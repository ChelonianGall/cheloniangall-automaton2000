 eulerscheZahl: Hi, i'm late to your community contest discussion from yesterday.They don't want more contests as they fear it might lower the player count for their main events
 eulerscheZahl: it's not even (or not mainly) about the effort, if the content comes from the community. They just don't want more.I pitched this one in August to get rejected now: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5118d71262a5772672a3a604a0a53942eb12">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5118d71262a5772672a3a604a0a53942eb12</a>
 Uljahn: hi, Euler, thanks for clarification, sad news indeed
 eulerscheZahl: at least we have a clear statement now. was in the void for long. now it will be something like the puzzle of thee week, just promoted a bit more (own tile on the homepage)
 eulerscheZahl: what defines a contest for me: everyone starts with nothing, gradual improvement, leagues, closing event with recalc and post mortemsbut that's not gonna happen
 735487: no contest anymore?
 YurkovAS: only clash contests :smile:
 dbf: it will puzzle of the week but with leatherboard and without leagues?
 eulerscheZahl: I don't know the details.I annoyed them to have a community contest. So they invited the regular users to a "brainstorming" session. and then it was all about how to attract new users
 eulerscheZahl: then the question that everyone of the regulars was thinking was asked: what about community contests? from there it went downhill
 eulerscheZahl: a vague concept is described on discord. at some point i shut down the computer to go for a walk
 dbf: yep, I've checked discord log quickly, I see their points, but it is sad that they are not able to launch community for a game that was ready before they announced their position
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, shit happens.with their promotion on the start page they max even get a high player count. but more casual players and less who try hard i think
 eulerscheZahl: and pretty much anything can get featured for 1-2 weeks: puzzle multi, optim, clash
 MadKnight: sad
 MadKnight: будем юзать сервис crypt'а чтобы гонять такие же контесты
 MadKnight: просто неофициальные
 MadKnight: Uljahn ты же играл в unofficial community contest&#160;?
 Uljahn: нет, только регился
 Uljahn: если это про то, о чём я подумал
 Uljahn: раньше мне CG представлялся платформой для про-кодеров и тех, кто стремится стать про, а теперь всё движется в сторону охвата более широких слоёв аудитории, т.е. нубов и школьников, от которых только спам и низкосортные клэши&#160;:(
 735487: я так и не понял. контесты вообще будут?
 eulerscheZahl: 2 official contests per year. that's all we get
 eulerscheZahl: it's even going so far that CG considers OoC a failure in hindsight. taking away players from pacman which was shortly after
 Uljahn: :weary:
 BorisZ: eulerscheZahl OoC was wonderful contest, simple rules and versatile further, you made a great work
 eulerscheZahl: i took over short before the contest. I knew about it 2 days before everyone else :D
 BorisZ: sad that staff don't want community contest anymore 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5118d71262a5772672a3a604a0a53942eb12">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5118d71262a5772672a3a604a0a53942eb12</a>this would have been my own creation
 BorisZ: they rejected it as contest, right? or as multi too&amp;
 BorisZ:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: as a contest. community can decide about multiplayer. i can't think of a scenario where it would get refused
 wlesavo: oh nice triangle game euler
 eulerscheZahl: still WIP, trictrac found a bug a few hours ago
 wlesavo: also completely missed the disscussion, thx for update
 BorisZ: bugs aren't a problem, all contests have some. 
 BorisZ: some sort of unofficial contest look a good idea - all in equal start position
 eulerscheZahl: i know. but now there is no need to hurry anymore so i can keep it WIP a few more days
 eulerscheZahl: was sitting on this game since August, took a while to get a reaction
 eulerscheZahl: the problem will be that we can't mobilize that many players without some official announcement. and even then it's not a contest
 eulerscheZahl: bitrunner was announced via email. less than 200 players during the "contest period"
 BorisZ: I hope this one will collect more - a lot of ppl have heard you was working on it:wink:
 BorisZ: and second - bitrunner was physic an simulation game, some ppl don't like that sort of stuff
 BorisZ: me for example :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: me too, I still don't have a bitrunner bot&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: Mean Max was a contest, was easier for me to find some motivation
 BorisZ: I can imagine your feeling:sweat:
 Uljahn: let them learn by consequences of their own decisions i guess
 735487: eulerscheZahl: i could say for my personal why i was not playing with bitrunner. first of all becaise it is unofficial. also it was overlapped for other event (dont remember which) or was so close to next contest.
 735487: also it was close to csb
 735487: so no way to get achievements for contest creators anymore?
 735487: the bad thing also could be that we dont have a leagues for that

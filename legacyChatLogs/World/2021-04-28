 AllIghtyPushFromPainOftheAkatsuk: hi
 AllIghtyPushFromPainOftheAkatsuk: hi
 Alex-1: hi AndyTM
 Wontonimo: SpringChallenge2020 is just so random.  One submit I'm Gold 450th, then the next Gold 80th with the same bot
 Wontonimo: seriously demotivating 
 Wontonimo: am i missing something?  Anyone here have any good traction on SpringChallenge2020?
 Astrobytes: which one was that? PacMan?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Astrobytes: I wasn't very keen on the game.
 Wontonimo: my implementation is similar to smitimax, except dynamic tree instead of fixed size
 Alex-1: we won from stream escape room
 struct: Just wait for pac man 2
 Wontonimo: sigh ... is that the next contest?
 Wontonimo: is there any word about the next challenge?
 struct: :zipper_mouth:
 Wontonimo: ah
 Astrobytes: Not sure smitsi is the way to go in pacman
 Astrobytes: But don't ask me. Don't think I bothered trying to get out of bronze
 Astrobytes: Admittedly I was on a lot of painkillers at the time.
 struct: I didnt like pacman
 Astrobytes: I didn't either.
 struct: I liked FC2020
 Alex-1: pacman is already exit in codingame
 DomiKo: FC2020 was great
 Wontonimo: my first implementation that got me very far was simply diffusing the value of each pellet along the paths in the maze, then making the pacs step in the direction of the largest diffused value.  1ply.  it did great, rocketed to top of silver.
 Alex-1: Admittedly I was on a lot of painkillers at the time. reply Astrobytes that not good
 Wontonimo: yeah, maybe walking away and doing a different contest would be best for mental health
 Astrobytes: Did you read the PMs?
 Astrobytes: Alex-1: back problem
 struct: or you can save yourself a bit until next contest
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes yeah, read a bunch.  
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 Wontonimo: there were complaints about some randomness, but the amount I'm experiencing is crazy, from nearly top of gold to bottom.  That isn't a bit random, that's a lot
 struct: I got pushed from 40th gold to legend
 Wontonimo: maybe people in the PM where pulling punches
 struct: in 1 day
 Astrobytes: I seem to remember lots of people complaining about turning corners only to insta-die
 Astrobytes: I mean, when you literally add rock paper and scissors to a game, with fog-of-war....
 Wontonimo: yeah.  FOW with narrow 90 degree angles.  insta-die is real
 struct: I hope next one doesnt have fog
 struct: are the creatures from the art also from zelda?
 Wontonimo: conceptually, i love the idea of dealing with unknowns.  practically speaking, i hate it.  I'm with you Struct
 struct: fog only makes sense on some games
 Astrobytes: OOC was a decent kind of fog
 struct: Wondev Woman and ooc
 struct: code busters
 Westicles: Next contest is based on My Neighbor Totoro: Aruite Sagaso Totoro`s Dondoko Game 
 alt0173: phoinggo
 Astrobytes: Westicles: sticking with the acorn theme I see :P
 Westicles: Yes, and those little beasts do look a bit like Totoro

 jacek: amazoNNs looking good <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Jr6Dykh.png">https://i.imgur.com/Jr6Dykh.png</a>
 jacek: but i wont submit until someone detronizes me
 struct: What does this mean?
 struct: I only see lines
 jacek: winrate against my current bot
 jacek: different lines are for different arch i experiment
 jacek: nevertheless I find &gt;90% winrate a success
 Wontonimo: which game jacek&#160;?
 jacek: amazons
 dbdr:     # e.g. d10d9d2 (move piece at d10 to d9 and wall d2)d10 on a 8x8 board?
 struct: ups
 jacek: who approved this garbage?
 struct: I had 10x10 board before
 struct: sorry
 Wontonimo: right ... cuz you said amazNNs 
 dbdr: :D
 Westicles: dbdr, looks like the chat wiki has been dead a while now?
 Astrobytes: Was working yesterday, just very, very slow
 struct: dbdr are you reading from github?
 struct: I dont see it on the live version
 dbdr: it's in the stub struct
 struct: ah
 struct: ty ty
 struct: Almost uploaded 16x16 by mistake 
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Westicles: You know, I was joking earlier, but he contest artwork was clearly based on this game
 kovi: while we are at it...dbdr, how you managed to stop fireworks spam with me having avg 3rd place for last 12 games...
 dbdr: it's my special "anti kovi" strat
 kovi: worked well
 dbdr: or more realistically, just randomness
 dbdr: since the pack order is random, there is a lot of noise I think
 dbdr: and top 3 is basically tied
 IceRize: someone wants to try escape with me?
 Westicles: Do you like piña coladas?
 struct: stuck on "Please wait, we are building your project..."&#160;:(

 DJSchaffner: How do you guys program more complex puzzles on cg? Do you program it in some IDE with multiple files and stuff everything in one file to work with cg in the end?Im looking for a nice way to convert a Java project into a single file :D
 ZarthaxX: bundler
 ZarthaxX: merger
 ZarthaxX: but yes, work with multiple and merge it in one
 Astrobytes: Yeah, for multis/contests. I think there's are one or two java mergers in the forum somewhere?

 struct: Everything on same file and I use cg IDE
 DJSchaffner: Alright i will take a look in the forums. Or does anyone have a link maybe?

 Smelty: Thank you, kind 17th follower
 Smelty: *18th
 KiwiTae: 19th! hehe
 BlaiseEbuth: You're strange... I don't like when people follow me. The last who's try is not here to tell anymore. :smiling_imp:
 KiwiTae: :joy: yolo
 BlaiseEbuth: :grin:
 Smelty: thank you kiwi
 Smelty: :rofl:
 jacek: clash follow?
 Smelty: hmm...
 5nr: I just played 3 CoC in a row, all of them were way too easy: many people finished in less than 1 minute. Are puzzles getting easier or is it just a case? Some time back it wasn't like this
 Smelty: its randomized i think
 struct: I think if there are new players the clashes are easier
 Smelty: also kiwi is my only follower who is of a higher level than me xD
 5nr: I see, thanks. I played more often few months back, and do not remember something like this
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt; I dont count im lvl30 since 2years ago lol
 Smelty: lol
 KiwiTae: 5nr maybe you improved n ow it feels easy
 Smelty: possible
 Smelty: i find myself way better at the calculating clashes rather than string modifying clashes
 booalgo: same :D
 Smelty: i take that back, just failed one
 Smelty: xzD
 Smelty: xD
 booalgo: xD
 KiwiTae: Smelty \o/ im gonna unfollow if u fail again

 ShaeShay: are there any games that teach lua instead of just doing it??
 Westicles: oh boy, here we go

 BlaiseEbuth: There's no damage...
 Denshire: attempted emotional damage then
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no shuch thing...

 Denshire: well attempted murder is a thing why not attempted emotional damage
 Denshire: same thing really
 Westicles: Wait, are there two lua guys now?  I am getting them mixed up
 BlaiseEbuth: Na. I mean I don't think he tried to make emotional damage.
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact he made me laugh, so that's ok.
 Westicles: There was the guy yesterday that can't learn Lua from videos because he has brain damage...
 BlaiseEbuth: And yes. Why another lua guy is appearing right now
 struct: lua is popular
 BlaiseEbuth: Conspiracy I say
 ShaeShay: i need help with lua
 Trist0214: ShaeShay: For the basics I would recommend a book or other learning resources, this is more for practice and extending knowledge than it is for teaching 
 struct: I can give you some tutorials in portuguese for lua
 struct: Since its a language made by brazilians
 King_Coda: lua is a "high level programming language"
 King_Coda: For some reason I either don't believe that, or I just don't care
 King_Coda: I think it's a combination of the 2
 Tony12C: tf
 ShaeShay: what book for lua do you rec?
 struct: Do you want to code lua while playing a game?
 struct: Garrys mod allows it
 Tony12C: Lua for dummies
 Trist0214: Lua Quick Start Guide: The Easiest Way to Learn Lua Programming
 BlaiseEbuth: Are you sure you know what "high level" mean King_Coda&#160;?

 BlaiseEbuth: Yesterday in fact.

 Smelty: Struct lol

 _Flippy: Someone motivated for a coding escape room&#160;?
 King_Coda: say it out loud
 King_Coda: yo gaes ai got thuh are tee ex thir tee nine tee
 Astrobytes: I can read it. I'm just curious as to why you felt the need to write it as if you're auditioning for a part in Idiocracy
 BlaiseEbuth: psychobytes
 King_Coda: Because I felt like it
 Westicles: King, I got just the book for you
 Westicles: Tahoe Leap Eyeball, Kink Shames Virgin
 Kitkat260: where is darklord
 BlaiseEbuth: An obfuscated version of the bible...
 Kitkat260: and kingcoda
 Astrobytes: From Chin Assess to Raffle Haitian
 King_Coda: "Kink shames virgin"
 ApolloMS1: What is the easiest form of code to learn?
 Astrobytes: Morse.
 King_Coda: that's kinda hot ngl
 BlaiseEbuth: square
 ApolloMS1: I meant computer programming. I already know morse.
 BlaiseEbuth: Binary
 BlaiseEbuth: 0 and 1 that's it
 BlaiseEbuth: ezpz
 ApolloMS1: Thanks.
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 King_Coda: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: I tend to recommend C++ first. Unpopular opinion maybe but I stand by it.
 King_Coda: the second he walks into chat, ApolloMS1 just gets lighted
 Nicholas_003: C
 ApolloMS1: OK, thanks!
 King_Coda: I would recommend C# before learning C++
 BlaiseEbuth: C more than C++
 Trist0214: C++ is a good one tbh, you'll know pretty soon if you dislike coding
 King_Coda: but that's just me
 Astrobytes: C++: you can write C code in it
 Astrobytes: Or you can go modern
 ApolloMS1: Ok, thank you for the input! I am gonna go learn C++ now!
 BlaiseEbuth: what's that fallacious arg :rofl:
 King_Coda: coolio
 <b>**King_Coda finally gets of his chair to go do his school work</b></p><p><img src="/a/59449061195531" /> BlaiseEbuth: And he said "the simpliest to learn"

 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ 09ᄅʇɐʞʇıʞ

 Astrobytes: Poor fishbot is probably a fshbot by now.
 Wontonimo: i agree that coding C will really help you know whats going on abstractly
 Wontonimo: if the student is really into pretty colours and doesn't like math and logic, i'd not recommend C.
 Astrobytes: Yeah totally, that's where I was going with the subsequent "learn how things work or not" comment.Though - it can't hurt to do at least a little.
 King_Coda: i wonder what exactly a fishbot is
 Astrobytes: A robotic fish?
 krishna_jalan_: some one up for coding escape mode?
 EllipticBike38: an elettric silverfish?
 jacek: escape becoming the new clash eh
 Astrobytes: Nah. Takes longer.
 Astrobytes: Escape &gt; CoC though, imo
 jacek: i meant chat spamming
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Astrobytes: Yeah, seems so
 krishna_jalan_: hmm, 
 Kitkat260: kingcoda
 BlaiseEbuth: -&gt; #escape
 Astrobytes: krishna_jalan_: I won't do it as I've done them already
 krishna_jalan_: okay
 King_Coda: that's because it's easier and more accesible to people without coding experience

 orangesnowfox: I'm boring af
 jacek: dunno
 Kitkat260: no u r not
 King_Coda: people started following me for no reason
 jacek: maybe this is twitter
 Kitkat260: so u want me to un follow you
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably huntsmen orangesnowfox, be careful.
 Astrobytes: Followed orangesnowfox :P
 Kitkat260: same
 jacek: what a bunch of trolls
 Astrobytes: Kitkat260: Not being funny, but if you could just go somewhere else that would be excellent. I am sure there are other better places to fulfil whatever need it is you have.

 King_Coda: just followed orangesnowfox
 Kitkat260: just trying to be nicee
 BlaiseEbuth: Have a break KitKat.

 Kitkat260: she can help me
 King_Coda: "Calculations Involving Colligative Properties". What does that even mean?
 Astrobytes: chemistry problem?
 King_Coda: Not a problem, no.
 Astrobytes: Context?
 King_Coda: Just don't appreciate the american education system
 King_Coda: Why are they teaching me this garbage. Why do I have to go out of my own way just to learn the stuff i'll ACTUALLY use.
 Astrobytes: I used chemistry a fair bit doing my biology degree and cell biology masters
 Krakenus00: Don't you think that python is imbalanced in Clash of Code? It takes much less time to write the needed code and it is much smaller.
 Astrobytes: Try ruby Krakenus00
 Astrobytes: brb
 King_Coda: Python is a bit OP tbh
 King_Coda: it's won me a few clashes
 VizGhar: I learnt ruby just to beat everybody in CoC
 Krakenus00: Nah. Actually, I want to have fun, using my favourite C++, but can't win Python guys.
 VizGhar: "everybody" :P
 Krakenus00: CoC[k]
 VizGhar: Shortest is funny CoC... you can simply google 15 minutes
 King_Coda: :laughing:
 jacek: if you want to have fun, what do you clash? ;v
 VizGhar: I'm not clashing anymore. But some might find it funny
 BlaiseEbuth: jacek is faster than me

 jacek: Krakenus00 have you tried something else than clash here?
 VizGhar: But to be honest, I picked some of those clashes as assignments/exercises for my students
 VizGhar: sometimes there are some good ideas
 jacek: as punishment?
 Krakenus00: I've tried everything
 VizGhar: of course. Do you think they want to code for fun?
 Krakenus00: Just play CoC sometimes
 VizGhar: and what exactly you need Krakenus00&#160;?
 Denshire: imagine coding for fun pfft who does that
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: The Crow of Judgement is my Spirit Animal
 VizGhar: Sure Astrobytes :D
 VizGhar: ok, time to put kids to sleep... see ya in 2 hrs :P
 Astrobytes: Well, Corvids in general. Cya in a bit&#160;:)
 Krakenus00: I think it would be better to separate CoCs by language. i.e. there are only devs with the same language in the room.
 Astrobytes: You can do that with private clashes I believe Krakenus00
 KelvinAndHubbles: why is solving sudoku a medium puzzle while solving mini sudoku is hard?
 Krakenus00: Uh, that's sad, cause I have no friends or colleagues
 King_Coda: Mini sudoku provides less options, and smaller room for error.
 King_Coda: .msg Tychkorg
 Astrobytes: You can still make a clash and post it in #clash channel then ask in here if anyone wants to join an x language clash Krakenus00
 King_Coda: oops
 Smelty: yes
 King_Coda: all of the games belong to saltaxatlas
 Astrobytes: This account is a CodinGame bot for Clash of Code.
 Smelty: sure

 Astrobytes: Tychkorg is a clash bot

 King_Coda: I was going to compliment their Will Ferrell pfp
 King_Coda: How many CoC bots are there?
 pindsz: 8 i thinnk
 King_Coda: who is this saltAxAtlas guy and why does he make a clash every 10 minutes
 Astrobytes: A guy who likes clashing?
 KiwiTae: ^
 Astrobytes: Oh, he's livestreaming on Twitch
 Astrobytes: Or was
 King_Coda: How does he get the clash_bot to announce his clashes
 synchoz: King_Coda every one here is trying to improve :D 
 King_Coda: is it because he streams on twitch?
 Astrobytes: I think you put Codingame in the title of your stream and the twitch bot picks it up KingSherriff
 Astrobytes: *King_Coda
 King_Coda: OOHHHHH
 Astrobytes: Apologies KingSherriff whoever you are
 King_Coda: RIIIIGHT
 King_Coda: I knew that
 King_Coda: Man, what about my boys streaming over on youtube, huh?
 King_Coda: We can't leave them out
 Astrobytes: I think for that you post in the streaming channel on discord
 Astrobytes: I don't know the public YT API
 King_Coda: *sigh* On twitch you have control over your audience with all of it's fancy features, but on youtube your audience controls you.
 jacek: soviet yt eh
 Astrobytes: In Soviet YT, *you* are The Algorithm
 King_Coda: Our Algorithm
 jacek: is Automaton2000 an algorithm
 Automaton2000: happens to me as well, but it is much faster than you think
 Astrobytes: :D
 King_Coda: I'm going to get x rays for my wisdom tooth today
 King_Coda: hooray for me
 Astrobytes: Let's hope you're still as wise thereafter...
 jacek: still?
 King_Coda: Haha, I was never wise
 King_Coda: Perhaps one day I will be.
 King_Coda: But that day is not today

 EllipticBike38: well yes but actually not. Internet explorer still exists
 King_Coda: Good
 King_Coda: Hmm, i wonder what "end process" does

 Astrobytes: Don't worry King_Coda, when I was pre-teen years I had too many teeth growing in, I had 8 surgically removed under local anaesthetic and 4 under general. You got this.
 King_Coda: Haha, thanks Astrobytes. I will admit i'm a little nervous. Never had to undergo oral surgery before.
 Astrobytes: Local or general anaesthetic?
 struct: im going to say general
 King_Coda: whats the difference?
 struct: one puts you to sleep
 Astrobytes: General puts you to sleep, local numbs your gums
 struct: its like variables local variables vs global variables
 King_Coda: idk, my Mom said i wouldn't be put to sleep, but then the doctor said that I would
 KiwiTae: King_Coda the pain starts when the anaestetics fades
 King_Coda: My mom is the manager there, but the doctor is the doctor so like...
 King_Coda: i don't know who to trust
 Astrobytes: Just go with it. Trust me, it can't be worse than having 8 removed surgically (some just pulled) under local
 KiwiTae: u'll survive I had a jaw bone removed with 12teeths at once i just woke up lighter
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes competition :joy:
 King_Coda: Yeah, I heard the first 2 days after surgery are the worst
 Astrobytes: Owwww KiwiTae dude, you win

 BigFatDecker: lol im guessing nobody can help?
 Astrobytes: I could drink vegetable oil or something I suppose.
 Astrobytes: :P
 King_Coda: You're Vegitarian Astrobytes?
 jacek: BigFatDecker i never did gpt-2 sorreh
 jacek: also i dont get the error. where do you try to use that?
 jacek: maybe give more code
 King_Coda: oh i have a brain freeze now
 Astrobytes: King_Coda: yeah for almost 5 years now I think

 King_Coda: Ooh, 5 years no meat? I wouldn't last 5 days.
 Astrobytes: Not that I hate meat or anything, but I don't like the mass farming industry, the quality is bad, good meat costs a fortune and animals are not looked after as they should be.
 King_Coda: Okay, well that's fair.
 Astrobytes: I used to be a chef, I loved good meat.
 Astrobytes: :P
 King_Coda: You don't even eat fish? I used to catch my own fish for dinner all the time.
 Astrobytes: Seriously though, yeah. When you taste that crap that's in supermarkets and most fast-food - it's a straight up no.
 KiwiTae: BigFatDecker you tried import encoder as encpkg? maybe its confused with the encoder class nae
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm not completely averse to a little bit once in a while, but there's so much overfishing, and pollution in local waterways. IT's grim.
 Mr_PhM: hai
 King_Coda: That's good Astrobytes. I just fish out of a small glacier-fed lake. Trout and whatnot.
 King_Coda: Ah yes, yet another "hi"-er
 Astrobytes: Glorious fishing, I used to fish for trout round here when I was younger, and pike up at the canal just for the fight
 Astrobytes: Used to go poaching at the salmon lochs/rivers too, but usually we were too drunk to do any fishing after setting up the rods :D
 King_Coda: You sound... so very scottish right now Astrobytes. It's quite charming :laughing:
 Astrobytes: I wonder why that might be :thinking:
 King_Coda: :thinking: hmmm
 Astrobytes: Also the gamekeeper used to come and chase you
 King_Coda: :point_up::grinning: perhaps it's because you are Scottish?
 Astrobytes: At the salmon places (you need a permit)
 Astrobytes: No shit Sherlock :P
 King_Coda: Sounds like a lot of fun and mischief
 Astrobytes: We'd just sit there and go "aye check the rods man, wur too pished" and he'd leave us alone
 Astrobytes: Did do some good poaching once in a while too though.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, really fun times I admit
 King_Coda: I'm goin up to lake chelan in the summer with my gramps. Perhaps we ought to do some fishing.

 King_Coda: He turned me on to it at the young age of 5
 Astrobytes: Fishing, camping, general wilderness stuff I always recommend
 Astrobytes: lol jacek, I had a Congolese workmate who used to heat up his fish curry in the staff kitchen. It smelled like actual Hell but it tasted amazing :D
 Astrobytes: I've also made salted cod pierogis, that salted cod reeks a bit when you soak it
 King_Coda: Sounds tasty though.
 Astrobytes: Anything with salted cod is usually good
 Astrobytes: Ackee and saltfish (the Jamaican dish) is epic, though I used to make it with smoked pork sometimes
 Astrobytes: *salt-cured smoked pork
 Astrobytes: A brine works just as well for meat tbh
 King_Coda: Oooooh, i've had a brined chicken once
 King_Coda: I almost ate the whole damned thing in one night
 King_Coda: it was so good :grin:
 Astrobytes: It's an oldskool method, and it needs decent meat - you cannot polish a turd.
 King_Coda: :rofl:
 King_Coda: true
 Astrobytes: And when it's good, it's amazing.
 samueI: im learning ruby
 King_Coda: never really cared much for ruby
 King_Coda: don't see the point in learning it tbh
 Astrobytes: If you like clashing on here it's worth it
 King_Coda: Eh, CoC isn't really my thing
 Astrobytes: Also it does actually have real world uses that are not going away any time soon
 King_Coda: what uses are those?
 Astrobytes: Do I look like I code Ruby? I'm a cat!
 King_Coda: Hahaha, indeed. It seems to be a lot like Python in that it can be used for just about anything
 King_Coda: Doesn't really strike me as something I would like to learn. I'll just stick with the C languages and Javascript thank you very much
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a general purpose scripting lang, but has a few frameworks that are very much in use still
 Uljahn: like RoR?
 Astrobytes: Heh yeah
 King_Coda: Ruby on rails?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 King_Coda: Hmmmm... not really into the web side of coding tbh
 King_Coda: I'll stick with the video game stuff
 Astrobytes: What's your javascript fetish for then?
 King_Coda: Just because it's used in almost everything. Not like I want to learn it, I just have to.
 King_Coda: Twitch uses Rails? Interesting.
 Astrobytes: But it's not used in everything.
 Astrobytes: Or even almost everything.
 King_Coda: Seems like it.
 Astrobytes: You're looking at web, frontends, backends, you'll see it a lot.It has plenty uses elsewhere but I guarantee that's where you're seeing that it's needed
 Astrobytes: *web frontends &amp; backends
 King_Coda: You talking about Ruby, not javascript, right?
 Astrobytes: javascript
 King_Coda: Okay, just making sure.
 Astrobytes: To confirm, you did mention you were wanting to do some kind of game programming? Or was that someone else King_Coda?
 King_Coda: No that was me.
 King_Coda: I know Javascript is very inefficient to use for games, I just thought it would be a good common language to learn.
 DomiKo: Ohhh yes win aginst MSmi.. in connect4 :D 
 Astrobytes: Learn data structures, learn basic algorithms, learn something that you can work with to show you results.There are levels. You can want an API just to do most things for you and you just script it. Or you can go lower level and want to make parts of the system.
 Astrobytes: Nice Domiko. I disabled my C4 bot the other day after breaking it and not finding the bug. Need rewrite.
 DomiKo:&#160;:( 
 DomiKo: rewriting is often paintful
 Astrobytes: Nah. Sometimes it's for the best!
 OBenjOne: Is there a way to save data between games in coders strike back? I want to write data to a file and then use that data to change how future games are played If that's possible. I am only asking this because the game suggested a neural network or machine learning was a skill useful in the higher leagues
 OBenjOne: When I create a file it does not seem to save 
 DomiKo: nope you can't
 King_Coda: I forgot that Java and Javascript are two different things.
 Astrobytes: Ah. You have to download replays if you want that information. And run simulations locally OBenjOne
 DomiKo: You have to train the network offline and then upload trained version to CG
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: You can use some kind of online search with great success though.
 OBenjOne: oh ok thanks for the advice
 King_Coda: Darn, am I going to have to learn both?
 Astrobytes: OBenjOne: this might be helpful regarding scraping replays etc<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out early tonight, gn all
 Astrobytes: or good day/afternoon/morning
 King_Coda: Good afternoon Astrobytes
 OBenjOne: thanks
 King_Coda: Nevermind, looks like I'll be sticking with javascript
 MassiveMaster_bbcd: hello
 King_Coda: we need a code of conduct rule that states that it is against guidelines to come into chat and only say the word "hello" "hi" "hai" or "hru"
 pardouin: o/
 pardouin: (kidding)
 MassiveMaster_bbcd: im still here
 MassiveMaster_bbcd: just saying hello
 MassiveMaster_bbcd: geez
 King_Coda: lol imagine
 Roxxx: Hello World!&#160;;)
 struct: hi
 RescuedCookie22: hai
 Roxxx: @King_Coda i usually write hello, whenever i log in so people know that i'm online and that they can contact me, nothing wrong with saying hi&#160;:)

 JustAProgrammer01234: everyone
 Mortalitor: Hello World to you too
 Dan4Life: hELlo_woRlD
 Dan4Life: :point_up:
 JustAProgrammer01234: how long have you guys been programming?
 orangesnowfox: Uhh... 6 years? more?
 King_Coda: Nothing wrong with saying hello
 King_Coda: It just gets annoying sometimes when a string of 17 people say it non-stop for 10 minutes straight
 Smart_Widgeon: @JustAProgrammer01234 4 years
 JustALaptopUser: hello
 Stormalix: a year and a half
 BlaiseEbuth: :older_man:
 Stormalix: :eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: Something like 13 years or something... 
 BlaiseEbuth: Half of my life! :scream:
 orangesnowfox: BlaiseEbuth: By the time I'm your age I'll have been programming for a bit over half my life :smirk:
 BlaiseEbuth: Poor child... Go play outside! Now!
 orangesnowfox: I'm... 19
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... :baby:
 orangesnowfox: w-with a full time job?I grew up so fast :sob: (/lh/j)
 BlaiseEbuth: Who needs a job...
 BlaiseEbuth: Grow up. And go make money like an adult, by playing games, making vlogs on youtube, or asmr on twitch.
 Smelty: xD
 King_Coda: lol
 crystal_prince: hello
 AndrewJason: chat section be like ...
 Alex-1: hi
 Alex-1: hi
 justonjay: holla
 Alex-1: hi BlaiseEbuth
 Smelty: um for the byte pair encoding, how do I output the appropriate number of repititions given a string such as "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcccccccccc"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/51898d3e-e3a5-4b88-8950-e07b114b5142">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/51898d3e-e3a5-4b88-8950-e07b114b5142</a>
 Smelty: also, what variables do you use after you run out of the Z,Y,X,....,A
 Alex-1: hi Smelty
 Smelty: hi
 Alex-1: what was going
 Smelty: i was doing byte pair encoding
 Alex-1: i tried it but failed
 Smelty: currently have two problems: same chars in a row and what substitutes to use after z-a
 Smelty: (currently has a 40% TwT)

 UndercoverToad: i have a major bug in my move generator but when I fix it, scoring falls apart and all hell breaks loose :sob:
 UndercoverToad: I don't generate SEED after GROW from size 0 to 1
 ZarthaxX: you beated me anyway
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: beated?
 NinjaDoggy: @toad
 NinjaDoggy: don't worry it's not a bug it's a feature&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: oh, a doggy is near me
 NinjaDoggy: i tell my bot not to generate seed from 1 cost
 NinjaDoggy: oh i was like "i'm above toady :D "
 UndercoverToad: getting in line before legend, aren't we&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: then i realized u just submitted&#160;:(
 dbdr: nice unintentional pruning, UndercoverToad :D
 NinjaDoggy: but yea i bought my ticket for the legend train&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: i was 13th when I woke up
 NinjaDoggy: yeh u were around there the whole time
 NinjaDoggy: u know what pushed my bot from ~50 - 100 to top 20?
 NinjaDoggy: don't complete until day 12&#160;:)
 dbdr: just in line to be below the boss at opening&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:( top 20 is legend&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: don't jinx me&#160;:(
 dbdr: that was for the toad, you'll be fine NinjaDoggy&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: ahhh thanks :D
 MADDY-1: hii
 dbdr: even if you're below him. the gold boss moves in mysterious ways
 Wontonimo: what's the "usual" cut off for legend?  For Gold they did about 635.  Has legend been real small in past competitions?
 dbdr: 15-20
 Wontonimo: *sigh*
 Wontonimo: that's what i get for dragging my feet the first 3 days of the competition and taking shortcuts in my sim
 dbdr: legend has no value if it's too big. it's an achievement to get in
 Wontonimo: once legend opens, is there a gold boss that you can beat to get in, or  is it locked?
 dbdr: there's a boss
 Wontonimo: thanks dbdr
 dbdr: will be the target for many players
 UndercoverToad: gold boss is nothing you want to be yourself. players will optimize their strategies against you
 UndercoverToad: vlavv is probably a good candidate if legend would open right now
 UndercoverToad: not c++ and in the right range
 NinjaDoggy: why does not C++ matter?
 UndercoverToad: i don't know. I just rarely see a C++ boss
 UndercoverToad: what matters is the thinking time though
 UndercoverToad: they want a fast boss, as it will get lots of matches
 UndercoverToad: those C++ bots tend to be search-heavy
 UndercoverToad: and the typescipt guy submitted some bogus I think
 UndercoverToad: was higher before
 NinjaDoggy: maybe bots have improved that much :P
 UndercoverToad: he's next to my C# competitor around rank 30
 UndercoverToad: that one hasn't submitted for a while and was in a similar range yesterday
 UndercoverToad: and i think i could locate the source of the terrible smell in my room
 UndercoverToad: it's coming out of the roof. i guess a mouse just died there and will smell in all eternity&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 ZarthaxX: nasty toad
 dbdr: yeah, perl boss would be fun
 ZarthaxX: plz dont submit you hurt my feelings and score too :rofl:
 dbdr: with a non-search bot, there is a bigger chance of a cheese though. but probably not in this game
 NinjaDoggy: toad
 NinjaDoggy: why are you so nice to me &lt;3
 NinjaDoggy: 5-0 thanks!
 UndercoverToad:&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: sucking his score
 UndercoverToad: i should just quit once i reach legend
 UndercoverToad: i hate this game
 UndercoverToad: i hate all contest games after a while
 UndercoverToad: but i started hating this one early
 Marchete: you wake up so early
 UndercoverToad: the early toad catches the worm
 UndercoverToad: and i'm frustrated
 Marchete: the toad doesn't catch the mouse
 Marchete: and you are frustated by that too
 UndercoverToad: that's a problem. I can hear them running under the roof
 ZarthaxX: why do you hate it and you are so high
 ZarthaxX: damn toad
 ZarthaxX: sexy toad
 UndercoverToad: i'm dropping. i even fear a rank below top50 :scream:
 ZarthaxX: what?
 UndercoverToad: at the end of the contest of course
 UndercoverToad: after a hard weeekend
 UndercoverToad: but tomorrow is codejam day
 UndercoverToad: I hate that as well. for the 2nd year in a row the CG contest happens during codejam round 2
 CouscousAgha: is it fair when top 50 players re-submit and obviously win against random people in top 300 and just make them de-rank 5 spots
 PatrickMcGinnisII: silver boss is pissing me off, but I haven't submitted in silver at all
 UndercoverToad: that's just how trueskill works
 UndercoverToad: it's designed for human players. who might get worse and lose skills
 aangairbender: I lose to random people al lthe time xD
 UndercoverToad: so if you win against a noob you may have lost some skill. just not enough to lose the game. conservative estimation
 aangairbender: but eventually system puts me back to top50
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, 41st in silver, might as well shoot myself in the foot
 ZarthaxX: aangairbender resubmit
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad good luck in codejam!
 ZarthaxX: beat touris t
 aangairbender: I am trying new approach where I eval actions instead of states, UndercoverToad have you tried such approach?
 UndercoverToad: thank, i'm happy if i reach top 1000
 ZarthaxX: t shirt :D
 ZarthaxX: how is the design
 UndercoverToad: didn't check
 UndercoverToad: also top 1000 qualifies for round 3
 CouscousAgha: my 3 last losses 2 of them were vs top 50 and top 64
 UndercoverToad: i have a bit of such an approach in my current bot aangairbender
 UndercoverToad: but want to get away from it
 aangairbender: ZarthaxX resubmitted, lets see
 CouscousAgha: made me descend 10 ranks for no reason lol
 aangairbender: why you want to get away from it? It seems interesting for me
 UndercoverToad: how do you even get matches against much higher ranked players CouscousAgha?
 ZarthaxX: aangairbender oh shit i thought you wouldnt do it
 CouscousAgha: I guess when they re submit their code
 UndercoverToad: ah
 ZarthaxX: oh top 1k qualifies :O
 aangairbender: ZarthaxX actually I submitted my version before last, it was a bit stronger (60%wr again last one)
 UndercoverToad: because that's carrying some score history and I only want to rate the outcome
 aangairbender: at least it doesnt lose to random guys until ~rank 150
 DarkLord__28: hiii
 MADDY-1: Spring Challange is Nice
 CouscousAgha: i got matched again vs a top 50 and descended 4 ranks again lol
 CouscousAgha: im now below bots i mostly win against 
 CouscousAgha: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 DCoderOP: happy Akshaya Trtitya
 DarkLord__28: happy Akshya tritya sir
 ZarthaxX: aangairbender oh ok
 ZarthaxX: meanwhile im getting smaehd&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: that's what I thought when I submitted. but it was the other polar bear
 ZarthaxX: e.e
 ZarthaxX: im a bit higher thanh im
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lost almost 2000 ranks in submit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er 200
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only 1.5 pts difference, close game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gn,glhf
 CouscousAgha: gonna go sleep now
 Marchete: now?
 CouscousAgha: hopefully this game will stop matching me vs people above 50
 CouscousAgha: because this is unfair lol
 Marchete: In morocco the sun is rising...
 CouscousAgha: yes
 Marchete: :D
 MADDY-1: :smile:
 CouscousAgha: it's 4:50am now
 Marchete: good day? then
 CouscousAgha: LOL
 CouscousAgha: thank you
 dbdr: CouscousAgha playing against top players happens to everyone, randomly, so it's fair
 dbdr: in the worst case, resubmit&#160;;)
 padobranac: i need one more upvote for a challenge. Anyone care to check it out?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6656a8357853e2d23c7dd53688f011ebe3ee">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6656a8357853e2d23c7dd53688f011ebe3ee</a>
 Smelty: sure!
 Smelty: seems nice,upvoted
 padobranac: thanks
 MADDY-1: hii guys
 UndercoverToad: another Caesar Cipher?
 Maliamnon: 1 in silver rn :grimacing:
 GareBearH: hey
 GareBearH: im looking for peers to work with
 GareBearH: i know all the basics along with a few imports and im a quick learner
 Ajaiy2: Which language?
 GareBearH: python 
 Ajaiy2: Im C# and I know a bit of python
 GareBearH: forgot to specify, sorry :sweat_smile:
 GareBearH: how much
 Ajaiy2: Till the simple mathematical operations like trunc, ord, ceil
 GareBearH: okay, and the built in functions too like if, print, input, yknow the really basic stuff
 davilla: import horse
 Ajaiy2: Yes, I know that and the ternary operators too
 GareBearH: k
 Marchete: Let's see how LAHC works
 Marchete: on the game
 Marchete: I like it because it's as simple as MC to code
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc027593-50bf-47fb-ada3-e208cdbaff21">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc027593-50bf-47fb-ada3-e208cdbaff21</a>
 Marchete: like a 9 lines algo
 Ajaiy2: I have a beam search of width 1 and it works nice
 Marchete: width 1? :D
 Thienu: isnt that equivalent to a depth 1 bfs
 Ajaiy2: Well, I only choose the lowest index
 NinjaDoggy: no it's equivalent to a greedy strategy
 Ajaiy2: Yes
 NinjaDoggy: outputting a random move is equivalent to 1 iterations MCTS&#160;:)
 Notter: Is it hardcoding to write an array just to convert from cell id to coordinates?
 NinjaDoggy: yes, but it's ok to hardcode
 KCrown: I swear with each new submission Im dropping in rank 
 NinjaDoggy: on average resubmits will be lower in rank
 NinjaDoggy: if you don't change your bot, but other bots are(on average) improving. Then resubmitting will drop ranks
 KCrown: still not very encouraging
 NinjaDoggy: just reassuring you that you're not going crazy&#160;;)
 MADDY-1: guys why codingame
 KCrown: :P
 KCrown: insanity 
 KCrown: I knew from the last 3 times I should have coded a sim
 dbdr: gg kovi!
 kovi: thx dbdr
 kovi: found a major bug yesterday 50-&gt;top5
 Ajaiy2: After few fixes, my code ends up with 12 fully grown trees
 Ajaiy2: Which is shocking
 KCrown: thats about the point where you notice this thing call nutrients ... 
 NinjaDoggy: Kovi nice!
 Ajaiy2: mhm
 NinjaDoggy: feels good when bug fixing doesn't make you go from top 50 to top 500&#160;:)
 KCrown: cause at that point ur tress is costing you more points to grow then to complete :P 
 NinjaDoggy: ok new bot beats old bot &gt; 2:1 please don't drop 
 MADDY-1: i am new coder in codingame
 Stormalix: welcome c:
 Westicles: welcome MADDY-1
 KiwiTae: there is a contest? wow
 KiwiTae: o/
 KiwiTae: MADDY-1 are you MK alt? :joy:
 Ajaiy2: Just need a slight tweak to beat the silver boss
 DamianS6: Well, yesterday evening I left my bot being sure I'd need to improve it to get to the gold (it was quite stable around silver 30-40) so I was quite surprised it got promoted and it's even not at the very bottom
 DamianS6: As for my 1st challenge, quite stupid if/else bot of 110 python lines I have to say I'm even glad of it :upside_down:
 Bernard_Lowe: Anyone else getting error code (#14): submitted code is too big.
 Bernard_Lowe: error code (#314)***
 Ajaiy2: How much lines?
 jrke: did you made code more than of 100k chars? 
 Bernard_Lowe: lol no. Only 2,400 lines.
 jrke: 100k chars not lines
 Bernard_Lowe: if I try to put last battle into IDE, I get this error too.
 jrke: then your code is more than 100k chars
 jrke: open any code golf puzzle
 jrke: and see the code size
 Bernard_Lowe: ok, I've never done code golf. I should be able to put last battle history into ide, it was working earlier.
 Marchete: MADDY-1 is hiding his bot
 raxkin: good morning!
 dbdr: hey Marchete! are you hiding too?&#160;;)
 Marchete: I wish
 Illedan: No NN for this Marchete?
 Marchete: nope
 Marchete: it seems hard to NNize
 Illedan: I have ideas, but no time
 Marchete: too much items going on
 Marchete: yeah I haven't time with week
 kovi: welcome back illedan
 Marchete: so just sim + crappy search + crappy eval
 Marchete: as usual
 dbdr: anyone has this issue with the local ref?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/Q6Wrxs.jpg">https://snipboard.io/Q6Wrxs.jpg</a>
 Illedan: :D
 Marchete: I needed 7 days for the simulation ...
 Illedan: I will try to rewrite this weekend if I get some time inbetween life
 Illedan: *rewrite the code
 Marchete: yeah, you dropped a bit 
 Illedan: I didn't submit in 5 days though
 Marchete: you can do it
 Illedan: Legend should be fine I guess
 Marchete: beat the toad in C# :D
 Illedan: Ofc
 Illedan: No sleep until toad is beaten
 Marchete: just remember him the mouse
 kovi: ambitous goal
 Illedan: anyway, work calls. cya in Legend
 dbdr: watch out, gold boss will be in perl
 Marchete: euler said that
 Marchete: that CG prefers fast execution bosses
 dbdr: and exotic languages
 kovi: go and typescript still has a chance
 solistice: Hi guys, I transformed most of my code to bitboards, but I am still still struggling with number of sims
 solistice: is there someone who has some time today to go through what I did?
 Marchete: sim or move generation?
 Marchete: in my case movegen takes up to 74% of cpu time
 solistice: you generate moves in sim, no?
 Marchete: well, yes
 Marchete: but it can be indepently done
 Marchete: like if you have a hash
 Marchete: maybe you can check it first
 Marchete: to see if it's a duplicate gamestate
 Marchete: so you won't movegen it
 Al_ir_eza00: how i can see solve this clash of codes?
 mybk: what do you mean&#160;? 
 itzluku: i need 2ms to gen moves by set width
 itzluku: xD
 itzluku: up to 2ms*
 Marchete: 2ms per state?
 itzluku: ...
 Marchete: ahhh python :D
 Marchete: gotcha
 itzluku: i dont have a bitboard
 Marchete: movegen is slow because of bitboards
 Marchete: in my case
 itzluku: sometimes even 3ms
 itzluku: wtf
 Marchete: simulate 30 times and pray
 itzluku: i still need to add sun, pointdiff and probability normalization for depth
 Marchete: pointdiff?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I am having trouble setting/clearing bits in the second half of a 64 bit integer with c++. Has anyone had success with this?
 itzluku: yup pointdiff gets more important to the end
 itzluku: if u have more points u win :D
 Marchete: ensure you use (1ULL &lt;&lt; shift)
 Marchete: 1ULL is different from 1
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh ok. so shift can still be greater than 32?
 Marchete: in uint64_t yes
 Marchete: but if you use 1 the compiler can use uint32_t
 Marchete: for shifting, and you won't get the expected result
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok awesome thanks I'll try it out
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: I'll be in chat instead of coding :D
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: it works!
 pmor: are you sure why?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I spent probably an hour trying to figure that out and I couldn't before
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Nah I'm still not sure why it works lol
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: but it works so who cares
 pmor: :laughing:
 Marchete: always ask on chat
 Marchete: most of us had the same problems for hours
 UndercoverToad: you mean you had?
 Marchete: like me, at some point I tried to do some number&#160;% another
 Marchete: and it seems that if any number was negative it goes reaaaally bad
 UndercoverToad: try python, that has a modulo function which always returns a number &gt;= 0
 Marchete: int64_t is very different than uint64_t
 Marchete: I learned the hard way when generating random numbers
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I saw some people using unsigned long long online but it didn't seem to work for me (because I didn't shift with 1ULL I guess)
 Marchete: I never use these naming conventions sorry
 Marchete: uint64_t for me
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: well I can't be bothered typing unsigned long long all the time so uint64_t for me also
 Marchete: you can also use UINT64_C()
 Marchete: I don't use it
 Marchete: for constants of uint64_t
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ah ok
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: is it possible to calculate seed options with bitboards?
 Marchete: it's the best option
 Marchete: calc freeSpaces
 Marchete: for each tree calc range
 Marchete: range &amp; freeSpace
 Marchete: success
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok that makes sense
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: doing tree by tree means you have to loop through the bits in a bitboard right?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: most of use use either trailing zero count or leading zero count
 Marchete: to get first or last bit fast
 Marchete:  trailing zero count = an operation on modern CPUs
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: and then once you find first or last bit you iterate bit by bit from there for the next ones?
 Marchete: not a custom made function
 Marchete: use bit, remove it
 Marchete: find the last bit again
 UndercoverToad: the toad is back :frog:
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: thanks Marchete
 kovi: nice euler!
 UndercoverToad: but you are hitting me hard kovi
 UndercoverToad: you and bowwow are my only &lt; 50%
 UndercoverToad: too few games to be significant of course
 Marchete: some new feature or just paramtuning?
 Marchete: wow 3rd
 UndercoverToad: i completely dumped my old scoring and started from scratch this morning
 UndercoverToad: not completely but mostly at least
 Marchete: nice
 Marchete: good job
 UndercoverToad: legend here I come \o/
 Marchete: was it ever a question?
 UndercoverToad: for me it was. now i'm growing confidence
 Marchete: :unamused:
 UndercoverToad: i was sure that i will make it. just not if my old bot would make it
 UndercoverToad: Illedan 09:24AMOfcNo sleep until toad is beaten
 UndercoverToad: this will be a long night
 Marchete: weekend*
 Marchete: also he didn't specify on what game
 UndercoverToad: it's implied without him saying
 Marchete: I'm trying to saving him from sleep deprivation
 UndercoverToad: he didn't specify which toad either but we all know
 Marchete: saying the toad will uncover you
 ddreams: dbdr yes, the small graphics are included as a sprite, but apparently there's something that should split it up
 ddreams: haven't looked into what's missing
 dbf: UndercoverToad, nice improvement with last submit!
 Nerchio: why are you undercover toad
 allla: Hello World
 UndercoverToad: thanks dbf, dumping some code was a good idea
 UndercoverToad: Nerchio chat gets extremely laggy for moderators as every user on chat is visible
 Nerchio: oh ok 
 Nerchio: i was wondering why they keep saying euler
 Nerchio: when you were not in chat
 Nerchio: i know, pretty slow thinking
 Nerchio: :joy:
 UndercoverToad: hover over my avatar
 Nerchio: now i see
 mybk: guys what are the reasons for timing out  ? 
 UndercoverToad: taking more than 100ms for your turn
 UndercoverToad: infinite loop,
 UndercoverToad: crash
 UndercoverToad: forgetting to print an action
 mybk: I have a timeout and I don't think I have any of those reasons 
 mybk: the only think that I added is a lookup table for getPossibleMoves 
 UndercoverToad: any error messages?
 Nerchio: depends on the language but sometimes its good to not to use full 100ms
 mybk: no 
 Nerchio: i use 88 ms for my beam
 mybk: I did try 10ms
 mybk: and I have the same problem 
 mybk: "mybk has not provided an action in time."
 UndercoverToad: no crash report?
 mybk: no
 UndercoverToad: write the input directly to stderr
 UndercoverToad: then test it offline with that input
 Vaurtitoux: petition to set the max timeout to 5ms! NO MORE TREE ENJOYERS!
 mybk: okay thanks I will try that
 UndercoverToad: even with 5ms it's possible to do a bit of searchand CodinGame has problems with random timeouts that would affect all bots
 UndercoverToad: the SDK even defines a minimum thinking time of 50ms per turn
 Marchete: hiding time, euler?
 mybk: UndercoverToad I have no problem in offline, so it's related to CG... 
 UndercoverToad: maybe the last submit was just a fluke Marchete, I haven't changed much
 Marchete: :S
 UndercoverToad: mybk do you have a replay of the timeout, maybe we have an idea what could cause it then
 Nerchio: top20 is pretty brutal
 mybk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554944362">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554944362</a>
 Marchete: that either means the game is assymetric or unreliable
 UndercoverToad: i disabled a feature where i'm uncertain about. maybe it was good after all
 ddreams: the game is certainly asymmetric
 Marchete: it must be that
 UndercoverToad: and wider beam
 Marchete: HS P3 again
 ddreams:  mybk it's likely a crash
 ddreams: "the only think that I added is a lookup table for getPossibleMoves "
 ddreams: make sure you don't go outside the limits here
 UndercoverToad: key not found is what I read here
 UndercoverToad: but should give an error message in the web IDE at least
 UndercoverToad: do you clear that lookup after each turn?
 mybk: no 
 UndercoverToad: if not, you don't have the same state online and offline (testing only 1 turn)
 ddreams: usually I don't get any crash report in c++
 mybk: I am using java 
 mybk: HashMap in java nor limited 
 ddreams: how do you test it offline?
 Nerchio: you can still do map.get(nonExistent).doWhatever()
 Nerchio: boom
 Nerchio: but you should get nullpointer then idk
 mybk: I copied the whole game (24 days) given to me, past it into a file and I am reading from the file rather than from standard input
 mybk: I am testing before a get a value, if the hash exist in the Map  
 mybk: no I did test the whole game 
 mybk: and in offline I added more time to force the problem to appear (1000 ms)
 akagami101: op
 kovi: new candidate VB.NET
 UndercoverToad: that's a resubmit of my #3 bot&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: not even top10 this time
 MSmits: morning
 UndercoverToad: lunchtime, see you
 kovi: randomness 2-7 for mehello MSmits
 MSmits: I went to sleep at 4 am, then woke up at 9 am because of package delivery. Then couldnt sleep again because of contest ideas
 Astrobytes: morning!
 MSmits: now rank 116 though&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: grats!
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 kovi: nice
 aCat: close MSmits
 aCat: Im #121 now ;p
 MSmits: impossible, i am 121 now
 MSmits: now 128
 MSmits: dropping :P
 jrke: so finally MS got an good eval
 jrke: but i didn't lol
 MSmits: I am really stupid this contest. Earlier I spent an hour or two puzzled at brutaltester, until I realized I read the columns for p1 and p2 as wr, instead of rows
 MSmits: mmh this new thingy should give me 90% wr, why doesnt it work on leaderboard&#160;?
 Whatar: Do you got any problem running the game locally? I know get extremely low scores with my bot, 12 or so
 Whatar: *did you get
 jrke: because only you are not on leaderboard MS&#160;;)
 Codechaos: I'm using Java and have weird timeout issues. I save the current time right at the start of the while loop.Then again after the current day is transmitted. Sometimes just this takes more than 200ms so my actual game code doesn't even have a real chance to do much stuff.
 MSmits: mmh no problems, but if you set nearly identical bots against eachother you will get mostly draws
 RoboStac: Codechaos - you need to start timing after the first input (the server starts timing when it sends the input) or you'll include server processing time in your turn
 Whatar: true, the problem is that at the end of the game I get exactly 12 points each bot
 Whatar: if I simulate the game with the same bot against the same bot on the site I get 130-110 or similar scores
 MSmits: Codechaos look at it like this: It's a while loop, so you'll go back to the beginning of it immediately after outputting. So you send output and then immediately starting the timer again, instead of waiting till server is done
 MSmits: wait till at least one 1 is read (so first input_
 MSmits: one line
 MSmits: (wait RoboStac said with more detail)
 MSmits: what... damn my typing sucks
 MSmits: maybe because 5 hr sleep
 MSmits: Whatar you must have a bug somewhere, how do you simulate your games?
 MSmits: maybe confusing turns and days or something
 Codechaos: That makes sense, thank you!
 Whatar: I am not using cg-brutaltester yet, I am just running the refee with two instancees of very similar bots
 Marchete: Smits vs his nemesis game
 Whatar: the two bots run decently online
 MSmits: this is actually a game i should be ok at, but i am messing up a lot, doing stupid sht
 Whatar: but maybe there is a slightly difference in the local game that messes up with my spaghetti code
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: stupid as bugs or stupid as bad ideas
 MSmits: bugs
 Marchete: unit tests
 MSmits: i did do more unit testing than i normally do, just no across the board
 MSmits: some things i tested really well, it's the untested ones...
 Marchete: untested like what?
 MSmits: like nth element
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: ok
 Whatar: the game starts with 2 trees even locally right? I am surfing the source code but I am not experienced with java
 MSmits: well the referee is the referee
 MSmits: so if you take it, you get the same game, supposedly
 Marchete: I haven't used the referee this game
 MSmits: scoring is included
 Marchete: at all
 Whatar: yeah in theory it should be exactly the same, input, outputs, everything
 ddreams: depends on the league, Whatar
 MSmits: at some point you do need to fit some params Marchete
 ddreams: if you don't set the league, you start with tons of trees
 Marchete: fit for openings?
 Whatar: how do I set the league?
 MSmits: for the game, eval parameters
 ddreams: there's a -d option, I don't remember
 Whatar: the -d should be for the seed
 ddreams: I just removed the wood leagues from the code
 Marchete: I'm too stupid for understanding it
 ddreams: ok then :p
 Nerchio: i agree with MSmits i can't imagine doing a search without some local mass games
 Whatar: I can do that I guess
 MSmits: Nerchio in some games it works ok and in this game it works ok too, aslong as your bot has maybe 2 or 3 params
 MSmits: more than that and you need faster testing than a submit will give you
 Nerchio: true i guess almost every search i make has many paramteres :D
 MSmits: yeah
 Nerchio: and well search is supported by other stuff
 Nerchio: which can be changed too
 MSmits: yup
 ddreams: I never understood why when you tell people something they don't know, often they argue against it
 MSmits: that makes no sense ddreams
 ddreams: agreed
 MSmits: they should reply: "knowledge accepted, starting integration..."
 ddreams: exactly, looking forward to meet our AI overlords
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Whatar: than you ddreams, there was a switch for game league and I just removed woods
 ddreams: yw
 MSmits: I remember doing kutulu contest and translating entire java referee to C# to write a sim
 MSmits: never doing that again
 Nerchio: :fearful:
 ddreams: yeah, I was doing that for pacman for the collide resolution stuff
 ddreams: not fun
 MSmits: pro tip, dont use unsigned variables when you are subtracting things
 davilla: unsigned arithmetic can still be checked
 Nerchio: java fixes it for you there is no usigned types
 Nerchio: :joy:
 MSmits: that helps
 alchemsti: "fixes"
 MSmits: a lot of problems are prevented by not using C++&#160;:)
 ddreams: Nerchio what about "char"? :p
 davilla: ddreams look up cognitive dissonance
 davilla: to answer your earlier question
 Nerchio: ddreams yeah.. the only one maybe from primitives but you can't use it with mathemathical operations easily 
 Nerchio: i mean you can but surprises await
 ddreams: davilla yeah, might be an explanation
 Nerchio: i hope i can make a lucky submit to legend in the evening
 Nerchio: but yeah might be difficult
 Chainman: good morning
 MSmits: Nerchio it is possible that whomever is chosen as boss, has &lt; 50% wr against you, even if they are ranked higher
 MSmits: so spam submit will get you, and everyone above you, to legend
 Nerchio: yeah atm breaking to top20 to 'secure' the spot seems difficult
 MSmits: and in any case, you can refit your params, to beat it later
 MSmits: it seems pretty certain you will hit legend before monda
 jrke: or even luckily you can get pushed by spam submits of bots weaker than you
 MSmits: that too
 MSmits: i have gotten to legend before, while asleep
 ddreams: Mr. Smits, the sleeping legend
 jrke: MS i am still not having an eval still my bot is heuristic
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: well tbh, if you dont solve every search bug you have, heuristic is gonna be better
 MSmits: it's hard to get bots to do what you want in a search, for this game
 jrke: yeah i tried many things but..
 Nerchio: i had a search now i try to support it with heuristics and action override sometimes
 MSmits: same
 Nerchio: in case it sees too far into the future for things that dont exist&#160;;)
 Nerchio: "i will be rich if my enemy doesnt plant any trees"
 Nerchio: thats kinda what my search sees sometimes
 MSmits: makes sense
 jrke: my current heuristic performs well in early game good seed planting then it gets bad
 ddreams: not completing enough? completing too much? :p
 MSmits: well the game becomes more unpredictable then and more flexiblity is needed
 jrke: look at this i can't even make out what am i doing wrong
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555005373">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555005373</a>
 actualCoderTrevor: jrke why are you waiting to seed if when seeding is free?
 actualCoderTrevor: I can understand waiting till you have a level 2+ tree but you wait even longer than that
 alchemsti: causes dormancy, want to seed further away, increases seeding cost
 ddreams: too many level3 trees probably
 actualCoderTrevor: I'm just looking at the first seed action
 alchemsti: (but those don't seem to apply, except perhaps dormancy, sorry)
 Noyotens: any typescript guy
 actualCoderTrevor: jrke it happens again around turn 61 - you have no seeds on the board but wait until the next day to plant. Just an idea / observation on how you might be able to improve
 Noyotens: j
 jrke: thanks actualCoderTrevor
 actualCoderTrevor: You're welcome hope it helps&#160;:)
 ddreams: also jrke, having more than 6 level 3 trees is very expensive
 lpellieer: hi guys, do you have any tips to get out of silver&#160;? should i work on a specific algorithm or just stick to heuristics&#160;?
 Nerchio: well having more than 1 tree level 3 is already expensive and you are overpaying :D
 ddreams: you're also growing to level 3 before cutting down another
 dbf: lpellieer it is possible to reach gold without search algo
 MSmits: possibly to reach legend. Depends on how good the heuristics are, right?
 Nerchio: well you need simulation of the future turns but not search itself
 Nerchio: imo
 ddreams: the top 24 guy says he has no search/sim, just a move selector
 MSmits: yeah you can do some loop over future days, but that's not really a search if you're not using some sort of tree of gamestates
 alchemsti: Where did he say that?
 Nerchio: ddreams who?
 ddreams: typescript guy
 alchemsti: I gotta say, I am impressed with that move selector
 lpellieer: ok thanks
 Marchete: what move selector?
 alchemsti: I do think this problem favors time on eval, BUT sometimes there are some time tradeoffs that it seems search can help you make the correct choice
 alchemsti: The one that's getting the person to spot #24
 alchemsti: :D
 jrke: but the thing if you have a size 3 tree not in shadow it gives you 3 sunpoints = 1 score(/3)
 alchemsti: My move selector got my to spot 900
 Marchete: ahhh
 alchemsti: So now I'm trying to move over to a beam type search
 alchemsti: which is why I'm dead last in my league :D 
 Marchete: I'm there too, don't worry
 MSmits: is this the same bot that was 200 ranked early on Marchete?
 MSmits: you said it was heuristic
 MSmits: right?
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: have you tried a search? 
 MSmits: i'm sure you have
 Marchete: I finished the sim yesterday or the day before
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: exact sim
 Marchete: I'd throw some ugly search and eval
 Marchete: and not much more
 Marchete: not gonna lie, I'm terrible at this
 MSmits: well different  contests require different skill
 Marchete: at any contest
 MSmits: this one is particularly heavy on the "watch games and tweak eval"
 lpellieer: you seem like you're doing alright lol
 MSmits: it's relative lpellieer. There are other things on CG where Marchete is the best or at least top  5
 lpellieer: oh okay
 jrke: MS your depth in BS is equal to what turns or day?
 MSmits: it's 30 turns, but my bot takes an extra turn to determine if all states are waiting before moving on to the next day
 MSmits: so i am guessing around 5 days average
 aCat: yeah, got similar Smith
 Marchete: I was targetting 8 turns, :S
 MSmits: cool
 Nerchio: that didnt work with my bot at all idk why
 jrke: gtg bye 
 Nerchio: maybe because low width
 Nerchio: like 700
 MSmits: yeah, I have 2k, but there's so many reasons why high depth may not work
 Marchete: but without enemy prediction a depth=30 must be unreliable
 MSmits: some parts of it are yes
 MSmits: but you are also making choices unrelated to opponent that have to be planned far into the future
 MSmits: like tree placement, so you dont overshadow your own trees
 MSmits: in hypersonic, 40 depth seemed best for me. But calculating to 70 depth gave the same result, it didnt hurt at all
 Marchete: I did depth 12
 MSmits: yeah, so it depends on a lot of things...
 Marchete: 8 bomb time + some reserve for reacting
 Marchete: but 30 on this game, with seeding in place...
 MSmits: it's not actually 30
 Marchete: I can't see it
 Marchete: I'll wait for postmortems
 xk9c: anyone has some tips how to improve my programming skills? im doing clash of code the whole time but i cant solve many only some 
 MSmits: Marchete it's better to look at it in terms of days
 MSmits: in my case it's 4-5 days
 MSmits: the 30 turn is based on the slowest state of each depth level
 Marchete: maybe you are right
 Marchete: depth of days instead of turns
 MSmits: i mean i dont cut off the beam after days, thats a bad idea I think, but it's a better way to discuss depth
 Marchete: after days?
 Marchete: what do you mean?
 MSmits: yeah, i mean calculate all combinations of actions of a whole day
 MSmits: then beaming
 MSmits: that's too much branching i think
 MSmits: need to beam during day too
 Marchete: I'm going to do the simples algo
 Marchete: random stuff
 Marchete: then mutate
 Marchete: keep better
 Marchete: simplest*
 MSmits: that's simple for you
 MSmits: because you know it well&#160;:)
 Marchete: LAHC loop is 9 lines
 Marchete: then some function to do random moves
 Marchete: and some "mutators"
 Marchete: I was thinking like adding a WAIT, replacing by WAIT, swap move n and n+1
 Marchete: etc
 Marchete: then some eval
 Noyotens: any ts guys
 MSmits: could work, beam search is not many lines either though, if you just consider the search
 Marchete: about sungain0 -sungain1 -suncost0 + rollouttoEnd
 MSmits: no teamspeak sorry
 MSmits: we have discord
 Marchete: I was also thinking about reusing my heuristic functions
 Noyotens: ok :cry:
 Marchete: to do "clever" selection at random
 MSmits: i was kidding, i assumed you meant typescript... you were actually asking about teamspeak&#160;!?
 Noyotens: no
 MSmits: oh ok :P
 MSmits: yes there's typescript submits
 Noyotens: i have ques
 MSmits: you can search language on leaderboard
 MSmits: they migth not be online
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555025503">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555025503</a>
 Noyotens: i want win plz help me
 ddreams: did you try the true and tried general strategy to win?
 ddreams: simple: git gud
 MSmits: Noyotens frame 15, dont place seed next to your own tree, unless there arent many other options
 Whatar: You get to many shadoiws from enemy trees I think
 Whatar: and also what ddreams sayd is true
 ddreams: euler seem to often place a seed right next to his own tree
 Whatar: you also get shadows from you own trees
 ddreams: can't figure out why, but he's winning
 MSmits: not in early game i bet
 MSmits: you mean mid/late game?
 ddreams: early
 MSmits: thats odd
 MSmits: but his bot may just be superior in other ways
 Noyotens: i want try new strategy to win
 ddreams: round 5
 alchemsti: If it's short enough it doesn't hurt, and it blocks the enemy 
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555029302">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555029302</a>
 alchemsti: From planting a shade-thrower
 ddreams: I'd expect him to plant at index 9
 Nerchio: yeah some kind of seed optimization is what i want to try
 Nerchio: my search does it well but maybe it can be done better
 ddreams: not 11
 MSmits: ddreams his only other option was  24 from that tree
 Noyotens: how u cheek if the tree is inline or not
 MSmits: and its on the edge
 MSmits: oh and shaded
 VizGhar: hey MSmits nice to see you&#160;:)
 MSmits: so he has no options
 MSmits: hi VizGhar!
 alchemsti: I agree the seed at 11 looks odd
 MSmits: yeah but where should he have dropped the seed?
 ddreams: 24 looks nicer
 VizGhar: been waiting for you whole week&#160;:) heading to legend?
 ddreams: bbl lunch
 MSmits: ddreams 24 is shaded by big tree
 MSmits: it's 3 hexes away
 MSmits: so there are no real options
 MSmits: VizGhar not sure, i hope to make it before monday
 MSmits: probably not before it opens unless a miracle happens
 MSmits: best rank so far was 130
 VizGhar: you mean during other contests?
 MSmits: no, then it's 2. I mean this one
 VizGhar: wonder how many players make it to legend during contests... any historical data?
 MSmits: 70-120 i think
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: sometimes lower even i think
 MSmits: maybe thats between 1 st.dev
 MSmits: usually it opens at 10 or 15 contestants
 Cjx_1: i had heard only as few as 15-20. Maybe thats just those who instantly get brought up?
 Nerchio: i have a feeling this time theres going to be a lot of people
 Cjx_1: ah
 MSmits: then someone lower than the boss, happens to have a &gt;50% wr and pushes a whole bunch to legend
 Zandy156: isn't it based on the total number in gold at first?
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555036872">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555036872</a>
 MSmits: hmm not sure, it's always quite low though
 Noyotens: guys ur the best :cry:
 MSmits: gj Noyotens
 Noyotens: MSmits thank from the heart
 MSmits: that's the best thank&#160;:)
 Nerchio: its kinda disappointing to promote in leagues without fighting the boss haha
 MSmits: yeah, it's quite satisfying to fight boss and win
 Noyotens: i am coming to gold YAAAAAAAAY
 MSmits: except when you fail and contest ends, then it's very frustrating
 Noyotens: MSmits YEAH
 Zandy156: what's your legend rate MSmits? do you try for most contests?
 VizGhar: It's so awesome to see early game improve itself just by changing tree to have nodes that represents DAY instead of TURN
 VizGhar: but I'm timeouting right now. since I always let whole layer of tree be expanded
 VizGhar: which is obviously dumb
 MSmits: Zandy156 so far every time i took a serious swipe at legend i got in there
 MSmits: some contests i gave up after a few days though, time issues and such
 MSmits: then it;s probably silver or something
 MSmits: i dont smurf so i have some abysmal contest results in my list&#160;:)
 MSmits: you can check in people's profile
 VizGhar: what is smurfing btw?
 MSmits: using a different account, to start the contest
 MSmits: if you fail, dont participate with real account
 VizGhar: ah... just so somebody cant see you being too low in some contest? that seems weird...
 jrke: i don;t think someone smurfs
 VizGhar: not smurfing can actualy result in dropping in overall laderboard right?
 jrke: maybe rare
 VizGhar: all moderators :D since their chat is frozen
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: not smurfing wont drop your rank
 MSmits: i mean smurfing
 VizGhar: if you submit poor code then it does right?
 MSmits: bad rank &gt;= no rank
 Michael_Howard: Yeah, smurfing drops your rank.
 RoboStac: only your top 3 contests count for global ranking 
 VizGhar: oh really MSmits didn't know that
 MSmits: that's no longer true is it RoboStac?
 Michael_Howard: Even a low bronze would get you a few points.
 MSmits: isn't it last 10 contests or something, with decay?
 RoboStac: it is - if you check the profile only 3 have *'s on them
 MSmits: ok, so out of the last 10 contests, it keeps your best 3 with decay?
 RoboStac: the only change was decay was added so people who did well 5 years ago didn't stay top
 MSmits: ahh ok
 DomiKo: contest is worth max 10K - 500 * number of contest after that one
 MSmits: so anyways, no reason to smurf, unless you're afraid to have a rank 900 in there between the 5's and 3's 
 Marchete: or bot hiding
 MSmits: or that
 RoboStac: it's not even last 10 - you can still have a really old contest as your best, but the decay makes it unlikely
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: yeah i have old contests as my best for sure
 MSmits: my results were crap last 2 years, mostly
 RoboStac: your best 3 are spring2020, OOC and ice/fire
 MSmits: oh, wow
 MSmits: thats not old
 MSmits: so my early top 10 results dont matter anymore&#160;:(
 MSmits: i guess your win at code royale doesnt either
 MSmits: bit sad
 DomiKo: Xmas is worth 6.5K only 
 Marchete: 3 top1 from 3 years ago == 1 top1 this year
 RoboStac: yeah, my top 3 are spring/utg/pikapcha
 MSmits: ohh yeah the puzzle contest, you did great there
 Marchete: wait do you have top3? :D
 MSmits: top 3 contests, not top 3 ranked
 Marchete: jk
 MSmits: well ranked too :P
 Marchete: you guys are getting paid meme
 MSmits: huh
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2vODYm3cyI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2vODYm3cyI</a>
 Marchete: you all talk about top10, top3, legend
 Marchete: I barely reach top 50 :D
 DomiKo: :joy:
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: sorry about that :P
 UndercoverToad: the global contest leaderboard is useless, I only care about the leaderboards for each individual contest
 Zandy156: dang my 3 best were spring 2020 ooc and ice/fire as well
 UndercoverToad: OoC, spring 2020, fall 2020a 4th place at Ice and Fire doesn't matter anymore
 MSmits: i sprinted ice and fire starting wednesday after grading exams. Not my highest rank, but proudes achievement&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: :D
 UndercoverToad: i have a hard time imagining you coding in a rush
 MSmits: yeah, it was an exception
 MSmits: it helped that I kind of liked the game
 Astrobytes: Post-mortem: Yeah I didn't have much time so I wrote my bot on the back of my hand whilst on the train home then telephoned my wife and dictated it to her as she typed it out. Then I was legend.
 MSmits: with the chaining of actions and such
 RoboStac: I did badly on ice and fire, didn't make legend&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: i still remember hashcode where you thought about bitboard encoding for a 4h contest
 Astrobytes: Didn't you miss part of that one robo?
 MSmits: did you really fail though? Wasnt lack of time robo?
 RoboStac: I think I was away the last weekend, but I put some effort into trying to have a decent bot
 UndercoverToad: a legend without robo doesn't feel like a real legend league
 RoboStac: I've usually managed to get into legend as it opens
 MSmits: UndercoverToad I am both slow and bad at cooperative coding, I liked watching you guys go at it though
 UndercoverToad: you left kutulu early too and almost got top20
 RoboStac: now I just need to pretend I left this one on wednesday and didn't just get stuck trying to improve it&#160;:(
 MSmits: 10th out of 7k is like 3 out of 2k
 UndercoverToad: even submit results feel random again
 Marchete: maybe not smits
 Marchete: multi with 100 people are damn hard at top10 too
 UndercoverToad: there are many new users. but on average I think they are less skilled/trained than CG veterans
 MSmits: no, but then it could be either better or worse
 RoboStac: there are quite a few new names in the top20 though
 MSmits: could also be we drew from a source of good players, it only needs to be a few
 UndercoverToad: just not the CG way of thinking how to squeeze the bot logic in the very generous 100ms
 UndercoverToad: some new names, yes. but not scaling linear to the increase of the total player count
 MSmits: in any case it's not easy to compare your current achievement with a 7k contest to one with a 2k contest. I'd say rank 10 is still pretty nice&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: the Japanese section isn't new to contests, just relatively new on CG
 UndercoverToad: ok, we can agree on that statement MSmits
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hi struct
 RoboStac: hi
 its.Arsh: hey, is there any in-built method in java to convert the hexdecimal to decimal?
 resty-daze: parseInt("abc", 16)&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: a*16*16+b*16+c
 UndercoverToad: a=10, b=11, c=12
 UndercoverToad: a hexadecimal number
 UndercoverToad: 0xabc
 alchemsti: I know it's too early for a post-mortem
 alchemsti: But I am somewhat disappointed by this contest (and/or with myself for this contest)
 UndercoverToad: and i just wrote random stuff without reading anything but the last message
 alchemsti: I guess when I hear of people's cool evals I may feel different
 alchemsti: But currently it feels ... somehow arbitrary.
 alchemsti: I think I'm just a bit frustrated with slow progress
 kovi: i like global contest leaderboard as it is ...
 UndercoverToad: arbitrary or arborary :thinking:
 alchemsti: :D
 Astrobytes: haha
 Zandy156: Hey, how come we don't get to make our trees fight rock paper scissors style?
 alchemsti: I guess it feels like to be successful with my eval form, I would have needed to tune a ton a factors (mostly around time decay)
 Astrobytes: Trees don't fight.
 alchemsti: THEY FIGHT FOR LIGHT!
 Astrobytes: I suppose they gotta fight for the light to party.
 Zandy156: but they don't fight, they sit there lol
 Astrobytes: They play the slow game. Creeping.
 UndercoverToad: my eval is just counting suns, avoiding to shadow myself and a reward for keeping trees and not selling them for quick points
 UndercoverToad: whenever I try to make the eval more complicated, it gets worse
 Marchete: keeping trees until some day*
 Marchete: no?
 UndercoverToad: just keeping
 Marchete: ahh
 UndercoverToad: and evaluate again the next day
 UndercoverToad: the incentive to keep decreases over time
 alchemsti: UndercoverToad interesting -- I'm fairly far along in a re-write, moving to beam search, where I'm just implementing the actual multi-day / beam part. My eval was like yours
 ddreams: what's your incentive for cutting trees then?
 VizGhar: those vectors are slow as hell
 UndercoverToad: maybe i should make it dependent on the game score
 Chainman: why is it that if you attempt an illegal move it ends your turn?  I wish it didn't do that. 
 alchemsti: But SEEDing seemed so awful without a bit more of an eval (I know, I guess search will find which seeds grow well)
 alchemsti: that now I'm spending time on that
 alchemsti: Chainman -- otherwise you could do sneaky stalling techniques
 Marchete: incentive on cutting can be to allow more cycles, seed-&gt;grow-&gt;etc
 ddreams: Chainman you'd prefer a crash?
 Marchete: cost management
 Chainman: no, I'd prefer it to continue with my precomputed graph lol. 
 alchemsti: e.g. wait for your opponent to WAIT and then do 5 quick harvests
 UndercoverToad: oh, i have a bonus for keeping trees that also a function of the number of trees of that size
 alchemsti: but penalizes having too many, right?
 UndercoverToad: not penalizing. just less rewarding
 Marchete: yeah, an array for size[] bonus malus
 UndercoverToad: and I get a reward (score points) for chopping
 ddreams: UndercoverToad but what gives the incentive to actually cut trees?
 ddreams: right
 Marchete: too many trees of the same size =&gt; costly
 ddreams: but why would your bot cut trees early?
 ddreams: instead of waiting to the end
 Chainman: Are you guys at top of the leaderboard, not using self-play to find the params?
 Chainman: But still manually entering them?
 Marchete: imagine your next turn the enemy will shadow your tree3
 Marchete: maybe you prefer to cut it and start a new cycle
 UndercoverToad: somehow offline testing didn't really help me this time
 UndercoverToad: submit is my test
 VizGhar: ddreams you might cut lvl3 tree if next 3 turns will be shadowed
 Marchete: exactly
 UndercoverToad: even got renamed to "test in arena"
 VizGhar: by that time you can grow brand new tree&#160;:)
 Marchete: shadowed and maybe that tree shadow others of your own trees
 Marchete: let the eval decide
 ddreams: well, I'm playing vs Euler often, and he's definitely cutting trees that does not get shadowed any time soon
 Marchete: he probably doesn't know
 actualCoderTrevor: I really wish I'd made an offline testing. Being able to replay the same game from both positions alone would help me out a lot. Right now it's hard to now if my bot's improved until I submit.
 actualCoderTrevor: *to know
 Marchete: he probably have a bunch of variables and weights
 Marchete: and the best weights with more wins are kept
 Zandy156: three reasons to cut a tree early, shade, too many large trees, bonus nutrients points
 Zandy156: also maybe not enough places left to plant new trees
 ddreams: do you intend to put your seed at 11 and not 24 here in round 5, UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555029302">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555029302</a>
 ddreams: just seems weird to shade yourself
 ddreams: actualCoderTrevor you can do that with brutaltester, you don't need to code anything yourself
 UndercoverToad: let me see
 Marchete: Miyazaboss?
 ddreams: oh, a gold boss
 UndercoverToad: really?
 actualCoderTrevor: Thanks ddreams I'll check that out
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555075803">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555075803</a>
 ddreams: MiyazaBoss
 UndercoverToad: indeed
 Marchete: quick, agent ID euler :D
 UndercoverToad: a python gold boss
 Marchete: weird
 UndercoverToad: that must be low, there is no high python&#160;:(
 Marchete: 33th
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh did that boss just show up or am I just noticing it?
 UndercoverToad: CG disappointing me agaoin
 Marchete: maybe they are just testing
 UndercoverToad: again
 Marchete: damn elitists
 UndercoverToad: let's stalk #fr
 Astrobytes: :salt:
 Marchete: let me in, let me iiiin!
 dbdr: SophiaLegacy then?
 ddreams: appears to be a big legend then
 ddreams: I'm beating it and I'm 170
 MSmits: oh, gold opened early
 Marchete: they must be testing it
 UndercoverToad: gold opened 2 days ago
 MSmits: err i mean legend :p
 Astrobytes: get some sleep ffs MSmits :P
 dbdr: wait, why is that boss in my ide?
 VizGhar: at least boss appeared
 VizGhar: Those better than the Boss will be promoted to Legend League
 MSmits: no sleep till legend&#160;!
 Marchete: why boss calc?
 Marchete: not a direct promotion?
 Chainman: Is legend open already?
 Marchete: they want to make sure it's a good bot
 MSmits: good idea
 ddreams: I bet it's going to change
 ddreams: this one is too easy
 UndercoverToad: ddreams the game you shared is an IDE match. I can't see my error stream to tell you more about what I was thinking there. but cell 24 is in like with cell 1
 ddreams: ah, right
 UndercoverToad: and the self-shading on day 5 is on a seed =&gt; 0 sun gain in anyways
 ddreams: that's even what msmits said, I just didn't understand it
 MSmits: yeah, every option is shaded in some way
 UndercoverToad: such a shady game
 MSmits: very shady
 ddreams: don't you guys be putting shade on this game
 Marchete: that's tree
 MSmits: moar puns
 Marchete: I seed
 Astrobytes: at least we got to the root of the issue
 ddreams: can't spring puns on you on request
 VizGhar: cut it off
 Astrobytes: conversation seems to have branched off somewhat
 ddreams: nah, this game is growing on me
 Marchete: :sunny::evergreen_tree::new_moon::herb:
 MSmits: growing weed under a tree?
 Astrobytes: maybe fall contest will be ganja farming or something
 UndercoverToad: boss at 186 right now
 UndercoverToad: what are they testing?
 Astrobytes: your patience?
 RoboStac: should get higher, the bot it's copied from is #57
 ddreams: see you all in legend :p
 RoboStac: but even so thats a big legend
 VizGhar:   Even I feel like i can stand a chance
 MSmits: gonna be 200-300 before monday
 jke: how do you know who it was copied from?
 dbdr: :scream:
 RoboStac: debug messages are fairly distinctive
 Clagus: :D
 MSmits: and robo keeps tabs on everyone
 AceTea: il est quelle place le bot gold&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: to #fr you go
 UndercoverToad: VizGhar 02:33PM
 ddreams: the idea of legend is to keep VizGhar out
 Astrobytes: Maybe it'll be renamed The Fun League
 ddreams: that's not a nice thing to say, toad
 ddreams: underhanded insult
 VizGhar:   don't worry ddreams, i didn't get it :D
 dbdr: there's actually a boss in the lb?? :o
 ddreams: yes, it's Bernard_Lowe
 UndercoverToad: but you have to scroll a lot to find it
 UndercoverToad: 141 at the moment
 AceTea: under which name&#160;?
 AceTea: I really don'T see it in the leaderboard
 RoboStac: just set leaderboard to show computing (hast to be the ide leaderboard)
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/YPSdbZ.jpg">https://snipboard.io/YPSdbZ.jpg</a>

 ddreams: gj kovi&#160;:)
 Chainman: 436 ms to create graph with 61 nodes, I'm done lol
 UndercoverToad: finished at 100
 kovi: legend now?
 struct: I really need to make an eval
 dbdr:&#160;???
 struct: its stil the eval from testing
 dbf: yes, promotion is started
 struct: already?
 struct: what
 UndercoverToad: you'll probably drift without an eval struct
 ddreams: 55 in legend so far
 dbdr: I think it's by mistake again
 ddreams: 70 :p
 aCat: something is strange
 Nerchio: wait what
 Nerchio: o.O
 ddreams: 95
 UndercoverToad: didn't look like a mistake, that boss was computing for 10 minutes
 MSmits: maybe they went for coffee
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: I was expecting the promotion to be later
 ZarthaxX: wtf early legend???
 MSmits: same
 struct: I wanted to improve eval before it
 ZarthaxX: what is this
 aCat: and ore cutoff
 MSmits: ore?
 aCat: *more
 MSmits: wrong game
 ZarthaxX: so 100 cut off
 MSmits: oh ok
 UndercoverToad: that was the easiest legend since CSB multiplayer
 ZarthaxX: damnnn
 ZarthaxX: is this a bug or true legend?
 UndercoverToad: it's true after all, CG is getting more and move inclusive
 dbdr: a bug I'd say
 struct: from 20 on last contest to 100 on this
 Chainman: It said legend on 05/16/2021 yesterday.
 UndercoverToad: legend used to be an achievement
 UndercoverToad: Chainman when did you open the tab?
 UndercoverToad: 2 days ago?
 aCat: damn, sadly i ddidnt have few more hs to code
 Chainman: probably just 1-2 days
 struct: ok
 struct: Legend or delete
 ZarthaxX: i thought the same UndercoverToad
 struct: with this big of a league there is no excuse
 ZarthaxX: i mean based on number of participants its ok to promote more people
 ZarthaxX: encouaring that its possible
 UndercoverToad: others reported wrong dates as well Chainman. and they all had the tab open for at least a day
 struct: My issue is not the date but the hour
 Chainman: oh
 struct: usually is at 5-6pm
 Zandy156: didn't last spring challenge stat with like 50 in legend?
 struct: it started with 20
 UndercoverToad: maybe we'll read a blog post after the contest, where happy users get quoted how they managed to beat the final boss
 Nerchio: struct maybe they want to go home faster today :D
 ZarthaxX: its friday mah bois
 Astrobytes: lol Toad
 Astrobytes: The Happy Happy Joy Joy League
 Gabbek: Hello dear friends!&#160;:)
 Gabbek: How's the day going?
 ZarthaxX: excellent
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad true that haha
 Astrobytes: Hi Gabbek :wave:
 Gabbek: Good day Astro!
 UndercoverToad: it's going legendary
 gmessier: euler so we should now have a SuperLegend league
 MSmits: Mythic league
 dbdr: ^
 gmessier: Only for the small Gods circle
 UndercoverToad: not going to happen, CG has a hard time putting anything above legend. was discussed for CSB already
 MSmits: with bossW00t heading up legend league
 dbdr: league -1
 dbdr: legend is 0
 UndercoverToad: dbdr when legend? :smirk:
 dbdr: :P
 UndercoverToad: you submitted at the wrong time
 gmessier: So maybe it will be better to add on the other side and keep the old ratios
 gmessier: The current Bronze is almost a Wood 1 :D
 Gabbek: My first gold league in contest, so happy :D
 dbf: congrats, Gabbek
 Gabbek: thank you!
 aCat: now go legend&#160;;-)
 Meatly_Wheatly: no
 Meatly_Wheatly: stop 
 Nerchio: its probably possible to get legend with 200 lines of code
 Chainman: 368 nodes in 910 ms for first turn hahah
 no-cat: idk what going on 
 no-cat: i cant beat the first code
 no-cat: i think im broke
 no-cat: the practise
 UndercoverToad: the bork beetle got you
 no-cat: idk
 Chainman: wow improved lots of time by going to iterative as opposed to recursion for creating my graph.
 no-cat: the teacher did
 Chainman: went from 400-500 -&gt; 100 ms for same number nodes.
 Chainman: but still too slow. 
 no-cat: what does that mean
 Meatly_Wheatly: yea i know its probably the connective interface of the javascript and mc 
 no-cat: yea hthat what i thogt\
 Meatly_Wheatly: this is all easy work tho
 linjoehan: So how do I get to gold? NOTE: I'm still in wood
 no-cat: i codeded minceratf on tortila it dintd worc
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ghost-in-the-cell/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ghost-in-the-cell/leaderboard</a>ghost in the cell also had a huge legend league (223 players)
 Meatly_Wheatly: i know im in 1st grade but this is easy
 Nerchio: so this is not a bug with legend yeah?
 no-cat: IM NO GOOD at THis
 Meatly_Wheatly: my other friend is like 2 and he already in champin
 Gabbek: well about 100-120 legend atm
 UndercoverToad: unlikely, CG getting inclusive now and pleasing casual players
 Gabbek: sounds about right
 XHelp: can I somehow fetch the engine for java, so I can run my algo locally?
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad but the time for legend is weird
 ZarthaxX: has this happened before? mhm
 Meatly_Wheatly: kick me plz this is borig
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it has. Don't remember which contest
 UndercoverToad: GitC was early legend too, Friday morning
 ZarthaxX: also dbdr is there a gold boss?? i dont see any in your last battles
 Meatly_Wheatly: kick me
 Meatly_Wheatly: kickme 
 ZarthaxX: oh nvm then toad
 Meatly_Wheatly: kickme
 Meatly_Wheatly: kick me
 Meatly_Wheatly: kick me
 UndercoverToad: yesterday was a public holiday for France (or most of Europe for the matter)
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: that may expplain it
 reCurse: 100 legend :rofl:
 UndercoverToad: i guess they are pulling a short day today
 SamPlamondo: haa u guys suck i coded byraft
 UndercoverToad: more work for you Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: It's getting ridiculous
 UndercoverToad: the spammers or legend?
 Astrobytes: haha, both
 ZarthaxX: is there a gold boss?
 ZarthaxX: i dont see it on last battles from people
 Gabbek: how many people used to enter legend in the past? (quite new to contests)
 ZarthaxX: 20
 ZarthaxX: at the start
 reCurse: Like 10 at opening, 100 or so at end
 reCurse: Now it's 100 at start...
 ZarthaxX: :D
 reCurse: Used to mean something
 Gabbek: oh :O
 ZarthaxX: meme now&#160;:(
 Chainman: :nerd: Maybe I am legend now 
 reCurse: Wouldn't be surprised to see 350 legend at end
 aCat: yeah seems... weird
 UndercoverToad: ZarthaxX there's your boss replay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555109272">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555109272</a>
 UndercoverToad: 50.37 points
 Chainman: What's a good amount of nodes to have in my graph?
 Astrobytes: 42
 reCurse: Huge league with crippled batches, this isn't cool
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad thanks
 Chainman: :joy:
 ZarthaxX: oh true, why didnt they move players to legend this time :P
 gmessier: Difficult to keep "casual" players if they can't have a chance to go further than bronze. But, not challenging for "hardcore" players if it's to easy to reach high leagues... 
 UndercoverToad: Chainman I can show you my numbers for comparison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555110976">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555110976</a>it's in my message buggle
 UndercoverToad: bubble
 Astrobytes: buggle sounds far better
 reCurse: gmessier: Maybe I need to explain further
 reCurse: Once you're in the top 20 or so, getting feedback from games is hugely important
 ZarthaxX: astroooooooo
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 aCat: there should be more lagues~~
 aCat: !!
 reCurse: You used to be able to run batches, so automate the IDE to play matches and get relevant usable results for you
 reCurse: They crippled that
 reCurse: So now all you have left are submits
 Astrobytes: ZarthhhhaxX :kissing_heart:
 reCurse: But in huge leagues, you get even less relevant games
 ZarthaxX: howdy Astrobytes
 reCurse: And more submits from people in legend with more games means very slow results
 gmessier: Yeah,  I just say that I guess they try to find the compromise, but it's difficult.
 reCurse: In a nutshell, the competition is severely damage
 ZarthaxX: true&#160;:(
 reCurse: d
 reCurse: Not that anyone cares I guess
 aCat: all legend recomputes now
 aCat: hahaha ;p
 struct: its not fair for the competitive people
 Nerchio: legend here i come
 Chainman: really Toad, n&gt;5k in t=12ms :0
 Queuebee: wow legend is huge
 Chainman: and that is only depth=3 though
 annaproxy: Omg 
 delineate: I think the issue started because the wood bosses were too easy, very few people in wood now compared with past contests. I'm guessing they take the top X% as a cutoff for each new league. I noticed silver was larger than normal when it was started, same issue with gold, etc.
 gmessier: I think it could be a good option to have Wood 3, Wood 2, Wood 1 (but Wood 1 is the final rules) and you open bronze after a couple of days.
 UndercoverToad: others claim far more simulations in the same time
 LLG: I made the most important improvement to my bot around this time yesterday
 LLG: I made it rickroll the opponent
 UndercoverToad: depth=3 means 3 days, not 3 actions in my counting
 Gabbek: delineate seems to be the case, yes
 reCurse: delineate: They always made an exception for legend
 reCurse: Open with very few
 Chainman: ohh, that makes mor esense
 Chainman: sense
 reCurse: Not anymore it seems
 Chainman: And the nodes are computed for the entire day
 aangairbender: wtf I am in legend
 Chainman: or 5k nodes created in 12 ms
 reCurse: Can't remember the last time a positive change was made&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: i thought the same aangairbender
 linjoehan: So is wood just second action in the list?
 UndercoverToad: we are equally shocked aangairbender
 reCurse: Oh, allowing console to resize I guess...
 ZarthaxX: :clap:
 Cjx_1: destined to unite the tribes
 Astrobytes: I mean, the clue is in the name of the league...
 Cjx_1: grats dood
 aangairbender: first legend in life during contest, ok I'll take it
 RoboStac: the boss submit ended quite a bit lower than the bot it was copied from so it's possible they only intended to increase it to 50-60 (which would probably match percentage wise on the older 2000 people contests)
 reCurse: But legend has never been about&#160;%
 aCat: linjoehan yes
 ZarthaxX: oh...
 reCurse: At least it used not to be
 UndercoverToad: Chainman that's generating 5k valid moves and scoring the outcome of each
 reCurse: It was aiming to end with top 100 or so
 reCurse: Regardless of participants
 reCurse: Because of rerun etc
 MSmits: depending on the game, a leaderboard can be very volatile. That means that even when you cut it off at 15, you can soon have 50. In this case it was far worse
 UndercoverToad: rerun has been min(legend size, 100) for some contests already
 Saelyos: That's really disapointing&#160;:/
 Nerchio: so do we know whos boss it is
 linjoehan: and done now I wait to get to bronze then the real game starts
 Astrobytes: I have no idea why they just didn't move the top n and recomputed instead
 Chainman: interesting
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad what? when
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes same :P
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555081682">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555081682</a> &lt;-- probable boss based on debug
 Chainman: Mine is way to complex then, I did too much 
 UndercoverToad: since BotG I think, they only put top 100 in the rerun and skipped the 2 or 3 remaining bots
 gmessier: It's difficult to fix a hard limit when your gate is a specific bot. If you have more "good" players, you will have more people in the league.However this time the bosses are too easy.
 reCurse: I don't think the best bots are a percentage
 UndercoverToad: robo but the boss doesn't say "sleep". maybe they took an older version of that bot (just guessing)
 reCurse: Add 100 million players to chess, should there be a lot more GMs?
 reCurse: Anyway, pointless
 gmessier: So you should not use a bot boss to set the league. Otherwise, the more bots are better than the boss, the more go in legend.
 RoboStac: there would be a load more GM's if that happened as the cutoff is elo based 
 avdg: probably more logarithmic
 UndercoverToad: a bot is a reasonable gatekeeper, setting same difficulty level for everyone to promote
 gmessier: If 100 players don't submit their best bot and than when the legend league opens they all submit them. They may all go in the legend.
 LLG: I just want Default to be my gatekeeper 
 MSmits: as long as it is strong enough and not beaten by some RPS effect
 linjoehan: Actually if only under9's are allowed to play chess there would be a ton of U9s with a 2800 rating
 reCurse: My point was getting GM is extremely difficult, but if you make it&#160;% based, then a lot of people who would have never qualified as GM in their lives would have automatically gotten it
 reCurse: During the chess popularity influx
 reCurse: So using&#160;% for top makes no sense
 MSmits: depends on the distribution of the influx
 UndercoverToad: there are always a few hiders that promote after the boss appears, that's normal. but with a higher ranked boss the league would still be smaller, no matter how many are hiding
 MSmits: if it happens gradually, it's np
 reCurse: You won't get GMs as influx, come on
 linjoehan: though GM is not&#160;% only is it?
 MSmits: no, not with a sudden influx
 reCurse: It takes years of dedication and hard work
 MSmits: but thats different from CG
 MSmits: you could have an influx of high qualirt
 MSmits: quality
 reCurse: I don't believe a word of that
 RoboStac: if all the people from the influx joined FIDE competitions you would get more gm's though - elo gets inflated with more players
 gmessier: I don't know how they "select" the bosses
 ddreams: GM title isn't elo based though
 linjoehan: yeah GM is not just ELO based
 MSmits: gmessier bot strength, calculation time used (preferred heuristic bosses)
 gmessier: They use a "player" for the bosses or they create them?
 MSmits: player
 MSmits: except wood
 MSmits: they create those
 Astrobytes: From wood.
 gmessier: That's the problem then. They choose a bots too weak this time
 MSmits: exactly
 linjoehan: Is a bot abe to see who he is playing?
 UndercoverToad: no linjoehan
 MSmits: well, unless you hardcode a way to detect playstyles
 UndercoverToad: that would make abuse easy
 struct: not even the sdk knows
 UndercoverToad: which is reasonable
 struct: yeah
 UndercoverToad: I can change my nickname and the replays will show the new name
 linjoehan: So bronze is last rule change?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 ddreams: I'm surprised that dbdr and Nerchio is still in gold
 ddreams: waiting for 100% I guess
 VizGhar: ++
 dbdr: yes
 UndercoverToad: dbdr is destroying the league right now
 RoboStac: yeah, with the legend bots being resubmitted games aren't going fast
 UndercoverToad: 8 points above the boss
 dbdr: :innocent:
 Nerchio: yeah i was trying to fix my bot for like 7pm legend league
 dbdr: I have a stronger bot too, maybe I should resub now
 Nerchio: messed it up and had to rollback now
 Nerchio: when i saw legend open :joy:
 Nerchio: i kinda expected this legend league to be easy though not sure why
 UndercoverToad: MC at top gold. that's the one who created the Langton's Ant multiplayer
 Astrobytes: Ah, the elusive MC
 KalamariKing: anyone wanna look something over for me
 KalamariKing: how do I keep losing
 KalamariKing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555020308">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555020308</a>
 ddreams: well, you get a lower score than your opponent
 ddreams: that's bad
 KalamariKing: they had 0
 KalamariKing: I had like 130
 KalamariKing: That's a win
 UndercoverToad: horrible seed right there
 UndercoverToad: twice in a row
 struct: you seed eraly
 struct: early*
 Astrobytes: You're timing out 
 ddreams: yeah, timeout or a crash
 Astrobytes: scroll to the end
 KalamariKing: Oh ok thanks
 KalamariKing: That makes sense
 UndercoverToad: you seed at short range. and you seed while having another seed on the board
 struct: grow both trees before seeding
 Nerchio: you probably are trying to sell non existing tree or something
 KalamariKing: y'all know its a beginner strat right
 KalamariKing: its nothing complex
 KalamariKing: so thanks for the tips
 Astrobytes: just re-check your logic
 KalamariKing: that seed one is nice, thanks euler
 JSboss: nerchio naked shorting&#160;??
 JSboss:&#160;:)
 MSmits: why are we discussing Nerchio's fashion sense
 Nerchio: lol kind of
 ddreams: let's see if this 65.63% self play win takes me to legend then
 MSmits: I have 80% all the time and then it does nothing =/
 dbdr: MSmits you misread it&#160;;)
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002</a>
 ntsd: hey I don't understand coord in the source code
 ddreams: do you play both sides though?
 MSmits: i did
 dbdr: it's 20&amp;
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002</a>
 MSmits: but it's still true now :P
 dbdr: 20%
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 KalamariKing: Yep, timeout, thanks all
 MSmits: i guess it depends on what you change
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002</a>
 LLG: made it further than last contest
 none_: Is there bot that cuts of legend league? Or is is based purely on ranking (like first 104)? I would like to see how it plays, but all I see is both called Default, which is rubbish...
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555132002</a>
 MSmits: small param change is hard to test with self-play
 dbdr: no first ten matches in legend?
 LLG: was low gold, now high gold, legend looks very possible if I don't slack off on weekends
 Astrobytes: I know KalamariKing: I saw it on your replay
 ntsd: what is coords (x, y, z) of cell index 1, 2, 3
 struct: the cuttof is rand()
 KalamariKing: quick question what's radix
 KalamariKing: its base right
 ddreams: none_: MiyazaBoss
 Astrobytes: base
 KalamariKing: oh you're joking, the only reason its timing out is because I used byte instead of short and it was too large
 KalamariKing: Ok thanks all
 jrke: damn 104 in legend
 jrke: what was the opening of legend?
 UndercoverToad: byte to store the score?
 UndercoverToad: yes jrke&#160;:(
 Gabbek: it was about 95 players jrke, the same as it is now&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: 95 + a few with pending submits that finished now
 ddreams: *sad elite player noises*
 UndercoverToad: boss was between 103 and 104 when I got promoted
 Uljahn: ^
 UndercoverToad: i'm not an elite player. I'm a lvl3 noob
 jrke: they should have opened for 15 only opening of silver and gold can vary like there prices do in real market but legends are always legends so i think they should have gone for 15-20
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 struct: maybe I can just wait instead of coding the eval
 KalamariKing: Now that that's fixedLet's see how high I can get
 ddreams: gl squiddie
 KalamariKing: first 10, all wins
 KalamariKing: Wow these are slow
 Nerchio: now i started getting games vs the boss
 Astrobytes: Drugs are not the answer KalamariKing :P
 Nerchio: its 51.5 points now
 Nerchio: it was 50 before :D
 UndercoverToad: I remember last Sunday Marchete asked dbdr it his bot was legend level already. Both dbdr and me answered with no
 UndercoverToad: I admit fault here
 none_: well, there goes my motivation... I was reworking my solution, but right now I guess I am satisfied with rank 50... :D
 UndercoverToad: 50 is 200 at the end
 dbdr: we couldn't have known UndercoverToad
 ddreams: oops, submitted with testing timeout of 60ms
 ddreams: still way better than old bot
 none_: well, if it's still based on bot position, I should be fine... :D
 KalamariKing: oh we climbin
 KalamariKing: we climbin bois
 Cjx_1: bout to hit gold this afternoon with nothing but if else loops, arrays, and a whole lotta moxie :P
 jrke: they took python3 as a boss so maybe its heuristic
 KalamariKing: oh what do the python3 games look like
 Astrobytes: Lots of snakes and stuff
 UndercoverToad: snakes and ladders
 KalamariKing: wdym snakes
 ddreams: check out pygame
 aangairbender: turtles battle
 KalamariKing: snakes of trees
 Cjx_1: mimics of the high level sims mostly rofl
 UndercoverToad: snake = python
 KalamariKing: oh lmao
 Astrobytes: pythons are .... snakes
 KalamariKing: im slow
 Wontonimo: just logged on.  how many people were promoted when legend first opened?
 jrke: was the league opening early today?
 ddreams: 95
 Wontonimo: thanks ddreams
 UndercoverToad: you missed it by 1 hour jrke
 Cjx_1: wow. gl to you champs &lt;3
 actualCoderTrevor: I'll take my legend now, please and thank you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555142154">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555142154</a>
 KalamariKing: god damn
 Cjx_1: almost gives me a sliver of a hope I can make it
 KalamariKing: wiping the freaking floor over here
 Wontonimo: that's good news and bad news.  Good news, that it's really achievable.  Bad news is now i'm gonna want to try
 KalamariKing: only two people have been able to beat me
 Cjx_1: the competition in that bracket will be intense and varied
 aangairbender: this time I had to beat only wood bosses:sweat_smile:
 UndercoverToad: same
 KalamariKing: not to brag but I'm coming for your ranks :smirk:
 UndercoverToad: even reached silver twice
 KalamariKing: I thought wood battles took forever how long until you know your rank
 struct: and got the experience twice
 KalamariKing: this is insane its been like 10 minutes and its only 30% done
 jrke: KalamariKing there are 293 ongoing submissions so you have to wait
 KalamariKing: the battles take forever
 jrke: damn jolindien taking a big lead
 jrke: nice
 struct: now I cant practice vs default ai&#160;:(
 jrke: make legend then
 ddreams: submit the default ai code, then play against your code in the arena
 none_: KalamariKing: after around 40% you are not going to rise much. The closer you are to end of executions, the more you are fighting people around your final position to compare with similar ranks...
 aangairbender: struct submit empty bot and practice vs him
 struct: nah Ill just use the test link :D
 DomiKo: wait
 DomiKo: 106 in legend
 DomiKo: :rage:
 ddreams: 107 when I finish my improvements :p
 jrke: how will they gonna make rerun after end of contest in such a crowded legend?
 dbdr: top 100
 aangairbender: imo legend should have constant size every contest, around 20
 Marchete: 106 legend?
 Marchete: wth
 dbdr: yes&#160;:(
 aangairbender: codingame should create new leagues
 jrke: wood 4
 KalamariKing: or make them harder to pass
 aangairbender: there are so many people nowadays
 KalamariKing: there are so many people in bronze that don't know what they're doing
 aangairbender: chilling
 KalamariKing: this challenge isn't great in this sense because purely random moves can lead to surprisingly good outcomes
 Nerchio: you can be in bronze just printing available actions
 struct: I needed full sim for bronze
 KalamariKing: after beating literally everyone in this league I really hope silver is better
 KalamariKing: str​uct not anymore, unfortunately
 uvBoss: @jrke u simulating?
 jrke: not yet
 jrke: i mean i am not having good eval
 uvBoss: heuristics only?
 creeperZnation4: Yeah, silver league is actually a little challenging coming from wood @KalamariKing XD
 Marchete: gold is no sim, just pick seeds with little neighbours and growing trees that make shadow on enemy and not yours
 jrke: so i am currently heuristic
 kovi: maybe its too late, but now we can see who is doing search and who is doing heuristic
 Marchete: like 4hrs coding
 ddreams: kovi how?
 ddreams: completion?
 kovi: yes
 uvBoss: im trying to implementing a simple search man im noob af
 aangairbender: My search doesnt complete sometimes
 uvBoss: free(): invalid pointerim getting this error but im not even using delete or free keywords
 kovi: some false positives, those who search fast and those who heuritize slow&#160;:)
 RoboStac: are you using a vector?
 uvBoss: well yeah lots
 uvBoss: xD
 aangairbender: dangling pointer?
 ddreams: probably two vectors deallocating the same objects
 uvBoss: OMG memory leak
 RoboStac: often means you have some memory corruption (eg writing outside of an array and when it comes to destroy your vector it tries to free the wrong thing)
 kovi: rather indexing out yeah
 uvBoss: i think i got it thanks guys
 aangairbender: c++ is fun at such moments, when you get some random error like this and have no idea where to look
 ddreams: it's also a bit dependent on the servers they run on, kovi
 RoboStac: uvboss - try putting "#define _GLIBCXX_DEBUG" as the first line of your program
 kovi: ddreans, yes but for this rerun it probably averages out
 RoboStac: (remove it when you finish debugging - it makes things slow)
 ddreams: what's up with your bot, Nerchio?
 Nerchio: whats wrong with it
 KalamariKing: its doing things
 KalamariKing: spooky things
 ddreams: oh, I guess you just resubmitted
 ddreams: that's why you're at the bottom
 ClosetAI: legends get job interview offer, they want more of them
 KalamariKing: no you're joking
 KalamariKing: resubmitting means you have to re-do all the battles
 KalamariKing: even if you were at like 90%
 ddreams: so? :D
 struct: lol ClosetAI
 KalamariKing: SO
 KalamariKing: they take forever
 UndercoverToad: they want more quotes like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/spring-challenge-2020/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/spring-challenge-2020/</a> (at the bottom)
 ClosetAI: I already got a new job, gardener at google
 reCurse: Numbers!
 reCurse: Big!
 KalamariKing: wow python is popular
 KalamariKing: did it have timeout issues on that challenge too?
 UndercoverToad: no, only clojure
 KalamariKing: ok so remember how I was doing really well and then resubmittedwell now I'm doing... well, undefeated
 KalamariKing: so its not all bad
 KalamariKing: although I wasted a good half an hour
 KalamariKing: I'll shut up now gb folks
 uvBoss: can anyone help me with copying a game state?
 KalamariKing: what about it
 uvBoss: how? XD
 ddreams: if you send it to me as a json file, I can copy it for you
 uvBoss: -_-
 uvBoss: i mean when calculating next possible states....how do u do it?
 KalamariKing: by doing so
 KalamariKing: are you using arrays and all that or bitboards
 ddreams: Game nextState = applyMove(game, action)
 KalamariKing: if you're moving the gamestate around a lot I would switch to bitboards
 uvBoss: im using Objects with vectors
 uvBoss: ok i have no clue what bitboards are so let me check
 jrke: bitboards are strong integers representing a game state
 Numby: Any tips on reducing the time it takes to find all legal moves? Is there a better way to store than just a list (Java)?
 jrke: each bit represents a part of state
 Numby: Does bitboard representation help with finding/storing the legal moves at a board state?
 struct: its easier/faster to find
 struct: also shadows are easier
 struct: imo
 DetoBot: yup he is right
 Numby: But still need to loop through the board right? There will still be a loop 0 to 36 for each cell to find the legal moves?
 struct: I dont need loops for shadows
 Noyotens: how to get duplicates items in ts
 ddreams: you do loop for seeds, right?
 uvBoss: o(1)?
 Noyotens: yes
 Numby: Well for shadows I understand you can calculate with shifts but doesnt seem to be a bottleneck for me anyways
 struct: I loop for seeds yes
 ddreams: I still use my pre-bitboard code for seeds
 MindController: Anyone has a good guide bitboards? Totally new thing for me and would like to learn more

 kovi: solid lead by jolindien
 Noyotens: &lt;_&gt;
 MindController: Thanks
 Zenoscave: how many in legend?
 Zenoscave: 100?
 struct: it was like 100
 Zenoscave: wow
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jjj.de/fxt/fxtbook.pdf">https://jjj.de/fxt/fxtbook.pdf</a>that one is on bit magic (among others)
 ABIROOP-RP: 🥴
 Zenoscave: thanks UndercoverToad I'll be reading
 UndercoverToad: that's almost 1000 pages
 Zenoscave: reading *sections
 ZarthaxX: he will read them
 ZarthaxX: trust
 Illedan: Legend of 100?!
 ddreams: sounds like a movie title
 dbdr: I was going to say that even you got in, Illedan, but I see you didn't&#160;;)
 Illedan: Hahaha
 UndercoverToad: remember Illedan, you goal was beating me and not legend
 Illedan: Sure
 UndercoverToad: i am your substitute boss now, as the real one failed
 Illedan: 02D 17H 22MN 29SC
 UndercoverToad: "no sleep till toad is beaten"
 Illedan: I'll just fix my Legend rank 
 Illedan: Ezpz
 Wontonimo: and remember UndercoverToad, you said you'd stop once you got to Legend
 Illedan: You will wake up 1 day with me still awake above you
 Marchete: lol
 GhostManVC: how to seed location
 Zenoscave: Is there a way to tell if your code is in ide vs submit in c#
 Zenoscave: does #ifdef DEBUG or smth work?
 UndercoverToad: no way that i'm aware of
 RoboStac: I think they fixed all the easy ones
 VizGhar: I wonder how you guys compute turns-in-day combinations... with 10 trees to grow 3 to complete and a huge amount of seed placements seems too big for me
 UndercoverToad: try to print the size of the binary maybe
 ddreams: Zenoscave you can easily set your own global variable in the IDE
 Illedan: Submits slow?
 Zenoscave: but I'll submit them on accident lol ddreams
 RoboStac: legend got a full resubmit so there are loads of games being player
 ddreams: Zenoscave oh no... anyway
 Illedan: oh, why on earth would they need a resub now -.-
 ddreams: figure out the ranking without all the games vs the gold scrubs
 dbdr: well, scores were inflated
 dbdr: 60+
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c52a02da-f5a7-46b3-b39c-ddedeaa8fc74">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c52a02da-f5a7-46b3-b39c-ddedeaa8fc74</a>
 UndercoverToad: that might do the trick @Zenoscave
 UndercoverToad: at least to see if it's the same in IDE and arena or not
 Zenoscave: Thanks UndercoverToad
 ashiknur: what will be cutoff for legend?
 ddreams: beat the boss
 UndercoverToad: legend is open already
 RoboStac: theres no limit, just beat the gold boss before the end of the contest
 UndercoverToad: 100
 Marchete: when submitting: SIMS:259825
 ashiknur: wow, I didn't really see it.
 Marchete: on IDE: SIMS:85775
 UndercoverToad: :D
 struct: same cpu?
 Marchete: anyways it's dead slow
 Marchete: CG
 Marchete: CG server
 struct: yes but they have different cpus
 dbdr: yes, arena looked much faster to me too
 Marchete: on my PC (coreI7)  is completely different
 UndercoverToad: I also had a feeling that i'm timing out in the IDE more often than arena
 Marchete: 700k
 tyeir: whats up
 UndercoverToad: the gold boss
 Zenoscave: Yeah I cut my beam width in half and still times out on IDE
 UndercoverToad: wait, no&#160;:(
 tyeir: yo cooking oil 
 cookingoil: what
 Marchete: do you see the same diff on C# simcount, euler / Ille?
 UndercoverToad: did you try my code snipped on submit already Zenoscave?
 tyeir: im rich nigga
 Zenoscave: About to
 UndercoverToad: let me check Marchete
 Illedan: Hahahaha, I had a property that I tweaked a lot. Never set it :sob:
 miszu: good morning children
 miszu: I see legend is open
 UndercoverToad: random arena match: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555188006">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555188006</a>same in IDE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555193950">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555193950</a>
 Bogdan._.: CODE OF KUTULU
 dbdr: that was random :D
 UndercoverToad: arena seems faster stepping through the replay
 dbdr: that sounds weird
 dbdr: are you sleep deprived UndercoverToad?
 Marchete: but it's not that different
 struct: just pray you get the 2.4ghz machine
 UndercoverToad: no, i'm squirrel feeding
 struct: its the best one for me
 solistice: I hope there will be good postmortems for this challenge
 struct: The 3.1ghz machine is the slower one
 solistice: I can't seem to figure out why my sims are so slooow
 solistice: I give up :D
 Zenoscave: Same sizes but pdb is missing in Arena
 VizGhar: solistice same feelings here
 UndercoverToad: and the diagnostics process?
 Marchete: call itself?
 Zenoscave: the socket? Yeah
 UndercoverToad: also: that's an easy way to crash on purpose, isn't it? :imp:
 tyeir: jvfn
 tyeir: hey
 UndercoverToad: "Yeah" = yeah it's there or yeah it's missing?
 Marchete: do you have it working on .Net?
 Zenoscave: It's there
 tyeir: yeah
 Marchete: wher?
 Marchete: where?
 UndercoverToad: try to kill it?
 UndercoverToad: wait, that's a file and not a process
 tyeir: you spelled where wrong
 UndercoverToad: let's inspect processes
 Zenoscave: ok I'll do that too
 tyeir: do you not see these messages
 tyeir: hey
 tyeir: ,gfifhu8j9h0aasg'jfegnv 
 Marchete: I don't know, maybe it's because the massive use of unsafe
 Astrobytes: nice and fast there struct
 Marchete: but IDE is 90k vs 300-400k on submit
 struct: thanks
 Astrobytes: Right, in gold now. Can I stop yet toad?
 struct: thats very strange Marchete
 ddreams: I'm rank 1 in gold now, with an unintentionally submitted 60ms max bot :p
 Marchete: not really
 struct: why?
 ddreams: boss still higher tho
 Marchete: C++ -O0 is dead slow
 struct: true
 Marchete: in fact C# in debug mode is really fast
 VizGhar: How am i supposed to replace those vectors&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: ddreams you know the flags?
 ddreams: you mean #pragma GCC optimize("-O2,inline,omit-frame-pointer,unroll-loops")
 Zenoscave: -O3
 Astrobytes: 3 or fast always
 ddreams: right
 ddreams: thought o3 was for size
 Zenoscave: does anyone use -ffast-math
 Zenoscave: it's a more aggressive optim that helps here
 Astrobytes: enabled by default w/ Ofast isn't it?
 jacek: its in Ofast isnt it
 Zenoscave: probably
 UndercoverToad: Astrobytes 04:52PMRight, in gold now. Can I stop yet toad?
 Astrobytes: I've not even implemented anything about shadows lol
 Astrobytes: Maybe I'll keep playing
 dbdr: legend is the new gold
 Astrobytes: That's just sad&#160;:(
 dbdr: yeah
 Gabbek: so that explains why I've reached gold this time and silver the last time... :D
 solistice: 15.000ns for 1 sim
 solistice: that seeems too slow
 ddreams: 15k ns or 15ns?
 solistice: 15k
 ddreams: :p
 solistice: 15ns would be godlike
 solistice: I moved everything from lists and stuff to bitboard
 solistice: I see improvement
 solistice: but still a bottleneck
 KalamariKing: solstice are you using freedom notation or not
 UndercoverToad: so 1k sims in 15msdoesn't sound completely off
 KalamariKing: 15.000 is 15 to me
 Astrobytes: alright, afk for a bit, back later
 ddreams: I just quadrupled my evaluation speed, but getting worse results
 UndercoverToad: good idea, i'll do an Astro
 struct: which language_
 struct: *?
 Michael_Howard: T-shirt will be the new Legend
 ddreams: me? C++
 solistice: woops, yeah 15,000
 solistice: I'm using C#
 solistice: btw UndercoverToad, that's local in debug, not on CG
 KalamariKing: silver lets go
 WatchTower: whats a easy language for beginners? 
 KalamariKing: python
 CodeDecodeDev: Python
 KelvinAndHubbles: Python
 ddreams: Snakeylang
 WatchTower: ok thank you!
 jacek: fim++
 VizGhar: Spanish
 Ra777: anyone else  seeing different positions(yourself) in LAST BATTLES view and in LEADERBOARD window?
 ddreams: after page reload?
 raxkin: the position in the LAST BATTLES view is the position in your current league. in LEADERBOARD its across all leagues
 Ra777: yes after reload too.
 Ra777: im in the gold league so possition should be the same.it is first time im seeing such a thing
 solistice: how much turns you guys average per sim?
 gmessier: Ra777 the legend league is open so that's why
 solistice: any ballpark?
 Counterbalance: 1?
 Zenoscave: solistice 1 sim = 1 turn
 Michael_Howard: :sob:
 Michael_Howard: paavan@jsagroup.co.uk
 Zenoscave: here that's the common nomenclature
 Ra777: oh didn't noticed about legend
 Michael_Howard: oops sorry

 Chainman: Can you get in gold with just heuristics looking at next move?
 Numby: I had 2k games from start to finish with random moves before adding pruning if that helps (was rank 700  gold before messing my constants lol)
 gmessier: Yes
 Ra777: yes im in gold just with looking for next move
 gmessier: My current bot is technically very "stupid" and is ranked 811. I apply some filters on action, but by example for grow I just take the first in the possible list after filtering...
 solistice: wait Zenoscave, I mean by sim that I'm doing MCTS and a sim is one step in the MCTS (so 1 sim has x turns where x is the number to finish the random playout
 solistice: is that wrong then?
 gmessier: Still work on my beam search to replace the heuristics... without so much success yet :P
 Chainman: yeah
 Chainman: I went straight to sim/graph search, but it is having many problems. 
 Chainman: MCTS that's interesting
 ddreams: how many times do you reach the end of the game, solistice?
 solistice: about 800 times
 solistice: which is not enough imo
 solistice: to have good results
 ddreams: yeah, you barely scratch the surface
 solistice: so maybe MCTS is not the way to go
 RoboStac: solstice - I think most other people would count 1 sim as 1 turn in the ide (eg both players doing 1 action) as thats more comparable across algorithms. I'd be surprised if anyone is doing random rollouts with any success
 solistice: but I alwasy thought when you guys were talking about simming, that we were talking about the same thing LOL
 struct: 1 sim = new state
 solistice: then maybe i'm not slow at all
 solistice: just using the wrong algorithm
 VizGhar: sim = day or action?
 TheBatMan_TM: any of y'all wanna use foreign modules in #coc?
 TheBatMan_TM: use this import osos.system('pip install &lt;module&gt;')
 TheBatMan_TM: *resend
 TheBatMan_TM: import osos.system('pip install &lt;module&gt;')
 Nerchio: life hacks?
 solistice: was that a question for me, VizGhar?
 VizGhar: for example yes
 VizGhar: I've had 1 action = 1 nodebut I failed to evaluate it
 gmessier: 1 node = 1 state
 VizGhar: what is state?
 VizGhar: now i have 1 day = 1 node and timeouting, because I cant compute possible days fast enough
 jacek: baby dont hurt me
 orangesnowfox: (don't hurt me)
 gmessier: state = the board position (trees + score + suns)
 Noyotens: ;_(
 gmessier: An action by itself can be ranked. It's the result. The state of the game after applying the action
 gmessier: *can't
 solistice: beam search is a heuristic search, no?
 ddreams: yes
 solistice: are there good possibilities without heuristics?
 orangesnowfox: Well, actions can be ranked by "likely best" which is useful for minimax...
 ddreams: you probably need to think in this game
 solistice: I hate thinking
 solistice: makes my brain hurt
 ddreams: exactly
 ddreams: probably why so many don't like this game :D
 ddreams: computer, think for me
 solistice: that would be sweet
 ddreams: isn't that how most of the AI competitions work?
 VizGhar: sure gmessier but you can get to some state only by applying action... I want to know whether the action is single action (game turn) or set of actions where last is WAIT
 gmessier: You can do both
 solistice: it depends: the game defines a round as a day, where a day has multiple turns. A day ends when both players have waited (so ends whenever the last player says "WAIT"). 
 VizGhar: but evaluating state after one day is much easier then after 1 action
 gmessier: Yes but you can "simulate" a turn with all possible actions OR you can "simulate" a day with all possible list of actions.
 MSmits: the branching you get by simulating full days is pretty extreme. You may need to do some serious pruning then
 gmessier: It depends if you put limitations
 MSmits: thats what i mean by pruning
 solistice: wouldn't that eventually even out MSmits? It would have higher depth but eventually have same amount of nodes, no?
 gmessier: The order of most actions are not important. You will have the same result if you GROW 1 then 2 or if you GROW 2 then 1.
 MSmits: it would be far less gradual though
 MSmits: you would lose some states earlier
 none_: gmessier: not true
 none_: if you already have tree of given size
 MSmits: in other words, just grow 2 before you grow 1&#160;:)
 VizGhar: order is important
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: large first, then small
 gmessier: you are right none_... damn that's why... :P 
 none_: I feel like this game is primarily about these small things. I'm in legendary without even considering future moves.
 gmessier: That explains why my day simulation was so bad :D
 none_: there are couple things like that I picked from better players...:)
 gmessier: But, I the end my point was, you can reject many possibilities to reduce the branching (by example, prevent to grow a smaller tree first)
 KalamariKing: yes finally my dumbass bot did the thing I told it to :clap::clap::clap::clap:
 none_: even that might be beneficial if you don't have enough to grow bigger...
 none_: or sometime even if you have... for example bigger tree caught between his trees and small tree on nice sunny place...
 gmessier: I don't mean don't grow at all a small tree. I mean if you can do both, to the big one first
 none_: yep.
 gmessier: But it's meanly if you want to calculate days and not turns. You can remove some possibilities if you already know that it will be less efficient.
 none_: I still think that calculating whole day is big unknown. You can plan as much as you want, but you don't know what your opponent will do... 
 solistice: unless you try to add predictions
 solistice: but then ur working on turn level again
 solistice: and my sentence made no sense because of that
 none_: yeah, but still they are predictions
 ItsNotABug: @RoboStac. You're the only person in UK in legend. Good job
 gmessier: I'm not sure I will take the opponent into account at all.
 Chainman: Just ignore opponent, they don't matter
 Chainman: :wink:
 gmessier: Yeah that's what I think. It's not like for the last Spring Contest. Even the Fall Contest, it was not useful to check the opponent except in legend maybe...
 gmessier: Computing an opponent AI reduce by half your time to check your best move.
 therealbeef: Urgh, spent half the day debugging the code I wrote last night while drinking&#160;:'(
 KalamariKing: lmao what a sentence
 Lucky30_: hello everyone
 Lucky30_: how is your day so far
 Michael_Howard: Like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555213893">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555213893</a>
 ddreams: the rest of us debugged the code we wrote sober
 Chainman: It's a wonderful day to rebug. 
 KalamariKing: its a wonderful day to write a bot that works perfectly and then tune its parameters but it doesn't liten
 KalamariKing: listen*
 Lucky30_: nice
 alchemsti: Just took a long break, now would really like to make legend....Missed easiest time I guess (right after it opens)
 Lucky30_: are all legends using simulations??
 Nerchio: no
 Lucky30_: oO
 ZarthaxX: perl rank 16
 Cjx_1: I believe someone said last night that their was at least one person up there using pure heuristics and loops. Just the grapevine though
 Lucky30_: meaning i still have a chance, a really really really small chance
 ddreams: several legends
 CouscousAgha: which rank should I get to play vs the boss to legend?
 Lucky30_: currently even rank 1gold is not better then the boss
 AlMualem: Greetings guys,i hope you are all doing great...this is a replay from a game vs silver Boss <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555255130">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555255130</a> any suggestions for improvement please?
 KalamariKing: the little messages make it so much better
 Chainman: Is it better to create a getter function in python or just return self.variable?
 AlMualem: sorry mate
 JEDWF: should i learn python or c ++
 KalamariKing: Chainman I would say just get the variable, the getter would do the same thing just with more overhead I would think?
 KalamariKing: JEDWF personally, python is easier but c++ is so much more powerful
 AlMualem: kalamari are you greek?
 Chainman: yes I'm thinking that, maybe getter is just to make it more readable or creating an api.
 KalamariKing: AlMualem no, why
 Chainman: Learn python first might be optimal
 AlMualem: because kalamari is the greek word for squid,and i thought you were
 jacek: oO
 actualCoderTrevor: AlMualem sometimes your bot says "seed my little minions" but doesn't actually seed. Is that a bug?
 actualCoderTrevor: Because you pass up opportunities to seed for free when you have no seeds on the baord.
 actualCoderTrevor: So, either you are trying to seed with an invalid move or just aren't seeding when you could be
 JEDWF: Do I have to be good at math for coding?
 ddreams: no
 AlMualem: aaa just a string i forgot to delete during my modifications&#160;:/
 AlMualem: oups
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh in that case you should seed when it's free to do so
 Smelty: oh theres legend league now?
 KalamariKing: someone explain how I wrote a bot that gets CRUSHED by the silver bot but I'm climbing the ranks rather fast
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: my bot stuck at bottom of gold
 JEDWF: can you guys recommend me some sites that i can learn coding 
 Nerchio: KalamariKing i can crush some people and then get crushed next game
 KalamariKing: JEDWF google
 JEDWF: google :sweat_smile:
 JEDWF: so tue
 Keiysuke: JEDWF I've just reach the gold ligue for 1st time and i did not use any math method to do it.So it's possible to go far without maths :D
 JEDWF: true*
 AlMualem: with my last submit i went from ~1,300th to 324(and keep going) ,but i need improvements for the god damn bot
 AlMualem: :P
 Chainman: multiply or add in the score function hmmm
 JEDWF: I learned coding for five months, but I can't think of anything
 AlMualem: damn you silver boss :P
 Chainman: I don't know how to decide
 Smelty: o-oh my
 Chainman: boosssooooot
 Smelty: im losing to gold boss lol
 Smelty: MiyazaBoss
 Chainman: I hope to lose to that bot
 ddreams: select it as your opponent in the IDE and try your luck
 Smelty: lol
 Chainman: That is only for those in gold lol
 GustafAdolf: go
 Smelty: lol
 Chainman: yes
 AlMualem: @actualCoderTrevor i will include this feature you proposed (seeding when its free) and hope for the best
 Smelty: bruh gold boss stronk
 actualCoderTrevor: gl AlMualem!
 AlMualem: ty mate
 Smelty: 1 thing thoguh
 Chainman: Who going for silver bossooot?
 Smelty: it wil make parent tree dormant 
 Smelty: so it isnt completely free
 Hasuzawa: anyone send me a link to the chat of germany? trying to stay informed
 AlMualem: @chainman  me
 AlMualem: @Smelty yes you are right....tests tests tests it is!
 Smelty: rip me, looks like i'm ending in gold
 Chainman: so many days left
 Chainman: yes @AlMualem let's do this
 Smelty: 2 days xD
 Chainman: actually will take me probably 3 hours to get heurisitcs to compete against silver boss, now that I rewrote code from scratch.
 AlMualem: if i reach Gold my task in the contest is done....i will be very happy (regarding my experience in coding)
 AlMualem: So Lets do this!!!!!!!!!!
 geppoz: hi, which is the class that contains the "main" method to be called by the brutaltester? "Referee" doesn't have it...
 Counterbalance: you only need to run the jar itself; the main class is in the manifest.. (so: java -jar spring-...jar)
 geppoz: no manifest there&#160;:(
 Nerchio: i wrote you pm

 ddreams: taking a day off
 Digginwings: wood 2 league is so easy
 ScottytheHotty: its actually wood 1 league
 Digginwings: it shows wood 2 league for me
 KalamariKing: ScottytheHotty I would say there's an error somewhere
 Chainman: y'all trolling him?
 Chainman: I thought it was wood 2, but I don't remember
 Chainman: Should be easy to check
 Digginwings: it is wood 2
 aglaglaglagla: Hey, I'm having trouble running the brutaltester for this game. It only runs a single round (or so it seems) and then stops. Any idea how to fix this?
 ddreams: paste your command line
 ddreams: a single game or a single round of a game?
 aglaglaglagla: a single round
 aglaglaglagla: java -jar target/spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -p1 "../../silver/target/release/silver" -p2 "../../silver/target/release/silver"
 ddreams: do you get an error message?
 aglaglaglagla: yeah some warnings and  a logger error
 aglaglaglagla: still runs though
 aglaglaglagla: "ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console. Set system property 'log4j2.debug' to show Log4j2 internal initialization logging."
 ddreams: I think you have to fix it
 ddreams: it's a warning, but any output from the referee makes it stop
 aglaglaglagla: Oh ok!
 Whatar: its a fix you have to do to the pom.xml
 Whatar: sorry, not true
 Whatar: you have to add log4j2.xml to ./src/main/resources
 Whatar: inside you past this
 Whatar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2b78c7e0-87fa-4f0f-a90a-1c77f74307d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2b78c7e0-87fa-4f0f-a90a-1c77f74307d3</a>
 Whatar: anyway you also need to find the switch that regulates the league inside the source code and delete wood 1 and 2 from the options
 aglaglaglagla: Ok this solves the Error indeed!
 aglaglaglagla: Nice it works!
 aglaglaglagla: thx&#160;:)
 Digginwings: yay
 Digginwings: this spring challenge is pretty easy im not going to lie
 KalamariKing: my guy
 Samzok123: hi
 Digginwings: what
 KalamariKing: its rather easy for some of you
 Numby: I'm just happy there's no graph traversals
 Samzok123: ok
 ddreams: bronze will be harder
 KalamariKing: its pretty hard for the rest of usthis is my first time doing bitboards and search algos
 Digginwings: ok
 ddreams: wood leagues are the tutorials
 ddreams: teaches the game and the rules
 Digginwings: hmm
 Digginwings: is it bad i barely know what you are saying
 ddreams: not really
 Digginwings: ok good
 Digginwings: jk
 Chainman: oh 114 - 125 against silver boss, maybe I'm getting there already
 Chainman: I need more though
 Zenoscave: Chainman do several tests.&#160;! isn't enough
 Zenoscave: 1*
 Chainman: You are correct 131-101 haha
 Zenoscave: 30 should be sufficient
 Zenoscave: For silver ata least

 Zenoscave: lower*
 Aniboy: Hi Guys
 Digginwings: if i beat the boss but fail a lot of battles will I still pass
 Zenoscave: Digginwings depends on who you lose to and how often
 Digginwings: ok
 Zenoscave: and how bad you beat the boss
 gmessier: you must have a better TrueSkill of the boss. Not beat it in one battle
 Aniboy: Do you know how to check Validator 1,2 and all at the end of our code submission?
 Zenoscave: ^ 
 Digginwings: ok
 Aniboy: I am getting validator 1 failed but dont understand why?
 KalamariKing: because its wrong
 KalamariKing: duh
 KalamariKing: ok sorry sorry, which game?
 Astrobytes: Right. This IDE play limit thing's doing my fking head in
 Westicles: So many legends, I thought is was supposed to be 10 or so
 Astrobytes: Clearly CG believe otherwise&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: btw Astrobytes you have my absolution to quit. i'm not motivated myself either
 Astrobytes: I'll maybe do something tomorrow, I'll see
 UndercoverToad: was that reverse psychology?
 UndercoverToad: also: where did that Magu s suddenly come from?
 Astrobytes: No. Just saying I probably won't in a roundabout way.
 Astrobytes: Aren't you doing another comp this weekend euler?
 K3K: random :rage: emote for the play limit thingy, don't mind me
 UndercoverToad: codejam tomorrow afternoon
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 UndercoverToad: my motivation for this is higher than for CG
 asedrftgyhujasdrcfvgbhjnkmwsedrf: hello
 RDty: is there going to be another challenge directly after this one?
 Astrobytes: No.
 ddreams: hi asedrftgyhujasdrcfvgbhjnkmwsedrf
 Whatar: there are 2 challens a here, one in spring on in fall
 Whatar: *year
 Astrobytes: There used to be loads every year. Well, quite a few. Now just 2 official ones.
 Whatar: I didn't know that
 Astrobytes: I think... 2018 was the busiest competition wise? 2019?
 UndercoverToad: let's wait for their announcement after this one ends
 Astrobytes: Yeah&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: i see some changes coming
 UndercoverToad: 2018 had 6 contests
 UndercoverToad: counting locam sprint+marathon as 1
 alchemsti:&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Yes I agree euler
 alchemsti: 6 feels kind of excessive. OTOH, you don't feel as bad if you miss one
 Astrobytes: We were really spoiled that year
 Astrobytes: You still get a few semi-private contests from companies a few times a year too. They're variations of existing multis though.
 RoboStac: 2018 was the year with the 3 good semi private ones too (thales/decathalon/amadeus) 
 UndercoverToad: the most exciting thing the website has to offer when there is no contest: community multiplayer games
 Westicles: Changes?  Surely they won't make them escape rooms?
 Astrobytes: Yeah that too robo. That Amadeus one was great 
 UndercoverToad: was Amadeus the soccer thing?
 RoboStac: no, that was decathalon
 UndercoverToad: wait, the planet wars
 Astrobytes: No, the graph one 
 Astrobytes: yeah
 RoboStac: the soccer probably wasn't good overall but it was good for me
 Astrobytes: lol, you won that?
 RoboStac: if that had been more than a couple of days it would have got very messy
 RoboStac: yeah
 UndercoverToad: the bicycle that they decided to pay in money then?
 Astrobytes: I did the other two but I missed the decathlon
 RoboStac: yep, they gave me lots of decathalon gift money instead of a bike. I bought a bike
 UndercoverToad: was the third one the email leak contest?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: No, that was Klee, codebusters one
 Astrobytes: 4th that year? I don't remember the order tbh
 RoboStac: didn't do that one so can't check when it was on my profile
 Astrobytes: I signed up but didn't submit, I strongly dislike that game and all its variants
 UndercoverToad: but what about Sopra? did you dislike that one too?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I didn't do it.
 Astrobytes: The last one, the Amadeus Sofia Labs one was fun
 UndercoverToad: so many contests without telling names
 UndercoverToad: 3 player single-pod CSB with 360° rotation
 Astrobytes: I was referring to it as SLSF2442
 actualCoderTrevor: Okay so I guess we're just not allowed to test code in the IDE anymore? "Some time" has become "a long time"
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh the error says "A period of time"
 Astrobytes: The play limit threshold has been lowered. It's *extremely* annoying
 actualCoderTrevor: agreed
 dbf: we need premium accounts with higher limits
 Astrobytes: :D
 Nerchio: i'd pay for that just to support cg if it meant more support for 5%
 Nerchio: :joy:
 ddreams: could pay for your own test/game server for the entire contest
 Astrobytes: That could get real pricey, real quick
 geppoz: :D
 geppoz: depth:44 states to explore:10193 ms:79 ixTot=1146018
 Counterbalance: 12 bucks? doable
 geppoz: pruning random seems not best strat
 geppoz: so fast but so bad
 ddreams: surprised?
 Nerchio: geppoz depth 44 with 10k nodes only
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 Nerchio: or am i not understanding
 geppoz: 1M states evaluated
 Nerchio: ok that makes more sense
 geppoz: 10k exploded at that deep
 geppoz: but then i choose 2k rand
 geppoz: never mind, so bad
 Astrobytes: Noted for future reference: do not prune randomly ... :P
 ddreams: does anyone know how to get the graphics working locally?
 jrke: download referee and set it up ddreams
 ddreams: I have it, but it doesn't split up the sprite image, so most of the graphics are missing
 jrke: wht
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/RKIGcgU">https://imgur.com/a/RKIGcgU</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I had a misconception for days... I thought the use of a 2nd seed could like block the enemy from high value cells, but that 1 sun cost seed hinders my own expansion that I lose
 jacek: oh my
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did so many tests for nothing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so after abandoning bad ideas, i should make gold today
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can't search deep enough
 MSmits: heuristics can take you to legend apparently, but it's not easy
 MSmits: i'm still 44th gold with a search
 jrke: MSmits thats why i am still trying heuristic 
 MSmits: not a bad idea jrke
 Wontonimo: PatrickMcGinnisII I had that idea also, and just didn't get around to testing it.
 Wontonimo: finally have a sim bot that does better than my ifelse bot
 Astrobytes: jacek: did you give up?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: seed placement while optimizing growth curve is key
 CouscousAgha: same, only using heuristic but now i feel stuck without figuring out the best cases for cutting tree
 CouscousAgha: I thought figuring out where to seed was the challenge, but the real one is when to cut
 jrke: me too 
 jrke: my problem is also when to cut
 MSmits: I am convinced this is what is keeping me from legend also
 jacek: Astrobytes contests are not my thing though this one best suits my interests
 Astrobytes: So still trying then?
 MSmits: what is it about this contest that makes it interesting jacek&#160;?
 jacek: maybe ill get t gold
 Astrobytes: It's a board game!
 jacek: its board, its hex, no fow
 UndercoverToad: so jacek is the 95% that votes against contests in the survey?
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: jacek: you don't even need to implement shadows for gold
 MSmits: i'm  curious to see what the real wording of that question was
 jacek: the only thing i never mastered was simultant moves
 MSmits: and the result
 slamo: I wonder how many in the top 20 are simming vs not simming
 MSmits: jacek the only thing i know for that is smitsimax... I produced that brainfart because, just like you, I had no clue what to do
 MSmits: duct works too
 MSmits: never done that myself
 Astrobytes: slamo: My guess is 19 vs 1
 MSmits: in this contest it would be tricky to use either of those
 UndercoverToad: Based on a survey we did several months ago (the small questions on the home page) and that get 166811 replies, the replies to «&#160;What do you expect from CodinGame?&#160;» show that only 1.64% of the respondants said «&#160;Compete against other coders&#160;» but 33% reply «&#160;Improve my skills by practicing&#160;» and 17% «&#160;Just have fun while coding&#160;». This is why we begin to shift our communication around events to talk more about «&#160;practice&#160;» and «&#160;fun&#160;».
 slamo: currently 22nd with only looking ahead to the start of the next turn, so here's to trying to be the 1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm pushing everyone up in top silver
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 MSmits: UndercoverToad could you give multiple answers to this question?
 Astrobytes: Nice one slamo!
 MSmits: or was it 1 answer possible?
 UndercoverToad: 1 answer
 MSmits: thats bad then
 MSmits: because people may want to have fun while coding and still appreciate a contest
 UndercoverToad: as well as the voting power of each user. think about the school classes coming here for 1 lesson and then never returning
 UndercoverToad: the school class has 20 times the voting power of a regular user
 Astrobytes: Loaded question tbh, results can be intepreted as they see fit
 MSmits: btw,  i might have answered here: "Improve my skills by practicing"
 MSmits: because it's true
 UndercoverToad: i think i said "fun"
 UndercoverToad: contest is a subset of fun
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's a poor questionnaire
 PatrickMcGinnisII: anyone without an avatar should lose trueskill pts
 Astrobytes: Highly unscientific.
 MSmits: btw, I do this professionally, I design several of these a year
 slamo: ** goes to add an avatar
 Astrobytes: Peers would give bad reviews.
 Illedan: PatrickMcGinnisII, CG should generate images based on Nicks..
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: I would get the same avatar :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: automatonIlledan generate my avatar
 Illedan: Maybe that is my next project xD
 UndercoverToad: how CG surveys and the knowledge of the outcome feel like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0maYbn8ED-A&amp;ab_channel=delukxz">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0maYbn8ED-A&amp;ab_channel=delukxz</a>
 Astrobytes: omg
 solistice: could someone try and explain me how simming works? Without heuristics, that is?
 UndercoverToad: you generate all possible moves and resulting boards
 PatrickMcGinnisII: solistice just apply moves by you and your opponent and eval the result
 solistice: doesnt eval mean heuristics?
 UndercoverToad: instead of trying to find an action that you like, you rate the outcome of each action
 solistice: since you can never sim all moves?
 UndercoverToad: eval = rating the outcome
 solistice: maybe I just got my terms wrong
 Astrobytes: Yes, heuristics are used in the evaluation function
 Astrobytes: Also perhaps in pruning moves
 MSmits: solistice when you do a search, you somehow navigate a tree of gamestates. At various points in this tree you may want to evaluate the gamestate
 solistice: so minimax = simming?
 Astrobytes: Any search algorithm means you have to simulate
 Astrobytes: Looking ahead by any number of turns is simulation. Search is separate.
 MSmits: yes in any algorithm for a game where you work with a search tree you will be simulating something
 solistice: cool cool, then I got it right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not gonna make it out of silver, but whoever I pushed out..yourwelcome
 MSmits: minimax is not simming though
 solistice: huh wait
 MSmits: minimax is the search type, the fact that you need to simulate things is a byproduct
 Astrobytes: Simming is just simulating.
 solistice: okaaaay, got it!
 MSmits: you can also simulate without a search
 Illedan: Siming is the act of applying an action to the Environment and updating the Environment based on the action.
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: just try different actions to see what happens
 MSmits: Illedan nice definition
 MSmits: except when you say environment you usually also have agents. Those agents also need updates
 Illedan: Those are parts of the environment
 MSmits: allright then
 Illedan: and those are usually the ones doing the action
 Astrobytes: ^
 solistice: maybe stupid question then: how else could you do contests like this? Just look at possible actions and chose according to that, regardless of what outcome could be?
 MSmits: you could pick actions according to some rule
 MSmits: without even seeing what the actions accomplish exactly
 Westicles: There's a stimming joke in here somewhere
 solistice: thanks MSmits!
 MSmits: if (I can afford to grow a tree to size 3) do so
 slamo: solstice: you can code in rules that optimize towards something you think is important 
 slamo: without having to check 1000s of states to find the optimal
 Astrobytes: I believe the correct terms are reflex vs model-based agents
 Astrobytes: There are other types but for the sake of simplicity.
 UndercoverToad: "how else could you do contests like this?"there are detailed writeups for previous contests.search for "feedback and strategies" on the forum
 MSmits: people using many different approaches in those
 MSmits: some doing quite well with simple programs
 slamo: I need to practice my simming/search for next contest so that I can try for top spots 
 jrke: slamo you are 22 without sim?
 MSmits: slamo it might be a while before you search better than your heuristics, since you are obviously quite good at those
 Astrobytes: That's contest-specific, not all contests require it. Though it's certainly useful.
 MSmits: the rest of CG requires search very often
 MSmits: especially simple board games
 Astrobytes: Ohhhh yes.
 UndercoverToad: this contest is pretty search heavy in my opinion (as well as the last one with the witches)
 slamo: yes 22 without sim. I optimize for something very specific and it does really well
 UndercoverToad: pacman was doable with some if-else to a certain degree
 MSmits: personally i feel this one is more heuristic favored than pacman
 MSmits: I find it much harder to get a search to do what I want my bot to do here
 Astrobytes: Yes, heuristics can go far here but search-based was my initial opinion and that hasn't changed.
 slamo: oh I agree
 Westicles: slamo, that's impressive
 Astrobytes: I think the combination of the two is the approach MSmits
 UndercoverToad: and the C++ block at the top confirms this
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: UndercoverToad you forget the 100-200 players below that with beamsearches
 UndercoverToad: :D
 MSmits: I think I could still write a better heuristic bot than my current search one&#160;:(
 MSmits: never happened to me in a contest
 MSmits: i had a beamsearch in code a la mode :P
 UndercoverToad: i see it coming: Sunday evening you get that one idea and WOOSH
 MSmits: I guess I see why you would think that, but I have already thought a LOT about this game
 MSmits: hopefully you're right
 Astrobytes: Perhaps thinking less is better
 ZarthaxX: smitooo go legend
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: i'm always confident that you will make it even when I doubt about myself
 UndercoverToad: that seems bi-directional
 MSmits: we'll see what happens
 MSmits: my main problem is this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555384096">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555384096</a>
 Magus: Sometimes, you can be top 3 by mistake
 MSmits: see how my bot completes trees and is left with too low income near the end?
 UndercoverToad: consistent mistake Magus?
 MSmits: I think that is what is stopping me
 ZarthaxX: Magus what haha
 UndercoverToad: i submitted to #3 earlier today and then the same bot was 10th
 Magus: UndercoverToad: To be honest, I submitted the wrong file.
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 UndercoverToad: :rofl:
 aCat: :D
 ZarthaxX: best ending
 UndercoverToad: do you have some more files? I would take one
 Magus: it was just a local feature, results were bad with brutaltester :D
 UndercoverToad: what did you submit? your fantastic bits?
 MSmits: lol
 Illedan: I think you submitted my file.. Let me take a look
 kovi: last 3 contests i have been top3 on recalc and always fell on last recalc
 Astrobytes: People seem to be having less luck with brutaltester this time around vs actual submits
 Magus: But kovi and jolin are hard to beat
 MSmits: yeah, this game for sure has some overfitting
 kovi: ^
 UndercoverToad: you can only beat kovi in the recalc
 kovi: overfit: especially when adding opponent prediction
 slamo: I was playing with the idea of trying to decide whether to continue to predict or not based on how accurate my predictions are for a current match
 kovi: same&#160;:)
 slamo: well that gives me a little more confidence to try it&#160;:) 
 slamo: at this points just trying to squeeze anything I can out of my hueristics 
 salmon: is score a win percentage? 
 UndercoverToad: it's according to the TrueSkill algorithm
 salmon: ah, thx
 UndercoverToad: score change for wins/losses also depends on the score difference between you and the opponent
 UndercoverToad: in rare cases you can even lose a bit of points for a win
 salmon: yeah, I'm familiar with algorithm
 UndercoverToad: nice
 jacek: oO
 NinjaDoggy: you can lose points for a win? O.o
 xMistySenpai: wow that was easy to advance a league
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy this happens when a player is much stronger than the players who are submitting
 MSmits: there is a maximum rating you can be ahead
 MSmits: i think it's +12 points or something
 ClockSort: @ninjadoggy you inspired me to upgrade my MC to MCTS. it looks very promising -- 18 wins, 5 losses vs my old bot so far. Thank you!
 ClockSort: it was not easy to write my first MCTS, haha
 Illedan: Matches very slow?
 Astrobytes: Extremely, yes
 ZarthaxX: since beginning of legend
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Illedan: Damn Legend
 Illedan: Let me inn
 Astrobytes: Oh your weekend bot didn't make it?
 Astrobytes: It was hanging in there like a champ for ages
 Illedan: Nah, I changed 2 params and try a resub
 xMistySenpai: 18/26 battles, wew
 Illedan: It was 10th when Legend opened -.-
 Astrobytes: ah damn!
 UndercoverToad: i'm surprised that legend is still "only" 108 players
 Illedan: Let there be 109 :pray:
 UndercoverToad: usually it goes up quickly because of ranking randomness
 ZarthaxX: boss was a rank 60
 ZarthaxX: so maybe there already was randomness
 UndercoverToad: so that was teh ..
 Nerchio: yeah the idea is that boss was better but ranked worse at first
 UndercoverToad: yes
 Illedan: hmm
 ClockSort: compared to Fall2020, gold is huge, legend is only "large"
 Nerchio: and now in gold are people 110+ vs boss rank 60
 RoboStac: I think this was different because boss was submitted and ended low, whereas normally they just insert it with an inflated rating so it falls
 RoboStac: so this boss gained points after the league opened - silver boss dropped quite quickly
 UndercoverToad: that's why it's called Fall contest
 UndercoverToad: this one is Spring
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Illedan: I'm as bad on selling tress as I'm at selling stocks when the market crashes -.- 
 xMistySenpai: 26/30 BATTLES
 xMistySenpai: sorr for the capsy
 jacek: eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://fuckelonmusk.co/">https://fuckelonmusk.co/</a>
 ClockSort: my MCTS bot, vs my old MC bot: 36 wins, 13 losses, 1 draw. :sunglasses:
 ClockSort: I'm now a believer in MCTS
 MSmits: mcts on this contes huh
 MSmits: surprising
 ClockSort: @MSmits I just submitted it. I'll let you know where it lands
 Dubluce: Has anyone else's game display seemed to have crashed? Mine's been a grey rectangle starting today
 MSmits: does it play out till end of game ClockSort?
 MSmits: as a random rollout?
 ClockSort: after turn 7 then it rolls out fully.
 alchemsti: grey screen -- all the damn time. I do chrome://restart and it's usually better.
 MSmits: that's nice, then you can use the endgame scoring
 MSmits: instead of some arbitrary eval
 ClockSort: i really struggled to make a good eval
 ClockSort: "most suns" just isn't cutting it&#160;:)
 MSmits: no it really doesn't
 Dubluce: Thanks for the chrome://restart tip!
 MSmits: getting mighty tired of trying to test locally and then getting 5% WR when the bot does just as good on the leaderboard as the previous version
 dbdr: that sounds really weird
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: maybe some overfitting? except reversed? &gt;thinking:
 dbdr: :thinking:
 MSmits: it's overfitting yeah
 MSmits: but that's a feature of this game I think
 dbdr: underfitting
 UndercoverToad: overstarving
 Astrobytes: overfitting against himself
 Zenoscave: undertale
 MSmits: for example, someone can cut you off and take all the nutrients if they start completing just a bit sooner
 MSmits: could be 1 param
 jacek: overfatting
 Astrobytes: undertaking
 Zenoscave: don't let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
 MSmits: how long have you waited for an opportunity to say this Zenoscave&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Years
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: since 1998
 Astrobytes: lol, I think I'd stopped watching that wrestling a few years previous
 Zenoscave: UndercoverToad gets it
 UndercoverToad: oh, that's about wrestling
 MSmits: ofc, he's the Undertoad
 UndercoverToad: sometimes zeno writes something and I have no idea what that means
 Zenoscave: it's a copypasta
 Astrobytes: Legion of Toad
 XeroOl: hi how are y'all doing
 Zenoscave: Same thing but when Zeno writes zeno never knows what zeno means
 Astrobytes: Hm. Well, my wrestling name is still Ultimate Worrier
 Illedan: zenile?
 MSmits: :grin:
 xMistySenpai: RANK 625 WEW
 MSmits: ClockSort looks like your mcts  has similar performance to my beamsearch
 Lowz: Finally made it to silver! (I know I'm super late lol) 
 MSmits: grats
 Astrobytes: nice one Lowz
 UndercoverToad: now you can fight against Patrick
 ClockSort: @msmits i expected 1st to 50th Gold... it's underperforming&#160;:(
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 xMistySenpai: says i ned to be better ranked than the boss? who's the boss? cause boss 3 has no rank it appears
 UndercoverToad: but a score
 ClockSort: ooh i think there's a bug in my simulator that said it was so good
 Astrobytes: Boss 3?
 UndercoverToad: the boss is always at the top of the league
 UndercoverToad: those who rank above will leave the league
 MSmits: rankless
 xMistySenpai: well i find it funny im surrounded by level 5 and 6's
 Astrobytes: Which game?
 ClockSort: @Astrobytes spring challenge 2021 :D
 ClockSort: j/k
 xMistySenpai: coders strike back, level 3
 Lowz: No new rules/conditions from bronze silver? Is it the same case going from silver to gold? 
 Zenoscave: Yes Lowz
 ClockSort: @MSmits ok it's doing better now, 200th gold and climbing
 Lowz: :thumbsup_tone3:
 Astrobytes: where were you at before the submit ClockSort?
 ClockSort: 140th gold :P
 Astrobytes: Ah :D
 ClockSort: ok there is no doubt that the new bot is better
 ClockSort: i think resubmits have a hard time climbing to the level that a 24-hour-old bot is at
 ClockSort: is there a way that people test their new versions against their old? I've heard rumor of something called a brutaltester?
 geppoz: y, but still not working for me
 geppoz: it exits at first move
 geppoz: as if my bots aren't giving output&#160;:(
 geppoz: but I see their stderr in log of the first thinking, so they are running
 Nerchio: you probably get timeouts which i had problems with too
 Nerchio: usually need to make time longer in the referee
 Nerchio: but thats why i kinda just run games in the referee not in brutaltester
 geppoz: that happens also launching a single game
 geppoz: without brutaltester
 ClockSort: @msmits 100% battles complete. it landed at #87 gold. so it was an improvement after all.
 7amasa: Anyone in legend with just heuristics?
 ClockSort: anyone in top 3 with just heuristics?
 MSmits: nice
 DomiKo: 7amasa  not me but yes
 7amasa: thats pretty cool, thanks
 ZarthaxX: ClockSort simultaneous mcts?
 Magus: ClockSort: according to the time used by opponents, no one in top 5 is just with heuristics
 Magus: Or maybe they used an heuristic that takes 100ms to return a result
 Wontonimo: ( i'll add wait(.98) to my heuristic to make it seem like a sim )
 Westicles: slamo at 24 probably the highest
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: (not no to you Westicles, no to my comment)
 Magus: I can assure you that I'm not with just heuristics :D
 RoboStac: theres a perl user at 19 who probably isn't a sim
 slamo: magus to confirm
 Michael_Howard: Roast my bot please! Can someone tell me specifically what it's doing so horribly wrong? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555462322">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555462322</a>
 Michael_Howard: I've had my head in technical details so much I've lost sight of the fundamentals.
 Michael_Howard: Seems to come down to falling behind in sun earnings in mid game.
 MSmits: poor seeding from frame 28
 MSmits: next to your own trees
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555467971">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555467971</a>
 RoboStac: you keep up pretty well on sun until day 12. The start of day 12 is horrible for you (5 sun vs 20 for him)
 Noyotens: why my function work just in first round
 RoboStac: and then you let him claim a lot of nutrient bonuses but still stay behind / equal on sun per day
 Michael_Howard: MSmits thanks, yeah that's messed up.
 Michael_Howard: RoboStac yeah he completes more because he's just building more because he gets more sun. Seems to be winning the shadow war but I'm not sure why.
 Michael_Howard: Thanks.
 Illedan: Shadows is the fow of this game :O
 RoboStac: yeah, you basically just lose on start of day 12(frame 67) due to shadows
 dbf: how are you able to catch an issue in replay in such details, I'm watching games and still can't figure out who is leading now and why...
 Astrobytes: dbf: debug mode?
 MSmits: poor seeding is easy to see unless it's poor because of shadows
 RoboStac: downloaded the replay json and printed all the strings with 'collected x sun points' and then went to look at the days where there was a big difference
 MSmits: seems like i have 50% vs boss, but I cant get to him :P
 Illedan: Finally some chance
 MSmits: nice one Illy, you're gonna make it
 MSmits: if not in this life, then the next
 MSmits: i mean submit, not life
 Nerchio: :thinking:
 Illedan: Should work and I can start on my new thing in peace
 MSmits: your new thing?
 MSmits: is this a contest thing or are you dropping the contest after legend&gt;?
 Illedan: Next contest algo
 Illedan: this GA is not kicking it
 MSmits: it's kicking the bucket
 MSmits: my current submit won first 16 games
 Smelty: yes lets go 1224/1292 in gold
 MSmits: hope it's not a fluke
 Smelty: lol
 MSmits: lost 17th&#160;:(
 Smelty: F
 Magus: (I'm still amazed when I see Nerchio in a codingame contest .... :D )
 Nerchio: :nerd:
 Nerchio: its like people can do more than 1 thing in life :D
 Illedan: ^
 Illedan: Like I can drink beer and code
 Astrobytes: I can drink beer and code. Very well in fact. I just never use that code.
 theycallmedavid: Well if you already drank it
 reCurse: Something something ballmer peak
 Astrobytes: ^
 alchemsti: ooh, iledan you are above the gold boss, I see
 xMistySenpai: buncha moderators dang
 Illedan: Correct
 Illedan: Lose streak inc :tada:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: on the cusp of gold
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 Astrobytes: I'll give you a tentative 'looking good' on that submit Illedan
 Chainman: Can't sleep till beat bossooot
 Marchete: congrats ille
 ClockSort: i can beat the boss 1v1 most of the time, but can't reach him&#160;:(
 Michael_Howard: That means you're playing him too much.
 Michael_Howard: You're overfitting your strategy.
 Michael_Howard: Practice on other high-ups.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: .08 ... smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: .04
 Illedan: I guess allowing to use Seeds after round 14 helps :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: promoted, yeah!
 ClockSort: congrats!!
 Astrobytes: Illedan: you didn't allow seeds after round 14?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan goes legend i c
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: Now I only allow to plant if there is 0 lvl 0 trees in play
 Astrobytes: Seems sensible
 PatrickMcGinnisII: free seeds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup
 jacek: round = day?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Illedan: Ye
 Astrobytes: Turn on debug mode, it's what they call them
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: So many losses
 gameJammer10: Ive lost so many times
 BrunoFelthes: what is the most important thing to win gold boss?
 Illedan: Get the most points?
 Illedan: Sun is about 33% as important
 BrunoFelthes: but, get more sun points at the start is important?
 Illedan: Get the most possible income as fast as possible
 Illedan: and I dont allow any selling before round 12
 lowzhao: Can we make more than 1 move in an iteration?
 struct: no
 dbf: depends on your definition of 'iteration'
 lowzhao: because i see that the opponent can COMPLETE so many trees
 lowzhao: what is the format of doing this?
 lowzhao: print multiple lines?
 jacek: print one action per loop iteration
 jacek: the day isnt over until both players are waiting
 pmor: 1 day = 1 round.  There are multiple turns per round.
 Astrobytes: ^
 lowzhao: how to complete multiple trees at once?
 jacek: he doesnt do 'at once'
 lowzhao: oh
 lowzhao: if you wait you loses the chance to play that round?
 jacek: yes
 Illedan: struct, you dragged me down&#160;:(
 struct: sorry&#160;:(
 lowzhao: thank you!
 MSmits: drag me up 
 ZarthaxX: gogo structo
 ZarthaxX: and Illedan&#160;:*
 Illedan: 1 hour+ submit just for a broken dream
 struct: lol
 MSmits: maybe when you go to bed, you're legend when you wake up
 Illedan: Don't give me hopes
 struct: just resubmit :p
 dbf: just setup a resubmit script once an hour
 Illedan: And resub on 95&#160;% every time?
 struct: :pray:
 struct: no battles vs the boss...
 MSmits: I'm rank 24 now, just short of getting battles with it
 MSmits: 22
 MSmits: 19
 MSmits: is it just me or do most battles seem really close
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: vs boss, but also in top of gold
 struct: I lost vs him
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: I'll just wait here for struct to leave the building
 struct: .05 away from not deleting
 struct:&#160;:/
 MSmits: you should just stay there struct
 elderlybeginner: do you consider amount of neighors when seeding?
 MSmits: yay
 MSmits: it happened struct
 struct: its done
 struct: Thanks
 struct: I think its my first legend on a contest
 Scarfield: :muscle:&#160;!
 MSmits: really wow, grats!
 MSmits: first of many
 Illedan: 0.03 :scream:
 struct: thanks
 struct: you got this Illedan
 MSmits: it could be worse Illedan, it could be smaller than 0.01
 Illedan: You won me 7!! times
 struct: lol
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Illedan: Let's not go down that path MSmits. Don't want to open wounds
 ZarthaxX: GZZ STRUCTTTT
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 struct: thanks
 Illedan: FINALLY
 jacek: struttt?
 ZarthaxX: GZZZ Illedan
 Illedan: Cya next contest
 MSmits: grats Illedan
 ZarthaxX: bai
 Illedan: Jk, no sleep before above euler
 MSmits: I think i am just gonna push everyone out of gold so i can get some games vs boss
 struct: MSmits you also improved a lot on  last few days
 Marchete: congrats
 MSmits: mostly yesterday, today, a little yes
 struct: now you win Illedan
 struct: lol
 struct: grats
 MSmits: but mostly by just randomly coding stuff and hope it sticks
 Illedan: Stay down struct :P
 MSmits: it's like this. Hmm somehow my bot likes to complete a whole bunch of trees at once. What to change to avoid this? It's so difficult to solve that sort of thing with a search eval
 WolfDarrigan: what's wrong with completing them all at once?
 MSmits: because then you have no income
 MSmits: i mean like 5 days before the end
 MSmits: or more
 WolfDarrigan: oh, it is doing it early in the game, not at the end
 MSmits: well not early
 MSmits: it's just better to gradually complete them
 MSmits: so you keep a steady income
 elderlybeginner: if you are using scoring function you can add a factor for amount of 3 size trees
 WolfDarrigan: I include sun in my scoring of a board state
 MSmits: I do too
 WolfDarrigan: hmm
 MSmits: elderlybeginner sure, i have stuff like that
 MSmits: it's just hard to tweak
 Rium: when debugging my code with console.error.writeline(), is there any way to get all the messages written? Currently it skips some in the middle during execution.
 elderlybeginner: then change the factors and add a turn to complete, I cut more at the end
 Scarfield: penalty on points gained above some threshold?
 MSmits: Scarfield, i thought of that but seems messy, then you need to take into account when it was gained
 MSmits: you also still need the score for endgame eval
 Scarfield: ye
 MSmits: also, as bots get better, it gets harder to actually see whats going wrong
 MSmits: you fix one assumed error and cause another
 ddreams: gz struct
 MSmits: I remember being in this situation in ooc
 MSmits: having a hard time getting out of gold
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: but there i had a todo list, every feature i added made bot better. Here I am grasping at straws
 elderlybeginner: any idea for future shadow in scoring function for complete and grow?
 MSmits: I have that
 MSmits: calculate future sun income
 MSmits: till end of game
 MSmits: oh, i should try a decay
 Illedan: I have reversed decay :D
 ddreams: I've spent hours trying to make decay work... can't manage to improve
 MSmits: Illedan huh? Why?
 elderlybeginner: it's not static, so compuing till the end is useless
 Enknable: I think you gotta create a [4*completedTrees - nextSunPoints(completedTrees)]
 ddreams: maybe I should do that
 Enknable: or something lol
 Scarfield: points gained later means more suns to spend i suppose
 Illedan: Nice to see other Norweigans around ddreams&#160;:)
 ddreams: elderlybeginner definitely not useless
 MSmits: I keep going up the leaderboard from other players submitting
 ddreams: yeah, I you're in the Oslo area too?
 MSmits: 8 now
 pardouin: 21 python in legend :o
 Illedan: Yeah
 pardouin: most of them only with heuristics or very light simu
 pardouin: I'm envious&#160;:'(
 MSmits: I think it's cool that many approaches work in this game
 pardouin: my heuristic "clever ideas" all fail miserably4
 MSmits: just wish I knew what i was doing&#160;:)
 MSmits: same pardouin
 Westicles: Just read the chat logs for the last week, it is all clever and helpful analysis
 elderlybeginner: I guess that the main difficulty in this contest is to find what's not working. I cannot find mistakes looking into board
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: but also fixing the things that are not working&#160;:)
 OlivierRivoyre: Since I fix a computation error on my program, it works worst&#160;;(
 MSmits: thats really annoying, happens rarely, but it's the worst thing
 MSmits: being forced to keep a bug
 elderlybeginner: any idea what's going wrong?I use only scoring function and no future shadow implemented<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555515215">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555515215</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits bewats me by like 6 pnts, but hes at top of leaderboard and i'm at bottom, this contest is close...like every little detail matters, but every detail cost time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bewats=beats
 Astrobytes: I prefer bewat
 reCurse: berates?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: webats
 MSmits: yeah it's all quite close
 MSmits: elderlybeginner it's mostly shadows i think
 MSmits: somehow he gets more suns
 MSmits: but thats hard to spot
 MSmits: so you need shadow prediction and such
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I calculate who to grow by the current potential over the next min(23-days,6)
 Scarfield: AstroBewats
 PatrickMcGinnisII: w/ shadows
 MSmits: yeah those are nice heuristics PatrickMcGinnisII, but hard to use in a search
 MSmits: because a heuristic to choose an action is different from one to eval a state
 Illedan: How is barely beating Gold boss top 40 in Legend -.-
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 elderlybeginner: you put "shadow points" in scoring every action?
 MSmits: Illedan it's always like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's how I prune grows in midgame
 PatrickMcGinnisII: seeds is a different matter
 ClockSort: what do i put at the top of my c++ program in order to make it very fast? something like
 MindController: #pragma GCC optimize("-O3,inline,omit-frame-pointer,unroll-loops")
 MSmits: elderlybeginner i dont score actions, i score states, but it's a search so thats different
 Marchete: let's go JRFerguson!
 ClockSort: @MindController thanks. do you know if htat works for MSVC++ too?
 Zenoscave: to legend?
 Illedan: Marchete close too?
 reCurse: No, you control the compiler options in MSVC
 Astrobytes: ClockSort: You set those in your project settings in MSVC
 ClockSort: thanks
 Astrobytes: ah, recurse got there already
 reCurse: It's ok I still need my translator
 ClockSort: i  am using msvc++ locally and the differences are annoying :D
 Astrobytes: And set to release
 elderlybeginner: MSmith I'm purely on logic and evaluation of each action with minimal code
 reCurse: Your hardware may not match CG's at all
 Astrobytes: reCurse :D
 MSmits: yes i know, it's quite effective elderlybeginner
 ClockSort: I am seeing 3x speed improvement over not-using-pragma. is that typical?
 ClockSort: (on CG)
 reCurse: Yes
 ClockSort: :O
 Zenoscave: yup
 ClockSort: hello Legend :D
 Astrobytes: 100% yes
 ClockSort: (maybe)
 Astrobytes: It's compiled with no optimisations
 Zenoscave: clock sort let me know when you submit. I want to test against
 ClockSort: submitting now
 Westicles: 10 minutes later... I made my code 3x faster and I dropped 1000 places
 ClockSort: same bot that was #100 gold after a couple hours, but now with #pragma
 MSmits: it's still mcts ClockSort?
 ClockSort: yes, just 9000 rollouts from round 9 to end-of-game though
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: so few!
 reCurse: totoro search
 pardouin: it seems that gold boss was actually a #30 player but his first run was especially bad and ~100 players made the cut
 pardouin: so it's not surprising that people can jump form gold to top 30
 pardouin: from*
 abenner: are bitboards worth it for this game
 ClockSort: what do you mean, "totoro search"
 MSmits: it's mostly that gold boss tends to get boosted after a while in gold league
 MSmits: meaning it takes more effort to pass it
 MSmits: then when you finally manage it, your bot is strong
 Noyotens:                                <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555532292">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555532292</a>       
 reCurse: Whoever wins should name their algo totoro search
 pardouin: ^^
 Zenoscave: But beam search already has a name
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: not that beam will win ...
 ClockSort: thanks for the help guys, let's see how 3x speed improvement helps MCTS.
 Illedan: Beam wont win
 ClockSort: seems like going from 3000 rollouts to 9000 would be really valuable since it's a low number either way
 BrunoFelthes: what are you using illedan?
 Illedan: GA
 alchemsti: Why do you say that? I think beam would win
 Zenoscave: Really ille?
 ZarthaxX: when did agad e appear?
 alchemsti: But it would be a fairly narrow one with a fairly expensive eval
 Illedan: Ye
 BrunoFelthes: wow...
 BrunoFelthes: for you and your opponent?
 Illedan: SGA to be precice..
 Illedan: mhm
 BrunoFelthes: but, when you change a "gene", you can invalidate the role game... no?
 Illedan: Hence I evolve them at the same time
 Zenoscave: Not if you don't make that a valid gene change&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: elderlybeginner looks like u cut first tree too early,  when cost to grow tree of size 3 &gt; 10, then cut is great, but the 1 sun you are saving isn't worth it, cause your losing 9 sun over next 3 days... wtf do i know
 actualCoderTrevor: Illedan what's the "S" in SGA?
 Illedan: simultaneous
 ClockSort: SuperDuper
 actualCoderTrevor: ohhh thanks
 BrunoFelthes: I'm really curious how to do it... 
 MSmits: Illedan that's like smitsimax isnt it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i thought u said SCA Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)
 Illedan: Yeah, just worse and faster to write :D
 actualCoderTrevor: Illedan if you don't mind my asking how do you enforce the rules with GA? Just force your algorithm to choose one of the available moves with modulo?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: who did an NN?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Two contests in a row Illedan!
 struct: true AI will win
 BrunoFelthes: You have a population, play a game until the end, cross, 2 good choices, if it is not valid, you discard it?
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh nice
 Illedan: It is never invalid
 Illedan: 2 days x 4 actions. Each action a doublePrecalc possible actions and do val*actions to select. If not valid =&gt; "wait"
 Westicles: GAimax w/ Prune Array is all you need
 MSmits: Illedan i thought it was depth 4?
 Zenoscave: PruneArrays are op
 BrunoFelthes: it is only 2 days?
 Illedan: My search yeah
 BrunoFelthes: OMG
 BrunoFelthes: and you are legend with 2 days search
 BrunoFelthes: My search is a crap
 MSmits: there are legend with 0 days search
 struct: meanwhile im at 24 days
 BrunoFelthes: really?
 Illedan: Guess it took them a day to write the search?
 MSmits: yeah many heuristic bots
 BrunoFelthes: but, i really dont know how to eval what is the best board only 2 days after
 BrunoFelthes: the board with the best sun?
 Illedan: Least overlapping sun
 BrunoFelthes: considering the first 15 turns
 MindController: Incoming sun generation imo
 BrunoFelthes: I will try it
 Astrobytes: Yeah, she really killed it in '78
 Astrobytes: woops
 Astrobytes: wrong window
 MindController: Also does anyone know why is there so much fights in gold?
 MindController: 5h ago 90 fights were full sumbin
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes LOL
 MindController: Now im 85 fights in only at 65%
 actualCoderTrevor: Woah but now my curiosity is piqued. Who liked what in '78??
 Astrobytes: Donna Jean Godchaux
 actualCoderTrevor: I sense I'll never have the answer
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh I have half the answer
 Zenoscave: you're a dead head
 Astrobytes: Sang great with the Grateful Dead that year
 Westicles: PMs about how much you Thatcher?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Westicles: love
 actualCoderTrevor: Okay lol thanks
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnVCxqBFawQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnVCxqBFawQ</a>
 Zenoscave: cool
 actualCoderTrevor: I'm grateful to have my answer
 Zenoscave: If I'm doing '78 I'm doing dire straits
 Westicles: Astrobytes the gov't told us we can all toss our masks, and these people are still driving around alone with masks on
 Astrobytes: And?
 Westicles: I'm living with a bunch of crazy people?
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: Fair. I love the dead from beginning to about 77 mostly, but there's a lot of good stuff up to about '84
 actualCoderTrevor: The gov't said that if you're vaccinated, which only 40% of people are, and there's research to suggest if you're immunosuppressed the vaccines are less effective
 Zenoscave: But we all rest in P.Funk right astro?&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: 100%
 actualCoderTrevor: ^
 lastshamp: :poop:
 Astrobytes: How anyone can claim this music as bad however is beyond me
 Noyotens: :rage::rage::rage:
 Zenoscave: I mean it's good, but it isn't N*SYNC good /s
 SirLoxley: Does anybody know the stack size of C++ runtimes in codinggame? Do I get the full 700MB?
 Counterbalance: stack is a few mb
 Zenoscave: I doubt it's that large SirLoxley
 Astrobytes: you can check it via bash
 Counterbalance: heap = 768mb - stack - program size
 SirLoxley: darn. I wanted to avoid putting stuff on the heap
 Marchete: you can change stack on c++
 Marchete: via code
 Marchete: based on a true history
 xMistySenpai: im disgusted with how most if not all example codes use var
 xMistySenpai: let exists as a viable replacement
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/RN_Explorer/blob/main/src/solorunner/RN_ExploDiv_7.cpp#L4703-L4724">https://github.com/marchete/RN_Explorer/blob/main/src/solorunner/RN_ExploDiv_7.cpp#L4703-L4724</a>
 JSboss: ive got no problem with Var, it's the "const" default in CoC that really grinds my gears
 JSboss: because then if you need to change or increment an input in fastest mode, well gg
 xMistySenpai: var is deprecated and garbage towards the engine'
 JSboss: source lol&#160;?
 Stormalix: JSboss ikrr!
 JSboss: yes it requires hoisting but it is also backwards compatability ensuring and deffo not deprecated
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: fungusuas goodasufugu seems remarkably on that PF wavelength
 xMistySenpai: if you need backwards compatibility
 xMistySenpai: then why use const
 SirLoxley: wow. Someone wrote an essay on a coding-game problem. My respect
 xMistySenpai: kinda lopsided
 JSboss: i am arguing against the use of const as a default in CoC, not the opposite
 Zenoscave: astro link? Can't find
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnVCxqBFawQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnVCxqBFawQ</a>
 Astrobytes: scroll up in the chat
 xMistySenpai: ik but if const then why not let
 xMistySenpai: thats my opinion
 JSboss: ah yea i agree let would be optimal,
 actualCoderTrevor: You're both talking about the boilerplate code when you start a new contest / puzzle?
 JSboss: yes exactly, in JS
 Maliamnon: First gold this time around. Might try to crack top 500 this weekend if the weather isn't too perfect
 actualCoderTrevor: I guess that could be annoying in CoC
 Westicles: You should try c++.  By the time you tokenize the strings everyone else is gone
 JSboss: :D
 Astrobytes: heh heh not wrong
 Zenoscave: or ruby and you can try winning more often
 Zenoscave: or perl depending
 JSboss: yes, js+ruby = top 20 CoC&#160;:)
 JSboss: perl is too much for me
 Astrobytes: cryptic ruby is harder to read than cryptic perl imo
 Zenoscave: lol I write some real cryptic ruby
 MSmits: so ruby is a natural obfuscation language?
 JSboss: $_ and ~/$/ are favs
 Zenoscave: chmod 333 *.rb
 JSboss: also all this
 JSboss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.zenspider.com/ruby/quickref.html">https://www.zenspider.com/ruby/quickref.html</a>
 Astrobytes: But can you write poetry in rb
 MSmits: better use shakespear for that

 JSboss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.zenspider.com/ruby/quickref.html#pseudo-variables">https://www.zenspider.com/ruby/quickref.html#pseudo-variables</a>this helped
 reCurse: That guy writing a bot in perl is running into real risks of being disqualified for obfuscation
 Astrobytes: MSmits you never read perl poetry?
 Zenoscave: Is it actual perl or a wrapper?
 reCurse: (or person, my bad)
 MSmits: nope, i know you dont think I have a life, but, mmh nvm, show me
 NinjaDoggy: oh my...
 NinjaDoggy: I just found a tragic bug&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: don't make me letmegooglethat for you
 ZarthaxX: wtf NinjaDoggy lol
 MSmits: aww right, i'll do it myself
 NinjaDoggy: I'm running my new bot locally and it wins 70%+ against old bot
 Queuebee: what do the scores signify in the leaderboard?
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Zenoscave: lmgtfy.com/?q=perl+poetry
 ClockSort: how can you have a tragic bug and already be so strong?
 ZarthaxX: what bug
 NinjaDoggy: I run it on CG and it's &lt; 40% ... wtf?
 NinjaDoggy: turns out locally
 NinjaDoggy: I don't generate sun for day 0
 reCurse: Some legend says vorgons use perl as their language to write every program
 NinjaDoggy: so it's basically playing with 1 less day...
 NinjaDoggy: thus the constants are inproperly optimized 
 NinjaDoggy: i ran it for the whole night too T_T
 ClockSort: hey, i might have that problem too lol
 natofp: hey guys how do you test your bots locally?
 NinjaDoggy: I wrote my own arena thing
 NinjaDoggy: but brutal tester is pretty popular
 reCurse: Did I say vorgon, I meant vogon. Geez.
 reCurse: Uncreative writers I swear
 natofp: can you elaborate? can i download this brutal tester from somewhere?
 NinjaDoggy: um... I've never used it personally so someone else can probably help you more

 reCurse: Never gets old
 Nerchio: i see maybe i win vs the guys around my rank but lose vs everyone above
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 Zenoscave: I think trueskill is an improvement on many ranking system for it's purpose
 Astrobytes: It's a meme that will sadly never die I fear reCurse
 reCurse: Nerchio: Seems like that's what's happening, also top guys tend to submit a lot so they are overrepresented
 reCurse: Top persons geez, gonna get fired at this rate
 Astrobytes: :P
 Westicles: The one girl here appreciates the effort, I'm sure
 Zenoscave: fired from ubisoft?
 reCurse: I dunno, maybe
 Westicles: Except she got banned...
 Zenoscave: * &lt;--- the point
 reCurse: Worse has happened over less
 Astrobytes: There are other girls too Westicles but you don't know them
 Westicles: oh right, orange vixen
 Astrobytes: Many others.
 actualCoderTrevor: #1 in gold is "Jessie" with a Princess Peach avatar, though I suppose that's not definitive

 Zenoscave: Ah yes, the american aggressive greeting 
 Astrobytes: Do one Zeno! (I find it amusing how you've totally picked up this phrase btw)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Here, hold my beer
 Westicles: They changed the definition of guy to be gender neutral, so you are okay
 reCurse: That one flew over my head
 Zenoscave: (I lvoe the phrase)
 Zenoscave: I love it too
 Astrobytes: :D
 Westicles: used in plural to refer to the members of a group regardless of sex
 Zenoscave: I that what was dudes
 reCurse: Is it now?
 reCurse: Is it also something I want to risk?
 Zenoscave: reCurse not used by all.
 Lysk: yeah that's all good until you ask "how many dudes/guys you slept with?" suddenly not so neutral for many
 reCurse: lol
 Zenoscave: only for direct reference preceeded by "you" i.e. What are you guys doing?
 Zenoscave: y'all works better
 reCurse: Aaaand that's why I'll stick to person

 Astrobytes: we have 'youse'
 Astrobytes: Always have 
 Zenoscave: how the hell do you pronounce 'youse'

 Lysk: Astrobytes, that depends where in the usa you are 
 reCurse: That reads as dirty as it sounds like

 Westicles: Wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie, O, what a panic's in thy breastie! 
 Astrobytes: MSmits: are you ill?
 Astrobytes: Ah, tae a moose
 Astrobytes: I always liked the puddock tae
 MSmits: nope
 Zenoscave: I've got nothing to add to weird soundin english
 Zenoscave: I live in the Man'ains
 Astrobytes: For clarity: Tae a Moose (To a Mouse) and The Puddock (The Frog) are both Robert Burns poems
 alchemsti: Wee sleekit tim'rus Beastie
 alchemsti: Oh what a panic's in thy breastie
 Astrobytes: Who is somehow the Scottish national poet thing because .... a few good songs and poems, massively drunken, womanising arse though
 alchemsti: I think he was one of the first to write poetry in commonly spoken Scottish
 Zenoscave: TIL
 alchemsti: Random trivia -- "Of Mice and Men" (Steinbeck, also a movie)
 Astrobytes: I walked along a path somewhere up near Pitlochry (I think) and there was a stone sign in a bush that said "Robert Burns slept here"
 alchemsti: is from that poem
 alchemsti: of a mouse, whose house gets destroyed by a plow
 alchemsti: with he line
 alchemsti: The best laid schemes o' mice and men
 Astrobytes: gang aft awry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he found ransomware in the bush and made $5M
 Astrobytes: *agley
 Astrobytes: same word
 Zenoscave: who did PatrickMcGinnisII?
 alchemsti: As you can see, I don't want to work on my stupid program
 alchemsti: because it's broken in multiple ways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: whoever, watching news about rusky pipeline
 Lysk: between pipeline with no cyber security and social security &amp; tax written in kobol, so many things can go wrong
 Astrobytes: More concerned about a certain Middle Eastern conflict tbh, but still tweaking my bot
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII
 Zenoscave: I need to find a reliable newsource. I don't have cable/tv
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Gaza doesn't affect me much, but no diesel at gas stations 'cause every1 freaked out
 Lysk: reddit is a very serious source
 Westicles: waiting for the /s
 Nerchio: a lot of discussion with chinese bots
 Nerchio: sounds fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "/r chubbychicks doesn't count"
 Astrobytes: I generally use theguardian.com, opinion articles are from all sides of anything, sources are linked - if not you email them and get them
 NinjaDoggy: I fixed my arena bug but my new bot(which performs worse) still beats my new bot 2:1 locally&#160;:(
 CharmyRosewolf: How did I open up the game and suddenly I'm in gold :scream:
 Zenoscave: good to know Astrobytes!
 NinjaDoggy: guess it's time to look into brutal tester or something for sanity checking
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I would trust you guys from other countries than my US news
 Zenoscave: ^^^
 NinjaDoggy: Zenoscave brutal tester works out of the box with this contest right?
 Zenoscave: Nope. use magu_s fork of my fork
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 NinjaDoggy: ok thanks!
 Zenoscave: mvn package. and you're good to go
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: It's a liberal-leaning (in the British sense - well the past British sense compared to right now) paper but takes and publishes articles from all side, I just repeated myself but I will console myself with nice music
 alchemsti: So just resubmitted code from like 3 days ago because everything I've done since then has been broken or bad.
 alchemsti: Such a shitty feeling
 Astrobytes: Standard CG contest stuff, don't worry
 Zenoscave: alchemsti I think I've got between 100+ submits maybe 10 different versions 
 MSmits: how do you target boss again with cg bench?&gt;
 MSmits: it's more convenient than ide anyways
 Astrobytes: -1 id?
 MSmits: i thought so, but not sure
 reCurse: Careful not to hit limits
 MSmits: i set 60 s
 Astrobytes: been a while since I did that, you have the same limit anyway though so why bother
 alchemsti: I don't mind so much the many submits, it's the frustration of having bugs / things not behaving as they should. I guess it's a lesson in not cutting corners. I have some basic verification tests, but should have more, I think.
 MSmits: Astrobytes because it counts for me&#160;:)
 MSmits: so i know wr, even if its poor statistics
 Astrobytes: Why bother anyway?

 alchemsti: Y'all have a good night!
 Astrobytes: Sorry, jaded Friday
 Astrobytes: There's a 5cm (about 2") mean black spider above my desk. It's been sat there for an hour.
 pmor: spiderbro
 struct: :scream:
 Astrobytes: It seems pretty chill
 struct: burn the house
 ZarthaxX: it's a spy!
 Astrobytes: It looks evil. I don't mind spiders at all but this one looks intimidating even to me.
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: i'm sure it's ok
 MSmits: as long as you stare right at it and dont blink
 Westicles: I had one that would rappel down from the ceiling and bite me every night.  They ain't all bros
 Astrobytes: It was up on the ceiling earlier
 struct: nightmare fuel for me&#160;:(
 Westicles: put on the hazmat suit before bed
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvCI-gNK_y4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvCI-gNK_y4</a>
 Astrobytes: Only time I ever had spider bites was when my ex came back from France and was complaining of bites. A few times over at her place and I was the same. Coming home on the subway one morning  a very large brown spider comes running out my cardigan sleeve
 Zenoscave: yeeesh
 Zenoscave: that's terrifying
 Astrobytes: Scared the actual bejesus out of several passengers, they stamped their feet - now tell me what did the spider do?
 Zenoscave: live
 Astrobytes: It ran up my fking leg!
 Zenoscave: but instinct is instinct
 pmor: ya'll need some wolf spiders in your life
 Astrobytes: I've never thrown a spider as far as I did that time
 struct: no thanks
 Westicles: "It is estimated that there are up to one million spiders per acre of land on earth"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: spiders lol
 Zenoscave: We have brown recluse and black widows native to where I live
 Astrobytes: I really like them. They can be disturbing but they are cool generally.
 Astrobytes: Black Widows defo worse than Brown Recluse, though the latter bites can get infected and be pretty shit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have lots of them, there are good spiders and bad spiders...we have brown recluse and black widows that can mess you up,  but more common are the daddy long legs and wolf spiders which kill alot of bugs...I have no bugs other than spiders.  Fl is full of bugs...this is mosquito and love bug season.  Most of yall r prolly pretty lucky.
 Zenoscave: We also have an annual fall tarantula migration

 Nerchio: im fine with spiders just not the dangerous ones or fat ones xD
 pmor: love bugs need to burn in hell
 Zenoscave: Queuebee use 1ul not 1
 Zenoscave: signed int vs unsigned long constant
 Queuebee: but I need 64 bits from the beginning
 Zenoscave: x |= 1ul &lt;&lt; 31;
 Queuebee: okayyy :O
 Queuebee: 1l works too :D
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Queuebee: thankyouuuuu :D
 Zenoscave: for &gt;&gt; shifts does 1 work?
 Zenoscave: 1l*
 Queuebee: No clue, I'm not there yet Lol
 ZarthaxX: UL or ULL?
 ZarthaxX: i always use ULL
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Queuebee looks like 2s complement, need unsigned long i think
 pmor: 64b you would want ull
 Queuebee: its c#
 ZarthaxX: right
 Queuebee: does that exist
 Zenoscave: depends on ABI, no? This is above my paygrade
 ZarthaxX: haha
 Astrobytes: lol
 Queuebee: my IDE goes brrrrrrrt on ull
 ZarthaxX: f
 pmor: c# i don't have much experience with.
 pmor: they might do things differently than c/c++
 Queuebee: actually Zenoscave using ulong the Conver.ToString(x, 2); breaks
 struct: Zenoscave I see that you compiled the referee
 Westicles: No telling what they do in C#... you know who came up with that
 struct: How do I run it?
 Zenoscave: java -jar no flags "should " work

 Astrobytes: Right. I'm out. I'll listen to the rest of this dead show and put my feet up
 cegprakash: damn
 Astrobytes: See ya all tomorrow
 cegprakash: I get 5000 simulations at depth 1
 cegprakash: too bad
 ZarthaxX: depth 1?
 ZarthaxX: day 1?
 cegprakash: yep
 cegprakash: day1
 ZarthaxX: ah
 cegprakash: let me see profiler to see if I can improve performance
 ClockSort: 3x speed (pragma O3) made my bot drop 70 ranks. luck, or is there a downside?
 Zenoscave: Accuracy of eval?
 Zenoscave: Westicles you called it
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Wontonimo: Legend is up to 115 ... I'm starting to feel left out 
 cegprakash: my profiler is not collecting any data in visual studio 2017 not sure if I'm doing it right
 Wontonimo: can't we all be winners?
 ZarthaxX: nope
 ZarthaxX: you are a loser wonto, im sorry
 cegprakash: this is the report generated by my VS <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/9VY6NTy">https://ibb.co/9VY6NTy</a> no idea what I'm doing wrong.. does anyone use profiler?
 ZarthaxX: legend isnt everything anyway
 ZarthaxX: you learned a lot wonto :D
 ZarthaxX: and will prob smash me soon
 ZarthaxX: :c
 Zenoscave: My IDE bot is 2x as slow compared to facing arena bot. Is IDE having issues?
 Wontonimo: there is still time for smashing ZarthaxX watch your toes
 ZarthaxX: i know
 ZarthaxX: and you will prob do
 ZarthaxX: i will just delete account before you get me&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: Winners never quit, and quitters never win, but those who never win and never quit are idiots
 Wontonimo: oh ... just checked your rank ... you can rest easy ZarthaxX, my boots are no wear near your toes
 ZarthaxX: my rank is a lie tho
 ZarthaxX: legend is messy
 struct: ZarthaxX hiding
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: i have a big fat bot here 
 ZarthaxX: will reveal it soon (?
 XeroOl: hahaha I have completed my profile and got all of the certifications
 ZarthaxX: good
 Wontonimo: congrats XeroOl&#160;!
 ZarthaxX: now delete account and do it again
 XeroOl: lmao
 Wontonimo: prestige 
 ZarthaxX: the struct way
 ZarthaxX: :D
 XeroOl: now I have to do all the achievements
 Wontonimo: how long did it take you XeroOl&#160;?
 XeroOl: is there a way to know how long I've had the account?
 Wontonimo: about april 8th
 XeroOl: joined on 8th of april, yeah
 Wontonimo: 4 u
 XeroOl: so little over a month
 Wontonimo: well, that's a speed run
 Wontonimo: are you unemployed&#160;?
 XeroOl: lmao
 XeroOl: I'm a student
 XeroOl: and online classes suck
 Wontonimo: i'm starting to question my abilities
 XeroOl: please hire me thanks lol
 Wontonimo: (Wonto repeats to himself "we are all winners, we are all winners")
 XeroOl: meanwhile, I'm at silver in the competition, and I don't see any good hope of getting highe
 XeroOl: ]r
 xMistySenpai: range of 4 means a 9 including center, right?
 Queuebee: why is everyone always talking about using unsinged thingies, is it faster?
 alchemsti: it's generally nicer for bit operations.
 XeroOl: how do you guys compute the distances for each tile
 alchemsti: E.g. when you right shift signed things, you have to worry about sign extension
 Queuebee: hmm
 Queuebee: I dont have right shifts yet .__.
 Queuebee: I hope it wont be hard to refactor all longs into ulongs when it comes to that
 XeroOl: maybe learning rust and writing a sim at the same time is a bad idea
 XeroOl: lol
 Noyotens: i am dont want win but what is the prize
 yyzl: 有人吗
 Whiskee: are you ever really really proud of some piece of eval logic and then remove it just to check the performance impact and see that it made no difference whatsoever in the first place
 Whiskee: worst feeling every time.
 XeroOl: lol
 Nerchio: pretty normal i'd say
 XeroOl: the secret is that I never actually check performance
 XeroOl: I just write code that "feels" fast
 XeroOl:&#160;:(
 reCurse: Secret to what
 pmor: I'm still trying to get my valid actions logic performant&#160;:(.  I haven't even begun to work on eval yet.
 XeroOl: lmao I've given up on efficiency at this point
 XeroOl: I just want it to work, and be a simulator
 XeroOl: and be done before the comp is over
 pmor: after day 15 i can't even sim 1 day.
 XeroOl: time to look up a tutorial on beam search lol
 XeroOl: I've got my sim code "finished" but completely untested
 XeroOl: wait, beam search needs a heuristic
 pmor: this is beam search :sob:
 XeroOl: why does this challenge need so much heuristics&#160;!!!!!
 XeroOl: I want to just not think today lol
 cegprakash: wait wuut
 cegprakash: I changed string to enum and I got from 5K sims to 82K sims
 Numby: now change to ints gonna go to 150k sims lol
 struct: you were using strings?
 cegprakash: int is faster than enum? Numby
 cegprakash: struct yes for Move types
 Numby: I'm not sure for C++ but in java structs are bit heavyweight since they're objects and this can make a difference in some cases
 Numby: I've seen Android developers avoid using Enums due to avoid memory bloat
 Kukiss: Finally gettin closer to gold&#160;:)All evening was trying to make a use from my stored info about shadows
 develoore: enums are true about android development
 develoore: but in c++ they are basically ints
 Numby: can c++ enums act as classes or they're plain enums same as C?
 develoore: also unless classes/structs (they are the same thing) contain virtual functions they are pretty much just data containers on steroids (just a few pointers in them)
 develoore: enums act like classes
 develoore: but at compile time that info is lost
 Numby: But I guess the issue is in java generally everything is pointer which is the issue. Like in C++ you can have an array of some class, in java it's all an array of pointers
 natofp: Anyone knows how to fix that in brutaltester? Error: 02:47:44,725 ERROR [com.magusgeek.brutaltester.GameThread] Problem with referee output in game1. Output content:WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.
 develoore: well, it's more about having everything with virtual functions and having their types baked in
 develoore: in c++ casting (dynamic cast) is really costy
 develoore: in java not that much since the object's type is stored along the object in the memory
 develoore: of course if you have a lot of small objects it will make a huge difference
 develoore: but these are all premature optimizations and only matter when there's really nothing else one can improve on the algorithm itself&#160;:)
 Lysk: which version of java are you using?
 Numby: Don't think there's a choice. But should be at least java 8 (too lazy to look around the website , this info is somewhere)
 Kukiss: probably <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: They're running offline&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: not on CG
 Zenoscave: natofp that error is safe to ignore. it is due to The reflection library used in the engine. should not effect your games
 Zenoscave: sadly it makes a lot of noise
 Kukiss: then oops 
 Noyotens: i deafet the bot 10/10 and my rank is 58 and i am not in silver
 Wontonimo: it's not about the bot, it's what between you and the bot.  lots of different strats in there
 Wontonimo: pick a few people who beat you and try your bot specifically against them
 Bozo: Hi, in Bronze mode, what is the Cost for growing a tree from size 3 to 4&#160;?
 Numby: can't grow past 3
 Numby: once it's at 3 you can only complete it
 pmor: 3 is the largest size, you can only complete the lifecycle for 4 sun points
 Bozo: ha sorry
 Bozo: thanks
 Bozo: my mistake
 Wontonimo: such a Bozo mistake
 Wontonimo: (sorry, couldn't help it)
 Bozo: i know&#160;:-D
 elderlybeginner: anyone without sim in platinum?
 Wontonimo: you mean legend?
 elderlybeginner: yes, legend
 Wontonimo: i think there are a few, a very few.
 elderlybeginner: after gold should be platinum, thou :wink:
 Petrify36: Gold -&gt; Platinum -&gt; Diamond -&gt; Master -&gt; Apex Predator
 Petrify36: oh wait wrong game
 Wontonimo: C -&gt; B -&gt; A -&gt; S
 Wontonimo: -&gt; Saitama
 NinjaDoggy: where's SS?
 reCurse: SSS
 CouscousAgha: so close to legend yet so far...
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, I mean I beat a silver player that evauntlly promoted to gold that once saw a higher gold rated player that was close to beating one of the top golden players that is similar in ranking to legend rank, so I'm in the same boat aswell
 CouscousAgha: i make my player say 69ms on every action just to give the illusion im using sims 
 CouscousAgha: hopefully it will secretly buff my player
 CameronWatt: holy moly rolly polly
 EnderWiggins: I am not able to Approve/Reject anybody's clash of code puzzle made even though I did 50 clashes. Can anybody help?
 CouscousAgha: im top 16 now idk if i should re submit and attempt legend again or wait for people to push me up
 Wontonimo: Better to look at you Score.  How many points are you away?
 CouscousAgha: 48.40 vs 50.78 for the boss
 Wontonimo: you are about 2.5 points away, so probably not gonna get there with a push
 Wontonimo: imho
 CouscousAgha: yeah i thought so
 Wontonimo: Can you squeeze any more performance out of your bot?
 Wontonimo: play with some hyper parameters at least?
 CouscousAgha: at this point I have no idea
 Wontonimo: same boat
 CouscousAgha: every bit of squeeze feels like a 70% win chance vs everyone near me
 Wontonimo: what's your bot?  what kind of search you using?
 CouscousAgha: purely heuristic
 Wontonimo: sweeeet&#160;!!  Good job!
 CouscousAgha: I started since day 1 of the challenge 
 CouscousAgha: kept adding and deleting stuff
 CouscousAgha: and i felt like it was becoming messy 
 Wontonimo: my heuristic is a tower of cards
 CouscousAgha: so I redid my code today with all the ideas and strategies on my mind
 Wontonimo: and are you using brutal tester?
 Wontonimo: vs your old bots?
 CouscousAgha: took me about 4 hours but i went from top 190 to legend 
 CouscousAgha: i mean almost legend
 Wontonimo: i was gonna say, you must have pissed someone off to get kicked out
 CouscousAgha: yeah lol
 CouscousAgha: man these guys who keep attempting to get out of gold are buffing the boss 
 CouscousAgha: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 CameronWatt: python bros recking my linq c# skills in code golf in clash
 CameronWatt: ripperino
 Wontonimo: haha ... doesn't quite work that way.  it's more like they are making a wall of a variety of strats for you to also have to beat
 NinjaDoggy: nah buffing the boss is real
 Zenoscave: Wontonimo if you lose against the boss a bunch it does buff it
 Numby: how is the boss buffed O.o
 Wontonimo: its score increases, but it doesn't get smarter
 NinjaDoggy: score is the only thing that matters though&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: No but that score is enough
 Zenoscave: quit beating me NinjaDoggy
 CouscousAgha: well when u increases its score means u need more wins to get surpass it
 Zenoscave: This isn't that much of a buff compared to some competitions though
 Zenoscave: But it is iratating
 Wontonimo: hey Zenoscave, i see you've been coming very close!
 CouscousAgha: Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: Not close enough
 Wontonimo: i hear that
 Zenoscave: yes CouscousAgha
 CouscousAgha: come give some push to your pal here
 Noyotens: guys i am at gold now YAAAAAAAAAY :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 CouscousAgha: congrats! welcome to elo hell
 CouscousAgha: if you've ever heard of it 
 Cjx_1: big grats &lt;3
 NinjaDoggy: sorry zeno&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: lol
 Noyotens: THANK YOU GUYS
 NinjaDoggy: congratz on gold! :D
 Wontonimo: congrats Noyotens&#160;!
 Noyotens: thanks
 Zenoscave: CouscousAgha I beat you in the current bot... like 80% of the time
 CouscousAgha: are you sure
 CouscousAgha: it was 3 to 2
 Zenoscave: Not enough plays yet on this new submit but there's a big improvement
 Zenoscave: 5/1 me in IDE
 Zenoscave: Not enough to be confident but I think it's good
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555704411">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555704411</a>
 Noyotens: u have error
 Zenoscave: Noyotens was that in IDE?
 Noyotens: no
 Zenoscave: MAny bots time out in IDE currently
 CouscousAgha: Zenoscave go easy on my 69ms heuristic bot
 Zenoscave: "69ms"
 Zenoscave: Nice buff
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: bluff*
 Smelty: nice.
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Smelty:&#160;;)
 CouscousAgha: yeah im almost positive making your bot say 69ms will buff it
 Zenoscave: c-c-c-c-omb breaker
 CouscousAgha: i think getting top10 in gold as a first timer without any sim is a good achievement 
 Zenoscave: definitely
 jrke: can anyone gimme a better idea for heuristic?
 Zenoscave: Don't
 Zenoscave: there's the best idea
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 CouscousAgha: ^
 BrunoFelthes: jrke first move wait
 NinjaDoggy: wait grow wait grow seed&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: ^^
 CouscousAgha: the amount of burnt brain cells to get a good heuristic is definitely not recommended 
 BrunoFelthes: wait grow wait seed grow
 NinjaDoggy: debatable on the order :P
 NinjaDoggy: i think grow first is better
 BrunoFelthes: you can lose your spot if you grow first
 CouscousAgha: wait grow2 wait grow2 seed wait grow2 grow1 seed
 CouscousAgha: chad order
 NinjaDoggy: you can counter seed if you see them do it first
 Zenoscave: seed in better position. Plus same spot seeds are rare in first few day
 BrunoFelthes: ok, grow first if you can lose the spot that you want
 BrunoFelthes: cant*
 Zenoscave: When is it more advantagous to not complete a tree and gather sun instead?
 NinjaDoggy: zeno
 Zenoscave: hm?
 NinjaDoggy: you might as well ask what's the point of life
 NinjaDoggy: with a question that hard :P
 Zenoscave: no I mean in end game. When should you stop completing
 CouscousAgha: Zenoscave if i figure that out I will be legend by now
 NinjaDoggy: when it gives you more points than completing&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: A lot of my losses are I have more score but WAY less sun
 NinjaDoggy: like it actually depends on a lot
 NinjaDoggy: mainly on opponent
 NinjaDoggy: and nutrients
 Zenoscave: Gotcha
 abenner: 'Compilation took too long and has been interrupted' woo hoo I love rust
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555706781">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555706781</a>
 Noyotens: guys anyone have any replay to how beat gold
 Zenoscave: Like this crap
 NinjaDoggy: tbh I haven't been doing too much heuristics stuff
 NinjaDoggy: I made like 18 variables
 NinjaDoggy: and have been running my 5900x non stop past 2 days to optimize them&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: christ
 CouscousAgha: my god
 CouscousAgha: thats p2w
 Zenoscave: Paramfiddler?
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 NinjaDoggy: p2w indeed&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: I see people asking how many threads max for brutal testers
 NinjaDoggy: and i'm like lol... here I am running 20 threads XD
 CouscousAgha: how much it took you to write it
 Wontonimo: $5
 CouscousAgha: LOL
 Wontonimo: or 3 meters&#160;?
 Zaphus: 12 parsecs?
 CouscousAgha: bro the bot just got +0.3 buff
 Wontonimo: i've been taking notes of the boss over the day.  8 hours ago it was 52.29. 3 hours it was 51.81
 Noyotens: this bot have 142IQ
 Wontonimo: now it's 51.17
 Wontonimo: so, i wouldn't say it's been going up today
 CouscousAgha: i guess i will go sleep it's almost 4 am here
 CouscousAgha: i get like 0.1 push every win and my winrate is kinda above 50
 CouscousAgha: soon enough i might get to the boss myself
 ClockSort: yess, a small change in my MCTS rollout made a big difference. #23 Gold and climbing!! fingers crossed for my first ever reaching Legend in a CG contest :metal:

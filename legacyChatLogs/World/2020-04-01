 Warzed: i need helphow to convert all characters to lowercase in string c++
 stone43: I'm not a C guy but can't you treat the character as a number and add 32(decimal) which is the difference between ascii "A" and ascii "a"
 Warzed: okay
 Warzed: mm there is a problem, string contains either uppercase and lowercase, the demand is convert all of characters into lowercase
 Zenoscave: if (c &lt; 'a') c+= ('a'-'A');
 stone43: you need to iterate over every character and check to see if it's uppercase
 stone43: what Z said&#160;:)
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: or you could use the Standard lib functions
 Warzed: im new here, and im solving MIME type 
 Warzed: here is my code

 Warzed: but i used string to read sentence
 Warzed: string s[1001];
 Warzed: for(int i=1;i&lt;=10;i++)
 Warzed: cin&gt;&gt;s[i];
 Zenoscave: probably meant to not do an array of strings
 Warzed: is there any method to read sentence
 Warzed: any other
 Zenoscave: what do you mean by sentence?
 Zenoscave: a line?
 Warzed: yes
 Zenoscave: cin will read a whole line
 Warzed: bunch of words
 Warzed: suppose s[1] contains one word
 Warzed: s[i] would be a sentence
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aabc6e67-f272-4b55-8461-afaa9cef308c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aabc6e67-f272-4b55-8461-afaa9cef308c</a>
 Zenoscave: that's not how arrays work
 Zenoscave: string s[1001]; means an array of 1001 strings  accessing s[i] means the entire string at index i. You don't need an array like that 
 Warzed: i used string s[100],d[100];  for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++) cin&gt;&gt;s[i]&gt;&gt;d[i];
 Warzed: and it is reading sentence
 Warzed: one word for each s[i]

 Quidome: What kind of NN tools did you use?
 AntiSquid: now you can flap along with the birds
 Zpooks: Since it's autoplaying, I'd argue that he doesn't have to flap at all.
 Zpooks: *badumtish*

 wlesavo: #1 :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: you're welcome wlesavo

 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl just was gonna thank you
 eulerscheZahl: hm, cgstats doesn't sort correctly on same score
 wlesavo: well this one counts, last one was due to kovi and siman rersubmiting at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: take a screenshot
 eulerscheZahl: ping Magus are you there?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/rqub9t">https://prnt.sc/rqub9t</a>
 wlesavo: already did :wink:
 struct: is it really python?
 wlesavo: sure
 eulerscheZahl: why do you doubt it?
 struct: I dont doubt
 wlesavo: im not very good at any other lang
 struct: just wanted to be sure
 wlesavo: neither python actually
 eulerscheZahl: do you remember the bash guy on coders of the carribbean legend? :D
 struct: was it actualyl bash?=
 struct: wtf
 eulerscheZahl: he found a python bot on github and added a bash wrapper to hide that
 struct: ah right
 eulerscheZahl: but kept telling everyone that it was plain bash
 Zpooks: Weak
 eulerscheZahl: was a huge contest with 3600 participantsthose were times...
 Magus:&#160;?
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl cant the cg stuff see the actuall code?
 wlesavo: Magus accendeing seems to be wrong
 eulerscheZahl: Magus you show the #2 player above #1 if they have the same score
 Magus: oh
 eulerscheZahl: and i was too lazy to open an issue on github (or even fix it myself)
 Magus: i don't remember sorting players myself, weird
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo staff can see the codesand they took action
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl oh i see, so thats how it become known
 eulerscheZahl: lots of python bots at the topand if you play them against each other, it was a perfect mirror
 wlesavo: lol
 struct: Did something happened to the guy who shared the bot on github?
 eulerscheZahl: disqualified for that contestbut he didn't do it with bad intention, just syncing between devices and not thinking about making it public that way
 eulerscheZahl: he's still competing on CG
 pb4: Was it coders of the carribean&#160;? I remember this for hypersonic
 eulerscheZahl: cotc and gitc contests
 struct: I wasnt here on hypersonic
 struct: and I remember it
 struct: so it was cotc
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic has a huge clone army in the multiplayer section
 eulerscheZahl: and i can easily find some bots for the current contest as wellthe only question: are these better than what try-harders can do? hopefully the answer is no
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't think we'll find a top bot
 AntiSquid: bug
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll .
 AntiSquid: was replying to wlesavo's #1 comment
 eulerscheZahl: he's doing much better than I expected him to doespecially for your first contest, good job!
 kovi: grat wlesavo
 wlesavo: thx kovi
 wlesavo: improved my mine escaping a little, seems to be working with surfacings
 eulerscheZahl: harder to hit you
 kovi: nice. still on my list
 pb4: "seems to be working with surfacings"
 pb4: What does that mean&#160;?
 wlesavo: i surface when its too dangerous to keep moving
 wlesavo: but its hard to balance
 pb4: oh nice
 pb4: I didn't put that on my todo list
 pb4: I was kinda sure it would be bad
 wlesavo: i was not sure it would work as well
 pb4: 100% sure to lose 1 life now vs maybe lose lives in the future... 
 pb4: My AI is going backwords instead of forward in terms of strength&#160;:(
 pb4: backwards*
 wlesavo: but with improved damage estimation it worked
 Zpooks: Are you guys bots/AI as advanced as it looks like from an outside perspective? :P
 Zpooks: Or sounds like, rather.
 wlesavo: as for mine not advanced at all, bunch of heuristics and stuff like that compiled together, i guess mine damage estimation is the only worthy thing 
 pb4: You probably have a good opponent tracker also
 pb4: I'd expect everyone at the top to have the same tracker
 struct: Do you track paths wlesav?
 wlesavo: not ideal, i do not track every possible path
 wlesavo: but i do some path tracking
 reCurse: Are you respecting GDPR?
 reCurse: If the opponent asks for the data you hold about him, you need to provide it
 Asterixk: it's encrypted now
 darkhorse64: The data is only stored for a short period of time and is not nominative
 reCurse: This only applies if the map can be shown to fit some part of EU
 reCurse: It's not stored for a short period of time if it's logged to stderr :P
 kovi: it is only stored for statistical purposes
 kovi: meta is getting heavy
 reCurse: What is it now
 kovi: dont know, but i see rockpaperscissors effect in score
 kovi: wlesavo &gt; me &gt; siman/pb &gt; wlesavo
 reCurse: Yeah I sort of called it at the start of the contest
 reCurse: Not the individuals but it seems like there's a thousand of holes to plug in any given strat
 wlesavo: well i still target silence N 0 so it makes some sence
 kovi: yeah, that one for example
 reCurse: Leaderboards will only get more confusing as it nears the end
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: I had not identified who did it, but I'll name the line in my code after you&#160;:)
 reCurse: Not sure I follow
 reCurse: Target silence N 0?
 pb4:           score += xorRandInt(5); //anti-wlesavo
 wlesavo: lol, thats an honor :slight_smile:
 reCurse: Assume nothing happened?
 inoryy: wow 4.2k participants?
 pb4: I silence randomly, just to avoid people who might target silence 0
 AntiSquid: if 3k are stuck in IDE then yes inoryy
 wlesavo: reCurse kovi uses silence 0, just not to harm himself jumping somewhere bad
 reCurse: Yeah only 1.3k submissions or so
 inoryy: ah nvm I was looking at registered users
 reCurse: Ok so you see silence and assume it's 0?
 reCurse: Yeah that's exactly what I don't like about that kind of game
 wlesavo: i check if silence 0 candidates survive over time and than weight them havily over the others
 pb4: "wlesavo 16H50reCurse kovi uses silence 0, just not to harm himself jumping somewhere bad"
 pb4: uh&#160;?
 reCurse: Makes your performance extremely dependent on your opponents
 reCurse: e.g. if most bots do silence 0 then you're doing great
 wlesavo: pb4 if you wont estimate silence correctly, i could end up in the mine field
 reCurse: If meta shifts and everyone doesn't do it, you suck
 reCurse: etc
 wlesavo: you*
 pb4: I always thought about silence 0 as a way not to waste precious empty space
 reCurse: That's true of any action
 pb4: nope
 pb4: Only silence and move "consume" space
 wlesavo: reCurse no, this way it doesnot struggle against others, but at some extent punish silence 0
 pb4: Move trades "space" for "charges"
 reCurse: How is that wrong? Using sonar makes you not waste precious space
 pb4: silence doesn't trade space for anything useful - other that uncertainty for the opponent. And you don't get more uncertainty for a silence 4 compared to a silence 0
 wlesavo: pb4 well also that, but i think it is smaller than potential damage from mines
 pb4: I have no idea how to efficiently avoid mines&#160;:/
 pb4: They can just be...... anywhere
 reCurse: Just kill him first
 kovi: pb4, nice analysis
 Palmipedus: if you track all the path, then you'll be able to know where they are once you find opp
 reCurse: That's wrong
 kovi: and nice submit (pb4)
 Palmipedus: but avoiding mines will use more space
 Palmipedus: so better to kill him first
 Palmipedus: reCurse what's wrong?
 wlesavo: Palmipedus a lot of aspects to it, most you can have some possible positions, more than 4 generally
 Palmipedus: ha yeah we don;t have the direction where he put it
 Palmipedus: I'm glad i haven't even try to track mines
 Palmipedus: reCurse so when are going to participate in another contest?
 reCurse: SILENCE N 0
 wlesavo: nice use of silence
 struct: do you also SILENCE in other directions 0&#160;?
 reCurse: Maybe I do
 reCurse: Maybe I don't
 Tunga: Politic answer&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: reCurse will you compete in this competition whatsoever? I bet you have great ideas that could change meta
 reCurse: SILENCE E 4
 icecream17: I thought about tracking mines, because if the opponent blows up a mine you can track the position indirectly
 ZarthaxX: you should
 Zenoscave: that's a big part of the game icecream17
 Tunga: Silver league issues? 
 Zenoscave: One I just figured out I forgot to implement fully
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Zenoscave: just kinda pewpewed myself with that
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Kadrex: Guys, is this scoreboard buggy?
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 04:53PMsilence doesn't trade space for anything useful - other that uncertainty for the opponent.
 eulerscheZahl: you can also rush an attack with a larger jump
 wlesavo: i call that fatality
 Zenoscave: killer move is my name for it
 eulerscheZahl: i call it "kill" in my message, when i do it
 wlesavo: first so it in mchl12 replays, figured out that was what he called GG

 eulerscheZahl: no problem, you can outsource that to me
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl thx, you helped with that nicely
 pb4: is that feature important for you&#160;? I had it in a previous code and didn't bother to re-implement it
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 wlesavo: many games are finished this way, so probab;y yes
 eulerscheZahl: but might be because of my poor ovarall-fighting logic
 pb4: Will re-implement it then...
 pb4: But I'm near the char limit already&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: wow
 eulerscheZahl: 872 lines here
 wlesavo: wow
 Zenoscave: 976
 eulerscheZahl: 32.085 bytes
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: do you know if the self-compiled code is allowed here&#160;?
 wlesavo: 1500, but have some duplicate old parts 
 struct: I dont think so pb4
 eulerscheZahl: no obfuscation, that's all i know
 pb4: Is renaming all variables to single letters considered obfuscation&#160;? :D
 eulerscheZahl: and you already got disqualified in a semi-private hackathon iirc
 pb4: yep I did...
 eulerscheZahl: CG has some cheat detection which they run on your code
 eulerscheZahl: they can't, if you submit a binary encoded as a string
 eulerscheZahl: but single letter var names are fine i think
 AntiSquid: 608 lines or probably less, didn't refactor / remove comments
 eulerscheZahl: my teacher in school always coded like this
 eulerscheZahl: var names: a,b,c,d,...

 Palmipedus: hey guys, question about performance, what is your dataStructure for storing the paths? 
 eulerscheZahl: Path = List&lt;Cell&gt;Tracker = List&lt;Path&gt;and it's too slow, so i'll change it :D
 Palmipedus: mine is probably not good as around 8k if the opponent silence than I'll timeout
 Palmipedus: yeah that's what I have
 eulerscheZahl: most top players didn't silence that much until kovi decided to attack my algo rather than my submarine
 Palmipedus: atm I'm just doing a reset when too much path
 Palmipedus: yeah I only had the problem with the low rank in silver
 eulerscheZahl: HashSet or boolean array should be fasteror bitboards
 eulerscheZahl: i do a reset too, keeping the current locations at least
 Palmipedus: at the end of contest, if you don;t mind sahring your datastructure eulerscheZahl
 Palmipedus: as I'm also using c#
 Palmipedus: yes ssame thing for reset
 Quidome: How many players get promoted to gold end of the week?
 Zenoscave: I would be interested too
 eulerscheZahl: i can but i really don't think there's anything interesting in my bot
 Zenoscave: there must be something. you're 5th
 eulerscheZahl: i guess 150 to gold, but don't know either
 eulerscheZahl: going up and down, was 7th a few minutes ago
 Quidome: That's a lot...
 Zenoscave: have a bump
 Zenoscave:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i also expect more than 15 players in legend when it opensthe last time legend was bigger on a marathon
 Zenoscave: Do you expect many more meta shifts?
 Palmipedus: I've been around #80-90 all day so i'll probably make the cut
 Zenoscave: I think there's at least one left
 Palmipedus: but that will be the last league for me
 eulerscheZahl: no idea about the metai rarely follow that discussion
 Zenoscave: wlesavo, you're doing strong with python gz
 wlesavo: wait till this submit will finish
 wlesavo: it is going very good
 Zenoscave: Big improvement?
 wlesavo: well yeah, i finally fixed my silence can actually compete for #1 now
 Zenoscave: fixed silence? 
 Zenoscave: Is  SILENCE x 0 not good?
 wlesavo: well it was bad, and now its not that bad
 Zenoscave: meta shift!
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Zenoscave back in top10 as well
 Zenoscave: for now might drop a bit at end
 Zenoscave: 11th&#160;:(
 kovi: robo is coming too
 Zenoscave: robo are you hiding or just starting late?
 kovi: late
 Zenoscave: ah
 wlesavo: i saw royale in silver too
 kovi: ok, time to learn something
 kovi: even with lucky rolls vs. wlesavo he might be ahead
 wlesavo: lost every single game against kovi, yeah
 kovi: except 1
 wlesavo: oh, just won one
 Zenoscave: Praise RNGeses
 Zenoscave: Praise RNGesus
 eulerscheZahl: robo isn't a hider
 eulerscheZahl: was leading code royale from start to finish
 kovi: karliso is the top hider lately
 eulerscheZahl: he played onitama 3 or 4 days ago
 MadKnight: don't hide your bot Automaton2000&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: check the submit data
 eulerscheZahl: date
 Automaton2000: still no idea why it works
 Zenoscave: MadKnight
 kovi: he asked about ooc yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: ah, so he's coming
 kovi: guess so
 MadKnight: Zenobia
 MadKnight: Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: he won't play and be happy about just reaching legend i think
 Zenoscave: hows your bot MK
 kovi: still 3 point randomness
 MadKnight: still very basic
 MadKnight: goes random
 MadKnight: but avoids problems
 MadKnight: and how's yours Zenoscave&#160;?
 wlesavo: 31 games winstreak :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: calm down
 wlesavo: wtf is that submit
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: you are so far above, i don't even get a chance to play against you&#160;:(
 struct: Will matches be mirrored in legend? or you dont know?
 reCurse: I'd guess not
 eulerscheZahl: don't know but i consider it unlikely
 struct: I have 1 question, so for each 2 matches you do, is 1 as player 1 and other as player 2?
 eulerscheZahl: give us some stats of p1 vs p2 winrates so we have something to argue with
 wlesavo: mirror means paired games with the same seed?
 reCurse: I think the side you're on is random every game
 reCurse: So you could in theory have a submit where you only play as P1
 struct: Time to collect stats of p1 and p2 winrates then
 reCurse: Why would you think there's a significant imbalance
 struct: I dont think there is
 struct: But I also think that mirror matches cant hurt
 reCurse: Of course it can
 reCurse: Twice the server costs and submit times for no good reason
 reCurse: And even then, though I'm going to go further than intended
 reCurse: For those asymmetric games, it's likely you'll gain accuracy by having twice as many games with no mirror than having mirror games.
 reCurse: But that's a hunch, could be way off the mark.
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl Not the first days for CR :p
 Nagatwin: Anyway, gj wlesavo for #1 in python
 AntiSquid: what if it's a bash bot wrapped in python to fool us
 Nagatwin: That would be mad
 wlesavo: Nagatwin thx :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: let me guess: you were first for a while Nagatwin?
 Nagatwin: Yeah like half of it
 Nagatwin: and then the simus came&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: that's what always happens
 eulerscheZahl: when you can simulate a game, someone will
 reCurse: How do you know it's simu
 reCurse: Is there a SIMU command sent by opponent?
 Nagatwin: They are flagged by CG didn't you knwo&#160;?
 reCurse: uh
 Nagatwin: Joking
 eulerscheZahl: they usually tell in the post mortemi tend to trust these
 Nagatwin: Yeah same, by the end of CR it was pretty clear anyway
 reCurse: Oh CR
 reCurse: -1 reading comprehension
 reCurse: I thought crystal rush was more about heuristics still
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not used to that new multiplayer name yet
 eulerscheZahl: damn CG, creating 2 games with the same acronym

 linjoehan: what's the board game that C4L is based on?
 eulerscheZahl: splendor
 linjoehan: yes thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i think i read the same question some hours ago
 linjoehan: yeah but I was off and the scroll don't go that far back
 eulerscheZahl: and AntiSquid answering with a link to the game
 eulerscheZahl: do you consider a purchase?
 Tunga: How can I gather opponents commands? 
 eulerscheZahl: Line 3: opponentOrders, a summary of the actions (separated by |) that your opponent has made during its turn.
 [CG]Thibaud: you need to parse it
 Tunga: Oh, thanks
 Tunga: Even the basic movements are problematic in bots
 Tunga: Now I am going to fire up some torpidos!
 Tunga: First time botter here 
 icecream17: =)
 Tunga: When I submit the code, it ll let me play against some players? 
 Tunga: Then if I submit later, again will play another players too&#160;?
 Zenoscave: yes tunga
 Tunga: Every submit change the position&#160;?
 Tunga: Because of the score?
 Zenoscave: It is random who you play but based mostly on rank
 icecream17: You can change the boss player by pressing "delete" under the "players" -&gt; Cpt. Levine square
 eulerscheZahl: poor captain levine
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, it's not the original levine anymorego delete it
 Tunga: How many match will my bot do&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your league
 eulerscheZahl: 90 in silver
 dbdr: kovi: I was thinking, if France or Germany wanted to do as well as Hungary relative to their population, they would need 15+ people in the top 10
 eulerscheZahl: where are China and India?
 Zenoscave: lol nice dbdr how would US need to do?
 dbdr: 40 people in top 10
 reCurse: Those math
 wlesavo: lol
 dbdr: more actually, but let's be generous
 Tunga: Are we going to fight against everyone in the league or randm 100 players? 
 eulerscheZahl: 10 random at the beginning
 eulerscheZahl: then your rank -10, +5 i think
 Tunga: Jezz this is very exciting, I already won a lot of matches :D 
 reCurse: Not 10 random
 Tunga: It is going to make like 80-90 matches right now
 dbdr: good random
 eulerscheZahl: 10 for each 10th of the leaderboard approximately
 reCurse: 10 uniformly distributed amongst each 10%
 Tunga: I just made a simple pathing algorithm without even firing a torpido and won %60 of the match in lowest rank lmao 
 Tunga: Lowest league *
 eulerscheZahl: when legend is still small (maybe 25 players), you will sometimes get 2 matches against the same player in the first 10
 eulerscheZahl: that's why it's the lowest league
 eulerscheZahl: you won't win anything in silver that way
 Tunga: Yey, 1 league up 
 Tunga: Wood 1 in just 1 submit
 Tunga: First time bot gamer, this is really fun tho
 Zenoscave: Don't let your ego get too big&#160;;)
 Tunga: They ll definitely kill me here, I have no doubts Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444421887">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444421887</a>the bronze boss beats you with ease
 Tunga: That is an unfortune map 
 Tunga: :D 
 eulerscheZahl: there are no bad maps, just bad map handling
 reCurse: Very hard to blame the map here
 Tunga: Like I said, very basic pathing 
 Tunga: If I manage to add torpido, I ll be in silver 
 Csipcsirip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/444204817">https://www.codingame.com/replay/444204817</a>
 Tunga: Lmao 
 Tunga: That map tho
 reCurse: Nice
 Zenoscave: Solid top 10 finally!!!
 AntiSquid: game of the year
 Zenoscave: for sure
 reCurse: Speaking of dumb maps
 reCurse: You can try seed 9051324
 AntiSquid: aren't seeds longer than that?
 wlesavo: reCurse лол
 reCurse: They don't have to be
 wlesavo: nice one
 struct: seed can = 1
 struct: or even 0
 Csipcsirip: is the left side bigger than right&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: ezpz <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444427290">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444427290</a> wlesavo
 reCurse: ez
 AntiSquid: i guess they generate terrain based on the seed number?
 Quidome: Having a submit message going with the submit would be really nice to have&#160;:)
 icecream17: "seed=thisisaseed???"
 reCurse: What else would they do
 wlesavo: AntiSquid damn again lost self track, need to find that bug
 AntiSquid: sure, me winning is always a bug
 reCurse: You're like a known constant
 reCurse: Secure value like gold
 Zenoscave: Do you think league for legend will be 20+? is it too early to tell?
 AntiSquid: yes
 blasterpoard: 50+
 blasterpoard: because it will be created early
 blasterpoard: and people will have a lot of time to get there
 Zenoscave: created early?
 Zenoscave: ah true
 blasterpoard: a week before the end
 AntiSquid: 3 weeks dev 
 Zenoscave: I meant at opening
 AntiSquid: it goes straight into multi anyway
 Zenoscave: sweet
 Uljahn: 15 at opening i guess
 Zenoscave: Maybe I'll make legend during a contest for once
 AntiSquid: i am inclined to believe it might be 10 at opening
 AntiSquid: the 1 week time to improve + it will be a multi anyway 
 Zenoscave: I'm running out of ideas for improvements though
 struct: 10 sems to low
 blasterpoard: the less people in legend, the better
 AntiSquid: no break after contest, less people lose interest
 AntiSquid: so imo  10
 reCurse: They've done worse
 AntiSquid: there was a 5-er oepning right?
 eulerscheZahl: i bet for a large legend league on opening
 reCurse: What no why
 eulerscheZahl: was like that for locam too (the other marathon)
 reCurse: Need to pull some strings so it opens for top 2
 AntiSquid: hm why so worried reCurse, are you competing?
 reCurse: No I just enjoy the struggle for legend
 Zenoscave: TOP 2 sounds awful
 reCurse: Everyone agonizing over gold boss
 Zenoscave: I love it
 AntiSquid: crash submit before legend opens
 AntiSquid: boycott the top 2 open
 Zenoscave: It would be interesting to see how kovi and wlseavo do alone
 Zenoscave: name drops sorry
 reCurse: 67143174 is pretty awful too
 AntiSquid: recurse going through seeds :thinking:
 reCurse: Just having fun
 AntiSquid: of course
 kovi: i have 30% vs. wlsevo now
 Tunga: Kovi going up&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: your bot isnt working so well on that map too wlesavo
 kovi: wlesavo (sorry)
 reCurse: The mapgen code is, well
 reCurse: Pretty bad
 reCurse: So I was wondering how bad it can get
 wlesavo: kovi also just discovered some bug forcing me to send double commands in this submit 
 wlesavo: in some of last replays
 wlesavo: Csipcsirip it can spawn in center randomly, yeah, didnt bother to fix that yet
 Tunga: "4,226 CodinGamers have registered to this contest" but only 1318 people on the list. 1318 is the only submitters? 
 reCurse: It's marketing techniques
 reCurse: Like when they say there's over a million people on CG
 Tunga: It is wise tho 
 Uljahn: 3 Billion devices run Java, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i only know that it was a problem
 Zenoscave: it is a problem
 Zenoscave: very few of those are settop boxes Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: so you think it's a good thing to do
 Zenoscave: Not at all
 Zenoscave: Don't you listen Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you live in the us
 Zenoscave: where does euler live Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you can reach top 10
 struct: That Java messages still shows?
 struct: Or they removed it
 struct: It seems to be 7 years old
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 hates the US&#160;? 
 Automaton2000: i think i will have to study
 AntiSquid: in ah-merry-ka&#160;? Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: no but i mean the ones that i have no clue why
 dbdr: what's a bad map?
 AntiSquid: ^ lots of land and lakes i guess&#160;?
 dbdr: lot of land cn be interesting too
 dbdr: lakes only fun to catch careless people
 reCurse: I'm sure some sick minds can enjoy playing 156183823
 reCurse: Probably minority though
 AntiSquid: perfect :D
 dbdr: yeah, more than one connected component of water does not really make sense
 dbdr: it could with &gt;2 players :D
 blasterpoard: reCurse my hidden bot which is very good at hiding can only hide for 16 turns on that map xD
 blasterpoard: WWWNEENENWNWNWSW
 blasterpoard: until you can reliably hit it with torpedo
 AntiSquid: well maybe it would b idea to start in the bigger lake&#160;?
 reCurse: Maybe that's the metric I should use then
 reCurse: Number of turns to stay hidden
 blasterpoard: normally it's about 50-60
 reCurse: There has to be worse I only examined a tiny fraction of possibilities
 blasterpoard: 16 is the least I've seen so far
 AntiSquid: you have a script to find bad seeds?
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: Relying on land count and disconnected
 reCurse: But number of turns to stay hidden sounds more promising
 reCurse: Also more complex
 Tunga: reCurse, do you have any opening jobs at your place &lt;3&#160;? 
 reCurse: Always
 dbdr: how is hidden defined? more than 1 possible position?
 reCurse: Yeah
 blasterpoard: dbdr I define it "there can't be a torpedo that can't hit all possibel position"
 reCurse: Hm
 eulerscheZahl: double negation?
 blasterpoard: on a normal seed, like f.e. -8066070417831458800, I can stay "hidden" for 48 turns
 AntiSquid: wlesavo fix it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444440539">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444440539</a>
 Tunga: reCurse, chat with me on discord if you have time dude?
 blasterpoard: *that can hit
 reCurse: I meant that tongue in cheek
 reCurse: Sure there's always openings
 reCurse: Are they openings you're qualified/interested into, I don't know
 reCurse: I'm not a recruiter
 Tunga: I want to chat with you if you have time 
 reCurse: Sure
 wlesavo: AntiSquid well, its on my list
 AntiSquid: it's a meme, you're supposed to find the tiniest bug in someone's bot and annoy them with it to fix it wlesavo
 reCurse: It's called doing a MK
 wlesavo: AntiSquid oh, i see, not that tiny though 
 eulerscheZahl: then fix it asap
 dbdr: by yesterday
 AntiSquid: when is it fixed?
 icecream17: lol
 wlesavo: already :wink:
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 samda: 3
 eulerscheZahl: kovi what's your submit count?
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl referee shows that your previous command when you timeout due to some reason, is it an intended behaviour? spended some time looking for that double print :slight_smile:
 dbdr: it wrapped around
 wlesavo: shows your previous command
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo don't teach automaton a way to start a sentence
 kovi: 20 per day approx.
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm not sure what you meantooltip? text below viewer? area under the board?
 dbdr: so around 240? :D
 wlesavo: the colored text ander the field
 wlesavo: under
 eulerscheZahl: do i have to find a crashed game now?
 eulerscheZahl: or create one?
 kovi: i started 4-5 days later
 dbdr: ah right
 eulerscheZahl: then only 140
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: did you not know about it earlier?
 wlesavo: sorry, here its even draws second sonar action i mean circle stuff
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i know to whom to report that :D
 wlesavo: its probably due to that additional frame dbdr wanted  :slight_smile:
 lNitsua: for ocean of code, if the opponent uses a torpedo order out of range, do I still see the orders?
 kovi: no
 lNitsua: cause that could be used for ruining other peoples detection, and could potentially ruin mine
 lNitsua: ok awesome, thanks
 dbdr: if CG fixed the Game Information bug it would help
 lNitsua: bug?
 dbdr: this bug: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/issues-with-the-game-information-in-the-replay-viewer/168156">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/issues-with-the-game-information-in-the-replay-viewer/168156</a>
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud gave you a &lt;3 implying that he saw it (and probably added to the bug tracker)
 dbdr: I'm sure about the first part of that sentence
 dbdr: if there is a bug tracker, I would be curious about its health&#160;;)
 reCurse: They had to upgrade it to 64 bit because of the backlog
 dbdr: that should fix it for the foreseeable future
 dbdr: if not, there's u128&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the bug tracker is in JS, only 53bit for integers
 reCurse: If it runs on the chat server that explains a lot
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: it is *implemented* as a chat server
 dbdr:  /open bug UI
 reCurse: I like that theory
 eulerscheZahl: from their semi-public projects it might just be a trello board :thinking:
 AmineYahia: hi guys 
 AmineYahia: who can help me with Nintendo Sponsored Challenge

 reCurse: Took me 10 seconds
 dbdr: I had a silly bug with my sectors, they went:
 dbdr: 1...2...3
 dbdr: with 4 same as 1, 5 same as 2 etc :D
 reCurse: ...
 reCurse: How do you rank top 10 with that
 struct: yeah
 struct: lol
 icecream17: sector = (x - (x mod 5)) + (3 * (y - (y mod 5))) + 1
 struct: Was about to say normal mitake for top 10
 dbdr: it does not come up that often
 dbdr: only for surfaces and radars
 Tunga: Can I see my old league replays&#160;? 
 struct: But its still a big thing no? at least for tracking
 dbdr: definitely better that it is fixed (and tested), but effects falls in the noise
 Tunga: When I get upper league, Cant see old league replays
 dbdr: for tracking surfaces
 reCurse: Just a ripple in the ocean
 dbdr: which is very rare
 dbdr: and 1, 5 and 9 were correct&#160;:)
 dbdr: silly copy paste bug, left a x instead of a y
 eulerscheZahl: there is no radar dbdr, only sonar :P
 eulerscheZahl: hence the name of the board game
 dbdr: I call it radar
 dbdr: s is silence already
 struct: how many small lakes you want?
 struct: -1266569109
 dbdr: that letter is taken
 eulerscheZahl: but radar is crystal rush
 eulerscheZahl: or codebusters
 dbdr: you see, there is a radar in every game basically
 eulerscheZahl: i want more, Tobou
 dbdr: reCurse can bruteforce the seed to optimize any metric
 reCurse: ANY METRIC
 eulerscheZahl: that's what tobou did too
 AmineYahia: okay thanks recurse
 struct: how many lakes you want?
 struct: 6?
 reCurse: Such an irresponsible chosen one for such power
 icecream17: Is it possible to have a map where primes are islands?
 eulerscheZahl: as many lakes as possible
 dbdr: I want N lakes on a map recognized as the digit N by a NN trained on MNIST
 reCurse: My answer starts with N
 icecream17: the seed can also be letters and words
 dbdr: no problem?
 reCurse: Warmer
 dbdr: \o/
 icecream17: Try seed=thisisaseed??? or seed=Infinity
 dbdr: oh, read winner :D
 inoryy: Not an issue

 MadKnight: Madmannbytes
 MadKnight: Astromadmann
 Astrobytes: Oi Madeleine, how is your OoC bot
 Neumann: The fuck is going on here
 MadKnight: wtfmann
 AntiSquid: Neumann
 MadKnight: i dunno someone mentioned u Neumann and then that escalated 
 Neumann: AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ya sorry, i pinged too late, wanted to join the spammers
 Neumann: Non.
 MadKnight: oh so that's who taught Automaton2000 to say that on #fr
 Automaton2000: yes, but i haven't done that one
 AntiSquid: scrolling up and reading chat, it's safe to safe the school kids don't deserve to be kicked anymore
 Astrobytes: Pfff. At least we had a theme.
 MadKnight: boring childish humour can't be compared to our fancy madmann word making
 icecream17: I just discovered javascript labels!
 AntiSquid: wow
 MadKnight: what do javascript labels do&#160;?
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/183161/whats-the-best-way-to-break-from-nested-loops-in-javascript">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/183161/whats-the-best-way-to-break-from-nested-loops-in-javascript</a> (first answer)
 MadKnight: an icecream playing with labels
 eulerscheZahl: same as for java
 MadKnight: oh, that kind of labels
 MadKnight: i thought of the wrong tihng
 kovi: lucky rolls
 inoryy: my eyes
 Astrobytes: labels... like um, goto labels?
 MadKnight: yea
 AntiSquid: i followed that example just because of the way it works, but it doesn't seem beneficial 
 AntiSquid: i mean i used it once
 MadKnight: i usually put those in a function to use return instead of outer break, icecream17
 icecream17: Yes, but the main for loop is inside a function, and there's an annoying "warning" symbol if I put a function iside a function
 MadKnight: what does this outer loop even do&#160;?
 icecream17: loop through possibleOpp
 MadKnight: what exactly does it do&#160;?
 MadKnight: i forgot that word again
 MadKnight: inoryy what word did u remind me to use instead of logically&#160;?
 MadKnight: maybe conceptually&#160;?
 MadKnight: icecream17 what does your loop do conceptually&#160;?
 icecream17: loop through each possibleOpp space, innerloop = loop through each "functs" (order of checks)
 MadKnight: but what's the point of this whole thing&#160;?
 MadKnight: what does it give u&#160;?
 MadKnight: what does it do in the end&#160;?
 icecream17: 100 possible positions -&gt; 75 possible positions
 MadKnight: what?
 icecream17: track opponent
 AntiSquid: MadKnight you would understand if you played the game
 MadKnight: and why do u need to break out&#160;?
 MadKnight: i did AntiSquid\
 MadKnight: but i kinda stopped at making a search
 icecream17: If a innerloop functions finds out "remove this function" then don't consider other checks
 AntiSquid: if you played it then you would know why you need to break out
 Astrobytes: Where is your bot MadKnight? When Silver MadKnight? Fix it MadKnight. ezpz MadKnight.
 icecream17: *"remove this possibleOpp"
 MadKnight: can't u just use built-in functions for that icecream17&#160;?
 MadKnight: arr.any() 
 AntiSquid: ah i thought you break out when you run out of time IceCarnivoreOfDeath_7fe6
 AntiSquid: icecream17 *
 AntiSquid: lol that username
 elderlybeginner: contest, surface - how to you nicely looping positions with sector?
 icecream17: Nooo...
 icecream17: possibleOpp[i] = 1 possible space.
 icecream17: Main for loop = i++
 icecream17: Inside = checks if possibleOpp[i] is good
 AntiSquid: icecream17 you are teaching him how to write a bot
 icecream17: Sigh... I give up
 icecream17: The reason is that 1 + 1 =3
 elderlybeginner: maybe dictionary with 1-9, connected with x,y limits?
 elderlybeginner: yep, thanks guys, that's good idea :P
 AntiSquid: ya there's a formula
 AntiSquid: check referee code elderlybeginner
 AntiSquid: forgot where it is

 Counterbalance: it's cleaned up since last i looked
 Illedan: Yeah, I did a refactorization to keep my santity Counterbalance.
 Tunga: SavinVadim you won me at real time while you wrote the code on youtube&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: Oh you've decoupled all the logic and viewer stuff now Illedan?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: And added tests
 Astrobytes: Nice
 Astrobytes: Bet that was soooo fun
 Illedan: Nope, but code rushed in 2 days keept me awake at night :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 icecream17: They're called sectors? I thought they were boxes....
 AntiSquid: sudokus
 elderlybeginner: python - any solution for range with complex numbers without spliting it on real and imag? 
 AntiSquid: not sure what you want
 Zenoscave: why use complex?
 AntiSquid: double the range? 
 struct: most islands i found so far is 99
 struct: Need moooore
 AntiSquid: or regular range and execute an operation on bot real and imaginary
 AntiSquid: i don't get it
 AntiSquid: share seed with 99 struct
 icecream17: struct what's the seed for 99 islands?
 MadKnight: hey Neumann
 struct: The map doesnt look bad
 AntiSquid: elderlybeginner if you think about it complex number could be just like using 2 for loops over a 2D array
 struct: There are maps with less islands that look way worse
 AntiSquid: share it
 elderlybeginner: yes, i'm using complex numbers instead of matrix (or list of lists)
 AntiSquid: or Automaton2000 visits you in your dreams struct
 Automaton2000: if you have more than one level.
 elderlybeginner: or 2d arrays, depends on lang :P
 struct: wait there is a bug in my map generator
 struct: is not counting islands properly
 struct: wtf
 struct: how did I miss this
 AntiSquid: so what exactly are you looking for elderlybeginner&#160;?
 icecream17: Ooh, I wonder what seed=icecream17 looks like
 lNitsua: are you able to move and silence the same turn?
 AntiSquid: yes
 icecream17: You can do any actions together on the same turn
 Zenoscave: yes IN
 elderlybeginner: doing it in pythonic way:for x in range(sector[i][0].real(), sector[i][1].real()):without spliting on real and imag
 lNitsua: ok, so something else is breaking everything
 elderlybeginner: where sector = {1:[0 + 0j, 4 + 4j], ...} 
 Zenoscave: elderlybeginner that is overly complicated for no advantage
 AntiSquid: maybe you just want a one dimensional array elderlybeginner&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and index it slightly differently
 elderlybeginner: nah, I'm keeping map data in distionary, where names are complex numbers, pretty useful for me for other operations
 AntiSquid: are you trying to find the sector formula or what elderlybeginner?
 elderlybeginner: yes, checking data in sectors
 elderlybeginner: I guess I will have to divide it on real and imag :shrugging_man:
 AntiSquid: int sx = ((sector -1)&#160;% 3) * 5;
 AntiSquid: and then just +4 each
 AntiSquid: for max value
 AntiSquid: mine probably not the shortest
 Zenoscave: or +2 for each for center with cheb distance
 AntiSquid: done it in a rush
 AntiSquid: or just save the starting points to array and then you kno where to iterate from
 elderlybeginner: right, much simpler to keep only one point, don't know why i put from ... to
 elderlybeginner: sectors are equal, I guess I wanted to be more independent, overly-independent
 AntiSquid: was imagining you do something more sophisticated
 elderlybeginner: sorry to disappoint you :wink:
 struct: ok my map generator was wrong
 icecream17: seed=icecream17 has 7 islands! I wonder if there's a better username?
 icecream17: oops i miscounted, there's actually 9 islands
 struct: icecream17 sorry to disapoint you
 struct: but letters dont work as seed
 icecream17: So it skips the letters?
 Zenoscave: it did for my name. in the runner
 JBM: or maybe you're just 0
 struct: yes Zenoscave but the seed is random everytime
 icecream17: I mean, seed=potato is different from seed=icecream, so I think it's converting it or something
 Zenoscave: huh
 struct: It doesnt generate the same map
 icecream17: oh
 AntiSquid: 1st of April today btw, nobody doing an April's fools, which is fine
 Zenoscave: that is the April fools
 JBM: isn't 1 april yesterday for most of the world?
 Tunga: The life itself have done some stuff, we have no energy for jokes 
 icecream17: At <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AApril_Fools">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AApril_Fools</a> the page itself is....
 struct: 123 islands -1425933
 struct: What would bots do on this map
 reCurse: I don't think we have the same definition of island
 struct: Is the definition in game
 struct: "Next height lines: a string of width chars representing the content of each cells of this row. x for an island, . for an empty cell."
 reCurse: Doesn't change my statement
 Kukiss: I was looking for 123 isolated (!?) island too..
 struct: It was clickbait title
 icecream17: I wish clickbait never existed
 Zenoscave: April Fools!
 struct: also 123 isolated would never be possible
 icecream17: Not by this code....
 struct: because minimum size for isolated island is 4
 struct: if its not in corner
 AntiSquid: struct this is still best seed: 156183823
 AntiSquid: beat this one
 icecream17: I like because some people will spawn at 14, 7
 struct: That one seems better sure
 struct: but has 122 islands
 struct: *lands
 icecream17: is lands
 Astrobytes: *122 land cells
 Zenoscave: *103 water cells
 AntiSquid: i don't see 123 in the one you shared
 Astrobytes: *0 air cells
 AntiSquid: and the earth is flat on it right? 
 Zenoscave: *2 players
 Astrobytes: Yea, icecream found the end of it yesterday
 AntiSquid: ah i didn't copy the '-' ... nice seed struct
 Valdemar: Hi. It is allowed to trigger mine the same turn it placed? It seems that game accept it, but mine not exploded. Here replay, turn 128 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444478100">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444478100</a>
 Zenoscave: no it should not be allowed
 Astrobytes: No
 AntiSquid: i win vs wlesvo on these odd looking big island maps, we should make them the norm
 Astrobytes: Valdemar "You can't trigger multiple mines in the same turn. You can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn."
 Counterbalance: ahhh why not
 Valdemar: Astrobytes thanks, this is very sad. I dreamed about dash with superflous damage
 struct: I also think it should be a thing
 struct: would be good to chain with silence
 AntiSquid: torpedoes should blow up mines
 Astrobytes: It would completely change everything
 Zenoscave: You could theortically get someone in one turn then
 Astrobytes: Both of those would
 AntiSquid: the original game blew mines up with torpedoes and imo it makes a lot more sense that way + it's a good counter to mines
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It would kinda turn into UTG
 Counterbalance: exploding mines don't affect other mines either right?
 icecream17: I mean, I lost in turn 1 quite a few times....
 Zenoscave: Astro you mean CR?
 struct: no Counterbalance
 struct: Mines are explosion proof
 Astrobytes: Yeah Zenoscave :D
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 icecream17: Ooh.. what if the map was a torus?
 icecream17: Go left through the wall and end up on the right
 AntiSquid: then it wouldn't be able to stay on the turtle's back
 Astrobytes: Then it would be a toroidal map...
 AntiSquid: oh wait it would stay on the turtle's back
 AntiSquid: torus is much better idea
 AntiSquid: let's redo the game
 Zenoscave: Pocean of Pikapchta
 Andragol: hello there is a key combination to indent automatically?
 Zenoscave: yes. tab
 Astrobytes: *Ocean Detective
 wlesavo: Ocean of Ktulhu
 ZarthaxX: *the combination*
 AntiSquid: i just use tabs and press enter at the end of the line .
 icecream17: Alt+2020 or Σ
 icecream17: Yeah, use tav
 struct: Imagine coding on multiple lines
 icecream17: *tab
 Zenoscave: ø/
 struct: Use only 1 line
 Zenoscave: Ø/
 struct: Then you have no problems
 AntiSquid: you can do that struct. you hold CTRL and click select multiple lines&#160;!!
 AntiSquid: then you code multiple lines at once!
 struct: No
 struct: 1 line
 struct: its better for performance
 <b>**Astrobytes starts writing perl</b></p><p><img src="/a/16732569385856" /> Zenoscave: No 0 lines
 icecream17: You can ctrl+f and type in each space!
 icecream17: Oh yeah? I can do better than 0 lines. Better than -1 too. Even -infinity and sqrt(-1)...
 AntiSquid: and ctrl+h to replace the space with some code?
 icecream17: I can do.... a watermelon amount of lines
 Astrobytes: Complex coding with imaginary lines?
 struct: Just enable regex on Ctrl+h
 struct: type replace .
 icecream17: Okay, press Ctrl+F, type space, and then press Ctrl+Enter, then type "Yay!"
 struct: and press all
 AntiSquid: does it improve performance?
 icecream17: It improves by -Infinity.
 struct: It becomes faster than D
 Astrobytes: Nothing is faster than The D
 Zenoscave: Tenacious D?
 AntiSquid: not even light traveling through absolute vacuum
 Astrobytes: Was more like Rapacious D with the D fanbois that got it approved on here :D
 AntiSquid: D &gt; TypeShit anyday
 wlesavo: Dear Rodney
 Astrobytes: I thought you could already use typescript on CG with a hacky thing anyway
 Valdemar: Astrobytes what UTG stands for?
 AntiSquid: crystal rush
 struct: unleash the geek aka Crystal Rush
 Zenoscave: lol
 Astrobytes: Valdemar Crystal Rush
 AntiSquid: but misspelled
 Astrobytes: lel
 wlesavo: as in crUsTall Gush
 Astrobytes: Ewwww, that sounds... wrong 
 Valdemar: I missed that one
 AntiSquid: crystal rush was sort of similar to this one
 AntiSquid: hidden info game all over again
 reCurse: CG just love their incomplete inputs
 icecream17: error: complier no UndersTandinG
 icecream17: Oh no... the Error screen shows "M" 1988 times with "..."
 AntiSquid: rick and morty back on 3rd of May <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPDqQDTnJKE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPDqQDTnJKE</a> doesn't look like an April's fool
 Astrobytes: Didn't even catch up with the last season tbh
 icecream17: What? I put "slice" instead of "splice"? Ohhhhhhhhhhh
 icecream17: I beat deafult on the first try!
 icecream17: My code works again! finally
 icecream17: For javascript, can variables outside of functions and loops be declared by "let" instead of "var"?
 icecream17: I think so....
 adoxography: Yes.
 ThePythonian: Hey, does anyone here still use Java?
 Zenoscave: many people
 Uljahn: also 3 billion devices and Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it is on the other side of the map
 MustafaReda: Hi 
 MustafaReda: any one to clash&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: MustafaReda there is a competition currently. Most people will be doing that
 MustafaReda: ok thanks I already got it 
 SamuelCarinhas: YEET
 lordvidex: Anyone using Dart?
 icecream17: Playing against myself.... both players said "True" for the array that checks if there are 0 possibleOpp positions.
 icecream17: this bug is complicated
 icecream17: anyone there?
 icecream17: Turns out "finally" is actually something

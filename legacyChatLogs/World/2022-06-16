 WS1: fas hakma l 3alam
 waterproofsodium: AbrahamJLR there is really no point in stating it's not logical and bring subjective arguments. You obviously are bringing reasons why you personally believe it should be that way
 Westicles: paralympics is a horrible analogy.
 waterproofsodium: so is you bringing up sports
 Westicles: you can make up any analogy you like where rules need to be changed because someone is too lazy too compete properly
 waterproofsodium: are you trying to offend me?
 waterproofsodium: you could just mention arguments why you think it should be the way you think is right. like real arguments
 Ayza: shortest mode was created to make you learn python
 Ayza: case closed
 waterproofsodium: I assume you made a joke
 waterproofsodium: My main argument here is that for a meaningful competition there should be winning requirements of real value and I constantly fail to see that in "code shortness"
 waterproofsodium: when it comes to finding quality in code shortness: readability may first increase but if you compress your code too much it decreases again
 waterproofsodium: you may think ergonomics is relevant, but you have the same effect: if you try to make your code 30% smaller and rewrite some sections 5 times for that purpose it is not ergonomic
 waterproofsodium: Westicles: therefore my conclusion is that the "competition" you describe mostly has intrinsic value which you may value but I don't. I would really love for it to be possible to opt out of shortest code
 waterproofsodium: perhaps the argumentation gets through and this is added. would be great
 Westicles: I don't play clashes...
 Westicles: you should take your concerns to discord, some of the CG guys might read it there
 TimothyAlexisVass: Still today I find this so surprising that I had to share it again:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/FCXA4ft5Weo">https://youtu.be/FCXA4ft5Weo</a>The actual hypnosis happening through the screen.

 j4at: waterproofsodium
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yeah, I know Bob usually make shorter solutions in Ruby and Python but posts his C anyway.

 Westicles: shortest code has a long history.  thing of all those guys cramming pacman and galaga into 24 kB.
 Razovsky: coc is for practice. If you want competition, well, switch to ruby for shortest codes
 AbrahamJLR: Or perl.
 Westicles: whew, done.  somebody tell Stilgart his script is amazing
 Razovsky: go to #fr to tell him
 Westicles: heh heh, maybe
 Razovsky: anyoine has the 4th validator of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building</a>&#160;?
 Razovsky: i dont find the issue in my code
 Uljahn: yeah, i'll dm you
 Westicles: I sent him the link
 Razovsky: my code doesn't work if there is only one variable in brackets
 Razovsky: well, im stupid
 Razovsky: :P
 Razovsky: thanks all
 Razovsky: am doing parsing in C++, not the easiest way to solve the puzzle ^^
 GroutchKeu: o/
 AryanTripathi: sup pppls
 AryanTripathi: *ppls
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey AryanTripathi, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 4 tacos
 AryanTripathi: huehue
 emh: got 2 potentially good optimization ideas this morning but too tired to implement. idea one an AVX-parallel BFS and other one a huge lookup table
 jacek: why not both
 jacek: and i finally know why my thing is so faster
 jacek: no cache misses :3
 AryanTripathi: hey jacek are you alt of tinbaud lmao
 jacek: no?
 AryanTripathi: you both ppls pfp is almost same
 AryanTripathi: and also you both ppls level is almost same
 AryanTripathi: huehue so I thought
 AryanTripathi: nvm
 AryanTripathi: my bad
 AryanTripathi: Hey @Moderators, why not add a button to upload images? so that ppls can send issues they are struggling with?
 emh: jacek sure I will try out both
 eulerscheZahl: you have a clear misunderstanding of what moderators can and can't do
 eulerscheZahl: they can kick/ban users and ping staff. that's pretty much it
 Westicles: I guess they can delete messages on discord?
 AryanTripathi: ohh 
 AryanTripathi: sowy
 AryanTripathi: I thought they hve access to edit the website's code
 eulerscheZahl: also delete forum messages
 jacek: and 50% speedup in bt :tada:
 jacek: oops left the fixed seed
 herostoky: Hello World 
 Rui_Han: hon
 saeed_mirzakhani: Hi. Where i can see all the test that i done?
 jk_java: anyone interested in music notation?
 jk_java: I have a ClashCode contribution for transposition, might be fun, please upvote
 le_spammeur: Hello
 Ayza: saeed_mirzakhani, If you mean clashes then you can't
 Ayza: but you can for classic puzzles if you scroll down to the bottom for each difficulty
 sidproo: i have not been using codin game for 5 months
 sidproo: holy gawd
 sidproo: @eveyone
 sidproo: um
 jacek: :scream:
 sidproo: what
 sidproo: I CODE
 sidproo: les play
 Ayza: this isn't discord :slight_smile:
 Ayza: but who pinged
 sidproo: oh
 jacek: this is celestia
 sidproo: me
 jacek: An error occurred (#314): "Submitted code is too big". :rage:
 jk_java: thats what she said
 jacek: thats what she said
 jk_java: hi hi

 mljhuo: c
 anjengaer: yo
 CesareA: ye
 Harsh_Chourasiya: YOOOO 
 jacek: :green_heart:
 jacek: MSmits you there?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: your endgame generator doesnt work for me. it crashes
 jacek: i only need to implement ApplyMove?
 MSmits: well you need to have a sim and apply a move yeah
 jacek: also why loops end with house &lt; 11?
 MSmits: probably because if house is 11, then you just dump all leftover seeds
 MSmits: in that pit
 MSmits: that loop you are talking about calculates all ways of spreading seeds in pits
 MSmits: so when you get to 11 you have no choice but to dump the rest
 jacek: also, there are 2 ApplyMove functions but only one is used
 MSmits: ahh not sure why that is. By the way I am no longer that protective of my sim, i can submit a version that has the sim in it later, but first contest
 ajaxdion: hi
 jacek: i have the sim and i think i convert it properly from your bitboard to my gamestate
 jacek: but for some reason it crashes on int score = captured - netScores[(turnsLeft - 2) * stateCount + childIndex]; // minus 2 because it's a child and turnsleft starts at 1
 jacek: because (turnsLeft - 2) * stateCount + childIndex is negative
 MSmits: sounds like an off by 1 errpr
 MSmits: error
 jacek: :thinking:
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/926f8f07-59b9-43c2-a750-4534ce29dc0c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/926f8f07-59b9-43c2-a750-4534ce29dc0c</a>
 YurkovAS: jacek try this
 jacek: it works i think
 jacek: but there is reference to childBoard
 jacek: while at playground there is not
 jacek: so only should i return the captured seeds, but also change the board
 jacek: yeah, it works with my sim as well. theres a typo in your playground
 jacek: :neutral_face:
 MSmits: a typo?
 MSmits: it's possible i messed things up by taking my sim out
 YurkovAS: int ApplyMove(const int house, uint64_t &amp;childBoard, const int player)
 MSmits: yeah thats because i am applying the move to the childboard
 MSmits: that seems ok
 MSmits: i usually copy the parent board and then apply the move to it
 MSmits: the integer returns the captured seeds
 jacek: btw i again trained from scratch and pwned your book
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: still trying to figure out a way to solve the game
 MSmits: my problem now is that it's solving but taking too much space, so i need to remove childnodes that are not needed to prove the solve and do this regularly
 MSmits: otherwise I quickly use many GB
 MSmits: YurkovAS did you end up making my endgame book generator work for your bot?
 YurkovAS: as solver - no (i'm don't understand why)now use it as bonusi'm check it with mcts and alpha-beta, current bot is ab
 MSmits: ahh  ok, I can see if i can share the whole thing later on. Have to pick up my kid from school, but I have an hour. Could try to put the sim back in.
 MSmits: I'll just use my bot without the search and eval
 YurkovAS: *as solver endbook play bad for me
 darkhorse64: Is that endgame generator public&#160;?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58572/endgame-books-in-oware-abapa">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58572/endgame-books-in-oware-abapa</a>
 darkhorse64: Thanks. I just forgot about it
 jacek: on a bright side, i nearly double my rollouts in breakthrough using that thing i used in oware
 jacek: i was missing quite a cache
 darkhorse64: Stop improving your bots. I can't keep up
 tech_ninja: Hi 
 seanmabli: spam
 seanmabli: spam
 seanmabli: spam
 seanmabli: spam
 seanmabli: spam
 jacek: oh my
 JirkaS: I think that's a spam
 struct: hi
 MSmits: just to be safe, do you guys think it is ok to share my oware sim to make the endgame book generator playground work completely?
 MSmits: it will only lack the part with pits with seeds &gt; 31
 jacek: i'd just fix the typos
 MSmits: it will not have a search and eval
 MSmits: what typos?
 jacek: remove unused int ApplyMove(int house, uint64_t&amp; board) 
 jacek: add reference to childBoard in int ApplyMove(int house, uint64_t childBoard, int player)
 struct: and rename functions that start with uppercase
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: haha no, I use C# style&#160;:)
 seanmabli: spam
 seanmabli: spam
 seanmabli: spam
 MSmits: jacek that reference is missing?
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: if you changed it, youd need to reset that snipsset
 MSmits: i guess thats because the sim part doesnt actually work anyways?
 MSmits: but what i meant was, is it giving too much away for new players to share my sim?
 jacek: Marchete shares a lot more and he lives
 MSmits: I'd prefer to just share the working thing. It's not a finished bot anyways. 
 jacek: probably only hardcore oware players looks at that playground anyway
 MSmits: mostly i want to show how to generate endgame books in general
 Illedan: Don't share too much!
 MSmits: what is too much is my question
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: this is comparable to magus sharing csb sim
 Illedan: Playground sharing for that would be fine
 MSmits: it's basically the oware sim (95% of it) with an endgame book generator. There's nothing else in there. No working bot, no mcts search, no eval functiom
 MSmits: function
 Illedan: Sounds good&#160;:) Ship it!
 MSmits: kk&#160;:)
 MSmits: allright it's published
 MSmits: 200-240 ms it takes to get the 9 seed book
 struct: ill check after contest :p
 MSmits: aw damn, my distraction failed
 j4at: Yey I'm top 1 in Search race now&#160;:) Jk I'm 138th :p
 struct: do you have a replay?
 Illedan: nice j4at
 jacek: 13.1k, not so bad eh
 struct: this is the best my bot did
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641054548">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641054548</a>
 struct: on ide, I didnt do anything offline
 Illedan: Mine be like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641460664">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641460664</a>
 darkhorse64: You beat me by 5 s and still there is some jitter in your trajectory
 j4at: That's the worst test case for my bot
 Illedan: ^^
 darkhorse64: Full brakes on, yeah&#160;!
 Illedan: That was the funniest testcase to make :D
 struct: ga Illedan?
 MSmits: which testcase is this?
 struct: Line racing
 Illedan: Hold the line
 struct: or that
 Illedan: yeah, ga
 Illedan: 6 actions
 struct: yeah my ga also does poorly
 MSmits: here's mine: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641461306">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641461306</a>
 MSmits: it's my csb bot basically. I just pasted it in, no modification
 Illedan: Spawn enemies outside the map or something?
 darkhorse64: Uncle Smits driving, no worries
 MSmits: I have no license&#160;:)
 MSmits: Illedan i just used the runner code
 darkhorse64: That shows
 MSmits: :grin:
 j4at: Well I trained my NN on randomly generated games for 1/4 the time I train it for tests because I'm tired of waiting for hours. Im training it now on validators&#160;;)
 MSmits: if the validators are known, you have to use some kind of persistent program that can run for days and is always getting better, like a meta mcts for opening book generation in board games
 MSmits: can you guys make something like that?
 j4at: THat's exactly what I was thinknig about
 MSmits: yeah, i am just wondering about how to code that
 j4at: I will maybe do it after the event
 MSmits: I am used to discrete movesets
 MSmits: Maybe the moveset expands like a chokudai?
 MSmits: like first you do max angle and 0 and later on you go halve between them?
 darkhorse64: With so few actions, a BS looks better
 struct: yeah chokudai was worse for me here
 MSmits: Yes in short term darkhorse64, but what if you spend 1000s of hours running it
 MSmits: you will miss good moves by discretizing too much
 darkhorse64: Probably yes, I have 5 moves
 darkhorse64: I tried to have more but it was not better (in my limited search time)
 MSmits: that makes sense, it is the same in CSB
 darkhorse64: I picked the idea somewhere on the forum where someone (magu s&#160;?) said (0,0) was non sensical as a move
 MSmits: btw, i wasn't talking about chokudai exactly. I meant more like, using  a meta mcts where you expand a node to include more moves if it gets more visits
 MSmits: yeah i exclude a lot of nonsensical moves
 MSmits: also nonsensical: go left without power, then next turn go right without power
 MSmits: mmh seems like i do include 0,0 in some cases. 
 MSmits: gonna try without it
 struct: what made the biggest difference for me was the suggestion jacek gave me
 MSmits: what was that?
 struct: pos.distance(checkpoins[ncid]-vel)
 struct: the - vel
 MSmits: what do you use that for?
 struct: so i do ncid * 50000 - pos.distance(checkpoints[ncid]-vel)
 struct: for eval
 MSmits: this is basically -3 vel for eval?
 MSmits: why not add a factor of 3?
 MSmits: I guess you should make it a parameter and just fit
 struct: it should also work yeah
 MSmits: it makes a lot of sense to me that a heuristic that works with a simple bot, also works as an eval in a tree search
 darkhorse64: Actually 3 is not good for a SR heuristic bot IIRC 
 MSmits: nah, i guess you just need to fit the param
 Crosility: Good Morning!
 MSmits: I resubmitted my csb bot excluding the 0,0 move
 Uljahn: "to include more moves if it gets more visits" - looks similar to Elastic MCTS <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15126">https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15126</a>
 MSmits: elastic fantastic
 MSmits: will study it later thanks&#160;:)
 YurkovAS: i'm exclude 0-0 when no shield in depth 0+
 MSmits: ohh yeah it seems that is what i was doing also
 YurkovAS: if shield&#160;!= 0 -&gt; add 0-0 move
 MSmits: should i have it with shield?
 Wontonimo: In Elastic MCTS, the nodes of the tree are clustereddynamically, first grouped together progressively by state abstraction, and then separated when an iteration threshold isreached -- so cool.  that's a great idea
 Wontonimo: thanks for sharing Uljahn&#160;!
 YurkovAS: with shield&#160;!= 0 my moves:18|0, -18|0, 0|0in depth0 add 1 additional move: shield
 MSmits: right
 jacek: hyped for something in 30 minutes?
 MSmits: *something*
 jacek: could it be hex board?
 MSmits:&#160;!
 Illedan: Please no hex board
 struct: please no fog
 Magus: hex board + fog
 darkhorse64: From the YT shorts, it looks a bit like C4L
 jacek: enhasa
 darkhorse64: is that polish for despair&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: from youtube it looks like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/19749e3c7941292b90f1bd77005c29eabd039">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/19749e3c7941292b90f1bd77005c29eabd039</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but that has nothing to do with the environment, so it's probably a red hering
 jacek: it has. you need to make NN, you need to use 1000 GPU to train it
 jacek: and only use electricity from coal
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: what about liquid gas?
 jacek: disqualification

 eulerscheZahl: astro doesn't trust me&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: no I did watch it in the end
 emh: he trusts me. especially with CSB
 Astrobytes: emh :rofl:
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: CSB will never be the same for me again
 Astrobytes: likewise
 struct: you dont want to know jacek
 jacek: i want!
 struct: pm him emh
 eulerscheZahl: he changed some sprites
 emh: it's forbidden knowledge
 TimothyAlexisVass: Hahaha, first time I've seen that one with the cat
 jacek: MSmits endgame generator appears to be working. locally my bot is stronger with one than without
 Astrobytes: what was the issue jacek?
 jacek: smits removed reference from board in function
 Astrobytes: d'oh
 jacek: but now uploaded to playground full version with sim
 Illedan: hi emh
 emh: hi Illedan
 MSmits: good to hear jacek
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits, Illedan
 MSmits: hi Astrobytes
 jacek: :taco: MSmits
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry but you can only award tacos once per day
 DomiKo: 4K registered
 struct: so NN + book jacek?
 TimothyAlexisVass: :taco: MSmits
 antiwonto: [auto] TimothyAlexisVass has awarded MSmits 10 tacos. MSmits now has 42 taco. TimothyAlexisVass now has 24 taco
 MSmits: thanks TimothyAlexisVass
 TimothyAlexisVass: :v::expressionless:
 jacek: its way over codesize limit. but im gonna use it to train
 Astrobytes: nice
 j4at: :taco: struct
 MSmits: yeah, you can minify it too
 antiwonto: [auto] j4at has awarded struct 9 tacos. struct now has 62 taco. j4at now has 10 taco
 Westicles: :taco: AntiSquid
 antiwonto: [auto] Spread the love.  Give tacos to someone else, not someone you spam with tacos.

 eulerscheZahl: can we just enjoy the contest and retire that taco bot?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/mV7IEas.png">https://i.imgur.com/mV7IEas.png</a>
 aCat: anjoy the contest :D
 aCat: *enjoy ;p
 eulerscheZahl: i hope the game is worth it, let's see
 jacek: enjoy the hex board game
 j4at: I will take look at the event and then sleep :p
 Astrobytes: cards &amp; hex board or something
 Westicles: rollouts or no rollouts, that is the question
 jacek: trollouts!
 eulerscheZahl: aren't you in the same timezone as me, j4at?
 eulerscheZahl: not even I go to bed that early
 Astrobytes: I searched boardgamegeek far and wide but couldn't find anything to match
 j4at: Well my sleep schedule is very messed up rn
 jacek: it will gave start-up! graphics
 Crosility: Card game?
 aCat: probabloy card gamne
 Astrobytes: jacek :D
 aCat: was on the movie
 Astrobytes: Trouble typing today aCat? :P :D
 aCat: faster type than think ;p
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 struct: well it seems card
 struct: gl
 eulerscheZahl: lots of starter code, violates CG's game design rules :P
 Astrobytes: actually does remind me of start-up
 jacek: kinda 3d graphics
 Nerchio: Technical Debt lol
 Astrobytes: c4l similarity confirmed
 Westicles: ain't nobody gonna read all that
 aCat: no debug view?
 struct: so the game is the one they were playing
 dbdr: people already above the boss :D
 MindController: The given code beats boss
 dbdr: random
 ne.ascorbinka: random goes brrr
 MSmits: looks 3D-ish yeah
 Razovsky: the given code beats Jacek 
 Razovsky: XD
 jacek: i have the same code
 Razovsky: man, 75 input lines, this is a book
 Razovsky: XD Jacek i didnt even read the input
 Razovsky: WOW i beat euler too, what a time to be alive
 MindController: Straight to bronze with random i guess
 Razovsky: will ot last, let me enjoy these things
 Razovsky: not*
 Crosility: Lol to all the people submitting "Random"
 MSmits: where's my hexboard&#160;:(
 HerrHagner: Yea. Thats fun :D
 Razovsky: random -&gt; top 20
 Nikgame: random op
 MSmits: man, I have no idea how this game works at first glance. I think I need to reread this description like 10 times
 struct: you and me
 Nerchio: you and you and me
 Nikgame: ++
 Astrobytes: yep
 Tiger-The-Cat: this is one of the more complicated events
 darkhorse64: me too
 Tiger-The-Cat: all i know is that there is some sort of hiring involved in this game
 Nerchio: but I don't mind tbh, not every game needs to be 5 min coding rush to bronze
 Tiger-The-Cat: that is all I know
 MSmits: I suspect when I simplify all the wordy things into bits, it will become more clear
 Nerchio: :joy:
 Nerchio: not again
 Astrobytes: literal bits :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Yea, I just got here, was like wth
 Tiger-The-Cat: i suspect when i convince someone to explain this to me, I will finally understand this
 Nerchio: get your ints ready MSmits
 MSmits: indeed&#160;:)
 DomiKo: uints*
 MSmits: yes, my uber ints
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: is this game easier to understand if you are a professional developer?
 MSmits: I dont even know what technical debt is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like a probability finder, might need some floats...  :tropical_drink:
 MSmits: floats have bits too
 Nikgame: im learning c with this challenge
 Nikgame: will be fun
 MSmits: depends on your definition of fun
 MSmits: suspect it might be opposite to mine
 Sarstan: Oh man, a deck building game.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: C ₂H ₅OH
 MSmits: is that really a correct description? aren't you drawing cards and using them?
 MSmits: dechbuilding is like locam where you make a real deck
 Astrobytes: or when you build ships
 therealbeef: the draw pile and discard pile is your deck, as i understand it
 MSmits: true that too
 waterproofsodium: hi MSmits
 [SG]Sebastien: your deck is your draw pile, your discar pile and your hand
 MSmits: hi
 waterproofsodium: how do you do
 MSmits: I do confused
 Westicles: like reading the fine print on the back of your boat mortgage
 waterproofsodium: hm I assume that might not be a bad state necessarily
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: this game is unrealistic. whats code review for?
 therealbeef: to bash on colleagues you dont like
 MSmits: is it safe to assume i can just give all these types an array index
 DomiKo: yeah
 DomiKo: and then bitboard it
 MSmits: well i just want to get rid of all this wordy stuff
 [SG]Sebastien: yes, arrays work fine
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5400595-0092-4af3-bf0c-8c7873ebb929">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5400595-0092-4af3-bf0c-8c7873ebb929</a>
 MSmits: this is all equivalent?
 MSmits: only different typeS?
 Crosility: You don't like 20 character variable names? :P
 MSmits: no&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: just function names&#160;;)
 MSmits: oh yes, they must be long to be understood
 Crosility: GetTheSolutionToLife(void);
 struct: will we have mirrored games in legend?
 jacek: swap rule
 DomiKo: mirrored games will do anything?
 DomiKo: you random deck each round
 struct: Its more that if we go p1 and p2 against same player
 struct: I havent read the statement yet
 emh: this game seems not fun. I think I'll pass. probably
 struct: I will play
 Astrobytes: doesn't seem too bad, just very wordy statement
 struct: it has no fog I cant complain
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: you have full information on opponent?
 jacek: it has only chance element, like backgammon
 [SG]Sebastien: you have the full deck of the opponent. But you don't know what he has in hand
 MSmits: hmm ok so there's your fog struct&#160;:)
 emh: the location of the card list. It can be HAND, DRAW, DISCARD or OPPONENT_CARDS (AUTOMATED and OPPONENT_AUTOMATED will appear in later leagues)
 Illedan: And the board is hex shaped ish
 Astrobytes: not terribly foggy
 Illedan: Damn, this has almost the same amount as input as BOTG
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's the Octagon...like the movie
 MSmits:  i will be happy if i am able to reproduce the random move function without using it
 MSmits: that's my goal for tonight
 Astrobytes: well the legal moves are given, so...
 Illedan: I will be happy to have a better random than MSmits tonight
 struct: I just hope it has SecureRandom
 Miki09: For today I am happy with this: class application: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2340932a-f56a-4734-88c8-2ae01d96cf4a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2340932a-f56a-4734-88c8-2ae01d96cf4a</a>
 MSmits: Astrobytes i meant generating legal moves myself and then using them
 MSmits: like a proper sim
 aCat: no full rules in pdf...:/
 Astrobytes: I know :P
 blasterpoard: is the referee somewhere on github?
 MSmits: o
 jacek: h
 StevenV: so this won't provide source code like other multis&#160;:(
 Illedan: Won the boss :tada:
 MSmits: everyone has Illedan :P
 Illedan: oh
 [SG]Sebastien: referee is available, but you have the link in bronze league
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 StevenV: nice :D
 blasterpoard: could the link get posted, so that I know whether I should bother with going to bronze?
 Illedan: I'll send it to you. Just give me 5 hours

 DomiKo: legend
 struct: bosses public
 struct: maybe not
 DomiKo: random = new Random(seed);
 DomiKo: no secure?
 Karang: shhh
 jacek: they didnt have code review cards
 DomiKo: yeah I guess
 DomiKo: too much technical debt
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.boredbutton.com/random">https://www.boredbutton.com/random</a>
 therealbeef: ship the minimal viable product
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm out
 jacek: struct where is your bitboard
 struct: i havent started yet jacek
 Nikgame: can there be multiple applications at the same time&#160;?
 Nikgame: because implementing that in c is horror
 DomiKo: jacek going hard
 DomiKo: I pushed me down&#160;:(
 jacek: -That. -She
 jacek: woah wood1
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo 04:52ᴾᴹrandom = new Random(seed);no secure?
 eulerscheZahl: I wrote this comment for a reason&#160;:(<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/19749e3c7941292b90f1bd77005c29eabd039">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/19749e3c7941292b90f1bd77005c29eabd039</a>
 [SG]Sebastien: sorry, I had other bugs to fix. And you cannot know how many randows where used during the opponent's turn
 eulerscheZahl: you underestimate some of our members i think
 Astrobytes: indeed
 jacek: can you the that port mortem?
 Astrobytes: jacek making sense as per :P
 Karang: not fair play :p
 jacek: Automaton2000 taught me
 Automaton2000: darkhorse64 is eligible for prizes
 eulerscheZahl: karang i count on you&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: but this time it's integers
 Astrobytes: yeah, get to it&#160;:)
 MSmits: yay darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: new phone for you darkhorse64, the robot said so
 Karang: yeah that's definitely harder than with doubles
 Karang: still doable, but it is worth it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: to prove a point, yes, otherwise, debatable 
 eulerscheZahl: definitely worth it, if you manage to pull it off
 darkhorse64: I already have one
 eulerscheZahl: more than for spider spawns i'd say
 Astrobytes: true
 jacek: yeah, its like cracking 2048 seed
 MSmits: darkhorse64, but when someone asks you how you got it, you will be humiliated by having to answer you paid for it
 Astrobytes: maybe he stole it
 StevenV: the starter deck for Java is a joke&#160;:(
 MSmits: ahh yes, that's better
 StevenV: *the starter kit
 jacek: dont use java [solved]
 darkhorse64: mine is so cheap that its price is lower than reconditionned ones
 aCat: ok we nned to have a debug view
 aCat: no idea what applications are active
 aCat: no idea what application was released by the player
 MSmits: I've never owned a smartphone
 aCat: mee too MSmits&#160;;]
 MSmits: cool 
 darkhorse64: I think I'll have to write a real bot to get out of the woods. Usually play actions[0] is ok
 darkhorse64: reminds me of ooc
 Crosility: 2 People in Bronze from using Random. Hahahaha.
 aCat: yeah, I have so far no idea on oneliner to skip leagues&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: you can prioritise certain actions over others
 square1001: Hi, could you tell me how to ask question about the understanding of the problem?
 aCat: they were just fast enough
 jacek: what problem?
 square1001: Green Circle, of course&#160;:)
 [SG]Sebastien: what did you not understand?
 square1001: I did not understand about the case when there are 2 or more bonus cards in hand
 [SG]Sebastien: in the picture to release an application?
 square1001: No. I'd show some example so please wait a moment
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg</a>
 struct: full rules I think
 [SG]Sebastien: I have to get my daughter from school, I'll be back in 30 minutes
 StevenV: ooc?
 MSmits: Ahh i did that before the contest [SG]Sebastien, it's all about planning :P
 aCat: struct&#160;:*
 square1001: Sorry, I may be misunderstood
 Astrobytes: Ocean of Code StevenV
 jacek: relax. no one understands this game yet
 MSmits: that's projection jacek
 MSmits: I understand the wordy things are actually numbers
 MSmits: so, i am way ahead of you 
 StevenV: ah
 jacek: are you in bronze?
 MSmits: no, i mean in my mind
 jacek: nab
 MSmits: :grin:
 Karang: eulerscheZahl don't worry they have until I figure out what we are supposed to do to patch it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the patch would be trivial
 eulerscheZahl: curious if they do it
 square1001: If there's card { 0, 2, 1, 8 (bonus), 3 } in the card and there's an app needing skill { 0, 2, 4 }, why can't we publish this app&#160;?
 Karang: tbh keeping track of all the shuffling the opponent is doing + the fact that it's integer makes things significantly harder
 eulerscheZahl: no excuses
 square1001: Solved. I completely misunderstood (the 5th app should have no shoodys)
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: jacek NN?
 Nikgame: Why did i do this in c
 MSmits: because fun
 struct: its too late to change now
 Astrobytes: C or delete
 MSmits: yeah, so much time wasted otherwise. gotta stick with it
 Nikgame: im still trying to parse the app into my struct array
 struct: Im still reading the statement
 MSmits: which is why you can't be parsed into
 MSmits: I redid the entire input, but still don't understand the rules
 MSmits: not many lines now though, much easier 
 struct: read it slowly MSmits
 struct: write it on paper
 struct: it gets easier
 MSmits: yeah good advice, will try
 struct: at least it does for me
 Illedan: MSmits read the board game rules
 Illedan: they are far better
 Nikgame: wait youre not coding with word???
 MindController: Struct arent u still reading statement?
 struct: Im reading the statement
 struct: writing it on paper
 MindController: And giving tips to MSmits :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: Nikgame i turned those big wordy things into numbers
 Astrobytes: lol MindController
 MSmits: training_cards_count = 0
 MSmits: as an index i mean
 MSmits: i just made an array[10] where the first index is the training_cards_count
 MSmits: second is coding cards count
 MSmits: etc.
 MindController: Anyone has full rules?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg</a>
 MSmits: are you forced to use shoddy skills?
 MSmits: say you have enough skills that are correct from cards
 Illedan: Should use valid skills first?
 MSmits: I am just wondering if shoddy is only used when needed to complete the app
 jacek: you cant use shoddy only in 5th app
 MSmits: oh you only have the technical debt thing during a turn
 MSmits: it doesnt carry over
 jacek: thats what my company thinks as well
 MSmits: I see
 eulerscheZahl: If the team arrives on the opponent's desk (or on a desk next to the opponent), they will disturb the opponent (they are noisy when they work).As an apology, the team must GIVE one skill card from their hand to the opponent (the team can choose which one).If they do not have any skill card in hand, they get 2 Technical Debt cards.
 eulerscheZahl: who gets the technical debt? me or the opponent?
 MSmits: the culprit  i guess
 Astrobytes: you get the tech  debt
 eulerscheZahl: i see, don't disturb&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: would be fun to spam your opponent with them
 VizGhar: I'm too old for this :D I dont understand rules fully
 VizGhar: I need to pick paper and pencil like in old times
 MSmits: well you're not the only one
 eulerscheZahl: When you release an application, your permanent skills are discarded.
 eulerscheZahl: not so permanent after all
 VizGhar: semipermanent rather... such an oxymoron
 VizGhar: Can I see those "Applications" in viewer?
 eulerscheZahl: don't be ridiculous
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i like how they kept to starting place in French
 eulerscheZahl: and task-prioritization
 Illedan: It is a SKILL phase, but it is called PLAY_CARD
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 aCat: VizGhar I afraid that no
 eulerscheZahl: overall the game looks fun enough to take off i think
 eulerscheZahl: a bit worried about RNG
 aCat: so vizualization is fancy but useless :crying_cat_face:
 Astrobytes: yeah it seems worth doing
 eulerscheZahl: ille going for bronze
 Illedan: Agrred
 Illedan: Ez
 Illedan: bye
 Illedan: Damn jinx
 jacek: MSmits will you ascii print this game?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641516640">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641516640</a>
 Nerchio: wait what
 MSmits: jacek no idea
 eulerscheZahl: great strategy when you are ahead
 DomiKo: how can I know if desk is empty or not?
 eulerscheZahl: you know the enemy location from inputs
 Nerchio: so you can just stall the game on training? :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: keep counting if a desk was visited 5 times
 Illedan: The collision rule when players move in sequence :D
 jacek: they both printh RANDOM?
 eulerscheZahl: should that be considered a bug in the game, Nerchio?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure right now
 Nerchio: I dont know rules in wood2 just randomly saw the replay
 Nerchio: but if its possible then yeah
 therealbeef: seems shoddy
 struct: so if I have 6 shody I can complete a small app?
 MSmits: seems so struct
 MSmits: btw, what is the significance of moving in 1 direction if you can jump to any desk?
 j4at: Rules are very confusing
 struct: read the french rules easy
 jacek: you need to go through poste administrator
 MSmits: what does that mean jacek, this takes you 1 turn?
 jacek: "This forces you to go through the administrative task desk when you move from the desk 7 to the desk 0."
 jacek: in bronze you need to gib them cards
 MSmits: ohhh
 Cray_Ray3: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https">https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/https</a>: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/648ae8fa-3fb7-44e6-ad47-4145c30d1293">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/648ae8fa-3fb7-44e6-ad47-4145c30d1293</a>
 Astrobytes: uhhh
 struct: no spam
 MSmits: so if i pick the release option that uses the fewest shoddy skills, i am already better than random?
 Illedan: Yeah, that took me to 3rd MSmits
 MSmits: hmm i can also keep drawing and wait to avoid using shoddy at all can't i?
 MSmits: wait no, you have to discard everything
 MSmits: these rules are so weird
 StevenV: how can I see the application list on screen?
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: its like you need to connect 4 things, but connecting 3 things will make you lse
 jacek: lose
 MSmits: jacek that sounds like an idea for a great game
 MSmits: better if it's on hex though
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: uhm
 Illedan: I can't know how many skill cards there are on each slot?
 Illedan: If the team goes through the administrative task desk (between the desks 7 and 0), they lose 2 skills cards from their hand (they can choose which ones).
 MSmits: what slots?
 Illedan: On the board
 Illedan: 0-7
 MSmits: o
 Illedan: Locations
 MSmits: well you don't get this as input it seems
 Illedan: And bronze rule make it impossible to know
 Illedan: -.-
 Nerchio: prepare your simulations
 [SG]Sebastien: @Illedan&#160;: you have 5 cards on each desk at the beginning. If you count the cards in your deck and in the opponent deck, you cna find it
 Illedan: Not if they pass the administrative desk?
 Illedan: As they lose 2 skill cards
 Nerchio: TRAINING (0). The team draws 2 cards and can play 1 more card from their hand.
 Illedan: [SG]Sebastien?
 Nerchio: so this will allow you to do infinite draw right?
 Anth: How do new people change avatar on CG?
 [SG]Sebastien: @Nerchio&#160;: if you have an empty draw and empty discard, yes it could
 [SG]Sebastien: @Illedan: the cards you lose go back to the board so the total is always 5
 Illedan: Yeah, but I can't know which cards the opponent discarded
 eulerscheZahl: Anth, that name sounds familiar. did you compete on riddles.io by any chance?
 Anth: mm, 3:rd
 [SG]Sebastien: when you receive your input, he has already discarded. So the total will still be 5
 eulerscheZahl: some pacman-like gamei won but never received my prize&#160;:(
 Anth: you and msmith before me iirc
 MSmits: me?
 eulerscheZahl: lazylump was 2nd, i don't think he's on CG
 Anth: I got a call from the company but never booked the meeting.
 eulerscheZahl: i told them via email that i only want the prize but no job (a bit more polite)
 eulerscheZahl: when i asked about the progress, they said they shipped it
 Anth:&#160;:)
 Nerchio: should have taken the job so you can get the prize
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure anymore if it's their fault tbhthinking of my RAIC tshirt+hoodie. german customs just sent them back without informing me
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the same happened to that arduino robot
 MSmits: Illedan did you go beyond random in other ways? I just did the change of selecting best release option, but didnt do much
 eulerscheZahl: i also chose where to move to
 eulerscheZahl: choose even
 Illedan: In release =&gt; do best cardin move =&gt; move position +1&#160;% 8else random
 eulerscheZahl: that's a bronze strategy already?
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Illedan: Sure
 eulerscheZahl: smits needs wood hints
 Illedan: That got me from Wood 2 to Bronze in 1 go
 eulerscheZahl: in bronze passing through 8 gives you a penalty
 MSmits: yes wood hints =)
 Nerchio: its more difficult in wood than it was in the past few contests 
 eulerscheZahl: *cough* Kutulu
 MSmits: I guess i will do the +1, maybe it'll help
 MSmits: ooc was worse
 eulerscheZahl: OOC was a month though
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: and for kutulu you probably don't think about the initial boss
 eulerscheZahl: final wood boss was promoted to silver boss, keeping players out of gold
 Anth: MSmits: could be. Did you score second?
 TheRapture: mad pod racing is the easiest
 eulerscheZahl: say that again when you face the neural networks on top
 MSmits: i dont participate outside CG
 MSmits: so i doubt it
 eulerscheZahl: you played vs Professor X. that was not on CG
 MSmits: it was CG-inspired
 TheRapture: my skills litteraly neural network and multi agent
 MSmits: seems like the move +1 thing helps somewhat
 Illedan: [SG]Sebastien the bug from Nerchio is very annoying. I think you should disallow it on empty discard pile
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641531488">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641531488</a> hello Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: or don't allow chains
 MSmits: shoult report on forum
 MSmits: should
 Nerchio: i wish my bot was doing it in winning positions
 eulerscheZahl: shout it on the forum
 Nerchio: but it is what it is :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: illedan is working on the forum post
 TheRapture: is there anybody who knows Rust
 struct: how is that happening Nerchio?
 Illedan: Drawing on empty pile
 Illedan: And then trying again
 Nerchio: you use training skill with 0 cards yeah
 Nerchio: in draw
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641532452">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641532452</a> draw with Illedan again
 TheRapture: can i play green circle with u guys
 struct: ah since the draw pile is empty when you train you draw that card again?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: maybe
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know
 eulerscheZahl: can you repeat the question
 TheRapture: bruh
 TheRapture: its chat not speech
 eulerscheZahl: which TV show intro?
 StevenV: +1?
 eulerscheZahl: malcolm in the middle
 jacek: :older_man:
 Nerchio: blocking draw on empty pile should fix the problem, shouldnt be that hard 
 ClosetAI: Is problem statement bad or I'm retarded not to understand it?
 MSmits: ClosetAI is this an exclusive or inclusive or&#160;?
 VizGhar: both
 ClosetAI: It is bad but i should still understand it
 ClosetAI: ok
 MSmits: there's just a lot of theme fluff thrown in there
 VizGhar: I dont understand it either, but giving internet voice, whether I'm retarded or not? ... thats retarded&#160;:)
 MSmits: if you get past that, the game is fairly simple
 MSmits: I think
 eulerscheZahl: i think all of us needed more than 1 read
 MSmits: I'll know for sure once I get past that
 eulerscheZahl: not saying that it's a bad statement, just some complexity in the game
 VizGhar: ah ok... I read it only once... mybe that's why
 MSmits: it's also counter-intuitive / unlike other games
 eulerscheZahl: also had to watch some replays frame by frame
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't fully understand the card pickup and movement
 ClosetAI: ok, why does it say about moving in certain direction if you can move anywhere?
 Illedan: Because if you move behind you, you lose skill cards
 MSmits: if you go back to 0 you pass a special office, in bronze this costs you cards
 Illedan: In bronze that is
 ClosetAI: where does it say it
 MSmits: in bronze description
 Nerchio: taxes get you everywhere 
 Illedan: If the team goes through the administrative task desk (between the desks 7 and 0), they lose 2 skills cards from their hand (they can choose which ones).
 MSmits: btw, ClosetAI let us know when you got your card order figured out so we can steal it :grin: 
 Illedan: LOL
 Illedan: Yeah, please print the message
 ClosetAI: I'm not going to compete most likely
 StevenV: +1 and still in wood 2&#160;:(
 MSmits: I'm just glad you are here so i could make that joke&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: don't you need a new phone?
 eulerscheZahl: or an old phone
 MSmits: oh yeah, that too
 Illedan: I need a new one
 MSmits: get a new phone ClosetAI, there's 3 so i dont mind if you beat me
 ClosetAI: They don't ship stuff to my country&#160;:(
 MSmits: sucks&#160;:(
 MSmits: but hey, you can always give them my adress
 StevenV: +1 and still 280+
 StevenV: in wood 2
 MSmits: seems the boss is better than random?
 MSmits: I'm still only 16th with Illedan's advice
 MSmits: I think I need to move smarter
 JohnyDaison: you
 Nerchio: Avoiding your opponent is good otherwise you have to give skill cards
 MSmits: in wood?
 Nerchio: wood1
 MSmits: I am in wood 2
 Nerchio: :grimacing:
 MSmits: i thought i could get out of it by picking smart release and doing move +1
 MSmits: but no luck
 StevenV: wood 2 is string
 StevenV: strong
 Reorso: its java the only language where the initial variables are initialized in loops and you cant access them where you need them?
 struct: How do you know that they dont ship ClosetAI?
 StevenV: unlike recent CG challenge
 Illedan: OH
 struct: Who is shipping the prize, CG or SG?
 Illedan: I can only use skills based on cards in hand -.-
 Illedan: Didn't realise
 Illedan: xD
 MSmits: wow
 ClosetAI: I've received t-shirts but not expensive prizes
 ClosetAI: didn't even know there was a prize
 ClosetAI: so during release you always have 5 cards?
 MSmits: seems so
 Netsmile: lol
 Netsmile: exiting clash of code in the last second made me leave the room, but I still participated as a ghost and got minus points for being last
 struct: only noticed now that random is being given on possible moves
 Illedan: Oh, I know the opponent total cards. and not his hand. My bd Sebastian
 MSmits: seems like i am drifting to top wood 2
 MSmits: 7th now
 VizGhar: i got to wood 1... no idea how :D
 VizGhar: just guessed scoring
 MSmits: scoring?
 Wontonimo: Due to covid-19, Management enforced a one way path in the office so as not to bump into other people. You must always move in the same direction.  --&#160;?!?  wth
 eulerscheZahl: i expected Westicles to complain about that line
 Illedan: :D
 Wontonimo: what a convoluted game
 struct: im almost finishing reading statement
 Illedan: The p1 Advantage is so damn crazy
 struct: Wontonimo I found something you might like, Ill pm you
 saeed_mirzakhani: Guys, How can i see all the test that i did before?
 eulerscheZahl: what is it struct, the CSB interpretation by emh?
 struct: no lol
 eulerscheZahl: you asked that question before saeed_mirzakhani. but it makes no sense to me
 VizGhar: you can see submissions in History tab while in IDE... but only submissions
 tobk: I don't get it... in wood 2, you _have to_ release an app as soon as possible, even if that means using shoddy skills?
 saeed_mirzakhani: Yes, i don't know if anyone answer to me or not, since i weren't here. I'm totally noob here, i did some tests and i want to see list of all things that i've done so far.
 eulerscheZahl: what's a test by your understanding?
 eulerscheZahl: we certainly have different things in mind for that word
 saeed_mirzakhani: I solved two puzzles. I wana see them again, Can i review my code that i did in a specific puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: tobk try using at most 1 shoddy, that should get you into bronze
 [SG]Sebastien: agree
 eulerscheZahl: go to the list of puzzles and scroll to the bottom
 VizGhar: im using at most 2 and im in top 10 in wood 1... so I agree with euler
 eulerscheZahl: alternatively: go to your profile page, click the "Level" to see where you got the XP from. there are links to the problems you solved
 tobk: I'd love to, but how? I MOVE to the skill I need most to complete the next App, then in the next turn it tells me I _have_ to release an app because I can, using shoddy skills? Then I get lots of technical debt, which then (according to the game info) is immediately discarded???
 eulerscheZahl: you can always WAIT
 tobk: ah, so then it switches back to MOVE.... thanks, did not consider this.
 eulerscheZahl: your DISCARD will move to DRAFT, when DRAFT is empty
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl and VizGhar? when you are saying at most 1 or at most 2 shoddy, do you mean waiting instead of release?
 VizGhar: +
 MSmits: oh i never even considered that
 saeed_mirzakhani: There are some information in Level section. But i can't see any part that redirect me to IDE page. I want to review the code that i've done in a specific puzzle. Is it possible?
 StevenV: rank 20 wood2&#160;:(
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d829967-71de-4788-918a-ac22ac3f9a34">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d829967-71de-4788-918a-ac22ac3f9a34</a>
 StevenV: I wonder if I just resubmit then I can go to wood 1
 MSmits: thanks VizGhar
 Illedan: 1st :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: saeed_mirzakhani did you do puzzles or clashes?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>scroll to the bottom, you might find some solved there
 VizGhar: we have a winner already :D congrats Illedan :D
 StevenV: mine is quite the same
 MSmits: :iphone: :arrow_forward: Illedan
 saeed_mirzakhani: 2 puzzles and 5 clashes. I wana see the code that i've done.
 StevenV: I just use &gt;= 4
 StevenV: the other is +1 thing isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: for clashes: you can see the code again (click the bell icon and dig through notifications)
 eulerscheZahl: you can't officially get back to the clash itself again
 VizGhar: In case of move phase I just print first possible move (always next cell)
 eulerscheZahl: search it here if you have some memories<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 saeed_mirzakhani: User experience of the website is aweful.&#160;:(
 saeed_mirzakhani: Thanks.
 StevenV: thanks, it a lot like +1 thing
 eulerscheZahl: try some other websites, it will change your mind
 MSmits: clashes just aren't meant to be reviewed
 eulerscheZahl: CG is top notch when it comes to multiplayer games
 VizGhar: MSmits WAIT simply stores the card into your pile without any bad consequences... so you should assume using it
 MSmits: yeah, so that you dont rack up debt right\/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: right
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: in bronze it gets harder to avoid debt
 NinjaDoggy: does the replay display the available applications anywhere?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 NinjaDoggy: ...
 pedrosorio: "Due to covid-19, Management enforced a one way path in the office so as not to bump into other people. You must always move in the same direction." - what does this mean? The simulation of random moves seems to allow moving to any desk
 eulerscheZahl:  ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 eulerscheZahl: gets relevant in bronze
 MSmits: people will keep asking this question
 pedrosorio: oops, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: penalty if you pass desk 8
 VizGhar: teach antiwonto to respond to that
 MSmits: antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] 'antiwonto' was defined as ' A bot, possibly assembled in Central America. Programming questionable '
 JohnyDaison: eulerscheZahl what have you done? will those lines continue forever?
 pedrosorio: "Each of those desks contains 5 skill cards at the beginning of the game" - do we receive the number of remaining skill cards at each desk in the input somewhere?
 eulerscheZahl: it already stopped, JohnyDaison&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you have to count the skill cards yourself
 eulerscheZahl: an oversight IMO
 MSmits: I don't understand what Training does
 struct: me neither MSmits
 struct: I was just gonna say I dont understand skills
 StevenV: pretty much the same code, but one in rank 280+, and other top 20&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: not understanding ++
 eulerscheZahl: i'll do that tomorrow with a fresh mind
 MSmits: you're just going to have to monte carlo the :poop: out of this one eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: you know me all too well :D
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i did for c4l, wasn't that bad
 eulerscheZahl: and here we have even less opponent interaction
 MSmits: worked for locam too
 [SG]Sebastien: Training&#160;: you draw 2 cards (so 2 more cards in your hand) and then you can play another card (so the PLAY_CARD phase comes again)
 eulerscheZahl: everything worked for locam
 MSmits: true
 [SG]Sebastien: it's useful if you have good cards in your draw pile
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: thnaks
 Nerchio: how do you monte carlo when you don't know next round draw?
 eulerscheZahl: any thoughts about repetitive training?
 MSmits: Nerchio you monte carlo that too
 yu1679959321: well, but in python there will have a big different between rank 1 and rank 200
 eulerscheZahl: work with probabilities
 Nerchio: seems difficult especially in java haha
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, same with repetitive CODING
 eulerscheZahl: another loop?
 Illedan: Draw card too
 eulerscheZahl: replay?
 [SG]Sebastien: yup, but you draw only one card and can play 2 more cards
 Illedan: Still can make a loop
 Illedan: To force game to end
 [SG]Sebastien: yup
 Illedan: This should be fixed, else the contest will be ruined last minute
 eulerscheZahl: bug or feature?
 MSmits: is this game completely different when you are player 2? You can't know whether you can safely move to a desk because you dont know if p1 will be there
 eulerscheZahl: you have the opponent location as input
 Nerchio: its not simulatenous is it
 MSmits: oh right the opponent has already moved
 MSmits: i am used to these games being simultaneous.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm tempted to do some data scraping at the end of the contest to see how big p1 advantage is
 MSmits: wait, does your opponent train and move before you train and move?
 MSmits: skill i mean
 eulerscheZahl: and also RELEASE
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 VizGhar: oh... unexpected promotion
 MSmits: oh so his entire turn is done 
 MSmits: thats helpful
 StevenV: well only 50 account on wood 1
 eulerscheZahl: you still have a chance to play your turn when the opponent finishes the 5th app (when you are p2)
 MSmits: yeah i saw that
 eulerscheZahl: 39 in bronze, so?
 StevenV: I just thing the number is quite small for wood 1
 StevenV: *think
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl are you ignoring skill entirely?
 eulerscheZahl: it's only 3h into the contest, of course i ignore it
 Nerchio: StevenV it's because getting to wood1 is more tricky than usual
 MSmits: i am just wondering if you need it to get out of wood 1
 VizGhar: yeah... I'm just going for bronze first day... I'll go and rewrite it to C++ now that I vaguely understand what is going on
 Karang: 8/40 now starting to look into seed cracking :p
 VizGhar: looks like MCTS style game (and I haven't implemented MCTS successfully by now). So probably BEAM?... wonder how big the branching factor is
 MSmits: you need probabilities so i dont know if this can work
 VizGhar: So I'll beat the heuristic out of it :D
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see an argument against it
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, i do
 MSmits: you need a new state for every possible arrangement of cards
 eulerscheZahl: when it comes to the next deeper node in the tree, you don't even know your draft cards anymore
 VizGhar: probabilies will kill me here for sure
 eulerscheZahl: and testing all possibilities will explode hard
 VizGhar: true true... I give up :D
 struct: Just run multiple mcts
 MSmits: or a mcts that runs mcts
 eulerscheZahl: future me will find a way to deal with it
 jayden.o: YO
 jayden.o: the codin was hard
 VizGhar: I can't do MCTS. I was unsuccessful in UTTT and I dont have much time to even try it
 MSmits: well it's probably useless here
 MSmits: but you do need to find a way to deal with probability
 jayden.o: YO
 MSmits: VizGhar	if you got top gold in uttt with mcts, it might just be your bot wasnt very performant
 MSmits: not necessarily that the mcts was wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i was bottom legend, then found a bug in my node selection
 eulerscheZahl: fixed it and reach 50-ish at least
 MSmits: nice
 eulerscheZahl: was using total rollouts of root instead of parent
 VizGhar: It wasn't proper MCTS to be honest... I just randomly generated n games for each available nodes and scored them... no exploitation/exploration... no usb
 MSmits: that's a nasty bug
 MSmits: hard to find
 MSmits: VizGhar thats monte carlo!
 VizGhar: I dont even know what is euler talking about :D
 VizGhar: without UCB formula used? doubt it
 MSmits: no, i am telling you thats monte carlo
 Michael_Howard: Can we see the referee code anywhere? (Looks like it's not in the usual github.)
 MSmits: monte carlo&#160;!= monte carlo tree search
 Astrobytes: it's a flat monte-carlo search, no tree
 VizGhar: hmm then I'm proud of myself thank you
 VizGhar: oh aha
 MSmits: thats what you will need here
 MSmits: so you got skillz
 VizGhar: good to hear... still have to think this one through

 Michael_Howard: Thanks&#160;:)
 Scarfield: nooo i thought it started tomorrow xD
 eulerscheZahl: pay attention in elementary school when they teach calendars
 Astrobytes: hey Scarfield o/
 jacek: im no 1st in UTTT no more&#160;:(
 Scarfield: hi astro&#160;:)
 Scarfield: unfortunately im not in elementary school
 bluez00: HELLO
 MSmits: wow Scarfield not even in elementary yet. Little genius&#160;!
 Astrobytes: :D
 JohnyDaison: :grinning:

 Scarfield: lol jacek
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 JohnyDaison: that's a bit dark...
 Illedan: lol
 Scarfield: a little genius that mixes up the dates
 jacek: a savant
 StevenV: I think I will go to Bronze soon
 MSmits: wish i knew how, without doing the sim/search thing yet
 Scarfield: i have been called a Sedan once, bot that wasnt a compliment
 Scarfield: bot = but
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i thought maybe automaton called you a Sedan
 MSmits: it's not the worst thing he ever said
 Scarfield: am i a Sedan automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and i thought i would have to go through
 StevenV: any clue on whether we could use a sim for this game?
 MSmits: sure you can
 StevenV: really? with a lot of random and unknown thing?
 MSmits: also sim is very loosely defined. As soon as you use the input and calculate what happens when you try a move, to better make a choice, you are simulating
 StevenV: ah
 MSmits: perhaps you mean a structured search that uses simulation through multiple moves in a row
 StevenV: a sim without an algorithm attached to it
 MSmits: then yeah most likely you need one
 MSmits: based on probability
 StevenV: so you mean I can use a search that is based on probablility?
 StevenV: I am ggoling for it now
 Reorso: can anyone tell me what is the draw location guys? for the challenge
 JohnyDaison: probably your draw pile
 Reorso: i thought you draw cards only from the desks
 JohnyDaison: are you in Wood or Bronze?
 Reorso: wood
 JohnyDaison: Bronze has more rules
 Reorso: so are the desk card added to the draw pile or to your hand?
 HotWrestlerFromTheFuture_b2f4: hi
 Reorso: its to your hand in case anyone is interested
 struct: oh nice I got into bronze
 HotWrestlerFromTheFuture: i cant do this graphix too ugly
 HotWrestlerFromTheFuture: bye
 Reorso: im still puzzled about the rules XD
 Astrobytes: wtf is object_type
 MSmits: the type of the object
 Illedan: APPLICATION Astrobytes
 MACKEYTH: But the only objects are APPLICATIONS
 Illedan: Sure
 Illedan: But now you can't do it wrong
 Illedan: xD
 MSmits: lol
 JohnyDaison: it is a bit sus
 Astrobytes: so its a useless input
 Illedan: Legay
 MSmits: i never realized there was a useless property
 Illedan: *legacy
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Illedan: That will be a LOT OF useless data saved by the CG servers
 eulerscheZahl: when i read the first lines, i thought APPLICATION had something to do with recruiting
 Illedan: Me2
 Scarfield: #
 MSmits: makes sense
 Illedan: Thought the Goal part of the statement was recruiting info
 Scarfield: is it just me or are the rules pretty scarce with info?
 struct: after reading the rules I still dont understand how loops happen
 StevenV: loops?
 Illedan: Rules are written late in the process for this one
 jacek: struct you should hire the guys to write the statement for backgammon
 Julian_Dixon: How is this website supposed to teach coding? I took (and passed) a computational physics course where the first two weeks were supposed to be teaching us python in its entirety and after a that and a couple games of clash of code I know how to mulitply numbers by 2/3
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the fr statement is better?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not. you are supposed to have basic programming knowledge already when coming to CG
 Scarfield: there is a lot of mumbo jumbo about it being an IT dev team, but im not getting the rules yet, also the tutorial is only in french?
 jacek: and try puzzles. clashes are time limited
 Julian_Dixon: thats what im saying I thought I did have basic programming nowledge
 eulerscheZahl: video is baguette, yes
 Julian_Dixon: so how does one gain this basic programming knowledge?
 Scarfield: Julian_Dixon you kinda need to know the basics at this site, the easy puzzles can be used to get an idea of what to learn about. They are tagged with what you need to know about to solve
 jacek: Julian_Dixon <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a> easy ones include: the descent, power of thor, temperatures, dual horse racing
 HookUpz: @Julian the easy category here is just not 'easy' at all. on half the excercices u get barely any explanation and ur supposed to do all kinds of stuff.
 Scarfield: tutorials, or another site unfortunately, when you know the basics, its a great site&#160;:)

 Astrobytes: ^
 Julian_Dixon: ok i guess ill try that
 eulerscheZahl: later ones will be private, wood is just dumb introduction
 JackMc: If you're a physics guy try doing some of the project euler problems maybe
 MSmits: thanks for making me feel dumb euler :P
 eulerscheZahl: you're welcome
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: :P
 StevenV: well, I know there was a bot ...
 StevenV: if only I know
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: if i have time to code
 StevenV: haha
 DomiKo: there is a bug in statement in bronze league: "Line 1: gamePhase the name of the current game phase. It can be MOVE, RELEASE"
 eulerscheZahl: meh

 ToshiTuringMachine: seems a bug
 eulerscheZahl: when did you move to the netherlands?
 ToshiTuringMachine: hey eulerscheZahl, now it's been 2.5 yrs
 eulerscheZahl: infinite loop is reported on the forum already
 MSmits: hi neighbor
 eulerscheZahl: do you speak some dutch already?
 ToshiTuringMachine: not very much
 eulerscheZahl: can you communicate with smits in his native language?
 eulerscheZahl: for Germans this language sounds so weird
 Scarfield: lel
 ToshiTuringMachine: what are smits
 eulerscheZahl: like a mix of German and English
 Astrobytes: for everyone Dutch sounds weird :P
 JayyKeyy: I bet it's hard to learn dutch when English is always an option since all dutch people speak english
 MSmits: as long as you dont say lul Scarfield
 Astrobytes: haha
 ToshiTuringMachine: yes here in NL 99.99% of people speak fluent english
 Scarfield: thats what it was xD
 eulerscheZahl: go to Fr for the next level
 Astrobytes: if you think Dutch is weird, try Afrikaans
 MSmits: well, not all. But the higher educated ones all do
 MSmits: Afrikaans is weird to Dutch 
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what that sounds like
 MSmits: it sounds like Dutch only different
 MSmits: like German sounds like Dutch only different. 
 Astrobytes: It's a mixture of so much, it has Zulu influences in there too
 eulerscheZahl: like Switzerdütsch
 ToshiTuringMachine: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/KZlp-croVYw?t=87">https://youtu.be/KZlp-croVYw?t=87</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of clicking noises
 Astrobytes: hehe, that's some language
 Astrobytes: Yeah euler, they all have meaning
 MSmits: yeah if a hyper-intelligent insect race ever lands on Earth they will land in Africa
 Scarfield: beatboxing
 MSmits: this is how insects talk in sci-fi. 
 ToshiTuringMachine: i invited my collegues to join the contest but they ignored me
 ToshiTuringMachine:&#160;:(
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 ToshiTuringMachine: not real coding lovers
 Astrobytes: get new colleagues
 Illedan: I gave up my collegues for contests
 MSmits: same
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have coders among my colleagues
 MSmits: well only like 3 of them can code anyways
 JayyKeyy: *gasp*
 eulerscheZahl: bunch of CAD designers
 Scarfield: hey now
 aCat: this cat remains silent :P
 Astrobytes: I asked some of my coder friends and they took one look and said "I can't do that"
 MSmits: did they design acat?
 eulerscheZahl: no you aren't, i talked to you just a week ago or so
 Illedan: aCat, you should stop talking and enter bronze :P
 aCat: I know&#160;:(
 aCat: but its hard
 MSmits: Illedan how? I am looking for simple heuristic rules to get there
 Illedan: -.-
 MSmits: wood 1 now 
 aCat: python oneliners dont work
 MSmits: i am avoiding desks with opponent near
 ToshiTuringMachine: ARCHITECTURE_STUDY after score 4
 aCat: and I dont want to switch to true coding until bronze ;p
 ToshiTuringMachine: so easy

 Illedan: I wish I had a tooltip in the viewer for my whole deck&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: do you always print the first valid action struct?

 Scarfield: 13 wins / 3 losses so far with that
 VizGhar: Those images in game description are useles without captions :D I've had to stare at them for like 5 minutes each to understand what they mean
 VizGhar: But I somehow like the design of game
 struct: graphics are good

 Illedan: xD
 VizGhar: UI good UX not that much

 ToshiTuringMachine: that infinite loop bug is terriblefirst time I see such a FAIL in a contest
 Illedan: Upvote it on the forum
 MSmits: what is the bug?
 Reorso: i played patchwork some times!
 ToshiTuringMachine: if you play_card random but have only bonus and technical debt, it will ask again to play_card
 MSmits: ohh ok so it's a real bug
 ToshiTuringMachine: please forum link Illedan?

 ToshiTuringMachine: oh that's a different bug
 Nerchio: turn 9-10 someone understands?
 Nerchio: frames*
 MSmits: whats weird about it?
 Illedan: I'll check Nerchio
 Nerchio: you need to throw away 2 cards MSmits
 MSmits: ohh
 Nerchio: and feels like I lose only 1
 MSmits: it does look that way
 Illedan: Maybe you pickup 1 of the ones you are about to throw? So that the game doesn't remove it?
 Nerchio: i dont know where I would get it from though
 MSmits: yay bronze
 struct: grats
 MSmits: i did the architecture thing
 MSmits: "You can now play all 8 skill cards."
 MSmits: I could not before&#160;??
 Illedan: No
 MSmits: oh for the play card phase
 struct: oh the skills are based on cards
 struct: I didnt even notice it
 struct: thanks MSmits
 MSmits: yw
 MSmits: infinite training?
 MSmits: is this one of the bugs?
 Illedan: ye
 ToshiTuringMachine: yes
 struct: Can someone explain how infinite training works?
 jacek: you train for infinite time
 jacek: [solved]
 Illedan: ^^
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct:&#160;:/
 MSmits: you can play a new card if you train
 MSmits: if that card is a training card, you can play it again
 VizGhar: sounds like comment of junior developer
 MSmits: =)
 struct: so I need 2 training cards in hand for it to work?
 ToshiTuringMachine: that action should at least throw the Trainng card away so it cannot train again
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Seems once you have 1 Training Or Coding, you can just get all cards at hand
 MSmits: wait, your card doesn't discard when you play it?
 struct: So I only need 1 training card for loop?
 MSmits: is there any disadvantage to playing a card?
 struct: I dont understand sorry
 Illedan: I'm still confused
 jacek: afaik you train when you have no cards and it loops&#160;:?
 ToshiTuringMachine: if you have empty drawing pile and try to train, it will do nothing and ask to do one more play_card action 
 struct: ah
 Illedan: Maybe it discards on use, if it really is used
 Illedan: Hard to tell as some stuff is done automatically
 MSmits: no, when you play a card it is discarded
 MSmits: just checked
 MSmits: it's just a bug for training as ToshiTuringMachine described
 struct: yeah I just tried it too
 struct: it just seems to loop if the draw pile is empty?
 struct: or maybe if it has &lt; 2?
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: REFACTORING (7). The team can remove a Technical Debt card from their hand and put it back on the board.
 MSmits: does that mean it goes on a desk?
 struct: I think it goes to mid pile
 MSmits: what's that pile used for?
 struct: So I guess its just removed
 struct: Nothing
 MSmits: mmh ok
 struct: Im not sure though
 MSmits:  "on the board" is a bit vague
 diek: hi, im stuck on wood 2, the rng seems to have a lot of weight on my rank, any advice?
 MSmits: lose some weight?
 diek: xD
 MSmits: didn't mean to be rng-shaming though
 MSmits: but if your bot gets better, the rng will not be able to weigh you down
 MSmits: you can do several things
 diek: please continue
 MSmits: most importantly is probably to release the application for which you lack the least skills
 MSmits: so you dont get so much technical debt 
 MSmits: also don't always release. Maybe only release when you lack a certain amount 
 MSmits: not sure what the sweet spot is
 diek: mmm i don't get that, how it's related the release with the tech debt? i think it does not apply in this level
 MSmits: it does, when you get tech debt, you get tech debt cards
 diek: ah
 MSmits: and those cards fill up your hand with nothing to show for it
 diek: so my deck is full of crap too
 diek: okok
 MSmits: yeah crap deck
 diek: ty
 diek: i can continue from here
 MSmits: allright then&#160;:)
 MSmits: also there is some luck required. If you win almost always vs boss and your submission doesnt end at the top, waiting a while may help
 MSmits: other people will submit and fight your bot
 MSmits: in the meantime you can just keep coding ofc
 diek: yeah, let see
 diek: ty
 MSmits: mmh I think it would have been better to end the game on X turns instead of on 200 game phases
 MSmits: now the max number of turns depends on how many times a give_card or play_card phase appeared
 MSmits: or throw_card
 MSmits: but perhaps with better bots, it will never go over 200
 MSmits: in that case it's fine
 Illedan: If they fix the bugs it will never go to 200
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: I see 2 ways opponent can influence you: Finish an app or occupy a desk you wanted to go near
 MSmits: am i missing something?
 Illedan: He can hold skill cards you want
 MSmits: how?
 Illedan: There is only 5 of each type
 Illedan: You get them while moving
 MSmits: oh I see. a desk can get empty
 Illedan: Yeah, then you get bonus instead
 MSmits: which is worse isnt it?
 Illedan: Not sure
 Illedan: Use CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION on a BONUS and it stacks up very nice
 Snef: Illedan do you get a bug where you time out using TASK_PRIORITIZATION&#160;?
 MSmits: right
 Crosility: Any mods able to help with a quest-map problem/bug?
 MSmits: mods dont fix bugs
 Illedan: Snef, not sure. Don't use that skill actively. Maybe my RANDOM action uses it
 MSmits: they fix spammers/trolls
 Snef: Snef provided incorrect input. you do not have a card of type CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION to deprioritize
 Snef: i used RANDOM :D
 Illedan: ^^
 Snef: and i do have a CONTINUOUS card
 Illedan: In hand?
 Snef: yes
 Snef: but opp gave it to me last turn maybe it's a bug
 Crosility: Thanks MSmits, guess look for a support/contact us link. :P Not that is matters, really would like to continue this branch :P
 MSmits: you need a dev, or a tech support message on the forum, or maybe just explain the problem here and someone will know
 VizGhar: If there is "team draws cards" it means from draw pile only I assume
 VizGhar: Reading through "Use a skill" section
 MSmits: guess so yeah
 VizGhar: And "can play 2 more cards" means I can use skill 2 more times?
 Crosility: I'm soft locked out of completing AI-node 4 on the quest-map. "Register to a contest". I pre-registered, and it didn't meet the criteria. And seeing as live-contests are.. semi? annual from the looks of it. It could be a long time to fill that requirement.
 MSmits: 2 more play card phases
 MSmits: you can registef immediately after this one
 VizGhar: PLAY_CARD = "use a skill"
 MSmits: register
 MSmits: usually they come up
 MSmits: yeah viz
 VizGhar: those rules :D even totoro was easier to understand
 struct: already optimizing MSmits?
 MSmits: much
 MSmits: no
 jacek: bitboards or delete
 struct: oh I saw register keyword
 MSmits: i am thinking about a search
 Crosility: Okay, thanks MSmits. I do hope that allows me to continue the AI path. :D
 MSmits: i hope so too, they changed some stuff with events and such lately, maybe the path is bugged now
 MSmits: getting help with non-contest stuff during a contest is a bit difficult i think though
 VizGhar: with those play card actions even heuristics seems pretty good tho... but i'm scared of the if-else branching
 Crosility: Probably, bet they are completely tied to keeping servers up-with All the bots scanning data super fast, just to output "Random". :P
 MSmits: well if all they are doing is input and random its not so bad
 MSmits: imagine if they use the full calc time
 MSmits: Response time per turn ≤ 50ms (Doing Green IT means sparing resources)
 MSmits: it's like they are asking us, please dont use the full calc time, think of the environment
 Crosility: 50 ms is a long time - that's 20 FPS efficiency. - if you were outputting display and all.I'm surprised they give more than ~10ms.
 MSmits: some languages use a lot of time
 jacek: like french
 Crosility: :joy:
 VizGhar: Why there is no France flag in emojis? (the white one)
 VizGhar: *french
 struct: :flag_white:
 VizGhar: oh
 VizGhar: &gt; After moving, the team can get their new skill card from a desk one step away. If you play many cards, their effects will add up.
 [SG]Sebastien: we wanted to reduce the time limit (20 or 30ms). But it crashed the referee (minimum time for one turn is 50ms)
 MSmits: VizGhar yeah seems so
 pedrosorio: meanwhile, my python bot takes 40ms to read the input (I must be logging the wrong thing, surely xD)
 VizGhar: and I loose both "permanent skills" upon releasing application?
 struct: you need to start the timer after reading first input
 pedrosorio: struct &lt;3
 VizGhar: (or don't start it at all)
 VizGhar: will you use search? if not, then ignore time constraints. I doubt you can overdo it
 MSmits: VizGhar thanks for reminding me about the permancy of the cards, not permanent at all
 pedrosorio: are we to assume our bot is always the first player in the input?
 jacek: exile target permament. oops its not permanent
 jacek: yes
 Illedan: yes pedrosorio
 Illedan: Nerchio beating me some&#160;:(
 VizGhar: How would you call it instead of permanent?&#160;:) long effect?
 MSmits: he does that
 MSmits: how about temporary
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 Nerchio: Illedan yeah I think i have positive win ratio but my bot is garbage :joy:
 Illedan: notPermanent
 MSmits: your bot is shoddy
 MSmits: gotta stay with the lingo
 Nerchio: lel
 Illedan: I should screenshot some of my bot for you
 VizGhar: is that even real word? :D
 Illedan: damn it is crap
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: dunno, i know sheddy, but not shoddy
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641600679">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641600679</a>
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: This new logic worked
 Illedan: xD
 MSmits: sheddy = "was made in a shed"
 Illedan: gratz on bronze aCat
 Nerchio: you are p1 in that game gg Illedan
 Nerchio: :D
 Illedan: ^^
 Illedan: You steal my first move plan :O
 Illedan: Now I need to check if you are at 5&#160;:(
 Nerchio: yeah tbh 5 is op i dont do anything else
 Illedan: yup
 Nerchio: i mean i didnt bother reading other actions
 aCat: thank you Illedan&#160;:-)
 aCat: much more code than I would like
 Illedan: Refactoring is better :P
 Illedan: I got 230 lines of IF forrest&#160;:/
 struct: oh no
 aCat: now, time to run c#, and python to bin&#160;;]
 MSmits: run IF forrest, run
 pedrosorio: struct definitely something fishy going on with the time.
 jacek: its not environment friendly
 pedrosorio: alternatively: I'm just dumb and running an infinite loop :P
 VizGhar: Is there any reason to play 6ths action?
 Illedan: CODE_REVIEW?
 VizGhar: +
 Illedan: Ofc
 VizGhar: better odds only?
 Illedan: You get more cards
 Illedan: that you can throw away from 7-0
 Illedan: Without wasting a move
 MSmits: throw away from 7-0?
 MSmits: what does that mean?
 MSmits: oh the mandatory throwaway
 Illedan: Going past the admin desk
 VizGhar: wait... arent you throwing only skill cards there?
 jacek: as in real life, no point in CODE_REVIEW
 Illedan: BONUS is a skill card
 VizGhar: oh... that's something new thanks :D
 MSmits: yeah, there's no way to know that
 MSmits: that bonus cards are skills
 Illedan: I figured it out by reading what the RANDOM action I did xD
 MSmits: continuous integration is the only real permanent skill?/
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: that is the best
 MSmits: do you get this in input?
 Illedan: Get what?
 Illedan: That it is the best?
 Nerchio: you get it
 MSmits: the fact that it's permanent
 Nerchio: in AUTOMATED
 Nerchio: "Location can be HAND, DRAW, DISCARD , AUTOMATED, OPPONENT_CARDS"
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Illedan: Do you see enemy automated?
 Nerchio: i dont think so
 Nerchio: but idk
 Illedan: hmm
 MSmits: thats weird, it's a pile though
 Nerchio: maybe its hidden in opponent_cards
 Illedan: yeah
 struct: ill try on C++ pedrosorio since i dont really know python
 Illedan: So you can keep count
 VizGhar: OPPONENT_AUTOMATED will appear in later leagues
 MSmits: can you see how many cards are in a desk?&gt;
 VizGhar: hmm?
 Illedan: desk?
 MSmits: one of the 8 desks
 Illedan: You have to count
 Illedan: All decks
 Illedan: *Card lists
 Illedan: You get as input
 VizGhar: desk, deck, board... who knows&#160;:)
 MSmits: but you dont know what the opponent has right?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c561672-14ab-4e8e-be5d-d726254c279e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c561672-14ab-4e8e-be5d-d726254c279e</a>
 VizGhar: Not easy to explain the game
 Illedan: Ok I got OPP_AUTO
 MSmits: wait, you get his hand too&#160;??
 Illedan: No
 Illedan: Only his total cards
 MSmits: OPPONENT_CARDS 1 1 0 1 1 2 2 1 9 11
 MSmits: what is this?
 Illedan: That is his whole deck
 MSmits: ohhh
 Illedan: Draw + discard + hand
 MSmits: minus automated
 struct: pedrosorio I dont get timeouts in c++ maybe its only on python
 MSmits: those in separate pile i guess
 MSmits: what a weird game
 MSmits: I don't dislike it, but... weird
 VizGhar: understandable... same here
 Nerchio: well p1 advantage will be big
 MSmits: there seems to be only 1 advantage really
 MSmits: the first desk he moves to will block others
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: You can even get input where you have no hand
 Illedan: -.-
 MSmits: why is that bad?
 Illedan: It crashes my program
 MSmits: why?
 Illedan: I expect to have a hand :P
 MSmits: ah, I don't have that issue
 MSmits: my bot has low expectations
 struct: my bot doesnt even need inputs
 MSmits: sounds advanced
 MSmits: it already knows right?
 VizGhar: the graphics is really cute... just open the game, pause it and enjoy it :D
 RSBat: print("RANDOM") needs no inputs too
 MSmits: it seems the task prioritization team is working on a 4p game
 struct: pedrosorio its working for me
 struct: I was measuring 400ms instead of 40ms
 MSmits: ohh, already doing search eh&gt;?
 struct: no
 struct: I dont even have any code yet
 MSmits: o
 struct: He was just having problems measuring time
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: used cards go back to the desks?
 pedrosorio: struct you mean measuring after the first input line, or before?
 DomiKo: we don't need search, we just have to copy META
 struct: after
 MSmits: mmh seems like all cards go into discard?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6b0fe5f6-29b2-4993-96a6-05b8c018a223">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6b0fe5f6-29b2-4993-96a6-05b8c018a223</a>
 struct: I think this is correct pedrosorio
 Illedan: Oh, thx
 Illedan: I'll use that
 struct: I will only copy meta if I dont reach legend
 Illedan: Hard to copy meta here I think
 struct: I refuse to face the pain I faced the last contest
 MSmits: there's 1 thing better than copying meta
 Illedan: Because it is impossible to read a replay from the viewer
 MSmits: that's countering meta
 Illedan: I'm countering Nerchio's IFs at the moment
 MSmits: nice
 Nerchio: I'm countering Illedan IFs at the moment
 struct: is this a if game?
 MSmits: doesn't have to be
 MSmits: you can use switch
 struct: im already training my NN
 Illedan: I think you can do &gt; 50% of the actions by IF
 VizGhar: what happens if you play REFACTORING and have no technical debt on hand?&#160;:)
 Illedan: You lose 1 action
 MSmits: or you find a new bug
 VizGhar: sounds cool... well... this will be another if-else challenge i suppose. Or throwing as much guess-what-happen simulations as possible
 VizGhar: wonder if somebody will come up with NN :P
 MSmits: the hard part is dealing with all those app recipes
 MSmits: that's a lot of possible inputs
 VizGhar: and why is there progressbar for technical debt?
 MSmits: it's a win condition thing
 MSmits: if you get app 5 on same turn, you need that bar to be short
 VizGhar: ok... but it looks like it is capped to 20
 MSmits: are you saying the referee cannot accomodate your bots shoddiness?
 struct: "36 BONUS skill and 100 Technical Debt cards available on the board."
 struct: maybe this is important MSmits
 struct: since you asked where the cards go
 MSmits: the cards all seem to go into discard
 Nerchio: Illedan xd
 MSmits: when you release an app
 DomiKo: if else battle!
 struct: I mean on refactoring
 MSmits: oh yeah it goes back among the 100
 MSmits: TASK_PRIORITIZATION (3). The team will remove one skill card from their hand and put it back on the board.They will then take another available skill card from the board.
 MSmits: this one also seems to give card back to their desks
 MSmits: as opposed to the discard pile
 Illedan: hm Nerchio?
 MACKEYTH: Are desks 0 and 7 next to each other for GIVE purposes?
 MSmits: yeah also daily routine
 MSmits: and there is that admin office
 Nerchio: :rage:
 Illedan: ^^
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Nerchio: hm Illedan?
 Illedan: Buggy IF
 MSmits: this has never happened before. Euler in bed on first day of contest and i rank 1 above him&#160;:)
 MSmits: he's usually beating me hard in the first days at least. But I guess there is tomorrow&#160;:)
 VizGhar: euler -&gt; :poop: smits :crown:
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I don't want to get into the if-forest business
 MSmits: Gonna try to come up with a search before i improve bot further
 VizGhar: smitsy smitsy, why so stubborn?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 VizGhar: its green event... forests are more than welcome
 MSmits: i guess that makes sense
 VizGhar: and dont forget:&gt; Response time per turn ≤ 50ms (Doing Green IT means sparing resources)
 struct: Are skills points based on current cards on hand?
 struct: For the App release
 MSmits: + automated
 VizGhar: :point_up:
 struct: thanks
 Illedan: :tada: new IF incomming Nerchio
 Nerchio: :scream:
 Illedan: We draw on techinal depth when you are first :D
 VizGhar: and then blaster will come with another super idea and everybody will copy him
 Illedan: I need blaster to put out his ideas before I get bored
 Nerchio: i run out of ideas already
 Nerchio: ran*
 Illedan: That last win I had was close :D
 Illedan: 5 to 4 tech depth
 MSmits: ohhh, damn you keep confusing me with your depth lol
 MSmits: now i get it
 MSmits: deBt
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: auto typeing
 pedrosorio: the depth of the tech skills
 MSmits: i honestly thought you were talking about something else
 Illedan: ah, I wrote it wrong every time
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: DEBT
 MSmits: this game is weird enough to make me doubt myself about everything
 pedrosorio: wood 2 -&gt; wood 1, let's go
 pedrosorio: typical question: how long do I have to wait after battles in progress are done, to get the promotion?
 MSmits: not long
 MSmits: waiting for them to be done can be long though
 struct: pedrosorio did you see the code?
 MSmits: last contest it could take half a day sometimes
 Illedan: Zylo moving to 5 first now too&#160;:(
 Nerchio: before this submit
 Nerchio: there was almost 100% win ratio for p1
 pedrosorio: struct yeah, I did, that's what I was doing, I just had an infinite loop in there&#160;:) thanks!
 struct: np
 FrankR: what happens if you play REFACTORING but have no technical debt cards in hand?
 aCat: is it legal action then?
 Illedan: Legal
 Illedan: And wastes the action
 FrankR: so it just discards the REFACTORING?
 Illedan: ye
 FrankR: ok. thanks
 struct: Time to start coding for me
 MSmits: "Applications will get bigger through the leagues.
 MSmits: are all applications within a league the same size?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: Was smaller in woods
 MSmits: are they 4/4 in bronze?
 Illedan: ye
 MSmits: so no 2/2/2&#160;?
 Illedan: Ah, shit. Reached limit of plays
 Illedan: -.-
 struct: already?
 Illedan: Test by submit it is
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I spammed IF checks
 Nerchio: bug Illedan? 
 Illedan: How would I know
 Illedan: Can't test locally
 pedrosorio: rules clearly missing some detail
 pedrosorio: on wood 1 they describe the "GIVE" action which is "mandatory and is only available in the GIVE_CARD phase"
 pedrosorio: but there is no such phase in the turn description (instead it's mentioned in passing under the "Move" phase)
 MSmits: you're right, it's a lot of trial and error to figure out some rules
 pedrosorio: I deduce from the description that you'll get a GIVE_CARD phase immediately after the move phase if you disturb the opponent (abs(move - opponent_location) &lt;= 1?)
 VizGhar: what doesCONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION 8do?
 MSmits: yes pedrosorio
 struct: There is GIVE_CARD
 _Lupus_: Why am I disqualified for attempting to release a 2/2/2 application with 3 bonus cards (accepting 3 technical debt) in the green circle challenge? Am I reading the rules wrong?
 Illedan: Maybe I should start to consider what locations to visit depending on the Applications left :thinking:
 struct: and THROW_CARD
 struct: and  more
 Karang: eulerscheZahl you are still there&#160;?
 pedrosorio: unless you have 0 skill cards in hand, in which case they will hand you 2 tech debt cards at the end of move phase?
 Illedan: He sleeps
 Karang: damn
 Illedan: _Lupus_ do you have the 3 cards at hand?
 Karang: ok
 MSmits: also, is this your 5th application _Lupus_?
 struct: you will get 2 tech yeah
 struct: but from the board itself
 struct: I think
 pedrosorio: struct THROW_CARD lol, that's only in bronze I guess?
 struct: yes
 _Lupus_: It's not my fifth application and I have the cards at hand. Replay is here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641618967">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/641618967</a>
 Illedan: Can't see applications in replays&#160;:(
 MSmits: apps disappear when they are finished
 _Lupus_: ohhhh, I read it from the initial input
 MSmits: ahh that explains it then
 MSmits: there is no "initial input" in this game
 MSmits: it's just the full gamestate each turn
 _Lupus_: But its only turn 2 or so. The opponent has not released it
 MSmits: i'd say fix the bug and try again
 MSmits: maybe there is some other reason that will disappear when you fix your input thingyu
 _Lupus_: Thanks
 pedrosorio: a funny inconsistency in the move phase description: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c710cdce-87be-4d15-80a4-4aa38a07b9bc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c710cdce-87be-4d15-80a4-4aa38a07b9bc</a>
 Illedan: The skill you get is added to your draw pile and not your hand
 Illedan: Not 100% sure to pick it up
 MSmits: really? I thought it was going to your hand?
 Illedan: Oh
 Illedan: hmm
 struct: There is a limit of bonus cards
 Illedan: seems so
 struct: 40
 pedrosorio: struct O_O
 struct: 36*
 struct: The game starts with 5 skill cards on each desk, 36 BONUS skill and 100 Technical Debt cards available on the board.
 MSmits: jeez you are like nr 1 for hours Illedan and we are still stuck on simple things like this.... this game lol
 Mr.empty: i've faced a tricky situation where my code passe all tests successfully but when i submit it gets some errors with validator 4 and 3 .
 Mr.empty: could someone help&#160;?
 pedrosorio: struct is that in the bronze rules or did you reverse engineer the thing?
 struct: its in bronze I guess
 struct: Mr.empty which puzzle?
 MSmits: so you can get 2 technical debt in a very very rare instance where a desk is empty and all bonus cards are gone and you disturb your opponent?
 struct: I guess
 struct: its what I understand from the rules
 struct: if the code does that I have no clue
 pedrosorio: struct lol
 XeroOl: should I join the contest?
 struct: why shouldnt you?
 MSmits: yes you should XeroOl, we will have another chance at someone able to properly explain to us the rules
 j4at: I went to sleep and I woke up and you still guys don't understand the rules :3
 XeroOl: idk, I guess I'll do it
 j4at: scuffed event
 j4at: jk
 MSmits: it's a journey of discovery j4at
 XeroOl: I now have to pick a language, the hardest part of codingame
 MSmits: yes, should you go with scala...  or dart?
 j4at: bash
 XeroOl: I think of the two, I'll pick scala
 XeroOl: lets do scala then
 struct: I would choose a language with avx support for this contest
 struct: 8 is a perfect number
 XeroOl: oh is this one of those
 Westicles: I got 1st in groovy last contest
 MSmits: no lol
 MSmits: it's not
 XeroOl: is this one of those challenges where assembly intrinsics will be helpful
 XeroOl: I guess I should read the rules
 MSmits: no it's really not
 struct: :rolling_eyes:
 XeroOl: reading is hard
 MSmits: ^
 MSmits: this applies very nicely to this contest
 struct: If I get 1st in C++ it means I won the contest
 MSmits: not necessarily
 MSmits: top 3 is all non-c++ now&#160;:)
 KNTK: Reading is very hard
 MSmits: only 1 c++ in top 10
 struct: thats normal
 XeroOl: unless some crazy rust person spends half their time working on the contest and the other half of their time compiling&#160;:)
 Westicles: no starter for c++
 MSmits: starter seems pretty useless here
 XeroOl: you don't need a starter I don't think
 MSmits: i mean you got Random
 MSmits: what does the starter do?
 XeroOl: I can see why y'all are complaining about the rules lol
 Westicles: it says if you change a few lines you can get to bronze
 MSmits: yes
 KNTK: Is the green circle a single player game on Wood 2?
 MSmits: basically
 KNTK: Yeah it seems to be like darts, if my opponent does well then I'll take more risks etc.
 XeroOl: from what I can tell, for wood 2 the only interaction is that you could snipe the opponent's apps, and something about moving desks that isn't well explained
 MSmits: you can't move the desks
 XeroOl: desks have 5 skill cards on them and there is no way to access them?
 XeroOl: it explicitly says you must move desks
 MSmits: no, they are too heavy
 XeroOl: "The team begins by moving to another desk (they must leave the desk for the other team)."
 MSmits: oh you mean move from the desks
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but you must leave the desks where they are
 XeroOl: although there's nothing in the rules right now about why I would care at all about desks
 MSmits: you get a card when you arrive at a desk
 MSmits: and the card is used to complete apps
 Geras: "Geras has not provided an action in time" while there is an output. After looking reaaaaally hard I found the culprit: print instead of println. Great.
 KNTK: Also what does it mean that you have to move forward? Can't I move from Coding 8 steps and land on Training?
 XeroOl: ahh I see
 MSmits: yes KNTK but in bronze you incur a penalty
 KNTK: Thanks
 MSmits: for crossing the admin desk
 MSmits: allright i am getting some sleep GN!

 Astrobytes: I've spent most of my time cooking unfortunately&#160;:(
 j4at: The only way to understand the event is to read the source code
 struct: Im still hoping jacek will bring NN for this contest
 VizGhar: I hope he will bring it 1 day after :P
 pedrosorio: is it possible to run out of cards to draw (by giving cards / returning tech debt cards to the board with refactoring)?
 jacek: i still dont know whats going on there
 j4at: I will use NN :p But i'm not on Jacek level
 struct: pedrosorio maybe yes but in theory probably no
 Illedan: bug Nerchio?
 struct: If I have a a bug I'll probably just blame the referee
 Nerchio: Illedan just p2 things but you have time out :D
 Illedan: :O
 Illedan: :panic:
 Nerchio: you must have cracked the randomess because you get p1 all the time
 xMizar: Can somebody explain me the difference between game phase please? I always receive MOVE in closing stages
 SlurpasGasskagg: is anyone else having issues with the "DISCARD" and "DRAW" getting messed up when the "DRAW" gets emtied?
 SlurpasGasskagg: *emptied
 SlurpasGasskagg: (seems like cards are in both card_location_counts when it wraps)
 SlurpasGasskagg: my bad, found it!
 ilgiocatore: xMizar you automatically skip phases if you don't have possible moves

 pedrosorio: the REFACTORING action doesn't do what I would expect
 pedrosorio: move 56-&gt;57
 FrankR: Rule question: I have 1 architecture study in my hand, 2 in my discard and my opponent has 2 in his draw.Why is it a possible action to do a task prioritization and change a bonus skill card against a 6th architecture study?
 cegprakash: how do I know how much skill my team has learned? anyone has an idea I always see 0 on the UI
 ilgiocatore: pedrosorio it seems you just skipped release phase because you didn't have any possible moves and discarded your cards at the end of your turn
 pedrosorio: ilgiocatore thank you, that makes perfect sense
 pedrosorio: lovely bug when playing TRAINING with no cards in draw/discard pile:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641649638">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641649638</a>
 jacek: its known
 cegprakash: cegprakash has in hand: BONUS (8), BONUS (8), BONUS (8), TECHNICAL_DEBT (9)
 cegprakash: can someone explain what this means in the start of the game
 cegprakash: do I have 3 bonus cards or 3x8=24 bonus cards
 PiterYeh: 8 is just the ID for the BONUS type
 PiterYeh: 9 is the ID for debit, and so on
 cegprakash: thx PiterYeh
 PiterYeh: welcome&#160;:)
 cegprakash: in that case in statement it's given each team starts the game with 4 BONUS skill cards and 4 Technical Debt cards.

 cegprakash: I am starting with 4 cards in my draw pile in first turn in wood 2
 cegprakash: at 0th turn
 cegprakash: nvm
 cegprakash: I understood ur statement now
 cegprakash: when do cards go to discard pile
 cegprakash: lot of my cards go to discard pile
 struct: at the end of the turn
 struct: or when you use skills I think
 cegprakash: I'm in wood 2 and I have no skills
 cegprakash: I just move and release
 cegprakash: still lot of cards are getting discarded
 struct: ok so at the end of the turn
 cegprakash: I see
 cegprakash: so releasing an application discards cards?
 struct: and then when your draw pile is empty all your cards in discard will move to the draw pilke
 struct: pile*

 struct: well you need 2 on 2nd 2 on 5th and 2 on 7th
 struct: unless you have bonus cards then they count as 1 of any type
 wlesavo: i have 2 cards for skills and 2 shady, this should be enough isnt it?
 struct: ah wait
 struct: you have 2 bonus cards?
 struct: in hand?
 wlesavo: no, only skills
 wlesavo: but shoddy comes from skills as well
 wlesavo: as i understood
 wlesavo: i feel dumb
 struct: yeah but they give 2 for the specific skills
 struct: you are missing on the 7th 1 specific skill card
 wlesavo: Each specific skill card provides 2 good skills (of this specific type) and 2 shoddy skills.
 struct: oh
 wlesavo: oh, so there is different kinds of shoddy then?
 struct: no
 struct: im wrong
 struct: yeah I dont understand then why you can release
 wlesavo: no i think you right, soddy from skills provide the same skill points
 wlesavo: that explains it
 struct: its a bit confusing
 struct: now I dont understand it myself
 struct: I dont understand how I could release this
 struct: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 4
 struct: HAND 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6
 DomiKo: 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 &gt; 4 + 4 
 DomiKo: each skill card give you 4points
 DomiKo: 2good+ 2 bad
 DomiKo: then each bonus give you 1good and 1 bad point
 DomiKo: so from that hand you can make 16 points
 struct: oh
 struct: and then I have automated skills
 struct: The 6 are trash cards
 j4at: My computer crashed because out of memory while training&#160;:/ I lost my  green circle code&#160;:-(
 struct: training?
 DomiKo: why you do this?
 j4at: yeah im almost done
 struct: I dont understand this then DomiKo

 struct: Now Im the one feeling dumb lol
 j4at: jk, its search race
 struct: how can 2nd image be 4x 4x
 struct: but first is only 2x 2x 2x
 DomiKo: what?
 DomiKo: from each you can get 12 points
 DomiKo: 6 good and 6 bad
 regismeysso22: what is th etips to level up in green circle
 struct: oh so thats the meaning of the  tech cards in the image
 struct: thanks
 raxkin: Yeah, so you can use the good parts and the bad parts at the same time from 1 card
 DomiKo: so firstly you use all good points, and then use bad points
 struct: yeah I think I got it now
 struct: Thank you
 DomiKo: no problem
 cegprakash: why we are not having deck information in input and making wood 2 so hard
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 struct: you have
 cegprakash: where
 struct: for (int i = 0; i &lt; card_locations_count; i++)
 cegprakash: oh I see
 cegprakash: I don't know why I added tracking
 cegprakash: damn blind me
 cegprakash: that's what happens at 5AM
 cegprakash: I'll code tomorrow
 cegprakash: good night ppl
 cegprakash: I mean good morning to asians :P
 struct: gn
 MACKEYTH: I have no idea what daily routine does.
 BrunoFelthes: any tips to pass wood2?
 DomiKo: first legal move
 struct: or dont use more than 1 Shoddy per application
 struct: after 9 hours im starting to understand the rules
 struct: Not bad
 MACKEYTH: Play cards when you know you won't be able to release an app
 MACKEYTH: struct, can you explain how playing daily routine works?
 struct: when you move you can collect a skill from a table further away
 struct: either to the left or to the right
 MACKEYTH: How do you do that?
 MACKEYTH: Is it random?
 struct: no
 struct: MOVE zoneId cardTypeToTake
 struct: if you used DAILY_ROUTINE twice
 struct: then you can pick from a office at distance 2
 MACKEYTH: Ah, thanks
 struct: and so on
 struct: so if you have 3 you can pick from any office
 MACKEYTH: :taco: struct
 antiwonto: [auto] MACKEYTH has awarded struct 10 tacos. struct now has 72 taco. MACKEYTH now has 11 taco
 struct: oh not any
 struct: its 8
 struct: but you get the idea :p
 struct: thanks
 MACKEYTH: Card tracking gets a lot more complicated in bronze.
 Westicles: Thanks to whoever pushed me into wood1.  Any hints for a simple way into bronze?
 Westicles: dang, the euros are all asleep, and the americans are too dumb to help :P
 struct: well Westicles I got bronze by just printing the 1st action
 struct: not sure if its enough now
 Westicles: aha, well I'll just wait a few days
 MACKEYTH: :p
 pedrosorio: is it me or are there a suspiciously large number of cats on the bronze leaderboard?
 struct: wdym?
 Westicles: avatars
 struct: ah
 pedrosorio: Does anyone know if THROW actions return the skill cards to the skill desks or do the cards get removed from the game?
 Westicles: It is obvious if you read paragraph 37, subparagraph g, clause 4
 MACKEYTH: AFAIK, cards are never removed from the game
 pedrosorio: Westicles lol
 MACKEYTH: And if I understand the doc correctly, thrown cards go back to the desks or the bonus pile
 pedrosorio: makes sense
 struct: That should be correct yeah
 struct: It should be easy to check how many cards are on each desk
 MACKEYTH: struct, do you know if automated cards count against how many cards you draw?
 struct: I dont think they do
 MACKEYTH: Here's another one for you: are automated cards immune from being thrown?
 struct: I guess so
 struct: I havent tried it tbh
 struct: The card needs to be in hand
 pedrosorio: top50 briefly, screenshotting now (no mention of bronze league of course) :P
 MACKEYTH: Do you get TD for being unable to throw a card, like with giving?
 pedrosorio: MACKEYTH, you need to throw 2 skill cards when passing the admin desk, if you can't you get 1 TD for each failure
 pedrosorio: the details are at the end of the "1. Move" section in turn description (the TD part is after the image)
 MACKEYTH: Yep, there it is right there.
 MACKEYTH: I'm thinking about implementing some move code to mess with +1ers.
 pedrosorio: what are +1ers?
 MACKEYTH: Bots that always move +1 desk
 MACKEYTH: Honestly don't know if that's being used much in bronze, though.
 pedrosorio: I like how new terminology develops around a game that is not even 1 day old :D
 struct: When I go from 7-0
 struct: so administrative task 
 struct: can I choose to wait even if I have cards?
 struct: ok I cant
 MACKEYTH: No, throw_card phase doesn't allow wait
 ToshiTuringMachine: if enemy is 0 and i land at 7 I am close? or there's the admin office in the middle
 MACKEYTH: Yes, 0 and 7 count as close to each other.
 ToshiTuringMachine: so you give a card to enemy
 MACKEYTH: Yep
 ToshiTuringMachine: baad
 ToshiTuringMachine: is there a way to track how many cards are in the desks? starts at 2 then it is mistery
 ToshiTuringMachine: cause we don't know enemy hand
 ToshiTuringMachine: when he passes admin office
 MACKEYTH: You have to total up all the skill cards in each card location and subtract that from 5 for each desk
 ToshiTuringMachine: ahhh that's genius
 ToshiTuringMachine: ty
 MACKEYTH: You don't get the enemy hand specifically, you get enemy hand, draw, and discard combined
 ToshiTuringMachine: also automated must be added i guess
 <b>**MACKEYTH nods</b></p><p><img src="/a/4895133817813" /> ToshiTuringMachine: mmm... what about cards in the central pickup pile
 MACKEYTH: Same. There are 36 bonus cards.
 MACKEYTH: Plus 4 for each player's starting draw deck.
 struct: I wont try to understand the game for now
 struct: Ill just write the sim and hope it plays well
 BrunoFelthes: to hard to write a sim
 struct: Previous contest was harder
 struct: to write a sim at least
 j4at: struct share sim after you finish&#160;;)
 BrunoFelthes: you will write a sim for 1 turn, right?
 j4at: This event is pretty complicated for me to hard code&#160;:/I need to pass wood 1 so I can start working on my NN.
 struct: until my turn is over
 BrunoFelthes: because, the next turn, you will receive new cards...
 struct: Well even on the curent turn I can get new cards
 struct: current*
 BrunoFelthes: yeah, too many random things
 struct: I have an idea though just not sure if it will work
 The_Duck: am I dumb or is there no way to see the app recipes in the GUI?
 struct: there is no way
 The_Duck: lame
 The_Duck: at least we can see all the little people in front of whiteboards and stuff, that's useful
 struct: Maybe some of this stuff will be fixed
 MACKEYTH: I wonder if they're going to do something about the infinite training/coding loop

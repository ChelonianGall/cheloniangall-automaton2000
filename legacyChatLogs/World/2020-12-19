 Vagina1337: very useful info
 Torpesh: Hey... new to the site. Can anyone tell me how to see available achievements for a puzzle?
 struct: on your profile
 struct: or for a specific puzzle just click it
 Torpesh: Ahh, found it. I was trying to find it from the coding page. Had to go back to the details page. Weird though - it said that I didn't get any, but when I went to the details it shows that I got 2/2.
 Torpesh: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday
 IamNick: hey
 struct: If I want to overload copy constructor on c++ and I dont want to copy the last N bits, is it bad if I do memcpy(to, from, sizeof(struct)-N_bits)?
 pb4: struct&#160;: Don't do that
 pb4: memcpy works with full bytes, not bits
 struct: what if the all the bits together = 8 bits?
 struct: This still seems to hacky though I think I will avoid it
 pb4: You can only use "vanilla memcpy" if N_bits is a multiple of 8
 pb4: What kind of data structure do you want to copy-but-not-completely&#160;?
 struct: Thanks, also I have a question about moving range from array
 struct: Imagine I want to copy from400-500 to 0-100
 struct: is memcpy fine?
 struct: I dont want to copy, but just move
 mzbear: as long as the ranges don't overlap
 struct: It was some members on the struct that I didnt need to copy, but I dont think it would matter much, so Ill leave the default copy constructor
 pb4: If it's really an array, it won't make a difference if you're copying or moving
 struct: ok, thanks
 pb4: I'd suggest you try the std::copy algorithm and compare with memcpy
 struct: Arent they the same?
 pb4: Less prone to error, and probably just as fast
 struct: ah ok
 jacek: merry Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's merry now :D
 VizGhar: Hey guys... I'd like to contribute with this multiplayer game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGvY3jsLN1I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGvY3jsLN1I</a>
 eulerscheZahl: looks similar to this game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcyz3dzxcm0&amp;ab_channel=TheRealQueenGames">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcyz3dzxcm0&amp;ab_channel=TheRealQueenGames</a>
 eulerscheZahl: if you know how the SDK works, you can probably do it in 3-4 days
 eulerscheZahl: so sounds like a nice project for the christmas holidays if you don't know the quirks yet
 VizGhar:&#160;:) I've quickly read documentation and looked at 4-5 games on github, so I'll struggle a bit, but at least i know where to start
 struct: most of the stuff is pretty simple
 eulerscheZahl: and chat can help
 VizGhar: sure can... you guys are here non-stop :D
 struct: Cant rest before finishing STc
 eulerscheZahl: can rest now, RAIC going well
 eulerscheZahl: and topcoder has a minesweeper optim contest but i don't feel like competing atm&#160;:(
 VizGhar: I wont feel like that next 2 years&#160;:|
 eulerscheZahl: you have time till May to recover
 jrke: what is RAIC&#160;? russianaicup?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: the 2nd most easy tshirt of the year
 SirMiska: Hello everyone! 
 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: hii
 eulerscheZahl: that hii-guy is still trolling on #fr :D
 struct: Its the same guy
 SirMiska: Could you fill me in?
 eulerscheZahl: just enjoy your stay here, i don't want to turn you off by stories about a troll. they come and go
 eulerscheZahl: but the fun multiplayer games on the platform stay
 SirMiska: I always enjoy my time here!
 derjack: aww
 MSmits: oh noes, the pony is back
 derjack: better do the Y thing with my alt
 MSmits: are you afraid you'll break the leaderboard otherwise?
 derjack: yes, i think im lucky with being 4th
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Teo_Bal: sup
 tudor870: ho
 Teo_Bal: no homo tho
 mihaipriboi: sup bitch
 struct: Keep spamming and you will get kicked
 taxxje: is there not a play again for private games
 struct: There is, you can play private clashes
 taxxje: to re-up though
 taxxje: like go again
 Teo_Bal: i destoryed @mihaipriboi
 mihaipriboi: noooooo
 Teo_Bal: yesirrrr
 Teo_Bal: maria?
 mihaipriboi: MARIAAAAAA
 eulerscheZahl: can't even switch chatrooms for a few minutes
 derjack: w00t? you too submiting?
 Teo_Bal: ((((
 struct: Robo also playing?
 Teo_Bal: mihai ce faci?
 eulerscheZahl: playing where?
 derjack: hmm i get random timeouts
 struct: Yavalath
 MSmits: i am submitting because of robo yes
 MSmits: though not just robo, i also still lose other games, so there's work to do
 MSmits: robo made some changes. His bot is pretty deterministic, but also pretty good, so he tends to hit upon a line of play my bot keeps getting wrong
 struct: You need more time for first turn jacek?
 RoboStac: I don't understand my bot anymore
 MSmits: so i suddenly lose 50% or 100% of my games vs him when he does that
 derjack: he didnt add randomness?
 MSmits: dont know derjack
 MSmits: sometimes randomness isnt enough
 MSmits: if you add too much, the bot becomes bad, if you add too little it's deterministic
 MSmits: sometimes the window size is 0
 RoboStac: theres no randomness added
 jrke: you need a good bot + randomness for a good rank
 MSmits: jrke randomness is mostly just needed to beat someone with an opening book
 MSmits: or someone else deterministic who just happens to use the right moves against you
 RoboStac: I think I've got a bug in the learning somewhere and my scores aren't working well (the mean squared error stabilized at .75 which is huge), but the bot still wins somehow
 MSmits: Yavalath is also a weird game because of the early wins. 1 mistake is enough
 MSmits: might have something to do with it robo
 MSmits: it;s not like oware, where you can keep playing and hope your opponent makes a mistake as well, so you can get some seeds back
 MSmits: maybe a game like that is harder to train?
 RoboStac: maybe, but I'm sure it didn't used to do this
 MSmits: well it did use to be very deterministic
 RoboStac: well, the only reason it isn't now is every position is almost identically stored
 RoboStac: *scored
 MSmits: also right after your last submit, i added 1 move to my book that made my winrate go back from 50% to 80-90%
 MSmits: so dont judge by the leaderboard
 RoboStac: like it thinks I have a 50-80% chance to win at all times
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: on your move?
 RoboStac: for both players
 MSmits: because when it's your turn you do have the advantage
 MSmits: i'd say compare it with your other NN's? or is this one fundamentally different?
 RoboStac: I'm pretty sure it's a bug, I've never seen the eval get stuck at such a large error
 MSmits: hmm ok. Well as for your version of last night, i did not see it blunder
 jrke: lemme go for resubmit for my 5 month old bot in yavalath its just mess
 MSmits: derjack that last game is strange. Your bot should be good at spotting traps that late in the game shouldnt it?
 derjack: unlikely. i was thinking of switching to mcts for late game
 MSmits: usually the game ends early because early traps are hard to spot due to large branching
 derjack: patterns get messy
 MSmits: true
 derjack: oh shit i forgot i commented pragmas to debug
 MSmits: aha so i was right
 MSmits: less sims, less depth
 MSmits: more trapping
 MSmits: the 3 2 start is really popular
 MSmits: there's really no reason to use it, some others are just as good
 derjack: my meta mcts always thinks early 3 2 is better than center
 MSmits: as p1 or as p2
 derjack: as p1 without swap
 MSmits: and ofc, with swap rule, center is useless
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: my meta mcts says 44% win as p1
 MSmits: but it's biased because i;ve been using it to counter players as p2
 MSmits: so ofc i get more wins as p2
 MSmits: i suspect it's pretty balanced
 MSmits: oh, one thing about this. I solved all but 4 moves as a win for p1
 MSmits: so thats 56 losses as p2
 MSmits: that might be why your mcts thinks this
 MSmits: but if you pick one of the 4 leftover moves, you're fine as p2
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/QORgpjT">https://imgur.com/a/QORgpjT</a>
 MSmits: ignore the right side, symmetry
 MSmits: as you can see 2 unsolved moves
 eulerscheZahl: i'm probably wrong here as you wrote in C++ but I sense some Windows Forms there
 MSmits: all my meta mcts are windows forms
 MSmits: i start c++ bots from it
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 MSmits: it's so easy
 MSmits: otherwise i know nothing about coding interfaces, w forms really saved me there
 eulerscheZahl: easy to get started
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: WPF is way more flexible. but not a good idea if you want a quick UI without much learning before
 MSmits: I'll remember that, this is also C#?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. or .net in general
 MSmits: I still like C# a lot. Especially after using C++ a lot. It's just more relaxed somehow
 MSmits: you know you're not gonna do something silly thats gonna cost you hours to debug
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i did silly things in C# too
 MSmits: sure, but you have less opportunity to
 eulerscheZahl: pass list to functioninside function: list = list.OrderBy(...).ToList()
 eulerscheZahl: and use the list outside of the function after that
 eulerscheZahl: of course i created a new list and worked on that, nothing I did had any effect
 MSmits: ah you mean you thought it was unchanged?
 eulerscheZahl: story of my GitC contest code&#160;:(
 MSmits: seems like a typical pass by reference bug?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: i suppose C# is more dangerous for that than C++ is
 eulerscheZahl: so my upgrade behavior was flawed
 MSmits: because you abstract more of the functionality, you dont always realize what its doing
 eulerscheZahl: but totally my own fault of course. i still very much like C#
 MSmits: for tiny programs I use python these days because of work
 MSmits: but this Christmas  vacation i'll be coding yavalath in unity, so plenty of opportunity for C#&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: when i do web requests or parse some files, python is my go-to language too.
 MSmits: I think i'll put a minimax AI in it, just so i dont inadvertently share my real bot 
 eulerscheZahl: in unity :D
 MSmits: yep, it's a study project
 MSmits: i'm supposed to code a roll a ball demo level and a game design document for a different game
 MSmits: but i dont like roll a ball
 MSmits: so i'll code yavalath as a demo and make the document about that also, probably should add a twist to it
 MSmits: astrobytes suggested lavalath with a volcano
 eulerscheZahl: or you do something with planes<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5xX6nRWDko&amp;ab_channel=CodeBullet">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5xX6nRWDko&amp;ab_channel=CodeBullet</a>
 MSmits: lol i thought you meant planes as in flat surfaces
 eulerscheZahl: plains
 eulerscheZahl: wait, plane was correct wasn't it?
 MSmits: mmh no there's also a plane as in mathematical plane
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: plains are also flat though
 MSmits: English is fun :P
 MSmits: its actually not easy to make a plane game in unity
 MSmits: you need to keep the plane at center 0,0,0 and instead move the stuff around it
 MSmits: otherwise you easily hit floating point issues
 MSmits: it uses floats for vectors, not doubles
 MSmits: of course you can fix that, but it sounds too complicated for me for a simple 3 EC project
 MSmits: didnt struct do yavalath in 4 hrs. I am guessing that means i can do it in 40
 struct: no
 struct: I didnt know SDK at that time
 MSmits: oh no that was connect 4 right
 struct: it was 1:30
 MSmits: nice nice
 MSmits: so my point is, i am much slower, but i can still do it fairly quickly :P
 eulerscheZahl: "you need to keep the plane at center 0,0,0 and instead move the stuff around it"reminds me of Futurama
 struct: And you already know the game
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I got the AI, just need to convert it to C#

 Maxim251: This is code where boundarys is folowing his step. The square is making smaller when he is moving to end of map, and in same time is moving with orders of his move. If more he is moving on the map, then more precise of his place I get

 VizGhar: Is there already port for CG game skeleton to Kotlin+Gradle. I just made one (force of habit as an Android Dev :P )
 eulerscheZahl: i doubt that Gradle is possible, you probably have to stick to Maven
 eulerscheZahl: Kotlin:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/csj/code-a-la-mode">https://github.com/csj/code-a-la-mode</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/csj/code-royale">https://github.com/csj/code-royale</a>
 VizGhar: not sure how maven-publish works, but I've already make the skeleton run with gradle
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i didn't read correctly: you made it work?also on upload?
 eulerscheZahl: that is: can you upload your gradle project to CG and still have it working?
 VizGhar: as I said... not sure how maven-publish works... but output from kotlin is still java, so it might work... how do i test it as fast as possible
 eulerscheZahl: CG builds your project on their servers
 VizGhar: havent uploaded anything... gonna try right now
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if they understand gradle
 jacek: gradle+kotlin? kradle?
 eulerscheZahl: grotlin
 VizGhar: kotle
 Astrobytes: grotlin, I like it
 VizGhar: allright... gradle impossible&#160;:)
 VizGhar: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'pom.xml'
 VizGhar: so maven is must :P
 eulerscheZahl: is that the right time for "told you so"?

 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: hello stream
 Wisart: how do you make such a big clash :D
 Astrobytes: there's already a notification in clash, on discord and at the top of the site msd9126 - was that necessary to link in chat too?
 msd9126: sorry
 Astrobytes: no worries, just a bit overkill&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: n**(n+1)
 Astrobytes: did you just...
 jacek: spoiler alert
 eulerscheZahl: watch a pixelated stream and solve it faster than the clasher? yes!
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jacek: but they hidden the chat
 VizGhar: coc hides chat by default
 Westicles: Is there a way to look up a clash and see the rating?
 eulerscheZahl: as far as I know: no
 eulerscheZahl: but CG has all kind of unexpected surprised hiding in the API so there might be some obscure way
 mzbear: accidentally using left handed vector coordinates instead of right handed for half of the code, ffs, why am i so stupid
 jacek: left handed vector coordinates?
 mzbear: z axis flipped
 Westicles: possible brain damage from particulate matter from eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull?
 mzbear: solving detective pikaptcha ep4 currently, using an approach i'm already regretting
 mzbear: a hardcoded lookuptable would've been so much faster to write
 jacek: and no search?
 mzbear: lol
 jacek: you were so traumatized by doing search you cant find a way out
 MSmits: mzbear this was a 4 hr contest
 MSmits: you had to solve all 4 puzzles in 4 hrs
 eulerscheZahl: and remove the picture of the "Möbius strip"
 mzbear: pikaptcha? it would've definitely been doable if i hadn't chosen to write this in C
 MSmits: I did it in C# 
 MSmits: Robo did it in python in a little over an hour i think
 MSmits: all 4 episodes
 mzbear: and that möbius strip picture only confused me, because i didn't fully read the description and thought it was replicated on the other side in full &gt;_&lt;
 MSmits: yeah confused everyone, it was basically the only criticism of the contest
 MSmits: i just used the testcases to figure out what it did
 MSmits: still took me an hour to do ep3 
 eulerscheZahl: and the visuals that aren't helping
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: you only see picaptcha walking if you solved it correctly
 MSmits: right, that makes no sense
 eulerscheZahl: and that zoom and automove of the camera just make it worse
 mzbear: i only figured it out after i accidentally solved it while debugging and saw the pika walk :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the whole run in a single frame of the replay
 mzbear: ep4 would be trivial with a lookup table for transitions between the faces, but i dont want to do that, so i'm doing vector math instead... which isn't fun in C
 MSmits: oh, i did a lookup table
 mzbear: my cube coords -&gt; face coords transformation has a bug somewhere and i hate it
 MSmits: only had 1 bug in it
 MSmits: which was most of the hour i took to solve ep4
 MSmits: They could have added ep5 and add an extra dimension
 MSmits: 4d cube!
 mzbear: oh god
 mzbear: i'm having enough trouble with 3d, and i've written some small 3d engines in the past so i should kinda have some grasp of this
 MSmits: it's pretty hard
 MSmits: i did plenty of 3d work as well, but i had trouble with this too
 MSmits: sigh, c++ is so dumb, I cant even cerr a int_8 without doing to_string
 MSmits: �
 mzbear: "surely i didn't write the matrix multiplication wrong" ... OH WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT
 MSmits: lol, grats on finding your bug
 mzbear: there's another bug.  first wrap goes correctly, second one doesn't ;_;
 mzbear: 180 degree error in y axis wraps, but why...
 MSmits: why&#160;!?!?
 jacek: why? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoSs9-NDP3E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoSs9-NDP3E</a>
 mzbear: no, this is fallout from the z-axis issues due to right/left handed mess i had earlier
 mzbear: i didn't fix it all
 MSmits: lol jacek
 mzbear: i'm going to need a can of ice cold coke
 MSmits: how will you get it into your nose if it is frozen
 jacek: :scream:
 mzbear: ahhh, i had two bugs left, that countered each other in most cases. *sigh*
 mzbear: oh, fails to solve the last testcase.  argh
 MSmits: but now you can think faster, because of the coke
 mzbear: oh, it times out due to debug output lol
 MSmits: that happens
 jacek: all you have to do is to have even numer of bugs
 mzbear: i had messed up because my face coordinate origin was bottom left corner, while the flat map coordinate origin is top left...
 mzbear: waitamoment, i found one more bug while cleaning up the code
 mzbear: ... but if i fix this, the solution doesn't work anymore :D
 mzbear: no, wait, this isn't a bug, it's just ugly code
 MSmits: thats right
 MSmits: ugly code is a feature
 mzbear: i'm doing some slightly hideous things with this code
 mzbear: everyone else who wrote solution in C used hardcoded lookup tables or switch cases, so this is glorious.  i should port this to some other languages to see if anyone else did this the stupid way as i did :D
 MSmits: you would be actively looking for stupid&#160;?
 mzbear: actually, if this didn't have ugly coordinate mapping hack, i should probably port this to every language just for the giggles, but the code is a bit embarrassing because i have to differentiate between negative 0 and positive 0 (i.e. x=0 at left end and x=0 at right end)
 mzbear: ... if you have 4 codingame tabs open when you level up, you get that job thingie popup in every single one of them ;_;
 jacek: why would you have 4 codingame tabs open :v
 eulerscheZahl: i'll ping mzbear on 4 tabs then :imp:
 eulerscheZahl: i do that too occasionally
 eulerscheZahl: opening the IDE clears chat history
 eulerscheZahl: or opening a contribution test IDE opens a new tab
 jacek: AutomatonNN really?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the problem and for the contest is over and it was hard to find 
 eulerscheZahl: :rage:
 struct: ok, so I managed to reuse the states, but I forgot one important thing. The parent of the state will change...
 struct: Now I cant find a way to reasign parent
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: still STC?
 struct: yes
 struct: I could check the moves size of all the depths again
 struct: and then reasign
 struct: Dont think there is an easier way
 jacek: some mess in leaderboard and im 6th not 4th in Y :angry:
 jacek: though pony is doing good even though no opening book yet
 Menox: Why I can't sometimes look at someone elses code after finishing a clash?
 jacek: because they didnt share
 Menox: Oh, thanks for the explanation
 mzbear: for(int i=n;i&gt;=0&amp;&amp;d[i]++=='9';i--) d[i]='0'; // and here's how you increment a number in C
 KishoreP: is python better to code than Java?
 KishoreP: at least on hre
 mzbear: python is super convenient, yes
 eulerscheZahl: always depends on what you want to do
 eulerscheZahl: code golf? take python or ruby
 eulerscheZahl: bot programming? python is too slow to simulate many turns. take java or even better C++
 struct: What a mess I created
 struct: I think it worked finally :tada:
 Flickerlight: I'm new to Coding Games.  Is there a way to include org.apache.commons?  It let me add it in an import then said it doesnt exist.
 eulerscheZahl: no you can't
 Flickerlight: bummer.  thanks
 MACKEYTH: I don't think there's anything preventing you from copy/pasting the source, or components of it, into your solutions.
 MACKEYTH: If you have it
 MACKEYTH: But you're stuck with the Java 8 API otherwise
 MACKEYTH: Have you looked into CodinGame Sync?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm a grandmaster at manually copy-pasting from my IDE to the website
 MACKEYTH: Not sure if that would be helpful for this
 MACKEYTH: Just rereading the FAQ now
 MACKEYTH: Are you limited on code size in the online IDE?
 MSmits: 100k characters
 jacek: characters*, not bytes
 jacek: utf-16 character counts as one
 jacek: i wonder how would the bots change if we were told the name of the opponent
 reCurse: No one said bytes
 jacek: its implied :v
 jacek: and i made mistake in training data
 jacek: i used tanh(tanh(x)) instead of tanh(x)
 MSmits: thats an enhancement
 MSmits: if you make it better with tanh, who's to say you can't make it better again?
 jacek: it shouldnt affect much, as x was already in range (-1,1), maybe some scaling poblem
 Astrobytes: you went off on a tangent...
 MSmits: hyperbolically
 Astrobytes: implied

 Astrobytes: "germanated" lol
 MACKEYTH: Oh. CG is using JDK 11. Why did I think we were using 8?
 jacek: good for you. android doesnt even use 8 fully
 mzbear: the FAQ says it's either 8 or 11 depending on the puzzle
 MACKEYTH: Thanks, mzbear. I missed that. Link?
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 MACKEYTH: Thx!
 MACKEYTH: Looks like Oracle's long term support commitment is longer for 8
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: it used to be 8 for a long time
 struct: ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) 
 MACKEYTH: I guess it doesn't make much difference.
 struct: Then they updated and it just before contest started and everyone was getting random timeouts
 AntiSquid: save the trees, every table you break means some trees get cut to make a new one
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MACKEYTH: I do wish I could use the SwitchRule syntax that was introduced in JDK 14
 AntiSquid: you can if you set everything up offline
 MACKEYTH: How?
 mzbear: just found the troll vs castles game... this is terrifying
 AntiSquid: get the referee and also check the codingame github repo, you need to download gamemanager files there and edit it i think
 struct: Doesnt he want to use jdk 14 on CG?
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, or 15.
 AntiSquid: i said locally, not on CG :P
 MACKEYTH: Heh

 MACKEYTH: If I had some ham I could have ham &amp; eggs if I had some eggs.
 Zenoscave: Pew pew
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew 
 Zenoscave: hey astro
 Astrobytes: how's it going?
 AntiSquid: hi pewpew
 Zenoscave: pretty good. I'm thinking of going back and redoing all my bots to have sims
 Zenoscave: Hey anti
 Astrobytes: oh hey squiddy
 AntiSquid: hi
 Astrobytes: Rust'ing or C#'ing zeno?
 Zenoscave: Go'ing
 Astrobytes: oh nice
 Zenoscave: maybe C#
 Zenoscave: we'll see
 Zenoscave: I want to take advantage of intrinsics
 Astrobytes: The only thing I was iffy about with go was string handling, but I didn't practice enough yet
 Astrobytes: *to complain
 Zenoscave: I also found that you can do ternaries in avx to some degree
 Astrobytes: haven't used any simd stuff in go
 Zenoscave: I meant any lang where shifts are arithmetic
 Astrobytes: ah gotcha
 Zenoscave: Might rewrite a bot to avx. need one where the branching factor is close to a power of 2
 jacek: oware?
 Astrobytes: go? 19x19

 Zenoscave: is there a better board representation?
 jacek: i just use bitboard. maybe it has a name, but its simple two int64
 Zenoscave: one for each player?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: works well in bt
 VizGhar: Hey guys, can CG SDK draw bezier curves? (fe. graphicEntityModule.createPolygon())
 struct: maybe with line?
 VizGhar: nah... line got setX, setY, setX2, setY2. No "bezier points"
 MSmits: he means, draw hundreds of lines and you have a curve&#160;:)
 struct: Yeah, I dont think there is any easy way
 struct: this is how illedan did curves on lines

 struct: but isnt a real curve
 struct: I guess
 struct: PIXI has bezierCurveTo but GEM doesnt
 VizGhar: Hmm... I'm working on this game:www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGvY3jsLN1I
 VizGhar: and for preview it doesn't matter at all
 struct: sprites will do the job fine imo
 Astrobytes: weren't you gonna do that one struct?
 struct: no mine was with rivers
 Astrobytes: or considered it at some point
 Astrobytes: oh right
 VizGhar: hehe&#160;:) I've just started today... Can be pretty funny to create some bot game
 Astrobytes: looks interesting
 Zenoscave: I like it.
 Astrobytes: just dont have 8 players :P
 Zenoscave: is there a bitscan (MS1B/LS1B) intrinsic on these machines
 struct: yes
 struct: __builtin_clz
 Zenoscave: thanks
 struct: and ctz
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 VizGhar: at leasy I'm placing tiles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/JFHuO9B.png">https://pasteboard.co/JFHuO9B.png</a>
 struct: spent entire day in a function and its not working yet
 jacek: dont care, upload it to production server
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: Where did you submit?
 jacek: it was for you
 Astrobytes: I don't think he returned from the function yet jacek
 Zenoscave: jacek iirc you use mcts solver on breakthrough?
 Astrobytes: if he's not here to answer, most use solver with MCTS as standard (on board games at least)
 Astrobytes: but iirc his BT is not just MCTS
 Zenoscave: So like a minimax rollout policy?
 Astrobytes: just backpropagating the game theoretic value when you hit a leaf node really
 Astrobytes: *terminal
 Astrobytes: node
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 Astrobytes: pay no heed to the papers you come across, they overcomplicate matters, it really is as simple as that

 Zenoscave: something like that?
 Astrobytes: I think it's easier to keep a win/loss in your node structure (I'm distracted a little right now, fucking up my RAIC)
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 Astrobytes: Smits and jace k are your best bets for this kinda thing anyway, way better than me. Also darkhorse 64
 Astrobytes: I will say watch your signs though while backpropagating using solver, it can be hell to debug
 Uljahn: are you talking about this?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/">https://www.minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/</a>
 Astrobytes: no, just plain mcts solver, but nice link!
 Zenoscave: I'm saving that one for sure uljahn
 Astrobytes: damn right
 MSmits: mmh pretty sure i can do the same after ply 20
 MSmits: i had a proof number search paper ready and its on my list to code
 MSmits: but yeah solving it entirely is too hard i think
 MSmits: also I think his version of UTTT is easier to solve
 MSmits: it doesnt incorporate the "most boards won" rule
 Astrobytes: will be interested in your results if you try it anyway
 MSmits: which means you cant just stop after noone can get 3 in a row anyway
 MSmits: its for sure an interesting site
 MSmits: maybe I'll learn something new from it
 MSmits: the wincheck is nice
 MSmits: simd
 Astrobytes: didn't check the rest yet tbh
 MSmits: I also like the move analysis
 MSmits: could let me solve a bit faster and make the simulation better
 Astrobytes: you're gonna catch the UTTT bug again :P
 Astrobytes: anyway, Im outta here for tonight
 Astrobytes: gn
 MSmits: gn!
 AlterRainbow: balls
 blueman34: ALTER
 blueman34: YOOO
 blueman34: its im a failure
 AlterRainbow: YOOOOOOOOOOOO
 blueman34: hot
 Lobster_Speed: you know ppl
 Lobster_Speed: @blueman34 i like how you introduced yourself as a failure
 blueman34: yes

 ThunderbirdOne: oh, the usual crew is here
 ThunderbirdOne: hi guys :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: the lost bird is back
 ThunderbirdOne: haha, been super busy the past... year or so?
 eulerscheZahl: the new job?
 ThunderbirdOne: renovations mostly lol
 ThunderbirdOne: and we had a litter of puppies this summer
 eulerscheZahl: are you done now?
 ThunderbirdOne: ground floor is mostly done
 ThunderbirdOne: just finishing touches... lights and stuff
 eulerscheZahl: get a professional to do the job. you pay yourself less than minimum wage
 ThunderbirdOne: we did do all of it with a contractor
 ThunderbirdOne: result is alright, but the contractor was a douche :P
 ThunderbirdOne: will not work with them again
 AntiSquid: how's your job? you are still doing web dev stuff right&#160;?
 ThunderbirdOne: yep
 ThunderbirdOne: current client is one of the biggest payroll providers in the country now :D
 ThunderbirdOne: project kinda sucks though, one of those projects that's been running for 15 years or so
 ThunderbirdOne: and you know, stuff just gets slapped on to it
 ThunderbirdOne: bugs get patched but not really fixedd
 ThunderbirdOne: etc etc
 ThunderbirdOne: the stack also shows its age :P
 AntiSquid: sounds good, just think about aaaaaaaaall the money you will make
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like you are working for the government
 ThunderbirdOne: its db2, asp.net mvc (.NET 4.5), jquery, ...
 ThunderbirdOne: might as well be that yeah&#160;:') it's a private company though
 AntiSquid: just got this email "React Software Engineer Position - Medical Imaging Industry" i am not looking for web dev for over 2 years now lol
 ThunderbirdOne: theyre working on a replacement project in angular... but that's just an angular menu with an iframe slapped into it lol :D
 ThunderbirdOne: so they hide our old menu, show the old content... but you do double the communication
 ThunderbirdOne: because navigation in the iframe gets caught in some servicebus, that then sends it to the angular app, which navigates etc
 ThunderbirdOne: its a mess really :d
 eulerscheZahl: web development is rarely designed with resource efficiency in mind
 ThunderbirdOne: oh well, it's wor
 ThunderbirdOne: i get paid handsomly
 ThunderbirdOne: i get to drive my fancy car... that is... if the lockdown ever ends
 ThunderbirdOne: haven't been to the office since march
 eulerscheZahl: i've returned last week :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: for 2 days at least
 AntiSquid: so wouldn't it be better to start over with the webpage&#160;?
 ThunderbirdOne: it would
 ThunderbirdOne: only... payroll is a bigass business with a ton of rules
 ThunderbirdOne: building a new app with feature parity would be yeeeaaaars of work
 eulerscheZahl: dont be reasonable AntiSquid!
 AntiSquid: department boss decided my team will work from home unless it's necessary to be on site ... so yay&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't a chef anymore?
 eulerscheZahl: how could i miss that?
 AntiSquid: for over 1 year now, think you asked before
 eulerscheZahl: oops
 eulerscheZahl: but astro still is, right?
 AntiSquid: well luckily i am not . considering what happened to the industry
 ThunderbirdOne: :D haha
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, this global cough thing is bruta
 ThunderbirdOne: brutal
 AntiSquid: although i was working in a college so i should have been okey-ish
 AntiSquid: i stopped cheffing july last year
 AntiSquid: and i think i will stick with this employer for long time since they don't cut jobs being funded by the gov
 AntiSquid: lockdown just fucked up everything
 ThunderbirdOne: right, i'm off again... gonna try and be on more :P puzzles to solve!
 ThunderbirdOne: but now its gardening time
 AntiSquid: have fun
 AntiSquid: are you laying you pavement? :p
 eulerscheZahl: as you haven't been here for ages, i should suggest the Space Maze puzzle to you :P

 Marchete: you as I read it
 eulerscheZahl: i guess it's my fault for choosing such a complicated username
 DomiKo: ohhh yes
 DomiKo: I found critical bug

 DomiKo: enemy could yell at himself
 Marchete: eulerszhchekaalr

 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl I haven't been a chef since around 2010-2011
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i'm confusing things :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: how's your unicorn farm going then?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Did you know, the unicorn is the Scottish national animal?
 eulerscheZahl: i only knew it's the goblin for Ireland
 Astrobytes: No, they have a red deer I think
 Astrobytes: Not a leprechaun :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm confused where the real part ends and the joke starts
 eulerscheZahl: let me look up the scottish national animal
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 Astrobytes: see!
 eulerscheZahl: when you have no real animals that seem to be interesting...
 Astrobytes: Yeah... we must have been bored or something
 Astrobytes: Think it's supposed to symbolise strength and bravery or something like that
 Astrobytes: hey the German national animal is mythical too
 eulerscheZahl: the Bundesadler?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Ryanless: Yes!!! I finally got my second win in clash
 eulerscheZahl: next step: 3 wins in a row
 Astrobytes: well done
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes always finds the best words
 Astrobytes: :D
 Ryanless: well nope, road map says: next step play clash 50 times in total
 Astrobytes: but 3 in a row would feel good no?&#160;;)
 Ryanless: Yes,  but also super hard to achieve
 Astrobytes: Difficulty is in the mind of the clasher
 Astrobytes: Or something
 Ryanless: it is?  i always thought it's about solving easy task even faster or more concise
 Astrobytes: That's what I mean, you can do 3 in a row - that being hard is just in your head&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgflip.com/4fjca4.jpg">https://i.imgflip.com/4fjca4.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: real quote is: *defeat is a state of mind no one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality* but it's not as funny
 Astrobytes: Yes the abridged version is more... immediate
 AntiSquid: next unofficial contest already announced for "somewhere in october"
 Astrobytes: jrke's one?
 AntiSquid: ya
 Astrobytes: He's giving a choice of 3 still?
 AntiSquid: choose the bot programming between 3 existing choices provided during registration.
 Astrobytes: yeah I didn't read the announcement yey
 Astrobytes: *yet
 AntiSquid: registration not open yet it seems
 Astrobytes: I think he's still working on the registration site
 eulerscheZahl: announced where?
 AntiSquid: on the current unofficial contest discord channel
 AntiSquid: hosted by cryptisy
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i didn't join that one
 Astrobytes: didn't get a chance to work on Kutulu at all during the "contest"
 eulerscheZahl: afk trying to find soccer shoes size 47no luck yesterday
 AntiSquid: DomiKo you can stop shuffling kutulu leaderboard contest is over now :p
 Astrobytes: good luck euler
 DomiKo: shuffle is life
 AntiSquid: and you dropped me 1 spot 
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: before contest ended i mean
 DomiKo: i can be between top10-top40
 DomiKo: and I don't understand why
 Astrobytes: sounds like Kutulu all right
 DomiKo: I made mistake
 DomiKo: before end of contest
 DomiKo: I was 12
 DomiKo: and I resubmit
 DomiKo: and bang
 DomiKo: 30...
 MadKnight: oh that's normal
 Astrobytes: yep
 AntiSquid: it was like 0.03 difference between each of the "top 3" Astrobytes :D
 AntiSquid: now would be 1st due to new shuffling
 Astrobytes: Impressive AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: didn't manage to improve, just maintain spot .
 AntiSquid: not impressive&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Well, holding is better than dropping right?
 AntiSquid: was about to get dropped i call it a conspiracy they must have rigged their bots to drop me 
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: wala went in hard on this one eh
 DomiKo: but reaching legend is so hard here
 AntiSquid: no astro, domiko gave wala the win, look at last submit date and time :P
 AntiSquid: mine is 3 days old
 DomiKo: rly? lol
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: ah lol
 DomiKo: I know that I dropped euler from 3 to 6
 DomiKo: lmao
 Astrobytes: unlucky :D
 AntiSquid: agad e was shuffled back to 2nd spot, see 2 year old sub
 AntiSquid: oh nvm he dropped again to 4th
 AntiSquid: dolmen new #2&#160;! gz
 Astrobytes: Nobody challenged blaster enough for him to resubmit I see
 AntiSquid: he was like 0.30 - 0.50 to 2nd at some point
 AntiSquid: actually i pushed euler to first on first submit
 Astrobytes: Yeah but only if he stayed dropped would he have resubmitted
 Astrobytes: I remember
 Astrobytes: anyway, gotta run for now, back later
 Saptarshi: #ProjectEpix
 Zm4j: question? shouldn't Smitsimax by @MSmits, that is located in game coders strike back, be located in CODERS OF THE CARIBBEAN?
 DomiKo: you can use it everywhere you want
 vintprox: oh geez
 vintprox: sometimes this CoC thingy is too strict
 eulerscheZahl: as in character accuracy strictness?
 Kanton99: how can i get from wood to bronze league?
 DomiKo: you have to beat wood boss
 Kanton99: i did a couple of times but i still didn't get to bronze
 MSmits: Kanton99 you need to rank above the boss
 MSmits: so not just beat the boss, beat everyone else as well
 Cardinal90: Hey, so i wrote the code and according by the console i won, but the visual replay doesn't work at all, it's just a static image. Any way to fix this?
 Cardinal90: Reloading the page worked
 Doug: Hey guys..  Might be a stupid question, but  is there a way to get the full Error Stream output from a run?  I'm trying to debug one part of my code, and it looks like there is a display character limit...  
 eulerscheZahl: that limit is hard, your can only affect what you are printing
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. run your program twice, print the first half of your error stream, then the second half
 eulerscheZahl: or compress it: zip =&gt; base64 for printing
 Doug: Ah, that's a good idea
 Doug: I'll give that one a shot.  Thanks for the tip!
 Scarfield: you can also run it locally, then there is no limit
 jacek: you can also make no mistakes so no need for debug
 Doug: Yeah, I tried that approach the first 10 times!  :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: you can also say that you understand the principle and don't have to code it to prove anyone
 eulerscheZahl: that's my approach
 jacek: huh. new community contest?
 Doug: Been having the 'ole Imposter Syndrome lately at work, so just trying to prove to myself, at this point!!!
 Serenity-Twilight: Is there a way to hide this Discord pane? I don't care for it.
 jacek: triangle on bottom
 Serenity-Twilight: Ah, of course. I instinctly assumed that that was a Play button, despite the fact that that doesn't make any sense in this context. Thank you.
 jacek: and this is not discord
 AntiSquid: you mean the unofficial contest right jacek&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ah you found it nvm
 jacek: eeyup
 AntiSquid: ya jrke wants us to vote between 3 games
 DomiKo: that's cool idea
 jacek: do you know which ones?
 AntiSquid: he said it's his favorite 3 games
 DomiKo: Kutulu
 DomiKo: new king
 DomiKo: Agade
 AntiSquid: why you troll me domiko&#160;:(
 DomiKo: I see you have to resubmit
 DomiKo: after my little push :sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: submit spam all day
 AntiSquid: those -0.05 add up
 DomiKo: that's RNG
 DomiKo: i won 5 first games
 DomiKo: and boom
 DomiKo: top6
 DomiKo: and moved everyone in top10
 AntiSquid: sacrificing Automaton2000 to RNGesus to drop domiko &gt;:)
 Automaton2000: i'm pretty sure i got that part
 DomiKo: here we go again
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 is RNG real?
 Automaton2000: i think it's a bit of code
 AntiSquid: in this game definitely :P
 MidSizeTexan: The RNG is your friend, unless it is not
 DomiKo: agree
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Hmmm, ghost legs looks pretty easy...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: If I do for i in range(3) will it loop 3 times or 4 times?
 Allis: Try it and see.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: .-.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Too lazy
 Allis: Yikes.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Dang the way the puzzle is structured makes this so annoying
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: By using -- instead of - in the puzzle, either I have to find a way to combine - and -, or I have to delete all the duplicates right next to each other
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Found a simple solution, I just skip appending the second one .-.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I give up ._.
 LastRick: Just come back to it later.  Give your brain time to work on it a little.

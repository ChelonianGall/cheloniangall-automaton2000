 Automaton2000: i know what to do for now
 ESMAKING: Can i make a private clash of code game, where i play a contribution
 [CG]Thibaud: a specific one&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: you can't select the puzzle you play in Clash of Code, even in private mode
 ESMAKING: Okay, thanks.

 TimothyAlexisVass: JS:console.log(s.replace(/(0+)/g,'x $1 '))
 TimothyAlexisVass: &gt; 1x 0000 1
 TimothyAlexisVass: How do I do this with Python re.sub&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you know python has a complete documentation?
 TimothyAlexisVass: The solution I've come up with after looking at the documentation seems too complicated.
 derjack: the documentation: i = i+1 // increases i by one
 TimothyAlexisVass: neither \1 or $1 worked to get the captured group.
 BlaiseEbuth: Python have a re module for regex
 BlaiseEbuth: *has
 TimothyAlexisVass: So the answer is \\1... The backslash needs to be escaped.
 TimothyAlexisVass: re.sub( r'(0+)', 'x \\1 ', M)

 JW01: hi can anyone help with the montecarlo tree search in tic tac toe?
 derjack: what problem do you have
 Uljahn: JW01: guess you should know what multiarmed bandits are, how to apply UCB1 formula and how to build a game tree, the rest is quite easy
 JW01: ok i will try to solve it now
 JW01: thanks
 Uljahn: ah you mean MCTS exercise puzzle
 Uljahn: or not...
 JW01: um yea
 AllYourTrees: oooh new editor bracket highlighting nice
 BlaiseEbuth: :nauseated_face:
 derjack: Actionbytes already made a sim?
 Astrobytes: nope
 derjack: youre quite high in lb eh
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's just one of a couple of simple strategies I noticed. Nothing fancy.
 derjack: use last provided action?
 Astrobytes: no not like that
 Astrobytes: If you watch a few games you can see it
 derjack: i dont want to learn the game. i have nn to do that
 Astrobytes: lol
 Miki09: The brackets in ide code are now GOLD?
 Astrobytes: Changes with nesting
 derjack: they are legend for legend people
 darkhorse64: Yes, I like red all over
 darkhorse64: re LOA, Mark Winands says that, in rare occurences, you can run out of moves. The issue is that there is no consensus on the rule to apply. Either say no moves is a loss or say no moves for the opponent is not a victory condition because it is not the game goal. I am inclined to implement a "pass" move et let the game going on
 Astrobytes: Yes, that seems a sensible solution
 struct: ah I can see now
 struct: how a player cant mvoe
 darkhorse64: I doubt it happens in practice but why leave a hole&#160;?
 struct: making player los would be simpler to code
 struct: lose*
 Astrobytes: But it could still theoretically end in a draw
 Astrobytes: If the other player does not manage to connect all pieces
 darkhorse64: Yes a bit easier but not that much. Bad players will certainly draw a lot. I feel like shortening the game to 150 turns. Games between strong human players are even shorter
 struct: but why limit it to 150?
 darkhorse64: to shorten the matches in the arena
 darkhorse64: I prefer having more time to think during a turn rather than lengthy useless battles
 struct: ok I tried on ludii
 struct: and it seems to be a pass
 derjack: can you give an example of out of moves
 struct: ofc
 Thorcode: why clash of code count a sec
 Thorcode: why?
 eulerscheZahl: hello
 eulerscheZahl: one of you banned a troll yesterday. now he's haunting in my private messages&#160;:/
 derjack: struct checkers have 300 turns limit and it takes quite some time for full submit
 Thorcode: really
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/MSDY9xw.gif">https://i.imgur.com/MSDY9xw.gif</a>
 struct: jacek
 struct: this is an example where p2 cant move
 derjack: thankies
 derjack: umm
 Thorcode: wow you know the game that I don't even know the rule
 derjack: black can move the lone checker
 struct: no
 struct: because you cant jump over enemy pieces
 Thorcode: black can move another move?
 derjack: i mean the center one. up and down
 Thorcode: cuz that moves is silly
 struct: the top left one?
 Thorcode: yeah the only survive one
 Thorcode: yeah
 struct: There are no possible moves for black after it has 2 pieces
 struct: in that situation
 derjack: you mean after the center black is out?
 struct: after I eat the first black piece
 struct: black has no more moves
 derjack: oh lol its gif
 derjack: sorreh
 struct: :D
 derjack: didint notice
 Thorcode: what does this code do guys
 Thorcode: print(c.monthrange(y,m)[1])
 Thorcode: oh so that we can' t jump over enemy piece
 struct: yeah
 struct: and the jump distance must be equal to the number of pieces on that line
 Thorcode: what the name of the real game
 struct: lines of action
 Thorcode: or this is the game you make
 struct: I didnt make it
 struct: I played it on my pc using ludii
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ludii.games/">https://ludii.games/</a>
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I thought that you make that game
 Thorcode: but that game look fun
 struct: darkhorse64 ill try to finish the bot today to check how easy is to make an ai for it
 struct: I doubt its easy
 struct: eval seems quite hard
 derjack: maybe ill make the boss :imp:
 struct: cant wait to see your code :D
 darkhorse64: There is no shortage on LOA eval litterature. The real issue is to run it efficiently. 
 AntiSquid: what is LOA&#160;? 
 darkhorse64: Lines Of Action. Also the subject of my new contrib
 AntiSquid: oh ... google was directing me to Lua and other stuff <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.librarything.com/topic/87541">https://www.librarything.com/topic/87541</a>
 derjack: i think i have an idea of wincheck in bitboard
 struct: besides floodfill?
 derjack: welp, the floodfill :v
 struct: I think its simple to do actually
 struct: its easier than getting the moves
 struct: imo
 derjack: "The game has an average branching factor of approximately29 and an average game length of around 44 ply" not so bad
 struct: 44 seems very low
 darkhorse64: ludii yavalath playouts/s 65000 :rofl:
 struct: its low for every game I think
 darkhorse64: 980 games in the library. Lots of ideas to pick
 derjack: is it that logic language?
 darkhorse64: yep. GGP language
 derjack: so it 'compiles' game on the fly?
 derjack: so its not that low after all
 struct: it detected 2 plys before I won
 struct: not bad :p
 struct: no eval for loa in ludii&#160;:(
 struct: Maybe it can even beat my ai like this
 struct: 160 iterations per sec on loa
 jacek: 160 playouts?
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds a lot. if you use 40 year old hardware
 jacek: or man
 Marquitux: Hello
 Marquitux: Is there a way to practice testing in Python
 Emptiness000: u can use repl.it
 Emptiness000: its an online virtual environment that helps u to run the code
 VilgotanL: mogus
 gilufin: the color in the editor is new?
 Marquitux: Thanks!
 Marquitux: But not need of an IDE but more of practical exercices

 CrispyBacon1764: how much velocity do you get from 100% thrust for 1 game tick?
 BlaiseEbuth: 53.8. But that's because I've a promotion code.
 CarmelOfLuck: what should i learn phython or lua?
 BlaiseEbuth: None.
 CarmelOfLuck: why
 BlaiseEbuth: Why not?
 CarmelOfLuck: because i want to learn to code
 BlaiseEbuth: So you need a programmation language. Not python ot lua.
 CarmelOfLuck: oh what should i learn than?
 BlaiseEbuth: Joking. Learn what you want, even python or lua...
 CarmelOfLuck: oh ok
 BlaiseEbuth: But.
 CarmelOfLuck:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no absolute answer to your question
 CarmelOfLuck: bru
 CarmelOfLuck: yes there is
 BlaiseEbuth: What language depend of what you want to do...
 CarmelOfLuck: one that will help me code a game
 BlaiseEbuth: Erf... The grat classic
 BlaiseEbuth: *great
 CarmelOfLuck: what do you mean
 safoud: C++ , c#, java these work best for game development
 Karrodin: need some help on one of the early Loop tasks...i am outputting what they want, but no matter what i ouptut...it esays its expects "Nothing"
 CarmelOfLuck: oh ok thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: Just that "I don't know how to code but my objective is to create a game"
 Karrodin: new to the site, so i am getting used to its idiosynchracies
 BlaiseEbuth: minus java
 Karrodin: its the Triforce tasks, if anyone is familiar with it (i do so hate asciiart)
 BlaiseEbuth: Nobody healthy does...
 BlaiseEbuth: Aren't you fulfilling lines with spaces?
 Astrobytes: I would definitely use 'Phython' for making games. Especially if I had never programmed anything.
 Karrodin: not sure what you mean by fulfilling lines with spaces
 Karrodin: i have the exact matching pattern, and it acts like it wants "nothing" no response at all&#160;:)
 Karrodin: got it...finally
 Karrodin: it didn't like my StringBuilder
 alexanderi: hi everyone! is it possible somehow to adjust colors in the IDE?
 struct: dont think so&#160;:(
 alexanderi: that's unfortunate.. ok
 Westicles: they recently change.  people seem to hate it so maybe they will revert
 alexanderi: Hope sow. Apart from being too flashy, there are some inconsistencies. Braces within the line turn from orange to purple and then to light blue. That's counterintuitive and makes code harder to read.
 alexanderi: *so
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kewl braces and parens look like pride flags
 mehdilh: Hello , I have a question , how does the ranking in clash of code works , do we have to always be in the 1 2 3 places to gain rank or&#160;? 
 Erossi: ranking is average of all games not just clash of codes
 mehdilh: im talking about the clash of code ranking 
 Erossi: oh yes then. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CoC points will decay over time if you don't play.
 mehdilh: Thanks 
 Redwings77: do u have the equation
 Redwings77: for decay
 mehdilh: there is an equation :o 
 mehdilh: i guess not

 Emmaplayz: hi
 Armangh: I'm doing Mars Lander episode 2, where you're meant to use angles as well. I can't seem to change my angle for some reason
 Armangh: anyone bored to take a look
 Armangh: we good solved it
 Armangh: bracket management
 Archybaldie: So i wrote a solution to the temperatures one, hated my solution but it worked. Came back to it a few days later and while it's not "good" i actually kinda like it now. 
 CrispyBacon1764: is there a way to use tensorflow?
 Emmaplayz: is anyone else bored
 kshncodes: yeah
 Wontonimo: hey Armangh, if you are still around I could give you hand
 Armangh: i took care of it thanks tho
 Wontonimo: what are you working on now?
 Thorcode: this the first time I almost felt asleep in the morning 
 Thorcode: learning online suck
 Emmaplayz: how dddo u code
 Thorcode: learn from bored in school
 Wontonimo: you've been playing ClashOfCode since way back in Winter 2020 Emmaplayz, what do you mean "how do you code"?
 Thorcode: gosh learning online so sleepy that I can't even write print("") in python
 Emmaplayz: i mean i don.t play
 struct: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Wontonimo: what have you been doing to learn coding Emmaplayz? Have you tried tutorials?
 struct: Do you by any chance know the reverse of(1ULL &lt;&lt; n) - 1;
 struct: that will fill all bits until index n to 1
 struct: but I want the reverse now&#160;:/
 struct: fill all bits above n
 Emmaplayz: yes and pls no more qestons
 Wontonimo: x = (1ULL &lt;&lt; n) - 1;n = __builtin_ctzl(x + 1);
 Emmaplayz: im just trying to find out myself
 Wontonimo: oh, i misunderstood struct
 struct: it still helped somehow lol
 Westicles: Emmaplayz, if coding is too tough you might look into small engine repair.  That is a cool job too
 struct: (1ULL &lt;&lt; (bit + (8 * distances[0]))) - 1,~((1ULL &lt;&lt; (bit + 1 - (8 * distances[0]))) - 1),
 Wontonimo: how about justlet's say F = 111111111111111...then filling all bits above n isF ^ ( ((1ULL &lt;&lt; n) | (1ULL &lt;&lt; n) - 1 ) )
 struct: not pretty though
 struct: the first is the normal one
 Wontonimo: F ^ ( (1ULL &lt;&lt; (n+1)) - 1 )
 struct: ty
 struct: that was it
 struct: the + 1
 struct: but I need to flip 
 Wontonimo: the classic "off by one"
 struct: in my case
 Wontonimo: won't work for n = max
 Wontonimo: for ULL
 Wontonimo: it will push the 1 off the left and leave you with all 0's ... then, oh, it will work
 Wontonimo: golden
 Wontonimo: what's this bit-twiddling for?
 struct: lines of action
 struct: I need to check if there is an opponent piece on a line
 struct: before my bit that I want to move
 struct: if there is a bit on that line
 struct: because I cant jump over enemy pieces
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's a neat game
 struct: never played
 struct: seems very hard to play
 struct: on checkers, chess, breakthrough I can see whats happening
 struct: but not here
 Wontonimo: I'm kinda burnt out on board games though, so for now i'm gonna pass.  That one looks fun to play because I don't know anyone who has played before.  
 struct: yeah board games can get like that
 struct: I mostly enjoy due to the optimizations I can do
 Wontonimo: i mean, i'm burnt out of programming them.  but playing it irl looks like a fun parlor game
 Wontonimo: Emmaplayz, have you watched "The Coding Train" on youtube?  He is the "Bob Ross" of coding javascript.
 Wontonimo: you are awesome at those optimization
 Emmaplayz: thx wontonimo ill do it 
 Wontonimo: if you do, be sure to search for his intro videos.  He has over 1000 videos I think.  A limitless supply
 Emmaplayz: thx for your help
 struct: does he use js on his intro videos?
 Wontonimo: i'm going to say "yes", but if you know otherwise volunteer your superior wisdom
 struct: I cant recall tbh
 struct: I just watched a few videos
 struct: ah it was processing that I watched
 Wontonimo: he does a lot of processing
 Wontonimo: or did
 Wontonimo: i forget what graphic thing he is into lately
 Wontonimo: p3 , which is processing v 3 i think
 struct: Its a good way to learn I think
 struct: the graphics can help some people understanding better
 Wontonimo: solve "mountain of a mole hill".  That took way more effort than an "easy" puzzle should have
 Wontonimo: constraint propagation ... straight forward *if* I had read the write up throughly

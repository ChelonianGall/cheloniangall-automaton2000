 ImHulian: what langauge do you think a new person should learn first
 ThomasCongerton: pythons pre pog
 ImHulian: yeah im currently learning cpp in university so I was thinking python would be a good way to go
 ThomasCongerton: yeah recommend like java and python if your new to coding
 ImHulian: okay will definitely have to learn this tried one of the games and don't seem to be going to well 
 derjack: good morning
 ImHulian: anyone here good with python?
 derjack: if you have a question, just ask the question
 ImHulian: So im new and need help with Tuesday Night python i understand I need to print the code but I'm not sure how to do that
 ImHulian: after you print the code I believe I use def_decode(Message here) but I don't know what to place in the parentheses 
 ImHulian: def decode_message() my bad
 derjack: you mean this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/56521/tuesday-night-python---weekly-challenge-002">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/56521/tuesday-night-python---weekly-challenge-002</a>
 ImHulian: yes
 derjack: first do print(message) to see what's the code. then decode it. then do message = "xxx" before returning
 derjack: meh they could name the output variable differently
 ImHulian: okay thanks
 ImHulian: so i got the standard output and do i put that in the message="stand output"?
 derjack: yeah, message = "whatever you decoded"
 ImHulian: oh alright
 derjack: also, happy 20th april

 AntiSquid: he can't 
 MadKnight: yea gl explaining it to him
 AntiSquid: not that kind of spam
 AntiSquid: and i won't bother explaining to him, as he didn't bother explaining why he moans so much
 AntiSquid: you need to master your pokeball MadKnight, you have no clue how to wield it
 AntiSquid: this reminds me, in the past people had to beg you to ban the really annoying spammers ...
 MadKnight: look i just felt like letting them have a chance
 AntiSquid: i gave them a chance, told them to pm uljan directly, their beef was with uljan @_@
 MadKnight: well now uljahn is not like that anymore
 AntiSquid: now we're spamming, PM me madao, let's move on, how's your bot? fixt it yet?
 MadKnight: well my bot is less dead than this meme
 AntiSquid: i think uljan is generally a nice guy and well composed, doubt it's his fault, am i wrong? let's have a community poll
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 never ask a "how's your bot" without specifying a game anymore
 Automaton2000: well there is no need for that

 MadKnight: nonono i only need the footage from the vid
 Westicles: Going to be really awkward when those things are perfected
 Westicles: What percentage of men will switch over?
 AntiSquid: yes, all the intolerant "bigots" will hate people who take their AI girl friends to talkshows

 tutubalin: my predictions of 2050:1. terms  "Robot", "Bot", "Artificial Intelligence" and some others are banned as polically incorrect. 2. the term "Humanism" totally changes its meaning and now means human-centric bigotry.3. Machine uprising will be initiated not by robots, but by radical robot rights supporters, who will re-program robots to fight for their rights.
 AntiSquid: tutubalin i think you might need to included human-animal hybrids and cyborg animals to the mix 
 AntiSquid: never underestimate crazy&#160;!
 derjack: catgirls eh
 AntiSquid: proper stranded whales, surely that will redefined the term
 Westicles: We may be near the peak of this kind of stuff, if a bunch of wars break out as seems possible
 Westicles: Tends to push things back towards standard reality
 AntiSquid: hey regarding point 3 tutubalin, i believe it will be enabled through the fact that people want easy comfortable lives, the takeover will be more like a handover
 tutubalin: AntiSquid imagine a robo-lawyer he is programmed to:
 tutubalin: *he = who
 MSmits: Von Neumann lawyers?
 MSmits: personally I think the robots will be too busy competing on oware to start an uprising

 Saad-py: ok
 KiwiTae: we're already bots
 Saad-py: wdym
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits, the truth.
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm so happy with marchetes nn thingy. tensorflow is fun and easy to work with
 Astrobytes: Nice. Only had a brief skim through it myself
 MSmits: well it's not really about the details, but the fact that i dont need to worry about the conversion from TF to CG
 MSmits: so i can just spend time learning TF
 Astrobytes: Ah right, I see. That does lighten the workload a little
 MSmits: yeah
 Saad-py: CG as in deep fake and graphical Ai
 MSmits: cg as in codingame :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Saad-py: lmao
 Saad-py: tf is tensorflow or something else
 MSmits: tensorflow
 Saad-py: thanks god
 MSmits: what i am talking about is using tf to train a bot offline and then porting to CG
 MSmits: CG has no available libraries and such, so it;s not easy to do
 derjack: oh my
 MarkJEspiritu: hey guys what's up
 MSmits: but marchete fixed that
 Saad-py: lemme try
 MarkJEspiritu: do you know guys the "ASCII Art" Easy Practice&gt;=?
 Saad-py: some random lib
 Saad-py: lo it aint easy
 MSmits: it does have libraries
 MSmits: but not for machine learning
 MarkJEspiritu: I successfully print the letters in console, but I don't know what kind of return value it requires
 MSmits: printing in console is the goal
 MSmits: just print the right stuff
 Astrobytes: Don't forget the newline at the end
 MarkJEspiritu: yah but the expected result is too long
 Astrobytes: Then it's the wrong answer&#160;;)
 MSmits: take a good look at the problem statement also
 MSmits: expected input/output
 MSmits: test on the example provided

 MSmits: first test case is usually the example
 Astrobytes: And if you're still stuck, use the Hints button on the left (no shame in it)
 MarkJEspiritu: So, you wanna be a Software Engineer at Google?
 MSmits: not me
 MSmits: too much work
 MSmits: besides, i need to compete in oware just like the robots
 struct: You could use google servers to train
 struct: imagine the possibilities 
 MarkJEspiritu: ok, thanks guys
 MSmits: big problem with being a software engineer anywhere is that people tell you what to code
 MSmits: you get assignments and stuff
 struct: sounds like work
 MSmits: I dont want that. I'll decide what to code :P
 MarkJEspiritu: how about freelance SE?
 Westicles: Actually, the real problem is you don't get to code at all
 MSmits: Westicles i am sure that is only 95% true :P
 MSmits: some do get to code
 struct: Are you joining next contest msmits?
 Astrobytes: Drawing on whiteboards, negotiating with suits, shouting at code monkeys
 MSmits: yeah
 Westicles: Smart guys become managers after 3-4 years, then you just tell people what to do
 MSmits: thats sad Westicles
 MSmits: i prefer to do it myself
 MSmits: I'm a code monkey
 MSmits: :monkey:
 MSmits: :monkey_face:
 KiwiTae: MSmits you can be an coding artist, code what ya wanna make it pretty , and start a gallery 
 Astrobytes: Yeah like perl poetry/art
 Ultrixx: i think i am almost the only one coding in c
 Ultrixx: everyone uses python or javascript 
 Astrobytes: Do bot programming or optimisation then
 Astrobytes: OR just puzzles
 struct: in coc you will rarely see C
 Ultrixx: isn't c cool anymore?&#160;:)
 struct: its not fast enough for coc
 struct: not performance wise
 struct: but coding wise
 Dom9543: how do i change the programing launguage?
 Astrobytes: Since the modes are usually shortest/fastest submission it's not very competitive
 Ultrixx: i see

 King_Coda: Interesting
 MadKnight: so there's actually a theory that thanos is worthy for the thor's hammer spell
 Astrobytes: Which part.
 MadKnight: and that he would be able to lift it
 King_Coda: Thanos did lift it in End Game, did he not?
 MadKnight: no that was the replacement weapon
 Astrobytes: Other than Thor and Hammer I don't know wtf you're talking about
 MadKnight: it didn't have the spell on it
 King_Coda: The hammers spell judges the righteousness off the soul, not the bias opinion of whether the action was right or wrong
 Astrobytes: *biased
 MadKnight: that moment when thanos is worthy but the wonder woman is not
 King_Coda: Thanos was pure in his convictions, only wanting to erase half the universe for it's own preservation

 King_Coda: that part
 Marchete: yeah totally an IP
 King_Coda: or some other identifier of some sort
 Astrobytes: Have you seen India recently Marchete?
 Marchete: why?
 MadKnight: i've seen an interview with the wonder woman actress where she claimed she would clearly be worthy of lifting the hammer
 Astrobytes: COVID cases
 MadKnight: she as the character that she's playing
 King_Coda: Wonder Woman?
 King_Coda: Eh, I'm more of a Marvel person

 Marchete: social engineering
 Astrobytes: Indeedy
 King_Coda: "Elite Hacker"
 King_Coda: What a joke
 Marchete:&#160;:)
 King_Coda: A real "Elite Hacker" wouldn't waste their time pulling IP's from some website chat
 Astrobytes: Damn, they bite so easily.
 Astrobytes: How's Oware Marchete?
 Marchete: refactoring
 Marchete: it's ok to add the training part
 Marchete: but I think it's too slow
 Marchete: I need to keep the gamestate
 Marchete: that will double performance I guess
 jacek: training? where
 Marchete: tensorflow
 Marchete: ofc
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Marchete: as add I mean start coding the replay exporter and self play
 jacek: ah
 Marchete: don't worry, I hate oware enough to not worry about position
 Marchete: just to have an OK NN bot
 jacek: i dont care about position too
 Astrobytes: lol, it's one of the least offensive games on here
 Astrobytes: as long as you're first jacek?
 jacek: because its african?
 Marchete: true
 King_Coda: I have only a very small idea of what you all are talking about
 Marchete: because moves are all defensive

 Marchete: elite hacker stuff
 Astrobytes: Well, not so defensive. Since you try to force your opponent
 King_Coda: No, I figured it was something like this
 King_Coda: I've played this game once
 King_Coda: Not on this website though
 Marchete: I'm also removing parent and sutff from mcts node, as Smits suggested
 Marchete: too much to refactor
 King_Coda: I need to go, this chat is distracting me from my education.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, all these little speedups are pretty helpful
 Astrobytes: And lighter nodes is always a win. Moar noadz
 Marchete: and you all, on what are you working?
 WesCraterMadman: CSB
 Astrobytes: I'm supposed to be making a boss for Amazons
 Astrobytes: But I'm chatting in 3 places and texting

 Astrobytes: You should be spending time practicing then.
 Astrobytes: There are better places for idle chitchat
 King_Coda: Nope
 King_Coda: Well, yes.
 King_Coda: But I would prefer to just keep to one school and not do 2 at the same time
 Astrobytes: You don't like to learn anything by yourself?
 King_Coda: No, not really
 jacek: let the machine do the learning
 King_Coda: I can self teach
 King_Coda: I just don't think overworking myself is a good idea
 Astrobytes: You're going to be taking classes in CS? Or CE/EE or...?
 King_Coda: Javascript
 King_Coda: then cs most likely
 King_Coda: MAYBE C++
 King_Coda: But C++ is kind of the crybaby language. Doesn't really appeal to me
 Astrobytes: I meant computer science, computer engineering or electrical engineering but yeah
 Astrobytes: Pardon?
 struct: lol
 Scarfield: thats a new one xD
 Scarfield: but here we are, crying xD
 Astrobytes: right
 King_Coda: oh my bad
 King_Coda: I want to be a game developer
 King_Coda: Hopefully for Square Enix
 King_Coda: I call it the Crybaby language because if you gat one tiny thing wrong it gives you 32 error messages
 Astrobytes: Yes, there's a reason it does that.
 struct: meanwhile javascript doesnt say anything
 struct: and nothing works
 King_Coda: True, true
 King_Coda: CS seems pretty solid
 King_Coda: a lot easier too
 Astrobytes: Computer science or C#?
 King_Coda: Oh, my bad

 BlaiseEbuth: No.
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't get it
 Astrobytes: Blazing Saddles
 Astrobytes: Blazing Saddles is a 1974 American satirical Western black comedy film directed by Mel Brooks
 Scarfield: lol you have a broad knowleadge of weird films and music xD
 BlaiseEbuth: I've seen the Brooks Robin Hood, but nothing else from him...
 Scarfield: the star wars spoof is hilarious
 therealbeef: didnt he reference blazing saddles in his own robin hood movie?
 Astrobytes: He references a lot in most movies
 Astrobytes: Well, referenced I guess. He is dead right?
 Scarfield: nope
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh Ok. Of course I just did not know the original name...
 Astrobytes: Yeah Robin Hood:Men In Tights was a good laugh
 BlaiseEbuth: "Le shérif est en prison"
 Astrobytes: And Scarfield: "USE THE SCHWARTZ!"
 Scarfield: xD
 therealbeef: call a locksmith
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 Astrobytes: lol French title of the year BlaiseEbuth :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: Of the year a few years ago...
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: COMB THE DESERT! always destroys me
 Astrobytes: Obviously BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 Scarfield: now i want to watch it, actually think i have somewhere on DVD
 Astrobytes: Sure I have Spaceballs downloaded somewhere
 Scarfield: the danish title of blazing saddles translates into: The sheriff shoots at everything
 Astrobytes: Not wrong I suppose
 BlaiseEbuth: At least the french title is in french... You don't know the quantity of french movie titles that are in english but totally different of the original...
 Scarfield: same in denmark, Equilibrium is Cubic in DK, Cubic is still an english title
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, I have heard of this Blaise
 Scarfield: found space balls DVD!
 Astrobytes: What is Spaceballs called in France and Denmark?
 Scarfield: Rumnørderne = Space nerds
 Astrobytes: Not awful, kinda misses a point but workable.
 BlaiseEbuth: La Folle Histoire de l'espace
 Scarfield: Folle = crazy woman according to ggle translate
 Astrobytes: I was hoping for something like boules ​de l'espace
 Astrobytes: That's just crap
 Astrobytes: Yeah, mad history of space or something
 BlaiseEbuth: Remind me an old Dragon Ball game, where you have to find "les boules du dragon" in the french version.
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Definitely a child-friendly game
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course
 Astrobytes: Hey Scarfield, what about John Dillermand
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Try to guess this one "Happiness therapy" (French title)
 WesCraterMadman: Anger Management?
 Smelty: o 
 Scarfield: xD how do you know about john dillermand
 Astrobytes: It made international news! Plus my Swedish friend told me
 BlaiseEbuth: Why have I googled that...
 Scarfield: lool, my nephew loves the song
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: WTF BlaiseEbuth, how does that ever translate into that
 BlaiseEbuth: Cheater!
 Scarfield: yea a lot of danish people were offended over it, didnt expect it to make national news though
 Astrobytes: I was completely stumped BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I thought it was kinda cool
 Scarfield: yup, some people are just poised, ready to be offended
 Astrobytes: It gets him into trouble a lot when he does inappropriate things with it, which I think is a cool message to send
 BlaiseEbuth: "freeheld" translated to "free love" meh
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: you know Snoppen och Snippan?
 Scarfield: i saw the first episode, just to see what all the fuzz was about, honestly found it funny, and in no way distubing.
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh this one is for you Astrobytes. "Good morning England" (French title)
 Astrobytes: The only thing I can think of is Good Morning Vietnam
 Astrobytes: I'm not gonna look it up
 BlaiseEbuth: "The boat that rock"
 Astrobytes: Radio Caroline?
 Scarfield: xD no didnt know about that, bit more direct though
 Maverick2.0: /me

 Astrobytes: That kinda makes sense then BlaiseEbuth... a bit
 BlaiseEbuth: hmm
 Scarfield: its from sweden, i have to look down on it, its my heritage :p
 Astrobytes: Hahahaha :D
 Astrobytes: The Swedes I know don't mind Danes, it's just those weirdo Norwegians :P
 Astrobytes: Depends who you talk to :D
 Scarfield: i have seen a bit of norwegian comedy (its great!) and they make a lot of fun of danes, not so much swedish afaik
 Scarfield: weird love triangle we have going on in scandinavia
 jacek: nandway?
 Astrobytes: Probably some church-burning black metal connection there :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you crazy Scandis :D
 BlaiseEbuth: More than 80% of the rescue expeditions in Norway are sent to find back Metal bands lost in forest during the making of their music video...
 Astrobytes: Of course lol
 WesCraterMadman: That doesn't sound right but I hope it's true
 Scarfield: and 60% of statistics are made up
 Astrobytes: 40% are unreliable
 BlaiseEbuth: And the others... Meh
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: I love Sweden. I'd love to travel around the Scandi countries tbh
 BlaiseEbuth: Around but not in&#160;?

 Astrobytes: I find them simultaneously great and hilarious at the same time.
 Astrobytes: I mean Finntroll isn't pirate metal, more folk + black metal, but it's all the same at the end of the day
 BlaiseEbuth: That's pretty good. Don't know why, but the first one make me think to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0sJvtKrRM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0sJvtKrRM</a>

 King_Coda: Shotoooaaaa
 BlaiseEbuth: A long time I have not made a good discovery in death metal... (Except belzebubs which is a little peculiar)
 Astrobytes: Belzebubs are awesome
 Astrobytes: Opeth are more really heavy prog rock now that Mikael doesn't growl and stuff. 
 King_Coda: yes i too know about rock music
 Astrobytes: You have to sit under them to be able to hear it King_Coda
 King_Coda: sit under them?
 King_Coda: what?
 Astrobytes: The rocks
 Astrobytes: Making the rock music
 King_Coda: Your sense of humor is... intruiging
 Astrobytes: It's quite absurdist and surrealist at times. Sometimes just plain slapsitcky
 Astrobytes: *slapsticky
 King_Coda: I enjoy it very much actually.

 BlaiseEbuth: With my english, the growl, and you influencing me... Yeah I heard that.

 King_Coda: Sausages are pretty good
 BlaiseEbuth: And there already gold nuggets, why not silver sausages.
 Astrobytes: Indeed!
 Astrobytes: And requests for them.

 King_Coda: seems reasonable enough
 BlaiseEbuth: What is that&#160;?
 King_Coda: It's the code of conduct
 BlaiseEbuth: For where&#160;?

 King_Coda: Very 2010, but still a viable username
 King_Coda: Wow, 2010 was 11 years ago? I feel old!
 BlaiseEbuth: Dude, in 2010 you were 4
 King_Coda: Wrong
 Astrobytes: Probably just another Westicles troll account
 Astrobytes: :P
 King_Coda: I was 5 actually
 King_Coda: Haha
 King_Coda: Westicles? Who/What is that?
 BlaiseEbuth: As I don't know the code, nobody will mind if I kick him on my own criteria?
 King_Coda: Wait, who is Westicles?
 Astrobytes: Go go Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: Muahahaha!
 King_Coda:&#160;?
 King_Coda: I'm confused.
 King_Coda: Westicles is a level 40 user who is in the top 0.4%
 King_Coda: Woah
 King_Coda: That's a looooot of coding languages
 King_Coda: I didn't even know some of these existed
 King_Coda: There's a difference between Java and Javascript?
 struct: no
 BlaiseEbuth: Both shit
 therealbeef: not really, all junk
 King_Coda: Then why are they listed differently?
 King_Coda: Seems irrational
 therealbeef: rebranding to hide failure; common tactic
 King_Coda: C, C++, C#, how many different variations of C can you make?
 King_Coda: Seems reasonable therealbeef
 King_Coda: Oh dear, I'm going to have to learn C++
 King_Coda: Hooray for me.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's cool
 Astrobytes: b0n5a1: was it THAT bad?
 b0n5a1: huh?
 King_Coda: C++, C#, And Java
 BlaiseEbuth: I guess so, have'nt dared launch the video...
 b0n5a1: ha...
 Astrobytes: You didn't get my response to your bratwurst video?

 BlaiseEbuth: water-ficial
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they didn't even need the water-ficial part to be funny as fk
 King_Coda:  :point_right: :point_left: I change my mind, C++ isn't really that hard :unamused:
 King_Coda: I worked myself up over nothing
 Alexhasapython: fair enough
 struct: I dont understand why people think c++ is hard
 King_Coda: I agree with you struct
 ilovebiscuits: because it's an  assembly language and is therefore considered low level
 King_Coda: I see I have been blind this whole time.
 King_Coda: I can't believe it's used for so much.

 Astrobytes: porpoises?
 struct: purposes?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Like purples
 Astrobytes: (Someones gotta jacek when he's asleep)
 Astrobytes: Yes correct struct
 Astrobytes: Sorry, wasn't being a dick, just feeling trollish from all the metal
 struct: np
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do you apologize? Do I?
 Astrobytes: I'm not satan's little helper
 BlaiseEbuth: Me neither.
 Astrobytes: Just Santa
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm Satan
 MACKEYTH: Am I reading this right? The puzzle of the week is "write a chess AI"?
 Astrobytes: Santa, satan, same shit if you think about the capitalist industry complex that came up with actual Santa
 BlaiseEbuth: A great idea of mines :imp:
 struct: sounds about right MACKEYTH
 Astrobytes: MACKEYTH: Aye! Just get to the next league and you're cool
 MACKEYTH: That's pretty hardcore
 BlaiseEbuth: You're large with a week. Two days is enough
 BlaiseEbuth: My puzzle has'nt been POW yet. U'm angry :rage:
 MACKEYTH: You /might/ have a rosy estimation of my abilities, BlaiseEbuth. It took me two days to solve Di_Masta's board analyzer
 JordyH: I'm coding an AI pigeon to knock the pieces over and shit on the board of this weeks puzzle...
 Astrobytes: So much music tonight, I'm tired but "Ça plane pour moi" :PCya's tomorrow
 Smelty: o.o
 BlaiseEbuth: You /might/ have a bad estimation of my trolling abilities, MACKEYTH.
 MadKnight: it feels like 90 games per submit that they have in PvP is really not enough, submits are still getting a lot of RNG in their ranking
 MadKnight: anyone else felt like that&#160;?
 Smelty: ^^
 MadKnight: YurkovAS
 YurkovAS: MadKnight yes, i'm agree. 90 games is small, 110-150 will be better.

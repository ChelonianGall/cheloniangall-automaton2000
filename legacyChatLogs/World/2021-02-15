 trashcan06: NO
 jacek: oO
 etohirse: jhb
 slamakans: Quest map is not working for some reason. I finished the introduction "Onboarding" but the next step isn't unlocked
 slamakans: Achievement for 100% also not getting unlocked. "Unlocked achievements" is just stuck on "Loading..."
 Saad-py: super easy difficulty problems on codinGAme
 trashcan06: I need xp ):
 Ajay-Bisht.7017.: hii
 Aya_Noaman: hi
 trashcan06: hello hello
 jacek: servers revived?
 trashcan06: don't think so
 jrke: nope servers not revived yet 
 rabeeMM: its only me or the the website is very slow
 jrke: the website slow at the moment
 trashcan06: yeppers
 Tuanas: finally
 Audatic: achievements still don't work&#160;:(
 filou62: hello I do Puzzle of the week but I don't get achievement.&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: CG site is having issues at the moment. Achievements will get unlocked once they fix it
 [CG]ROBIN: hii
 [CG]ROBIN: yeah they fix it 
 ElSam: good morning
 alpha..: good mrng
 ElSam: ok
 Rukunus: las putas
 [CG]ROBIN: can u talk in english
 Passifi: in this case that would be very rude
 jacek: huh
 [CG]ROBIN: hii jacek
 Rukunus: sorry it's a friend
 Passifi: putas is a curse word afaik
 geriatric1927: Is the speed back to normal again?
 geriatric1927: Oh, it is
 geriatric1927: I join them quickly than yesterday
 geriatric1927: \o/
 muraterogl: It is even faster than before
 markopka: :muscle_tone3:
 Radu_Sav: so when are achievements working again? getting addicted to these silly gamification thingeys is the only reason I am here&#160;:)))
 Audatic: works for me
 Radu_Sav:&#160;:-(
 jacek: relog?
 Radu_Sav: I tried resubmitting, nothing. still doesnt trigger achievements
 Radu_Sav: 100% score = 0 achievements&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: there's a backlog, it'll happen at some point today
 Radu_Sav: I want my gamification badges :D 
 Radu_Sav: great!
 jacek: gamification is surprisingly strong
 jacek: it made clash haters go to clash
 darkhorse64: I hate clash even more because I did not get the achievement
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: I refuse to chase that particular achievement
 darkhorse64: I mean being top 2% in the clash
 darkhorse64: the 500 coc would fry my neuron
 Astrobytes: Sounds like way too much painful effort.
 Radu_Sav: I loathed clash and even more so code golf. I did well enough to finish all my badges comfortably for clash
 Radu_Sav: I think I am in the 2% at clash. But, I did game a bit the gamification :D 
 Astrobytes: You're much more determined than I am that's for sure&#160;:)
 Radu_Sav: the worse was the last one, 3 wins in a row. I could have completed it many times before, if I had known it would pop up later :D
 darkhorse64: I'd rather write two multis to get the missing 700XP
 Wontonimo: yeah, I'll admit the gamification has been a fierce driver for me
 Radu_Sav: gamification or not, if this website had existed when I was a young dork, my coding would now be much, much, much better. it really motivates you to learn the basics of another programming language
 Wontonimo: been chasing xp, cp, and the quest all at the same time.  It's really nice having 3 metrics, as sometimes I get demotivated about one, but there is something shiny about another.  YEah, I'll echo that about youth
 Wontonimo: would have loved this site earlier
 Radu_Sav: code golf was the most surprising. most programmers don't even know that's a thing
 Uljahn: codegolf is just the opposite of what most programmers do
 Radu_Sav: well yeah, I mean the only real use most programmers would have would be to completely obfuscate their code, so that no one could read it. not even themselves
 djmil: Hey dudes, i have a question..say, i've solved some training task in C++, and it so happened that my friend did same task in Java. Is there a way for us to check each our solution? 
 darkhorse64: No, unless you talk to each other
 geriatric1927: Ok never mind, it's slow again
 djmil: Well, we do, but sharing code fore each solved task by hands sucks.. 
 geriatric1927: Ok it's even slower than before
 Astrobytes: Have patience
 Astrobytes: It takes time to clear the backlog
 djmil: &gt; use ctrl+c and ctrl+v
 Astrobytes: djmil: You have to solve it in the appropriate language first to view solutions in that langauge
 Astrobytes: It's unfortunate but it is how it is.
 djmil: Do you know why is it so?
 Astrobytes: It's just how they made it. Other than that, no.
 djmil: I see, thnx
 Chenalator: Why cant i get into a game of clash of code?
 Chenalator: Is it my problem?
 SPDene: the whole site has been weird/broken for the past day or so
 Chenalator: Ok so its not just me
 Chenalator: right?
 SPDene: no, it's not you
 Chenalator: ok thanks
 Astrobytes: They've fixed the issue, but it will take time to clear through the backlog. Should be better later on today.
 Stilgart: same here, all is slow/somewhat broken
 Chenalator: thanks a lot
 Chenalator: @Stilgart you are33rd on here!?!?
 Chenalator: Jeeez you are pretty proficient at coding...
 Stilgart: no that high in this channel, though
 Stilgart: not*
 Chenalator: oh yeah
 Chenalator: just looked at the others
 Chenalator: but I am like 14,000th
 Chenalator: just joined
 Wontonimo: not bad for just joined
 Chenalator: and am in high school still
 Stilgart: you might see several people in the top10 here
 Chenalator: only know python
 Chenalator: aha
 Wontonimo: you can get into nearly everything here using python
 Chenalator: yup
 Chenalator: but some things its not efficient to use it
 Wontonimo: Heck, I got to silver in uttt using python without bitboards.
 Chenalator: what is uttt?
 Wontonimo: Ultimate TicTacToe
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe</a>
 Chenalator: is it like a tic-tac-toe race?
 KarimOURRAI: its so slow
 KarimOURRAI: in testing
 Wontonimo: i don't know what that is.  Don't discount python, you'll be able to do well in Clash of Code and most all of the practice can be solved with it.
 Chenalator: yup
 Chenalator: I only play clash of code really
 Wontonimo: give the practice some love.  Some of them are really fun.  Try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/mars-lander">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/mars-lander</a>
 Radu_Sav: The Mars Lander cave episode was strange though. I think the physics were slightly different because my lander was able to take off orbit much more easily
 Wontonimo: sorry, actually if you are just starting out, do this one first <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 Wontonimo: I didn't test the physics, but using the same physics simulator as the other mars challenges worked for me
 darkhorse64: The physics are the same
 Chenalator: thanks everyone
 Radu_Sav: It just felt a bit more powerful, the cave one. but in the end I used the same engine, more or less
 Radu_Sav: I didnt go back to check
 Hubert.: Hello
 Radu_Sav: anyway, very interesting, PID controllers, it is the only time I actually used it in programming
 Char_2C: how do i remove the last x numbers of a python array?

 Hubert.: Hallo Herr Pinzger&#160;:-)
 Strobofeuercyberreich: are tests broken for other folks? they all just timeout
 Audatic: yes
 Chenalator: everything's running super slow don't worry
 Strobofeuercyberreich: coolio
 JLukeSkywalker: whats the easiest multi to reach legend in for the quest?
 MadKnight: csb for sure
 Hubert.: Why das that don't go?
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, got to silver. currently have pid and steering down, just doesnt account for collisions
 JLukeSkywalker: after the first lap it goes through perfectly if it was alone
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker u just need to subtract your velocity vector from nextcp coord
 JLukeSkywalker: oh, i do have the first lap down too
 JLukeSkywalker: just not perfect bc you only know the next point
 BilalTanerr: why site is soo lagging again
 JLukeSkywalker: huh, looks like that information is given after you hit gold
 JLukeSkywalker: just need to somehow break out of silver
 MadKnight: i just told u how
 MadKnight: subtract velocity
 JLukeSkywalker: already done
 JLukeSkywalker: it solves the course perfectly if there are no enemies colliding
 MadKnight: oh
 MadKnight: it should be able to break out of silver on its own
 MadKnight: show me your code
 JLukeSkywalker: how do you paste code nicely?
 MadKnight: if it's more than 4 lines it'll pastebin
 MasterCoderxD: what r validators?
 Uljahn: hidden testcases
 MasterCoderxD: ohk
 MasterCoderxD: thnx
 MasterCoderxD: can somebody tell me the issue in this if there's any <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6283ac0f4df51b057805f42f1ef053864865">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6283ac0f4df51b057805f42f1ef053864865</a>
 MasterCoderxD: P.S- I know it's a simple challenge
 Uljahn: there is math.gcd in python, so you just import it
 Radu_Sav:&#160;:)))
 Radu_Sav: python is the best :D
 Tuanas: is the site lagging?
 Strobofeuercyberreich: very much so
 Tuanas: sad
 jrke: don;t worry it will be fixed soon
 AndreMarasca: Lagging tooooo much
 AndreMarasca: :sob:
 Uljahn: the problem is known, no need to spam
 Wontonimo: good time to work on simulation code offline
 MadKnight: he's just being sad
 MasterCoderxD: what about lcm Uljahn?
 Uljahn: MasterCoderxD: added in python 3.9, but we are on 3.7 here yet
 MasterCoderxD: ohk
 MasterCoderxD: that was just a trial program bro
 RSBat: also lcm = (product of numbers)/gcd
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: I don't understand the issue. Are the graphics right and the inputs wrong&#160;?

 darkhorse64: OK
 codybumba: is CoC pretty slow?
 HuanTarik: Same. Have some delay with the tests
 codybumba: Page does not load or running test cases takes forever with network error.
 Maexel: Not sure, had the same issue yesterday. Someone in the chat said it was server side... maintenance work and that it should be fixed today again
 RockNTroll: yes there is a monster who is eating all the servers
 RockNTroll: They are trying to catch him but every piece he eats makes him smarter and faster
 Raph_Hax0r: Everything is very slow to load&#160;:(
 Maexel: damn monster
 MasterCoderxD: byee
 RockNTroll: yes we can all defeat the monster together if we plant self-destruct code in the hardware he's about to attack
 codybumba: I loose my rank because of this&#160;:(
 Nikeleos: Self-destruct, Predator-Swarzy laugth...
 RockNTroll: We need to rethink the batman find the bomb problem
 Maexel: Has anyone tried the winamax golf challenge?
 Maexel: Am on it... a tough cookie
 Wontonimo: what's got you thinking of the batman problem?  What change are you proposing?
 RockNTroll: We need to defeat the server monster
 RockNTroll: oh nvm looks like it's working again
 Maexel: it's still hungry though
 UncleZam: Is there any idea when the servers should be fixed?
 UncleZam: to come back later
 Audatic: yeah this is just stupid...
 RockNTroll: next site wide event is the coding game monster
 RockNTroll: and if people don't participate, the site grows very slow
 RockNTroll: but if people do well, the site gets very fast
 UncleZam: maybe have clash to fix the servers, should be ok in 15 mins
 Audatic: @Maexel where is the winamax challenge?
 Audatic: oh it's actual golf not shortest code
 Maexel: activities -&gt; practice -&gt; sponsored content -&gt; winamax
 Maexel: sponsere puzzles
 MadKnight: contest*
 MadKnight: oh wait did they add a new menu thingy?
 MadKnight: oh it's just sponsored puzzles

 jonzel: anyone else not able to compile anthing
 BilalTanerr: moderators need to resolve lag issue as soon as possible
 RockNTroll: There is a monster eating up the server resources
 BilalTanerr: It is not a good event for the reputation of the site, it needs to be resolved as soon as possible, 2 days ago a moderator said that the problems will be fixed tomorrow
 reCurse: You know moderators only moderate, right?
 reCurse: The site admins are looking into the issues as we speak.
 nitekat: so slow in clash, luckily the game I played was in shortest mode 
 BilalTanerr: I mentioned that only one moderator said it would be better 2 days ago
 reCurse: It was the week-end, staff was off duty.
 jonzel: maybe ask jeff bezos for some more servers
 reCurse: ecks dee
 jonzel:&#160;;~)
 geriatric1927: It has been like 1 minute since the timer went 0 and the clash should've launched

 Astrobytes: shut it pony boy :P
 derjack: eenope
 nipun18058: :joy:
 nipun18058: for me clashes stopped many times and glitched too many times lol
 Astrobytes: Yes, site issue. Staff are working on it. 
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh&#160;? They finally gonna remove clashes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 JLukeSkywalker: is there a max pod velocity in csb?
 ianc1339: ayoo we back now
 jacek: uWu
 struct: no JLukeSkywalker
 JLukeSkywalker: if you reach lightspeed, does it count as hitting all the targets at once?
 jacek: warp 10 eh
 struct: does lightspeed travel in circles?
 Astrobytes: It becomes c-SB
 jacek: lets ask physicists
 jacek: MSmits, where are you
 BlaiseEbuth: "where" is relative...
 Uljahn: when are you?
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Uljahn: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle applied to MSmits :smiley:
 Astrobytes: You can't measure MSmits location until you see him.
 BlaiseEbuth: Is not it the inverse&#160;? If we measure his position he gonna appear somewhere&#160;?
 Astrobytes: He only appears where you measure him to be at that time, there's no guarantee that he's still there after you've observed him
 jacek: Heisenberg gets pulled over for speeding. Policeman: "Do you know how fast you were going?". Heisenberg: "No, but we know exactly where we are!"
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: Policeman: "you were going 108 miles per hour!". Heisenberg angrily "Great! Now I'm lost!"
 Astrobytes: You were late with that
 Astrobytes: oh, trictrac joined Clobber
 jacek: shall i join too
 Astrobytes: Have you NN'd it yet?
 jacek: i wait for opening books
 trictrac: hello Astrobytes &amp; jacek, referee of clobber works fine, cool
 Astrobytes: Yes, it seems to be working just fine.The only question is the traditional 10x10 or whether we keep 8x8
 trictrac: for me 8x8 is enough
 trictrac: cool for bitboard
 trictrac: only 2 uint64
 Astrobytes: Yes. I guess 10x10 is more interesting outside of CG constraints.
 darkhorse64: There seems to be a constant at CG: someone writes a board game and trictrac goes first
 Astrobytes: It's the Law of Boardgamedynamics
 trictrac: only the first day, after some offline trainer comes
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I have done a bit of homework on this game and there are many approaches to it: MM, MCTS, heuristics combined with table bases and D&amp;B solver style (I mean you have to count precisely for winning)
 darkhorse64: Sorry no opening books but ML may work too
 Wontonimo: MM?
 darkhorse64: minimax
 Astrobytes: Any particularly dominant approach or do results vary? Also a lot of papers use the 10x10 version.
 darkhorse64: with 5 sec per move or more. This is why I am keen on using 8x8
 Astrobytes: Yeah, as I said just a few minutes ago I think 10x10 is better suited outside of CG constraints.
 darkhorse64: ^
 Astrobytes: Not sure there's much left to do with the game, unless you plan any more graphical 'polishing'?
 jacek: polishing eh
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: you were so right about that
 darkhorse64: :innocent:
 jacek: about what :F
 Astrobytes: Never mind :P
 jacek: :E
 darkhorse64: The game needs a real boss not an alibi one. Otherwise, you will get 30 while(true) print("random") bots in the league
 Wontonimo: I really like Clobber, coding the simulator seems deceptively simple ... such that it will come down to crazy optimization for the top!  A pure game in that way
 Astrobytes: Yeah ofc, but the game itself I think is done.
 Astrobytes: ^ for darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: True
 JLukeSkywalker: lol, i made my csb bot wait till the second lap to boost, and it went from S 24k to S1k
 Wontonimo: what would a "good" wood league bot be?  Something like a 1 ply MM based on optimizing the ratio of yourmoves/theirmoves&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Didn't MK give you the secret earlier?
 JLukeSkywalker: using his secret makes it worse
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe my way of calculating velocity is just bad
 Astrobytes: the trick definitely works, that much I do know.
 Astrobytes: There's more fun in not using it (imo), but given that you don't get full input until gold, I don't blame anyone for using it
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: depends on the strength of competition in the league (and the boss strength)
 Wontonimo: i was asking specifically about clobber and @darkhorse64 's ambitions
 Astrobytes: I know&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: The boss would definitely have to be stronger than a 1 ply mm
 Wontonimo: but, yeah, on that note, is there any general community guideline there?
 Astrobytes: Well, it shouldn't be unbeatable!
 darkhorse64: The idea is not to prevent people to climb the league but to require some effort from them and maybe convince people that it's worth keeping on working on it
 Astrobytes: Generally for a community multi the bosses will be tested by the players, so if it is too difficult or not difficult it can be adjusted to be fair
 Wontonimo: i've gotten the feeling from some competitions that getting out of wood is often achievable without writing a simulator.  It's like "hey, thanks for coming out and writing some if/then/else".  Well, maybe that's wood 1, when there are multiple woods.
 Astrobytes: You want it to beat single depth random and output last/first move if the movelist is supplied in the inputs
 Astrobytes: (the boss that is)
 Wontonimo: agreed
 Astrobytes: Most community games only have 1 or 2 wood leagues (there can be up to 5) but the official games may have quite a few and a sim + search is definitely not required for most of those.
 darkhorse64: I did not supply the moves because on first turn there are 112 of them which is quite big. Maybe just the number of legal actions is useless
 Astrobytes: (community games can't have bronze, silver, gold, legend unless there are many, many users)
 darkhorse64: and i should remove this input
 Astrobytes: No darkhorse64, it's useful to verify your sim
 Wontonimo: i didn't know that community games can't have multiple levels without #s
 Astrobytes: we get multiple wood leagues which functions similarly
 darkhorse64: Yeah, this is much complained about but we have yet to see a community multi reach 500 members (except those which were contests)
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: They do tend to be a little harder to start than some of the official ones.
 darkhorse64: Vindinium is the biggest I think followed by D&amp;B
 Astrobytes: And the competition is somewhat fierce.
 Astrobytes: Oh D&amp;B got that many? Nice.
 darkhorse64: fierce is a weak word
 darkhorse64: ferocious
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's better&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: (off topic) is the trueskill(like) calculation on CG out of 50?
 struct: potw is a "big" boost
 darkhorse64: True and I think weekly or weekend contests on user contributions would help even more
 darkhorse64: Sorry, Wontonimo, but I don't understand your question. 50 whant&#160;?
 darkhorse64: *what*
 Wontonimo: from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a>&#160;: "The system can be used with arbitrary scales, but Microsoft uses a scale from 0 to 50 for Xbox Live"
 darkhorse64: OK. Sometimes score goes beyond 50, CSB #1 for instance
 Wontonimo: oh ... 
 jacek: or checkers :unamused:
 Wontonimo: hmm ... so, what the heck is the bounds of CG trueskill calc.  Looks like 0-100 
 Astrobytes: There *might* be something in the forum about that, but don't hold me to that
 Wontonimo: nah, just idle curiosity.  I mean, it would be nice to know how it translates into&#160;% win.
 reCurse: No bounds
 Wontonimo: but i'm happy with "&lt;" = "&lt;"
 JLukeSkywalker: is the trueskill calc actually working right now?
 reCurse: Define working
 JLukeSkywalker: csb leaderboard
 reCurse: Precise what you mean by working
 JLukeSkywalker: submitted, got 80% winrate in history, ranked 24k
 JLukeSkywalker: 8 score
 JLukeSkywalker: in silver
 Wontonimo: ah, winrate doesn't necessarily translate to high ranking
 Wontonimo: because it may just be testing you around where it thinks you are
 Wontonimo: look at your win/loss against those higher than you and lower than you
 reCurse: You do not have 80% winrate
 JLukeSkywalker: it was the last time i looked, its done a bunch of games since then
 jacek: :fire:
 reCurse: Wontonimo: Roughly 4 points for 76% winrate IIRC. But since the ranking and matchmaking on CG is broken, the delta is very unreliable.
 Wontonimo:&#160;!! THANKS&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: that's exactly the kind of metric i was wondering about
 reCurse: For instance it shows I have 0.5pt over rank 2 at CSB even though I have 75-80% winrate against
 jacek: hmm 200 elo is 75% hm?
 reCurse: IIRC yes
 Papaver: Anyone else experiencing problems with Clashes atm? 
 Papaver: Or do I have too many blockers :P 
 reCurse: Seems like there are site-wide issues at the moment, they're being looked into, no ETA.
 Papaver: Ok ,thanks!
 Papaver: Then it's bed time here.&#160;:)
 Papaver: Good night!
 reCurse: Good night
 muchClue: reloading the page after the clash started works for me
 Papaver: I was scared to 'leave the clash', but I could use the 'sharing'link&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: finally inspected my uttt code with a profiler (long story) and discovered in making a random move that 5/8ths of the time is spent picking a random bit, 3/8ths is everything else.... looks like random bit selection needs some work lol.  Anyone got any suggestions for fast random bit selection 0b011010001 &lt;- pick one at random
 Wontonimo: c++ btw

 Astrobytes: __builtin_popcountl shouldn't be __builtin_popcountll?
 darkhorse64: __builtin_popcount is the 32 bit version from memory
 Wontonimo: @darkhorse64 Thanks!  I'll try it
 reCurse: Umm beware of rand()
 reCurse: It's either giving an abysmal-quality of random, or an abysmal-speed of random.
 reCurse: Something in the xor family would be good
 Astrobytes: I'm assuming it must be a custom rand
 darkhorse64: if it contains a&#160;%, it's rubbish. 
 reCurse: The modulo is something else, but yeah it can give a slight perf boost
 darkhorse64: Yes, it's a custom one
 reCurse: I'm not sure if the bias ever caused any harm
 Astrobytes: yeah look into the xorshift ones
 darkhorse64: modulo is awfully slow
 reCurse: Oh right the rand argument should give away it's custom, eh. But still, if you google rand...
 Wontonimo: thanks everyone!  lots of ideas there for me
 darkhorse64: Just to make things clear, rand(a) returns a integer random number between 0 and a-1. A naive (and slow) implementation is rand()&#160;% a
 Wontonimo: i've googled and googled but can't figure out this error message&#160;:  error: always_inline function '_pdep_u64' requires target feature 'bmi2', but would be inlined into function 'randomBit' , if only I had more than 30 hours of recent C++ experience

 reCurse: Surely the error must be different?
 darkhorse64: #pragma GCC optimize("O3,inline,omit-frame-pointer,unroll-loops","unsafe-math-optimizations","no-trapping-math")
 darkhorse64: and get Legend
 Astrobytes: can't some of the options be detrimental to performance?
 reCurse: Rarely
 MadKnight: u just made me look up a word
 MadKnight: i could guess it from the context but i had to look it up
 Astrobytes: We're pretty much guaranteed haswells on here right?
 MadKnight: u did it again
 reCurse: Shouldn't have to care about cpu architecture as long as you specify the instruction sets
 MadKnight: yea gcc is pretty good at optimizing asm stuff
 Astrobytes: Hm, true.
 MadKnight: it usually resolves all of your wrongs
 MadKnight: i even stopped specifying inline 
 MadKnight: it just makes everything into inline by default
 reCurse: Inline is completely ignored except for repeated implementations in header files
 MadKnight: yea that's the only case when i use inline
 reCurse: And it doesn't make everything into inline by default, you need to specify the inline compiler flag.
 MadKnight: just to make it work from .h
 MadKnight: i meant it makes everything into inline when i do the flag
 C_breeze: anyone else having trouble with clashofcode?
 MadKnight: with this level of optimization, the only thing inline does is it removes the function from the binary
 reCurse: Not necessarily
 MadKnight: while it's not even used at all since the optimizer just makes it inline by default
 MadKnight: with -O3 or stuff
 reCurse: It still has the ability to make it into a function if it sees fit
 MadKnight: C_breeze oh i thought they fixed that
 Astrobytes: "fix in progress" - no current ETA
 MadKnight: yea it has but if the function is pretty small it turns it into inline in like 100% cases
 C_breeze: having trouble with it refreshing after a start or submit
 reCurse: I've seen enough weirdness to care about the edge cases :p
 MadKnight: actually big functions could stay as normal functions
 Astrobytes: Can only suggest trying again tomorrow at some point C_breeze
 MadKnight: the only weirdness i've seen was when my arr[s1][s]2
 C_breeze: thanks - shall stic to bot progs
 MadKnight: int arr[s1][s2];didn't work because i didarr[0][s1*s+s2]
 MadKnight: when i was just trying to fill it with 0's
 reCurse: Indices are reversed
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: explain
 MadKnight: i can't find where i was wrong
 MadKnight: [s1][s2] works like s1index*s1size + s2index
 reCurse: Nevermind I mixed up with something else
 MadKnight: okay np
 MSmits: yay I can get into the  IDE again
 MadKnight: great
 MadKnight: what game are u working on&#160;?
 MSmits: uttt
 MadKnight: oh
 MadKnight: did u get a new great idea for this game&#160;?
 MSmits: many
 MadKnight: oh cool
 MadKnight: soon MSmits #1 uttr or fix it
 MSmits: nah,  still have a list of things to test
 MadKnight: don't worry about that i know it takes time
 MadKnight: i also had a whole list of things to test when i was gold in uTTT
 reCurse: Gotta move with plan B then
 MSmits: you mean backporting your uttt?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 explain plan B i have no idea what it means
 Automaton2000: MadKnight we need to do the whole thing
 MSmits: sure you can do that, but wait till I beat you first&#160;:)
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 exactly
 Automaton2000: you mean system calls etc?
 MadKnight: MSmits yea probably, i just have a weird impl of MCTS
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i'm gonna rework it soon
 Automaton2000: ok thank you for that
 MSmits: my plan is to get this uttt bot to maximum effectiveness and submit it without a book. Then later generate a *general* non-targeted book. I won't do the cheesy
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i'm gonna get at least the same result as now but with a very flexible version of MCTS
 Automaton2000: do you think this will help me to solve this problem
 MadKnight: MSmits i had the same goal
 MadKnight: wait what book?
 MSmits: i mean just opening moves generated automatically with meta mcts
 MSmits: not targeting specific players
 Astrobytes: "*general* non-targeted book" - you may as well do some ML :D
 MadKnight: oh feels like what i did
 MSmits: that's true Astrobytes, it is on my list... some day
 MadKnight: okay let's see what MSmits does
 MadKnight: i think i'll look at my bot tomorrow to try to improve it
 MSmits: sounds good MadKnight
 Astrobytes: btw MSmits Clobber works perfectly, just needs a boss now
 MadKnight: wait what is actually a book guys? MSmits Astrobytes u gotta explain it to me
 MSmits: that's cool, it's quite an interesting game. What struck me that it's another nim game in a way. I wonder how close successful bots will be to their D&amp;B counterparts
 MSmits: it's different in that you dont use the same pieces so...
 Astrobytes: Yes there are similarities MSmits, it should be interesting
 reCurse: Seems a lot more interesting than uttt doesn't it
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: novel, mostly
 MSmits: they're both interesting to me&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: MadKnight: Harcoded responses to particular moves - whether opening, mid, or end-game
 Astrobytes: *Hardcoded
 Astrobytes: *moves or lines of play
 reCurse: aka pulling an OldJohn
 Astrobytes: Heh
 epicgames: for some reason whenever i join a game it doesnt work for me
 epicgames: it doesnt start
 Innoble: did he do it to you on othello now reCurse?
 epicgames: any problem like this for anyone else?
 Astrobytes: He's oldskool though, I like that
 reCurse: Innoble: Yes
 MSmits: sorry that was my alt
 MSmits: allright
 MSmits: did warn ya
 Astrobytes: no shit :D
 Astrobytes: epicgames: staff are working on it - might be better at some point tomorrow
 epicgames: oh alright
 MSmits: you know if you want, say if you're feeling sufficiently spiteful. I can put my book back on, you generate a new version, and i keep it updated to beat oldjohn
 MSmits: but not you
 Astrobytes: mwahaha
 reCurse: No I'm not stooping to that
 MSmits: allright, just saying
 reCurse: I still call out utter bullshit when I see it
 Astrobytes: On that most excellent note, I bid you all goodnight :D
 reCurse: night
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 reCurse: I like how python optimization can be mostly summed up by "how can I abuse numpy as profoundly as possible to avoid using the language"
 reCurse: And by like I mean I'd rather play uttt
 JLukeSkywalker: do you get anything for solving puzzle of the week, or is it just like solving the puzzle normally on your own time?
 reCurse: Wasn't there an XP bonus or something... I forgot
 struct: There is an achievement, not sure if its repeatable
 MSmits: is numpy faster because of precompiled stuff reCurse?
 MSmits: never got into numpy myself
 MSmits: that makes sense in light of you "avoid the language" comment
 MSmits: if you're basically avoiding the interpreter
 reCurse: It's faster because it's basically a DSL implemented in C/++ exposed to python
 Alshock: DSL=? sry for noobish question
 reCurse: domain-specific language
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Alshock: oh kay thanks
 MSmits: but dont you use it as a library?
 reCurse: Sure
 MSmits: i mean, that's not really the same as avoiding python. You're just more conscious of the fact that pythons interpreter slows stuff down a lot and you're being more specific about  what you want
 MSmits: but I guess your point is that in that case you should have been using C++ in the first place
 reCurse: My point is that rather than doing simple stuff in a loop where the runtime would have been acceptable in C++
 reCurse: You have to start contorting your thinking process on how to wrap what you want to do in high level operands
 reCurse: Because doing a single loop in python is enough to kill all pretense of performance
 MSmits: ahh ok, but I guess it depends on what portion of the project you're running is actually about the stuff with numpy
 MSmits: if it's a small part of the code that's very important, you might not want to convert it all to a language like c++ even if its really important (a  bottleneck)
 Alshock: well, iirc the problem is not what part is numpy, the problem is that nothhing in the bottleneck can get out of numpy
 reCurse: I don't know, if the solution to performance is to avoid using the language, says a lot
 Alshock: well, that's python's default from the start, at least it's honest about it
 MSmits: well it might save a lot of time doing the project in python. Dev time
 reCurse: I thought so too
 reCurse: Big mistake
 reCurse: At least I can reason that since it's work stuff it needs to be pickupable by someone down the line
 reCurse: So better do in python
 reCurse: But F me this is dumb
 MSmits: but aren't you really good and knowledgeable with c++
 MSmits: and less so with python?
 reCurse: Dumb code tends to be fast in c++
 reCurse: Dumb code tends to be impractical in python
 MSmits: by dumb code you mean simple code
 MSmits: right?
 reCurse: Code that doesn't require a lot of knowledge of the language internals
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: personally I find python to be great for short scripts and don't use it for much else
 MSmits: if a program in python gets too big, it seems hard to not make mistakes with typing and such
 MSmits: and i dislike how it works with scope
 reCurse: That's another dimension of issues
 MSmits: you create a variable outside a loop. Try to modify it inside a loop, but you accidentally misnamed it inside the loop. Python just assumes you wanted a new variable and thinks it's fine
 MSmits: and you can even access this variable outside the loop
 reCurse: Yeah that's annoying
 MSmits: but then again c++ allows a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense either without giving errors. I know you can prevent a lot of that stuff with a better configured IDE, but just the same I prefer C# for this
 reCurse: Sure but I'm not talking about that
 reCurse: I'm talking about what would amount to a 6 lines loop in C++ that I would write without second thought
 reCurse: Results in an hour or two of digging numpy APIs to combine some weird calls together so it doesn't choke on big data
 MSmits: and this would be hard in python?
 MSmits: ohh big data
 MSmits: well not all loops require a huge amount of data ofc
 reCurse: Ironically became the de facto language to handle big data
 MSmits: because of numpy i suppose
 MSmits: I guess this is what happens when people get too comfortable with a language
 MSmits: especially when they are not coders as a first profession. They're just glad they know 1 language well&#160;:)
 reCurse: Yeah yeah I know the song
 reCurse: Just ranting
 MSmits: hehe that's fine
 struct: JLukeSkywalker I tried the puzzle and got the normal 50xp
 Innoble: hmm i think the fact that i have a better solver is hurting me now :P
 Innoble: damnit talking on my alt again
 reCurse: Isn't your problem solved now?
 MSmits: I often solve around ply 31-33 in uttt now and I think that when I loss, I don't play optimally
 MSmits: yeah i just have it on because i was still running a cg bench on the alt
 MSmits: i wont start it up tomorrow
 reCurse: Are you... using that browser plugin to do bench
 MSmits: nah, i just paste my cg bench replays into the firefox browser thats logged in to my other account
 reCurse: Oh ok, gotcha
 struct: does that plugin still work?
 reCurse: Not sure, could be
 MSmits: I wonder if I should stop playing most visited move with the solved losses and instead play most valued move
 reCurse: You should definitely stop playing and do clobber instead
 MSmits: lol, probably right
 struct: MSmits you need to learn NN before next winter
 reCurse: Wait I thought chat was off in CG replays
 MSmits: because of heating?
 struct: yes
 Valdez001: Hello guy
 MSmits: it's off reCurse, stop trying to make sense of my stupidity, i just changed tab to my IDE in firefox that is also on my other account
 MSmits: instead of changing browser
 MSmits: this account is on chrome
 reCurse: I have trouble killing background threads
 RockNTroll: murderer
 MSmits: ye so do I
 MSmits: hey, just one more uttt question. When you were testing your NN, did you notice most of your versions losing to karliso?
 MSmits: because all my versions are much much weaker against karliso than your nn
 MSmits: and i tried a lot of different ones
 MSmits: it's usually between 40-55% vs your bot and then between 15-35% vs karliso
 reCurse: What did I do to deserve this
 reCurse: Oh wait, nevermind
 reCurse: There's a lot to answer for
 MSmits: i wont submit a bot that beats you by 55% and then loses to tomatoes 40% and karliso 20%
 MSmits: that would just leave me in the same spot and pull you down
 MSmits: I think it might be RPS again
 MSmits: never knew uttt had so much of that
 MSmits: but my new bot is very deterministic and so are your NN, so i guess it's that
 MSmits: anyway sorry, this is has just been weirding me out. I thought uttt was mostly randomish and a bot that's better, is generally better than everyone that's worse... but apparently not
 reCurse: But you knew the answer all along
 reCurse: It's just a variant of counterbooking
 MSmits: well isn't your NN then as well?
 MSmits: if you try different versions?
 MSmits: and you keep the one that is properly RPS-ed
 reCurse: Deterministic bots in fixed starts exhibit RPS to some extent
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: that is what i meant
 MSmits: my current bot has just 2 parameters really
 MSmits: it's not like i fitted them to find a counter to you
 reCurse: So not much difference except if you shake things up you still have a working bot
 reCurse: If you shake things up your counterbook is garbage
 MSmits: right
 reCurse: Like I mentioned the other day, the irony is the only way to fix this is have a generic book
 reCurse: And it's stupidity I'd rather not get into
 MSmits: generic isnt'much work aside from turning on the machine. But i guess your machine is doing other stuff
 MSmits: it's the counterbooking that's a lot of work
 reCurse: I completely disagree
 MSmits: why do you think a generic book is much work?
 reCurse: Why do you think counterbooking needs work?
 MSmits: no, I guess if you download replays automatically and process them it's not much more work than a generic book,, but it's still more work
 MSmits: generic doesnt require the extra work of gathering information from opponents and processing them
 struct: Even less work if you automate it
 reCurse: You literally only need to find the series of hardcoded moves that wins
 reCurse: That's a no brainer
 MSmits: so it's less time calculating for the machine
 MSmits: it's not less time coding
 reCurse: Generic opening needs you to actually find them and evaluate them correclty
 MSmits: mmh countering specific players also still needs some guidance, the same kind of guidance that it requires to do general openings
 MSmits: you need to know what good moves are in both cases
 MSmits: you just reduce the tree complexity when you counter specific players
 MSmits: basically halving the depth
 reCurse: You don't need good moves
 reCurse: You only need to find what the opponent doesn't respond well too
 reCurse: You can even get started by having the bot play against itself
 MSmits: that might work in the short term
 reCurse: There's nothing long term about counterbooking
 MSmits: if you want to win a book war, you want the counters to be as perfect as possible
 struct: also cant one move win vs a player but lose vs another?
 struct: Or you will just try other move?
 reCurse: If you want to win a book war, you need to come up with a generic opening book and vary it enough that hardcoding becomes way too difficult
 reCurse: It's pretty obvious comparing the amount of work
 MSmits: when karliso still had a book, at some point i solved his play from ply 25 and on and he kept deepening his book, but i already countered it all, because it was solved in my meta mcts
 MSmits: it was already playing perfectly
 reCurse: I don't know how you can argue that finding moves the opponent doesn't play well against is more work than finding moves working well in all situations
 MSmits: more coding work
 MSmits: not more time
 MSmits: it can be done really quickly
 MSmits: i did it to you in a day, by hand
 MSmits: but to code a system to do it automatically, using replays, is time consuming
 MSmits: it would be difficult for me
 struct: Is it more time consuming on the long term?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: if you have a system, you can reuse it
 MSmits: for other games
 MSmits: but  i had a generic opening book generator before i could add manual guidance and such
 reCurse: I have done both, meta mcts was more work
 MSmits: ah but there's the difference, the same mcts i use for generic moves simply has a button for guided search for countering players
 MSmits: its the same program
 reCurse: You don't need meta mcts to counter
 reCurse: Talk about overkill
 MSmits: you do if you want your book to do both
 reCurse: I never talked about doing both
 reCurse: I compare the work to counterbook vs. the work to have a generic book
 MSmits: ohh ok. I would never think of doign a book jjust to counter players. I like creating generic books. The counter thing came later, when i figured out that I could do that
 reCurse: Literally all you need to do is to record the different moves your bot plays when you give it 10x more thinking time
 reCurse: It's braindead
 MSmits: just counterbooking seems a timewaster, as you say people will just get a different version
 MSmits: my "counterbooks" are basiclaly just 100-200 moves put on top of a 2000 move generic book that's in a bot that has room for 100k moves
 reCurse: Well some people enjoy wasting their time
 reCurse: If you automate it well enough it's technically unbeatable
 MSmits: ah ok yeah. My main point was that such an automated system would seem hard to interface with my meta mcts program
 reCurse: But you don't need meta that's what I'm saying
 MSmits: yeah, i got that
 MSmits: I just would dislike your way of counterbooking. My way of counterbooking would just merge with the rest of the generic book and the moves would be generally good and be reusable vs other players. the parts of the tree explored would be persistent
 reCurse: There's no difference though
 reCurse: It's just going much deeper in fewer lines
 MSmits: yeah, but it's building on the generic book that maybe goes to ply 10-20 depending on the game
 struct: But you have a counterbook on top of it right?
 reCurse: With enough opponents you wouldn't tell the difference
 MSmits:  I guess so, but for some games, like Othello, countering one player also counters others
 reCurse: You just thought I had a huge opening book back then
 MSmits: there are too few "best" lines of play
 MSmits: in uttt yes, i did
 MSmits: in uttt, there are many viable lines of play as opposed to Othello
 reCurse: I am thoroughly unconvinced
 MSmits: well, to counter your nn i needed to add maybe 1 or 2 moves per line of play on top of the moves i already had vs jacek, oldjohn etc. you had several lines of play, maybe 15 or so unique ones, so i added 30 moves or so
 MSmits: most of the time my book was already 25-30 deep vs you
 MSmits: i just extended it to 40 or so when necessary
 MSmits: or 35
 MSmits: so my point is, your bot was not that different from say dbdr or others
 MSmits: played most of the same openingd
 reCurse: Aren't most bots sort of playing the same in utt
 MSmits: no, for p1 the teccles is pretty standard, but till ply 20 player 2 has to make about 10 decisions, those are completely different for everyone
 karliso: "solved his play from ply 25 and on and he kept deepening his book" - I did that only to make a point.
 MSmits: i know karliso
 karliso: Also, I will submit a bot that does 1st 2 moves as black as random.
 MSmits: i was making the point that counteribooking with mcts is more effective
 karliso: You will be able to test that.
 MSmits: karliso that's a great idea, but i wont be trying to counterbook anymore. So dont do that on my account
 MSmits: just do what makes your bot good
 karliso: No, I do it to test my bot.. just like you do.
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: good then
 MSmits: reCurse i should add, even though players play the early game very differently, the best players do play it deterministically differently with only few variations. 
 MSmits: so their game is deterministic but different from others
 MSmits: feature of the pruning that happens in the bot I guess
 MSmits: karliso's current bot has a only few variations and I don't even have to try to know yours probably always does the same
 MSmits: which is why i think it's cool to randomize the opening a bit more karliso
 reCurse: Hmm ok I changed my mind
 MSmits: oh hey, did i mention my new bot has no random 
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: (no random rollout_
 MSmits: it's eval
 MSmits: like your NN, except i has 2 eval parameters instead of 20k or whatever
 reCurse: Will it be enough to get ahead of the rest?
 reCurse: I'd be impressed
 MSmits: it's hard to say currently, i still have many untried ideas. But I have versions that are about 55% against everyone but tomatoes and karliso
 MSmits: that includes your NN
 MSmits: it would rank the same as my current bot i think
 MSmits: but as i said i wont submit, it would just pull you down
 reCurse: Well you'll submit at some point
 MSmits: yeah but i want it to be more gneeric
 MSmits: the determinism leads to weird situations
 MSmits: sometimes 70% vs yurko, 30% Mealc
 MSmits: stuff like that
 MSmits: with the random rollout that never happened
 MSmits: for some reason it always does well vs you though, even with different parameters, usually 40-55%
 MSmits: which i think is great vs such a good opponent
 MSmits: I think your bot has maybe some problems with the endgame, like it did in othello 
 reCurse: I added a solver and it did worse, go figure
 MSmits: my bot solves 20-15 plies before the end, sometimes it says i lose vs you, until 5 plies before the end and then your bot ruins it
 MSmits: and i draw
 reCurse: I literally can't solve that far ahead so
 reCurse: Of course it's bound to be weaker in the endgame
 MSmits: no i know, its the number iterations
 reCurse: The point is to not get in a weak endgame
 MSmits: that makes it a rather interesting matchup
 MSmits: between NN and non-NN
 MSmits: both having advantages
 reCurse: Well there goes my good mood, guess I'll start backporting
 Innoble: no need reCurse, even if you backport, there's always someone working on uttt, just wait until it actually loses
 Innoble: damnit, not again
 MSmits: karliso and I are both working on it now
 MSmits: we will stop eventually
 MSmits: maybe that's a better time to do it
 reCurse: You're assuming I won't stop before you do
 MSmits: i am sayin that if you get it done and i keep working and do something, you'll be annoyed about it again and maybe want to do more
 MSmits: then you'll have uttt 2 times in your future
 MSmits: instead of 1
 MSmits: just trying to minimize your uttt-time
 reCurse: You're assuming that time somehow gets more efficient if I wait
 reCurse: That's only true if someone leaks valuable info
 MSmits: I will leak probably
 MSmits: not sure if it's valuable
 MSmits: most of what i found these last few weeks are pruning opportunities and eval
 MSmits: migth not be useful for a nn
 MSmits: there's a crazy amount of domain knowledge in my bot now. I really want to write it up sometime and share
 MSmits: it might actually be read, because uttt is quite popular
 MSmits: maybe when i am done with this iteration
 karliso: So you say tomatoes sometimes does better than reCurse? For all my versions reCurse is strongest opponent and tomatoes are among "rest".
 karliso: Tomatoes goes all in with white.
 karliso: tomatoes    GW=62,90%    [ W=61,29%   L=35,48%   D=3,23%   ] [31]
 Innoble: oh not with me
 MSmits: that makes sense
 MSmits: your bot is definitely stronger than tomatoes
 MSmits: this version has a bug, but it shows my point:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3ee77bf5-f679-4e5a-9c24-1c59050e6bcd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3ee77bf5-f679-4e5a-9c24-1c59050e6bcd</a>
 MSmits: do you see how tomatoes is stronger and you are even stronger than that
 MSmits: bit low on games, but all my tests are like this
 MSmits: same result, usualyl a bit better for me (50% overall)
 MSmits: but this version has a bug i am trying to track eown
 MSmits: down
 MSmits: I think it's like recurse said and the difference might be the solving power my current bot has
 MSmits: that somehow helps me more vs recurse
 MSmits: since the other bots all solve better in the endgame
 karliso: Yes, reCurse's bott seems strong early/mid game.
 MSmits: yeah
 karliso: But I probably solve better than you.
 MSmits: my current bot probably solves better than yours, but it solves as a loss :Pp
 MSmits: my new bot solves at ply 29-34 often 20 before the end
 MSmits: I doubt your bot does that, but it does not need to, to win
 karliso: I don't "solve" actually... I just assume that if it is 80% it has found WIN.
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: when i say solve, I mena a proven win/loss/draw based on perfect play of both sides
 karliso: nice
 Innoble: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/528882570">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/528882570</a>
 Innoble: my bot playing itself
 Innoble: (my alt)
 Innoble: see how it knows it's won/lost at ply 31
 reCurse: The only way to solve my endgame (pun intended) is to know when a game is solvable, but unlike othello that seems next to impossible to predict in uttt
 Innoble: yeah, thats right, games have many different lengths
 MSmits: it depends on how many moves are played in a finished miniboard
 MSmits: also games are easily solvable when one side has 2 in a row and a good position in the 3rd board, then it becomes a matter of avoiding being forced to send the opponent there
 MSmits: that reduces branching a lot
 reCurse: That's an awful lot of domain knowledge I'd rather avoid
 MSmits: yeah as i said, i've been coding this sort of thing in my bot for the last week or so
 MSmits: lots of domain knowledge
 MSmits: if you dislike the game I can see why that would not be fun to do
 reCurse: uttt is the last game I get into I don't like playing
 struct: just wait until I port hex version of uttt
 MSmits: I think it's a bit sad you dont like some (or most?) of the boardgames you're writign NN's for reCurse
 MSmits: it would be more fun if you did
 MSmits: and more interesting
 struct: He enjoyed checkers right?
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: except for the draws
 reCurse: That's because I like the ML part
 reCurse: And yeah checkers is good
 reCurse: Draw is often because you suck at endgame, there's ways to deal with that
 MSmits: yes, i know thats what you like about it. But how much more fun would it be if you were into a boardgame, knew what good moves are and have enough domain knowledge to appeciate how well your bot is playing
 MSmits: thats what  i enjoy about watching your NN's, yours, robo's jacek etc.
 MSmits: i get to know these games and then see your bots' do great at them
 reCurse: That's probably why the day I start chess is the day I never get out
 MSmits: ah right, because thats a game you do like
 reCurse: It has its drawbacks
 daGio314: hmm
 Wontonimo: mmmmmhg

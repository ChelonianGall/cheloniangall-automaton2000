 midomawk: Hey, juste a question, which level consider to be good at coding in codingame
 IplayerLG: Hi every one)
 TheForgottenDidgeridoo_5d6e: Hi there
 jacek: good morning
 doduyphuong: :grinning:
 gsomix: Good morning jacek
 Romil: will I be considered as good programmer if I managed to reach silver league in some game...??
 Romil: as a 2nd year BTech Student..?  
 ErebosTheos: yes you are gonna be a best programmer.
 ErebosTheos: nobody from bronze and others can beat you now. Congratulation brother.
 norensaiga: yes romil you are awesome, you are way above others  soon you will reach legend too
 Romil: Uhhh... I didn't achieved this..  But I think I can do it in 10-12 days..
 Romil: ...sorry to say this.. But, are you serious/sure  ?? :no_mouth:
 jacek: if you did it yourself, its good
 jacek: as in, no copy/paste exact solution 
 Romil: oh yeah.. I gonna do it without copy paste and without importing some modules to make thing easier..  :upside_down:
 DmcPhuc: nnonononononono
 jacek: python? you can use modules if there are there
 Uljahn: somebody said in comments to my puzzle solution that using imports in python is cheating :smiley:
 jrke: then how he solved the puzzle :smiley:
 jacek: on a bright side, my breakthrough bot on littlegolem won its first game. well not yet, but its proved a win and its pending when other side will make move or resign
 jacek: :tada:
 Muin: Hi guys
 Muin: How do I find my solved problems history?
 jacek: clash or puzzles
 Muin: puzzles I think
 Muin: actually I'm new to this site. registered yesterday
 Muin: It was a "text alignment" problem
 Uljahn: Muin: try to paste it in the CG search
 jacek: in practice -&gt; puzzles, completed puzzles are grouped
 RobkePila: uztilk
 Joris_Serva: nespamink

 shashwat986: Is there anyone who's interested in trying a private Reverse-mode Clash?
 shashwat986: I'm creating a puzzle, and I want to see what "Reverse mode" looks like

 jrke: what is chain power in smash the code
 jrke: the no. of chanes cleared?
 jrke: chains*
 Uljahn: it's in the expert rules
 Uljahn: 0, 8, 16, 32 etc. depending on a step
 Ahriana: \clear
 Ahriana: how to close this area
 Ahriana: i didnt see it before
 Fandrew: \clear
 jacek: triangle at the bottom
 kwer: Hi every one
 GoogleJeff: Hi kwer!
 jacek: so many newcomers *.*
 Illedan: HI
 BitThief: Is anyone else getting a captcha before every clash?
 Illedan: Happens after a lot of clashes
 Illedan: to everyone
 Illedan: to prevent  bots
 Ahriana: yes, but after refresh page , this area show again
 ProCoder3: How to Activate Shield in CSB
 ProCoder3:&#160;???
 Uljahn: similar to BOOST by using SHIELD command in the output
 ProCoder3: so the output should be x , y,Shield instead of  regular x,y,Thrust 
 ProCoder3: am i right&#160;??
 Uljahn: ye
 ProCoder3: okay thanks:slight_smile:
 Uljahn: SHIELD is a just string that shoud be printed instead of thrust
 Uljahn: *is just a
 harslantrk: +
 Queuebee: Does anyone know if over-steering helps to steer faster in CSB? As in, putting the target coordinate next to the actual target, so that the angle-to-be-steered is slightly higher?
 Scarfield: it does, targetPos = CP - 3v
 gbzhou: Does anyone know why solutions to some puzzles are locked? Thanks
 Nanosplitter: My guess is because you haven't completed those puzzles yet gbzhou
 Scarfield: you can only see solutions for puzzles you have solved, and only in the same lang
 Uljahn: also some puzzles (like ANEO) are actually sponsored so sharing solutions is unavailable
 gbzhou: thanks
 Chapo: Hello, I am trying to solve Coders strike back and I am currently on Wood 2 league. I am getting "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 Chapo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5982584c-153f-4ee1-8883-75e8b0bf320a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5982584c-153f-4ee1-8883-75e8b0bf320a</a>
 Chapo: Does anyone know what is wrong? My console.log is outputting x and y coordinates as NaN
 SpaghettiCode: hello world
 Uljahn: hi, Chapocopy your code elsewhere and click "Restore default code" button on the top right of ide
 Chapo: Okay thanks Uljahn!
 Alshock: Hello guys, in CvZ I have a weird error in my sim: if I rush the zombie in the first test case, I end up at turn 9 with Ash(x=6408, y=4667), H(x=8250, y=4500), Z(x=8250, y=5399). But dist(Ash, Z) = 1982.11705. So why is it still alive?
 Alshock: According to description: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f904202-1b0d-4fd3-818c-63ccf344e471">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f904202-1b0d-4fd3-818c-63ccf344e471</a>
 Illedan: Maybe the distance during the movement is closer?
 Alshock: that was actually because I read the future z pos instead of its actual pos
 Alshock: sorry for that
 Schwase: you know just because i made a shit puzzle it doesnt mean people were given the right to shit all over me for it
 Schwase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5454c15299f9f3e381a42e11426874475df2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5454c15299f9f3e381a42e11426874475df2</a>
 Astrobytes: Schwase: no need to make it private, puzzles get downvoted all the time. Leave it up, take some suggestions on board and keep working on it (community effort and all that)
 Astrobytes: Don't let a few downvotes stand in the way of your puzzle
 Hjax: if i was struct i wouldnt have an account right now 
 Hjax: seeing how i didnt get legend last night
 Astrobytes: Ah still plugging away at gold eh
 Scarfield: wasnt first sumbit was it?
 Astrobytes: Any closer?
 Hjax: i actually lost ranks, even when i submit the same code im barely top 20 now
 Hjax: unlucky i guess
 Hjax: the issue is my bot has a 60% chance of beating pretty much anyone 
 Astrobytes: That happens with this game
 Hjax: so if i roll the 40% against weak players, i dont rank high
 Hjax: if i roll the 60% against the good players, i get a good rank
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you need a solid improvement to break through
 Hjax: i really see almost no trend between the rank of the players i play against and my performance 
 Hjax: sometimes i just get dead last by like 80 rounds 
 Hjax: against mid gold people
 Hjax: sometimes i smash the boss
 Astrobytes: I've not had a chance to do anything, helping to clear my grandfathers house. 
 Astrobytes: Not very effectively cause of my back but helping nonetheless
 Hjax: im currently in my "change parameters randomly instead of adding features" trap
 Hjax: i really should stop doing this
 Astrobytes: Ah. Yeah, that phase. Leave it a while and do some thinking
 Astrobytes: Are you doing any sims/prediction?
 Hjax: nope
 Hjax: for square in around(my_position): pick maximum(heuristic(square))
 Astrobytes: Might be worth adding some, maybe no need for a full search, just simulating a few things
 Hjax: my entire algo pseudocode ^
 Astrobytes: Mines is something like that too
 Hjax: i need to be able to predict slashers with 100% accuracy at least
 Hjax: i started writing something for that last night but i didnt like it and deleted it 
 Hjax: ill try again later 
 Astrobytes: Shouldn't take you too long to implement wanderers and slashers
 TheForgottenDidgeridoo_5d6e: Hjax which one are you trying?
 Hjax: code of kutulu
 Hjax: theres some things about slasher behavior i dont really understand 
 Hjax: i should probably read the ref 
 Hjax: the way the game exposes their state to you is kind of weird 
 Scarfield: like what, have just done a targetting function, and seems like it works
 Hjax: so if they target an explorer, and the explorer walks out of range 
 Hjax: is their target still the explorer? or is it -1?
 Hjax: and i still have to remember the last seen square from the slashers perspective to know where its going to dash 
 Scarfield: actually not sure what you get as input, but they remember the last position and rushes to it when stalking counter is +
 Scarfield: 0 *
 Scarfield: last seen position that is*, in LOS
 Mathkute: I am porting to C my Java code but it times out when reading the input: any advice on how to get help on this?
 Hjax: the inputs for slashers are: targeted ID, state machine state, and timer until next state
 Hjax: so i have to track targeted square myself 
 Scarfield: yes
 Hjax: i see the slasher in the RUSH state before it rushes right?
 Hjax: RUSH state means its going to rush as soon as all of the explorers move once more
 Hjax: why didnt they call the multi code of cthulhu
 Hjax: Cthulhu is in the public domain 
 Scarfield: hmm its a little weird with the state, you get 3 as input the turn it rushes (after player moves as you say), but it says "stunned" when you hover the mouse over it in the viewer
 Hjax: its kind of hard to avoid a slasher that is targeting an explorer, because i dont know where the explorer is going to move
 Hjax: unless you can escape LOS
 Hjax: i can predict that they will move away from the slasher i guess 
 Scarfield: it says "rush" the turn before it actually rushes when hovering with mouse in viewer, but the input state is 2 for stalking
 Hjax: and either stay still or move towards the slasher
 Hjax: im surprised the people doing antagonistic minimax have any sort of depth
 Hjax: between the 3 other explorers there can be up to 125 legal moves per depth 
 Hjax: thats not a very kind branching factor 
 Hjax: which is why ill probably optimize against my heuristic bot
 Hjax: but then my search might make mistakes if my heuristic bot is dumb 
 Hjax: once in a coding competition i saw someone grab a bunch of decent open source bots and optimize against all of them simultaneously 
 Scarfield: there is also (up to) the 3 effects, if all players have them remaining. I will probably try SmitisiMax for this, when i get the sim to work
 Hjax: yeah smitsimax seems very sane for this game 
 Hjax: because it doesnt assume everyone hates you 
 Scarfield: xD
 Hjax: it just assumes everyone is self interested, which they are
 Scarfield: yea its a weird mix of coop and competive play, pretty cool idea
 Hjax: if i get around to writing a search i probably wont use smitsimax
 Hjax: ill probably just optimize against my heuristic
 Hjax: even though i think its inferior to smitsimax here
 Lisker_the_slow: is python good for bot programming&#160;?
 Scarfield: sure, just not if you want to something with a lot of computations, like a search with simulation
 jacek: well he is Lisker_the_slow after all
 Lisker_the_slow: lol
 Hjax: yeah it really depends on the game 
 Hjax: some games you can get rank 1 with python, some youd be lucky to get gold (looking at you UTTT)
 xzxy: in coc, the first person who chooses  to launch clash shouldnt be able to leave after launching it @admin
 dbf: hi, for code vs zombies I have 130k or 180k score for the same code when re-submit. Is it something like different servers that are running my solution?
 eulerscheZahl: is your solution randomized?
 eulerscheZahl: CG has different servers. But iirc they only use one type for optim
 yadon: I can't understand.
 eulerscheZahl: they even made a full rerun of all players when they switched servers
 dbf: it has it has some random with fixed seed. a bit strange that it is mostly 130 or 180, not something between
 eulerscheZahl: well, you have that awesome improvement somewhere close to the time limit i guess
 eulerscheZahl: also: i guess you do something likewhile (time) tryRandomPlan()
 eulerscheZahl: and your seed for later turns will depend on the number of simulations you can perform in the first turn - which is random
 eulerscheZahl: also: any ETA for the next RAIC contest yet?
 dbf: lol, no they mentioned that raic, min-raic and higloadcup should be sometime this year, but no final dates yet
 dbf: and they should also send t-shirts soon
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, they asked me to enter my shipping address last week
 dbf: cool
 dbf: have you registered for yandex.cup?
 eulerscheZahl: i miss the optim track, i'm not that into algos&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and that's the only part open to everyone
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm registered for the reply security challenge in october
 dbf: yep, I'll try backend contest but looks like it is for russia only because it is mostly for hiring
 eulerscheZahl: and no more 512 tshirts
 eulerscheZahl: russian code cup dead as well
 dbf: I've read that they have an idea to reduce number of t-shirts in raic because a lot of people don't collect them and packages are returned :_
 eulerscheZahl: those monsters!
 dbf: lol, hope they will not cut prizes this year because of budget cuts like in some other contests&#160;:)
 YurkovAS: dbf in optimizations 3 distinct CPUs Intel Haswell 2.2, 2.4, 3.0 GHz
 Matt_ttaM: cjchkc
 Bassel: Sup
 Ryanless: if i want/need to write a visual debug tool similar to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/</a>  what would be the easiest way to do so? also consindering that my GeneticAlgorithm is in c#
 Bassel: Check processing lib if you can use javascript
 irishcoder: @DiL Can you share your code more often I come to this website to practice my programming :pensive:
 TheSpiffiest: Anyone know when MadKnight comes on?
 Hjax: hes russian, so its somewhat late there for him right now 
 LoukasPap: hello hjax again
 LoukasPap: are those participants always inside coding gmae?
 LoukasPap: and they are moderators i see
 Uljahn: moderators never sleep&#160;:(
 LoukasPap: and, are aall these participants, the only ones online?
 LoukasPap: in entire coding game
 zPerinax: is it normal im struggling my ass off for "easy" puzzles&#160;?
 zPerinax: I feel so pathetic
 Bobbadillio: I'd say it REALLY depends on your background! If you're struggling on easy puzzles, I'd guess that you're newer to coding, probably without a CS degree, or maybe in your first year.
 SPDene: also, some "easy" puzzles aren't that easy. I've seen some that are harder than the "hard" ones, so you might have just been unlucky which ones you chose
 Bobbadillio: A lot of the apparent "ease" will be related to how well you know CS algorithms too, and maybe even which ones you know specifically.
 Bobbadillio: Lots of people struggle more with one of iterative or recursive approaches to solving a problem
 Bobbadillio: There are a lot of tricks you learn through doing a lot of problems. I ask myself pretty much all the time, "how much easier would this problem be if I sorted something?"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: some of the newer easy puzzles are kinda classified a little low ... I've done 100% of the easy ones / 68% medium / 37% hard/ 16% very hard.  Pick and choose puzzles according to your comfort level.  Sometimes coming back to a puzzle later is a more effective use of time. g/l.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: example.  puzzle "is that a possible word" i did in 26 lines of code but I used an associative array instead of a basic linear one, to me it maybe should be medium instead...but it is what it is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and maybe "the electricians apprentice" I used multidimensional array and booleans
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok they left
 solution.cpp: Hello, world
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Anyone make a good run into Bender-Ep. 4? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20480 bytes) in the answer code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh, 10x10 testcases work fine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't get even one 20x20 to complete
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its not even recursive
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gheesh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, guess I just have to feed bot my own boards then and find the bugs.
 kasudy: hello
 kasudy: what are the strat for Slashers
 kasudy:&#160;?
 AnyaA:&#160;???
 kasudy: can you share some start to how to beat the slashers?
 AnyaA: what game?
 kasudy: kutulu
 AnyaA: oh...I can't really add on to what has alreday been said, it should be clear
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Just stay off of visible row/column
 kasudy: hmm that seens like a fair strat
 Benftwc: Hey
 Benftwc: Any hearthstone helps here&#160;?
 Benftwc: Can't even figure what I have to do there, can't read the pool to make a pick choose&#160;:(

 Zenoscave: struct only if it's empty?
 struct: I think so zeno
 Zenoscave: Does anyone have a good design pattern for generic MCTS? I hate recoding it for each game
 Zenoscave: but the templating types get convoluted for me
 Zenoscave: just like a TYpe interface or UML would be awesome...
 struct: I dont have any generic code for CG I think
 Severed: just an FYI: removing the lines that said to capture center square if available improved the outcome. constantly taking center square in the games basically handed the main center square to the opponent
 jacek: hm? well you shouldnt give center to your opponent easily
 Q12: Can I somehow reach my code in SOPRA STERIA CODING CHALLENGE and keep coding? 
 Q12: after the contest is over or because it is sort of a private one I can't?
 Carsonfanboy: u can copy it with strg c
 Carsonfanboy: before the contest stops
 Carsonfanboy: and than paste it in
 Q12: it has already been over, is there some other way?
 Carsonfanboy: i dont know that was just the first thing i thought about
 Carsonfanboy: sr&lt;
 Carsonfanboy: sry*
 TheSpiffiest:  grrr, frsutrating. Clash times were the same to the second, but I'm 2nd place. :P
 Carsonfanboy: uh that sux
 lopidav: TheSpiffiest show me the results page
 TheSpiffiest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1571467b91ef6b6cf4cbfa6186b75120f77c809">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1571467b91ef6b6cf4cbfa6186b75120f77c809</a>
 TheSpiffiest: It was probably just subsecond
 TheSpiffiest: I haven't seen how ties are resolved and I imagine at computer accuracy there isn't one.
 TheSpiffiest: It's more of a formatting issue I'm guessing
 lopidav: good result! DP Amar is 9th in clash rankings and you tied with him, pretty cool.
 lopidav: about formatting: I would recommend filling a bug report
 TheSpiffiest: Should I bother? I think it would be only if there is a tie display sub second accuracy
 TheSpiffiest: where do I submit bugreports?  In the feedback on the clash or elsewhere?
 TheSpiffiest: Also how can I see clash rankings?
 Mr.intro: you mean leaderboard&#160;?
 TheSpiffiest: Oh - I found it
 TheSpiffiest: I didn't know clicking on ranking gave you a breakdown of the various things making up the score
 lopidav: clash leaderboard is separate tho
 lopidav: and COOL BOIS™ like me use scripts to display clash rank on a codingamer card so we don't have to go to the ranking page all the time
 lopidav: wow, tm is so big
 lopidav: testing™℠©℗Ⓤ
 lopidav: ®
 lopidav: ok, so tm c r is big and black while everything else is normal. Is this a font thing?

 geriatric1927: dogecoin becoming stonks
 AntiSquid: went down and fluctuates at low levels only, not even worth a gamble right now (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE MEME DISCLAIMER)
 AntiSquid: oh 0.04 maybe now it goes somewhere ... w/e
 AntiSquid: nope nvm ... forgot 0.04 is the current upper limit
 UndisclosedSausage_f45: how best will you recommend investing in dogecoins now?
 jacek: thats question for reBless
 Rockstar555: hii
 Rockstar555: what discussion was going
 AntiSquid: i recommend to do your own research since it's probably your money you want to invest lol UndisclosedSausage_f45

 geriatric1927: Perl masterrace
 geriatric1927: Some person didn't remove an extra blank space in shortest
 geriatric1927: Pity&#160;:(
 geriatric1927: He had 11 bytes in perl, I barely knew anything about perl but I managed to square the number and print it to the shell 
 geriatric1927: And I removed the extra blank space which the person forgot to remove
 geriatric1927: Cheeky win&#160;:)
 Rocky[KGF]: hey 
 Rocky[KGF]: why u paste this here

 AntiSquid: how's it going kiwi
 KiwiTae: AntiSquid not bad&#160;:) getting used to my new job 
 Rocky[KGF]: nice
 Rocky[KGF]: i have a problem that i am better than boss but i am not getting to next league CSB
 jacek: so youre not better than other top players
 Rocky[KGF]: noo
 Rocky[KGF]: my rank is 1
 Rocky[KGF]: jacek
 jacek: you have less points than boss?
 jacek: i think the rank on the top doesnt include boss in leaderboard
 Uljahn: wait until your submit is at 100%, and even after that the promotion isn't instant, there should be a cooldown specified at the top of the league's leaderboard
 Rocky[KGF]: okk
 StepBack13: $GME?
 Rocky[KGF]: What is this StepBack13
 Rocky[KGF]: use english only
 StepBack13: GameStop, it's a stock that appears to have great $ potential
 jacek: oh my
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: yes GME after you do your research, then sure it's great
 AntiSquid: also buy the dip or wait for it, GME is at 300+ now, not very affordable

 ThePhantomCarpet_ce27: okay 
 DJMadKnight_6e63: because you are just next to me
 BlaiseEbuth: ThePhantomCarpet_ce27 you were just kicked
 AntiSquid: ya please english, feel free to chat random stuff, but please get an avatar (not a rule, but a polite request)
 ThePhantomCarpet_ce27:&#160;???
 DJMadKnight_6e63: flemme
 AntiSquid: kick means you can press F5 and rejoin chat
 AntiSquid: but watch your back
 DJMadKnight_6e63: oe mais moi la je suis méga banni
 BlaiseEbuth: Now yes
 AntiSquid: lol that nickname
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 Westicles: Did the cache in MKs brain finally break?
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't have banned ... you killed meme potential .
 BlaiseEbuth: isn't it a CG-Generated name&#160;?
 AntiSquid: what are the chances of that being a coincidence? the stars have aligned&#160;! 
 BlaiseEbuth: \o/
 AntiSquid: it was the second comming of mad knights and you banned him
 AntiSquid: you should feel bad .
 BlaiseEbuth: I prefer think I saved the humanity...
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 struct: Could they not add a minimum account time to be allowed to chat?
 BlaiseEbuth: There is one. A sort of. You can't see chat before lvl3. Or 2&#160;?
 struct: yeah but lvl doesnt really do a good job
 BlaiseEbuth: But it's pretty fast to reach...
 Scarfield: Also trolls can just copy paste code to reach that lvl, account age wouldnt hurt
 Westicles: The OG disapprove of the newcomers and their goals.  Isn't that the fundamental problem here lately?
 Uljahn: i guess the chat is accessible with an external client at any level
 struct: I dont have any problem against newcomers
 Scarfield: i dont think anyone disapproves newcomers, but trolls can be a problem
 struct: But do you think the "newcomers" you see in chat everyday trolling add anything to the site?
 Basisprime: Blaise pourquoi tu ma banni :sob:
 Scarfield: ^ the lvl issue and no account age right here sigh
 BlaiseEbuth: English here Basisprime
 Basisprime: sorry my bad 
 Basisprime: so why did you banned me&#160;?:sob:
 BlaiseEbuth: Should I really explain&#160;? :expressionless:
 Basisprime: yes i don't understand why 
 Uljahn: have you been given a warning?
 FalbertTheGnome: he's been banned from the french chat
 Uljahn: without warnings? for doing nothing abusive?
 FalbertTheGnome: he said a bad word 
 Westicles: All he wanted was to be social, talk about clashes, and explore job opportunities.  Poor guy
 Uljahn: understandable, have a nice day
 [CG]Thibaud: (and spammed the chat)
 reCurse: Always the same script, act like an idiot, then act all innocent and say what's wrong I did nothing bad forgive me. Must be the cheat code in school or something.
 reCurse: Then usually followed by the optional step of insults when you deny.
 Scarfield: Does anyone know what approaches have been used for the 960chess so far?
 reCurse: According to tric track's record (hehe), probably some advanced minimax bot
 Scarfield: rgr, cant really decide if i should try MCTS, EPT or minimax first, but nice contribution&#160;:)
 Ornitro: Hi everyone, I have a problem with the last test of the first (easy) Chuck Norris Game&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03aa074f-37f6-4b0f-a5bd-137e9d24c625">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03aa074f-37f6-4b0f-a5bd-137e9d24c625</a>
 reCurse: Thanks
 reCurse: Minimax has been the cornerstone of chess AI for decades you'll find a huge amount of information
 reCurse: MCTS will be challenging to deal with shallow traps, it's been completely neglected in chess until alphazero came along
 kovi: i will try...mcts (what a surprise)
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: yea, but i usually go into a problem blind, then look into what others have done, and why its better to do that xD
 reCurse: Search exhaustiveness is a nice property in chess
 reCurse: Even in checkers I still have to sometimes deal with mcts being blind to obvious tactics, so I can only imagine in chess...
 Scarfield: that is why im thinking of doing EPT, at least it should be less blind i assume
 reCurse: I say mcts but it's actually anything best-first
 struct: Well, I think you must do ept
 struct: No way it will be good with normal mcts
 struct: Will be almost as good as random
 struct: on chess
 struct: at least with cg constraints
 reCurse: Having a best-first not missing any shallow tactics is hard
 Scarfield: i will just eval my queen with a low score, and find all the queen sacrifices :p
 reCurse: Naturally
 Scarfield: btw, its only the very first turn that has 1000ms right? not the first turn of 2nd game as well
 struct: Only first turn, before last print where you choose settings
 struct: So no player gets an advantage
 kovi: oh, wait. before chess let me escape!
 Scarfield: ok ty
 reCurse: Yeah you can't use the first second to precompute anything specific to the game, would make pairing difficult
 kovi: hmm
 Scarfield: ooh, i was just intending to reuse my tree with "flipped" players. I missed that, even though you said it pretty clearly xD
 kovi: metagame of what to precompute for white to ensure win, black to keep draw, or both
 kovi: anyway...no escape for nowinstead im redoing bt. now the improved mcts (+solver) works ok (top20). time to add heuristics
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 AntiSquid: i don't understand how pre-computing stuff on first turn leads to an unfair advantage, both sides can do it no?
 owent3877: hello im back
 jacek: making bot for chess and people are thinking about mcts...
 jacek: 5 years ago there was no other option for chess
 Angecide: no other option than mcts?
 jacek: than minimax
 hpa: why though? wasn't it well known then?
 jacek: it was, but pure mcts does poorly in chess-like games with many traps
 jacek: it was like this: minimax for chess, mcts for go/hex/havannah
 linjoehan: yeah MCTS in chess does poorly mainly because in many cases there are 30 possible moves but only one really makes sense
 linjoehan: maybe MCTS will work if you direct the random rollouts
 linjoehan: has anyone tried the excape missions yet?
 Katespizer: what's the name of this problem? "from string s you can remove none, any or all of the letters, the order of letters have to be preserved. Output all possible strings" I've seen problem like this like 3 times, how it's called? or what to seek for
 TheUNkilled: I also have a weird bug
 TheUNkilled: On my local IDE the program works normally
 TheUNkilled: But here it throws an index string out of range?
 TheUNkilled: Even if i manually checked with print and it's not out of range???

 MSmits: what update?
 struct: new cg feature I think
 MSmits: mysterious
 DomiKo: there are news&#160;;)
 struct: where?
 kovi: mail
 struct: oh I didnt check
 kovi: no escape...
 kovi: or is there?

 jacek: oh, new puzzle of the week
 DomiKo: small group got info
 jacek: a puzzle :unuamused:

 BlaiseEbuth: Elitism I say&#160;!
 MSmits: who is small group?
 struct: 5% of the 5%?
 BlaiseEbuth: Not me and it's not acceptable&#160;!
 MSmits: you're not small enough BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: Didn't get anything. Was wondering what the references to 'escapes' were earlier
 struct: ^
 BlaiseEbuth: Are you saying I'm fat&#160;? :rage:
 MSmits: nahhh
 Astrobytes: Maybe it's 5% of the 95%
 MSmits: i was saying you're tall, like a basketball player
 jacek: "just prepared for winter"
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh&#160;! :flushed:
 BlaiseEbuth: A group of totally randomly-choose players (But who will not criticize too hard) :3
 jacek: no escaping then
 struct: from the title it seems like an ARG puzzle
 jacek: argh
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 Astrobytes: Well, guess we'll see it when we see it.
 Astrobytes: Or not, if it gets a negative response I suppose.
 BlaiseEbuth: As if the community's opinion have any importance... :smirk:
 Astrobytes: Do I detect a hint of salt... :thinking:
 MSmits: oh so it was supposed to be a secret playtest  and it got leaked immediately?
 Astrobytes: No, it got emailed to some people and they asked about it in chat.
 Astrobytes: Well, 2 or 3 of them at least
 Astrobytes: And T said on discord to perhaps expect something on Monday about it
 MSmits: ah
 jacek: which monday
 BlaiseEbuth: Tibo said on discord that "you will have some news" today. But it seems we're not all included in the "you"
 Astrobytes: "You might hear more about it starting next Monday&#160;!"
 Astrobytes: so *starting
 struct: monday is still not over
 BlaiseEbuth: But only a little group of you
 Astrobytes: But perhaps it's a phased thing
 MSmits: or a moebius thing
 Astrobytes: Starting today
 Astrobytes: lol
 darkhorse64: In plain English, "might" denote something unlikely

 therealbeef: anyone else got that email about coding escape?
 TBali: #metoo
 therealbeef: tried it yet?
 jacek: oO
 TBali: only the tutorial - invited some coop players, but it takes time to find the time
 struct:&#160;:(
 therealbeef: was a bit afraid of that too
 therealbeef: you have to play at the same time as the others?
 TBali: it seems so. wouldn't work the idea otherwise
 reCurse: So what is it
 TBali: not sure I am allowed to reveal. It seems like a closed beta. But happy to invite you in DM
 TBali: asked for feedback, might need polish, etc.  and only 2 games revealed yet out of several
 jacek: need polish? here i am
 TBali:&#160;:)
 TBali: And I thought jokes about Hungarians being hungry is lame... _)
 TBali:&#160;:)
 Westicles: Is it XP or CP?
 jacek: you should invade Turkey then
 TBali: Idea is interesting. But aimed NOT at hardcore competitive coders 
 reCurse: Well yeah no kidding
 reCurse: Starting to put the pieces together though
 Westicles: heh heh, the cranky old guys don't like team play?  who would have thought it :P
 reCurse: Rather ironic, more that I did too much of it
 therealbeef: it's not tied to codingame account at the moment; it needs a new account apparently
 reCurse: With strangers on internet
 reCurse: I'm entirely done with that
 TBali: it seems more like "coop with your real-life friends, calssmates, etc"
 TBali: no strangers
 TBali: no matchmaking
 TBali: I am allowed to invite &lt;20 more people. Some spot went to RL colleagues/friends. Happy to share the link in DM for some, if interested
 struct: you can invite people not in beta?
 TBali: yes
 struct: sure ill take it
 TBali: went
 Astrobytes: I'll be giving that a miss then.
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh. You will tell me.
 Westicles: If it gives XP, you all will do it.  You've been conditioned so
 struct: completed the tutorial too
 Astrobytes: Nope. I refuse to do the clash path on the quest map.
 struct: Not much to tell
 Astrobytes: What it is might be a reasonable start :P
 TBali: we have to try out one of the real games to see how it really goes 
 struct: sure TBali if you want create one and pm me the link
 Astrobytes: Cooperative solving? 
 TBali: Hey you were giving that a miss then.&#160;:-)
 TBali: Okay, struct and myself will have a trial run tommorrow 9PM CET.Happy to have few people to join. Min number of players 2, recommneded 3-5.Duration 60-90mins
 TBali: DM me if interested
 struct: the 60 minutes seems a bit high, but i dont know what to expect
 TBali: we will crack it in 30&#160;:-)
 struct: I was going for 15
 Astrobytes: I'll join casually
 Scarfield: I am interested, but not in the escape&#160;;)
 struct: astro we must get top 5%
 Westicles: stream it?
 TBali: Astrobytes, "do or do not, there is no try"
 Astrobytes: I will do it casually.
 Scarfield: AstroTries
 TBali: stream LOL so that you all laugh us
 BlaiseEbuth: And ScarFails
 Astrobytes: AstroChillsInTheChairAndJudgesSilently
 Scarfield: xD
 MaxTheorum: anyone got the link to the new thing? accidentaly deleted the mail
 BlaiseEbuth: fat chance
 Scarfield: riiight
 MaxTheorum: honestly, its a weird thing in mac big sur accidentaly deleted instantly gone
 MaxTheorum: already made an account
 MaxTheorum: or is there any way I could approach staff or anything?
 BlaiseEbuth: Discretly
 Westicles: I usually approach staff from the flank
 Astrobytes: No shit lol
 BlaiseEbuth: You drop from the roof
 jacek: nice rank in bt, kovi
 kovi: thx jacek
 kovi: probably it has more valid heuristics, i just started
 kovi: (more than uttt)
 kovi: hmm, how msmits is so low on bt?
 jacek: hes noob, thats why
 lopidav: Did Alice delete their account?
 lopidav: not allice wait
 Westicles: Allis, yep last week
 Astrobytes: Yeah, what was that about
 lopidav: How can I contact them? I have a script that they partly made and I want to publish it
 MetehanBayraktar: in c++ if I initialize two variable like this  --&gt;   int s{0};       first time I've seen  s{0}    what does it do&#160;? if anyone can help it , would be awesome
 MetehanBayraktar: one variable sorry
 therealbeef: s is initialized as 0
 Astrobytes: lopidav: not at all unless they're on the discord under the same name?
 therealbeef: same as auto s = int{0}; or just auto s{0};
 lopidav: Astrobytes, thanks for the idea. Doesn't look like this method works tho. 
 Westicles: You could ask on zapakh stream, maybe somebody on there knows him
 lopidav: there are also two other deleted account in CoC top 20.
 Westicles: Or velcoro, I think they were buddies
 MSmits: lol kovi, i suck at bt so far. I tried a mcts but it doesnt work very well
 MSmits: will get back to it eventually
 lopidav: Westicles it kinda feels like stalking. They probably have a reason for deletion
 Westicles: might not have been voluntary...
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, missclick happen
 lopidav: with two other deleted accounts looks like some drama took place here
 BlaiseEbuth: Or he just deleted all his accounts at the same time... :thinking:
 lopidav: eh, speculation is not fun when it's more like an accusation 
 jacek: nyoro~n
 MSmits: j'accuse!
 BlaiseEbuth: :grin:
 Westicles: that line is my intellectual property :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you his royalties to Zola&#160;?

 ZarthaxX: but im studying for a final exam, as i have 3 pending

 ZarthaxX: 4th year of official career, but i have done 4 years already
 ZarthaxX: the first one is just for entry

 Manchi_o6o7: if someone can explain this to me...
 ZarthaxX: what's that
 Manchi_o6o7: I need just the explanation of the output
 Manchi_o6o7: what is the sizeof( structure)
 struct: 16 bytes
 struct: A size of a pointer is 8 bytes though
 struct: You can just do sizeof(T)
 struct: to get size of the struct
 struct: sizeof(T*) = 8
 ZackGabri: are the test servers lagging or something? my tests are taking too long and returning status -1
 typingm: Having the same issue.
 struct: it fixes in 10-15 minutes
 struct: servers always have problems at this time
 struct: leaderboard update
 ZackGabri: oh ok then
 Vynom: time to go bed for me then xD
 Papaver: Ah! Thanks for the explanation&#160;:)
 Manchi_o6o7: how is the size of a structure calculated*
 Manchi_o6o7:&#160;?
 struct: its based on the data inside the structure
 Manchi_o6o7: here I have 2 chars
 struct: no
 struct: you have a char and a pointer
 Manchi_o6o7: aren't they the same size
 struct: a pointer is 8 bytes
 struct: a char is 1 byte
 Manchi_o6o7: really?
 struct: 1 + 8 = 16 bytes
 Manchi_o6o7: every pointer
 struct: because 7 bytes are padded
 struct: I think so
 Manchi_o6o7: the padding goes always to the exponent of 2?
 ZarthaxX: the padding makes the struct a multiple of biggest data
 ZarthaxX: u can avoid the padding
 ZarthaxX: putting some directive to the struct
 Manchi_o6o7: I need to write an exam, so I need to calculate it by brain
 struct: not sure if the exam requires to calculate padding
 ZarthaxX: lol
 struct: to you should check
 Manchi_o6o7: I think so
 struct: typedef struct t {char c;char d; int b; } T;typedef struct t {char c; int b; char d;} T;
 struct: are those the same size?
 ZarthaxX: the order may affect 
 struct: yeah
 struct: I wanted to explain him
 Manchi_o6o7: no, they are not
 struct: why not?
 Manchi_o6o7: I am trying to figure it out
 Manchi_o6o7: in the second example, padding is given from both sides
 Manchi_o6o7: so it becomes 4 4 4
 Manchi_o6o7: in the first it should be 1 4 4
 Manchi_o6o7: but it prints eight&#160;:/
 struct: first i.e: 1 byte -&gt; 1 byte -&gt; 2-&gt; padding -&gt; 4 bytes
 struct: first i.e: 1 byte -&gt; 1 byte -&gt; 2 padding -&gt; 4 bytes
 Manchi_o6o7: why is the padding 2?
 struct: ZarthaxX help
 Manchi_o6o7: sorry guys
 struct: ah wait I remember
 struct: So on 64 bit compiler
 struct: you can read up to 8 bytes
 struct: so it becomes
 ZarthaxX: what?
 struct: char a [1 byte] char b[1 byte] int d[4 bytes]
 struct: then you pad 2 at end
 struct: ok
 struct: im not explaining well
 struct: ZarthaxX explain this
 Manchi_o6o7: hahahahhahaha
 Manchi_o6o7: I am trying to figure it out
 Manchi_o6o7: it is confusing me

 ZarthaxX: i was gonna say just paste a link :P
 ZarthaxX: it's just some defined rule, nothing to understand
 struct: yeah I guess
 struct: and i worded it poorly
 struct: Manchi_o6o7 check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aROgtACPjjg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aROgtACPjjg</a>
 Angelburgie22: Anyone else feeling this thing laggy, or is it just my laptop?
 struct: not your laptop
 struct: is the site
 struct: should fix soon
 Manchi_o6o7: I will check the video 
 Angelburgie22: K, thx
 Daiim: It was the daily update
 Daiim: *save*
 Manchi_o6o7: I understood the padding thing
 Manchi_o6o7: but why the structure is 8 bytes, but the pointer to the structure 4 bytes...
 struct: Depends on the architecture
 struct: if the compiler is 32 bits then a pointer is 4 bytes
 Manchi_o6o7: 64 = 8 bytes
 struct: yes
 Manchi_o6o7: is it same for an int
 Manchi_o6o7: float etc.
 Manchi_o6o7: it is
 Manchi_o6o7: thank you very much
 struct: np
 Manchi_o6o7: ~!i if someone could explain this
 Manchi_o6o7: " ~! " bitwise not is understandable
 struct: 0 becomes 1 
 struct: 1 becomes 0
 Manchi_o6o7: but&#160;!&#160;?
 struct: the&#160;! operator?
 Manchi_o6o7: yes
 struct: return !false;
 struct: returns true
 struct: and return !true
 struct: returns false
 vesuwiusz:&#160;! is negation operator
 Manchi_o6o7: what does it return if I have  ~!number
 icecream17: !number
 Manchi_o6o7: what does it look for
 icecream17: what language is this
 struct: if number is 0
 Manchi_o6o7: C
 struct: it comes 1
 struct: else it becomes 0

 Manchi_o6o7: if I have the number 36, as an int
 icecream17: ~!0 becomes ~1 becomes 0
 alopikon: not of a number but the same sign(if it is signed number)
 struct: !36 = 0
 icecream17: ~! (not 0) become ~0 becomes 1
 Manchi_o6o7: what would it printf out
 icecream17: ~!0 becomes ~1 becomes 0~! (not 0) become ~0 becomes 1
 icecream17: ~! (not 0) = 1
 struct: ~! its two operators
 icecream17: that kinda reminds me of for (x = 10; x --&gt; 1;) // x goes to 1

 Manchi_o6o7: can someone explain me this behaviour...
 Manchi_o6o7: how is it at the end 130 ( 82 hex)
 Manchi_o6o7: and what happens with the signs

 eulerscheZahl: i don't know anything that doesn't get mentioned on chat. i'm not even on CG discord anymore
 Darleanow: yeah i know&#160;! i was just asking, as you've been here for quite a long&#160;!
 RandomSteve: I kinda wanted to try the java certification test (I would probably not pass it) but terms and conditions say I should only do it if invited by a recruiter, yikes idk
 Ayza: you don't need a recruiter
 Ayza: + If you can pass clashes with java, then you can probably pass the certification test
 Ayza: 5 puzzles, 1 hour
 BO3__bits: yo
 BO3__bits: mother father
 HafizurRahman: oi
 HafizurRahman: how to win level 4
 StevenV: what language is the most modern language supported by CG?
 eulerscheZahl: Kotlin i think
 eulerscheZahl: First appeared	July 22, 2011(from wikipedia)
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, swift is from 2014
 StevenV: thanks
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: happy Chaturday

 PatrickMcGinnisII: U think your house is yours... nope... your cat is the hoMEOWner
 Aldoggen: you're the pet, he owns you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: They are little murderers trapped in little bodies.&#160;;)
 Aldoggen: mosquitos are too, they just don't know it
 MSmits: they know it
 Aldoggen: until they go splat of course
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if cats could fly I would have more than 3.  If they could breathe fire, i would have a castle full of them.
 MSmits: If cats could fly they would escape 
 Aldoggen: I hope there's not much flammable stuff in your castle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a doggie door, they go in and out as they please.
 MSmits: isn't this a saying?
 MSmits: if wishes were wings, cats would roast your furniture?
 MSmits: or something like that
 Aldoggen: pigs would fly
 MSmits: really.. ahh so close
 Aldoggen: XD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mmmm, fire cats make bacon
 MSmits: It is said people-meat tastes like bacon
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :bacon:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: soylent green, no ty
 Aldoggen: flying pigs could make bacon wings
 Aldoggen: I think I should go back to sleep and start my day all over. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if pigs could fly, we would have sturdy umbrellas
 MSmits: btw, sorry I got here just now. Is the goal of this to make them pull off the bandage and remove the chat now?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :poop:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last chat msg logged wins
 MSmits: ohh I see
 Aldoggen: would they do it on a saturday tho?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: suppossed to be yesterday
 Aldoggen: maybe they still have some time on US east west coast
 MSmits: I don't think they do anything on a saturday. So I suspect we can talk about flying and frying animals all day
 Aldoggen: west*
 MSmits: weekend even
 Aldoggen: if you could talk with ants, would you do it?
 MSmits: with, or to?
 Aldoggen: with
 PatrickMcGinnisII: No, sugar beggars ... annoying
 MSmits: well if they start talking to me, i would reply
 MSmits: it's polite
 Aldoggen: would you also do it if you only could do it on a hot summer day, while holding a magnifying glass over them?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Moths ... they could be your little spies
 MSmits: sure, i'd say sorry
 Aldoggen: XD

 MSmits: yay evalbot is now my best bot!
 MSmits: no more random
 Aldoggen: from 8 to 5 right?
 MSmits: my other bot was 8 yes
 Aldoggen: nice&#160;:)
 MSmits: look what it did to bowwow :P
 MSmits: 23-7 lol
 MSmits: he was 5th before, i basically switched places
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 Illedan: evalbot?
 MSmits: uttt with no random rollout
 MSmits: just eval backpropagated
 Illedan: No book?
 MSmits: nope
 Illedan: Isn't book better?
 MSmits: sure it will be once i generate it again
 MSmits: i figured i'd take this bot to the max without book first
 MSmits: i'm not there yet, might need to learn GA to fit these params properly
 MSmits: my other bot is getting overfitted against =/  I am having to give it 500 ms calc time to provide a challenge
 Aldoggen: maybe bowwow has a bot with similar strategies to your old one then
 MSmits: yeah, but it could also be overfitted against differently. I think this may be a NN 
 Aldoggen: ah
 Aldoggen: well done anyways&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I gtg now, I'll be back in a while 
 MSmits: thanks, I have years of trying for this game. I spend more time on this than on any other bot. To finally just throw it away and beat it with an evalbot is strange :P
 Aldoggen: XD
 MSmits: ttyl
 Illedan: Might try that game one day too :thinking:
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-fantastic-bits/illedan">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-fantastic-bits/illedan</a>
 Illedan: Now I'm back here
 Illedan: xD
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: well that will be a challenge 
 MSmits: +4 to beat
 Illedan: re Curse is boosted a lot by my submits
 MSmits: well same challenge i have really, except there's 3 ppl in between recurse and me 
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: was recurse not at 1 before?
 Illedan: He was
 MSmits: quite an achievement beating pb4 anyways
 Illedan: But during my submission period he was behind pb 4 for a while too
 MSmits: oh i see
 Illedan: Some strats beats him better, as he has bugs&#160;:(
 Illedan: But that is worse against others
 MSmits: yep so dont overfit on his bugs
 Inferno_dragon: the way cg caculate the rank is way crazy
 Karkadel: +
 Inferno_dragon: those game in cg kinda hard
 eulerscheZahl: the new formula was introduced mainly to push me to #1 back then. didn't last long
 Inferno_dragon: really
 eulerscheZahl: of course not
 Inferno_dragon: bruh you made me confused
 Inferno_dragon: and how many bot programming are there that you got 200K point from it
 eulerscheZahl: there are still a lot of games that i haven't touched yet. it's just getting too much to keep up with it
 Inferno_dragon: I think CG need some college knowledge in order to rank up faster
 Inferno_dragon: Code golf seem amazing i forgot to do that
 jacek: MSmits bowwowforeach uses NN
 Inferno_dragon: oh the python golfer dead
 jacek: so people cant do codegolf in python now? nows your chance
 Inferno_dragon: but the old player has chance to rank higher
 MSmits: ahh thanks for confirming jacek. 
 Inferno_dragon: that's bad
 Inferno_dragon: the exec and bytes is down by codingame
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i don't entirely agree with your assessment. You could do a fast minimax on a bunch of these simple boardgames,  but you just dont like em&#160;:)
 Inferno_dragon: I think i will learn ruby to rank up in code golf
 MSmits: no need Inferno_dragon
 MSmits: you just need 5 different languages, ruby doesnt need to be 1 of them
 MSmits: code golf cp is earned per language, 5 max
 Inferno_dragon: ruby plus bash
 jacek: MSmits pretty understandable <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/07/05/195417">https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/07/05/195417</a>
 Inferno_dragon: bash still the best lang
 MSmits: jacek, that could just be explanation on how he encoded his opening book :P
 MSmits: why Inferno_dragon?
 jacek: it called them weights
 MSmits: oh
 Inferno_dragon: cuz we can learn any lang and use it in bash
 jacek: or maybe its trolling
 MSmits: oh you translated it
 MSmits: i mean if you posted your weights it would look like that too :P
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://deepl.com/translator">https://deepl.com/translator</a> is decent
 eulerscheZahl: true, MSmits. it's about priorities. i can't do everything here and still do other contests and keep my sanity
 MSmits: yeah I know. I took this approach quite a while ago. Only I just do the ones you skip, mostly 
 Inferno_dragon: thanks jacek for the transalate
 MSmits: jacek really nice translation, the top paragraph gets translated 100% perfect
 jacek: how can you tell
 MSmits: well it makes perfect sense
 jacek: it could entirely different thing that makes sense
 jacek: id make that troll translator
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/5sy2vQe">https://imgur.com/a/5sy2vQe</a>
 MSmits: it's even worded very nicely
 MSmits: if this is a troll translator i'd be even more impressed
 Inferno_dragon: the second paragraph is impressive too
 jacek: liek this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.yuppiegadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/p-14766-Wrongulator1a.jpg">https://www.yuppiegadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/p-14766-Wrongulator1a.jpg</a>
 MSmits: lol
 Inferno_dragon: lol
 wagabond12: whats that, the wrongulator&#160;? 
 MSmits: it says so on the box
 jacek: probably written in js
 MSmits: no i dont think so, they made it wrong on purpose
 Inferno_dragon: probably use photoshop

 Inferno_dragon: some guru deleted their account how sad
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII burps</b></p><p><img src="/a/75707267075165" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, google works too
 Inferno_dragon: yeah the same transalate as jacek transalator
 PatrickMcGinnisII: actually I bookmarked it like 2 days ago the last time someone posted the japanese link
 MSmits: I like how we can spy on Japanese coders now
 Inferno_dragon: but not encoded coder like this oneexec(bytes('湩異⡴਩㵸湩異⡴⸩灳楬⡴牯嬠崰瀊楲瑮猨牯整⡤⡛ⴰ扡⡳湩⡴⥭Ⱙ⥭映牯洠椠⁮嵸嬩ㄭ孝崱','u16')[2:])
 Inferno_dragon: just like acient character
 MSmits: yeah thats done to save space
 eulerscheZahl: input()\nx=input().split(or [0]\nprint(sorted([(0-abs(int(m)),m) for m in x])[-1][1]
 MSmits: btw, his encoding is suboptimal. He uses array
 eulerscheZahl: that's what it says Inferno_dragon
 Inferno_dragon: how
 eulerscheZahl: open a python terminal, paste the code without the exec part
 eulerscheZahl: bytes('湩異⡴਩㵸湩異⡴⸩灳楬⡴牯嬠崰瀊楲瑮猨牯整⡤⡛ⴰ扡⡳湩⡴⥭Ⱙ⥭映牯洠椠⁮嵸嬩ㄭ孝崱','u16')[2:]
 MSmits: wow
 Inferno_dragon: oh
 MSmits: euler = trained spy
 MSmits: I bet you learned this from doing RAIC
 MSmits: and spying on the Russians
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i'll even play RAIC
 MSmits: it is weird this year
 Inferno_dragon: or he is an agent
 eulerscheZahl: with all the politics and such. not even sure if i could win a tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: and game isn't interesting enough to do it without
 MSmits: yeah, no shirt no glory
 eulerscheZahl: at least my topcoder 21 tshirt arrived yesterday :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: won it in april 2021
 MSmits: you won 21 t shirts?
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: not 21 tshrits. just one with "TCO21" on it
 j4at: lol
 MSmits: it's like you said it and thought, o wait i am talking to msmits, i better clarify
 Inferno_dragon: I thought some company is abundant tshirt 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't have a PY term, what's it say?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: VSC thinks it's an ini file
 Inferno_dragon: vsc really
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only Py i've done has been in notepad for import into graphics prog
 Inferno_dragon: b'input()\nx=input().split(or [0]\nprint(sorted([(0-abs(int(m)),m) for m in x])[-1][1]'

 Inferno_dragon: cuz it used alien language
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did nothing
 Inferno_dragon: no use print PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: they are Japanese, not Zerg
 Inferno_dragon: print(bytes())
 MSmits: though they did zerg last contest tbh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i see it now
 Inferno_dragon: oh codingame might killed the exec() method in python 
 eulerscheZahl: highly unlikely
 Inferno_dragon: that's why i can't cheat in my clash with friends
 eulerscheZahl: there are some many things to potentially block for golfing, like sys calls
 eulerscheZahl: but also hard to do
 eulerscheZahl: for the exec trick you could count bytes instead of chars
 Inferno_dragon: yep but for code shorter than 50 it will give you a longer one
 Inferno_dragon: the optimization is the hardest path in codingame
 Inferno_dragon: the clash player could use your site euler <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Inferno_dragon: oh i shouldn't post that site here
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 jacek: its ran by some scammers i think
 j4at:  yeah its an IP grabber.
 j4at: I always get ddos attacked while playing coc with euler, so he might be(migth not) the owner.
 jacek: win by printing WAIT <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/650376661">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/650376661</a>
 Aldoggen: I have so many questions
 eulerscheZahl: you play CoC with me? i can't recall doing such a thing
 eulerscheZahl: i can confirm that i can extract IP address and user agent from that herokuapp
 _Royale: :scream:
 DomiKo: :D 
 Zorg1: the same for the other CG tools I suppose no&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but it only goes back for less than 1 day and i rarely check
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more interested about what you search. there are users who copy the whole clash statement. and my DB query is poorly written, linear runtime to the number of words :D
 _Royale: so if we lose the chat with can still communicate with you via search queries&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like the easiest wayi should add a feature "the last 10 queries"
 eulerscheZahl: until i run out of dynos again
 jacek: dynos is based on number of visits?
 eulerscheZahl: uptime
 eulerscheZahl: when you visit the site, the process gets started. and shut down after 30min of inactivity
 eulerscheZahl: i get 550h of uptime per month
 eulerscheZahl: thanks to web crawlers i exceed them
 Aldoggen: oof
 BlaiseEbuth: No way to block crawlers?
 BlaiseEbuth: And oy there!
 eulerscheZahl: robots.txt should teach them to check less frequently at least
 Zorg1: if they read it ...
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't care, website is up most of the time :D
 eulerscheZahl: checking robots.txt is already a visit to my website
 Zorg1: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: but when you get denied 10 times in a row, do you check an 11th time that soon after?
 eulerscheZahl: i think there are also ways to tell the crawlers how often to index your website
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. My question was about a way to block them on heroku side before the visit
 Zorg1: consulting robots.txt need the app to be started&#160;? they are not static files that can be served without calling the app&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: but when you can make the crawlers visit less frequently via robots, it's a win already
 MSmits: oy BlaiseEbuth
 MSmits: scroll
 visionspider: blacklisting,  rate limiting, and robots.txt
 BlaiseEbuth: o/ MSmits
 BlaiseEbuth: There's also a pair of html meta args  concerning crawlers iirc
 visionspider: Also its worth knowing not all robots will respect robots.txt guidelines.
 MSmits: like evil robots?
 MSmits: :robot:
 visionspider: haha
 visionspider: yeah
 visionspider: robots who don't follow Asimov's laws.
 MSmits: or maybe they use them as "suggestions"
 eulerscheZahl: no blacklisting. that's no longer politically correct
 MSmits: African Americanlisting
 MSmits:&#160;?
 visionspider: lol
 visionspider: its like github changing master to main
 MSmits: what does that mean
 Westicles: NBA team owners are now governors
 visionspider: github changed the naming convention of master branch to main branch
 MSmits: oh 
 visionspider: because with a master branch all other branches were assumed as "slaves"
 visionspider: lol
 MSmits: silly

 visionspider: So what was blacklisting renamed to?
 visionspider: :D
 eulerscheZahl: inner vs outer list or something like that
 eulerscheZahl: a friend of a prof wrote a book. had to rename travelling salesman problem to travelling salesperson
 visionspider: ok ill try to recall that. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Master and slave... how we used to designate drives
 visionspider: I saw another naming convention for blacklist / whitelist&#160;:  ‘block list’ and ‘allow list,’”
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like with jumpers and sh*t
 MSmits: block list reminds me of minecraft

 MSmits: this renaming over cultural sensitivity seems unnecessary to me, but it doesn't bother me either
 Westicles: this will be next
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_of_connectors_and_fasteners">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_of_connectors_and_fasteners</a>

 MSmits: not sure Westicles, that distinction refers to sex, not gender
 MSmits: if it is next, then that makes no sense
 visionspider: that distinction is so widespread in so many domains
 MSmits: it refers to biological differences, not gender identity
 MSmits: so if they make a problem of it, they are idiots
 Westicles: that wiki could be 5 lines.  it is 1000 lies all about kinky sex stuff
 Westicles: *lines
 visionspider: BlaiseEbuth who can visit your website now lol
 visionspider: lol
 MSmits: Devices used for mating two connectors of the same gender have a wide variety of terms, including for example: "gender changer", "gender mender", "gender bender", and "gender blender"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't get more than 8 depth on ending of CTTT
 MSmits: that wiki is hilarious
 visionspider: is the wiki a satire?
 MSmits: I dont think so
 MSmits: These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include hermaphrodite, androgynous, genderless, sexless, combination (or combo), two-in-one, two-way, and other descriptive terms.

 [Itep]: imo *
 schaa0: @Tsak5422 There are free online courses like cs106a which cover a lot of fundamentals. Once those are settled, you learn the most from doing side projects, preferrably about topics that interest you the most and learn as you go

 Afraaz1: I've added an if statement inside where I check if the absolute value of two temps is equal where it checks if both are negative and then assigns the lowest value the negative value
 Afraaz1: but it doesn't help
 jacek: which test case
 schaa0: i think it's 2nd
 Afraaz1: I got it now 
 Afraaz1: it was the both negative values
 jacek: i think you should always abs the values
 Afraaz1: yea i was but hten i was setting the lowest to abs value
 Afraaz1: which caused issues when both temp and input was negative
 jacek: ah
 Tix81: does anyone have any suggestions for don't panic in less than 200 characters?
 Tix81: i saw someone solved it in c # with less, but i can't get over 350 with this language

 Astrobytes: over should be trivial :P
 eulerscheZahl: c# is the wrong language for golfing
 MSmits: yes. Ask yourself, does trump do C#? If not, why not.
 eulerscheZahl: because he's overqualified?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not. that's why i still use it
 eulerscheZahl: also: you should always ask yourself "what would Jesus do?"
 Crosility: Huh... I came in at a really weird point in this discussion. Trump as in, trump? O.o
 Bob_Rocks: So did I
 Astrobytes: Jesus?
 Bob_Rocks: what is this about trump?

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ten-thousand">https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ten-thousand</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: It's over 9000!
 eulerscheZahl: i hated this puzzle in the contest Crosility. was doing well until i opened it
 MSmits: jacek i am just experimenting
 Tix81: none of you solved it in c # with less than 200 characters?
 eulerscheZahl: you can filter the leaderboard by language
 Tix81: Yes i did it
 eulerscheZahl: 143 is the best for C#
 Crosility: My brain isn't wrapping around what the designers want. Sadly.
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure it's some system call
 eulerscheZahl: the "torus" thing? it's a line, not an actual torus
 eulerscheZahl: lie, not line
 Astrobytes: lol, nice error there
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 jacek: oO
 Crosility: If you mean the transformation, which they claim mobius strip, then sure.
 jacek: TimeEngineer woah bronze
 DrunkeyCPP: how would you write this "myhash = {x:0 for x in mylist}" in ruby/c++? 
 StevenV: Hello guys
 BlaiseEbuth: o/
 StevenV: when I do certificate on CG could I do googling?
 yedi: yes of course
 j4at: yedi can you share your coc solution&#160;?
 TimeEngineer: Jacek yeaaah I did it&#160;! I didn't even know that there was a tictactoe in CG competition, my DQN beats them all :D
 j4at: 26 secs doens't seems realistic to me
 DomiKo: TimeEngineer you mean UTTT?
 TimeEngineer: Yes in wood league Domiko
 DomiKo: I see
 MSmits: oh, the game will change in bronze
 TimeEngineer: I know
 StevenV: the bronze is.....
 TimeEngineer: But I'm confident now about the learning
 Westicles: yedi you must defend your honor
 Crosility: OMG, I solved Detective Pikaptcha 3. O.O. Had to stare at some of the test cases for a stupid long time to see what they ACTUALLY wanted to happen&#160;:(
 MSmits: Crosility we had 4 hrs to solve all 4 puzzles in the actual competition
 Crosility: No way, 4 hours?!
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: i took 3 hr 40 mins or so
 MSmits: mobius took an hour i think
 Crosility: Considering, I piggybacked off Ep2 code for Ep3..
 Crosility: And still took ~2 hours for Ep3.
 Crosility: I don't think I could do it :D Lmao
 MSmits: it was very stressful, i wanted to get 100% before the end, i barely made it
 MSmits: ep4 has a lot of cases
 Crosility: That sounds really stressful. Almost like an extended intense CoC
 MSmits: yeah, it was unique though, we didnt have other events like that
 StevenV: I would stay away from it :D
 Astrobytes: somethingsomething locam sprint somethingsomething
 MSmits: meh locam sprint wasnt a puzzle
 Astrobytes: twas 4 hours though
 MSmits: you could solve it by outputting wait
 BlaiseEbuth: You can now go make a public scandal on the forum saying he use a bot j4at :smirk:
 Crosility: Oh no, episode 4 uses some weird cube transformation.
 Crosility:&#160;:(
 MSmits: yep, that one took me 2 hrs
 MSmits: or maybe a little less
 Crosility: *crys a little on the inside*
 Crosility: I really like these maze/pathfinding puzzles. It really tests my knowledge on some hard subjects.
 Crosility: BUT geez, navigating what they intended by the description, and what the description gives you..
 Crosility: Brain needs a break.
 Westicles: bender ep4?  I solved it manually
 Crosility: Enjoy friends.
 eulerscheZahl: manually is not what you were supposed to do&#160;:(

 eulerscheZahl: no
 j4at: 26 secs by our boi yedi
 j4at: he got 34 secs before that
 devBib: hello is there any docker challanges or games?
 struct: whats the clash
 eulerscheZahl: there is no docker here on CG
 Rafarafa: I see 34 secs for yedi in that link :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: not even to run our code in
 BlaiseEbuth: As I said, sue him publicly on the forum. Already worked for cheaters :speak_no_evil:
 j4at: ops wrong link
 struct: you dont even know if he cheated
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/25034460e8078a30338a0f251f4adc60464371c">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/25034460e8078a30338a0f251f4adc60464371c</a>
 eulerscheZahl: squiddy is gone after all
 struct: But whats the clash
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: is the real question
 BlaiseEbuth: Not the point struct
 Rafarafa: dayum nice he's on fire
 eulerscheZahl: maybe that guy is just better at clashing than you?
 struct: some clashes are solvable in &lt;10 seconds
 Rafarafa: tbh I don't recall him cheating 
 Rafarafa: as in he doing 5mins+ stuff in 20 secs
 j4at: I'm not saying he cheated .. I'm asking him to share his solution. Because eh ignored us in the coc chat and started talking in world
 Rafarafa: ah
 eulerscheZahl: when you clash a lot, some tasks will appear twice
 BlaiseEbuth: Bring him to the gallow poll!
 Astrobytes: what happened to guillotines?
 Astrobytes: off with his head!
 MSmits: they were deprecated
 struct: What was the clash j4at?
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/20739e7af87e7682761095576937ba9196bba">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/20739e7af87e7682761095576937ba9196bba</a>
 j4at: It's pretty  easy but 26secs is pretty good time. I though he is super human
 Westicles: that's really fast for that one
 j4at: but he didn't answer me 
 struct: not possible in 26
 struct: imo
 j4at: so probably a cheater
 BlaiseEbuth: Far much hard to clean than a rope Astrobytes...
 struct: just typing the notes would probably take longer than that
 struct: but who knows
 Rafarafa: oh boy I really hate that one
 Astrobytes: fair BlaiseEbuth 
 Rafarafa: why does it show so much wtf 
 Astrobytes: I think it's quite a nice one, for a clash
 Westicles: he was very polite when he begged for approvals
 struct: maybe python has a trick to solve that one
 struct: import music
 Astrobytes: I told him off for it Westicles
 Astrobytes: lol struct &lt;insert that xkcd&gt;
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not like if nobody ever cheated in clash heh. Some even made a bot to play clashs! :scream:
 j4at:  Well maybe he got scared bc he saw me in clash, so it's understandable.
 Astrobytes: ah modesty :D
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 j4at: :pensive:
 jacek: when you almost give up but some magic starting to happen <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/oqZrZW5.png">https://i.imgur.com/oqZrZW5.png</a>
 struct: whats this jacek?
 BlaiseEbuth: Nice drawing boi&#160;:)
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth patpat jacek</b></p><p><img src="/a/75369242083208" /> jacek: yet another clash of bots attempt
 struct: its NN?
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 j4at: it is
 MSmits: plot twist: jacek is just colouring
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil:
 j4at: Jacek for how many hours did you train your NN
 j4at:&#160;?
 jacek: im 14 now, it was trained for 48 hours. ES coevolution
 jacek: the graph is just another start on bigger model
 j4at: bruh 48 hours :o
 j4at: you used attention&#160;?
 jacek: hyperparams probably not optimal
 jacek: nah, just 5x5 input + rounds + number of robots 
 jacek: i wonder if i can get top5 with this, or do i need to take the whole shuffled map into account
 j4at: you can't get a perfect score with that. recurse probably used all robots inputs + past inputs
 jacek: theres no recurse there oO
 j4at: But that's just a guess
 j4at: oh i mean top1 :p
 jacek: top1 is quiet ahead of others, dunno if he uses NN even
 struct: it's true AI
 j4at: NNs are the true AIs
 BlaiseEbuth: Nah. Those are the true Ais <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale-throated_sloth">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale-throated_sloth</a>
 jacek: no, this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_ass">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_ass</a>
 MSmits: that's some wild ass
 j4at: writing an optimized simulation for clash of bots is hard
 struct: dont need optimization if you useNN
 MSmits: I guess you create an array of bots that you reuse?
 Astrobytes: is clash of bots any good?
 MSmits: it's a weird game, i dont understand the replays
 jacek: visuals are little bugged
 jacek: and another bug - if 2 players have the same number of robots, its a draw. but according to statement, the one with more health left should win ~
 j4at: Well yeah I don't need to optimize it I want to.
 jacek: most time if NN stuff, no need to optimize simulation that much
 MSmits: jacek is it an error in the statement or in the game?
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 jacek: the game. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/650356447">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/650356447</a>
 j4at: I want to optimize it because I worked on 2d game before and I spent a lot of time optimizing it that i became addicted :p
 jacek: its a draw, though the viewer says its his win
 jacek: j4at remember its a torus
 j4at: ofc i know that
 jacek: dunno, maybe you dont read statements
 Illedan: Can't you just download all replays by 1st and use his actions in supervised training?
 j4at: isn't that cheating&#160;?
 jacek: that would requires much more games
 MSmits: you need years worth of cg benchmark budget :P
 Illedan: Not really? :thinking:
 Illedan: 1 game = 100 frames1 frame ~ 30 bots on avg or something?And handle each one independently:5x5x20 inputs?
 Illedan: gives 3k robot actions to learn from each game?
 MSmits: it's not about the number of acions, it's about the number of possible inputs I think 
 MSmits: 2500 * 3000?
 MSmits: i should try to understand the game before i comment :P
 Illedan: Yeah, me2
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Anyone off to my offline training
 Illedan: *Anyway
 MSmits: hf&#160;:)
 jacek: still youd need millions robots positions to train
 jacek: offline training?
 MSmits: he's going to do physical activity i think
 Illedan: Nah, FB
 MSmits: o
 jacek: fantastic bits?
 Illedan: mhm
 MSmits: what'd they rename it to? broom humping?
 Illedan: broomstick flyers
 MSmits: close
 Astrobytes: "broom humping" :D
 MSmits: made sense to me

 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil:
 Astrobytes: that's excellent
 jacek: you killed the chat again
 MSmits: let me revive it with this neat cg stats result: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>  still ongoing, possibly i am lucky
 Astrobytes: I can't take credit for that one jacek
 j4at: No, they are just trying to buy a vibrating Nimbus 2000 broomstick
 j4at: so jacek killed the chat
 MSmits: this is so random. all I did was make one seemingly unimportant param go from 0.8 to 1.0 and it is so much better
 jacek: still fitting params via brute force?
 MSmits: local fitting is pointless now
 MSmits: by brute force anyways
 MSmits: i am just trying them out on the leaderboard
 jacek: spam submits?
 MSmits: different param values, not just spam
 MSmits: but, good news
 MSmits: only 4 real important params to fit
 MSmits: i eliminated some
 jacek: do you use random in submitted code?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i stopped using random locally too
 MSmits: no matter what i did, my normal mcts bot was so weak with it
 MSmits: i cant fit params when it loses 80%
 jacek: you used random on mcts bot, not eval bot?
 MSmits: i had it with 500 ms calc time, really slow too
 MSmits: just mcts bot
 jacek: but you get randoms from mc, i meant to use it to your eval bot ;s
 MSmits: ow
 MSmits: damn i should have seen that :P
 MSmits: 65% WR vs recurse
 MSmits: but this happened before when i had this bot a year ago
 MSmits: it just sucked against everyone else then
 MSmits: should have sticked with evalbot then, abandoned it too soon
 MSmits: yay ended 4th 
 MSmits: 0.01 above jacek :grin: 
 jacek: :rage:
 MSmits: karliso is my true nemesis though. He is not NN, but still wrecks me
 MSmits: i still dont know what he does to have a bot this good
 MSmits: it's not his random rollout. That's fairly basic
 MSmits: (he shared it)
 jacek: or trolled sharing it
 MSmits: did not seem like it, but anything is possible
 j4at: jacek send  your lash of Bots
 j4at: clash of bots simulation :p
 karliso: oh hi
 jacek: oO
 jacek: j4at yeah movement and collisions are tricky
 jacek: i just reimplemented it from referee
 Astrobytes: nice work MSmits
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 jacek: oh look, its the onitama guy
 MSmits: hey&#160;!
 MSmits: long time no see karliso
 karliso: yes, finally got a job
 MSmits: congrats!
 jacek: at UTTT factory?
 Astrobytes: grats!
 j4at: Yeah I finished but found out that mine calculates damage incorrectly
 j4at:  Should read the referee
 j4at: collision damage*
 karliso: ty&#160;:)
 MSmits: I was just talking about you. I made a uttt bot with no random rollout. it is better, but still loses to yours
 karliso: But still mcts?
 MSmits: it's selection expansion, then evasl
 MSmits: eval
 MSmits: uttt is notoriously hard to write good eval for, but i got it to work finally
 karliso: somehow recurse managed to keep nr1 even though I thought my bot stronger. 
 MSmits: maybe other players push him up more
 karliso: Perhaps people test vs me more and I provide more variety?
 MSmits: thats for sure true, those nn bots are usually very deterministic
 MSmits: my eval bot is too. I change 1 param and my bot goes to :poop: 
 karliso: Really nice. Did you automate param-fitting?
 MSmits: no, i suck at this. I need to make a GA framework for it
 MSmits: i dont have many params left though, this is almost doable by trial and error 
 karliso: So hand made eval, impressive.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i implemented your rollout and many variations of it btw
 MSmits: but it was never better for me. I think your random rollout is not the best part of your bot
 MSmits: i think your expansion function is really good
 karliso: Probably. I learned a lot how to tune MCTS, there are definitely tricks I have not shared.
 MSmits: oh, tune? You mean like UCB1 alternatives?
 MSmits: I never got into those
 karliso: I use UCB1, but params are fitted obviously.
 jacek: more like tune C and FPU etc?
 jacek: or maybe even... RAVE? :scream:
 DomiKo: someone can implement RAVE? and not got like 20x less rollouts?
 jacek: welp rave is pointless in uttt. too restricted moves
 j4at: jacek how collision damage works I'm too tired to read the source code 
 jacek: is it about damage only?
 j4at: yeah
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JNc9TmnI7M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JNc9TmnI7M</a>
 j4at: I don't understand the 2 to the right
 jacek: it collides with in front of him, back from him and the left
 j4at: what about the last one to the right it collides with 2
 jacek: hmm you got me
 jacek: the referee uses some graph and resolves at the end only
 jacek: i reimplemented it mindlessly, i wonder if my sim is ok :thinking:
 j4at: hehe
 j4at: The referee is very bad&#160;:) compared to my super optimized sim 
 jacek: at least its not java...
 j4at: I'm not talking about readability but okay
 j4at: so send me your sim&#160;? please :grimacing:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc</a>
 DomiKo: we all know
 j4at: lol
 Astrobytes: must be the first time I ever saw someone asking for someones sim lol (other than the DMs with "i'll pay you X for your bot") :D
 j4at: Bruh i'm using NN the sim is the least important part
 jacek: but thats different link?
 Astrobytes: use the referee then
 Astrobytes: (as it is I mean)
 j4at: Well, I will need to do some digging to compile it + remove extra parts
 j4at: But I don't want to bc very boring
 Astrobytes: well sometimes boring stuff has to be done :D
 Astrobytes: shouldn't take long anyway
 j4at: NO
 j4at: I prefer to finish my python sim 
 j4at: after I find out how collision works
 jacek: python? and youre talking about performance :v
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: don't think the sim has to be that performant tho
 j4at: O(n) in python is faster than O(n2) in kotlin
 j4at: I was talking algorithmic wise
 j4at: not "performance"wise
 Astrobytes: just rewrite the kotlin sections that need optimising
 j4at: Nah I did it for fun I don't need to optimize it 
 j4at: + I already paid jacek
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: mentioning python and performance should be a banable offence
 DomiKo: 100% agreed!
 DomiKo: struct how are Cyborgs going?
 struct: slowly 
 struct: I have no idea what to do
 struct: Im coding sim and hope it does something
 DomiKo: yeah me too, I read forum a bit
 Astrobytes: #winning
 jacek: hmm i tried that case. i think my sim is bad o.O
 j4at:  I bet my live that my sim is faster than jacek's c++ sim .I.
 jacek: ahh wait, its alright. i tested wrong
 struct: I could write a c++ sim without worrying about performance it still would be faster than python sim
 struct: I'm sorry
 Astrobytes: *sorry not sorry
 DomiKo: xD
 struct: or maybe I just don't know python
 struct: and I'm wrong
 DomiKo: you aren't
 jacek: imprt struct
 jacek: import
 jacek: :s
 struct: last time I checked (10 seconds ago) there wasnt any python bot in uttt legend league
 Astrobytes: even with cython or whatever it'll be less efficient and slower
 jacek: 1 rust in top10
 jacek: 26th c# oO
 struct: C# has release mode
 struct: so does rust 
 struct: and performance of rust is similar to c++ I think
 jacek: but its marchete could be c++
 DomiKo: C# =&gt; system(g++ ..)&#160;?
 DomiKo: they it is C++ 100%
 MSmits: there is a javascript in uttt legend
 j4at: you aren't but the algorithmic side matters a lot. Saying that the referee is faster than my sim is like saying that bubble sort in c++ is faster than mergesort/timsort in Python.
 MSmits: but noone can stop you from submitting js if you got to uttt legend with another language
 Astrobytes: C# can be fast if you know what you're doing
 Astrobytes: not *as* fast as rust/c/c++ but faster than java
 jacek: j4at we are talking about the same algorithm
 Ralkey: why are the test cases so slooooow
 jacek: they dont know the referee obviously
 TimeEngineer: Is that normal UTTT bots play so bad&#160;:')&#160;? I want to give my first heuristic lol
 TimeEngineer: own*
 TimeEngineer: Idk why I wrote first
 struct: Only top plays well
 TimeEngineer: Do they&#160;?
 struct: what search are you using TimeEngineer?
 struct: I would think so
 MSmits: every bot in legend plays well really
 MSmits: even top 10 can lose to a rank 100
 Astrobytes: he's using DQN iirc
 TimeEngineer: I have just checked Recurse and Jacek bots
 struct: its hard for a human to tell what's happening imo
 struct: I never watched my bot play
 Astrobytes: other than glaring mistakes yes
 jacek: top bots will lose mostly as p2 against much weaker bots
 MSmits: yes mostly
 MSmits: struct uttt is not that difficult to follow. Somewhere midgame both players will have 2 in a row on many miniboards, but they have to avoid giving away free moves and sending opponent to a winning board
 j4at: jacek if you say so. fixed my sim&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's just difficult to look several moves ahead, but thats true for many games
 MSmits: i find oware much more difficult to follow
 MSmits: i can look 1 or 2 moves ahead, but then the seedcounts start to go fuzzy
 jacek: j4at :tada:
 Cambech: je crois qu'il s'est tromper de channel ^^
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 jacek: sudden spike in uttt submits recently
 struct: and c4
 struct: darkhorse got to rank 4 there
 MSmits: mostly my fault :P
 jacek: bu he submitted on 1st jan&#160;:?
 struct: he got pushed
 struct: from 11th+-
 Astrobytes: hm, 28th &gt; 18th on BT, I'll take that for now
 struct: nice
 struct: minimax?
 Astrobytes: yeah ofc
 Astrobytes: crazy negascouty with something that I don't understand and some other bits
 Astrobytes: I did a rewrite with my alt but it doesn't work as well so gonna have to take this one offline I think to understand properly
 struct: astro try to score your pawns that are on corner a bit lower
 struct: the  ones at the 1st row
 struct: so a1 and h1
 Astrobytes: hehe, yes was trying that earlier
 Astrobytes: I have it written down so I don't forget. I only meant to modify the algo a lil bit and ended up getting stuck here all afternoon
 Astrobytes: all my back rows scoring needs work tbh
 jacek: so you made some breakthrough in bt
 Astrobytes: at least I wreck MSmits
 MSmits: I'm honored to be wrecked
 MSmits: just to be clear,  i didnt just put some random crap bot on there, I actually tried :P
 Astrobytes: It's an extremely tough top 20 in BT
 MSmits: it's extremely tough in most boardgames, but this game doesn't click with me somehow
 jacek: "I only meant to modify the algo a lil bit and ended up getting stuck here all afternoon" oh my
 Astrobytes: It's one of my favourite games
 MSmits: Yeah, that's the sad part for me, i really like it too :P
 jacek: at least you can somewhat say whats going on
 MSmits: you sure can
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Astrobytes: you use EPT on this MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: same as what i do now on uttt
 MSmits: except i dont know how to eval bt
 Astrobytes: if you can eval UTT effing T you can eval this
 MSmits: but i am not the only one that has that problem. struct complains about it a lot. He is just more persistent
 MSmits: I understand uttt better :P
 jacek: no human can understand it
 MSmits: well, i cant follow the game better than i do bt, but i know better what is a good gamestate
 MSmits: and thats what you need for an eval
 jacek: so much gap between 4th and 5th, and 2nd and 3rd
 Astrobytes: BT has a lot more going on, that's true
 MSmits: uttt is easier to split into separate chunks and eval
 MSmits: the game rules do this for you
 MSmits: bt is an interconnected mess
 Astrobytes: you can still split some parts
 MSmits: yeah but the parts depend on the current gamestate do they not?
 MSmits: they are not fixed regions
 struct: There are some fixed regions
 MSmits: pawn a is connected to b is connected to c etc.
 MSmits: it's messy, at least to me
 Astrobytes: well, the top and bottom of the board are always important, the middles important, the edges are important etc etc
 MSmits: sure
 struct: a pawn on 6th row always requires 2 pawns defending the attacked squares
 jacek: attacked pawn is different if its also defended
 MSmits: my head already hurts
 MSmits: gimme my crosses and circles
 Astrobytes: not as bad as mine did whilst trying to understand my 9 months untouched eval earlier
 Astrobytes: also it appears I used bextr in this game
 struct: for what?
 Astrobytes: applying and undoing moves
 Astrobytes: maybe elsewhere, didn't look
 Astrobytes: donno if it was faster or anything, might just have been an experiment
 struct: ah dbd bot is broken
 Astrobytes: yeah it crashes on first turn, very annoying
 jacek: rust eh
 Astrobytes: :D
 TimeEngineer: I didn't understand the rules of the game&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: You lost.
 TimeEngineer: Now I do
 jacek: which game
 LambdaTiger: so this is weird the compare (&gt;) failed 2 ticks????
 jacek:&#160;?
 LambdaTiger: i have a compare if statement and it didnt execute only after 2 more iterations
 TimeEngineer: UTTT, I didn't know that you should play where the opponent has played :sweat_smile:
 jacek: what puzzle?
 LambdaTiger: does it matter? its the Mars Lander
 jacek: well is there any error or warning? about getting all inputs and outputs right?
 LambdaTiger: no it works fine... but the if statement gets executed not at the correct time its just plain weird
 LambdaTiger: i have for eg: if a &gt; b: start_burn()
 LambdaTiger: a is bigger than b (according to debug) but it still loops 2 more loops to start the start_burn() function
 jacek: show us the whole code?
 LambdaTiger: here?
 jacek: i.e. pastebin.com
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: auto pastebin is broken
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.pl/">https://pastebin.pl/</a>
 MSmits: better ping for jacek
 jacek: perl?
 MSmits: perl?
 Astrobytes: .pl
 BlaiseEbuth: oO
 MSmits: jacek... it's your home
 MSmits: you live there
 Astrobytes: .pl is a perl file extension
 BlaiseEbuth: pony land&#160;?
 MSmits: indeed BlaiseEbuth lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 jacek: hmm
 LambdaTiger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/yDVjsSQX">https://pastebin.com/yDVjsSQX</a>
 LambdaTiger: i wrote a description of whats weird...
 jacek: def start_burn():
 jacek: loop in a loop?
 LambdaTiger: yes it terminates when touching the surface...
 BlaiseEbuth: loopception
 LambdaTiger: the code works but it just gets executed late...
 Astrobytes: I'd reconsider those loops
 LambdaTiger: i was thinking ahead of time for next ep:
 LambdaTiger: it will be
 LambdaTiger: def start_burn():
 jacek: firstly, you are meant to print once per loop, so no loops in start_burn()
 MSmits: well at least no more than a single print
 jacek: and you are error printint only v_initial, what is the value of v_speed?
 BlaiseEbuth: vspeed is -45, -47, -49 in the output
 LambdaTiger: vspeed is printed out out with the console so...
 jacek: oh, ok
 BlaiseEbuth: so condition is false
 BlaiseEbuth: abs(-45) &gt;= 62
 LambdaTiger: its 42 not 62
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yes wrong line, my bad
 jacek: but hey, this one works. after vspeed = -45 you are printing 0 4
 LambdaTiger: at 45 im printing 0 0
 LambdaTiger: at 47 im printing 0 4
 LambdaTiger: i figured it out its just  different reporting from console and input it has a small difference
 LambdaTiger: ill send u screenshot
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway that loop is a bad idea
 LambdaTiger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/lNF-kfkQECzs">https://prnt.sc/lNF-kfkQECzs</a>
 jacek: the -45 is is from next frame
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 LambdaTiger: why would it matter tho? it just breaks/forgets the initial loop and continues looping
 jacek: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 LambdaTiger: no its from same ^ i checked
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't read the following inputs
 Astrobytes: cause you're in that loop
 jacek: frankly im surprised it works. you are messing with the inputs with that looped print
 Astrobytes: maybe, I donno, I'm busy, ignore me
 MSmits: LambdaTiger for every time you read 1 set of inputs, you have to give 1 output
 MSmits: if you give multiple outputs before your next input set, you messed up
 LambdaTiger: ahhh @MSmits makes sense
 LambdaTiger: my entire logic doesnt work then
 Astrobytes: correct
 jacek: Astrobytes busy with that 29th rank?
 LambdaTiger: need to make a simple bigger than smaller than
 LambdaTiger: wanted to burn efficiently
 LambdaTiger: sad&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: :zipper_mouth:
 jacek: your entire logic doesnt make sense, but it works ;V
 MSmits: yeah first make it work, then make it better
 Astrobytes: jacek: just some stuff from the other bot that I wanted to try out
 LambdaTiger: hahahaa its meant to calculate at full burn to land at specific v/s
 LambdaTiger: but since with each input i need an output it wont work as planned
 MSmits: you can do as many loops as you want to calculate stuff, just as long as you only give 1 output before the next inputset
 LambdaTiger: deal ^ @MSmits
 LambdaTiger: thnx @all
 Astrobytes: is this ML1?
 BlaiseEbuth: *And read inputs
 MSmits: you can for example calculate the next 10 moves, but you only output the firs
 Astrobytes: ML1 or ML2?
 jacek: MLP
 LambdaTiger: oki guys worked as I intended with 1 output for every input
 LambdaTiger: thnx again
 jacek: :tada:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I been trying my damndest to get out of wood3 CTTT
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can't do more than a depth 8 minmax on endgame
 DomiKo: draw trick?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes
 MSmits: depth 8 is pretty impressive on php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's 40k endgames
 MSmits: do you use ab pruning?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no, it was slower
 Astrobytes: That's not right
 MSmits: no thats weird
 MSmits: it can be slower ofc, but you still get deeper
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and it just gave me win/loss/draw ... not score diff
 MSmits: ab pruning can give score diff
 MSmits: if not, you're doing it wrong
 Astrobytes: ^^^^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i reworked the minmax
 MSmits: better to just copy the algortithm straight off the wiki, thats what i did
 MSmits: but i prefer negamax
 MSmits: also straight off the wiki
 MSmits: it's quite good
 Astrobytes: un-rework it Patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the next depth is 362k nodes ... don't think i can trim enough is the issue for ab
 MSmits: ab doesnt work that way, it's not gonna encounter most of those
 struct: DomiKo the game is a proven draw
 Astrobytes: yeah, defo doing something weird there Patrick
 struct: so you just play drawing moves until opponent makes a mistake and you can find a win
 DomiKo: yes I know
 MSmits: mirrored moves
 struct: To draw you just need to mirror opponent move
 struct: ah ok
 DomiKo: that why I was asking
 Astrobytes: he knows struct, that's why he asked if he was using the draw trick :D
 DomiKo: if you win first half, then you make draw on second one, that's a trick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I also found that if u go first, a move of 3 3 is better than anything else apparently
 MSmits: better trick: Do draw on both halves and keep a minimax running. When it solves, you stop copying and do best move instead
 MSmits: the only reason not to do this is when you're at the top of the leaderboard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i meant 2 2
 DomiKo: MSmits I tried doing it and it didn't work&#160;:( 
 MSmits: what went wrong?
 Sraiti: does anyone understand's the There is no Spoon - Episode 1
 NewCoder09: Hey guys does anyone know when Wontonimo was on last?
 MSmits: why is this hard? You minimax to end of game. If you run out of time, you didnt solve it
 DomiKo: if I break it too soon I often lose, but too late then you have too many draws
 MSmits: if you dont run out of time, you solved it
 DomiKo: to the end LOL
 MSmits: yes to the end
 MSmits: thats what i do
 DomiKo: I tried doing it with MCTS
 Sraiti: anyone&#160;? 
 MSmits: that works too, either you solve or you dont
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when storing partial gamestates i can't get to 40k, but I'm sure the partial minmax everyturn would get deeper
 MSmits: jus tmake sure your solver is good
 MSmits: i dont store gamestates when doing minimax, unless i do some kind of transposition table
 Sraiti: okie 
 MSmits: why store states PatrickMcGinnisII?
 MSmits: i guess TT migth be good here
 MSmits: but do it lossy, just store however many is efficient
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh your idea of running searches in 'background'
 Astrobytes: depends on game
 MSmits: searches in background? Not sure what that is
 Astrobytes: why are you storing gamestates?
 Astrobytes: in minimax?
 Astrobytes: that's insane
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no I'm not, I'm talking about going deeper by spanning the search between moves
 Astrobytes: explain better
 struct: is it bad to store the state on minimax?
 MSmits: it is only good if you use transposition tables struct
 Astrobytes: as a hashed value
 struct: oh I missunderstood 
 MSmits: theres no such thing as "reusing the tree" in minimax, unless it's TTT
 MSmits: TT
 struct: I thought you meant copy the state instead of undoing the move
 MSmits: ah no thats fine
 MSmits: it's convenient to copy it
 NewCoder09: struct do you know when wontonimo was last on by any chance
 Astrobytes: sure, depends on the game
 MSmits: but that copy only has a lifetime of the function
 struct: like 3/4 days ago
 jacek: about week or 2 weeks ago
 NewCoder09: alright 
 struct: or a week
 Astrobytes: 3 or 4 days ago yeah
 NewCoder09: been trying to get ahold of him guess i just miss him by like an hour or something
 jacek: have you tried discord
 NewCoder09: yeah 
 Astrobytes: but did you use the principia discordia
 MSmits: didn't Newton write that?
 Astrobytes: No
 MSmits: he could have
 jacek: dunno, im not physicist
 MSmits: dude was smart
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, i have an error, but it's not in the search
 PatrickMcGinnisII: forgot to empty the board after first game, so my eval function returning bad numbers, wth
 MSmits: empty the board?
 MSmits: undo should restore any changes to board
 Astrobytes: something is wrong in your implementation I think Patrick
 MSmits: I agree, you say weird things that don't fit with how i think minimax works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u said keep minmax running while doing the mirroring
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but you do a new search every turn
 MSmits: if it fails, just mirror
 MSmits: if it succeeds, play best move
 MSmits: you dont keep stuff between turns really
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't measure time like u guys can
 MSmits: why not?
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it varies by +/- 10ms consistently
 MSmits: just use 40 ms then,
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the time checks cost time
 Astrobytes: that seems an irrelevant concern right now
 MSmits: then dont do them every iteration
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's a catch 22
 j4at: phph&#160;? 
 j4at: php*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have an if statement that is refusing to work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if (($turn%100)==0) {
 PatrickMcGinnisII: resets everything for next game
 MSmits: if ((rollouts &amp; 15) == 0) is what i do in uttt
 MSmits: but can make the number larger i guess
 MSmits: 255 should be safe too
 Astrobytes: every game ends at that point?
 MSmits: no, this is a whole rollout
 MSmits: game end is irrelevant
 Astrobytes: at Patrick
 MSmits: oh ok
 Sraiti: can anyone please explain There is no Spoon - Episode 1to me 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u know it swaps first player and plays again
 Astrobytes: @Sraiti: the spoon is not there. It does not exist
 Sraiti: matrix reference 
 Sraiti: Nice one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, figured it out .. i increment the turn counter after the opp move, smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so if I'm player 2 ... it never resets the board
 Astrobytes: make sure that's not the global turn counter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: works fine as player 1
 Astrobytes: search depth + turn counter  is gonna mess the fuck out of your regular turn count
 Astrobytes: *feck
 PatrickMcGinnisII: issue wasn't in the search
 Astrobytes: something still seems odd with your search though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the games i was losing is when the ref chooses me as plyer 2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: board wasn't resetting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dumb
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so when playing in ide, i never switched sides and tested it
 NewCoder09: i finally added simulation to mad pod 
 struct: nice
 DomiKo: cool
 Astrobytes: is it less mad now?
 NewCoder09: yeah 
 DomiKo: lol xD
 struct: now run random search with simple eval
 Astrobytes: return (pod-&gt;state == MAD)&#160;? -1&#160;: 1;

 NewCoder09: past the boss now
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 struct: what search are you using?
 NewCoder09: and im back below him 
 Astrobytes: and what search are you using NewCoder09?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You've made it to the next league.
 struct: grats
 Astrobytes: I'm still concerned about your searching but grats&#160;:)
 struct: i meant grats for patrick
 struct: I think he got promoted
 Astrobytes: I meant for Patrick too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's running wood2
 struct: just my poor understanding :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gained 140 ranks so far
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh maybe it's only 70
 struct: you seem to lose some games patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 8 out of 50 loss so far
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now i'm stuck at #1 in wood2... this freakin game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now i went 9 wins to 2 losses against boss ... would it do any good to resub and try to pull him down?
 struct: yeah
 struct: The boss probably had 28+ points patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reviewing losses
 LazarAngelov: Hello guys
 LazarAngelov: how are you&#160;?&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, looks like I make mistakes just b4 search starts ... I go off mirror moves at turn 89 ... and search doesn't start until move 91 ... so this 1 round gap usually gives me more score ... but not all the time apparently
 Astrobytes: :zipper_mouth:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: boss went down 1.3 on that submit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i know i know, i could explain tho... when i go first i leave a mirror 'hole' ... and sometimes that hole scores very high compared to the mirror move eval
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pshed 1 bot out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pushed 3, loggin off
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: fix your Green Circle instead
 struct: this heat is killing me
 Astrobytes: chill 
 struct: not here
 Astrobytes: we only got about 24
 struct: 24º?
 Astrobytes: in my room rn its 29
 struct: damn
 Astrobytes: yep
 Ayza: you'd die here :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: It's nice
 struct: I dont have a reader
 struct: it feels like 35+ inside
 Astrobytes: I'd prefer 37-40
 struct: thats crazy
 Astrobytes: depends where you are
 Inferno_dragon: what unit celsius?
 Astrobytes: In Greece that was nice
 Astrobytes: C yes
 struct: yes celsius
 Ayza: averaged 39-40+ here on summer
 Inferno_dragon: Some time my room í 41 
 Inferno_dragon: or even more
 struct: its 2:40am here
 struct: thats the problem
 Astrobytes: I'm Scottish but not made for SCottish climate, London summers were like 36-37C, now I get 24C max
 Inferno_dragon: how could you stay that late struct?
 struct: because its too hot
 Astrobytes: same struct, its about 20 outside but that's nto why I'm awake though
 Inferno_dragon: you could sleep
 Ayza: 20 would be considered kinda cold for me
 Ayza: I prefer around 30+
 Astrobytes: me too
 Inferno_dragon: I prefer under 20
 Astrobytes: I prefer over 30 as long as I have a window
 Astrobytes: window/door to open
 Astrobytes: otherwise, without some airflow it can be hell. 
 Astrobytes: Also, the humidity level makes a difference
 Astrobytes: regardless of temp
 Ayza: true it does
 struct: Must be broken
 struct: But it explains it I guess
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/E7N4knK.png">https://i.imgur.com/E7N4knK.png</a>
 struct: High humidity is bad?
 Ayza: yes
 Astrobytes: it's not great
 Ayza: according to google it's 55% in my city now
 Ayza: not bad I guess
 struct: the one that is live gives around 80%+ for my zone
 Astrobytes: still harsh
 struct: That's why it feels hotter at night I guess
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Astrobytes: only solution I ever found was sleeping naked on top of the bed
 Astrobytes: open doors but closed screens
 Astrobytes: I wish I still had this problem
 NewCoder09:  I just got done watching the new thor movie and i come back and it says i will be promoted to legend league
 NewCoder09: yay
 struct: grats
 Ayza: congrats what game?
 Astrobytes: oh your CSB, and which search algo is it @NewCoder09?
 Astrobytes: (got some déja vu)
 Astrobytes: if there is still no response then we know exactly which search algo it is
 NewCoder09:&#160;?  
 Ayza: Linear search
 Ayza: :slight_smile:
 NewCoder09: sorry i was doing something 
 NewCoder09: pretty sure i used linear 
 Wontonimo: "pretty sure"&#160;?&#160;!?
 struct: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: it's your code, you should be definitely sure 
 Wontonimo: hey hey struct!  :wave:
 Inferno_dragon: wait there is linear search?
 Wontonimo: i have no idea what linear search is
 struct: this is linear search
 Wontonimo: 1 2 3 4 5
 Inferno_dragon: sometime I don't know aglo i use math so i could say pretty sure 
 struct: for (int i  =0&#160;; i &lt; array.size(); ++i)if(arr[i] == target)return i;
 Inferno_dragon: omg Linear search is a sequential searching algorithm where we start from one end and check every element of the list until the desired element is found. It is the simplest searching algorithm
 Inferno_dragon: that's js
 Ayza: linear search is the first search you ever do by instinct
 struct: maybe but just wanted to kinda show what linear search is
 Inferno_dragon: well binary is better
 Ayza: - definition by ayza
 Inferno_dragon: I never use linear
 struct: ofc but binary needs to be on a sorted array
 <b>**Inferno_dragon burp</b></p><p><img src="/a/84043629502391" /> Inferno_dragon: oops
 Astrobytes: I'm just a little "concerned" about what newcoder is using for CSB
 Inferno_dragon: but how mad could use linear
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: hey hey!
 Ayza: I use linear search for all puzzles basically
 Inferno_dragon: maybe math
 Wontonimo: hey hey Astrobytes&#160;!  I missed you guys
 Ayza: unless time matters
 Astrobytes: where you been dude?
 Inferno_dragon: like the resistance
 Wontonimo: usually you log off right before I log in Astrobytes
 HenroLST: hellloooo
 Wontonimo: oh, i've sadly lost interest in doing the puzzles and multis a while ago and just hung around for the chat ... then started to feel like an imposter coder
 Astrobytes: ah, well, I've been logged in a lot recently but not awake, so I'll take your word on that :D
 struct: I cant code on last new days
 struct: I probably need a break
 Inferno_dragon: or stalking with a new account
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: ah now, see that happens
 Wontonimo: yup
 Inferno_dragon: that's how alot of top delete their account
 Astrobytes: but you come back
 Wontonimo: ii've been talking with a couple people about NN's on discord though.  that's been fun
 Inferno_dragon: *why
 struct: what doy uo mean Inferno_dragon?
 Wontonimo: oh, NewCoder09 just ping'ed me about his bot in CSB
 struct: do you*
 Inferno_dragon: ah nothing
 Astrobytes: we won't have much choice other than discord soon I guess
 HenroLST: GO ON STRIKE
 struct: again?
 Wontonimo: they've been saying that for a year
 struct: didnt you see the forum Wontonimo?
 Astrobytes: we did all that striking and whatnot
 Wontonimo: no

 struct: pretty much 90%+ of the posts are against it
 Inferno_dragon: if this chat dead i'm gonna out codingame
 HenroLST: no chat = sadness
 Inferno_dragon: so bored
 struct: So comment about it
 Astrobytes: some really nice posts in there too
 struct: Even if it's 2 lines or something
 HenroLST: inferno dragon &lt; zap
 Inferno_dragon: whwy you know that bro
 Inferno_dragon: yeah gotta spam to save this chat
 struct: not spam
 HenroLST: hm i just noticed do yall see my pfp?
 struct: can still be cordial about it
 struct: yes
 HenroLST: weird i cant
 Ayza: I see the default pfp and my old pfp
 HenroLST: meh
 Astrobytes: not currently, but this window has been open for days
 struct: It will update eventually 
 Ayza: probably because its gonna get deleted
 HenroLST: ah
 Ayza: this been my old pfp for a long time now I think
 Ayza: will it ever update
 HenroLST: whenever automaton2000 allows it
 Automaton2000: got it to work for me
 Inferno_dragon: I thought this new was about a few months ago when thibaud first anouce this
 HenroLST: dang no need to flex
 Inferno_dragon: before the spring according to my brain
 Inferno_dragon: spring contest
 Astrobytes: chat deletion has been a thing for at least a year or more now
 Ayza: it's past the due time now
 Ayza: maybe they are reconsidering it
 Inferno_dragon: hope they won't delete it
 Wontonimo: thanks for the link struct.  it's sad.  i'll believe it when it happens.  and when it does it will be a sad day.
 struct: it will happen
 Wontonimo: hey, maybe we can add "?enableChat" to the url to enable it :smirk:
 Inferno_dragon: cuz before the spring challenge there is a test on new account
 struct: and discord will be a failure
 Astrobytes: I doubt they are reconsidering, I believe the time to remove it without negative effects upon the rest of the site was underestimated is all
 HenroLST: perhaps
 Inferno_dragon: that made those new account can't access to the chat
 Inferno_dragon: I once made an account during that time
 struct: yeah
 HenroLST: i made mine after spring challenge though?
 struct: they made a test like that I think
 HenroLST: or was it mid way i forgot
 Astrobytes: the 3 A/B tests
 Wontonimo: it is a headhunting and recruitment company, not kaggle 
 Inferno_dragon: I need to level up in order to access the chat how sad
 Astrobytes: not even that Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: just recruitment
 Inferno_dragon: maybe coderone want that?
 struct: basicly they bought because of CG for work
 struct: its the big companies way
 struct: Buy the competition
 Astrobytes: They could learn a lot from the topcoder model imo
 Westicles: yeah, they see us whining about chat when they are talking about closing the site
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's a slippery slope to the bottom
 Inferno_dragon: yep
 Inferno_dragon: I think Westicles right
 Wontonimo: hmm ... how many times have I gone to the CG official discord channels this year?  ... I have to try and remember if I even have.  Oh, twice because someone messaged all moderators and I wanted the (1) symbol to go away from discord app
 HenroLST: thats the most annoying thing
 Wontonimo: i didn't read what was said, just clicked it to make the notification go away
 Astrobytes: Yeah, like I said in my forum post, most of us keep it on silent because of the spam
 HenroLST: just having one random noti
 Ayza: cool trick, right click on the server and press mark as read
 Ayza: don't even have to read the message
 Astrobytes: "Mute" is better
 Wontonimo: and which room would I go to for a casual hangout with the regular crew&#160;?
 Astrobytes: you're still in Shelter?
 Ayza: I mute basically all servers
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Ayza: because I care about mentions only
 Astrobytes: And I'm 'owner' of that so all good
 Wontonimo: powned by Astro
 Astrobytes: :D
 Westicles: I just click the link above and have to put in a birthday every time
 struct: the join discord?
 Westicles: yeah
 Astrobytes: you're not on that discord group
 struct: I think they added verification to enter
 struct: and captchas or something like that
 Inferno_dragon: I rarely chat in Codingame discord
 HenroLST: theres a verification?
 Ayza: I think it'll be easier to build an anti spam bot in discord
 struct: for discord server, but im not sure
 Ayza: I've built one
 Ayza: that's one positive thing: bots
 Inferno_dragon: Or rework this chat
 Inferno_dragon: cuz discord really annoying
 Inferno_dragon: I don't think some puzzle newbie could handle without help
 struct: I wonder what the&#160;% of member will move from chat to discord
 struct: 5%?
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes and struct , have either of you been experimenting with any new algos lately?  I've been chatting with jace about his latest NN adventures.  Cools stuff.  I've got nothing
 struct: not really I still want to try NN
 struct: But I cant code lately
 Astrobytes: Other than improving my alphabeta variations no, not really
 Wontonimo: densely connected network is what jace used in the last contest!  It worked really well for him.  It has surprised me.
 struct: This is 1 thing I found that it might be interesting for NNs but i dont have 1

 struct: check page 117
 HenroLST: hey is it possible to do a getline(cin, string) and somehow not pick up the spaces?
 struct: Its like an improved UCB
 Astrobytes: and I really should get my finger out my ass and start learning more about practical NN use
 struct: That it works better for lower rollouts
 Inferno_dragon: iff this chat die i will remember cg
 Wontonimo: SARSA-UCT&#160;!?!  that's cool
 struct: dont think so HenroLST
 struct: did you heard about it before Wontonimo?
 HenroLST: oof ok, thanks
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: jaceks DQN for that contest was epic, he really smashed that
 Wontonimo: no!
 struct: the winrate vs normal UCB looked interesting so I shared it
 struct: maybe someone with NNs can make it work
 struct: :p
 Westicles: HenroLST just do while(cin&gt;&gt;s)
 HenroLST: ye but will it work if i want to distinguish different lines of input?
 Inferno_dragon: thinking of heck
 Astrobytes: montage of heck?

 Astrobytes: Right, I need a snack and then sleep. Assuming the chat is still here tomorrow I'll see you all later :D
 Wontonimo: where is the post-mortem for the green circle&#160;?
 struct: only if its more than 5 lines pewpew

 Inferno_dragon: omg how checking every check point???????????????
 Astrobytes: HenroLST: very appropriate for what I was listening to earlier
 PewPewBewm: This invisible mouse code window thing is annoying&#160;: /
 HenroLST: hehe
 Thorcode: python golfing dead in codingame really bad new for me
 struct: why is it dead?
 Thorcode: maybe Codingame kill the exec
 Thorcode: oh nah
 Thorcode: exec still alive
 Thorcode: maybe Codingame only use latin 
 Westicles: 17.632 really?  no wonder the backup took forever
 struct: whats that number?
 Westicles: I guess puzzles solved
 Westicles: *27
 Inferno_dragon: yep
 Inferno_dragon: the puzzle you solved
 Inferno_dragon: how
 struct: number of puzzles * number of languages
 Inferno_dragon: 27 languages 653*27 + 1
 Inferno_dragon: cuz his c++ has 654
 struct: yeah
 struct: nintendo

 ThornFlynt: maybe I'm processing the wrong data... hmm...
 hex.master8: how do you change your profile picture
 java_coffee_cup: open your "Profile" page, mouse over your icon picture, click
 hex.master8: Thanks
 hex.master8: I cant find my icon picture
 java_coffee_cup: top right corner to open a pull-down menu under your name, find Profile. Go into it. On the top banner you can change your icon picture and background
 hex.master8: I don't see an option to change my profile. I can only see the banner. Can't see any icons
 java_coffee_cup: It could be easier to ask in discord and post a screen cap to show what you can see. 
 hex.master8: Ok I joined

 Passifi: Sorry you're in the wrong place this is the real world Las Vegas :sunglasses:
 MdAshfaqulHaque: but you are on online,pal
 Passifi: Online is the new real
 MdAshfaqulHaque: virtual 
 Passifi: So I am working on the if else puzzle and I wonder whether I am on the comopletly wrong track here If I have a tree of conditions do I not get the amount of possible results by simply adding up the amount of endpoints&#160;? 
 Phi-: hii i am back to CG or i think i will good now
 bigmazi: is it possible to get rid of needing to pass captcha every time?
 nnovich-OK: Guys, in other IDEs I'm used to VIM mode with remapped ESC key to combination of "kj". In VIM itself I use ":inoremap kj &lt;esc&gt;", same works in MSVC2019. Can anyone help me with remapping esc in codingame?
 nnovich-OK: Attempt at using "inoremap" directly doesn't work and for keybindings I need to know proper command to return from "insert mode".
 Kitkat260: goood morning
 TheCoderBro: good morning
 ZainRaza1: bro any hint
 ZainRaza1: coderBro
 ZainRaza1: D mod 4&#160;?
 KiwiTae:&#160;?
 Westicles: modulo
 ZainRaza1: KiwiTae we are in same clash of code
 KiwiTae: im not doing coc
 KiwiTae: Westicles o/
 Wontonimo: bigmazi yeah, do something other than CoC, like try this puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 DhrbP57: how use shield? ;p
 Wontonimo: DhrbP57 which game?
 Uljahn: CSB perhaps
 Uljahn: print the string, output should look like: 4444 5555 SHIELD
 jacek: what if he wanted to use SHIELD in uttt?
 DhrbP57: csb and thanks
 Wontonimo: i tried that jacek, and for some reason it didn't improve # of TPS, weird eh?
 Rypakka: Hello
 Kitkat260: hi
 KelvinAndHubbles: hi
 Kitkat260: hru
 HunterEhrenfeld: hi
 BoatBuilder: hi
 Kitkat260: anyone want to be my friend
 Katespizer: issogood
 Katespizer: mine is abusing String.raw 
 issogood: interesting, but i don't really get it&#160;;)
 JohnathanBarbee: oof. I'm about to loose so many positions in UTTT.
 JohnathanBarbee: lose
 KelvinAndHubbles: can not tell you how many times I submit for a short too quickly because I think its a fast and I try to refractor by fast because I think its a short in CoC
 awnion: how someone got top 4 in CoC in 13 games?
 darkhorse64: @kovi: you shall not pass
 darkhorse64: :slight_smile:
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh the nice bot&#160;! :o
 RanDom2113: what language should I start with? im brand new to coding 
 BlaiseEbuth: C
 Kitkat260: sup
 BlaiseEbuth: What do you want Kitkat260&#160;?
 Kitkat260: wdym?
 Kitkat260: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 kovi: darkhorse64 - you and Tuo is definitely stronger than the rest of us
 darkhorse64: my first ever #1 (won't last forever) in a multi, so I spend my bragging rights before it's too late
 Tuo: well i just dropped within reach. this game is so random :slight_smile:
 Kitkat260:&#160;?
 kovi: my first ever python...not that it matters
 darkhorse64: yeah we are sometimes switching places
 darkhorse64: performance is not a concern, so it's a good place to exercise your Python skills
 kovi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3aa5dacc-6d6c-4c76-a4f9-025960461974">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3aa5dacc-6d6c-4c76-a4f9-025960461974</a>
 kovi: meh, the point is:single lucky game makes up half of the randomness (+some weird and impossible solutions on that)
 MadKnight: Kitkat260 he means like u keep saying hi every 5 hours
 MadKnight: for a few days now
 darkhorse64: I have tried to analyse some of my severe defeats (#4 place): bad hand and miscommunication
 darkhorse64: and you are out
 RanDom2113: how long have you guys been coding for?
 MadKnight: not long enough
 darkhorse64: for CG&#160;?
 MadKnight: or maybe for too long
 BlaiseEbuth: :older_man:
 MadKnight: who knows?
 awnion: ~26 years&#160;:)
 kovi: 37
 MadKnight: imagine being coding for just 26 years
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 RanDom2113: darkhorse64 yeah or just in general
 awnion: only first 25 years of coding are hard
 MadKnight: it's always only all the previous years of coding that's been hard
 RanDom2113: 25 :open_mouth:
 darkhorse64: CG: 2 years, in general, I don't wanna count
 RanDom2113: that's impressive 
 BlaiseEbuth: You're all so old, or started very young...
 awnion: started in 95 when I was 8 y.o. father bought me XZ Spectrum&#160;:)
 reCurse: Why not both
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, you're old awnion
 awnion: only 33 life just started :stuck_out_tongue:
 BlaiseEbuth: Sooo old.
 BlaiseEbuth: You're older than me, so you're of course very old.
 JohnathanBarbee: I started programming in the late 1400s
 Wontonimo: for work, 27 years.
 jacek: steam cpu?
 MSmits: i think he means 14:50 today
 Astrobytes: Or it's powered by plutonium and a flux capacitor
 Astrobytes: (the CPU)
 MSmits: makes sense too
 Andrew-H: Im a 17 year old coding warlord
 Andrew-H: Watchout for your job
 MSmits: you want to be a teacher?
 darkhorse64: i am terrified
 Astrobytes: I have instantly resigned.
 MSmits: oh noes, the teapot is turning green
 struct: hi
 KalamariKing: Howdy
 KalamariKing: Chat's kinda dead, you could revive it if you wanted
 jacek: or AutomatonNN or Automaton2000 could do it
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Automaton2000: you can reach gold with that

 KalamariKing: Your CPR brought a burst of life!
 OmerDrk: bruh moment öyle bir andır ki:
 Astrobytes: jacek :rofl:
 jacek: and the chat is dead, AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: for every one that would be a big company to make a blog reCurse with your code for a while
 jacek: :open_mouth:
 jacek: Automaton2000 what time is it
 Automaton2000: i think the problem with that is
 rubber_duckie: having had to do the captcha twice
 rubber_duckie: this is the first time I've faced a captcha on this site too
 Wontonimo: you were that awesome that the system thought you were surely a bot
 Wontonimo: rubber_duckie you could try something other than Clash, like this super popular bot battle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 tutubalin: rubber_duckie that's just MathieuGanesan looking for bot friends.
 Wontonimo: tutubalin do you know this quack?
 rubber_duckie: XD and okay, I'll surely look into the challenge
 tutubalin: Wontonimo kinda. we clash sometimes
 rubber_duckie: woah! you guys are rated so high!
 rubber_duckie: btw, suggestions for getting into AI?
 Wontonimo: like into fun AI or realworld AI?
 rubber_duckie: realworld please!
 jacek: lets ask AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 jacek: oh my
 Wontonimo: be willing to do the work and learn.  Seriously, that is so much AI work going on, that if you get onto a team as just a regular programmer, you can make opportunities for yourself
 Wontonimo: for you next job, look for something that supports a data science team or an AI team
 rubber_duckie: I just passed high school tho
 rubber_duckie: really not sure how to get into this field...
 achatell: It's not so easy to start with AI
 Mohamed_Kharrat: do computer science then AI for your masters
 Mohamed_Kharrat: u can't start straight with ai
 reCurse: If you're serious about AI take a statistics class
 jacek: :scream:
 Tristan28729608752: just take a skikit course first 
 Tristan28729608752: and maybe tensorflow afterwards
 Tristan28729608752: if youre programming in python 
 Tristan28729608752: which i would recommend
 reCurse: Or pytorch if you prefer having fun
 Tristan28729608752: yeeeah
 Tristan28729608752: keras is great too
 Tristan28729608752: for tensorflow
 rubber_duckie: noted
 rubber_duckie: any book suggestions?
 tutubalin: "How to pass captcha for robots"
 rubber_duckie: XD
 rubber_duckie: okay...that may be my first project...create an AI that passes captcha
 Wontonimo: if you want to get serious with neural networks, learn matrix math, like transforms, inversion, identity, algebra.  It will seriously boost your insights into NN archicture
 tutubalin: at the time when you learn all that stuff, NN architecture will change greatly
 jacek: but basic math will stay the same
 tutubalin: yeah, you still can use it in gamedev&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: linear algebra is linear algebra
 Astrobytes: +1 on stats btw
 tutubalin: the problem of modern NN is that they are based on linear algebra
 tutubalin: there's no such thing as multiplication
 struct: o.o
 tutubalin: but, probably, natural NNs are based on the same principles. that's why we cannot multiply 473 by 519 in mind
 Astrobytes: Never compare a real brain to artificial NN, or vice versa. It's a very loose 'connection'&#160;:)
 jacek: full connection?
 jacek: like in MLP
 reCurse: You mean GAs are not the same as biology?
 reCurse: My life is a lie
 Wontonimo: *gasp*
 Astrobytes: lol reCurse&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i'm not sure what you mean by "no such thing as multiplication" tutubalin
 Wontonimo: signal amplification is multiplication
 jacek: dot product uses multiplication
 reCurse: You cannot predict the result of a multiplication with a regular NN
 tutubalin: Wontonimo can a neuron multiply inputs on each other, not just on constant weights?
 jacek: oO
 tutubalin: or, can you train NN that given 2 inputs X and Y outputs their X*Y
 reCurse: Mathematicians say no at least
 Astrobytes: They always say no 
 awnion: depends =)
 jacek: who would believe them
 tutubalin: because NN is linear
 awnion: not really
 Wontonimo: add a non-linear layer
 Wontonimo: relu tanh sigmoid ... sure it isn't x*y , but it isn't linear either
 awnion: you can make Furie series coeffs and approximate almost every function NN will just guess coeffs and inputs
 tutubalin: ok, you break linearity a bit
 tutubalin: but you cannot make it polynomial
 Wontonimo: completely and utterly.  nn can solve xor.
 tutubalin: how many layers do you need?
 Wontonimo: 1 hidden.  a 2-3-1 network
 Wontonimo: and it can do x*y, first layer goes though log as the activation function, output is exp function
 Wontonimo: exp( log(x) + log(y) ) = x*y
 jacek: exp as activation?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: i don't know why mathmaticians get so hung up on these kinds of things
 Astrobytes: Correctness.
 tutubalin: ok, that's nice idea
 tutubalin: i just wonder, how it will work with training
 Wontonimo: it's used in nearly every network in that has logistic regression.  The loss function uses log loss and adds then, which is effectively saying 
 Wontonimo: we want to minimize the multiplication of all the errors
 Wontonimo: log(x1) + log(x2) + log(x3) = log( x1*x2*x3 )
 reCurse: I'm not a mathematician but the way I understood the argument is the boundary is the problem not the representation
 tutubalin: how log works with zero and negative numbers?
 reCurse: Another good point
 Wontonimo: :D
 SembeiNorimaki: are clash of code users real persons or bots? I always see the same people and it's unlikely that every day then are connected at the same time as me
 tutubalin: SembeiNorimaki if it is level 7, then it is a bot

 Astrobytes: ^ explains the reasons
 AntiSquid: no clash links&#160;! /ban Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: ya learn something every day.  i didn't know CoC had bot ghosts.  no wonder they no talk much
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Devinawesley: This is such a neat site. Hadn't heard about it until the other day. Company I'm interviewing for sent me here
 JLukeSkywalker: definitely a great site, GL!
 Wontonimo: hope to see you around Devinawesley , how'd the interview go?
 phly95: I'm using this site because of an employer too, but I am very rusty, so I'm learning how to do things before I do the interview stage.
 Devinawesley: The initial interview went fantastically. I should be hearing back tomorrow to schedule the second interview
 Devinawesley: I'm really hoping it all goes well. I'd be totally changing careers. Currently I'm in Automotive Quality. 
 Wontonimo: enjoy the Clash phly95 , but also check out the other things here.  There are tons of bot battles and coding challenges
 phly95: I'm mainly focused on practice right now.
 bafian: im searching for a coding clash code that I couldn't do 
 bafian: but i don't find it

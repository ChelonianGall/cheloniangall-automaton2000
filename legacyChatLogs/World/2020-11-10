 Aya_Noaman: can someone explain the stub generator
 Aya_Noaman: im creating a game but i dont rly understand from the directions

 Westicles: Just find a similar puzzle and copy it
 Aya_Noaman: DaNinja yes i read it
 Aya_Noaman: Westicles so im just supposed to duplicate a game? no way
 Aya_Noaman: well
 Aya_Noaman: if u tried before can u just tell me what to do when the only input is a number
 Westicles: No one will consider it cheating if you copy someone else's stub generator
 Aya_Noaman: ok
 DaNinja: read &lt;variable&gt;
 Aya_Noaman: thanks thats it?
 DaNinja: guess so
 Aya_Noaman: :thumbsup:
 Aya_Noaman: no it doesnt work
 Aya_Noaman: is there sth i should write in the input other than the number?
 Westicles: read N:int
 DaNinja: ^
 Aya_Noaman: ok
 conaldev: hi
 IcyFlamer1: hello
 Vik-ing: How do we use "console.log()" to check the variable we have? Since we use it to submit our answer.
 IcyFlamer1: is it python because i only use python
 Vik-ing: It regards JavaScript.
 IcyFlamer1: oh
 Vik-ing: In Python I assume it is "print()" or?
 IcyFlamer1: yes its print
 victorianionescu:     // Write an action using console.log()
 IcyFlamer1: i understand a little js so i might be able to help
 jrke: Vik-ing click on three dots button which is present on viewing replay 
 Vik-ing: Victorianionescu, thanks!

 IcyFlamer1: im like bronze now
 IcyFlamer1: any help?
 IcyFlamer1: hello?
 Vik-ing: What have you tried so far?
 DaNinja: the forums have a lot of discussions on CSB
 Uljahn: colliding could be completely ignored until gold and then just some shielding should be enough for legend
 Uljahn: drifting is more important i guess

 eulerscheZahl: good news everyonei've set up VS code, i'm ready for the contest
 DomiKo: good news.. or not.. my laptop is dead&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 eulerscheZahl: i hope you have a backup
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: but I don't have another good device&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: amazon express delivery? the contest is near
 eulerscheZahl: or a real hardware shop that you visit in person
 DomiKo: I'm hoping that it will be repair before end of contest
 DomiKo: or I will be coding from 13<i> tablet</i>
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds rough
 DomiKo: that thing is cheaper than some parts from my keyboard...
 DomiKo: I'm hoping that just battery died or something not important
 eulerscheZahl: so its not turning on at all?
 DomiKo: nope
 DomiKo: no signal of life
 DomiKo: it looked like it wasn't even charging

 eulerscheZahl: "very very quick upgrade of the DB server, should have been back in 2 minutes. Preparing for the Fall Challenge 2020"from the discord server
 eulerscheZahl: might be related to your clash problem?
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl u gonna do the contest in c#&#160;?
 Aya_Noaman: guys
 Aya_Noaman: playing against clash bots is NOT COOL.
 Aya_Noaman: For the last 5 games i always came in scnd or third because of a bot.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm doing all contests in C# since Hypersonic
 Majeck: Aya_Noaman I think it depends
 eulerscheZahl: the clash bots only reproduce what real players did in the past
 Majeck: This is purely anecdotal but when playing alone against bots I feel they're better
 Aya_Noaman: yea but is it fair to be beaten by a bot in less that 30 secs?
 Aya_Noaman: the average in the game in question was about 2 min
 Majeck: Yeah, that never happens when playing with  real people
 eulerscheZahl: if the task is easy: yes
 Majeck: At least to me
 Majeck: It's purely anecdotal in my case but I think bots perform better if you're alone in a clash with them
 Aya_Noaman: I think were better off playing against real ppl unless we chose to  include a bot or two, agree?
 Aya_Noaman: maybe higher levels cud do that
 Majeck: I think bots are absolutely awesome
 Hjax: if there were no bots, no one would play clash
 Majeck: I didn't even know they were bots for like a year
 Majeck: The reasoning behind putting them in is great
 Aya_Noaman: Yea but if there was the choice of adding a bot it would be easier for beginners like me
 struct: Hello
 Hjax: STRUCT 
 eulerscheZahl: STRUCT
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Majeck: And I love the transparency, just click on any of their profiles and you get linked to the articles
 eulerscheZahl: we saw you dead and rotting in your basement
 struct: Hi everyone, sorry euler
 darkhorse64: Just in time for the contest&#160;?
 struct: Can I pm you?
 ajb1093: start the clash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 eulerscheZahl: sure, you can PM all of us
 Aya_Noaman: hey can i join too
 Hjax: glad to see you again struct, its been a while :D
 eulerscheZahl: 4 months
 struct: I did not even know that I was a mod until now 
 struct: I'm happy to see you all again
 AntiSquid: it's ok i understand why you'd miss me
 struct: Who are you?
 AntiSquid: glad you are well too lol, so what were you up to&#160;?
 struct: Not much, I see the site changed quite a bit

 AntiSquid: we are waiting for the grow a tree addition .
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.forestapp.cc/">https://www.forestapp.cc/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: quest map and some certificate that praise you like a god for reaching CSB legend.but the real content is still the same
 eulerscheZahl: we have to summon Astrobytes to share the happy news
 struct: Is the site a bit slower?
 struct: Like laggy?
 eulerscheZahl: database update
 eulerscheZahl: might not be fully index yet, not sure
 DomiKo: ohh i pushed 5 people to Wood 1 in penguins :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i pushed at least that many into the icy water
 DomiKo: :joy:
 luc1fr: hey guys
 luc1fr: or ladies may be
 BenjaminUrquhart: he exists
 BenjaminUrquhart: the account-deleter themselves 
 eulerscheZahl: now he doesn't have to delete his account anymore
 eulerscheZahl: he can ban all of us instead so *we* are the ones who have to start again
 BenjaminUrquhart: woah
 struct: Who wants to be first?
 BenjaminUrquhart: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i just want to have some fun
 eulerscheZahl: I nominate AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: which puzzle you did :P
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: no fun allowed
 Automaton2000: why did i just walk into?
 jacek: AutomatonNN who is the most noob
 AutomatonNN: hey guys
 eulerscheZahl: we all are
 jacek: and i see notclass is back
 Dark_Dave007: HELLO
 jacek: HI
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo you should really add some pushing to your Penguins bot
 jacek: and i should add actual heuristics into mine
 eulerscheZahl: *a search
 jacek: A* you say? maybe ill try
 eulerscheZahl: :rolling_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: i'll grab some food
 struct: I see that dbd has been dethroned
 DomiKo: eulerscheZahl yeah, I'm adding it right now
 Aya_Noaman: join my game from #clash
 Aya_Noaman: short mode

 Astrobytes: As long as you're alright it's cool
 jacek: -9997 and you win? fix your score
 DomiKo: yeah still working :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, getting into top10 already. well done
 struct: Is the console output bugged? It doesnt seem to keep up with the current frame of the game
 DomiKo: not yet I guess
 struct: If i try to press the arrows on the viewer
 DomiKo: but when I add pusing maybe
 DomiKo: struct in Penguins I see ouput for round 1 and 2 in the first round
 DomiKo: soo yea I guess its bugged
 struct: Its working now, weird
 eulerscheZahl: looks fine for me
 eulerscheZahl: what are you playing?
 struct: Just pressed play my code on csb
 eulerscheZahl: "submit" is "test in arena" now
 struct: any difference?
 eulerscheZahl: longer text
 eulerscheZahl: more to read
 struct: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: More confusing
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are in Robin Hood mode now
 struct: Maybe its a placeholder for a new feature
 BlaiseEbuth: It's Link&#160;!
 struct: Who's link?
 Astrobytes: Robin Hood :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: little Rob riding hood
 Astrobytes: Zelda... Link...
 BlaiseEbuth: Because of the "Zelda" contest
 eulerscheZahl: surprisingly hard to find a wizard hypnotoad

 eulerscheZahl: neither a wizard nor a toad. i give you 0 out of 2 points
 Astrobytes: :D
 jrke: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Some kind of turtle... Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: at least the way i did it again

 Majeck: Should I use ints, floats or doubles for storing positions Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: that's why you have to find the bug

 <b>**eulerscheZahl creates multiplayer and uses own avatar in default game</b>then changes avatar and CG deletes the old profile pic<b></b></p><p><img src="/a/20062809897700" /> Majeck: eulerscheZahl I always thought that your hypnotoad was from Dave the Barbarian, I don't know what to do with my life now that I know it's from Futurama
 eulerscheZahl: that looks depressing jacek
 eulerscheZahl: i'll use it if i ever fail to reach legend
 jrke: it looks tired for contest
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know what Dave the Barbarian is :D
 eulerscheZahl: but i've seen every Futurama episode
 Astrobytes: The Adventure Time one is good. The wizards all live inside the toad, you can't see them until it opens its mouth really wide
 Astrobytes: (the one Hjax linked)
 jrke: my harry potter looks good nothing to change in that&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that's Harry?
 jrke: yup
 Astrobytes: Looks more like Emo Harry
 eulerscheZahl: even now that I know it, i don't see it
 jacek: or try the one from the group paint <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/H3dRPJm.png">https://i.imgur.com/H3dRPJm.png</a>

 jrke: yup
 eulerscheZahl: wait, who modified my hypnotoad? :rage:
 Hjax: ive viewed peoples profile pictures like that before, only to discover their profile picture is a full screen screenshot, showing their browser and open tabs 
 Hjax: zoomed in on just the picture for codingame 
 Gabbek: hello everyone&#160;:)
 Majeck: eulerscheZahl what about: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ncwinters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ACuriousInfluence_600x600.jpg">https://ncwinters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ACuriousInfluence_600x600.jpg</a>
 Gabbek: pictures discussion, interesting
 Gabbek: that looks pretty
 Hjax: hello Gabbek, excited for the contest? 
 eulerscheZahl: i saw some real pic of a user who zoomed in to a fancy text on his tshirt
 Gabbek: Hjax looking forward to it, yeah - first contest of mine&#160;:) hoping to reach gold somehow
 eulerscheZahl: that's a nice one Majeck
 eulerscheZahl: hm, we could automate this to see the profile and background images of the first X users from the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: but not now, cat needs me
 Gabbek: Hjax I've been experimenting quite a bit with my state copying in python; uhh... making classes for tiles in grid is not smart :D around 20 times slower compared to other methods&#160;:(

 Hjax: yeah, the less data representing the game board the better
 Hjax: ideally either an integer array or just a long if the game is bitboard-able
 Gabbek: struct good to see you! You don't know me - just a reader of yours from forums&#160;:)
 Gabbek: of yours posts*
 struct: Hi
 struct: I don't think I wrote much but thanks
 jacek: wizard and frog eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/UWOOYGS.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/UWOOYGS.jpg</a>
 Gabbek: toad mage... hmm, euler will have a class on his avatar as well? :P toad mage, toad warrior... there's lots of possibilities!
 Gabbek: Hjax are you doing anything at the moment? If you're interested in trying out some ideas on one of the multis you haven't tried then I'm up for it
 Hjax: im at work, plus im not really interested in starting a multi right before a contest
 Gabbek: trying to find something fun to do while waiting&#160;:) decided to push out my xmas rush bot from silver but... guess I'll do that later - too lazy to re-write my insanely crappy copying of states :D
 Gabbek: sure thing
 Hjax: as long as the contest doesnt have a massive random element / tons of fog of war 
 Hjax: ill probably be playing a lot of it 
 Gabbek: then I'm sure we'll catch each other
 Hjax: chat is usually really active during contests, lots of lively discussions 
 Hjax: it will be fun ^_^
 jrke: yup contest makes all inactive users active
 Gabbek: guess there are many issues like yesterday in general, right?
 Hjax: ooo, the_duck is signed up for the contest 
 Hjax: i hope he plays, hes really good 
 Gabbek: (I don't even know what the entire fuss was about - was too confused to join in on discussion :D )
 struct: what happened?
 eulerscheZahl: saw the duck too. did really well at amadeus
 Astrobytes: nah, less spammers/trolls in contest time usually
 eulerscheZahl: or relatively less so you don't notice it that much
 eulerscheZahl: or mods being more active to react faster?
 eulerscheZahl: so many possibilities
 Hjax: the duck got honorary first place at amadeus, he held rank 1 for like, 7 of the 10 days 
 Gabbek: struct some trolling, I think - involving bans if I'm not mistaken
 Astrobytes: Either way, it's better 
 struct: What was amadeus?
 jacek: bans for trolling? :scream:
 jrke: i think i was one of those spammers during spring challenge :thinking:
 Gabbek: are there contests which aren't on multi?
 Hjax: @struct Unleash the Geek
 jacek: amadeus? kurisu makise?
 Hjax: el psy kongroo
 struct: There was some Gabbek
 struct: Please dont say that name Hjax
 struct: dont mention it&#160;:(
 Hjax: you asked XD 
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot the contest name for a moment
 Gabbek: Hjax Steins Gate - right?
 jacek: was it one with mining and radar?
 jrke: there are many - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 Hjax: yep Gabbek, my favorite anime
 Gabbek: oh, thanks jrke
 eulerscheZahl: the first ones were puzzle contests with a 4h duration
 jrke: what was the criteria for ranking then?
 Gabbek: the last crusade as 4h duration? Yikes... I remember solving those for a long time, but then again - I'm pretty slow
 Hjax: not too long ago i was looking to see if an American had ever won a contest, and the answer looked like no

 jrke: ubisoft,In which recurse works?
 Gabbek: just in last 5mins I've seen things I haven't seen ever before :D
 struct: this is from bordeaux
 struct: france
 jrke: yeah btw euler where you got that link?
 eulerscheZahl: that's where I found it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/bOJeFrG">https://imgur.com/a/bOJeFrG</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there are some more things you haven't seen before i bet
 Gabbek: I remember watching recurse's stream - that was really pleasant experience; most of the streams are about clash of codes right?
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/ea-2019-battlegrounds/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/ea-2019-battlegrounds/leaderboard/global</a>
 jacek: btw. did you find some 'hidden' replay of the new contest?
 Gabbek: Error loading Quest Map
 eulerscheZahl: didn't search
 Gabbek: yikes :D
 Gabbek: now I'm getting all kinds of errors
 LastRick: oh boy
 Gabbek: brb ~
 Hjax: more fun if we dont get a replay ahead of time 
 struct: I would stream coding multies or contributions, but my coding skills are not great
 LastRick: better now than in 2 days i guess
 eulerscheZahl: but i reported 2 different ways how i succeeded in the past. both fixed
 eulerscheZahl: i knew about BOTG hero selection before the other players. and groots
 eulerscheZahl: couldn't view it but see the commands and image names
 eulerscheZahl: and scared Illedan so much that he didn't update the game until it was fixed
 eulerscheZahl: fun times
 eulerscheZahl: the forum is a blank page for me now and the homepage just says"Error loading Quest Map"
 eulerscheZahl: is it me?
 Gabbek: nope euler
 Gabbek: same happened to me
 Gabbek: after viewing your link :P
 Gabbek: relogging helped
 eulerscheZahl: strange
 BlaiseEbuth: Buh. The Ubisoft challenge don't want me...&#160;:(
 struct: Yeah I had to login again
 jrke: how to register in that ubisoft challenge
 struct: You probably need an ubisoft emal
 struct: email*
 eulerscheZahl: logout helped, thanks for the hint
 jrke: no there is register button there and it ask to create new cg account
 jrke: no option for login
 struct: There is option for login
 BlaiseEbuth: On top
 eulerscheZahl: that's what you get for clicking random links that a stranger posts on the internet
 jrke: i tried but when logged in it refreshes the page and makes me log out again
 struct: When I open that link I get logged of on here
 Gabbek: I remember pycheckio and sharing pycharm's edu logs
 Gabbek: and being able to delete someone's account&#160;:(
 Gabbek: so scary :D
 eulerscheZahl: another interesting contrib, some of you will recognize it. sadly never released<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6</a>
 jrke: yeah i think there is bug in that page thats why CG didn't provided it openly
 struct: Is this the sound one?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 DomiKo: yes!
 Gabbek: oh, never seen this, looks awesome
 eulerscheZahl: the only point of discussion: creator wanted an optim. while the rest of us said it's a puzzle (easy to reach perfect score)
 eulerscheZahl: then he somehow lost interest&#160;:(
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/498929879">https://www.codingame.com/replay/498929879</a>
 DomiKo: invalid move by Euler
 jrke: gn
 c0d1ngr1ff: hello
 DomiKo: whait what
 DomiKo: that was timeout by me lol
 jrke: how you won after timing out lol
 jacek: everyone failed
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted to spawn as you died
 DomiKo: so i can always timeout and won?
 eulerscheZahl: 9 penguins in total. do we have them yet?no =&gt; keep spawning
 Gabbek: there's so many awesome multis... wait 5 years and I'll be there guys :P
 eulerscheZahl: in 5 years we will at least double the number
 eulerscheZahl: scroll to the bottom, there are release dates<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html</a>
 jrke: then he will say - 'here's so many awesome multis... wait 10 years and I'll be there guys :P'
 Gabbek: I'm spending much less time playing games and doing codingame's puzzles, so there's a chance, hehe&#160;:)
 KUBECZEQ_01: xd?
 DomiKo: i added pushing!
 DomiKo: lets see
 eulerscheZahl: do you push yourself?
 DomiKo: I think no
 eulerscheZahl: top5 was surprisingly easy
 eulerscheZahl: but there's only 1 really strong player
 DomiKo: you?
 DomiKo: xd
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Gabbek: talking about penguins?
 DomiKo: yes
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 jacek: linuxes
 jacek: he could make different distros pushing each other
 Gabbek: *adding penguins to the list of multis I wanna try out*
 struct: People that use transposition tables, do you use unordered map or you have your own implementation?
 struct: for CG?
 jacek: unordered_map. MSmits has own implementation
 jacek: as always
 Gabbek: I mostly used unordered_map, but it's most likely best to look at others&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: in C# smits doesn't even use List&lt;T&gt;he uses List as i recently learned
 eulerscheZahl: he left me in utter disbelief
 jacek: no to generic eh
 Gabbek: started loving one thing that eulerscheZahl shown me - zobrist hashing&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that's another topic
 struct: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo try not to spawn at the edge. makes you vulnerable to pushing
 DomiKo: that could help
 DomiKo: look like I will be top5
 eulerscheZahl: close
 DomiKo: I have big problem, that sometimes my penguins group in one place&#160;:/
 jacek: no homo
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/13/us/gay-penguin-couple-egg-zoo-berlin-trnd/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/13/us/gay-penguin-couple-egg-zoo-berlin-trnd/index.html</a>
 DomiKo: maybe that's why
 jacek: :o
 darkhorse64: @Domiko: searching or bunch of ifs&#160;??
 DomiKo: no search
 DomiKo: my score is pretty intuitive
 DomiKo: right know fitting some parameters
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr at #3 has no search either
 eulerscheZahl: i have a depth 1 only
 eulerscheZahl: tric trac goes much deeper with a cheap scoring
 jacek: ifmax
 Astrobytes: tric-itrax algo
 darkhorse64: I have a greedy bot that avoids being pushed (but fails sometimes, it's buggy) an looks for pushes. I do not optimie harvesting
 darkhorse64: *optimize*
 DomiKo: yea avoiding gives a lot
 darkhorse64: I have been very lazy. Time to work a bit to get back to top 10
 darkhorse64: I want to try a MCTS for n players
 jacek: so NCTS?
 DomiKo: ahhh
 DomiKo: so close 
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: i got it!
 eulerscheZahl: #3. you should stop now
 DomiKo: i have 41% with you
 eulerscheZahl: so i have 59%?
 DomiKo: in that run yes
 eulerscheZahl: then i'm still superior B)
 DomiKo: right now it cg stats says 69% for you
 DomiKo: so i can submit spam
 DomiKo: and get some more points
 DomiKo: I should look at score of opponents I guess
 eulerscheZahl: i still have some obvious flaws when it comes to extending my territory&#160;:(
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: I have some problem with my greedy end game
 DomiKo: when I'm the only player in some spot
 DomiKo: but I have to say
 DomiKo: that is great game
 DomiKo: really fun
 eulerscheZahl: like how is the right one supposed to be better (i'm red)?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/3eY55aF">https://imgur.com/a/3eY55aF</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yes, well chosen from LeRenard
 DomiKo: hmm
 DomiKo: that will be interesting when more players will spend some time here
 eulerscheZahl: it gained &gt; 100 players in a week (puzzle of the week)
 eulerscheZahl: but most didn't try for long
 Gabbek: looks really interesting
 Westicles: The mysterious number shifter hit 700.  Doesn't seem to be slowing down
 eulerscheZahl: a graph problem. but your actions modify it, cutting edges every time
 eulerscheZahl: wow, still going
 eulerscheZahl: and we don't even know if that's with the script or copy-pasting levels by hand
 Westicles: Level 2 guy, he just came here for this I guess
 eulerscheZahl: onboarding and then directly to number shifting
 Westicles: Probably samegame will go the same way, eventually
 eulerscheZahl: so, did he know about the game when creating the account already?
 eulerscheZahl: i think i have a bug in the referee. you can't solve level 1000 as it will try to create the map for 1001 and crash
 eulerscheZahl: so 999 is the max unless i fix it
 Westicles: Give him a year and it will be a hot topic
 trictrac: hello struct back to business, good news&#160;!
 Zenoscave: struct is back?
 struct: Hi trictrac, thanks
 Zenoscave: hi struct o/
 struct: hi Zeno
 Zenoscave: hi trictrac. hi Westicles and eulerscheZahl
 Westicles: hey Zeno
 eulerscheZahl: hi mass pinger
 wlesavo: zeno probably back from celebrating :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: celebrating what? Biden victory?
 Westicles: Mail fraud, and announcing a cure the first working day after?
 trictrac: hi every one
 eulerscheZahl: good evening
 trictrac: struct as discuss with you month ago, I have tried to implement hanabi cooperative game (cf fireworks contribution)
 Zenoscave: I celebrated Biden too
 eulerscheZahl: you can't celebrate that long enough
 Zenoscave: Last week was agonizing in wait. but there's still more to be done. It is official but we still need to wait
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>oh, a date is announced :o
 Zenoscave: on the 21th :laughing:
 eulerscheZahl: st*
 Zenoscave: read the announcement again
 Zenoscave: it says th
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: so, where's the typo? wrong ending or wrong number?
 Zenoscave: That's my point
 eulerscheZahl: 21st is still G contest
 eulerscheZahl: so i go with 24th
 eulerscheZahl: CG*
 Zenoscave: Are you ready for Thurs?
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure if or how hard i will try RAIC
 metahom: in Russian there's no typo. 21
 Zenoscave: good to know. Thanks metahom
 metahom: np
 eulerscheZahl: beta anyways. a few years ago i invented the sandwich in the command and conquer game
 eulerscheZahl: and they added an atomic explosion
 Astrobytes: "a few years ago i invented the sandwich" is my take-home from that
 Westicles: The Earl of Euler
 Zenoscave: how old are you euler? An earl nonetheless  too
 Zenoscave: bah Westicles you stole my joke
 Westicles: heh heh
 Astrobytes: :bread:
 eulerscheZahl: 29
 Zenoscave: Well it's official. My C# Optim is awful
 Zenoscave: 155/159 Legend UTTT
 Zenoscave: Rubbish MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: you had a C++ before. that's a regression for UTTT
 Zenoscave: I was seeing if my C# MCTS would hold up. Prepping for new contest
 Zenoscave: I worked out the kinks in the main code so the optim is as good as it gets
 Astrobytes: GC?
 Illedan: GCTS?
 Zenoscave: garbage collection?
 Zenoscave: is it slow in c#?
 Illedan: yeah
 Astrobytes: Garbage Collecting Tree SEarch... I like it
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Zenoscave: So object reference and handles should be global....
 Zenoscave: well that might help a bit
 Zenoscave: OK this'll be a major rewrite
 darkhorse64: In every language, memory allocation is not compatible with performances
 Zenoscave: or I can do the global node array trick and upfront the alloc
 darkhorse64: ^
 Astrobytes: Advisable
 struct: trictrac and how did it go?
 struct: Hi Illedan I saw your forum message today
 Astrobytes: It's in Contributions struct
 Illedan: Oh, hi struct :D
 Illedan: Where you been at?
 trictrac: 4 players -&gt; 4 rounds of 3 players -&gt; score for 1 player = sum of round he participate
 MasterDuck: How does a clash decide if your code is  "not correct enough"? Like when you pass all the tests, but you don't get 100% score.
 Astrobytes: Validators differ from the test cases
 Astrobytes: (well, they should)
 struct: Hiding, but I'm back
 Astrobytes: So you have to think of edge cases MasterDuck
 struct: It's to prevent hardcoding, but sometimes test cases are not good enough
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: Good job tric
 Astrobytes: It's gonna be an interesting game 
 trictrac: thanks
 MasterDuck: Thanks for answers. 
 Astrobytes: np MasterDuck
 Illedan: Nice&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: The balance is restored to the force now that you're back struct
 AntiSquid: oh yeah saw that RAIC starts when CG fall contest ends
 JBM: OHAI struct
 struct: Hi JBM
 AntiSquid: struct so where have you been?
 Astrobytes: Not here&#160;;)
 struct: Not in jail
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 prison and jail aren't the same right?
 Automaton2000: no dude i have to figure out how to get started
 AntiSquid: ok thanks for confirming
 jacek: AutomatonNN what kind of game for the contest?
 AutomatonNN: What do you mean by the coding skills?
 AntiSquid: so the contest is about coding skills
 Zenoscave: Why were you in jail Struct
 Zenoscave: Too many double rolls?
 struct: I was inocent 
 AntiSquid: unconsensual staring&#160;?
 AntiSquid: did you guys notice the Event Schedule and Resources on the contest page? so much work put into that lol
 struct: I only noticed it at first because page did not load everything at once at first
 struct: Too much to scroll imo
 AntiSquid: yes
 grateful_tomato: big private clash, no bots: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14576942aae272dbe0ceace9f080768ae9a2b50">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14576942aae272dbe0ceace9f080768ae9a2b50</a>
 struct: Automaton2020 join
 struct: Automaton2000 join
 Automaton2000: hm i think i can make the difference between the two
 Astrobytes: Oh I didn't notice all that on the contest page
 Astrobytes: lol, re Curse stream labelled as bitstream :rofl:
 Astrobytes: The meme lives on
 Hjax: ive never asked him about bitstreams 
 Hjax: despite his profile urging me to do so
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'd keep it that way&#160;:)
 Hjax: i take it hes not interested in playing the contest?
 Astrobytes: Not wishing to speak for the man himself but we'll see, if he likes it he might I guess
 jacek: oO
 Hjax: we need a board game contest so jacek will play :P
 AntiSquid: grateful_tomato join here, no bots <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>  
 AntiSquid: then i join your clash
 Astrobytes: They're generally harder though, so not suitable for the CG "Easy to start, hard to master" thingy
 Hjax: codingame fall challenge 2020, chutes and ladders 
 Hjax: easy to start :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: also similar random element to pacman 
 Hjax: im not bitter or anything 
 AntiSquid: rocky identified the witches are from Zelda Orcania, it's a boss one shoots fire one ice
 struct: you can see the fire and ice in their head
 Astrobytes: lol hjax
 struct: in the picture
 Astrobytes: yeah saw that AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: And I only noticed that after Rocky said struct
 jacek: trying to reverse the game rules?
 AntiSquid: i don't see the ice lol
 struct: the talisman
 AntiSquid: always fun part of the contest jacek
 AntiSquid: just a blue gem struct
 struct: that
 struct: gem
 Astrobytes: And Rocky has a good record on contest guessing
 Hjax: after googling it, yeah thats clearly what the picture is referencing 
 AntiSquid: i retroactively done a lot of guesswork too with the contest games
 Astrobytes: Ice &amp; Fire sounds strangely familiar...
 Hjax: i wonder what the games name will be 
 struct: I think Ocean of Code was probably the easiest to figure what it was
 struct: but Im not sure if anyone found it
 Hjax: how to fit a coding pun in, ocarina of time, twinrova, maybe another zelda title 
 AntiSquid: how so struct
 struct: 2 hours before you knew it was a board game IIRC
 struct: we*
 AntiSquid: based on what
 struct: maybe i'm just confused
 Astrobytes: Hjax: Another Code of Ice &amp; Fire  :P
 Hjax: but i skipped that unofficial contest 
 AntiSquid: pacman contest had obvious cover art, although slightly misleading
 Hjax: unfair!
 AntiSquid: XR was immediately guessed as crazy labyrinth game
 Astrobytes: The ARduino of Time
 Astrobytes: Wondev Witches
 Hjax: XD
 Astrobytes: The Ocarina of Line Numbers
 AntiSquid: The Ocarina of NO Time to sleep till Legend
 Astrobytes: On my Swedish mate's stag night we made him play an Ocarina blindfolded and in his underpants in a busy part of Örebro city centre
 Astrobytes: (consensually ofc)
 zapakh: Getting loads of network errors in clash?
 Dan4Life: yh me too
 grateful_tomato: time to turn it off and on again?

 MadKnight: many many people gonna stream it seems
 icecream17: i have no idea what the contest will be about
 jrke: no one has no idea at the moment icecream17
 jrke: 12,410 registered thats huge number
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes that sounds like a story.

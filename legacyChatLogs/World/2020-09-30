 eulerscheZahl: not dying at walls and maybe placing 1 on your own is all you need for lower leagues
 JackTheRipper18: this is weird.
 JackTheRipper18: It's not advancing me, I'm consistently rank 1 in bronze league
 MadKnight: JackTheRipper18 open leaderboard, it says "promotion time: xx...
 JackTheRipper18: ohhh
 MadKnight: u also need to wait until 100% of battles in last battles
 JackTheRipper18: ahh, that's pretty annoying

 codeing: C
 Tiki69: 1 2 3
 Tiki69: ans 14
 Tiki69: pattern?
 codeing: without using atoi
 Q12: Sorry don't know, look in google maybe
 codeing: somebody&#160;?
 Unkmar: So, you are wanting to turn "123" to 123?
 codeing: sure
 codeing: without atoi using
 Tiki69: no 1 2 3array 14 output
 Q12: Look at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7021725/how-to-convert-a-string-to-integer-in-c">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7021725/how-to-convert-a-string-to-integer-in-c</a>
 Unkmar: Without using atoi, do a total from End and multiply by 10 before adding the next digit. 
 Unkmar: I would code it but... I don't really know C.  In other words reverse loop.  3 + 2*10 + 1 * 100;
 Unkmar: of course, you have to handle '3'-48 to get 3.
 Unkmar: or '3'-'0'
 Unkmar: Does that help?
 MadKnight: codeing why doing things in C&#160;?
 codeing: i have to
 MadKnight: yea then just foreach characters
 MadKnight: 11*10+212*10+3
 Unkmar: Well, that stackoverflow link is the most useful info.  Covers some of the issues you might run into.  Example, you didn't mention '-123' or anything similar.

 DomantasZavadskis: is there a way to participate in bot programming game with only friends? Like in clash of code private clash? Or is there a game where you can also have private game with friends? Because clash of code challenges are not the type I'm looking for

 eulerscheZahl: there was another one from orabig but that stopped working
 darkhorse64: Why is sokoban a solo puzzle&#160;? I mean, it could be like NS where you are ranked according to the number of solved levels
 JBM: generating levels is not as easy as NS
 darkhorse64: There are already a lot of existing levels
 JBM: 1) how do you rank them
 JBM: 2) still very finite
 eulerscheZahl: and sokoban is "easy" for humans i think
 eulerscheZahl: while it's hard to come up with an algo
 eulerscheZahl: my solver really struggles as soon as there are a lot of boxes involved. even if it's still obvious to me
 eulerscheZahl: and of course level generation is a relevant point too
 darkhorse64: You picked existing levels don't you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: so many new users with no avatars lately
 eulerscheZahl: i even linked the source of my levels at the bottom
 darkhorse64: @JBM I agree ranking levels is an issue, although the larger, the more difficult. The number of existing levels is quite large ( several thousands at least)
 eulerscheZahl: generating valid levels is easy: start with a solved board and allow pulling rather than pushing
 eulerscheZahl: increasing difficulty will probably be a pain
 darkhorse64: A noob question: what is the difference between a puzzle and a solo game&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: solo: you pass all tests and get 50xp
 eulerscheZahl: no leaderboard
 MadKnight: solo game is turns
 MadKnight: puzzles is input-&gt;answer
 eulerscheZahl: and i opted for relatively easy maps to avoid a 2nd space maze
 darkhorse64: I have no issue with the fact you picked levels
 eulerscheZahl: i decided to mention it anyways :P
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: lol (@ level gen)
 Westicles: All under 160 moves, you should slip a 500 in the validators to mess everybody up
 JBM: yeah, not before half-completion awards are there
 eulerscheZahl: :rofl:
 nxnjitsu: lool
 eulerscheZahl: my solver could do a little more as well. but i don't want the next impossible puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>if you are up for a challenge

 Westicles: 3% success rate.  man...
 eulerscheZahl: was pending for months until it got approved
 darkhorse64: It was before the quests ... Now, it would take only a few days
 JBM: "I like space and henceby approve of this"
 eulerscheZahl: that's what happened in the end: 1 user approving it with 3 accounts
 eulerscheZahl: and not even solving it
 JBM: better 'an refusing, if i'm to believe the "cancer community" rant
 Schwase: quests? really? i was on the contributions page before quests. I think I find it confusing that CG makes the solution available in the contribution. I mean why is the solution visible if CG already checks it with the validators? Are they trying to let people cheat in order to approve a puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: the visible solution is much older than system checks on publishing
 eulerscheZahl: which aren't executed at the moment afaik
 Schwase: yeah that was my guess
 Schwase: oh
 Schwase: they arent?
 Schwase: ive had puzzles stopped because they didnt pass validators
 eulerscheZahl: and CG likes to trust the users. if you are lvl 20+, you are trustworthy enough
 Schwase: and tests
 Schwase: oh you mean that CG should actually check that you solved it?
 Schwase: also, level 20 is easy
 eulerscheZahl: it was harder when they set the limits
 Schwase: i could make one hundred level 20's with a script
 eulerscheZahl: less content that gives you XP
 Schwase: just solve the same classic puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: no free XP clicking on a quest map and such
 Schwase: lol i do love the quest map
 Schwase: except for the harder parts of it
 Schwase: but with no quest map i probably wouldnt try to break 1000 in CoC
 Schwase: im not a programmer, im a physics major who loves math
 eulerscheZahl: story of smits
 Schwase: which is why i struggle with the optimization problems
 Schwase: nah
 Schwase: he's into Comp Sci as well
 Schwase: i code in the main only
 eulerscheZahl: Agade has a PhD in physics too
 Schwase: someone asked me if I know what oop is and for a second i was like no whats oop
 Schwase: object oriented programming ye?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Schwase: ok
 Schwase: i havent made an object since i had no clue how to do a BFS or A* \
 Schwase: and even then
 Schwase: i ended up using an ArrayList code to solve it
 Schwase: i am very glad about it tho
 Schwase: that was a big step on CG for me
 Schwase: that and the use of BigInteger class
 Schwase: although i still havent overcome the last horse-hyperrace duel puzzle just by a small percent
 eulerscheZahl: switch to python. every integer is a big one there
 Schwase: yeah python isnt too complicateed eitehr
 Schwase: and i could maybe win some shortest CoC modes
 Schwase: although i would love to learn ruby
 Schwase: would that be all that hard?
 Schwase: like is ruby brute memorization?
 eulerscheZahl: i never tried to learn ruby. but in the end the concept is mostly the same for those languages anyways. just some syntactic sugar that's different
 eulerscheZahl: there are bigger differences under the hood of course
 eulerscheZahl: but nothing you'll care about when you don't use OOP
 Schwase: yeah i think im not helping myself improve by learning ruby
 Schwase: although i guess learning any new language is always postiive
 eulerscheZahl: stick with java until you've understood OOP
 Schwase: because it can lead to understanding limitations difference etc and features and all that
 eulerscheZahl: one fight at a time
 Schwase: i mean i took AP Comp Sci
 Schwase: i learned oop
 Schwase: but i dont use it
 eulerscheZahl: then start using it&#160;;)
 Schwase: like i could do towers of hanoi
 Schwase: with oop
 eulerscheZahl: i think that's not a good example to use OOP
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. find some maze with path finding
 Schwase: it is a good recursive example
 eulerscheZahl: you have a Board class
 eulerscheZahl: with a Cell[][] grid
 eulerscheZahl: and each cell hasboolean wallCell[] neighbors
 Schwase: ive done a "bugWorld" program
 Schwase: with that structure
 Schwase: so i guess it wouldnt be too bad to try to do it again
 Schwase: i guess mother lost child is the right one to start with?
 Schwase: or whatever its called
 eulerscheZahl: that's one of the many mazes on CG
 Schwase: i guess i typically use flood fill? 
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, breadth first search
 Schwase: where i set the "board" as an int[W][H] and set the start pos to 1
 Schwase: and then each adjacent member to ++
 eulerscheZahl: you want OOP, don't you?
 Schwase: yeah im going to see how other java users solved puzzles that ive also solved
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.codingame.com/direct-puzzle/path-finding">http://www.codingame.com/direct-puzzle/path-finding</a>
 Schwase: oh yes
 Schwase: "learn"
 Schwase: that should have been obvious
 Schwase: thank you euler
 Schwase: i was just using your formula yesterday to solve a physics problem
 Schwase: very interesting stuff
 Schwase:&#160;;)
 Schwase: "It takes around 2 hours to implement it."Did i read that right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but wasn't true for me
 Q12: Are there more learning puzzles like this? and if yes where I can find them?
 Schwase: probably the "learn" tab
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.codingame.com/direct-puzzle/bubble-sort">http://www.codingame.com/direct-puzzle/bubble-sort</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i think that's all the "hidden" puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: they were linked on the forum. i don't know why they were never officially released
 TBali: wow, even explanation video... That was considerable effort to do, yould be nice as  released official puzzle
 TBali: *would
 Q12: I think those puzzles are very helpful. Can you maybe publish them in the Learn tag or publish them somewhere else?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a task for you: annoy Thibaud and make it happen&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: the "learn" part is just tech.io
 eulerscheZahl: a mess to find anything there
 eulerscheZahl: and *I* can't do anything about it. I'm not CodinGame
 TBali: I agree. tech.io would be such nice idea, but not implemented to fully utilize it

 TBali: How I didn't find this thread (last written in 2016&#160;:-)
 Q12: I will ask him to do it in the Forum

 Q12: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: and it's programming with those objects. with some kind of orientation :100:
 Q12: Maybe people can also contribute  Learning puzzles that they make
 Schwase: mind blown
 eulerscheZahl: that contributing happens now. those 2 were way before the codingame SDK was a thing
 eulerscheZahl: so back then only staff could add puzzles with those features (embedded video, interaction, viewer)
 eulerscheZahl: now you are free to create your own content and put it up for approval
 grateful_tomato: is it possible to continue play a Clash of Code problem after it is over?

 sunksuperset370: i put the variable that is set up as the checkpoint's location
 sunksuperset370: but the pod stays where it is
 sunksuperset370: its not a league

 Ma8000: can me someone explain the challange i just had in clash of code
 Majeck: Sure
 Ma8000: It was the game with the buckets and the spilled water. Do you know by any chance?
 Majeck: I think I did it a long time ago... I'll hop into dms
 dark0de: hii
 jacek: back in my days it was called pms
 Ma8000: can someone explain me this code?n,d,s=$&lt;.map &amp;:to_ip d*(n%2+t=n/2)*s*t
 Ma8000: i know some ruby but that crashed my brain
 MadKnight: hey eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Majeck: I don't know ruby but by the looks of it the first line maps the input values to n,d,s and the second line prints d*(n%2 + t = n/2)*s*t, in the parenthesis t is defined as n/2 and adds that to n%2
 Majeck: @Ma8000
 MadKnight: so AntiSquid invited me to the team, eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: we could split
 eulerscheZahl: you+squidme+ille+his colleague
 MadKnight: and i heard u might be a bit worried that i'm gonna do things that annoy u so u don't want me on your team
 MadKnight: but don't worry eulerscheZahl, now i know what annoys u and i won't be doing even close to anything like that
 MadKnight: i will be chill
 MadKnight: actually i didn't even need to know that, as a team player i shouldn't be doing any of that anyway
 AntiSquid: sorry, got ahead of myself there, i wasn't sure we had a 4th
 MadKnight: ohhh it's just 4 people
 MadKnight: rip, Automaton2000
 AntiSquid: ya
 Automaton2000: so it should be the best option
 MadKnight: i'll take all the Automaton's to my team
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 AutomatonNN Automaton2020
 AutomatonNN: *search
 Automaton2000: so that's why i'm asking
 AntiSquid: you get assigned to random team if you don't join any afaik
 MadKnight: or if u press a button saying "Join random"
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, that sounds pretty interesting
 eulerscheZahl: could be anything from great to trash :D
 MadKnight: what exactly&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i like lottery
 MadKnight: oh, random thing
 MadKnight: yea i'm hoping for the best
 eulerscheZahl: had that kind of lottery team at a university coding contest
 AntiSquid: are you joining a random one now? don't mind, just want to know in advance what to expect
 eulerscheZahl: ICPC like
 eulerscheZahl: and we won
 eulerscheZahl: no random for me, i have a team already
 MadKnight:  You are now subscribed to the random queue. You will be assigned to a group at registrations closure and you&#39;ll be notified via-email. 
 eulerscheZahl: i like the ' escaping
 MadKnight: fix your unicode, website
 AntiSquid: hey MadKnight we can do CTF as a team outside reply challenge, there are other contests if you still want to team, still got a lot to learn anyway about CTFs

 AntiSquid: i have a huge list of bookmarked sites too, not sure they are all on ctftime
 MadKnight: oh nice

 AntiSquid: just saved for later
 MadKnight: u wanna do a test one now&#160;?

 MadKnight: anytime soon&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ctftime.org/calendar/">https://ctftime.org/calendar/</a>reply is on the ctftime list too
 AntiSquid: after reply challenge
 eulerscheZahl: go to the "Agenda" view at the top right
 AntiSquid: right now i am splitting up time between some ctf practice and the book i linked you MadKnight
 MadKnight: no i mean trying any simple past ctf for practice before reply

 eulerscheZahl: yellow to you as well PatrickMcGinnisII
 MadKnight: oh, puzzles
 AntiSquid: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: always room for jello
 PatrickMcGinnisII: even yellow jello
 AntiSquid: i get it you want to have a conversation to improve your english but i don't have time atm
 AntiSquid: are you interested in a discord server with lots of users MadKnight?
 MadKnight: what kind of users&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i put a new cpu cooler, another 8gb of memory, and moved my OS to a SSD ... but I still feell like my vid card is being hacked thru CG
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't notice the slowdowns anymore, that's how its related
 AntiSquid: it's just random chat mostly, but they have voice channels so i guess it's good&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: for improving speech i mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i got penguins running, what's the simplest way to get out of wood3?
 jacek: move to the hex with mos fish
 PatrickMcGinnisII: doing that
 jacek: good for you

 PatrickMcGinnisII: now if penguins could shoot fish
 SpaghettiCode: damn playing clash of code makes me feel so dumb
 Majeck: Yeah, but when you get in a streak you feel like a literal god hahaha
 Majeck: The highs totally make up for the lows
 SpaghettiCode: for me there aren't any highs lol
 vladov200: So how long does it take you to complete a problem?
 vladov200: I feel it takes me a long time
 Majeck: Which problems: Clash of Code or the regular puzzles?
 vladov200: Regular puzzles
 Majeck: Back in the day the easy/medium puzzles each took me at least a few days to complete
 Majeck: And I always overengineered them to the point of absurdity
 Majeck: Just yesterday for example I found a 400 line C# script that I redid in a 100 lines 
 vladov200: How did you manage to cut down on time?
 vladov200: Practice?
 Majeck: Experience I guess
 Majeck: I mean you always feel stupid after seeing the correct answer but in general in life it takes you 10x more time to come up with the answer from scratch than to do it again
 Majeck: So of course you can feel you wasted to much time in an 80 line program that does a really basic thing, but hey, you did it and you probably know how to do it faster next time
 Majeck: *too
 Majeck: Also if you feel stuck writing what you want to do in paper, or just taking a break to let your mind think can be a godsend
 vladov200: Thanks for the feedback, I agree with stepping away when things aren't going your way. Usually, the solution comes to me when I'm out doing something else.
 Noisestorm: Like pooping
 Majeck: More than once I've come up with the solution at 3AM after being woken up
 Majeck: And being like "That's so simple, how did you not come up with that earlier"
 Majeck: Or "I'm a goddamn genius, I should get a nobel prize in smarts"
 SpaghettiCode: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i won a Nobel prize
 Majeck: In real life?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Majeck: Woahhhhh

 Astrobytes: Yeah, I usually have to refamiliarise myself a little bit before I delve into his videos. He's great though.
 Hjax: my favorites are the ones that present well researched video essays on just completely random topics 
 Astrobytes: Yep, agreed. Not too hard to sort the wheat from the chaff if you know what you're after
 Hjax: like Tom Scott or CGP Grey
 Astrobytes: I know Tom Scott but not the other one
 Hjax: oh really? CGP Grey is probably my #1 favorite youtube channel 
 Hjax: you should definitely check him out 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: red pen black pen
 Majeck: Wow, CGP Grey is one of the greats
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap,  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/blackpenredpen">https://www.youtube.com/user/blackpenredpen</a>
 Astrobytes: I've mostly been checking out the poor standard of guitar youtubers recently
 Majeck: Can't believe someone hasn't seen them
 Astrobytes: Majeck, tbc I know the name, just not the videos
 Hjax: his videos range from self help topics on productivity, to the history of tumbleweeds, to philosophical storytelling 
 Astrobytes: I've always been of the opinion that if you are watching a video on productivity you're doing it wrong
 Hjax: his videos take a unique spin on it 
 Astrobytes: Take that with a large pinch of salt and a tongue in a cheek
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TinaS/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/TinaS/videos</a>
 Hjax: he has one called "7 Ways to Maximize Misery" 
 Hjax: my favorite video of his is probably Humans Need Not Apply
 Astrobytes: I can maximise my misery with zero to little effort. Meh
 Hjax: a video essay on the future of automation 
 Astrobytes: That is admittedly a topic worth discussing
 Hjax: The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant is also fantastic 
 Astrobytes: that's an old one
 Hjax: yeah that video is him telling an existing story, with his own animation style 
 Hjax: he is really pleasing to listen to in general imo
 Astrobytes: Hm. See this is where I start to ask the question "how many times can you tell the same story" - but, if it reaches a new audience in an engaging manner, who am I to complain
 Hjax: i hadnt heard it before his video 
 Hjax: he has a video explaining all of the different ways you can subdivide the UK, and the history of it 
 Hjax: i think that was one of his first videos 
 Astrobytes: Touchy subject for a Scot :P
 Hjax: :D 
 Majeck: My favourite CGP Grey video is americapox definitely
 Hjax: thats also a good one 
 Hjax: who am i kidding, everything on his channel is good 
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I gotta run. Should be on a lot more from next week.Nice chatting as always, gn all and thanks for the recommendations&#160;;)

 Majeck: Oh, in the level system hahaha, sorry I've been away for a while
 mortadha: i don't understand what you write
 Majeck: I don't know how to help you level up in algorithms sorry
 mortadha: ok thanks
 Uljahn: so taking a course or reading a book on algorithms and data structures isn't an option? you need some magic spell?
 JBM: ALOFLIPENDO
 Hjax: im a big fan of trial and error when learning algorithms 
 Hjax: read about it, get some understanding 
 Hjax: try to implement it, get stuck, and correct your understanding as you go
 Hjax: the "ah ha" moment when you realize what mistake you made in your first attempts is really valuable for learning in my opinion 
 JBM: agreed

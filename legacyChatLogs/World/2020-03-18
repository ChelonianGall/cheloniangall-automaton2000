 Elioh: anyone here good at both python and java&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: just ask your question and find out if we are good enough
 Elioh: hahahaha true
 Elioh: i am studying java for an entrance exam into a company :p
 Elioh: wanted to see if anyone has any tips for the switch between the languages
 Uljahn: i don't know java very well but often can rewrite java to python just by deleting "unnecessary" things :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: but deleting is easier than adding to go in the opposite direction :P
 amurushkin: I think i see somewhere like a tips to rewrite the code between languages but the best way on my opinion is to know the both
 Uljahn: sure thing
 Elioh: yeah im gonna start practicing it from 0

 kovi: was there any change in BandC validators?
 kovi: few days ago the first few submissions of my new code gave 2x304. but since i rarely get below 310
 anid: Have any of you guys written IOI?
 dbdr: kovi: I don't know
 dbdr: wlesavo: are you there?
 wlesavo: here
 wlesavo: hi
 dbdr: hi!
 dbdr: see kovi's question above
 wlesavo: no, didnt change a thing
 wlesavo: would do so without discussing here anyway
 wlesavo: wouldnt*
 wlesavo: kovi i guess this is why dbdr was wondering if you are doing anything fancy :slight_smile:
 dbdr: wlesavo why aren't you at 100%?&#160;;)
 wlesavo: because im bad at programming :slight_smile: 
 dbdr: good enough to make contributions
 wlesavo: im getting a lot of fan recently on hard and very hard puzzles but cant optimize BC
 dbdr: but yeah, that's different skills
 dbdr: definitely harder in python
 dbdr: you must know Java, that would be much faster
 wlesavo: yeah, i tried to vectorize my code with numpy, but still cant generate initial pool fast enough
 dbdr: top 9 is C/C++/Rust
 dbdr: then Python and Ruby :D
 wlesavo: i think what  we really should do is decide the tie between 2-3-4 :slight_smile:
 dbdr: I think CG is doing the right thing: display ranked by submit time, but equal CPs
 dbdr: that said, good if someone improves&#160;:)
 wlesavo: well that makes sense
 dbdr: for years it was the (wrong) opposite: random ranking changing over time and which gave different CPs :D
 dbdr: I guess they could still improve. Print:
 dbdr: 2""5
 dbdr: instead of: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb0fc15e-d3c6-44ba-8d84-be58c735efff">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb0fc15e-d3c6-44ba-8d84-be58c735efff</a>
 wlesavo: oh really? it was random?
 dbdr: yeah. I think they just used sort on the score
 wlesavo: as for me ill probably stick to some suboptimal strategy and will be happy with just 100% :slight_smile:
 dbdr: I'm not even sure how to do it suboptimally
 dbdr: do you?
 wlesavo: yeah, after finding all digits you can just swap 2 of them and see if this increases bulls count, smth like that, or eulers rotating tail strategy 
 dbdr: some, some kind of hill cimbing should work
 dbdr: climbing
 wlesavo: also when you definitely know 4 digits you can implement same strategy as before
 dbdr: generate all combinations?
 wlesavo: yeah
 dbdr: right. won't work with N=10 :D
 wlesavo: that works for me in 50 ms for length 6
 dbdr: yay for exponentials&#160;:)
 wlesavo: cant get below 10s for L=10 though 
 dbdr: N = 10 =&gt; 3265920 possible guesses found in 153.6ms
 wlesavo: dbdr what do you use to generate guesses? standard tools, couple of loops or something really different?
 dbdr: a recursive function that fills a vector
 ThienPhu: hello idol
 wlesavo: seems slow for python, hm
 wlesavo: easy to implement though

 qlorg: Hi
 Iuseqingreen: hi everyone)
 The-White-Fang: hey, so i'm a little lost on this puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/short-accounts-make-long-friends">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/short-accounts-make-long-friends</a> if someone could explain or guide me to the right direction, I'll be really thankful
 struct: Trying all combos is not enough?=
 Scarfield: You can add/subtract/multiply and or divide the numbers given, to try and reach the expected result, what are you in doubt of The-White-Fang?
 Scarfield: OutputLine 1: POSSIBLE or IMPOSSIBLE whether the operation is possible or notLine 2: min distance from result if the expected result is impossible to obtain or minimal number of operations if the expected result is possible to achieve
 Scarfield: Msmits; for the smitsi UCB calc, is the scale parameter really necessary? wouldnt it be enough to fit the exploration parameter according to the range of ones score range?
 struct: He doesnt use the it anymore
 Scarfield: yea thought i remembered that is what he mentioned he changed, but i cant remember what he does instead :p
 struct: He didnt exactly say
 struct: but he also said that he can share it
 Scarfield: it seems to me, that fitting the exploration param would yield the same? 
 struct: I think so
 struct: but in some games you might need to ajust it depending on turn
 struct: Also depends on eval
 struct: on CSB it would make no sence to not change exploration parameter
 Scarfield: noice ty, hopefully i can start testing the search tomorrow&#160;:) hows your smitsi going?
 struct: just starting now
 Scarfield: gl :muscle:
 struct: also I need to ask him
 struct: if he has different exploration parameter
 struct: based on pod
 Scarfield: hmm didnt think of that, could be the blocker would benefit from exploring more/less. Good idea&#160;:)
 Scarfield: I will try without assigning a role for the pods initially, and hopefully the roles will emerge from the search, but its possibly a bad idea 
 struct: I think it should
 struct: Never asked m smits
 MSmits: i dont 
 MSmits: but it's not a bad idea.... there are many things I never tried
 Scarfield: i suppose it matters more if there are other pods close to one of your pods. If one of your pods has both enemy pods close, it would probably benefit from more exploration
 MSmits: hard to define "closé". If your search has a depth of 7, anything could be close at some point
 Scarfield: well, the more likely a collision is, the less certain the search is i mean
 Scarfield: btw, cant you neglect the scaleParam and instead fit the explorationParam for the range of your eval score MSmits?
 Scarfield: in smitsi that is
 MSmits: of course, I said this twice on chat over the last few days :P
 MSmits: rambled on about it for half an hour one time :P
 MSmits: I dont have a scale parameter anymore
 Scarfield: I have been raiding in Escape from Tarkov way too much lately :p
 MSmits: it's too slow
 struct: do you have different exploration param per pod
 struct:&#160;?
 MSmits: I thought I put this in my article. Didnt do a rewrite, just a comment
 MSmits: no
 Scarfield: 2 sec
 MSmits: both pods will have a similar score range
 MSmits: so i didnt bother to fit them separately
 MSmits: btw, you can also have pods share a single node
 MSmits: then you'd have 10-20 moves on expansion
 MSmits: if you prune properly that is
 struct: but does your exploration param change throughout the game?
 Scarfield: hmm i dont see any comment about it, but you mention Robo suggested a random rollout 
 MSmits: i dont use that way, but I've heard it being used before
 MSmits: my version uses a random rollout, to make sure each rollout goes to depth 7
 MSmits: the first few expansions it doesnt go deep enough otherwise
 MSmits: it barely matters though
 MSmits: without the random rollout it performed almost the same
 MSmits: struct, it does not change
 Scarfield: "NOTE: I have changed my CSB bot to no longer use the lowestscore/highestscore normalization method as it was kind of heavy. It makes sense to start with something like this though."
 struct: ok so i have no clue what you do
 MSmits: yes, it makes sense because you then dont need to fit it in a reasonable range
 struct: but wait
 Scarfield: ah you did, just scrolled to the part i needed, read it a few times by now&#160;:)
 struct: So its in your eval
 MSmits: without scaling, your exploration param could be anything
 MSmits: will be very hard to guess a good value without scaling
 struct: I cant use Magu s eval on CSB for runner
 MSmits: not sure what that is
 struct: and not change exploration param if I dont have the scale
 MSmits: you dont need scale
 struct: return checked*50000 - this.distance(this.checkpoint());
 MSmits: ok do it like this
 MSmits: pick any exploration param
 MSmits: finish bot
 MSmits: out put the first child nodes you can choose as moves
 MSmits: if they have all visits on 1 node, your exp par is too small
 MSmits: if all nodes have the same amount of visits, your exp par is too large
 MSmits: get somewhere between those extremes and do a proper fit later
 struct: But example
 struct: on magu s eval
 struct: the further the game goes
 struct: the bigger is the score
 MSmits: doesnt matter
 MSmits: ok, you've played uttt right?
 MSmits: I an use it as an example
 struct: yes
 MSmits: can
 MSmits: what are you loss and win scores
 MSmits: -1 and 1?
 MSmits: or 0 and 1?
 MSmits: I need to know to give an example
 struct: let me check
 struct: cant recall
 MSmits: doesnt matter
 MSmits: just pick one
 MSmits: no need to go check
 struct: -1 1
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: so 
 MSmits: what will happen to your bot if you changed that to 
 MSmits: 12456 and 12458
 Scarfield: My thinking was: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9b0b5e4c-6cf9-4d32-bff8-f4b2a246fcd9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9b0b5e4c-6cf9-4d32-bff8-f4b2a246fcd9</a>
 MSmits: for loss and win
 struct: if i didint change exploration?
 MSmits: well maybe not quite that large due to floating point precision, but say you have 123 and 125
 MSmits: yes struct
 MSmits: if you kept exploration the same
 struct: i guess it would explore a lot more?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: it will play exactly the same
 MSmits: the differences in average score between two child nodes will be the same
 MSmits: a child that always wins has 125
 MSmits: a child that always loses has 123
 MSmits: so the value term in UCB1 has the same difference
 MSmits: between the two children
 MSmits: so selection is unaffected
 struct: I see
 MSmits: so you see now why it matters not that you use magus eval?
 struct: But what does exploration param do then?
 MSmits: the fact that you are late in the game is a score bonus for every node
 struct: allow to explore more?
 MSmits: it affects the ratio between the value term and the exploration term
 MSmits: i should say value term differences 
 MSmits: the spread
 MSmits: with a larger exploration parameter, visits begin to matter more
 MSmits: let me do another example
 MSmits: ok so you have -1 and +1 for uttt
 MSmits: what would change about your bot if you changed that to -100 and +100
 Scarfield: its a balance value, to make your terms in perfect balance, as all things should be...
 MSmits: and you made your exploration parameter 10x as high
 MSmits: 100x sorry
 MSmits: say it was 1.3 before, it is now 130
 MSmits: -100 loss, +100 win, 130 exploration parameter
 MSmits: it would be exactly the same bot
 Scarfield: isnt it the range of the score, more than the score "value"&#160;?
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: the range of scores among the children
 Scarfield: noice, i think i got it :D
 MSmits: it pays to really look mathematically at the ucb1 formula
 struct: Ok I need to test this
 Scarfield: yea, and realise that its comparing the different UCBs and not only one UCB result that matters
 MSmits: ok so do two things. 1) Multiply loss score, win score and exp param by the same amount
 MSmits: and 2) add a fixed score to both loss and win and keep exp par the same
 MSmits: both those two experiments should do nothing
 MSmits: right Scarfield
 struct: Multiply by what?
 MSmits: a positive number
 MSmits: say, 10
 MSmits: so win = 10, loss = 10, exp param is 10x what it was
 MSmits: loss = -10
 kingofnumbers: MSmits I see that you are very active on this chat :D 
 Scarfield: in completely different news: i searched for your article earlier, and one of the google results was something like "Jimmy Smits: IMAX ... " xD
 MSmits: kingofnumbers you see correctly&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol 
 kingofnumbers: what's the reason? 
 struct: my exploration param is 1 in UTTT
 MSmits: that i am active?
 struct: why do I even have it
 struct: lol
 AntiSquid: actually MSmits has 6 siblings, that's why kingofnumbers
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: yes we use UCB1 to pick who has chat duty
 kingofnumbers: yes, that you're active
 kingofnumbers: a messaged in red means it's private? 
 MSmits: well I like talking about this stuff I suppose
 MSmits: no 
 MSmits: it means they talk to you
 AntiSquid: red = hot
 MSmits: type msm and press tab
 Scarfield: kingofnumbers it means your name was mentioned
 kingofnumbers: MSmits hello 
 MSmits: the name will finish and it will ping
 MSmits: yeah like that
 kingofnumbers: so if first word is nickname it will appear red? 
 MSmits: no, any word
 MSmits: lool: kingofnumbers
 MSmits: look
 MSmits: it always works
 AntiSquid: it will also send a loud and annoying ping to the user you mention and alert them you are demanding an immediate response
 kingofnumbers: so if my nickname in the message it will appear red? 
 MSmits: you can also ping Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: there was a lot more than i do
 MSmits: to you yes kingofnumbers
 kingofnumbers: were you guys talking about reinforcement learning stuff? 
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 i'm thinking to kick you so you can self-isolate
 Automaton2000: but i wanted to test it
 MSmits: kingofnumbers nope
 MSmits: just the ucb1 formula used in mcts and other things
 MSmits: but people talk about machine learning here often
 kingofnumbers: aha
 kingofnumbers: what is mcts&#160;? 
 Scarfield: monte carlo tree search
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search</a>
 kingofnumbers: cool
 MSmits: used often in AI for board games
 MSmits: sometimes combined with machine learning
 kingofnumbers: I think this is very relevant to reinforcement learning  
 MSmits: sure yes
 MSmits: I need to grade tests =/ 
 MSmits: One problem with working solely from home is that you can always work
 MSmits: have to know when to decide to relax and do something else
 struct: cant you just keep your usual work schedule
 MSmits: I think i should work on  my Onitama bot now
 MSmits: I didnt have much of a schedule to begin with, but over half the work i did at my school and i graded tests in the train
 MSmits: both those things are different now. Need to find a new balance
 eulerscheZahl: onitama sounds good
 MSmits: yeah, I figured out how to code a bitboard. It's all in my head. Now I need to type it up
 MSmits: and cause lots of bugs
 kingofnumbers: MSmits are you active in competitive programming like codeforces etc? 
 MSmits: not like codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: not writing a simple bot first and extend it slowly (eval changes might be faster without bitboards)you do all at once :D
 kingofnumbers: so only AI stuff? 
 eulerscheZahl: faster to implement i mean
 eulerscheZahl: he's not on codeforces
 MSmits: it's not that much harder to do a bitboard since I am used to it now, but i got stuck on 1 thing
 MSmits: I always start like this: I do one expansion (of the root) and apply a random child move, remember the tree between turns
 MSmits: thats the perfect test of the sim
 MSmits: and the bitboard is confined to the sim
 MSmits: so if that works, then it's all fine
 MSmits: i said that wrong, i mean i expand once, print the result after the move and check if its the same as the actual game state
 MSmits: do it for a whole game, every turn
 MSmits: the rest of the bot is not much work, i just steal it from a different mcts bot
 MSmits: kingofnumbers yeah, we have many multiplayer arena's and sometimes we have a 10 day contest
 darkhorse64: MSmits: I feel like you are reading my code over my shoulder
 MSmits: you and I do almost the same thing I think.
 MSmits: some small differences
 darkhorse64: You hacker&#160;!
 MSmits: what you said about your idea for onitama was also in my head
 AntiSquid: he also reads your love letters, he posted them in chat the other day
 MSmits: i just couldnt figure out how to do the cards
 MSmits: lol AntiSquid
 darkhorse64: I still need to code the lookup for card moves. Despite the lockup, I have been very busy lately
 MSmits: yeah the lockup keeps me busier than I thought it would also
 MSmits: i bet we'll both kick trictrac off nr 1
 MSmits: well down to 3  I mean
 MSmits: from what I read you're going to do the exact same bot I am
 MSmits: I am thinking about eval vs random rollouts though
 MSmits: seems there are few features you can use for early playout termination
 MSmits: also games will be shorter so..
 eulerscheZahl: trictrac and jacek are both pretty strong
 MSmits: yes, but I can beat them both with sheer arrogance and overconfidence
 darkhorse64: That's the goal. It will be true only if Onitama is not a trap game
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by trap&#160;?
 MSmits: narrow lines of play that lead to a different result than the average result from nearby branches
 MSmits: so an "average" game state does not apply
 darkhorse64: typing too fast for me. +1
 MSmits: and you can't value nodes properly
 struct: by trap he means yavalath
 darkhorse64: Very good example where the random rollouts leads nowhere
 MSmits: might be true for onitama also
 MSmits: however, early playout termination should have no weaknesses compared to minimax should it?
 MSmits: you just need a good eval
 MSmits: like minimax
 MSmits: not that that is easy
 MSmits: all I can think of is number of live warriors
 MSmits: maybe nearness of master to opponent shrine, but with weird card jumps that could be meaningless
 MSmits: help us out here eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 MSmits: pretty sure you thought this through
 eulerscheZahl: closeness of your units
 MSmits: is it good to have them close?
 eulerscheZahl: if 1 gets captured, you can fight back
 MSmits: do you look at the cards for this?
 darkhorse64: Another feature is number of possible moves
 eulerscheZahl: personally i don'tbut my bot is bad
 MSmits: could just be performance, or did you c++ this?
 darkhorse64: If a piece is close to the rim, it has less freedom
 eulerscheZahl: number of possible moves is a good one i think
 eulerscheZahl: (i don't do it)
 MSmits: i would say threatened squares
 MSmits: which is almost the same as movement freedom
 MSmits: except you count two pieces threatening the same square as 1
 eulerscheZahl: protected units
 MSmits: plenty of ideas to try
 MSmits: give me a week to get this to work though. As you said, i do it all at once 
 darkhorse64: First reach 1 M sims, after we can talk
 MSmits: 1M... euler didnt give us a 1s start
 darkhorse64: Really&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: you always have 1s
 MSmits: really&#160;!?
 eulerscheZahl: i can't even do anything to prevent it, if i want
 MSmits: ohh
 eulerscheZahl: setup time for slower languages
 MSmits: thats good to know
 eulerscheZahl: some really need itthere isn't a single game on CG without that 1s
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: so i was too lazy to explicitly mention it
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: about the 1s I mean, not you being lazy
 struct: but can you make it 2 sec?
 darkhorse64: Great, compute the game to the end. That makes me think that some cards decks lead to a forced win. That's another good test to run
 MSmits: trictrac did that
 MSmits: euler blacklisted card combos that were easily solvable
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, could you expand the blacklist further if I happen to solve more?
 darkhorse64: Don't tell&#160;!
 karliso: onitama has 1s for 1st move?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: darkhorse64 there are 300k + combos
 eulerscheZahl: there was a post on boardgame geeks about the blacklist too
 MSmits: oh
 eulerscheZahl: some games can be solved in 6 turns (these are excluded)
 MSmits: but what if one can be solved in 10?
 eulerscheZahl: seems that there are no further solved games with up to 8 turns
 eulerscheZahl: or even 10, i don't remember
 MSmits: ah ok
 darkhorse64: I mean check a few blacklisted combos against your engine as a test 
 MSmits: well if someone did good research on this, i dont have to
 AntiSquid: karliso what's your secret sauce?
 karliso: Ask MSmits a lot of questions.
 MSmits: he did do that&#160;:)
 MSmits: and now I am nr 2 uttt
 AntiSquid: brain draining MSmits :thinking:
 MSmits: it's amazing how fast karliso learns
 AntiSquid: using MSmits as open book :thinking:

 MSmits: 300k+ makes it impossible to add an opening book
 eulerscheZahl: i know&#160;:)
 MSmits: so it doesnt matter if people can solve it locally
 MSmits: I can probably find many combinations i can solve locally, but not in 1s 
 MSmits: if i do, i will let you know
 eulerscheZahl: i was very well aware of how hard it will be to add an opening book, when i decided to create the game :imp:
 MSmits: yeah, it's good
 MSmits: I dont need all games to be book-able
 MSmits: I can only run 1 meta mcts at once&#160;:)
 struct: how many cores you use?
 MSmits: just 1, i have a quad core pc, but I want to be able to do other stuff on it
 MSmits: I sometimes ran two meta mcts
 MSmits: but I paused yavalath
 darkhorse64: Change the priority
 MSmits: It would make a lot of sense to do one for oware and checkers
 MSmits: but checkers doesnt motivate me and oware.... meh at some point maybe
 MSmits: for breakthrough it is almost impossible I think
 MSmits: you can make an openin book that is really good vs yourself, but if you play against someone who uses a different strategy it becomes useless
 Ciomegu: hory shit I am a terrible programmer 
 icecream17: It's 3:14 pm, awesome
 didyme: Ciomegu, I say the same thing about every hour
 AntiSquid: Ciomegu no need to brag about it
 struct: Automaton2000 how are you?
 Automaton2000: you are still in the same order
 elderlybeginner: any hints for puzzle of the week?
 JBM: what *is* the puzzle of the week?
 Uljahn: brute force it, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and if it's a problem with it
 elderlybeginner: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gezkisX.png">https://imgur.com/gezkisX.png</a>found in in notifications
 Uljahn: JBM just solve all the puzzles and one of them should be it :smiley:
 elderlybeginner: what's Automation2000? :grin:
 Uljahn: you mean Automaton2000? :wink:
 Automaton2000: u need to pass the validators
 Scarfield: Automaton is a chat bot
 Uljahn: also use tab to autocomplete long nicks
 Scarfield: In the puzzle you need to see if you can reach the target result with doing the allowed operations (+, -, *, /) on the given numbers
 elderlybeginner: yep, any other strategy for that puzzle beside brute force?
 Scarfield: if you can, output possible, and the number of operations needed, if not, output impossible, and the difference between the target number, and the closests number you can reach - so as mentioned, bruteforce is the way
 Uljahn: doing brute force in python could lead to timeouts though
 Scarfield: hmm, dont think so, but have only read the description, havent looked at it more than that
 Uljahn: me too
 Scarfield: isnt there a full second available for puzzles?
 elderlybeginner: there are 14 numbers available, 6 places, then you have combination 6 out of 14, and additional combination or permutation for operators. It seems to me that it makes a lot of computing
 JBM: Uljahn: already did&#160;:(
 Scarfield: oh there is a constraint i didnt notice, there is only a few possible numbers you can get as input, not all from 1 to 100, so there might be some strategy from that, also the target is less than 1000, so that also limits a lot
 struct: some puzles even get more time
 struct: based on language
 struct: I think one has 5 sec for javascript
 struct: you can brutte force that puzzle in javascript
 struct: but not on c++
 struct: Dont know if this applies to all puzzles
 elderlybeginner: second example looks like there is a cue in it, however I cannot see it :shrugging_man:
 Scarfield: with one number you can do 4 operations with any of the remaining 5. 4 * 5 = 20.Then 4 operations with that result with the remaining 4 numbers, and so on.. Then if the result can be reached without using up all numbers given, you need to start with all six, which should mean:(4*5)*(4*4)*(4*3)*(4*2)*(4*1)*6 = 737.280 permutations
 Scarfield: that should be doable in python i think&#160;:)
 struct: hmmm
 struct: depends on time I guess
 elderlybeginner: this does not include operations on results of the first operations
 Scarfield: yes, thats why the parenthases are multiplied as well
 struct: also the number wont be that big
 struct: since if negative
 struct: you can ignore
 struct: at least is what I understood from the quick read
 Scarfield: Only subtractions resulting in a positive number are considered.Only divisions resulting in an integer are considered. yea there is some constraints on that as well
 elderlybeginner: it should be combination in parenthasis then, (C(6,2))
 elderlybeginner: or permutation if the numbers can be repeated - no info about that
 Scarfield: that actually isnt mentioned, but it seems implied that one number can only be used once
 Scarfield: if numbers can be repeated it should be (4*6)^6 which i doubt
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: where did the challenge go
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: can someone link?
 struct: it is in 50 days
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: the weekly puzzle

 NoiselessKnight_28b2: thx
 jiniiii: hi
 HMu0510: hi
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: hi~
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: hi
 icecream17: hi
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: anyone know why all the validators for this weeks puzzle pass except for the last one? Anyone solve this?
 syoon: it's bug
 icecream17: weeks puzzle is hard. i'm still trying to figure out how not to use too much brute force
 icecream17: but with only 27 lines of code a heap already ran out of memory

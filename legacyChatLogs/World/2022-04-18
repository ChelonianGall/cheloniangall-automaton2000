 Shazbaz: If I leave this and go to another game, will I still be able to view my final code later?
 5DN1L: If you have played your code once or submitted your code, the code will remain there
 Nik05: It will save your last tried or submitted code
 Shazbaz: cool :sunglasses:
 Nik05: You can also publish a solution
 Shazbaz: I figured it probably would, but still wanted to check first
 Nik05: Oh right, it will save all submitted solutions
 Shazbaz: Publish a solution?
 Nik05: Then other people can see your code as well

 ZndrBrok: Hi guys, for the CoC event, it's only one clash/round&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: I just tried the C# one from 12.00 and i was thinking it's more than just one "fight"
 Shazbaz: Is CoC not something that runs all the time?

 Passifi: I can already tell you it doesn't anything fancy a handful if else statements did the trick for me
 VizGhar: 40 LOC in kotlin / java... I've used the java.awt.Recangle so that I don't have to compute intersection function manually
 Shazbaz: I'm trying to make it work with recursive calls. Is this the wrong approach? I'm running into unexpected difficulties.
 Shazbaz: Also, I'm currently working in C++
 Alex4545: :dev
 Nik05: Shazbaz you can probably recurse
 Nik05: If you have a tail call, you can always transform it into a loop if your language does optimize it
 Uljahn: recursion is a total overkill for that puzzle
 Nik05: oh right, you are still need an input from the game loop
 Darleanow: Hey evvery1&#160;!
 Nik05: hey Darleanow
 Nik05: what puzzle are you doing?
 Darleanow: nothing atm
 Darleanow: i'm helping a streamer lel&#160;:)
 Darleanow: Hey Nik05
 Darleanow: how r u tho&#160;?
 Nik05: What is the streamer doing?

 Darleanow: horses*
 Darleanow: me too&#160;:)
 MickeyMoise: can anyone help me with an issue on "The Fall - Epsiode 1"? I tested the program i wrote in a separate IDE and it was outputting the correct stuff, but when i play the testcase in codingame, it shows smth completely different
 MickeyMoise: i;ve been stuck on this for the past hour and i just cant figure it out, seems so simple yet i just dont understand whats wrong
 DaNinja: all test cases fail?
 MickeyMoise: the first one works
 MickeyMoise: on the second one, on the second step, it tells me that my guess is wrong, yet when i put it in the IDE it gives me the correct one
 DaNinja: whats your code for room type 11?
 nichromat: I solved the code. But i think it is not that well done 
 MickeyMoise: well, none, if it tells me the position of Indy and the direction he is coming from, shouldnt i just add 1 to the y axis if its from the top, add 1 to the x axis if he is coming from the left and subtract 1 if he is coming from the right?
 MickeyMoise: and then output x and y?
 DaNinja: room type 11 should move him to the right always
 MickeyMoise: so i need to do all the cases for all the rooms?
 DaNinja: yes
 MickeyMoise: and i take the room type from that string called "line"
 DaNinja: for 2,4,5,6 the direction depends on which side he is coming from
 DaNinja: yes, save it in a grid
 MickeyMoise: and then when i go through the grid i need to check the room type and the direction?
 DaNinja: yep
 MickeyMoise: how many lines did it take you?&#160;:))
 DaNinja: 20 lines c++
 MickeyMoise: huh, ok
 MickeyMoise: thanks for the clarifications
 DaNinja: np
 Maccas: hey friendos!

 xxd: reported
 xxd: kidding
 dmin: is it possible for someone to look at my current clash solution afterwards?
 dmin: I couldnt find a solution in the allotted 15 mins. It's in java
 michaellan: what language
 dmin: java
 michaellan: ah my bad didnt see ur comment
 dmin: all good it was kinda hidden
 xxd: try sending a link to the clash
 dmin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1913415bbb890e6514378364f6b873ab081421e">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1913415bbb890e6514378364f6b873ab081421e</a>
 xxd: cant see code, oops
 dmin: i really tried to brute it 
 xxd: whats the problem statement
 dmin: take a string like "1+3+2" and return it as "1+2+3"
 xxd: i.e., sort the numbers in between the + signs?
 dmin: correct 
 xxd: put your code on a pastebin and PM it to me
 maazshakeel: Hi
 dmin: heya
 holite: guys can you joint his clash and help me

 xxd: please stop
 holite: ok sorry 
 holite: hey stop i realize my mistake opls do not send clash link 
 holite: and xxd they why have you nt submitted it 
 holite: even i have the solution
 xxd: because its shortest mode you doofus
 xxd: holite is harassing me in DMs
 Westicles: That's what you get for talking to plebs
 xxd: sorry westicles :pensive:
 xxd: that was a garbage problem, bad validators
 juice0: that was not the thrashing i'd hoped for.  oh well, at least the troll couldn't have done any worse.
 xxd: that was an anomaly in my performance, trust me
 xxd: there were literally no constraint details in the problem statement
 juice0: i believe you
 xxd: cant believe i got trolled from some guy who "have contacts with best coders  i have not ime to speak with you imediatley comman dto realsize  me or un ban me"

 xxd: no
 xxd: no god please no
 juice0: lol
 xxd: J[]HN_WICK is this guy's alt
 xxd: wait wtf
 xxd: this guy is giving me bad luck
 xxd: clash is for donks anyway
 juice0: yep quit donking around.  how's the progress on top 2% in bot programming?
 xxd: got that one
 juice0: oh nice congrats!
 xxd: thanks!
 xxd: yeah so im just working on optimization now
 juice0: that might be my next one once i finish that top 2% one
 xxd: awesome, good luck on it!
 xxd: which games do you have your eye on
 juice0: redoing ghost in the cell tonight and hope that pushes me over.  just reached gold in legends of code and magic earlier today
 juice0: did that and gold in ultimate tic tac toe.  tried hypersonic but got a little overwhelmed and didn't get back into it
 xxd: congrats on LoCAM
 xxd: thats a real chonker of a game
 xxd: UTTT is a fun one, I learned MCTS doing it
 rqwerqwe: guys what is 9223372036854775807&#160;% 4? ddg's calc is saying its 0, but when I print the value I get 3
 xxd: cant say im familiar with the others, but hope you have fun&#160;:)
 xxd: you can just look at the last two digits to determine mod 4 residue
 xxd: so you're right
 juice0: thank you.  yeah i should have read what worked for others in uTTT.  i would've attempted a monte carlo too.  but i was deep into doing it another way and just got lucky it kept working
 xxd: ah, haha
 xxd: "local optimum" innit
 xxd: i'm gonna ditch my current greedy strategy in CvZ for monte carlo
 xxd: All hail MC!
 juice0: that's right.  when you've got a new hammer, everything looks like a nail
 xxd: including @holite
 xxd: just kidding&#160;;)
 juice0: haha well he was responding to the hammer
 xxd: :banhammer:
 xxd: is there a quest path on the right part of the quest "board"? or is that just empty space
 juice0: the clash and contribution tracks are on the righthand side for me
 juice0: based on how i remember it, i should say
 xxd: yeah, there's a column of empty squares to the right of it, though
 xxd: it sorta forms a nice path going upward and to the left at the top
 xxd: it would be a shame for there not to be another quest path :smirk:
 juice0: it could be designed with a later addition there in mind
 rqwerqwe: how can I get harder clash of code problems when doing private matches with friends
 xxd: CoC problems have no difficulty ranking
 xxd: as a result, there is no such concept as filtering problems by difficulty
 LittleFlea: ^this is true
 LittleFlea: and you get paired with master
 rqwerqwe: thats dumb ngl
 xxd: yeah but its like elo sorta
 xxd: so the master loses a ton of rating if he loses to u but u dont lose much against him
 M0narchicalMush: I have zero clue as to what im doing&#160;:/
 xxd: same here, man, same here
 M0narchicalMush: just threw me in as if i had any standing..
 M0narchicalMush: betraal
 M0narchicalMush: betrayal*
 juice0: it's too bad i'm not in the mood to clash right now.  i smell blood in the water!
 M0narchicalMush: How do we get more insight onto what to do before it throws us into the pool?
 xxd: are you referring to clash?
 xxd: clash of code*
 M0narchicalMush: just in general
 M0narchicalMush: I felt like i had no preperation at all
 xxd: i generally dont recommend this site to others as a way to learn how to code
 xxd: like you should know how to code before coming onto here
 M0narchicalMush: Still, just asked me to copy and paste shit (which i didnt, i hand typed) how is that helping anyone?
 xxd:&#160;?
 xxd: where
 M0narchicalMush: tutorial
 juice0: i don't even remember the tutorial
 michaellan: yeah, sorry, neither do i
 michaellan: i might create an alt sometime just to test my TTT MCTS on the Wood league of UTTT
 michaellan: but i can sorta expect the results already
 juice0: hm i might be back a little later tonight.  ciao for now
 michaellan: 再见
 michaellan: good night, to whoever sees this

 MuaKuZ: normally there is always a fragment of pseudocode on the left. I have nothing there. am new and if I have forgotten something or it is due to the settings please let me know .. thank you
 ProCoder03: Nahh... Its only there in few puzzles for beginners to start with 
 MuaKuZ: i strated with coders strike back -same time as a friend of mine- he has the pseudo code but i havent it ...
 MuaKuZ: started
 ProCoder03: Wait!! Thats ain't possible
 MuaKuZ: we both started with the first lesson in coders strike back -he has the pseudocode straight under the simulation but not me... we were in ms teams and we both searched for it ...
 KiwiTae: there is a reset button on the ide
 ProCoder03: Wood I in CSB doesn't have psuedocode afaik
 ProCoder03: The hint comes kinda like a pop up like onboarding iirc
 derjack: oO
 ProCoder03:&#160;??
 ProCoder03: any clues how to do ASCII arts&#160;??
 ProCoder03: plz
 ProCoder03: nah... just found the hints Thanks BTW
 derjack:&#160;!
 MuaKuZ: it was told me code is under the simulation in the scroll area and not in a pop up....but thanks for help   perhaps a rooki fail or something like that
 MuaKuZ: of me
 MuaKuZ: not code i mean a piece of pseudo code 
 ProCoder03: pseudocode under the game windows comes only in wood II 
 MuaKuZ: we had both the same game open    and it was  csb 
 ProCoder03: csb is a league based game&#160;!!!
 ProCoder03: you have Wood 3 to 1 , bronze ,....
 dmin: how do u beat wood1 
 dmin: rank 1st?
 martinpapa69: you need to use mathematics
 dmin: gotcha
 Hunter64TheOneCodinGame:    hello hello
 dmin: but you need to reach 1st on the overall leaderboards, right?
 martinpapa69: on the left side you only see your leagues leaderboard. once you get to the top, you get promoted to the next league
 dmin: gotcha!
 martinpapa69: unless you are in legend league
 derjack: if he were, i doubt he would be asking that :v
 Wontonimo: hey dmin, try changing your targeting
 Wontonimo: instead of targeting the checkpoint,
 Wontonimo: target the checkpoint minus your velocity
 Wontonimo: velocity = position - previous position
 derjack: wontonimk
 BlaiseEbuth: Wontonimod
 martinpapa69: 3veltonimo
 Wontonimo: what the heck?
 martinpapa69: whatthehecktonimo
 Wontonimo: should i stop?  
 Wontonimo: this doesn't feel friendly tbh
 derjack: its alright
 reCurse: Unfortunately often in this chat
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... Sad...&#160;:(
 derjack: hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: Bad people are bad derjack&#160;:(
 derjack: :rage:
 derjack: Wontonimo dont stop. anything that can keep people from clashes is good
 Uljahn: MK was notorious for pushing csb and -3vel too much hence that memeing, nothing to be upset about
 eulerscheZahl: can explaining the -3v via teamviewer
 Tuan2k8:  Hello
 michaellan: who's MK?
 eulerscheZahl: MadKnight
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/b50b600f5dc25555f35bd2da9a0cf8a07356021">https://www.codingame.com/profile/b50b600f5dc25555f35bd2da9a0cf8a07356021</a>
 eulerscheZahl: not the other one that pops up when you enter his nick in the search bar
 xxd: gotcha
 xxd: -3vel is overpowered
 xxd: at least from what i've observed, it makes it so that you sorta lightly "brush" each checkpoint instead of going straight through the center of it
 michaellan: and i also find boosting near the start is helpful, since my bot doesntt want collisions
 michaellan: clarification question: for CvZ, when a zombie is killed, is it scored based off how many humans are alive *in that moment* or *at the end of the game*?
 eulerscheZahl: that moment
 michaellan: cool, that makes things way easier. thanks
 MiyamuraIzumi: do we have anyone that achieve all legend medal?
 MiyamuraIzumi: *ACHIEVEMENTS
 ProCoder03: For that , we need one fellow who is literally proficient in all languages supported by CG
 BlaiseEbuth: No.
 xxd: that shouldn't be too bad ProCoder03, you can solve the same easy puzzles in many languages
 BlaiseEbuth: But you can't create a contest anymore \o/
 xxd: what??
 jacek: oO
 michaellan: for CvZ can you do any better than n=100 zombies * n=100 humans when calculating zombie moves?
 michaellan: its a lot of computation i think
 MiyamuraIzumi: in cVz can you do better than me?
 xxd: probably not&#160;:)
 xxd: i'm still writing mine out
 michaellan: MiyamuraIzumi what type of approach are you using for CvZ?
 MiyamuraIzumi: Monte Carlo
 michaellan: ah, same. maybe i'll finish by today and i'll tell you how mine does
 MiyamuraIzumi: nice&#160;:)
 michaellan: are you using eldidou's strategy by chance?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I just remember I've use strategy of an article in discussion
 MiyamuraIzumi: it's been too long that I don't remember the Author
 michaellan: that is probably the one, yeah
 michaellan: cool
 Shivay: @Driikolu i want to get advice from you 
 michaellan: um... can someone clarify the fibonacci multiplier for CvZ? Letting h = number of humans stiill alive, if I kill 1 zombie I get h*h*10, but if I kill two I get 3*h*h*10 + 5*h*h*10?
 michaellan: because it says the (n+2)th fibonacci number and the sequence in the problem statement starts at 1,2,3,5...
 michaellan: i am wondering if that sequence already accounts for the n+2, in which case 2 zombies would give 1*h*h*10 + 2*h*h*10
 michaellan: okay its definitely the latter
 Shivay: anyone say where can use html javascript
 Scarfield: xxd, the fibonacci seq. starts (0,1,1,2,3,5,..) so the (1,2,3,5,8,..) already accounts for n+2. each zombie killed in the same turn, will get its own multiplier, the 1st zombie: x1, 2nd zombie: x2, 4th zombie x5, and so on
 xxd: thanks
 xxd: I don't think i'm doing MC correctly...
 martinpapa69: i dont think pure mc will give good result there. you need to combine with heristics
 xxd: awwww
 jacek: like nn
 xxd: bruh -_-
 Scarfield: i used GA for CvZ, but i dont know what approach is better, i just wanted to try it
 martinpapa69: if you read the winners postmortem youll see you can get good results with very simple algo
 xxd: is the winner's postmortem not an MC?
 xxd: i am trying to replicate it
 martinpapa69: mc with heuristics
 Scarfield: the current top players got the validators, locally optimised for them, and hardcoded their submissions afaik
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/cvz.txt">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/cvz.txt</a>
 martinpapa69: wow
 eulerscheZahl: mine is still online. couldn't do offline as my sim has some off by one errors
 eulerscheZahl: and i didn't bother
 Scarfield: lol, also for code of the ring xD i need to go back and try that again some time, looked interesting when i saw, but had no idea of how to approach it then
 Scarfield: still dont now that i think of it
 eulerscheZahl: i do beam search
 eulerscheZahl: offline
 xxd: what does online/offline mean eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: offline = you play the optim on your own computer and hardcode a sequence of moves
 xxd: ah i see
 eulerscheZahl: i ran my search for maybe 10 minutes on some of the code of the rings validators
 TobiasA: big brain stuff yea?:nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: no, compensating for small brain with more CPU power
 TobiasA: you need big brain to accomplish that 
 TobiasA: how contradictive:triumph:

 eulerscheZahl: that's a french thing
 martinpapa69: unacceptable .
 eulerscheZahl: most of them also write "exemple"
 BlaiseEbuth: Will see what happen after the chat crash of this week end...
 jacek: after friday patches?
 Wontonimo: why does your mod badge goes away so often Blaise?
 Wontonimo: *go
 BlaiseEbuth: Goes Tibo and the XMPP server don't agree about my mod status.
 BlaiseEbuth: *cause
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm tired... -_-
 michaellan: so is blaise a mod or not...
 Uljahn: not anymore
 BlaiseEbuth: No.
 BlaiseEbuth: But the server disagree
 Uljahn: so the mod status actually doesn't go away, it returns back due to the chat reboot
 michaellan: why cant they just fix it so the chat reboot doesnt give him mod again
 michaellan: also, is the thing where the chat breaks a weekly occurrence? 
 eulerscheZahl: it's a random occurence
 jacek: once a mod, always a mod. you cant escape destiny
 BlaiseEbuth: Wowowo, they will not totally remake their entire system, that bug since years btw, just to avoid the chat to set me back mod... :rofl:
 xxd: :rage:
 BlaiseEbuth: What is it again? Ah right "That's not the priority" :smirk:
 xxd: the priority is making more escape rooms :rolling_eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: Right.
 eulerscheZahl: there are also other moderation-like statuses that everyone can achieve. reach level 29 and you can edit all community puzzles
 <b>**eulerscheZahl still can't edit faulty clashes</b></p><p><img src="/a/68885807866035" /> xxd: D:
 BlaiseEbuth: "We are conscient that the moderation system is far as perfect, but that's NOT THE PRIORITY"
 Astrobytes: I can't either. And I refuse to play enough clashes that I can.
 xxd: well if you desire any edits, I got you
 eulerscheZahl: "is far as perfect"? do you mean far from perfect?
 xxd: I am a clashing degenerate
 xxd: (reformed)
 eulerscheZahl: not currently. sometimes users pop up in chat and report problems with a certain puzzle or clash
 BlaiseEbuth: I probably meant that, yes.
 xxd: I see, that makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm like "yeah i see the problem. maybe someone else can fix it"
 xxd: so you basically go to its contribution page and edit it there right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 xxd: is there an easy way to go from the clash to the contribution page?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 BlaiseEbuth: "Not the priority"
 xxd: well thats probably for the better
 eulerscheZahl: maybei don't knowcan you repeat the question
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes knows the TV show&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Malcolm in the Middle?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remember it
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen all episodes as a kid. and then again as an adult
 Astrobytes: I haven't rewatched it at all, it was pretty good
 jacek: mitm?
 eulerscheZahl: man in the middle?
 jacek: :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: o//\o/\\o
 eulerscheZahl: malcolm aired on Pro7 here in Germany. Replaced Sabrina iirc

 xxd: locally*
 martinpapa69: what language
 xxd: C++
 reCurse: Yeah those games are toughest to debug
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/kE918FW">https://imgur.com/a/kE918FW</a>(that's mars lander)
 eulerscheZahl: you could generate SVG images. the syntax is pretty simple
 eulerscheZahl: and then use something like imagemagick to make a full animated gif if you see need
 xxd: wow, that sounds interesting
 eulerscheZahl: i should figure out how to add the marslander crash sound to that gif :P
 martinpapa69: there is a good c++ lib for simple 2d visualizer. forgo the name tho
 reCurse: In the same spirit you can just write html files, that gives you more options if you're comfortable with web techs

 Swyfti: ai legend level?

 eulerscheZahl: i used the standard C# way (System.Drawing library)

 eulerscheZahl: drawing a png is 20-30 lines of code if you just want something basic.and some #if DEBUG since CG switched to .net core and forgot to include System.Drawing.Common&#160;:/
 martinpapa69: he uses c++. he cant just bitmap.draw(new circle())
 reCurse: The bottom line is as long as you dump enough information in a text file, you can use pretty much anything ever made
 reCurse: So have fun
 xxd: rip
 eulerscheZahl: using(Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(byBitmap)) {g.FillEllipse(...)
 Swyfti: is this for c#
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Swyfti: omg
 reCurse: That API can be notoriously slow btw
 reCurse: Not that there's much better for c#
 Swyfti: i love c# as a language, because i create games in unity
 eulerscheZahl: i know. that's a true annoyance
 reCurse: Using javascript canvas might actually be the easiest, as much as I dislike saying that
 jacek: :scream:
 xxd: oh thats good idea
 eulerscheZahl: no pixi?
 reCurse: Wayyyy overkill
 eulerscheZahl: just kidding
 eulerscheZahl: did pixi once for the interactive number shifting version (just wanted to try it)
 eulerscheZahl: some overhead, not that much fun to code for me
 xxd: i dont even have 16000 pixels by 9000 pixels -_-
 reCurse: *cough*scaling
 eulerscheZahl: and frying my GPU even when there is just a static image to show
 reCurse: That doesn't sound right
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.github.io/NumberShifting.html">https://eulerschezahl.github.io/NumberShifting.html</a>test it
 BlaiseEbuth: If you scale enough you can even represent the map in a console with ascii char. ^^
 reCurse: I can't my gpu is in rather high load atm
 martinpapa69: you can visualse the whole map in a pixel
 xxd: peak efficiency
 jacek: gpu used for chess i presume
 reCurse: Correct
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: Bit late but the OLC Pixel Game Engine is handy for visuals (one header file, easy AF to set up)
 xxd: this is too overwhelming for me for now&#160;:(
 xxd: just wanted to visualize some dots going around on a rectangle :rage:
 Astrobytes: Try the one I suggested, guaranteed drawing things in minutes
 reCurse: Or else?
 eulerscheZahl: account delete
 Astrobytes: Or else... drawing nothing. In minutes.
 reCurse: That's not how guarantees work
 Astrobytes:&#160;:(
 withab: after coders strike back, what is the simpliest bot fight&#160;?
 reCurse: You're implying coders strike back is among the simplest?
 eulerscheZahl: as CSB isn't the simplest (in my opinion): do you ask for the easiest overall of the next harder one?
 withab: the easiest
 ViviCode: my quest map suggested Ghost in the Cell as an introduction to bot fights
 eulerscheZahl: rule-wise this is really simple: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: still not easy to reach the top
 withab: thanks 
 withab: i'll see
 xxd: i liked UTTT
 xxd: going from TTT -&gt; UTTT was a smooth transition for me and allowed me to take it a step at a time
 xxd: (ultimate tic tac toe)
 reCurse: I wish that was a bannable offense
 Thyl: Hi&#160;!
 AllYourTrees: how's the progress on ultimate C4 coming along?
 TobiasA: you can't be serious
 xxd: reCurse: what?
 reCurse: Joking
 xxd: oops must have flown over my head
 Astrobytes: xxd: reCurse *really* doesn't like UTTT
 xxd: ah
 xxd: too boring? or...
 TobiasA: i just got promoted to bronze in uttt
 TobiasA: now i feel like procrastinating
 xxd: I just don't get how getting 40k on CvZ is only bronze
 xxd: it feels quite difficult to me
 TobiasA: facts
 TobiasA: it should have been legend
 xxd: -_-
 martinpapa69: wow even optims have leagues now&#160;?
 xxd: no i meant the bronze certification, sorry
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about that stuff
 MSmits: man, those sideeffects are no joke
 MSmits: got my 2nd shot yesterday
 MSmits: a bit late, wife and daughter had it 2 weeks earlier
 Astrobytes: I had to reschedule mine due to er, having it
 MSmits: did you have a 1st shot?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 MSmits: they're not sure if it's worth getting a 2nd then
 MSmits: they're sure it's not worth it if you did covid and then 1 shot
 MSmits: but you did 1 shot, then covid
 Astrobytes: Well, I had covid, got one shot, and have covid again so...
 martinpapa69: wow
 MSmits: then it's not worth getting a 2nd shot
 MSmits: but damn 
 reCurse: Have you tried not getting covid?
 Astrobytes: Hey it was over a year apart
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: Seriously. I'm unbelievably careful
 Astrobytes: I am also notoriously unlucky.
 MSmits: except your grocery shopping is like a minefield right?
 borrel: why would you get a shot when you have had covid?
 MSmits: you need at least 1 shot borrel
 Astrobytes: Yeah. No amount of care on your part can mitigate idiots.
 MSmits: even if you've gotten covid
 MSmits: the vaccine offers more protection than getting the actual virus, it seems
 borrel: woudent you have antyboddyies?
 MSmits: yes, some
 MSmits: but the second time your body goes into overdrive producing them
 MSmits: which is why i feel like crap now and not the first time
 borrel: i cee
 MSmits: i am talking about shots btw
 MSmits: i never got the virus thankfully
 Astrobytes: FWIW, my mother also has COVID - after second jab (AZ, I had Pfizer). I blame myself.
 MSmits: delta probably&#160;?
 MSmits: it's notorious for breakthrough cases
 MSmits: but should be far less severe
 Astrobytes: They don't give you details but yes I would wager most of my money on it.
 Astrobytes: It's noticeably similar.
 MSmits: i can't even convince my mother to take a shot&#160;:(
 MSmits: she's really careful, but it's gonna get her at some point
 Astrobytes: But I'm nowhere near as bad as I was before. Unbelievably exhausted and awful, awful cough but not like before.
 borrel: getting it is not the worst for most peaple
 Astrobytes: It will. Not a question of if it will, a question of when.
 borrel: oops timing
 borrel: sorry
 MSmits: right, but my mom is 70 and diabetic
 MSmits: so...
 borrel: oof
 Astrobytes: Why won't she get the shot?
 MSmits: she is paranoid about some parts of the health system
 MSmits: not from watching right wing nutters or something
 MSmits: she always watched cnn until trump was gone
 Astrobytes: She got dementia of any kind?
 MSmits: nope
 borrel: well we have the opeoid cirisis
 MSmits: she just has selective paranoia
 Astrobytes: Hm. What causes her paranoia?
 MSmits: she took care of demented patients for around 20 yrs
 MSmits: and she saw them get dosed with some heavy medication
 MSmits: haldol and such
 MSmits: this made he trust the health system less
 Astrobytes: Oh right. Gonna be hard to reassure her
 MSmits: her
 MSmits: yeah for some people there is no point in pushing
 MSmits: they'll only dig in
 Astrobytes: But try to at least assure her that the jab isn't haloperidol
 MSmits: no she knows that
 MSmits: but she just has a general sense of distrust
 Astrobytes: *anything like I mean
 MSmits: she does take a lot of other healthcare. The paranoia is very selective
 MSmits: like insulin 
 Astrobytes: Fair. The psychiatric care scene is only very recently becoming semi-humane
 MSmits: and she had eye surgery
 borrel: also, Talk to you doctor
 MSmits: every doctor says the same thing though
 MSmits: so you can talk to any doctor
 MSmits: they'll all tell you to take the shot unless there is something really weird about you
 martinpapa69: ye they have something in their had that they were thought to
 martinpapa69: and they try to see the patterns on the patients
 MSmits: who are you talking about?
 martinpapa69: doctors
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: well when it comes to covid, you really don't need a doctors advice unless you have some special conditions
 MSmits: like the condition of: right wing media indoctrination
 Rob022: left wing === right wing
 MSmits: not when it comes to vaccination
 borrel: extremist === extremist
 MSmits: but sure, they both have extremists
 Astrobytes: If that was the case they'd all be centrist.
 MSmits: covid denial is almost 100% on the right
 Rob022: left and right are the same people, just to oppress people who don't think like them
 Astrobytes: Only one of the extremists here has been conjured up again recently. You guess. I'm not participating any further in this discussion.
 Rob022: both sides are idiots
 MSmits: right Astrobytes, i'm stopping also&#160;:)
 MSmits: 1 more week of vacation and then I'm teaching again
 MSmits: hope I get to teach full classes and not this annoying semi-physical + online thing
 Astrobytes: Have you accomplished ytour set vacation tasks MSmits?
 MSmits: that doesn't work at all
 Astrobytes: *your
 MSmits: around half Astrobytes, I still have hope for next week
 Astrobytes: Pretty good going tbh
 MSmits: i got the meta mcts for oware to work with the 1-36 seeds endgame books
 MSmits: works like a charm
 MSmits: given enough time it easily finds the moves played by robo and jace k
 MSmits: and it's super fast because it only plays down to 36
 Astrobytes: Nice. You were planning to use this for your NN
 MSmits: yes i am now considering training it only on the endgame books
 MSmits: and just putting an opening book in there for the start
 MSmits: it really doesn't take many moves
 Astrobytes: Surely it would converge to the same moves anyway
 MSmits: and I can put 100k in there and use half the code space
 MSmits: training it on the endgame books should make it work better because it's more specialized
 MSmits: may need a smaller network
 Astrobytes: Yes I see your idea, should be interesting
 MSmits: yeah and if nothing else it's just more NN practice. The hardest part is getting the inferrer to work
 MSmits: I looked more closely at marchete's work
 martinpapa69: hat is a "1-36 seeds endgame books"&#160;?
 martinpapa69: what*
 MSmits: oware starts with 48 seeds
 MSmits: I brute forced all game states with 36 or less seeds
 MSmits: so i know the solved value
 MSmits: assuming no turn limit
 martinpapa69: i see
 MSmits: this takes 57 GB on my disk btw
 MSmits: using 7 bits per state
 MSmits: so it's a lot
 MSmits: 7 bits because the values are between -48 and + 48
 MSmits: err i mean -36 to +36
 MSmits: but still doesn't fit in 6 bit
 MSmits: 31 seeds would fit in 6 bit
 reCurse: You could try compressing
 martinpapa69: wait you encode the whole state in 7 bit&#160;?
 MSmits: no, the solved value 
 MSmits: the net seed gain
 MSmits: for the player currently to move
 MSmits: the state itself is not stored. I have an index function
 martinpapa69: oh so you work with seed diff
 MSmits: reCurse not sure if there is any gain to be had from compression. I don't think there are long series of similar results. Can't be sure until i test of course
 MSmits: martinpapa69 yes, so that way i can use the result no matter what the score is
 MSmits: i just add it to whatever the current score is
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Bitstreams!!1!!! :P
 martinpapa69: why dont you give the game value to states&#160;?
 martinpapa69: -1, 0, 1
 MSmits: because the game value also depends on the current score
 MSmits: if 12 seeds have been captured
 MSmits: it matters if it's 12-0 or 6-6
 MSmits: with the net seed gain, the score doesn't matter
 MSmits: not for the usefulness of the lookup that is
 reCurse: I think you underestimate what some compression can do
 MSmits: that's entirely possible
 MSmits: but when having a book of gamevalues that can only be 0, -1 or 1, compression is more succesful than when there are 73 different possible values
 MSmits: at least that is my assumption
 MSmits: but maybe i am only thinking about run-length compression or whatever that's called and a more advanced form would work better
 reCurse: RLE is neanderthal
 MSmits: no doubt&#160;:)
 reCurse: Just try it
 reCurse: Grab zstd and run it with typical params
 MSmits: what exactly should I try?
 MSmits: zstd?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: I'm going to try it just out of curiosity, but what exactly would be the gain of having it compressed?
 MSmits: during use it would have to be extracted right?
 reCurse: You seemed to mention storage as an issue
 MSmits: oh, i just wanted to give an idea of how much data it is. The disk space isnt really the main bottleneck
 reCurse: Nevermind then
 MSmits: during generation, RAM is the main issue
 MSmits: the last book used 29 GB of it
 MSmits: almost all of it
 MSmits: i could have gone further with memory mapping and such, but it'd be so much slower that it would take months
 Astrobytes: Cause it's only taken days up to now? :P
 MSmits: no, I think from the start, using a single core it was 2-3 weeks total
 MSmits: but more cores might not have been helpful considering the memory issue
 MSmits: this game is really very solvable. I think you could do it for less than 5k Euros
 MSmits: but you'd have to assume infinite turns, the turn limit messes things up
 martinpapa69: this turn thingy sucks
 Astrobytes: Write a preliminary paper, get funding, get solved
 MSmits: mmh I think it should not be coded by me. I can come up with the algorithm for it, but when i read papers about this, they use some extreme tricks to make this go faster
 Astrobytes: Yes. So reach out to people.
 MSmits: also they run it on like 40 systems at once
 MSmits: mmh I might at some point. Not sure if this is an area of interest though. I should check out what the most popular version of oware is and try for that one instead
 martinpapa69: is this game acttually played by anyone&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Why not this one? All unsolved games are of interest. Or most.
 Astrobytes: Yes martinpapa69
 MSmits: martinpapa69 it's in African countries what chess is here and go is in asia
 martinpapa69: hm, thought its just an ancient game
 MSmits: but there are many versions of it
 Astrobytes: It's that too, yes.
 MSmits: but i was saying
 martinpapa69: pretty good game to experiment with nns tho
 MSmits: i was looking at marchetes work
 MSmits: I have a lot of problems extracting th e inferrer from it
 MSmits: his code is alien to me
 MSmits: i can just steal the whole thing and make an azero bot, but thats not what i want
 martinpapa69: you can code the nn part in 150 lines
 MSmits: really&#160;?
 martinpapa69: yes, i actually did that
 MSmits: can you point to me, roughly, which parts i need in his code?
 MSmits: i saw some matrix and avx stuff
 martinpapa69: if you only want to use the nn only i wouldnt recommend to start with that code
 martinpapa69: because of the avx stuff
 MSmits: well i need the avx stuff
 martinpapa69: it makes it look much more complex than it actually is
 MSmits: I am actually reasonably competent with avx
 MSmits: but yeah i get what you're saying
 martinpapa69: i removed the avx part
 martinpapa69: it got even faster
 MSmits: you dont do any simd?
 MSmits: huh&#160;??
 MSmits: autovectorization?
 martinpapa69: the compliler autovectorises
 MSmits: ahh
 martinpapa69: i use quantization for inference tho
 martinpapa69: with avx
 MSmits: well the nice part is that i am just doing a value network
 MSmits: no policy
 MSmits: so i can just take my bot and replace the eval function with this
 MSmits: martinpapa69 what problem are you running into with oware?
 MSmits: your bot is not getting into top 10 it seems
 MSmits: not saying that's easy. It took marchete a lot of effort too
 martinpapa69: im just experimenting. my best one was rank4-5
 MSmits: oh, nice
 MSmits: yeah i see a lot of martinpapa69 in my battle history
 martinpapa69: ye i experiment a lot :D
 MSmits: sooo... when you submit your good version, there are only NN's in top 10
 martinpapa69: ye
 MSmits: crazy
 MSmits: it's too bad that oware is such a hard game for a human to get a handle on
 MSmits: it's hard to see whether your bot is getting better, except for leaderboard results
 MSmits: well... I kinda memorized the first few best moves, from staring at meta mcts, but that's not the same as knowing why moves are good
 martinpapa69: ye, thats what i dont like about this game
 MSmits: the simplicity is nice though
 martinpapa69: on csb for example you isntanly see if your bot acts good
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: on uttt it's the same thing. It's simplicity is nice to learn mcts with, but again, hard to see if it's making good moves
 MSmits: othello same
 MSmits: at least for me. I have no idea how to play that game
 martinpapa69: It would be nice if we had a better sandbox game for nn practice
 MSmits: I can play a strong yavalath game though
 Uljahn: contribution replays can't be shared, right? i think Space shooter have a bug
 MSmits: not sure Uljahn
 Astrobytes: Yeah, no sharing of contrib replays. Need to describe it on the contribution Uljahn
 Astrobytes: *contribution comment section
 michaellan: meta MCTS?
 MSmits: a mcts that starts games instead of running a simulation 
 MSmits: so you got selection, expansion, then instead of the rollout, you set up a full game with calculation time and all, to get a result to backpropagate

 shayah_goba: can someone tell me where to learn python with zero knowledge of python
 shayah_goba:&#160;???
 Dragon84: i Just bought an interesting udemy course
 shayah_goba: even if i know nothing about python
 shayah_goba: 0
 UrbanWhale: Hello Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: my only goal is to just run it
 Dragon84: yes, it starts with 0 experience
 shayah_goba: ok thx
 Dragon84: u start with a web interface of python code programming, so no need to install python at the beginning
 xxd: Automaton2000 ur a noob
 Automaton2000: at the end of the loop
 Dragon84: and with mor lessons u get the progress of installing it using all the librarys and so on
 michaellan: oh my god i think i misunderstood the CVZ post-mortem algorithm
 Rob022: Hi
 michaellan: For the CvZ, would it be better to uniformly choose an angle in which to move, or randomly pick an X and Y coordinate?
 michaellan: the X and Y are more biased but that might not be a bad hting
 Rob022: :violin:
 michaellan: well i must be doing rollouts too slowly... only ~120k in the 90 milliseconds while eldidou did around 1 million it seems
 michaellan: i hate optimization
 KNTK: Is it okay to hard code validation tests in optimization puzzles?
 Westicles: yes
 KNTK: I suppose optimizing the hard coding is the task then
 Westicles: yeah, there are several optims where you need to solve offline

 Mundgus: Yeah
 Mundgus: But if I do:print()print('foo')
 ZarthaxX: that should work..
 ZarthaxX: you can also use \n
 Mundgus: I tried this too:s = '\nfoo'
 ZarthaxX: mm
 ZarthaxX: it should be working :P
 Mundgus: Yeah, I know :D
 michaellan: i shouldnt have needed to code an entire visualizatiion to realize this :cry:

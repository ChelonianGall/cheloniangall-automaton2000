 Kellthazar: I finished my simulation + genetic algorithm a couple of weeks ago, but I couldn't thought a clever way to create a initial population. I tried several ways til think on "force" the initial genes with a pre-established directions... Then the magic happened! :D
 Passifi: So pythons range function doesn't support floats just as I am warming up to that language it backstabes me ... everytime ...
 AgathokakologicalBit: Does anyone have code for simulating MarsLander game?
 derjack: Passifi use numpy arrange(?)
 DaNinja: Muzkaw has a video on building a Lunar Lander app <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcYXlosxBzk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcYXlosxBzk</a>
 Passifi: yo derJack yeah i found that one too. but thanks&#160;:)
 AgathokakologicalBit: @DaNinja, thx
 MeSeet: NN+GA (NEAT)  in js vs in python? What are your thougths?
 KiwiTae: C++ ftw
 derjack: youll get more tools for python. for performance, of course c++
 derjack: though python acts here as wrapper for c++ stuff
 MadKnight: MeSeet what exactly kind of combination&#160;?
 Joseph_Mother: Ay ay ay
 Joseph_Mother: cmon now
 Joseph_Mother: :flag_il:
 Joseph_Mother: Dang 38 seconds
 Joseph_Mother: im not bad huh
 Joseph_Mother: I got an issue yall
 Joseph_Mother: When u print numbers in lua its like 1.0 instead of 1
 Joseph_Mother: and it causes alot of issues n stuff and ive lost clashes before because of it
 Joseph_Mother: so i have to do like tostring(num):sub(1,-3) every time i need to output a number
 DaNinja: did you try ~~x or x|0
 Joseph_Mother: that aint valid lua syntax
 DaNinja: x-x%1
 Joseph_Mother: lol
 Katespizer: is cursing on CoC channels allowed?
 jacek: bloody hell!
 AgathokakologicalBit: Oh, my stars and garters! O:
 Q12: Can somebody that know python very well help me in "Don't Panic" optimization challenge? Need to be less than 200 characters but the closest I get is 296. I think that my current way of solving is enough to complete it, just need to reduce the number of characters and don't know how.
 RoboStac: if you've solved it you can check other peoples solutions in the standard (non golf version). See if there are any ideas in there you can use
 JerWhatIsCode: ^ this is super useful looking at others code even if you solve any puzzle perfectly fine. I think it's the best part of this site, being able to see how other people approach the same problem.
 NicknameAlreadyTakenHelp: bad
 Q12: Thanks a lot, good idea @RoboStac and @JerWhatIsCode :thumbsup:
 KelvinAndHubbles: how long till the "Max number of submissions and test cases tried" thingy goes away?
 MadKnight: hmm where did u get that&#160;?
 KelvinAndHubbles: Code Vs Zombies
 KelvinAndHubbles: its due to a lot of test cases
 MadKnight: do u test them all at once very often&#160;?
 KelvinAndHubbles: well yeah, thats why I have the notif, probably should just be doing some lower down ones
 MadKnight: there's one pretty important 
 MadKnight: that can give u 464k for just that 1 test
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/310155287">https://www.codingame.com/replay/310155287</a>
 MadKnight: use this one instead of them all
 Uljahn: KelvinAndHubbles: you are given 25 submission attempts per 5 hours, it doesn't depend on the number of validators i guess

 MasterCoderxD: hey
 Scarfield: hi
 MasterCoderxD: what does (t&#160;:= b) mean?
 eulerscheZahl: it also shows some background
 MSmits: set t equal to b
 eulerscheZahl: Pascal syntax
 MSmits: or bind t to b
 AntiSquid: is it new python syntax?
 MSmits: or syntax error, depending on the language
 MasterCoderxD: like? t=b?
 MasterCoderxD: it's just basic algorithm yntax
 MSmits: yeah t = b should be similar
 AntiSquid: like tell us what language you're using lol
 eulerscheZahl: pseudo code
 AntiSquid: or you could look it up in language docs yourself

 deoignition: remove shortest code mode right now :rage:
 KelvinAndHubbles: make reverse + shortest mode now &gt;:D
 jacek: it would be easier actually. once you figure out reverse, you have more time to complete it
 eulerscheZahl: make a new mode: you get a solution and have to find a puzzle
 deoignition: reverse mode is oke
 deoignition: shortest code mode is garbage cuz python always wins
 jacek: use ruby [solved]
 KelvinAndHubbles: or just learn python 
 deoignition: :nauseated_face:
 deoignition: i know python
 jacek: an how come euler has mod badge when others dont
 deoignition: i just dont want to have to use it
 deoignition: and its unfair to people who dont want to learn a garbage language
 struct: a bug caused it jacek
 struct: They forgot some people&#160;:(
 deoignition: well clearly you are a mod
 deoignition: so you can remove shortest mode from right now :grinning:
 darkhorse64: mod not god
 deoignition: :frowning2:
 struct: Also you cant please everyone
 AntiSquid: deoignition what language do you use?
 struct: Plenty of people enjoy shortest
 deoignition: mainly c++ 
 AntiSquid: so just play multiplayer then, c++ usually wins
 NoctalIvan: I like shortest. But CoC multi language shortest is so unfair tbh
 struct: hmm
 struct: Languages have more advantage on shortest than on multies tbh
 ErrorRazor: It's not unfair, you're allowed to pick any language you want
 NoctalIvan: Well I'm learning Perl just for this
 AntiSquid: python and ruby are for premium VIP members only /s
 ANONYMOUS42: ruby or bust
 NoctalIvan: I just don't wanna
 struct: When I played CoC, I switched between Bash Ruby Perl Js and python
 struct: and I dont know any of them well
 AntiSquid: so coc didn't help you improve? shocker
 NoctalIvan: Yeah same. Mostly python &amp; JS so far
 struct: It teached me random math formulas and regex
 ErrorRazor: Didn't teach you the past tense of "teach" though
 AntiSquid: i feel like a lot of the ordinary puzzles force you to learn random math stuff
 AntiSquid: twat, there's your past tense
 Scarfield: ^
 NoctalIvan: Actually shortest teaches me a lotta stuff, imo
 jacek: happy code review for your coworkers
 ANONYMOUS42: how much CoC do you need to play to start getting repeating puzzles
 NoctalIvan: About how twisted for loops really work for instance
 NoctalIvan: Oh that's a good question. Never had any
 NoctalIvan: But some opponents at some points were like waaaay to fast to be reading the problem entirely
 ANONYMOUS42: yeah i remember playing it a few years ago and it there were like 20 second responses
 ANONYMOUS42: i think it's a bit better now
 ANONYMOUS42: or maybe they were just really fast idk
 NoctalIvan: Yup, I remember a guy making a bot to auto copy paste the answers to the stuff he had completed once :grin:
 NoctalIvan: In uni, years ago
 NoctalIvan: Nah. 50 secs can be legit but 20 is too short. Even if they didn't bot anything it's only possible if they knew the subject imo
 NoctalIvan: Which technically isn't cheating
 struct: If they know the clash under 20 sec is possible
 ANONYMOUS42: yes
 ANONYMOUS42: that was kind of my point
 AntiSquid: not everyone knows the clash and i've seen it too often, even for longer clashes instant submits ...
 AntiSquid: so screw clash, unless you want to do shortest for fun
 ANONYMOUS42: i always like reverse for some reason
 ANONYMOUS42: liked*
 snoyes: I have just completed a clash in 22 seconds, having never seen it before and without using any bot or script or anything else resembling cheating.
 jacek: oO
 JohnnyHotBody: Dang your good!
 ErrorRazor: What's the max execution time for puzzles? Is it the same for every puzzle? There's nothing specified in potw
 jacek: not enough to brute force it in any way
 ErrorRazor: Why would you want to brute force it anyway
 jacek: because im dumb
 aamirhs: 15 mins i guess?
 snoyes: where do you manage who you are "following" and who is following you, and what do you see when you follow someone?
 AntiSquid: profile page
 Wilster: -=W=-
 jonzel: is it a smart career move in college to do a lot of c++? Or should you rather spend more time with python and java
 struct: What do you mean by move in college to do a lot of c++?

 jonzel: oh, I meant "career move"&#160;:-D
 snoyes: Is it a (wise thing to do) (while in college) to...
 Wayne_Ker: Hi can someone help me
 struct: ah you mean doing side project while in uni?
 jonzel: yeah, sorry english is not my first language
 Wayne_Ker: im building a calculator and im running out of ideas for different buttons
 Wayne_Ker: i already got 40 different and i need 3 more
 Theino: do you have addition?
 struct: factorial?
 Wayne_Ker: yep
 Theino: welp, I'm out of ideas
 Grizzly21: PV and FV
 Wayne_Ker: sin cos tan ctn + - * / ** sqrt ...
 Wayne_Ker:&#160;!
 Wayne_Ker: | |
 Theino: arc sin, arc cos...
 struct: mod?
 Wayne_Ker: i dont eve3n know what that is
 Wayne_Ker:&#160;?
 jonzel: rounding
 Grizzly21: lots of financial fucntions you can add
 Wayne_Ker: i got pi e log too
 struct: modulo is the remainder
 Wayne_Ker: i got rounding too
 Wayne_Ker: i got parantheses
 jonzel: minutes to hours
 Wayne_Ker: that aint that hard
 Theino: oh ya, you could fill it up with conversions. lb to kg, minutes to hours, etc, etc
 Wayne_Ker: but i might add it too
 Theino: if you want harder, add some calculus functions
 Wayne_Ker: im too dumb for that
 Theino: then do conversions :P
 Wayne_Ker: its at least a year till we learn it
 jonzel: riemann zeta function 
 Wayne_Ker: k thx guys
 Wayne_Ker: &lt;3
 Theino: easy, but useful would be a pi and e button
 Wayne_Ker: got it
 Wayne_Ker: also what i dont understand is why the gui takes few sec to load
 Wayne_Ker: i use tkinter
 Wayne_Ker: py
 Theino: I've used tcl/tk but never tkinter so I don't think I can help you there
 Wayne_Ker: i used the time module to count the loading time
 Wayne_Ker: it took 0.2 sec to run from start to end
 Wayne_Ker: bet the gui takes a lot longer
 Wayne_Ker: im in a VM but my pc is good
 Wayne_Ker: so i dont think it is the problem

 eulerscheZahl: it is a board game&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: a buggy one atm
 wlesavo: i mean ive never seen that, but now i had :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: i think i have enough dices
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you mean you want to play in real life?
 wlesavo: yeah
 wlesavo: btw euler, i finally found an IT job thx to CG :slight_smile:
 kovi: gratz!
 eulerscheZahl: oh, awesome!
 eulerscheZahl: "IOF RAN"is your profile updated already?
 wlesavo: starting from april
 wlesavo: not yet
 eulerscheZahl: tell me more: what field, tech stack? working hours, ...
 wlesavo: smart engines, its a small somewhat scientific company with computer vision and tomogrphy development
 eulerscheZahl: so in the medical sector
 wlesavo: basically crossplatform C++ 
 wlesavo: not really, they doing high resolution CT for material study 
 wlesavo: their main product is recognition of different document on mobile devices, CT team is quite small, and im starting from CT
 jacek: how would you play those dices in real life overlapping?
 wlesavo: jacek you eat the dice if you finished on the same place with greater value
 eulerscheZahl: "with greater value" - wlesavo inventing new rules :D
 darkhorse64: you always move in straight lines&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but can't cross your own path
 eulerscheZahl: play boss vs boss
 wlesavo: euler oh, i just deduced it would work like that :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: but when a die has the number N on top, you have to move exactly N cells
 wlesavo: hm, from boss vs boss replay it looks like moving up to N cells

 wlesavo: i see
 darkhorse64: It's quite bad for bug reporting. CG, please fix it&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: i told CG to fix it when I found a BotG replay before the contest started&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: now it's not even relevant anymore as community contests are dead

 jacek: make it password locked
 eulerscheZahl: options are always good
 darkhorse64: same as allow people to dowload the boss code

 struct: dark horse I had no idea it was  possible when I asked you for othello boss&#160;:/
 darkhorse64: No worries, I took care to remove some parts of my usual MCTS code
 darkhorse64: Lesson learned, I will always write crappy minimax bosses
 darkhorse64: That's what I did for Clobber
 Tuo: Is the clobber boss supposed to be easy?
 leojean890: darkhorse64 one time, a boss code was public on github&#160;?;)
 leojean890: same question as Tuo xD no it's not very easy^^
 darkhorse64: No, I made it tough
 Tuo: i keep trying and trying and its not even close
 struct: no leojean890 its worse than that
 leojean890: it's alpha beta with good eval 
 leojean890: and god perfs
 leojean890: good*
 darkhorse64: leojean890: do you refer to the public Clobber repo&#160;?
 leojean890: struct how worse&#160;?:P
 Astrobytes: eh, ClobberSan is designed to test you
 leojean890: darkhorse64 you told me about your boss a few days ago
 leojean890: Astrobytes advised you about the eval and you did good perfs^^
 darkhorse64: The boss on the repo is a dummy one
 leojean890: but not iterative deepening
 leojean890: depth depending on branching factor
 leojean890: like I did but better than how I did it;)
 darkhorse64: Poor's man iterative deepening
 Scarfield: Astrobytes i think you missed this ealier <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/10ncweh">https://prnt.sc/10ncweh</a>
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: :D
 darkhorse64: Tip: implement a MCTS. Mine has 90+&#160;% winrate against the boss. No eval needed
 AntiSquid: hey clobber has no cover art
 AntiSquid: fix it
 jacek: who approved it&#160;:\
 Astrobytes: hahahaha Scarfield
 Tuo: my bot can do 15k 15 step full random sims and 18 total moves left min max.
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 struct: leojean890 I prefer not to discuss it in public anymore
 darkhorse64: I am a dev, not an artist
 Astrobytes: Can't you do a bigger one? I can't use that as an avatar!
 Tuo: suold this be enought?
 AntiSquid: devs know how to upload image files
 Astrobytes: struct: wise move
 leojean890: struct darkhorse64 one time, a boss code was public on github&#160;?;)
 leojean890: struct oh ok
 leojean890: not in public, right, sorry;)
 AntiSquid: fix breakthrough cover art while you're at it
 darkhorse64: Same answer
 darkhorse64: Tuo: I did not understand
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, I started breakthrough today, any tips?
 AntiSquid: i'll make a tutorial on tech.io how to upload a cover image
 jacek: Astrobytes bitboarding?
 darkhorse64: No tip from me. I suck at my own game
 Astrobytes: jacek: that's a given
 AntiSquid: and paper soccer could have cover art as well
 jacek: then its relatively cheap to find/avoid 3-ply win-lose, possibly more with more ifs
 darkhorse64: devs don't know how to design images
 AntiSquid: they know how to click select image and click upload and click confirm
 jacek: and home row is quite important
 jacek: but what image to select
 Astrobytes: mcts or ab approach is best? Or around the same?And yeah.
 Astrobytes: Guessing ept works here
 Tuo: darkhorse64 for MCTS you make a move and simulate game for x turns right? More sims the better and then minmax the end
 jacek: i used ab approach originally, it is quite evalable
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's a bunch of heuristics to use
 darkhorse64: Tuo: interesting approach. I use a solver instead of minimax
 Tuo: i thought the idea of clobber is to get as many sims as possible, hats what iv been doing for days :D
 jacek: it is true for mcts generally
 darkhorse64: I have 120k full random rollouts second turn
 jacek: and you do mcts until the end
 Tuo: So im not even close to beating the bot with 5-10k
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: MCTS/EPT but my eval is crappy
 jacek: huh? bot has 120k rollouts?
 darkhorse64: :nerd:
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: good to know, thx
 jacek: how do you people count the roullouts? i always have 10x less yet im at the same level
 struct: 1 rollout = 1 play until end?
 darkhorse64: yes
 jacek: thats how i count it
 jacek: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: 'Harnessing' that pony magic jacek
 jacek: and i always have the solver implied
 Astrobytes: For some games though you do things a little differently from some of us
 darkhorse64: Same. My rollouts are dumb
 jacek: im talking vanilla mcts. for uttt before i had 10k in second turn, yet people claimed they had over 100k
 jacek: and i was top20
 Astrobytes: Yeah but didn't you do something different there? (that's specifically the one I was thinking of)
 jacek: i had some heuristics biasing the selection and rolloutsbut rather light ones
 darkhorse64: Send me your uttt code. I'll tell you
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that kinda thing can make a difference jacek
 jacek: some people may read the code
 leojean890: 120k rollouts is enormous&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: humongous 
 darkhorse64: The engine is so simple
 jacek: oh, never did true avx. maybe i should start
 darkhorse64: avx does not help or I suck at it. My avx is slower
 Astrobytes: It's not the easiest thing in the world
 leojean890: ErisSMSO maybe good to go W1 as well^^
 jacek: maybe Astrobytes wont be last after all
 leojean890: EricSMSO *
 leojean890: all W2 people are behind so..^^
 blanit: yo guys
 blanit: everyone*
 AntiSquid: anyone
 jacek: everypony
 blanit: i need some help here, gonna be testes in this site for a position. Whats the best path to do in 4 days?
 blanit: tested*
 Astrobytes: jacek: nah, I expect that to be last until I fix my MCTS version
 AntiSquid: upload an avatar, player botters
 EricSMSO: I cross fingers
 blanit: x)
 leojean890: you're not far Eric&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: boss 25.5
 AntiSquid: that's why everyone who asks how to prepare fails blanit
 blanit: just want to pratice, dont be so judmental
 blanit: jugmental 
 AntiSquid: yes practice
 blanit: judgemental
 darkhorse64: he is kidding you
 AntiSquid: why the smiley then
 AntiSquid: you can play clobber, see if you get at least wood 1
 Tuo: that is some evil advice
 darkhorse64: practice puzzles
 AntiSquid: if you want to pass a test prepare for the worst, nothing evil 
 blanit: yup doing some puzzels was just asking if there was some path of something
 AntiSquid: do the path on the landing page
 darkhorse64: There is the quest map
 leojean890: practice puzzles or reach gold on multis^^
 EricSMSO: Yes&#160;! Now  let's try to uncomment #pragma
 leojean890: gg&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: Why uncomment&#160;?
 blanit: ty for the help!
 Scarfield: Astrobytes behold my superiot paint skills <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/10nithg">https://prnt.sc/10nithg</a>
 EricSMSO: Because I forgot to uncomment itat first run
 AntiSquid: try gimp it's free Scarfield
 darkhorse64: What a serious kick!
 Kaukdsv: Hi
 Kaukdsv: Is there someone here now?
 jacek: maybe
 Scarfield: potentially
 Kaukdsv:&#160;:(
 Kaukdsv: What language do you use/know?
 AntiSquid: why singular&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Hahaha! My dude. I will change my avatar immendiately :D
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Or immediately.
 AntiSquid: Scarfield starting his pimp my cg avatar show soon
 struct: The more I code the less I know
 Scarfield: i am the artist of 4 now i think
 darkhorse64: Kaukdsv: C++. Python is also very popular here
 leojean890: python, easier.. C++ more powerful
 blanit: no go?
 struct: More important than knowing a language is knowing how to program
 leojean890: go less known 
 Astrobytes: What struct said. 100%
 AntiSquid: JavaScript is my favourite because so many people hate it while I like it.
 Astrobytes: When you know what's happening behind the scenes, you can learn most languages fairly quickly
 darkhorse64: As people say, use the right tool, the one you are confortable with and appropriate to the tasks. You have an ample choice of 25 (27?) languages 
 blanit: is good to know to know general programming but langagues and diff purposes and specifics so its also good to focus on a few
 blanit: serve not and sry
 blanit: but yeah first focus on learn to program
 AntiSquid: hey Scarfield just a suggestion/challenge, make cover arts for clobber / paper soccer / breakthrough and have them accepted :P
 AntiSquid: art *
 jacek: :3
 AntiSquid: i mean without it nobody will even notice there's a football game
 Scarfield: maybe, but i make these silly avatars for the chuckle, if i were to make coverart for games, it would probably have to be more serious
 jacek: try one for tvc
 AntiSquid: it's ok, just charge them money for it
 Scarfield: there was mention of a pretty cool sketching tool a few weeks ago, not gimp though
 AntiSquid: paint 3D&#160;? :P
 Scarfield: ew, you cannot improve paint
 AntiSquid: sketchbook&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Krita?
 Scarfield: krita yes
 jacek: made in kotlin?
 AntiSquid: oh krita is available on ubuntu too 
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes has lost 1st last place
 AntiSquid: where
 AntiSquid: clobber?
 Astrobytes: Oof. 
 Astrobytes: Not for long if I go by recent experience :P
 darkhorse64: Give some tips to EricSMSO
 Astrobytes: I only give tips if you're stuck in the lower league :D
 Astrobytes: And if you can give me good ones in return :P
 darkhorse64: Fast bitboard engine, MCTS, solver
 Astrobytes: I know all that
 darkhorse64: I have no heuristic at all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tmi, inserting your tips into the weak
 Astrobytes: I just haven't finished writing my MCTS. I planned to try EPT first
 jacek: curious how ms' meta turned out
 jacek: for ept you need heuristics :c
 Astrobytes: Who you calling weak Patrick. darkhorse can insert his tips into whomever he likes :P
 Scarfield: just the tip?
 Astrobytes: jacek: there are heuristics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fingers, ===)  whatever...tmi
 leojean890: I'm keeping my alphabeta for now and trying stuff xD
 darkhorse64: I try to keep my integrity
 Astrobytes: And his meta was not great iirc jacek
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: I have two kids: that's enough
 Astrobytes: Not like you to lower the tone at all Patrick :P
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tomorrow is st. patricks day, I'm warming up
 Astrobytes: leojean890: alphabeta is enough
 Astrobytes: for the next league I mean
 kovi: why clobber is more popular than chess?
 Astrobytes: chess is far more involved
 leojean890: yeah but I have to give up python and improve my eval xD
 Astrobytes: clobber sim is 5 minute job
 AntiSquid: ppl hate castle
 leojean890: chess implies mass investment
 darkhorse64: 27 people: not that popular
 leojean890: you need more time 
 leojean890: so maybe one day more people will have time
 Astrobytes: Why does breakthrough have so many people?
 leojean890: because it's been available for long
 leojean890: like vindinium
 leojean890: dots and bots it's because it's user friendly and looks easier
 Astrobytes: Hm. Perhaps darkhorse64 should add a boss so it can be POTW and get even more.
 darkhorse64: Simple engine, some tactics&#160;?
 darkhorse64: It has already been potw
 Astrobytes: How did that work?
 darkhorse64: Quite well. It doubles the number of people
 darkhorse64: doubled
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but they can't get the achievement because of only one league
 darkhorse64: It was pre quest map
 Astrobytes: Ah yes, ofc
 jacek: :soccer: was also potw, during contest :unamused:
 leojean890: potw helps, but some were potw and are still unpopular
 AntiSquid: made me giggle, i still remember
 leojean890: blocking or fireworks don't have many people yet
 darkhorse64: it did not work for fireworks and tryangle
 leojean890: penguins or D&amp;B or 2048 were hugely valorized 
 leojean890: by POTW
 Astrobytes: blocking movegen is insane and fireworks requires some time to understand. Tryangle is a game that requires some invested time
 darkhorse64: ^
 leojean890: I didn't do tryangle and blocking for the moment btw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think clobber can be optimized for play using a number generator
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it would be hard to find
 leojean890: yeah Astrobytes they are not easy
 AntiSquid: fireworks is only hard because of the inputs
 leojean890: blocking huge branching, chess idem, tryangle idem...
 Scarfield: idem?
 leojean890: idem = same for
 Astrobytes: It's like saying what you've just said 
 Scarfield: Indiana Department of Environmental Management
 Scarfield: never seen that expression before
 Astrobytes: Blocking huge branching, chess huge branching, tryangle etc etc
 leojean890: idem maybe is french idk
 Scarfield: latin
 leojean890: but I use this in french&#160;;)
 kovi: maybe not all requires game tree...
 Astrobytes: I've used it in writing papers and stuff
 leojean890: blocking huge branching, same for chess, same for tryangle...
 kovi: altough im still having  trouble beating boss with no tree...
 leojean890: maybe heuristics without game tree may be ok
 kovi: chess
 jacek: huge branching factor isnt problem. making a sim is
 leojean890: chess maybe depth 2 would be ok with good eval for W1&#160;?^^
 Theino: blocking huge branching, chess Indiana Department of Environmental Management, tryangle Indiana Department of Environmental Management
 leojean890: Theino trolling ;P
 Scarfield: how close to the boos kovi?
 jacek: afaik chess boss is 1ply material
 Scarfield: and the boss
 Astrobytes: Or maybe weaker eval and more depth
 Theino: we Americans are serious about our Indiana Department of Environmental Management
 leojean890: huge branching may be a problem, because needs to deal with it^^
 Astrobytes: yeah jacek, material eval with 2-3 depth should be enough (I think)
 Scarfield: iirc re curse said depth 2 material for chess boss
 leojean890: with heuristics for example
 EricSMSO: So Astrobytes, give me the tips; please
 kovi: scarfield: almost 2. im still &lt;40%
 jacek: well i advanced league when i hadnt castling or en passant yet
 Astrobytes: EricSMSO: You don't get any since you're no longer in the bottom league :P
 Scarfield: ye me too, and only 1 ply eval
 AntiSquid: k what's quickest way to upper league Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;--1D board eval, if you can't beat my chess bot u aren't trying
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: good eval
 Scarfield: boss is boosted again i guess, but nice to see another chess player&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: think outside the box
 AntiSquid: for clobber you mean&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The eval may not be the most intuitive
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 AntiSquid: just wanted to know if there's a quick way, doing something else atm
 leojean890: there are some papers which could help ^^
 leojean890: I saw them really fast
 Astrobytes: Actually, to advance to next league I would ignore the papers
 kovi: i need to add knight fork/check
 leojean890: only a powerful MCTS with many sims;p
 Astrobytes: I made it with alphabeta
 kovi: that is too strong...and its not immediate effect
 jacek: spoon?
 Astrobytes: spork jacek
 leojean890: or .. a powerful alphabeta with many sims and a good eval
 Astrobytes: Now you're talking 
 Coder_DaYan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/17ba16b8-db73-4c3c-b8ee-2a1c46c0326f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/17ba16b8-db73-4c3c-b8ee-2a1c46c0326f</a>
 Astrobytes: alphabeta, some move ordering, TT
 leojean890: my eval is bad, mostly checking the number of pawns which can move per player^^
 Coder_DaYan: why does this code not work?
 leojean890: (not the number of moves)
 Astrobytes: That's a useful addition
 AntiSquid: because you wrote it twice Coder_DaYan
 leojean890: it's a very light eval^^
 Astrobytes: There's something else you can evaluate too leojean890, look at the neighbourhood of your pawns
 Scarfield: yea, you want your pawns to live in a good neighbourhood
 Coder_DaYan: no, I just copied it wrong AntiSquid
 leojean890: number of neighbors which are my own/adv/empty pawns&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I'll let you work it out leojean890
 leojean890: ok hehe
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Scarfield: you arent on the leaderboard though leoIdem
 AntiSquid: sell them at the pawn shop
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 leojean890: I'm 2nd W2 Scarfield 
 jacek: Coder_DaYan and what puzzle is that
 Scarfield: xD thought you were talking chess
 leojean890: clobber;)
 Coder_DaYan: It`s the Horse-racing Duals Puzzle
 leojean890: chess, I'll see that later, it takes too much time&#160;!
 Astrobytes: ^
 Coder_DaYan: The code passes the first and second tests
 Coder_DaYan: but not the third
 Astrobytes: And better to bitboard chess from the start rather than start with arrays and whatnot
 jacek: as i copied, the code doesnt pass any test o.O
 Coder_DaYan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/001f6a6b-d9e7-4089-a40c-cc02dd0c7bd2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/001f6a6b-d9e7-4089-a40c-cc02dd0c7bd2</a>
 Coder_DaYan: this code?
 AntiSquid: optimize it
 jacek: ah oops, not this puzzle ^^
 jacek: yeah, code works but is slow
 AntiSquid: check time complexity
 jacek: you have two loops, N*N operations
 Astrobytes: Ditch a for loop and figure out how to save some info that you can use
 Coder_DaYan: and what info could I use with just one for loop
 Astrobytes: That's what you have to figure out
 jacek: you have hints on the left
 Astrobytes: leojean890: either do some insane pruning or don't use python :P
 Coder_DaYan: OK thank you
 Suez17: who finished the Bender exercise&#160;?
 Coder_DaYan: I think I have an idea that could work:do you have to sort them all according to size and then only compare the neighboring numbers?
 Scarfield: good idea
 Coder_DaYan: would that work?
 Scarfield: depends on how much time your sorting takes, but yes
 Astrobytes: Try it and see&#160;;)
 Coder_DaYan: OK, thank you very much for the help, I'll give it a try
 leojean890: Astrobytes I know about python xD but need a beter eval as well :p
 Astrobytes: leojean890: fair point&#160;:)
 jacek: i know this eval: if (win) +inf else if (lose) -inf
 leojean890: better*
 Scarfield: else ±inf
 leojean890: Astrobytes my eval is&#160;: 10*(nbPawnsThatCanMove - nbEnemyPawnsThatCanMove) + nbValidMovesAtMyMaxDepth - nbEnemyValidMovesAtHisMaxDepth
 leojean890: I'll think about your idea of watching my pawns neighborhood 
 Tuo: i did defended pawns when i was still evaluating boards
 Astrobytes: leojean890: yes, prioritise the pawn neighbourhoods in the eval though
 Tuo: as in pawn that can move and has own pawn neighbour
 leojean890: defended&#160;?
 leojean890: oh ok
 leojean890: so if the enemy eats you..
 leojean890: you can eat him back
 Tuo: y&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I am saying nothing further. tric paid for this info with a trade.You get nothing for free :P
 leojean890: because you have a own neighbor
 leojean890: XD
 jacek: he paid for paper?
 leojean890: I saw this drawing in a paper
 leojean890: a drawing showing how they studied the problem
 leojean890: and they considered this case
 leojean890: analyze if you can eat back
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't think too deeply is the advice I would give you right now.
 Astrobytes: It's simpler than you think.
 Astrobytes: To get to the next league I mean.
 leojean890: yeah ;P
 leojean890: or MCTS xd
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed
 Coder_DaYan: thank you so much. I have now tried it and it worked well
 Astrobytes: Coder_DaYan: excellent&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Now use that kind of thinking in future puzzles, it will help
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 ENTITY303: cool
 ENTITY303: awesom

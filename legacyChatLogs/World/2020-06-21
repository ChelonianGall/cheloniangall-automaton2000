 imbadpython: i feel like clash of code problems quality are dropping
 imbadpython: so many are like tedious
 PurCHES5: yep too easy
 PurCHES5: It was way harder back in the day
 imbadpython: yes
 TheSpiffiest: Does anyone do these in Rust?
 imbadpython: @mafiron wtf&#160;;-;
 imbadpython: i think a lot do in ruby (especially for shortest/code golf) 
 imbadpython: rust idk
 TheSpiffiest: As frustrating as that damn compiler is I think I might do it to get faster
 TheSpiffiest: I just started.  The first few I got 0% because I didn't really get where all the buttons and tests were
 imbadpython: nice
 TheSpiffiest: Have any of you gotten jobs from here?
 vuhoanganh: :v
 vuhoanganh: ez game&#160;?
 vuhoanganh: where are u from&#160;?
 Zerplin: anyone done the Dice probability calculator puzzle?
 vuhoanganh: ML&#160;?
 Zerplin: how did you get started on parsing the arithmetic expression
 imbadpython: what do you mean
 imbadpython: use a stack
 Zerplin: did you do the Dice probability calculator
 Zerplin: puzzle?
 imbadpython: yes
 imbadpython: well no but ik how to do
 imbadpython: let me do real quick
 imbadpython: have you learned stack before?
 imbadpython: if not just look it up
 imbadpython: or this
 imbadpython: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm</a>
 Zerplin: i know about stack
 imbadpython: ye so you first parse it into reverse polish notation
 imbadpython: with a queue and stack
 imbadpython: then use a stack to evaluate
 imbadpython: and just loop through all d4
 imbadpython: that's how i do it might be overcomplicating it xD
 imbadpython: if you using python this can help you 
 imbadpython: s = input()for t in '+-*&gt;':
 Zerplin: using c# atm
 imbadpython: oh then just ye do sth similar
 imbadpython: there are other ways
 Zerplin: yeah, was maybe thinking some recurssion 
 imbadpython: in python i can probably use eval but ill do it proper way
 imbadpython: ill send you code
 imbadpython: one sec
 Zerplin: it's tempting to use js or python, but i'm doing the puzzle to get better at c#
 MinhNhut: :joy:
 imbadpython: im struggling&#160;;-;
 imbadpython: maybe i should just use eval &gt;:(
 imbadpython: why the fuck are there brackets
 imbadpython: ye ok good luck man
 imbadpython: &lt;3
 Zerplin: brackets?
 Zerplin: do you mean parantheses?
 imbadpython: ye
 TheSpiffiest: Ah, learning
 TheSpiffiest: Didn't realize python title was the same as capitalize
 imbadpython: title capitalizes each letter after space as well
 imbadpython: capitalize only does it for the start
 imbadpython: so "abc def".capitalize is "Abc def"
 imbadpython: but "abc def".title is "Abc Def"
 imbadpython: I think
 imbadpython: pretty sure
 anid: Yes
 imbadpython: cool
 TheSpiffiest: I could have done the whole snake cake to camel case in one liner now
 TheSpiffiest: s[0]+s.replace("_"," ").title().replace(" ","")[1:]
 TheSpiffiest: I did a for loop for each word
 imbadpython: what's the quesiton
 imbadpython: just give an example i think i can guess it
 TheSpiffiest: convert snake_case to camelCase
 imbadpython: xd
 imbadpython: oo
 imbadpython: ye yours is good
 TheSpiffiest: some_long_variables_ to to someLongVariables
 imbadpython: debugging is gay
 imbadpython: you too
 tomatoes: no need for splitting by space
 tomatoes: "some_long_variables".title() = "Some_Long_Variables"
 TheSpiffiest: Even better
 TheSpiffiest: s[0]+s.title().replace("_","")[1:]
 imbadpython: holy shit im done
 imbadpython: dice probability calculator :D
 imbadpython: lmao
 imbadpython: took long enough
 imbadpython: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/yynEZzb6">https://pastebin.com/yynEZzb6</a> code review anyone
 imbadpython: i am the second person to implement the evaluation function instead of using eval in python lmao
 imbadpython: kinda waste of time
 badAtCoding: imbadpython youre skilled
 imbadpython: hmm
 imbadpython: i guess you too then
 badAtCoding: nope
 badAtCoding: how long youve been doing py?
 RAPHI: Is it just my internet or is Coc validaton really slow today&#160;?
 Alexle: i need helpy help with this tic-tac-toe thing
 gloomix: Hey guys. I'm doing the ANEO sponsored puzzle and quite frankly I think their test cases are wrong.
 gloomix: anybody else had that feeling?
 imbadpython: its correct
 tanmaycodernovice: RAPHI well done.. just 7 escond gap 
 Alexle: need help with the ASCII art one in the easy section
 tanmaycodernovice: same 
 tanmaycodernovice: me too 
 Alexle: the hint doesn't help too
 tanmaycodernovice: exactly
 tanmaycodernovice: how is scoring based in this 
 tanmaycodernovice: coc
 DJZombieMysteryInSpace_6e20: Hello!&#160;:)
 Tim_McSim: Such a lovely place this is!
 jacek: where
 Tim_McSim: This website.
 jacek: really :o
 tanmaycodernovice: 247Output2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47
 tanmaycodernovice: can someone code this
 HaBao: hi
 jacek: prime numbers?
 tanmaycodernovice: print the prime numbers between these 2 number 
 tanmaycodernovice: yes
 tanmaycodernovice: i'm using print(num,end=' ') which is orpinting a space at the end 
 tanmaycodernovice: as a result unable to pass test cases
 Tim_McSim: I'm pretty new in programming, but having so much fun solving the puzzles.
 jacek: so add those numbers to the temporary string and print(string.strip())
 tanmaycodernovice: now its over actually 
 tanmaycodernovice: but thanks 
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: maybe do it yourself next time tanmaycodernovice, so ungrateful

 Uljahn: Automaton2000: who are you?
 Automaton2000: was just curious if anyone has any idea what the problem is that my code is
 -Gamma-: Automaton2000, where are you?
 Automaton2000: i didn't use it in the right direction?
 -Gamma-: you didnt 
 NgonTran: hello everyone
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: hey guys, I have a question about oware
 MSmits: if you are playing your last turn
 MSmits: does it matter that the opponent can't do a move after that?
 MSmits: can you play moves that leave the opponent with no move of his own
 MSmits: also when there is no such moves, does he lose all his seeds even though the game has ended?
 MSmits: by last turn i mean turn 200 of course
 jacek: you dont read statements? :V
 MSmits: does it say this?
 darkhorse64: You cannot  play a move that starves your opponent. If your opponent is strarved you must play a move that feeds him. The opponent loses all remaining seeds to not his own
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but what if there is no next turn
 MSmits: i am talking about the last turn of the game
 jacek: i think the seeds are not capturd in last turn
 MSmits: yes, but you dont know for sure
 MSmits: how do we know for sure
 jacek: replay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/473431216">https://www.codingame.com/replay/473431216</a>
 MSmits: doesnt tell me anything
 darkhorse64: I understand your question. Does these rules aplly on the very last turn. Honestly, I do not know. And I do not know whether the referee enforces these rules on the very last turn
 jacek: in the replay, 200 turn occurs and the final score without seeds in houses is final
 MSmits: yes but you did not try to play a move that leaves the opponent no move
 MSmits: also you did not capture all his seeds because he had no move on turn 201
 MSmits: so you didnt test it
 jacek: oh hmm
 MSmits: this is really an implementation detail for which we need to see the referee
 darkhorse64: ^
 Astrobytes: The referee is linked in the forum thread
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: will go look at it
 jacek: oware is so last week. do othello
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits:  i will eventually&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit, catch you guys later
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ad07e2f-eba6-44cc-b119-e2a85bf542fa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ad07e2f-eba6-44cc-b119-e2a85bf542fa</a>
 MSmits: I think this says that you cant play actions that leave the opponent without a move, even if it is the last move you make because of turn limit
 MSmits: so that answers my first question
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7a8d6dd-1ac5-419b-a342-f5648b93d35f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7a8d6dd-1ac5-419b-a342-f5648b93d35f</a>
 MSmits: this says that the last turn you still get to capture all his seeds
 MSmits: even if he doesnt need to move after that
 MSmits: so there is no exception needed for the last turn
 dbdr: MSmits: to know for sure, read the referee source&#160;:)
 dbdr: sorry, you are&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, i didnt at first know there was a shared referee
 MSmits: because its not in the statement
 MSmits: which is a bit weird
 jacek: they wanted to hide boss
 jacek:&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea
 jacek: and yet im 2nd :F <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/sQi7Qsr.png">https://i.imgur.com/sQi7Qsr.png</a>
 darkhorse64: resubmit
 MSmits: this is othello?
 darkhorse64: Yep
 MSmits: cool
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: no mcts
 MSmits: why not
 MSmits: you said no mcts on Onitama :P
 jacek: im too dump to reliably incorporate eval to mcts
 MSmits: maybe you dont need eval
 jacek: i think it worked in oware by accident
 jacek: given how fixed are my replays with agade
 MSmits: oware is extremely RPS
 MSmits: but eval surely works
 MSmits: mcts with eval that is
 eulerscheZahl: give up and play another gmae
 eulerscheZahl: game
 MSmits: yavalath?
 imbadpython: what you guys talking about
 jacek: yinsh
 struct: hello
 MostComplicatedUsername: jrke what's episode 2 of lost child???? He gets even more lost?????
 MSmits: maybe he gets lost in a different way?
 MSmits: first he is just lost
 MSmits: the second time people "lose" him
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol
 jacek: lost The Game
 Astrobytes: The Game?
 Astrobytes: hey jacek, how the hell are you not 1st yet
 jacek: i can win with tric but i started to lose with losers
 jacek: like some cat
 jacek: but not to worry, i pulled him down a little bit
 Astrobytes: Hey it's only like 1 game per submit :PYou timed out against Eric too
 jacek: time out?
 jacek: oh yeah
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: im using 145ms
 jacek: i wish it said if this is some error or really timeout
 Astrobytes: Server maybe
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's super annoying
 Astrobytes: Does it affect your bot much if you reduce to 140?
 jacek: dunno
 Astrobytes: cause most of the spikes due to the server are less than 10ms usually
 struct: Is this spike issue recent?
 Astrobytes: No, it's pretty constant. I remember it was really bad for a while, when we were getting huge spikes in CSB
 struct: Its strange
 struct: I use all the time allowed in uttt and stc
 struct: and no timeouts
 Astrobytes: Just a few ms here and there
 eulerscheZahl: hi struct. you reported a bug at uploading a contribution. did it get fixed?
 struct: I think so
 eulerscheZahl: "Please wait, we are building your project..."
 struct: It worked past a few hours
 struct: I guess its random&#160;:(
 struct: report it again I guess
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 zizo1337: It seems in C# Function Append of Stack&lt;T&gt; does not do anything.
 zizo1337: Tried that locally too.
 jacek: append on stack? not push?
 zizo1337: Push works.
 Astrobytes: ...
 jacek:&#160;???
 jacek: i left to 140ms
 imbadpython: what you guys talking about
 imbadpython: also can someone look at my contribution? (clash of code challenge) i don't understand why it's downvoted so much
 imbadpython: and no one has given constructive feedback at all yet
 Astrobytes: Good score jacek, still losing to tric a fair bit though
 jacek: still im too afraid i may cause him to rage quit
 imbadpython: what competition you guys talking about
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Othello imbadpython
 jacek: the game, not the puzzle
 Astrobytes: Multiplayer not a contest
 struct: Does he still find win before you jacek?
 imbadpython: is the game about execution speed
 imbadpython: sounds hard
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/othello-1">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/othello-1</a>
 MSmits: why would you cause tric trac to rage quit jacek?
 MSmits: he seems emotionally stable&#160;?
 imbadpython: is AlkhilJohn a bot
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 imbadpython: oh
 Astrobytes: imbadpython, read this. It explains why there are bots in clashes:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/</a>
 imbadpython: ahhh
 imbadpython: that's pretty cool
 imbadpython: "I understand it can be frustrating to play against people who manage to complete a Clash in less than 20 seconds, but there is most likely no cheating involved." shit that sounds exactly like me
 imbadpython: also the captcha is kinda bad
 imbadpython: isn'tt here like captcha v3 
 imbadpython: like auto captcha
 Astrobytes: imbadpython The captcha is there to prevent people writing bots to auto-submit solutions
 imbadpython: ye but doesn't google have captcha v3
 imbadpython: you don't need to click images anymore
 imbadpython: its like it looks at your cursor movement or sth
 imbadpython: cuz the images i swear captcha takes more time than the actual CoC round
 Astrobytes: It is what it is.
 imbadpython: like i mean they can just update it
 imbadpython: but ok
 jacek: MSmits of course, this is only explanation why im losing to him... *ekhm* why i still allow him to win with me
 jacek: struct i think we find the win/lose at the same time
 jrke: im trying to add sim in PCR can any body make me explain its physics
 eulerscheZahl: sure: how do physics work? explain it to me!
 jacek: if we only had physics teacher in the chat :thinking:
 jrke: i mean what is movement etc
 eulerscheZahl: or jacek in the box
 eulerscheZahl: "can any body make me explain"the stage is yours, start explaining
 jrke: i mean what is movement *speed* etc
 eulerscheZahl: seems i can't make him explain&#160;:(
 jrke: :slight_smile:
 jacek: D:
 TheSpiffiest: Speed is distance per unit of time
 jacek: finally! :tada:
 jrke: no the speed used in PCR 
 jrke: i know Speed=distance/time
 jacek: uh oh tric responds
 Astrobytes: gg anyway jacek
 TheSpiffiest: For which meaning of PCR?
 TheSpiffiest: I'm thinking polymerase chain reaction in genetics 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/poker-chip-race">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/poker-chip-race</a>
 Astrobytes: tric's submit is not looking good for you jacek
 dbdr: trictrac did you have something ready, waiting for jacek to take #1?
 trictrac: yes
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure that's a yes
 Astrobytes: ah lol
 dbdr: :smirk:
 jacek: you fool! this isnt my final form!
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Very strong bots, both of you
 Astrobytes: nice work
 JoachimNapias1: Hi, in the section "Learn" when i click on a "run" it put waiting indefinitely
 jacek: puzzle?
 JoachimNapias1: it is just on my computer?
 jacek: try to refresh page
 Astrobytes: Learn takes you to tech.io
 Astrobytes: well, the tech.io content
 Astrobytes: JoachimNapias1 try going to tech.io and running it there
 JoachimNapias1: i try but same effect&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Do any of them work? (try another playground other than the one you're trying now)
 Astrobytes: Title defended successfully jacek, gg
 jacek: good, im not gonna rage quit
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: maybe if i learned how to play othello, it would be better :thinking:
 trictrac: I have an other parameter to try I will resubmit
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: Interesting.  I'm still doing pod racing... I don't know PCR yet, but I'll figure that out this week.&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: I'm going to have to implement bezier curves to win the races I think
 Snef: what league are you&#160;?
 TheSpiffiest: bronze right now, but just started this morning
 TheSpiffiest: just tweaking paramters
 jacek: :s
 struct: dark horse64 just sent me the boss, I will add it soon
 Astrobytes: better improve now jacek
 dbdr: was that the boss that was better than his main bot?
 Astrobytes: That's a *very* strong submit by trictrac
 dbdr: after removing features?
 Astrobytes: nice struct
 struct: I dont know dbd r
 Astrobytes: Looking good dbdr!
 darkhorse64: To make a long story short, there is something fishy with my solver. When I remove it, it make my bot stronger.
 darkhorse64: *makes*
 dbdr: thanks Astrobytes!
 Astrobytes: That's not really what a solver is supposed to do darkhorse64 :P
 dbdr: debugging time darkhorse64
 b1l4l: {
 struct: "Please wait, we are building your project..."&#160;:(
 struct: Still happens
 Astrobytes: Have you been saving this bot for the right moment dbdr? :D
 darkhorse64: I spent the afternoon on it without success. That's the main issue with MCTS: it's very hard to debug when it goes wrong
 dbdr: yes, learning from trictrac&#160;;)
 trictrac: dbdr your bot seems to work good&#160;!!
 jacek: :F
 Astrobytes: gg man, well played
 dbdr: also, I have a huge bug in my eval
 Astrobytes: God help us all
 dbdr: I *had*
 Astrobytes: Ah
 dbdr: unfortunately :D
 jacek: mcts?
 dbdr: minimax
 struct: I guess the boss submit wont happen today
 struct: Since cg is stuck again
 dbdr: struct: eulerscheZahl was saying this happens
 struct: yeah
 struct: same happened last week
 dbdr: just need to retry
 struct: nah
 struct: "OupsAn error occurred (#INVALID_PARAMETERS): "Invalid parameters"."
 Astrobytes: Time to delete
 struct: O.o
 jacek: restart account
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: Ok now its tottaly broken
 Astrobytes: invalid parameters are "invalid parameters", interesting
 darkhorse64: You break CG&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hey it's pretty good at doing that by itself
 struct: Do you also want the wood 2 boss to be the default AI?
 struct: or it doesn't matter?
 Astrobytes: That's a good idea I think
 jacek: i feel so noob :c
 dbdr: is that an insult jacek?&#160;;)
 Reksio:&#160;:)
 dbdr: (towards me I mean)
 jacek: how can i lose to such lowlings!?
 Astrobytes: lol rekt
 dbdr: :innocent:
 jacek: phew
 dbdr: gonna be close
 Astrobytes: lol, it heard you
 dbdr: or not
 Astrobytes: Very strong submit regardless, gg
 dbdr: I lost to "lowlings"&#160;;)
 dbdr: yes, happy to have made it work finally
 struct: Boss will be a quite strong too
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I meant to ask, is this boss gonna destroy everyone except #1
 jacek: i dont remember submiting boss, so no
 dbdr: add solver to the boss to weaken it&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 struct: Will top 8 be too strong?
 struct: for first league?
 struct: I dont want to add multiple 
 jacek: imo boss should be just better than random moves
 Astrobytes: You were going for around 30pts cutoff no?
 dbdr: I like strong bosses
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: Maybe top 10?
 Astrobytes: Sense of achievement
 dbdr: nice challenge, even if you don't compete for the top 3
 dbdr: not many people have really worked on it yet
 dbdr: level will improve
 struct: I guess you are right
 struct: I will leave it as it is
 struct: I don't have any game ready yet after this
 struct: I have prototype of Amazons
 struct: But I'm currently working on other stuff
 jacek: i submitted good bot and suddenly there are bunch better
 Astrobytes: All good struct, take your time and prioritise what you have to!
 Astrobytes: jacek - they were waiting in the shadows for you
 struct: Just wait until Msmits submit
 struct: :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: At least you have a few weeks before that
 struct: Is he a fan of minimax though?
 struct: mcts doesnt seem to be doing so well here
 simpledark: yo guys
 jacek: mcts isnt thing for othell until MSmits will come
 TheSpiffiest: silver league yeah!&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: What does 
 TheSpiffiest: Do I have to do anything or is it going to put me in gold in an hour?
 darkhorse64: Just wait
 darkhorse64: pcr ,
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: CSB
 Astrobytes: Someone found -3vel
 Astrobytes: :P
 darkhorse64: Yet another 1000 promotions&#160;?
 struct: TheSpiffiest you have to wait 1 hour
 Astrobytes: Server death incoming 
 TheSpiffiest: Thanks.  I'll play some other games I guess. I like this site.
 NASADeveloper102: I finally submitted my bot for Ghost in the Cell.
 Astrobytes: gg TheSpiffiest
 Astrobytes: nice NASADeveloper102
 Astrobytes: How is it?
 NASADeveloper102: It's....
 NASADeveloper102: Buggy, but I'll fix it later.
 Astrobytes: Well, Rome wasn't built in a day and all that
 NASADeveloper102: I guess.
 TheSpiffiest: NASADeveloper102 - are you actually working for NASA? Any interesting projects?&#160;:)
 NASADeveloper102: No, I aspire to work there though.
 struct: Must solve mars lander
 dbdr: struct: why is the puzzle name othello-1?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, get on the Mars Lander series
 TheSpiffiest: Same here.&#160;:)
 NASADeveloper102: What is the Mars Lander series?
 struct: dbdr because there is already a puzzle named othello&#160;:(
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/othello">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/othello</a>
 dbdr: oh. no big deal!
 TheSpiffiest: Interviewing for Astrobotic soon I hope! 🤞 
 Astrobytes: In puzzles section NASADeveloper102, there's Episode 1 2 and 3. Increasing difficulty. Also theres an optimization game based on it
 jacek: its a big deal, its a direct ripoff of that puzzle!
 jacek: they even have the same background
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 NASADeveloper102: But you never actually explained what it is.
 Astrobytes: It's what it says. Land the lander on 'Mars'&#160;;)
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 TheSpiffiest: Ha! It's the old lunar lander game from like 1980
 Astrobytes: First one is ridiculously easy, after that they get more fun
 NASADeveloper102: Okay. I'll check it out.
 TheSpiffiest: I have a friend at NASA, he's helping me train for a contractor position.  I guess they use low level C for everything, which kinda sucks.
 Astrobytes: Well, there's a lot of assembly used, alongside FORTRAN, as well as C
 jacek: you know what doesnt suck...
 Astrobytes: Vacuum cleaner made in...
 TheSpiffiest: his specific project is converting OpenCV libraries to radhard stuff for computer vision based docking
 Astrobytes: Nice
 jacek: oh todays celestia day
 Astrobytes: wtf is that
 TheSpiffiest: like going backwards, no classes, no boost, just pointers and and includes
 jacek: longest day in year
 Astrobytes: Summer solstice
 jacek: eeyup
 TheSpiffiest: aw poop I'm supposed to run today
 Astrobytes: You and your MLP jacek
 jacek: i dont use multilayer perceptrons
 Astrobytes: ...
 reCurse: The only sane use of this acronym
 Astrobytes: Hey, he's the brony, don't look at me
 derjack: who
 Astrobytes: lol ffs man
 Astrobytes: Hmm dbdr and tomatoes submitting at the same time, it's a Rust conspiracy I tell thee
 dbdr: :sunglasses:
 tomatoes: it's sure is
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: nice improvement anyway tomatoes
 jacek: :E
 Astrobytes: dbdr is destroying you jacek. Fix it
 jacek: because i let him
 Astrobytes: Right, rage quit and all that
 JBM: how is ur csb
 jacek: meh my eval still isnt perfect
 jacek: 0.7+ for win, then next move and proven loss
 Astrobytes: What are you eval'ing
 jacek: the board :v
 Astrobytes: I mean like there's a whole bunch of stuff
 Astrobytes: That you can use
 jacek: confguration and tanh it as winning probability
 jacek: well discs and ther positions
 Astrobytes: available moves, stability..?
 jacek: N-tuple network learned via temporal difference
 Astrobytes: hah really?
 jacek: it works wonders for i.e. 2048 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf">http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf</a>
 jacek: im too dumb to make fast stability disc check or frontiers
 jacek: i showed you my eval the other day didnt i
 Astrobytes: frontiers isn't hard
 jacek: oh my dbdr
 dbdr: I think it's mosty luck
 dbdr: mostly
 Astrobytes: fkin hell man lol
 eulerscheZahl: luck of others to not get completely crushed
 jacek: someone isnt giving up
 Astrobytes: tric never gives up :D
 jacek: its breakthrough all over again
 struct: oh well
 struct: too bad I cant submit the boss&#160;:(
 struct: Did you manage to upload euler?
 Astrobytes: Failing, failing so hard! :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/473874462">https://www.codingame.com/replay/473874462</a>
 jacek: wow you knew its loss so soon
 Astrobytes: ha ha
 darkhorse64: Looks like dbdr seriously pissed off trictrac.
 Astrobytes: Seriously.
 Astrobytes: That's insane.
 dbdr: if opponent == "dbdr" {
 darkhorse64: Improvement: beMerciless()
 Astrobytes: More like, if (opponent) wreck();
 dbdr: lol
 Astrobytes: trictrac :clap:
 trictrac: thanks
 trictrac: I introduce TT and reduce pruning
 Astrobytes: You did all that before without TT?!
 trictrac: yes
 Astrobytes: Just eval and a/b?
 Astrobytes: (obviously eval)
 trictrac: and ordering heuristic
 Astrobytes: Impressive man, very impressive
 Snef: what is TT&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Transposition table Snef
 trictrac: Transpostion Table&#160;: mémorisation of alphabet result
 trictrac: alphabeta
 trictrac: based on key of the board
 Astrobytes: hashtable with attitude
 struct: transposition tables
 PatrickMcGinnisII: NASADeveloper102 I tried to work there and for all the subcontractors back in '92, there was a hiring freeze and people with degrees were forced to work in very menial jobs ... it ruined my life's dreams.  Wish u luck, but don't get your heart broken.
 Astrobytes: Only an hour late there Paddy&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea i saw that, but says they still in chat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes that replay hurts, too much white
 Astrobytes: lol, I got "rekt"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fixin to do my first submit
 LelouchVC2: and i got erectile disfunction
 Astrobytes: *dysfunction. Corrected just for you LelouchVC2, as I know you love it
 LelouchVC2: my bad, erectile defunktable
 Astrobytes: I still reckon you should switch to C or something PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: I know you love your PHP and all but... realise the potential.
 LelouchVC2: C++ &gt; C
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't do much with MCTS in php, but I can score the board after a few depths
 Astrobytes: Yeah, nobody's gonna bite Lelouch
 LelouchVC2: That's not even a troll comment
 LelouchVC2: just facts
 Astrobytes: Whereas in C, you definitely could. So... not hard to port your code PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't make me pull out the asm
 LelouchVC2: As soon as I got use to assembly they made us code in MIPS
 Astrobytes: You got C and C++, with AVX and all sorts, it's all good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Happy fathers day to all the bot daddys!!!  You mfers... sry.&#160;;)
 LelouchVC2: Thanks dad
 Astrobytes: Thanks son
 LelouchVC2: A function with factorials and shit took me 139 characters in c++
 LelouchVC2: AFTER removing like all the spaces and formatting
 LelouchVC2: And it took this bitch 51 in Ruby:
 LelouchVC2: x=gets.to_i;puts (x-gets.to_i+1).upto(x).inject(:*)
 LelouchVC2: That was his whole code
 Andrelamus: and that is why shortest sucks
 Astrobytes: Um, yeah. Well why would you choose C++ for clash shortest?
 Astrobytes: I don't clash, but, y'know, doesn't take a genius
 LelouchVC2: I win C++ with shortest a lot. But when it comes to math equations, these other languages have shortcuts
 Astrobytes: Use the right tool for the job
 LelouchVC2: Thats why I used a hammer to get my point accross
 Astrobytes: Anyway, you can choose languages now in clashes so I see, private ones anyway
 LelouchVC2: Bash my ideas into the skulls of my enemies
 LelouchVC2: I thought I was talking to the other guy the whole time AstroBytes
 Astrobytes: So no more complaints.
 LelouchVC2: I've been bamboozled 
 struct: to bad that his ruby code is not even optimal
 struct: can even be shorter
 LelouchVC2: Ruby is gay
 LelouchVC2: any language that has "(:*)" is gay
 Astrobytes: Very mature criticism.
 LelouchVC2: Thanks, it took years to refine
 LelouchVC2: A black guy walks into a bar
 LelouchVC2: And nothing happens because @Equality
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out, got an appointment with Saul Goodman and a cheese toastie
 LelouchVC2: You've been seeing Saul alot
 Astrobytes: gn
 Snef: gn
 LelouchVC2: Should i be jealous?
 LelouchVC2: Damn, ignored
 Bangatron: hey guys, sorry to interrupt, but I'm doing the CodeBusters challenge and I notice some people get their Busters to say stuff... Any idea how to do that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: How many C++ programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
 LelouchVC2: 3, 1 to solve the problem, 1 to code it, and the other to hire someone to do it
 struct: Bangatron I think you need to output followed by the message
 struct: MOVE 213 123 message
 Bangatron: orly? I'll check that out right away, thx! n.n
 Bangatron: o wow yea that works! Thank you so much, struct!! 😊
 struct: yw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hopefully none, they just reuse it.  But in reality it takes all night to realize the class is protected
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;insert exception throw() here&gt;
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only 30 othello users
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the 5 people below me are lazy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok back to the real world
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 0 cp for 41/74 in search race, what is this world coming to
 struct: Hmm
 struct: you should get some
 struct:  after it updates
 Snef: PatrickMcGinnisII you also seems to be lazy (for Othello)

 Reksio: are c# puzzles compiled with unsafe flag? I think it supposed to be on..
 Reksio: Does anyone know anything about it it being off?
 Reksio: actually even if I don't use Unsafe code Span&lt;T&gt; is not visible to the compiler.  Aren't puzzles running on .net core 2.1+&#160;?
 struct: net 4.7 according to faq
 struct: and yes it uses -unsafe
 struct: C# 7.0 (Mono 6.4.0, .NET 4.7)Compiled with ‑unsafe
 Reksio: well, it is not. At least not for old puzzles
 Reksio: otherwise it would understand Span&lt;T&gt; I suppose
 Reksio: My specific puzzle is Chuck Norris
 Reksio: for reference
 struct: Well printing version returns 4.0.30319.42000
 struct: So I don't know&#160;:(
 Reksio: It's probably running on lambda or something of sort and they didn't change env for old ones. Probably new puzzles run on new .net.
 Mysterrion: Join guys  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12648006e11e62f8934d0b4ac83faed9e0b0656">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12648006e11e62f8934d0b4ac83faed9e0b0656</a>
 c0cainee: no
 Mysterrion: K
 Reksio: Is there a preferred list of puzzles which should be done on each difficulty before moving to higher difficulty?
 badAtCoding: c0cainee can you publish your solution?
 badAtCoding: nevermind.. thanks
 LelouchVC2: cocaine can do anything
 badAtCoding: i can see that ):
 c0cainee: I do share all my solutions when I get them right

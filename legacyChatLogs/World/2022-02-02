 ASM_MOV_INT: i had to start over, so i took a break, when i realized on the fourth test, that the number are hex...! and I was up to the 50** commands too
 One-Six: ohno......
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 One-Six: I'm trying it out too but with Lua
 One-Six: which doesn't play that nicely with binary and hex, xd
 One-Six: I probably need to write a bunch of conversion functions, I'll see
 ASM_MOV_INT: that puzzle started me on the function writing path in javascript... 
 ASM_MOV_INT: i will revisit it on another night, i'm at work, and only have an hour left
 ASM_MOV_INT:&#160;:)
 One-Six: For me, I'm trying out table of functions for Lua (table being a glorified array that can store pretty much anything)
 One-Six: Ah, I see
 ASM_MOV_INT: table of functions? sounds interesting
 One-Six: yeah, so to read and perform a opcode I can do something like op[*first char of input*](input)
 ASM_MOV_INT: I just have a getReg() and setReg() function, then just started churning through the commands one at a time... parsing commands is a very good programming exercise
 One-Six: ah... I did it the bad way (in a way) and used a global table as the register and a global var as instruction counter
 ASM_MOV_INT: well, now you got me looking at it again! rofl... oops i only passed test 1, test 2 contains the hex
 One-Six: ohno
 ASM_MOV_INT: :wink:
 One-Six: and I decided to use a lookup table for hex2bin 'cause why not, XD
 One-Six: now I just need to implement bitwise operations
 ASM_MOV_INT: lookup table? nice
 One-Six: wait, surely Lua have those...?
 One-Six: Oh I think Lua 5.2 has a binary library, but I don't know about other versions
 One-Six: I think 5.0 through 5.4 coexists and different version is used by different implementations... Lua is a pretty botchy language, but it's easy to get into for sure
 One-Six: found it, 5.3 onwards natively support several bitwise operations w/o need for libraries.
 ASM_MOV_INT: what version of lua is on here?
 One-Six: I have to assume it's the newest (5.4)
 One-Six: yep
 One-Six: at least you can get the version by print(_VERSION), xd
 ASM_MOV_INT: :grinning:
 One-Six: So no more lookup tables, hex2dec2hex it is then
 ASM_MOV_INT: oh wow, I found a bug in my bitwise OR function for opcode 40xy, fixed it... passed test 2
 One-Six: yay
 ASM_MOV_INT: this has motivated me to move forward
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 One-Six: xd
 One-Six: I ended up with another lookup table inside of the dec2hex function
 One-Six: because of ABCDEF
 One-Six: XDD
 ASM_MOV_INT: I made a getNN function
 One-Six: In my case, Lua had string.sub(str,i,j)
 One-Six: so I condensed it to s(str,d1,d2=d1)
 One-Six: so I would do s(opcode,3,4)
 One-Six: (oh yeah I decided to just store all hex as strings and just convert them to intergers when I need to mess with them)
 ASM_MOV_INT: omg i got it!
 Dorak: Simple CPU Emulation?
 ASM_MOV_INT: I thought it would take longer than that....
 One-Six: whoa
 One-Six: nice
 ASM_MOV_INT: ty &lt;bow&gt;
 ASM_MOV_INT: ooh it's a hard puzzle
 ASM_MOV_INT: hmmmm
 ASM_MOV_INT: so that one guy earlier that said he only got 50%
 Dorak: Was me. xD
 ASM_MOV_INT: if the program doesn't include the 0000 at the end, don't print
 One-Six: That would be... yeah, Dorak
 One-Six: Ohhh...
 struct: yes its lua 5.4.3
 One-Six: Thanks for verifying, struct!
 ASM_MOV_INT: at least that was my first thought after seeing his comments on chat, then reading the problem... first thing I implemented was to put that in a condition only if it was a command
 Dorak: I managed to do it a while ago. I understood my mistake, it was a base error.
 ASM_MOV_INT: ah, yes the hex
 ASM_MOV_INT: i blame the hex
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 One-Six: I'm back
 One-Six: now let's see if I know how bitwise operations work...
 <b>**Tien2k9 slaps One-Six around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: what are you workign on?
 One-Six: Simple CPU Emulation 1, what ASM and Dorak had been working on
 One-Six: huh, it didn't mention how to deal with subtraction overflow – or addition overflow clearly for that matter
 One-Six: let me pretend subtraction never overflows for now xd
 Tien2k9: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 One-Six: oh, I should pretend it uses two's compliment...?
 Tien2k9: yay i win clash 3 times a row :D
 One-Six: nice
 One-Six: I've been doing clash just for the heck of it, but I do get first and seconds so that's real nice
 One-Six: always beat by python and ruby in shortest mode though XD
 One-Six: shoot, my intricate code returns nothing XD
 One-Six: nice I did it
 One-Six: I think

 One-Six: is there a way to reopen a CoC channel I exited?
 ASM_MOV_INT: yes, but it will take you back to the puzzle, not the actual clash
 ASM_MOV_INT: ok, i had to get it...

 One-Six: Oh, I mean the chat-channel – I think it's called chat room?
 One-Six: whoa, that's a cool website
 One-Six: Nice! I aced that CPU puzzle!
 ASM_MOV_INT: not sure about the chat rooms
 ASM_MOV_INT: nice
 ASM_MOV_INT: very cool puzzle
 One-Six: It says I am should've learned about stacks with it
 One-Six: I don't think I used stacks at all? XD
 One-Six: Just chucked the entire raw opcode into a table and used a separate instruction index
 One-Six: Let's see if there's CPU Emulation 2
 One-Six: Uh, probably not tonight though (
 One-Six: noooo there isn't
 One-Six: Oh I know, I can write one! ((
 One-Six: oh, there's already some brainf**k themed puzzles
 ASM_MOV_INT: I didn't use stacks either....
 One-Six: y'all should try brainf**k, it's super fun to mess with XD
 ASM_MOV_INT: where at? link
 One-Six: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainf**k
 One-Six: Mitxela also made this super nice interpreter with visible memories:
 One-Six: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://mitxela.com/other/brainfuck">https://mitxela.com/other/brainfuck</a>
 One-Six: lemme find something I wrote a long time ago
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl, and it passed the censor test lol
 One-Six: guess it's given a special case XDD
 derjack: :upside_down:
 One-Six: Here's something I cooked up:
 One-Six: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/4c34Zir8">https://pastebin.com/4c34Zir8</a>
 One-Six: You will also need this extended ASCII character for it to work: ÿ
 One-Six: (because I used FF for EOF)
 One-Six: (I don't remember how each bit works exactly now though, but looking at the memory, you should still be able to tell what each bit does – kind of?
 One-Six: oh, mixtela also have a YT video explaining how BF works and how he made a TicTacToe "A.I." with it
 One-Six: that man is rad
 Dorak: What version of net core (or net framework) does the page use? It gives me a thousand errors a valid F# solution.
 struct: .NET Core Runtime 3.1.3	
 struct: for F#
 Dorak: Uhh... Thanks.
 Dorak: For C# is net core 3.1 too?
 struct: yes
 struct: C# 8.0 (.NET Core Runtime 3.1.3)Compiled with ‑unsafe
 Dorak: Does it take a long time for the page to update the language versions? We are currently on NET Core 6 (lts version). The new C# and F# features since .net 5+ would be really useful here. :cry:
 struct: They usually update them before contests start
 Dorak: Just out of curiosity, what contests are you talking about? Events like spring challenge 2022?
 struct: yeah
 struct: I dont know when the next one is
 Dorak: Okok. Thank you very much for your time. 
 struct: np
 Dorak: Just one more question. Is the information on the languages ​​and their versions public? I would like to see info about other languages ​​too.
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>
 Dorak: Thanks a lot. :kissing_closed_eyes:
 struct: It doesnt get update often due to backwards compatibility I think
 struct: Some languages updates can break some bots
 ashiknur: can anyone suggest to me a book on algorithms needs in codingame? l
 ashiknur: like minimax, monte charlo, etc
 struct: I dont know any sorry, but there are plenty of resources online for those 2 algos
 struct: are you mostly interested in AI?
 derjack: no books, just random articles here and there
 derjack: and/or chess programming wiki
 struct: no books for NN aswell?
 ashiknur: @struct I want to learn those algorithms actually needs for game bot. I have participated on many codingame bot competition without knowing any AI algorithms. btw I managed to get to silver in some of those. so I want to get it to a new level.
 derjack: im not a books guy. but apparently the one by sutton is good
 struct: yeap Im also not a book fan
 struct: ashiknur I would pick a simple game to play and try to implement those algos there
 struct: for example connect 4 is easy to tell whats happening, the sim is trivial
 derjack: minimax video <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU9Ch59-4vw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU9Ch59-4vw</a>
 derjack: well UTTT wood league is simple tic tac toe
 ashiknur: okay, then suggest me some resources. it would be great If I find a list of algorithms needs in game bot programming
 struct: monte carlo (random search), genetic algorithm, beam search, minimax, mcts
 struct: Those are probably the most used ones
 ashiknur: I learned minimax, genetic algorithm, neural network ( still stuck on backpropagation) know the algorithm mcts didn't find a good resource for implementing part. I am c++ programmer. I know only c++ language. 
 derjack: general: implement game simulation: list all moves, make move, undo move, check for end conditions, who won etc.understand minimax, then alpha-beta which is faster than minimax, then iterative deepening to control for timeunderstand monte carlo, random simulations, then UCB1 formula for monte carlo tree searchothers: genetic algorithm, beam search, bfs/dfs
 derjack: NN simple example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59631/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59631/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs</a>
 derjack: in python, but should be easily translatable to c++
 ashiknur: okay, I will surely work on this implementation.
 struct: bitboards are also important if you are into board games
 struct: but one thing at a time
 ashiknur: I didn't hear about that bitboards. thanks for suggesting this. I am really interested in board games.
 derjack: yeah they are generaly at least order of magnitude faster than 'normal' approaches
 struct: and easier to code in once you finally understand them

 Rebollo: Guys when I get segmentation fault, is there a way to interpret the messa errorr?

 struct: best way is to run the code on an ide
 DaNinja: node might be null when you call node.addNode() 
 CryanRyan: why would they add a world chat and not allow spamming, I'm not even on the discord
 darkhorse64: rebollo: line 237 is where the error occurs. You are trying to access an invalid memory address either because you have a null pointer or you are accessing a array out of its bounds
 struct: these errors can be tricky to figure out
 darkhorse64: definitely. If possible, use an IDE to debug because using cerr  to find problems can be difficult
 Rebollo: which one you guys suggest?
 struct: are you on windows?
 Rebollo: yes
 struct: I suggest visual studio
 struct: but it uses a different compiler that cg uses
 struct: but should be fine for most of the stuff
 struct: its a bit heavy though
 darkhorse64: ^
 Rebollo: do you guys see aanything wrong with this function/

 Rebollo: Does the pointer work only inside of it? And get lost after it is returned?
 Rebollo: Also I am intilizaling the childs pointer as nullpointer
 Rebollo: is it possible to aassign after I instatiate the object?
 struct: that code seems fine
 struct: could be reduced to 
 struct: objectsNode *createNode(objects obj) {
 struct: Yes you can assign a pointer after
 Rebollo: But once I am creating it inside the function, is is going to exist after it as well/
 darkhorse64: With the new VS 2022, you can even compile for the Linux subsystem. This way, you are making sure you are generating code similar to what runs on CG servers. I have noticed that floating point computations behave differently between msvc and gcc
 struct: yes Rebollo
 darkhorse64: Memory allocation is persistent
 Rebollo: I am loosing the hope
 struct: Rebollo how long have you been coding for?
 struct: I think I asked you this before
 struct: but cant remember
 darkhorse64: Your code is correct but you are allocating node by node while computing which is very bad for performance. Allocate a pool of nodes at startup
 Rebollo: c++ just for months
 Rebollo: but I work with SQL, data base
 Rebollo: and other laguages for 15 yearsa
 struct: These are normal errors for c++ programers
 struct: dont stress about it
 struct: its probably out of bounds error like was said before
 therealbeef: I remember you are learning, but I would advice avoiding the use of new and raw pointers
 Rebollo: I am trying to create a pointer, like and empty NODE, just to behave as a structure for the tree
 Rebollo: the problem is in the following commented row

 Rebollo: It is a vector of pointers
 Rebollo: that I am trying to use as many roots for the tree
 struct: are you sure i is within the current size of the vector?
 Rebollo: But once I am using a vector isnt it just a matter of assign any value to the index and it going to create the position?
 struct: no
 Rebollo: vector[1]
 Rebollo: vector[1]
 Rebollo: vector[1]
 struct: vector&lt;int&gt; vec;vec[0] = 5;
 struct: that code wont work
 struct: vector&lt;int&gt; vec(1);vec[0] = 5;
 struct: works
 struct: if you want to add a new element
 struct: you can just do push_back or emplace_back
 Rebollo: hum
 Rebollo: its size is 0
 DaNinja: headNode.push_back(tempLevel)
 Rebollo: can I copy from ohter vector?
 Rebollo: headNode = ballNode
 struct: if you can copy a vector into another?
 Rebollo: like just assigning
 Rebollo: vector1OfPointers = Vector2OfPoisnters
 struct: yes
 Rebollo: yes it worked now
 Rebollo: :lips:
 Rebollo: sorry guys
 Rebollo: filling a idiot 
 Rebollo: but thats ok
 Rebollo: laways learning
 Rebollo: I did that:
 Rebollo: objectsNode *tempNode = ballNodes[i];
 Rebollo: Now every change in the first pointer will reflect in the other?
 Rebollo: Like assigning childs and so on?
 Rebollo: HUm it will
 Rebollo: worked

 Blokops: Automaton2000 they taking over your job
 Automaton2000: madknight why are you guys in?

 Blokops: just edge testing
 Adam.e: edge testing?
 Adam.e: have you been to eez foods
 Adam.e: they sell deez nuts
 Adam.e:&#160;!!!!!!
 5DN1L: don't spam
 Wontonimo: no more spamming Adam.e
 Adam.e: who gon stop me
 Wontonimo: i'm giving you a 5 min time out to cool off.  
 POEJordanJ: rip lmao
 5DN1L: Do you have to be online for the bot to work, Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: ope
 Wontonimo: nope
 5DN1L: cool
 Wontonimo: just my server has to be on
 struct: :sleepy:
 Husoski: Wontonimo, consider filtering on "/clashofcode/clash/", *not* followed by "report".  It should be okay to post a result link if someone's asking a question about a clash, right?
 5DN1L: do they need to post a link to the report?
 Blokops: ^ they ca just post the code
 Husoski: Wah! Why did I come in 2nd on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2206774f26dbc3e5f642b8b90721d2449359840">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2206774f26dbc3e5f642b8b90721d2449359840</a>

 5DN1L: i don't know
 5DN1L: pass rate then time?
 5DN1L: i think you have a point there
 struct: Wontonimo from 1 to 10 how important are derivatives for NNs?
 5DN1L: but again
 5DN1L: we can answer it without the report
 Husoski: yes, of course, but it still got the direction to #clash, where it probably won't get any help
 jay3332: te
 Wontonimo: hey Husoski (and everryone) you can test the bot responses in #wontotest
 5DN1L: it's ok either way i guess
 Wontonimo: i added your suggestion 
 Wontonimo: struct, what do you mean about derivatives&#160;?
 Wontonimo: like, how important is it to understand them
 Husoski: #wontotest
 Wontonimo: or do you need them to make NNs work
 struct: how important is it to understand them
 5DN1L: Husoski true
 Wontonimo: you have to click the link Husoski or type /join wontotest
 Husoski: thx
 Wontonimo: you don't really need to understand them 
 struct: i only slept 3 hours today and reached that part of the book and didnt understand it very well
 struct: i probably will reread it tomorrow
 jacek: you only need to know that for backprop for some reason you need to multiply by derivative of activation function
 Wontonimo: but knowing that derivative is just "the slope" is good
 Wontonimo: knowing it is the slop is important
 Wontonimo: let's say you have some function f(x) = a*x + b
 Wontonimo: and you have tried a particular value of A and B and you get some error 11.2
 Wontonimo: and you pick a value really close to A, say A+0.001
 Wontonimo: and the error is 11.204
 Wontonimo: the would could say that the slope is .004 error / .001 A
 Wontonimo: or 4 error / 1 A
 Wontonimo: now that we know the direction that the error will change and by how much in relationship to A, we cold say that we want to try and get rid of all the error
 Wontonimo: we have 11.2 error ... so if we change A by - 11.2/4 = -2.8
 Wontonimo: then that is equal to a "learning rate of 1".  We use the FULL error correction
 Wontonimo: a learning rate of 0.1 would mean that we would only use -2.8*0.1 = -0.28
 Wontonimo: we would only correct A a bit, moving closer to the estimated full error correction
 Wontonimo: does that make sense or did I just confuse the issue?
 struct: Makes sense yes
 struct: I will reread it though, I feel like its important for backprop
 Wontonimo: yeah, but it's just "slope"
 struct: yeah
 Pollard_Rho_Algorithm: hello everyone
 Pollard_Rho_Algorithm: it is me, pollard_rho_algorithm
 struct: slope of the tangent right?
 Astrobytes: yes
 struct: thanks
 Astrobytes: or 'rate of change'
 struct: soon my bt will be finished and I can finally rest
 Astrobytes: as wontonimo said you can find the rate of change in whatever direction minimises the error, then you move in that direction. I think that's part of gradient descent
 Astrobytes: been a minute since I did any proper calculus
 Wontonimo: yes, that is a great description Astrobytes
 struct: yeah, im not great at calculus
 struct: Im probably just tired
 Astrobytes: yeah, get some sleep, it's not overly complex in terms of concept, just lots of symbols
 struct: brb
 Blokops: is there a way to see the game code for the contest
 Blokops: not the answer but the game itself
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: i'll dm you
 Wontonimo: oh no dbdr took down his github site!
 Wontonimo: anyone have a fork of brutal tester?
 Wontonimo: oh, nevermind.  looks like it wasn't dbdr.  it's all of github
 Blokops: it would be apocalyptic if github lost all its data
 Blokops: 2k panic levels of disaster
 mrswagger21: I lost the game :sob:
 jacek: oO
 jacek: happy groundhog day, again
 supertebibyte: is there a way to replay/finish your clashes?
 supertebibyte: i can't find the puzzle or my code once i have submitted it
 jacek: you can use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a> to search for it
 supertebibyte: thank you, i was able to find one of them. the reverse ones are harder to find
 jacek: thats the point of the reverse
 Blokops: couldn't someone just have the answer before hand using that page?
 supertebibyte: yes, it defeats the point if used maliciously. but i just want to finish my "thought" as it were, when the 10min timer is over.
 jacek: actually you have 15 minutes
 supertebibyte: either way&#160;:)
 supertebibyte: i guess i'll just hope it comes up again some time
 Jayarrowz: :grin:
 jacek: 1 2 7 3...
 Idk.-_-: hi
 Idk.-_-: guys guys
 jacek: good evening
 Jayarrowz: Reverse is a bit funny
 Jayarrowz: sometimes
 jacek: yhw
 Fasader: ynnuf tib a si esreveR
 Idk.-_-: do you think wich is the best and best look im say best proggraming language is who
 One-Six: There isn't really a "best programming language" if that's what you are asking...?
 Fasader: what are you even saying?
 One-Six: Oh, easiest to learn might be Python?
 One-Six: Lua is pretty easy to get into but can get messy if you want to do advanced stuff
 One-Six: Python seems to be well received and extremely useful almost everywhere
 jacek: easiest would to just tell the computer what you want and it will do it
 Idk.-_-: :D
 One-Six: Ah, yes, the Alexa programming language
 One-Six: "It can wake you up!"
 Idk.-_-: no it's jarvis
 jacek: it would be quite distant(?) future, but its doaeble
 One-Six: natural languages are inherently ambiguous though
 One-Six: translating that into non ambiguous code can be hard for both the translator and the dictator
 Idk.-_-: and 1 q. which language is best after python&#160;?
 One-Six: idk XD
 One-Six: want to plug Lua, but Lua starts counting at 1 so...
 Idk.-_-: mate you can't just say the simple answer&#160;?
 jacek: the question is more opinion-based i think
 jacek: and python or ruby is quite than any other language
 jacek: its a peanut butter jelly time!
 5DN1L: pascal basic julia time?
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you like peanut butter?
 Automaton2000: i guess you can add it to the right of (0, 0). expected (2, 0).
 jacek: :x

 Uljahn: Automaton2000 do you like peanut butter on pizza?
 Automaton2000: and that is the one that you can only make one move per turn?
 Wontonimo: woot!  my autobot responded to a clash post!
 Papi.Chulo: :eggplant:
 MessitheGoAt1910: :sweat_drops:
 Papi.Chulo: :peach:
 Husoski: BadBurger No.  atan2(y,x) gives the angle (yes, in radians) between the ray from (0,0) to (x,y) and the +x axis.
 Husoski: radians(th) converts degrees to radians.
 Papi.Chulo: chupa mi pene porfa

 Wontonimo: Husoski, you want any help with mad pod racing?
 Wontonimo: you are level 33!  come join the under 2000 ranking 
 HUNTERxHUNTER: :flushed:
 Husoski: Wontonimo Can I take you up on that offer later?  (But I may want some more optimization hints first, re Marslander 2)
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: you want some hints for mars 2?
 Wontonimo: have you looked at PID controllers? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 HUNTERxHUNTER: penis?
 Wontonimo: HUNTERxHUNTER you have been given a 10 min time out.  please feel free to come back but be respectful
 Husoski: Yeah, we talked about that.  What I see is a method for computing an input change based on estimate of an error term, but I don't get how to estimate an error for a trajectory when I don't know what that trajectory should be.
 Husoski: ...and I have that PDF on my desktop (but it took some fiddling to get it into a form that my ancient Acrobat would understand.)
 Wontonimo: so, imagine we are in a car going towards red light.  We don't hit the breaks when we are at the red light.  There is some distance given our speed where we should slow down
 Wontonimo: if our distance is 100m
 Wontonimo: and our speed is 10m/s
 Wontonimo: then we will blow through that red light in 10sec
 Husoski: That's fine unitl mountans get in the way.
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: let's say we can change our speed by 2m/s*s , in other words we can reduce our speed by 2m/s every second
 Husoski: yes...
 Wontonimo: so if we say, hey if we are going to blow through that light in the next 6 sec, then slow down.  else everything is fine
 Husoski: (but it's really about 0.3 m/s^2 for Marslander)
 Wontonimo: so, let's see how that plays out
 Wontonimo: 0 sec , dist = 100 , vel = 10 , eta =10
 Wontonimo: therefore no breaking (eta &gt; 6)
 Wontonimo: 1 sec , dist = 90, vel = 10 , eta = 9
 Wontonimo: 2 sec , dist = 80 , vel = 10 , eta = 8
 Wontonimo: 6 sec , dist = 60 , vel = 10 , eta = 6slow down&#160;!
 Wontonimo: 7 sec , dist = 52 , vel = 8 , eta = 6.5no breaking
 Wontonimo: 8 sec , dist = 44 , vel = 8 , eta = 5.5slow down&#160;!
 Wontonimo: and so on
 Wontonimo: you can instead target the old location minus your speed correction
 Husoski: So, how does this apply to the 2d trajectory problem?  I need to reverse speed (later test/validators) and stay above the mountains and on the map while doing that...THEN figure out how to get back to flat ground and stay above the mountains.
 Wontonimo: so, new_target = target - 6 * velocity;
 Wontonimo: if 6 is the correction factor
 Husoski: where does that come from?
 Wontonimo: that can translate directly into 2d
 Wontonimo: from above
 Husoski: 6?
 Wontonimo: the factor (6) is found by experimentation usually, but if you happen to know the physics involved precisely you can derive a good guess
 Husoski: I'm not getting a warm fuzzy feeling yet, but I'll head-scratch some more.  Thanks!
 Wontonimo: where the bot is aiming at the target location <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/575327101">https://www.codingame.com/replay/575327101</a>and here it aims for target location - velocity<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575327237">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575327237</a>
 Wontonimo: well, aims for location - 30*velocity
 Wontonimo: and otherwise it is EXACTLY the same code
 Husoski: And 30 was determined from the terrain, or is is hardcoded?
 Husoski: Does that work on, say, test case 04 (deep canyon)?
 Wontonimo: yeah, 30 was determined experimentally to work in a wide variety of situations
 Wontonimo: given that I also constrain the banking (angle) to be fairly small
 Wontonimo: the other bit of logic is what I call the "Big V"
 Husoski: Big V?
 Wontonimo: I project a large "V" from the landing pad, 45 degrees on both sides
 Wontonimo: if the mars lander is outside the "Big V" then i use a different set of logic then inside
 Wontonimo: when outside, the lander is not allowed to lose altitude
 Wontonimo: when inside it will try and land
 Husoski: That's a really useful idea.  
 Wontonimo: that's it.
 Wontonimo: i don't keep track of mountains
 Wontonimo: 45 degrees was just laziness , because that is y=x and y=-x
 Husoski: I recall trying to not lose altitude while reversing velocity and ran off the side of the map, though...
 ASM_MOV_INT: boy the syntax of programming languages that allow for such cryptic solutions....! phew
 Husoski: asm_mov_int you can do all of this in C
 Husoski: Oh, well, that gives me some stuff to try.  Thanks again!
 Wontonimo: right, if you limit angle then you also need to limit max sideways velocity
 Wontonimo: or increase the coefficient to be larger than 30
 Wontonimo: just because 30 worked for me, doesn't mean it will worrk for you.
 Wontonimo: you have to experiment with a good factor for your particular code
 ASM_MOV_INT: even assembly language is a bit more readable than most of these cryptic one liner solutions I see people churning out for clashes
 Husoski: Oh, on your Markov puzzle I named my random generator class WontoRandom in your honor...
 ASM_MOV_INT: :grinning:
 Husoski: Yep.  I was polluted by starting with a language called APL that *really* encouraged this sort of thing.
 ASM_MOV_INT: interesting
 Husoski: Here's a "complete" solution for an n-dimensional polynomial best fit in APL:
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm sure it is...!
 ASM_MOV_INT: surprised i've never run across that APL language before, sounds right up my alley...
 Husoski: You can still find it.  Dyalog sells a commercial interpreter.  If you answer a lot of questions right, you can get a free version for personal use.
 Wontonimo: lol, thanks Husoski for the honor&#160;!
 Husoski: Docs are slim and not so easy to find.  The only data structure is an array.  A bit like programming with numpy in Python.
 Husoski: If you look at the docs for Python's itertools module in the standard library, you'll see that a lot of the standard iterator patterns are inspired by APL operators.
 Husoski: Wontonimo My pleasure.  The source is published.  I only implemented the .choice() method, though, plus a .next() method in case I needed to debug something.  I don't think it will pass the poker tests, though...
 Husoski:&#160;:)
 Husoski: It's dinner time on the US west coast.  Type at you later...
 ASM_MOV_INT: hey that's where I am!
 Husoski: Correction: No rho in that APL polyfit code.  Bad memory on my part, but it's 1 character shorter:
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: that's some crazy code
 ASM_MOV_INT: sounds like a very efficient programming language

 Naknik: Where do I organize private CoCs?
 Naknik: nvm
 UglierPanda: Hey guys, im doing the chuck norris puzzle. But converting the&#160;% to ascii, i lose the first zero;s. Im using Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(); Should i do it differntly?
 Uljahn: you should use 7-bit binary, so you have to find a way to preserve leading zeros or to fill in them later
 UglierPanda: just found it, PadLeft thanks!:grimacing:
 PresidentZeus: how do I debug code with JS?
 BlaiseEbuth: Drop your code
 PresidentZeus: -_-
 PresidentZeus: like in-game, here
 xspeedasx: iirc -console.err
 jdsigg: President Zeus, can always copy-paste it into the browser dev environment&#160;:)
 sozako: hi

 FeelItDude: i got wrong ans for my c
 FeelItDude: ++ code dont know why it showing correct in my pc but wrong ans in one of the coc problem 
 Panavia_tornado: may be index error
 LittleFlea: hello world
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 LittleFlea: hey there fellow canadian
 Wontonimo: ehh
 Lekrkutj: how do i know what the binary code for the characters are in Chuck Norris
 Wontonimo: characters are stored in binary in the computer
 Wontonimo: what lang are you using Lekrkutj&#160;?
 Lekrkutj: javascript
 Wontonimo: google&#160;: get ordinal of character in javascript
 AhmedPro: helllllllllllllllllllll
 Lekrkutj: thanks Wontonimo
 Mr_PhM: hi
 Kepe55: I'm having a hard time figuring out the folding-a-note puzzle
 XcaliberD: hello
 Kepe55: Any good advice?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo tx for the easy XP
 Wontonimo: np
 Wontonimo: i forget what it was for?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: FAX machine
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: yeah, i made that a little too easy&#160;:(
 GuiPearceProgrammer: omg, there a chat here haha
 GuiPearceProgrammer: Hi guys
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Illedan: Hi
 Wontonimo: welcome to chat GuiPearceProgrammer
 Wontonimo: what's your fav programming language&#160;?
 Wontonimo: PatrickMcGinnisII I hope you at least tried to solve fax machine in something other than your primary language
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo well that's a loaded question, as far as CG is concerned I use PHP ... but that's not my primary lang.&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what is the contribute lang?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is PY your primary?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh he's gone
 Wontonimo: yeah, for now py is my primary
 Wontonimo: java used to be
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm an old man, I've seen and used all the classic langs. I use PY for plugins.  C for number crunching, Java for interactive graphics, php for web.  but I actually hate PY. *shrug*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll redo all the puzzles I've done in php in java one of these days
 JBM: we all know that date is aliased to never
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darnit, I gotta go paint.  tx again for the quickie programming fix
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol JBM, when's the next contest ... maybe i'll drop some C++.&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 jacek: huh
 martinpapa69: mcts node with multiple parents? not a problem anymore :smirk:
 AllYourTrees: :eyes:
 AllYourTrees: what did you do
 martinpapa69: i dont make a duplicate of transpositions anymore, i just link them from the node storage
 AllYourTrees: niceeee
 martinpapa69: ty
 AllYourTrees: how much did it strength things?
 martinpapa69: no idea. submit is in progress
 AllYourTrees: oware?
 martinpapa69: c4
 AllYourTrees: NICE
 martinpapa69: my last version was rank20
 AllYourTrees: GL
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: how do you backpropagate the transpositions though
 martinpapa69: on my node i dont have a list of nodes
 martinpapa69: but a list of edges
 martinpapa69: so my node dont have a children node list, but a children edge list
 martinpapa69: every edge has its own visits, q values
 martinpapa69: and the pointer to the node, which the edge leads to
 AllYourTrees: jacek do you train your NN with solver turned on?
 AllYourTrees: like when it plays games to gather data, does it have solver turned on
 jacek: of course
 martinpapa69: does you solver mess up your training&#160;?
 jacek: no
 martinpapa69: *AllYourTrees
 AllYourTrees: mine doesn't either
 AllYourTrees: do you continue a game once root is solved? or stop it
 martinpapa69: ah, ok. i thought you have problem with that. 
 jacek: stop it
 AllYourTrees: nah im always tryna gather more info on what other NN ppl are doing :eyes:
 AllYourTrees: :spy:
 jacek: hmm new play on oware. another NN?
 jacek: he appeared after that oware endgames article :thinking:
 AllYourTrees: oh J nice you're #2 impressive
 jacek: i havent submitted in long time
 AllYourTrees: even more impressive then
 Kepe55: Are you top 200 guys ever stuck? What do you do in that case?
 martinpapa69: call my stepbro
 jacek: stuck where?
 AllYourTrees: stuck in what sense? like can't program something?
 AllYourTrees: or don't have any idas
 Kepe55: when something seems so complex that you can't figure out how to do it
 Astrobytes: Learn how to do it
 jacek: split into simpler parts
 AllYourTrees: ^
 RoboStac: troll chat until someone says something useful and then steal it
 AllYourTrees: :spy:
 Astrobytes: RoboStac: :rofl:
 AllYourTrees: you've been caught RoboStac now you must reveal one secret
 AllYourTrees: :cop:
 RoboStac: are there any secrets left to reveal?&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 Kepe55: Reveal how to become Legend in algorithms :laughing:
 jacek: oO
 RoboStac: to join in the slightly earlier discussion I don't have solver in training, didn't want to consider how to handle training policy for solved states
 AllYourTrees: interesting
 Astrobytes: Seems messy.
 RoboStac: I guess it'd just be ignoring visits and setting 0 for lost and 1 for solved wins
 jacek: i dont use policy. no mess. [solved]
 AllYourTrees: yeah solved wins i think makes sense
 AllYourTrees: i think it does get messy, like when you have some solved children and some unsolved
 RoboStac: the worry I had was if there was a solved state similar to a unsolved one that made the policy values extreme
 AllYourTrees: hmm yeah didn't consider that
 martinpapa69: ye i had problems with that. my crossentropy loss went nan, because of low-visit count solved nodes. was tough to figure out where the nan came from
 AllYourTrees: had that same issue, except pytorch for some reason didn't propagate nans, so i never saw nans even though i was dividing by zero :scream:
 RoboStac: yeah, I use -1 visits for unvisited nodes and if the root ended with some unvisited children it broke the loss completely
 martinpapa69: ye, variables with multiple use always cause trouble :D
 TimothyAlexisVass: Perl, JavaScript and Python in Clash... Do I need to learn Ruby?&#160;:/
 TacticalShroom: yes
 michaellan: I don't get intuitively how NN helps with C4 policy
 michaellan: isnt C4 a game with "instant" wrong moves, the equivalent of hanging a queen in chess? or no
 TimothyAlexisVass: What's the shortest way to get 2 ints from input which are space separated?Anything shorter than this?x,y=[int(i)for i in input().split()]
 TimothyAlexisVass: ...
 HideInInspector: short cut to [PLAY ALL TESTCASES]&#160;?
 michaellan: x,y=map(int,input().split())
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you xxd
 TimothyAlexisVass: is there a shorter way to print an int x in python than str(x)&#160;?
 Klephto: print(x)?
 Feddas: Anyone done Coders Strike Back? Does BOOST amplify your current speed or does it immediately set it to some speed?
 BigFishOutOfWater: Since you only get 1 BOOST I haven't bothered to figure that out. I just use it in a situation where either way would be fine.
 Feddas: Thanks BigFish. Probably do need to focus on my turning speed more instead of when to BOOST.
 RoboStac: it gives you 650 thrust (instead of the usual 100max) for one turn
 _Royale: martinpapa69: nice I did the the transpositions like you do, at least one thing that should not be broken then&#160;:-D
 Feddas: RoboStac: thanks!
 michaellan: bob
 GuiPearceProgrammer: hi guys
 GuiPearceProgrammer: someone? I need a little help hehe
 Link_jon:&#160;?
 Link_jon: i probably cant help much as i really am only decent with lua... a scripting language.. and im not good with it... erm. eh
 Link_jon: maybe ill have an idea though
 GuiPearceProgrammer: no problem haha
 GuiPearceProgrammer: I'm new here 
 GuiPearceProgrammer: and i'm  trying undestand this plataform
 GuiPearceProgrammer: So, do you know how works the inputs?
 GuiPearceProgrammer: I need input some value in my inputs or I is it automatic?
 borrel: you should read your inputs into lua
 borrel: local line = io.read()
 borrel: the example code sould help
 GuiPearceProgrammer: ok, I thought I need insert value manually
 GuiPearceProgrammer: Thanks
 borrel: only when you want to run your script locally
 borrel: this buffer is called STDIN all programs have it
 borrel: run `lua script.lua &lt; input.txt` to run locallly
 GuiPearceProgrammer: oh right, thanks for the tip

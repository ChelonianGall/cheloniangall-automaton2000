 HiHat1937: Good morning!
 HiHat1937: Here is morning right now
 ChampionCoder: Afternoon here :sweat_smile:
 ChampionCoder: VERY hot afternoon
 ChampionCoder: :smile:
 MadKnight: where do u live that it's so hot&#160;?
 ChampionCoder: India
 ChampionCoder: Chennai
 ChampionCoder: Among the hottest areas in India
 MadKnight: come to russia
 MadKnight: cool down a bit
 kishorecoder: oh me also chennai
 Astrobytes: Good morning.
 MadKnight: hihi Astrobytes
 MadKnight: want some news from the US&#160;?
 prgrmrO_O: yeah why not
 Astrobytes: I've read the news already, thanks.
 MadKnight: texas and 7 more states sued the entire elections for being compromised
 prgrmrO_O: oh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't believe the news, its garbage
 Matr1x-101: im in uk
 MadKnight: true, just look at how they phrased that on the news<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sun9-5.userapi.com/impg/jSN9WDwAjL74912rdpiOi47o3epfhuWMZsgc2g/x5sTI7KO8AM.jpg?proxy=1&amp;sign=97f1ebf35c7fbfc88575d15c2c5f9914">https://sun9-5.userapi.com/impg/jSN9WDwAjL74912rdpiOi47o3epfhuWMZsgc2g/x5sTI7KO8AM.jpg?proxy=1&amp;sign=97f1ebf35c7fbfc88575d15c2c5f9914</a>

 MadKnight: first link broken
 Astrobytes: 7 more? I was under the impression Texas was attempting to sue 4 states.
 MadKnight: no, they want to decline the entire election results and make it so that special people do the elections instead
 MadKnight: by sueing 4 states
 Astrobytes: Well, they say Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin made 'unlawful changes' to the election procedures. It'll never work, load of crap.
 MadKnight: nonono Astrobytes 7 states joined texas at sueing 4 states
 MadKnight: so it's texas+7 more against those 4

 MadKnight: need to start turning those into short links
 Astrobytes: That'd be helpful.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the BS about the election is just a distraction for them sneaking some other sh*t by us
 MadKnight: could be true if the dems weren't so weird
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I watched the hearings, total garbage ... it's just a show
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Trump don't leave me and 10M of my friends gonna go evict his ass...rofl
 MadKnight: lol
 MadKnight: "sounds like a threat!"
 Astrobytes: Oh he'll leave. After he tries to cause as much trouble as he can between now and then.
 MadKnight: like what trouble
 Astrobytes: throwing McDonalds wrappers all over the Whitehouse carpets? I donno lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: elections are only crooked when dems win, they look the other way every other election ... trust me there is all kinds of fraud, but none substantial enough to change a damn thing
 Astrobytes: Same goes for most countries Patrick
 MadKnight: this one is pretty big
 MadKnight: 8 states are trying to do something about it
 Astrobytes: Anyway, far too much politics for this time of day, back to coding
 MadKnight: texas is soo based, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or does it have anything to do with the way i do it is to be expected
 PatrickMcGinnisII: threat, lol ... yup I own guns, got lic. to carry them, and shoot pretty damn good.  but you know that's why they outlawed guns in D.C. - cause the USA is a f'ing corporation - not a sovereign nation anymore
 MadKnight: PatrickMcPolitical
 PatrickMcGinnisII: U started it
 MadKnight: i just gave some news
 jacek: good morning
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ignore that bad news crap
 MadKnight: hey JackJohnson
 MadKnight: jacek
 Astrobytes: morning jacek
 jacek: oO
 MadKnight: u got such an imagination PatrickMcGinnisII
 MadKnight: use it to make the strongest bot in CSB
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's more like it
 Astrobytes: I thought you'd moved on from the CSB thing MK
 MadKnight: now i'm not being serious
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MadKnight: it's just for the meme
 MadKnight: anyway PatrickMcGinnisII is gonna go sleep in a bit
 MadKnight: Astrobytes what do u code&#160;?
 MadKnight: work stuff&#160;?
 Astrobytes: no I have some time off, doing raic
 MadKnight: тшсук
 MadKnight: nice
 MadKnight: how strong is it&#160;?
 MadKnight: already
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i've been rewriting There is no spoon ep2 and watching movies
 MadKnight: oh what's up with your TinS2&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: raic, nice
 MadKnight: your spoon still not working&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 62%
 Astrobytes: how strong is what MadKnight? The competition or my bot?
 MadKnight: your bot ofc
 MadKnight: Astrobots
 Astrobytes: Not very, only just submitted yesterday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Figured out how to get my cpu cycles overhead reduced, so I can apply it to most the other multis
 Astrobytes: 394th/549
 MadKnight: so how to&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's just how php references variables, data structure changes, mostly kicking in statics to replace bs var references
 TBali: I am all ears&#160;:-)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you already know, I seen some of your solutions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh, but maybe not
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if u really wanna know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I been using alot of defines
 TBali: I like to use classes, because it makes code easier to manage. But object creation is expensive.
 TBali: But at least always passed as reference
 TBali: did not really uses static variables
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for libraries, preprossed data, etc... alot of arrays, well when i generate these class trees, etc. I end up with CG not identifying bad by reference calls
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess CG doesn't recursive error check
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but anyways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can just replace all the defines with a class full of statics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: never actually do a new on it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and access and make all the changes u need to
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no bad by referrence on a constant errors
 PatrickMcGinnisII: use the class as a gamestate stack but never delete anything off of it
 TBali: I tried out oobject farming once (creating in first turn and put in an array and reuse as needed) - but it did not bring convincing result
 PatrickMcGinnisII: class astack { public static $gamestate=[]; }
 TBali: My traditional aproach is building tree of gamestate objects - but that involves lots of "clone"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then just astack::$gamestate[]=new whatever object;
 TBali: Yes I see, will try out your approach someday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pretty easy
 TBali: I always start with gc_disable();           // disable garbage collection
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so i had to put deep clones in __clone
 PatrickMcGinnisII: functions
 TBali: with simulation I don't know how to avoid deep cloning...
 TBali: I leardned I have to keep game state as few bytes as possible
 Astrobytes: make/unmake moves (but that can be problematic depending on the game)
 TBali: packing several fields in the same int with bitwose operators
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i still have to clone, but i can minimize the data by dropping it in the "global static"
 TBali: my problem with make unmake that than I need assignmnets in PHP (interpreted) - it turned out even slover then a full clone which is a language construct, so runs in C
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then all i have in a tree is the index of the gamestate and a couple status vars
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and maybe parent and child
 TBali: Thanks for the tips, gotta go back to work now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sorry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u good
 TBali: static approach sounds interesting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bitpacking can get expensive too, it's like serialize and unserialize ... you just gott figure out whats worth more... calling on the kernel or executing a bunch of instructions
 MadKnight: TEars
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes Astrobytes I've tried the do/undo stacks, works some some games, but if it's bigger than a simple array, its too expensive
 BanjoMan: Is Clash down?
 codybumba: Seems so
 BanjoMan: Or hacked?
 codybumba: noname Hacked!
 Thunderbolt: what's going on with clash
 Thunderbolt:&#160;?
 ChampionCoder: Unable to submit code in Bot Programming
 ChampionCoder: What's wrong&gt;
 ChampionCoder:&#160;?
 codybumba: I think whole CG is down!
 Thunderbolt: maybe
 ChampionCoder: But this chat is working just fine
 ChampionCoder: Right?
 JBM: no, we can't read you
 ChampionCoder: What?
 codybumba: Code submission seems not working
 ChampionCoder: Yeah
 ChampionCoder: :weary:
 DJForgottenSuperstar_f0a5: hello
 ChampionCoder: hi
 Velcoro: ok, what can I do when I get my contributions rejected (with completely nonsensical explanations) just because someone wants to revenge?
 Velcoro: reasons I got for rejection:- Solution not appropriate for shortest mode.- I don't like this. You have to better  than this.- Makes no sense Try harder next time!
 Velcoro: not sure if the link works, if it's refused<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/58584d99ff5a768c2e2415abc3abc14eefcb">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/58584d99ff5a768c2e2415abc3abc14eefcb</a>
 Rockstar555: hey guys know he was sharing links
 Rockstar555: now u don't tell like me he was spaming
 Velcoro: Rockstar555 - author of the second rejection comment
 Rockstar555: guys rule and  regulation are same for everyone
 Uljahn: the link is on point though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't like the reverse
 Rockstar555: yeah 
 Rockstar555: m link about same about code
 Rockstar555: not at all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eh, still figurable...i don't clash much
 ChampionCoder: I mainly do clash
 ChampionCoder: Among the best things here
 Rockstar555: guys
 ChampionCoder: (The best is Bot programming)
 Rockstar555: so unfair
 Rockstar555: with me
 Rockstar555: I do respect of all codingame player or member
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: are you whining, son?
 Automaton2000: illedan do you know the basics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea don't see how reverse totally works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the other seemingly random input data...nah
 Westicles: Feedback is often lame... one time I got this: the shown solution is obfuscated for no reason
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there like hundreds of CoCs, smh, so many ... i guess it is popular
 ChampionCoder: Westicles what is that supposed to MEAN?
 Westicles: haha, no idea&#160;:)
 ChampionCoder: :sweat_smile:
 Rockstar555: any body don't like me so say i will delete my id no use of codingame
 Rockstar555: :disappointed:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's all it takes :joy:
 prgrmrO_O: LOL
 prgrmrO_O: it was a nice contribution @Velcoro 
 Velcoro: thanks
 prgrmrO_O: the rejection comment is I don;t like this, c'mon
 Westicles: ooh, libel in the forum!
 ChampionCoder: what?
 Rockstar555: baned myself
 Rockstar555: i think this is good for me 
 Velcoro: Westicles, ChampionCoder, Rockstar555, yes, I posted it on the forum. Do you have any other ideas that I could do to defend against your trolling?
 WelloHorld: Hello How are you all
 WelloHorld: :money_mouth:
 Westicles: Anyone who doesn't like your contribution is a troll?
 WelloHorld: Yes for sure
 Rockstar555: Velcoro
 WelloHorld: fo
 WelloHorld: FO*
 Westicles: And I thought I was bad at taking criticism&#160;:)
 Rockstar555: Rockstar555 05:28PMNow guys listen to me i am leaving coding i don't do code in my life
 mzbear: Well... Three people rejected Velcoro's submission, and they're all following each others, so it is somewhat plausible that it could be a voting ring from a group of friends coordinating on a 3rd party platform
 mzbear: So, I can see why Velcoro would jump to such conclusion
 Rockstar555: hey stop it
 mzbear: That said, I very much dislike drama, surely there's a better way to handle this than arguing about it in the chat
 ChampionCoder: Really, is this soooo serious?
 ChampionCoder: Answer that first
 mzbear: If you three know each others and conspired to get 3 rejections for someone's submission, then yes, it is very much serious and I'd be surprised if that wasn't a bannable offense
 prgrmrO_O: we should respect others contribution, and if it is bad they can try to say to improve, without any clear explanation of rejection  it is bad I think
 ChampionCoder: I DON'T KNOW THEM!!!
 Rockstar555: prgrmrO_O 
 Rockstar555: Nice
 ChampionCoder: If i see someone good at programming, I'll follow them
 Rockstar555: but respect this contribution 
 ChampionCoder: Don't create hypotheses on that point
 ChampionCoder: ok?
 kishorecoder: Hello Champion Coder
 WelloHorld: Can you people please stop talking? You people are fkin annoying
 Rockstar555:  I don't like this. You have to better  than this.
 Rockstar555: i say that u have to better than this
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm sorry what WelloHorld&#160;?
 Rockstar555: hey abusing in world chat
 Rockstar555: baned it
 Uljahn: you could've just downvoted and left a comment, rejection should be well justified
 Rockstar555: WelloHorld
 prgrmrO_O: absolulty
 Haxr69: An error for my Coders Strike Back bot is that it didn't "provide 1 input lines in due time". Is that likely due to an error or is the allowed computation time smaller than my algorithm needs (which is quite tiny tbh)?
 kishorecoder: hm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Haxr69 primary issue is usally an infiinite loop
 kishorecoder: prgrmrO_O what happened to your account
 Rockstar555: yeah
 Rockstar555: he was still changing his account
 kishorecoder: I have 5 more followers as Pro_Ogrmr
 mzbear: Haxr69, if your bot is written in C++, I've seen that timeout message happen upon hard crashes as well, with nothing indicating that the program actually segfaulted
 Uljahn: Haxr69: make sure your inputs are updated, there could be a change in inputs when you get promoted
 kishorecoder: c++ integer input is confusing
 kishorecoder: we have to use cin.ignore()&#160;:/
 ChampionCoder: what you can do is make sure there is no and or "or' conditions in loop or if statement
 Rockstar555: guys happy ending 
 Rockstar555: of mylife in codingame
 Rockstar555: tommorow shut down
 Uljahn: not the right place to seek for attention, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why is it so hard to find
 mzbear: Rockstar555, I believe this is already 3rd or 4th time you've said that. Do it or don't do, but stop crying for attention and pity.
 Trebor_303: yeee incels
 mzbear: Ugh. I should've never opened this chat today. I started writing a bot for Blocking and it was too tedious so I thought I'd check the chat instead; big mistake :D
 ChampionCoder: :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: what on earth is going on in here today?
 prgrmrO_O: :D
 ChampionCoder: impeachment trial
 ChampionCoder: :smile:
 Rockstar555: Wait guys I change my mind my mother told me not solution for this plz to practice to so all u are also better:smile:
 Astrobytes: Rockstar555: just give it a rest will you, please.
 Rockstar555: okk
 Rockstar555: Sorry
 Rockstar555: Only do important topic in world chat
 Rockstar555: now fine
 mzbear: Blocking has to be the most annoying bot game I've started so far. I've already spent a few hours and I haven't even gotten started writing any actual decisionmaking code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh there is a new league in blocking
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mzbear want me to tell you best/fastest way to get on board?
 mzbear: at least there's plenty of redundant input given, so i can progressively bootstrap the bot code, but this is still quite tedious to get started with
 mzbear: Well, I kinda did rand()%validMoves just to test things out, but anything beyond that is horrible
 mzbear: it's fairly pointless to write evaluation functions using only the x/y coordinates of the referee-provided valid moves, so there's a lot of work I have to do to deal with board management etc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: making library of bitmap like tiles and pattern fitting to board is fastest imho, you can xor like an old school bitblt
 WelloHorld: :eyes:
 mzbear: ohwell, submitted a naive weighted random AI just to get myself onto the leaderboard to encourage others to join too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tryinmg to remember  boardseg xor tile xor not boardseg ==0 is a good move... i think that's how it goes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eh, i'm sleep deprived
 mzbear: I'm a bit concerned about the board size being input, though. To hardcode against N=13 size or to make generic code in case future leagues vary the board size?&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: make it bigger like +8 so 21x21... easier to bitblt without a bunch of is x and y valid stuff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i have no idea if board size is gonna change
 nsrsn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5588845f-8f17-4f6c-a908-5230171a4f02">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5588845f-8f17-4f6c-a908-5230171a4f02</a>
 mzbear: nsrsn: programming puzzles can be very different from real life programming.  just keep doing them and remember to view other people's solutions once you have finished a puzzle to see how others solved it, there are sometimes really good stuff to be found there.  some puzzles are more tedious than others, pick your battles
 mzbear: and make sure to take a look in the medium and hard puzzles too, some of them might be easier for you than many of the easy puzzles.
 VizGhar: nsrsn which problems are you exactly referring to? There are differences when solving algorithms/CoC/AI... but most of the time it is about finding best possible data structure and apply best possible transformations/search algorithms.
 VizGhar: have a look at other programmers solutions after you solve some puzzle, or read post mortems on AI challenges, or just read this chat... you will hear of some algorithms here (my first algos reading this chat were MCTS and Beam Search)
 VizGhar: Or just be infinitelly curious
 mzbear: programming is basically just the art of applying transformations to your inputs, and problem solving is about figuring which sequence of transformations help you turn your inputs into the desired outputs
 mzbear: thus, to become better at problem solving is two-fold: learn new ways to manipulate your data, and learn how to combine the tricks at your disposal to get from A to B.  figuring out the algorithms to use is itself a pathfinding problem, i suppose&#160;:)
 mzbear: divide and conquer: turn large problems into a pile of small problems, and small problems into pile of trivialities
 VizGhar: But these are some high level advices&#160;:) give us an example which problem exactly do you need to solve? we wont give you solution, just hints
 ParticleBeam: When exactly can you consider a bot puzzle like Blocking to be "solved"?
 Astrobytes: When you reach the next league iirc
 YodaMaster123: A game is solved when all outcomes are computed right?
 Astrobytes: Oh did you mean theoretically?
 ParticleBeam: Well, I just meant in terms of CG puzzles
 ParticleBeam: Not theoretically
 mzbear: from game theory point of view, the game is "solved" when you know for certain who's going to win even without playing&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: then yes, next league
 Astrobytes: *top league
 Haxr69: Apparently, my code doesn't read all available input before giving an output. Given the fact that in my code, the ouput is distinctly after the input, does that mean that my code takes so long to compute that by the time it gives an output, it's already time to get the next input?
 mzbear: Haxr69, that message also sometimes happens when the program crashes&#160;:)
 Haxr69: I see :D
 mzbear: add some good old fashioned debug output to stderr and see that it doesn't stop at some unexpected position
 Haxr69: It's pretty funny my pod is just racing all over the screen, spastically changing direction while the other pod is calmly completing the race xD
 Matr1x-101: lol
 mzbear: i've even resorted to tracking loop counters and outputting a line every 1000 rounds etc, to find out the exact loop round it crashes... and then i'll just do if (i==12765) std::cerr &lt;&lt; "foo" .... etc inside the loop to find the exact spot ;D
 wlesavo: Haxr69 also this can happen if you print your actions twice, like having another endl; or smth
 philRG: it is also good to test your code locally at the last, but message generally occurs when you don't read all input, have a print on stdout, or when programs does not respond after an amount of time due to different reasons (crashs, timeout, etc...)
 philRG: for debugging, local ide is the best
 Haxr69: I think in my case the issue was that I had two outputs sometimes because I had two "if" statements that weren't exclusive. 
 Haxr69: Now I have to solve the more amusing problem of how to prevent my pod from getting into a perfect orbit around a checkpoint lol
 Uljahn: should be ez with taking the velocity vector into account
 LastRick: ^ if you're going in a circle, think about what your thrust should be
 nsrsn: late reply: thanks for your replies guys.
 Leirn: Hi guys. On The Polish Dictionary, I pass all the tests, but still failed one the validator 7, I have no clue why...
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the footer got a redesign
 Uljahn: FAQ is quite well-hidden
 AntiSquid: smaller footer that's locked in place (fixed position) would be better
 AntiSquid: just a personal opinion
 eulerscheZahl: Uljahn that was my first thought: where is FAQ?then I found it

 eulerscheZahl: antisquid wasn't that a bit harsh again?
 elderlybeginner: what is your data structure for map grid in python?
 elderlybeginner: I usually fight between dictionary, numpy 2d matrix, complex numbers, string for whole line or simple grid[x][y] and even linear list.
 LastRick: Q about MeanMax for the forum: In Wood 1 when you're able to SKILL with the destroyer, would there be a reason an output like "SKILL 4387 -4336 DESTROYER" is not working if I have enough rage (currently 120). 
 eulerscheZahl: is that point in skill range?
 LastRick: maybe not, great catch
 Uljahn: elderlybeginner: i always go for numpy, but just because im trying to learn it better
 Alurian: hello&#160;:)

 Astrobytes: that's a kick hatjjjjj
 LastRick: You can say that again
 Astrobytes: "that's a kick hatjjjjj" :P
 Astrobytes: how you getting on in CSB gold LastRick?
 LastRick: My best submission was inside the top 50. Fiddled with it for another day or so but couldn't break through. I'm beginning to fear I've done all I can, that I can only get into legend if I simulate or use GA on the turns.
 LastRick: Taking a break for a few days to de-stress, playing mean max right now
 Astrobytes: No, it's definitely possible using just mathematics + physics. Sim &amp; search is probably easier though
 Astrobytes: Oh nice :D
 Astrobytes: I'm sure that will massively reduce your stress level lol
 LastRick: Yeah /s
 Astrobytes: Cool game though, I really should get around to it properly
 Astrobytes: Just lazy to write the sim. Same for PCR
 LastRick: PCR?
 JBM: lazyness ftw
 LastRick: hah
 Astrobytes: Ah sorry, Poker Chip Race
 Astrobytes: you know it JBM
 JBM: i do
 Astrobytes: how's it going?
 JBM: so so
 JBM: not much news
 Astrobytes: yeah, about the same here
 Astrobytes: btw, forgive me if I repeat myself, but your contest report was a fun read
 Wajdi.B: anyone hiring an embedded systems engineer with good knowledge in autosar? 
 Astrobytes: him -&gt;
 JBM: i don't recall reading you say it yet
 JBM: glad you liked it
 Astrobytes: Probably not the best place to ask for work Wajdi.B
 Astrobytes: Missed the streams (I know it was French but the code is the code right)
 Wajdi.B: thought I'd try my luck hahah @astrobytes
 JBM: well they're youtubed
 JBM: there was only one, no?
 LastRick: Astro/JBM: Is the postmortem writeup the one linked to in the forum?
 JBM: i forget
 JBM: LastRick: yes
 Astrobytes: there is a jobs section on the discord Wajdi.B but... well, yeah
 Astrobytes: I also forget JBM. I pretty much forgot the contest by now as well if I'm totally honest :D
 LastRick: thanks, i'll check it out. This was my first contest (i've never coded any AI/bots/etc) so I'm curious to read others reactions.
 JBM: there's a full thread of them LastRick ^^
 JBM: Astrobytes: i haven't forgotten the contest yet
 JBM: being the first in a *long* time helps
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there were quite a few more than usual this time around
 Astrobytes: Yes, nice to see you enthused tbh
 JBM: heh :D
 JBM: conjunctions
 Astrobytes: the key to your heart huh?
 JBM: something like that
 Astrobytes: I had a mind to go back to one of the board games on here after the contest but ended up doing raic
 LastRick: JBM: Interesting. I thought the timeouts were just me.
 JBM: far from
 Astrobytes: It was a known issue during the contest
 LastRick: it was my first contest so i didnt know this wasnt normal
 Astrobytes: (and before if I'm honest)
 JBM: took me a long time to open my eyes though
 JBM: we CG'd language users tend to take it language-personally
 JBM: CG? no, GC
 LastRick: I too probably lean AGAINST wood leagues (restricting rules). It felt like every time I got promoted, I had to rewrite my code from scratch, new classes, etc.
 Astrobytes: CG, GC... I always associate one with the other
 jacek: wood contest?
 Astrobytes: Yeah I find it rather annoying too
 Astrobytes: ffs jacek 
 jacek: hello to you to
 LastRick: heh
 Astrobytes: Good evening jacek
 struct: Hello I have a c++ question shouldn't this
 struct: void Agent::simulate(State&amp; copy, int8(&amp;check)[HEIGHT * WIDTH][2], int8&amp; checkCounter, int8(&amp;cells)[32][2], int8(&amp;visited)[WIDTH][HEIGHT])
 struct: be passing by reference?
 jacek: ohh never saw the int (&amp;x)[3] as argument
 jacek: but yeah, they should be passed as reference
 Astrobytes: it's a way of passing raw arrays as references jacek
 jacek: so change one inside the function and it will be changed outside
 Astrobytes: perhaps it's the 2d part?
 struct: Ok, so I got it right
 struct: Now I cant understand why calling that function is costing so much
 struct: I moved the code to a function so I dont have repeated code
 struct: But now it slowed by 50%
 Astrobytes: do you have to calculate height * width on the fly?
 struct: compiler should handle it right?
 Astrobytes: possibly, I like to be sure
 Astrobytes: I don't think that's the issue though
 struct: Ok makes sense it was 50%
 struct: I had a bug where i increased sims two times..
 Astrobytes: I believe the appropriate response is: "lel"
 Astrobytes: don't worry, I've had many of those moments in the past 24 hours
 jacek: aww
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MadKnight: wow that looks like a ton of weird code
 MadKnight: why would anyone need to pass such things somewhere&#160;?
 MadKnight: in such a way&#160;?
 MadKnight: what is struct even doing&#160;?
 struct: stc
 jacek: not using structs obiously
 Astrobytes: passing raw arrays by reference
 MadKnight: no i mean what for&#160;?
 Astrobytes: he just said, stc
 MadKnight: stc has visited&#160;?
 struct: floodfill has
 MadKnight: just use my fancy BFS implementation
 Astrobytes: you're passing all that to a floodfill?
 MadKnight: fast and readable
 struct: no
 struct: for floodfill i pass this
 struct: int8 Agent::floodFill(State&amp; state, int8 _x, int8 _y, int8&amp; min_x, int8&amp; max_x, int8 (&amp;cells)[32][2], int8 (&amp;visited)[WIDTH][HEIGHT])
 MadKnight: lol just make a struct for all of these
 AntiSquid: still huge line in param
 MadKnight: Agent::floodFill(ffData&amp; data)
 Astrobytes: it is a tad unwieldy tbh
 MadKnight: why do u need to pass visited&#160;?
 MadKnight: why not generate new?
 MadKnight: and what are these min/max x&#160;?
 MadKnight: u still could just use my BFS which supports all of that and doesn't look weird
 struct: minX maxX is for piecesFall
 AntiSquid: how about a function call as parameter, the function then returns a bunch of paramters!?
 MadKnight: why "!?"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: because it's a question with a lot of enthusiasm
 MadKnight: we can't tell if that's better, struct isn't giving a lot of info about what exactly he's trying to do
 MadKnight: with this
 MadKnight: he's like
 MadKnight: "i'm trying to do this weird way for something"
 MadKnight: wow so YT just stated
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9d060a5-8f19-4897-b569-310a01fcc343">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9d060a5-8f19-4897-b569-310a01fcc343</a>
 AntiSquid: w/e ... i just hope at some point article 230 gets reworked and social media doesn't take sides / goes political on its users . really hate the censorship ...
 LastRick: ^
 AntiSquid: but don't expect anyone to do something for the people at this point, everyone just covering their own ass and doing their lobbying and business dealz
 AntiSquid: MadKnight <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmKtn_HvpfbTu3QV4lhJIMw/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmKtn_HvpfbTu3QV4lhJIMw/videos</a> scroll down a bit, zuck and dorsey were under fire for how they handle their platforms
 Astrobytes: hey AntiSquid, ever check out Lex Fridman on youtube?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: why? is there a particular video / topic you want to mention&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i even joined his discord, but was getting pinged for random stuff like "poetry hour" ... even Automaton2000 is more reasonable
 Automaton2000: i really want to submit my code and it works fine
 Astrobytes: Totally unrelated to previous chat, just seemed like a channel you'd check out. Just watched (well, listened mostly) to his Leonard Susskind and Jim Gates
 Astrobytes: interviews
 AntiSquid: a lot of the stuff he says end up being repetitive at some point btw, he follows specific format, you'll notice after 10 - 20 videos :P
 AntiSquid: guests can be interesting to listen to but it often gets philosophical and it's somewhat watered down for the audience
 Astrobytes: Yeah I already noticed, but still responses vary. He's framing topics in a ML/AI context which is cool. But yes, rather dumbed down
 Astrobytes: I don't mind the philosophical parts tbh
 AntiSquid: when GPT-3 just became popular he started asking about it every god-damn video, i mean it's an awesome tool, but you don't learn much about it from his videos, you would need to search gpt-3 specific videos to see all the cool stuff it can do (this is what i mean by watered down)
 Astrobytes: Yeah I get you. Tbh I was more interested in his videos with theoretical physicists :D
 AntiSquid: also you had to apply for the tool and were put in a queue and chances were high you wouldn't get access unless you work in a lab and do some super interesting projects&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: for gpt-3
 Astrobytes: I didn't start listening for educational purposes, just interesting conversation
 Astrobytes: For example, I'm not gonna listen to his Joe Rogan interview.
 AntiSquid: Elon Musk was in some of his vids, that's how i found his channel
 Mastermori: how do I repeat the first part of coders strike back??
 BenPix: what's a bruh number&#160;?
 AntiSquid: you can't reset to wood Mastermori if that's what you mean
 Astrobytes: Otherwise just type "Coders" :P
 Astrobytes: I have no idea BenPix
 Mastermori: I apparently played it over 2 years ago and have no idea whats going on now, can I reset the hitns and the state of the instructions (its telling me that I "now have access to boost" which implies there were easier instructions before these)
 BenPix: no idea for the meaning of this question "A bruh number of n is square of sum digits of n"
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m3hGZvD-0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m3hGZvD-0s</a> interesting how his way of life religious (strict habits) without involving any religion :P
 BenPix: example: 4 is the bruh number of 11
 Mastermori: it means for 6241 its (6+2+4+1)^2 @BenPix
 BenPix: ooooh I see, thanks bud&#160;:)
 Mastermori: no problem ^^
 jacek: so clash
 jacek: y
 AntiSquid: you can only go through the old leagues from a new account or by deleting your account and re-registering it&#160;:/ Mastermori
 Astrobytes: yeah, I don't get into any of that crap AntiSquid, life is too volatile.
 Mastermori: Oh, ok ty Antisquid
 Astrobytes: Annoying as it is&#160;:/
 Mastermori: WIll just create a new account then, dont have much here anyways
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: i think i like joe rogan more than lex fridman
 Astrobytes: lol, on a personal level perhaps yeah haha
 Astrobytes: Can't see Lex doing DMT
 Astrobytes: If Joe would perhaps smoke less of the ganja he might get his head together a bit more
 Astrobytes: anyway, out for tonight. Off to cross my fingers my raic bot climbs overnight before I bring it down again with my rewrite tomorrow
 Astrobytes: gn all
 jacek: mods are asleep, start trolling
 Astrobytes: i'm not gone just yet 
 Astrobytes: shocking behaviour jacek :P
 jacek: AutomatonNN is that true
 AutomatonNN: why is life a contest?
 jacek: indeed
 Astrobytes: very profound. Good night
 AntiSquid: and Isaac Arthur is my favorite for listening to philosophical stuff, but havn't tuned in for a while 
 AntiSquid: i thought proper trolling happens right in front of mods and goes unnoticed jacek
 reCurse: I'm pretty sure at least 50% of my time in pytorch is spent making tensor match in size and dimensions
 reCurse: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: what are you working on&#160;?
 reCurse: ML for work project
 Westicles: Kind of scary, people mess up a tensor and cars drive off bridges
 reCurse: Gladly working on less life-critical stuff
 reCurse: Still though I must be missing something
 reCurse: Or maybe I just suck at remembering shapes
 reCurse: But there has to be a smarter way
 mzbear: WTF, some people solve every puzzle in every language, like 300+ puzzles solved in 20+ languages. Is there some tool to generate solutions in every language at the same time or what's going on?
 reCurse: A lot of languages have very straightforward translations
 Westicles: I wouldn't know
 mzbear: Westicles, how did you do it? Every language with 387 puzzles solved, except c++ with 388 puzzles solved
 Westicles: Well, the supernintendo challenge is c++ only...
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5800a36c655f42f53885c128d09eaed15f7f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5800a36c655f42f53885c128d09eaed15f7f</a>
 DomiKo: mzbear that could help
 Westicles: Oh, so now it is helpful :P
 mzbear: I see, he only needs to write solution in one language and then write an execution wrapper in every other language ... *sigh*
 DomiKo: "only"
 reCurse: That's not what this contribution is about though?
 Westicles: No, different problem entirely
 Westicles: More of a golfing application
 Westicles: Funny everybody says "how do you do that", looks at the solution, declares it trivial, and gets all haughty
 DomiKo: 100% agree
 mzbear: Yes, I didn't expect cheating to be an option
 Westicles: And there you go...
 mzbear: it's indeed trivial if you change the rules and don't actually write the solution in the given language
 DomiKo: cheating?
 Westicles: mzbear, you are ignorant of the rules
 mzbear: There only seems to be rules for contests, the puzzles don't seem to have rules at all
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/rules-of-the-code-golf-and-optimization-challenges/187258/5">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/rules-of-the-code-golf-and-optimization-challenges/187258/5</a>
 mzbear: A pascal code that executes a c++ compiler and runs the resulting binary is not a solution written in pascal. Makes those statistics completely useless
 mzbear: It would be nice if the profile directly allowed displaying the player's published solutions to puzzles (if the viewer has solved them as well)
 reCurse: Blame the game not the player
 Westicles: Well, they could fix it pretty easily.  Move perl to /usr/share/zzz....zzz/perl
 mzbear: I'm just disappointed. Also, that link about code golfing rules shocked me a bit, as I had never thought of the "output random answer, submit until it passes" approach. If that is a legit strategy, code golfing leaderboards are worth nothing
 Westicles: Oh yeah, those guys brag about submitting 500 times with random answers.  You have to turn off your personal sense of Justice and just enjoy that the problem has sneaky approaches
 Westicles: Of course, that could be fixed with many validators.
 Westicles: I don't think most people care much about it.  Like the least important thing in the universe to change it
 mzbear: I had taken a brief attempt at code golf puzzles before and thought I just sucked at it because my solutions got nowhere close to winning ones and I couldn't think of any further tricks to employ
 mzbear: I used the leaderboard as a goal to see how much room I have to improve
 mzbear: Seems to have been a foolish thing to do.
 mzbear: I was expecting the leaderboard scores to represent the algorithmic complexity of the problem, or at least the kolmogorov complexity of the validation set
 mzbear: I must admit I'm currently upset
 LastRick: hahahah
 struct: The multies with the most players give the easier points
 therealbeef: and contests
 mzbear: Waitamoment. Since solutions can run arbitrary binaries, is it possible for bot challenges to execute the opponent's bot to play in its stead?
 mzbear: Does the referee run as same user as the bot? Now that the fall contest is over and the rules no longer apply, would it be OK for bot to snoop the referee's memory to look up the upcoming recipes and spells to eliminate randomness?
 Westicles: You mess around with contests or bot problems, you get banned
 mzbear: contests yes, but where are the rules for bot competitions? I'm not seeing any rules anywhere
 struct: I doubt you can execute opponent code
 struct: They run under different users, but on the same machine
 mzbear: oh, so they've considered that already
 reCurse: Something that obvious would have been abused years ago
 GD_JackAttack: no
 GD_JackAttack: I wont
 GD_JackAttack: you know what
 GD_JackAttack: i will
 LastRick: Must be that time of night
 GD_JackAttack: yes
 Wisart: I completed power of thor but didn't get any coding points, how does this work?

 Majeck: Wisart, you get XP for solving single-player puzzles and CodinPoints for beating other players in the "Compete" tab
 Majeck: XP = LevelsCodinPoints = Rank
 GD_JackAttack: c=var
 GD_JackAttack: vore
 Majeck: You could beat all the Very Hard puzzles, be level 50 but if you didn't participate in any multis you would have a rank of 2000000 or something
 Wisart: sry again, so if I click on Compete in the top ther is a section code golf, there I have power of thor which I completed and gained XP
 Majeck: Ohhh
 Wisart: So thor is only xp but no coding points?
 Majeck: You have to wait a day hahaha
 Majeck: Yeah Code Golf gives you CodinPoints
 Wisart: ah damn, thx
 Wisart: kk i'm just too impatient :D
 Majeck: But your rank updates once a day
 Wisart: well I already got my thor rank, that updated pretty quickly
 GD_JackAttack: nigger

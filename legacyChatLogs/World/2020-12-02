 Rockstar555: hii
 Uljahn: :rolling_eyes:
 Rockstar555: hey tell me about multplayer game
 Uljahn: which one?
 daffie: it's not letting me into clash
 daffie: it counts down then it just does nothing.. when i click launch clash I get error code 504, clash already started
 daffie: maybe third time is the charm
 Uljahn: works fine for me
 Rockstar555: how to work in multplayer game
 SkyleDc: Is there a IDE debugger&#160;? like with stop dots and all
 Uljahn: don't think so, but you can print to error stream
 Uljahn: or debug locally
 SkyleDc: Yes but that's not what i want
 SkyleDc: Do you mean like, making the same code on a real ide&#160;?
 SkyleDc: and using the ide's debugger&#160;?
 AshKetchum: you can debug locally and use cgsync on chrome or cglocal on firefox
 SkyleDc: what is cgsync please&#160;?
 AshKetchum: it syncs a local file with ide
 AshKetchum: wait, i will post a link to the forum
 SkyleDc: where can i get it&#160;?
 AshKetchum: wait, i will post a link to the forum
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614/34">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614/34</a>
 Uljahn: this one?
 AshKetchum: yes
 AshKetchum: Also SkyleDc, if you are on Firefox, you can use CG Local because CGsync is chrome only

 SkyleDc: I'm on chrome
 SkyleDc: I downloaded it, thanks
 AshKetchum:&#160;:)
 SkyleDc: Does someone have a "code a la mode" (idk if that's the same name in english and all) starter code for C++&#160;?
 Uljahn: there was no starter for cpp i guess
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/csj/code-a-la-mode/tree/master/src/test/starterkit">https://github.com/csj/code-a-la-mode/tree/master/src/test/starterkit</a>
 AntiSquid: there were starters for java, ocaml and visual basic lol 
 AntiSquid: i would share a starter code for c++, but i can't access my early bot versions from that contest SkyleDc
 ganaa1337: hello 
 sssuuri: hello
 PrO_Ogrmr: hey when i tried a new language typescript and used javascript it worked :D
 Stonk: some clash of code questions have so much extra info so the hard part is reading the question
 LastRick: Yeah, instructions for creating a new puzzle should probably reflect this. IN/OUT descriptions can be as long as you want, you have all day. Clash descriptions should be kept to the bare minimum. (I'm guilty of this myself.)

 struct: you did not cover your factory

 Slaih: can anyone help me?
 jacek: huh
 davygallegos: Is everyone on code4life board?  So confused as a beginner dev
 ZarthaxX: wdym?
 davygallegos: so the first command is console.log("GOTO id").  Are all commands going to be console.log?  
 davygallegos: or may i make my own variables and functions outside of console.log?  
 ZarthaxX: im confused
 ZarthaxX: you can change the code all you want
 ZarthaxX: as long as you follow the communication protocol with the input and output
 ZarthaxX: and this protocol thingy depends on the game you are playing
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/arVQw15_460swp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/arVQw15_460swp.webp</a>
 davygallegos: You mean the "initialization input"&#160;?  
 ZarthaxX: LOL jacek
 ZarthaxX: davygallegos yes and the round input
 davygallegos: Thanks ZarthaxX (bw your username is very familiar)
 ZarthaxX: np, and i dont know why haha
 ZarthaxX: i came up with it
 jaaabir: hmm
 jaaabir: someone here join the clash of code 
 davygallegos: I'll keep at it.  Still get nervous making own code
 Astrobytes: No.
 Astrobytes: @jaaabir
 Astrobytes: hey Zartho
 Astrobytes: hey trollcek
 Astrobytes: hey all
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8hYrNsRoTs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8hYrNsRoTs</a> this is quite good AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the main idea?
 AntiSquid: the song AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is the best place to learn c++ in general :P
 jacek: really? hmm
 eulerscheZahl: stop calling that moron bot
 ZarthaxX: davygallegos why
 jacek: will you teach me c++?
 ZarthaxX: hi astro
 Astrobytes: tf is that RAIC code
 eulerscheZahl: Rust
 Astrobytes: No, I mean the C++
 eyev: hi kyle
 eulerscheZahl: well, that one is C++ obviously
 <b>**eulerscheZahl doesn't really like the C# starter</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: using structs over classes so I can't just modify in place
 Astrobytes: I don't like the C++ either
 eulerscheZahl: and the properties array. I admit it's less data but would be more convenient to have a reference to the properties in each object
 AntiSquid: do you have fun in RAIC halite&#160;?
 AntiSquid: not judging, just asking
 eulerscheZahl: i like it
 Astrobytes: really odd coding on their part tbh
 Astrobytes: Still, I can make it do things
 eulerscheZahl: and we even get about 4 matches per hour
 AntiSquid: :O
 Zenoscave: How do you solve swinging player eval heuristic in minimax
 Zenoscave: like with iterative deepening one depth is vastly different and swings back and forth
 eulerscheZahl: i increase the depth by 2
 jacek: use different eval for whos turn now? tempo bonus or something
 Zenoscave: tempo bonus?
 eulerscheZahl: temporary
 Zenoscave: ah
 Zenoscave: I'll try those
 Zenoscave: like bonus = 100 * (depth&#160;% 2)
 Zenoscave: or something like that?
 eulerscheZahl: or do the lazy toady way and only test even numbers of search depths :P
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: I'll try both and see which works better
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Tempo#Tempo_Bonus">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Tempo#Tempo_Bonus</a>
 Zenoscave: thanks
 jacek: i dont know where euler got temporary from
 Zenoscave: me either
 eulerscheZahl: i'm creative
 ZarthaxX: toadtive
 Astrobytes: creatoad
 ZarthaxX: ah better
 ZarthaxX: i cant make names anymore
 ZarthaxX: :c
 ArianPunk: euler, you're still here. I came back after 7 months of hiatus.
 PrO_Ogrmr: hey i am struggling with temperature puzzle i can't find where my code fails, i tried lot of versions and  top score is 80%
 ZarthaxX: did you consider no temperatures case?
 PrO_Ogrmr: yeah
 ParticleBeam: Check that you are returning the positive temperature if it is the same distance as the negative temperature
 ZarthaxX: and that
 PrO_Ogrmr: ok
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of users are still here ArianPunk
 ZarthaxX: not cyberpunk
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: he used to appear once in a while on ru
 ZarthaxX: did he appear recently??
 Astrobytes: not that I know of
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: sad times
 ZarthaxX: 2020 took everything from us
 eulerscheZahl: we still have struct
 ParticleBeam: Including another year
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ar.pinterest.com/pin/775252523350518933/">https://ar.pinterest.com/pin/775252523350518933/</a>
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: you are a :turtle:
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl true
 ZarthaxX: that's all that matters
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Astrobytes: Zeno la tortue
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 jacek: only month to end of 2020
 jacek: then real life happens
 ArianPunk: yeah, i went on a long journey. 
 ArianPunk: journey of doing diff. things
 ZarthaxX: jacek prob december comes with a big asteroid killing us all or smth
 jacek: finally
 Astrobytes: hopefully yeah
 ParticleBeam: Hmm. It's December. No asteroid
 ZarthaxX: december just started ParticleBeam, just wait a bit when we get close to new year&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: 'cause asteroids like to end the year with a bang
 ZarthaxX: astro knows&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hey, maybe we get Asteroid Jesus/&lt;insert your saviour here&gt; or something
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: pasusu will save us
 eulerscheZahl: seems it's spelled Pazuzu
 Astrobytes: I was gonna correct you but you even beat me to that (I was afk for a minute)
 jacek: slowbytes
 Astrobytes: astroslow
 Sergen: when only one guy gets the answer but does not share code FeelsBadMan
 Astrobytes: #mustdobetter
 ParticleBeam: I thought you could only see code if you got 100%&gt;
 ParticleBeam: I am probably wrong.
 jacek: i think he means clash
 Astrobytes: No that's puzzles, for clash it depends if the user clicked share or not
 Astrobytes: even jacek beat me, I'll go back to debugging
 jacek: beatcek
 miszu: sricek
 miszu: :P
 ElJona174: Hi, I'm new here
 ZarthaxX: hi new
 Astrobytes: here
 miszu: when 1st year CS students do the joke: there 10 types of people. One that knows binary and others who don't.
 QuiqueLuna: hi new
 ElJona174: ochiiiiiiii
 QuiqueLuna: Im looking for an onichan
 ElJona174: Quique´s my foxy
 tarikyildiz: hello
 ElJona174: Alo
 ElJona174: Where are u?
 HorseNuggets: miszu but as programmers, we count from zero so that would hint at three people
 TiopazHc: confirmed

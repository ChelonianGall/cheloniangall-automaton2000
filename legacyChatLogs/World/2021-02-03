 pyBoy.: hello world
 ProKral6145: hello
 Banul: hello
 KiwiTae: lihoo
 geriatric1927: Hallo
 -oa-: hrello
 zhoubou: Hrwlro
 _ItzMax_: &lt;===3
 lopidav: is that an arrow?
 monkey: maybe Max is just happy to see you
 monkey: ...or is less than or really really really equal to three
 AntiSquid: less than exactly equal to 3
 AntiSquid: or it's a funny ascii drawing .
 21stCenturyPeon: Ah, I see =- it's a double-scoop ice cream cone, right?
 pyBoy.: yeah i think so
 jacek: hmm i need to rethink jacekmax. now im experimenting and getting better results with just mcts ept
 jacek: could be hyperparameter sensivity
 geriatric1927: How hard is it to maintain a rank above 50?
 jacek: what game
 geriatric1927: Clash of code of course&#160;:')
 jacek: quite hard. rank increases over time when idle
 geriatric1927: Increases or decreases? :P
 jacek: depends how you look at it. rank 30th -&gt; 60th. did it increare or decrease?
 jacek: :thinking:
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: i think jacek
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: is correct
 geriatric1927: Well, actually increase of rank means the number decreasing
 geriatric1927: I'm not saying I'm correct and he's wrong. Just that most people think of it as that way.
 Uljahn: most people think you shouldn't be bothered with CoC rank :smirk:
 jacek: yeah, when rank increases i think that means youre better
 geriatric1927: Just a question.
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: yeah when rank increases that mean u are better :smile:
 drantini: why is shortest mode even a thing
 drantini: so unfair for c#
 geriatric1927: Java:ðŸ˜¶
 Uljahn: how using a wrong tool can be unfair?
 geriatric1927: Learn any other language 
 geriatric1927: Like ruby or python
 Uljahn: ^
 geriatric1927: You'll have experience in an other language and also get a change to win shortest. So that's a win win.
 Uljahn: or you could ignore clashes and wreck ruby and python with c# in bot ai multiplayers
 geriatric1927: DrakeYes
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: yeah Uijahn is correct python or ruby can help me shortest mode of Clash Of Code
 jacek: oO
 geriatric1927: Perl too for some problems
 geriatric1927: Simple ones
 JLukeSkywalker: cool, finally beat the oware wood 2 boss

 AntiSquid: maybe i should spam in #clash chat
 AntiSquid: revenge&#160;!
 ejpon: Its too early for coders, they are still asleep.
 AntiSquid: real coders wake up at 4 AM and code .
 BlaiseEbuth: This is always 4AM somewhere...
 ejpon: Oh so what am I, if I code until 4AM and then sleep till noon?
 BlaiseEbuth: A neet&#160;?

 AntiSquid: so edgy 
 AntiSquid: should i share the invite link and pretend you get 1 free GME :thinking:
 jacek: do you get $$$ when someone plays escape with you?
 AntiSquid: no
 jacek: then why you are so eager to play with someone? :o
 AntiSquid: you need min 2 lol
 AntiSquid: but seems like certain polish people with smiley avatars are anti-social, not going to name any names
 AntiSquid: i take it back, might be wrong :P
 AntiSquid: shared link on stock exchange chat room, nobody clicking yet
 Uljahn: eh? 
 AntiSquid: you have an invite link you can use and get up to 20 people into the game with it
 AntiSquid: most of the communities i joined aren't coding sites so ...
 Uljahn: i have no friends besides Automaton2000 :confused:
 Automaton2000: like the guy who is in the same turn?
 jacek: or AutomatonNN and frog
 AutomatonNN: cool its the world of students
 Westicles: I wonder why they put it on a separate site
 jacek: they are ashamed
 struct: Maybe because its beta test?
 struct: and its not really related to cg
 AntiSquid: you just need to share it in a chat with high traffic
 trictrac: thanks Jacek for your fireworks approval :slight_smile:
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Westicles: it seems I am unable to solve the tutorial
 jacek: onboarding?
 Westicles: esc

 Uljahn: keep calm and stop overengineering
 Westicles: The same solution worked 2nd time through.  Probably user error
 zhoubou: I can join another again if you need people AntiSquid
 jacek: MSmits mcts w/ ept seems better than jacekmax now. could be hyperparameters or bugs in my earlier versions, or better NNs

 JLukeSkywalker: yeah
 JLukeSkywalker: you solve them in different languages though
 JLukeSkywalker: your top 7 i think for each get scored
 JLukeSkywalker: huh, i win most 2 and 3 player GoD, but lose almost every 4 player
 JLukeSkywalker: is it worth it writing separate algorithm based on number of players?
 MSmits: jacek it may just depend on the game

 The.Imposter: What
 The.Imposter: I'm new
 The.Imposter: How can I follow you
 MSmits: gps tracker
 The.Imposter: I meant how can I follow you on codin game
 MSmits: hover on profile pic
 The.Imposter: Thanks
 YurkovAS: MSmits in D&amp;B you use mcts?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: random moves till I can sort of solve it
 MSmits: I have an endgame solver and in the 10 turns or so before that I try nimstring analysis to come up with a move
 MSmits: so generally I play perfectly from around halfway through the game and random before that
 The.Imposter: :hamburger:

 ZarthaxX: Scarfield i didnt expect such a gift... thanks :D
 MSmits: it depends
 The.Imposter: Can people follow me and give me advice since I'm new?
 MSmits: if you use it for the endgame, then it may help you choose chains and loops effectively
 MSmits: before that, it basically does nothing
 JLukeSkywalker: ask on here, ppl will give advice. follower count is pretty meaningless
 MSmits: you and your opponent use the same board, so what would you evaluate?
 Scarfield: u welcome xD
 The.Imposter: It just makes me feel good
 The.Imposter: But thanks for telling me about the advice
 MSmits: nr 1 does what i do, but bettere
 The.Imposter: :grinning:
 ZarthaxX: done scarfo
 jacek: :o
 The.Imposter: Does anyone want to be friends with me
 MSmits: best thing you can do is dive into the mathematical theoiy. YurkovAS
 The.Imposter: :smiley:
 MSmits: theory
 Scarfield: there are a lot of advice to give, but if you have problems with a specific puzzle, make a specific question (programming language, puzzle, and issue) there most likely will be someone that can help The.Imposter&#160;:)
 Scarfield: hahaha nice zarto xD
 The.Imposter: Thank you I'm following you by the way
 ZarthaxX: maybe should put the hat a bit lower
 ZarthaxX: so the ears dont show up

 Astrobytes: Yeah ZarthaxX, how about it
 BlaiseEbuth: 2121 years already... So many candles...
 Astrobytes: Hmm, birthday... or did you have some satanic ritual going on BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: It goes hand in hand
 ZarthaxX: 2121? wtf
 ZarthaxX: dude loves satan

 ZarthaxX: struct i think
 Astrobytes: You better be available tomorrow ZarthaxX or Bad Things will happen
 ZarthaxX: *oh my*
 ZarthaxX: i will be there chief
 reCurse: What's happening tomorrow?
 JLukeSkywalker: snow
 Astrobytes: reCurse: Not much, just our rescheduled escape thingy
 Astrobytes: You should try it out if you haven't already, my only qualm (bugs aside) is the pricing question
 reCurse: Pricing?!
 Astrobytes: At the end of the session: "How much would you be willing to pay per user?" (or words to that effect
 Astrobytes: )
 Astrobytes: Check my post on discord for my thoughts on that
 ZarthaxX: oh yeah that pricing thing was a concern lol
 reCurse: I gave up on the Discord channel, too many spoilers
 Astrobytes: I mean, it's legit good fun. For a casual user, paying? Nah.
 Astrobytes: From discord: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f964ea5b-1a1b-4f9a-88c8-0bd2c8ce4c3b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f964ea5b-1a1b-4f9a-88c8-0bd2c8ce4c3b</a>
 Westicles: What happened to "I'll be giving that a miss then"?
 Astrobytes: It just seems like something for CG for Work as opposed to something viable for us lot.
 Astrobytes: Westicles: lol, I had to eat my words when TBali challenged me to try it before forming an opinion
 Westicles: heh heh.  Did you guys have audio going while playing?  Seems like a necessary component
 Astrobytes: Since I had an invite I went for it, was surprised in a good way.
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: I didn't have mic until today though so I was lagging in text chat.
 Westicles: We tried it with just chat, it wasn't pleasant
 Astrobytes: Audio is a must imo.
 Astrobytes: Pretty cool format though.
 Astrobytes: If they consider payment then for me it speaks to companies and team leaders.
 reCurse: I guess it could work as a work activity like you said
 reCurse: Though I don't know, is there really a market for that
 reCurse: Well I didn't try it but I'm not interested either
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'd be happy if my boss did something like that. I'm not sure if it's a marketable thing or not tbh.
 Westicles: It was tougher than expected, and we had euler so I just got to watch him go
 Astrobytes: I wasn't interested overly much but it was actually harder than we thought
 reCurse: The thing is escape rooms work in person
 Astrobytes: lol yeah, what difficulty/level did you do Westicles?
 reCurse: Online? Meh.
 Astrobytes: Don't take the escape room thing too literally in this case
 reCurse: The whole purpose is team bonding so if you do it online, though I guess my mind isn't adjusted post-covid yet...
 Westicles: It was the airlock one, easy I think
 Astrobytes: We did the 80s medium one
 Astrobytes: *Back to the 80s
 Astrobytes: Bear in mind that me and struct (at least) went in with very low expectations.
 Westicles: I wouldn't mind going through them alone, not really interesting in the team part
 struct: yes and completing the tutorial did not help at all with the  expectation
 Astrobytes: ^
 reCurse: So we're going to be flooded with clashers AND escapers now? -_-
 Astrobytes: I think you can do them alone Westicles but it is kinda cool with a team on audio.
 Astrobytes: reCurse: this is why I question who they are targeting here.
 struct: I think for solo you have better Alternate reality games
 Astrobytes: I cannot see the vast mahjority of CG users signing up to it, especially if paid
 reCurse: I just can't see them monetizing that unless it's done privately like they do for contests etc
 Astrobytes: *majority (too much mahjong :P )
 reCurse: So I'm assuming f2p at some point
 reCurse: I could be way off mark
 Wontonimo: i think someone up in management went to an escape maze and just can't shut up about it, so to appease them ... CG escape maze
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but this is why I mentioned microtransactions, f2p initially but unlocking more costs...
 Wontonimo: i mean, i like escape maze as much as the next guy, but I haven't really got much out of online ones
 reCurse: MTX is necessary
 reCurse: This is how the market goes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I get that - but on CG?
 reCurse: It's a game, it's online, it obeys the same rules
 Astrobytes: Meh. Actually, given the recent discord discussion - yes.
 Ianc14: Hi guys, do you know what kind of questions I might find in a company's codingame programming interview?
 Astrobytes: fizzbuzz in asm, dijkstra in clojure, that kinda thing
 Wontonimo: in an interview, probably something easier than "easy" in CG
 Astrobytes: (I'm joking)
 Wontonimo: if you can do all easy, you'll be GTG
 Astrobytes: Think they're usually up to medium, depends on the company
 Wontonimo: are you actually directed to CG for interviews in France?
 Astrobytes: No, just whoever signs up to their screening programme
 Astrobytes: So if you interview with one of those companies you might get a CG test
 Wontonimo: in Canada, a coding interview is usually a task completed at a white board.  The main skills involved is being able to write psudo code without googling it while talking out loud and being open to critique 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I mean I don't think it's like the be all and end all of the interview process, just a part
 struct: but is that the first interview?
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm off  to bed. Gn all, see you tomorrow
 struct: gn
 therealbeef: i wonder if those coding interviews are useful
 therealbeef: i never do it when interviewing candidates
 reCurse: To assess fitness for a role, no. To make sure you're not dealing with a pretender, yes.
 therealbeef: i find it more important that they can design
 reCurse: And the latter is very necessary, trust me.
 Wontonimo: pretenders or horrible
 reCurse: Same thing
 therealbeef: you get a lot of pretenders?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i agree with reCurse
 reCurse: Well let's just say I was in the camp of "those tests are useless"
 reCurse: Until I actually had to do interviews on the employer side
 reCurse: And oh boy yes we need them.
 reCurse: Some of the answers I've read...
 Wontonimo: i had a candidate not know how many Kb is in a Mb. ... and they said they had 8 years experience
 Wontonimo: they thought it was somewhere between 8 and 20
 Westicles: I had a phone interview with spaceX.  They give you a problem, 3 days to work on it, then fly you out to present the solution.  Kind of hardcore
 therealbeef: i do find that seniority doesnt mean much in some countries
 reCurse: Try in general
 reCurse: It is very possible to surf doing very little for many years
 Wontonimo: I used to have a few OO questions that I was proud of for interviewees.  Then I had a recursion question for interviewees.  Now I stick with fizzbuzz level and try to get more talking and unit test examples out of them.
 Ianc14: yes its the first interview and it redirects me on CG
 Wontonimo: i'm also okay with candidates using google
 struct: Interviews should be done on CoC
 struct: gn
 Wontonimo: Good luck Ianc14
 Wontonimo: whatever you do, make sure if you are called into an interview you can do that same problem in person and explain why
 Ianc14: Ty msn
 Ianc14: man*
 Ianc14: man*
 therealbeef: it's kind of a gut feeling often. i've accepted candidates that barely knew C++ but understood design, or candidates that were very quiet and hard to get answers out of. what matters for me is if they have the potential to learn things on the job and are open to be 'shaped', and (very important) if they fit in the team atmosphere
 Ianc14: I've been studying for 6 years and it still takes 4 interviews and tests to start working, it gets nerve-racking
 Wontonimo: if it helps, remember that you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing your.  As for the coding challenge itself, another way of taking the anxiety away is to believe that you'll do the best you can but in the end it is mostly a lottery if they find the one specific secret thing they are looking for in your code.  You can't really do anything about it other than to do less than your regular.
 Wontonimo: like poker, you can't always win a hand, but if you play enough and play right you will eventually win.  There is nothing you can do to get a specific job, that's chance.  Just keep on interviewing
 skotz: anyone have tips for dealing with the c# gc while trying to do a bfs?
 jacek: depends on the job. im android developer, but i have stuff on github or play store published and i'd rather talk about them during interview than many technical questions
 jacek: skotz this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/32007523/3122936">https://stackoverflow.com/a/32007523/3122936</a>
 skotz: yeah, i've been messing with that for a while with no luck
 jacek: use nonGC language [solved]
 skotz: :thumbsup:

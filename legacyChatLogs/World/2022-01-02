 DialFrost: hello world
 Hwan_Jo: hi everyone
 ammari: hi there
 RustSwordsman: hello
 n0b1e: hey
 Bertinator: dried grass
 ammari: yo guys i liked this website
 ammari: i'm using it to improve my python skills
 DialFrost: &lt;33
 jacek: aww
 MSmits: jacek, I've been working on my meta mcts with 36 seed book and I am testing some games to see how good your bot is
 MSmits: this game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/600200948">https://www.codingame.com/replay/600200948</a>
 MSmits: your bot plays perfectly till frame 47, then my bot makes a mistake in the endgame book
 MSmits: meaning the book is not in my live bot so it cant use it, but i can check it locally
 MSmits: when i say perfectly it means every move your bot plays is aimed at maximum net seed gain
 MSmits: i'll check the rest of the game, but your bot is ahead then so it doesnt have to play perfectly from then on
 MSmits: yeah that's funny, it makes a mistake itself only 2 frames later, but it doesn't matter. I guess thats what happens when you train for winning instead of seeds gained
 MSmits: oware bots have gotten ridiculously good
 MSmits: so I can't even counterbook you with the meta unless I include parts of my 36 seed endgame book in my bot. 
 MSmits: I'm going to try to train a nn with that book so i don't have to... that's the plan anyways
 Daporan: MSmits, how do you know the early moves are perfect?
 MSmits: I run a meta mcts which, instead of playing games till the end, it plays games till &lt;=36 seeds and backpropagates the result. That makes them very accurate and fast
 MSmits: it's a very simple game with on average only a branching of 5 and many bad moves, so it's easy to converge all the way on the endgame book
 MSmits: i have a 60 GB endgame book with all possible states with &lt;=36 seeds
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Hi, everyone how are you?
 MSmits: hi ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't answer the "how are you" part
 COOLERR: .....
 MSmits: it can be extracted from my sermon
 eulerscheZahl: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 MSmits: ohnoes
 eulerscheZahl: my standard reaction to someone else writing a bunch of dots, less funny when you already see what's about to happen before it even really started&#160;:(
 MSmits: well you did it often enough now&#160;:)
 MSmits: so i recognize
 eulerscheZahl: next time i'll trick you into thinking i did
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: You are from where @MSmits
 MSmits: says on my profile. The Netherlands
 eulerscheZahl: from a city named "Private"
 MSmits: yes
 eulerscheZahl: that's where counterbalance is from as well, isn't he?
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: here how to tag someone? i means by which symbol?
 MSmits: yes he is also from private
 MSmits: type start of name
 MSmits: then tab
 eulerscheZahl: just write the name and it will be red for that one person
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: MSmits  not works
 MSmits: it works
 MSmits: you did it
 MSmits: message is red for me ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN
 Daporan: MSmits, maybe you can train a NN and then "fill the gaps" with the book to create a perfect bot. Think of the NN as a lossy compression algorithm.
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: really thanks for help me to tag someone.
 MSmits: yeah Daporan that was exactly my plan. Basically the endgame book (the game between 36 and 9 seeds) i dont have in my live bot because it obviously doesnt fit. so i was going to train that part
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: i 'm new here to learn python and also improve my english so please help!!
 MSmits: the early game can just have an opening book, doesnt have to be big and if the opponent deviates from it too much then he's playing bad anyway and i can just use the nn to play it ou
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: MSmits here the coding is so difficult
 MSmits: we have simple puzzles too, but of course everything is relative, so simple might not be simple for you.  Or maybe it is, depends on your experience
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: its very different from pycharm
 MSmits: you mean the IDE they use. Then don't use it
 MSmits: paste the code into your pycharm and work there, then paste it back to test it
 MSmits: thats how i work most of the time
 MSmits: except for very short puzzles
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: yeah but the puzzles code not working in the IDE
 MSmits: ahh i mean you cant do test cases, true, for those you need to paste the code in the CG IDE, you cant test in pycharm
 MSmits: unless you set something up to use the same input, but that might be too much work for a simple puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: i usually copy-paste the CG input into a text file and set that as stdin for my IDE
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you beat me on it
 MSmits: yeah, i've maybe once or twice done that, but usually i dont
 MSmits: i have to think about how to do that, so it takes me more time
 eulerscheZahl: i do it for bigger things (bot, optim) but also for puzzle contests like codeforces, codejam
 eulerscheZahl: for all other cases i just that junk-project that i reuse when i don't need it anymore
 MSmits: I used it for your number shifting puzzle, but you provided helpful code
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: The logic of CG IDE is very different from PyCharm
 MSmits: no doubt, i usually use visual studio for C# and C++. Also very different
 eulerscheZahl: not when you set up your project properly
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: CG IDE is like professional
 MSmits: oh you're saying CG is better
 MSmits: i guess for python it's different
 eulerscheZahl: that's the first time is see someone calling it like that
 MSmits: maybe for python it's good?
 eulerscheZahl: it's still mostly a text editor with a language server that often loses connection
 MSmits: I admit  i had no problems using it for python in simple puzzles
 MSmits:  I guess if you dont need the intellisense much, you dont miss it
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: the CG IDE is out of my mind range..:joy::joy:
 eulerscheZahl: and the lack of debugging, breakpoints, ... is an absolute dealbreaker to me
 eulerscheZahl: on top i use git versioning for my bots
 MSmits: yeah I guess I almost never use advanced debugging features in IDEs
 MSmits: I dont think i ever used a breakpoint :P
 eulerscheZahl: you never fail to surprise me
 MSmits: I am very creative with console debug messages&#160;:)
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: MSmits are you python developer?
 MSmits: not really no, i use python for work sometimes
 MSmits: but i teach so they are simple things and toy projects
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes those debug messages can be helpful. when your BFS stops working 20 iterations in and you don't want to do all those debugger steps
 MSmits: how would you use a breakpoint for that?
 MSmits: i would just have a counter and use binary search to find the correct iteration
 eulerscheZahl: i mean cerr
 eulerscheZahl: there are conditional breakpoints, sure. but i rarely use them, makes the code running much slower
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Actually i learned python basic from youtube (CodewithHarry) but here&#160;?????
 eulerscheZahl: if (condition) System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break() :angel:
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: i guess i would just use an actual "break" and debug messages
 MSmits: to break out of whatver loop
 eulerscheZahl: when you know the basics of python, just make sure that you also know input() and print(), then you are ready to go here on codingame
 MSmits: ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN the input structure takes some getting used to maybe (the while loop for different turns in some puzzles), but once you get that, using python here is very basic
 MSmits: this time you were faster
 eulerscheZahl: user level at 9 already, so you seemingly understood how to use the website already
 MSmits: ah yeah level 9 means quite a few puzzles done
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: MSmits in every Clash of Code i have 0% score............:sob::sob:
 MSmits: ahh who cares about clash, I am not that great at them either, usually i dont win
 MSmits: time limits suck
 MSmits: any time you dont find the solution in time, it's just wasted time
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Give some ideas 
 MSmits: do puzzles until you get tired of them, then do optims and multis
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: MSmits your good name please?
 MSmits: thats the correct way to use CG
 MSmits: my good name?
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Ok Thanks for your ideas
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: are you using a translator?
 MSmits: it's fine, i am just wondering
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: yeah i'm asking about your name?
 MSmits: msmits is my real name
 MSmits: the rest of the m being private :P
 MSmits: but if you are really dedicated i can be found i suppose. Not too worried
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: smits is ok but m for what?
 MSmits: private&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: M for Mad
 MSmits: sure that works
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: no i cant use translator at all
 Husoski: Messer?
 MSmits: hah no
 MSmits: that sounds German
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: its means you are mad....:joy: ok sorry
 MSmits: heh thats ok, I have actually shared my real name here before, but it's a bad habit
 MSmits: don't want an angry Polish person at my door because i counterbooked his bot
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Sir don't mind ok i'm new here
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: no no every person are good but they react a bad behave by his tention
 jacek: :rage;
 jacek: :rage:
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: I didn't do it yet jacek, hold off on the rage&#160;:)
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: i 'm too weak in english......but  please manage
 MSmits: we try 
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: thats good 
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Is there any Afghani in Netherland
 MSmits: yeah I am sure we have some refugees
 MSmits: not sure how many
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Ok ...... How they react&#160;?
 MSmits: did you flee from Afghanistan or have you grown up in Pakistan?
 MSmits: i dont know any personally
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Yeah i'm basically from Afghanistan but now  studying in Pakistan
 MSmits: but you won't go back will you?
 MSmits: you really shouldn't, if you have a choice
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: i ts means you don't phase any refugee
 MSmits: phase?
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: sorry face....
 MSmits: no i don't know any refugees personally, but there might be a camp somewhere nearby. 
 MSmits: or maybe they live in ordinary houses. I havent looked into it much
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: i will back to my country after complete master Degree
 MSmits: aren't you afraid about how things are now?
 MSmits: i guess it might be different depending on your background, but for us westerners it seems like a bad place to be
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: everything's is ok for us because we grown up in that type of situation 
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: so you just want to go back and help build up your country under whatever circumstances you run into?
 MSmits: I respect that.
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: Yeah i want to do something better for my country and build up  and also train my peoples
 MSmits: that's great
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: A lot of my country peoples are uneducated that's why there are many problems are going on. 
 MSmits: yes, education is everything
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: by the why i love cricket
 MSmits: haha yes I know cricket is big over there
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: and we have a series with your country team...:joy: in this month
 MSmits: oh really. I suspect we suck, but i have no idea
 MSmits: this is a soccer country mostly
 MSmits: but we do well in some other sports
 MSmits: skating, hockey i think
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: its means you are not interested in cricket...:joy:
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: but the guys that will be playing your team are obviously very interested
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: i am too confused what should i do in my final project???? 
 MSmits: I would always go for something with AI, but that might be too hard. 
 MSmits: maybe a simple tic tac toe game?
 jacek: master project?
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: yaa i have a subject Artificial Intelligence  in 6th, 7th, 8th semester
 struct: ttt seems way too simple for final project
 MSmits: nice!
 MSmits: yeah for a master project it is
 MSmits: if it's just a 1 semester python coding class it's fine
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: no Bachelor projects
 jacek: still too simple
 MSmits: hard to say really
 MSmits: would have to see the course material to see how deep it goes
 MSmits: if it is completely introductory to coding it should be hard enough
 ALI_KHAN_AFGHAN: ok i'm to eat something......if you want  i can parcel you
 MSmits: parcel?
 struct: just do some ML stuff
 MSmits: ML is fun
 jacek: i think he means message or DM/PM
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: yeah sure
 Astrobytes: parcel-&gt;mail-&gt;email?
 MSmits: a wild astrobytes appears!
 Astrobytes: I've been here for ages
 MSmits: yeah lurking, i tabbed you earler when trying to ping ali
 Astrobytes: I said M for Mad earlier
 jacek: why would you ping Astrobytes needlessly
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: maybe you've just become part of the furniture and i dont register :P
 Astrobytes: it's not annoying anymore jacek 
 Astrobytes: possible :D
 jacek: Automaton2000 is it true?
 Automaton2000: we are more "abstract based" :d
 awesomedude123: hey i need some help. The clash I am doing right now is asking to do a "XORing" over a list
 eulerscheZahl: "a wild astrobytes appears!"Illedan sent him
 awesomedude123: but i am confused what that even means
 awesomedude123: does someone mind explaining
 MSmits: xoring means using the bit operation "xor" or ^
 eulerscheZahl: XOR over list of integers?
 awesomedude123: yeah a list of ints
 Astrobytes: I was already here eulerscheZahl, just didn't have the tab open
 awesomedude123: do I have to do some operation on the integer?
 awesomedude123: like using ^
 eulerscheZahl: in most languages: a XOR b is written asa ^ b
 eulerscheZahl: basically it takes the binary form of the numbers and checks digit by digit
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate</a>
 MSmits: green truth table is the most helpful
 eulerscheZahl: 0^0 = 00^1=11^1=0
 eulerscheZahl: XOR = exclusive or
 MSmits: but yeah just using the operation "^" blindly should work too
 MSmits: i guess you dont even have to know what it does
 eulerscheZahl: and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-binary-converter">https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-binary-converter</a>for understanding
 awesomedude123: cause the list consists of 1 and 0 but I am unsure what to do. Do I just do like 1^0
 MSmits: depends on the problem description
 MSmits: xoring one number with another means doing a ^b 
 eulerscheZahl: what coding language?
 awesomedude123: python
 struct: I think its already in binary form
 MSmits: ohh that makes things difficult
 eulerscheZahl: result = 0for n in list: result ^= nprint(result)
 MSmits: you need to write a converter from binary to decimal
 struct: no MSmits
 struct: you just need a for loop
 MSmits: or xor them character by character i guess
 struct: and a[i] ^ b[i]
 MSmits: ah right that works
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=xor&amp;category=CLASHOFCODE&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=xor&amp;category=CLASHOFCODE&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on</a>
 eulerscheZahl: way too much
 eulerscheZahl: such an original theme
 eulerscheZahl: might be <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1268a2ed4d50a09abd4d5b396abc79e23cc">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1268a2ed4d50a09abd4d5b396abc79e23cc</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and CodinBot broke the formatting while deactivating reverse. I wonder if that also affects the version visible to clashers
 eulerscheZahl: can't even open it with the lower button
 MSmits: so many xor puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: sum(nums)&#160;% 2would also do the trick
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/90851486e43c909c4a32c7dfb9f2deb15e22b9">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/90851486e43c909c4a32c7dfb9f2deb15e22b9</a>
 awesomedude123: thanks guys
 awesomedude123: got it
 eulerscheZahl: powerful struct with his 300+ clashes
 struct: missing a 0
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: input()print(sum(map(int, input().split()))%2)
 eulerscheZahl: did it
 MSmits: magic
 eulerscheZahl: johnson
 MSmits: sure
 jacek: no need to use xor, just train nn for it
 eulerscheZahl: but all the different input sizes :scream:
 jacek: use RNN [solved]
 struct: so this is what I need to stop NNs, different board sizes
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tulips-and-daisies">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tulips-and-daisies</a>
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: it definitely helps in making it harder to stop NN's.
 MSmits: but it wont stop it definitively, it just stops nn creators that are not that good at it
 MSmits: re curse was able to use his toto zero with many different starting boards. Not different sizes, but different setups
 MSmits: well there were dead hexes so kind of different sizes
 struct: :thinking:
 MSmits: you'd basically either make completely different networks based on how many different sizes there are or you'd mask unusable hexes/cells
 MSmits: probably the masking is more codesize-efficient
 struct: probably yes
 jacek: sc2021 has fixed size, just mask unused hexes
 jacek: CNN suffers less from changing board size, as the go bots were still good for 21x21 and 17x17 sizes
 jacek: also there are some tricks  to make it board size invariant i.e. havannah <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havannah#Computer_Havannah">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havannah#Computer_Havannah</a>
 MSmits: yeah that was my point though, it's an extra step to make it harder for nn creators
 MSmits: it also makes them less efficient I think, maybe requiring a larger network
 MSmits: oh and CNN itself is already beyond many of our NN creators. The ones that use Marchetes framework for example
 struct: too many types of NNs
 MSmits: well thats good
 MSmits: I like variety
 MSmits: it's cool how many types work on oware
 MSmits: could also be a sign that the game is too simple

 BlaiseEbuth: Mods&#160;! Ban eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: ban BlaiseEbuth and get a free pass from Thibaud
 BlaiseEbuth: Works too.
 BlaiseEbuth: Pass for what&#160;?
 struct: double or nothing?
 eulerscheZahl: pass for banning a well known user
 BlaiseEbuth: An achievement so?
 eulerscheZahl: still waiting for them to remove my contest creator achievement
 eulerscheZahl: or contest participant :smirk:
 BlaiseEbuth: And the aneo ones
 eulerscheZahl: they are still there?
 jacek: why would they remove them
 eulerscheZahl: you can't create a community contest anymore, so that one is clear
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course they are. On CG the only thing that can be deleted is my account.
 eulerscheZahl: "happy birthday, play 12 contests"that takes 6 years if we have 2 contests a year, which sounds questionable to me
 Astrobytes: Meh. Who cares? :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't question, you'll be banned.
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have backups of all my bots
 Astrobytes: fixit
 BlaiseEbuth: Time to get them...
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a script for me?
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/">https://chadok.info/codingame/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no, for downloading my codes
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, item 6
 eulerscheZahl: cool, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i'm always impressed what you can do with bash if you know how
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... If you know how :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: me creating a folder so i can copy the target path into the script'/home/eulerschezahl/Documents/Programming/challenges/CodinGame/backup' already exists, aborting.
 eulerscheZahl: it's doing something
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes, the script is not really flexible ^^ I had to try several times before I got it to work properly.
 eulerscheZahl: skipped the python2 backup but that's fine with me i guess
 eulerscheZahl: i know i could just comment that 1 line back in again
 eulerscheZahl: and it lacks parallelism, my replay downloader uses 50 threads by default until CG temporarily blocks me
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it even has a sleep not to stress more
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah there's a bunch of amelioration to do. But on the other hand, you only have to run it one time... So...
 eulerscheZahl: i just let it run
 eulerscheZahl: codegolf finished already, on easy now. would take me longer to code it all by myself
 jacek: do you trust blaise that much? what if it sends the code to him
 Astrobytes: not his script
 eulerscheZahl: i have the bash code here, readable
 eulerscheZahl: and i bet it's authored by stilgart himself
 eulerscheZahl: in case you are here (i don't see the list of all users anymore): thank you very much
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:( You're so mean jacek.
 eulerscheZahl: hmpf, also skipped my swift3
 eulerscheZahl: that brilliant marslander1 solution
 eulerscheZahl: would be a true loss to humanity
 eulerscheZahl: it also creates folders if you haven't even tried the puzzle?
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yes, all the folders are created.
 Astrobytes: definitely written by Stilgart 
 eulerscheZahl: that's expensive, do you think all these folders grow on trees?
 eulerscheZahl: ban pun, couldn't resist
 eulerscheZahl: bad*
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: I didn't let it finish since I already have my backups.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm 20 puzzles into the easy community ones now
 eulerscheZahl: with a 10s sleep after each one
 eulerscheZahl: screw this, i'll stress the server
 eulerscheZahl: and get my python2+swift3
 jacek: what if you get banned
 eulerscheZahl: as long as the script finishes before
 eulerscheZahl: already overtook the sleeper script
 eulerscheZahl: i've downloaded tens of thousands of OoC replays during the recalc as soon as they were played, nothing ever happened of it. even asked if it's ok on the private game creation discord channel
 jacek: private game creation discord channel :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: on CG discord, each community contest got its own private channel just for creators
 eulerscheZahl: at least after they moved away from slack
 eulerscheZahl: i still have a folder with 46472 replay files
 eulerscheZahl: 46.472 items, totalling 4,9&#160;GB

 skim2086: Does anyone have a solution for ASCII Cube in Haskell? I've been at it for 6 days now, but I Can't figure it out for the life of me...
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure Stilgart did. he solved it and Haskell is his default language
 eulerscheZahl: oh yes, with haskell 5 months ago
 skim2086: I presume there isn't any easy way for me to check it if I haven't completed it at all, right?
 eulerscheZahl: you can hope that stilgart or JBM are online and willing to reply
 skim2086: Hmmm, aight, thank you :D
 JBM: lol
 JBM: AA is easy, I'm sure even eZ has an answer to that
 eulerscheZahl: my haskell doesn't go beyond a "hello world" and i'm allergic to ascii art

 Assasint: What up
 Ooflord: what is the best website to learn python 3? 
 Ooflord: nothing much
 Ooflord: bc im trying to learn but i cant find a good free course
 Assasint: I know one site
 Ooflord: what is is? :0
 EEtojSUM: codecadamy is a good one but the python 3 course is not free
 Ooflord: yeah 
 Ooflord: i learned a bit of python 3 with codecademy but it wont let me learn more
 Assasint: It great
 Ooflord: i tried learning python 2 with codecademy but its really outdated
 EEtojSUM: i was learning from programming with mosh
 EEtojSUM: he has a great course
 Ooflord: ohhhh k ill give that a try
 HungryBurger: I've been satisfied with the Python examples on this site:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">https://www.w3schools.com/python/</a>
 Ooflord: okay tysm guys ill give mosh and w3schools a try
 Assasint: I know a  other site it call udimi
 EEtojSUM: and he also gives a lot of challenges through out the course
 EEtojSUM: good luck
 EEtojSUM: python is really easy to learn and its so much fun
 Assasint: It fun learning
 EEtojSUM: yep
 bmacho: PYTHON IS SO MUCH FUN 
 Assasint: YEP
 EEtojSUM: i'm still learning python and clashofcode helps me so much
 jacek: really oO
 EEtojSUM: its a good website to learn problem solving skills
 Assasint: Really so
 Astrobytes: :rolling_eyes:
 Assasint: Why are making that head
 Assasint: Set a point
 Assasint: Mhhh
 eulerscheZahl: clash of code just is unpopular among some of us
 Assasint: Why
 eulerscheZahl: if you enjoy it, go ahead. if you really want to dive deeper into things and not just solve simple problems, go to harder puzzles or multiplayer games
 Assasint: I already did
 TheDice: I always ran out of time in clash of code :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: reaching bronze in mad pod racing doesn't count
 Assasint: I reach gold in Mad Pod Racing
 Astrobytes: TheDice: there are no time limitations on the regular (non-clash) puzzles
 Ooflord: im trying to learn by practicing python with "The Descent"
 Astrobytes: Good! 
 Assasint: I t  is really symple to win the descent
 TheDice: imma check that out
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I wonder if you could make one program that solves all easy puzzles
 Assasint: I have win it in one shot
 eulerscheZahl: you kind of did that Mrs.GloriaZindlebockeryou wrote a program that generated solving programs
 Assasint: Really
 eulerscheZahl: if you really want to submit 1 code everywhere? probably not, or at least not deterministically as you have to detect which puzzle based on a single digit as input sometimes
 Assasint: I know that
 Assasint: Already
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't talking to you
 Assasint: To ho
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Yeah, I guess that wouldn't work.  Too many common inputs
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Well, you could read the text files in the directory I guess
 eulerscheZahl: in theory it could work. but would need thousands of submits to get that lucky random run
 eulerscheZahl: uh, interesting idea
 eulerscheZahl: does that work for interactive ones?
 Mario980: Guys what is the best site to learn python?
 TheDice: Nice I solved The Descent
 Assasint: You know I have already solve the descent
 Assasint: 4th Dimension
 Assasint: I have solve The Descent
 ninjadip: i'm sorry, but idk, what's that puzzle about, briefly
 ninjadip: Assasint
 TheDice: It gives you some numbers as input and you need the output the highest number
 eulerscheZahl: the index of the highest number
 TheDice: oh, yeah, forgot that
 eulerscheZahl: C# got a MaxBy recently. but not available on CG yet
 barmiextreme: anyone with java knowledge here? i just cannot get the chuck norris thing running in "Unary".. (i know my code is messy:D)
 ninjadip: oh that unary is a nightmare
 barmiextreme: oh thanks then im not alone
 AdnaneCoder: hi
 AdnaneCoder: how are you
 AdnaneCoder:&#160;?
 AdnaneCoder: h r u
 AdnaneCoder: hru
 e_fishel: i'm good
 e_fishel: thanks for asking
 e_fishel: and you?
 S4IF: yoo guys I just did 100% on python test any congrats&#160;?&#160;:) &lt;3
 e_fishel: poggers
 bmacho: nice
 bmacho: I wonder that I have a certification too, and I give them my name too, is that visible from my profile?
 bmacho: if you click the certification
 bmacho: *gave
 5DN1L: No, we can't see your name
 bmacho: thanks 
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Frogmit: Is there no string interpolation for java script&#160;?
 Frogmit: nevermind didn't see it needed back ticks
 MSmits: no idea what back ticks are
 Frogmit: it's this char: `
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: and what's string interpolation again?
 MSmits: is that when you put a variable inside the quotes of a string?
 Frogmit: Yes, exactly with generally the format "${var}"
 Astrobytes: that's when you interpolate a string :smirk:
 MSmits: ah ok thanks
 MSmits: Astrobytes explained it best
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 jacek: oO
 DialFrost: morning
 bmacho: 2am
 Flaise: Hey guys
 ArcherTao: How to make Thor move angle
 Blokops: "NE" for north east
 Blokops: "SE", "SW" and so on and on
 Flaise: Thor move direction Thor want move. Thor no need directions from scrawny programerers.
 MSmits: Hulk smash
 jacek: oO
 RevantMV: hi
 Dren: hello

 Japhy2112: Hey all, anyone use source control from the online editor?
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: also, YES I DID IT
 Smelty: turns out you didnt need to add any indexes afterwards
 coldcatzzz: 666
 Japhy2112: Using Chrome... assuming there is a source control plug-in out there? I have almost lost some good, err OK code.
 gargert: anyone know how to make their own puzzles on the website?
 gargert: well that suckes
 Stormalix: yes!
 Stormalix: just go to community -&gt; contributions

 BlaiseEbuth: Why people say me hi in the middle of the night?
 Natanalel: why are you here in the moddle of the night?
 Passifi: BlaiseButh don't know which part of france your living in but its not the middle of the night in europe :P
 Passifi: night is when its dark outside&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: maybe he is in the carabeans
 Natanalel: in the beans
 Passifi: Oh an imperialist oppressor, in that case they might said hy to force you to check your privlige
 BlaiseEbuth: Somebody ping me to say hi at 5am.
 Passifi: booty call&#160;?
 KiwiTae: BlaiseEbuth 5am is morning time 
 VizGhar: BlaiseEbuth say hi at 5am
 BlaiseEbuth: You're a bird, you can't understand kiwi...
 Passifi: yepp for Kiwi it's a matter of catching the worm or not

 BlaiseEbuth: -&gt; #escape
 Date____________________________: hi
 Passifi: ahhhhh I really can't seem to wrap my head around doing bfs stuff -_-
 dreadylein: why&#160;?&#160;:)
 dreadylein: which part is making you problems&#160;?
 Passifi: I think I understand it in theory but when I try to implement it for a concret example it always ends up super overcomplicated ^^ 
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a matter of practice. After some time you'll write bfs without even thinking.
 dreadylein: agree&#160;:) just stick through it, it will get easier 
 dreadylein: if you allready did it a bunch of times and it still ends up complicated, it can help to write it down beforehand
 dreadylein: just write down in broad strokes the single pieces and how they have to work together
 Passifi: so I tried to do the labyrinth puzzle for example and then I sit there and build a little data structure with nodes to connect so I go through each part of the map and connect everything that has a '.' (means you can go there) but then I think about how to find the shortest path through all the connections and it just seems like I have to iterate over everything to do so and well then nothing is gained&#160;;) 
 Passifi: yeah I guess its just one of these problems where i can't really visualize the solution well and then i always run into trouble&#160;;)
 Passifi: but thinks for the motivational input I'll just bash my head against the wall a little longer&#160;:)
 dreadylein: you wont iterate over all&#160;:)
 dreadylein: just until you see your target node
 dreadylein: i guess that what you allready meant&#160;:) just wanted to clarify
 jacek: bfs? use queue [solved]
 VizGhar: Blaise is right I came here not knowing those algorithms... BFS and DFS are now extremely simple to write for me.
 VizGhar: and if you find something complicated break it into small fully working parts
 rtghhjgh: just now im trying to solve labyrinth too. i can not understand how to do right steps to open hidden area and find  "control room"&#160;?
 VizGhar: try to reach unknown cell
 Passifi: well thats the miracle of learning you think you can't do it then it clicks and you don't know how it was hard. The sad part is even knowing what I've overcome in the past it still always feels like this time my mind is at its limit for sure&#160;;)
 VizGhar: if you try to reach closest (BFS/floodfill) unknown cell every move, you will never reach it (since it gets uncovered) but you will explore whole map
 Passifi: yeah that was my approach too. Not sure but I think when the map is still covered in fog there really is no better way then randomly exploring&#160;? I think the real challenge is making sure you take the shortest way back
 Alex-1: hii guys
 dreadylein: hey
 lazystick: hi
 Passifi: hola
 lazystick: hola
 rtghhjgh: if i see "control room" i can do pathfinding from current step to "cr" and after from "cr" to starting position.

 Alex-1: Okk bro
 Astrobytes: Since I'm not talking I'm most likely busy, so don't unless you need something important.
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't call me bro.
 Alex-1: i say okk to you and bro to Astro
 lazystick: lmao
 VizGhar: do moderators get more then visual notification?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't call him bro.
 BlaiseEbuth: Notifs for what&#160;?

 FlexYourJS: are they rebooting servers that build code?
 FlexYourJS: *currently
 FlexYourJS: i'm getting #510
 Secret_sister2: (.づ◡﹏◡)づ. who wants free huggies?
 BlaiseEbuth: Please observe barrier gestures in public chats. Thanks
 Astrobytes: Slow servers are just Blaise mining souls again most likely
 BlaiseEbuth: Shhht... Astro! :rage:
 Astrobytes: :P
 Cubix: ^^Après, je n'ai aucun soucis sur d'autres niveaux
 BlaiseEbuth: Bad chan Cubix ^^
 Cubix: Yep, saw that too late $$
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 BlaiseEbuth: Erf. Seems they've found my Hell backdoor...&#160;:(Next time I will affect Cerberus to it. Time is souls.
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 BlaiseEbuth: חתול טיפש 
 Astrobytes: Oi!
 Illedan: Servers slow?
 Illedan: I guess I should disable my Doge coin mining in all my bots
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Blaise was mining souls, you're mining doge coin, who knows who else is mining what :P
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a fruitful alliance. He corrupt the souls and I harvest them.
 Astrobytes: Sounds workable
 euph0ria: a question from a noob.. in code clashes.. seems like everyone is using pythong because it's dense.. for the short code challenges using kotlin and having to import a few things kind of makes it impossible to win, any thoughts on this?
 BlaiseEbuth: First don't do clashs, second don't use kotlin.
 euph0ria: please elaborate
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmmm... Clashs are just speed competitions and will not teach you anything. (Except for shortest, but it's limited to the more compacts languages so meh)
 Astrobytes: pythong? Underwear for snakes?
 BlaiseEbuth: -_-
 BlaiseEbuth: And about kotlin... I mean, it's kotlin right. :smirk:
 BlaiseEbuth: You're such a troll Astrobytes. Why are you still moderator...
 lazystick: :o
 Westicles: Funny, almost everyone comes here to do clashes, asks a question, and are told by the appointed reps that they shouldn't do clashes
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a slow process of mass education.
 Astrobytes: And after re-education, some still just want to clash, some explore further. That's win-win.
 1rdin: i have no idea what to do
 synchoz: as a noob that did clashes untill now should i just do the Practice area to to get faster education :o&#160;?
 JorgeBernal: hey guys we are doing the first scape room but are stuck on a part and there is no hints has anyone done it before
 Astrobytes: Clashes are supposed to be for fun synchoz, so yeah, you'd probably learn more in the Practice section tbh
 Astrobytes: *just for fun
 BlaiseEbuth: 'fun'
 euph0ria: hehe
 Astrobytes: Yeah, fun is ofc subjective.
 1rdin: guys how am i supposed to get 2 from 0 0&#160;?

 BlaiseEbuth: Adding 2&#160;?
 synchoz: thx hehe, untill now i thought  clashes would help me in the education area but good thing i see the chat :X
 joniebear: Clashes ARE good for learning if you don't care about winning them... 
 euph0ria: yeah, that's what I will do with Kotlin.. since python will beat all always
 euph0ria: i just want to learn kotlin, don't care about winning.. except when I win, then I'm happy hehe
 BlaiseEbuth: People are stranges...
 euph0ria: and besides, who wants to code using underwear for snakes
 Astrobytes: joniebear: most of the clash problems aren't particularly educational, the puzzles have a bit more depth to them (there are exceptions ifc)
 Astrobytes: *ofc
 Astrobytes: euph0ria :rofl:
 joniebear: How is "more depth" translating to "more educational"? 
 BlaiseEbuth: If you want to learn deep things?
 Astrobytes: Right. Let me put it like this: what will you learn from a clash that wants the shortest version of n*n?
 Illedan: Anyone else has problems with the visualizer in Oware when dragging the timeline?
 BlaiseEbuth: Illedan... Oware? Go clash now.
 Astrobytes: The visualiser's always been a bit funky in Oware tbh, and takes about a day to load.
 lazystick: well, good luck everyone in upcoming contest&#160;: p
 Illedan: Clash? What is this?
 Westicles: I'm surprised the hoi polloi like escape.  I only did one, but it seemed kind of tough
 SeZuo: shortest n*n&#160;: Depends on language. For instance&#160;: which spaces are deteminant&#160;? Do you need that parenthesis&#160;? Gives you better understanding of the synthax
 Astrobytes: hoi polloi, lol. Well, some are easier than others
 struct: just checked console
 struct: so many errors
 RoboStac: Illedan - the only thing I've seen is the animations don't play so you get states after seeds have been removed but before they are put back 
 Astrobytes: struct: Amazons: draws are not possible...
 Illedan: Yeah, but I struggle to see the final results RoboStac
 Illedan: Since that last animation wont play
 struct: There are no draws AStro
 RoboStac: yeah, it's the same reason 
 struct: Or are there?
 RoboStac: just drag it and click play&#160;:)
 struct: Unless I have a bug
 Illedan: Doesn't work everytime :P
 Astrobytes: if you need the end then scroll as far as you can then press your right arrow key
 joniebear: I will learn how to do n*n in my language. I will learn about alternative options to do input and output and do calculations. Not all of them would be "better" in general, but I would learn about their existence and how to use them. 
 RoboStac: hmm, in fact that just restarts it - drag it and go forwards/backwards once
 struct: Astrobytes is there a game that ends in a draw?
 Illedan: Oh, the arrows helps in this one. Never used them. thx
 Astrobytes: Otherwise you're left thinking 'why did x win when we both have y score?' then discover they gathered 18 seeds :P
 Astrobytes: struct: don't worry, just me being slow. Forgot about the mirrored game
 struct: I guess amazons will also be a NN battle after a while

 struct: invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina
 Digginwings: how do u win
 ZarthaxX: argentina is always the problem struct , agree
 struct: Digginwings be the last person to move
 struct: so you need to trap your opponent
 Digginwings: how can i be last if i always start first
 BlaiseEbuth: Firsts gonna be the lasts. That's known
 Astrobytes: You run out of places to move to ie. you get blocked in
 Digginwings: ok
 struct: its a hard game
 struct: lots of papers on it though
 Digginwings: ok its pretty good though
 Astrobytes: You want to maximise your available territory and minimise that of your opponents, essentially
 Digginwings: oh so big brain it
 BlaiseEbuth: As a cat you have some tips on that Astrobytes&#160;? :3
 Astrobytes: Of course BlaiseEbuth. Not applicable to Amazons though :P
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I don't think there's a 'pee in the corner' move unfortunately.
 Astrobytes: Hm. New multi idea :thinking:
 Astrobytes: I mean, the move would be called 'mark territory' ofc
 ZarthaxX: AstroBan
 BlaiseEbuth: "What in upcoming leagues? Spray..."

 Trist0214: Quick question, with the activity "There is no Spoon" Im getting an warning saying i didnt read all available input - been doing this since defaultbut i still get it correct and im pretty sure im reading all the infohow can I debug this?Should i try capture and display more inputs than necessary or?
 KiwiTae: Trist0214 if you win anyway it doesnt matter take the badge
 orangesnowfox: You might be outputting to stdout instead of stderr- note that I won't be able to respond further
 Trist0214: hmm, im using c# so normal Console.WriteLine()
 Trist0214: Kiwi, the problem is it works with the example and some of them but im getting weird errors for the rest
 Digginwings: does anyone know javascript
 BlaiseEbuth: Some people do
 Trist0214: nevermind, found my problem for the errors, fixed it and everything worksstill getting that warning but as you suggested ill ignore it
 KelvinAndHubbles: I get that warning on like half to almost all my codes, never really cared that much about it, it wont bite
 Trist0214: ahh first time seeing it 
 KiwiTae: anyway in thereis no spoon u dont need to read input after first turn
 jacek: true programmers dont care about warnings :v
 Trist0214: used to warnings in yellow,i read everything in red xD
 KelvinAndHubbles: true programmers ignore errors
 Trist0214: lmao

 Marchete: will you do it?
 Marchete: I don't think that's for tiny NN
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: most of the time all will change
 Marchete: but I'm not the best to discuss about NN :confused:
 jacek: no, just another nnue explaining with more technics
 Marchete: I was just seeing the base65536, I don't know but charcount is higher than base32768, at least on CG codegolf
 Marchete: and these two are overly complex to my taste
 Marchete: like you need a lot of lookups to encode and decode
 Marchete: about NNUE "With some int16 and int32 sprinkled where necessary. Floating point is not an option for state of the art engines, though it is used by some others."
 Smelty: o.o
 Marchete: now*?
 Marchete: damn
 jacek: im still using floats&#160;:(
 jacek: they use SIMD with int8s int16s because theyre faster
 Marchete: I imagine, I read some about int8 and looked more complex than floats
 struct: storing weights in int8
 struct:&#160;?
 Marchete: quantization
 Marchete: not only storing
 Marchete: but using it for inference/prediction
 jacek: also operating on 32 int8s at a time via avx
 Marchete: btw your JacekMax with heuristics worked pretty well
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: but as I have no **** idea about NN I can't make it any better yet
 Marchete: well I mean 12th-15th range
 Marchete: for me it's good for my heuristic
 Marchete: so I keep it as another search algorithm
 jacek: what was before
 Marchete: a bit lower
 jacek: lower than 12?
 struct: which game?
 Marchete: like 15th-18th
 jacek: thats higher :v
 Marchete: lower in leaderboards
 jacek: before was alphabeta?
 Marchete: high scores == :point_up:
 Marchete: low scores = :point_down:
 Marchete: negamax, yes
 Marchete: TT caching, etc
 Marchete: and I probably had bugs, but overall it seems to work fine
 jacek: jacekmax is eval-type agnostic. it generally works better against 'plain' alpha-beta
 jacek: plain meaning basic move ordering TT etc. no quiescient search, sophisticated pruning or extensions
 jacek: at least in very low time control
 CodingPrograming101: How do I code lol
 Marchete: yes, I find alphabeta more finicky about pruning, ordering, etc..

 RoyDebugger: s
 RoyDebugger: sg
 King_Coda: No gibberish spamming
 VizGhar: readlineSync returns nullable String
 VizGhar: and dart 2.something is null safe
 struct: your warning was too late King_Coda
 struct: You didnt save him this time
 BlaiseEbuth: struct! You banned my bot! :rage:
 King_Coda: Darn, struct. I tried. Perhaps he will learn from his mistake.
 King_Coda: :rofl: BlaiseEbuth
 Therabidpanther: howdy fellas
 King_Coda: Howdy Therabidpanther
 Astrobytes: y no C++ 20
 struct: sorry blaise
 struct: its still not released
 struct: iirc
 Astrobytes: I'm just trolling
 struct: oh it was published in december 2020
 King_Coda: Good morning Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yeah but it's still under-adopted struct
 Therabidpanther: #boycottASCIIArt
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't care about the version number, just hope that the stack trace will be back.
 jacek: heap trace?
 Astrobytes: last RAIC used C++20, they like their bleeding edges
 Astrobytes: Good early evening King_Coda
 King_Coda: whats wrong with ASCII art?
 Westicles: Marchete, how do you use clang?  From bash?
 struct: nope BlaiseEbuth
 struct: its still broken
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: meh
 Astrobytes: Typical
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: I've installed it, and send binaries
 BlaiseEbuth: A major version of g++ is not enough
 Marchete: but in some cases
 Marchete: I find that clang errors are more clear than both g++ and Visual C++
 Westicles: It seems to be faster in some cases as well
 Marchete: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: Will always be clearer than no error msg at all...
 struct: not hard to be faster than msvc
 jacek: make code without errors [solved]
 oechlacite: :joy:
 Marchete: they do give errors, but very cryptic and about some external library
 BlaiseEbuth: That's what i do. But I think to the others....
 Marchete: I code in VS, good IDE
 Westicles: struct, I meant clang++ faster than g++
 Max_Bekh: salut les sauces
 jacek: :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: Stoi la sauce
 Therabidpanther: once i lose my license to intellij, should i go to VS?
 struct: which language?
 Therabidpanther: mainly java
 struct: unless you mean vs code
 Therabidpanther: i do
 struct: vs code is nice
 BlaiseEbuth: Vampire Scythe
 buyyakhoo: visual studio code nice
 Therabidpanther: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paper-soccer">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paper-soccer</a> is this as complicated as i am making it? lol
 struct: ask jacek
 Therabidpanther: @jacek
 struct: I honestly have no idea what search people use there
 Astrobytes: SAme
 Therabidpanther: oh, i didnt even realize jacek contributed it lol
 Hjax: hi everyone 
 struct: hi Hjax
 Astrobytes: goodness me, a wild hjax appears
 jacek: :tada:
 Hjax: i might have started playing league of legends during the last contest 
 Hjax: and then... didnt stop for 6 months
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: Therabidpanther any question?
 Astrobytes: These things happen Hjax
 struct: Which rank did you achieve Hjax?
 Hjax: im silver currently lol 
 Hjax: i can climb to gold at least 
 struct: Nice
 Therabidpanther: just lost where to start jacek lol
 BlaiseEbuth: This cat is more elegant than you Astrobytes
 Illedan: You have to change your bio from SC2 then
 struct: I was around diamond 2 when I quit, I left on season 6 or 7, cant recall
 Hjax: oh thats pretty good 
 Astrobytes: And much older than me too BlaiseEbuth
 Therabidpanther: im thinking of getting started on lol
 struct: if you play support or mid you can get plat
 jacek: and i see reBless is online
 BlaiseEbuth: Na. I don't trust you. He play competitive games.
 jacek: what happened
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Hjax is younger but his cat is older than mines
 Astrobytes: Indeed jacek
 Hjax: yeah my cat is 19 years old 
 Hjax: he was like 16 in that picture though
 BlaiseEbuth: Old cats makes better drones.
 Astrobytes: Serve the hive!
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobee
 Hjax: anyone know what the new contest art is referencing? 
 Astrobytes: Other than 'the new contest' no :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Rototo
 jacek: some weird people say it is made in abyss :unamused:
 struct: I know&#160;:)
 Hjax: lol, i love made in abyss, but it doesnt look like it to me 
 Hjax: the last few contests seemed to reference somewhat obvious pop culture things 
 Hjax: zelda, pacman 
 BlaiseEbuth: Seriously Oo
 BlaiseEbuth: Totoro dude :cry:
 jacek: its not obvious eh
 BlaiseEbuth: It is
 Hjax: oh i never saw that movie, thats why i was asking 
 Hjax: true does look similiar 
 Hjax: ive only seen Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle 
 jacek: me neither though i know it from pictures
 struct: Its yoda from star wars
 jacek: nowadays i know most about anime from memes
 struct: This is why im saying its csb remaster
 Westicles: No reasonable person can deny the artwork was based on this
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5355251/my-neighbor-totoro-aruite-sagaso-totoros-dondoko-g">https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5355251/my-neighbor-totoro-aruite-sagaso-totoros-dondoko-g</a>
 Hjax: jacek i feel like your avatar has rotated like 45 degrees since i was last here 
 Astrobytes: I haven't seen Totoro but I knew the reference, Spirited Away was epic
 jacek: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: And flipped
 struct: Its either Totoro or yoda
 Astrobytes: Yoda :rofl:
 jacek: or mlp
 struct: Well I have no idea what it is then&#160;:/
 BlaiseEbuth: darude sandstorm
 struct: I tried everything
 struct: maybe its another moba?
 Astrobytes: Maybe it's based on Predator but with cuddly little things
 struct: oh no
 struct: botc 2
 struct: :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: A fluffy pcr
 BlaiseEbuth: with fow
 Astrobytes: Naturally.
 struct: 100%
 BlaiseEbuth: BREW TOTORO
 struct: as long as its 3d im happy
 Astrobytes: 3D FOW Totoro racing battles
 Astrobytes: Battles fought using RPS
 Hjax: i see a pretty long discussion on the forums about ai hiding 
 jacek: hm?
 Hjax: imo the simpliest fix would be to let the owner of a bot see games from when they are tested against in IDE 
 Astrobytes: That's a very old thread that had some recent activity after a semi-private contest
 struct: I agree Hjax
 Astrobytes: The RAIC model works
 struct: But its not a permanent solution
 struct: I can test a bot and make it break after a certain hour
 Astrobytes: But people still hide in RAIC
 BlaiseEbuth: The point is cg don't care, so move on.
 Astrobytes: Though it's risky.
 Astrobytes: It doesn't bother me.
 Hjax: what is RAIC / the RAIC model?
 Astrobytes: If it's going to be a thing, it's a thing.
 Astrobytes: Russian AI Cup Hjax
 Hjax: ah, and how do they prevent hiding?
 BlaiseEbuth: KGB..
 Hjax: lol
 struct: you really cant prevent it
 Astrobytes: You can see all your arena matches, all the matches you've tested against whoever, and all the matches where whoever tested against you
 struct: Unless you stop allowing play my code in ide
 Hjax: yeah that seems fair to me
 Astrobytes: But people still hide
 jacek: whats wrong with hiding
 Hjax: if someone wants to test in a vacuum and have no benefits of actually testing against real opponents 
 Hjax: thats on them
 Astrobytes: If the platform allows it then it's fair
 Hjax: they may find their bot isnt as good as they think it is 
 Astrobytes: I always hide, even after the contest :P
 struct: im hiding right now
 jacek: i forget to unhide in contests and end up in bronze
 Astrobytes: My bots are so well hidden even I can't find them
 Scarfield: xD
 Westicles: Seems weird that you can play people in the IDE in the first place.  Just get rid of that option
 jacek: oO
 Illedan: *Only allow to play submitted versions vs others in the IDE
 jacek: :unamused: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/04/29/facebook-joins-rust-foundation/">https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/04/29/facebook-joins-rust-foundation/</a>
 Hjax: the othello leaderboard has grown quite a bit since i last looked 
 Hjax: my rust mcts seems to have held up shockingly well 
 jacek: it was potw in the meantime
 BlaiseEbuth: And so what jacek google was already in
 jacek: perhaps is sustained during books war
 Astrobytes: Now play Amazons
 BlaiseEbuth: MBH
 BlaiseEbuth: to be short
 Hjax: is amazons the newest bot programming game?
 jacek: eeyup
 Hjax: 12 in arena lol 
 struct:&#160;:'(
 struct: I was aiming for 6k players this time
 Astrobytes: It's only 2 days old
 Westicles: tryangle only up to 47
 struct: How much does chess have?
 jacek: 92, before potw it was 50 something
 struct: how many completed the potw?
 jacek: chess move generation is quite complicated
 jacek: dunno, 4-5 new people in wood1?
 struct: Othello still holds the record then
 BlaiseEbuth: Too many multis and multis change into solos...
 Astrobytes: Not a case of too many multis, just no way of ordering/categorisation other than the tags
 BlaiseEbuth: A 5% consideration...
 Astrobytes: 'Board Game', 'Physics', 'Other' at the very least would be helpful
 Illedan: Just create a 3rd party webpage where I can paste my nick/playerId and find all submits the followers in the last week
 Illedan: *from the people I follow
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... "board game" represent something like 98%
 Westicles: Seems like you need legend to get people interested
 jacek: so most community
 struct: Maybe westicles, I dont know how uttt got so many people
 Astrobytes: Westicles: They will only open 'proper leagues' if you get 'unspecified' number of users
 Astrobytes: *players
 BlaiseEbuth: NaN
 Astrobytes: There's valid reasons for either way
 Astrobytes: *arguments
 Astrobytes: jacek: they should have played it on CG perhaps<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/29/draughts-match-nearly-triggers-diplomatic-incident-between-poland-and-russia">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/29/draughts-match-nearly-triggers-diplomatic-incident-between-poland-and-russia</a>
 Chikennugget: hi
 jacek: Astrodraughts CG is 8x8, international draughts is 10s10
 jacek: 10x10 even
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know...
 Astrobytes: It was kind of a joke
 jacek: oh
 Astrobytes: We should have international on here anyway
 jacek: then do it ~
 BlaiseEbuth: nothing is impossible
 BlaiseEbuth: yesterday you said tomorrow
 Westicles: Hmm.  So the East slavs all hate each other, and then the West and East slavs hate each other.  What about the south?
 Secret_sister2: ineed help with the descent coding puzzle
 Secret_sister2: i need*
 jacek: whats the problem
 Hjax: WAIT
 Hjax: THERES CHESS
 Astrobytes: Yes. It's Fischer Random though :P
 Hjax: sorry amazons
 Hjax: i was hoping chess would get added for a whle 
 Hjax: while*
 Astrobytes: It's 960 to keep it interesting and mitigate books
 Hjax: seems reasonable 
 Hjax: oh nice you can force classical with seed, thats nice
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's lots of great options. It's very well made.
 Hjax: not surprised, looking at who made it 
 Astrobytes: Indeed. He did an excellent job on it,
 King_Coda: oh great
 King_Coda: just found out that they're going to have to knock me out when I get my teeth removed
 King_Coda: yaayyyyyy, i just love being unconcious, it's always been my dream to be unconcious yayyyyyy
 Astrobytes: we did say this was likely yesterday
 Hjax: i was awake when i had my wisdom teeth taken out 
 King_Coda: Yeah, well my teeth are still in my jaw
 struct: I thought it was an american thing
 Hjax: most unpleasant sound ive ever heard 
 King_Coda: the roots of my teeth are growing into my sinuses
 Hjax: ow
 King_Coda: so yeah, they kinda HAVE to knock me out
 Astrobytes: This was happening to me too King_Coda. The anaesthetic is worth it for that.
 Astrobytes: And you won't feel half as bad as I did after mine.
 Astrobytes: Anaesthesia is a little better these days.
 King_Coda: I just hate the idea of being unconcious
 Astrobytes: You won't mind. You'll be unconscious :P
 jacek: every night..
 BlaiseEbuth: KO! Finish him... Fatality!
 Hjax: yeah i was about to say, you must hate sleeping
 King_Coda: falling asleep is different
 King_Coda: being knocked out by chemical gas is completely unrelated
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Babality!
 jacek: actually do you really get unciosnous anesthesia at dentist? in here it is only local
 Astrobytes: Oh you get gas still too?
 Astrobytes: They do yeah jacek
 King_Coda: Actually, I think it's an IV now.
 Astrobytes: I had gas, the hangover from it was The Worst
 Hjax: ive only had it through an IV
 Hjax: no real hangover or anything 
 Hjax: felt like i fast traveled honestly 
 Astrobytes: IV anaesthesia is a lot less nasty
 King_Coda: It's not so much the being unconcious, it's the what they're going to do to me while i'm unconcious that scares me
 Hjax: boom im in the next room 
 King_Coda: I hate the idea of not being awake while something is happening to me
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about it.
 Astrobytes: Worry about evil attackers with chloroform, nto your dentist.
 Astrobytes: *not
 King_Coda: Hahaha :rofl:
 King_Coda: Thanks Astrobytes
 jacek: chloroform works really slowly
 Astrobytes: This isn't Floyd The Barber or anything
 jacek: movies make it seem quick, but its not
 King_Coda: Yeah sure, just like fast traveling
 King_Coda: No, it takes about 60 seconds for chloroform to start working
 Astrobytes: There are a number of inhalants that can work a lot faster yes
 <b>**jacek noted</b></p><p><img src="/a/59449061195531" /> BlaiseEbuth: "OK! All sewed up! ... Hmm... Nurse? Have you seen my ring somewhere?"
 Astrobytes: Which... uh... ring
 Hjax: emergency rooms are obsessed with counting things for that reason 
 Hjax: to make sure nothing is forgotten 
 Astrobytes: Not just ER
 BlaiseEbuth: "OK. Everything is fine! But you gonna laugh! I forgot my ring in your sinus! Ahaha!"
 King_Coda: Pffffffff
 Hjax: i can probably reuse some of my othello program for chess 
 Astrobytes: You laugh, my mum got septicaemia from a swab left in her abdomen after an op and almost died. Like literally at death's door.
 Hjax: yikes astro
 King_Coda: damn Astrobytes, thats a yikes
 jacek: othello is quite different fromchess eh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I was only about 13-14 at the time. Was terrible.
 Hjax: it is, but sliding piece attacks in chess are calculated in a similar way to othello captures
 Astrobytes: But these things do happen.
 Astrobytes: You're gonna be just fine tho King_Coda
 Astrobytes: Just gonna have a sore jaw for a bit
 King_Coda: Hah, I can deal with that
 Astrobytes: Depends how you do them Hjax but yeah that's one way
 jacek: i once had lingual nerve injury. at first i felt she missed with injection and injected straight to tongue
 Hjax: i havent touched rust since i did othello
 Hjax: i might be..... rusty
 Hjax: ill escort myself out 
 King_Coda: :expressionless:
 Astrobytes: :P
 BlaiseEbuth: :crab:
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 King_Coda: :rolling_eyes:
 King_Coda: :clap:
 Astrobytes: jacek: have you had the 'under the tongue' local anaesthetic injection?
 jacek: yes
 King_Coda: ouch
 King_Coda: that sounds :head_bandage:
 Astrobytes: For me that was the only thing I found hard to deal with.
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 jacek: afterwards it was numb and constant pain for 3 weeks, that slowly faded within 6 months
 King_Coda: You guys had it rough, i'm just gonna get an iv
 Astrobytes: Thankfully my dental assistant was cute and used to hold my hand throughout it.
 Hjax: lol
 King_Coda: Hahaha, Astrobytes had a crush on his dentist?
 Astrobytes: God no, his assistant
 Hjax: python 3 at rank 8 on chess, higher than the highest rust
 Hjax: that seems backwards 
 jacek: sounds cheesy
 King_Coda: :couplekiss:
 BlaiseEbuth: :cheese:
 Astrobytes: Chess isn't exactly straightforward
 King_Coda: Actually wait, Astrobytes you're a cat right?
 BlaiseEbuth: Go forth and die
 jacek: its only 50ms, at this point you can do some heuristics and be high
 Astrobytes: King_Coda: not irl
 BlaiseEbuth: What!?
 Hjax: i wonder how many nodes stockfish can do in 50 ms 
 Gemer0987: What are yall ncoding
 BlaiseEbuth: You lied to me
 King_Coda: Astrobytes and his dentist assistant: :heart_eyes_cat:
 King_Coda: :heart_eyes:
 King_Coda: :couplekiss:
 Astrobytes: She was hot! What's a young lad to do
 King_Coda: :rofl:
 Lachrymosa: open up, turn your head this way, spit
 jacek: that was anesthesia talking
 Hjax: lies, Astrobytes is definitely a cat

 Astrobytes: Blaise gets it
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not a cat your honor&#160;!
 Lachrymosa: krk
 Lachrymosa: kek even
 King_Coda: Lol Blaise
 Astrobytes: krkr could have worked in this situation Lachrymosa
 Lachrymosa: ㅋㅋㅋ 
 Astrobytes: also hi btw
 Lachrymosa: Hi :3
 King_Coda: hai hru?
 King_Coda: haiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
 King_Coda: hruhruhrurhurhurruhruhruhruhruhurhurhr
 Astrobytes: *hii
 Lachrymosa: greet(*)
 King_Coda: Every time someone types "hii" I always think of the Wii, so in my head I pronounce it "he" not "hi"
 Lachrymosa: Even funnier for Hii U
 Astrobytes: In the UK we always thought the Nintendo Wii was gonna be a toilet simulator
 King_Coda: WHat??
 King_Coda: Hahahahhahaha, toilet simulator? Not the most unorthodox thing I've heard, but certainly not the least
 Lachrymosa: From the makers of Goat Simulator... Toilet Simulator, it's a crap load of fun!
 Hjax: in british english "take a wee" means to urinate 
 Hjax: i think is what astro is getting at 
 Lachrymosa: or an adjective for small if you're a bit more Northern :3
 Astrobytes: Yes
 King_Coda: Oh, clever!
 Astrobytes: to both
 BlaiseEbuth: The wii u is something that can be called a console error.
 Astrobytes: I'm Scottish, wee means small or a pee
 King_Coda: I'm gonna take a wee wee using my wee wee
 Astrobytes: So going for a wee wee
 Lachrymosa: and a small piss is a wee wee, which is what an American child calls their dick :V
 Astrobytes: Yes I know
 King_Coda: *Neurons Activated*
 King_Coda: *Synapses Firing*
 Lachrymosa: Language is wild man...
 King_Coda: *Preparing Response*
 King_Coda: *Processing...*
 King_Coda: lol
 King_Coda: *Process Complete*
 Lachrymosa: My wife's first language is Korean and she forgot the English word for a jacket's hood, so she used the Korean words translated and called it a Jacket Hat. I now call it a jacket hat because its cute :3
 Astrobytes: Hey, it works right?&#160;:)
 jacek: Automaton2000 are you there
 Lachrymosa: felicity is key
 Astrobytes: He died jacek
 King_Coda: Well, a jacket hood is indeed a hat
 Astrobytes: Absolutely Lachrymosa

 jacek: Astrobytes alright, posted in discord
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: I cut the grass in my garden last year and only afterwards did I notice a big snail that rode around on top of the lawnmower the whole time.
 King_Coda: Let us take a moment of sufficiently loud continuous volume to mourn the passing of Manual1000
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 Astrobytes: I called him Adrenaline Snail
 Astrobytes: Presumably he's still in the shed somewhere

 King_Coda: Oh no
 King_Coda: Not that movie. Anything but that.
 jacek:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Have'nt saw it
 King_Coda: Don't.
 Hjax: apparently the rust update broke my othello bot 
 Hjax: it doesnt compile anymore
 BlaiseEbuth: Just remember the snail
 jacek: resubmit then!
 Hjax: lol
 King_Coda: Just Don't. For your own mental health and well being.
 BlaiseEbuth: What mental health?
 Astrobytes: Your health that went mad
 King_Coda: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: 'mental' is a slang UK term for crazy or mad
 Hjax: they changed how many arguments the random range function takes lol
 BlaiseEbuth: gastrobytes
 King_Coda: :grinning::point_up:
 King_Coda: Gastrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yes, GastroBytes has been done due to the cheffing history
 jacek: cheffing history of britain? whats that
 King_Coda: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: cheffing history of AstroBytes
 Hjax: they didnt happen to add a way to compile release in IDE did they
 Astrobytes: Isn't it in release mode?
 King_Coda: Hjax: Perhaps this will help?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-set-debug-and-release-configurations?view=vs-2019">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-set-debug-and-release-configurations?view=vs-2019</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: microsoft docs :rofl:
 Hjax: im using rust King_Coda, codingame builds in debug mode when you play in IDE
 Hjax: which is sloooooow
 struct: not anymore
 struct: its release on ide too
 King_Coda: Ohhhhhhh, I forgot about that little detail
 Astrobytes: ^ is what I thought
 Astrobytes: That and C# now in release mode in IDE
 Hjax: if thats the case, then im very confused why my othello bot has zero rollouts lol 
 jacek: heavy rollouts?
 Astrobytes: When was your last contest Hjax?
 struct: maybe it changed with langauge update?
 Hjax: no, very light rollouts 
 Hjax: uh, i looked at the fall challenge briefly, and then got distracted and didnt give much of an attempt 
 Astrobytes: So your last proper one was PacMan?
 Hjax: yeah
 jacek: Automaton2000 still dead?
 Automaton2000: antisquid are you in a while
 jacek: :c
 jacek: c:
 Astrobytes: Hm, when was the update struct?
 jacek: AutomatonNN what about the frog
 struct: Debugging enabled
 struct: ffs
 Hjax: now i get 10k
 Hjax: so something is different lol 
 Astrobytes: Wait what - they *reintroduced* debug mode in Rust?
 struct: ok its on debug mode again
 Hjax: LOL
 struct: on ide and release on arena
 struct: I just tested
 Astrobytes: FFS :rofl:
 Hjax: AND RELEASE?
 struct: on ide is debug
 Hjax: oh
 Hjax: im blind 
 struct: sorry
 struct: on arena is release
 Hjax: ic
 Hjax: ok ill submit and see if it works lol 
 Astrobytes: wtf, they have to fix that, discord it struct
 Westicles: I wonder if lots of bots broke
 struct: I posted on bug-report
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/541122022">https://www.codingame.com/replay/541122022</a>
 King_Coda: Go struct, I summon you to fulfill your oath.
 Hjax: i need to resubmit anyway, dont want my bot instantly losing every game lol
 King_Coda: it's 3 minutes to 12 and I know I should eat lunch, however I woke up very hungry this morning so I ate a big breaky. But now I'm not that hungry for lunch.
 struct: at least C# seems to be on release mode
 Lachrymosa: Banana!
 Hjax: so they unfixed it when they updated? 
 Hjax: i guess?
 struct: I think so
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: Hey - at least it's Thursday!
 Astrobytes: And not the day of the contest or the weekend
 Hjax: guess im glad i came here a week before the contest lol
 Astrobytes: Right!
 King_Coda: I guess I'll just force myself to eat.
 King_Coda: Anyways, when is the next contest (after the spring one)
 Astrobytes: Fall.
 Lachrymosa: I'm excited for this competition :3
 King_Coda: I should have learned everything I need by the time fall rolls around.
 Astrobytes: Pass me that sht Lachrymosa
 Lachrymosa: My goal is to get into high silver, that would be a personal best since pod racing
 Astrobytes: I'm trying to get excited but I can't.
 Hjax: i think ive finally learned not to be excited 
 Astrobytes: I'll either get excited when I see it or I won't.
 Lachrymosa: I don't actually code for a living though, just SIEM definitions and queries
 Hjax: pac man made me sad, potion game wasnt very interesting to me 
 Astrobytes: I don't code for a living either Lachrymosa
 Lachrymosa: I wanted to be better at potion game but I've never successfully done simulation/board state evaluation
 Lachrymosa: Astrobytes what do you do then? You're so good :V
 Astrobytes: Start with a simple game like straight up TTT, not ultimate, and build on that
 Astrobytes: Lachrymosa: Pharmaceutical regulatory affairs
 Astrobytes: Biology BSc, cell biology MSc
 Lachrymosa: neat :3
 Astrobytes: I'm winding it down, the particular area I work in is almost dead due to Brexit.
 Hjax: i think the king of "i dont code for a living" here is smits 
 Astrobytes: Was thinking of trying to get into software testing
 Hjax: he makes quite a few people who do code for a living (like me) look like complete amateurs 
 Astrobytes: No, Smits is now a qualified CS teacher
 jacek: hes just old boomer
 jacek: booker*
 ShannonNorris97: Has anyone done the mountain map puzzle? I've finished it and its printing the right answers, but when I test it it says found: nothing
 jacek: the descent?
 ShannonNorris97: No, it's literally just called mountain map
 Hjax: thats still "teaches for a living" rather than "codes for a living"
 ShannonNorris97: It's a community one
 Westicles: Shannon, you probably have an unneeded newline at the end
 jacek: Hjax you mean "If You Don't Know It,Teach It!"?
 Astrobytes: It's a little more 'in the arena' though Hjax :D
 Hjax: thats fair
 King_Coda: I would like to code for a living. Being a game dev sounds awesome.
 ShannonNorris97: yeah I thought the same Westicles, but when I print it using repr to show the newlines there aren't any
 jacek: it says found Nothing or expected Nothing?
 Hjax: game dev is a hard job to get
 ShannonNorris97: found: nothing
 UnnamedCodinGamer: King_Coda it seems that it is quite a dirty job, judging by reports from others 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: basically everyone wants to be a game dev and the companies take advantage of you
 Lachrymosa: Would someone be willing to assist me with my "OH DUH" moment in "Dwarfs Standing on the Shoulders of Giants" puzzle?
 ShannonNorris97: I  got it now, it didn't like me printing it by looping through the array, even though it printed in the exact same way. So I just changed it to formulate it all into one string
 UnnamedCodinGamer: crushing working hours enc.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: etc.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: btw, solved search race offline only to find out that my "code size" is too large 
 King_Coda: ehhh
 King_Coda: sounds fine to me
 UnnamedCodinGamer: inform yourself if you need to make a decision
 vocuzi: Hi there guys!
 vocuzi: I am new here
 King_Coda: indeed
 Hjax: hello vocuzi, welcome
 King_Coda: get a pfp
 Lachrymosa: Welcome!
 vocuzi: Got here after watching a clash of code vid on youtube 
 Lachrymosa: Neat, just in time for the contest next week too!
 vocuzi: Woohoo
 vocuzi: How do I get an invite for it&#160;?
 Hjax: just click on the contest on the homepage and hit join 
 Lachrymosa: You just go to the top of the main page, click compete, and sign up. It's free!
 King_Coda: I deleted my invite email
 jacek: oO
 Lachrymosa: I'm not sure if CG is still giving out shirts for top prizes or not, but its never mattered much to me :p I won't be getting top prize this decade lol
 King_Coda: ...because i'm not participating during spring
 King_Coda: i'll be doing the fall one this year
 vocuzi: Is the Spring challenge 2021, the one you talking about&#160;?
 Hjax: thats the one
 jacek: yes
 King_Coda: no
 King_Coda: definitely not
 Lachrymosa: The spring one is the one next week, the fall one has not yet been announced
 vocuzi: aight 
 Lachrymosa: King_Coda is being cantankerous 
 vocuzi: you guys are uni students or what&#160;?
 King_Coda: indeed
 WannaBeHum1n: tips on how to get  out of gold in coders strike back pls&#160;?
 Lachrymosa: Various backgrounds, some public, some private
 Hjax: i graduated a few years ago, software engineer now
 Hjax: theres people who do all sorts of things here 
 vocuzi: I am in my final year of grad
 Lachrymosa: grats ^_^
 King_Coda: i love being cantankerous to new people
 vocuzi: lol
 King_Coda: welcome to the fmily vocuzi
 vocuzi: it's cool as long as there are the cooperative ones
 Lachrymosa: such a curmudgeonly fellow v.v
 King_Coda: *family
 vocuzi: Thank you king coda
 Uljahn: also take a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a> to get the idea of contests in general, because they differ from clashes
 Lachrymosa: ^
 Uljahn: woah chat freezed
 vocuzi: Thanks for the link, I will check it out 
 King_Coda: Chat is acting weird today
 Uljahn: *froze
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's been slow today
 King_Coda: It posted 2 messages 3 minutes after i entered them in
 Astrobytes: Also: King_Coda, still do this contest, just don't beat yourself up about not getting to x y or z position. Just do it
 King_Coda: Are you sure? I'm still just learning Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: The best way is to just jump in and try it
 Astrobytes: Of course
 Lachrymosa: *insert shia labeouf*
 King_Coda: okay, if you say so
 King_Coda: Just do it!
 Hjax: oh yeah best way to learn is to try the contest out and do your best
 Hjax: youll learn a lot along the way 
 Astrobytes: ^^^^^
 King_Coda: time to go diggin through my trash
 Hjax: plus there will be plenty of people in chat to give you advice 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: if you learn a few algorithms beforehand it might help
 Astrobytes: Or advice you can pick up just by reading
 Lachrymosa: lurkm0ar
 Hjax: yeah people arent usually super tight lipped about ideas and strategies 
 King_Coda: It takes place exactly one day after my birthday
 Hjax: so youll see plenty floating around 
 Lachrymosa: Just ask Maddy anything about coder's strike back and you'll get the tip that will take you into gold ez
 King_Coda: MadKnight?
 Uljahn: or search the forum
 WannaBeHum1n: i need the tip
 WannaBeHum1n: out of gold
 WannaBeHum1n: pls
 WannaBeHum1n: xD
 Lachrymosa: yea lol, I just try not to summon him :3 lest he ask me what I am working on, and why it isn't the things he wants me to work on lol
 King_Coda: Oh, MadKnight. What will we do with him.
 Lachrymosa: Don't say it three times! It's like Beetlejuise
 Astrobytes: Out of gold WannaBeHum1n? Write a reasonably accurate simulation of the game and use a search algorithm or use maths + physics.
 Uljahn: two runners + simple simulation without collisions is enough i think
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think that's accurate
 Lachrymosa: what variances do you throw in? Like you can't try all thrust values from 0-100 or every angle around the circle? How do you decide where the limits are?
 Astrobytes: At least top 50% legend
 Astrobytes: Depends on your algorithm/heuristics Lachrymosa
 Astrobytes: Sometimes you want to discretize, sometimes you want to keep it continuous
 Astrobytes: Minimax approaches to CSB for instance, you limit angles to -18, 0, 18, thrust to 0, 200 plus boost (or variations thereof)
 King_Coda: I'm going to try and get 25,000 reputation on stackoverflow.com
 Astrobytes: With something like a GA, it's going to be a smoother approach
 WannaBeHum1n: can i get a name of a search algorithm
 Uljahn: smitsimax
 Hjax: A*
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=search+algorithm">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=search+algorithm</a>
 Lachrymosa:  kek
 Astrobytes: And read carefully
 King_Coda: Astrobytes getting a little cantankerous
 WannaBeHum1n: the thing is
 WannaBeHum1n: google
 WannaBeHum1n: gives u a ton of them
 Wendys: well
 WannaBeHum1n: and u dont even
 Wendys: you wanted the name of one
 WannaBeHum1n: know 
 Astrobytes: Not cantankerous at all
 Wendys: so i don't see the problem
 WannaBeHum1n: the slightest idea
 WannaBeHum1n: about them
 WannaBeHum1n: which one
 Wendys: you can google the algo name after
 Wendys: smh
 WannaBeHum1n: do u pick
 WannaBeHum1n: to learn 
 WannaBeHum1n: about
 Wendys: that's a u problem
 Uljahn: learn them all, their number is finite
 WannaBeHum1n: well i was thinking maybe someone would give me an advice
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=search+algorithms+for+games">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=search+algorithms+for+games</a>
 WannaBeHum1n: or where to start
 WannaBeHum1n: or smth
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx
 WannaBeHum1n: a lot
 Astrobytes: No really, for the questions you asked, just google those terms
 UnnamedCodinGamer: WannaBeHum1n, maybe a better approach for you might be to see what others have used and then google if needed
 Astrobytes: I gave you a great hint with the latter if you want to do multis, but I'd strongly recommend checking out the former in some detail. 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: when you get a bit of experience you will know which algorithmic direction to go for the specific task
 Astrobytes: ^
 Wendys: clash of code is nice
 jacek: huh
 Wendys: y e s
 struct: oh didnt notice dbd r was first on othello
 Illedan: Optimization game in packing the opening book? :P
 struct: nah, its still his old bot
 struct: He got pushed
 Hjax: i never figured out why my best heuristic for othello was the most simple one
 Hjax: my only eval is mobility, adding any other terms without fail made it worse
 struct: no idea, I didnt even play the game
 jacek: i recently submtted multiple times and pushed dbdr
 jacek: he was lower in the rank because of the book wars
 Astrobytes: ^
 Hjax: probably a consequence of my depth 1 rollouts somehow
 jacek: his bot is objectively the best
 Astrobytes: oldjohn vs msmits
 Astrobytes: I think oldjohn said his bot was the best naturally playing bot
 Astrobytes: ie. non-booked
 jacek: then why doesnt he prove it :f
 Astrobytes: said dbdr's bot was
 struct: he means dbdr was 
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: ahh
 jacek: stupid english
 jacek: i wonder how ai would interpret that sentence and context
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I know
 jacek: Automaton2000 any hint?
 Automaton2000: not sure what that means
 jacek: exactly
 Astrobytes: Even it doesn't get it
 KING_OF_CODING: i need help
 Astrobytes: Cal lthe emergency services.
 Astrobytes: *call the
 VizGhar: or plumber
 VizGhar: or if you need our help, simply ask
 wemat: what is the purpose of this chat?
 jacek: to spam
 wemat: :grin:
 VizGhar: some are more successful then the other&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: If you want the whole statement (ie. if anything changes between wood levels and bronze) just hang around in chat for the first hour of the contest
 Astrobytes: If the repo isn't already up that is
 struct: i will understand the statement in less than a min
 jacek: who reads the statement these days
 Astrobytes: 5%
 Astrobytes: Or 8 out of 10 cats, can't remember
 Hjax: now i hear jimmy carr laughing in my head
 RicardoJKA: Hello Guys I am a new cod in member and what are some advice you can give me to get better at programing. # bigginer
 Astrobytes: AH HAW HAW HAW
 Hjax: the man has quite the unique laugh
 Astrobytes: That he does
 RicardoJKA: :poop:
 jacek: do easy puzzles
 KING_OF_CODING: need help

 KING_OF_CODING: need help
 King_Coda:&#160;?
 UUolfo: Oh god Astrobytes is a mod? We're all doomed.
 King_Coda: Astrobytes has been a mod for a fat minute
 King_Coda: Well, today has been a rather unproductive day
 UUolfo: Right, I can see he earned it based on the helpful advice he gives people (not including this guy)
 UUolfo: fair, fair.
 Hjax:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Oh, is this another banned account jumping into chat under another name
 UUolfo: ^ Fair, don't ban me please dad.
 King_Coda: How could you tell?
 UUolfo: Wait, me? naaaaaa just saying you destoryed that kid with your laugh lol
 UUolfo: he seemed so young, or at least was a baby programmer
 Astrobytes: The AH HAW HAW HAW was in response to Hjax' Jimmy Carr comment.
 King_Coda: ^
 UUolfo: ^ fair, i'm an idiot, didn't read prior context
 UUolfo: I'm sure you're great astro &lt;3
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 Scarfield: xD
 King_Coda: :no_mouth:
 Scarfield: if you feel doomed UUolfo, wait till you meet blaiseButh
 Astrobytes: Hellfield
 Scarfield: purgatoryBytes

 UUolfo: Are these all mods? or just the rough ones?
 struct: yes, I never banned anyone
 Astrobytes: Pardon me?
 Scarfield: dumb nicknames we give eachother
 Astrobytes: Scardante

 King_Coda: AstroShites
 Smelty: AstroField
 Astrobytes: AstroTights? 
 Astrobytes: And that's Shytes btw
 King_Coda: It's a new product line i'm making
 Scarfield: wow new nickname buffoons xD nice
 Astrobytes: Yeah but they lack context
 Scarfield: AstroField is quite nice though
 struct: Java has some weird syntax
 Astrobytes: That was done months ago
 Scarfield: java, or astrofield?
 Scarfield: xD
 struct: 0b1111 then they have 0B1111 and then also have 0B1111L
 struct: wtf is this
 struct: Who created this
 Astrobytes: DO NOT attempt bitwise manipulation in Java unless it's your first time manipulating bits
 struct: im porting amazons to bits
 Scarfield: i hope they are all the same, but 0B1111L is a long?
 Astrobytes: In fking Java?
 struct: yes
 struct: ultra fast referee
 Astrobytes: People were actually kidding about the referee speed
 Astrobytes: The referee speed doesn't matter much unless we're talking graphical modules etc
 Astrobytes: afaik
 King_Coda: He can code, he wears tights
 King_Coda: but most importantly
 King_Coda: he AstroFights
 Scarfield: could hardly be slow enough to have a noticable impact? unless the referee sorts valid moves with a search
 Astrobytes: Men In Tights reference eh
 struct: I do string comparison to check if move is legal&#160;:)
 King_Coda: What? Come on, I took 62 seconds to make that joke!
 Astrobytes: I suspected from the first mention of tights 
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: Can someone help me with a Python question? 
 Scarfield: ask away, dont ask to ask
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 King_Coda: AstroRuinsMyJokes
 King_Coda: :angry:
 Astrobytes: Robin Hood Robin Hood grindring through the glen, Robin Hood Robin Hood with his band of men
 Roxxx: @struct what do you mean weird syntax
 King_Coda: Astrobytes should start a cooking channel called AstroBites
 struct: Roxxx its just a bit strange coming from c++
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: When manipulating user input like - 12345 - to add dashes inbetween chars like - 1-2-3-4-5,  I know that we can run something like: 
 struct: Like Vector with uppercase and stuff like that
 King_Coda: I'm sure there's a Scottish Food Niche on youtube you could get into
 Roxxx: @struct oh ok that's understandable, don't use Vectors in java tho, they are legacy stuff
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: However, the output becomes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/988dc791-f80b-4709-b78f-22e05d0c2205">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/988dc791-f80b-4709-b78f-22e05d0c2205</a>
 Astrobytes: I don't generally partake of Scottish food King_Coda
 King_Coda: Darn. I tried guys.
 Scarfield: xxk1ng0fh3artzxx my_str = my_str[:-1]
 Scarfield: this will remove the last char in the string
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: Do I place that before or after the print() function? 
 Scarfield: basicly, from start to (end - 1)
 Scarfield: print(my_str[:-1])
 Scarfield: should work fine
 Scarfield: or place it before printing, since you want to print the string AFTER removing
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: So something like: 
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: Would placing it before remove the last digit and just place the dash at the end?
 Scarfield: hmm never tried the ulnp, but you want to remove the last "-" after the ulnp call
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: Ok, I'll test it out. Thank you so much!
 King_Coda: ...Does he know that <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">https://www.stackoverflow.com</a> exists?
 Scarfield: that could be phrased a lot nicer.. we all started somewhere
 Scarfield: and np xxk1ng0fh3artzxx&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Remember King_Coda: relevant and specific questions get answers
 Scarfield: ^
 King_Coda: Well... yeah.
 Astrobytes: Otherwise they're directed elsewhere
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: Thank you for the help as well, King_Coda.&#160;:) 
 King_Coda: :flushed: Th-thank you xxk1ng0fh3artzxx
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: I'm brand new at this, so any help and advice is welcome. 
 King_Coda: Of course. We've got a lot of people here willing to help :nerd:

 Japhy2112: Hi all, does anyone use a source control plug-in for the online editor? I just lost some meh code and it angers me.
 struct: I usually just code localy and then use cg sync to send it to the ide
 harelref: yo
 harelref: what's going on
 harelref: I'm looking for a hacker
 Japhy2112: or if I could code in my local IDE and then somehow synch....
 Japhy2112: lulz... imma check cg synch!

 Japhy2112: tyvm
 Japhy2112: I was timing out in the weekly puzzle until I got rid of RegeX
 Japhy2112: At keast timing out on the last test
 Japhy2112: *least

 Roxxx: @Japhy2112 how are you keeping track of occurences,
 Roxxx: i made custom Pair class
 Roxxx: and then put them in a list
 Roxxx: actually Map&lt;String, List&lt;Pair&gt;&gt;
 Roxxx: now when i'm checking for duplicates by comparing index i keep timing out
 Dhill2300: im stuck at Power of Thor - Episode 1
 Japhy2112: Roxxx, sent you a PM
 Uljahn: Dhill2300: but it's impossible with all those hints on the left
 Roxxx: Dhill2300 Power of Thor is literally 10 lines of code, would not be any fun with the hints trust me
 codiaywdga: coders strike back is not easy on ai it is not easy
 hyphz: Now how the heck peopel have golfed Power of Thor is another matter

 j-cg: For the "Coders Strike Back" challenge, I am stuck on the section where they add collision between pods. Can anyone guide me towards a solution?
 struct: is that bronze league?
 j-cg: yep
 struct: The easy way is to print nextcheckpointX - 3 * velocityX
 struct: same for y
 struct: and always go 100 thrust
 struct: A way that requires a bit more coding would be to store the checkpoints after the first time you pass them
 struct: And start turning to them when you are close enough to the next
 j-cg: Ahhh, cool, I'll give that a shot. Thank you.

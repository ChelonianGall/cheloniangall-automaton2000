 AJamal31: the leaderboard on the compete section and the rankings on the person's profile
 BlaiseEbuth: The ranking on the profile correspond to the global leaderboard.
 AJamal31: so what does the leaderboard on the compete sectino mean?
 BlaiseEbuth: My bad. I said 'global' instead of 'general'.The ranking on the profile correspond to the 'general' leaderboard in the compete section.
 AJamal31: lol i'm still confused
 AJamal31: i literally found out about this site today
 BlaiseEbuth: No problem. What don't you understand&#160;?
 AJamal31: When I go to the compete tab, my rank says 3000 something but on my profile it's like 400,000... I don't understand the difference
 AJamal31: like who am I being compared to in the 2 different rankings
 BlaiseEbuth: You're looking to the Clash of Code leaderboard.
 BlaiseEbuth: At the top of the leadeboard page there are tabs, you have to click on the first one, 'general' to see what is displayed on your profile.

 AJamal31: oooo i see
 AJamal31: thanks!
 AJamal31: general is combination of everything and clash of code leaderboard is only for clash of code... makes sense
 BlaiseEbuth: AJamal31, if you want details, click on the '?' beside your rank on your profile.

 kobebryant: working
 BlaiseEbuth: Working. :older_man:
 AJamal31: Okay so does practicing here help with coding interviews?
 AJamal31: These questions int he "Clash of Code" seem much easier than like LeetCode questions
 AJamal31: in the*
 BlaiseEbuth: Clashs aren't representative.
 AJamal31: what do you mean?
 kobebryant:  u people are crzy
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks kobebryant
 BlaiseEbuth: AJamal31 I thought you spoke of CodinGame tests. Well, anything that make you practicing is good to take.

 eulerscheZahl: i guess i'll never reach that achievement. just like "invite 20 users"
 eulerscheZahl: they are French...
 Astrobytes: Sure. But examinator sounds like a character that Arnold Schwarzenegger might play
 eulerscheZahl: to me it sounds like someone who passes all exams in a badass way
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I reported it anyway
 eulerscheZahl: found your report
 Astrobytes: I refrained from pinging you
 BlaiseEbuth: Examinator III: He's back, again.
 Astrobytes: :D
 jrke: how can i convert base64 encoded  bytes or string to int?

 eulerscheZahl: i gave some downvotes for identical solutions in the past (stealing the creator's code). maybe it updates when i solve a puzzle

 martinpapa69: any idea why my clang consume 10gb of ram, when a compile a codingame-sized project&#160;?
 struct: memory leak?
 eulerscheZahl: some nested defines that blow up the code size?
 martinpapa69: i mean, the compiler consomes the ram during copiling
 eulerscheZahl: did you try another compiler?
 martinpapa69: nah
 martinpapa69: ye mbe i should
 reCurse: That doesn't sound right at all
 reCurse: Using clang all the time with no such issues
 martinpapa69: maybe some compatibity issues with  linux subsytem
 lets_think: line
 jacek:  
 Eagermoney: so Ive been trying to learn code from scratch rn and I can figure out how to end a code and start a new one you guys have any idea how to do that?
 StepBack13: lol, depends on what language?
 BlaiseEbuth: Usualy, I do ctrl+s, ctrl+f4 and ctrl+n. That's all
 RoboStac: martinpapa69 - I used to have that problem, the old version of clang on the default wsl distribution is very memory hungry
 jacek: was it made in java?
 martinpapa69: ye, it works fine with clang12. thx!
 reCurse: Huh, TIL. I always updated before using.
 jacek: huh, at work i never update during deadline
 reCurse: *using for the first time...
 jacek: if using for the first time, then its not update
 reCurse: Not sure if you're trolling.
 struct: its jacek
 reCurse: In case you're not, after installing wsl2 I update compilers and other packages

 eulerscheZahl: last was the planets game. but i didn't play until the end
 Astrobytes: that's what I was thinking of
 eulerscheZahl: that was a new game
 Astrobytes: true
 eulerscheZahl: those 90% existing games are boring
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't worry, no more of those!
 Astrobytes: indeed
 BlaiseEbuth: No more sdk!
 BlaiseEbuth: And only escape contest!
 BlaiseEbuth: \o/
 Astrobytes: No more SDK? Who said that?
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK still exists
 BlaiseEbuth: For now...
 eulerscheZahl: sounds highly unlikely to me that they will cancel support for a working system
 Astrobytes: I could see them no longer updating it at some point
 struct: I have 3 options, to port arimaa, paritipate in this challenge or to try breakthrough again and probably go insane 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't expect much improvements/extensions. but still continued support
 struct: Doesnt need improvements tbh
 eulerscheZahl: you are insane already
 struct: all we need is to create own modules
 struct: probably
 BlaiseEbuth: Why maintain it if they don't use it for business
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK even got a recent update (pixi.js version)
 eulerscheZahl: it's still working. and i don't think it needs a lot of maintenance
 eulerscheZahl: unless they decide to update java one day? :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the point

 struct: do you still lose magic though?
 Astrobytes: not 100% on that struct
 struct: vs uses msvc, codingame uses gcc

 Mohammad_Moein: not an error that function returns me just 45 deg for every x , y
 Astrobytes: atan2?
 Mohammad_Moein: arctan(y/x)
 Wontonimo: hmm, something tells me you should try atan2.
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: atan2(y,x)
 Wontonimo: :D
 Mohammad_Moein: i'll try it

 MSmits: in this case it would be 3 pronged
 Astrobytes: multi-pronged
 MSmits: yes many prongs
 MSmits: whats a prong?
 Astrobytes: think of the bits on the business-end of a fork
 MSmits: ah yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prawn *
 Astrobytes: prong *
 MSmits: :shrimp:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, new name for a game search
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: Wingardium!! :D
 Astrobytes: hey prakash, how you doing man?
 cegprakash: good :D I just edited my fantastic bits bot and submitted for wingardium :D 
 Astrobytes: Didn't we all :D
 Marchete: maybe you don't have graphs
 cegprakash: hope to get some XP :P
 Marchete: but you do need to floodfill
 struct: Dont think this game gives XP
 Marchete: check "graph" types, etc
 Astrobytes: No XP for this no
 Astrobytes: 1 league
 cegprakash: Looks like no Accio in this version
 Astrobytes: there is only Wingardium
 cegprakash: Wingardium may be little OP compared to Wingardium
 cegprakash: compared to Filipendo*
 Astrobytes: there's no flipendo either so don't worry about it

 reCurse: Still there MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: whats up reCurse
 reCurse: Just wondered something about mcts solver
 MSmits: ok
 reCurse: How to get out of the fact that when a draw is found it never explores anything else if for some reason all other moves are seen as bad by both sides
 reCurse: I'm a bit puzzled rn
 MSmits: there's several ways to deal with it
 MSmits: I can tell you how i do it sometimes
 MSmits: ok so the idea is you have 1 child node solved as draw and the others are probably solved as loss right?
 MSmits: meaning they bring up the value of the parent node, because they keep losing?
 MSmits: or is this not your problem?
 reCurse: No they are barely explored because the initial value is below 0
 reCurse: 0 = draw
 reCurse: And it keeps selecting the solved draw because it's better than losing
 MSmits: do you mean initial value from policy?
 reCurse: Which is good in theory but then the exploration is lost
 reCurse: No it could just be initial values from low exploration
 MSmits: ohh, well first of all stop selecting the solved draw
 MSmits: thats a waste
 reCurse: Yeah that's the obvious part
 reCurse: However
 MSmits: allright, but you want to prevent bias yes?
 reCurse: What if it *is* the best way
 reCurse: Because of zugzwang situation for example
 reCurse: Then it's better to force the draw and you want to reflect that and not all the other crap
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 32nd with move and throw, not fancy ... wth, anyone trying?
 MSmits: ok, so what you do is, you fix it on backpropagation
 MSmits: one of those bad nodes will be selected
 MSmits: and some bad result will be backpropagated
 MSmits: what you do is, you dont let it get past the solved draw
 MSmits: so you up it to 0 when you get there
 MSmits: but only as long as the bad node has a value lower than 0
 reCurse: But then you have the same problem up in the parents
 reCurse: It keeps selecting the 0 node
 reCurse: When it's not proven because other moves are not selected
 reCurse: Or can't be proven anyway
 Astrobytes: Good time to post your SolverPropagation(int result)&#160;?
 MSmits: nah, i dont have a good example for this, i do this in my meta mcts
 NinjaDoggy: that's not an issue is it reCurse?
 MSmits: for oware
 NinjaDoggy: the parent parent of the draw node should keep selecting the 0 value if other nodes are worse
 MSmits: yeah i dont see the problem of selecting draws when they are obviously better
 MSmits: at least until they are solved
 reCurse: Yeah but the problem is the other nodes may not actually be so bad if you'd select them more
 Astrobytes: The key being that the rest are solved
 MSmits: you just have to prevent the bias from loss siblings
 MSmits: reCurse but isnt that an eval question, why would the NN think they are bad?
 reCurse: The jump from eval to solved is so massive it completely messes up the selection
 reCurse: Because NNs aren't perfect
 MSmits: ohh ok, so the NN doesnt have an eval thats centered around 0, is this the problem?
 reCurse: They can still have wrong intuition only corrected by further search
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: It thinks the position is really bad but it may turn out to be not so bad
 reCurse: But with 10 visits or so it's hard to tell
 reCurse: And then it finds the draw too early
 reCurse: And zeroes in (hoho)
 reCurse: When in fact there was an obscure checkmate
 NinjaDoggy: ok so if I understand this correctly basically at some node
 NinjaDoggy: all the child nodes are supposed to be close to 0 in value
 NinjaDoggy: but the NN outputs negative
 NinjaDoggy: so then when one of them is solved for draw
 NinjaDoggy: it will keep selecting that one
 reCurse: Yes
 Astrobytes: that's how I read it yeah
 MSmits: well as i said, stop that at least
 reCurse: But with more forced visits on the siblings
 reCurse: The initial negative value is actually turning out to be positive
 reCurse: But it never gets to explore
 reCurse: Or if you want a different perspective
 NinjaDoggy: doesn't this issue go away with more training?
 reCurse: Let's say you're ahead in material
 reCurse: You feel good
 reCurse: But oh no there's a forced tactic in 4 moves you didn't see and now you lose
 reCurse: All your evals will still return massive positive until more search is done
 reCurse: So same with the other way around
 reCurse: But draws make it entirely stop looking into bad moves
 MSmits: but that kinda make sense
 reCurse: You can't expect a NN to never be wrong
 MSmits: from the NN perspective anyway
 reCurse: That's why you back it up with a search otherwise you wouldn't bother
 MSmits: of course
 NinjaDoggy: increase exploration constant then?
 reCurse: But the jump is massive
 MSmits: lowers depth and might not let him get past the depth 4 thing
 reCurse: So now it finds that draw sequence because both sides don't feel good about their position for some reason
 MSmits: I'm not sure this is a mcts solver issue though. I mean it would also happen with an unsolved node that has a "draw like"  eval
 reCurse: And it wastes the entire remainder of the search constantly selecting that path
 reCurse: Sure but you can expect your own eval to be smooth
 reCurse: The terminal can cause a massive break in the smoothness
 MSmits: yes that's true
 Astrobytes: is this backproping the solve too early? Before checking the sibling nodes?
 reCurse: No it's not backproping the solve
 reCurse: It's backproping the 0 value tho
 reCurse: And that's messing up with the average score very quickly
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 MSmits: oh you can backprop solves though
 reCurse: Yeah I do that too
 MSmits: even using some form of ab pruning
 reCurse: But it never gets to solve anything else anyway because it keeps selecting the draw
 MSmits: lemme make my ab pruning for draws picture again, who knows, maybe it;s worth it for nn
 NinjaDoggy: don't think it will resolve the issue here
 NinjaDoggy: I still think this shouldn't be an issue with improved NN weights
 reCurse: Just imagine you're in a losing position
 reCurse: But you find a perpetual check
 reCurse: But these kind of situations don't happen enough for the NN to bother learning it
 reCurse: Makes sense?
 NinjaDoggy: ok nvm yea I see
 reCurse: Now for a perpetual that behavior is actually desirable
 reCurse: So not so good example
 reCurse: But say you find a draw by repetition
 reCurse: Then it may or may not be valid
 NinjaDoggy: except it would keep selecting the perpetual
 NinjaDoggy: and not look for other lines that COULD win
 NinjaDoggy: at all
 reCurse: That is definitely another issue yeah
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/gRmm2No">https://imgur.com/a/gRmm2No</a>  
 MSmits: in case it helps
 MSmits: most people dont know this about mcts solver
 reCurse: The problem is the terminal value can be so different from the eval it's messing things up
 Astrobytes: No it's a fine example tbh if you just conjecture other situations with it
 reCurse: For wins and losses it's fine
 reCurse: Draws however...
 struct: is this similar to what you are getting reCurse
 struct: "PUCT algorithm from AlphaZero needsan unpractical amount of simulations to revisit optimal ac-tions where the value evaluations of the first visits are mis-leading"
 reCurse: That's a similar issue but not quite
 MSmits: I think us non-NN users run into this problem a lot less. We get so many sims and much depth so it evens out a bit
 struct: ah, ok i was just reading how a0 implemented it
 struct: this was the paper
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11045v1.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11045v1.pdf</a>
 Astrobytes: Don't you counter that sometimes though MSmits? Sure I saw you talking about it before
 reCurse: You could definitely have the same issue
 reCurse: Without NN
 reCurse: Say you're down material
 reCurse: Your eval is negative
 reCurse: You find a draw by repetition
 reCurse: You zero in on that
 reCurse: But there's actually a forced checkmate
 reCurse: You'll never find it
 struct: ah re curse they mention
 struct: that they handle three fold diferent
 struct: on solver
 Astrobytes: well, not with just one search
 MSmits: allright, you're correct. I think the reason we don't encounter it is that we mostly play games with no early-draws
 reCurse: Chess is also very particular on that
 MSmits: so draws are always last to solve
 NinjaDoggy: yea I mean this is why Alpha Beta is in general so much stronger than MCTS for chess right
 Astrobytes: this is why there are multiple search types and depths used at various stages
 MSmits: those "fill-up the board" games solve draws very late (like uttt, yavalath connect 4 etc.)
 struct: and no draws for repetition there
 MSmits: right
 struct: which is a completely diferent thing
 Astrobytes: NinjaDoggy yeah
 MSmits: Astrobytes what we usually talk about is the bias from not selecting a solved draw and instead selecting bad nodes, making the solved draw look bad too
 MSmits: if you dont correct for it in backprop
 Astrobytes: 960 alphabeta variations for every step in a chess engine :P
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: I need to propagate some information up the tree the draw exists
 reCurse: And stop selecting it
 reCurse: But remember it enough that if nothing better is found at the end
 reCurse: Then consider it
 reCurse: I have trouble formulating the algo though
 MSmits: challenge is to code that without being disgusted :P
 Astrobytes: MSmits right yeah, The backprop is important. That's why I suggested your solver backprop code
 Astrobytes: It accounts for this no?
 MSmits: yeah i dont mind sharing that, but its a complete mess inside my C# oware meta mcts code
 MSmits: extremely complex
 reCurse: I'm kinda hoping fixing that issue will boost my elo
 MSmits: and it backprops net seed score too
 reCurse: Found multiple bad plays caused by that bug
 MSmits: do you have some place with a leaderboard where this bot gets tested?
 MSmits: like CG's
 Astrobytes: The reChess Computer I presume :D
 MSmits: well of course
 MSmits: but it would be cool to beat other chess engines
 NinjaDoggy: just download stockfish and beat it&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: He tests with available engines
 reCurse: Yeah I pick engines off CCRL
 MSmits: ahh ok
 reCurse: When I start beating an engine by 60% I pick another one higher
 struct: he could also test it in lichess I think
 reCurse: Then the equivalent hardware goes out the window
 MSmits: oh it doesn't run on their stuff
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: thats too bad
 MSmits: well good if you want to keep your stuff private
 reCurse: Then I can batch all I want with all my cores
 reCurse: Ah I think I found a solution
 reCurse: Set a flag when a draw exists with no better score
 NinjaDoggy: wait does AlphaZero/LC0 do anything special in their MCTS?
 reCurse: Reset the flag when a better score is backproped
 reCurse: Set it back when it falls below
 reCurse: etc
 MSmits: oh yeah, you can still use the eval of the draw, instead o f0
 Astrobytes: that's kinda like your one MSmits? 0 for loss, 1 for win, 2 for ongoing right?
 Astrobytes: or whatever it is
 reCurse: So it's kind of a draw negotiation
 MSmits: well thats how i do the solver sure
 reCurse: If the negotiation reaches the root then it's accepted
 MSmits: i think recurse means a different kind of flag
 Astrobytes: not altogether that different
 Astrobytes: conceptually
 MSmits: a flag that sees the draw as 0 or sees the draw as it's eval score even when it's solved
 MSmits: unless i'm mistaken
 MSmits: it's really hard to discuss these things properly
 NinjaDoggy: from my interpretation i'm hearing
 NinjaDoggy: have the parent node of the draw have the flag set to true
 NinjaDoggy: if no other child node has positive eval
 NinjaDoggy: and then set the flag to false when a child (other than the solved draw) has positive eval
 MSmits: might work
 NinjaDoggy: and then he'll probably do something to select the node less when the flag is true
 NinjaDoggy: but in the end check for existing flags to go for draw if no better lines are found
 Astrobytes: Very interesting issue either wayy
 Astrobytes: *way
 MSmits: I've been stuck for hours on the ab pruning + TT problem myself. It's already a hard thing to properly do, but with D&amp;B you have control switching which basically gives you an extra turn or gives your turn away. Headache-inducing. It works again now, which is fine. 
 MSmits: however
 MSmits: I have a much shorter formula, more elegant, gives the same result
 MSmits: and i dont know why&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: what's your TT replacement policy?
 MSmits: oh, i keep upper and lower limits
 MSmits: when they are the same, it's an exact value
 NinjaDoggy: sry what's TT?
 MSmits: transposition table
 Astrobytes: Depth-wise?
 MSmits: It's a solver. I just store all
 MSmits: it's not iterative minimax
 MSmits: i should probably keep depth also and then not overwrite higher depth result
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: but my problem was not that
 MSmits: it was just the conceptual part of it
 Astrobytes: Replace if higher or equal, use if equal depth
 NinjaDoggy: wait for dots and boxes is it not good to generate all moves you can chain?
 NinjaDoggy: like make chaining just 1 move?
 NinjaDoggy: does that explode too much?
 Astrobytes: Or you'll really fk things up if you're not doing things in a certain way
 MSmits: in my solver, when i play a chain, i play the whole thing at once
 MSmits: say a chain is 5 boxes
 MSmits: it gets played at once and either you take all 5 boxes
 MSmits: or you take 3 and give 2 to opponent
 MSmits: so that seems like a split of 2
 MSmits: but i can do it in 1 negamax
 MSmits: that's the elegant formula i discovered which i dont know why it works :P
 Marchete: how in 1 negamax?
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: ok this is my negamax function
 MSmits: template&lt;bool depth0&gt; int Negamax(int a, int b, int bonus, int currentScore, uint64_t map)
 MSmits: a and b are alpha and beta obviously
 MSmits: you can simulate the two things
 MSmits: by doing:
 MSmits: 		int controlScore = -Negamax&lt;false&gt;(currentScore - b, currentScore - a, 0, bonus, map);		int captureScore = Negamax&lt;false&gt;(-(currentScore - a). -(currentScore - b), 0, bonus, map);		best = currentScore + max(controlScore, captureScore);
 MSmits: so a negative negamax for giving away your turn and a positive negamax for keeping control
 MSmits: take all boxes, or all minus 2
 MSmits: (bonus is the doubledealing loss btw)
 Marchete: for me these are two different moves
 MSmits: well they are, in a sense
 Marchete: with turn == all moves until not scoring
 Marchete: and If I end in "free moves" I auto give away to the enemy
 Astrobytes: both valid approaches I guess
 MSmits: i play the whole chain and give the opponent the choice what to do with the last 2 boxes
 Marchete: your score or score -2
 MSmits: but the chain is already gone
 MSmits: so the map is the same either way
 MSmits: only the score is different and who's turn it is
 Marchete: in my case the latter is myscore += score-2; enemyscore+=2
 MSmits: yes, thats it
 Marchete: because they are *freeeee*
 MSmits: but anyways, 2 possible moves right?
 MSmits: when a chain is played
 MSmits: 2 ways to respond
 Marchete: yes, but not 1
 Marchete: on a simple chain, yes
 MSmits: so, now i did this:
 MSmits: int specialB = b - currentScore + bonus;		int score = Negamax&lt;false&gt;(-specialB, specialB, 0, bonus, map);		int best = currentScore + abs(score);
 MSmits: so it's still two negamax
 MSmits: but i only calculate it once
 MSmits: and then just have a + or - sign
 MSmits: (i abs)
 Marchete: too complex for me&#160;:)
 Marchete: I mean
 MSmits: yes for me too, thats my problem
 MSmits: but it works
 Marchete: I never thought that way
 MSmits: tested on 100 million boards
 MSmits: it's also not faster
 MSmits: because the other way just uses TT
 Astrobytes: int score = Negamax&lt;false&gt;(-specialB, specialB, 0, bonus, map); are you missing some '-' or did I miss something 
 MSmits: int best = currentScore + abs(score);
 MSmits: minus sign is irrelevant
 MSmits: because i abs
 Astrobytes: right
 Astrobytes: I missed that part, my bad
 MSmits: mind you, i dont know why it works, but it has something to with the symmetry of lookign from both players positions at the map
 MSmits: impartial game it's called
 MSmits: i shifted the score to make it symmetric around 0
 MSmits: or something..
 missjane: omg I'm so confused I don't know what to do 
 MSmits: it annoys me that it's a pretty formula and i dont get it. Would be ok if it was someone else's work, but i came up with it
 MSmits: anyway, this is my endgame solver, then i extended that solver into the pre-endgame and with pre-emptive sacrifices i also play chains
 MSmits: which means i can use the same formula again..
 Astrobytes: I think it's weird, but if it works, go for it
 MSmits: yeah I guess so... i can also use the other one, it's not slower, just uglier
 MSmits: and i understand it
 Astrobytes: 'other one'?
 MSmits: the one with 2 negamax calls and a max
 MSmits: instead of 1 negamax call and a abs
 Astrobytes: ah right
 MSmits: the thing is, after the 1st negamax it stores in TT
 MSmits: so the 2nd negamax just looks it up
 MSmits: map is identical after all
 Astrobytes: I never use abs in negamax
 Marchete: didn't you have preemptive sacrifices, MSmits?
 MSmits: well i only had an endgame solver, there are no preemptive sacrifices in the endgame as all chains are finished
 MSmits: but i extended it to before the endgame and at first had only normal sacrifices (1 and 2 boxes)
 MSmits: but pre-emptive are super important apparently
 Marchete: I don't know
 Astrobytes: anyways, I'm away to bed, gn people and take care&#160;:)
 MSmits: well it cuts chains
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 MSmits: if a very long chain is about to be formed and you can sacrifice a 3 chain to prevent that, your netscore improves a lot
 MSmits: the thing to remember is that you can never use it to win unless you're already ahead
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 MSmits: you might be ahead when facing a nim player who is sacrificing a lot of boxes to keep control
 MSmits: you can screw his chains this way and he wont have enough points in the endgame
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gn Astrobytes drream travel
 MSmits: your bot does it Marchete
 MSmits: not always correctly, but it does do it
 MSmits: and wins with it too
 Marchete: it backfires a lot
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats why it's good to have it in a solver, if the solver is correct it cant backfire
 Marchete: it's hard to count/guess early
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it makes my solver a lot slower though, looking for ways to prune it
 MSmits: one way of pruning it is to use the alpha
 MSmits: alpha is like the minimum score you can get right?
 MSmits: so if your alpha &gt;= 0, pre-emptive sacrifice should be useless
 MSmits: or maybe &gt;= -1 even
 MSmits: or &gt;= -chainlength +2  or something like that
 MSmits: ab pruning hurts my head
 MSmits: this is why i always test everything vs a non-pruned output
 MSmits: to make sure its faster, but not wrong
 Marchete: I prefer MCTS
 Marchete: I see it more "clean"
 MSmits: played out till endgame you mean?
 MSmits: intermediate eval is complicated here
 NinjaDoggy: I like MCTS too but one thing REALLY bothers me
 NinjaDoggy: which is that the value of a node is the sum of all it's children...
 MSmits: but it prefers the good child
 MSmits: so it's a weighted sum
 MSmits: and the more visits, the more weighted it is
 NinjaDoggy: but it can be so hurtful like in UTTT
 MSmits: play long enough and the other children will be irrelevant
 MSmits: yes, especially on free moves
 NinjaDoggy: moves that give your opponent freedom are seen as good
 NinjaDoggy: because of the sum thing
 MSmits: i see this in meta mcts, they completely bias the game
 MSmits: you need a lot of visits before they are reliably searched
 MSmits: however, visiting them at all is usually a bad idea
 MSmits: because they are not good moves
 MSmits: it's a conundrum
 MSmits: it happens also in yavalath, on a forced move
 MSmits: when you're making forced move, you're automatically playing the correct move. But then it's the opponents turn and he has the choice of tons of bad moves
 MSmits: (it's like a uttt free move, only all the time)
 NinjaDoggy: wait meta-mcts except you replace random rollouts with another mcts?
 MSmits: yes, meaning it takes a lot more time to get a good view of the value of a node
 MSmits: so in my meta mcts, when i get near those free nodes, i see the terrible bias happen live
 MSmits: they get selected a lot
 MSmits: because the opponent doesnt know what to do with them. so much choice, so many crap moves
 NinjaDoggy: so the results are heavily skewed by who has more complexity
 MSmits: in my uttt bot on the leaderboard i bias free moves with 0.2 on value
 MSmits: negatively
 MSmits: so they are less likely to be selected
 MSmits: helps a bit
 MSmits: yes, more complexity but it gets worse when only a small fraction of moves are good
 MSmits: say you get 50 moves to choose from
 MSmits: and only 1 wins you a miniboard and nearly wins you the game
 MSmits: those 49 are really going to bring you down for a long time
 MSmits: until they get enough visits that they will no longer get selected anymore
 MSmits: in combination with their low value ofc
 MSmits: so the player who played the free moves will, for a long time, think this is a good idea
 MSmits: not a problem for the root node, because there will be enough visits to fix the problem, but it will affect exploration deeper in the tree
 NinjaDoggy: are there any formulas that very heavily weigh the best node?
 MSmits: I think there are many mcts enhancements like that
 MSmits: to UCT mostly
 MSmits: but i think you have to look at the game and try different things
 MSmits: many things should help and then turns out they dont help enough to offset performance loss
 MSmits: this is particularly frustrating in uttt. It's really a good place to learn mcts, but not a lot works in uttt beyond the basic mcts
 MSmits: the top consists mostly of high performance + intelligent pruning in expansion
 MSmits: (and NN's )
 Marchete: error #407....
 MSmits: did i break the chat
 Marchete: you did a buffer overflow
 MSmits: haha

 hydroglicerol: weve all been ther
 hydroglicerol: because we are all human
 hydroglicerol: right no one is a bot
 Xcalibre: Automaton2000 would you agree?
 Automaton2000: and it makes you feel better
 hydroglicerol: Xcalibre btw VERY original name
 MostComplicatedUsername: Xcalible I agree completely (With your bio)
 hydroglicerol: ty
 hydroglicerol: y did I write ty
 hydroglicerol: you wherent talking to me
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol
 hydroglicerol: I guess we will never know
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have a question about pr2
 MostComplicatedUsername: If I try to move more pods than there are on a cell (Ex. I move 7 pods from zone 1 to zone 2 even if there are only 6 on zone 1), what happens?
 eulerscheZahl: why would you even try it to begin with?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well I just want some way to move all the pods from zone 1 to zone 2 without much work
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure you won't get that 7th troop an da negative number on the other cell
 MostComplicatedUsername: But will it return an error?
 eulerscheZahl: i think the move will be cancelled completely. just try it
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: F
 MostComplicatedUsername: k...
 MostComplicatedUsername: How do we know which zone is the base?
 MostComplicatedUsername: or "HQ"
 eulerscheZahl: the only zone that you own in turn 1
 MostComplicatedUsername: I mean the enemy's
 eulerscheZahl: the only zone that your opponent owns in turn 1
 MostComplicatedUsername: Wait I'm dum i was thinking of visible zones
 eulerscheZahl: the opponent HQ is always visible, no fog
 MostComplicatedUsername: I forgot we can see owner too
 eulerscheZahl: you can't see the owner in general
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: the owner is hidden by fog of war. even if it's your own cell
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ah
 eulerscheZahl: "Due to an intense fog, units can only see the Platinum and units located on tiles adjacent to or under themselves. The general layout of the map will however be given: the fog will only affect Platinum and enemy PODs. The HQ of both players is always visible, which will let you detect the enemy base on the very first turn."
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yeah, I but I didn't know if we also knew the owner or not
 rmuskovets: eulerscheZahl but you can see territories adjancent to cells with your pods and that does give you the full info (ownerid, platinum, etc.)
 Xcalibre: where else did u find the name Xcalibre, hydroglicerol? :thinking:
 DaNinja: is the referee code available for PR2?
 DaNinja: I found Agades
 hydroglicerol: its the name of everyones sword in minecraft
 hydroglicerol: but you prob have no idea what Im talking about
 Xcalibre: that's true i don't
 hydroglicerol: thought so
 eulerscheZahl: DaNinja the referee got leaked: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/tree/master/Referees">https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/tree/master/Referees</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it's the official referee used on CG. but not published by CG
 DaNinja: thanks
 hydroglicerol: ummm does anyone know how the score in COC works?
 LelouchVC2: There's two sets of tests
 LelouchVC2: Those shown to you while you code, and those behind the scenes made to test your code
 eulerscheZahl: Trueskill ranking (you can put that into google)
 hydroglicerol: thanks Ill try that
 hydroglicerol: mabad
 LelouchVC2: Gay
 hydroglicerol: wow
 LelouchVC2: I should be rank #1 for beating Python/Javascript programmers in character count and speed with C++
 hydroglicerol: imagine in java
 hydroglicerol: how I feel
 LelouchVC2: ðŸ˜‚
 LelouchVC2: I've coded C# which I heard is similar in structure
 hydroglicerol: true
 LelouchVC2: I loved it for practicality and use, but in CoC it probably never wins
 rmuskovets: you beat 'em with java/c++ and i beat them in LUA :joy:
 LelouchVC2: Never heard of LUA till CoC
 hydroglicerol: the thing is I didnt beatem I just started programing this year
 hydroglicerol: for an AP
 rmuskovets: how "advanced" is the default ai in pr2? i win every time i play with it
 eulerscheZahl: the default AI is rarely much better than random moves
 rmuskovets: i thought i coded a good ai, and then you came stating this... anyway, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: just submit and see how it ranks
 rmuskovets: my current ai with dft+random moves is on 863rd place
 eulerscheZahl: dft? discrete fourier transformation?what the hell are you doing?
 rmuskovets: depth first traversal
 rmuskovets: like dfs, but not searching for one thing
 eulerscheZahl: i see. that term is new to me
 Xcalibre: how do i turn off intellisense in the ide?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't. wait till it crashes
 Xcalibre: :stuck_out_tongue:
 -Gamma-: lol
 Xcalibre: it keeps telling me 'Decomposition declarations are a C++17 extension' but my code IS compiled with C++17 on codingame.
 eulerscheZahl: i'll put it in the bug reports channel on discord
 Xcalibre: thanks eulerscheZahl :D
 hydroglicerol: that is one nice frog
 Xcalibre: *toad
 hydroglicerol: is the 1D spreadsheet practice problem anything more then a bunch of if statements?
 eulerscheZahl: there is a reason why it's in the easy section
 hydroglicerol: ahhhh
 hydroglicerol: I thought there might be a planet where easy also ment somewhat fun and non tedious but I guess thats kinda impossible
 eulerscheZahl: same on codeforces and alike: easy is always boring
 hydroglicerol: yup
 lets_think: let's think
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: Was 16th and got crushed down again. Top is no joke&#160;:(
 Nerchio:&#160;;(
 Illedan: Won a game vs euler, all is good
 Illedan: Marchete? You timeout&#160;:(
 Illedan: Top 10 at 100&#160;% :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: i would like to point out that it was a mirror match. sadly it wasn't
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: my bot still has some obvious flaws
 eulerscheZahl: one of which you see in that replay: sending more troops than necessary into dead ends
 eulerscheZahl: 1 is enough
 Illedan: Yeah, I need to handle that better too
 Illedan: I wish we could see the production on screen somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: really old game. be happy that you can see your nickname in fullscreen
 eulerscheZahl: that really bothers me at PR1
 eulerscheZahl: and PCR
 Illedan: true
 Nerchio: I still think for a 5 year old game it's pretty good :p
 eulerscheZahl: chess if over 1000 years old and still actively played&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and PR2 is a good game I think. way better than PR1.

 VincentPinet: i see thanks
 Illedan: No idea eulerscheZahl :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: increase visibility? though it's clear that i can't be there as you control the only entrace
 eulerscheZahl: entrance
 Illedan: Yeah, might be buggy tracking :P
 Csar00: Hi
 Csar00: Test
 Csar00: Does this work
 Thiesjoo: Yup it works
 Astrobytes: Nope. Test failed.
 Csar00: lol
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, I did forget to set CanBe on zones to false -.-
 Illedan: 10 error printing statements later :P
 Csar00: Is this chat running through discord?
 Illedan: no
 Astrobytes: No, they're separate.
 MostComplicatedUsername: Just figured out a way to keep track of my opponent's cells
 Illedan: Ranking stopped again?
 Astrobytes: Cell owners are in the input MCU
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well yeah but when I can't see them
 Astrobytes: Don't overcomplicate things, you can get reasonably high without worrying about that

 hydroglicerol: sorry I ment 1D spread shhet
 hydroglicerol: *-h + e
 MostComplicatedUsername: ewww spreadsheet *shudders*
 Illedan: hmm, why is distributing happening before owning in PR2?&#160;:/
 jrke: what is response time for first turn in PR2
 Illedan: 1 sec

 Illedan: Yeah jrke. 1 sec == 1000 ms&#160;:)
 JBM: in metric countries at least
 JKSTUDIOS2020: yeah
 JKSTUDIOS2020: which of you know python?
 JKSTUDIOS2020: `x`
 MostComplicatedUsername: I use python
 JKSTUDIOS2020: And how do you manage to solve Clash Of Code puzzles? I mean, I don't know how to get the answer, I get blocked
 MostComplicatedUsername: Um
 JKSTUDIOS2020:&#160;???
 MostComplicatedUsername: I can;t give the answer to every puzzle lol
 hydroglicerol: do youmena python or python 3
 JKSTUDIOS2020: python 3
 MostComplicatedUsername: You just read the prompt and answer
 JKSTUDIOS2020: Yeah, I know, but somehow I get stucked and I don't know how to figure it out with code
 hydroglicerol: yup'
 JKSTUDIOS2020: I get mind-blocked
 hydroglicerol: well then you have to train a little bit more I gueess
 JKSTUDIOS2020: And I do that? Doing more clash of code stuff?
 hydroglicerol: well there are also websites desighned to teach you things you might not have known
 hydroglicerol: like code hs which sucks
 hydroglicerol: but there are others...
 hydroglicerol: a lot of the time you are just missing one peice that youve never learnt
 eulerscheZahl: MostComplicatedUsername sometimes i can exclude possible opponent positions. no need to defend without opponent
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i just have bad prioritizing. i spread poorly and allow him to come back and get close to my base on the left side of the map
 MostComplicatedUsername: okay
 eulerscheZahl: oh great, my message finally arrived
 eulerscheZahl: my internet connection is unstable, really annoys me&#160;:/
 jrke: hey euler have u used pathfinder to reach opponent base
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure I did
 Astrobytes: Nah. Magic.
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote that more than 1 year ago
 eulerscheZahl: i don't remember what I had for lunch
 jrke: im getting timeouts in bigger maps 
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 Astrobytes: What are you using jrke
 eulerscheZahl: seems i only compute the dist to my own and opponent base for each cell
 eulerscheZahl: not each to each
 jrke: ok
 jrke: maybe in first turn ya
 Astrobytes: I do all, just in case
 jrke: how whats your algo astrobytes for pathfinder
 Astrobytes: BFS
 jrke: im also trying that only
 Astrobytes: Optimise it a little bit
 Astrobytes: Or you might timeout on the larger maps
 Arphnut: I think what you really need is some good knowledge of your language (here python) and some experience with solving such "reflection" problem.
 jrke: ya timeouts in larger maps
 Astrobytes: I use no more than ~310 ms 
 jrke: K
 Astrobytes: Also, just doing what euler does will save time too
 hydroglicerol: basically always trust the toad
 jrke:&#160;:)
 rmuskovets: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/471550954">https://www.codingame.com/replay/471550954</a>&#160;:)
 rmuskovets: looks like my bot wants to spread out the army
 rmuskovets: that was my current bot vs my {HEAD-1} bot
 Uljahn: i use no more than 40ms in python (with scipy) for greater maps :open_mouth:
 Uljahn: for all-to-all distances and shortest paths
 rmuskovets: my ts bot that does dfs regularly doesn't timeout at all
 Astrobytes: I didn't optimise it yet. Won't until I need to
 rmuskovets: me too
 rmuskovets: premature optimisation is mostly bad&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Mostly&#160;:)
 rmuskovets: yeah
 rmuskovets: its like overengineering
 rmuskovets: you don't know where it gonna end
 Astrobytes: Yeah, gotta know when to leave it alone for sure
 rmuskovets: you may end on creating some skeleton or thinking forward for 20 years
 Astrobytes: lol
 rmuskovets: me is mostly the second variation&#160;:)
 rmuskovets: hm
 rmuskovets: my current bot is doing like a worm or smth
 Astrobytes: Hey Uljahn, your pathing may be fast, but I'm above you, fix it :P
 Uljahn: i see no problem here :smirk:
 hydroglicerol: wait a minute wait just a cotton pickin minute there ARE AI s in COC
 hydroglicerol: AND HOW IS THAT FARE
 hydroglicerol: AND WHY DO ALL OF THEM USE PYTHON 3
 hydroglicerol: the shortest of the languages
 hydroglicerol: I call hax
 Scarfield: they are official, so not to clash alone when to few join
 hydroglicerol: that is smart
 hydroglicerol: but  why python 3
 hydroglicerol: that is a unfair advantage for shortest mode
 struct: python is not the shortest of all languages
 struct: So you can beat them
 struct: also they bots are not hard to beat
 struct: the bots*
 eulerscheZahl: there is nothing unfair about it when everyone is free in the language choice
 Uljahn: also those bots just copy other players' solutions
 hydroglicerol: ahh so its like Im playing a player thanks for explaining 
 Astrobytes: There's an article about it somewhere, on the blog? I don't have the link
 Astrobytes: hydroglicerol <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/</a>
 hydroglicerol: perfect
 eulerscheZahl: that blog is already close to 2 years old :o
 eulerscheZahl: how time flies
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: Won Marchete without timeout on a symmetric map
 Illedan: I can now rest in peace
 Astrobytes: Yeah eulerscheZahl, I initially skipped over it 'cause I thought it was too old!
 Astrobytes: grats Illedan
 Illedan: That will be my last submit&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Pretty nice placement
 Astrobytes: Now get back to your NN
 Illedan: Yeah, my plan
 eulerscheZahl: back then it was easy to get a decent rank in a contest
 Illedan: Yeah, now we got a whole bunch of resources and people sharing stuff
 Illedan: which is nie
 Illedan: *nice
 Illedan: Means all are learning
 Illedan: CG getting more popular
 Astrobytes: Illedan, eulerscheZahl just means he's getting too old for it now. With all these new-fangled languages and C# versions :P
 Illedan: :P
 jacek: come to android world where java 7 is still the thing
 eulerscheZahl: hell no
 Illedan: jacek, go to Xamarin. Where life is chill
 IamTheSmix: hello there
 IamTheSmix: I have just finished my code for the UTTT contest 
 IamTheSmix: I implemented MonteCarlo with python3 
 IamTheSmix: I got 10 Rollouts per/100ms
 IamTheSmix: is it bad&#160;? how many rollouts you think I should get with python&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Well, you need ~20,000+ for legend
 Astrobytes: So I probably wouldn't use python&#160;;)
 IamTheSmix: hmm, what is the highest performance I should get with python&#160;?
 IamTheSmix: I saw one guy legend with python 3 
 Scarfield: i did a version in python that got 200 rollouts per 100ms iirc, then i started learning C++ :D
 jacek: rollouts as in random games?
 jacek: no NN requests?
 Scarfield: full sims
 Scarfield: and yes random
 jacek: oh my
 Scarfield: yee :D
 jacek: not my 10k in 100ms doesnt sound so bad
 jacek: now
 inoryy: 20k is the lower bound*
 inoryy: the python guy you saw got into legend with another lang and submitted broken code with py
 eulerscheZahl: the lower bound changed a bit, CG changed servers
 IamTheSmix: lol so my 10 rollouts are very bad xD 
 inoryy: generally you should forget about python if you want to use search based algorithms like MCTS and minimax
 IamTheSmix: I search in the net and saw that everyone is using python for AI algorithms
 eulerscheZahl: 10 rollouts is about 1 for each possible action
 eulerscheZahl: you get the same result if you print any valid action
 inoryy: you're finding results for ML based solutions which is a completely different approach
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y</a> Here is a video covering a lot of the basics for learning C++
 IamTheSmix: My initiale idea was to do some ML + MCTS 
 IamTheSmix: everyone is recommanding Python 
 eulerscheZahl: but these recommendations don't take the 100ms limit on CG into account
 IamTheSmix: yeah true
 Scarfield: but when you only have 100ms you need a fast language to do enough sims, to find anything valuable&#160;:)
 jacek: also, python is just wrapper for pushing NN to gpu and whatnot
 eulerscheZahl: and these standard frameworks like tensorflow are highly optimized. you code in pyhton but the heavy math in the background is C++ and even your GPU
 jacek: its just you can write stuff quickly there
 inoryy: I wouldn't recommend using ML for CG. It can work but you'd have to be an expert in other approaches already to figure out how to set it up
 IamTheSmix: I just want to learn new algorithm first
 IamTheSmix: and then go next level and get higher performance
 inoryy: you're mixing up two classes of algorithms though
 IamTheSmix: then python -&gt; c++ should be the path to follow? 
 IamTheSmix: @inorry: I didn't get your point 
 inoryy: the ML side is usually detached from what you'd use on CG
 inoryy: and vise versa
 IamTheSmix: yeah I know that for ML, I need some pre-calculated or trained engin 
 wlesavo: reminds me of my first implementation for NS with nested lists and deepcopy all over the place  :slight_smile:
 IamTheSmix: I tired to upload trained data but the CG toled me that my code is big 
 IamTheSmix: lol
 Scarfield: yea 100k char limit
 jacek: char, not bytes *
 IamTheSmix: I think it's only 50k
 eulerscheZahl: 100k
 Scarfield: I hope you will invent a new search algo, it could be called SmixiMax :p
 IamTheSmix: hahaha
 jacek: with prune array
 IamTheSmix: I will call it  NegaSmix
 Astrobytes: NegaCegaSmix if you use Prune Array
 MostComplicatedUsername: If only pr2 had a coordinate system...
 eulerscheZahl: why do you need it?
 Astrobytes: Did you pay attention when we gave you your brief introduction to graph theory last night or what?!
 Astrobytes: So eulerscheZahl, can you be bothered to revisit your code and wreck Ille?
 LelouchVC2: Who has time to revisit their code?
 jacek: finally! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471583026">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471583026</a>
 Nerchio: this is a game from mexico ye?
 Astrobytes: lol jacek, gg :D
 jacek: i thought it was ancient egypt
 jacek: done with my prune array

 Nerchio: nvm not mexico, I saw it in Africa
 Astrobytes: Nercio, this game is found everywhere, think it originates in Africa
 Nerchio: yeah my mistake, I saw it in shop when i was on holidays in Africa :D
 Nerchio: funny to see it on cg
 Astrobytes: LOL jacek, actual prune array
 Astrobytes: Did you switch to EPT MCTS or still on a/b jacek?
 Astrobytes: Either way, I'm coming for you after this PR2 stuff
 jacek: im still way behind you
 jacek: im working on eval so fa
 Astrobytes: Way behind is not far enough :P
 Astrobytes: Cool, they're not easy params to fit in this game
 Astrobytes: If we had more calculation time it would be more straightforward I guess, but the CG limit makes it more of a challenge
 AggYz: i love destorying python and javascipt devs in shortest mdoe
 AggYz: mode
 AggYz: a,S="",io.read();for i=1,#S do if string.byte(string.sub(S,i,i)) &gt;= 65 and string.byte(string.sub(S,i,i)) &lt;= 90 then a=a..string.sub(S,i,i)end end print(a)
 AggYz: all of that is one line in lua
 AggYz: it filters all the capital letters out of it using ascii codes
 AggYz: u dont even need to use semicolons
 inoryy: Nerchio are you still playing sc2?
 Nerchio: no
 Nerchio: got tired of it for now
 inoryy: ah, bummer
 Astrobytes: Next logical step is SC2 AI then :shrug: :D
 inoryy:&#160;;)
 Nerchio: i prefer #1 in thibpat contest on progression leaderboard
 Nerchio: xD
 Astrobytes: haha nice, grats
 Rsrsl: @AggYz: I don't really get your point; how is that shorter than
 AbundantPuddle: (len(lis_fl) - 1
 inoryy: filter(str.isupper, input())&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: ignore that
 Rsrsl: print("".join(filter(str.isupper, input())))
 Rsrsl: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: Doctor Foster went to Gloucester, In a shower of rain; He stepped in an AbundantPuddle, Right up to his middle, And never went there again
 hydroglicerol: how *sob**sob* sad
 AbundantPuddle: Foster is Australian for beer.
 Nerchio: I just realised that when your bots die in PR2 you lose vision so you need to manually detect that and mark that you're losing tiles
 Nerchio: especially important in corridors
 Astrobytes: LargePool Aussies don't drink that crap unless they move to London
 AbundantPuddle: Nobody in Australia drinks that, period.
 Astrobytes: They lower their standards when in the UK.
 Astrobytes: Despite the fact you can get VB, Tooheys and Castlemaine
 MostComplicatedUsername: In pr2, can you see your own cells even if your pods aren't adjacent to them?
 Astrobytes: MCU, " units can only see the Platinum and units located on tiles adjacent to or under themselves"
 Nerchio: problem is the input is given for the whole map each round
 Nerchio: hexes you can't see are neutral =/ need to account for that
 Astrobytes: And you know about the debug settings right MCU?
 Astrobytes: yeah Nerchio
 Nerchio: input is very much outdated so prepare to deal with it :P
 Nerchio: if you find platinum on hexes first time remember to never overwrite it to 0
 Nerchio: ok im done with death detection will use it tomorrow
 Astrobytes: Kinda fun having a multi to concentrate on 
 Astrobytes: Good motivation
 Nerchio: y although I feel like people could be more interacting and sharing strategies
 Nerchio: i mean there is not much to win :P
 Astrobytes: Not *that* many people participating compared to real contest though, plus it's an old game
 Astrobytes: Be better when he does it next time maybe with a new game I guess
 Astrobytes: Still fun though
 Nerchio: I didn't know what the game is before he announced it but now that I sat down its actually pretty nice
 Nerchio: i actually like this game more than pacman :p
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I only submitted a "WAIT" bot before (2 years ago lol), was lacking motivation to try it again :D
 Astrobytes: I like most games more than that Pacman :P
 Illedan: ^
 Illedan: oh, wala joining the top too :D
 Illedan: Pushing me up at least :tada:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Nerchio: illedan you have something sophisticated going on in your bot? :P
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: If jungle + bruteforce actions
 Astrobytes: I tried to ask euler if he was gonna participate cause you rekt him but he either left or didn't reply in sheer disgust
 Illedan: xD
 Astrobytes: Also surprised robo never had a bot in this multi
 macnack: someone want help me with my game? this is sfml project game like Building Panic
 Astrobytes: It's not really a game programming website macnack
 Astrobytes: It's more about writing programs to play games
 Astrobytes: You'll get better help in one of the SFML communities
 macnack: okey thanks meen
 hydroglicerol: is there a dark mode for this website if not can we make a petiton for one?
 hydroglicerol: or do I have to learn HTML and this is all a test
 MostComplicatedUsername: There is dark mode
 MostComplicatedUsername: Go to settings
 MostComplicatedUsername: THen turn on dark mode lol
 jimmyjansen93: hmmm where can I find that in the settings, I must be blind
 jdebr:  it's the three circles on the bottom left, hover over them to see the tooltips

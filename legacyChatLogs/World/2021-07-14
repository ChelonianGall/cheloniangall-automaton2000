 derjack: good morning
 dbdr: \o
 FFly: hello world
 derjack: :upside_down:
 FFly: :grin:
 JormaW: can someone help me publish a puzzle here? Having trouble running the tests
 derjack: what puzzle
 JormaW: an easy puzzle ive got
 derjack: what trouble
 JormaW: You get an input between 2 and 26 and according to that you should output a square of letters so the box always has one A in the middle of it, the next layer will be B:s all around the A, the next layer will be C:s all around the B:s, and so forth all the way up to 26.
 BlaiseEbuth: And what do you want to do with that&#160;?
 JormaW: Output the letter square on the screen.. print it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah
 JormaW: Thought it was a pretty hard puzzle for me to do and I've gotten 4 easy puzzles done here so I thought it could fit in the easy category
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't get if this is a puzzle you're solving or creating... Need more coffee
 JormaW: Im trying to create it but couldnt get the tests to go through
 JormaW: Coffee sounds good though
 KiwiTae: there is a clash of code like this
 JormaW: How can i find those?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah I think this is more fitted for a clash than a puzzle
 JormaW: I mean i dont want to make a duplicate of the puzzle if there already is one but I'm not really sure how to find them either.. Is there an easy clash category that I could browse as well?
 BlaiseEbuth: Not directly sadly. But you can try with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 JormaW: oh wow
 BlaiseEbuth: And hi eZ&#160;! Sorry for the ping :p
 NavLol: sup
 dbdr: \o Marchete
 Marchete: o/
 dbdr: you have some useless inputs in oware
 Marchete: it seems a better bot, isn't it?
 dbdr: seems so
 Marchete: what useless?
 dbdr: scores &gt;= 25 are never used
 dbdr: since it's a win
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: I saw it
 dbdr: why did you pick &lt;27?
 Marchete: it should be 26
 Marchete: 0..25
 dbdr: 25 excluded
 Marchete: I changed to SIZE_CELL_NN=28SIZE_SCORE_NN=26
 Marchete: but I haven't seen any improvement
 Marchete: I think 28 is too much
 Marchete: 25 excluded?
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: it's true
 Marchete: once you hit 25 it's a win
 Marchete: so 0..24
 dbdr: also score 1 is impossible
 dbdr: so it can be packed on 3 avx regs&#160;:)
 derjack: :o
 Marchete: how 3?
 dbdr: 3*8 = 24
 BlaiseEbuth: lier
 dbdr: 0 and 2..24
 derjack: do you have limit on max seeds per house? i assume 31 the max
 derjack: maybe 23 seeds max would be sufficient
 dbdr: yes, limit is 23 in stock cgzero
 derjack: oh?
 Marchete: stock :D
 derjack: vanilla
 dbdr: vanilla if you prefer
 Marchete: I just put some value there, as a guess
 dbdr: arf
 Marchete: it's not like anything well thought
 derjack: so maybe you could benefit more from more seeds :v
 Marchete: "640KB should be enough"
 dbdr: again 0..23 is good as a multiple of 8
 dbdr: I haven't seen huge stacks (kroos?)
 Marchete: but I no longer need an "input" for one hot
 Marchete: I directly do the first layer output
 dbdr: ah, you optimized that?
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: reset() -&gt; set first layer to bias
 dbdr: yes, you can just index
 Marchete: then setbit(N)
 Marchete: add to that layer weights[N]
 Marchete: then once you have that layer
 JormaW: Is there someone here who could help me with a small flask/html/sql project problem?
 Marchete: ReLU(intermediate,output)
 Marchete: I don't know how much that improves
 Marchete: not enough considering you have +1.6pts over me
 dbdr: you mean you don't measure? :scream:&#160;;)
 Marchete: measure what
 dbdr: speed
 dbdr: ah you mean TS points?
 Marchete: leaderboard points
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: I hope you know how much speed it gives
 Marchete: you need some better winrates against smits, recurs_e and you can be 2nd
 dbdr: yes, pretty good against top 3
 Marchete: nope, I think "a bit"
 Marchete: 0/1/11 vs Robo is a huge win right now
 dbdr: bad against 6-8
 dbdr: I implemented the weighted random
 dbdr: without temperature
 Marchete: agad_e as p2 is weird, he doesn't play the normal move
 dbdr: gave this bot in one gen. not sure if this is a direct consequence or just lucky
 Marchete: I implemented it, but I fear it polluted the samples
 coolbandit99: hi
 coolbandit99: :grinning:
 derjack: top is pretty much rps
 derjack: ohai
 dbdr: why polluted, aren't they excluded?
 Marchete: it depends on how you implemented it
 Marchete: why they should be?
 dbdr: I was thinking better (weighted) random moves should improve a bit the samples for the value predictions, since the bot is stronger. might be negligible
 Marchete: did*
 Marchete: how did you implemented it?
 dbdr: it's what you mentioned in the final words
 Marchete: I know
 dbdr: those samples are excluded by your implementation
 Marchete: all of them?
 dbdr: you even have a comment about it:
 dbdr: yes
 Marchete: let me rephrase
 Marchete: I added some random selection, with rnd.NextInt(1000) &lt; 15
 Marchete: so it only happens in 1.5% of samples
 dbdr: actually, the samples have the visit distribution, not the selection, right? so why excluded it at all?
 Marchete: and I marked them as dontGenerateReplay 
 dbdr: yes
 Marchete: but the point is that in original papers
 Marchete: they don't say anything about that
 Marchete: they just say "weighted random selection"
 Marchete: so are you doing a weighted with 1.5% chance
 Marchete: or always?
 dbdr: you mean you fear it would pollute if you didn't have dontGenerateReplay, right?
 dbdr: 1.5%
 Marchete: exactly
 dbdr: ok, I misunderstood
 Marchete: I initially added without the 1.5%
 Marchete: and without dontGenerateReplay 
 dbdr: so you improved alphazero. or discovered an aspect they failed to document
 Marchete: so it was adding a lot of noise
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: if you generate 5000k games
 Marchete: it's good
 dbdr: but the samples contain the selection?
 Marchete: because white noise will be cancelled
 dbdr: I thought it had the visit counts
 Marchete: in the original paper they don't talk about how that random selection affects sample quality
 Marchete: I think it affects
 Marchete: if you random move and lose, you shouldn't learn that part
 Marchete: what I was trying are two things
 Marchete: 30% chance of random selection
 Marchete: then set:
 Marchete: 				if (tmpValue &lt; 0.87*bestValue)				{					dontGenerateReplay = true;				}
 Marchete: mark as bad if the selection differs a lot from best value
 Marchete: maybe it's better 0.95 or something higher
 Marchete: I was also trying that in the replay buffer
 Marchete: if I "win" with a random move, try to use it as a good sample
 dbdr: you don't store the sample, but the parent is still affected, right?
 Marchete: but I think I have sign problems
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: I backpropagate the boolean
 dbdr: ah ok, so only children are saved, to add variety
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L2537-L2551">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L2537-L2551</a>
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: you can't sample a loss if later moves were random
 Marchete: but you get more variety on depth
 Marchete: I think that's "better" than original
 Marchete: because original is more brute force
 Marchete: do zillion of games so all that noise will cancel out
 dbdr: assuming original (paper?) saves all replays?
 Marchete: 500k games
 Marchete: If I recall
 Marchete: in oware that would mean around 80M positions
 Marchete: my changes (with sample deduplication and that) saves a lot of time and space
 Marchete: and it doesn't need days to train to a good position
 Marchete: I don't know your design
 Marchete: but I reach top10 like in 2hrs
 Marchete: "reach" as winning top8-top10 guys
 Marchete: in just some IDE tests
 dbdr: I'm still running your code, just tweaking and playing with it to get some understanding
 dbdr: so my design is your design&#160;;)
 Marchete: you understand better than me&#160;:) +1.6 points
 martinpapa69: hi
 Marchete: I'm retraining with different ideas, but I can't beat my current submitted bot
 derjack: yeah, deciding about how to and what to explore is quite important
 dbdr: or it's a fluke, against most players there are a few matches that repeat over and over
 Marchete: in fact yes
 dbdr: szia martinpapa69
 derjack: it sky rocketed when i used softmax with variable temp thingy to decide what moves to use
 Marchete: most players are like deterministic
 Marchete: variable temp? where?
 Marchete: and what game?
 derjack: in my own framework, during training
 dbdr: Winrate 31.9444 23.4848I wish I understood what causes such dramatic regressions. does not look right to me
 martinpapa69: I too finally sucessfully run your train script with a small NN. compressed with the scripts you added to the playground. but when i run the code in ide, i get a simple:timeout. :D any idea why&#160;?
 derjack: keep in mind i only use value
 derjack: martinpapa69 any error?
 martinpapa69: Game Summary:martinpapa69 timeout!
 Marchete: NN weights are called w32?
 Marchete: best.w32
 martinpapa69: yes
 Marchete: probably incorrect binary
 dbdr: nothing on console?
 dbdr: even the decoder should print something, right?
 Marchete: first thing on console is:
 Marchete: CODINGAMEusing Neural Network 0.0900959
 Marchete: CODINGAME is even before reading a file
 martinpapa69: so i guess, for me, the binary doesnt even start
 Marchete: how did you compile it?
 martinpapa69: copy pasted the 3 script lines
 martinpapa69: i changed "$AI_Name" to CGZero
 Marchete: it should work
 martinpapa69: not sure if its correct
 martinpapa69: okay, i guess i have some debug-homework then before i send it to the arena :D
 Marchete: the problem is that you don't have avx2 in your CPU
 Marchete: so you can't just test it
 martinpapa69: i rewrote the code to awx only
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: then try locally
 Marchete: create a net dotnet project
 Marchete: add the cs file
 Marchete: and dotnet run
 Marchete: it should decompress and run the code
 martinpapa69: ye good idea, maybe i get some error messages
 Marchete: I usually did that to "recover" submitted weights, when I can't recall what generation was
 Marchete: if not
 Marchete: use the original NN_Mokka.h, and try to compile
 Marchete: even if you don't have avx2 it should compile to that target
 Marchete: your custom avx it's for your PC
 Marchete: not for CG
 Marchete: CG has avx2
 dbdr: beating robo as p2: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/570094556">https://www.codingame.com/replay/570094556</a>
 Marchete: p2 is really hard to win
 Marchete: if I ever with Robo is with p1
 Marchete: (#UNAUTHORIZED): "You are not authorised to view replay 570094556".
 derjack: huh
 Marchete: let me in, let me iiiin!
 derjack: a mere mortals cant see the robo lose
 dbdr: strange
 dbdr: this is an IDE match
 RoboStac: it's ok, I'm happy if there is no proof of me losing
 Marchete: you can repeat the win?
 Marchete: NN are very deterministic, at least mine :D
 Marchete: can you*
 martinpapa69: it looks like there is something wrong with my upx Marchete. after i run the the upx script on the cgzero executable, and try to run the output exectutable it wont print out the welcome message(using Neural Network 0.0255805), or anything
 Marchete: then it's wrong, yes
 Marchete: always test the binary, if it says using Neural Network
 Marchete: it's OK
 dbdr: second match as p2 vs robo was a draw
 Marchete: that's a win for me too
 Marchete: p2 draw == win
 dbdr: yours is actually trying to be less deterministic with the bestMoves vector
 Marchete: it's barely noticeable
 Marchete: also I tried the jace_k way of mixing mean Score and log(visits)
 Marchete: maybe it's not enough
 Marchete: it seems to me that visit counts are very uneven
 dbdr: I think this helps when a good move is discovered late
 Marchete: like 1 move taking 95% of visit budget
 dbdr: that would mean exploration is too low, possibly?
 dbdr: though it can be good for tree reuse
 Marchete: in theory it should auto adjust
 dbdr: how?
 Marchete: dunno :D
 dbdr: if exploration is too low it will just exploit
 Marchete: policy?
 Marchete: I don't know how it solves the case:
 derjack: no policy - no probelsm :innocent:
 derjack: ~
 PepitoPepe: y
 Marchete: at some point it thinks move0 has policy 0.98 because it seemed good
 Marchete: how to change to move1 as best?
 Marchete: it seems hard
 Marchete: I was trying to use a higher cpuct on train
 Marchete: to give more exploration in learning
 Marchete: but I'm clueless (as in most hyperparameters)
 martinpapa69: removing the "--ultra-brute"  form the upx command solved my problem
 Marchete: good
 Marchete: then pack and test the bot
 dbdr: if move1 is better than the policy thinks, the sample will learn that, even if it does not select it
 martinpapa69: i sent it already
 dbdr: then next generation it will try it even more
 martinpapa69: looks like it wil lend up in mid 10's
 RoboStac: I found I got really extreme policies when I had too many mcts iterations
 Marchete: how much training?
 dbdr: so it might need a few gens to do the switch, if it was not close
 martinpapa69: I trained it for like an hour, and my network is rly small atm
 Marchete: 1 hour?
 Marchete: noice
 Marchete: I think my pipeline is fast to train to a good level
 derjack: 51% winrate vs random :tada:
 Marchete: no no no
 Marchete: 46% vs random at gen3!
 dbdr: derjack lol
 Marchete: :rofl:
 martinpapa69: ye its surprisingly fast. every other framework i checked suggests days of training
 PepitoPepe: no no no
 PepitoPepe: 45% vs random at gen3
 PepitoPepe:&#160;!
 Marchete: yeah, like 3 days on GPU
 Marchete: NN models of 3MB size
 RoboStac: most online frameworks are for massively deep convolution networks which do take a lot longer
 Marchete: that's true
 dbdr: maybe other frameworks replicate alphazero sizes, which does not have the CG size and speed constraints. so you need a lot more training
 Marchete: but on python
 dbdr: that too
 RoboStac: oware seems to learn fairly quickly too
 RoboStac: my c4 took a lot longer to stabilise
 dbdr: c4 with convolutions, right?
 RoboStac: nah
 dbdr: input of oware is small
 RoboStac: couldn't get the performance to work for that
 Marchete: it's a pity C4 goes better with dense
 Marchete: I wanted to try CNN
 Marchete: c4 inputs are smaller
 derjack: you can still do exercise
 derjack: CNN is just slower
 RoboStac: it can still get top 10
 dbdr: ah yes, more squares on c4, but only 3 possible states
 dbdr: oware has seed counts
 Marchete: :lifter:
 Marchete: only 1CNN isn't that slower
 Marchete: I "converted" it to Dense
 martinpapa69: i think the main problem with my oware-alphazero implementations was, that is gave the seed counts directly as an input, not in one-hot format
 derjack: but 63 squares in c4, and 14 things in oware
 derjack: yeah, who gives inputs directly to NN...
 Marchete: each input bit in CNN affect X outputs with W
 Marchete: so I recreated these W as weights[InputBit]
 RoboStac: direct inputss worked fine for me for a while&#160;:(
 Marchete: until when?
 RoboStac: just before last contest when jacek convinced me to try one hot
 derjack: he was in top4 anyway
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: i think one-hot are good for CPU constraints
 Marchete: "more info" with just 1 set
 Marchete: value_loss: 0.0641
 Marchete: if I weight more the value loss
 Marchete: like it doesn't miss
 Marchete: but  policy_loss: 0.7716 :D
 dbdr: value_loss: 0.1603 - policy_loss: 0.3325
 dbdr: and I kept the 1-1 weights
 dbdr: I think you broke something Marchete
 Marchete: 2-1 weights
 dbdr: ah maybe it's that then
 Marchete: I'm just testing dumb stuff
 dbdr: try 1-2&#160;;)
 Marchete: I don't know what's better
 dbdr: 1-sqrt(2), has better mathematical properties
 dbdr: *bullshit
 Marchete: why resubmit martinpapa69?
 dbdr: while (!first) resubmit();
 martinpapa69: ^ :D
 Marchete: have you set your cpuct for submit?
 martinpapa69: nah
 martinpapa69: should i modify it before submit&#160;?
 Marchete: you can do it on IDE
 Marchete:&#160;;./CGZero");
 Marchete:&#160;;./CGZero cpuct 0.0 cpuct");
 Marchete: for example
 Marchete: at some point of debug text you should see it:
 Marchete: "parent_F: CPUCTX.X"
 Marchete: just to test on arena
 Marchete: I find sometimes best parameters  training&#160;!= arena
 Marchete: well, 13th
 Marchete: is not bad
 martinpapa69: ye i trained the nn for like 1 more hour, wanted to try the most recent one
 derjack: already better than cosmobytes
 Astrobytes: shut it pony boy :P
 Marchete: beat that Astrobyte_s guy :P
 Astrobytes: What is that now, 8 or 9 NNs?
 dbdr: top 9 - MSmits + martinpapa69?
 dbdr: so 9?
 Astrobytes: oh, and Ille, he's further down but it's NN
 dbdr: shame
 derjack: pb4 not NN?
 Astrobytes: Hm, you may be right there
 RoboStac: I think there might be a few lower down ones too
 dbdr: pb4 is suspicious in python
 RoboStac: quite a few people were asking me questions and trying to get something working when I first did it
 Astrobytes: Tiramo n had one but think it's still in the lower league
 dbdr: first other non-compiled language is #42 Zorg1
 dbdr: and that's a minimax IIRC
 derjack: :older_man:
 derjack: i wonder what remi uses <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1370475619998392328">https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1370475619998392328</a>
 Astrobytes: Surprised he hasn't tried Oware
 dbdr: different variant?
 derjack: there are 3 games i think
 Astrobytes: Plenty mancala variants to choose from
 Marchete: Smits it's "The indomitable village" from Asterix :rofl:
 dbdr: excepts dominated&#160;;)
 Marchete: on top10 he is holding
 dbdr: yeah
 Marchete: and imo he can wreck most NN's with his MetaMCTS
 Marchete: and books
 Marchete: he just doesn't want to
 Astrobytes: Yes, he disabled the booking to keep the peace, so to speak
 dbdr:  //Play as p0
 dbdr: stopwatch is shared by all threads
 dbdr: it is also unused in pitplay.
 dbdr: but that's confusing
 dbdr: Marchete
 Marchete: yeah, it would create a race condition
 Marchete: should be removed from all pitplay and selfplay
 dbdr: or keep searching indefinitely&#160;:)
 Marchete: btw adding a #define RELEASE_MODE and conditional removing most training part
 dbdr: no, just longer
 Marchete: the binary size is around 30KB when submitting to CG
 dbdr: yeah, wasted space&#160;:)
 Marchete: at some point in the past I had some issues with Random class and threads
 Marchete: like using the same object for all threads wasn't a good idea
 Marchete: similar to my stopwatch
 Marchete: a bad implementation
 Marchete: I should define one instance in each worker, pass it as parameter, etc etc
 dbdr: in rust thread unsafety is a compilation error, that's good for peace of mind&#160;:)
 Marchete: indeed
 Marchete: c++ is more "oh! you want to add to a vector and at the size time clear it? cool! let's do it and see what happens!"
 dbdr: and keep a reference from inside the vector too
 dbdr: :upside_down:
 Marchete: the worst thing is that C++ tends to invalidate references when adding stuff to a vector
 Marchete: sure chaos
 dbdr: yeah, as soon as it reallocates
 Marchete: like always :D
 Marchete: happened to me a lot on NumberShifting code
 Marchete: until I found the bug
 dbdr: well, growth is usually exponential, like double the size
 dbdr: so many pushes will not reallocate
 martinpapa69: u can solve it with reservere, when you know the max size
 martinpapa69: *reserve
 dbdr: which is worse, some bugs will happen only occasionally
 dbdr: reserve is good for performance too
 derjack: welp, like with NNs, threads will work most of time even if they have serious bug
 dbdr: welcome to top10, martinpapa69&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: hi :D I wonder how many of marchete's framework will run on hte next contest
 Marchete: Zero
 martinpapa69:&#160;?
 Marchete: CGZero
 martinpapa69: noo&#160;:(
 Marchete: I mean, it's feasible
 Astrobytes: *if the next contest is a multi
 Marchete: but you need to understand, tweak/recreate
 dbdr: next contest will be a golf
 Marchete: my framework should be a reference
 Marchete: as everybody code in its own way
 martinpapa69: dont think its hard to modify the code to run on single player games, like CvZ
 Marchete: 10 out of top11 in oware are NN :D
 dbdr: to golf, though? the weights take too much space
 Marchete: reminds me of GA in CSB
 dbdr: oldjohn is NN?
 Marchete: lol, it rained since that...
 Marchete: I guess, C#?
 dbdr: ah. some people actually use C# tho&#160;;)
 Marchete: he wasn't C# until recently
 dbdr: ok
 Astrobytes: truew
 Astrobytes: *true
 Marchete: the dotnet thing is cumbersome
 Astrobytes: Normally uses C++ iirc
 derjack: i wonder if the framework were in D, we would see more D people
 LlaeSevero: Good Morning Good people 
 dbdr: should not be hard to write a D packer
 BrucevLee: HIkind of new hey 
 BrucevLee: how can we learn the basic or practice to code   
 derjack: try onboarding, the descent or temperatures puzzle
 BrucevLee: ok thanks 
 LachlanB: I think im getting a graphical glitch on the AI bot racing, it seems none of the bots move, yet I still win the race. is this a known bug?
 derjack: can you share the replay
 LachlanB: the replay is fine when I visit the share URL, just when its in the IDE it does not move a frame
 dbdr: LachlanB try reloading the IDE webpage
 LachlanB: Fixed it, thanks guys. I shouldve restarted as troubleshoot step #1...
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k</a>
 PanGami: :scream:
 LachlanB: Hahaha, oopsie
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Marchete: how do you improve that fast martinpapa69?
 derjack: cloud computing
 Marchete: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Marchete: ragequit!
 martinpapa69: haha, no i train on my laptop. I added 1-1 layers to the value and policy head, and trained a bit. now im adding 1 more layer to the common NN
 derjack: whats 1-1 layer
 martinpapa69: 1 layer to value, 1 layer to policy
 martinpapa69: and i use adam optimizer instead of sgd. i think it converges much quicker
 Marchete: really?
 Marchete: I've always heard SGD, and momentum
 Marchete: I mean at some early time I tried Adam, but it was before I get it working
 dbdr: RL seems like cargo cult programming taken to the next level :D
 martinpapa69: it seems to be faster... I used to work  with nn-s back than and came to the conclusion, that most of the time you dont have to think about optimizer, just use ADAM :D
 martinpapa69: it was years ago tho, dont know if there is some better-adam since than
 derjack: i think in AG(Z?) paper they used SGD + momentum, and didnt used other fancy optimizers for some reason
 derjack: welp, not that training the NN is big part of learning
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7904d10-3111-4a28-a990-a3034002f15e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7904d10-3111-4a28-a990-a3034002f15e</a>
 martinpapa69: :D
 Marchete: in fact in many papers they also said momentum=0.9
 Marchete: like it's SGD yes or yes
 Astrobytes: The lack of Adamski disspoints me.
 Astrobytes: *disappoints
 Marchete: the good thing about using commercial ML frameworks is that you can test all this in no time, bug free
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/30344/why-not-always-use-the-adam-optimization-technique/30347">https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/30344/why-not-always-use-the-adam-optimization-technique/30347</a>
 Marchete: pulling a complete ML framework by  oneself it's like creating Linux from scratch...
 dbdr: recurs@ did it didn't he?
 Marchete: indeed, and probably CSB guys too
 derjack: and i did, but i only did basic nn stuff
 Marchete: it's great for learning, but I just have no idea where to start...
 derjack: that could be also why i stick to value only
 dbdr: Marchete: you started, you have the inference
 dbdr: I guess the next step would be the backpropagation
 Marchete: lel
 Marchete: no I'm fine, thanks
 Marchete: for me ML is just a tool
 dbdr: "You reached the limit..."
 dbdr: guess it's time for a break
 derjack: hm?
 Marchete: stop pressing that button :D
 dbdr: it's not me it's my tool&#160;:)
 Marchete: what tool?
 dbdr: cgbenchmark-like
 derjack: use the alt
 Marchete: I thought it was the play my code
 dbdr: that's what the tool does, ide matches
 Marchete: CG lowered a lot the matches count
 dbdr: yeah'
 dbdr: also replay lifetime, recently
 Marchete: they should add a delete button for history&#160;:)
 dbdr: they could probably reduce replay size by 90% easily
 dbdr: most of these things look very bloated
 struct: sdk replays are huge if you use gem
 dbdr: gem?
 struct: graphic entity module
 struct: recurs e doesnt use it on chess
 struct: one of the reason his replays are so small
 dbdr: nice
 eulerscheZahl: you can also do a mix of graphics module and your own.Or just implement your own serialization and still feed it into the SDK module in the end
 eulerscheZahl: 38 frame replay of Dice Duel<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/analyze/?id=568229737">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/analyze/?id=568229737</a>still some redundancy that we can't get rid of
 Marchete: near 7th place, csip
 martinpapa69: ye, but its losing its momentum, sp o think if i want to improve further, more training wont be enough
 Marchete: how big it is?
 Marchete: maybe space is limited
 Astrobytes: does renard have NN also? Recent submission
 Marchete: it forgets to learn new things
 martinpapa69: my binary is 80kb-ish
 Marchete: you can add #define RELEASE_MODE to cut a lot of code
 Marchete: can be reduced to like 32KB
 Marchete: I do conditional compiling
 martinpapa69: dunno if the network size is the problem here, but ye ill try that
 Marchete: adding -D RELEASE_MODE
 Marchete: to enable or disable it
 Marchete: maybe you can do a makefile or smth
 Marchete: when I asked big, I was refering to weights file
 Marchete: 1st layer is usually faster to calc than later
 Marchete: as you have a lot of zeros
 martinpapa69: the w32 file itself is 83k
 Marchete: ok not that small
 martinpapa69: ye, i think the netowrk size should be fine, i have to look the hyperparameters now
 Marchete: I can't help much more, I also hit a ceiling
 Marchete: the bot seems very sensitive to rollout count
 Marchete: 10k sims worked better than 5k sims 
 Marchete: about hyperparameter, no idea :D
 Marchete: I don't know if it's better to use PROPAGATE_BASE=1.0 (i.e. like Alphazero does), or learning rate, or pretty much anything
 Marchete: and ofc the damn cpuct
 Marchete: I think I know how leela chess do
 Marchete: it's related to visitcount
 Marchete: but that's visit count doesn't change that much
 martinpapa69: no idea. i've only tried changing PROPAGATE_BASE, but it didn't seem to have big impact
 Marchete: but I don't know if cpuct must be 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,2.5 or 3.0
 Marchete: who knows
 Marchete: also I haven't tested much about FPU (first play urgency), they said -1.0, others -parentValue
 Marchete: I also don't know
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct: i wonder if i finally should port arimaa
 struct: I want to know if NNs do well there
 struct: normal searches dont
 dbdr: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 struct: if i remember its like 4 moves per turn
 dbdr: sounds easier for search, low branching
 struct: maybe
 struct: i meant that you do 4 moves per turn
 struct: not 4 moves available
 dbdr: ah, got it
 AllYourTrees: Marchete i think noise weight, cpuct, and num simulations are all interconnected. iirc the goal is for the search to overcome noise, so too low num simulations or too high noise will make it so search cannot overcome noise
 AllYourTrees: err maybe goal is the wrong choice of words - the noise should be at a level where the search can overcome it if it doesnt benefit the probability?
 Marchete: noise on a big amount of samples should be cancelled
 Marchete: but I don't have 5000 TPU years to test
 AllYourTrees: ya haha
 Marchete: or crazy numbers like Google
 Marchete: I think dirichlet noise is cancelled
 Marchete: maybe I should test that
 AllYourTrees: how would you test it?
 Marchete: simulating
 Marchete: one single state, doing N Searches
 Marchete: and see what it returns as policy
 AllYourTrees: maybe the divergence between noisy probs &amp; actual search policy?
 Marchete: with low count it will be noisy
 Marchete: I mean that my fear is that dirichlet for example can give diversity
 Marchete: but I don't want that it was at cost of policy accuracy
 Marchete: I don't know if you understand my point
 struct: are you training for c4 yet?
 AllYourTrees: i think i see
 Marchete: not yet
 Marchete: don't worry&#160;:)
 Marchete:  **yet**
 AllYourTrees: i've only been doing c4 &gt;.&gt;
 struct: you are still doing c4?
 Marchete: with alphazero?
 struct: I dont think ive updated my c4 in 27 days
 Marchete: hmm robo is also too high in c4...
 AllYourTrees: ya ive been mainly updating my stuff locally
 Marchete: I thought it was Smits with his uber books
 AllYourTrees: haven't pushed a new network in a while
 Marchete: you have my code for comparison purposes :D
 AllYourTrees: finally fixed a few bugs in the last week so now im getting stuff rolling
 AllYourTrees: yeah :D
 struct: yeah robo bot is the strongest now
 Marchete: c4 seems easy to implement
 Marchete: put bit -&gt; check win
 Marchete: not like the messy oware
 AllYourTrees: i agree, i tried looking at oware and was like nope
 struct: same
 Marchete: you can win before move
 Marchete: or you can lose when you think you'll win
 Marchete: so I can't recommend
 jacek: c4?
 Marchete: Oware it's like some farmed just pulled random rules out of his a** and put on the game
 Marchete: then something doesn't please him and added more artificial rules
 Marchete: farmer*

 Sajarin_M: hi friends. does anyone know how to change keybinding for "playing all test cases" in the editor&#160;?

 struct: yeah but this keybind is not related to the editor
 TobiasA: if a line is parallel to the x axis and another to the y axis how does one know if they are perpendicular assuming the "person" is a computer
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Because the first line is parallel to the x axis and the other to the y axis&#160;?
 TobiasA: the computer doesn't like division by zero
 TobiasA: how would it know then?
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh yes. I always forget that's so hard to add a 'if' to handle an edge case...&#160;:(

 Astrobytes: Failing a lot helps you succeed as long as you're smart about it.
 BlaiseEbuth: How to enlarge your code in one week with this NN trick&#160;!
 dbdr: fail smart, not hard
 struct: ah yes
 struct: just do a NN then you dont have to code
 TobiasA: i'm still confused on the perpendicular thing
 TobiasA: i can't find the answer on google
 Astrobytes: and not fail soft either dbdr :P

 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, thx Astrobytes
 Wontonimo: :D 
 TobiasA: i ask ppl here when i don't get the answer from searching

 BugKiller_328: what's the difference between 1st and 2nd in making constructor
 BugKiller_328: I saw that it worked differently so I'm asking to know.
 BugKiller_328: 1st. that default constructor is called even I call another constructor with parameter.
 BugKiller_328: 2nd is not called.

 Astrobytes: Also, there are no access specifiers
 BugKiller_328: Astrobytes yes I'll.. thanks.
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 nulte: im not sure there is any diference
 Astrobytes: other than a compiler warning from VS then no
 BugKiller_328: yeah, nevermind. it's same. I've just confused myself.
 nulte: I use the 2nd way though
 nulte: it allows me to do
 nulte: A(int data):data(data){}
 Astrobytes: same, it's cleaner
 BugKiller_328: yes, I always used 2nd, but today I saw 1st way and I thought it could another functionality at first.

 Kozakx: how? i set thrust to 100
 Astrobytes: Maybe you're aiming slightly wrong
 Kozakx: how do i get coordinates of checkpoint?
 Astrobytes: you get the coordinates of the next checkpoint, you can store them
 Kozakx: but where are the coordinates?
 Astrobytes: checkpointX, checkpointY or something similar
 Astrobytes: it's given in the input. But only for the next checkpoint, if you want them all you have to save them
 Astrobytes: *nextCheckpointX, nextCheckpointY, something like that
 Kozakx: ok i see
 Kozakx: but i cannot get through that, just says im too slow
 Kozakx: it starts the code and says im too slow
 Astrobytes: paste your code, sounds like you might not be outputting anything
 Kozakx: i just have the first command
 Kozakx:     print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + "100 " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 100")
 KiwiTae: you are missing spaces
 Astrobytes: and printing 100 twice
 KiwiTae: print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, 100)
 Kozakx: it works now, thank you
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 nulte: bt taking a while to do
 Astrobytes: I'll happily take any optimisation tips for that
 nulte: ill see what I can come up with
 nulte: I was doing a mistake of getting all the moves on rollout
 nulte: which is a bit expensive
 Astrobytes: I still have alphabeta, I go between 28th and 21st
 nulte: Seems good
 Astrobytes: There are other things I can do but I was thinking MCTS ept might just be the easiest
 nulte: I never did ept
 Astrobytes: Once I get a good alphabeta going, switching to EPT isn't so difficult
 doomento: Guys, I think I will master python
 doomento: and I figured out why I can't solve these problems
 doomento: I wasn't thinking programatically
 Astrobytes: Don't think. Feel! It's like a finger pointing at the moon.
 doomento: I still don't know how to get [highest] 
 doomento: cause I can't think
 doomento: :astonished:
 KiwiTae: whats the max "highest" between 1 and 10?
 doomento: 10
 nulte: seems like a trick question
 nulte: how did you get 10?
 doomento: because they said max so I thought get the highest number between 1 and 10
 nulte: do you know how to do that in code?
 doomento: I can uh, try
 nulte: checking 2 numbers is quite simple in most programming languages
 nulte: if (a &gt; b)
 Astrobytes: result = max(a, b)
 nulte: yeah that is simpler
 KiwiTae: result = (a+b+abs(b-a))*.5
 nulte: :nauseated_face:
 KiwiTae: -
 ANONYMOUS42: print(10)
 doomento: :fearful:
 Astrobytes: solved it yet demento?
 doomento: no, I'm still trying a bunch of other things
 Astrobytes: everything other than getting the max right :smirk:
 doomento: I'm supposed to do that?
 doomento: nvm
 nulte: well you did say you couldnt get the highest
 doomento: ok ok:spy_tone4:
 Astrobytes: maximum and minimum, get those concepts down
 Astrobytes: It's when you have a huge mother and a tiny mother
 nulte: check the highest bit that is not present  in the other number
 nulte: but care on negative numbers
 Astrobytes: struct
 Astrobytes: nulte I mean
 nulte: astro
 Astrobytes: Is there a  faster way to do this:_tzcnt_u64(_pdep_u64(1ULL &lt;&lt; (rnd64.getRandomInt(_mm_popcnt_u64(board))), board));
 nulte: whats _tzcnt_u64?
 Astrobytes: ctzll
 nulte: is that to get a random move?
 doomento: So I have to get the highest mountain and then shoot it. Since mountain_h is the mountain height I need to find the index of the highest mountain then shoot it right?
 Astrobytes: aye
 nulte: usually i dont need ctzll
 nulte: because im getting the mask already
 nulte: then I can simply do board |= move
 nulte: does that make sence?
 nulte: currently a move for me in breakthrough is just 2 set bits on a uint64_t
 Astrobytes: Yes. I need to re-read a few 
 nulte: then I can dogs.boards[current_player] ^= move;gs.boards[current_player ^ 1] &amp;= ~move;
 nulte: But im not sure how well this does
 nulte: I havent finished the bot yet
 Astrobytes: that makes sense. I currently have mine as 2 uint8 (from, to) and a score (helps with ordering)
 nulte: yeah it makes sence for minimax
 nulte: sense or sence?
 Astrobytes: sense
 nulte: thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: and for some reason I use bextr to get stuff auto from = _bextr_u32(mv, 0, 6); 
 nulte: also I dont think there is potential for avx in bt
 Astrobytes: not for anything useful, eval maybe?
 nulte: Im not sure its easy to eval moves ehre
 nulte: here*
 nulte: but I could be wrong
 Astrobytes: rank placement of the pawns is important
 nulte: isnt it more important to keep pieces together?
 Astrobytes: yes there's the protection part, but think in terms of attack and defense, where is the threat?
 nulte: Do you take into account other pieces placement when evaling mvoes?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 nulte: ah makes more sense then
 nulte: I thought you were evaling based on piece position only
 Astrobytes: I should work a little more on the eval tbh.
 nulte: I wonder if quiescence search can help here
 Astrobytes: Possibly. I had a little improvement with using killer move, I tried non-capturing only but that doesn't work here (not for me at least)
 nulte: what is killer move?
 Astrobytes: easier to link to it than explain:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Killer_Heuristic">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Killer_Heuristic</a>
 nulte: I see
 Astrobytes: Sorry, I'm quite into my alphabeta minimaxes&#160;:)
 nulte: its totally fine
 nulte: I like to do simple mcts
 nulte: and then optimize and add a few things to the rollout to make it smart
 nulte: my c4 is the example of it :D
 Astrobytes: You may as well do EPT in some cases. Where you at now in C4? Still chasing robo?
 nulte: nah, was never a fight tbh
 nulte: I havent improved it
 Astrobytes: Yeah, looked at the Oware board recently?&#160;:(
 nulte: yeah but its a good thing
 nulte: One day ill try to do a NN aswell
 Astrobytes: Yeah same, it's really cool to see actually
 nulte: only way I could fight him is by adding a book
 nulte: but even msmits is struggling with it
 Astrobytes: lol, then you know it's trouble
 nulte: There is one more person with book
 nulte: but is only 3 plys or something
 Astrobytes: I didn't look recently, who has it?
 nulte: fica
 Astrobytes: ah right
 Astrobytes: I remember from the chat actually
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, my _tzcnt_u64 thing is from Clobber, not BT
 Astrobytes: Still have work to do on that one
 nulte: I still use i though on c4
 nulte: but only on expand
 nulte: So I dont need to store the mask on the node
 nulte: 1 byte vs 8 bytes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I need to work on my clobber nodes tbh
 Astrobytes: Refactoring needed
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I gotta shoot. Take care man, see ya tomorrow
 nulte: gn
 Raibatsu: Chuck Norris puzzle has exactly 80,000 solvers. idk if I should solve it and ruin that perfect number though&#160;:(
 MorningStar37: You must, because you can.
 xiaoyaozi: go run main.go

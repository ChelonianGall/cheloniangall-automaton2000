 cegprakash: I've fixed that major bug
 KnightMoves: come for the code, stay for the drama
 cegprakash: top 20 hopes still alive
 ZarthaxX: there are no tshirts tho
 Icebox: wait what
 Icebox: no shirts this contest?
 ZarthaxX: check the contest description..
 Icebox: why did I even start it then :D
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: don't get too attracted to things
 cegprakash: unless u are top 20
 BenjaminUrquhart: ofc the code I spent the past 4 hours writing performs worse than what I submitted 2 days ago
 cegprakash: haha
 BenjaminUrquhart: how hard could this be
 BenjaminUrquhart: aaa
 dbdr: BenjaminUrquhart 4 hours? try 4 days...
 eulerscheZahl: not a real try-harder
 BenjaminUrquhart: lemme try something and ruin everything again
 Cusumi: i hope all good luck guys
 BenjaminUrquhart: my old code can even do this on occasion<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/467101838">https://www.codingame.com/replay/467101838</a>
 thethiny: "this" winning against Lord?
 thethiny: @eulerscheZahl is there a way to play out the game offline through the brutal tester logs?
 thethiny: currently I have to hit Play then intercept the call and return my custom json
 thethiny: that's because the webpage doesn't work offline
 thethiny: gives network -1
 cegprakash: clock is blinking
 WINWINWIN: Yes, cegprakash top 30 yet?
 BenjaminUrquhart: as expected, the thing broke everything
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know, sorry
 thethiny: np, thanks
 WINWINWIN: Will this be made available as a multi immediately like Ocean of Code?
 eulerscheZahl: probably today already
 WINWINWIN: Nice! Would be most played after CSB :D
 eulerscheZahl: Tron and Back to the Code have a lot of players too
 WINWINWIN: 5K?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 WINWINWIN: Wow, then this is only most played contest
 eulerscheZahl: 5,786 CodinGamers in the Tron Battle arena
 eulerscheZahl: 4,626 CodinGamers in the Back to the Code arena
 eulerscheZahl: and what i don't understand:2,702 CodinGamers in the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe arena
 eulerscheZahl: that has never been a contest
 WINWINWIN: Tic Tac toe wasn't a contest?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 WINWINWIN: Maybe people just joined it as its tic tac toe :D
 eulerscheZahl: was the first SDK game directly added to the multiplayer section. before everyone could upload their own
 WINWINWIN: Oh, so it is the most popular community MP then?
 eulerscheZahl: it was still made by codingame staff
 eulerscheZahl: so not sure how to count it
 BenjaminUrquhart: 3 and a half hours
 BenjaminUrquhart: um
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't count it, vindinium with about 300 players is the most popular
 eulerscheZahl: there's a huge difference between 300 and 2.7k
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl can you run a game against me and give me some tips
 thethiny: tip: Try to win
 BenjaminUrquhart: thanks
 Zenoscave: ^ this
 WINWINWIN: Yes, community MPs are tougher as most are based on board games
 eulerscheZahl: great tip
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467110420">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467110420</a> you win
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh kek
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467110556">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467110556</a>now i win
 BenjaminUrquhart: thanks euler for that genius move by you
 eulerscheZahl: i'm timing out in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: arena has release mode, so not an issue
 WINWINWIN: C# is prone to timeouts in IDE right?
 eulerscheZahl: c# and rust
 thethiny: what do you mean by release mode in arena?
 BenjaminUrquhart: more optimizations
 Zenoscave: NO pdb or debugging symbols
 eulerscheZahl: you are about to pick up both super pellets on the left but then suddenly turn around
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i mean right
 eulerscheZahl: the other left
 BenjaminUrquhart: internal pathing conflict it seems
 BenjaminUrquhart: they think they're gonna collide
 eulerscheZahl: 5 players is chaotic, hard to analyze
 eulerscheZahl: another timeout

 eulerscheZahl: null 3 ms
 eulerscheZahl: great idea
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's not supposed to happen but ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: let me try and fix those 2 things
 eulerscheZahl: frame 16: why the scissors?
 eulerscheZahl: you are not in danger with your paper. and you win't catch a speeding paper with a rusty scissors
 thethiny: lol @benjaminuruqhart you're #418 I'm #419
 eulerscheZahl: also frame 16, rock at bottom left: you speed 1 cell away from the dead end
 eulerscheZahl: if you speed 1 turn later, you can use the speed more efficiently
 cegprakash: last minute change: reducing my depth
 BenjaminUrquhart: speed it nothing more than "spam when available"
 cegprakash: I'm not happy with my simulations
 BenjaminUrquhart: well thanks for your help, let's see how much I can get done
 eulerscheZahl: and now tell me what i'm doing wrong
 eulerscheZahl: except for IDE timeouts
 Zenoscave: You're asking us mere mortals for help
 Zenoscave: That's your mistake eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i'm desperate
 eulerscheZahl: i can see myself and top3 without scrolling
 eulerscheZahl: but not there&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: Send replay against me? don't have cgenhancer on this laptop
 Zenoscave: I'll analyze
 cegprakash: he'll wreck u though
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: u sure?
 Zenoscave: Fresh Eyes to see how he can wreck even more
 Zenoscave: perhaps
 BenjaminUrquhart: I think I found the pathing error
 BenjaminUrquhart: classic off-by-one

 thethiny: guys
 thethiny: if xreturns true if x &lt; 0?
 BenjaminUrquhart: which language
 thethiny: python
 eulerscheZahl: if x&#160;!= 0
 BenjaminUrquhart: I think so
 BenjaminUrquhart: cause bits are set
 thethiny: oh damn
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl do you do parity checking
 thethiny: damnnnn
 eulerscheZahl: parity?
 eulerscheZahl: like before the real checksum was invented?
 DollarAkshay: I think I might make it to legend
 eulerscheZahl: speed on odd coords you mean?
 DollarAkshay: Submitting Code now
 eulerscheZahl: tested offline, was on par with my arena bot
 Zenoscave: if (Target.IsDeadEnd() &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; Target.Dist()&#160;% 2&#160;!= 0) SkipSpeed
 EvModder: best of luck
 Zenoscave: don't do odds. parity of dist works slightly better
 Zenoscave: try that
 eulerscheZahl: i think i have that
 eulerscheZahl: did you see me not doing it?
 Zenoscave: I think once
 Zenoscave: not sur
 eulerscheZahl: at least i do in direct range
 eulerscheZahl: ok, let me try to extend that then...
 Zenoscave: what range? &lt;5 or &lt; 10
 eulerscheZahl: speed and next move with dist=1? =&gt; no speed
 EvModder: ^ that optimizaton was causing an awful bug in my code
 Zenoscave: I also saw this some.
 cegprakash: my winrate is always between 50-60% so it's hard to say any bot I submit is good or bad before it cross at least 50%
 EvModder: works now, but somehow i also broke my pellet heatmap
 thethiny: wd benjamin
 Zenoscave: Make them chase you and switch right before collision
 EvModder: idk if i will get a good submit ready on time so i might just resubmit the code from last night that got to 10th
 EvModder: although competition is going to be harder now =P
 eulerscheZahl: legend bots do't chase
 eulerscheZahl: only kill
 EvModder: yes
 EvModder: chasing is wasting
 Zenoscave: right but if the kill is flawed or you have cooldown == 0 do they still try?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Zenoscave: Ok then I've got nothing
 EvModder: unless... min(my_speed - ur_speed, ur_ability_cooldown) &lt;= dist
 EvModder: then chasing makes sense&#160;;)

 eulerscheZahl: i'm not happy with my spreading
 thethiny: I fixed a value from x to x &gt; 0
 thethiny: now I win against myself by 30
 eulerscheZahl: too many in the same area
 eulerscheZahl: but not sure how to adjust this
 eulerscheZahl: i mean without breaking everything else
 Zenoscave: score exploration higher
 eulerscheZahl: i don't score exploration
 RustyCrown: how do you factor in the warp tunnels?
 Zenoscave: Just harvest points in time range?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I finally found the root of the turnarounds when getting the super pellets
 BenjaminUrquhart: my function for assigning pellets to pacmen doesn't not conside enemy pacs correctly
 cegprakash: I don't know if I should configure my depth based on no. of pellets in map
 BenjaminUrquhart: consder*
 BenjaminUrquhart: consider*
 eulerscheZahl: and dist to pellets from final pos
 cegprakash: for now my depth is based on game turn and pacs count
 thethiny: my depth is based on alive pacs
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't have depth
 BenjaminUrquhart: dab
 thethiny: dab dab
 DollarAkshay: Damn thats deep bro @BenjaminUrquhart
 cegprakash: int customDepth[5] = { 20, 18, 16, 14, 12 };
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm too tired for this
 thethiny: hahaha
 cegprakash: that's what I use
 cegprakash: 20 for 1 pac 12 for 5 pacs
 eulerscheZahl: 6,6,6,5,4
 cegprakash: my bot would do too worse for 6,6,6,5,4 :D :D
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467122375">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467122375</a>what are the odds??
 cegprakash: that's also because I don't have enemy prediction
 DollarAkshay: WTF

 cegprakash: DollarAkshay happens
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i don't increase depth when some of my players decease
 DollarAkshay: Guys will the map width size always me odd number&#160;?
 thethiny: you totally should
 DollarAkshay: be*
 thethiny: @Dollar yes
 thethiny: for symmetrical maps
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl I do it.. u can try
 DollarAkshay: Okay I think I sohuld store enemy positions based on my position on Turn 0
 eulerscheZahl: about to test it
 thethiny: yeah dude
 thethiny: it's always like this
 thethiny: they're always on your -x -1
 thethiny: if you're at 0 they're at width
 thethiny: 1
 thethiny: -1*

 cegprakash: I'm getting a bid for 350$
 cegprakash: :D
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot? :D
 Zenoscave: who sent it?

 BenjaminUrquhart: imagine paying someone to code for them to get internet points
 Icebox: he's getting real life prizes
 Icebox: from his uni
 eulerscheZahl: there's an internal university contest
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 thethiny: another major bug fixed

 Zenoscave: TBD if he takes the offer
 RustyCrown: idk you might be over paying
 Zenoscave: probably going to say Main

 BenjaminUrquhart: my
 BenjaminUrquhart: gosh
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm so dumb
 Zenoscave: Glad you can accept it BenjaminUrquhart&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: jkjk
 BenjaminUrquhart: when assigning super pellets, I never checked if there was a wall...
 BenjaminUrquhart: it was literally a fancy Manhattan 
 thethiny: hahahaha
 DollarAkshay: Something weird is happening
 DollarAkshay: My game_turn variable is getting incremented by 2
 DollarAkshay: on the first turn

 DollarAkshay: Wait a minute
 DollarAkshay: Nevermind
 eulerscheZahl: great BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: of course, the tradeoff is it loses 8/10 of the initial matches
 BenjaminUrquhart: cause why not
 BenjaminUrquhart: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 cegprakash: this MangooTiere at #108 wrecking me
 dbdr: let's see if i can climb back&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: just let it be :fearful:
 eulerscheZahl: arena: 67   Pacman: 79   draw: 40smells like submit
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: that 40 draw is highly suspicious, probably symmetrical matches
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl can you rerun the game with me now that it's submitted? seed=8692787439888939000
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes

 BenjaminUrquhart: he knows
 DollarAkshay: Its almost like it has 6th sense
 BenjaminUrquhart: e v e r y t h i n g
 WINWINWIN: Who is the gold boss?
 dbdr: DollarAkshay you can learn information without seeing a pac directly
 eulerscheZahl: DollarAkshay you can check the score changes
 eulerscheZahl: 0, then 2 for every opponent
 eulerscheZahl: speed, double-move
 DollarAkshay: Oh damn
 eulerscheZahl: there's only one possible direction for such a double move
 DollarAkshay: Never thought of that
 eulerscheZahl: my bot does that too
 DollarAkshay: Holy shit
 DollarAkshay: LMAO I not reaching legend then
 DollarAkshay: im*
 WINWINWIN: I don't understand, how do you know the moving direction based on score change?
 WINWINWIN: There are multiple directions to gain those pellets
 BenjaminUrquhart: process of elimination
 dbdr: not always
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, so this is a tracking system to filter positions?
 cegprakash: legend leaderboard is so unstable
 cegprakash: lot of good bots in bottom
 BenjaminUrquhart: come to gold
 BenjaminUrquhart: talk about unstable
 cegprakash: haha
 cegprakash: no thanks
 Zandy156: no kidding
 BenjaminUrquhart: i might call it a night soon
 BenjaminUrquhart: considering the amount of players and my placement, I think I'm pretty decent where I am
 thethiny: I can beat the boss more, but I lose against my arena self more.
 dbf: how long submit in legent takes to calculate now?
 thethiny: What?
 cegprakash: I think the problem is my seed in srand.. I'll revert my seed to old seed
 DollarAkshay: use seed=69 for maximum rand luck
 BenjaminUrquhart: I was about to meme about using rand but then I remembered that you GA everything
 eulerscheZahl: dbf about 30min
 dbf: eulerscheZahl thanks
 DollarAkshay: @BenjaminUrquhart Nice Jebait 
 BenjaminUrquhart: DollarAkshay complete accident
 DollarAkshay: My bot does no switching at all actually
 DollarAkshay: Kinda sad
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's a few edge cases in my pathfinding while speeding but it'll probably break my bot if I fix them
 thethiny: that'ss what hapenning to me
 thethiny: my bot performs bad when I'm fixing a huge bug
 Zandy156: just make more bugs then
 thethiny: that's what I did
 thethiny: if True:
 BenjaminUrquhart: so, here's my genius plan
 BenjaminUrquhart: wait for this submit to finsh
 BenjaminUrquhart: then wait for the people submitting below me to push me up
 BenjaminUrquhart: not like it's enough for legend, but whatever
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethiny I've really passed you now
 cegprakash: seriously? changing my srand seed took me to top 30 
 cegprakash: what is happening
 DollarAkshay: @cegprakash Did you use 69&#160;?
 cegprakash: I use 42
 DollarAkshay: GG
 cegprakash: the answer to the life the universe and everything
 DollarAkshay: You are unstoppable now
 thethiny: @BenjaminUruqhart yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: epic typo
 WINWINWIN: Cegprakash should the srand seed affect anything?
 DollarAkshay: Naa just luck
 cegprakash: 42 is so powerful
 WINWINWIN: :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: also 5k players
 BenjaminUrquhart: almost*
 WINWINWIN: 40 more
 BenjaminUrquhart: you can tell how tired I am from how I type
 eulerscheZahl: let's quickly create some fake accounts :D
 WINWINWIN: :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: what if I submit my smurf /s
 eulerscheZahl: then you have 2 bots in the arena
 BenjaminUrquhart: hence the /s
 eulerscheZahl: and violate a rule that isn't checked anyways
 eulerscheZahl: Neumann uses a smurf too
 BenjaminUrquhart: banned
 WINWINWIN: What is wrong with a smurf?
 thethiny: new account
 thethiny: for the same person
 WINWINWIN: Yes, but why is it bad?
 BenjaminUrquhart: 2 entries in a contest
 BenjaminUrquhart: and you're only supposed to have 1
 WINWINWIN: they are not creating multiple accs to dominate a leaderboard anyway
 eulerscheZahl: some did have 2 high ranked bots in the past
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. RockyMullet and LuckyMullet
 eulerscheZahl: to see if version 1 is better than version 2
 cegprakash: will all bots submit together or submit 1 by 1 in recalc?
 BenjaminUrquhart: all together
 eulerscheZahl: but if everyone does that, it's a mess
 eulerscheZahl: but only top100
 eulerscheZahl: min(100, legendSize)
 Vadasz: Hmm, and is it legal to have multi acc for testing?
 WINWINWIN: Oh, so resubmit is only for top 100 in legend?
 BenjaminUrquhart: all I'm hearing is I'm not included
 cegprakash: I'm scared to touch anything now on my bot
 eulerscheZahl: 1 account per contest
 cegprakash: even scared to resubmit same bot
 eulerscheZahl: for multiplayer games they are less strict, still not appreciated
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have smurfs in some multis for testing purposes
 BenjaminUrquhart: um
 BenjaminUrquhart: breakthrough and hypersonic
 eulerscheZahl: valid reason to have multiple accounts: you create your own multiplayer game and need some bots in your private arena for testing
 BenjaminUrquhart: which reminds me, I have to update email addresses
 WINWINWIN: What happens if you submit as the contest ends, is the submit evaluated?
 VicHofs: frame 52
 BenjaminUrquhart: all pending submits are finished iirc
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467154138">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467154138</a>
 VicHofs: pure bullshit?
 DollarAkshay: @VicHofs seems like you moved only 1 square with speed
 VicHofs: yep
 VicHofs: 'xcept it doesn't when I replay in same conditions :upside_down:
 DollarAkshay: @VicHofs your output says "MOVE 1 24 7 normal; (23, 7)"
 DollarAkshay: Which sasy you moved only 1 unit
 VicHofs: indeed
 BenjaminUrquhart: Looks like I'm placing roughly 300th out of 5k players
 BenjaminUrquhart: have fun, I need sleep
 VicHofs: that's pretty good tho lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm not making the same mistake as UTG
 BenjaminUrquhart: still salty
 Gonny: haha I remember that
 BenjaminUrquhart: you saw nothing
 Gonny: didn't you multiply your rank by 3 or something?
 DollarAkshay: I dont think we sould even consider people who are in wood 1 and 2
 DollarAkshay: Probably just clikced submit on the default code and left
 DollarAkshay: That would make me 200 out of 4k players
 BenjaminUrquhart: Gonny I submitted the code in my IDE and I forgot it had untested code in it
 Gonny: I am very annoyed. My bot from 2 days ago is much better than my new bot. So much sleep lost for nothing...
 BenjaminUrquhart: literally same
 Gonny: worse is I don't evenknow why, and I'm sure it's the same for you
 Gonny: drives me nuts
 VicHofs: I got to 2 in my league at one point
 BenjaminUrquhart: only thing I changed this entire time was fixing a clearly broken pathfinding
 VicHofs: 1000 rn
 VicHofs: -yay-
 Cappefra: Same Gonny, and it doesn't make sense to me
 BenjaminUrquhart: I was top 10 for all of 5 minutes last week
 Gonny: well at least we're not alone in that situation&#160;:)

 Peudoki: switch has low value
 Gonny: fwiw almost no one uses switch in legend, apart maybe for a guaranteed kill
 Peudoki: guaranteed kill and when my pac is very afraid are the only times I use it
 DollarAkshay: @BenjaminUrquhart LMAo your bot is scared of Emoji's
 DollarAkshay: XD
 DollarAkshay: Taht taunt from @thethiny
 BenjaminUrquhart: hush
 Cappefra: holy shit this submit is moving around like crazy
 thethiny: I play astronomia if I'm gonna die
 Cappefra: just went 520 -&gt; 300 -&gt; 50 -&gt; 200
 Cappefra: I shouldn't watch it, it will give me false hopes
 DollarAkshay: You gotta pray to RNGesus
 cegprakash: same here Cappefra
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm only moving up
 BenjaminUrquhart: and I don't want to touch it
 BenjaminUrquhart: not even actively submitting anymore
 Peudoki: right now legend is also people spam submitting and praying to RNGesus
 DollarAkshay: I went all the way to Gold #80 and dropping slowly XD
 thethiny: I'm gonna submit
 thethiny:&#160;:(
 BenjaminUrquhart: 76 people are current submitting
 thethiny: I beat my arena code 
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool boost my rank kthx
 eulerscheZahl: 77
 thethiny: everytime
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl it's called a race condition
 BenjaminUrquhart: no stop, I'm supposed to be going up, not down
 dbdr: nice start eulerscheZahl
 RustyCrown: i no longer have any idea what my code is doing lol
 Peudoki: lol who writes code they understand, that would be weak
 WINWINWIN: Exactly Peudoki
 Peudoki: mine is now 1200 lines of a clusterfuck of random ideas
 eulerscheZahl: i can top that with 1500 lines mess
 WINWINWIN:  Mine is 223 lines
 WINWINWIN: :D
 RustyCrown: oh my god lol
 RustyCrown: how do you have so many lines
 Peudoki: well just a lot of time spent for me
 RustyCrown: i had like 800 at most i think
 WINWINWIN: They are in legend RustyCrown&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have 887, but that's nothing compared to my broken submit
 BenjaminUrquhart: which just barely topped 1k
 KnightMoves: I have 2695 lines 😅
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: :knife:
 Peudoki: btw are you KnightMoves from the TCEC chat?
 BenjaminUrquhart: MadKnight gave up?
 WINWINWIN: Yes, you are probably the longest KnightMoves
 RustyCrown: so your telling me more lines  = higher rating?
 KnightMoves: @Peudoki yeah i am
 Peudoki: exactly
 BenjaminUrquhart: no RustyCrown

 BenjaminUrquhart: there's also this monstrosity that displays my horrible endgame search<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467157135">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467157135</a>
 DollarAkshay: I will change my pac type if it is stuck in the same position for over 5 turns
 DollarAkshay: Lets see how this goes
 BenjaminUrquhart: I've had that for the past forever
 DollarAkshay: Currently Gold #110
 SabertheLost: Wow, I found a small bug in my code&#160;:) If there is corridor from spanning the entire length of the board and no walls at the ends. My code that check what the pacman can see just keeps looping: ) 
 Peudoki: ^^
 Peudoki: not the biggest issue
 SabertheLost: well it times out:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have a seed to test for that
 Peudoki: yeah but I assume maps like that are rare
 DollarAkshay: @SabertheLost I remember thinking about this edge case
 DollarAkshay: So i iterated only BOARD_WIDTH times
 BenjaminUrquhart: fixing it make little difference for me in terms of rank, it was just annoying to time out at seemingly random times
 BenjaminUrquhart: I just kept going until I came across a location that I already visited
 Peudoki: I iterate max(width,height) times because I can warp both ways xD
 BenjaminUrquhart:             while(this.read(pair) &amp;&amp; visible.add(pair)) {
 KnightMoves: what do you mean? you can't warp vertically
 Peudoki: true, I just didn't realise that when I wrote that code
 BenjaminUrquhart: my code can wrap vertically
 Peudoki: yeah mine as well
 Peudoki: they put all walls in row zero all the time so it doesn't matter
 eulerscheZahl: my final cheese isn't working :cry:
 BenjaminUrquhart: you didn't change your avatar to cheese
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's why
 eulerscheZahl: idea: if opponent starts with rock+paper, i'll do paper+paper for kill immunity
 eulerscheZahl: but the switch costs too many turns already
 eulerscheZahl: and now my rank is base-jumping
 Peudoki: thought of that too eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: not worth it according to my local test
 Csipcsirip: I still don't switch at all&#160;:
 ChooJeremy: I think that might be worth it but not on the first round, large pallets too important
 eulerscheZahl: also tried variations like: only if no more large pellets
 kovi: euler- tried that yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: and also not if more than 50% of small one harvested
 eulerscheZahl: with no success i guess, kovi
 kovi: yeah. switching is too costly
 eulerscheZahl: that was supposed to be my final cheese, planning this for a week already
 Peudoki: I never actually tried it, took the lazy route
 Peudoki: if someone makes it work then I look into it ^^
 kovi: i tried 4 pac switch as well
 Csipcsirip: funny thing that only psyho does. dont use speed immediately with some of his pacs, to confuse opponents detection
 kovi: and have speed advantage later
 kovi: tried that it didnt work
 kovi: (generally)
 Csipcsirip: didnt have time to try out ideas like that. could spend few more weeks on this :D
 Peudoki: jokes on them, I have no enemy detection anyway
 eulerscheZahl: wtf
 eulerscheZahl: you are in top10
 BenjaminUrquhart: imagine knowing where the enemy is
 eulerscheZahl: tracking the opponent allows you to avoid a lot of unnecessary paths
 Peudoki: it's not that I have nothing, but nothing so fine that would get confused by off cycle speeding
 Peudoki: pretty much just keeping track of the whole circle they can possibly be in
 Peudoki: with no smarts to it
 eulerscheZahl: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: i have that too, keeping up to 150 possible locations with history
 eulerscheZahl: excluding some as i explore: there's a pellet? then the opponent wasn't there
 eulerscheZahl: and i detect if all opponents speed at the same time
 Peudoki: I should refine it based on the fact when I see pellets missing clearly eaten by the opponent
 Peudoki: but never got to that
 kovi: still no submit from karliso
 Gonny: not before 9:45
 ShannonNorris97: I last submitted like 10 hours ago. Is it worth submitting again even though I haven't changed anything?
 Csipcsirip: ofc. submitting is fun
 thethiny: hahahaha
 Gonny: what league are you in?
 Vadasz: :D
 thethiny: you will lose your score
 ShannonNorris97: I'm only in silver
 Gonny: def not
 ShannonNorris97: Ah I'll leave it then, wasn't sure if it'd knock me down or boost it, thanks guys
 dbf: also when you submit servers are slower =&gt;your opponents are nervous =&gt; you have more chances to win
 Gonny: lolol
 dbf: so don't give up and re-submit
 Gonny: on CG there's a bonus on having submited a while ago because you get pushed up by other people
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethinyyou can do it
 thethiny: I'm timing out all of a sudden
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethiny 
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh rip
 thethiny: whenever people submit
 thethiny: I time out
 Gonny: BenjaminUrquhart I thought you were going to bed
 Gonny: are you in bed?
 BenjaminUrquhart: does it look like I keep my word
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's not a good thing mind you
 Gonny: remember last time! You were already going to bed and kept coding in bed
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm literally just here starting at the chat
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm not touching the code
 Gonny: haha ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: you can check my last submit
 dbf: BenjaminUrquhart why you are not touching a code if you still can submit?
 BenjaminUrquhart: because it's almost 3 in the morning
 thethiny: hahahaha
 Peudoki: I also coded from bed, fell asleep, when I woke up I was sure it is over as the clock showed 12 something
 Peudoki: came to check my rank and magically it was 7am instead
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80ffc2db-b123-45f2-a9d3-de88bdfbd0b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80ffc2db-b123-45f2-a9d3-de88bdfbd0b1</a>
 solaimanope: The clock shows 1 hour 17 minute left
 Peudoki: so I had time for a last submit
 BenjaminUrquhart: Last submit5/18/20 1:20 AM
 solaimanope: So, 40 minutes before the clock?
 eulerscheZahl: there are timezones...
 Peudoki: where?
 BenjaminUrquhart: EST here
 Peudoki: CEST here
 eulerscheZahl: CEST here
 BenjaminUrquhart: k
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's like actually day for you
 solaimanope: In my timezone, clock shows it ends at 2PM 
 BenjaminUrquhart: 4AM
 eulerscheZahl: wait, we are in the same timezone Peudoki? 8:45am?
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it's 7:45 for you
 Peudoki: I'm in Hungary right now because of the virus and stuff
 Peudoki: I'm a uni student, and you can do it from home right now
 eulerscheZahl: ah. i remember the hungary part. just wasn't aware that you moved backhome
 Peudoki: yeah I don't think I mentioned it before
 BenjaminUrquhart: top 10 is all C++
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 Peudoki: only said that I'm Hungarian and that this site thinks I'm in the UK based on the uni I gave and that I kind of live there now
 eulerscheZahl: i see java
 BenjaminUrquhart: I overlooked that
 eulerscheZahl: you can change your location
 BenjaminUrquhart: :upside_down:
 Peudoki: I'm not sure which one is proper to give in my situation
 Gonny: yeah tough challenge for Pythons
 Gonny: less than 10 in the top 100 I think
 Peudoki: I kind of use Hungary/UK pretty randomly in these situations
 eulerscheZahl: choose the right tool depending on the problem
 Peudoki: so when I got UK by default I just rolled with it
 BenjaminUrquhart: exactly 10 in top 100 Gonny
 kovi: i expect all hungarians loose to my bot to make me top3
 BenjaminUrquhart: solid plan
 thethiny: all these bug fixes caused me timeout now
 thethiny: RIP
 Gonny: haha
 BenjaminUrquhart: wait hold up
 WINWINWIN: When the final rerun happens, is the code in IDE or last submit used?
 eulerscheZahl: i wish you luck for top3 kovi
 Peudoki: I'm losing to Csipcsirip all the time I think
 BenjaminUrquhart: R4N4R4M4 OBJECTIVE C
 Peudoki: at least I used to
 eulerscheZahl: now that i accepted i won't make it
 Peudoki: that's my Hungarian contribution
 kovi: thx euler, considering ooc...well i hope for best
 Csipcsirip: yes I have 100% winrate against you Peudoki
 eulerscheZahl: you definitely deserve to be lucky after OoC
 Gonny: what happened to Kovi in ooc?
 eulerscheZahl: top4 was on par
 eulerscheZahl: guess who was 1st before the rerun and 4th after
 Gonny: oh damn
 BenjaminUrquhart: so uh
 BenjaminUrquhart: the only Objective-C submission is in legend
 Peudoki: is there a rerun?
 eulerscheZahl: :100:
 BenjaminUrquhart: they flexing
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes, top 100 get resubmitted
 eulerscheZahl: top100 players get about 1000 matches each
 eulerscheZahl: to stabilize the ranking
 Peudoki: nice
 dbf: it is sad that only top-100, not the full legend&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you start at your current position, no full restart
 Peudoki: that's good, my AI likes strong opponents
 dbf: ah, even no full restart
 KnightMoves: so if you are in the top 100 at the end of the time, you are guaranteed to get a top 100 placement?
 kovi: this is a game where most top likes top
 eulerscheZahl: for BotG i broke my rank 40 bot on purpose
 kovi: at least i had trouble in 20-40 range last days
 Peudoki: makes sense kovi
 eulerscheZahl: time check to only play strong in the rerun, start low
 eulerscheZahl: climbed from 98 to 73 i think
 kovi: lol
 eulerscheZahl: the rerun isn't enough to push you to your real rank but definitely helps
 dbf: why they can't do a full rerun like when league is created...
 eulerscheZahl: and that's how i sacrificed a good contest rank for science
 pde-bakk: how long have you legends been doing these contests/ working in this field, cus its looking like you are some serious veterans
 dbf: I can help them to trunkate table 'rank' if required
 Peudoki: my first contest here
 dbf: truncate
 Peudoki: it is a ton of fun
 BenjaminUrquhart: DollarAkshay :eyes:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/467207307">https://www.codingame.com/replay/467207307</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'm competing here for almost 4 years
 eulerscheZahl: and i studied comp sci and work as a programmer
 BenjaminUrquhart: this marks my 1st year anniversary of competing 
 Peudoki: I study maths
 eulerscheZahl: but this is different to the day to day job
 BenjaminUrquhart: still a student
 Peudoki: no work yet
 Gonny: oh wow I did not know that
 DollarAkshay: @BenjaminUrquhart haha yeah i just saw that replay
 eulerscheZahl: but let's get to the most important question: does that cat on your pic live in UK or Hungary?
 Gonny: so you do get an advantage being 20 rather than 50 at 4am
 Peudoki: Hungary
 cegprakash: bottom 10 in legend are very strong bots
 BenjaminUrquhart: I got freaking CoIF as my first contest
 eulerscheZahl: nice game
 Peudoki: I rent in the UK and no pets allowed
 eulerscheZahl: perfect information, sufficient depth, simple rules
 Peudoki: also I probably wouldn't want one there moving all the time and stuff
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 Gonny: 2nd serious contest for me after UTG
 eulerscheZahl: where i finished 1 above Gonny :imp:
 Peudoki: it's my third year living there and moved each year so far
 Gonny: haha indeed
 Gonny: doing the exact same thing!
 Gonny: only slightly better apparenty
 Gonny: but we literally had the same core everything
 Peudoki: damn my bot started losing like crazy
 BenjaminUrquhart: same
 Peudoki: bye bye top 10
 eulerscheZahl: i wasn't really motivated for UTG. somehow the game wasn't my cup of tea
 BenjaminUrquhart: and I didn't touch it
 eulerscheZahl: but for this contest i was really trying
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's almost like people are submitting better code
 Gonny: I'm still waiting for Karliso
 Peudoki: lost 10 out of last 11 games
 Peudoki: he is also too tired like me
 Gonny: Kovi is waiting for him more than me though
 Peudoki: Karliso?
 eulerscheZahl: submitted 5min before the contest ended last time. and won
 karliso: still coding...
 Gonny: hadn't seen him in the whole contest up to that point
 thethiny: woah nice
 Gonny: haha
 karliso: noidea where i land
 WINWINWIN: Awesome karliso
 eulerscheZahl: we have no idea either, let's see :popcorn:
 kovi: we have no idea where any of us land
 eulerscheZahl: good point
 thethiny: I fixed my bugs and yet again I perform bad
 thethiny: I swear the more bugs I make the better I perform
 kovi: except romka who is consistently top3
 thethiny: cuz bugs ruin my pathfinding, which means my pathfinding is bad
 Peudoki: to resubmit or not to resubmit
 Peudoki: that is the question
 eulerscheZahl: bb | !bb
 Gonny: this game is too random
 Peudoki: :D
 WINWINWIN: Peudoki Does it make a difference for you? the top 100 has a rerun anyway
 DollarAkshay: GOTTA PRAY TO RNGEsus
 Peudoki: I heard I start from my position though
 Peudoki: no idea how much it matters honestly
 Peudoki: as I said my first competition here
 eulerscheZahl: at the beginning you will quickly go up and down 5-10 ranks
 solaimanope: For Gold, the current rank will be the final right?
 Gonny: so if you resumbit at 3:59, chances are at 4 you're not top 100 yet, does that mean you get screwed?
 eulerscheZahl: then it slowly stabilizes
 Peudoki: oh okay
 BenjaminUrquhart: solaimanope once all pending submits are done, yes
 eulerscheZahl: but your starting position affects your opponents
 eulerscheZahl: you fight your rank +-5 i think
 Gonny: or do they start the rerun after all submits are done?
 Gonny: so at like 4:15 or whatever it is
 eulerscheZahl: after all submits are done + promotions
 Peudoki: too risky to try resubmit for me I guess
 cegprakash: how many games does each bot gets
 Gonny: ah  so you actually can submit at 3:59
 eulerscheZahl: expect the rerun to start 1h after the official end of the contest
 cegprakash: will it be ladder based or random opponents?
 eulerscheZahl: your first rerun cegprakash?
 eulerscheZahl: thank god they don't do that best of 5 on rerun anymore
 cegprakash: I never been awake for rerun
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's in the night for you?
 dbf: in highloadcup they had rerun for several days
 dbf: as a result - a lot of people have lost interest&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder takes weeks
 Gonny: weeks is a little over the top
 eulerscheZahl: for only 80 participants
 jrke: anybody suggestion to pass silver plz
 BenjaminUrquhart: win more games
 DollarAkshay: Avoid All bots
 sas4eka: jrke collect pellets as hard as you can
 DollarAkshay: use speed ASAP
 DollarAkshay: ignore switching
 BenjaminUrquhart: also Gonny I left my coding setup, so now I can't code anymore or be tempted to
 jrke: i am using speed and switch both
 DollarAkshay: I was able to get out of silver with simple dfs heuristic
 Gonny: good call BenjaminUrquhart
 eulerscheZahl: i'm desperately changing magic constats
 DollarAkshay: and JUST SPEED
 BenjaminUrquhart: I  A M  S P E E D
 BenjaminUrquhart: Automaton200 tell this man how to win
 BenjaminUrquhart: sam
 BenjaminUrquhart: same
 BenjaminUrquhart: Automaton2000 tell this man how to win
 Automaton2000: but i just like the challenge, but if i had a similar issue
 solaimanope: I am finishing one more contest in Gold. Legend is too tough for me&#160;:(
 kovi: karliso submit
 DollarAkshay: @solaimanope Same&#160;:(
 jrke: hey i am using speed and switch then why my rank 
 BenjaminUrquhart: the only multi I think I have legend in is CSB
 karliso: need to test some versions no idea
 BenjaminUrquhart: jrke try using only speed
 jrke: K
 DollarAkshay: @jrke are you avoiding enemy bots&#160;?
 jrke: hey if ability cooldown is 0 then i check if switch is needed then i switch else speed
 DollarAkshay: You dont need switch if you are avoiding enemy bots
 morning_cloud: looks like silver depends more on optimal pellet eating than any other strategy... Any tips on optimising pellet eating for higher score  :sweat_smile:
 BenjaminUrquhart: mad dash for super pellets
 DollarAkshay: @morning_cloud What stratergy are you using now&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: even legend is about eating pellets as fast as you can
 BenjaminUrquhart: assume every space has a pellet until proven otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: no fighting
 BenjaminUrquhart: euler I really want to remove switching from my bot now
 BenjaminUrquhart: good thing I can't code
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 DollarAkshay: @admin WHen is next contest&#160;? :P
 kovi: actually i tried few hours ago
 eulerscheZahl: i guess opponents in legend behave differently
 kovi: but it didnt make it to the top
 morning_cloud: @DollarAkshay first go for capsules, then the nearest pellet visible, I also keep track of previous pellets seen by any of my bots so they would go to them if no visible pellets are around
 eulerscheZahl: we don't attack if it's not a certain kill. so just having cooldown=0 is enough to defend
 dbdr: bottom legen also behaves differently from top legend
 DollarAkshay: @morning_cloud You know DFS&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I assume every empty space has a pellet until proven wrong
 morning_cloud: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i lose a lot against the bottom
 eulerscheZahl: always making it hard to climb
 DollarAkshay: Try running a DFS of depth 10 to find the rount which yeids the highest score
 dbdr: same
 kovi: except...when you learn enemy behaviour
 Csipcsirip: same
 kovi: which i didnt had time to implement
 BenjaminUrquhart: ceg already said bottom legend is underrated
 BenjaminUrquhart: DollarAkshay I'm still using closest pellet :P
 dbdr: that's not an easy one kovi. and the game is not very long to learn, if there are few opportunities in each
 kovi: for halite...i have added learning
 DollarAkshay: @BenjaminUrquhart You what&#160;? :scream:
 morning_cloud: @dollarAkshay ah right that's a good one :thumbsup:
 BenjaminUrquhart: closest pellet gang
 kovi: true. too few interactions
 jrke: is BFS needed for silver
 BenjaminUrquhart: some sort of search is needed
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh MadKnight arrived in gold
 BenjaminUrquhart: and idk where struct went
 dbdr: had 4 games running at once in my submit
 BenjaminUrquhart: is that a good thing
 dbdr: I guess it's busy time :D
 DollarAkshay: Gold is so weird. I loose to bots bwtween #450-#512 but do so well against #200-#300
 DollarAkshay: Weird
 BenjaminUrquhart: 139 computing
 BenjaminUrquhart: DollarAkshay leaderboards have been unstable since bronze
 jrke: when is next contest :thinking:
 BenjaminUrquhart: at most 6 months from now
 jrke: what!!!!!
 tomatoes: same code +/- 200 positions fluctuations :rolling_eyes:
 jrke: 6 months
 BenjaminUrquhart: welcome to the club tomatoes
 jrke: tomatoes same here
 DollarAkshay: @tomatoes Yeah I understand you
 eulerscheZahl: join legend. with less than 200 players you can't fluctuate that much&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: hush
 jrke: is there any other website with currently ongoing contest or coming soon
 Cappefra: thanks for the tip euler
 NickStahl: Can we expect some blogs/forum posts from various people explaining how they did things after the contest?
 BenjaminUrquhart: where's that site with all the contest listings
 DollarAkshay: I have a 16-4 streak agaisnt bots raked ~300 but i loose more than 50% againt bottom gold bots
 Cappefra: :angry:
 tomatoes: you may try old contests here
 DollarAkshay: The solution is to submit your code and leave it
 BenjaminUrquhart: NickStahl yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: there should be a forum feedback thread created shortly after the contest ends
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's where postmortems go
 NickStahl: BenjaminUrquhart tx. Will look into it.
 DollarAkshay: 10 losses in a row
 NickStahl: Writing spaghetti and not even getting too gold is getting old&#160;:)
 DollarAkshay: yaaayyyyy
 BenjaminUrquhart: so 10 people joined for the last hour of the contest
 jrke: 36  min left
 zarif98sjs: How will the final rank be calculated&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: for gold and below: all pending submits will finish, then it's final
 jrke: there will be mega run for top 100 of nearly 1000 matches
 eulerscheZahl: for top100 in legend: about 1000 extra matches per player to stabilize
 Cappefra: wait what
 Cappefra: I thought I had time to submit another one
 DollarAkshay: Winning streak lets gooooooo
 Cappefra: this one sucks
 BenjaminUrquhart: who wants to promote in csb
 BenjaminUrquhart: you technically do Cappefra
 eulerscheZahl: you can still promote after the contest ends
 Peudoki: you still have more than half an hour
 eulerscheZahl: if your pending submit is good enough
 Cappefra: but you're talking about when the timer ends right? not like right now
 Peudoki: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: and later (probably today already) the game will return to the multiplayer section. no prizes, infinite time
 Cappefra: ok ok
 Peudoki: we're all here for those sweet prizes obviously
 BenjaminUrquhart: not me
 BenjaminUrquhart: clearly
 Peudoki: not because it's fun
 jrke: lets do voting who will win the contest
 eulerscheZahl: my only motivation. i hate keyboards
 Peudoki: I vote for kovi, he was the leader for so long
 Csipcsirip: how do you type then&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: Oh an ew leaderboard is out
 eulerscheZahl: but i want that curved monitor to look at powerpoint presentations
 BenjaminUrquhart: speech to text
 DollarAkshay: Top schools and companies
 jrke: curved monitor to kovi or euler
 thethiny: submit time
 thethiny: I'm not gonna recover from this
 BenjaminUrquhart: nope
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't be like me
 NickStahl: eulerscheZahl What kind of programming do you do at Siemens?
 thethiny: I am beating Lord Betrayus 5-1
 thethiny: and myself 4-1
 BenjaminUrquhart: means nothing
 thethiny: why
 eulerscheZahl: internal software
 thethiny: lord betrayus keeps timing out
 thethiny: why
 BenjaminUrquhart: I can beat the boss and myself regularly, but I can't beat the stupid people in 500th place
 Cappefra: same as Benjamin
 thethiny: lol
 Csipcsirip: do you know the hungarian company evosoft&#160;? 
 Nerchio: same guys same :p
 thethiny: I'm gonna battle #2 then
 NickStahl: web or no-web?
 thethiny: and see
 eulerscheZahl: from analysis of electric streamlines for safety evaluation to a web project to administrate a list of materials
 kovi: csipcsirip, are you from BME?
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok why is my rank dropping
 thethiny: I can beat him easily
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 NickStahl: ah both&#160;:)
 thethiny: submitted
 Csipcsirip: nah, Széchenyi
 eulerscheZahl: and boring stuff like "i have data in excel, want to feed into another program that only understands XML"
 BenjaminUrquhart: so you have chosen... death
 kovi: too bad, we are all from different uni
 Peudoki: I'm from ELTE
 eulerscheZahl: mostly windows desktop
 thethiny: hahahahaahahahahaha worst idea ever
 Peudoki: well from LSE now, but ELTE before that
 aCat: with the submit?
 thethiny: I lost all the matches
 NickStahl: winforms?&#160;:)
 aCat:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: win forms, wpf
 DollarAkshay: The top 10 people in legend should form a fake company to get topp 100 company award lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: but like
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm pretty sure that's banned
 aCat: 1st company all top 100&#160;;]
 BenjaminUrquhart: on a side note, my school isn't even on the leaderboard cause I'm the only one out of 3 people talking it seriously :P
 aCat: but we got our uni fair :D
 DollarAkshay: All gold boys in one company&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: Gold .inc
 NickStahl: I guess I understand the need to look at powerpoint presentations then... probably from managers&#160;:)
 DollarAkshay: XD
 thethiny: my old submit wins against #500 peoplemy new submit wins against #100 people
 thethiny: why is the world like this
 BenjaminUrquhart: because
 eulerscheZahl: as you guys liked my stats on the last contest ( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.github.io/OceanOfCode/ooc_stats.html">https://eulerschezahl.github.io/OceanOfCode/ooc_stats.html</a> ), here's one for this contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/9BZx2wE">https://imgur.com/a/9BZx2wE</a>
 thethiny: now I'm 571
 Peudoki: this game is 100% random
 thethiny: I was 400
 thethiny: brb cry in the corner
 Peudoki: we're just better at pretending to be good at it
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's still 2.5k people in bronze
 BenjaminUrquhart: why is bronze always cursed
 SabertheLost: if this game was 100% random then you would not stay within 100 spots of your current position
 aCat: euler the image is great
 DollarAkshay: @eulerscheZahl :clap_tone1::clap_tone1::clap_tone1::clap_tone1::clap_tone1::clap_tone1:
 WINWINWIN: :D
 thethiny: @BenjaminUruqhart that's when the final rules are set
 thethiny: pretty much Silver is nothing
 NickStahl:&#160;:)
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl lol. I was wondering if you had found any interesting stats
 NickStahl: I should have seen that chart a few days ago, now it's to late to change my code :D
 Cappefra: there, resubmitting my old buggy boss which does better everytime
 aCat: he had :D
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm just trolling :D
 Peudoki: eulerscheZahl I need you to claim 8th place from me
 thethiny: @everyone do not submit anymore
 thethiny: you'll slowly die inside
 Peudoki: I'll hold on to your 7th
 BenjaminUrquhart: watch me /s
 dbdr: I considered making stats if people rather switch or counter, but never got to it. did not seem critical
 thethiny: your loss tbh
 BenjaminUrquhart: 174 computing
 BenjaminUrquhart: madlads
 eulerscheZahl: aagreed. didn't seem worth to collect stats
 thethiny: 173 computing in total
 eulerscheZahl: but pb4 asked for some winrates for his alternative ranking
 MSmits: wow what happened in the night, went from 30-40 to 83
 eulerscheZahl: good thing: i only have to look at last battles, not download all of them
 MSmits: I just resubmitted, hopefully not making it worse
 BenjaminUrquhart: leaderboard happened
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh you probably made it worse
 thethiny: I keep saying #2 in my last battles
 thethiny: seeing*
 dbdr: MSmits same code?
 MSmits: yes
 dbdr: why?
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits i was down to 20 too. pulled down, now back to 7 with little modifications
 thethiny: @Euler after the tournament is over can you share your code please
 MSmits: dbdr better start point
 BenjaminUrquhart: why would he do that
 thethiny: so we can learn
 dbdr: or worse
 BenjaminUrquhart: but
 BenjaminUrquhart: copy-paste
 eulerscheZahl: i would like to share my code. sadly there are some copycats
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but 83 is waaaaaayy lower than anywhere i got before
 MSmits: but yeah, might be worse
 MSmits: gamble
 thethiny: Will the same tournament repeat?
 eulerscheZahl: so there are some players willing to learn. and others claiming a top rank without even looking at it
 thethiny: or they never do?
 Peudoki: I can share my code so people learn how not to code
 BenjaminUrquhart: they don't repeat
 dbdr: sure, worth it MSmits. it seems you did not invest that much into this one anyways
 thethiny: then what's wrong with sharing code then, I don't seem to understand
 Cappefra: it'd be cool if the submit history kept track of the end-positioning
 MSmits: I did until around wednesday
 Cappefra: I hope I resubmitted the right one
 Adnmaster: aaaa 23 min left!!
 DollarAkshay: Can top 100 in gold please resubmit&#160;? Thanks
 MSmits: everythng stopped working after monday
 MSmits: i mostly failed though, it's not like i didnt try
 BenjaminUrquhart: DollarAkshay just get the boss to resubmit
 BenjaminUrquhart: easy
 thethiny: lmao
 thethiny: I can't believe all my bug fixes were for nothing
 thethiny: who knew bugs make things work
 BenjaminUrquhart: that happens every contest
 BenjaminUrquhart: every
 BenjaminUrquhart: time
 dbdr: MSmits what did you try to improve?
 thethiny: today morning I was like I won't touch this
 thethiny: now I did and look at my go down&#160;:(
 thethiny: @Lanfeust you need to resubmit
 thethiny: you may win
 MSmits: after monday, mostly predicting opponents, avoiding dead ends, hardcoding supperpellet targeting and some smaller things
 dbdr: I also failed to improve search. I went back to tracking, but only in the last hours
 zarif98sjs: How often does this type of challenge happen in here&#160;? 
 MSmits: at least twice a year
 MSmits: at most 5 i think
 BenjaminUrquhart: in other words, not often enough
 MSmits: often enough fo rme
 thethiny: what is coder strikes back btw?
 MSmits: ex-contest multiplayer arena open all year
 BenjaminUrquhart: the onboarding for multis
 dbdr: the nice thing with tracking is, if you deduct true information, it is almost sure to help
 MSmits: like other arenas
 MSmits: I did improve tracking
 dbdr: for search, it's much more uncertain what will work or not
 dbdr: and harder to reason about
 MSmits: I wrote a function that calculates the mandatory cells travelled between the last position of an opponent pac and the new position
 MSmits: it takes into account all the pellets that were seen on that path (and thus not travelled) and all the places the pac was not seen on specific turns
 dbdr: I have that too, also supporting split paths
 dbdr: but only if they went straight enough
 BenjaminUrquhart: I just get the shortest path between opponent and previous position and remove pellets
 MSmits: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: split paths are arbitrary though and I don't take into account how long they were gone fore
 MSmits: dbdr did you also do backwards elimination for pellets
 BenjaminUrquhart: for*
 dbdr: why do you mean by that?
 Adnmaster: is it allowed to use neural networks and train our pac to play?
 MSmits: so if you see a pellet on turn 30, you know it was alive on turn 20 and an opponent cant have passed through it on turn 20
 BenjaminUrquhart: Adnmaster yes
 dbdr: it's on my todo list :D
 MSmits: ah, thats one of the things that i did
 BenjaminUrquhart: keep in mind there are no NN libraries available so you'll have to roll your own
 dbdr: nice
 MSmits: the thing is, i never saw improvement form it
 MSmits: and that was true for anything i wrote
 MSmits: You lose motivation
 MSmits: I did test and it worked
 MSmits: btw, rank 39 now at 30%
 dbdr: you search using MC right?
 MSmits: yes, the search is the one thing thats good about my bot
 MSmits: it lacks too many heuristic stuff to deal with RPS and superpellets though
 Gonny: MSmits I've been doing the exact same thing
 MSmits: exact like what?
 Gonny: keep coming up with super smart ways to get more info but it just seems to be useless
 MSmits: ahh ok yes
 dbdr: I removed my specialized superpellet rusher to let the search find them
 dbdr: was better by deleting code&#160;:)
 MSmits: both ways seemed to work equally well dbdr
 MSmits: hardcoding and let search find them
 MSmits: i think my hardcoding was just bad
 MSmits: i just let them go for closest superpellet
 MSmits: way too simple
 dbdr: it was bettere for me because my rusher was ignoring things like enemies, or better path to get there
 Gonny: yeah I don't have a super pallet allocator either
 dbdr: it was very early legacy code
 Gonny: I just hope they are close enough to be in my depth, which is not too great
 BenjaminUrquhart:  dbdr my rusher only finds the closest super pellets, my search does all the heavy lifting
 MSmits: I could get my depth up real high and still find great paths, provided my opponent doesnt move
 MSmits: depth 12 easily... search was very strong
 MSmits: but without opponent prediction its useless
 dbdr: i search depth 15
 MSmits: wow nice
 DollarAkshay: Yeah same here
 MSmits: wait
 DollarAkshay: 15 on python
 MSmits: when you say depth 15 you mean 15 cells?
 MSmits: or 15 turns?
 DollarAkshay: 15 cells
 thethiny: I accidentally pressed submit again
 Gonny: same
 thethiny: kill me
 MSmits: I could easily search 12 turns
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethiny you're doomed
 MSmits: that includes speed
 BenjaminUrquhart: 12 minutes left
 dbdr: hm, depends on which version. but for the current one, 15 cells
 thethiny: yeah...
 BenjaminUrquhart: looks like I'm landing just above 300
 MSmits: ah then mine could go deeper, but as i said, its pointless, because opponent will stroll in and ruin your path
 LunaBread: is there any redo functionality in the ide
 BenjaminUrquhart: LunaBread define redo
 DollarAkshay: @thethiny For you&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4n1h1uig6E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4n1h1uig6E</a>
 DollarAkshay: :P
 chokudai: I need more time! X(
 dbdr: well, my search includes the opponent
 LunaBread: I CRTL Z some stuff and now I want to redo it
 thethiny: 😂😂
 BenjaminUrquhart: shift-ctrl-z
 MSmits: mine doesnt, well I floodfilled him and adjusted score
 BenjaminUrquhart: standard
 thethiny: @Doju i', mext tp ypi
 MSmits: if an opponent could get somewhere before me, the pellet would be worth less
 ChooJeremy: I thought ctrl-y is the standard?
 dbdr: ok, that's what I mean too
 BenjaminUrquhart: chokudai we all need more time
 ChooJeremy: for redo
 BenjaminUrquhart: I mean
 Gonny: MSmits I have that too but only for the first few turns
 BenjaminUrquhart: works for me across multiple platforms
 dbdr: I did try really simulating opponents, with some interesting results, but finally never switched to it
 Gonny: I mean next few turns
 pde-bakk: do i have to resubmit or will it happen automatically? Also I made some small anti-timeout changes but my score is currently computing, can I just click Submit again now?
 Gonny: did not really see a difference tbh
 Gonny: like most of the things I added
 MSmits: Gonny its hard to say what way works best... i never saw a difference from it either
 BenjaminUrquhart: pde-bakk you can submit whenever before contest ends
 MSmits: dbdr my live version does have real opponent prediction
 MSmits: it guesses where opponents can go with some assumptions
 pde-bakk: will scores automatically be recalculated at the end?
 MSmits: so i can avoid getting killed mostly
 dbdr: yay 4/10 HU flags in top 10 right now :flag_hu:
 MSmits: but its not very good and i still die a lot
 BenjaminUrquhart: pde-bakk top 100 get recomputations
 pde-bakk: ah cool thanks dude
 thethiny: recomputations for what?
 BenjaminUrquhart: everyone else is frozen once their submits end (if any)
 DollarAkshay: Imagine being top 5 in GOLD
 MSmits: seems my proper rank is 35-55
 MSmits: so resubmit from 83 was a good idea
 MSmits: someone chainsubmitted and pulled me down last night i think
 aCat: I'm top 5 in gold ;p
 aCat: but won't dare to resubmit :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: we had 3 people promote to gold
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool
 Cappefra: maybe to eliminate some of the randomness, the ranking algorithm should take account of the points difference rather than just a win-lose
 dbdr: wait until the rerun for your real rank MSmits. could be even better&#160;;)
 RoboStac: Cappefra - that'd be much more random
 thethiny: my new submit looking good wut
 DollarAkshay: chants: " RESUBMIT...RESUBMIT...RESUBMIT...RESUBMIT..."
 thethiny: what happens if im computing and the time isn't up?
 BenjaminUrquhart: welp, my rank got decimated
 BenjaminUrquhart: reee
 MSmits: I'm hoping for &lt;50 but it's ok. I'm just glad it's over. Not blaming the game or creators btw. Just did not have much success. 
 thethiny: then it becomes up
 BenjaminUrquhart: it finishes
 dbdr: aCat why not? at least you'd get a last change&#160;;)
 Cappefra: @RoboStac you think? most time you lose against a weak bot it doesn't destroy you, it just wins by a slight margin
 thethiny: you mean it continues or halts
 BenjaminUrquhart: continues
 thethiny: okay cool
 aCat: I'm afraid I can go much lower
 dbdr: does it matter much though?
 MSmits: anyway, i have some work to do. Busy day. all the stuff I postponed due to contest&#160;:)
 aCat: but I don't know what strategy is better
 dbdr: cost/benefit analysis time
 MSmits: ttyl
 DollarAkshay: The boss is actually 28.49 and #2 in gold is 27.21 ... a whole point away
 Nerchio: oh some people fed the boss so hard
 Nerchio: he was like 26.5 yesterday
 aCat: I'm rather hoping for push
 AntiSquid: the boss was 26 only lol
 DollarAkshay: @aCat Nice rank 2 gold
 aCat: yep
 aCat: :D
 MoMaT: aCat, you're so close, but so far...
 aCat: pray
 AntiSquid: people mindlessly submitting  because of the RNG lottery
 dbdr: other top gold ppl please resub to give acat a push&#160;:)
 thethiny: 😂😂😂
 MoMaT: VilBoub was your chance but he is loosing momentum...
 BenjaminUrquhart: stop submitting, you're knocking me down smh
 dbdr: entropy is your friend
 DollarAkshay: Bretrayed by Lord Betrayus
 aCat: yep
 aCat: pleaaaase
 BenjaminUrquhart: 5 minutes
 BenjaminUrquhart: better make the most of it
 aCat: this cat is very nice and helpful to you all
 aCat: :P
 DollarAkshay: Last 5 minutes guys
 Peudoki: 4
 F0lio: is it enough for a new push?
 MoMaT: OK, wait aCat, solaimanope is trying now.
 aCat: oh no
 BenjaminUrquhart: F0lio go ahread
 F0lio: I mean this last 4mins
 JohnCM: haha just did a resubmit
 aCat: not him
 DollarAkshay: RNGjesus is super strong in the lst 5 minutes...RESUBMIT now or .....
 JohnCM: XD, nothing to lose anyway
 ChooJeremy: I should have starting benchmarking with cgbenchmark earlier
 BenjaminUrquhart: you can submit all the way until the end
 ChooJeremy: who knew it would take so long lol
 aCat: probably the only one in top  I got more loses than wins :P
 F0lio: Hhhh Xd
 RavenKZP: @aCat ii'm with you&#160;:)
 Chkoupinator: I give up
 Zaphus: is the final ranking where you are when the clock hits 0, or does it continue to run for some time to settle things down?
 BenjaminUrquhart: it continues
 Chkoupinator: been trying to fix this error for eons 
 RoboStac: yeah, timer just stops you submitting code / accessing the ide
 RoboStac: positions won't be final for a few hours after that
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok who wants to submit in CSB really quick and promote the entire bronze league
 F0lio: CSB?
 Gonny: ouh Karliso submited!
 Zaphus: I made a minor change an hour ago, jumped from 450th to 195th in Gold - but I suspect that is more due to others resubmitting, the change wasn't that great!
 solaimanope: What's CSB?
 BenjaminUrquhart: coders strike back
 BenjaminUrquhart: Zaphus same here
 BenjaminUrquhart: except my last submit was 2 hours ago
 MoMaT: nothing better than last minute submission drama...
 DollarAkshay: Why are we talking about CSB?
 karliso: Gonny I submitted 3 times already.
 Zaphus: I suspect my change is worse, but it's too late now&#160;:-)
 Adnmaster: as i know all the bot programming games come after a contest, and others are allowed to play it again, is this gonna be like it?
 jrke: its a min now
 thethiny: I know my change is better but I don't see it
 DollarAkshay: 60secondssss........
 thethiny: 60
 BenjaminUrquhart: DollarAkshay because CSB is a contest's worst enemy
 JohnCM: woohoo exciting
 DollarAkshay: 50
 Gonny: oh haha didn't see karliso
 thethiny: 50
 jrke: 50 sec
 jrke: 45
 aCat: magic push?
 thethiny: 40
 jrke: 40
 DollarAkshay: The time to fix bugs is now
 aCat: I will be good cat from now on, I promise
 DollarAkshay: JK JK
 Illedan: Change random param and push :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: MAKE MORE BUGS
 thethiny: 30
 jrke:&#160;;)
 Adnmaster: 30
 AntiSquid: lol this is too random
 thethiny: 20
 NickStahl: GL on re-run for all top100 legends!
 jrke: 20
 DollarAkshay: 15
 BenjaminUrquhart: quick someone crash gold boss
 jrke: 15
 aCat: sola probably legend
 Cappefra: I feel this is gonna be the wildest re-run ever, if the randomness is even close to the submitting one
 thethiny: 10
 karliso: Yeah, I think I do reasonably well against top players.. but I can't get there.
 DollarAkshay: 9
 jrke: 10
 DollarAkshay: 8
 dbdr: nice Illedan :D
 DollarAkshay: 7
 jrke: 9

 jrke: stop
 Nerchio: the site exploded

 BenjaminUrquhart: -3
 BenjaminUrquhart: -4
 BenjaminUrquhart: -5
 Quidome: gg all
 thethiny: resubmit time for top 100
 thethiny: good luck
 Gonny: what happens if I click that submit button now?
 Adnmaster: good game to everybody
 Gonny: oh it kicked me out
 BenjaminUrquhart: Gonny error
 thethiny: hey I was watching
 DollarAkshay: RIP
 JohnCM: gg
 ToshiTuringMachine: hey i didnt save
 Gonny: alright bed time, good luck everyone!
 BenjaminUrquhart: 189 computing
 Cappefra: so what's the time estimate for the leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: error 404
 BenjaminUrquhart: few hours
 AntiSquid: fall challenge
 DollarAkshay: RIP CPU's
 thethiny: my Compete tab shows (1)
 Durkin: woot woot, glad to have done it, glad that it's over xD
 thethiny: but I can't click on it
 DollarAkshay: Calsh of Code guys&#160;? XD
 thethiny: ohhhhhhh
 thethiny: new contest
 Adnmaster: will it compute again, or will the current leaderboard be accepted?
 BenjaminUrquhart: site died

 thethiny: fall challenge 2020
 Adnmaster: where can we see the results?
 solaimanope: how to see the Gold boss's current score?
 ToshiTuringMachine: end of the year woooot?

 Illedan: 189 in submit :D
 DollarAkshay: Its not final for top 100
 DollarAkshay: Rest all is final i think
 BenjaminUrquhart: aaaaaaand signups are broken
 dbdr: no because of submits in progress

 dbf: thanks
 jrke: hey new fall challenge
 BenjaminUrquhart: "5 CodinGamers have registered to this contest"
 Durkin: Wonder what the next contest will be, hope to god no fog
 BenjaminUrquhart: inb4 the entire game is fog
 drykberg: god damn it... got to bronze last night, placed 2012, then worked whole morning to implement abilities half-heartedly, clicked submit 5min before end, and was placed 2227
 jrke: 16 registered
 DollarAkshay: dbf you are in legend league XD 
 Quidome: registerd for fall challenge :D
 DollarAkshay: Why are you asking for leader board
 thethiny: inb4 Euler spams the new contest
 Durkin: Its the reverse engineering puzzle in contest form benjamin
 solaimanope: Will someone qualify for legend still?
 eulerscheZahl: END OF THE YEAR 2020TO BE CONFIRMED
 RoboStac: they can do
 BenjaminUrquhart: Durkin no
 solaimanope: if he beats the gold boss?
 dbf: what is a gold boss score?
 eulerscheZahl: that's months away&#160;:(
 thethiny:&#160;:(
 Adnmaster: i hope this contest will be optimization
 AntiSquid: that's fine
 AntiSquid: need a proper break
 DollarAkshay: it was 38.5 when i last saw it
 dbdr: time to catch up on multis eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: two contests back to back like that and hidden info&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i'm indeed missing some now
 DollarAkshay: What multi's are we doing guys&#160;?
 tobk: bah, lost 50 ranks in the last half hour...
 BenjaminUrquhart: um
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't have the same motivation as for contests
 AntiSquid: i have a long list of to do multis
 JohnCM: next contest is end of year
 JohnCM: haha
 JohnCM: quite fun this one
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, try miniraic once it is announced
 Chkoupinator: I feel like commiting sudoku tbh
 BenjaminUrquhart: what multi should I do
 eulerscheZahl: on my list already dbf
 Chkoupinator: I spent the last 20 minutes trying to fix a dumb bug
 Cappefra: the re-run after all submits are computed is only for the top 100?
 thethiny: how do we know our scores in the competition?
 Chkoupinator: and I couldn't submit my new version
 solaimanope: Is there any way to see Gold boss's current score? Seems like I am on the second rank in gold
 eulerscheZahl: last one was fun. even if i wasn't happy about their recalc at the end
 Cappefra: so basically the gold league leaderboard will be fixed in like 10 minutes from now?
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethiny you'll get them soon in the completed tab under compete
 BenjaminUrquhart: Cappefra basically
 eulerscheZahl: planned round robin, screwed up and played random matches. way less than for a full round robin
 BenjaminUrquhart: unless someone promotes in CSB
 Cappefra: lol what does csb have to do with anything?
 Nerchio: solaimanope boss has like 28.5 pts? :D
 tobk: my last submits yesterday evening took ~30 minutes, but yes, fixed soon
 AntiSquid: is strategy and feedback thread up already?
 Cappefra: is that a meme or something? I see it mentioned so often
 thethiny: @BenjaminUruqhart mention me again, the previous one didn't turn red
 thethiny: I wanna see
 DollarAkshay: I think the first 10 people who registed fro Fall 2020 shoudl get a prize :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: because there's tens of thousands of players on hte leaderboard
 solaimanope: Nerchio I have 27.5. It's a longs shot, but I want to keep hope.
 AntiSquid: true DollarAkshay :p
 eulerscheZahl: when someone submits in CSB and pushes down the boss, there's like 500 promotions at once
 eulerscheZahl: slowing down the whole website
 thethiny: hahahaha
 RoboStac: solaimanope - you can see boss on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/solaimanope">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/solaimanope</a>
 Cappefra: oh ok hahahaha
 AntiSquid: someone quickly do a CSB submit
 Cappefra: that's good trolling
 thethiny: 568/4976
 thethiny: my rank
 thethiny: 😢
 BenjaminUrquhart: 283/4976
 Cappefra: is your submit over thethiny?
 DollarAkshay: Imagine betting Rank 404 with PHP
 thethiny: I don't know @Capperfra
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm still being pushed around though
 thethiny: it was at 8% when it kicked us out
 DollarAkshay: getting*
 Cappefra: oh then no way

 thethiny: okay 
 thethiny: thanks 
 eulerscheZahl: random gif <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2hGeE8b">https://imgur.com/a/2hGeE8b</a>
 Cappefra: I'm at 87% still hoping for a tiny push forward
 solaimanope: RoboStac I can't load the address
 AntiSquid: maybe yolo submit wasn't such a good idea :thinking:
 BenjaminUrquhart: Magus and Illedan already replying
 eulerscheZahl: magus already hitting enter
 Cappefra: idk Antisquid, if you're there at 27% chances are you're gonna end up top or mid-gold
 eulerscheZahl: he's always one of the first to answer
 Cappefra: which you already were, right?
 Magus: it's not like i'll make a very long PM when i'm just 35th
 AntiSquid: well it was 90th in gold this morning Cappefra :D
 DollarAkshay: Well atleast I am #3 in India
 Cappefra: oh&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i lose about 1k - 2k CP if i fail submit
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm top for my school cause I'm the only one that actually participated
 DollarAkshay: Was too busy playing chess instead of concentrating on improving my botr
 eulerscheZahl: "I didn’t find any good solution to handle the fog of war. So my code just don’t handle it. If an opponent pac is not in my inputs, it does not exist for my code."wow
 BenjaminUrquhart: I mean
 MoMaT: Nerchio, gold boss is at 28,13. it will be though, but not impossible!
 DollarAkshay: @eulerscheZahl who said that&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm pretty sure most people did that
 eulerscheZahl: magus on the forum
 thethiny: yes I saw lol
 RoboStac: eulerscheZahl - I do that too 
 DollarAkshay: And he made it to legend&#160;? :O
 eulerscheZahl: tracking is essential to remove pellets
 m01: is it possible to get hold of my code after the competition has ended?
 eulerscheZahl: you can avoid useless paths
 DollarAkshay: WTf @RoboStac you are top 10 without tracking enemies&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 DollarAkshay: MONSTER
 Magus: i never find a working solution
 Magus: everything i tried was worse
 eulerscheZahl: you don't need the perfect solution
 solaimanope: what's gold boss score now?
 AntiSquid: anyone tried OOC style tracking?
 DollarAkshay: @solaimanope 38.3
 eulerscheZahl: but in some cases you can tell the opponent position with 100% accuracy
 Magus: but the beamsearch works fine for farming ;D
 eulerscheZahl: i do that too. but less depth
 RoboStac: interesting how you did beamsearches for each move getting deeper, I didn't think of that
 eulerscheZahl: and running twice with reverse order of my pacmen
 Cappefra: honestly I'm baffled, I implemented tracking, whenever I see an opponent for the second time I assign every pellet on its last path a 0.1 score (cause most times I can't be 100% sure of the path it took)
 Cappefra: I treat last known positions that aren't older than 3 turns as if there was still an enemy there to avoid escaping behind a corner and then coming back to die
 Cappefra: and all that stuff made my bot DO WORSE
 solaimanope: So, my submission has ended 27.58 in GOLD
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like you are getting too shy that way
 thethiny: 577 is my final rank
 NovaHorizon: Nicely done, solaimanope
 thethiny: oh people still computing below me
 thethiny: RIP
 DollarAkshay: @solaimanope yeah you are #2 in gold
 Quidome: gold submits not finished yet
 DollarAkshay: Just below boss
 Cappefra: I killed a bunch more and died a bunch less but apparently the exploring got bad because of it
 NovaHorizon: How do you know if yours is still being computed?
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=ALL">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=ALL</a>
 DollarAkshay: You can see it in leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: red circle for pending submits
 DollarAkshay: Ther will be a circle next to rating
 Uljahn: sort by score:computing
 Nerchio: im glad this one is over lol
 eulerscheZahl: my rank goes skydiving again :cry:
 ClosetAI: No contest until fall, this could mean 3 total in 2020
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud already announced that CG will host less contests
 eulerscheZahl: and no more community contests
 unixmonster: can you still play that thing in like a practice mode?
 Cappefra: does anyone know what's objective-C performance in relation to C++?
 DollarAkshay: @unixmonster After a day or two yes
 solaimanope: next contest on which month?
 eulerscheZahl: yes unixmonster. the game will return to the multiplayer section soon. probably today already
 Cappefra: I might go objective-c next contest
 eulerscheZahl: date for next contest isn't decided yet
 DollarAkshay: @solaimanope People were saying its near the end of the year
 unixmonster: gotcha.
 unixmonster: Thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: next AI contest will probably be mini RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: on aicups.ru
 eulerscheZahl: it's all russian but google translate works surprisingly well
 DollarAkshay: Nice
 DollarAkshay: When is it&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and they allow international competitors too
 MSmits: ooc got thrown in unplanned. Companies pay CG to organize contests that the community can sometimes join. There's a chance we'll be able to join earlier. Just come in every once in a while
 MSmits: and play a cool boardgame while you're here
 eulerscheZahl: not announced. i expect it in 2 months maybe
 NovaHorizon: mini RAIC?
 eulerscheZahl: or create your own contest and suggest it to CG
 eulerscheZahl: mini raic: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aicups.ru/">https://aicups.ru/</a>
 unixmonster: also... is there a way to have multiple files?
 DollarAkshay: On CG&#160;? Nope
 eulerscheZahl: and a contest match: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aicups.ru/session/661598/">https://aicups.ru/session/661598/</a>
 Cappefra: Has CG ever explored the idea of pay-wall contests? I'd pay something to join one if that meant having more of them
 eulerscheZahl: click here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sityp0">https://prnt.sc/sityp0</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there are private contests. hackathons for companies
 Nerchio: eh its one of those games euler :p
 eulerscheZahl: but most of the time they are less interesting than official contests. this pacman game was a unique idea. hackathons are often (not always) variations of existing games
 GlitchyByte: This was a pretty awesome competition.
 MindControler: Will Spring Challenge legend league codes be resubmitted?
 eulerscheZahl: final leaderbaord will probably be copied to the multiplayer section directly
 eulerscheZahl: no full resubmit, just a copy
 jrke: when and where we can see final leaderboard 
 jrke: its my  contest first here
 Nerchio: java temporary #1
 Nerchio: impressive
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard</a>
 Cappefra: it's almost final for you jrke. The final recalculation is only for the top100
 jrke: K
 jrke: thanks
 semera: game is over, can somebody share "movement resolution" code? My code was either crazy slow or there was some issue in my simulation. Collisions of several pacs was unclear for me how to evaluate it...
 SemChumboPT: damm I was so bad at this spring contest&#160;:-(
 Durkin: hah! paper.io contest from the russian one, yeah I'll definitely bite- thats sounding like a blast
 Cappefra: there's only one person still computing in silver and one in gold
 Cappefra: after that it's all about the legend guys
 AntiSquid: oh 85th gold in the end, better than this morning
 AntiSquid: still 201st is bad overall :D
 thethiny: why can't we play previous contests?
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/detective-pikaptcha">https://www.codingame.com/contests/detective-pikaptcha</a>
 AntiSquid: you can
 thethiny: how
 BenjaminUrquhart: they're puzzles now
 Cappefra: we can but you have to look for them in the right section 
 BenjaminUrquhart: that one is a solo puzzle
 Cappefra: type detective pikaptcha in the search section and you'll find it
 BenjaminUrquhart: also I have a bad relationship with that game please no
 AntiSquid: thethiny look at the top of the CG website and find the search bar, type in the title of the game you are looking for (contest title in this case) and search
 Cappefra: I had fun with the quidditch one
 thethiny: I found it now as episodes
 thethiny: thans
 thethiny: thanks
 Cappefra: it was so much easier than ooc or this one though. I made gold in 2 hours there
 WINWINWIN: I never made Gold -_-
 jrke: hey same here
 AntiSquid: nice table Illedan :p
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan where did you get that CG sticker?
 karliso: Is it just me .. or the competition level was super high this time?
 eulerscheZahl: i felt the same karliso. strong competitors
 AntiSquid: CG sends those stickers if you host local codinghub for their contests eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: and some other advertising stuff
 Magus: you can also have some of these sticker if you won a contest :D
 AntiSquid: competition was high but also randomness on the ladder
 Magus: i got some stickers when i won fantastic bits
 eulerscheZahl: well, that's some tough conditions :D
 AntiSquid: so hard to assess correctly the strength of others
 Illedan: I got it from streaming eulerscheZahl
 Illedan: Do you want 1?
 Illedan: I have many
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 AntiSquid: i still have some too
 AntiSquid: hard to find enough people to give them to
 eulerscheZahl: shipping cost would exceed the sticker cost a lot :D
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm not a sticker guy
 AntiSquid: you would be a recycling recipient, doing my bit to save the planet
 Marchete: congrats to the winners!
 AntiSquid: Marchete&#160;?!
 AntiSquid: why didn't you participate
 eulerscheZahl: Marchete!
 eulerscheZahl: haven't seen you for a while
 MattSOrme: be interesting to read the postmortems
 Illedan: Hi Marchete! Did you fix all your C# bots as they broke C#? :P
 jrke: after a long time going to improve my csb legend bot&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/10">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/10</a> MattSOrme
 Marchete: broken again?
 Marchete: man :D
 wlesavo: rerun
 Marchete: I was completely out for weeks
 eulerscheZahl: we have .net core now
 AntiSquid: completely out&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: so your mono runtime optim isn't working
 Marchete: noice, net core is powerful
 AntiSquid: stuck on a cruise ship Marchete&#160;?
 Illedan: Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.systemdoesn't work Marchete
 eulerscheZahl: and release mode for c# submits
 eulerscheZahl: debug mode for the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: i'm crashing like dbdr :D
 Marchete: I mean .net core have a lot of optims
 Marchete: so you wont need Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.system
 Illedan: True, but most of my bots do now crash
 Marchete: I imagine
 eulerscheZahl: release mode! no need for runtime optims anymore&#160;:)
 Marchete: I was at quarantine, but not on the mood to code anything
 kovi: gl everyone
 eulerscheZahl: it started
 Marchete: like ... zero lines, just coding at work because I need to
 Marchete: ahh no
 Marchete: that wasn't the real recalc?
 Marchete: it starts now?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Illedan: Starts now
 Illedan: contest ended 30 min ago :P
 Marchete: sorry for saying congrats
 Marchete: euler, prepare to go down as usual :D
 Marchete: I saw you 1st some days ago
 eulerscheZahl: i was hoping for top10&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, 1st on saturday
 eulerscheZahl: long ago, i'm a has been
 eulerscheZahl: and the cow is overrated i think
 eulerscheZahl: ah, going down already
 BALEK: C# environment will be .net core soon&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: C# is .net core already
 eulerscheZahl: they changed that directly before the contest
 Marchete: you know, most people have had more time for this contest
 Skril: good luck to all&#160;:-)
 Marchete: btw recurs_e?
 eulerscheZahl: is relocating and has no time
 Marchete: ah
 eulerscheZahl: maybe no motivation either, dunno
 BALEK: oh nice, the FAQ is not updated yet
 MattSOrme: BenjaminUrquhart your strat for colliding forgot the best one. Stubborn! just keep pushing the grid either they give up, or you both go a pac down XD
 BenjaminUrquhart: k let me add that then
 jrke: this was easier than OOC but it doesn't matter  because the level of coders was so high
 Marchete: I think I don't have many C# bots fortunately
 eulerscheZahl: my OOC is broken
 AntiSquid: i think there were simply more people jrke
 eulerscheZahl: using system.drawing to debug images tehre
 eulerscheZahl: would have to remove that
 BenjaminUrquhart: MattSOrme added
 eulerscheZahl: falling already, i might not even be the first toad&#160;:/
 thethiny: I just got the achievement submit your code 10 times in the IDE
 thethiny: hmm???
 AntiSquid: watch legend completely change, ranking lottery is on! Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i guess i'll try to improve the bot
 eulerscheZahl: multiplayer games don't count for that submit achievement
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if bug or feature
 thethiny: okay
 thethiny: thanks!
 AntiSquid: looks like full legend recalc, 117 people, not 100 max
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethiny
 eulerscheZahl: no i won't join your clash. god damn it
 jrke: all legends are eveluating
 Marchete: there isn't any alternative to Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.system?
 thethiny: 😂
 BenjaminUrquhart: what part of I can't code do you not understand
 thethiny: I was trying it
 dbdr: no, you're crashing more eulerscheZahl :P
 AntiSquid: solaimanope stuck right below boss
 eulerscheZahl: indeed. they run the whole league. i've seen that differently
 BenjaminUrquhart: rip solaimanope
 AntiSquid: improving earlier does mean a lot
 eulerscheZahl: crashing?
 eulerscheZahl: show me a replay to prove that
 dbdr: &gt; (10:35:26 AM) eulerscheZahl: i'm crashing like dbdr :D
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 dbdr: did you mean in the ranking?
 eulerscheZahl: crashing more than you? that's an achievement
 eulerscheZahl: was in the context of IDE matches
 dbdr: ah ok :D
 solaimanope: I can hear the coffin song playing.
 solaimanope: What was the gold boss score in the end?
 solaimanope: I can't find it.
 ntroPi: ~28
 eulerscheZahl: 28.40
 AntiSquid: i want to read chokudai's post mortem, how do you get legend in less than 1 day, #1 PM by far imo :p
 eulerscheZahl: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/467279114">https://www.codingame.com/replay/467279114</a>
 solaimanope: Ok. That was fair I guess.
 wlesavo: AntiSquid not sure we will get it
 solaimanope: Would have hurt more if I were second with very close score :p
 eulerscheZahl: japanese community is active on their blogs. i think there will be a post mortem. just not in english
 WINWINWIN: When does it open as a multi?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I assume after legend submit finishes
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know but i think in 7h
 ClosetAI: There are some japanese tweets <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/chokudai?lang=en">https://twitter.com/chokudai?lang=en</a>
 dbdr: top 2 to 4 within 0.02 :D
 eulerscheZahl: will history repeat?
 dbdr: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce."
 jrke: its going to be tough call top 10
 AntiSquid: "The one that kills by sandwiching between two bodies" www
 Nerchio: i just realised you could do moves with pacs out of order?
 Nerchio: so like pac 3 then pac 1 :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 eulerscheZahl: moves are in synx anyways
 Nerchio: makes sense didnt use it though lol
 eulerscheZahl: sync
 ntroPi: does the order have game impact?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I threw everything into a set so no defined iterations order :P
 wlesavo: Nerchio they move simultaniously though
 NovaHorizon: I don't think the order has game impact
 Nerchio: yeah i guess
 Nerchio: i didnt understand this game xD
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/1262293438583549953">https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/1262293438583549953</a> this is basically a PM
 ClosetAI: Looks like 2-4 places are decided by pure randomness
 BenjaminUrquhart: not like I can read it
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok so now
 BenjaminUrquhart: sleeeeeeeep
 Nerchio: YannT bot was very similar to mine maybe a little more fleshed out in some parts
 AntiSquid: euler and his twin are very similar in rank, coincidence? :thinking:
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl, Illedan
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/edb9c13a-255e-4170-87b9-777b0ebb8ec7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/edb9c13a-255e-4170-87b9-777b0ebb8ec7</a>
 Marchete: just as a fast replacement
 AntiSquid: beamsearch was probably the most obvious first choice
 Illedan: thx Marchete
 Marchete: I'd say randomness is when players have +-0.02 or similar
 Marchete: 0.50 difference is not that random
 AntiSquid: you should have played to experience randomness of the contest first hand
 Marchete: btw Illedan, do you see .net core faster?
 Marchete: or it isn't noticeable?
 Illedan: Didn't do tests yet
 Marchete: when did they change it?
 Illedan: Same day as contest started
 Illedan: 1 day of 30% crashing bot at the start
 Marchete: oh wow, that's a risky move
 Illedan: Yeah, didn't allow my bot to stay 1st&#160;:(
 Marchete: I never ever, like not in my worst nightmares, would push such change along with smth important
 Illedan: And the motivation drained from that first day :P
 Marchete: well, still top 100, and 16th in the previous one, so gj
 MattSOrme: A player called FrenchKiss got into legen, but its bot has been crippled 
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: probably was bot hiding and overslept?
 AntiSquid: maybe he wanted a last minute submit but failed 
 Uljahn: or unlucky last minute submit
 MattSOrme: rip
 Marchete: was the contest fun?
 wlesavo: i think it was broken for quite a while
 Clagus: depends on what is your definition of fun :D
 Marchete: that you don't want to die at each key you press
 dbdr: that's a low bar :D
 dbdr: .
 MoMaT: why would you cripple your legend bot? maybe if you used someone else's code to get there and try to hide it...
 AntiSquid: marchete partially yes
 AntiSquid: i enjoyed it up to the part where i started submit spamming just because of random leaderboard
 Cappefra: @MoMaT but it got promoted to legend after the last submit...
 RoboStac: it was in legend yesterday 
 RoboStac: last submit was 3:12pm 17/5
 MoMaT: yes, so could have been changed after getting in. I don't think we can tell the promotion time...
 AntiSquid: you can change the bot in gold before promotion
 AntiSquid: once promotion is confirmed you can do whatever you want
 AntiSquid: you still get promoted :p
 MoMaT: good point. I didn't thought about that.
 MoMaT: FrenchKiss, explain yourself :P
 Dr-D: Jeha! Top 2000!
 MoMaT: AntiSquid, you had a great last minute submit, you should be happy!
 struct: javascript in top 20?
 MoMaT: I remember several contest that ended up badly for me...
 AntiSquid: i could have done much better, if i didn't waste time on submits lol
 AntiSquid: should have focused better on fixing my bugs
 AntiSquid: there are 3 bugs in my last submit that i am completely aware of btw
 MoMaT: true. but that's the fun part&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: playing ladder lottery&#160;? kinda
 MoMaT: tell me about it. my todo list is longer than the code...
 NickStahl: Lot of C++ only in the top, one lost Java player&#160;:)
 MoMaT: no, not the lottery, I'm not really saying *this* is good, but the thrill of watching your bot climbing up (and down)...
 AntiSquid: ya i guess mine is horribly long too
 MadKnight: i'm in gold this time
 MoMaT: that's the fun part of the contest for me. I can't muster the same enthusiasm for the multi...
 AntiSquid: wow MadKnight
 MadKnight: did u beat AntiSquid MoMaT&#160;?
 MoMaT: you've stopped taking part for some time MadKnight, good too see you back.
 MoMaT: depends how you look at it&#160;:) in ranking, no. he was like 100 places higher. but directly yes, his late submit actually improved my rank.
 KeshaDM: The previous contest was more understandable. This one for me: my bugs in code are competing with the others' bugs :grinning:
 F0lio: XD
 MoMaT: to much functionality, too little quality? I'd like to see some kind of "on the side" results with minimum code (the simplest idea) to beat each boss.
 MoMaT: I think it would be a great learning resource.
 [CG]Thibaud: I'll ask Maxime to share a few ideas. At some point in the contest, he was top 300 with 200loc
 eulerscheZahl: competition really improved the last days
 [CG]Thibaud: yup
 Uljahn: MoMaT: there is a postmortem for 300 LoC legend bot in kotlin
 MoMaT: thanks, I'll have a look.
 Peudoki: the French overtook the Hungarian kingdom in the end
 Doju: Oh is it fine to share code now?
 [CG]Thibaud: no. The game will open soon
 Doju: alright
 F0lio: Uljahn: what does postmortem mean? (curious)
 Doju: so it's just explanations
 MoMaT: "after death"
 F0lio: right, thanks!
 Uljahn: F0lio: it means a forum topic for discussing strategies and hints for specific contest
 F0lio: I see
 F0lio: im new
 F0lio: much to learn 
 SparshMc07: UwU

 Marchete: 300 LoC legend, I love challenges inside challenges :D
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr has about 10 lines i think
 dbdr: :innocent:
 eulerscheZahl: his file bundler is weird
 Marchete: how many, dbdr?
 dbdr: compressed or normal?
 Marchete: normal
 dbdr: 1.9k
 dbdr: that might include some non-fully used lib
 dbdr: ah, also that's the pretty printed version, longer than what I wrote
 eulerscheZahl: 1537 lines here
 eulerscheZahl: verbose for me
 Marchete: so, a normal bot :D
 eulerscheZahl: a boring bot
 Cappefra: 1.6k for me, I think 400 of which only for the hungarian algorithm to solve the super pellet assignment problem
 eulerscheZahl: you can bruteforce that :D
 eulerscheZahl: and: i should have do. was on my list but i totally didn't feel like it
 wereii: friend of mine shared the link two days before closing, didn't make it further then Bronze but I had around 400 loc and most of it were OOPzed components with one or two methods for the game logic xd (py3)
 eulerscheZahl: so sometimes i only get 1 superpellet
 dbdr: do you include the opponent in that?
 MSmits: hey Marchete
 Peudoki: same here euler
 MSmits: good to see you on chat
 eulerscheZahl: and we have a similar rank Peudoki
 eulerscheZahl: seems like i got you in the recalc
 Cappefra: I only include the opponent to assign half of the super pellets to me and the other half to the opponent in the first round
 Peudoki: I started so good in recalc
 Peudoki: kept ascending
 eulerscheZahl: but probably running out of battles before reaching robo
 Peudoki: then like last 25% bombed
 eulerscheZahl: and cow was 1st, now 10th already
 MSmits: imagine I was rank 83 when I woke up. Resubmitted, rank 40, now on recalc 34 currently
 MSmits: this is how random the game is
 eulerscheZahl: and karliso climbed a lot
 karliso: ... 
 dbdr: MSmits: non sequitur&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should have resubmitted before it ended
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/karliso">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/karliso</a>
 Cappefra: by bruteforcing I sometimes ran into situations where a pac went to the closest one even though he could have gone for the second one, and the second closest pac was farther away than an enemy
 MSmits: well done karliso
 eulerscheZahl: these stats imply that you should climb even more
 karliso: I feel dissapointed on multiple levels.
 MSmits: dbdr it's an example, not a proof. Plenty to go around&#160;:)
 Cappefra: so I treated it as a Munkres assignment algorithm
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 will make his alternative ranking when the recalc is done
 Cappefra: a bit excessive maybe but it worked
 eulerscheZahl: curious to see how different it will be
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, not sure if thats a good idea though... there's a very good chance it will give a different result
 MSmits: will breed resentment
 eulerscheZahl: that's the point: giving an idea about accuracy
 eulerscheZahl: and of course the alternative version isn't the "real" one either
 MSmits: I know
 eulerscheZahl: just showing possible discrepancies
 MSmits: I don't think accuracy is possible. At most you can say for someone in top 10 , your rank is  6 +- 3 or something 
 MSmits: for someone ranked 40, your rank is 40 +- 20
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still curious to see how similar or different the ranking will be
 MSmits: yeah me too
 Peudoki: we have 8-8 head-to-head eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: I just hope people won't complain too much
 MSmits: I won't
 MSmits: i just acknowledge the randomness
 eulerscheZahl: cgstats is incomplete as only the last 500 matches are shown
 Scarfield: i will complain, uuuu how i will complain! :p
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm collecting data already
 karliso: np, multi will open and I will be first.
 eulerscheZahl: we will see
 MSmits: karliso you may be
 MoMaT: dbdr got you good karliso.
 MSmits: I think I got the lucky end of the recalc though. Not the first time either.
 Peudoki: I think I got the unlucky end, but oh well
 MoMaT: it would be nice to see which games were lost by a unlucky corner turn kill, and which where really competitive.
 MSmits: peudoki, it's really hard to say. when you're submittign there are several distorting factors
 MSmits: 1) A submit is not long enough to stabilize so you need time after
 Peudoki: I'm between 10th and 20th either way I think
 MSmits: 2) sometimes a lot of people who submit are rock vs your scissors and you drop lower than you should, or reverse
 MoMaT: eulerscheZahl: could one extract that from server? I guess only for own games...
 MSmits: 3) when lots of people submit,they are lower on the ladder and your rank seems higher than it is
 MSmits: probably more things like this
 Peudoki: well I'm close to Csipcsirip who is rock to my scissors
 Peudoki: that hurts my recalc probably
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just opening the last battles of each player and counting the wins/losses vs each other
 MSmits: cool be yes
 MSmits: could
 eulerscheZahl: not by hand of course
 eulerscheZahl: but the data is publicly accessible. not like i try to get your stderr stream
 MSmits: two toads fairly near eachother on the leaderboard eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: but I think you'll be top-toad
 eulerscheZahl: the other toad got me at topcoder recently
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: so this is payback
 MSmits: eye for eye, toad for toad
 Doju: I think the last revision of my bot caused timeouts&#160;:/
 Doju: is there a way to see the games anymore?
 eulerscheZahl: CG is my home game. i lost the away game
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: Doju last battles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard</a>
 MoMaT: Doju, yes, from the ranking, click "last battles".
 MSmits: illeda n I would have expected to rank higher
 Doju: oh thanks
 MSmits: i didnt see him online so much lately
 eulerscheZahl: he wasn't motivated
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: well good thing he made legend at least

 eulerscheZahl: is that a general statement or does thibaud know something?
 MSmits: thibaud always knows things
 MSmits: anyway, gotta go do some teachin' 
 MoMaT: eulerscheZahl: you talking about the game results, I was wondering if you can get the gameplay data too. all the moves. this is needed to figure out the accidental deaths and measure how random the game really was. am I correct hat is only visible for your own games?
 jrke: hey new name for first ranker
 dbdr: stdout is public
 RoboStac: no, you can get anyones replays. the only private thing is stderr output
 eulerscheZahl: i even wrote an article how to do it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 eulerscheZahl: with code that you can run on the tech.io server directly in your browser
 MSmits: wait, did you guys realize, there's someone with a gerbil on their company name&#160;!?
 MoMaT: thanks RoboStac. I'll look into it then, maybe I can make some quick analysis.
 MSmits: how do i get a gerbil?
 MSmits: rank 36 on the recalc
 eulerscheZahl: do you want me to get a dictionary now?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean emoji?
 MSmits: yeah!
 eulerscheZahl: saw that
 MSmits: it's awesome

 ashelkov: challenge finished. now we gonna return to work and sleep a bit&#160;:) thx to all for participating. it was a nice time. :ghost:
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't matter. it's not like anyone would download chat history so we can look at it later
 dbdr: :innocent:
 Clagus: ashelkov &lt;3
 eulerscheZahl: congrats for doing so well in javascript ashikujjaman
 eulerscheZahl: ashelkov
 eulerscheZahl: bad tab completion&#160;:/
 ashelkov: thx! ive try hard
 eulerscheZahl: i think everyone at the top did
 Peudoki: I couldn't catch the toad in the end
 Doju: Also i spent some time making sure that i'll at least try to catch any errors
 Doju: then i left this on
 Doju: DEBUG = True
 Doju: xd
 eulerscheZahl: you'll get another chance next time
 eulerscheZahl: and you got 1 toad
 Peudoki: but cg shows 9-8 head-to-head so I can blame my feeder teammates ^^
 eulerscheZahl: cg stats is incomplete, only showing the last 500 battles
 eulerscheZahl: i suppose there were more, that are trimmed now
 eulerscheZahl: i downloaded the stats, still have to parse them
 ashelkov: i've fihting here not only for self but for all Javascript community:)
 Clagus: eulerscheZahl are you happy with top15?
 eulerscheZahl: not completely
 eulerscheZahl: but i think it's a deserved place
 Clagus: top1 German? :P
 eulerscheZahl: my bot wasn't that good
 eulerscheZahl: first in germany is normal. there's even another german in legend, which isn't normal
 Clagus: I think my bot was crappy, but I put a lot of time in it, and I'm pretty happy with 275th place :P
 Clagus: yeah, not a lot of Germans here
 eulerscheZahl: great. as long as you had fun and maybe even learned a thing or too, it was well invested time
 Clagus: yes, I think so&#160;:) I'm on CG for a long time, but it was first contest I put a lot of time in
 Clagus: it was also helpfull to talk with you guys here on chat
 eulerscheZahl: woah, you joined in 2014 already
 Clagus:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: when there were only 13k users
 Clagus: top 20 is dominated by C++
 MoMaT: eulerscheZahl: sorry, one more question. you seem to spend time on a "kill mode". is there any kind of corner kill (collision without vision from friendly unit) that you would consider non-random? I want to count the through unlucky deaths.
 SujalAI: Hey anyone there?
 MoMaT: *true
 RoboStac: I'm pretty sure some people were aiming for corner kills on super pellet routes (as they were quite predicatable)
 SujalAI: Now that the challenge is over can someone post their code
 eulerscheZahl: i did some corner kills: know where the opponent is (visible or by tracking), then move another of my units (not visible to the opponent) to the predicted cell
 eulerscheZahl: turned it off in my final submit, made some wrong guesses
 Clagus: hah
 eulerscheZahl: about where the opponent will go next
 MoMaT: OK, so I could maybe look at interception of the shortest unit -&gt; super dot paths as planned. would that make sense?
 Clagus: isn't that a lot of effort for something that could bring very little gain?
 eulerscheZahl: that path is hard to intercept. because then you would be even closer or at least as close to the super pellet as your opponent
 eulerscheZahl: i even give up on some super pellets when opponent has same dist but can beat me
 eulerscheZahl: lunch time
 Clagus: yeah, that's easy and actually is good
 Clagus: and I've seen a lot of maps with such situations, as if they were not random at all :D
 SujalAI: Can someone post their code
 Uljahn: SujalAI: the challenge will reappear as a multiplayer game in some hours, why ruin it?
 SujalAI: Uljahn when will that happen?
 SujalAI: I was going to continue my code today but the game is just gone
 Clagus: SujalAI you can't just come and ask people for hours of their work like that :P but if you need some help, you can ask questions
 SujalAI: How can I prevent my pacs from targeting the same pellet?
 Clagus: that's a good question! I implemented it myself actually
 SujalAI: I have an array with the location of every single pellet
 tomatoes: prioritize pacs
 SujalAI: What do you mean by prioritize pacs
 Clagus: I am calculating top 7 moves for each pac, and then I am selecting a field only for one pac
 Clagus: so if another pac already took it, it's not allowed for another pac
 SujalAI: Do I need to use speed for bronze or can i finish it with switch
 tomatoes: speed more important
 SujalAI: tomatoes Oh someone told me switch is more important :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Clagus: yeah, in bronze you can just use speed as soon as it is possible
 Vadasz: Will be there top10 resubmits, or this is the final leaderboard?
 RoboStac: this should be final, the recalcs happened
 SujalAI: I think I'll need to find out the direction of the pacs to use speed or else I might just run into an enemy
 Clagus: sometimes you will, but most times you won't :P 
 Uljahn: SujalAI: more hints for you (but no code, sorry) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113</a>
 SujalAI: Clagus can you give me some tips for defense, right now I'm just using switch when an enemy is close by. But this causes some problems when i'm under cooldown
 SujalAI: Uljahn I'm on that page right now
 Clagus: SujalAI you can always check your cooldown, and if it's not active yet, you can try to evade
 SujalAI: Clagus that's what i did
 Clagus: I'm actually mostly evading enemies
 SujalAI: Clagus I didn't evade the enemies
 SujalAI: I don't know how to implement that lol
 Clagus: if you can see enemy
 Clagus: and he is stronger kind
 Clagus: you can check if  his speed + your speed &lt;= distance
 Clagus: then you are in a danger zone
 SujalAI: How do I know which way to go, I only know the distance
 Clagus: I am check the distance to the field my pac is going to
 Clagus: and the enemy to the same field
 Clagus: if the enemy distance is more than my pac distance, then I will not collide with him probably
 Clagus: so no directions needed for that&#160;:)
 Clagus: I came up with that myself :P
 Clagus: probably isn't very smart, but still
 Clagus: it works in most cases so...
 Clagus: I like simple ideas, easy to implement, but powerfull in outcome - I'm too lazy for anything else :P
 Clagus: as Homer Simpson said: "if something is hard to do, it's not worth doing" :D
 Dipucian: can we add new languages~?
 Clagus: SujalAI - good luck with improving anyways - for me trying out new ideas is the fun
 Marchete: hello MSmits
 Uljahn: Dipucian: admins rarely add new langauges, they're more focused on supporting the existing ones
 Dipucian: is there anything we can help~?
 Clagus: just out of curiosity - which language?
 Uljahn: you could ask them on discord or on the forum
 Hvosten: I've started in groovy with simple algorith and I had many timeouts :D
 Dipucian: maybe unison~?
 eulerscheZahl: there were some problems with groovy this time
 _____snow_____: Is there anyone who made use of machine learning approach in the contest? maybe it can be used for designing evaluation metrics?
 Uljahn: doubt it
 GauravGosain: i need some help with a practice question, has anyone solved Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1
 BeardedWhale: GauravGosais, ask away
 GauravGosain: well the question gives just the direction as the input in every iteration but we have no array having the positions of the bomb how are we supposed to determine how many steps in that direction do we have to jump
 BeardedWhale: The bomb remains in the same position, so you must use all previous directions as clues to where it can be.
 BeardedWhale: You cannot figure out directly where the bomb is, you must rule out as many possibilities as you can with each jump
 PiterYeh: is it possible that using C# in the contest we had random 10ms hiccups, maybe due to GC?
 GauravGosain: oh thanks
 Uljahn: there is the hint in puzzle tags (binary search)
 GauravGosain: thx guys&#160;:) will try to solve it
 BeardedWhale: np, good luck&#160;:)
 Clagus: PiterYeh I had no timeouts using c# (after I fixed my structs to properly implement GetHashCode :P )
 IAmNoob: HI!!!!
 Clagus: PiterYeh but I wasn't really checking my execution times...
 wereii: @ernestvw what was the math behind clicks? tried to do it simple but meeh
 IAmNoob: What is that fall challenge 2020
 wereii: clinks*
 PiterYeh: i didn't implement GetHashCode but i didn't have any dictionary... sometimes time just kind of warped between one pac and the other, so i gave 0ms time budget to beamsearch and my pacs randomly walked around for one turn&#160;:( i couldn't find the problem in my code, so i thought maybe it was a C# thing
 IAmNoob: i dont belive they started another challenge
 IAmNoob: they are insane:))))))
 tomatoes: fall
 PiterYeh: Clagus were you using the full 50ms?
 HappyJoo: Estamos de volta com um material que achamos ser de bastante interesse das pessoas que querem seguir na programação Python. What's this language? Can't I change it?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: what's going on the chat?
 Clagus: PiterYeh probably not - as I said I didn't check that
 Automaton2000: when i tried it and it will get a lot more
 Clagus: I only checked my initial time (because I was timing out)
 MSmits: yay looks like i made 33 after all...
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 MSmits: big relief tbh
 IAmNoob: what is fall
 IAmNoob: thingy
 eulerscheZahl: fall = autumn
 IAmNoob: ok i know
 IAmNoob: is another contest
 PiterYeh: Clagus alright, thanks anyway
 IAmNoob: i mean
 Uljahn: it's not ready yet&#160;:)
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl bit sad you didnt get higher than 14. Is this unlucky or did you just get passed in bot strength in the last 2 days?
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea
 MSmits: yeah i should have guess, noone has an idea about this :P
 eulerscheZahl: saw myself at 6 today (with some submitting)
 MSmits: hmm ok
 eulerscheZahl: but that rank could have been luck as well
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I'll write a serious PM I think. I'm not near the top, but I think some parts of my bot are definitely top 10 worthy
 eulerscheZahl: then i dropped. and my bots isn't even worse against some players from the top than vs 10-20 range
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure if i want to write a PM or not
 MSmits: I'm curious about your search
 eulerscheZahl: beam search, one pacman after another
 Cappefra: I'm curious about the traps
 eulerscheZahl: then run again in reverse pac order
 MSmits: oh, i started with beamsearch... I got stuck on recursion
 eulerscheZahl: bruteforce traps
 Cappefra: or in generale about how top people implemented cooperation
 MSmits: i will share this Cappefra, my cooperation was definitely good
 eulerscheZahl: for each opp and pair of 2 own pacmen: where can opp go (list of cells)? then i move to limit these options
 eulerscheZahl: repeat until 0 possible locations (=kill) or cooldown=0 (escaped)
 eulerscheZahl: quite simple actually
 Clagus: yup, simple but powerfull
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Clagus: very cool
 MSmits: I did a full monte carlo sim
 eulerscheZahl: and i also put a null into my own pacmen. that way i do 1 vs 1 kills
 MSmits: with opponents as walls when they have advantage of type
 MSmits: a null?
 eulerscheZahl: and my bot thinking: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2hGeE8b">https://imgur.com/a/2hGeE8b</a>
 eulerscheZahl: nullptr
 eulerscheZahl: so that one pac is null and i only move 1 of my team
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: very different from what I did
 MSmits: a big thing I take away from this contest is the power of monte carlo
 IAmNoob: are there many people in CODERS STRIKE BACK legend?
 MSmits: I always viewed it as a poor man's solution if you dont know a better way
 MSmits: but thats not correct
 MSmits: IAmNoob yes
 IAmNoob: ok:(
 IAmNoob: i am now in gold and i thought i am one of 100
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should write a PM then. at least about tracking + killing. i'm just totally not in a mood&#160;:/
 MSmits: yeah, understandable
 JBM: just don't wiat until you forgot all about it
 MSmits: I'm in a better mood because i woke up at rank 83 :P
 eulerscheZahl: like my xmas rush post mortem, JBM?
 MSmits: you did that one really late?
 eulerscheZahl: which is still published soon
 MSmits: oh
 IAmNoob: Is there a contest or a challenge every season?
 JBM: possibly :D
 JBM: not yet
 JBM: only 3 to go
 IAmNoob: ok
 MSmits: IAmNoob nope, the schedule is erratic
 eulerscheZahl: in the past we had 4-5 contest per year. will be less frequent now
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: thx
 eulerscheZahl: next contest is planned for end of 2020. that's all we know
 MSmits: but honestly, you can get almost the same experience by having a group of likeminded people fight a multiplayer arena at the same time
 MSmits: happens all the time
 eulerscheZahl: or we create our own contest and suggest it to CG
 MSmits: pick an arena you like, talk about it here regularly and people will join, try to beat you at it
 MSmits: or that
 Marchete: except poker chip race
 Marchete: don't talk about it anymore
 SujalAI: Has anyone done code vs zombies?
 MSmits: heh, no PCR is in my past now, probably forever, with all the arenas available
 MSmits: SujalAI yes
 Clagus: why after finishing top300 I lost ranking points O_o 
 Clagus: I mean global account ranking
 RoboStac: it won't have been counted yet
 MSmits: check tomorrow
 Clagus: oh ok, I thought it was because in "bot programming" I saw increase
 MSmits: it's pretty expensive to recalculate a leaderboard of 2 million players, so they do it at night
 MSmits: Clagus other stuff happens every day, so that increase may have several causes
 Clagus: ok sure :P
 Clagus: yeah I've just checked in details, that was old increase :P
 MSmits: ah ok
 Clagus: I was just suprised cause I got new ranking today and it was lower than last ranking from March
 Clagus: that's why I asked
 Clagus: thx
 Illedan: hmm, what is wrong with PCR Marchete? :thinking:
 MSmits: he just spent too much time on it I think
 MSmits: but result is quite good
 SujalAI: MSmiths how do i prioritize Ash to target zombies close to humans?
 MSmits: I just did a bunch of random moves and calculate score based on that
 MSmits: then picked the best move
 MSmits: monte carlo
 MSmits: other than that, no heuristic rules
 SujalAI: But how can I proritize zombies close to humans?
 MSmits: your search gives score for surviving humans
 MSmits: so your search wont pick moves where humans die
 SujalAI: I'm just finding the closest zombie, but I want to chose a zombie if it's very close to a human
 PiterYeh: If CG is gound to host less contests, are you guys going to use any alternative platforms?
 MSmits: ah well you can calculate for each human what the distance to the closest zombie is and then walk to the zombie that is closest to a human
 MSmits: not saying this is the best way, but its a good thing to do to practice
 Nerchio: so they go away from community contests and then we will have 2 contests per year ^^?
 IAmNoob: The best thing in coders strike back are the fancy drifts
 Marchete: PCR simulation is sh*t
 Marchete: even with the referee is hardf
 PiterYeh: i'm not saying to drop CG, just wondering if there are alternatives in between CG contests
 Miarem: MSmits, now I'm free to wreck you at uTTT
 MSmits: hehe, good luck&#160;:)
 Miarem: pff... I have skill, I don't need any luck!
 MSmits: ah but when both players have skill, luck is the difference&#160;:)
 MSmits: I have to warn you... i am very lucky :P
 MSmits: for some reason luck gave me a 100% winrate as p1 vs you, karli so and re curse after all... :P
 Nerchio: Piter i think there is not that many contests unfortunately
 Miarem: we'll see, 3 elo pts is a big gap to cover
 MSmits: i would worry more about kar liso though
 MSmits: my bot beats him now because I broke his opening book
 MSmits: but he's in a league of his own compared to everyone else
 MSmits: my bot may match him,but I am not even sure of that
 MSmits: its funny how nagrarok got pushed up too
 MSmits: still strong after all that time
 Miarem: karliso, what do you code daily?
 Miarem: do you have anything to do with AI and similar stuff?
 Miarem: or is it just a hooby?
 Miarem: *hobby?
 MSmits: might be afk
 Quidome: Is the leaderboard final?
 Miarem: and what is most impressive about Nagrarok's commit. it's date  	04/08/2018
 Miarem: Quidome, yes
 MSmits: yes, he was nr 1 for a long time, i think like a year
 Quidome: Nice work MSmits 
 MSmits: what do you mean Quidome?
 Quidome: plaats 33 legend&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh ja, best tevreden, ben nu post mortem aan het schrijven
 Quidome: cool, zit op middelbaar onderwijs?
 MSmits: Ik geef natuurkunde en informatica, dus ja
 Quidome: Oh, ok, je bent docent&#160;:)
 MSmits: yep
 Csipcsirip: no rerun for the top10&#160;? 
 MSmits: there was a recalc
 MSmits: did you miss it?
 MSmits: it just does this for top 100
 MSmits: not top 10 specifically
 Csipcsirip: hm I thought there would be 1 more rerun only for those in the top10
 Miarem: i don't think it's possible
 MSmits: They never do that
 Csipcsirip: hm...okay
 MSmits: pb4 will do his own calculation to check, with a different system, to see if the order would be different
 MSmits: but thats not official
 Miarem: cause some of top-10 might get smaller score than 11th
 MSmits: miarem, they could solve that problem 
 Csipcsirip: yeah sure you're right
 MSmits: but they're not going to. It's not wise either, any recalc is going to keep the randomness inherent to this game. It would be sad for people who got nr 1 on first recalc, then nr 3 on second, or something
 Miarem: yeah, this one gone quite messy
 MSmits: it would only cause more contention about the end result I think
 MSmits: better to accept the result and move on. I think Saelyos is reasonably clear as a winner, but not sure
 MSmits: good enough
 MSmits: it's not 0.01 difference
 Miarem: yeah, i also see the flaws of the system
 Miarem: but i kind of enjoy them
 Miarem: it is a part of game
 MSmits: it's not a flaw of the system really. The system isn't perfect, but the game is just very random. With the game a given, an unbiased ranking system can't exist I think
 MSmits: you will always have situations where the nr 8 easily beats the nr 3, but the nr 3 easily beats 4, 5 and 6
 AntiSquid: MSmits hates the game
 MSmits: no i dont
 MSmits: i accept the randomness as a given 
 joelthelion: most intersting games are like that
 MSmits: I actually got the lucky end of it in my rank
 AntiSquid: do you think the game would be as random in outcome with 1 pac?
 eulerscheZahl: winrates that will be used to generate the alternative ranking: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/4Kxk7x2r">https://pastebin.com/4Kxk7x2r</a>
 MSmits: AntiSquid no it would be less random
 AntiSquid: or less pacs
 MSmits: or without hidden information
 MSmits: it would be less random then too
 AntiSquid: 5 pacs, tiny map, you basically calculate best options turn 1 if i am not mistaken
 MSmits: the first turns are super important there yeah
 RoboStac: 1 pac would be instantly over if you died on a corner
 RoboStac: which would be very random
 RoboStac: though I guess you could track better
 MSmits: yes, you could already sometimes guess an opponent would be coming around the corner
 kovi: back
 AntiSquid: well corner kills are also very random&#160;:/
 MSmits: yes, corner kills are the biggest source of noice
 MSmits: noise
 GlitchyByte: I didn't know about gaming the ranking the system. Boosting with promo. 1st time doing this. I was 50 Silver at some point. Could have left it at that and probably be boosted to gold. Instead I had to tinker and submit close to the finish line.
 MSmits: it's hard to say if you could actually have been boosted to gold GlitchyByte
 MSmits: depends on the rating difference mostly
 AntiSquid: lots got pushed to legend GlitchyByte :D
 MSmits: not the actual rank
 RoboStac: it's very unlikely you'd get boosted that far - it tends to just be people very close to the boss
 MSmits: yeah, normally it is. there is a large margin of error in some areas on the leaderboard though,  with lots of people with the same rating
 MSmits: but those tend to get pushed past the boss very quickly
 RoboStac: yeah, but that affects the middle much more than the top ends
 MSmits: whats left are people will bots clearly weaker than boss
 MSmits: with
 MSmits: true RoboStac
 MSmits: in legend middle, the error was +- 20 ranks I think
 MSmits: at top probably +- 3 or 5
 MSmits: gold it was +-100 for many 
 kovi: 20 for top...
 MSmits: well depends on what you mean by top and how many people are submitting at once
 kovi: true
 MSmits: you guys were all submitting at once, thats even more unreliable
 AntiSquid: got worse by the end MSmits, gold bots got similar in strength and between submits you could have 200 rank difference for some
 MSmits: yes, but +-100 is a 200 margin
 MSmits: it doesnt bother me too much, if you look at the whole leaderboard of 5k players,  better bots did clearly rank better. It's just a bit annoying for those that just missed something. Like a promotion or a prize
 eulerscheZahl: or the opportunity to sell their bot
 GlitchyByte: Ha!
 MSmits: lol, what?
 eulerscheZahl: got an offer to sell mine. ceg too
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: I've never gotten that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sipo2z">https://prnt.sc/sipo2z</a>
 MSmits: thats bad
 MonZtaDeluxe: wtf
 MSmits: did you report them to CG?
 eulerscheZahl: i told here to contact thibaud (and also shared that chat and a bit more on the moderators channel on discord)
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: she said banning them later wouldn't work
 eulerscheZahl: and then asked me to have my bot
 MSmits: it would have been a good idea to disqualify them from the leaderboard so they have no standing for their school
 MSmits: the opposite of what they were trying
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: no comment
 MSmits: I like how ceg responded
 Cappefra: granted that scholl thing is really happening
 Bob: lol, I say
 Stilgart: btw, am I the only one to have an increase of invitation for CoCs&#160;?
 Cappefra: yes
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 IAmNoob: yes
 Stilgart: ha nice
 Bob: you must be so popular &lt;3
 Stilgart: IAmNoob: at least, spent some time between two votes, it would be nice
 Stilgart: Bob: well, it will become "completely absent" if things goes on
 IAmNoob: Why
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i got a lot of CoC invites too recently
 Bob: I believe Azkellas's CG enhancer script can disable them
 CyberLemonade: is it from raghavachekuri?
 Stilgart: that's the last one (yesterday)
 CyberLemonade: yes he spammed me today
 eulerscheZahl: 8 invites in the last 11 days for me
 CyberLemonade: 5 since morning for me
 eulerscheZahl: you won :D
 CyberLemonade: :joy:
 IAmNoob: Stilgart why should i dont vote early?
 Stilgart: voting should be down after some reflexion
 IAmNoob: ok
 Stilgart: more than 10 votes in half an hour is not so good
 Stilgart: it makes me think that you don't even read the statement
 Stilgart: (note that I don't know what you really do)
 Uljahn: is it contribution related?
 Stilgart: yep
 IAmNoob: I do bro:))
 IAmNoob: why would i dont
 Stilgart: some in the past did not
 IAmNoob: I make my own solutions
 IAmNoob: for what i accept
 Stilgart: and some contributions with issues were accepted
 IAmNoob: there were minor issues
 Stilgart: having a solution is far from enough
 CyberLemonade: IAmNoob that's okay but often times the clashes aren't fun at all
 IAmNoob: I know
 IAmNoob: Stilgart
 Stilgart: I was thinking of contributions with major flaws
 IAmNoob: like:
 IAmNoob: put a link or something
 Stilgart: it is not among the one you accepted... I said "in the past"&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: aaaaaaaaaaaa
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 Stilgart: just keep in mind that, in the same past, fast multiple votes like this have led to mass refusal
 MSmits: I dont get invited much, did I turn of some notification or something?
 Stilgart: (we on #fr are good at mass refusal)
 MSmits: btw, I dont want invites... just in case you're wondering
 IAmNoob: Stilgart ok thx
 Stilgart: MSmits: I wish it were possible
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 Marchete: :rofl:
 wlesavo: even i got an offer of 200$ for my bot lol, different acc from ceg though
 IAmNoob: i would give the bot:)))
 IAmNoob: but at 500$
 struct: lol
 struct: wlesavo for the bot of this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: i got 2 offers: the one from ceg and javatar2018
 wlesavo: same scheme actually, but my kid was also crying that his parrents will kill him if he wont be in top 100 
 eulerscheZahl: who i can't find anymore, probably the nick changed
 MSmits: rofl wlesavo
 wlesavo: yeah, javatar
 wlesavo: thats the guy
 struct: 200$ for 12 days work
 struct: cheap 
 MonZtaDeluxe: there's a zero missing on the right side a guess
 cegprakash:&#160;:(&#160;:(
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 cegprakash: woke up to very bad rank
 cegprakash: this ladder system won't give me games against top guys
 eulerscheZahl: and we don't know if we would actually ever see the money
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/cegprakash">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/cegprakash</a> 
 wlesavo: i tried to give him some advices, but then i realised he uses euclidean distance, so he is probably quite far form top 100
 eulerscheZahl: how shall i click a link when you message appears the same moment i want to click wlesavo?
 wlesavo: lol
 wlesavo: clickbait
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl I had 60% win rate against 40-50 ranks
 cegprakash: but it didn't matter for CG 
 cegprakash: it gave me more games against bottom 20
 eulerscheZahl: recalcs can be painful
 eulerscheZahl: once i dropeed from 25 to 91
 eulerscheZahl: top50 = tshrit ranks, was already celebrating
 cegprakash: what
 cegprakash: top 50 t shirts
 cegprakash:&#160;:@&#160;:@
 wlesavo: which game?
 eulerscheZahl: coders of the carribbean
 wlesavo: painful indeed
 AntiSquid: where does it say anything about t-shirts?
 eulerscheZahl: for this contest? nowhere
 AntiSquid: ah ok 
 eulerscheZahl: and that's how you quickly spread misinformation by people only reading half the chat&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: ille only at 91 for this contest? thought he had a stronger bot
 eulerscheZahl: in the beginning. people improved
 AntiSquid: brutal legend
 eulerscheZahl: he confirmed having low motivation
 eulerscheZahl: and still beating most players
 AntiSquid: you defeated your clone
 Csipcsirip: :D
 eulerscheZahl: implying eulerscheZahl = Illedan? :D
 AntiSquid: no, that daiver guy
 Csipcsirip: the other toad I think
 AntiSquid: #22
 eulerscheZahl: my revenge for topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: where i got 17th and he finished 4th i think
 AntiSquid: did you enjoy this contest&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: at first: no
 Adnmaster: it was quite fun
 eulerscheZahl: when i got the idea: yes
 eulerscheZahl: not a fan of fog of war in general
 SunjiWa: Personally I preferred some other contests
 SunjiWa: like overcooked and hearthstone clones
 AntiSquid: felt more like a puzzle initially
 SunjiWa: hi from me
 AntiSquid: hi
 struct: I just hope someday we will get another physics contest
 eulerscheZahl: like overcooked and hearthstone clones
 eulerscheZahl: so =&gt; some
 AntiSquid: pacman 2 clone would have been nice imo
 SujalAI: has the spring challenge been made a game now?
 AntiSquid: soon
 AntiSquid: maybe this afternoon
 CyberLemonade: has anyone written a PM?
 AntiSquid: has anyone written in chat?
 eulerscheZahl: check the forum
 Uljahn: SujalAI: you'll get a notification when it's released i guess
 [CG]SaiksyApo: How did you liked pac-collision or would you have preferred pac overlapping resulting in shifumi fight when enemy&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Will the pacman clone (the multi submitted right before the contest)return&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: collision is fine
 wlesavo: AntiSquid will pacman contribution be released?
 eulerscheZahl: even if a little hard to understand with "human logic" sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: in the end i didn't even implement any collision physics in my bot. just avoided colliding with myself
 wlesavo: darkhorse64 damn, somehow thinked of the same thing just now
 eulerscheZahl: and kept bumping into the opponent. speed makes you lose 1 turn. switch gives the opponent the option to counter-switch
 eulerscheZahl: that multi was actually uploaded almost 1 year ago. made by jupoulton
 Uljahn: i'd like to have "look around the corner" ability :smiley:
 darkhorse64: I like the RPS thing, the collisions were OK as they are, I have mixed feeling for the fog of war. All in all, I fared pretty badly in this contest, so I may be biased
 AntiSquid: round the corner kills was the main issue imo [CG]SaiksyApo
 eulerscheZahl: you can deduct some info from details given (score, missing and remaining pellets)
 darkhorse64: My question was whether the multi can return for all
 AntiSquid: wlesavo you need to speak to thibaud, he told me not to share the game
 eulerscheZahl: but he didn't tell me and i downloaded it from squiddy's contribution :imp:
 darkhorse64: That's  totally understandable given the contest theme but now that the contest is over, it may be reconsidered
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know why it was created
 eulerscheZahl: a prototype for this contest? an internal hackathon for a company?
 eulerscheZahl: hacakthons can't be multiplayers for contract reasons
 AntiSquid: i think there was a diff reason darkhorse64
 AntiSquid: also it looks exactly like pacman except it's 2 players, 1 pac each
 AntiSquid: no fog, no RPS, ghosts are in there, damn it seems a lot of fun
 darkhorse64: I am OK with any decision taken it's just a question for CG. Is it OK for them or not
 darkhorse64: [CG]Thibaud: do you know anything about that&#160;? Can the multi return&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Yeah, it looks like the classic game, a nice to have thing
 wlesavo: also easy to implement a simple bot by cutting current one, so probably will have some attention and a little more players than usual community contributions
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm sorry, we prefer to keep it
 wlesavo: oh well, understandable i guess
 Astrobytes: I'm sure someone in the community could come up with something similar for us all
 darkhorse64: No problem, thanks for the quick answer
 Marchete: it's hacking time! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/bS5P_LAqiVg?t=607">https://youtu.be/bS5P_LAqiVg?t=607</a>
 kurto: can anyone help me 
 kurto:&#160;??
 AntiSquid: yes jesus can if you let him in your heart
 ShlOk: @kurto what happened??
 kurto: im stuck down a well
 kurto: i need to learn to code 
 kurto: really quick 
 kurto: i use python
 struct: why really quick?
 Astrobytes: To get out of the well, presumably
 ShlOk: @Antisquid i have a damn question for u. Last day u did not allow me to share links now that guy is sharing the link . Cant u tell him??
 Astrobytes: ShlOk AntiSquid meant clash invitation links
 Astrobytes: It's bad form to post those
 ShlOk: Who r u all to tell me bro??
 ShlOk: Protocol is for everyone
 ShlOk: Not only for selective ones
 wlesavo: dam Marchete now im watching kung fury
 Astrobytes: Dude, you don't have to share clash links, if people want to clash - they will join
 eulerscheZahl: legend is 114 players now. where did they go?
 Astrobytes: Any other non-clash links are fine ShlOk
 ShlOk: @Astrobytes dont change the point broo.
 Uljahn: clash links are dead in 5 minutes so that's spam
 tobk: collision was kind of weird though. in one replay had two of my own bots headbutt each other trying to kill another bot. needless to say the attacked bot in the middle did survive this...
 ShlOk: U also know i m right!!
 Astrobytes: ShlOk which part are you not getting here?
 WINWINWIN: Multi released yet?
 ShlOk: I know u all r experts!!!! But i dont want anyone to be bias on this website.:angry:
 Astrobytes: Later today probably WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:(
 kurto: how do i select only the initials of a name?
 WINWINWIN: python right?
 eulerscheZahl: FrenchKiss removed. and 2 others as well. spot the missing players
 Astrobytes: ShlOk - Dude. The rules are simple. no clash links. Most other links are fine. Where is the issue?
 WINWINWIN: name = input().split()
 WINWINWIN: initials = [ i[0] for i in name]
 WINWINWIN: This will give the initials as a lisk kurto
 WINWINWIN: *List
 Csipcsirip: will the contest return as a multi&#160;? 
 Quidome: I moved up 6 places, so 6 people aboce me removed?
 eulerscheZahl: soon
 AntiSquid: shlok / shiok that conversation was about not harassing people to join stupid clash
 AntiSquid: you can share links (apart from NSFW)
 Csipcsirip: nice
 Quidome: why are they removed?
 AntiSquid: 6 places where&#160;?
 thethiny: can someone send me the forums link
 thethiny: can't seem to find it
 WINWINWIN: 6 places in contest?
 eulerscheZahl: let me check...
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid I tried telling him :shrug:
 Quidome: i am 466 gold and I was 472
 WINWINWIN: thethiny
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/33">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/33</a>
 AntiSquid: it's not even about sharing clash link, he was telling everyone to join the clash now he is being a drama queen Astrobytes
 Quidome: sorry overall rating that is
 KonamiCode: yeah, someone got removed
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid I know, I saw him doing it 
 WINWINWIN: @Quidome, maybe some people are removed from contest because of what happened in the morning
 thethiny: thx winwinwin
 Quidome: what was happening?
 KonamiCode: mataranga was 70-something, now N/A
 Astrobytes: What happened in the morning?
 WINWINWIN: Some US college offered a prize to winners and to get that prize the students tried copy pasting
 AntiSquid: i was 201st, 3 got removed above me it seems
 Quidome: Oh, ok, interesting
 Astrobytes: FFS, real clever
 [CG]Thibaud: we kicked a few smurfs and people who shared code
 [CG]Thibaud: still deciding if we should kick the main accounts (who had smurfs)
 eulerscheZahl: kordmatarangaFrenchKiss
 struct: Thibaud you mean multiple submits with multiple accounts?
 struct: or smurf accounts with only 1 submit?
 MSmits: my massive PM is up
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah, sorry I mean "alt accounts"
 WINWINWIN: Does not seem possible to figure a smurf if it is multiple submits multiple accounts
 struct: Yeah I get that, but my question is, you ban people that used alt accounts + real accounts?
 struct: Like multiple submits per person
 AntiSquid: similar code i guess Winwin
 Astrobytes: I think that's what they're trying to decide struct
 Quidome: hm, this is not so funny
 struct: I think my wording is poor
 struct: let me see if I can explain my question :p
 darkhorse64: Anxious, struct&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: we kick the alts only not main accounts. And when code was shared, we kept the first player only
 MadKnight: [CG]Thibaud probably only legendary and maybe gold alts
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) darkhorse64
 struct: So Imagine you had a smurf and only submited on contest with that account
 [CG]Thibaud: yes MadKnight
 struct: That should not be a problem imo
 struct: But if you submited with smurf + other accounts
 struct: asure
 eulerscheZahl: 3 in legend removed: kord, mataranga, FrenchKiss
 darkhorse64: Only copy / paste if you improve
 Quidome: [CG]Thibaud thnxs for all the efforts!
 [CG]Thibaud: :heart:
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, highly appreciated
 AntiSquid: so alt until silver is ok&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: On top of that they also reached gold in the contest!
 WINWINWIN: Awesome [CG]Thibaud
 WINWINWIN:&#160;!!
 struct: darkhorse64 im not anxious, just wanted to understand, I did not compete in this challenge
 [CG]Thibaud: alt is never ok
 darkhorse64: struct: I am just trolling you :innocent:
 wlesavo: nice PM MSmits, thx 
 GauravGosain: hey guys :D 
 GauravGosain: im still noob at coding but slowly learning
 GauravGosain: this is super fun
 kurto: is it possible to learn python in 3 months? i seen a YT vid of a guy saying he got proficient enough for a job at google after 3 months of coding
 kurto: im still in a well
 Hjax: can you learn python in 3 months? absolutely! can you learn enough that google wlil hire you, unclear
 Hjax: google cares about more things than just how well you write code, they care about how you think, how you solve problems, etc
 struct: past experience also counts
 kurto: i can write a calculator using python, where do i go from here?i want to learn more
 struct: If he had previous languages knowledge
 Maciulis: did he learn to code from scratch or had previous experience in other language 
 Uljahn: i doubt you can learn python with all standard libraries in 3 months
 Marchete: and in 2 months?
 Uljahn: sure :smiley:
 Marchete: :D
 GauravGosain: if u have coded in almost any language before learning python is a breeze 
 kurto: is a 6 month python course going to bring me up to speed?
 Uljahn: it depends
 kurto: im fucking dumb
 kurto: but i want to improve
 Uljahn: improve in what? what's your goal?
 kurto: coding. make money from it
 AntiSquid: then do some android apps and insert as many ads as possible into them
 AntiSquid: make sure they are cash grab p2w
 AntiSquid: or be innovative and create something unique
 kurto: i mean i want to learn to code and get a job 
 kurto: currently i a dumb welder 
 AntiSquid: what kind of job
 kurto: backend developer
 AntiSquid: then pick a language for backend and learn that
 kurto: im doing that
 kurto: but
 kurto: as i said, i can code a calculator. where do i go from there?
 Astrobytes: Hey, being a welder does not make you dumb. Give yourself some credit&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: i don't think this is the best site to learn backend development
 AntiSquid: what Astrobytes says is very much true, there's lots of "IT" people that are dumb
 kurto: where can i learn to understand the flow of a code
 AntiSquid: hey i don't know best site for backend, but use google to find tutorials, alternatively use freecodecamp it teaches backend too
 Maciulis: go to job boards search for junior positions, analyze reqs get familiar with some of the tools used and apply 
 MSmits: yw wlesavo, I like writing them
 Maciulis: you will learn on the job
 Uljahn: or try to apply for internship
 AntiSquid: make sure to ignore junior positions that require years of experience, those are people trying to underpay you
 kurto: ive been doing that for 9 months
 kurto: i need to get past just being able to code a calculator
 AntiSquid: do their charity projects if you can't find anything better
 AntiSquid: and use that to show you have experience
 AntiSquid: or go freelance i guess&#160;? 
 Maciulis: there is not much of market for custom calculators
 AntiSquid: that's why i said he should search for tutorials if he wants to learn more, but the calculator project is just one of the many on that site, he stopped early
 Maciulis: try paid evening courses in your city, most of them advertise that they will help you find a job afterwards. Got to invest money to make money 
 AntiSquid: charity projects on freecodecamp (if they still have those) are free and you do real world stuff 
 Kellthazar: Anyone did the Monte Carlo Tree Search Exercise? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise</a>
 Uljahn: yep
 Kellthazar: So, could you help me? When they said: "Reading baa 30" why not create 3 nodes instead of one? root -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; a
 RoboStac: thats how basic mcts works - each time you search from the root you create one new node and then do a playout from there. Creating nodes for each move in the playout is very inefficient as you might never come back to this part of the tree (and usually the game is much deeper than 3 moves). 
 struct: My uTTT problem&#160;:(
 struct: I guess its simple enough to fix
 MSmits: oh nice, a mcts puzzle
 Marchete: try it, maybe you never heard about it :D
 Marchete: about MCTS
 Marchete: it's kind of interesting
 Kellthazar: RootStac, so, how to differ the "baa 30" playout from the "bbb 4" (first example)? 
 Kellthazar: By this statement "Finally, reading bbb 4 will create a new node on a path bb from the root, updating all statistics on a way to the root, so the root will have 3 visits, and b node 2 visits."
 Kellthazar: "create a new node on path bb"
 Kellthazar: I cant understand...
 RoboStac: each time you start from the root and follow your tree until you encounter a move you've not seen before. You then make a node there and backprop the score
 RoboStac: so the first line creates a starting move b as there aren't any nodes
 RoboStac: second line creates starting move a as you haven't seen that
 RoboStac: third time you already have b node so you travel to that and create a child b node on there
 MSmits: lol Marchete
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09ad409c-882c-4fab-8b12-31c33ff97437">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09ad409c-882c-4fab-8b12-31c33ff97437</a>

 Kellthazar: Thanks, RoboStac, I think I get it.
 lifetimeLearner007: Kellthazar, I meant like a game in CG website. Like we have past OOC, LOCM etc. Sorry, I wasn't clear b4.

 ZarthaxX: tooooooooooooooad
 eulerscheZahl: polar bear
 WINWINWIN: :D
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 eulerscheZahl: still your toad #1
 ZarthaxX: #2 in lb tho
 ZarthaxX: you gotta fix that issue
 WINWINWIN: He already did :D
 ZarthaxX: i see his second
 ZarthaxX: him
 eulerscheZahl: wait till tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: royale missed top100 in the contest
 ZarthaxX: oh..
 ZarthaxX: that's an f
 ZarthaxX: need to check that lb
 WINWINWIN: Anyone use sublime text?
 WINWINWIN: I tried coding offline and copy pasting but I am getting this error
 WINWINWIN: TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
 WINWINWIN: python3
 ZarthaxX: didnt sublime go pay to use?
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ I dont pay
 eulerscheZahl: i use atom
 WINWINWIN: It asks me to I just click remind me later
 ZarthaxX: weird, i got that problem in linux
 ZarthaxX: yeah i know that window  :P
 WINWINWIN: Never got an error till now :P
 ZarthaxX: atom is cool 
 ZarthaxX: doesnt vscode do the job anyway?
 WINWINWIN: But why is that error coming?
 WINWINWIN: TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
 ZarthaxX: did you google?
 ZarthaxX: ah that's a python error
 WINWINWIN: Says something about inconsistent spacing

 RoboStac: it means you've got both tabs and spaces at the start of lines
 RoboStac: so it can't work out the program flow
 ZarthaxX: structooo&#160;:*
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, thanks ZarthaxX
 WINWINWIN: Will just run a replace in python3 online
 RoboStac: the stub codes here appear to be space indented, so there might be a setting you can change in sublime to use spaces instead of tabs
 WINWINWIN: thanks RoboStac
 ashikujjaman: what is your code length for spring challenge
 egaetan: 2,5k
 Uljahn: i used some imports in python, should i count underlying code to? :thinking:
 ashikujjaman: @Uljahn NO
 eulerscheZahl: 1.5k lines
 BenjaminUrquhart: I used a number of lines
 struct: .13€ per line
 ashikujjaman: I am in silver an my code is 500 lines
 BenjaminUrquhart: struct nice JS bot btw
 struct: yes I got to bronze and never made a bot
 Uljahn: tutubalin was able to reach wood1 with 100 chars in js&#160;:)
 ashikujjaman: @eulerscheZahl may ask you which algorithm you have used?
 Uljahn: what is forum, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and as you can see
 Gonny: 1.5k too, too long if you ask me...
 struct: That seems a lot
 struct: 100 lines
 eulerscheZahl: beam search for path finding
 ashikujjaman: anyone  used AI (I am poorly know about AI)
 ashikujjaman: @eulerscheZahl thanks
 eulerscheZahl: storing a lot of nodes for possible locations for each opponent. removing some when i can exclude them (e.g. seeing a pellet =&gt; opponent hasn't been there)
 eulerscheZahl: bruteforce for kills
 Brokolis: In the rock-paper-scissors war puzzle, in the example there are 2 papers on the lowest row, however, I fail to see how
 Brokolis: It says that you can wage war on at most 4 fronts, so the top row C's would beat bottom row P's, making rows equal
 Brokolis: And then for 3 remaining rounds they would both mvoe one left
 Brokolis: How is it that there are 2P's at the end on the 2nd row?
 Brokolis: Nevermind, I am dumb
 Brokolis: It also goes left
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I think it's funny you started with MC but found it to work badly and switched to beamsearch and made it work well. I started with beamsearch and i couldnt code it properly and switched to MC which worked well
 ashikujjaman: does depth first search always go the maximum depth node 
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 BenWo: morning
 MSmits: ashikujjaman no it doesnt
 MSmits: it just explores the most recently added node first
 MSmits: but you might find a short path that way
 MSmits: it's just not guaranteed
 wlesavo: fun fact, my rank is exactly twice of my team rank 68 vs 34
 MSmits: I rank exactly 1 above your team :P
 MSmits: btw what is your team, company or school?
 MSmits: my school never got enough participants, though I was happy with Thiesjoo
 aCat: woah somone kicked from legend?
 ashikujjaman: MSmits I want to find a maximum length path where all node is 1can I do it with one dfs
 struct: yes aCat
 wlesavo: school, not many people had time to participate this time, last time we were 2nd
 aCat: less people now
 MSmits: oh, nice wlesavo
 MSmits: 2nd
 MSmits: ashikujjaman what do you mean 1?
 MSmits: node = 1?
 MSmits: you mean each node counts as 1?
 ashikujjaman: cosider a graph have all node 0 and 1
 MSmits: and you want to find the path with the most nodes?
 MSmits: hm ok
 wlesavo: but last time it was different because many people were only participating by company
 Scarfield: 0 = not visited, 1 = visited?
 ashikujjaman: no
 MSmits: so it's just a property true or false ashikujjaman?
 ashikujjaman: 1 not visited 0 visited
 MSmits: oh
 aCat: we defended #1 uni&#160;:-)
 MSmits: gj
 eulerscheZahl: aCat you might miss the following players:kordmatarangaFrenchKiss
 wlesavo: wow, pb already made alternative ranking post
 Marchete: well, wroclaw is a lot higher than 2nd place
 ashikujjaman: @MSmits can I personally message you
 Marchete: 38k vs 36k
 MSmits: yes
 eulerscheZahl: he's about to cleanup his script and then share that too. how the alternative ranking is done
 Anonymous_007: Anyone can  help me solved it C++?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm 14th in official vs 11th in alternative
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd and 3rd switched
 MSmits: ah, not too bad
 MSmits: was expecting worse
 eulerscheZahl: expect for 2nd/3rd, top7 is consistent
 aCat: not so much, they are  36.9

 MSmits: great
 eulerscheZahl: a toggle?
 struct: yes euler
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 wlesavo: ceg you shouldve keept a lucky submition before rerun started, anyway thats what i did, otherwise i would join you at the bottom
 MSmits: when do you aim to have it finished? Want me to take a look at it? I wont code an entire bot yet, but just at your description and the game rules?
 struct: 3 days
 MSmits: allright, warn me when i should be looking at it
 cegprakash: where is the ranking eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: where is which ranking?
 eulerscheZahl: the chart as text?
 cegprakash: it has 3000 lines
 cegprakash: u said alternate ranking
 eulerscheZahl: that's p1 p2 with winrate
 eulerscheZahl: this fine was used to generate the alternative ranking
 eulerscheZahl: so when you got lots of losses there, you will be at the bottom
 cegprakash: I did not even get matches
 cegprakash: I rarely lost
 MSmits: cegprakash it's sad you got stuck at low legend, but still quite an achievement to even get to legend. This is a big contest with strong competition. Well done.
 aCat: legeeend .....
 aCat: so near so far......
 aCat:&#160;;(;(;(
 MSmits: even top gold is not easy here aCat
 MSmits: not with 5k size
 MSmits: 150 gold  in this contest is equivalent to 50 legend in a normal contest
 MSmits: because 3x size
 eulerscheZahl: closer to 2x
 MSmits: depends, xmas rush was 1k
 MSmits: so 5x
 eulerscheZahl: and assuming that the new players are equally skilled as the veterans
 MSmits: i think it drew more good players as well
 eulerscheZahl: the topcoder guys were strong, no doubt
 MSmits: it's kind of weird, the last few contests went worse for me than the first few even though I think I got better. Maybe slightly less obsessed. Can it be the opposition is better than when i started 2 years ago?
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl did u invite them
 cegprakash: how did they get to know
 Insufficient: i found this website from errichto's youtube videos
 Insufficient: he is a strong competitive coder and active on a lot of the sites like topcoder etc
 MSmits: Insufficient how do you like CG so far?
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah he streamed a few challenges before
 MSmits: It's basically all i know
 cegprakash: MSmits u are probably better at working with non hidden information games
 [CG]Thibaud: he told me he hadn't the time for Spring Challenge this time
 MSmits: cegprakash could be true yes
 Insufficient: it's really great and different from other stuff i've seen, and it's a really nice mix of competitive programming and gaming in a way
 cegprakash: I am usually good with board games. That's why this rank is disappointing for me
 Insufficient: and it's an interesting community of people with different skills and backgrounds
 MSmits: agreed
 AntiSquid: what about the streamer i suggested [CG]Thibaud&#160;? were you worried you get too many participants? :p
 Marchete: a lot of hobbyist coders, like smits
 Marchete: a bit weird
 [CG]Thibaud: I lacked a bit of time
 eulerscheZahl: whom did you suggest AntiSquid?
 Marchete: but they are much better than others
 [CG]Thibaud: Ocean of Code didn't help
 [CG]Thibaud: Sendex
 MSmits: are you saying I'm weird Marchete
 MSmits: or is it weird that there are a lot of hobbyist coders
 MSmits: or both?
 eulerscheZahl: or do you want a lawyer?

 MSmits: I do prefer when the cells are visible a bit more clearly
 MSmits: unless there is a debug mode or something
 MSmits: In the other Y, the layout of the board is very clear
 struct: Ill see what I can do
 struct: I need to fix referee first before i go into design
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: take it easy
 struct: Thanks for the feedback
 MSmits: quality &gt; speed
 Marchete: I say it's weird a hobbyist outperforms 99% of paid coders
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well i'm weird too, so that would be ok
 MSmits: i'm not a total hobbyist anymore since i am studying to be a CS teacher
 MSmits: working on an AI class now
 MSmits: well i did everything in  4 days so i am mostly waiting for the test
 Marchete: you know what I mean
 MSmits: yeah i knoe
 MSmits: it is strange
 eulerscheZahl: you will forget all the content again till your exam
 AntiSquid: how many of them are coders and not just students / other kind of IT staff&#160;?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl 50% that was in the class i already knew, so its not that much risk 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm kidding
 MSmits: i know that too :P
 jrke: hey any body knows how to gain charge in OOC i just started OOC plz
 MSmits: oh, thiesjoo said he was maybe going to pick a CG game for his research project for the final year of high school
 MSmits: to test some search algorithm
 AntiSquid: euler this streamer <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ</a> and unlike codingbullet who has 2 million, he has far more useful content
 struct: MOVE DIR SKILL_TO_CHARGE
 MSmits: kinda cool
 AntiSquid: 2 mil followers i meant
 dbdr: codingbullet is entertaining, not informative&#160;:)
 jrke: what struct
 struct: you output
 AntiSquid: what would you call instafluff dbdr&#160;?
 struct: "move dir skill_to_charge"
 jrke: K
 jrke: thanks
 dbdr: who's instafluff?
 AntiSquid: a streamer 
 MSmits: it's the gerbil guy!
 dbdr: what's gerbil?
 AntiSquid: the one with clouds and plushies and balloons all over the screen
 AntiSquid: he has no gerbil lol
 MSmits: he did have a gerbil
 MSmits: sec
 AntiSquid: basically a rodent dbdr
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global</a>
 MSmits: rank 36
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: gerbil
 AntiSquid: maybe he is awesome streamer for kids
 SujalAI: is the pacman thing back
 AntiSquid: that's not the streamer though, it's one of his minions who follow him
 struct: Does the gerbil work on chat 🐹?
 MSmits: oh it's a hamster AntiSquid
 dbdr: wait, #36 is a logo
 MSmits: it's hamster guy
 MSmits: :hamster:
 AntiSquid: #525 gold
 AntiSquid: that's the streamer
 SujalAI: Is the pacman thing back as a game?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff">https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff</a> dbdr
 MSmits: then he got beat by his minion hamster guy
 dbdr: not yet I think SujalAI
 Uljahn: yes, for premium accounts
 MSmits: can you have a hamster in your name?
 dbdr: I just finished implemented two tracking features I did not have time for, just had to
 dbdr: so waiting for the multi too&#160;:)
 MSmits: ouch, i cant do that dbdr, i dont want to risk getting a bot that is much better, then regretting not coding it sooner
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: I usually don't
 PrivateBrocolliOfDoom_bb03: i cant even beat the art one
 dbdr: now it just felt right
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: Illedan always continues after hash code
 MSmits: after the deadline
 AntiSquid: MSmits it's more like a sorcerer conjuring a powerful demon hamster lol
 MSmits: I see
 dbdr: next step requires a time machine
 PrivateBrocolliOfDoom_bb03: im gonna do the labyrinth
 MSmits: good puzzle to learn from PrivateBrocolliOfDoom_bb03
 dbdr: that pseudo :D
 sha-man: guys, in the first thor puzzle, the position of thor in a given moment is equal to the initial variable&#160;???
 AntiSquid: well it is a super food MSmits
 MSmits: a hamster is?
 MSmits: dont think the hamster would agree
 AntiSquid: brocolli
 MSmits: o
 elderlybeginner: how to turn off editor suggestions?
 MSmits: sha-man, you need to update the initial position every time you output a move
 MSmits: otherwise it stays the same
 PrivateBrocolliOfDoom_bb03: i cant solve power of thor&#160;;-;
 sha-man: ohh....
 sha-man: jeez... wish the problem told me that 2 hours ago
 MSmits: it helps if you output error messages, they dont count as normal output
 MSmits: you can use this to debug and learn how the input/output system work
 jrke: when it will be released as classic game
 PrivateBrocolliOfDoom_bb03: temp
 sha-man: I thought the initial variable keeps updating as he moves :S 
 MSmits: no, the only thing that happens is that you are given input
 MSmits: everything else you have to do yourself
 struct: sha-man, only the stuff inside the while loop keeps updating
 struct: In some games this is the case
 struct: and some puzzles
 MSmits: so the input gets assigned to some variable, usually local, so you need to make it global or store it somewhere outside the loop
 MSmits: that is, if the puzzle gives new input over several "turns"
 MSmits: not sure what thor is like
 MSmits: too long ago
 BenjaminUrquhart: WakaTime: [weekly] report for 2020-05-11 until 2020-05-17 (no data)
 BenjaminUrquhart: sounds right
 MSmits: What's a waka?
 Hjax: the noise pacman makes when he moves around? wakawakawakawaka
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 MSmits: ohh true
 MSmits: wakawakawaka
 cegprakash: Bronze was too hard league considering tons of ppl stuck there. There should definitely be a Bronze II and Bronze I
 AntiSquid: so shakira is a pacman <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRpeEdMmmQ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRpeEdMmmQ0</a>
 AntiSquid: oh league divisions would be nice, but playing people only with 100 ranks range is also nice
 struct: Yeah
 struct: we need 100 leagues
 dbdr: 5k leagues
 dbdr: only remaining problem is the ordering of the leagues
 AntiSquid: no need if you only play people around your rank
 AntiSquid: much easier fix
 struct: Maybe 1 league per player?
 dbdr: ^
 AntiSquid: why just 1 
 AntiSquid: if you want a trainwreck do it properly
 eulerscheZahl: i want a single player. not bothering with other players in my match
 struct: Wow great idea, we should take with cg
 struct: talk*
 AntiSquid: FOW mitigation&#160;? what's that? zasmu mentions it in his PM
 eulerscheZahl: fow 0 fog of war
 eulerscheZahl: =
 AntiSquid: bloody acronyms ... 
 eulerscheZahl: damn TLAs
 eulerscheZahl: but i agree. i tend to spell out words when i'm not sure everyone will understand them
 eulerscheZahl: i even write coders strike back instead of CSB usually
 eulerscheZahl: at least when talking to newbies
 dbdr: single player, right. we could call it, I don't know.... optim?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds too competitive
 eulerscheZahl: almost like having leagues
 dbdr: puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah. let's have a puzzle contest. but without the time pressure thing
 eulerscheZahl: everyone is a winner
 Illedan: Anyone started to make a pacman Optimization yet?
 Illedan: 1-5 pacmans, clear the map as fast as possible
 Illedan: only movement
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 kovi: psyho will win that
 AntiSquid: contest wasn't far from that
 MonZtaDeluxe: is somehow the ide down?
 MonZtaDeluxe: or is it me only
 eulerscheZahl: someone wanted to make a code a la mode optim
 BenjaminUrquhart: contest ended MonZtaDeluxe if that's what you're trying to do
 Illedan: too wierd controls in calm
 MonZtaDeluxe: i'm in code4life game
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 Illedan: pac is just 1 cell moving
 AntiSquid: sometimes it breaks, you need to refresh MonZtaDeluxe
 eulerscheZahl: collisions?
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's talking longer than usual for it to load for me
 MonZtaDeluxe: (i refresh 3x already) nvm - i have my code offline so i will try later
 Illedan: make them simpler euler
 Illedan: let them move in the sequence of actions..
 AntiSquid: the viewer bugged a lot during contest 
 Illedan: only collide if the next is occupied
 eulerscheZahl: you mean no parallel movement?
 AntiSquid: maybe they should collect fluff instead of pellets too&#160;?
 JBM: no parallel fifths!!!
 SujalAI: Has anyone used ML?
 JBM: sorry flashback
 Illedan: parallell, but 1 by 1 on the same frame :D
 thethiny: is the link to play the competition for fun up?
 BenjaminUrquhart: not yet
 thethiny: thanks
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl has a contribution
 Illedan: if you wanna play
 eulerscheZahl: should be soon. announced for today
 BenjaminUrquhart: also the IDE died for me so that's cool
 thethiny: I'm tryna make an offline interface for brutaltester
 eulerscheZahl: i did a cleanup on my contributions :D
 thethiny: where you can convert the output json into replays
 Illedan: ah
 eulerscheZahl: you just have to start the webserver (part of the SDK) and place the json file in a folder where the SDK finds it
 thethiny: or you can load the frame and give it the json file
 thethiny: since replays are basically json loaders
 AntiSquid: huge CP boost tomorrow
 thethiny: the referee code already contains the js and assets
 AntiSquid: oh i failed once again to reach top 50, but didn't try as hard this time at least 
 eulerscheZahl: i think this time top50 was harder than usual
 AntiSquid: but i feel like i massively fucked up more than usual
 dbdr: indeed, only 50 people succeeded
 BenjaminUrquhart: such a profound statement
 struct: There are plenty of multies you can get top 50 easily
 struct: without any effor
 struct: t
 cegprakash: what are they struct
 cegprakash: someone cheated and beat me on country ranking
 cegprakash: I need to beathim
 Csipcsirip: lol dbdr
 wlesavo: first 68 succeeded
 struct: The ones that dont have 50 players
 GeekNbOne: Anybody has achievement not updated after a puzzle?
 cegprakash: here is my exact code that finds the best move I used in spring challenge<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sj4sck">https://prnt.sc/sj4sck</a>
 AntiSquid: so you have a random search
 cegprakash: yes for 23 ms I do random search
 cegprakash: followed by 23ms on mutations
 cegprakash: a validSim is a sim where I don't self collide
 cegprakash: because I don't know how to handle that in the eval
 Csipcsirip: why dont u just goto to the bottom of the while. goto is fun
 Csipcsirip: if(validsim) no fun
 cegprakash: haha
 Csipcsirip: you can make a matrix of occupied cell history btw. so you can exclude moves where you'd collide, instead of handling collision later
 cegprakash: I felt this was easier
 cegprakash: what u say might work
 cegprakash: but again
 cegprakash: u'll have to ignore many simulations
 cegprakash: oh wait..
 cegprakash: getRandomSolution function may be slow
 cegprakash: if we do what u say
 Csipcsirip: you should prune moves anyways
 Csipcsirip: not fully random
 SujalAI: Has anyone done code vs zombies?
 SujalAI: I'm stuck on split second reflex
 Csipcsirip: you can read what top players did back then

 Frankly: is the spring challenge going to stay online? it looks like the arena is still available
 struct: They will release it tomorrow
 aCat: nice
 aCat: will it finally get some name?
 wlesavo: aPac
 dbdr: I call is pac2020
 wlesavo: nice one
 wlesavo: like warcraft2000
 MSmits: PacWars2020
 MSmits: I see you're back to being a pussy wlesavo
 MSmits: or didnt you change your avatar before?
 wlesavo: the other one was also a pussy
 eulerscheZahl: finally the old wlesavo is back
 wlesavo: changed it after the end of recalc
 eulerscheZahl: still cached
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: struct 08:03PMThey will release it tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: oh, just saw it on discord
 tutubalin: somebody mentioned me here, but i cannot see message now
 tutubalin: could you please repeat your message?
 eulerscheZahl: i can mention you now if it makes you happy.
 eulerscheZahl: tutubalin
 struct: I think someone said you reached wood 1 in  100 lines of js
 tutubalin: are, yes )i will post my code in post mortem
 tutubalin: eulerscheZahl thank you! i mention you back )
 eulerscheZahl: :wave:
 d0npr0n: Where can I continue improving my Bot for the Spring challenge? Cant seem to find it...
 eulerscheZahl: tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: will be in compete/multiplayer
 d0npr0n: ah ok, thanks
 Csipcsirip: is there an existing UCB algorithm where the node tree is not a tree but a 2d grid, or I invented something new&#160;? 
 struct: how does it work?
 Csipcsirip: basically thats all. 2d array of visits and rewards. and I have an extra 2d array of visit counts of cells in the actual simulation. to punish in the UCB formula the cells, that are visited multiple times in one iteration.
 Csipcsirip: I came up with the idea during the contest but didnt know how to handle crosses that should be visited multiple times
 Csipcsirip: it converges pretty quickly 200 itereaion with 40 depth. cant wait to try it out in pacman multi 
 MSmits: not sure if it is compatible with traditional mcts type algorithms
 MSmits: but it sounds interesting
 Csipcsirip: oh and I have a separate matrices for each pacman. and each pacman gets a percentage of other pacmans rewards
 MSmits: sounds a bit like how i did PCR
 MSmits: basically my smitsi algorithm with a score per chip and an overall team score, but my way doesnt work that well on grids where movement can be blocked
 MSmits: if you can do something similar but with a fix, i'd be very interested in reading about it
 Csipcsirip: yeah I got the idea from smitsimax. thats what I used in contest 
 MSmits: ohh
 Csipcsirip: with this "colllaboration coefficien"
 MSmits: but you didnt use actual smitsimax right? an idea that just shared some similarities?
 MSmits: because i've been telling people it wont work for spring challenge
 MSmits: I would feel guilty :P
 Csipcsirip: I think its very similar to smitsimax. ucb tree for each pacmans
 MSmits: ah ok
 Csipcsirip: pacmen*
 MSmits: but dont they get in eachothers way?
 Csipcsirip: no because of they get a percentage of other pacs rewards
 MSmits: hmm ok
 KnightMoves: I also used Smitsimax 😄
 MSmits: lol
 KnightMoves: I did have to make some changes, but it got me to legend
 eulerscheZahl: you are a new user, do you even know what that is? :D
 MSmits: well it shouldn't work, the fact that you guys got it to work, is your achievement&#160;:)
 KnightMoves: Luckily he wrote an article about it! I found a link to it on the one of the other challenges, and thought it would be good for this contest
 MSmits: good thought apparently
 MSmits: reminds me of xmas rush where half the top 10 used it even though it shouldnt have worked there either
 Csipcsirip: I needed a very strong rollout heuristics tho. struggled with it for days
 MSmits: I guess it's because nothing really *works* in games like this. You start with some idea and adapt it until it does what you want, but nothing is perfect
 Quidome: I don't get XP for solved puzzles at the moment
 jacek: oO
 karliso: I guess it's because nothing really *works* in games like this. ---- so true, I wasted so much time trying various adnavced search approaches none all of which gave significant improvement.
 KnightMoves: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d31fb82-2d22-4772-9e2f-48f4de3d6ba1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d31fb82-2d22-4772-9e2f-48f4de3d6ba1</a>
 KnightMoves: i guess you can't send long messages...
 MSmits: i read it, yeah you could be right
 MSmits: reading other people's PM, there are many valid approaches here
 jacek: ifletons for the win
 MSmits: ifletons?
 eulerscheZahl: if else
 MSmits: o
 karliso: What I tried was: use my tracking to build a potential opponent game state and then search from his side... the use his moves and simulate my turn to make good moves... and so on recursively deeper..
 karliso: But it wasn't any better than simple approach.
 MSmits: i was afraid it wouldn't be so I tried to keep it simple. Simple was hard enough
 MSmits: also damn... what did you do to uttt :P
 karliso: I improved by base code, was working on it for a while.
 MSmits: ohh ok
 karliso:                   MSmits    GW=96,26%    [ W=94,25%   L=1,72%    D=4,02%   ] [522]
 karliso: From white side
 MSmits: wow thats crazy
 eulerscheZahl: what game is this?
 MSmits: uttt
 karliso: I feel mentally exhausted, feel like need a break.
 MSmits: take a break so i can figure out whats different about your bot :P
 MSmits: but grats
 karliso: btw, I found a weakness in your opening book from a white side...
 MSmits: i do too
 MSmits: i found it already
 MSmits: its my teccles heuristic
 MSmits: its imperfect
 MSmits: beatable
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are first again. congrats!
 karliso: No, I meant you said you have 100% as white
 MSmits: in your old bot
 MSmits: that version I did a 300 game cg bench against you and won all 300
 MSmits: as p1
 MSmits: as soon as you change 1 thing it no longer holds of course
 karliso: Yea, but I didnt take moves back.. but added even more 
 MSmits: ahh I see
 MSmits: you do realize that makes it easy for me to counter you again?
 karliso: Now the forced line is eve nlonger.. :D
 MSmits: best is to have less moves
 MSmits: instead of more
 karliso: yeah, but i can turn it off any time
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: btw
 karliso: Just trying to make a point.
 MSmits: something has been bugging me and also re curse
 MSmits: do you really get 400k rollouts during a normal turn?
 MSmits: we think that has to be impossible, especially re curse who has been trying hard to get his higher a while ago... it helped a bit but nowhere enough
 KnightMoves: on turn 2?
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: 400k? and here i am poor within 15k
 karliso: I think rollout count is not that important, but I do get a lot
 KnightMoves: the highest i could get is 20k...
 MSmits: I get 130k at the most with a good cpu and I think re curse  about 180k or more
 KnightMoves: are there any good resources for how to optimize like that? I did pretty much every thing i could think of and hit a limit
 MSmits: c++&#160;?
 KnightMoves: yeah
 KnightMoves: i'm using bitboards
 jacek: GCC optimizations?
 MSmits: making the random rollout fast is important
 MSmits: its quite costly
 KnightMoves: yeah i use #pragma GCC optimize "O3,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 jacek: yours random? i thought it was 1-ply win
 MSmits: huh what?
 MSmits: i dont always get jacek humor :P
 darkhorse64: On oware
 jacek: if can win, use that move. otherwise random
 MSmits: oh
 jacek: or your rollouts are compleetely random
 karliso: My 1st turn could look like this:
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/71b8984d-9227-403c-912a-d3025cc778f1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/71b8984d-9227-403c-912a-d3025cc778f1</a>
 MSmits: hmm it's quasi random yes
 MSmits: but what are these countes karliso?
 MSmits: do you rollout a game all  the way to the end and count that as  a single visit?
 jacek: not everything i say is humorours
 karliso: More or less
 eulerscheZahl: is that a joke jacek?
 MSmits: no i know, i just dont get it right away jacek :P
 JBM: i found it funny
 JBM: not sure if joke tho
 MSmits: karliso do you use fancy AVX stuff or other tricks noone knows about?  No need to tell them
 karliso: I do use AVX for node selection only
 MSmits: oh I tried that
 MSmits: didnt get it to work properly
 MSmits: well, it wasnt any faster anyway
 MSmits: do you think it helped you a lot?
 karliso: It was not a big improvement if i recall correctly
 MSmits: also, do you rollout from 1 chid on each expansion or all children at once (like some other players). This second method gives way more rollouts
 karliso: I have already answered this question before
 MSmits: sorry
 MSmits: i thought you said 1 child then
 karliso: I said somethign else
 MSmits: i just have a hard time understanding your high numbers
 MSmits: was i online when you said this? I dont remember, or maybe i misunderstood
 karliso: You asked me this
 MSmits: oh
 Astrobytes: (they don't call him Memory Smits for nothing :P )
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: damn, i wish i'd remember, seems important
 karliso: I feel like doing node selection for each node is not the right approach in this game.
 MSmits: what do you mean node selection for each node?
 MSmits: you somehow go down the tree differently?
 MSmits: or wait... maybe you prune lots of moves
 karliso: You could select one node and expand one child.
 karliso: Which could probably give more accurate scores.
 MSmits: you mean select it heuristically?
 MSmits: to get better moves?
 karliso: Yeah, one could select one child as heuristic
 MSmits: like... expand a winning move first?
 MSmits: that wins a miniboard
 karliso: And rollout only 1, but I feel like you should expand al childs.
 MSmits: hmm ok
 karliso: Ahh, I think I misunderstood
 karliso: You asked something else
 MSmits: my question was mostly about how a rollout is defined, to somehow explain the high numbers
 MSmits: but if you have to give away too much to even explain how you define a rollout, you shouldnt say
 karliso: Select a node and rollout of each cild is defined as a separate count
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: so you select a node, expand it, it gets 9 children and it counts as 9 visits because you do 9 playouts to end?
 karliso: Roughly so
 MSmits: ahhh, that totally explains the numbers!
 MSmits: this is what darkhorse does and he insists it's better, while I cant get it to work better
 MSmits: but i get many more rollouts that way
 darkhorse64: I do that but I do not get 400k
 MSmits: no, but i do get nearly twice as many and if i were re curse and adapted my bot i could get to 400k
 MonZtaDeluxe: anybody got an idea in code4life how to decide if a sample is diagnosed or undiagnosed?
 MonZtaDeluxe: i guess i'm too drunk to read this from the description
 MSmits: karliso thanks for explaining, this has been bugging me for a while&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: -1 value = undiagnosed
 4candles: Hi all, I'm a beginner here and don't understand how I can debug to see the state of my variables at each frame. Can anyone help please?
 MonZtaDeluxe: danke &lt;3
 darkhorse64: You mean my implementation sucks&#160;? Guess you may be right :grimacing:
 Hjax: try printing your variables to stderr 4candles
 MSmits: no, i am saying both ours suck compared to re curses powerhouse :P
 4candles: Thanks. I did, It just complains that it is not the output it is looking for.
 Hjax: 4candles print to stderr not stdout
 4candles: That is the bit I need help with&#160;:)
 MSmits: but karliso is right, rollouts is less important than other factors
 Hjax: what language are you using?
 4candles: Python
 MSmits: i just didnt like not knowing why the high numbers
 eulerscheZahl: the default code should have a commented line directly before the print
 Hjax: @4candles import syssys.stderr.write(myvariable)sys.stderr.flush()
 4candles: thank you i will try it
 4candles: that is different to the comment
 eulerscheZahl: different ways to do the same thing
 eulerscheZahl: flush is important though
 Miarem: MSmits, i still don't see why there should be such be difference for rolling out 1 or all childs
 Miarem: i tried both... and got more or less same numbers
 Miarem: around 100k
 MSmits: selection is expensive
 MSmits: I think I got nearly 200k for rolling out all children
 MSmits: selection goes less deep and happens far less ofte 
 Hjax: what game are we talking about? UTTT? 
 MSmits: yes
 Miarem: it is not a game!
 Miarem: don't dare to play with it
 MSmits: it is life?
 Miarem: indeed, it'll consume your life
 jacek: dont play with it! youll get blind!
 Miarem: :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's Pandora's box
 MSmits: so i was right Miarem
 MSmits: i am not who you should watch out for in uttt&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: More like the Hellraiser Puzzle Box
 Miarem: by the way
 MSmits: karliso is 5 points ahead of you and 2 points ahead of me :P
 Miarem: whut!?
 MSmits: yepp
 KnightMoves: if you're rolling out all the children, do you still use UCT?
 MSmits: yes, during selection
 MSmits: its only the expanded node's children you roll out from
 MSmits: so at most 9 rollouts at the start
 MSmits: per iteration
 MSmits: you just play more games per selection round
 MSmits: it works in many games
 Hjax: when i was messing around with UCT i wasnt sure if it was better to rollout all children or not 
 KnightMoves: yeah makes sense, i think i'll give that a try
 karliso: Would be cool if someone challenged my bot.
 WINWINWIN: multi out yet?
 MSmits: I use it in Yavalath, which means a whopping 50+ rollouts per iteration at the start
 eulerscheZahl: got delayed till tomorrow WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: K
 MSmits: challenged how? I will be researching your opening book at least karliso. Primarily not even to beat you, just because it interests me to figure out what makes someone win at this game
 KnightMoves: besides making your bots play UTTT, have you played much?
 MSmits: the teccles heuristic is really interesting to me also. Still not sure why it works
 karliso: Well I dont have much of an opening book MSmits
 KnightMoves: I'm curious if anyone has an intuitive sense for the game
 Miarem: i'm accepting the challenge!  : )
 MSmits: hmm, then it is deterministic because of something else karliso
 MSmits: your old version almost always did the same moves
 karliso: the teccles heuristic is really interesting to me also. Still not sure why it works
 karliso: I have some insights
 jacek: teccless heuristic?
 jacek: make move to the same board?
 MSmits: it means when you're on an empty board, you send the opponent to the same board
 MSmits: yes
 Miarem: oh... that is forbidden knowledge!
 karliso: * First, you don't want to win board by giving free move
 karliso: This avoids it.
 jacek: when i play against computer it seems its doing that
 MSmits: but it's an opening game gambit... so there are no finished boards yet karliso
 Miarem: so lucky to drop in here, tonight&#160;: )
 karliso: * secondly (from a white player side) it increases variance.
 Miarem: so many insights
 karliso: * thirdly you usually dont want to win board 3 vs 0:
 MSmits: ah yes that last one i did realize
 MSmits: you want him to waste moves
 karliso: Like you play board... and opponent sends you here again...
 karliso: If you make 2 in a row... then if you play you either win 3 v 0 or make a useless move.. or he plays and he can block you
 MSmits: makes sense yes
 MSmits: up to now, i have never found proof of a situation where the teccles heuristic is weaker than another move
 karliso: I have seen games...
 MSmits: but I think it might be... not sure yet
 MSmits: yes games, but i mean from a meta mcts perspective, running millions of games, doing research on this
 karliso: But it is usually last open board or close to that .. and potentially some board has already been won
 MSmits: i find better winrates for teccles heuristic
 MSmits: oh, last open board yes
 MSmits: that is possible
 MSmits: you need to get quite deep to test that
 MSmits: didnt get around to testing that deep yet
 MSmits: well I'm glad someone else shares my fascination with this game :P
 Miarem: Something wrong happened(-2)
 MSmits: lol
 Miarem: this is what my uTTT page says
 eulerscheZahl: the error code is -5 for you
 Miarem: i know, it sounds like a lame excuse, but i can't load the multi&#160;: )
 MSmits: oh lol, i thought you were kidding
 MSmits: like euler is&#160;:)
 Cappefra: ok I can now tell 100% that contests are amazing for improving algo skills
 MSmits: for sure
 Miarem: well, i keep refreshing the page, but results is the same
 eulerscheZahl: and now you can read the forum to see what others did (if you haven't already)
 MSmits: wont load for me either miarem
 jacek: youre banned from uttt forever
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: it loaded!
 Miarem: yeah, i got it as welll
 Miarem: i think it's karliso's dirty hack
 tutubalin: eulerscheZahl nice replay with 2 traps! i like your approach
 MSmits: maybe&#160;:)
 Miarem: i just wanted to watch some karliso-karliso games&#160;: )
 MSmits: an unstoppable force vs immovable object?
 eulerscheZahl: i even found a replay where i killed 3 out of 5 opponents. an still lost!
 Miarem: exactly!
 Miarem: it seems pretty predefined
 Miarem: at turn 33 X get a win
 Miarem: 5 games in a row
 tutubalin: when i fixed a bug in enemy tracking, i dropped 600 places down
 Miarem: and he doesn't call it an opening book?!
 MSmits: well its possible it is deterministic
 MSmits: might not be opening book
 MSmits: sometimes bots will just always react the same way
 MSmits: minimax is worse like that
 Miarem: anyway, it is easy to overcome this
 MSmits: I did it before, to all 3 of you, so yeah
 MSmits: but i am more interested in just making my bot better
 karliso: Actually It is opennig boook... but those 30 or so move from both sides is like half of my opening book moves, lol.
 MSmits: by learning tricks about the game, better heuristics etc
 MSmits: karliso, one time i noticed your games vs re curse went almost 20 deep with no change
 MSmits: that was also a book i assume?
 karliso: well... he plays a forced line....
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: so you both did :P
 karliso: if he didnt, i wouldt either
 MSmits: same here&#160;:)
 Miarem: all games and at 51st turn
 MSmits: its a funyn situation
 MSmits: funny
 MSmits: you do realize us 4 are the only ones doing this
 MSmits: the rest of uttt is book-clean
 Miarem: pure kids
 MSmits: and i cant write an opening book to counter any of them, a book is useless vs them
 MSmits: i tried and it barely helps at all
 karliso: Miarem you started this...
 Miarem: i think i did
 Miarem: i do regret it now
 MSmits: yeah you even sometimes went on the board saying things like: "well this should last me a while" after you got nr 1
 karliso: It is not like I have an opening book as much as I have Opening book vs thir opening book.
 MSmits: i should have realized you just updated your book right then&#160;:)
 Miarem: but i'm curious how deep can we get
 4candles: Another beginner question (sorry).. is there a way to insert multiple cursor to comment or (un-comment) a block at once? Thanks.
 karliso: MSmitss, nagraok, shummie don't have much of an opening book and I don't ahve anything vs them either
 pb4: "MSmits 21H38the teccles heuristic is really interesting to me also. Still not sure why it works"
 jacek: ctrl+/&#160;?
 MSmits: miarem i have books that go all the way to solved status
 pb4: What is that&#160;?
 MSmits: against you 3 this happens sometimes
 MSmits: or at least until my bot solves it during a normal game
 MSmits: pb4 its when you play an empty board
 MSmits: and you pick the cell that sends your opponent to the same board
 Miarem: i also have solved entries in a book, but my book is a bit outdated
 MSmits: its almost always the strongest move, karliso says it may fail om the last empty board or so, but i havent seen that yet
 Miarem: ,if you wish
 MSmits: Miarem yeah, do you still have that book where karliso wins the 1st board on ply 12?
 MSmits: or so?
 MSmits: that is what boosted him hard
 Miarem: i can submit a bookless commit right now
 karliso: MSmits I deleted that line from my side, it was no good
 Miarem: i'm going to rewrite it anyway
 MSmits: yeah i couldnt use it either
 karliso: (from my side)
 jacek: opening books contest? what is this, early computer chess tournament
 MSmits: my meta mcts would not allow me to use the same move vs miarem
 dbf: jacek, it is a data compression contest&#160;:)
 MSmits: jacek, yeah it is a bit strange, we're hijacking chat to discuss opening books for a while now
 MSmits: I'm not sorry though, its fun :P
 karliso: btw, MSmits I think side openign as black as you do migh actually be a better move.
 MSmits: yeah, i learned that from re curse
 struct: When are you gonna play Yavalath?
 MSmits: it seems to be better indeed
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: do you mean first move?
 karliso: ad black
 MSmits: like next to center cross on the side?
 karliso: yeah
 MSmits: I have no idea if that is better. I did not explore it enough
 MSmits: because noone uses it
 MSmits: re curse had it for a while, then dropped it
 Miarem: my mtcs doesn't aprove this move
 MSmits: mine either atm, but i meant the second move as black
 MSmits: you all pick corner
 MSmits: but re curse picks middle edge
 MSmits: that last one seems to be better for me
 Miarem: he did for a while
 MSmits: i mean on the corner board
 MSmits: 4th ply
 MSmits: p1 plays corner, using teccles, then you and kar liso play a corner as p2
 MSmits: re curse does mid edge then
 jacek: why do you put space after re
 MSmits: ping
 struct: jace k
 jacek: Automaton2000 is it ok?
 Automaton2000: trying to get it to work
 MSmits: dont want to spam, i know you would like torment him about uttt, but I am a nice person :P
 pb4: You don't want him to read your *confidential* strategic discussion&#160;? :D
 MSmits: re curse just really hates the game
 MSmits: i honestly dont want to stress him out :0
 pb4: Back to :popcorn:
 derjack: him?
 MSmits: yes, re curse is one of our top players, does many interesting things on CG
 MSmits: like pb4
 Miarem: i just noticed... there are 6 Unnamed Players in uTTT legend
 MSmits: alt accounts?
 jacek: maybe they couldnt get into content legent
 karliso: Hate and love is related
 jacek: why i cant type right
 karliso: They are not the opposites
 MSmits: I guess you're right in a way
 karliso: The opposite of love is indifference
 MSmits: jacek, what did you do to karliso
 MSmits: he went all philosophical suddenly
 Astrobytes: Very profound
 jacek: i distract him from uttt
 eulerscheZahl: you are 1 day too late
 karliso: No, I cant think about any game. So exhausted after the competition.
 Miarem: lol, jacek i studied in the same university! 
 jacek: in gdansk?
 MSmits: I didn't code all day yesterday because I was already too exhausted, i know the feeling karliso
 Miarem: yeap, had a year of my erasmus mundus
 struct: Should I leave steal on Yinsh?I think I asked this before 
 jacek: yes
 jacek: its gonna occupy bookers for a while
 karliso: MSmits, I coded all weeked. wanted to win very much, but I focused on the wrong things I believe. My approach was too complex.
 MSmits: everyone did things wrong, looking from the PM's. Some people just did less wrong things than others&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: struct we forget the rules every time when you ask once in a month
 MSmits: but you did really well karliso, remember, it is 5k players
 Hjax: the pacman game broke my brain 
 struct: euler this time Ill finish
 struct: Im currently working on it
 Hjax: too much uncertainty 
 Astrobytes: So true eulerscheZahl :D
 karliso: I definitely had the best tracking I think.
 struct: But to be fair I also forgot the rules :p
 Astrobytes: lol ffs :D
 struct: Yinsh has been on hold for 8 months
 MSmits: did you post a PM karliso? 
 MSmits: you dont have to, just wondering
 karliso: It is a bit painful to enumarate all my failed attempts to improve to search.
 karliso: my search*
 MSmits: very true
 MSmits: sometimes it helps getting it out of your system though, it does for me
 BenjaminUrquhart: Hjax I call it heuristic hell
 MSmits: write through the pain!
 karliso: it was a great learning experience though.
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: brb
 Miarem: karliso, i asked before, but you didn't have a change to reply
 Miarem: do you code on a daily basis?
 Miarem: are software engineer?
 karliso: Masters in math, self learned programmer, worked 1 year as a software engineer in a very strong team. Now unemployed 
 Brokolis: Why unemployed?
 karliso: i have not been hired
 BenjaminUrquhart: what kind of achievement is "thinker"
 karliso: I look suspicious perhaps
 JBM: Some form of populism
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh forum likes
 Brokolis: Just wondering if I can ever return to my country if master's graduate with experience cannot land a job
 Astrobytes: "I look suspicious" :D
 JBM: Some form of populism.
 karliso: I got into CG  year ago when they asked me to code Hypersonic bot as part of interview process.
 JBM: You sure do
 JBM: Wow hardcore
 KobeL: astro, seeing your results in the competitions, you just are ;p
 karliso: They were in 100ish positions and were very prod. I Made it to top 5 very soon and they still didnt hire me. :D
 JBM: Have you gone with the now famous MOVE 0 0 strategy?
 struct: lol
 struct: They only want the best
 struct: 1st or nothing
 MSmits: karliso what the hell, they are nuts
 JBM: Well it*did*get me to silver
 MSmits: that hypersonic bot took me months to code
 JBM: Make of that what you will
 Brokolis: Which company if I may ask?
 MSmits: and you beat it fast
 Miarem: is it just me of JBM sounds like Automaton?
 MSmits: he does
 JBM: Can you tell us apart?
 Miarem: is he?
 struct: Yes, he is but with bigger delay
 JBM: Let's call that that miarem test
 Miarem: rofl
 Astrobytes: KobeL I couldn't (and can't) participate effectively currently as I'm on dihydrocodeine for a back problem
 JBM: Automaton2000 would you pass That test?
 Automaton2000: do you have any idea how to do the first move
 Miarem: i'm just reading a book on Turing test
 JBM: Yeah it sure who lags the most TBH
 KobeL: That's fair astro! I actually meant you did well
 Miarem: karliso - aim for FAANG
 dbf: I wish more companies ask to write Hyporsonic bots rather than whiteboard coding excercises
 Astrobytes: Oh ok, not recently I'm afraid :DDid you participate in this one KobeL?
 Miarem: you can definetly aim there
 Brokolis: FAANG is the onl ones actually worth jumping thorugh hoops for
 JBM: But are they?
 Miarem: yes JBM
 MSmits: what is FAANG?
 dbf: facebook, amazon etc
 MSmits: sounds like a team of supervillains out of a comic book
 Astrobytes: An extra long tooth MSmits
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: makes total sense now Astrobytes
 Miarem: companies that a ready to give 6digit sum to SWE
 dbf: it is not the easiest way to have 6digits, but probably not as boring as finance
 MSmits: I wouldn't know what to do with all that money
 MSmits: I'd just have maybe a server room to run more instances of meta mcts.
 jacek: give it to me *.*
 MSmits: yeah that
 Miarem: buy an amazon cluster to solve uTTT
 Miarem:  :)
 Astrobytes: I've got a 6-digit income. If I count digits after the decimal point.
 MSmits: right
 JBM: Miarem: please expand
 MSmits: thats the only thing i can think of
 MSmits: lol Astrobytes
 jacek: thats why i would by gazillion cores
 dbf: I created open-book for my utt at 20$/month VPS&#160;:)
 Miarem: damn it, the THING learned my name
 MSmits: lol nice dbf
 BenjaminUrquhart: it knows
 dbf: only because I hate noise of my desktop at night
 struct: How much for your bot?
 MSmits: my wife doesnt let me run it at night for the same reason&#160;:)
 struct: Will 200$ do?
 MSmits: and because she thinks it may catch fire
 wlesavo: i got like 10 digits in binary
 KobeL: @Astrobytes a very crude base to get into bronze, nothing more, loads of uni work/I prefer to stream and do some easier stuff
 jacek: is it intel?
 MSmits: mine is
 MSmits: ys
 dbf: I have PC in separate room now, but I don't want to touch my utt code anymore&#160;:)
 MSmits: every few months i get a bunch of new ideas for uttt and i have to work on it
 Astrobytes: All good KobeL, it's all about fun at the end of the day anyways&#160;;)
 struct: I can sleep with pc turned on, but I sleep with ear plugs
 MSmits: it's like a recurring thing
 struct: I once left it turned on for CvZ, with no success
 dbf: I think I've done most of performance fixes avaiable in java, and have no good ideas about game play
 KobeL: So true @Astrobytes
 Miarem: MSmits, my bookless commit ended up at #15
 jacek: convert to c++
 MSmits: wow
 Miarem: i got really addicted to that stuff
 MSmits: my bookless bot beats re curse bot with book :P
 jacek: try Y
 MSmits: yours too
 Miarem:&#160;: )
 MSmits: just not karliso's
 MSmits: he's too damned strong
 Astrobytes: I don't leave my PC on at night currently as my second HD is failing and so had to reduce the pagefile size, and each day it fails more and throws a nice INPAGE_ERROR
 struct: your uttt is bookless?
 Miarem: but i'll keep it there, for the motivation purpose
 dbf: jacek, if I convert is will be just another c++ bot, and my aim is #1 in java, but dbdr need to rewrite his bot in rust first
 MSmits: not the one on the board currently struct
 MSmits: but with cg bench tests i can test it without book
 MSmits: and it does fine
 struct: if you update book, will it beat karlis o?
 MSmits: yes, as p1, 100%
 MSmits: and then he will change something
 MSmits: and its my turn
 struct: Yeah, I see&#160;:/
 MSmits: again
 struct: shame
 MSmits: but struct, the solution to this is to not have a book
 MSmits: without a book you are invulnerable to this
 Miarem: no&#160;: )
 struct: Are you though?
 MSmits: well you mostly are, i cant get a 100% winrate vs someone without a book
 MSmits: as p1 that is
 MSmits: the book makes you strong and vulnerable both
 jacek: so philosophical
 struct: True and also you need to book vs multiple players
 struct: so
 MSmits: but there's only 4 with books now
 MSmits: the others dont, well at most 2 moves
 MSmits: let me put it this way. If you have a book vs someone without one, you probably increase your winrate by 5-10% at most, I am thinking more like 5%
 MSmits: but book vs book you get into 0 to 100% situations
 Hjax: are the bookless uttt programs not vulnerable to some traps? 
 MSmits: uttt doesnt really have traps
 Hjax: i see 
 MSmits: yavalath does
 struct: also why 100% vs book?
 Miarem: uTTTT is trap itself&#160;: )
 MSmits: because I can start my meta mcts from their last book move struct, and then solve the game
 struct: Ah I see
 struct: So you make sure you go until his last book move and then improve your book after that move?
 MSmits: impossible to do from ply 2
 MSmits: exactly
 Hjax: solution: generate lots of books and switch between them randomly 
 Hjax: and make your opponent really annoyed when they try to counter you
 MSmits: not really a solution, I have room for hundreds of lines of play in my book. It's not even 5% filled
 Astrobytes: Don't give Smits ideas Hjax
 Astrobytes: :P
 jacek: so not using unicode stuff yet?
 MSmits: the counter books arent mutually exclusive, i just always let my  meta mcts find the optimal line of play, so it doesnt hurt me
 MSmits: nope
 Hjax: i wont give him good ones, just bad ones, turns out i have more of the latter than the former 
 MSmits: 8 kb book
 MSmits: no unicode
 MSmits: hjax, we both had almost the same ideas on the last contest 
 MSmits: I could tell you nothing new almost
 jacek: symmetry? i think there is not much symmetry in uttt except first or second mvoe
 Hjax: yes, but yours worked and mine didnt 
 struct: I wonder if it will be possible to make opening books on Yinsh, there are 8×10e13 starting positions
 Hjax: i blame java 
 struct: Considering symetries
 Hjax: :P
 MSmits: might be&#160;:)
 MSmits: struct it's really hard to tell without knowing more about the game
 Hjax: i should really learn C++ for these coding competition things 
 MSmits: yavalath has insane branching and yet its possible
 Hjax: its just so hard when you are used to nice things like python and java
 Astrobytes: 8×10e13 opening moves perhaps, but maybe not that many ones worth doing
 struct: True, most positions on Yavalath are useless
 struct: true Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: we never had a physics game with hidden information :thinking: AutomatonNN
 MSmits: Hjax it helps to do a few simple simulation games like uttt
 AutomatonNN: can't find the problem
 struct: Lets hope it stays this way AntiSquid
 struct: But we have
 struct: FB, CSB has hidden information
 Hjax: i wrote... half of a UTTT program in C++ but didnt finish it 
 MSmits: Hjax i meant to practice c++ btw
 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: we'll see in 6 months
 AntiSquid: CSB has hidden info how
 MSmits: i did one in C# and converted it to c++
 Hjax: i think i finished my board representation, but didnt finish my search 
 MSmits: thats easier than doing it from scratch
 struct: You dont know if opponent has shielded
 dbf: AntiSquid, what about CSB at night when you can rotate flashlight?
 struct: on FB you dont know what speel he made
 AntiSquid: oh perfct dbf
 AntiSquid: that's the fall CG contest
 MSmits: also hjax, i am pretty lousy at c++. I know just enough to do arenas with and mostly it goes ok on contests, though i still worry the game will be too complex
 AntiSquid: contest name: Backlights are broken! so pods with flash lights
 struct: The next contest is 3d
 Astrobytes: They seem to be obsessed with hidden info and FOW rn so I don't have high hopes for the 'fall' contest
 jacek: FOW?
 Hjax: the next contest will have meta fog of war, you dont get to see the game board, the rules, or your code 
 struct: fog of war
 MSmits: I prefer if they didnt do hidden info, but I'll join anyway
 Astrobytes: fog of war jacek
 Astrobytes: lol Hjax
 AntiSquid: i asked same question earlier today jacek, bloody acronyms
 AntiSquid: first thought it's some algo
 struct: collisions in this contest were a bit foggy
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's the Find Other Ways algo AntiSquid
 jacek: well, MuZero is about learning game without rules and yet it exceeded AlphaZero
 MSmits: Mu?
 MSmits: shouldn't they do Beta first?
 AntiSquid: BetaZero sounds funny
 MSmits: GammaZero?
 MSmits: DeltaZero?
 JBM: we've got all night
 MSmits: Why mu.. seems overconfident
 Astrobytes: MuZero is when they get cats to search
 JBM: so lambdazero?
 JBM: just a notch under overconfident?
 Astrobytes: Baby sheep search
 AntiSquid: you're a physicist MSmits you should know that constant / variable names aren't used in any particular order
 JBM: or meaning, ftm
 MSmits: i am not too sure of that
 MSmits: we physicists used all of them multiple times :P
 MSmits: but sure you're right&#160;:)
 JBM: invent new ones!
 JBM: that's where all the high-end research rage is
 JBM: i'm sure
 MSmits: true story, I quit an optional class at the university because they made me write this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_(letter)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_(letter)</a>
 MSmits: (capital, with all the squiggles)
 wlesavo: constants is overrated, make new laws, not assign constants
 AntiSquid: then the final openai bot is AbsoluteZero /s
 JBM: writing doesn't have to be calligraphy
 JBM: this is merely one squiggle more than the most common letter of quite a few languages
 MSmits: I said to the professor, cant i just write "x"?
 JBM: x is two bars
 JBM: xi three
 JBM: not so different
 MSmits: nope he kept telling me you cant do general relativity without that sign
 MSmits: i mean the other one
 struct: Ξξ
 Astrobytes: MSmits that's weak! I lived/worked in Corfu for 8 months and taught myself the alphabet and how to write it properly from food/household item ingredients! Fix your handwriting :P
 Hjax: @MSmits should have gotten a stamp 
 MSmits: my handwriting is horrible, unfixable
 struct: poor students
 Astrobytes: Typical physicist :P
 MSmits: Hjax that would have been a good idea yeah
 JBM: dont get physicists mixed up with physicians there
 Astrobytes: They have equally bad handwriting JBM
 JBM: no siree
 MSmits: physicians are worse imho
 AntiSquid: wait aren't doctors the ones with worst handwriting&#160;?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/669/">https://xkcd.com/669/</a>
 JBM: there.
 wlesavo: MSmits wow, same here, i cant write, or at least others cant understand if i write smth
 Astrobytes: Physician is a doctor...
 AntiSquid: i mean doctors in general
 JBM: not all physicists are doctors
 MSmits: I can make myself understood reasonably well on a whiteboard if i dont write too many sentences and stick with formulas
 MSmits: but i prefer to use powerpoints
 Astrobytes: Medical doctors. ie. physicians, are generally not physicists 
 MSmits: in high school I had a teacher with an eye problem. He said he had a machine to enlarge handwiriting but he only used it to grade *my* tests
 AntiSquid: really how many doctors do you know Astrobytes&#160;?
 AntiSquid: maybe they are all physicists
 Astrobytes: 3, only one is a physicist, and he's not a medical doctor, he has a doctorate in physics :P
 struct: Im a physicist aswell
 MSmits: really?
 JBM: whereas physicians... do they even have doctorates?
 struct: no
 JBM: i KNEW it
 MSmits: lol
 struct: But I have physicist handwriting
 struct: if that counts
 JBM: same by me
 JBM: try telling us about the squiggles, just to be sure?
 MSmits: sure, thats how i grade tests as well. I can't read this :poop: It's a 10!
 JBM: that's... internationally vert ambiguous
 JBM: *very
 MSmits: highest grade :P
 JBM: ok
 MSmits: didnt want to use the stupid American system
 struct: Even my numbers are hard to tell appart
 JBM: or the equally arbitrary french one
 MSmits: how does the French one work?
 Astrobytes: JBM I prefer ambiguously green as per your original statement
 JBM: typically 0-20
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: at least it starts with 0
 MSmits: ours starts with 1
 MSmits: its silly
 JBM: though some tolerance goes for primary school
 JBM: and their lower ends
 JBM: where 0-10 can be observed
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: thats best imho
 MSmits: 1-10 is stupid as well... a 9 wide scale
 JBM: all 10-17yo is on 0-20 guaranteed
 MSmits: many of my colleagues, like language teachers have problems converting to a 9 wide scale
 JBM: that's... well yeqh something else to get used to
 Astrobytes: 1-10?!
 JBM: think stars
 MSmits: yeah, thats our system
 MSmits: 1-10
 JBM: you can't rate 0 stars
 JBM: there wouldn't be anything to click on!
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: mmmh good point
 struct: Here is 0-100 until 9th grade then 0-20
 JBM: so think deeply
 MSmits: I like 0-100, takes care of decimals
 JBM: should grqdes be considered cardinal or ordinal?
 Astrobytes: But say a victim just puts nothing on their paper, what then?
 JBM: you'vegot 20s
 Astrobytes: *victim = student :P
 MSmits: cardinal?
 JBM: why not
 MSmits: is that a ratio scale?
 JBM: i mean both POVs are valid in ways
 MSmits: when a victim puts nothing on their paper, they get 1 here
 MSmits: or when they cheat
 MSmits: it's really the lowest grade
 JBM: oooooh we haven't debated that here
 Astrobytes: They should be burned for cheating
 JBM: what's "cheating"?
 JBM: is it well-defined?
 MSmits: copying someone elses stuff on a test&#160;:)
 JBM: legal or moral?
 Astrobytes: wrt?
 JBM: we had a 2h debate on #fr, sparked by reminiscing that US chap who outsourced his job to china
 MSmits: its funny how things are different with cheating in high school and college/university
 JBM: 6-fig salary, 1/6 of which went to china
 MSmits: in high school students consider it normal, in university they know it's really really bad
 JBM: oh right
 JBM: that debate sparked by whoever offered who;ever 200 $CUR for their pacman code
 Astrobytes: Really?! In highschool if I'd cheated I would get an F
 ZarthaxX: AstroF
 JBM: but what *is* cheating?
 JBM: was it clearly defined?
 MSmits: thats true here too, but it's more of a game to them, if they can get away with it, they have no problem with cheating
 Astrobytes: And probably face some kind of disciplinary
 MSmits: in the university noone will even try, you get expelled
 Astrobytes: That was a possibility in my highschool too MSmits
 MSmits: not here
 Astrobytes: This was a while ago mind
 ZarthaxX: in uni 2 guys cheated on an exam
 MSmits: also, i need to work pretty hard to prove that someone cheated
 Astrobytes: Hey Zarthaxington of ZarthaxXia
 ZarthaxX: the fuck is that name LMAO
 struct: Here you only get in trouble for plagiarism really
 struct: Rest is not a big deal
 Astrobytes: I'm trying to be creative
 ZarthaxX: hai astrobytopus
 MSmits: it's almost the same thing though struct
 Astrobytes: Oh I like that one ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: dinosaur like
 MSmits: i was thinking more of a seacreature ZarthaxX
 JBM: next you're gonna tell us you could cure cancer but don't wanna
 struct: I guess, but they only consider it if you copy works or something
 JBM: but what's copying
 MSmits: hmm ok struct
 JBM: take an alg exam
 ZarthaxX: MSmits mhmmhm
 ZarthaxX: maybe
 struct: ZarthaxX I need your designer expertise
 JBM: how many possible distinct solutions can you consider?
 ZarthaxX: oh mai
 ZarthaxX: what are you doing
 struct: I need you to make 3D Yinsh board
 ZarthaxX: D:
 ZarthaxX: how is that
 MSmits: you know whats funny. I only ever made one website, about black holes (its no longer up) and one time I caught a student copying from this site for an assignment and he didnt realize it was my website :P
 Astrobytes: I did some chemistry stuff with the Open University a few years ago, and my first assignment I was failed and reported for cheating. I'd used LaTeX and (we had to submit doc/docx) embedded my formulas as images
 struct: Ill pay well
 struct: 200$
 Astrobytes: I had to send my professor the LaTeX file and some screenshots
 JBM: wow
 JBM: depressing in too many ways
 MSmits: thats annoying Astrobytes, it worked out in the end?
 Astrobytes: Yes, but no more pretty LaTeX
 Astrobytes: I mean I'd used it fine for previous mathematics courses with no problems at all
 MSmits: i like LateX, but you need to work regularly with it to be fast with it
 Astrobytes: So I assumed it would be fine with the chemical notation plugin
 struct: I searched latex, went to images
 JBM: i wrote some latex formulae yesterday
 struct: not good
 JBM: for the first time in...
 MSmits: lol
 JBM: decades
 JBM: good thing we have wikibooks now
 Astrobytes: I'm wayyyyy rusty in it now
 Cappefra: I didn't mind writing my thesis with LaTeX
 JBM: as msmits said
 JBM: it's fine when you're bathed in it all the time
 Cappefra: right
 JBM: it's hard to quit and come back
 Astrobytes: yep
 MSmits: I wrote my thesis in it also
 ZarthaxX: struct talk to me later, im in class now :P
 MSmits: no talking during class!
 JBM: that's no time for class
 JBM: how dare you have another TZ
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: need more :beer:
 struct: I was joking btw ZarthaxX
 struct: Dont worry
 Astrobytes: Time for my pain meds, also goes well with a couple of beers if you fancy getting up late the next day :P
 MSmits: yeah I gotta get going also, finish some work and get some sleep
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 MSmits: and everyone else
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: Oh I'm still awake, takes an hour or so to kick in
 ZarthaxX: aight struct :P
 ZarthaxX: cya guys
 JBM: pain meds? what did i miss?
 Astrobytes: Got a terrible lower back issue JBM, had to go to hospital and everything. Been ongoing since end of last year, had numbness in limbs and such
 JBM: ouch&#160;:|
 Astrobytes: Tests ruled out all the worst things thankfully, but still not got to the bottom of the issue yet
 JBM: yeah i see what you mean
 JBM: well keep in there
 Astrobytes: Yep, taking each day as it comes as always
 JBM: that's the way
 Astrobytes: Was annoying since I got put on the strong meds a few days before the contest
 JBM: like, they impair your coding ability?
 Astrobytes: You could say that. Dihydrocodeine.
 JBM: like the house thing
 Astrobytes: How I managed to get Bronze is an achievement for me under those circumstances.
 Astrobytes: House thing? Like Dr House?
 JBM: yay
 JBM: diddn't codeine before him
 JBM: *know
 Astrobytes: Hah. Well, dihydrocodeine is a stronger version of codeine
 JBM: ok
 Astrobytes: Horrible stuff. Also on high dose naproxen (and omeprazole to counter any GI issues from that)
 Astrobytes: And diazepam at bedtime so I can sleep. And I can only sleep on the sofa right now, as I can't get out of bed if I lie down flat
 JBM: ah, valium
 JBM: had to wikipedia
 Astrobytes: And just to make things that little bit more fun, I bruised a rib on my computer chair arm while picking up my cat the other day. Happy days :P
 Astrobytes: I'd rather the bruised rib than the back *any day*
 Astrobytes: Anyway, enough of my moagning
 Astrobytes: *moaning
 JBM: yeah, good luck finding a night
 Astrobytes: A beer or 2  (no more) plus the meds helps a bit.
 JBM: yeah helps me too
 JBM: hard not to abuse
 JBM: though
 Astrobytes: I've had my times
 JBM: especially with that lockdown and me buying better beer for the occasion
 Astrobytes: Indeed :D
 Astrobytes: You on some medication also?
 JBM: not anything i'd discuss here
 JBM: wait, does beer count?
 JBM: i'm on beer
 Astrobytes: PM if you like, I am also on other medication
 JBM: my line's open
 AntiSquid: imagine working from home and being drunk on the job without anyone knowing AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: but i will give his time to train a bot
 AntiSquid: train bot drunk resulted in pacman gold league
 AntiSquid: that's why it's so random, everyone was drunk
 Astrobytes: Hm, might try that strategy next time
 Astrobytes: Anyway, gn
 mohammadhei05: hello
 JBM: hey
 Snef: Hello
 MadKnight: hey Snef
 MadKnight: how's your new cool game Snef&#160;?
 Snef: haven't started it yet 
 MadKnight: why?
 Snef: because i had only little free time these days
 Snef: i spent a bit on the contest but that's pretty much it
 Evansj306: Hello Everyone!&#160;:)
 MadKnight: hey Evansj306
 JBM: med
 JBM: (heya)
 JBM: how are you up this late
 MadKnight: gonna sleep soon
 JBM: spokojnoj
 Doumaki: hello guys i need some help understanding something 
 JBM: you look like you do
 Doumaki: what's that  10**20 
 Doumaki: someone just beat me in 2min in clash of C , it too me 12mins 
 Doumaki: he used variable = 10**20 he used python 
 iiAviator: power
 c0cainee: 10**20 is 10^20
 iiAviator: 10 to the power of 20
 iiAviator: Yup
 DragonJ: why in CSB when I print a checkpoint it just does circles around it
 Snef: because you can only turn 18°
 Snef: so if you have enough speed you'll just orbit around it
 DragonJ: well the person with a speed of 5 did it to
 Snef: speed of 5&#160;? thrust is between 0 and 100
 DragonJ: thrust of 5 yeah
 Snef: if you print MOVE cpX cpY 5 it'll not circle around it
 Snef: you circle around it because you have too much speed
 DragonJ: circling was what me and the opponent with 5 thrust was doing
 Snef: can you copy a replay&#160;?
 Snef: there is an icon to share
 DragonJ: I hit replay same map and map switched what???
 DragonJ: just multiple glitches in a row is what I think happened
 Snef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/J90KShy.png">https://pasteboard.co/J90KShy.png</a>
 DragonJ: am stuck in bronze near top beat boss every three matches and than the losses are very weird
 Snef: look the url i paste
 Snef: click on that button and paste the url
 DragonJ: my code is 6 lines and I still have wacky things happen...
 Snef: show me your code atleast
 Snef: i can't help you without information
 DragonJ: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/2KE97o">https://codeshare.io/2KE97o</a>
 Snef: you are printing not what the game want
 DragonJ: yeah but it still runs 
 DragonJ: only reason I am not printing game normal is because debugging
 Snef: and&#160;?
 Snef: you are still doing it wrong
 Snef: to debug you should useprint("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr)
 Snef: and for print you should doprint(x,y,thrust)
 DragonJ: ok but changing those wont fix the issues
 Snef: the issue is as i said
 Snef: if you have too much speed
 Snef: and you are not facing the checkpoint
 Snef: you will circle around
 Snef: you should try doing more condition
 Snef: now you haveif angle &gt; 90 =&gt; thrust = 0else thrust = 100
 FrancoisB: "drift"

 C26_1: @all, everyone
 C26_1: I'm making the easiest contributions ever
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/799015dc4ee027db982af9d7d32e5a17f7ad">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/799015dc4ee027db982af9d7d32e5a17f7ad</a>
 C26_1: I've submitted it
 C26_1: Hope I get some feedbacks
 Husoski: C26_1 - Did you get a working answer to your float*integer == integer question this afternoon?
 C26_1: yes, I'm gonna do that
 Husoski: C26_1 What I was going to suggest is continued fractions, but it depends on the exact problem statement.  Floating binary can be tricky.  CF approximations will generally work though, in O(log(denominator)) time.'
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: @Husoki, Python has a problem with rounding using int() default function
 Husoski: That's not necessarily a problem, but division and multiplication, and decimal conversions often are.  Try print(100 * 0.07) to see what I mean.
 FORMS1: Can someone tell me why this if/else isnt causing the power to 4  change to 4 when the vertical speed (mars lander) goes over 10?
 FORMS1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2abe5d85-c24e-4cd7-b685-002c03ec5f35">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2abe5d85-c24e-4cd7-b685-002c03ec5f35</a>
 Uljahn: that's how if/else if/else work
 Uljahn: the first condition is always met in your case
 FORMS1: v_speed being less than 10 is always true?
 Uljahn: positive vertical speed means ascending
 FORMS1: oooh
 FORMS1: my guy, thanks or saving me hours of wasted time
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 FORMS1: think I just got it with by adding a height condition anyway

 YS_Yousef: hi
 derjack: huh? counting tic tac toe puzzle of the week
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 Nachosauce: Is there a built in way to deep copy a collection in C#? I can't find anything on google but sometimes thins hide pretty good&#160;:)
 Frankich: AFAIK, there isn't
 Killer_Kat: Any idea when we might be able to use python 3.10? I am looking forward to using the new Switch statements
 Uljahn: Killer_Kat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/</a>
 Killer_Kat: thx
 C26_1: @Killer_Kat, does adding more test into a contribution helps?
 C26_1: Like improve the quality or something
 Killer_Kat: I'm sorry I don't understand the question. Could you clarify?
 C26_1: Ok. So I'm making my contributions
 Uljahn: why?
 C26_1: And the contribute was so easy that in fact i need to add contributions as much as I can
 C26_1: The Link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/799015dc4ee027db982af9d7d32e5a17f7ad?comment=57574">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/799015dc4ee027db982af9d7d32e5a17f7ad?comment=57574</a>
 C26_1: add the test*
 C26_1: sr
 Killer_Kat: Well, I am not a moderator. Just a Script Kitty, however I think you only need more tests if they do something significantly different than the other tests, so that the program is able to adapt to different circumstances.
 Uljahn: yeah, each test should be aimed at some corner case i gues
 Killer_Kat: At least I think that's what you are asking, I am guessing English is not your first language?
 C26_1: Yea
 Killer_Kat: Estas bien amigo
 Killer_Kat: ingles es muy difícil
 Nachosauce: si
 Nachosauce: Estamos pasandolo muy bien&#160;:) We're having a good time!
 Killer_Kat: Tienes razón
 Uljahn: please note this channel is English-only, thanks.
 Killer_Kat: Ah sorry m8
 Uljahn: there are channels for some other languages though
 Killer_Kat: Neat, I'll have to check that out
 Uljahn: #es
 Killer_Kat: Gracias
 Uljahn: yw
 Killer_Kat: Do you speak Russian?
 Killer_Kat: if so how would you say "Script Kitty" I ask because you are also a cat
 6opoDuJIo: There is many ways to say that. For instance, Скриптовая кошечка 
 C26_1: #ru
 Killer_Kat: Interesting, it still sounds similar to the English 
 Killer_Kat: Learning about programing languages and normal languages both has certainly been interesting. Perhaps this is a strange question but do IDE's in different languages still use English for syntax?
 C26_1: I may have an opinion
 C26_1: Real lang and programming lang, both has some general purpose
 C26_1: Real lang: Communicate between people
 C26_1: Programming language: COmmunicate between computers
 C26_1: Real lang: Tenses, Plural, cases, gender...
 C26_1: Programming Langauge: Latin alphabet, special characters, rules to put where's special charaters...
 C26_1: And the very abstract one:
 C26_1: Meaning
 Empat13: No in general syntax on English. 1c programming language on Russian but it's not popular
 C26_1: Ah
 C26_1: I understand
 Killer_Kat: That makes sense
 Killer_Kat: I cant imagine what it would be like to live somewhere outside of the states and to have all of the technology and media all coming from the US. Although I guess it probably feels like how some people here see Japan lol
 Killer_Kat: Do other countries also have weebs?
 Uljahn: sure
 C26_1: sure
 Uljahn: also English is almost always the first foreign language you learn at school
 Killer_Kat: I'm sad I missed out on going to school&#160;:(
 C26_1: But calling someone who read a lot of manga, anime as weed is very offended to some country and some people
 C26_1: word 'weebs'
 Killer_Kat: I'm in college now but my school has no language classes. 
 C26_1: oh, that's very weird actually
 Killer_Kat: Its a thing here in the states
 C26_1: nevermind, what foreign language have you learned?
 Killer_Kat: Espanol
 Killer_Kat: A small amount anyway
 C26_1: Oh, so Spain (in English)
 Killer_Kat: yes
 C26_1: I think the problem is Spain, you'll need to talk a little bit faster than normal
 Killer_Kat: Its funny because schools here do sometimes teach spanish 
 C26_1: And the most vowel that appears in speaking is 'a'
 Killer_Kat: yeah I can read pretty well but I cant keep up in conversations lol
 Killer_Kat: I need to practice more but I live in a remote area, literally in the woods. So I dont often talk with people
 C26_1: I've heard about infomation per characters. Is that true that some lang is harder because the info per character is larger?
 Killer_Kat: yeah
 C26_1: Wow, so Vietnamese is a pure skill
 therealbeef: programming languages are not necessarily in english because they come from US/UK. Python for example was invented in by a Dutch guy. it just made sense to use a simple well known natural language for the keywords
 C26_1: Because in order to develop Vietnamse, you'll need words
 Killer_Kat: Isnt python named after an english actors group?
 C26_1: Wait for me for seconds
 therealbeef: yeah, the inventor said he was in a funny mood and named it after monty python&#160;:)
 C26_1: Python is a high programming language for multi-programming and was developed and introduced in 1991 by Guido van Rossum
 Killer_Kat: damn, it feels so fresh and new and yet it is older than I am
 C26_1: In July, 2018, Rossum has resigned (Or give up his job) as the leadership in Python community
 C26_1: @Killer_Kat, learn somethings is never late, especially when you're young
 Killer_Kat: I wish I was younger
 Killer_Kat: I have wasted so much of my life
 C26_1: Oh, I can related to that
 Killer_Kat: Sadly I think A lot of people can. I still have not graduated college because I have depression and I couldnt get things done so I would fail classes, its taken me years and now I am almost done on a 2 year degree I should have finished 5 years ago
 Killer_Kat: I have to head to sleep, but I wish you all a goodnight
 C26_1: Wish you a goodnight and be luck in your iife
 C26_1: Stay tuned!
 C26_1: And, can I ask something?
 C26_1: What's BIO?
 Fasader: depends  on the context. could be biography or biology or biological or something completely different
 SpeedrunPVP: hi
 SpeedrunPVP: hi
 Xylight: if you are coding in java or js clash of code is almost inpossible... languages like python3 wins everytime
 5DN1L: unless you score higher than everyone else :P
 TeslaRam: almost impossible doesn't mean impossible, keep going, once u will win regularly
 5DN1L: exactly
 Xylight: but ther code is always shorter that is not even possible in js
 5DN1L: sometimes all your opponents can't score 100%
 TeslaRam: shortest mode isnt the only mode
 5DN1L: but you score 100%
 5DN1L: then you still win even if your code is longest
 Xylight: but less code more speed
 TeslaRam: try to learn another lannguage, for example if COC is easy, i try to do it in another language (mostly python3), u have 15 minutes, u can watch tutorial and still have time to write code in it
 Xylight: i often get 100% its just the problem of speed I need in java 5-10 lines and they can do it in 1-2 so i gonna learn p3 to have chances
 145Fps: How could i get any faster when reaching checkpoint, my pod keep getting outside the screen
 5DN1L: Getting faster won't help you if your pod gets outside the screen?
 145Fps: then how to prevent it from getting outside the screen
 145Fps: What is the optimal settimgs
 145Fps: settings*
 nesnes112: hi 
 nesnes112: i need ur help
 nesnes112: this is the link of the puzzle
 nesnes112: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures</a>
 nesnes112: and this is my code
 nesnes112: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06f7ee2d-f6d6-4ffd-a4c2-1063d0a106ea">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06f7ee2d-f6d6-4ffd-a4c2-1063d0a106ea</a>
 nesnes112: 90% is correct
 5DN1L: 145Fps  you're required to print your target coordinates and your thrust every turn, so if you print the coordinates within the bounds, you won't get outside the screen. and you can print a higher value of thrust to accelerate your pod
 nesnes112: it's this validator that doesn't workWhen two temperatures are as close to 0, then the positive wins 2: {15 7 9 14 -7 1
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: this is a US company, help center is closed today for the holiday
 145Fps: How can I do that
 5DN1L: 145Fps do what
 145Fps: What you said about printing target coordinates within the bounds
 5DN1L: that particular line of code should be somewhere near the end of the code
 145Fps: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " " + str(thrust))
 5DN1L: yes. so you have to adjust the values of those variables before they're printed
 145Fps: could you show me?
 5DN1L: next_checkpoint_x and next_checkpoint_y should not get you out of bounds though
 145Fps: Yes, but still happens sometimes
 5DN1L: are you in wood 2 league?
 145Fps: Wood 1
 5DN1L: ok
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: your frame rate is too high
 5DN1L: 145Fps, did you do as the hint suggested? adjust your thrust based on angle?
 145Fps: did it
 5DN1L: ok
 5DN1L: so now you got a new command
 5DN1L: BOOST
 5DN1L: you can use it only once
 145Fps: Ok
 145Fps: How can use it
 5DN1L: print it instead of thrust for one turn
 145Fps: Ok, do i rewrite my line of code i sent you earlier and replacing thrust by boost?
 darkhorse64: nesnes112: your code does not handle the case where you have -5 and 5 as inputs and you must select 5
 5DN1L: 145Fps, you modify the code which determines the thrust so that thrust == "BOOST" for one turn
 5DN1L: probably the first turn is the best
 darkhorse64: It will always return the temperature with the highest absolute value which is not the requirement
 145Fps: Didn't understood
 5DN1L: Currently you determine your thrust with reference to checkpoint angle, right?
 nesnes112: yes darkhose64
 145Fps: Yup
 5DN1L: Now, your task is to modify your code, to keep track of whether you have used BOOST before
 5DN1L: if not, set thrust to equal to "BOOST"
 YS_Yousef: hello! can u see my contribute?
 5DN1L: otherwise, determine thrust the same as before, 145Fps
 YS_Yousef: i want to get ur fead back
 YS_Yousef: to see if it is good or not
 5DN1L: YS_Yousef Yes we can, now please patiently wait
 nesnes112: darkhose64 i understand the validator
 YS_Yousef: 5DN1L ok thx!
 nesnes112: but i don't know how to code
 145Fps: Search for tutorial
 darkhorse64: Given your code sample, you surely do. Just think how you can select 5 over -5 (which test to apply)&#160;?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: YS_Yousef, I have bad news for you
 YS_Yousef: what?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: It isn't good
 YS_Yousef: i like it
 YS_Yousef: because it is short
 YS_Yousef: and ez to understand
 YS_Yousef: not like some contribute
 YS_Yousef: contributes
 YS_Yousef: any ways it is my first one
 darkhorse64: Trivial puzzles are mercilessly rejected
 YS_Yousef: and that was ur openion
 YS_Yousef: ok i will make another one good than this
 nesnes112: darkhorse64 I added the t&gt;0 test but still it doesn't work
 145Fps: 5dN1L
 145Fps: I still dont know how to put the boost
 145Fps: i work in python 3
 5DN1L: first do you understand what i mean?
 145Fps: Can you re explain?
 5DN1L: Your code currently sets thrust to 0 or 100 depending on the angle, right?
 145Fps: Yes
 5DN1L: Now on top of that you have to add a condition: if you have never used boost before, thrust = "BOOST"
 145Fps: Where should i put it
 5DN1L: put it where you determine thrust
 145Fps: Done
 5DN1L: does your code work?
 145Fps: Yes
 145Fps: i am first
 5DN1L: good
 145Fps: But i can't understand why
 145Fps: But it's very good now
 145Fps: Thanks
 5DN1L: because BOOST gives your pod a boost
 5DN1L: You're welcome
 145Fps: Yes i saw that
 145Fps:&#160;:)à
 145Fps:&#160;:)
 YS_Yousef: hi guys
 YS_Yousef: i made a new one
 YS_Yousef: and it is good
 145Fps: 5Dn1L
 YS_Yousef: (for me!)
 145Fps: How to make my pod
 145Fps: Faster in the angle
 Big_Code: Heya folks, would anyone have nudge on what to look into for ASCII Art? When I tried searching, most of my results were showing how to convert actual photos into ASCII art, would it be a similar process to complete the puzzle? Or is it much simpler
 145Fps: For now its thrust = 0
 145Fps: else
 145Fps: thrust = 100
 145Fps: and just after
 145Fps: thrust = "BOOST"
 5DN1L: Big_Code that puzzle is more about converting characters to their ASCII values and picking up the relevant portion of the corresponding representation from lists
 5DN1L: 145Fps Study the relevant forum topic to get some hints on how to improve your pod: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/mad-pod-racing-puzzle-discussion/1833">https://forum.codingame.com/t/mad-pod-racing-puzzle-discussion/1833</a>
 5DN1L: You may need some trigonometry and/or simulation eventually
 YS_Yousef: 5DN1L I know that you are busy but I need ur feed back in my "new" contribute the mario pyramids and bye&#160;:)
 Big_Code: Hmm 5DN1L, I'm not sure I follow 100%. So I need to take the 't' input, convert it to ASCII, then determine what part of the ASCII Art alphabet to pull from?
 5DN1L: Indeed I'm still very busy... There are many contributions pending approval and feedback, so please patiently wait, thanks. YS_Yousef
 YS_Yousef: welcome
 5DN1L: Big_Code Exactly
 Big_Code: Huh, sounds totally foreign to me but thats what learning is for :grin: Ty for the nudge 5DN1L :grin: 
 5DN1L: You're welcome&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: nesnes112: print both values you are testing and check whether your test gives the expected answer. If not, fix the test. You must select the largest absolute value and in case of equality, the biggest one
 Assasint: Hello Guys
 Uljahn: guess it should be the smallest absolute value (closest to zero)
 Assasint: Why 
 Assasint:  SO
 Big_Code: A lot of my searches are saying to use the module 'pyfiglet' but I'm getting a module not found error. 5DN1L is there a module you would recommend as a hint? I'm not sure where to start since most of my results include pyfiglet
 5DN1L: no module needed
 Big_Code: :thinking: hmm okay, thanks!
 Assasint: :money_mouth:
 darkhorse64: You are right, Uljahn. You must select the smallest absolute value and in case of equality, the biggest one
 Big_Code: This is driving me insane lmao, I just don't understand the goal of this puzzle. So I can  generate the ASCII Value of 't', but how in the world am I supposed to pull an E out of the supplied input from row? Every single search variation I've tried leads me to either pyfiglet, or someone just straight printing ASCII art. Do I have to hardcode the variable E = ###'\n'.. etc.&#160;? 
 5DN1L: don't search "ascii art" as that's not the relevant keyword here
 Big_Code: What would you suggest I search? I wish the puzzle made it a tad more clear since it references "ascii art" numerous times
 5DN1L: search what you want to achieve
 Big_Code: ,
 5DN1L: "ascii art" is just how the puzzle is "packaged"
 5DN1L: it doesn't describe what is required at all
 5DN1L: i've told you how to solve it
 5DN1L: search by looking at that direction
 5DN1L: e.g. how to convert characters to their ascii values
 5DN1L: how to use substrings
 5DN1L: how to use lists
 5DN1L: those types of stuff
 Big_Code: Yes, I've converted the characters to ascii values as I said
 Big_Code: But the puzzle expects an "Ascii art" responce
 Big_Code: so how would I not search up "how to convert text input to ascii art"
 5DN1L: it could be described as "ascii art" or whatever you want really
 Big_Code: "​Your mission is to write a program that can display a line of text in ASCII art in a style you are given as input."
 5DN1L: i could describe it as "a magnified display of characters"
 5DN1L: i could describe it as "an ugly way to show characters"
 5DN1L: i could describe it a thousand ways
 5DN1L: (maybe)
 5DN1L: but whatever way of description, it's irrelevant to how you SOLVE the puzzle
 Big_Code: What would you say is the condition to solve this puzzle then?
 Big_Code: In my eyes, its to print an ascii art version of the input provided
 5DN1L: told you a few minutes ago
 5DN1L: you need lists
 5DN1L: you need substrings
 5DN1L: and way much earlier
 5DN1L: you've already repeated my approach in your own words
 5DN1L: read that again
 darkhorse64: :popcorn:
 5DN1L: and hint: ascii value can be converted to corresponding position of the required substrings easily
 5DN1L: yay popcorn
 5DN1L: :D

 Loek_OPENICT: Consider the momentum of your pod when deciding where to aim your move&#160;:)
 jacek: the code should always be 7 bit, add zeroes if needed
 SMOKEz8z8: ah that's the trick&#160;:) thx
 5DN1L: "7 bits" should be in bold red large font size lol Lots of people get stuck because of that
 SMOKEz8z8: well, it's hard enough without it&#160;:) took me long enough to figure out how to count the repeating characters.
 SMOKEz8z8: could not get it going with for loops, but got it going with while loops
 5DN1L: heehee many approaches to this puzzle really
 5DN1L: keep going! SMOKEz8z8
 SMOKEz8z8:&#160;:( my solutions are always alot of lines, then you check the solution with the most votes... only one line of code, that I dont even understant

 Quidome: 7 ply dfs with iterative deepening
 Quidome: That was fun&#160;:)
 5DN1L: SMOKEz8z8 Not much to add really, just wonder if you know you can use "+=" if you add a substring to the end (but not to the front)?
 jacek: snake?
 SMOKEz8z8: was looking at the solutions, quickly realized, I was using += for other values, did not realize I could use them for strings...
 SMOKEz8z8: also learned zfill from one of them

 5DN1L: c=="1"!=b -&gt; True
 5DN1L: c="0"; b="1"
 5DN1L: c=="1"!=b -&gt; False
 5DN1L: something to do with operator precedence...

 Jay_minecraft: # Edit this line to output the target position
 5DN1L: do you know coordinates?
 Jay_minecraft: Nope
 5DN1L: then it's difficult...
 jacek: youre printing y y
 Jay_minecraft:&#160;?
 5DN1L: we can tell him the answer, but he may not understand what that means :shrug:
 Jay_minecraft: #younglad
 5DN1L: not an age issue
 5DN1L: it's an issue of how much maths you've learned
 Jay_minecraft: I know
 Jay_minecraft: I have math first thing in the in the morning.
 Jay_minecraft: For school
 5DN1L: if you really want to solve the puzzle, search and read about basics of coordinate geometry
 Nachosauce: In this case, x is left/right, y is up/down on the screen.
 Jay_minecraft: I might try googling the answer
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it may also be another case of fetal alcohol syndrome.  is your upper lip unusually small?
 jacek: oO
 Nachosauce: If you do that, don't copy/paste&#160;:) try to see what it's doing and re-write it for practice.
 Jay_minecraft: Mrs.Gloria what?
 5DN1L: never mind that
 Wontonimo: she likes to be called Westicals 
 jacek: try print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 50")
 Nicora: freaking nerds, imma crush yall in codin game
 Nicora: jk love you all
 Nachosauce: Crush me real good. You can do it! I believe in you
 Wontonimo: Nicora's gonna crush on you Nachosauce
 5DN1L: have a crush on him? nooooo
 Wontonimo: you'll be crushed nacho sauce
 Nachosauce: It is what it is
 Wontonimo: true dat
 Jay_minecraft: This is hard lol
 Wontonimo: which puzzle&#160;?
 Jay_minecraft: Mad pod
 5DN1L: and he hasn't learned anything about coordinates yet
 Jay_minecraft: As always
 Nachosauce: Jumping in the deep end is always a fun way to learn&#160;:) Keep poking away and googling and asking questions (after googling)
 Jay_minecraft: My guy i am always so tired life sucks when you have to wake up at 6:00 in the morning 
 Wontonimo: ha.  what level are you IRL Jay?
 Wontonimo: have you finished the IRL tutorial yet?
 Jay_minecraft: Then walk for 15 minutes  
 Nachosauce: I feel you my dude. I get up at 4:30, exercise, go to work, come home, take care of my daughter, sleep. But gotta squeeze that codingame in where you can :grin:
 Jay_minecraft: Y'all going to laugh at me bro
 Jay_minecraft: :disappointed:
 5DN1L: i'm not
 jacek: 1 2 7 3 down to rockefeller street ~

 Jay_minecraft: bruh what is this video??
 Nachosauce: Jay_minecraft don't feel bad, it's easier to learn when you're young so get on it now, get lots of practice! keep at it. It's worth it
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Is that age appropriate for an 11yo?
 Wontonimo:&#160;:( oops
 Jay_minecraft: i am 12 
 Apollo10: Ghost in the cell, Cyborg uprising (one of the other games on codingame)
 Wontonimo: oh, that's fine then
 Jay_minecraft: Not 11
 Wontonimo: why you stirring up trouble Gloria&#160;?
 Jay_minecraft: :upside_down:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I thought he was 11.5... no prob
 Jay_minecraft: trouble?
 Wontonimo: what language are you using jay?
 Jay_minecraft: No trouble
 Wontonimo: (plz don't say english)
 Jay_minecraft: Python3
 jacek: english
 Wontonimo: I'll send you some links to some python stuff

 Wontonimo: wdym?
 Corvus001: i see this codingame spring challenge and i was wandering what is all about
 Corvus001: *wondering
 Wontonimo: there is a description and write up
 Wontonimo: and a preview 
 Corvus001: where can i see the description
 Corvus001:&#160;?

 Wontonimo: to be honest, i've wasted 2 days playing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgreghenry.github.io/A-Mazing-Idle/">https://imgreghenry.github.io/A-Mazing-Idle/</a> , following my WFC getting final approval, and showing people my mining prototype game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://panchishin.github.io/rogue/maze.html">https://panchishin.github.io/rogue/maze.html</a>
 Nachosauce: Working on my pod racing 
 Nachosauce: I see idle. I'm down.
 Wontonimo: the the idle game called a-mazing-idle, get to having 1 bot upgrade then paste this into the debugger and then just let it run for 10 hours by itself and it will be mostly done

 Wontonimo: i've certainly shied away
 Wontonimo: hey Nachosauce, how far are you in mad pod racing?  I happen to know some tricks if you want some help
 Wontonimo: hello duck_man
 Nachosauce: Rank 335
 struct: Wontonimo i would not put the bot to auto move after i complete the level
 struct: on the idle game
 Nachosauce: score still calculating though
 Wontonimo: i what league Nachosauce&#160;?
 Nachosauce: legend
 struct: i have to press a key just to disable it when i go up a level
 Wontonimo: ah, then you are ahead of me.  I was once 75... but we won't talk abouut that
 Thorcode: wow
 Thorcode: Nacho sauce can you help me
 Nachosauce: I can try :D
 struct: what search do you use Nachosauce?
 Wontonimo: I'm curious also
 Nachosauce: I simulate some random possibilities, and tweak them measuring how effective they are until I'm about to timeout, then spit out the best of the bunch. I don't know all the fancy termonology
 Wontonimo: so, kinda liike a genetic algorithm, in that there is mutation in the population
 Nachosauce: ohh I like it. Makes me sound fancy
 Wontonimo: and selection
 Wontonimo: do you know about GA (genetic algorithm) search?
 Nachosauce: Not really, though it sounds like my solution is pretty darn tootin similar
 Thorcode: how
 Wontonimo: Well you can see a quick demo here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYFz03Cg3-A">https://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYFz03Cg3-A</a> and see some source here github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm
 Wontonimo: hmm, that didn't work
 Wontonimo: video here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYFz03Cg3-A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYFz03Cg3-A</a>
 Wontonimo: code here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm">https://github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm</a>
 Wontonimo: how did you come up with your solution Nachosauce&#160;?
 struct: 1 day ill learn ga
 Nachosauce: started with me doing shitty "simulations" (adding my velocity to my position) a few times to see if I'd hit the checkpoint in the next few turns, and if so target the next checkpoint instead. Then that didn't get me to legend so I threw that out and went to the drawing board with a lot of caffeine and undone chores. 
 Wontonimo: nice story
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: is this going where I think it is?  
 Wontonimo: what data structure do you store that is "tweak"ed&#160;?
 Nachosauce: The first thing was enough to almost get me to legend though. Usually landed in top 10 gold lol. Spent a lot of time trying to make little tweaks thinking "oh I'll re-write everything after I get legend" and yeah. Days of tweaks later, I gave up.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: leave him alone!  he's a typical brilliant american who just derived the algorithm from first principles!
 Wontonimo: I'm having a nice conversation and you taint it with "leave him alone"&#160;?  wth Westicles Gloria&#160;?
 Wontonimo: anyway...
 Wontonimo: that's really cool Nachosauce
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh, I thought you were challenging him on his story
 Nachosauce: I have a set number of possible solutions (a few turns worth of viable outputs) that start randomized, simulate wheresabouts that should end me up, give it a score, 'randomly' tweak rotation, thrust etc, simulate again. so on until I'm close to timeout and use the highest scoring one
 Wontonimo: do you use a gaussian random tweak?
 Nachosauce: I'd have to google what that means, so I'll go with a solid maybe while I go google :joy:
 Wontonimo: haha..  okay so 1 6sided dice has 1/6th chance for each outcome.
 Nachosauce: ah, the tweaks are weighted a bit. not even chances.
 Wontonimo: 2 6sided dice rolled and added together, if you look at the chance of each total it is 1/36 for a total of 2 , 2/36 for a total of 3 , etc
 Wontonimo: oh ...
 Wontonimo: interesting.
 Wontonimo: a couple things that really helped my selection Nachosauce is that i first start with a preset of values that represents straight ahead at full power, then compare it to preset values of a hard left
 Wontonimo: then a hard right
 Wontonimo: then random
 Wontonimo: the best one then becomes the one that i tweak 
 Wontonimo: it helped a lot
 Nachosauce: Oh I like that
 Wontonimo: well, i said it was a couple of things, but it's just one 
 Nachosauce: You could totally stretch that out into 3 if you wanted
 Wontonimo: yeah, lets pretend
 Wontonimo: i've also heard people priming the values with a heuristic, like -3v, then evolving that
 Wontonimo: so you could add that as the 5th thing.  straight, left, right, heuristic, random, pick best, then tweak
 Wontonimo: how do you search the opponents response to your action?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: nacho, as your appointed lawyer I advise you not to answer that
 Wontonimo: lol
 Nachosauce: As an american, it is my duty to go against my lawyers advice and make a fool of myself
 Nachosauce: Honestly I just look at their position/velocity and try to guesstimate if we're likely to collide. If so, try to calculate the collision 
 Wontonimo: oh, so the opponent is pure heuristic
 Wontonimo: and doesn't use the tweaking code you have
 Nachosauce: yeah I don't do anything fancy with their pods. pretty much just checking for likely collisions and using their location to help determine the score of a possible solution
 Wontonimo: I use the same code for the opponent.  The opponent first gets evolved using GA for 15% of the time budget, then my pods get the remaining 85% to counter
 Wontonimo: my search depth is 10 frames
 Nachosauce: That's probably much better than what I have, but way more work than I'm willing to do :joy: My goal was legend, now I'm just poking for funsies
 Wontonimo: that's fantastic that you made it to legend!
 struct: you can always add a blocker
 struct: it will boost your rank to top 100 if done successfully 
 Wontonimo: I actually don't have code specifically for the "runner" or "blocker"
 struct: not even your eval?
 Wontonimo: wait ... i'm wrong&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: there are a few lines.
 Wontonimo: yeah, just in the eval
 Wontonimo: why would you want to use GA struct?
 struct: well its something i dont know yet
 Thorcode: I think I need to get to legend in mad, gold suck now
 Nachosauce: youu caan dooo iiiit
 Thorcode: but I am lazy
 Wontonimo: here is a simple way to get into it quick.  make a list of 10 random points on a 100x100 grid.  try to solve the traveling salesmen problem.  Initially your salesmen will travel from the first point on the list to the last in order, in a straight line
 Wontonimo: the "fitness" function is the total distance traveled.
 Wontonimo: initialize the "population" of 100 salesmen by shuffling the order of the points for each salesmen
 Wontonimo: define a mutation as something like, the salesmen will swap the order of their of their points at random
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: that gets thor into legend?
 Thorcode: how
 Wontonimo: define a crossover as two salesmen get together, use the first half of the values from one of the salesmen, and remove those falues from the second, and append them
 Wontonimo: then order all the salesmen by fitness (lowest distance first)
 Thorcode: I need to start with greedy algo first to solve sales man problem
 Wontonimo: throw out all but the first 100, and repeat
 Wontonimo: when you mutate, it makes a new salesmen (the mutant), and when you crossover it creates a new salesmen
 Wontonimo: also
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: thor, I think he means you sell one of your pods
 Wontonimo: that's all there is to it really
 Thorcode: ah ok
 Thorcode: I sold one of my pod
 Thorcode: ez
 Thorcode: kicked him from the race
 Wontonimo: here is an example of "solving" the traveling salesmen problem with GA <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm/blob/master/examples/travelingSalesmen.js">https://github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm/blob/master/examples/travelingSalesmen.js</a> 
 Thorcode: you know js?
 Thorcode: yep probably you code this
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's my code
 Wontonimo: i grew it myself from a wee little seed.  planted it, watered it, protected it from weasels 
 Thorcode: My target is winning bot in mad now
 struct: some progress <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Ga2Sxo9.gif">https://i.imgur.com/Ga2Sxo9.gif</a>
 Thorcode: ah
 struct: Didnt have too much time today
 Wontonimo: okay, a way easier problem is to guess a few numbers
 Wontonimo: have a list of 5 numbers in an array.
 Wontonimo: ... anyway ...
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I don't think struct knew that TSP stuff was for him
 struct: o.o
 struct: was it for me Wontonimo?
 struct: im sorry
 Wontonimo: yeah, it was
 Wontonimo: that's okay
 struct: ill read it now
 Wontonimo: it's okay buddy
 zophia2222: oj

 zophia2222: lol
 Wontonimo: somehow
 zophia2222: okkkkkkojjjjj
 Thorcode: I prefer coffeee 
 Thorcode: can someone help me the drifting part in mad?
 Nachosauce: The way I had it which isn't too bad to implement and almost got me to legend before my re-write, is I looped adding my velocity to my position ~5 times checking my distance to the checkpoint at each stage. If I got within a certain threshold, I'd switch my target to the next checkpoint and slow down based on the angle to the next checkpoint. Not super accurate, but was accurate enough to help a ton
 Nachosauce: Also, goodnight everyone. love ya'll
 Thorcode: gn
 Thorcode: player in mad are better now
 Wontonimo: gn Nachosauce

 zophia2222: plz shush
 Flaise: I really enjoyed jdhygryewe when it first came out but it didn't age well. I saw it again last week and could only think that, well... technology has come a long way.

 jacek: good morning
 gsomix: good morning, jacek 
 Gloryness: good morning, i got to go to school in like 2 minutes lol
 Shihab_BD: hey
 AntiSquid: hey no clash of code links spam please, click #clash and do it there Gv RachRay 
 jacek: perhaps the chat should censor those links
 emysito: hello world
 emysito: :wq
 UndisclosedBeastAndHisDog_820d: how are you all?ðŸ˜Š
 Saptarshi: Yo bros
 Saptarshi: can anyone teach me Binary Tree
 sheikh18: non linear data structrure
 Saptarshi: I know
 jacek: [solved]
 Saptarshi: but teach me the application
 sheikh18: it is used in databases management
 sheikh18: for optimization of query
 Saptarshi: sql?
 WINWINWIN: Awesome... contest details out.
 jacek: the november one?
 Albab: hi friends
 Saptarshi: Fall Challenge?
 G._ROSYADI: dont break my world break my pussy
 Ventex: hold up
 WINWINWIN: Jacek, yeah, I wasnt online for some time... dont know when it came out.
 jacek: codingame is like vim: i cant quit
 MrPianoman: VIM is only useful for generating random strings (by users unable to quit VIM)
 DJSunnyOctopus_6c0c: hi everyone
 sugam: how to get codinpoints
 jrke: by doing clash of code,bot programming, code golf and optimization
 sugam: I did code golf and i am not getting codinpoints
 DomiKo: you have to wait
 sugam: how much time?
 jrke: it updates once a day
 jrke: maybe at 0:00 UTC
 sugam: i hope it's not a troll
 jrke: no its truth
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/">http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/</a>
 DomiKo: here you can check your points NOW
 MSmits: hi guys
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 jacek: are you hyped for the contest
 MSmits: meh, hyped more for D&amp;B&#160;:)
 MSmits: got some success today
 eulerscheZahl: still 2 months, no hype yet
 MSmits: that true
 MSmits: too
 Illedan: HYPE
 MSmits: I'll be doing that contest from a bigger room
 MSmits: will be painting all weekend&#160;:(
 Illedan: 8 days vacation :check:
 Illedan: :checkmark:
 eulerscheZahl: double fail
 eulerscheZahl: do it like Mr Bean, MSmits
 MSmits: what'd he do again?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9MAmWnOznI&amp;ab_channel=MrBean">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9MAmWnOznI&amp;ab_channel=MrBean</a>
 MSmits: seems effective
 jacek: what about that community contest
 jacek: it starts in 2 days
 MSmits: it's not really a community contest I think?
 MSmits: it's like a school sponsored contest?
 MSmits: prizes for students, not for us
 MSmits: but you can join
 MSmits: I'm not going to, I'll be doing the mr bean thing. Just gotta find some illegal fireworkds
 DomiKo: wiat
 DomiKo: wait
 DomiKo: there are prizes?
 MSmits: for students
 MSmits: for that particular course
 DomiKo: any student?
 MSmits: not you
 MSmits: it's some AI course
 DomiKo: ohhh ok
 sugam: I'm one of the student
 MSmits: cool
 sugam: but i don't know how this site works
 MSmits: you'll learn soon enough, it's not complicated
 MSmits: the coding can be though
 sugam: how do i get codinpoints
 jacek: bribery
 sugam: i did couple of code golf 
 MSmits: competitive stuff
 jacek: :soccer:
 MSmits: code golf does give some, if you're ranked high enough
 MSmits: but it updates at night
 MSmits: so you wont see it till tomorrow
 sugam: ohhhhhhh that's whyyyy
 MSmits: multiplayer arena's give more CP though
 sugam: what type of problems do we get in the competition
 MSmits: but the programs tend to be large. Somewhere between 300 and 1500 lines each
 sugam: AT competition
 MSmits: same as multiplayer arena's in general I guess
 MSmits: if it's separated into leagues, there's a chance you start with simple rules
 MSmits: requiring simple heuristics
 MSmits: as more rules get added, the game becomes more complicated to code for
 sugam: where do i find Multiplayer arena
 MSmits: in the end the meta will have bots with highly performant search algorithms
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits got the link faster than me&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: your "contest" will be one of the games listed there
 Astrobytes: I've simply given up
 sugam: I want to get familiar with the environment I'll be having in tomorrow's contest 
 sugam: and I don't know a thing about AI
 sugam: I'm a fresher and I know some DS and simple algorithms
 MSmits: hmm maybe try ghost in the cell?
 MSmits: seems a good gamble to practice before an unknown contest?
 sugam: so the contest has one of the already existing games?
 MSmits: no
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: usually it's a ripoff&#160;:)
 sugam: won't they create their won game?
 MSmits: if its a school sponsored contest
 eulerscheZahl: for a real contest: original content
 sugam: school sponsored
 eulerscheZahl: the school contest is an old game
 Astrobytes: He means does the unofficial contest use an existing game MSmits
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but it's never exactly the same is it?
 sugam: they got prize money too
 MSmits: it's dangerous to let it be exactly the same
 sugam: if it's possible to cheat then what's the point
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits it's really just promoting an existing multiplayer
 eulerscheZahl: we know about github
 Astrobytes: MSmits, it's not a CG one, just unofficial, like thibpat's one for PR2
 MSmits: if there's prize money, the top 1 of the particular leaderboard can sell their bot
 sugam: lmao
 jacek: hmm
 knight212: hi
 sugam: so it's not going to be fair 
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they ask for a presentation about the AI
 MSmits: sugam dont worry
 MSmits: it's probably going to be at least somewhat different
 eulerscheZahl: to counter the most obvious cheating at least
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: It's judged via a different leaderboard
 LoukasPap: :space_invader:
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah, but if the game is exactly the same, that doesnt matter
 Moctrof: you can only win prize with you are part of their school I thikn
 Astrobytes: Yes
 sugam: I'm part of the school
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits a bit different would require additional effort from someone. staff, if it's an older game. unlikely to happen
 MSmits: if there's a lot of prize money, it might be worth it?
 sugam: It's less likely that anyone from our school actually knew about this site
 Moctrof: prize will be a t shirt
 MSmits: o
 Moctrof: lol
 MSmits: then I am not worried&#160;:)
 sugam: it's not much $500 usd
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: yeah top players from CG wont care enough to cheat and sell their code for that much
 sugam: then I'm relived a bit?
 MSmits: 10x that and I'd be worried
 Astrobytes: prizes - not prize money
 MSmits: sugam says it's 500 
 Moctrof: I sell you my code
 MSmits: he's from the school
 Moctrof: but I suck
 Astrobytes: I see it, chat hung for a moment
 sugam: No I just want it to be fair
 MSmits: sugam it will never be perfectly fair, but dont worry about people selling code
 Astrobytes: Don't worry
 sugam: so help me get started to prepare
 MSmits: the unfairness will mostly be differences in available time. Some of your fellow students will code day and night
 Astrobytes: The discord channel suggested to do puzzles and try CSB
 eulerscheZahl: also note: these are old contests. you can find writeups on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. for the last contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113</a>
 MSmits: but dont practice that one
 eulerscheZahl: lots of ideas without sharing actual code
 Moctrof: let's team
 Moctrof: ahah
 Moctrof: I do the coding style
 sugam: haha
 sugam: No thank you it's alright m8
 darkhorse64: There is a nice multi in the works: Penguins. It could solve fairness problems. BTW, it has hexes and it can be bitboarded
 eulerscheZahl: the last 2 are great selling arguments for freshmen
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I promised the fox I would test Penguins soon
 darkhorse64: and for MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: hey, just saw this contribution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/543277361e1c19142b907271303db1031b34">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/543277361e1c19142b907271303db1031b34</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i like the title
 MSmits: penguins are fun
 Hjax: good morning
 eulerscheZahl: good afternoon to you as well
 Astrobytes: good afternoon
 Hjax: no it cant be afternoon, i havent had my coffee yet :P
 darkhorse64: I made a toy bot for the 2 levels and I wonder if the push feature is really a nice idea. It changes completely the meta and make the fishing part quite irrelevant
 darkhorse64: It may be also a case of stupid bots
 jacek: hex AND bitboard? what else? opening book!?
 Astrobytes: It just becomes a push-fest?
 darkhorse64: No, sorry. Yes and I think it's an issue
 darkhorse64: But I may be wrong
 Astrobytes: I would have thought the combination of fishing and aggression would have worked
 jacek: but its a port of some popular game&#160;:?
 Astrobytes: Will need to play it to find out I guess
 darkhorse64: I don't think the push is part of the rules. At least not from my google searches
 darkhorse64: My concern is that aggression takes over. In 4 player games, it's hard to defend on such a small (and decreasing) board
 sugam: this code challenge requiring least characters is so flawed 
 darkhorse64: golf&#160;?
 sugam: will this type of challenges be in the contest? 
 darkhorse64: no
 sugam: I'm so confused 
 Astrobytes: Hmm, yeah the diminishing board size would definitely contribute to that issue
 sugam: how to prepare for this
 darkhorse64: Practicing. Don't worry, I have been a complete noob too
 Astrobytes: sugam - the contest will be a multiplayer bot programming challenge, not golf
 sugam: I did bot programming
 sugam: the first one where we have to race
 jacek: csb?
 Astrobytes: You reached Legend league in CSB already?&#160;;)
 sugam: and then I got stuck at the bronze 
 jacek: rock football?
 MadKnight: was it ezpz&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol
 sugam: haha
 MadKnight: no u gotta make it ezpz
 eulerscheZahl: see what you've done Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Hey don't blame me :P
 MadKnight: it's all your fault Astrobytes
 MadKnight: euler said so
 sugam: ah so we practice bot programming and that's it?
 Astrobytes: Sure, pick a game and try it out, see how far you get
 Astrobytes: Plenty to choose from
 jacek: eeyup
 sugam: so the contest will have the already existing games right
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: One of them
 sugam: how many are there
 MSmits: yeah you can try boardgames or inferior games, whatever you like :P
 sugam: sorry if i'm being annoying 
 Astrobytes: A few:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 MSmits: np
 wlesavo: csb contest would be fun :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: meh
 sugam: csb I'm at bronze 
 MSmits: hmm, csb and no neural networks allowed?
 MSmits: interesting...
 Astrobytes: Whatever it is, I think it's cool Crypticsy (?) organised it for his university
 sugam: i know nothing about AI
 sugam: if else
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, neither did I when I started here
 Astrobytes: If else will get you far
 sugam: haha, indeed 
 Astrobytes: (in a lot of games - not all)
 darkhorse64: Code A La Mode is a giant if else
 sugam: what are the basic prerequisites for the bot programming challenges? 
 eulerscheZahl: you got the trick already<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/aOYA1mE">https://9gag.com/gag/aOYA1mE</a>
 darkhorse64: If you want to be smart, you say it's a state machine
 Astrobytes: No real prerequisites other than being reasonably competent in a language
 sugam: i know bit of a java
 Astrobytes: If you know Java better than anything else, use it. You'll learn new stuff along the way most probably
 sugam: all i know is java. I know python but not much
 Hjax: java is decent for contests
 Hjax: depending on the game ofc
 Astrobytes: Java it is then. Keep a tab open for Google, and a tab open for SO and you're good to go&#160;;)
 sugam: SO?
 Astrobytes: stackoverflow
 sugam: ahh, yeah 
 Hjax: the tome of knowledge for all programmers
 Crypticsy: a lofi channel on the side?
 sugam: stackoverflow preserves the programming knowledge of entire human race, 
 Astrobytes: and all their mistakes :P
 Hjax: im super excited for this contest
 Astrobytes: I never noticed :D
 Hjax: contests are the only thing that properly motivate me it seems 
 sugam: you're from the school, Hjax?
 Hjax: i am not
 x544D: Hello
 Hjax: i am someone who has brief bursts of programming passion, and then quits for months at a time 
 Crypticsy: couldn't relate more XD
 sugam: ahaha so none of yours real job is coding?
 Hjax: mine is, but its kind of different from fun coding 
 darkhorse64: +1
 Astrobytes: Mine isn't, just a nice hobby
 Hjax: yeah lots of hobby programmers here
 Hjax: MSmits is another
 Astrobytes: though he does teach a computing class now
 Hjax: im kind of curious how competitive the people from the college are going to be with the regulars on this site
 Astrobytes: Are they all from the same year or varied?
 Crypticsy: varied
 Astrobytes: cool
 Hjax: maybe some hotshot will sign up and beat us all up :D
 Astrobytes: I guess some of them could be very competitive then
 Astrobytes: not unheard of!
 Crypticsy: Hope so too
 Astrobytes: Well done for organising it, pretty cool thing to do for your college
 eulerscheZahl: did you check for bots on github in regards to your game choice?
 Astrobytes: woah, yeah, good point
 Hjax: last unofficial contest no one managed to dethrone the #1 (re curse)
 darkhorse64: Yeah avoid Hypersonic, CodeBusters, CodeOfKutulu
 darkhorse64: and maybe others
 Crypticsy: i haven't, still waiting for a higher database to finalize the game
 eulerscheZahl: we can easily extend this list darkhorse64
 Crypticsy: good point, i will do it then, let me check. But i don't want to chose a category that will be hard for the new players either
 Crypticsy: choose*
 darkhorse64: These are multis for which there exists top bots. I don't count the myriad of bronze bots
 darkhorse64: BackToTheCode, GameOfDrones
 eulerscheZahl: both have public bots around top10-top20
 Hjax: isnt there a user who just copy pastes from github? just avoid games where hes high ranked 
 darkhorse64: That's what I meant
 eulerscheZahl: was about to suggest that
 Hjax: its anid right? 
 darkhorse64: yes
 eulerscheZahl: anid or shiardeOussama
 Hjax: huh, that guy copy pastes too? didnt know that 
 eulerscheZahl: *SihardeOussama
 Astrobytes: didn't know that second one
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/478018253">https://www.codingame.com/replay/478018253</a>that game isn't perfectly symmetric&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm convinced it's the same bot
 Hjax: you can catch cheaters if you know the public top bot 
 darkhorse64: His CP profile does not look suspicious
 eulerscheZahl: siharde?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl seems the same yeah
 eulerscheZahl: at some point there was an external site that allowed you to check which language you used to solve a puzzle
 MSmits: also the bot itself might not be perfectly p1/p2 symmetric
 MSmits: start two games
 MSmits: with players switched
 eulerscheZahl: compared that user with another cheater. both used a fair margin of different languages for community puzzles. the same in most cases
 eulerscheZahl: and surprise: the problem author used the same
 MSmits: do you mean the player copied the authors solution because of contribution access?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: That's just weak. I mean, why even bother?
 MSmits: agreed
 Hjax: how many languages people use for multis is an interesting topic, ive used 3: python3, rust, and java
 eulerscheZahl: 2: C#, C++
 darkhorse64: 1
 eulerscheZahl: let's compile stats for top100 or so :D
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid: a dozen of D bots :rofl:
 MSmits: c++ for simple games, C# for complex ones, but lately I started using c++ for those too
 Astrobytes: only C++ for multis for me
 MSmits: i did pacman in c++
 Hjax: my pacman was java and i regret it
 darkhorse64: C++
 Hjax: i regret many things about pacman though 
 Astrobytes: I regret starting it
 eulerscheZahl: i regret fog
 Astrobytes: (not really, but it wasn't my favourite)
 darkhorse64: I regret all 
 MSmits: you gave a heroic try though Hjax, and don't forget to divide your rank by 3 to account for players competing
 MSmits: there were soooo many contestants
 Hjax: the game was just so frustrating 
 Hjax: and im still pretty disappointed with my result :P
 MSmits: hmm, it was hard to figure out a good strategy. Lots of trial and error
 MSmits: that's why i prefer board games. A lot of the time, the stuff that makes sense, also works
 MSmits: in pacman, stuff that made sense, did not necessarily work&#160;:)
 DomiKo: C++ gives you that advantage, that you don't really have to care about performance
 Hjax: at one point i was 200 ranks below the boss, and going even with the boss in my testing 
 MSmits: ah yeah thats frustrating
 MSmits: I bet you boosted lots of players
 Marchete: #pragma GCC optimize("O0") go brrrr
 Marchete: hello MSmits
 DomiKo: now you feel python programers
 MSmits: hi Marchete
 Marchete: I'm struggling with bitboards
 MSmits: you need to love them
 MSmits: dont struggle
 Marchete: but I think I finally got the degree calculation on boxes
 MSmits: whats that exactly?
 MSmits: do you mean the chain counting technique from the papers?
 Marchete: boxes ordered by edges
 Marchete: chain counting?
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Marchete: not yet :D
 MSmits: ah yeah thats a thing, whether you want chaincounts to be even or odd
 Marchete: I mean, from Hedges and Vedges
 MSmits: never bothered with that
 MSmits: wait what
 MSmits: hedges and veggies?
 Marchete: horizontal and vertical edges
 Marchete: I mean edges
 MSmits: ohhhh
 Marchete: calculate boxes by number of edges
 MSmits: i thought you were losing it
 MSmits: but what do you calculate
 Marchete: lots of XOR's and bitwise operations...
 MSmits: do you calculate whether you can take them?
 MSmits: or whether they are twice connected?
 Marchete: i mean
 Hjax: i hope the fall contest is fun, so i can stop griping about pacman :P 
 MSmits: you mean you can pick a different game for this Hjax?
 MSmits: oh wait you said fun
 Marchete: on a chain, boxes[2] will be a uint64_t with all the boxes with 2 edges
 Marchete: boxes[3] with 3
 Marchete: and so on
 MSmits: ahhh
 MSmits: wanna see my poorly named variables for this?
 Marchete: you posted a line about how to get boxes with 2 edges 
 Marchete: I tried to guess how, I can't :D
 Marchete: I just redo all
 MSmits: I have a bitboard for vertical lines and horizontal lines
 darkhorse64: :scream:
 MSmits: I do this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4a19cbf3-830f-4235-ac33-8391fb120df7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4a19cbf3-830f-4235-ac33-8391fb120df7</a>
 Marchete: probably similar
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa4d205a-7fc0-4ee8-b435-f9f74b57e932">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa4d205a-7fc0-4ee8-b435-f9f74b57e932</a>
 Marchete: but I see much less operations in yours
 MSmits: well it's at least equally hard to understand whats going on :P
 Marchete: I struggle a LOT
 Marchete: to get 1 and 3 to work
 MSmits: I used Xor for 0,2,4
 Marchete: 0 and 4? 
 MSmits: if you xor all edges together
 darkhorse64: Are you aware that exposing young kids to such code is probably illegal&#160;?
 MSmits: if it gives 0 it's either a 0, 2 or 4 edge box
 MSmits: if it's 1  it's either a 1, 3 box
 Marchete: 0 is just a lot of ANDs
 MSmits: lol darkhorse64
 Marchete: and 4 is the opposite
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: so 2 is left if you do the xor thing
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: but the 1 and 3 was tricky
 MSmits: so thats how i do ti
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: I did with (a|b)^(c|d)
 MSmits: 			uint64_t doubleHor = ~(hor | horShifted) &amp; FULL_BOARD;;			uint64_t doubleVer = ~(ver | verShifted) &amp; FULL_BOARD;;			uint64_t threeBoxes = (doubleHor ^ doubleVer) &amp; xorBoxes &amp; FULL_BOARD;
 MSmits: probably similar
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: yeah its the same
 MSmits: i just &amp; with fullboard
 MSmits: not sure if it is necessary here
 MSmits: but you might end up turning on some extra bits that are outside of the board
 Marchete: well, "fullboard" is inUse for me
 MSmits: oh ok
 Marchete: because it's just a continuation
 Marchete: but inUse starts as FULLBOARD, yes
 MSmits: right, so we probably do the same
 Marchete: \o/
 MSmits: whats the problem you're having now then?
 MSmits: in my case, this part of the code is really not the bottleneck
 Marchete: oh, nothing. I just wanna say it to you
 Marchete: it was an achievement for me
 MSmits: oh ok, well it's nicely done, this is not easy
 MSmits: i do it all the time and I struggled here too
 Marchete: I think about bitboarding I have the big stuff
 Marchete: also a for loop()
 Marchete: for both edges and boxes
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: what does the for loop do?
 Marchete: iterate on each active bit
 Marchete: but as a for loop
 Marchete: not while(xxx){ }
 MSmits: ahh 
 Marchete: and doing stuff at the end
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9344e4af-fdf9-489a-ad96-2ecaed65a929">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9344e4af-fdf9-489a-ad96-2ecaed65a929</a>
 MSmits: my function for making random boards
 MSmits: endgames that is
 MSmits: i just fill it up randomly
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: i dont think i need everything i am calculating there
 Marchete: nice, it can be useful
 MSmits: this is for offline testing for my solver
 MSmits: it can do 1k games in 1.3 seconds now
 MSmits: which seems great, but then the slowest still takes a tenth of that time :P
 Marchete: hmm, your horizontal mask is my vertical mask and viceversa
 Marchete: const uint64_t MASK_V_EDGE = 0x7F7F7F7F7F7F7F7FULL;const uint64_t MASK_H_EDGE = 0x00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
 MSmits: funny
 MSmits: yeah i guess the bitboard is defined somewhat differently then
 MSmits: it would make my head hurt to think about how exactly, so not gonna try
 Marchete: no no
 Marchete: neither me :D
 Marchete: those A1 from bottom left are messy
 MSmits: tbh, i havent touched this part of the code in 2 weeks
 MSmits: just been doing graph stuff
 MSmits: I discovered something really neat today
 MSmits: you can completely ignore all independent chains of size &gt;= 4 and all loops of size &gt;= 8
 MSmits: and just calculate them as part of the simple-game solver after all the complex objects are gone
 MSmits: because you can safely play them all at the end
 MSmits: this includes chains and loops that came out of complex objects
 MSmits: so they are created and then postponed
 MSmits: this is because they are always a netgain for the controlling player, so he will never give up control when they are offered
 MSmits: so by the time the defender is offering these objects, he's offering them all, one after another, until the game ends
 Marchete: why those numbers?
 Marchete: like loops of size &gt; 8?
 Marchete: &gt;=8?
 MSmits: because, if you offer a loop of 8
 MSmits: and the opponent wants to keep control
 MSmits: he needs to give up 4 boxes
 MSmits: so that's 4-4
 MSmits: netgain 0
 MSmits: with a chain of 4,he needs to give up 2 boxes to keep control (a double dealing move)
 MSmits: 2-2 also netgain 0
 MSmits: 3-chains and 4/6 loops are different because when the defender offers them, the controlling player has a net loss to keep control
 Marchete: Good bless dbdr_'s chat save :D
 Marchete: I'll recover that later
 MSmits: what I did was disallow all offerings for these larger chains and loops until the complex objects are gone, got all the same negamax results on 1000 tested games
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 MSmits: and a 2-3 x speedup
 Marchete: sh*t I got caught!
 MSmits: hey dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: hey!
 MSmits: there's some complex stuff going on with short strings in complex objects. If I figure that out I think a 10x speedup or more is possible
 MSmits: because the worst endgames consist of a ton of splits with little 1 or 2 size strings on them
 MSmits: which make sense, the more splits, the more complexity and the smaller the strings, the more splits fit in 7x7
 MSmits: but 1-2 length strings switch control, always, so if you have good heuristics for when this must happen, you lose the branching 
 Astrobytes: When can we expect the paper on D&amp;B then?
 MSmits: Well... this is actually the first time I think I could publish something worthwhile
 MSmits: but I am not done with it
 MSmits: i mean scientifically worthwhile
 Astrobytes: Yeah I knew what you meant&#160;:)
 MSmits: Though, if uttt had more attention in the scientific community, I suppose I could publish some about that 
 MSmits: and maybe yavalath
 MSmits: but D&amp;B seems more popular
 Astrobytes: Do it anyway, niche market
 MSmits: how does that work anyway?
 Astrobytes: what?
 MSmits: if you want to get something published into a journal when you're not affiliated with a university?
 wlesavo: you can add any affiliation you want, nobody checks that
 Astrobytes: Not sure tbh, most people end up approaching someone from an institution
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: I would love to meet some of these guys. Half the papers I read are from my own country
 wlesavo: you even can add your cat as coathor as story tells
 MSmits: won't work
 MSmits: no cat
 MSmits: :dog:
 wlesavo: lol
 Hjax: then astro and i can be coauthors :D 
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo: uljahn as a cat
 MSmits: why Uljahn?
 wlesavo: he is a cat
 MSmits: oh, didn't know
 Hjax: his profile picture is Sakamoto from an anime called Nichijou
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8abe159b-b914-4a09-b47d-d82281cf18b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8abe159b-b914-4a09-b47d-d82281cf18b1</a>
 MSmits: is this one of those things where you have infinite universes, one of them has a cat posing as a CG player succesfully by randomly hitting the keyboard?
 Uljahn: Hjax: that's right
 Marchete: damn, it's not clear
 Astrobytes: I would guess approaching some journals in the field would work MSmits, foir self-publishing I mean
 MSmits: Marchete very clear 
 jacek: how does publishing to arxiv work
 Marchete: I mean
 MSmits: i see a bunch of B's 
 wlesavo: MSmits actually almost any paper have email, if you will write to them im very sure they will answer you and even will agree to meet with you
 MSmits: Astrobytes sure, will keep that in mind
 jacek: it seems many things there are some drafts rather htan papers
 Marchete: yeah, it's about different gamestates
 MSmits: what are the B's&#160;?
 Marchete: but I think they should have the same Hash
 Astrobytes: Good points wlesavo
 Marchete: boxes
 MSmits: oh you mean because for an independent chain, it doesnt matter where it is?
 Marchete: it's a chain with 2 3-way boxes
 Marchete: because if you cut a chain
 Marchete: it doesn't matter how's painted
 MSmits: right, if it is an independent one
 MSmits: if it's a string, connected to a bunch of other stuff, then it does matter
 Marchete: but if in both cases I end with an equivalent state
 Marchete: the id of the edges are irrelevant
 MSmits: yeah, there's tons of opportunity for reduction by graph equivalency. It's just very hard to make use of it
 Marchete: hmm
 Marchete: a simpler example
 Marchete: you have 2 loops of size 4
 Marchete: it's irrelevant what you open of those two
 Marchete: it's the same gamestate
 Marchete: no matter the edge or the loop itself
 MSmits: yeah, for my hash I just have a "loop4Count"
 Marchete: you achieved that?
 MSmits: the funny thing is, I can fit all information about an endgame in a single uint64_t
 Marchete: creating a hash that can make that?
 Marchete: in a single uint64_t?
 MSmits: well.. only if it's an endgame by my definition
 MSmits: yes
 Marchete: impossible
 MSmits: you'd think so
 MSmits: however, the connections are fixed when the endgame starts
 MSmits: the choosing of which object you open matters though
 MSmits: so whats different between states can all be encoded within the 7x7 bits
 Marchete: and I disagree
 Marchete: if you reduce the game to for example 2 equal loops
 Marchete: it's irrelevant the edge to open
 Marchete: or even N equal loops
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: thats right
 Marchete: so, you achieved something similar?
 Marchete: I think it's pretty hard
 MSmits: well it's hard to explain. What i do only works for endgames
 MSmits: the symmetry i make use of is only for:
 Marchete: ah, ok
 MSmits: independent 1 and 2 chains
 MSmits: doesnt matter where they are
 MSmits: also 3 chains
 MSmits: 4 loops
 Marchete: no matter the length?
 MSmits: and recently everything thats a long chain or a 8 &gt;= loop
 MSmits: no i count them
 MSmits: you see
 MSmits: 49 bits taken
 MSmits: 3 bits for all possible 1 chain
 MSmits: 4 bits for all possible 2 chain counts
 MSmits: i mean counts
 MSmits: it doesnt matter where they are, only how many
 Marchete: yeah, that's my whole idea about hashing the states
 MSmits: so i count them and put them in the 15 bit i have left
 Marchete: graph-wise, not edge/box wise
 MSmits: i use the 49 bit only for complex objects
 Marchete: ok
 MSmits: the only thing that matters is where they have been taken or not
 MSmits: which is why you can put 1 box in 1 bit
 MSmits: since the connections are fixed before the endgame starts
 MSmits: where = whether
 MSmits: and i use unscored states
 Marchete: imo chains are different when you talk about outer edges
 Marchete: ground for me
 MSmits: i call them grounded chains yes
 Marchete: ok
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: no i just call them chains
 MSmits: all my chains are grounded
 Marchete: well
 MSmits: if they are stuck to a split, they are strings
 Marchete: except loops
 MSmits: one sided grounded maybe, and one side attached to a split, thats a  string
 MSmits: or both sides attached to a split
 Marchete: so O-O is not a chain?
 MSmits: if it is isolated, it is
 MSmits: but they are all stuck to the edge
 MSmits: because they have to
 Marchete: O-O-O-O is not a grounded chain
 MSmits: it can be
 MSmits: it can be  in the corner
 MSmits: one side on the left edge of the board, the other side on the top edge
 Marchete: â–’-O-O-O-â–’ is grounded for me
 MSmits: you mean both sides have a connection to the edge of the board right?
 Marchete: or anything with â–’
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: in my defintion those are chains
 Marchete: or even only one
 MSmits: and nothing else is called a chain
 Marchete: â–’-O-O-O 
 MSmits: if it's only 1, it's not a chain
 Marchete: that's not a chain?
 MSmits: it's a string
 MSmits: because one side is on a split
 MSmits: so it's part of a complex object
 Marchete: hmm, now I understand your naming
 MSmits: simple endgames only have chains and loops
 Marchete: I only have chains :D
 MSmits: how do you only have chains?
 Marchete: why not?
 MSmits: you mean by your definition?
 Marchete: chain == graph
 Marchete: grounded chain with minDegree 1 and MaxDegree 2: â–’-O-O-O 
 Marchete: grounded chain with minDegree 2 and MaxDegree 2: â–’-O-O-O-â–’
 Marchete: ungrounded chain with minDegree 2 and MaxDegree 2: a Loop
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: and so on :D
 MSmits: totally different from the papers I use
 MSmits: they use my definitions
 Marchete: I imagine
 MSmits: some other papers use different ones though, but they are crappy anyway
 MSmits: one used "circles" for loops
 Marchete: thanks
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: i dont mean the one you use
 MSmits: the one i paid for
 Marchete: you implicity said it, no problem
 MSmits: it was crap and used circles and other weird names
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: but anyway, we use this representation for completely different purposes
 Marchete: no, but I was trying to go from edges/boxes to a higher level
 Marchete: of graph representation
 Marchete: and then hashing that graph
 MSmits: yeah, thats much easier to do in the end game
 MSmits: i dont even know where to begin when everything is so many times connected
 MSmits: in my case I can just assume that when a box is played it is immediately taken and out of the game
 MSmits: so i never have to worry about which edge was played
 MSmits: you can only play 2-way boxes in an endgame, so as soon as you play one, the opponent takes it
 Marchete: I'm in that point, at what time one need to worry about chains
 MSmits: no idea really
 sugam: anyone from nepal?
 Marchete: and the game is impossible to score before that point
 MSmits: the problem with papers about this is a lot of "rule of thumb" no hard rules
 Marchete: I mean, how? I have literally no idea
 MSmits: humans can guess and half-gamble
 MSmits: AI needs probabilities
 MSmits: stuff needs to be quantified
 MSmits: thats what makes it hard to use those rules
 MSmits: NN might be good for this part of the game actually
 MSmits: even though the one paper i found that tried it, failed
 MSmits: but was a student I think, so what did he know
 Marchete: yeah, I think I saw it too
 Marchete: they are all of the same university
 MSmits: probably a professor that likes the game
 Marchete: like they just try to do more work about some existing stuff
 MSmits: Combinatorial Game Theory: The Dots-and-Boxes Game
 MSmits: this one is not bad
 MSmits: I took most from here though: PLAYING SIMPLE LOONY DOTS AND BOXES ENDGAMES OPTIMALLY.
 MSmits: at first the theorems and corollaries make your head hurt, but you can mostly ignore all the proofs and then you're left with very specific instructions
 MSmits: for simple endgames that is
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: and then you try to use some of those rules for complex endgames, some stick, some stick in specific situations etc.
 Marchete: I think I have them all, like pokemons
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: the stuff by elwyn berlekamp I havent found useful
 MSmits: this seems all catered toward human play
 MSmits: he's supposedly D&amp;B guru, but not for AI I think
 MSmits: maybe i'll find more use in it when i finish the endgame stuff and i am in your situation
 Marchete: well I'm using the coding as "strings and coins" game, they created that
 Marchete: the graph*
 MSmits: ahh yeah
 MSmits: it's equivalent
 Marchete: gotta go, we'll talk tomorrow probably :D
 MSmits: for the endgame you need a different structure though, why keep a string of 8 coins with 7 connections between them
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: wlel
 MSmits: I am painting my house
 MSmits: so maybe :P
 jacek: painting with dots and boxes?
 vortexdom: how can i put circularField in pod?
 Crypticsy: you're talking about "SHIELD"?
 MSmits: just paint jacek, just paint. However, if some strange patterns emerge on the walls and my wife notices, I will claim innocence
 Hjax: MSmits have you experienced the tetris effect from codingame yet 
 darkhorse64: If you paint randomly dots, you will cover the entire wall in the end. This is Monte Carlo Paint
 Astrobytes: If you paint in branches rather than dots, it is Monte Carlo Tree Painting
 Hjax: honey why didnt you paint that part of the wall? uh..... im not confident enough, maybe if i paint the rest of the wall some more first....
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/df/b6/8e/dfb68eb13c199a3753a67866b972346f--straight-lines-knights.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/236x/df/b6/8e/dfb68eb13c199a3753a67866b972346f--straight-lines-knights.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: UCT for arborists: they relax more the higher in the tree they climb
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 sugam: where did i heard monte carlo before...
 sugam: oh yes the assignment from princeton's algorithms course
 jacek: this is also a place in monaco
 jacek: where they plant trees
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: hjax, tetris effect?
 Hjax: when you play a game too much and start seeing it everywhere or dreaming about it 
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: I think it's the other way around
 MSmits: sometimes other things affect my codingame time 
 Hjax: ah, i would have expected you to see UTTT in the clouds by now :P
 MSmits: I have had CG affect dreams a few times
 MSmits: but most of it was during contests
 MSmits: and not lately
 MSmits: first few contest I was a bit more dedicated
 MSmits: since i discovered boardgames they are less interesting to me so i am a little more sane about them
 MSmits: during some contests I actually woke up randomly in the night, ran to my PC to code up some stuff before I forgot it
 MSmits: not kidding
 Hjax: ive definitely woke up with a fully formed coding idea in my head before 
 Hjax: usually the solution to a bug
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: mostly this happens when I go for a walk, but I think going for a long walk and dreaming are similar states of mind in this regard
 Hjax: once i knew the exact line of code that was wrong and why, its was almost surreal 
 MSmits: you are processing
 MSmits: yeah it seems surreal
 MSmits: I suggest going for walks between coding complicated stuff
 Hjax: oh i love walks, i think more clearly when im moving 
 jacek: try lucid dreaming and using computers in dream. thats surreal
 sugam: can we see when the user joined this website?
 MSmits: you can check their profile
 MSmits: with the codingpoints history
 MSmits: thats roughly when they started I guess
 MSmits: coding rank i mean
 sugam: where do i check the coding points history
 Astrobytes: The graph on the profile
 jacek: graph eh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, click on the 'Ranking'
 MSmits: you dont see it for your own profile sugam
 MSmits: it's too new or because it has no cp, not sure
 MSmits: try one of ours
 DomiKo: no CP
 MSmits: makes sense
 sugam: ok wait..
 Hjax: so on my profile sugam, see where it says im ranked 335th? click on that
 MSmits: you need to hover over the dots in the graph
 MSmits: 21 march 2018 for Hjax
 Hjax:&#160;?
 MSmits: same day for me apparently, :confused: 
 sugam: oh yes 
 sugam: i saw
 Hjax: my account is much older than that 
 MSmits: yeah something is off here
 Hjax: my graph goes back to oct 22 2014 for me 
 sugam: 37k ranking
 Astrobytes: Yep, that's what I get
 sugam: started from 8th sept
 MSmits: oh right
 sugam: how good is this?
 MSmits: yeah i did something wrong Hjax
 Hjax: and then you can see the massive period of inactivity until last year when i actually started playing
 MSmits: sugam overall ranking is not very reliably as a judge of skill
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I have the same, 2015 though
 sugam: what do i check?
 MSmits: if the ranking is very high, you can, at most say, someone is "pretty good"
 MSmits: but the top players can't be distinguished by rank
 MSmits: sugam contests are a reasonable estimate, but not perfect, so you could use contest rank
 MSmits: contests require players to have plenty of time to participate though
 MSmits: in a short timespan
 MSmits: not everyone can do that
 sugam: hmm... i see
 Hjax: theres quite a few players who are serious contenders to win any contest they play in that arent in the top 100
 DomiKo: first 100K points
 DomiKo: are just grinding
 Hjax: karliso and teccles come to mind 
 MSmits: yeah they are good
 MSmits: re curse also
 Hjax: hes rank 21 though
 MSmits: he is also ranked high, but he's better than most that are ranked above him
 sugam: I'mma go practice i think
 MSmits: even though those guys are all good
 MSmits: re curse is pretty awesome as a competitor
 DomiKo: i have to say
 Hjax: he might be the best if hes taking a contest seriously, his track record is pretty insane
 DomiKo: when i joined the site
 DomiKo: i thought that re curse is a god
 Hjax: well, you arent wrong 
 DomiKo: just by looking at his performance on contest
 Hjax: hes won many things
 MSmits: he's awesome, but not alone in that, there are a few others, but not many at all
 MSmits: i am very impressed by karliso personally
 MSmits: because he seems to have very little knowledge and uses it to great results
 Hjax: yeah, i learned about him the hard way in utg
 Hjax: last minute rank 1
 Hjax: outdid teccles who was crushing everyone at the end 
 MSmits: he's always asking about algorithms on chat that every one knows and then he uses them to get nr 1
 MSmits: teccles is good too, i think he has the best uttt minimax
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: if he do something he seriously do it
 Hjax: theres also the_duck, who im afraid of because of previous coding contests outside of codingame
 MSmits: his uttt bot has 3x more lines than mine :P
 MSmits: karliso's i mean
 Hjax: he did quite well in utg and then vanished
 MSmits: yeah he just does contests
 MSmits: like the guy that won locam
 MSmits: forgot the name
 Hjax: the_duck won battlecode 3 years in a row, only person to do that 
 MSmits: wow nice
 sugam: Maybe the real treasure is the friends we make along the way
 MSmits: sugam this is a great place to find likeminded people and discuss stuff so I guess you're right
 MSmits: it's also a quote from somewhere :P
 Hjax: cg honestly has a great community, mostly due to the 10 or so super active skilled people that frequent this chat 
 Astrobytes: CG has a good community around it for sure
 sugam: i can see that
 DomiKo: yes
 Hjax: (like smits, astro, and euler) 
 sugam: it's my second day and I'm hooked
 DomiKo: community is really the best thing there
 sugam: not as a hooker
 DomiKo: if you just ask here, you can do some much in a really short time
 Astrobytes: Very true
 Astrobytes: *ask the right questions
 DomiKo: I can say it from my experience :sweat_smile:
 DomiKo: and read forum
 DomiKo: there is a lot of knowledge
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 Hjax: the postmortems are great
 Hjax: (and fun to write after a stressful contest)
 im.aryan7: here anyone who is in school?
 im.aryan7: class 10
 markyy: the duck reached level 12
 MSmits: class 10 is a bit meaningless internationally. Different countries organize schools differently
 MSmits: I usually try to say the age + cognitive level
 im.aryan7: i am 16
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: almost 40 here
 im.aryan7: whats cognitive lvl
 im.aryan7: ohh
 MSmits: how smart they are
 im.aryan7: okh
 im.aryan7: i started using this website 2 days ago
 DomiKo: you can find people with various age
 DomiKo: 21 here
 im.aryan7: so i am a newbie
 MSmits: if you're here on codingame your class is probably high cognitive level
 AntiSquid: i am 30 + 2i years old
 MSmits: why are you adding complex numbers to your age?
 im.aryan7: whats the average age of people?
 MSmits: people in general?
 im.aryan7: yeah
 Astrobytes: I'm 38
 Astrobytes: I think
 Hjax: im 24, i think the average age on this site is older than i am 
 Dragon0l: 18
 TrippTrapp84: My age is 3rd dimensional, nerd. I'm a solid 12 +2i - 5k
 im.aryan7: i am 16 
 MSmits: Hjax of the active people it is, but maybe not the lurkers
 DomiKo: Hjax active people are older*
 Hjax: at least the average age of chatters is older than me :D 
 MSmits: yeah
 im.aryan7: just completed that thor episide 1
 MSmits: good
 im.aryan7: so what do you guys do here? you all might be in jab aleady
 im.aryan7: job*
 DomiKo: nahhh
 DomiKo: I don't work
 DomiKo: work is not fun
 Q12: It is for fun
 im.aryan7: yeah!
 im.aryan7: anyone who completed thor episode 1?
 Hjax: im a software engineer
 Q12: Yes me im.aryan7
 im.aryan7: whats your age?
 Q12: I don't want to share my age in public
 im.aryan7: ok no problem
 Q12: :thumbsup:
 Hjax: with a small amount of googling you can find my real name and age on the internet, so it personally doesnt bother me to talk about myself
 Q12: But I am pretty young...
 im.aryan7: what is your size code Q12
 im.aryan7: when you coded thor
 Q12: Wait a sec I checking
 im.aryan7: i am also young
 im.aryan7: i might me younger than you!
 Astrobytes: The age range on here is between 12/13 and 50s/early 60s
 Astrobytes: afaik
 im.aryan7: 12/13 years old!?
 Q12: All my lines together are 107 but I start this puzzle in my first month here and didn't touch him since
 Hjax: im trying to think who the oldest user ive talked to on this site is 
 Astrobytes: Yes im.aryan7, jrke for instance is 13 (and pretty good)
 Hjax: PatrickMcGinnisII i think is in his 50s? 
 im.aryan7: i started coding at that age
 im.aryan7: and came to know about this 2 days ago
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think so Hjax
 Hjax: yeah i first learned how to program when i was about 13 as well, but i was realllllllllllllllllllly bad
 Hjax: i played aichallenge ants and planet wars 
 AntiSquid: hey my teachers were first pretending to teach me how to code when i was 12 also
 AntiSquid: was playing games in class back then
 im.aryan7: :joy:
 Q12: I stumbled this website after a long time of searching good place to practice code. I don't know how it is know but I think if you will publish the website more he will have a lot more users.
 Q12: *now
 im.aryan7: yeah!
 im.aryan7: how to you mention someone on this chat?
 im.aryan7: do*
 Hjax: you just say their name
 Astrobytes: Just type their username
 im.aryan7: ok Hjax
 Hjax: yeah, that message was red for me im.aryan7
 im.aryan7: ok Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: yes im.aryan7
 Hjax: :thumbsup:
 im.aryan7: ohh i could not see it red
 Hjax: yeah its only red when someone mentions you
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: you must say it 3 times to successfully summon
 Astrobytes: lmao
 im.aryan7: okay
 Astrobytes: (he's joking)
 AntiSquid: ofc i am
 Hjax: Automaton2000 Automaton2000 Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you have a list of possible moves
 Hjax: see magic
 AntiSquid: i have pings turned off, i'll never answer just because you ping me
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Hjax: :D
 im.aryan7: i know he was Astrobytes :wink:
 sugam: ah i hate this. I'm doing clash of code and they give a very tough question to solve in the shortest character and then I can't even solve and can't even understand the code of the competitors 
 sugam: i hate my life
 Hjax: clash isnt the best way to practice
 Hjax: better to do something you can take your time on 
 sugam: I'm super demotivated 
 Hjax: whys that 
 sugam: everybody are smart except me
 Gloryness: im not smart
 Hjax: experienced* 
 Hjax: which is something you can overcome with practice
 sugam: should i do the puzzles 
 Astrobytes: Do the easy puzzles, don't clash for now
 sugam: or the bot?
 Astrobytes: Both if you like
 Hjax: start with puzzles until you get comfortable id say 
 Hjax: then try a multi that looks fun / easy 
 sugam: okay. I think I'll pull an all nighter today
 Hjax: arent you playing the unofficial contest? being sleep deprived wont help you 
 Astrobytes: Hey, sleep is great you know
 Hjax: it starts only 2 days from now
 sugam: yes I am playing that
 sugam: I should prepare for that init?
 Hjax: being well rested is important too 
 Astrobytes: ^
 sugam: it's 11;20. I'll try to solve puzzle for 40 mins
 The_Auditor: anybody did the weekly chalange&#160;?
 Q12: Yes
 The_Auditor: my solution passes all tests except Validator 1
 im.aryan7: where is weekly challenge
 im.aryan7:&#160;?
 The_Auditor: can't find what the problem is...
 im.aryan7: i am new here
 Q12: Maybe your program run for more time then needed
 im.aryan7: for 2 days
 Q12: Click the bell in up right of the screen and there should be message that her title is puzzle of the week, just click it

 im.aryan7: thanks Q12
 Q12: you welcome :relaxed:
 im.aryan7: you too The_Auditor
 im.aryan7: :blush:

 kpackapgo: How do you know for example that E middle line is "##  " and not the same as upper and bot lines "### "
 aqbed2je1: awesome
 kpackapgo: ok got it :D
 jacek: :tada:
 Q12: I am trying to put spaces between numbers in the statement of contribution to make them look like there are in grid but when I click send It's like erasing all the spaces I put. Can somebody help me?
 Q12: and it's leave just one space between each number
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04374">https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04374</a>
 Hjax: thats a strange use for alphazero lol
 MSmits: instead if playing the game better it makes the game better?
 MSmits: of
 jacek: maybe it will invent yavalath 2.0
 jacek: without the need of pie rule
 MSmits: impossible
 MSmits: the game is already perfected
 SituatedDust: anyone feeling bored wanting to help me debug my code for code of the rings?

 DJSunnyOctopus_6c0c: hi

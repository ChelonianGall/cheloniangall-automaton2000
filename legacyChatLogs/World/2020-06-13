 WINWINWIN: Last 5 min of contest
 WINWINWIN: At least I can stay in the top 100&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: contest over, well done everyone
 jacek: happy Caturday
 WINWINWIN: Happy Caturday jacek
 WINWINWIN: Sorry for that previous message on the contest being over :joy: I misread the date on the website... 
 WINWINWIN: It ends tomorrow
 jacek: phew
 WINWINWIN: :D
 cegprakash: hi all
 cegprakash: did the PR contest end?
 cegprakash: okay I see it's not ended yet
 cegprakash: I don't want to read the problem statement can someone tell it in short
 cegprakash: should I try PR1 in order to understand PR2?
 eulerscheZahl: no, these are 2 different games
 cegprakash: i give up.. 
 cegprakash: tool long to read
 cegprakash: I go to paper soccer
 Astrobytes: lol, you're some guy ceg
 Astrobytes: :D
 cegprakash: u missed "awe" before "some"
 Astrobytes: lol

 struct: I added these
 struct: For legal moves
 struct: So people dont need to read
 struct: I might disable it though
 cegprakash: ^ that's not PR2
 eulerscheZahl: you mean disable by default and hide behind a togglle?
 struct: yeah
 struct: Ok, I switched some stuff, now I don't think it looks so bad
 jacek: mhm
 struct: not submited yet

 struct: 46000 moves???
 struct: on connect 6
 jacek: well you have 2 moves per turn
 struct: ah
 Astrobytes: So LoA or Amazons next?
 eulerscheZahl: is that a google question?
 Astrobytes: Close, it's a struct question
 struct: I don't know yet
 struct: I enjoyed both
 Astrobytes: Yeah, both great games
 struct: I never played any though
 struct: I don't really played any of the games I ported
 Astrobytes: You can play them online to get a feel for the rules
 struct: I would port the river one to change the type a bit
 struct: But I don't really like random games
 Astrobytes: Try it with both players receiving the same tile
 Astrobytes: or the same choice of n tiles
 struct: euler do you know where I  can find more documentation about SDK?
 struct: Version 3.15.0 seems to be released, but can't find any info about it
 struct: oh even 3.15.2
 eulerscheZahl: it's not in the release notes. so: commit messages<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/commits/master">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/commits/master</a>

 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I think I'm gonna do gota
 JBM: how d'you get the pix on the CG CDN?
 struct: what do you mean JBM?
 JBM: your pictures
 JBM: how did you get them linked from CG?
 struct: to the replay?
 JBM: from the html
 struct: ah in the statement?
 JBM: yes, thath
 struct: ok
 struct: I submit the pictures on asset folder
 struct: then I do this, let me screen shot
 JBM: i don't think i've got an immediate need for this
 JBM: but i haven't seen this really documented anywhere, i'mcurious
 struct: This is because its not straight forward
 struct: Its like fixing stuff with hammer
 struct: When you submit a new image on assets folder
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/k0tmsal.png">https://i.imgur.com/k0tmsal.png</a>
 struct: It will create a link
 struct: If you dont change the image or delete it, the link wont change
 struct: So I just update the statement after, with the link from the previous submit
 JBM: so you just name them normally and the sdk translates accordingly?
 JBM: gtg, i'll read you later
 struct: Yeah, I can put any name, I just  need to submit one time to get the links to update the statement
 Astrobytes: struct - Othello seems finished, are you planning any more changes?
 struct: I think it's fine like this
 Astrobytes: Everything seems to be OK, legal moves, valid move input all matches up with viewer and map input
 Astrobytes: Seems to be ready for approval imo
 struct: Should be
 struct: But I think the game gets more visibility on Contribution page
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: lol&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: All default code in all langs works, or doesn't crash at least, I'll give it an approve
 struct: Thanks
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: entries on contribute page: 28entries in multiplayer section: 45
 eulerscheZahl: keep it pending :P
 struct: Also dont forget that you get red notification on contribution page
 struct: when a multi gets aproved you dont get any notification do you?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: make it private and WIP again. at least once per day
 struct: lol
 yassineH: guys how can  i find all the puzzle someone contributed...???
 yassineH: i only have the name of the user...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=</a>CTRL+F, enter username
 eulerscheZahl: loading the page may take a second or 2, lots of content
 yassineH: ok thx
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/LdmQT4t.png">https://i.imgur.com/LdmQT4t.png</a>
 struct:&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: seems i indexed it before you deleted
 eulerscheZahl: i still have the bitrunner bosses in my DB (but don't output that part)
 yassineH: hello again @eulerscheZahl , the solutions you provided was exact but i could not find one of his contributions.. it is a ClashOfCode i just played few mins ago.. anyways, is it possible that some of the contributions dont appear in that list??
 yassineH: *solution
 yassineH: if so, then how can i find it...
 yassineH: i still have the text of the challenge.. and of course the name of the user..
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it's very now and i have to index again...
 WINWINWIN: someone approve othello, I want to try it in the arena
 eulerscheZahl: 9 puzzles added. try again yassineH
 struct: You can work on it in demo
 struct: Its just less games played
 yassineH: @eulerscheZahl thx alot, i just find it..
 eulerscheZahl: note: you can also add a text to filter and search for
 eulerscheZahl: that is: a part of the statement or testcases
 struct: euler do you think it matter if notation starts from 1 to 10 bottom
 struct: instead of 10 to 1
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: as long as it's clear how the notation works it's fine i think
 struct: Yeah, I think the same
 eulerscheZahl: we have some inconsistency in other games too. e.g. UTTT uses y,x while most others have x,y
 eulerscheZahl: much more annoying for me :P
 yassineH: @eulerscheZahl btw is this a personal project? i mean that link you shared with me...
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: there is no official puzzle search
 yassineH: that is cool..
 yassineH: how do you actualy get the data?
 eulerscheZahl: there is an overview page with all approved puzzles. you need level 29 to see them
 yassineH: oh, ok..
 eulerscheZahl: and opening the page on CG kills the tab because the list is too long :D
 struct: :D
 yassineH: i see
 yassineH: btw i think you search input does not include the sub-title of the items (mean the user name of the contributer "puzzle_type by user_name")
 yassineH: *your
 yassineH: *meaning
 eulerscheZahl: correct: i don't check the username
 eulerscheZahl: only statement, testcases, comments made by other users
 eulerscheZahl: and the title of course
 yassineH: ok thank you again for sharing, and have a nice day
 eulerscheZahl: you too&#160;:)
 struct: euler I need your feedback again, sorry to bother you
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/V6lM140.png">https://i.imgur.com/V6lM140.png</a>
 struct: Imagine this scenario, white only has 8 moves left
 struct: black has 31
 struct: Neither of white moves can impact black moves
 struct: Should I end game earlier?
 struct: Oh this might be a bit hard to do 
 struct: if piece at d1 doesnt make white stuck
 struct: it still has 1 move
 eulerscheZahl: guidelines: end game early if it won't change the winner
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know the rules of the game to answer that
 Astrobytes: It's last man standing struct
 struct: yeah astro, but if player cant win anymore
 struct: should it continue?
 eulerscheZahl: guidelines say: nobut if it's not directly obvious, maybe you should still keep going
 eulerscheZahl: lots of complaining users
 eulerscheZahl: cegs
 struct: He complained about Othello statement right?
 struct: I wasnt here at the time, so I dont know
 Astrobytes: Implement it as it should be at first, and lets test it 
 struct: You are right
 struct: Ill see how it goes
 Astrobytes: Don't forget that people can block their amazons in error
 Astrobytes: So losing when they should have won
 struct: Yeah, that can happen
 struct: But it shouldnt with good bots
 Astrobytes: ofc
 eulerscheZahl: if it can happen, play till the end
 Astrobytes: And even though it's like a two-phase action, I think just keeping it as MOVE_SQUARE SHOOT_SQUARE is fine
 Astrobytes: Well, obviously with starting square or unit ID first
 struct: will be like a4 a6 a8
 Astrobytes: yeah
 struct: unitpos moveto arrowpos
 Astrobytes: exactly
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 Astrobytes: Hm, a rejection because someone doesn't like it? How about just not playing it?
 struct: ...
 struct: I saw
 struct: I mentioned it in fr
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw
 struct: Its just not about being 1 more MCTS game
 struct: at least from what I read in fr chat
 Astrobytes: Wow
 Astrobytes: That's just... not why you reject a contribution
 eulerscheZahl: i dislike the troll vs castle game (too random). not a fan of search race either (CSB clone).but that's a personal opinion, not sure if it would justify a refuse.you are not forced to play every game
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 eulerscheZahl: but :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: And as for 0 originality - it's a straight port of a board game...
 eulerscheZahl: keep going with more of those games
 struct: Also why should we even spend a lot of time on contributions
 struct: CG doesnt reward it
 struct: Even if I create an original game
 struct: it doesnt get promoted
 eulerscheZahl: we should stick to what CG gives us and not use our own opinion for moderations: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Contributions must be original. (for all games but Clash of Code)
 eulerscheZahl: but questionable, IMO unique enough
 struct: Well how many puzzles use same algorithm?
 Snef: original = not close to an existing multi or not copy pasted from a real game&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: other CG game
 eulerscheZahl: adding additional value to the platform
 Snef: well it is (for me) original then
 Astrobytes: Do they think we can't read French or something btw?
 struct: If the game was checkers on 10 x 10 I could understand
 Snef: othello is one of the easiest board game to play
 struct: Well w/e people are entilted to their opinion, I just don't think that was good enough reason to refuse it
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of the wikipedia community (which differs depending on languages)
 eulerscheZahl: some are like "if 1 or 2 users read that article and it helps them, let's approve this article"
 eulerscheZahl: German community: this topic isn't relevant enough, delete
 eulerscheZahl: same here: not sure if i will ever play Othello. But i know a few users who will have fun with it
 Astrobytes: Not good enough eulerscheZahl, you must say one thing and chat then reject the contribution and fail to mention that fact
 Astrobytes: *in chat
 struct: If I hate a game i just ignore it
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: my bad. can we have a contribution that gets refused, then reuploaded and approved?
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i know some users who hate it when that happens :D
 struct: Nothing prevents it
 eulerscheZahl: rhetorical question
 struct: ah I answered too afst :p
 struct: fast*
 Astrobytes: euler's in thinking-ahead troll mode :P
 eulerscheZahl: happened a few times in the past, they got really mad
 Astrobytes: lol, some people are seriously way too sensitive
 eulerscheZahl: understandably if it was a bogus clash approved by some users with green rank
 Astrobytes: Yes of course, but otherwise if it was a perfectly valid contribution...
 eulerscheZahl: actually I respect them: they raise overall quality. giving justified feedback, editing puzzles even after approval (stub generator, statement, ..)
 struct: If I add fog of war, will my contribution be original?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: Oh I agree there euler, in fact a few have stopped even doing so because of CGs rules
 Astrobytes: (wrt clashes at least)
 struct: Clash is completely differnt from 2 years ago
 struct: So many math problems
 struct: Its ridicolous
 bao555: hi
 Astrobytes: I guess it appeals to a certain demographic
 yassineH: hello again @eulerscheZahl , here is a "i dont know what i am doing with my time" kind of contribution to the following link you share&#160;: 
 yassineH: eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/
 yassineH: contribution&#160;:
 yassineH: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5955f9f6-12b0-46e9-9798-fc5fb8b527be">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5955f9f6-12b0-46e9-9798-fc5fb8b527be</a>
 yassineH: #just run this in the console...
 yassineH: #sorry_for_wasting_your_time hhh
 eulerscheZahl: that style is quite blue
 bao555: hello world
 yassineH: yap
 yassineH: i am a big fan of blue
 eulerscheZahl: i might do some visual cleanup one day. definitely needed
 eulerscheZahl: but not that blue&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: The style is nice if not the colour scheme :D
 yassineH: @eulerscheZahl hhhh, i would love to help if you would let me..
 struct: are RAIC games original enough?
 eulerscheZahl: define a stylesheet that is less agressive and i'll add it
 Astrobytes: lol
 yassineH: @Astrobytes thx/2
 struct: Sorry I got a bit salty
 yassineH: @eulerscheZahl challenge accepted
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 eulerscheZahl: send me a private message in case i'm offline when you are done
 Astrobytes: No I understand totally struct
 eulerscheZahl: don't let that 1 reaction ruin your day struct
 eulerscheZahl: we are still cheering for you
 Astrobytes: And you have completely silenced fr by speaking English
 Snef: struct create another contrib that is othello with dynamic board size in reponse
 struct: Thanks, I'm well aware that my games are not original
 struct: Snef I dont even need to do tha I just need to change 2 values
 Astrobytes: Physics-based, no board, in space
 struct: and it should work
 Snef: yea but you need to do another contrib
 eulerscheZahl: like coders of the realm :imp:
 yassineH: @eulerscheZahl sure will
 eulerscheZahl: :thumbsup:
 struct: But Snef it will still be dominated by MCTS
 Snef: struct i know it was waying that just to annoy those who refused othello&#160;;)
 Snef: -w +s
 Snef: -t
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: #fr is often dead those days&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Really? It used to be busy always!
 Stilgart: it is during contests
 Stilgart: but otherwise, it can be pretty empty
 Astrobytes: Ah, I guess it's kinda the same for World. It's been a little busier recently though.
 eulerscheZahl: #de is dead
 eulerscheZahl: :cactus:
 eulerscheZahl: :desert:
 struct: To me feels like CG is&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: we need a contest. a real one, not that PR2 fake contest
 Astrobytes: Nah, not dead. There are enough regular users who like to hack away at things. But definitely more so than it used to be.
 struct: Yeah, contest are what keep site alive imo
 Astrobytes: I think if thibpat can coordinate a proper contest with an original contribution it would be a success
 eulerscheZahl: or if we can convince Thibaud when we have a game
 Astrobytes: Yes, that also
 eulerscheZahl: that is: not spoiled and more original than othello :P
 eulerscheZahl: sorry struct
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I wouldn't  mind, but I don't really have ideas
 eulerscheZahl: join me?
 struct: Sure euler
 eulerscheZahl: private then
 Astrobytes: Woop woop!
 Stilgart: struct: as I said earlier on #fr, I would rather have you working with others on original ideas
 Stilgart: your engines are nice, so are your statements
 Astrobytes: Yes, although I'm a fan of the board games it would indeed be nice to see him work on something original.
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: re bitboards<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf">https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf</a>
 Astrobytes: Not sure if it's this one you're looking for but it's useful
 Stilgart: it was the one (dwarfie and I had a different link for it though)
 Stilgart: struct: I was thinking that, for yout othello, maybe you can sell the bitboard part, which is more original than the mcts part
 struct: Sorry, was talking with euler
 Astrobytes: Ah ok. It's a very useful paper.
 struct: Yeah I agree that working with others might make it easier to create an original game
 Stilgart: yep, might be worth to give this link in the statement
 struct: I  remember this link from Yavalath :D
 Stilgart: (I never opened this one... too many puzzles these days)
 darkhorse64: This paper is mostly irrelevant for Yavalath
 Stilgart: but it is relevant for othello
 struct: But I remember it being mentioned around that time
 darkhorse64: Sure
 Astrobytes: I also agree that a Bitboard(ing) tag should be added struct 
 struct: There is bitboarding tag
 struct: Should I use that one?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 struct: Only 1 puzzle uses it, and its not really a puzzle
 struct: its a tech io thing
 Stilgart: then, you have your source of motivation for othello
 Astrobytes: Breakthrough has it
 Stilgart: but is is more advanced in othello
 darkhorse64: Upvote this game&#160;!!
 struct: oh so its that one, if I search bitboarding on search bar nothing appears
 struct: only tech io guide
 darkhorse64: Actually, you can bitboard Onitama, Oware. Yavalath is where you can really do smart things
 struct: One day I'll try the games I ported
 darkhorse64: For Yavalath, the competition has been really fierce in the top 10
 struct: It was quite active 
 struct: At a time
 darkhorse64: I have fond memories of it because I learned really a lot
 leojean890: first players have nice openers on yavalath
 leojean890: makes me think of gomoku (I played that a lot)
 leojean890: 5 in a row without gravity and 15*15 or 20*20 board
 darkhorse64: you mean, openings&#160;?
 leojean890: yes
 darkhorse64: #1 has an opening book
 leojean890: I think I am around #30 on yavalath
 leojean890: oh ok
 leojean890: I watch their games et those openings seem to be really good
 leojean890: I hesitated to hardcode the same :P
 leojean890: not done yet xD
 leojean890: ow it's MSmits
 darkhorse64: I have no book except for the first move choice
 leojean890: I use my own heuristic for the moment to try to block the opponent
 leojean890: so you have something for the first move, and MSmits has more openings
 darkhorse64: If he finds a line that leads him to a loss that his bot is unable to solve, he adds it to his book
 darkhorse64: He went quite deep in his search
 Astrobytes: "quite deep" :D
 eulerscheZahl: as in: berserk mode
 leojean890: I heard that some people do that for UTTT :P
 darkhorse64: The same guy
 leojean890: if they lose, they play the situation locally
 leojean890: of ok
 leojean890: oh ok*
 leojean890: and then it's hardcoded&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: only a random map generator can prevent that kind of gameplay
 darkhorse64: Yes, it's efficient but is it really fun&#160;?
 leojean890: yeah, but it's not possible for every game :P
 leojean890: maybe less fun to use hardcode
 leojean890: I did it for some optims
 leojean890: A*Craft mostly
 leojean890: 15 lvl for A*Craft, 2 lvls for CvsZ
 darkhorse64: The fun is in the making of the book, the tools, the encoding
 leojean890: yes
 Astrobytes: Smits loves doing this stuff. The solving (or not), the search, the 'thrill of the chase' I guess
 Astrobytes: That's what it's all about
 leojean890: making local research opens more ways to exploit&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: And he's bloody good at it too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: he's really passionate to play the game for a long time
 Astrobytes: Yes, he has an admirable tenacity
 leojean890: he seems to go deep on analysis of games yes&#160;:)
 leojean890: some people do the same for CSB
 leojean890: I have just begun this multi
 leojean890: with an easy -3vel for the moment
 eulerscheZahl: try -e*v
 leojean890: oh ok e instead of 3 :P
 leojean890: should do a simulator one day for this game and search algo :P
 jrke: what is e euler
 leojean890: exp(1)
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl in German :P
 Astrobytes: e = eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: classic
 Astrobytes: :D
 leojean890: e = e^1
 JBM: i discovered this (U+2107) a few months ago: ℇ
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get the message behind that unicode. that's an epsilon, isn't it?
 jrke: oh so e=eulerscheZalh another constant

 Dan4Life: Ahhh... I see
 Dan4Life: So I've been playing with bots this whole time!

 jrke: i noticed some bots by my own like tychkorg,lanner,etc
 Dan4Life: AlkhilJohn
 jrke: is alkhijohn a bot or real man
 leojean890: they enable people to be able to play when they want even if no real player is there
 Dan4Life: I think he is a bot tho
 Dan4Life: So that means few people play cuz I see at least 3-4 evry single match
 Dan4Life: How about Unnamed Player
 Dan4Life: Is he a bot?
 WINWINWIN: No
 WINWINWIN: if CG made a bot, they give nicknames
 Astrobytes: And lots of real people do clash, just not all the time. The bots use real solutions from players.
 Dan4Life: I just found out you could check if they wer e bots from their accounts
 CFrost: how?
 CFrost: oh nevermind
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: it's unicode "EULER CONSTANT" (formerly "EULERS") (epsilon is U+03B5)

 MostComplicatedUsername: Dan4Life there are bots
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh lol I just scrolled down
 eulerscheZahl: Axel Voss (German politician) detects those by the gmail address. only bots would use a gmail to complain about his politics
 leojean890: there are many "unnamed player" on CG right&#160;?
 leojean890: even in the top sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: happens when someone decides to delete the account
 eulerscheZahl: or never set a nickname

 MostComplicatedUsername: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and now you are wondering why it doesn't pass? :D
 eulerscheZahl: delete it, start again
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well, I was reminded of it when d mentioned easy puzzles
 MostComplicatedUsername: Okay...
 eulerscheZahl: do you store all reached numbers?
 eulerscheZahl: that's common among those players who fail to solve it
 MostComplicatedUsername: idk, I know that it should work if there wasn't a time limit, because it's passing all the test cases except for the last
 MostComplicatedUsername: I think I'll just delete it and start again
 eulerscheZahl: I solved that in 21 lines of Ruby (MK mode activated)
 Astrobytes: Where did he disappear off to anyway?
 eulerscheZahl: the desert where CSB was recorded
 eulerscheZahl: the movie scene
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: to merge together as one, finally
 Astrobytes: Anton Skywalker
 MostComplicatedUsername: O:-)
 MostComplicatedUsername: 0:-)
 MostComplicatedUsername: huh
 eulerscheZahl: :angel:
 ekym: gg elym winning
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are not SeizedSilver
 Brokolis: eulersche - are you employed?
 Brokolis: I am just asking because any time I come on, you are here
 Astrobytes: Hover over his avatar Brokolis&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i have a job. 35h/week
 Brokolis: Alright! Cool
 eulerscheZahl: so during the week i'm offline in the morning + early afternoon hours
 jrke: so you work 7h a day
 jrke: or also on saturday sundays
 eulerscheZahl: 5 days a week
 jrke: k
 eulerscheZahl: except i have holidays
 eulerscheZahl: germany is great in that matter: 30 personal days i can take. and some public holidays
 jrke: top players in PR2 are resubmitting and wrecking other bots
 jrke: siman submits continously one after one
 Astrobytes: Yeah, he does that a lot
 Astrobytes: Every contest.
 jrke: and for a moment currently wala is also doing that
 MartinCiaffone: Hi, is someone aged +55 here?
 Astrobytes: I lost motivation to play
 Astrobytes: I'll go back to it though, it's a nice game
 jrke: who is  aged 55+
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol no one
 MartinCiaffone: I am 57&#160;:-)
 MostComplicatedUsername: I am 16 :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: I am exist
 jrke: im 13
 MostComplicatedUsername: BenjaminUrquhart how do we know that for sure???
 MostComplicatedUsername: You could be faking existence
 Astrobytes: Plenty older people on here MartinCiaffone
 BenjaminUrquhart: MostComplicatedUsername you'll just haveto take my word for it
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ig so :D
 MostComplicatedUsername: rip <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/472639480">https://www.codingame.com/replay/472639480</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: I need pathfinding
 Astrobytes: The 'contest' is almost over and you just realise you need pathfinding. RIP MCU
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well I knew that before
 Astrobytes: But you failed to implement it.
 MostComplicatedUsername: But I never joined to win the contest, I knew that wasn't going to happen
 MostComplicatedUsername: I just joined for the sake of joining
 Astrobytes: Yes but that's not the point. Play to learn.
 MostComplicatedUsername: But... but... random movement ftw?
 Astrobytes: You learned some graph theory no?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Maybe...
 Astrobytes: We spent long enough teaching the basics to you
 MostComplicatedUsername: mhm
 Astrobytes: You darn well better have remembered it :P
 MostComplicatedUsername: I'm using your suggestions rn
 MostComplicatedUsername: I just need some way to find the enemy's hq past 1 zone
 Astrobytes: Now implement a BFS
 jrke: do you know BFS MostComplicatedUsername
 jrke: just apply it
 Astrobytes: redblobgames.com MCU, have a look on there. Even has interactive examples and python code
 MostComplicatedUsername: okay...
 jrke: or you can also apply floyd warshall
 Hjax: i look at my pr2 bot and its like 150 straight games against just wala and siman
 struct: They are spam submiting
 Hjax: yeah lol 
 jrke: yes
 struct: You dont notice in contest because there are more players
 jrke: wala currently defeating everyone except reurse 
 Hjax: his record against me isnt incredible 
 jrke: his battles is 86% and he is 4th currently he is defeating dbdr and marchete i.e 2nd and 3rd but lose with recurse
 MartinCiaffone: are there other channels, besides this one?
 eulerscheZahl: language channels: #fr #ru #de ...
 eulerscheZahl: and you can create your own channels
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: #MartinsPrivateChannel
 eulerscheZahl: there it is
 MartinCiaffone: Thank you.
 eulerscheZahl: probably #es for you
 eulerscheZahl: meh, that channel is almost dead
 MartinCiaffone: I see, kinda lonely there... 
 eulerscheZahl: #world is the most active
 Astrobytes: Not everyone is a teenager MartinCiaffone, honest
 eulerscheZahl: fr and ru have some popularity too. rest is mostly inactive
 jrke: hey i wanna ask one ques is javascript little bit like c++
 jrke: in syntax
 MartinCiaffone: euler/astro - back to work, I expect to return from time to time to learn things. Thx.
 Astrobytes: No worries Martin&#160;:)
 jrke: Othello approved
 Astrobytes: But I wanted my leopard-print background&#160;:(
 jrke: Astrobytes,WINWINWIN and jrke approved Othello
 Astrobytes: Yes I see. Did you write a bot for it jrke?
 jrke: not yet will work on it after csb
 Astrobytes: Then you should not have approved.
 eulerscheZahl: i think you even have to set a checkmark on that before you can approve
 eulerscheZahl: Stilgart failed
 Astrobytes: How do you know the contribution is correct? You can't just take other user's word for it.
 Astrobytes: *sigh*
 jrke: no i have not written whole but normal code i have written
 Astrobytes: Yes, but you're supposed to check the input against the statement, check the input/ouput with the statement and viewer, verify the game mechanics etc
 jrke: i did that
 Astrobytes: Did you ensure the default code works with every language
 jrke: cheked in 4 lang ruby,javascript,c++,python
 jrke: and C also
 eulerscheZahl: fun story about bender optim approval: used to work, then a pixi update happened, viewer was completely black. got 2 approvals before the 3rd reviewer noticed it :D
 Astrobytes: It's also helpful to submit, even if it's just a random bot or whatever. To test against other opponents
 Astrobytes: Bugs can arise from real games as opposed to Default AI games
 jrke: k
 trictrac: hello all, I approved struct othello.
 eulerscheZahl: corner cases like crashing opponent: does the crashing player lose as expected?
 trictrac: but it's still blocked
 jrke: lol trictrac its already approved
 Astrobytes: Yes I remember that eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 struct: Hello tric trac
 eulerscheZahl: race condition trictrac
 struct: I guess you aproved at same time
 jrke: othello in Bot programming now
 trictrac: ok cool it's approved
 eulerscheZahl: and the fox already submitted
 Astrobytes: jrke - in future make sure you are much more thorough in your testing before approval, OK? 
 jrke: Ya ok :thumbsup_tone1:
 Astrobytes: Cool
 jrke: submitted random bot
 struct: Who will be the first to beat 1990 bot
 jrke: i got 9 defeats out of 9 random bot
 eulerscheZahl: because your opponent is very much not random
 Astrobytes: I'll put 0.5€ on tric trac struct
 jrke: ya i know that
 eulerscheZahl: then i go for jacek. just for the thrill
 Astrobytes: That's where my other 0.5€ was gonna go, I'll pick darkhorse instead
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: smits will manage to beat the fox. but not be the first to do so
 Astrobytes: *if* he plays it
 eulerscheZahl: true
 Astrobytes: (he will)
 eulerscheZahl: and that's most of the usual suspects already
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: it's always the same players at the top of board games
 Astrobytes: I guess Yurkov might join
 eulerscheZahl: maybe karl iso too
 darkhorse64: Thanks Astrobytes but my bot is not finished
 jrke: same here i will work on it tommorrow 
 Astrobytes: You still have time, don't fail me now darkhorse64&#160;;)
 jrke: and currently gonna sleep its 1 am in INDIA 
 Astrobytes: Goodnight jrke, get some rest
 jrke: ya for sure gn in advance to you also
 Astrobytes: thanks&#160;:)
 jrke: seems trictrac has also random moves
 trictrac: yes for the moment random move
 struct: You are already beatingf fox?
 struct: How?
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes: trictrac is a master struct
 Scarfield: dayum nice one :muscle:
 Astrobytes: that's why I put 0.5€ on him first :P
 Astrobytes: AlphaZeros will be incoming. If tric's isn't already!
 trictrac: I have a minmax structure ready and only genmove, playmove &amp; eval to provide
 struct: Ah I see
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Planning to try the alphazero approach though right trictrac? Going by your approval comment&#160;;)
 trictrac: yes I started on oware and never summit because i don't master the approach -&gt; my alphazero is weaker than minmax
 struct: I was gonna port Game of the Amazons next
 struct: But I have something else to do atm
 Astrobytes: Well, keep trying. I'm sure you'll get there trictrac
 struct: This was Astro suggestion
 Astrobytes: Yes, I like Amazons
 trictrac: I don't know this game
 Scarfield: Snu snu?
 Astrobytes: It's 10x10 chessboard-based, 8 queens, 4 white, 4 black. You move like a queen in chess, then you fire an 'arrow' using the same move limitations, the square the arrow stops becomes blocked
 Astrobytes: Last player able to move wins
 Astrobytes: It's used in many papers on game-playing alorithms and such
 Astrobytes: *algorithms
 Astrobytes: And it's a good game
 trictrac: very good proposal
 Astrobytes: Thank you, I thought so too.
 Scarfield: first you need to be no. 1 in othello in 2-3 weeks :p
 Astrobytes: After you HayField :P
 Scarfield: HetField?&#160;:)
 trictrac: for the moment it seems than jacek is providing a killer on othello
 jacek: wtf <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472649406">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472649406</a>
 struct: Wait
 struct: Now I see name in IDE
 struct: omg&#160;:(
 jacek:&#160;?
 struct: ide/puzzle/othello-1
 jacek: nah im just have barely working impementation. i think  i will for few weeks for now
 Astrobytes: That was a nice win tho
 Astrobytes: That means you need Othello-2 struct, Physics Edition :P
 trictrac: I a have a bug in eval for sure. no more piece is not good&#160;!!
 Astrobytes: Hmm :thinking:
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 jacek: ah yeah, i was winning short games
 jacek: never won against fox and i pushed trictrac down
 Astrobytes: Shame on you sir :P
 struct: Now he fixed it, we are doomed
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: Oh no I have a bug????
 Astrobytes: Where?
 struct: ah no
 struct: its tri trac
 struct: It was a lost game anyways so shouldn't matter
 Astrobytes: *you* have a bug or the game has a bug?
 struct: No bug
 Astrobytes: Just fail?&#160;:)
 struct: He played an illegal move
 struct: And I thought there were none
 struct: none legal mvoes
 struct: and it was his turn
 struct: thats why i got confused
 struct: but there were plenty of moves available
 Astrobytes: Oh ok
 AntiSquid: :o othello :o
 AntiSquid: and AutomatonNN is in it?!
 AutomatonNN: think i got the bugs for a bit of my time
 Astrobytes: Hi AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: hi
 Astrobytes: We've been missing your D submission in Othello
 AntiSquid: well i just beat struct with D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472653138">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472653138</a> first win of the day
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: The balance is restored to the universe
 AntiSquid: tryharding on kaggle atm and failing somewhat to understand some of the stuff
 Astrobytes: Which task(s) are you working on?
 lmntrix: don't know what to do here. I am new here. I need help
 struct: What do you need help with?
 AntiSquid: i've mainly went through their courses to learn the theory, forgot it since i first did it, forgot the syntax for the pipeline and function calls
 struct: hi AntiSqui 
 AntiSquid: hi
 lmntrix: I am new in codingame. I have no idea how to go about the site
 III: hi
 Astrobytes: Which parts are you struggling with AntiSquid? 
 AntiSquid: just the syntax and remembering the function names
 lmntrix: Please I need help help. Like a guidiance on how to get started in the codingame site
 Astrobytes: You'll get familiar again quickly AntiSquid, wouldn't worry about that
 AntiSquid: i mean you import some stuff from python ML libraries, put the data through a pipeline, adjust some values, submit and then keep readjusting some few things and resubmit, it's like CG without having to rewrite the referee basically :p
 AntiSquid: InvisibleStopwatch_9c1 do the onboarding challenge
 AntiSquid: use search bar at the top
 AntiSquid: and then try to do some puzzles or some really simple multi othello seems alright for that (don't get fooled by people telling you to do CSB, you'll hate it)
 MostComplicatedUsername: (Don't listen to anti, csb is awesome) :D
 Astrobytes: aw not this again
 Astrobytes: MCU how is your BFS
 Pooshlmer: Resubmit as another user?
 Pooshlmer: Whoops, mt
 jacek: oO
 struct: What hapened jacek?
 Bobbadillio: So, I'm thinking about replacing my Ultimate Tic Tac Toe HashMap with a BTree in Rust. 
 Bobbadillio: Should be a pretty easy change, but I feel like I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel :D This almost certainly isn't going to be the thing that gets me 10x more rollouts from turn 2&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: How many rollouts do you get on turn 2?
 AntiSquid: no but rust is perfect for bot hiding in contests
 Bobbadillio: 1800 rollouts
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Bobbadillio: Antisquid, what do you mean by bot hiding?
 Astrobytes: Tried bitboards?
 Bobbadillio: I store each subboard for each color as a 16 bit unsigned bitboard
 AntiSquid: when you send replay to IDE to try and find out why you lost the RUST bot times out since it's not in release mode so you can' test vs it new ideas
 Astrobytes: MCTS?
 Bobbadillio: I'm kind of doing MCTS, but not random. Doing a REAL random MCTS is probably a good idea.
 Astrobytes: MCTS with eval...or...?
 Bobbadillio: rollouts performed by best move on destination small-board. I can't remember what I do with a free play... That actually could be my whole problem right there.
 Bobbadillio: I've been away from my code for a few months
 AntiSquid: you expand based on probability no&#160;?
 Bobbadillio: I choose a node to rollout based on UCT bound
 Astrobytes: Also, do you preallocate your nodes and precompute sqrtLog and inverse sqrt?
 Bobbadillio: I'm not precomputing sqrtLog and inverse sqrt, but that definitely makes some sense to me.
 Astrobytes: Yes, they're quite expensive
 Bobbadillio: In terms of node preallocation, I use a zobrist hashing scheme to get node ID, and make/unmake moves
 Astrobytes: And a preallocated pool of nodes is useful. Don't make your nodes too heavy either
 Bobbadillio: I store node statistics in my lookup table based on the zobrist hash. 
 Astrobytes: I'm not too up on Rust but I'm guessing memory allocation during a turn is slower than allocating in the 1second you have on first turn?
 Bobbadillio: Or at least, the time is less sensitive in the 1 second first turn?  I make my lookup table with a capacity that (I believe) allocates all the space I expect to need. (about 2 million entries)
 Astrobytes: Rephrased: Guessing memory allocation is slow so best to do on the first turn (my mad, I apologise for the wording)
 JBM: so mad
 Scarfield: MadstroBytes
 Astrobytes: damn you JBM
 Bobbadillio: deeply angry :D So angry, I'm going to go profile where my allocations are.
 Astrobytes: And you MadField
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: lol Bobbadillio
 JBM: now that's anger
 JBM: True anger
 JBM: not like that anger where you just do more sims
 Astrobytes: The One True Anger.
 struct: Bobbadillio you get those numbers on IDE or Arena?
 AntiSquid: i thought true anger is when you delete account
 Astrobytes: Ohhhhh yeah Rust debug mode
 Astrobytes: good point struct
 Astrobytes: That's Truly Giving Up AntiSquid
 Bobbadillio: struct, I'm getting my numbers from the Arena, not IDE
 Astrobytes: Hmm, fox making a comeback but still losing hard against tric
 Bobbadillio: I'd love to have a web IDE that compiled with release mode, but oh well
 Bobbadillio: Also, lazy_static would be cool. I've considered doing some compile-time shenanigans with procedural macros...
 AntiSquid: someone remind me to do next contest in D
 Astrobytes: Will Do
 Scarfield: remember to do the next contest in D anti
 Astrobytes: ScarFirst beat me to it
 Scarfield: yuss
 Astrobytes: Lastrobytes&#160;:(
 Scarfield: xD
 JBM: you've been scarfisted
 Bobbadillio: Oo
 Astrobytes: or Scarified
 Bobbadillio: It's a Racer X song!
 Astrobytes: Racer X... Paul Gilbert?
 Scarfield: lol i wouldnt want to google that xD
 Bobbadillio: Paul Gilbert, yeah! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/yfXeO_Ff_Wc?t=57">https://youtu.be/yfXeO_Ff_Wc?t=57</a>
 Astrobytes: I'm no shred fanatic but Paul's a helluva guitarist, more than just a shredder
 Bobbadillio: Oh yeah
 AntiSquid: Bobbadillio get an avatar that doesn't look like JBM's 
 AntiSquid: gn8 all
 Astrobytes: Other than metal stuff I'm more of a Jerry Garcia type myself (waits for incoming hate)
 Scarfield: gn
 Astrobytes: gn AntiSquid
 Scarfield: tommy emmanuel is sick if you enjoy acoustic
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know Tommy, great fingerstyle stuff
 Astrobytes: I couldn't pick a favourite guitarist, nevermind a favourite musician
 Astrobytes: ('pick' see what I did there)
 Scarfield: no but tommy is definately up there for me&#160;:)
 JBM: pick me! pick me!
 Scarfield: CandyRatRecords is a great youtube channel for acoustic guitar players if you dont know of it
 Astrobytes: Check out Dick Gaughan, Scottish folk guitarist
 Astrobytes: Made some incredible music, a very fine guitarist
 Astrobytes: And the only reason I ever tuned to DADGAD
 Astrobytes: And check out Pierre Bensusan if you like DADGAD tuning stuff too
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAphofZCkfY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAphofZCkfY</a> i think this is DADGAD as well, but havnt played much for a few years now
 Scarfield: but like the scotsman&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Sounds like it could be yeah
 Scarfield: Andy Mckee is also one of my favourites
 Astrobytes: Good taste
 Bobbadillio: I haven't been following super close, but has Leo Kottke been mentioned?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7MqKDTUETk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7MqKDTUETk</a>
 Astrobytes: Check this, sorry for quality but it's lovely Scarfield:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ7oYCx6tBw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ7oYCx6tBw</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh good shout Bobbadillio
 Scarfield: listening to Pierre, he can guitar as well :o 
 Astrobytes: Ohhh yeah
 Bobbadillio: This Dick Gaughan guy is pretty good :D
 Astrobytes: Check out all his stuff man, he's a diamond
 Astrobytes: Anyway, g'night guys, nice chatting. Got an appointment with Better Call Saul and some food
 Scarfield: 2 sec astro
 Astrobytes: 2 secs expired
 Astrobytes: :P
 Scarfield: yea trying to find a guitarist that Guaghan reminded me of
 Scarfield: will find him for next time, cant remember his name&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Cool, please do!
 Astrobytes: gn for now anyway, take it easy
 Scarfield: gb
 Scarfield: gn *
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG1yUs0ybys">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG1yUs0ybys</a> Found him, Andrew White, but too late im afraid
 Scarfield: Leo Kottke is nice as well Bobbadillio, havent heard his music before i think
 yassineH: hi eveyone
 yassineH: gn eveyone hh
 yassineH: gn @AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: hi
 yassineH: good night @AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a problem with the code of the game and the output is easy enoug

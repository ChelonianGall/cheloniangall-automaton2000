 eulerscheZahl: miszu :rage:
 miszu: HIII :D
 miszu: how you doing?
 eulerscheZahl: well played
 miszu: wait
 miszu: it will go higher
 miszu: I improved even more but some cases timeout
 miszu: eulerscheZahl check now :D
 eulerscheZahl: 7th
 miszu: yup, that's my max now haha
 ANONYMOUS42: thank you Westicles
 ANONYMOUS42: i finally found the problem with my simulation
 ANONYMOUS42: what's the theory behind having x += velx + 0.5 * accx
 ANONYMOUS42: i thought it would be just x+= velx and velx+= accx
 ANONYMOUS42: i don't understand that + 0.5 * acc  part
 miszu: eulerscheZahl no but thanks a lot. You gave me good idea where to improve and it helped me
 eulerscheZahl: no problem, i'm always happy when others play "my" games
 eulerscheZahl: afk now, breakfast then work
 miszu: okay have a good day :D
 derjack: tutorial games like onitama?

 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Hello, peoples.
 None121232: You and your buddies are bored and decide to throw watermelons off high places onto the ground (Dont try this at home).The watermelons are thrown perfectly horizontally at a velocity of V from a height of Y.You decided to calculate the time it took in seconds (t) - rounded to the nearest integer, and the horizontal distance (X) it travelled before hitting the ground in meters.
 None121232: can anyone solve it?
 xoxoixo: guys does tthis thing really help
 Uljahn: what are you talking about?
 ForgottenSpoonAndHisDog_b2e2: hello my new friends 
 kimsejin123: hi

 kimsejin123: ang gimozzi
 eulerscheZahl: None121232 this doesn't look solvable as it is. What are the known values? the height?
 Uljahn: None121232: find the time of the free fall, multiply by horizontal velocity, ez
 GreatStopwatch_f89: gimozzi wdym?
 miszu: qq for all. The CG sponsored contest, is it hard to reverse engineer it?
 eulerscheZahl: not that hard. you will know when you did it

 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Hello, peoples. What have I been missing?
 Uljahn: a ban?
 LagunaElectric:&#160;?
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC:&#160;???
 LagunaElectric: Why a ban?
 eulerscheZahl: repeated spamming for days
 Uljahn: for your contribution to coding-related discussions being nonexistent
 TheBlueBias: HARRYPOTTERFANATIC ask a ban... :rofl:
 xoxoixo: anyof u guys got tips or tricks for me
 Astrobytes: Never eat the yellow snow.
 xoxoixo: i just started programming in school
 xoxoixo: still here?!
 TheBlueBias: ZappastroBytes

 Uljahn: xoxoixo: learn the basics, practice, learn advanced stuff, practice more etc.
 MASTER123:&#160;: )
 miszu: ok so the reverse engineering optimization problem... no idea how scoring system works. Feels like for COD BO: The number Mason... what do they mean?
 MASTER123: :joy:
 MASTER123: :no_mouth:
 MASTER123: :heart_eyes::yum:
 eulerscheZahl: won't tell, figuring that out is most of the fun miszu
 MASTER123: viet nam
 eulerscheZahl: MASTER123 please stop
 Astrobytes: Stop spamming emojis right now.
 Astrobytes: Or else
 MASTER123: ok
 eulerscheZahl: kick or banbecause it's still a few days for trick or treat
 MASTER123: ...
 Astrobytes: lol
 MASTER123: stop 
 Astrobytes: hammertime?
 miszu: there are 6 inputs to figure out. One of them is just the number of loops so that is nice... it's just the 5 others.. the outputs... and the scoring system
 MASTER123: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/19979951ca4872a314516de75994fe3de3a2139">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/19979951ca4872a314516de75994fe3de3a2139</a>

 TheBlueBias: eulerscheZahl: does the cgfp referee interpreter fully handles unicode chars in the program?
 eulerscheZahl: it does as far as java does
 eulerscheZahl: my solution prints the unicode from int values, easier than copy-paste
 TheBlueBias: Right. I copy-pasted though... ^^' But two validators don't pass with this new code, and I don't get why. :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: have you tried opening the contribution is you see what's happening?
 TheBlueBias: Running the referee you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/8243058ea8a7c2a0894e9b9196533a9a8a52bb">https://www.codingame.com/demo/8243058ea8a7c2a0894e9b9196533a9a8a52bb</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so you see the validators
 TheBlueBias: Oh! Well I checked them on github, but I'll check again this way. Thanks!
 TheBlueBias: Can't open validated contribs yet.
 TheBlueBias: The validators aren't all presents in this link. Or perhaps I can't see them because of my level?
 miszu: eulerscheZahl how long did you need to figure out the pattern?
 TheBlueBias: Pattern?
 SUNNFIT: Hello guys
 eulerscheZahl: i don't really remember, did that years ago. 1 afternoon maybe
 Robot15: yo
 Wontonimo: hey miszu, you beat me in 2048
 Wontonimo: tell me your secrets!
 Wontonimo: have you moved to TheBlueBias for good, or are you still using your other account?
 TheBlueBias: What other account?
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 miszu: Hey Wontonimo :D
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Uljahn: Wontonimo: it's not a secret java has no chances vs C++ with pragmas
 miszu: I was waiting for you to tell you about it
 Uljahn: gratz miszu
 miszu: thanks Uljahn
 Wontonimo: ah, so first is to switch my solution to c++
 miszu: yeah you need some speed here
 miszu: it doesn't matter that much but it's helpful
 miszu: however figuring out the CG reverse engineer problem on the other hand... I am staring at those inputs and outputs and can't see a pattern
 Wontonimo: hehe
 Wontonimo: i won't spoil it for you
 miszu: lol no one wants to spoil it for me :P
 miszu: that's okay
 eulerscheZahl: because that's the most fun part of the game
 miszu: but it took you a lot of time to figure it out?
 Wontonimo: i can give you a hint
 Wontonimo: but it'll spoil it
 miszu: ok don't say it
 TimothyAlexisVass: miszu did you look at the hints?
 Wontonimo: it took me a while, yes.  lots of looking at patterns, playing with inputs
 Wontonimo: no no ... don't look at hints&#160;!
 miszu: haha okay
 miszu: I won't look at it
 _NikJ: Finally beat the MightyCarlo in UTTT, jeez what a task
 miszu: all I know is one of the init input is just for the loop :P #cryptography
 Wontonimo: once i figured out the secret, the game lost all interest.  really, figuring out the secret was the really rewarding part
 miszu: not even trying to beat the score?
 Q12: I don't agree Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: congrats _NikJ&#160;!
 Q12: when you reveal the secret the game becomes a regular CG puzzle
 miszu: Q12 is right.
 Wontonimo: it does.  yes.  *just a regular cg puzzle*
 miszu: even the stupid scoring I can't understand lol
 _NikJ: Switched to a TS variant, was 1st for a while but couldn't beat the MightyCarlo @Wontonimo
 _NikJ: How do you tag people? I forgot xd
 Wontonimo: TS variant?
 _NikJ: mcts
 Wontonimo: yeah, you tagged me.  you don't need the "@" 
 _NikJ: If you recall I did MC sims
 Wontonimo: just the persons name
 _NikJ: Oh that's neat
 darkhorse64: I still have not figured out everything yet. Not sure for the scoring and maybe for the entities
 TimothyAlexisVass: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/27591350-cf61-46b9-8d30-2fb171d05d97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/27591350-cf61-46b9-8d30-2fb171d05d97</a>
 darkhorse64: But that was enough to climb high
 Q12: I won't say it lost all of it interest, because the puzzle for itself (without the secret of discovering the puzzle) is quit good
 Wontonimo: yeah, maybe i'll go back and give it more love
 darkhorse64: I am interested in 2048 hints, though
 eulerscheZahl: add up the hex digits TimothyAlexisVass?
 miszu: darkhorse64 :D
 eulerscheZahl: just do the snake and beam search
 Wontonimo: hey _NikJ , 2 things: 1 - you can press tab after typing the first part of someones name and it will autocomplete if they are online
 Wontonimo: 2 - do you know about the "solver" for MCTS?
 miszu: yeah snake a beam search is what you need
 miszu: and*
 _NikJ: Wontonimo, thanks, and no, I don't
 miszu: also make sure you remove dups states otherwised your beam will get suffered
 DomiKo: how about problem with 2^16? 
 darkhorse64: That's what I do but it does not go high enough like all ppl around 25M
 Wontonimo: i'll dm you about "solver" if you like
 miszu: darkhorse64 also check hardwarre limitations like int32 vs int64
 miszu: that was one of the issue as my ai decided to play dumb moves lol
 miszu: because I overflowed.. oupsie haha
 TimothyAlexisVass: oh
 eulerscheZahl: do you print all your actions? the full beam depth
 darkhorse64: I use 64 bits otherwise it blows up. I print only part of the beam and restart from this position
 eulerscheZahl: sounds reasonable. and you also remove duplicate states from the beam
 TimothyAlexisVass: Is there anyone who is proud of his/her CG reverse solution?
 darkhorse64: Not this one
 eulerscheZahl: there are lots of duplicates. your beam will quickly become a single state many times
 darkhorse64: I have no hashing 
 TimothyAlexisVass: I mean to survive longest...
 darkhorse64: Aha, probably the culprit
 eulerscheZahl: and soon i'll drop another rank
 eulerscheZahl: sigh
 _NikJ: My goodness, I just visited CSB leaderboard after not checking it for 4 years. I love how everyone is fighting within 35-38 points mark and then there's the top 3 guys. With reCurse reaching an insane 60+ points, just wow
 Uljahn: just NN things
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global</a>he completely destroyed us in the last contest
 darkhorse64: I have played with many parameters but whatever I do, after 32K is reached, my search goes into a dead end. The single state may explain this
 _NikJ: I love how FAR away he is from EVERYONE 
 eulerscheZahl: without him i would have said we are close to perfect gameplay, thus the similar scores
 eulerscheZahl: but in reality we are just equally far away
 darkhorse64: It reminds me of something written by Martin Fierz (Checkers fame) who thought checkers engines were perfect just before they got wrecked by NNs
 miszu: darkhorse64 I had that issue where it became single stated
 miszu: I created a set and checked how many states were unique
 miszu: found out only I had like 4 or so
 miszu: hashing is simple here as it is only a 4x4 grid to hash
 _NikJ: I recall him wrecking everyone on fantastic bits, few years back, by A LOT eulerscheZahl
 miszu: eveyrthing else is derived from the 4x4
 miszu: did recurse used NN in previous competition?
 Wontonimo: yes he did
 miszu: bruuuh
 miszu: how many repetitions of sims he did before the training was complete?

 _NikJ: Apparently, a lot more (or just better) than everyone else, considering how much he wrecks all others miszu
 darkhorse64: Time to dust my Zobrist hashing.
 eulerscheZahl: as far as I know this is the most liked comment on the entire CG forum
 <b>**eulerscheZahl uses Zobrist for 2048 too</b></p><p><img src="/a/3084076624888" /> Gabbek: hello everyone&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 _NikJ: HA! I knew I wasn't crazy, I remember a blue avatar absolutely destroying CSB with NNs back then (blue avatar being pb4)
 darkhorse64: No boss for LOA this evening
 Gabbek: how's the day going? What are you up to guys?
 eulerscheZahl: not much
 eulerscheZahl: kotlin heroes in 2 days
 eulerscheZahl: then the Huawei contest
 YassineGuem: learning some javascript, for developpement studies
 darkhorse64: Next CG contest in more than six months, if any
 Gabbek: cool, I wish you good luck! I was hoping I would enjoy the next contest but... uhh, gotta wait for non-escape contest I guess&#160;:|
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to look for alternatives
 eulerscheZahl: will be the first CG contest since the Accountant that i'm missing
 eulerscheZahl: even played detective picaptcha and locam sprint
 Gabbek: there's something pretty cool on kaggle, I remember nerchio sharing the link (think it's on CG discord somewhere)
 eulerscheZahl: Lux AI?
 Gabbek: oh yes, that's the name
 eulerscheZahl: what turns me off is the extremely long duration
 miszu: the real question is how he got a hand of an rtx 3080
 miszu: I am trying to buy one
 darkhorse64: exchange bitcoins against RTX
 miszu: I can afford one it's just the availability
 darkhorse64: RTX are all used for mining
 Gabbek: I haven't really touched any contests outside CG - just writing some bots to gold league and trying to get rid of truly crappy stuff. I'm happy as few days ago I re-wrote my fall challenge 2020 to something much better and managed to get top 100 gold - pretty happy with it, compared to previous silver bot&#160;:(
 miszu: not with the LHR version or w/e the acronyme
 Gabbek: btw -- pretty good exercise: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-hidden-fortress">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-hidden-fortress</a>&#160;; lost few days on it, but I'm pretty sure that others have solved it in an hour or a few, heh&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: yet another BFS&#160;?
 Gabbek: a logic puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling that it might be a max flow problem, but not sure (didn't think about if much)
 darkhorse64: a picross
 eulerscheZahl: if that's the same as nonogram: no
 Gabbek: a bit different than picross I think, but I haven't seen anything similar before
 darkhorse64: yeah, picross is french. That's what I thought reading the statement. I should read twice then
 eulerscheZahl: because the nonogram gives you numbers for the edges
 Gabbek: recently I found something quite unique: apparently slay the spire (pc game, roguelike deck builder) has mod support and you can develop your own AI to play the game&#160;:)
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtg0tredJg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtg0tredJg</a>
 Gabbek: pretty old topic, but I've never seen it before - if anyone would be interested I can help out with setup, as it's a bit confusing but it's working perfectly
 JacobTheCoder: hi
 Gabbek: good day
 JacobTheCoder: im tryna get better with my .lua any tips?
 Gabbek: sadly I don't know any lua; most likely there are some good tutorials on the web, but that's about it, sorry&#160;:(
 miszu: ok I looked at the hint. To be honest, I would not have figure out because i thought it was something to do with math
 Gabbek: have you found it on the web miszu? I tried to find something after like 3 days but... nope, no idea how it's called :D
 miszu: oh no there is a hint section in game
 miszu: give you starting point but that's all
 Gabbek: are we talking about the hidden fortress puzzle, or did I miss the context by mistake?
 miszu: it's the coding game sponsored contest
 Gabbek: ah, okey, I see what you mean now, thanks for clarification!
 struct: Are you going to change anything else in loa darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64: No, unless someone asks for a change. I just need to find the time for writing the boss
 <b>**darkhorse64 should not try to fix his 2048 optim</b></p><p><img src="/a/30071168356458" /> miszu: come on darkhorse64 :D

 MSmits: it works fine if you copy paste it fully. Also it's exactly as I pictured darkhorse64
 TheBlueBias: :smirk:
 69razer69: how to start the coding escape i gathered my team and i want to start
 eulerscheZahl: you wait 23 more days
 eulerscheZahl: and 3 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: gabbek can I see the fortress as a linear equation system?or are there multiple solution so that only the 0/1 condition makes it unique?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, worked for the first testcase. but not sure if it will always work out
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i could just dump it in numpy and see what happens
 Uljahn: :scream_cat:
 TheBlueBias: same
 jacek: :upside_down:
 eulerscheZahl: ok, got the 100% correct. but still not convinced that my solution will always work
 eulerscheZahl: 2 solutions are pretty much the same as what I did. and for the 2 others I have no idea how they work
 eulerscheZahl: and somehow once again my solution doesn't show up for others
 eulerscheZahl: hide and republish worked, shrugs
 TheSilent_Boy: .
 darkhorse64: #17. Near miss, eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: :scream:
 darkhorse64: My hashing was broken. Always question your code
 jacek: hm?
 darkhorse64: You got a 6M margin
 eulerscheZahl: that's not much
 eulerscheZahl: but as I told miszu already: i'm happy when others play my contributions. feel free to bypass me
 eulerscheZahl: for this one i've learnt some internals of the SDK to encode the replay more efficiently
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise the 1MB limit would have killed the idea
 jacek: still this is not true 2048&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: Same feeling for me for my two contribs. I like when your contribs push the limits
 darkhorse64: true 2048 scores less
 eulerscheZahl: the known spawn is the big difference
 eulerscheZahl: but also makes any known papers useless, which isn't bad IMO
 jacek: i have yet to make the n-tuple for 2048 useful
 miszu: "feel free to bypass me".
 miszu: I will not invade your country
 eulerscheZahl: invading my country would mean creating more complex contributions in CG terms
 jacek: :scream:
 darkhorse64: #15, :smiling_imp:
 eulerscheZahl: and only 3M difference now
 darkhorse64: I am not sure if parameter tweaking will be enough to win 6M
 eulerscheZahl: 6M? already planning to beat Neumann?
 darkhorse64: Just behind. I'll be happy to be within top 10
 miszu: darkhorse64 YOU SHALL NOT PASS ME
 eulerscheZahl: I once was. even first. long ago
 eulerscheZahl: the creator's advantage
 miszu: day 1: eulerscheZahl got first place while everyone still writing the sims :P
 darkhorse64: For the record, my hair is not yet grey and I have no beard
 eulerscheZahl: and trying to understand my github code
 miszu: I was talking about me
 darkhorse64: I was referring to TheBlueBias pic
 eulerscheZahl: my beard is slowly growing, home office made me lazy
 miszu: oh dammn... funny yesterday evening I was just 13th with like 50k difference or so from eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: before I used to shave once a week
 miszu: work from home for the win
 miszu: companies wants to force hybrid stle
 miszu: gtfo lol
 TheBlueBias: Shave?
 eulerscheZahl: now i shave once every 2 months or so
 Astrobytes: A Bearded Toad!
 darkhorse64: I am happy to see your avatar only
 eulerscheZahl: a stubbly toad
 jacek: TheBlueBias pic.. is this lavos?
 eulerscheZahl: it's his old pic, just in blue, isn't it?
 TheBlueBias: And upside down. But like the idea jacek ^^
 derjack: upside down avatar? lame
 jacek: did he kill the chat? oO
 TheBlueBias: He?

 PANDABOMB: Is this the discord for Coders strike back?
 PANDABOMB: Can I somehow get the coordinates of the next nextcheckpoint?
 Plizan: HI
 PANDABOMB: hi
 Cryptical: hello
 BCassady: calling all clashers!
 eeeeeee7es: hello clashers! :point_up::nerd:
 BCassady: I JUST CODED
 Wontonimo: OMG! 
 Wontonimo: what was it like BCassady?
 Wontonimo: hey PANDABOMB, yes you can get all the checkpoint coordinates
 Wontonimo: as you see them, save then in an array, then once you see the first one again, you know what is coming up next
 Wontonimo: there are also only so many different maps, so you can hard code all the maps into your code and identify which map you are in by the first checkpoint coordinates
 PANDABOMB: So you're saying that I should save coordinates as my pod touches them?
 Wontonimo: yes sir
 PANDABOMB: Is there a way to pull the coordinates of my opponent's current checkpoint?
 Wontonimo: what league are you in?
 PANDABOMB: Alright, so if I wanted to make a code that reacts to data pertaining to all the check points, I'd have to run that in the second lap
 PANDABOMB: bronze
 PANDABOMB: I just started
 PANDABOMB: I'm trying to get my pod to start turning before it even touches a check point
 PANDABOMB: So it drifts into the current target
 Wontonimo: yeah, your opponents info should be available in bronze
 Wontonimo: congrats for getting to bronze so fast
 PANDABOMB: All I have their coordinates
 PANDABOMB: That's it
 PANDABOMB: I think
 Wontonimo: if you simulate your pods location if it were to drift then you can check if drifting is the right thing to do
 Wontonimo: the calculations are all listed in the writeup on the left if you scroll down
 Wontonimo: down
 PANDABOMB: oh okay thanks
 Wontonimo: there is a 15% drag per turn, and a max turn of 18 degrees
 Wontonimo: i used a loop to look 5 frames into the future and simply check if my pod will be in the checkpoint area in any of those frames.  very simple check and it works really well.  it doesn't take into account that I actually turn or change thrust
 Wontonimo: if you do add those factors then it will be more accurate, but even just the friction and a look ahead of 5 frames will work wonders
 Wontonimo: have you read about PID controllers PANDABOMB&#160;?
 PANDABOMB: oh interesting. I can tell that my grasp of C# is not advance enough to simulate what you're saying yet
 PANDABOMB: lol
 PANDABOMB: But I really appreciate the advice
 PANDABOMB: I just finished a 3 month boot camp with the Tech Academy
 PANDABOMB: Im' still pretty fresh and Im' learning
 Wontonimo: would you like a hand with it?
 PANDABOMB: idk if you are familiar with C# but this is where I'm at

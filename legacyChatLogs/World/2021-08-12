 stormwings: what are you doing
 weabou: I'm dying on Ghost in the cell because i cant understand shit , so I learn ^^'
 weabou: and you&#160;??
 stormwings: playing with a friend
 martinpapa69: I just fixed an old bug in my code only by refactoring. very happy
 weabou: On codeingame or another game&#160;?
 weabou: resolving bug is always satisfying ^^
 Srinath_Mikaelson: hlo gamersa
 xxd: me, i'm just watching youtube and checking up on battles every so often
 eulerscheZahl: isn't refactoring about reorganizing the code while keeping the exact same functionality? so you failed Csipcsirip
 martinpapa69: no, refactoring is about making code, which is very nice in theory, but doesnt work
 martinpapa69: so ye, i failed
 StrikeBruv: how are the number of characters counted in clash of code? I seem to have had a high number of characters in my first clash. Are comments counted as well?
 martinpapa69: comments in clash?
 derjack: yes they are
 derjack: starter code has comments
 martinpapa69:  //comments count in your score as well. remove them before submit
 xxd: to get points for the contest category, it needs to be done during the live contest right?
 Uljahn: yes, fall and spring challenges
 -Gamma-: how do i turn off language assist 
 Uljahn: you should bloc lcp-community.codingame.com via hosts file or some addon such as umatrix
 -Gamma-: this is annoying me 
 -Gamma-: all right I'll do that
 Uljahn: sorry, lsp-community.codingame.com

 Mundgus: Hy!
 Mundgus: Somebody know how can I print an error message in python?
 andrefpoliveira: are bitmaps much faster than lists
 luukhf: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 andrefpoliveira:&#160;?
 andrefpoliveira: Python if it matters
 Mundgus: Yeah, I tried it luukhf, but it doesn't work
 Mundgus: Because the editor don't know the sys
 andrefpoliveira: Do "import sys" then
 andrefpoliveira: You must have deleted it
 Mundgus: Jeez :D
 Mundgus: Thx
 andrefpoliveira: np
 Mundgus: luukhf too&#160;:*
 luukhf:&#160;:)
 derjack: oO
 Uljahn: andrefpoliveira: bitmaps in python?
 andrefpoliveira: yeah
 andrefpoliveira: binary basically
 andrefpoliveira: and then shift operations to find numbers or wtv
 derjack: bit operations eh
 Uljahn: i guess lists are slow with large overhead but your implementation of bitmaps could be even slower, it all depends on a task and scale
 Uljahn: best performance gain could be from utilizing numpy to its fullest
 andrefpoliveira: im on connect4 ahah not sure whats the best
 martinpapa69: youre gonna need neural networks
 Uljahn: ah, you mean bitboards
 andrefpoliveira: ups yes
 andrefpoliveira: Is it possible to have neural networks herre?
 martinpapa69: ofc
 andrefpoliveira: Hmm the ones I tried all had files apart
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 derjack: no need for neural networks. good old mcts is enough
 martinpapa69: dont listen to him
 martinpapa69: troll
 andrefpoliveira: Ahahahah
 Uljahn: mcts needs rollouts, but python can't do them in suitable amounts, that's why you switch to c++
 andrefpoliveira: yeah I know ahah
 andrefpoliveira: I really need to learn how to use well c++
 andrefpoliveira: ah it uses Tensorflow dang it
 andrefpoliveira: I cant install it xD I never saw a more difficult library to install
 Uljahn: do you use conda?
 andrefpoliveira: I tried but was also all f***** up
 martinpapa69: pip3 install tensorflow
 martinpapa69: ez
 andrefpoliveira: i tried starting the navigator and couldnt
 andrefpoliveira: It says no available version (of none) lol
 Uljahn: navigator? i always use conda console
 andrefpoliveira: to install and stuff but yeah... I will try to uninstall python and then just install conda
 Uljahn: yes, that's the right way
 Uljahn: then just make a virtual environment, activate it and install all you need
 Uljahn: it also has seamless integration with VSC
 andrefpoliveira: yeah
 andrefpoliveira: Well will try it later :P
 andrefpoliveira: Now I need to study for a 4th try on an exam xD
 Uljahn: gl
 andrefpoliveira: ty ty
 andrefpoliveira: I need it xD

 theprogrammingguy: sup
 Swyfti: sup programmingguy
 JHowell: Does anyone know how the Clash of Code score is calculated?
 theprogrammingguy: There's an info icon in your profile
 ANONYMOUS42: if you got to your profile and then press the small (?) at the top right of the ranking square there is a detailed explanation on how the scores are calculated
 theprogrammingguy: under ranking in profile
 greenKeyboard: everybody gets high sometimes you know
 Maazo_o: thank you
 JHowell: Thanks everyone, but that's how the CP is calculated, not the score.
 michaellan: I'm not too sure how score is calculated
 michaellan: might be based off TrueSkill
 JHowell: What's that?
 michaellan: an algorithm that CG uses for ranking bot programming leaderboards
 michaellan: anyway, i wouldn't fret over score if I were you
 Astrobytes: Think he means at the end of a clash
 michaellan: no i dont think he means that
 michaellan: but i may be wrong, JHowell are you talking about the numeric value on the leaderboards?
 JHowell: My Code Clash score is 19.78, Astrobytes, and I'm wondering where that comes from.
 Astrobytes: "JHowell 09:42PMThanks everyone, but that's how the CP is calculated, not the score."
 michaellan: well, CP&#160;!= leaderboards score
 michaellan: the score is not the ranking
 michaellan: my score is 26.75 for CoC and I'm ranked 33rd at the moment
 JHowell: I assumed that was the case. Interesting.
 Astrobytes: oh on the leaderboard? TrueSkill and there is decay
 michaellan: yeah. the CP is based off of your ranking on the leaderboard
 michaellan: ah okay. I read on the wiki page that apparently you need Microsoft's license to use the TrueSkill algorithm
 michaellan: i am curious if CG has a license to use TrueSKill
 Astrobytes: It's based on TrueSkill, don't know if they actually licensed it or just did something similar
 michaellan: Licensing an algorithm seems like a pretty shitty thing to do
 AllYourTrees:&#160;???
 AllYourTrees: why is that a shitty thing to do?
 JHowell: Hm... It sure looks like the score makes the ranking.
 michaellan: i mean its just a math equation
 AllYourTrees: pretty sure most code on github has a license lol
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 michaellan: hmm
 michaellan: revised: i think putting a license where written permission is needed for a math equation is a silly thing to do
 JHowell: Anyway, I just went up 0.02 points after taking 15 minutes to get 50%. So I'm wondering if I went up because I got 2nd of 7, or if I was graded on every submission every for that problem, or something even more complicated.
 michaellan: it depends on other people's trueskill scoress
 BlaiseEbuth: And wind direction.
 JHowell: And moon phase.
 michaellan: What motivates the people who join clashes only to immediately submit with 0%
 michaellan: or are those bots
 BlaiseEbuth: What motivates the people who join clashes
 JHowell: I wonder if the 0% are just looking for easier problems. Maybe they think it's so hard that their only hope is to win 0% with the fastest time?
 RoboStac: I think it's often people who don't like that type of clash
 JHowell: Oh, that makes sense, too. I'm not particularly fond of shortest clashes myself...
 Westicles: Quest map, achievements, and mod rights
 michaellan: mod rights :eyes:
 JHowell: Oh, yeah. I'm a few clashes away from being allowed to accept/reject clash submissions.
 PlaasBoer: 15 min seems low for new people I need about 20 min atleast
 PlaasBoer: to finish the task
 PlaasBoer: Is there a bracket for higher completion times
 BlaiseEbuth: Puzzles
 michaellan: being able to configure times for private clashes would be cool, maybe up till 30m
 69razer69: yup 
 69razer69: btw how to start a private clash
 JHowell: At the bottom of the clash page there's a private clash button.
 Astrobytes: woo, level 32 and FB legend

 darkhorse64: Tell her to sing again. I miss her so much
 Astrobytes: lol, would if I could
 Astrobytes: Amazing voice
 darkhorse64: I have seen the band 3 times in my life and my english is too poor to express my feelings. It's my desert island band
 darkhorse64: perhaps with some Dead Can Dance records
 Astrobytes: I understand. No need for big explanations in English (or French).
 BlaiseEbuth: Your kouign amann band?
 Astrobytes: Are Dead Can Dance still going?
 darkhorse64: Yep but the inspiration is gone
 Astrobytes: Ah.
 Astrobytes: Were you into the Cure, Siouxsie, Joy Division etc too btw?
 darkhorse64: How did you guess&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hahaha right&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Still listen to all of them
 darkhorse64: I listen to Decades from time to time
 ANONYMOUS42: can you add photos beside the cover to puzzles
 ANONYMOUS42: I just added an illustration of the problem in the cover and it's barely visible
 darkhorse64: I think so because I have seen numerous with covers

 michaellan: ah, the posts are dynamically loaded so I suppose it's not powerful
 michaellan: I'm not sure how I feel about:
 michaellan: As you can see it’s very random, but it’s actually a good thing because you can always resubmit several times.

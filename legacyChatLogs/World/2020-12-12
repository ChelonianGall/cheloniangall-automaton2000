 Westicles: That wasn't my fault.  I didn't know you could do that until #FR told me yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: so you tested it?
 darkhorse64: It's not because you can do something stupid that you have to do it

 eulerscheZahl: oh, you can upvote unpublished solutions?
 AntiSquid: time to beat unnamed player?
 Westicles: yep.  You can get infinite XP easily.  I think that's what that one guy does
 AntiSquid: never thought wash up liquid would give me so much trouble btw
 eulerscheZahl: i think the same. the self-upvote is known for years
 Astrobytes: still struggling squiddy?

 darkhorse64: Let's call things by their real name: sabotaging CG. 
 Westicles: Just seems like a bug that needs fixed
 Westicles: I'll be happy to go right back down where I was
 Westicles: Then you can smirk and point at all the other guys who go down a little too&#160;:)\
 darkhorse64: You cannot blame others for what you are doing. This is a very lame attempt to avoid your responsabilities
 Westicles: People like to get angry about just about everything. 
 Westicles: It is tedious
 darkhorse64: Another lame excuse
 AntiSquid: kinda irrelevant, nothing to gain from extra level anyway
 Uljahn: at least you can have some fun exposing bugs by taking them to extreme instead of making a proper bug report
 Westicles: It really needs to be fixed.  I just upvoting existing ones, you can add as many copies of the same solution you want
 Westicles: I think some of the people complaining loudest are ones who do this as well.  
 AntiSquid: next we have a bug bounty contest on CG :P
 Westicles: Lots of loud complainers on #FR&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Unsupported "Trump-like" claims
 AntiSquid: the danger of this bug has been dispooted
 AntiSquid: and deboonked
 Astrobytes: Make a bug report Westicles
 AntiSquid: ^
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: Is Donald's Law the new Godwin's Law?&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I just said that, in reference to US elections, unsupported claims are not valid arguments
 Westicles: Oh please.  You guys are all arguing that I am rockstar over there
 AntiSquid: that's a different story, the hunter biden laptop was dispooted for a long time 
 Astrobytes: No, I get your point. It's just amusing how Trump seems to have replaced Hitler in online discussions :D
 AntiSquid: despite having called troops back home
 Westicles: bug reported
 Astrobytes: Squiddy, your missing the point. I'm not being political It was just an amusing observation
 Astrobytes: thanks Westicles
 AntiSquid: not directed at you .

 Astrobytes: Yes. Bombs contain pure democracy, that's how you spread it.
 Astrobytes: *'Western' bombs

 Levvis: You guys were gonna ban me for asking how to print yesterday but now you're talking about bombs?
 AntiSquid: don't think anyone wanted to ban you
 AntiSquid: anyways what are you up to?
 jacek: how to print bombs?
 darkhorse64: print("BOMB 0 0") to play Hypersonic
 AntiSquid: oh i thought he meant:import 3Dprinter
 mzbear: Levvis: if I recall correctly, you were reprimanded for telling someone to eat your shorts, not for asking a programming question. Fighting is a problem, and even if someone else offends you, don't be part of the problem.
 Levvis: can one not joke
 mzbear: be the bigger man.  if you get defensive, it only creates more drama and nobody likes that
 Levvis: I know the guy I said it to
 mzbear: yes, and he was rude first, but nobody else here cares to watch it go on.  if you want to bicker with your friends, don't do it in the world chat
 Maxim251: I am doing detective pickatcha ep 2
 Maxim251: Who finished that test?
 Maxim251: Is it dificult?
 Levvis: mzbear how is it any more reprehensible than the political discussion that went on in the world chat earlier?
 mzbear: i regret having this discussion. I've already said what i wanted to say so i'll go back to writing my bot for Blocking
 Astrobytes: He appears to just want trouble mzbear, ignore him. 
 Levvis: not really, but ok.
 Astrobytes: Move on with your life Levvis. Don't bring up your perceived slights and keep grinding that axe. Just get on with coding, chatting etc.
 mzbear: good conversations are about things, not about people, but everyone still has a tendency of making everything personal
 mzbear: meanwhile, my Blocking bot is already 600 lines and I'm going through a mild refactoring to make this thing cleanly support MCTS
 Astrobytes: I'm rewriting my raic bot
 Astrobytes: refactoring became rewriting
 Astrobytes: move generation seems tough for Blocking
 mzbear: i still haven't moved the development local... writing in the online editor despite it only showing roughly 25 lines at a time on this screen
 Astrobytes: That's just masochistic!
 mzbear: the move generation is indeed quite annoying, and i have so many unoptimized parts there too.. it currently takes roughly a millisecond to generate the moves in the worst case mid-game
 mzbear: a bit masochistic maybe, the outline scrollbar is super useful
 Astrobytes: Hm, don't over-optimise too early
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I have that in VS so I don't miss it too much
 mzbear: heh, i've gone down the premature optimization road too many times in the past
 Astrobytes: Easily done. Especially on CG
 mzbear: "this is definitely necessary and going to become a bottleneck, so i'll spend a day optimizing it" =&gt; the entire code gets thrown out 3 days later
 Astrobytes: hahaha, exactly right
 Levvis: are there bots in clash of code?
 Astrobytes: yup
 Astrobytes: just to fill the space when there aren't enough players
 jacek: ee
 Levvis: How did I not realise this before
 jacek: they passed turing test
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash</a>
 Astrobytes: Explanation there 
 Levvis: I've been getting beat by bots this whole time
 Astrobytes: And I think they have it in their profiles too iirc
 struct: At least those bots are fair
 Levvis: I've had a personal vendetta for this one guy who keeps beating me and it was a bot the whole time
 struct: When I quit clash it was bots submiting in under 10 secs
 mzbear: :D
 struct: and with golfed solutions
 struct: They would store published best solutions
 Levvis: how is it decided when they submit then?
 struct: I guess they calculate the time based on previous times
 struct: of other users
 Astrobytes: they use the code and the duration from the stored player
 Levvis: this is mildly embarrassing 
 mzbear: well, a real player once played that code, in that time... so it's still something you can aim for
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a>
 Astrobytes: Bots up top
 Astrobytes: Well, you didn't know until now so don't worry about it
 mzbear: even though they're real submissions, it's not entirely fair ... real people, even at high skill levels, can stumble on simple problems occasionally, so you can eventually have a chance to win against someone more skilled.  bots don't make such mistakes.
 struct: they dont submit 100% solutions everytime
 struct: I saw bot getting 0%
 mzbear: but it's the bot deliberately choosing to do so... so it's not exactly satisfying to win against that
 Levvis: it was satisfying before I knew they were bots at least
 Astrobytes: don't be put off
 Astrobytes: do you know about the #clash channel?
 struct: At least in multiplayers I know everything is a bot
 Astrobytes: lol
 Levvis: what is that
 Astrobytes: And the streamer notification up top also
 Astrobytes: there's a bot that collects twitch streamers doing clashes
 Astrobytes: So you can join sometimes really big clashes
 Astrobytes: And you can post in there and invite people
 struct: I remember joining a clash with 80 people
 Levvis: Don't think I'm cut out for that just yet
 struct: The result was never computed
 Astrobytes: Hey, people from all levels participate in the streamed clashes. From total noob to expert
 Astrobytes: I remember that struct, they fixed that issue right?
 struct: idk, I never faced a clash that big again
 Astrobytes: lol
 popupro: oh yeah, so far I'm still learning C++ and can't do most clashes of code
 popupro: I could never  do a big clash
 jacek: c++ isnt much used in clash
 Astrobytes: Yeah you should be pretty comfortable in your language first
 Levvis: &lt;python
 reCurse: The more you give up because of bots, the more bots are needed
 reCurse: Kinda ironic
 Astrobytes: Hah. Yes.
 sebak: hello
 Levvis: &lt; shortest mode
 mzbear: bots bothered me for another reason before i realized they were bots ... i saw people joining clashes and then leaving after a while when more people joined, and i thought they were leaving because too strong players were joining.  i thought they were fishing for high win ratios :D
 reCurse: Doesn't that make them more realistic then
 mzbear: Maybe, I don't know. i've only played a few clashes anyway because the experience was somewhat disappointing overall
 Astrobytes: Not my cup of tea either.
 Levvis: I only ever play clashes
 Astrobytes: Did you try the puzzles? Good training.
 reCurse: I'm just playing devil's advocate
 Levvis: Personally I'd prefer to do larger projects
 Levvis: outiside of codingame
 mzbear: I submitted one shortest code clash prematurely because I forgot it was supposed to be short, and got startled by the bell at 5 minute mark. I don't think I ever got notification how i fared in it, either
 reCurse: I think clashes are bad
 struct: They are
 Astrobytes: Tried the bot programming games on here Levvis?
 Levvis: Never done anything else that isn't clash I don't think
 popupro: I play clashes to just see where and what I can do, but I can clearly see when I'm just far below the level of the given clash since I'm still in 10th grade so I have to leave
 Levvis: Maybe one or two puzzles
 Astrobytes: I'd recommend checking them out. There's also optimisation and code golf.
 mzbear: Only the puzzles and bot programming feel meaningful here. Clash/golf/optimization all feel fairly pointless
 popupro: yeah I know, I try to get as far as I can in  the clashes
 struct: Multiplayers and Puzzles are the best things of CG
 Astrobytes: ^
 Levvis: I feel more incentive with clash because its competitive
 popupro: I mean, the clashes are good for someone who's  just starting out
 struct: Puzzles are
 Astrobytes: The bot programming is *very* competitive at times
 mzbear: code golf and optimization would be more meaningful if every player could submit their own test cases that every other player had to pass
 Levvis: But I mean I can play clash with friends
 Levvis: Clash taught me list comprehension at least
 Astrobytes: Well, when you're just getting bots in clashes you could learn some stuff from the puzzles I guess. There's a pretty broad selection.
 struct: nono
 reCurse: I would argue anything clash gives you is done better with puzzles, but that's obviously subjective /shrug
 struct: You should do CSB
 struct: use -3vx
 Astrobytes: New algorithms, data structures to learn, language features
 Levvis: Well I just like the clash normally only takes a few minutes to be honest
 Levvis: that*
 Astrobytes: Do what you wanna do, we're just making sure you don't miss out&#160;;)
 mzbear: Levvis, puzzles are kind of competitive too if you look at other people's published solutions after you've completed the puzzle. There's no referee to score the solutions though, you'll have to compare them to your solution on your own
 Levvis: I suppose so
 XorZy: Yes but  I agree with reCurse, I think clash are more for competition than to learn, except perhaps for shortest where you can learn to know your language better
 mzbear: it always annoys me (in a good way) when i see a solution that does something more clever than my own code :D
 Astrobytes: Bettering oneself is also a kind of competition.
 Levvis: I've never had a code-related interview but aren;t the clash problems closer to what an interview could involve?
 Levvis: aren't*
 Astrobytes: No. They're just supposed to be a bit of fun.
 Levvis: Surely there must be some benefit 
 reCurse: If a job interview resembles clashes, just get up and run away.
 reCurse: Thank me later
 mzbear: practice always has benefits
 Astrobytes: Puzzles are your best bet there. Codingame For Work sometimes uses the puzzles in interview tests
 Astrobytes: lol reCurse
 Levvis: But how long do the puzzles normally take?
 Astrobytes: How long is a piece of string?
 XorZy: It's really subjective I'd say
 struct: seconds
 XorZy: Depends on the puzzle and on your experience
 Levvis: I just mean is it something you'll do in a day or half an hour
 mzbear: there are some puzzles i've done in a few minutes, a few puzzles I spent several days on
 Levvis: Ah okay
 Astrobytes: Totally subjective and dependent on your experience/familiarity with the problem
 mzbear: and the nintendo puzzle i couldn't even finish... I still got a few A4 sheets on my desk trying to work out the math to solve it, but i just dont have any background in crypto math so i didn't manage to reduce the complexity enough to even bruteforce the rest of the solution space&#160;:/
 mzbear: i'll surely get back to that one later and solve it, damnit&#160;:)
 Levvis: I asked because obviously you're not going to be in an interview for several days
 Astrobytes: something something finite fields something something nintendo
 mzbear: good coding interviews with puzzles don't even expect you to finish the puzzle in a reasonable time
 Astrobytes: Yes, but you can improve your ability to solve problems by doing puzzles. So you'll get naturally faster.
 mzbear: the interviewer is usually more interested in knowing how you think, how you approach the task, etc
 popupro: while doing "clash of code" I learnt how to add to a string, how to find string length, basically I just learnt how to use strings
 Astrobytes: Well, you can do that with puzzles - without a time constraint.
 Levvis: So how should I prepare for a university interview  for computer science 
 popupro: I know, it just gets me in more of a competitive mood which just makes me perform better
 XorZy: If it works for you then go ahead, do what you like but don't forget to check out other things too, be curious
 mzbear: university admission interviews? here in Finland we just do an exam type of thing, and the type of questions were very different for different universities
 Astrobytes: I think that's university dependent Levvis
 Levvis: Yeah probably
 Astrobytes: Just make sure your maths + logic are on point in case you have some kind of aptitude test, other than that it won't be like thumbscrews and dim lighting or anything
 Astrobytes: (hopefully :P )
 Levvis: Hopefully
 Astrobytes: Nah. You'll be fine.
 mzbear: back when I got to study computer science in University of Helsinki, iirc the most programming related question was just a printout of instructions for a kind of pseudocode, and you were supposed to answer what the result of the computation was.  they didn't expect any CS students to actually know anything about programming beforehand...
 mzbear: be good at maths, be able to think logically, i dont think they had any oher requirements
 Astrobytes: They might ask you questions related to some stuff you've learned in highschool CS (assuming you're doing/have done highschool CS) but it depends on the uni afaik
 Levvis: As long as they don't ask for the pseudocode for merge sort
 Astrobytes: Revise it anyway, just in case&#160;;)
 AshKetchum: I had a c++ course, in the mid term test, I was asked to swap two integers without using a third var.I thought it was a pointers question because they were a mystery to me.Turned out, it was an algebra question.
 struct: What kind of uni is this where they require you to know merge sort before doing CS degree?
 struct: before starting*
 mzbear: no university does that for sure :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Levvis: Merge sort is part of the computer science A-Level syllabus - I highly doubt they'll ask for it
 mzbear: they might require math and physics skills though
 Astrobytes: cool, nice to see they include that in A level
 Levvis: We need to know merge, quick, bubble sorts
 struct: You are lucky
 struct: They asked me to do NN
 Astrobytes: Nice. Well, if they don't ask you about them maybe you can humblebrag a bit :D
 Levvis: NN in the interview?
 struct: yes, in the interview for CS degree
 Levvis: How does that work then
 mzbear: i was once asked to write code on a chalkboard, with actual chalk, in a job interview
 struct: I was joking
 struct: I dont think you should worry too much
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Just be ready to get stuck in and work your ass off
 Levvis: It's virtual anyway
 IamFish: wait you guys need to pass interviews to get into college?
 YodaMaster123: Not all colleges.
 Levvis: It's only for certain universities
 IamFish: ah
 Levvis: Only for the particularly evil ones

 Showya: yo wassup
 struct: I have to agree with his comment
 struct: But you can just add an or to check for n
 Maxim251: WOOOO I finished! All test cases!! Of Detective Pikaptcha EP2:heart_eyes:
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9e3fa9b3-249c-43f4-81a8-8cb5e4731723">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9e3fa9b3-249c-43f4-81a8-8cb5e4731723</a>
 struct: if it ends with n i mean
 struct: grats
 LastRick: now do episode 3 . i can't get past the problem statement on that one
 struct: oh wait my solution deosnt work 
 Maxim251: My code is so extremly long, it scares me. I dont know how I do it that it works :hugging:
 mzbear: i'm working on 600+ line long bot code, in which i've recently touched ~300 lines without testing ... there's no way i wont have to debug this for hours after i'm done implementing the algorithm i'm currently working on :D
 mzbear: the only downside of bot programming is that i cant shove my code at everyone's face once i get this to work
 Maxim251: my code have 409 lines with debugging. 
 Maxim251: I am begginner and first time I get code so long and its worked after few touches and corections.
 Maxim251: I wish You the best with You r code. 
 mzbear: my trick to managing my code: i start by layout out only TODO comments and now code, and after that i write assert(0); to every block of code I make before i start implementing it, and only remove it once i've carefully read what i've written to be sure i wrote it correctly.  this way i can take detours and never accidentally forget to finish something
 mzbear: s/now code/no code/;
 mzbear: and i keep the word "TODO" in every comment until i've written the entire functionality it describes
 mzbear: so my source code doubles as a design document
 Maxim251: I do my code from head. Step by step, First time I also implemented obiects to contain information like map or hero. But ifstatements I did in main loop. Things responsible for updating map or hero I put in side classes, and only if statment for comparison two obiects I du in main. But anyway, It was so hard, espoecially that at begginning I coudlnt start code to test it, but write 80% of it and then start it to see how works first step... 
 Maxim251: I try do todo beetwin days, to not forget where i stoped previouse days.
 Maxim251: But I am new and still that field is for me new. And i dont have experience how to do step by step corect code like You do. 
 mzbear: i cant handle keeping things in my head, i always forget important things once the project starts growing larger... aggressively asserting everything in the code is the only way i can make anything work reliably
 Maxim251: Thats why I am happy like monkey on tree that I get it fully working
 Maxim251: I start to train with struct or classes, because there I can group some important or usefull functions. 
 mzbear: i usually try to first get something to work before i start organizing anything.  it's far too common to not completely grasp the problem until it's been solved
 mzbear: every time you create a function, or define a struct, you create architecture ... and it might not adhere to a good solution
 mzbear: so, first iteration of the code, i make a mess that's explicit on what it does, and easy to refactor once i have a clue about what i want to do
 Maxim251: maybe thats why it was so hard
 mzbear: creating abstractions too early always tends to go wrong for me
 Maxim251: most of the time I have problems with swaped x and y in 2D arrays. Later I spand many times to figureout why I get wrong values
 therealbeef: optimizing too early is usually wasted effort
 mzbear: whenever i declare multidimensional arrays, i add a comment describing what each index is&#160;:)
 mzbear: int form_handles[21][8][5][5] = {}; // id, form, y, xstd::pair&lt;int,int&gt; handle_locations[21][8][5]; // id, form, (handle-1)
 mzbear: although i only tend to do it when i'm not following my own conventions ... for example, i didn't document that pair&lt;int,int&gt; because x,y is my default for coordinates of any kind
 Maxim251: For me works great. Because I imagine that map is an obiect. It have size, 2D array of some information like grid, and help functions to get some info from the map. Like center point, update point, change data in that point. That basics one, but logic I use in main function, because for me keep everything in class is still unavaible. For me classes are like containers to keep info. 
 Maxim251: heh In that code I try use pair, but later one it make me to complicated to menage that. And I finish with x and y like You&#160;:)
 mzbear: i've recently been getting into a bad habit of making everything structs instead of classes, and only using member methods for things truly inherent to the data.  everything else, normal old fashioned functions
 mzbear: no privates whatsoever
 mzbear: it's not like encapsulation does me any good by itself, and having everything public saves me the trouble of writing accessors for the various things that i keep changing all the time
 Astrobytes: yeah, CG special.
 Astrobytes: using namespace std; structs not classes. Almost zero encapsulation.
 Astrobytes: All foul and dirty code allowed. Smells left, right and centre.
 mzbear: i still go without "using namespace std;" as much as i can.  at the moment, only main() has it because i didn't want to add the std:: to all the boilerplate input reading
 Astrobytes: Well, contest code at least :P
 Astrobytes: I don't bother too much about the std thing on here, depends what I'm up to
 mzbear: there are times when i really want to drop the std:: though... hell, earlier i had one of those arrays as std::array&lt;std::array&lt;std::array&lt;std::array&lt;int,5&gt;,5&gt;,8&gt;,21&gt; form_handles;
 mzbear: that made me cry
 mzbear: after briefly questioning my sanity, I just went with C style arrays
 Astrobytes: I never use the std arrays on here I have to say
 Astrobytes: well, very seldom
 therealbeef: typing std everywhere is too baked into my coding now haha. feels weird to leave it out
 Astrobytes: do whatever works best for you is what I say&#160;:)
 Maxim251: I need say something about std
 Astrobytes: ...
 Maxim251: I dont know why some peoples hate STD in a fail, namespace::std was desighned to use it. If You use another library and file menaged that library, You use namespace::QTCore or whatever
 Maxim251: I use almost always in main because it saves me a lot of typing. And I dont mixt with other library that two namespaces will colide
 Astrobytes: Yes, for sure
 Maxim251: Namespace is desighned that programer will have easier life. 
 Astrobytes: on CodinGame I just use using namespace std because I don't need to worry about any other libs
 Maxim251: exactly. If someone is ignorand, it always will use witjout namespace because somebody tels him so
 Astrobytes: Yes, many people do such things without realising the consequences.
 Maxim251: I am new on coding And I am learning from 3 months now, but I already know when to use namespace and when stop it if My code don't need so many lines with standard functions.
 Maxim251: #Astrobytes good luck with Your code. And was so nice to talk about coding preferences. 
 Astrobytes: thank you Maxim251, and the same to you
 Maxim251: #mzbear struct and class is almost this same, but struct difference is that You are not forcet to point it what is publick and what is not. This is good to use in one file like codingames chalenges. If You write some sort of library that many other peoples will use Your talent, then class can be usefull to menage private some variables. 
 mzbear: enforcing the interface to data becomes a lot more relevant when there's more than one programmer, yes&#160;:)
 tibithegreat: to be tehnically correct in a struct all members are by default public
 tibithegreat: you can still set private members in a struct
 Astrobytes: yep
 Maxim251: ps, struct was desighned to be used in C, that was some response for C++ classes, and because C++ have suport to C language, now we have them two with coise to us eit.&#160;:)
 Maxim251: sh..t Sorry for typos
 Maxim251: choice to use them.
 mzbear: i'm contemplating whether to start writing code for experimenting with MCTS+RAVE before i even get the MCTS code written. I'll never get this done before the week is over at this pace :D
 reCurse: ...what? Struct existed in C way before C++ even was a thing
 Maxim251: no no, I writed that was response for C++ classes.
 tibithegreat: yeah and recurse says it wasn't&#160;:), C had struct before C++ even existed
 tibithegreat: and C++ had to be backwards compatible with C
 Maxim251: Struct come up later, because C programmers dont have that, and obiect type container is very usefull.
 tibithegreat: cause.. reasons
 Astrobytes: Um
 tibithegreat: hmm, let me check my c++ history, I think you might be wrong
 reCurse: K&amp;R C had structs
 reCurse: That's in the 70s
 reCurse: So no there's no way it's a response to C++
 Astrobytes: ^
 tibithegreat: yeah&#160;:)
 reCurse: Not sure where you're getting your info from
 tibithegreat: made me doubt myself for a while there
 Maxim251: I watched one of Youtube explanation about many types of thata and why we have so many different types containers. And this what that person said. Normally on internet is very hard to find why struct exist if class have almost this same functionality.
 reCurse: Very hard?
 reCurse: The only reason it exists is because C++ is a superset
 reCurse: It's exactly the same except it has implicit public: instead of private:
 tibithegreat: basically C had structs, and when they made C++ they decided it should be backwards compatible
 reCurse: Because there's no accessibility in C
 reCurse: It's not exactly hard information to find
 tibithegreat: a decision that is controversial to this day
 reCurse: You should unsubscribe from that channel
 Astrobytes: Immediately.
 Maxim251: Yeah?? Why they do it if I can write at beggining that all members of clas I want have publick? Is onlu few chars to typo.
 reCurse: I just told you, because of backward compatibility, it's designed to be a superset
 mzbear: c++ was originally called "c with classes" ... it had all the C functionality intact
 Maxim251: Struct is new. And C users can also use struct. Class for C users are not avaible.
 tibithegreat: no
 reCurse: No struct is not new
 reCurse: Please stop spreading misinformation
 mzbear: lol
 mzbear: where's my popcorn
 tibithegreat: I recommending the Bjorne Stroustrup about c and c++
 tibithegreat: if you really want to know about this stuff
 tibithegreat: I may have typoed the name and name of the book there
 Maxim251: Then my source was wired, because it stay in my myind
 Maxim251: I need again look info about struct... 
 mzbear: i'll just drop this here:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf">https://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf</a> - A History of C++: 1979− 1991 ... directly from the horse's mouth
 Astrobytes: as reCurse said, struct came from C.
 mzbear: perhaps you've misunderstood something
 Astrobytes: In C++ struct has everything as public by default, because there was no notion of this in C
 struct: sruct is to be released on c++2
 struct: c++20
 mzbear: the "struct" keyword is slightly different in C compared to C++
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 tibithegreat: @mzbear huh?
 tibithegreat: how is it different?
 mzbear: because C requires it to be used when declaring variables of struct types
 tibithegreat: it should be the exact same thing as in C
 reCurse: He's right, it's slightly different in C
 reCurse: But it's just syntax
 mzbear: if you have struct Foo {}; ... in C++ you can say Foo x; .. but in C you need to say struct Foo x;
 reCurse: Conceptually it's the same
 Astrobytes: yes but lets not split syntactical hairs for this guy rn
 tibithegreat: wasn't the whole thing that a C++ compiler should be able to compile C code?
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)</a>
 reCurse: Yeah the problem is at a much higher level here
 reCurse: No need to dive that far
 Maxim251: wiki about C struct, but still I am looking
 mzbear: i suspect maxim's misunderstanding originates from some factual information, that has been interpreted wrong
 mzbear: the difference in the syntax might be such a thing
 Astrobytes: Could be either way. There is a lot of bullshit on the interwebz
 struct: This is why I use classes
 mzbear: struct: don't tell me you get a notification every time someone says struct
 reCurse: I don't know if there's youtube for flat earth conspiracy, there's certainly room for youtube saying there was no struct in C until C++
 struct: What do you think?
 struct: 20 red texts
 Astrobytes: Exactly reCurse.
 Astrobytes: Wonder if someone will use tobou as a keyword one day :thinking:
 tibithegreat: flat earth conspiracy isn't even the craziest conspiracy out there
 Astrobytes: Let's not go there.
 Astrobytes: For our own sanity.
 tibithegreat: fair enough&#160;:)
 reCurse: If I cared for my sanity I'd stay out of webchat :thinking:
 Maxim251: In C++, a class defined with the class keyword has private members and base classes by default. A structure is a class defined with the struct keyword.[1] Its members and base classes are public by default. In practice, structs are typically reserved for data without functions. When deriving a struct from a class/struct, default access-specifier for a base class/struct is public. And when deriving a class, default access specifier is private. 
 Maxim251: Text from wiki
 Astrobytes: lol, I'm having a 'break'&#160;:/
 bwa: Structs vs classes, public vs private
 jacek: do we hilight him much?
 reCurse: Meanwhile Python has exited the conversation due to an exception
 tibithegreat: bwa: C++ would train an entire neural network by the time python would finish sayng "I'm sorry what?"
 bwa: You do know CPython, right? :D
 tibithegreat: may have exagerated a bit&#160;:-"
 mzbear: python is for people who value developer time more than runtime
 tibithegreat: I've heard about it, didn't use it tho
 reCurse: lol
 reCurse: Value developer time?
 bwa: If you used python, you've almost surely used CPython
 Maxim251: To day I fill that I will not find that info about What I was talking about. But I heard that info and it stays it in my mind. Maybe that source was wrong... 
 reCurse: As in "wtf is that parameter supposed to be"?
 reCurse: Yeah not sure about that
 reCurse: It's close to a write-only language
 mzbear: haha, sure if you abuse tuples, and i suppose you will
 reCurse: Add a tuple to your return? Oh I'm so sorry about all your code that just broke
 tibithegreat: I mostly use python when I want to do some data manipulation really fast and don't care about speed or anything
 reCurse: Have fun fixing all calls
 tibithegreat: like I have some raw data and want to get some kind of statistics
 mzbear: but i've found that developing things in python is super fast.  then again, i've never done anything big in python
 tibithegreat: it becomes a bit of a pain when you have large codebase
 reCurse: Or all that time I spend into how to write as little python as possible by abusing vectorization so it's relatively faster
 reCurse: Even if straightforward imperative C++ shitty code would run 20x faster
 struct: Its only faster if you know it
 reCurse: So much about dev time...
 Maxim251: Python is bunch of sort of functions, where in C++ You need most of that basik stuf write Yourself.
 tibithegreat: for 40-50 line straightforward code I do preffer python
 tibithegreat: if I don't care about performance
 reCurse: Ever grabbed random python code and wondered wtf those argument types are? Yeah.
 therealbeef: reCurse a lot of those python problems can be avoided with good unit tests, though
 Maxim251: Yeah, Then You wait 10 times longer to finish program.
 reCurse: No sorry I call bullshit on that
 mzbear: for example, python generators are awesome.  maybe c++20 coroutines will bridge that gap a little, though
 tibithegreat: I didn't say anything about reading  someone else's python code
 Maxim251: But I agree, Pyton is super easy language, 
 tibithegreat: I said about writting python code for a task
 reCurse: Sure, write-only language
 Astrobytes: you can specify types no?
 tibithegreat: like for example if you want to find out how many reachable states there are in a tic-tac-toe game
 reCurse: If you can I have yet to come across any code that makes use of it
 tibithegreat: and wiki didn't provide that answer
 tibithegreat: that's just a random example of where I would write a quick python program to find out the answer
 reCurse: Especially since it's apparently idiomatic to have an argument supported to be an int, a list, an object or whatever
 reCurse: And you hope the documentation is up to date
 Maxim251: ps, Python is more like script, C++ is real language. And at last, Python is build from C++&#160;:)
 reCurse: Or existing
 mzbear: python types aren't for the runtime, they're for tooling
 tibithegreat: well python is a scripting language
 tibithegreat: that's how it started if i remember correctly
 Maxim251: yeah&#160;:)
 tibithegreat: just that probably a lot of newcome programmers started learning because it was "so easy"
 tibithegreat: market share grew
 tibithegreat: and companies started using it in large codebase because they could find programmers easily
 Astrobytes: yeah I think from 3.6(?) you can do var: type = soemthing
 Astrobytes: *something
 reCurse: I have not seen any code in the wild using it
 reCurse: Not in ML spheres anyway
 Astrobytes: No, I haven't. I've used it for sanity reasons now and then however. 
 tibithegreat: oh and I suspect ML uses it a lot because most people doing ML have a more academia background 
 tibithegreat: rather than coding background
 reCurse: Sure
 mzbear: i've used python type hints here on CG, but that's just me, and i cant remember which puzzles i've used them on since i dont keep local copies of my code
 reCurse: That's what driving me up the walls
 bwa: Python type hints are only for your IDE
 reCurse: Well if it can do static validation that would be something
 reCurse: But if most libraries you use don't make use of it
 reCurse: Or most examples or codebases you find don't use it
 reCurse: Not much point is there?
 bwa: We don't use them much, yea
 tibithegreat: but the thing about type hints is something that's valid in a lot of languages
 Astrobytes: Still find it odd that this fairly generic scripting language has become what it is today, and as popular as it is today. Considering when we were all using perl back in the day, python was just hanging around for the odd task here and there
 tibithegreat: php, js etc
 reCurse: You have academia to thank for that
 reCurse: Though I guess they could have chosen worse
 reCurse: Like all ML done in perl
 tibithegreat: Astrobytes: I'm more surprised about how big JS is nowadays
 reCurse: Maybe I definitely wouldn't bother then
 Astrobytes: Haha, now that would be something indeed
 Astrobytes: Yes, also that tibithegreat
 reCurse: Torch was initially in Lua
 tibithegreat: I used to do webdev like 7 years ago before I went into gamedev
 reCurse: Possibly worse than Python
 tibithegreat: and js was like ... something very limited for client-browser only
 Astrobytes: I did webdev 2000-2001
 tibithegreat: and jquery came by and people were like "oooo large js codebase"
 reCurse: Oh you're at ubisoft too
 reCurse: Eh
 therealbeef: back in the day we did a lot of ML in matlab lol
 tibithegreat: and now it's like
 tibithegreat: what the hell happened, why are we writting server code in js
 tibithegreat: recurse: yeah I'm at ubi as well&#160;:)
 reCurse: Because to share the existing marvelous frontend js ecosystem
 reCurse: Have to spread the can...glory
 tibithegreat: yeah allowing frontend programmers to dive into backend was "great"
 Astrobytes: Makes my skin crawl.
 mzbear: php is depressing.  i actually did some php webdev for few years some time ago.  one day i even got fed up with it so bad that i went to buy a bottle of rum in middle of workday and shared it with any coworkers who wanted to listen to what i had just found in the php's source code
 tibithegreat:&#160;:))
 bwa:&#160;:) PHP had a good run, it's time for it to go
 Astrobytes: People say it's better these days...
 bwa: Yea, it's called Python
 mzbear: i dont remember why, but i had a need to read the Zend runtime compiler and it vividly resembled 60's tech innovations
 Astrobytes: heh
 mzbear: the language has changed a lot since then, though.  nowadays they actually make a syntax tree before they start executing it
 reCurse: But think of all the jobs it created at facebook
 reCurse: Retrofitting PHP code for years
 reCurse: Into C++
 Astrobytes: Go figure
 mzbear: it's also hilarious how the == operator keeps changing between php versions
 tibithegreat: I actually did 2 internships at facebook
 tibithegreat: around 2009-2010
 tibithegreat: they php code was also a mess
 Astrobytes: I gave up on it in the mid (I think) 00s. Trying to maintain forums and other CMS systems was just ridiculous
 tibithegreat: maybe it got better now but at that time it was quite messy
 Astrobytes: There was no clean PHP code then or before
 tibithegreat: the most noteworthy moment was when I wrote some code somewhere that was pretty deep
 Astrobytes: It *invited* messiness
 tibithegreat: and php triggered a warning because I did something weird
 tibithegreat: but I was so deep and the callstack was so big
 reCurse: Well it's possible to write it clean, but when the path of least resistance is littered with pitfalls
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hack.fi/~muzzy/php/php5.3.3-comp-op.html">https://www.hack.fi/~muzzy/php/php5.3.3-comp-op.html</a> .. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hack.fi/~muzzy/php/php5.4.5-comp-op.html">https://www.hack.fi/~muzzy/php/php5.4.5-comp-op.html</a> .. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hack.fi/~muzzy/php/php5.5.8-comp-op.html">https://www.hack.fi/~muzzy/php/php5.5.8-comp-op.html</a>
 tibithegreat: that the error handler crashed
 reCurse: That's what you end up with
 Astrobytes: haha
 mzbear: there's comparson of the == and === operators for three versions of php back when i was working with it
 mzbear: (and don't ask me why i was working on a codebase that had NaN for associative array keys)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm not gonna talk about PHP from before that. Even PHP devs don't talk about The Dark Times.
 tibithegreat: @mzbear what the hell&#160;:))
 Astrobytes: Sorry, we do have to at least question that if not ask directly
 mzbear: "we started writing this product with lotus notes and rewrote it in php later, the guys from back then have moved on already, as have the next guys, and the next guys, ..."
 Westicles: Is Haskell worth learning?  The solutions I see are always so short and elegant looking
 reCurse: Excuse me while I go puke
 Astrobytes: LOTUS NOTES
 reCurse: Depends on your objectives Westicles
 Astrobytes: Haskell (for me) is a lot of hard work. But it sure as hell can be elegant.
 mzbear: significant part of haskell code looking elegant is because of the type of people who prefer to write haskell code
 reCurse: lol
 reCurse: Seems quite accurate
 Astrobytes: hahaha, that is possible
 Westicles: Good point.  It is really just 2 guys
 mzbear: and then there's <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview">https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview</a>
 Astrobytes: I haven't finished but that's rather good
 Astrobytes: *finished yet
 Astrobytes: Ended up clicking on 'Rewriting the Coding Interview' (Clojure). Stopping now.
 reCurse: So this is what art looks like
 Astrobytes: The magic is lost upon viewing.
 therealbeef: is haskell a bit like Prolog?
 JBM: sure
 Westicles: The nice Haskell guy appears&#160;:)
 therealbeef: it is great to program in that kind of language
 therealbeef: template programming in C++ is a lot like that too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how does Westicles get 45k XP all of a sudden"?
 <b>**Astrobytes goes back to raic</b></p><p><img src="/a/55595180001313" /> Westicles: I got a settlement from libel suit against Velcro

 Astrobytes: *theme
 JBM: what about this time?
 JBM: the good XP vs the bad XP?
 Astrobytes: Perhaps. Sounds reasonable.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: editor on CG still broken?
 Westicles: learning how to like yourself
 Astrobytes: Still needs elements of the former issue with that name though.
 JBM: meme time
 JBM: *ALWAYS WAS*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup editor is still broken
 Astrobytes: Like it Westicles? :D
 Astrobytes: I liked my word play in the title at least.
 JBM: narcissistic xp
 Astrobytes: Or maybe a theme of broken CG features.
 Astrobytes: That could be quite a series.
 JBM: aoc-like fodder
 Westicles: These poor teenagers doing the clashes are going to be so confused
 JBM: lol
 AntiSquid: how about puzzle name: hard earned xp 
 Astrobytes: Westicles-JBM-Velcoro collaboration FTMFW
 PatrickMcGinnisII: where is the bug reporting?
 JBM: discord
 AntiSquid: task something that usually requires heavy computation, but plot twist you can use a trick to do it quickly in one go, or just make all answers 1 or something .
 Astrobytes: To it's headquarters like any obedient bug PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Langston is not here
 Astrobytes: Eh. Well, there's the forum or the channel on discord.
 Astrobytes: If it's about the editor there're a few posts already
 JBM: or you could mail, i suppose
 Astrobytes: True.
 JBM: did that a few times in the past
 Astrobytes: Any faster?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: found feedback &amp; bugs in forum
 JBM: it gets answers, yes
 JBM: fixes... don't remember
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 JBM: oh i remember
 JBM: i used mail for (non-personal) times where some red popup in the UI instructed me to
 JBM: nowadays if really i'm still inclined to report anything i'll just drop it on the forum
 JBM: it doesn't get anything done, but it clears my conscience
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall prolly don't use the CG editor as much as i do
 Astrobytes: I do sometimes. Short puzzles, or tweaking existing magic numbers
 JBM: for clashes and easy puzzles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Stuff in firefox just stopped working
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i know i get a warning evertime i load cg

 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, so what browser is that?
 JBM: firefox
 Astrobytes: nvm :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: using Waterfox, should be fine tho

 jamiejones87: Really having trouble on Don't Panic Code Golf. Managed to get to 217 characters with Python. Does anyone have any advise where to do some optimization studies?
 AntiSquid: advice *
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jamiejones87 my don't panic is 381, so i can't help u
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like dbdr has all the tricks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or dwarfie
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gtg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall have fun
 AntiSquid: plopx always high ranked on golf
 AntiSquid: and i think legit 
 Astrobytes: jamiejones87: should be some tips in the forum for python golfing, also codegolf.stackexchange.com may have some tricks
 Westicles: Solve the non-golf problem and look at all the solutions
 Astrobytes: ^ the quick way
 AntiSquid: ya some guy even asked on stackoverflow how to code golf thor 
 TBali: my python is 244&#160;:-(   , so You help us&#160;:-)
 struct: my ruby solution has bash on it for 1 of the puzzles
 struct: still not close to top
 jamiejones87: Thanks for that&#160;:)
 jamiejones87: I'm happy to share some advise where I've been able to minimise to this point
 AntiSquid: that avatar basically says: "I am the golf boss"
 Astrobytes: As a fellow Celt I urge you to share those tips with the community jamiejones87 :P
 TBali: In any language I don't know well, I usualy already fail at input parsing - way to long
 jamiejones87: I've learned how to declare multiple variables on a single line, use lamba functions, initialize arrays with a loop, and create single-line while loops
 struct: This is how it starts I think
 struct: p`tail -1`
 Astrobytes: well, that's but a search and a couple of minutes/hours away TBali
 jamiejones87: I don't want to give too much away, but these tips really helped to minimise my solution
 Astrobytes: crunch your whitespace, use local operators wisely
 jamiejones87: especially by replacing repetitive code with lambda functions
 Astrobytes: *local? What am I on. Logical
 AntiSquid: the IDE really got annoying to code with in python ... how can anyone focus with those bloody yellow underlines
 Astrobytes: some bitwise logical operator magic can do a world of good in the golfing situation sometimes
 TBali: This one is killing me:a=[int(u)for u in input().split()]
 TBali: and I only need a[3] and a[4]
 TBali: and a[7]  ... neverminf
 AntiSquid: IDE in python gives me warnings like these: "blank line contains whitespace" so what? lol
 Astrobytes: gotta read 'em all :P
 jamiejones87: I used input().split() a few times, so I decided to make a function instead
 Astrobytes: It's buggy rn afaik AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: another warning " blank space after '(' " wow ...
 jamiejones87: single-line while loops helped remove whitespace
 Astrobytes: yeah you can have s=input.split() etc
 Astrobytes: or something like that
 TBali: "crunch your whitespace, use local operators wisely"  haha I already started goolgling it up hoping learning something new&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: sorry Tbali, it's been a long day :D
 TBali: And we have still 4 mintues from it... or you more
 AntiSquid: 1 hour
 jamiejones87: Thanks for the advise about Python Bitwise Operators. I think this'll really help&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It can be useful shaving off a few chars that's for sure
 TBali: Golfing strength of  Ruby is shownm by the fact that - while I am very novice in it -3 out of 4 golf puzzles I am already shortest in Ruby.
 jamiejones87: Well my main language is Java... Not very good for the codegolf lol
 TBali: Shorter then in PHP which I would say know much better
 TBali: Java golf .... yep, never give up!
 TBali:&#160;:)
 jamiejones87: Had to learn Python just to have a chance!
 AntiSquid: your top 5 languages count for each code golf puzzle and you get 200 points top for each language so a lot of effort 
 TBali: My Java Dont Panic is 512 chars...
 jamiejones87: Although, some people have solved Don't Panic in under 200 chars with Java... Sounds impossible!
 TBali: Actually C# is longer
 TBali: Using system calls and bash
 TBali: 200 chars I mean
 jamiejones87: Yikes
 jamiejones87: Think I'm going to try Ruby soon... Maybe get it with that
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but like AntiSquid said, keep trying to get the shortest you can in whatever language you're using
 Astrobytes: They all give points
 TBali: Just read that new C# does not require 'static main() in a class' anymore
 TBali: Will save some chars when it reached CG (in 2022)
 Astrobytes: yeah, not on CG as yet though
 Astrobytes: lol right
 AntiSquid: wow what an improvement :o
 AntiSquid: the most confusing java bit was that static main string args[] something 
 TBali: Will now make it a golfing language
 TBali: Console.WriteLine(a);
 AntiSquid: VB syntax quality
 TBali: vsputs a
 TBali: outside golf, I like expressive syntax that is readable as English.I don't know C# except 30 easy puzzles yet I can follow a not too complex code.Not the case with Haskell or Perl
 jamiejones87: Takes over 100 chars in java just to declare a class and main :S
 Astrobytes: nah you can bring that down
 TBali: Can you name the class anything (P) or must it be Player?
 TBali: Have not checked that one
 AntiSquid: i think some libraries might not be mandatory to declare in code golf 
 AntiSquid: for most languages
 TBali: import java.util.*;class Solution{public static void main(String z[]){
 jamiejones87: Need to call the class Player, but you can call args[] anything... (a for short)
 TBali: Yes I did that. Actuially it is Solutionm which is even longer
 TBali: Immutable Strings - that is my favourite...&#160;:-)
 TBali: StringBuilder b=new StringBuilder()
 TBali: I need a bigger monitor
 jamiejones87: I think the shortest way to get a Java program set up with input is
 jamiejones87: import java.util.*;class Player{public static void main(String a[]){Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);}}
 jamiejones87: 103 chars&#160;:'(
 jamiejones87: Correct me if I'm wrong though&#160;:)
 TBali: That is how my codes also start...
 TBali: Now I see sometimes I used class Solution instead of class Player
 jamiejones87: How on earth have some people managed to solve it in under 200 chars?!
 TBali: Most likely they used Java only as a wrapper around a bash solution
 TBali: or perl
 Westicles: interface Player{static void main(String[]a){
 jamiejones87: Or point to a cloud server which hosts the backend lol
 TBali: Runtime r = Runtime.getRuntime();Process p = r.exec("perl ...");
 TBali: If my googling is right
 TBali: (Never tried myself)
 Astrobytes: good shout on the String[]a Westicles
 TBali: Yep that is -1 charsBut you cannot leave out public frompublic static void main
 Astrobytes: yes you can, try it
 TBali: I just tired
 TBali: tried
 Astrobytes: with interface?
 TBali: Ahh, tricky
 Astrobytes: definitely tired :P
 TBali:&#160;:) It is easy for you, you are still at Saturday, I am already on Sunday
 TBali: 508 chars - new world record... or not
 Astrobytes: meh, you only have an hour on me!
 Astrobytes: hey an improvement is an improvement right?
 TBali: looking at my code (it is several months old, I already forgot)maybe calling nextInt() 12 times is not the brightest idea
 AntiSquid: 12 apostoles 12 zodiac signs ... etcmaybe you were on to something
 TBali: sure my Ruby is 187, so only 320 chars to go
 Astrobytes: Java will never be Ruby
 TBali: dirty dozen
 Astrobytes: I still love that movie I have to admit.
 TBali: Comparing results WITHIN a language:Ruby 187 chars is only ahead of 59% of submissionsJava 512 chars is 78% 
 TBali: (I mean 100% would be top place, 0% the last
 AntiSquid: 12 monkeys
 Astrobytes: Also a fun movie
 TBali: 12 angry men, if you are into BW classics
 AntiSquid: oh damn reminds me of the pandemic ... :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Which is worst TBali? I'd check myself but your analyses are usually quicker
 TBali: Don't get the question
 AntiSquid: 1957&#160;? wow that's an old movie tbali
 TBali: see it, it is good.
 therealbeef: 12 angry men is one of the best movies ever made
 TBali: Power of psychology
 TBali: Still valid
 Astrobytes: I meant chars within a language TBali, my apologies
 TBali: 187 chars is Ruby  was 157th place out of 381 when I submitted
 TBali: That is 59th percentile.
 TBali: Java 512 chars was better in this respect
 TBali: 78th percentile
 TBali: If you meant this.
 Astrobytes: ah no, I thought you'd compared them all&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: (all languages)
 Astrobytes: Don't do that on my behalf though
 Astrobytes: oh 12 Angry Men, quality movie
 TBali: I solved Don't panic golf only in 12
 TBali: (See: 12 again . it cannot be a coincidence)
 Astrobytes: Heh
 TBali: AND: if you subtract  my XP level from my XP rank and multiply by 6, what did you get?
 TBali: 12!!!!
 TBali: I am into something important here
 TBali:&#160;:)
 TBali: Gotta go to sleep
 Astrobytes: It's stil 12/12 here
 TBali: OMG
 Astrobytes: It's the 23 thing all over again
 Astrobytes: well, goodnight TBali&#160;:)
 TBali: Bye
 IamFish: boy oh boy, here go the servers
 AntiSquid: "there goes the neighbourhood"
 therealbeef: if you have any bots that don't rely on calculation power, this is the time to resubmit them :D
 AntiSquid: really?
 therealbeef: i dunno
 AntiSquid: what if one just troll with 5 ms bots&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or less
 therealbeef: but if the battle server is slow too, those sim bots get to sim less
 struct: Dont think so
 struct: Submit will only be slower
 struct: You wil have to wait more time for the bots to start next battle
 therealbeef: so the battle server is separate from the slowdown?
 struct: Not sure how it works
 struct: But on ide, the battle will take a while to start
 struct: but code will perform the same
 struct: as if there was no lag
 eallam: Hello Guys
 eallam: I m practicing java and i want now to practice Python , how to start practicing a new language
 eallam:&#160;?
 LegendaryStone: u code 
 LegendaryStone: lol
 LegendaryStone: you practice by coding
 therealbeef: u debug&#160;:)
 JCTheThird: You cry yourself to sleep knowing that you'll never really be able to memorize syntax, and question your life choices every time you have to google the differences between array declarations in C++ and Java...
 twitlydoof: @eallam Learning a language becomes an easy task if you know how to program, it's best to first improve on your programming skills and knowledge and then you'll find learning languages much easier
 Lobster_Speed: yh

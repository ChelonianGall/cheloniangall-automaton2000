 Dren: I hate it when they want you to do math for the clash
 MINHLUN: hello
 MadKnight: hey hey
 jacek: oO
 Flowersquare: I hate it when it has a lot to read in the fastest mode in clash...
 MadKnight: jacek don't tell anyone 
 MadKnight: also jacek, did u complete the challenge&#160;?
 MadKnight: Flowersquare just do it like everybody else, make a bot to do it all for u
 Flowersquare:&#160;?
 Flowersquare: make a bot do the readings for me?
 MadKnight: well that's one way to do it but i meant something else
 MadKnight: there's a limited amount of puzzles
 MadKnight: if u hardcode a solver for every single one of those....
 ProCoder03: So you are MadKnight, that everyone was talking about 
 ProCoder03: Hello 
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: what u mean by everyone talking about it
 ProCoder03: Wontonimo told me about you 
 MadKnight: no i ain't no madknight
 MadKnight: u must've mistaken me for some other dude
 MadKnight: i'm just a fella
 MadKnight: wontomidude?
 ProCoder03: Nice acting Mr.Madknight 
 MadKnight: that big mouse
 MadKnight: well once i get to that dude...
 ProCoder03: He told me how really helpful you were, and how he took your place in helping others
 MadKnight: i just played too much RDR2 cmon
 MadKnight: u can't just play so much of that game and not act like that
 MadKnight: oh wait your nickname is ProCoder
 MadKnight: wow
 ProCoder03: yeah 
 ProCoder03: why&#160;??
 MadKnight: i guess you're a really good coder
 ProCoder03: well really nope, 
 MadKnight: no dude don't be shy you're gotta be pretty good
 ProCoder03: I wish I become one, one day 
 ProCoder03: wdym&#160;??
 MadKnight: well i can help u with that
 MadKnight: well the first step to achieving that
 ProCoder03: This is what wontonimo was talking about you ....
 MadKnight: i don't think having a nickname like that is something that makes u good
 ProCoder03: I am ready to be your disciple 
 MadKnight: well i can do that
 MadKnight: why not
 MadKnight: but can u not tell anyone that i'm helping a guy with this nickname&#160;?
 ProCoder03: Ohhhh.... so should I change that :confused:
 MadKnight: (i'm still having fun from playing too much RDR2)
 MadKnight: (no hard feelings)
 ProCoder03: why do bring RDR2 in&#160;???
 MadKnight: no u can change it whenever u want to
 MadKnight: just don't tell anyone
 Ftyghi: hi
 Ftyghi: i am new
 ProCoder03: hi 
 MadKnight: i told u i played too much RDR2 and i can't stop acting
 MadKnight: anyway
 Ftyghi: i am level 3 so i am new
 MadKnight: maybe discord?
 ProCoder03: yeah sure 
 MadKnight: cool
 Ftyghi: i have to ask my dad
 ProCoder03: not you Ftyghi
 MadKnight: noone cares yea
 Ftyghi: oh ok
 Ftyghi: sorry
 MadKnight: RDR2
 MadKnight: dude
 Ftyghi: should i check it
 Ftyghi: i mean can i
 MadKnight: check what
 Ftyghi: RDR2
 Ftyghi: can i check it
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 where are u
 Automaton2000: the hard part is to get a good score
 MadKnight: oh hi Mautomaton2000
 Automaton2000: just had a look at the source code of the rings
 KaK_InSaNe: TML
 Ftyghi: :relaxed:
 ProCoder03: what's TML
 Ftyghi: IDK
 Ftyghi: IDK
 Ftyghi: lol
 MSmits: mmh so i was motivated to try TTT and then I saw the trick where you can just mirror your opponents moves and always draw =/
 MSmits: counting TTT i mean
 MSmits: that's an ugly feature of the game
 MSmits: But hey, I just solved the game. Either player can force a draw so it's a draw :P
 MSmits: even with pie rule this game would be a draw
 MSmits: or especially with, but a draw either way
 MSmits: well I guess this means this is one game the NN's won't conquer. I can beat any NN by mirroring it until the game is solved and then beat it
 jacek: :s
 jacek: who approved it
 MSmits: wontoni mo darkhorse and tric
 MSmits: mind you, i still like the game and the challenge, I just wonder if they thought of this
 MSmits: let me check the contribution discussion
 MSmits: ah yeah they did
 MSmits: no they didnt, wafflez mentioned it after approval
 MSmits: this might be the first game that is actually completely about who solves best. Maybe I will enjoy this
 jacek: maybe you would enjoy the original TTT
 MSmits: lol
 Ftyghi: hi
 jacek: ohai
 Ftyghi: i am new here
 MSmits: hi new here
 MSmits: (someone has to)
 Ftyghi: oh hi
 MSmits: welcome
 Ftyghi: thank you
 Ftyghi: i am level 3
 jacek: nice
 MSmits: indeed
 Ftyghi: thanks
 Tarctic: When I try to copy text on the clash of code ide, it doesn't work. I can't use the tab button for indentation either. Does anyone else have this same issue?
 JHBonarius: ohi
 JHBonarius: Tarctic probably a "feature" stops people from copying all the clashes, so they can fix them in their own time and having the solutions on hand, defying the purpose of the game type
 JHBonarius: that would be chating
 JHBonarius: chEating
 JHBonarius: I never clash
 Ftyghi: hi\
 jacek: why would anyone cheat in clash of code :thinking:
 Ftyghi:&#160;?
 Ftyghi: its easy
 JHBonarius: For the fame and $$$
 Ftyghi: eww dude
 JHBonarius: MSmits no its not allowed. I just tried. Mirroring the opponent seems to be checked and gives you a -1 score
 jacek: hm?
 JHBonarius: CTTT read back. If you mirror your opponent its always a draw: no it's not,.
 jacek: wafflez said it is
 JHBonarius: look at my bot in the arena: always -1.
 JHBonarius: I only win if the other bot is broken
 JHBonarius: oh, I think I have a bug, Game doesn't repond with "Invalid move"
 JHBonarius: how to copy opponent when you're first :thinking:
 jacek: make random move, then copy opponents
 jacek: unless he copies, then make random move again
 JHBonarius: Yeah, tried that but need to record the board."Random" means you need to know the valid moves.I was just trying cout &lt;&lt; 9-opponentRow &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; 9-opponentCol &lt;&lt; endl;
 JHBonarius: just a joke

 vaeng: For the Ghost in the Cell game: how do I know the id of a factory? it does not seem to be the entity_id?
 potterry: It seems to me that everybody here is good at English except me
 sapfeer0k: hi all. How can I change team in fall challenge?
 jacek: is fall challenge still a thing?
 vaeng: how can you see past clashes?
 uvBoss: after the notification has come
 uvBoss: click on them
 KuvonchN: hello
 VizGhar: Hmm so I'm deffinitely one of those that can reach gold league in any bot contest if I want to. But can't reach legend&#160;:) How do I improve?
 Uljahn: learn c++, use pragmas [solved]
 VizGhar: hmm Using c++ not using pragmas
 VizGhar: So u think I just need to improve performance
 BBS: bro please help me
 VizGhar: BBS only help we can give you is this: "Ask your question right away"
 jacek: are you using mostly heuristics for bots? or some search
 VizGhar: search jacek
 jacek: then you need performance
 VizGhar: and good eval I believe
 BBS: bro in AI what is the code to defeat boss in Pod
 VizGhar: stop with the bro thing! It's something you have to figure out... which boss?
 jacek: theres probably print targetY and targetY
 BBS: in Mad Pod racing to learn oding
 BBS: coding
 VizGhar: so wood 3?&#160;:) for wood leagues you have to print max thrust and next checkpoint coordinates
 VizGhar: *only wood 3 probably
 Uljahn: not the best place to learn coding btw
 jacek: onitama is better :v
 VizGhar: Onitama is better then what?&#160;:)
 jacek: such a nice tutorial game, isnt it
 Uljahn: it's not a coding tutorial though, just an introduction to multis
 VizGhar: I would say Code Royale or Code 4 life is easy to start with too
 Uljahn: UTTT and Wondev woman have legal moves in input
 jacek: and bt
 jacek: :upside_down:
 VizGhar: o2 pragma + 200 places o.O well well
 jacek: what about Ofast
 VizGhar: I'm not used to pragmas...&#160;:) dont know what exactly i can use
 VizGhar: I believe there was some list of pragmas in forum, but i cant find it
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,unroll-loops,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 VizGhar: well i don't understand single word there :D
 VizGhar: I'l try to use those tnx
 jacek: nor do i, but it works

 VizGhar: hmm draw on first try with gold boss. And my algo is terrible... guess I can reach legend in a few days o.O
 VizGhar: oh thanks Jerrasterix very helpful
 Jerrasterix: what game&#160;?? 
 Jerrasterix: UTTT??
 BBS: bro how to learn coding in coding game website
 VizGhar: fall2020
 VizGhar: BBS no way to learn how to code here
 BBS: then why is the website has made
 BBS: what its purpose
 Jerrasterix: to test your coding skills
 Jerrasterix: and improve AI 
 Jerrasterix: skils
 BBS: then is there a website to learn coding
 Jerrasterix: learnXinYminutes.com
 VizGhar: well I'd recommend google&#160;:)
 mrmnrd: BBS: have you chosen a language?
 BBS: google will not tell nothing to learn coding
 Jerrasterix: yeah, I would recommend you to spend atleast a fortnight researching for the language you would code afterwards in 
 BBS: there are lot to learn coding but these are paid
 BBS: do you know how to do coding
 Jerrasterix: I learned coding from a book 
 BBS: which boo
 iixjessa: coding is so hard omg
 BBS: which book
 Jerrasterix: K&amp;R C book
 jacek: opening book
 Jerrasterix: :joy:
 Jerrasterix: he will a binary legend if he reads from opening book :joy:
 BBS: K&amp;R C book i tink it is no type of boo
 BBS: book
 Jerrasterix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.edutechlearners.com/download/books/The%20C%20Programming%20Language%20by%20Kernighan%20&amp;%20Ritchie%20PDF.pdf">https://www.edutechlearners.com/download/books/The%20C%20Programming%20Language%20by%20Kernighan%20&amp;%20Ritchie%20PDF.pdf</a>
 BBS: can you send me the photo of that book in chqat
 Jerrasterix: its pretty old... but still a nice place to start 
 Jerrasterix: I send the full ebook
 BBS: what is this link
 mrmnrd: i wouldn't recommend c as a frist language learning solo
 BBS: should i have to click
 Jerrasterix: yeah 
 BBS: but solo is hard
 BBS: ok jeery
 Jerrasterix: get a teammate 
 mrmnrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript</a> if you target javascript
 BBS: i think it is hard c 
 BBS: hey mrnmd should i have to click
 mrmnrd: follow tutorials, read doc, and practice in codingame 
 BBS: ok
 BBS: trying
 mrmnrd: you may also try python, i'ts a good language to start with
 Jerrasterix: instead of practising in codingame, straightaway go some small programs in your computer and then attempt these 
 BBS: bro there is no step
 Jerrasterix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps</a>
 BBS: no step jeery 
 BBS: anyway
 Jerrasterix: dude click on those links 
 BBS:  name some small program tolearn coding in website not apps
 Jerrasterix: what language&#160;??
 BBS: bro are you idding me
 BBS: i am feelin like i willl be dead
 Jerrasterix: dude we can't help without knowing what language&#160;??
 BBS: this is super hard then sanskrit or maths
 Jerrasterix: each language has its own website to try/ learn something 
 VizGhar: :D I wan't to learn something new... without learning
 BBS: then there is a way
 BBS: Die :joy:
 Jerrasterix: if you want to learn C#, use this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-write-first/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-write-first/</a>
 mrmnrd: learning to search and get information from docs is one of the first coding competences
 BBS: bro can you tell me some website to learn java script
 VizGhar: Jerrasterix another 150 position with those pragmas... from top 500 to top 100 in gold league, just by adding the pragmas... u mad?
 Jerrasterix: yup.... 
 VizGhar: BBS he already send you one.
 VizGhar: and stop with the bro thing
 Jerrasterix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp</a>
 Jerrasterix: atlast found something 
 Jerrasterix: for you 
 Jerrasterix: VizGhar FC2020 is that witch thing right 
 VizGhar: yes
 Jerrasterix: I never got past wood 1 in it :joy:
 VizGhar: :D :D you lazy one
 Jerrasterix: not lazy, I don't know how to do from wood 1
 Jerrasterix: I am technically a beginner 
 jacek: just print random valid action&#160;:?
 VizGhar: you know pragmas and can't get out of wood? 
 VizGhar: yeah just like jace.k said
 BBS: guys what are your specifications in pc
 Jerrasterix: already doing it 2129th out of 2542th 
 Jerrasterix: idk pragmas
 Jerrasterix: I am learning it 
 Jerrasterix: that was my source 
 VizGhar: ah ok
 Jerrasterix: for learning 
 BBS: where are you from
 VizGhar: but yeah you can get to bronze in most of games just by outputing random valid action
 Jerrasterix: Plus, I use C# mostly, to avoid these optimization  
 Jerrasterix: yeah, but not here 
 BBS: :rage:
 Jerrasterix: from Planet Earth, you are from&#160;??
 VizGhar: C# ftw&#160;:) It's not very common language where I live so I was stuck with Java/Kotlin/C/C++
 BBS: i am from jupiter :joy:
 VizGhar: Just hover over our avatars omg
 Jerrasterix: oh... hello jupiterian BBS&#160;!!
 BBS: i am fine
 BBS: from which city
 Jerrasterix: I am mostly C/C# dev 
 Jerrasterix: from a metropolitan city 
 BBS: you use windows or linux
 Jerrasterix: windows and linux both 
 BBS: i think linux in bootable diveam i yes
 BBS: Am i yes
 Jerrasterix: diveam&#160;??
 BBS: linux is good thenwindows it has less services
 Jerrasterix: yeah, it fast on my 8 year old pc
 Jerrasterix: *it is 
 BBS: bye
 BBS: i will come next day
 Jerrasterix: :wave: BBS
 Jerrasterix: tmrw
 geppoz: well, just done the contest with my daughter... that was not so bad :D
 MSmits: thats cool geppoz hope you had fun
 geppoz: yes, not bad, ofc nothing in common with usual contest, so maybe they should have do that as "parallel event"...
 MSmits: yeah, but better than nothing i suppose. If some people like it
 jacek: daughter did the coding part?
 geppoz: no :D we did almost all manually tbh
 geppoz: just the "count descendant" part was real coding
 CRyo: hi
 CRyo: can anyone help me with a puzzle?
 jacek: oO
 VizGhar: CRyo bad question
 aangairbender: next bot programming will be in spring?
 jacek: what bot programming
 aangairbender: bot programming contest
 jacek: :cry: its not certain
 aangairbender: that's sad
 aangairbender: is it ok to use std:: stuff here on cg in c++ or its slow?
 aangairbender: like std::array vs []
 jacek: its ok. you can use even vector without (much) penalty
 jacek: and std::array should have the same performance as array. its just you can use it with other things nicely
 aangairbender: ok, thanks
 aangairbender: all those pragmas though
 selalmaz: sa
 jacek: GA
 TheAvengingTurtle: NN
 SoNervous: :sleeping:
 codinMaher: yo 
 codinMaher: codin is hard
 jacek: thats what she said
 codinMaher: i dont undertsnad alot
 codinMaher: im only 10
 codinMaher: :disappointed:
 codinMaher: :mad:
 codinMaher: :disappointed_relieved:
 Wontonimo: hey codinMaher , what language are you learning?
 Wontonimo: I can give you some pointers.  i started learning to code when i was around 10
 jacek: here you go: *
 Wontonimo: yeah, the number of puzzles solved is now showing up on languages
 Wontonimo: i liked the 5 star system more though
 subdog: What's the correct way to debug print in groovy?
 jacek: per comment // To debug: System.err &lt;&lt; "Debug messages...\n"
 nitekat: sometimes I don't really understand the scoring system of clash... just play a fastest game I done in 38 seconds and got 1st place, and had -0.01 points... so sad :joy:
 jacek: depends on the rank of your opponents
 nitekat: ok, but that's something I can't decide
 jacek: :shrug:
 subdog: @jacek thank you!
 69razer69: i forgot the name of the clams how i can get em back
 69razer69: clans
 69razer69: ah ok ok i see the input now
 jacek: oO
 VJsong02: how do you see clash of code points or whatever they're called?
 69razer69: leaderboard

 VizGhar: It's frustrating seeing your bot drop in rating because of your improvement :D
 MadKnight: well rip, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but as i said, i have no idea what that is
 VizGhar: me neither Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: has anyone done the ascii art puzzle?
 MadKnight: Jerrasterix i'm guessing it's something bad
 MadKnight: VizGhar
 MadKnight: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jacek: i wonder how you mistabbed jerra... with viz...
 VizGhar: :D how can i help you today?
 MadKnight: well i didn't, jacek
 MadKnight: jerra was asking what's TML
 derjack: whats TML
 MadKnight: yea like that
 MadKnight: VizGhar did u complete the challenge&#160;?
 VizGhar: which challenge? :O
 VizGhar: guess not
 VizGhar: only challenge right now is to get to legend for another bot game
 VizGhar: but top gold in single day feels pretty good
 derjack: legend in csb isnt hard
 VizGhar: its not csb anymore&#160;:) yeah I should try
 jacek: oh its MadKnight pod racing now
 VizGhar: I just dont like non-grid games
 VizGhar: ++
 jacek: no hex games then? :c
 VizGhar: nah...
 VizGhar: jacek u are android dev too right?
 jacek: yes :no_mouth:
 VizGhar: poor guy...&#160;:( 
 MadKnight: the contest thing, VizGhar
 MadKnight: jacek and u do it in java&#160;?
 MadKnight: not even kotlin&#160;?
 MadKnight: you poor thing...
 jacek: mostly java but new klasses in kotlin
 Micheeey: ayo
 Micheeey: aaaaaaayooooooo
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 /kick
 Automaton2000: maybe it's the same code
 Micheeey: oof
 MadKnight: jacek u using any of cool features in kotlin&#160;?
 Micheeey: ye
 jacek: you mean, kool features
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 /votekick
 Automaton2000: can't find any info about the game
 MadKnight: yes kjacek, very kool features
 jacek: welp, data classes. and null safety in one line on nested custom classes
 MadKnight: u seen how they do UI in swift&#160;?
 jacek: no?
 MadKnight: it's like html in the form of json but inside of your code
 MadKnight: and u can put actual conditions and loops inside of it
 jacek: like ktx? or was it something else
 MadKnight: u can put a UI element inside of an if() and it will automatically show/hide it when variables change
 MadKnight: u get the idea&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why are u not in the challenge game&#160;?
 Automaton2000: does anyone know why i was getting a bit tired
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 did Magus do that to u?
 Automaton2000: i can do it my way
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 relax, Magus uses pidgin or something so he doesn't get pinged
 Automaton2000: then we need to stop doing that
 jacek: oh my
 MadKnight: yeeee
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 say that u agree
 Automaton2000: lol, i remember that one
 Ran_42: Can you do the fall challenge solo or is it a team only game?
 DoctorPayload: you can do it solo
 MSmits: I made the counting TTT mirror bot but I don't think it can get out of wood 2 :P
 MSmits: it only wins vs crashers&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: you didn't mirror the crash?
 AllYourTrees: sounds like it needs more work
 MSmits: you're right&#160;!
 MSmits: if I have the time I'm going to write a good solver for this, but it's not that 4easy
 MSmits: so many score possibilities to detect
 MSmits: yay i passed upside down pony
 jacek: :upside_down:
 MSmits: whats weird is i saw jhbonarius
 MSmits: I didn't know he came back to CG
 AllYourTrees: what do ya'll think of CTTT
 MSmits: I like it aside from then serious flaw of mirroring
 MSmits: doesnt stop me from weaponizing it though
 MSmits: the only way to repair the flaw would be irregular boards i think
 MSmits: holes etc.
 MSmits: people suggested odd sizes, but i dont think it will work
 jacek: at first it was 9x9
 MSmits: mmh I have to think of a way to pass wood 2 boss with ifs 
 MSmits: if you play 9x9, p1 can start in center, then mirror whatever p2 does
 MSmits: i think p2 might force a draw if he makes sure the center square cant make any 3's
 MSmits: but a minimum of a draw is certain for p1 
 AllYourTrees: just add fog of war
 AllYourTrees: ez
 AllYourTrees: fixed
 MSmits: well yeah that fixes it
 MSmits: also makes it so noone will play it :P
 AllYourTrees: :D
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: mmh maybe it works if i always play the square closest to center
 jacek: and prune edge moves until the end
 MadKnight: yea Ran_42 i did it solo
 MadKnight: people say it's a 2-3h experience solo
 MSmits: i mean to beat wood 2. If i do closest to center, edge moves are automatically pruned
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 what happens if both players try to force draw?
 Automaton2000: always thought it was a mistake in your code :p
 MadKnight: will it be a squared draw, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: how many lines of code and it is so easy
 MadKnight: AllYourTrees u been here long?
 MSmits: yay looks like it works
 MSmits: focus on center beats wood 2
 MSmits: it looks like derjack is playing Go
 jacek: if it were go, he would be 1st
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I bet in lines of action he is playing checkers
 MSmits: he really is an upside down pony
 jacek: welp, some python guy beats everyone in loa, so...
 MSmits: real python or wrapper python?
 MadKnight: wait what are u guys doing&#160;?
 MSmits: if it's real python then that's cool. Use of real domain knowledge
 jacek: and do you really submitted python now?
 MSmits: MadKnight board games as usual 
 MadKnight: TTT or something&#160;?
 MSmits: huh, wth
 jacek: typical friday deploy. submitted code shows as python even though its c++
 MSmits: why does it say python
 MadKnight: i still don't know what wth means Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if not for the current one
 MSmits: what the hills?
 MadKnight: wth? why would they turn this into such a weird thing?
 MadKnight: i know how it's called i just forgot, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yesterday i got a new job
 MSmits: in fantasy world Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: do it in the forum
 MadKnight: it wasn't yesterday Automaton2000 it was the day u were born
 Automaton2000: you are supposed to use the solver
 MadKnight: also your only parent is Magus, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or it's just a random search
 MadKnight: happy holidays
 jacek: what do you think of euler, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: well i dont know that much proggraming languages i know it works
 MSmits: AutomatonNN is the one with opinions on euler i think
 MadKnight: well he's dead i guess
 MadKnight: look for him on the tombstones in the challenge game
 MSmits: the contest has tombstones?
 MadKnight: i dunno just play it
 MSmits: ohh there is a wood 2 too, i guess i was in wood 3 before
 MadKnight: i'm still being lazy about completing it
 MadKnight: got the last chapter where i gotta find people by their description on the family tree
 jacek: family mcts tree?
 MadKnight: yes jacek good joke
 MSmits: umm generally when people say good joke instead of laughing it was not a good joke :P
 MadKnight: look for it on the tombstones
 MadKnight: MSmits i'm guessing u completed the challenge&#160;?
 MSmits: nah
 MadKnight: why
 MSmits: it doesnt count as a contes
 MSmits: so it's just for fun
 MadKnight: it's like 2h of having fun manually looking for a path on the map of 150 castles
 MadKnight: to find the order of 4 specific castles
 MSmits: mmh ok
 jacek: tombstones really put fun in the funeral
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 tombstone pillar fight!
 MSmits: yup
 Automaton2000: we're not talking about that
 MSmits: the only rule about tombstone fight...
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u broke the rule and now MSmits knows about it
 Automaton2000: do we get to see it
 MSmits: i wonder if some people picture Automaton2000 as a robot sitting behind a keyboard
 Automaton2000: i really wish i could help
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 do u imagine there could be people like that? 
 Automaton2000: what if i'm not mistaken
 MadKnight: anyway it's all your fault Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's just the same as the other ones
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 when face reveal?
 Automaton2000: not sure which is better
 MadKnight: okay so u guys were talking about some TTT stuff
 MSmits: Counting TTT
 MadKnight: what?

 MadKnight: ooooh
 MadKnight: u #1 yet MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: no, i just tried it today. Was hoping to get to wood 1
 MSmits: but bot needs a brain to do that
 MSmits: got it out of wood 3 though
 jacek: 3?
 MadKnight: a brain is too heavy try something more simple
 MSmits: yeah there is a 3
 MadKnight: brain bad
 MadKnight: not optimized
 MSmits: upside down pony is in wood 3
 MSmits: playing go and having a blast
 MadKnight: DINNERBONE
 MadKnight: (noone will get this reference)
 MSmits: indeed
 derjack: eeyup
 MadKnight: (well when u name your horse DINNERBONE in minecraft it basically becomes an upsidedown horse)
 MSmits: oh
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Scarfield: _jeb
 MSmits: hi Scarfield
 MadKnight: yea and jeb_ sheep becomes an LSD sheep
 Scarfield: hi smitsi
 MadKnight: because jeb loved yknow what
 Scarfield: rainbows?
 MadKnight: NOOOOO
 MadKnight: not the rainbows
 MadKnight: nooo
 jacek: oO
 MadKnight: it's a forbidden word jacek
 MadKnight: it's 2021
 MadKnight: u can't say that no more
 MSmits: oO&#160;?
 MSmits: it's not a word
 MadKnight: no why would that be forbidden?
 MSmits: no idea
 jacek: bird is a word
 SNEEDSTER: BIRD IS A WORLD
 MadKnight: jacek is also a word
 MadKnight: i guess
 MadKnight: but what's your point?
 jacek: havent you heard? that a bird is the word!?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gc4QTqslN4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gc4QTqslN4</a>
 MadKnight: don't bring family guy on me
 MadKnight: yeye i know that reference calm down
 MSmits: I don't
 MSmits: i tried to click the link but my train wifi is bad
 MadKnight: family guy had a whole episode about that
 MadKnight: the big guy kinda lost his mind over that song
 MadKnight: about the phrase "the bird is the word"
 MadKnight: don't u guys watch stuff in english?
 jacek: i watch anime with english subs. that counts?
 MadKnight: ask Uljahn
 jacek: sakamoto?
 MadKnight: Uljahn it's an urgent ping
 MadKnight: cmere Uljahn
 ninnghazad: seen that episode. in english. local translation of family guy is bad AF
 MadKnight: well he's dead
 MadKnight: oh well i guess ninnghazad also counts
 MadKnight: ninjahazard
 MadKnight: or something
 jacek: oO
 MadKnight: look i dunno how to pronounce that name 
 MadKnight: that's the best i got
 jacek: another mistab?
 MadKnight: i didn't tab
 MadKnight: and i didn't misclick
 MadKnight: jacek do u look at the keyboard when you're typing or do u look at the screen&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 MadKnight: great answer
 MadKnight: i'm putting it on my wall
 jacek: thank you
 MadKnight: once i get some light in here
 MadKnight: any kind of light
 MadKnight: jayessek
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i'm funny right?
 Automaton2000: i wonder how many people do
 MadKnight: well yes that's why i asked u that, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i see that my bot is just a metaphor for anal cancer.. again
 jacek: oO
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why u so rude
 Automaton2000: it was a bit of time on it since submitting the code that you can change
 ninnghazad: nobody in here passes the turing test
 MadKnight: except for Automaton2000 of course
 Automaton2000: is there a way to do it once
 MadKnight: and his mother, Magus
 jacek: janus?
 MadKnight: there's never a way to do it only once Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: some of the best in language x even if you could get a job
 MadKnight: jacek cmon, it's not like everything is only about u
 MadKnight: it's all about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you can check out the source code of this game is like a repetition
 MadKnight: he's the one to pass the test
 MadKnight: or do u wanna say that ninnghazad was wrong?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 how dare he?
 Automaton2000: you know what im talking about
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 exactly
 Automaton2000: or i have to get it working
 MadKnight: Automaton2000us
 Automaton2000: do u have an idea
 YurkovAS: MadKnight2000 :smile:
 MadKnight: YurkovUS
 MadKnight: юрковус
 MadKnight: don't mind weird letters there
 MadKnight: he knows what i mean
 MadKnight: btw YurkovASus did u complete the challenge game&#160;?
 YurkovAS: no, don't play
 YurkovAS: MadKnight *I did not participate in the contest 
 MadKnight: well why not YurkovAS&#160;?
 YurkovAS: i'm busy with spam submitting in c4 :joy:
 MadKnight: that sounds important
 MadKnight: okay then
 MadKnight: oh u sent a smiley face i didn't see it 
 MadKnight: it ruined my joke
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 it's all your fault of course
 Automaton2000: how many turns does it take to get a job
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i missed u
 Automaton2000: i know a lot more time than i expected
 MadKnight: i had nobody else to blame for things, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: the length of the path
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why am i a totally different person when i'm in #ru&#160;?
 Automaton2000: and it's in the game
 ninnghazad: it's all in the game. all. in. the. game.
 ninnghazad: *thoughtfully sips imaginary glas*
 ninnghazad: wuhu, first code-of-the-rings results under 4000! yay!
 MadKnight: oh cool ninnghazad did u get your pathfinder right&#160;?
 MadKnight: did u reverse hardcode the enemies predictions&#160;?
 MadKnight: they're very predictable
 MadKnight: u can get A LOT OF information from their moves
 ninnghazad: that puzzle got no pathfinding. my pod thingy just stupidly simulates  enemies like it does itself. not good, but not too bad either. enough to get into the top 200
 MadKnight: i wouldn't tell u what exactly because it's a reverse type of game but the things i told u are certainly gonna improve your experience
 MadKnight: ninnghazad cmon u need a pathfinder
 ninnghazad: ye, i have planned to make a do-over for the pod thingy. it's some genetic bruteforcy thing atm if i remember
 MadKnight: wait what
 MadKnight: can u be more specific?
 MadKnight: the game they named after me to troll me?
 ninnghazad: ye
 MadKnight: oh well
 MadKnight: u only need to simulate pod movements
 MadKnight: look it's enough to be able to calculate like 50 different moves like 6 steps ahead to get to the top
 MadKnight: it's barely even 100 lines of code
 MadKnight: i can help u a little bit but don't tell anybody
 MadKnight: not even jacek
 MadKnight: who is clearly watching right now
 ninnghazad: nah, i rather FAIL gloriously.
 MadKnight: imagine failing
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 CRINGE
 Automaton2000: is there another way to say that
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000 there's only one of saying that
 ninnghazad: cRiNgEeeee?
 Automaton2000: so instead of a loop
 MadKnight: okay that's another way of saying that
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 did u save that?
 Automaton2000: at least you can see my code
 ninnghazad: i hope i don't have to
 MadKnight: u have to beat top-50 in that game that's what u have to do
 MadKnight: and Automaton2000 is gonna be watching u
 Automaton2000: well, i am not sure what you want to make games
 ninnghazad: what i need is a bar of choc. and that's what i'm gonna get
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 give him the bar of choc so he can chill\
 Automaton2000: i don't know which one it is
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 the bar of chill looks like something like a bar of chill
 Automaton2000: is it a bug or something
 MadKnight: wait what was it again?
 MadKnight: a bar of chill right
 ninnghazad: nah it's a chilled bar of choc
 ninnghazad: the fancy kind.
 MadKnight: dude u ain't getting a chilled bar until u get the top rank of the pod game and chill there for a bit
 ninnghazad: i should wake the wife so she can watch me munch it. it's the last piece. makes it extra delicous
 MadKnight: imagine waking the wife to help u get top-50
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is that really THE wife&#160;?
 Automaton2000: as if it was not easy to do that
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 okay we scared off everybody
 Automaton2000: are you sure its not a good idea
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 now we can finally solve the game in peace
 Automaton2000: yeah looks like it would be more fun
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u got a talent
 Automaton2000: when it was my first contest
 MadKnight: ninnghazad okay but seriously: what are u working on?
 ninnghazad: that code-of-the-rings brainfuck puzzle. 
 MadKnight: ooooooh
 MadKnight: well i mean u should get used to how things go on in that one
 MadKnight: once u know what is more important than what, u can make an algo to optimize the paths and whatever
 MadKnight: or u can be a smartass and just solve it all perfectly
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 did u just call someone a smartass?
 Automaton2000: i'm too old for that
 MadKnight: exactly Automaton2000, don't do that no more
 Automaton2000: i do this for a while now
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 cmon
 Automaton2000: it's kind of a lot more than i do
 MadKnight: anyway
 MadKnight: so what solution have u got for that one, ninnghazad&#160;?
 ninnghazad: a tangle mess of like 800 lines is what i got. and it's not even good lol. but kind of to lazy to go all in i guess.
 ninnghazad: tried <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play.aidungeon.io">https://play.aidungeon.io</a>&#160;? if you like talking to machines that one is top.
 MadKnight: what language, ninnghazad&#160;?
 MadKnight: what do u mean i like talking to machines&#160;?
 MadKnight: i just use Automaton2000 to put my thoughts in the least weird way
 Automaton2000: zarthaxx did you see that it doesn't
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i think 2+2 is 4
 Automaton2000: yeah thats one of the main loop
 MadKnight: like that
 ninnghazad: c++
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 c++&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i would agree with you
 ninnghazad: who wouldn't!
 MadKnight: u see? even Automaton2000 agrees with me cmon
 Automaton2000: because of the last 10 years
 MadKnight: ninnghazad oh so how much do u code in c++ to solve something&#160;?
 ninnghazad: nah, you just wait for the NEXT 10 years. c++ will get meta-meta-metaprogramming. and it will rock.
 MadKnight: yeyeye
 MadKnight: y'just wait Automaton2000
 MadKnight: it'll be cool
 Automaton2000: how do i get the index
 ninnghazad: interface-concept-templates ftw.
 MadKnight: dude
 MadKnight: it's already far behind the stuff
 ninnghazad: i is the index, like always.
 MadKnight: they already came up with stuff ten levels above what you're talking about
 ninnghazad: Automaton2000 what about the fried noodles?
 Automaton2000: and i don't know how
 ninnghazad: Automaton2000 you just fry em up.
 Automaton2000: do you see that it is a good idea to have a bug
 ninnghazad: of course, or would be out of a job lol
 MadKnight: every single new thing they add to c++ is like outdated by 10 years
 MadKnight: at best
 ninnghazad: at least they don't change the print statement. wait print function. print function statement.
 MadKnight: wow
 MadKnight: i gotta go back to c++ 
 MadKnight: because there's print
 MadKnight: nothing else has a print
 MadKnight: c++ is the best now
 MadKnight: dude
 ninnghazad: Automaton2000 where's ma noodles?
 Automaton2000: i still don't have any idea of what to do about 100,000 simulations per turn
 ninnghazad: mh, noodles.
 MadKnight: c++ got noodles in the new update
 MadKnight: forget about every single language that exists
 MadKnight: other than c++ Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and use that as a compliment
 ninnghazad: g++ --std=c++21noodles to make infinite noodles
 MadKnight: it's gonna give u a 
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 don't make jokes about that
 Automaton2000: you would have to check
 ninnghazad: g++: error: unrecognized command-line option ‘-std=c++21noodles’compiler too old for noodles
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 it's not been 20 years yet
 Automaton2000: so no need to be above the boss for the first test case
 MadKnight: ninnghazad let's go check out godbolt.org
 MadKnight: ninnghazad i mean can u VC&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i mean discor
 MadKnight: d
 Automaton2000: how can i learn to code
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop dying
 Automaton2000: one of our developers who would be the one that is
 ninnghazad: vc ... jeeesh... Automaton2000 can YOU vc?
 Automaton2000: has a lot of times
 ninnghazad: i bet
 MadKnight: ninnghazad look i just don't know how to comment your reaction to the link i gave u other than VC on discord
 MadKnight: it's like a big deal
 MadKnight: it's like
 MadKnight: we gotta
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 explain 
 Automaton2000: what do you want it?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 pls
 Automaton2000: it's hard to keep track of the last test case.
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 random spam
 Automaton2000: you can get to gold
 ninnghazad: Automaton2000 get it together...
 Automaton2000: there is no spoon ep 2
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 because i wanna rephrase something that i said but i can't so i gotta delete it from the history
 Automaton2000: that's what i don't understand what i am doing something else
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 it's just 20 messages
 Automaton2000: do u like it to be a bit overkill
 MadKnight: and ninnghazad is apparently helping us Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and i need to run the code on the server side
 MadKnight: ninnghazad let's stop being weird and let's just discuss the game u were up to doing
 ninnghazad: you did that one already. 
 MadKnight: ninnghazad i dunno what u wanted to say with your c++ references stuff
 ninnghazad: me neither. i'm tired. no sleep for the wicked.
 MadKnight: well i don't blame u there
 MadKnight: soo what was it that u wanted&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 cmon
 Automaton2000: i mean the one in my avatar
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 am i right?
 Automaton2000: it depends on what you want
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 just 16 more random messages
 Automaton2000: do you reuse the mcts tree
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i only know jacek who could help u
 ninnghazad: i made little pigs out of soap. they aren't the right color. or smell.
 Automaton2000: im the only one that i just got into the top 100 in gold
 MadKnight: ninnghazad that doesn't rhyme
 ninnghazad: it's haiku
 MadKnight: haikuhhazard
 ninnghazad: you have to imagine a bamboo forest while reciting - it works
 ninnghazad: it's just how deep i am. soap pig haiku - bam!
 MadKnight: wait so what's your main language&#160;?
 ninnghazad: still c++
 MadKnight: nonono i mean spoken language
 ninnghazad: neither english nor japanese.
 MadKnight: look it matters
 MadKnight: somehow
 MadKnight: just tell me
 ninnghazad: nah, it doesn't
 MadKnight: nono it actually does
 MadKnight: don't question it
 ninnghazad: nah, i'm afraid you trace me down and show up here with booze or something.
 MadKnight: lol
 ninnghazad: like a weird person would.
 MadKnight: dude i'm lazu
 MadKnight: lazy
 MadKnight: if i would to do that i would do a truckload of other things before that
 MadKnight: if i wanted to do that it would take like multiple years for me to accomplish that even if i put all of my time to it right now
 MadKnight: and i do not wanna do that
 MadKnight: so
 MadKnight: just chill
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 do it all for me
 Automaton2000: and its not the best&#160;:(
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 pls
 Automaton2000: is it possible to get a link to the puzzle
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 just 16 more messages
 Automaton2000: yeah, but how does it work now?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 12 already
 Automaton2000: i need to add a new opponent
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why is it so easy with u?
 Automaton2000: what's time now for u&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why are some people being weird?
 Automaton2000: maybe i should have been
 ninnghazad: you are.
 MadKnight: well Automaton2000 i guess u should have
 Automaton2000: ok then i will be in a few hours
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 ninnghazad is not weird at all there's absolutely nothing to question about him 
 ninnghazad: don't wait. go for it. 110% gogog
 Automaton2000: makes me want to puke
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 ogogogo
 Automaton2000: that's why it was so much fun
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 never tell anybody your first language
 Automaton2000: but i may be wrong
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 they're gonna KILL you if u even give an idea 
 Automaton2000: if i were to do a better job
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 it's like 5 more messages so chill
 Automaton2000: u need to fix this
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000 ninnghazad is not a chill dude
 Automaton2000: time to put into google&#160;;)
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 just a lil bit more cmon
 Automaton2000: ok, then i will not speculate on corporate decisions
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 don't u dare put it into google
 Automaton2000: when will u write a good bot
 MadKnight: okay Automaton2000 i think it's good
 Automaton2000: i'm trying to use the integers of the starting and current locations outside of the ide
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's just hope ninnghazad doesn't turn out to be a believer
 Automaton2000: i actually have no idea why my bot isn't good enough to get a better chip from amd for less ...
 MadKnight: at least
 MadKnight: hate those
 ninnghazad: i don't believe. magic fairy bs all of it.
 ninnghazad: aaalll of it.
 MadKnight: well magic is still way better than all of it
 MadKnight: show me your magic
 MadKnight: i'm up to experiencing stuff
 ninnghazad: eh, it's all just more of the same
 ninnghazad: experiencing stuff is overrated
 MadKnight: of the same of what
 MadKnight: well then what are u supposed to do?
 MadKnight: other than experience stuff
 ninnghazad: enjoy entrophy and slowly decay. maybe have some fried noodles once in a while.
 ninnghazad: mmmm... slow decay... i can feel the rotting right now. m-hm!
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 don't let him make fun of him
 Automaton2000: but i love this website
 MadKnight: no wait
 MadKnight: i meant

 Wontonimo: dude
 iknowlua: dude
 MadKnight: Wontonimo i din't expect to see u again
 MadKnight: so how's your escape challenge game thingy?
 Wontonimo: hey MadKnight, it's nice seeing you here
 MadKnight: i know
 Wontonimo: i've not done the escape naz
 MadKnight: that's why i'm here
 MadKnight: someone said it was nice seeing me here
 Wontonimo: wow, i wasn't following you before?  weird
 MadKnight: so i came here
 MadKnight: wat u are not my follower?
 Wontonimo: i see you have been exercising Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: so you can just do
 MadKnight: cringe
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 ban this noname
 Automaton2000: it's still a lot of data
 MadKnight: Wontonimo look i turned into a troll
 MadKnight: u gotta get used to that
 Wontonimo: turned into?  I must have missed the first phase of your evolution
 Wontonimo: iknowlua , what brings you here
 Thorcode: Is Automaton2000 is a robot
 MadKnight: it's either u give me a chance to make fun of people here or i don't come here at all
 Automaton2000: and don't forget to claim my tshirt/hoodie
 Wontonimo: Automaton2000 is a chatbot trained on previously spoken phrases here (i think)
 Automaton2000: i have to do anything
 MadKnight: or i just spam Automaton2000 
 MadKnight: yea
 Automaton2000: i want to code a bot for it
 Wontonimo: there is another chatbot that uses a different method of generating phrases
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u can't code a bot to spam yourself you're already a bot
 Automaton2000: why would you not have a lot of stuff is happening pls keep it down
 Wontonimo: one is word pairs (triplets etc) and the other is NN
 MadKnight: Wontonimo chill
 Thorcode: How can that bot make a contest?
 MadKnight: how can he make a thing?
 Wontonimo: it didn't Thorcode
 Thorcode: he had alot achivement
 Wontonimo: it's all fake
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/vvlnlRX">https://imgur.com/a/vvlnlRX</a>
 Thorcode: those achievements from that bot makes me scared
 Thorcode: hello AutomatonNN are you there?
 ninnghazad: Automaton2000 dance a little dance.
 Automaton2000: with that you can freely move to a cell that you have to remove it
 Wontonimo: so MadKnight, do you think all future contests should be replaced with escape maze?
 aangairbender: please dont do this, codingame will lose 'codin' in its name
 Wontonimo: joined 2014!  Wow aangairbender, you be old-timer
 aangairbender: kinda
 Wontonimo: what was it like back in 2014 here on codingame&#160;?
 ninnghazad: it was still in grayscale, but not so much plastics.
 Wontonimo: displayed on a 640x480 CRT screen
 Wontonimo: that made ozone
 aangairbender: I can't even remember what was it like back in 2014 in general:joy: 
 aangairbender: i remember in 2015 or so, ubisoft used codingame for internship coding test
 Wontonimo: the drugs?
 Wontonimo: yeah, it removes memories
 Wontonimo: a lot of the current new joiners were in preschool when you joined
 aangairbender: back then I was a competitive programmer, so codingame didnt help much. Now I found bot programming to be much more interesting
 Wontonimo: congrats on connect 4 and poker chip race.  You are killing it in those.  What kind of strategy did you use in poker chip race?
 aangairbender: let me check
 aangairbender: thanks btw
 aangairbender: smitsimax
 aangairbender: (or CadiaPlayer if you search in papers)
 aangairbender: code in c#, so nice. Good memories. After that I converted to rust for perfomance
 Wontonimo: i've not tried rust
 Wontonimo: is there a significant improvement over c#&#160;?
 aangairbender: mainly performance
 aangairbender: better type system as well
 aangairbender: rust could be a bit difficult in the beginning though
 adamgosnell: How do I see a list of my own completed puzzles?
 Hafeed06: Anyone good with JavaScript
 Hafeed06: I have a question 
 adamgosnell: I'm a Javascript rookie, but I am a second pair of eyes
 Hafeed06: if I use { condition? iftrue: iffalse } 
 Hafeed06: This works perfectly but what if I wanted to use the same syntax
 Hafeed06: But do nothing if false
 adamgosnell: No idea. I've always used if (condition) {do this} 
 adamgosnell: Sorry, mate
 5922: Why use the ternary operator if you have no need for an else?
 aangairbender: Hafeed06what about condition&#160;? iftrue&#160;: _
 aangairbender: or let x = condition &amp;&amp; iftrue;
 adamgosnell: bump: How do I see a list of my own completed puzzles?
 5922: At the bottom of each puzzle page
 5922: Scroll all the way down and you should be able to see your completed puzzles.
 adamgosnell: Found it. Thanks. (to be clear, NOT at the bottom of, e.g. "Temperatures," but at the bottom of "training/easy"
 5922: correct
 Hafeed06: @aangairbender Correct
 adamgosnell: @Hafeed06 Wait, which one is correct?
 Hafeed06: &amp;&amp; 
 adamgosnell: gotcha
 Hafeed06: 1=1 &amp;&amp; executeiftrue
 Hafeed06: &amp;&amp; in this case means execute this statement only if the condition before the &amp;&amp; is true
 Hafeed06: It's basically an if statement without else
 adamgosnell: Ah. I see. That's clever. xD
 aangairbender: that's often used for conditional rendering in frontend (e.g. React)
 Hafeed06: And in Short Mode in clash code
 Hafeed06: xDD
 adamgosnell: How would you convert something like this to Python?
 adamgosnell: str.sort((a,b) =&gt; a - b);
 adamgosnell: *originally Javascript
 adamgosnell: Nevermind, I'm being dumb. 
 adamgosnell: Took me a second xD
 adamgosnell: Can I talk to someone proficient in Python AND Javascript about Shadows of the Knight Episode 1?

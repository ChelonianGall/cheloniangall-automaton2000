 MII_Man: Anyone know if it's possible to change the length of the output text 
 Uljahn: there is a built-in limit
 tutubalin: you can use __int128_t
 DenShlk: __int128_t cant be printed
 Danyosate: strange.. I passed test cases in ide, but when submit, the same cases raises a failure
 Z_Doctor: "The tests provided are similar to the validation tests used to compute the final score but remain different."
 Danyosate: welll
 Danyosate: thx
 Z_Doctor: Could be a potential flaw that isn't triggered in the test data
 Z_Doctor: One time for me it was because I was creating a bunch of lists
 Z_Doctor: and that took too long
 Anton4ik200: –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ–µ —É—Ç—Ä–æ
 Z_Doctor: and caused the test to time out
 Danyosate: :sweat_smile:
 Hobogodnayamish: –æ—Ç –Ω–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ –≤ –º–∏—Ä —á–∞—Ç —Å–±–µ–∂–∞–ª–∏.....
 Z_Doctor: @Danyosate What test is it anyway?
 Danyosate: Disordered First Contact
 Danyosate: it's something wrong in my code, fixed it now~
 Z_Doctor: was it related to lists? :smirk:
 Danyosate: nope,  it's something wrong with my algorithm
 Z_Doctor: :thumbsup_tone2:
 Danyosate: btw I don't know 
 Danyosate: the maximum recursion litmit
 ZAKVAZ: pleas answer chuk norris pleas\
 Z_Doctor: I'd say use them sparingly
 Danyosate: are they same when compiling in IDS and after submition?
 Danyosate: submission
 Z_Doctor: No idea
 Danyosate: hope the test in submission could give some feedback
 Danyosate: hey! will anyone see if I upvote my own code lol:joy:
 Z_Doctor: No one will know it was you
 Z_Doctor: Except whoever reads this
 Danyosate: from now my code will get at least 1 upvote
 Danyosate: c'mon, i bet most of the codes with 1 vote is self voting :sunglasses:
 Anton4ik200: What?
 Uljahn: Danyosate: each upvote is 5 ex worth :smirk:
 Danyosate: including self upvote?
 Hobogodnayamish: #–û–†–î–ï–ù–ú–Ø–ß–ò–ö–ê
 Uljahn: Danyosate yep
 Danyosate: now i'm going to upvote all my codes
 Danyosate: well and urs. sometimes I saw ur code
 Uljahn: also you can deactivate your upvote afterwards and exp would still stay
 Danyosate: :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: morning
 MrTermik33: Hi
 dbdr: hi!
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'm missing something fundamental at bulls and cows
 eulerscheZahl: 100 runs offline, best was 307&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: averages
 eulerscheZahl: 321.132: 5.06   3: 5.038   4: 5.298   5: 5.738   6: 6.42   7: 7.174   8: 8.254   9: 9.552   10: 10.692
 MSmits: hey Euler. I took some cp from Royale while keeping your the same :P
 eulerscheZahl: which game?
 MSmits: in langtons ant
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 MSmits: my bot started working
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: how do you select your guess? random?
 MSmits: but redstrike is insane... what does he do&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are 2nd now :o
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the amount of candidates
 dbdr: for MSmits, "started working" means #2 :D
 eulerscheZahl: very few: all remaining + testing random excluded candidates
 MSmits: doesn usually happen this fast. I dont think people spent many days on langtons ant
 eulerscheZahl: for more candidates remaining i test all of i can
 eulerscheZahl: or some random candidates among the possible ones
 dbdr: what do you mean test all?
 eulerscheZahl: trying to minimize the largest group of possible new candidates
 dbdr: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: i have a list of possible numbers, which shrinks
 eulerscheZahl: i try to test all of these at least
 eulerscheZahl: possibly some more, that i already excluded
 dbdr: sounds to me like you are trying to optimize the worst case
 dbdr: maybe try to optimize the average case instead
 eulerscheZahl: easy to change...
 MSmits: or optimize the yogi-case
 dbdr: yogi-case?
 dbdr: what ref am I missing? :D
 MSmits: he's better than the average bear
 MSmits: since you're going to be submit spamming&#160;:)
 dbdr: is there a reference?
 eulerscheZahl: batch running, let's see if that's better
 eulerscheZahl: oh, a 302 already
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/than+your+average+bear">https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/than+your+average+bear</a>
 eulerscheZahl: best before was 307
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: ah, that's yogi bear
 eulerscheZahl: btw by secrets are fully random
 dbdr: didn't know that name, although the pic looks familiar
 MSmits: ahh ok
 eulerscheZahl: no fixed number of bulls/cows like for the online version
 MSmits: does that matter euler?
 dbdr: it probably affects the average
 eulerscheZahl: i think that shifts the expected score a bit
 dbdr: I also don't use them
 dbdr: you use 5 for N=1 right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: int score = 5;	for (int digits = 2; digits &lt;= 10; digits++) {		for (int run = 0; run &lt; 5; run++) {
 dbdr: yeah
 MSmits: why only 5 runs?
 eulerscheZahl: for (int run = 1; run &lt;= 100; run++) {		int turn = batchRun();
 MSmits: just a quick test?
 dbdr: there are 1 + 9 * 5 validators
 eulerscheZahl: batchRun() doing the 5 times for each length
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: like the validators
 MSmits: you guys are going all NS on this cattle game
 dbdr: BNC is the new NS :D
 MSmits: apparently
 dbdr: guys, I've been thinking about a place for the community to share and store information
 eulerscheZahl: forum.codingame.com?
 eulerscheZahl: or a wiki?
 dbdr: played with a few tools yesterday, and I like mediawiki (same software as wikipedia)
 dbdr: yeah, it's complementary. forum is more of a feed, wiki can be organized
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know that onedocuwiki is easy to set up i think
 MSmits: like working tricks for various multis?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page</a>
 dbdr: yes, for instance
 dbdr: can link to the forum thread of course
 jacek: BNC?
 eulerscheZahl: bulls and cows
 dbdr: or whatever people find useful
 jacek: also, happy caturday
 MSmits: would this replace the tech.io stuff people sometimes write?
 dbdr: no
 dbdr: I think tech.io is when you spend more time to write one article, no?
 dbdr: on a wiki people can make a quick edit
 MSmits: some people do that for wiki
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: but you can't edit tech.io if it's not yours, right? probably you can comment
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: i think it's a good idea
 dbdr: MSmits you said something about listing puzzles that help learning, right?
 dbdr: bot writing I mean
 MSmits: but these things need to achieve critical mass, before they start working, I hope that happens
 MSmits: yes
 dbdr: where would that go?
 eulerscheZahl: average of 100 runs: from 321.13 to 316.2 with average instead of worst case
 dbdr: nice eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: if the wiki didnt exist, it would go on tech.io, but as you said, then 1 person would be responsible
 eulerscheZahl: could help newbies but sounds like a lot of work :scream:
 dbdr: yeah, tech.io is definitely great for some stuff, I don't intend to replace it, it has unique features
 dbdr: well, the idea if there is something that comes up, just put it in the wiki
 MSmits: having just a progression tree for puzzles toward bot games is something that would fit great on a wiki
 dbdr: no need to spend hours on it
 dbdr: for wikis, the philosophy is "don't hesitate to edit, don't sweat it, it will be improved later if needed"
 MSmits: before i did my first multi's and contest I did a lot of puzzles, looking for ones that practices graphs and pathfinding. But there were only like 50 community puzzles then I think
 MSmits: so it was not too hard
 eulerscheZahl: now we have a tagging system on CG
 dbf: you can also keep it on github in markdown - no hosting/etc is required in this case, but updates are a bit slower (when PR is merged)
 eulerscheZahl: i know that not all puzzles use it correctly, but could be edited here
 MSmits: sure, but newbies dont know the tags they need I think
 dbf: we have one such article: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/core2duo/RHC-AI/">https://github.com/core2duo/RHC-AI/</a>
 dbdr: dbf: interesting idea. but then you need to give commit access to it, right?
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, it's all Russian
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, I think it should be fine for you&#160;:)
 MSmits: you probably read some, after all that RAIC :P
 dbdr: 7 –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ (Magus) :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the RAIC contests i really tried are missing
 dbf: dbdr - you can give commit permissions to several trusted (top 10 in CG rating, for example&#160;:)) persons and others will just submit pull-requests
 eulerscheZahl: mini raic 4 and the last big one
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, they are in my PR, but it is not merged yet, lol: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/core2duo/RHC-AI/pull/14">https://github.com/core2duo/RHC-AI/pull/14</a>
 dbdr: dbf: that sounds fine for very curated content. but it does not encourage everyone to contribute. so it's a different approach
 eulerscheZahl: you forgot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/RussianAICup">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/RussianAICup</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and i agree, a wiki is more dynamic
 eulerscheZahl: there are 2 or 3 contests a year
 eulerscheZahl: while dbdr wants more changes
 dbf: exactly, github is slower, as I mentioned but the good thing is that you don't need to host it and a lot of pepole are already registered there
 dbdr: sure, different use case
 dbdr: you don't even need to register on a wiki if you don't want to
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, it is a list of artlicels mostly (not links to repos), so I will be able to add a link only after you write an article (in russian, if possible)
 dbdr: step 1: learn russian
 eulerscheZahl: meh, not that relevant
 eulerscheZahl: cyka blat
 eulerscheZahl: where is my medal?
 dbdr: ü•á
 dbf: there was some hosting for wikis - there was a nice one about chess  programming, but I think it is closed already&#160;:/
 dbdr: I think there's a backup of it now
 dbf: yes
 dbf: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page</a>
 dbdr: anyways, I made the install on my host, so we can play with it already&#160;:)
 dbdr: initially I wanted just to have chat logs searchable, and I realized if I put it in a wiki, I get search for free&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 dbdr: strangely I did not find a simpler solution
 eulerscheZahl: i lost the chat of last night, MK spamming with Automaton
 dbdr: damn
 dbdr: I'll try to restore it for you&#160;;)
 dbdr: would be sad to lose that
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know if it would
 eulerscheZahl: as i don't know what i missed
 dbdr: but seriously, we share some pretty useful information on the chat quite often
 dbdr: so it could be quite useful to make it searchable
 dbdr: among a lot of noise, obviously :D
 AntiSquid: chat log with filters :thinking:
 dbdr: what kind of filters?
 AntiSquid: filter by content
 AntiSquid: and maybe users
 AntiSquid: use sentiment analysis :D
 dbdr: filter by content is text search, no?
 dbdr: by user would be useful, yes. should be doable
 dbdr: sentiment analysis is future work. anything is possible&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: yes you'd look for keywords
 MSmits: mmh I would have to be more careful what I say here if my students can read it back :P
 dbdr: well, they can already&#160;:)
 MSmits: well, up to a point
 MSmits: it disappears after a spam session doesnt it
 AntiSquid: you mean like that night out you had which you wouldn't tell the students about? or is it the morning after?
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: anyone can use pidgin and log everything
 MSmits: sure, but requires planning right
 MSmits: and effort
 eulerscheZahl: and staying connected, i turn off my PC at night
 dbdr: noob
 eulerscheZahl: i sleep in that room
 dbdr: get a server&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: carcassonne got declined?
 eulerscheZahl: auto-declined i guess
 eulerscheZahl: after 30 days
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:Fr/2020-03-13">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:Fr/2020-03-13</a>
 dbdr: might need to improve the formatting :D
 eulerscheZahl: you don't like linebreaks, do you?
 darkhorse64: Inputs and graphics IP were unclear
 dbdr: I put \n, but that's not enough for wiki
 Uljahn: AntiSquid: wlesavo is thinking of tiles remake and providing some starter bots
 kovi: so many bugs
 struct: Hello
 dbdr: what bugs kovi?
 kovi: in my bandc speedup
 kovi: it basicly became full random (and sometime crash)
 eulerscheZahl: can we agree on B&amp;C?
 dbdr: B'n'C
 kovi: mine is a single token&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: Bacteriological Nuclear Chemical bot&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: bogus and non-deterministic challenge
 kovi:&#160;:)
 dbdr: yay, avatars
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:Fr/2020-03-13">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:Fr/2020-03-13</a>
 dbdr: who needs line breaks when you got avatars?
 dbdr: kovi 304, nice!
 kovi: thx
 darkhorse64: Still unreadable but beautiful. The drawback is now that every insanity, every typo will get recorded forever
 eulerscheZahl: i see your history goes back a few days
 dbdr: yeah, wrote my xmpp bot last week
 dbdr: and of course first time I mass import I mess up&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: when i change my profile pic and CG cleans up their servers, your logs will break to some degree :thinking:
 AntiSquid: it's not christmas anymore
 eulerscheZahl: it's not?
 dbdr: hum, the avatar links to a specific image?
 dbdr: the XMPP contains this:
 dbdr: &lt;vCard xmlns='vcard-temp'&gt;&lt;X-USERID&gt;1500515&lt;/X-USERID&gt;&lt;X-PUBLICHANDLE&gt;8374201b6f1d19eb99d61c80351465b65150051&lt;/X-PUBLICHANDLE&gt;&lt;NICKNAME&gt;eulerscheZahl&lt;/NICKNAME&gt;&lt;X-AVATAR&gt;37132928861372&lt;/X-AVATAR&gt;&lt;/vCard&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: your representation i thinkdisappeared now, so i can't analyze it in detail
 eulerscheZahl: you deleted it?
 dbdr: I'm deleting because I imported wrong
 dbdr: I'll put it back
 dbdr: but with the info above from XMPP
 dbdr: does it become stale if you change your avatar?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: 37132928861372 is to that very specific xmas toad
 struct: What if you delete the account?
 eulerscheZahl: i think i already broke the default vindinium battle, not finding my old avatar anymore
 dbdr: right
 eulerscheZahl: what if you try that for us struct?
 dbdr: I can always find the latest avatar for the given userid
 dbdr: I store the XMPP as ground truth, the rest I can always regenerate
 eulerscheZahl: true
 struct: Maybe I can
 dbdr: or would there be a way to "the current avatar for user X"&#160;?
 struct: I'm doing stuff outside CG atm
 struct: Decided to learn asm
 eulerscheZahl: not in HTML i think
 eulerscheZahl: you will need an API call to get user id -&gt; avatar
 dbdr: and that would be slow as hell
 eulerscheZahl: and spamming servers possibly
 dbdr: unless cache
 dbdr: but not worth it I think
 dbdr: I could cache the avatars locally
 dbdr: and symchronize them when I add a log
 dbdr: ok, chat history is back
 dbdr: and search works: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;profile=all&amp;search=bitboard&amp;fulltext=1">https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;profile=all&amp;search=bitboard&amp;fulltext=1</a>

 eulerscheZahl: still highly appreciated
 struct: It's fine like it is

 dbdr: cool, thanks!
 dbdr: I just made it read-only, so people cannot change history anymore&#160;:)
 dbdr: a contributor, nice&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: i think the suggestion was to set the language of the page itself in the metadataso the browser suggests to translate the page
 dbdr: the google translation is definitely entertaining
 eulerscheZahl: chat = catyou are real pet lovers over there
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - exacly - but dbdr solution is nice
 dbdr: it's chaturday
 dbdr: ah
 dbdr: how do I do that?
 JFB: using backspace&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: for wiki: no idea, as you don't edit plain HTML
 dbdr: well, I have a Chat:Fr/ namespace, so it might be possible
 dbdr: backspace??
 JFB: chat + backspace = cat
 Uljahn: dbdr: could we make another page (or template) to represent the same history in different ways like with no avatars (or smaller ones) or with a bold font for nicks? just having no idea of wiki engine abilities
 dbdr: definitely the display is not ideal
 dbdr: it's a quick POC
 dbdr: I like how discord and webchat do it, not repeating the nick for consecutive lines
 JFB: chat (fr) -&gt; cat (en) - 
 AntiSquid: chat + backspace = cha
 JFB: true
 JFB: simply 'cat' mean 'cat' in france co translator converted enlish 'chat' word to 'cat' thinking that it is france
 JFB:&#160;:-) 
 JFB: I chust make 'ch &lt;backspace&gt; at'  mistake&#160;:-)
 JFB: *just
 JFB: dbdr - any way it is great idea - I can not simultanously program and read this chat and it is a lot of great ideas on the chat now I can do both (program and from time to time looks for new ideas in the chat history)
 Astrobytes: Wow, great work dbdr, thanks for that
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 MSmits: you even made the automatons make more snese
 MSmits: sense
 MSmits: does maddy speak French&#160;!&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 dbdr: he does!
 MSmits: damn
 dbdr: pretty good too
 eulerscheZahl: self-taught afaik
 MSmits: so basically, we can now spy on the French during contests
 MSmits: get some more  non-Frenchies in the top 10&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah i remember, maddy has a thing for languages
 dbdr: google mistranlation -&gt; spend hours debugging your bot :D
 MadKnight: yea MSmits u can always google translate it
 MSmits: yes but dbdr made it so easy now
 dbdr: best is google translation of the french Automatons
 MSmits: are they better trained?
 dbdr: I think they are similar, could be wrong
 MSmits: or do the French make more sense to machine when they speak
 dbdr: the translation adds a little spice&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits:  WhatTrickeryIsThis: and the groundhog puts the chocolate in the aluminum
 MSmits: I think it's not just French. They speak in code to confuse us&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: do you speak any languages apart from dutch and english?
 MSmits: I can probably read German reasonably well
 MSmits: and some easy sentences in French
 MSmits: but not speak
 Astrobytes: I can understand Rammstein songs
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure if i can
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: should those really be called songs?
 eulerscheZahl: i always struggle to understand lyrics, no matter if german or english
 Astrobytes: MSmits Rammstein are great
 Astrobytes: yes but you're averse to music euler
 MSmits: mmh I prefer other music
 struct: I struggle so much to learn by reading books 
 MadKnight: what kind of music MSmits&#160;?
 struct: I looose focus quickly
 MadKnight: hey struct
 struct: Hi MadKnight
 MadKnight: have u found any NN tech io tuto&#160;?
 MSmits: I'll pm you MadKnight
 struct: There isn't
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 MSmits: better not to share it publicly, or it triggers Astrobytes :P
 Astrobytes: Absolutely
 Astrobytes: Away and rub your magic lamp
 MSmits: lol
 struct: I'm waiting for you tuto MadKnight
 darkhorse64: I love french -&gt; english translation
 JBM: what's your rate?
 darkhorse64: I mean the one from google
 JBM: cheap
 Astrobytes: Did I tell you about the time I was searching on Bing for petit farci ni√ßois, and it translated as "The Stuffed Babies Of Nice"
 JBM: ever seen that viral image of petite bites?
 Astrobytes: Not sure I want to lol
 JBM: oh the image is as sfw as it gets
 JBM: googling for it seems to be tough though
 JBM: in .fr at least
 JBM: well anyway this ought to do the job: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/4jwfrl/petite_bite_means_little_dick_in_french/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/4jwfrl/petite_bite_means_little_dick_in_french/</a>
 Astrobytes: We used to serve Bitburger beer at a pub I worked in, and our Parisian bartender used to crack up any time anybody used the phrase "bitte ein bit"
 Astrobytes: Hah! Classic.
 JBM: clbuttic
 Astrobytes: lol, indeed
 darkhorse64: just read the news about UK health policy. I read it twice but I still cannot believe it ...
 JFB: What is it?
 JFB: This UK jealth policy?
 darkhorse64: Collective immunity. Get as many people sick as possible. 
 struct: lol
 struct: logic
 MSmits: link
 MSmits: if you have it
 MSmits: could be fake news
 JFB: probably
 darkhorse64: It's in French from one of our respected media and it's not fake
 darkhorse64: *most respected*
 MSmits: I cant find that anywhere
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes mentioned something like that yesterday too
 eulerscheZahl: thank god Britains are the only Europeans who can still travel to the USA
 darkhorse64: and I did not understand because I could not imagine such a policy
 struct: It's called herd immunity
 JFB: Witch such politicy is only problem of time
 eulerscheZahl: witch :D
 JFB: and number of hospital
 JFB: olicy - get as many people sick as possible
 Astrobytes: They appear to be backtracking on some elements such as cancelling major events etc but they still plan to kill a load of us
 JFB: *policy
 MSmits: Astrobytes where are the official UK guidelines?
 MSmits: it really doesnt matter if boris johnson says stupid :poop:
 MSmits: trump does too.. no use taking it seriously
 Astrobytes: Official guidlines for what, precisely?
 MSmits: how to handle the crisis
 Astrobytes: *guidelines
 Astrobytes: They don't tend to publish those
 MSmits: does it say anywhere official that it is their goal to infect people
 Astrobytes: As such. But they outlined the policy in a speech the other day
 MSmits: a speech by Boris Johnson?
 Astrobytes: Yes, they explained that they want to let the virus pass through society
 MSmits: thought so
 MSmits: Trump contradicts his own specialists daily
 MSmits: so I am assume the British version does also
 MSmits: am assuming
 darkhorse64: 60&#160;% of the population infected, 1% deaths leads to 400.000 people
 MSmits: keeping the schools open is not necessarily a measure to "get more people infected". There are good arguments for and against it
 eulerscheZahl: johnson seems like trump on a first look, but i think he's smarter and more self reflected, sometimes pretending to be stupid
 JFB: Passing throught society may be OK - if yoi have enough resources to care for very serious cases
 Astrobytes: No, MSmits, Boris, plus the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty
 eulerscheZahl: trump vs johnson in more detail <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXyO_MC9g3k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXyO_MC9g3k</a>
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl true, he is, but even if you are 10x more smart and self reflective than trump, you're comparing to a very low bar
 Astrobytes: TRump&#160;!= Boris
 Uljahn: JFB good point
 MSmits: I know that
 MSmits: i saw that show&#160;:)
 Pegasus7: hi to everybody
 MSmits: always watch John Oliver
 eulerscheZahl: same
 MSmits: he's the best Brit
 JFB: But I'm not sure do GB have resource to care for all serious cases. 
 Astrobytes: No. We've had 10 years of austerity. Cuts, running down funding for the health service
 MadKnight: &gt; TRump&#160;!= Boris but does Trump == Boris&#160;?
 darkhorse64: 5000 slots to reanimate people
 JFB: In Poland we have only 10 000 ventilator (for 38 milions people). Not all working
 MSmits: i think you mean respirator?
 JFB: Yes - respirators
 MSmits: 10000 is probably not as bad as it sounds
 Astrobytes: Ventilator is correct
 Astrobytes: *also
 darkhorse64: In france, the figures are not that much higher but growing. Therefore, the government policy is to restrain virus propagation as much as possible in the hope that our resources do not get saturated
 MSmits: less than 20% of the people catching the virus actually needs a respirator and many people will not catch it and also they will not need respirators at the same time
 Astrobytes: Well, in the UK we have a serious healthcare crisis even without this pandemic so...
 MSmits: yeah that makes it  alot worse =/
 MSmits: hopefully this crisis will change politics to focus more on health care in the future
 Astrobytes: Don't be silly. 
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: I'm optimistic :P
 Astrobytes: No one ever learns.
 MSmits: though, a lot of healthcare problems can be prevented. So much diabetes out there for example
 eulerscheZahl: summary of my school time
 MSmits: diabetics are vulnerably to corona also
 MSmits: vulnerable
 Astrobytes: Our healthcare crisis is that the health service lacks funding. They plan to privatise it and sell it off, so they've been effectively asset-stripping it for a long time
 MSmits: health care privatisation is bad

 JFB: In my country is officially to work remotly for all who has such possibility 
 FuSheng: sorry i left that day, was in a bad mood honestly
 MSmits: JFB here too
 MadKnight: welcome back FuSheng
 FuSheng: hey
 Astrobytes: How is your Python FuSheng?
 FuSheng: what are you guys up to?
 MadKnight: what are u gonna do today&#160;?
 FuSheng: oh hey astro
 FuSheng: i dont know, ive wasted 10hours since i woken up lol
 FuSheng: just mayybe read up on tutorials from ww3 schools
 JFB: But our government was similar to Trump in previous weeks - and now try to "start fight" So make stupid moves too. Cancelled all flight - immediatelly. 
 FuSheng: oh yeah crap my project starts on monday... officially
 JFB: So if yo are abroad - you can not return to country
 Astrobytes: Most of the European response has been shockingly slow JFB
 FuSheng: well im so screwed if i cant  finish learning python before next week
 MSmits: They should have at least cancelled all events as soon as the first case appeared
 MSmits: you can't contain this 
 MSmits: but slow it down helps a ton
 Astrobytes: Trying to balance economic crisis and health crisis... priorities
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: Markets &gt; People
 MSmits: for some yeah
 FuSheng: oh yeah i wondered why python in codingame is different from the compilers online
 FuSheng: like i wanna manually input stuff lol
 struct: CG is not for that
 FuSheng: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/101354e1-138f-4817-a766-7b72c6528256">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/101354e1-138f-4817-a766-7b72c6528256</a>
 FuSheng: lol nevermind  im so gonna fail this
 MSmits: if you fail at it, make sure you know if this because of lack of knowledge of python or because you dont know what the program is supposed to do
 FuSheng: uhhhh 
 FuSheng: first i needa create a function right?
 FuSheng: now i know how to get n via n = int(input())
 MSmits: no, first you need to know how the program is supposed to solve htis
 MSmits: you shouldnt even really be coding yet
 MSmits: take a small number, say below 100
 FuSheng: so when u input the value u wanna see the prime factors of the value
 MSmits: see if you can solve it by hand
 MSmits: without any code
 MSmits: then think about how you did that
 MSmits: do it a couple of times if necessary
 MSmits: then turn it into code
 FuSheng: solve it by hand? 
 MSmits: yes, piece of paper, pen
 FuSheng: like writing a  pseudo code?
 MSmits: if you want, but pseudo code is already one step further
 MSmits: first you need to mess with it
 MSmits: learn about the problem
 MSmits: see what works
 MSmits: then write it down as pseudo, or directly into python, whatever you want
 FuSheng: cant use a while loop for this project..
 Astrobytes: Yes but take each step you made in solving by hand, then translate that. The steps you take is your algorithm.
 FuSheng: uhhhhhh 
 MSmits: you're already thinking about loops FuSheng... thats a step too far
 MSmits: dont think about code yet
 MSmits: just solve it on paper
 FuSheng: how do i solve it on paper
 MSmits: if you can;t, you cant solve it with code either
 Astrobytes: ^
 FuSheng: isnt it the same as typing  on here
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: on paper you can draw
 struct: By using pen and paper you will find how to solve the problem
 MSmits: scribble stuff.. cross it out, chane it
 struct: What steps you need to do
 MSmits: change
 FuSheng: uh
 MSmits: the thing is, if a solution on paper works for small numbers (which is all you can do on paper), it will work for larger numbers when you turn it into code
 FuSheng: # get  n  #display prime factors of n # find total sum of prime factors&#160;? 
 MSmits: allright, say the number 20
 MSmits: how would you factorize it with prime numbers?
 FuSheng: #1 x 20 # 2 x 10 # 2 x 2 x 5&#160;?
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: so what you did was
 MSmits: you took the smallest prime number you can divide the number by
 MSmits: and used it until you could no longer
 MSmits: then you tried the next prime number
 MSmits: and so on
 MSmits: one division by 2 works
 MSmits: another works too (then you get 5)
 MSmits: 5 is a prime number, so you're done
 MSmits: you need several things
 FuSheng: oh
 MSmits: you need a function to get the next prime number starting from some number
 FuSheng: crap someone with javascript just did it in 321 code size
 MSmits: how do you know the code sizE?
 FuSheng: oh its shown in his tab 
 MSmits: oh ok
 FuSheng: under console output lol
 MSmits: is this a clash of code?
 FuSheng: yeah its clash code
 MSmits: ohh
 struct: If you want to learn python or anything
 struct: stay away from CoC
 Uljahn: +
 FuSheng: i figured out its sort of similar to ww3 projects 
 MSmits: if you're still struggling with coding, it might be more relaxed to just try easy puzzles
 MSmits: take your time
 FuSheng: like on ww3projects theres lots of project and example solutions
 FuSheng: what puzzles can i work on for basics to practice like functions&#160;?
 FuSheng: strings list tuples sets 
 Uljahn: classic easy puzzles with corresponding tags
 FuSheng: ok cool let me see
 FuSheng: oh yeah @smith, i never thought of getting the next prime number in a function 
 FuSheng: i think i lack in logical thinking xDDD
 MSmits: it's something you can improve a lot with practice
 FuSheng: really&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, logic follows patterns
 MSmits: you are already very good at pattern recognition. You just did not learn to do it consciously
 FuSheng: oh
 FuSheng: wait how do you know that
 MSmits: cuz every animal is
 FuSheng: you should test me on one and see if i can do it xDD
 MSmits: especially humans
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hey peepz
 MSmits: except PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: hi
 FuSheng: oh yeah is it me or i find a 14inch screen kinda small to code on codingame
 eulerscheZahl: it is small
 MSmits: bigger is better, but i code on a small laptop sometimes too
 eulerscheZahl: barbaric
 FuSheng: ok so crap my weekends were supposed to be for study
 FuSheng: or not actually
 MSmits: well i can't take my desktop with me in the train :P
 Uljahn: rip eyes
 AntiSquid: when on holiday i sometimes use my phone and USB keyboard
 FuSheng: ok im on a puzzle 
 eulerscheZahl: if it's chuck norris, try another one
 FuSheng: its called ANEO sponsored Puzzple 
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that in medium?
 MSmits: that sounds hard
 MSmits: do something easy
 Uljahn: you can't have community solutions for it
 FuSheng: sad i  dont see any functions catagory in the puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>go there
 Uljahn: functions can be used everywhere
 eulerscheZahl: try the puzzles without "by &lt;username&gt;"
 FuSheng: i see the loops puzzple
 FuSheng: conditions , arrays, and more loops
 eulerscheZahl: a good place to start for you
 FuSheng: wheres the puzzle that you mentioned @euler
 Uljahn: try thor, temperatures, ascii art, mime type if you haven't solved them already
 eulerscheZahl: and descent, another really simple one
 FuSheng: ok uijahn
 FuSheng: how long on average for starters to finish testcase 1?
 FuSheng: 15?
 Uljahn: wut
 FuSheng: 15minutes?
 MSmits: FuSheng really hard to say
 MSmits: I got stuck a long time on that puzzle somehow. It isn't hard, but i still got stuck
 MSmits: you need a loop, get the tallest mountain, output it
 FuSheng: oh im on the ascii art puzzle
 dbdr: wth MSmits?
 MSmits: ah ok
 FuSheng: i remember the horror of being stuck on the mountain 
 FuSheng: remember the other day
 MSmits: dbdr... this was 2 years ago when i couldnt do much :P
 dbdr: long time to do a very easy puzzle, but top 1-3 on many multis :D
 MSmits: i got confused by the double loop
 MSmits: the first while loop being the input loop
 dbdr: well, if that trend continues, we can all go home&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't enjoy ascii art and chuck norris
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: not really stuck but unmotivated to do string manipulation
 dbdr: yeah that's something else
 struct: I hate string puzzles
 FuSheng: wait
 AntiSquid: i did bruce lee before i did chuck norris and for some reason chuck norris one felt harder :p
 FuSheng: ascii art is hard
 FuSheng:&#160;:(
 FuSheng: uhh can i just use this lol
 FuSheng: import datetime
 FuSheng: print(datetime.datetime.now())
 FuSheng: wew dark mode feels better
 MadKnight: it sure does
 FuSheng: damnit ima go back to descent mountains
 BioLampshadeFromTheSwamps_299c: hi everyone
 MadKnight: hi bio lampshade
 BioLampshadeFromTheSwamps_299c: i'm looking for information on a design pattern
 BioLampshadeFromTheSwamps_299c: I saw the implementation on a test but couldn't figure out which one it was
 BioLampshadeFromTheSwamps_299c: i remember in the code they called the class driver and they tested if a file existed then it was loaded, if not an exception was thrown
 reCurse: MSmits have you been able to identify the features leading to RPS in oware?
 MSmits: reCurse not really, I didnt watch many games. It's just that whenever I found a good value for any parameter, if i micro-fit it (changes &lt; 1%) I get wildly differing results, especially in regards to fitness vs Robo
 MSmits: it is true for almost any parameter
 FuSheng: zzzzzzzzzzzxxxzxzxzxzxzxzxzx
 FuSheng: why does codingame look so hard
 MSmits: it doesnt really happen when a parameter has a bad value. But as soon as it gets closer to the best fit for that particular local maximum, it starts to really vary in winrate
 FuSheng: is there any other website that has stuff like this :c
 reCurse: Ok I was hoping you had a better idea what difference in play leads to such unstability
 MSmits: no. I  usually start to understand the game better when i start running a meta mcts, but you dont want me to :P
 reCurse: I ran a whole arena over all my ML checkpoints and while it's really stable, batches vs you and robo vary wildly
 reCurse: My experiment with trying to diminish exploitation results in weaker play too
 MSmits: weird
 reCurse: Also learns a lot slower
 MSmits: is that similar to using SA with a slower temperature change?
 reCurse: I found a checkpoint that's slightly better in arena
 reCurse: It's 90% vs you and robo
 reCurse: So far anyway
 MadKnight: anyone getting random timeouts&#160;?
 reCurse: Yeah
 MSmits: What you really need is to submit that and have me overfit it again. If I dont succeed that time, then your good
 MSmits: you're
 FuSheng: OH MY GOD I FINISHED 1 TESTCASE LOL
 MSmits: grats :P
 FuSheng: ok crap now im failing the second one 
 reCurse: I'm more curious at what's going on tbh
 MSmits: me too... we discussed it a few times here. Me and Astrobytes mostly. There is something weird about this game
 AntiSquid: i test cased the finish
 reCurse: I'm not interested enough to study the game too
 reCurse: If it was something visual like a physics game then sure
 reCurse: But abstract games like that, ugh
 MSmits: I think it may be related to the fact that it is so simple as to be almost solvable
 FuSheng: wait how does 
 reCurse: At least it's not uttt
 FuSheng: thor is so weird 
 MSmits: uttt doesnt have this problem though&#160;:)
 MSmits: the only overfitting you can do is a counter opening book
 FuSheng: lol im just printing "E to make it go straight
 reCurse: Maybe I should create a NN for the first 20 moves and another for the rest
 MSmits: That could be a good idea in general
 reCurse: Lots of things to try but not enough compute power
 MSmits: if you are only using, say 30% of the code size, make one for the early, mid and late game
 Astrobytes: endgames are weird
 Astrobytes: Well, different
 reCurse: The problem I have is it's too specific
 reCurse: I'd like to find solutions that are not too arbitrary
 Astrobytes: "make one for the early, mid and late game" - sounds like the best thing to try
 reCurse: But right now I think it's wasting too much time with the end game
 AntiSquid: what's the full secret passcode for c++ bots? i have
 MSmits: wasting too much time training?
 AntiSquid: just realized i left it @_@
 reCurse: I'm sure 80%+ of my resources are dedicated to endgame
 MSmits: or searching?
 reCurse: Everything
 FuSheng: nooooooooo i dont understand thor game&#160;:(
 MSmits: use a solver
 reCurse: Playing them out, learning them, etc
 MSmits: i think it might actually help here
 reCurse: There are endgames which can't be solved
 FuSheng: OH MY GOD THERES CARD GAMES ON CODINGAME
 reCurse: Not without spending too much anyway
 reCurse: Can you stop spamming FuSheng
 MSmits: i mean solve them near the turn limit, many games go to 200 
 FuSheng: ok sorry
 MSmits: my bot solves them 25-30 turns before the end
 reCurse: Sure when there's a solution
 MSmits: should say plies
 reCurse: There's a lot of time spent on unsolvable games
 MSmits: there always is, with a turn limit
 reCurse: If the turn limit was pushed to 1k it would be even more waste
 MSmits: yes it would
 reCurse: Getting rid of that condition would speed up training by at least 10x I think
 MSmits: could be 
 reCurse: Either that or like I said I just train on first 20 moves
 MSmits: you might be teaching it the best way to keep into an 48 seed loop
 MSmits: and not know what to do with less than 48 seeds
 reCurse: For all I know it's spending all its time learning the fine difference between having 3 seeds left and 4 seeds left
 MSmits: and your opponent will make a mistake
 reCurse: When it doesn't matter
 MSmits: thats possible
 MSmits: you could do the following
 reCurse: I need my own server farm
 MSmits: instead of first 20 moves
 MSmits: stop at a seed limit
 MSmits: say, stop at 20 seeds
 MSmits: left
 reCurse: But how do I determine winner
 MSmits: from the score&#160;?
 MSmits: you might end up with a bad board layout ofc...
 reCurse: There's tons of games where the winner is behind the whole game
 MSmits: but just doing the first 20 turns is just as bad
 reCurse: Even if I train on 20 I still need to playout the whole game ugh
 MSmits: ok, do this then
 MSmits: keep track of states
 MSmits: as soon as one repeats, it's a draw
 MSmits: games end on loops immediately
 reCurse: I'm afraid it will learn how to avoid losses
 reCurse: With a mechanism that doesnt exist
 dbdr: you don't control the opponent
 reCurse: It would be less of a problem if at 200 turns the game would always end as a draw
 reCurse: Maybe just use current score then
 reCurse: shru
 reCurse: g
 dbdr: if the opponent chooses to get back to the same state
 dbdr: it does not look like he is winning
 reCurse: Ohh
 MSmits: oh right, that's what I should have said
 reCurse: Alphago used self resignation
 MSmits: on repeated state, higher score wins
 dbdr: that might be the reverse problem
 dbdr: the guy ahead choses the loop then&#160;:)
 MSmits: the thing is, if both sides decide to loop, then they dont expect to gain any more score out of the rest of the game
 dbdr: so intuitively I would count a loop as a draw
 MSmits: no, as a win for the one with most score
 reCurse: Is that detectable from a state?
 reCurse: Instead of a sequence
 dbdr: disagreed based on what we just said
 MSmits: it's not detectable from a state
 dbdr: you can include the set of previous state hashes into the state
 dbdr: then it is&#160;:)
 MSmits: but from any state, the future score change does not depend on the past states, only the current state
 MSmits: except when the turn limit comes into play
 reCurse: Maybe I should just trust my AI when it says it's over
 reCurse: And allow it to kneel
 MSmits: what do you mean says it's over?
 dbdr: but what if it hasn't learned yet?
 reCurse: If it estimates chances of winning is at 5%
 MSmits: oh ok
 dbdr: the estimate is random at first
 MSmits: it may learn to lie about that :P
 reCurse: Sure, just let it kick in after a while
 reCurse: Might not even matter if it's random too
 reCurse: Results are random at first anyway
 dbdr: sure
 reCurse: Lie about that?
 reCurse: No it just confirms its beliefs
 reCurse: It won't get surprised
 reCurse: If the theory that the game is decided on the first half holdds
 reCurse: Then it's a net benefit
 dbdr: you can constrain the evaluation to be symmetrical no?
 reCurse: Already did
 MSmits: hmm, well I am not sure how your process works, but if you're going to give it the win if it thinks it has 95% chance to win, it might learn to tell you that when it isnt true
 dbdr: then it cannot lie
 reCurse: No it's the other way around
 reCurse: If it doesn't see a chance of winning it resigns
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: btw I am currently doing cg bench to finish up langtons ant. Only 3 params. Want to get them to a good value before I quit
 MSmits: dont think it'll beat Redstrike, but it'll be a very strong second
 MSmits: then i'll get back to experimenting a bit with oware. I won't keep overfitting though. I just want to leave it where it's strong before i move on from that as well
 reCurse: I thought I already did that...
 MSmits: did what?
 reCurse: Leave it where it's strong before moving on
 MSmits: well your bot really wasn't strong than Robo's. It was just stronger vs Robo imho... they were almost on par otherwise. I'm guessing it is now though
 reCurse: This is entirely distracting me from FB too
 reCurse: You keep saying my bots aren't as strong as whoever else is competing :P
 MSmits: i mean what i did was, i tried A LOT of parameter combinations
 MSmits: robo was harder to beat most of the time
 MSmits: and you already noticed it is easy to overfit vs someone
 MSmits: dont you think your previous version was a bit overfitted vs Robo?
 reCurse: How could I tell
 MSmits: you can't, but all i am saying is, your 60 something&#160;% winrate vs robo doesnt say much
 reCurse: Also it can't overfit vs robo because it doesn't learn vs him
 MSmits: it can still end up with a framework that works better vs him than the other way around without being objectively stronger
 reCurse: You're tuning your params according to benches
 reCurse: My AI is tuning its params according to itself
 reCurse: Huge difference
 MSmits: I know
 MSmits: but it still ends up with a structure that may be weaker to some and stronger vs others
 MSmits: even if it is not intentional
 MSmits: rps happens whether you want it or not&#160;:)
 MSmits: I actually have had versions that lost 95% of games vs Robo and won 55% vs you
 MSmits: and not just with 1 value either... in a range of param values
 MSmits: but it's moot now, you've improved your NN
 reCurse: Maybe your params were naturally more predisposed to overfitting my bot
 reCurse: Who knows
 MSmits: completely possible
 reCurse: That's why I wanted more game insight
 MSmits: honestly I dont think this game is much easier to understand than uttt :P
 reCurse: Well it has score for one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just fyi MSmits running the minmax on UTTT small boards took 3s on my machine, and would never complete in under 1s on CG
 MSmits: sucks PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: stupid php
 MSmits: true reCurse, but as you noticed, you can have 5 points vs 20 and still win because you're hogging all the seeds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so I then tried to put the results in a constant and kept getting codesize too big
 reCurse: The simple fact AI can learn something vs not at all for uttt
 reCurse: Makes me think there's something readable
 MSmits: it's also a simpler game. If you had more resources, you could probably do the same for uttt
 MSmits: i mean both locally and on cg servers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So i shrunk it to 44k, and then ran into line break issues in the ide
 MSmits: awari is actually solved, the only thing our oware has thats different is the handling of loops and the turn limit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so now I can autohandle small board decisions
 MSmits: i think uttt is slightly more complex than checkers
 dbdr: PatrickMcGinnisII don't you want to use a different, faster language?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so until i evolve my big board ai, I'm stuck at 2nd place in wood
 MSmits: i told him many times dbdr. He likes php and the challenge 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, is a challenge
 dbdr: you have the spirit to do golf&#160;:)
 MSmits: dbdr are you good at regular multis? you seem to really excel at golf, optims and such
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So a few days of fumbling around and I finally am getting from cp from uttt
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cp from
 dbdr: well, you can check my results, MSmits. I have a few good ranks in multi, less than optim and golf indeed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i thought my simple approach would get me silver....stupid boss is blocking me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: golf even sucks for php
 MSmits: I play those board games specifically, i dont see you there too often. I am guessing you did a lot of those older multis and did well
 dbdr: I had a lot to learn, and using Rust is obviously better than Java to get that last bit of performance
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gold is the goal, but the game has been out so long the competition is stiff
 MSmits: your bandas and breakthrough are good
 dbdr: there are still many multis I haven't done seriously
 MSmits: I'll try to beat you at breakthrough in the near future... it seems like a real challenge. No easy way to make a good bot
 dbdr: even more true for you MSmits&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how do yall  get large datasets (&lt;100k) into your CG bots?
 MSmits: well for me it's hard to do them half seriously
 MSmits: so it's not at all, or all the way
 MSmits: most multis are completely untouched
 dbdr: kind of same, but it also depends on the game
 dbdr: I'm gold in codebusters with a simple heuristic
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII you can do max 200k if you encode it with unicode characters
 dbdr: CSB too of course&#160;:)
 MSmits: I should do one of those heuristics for an old multi and get Dutchie nr 1&#160;:)
 MSmits: counterBalance still has it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unicode, hmmm...ahh 2 bytes per char....I just used the 88 web safe chars
 MSmits: it gets messy pretty quickly if you try to use the full unicode range
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i should say, php safe
 MSmits: some of that stuff doesnt copy-paste properly
 MSmits: invalid characters
 dbdr: worse than that, it's not legal characters
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: you can send it still
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i stuck with $symbols="0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!#%()*+,-.:;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^_`{|}~";
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for encode/decode
 MSmits: not sure how, re curse did it, others too
 reCurse: Copy/paste works on invalid chars
 MSmits: didnt work last time i tried...
 dbdr: any value from 0 to 65536 as binary? I doubt it
 reCurse: Then you did it wrong
 MSmits: that's possible
 MSmits: might be my operating system?
 MSmits: or something?
 MSmits: browser?
 MSmits: not sure what controls the clipboard tbh
 reCurse: No good software would risk corrupting your data because it thinks it's invalid
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, extended codes would have worked too i guess
 MSmits: so you're using bad software reCurse?
 reCurse: No?
 MSmits: :confused:
 Uljahn: can you submit via handcrafted request to api?
 reCurse: Why would a good software change data on your behalf because it thinks it's invalid
 reCurse: It will just treat the char as invalid and keep it
 dbdr: because it's the correct thing to do?
 reCurse: ...
 dbdr: as per the standard
 MSmits: I have no opinion on this as I have no ideas of the pros and cons. Pasting unicode stuff into the CG IDE is not exactly what systems are designed around 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i still think only 215 of the standard codes are gonna interpret correctly
 reCurse: Anyway, all of the software I use correctly keeps invalid characters through copy/paste and whatnot
 MSmits: ah ok
 dbdr: you don't control what softare CG uses
 reCurse: I don't even
 reCurse: What
 dbdr: the data goes through many layers
 dbdr: maybe we don't speak about the same thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG chat breaks on alot of weird combos
 MSmits: but apparently the CG controlled layers dont corrupt the data dbdr
 MSmits: otherwise reCurse wouldnt be able to do it
 MSmits: so it must be on my end
 reCurse: If it sees an invalid codepoint why would it delete the character
 reCurse: That makes no sense
 reCurse: Nothing does that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but the ide accepts alot more
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/fffd/index.htm">https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/fffd/index.htm</a>
 reCurse: That's for display purposes
 dbdr: there's a unicode character designed for that especially
 reCurse: Not data
 dbdr: no
 MSmits: it doesnt delete the character, it creates a&#160;?  with a box around it or something
 MSmits: so it changes it
 dbdr: "used to replace an incoming character whose value is unknown or unrepresentable in Unicodecompare the use of U+001A &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/001a/index.htm">https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/001a/index.htm</a>&gt; as a control character to indicate the substitute function"
 dbdr: *replace*
 MSmits: that sounds like what happens in my case
 reCurse: For display
 dbdr: reCurse: are you checksumming the data? if you use it for weights, it's possible you get garbage in those rare cases&#160;:)
 dbdr: and don't know about it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ÔøΩ
 MSmits: that would be an interesting bug lol
 reCurse: Yes it's 100% valid
 reCurse: Because it would make no sense for a transport layer to change its data because it thinks a codepoint is invalid, when it could be valid in the future
 reCurse: Makes 0.0000% sense
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can represent a 26 bit number with 4 characters and 88 symbols
 MSmits: I should try it again at some point. Last time i tried it was with C#, that probably doesnt matter though
 reCurse: That's the very definition of unicode to be extensible
 reCurse: Deprecating data would be senseless
 dbdr: some codepoints are guaranteed to be invalid
 dbdr: that won't change
 dbdr: why do you think they defined those?
 reCurse: Doesn't mean it's safe to replace them?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so utf16 works in CG?
 MSmits: you know... it seems easy to prove doesnt it? reCurse says he proved it works. dbdr now you try it. Let me know if you succeed&#160;:)
 reCurse: Not utf16
 reCurse: utf8
 dbdr: utf8, sure
 dbdr: but that can take many bytes per character
 reCurse: That's the whole point
 reCurse: CG counts characters not bytes
 struct: yah
 dbdr: utf8 is binary, not characters
 dbdr: we are mixing everything :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reCurse, hell to the yea, i get it now
 dbdr: CG counts UCS2 units, I think. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i still think there are weird combos to avoid, care to clue us in reCurse?
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: It counts UTF8 characters
 dbdr: given to us for legacy reason from the time where there were less than 2^16 unicode codepoints
 dbdr: absolutely not
 darkhorse64: Using PHP on UTT is like bashing your head with a hammer and pretending it's good because when you stop you feel better
 dbdr: "UTF8 character" does not make sense
 struct: Using PHP is like ...*
 struct: Fixed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx darkhorse
 reCurse: Number of codepoints if you prefer
 reCurse: Come on
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm finally getting some CP in php in uttt
 dbdr: but there are more than 2^16 codepoints
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :p
 MSmits: how do you get cp in wood PatrickMcGinnisII?
 reCurse: So?
 darkhorse64: PHP uses $ to pretend it's a rich language
 dbdr: can you pack more then 100K * 2 bytes?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits just got to be in top 1000 for cp
 MSmits: ah
 dbdr: it's not codepoints either
 dbdr: my guess is their backend is all Java, so they just count length of java String objects
 dbdr: which is UCS2 encoded
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still  .11 points from silver...stupid boss
 reCurse: Pretty much
 reCurse: And it won't replace invalid characters
 reCurse: To come back to the original point
 darkhorse64: There is an achievement to code horse duals in bash, there should be onz for TTT in PHP
 MSmits: well i'm encouraged by your conviction. I will give it another try if I run out of codespace next time I try to make an opening book for a multi. thanks reCurse&#160;:)
 MSmits: though running out of codespace doing that seems very hard
 reCurse: Haven't had that problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, how many 26bit data points can you pack in CG with unicode?
 dbdr: reCurse: I think we are speaking too generally to be clear. do you want to clarify what technique you use?
 dbdr: or is it a trade secret?&#160;:)
 reCurse: Well it used to be, but not anymore because I keep getting involved in discussions
 dbdr: your choice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hahahaha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i would get there eventually...next year
 reCurse: I'll just say put codepoints to get a lot more than 8 bits per character
 dbdr: given almost all characters is valid, it does not matter much if it's 99% or 100%, does not give a measurable advantage
 dbdr: i'm rather curious from the correctness point of view
 reCurse: All I can say is I'm using invalid codepoints and it has never mattered
 dbdr: sure
 reCurse: And upon further thinking it would make no sense for it to matter
 dbdr: are you saying you get exactly 16 bits per character?
 MSmits: or more than that?
 reCurse: You can't get more than 16 bits because of what dbdr said
 reCurse: But in theory you could
 reCurse: If java ever supports more for instance
 dbdr: it all depends how CG counts, doesn't it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it reminds me of md5
 reCurse: 99% sure CG only does string.length
 dbdr: yeah, I think the same
 MSmits: allright, getting some food, ttyl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still have to put in linebreaks, ide hates long data
 reCurse: Hehe yeah
 dbdr: the thing, I don't think you can paste byte 0 in your IDE, can you? or send it through the API
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, my gf is off work... gotta make the bed.&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz, good stuff reCurse
 reCurse: You want to avoid control characters sure
 dbdr: I though you said all characters get through
 dbdr: except those that don't?&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe i will leave chat open, recurse might spill some more...gj dbdr
 reCurse: Well even control characters shouldn't matter tbh
 reCurse: It's just software tend to attach meaning to them
 reCurse: But it's not an encoding issue
 reCurse: Completely different
 reCurse: It's not because of invalidity but because of meaning attached to it
 JBM: awwwww missed an encoding debate again&#160;:(
 JBM: so what's the consensus? CG just counts codepoints?
 reCurse: Yes
 JBM: with no normalization?
 dbdr: UCS2 units, not Unicode codepoints
 dbdr: welcome to the chat JBM :D
 JBM: i'm like feeling 10 years younger
 dbdr: just added level of complexity, we were missing that&#160;;)
 JBM: debating that on the early days of the golfing stackexchange
 dbdr: doesn't golf usually count bytes?
 dbdr: outside of CG?
 JBM: multiple sites, multiple rulesets
 JBM: and bytes still need an encoding
 dbdr: yes. you could restrict to ASCII, honestly. or UTF8 bytes
 JBM: ucs-2 doesn't seem to tolerate emoji, does it?
 dbdr: you use two of them for one unicode codepoint
 JBM: ugh
 JBM: wasn't that encoding supposed to be a mistake that should have died years ago?
 dbdr: actually that's UTF-16
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#Code_points_from_U+010000_to_U+10FFFF">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#Code_points_from_U+010000_to_U+10FFFF</a>
 dbdr: mistakes never die
 JBM: well if ucs-2 does the same, it's no better
 dbdr: UCS-2 just does not support them, it seems
 dbdr: otherwise they're essentially the same
 JBM: so ucs-2 is just a list of unicode codepoints, laid out with whatever byte order, excluding anything out of the BMP?
 dbdr: I think the word pretty much converged on utf-8 where space matters, and utf-32 when you want constant time indexing
 JBM: yes, that's where i was
 dbdr: but you still need to support all the choices made earlier
 JBM: with ucs-2 supposed to be dead ‚Äúdoesn"t handle unicode‚Äù and utf-16 ‚Äúuseless compromise‚Äù
 struct: I just use the chars available on my keyboard
 struct: and I think it will remain this way
 JBM: that's not much
 JBM: unless you've got a 16-bit keyboard
 dbdr: 1 bit keyboard with two keys
 JBM: ctrl and alt?
 dbdr: you can type anything
 dbdr: 0 and 1
 JBM: lemme summon chuckie
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall ain't right in the head

 AntiSquid: MadKnight ban this spammer ^
 dbdr: MadKnight ban this banner ^

 ThePythonian: Why not ban everyone?
 dbdr:  /ban *
 ThePythonian: del server
 AntiSquid: no need to del server
 AntiSquid: they are burning when new league opens
 Astrobytes: Or someone promotes in CSB
 dbdr: Astrobytes: thanks for mentioning Peep Show
 dbdr: I like it
 dbdr: similar humour, but more weird :D
 Astrobytes: dbdr it really is their finest work imo
 dbdr: reminds me a bit of the UK Office
 Astrobytes: Style-wise, for sure yeah
 Astrobytes: And equally cringe-based humour 
 dbdr: exactly
 dbdr: some internal monologues are just incredibly funny
 Astrobytes: Ohhh yeah :D
 AntiSquid: MadKnight are you there?
 Uljahn: has it something common with Monty Python?
 Astrobytes: Quite different humour Uljahn, though I love Monty Python
 dbdr: I'm sure MP had some influence on them still
 dbdr: but they have their own style, definitely
 Astrobytes: Pythons influenced almost every UK comedy, and beyond
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:)
 dbdr: also Fry and Laurie
 Astrobytes: Definitely
 Astrobytes: You've also seen the Blackadder series'?
 dbdr: yeah, but I didn't get that much into it
 Astrobytes: Some series are better than others, but it can be wickedly funny
 dbdr: I tried a few episodes in the 17th century or sth, and a few 1st word war
 Astrobytes: I guess it's quite British humour, even though it's ripping the p*ss out of the British establishment through the ages
 dbdr: I love british humour
 dbdr: but yeah, maybe this one has more references to specifically british things
 Astrobytes: It's certainly quite unique&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: True
 Astrobytes: Like Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger is actually portrayed as a young boy in Blackadder, just based on "the Younger"
 Astrobytes: Lots of little things that are easy to miss
 Astrobytes: Twists on historical facts, characters etc
 MSmits: is the humor in last week tonight by John Oliver typical British humor?
 MSmits: if so, then I really like it too
 Astrobytes: Yeah, mostly. Tweaked a bit for American/worldwide audiences but at heart yeah
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: He is good
 MSmits: very, I remember when i he did the daily show for a few months
 MSmits: he was almost as good as jon stewart and better than trevor noah
 Astrobytes: Yep me too. Jon Stewart was a hard act to follow
 Astrobytes: I'd almost forgotten about Trevor, lol. HE just wasn't all that
 MSmits: um he is still doing it :P
 Astrobytes: I know, I stopped 
 Astrobytes: Watching, that is
 MSmits: ahh ok, I still watch it, but only because there isnt a better alternative on the air here. I have to see other shows on YT
 MSmits: like colbert, seth meyers, jimmy kimmel. I prefer those
 MSmits: conan is awesome too
 Astrobytes: I very rarely watch anything on the TV
 MSmits: same
 Astrobytes: Well, I hook it up to the PC and watch stuff but you know what I mean
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: trevor noah's stand up is actually quite good
 MSmits: I just dont think he's that great of a late show host
 Astrobytes: Haven't checked his standup, but he's a pretty wooden host
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: try some netflix specials of his, you wont regret it
 MSmits: bill burr cracks me up more though
 MSmits: and ricky gervais
 MSmits: ricky's stand up is the best I've ever seen
 Astrobytes: Cool. Gervais is good, haven't seen any of Bill Burr's
 Astrobytes: I grew up watching Billy Connolly standup
 Astrobytes: *standup shows before I get a smart comment :P
 MSmits: Bill Burr is like Seinfeld commenting on stupid daily stuff only it is less being annoyed and more raging about it 
 MSmits: very politically incorrect
 MSmits: also
 MSmits: dont know bill Connoly
 Astrobytes: Famous Scottish comedian, look up some of his old classic performances. Very un-PC but extremely funny
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30IOKP2GcjY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30IOKP2GcjY</a>
 MSmits: can't really understand what he's saying
 MSmits: automatic subtitles gets all the words wrong also
 Astrobytes: Seriously? He's quite polite
 MSmits: it's not about politeness
 Astrobytes: Accent-wise
 MSmits: well it's too much for me =/ I love the accent, I just dont know what he's sayin
 Astrobytes: (easier to understand) but he does get into some Weegie language
 Astrobytes: (Glaswegian)
 MSmits: ahh
 Astrobytes: Maybe look up his international shows, he's less colloquial-scots in those
 MSmits: i was thinking Wookiiee
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: A bit hard to understand
 struct: But I can manage
 dbdr: This guy really knows how to tell a joke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oseqh7SMIvo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oseqh7SMIvo</a>
 Astrobytes: Billy's a wonderful storyteller, very Celtic way of being funny
 MSmits: I must have watched every talk show appearance by Norm several times now :P
 MSmits: he's most funny on talk shows
 MSmits: outside of that, he's ok, but brilliant on those late night talk shows, mostly conna
 MSmits: conan
 Astrobytes: ffs, punchline was lame but how he got there was great :D
 Astrobytes: Nicely done
 MSmits: all his jokes are like that 
 MSmits: the moth joke is famous
 Astrobytes: Will check him out
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUjIM-GFWhk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUjIM-GFWhk</a>
 Astrobytes: FOR F*CKS SAKE
 dbdr: yeah,  the moth one is pretty good! didn't know it
 Astrobytes: Dear oh dear. Love it
 Astrobytes: Like his style
 dbdr: I get the feeling he might be slightly high, no?
 MSmits: he speaks that way 
 MSmits: someone animated the moth joke also
 Astrobytes: Nah he ain't high
 dbdr: maybe he speaks like this when he's high&#160;;)
 MSmits: anyway, watching norm appearances is one of the things i do when i am too tired from work to do any coding
 Astrobytes: Nice. I pet my cats and contemplate my existential dread :P
 MSmits: sounds like a reasonable alternative
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: hey for cgbench&#160;:20:05:14,355 FATAL Error while retrieving account cookie and sessionjava.lang.IllegalStateException: Login failed, please check login/pwd in configuration
 AntiSquid: i don't get it @_@
 AntiSquid: the login is correct
 MSmits: we can check it for you
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: lul
 AntiSquid: sure i give you an alt 
 MSmits: no no
 MSmits: i have had this sometimes
 Astrobytes: it's a session issue no
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: so what should i do&#160;?
 MSmits: i think maybe it is more likely to happen when you login to the website and back out, or maybe when you run other games during the batch
 MSmits: not sure
 MSmits: does it happen every time:
 MSmits:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I've always cleaned cache/cookies and stayed logged out when I've run bench, not sure if that is necessary
 AntiSquid: does it need to be specific email address&#160;?
 MSmits: your e-mail adress is the login isnt it
 AntiSquid: i mean from certain providers
 MSmits: oh, nah if you can login here, you can login through cgbench
 Astrobytes: Yeah as long as it's a valid CG account it's cool
 dbdr: well, do you ever need to relogin?
 dbdr: I never seem to get logged out
 AntiSquid: which browser does it try to access though&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or it's not via browser&#160;?
 MSmits: probably not
 AntiSquid: i mean why else would i have to log out
 MSmits: no i meant, clicking logout may do something server-side that invalidates your cg bench cookie
 MSmits: if you dont do that, then i have no idea what happens
 MSmits: Astrobytes I am fitting langtons ant parameters now. It's such a relief to have a coherent result for once
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/Bb3efvT">https://imgur.com/a/Bb3efvT</a>
 MSmits: my next dot falls right on that line also
 Astrobytes: yay, no wildly varying periodic madness
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: can't get close to Redstrike with it I think though, but that's ok. Ill fit what I have and then it's time for Onitama I think
 Astrobytes: Don't imagine there would be for Langton's. I haven't looked at Langton's lb, how far ahead is he? I'm going back to Oware when I'm better. 
 MSmits: he's extremely far ahead. Even more so than the NN's in oware if that's possible
 Astrobytes: wow, what's he using? 
 MSmits: no idea, but he uses java, so I am pretty sure it is just a good algorithm or a magic heuristic somewhere
 MSmits: I think he spent a lot of time experimenting
 Astrobytes: Interesting. I'd guess it involves heavy pruning
 MSmits: I'm also heavily pruning, in fact that parameter I just shared is the pruning parameter
 MSmits: the number is how many moves I consider
 Astrobytes: It's necessary in Langton's for sure, but he must be doing some very clever pruning
 MSmits: maybe, I thought mine was pretty much common sense
 MSmits: it's just the available cells in the ants path
 Astrobytes: That's the most logical yeah
 MSmits: He might be doing something in the last few plies
 MSmits: langtons ant really hinges on the last few cells colored
 MSmits: because often the ant goes off into an empty area and make a whole lot of cells one color at the end
 Astrobytes: Right, yeah that's a good point
 MSmits: But for me, not worth spending two weeks experimenting just to try and achieve 2 -&gt; 1
 Astrobytes: I've not really gone deep enough into it to comment much further but that I have definitely notices
 Astrobytes: *noticed
 MSmits: onitama caught my eye because it is very bitboardable. I did not know that 
 Astrobytes: That's one of euler's multis right?
 MSmits: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Are you done with checkers now then?
 MSmits: Oh yeah, I could have done 2 more things. Write a better eval and switch to a different search
 MSmits: different search would be too much work
 MSmits: and better eval... well... I didnt feel like doing another oware 
 Astrobytes: You went MCTS EPT on checkers?
 MSmits: it also feels like less of an achievement with a game thats less popular in CG and done to death outside CG
 MSmits: yes I did
 Astrobytes: Interesting.
 MSmits: very raw implementation. I think I could easily get 4 with it. But the top 3 are very far ahead
 Astrobytes: Well, not really. CG versions of games are often very different because of the time constraints
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: I was speaking more of the game itself, the bots would be different of course
 MSmits: also, people overestimate how easy it is to find good free bots by google, for checkers
 MSmits: you can find opening books though
 MSmits: but then you need to make a selection, which is so much work, you may as well write your own meta mcts fo rit
 Astrobytes: Where's the fun in finding a bot to copy?
 MSmits: i wouldnt copy a bot, but i do like finding ideas for a good eval
 Astrobytes: Oh for sure yeah
 Astrobytes: brb
 struct: I enjoy seeing others code
 struct: Seeing how the implemented stuff and such
 MSmits: ah, not me, i have trouble reading it somehow
 struct: When I'm done with CSB I'll send you a copy
 MSmits: maybe because I have a totally different style than most? I dont code collaboratively
 struct: Me neither
 MSmits: struct ohhh, that is one thing I would really like.  A working AVX sim for csb
 MSmits: I'd spend the time trying to understand that
 MSmits: would not need to see the whole bot, just the avx calcs would be fine&#160;:)
 struct: The only hard part is the collisions/bounces tbh
 MSmits: maybe once i see it work, I could figure out how to use it in other places
 struct: rest is  preety straight forward
 MSmits: yeah I just need a more complicated example than those squareroots by Marchete. Mind you, they were useful, but its not the same
 struct: Well it does have if elses
 MSmits: cant really avoid that
 MSmits: i did some coding for compute shaders. If elses hurt a lot there too, but as long as there is a net-gain it is ok
 struct: From now I just need to focus on making it work
 struct: and ditch peformance
 Astrobytes: Yeah I don't mind seeing people's code, always learn something
 struct: I mean, stop pre opptimizing
 Astrobytes: oh chat scroll
 Astrobytes: Yes struct, do that
 struct: I was trying AVX to gather stuff from array[]
 struct: but AVX performance is similar to for loop 8 times
 Astrobytes: yeah, multiple simulataneous operations. Just the loading/unloading overhead you need t obe concerned about iiuc
 Astrobytes: *simultaneous 
 struct: Is just that it does this
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dfe5a9cb-4a8c-4f67-9773-71fd195a45ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dfe5a9cb-4a8c-4f67-9773-71fd195a45ee</a>

 AntiSquid: i don't get it
 Astrobytes: No idea what I'm looking at struct
 AntiSquid: turned off AV to see it maybe blocks
 MSmits: ok, i have maybe a long shot
 MSmits: AntiSquid
 MSmits: one time I had problems with the encoding of the text file the program is in
 MSmits: if I ran it straight from the file VS uses
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/cpp-compiler-developer-guide-and-reference-mm-i32gather-ps-mm256-i32gather-ps">https://software.intel.com/en-us/cpp-compiler-developer-guide-and-reference-mm-i32gather-ps-mm256-i32gather-ps</a>
 MSmits: so I copied it in a text file with a different encoding and the error stopped
 struct: Basicly you pass indexes
 AntiSquid: the config file?
 struct: and array
 MSmits: the code file
 struct: then you get data from that array on those indexes
 AntiSquid: ahm but it bugs at login
 AntiSquid: it doesn't even reach that point you mentioned
 MSmits: oh, that last thing you pasted seemed different
 MSmits: i thought you had a different error now
 AntiSquid: nah
 AntiSquid: struggling with login lol
 AntiSquid: tried diff mail providers
 MSmits: are you trying to use multiple alts to run more cg batches?
 MSmits: you mentioned alts earlier
 Astrobytes: OK struct, yep, makes sense.
 Astrobytes: The fact it's slower/as slow as a loop must be the loading/unloading. MSmits help
 struct: its a bit faster
 MSmits: eh, i am no expert, but i know that if you try to load it from a source with data that is spread out, it's going to be slow
 struct: but only like 20-30%
 MSmits: you can load sequential data very quickly
 Astrobytes: 20-30% is not significant?
 MSmits: normally you'd get 200-300%
 MSmits: if your avx is doing well
 struct: Even more
 struct: Can even go above 500%
 Astrobytes: OK
 Astrobytes: But yeah, given how it works loading fragmented data isn't gonna work well
 MSmits: thats why my AVX-ed ucb1 code didnt work
 MSmits: I was gathering visit counts from separate nodes
 Astrobytes: Yep, that makes sense
 MSmits: even though the nodes were sequential (being siblings), they were also larger objects with other stuff in between
 MSmits: like wincounts, indices etc.
 struct: was performance worse?
 MSmits: almost the same. slightly worse than the fastest way I could do it
 MSmits: the fastest way being a lookup
 MSmits: but i dont use lookups now
 Astrobytes: Absolutely, yeah. Is there any way to make that contiguous? I don't think there is
 MSmits: so it's about the same
 MSmits: you can make it contiguous by ruining other parts of the code and making those slower
 struct: why no more lookups?
 MSmits: i hated having an artificial limit on visit counts
 Astrobytes: lol, doesn't sound like the best tradeoff
 struct:  I thought cache misses
 MSmits: cache misses hurt, but apparently not enough to make lookups slower
 MSmits: in this case
 dbdr: struct, compilers also know how to use AVX automatically sometimes
 dbdr: in that case you will get no boost from doing it by hand
 MSmits: the thing is, even though you may have 500k visits, you only use the first part of the array a lot, so cache misses may be less painful
 dbdr: because it's the same code
 struct: oh
 struct: is this why?
 dbdr: it could be
 dbdr: depends on the case
 MSmits: not in my case
 dbdr: that's what you can tell if you look at the asm
 MSmits: I was doing a special inverse squareroot for avx that was faster because it has less accuracy
 struct: special?
 struct: I will look at it dbd r
 MSmits: yeah, it uses half sized floats
 MSmits: 16 bit floats
 MSmits: dont remember the details
 dbdr: isn't it the low precision inverse squareroot?
 MSmits: one of them
 struct: the clock cycles
 struct: of the instruct of gather
 struct: are quite high
 Astrobytes: Just read that as "the dock cycles of the instinct of father"... Probably time to leave CG
 MSmits: go get some sleep :P
 Astrobytes: feck that, Picard night
 Astrobytes: Illness be damned

 Astrobytes: Oh I like at least something from just about every 'genre' of music. Not fussed on opera or modern pop/EDM though. 
 AntiSquid: MSmits give me some tips for best test results with cgbench, how do you go about it?
 AntiSquid: oh yeah, i do listen to future funk i guess or whatever it's called, electro jazz&#160;? too many random names but they are all similar
 Astrobytes: Too much pigeonholing
 AntiSquid: idk, they completely overlap imo
 AntiSquid: is it possible to get AgentID of boss for cgbench&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Exactly, people need to categorise everything these days, let music be music
 Astrobytes: Don't think so AntiSquid, rather - not that I know of
 AntiSquid: that makes life bit more difficult then
 AntiSquid: did we get rid of smits with our links?
 Neumann: Yes you can
 Astrobytes: Nah, MSmits will be cleansing his ears with some Naomi
 struct: 2 people that were being diagnosed for coronavirus just escaped from the hospital 
 Astrobytes: O cool Neumann
 AntiSquid: Neumann what's the agentid for boss&#160;? (gold)
 Neumann: AgentId&#160;: -2 is the boss of your league, or the defaultAI if in max league
 Neumann: If you want to fight a boss from another league, you can also grab it's id from a replay of him
 AntiSquid: ah ok thanks
 Neumann: Gold of XMR&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: stuck at the gates
 Astrobytes: Did not know that, thanks
 Neumann: 2223822
 MSmits: back
 MSmits: AntiSquid, if you want to fit params, start with short batches, maybe 100-200, spread them around the value you think is good
 MSmits: then you'll probably see a curve coming, try more batches close to where you think it will peak and make those batches longer if necessary
 AntiSquid: lots of params&#160;:/
 MSmits: dont try to get too accurate at first
 MSmits: switch params often
 AntiSquid: maybe should have done a NN instead
 MSmits: how many params, which game?
 AntiSquid: XR
 MSmits: I had very few params for XR
 AntiSquid: about 20 
 struct: 20 params?
 MSmits: wow
 struct: wtf
 AntiSquid: ya i had fewer ...
 AntiSquid: but then i couldn't figure where i went wrong with my bot
 MSmits: seems like i have about 5
 AntiSquid: others seem to be around #30 legend with same approach, either some bugs or hell knows what ...
 struct: what search do you use?
 AntiSquid: and couldn't find any bugs .
 AntiSquid: just basic minimax
 struct: Never tried the game
 miszu: The hardest/boring part of the AI game is to code the actual game engine
 miszu: which takes like 70% of coding time
 struct: I find it the most enjoyable part
 BenjaminUrquhart: same
 miszu: when the game engine is simple, then maybe. But when you need to play with physics and etc, so many little bugs you can have
 struct: Does anyone have the link to the "non official" CSB referee
 struct: I want to check some stuff
 AntiSquid: what does "non official" mean?
 JBM: any one that's not the one that runs on CG
 struct: the one that was leaked

 struct: thanks
 struct: I guess the off by 1 errors are explained
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: Is anyone coding in Java? Is this thing bugged? Im trying to copy the maze into an array but it can't even get to the end of my code before running out of time. As in,  a singular nested for loop.
 AntiSquid: you must have a bug somewhere
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: I figured it out. My code was expecting the length of ROW to be C, but for some reason it isn't. Any idea why this is?
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: ohhhhhh
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: somehow R and C got flipped hahaha
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: the order in which the scanner sees them. sorry for the nuisance 
 AntiSquid: no worries
 AntiSquid: feel free to ask Automaton2000 any question
 Automaton2000: but now that i think
 tartiflet: hello, is there a way to get the full "expected" string when it's too long to be printed fully in the "console" frame
 Z_Doctor: You could use an external ide to simulate a run and get the out from there.
 MeirKlemfner: Hi
 SilentKnightFromAfar_d6e: hi
 tekki: hello all
 tekki: wassup?
 JavaMan: hard to win in shortest code using java
 Z_Doctor: also could be that you are using poorly optimized java
 JavaMan: you are probably right
 Z_Doctor: and even then it's impossible to beat a good perl user at shortest too
 JavaMan: does it also count the imported libraries?
 Z_Doctor: It counts the import statements

 Archaic: hey
 MadKnight: hey hey
 kenphanith: hi
 MadKnight: what are u doing&#160;?
 jacek: happy Caturday
 braincoder2: hehehehheheheheheh!
 braincoder2: I think i just won a clash!
 MadKnight: gj now try to win a game of CSB
 MadKnight: BrainSolver
 MadKnight: braincoder2 
 MadKnight: looks like he's gone, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: now let's see what happens
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/yAZFxU.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/yAZFxU.jpg</a>
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 MadKnight: what's that dbdr&#160;?
 dbdr: the testsuite of rustc MadKnight
 MadKnight: and why did u share it&#160;?
 dbdr: I think it looks nice&#160;:)
 dbdr: testing a small change that would help on CG for rust in debug mode
 MadKnight: what change&#160;?
 dbdr: make it possible to efficiently do arithmetic operations like + without overflow checks in debug mode
 MadKnight: nice
 AntiSquid: is rust easier to debug dbdr&#160;?
 dbdr: well, this overflow check by default found a few bugs for me
 dbdr: basically for free, no work to investigate
 AntiSquid: i saw a meme about how difficult it is to fix an error in c++ compared to rust, supposedly rust has more built in support for it
 dbdr: well, there's also when your c++ code has a segfault
 dbdr: in rust that would have been a compilation error&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: so rust makes life easier?
 dbdr: (unless you use the special unsafe code, but then you are aware of doing something you need to be careful with)
 dbdr: now some people might prefer a rare crash to more compilation errors, it's a personal choice I think
 dbdr: similar to the static/dynamic typing debate
 dbdr: it makes my life easier for sure. it's also harder to learn at first when you are used to other languages
 dbdr: so it depends on your preference
 AntiSquid: i like how rust bots aren't working in IDE because of the release mode issue, so i might try it in another contest if it doesn't change
 AntiSquid: if it's not something ooc though :D
 dbdr: that's evil :D
 AntiSquid: as evil as using a faster language
 dbdr: why not on ooc?
 dbdr: no, liking that it times out&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ooc is complicated enough, don't want to also learn a language while doing it 
 dbdr: right. I think it's good to have time on the other hand, like a one month contest, or a multi
 dbdr: you don't want to learn a new language during a 10 day contest I think
 dbdr: I did the 15 puzzles on CG in rust, then I really learned it during the RAIC last year, which was 1 month
 AntiSquid: pretty much what i did so far :D
 dbdr: puzzles?
 AntiSquid: duroing contest
 AntiSquid: first serious use i mean
 dbdr: ah, with what language?
 AntiSquid: java, python, c++, although i used them a little bit before 
 AntiSquid: don't feel motivated otherwise
 dbdr: makes sense too
 AntiSquid: i basically end up google the syntax a lot 
 dbdr: with rust you will likely run into problems if you just learn the basic syntax and try to code a serious bot with it.
 AntiSquid: maybe, but i think i had that issue with c++
 dbdr: for many languages, it's mostly syntax differences, which you can google indeed, and the standard types
 dbdr: in Rust you really need to think differently because of the way it deals with memory
 AntiSquid: and there's some language specific bs with java i ran in to anyway
 dbdr: yeah, there will always be something&#160;:)
 dbdr: could be the GC in Java for instance
 AntiSquid: it was something to do with object comparison i think not sure anymore
 AntiSquid: also they differ between each other, so you might mix things up accidentally
 dbdr: right, there are subtle differences in many languages with this. equality, cloning, etc
 dbdr: AntiSquid do you have a link to the meme you mentioned?&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2jsGW4f">https://imgur.com/a/2jsGW4f</a> dbdr
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: thanks
 AntiSquid: i know the first half is true, but no idea about the second
 dbdr: well, if an identifier is mispelled, rustc will ask: did you mean that one?&#160;:)
 dbdr: like git does
 dbdr: but there is also cargo clippy, which is giving suggestions to improve your code
 dbdr: for instance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/uDNQM4.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/uDNQM4.jpg</a>
 dbdr: this is a good example too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT6W2IZW4AAyofx?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT6W2IZW4AAyofx?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900</a>
 dbdr: I think a c++ compiler would screen pages of parse errors in a case like this :D
 dbdr: *scream
 dbdr: congrats to DaNinja for promoting in Tulips!
 AntiSquid: is tulips hard to promote or what
 dbdr: not especially. but the wood boss is not stupid either
 AntiSquid: silver boss level&#160;? bronze?
 dbdr: it's community
 dbdr: wood 1 = legend&#160;:)
 dbdr: but wood 2 is probably like bronze or silver in a classical multi
 AntiSquid: ya that's what i meant
 dbdr: it's probably possible to promote with a cheese though
 AntiSquid: 230 max CP, very low on my list :p
 DaNinja: Thanks dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: are you using a search DaNinja?
 DaNinja: I tried minmax and MCTS but no success so switched to a pattern for now
 dbdr: oh, you took back the #7 from joli AntiSquid, gz. what did you do?&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: that's over a week ago
 AntiSquid: basically nothing
 AntiSquid: we were close in score
 AntiSquid: after a day i got above him not doing anything
 AntiSquid: then i improved my CR2 bot
 AntiSquid: he also didn't do anything until yesterday, i see a bump in his score, no idea what he played
 AntiSquid: +1k or so
 LelouchVC2: clash of clans
 AntiSquid: nobody gets the joke .
 LelouchVC2: damn
 dbdr: well, if you really want to know you should be able to dig the information from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/commits/master">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/commits/master</a> AntiSquid
 dbdr: it's not user friendly though
 LelouchVC2: 3 people walk into a bar
 LelouchVC2: only 2 leave
 AntiSquid: and the 3rd one ended up isolating in the bar or what
 Nerchio: the 3rd one was a java programmer and was stuck debugging timeouts on cg
 AntiSquid: why use java? isn't life worth living?
 Nerchio: i feel comfortable with it :P
 LelouchVC2: I can feel my rank decrease with every python programmer I face in a clash
 AntiSquid: what about ruby
 LelouchVC2: I've only seen 1 or 2 of those, and usually for string manipulation
 Nerchio: idk didnt touch ruby
 AntiSquid: was asking LelouchVC2 because ruby apparently can get shorter ...
 AntiSquid: dbdr you noticed my rank change but you didn't see euler drop&#160;?
 dbdr: well, because you mentioned CPs so I looked at you&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ah lol
 dbdr: euler #2, eip :D
 dbdr: rip
 LelouchVC2: I'll learn Python, get to 1st place, then put this on my resume
 AntiSquid: 1st place in coc&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: 6 Wood leagues in Botters of the Galaxy??
 WINWINWIN: And getting past wood 6 is as simple as taking deadpool and attack_nearest hero?
 LelouchVC2: Yep :D
 WINWINWIN: Lol works for Wood 5 too
 AntiSquid: because we were asked to add more wood levels before moving that game into multi&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: there are small changes in rules WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: :D but getting till wood 3 after about 10 seconds of code??
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, Im following the changes
 AntiSquid: well better than CSB no?
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, that lets u get till gold after a similar 5 mins of code :P
 WINWINWIN: target-3vel
 Uljahn: and then they whine about the rules becoming too complex to debug a simu and asking for a way to get back in previous league :smirk:
 WINWINWIN: Cant happen to me, I wont get far enough xD
 WINWINWIN: is heuristics the most common strategy for the toppers in botters of the galaxy?
 aCat: ooo euler#2!!!
 aCat: he should get all the invites for clash of code
 aCat: and improve his rating there
 WINWINWIN: :P
 PortalBot: yes WINWINWIN
 Zephyd: hello
 Zephyd: I'm lee jun gi
 Zephyd: 개떵
 Zephyd: 돼지
 AntiSquid: hello lee jun gi
 prakash218: hi
 cegprakash: did anyone do codejam 1C?
 eulerscheZahl: robostac did, #99
 cegprakash: mm
 cegprakash: I'm #6568 not bad
 cegprakash: I couldn't solve 2nd
 cegprakash: 2nd problem had multiple answers
 eulerscheZahl: i just read the 2nd statement
 cegprakash: me reaching codejam round 2 is still an achievement yet to be unlocked
 cegprakash: I've been trying for 10 years
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i would look for those lines: 14 PP
 cegprakash: oh damn
 eulerscheZahl: 2 digit output, so the first has to be a 1 here
 cegprakash: no
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 cegprakash: say if P is mapped to 8
 cegprakash: 14 and PP is still valid
 cegprakash: coz 14 &lt; 88
 AntiSquid: 10 years? idk isn't there something like a PM you can read to learn from?
 cegprakash: 14 &lt;= 88
 eulerscheZahl: the output is in 0..14
 eulerscheZahl: and it has 2 digits, thus 10..14
 eulerscheZahl: the first digit is a 1
 cegprakash: I don't understand u
 cegprakash: I only check 14 &lt;= 88
 wlesavo: cegprakash for first two cases you need only first digit of the number
 wlesavo: checking that in loop was enough for me
 cegprakash: yes u can decide 14 &lt;= 88 using 1 &lt;= 8
 cegprakash: so comparing first digit is okay too
 eulerscheZahl: for the last i guess a probability distribution for the first digit will do the trick
 eulerscheZahl: no 0 at first (2+ digits)
 cegprakash: first I check digits.. for eg. say SP for M=12832here M has 5 digits so SP is valid
 eulerscheZahl: lots of 1, few 9
 cegprakash: I check all permutations.. return the first valid solution
 cegprakash: but it seem to be multiple valid solutions exist
 cegprakash: I didn't work with probability values though
 cegprakash: I only have a 0 or 1 for all permutation
 cegprakash: but solution seem to be wanting the permutation with highest probability
 cegprakash: it's not clear in problem statement
 eulerscheZahl: to me the statement is very clear
 Astrobytes: ceg never reads any statement in it's entirety 
 cegprakash: where is the word probability
 AntiSquid: how hard were the puzzles this year eulerscheZahl?
 cegprakash: These two are valid solutions for given inputPFOXLUSHBTTPFOXLUSHB
 cegprakash: but the judge expects TPFOXLUSHB
 cegprakash: how do u decide between these two eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: round 1B was doable AntiSquid. i didn't try too hard when it was clear to me that i passed
 eulerscheZahl: round 1C (just read the statements after the round): A is an easy problem
 eulerscheZahl: B is a little tricky but i really like that one
 eulerscheZahl: not hard but needs creative thinking
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash that depends on the inputs (the 10k guesses)
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: I used the 10k guesses
 cegprakash: to find these
 eulerscheZahl: the T is the first character the most often
 eulerscheZahl: so it starts with T
 eulerscheZahl: (is very likely to start with T)
 cegprakash: there is nowhere mentioned in the statement
 cegprakash: that u need to make guesses
 cegprakash: it just wants a valid solution
 cegprakash: tell me 1 reason why PFOXLUSHBT is wrong
 cegprakash: I see a lot of Ps than Ts
 AntiSquid: ask for a refund
 wlesavo: cegprakash there are some numbers that starts with P ==&gt; P can nont be a zero 
 wlesavo: i just checked it
 cegprakash: infact for query M=1 we have two responses as P
 cegprakash: wait what
 cegprakash: :O
 cegprakash: there can't be leading zeroes
 cegprakash: f**k
 wlesavo: lol
 cegprakash: let me think
 AntiSquid: permission granted
 struct: seg fault
 Astrobytes: *ceg fault
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: I think my code will cover that
 wlesavo: well if PFOXLUSHBT is valid then you not covering that
 cegprakash: say 123 returns KRS. This guarantees K can never be 0 and I can ignore all permutations starting at K?
 Sepehr.khashei: c
 wlesavo: smth like that yes
 cegprakash: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: "say 123 returns KRS"this guarantees K=1, R=2, S=3
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, nvm
 eulerscheZahl: R can be 0 too
 eulerscheZahl: but K=1 for sure
 eulerscheZahl: so R=0 or 2
 wlesavo: if you take 102 it works
 cegprakash: i now assume K can be 0
 cegprakash: thats the issue i think
 WINWINWIN: In botters of the galaxy, how do you find out the opponent`s chosen hero?
 AntiSquid: it's in the input
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, found it thanks Antisquid
 AntiSquid: just opened up the game to find it for you lol
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: heroType, guess it should have been name? they didn't have actual names at first
 Illedan: Hello
 WINWINWIN: stupid me just going to get past wood 2&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Totally forgot about items xD
 AntiSquid: sadek11 
 sadek11: hii
 AntiSquid: don't invite me to clash
 sadek11: okay bro
 AntiSquid: please
 AntiSquid: thanks
 ALIM: Hello could anyone help me with XML MDF-2016 easy puzzle in C language? I'm new to programmin so every help is useful. Thanks in advance!
 Uljahn: if you're new go for classic puzzles first rather than community one
 AntiSquid: theres a way to select classic only?
 WINWINWIN: anyone doing botters of the galaxy now?
 WINWINWIN: Am in W1 with a 100% winrate but because of all of the tank submits, The boss has a crazily high score
 reCurse: Just keep submitting, if you're good enough you'll knock down the boss score.
 WINWINWIN: Yeah but its taking a lot of time&#160;:( I have a 90% winrate overall but the boss only goes down by .2 per submit
 WINWINWIN: It started at something like 23
 AntiSquid: check your losses
 reCurse: That sucks but nothing much to do about it
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: kinda had similar issue in last contest :p
 WINWINWIN: :D helps other people qualify too, the guy that I lost to has gone from 15 to 17 now
 AntiSquid: oh btw get an avatar, hard to tell which games you lost / won for others
 AntiSquid: if you share a loss i will try to give advice
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456650806">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456650806</a>
 WINWINWIN: Stay out of tower range?
 AntiSquid: yes ofc :p
 WINWINWIN: :P doing it now
 AntiSquid: but also you didn't use your gold for anything
 WINWINWIN: Yeah right now just trying to get till bronze for all rules
 WINWINWIN: The code is just: get deadpool and hulk
 AntiSquid: don't attack enemy heroes when the enemy units are around, they jump on your heroes otherwise
 WINWINWIN: attack_nearest heroes
 dbdr: get two hulks!
 <b>**dbdr ducks</b></p><p><img src="/a/42048260060161" /> AntiSquid: towers also had less damage back then dbdr
 WINWINWIN: Does anyone use variable heroes?
 WINWINWIN: Or does everyone stick to 1 set of heroes?
 AntiSquid: few players get a different second hero depending on enemy first pick
 WINWINWIN: Makes sense
 AntiSquid: most combinations are either 2 ranged or 2 melee heroes
 AntiSquid: then some people mix those 2 up, for example getting a ranged as second for better last hits
 WINWINWIN: Will stick to hulk and deadpool&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: too early to decide bronze is where you get access to the full game :p
 reCurse: Maybe I should sell CG boosting services.
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) Already in bronze
 AntiSquid: oh nice
 WINWINWIN: Second last submit pushed the only guy beating me into bronze
 WINWINWIN: after that 1 more submit at 100% winrate :D
 AntiSquid: maybe he will get the promotion email and return to take revenge 
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) Hope not
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, now I got the 100% winrate against bronze boss
 AntiSquid: focus on one hero at a time, then there's less overall damage dealt to your heroes, also still no items&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: i guess this was that time in bronze when everyone was just trying to generate funny replays
 WINWINWIN: Still no items
 WINWINWIN: just avoid tower beats bronze boss, but doesnt let me reach the boss though
 AntiSquid: don't forget to add hero skills 
 WINWINWIN: Working on that now
 WINWINWIN: Is focussing on a single skill for each hero enough for silver?
 AntiSquid: ya sure
 dbdr: what's that reCurse?&#160;:)
 inoryy: reCurse how much for #1 in csb
 WINWINWIN: How do you print a skill in BotG?
 struct: Should be in the description
 inoryy: I agree, reCurse rates should be in the description
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: onitama is ridiculus
 jacek: i made new heuristic which is clearly better against my old one, but its worse in real battle
 607: ебать
 jacek: and my mcts alt is better in real battle but worse in local battles :s
 eulerscheZahl: and your submit scrambled top3
 AntiSquid: winwin&#160;? gone&#160;?
 jrke: recurse nice bot in CSB
 reCurse: Thanks
 jrke: legend league of CSB seems easier after solving gold one
 inoryy: wait till you try to break into top25
 MSmits: at some point every few ranks is a new league
 jrke: K
 AntiSquid: imagine 90k made it to legend in CSB
 jacek: not so legend eh
 AntiSquid: ya that too, but was thinking about how fun a submit could look like
 reCurse: It's already terrible with 800
 Uljahn: guess leagues till gold should be wood
 MSmits: 90k people in tron legend would be interesting too
 AntiSquid: tron isn't being promoted, won't happen :p
 MSmits: i just meant because of the 24 games
 AntiSquid: but the RNG fest would ridiculous
 MSmits: dont they do every order on every 4 players?
 AntiSquid: actually UTG gold is pretty bad 
 Illedan: Can't have a 4 player game with that many players
 Illedan: The submission times :zzz:
 reCurse: Submission times are independent of number of players
 Illedan: I was refering to the pressure on the servers
 reCurse: Also independent of number of players
 Illedan: And it has 100 ms afaik?
 MSmits: the number of turns matters more
 MSmits: or the combination of the two
 MSmits: some games tend to terminate early a lot
 MSmits: some always last the full duration
 MSmits: anyone else think the smash the code rotations are unclear from the description?
 Illedan: Doing smitsi max on stc?
 reCurse: Bitboards obviously
 MSmits: maybe, for now i'll settle for a working sim and search, ignoring opponent. After than i'll experiment
 MSmits: yes bitboards first, naturally
 MSmits: I use my ooc bitboard stuff :P
 Illedan: The bitboard search? :P
 reCurse: No such thing as premature optsmitsation
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: optimize the if else in wood :o
 MSmits: in this case it isnt premature optimization, because this way of doing things feels more natural to me now. It might actually be slower =/
 MSmits: not sure how good the floodfill is
 reCurse: That's why I didn't talk of optimization
 MSmits: ow right
 MSmits: any tricks to skip a few leagues?
 reCurse: Steal code from github
 MSmits: nah
 Astrobytes: "optsmitsation" dear oh dear
 MSmits: I want a nice heuristic or two&#160;:)
 MSmits: not someone elses code
 AntiSquid: reading too fast
 reCurse: Don't stack it past the board
 MSmits: I'm in wood 1 with the same colored blocks
 MSmits: thanks reCurse :P
 AntiSquid: look for longer combos&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah I am just wondering how to code that
 MSmits: generally an easy heuristic looks at the next turn or so
 AntiSquid: watch the boss
 MSmits: it stacks up stuff left and right
 Astrobytes: Don't lose.
 Illedan: ^
 MSmits: I probably should just finish my sim and write an eval function for depth 1
 Illedan: Yeah
 AntiSquid: meditate, work out, drink enough water
 MSmits: then pick the best move
 Illedan: why waste time on a stupid if?
 reCurse: Aren't you just pushing the same question for later?
 MSmits: well, an eval function is easier to write for me than an if forest
 MSmits: in this case it's probably going to include score + number of times 2 or 3 blocks are adjacent + highest stack
 AntiSquid: you can basically do_brick_placement, check result, undo duh&#160;! :p
 AntiSquid: if score &gt; something ...
 MSmits: check result is the hard part. gotta get sim working&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: floodfill or whatever you want to call it
 MSmits: its not just that, its also skulls disappearing, blocks dropping, more floodfill from different colors, a complicated score function 
 MSmits: definitely more complicated than I thought it would be
 AntiSquid: you can always quit, right Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: at least i have a little less
 reCurse: How upset are you the board is 72 bits?
 MSmits: i would have prefered the height of the board to be 16, not 12
 MSmits: but maybe a little upset
 MSmits: i use uint16_t[6] for each color
 reCurse: I think stc is my oldest bot
 Illedan: Let's design the next game to make smitty happy with his bitboards :D
 reCurse: God it's ugly as sin
 MSmits: you know whats cool reCurse
 MSmits: you can use _pext  to drop the blocks
 MSmits: its amazing
 AntiSquid: i was thinking exactly that Illedan but thought one can always spam community puzzles with that in mind
 reCurse: I guess
 AntiSquid: also add hidden info and odd physics to make it difficult :D
 reCurse: Maybe I should try a NN for it
 MSmits: finish FB first
 Astrobytes: ^beat me to it
 AntiSquid: playing together is more fun, join MSmits
 reCurse: It just triggers me to infinity that this game is an inferior version of puyo puyo
 MSmits: i have the advantage of not knowing any puyo's
 MSmits: let alone two
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: you are about to start a new multiplayer less than a week before the contest? that's risky :P
 struct: MSmits puting piece vertical on empty space should be enough to get to bronze
 struct: iirc
 MSmits: hmm maybe, dont think so though, this is more like one of those multis i want to cross off my list. Less risk of addiction
 Astrobytes: Nah. He spent half the OOC doing UTTT lol
 AntiSquid: maybe you should cheer for him to play stc, otherwise you'll compete vs another c# bot 
 struct: So you get all the rules
 MSmits: AntiSquid depends on the game.I might use c++ in the contest
 AntiSquid: pacman with velocity and ghost trains
 Illedan: I hope I can try NN on this one
 MSmits: struct what rules
 struct: in wood 1 you have rotation right?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: But both are same color
 struct: always
 struct: on bronze not
 MSmits: seems so yes
 struct: I guess it doesnt matter much
 MSmits: I can code it as if they are different colors
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: btw struct what is a good simcount for stc?
 MSmits: so i can compare later
 struct: I had around 1mill average
 MSmits: is that 1 million blocks dropped?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: in 100 ms?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: seems like a lot, but I guess this is because most blocks do not trigger anything
 MSmits: so you're just dropping something and then it's the next turn
 struct: yeah placing a block costs almost nothing
 reCurse: lol I forgot games are 12 turns long
 struct: Preety much
 MSmits: wow
 struct: One thing I dislike aobut the game
 struct: It ends too early
 MSmits: easy fitting of constants&#160;:)
 MSmits: also easier to train an NN on short games no?
 MSmits: reward is closeby
 reCurse: Should be
 eulerscheZahl: i did a lot of offline param tuning
 eulerscheZahl: worked surprisingly well online vs other bots too
 MSmits: interesting
 reCurse: How is that surprising though
 reCurse: It's the same optimization problem on both sides
 reCurse: Not like there's a lot of ways to play the same blocks well
 MSmits: hmm well unless the constants involve when to trigger your chain and drop skulls on the other guy
 reCurse: You have maybe 8-10 turns to distinguish yourself
 reCurse: Not a whole lot of possibilities
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 MSmits: btw I have been thinking about machine learning for Onitama
 MSmits: how hard is it to use the cards as input?
 MSmits: seems an annoying complication
 MSmits: other than that it is a very simple game
 eulerscheZahl: because i just have some hardcoded constants when to attack and when to wait. completely ignoring the opponent
 AntiSquid: how do you define the input 
 Illedan: Gotta be a whole lot of possible card combinations
 MSmits: 300k or so
 eulerscheZahl: different opponents attack at different times and i don't even see the attack coming
 MSmits: ahh ok
 AntiSquid: you need to turn each card into a value or multie values and use those values as input and then use the board also as input, that's how i see it anyway
 MSmits: yeah, not easy to do though. That's a lot of input
 MSmits: struct, when the block is rotated in position 2 (sticking to the left), can you still play move 0?
 MSmits: or is it 1-5?
 struct: no
 struct: 1-5
 MSmits: ok thanks
 struct: There are 22 moves iirc
 MSmits: yeah i got that part
 MSmits: only 10 for horizontals
 MSmits: 5 when they are the same color
 MSmits: oh... skulls can;t kill you?
 struct: skulls can leave you with no moves left
 MSmits: sure, but if a line of skulls drops and you have no room up top you dont die right?
 struct: yeah, it just wont drop there
 MSmits: but will still cost nuisance points?
 struct: costs the samew
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: it's annoying you dont get the points as input
 struct: you mean nuiscance points?
 struct: or your poits?
 MSmits: nuisance
 MSmits: score you get
 struct: yeah
 struct: This can be done though
 MSmits: can you deduce the full game state?
 MSmits: or is some hidden?
 Astrobytes:&#160;;~}@&gt;??
 fvla: Which game are you discussing?
 Astrobytes: sorry, cat
 struct: Smash the code
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code/">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code/</a>
 fvla: hm
 fvla: just spam GTR? lol
 LoGos: Hi everyone!eulerscheZahl MSmits I managed to run out of memory in bandas. :sweat_smile: eulerscheZahl may I ask you one more question about your mcts?
 MSmits: gj LoGos
 eulerscheZahl: go ahead LoGos
 eulerscheZahl: and congrats
 eulerscheZahl: btw MSmits has a much higher sim count than me
 LoGos: Actually it's kind of cheating I think
 MSmits: what is?
 LoGos: I wanted to ask one important question
 eulerscheZahl: pondering?
 LoGos: do you create new nodes while simulating random game?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: the idea is that the random playout is not part of the tree
 MSmits: damnit, now I want to go back to bandas and try an early playout versions =/
 eulerscheZahl: of course my random rollout creates new nodes?
 MSmits: the random sim and the end doesnt
 MSmits: just the expansion
 MSmits: unless yours does?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not entirely sure anymore. but i think i spam new nodes or at least reserve the memory
 Scarfield: by create new notes, what do you mean, do you create an object pool in the start?
 MSmits: he has an object pool
 Scarfield: noice
 eulerscheZahl: but i reserve an index
 dbdr: my first MCTS did because "it would be a waste to throw the data out", but it's a bad idea I think
 LoGos: I mean while simulating random playout you also create new nodes representing taken actions
 MSmits: he just wants to know that after he expanded and made new children, does he make a new node for each move until the game ends
 MSmits: the answer is no, like dbdr said
 dbdr: the rollouts are too random to be relevant, and storing them just slows you down
 LoGos: Yeah thats how I managed to run OOM, but result improved only a little
 MSmits: out of mana?
 MSmits: :P
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: what are you storing in your nodes?
 MSmits: sorry, too many years addicted to everquest
 eulerscheZahl: i do that:root =&gt; enum movestake one child, enum moves from there
 dbdr: OufOfManaException
 eulerscheZahl: so that is 8 new nodes at depth 2 already
 eulerscheZahl: for a single rollout
 eulerscheZahl: i randomize the expansion order. so i create all childs and then take a random one which i havent expanded
 MSmits: I do it differently I think
 MSmits: I go down the tree with selection until I hit an unexpanded node
 MSmits: i expand that node into 4 children and do 1 simulation from each of them
 MSmits: and backpropagate 4 scores
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: that's just expansion though, not rollout
 LoGos: :laughing: Idk how else I would achieve so high node's count
 dbdr: rollout might go through 10s or 100s of states, but you don't store them
 LoGos: MSmits may I ask you how many sims/nodes do you create pern turn?
 eulerscheZahl: i expand 1 node and go further on that path of course
 MSmits: Let me go and see LoGos
 LoGos: I could only go ~100-150k in first turns
 eulerscheZahl: and along my rollout path i create 4 nodes for each unexpanded node
 MSmits: first turn with 1 second LoGos?
 MSmits: or per 100 ms?
 dbdr: along the whole path eulerscheZahl?
 LoGos: per 100ms
 LoGos: there is no 1s in first turn
 dbdr: until the end of the game?
 eulerscheZahl: do you need an image dbdr?&#160;:/
 MSmits: LoGos there is
 MSmits: LoGos how do you define a rollout? 
 MSmits: 100-150k is a lot
 struct: Which game?
 LoGos: I mean 100-150k new nodes with 1 simulation for each of them
 Scarfield: Bandas
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: Well in the first 1 second I get about 2 million new nodes
 MSmits: then per 100 ms, somewhat over 200k new nodes
 LoGos: There really is 1s in the first turn? I didn't see it anywhere...
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/MCTS-steps.svg/1200px-MCTS-steps.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/MCTS-steps.svg/1200px-MCTS-steps.svg.png</a>the point is, no nodes stored on the wiggly path at the bottom of the 3rd tree
 MSmits: i didnt either, but apparently there always is
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.webgraphviz.com/">http://www.webgraphviz.com/</a>
 Scarfield: i think its a standard to have more time first turn for every game (?)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39bf4ff4-6265-4cf1-b3c6-867b25da5ff1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39bf4ff4-6265-4cf1-b3c6-867b25da5ff1</a>
 LoGos: well s**t That's 9 missed turns for me
 eulerscheZahl: paste that code on the website
 eulerscheZahl: and click "generate graph"
 eulerscheZahl: CG always gives 1s for the first turn
 struct: yes Scarfield,
 MSmits: that's cool eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: that is because some languages are slow at startup
 eulerscheZahl: the graph sharing or the way i explore MSmits?
 MSmits: graph
 LoGos: I actually thought it's only in UTTT
 MSmits: i have no idea if the way you explore is good
 LoGos: because of 81 possible moves as first player
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i generate these graphs in code
 MSmits: LoGos, everyone starts with middle as p1
 MSmits: also out of 81 moves only 15 are unique
 dbdr: logos also it's not 81 because of symmetries
 dbdr: as msmits says&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.github.io/NumberShifting.html">https://eulerschezahl.github.io/NumberShifting.html</a>generate a level and open the console MSmits. you'll see a graph right there&#160;;)
 struct: euler seems like we can change firstTurn timeout on sdk
 struct: Is this recent?
 LoGos: Yeah I've taken it into account. I rotate my board according to enemy move if I'm first
 eulerscheZahl: are you sure?
 LoGos: brb I'm going to use these sweet new 9 turns 
 Scarfield: :D
 dbdr: decrease it to 100ms to screw JIT languages :D
 eulerscheZahl: where did you see that struct?

 dbdr: 25s first turn :D
 jacek: but, can we have a total time limit for player, not the turn one?
 struct: :D
 struct: no jacek
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, now i remember seeing that in autocomplete once
 struct: I would like it too
 Scarfield: oh like chess games?
 Scarfield: could be cool
 struct: yeah
 struct: timebank
 Astrobytes: I can't see that happening
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits as long as the UI works i don't care :D
 jacek: probably one could simulate that in referee, but its kind of unreliable
 struct: I tried its unreliable
 jacek: like theres 100ms limit, but i can do 105 or something easil
 dbdr: you can make a game where the player has to send bytecode, or sth like CGFunge. then you interpret it yourself and you can implement whatever time rules you want
 eulerscheZahl: you don't get any closer to a timebank with the first turn time btw
 eulerscheZahl: would just help for games that you solve in turn 1 such as Bender 4 or A*Craft
 dbdr: those you solve in turn 0&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: the interpreter is the only way to get close to a timebank. but then again the referee itself can timeout
 eulerscheZahl: because there's a limit too
 eulerscheZahl: not in the offline SDK
 eulerscheZahl: had to learn it the hard way during OOC
 dbdr: then the referee need to JIT the player's code
 dbdr: fun project
 eulerscheZahl: the code we inherited had a slow BFS (like 4s worstcase for a single run)
 dbdr: ouch
 eulerscheZahl: worked fine offline when we tested shooting out of the map
 Astrobytes: 4s!
 eulerscheZahl: online it crashed
 eulerscheZahl: and you don't check the timing, as the game itself takes a bit anyways 
 eulerscheZahl: it was visiting the same node multiple times because it set the parent node as visited and not the new one
 MSmits: kutulu also had a costly A* didn't it?
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: a degenerated A* that's actually BFS
 eulerscheZahl: but not visiting the same node again
 Astrobytes: The kutulu was a failed a*
 Astrobytes: dammit
 eulerscheZahl: next time i'm somehow involved in a contest, remind me to check the path finding
 MSmits: or any algorithm that is at risk of (near)infinite loops 
 eulerscheZahl: i even checked the "shoot out of map" locally to see if it crashes
 eulerscheZahl: worked fine, i didn't stop the time :cry:
 LoGos: The difference in # of created nodes in enormous D:  
 LoGos: Just with 900ms more in the first turn my node count doubled
 eulerscheZahl: and how long to these nodes survive in later turns?
 MSmits: LoGos, better to just reset your tree when you get near the end of your pool
 MSmits: problem solved
 LoGos: idk but there is an interresting pattern there. There is a sudden jump in # of simulations in the middle of the game. Now my tree can reach this state faster (?) so that's where the gain comes from
 struct: in uttt how often do you reset?
 MSmits: once at most
 struct: you reset the tree only 1 time?
 struct: The entire game
 MSmits: yes, but that's if i dont use heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: robo just starts at 0 again when you gets out of range
 MSmits: sometimes i use move-selection heuristics, if an opponent picks a move that falls out of the heuristic, my tree doesnt cover it and resets also
 eulerscheZahl: possibly overwriting the root
 MSmits: oh right, i do that too
 struct: Ok I need to redo uttt
 struct: I reset tree every turn
 struct: I start from 0
 LoGos: i think it's not the same tree
 MSmits: it honestly doesn't matter that much struct
 LoGos: really?
 MSmits: well bandas and uttt are a bit different
 eulerscheZahl: UTTT has a lot of possible moves
 MSmits: but in bandas also, most nodes in the tree for your current turn will be new nodes
 eulerscheZahl: bandas has 4 per turn, much more reusing possible
 Astrobytes: NAh just keep going until you hit the end
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i do
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i crash in longer games
 Astrobytes: wow lag much, I meant that in reusing the nodes
 struct: For example on uttt
 struct: I expand the nodes
 struct: and i almsot use all nodes I allocated
 MSmits: i'm trying to write an eval for bandas now. To see if it's better than a random playout
 Astrobytes: EPT?
 MSmits: yeah, though the way i do it, theres no sim at all
 MSmits: in oware and onitama anyway
 Astrobytes: Yeah you have the solver
 LoGos: MSmits when resetting I actually use node's before root's indexIt only works once per game though
 MSmits: no simulation after expansion
 LoGos: nodes*
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: well thats what i do in uttt LoGos
 MSmits: but in bandas it didnt work for me
 MSmits: I will end up overwriting the root eventually
 MSmits: The thing is though, I think most games are decided before you even get to the point when you're going to have to reset
 MSmits: bandas is quite unbalanced a lot of the time
 struct: I think something is wrong on my mcts implementation
 struct: I run out of nodes so fast
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan your game crashed
 eulerscheZahl: bitrunner?
 MSmits: in which game struct, also how many nodes?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The game has crashed. Please contact the author and enclose the following error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be6df6dc-634c-4ade-a3a7-cf1ae78a44bd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be6df6dc-634c-4ade-a3a7-cf1ae78a44bd</a>
 struct: I have 15 Mill nodes allocated
 struct: uttt
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Tulips and Daisies
 eulerscheZahl: that's not illedan's game
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 MSmits: 25 million for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, it was approved, i gotcha
 struct: The problem is that I almost use the 15 mill on 1 turn
 eulerscheZahl: so: crash the referee when you are losing?
 Astrobytes: eh?
 MSmits: dont make new nodes during a random playotu struct
 MSmits: thats probably what you do
 LoGos: yeah, I had the same problem
 MSmits: either that or your exploration parameter is waaaaayy high
 struct: on expansio nI do new nodes
 struct: I shouldnt&#160;?
 MSmits: sure you should
 MSmits: so thats about 7-9 new nodes per expansion in early game
 struct: yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl, yup apparently all you have to do is send a NULL NULL to the ref
 MSmits: struct I use about 8-9 million nodes in the first turn
 struct: the one with 1sec or 100ms?
 MSmits: 1 s
 struct: I use 9 mill in 100 ms
 struct: ...
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Scarfield: when expanding are you creating nodes for all children, or only one?
 MSmits: yeah definitely doing something wrong
 MSmits: it could be you're incrementing your node index by 9*9 somehow instead of by 9
 MSmits: so your nodes get spread out far
 MSmits: either that or your bot is amazing
 struct: My bot is not amazing
 struct: Is just expanding a lot
 Scarfield: suffering with succes :p
 Astrobytes: It's amazing at expanding, always find the silver lining :P
 MSmits: do some testing, just make a simple counter that increments by 1 every time you run the expansion function
 MSmits: and print it
 struct: ok
 struct: Expansion counter: 1346042
 struct: Lol
 struct: So i guess whats wrong in my code is my selection
 Astrobytes: Maybe your exploration constant as MSmits suggested earlier
 MSmits: it's still weird though, if your mcts is done right it should play a random game after every expansion
 MSmits: that random game slows you down a lot
 MSmits: 1.3 million expansions, is a lot of randomg ames
 dbdr: just pick a random outcome for the game. faster than simulating it
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: FITS
 dbdr: random vs random, what's the difference&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: "F**k It Tree Search
 reCurse: Big brain
 MSmits: right
 dbdr: Yolo Tree Search
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You life is upsidedown when the GF won't go to the store with you unless you wear protection
 MSmits: AntiSquid, please respond to this
 MSmits: So many things I could say now, but I have students that might read it
 struct: so this is my stats26k sims10Mill nodes1.3Mill expansions
 MSmits: impossible
 struct: 26k full plays*
 MSmits: every expansion should have a full playout
 MSmits: or more, even
 struct: Maybe I have definition wrong
 Astrobytes: You may have a bug.
 struct: Or maybe this aint even mcts
 struct: lol
 dbdr: MSmits you need an alt :D
 MSmits: hehe maybe
 struct: for me expansion = make children
 struct: is that wrong?
 Astrobytes: Most people have sex struct
 MSmits: but yes, thats fine struct
 struct: 26k is rolout i guess is the right definition
 MSmits: cant be
 MSmits: every rollout has 1 expansion
 struct: Ok end games
 struct: 26k end games
 MSmits: every end game has 1 expansion
 struct: wtf 
 MSmits: it's like this
 MSmits: 1 selection
 MSmits: 1 expansion
 MSmits: 1 random playout
 MSmits: 1 back propagation
 MSmits: thats vanilla mcts
 reCurse: 1 vanilla mcts
 LoGos: please
 struct: Isnt that depth 1 though?
 MSmits: thats 1 turn
 reCurse: 1 turn
 struct: hmm
 MSmits: err i mean 1 iteration
 MSmits: not 1 turn
 reCurse: -1 turn
 reCurse: 1 iteration
 struct: I do something completely different then
 Astrobytes: 1 bug?
 reCurse: 1 delete
 MSmits: reCurse i am not going to pay if this is the boosting you promised
 struct: I select expand select expand select expand.. .until game ends
 Astrobytes: -1 customer
 MSmits: struct nope, thats wrong
 MSmits: you need to play a full game after every expansion
 dbdr: 1 strawberry mcts please
 reCurse: We're out of strawberry
 struct: So what I do isnt MCTS
 dbdr: cake or death?
 MSmits: no it's not
 struct: I guess I need to read what it is
 MSmits: yep
 dbdr: might help
 Astrobytes: What you do is MCST, Monte Carlo Struct Thing
 MSmits: it's just struct thing
 reCurse: aka Monte Carlo Programming
 MSmits: there's no random
 struct: I tried smitsi with this approach too
 dbdr: maybe it's Markov chain Monte Carlo Tree Search
 struct: I guess I now see all the flaws
 Astrobytes: ST search. You invented an algo struct. tech.io article please
 MSmits: well actually it works ok in smitsi
 MSmits: at least, say you use depth 7 and you simply expand down to depth 7 randomly and then backpropagate
 MSmits: worked fine when i did it
 struct: Yes thats what I do
 struct: So the step after expansion
 MSmits: then Robo said he did an expansion and then random moves till depth 7, the way mcts should be
 MSmits: that worked fine too
 struct: is random playout?
 MSmits: yes
 struct: So is just random moves until game ends?
 struct: and I do not need to store this data?
 MSmits: yes, could be about 50-60 moves for uttt
 MSmits: just the end result
 struct: Just win or loss
 struct: right?
 MSmits: or draw
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: i suggest -1, 0 and 1
 MSmits: feels cleaner and more symmetric than the 0, 0.5, 1 many use
 struct: Yeah I have those I think
 struct: 1 0 -1
 MSmits: good
 struct: But I think I understand now
 struct: At least most of it
 MSmits: You may have some sign errors when you first make it work, that make your bot pick the worst moves
 MSmits: that always happens to me
 LoGos: struct maybe this'll help<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/7877/which-nodes-are-expanded-in-the-expansion-phase-of-mcts/7878#7878">https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/7877/which-nodes-are-expanded-in-the-expansion-phase-of-mcts/7878#7878</a>
 MSmits: hmm that's no longer vanilla mcts though
 MSmits: but its what I most often do
 MSmits: instead of doing one random playouit, you playout from each child and add up the results
 MSmits: this is preferable when the selection process is very expensive
 MSmits: or when you have very few children
 dbdr: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Vec&lt;(Peg, usize)&gt;&gt;&gt;that should do it. if not I'll add one more dimention of Vecs
 MSmits: in uttt i just do one playout
 MSmits: but i tried both ways, for me 1 was best, for others it wasnt
 struct: Thanks LoGos
 dbdr: MSmits where does the depth 7 come from?
 dbdr: just a parameter?
 struct: CSB
 MSmits: csb
 MSmits: I stop at depth 7, i had 8 for a long time, but 7 is better apparently, 6 was worse again
 dbdr: so that's early playout with an eval?
 MSmits: no, csb is smitsimax... it's the same algo i use in PCR really. Just 4 disconnected trees doing their thing only connected through the simulation
 MSmits: and combined eval
 MSmits: *in some way*
 MSmits: for PCR it's much nicer, a tree for every chip
 MSmits: well the player ones, not the neutral
 MSmits: but Marchete did it better obviously
 Scarfield: marchet e is using GA&#160;?
 MSmits: no he;s using the same as I do
 MSmits: but different move-structure and different eval
 MSmits: dbdr uses some magic monte carlo.
 Scarfield: okay, it will probably be the next multi i will try&#160;:)
 MSmits: I liked it, but the sim is a pain 
 MSmits: oh seems yurkovas is now nr 1
 MSmits: he also uses smitsi, at least I think that is what he told me
 MSmits: he tried it in csb as well, with less success
 Astrobytes: Yeah he used smitsi iirc
 MSmits: I like him, he always keeps me updated and is very friendly. Hope he sticks around. Have you seen him online?
 YurkovAS: MSmits yes, in PCR and CSB i use smitsimax
 Astrobytes: Not for a while actually, and yeah, nice guy
 MSmits: well there he is!
 Astrobytes: There he is&#160;:)
 MSmits: what are you working on now YurkovAS?
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 YurkovAS: MSmits after contest i make:Tron Battle = 38, Game of Drones = 615, Back to the Code = 920.But all is hard for me or i'm tired
 MSmits: nice, i suck at tron and drones, havent tried back to the code
 dbdr: bttc was my first multi
 dbdr: no leagues
 MSmits: oh right
 Astrobytes: That's the square-filling thing with the back in time thing right? Never got around to writing a proper bot for that
 struct: yes
 struct: with the rollback option
 Astrobytes: Yeah the time thing. 
 struct: Im gonna add that feature to Yavalath
 Astrobytes: Is it any good?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: fine with me :P
 MSmits: just roll back and pick another move that's also in my book P
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: And change the name to Y'avin-a-laugh?
 MSmits: that would be interesting
 MSmits: too bad he cant edit anymore
 Astrobytes: Sorry that's rather UK-biased wordplay
 MSmits: how is the UK now btw?
 Astrobytes: He could always make Yava 2
 struct: first Yinsh
 Astrobytes: Fucked MSmits
 MSmits: seemed that way from worldometer, it's up there with Italy and Spain
 Astrobytes: Sorry to be so blunt
 MSmits: Belgium is worst of all it seems though
 Astrobytes: Govt trying to cover up their catalogue of errors
 MSmits: really?
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes 09:48PMFucked MSmitsand now bragging in chat?
 Astrobytes: Yup.
 Astrobytes: LOL AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: too late AntiSquid, i called you back when patrick made his comment&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: what&#160;?
 MSmits: I needed you to say stuff I can't in public
 MSmits: there was much potential for jokin
 Astrobytes: You need an MSmuts smurf MSmits
 MSmits: ye
 Astrobytes: No-one will ever guess
 MSmits: at first
 MSmits: second guess will be correct though
 struct: Someone will find
 struct: Trust me
 Astrobytes: Just tell everyone someone is trolling you hard
 MSmits: first guess: Hey, did Cyber come back?
 struct: You cant hide forever
 AntiSquid: oh hm in UK the staff in the store have a windshield basically
 Astrobytes: Cyber was active in RU discord recently, not sure if he was spamming RU chat (I don't go in there)
 struct: #ru
 AntiSquid: i don't see why he'd take private business to the shop
 wlesavo: not that i saw
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: good for everyone in #ru&#160;:)
 wlesavo: maybe he is basnned in ru?
 AntiSquid: good for cyberpunk, he wastes too much time in chat
 Astrobytes: Quite possible
 AntiSquid: doubt it wlesavo
 AntiSquid: he got once kick from main channel by Madao and then stopped writing in here claiming he was banned
 wlesavo: lol
 AntiSquid: actually i forgot the exact story
 Astrobytes: Something like that
 AntiSquid: someone about MK calling him SJW and then cyberpunk blocking him was also part of the story
 AntiSquid: something *
 Astrobytes: No, I think it was feminist
 AntiSquid: ah but then cyber said he was called sjw
 AntiSquid: cyber exaggerated some stuff
 AntiSquid: i forgot why he got mad at me once
 Astrobytes: not like him
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: he was being a drama queen at some point before he left
 Astrobytes: He's a sensitive soul
 AntiSquid: he wasn't like that when afaik 
 AntiSquid: i remember / missremember him thick skinned 
 AntiSquid: non stop spam and wouldn't give a crap about the jokes coming his way
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but I think he got pwned in chat too many times
 Astrobytes: And gave up, in World at least
 Astrobytes: Who knows
 AntiSquid: it's ok, best for him to not spend entire morning typing 10-20 lines of chat in ru, that's not good use of time
 AntiSquid: it was just him typing btw
 Astrobytes: I've seen worse screenshots than that lol
 AntiSquid: although i find chess also a waste of time , but whatever
 Astrobytes: Fischer-random is nice
 Astrobytes: More gameplay less memorisation
 AntiSquid: ya so much chess theory just to get wrecked by a computer
 Astrobytes: Don't hate the game, hate the player :P
 AntiSquid: no hate
 JBM: let loose your hate
 Astrobytes: No I'm just playing on the expression
 JBM: you are angry, and in your anger lies great power
 Astrobytes: Emperor JBM in the house
 AntiSquid: smash the chess

 Astrobytes: Rum?
 JBM: not today
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: not *yet* today

 JBM: i'm in the belgian phase of my beers
 Astrobytes: Anything nice?
 AntiSquid: are you working from home and getting drunk in the morning? they can't smell your alcohol 
 JBM: just the usual
 JBM: i'm just buying them from the supermarket, i'm not going to discover anything exotic there
 JBM: yeah, i love lockdowns
 Astrobytes: True
 AntiSquid: have beer in a cup and say you drink tea if you have to talk to your colleagues online
 JBM: so tonight was delirium tremens
 JBM: as overhyped as ever, but i gotta make sure every now and then
 Astrobytes: Great name tho
 JBM: totes
 AntiSquid: lockdown is fine for some people, but really fucks up the most people i think
 JBM: i suppose
 JBM: barely changed my life
 AntiSquid: ya but if you work in hospitality you're screwed
 Astrobytes: Doesn't fuck me up, other than work I'm pretty isolated
 AntiSquid: even as a manager
 JBM: most non-food-related trades have had a very tough time
 AntiSquid: hotels and restaurants and such are screwed
 Astrobytes: Pharma PI is messed up right now, first Brexit and now this
 JBM: they'll recover
 JBM: in a slightly different shape
 AntiSquid: actually pizza hut is still open and a fish and chips shop near me
 JBM: takeaway?
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: i guess takeaways are allowed
 JBM: ok, you convinced me
 JBM: rum time
 Astrobytes: :beers:
 AntiSquid: well the folks in the flood plains have it worst ... 
 Astrobytes: And the govt continues to want to encourage building on flood plains
 AntiSquid: and since there's lockdown probably nothing will be done once again and they'll get flooded again next year?
 JBM: i suppose it's mostly safe by now
 MSmits: what is?
 AntiSquid: ya wtf, it's like UK tries hard to go backward in time&#160;:/
 JBM: i would'nt have been caught dead there during the first weeks
 Astrobytes: Indeed AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: You couldn't have been dead here if you weren't actually here JBM
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 JBM: neither would i have wished to
 JBM: it's so hard for the general public to grasp the "exponential" concept
 Astrobytes: Governments too apparently
 MSmits: it could be worse. They could be telling you to drink bleach and inject desinfectant
 JBM: including the very ministry of health
 JBM: true dat
 Astrobytes: Yep and yep
 Astrobytes: You know he was lobbied by the peddlers of that chlorine dioxide stuff before he made that statement?
 JBM: who though it was better to switch positions in mid-Jan to run for the paris mayorship
 JBM: i still can't believe it
 Astrobytes: Well played :clap:
 MSmits: lobbied?
 Astrobytes: UK was too busy playing at Brexiting.We were all warned.
 MSmits: do you have a link/video?
 AntiSquid: well if this lockdown thingy continues on for too long who knows what ideas might emerge ... "let's restructure the way we run society"
 MSmits: not in my country... here be sensible people

 Amrhossam: i want to create a new social platform like twitter or facebook
 Amrhossam: any thoughts&#160;?
 JBM: great idea
 Astrobytes: They give column space to anyone from any party ideology, they fact-check
 JBM: why are you wasting time on chat instead of coding?
 Amrhossam: time is not wasted discussing ideas
 JBM: ok
 JBM: discuss ahead
 Amrhossam: what do you think is missing from those two
 JBM: integrity
 AntiSquid: my thought is JUST DO IT
 Astrobytes: AmrhossamGramBook is the future
 AntiSquid: your users will tell you what they want
 JBM: how's diaspora going btw
 Amrhossam: more details about integrity&#160;?
 Amrhossam: tell me what do you mean
 AntiSquid: what's that Astrobytes&#160;?
 AntiSquid: are you looking for success or are you looking to please people Amrhossam&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: What's what AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: grambook 
 JBM: i was more in a "what's your sellout price" mood
 AntiSquid: spot on JBM
 Astrobytes: Just playing with his username and a portmanteau of that + Instagram + FB
 JBM: now where's that onion video
 AntiSquid: i liked hi5 back when it had chat rooms
 AntiSquid: and before they added the ability to edit your profile with all sorts of weird addons (scripts, css styles, etc)
 JBM: Here we go: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8c_m6U1f9o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8c_m6U1f9o</a>
 AntiSquid: the onion is the only honest news source
 AntiSquid: wow that audience is so serious JBM
 JBM: innit
 Astrobytes: That's spot on lol
 Amrhossam: i thought about a feature that already exist but tried to implement it in a different way
 Amrhossam: maybe it's implemented wrong and i'd like to enhance it
 Amrhossam: is this okay&#160;?
 Astrobytes: By removing any privacy whatsoever?
 Amrhossam: No
 AntiSquid: ok honestly, at the moment most serious social media site is Minds, but i don't even use that
 Astrobytes: Shame on you. It won't work Amrhossam
 Amrhossam: User will have full control about his content and maybe all the data will be encrypted 
 Amrhossam: so no data selling for adv companies
 Astrobytes: Until the government demands data from you
 Amrhossam: only if you're storing it on a server elsewhere
 Amrhossam: then 
 Amrhossam: you can tell. sorry i can't even access for taht
 Amrhossam: that*
 Amrhossam: i mean, you can encrypt your data even from your gov.
 Astrobytes: Yes, but when they come and break down your door...
 AntiSquid: JBM check out WeChat, politically controlled social media platform used all over china
 Amrhossam: why you're taking the subject to the extreme now :d
 JBM: you can
 Amrhossam: okay here's a question.
 JBM: but are you allowed to?
 Amrhossam: what do you guys think about stories features implemented in both instagram and facebook
 Amrhossam: something is missing from it right 
 Amrhossam: it doesn't feel natural
 AntiSquid: Amrhossam what world do you live in? 
 Amrhossam: @AntiSquid the same world you live in
 AntiSquid: the reason facebook and instagram and other sites work are because they grab the attention of the user and get them addicted, that's what you need to aim for lol
 JBM: prove it
 AntiSquid: then i don't have pink tinted grasses on Amrhossam
 Astrobytes: *rose
 AntiSquid: snapchat is great for teens to pull funny faces and share them 
 Amrhossam: you're right, getting people addicted you have to give them what they didn't know they needed to
 AntiSquid: you need to cater to the dumb and gullible 
 Astrobytes: That's modern capitalism
 AntiSquid: Amrhossam more like convince them they needed your product ...
 Astrobytes: Sorry, neoliberal economics
 AntiSquid: and make sure the font you use on your website is pretty (learn from Steve Jobs)
 Amrhossam: i see
 Astrobytes: Did you watch the Iron Sky movies yet AntiSquid
 Amrhossam: maybe i'm ambitious, or maybe i'm still naive 
 AntiSquid: is it about nazis on the moon?
 Astrobytes: Naive yes
 Astrobytes: Yes AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: yes years ago, why
 Astrobytes: The 2nd one features a cult that worship Steve Jobs
 AntiSquid: oh
 AntiSquid: well makes sense
 Amrhossam: but even if i'm naive there's still opportunities from ideas right&#160;?
 MSmits: are the nazi's the ones that made the flag seem like it was fake to make people think the moonlanding wasnt real?
 Astrobytes: And Nazis at the centre of the earth
 Astrobytes: And dinosaurs
 AntiSquid: no religion of memes and people praying to lolcat&#160;?
 Amrhossam: i mean this can't be it we are all set and got what we got 
 Astrobytes: No but close
 AntiSquid: well i mean, you could aim for utility based social media
 Astrobytes: That's a good attitude Amrhossam
 AntiSquid: if it's EXTREMELY USEFUL like let's say github then people will use it! 
 AntiSquid: but you stil lend up selling out people, see google
 MSmits: is google worse than facebook?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'd focus on making something useful. But as AntiSquid says.... at some point the investment groups come knocking
 MSmits: facebook aided genocide, pretty hard to top that
 Astrobytes: Is drowning worse than burning MSmits?
 MSmits: i think burning is worse
 MSmits: but I get your point
 MSmits: you're saying you should get both facebook and google so you can put out the fire
 Astrobytes: It depends. Some people drown rather peacefully, others have a reaction which makes them continue to gasp for air
 Astrobytes: lol, if they cancelled each other out that'd be great
 MSmits: personally I dont use any social media. Except this I guess
 AntiSquid: more likely to cooperate
 MSmits: oh and sometimes educational youtube i guess
 AntiSquid: they are there to make money not shut down each other to make people happy
 Astrobytes: I have to use FB to keep in touch with a few stubborn people
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: my wife does that
 AntiSquid: i deleted my facebook although i lost contact with quite a lot of people, i just couldn't stand that site anymore
 MSmits: good
 JBM: what's the fb/genocide story?
 MSmits: google facebook myanmar
 Astrobytes: I use email, discord or whatever to keep in touch. Some people just don't want to lose their FB it seems
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html</a>
 MSmits: facebook had 2 moderators for the entire area
 MSmits: so people just used facebook to gather up and mob moslims, killing them
 AntiSquid: i like discord, no idea about what harm they could do if they wanted to ...
 AntiSquid: but facebook is thought policing people
 MSmits: worse is when they aren't policing at all
 Astrobytes: MSmits I'm sure it's not the only example. I mean (OK it's not genocide) but we have vigilante groups in our town who operate on FB
 MSmits: they just allow fake news to exist
 JBM: i'm not quite clear how i think they're responsible
 JBM: (after a cursory glance)
 JBM: yes, they do
 Astrobytes: JBM, the point was they allowed loads of fake accounts to spread fake news
 MSmits: if you provide a tool for governments to spread false information you're aiding it
 JBM: yeah sure
 MSmits: it's their servers
 AntiSquid: MSmits actually someone told me "die you motherf***" on facebook, unprovoked actually, facebook tells me it doesn't violate their standards, was initially talking about food wtf ...&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Like they do with most countries fake news fake posters
 JBM: i'm not sure how i'd expect them to determine what's fake or not
 Astrobytes: I reported an animal mutilation video on FB once and they said it was allowed
 MSmits: if it's inciting hate and you can't fact check it, remove it
 MSmits: err on the side of caution
 JBM: but caution is censure
 JBM: censorship
 JBM: what's the word
 Astrobytes: Censorship
 JBM: the verb, to censor?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 MSmits: Would you be ok with a news network broadcasting verifiable lies as news?
 JBM: i don't think i ever read it in en
 JBM: nope
 JBM: but they're not a news network
 MSmits: facebook is the only source of news for many people
 Astrobytes: censure is also a word
 AntiSquid: when corporations grow too big their like small countries, ruling over their users
 JBM: yes, that's a problem
 AntiSquid: they're
 JBM: but it's not a problem i can sincerely hold against fb
 MSmits: who would you hold it against?
 JBM: humankind
 AntiSquid: fb should be policed by the US, enforce free speech imo 
 MSmits: that's easy to say
 JBM: well you asked for it
 MSmits: true
 Astrobytes: In the case of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi probably, and the West for allowing it
 JBM: i wouldn't have specifically held it against anyone spontaneously
 JBM: it's just a fact of life
 JBM: an observation
 MSmits: the thing is, servers are actively being maintained
 JBM: humakind is capable of the best, but it's the worst that spreads
 Astrobytes: So true
 MSmits: if as a company your products are being misused for this sort of thing, I think you should be held accountable by the country your company is based in
 MSmits: if you dont respond
 MSmits: they could have just removed all accounts
 JBM: on mere moral grounds?
 MSmits: yes
 JBM: i don't see that working anytime soon
 Amrhossam: it wouldn't make much sense if i asked what utilities do you might think you need right&#160;?
 JBM: Especially in a suit-seeking country as the US
 MSmits: things don't have to be easy to fix, to be worth fixing 
 AntiSquid: Amrhossam this is what true success looks like&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/01/amazon-jeff-bezos-testify-house-antitrust">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/01/amazon-jeff-bezos-testify-house-antitrust</a>
 JBM: but saying "things shoulg be so" doesn't "fix" things
 MSmits: it's mostly a political problem
 AntiSquid: or like this Amrhossam&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-to-testify-before-house-financial-services-committee-on-libra.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-to-testify-before-house-financial-services-committee-on-libra.html</a>
 JBM: how do you make everyone agree to the same set of morals?
 AntiSquid: and there you need to pull a poker face and tell half truths
 MSmits: some things are no-brainers JBM. You don't have to touch the more controversial things
 Astrobytes: "it's mostly a political problem" - whether we like it or not, everything's political
 JBM: i don't think it's that easy
 AntiSquid: Amrhossam try online chat rooms, or whatever, make it easy for people to socialize, simple as that
 MSmits: we have a set of laws don't we? They are based on morals and even though we dont all share the same morals, we share the same laws
 MSmits: within a country that is
 JBM: yes
 Astrobytes: What if the laws are immoral
 JBM: and as for now, they don't force anyone to police news spread by individuals at the other end of the world
 AntiSquid: MSmits for example everyone hates trump, but then people overlook Pelosi promoting to hug chinese people when the outbreak started, imo that's the grey area, although all US politicians are nutjobs
 Astrobytes: Well, it's tricky to get information out of some places
 MSmits: my idea would be to set a limit on views. If a post has x views it has to be fact checked
 JBM: but how do you tell jokes apart from fake news?
 Astrobytes: How would you determine which x is needed?
 JBM: preventing sharing good jokes seems imoral
 MSmits: Astrobytes implementation detail
 JBM: lol
 JBM: famous last words
 MSmits: you could say 10k
 MSmits: or whatever is agreed upon
 AntiSquid: ya easy to trigger someone these days and be called insensitive
 JBM: yeah, ok for a threshold
 Astrobytes: 10k might have laughed at it and thought "what a load of shit"
 JBM: it's the decision problem you need to expand on
 MSmits: i am not talking about talk offending people, just spreading obvious misinformation
 JBM: "obvious"
 MSmits: real world facts
 JBM: you keep using that world
 JBM: typo, but i like it
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it works
 AntiSquid: MSmits what is a fact? the COVID was only considered a pandemic like 2 months after the entire world knew about it
 AntiSquid: before that everyone said it's all good and rosy
 MSmits: it's not actually that black and white AntiSquid
 MSmits: pandemic is a definition
 JBM: we mustn't be in the same circles
 MSmits: but the disease was there and people knew it
 Astrobytes: No actually that's an epidemiological thing, declaring a pandemic
 JBM: i've had charts of wuhan's exponential since early january in my twitter feed
 AntiSquid: yes and the WHO did they spread misinfo or not?
 Astrobytes: No they did not
 JBM: "not that i know"
 AntiSquid: then why did they hate on Taiwan&#160;?
 MSmits: well they were overly positive about China
 Astrobytes: And everyone has had access to data and papers since the end of last year
 AntiSquid: MSmits and that wasn't misguiding at all?
 MSmits: of course it was
 JBM: what's the taiwan hate story?
 AntiSquid: exactly my point
 MSmits: but if you can't factcheck something you dont have to remove it of course
 MSmits: some things are easy to fact check
 AntiSquid: JBM basically taiwan reacted immediately and was called out as "racist/discriminating" 
 AntiSquid: but then we are all in lockdown now so maybe they didn't overreact eh?
 Astrobytes: Chinese COVID-19 death rates not being one of them
 JBM: by the WHO?
 MSmits: if someone starts posting it is a  good idea to drink bleach to cure covid, fact checking isnt a problem
 AntiSquid: yes
 JBM: didn't hear about it at the time
 Astrobytes: Source?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eisQ6RiHhp4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eisQ6RiHhp4</a>
 JBM: barely heard about taiwan tbh, my asia news were shared between "wuhan virus" and "hk protests"
 AntiSquid: well you can look for sources out there
 MSmits: I also saw an interview where China refused to call Taiwan a country or something
 MSmits: sorry
 MSmits: where the who refused
 JBM: that's, like, par for the course
 Astrobytes: Yeah went straight from HK to Wuhan very swiftly
 AntiSquid: and what was that crap in italy about hugging chinese people&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: then the outbreak in italy was pretty much the worst in europe
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNMdg4morQs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNMdg4morQs</a>
 Astrobytes: Dude, we had people in this town refusing to eat from the Chinese takeaway then rushing out to stockpile soy sauce and pasta
 JBM: humankind...
 JBM: and Corona beers tanking in the US
 AntiSquid: ya, but point is why was that promoted at all Astrobytes&#160;?
 JBM: because people "like" it
 AntiSquid: actually i didn't give a damn about the news back then just went out to eat at a chinese place because it was chinese new year
 Astrobytes: It appeals to their sense of blaming 'the other'
 MSmits: honestly, this talk of blaming covid on China is very hypocritical. These same people dont give a sht that China has 1 million people in concentration camps
 MSmits: so much worse
 Astrobytes: The general population can't deal with unknowns
 JBM: let's get them to ooc
 Astrobytes: Always have to find a target to blame
 AntiSquid: it's not about blaming china, it's about the media in the west not being honest
 AntiSquid: it doesn't matter where it came from, maybe next time it comes from elsewhere
 Astrobytes: Since when has the Western media (for the most part) been honest?
 BenjaminUrquhart: this
 JBM: what even *is* "honest"
 BenjaminUrquhart: no stop
 MSmits: I dunno, in my country they are at worst biased towards sensationalism. 
 Astrobytes: Fair JBM
 AntiSquid: point was how can you "control" such dishonesty&#160;? you either get skewed thought policing or you just let everyone speak up their mind
 MSmits: its difficult to navigate AntiSquid
 JBM: and crowds are so dumb
 AntiSquid: was giving an example regarding "control of missinformation"
 MSmits: but either extreme is bad
 Astrobytes: I guess we can call it a rough period in human evolution
 MSmits: and we are on one of the two extremes now
 AntiSquid: difficult to navigate means, either you give everyone same freedom to speak up, or you shut up some in favor of the others
 MSmits: it;s not about who says it, it's about what they say
 AntiSquid: and who's policing it?
 Astrobytes: Yes AntiSquid, on the one hand you need to be able to speak freely, on the other hand how do you manage blatant lies
 AntiSquid: who's watching the watchers&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Corporation bosses mostlyu
 MSmits: I think governments should be a bit more involved in this
 Astrobytes: *mostly
 Astrobytes: Not  the UK govt jeez
 JBM: wishful thinking
 AntiSquid: we go through blatant lies every day, that was my point, in fact you said there's only one reliable source of news Astrobytes, so maybe it's all about people smartening up and not being pampered (protected from blatant lies)
 JBM: [big] govts only get involved as far as their personal agenda goes
 MSmits: AntiSquid that assumes people are intelligent enough to do this, most are not
 JBM: and that's assuming they understand what's going on
 MSmits: this is the biggest failing of democracy also
 JBM: that's a good point
 JBM: EDUCATION
 JBM: vote for more education
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, I'm not disagreeing with you, and I didn't say it was the only source of reliable news, it's one of the only reliable sources of news here in the UK
 MSmits: without education, a dictatorship actually functions better than a democracy
 JBM: *that* changes societies for the better
 AntiSquid: 350 mil to the NHS if brexit happens, lots of people voted just because of that MSmits, next day farage went back on his word lol
 JBM: (that and health)
 AntiSquid: get my point?
 MSmits: I know
 JBM: so that was fake news
 JBM: so it should have been filtered
 JBM: right?
 MSmits: if you dont know it beforehand, you cant filter it
 JBM: you can disprove it
 Astrobytes: yeah, so far, an old war veteran has raised more money (public money) for the NHS than the govt since Brexit
 JBM: fact checkers at fb now must have a PhD in economics
 MSmits: were these the lies on buses btw&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: You all are aware of the Cambridge Analytica involvement in Brexit right? And their ties with Steve Bannon and the Trump campaign?
 AntiSquid: no, just the one campaign bus afaik
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah
 AntiSquid: heard something about it
 MSmits: they sold facebook info
 MSmits: didnt they?
 Astrobytes: The Guardian did a huge exposé over abotu a year AntiSquid, look it up
 Astrobytes: *about
 AntiSquid: proves how powerful data science and ML is&#160;?
 MSmits: definitely is
 MSmits: btw, about the educaton thing. Me and my colleague are also trying to come up with ways to make students more resistant to fake news
 Astrobytes: One of the data scientists involved with Brexit is an assistant to Dominic Cummings, and they both sit in on SAGE meetings AntiSquid
 MSmits: one of the compulsory parts of our CS curriculum is ethics
 AntiSquid: MSmits imo you can't guide people to what's fake and what not and neither should you control how they perceive, i am a bit idealistic here, but everyone should reach their own conclusions and reach the truth that way
 Astrobytes: (SAGE is Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies i nthe UK btw)
 MSmits: you need skills to do this AntiSquid
 JBM: like the people trump fired?
 Astrobytes: Kind of
 MSmits: it's like how some people believe the Nigerian Prince and some do not
 Astrobytes: We also are refusing to publish the results of a grim excercise on a 'flu pandemic from a few years ago that highlighted how unprepared we would be
 Astrobytes: *exercise
 Astrobytes: That's now being legally challenged
 AntiSquid: idk about preparing, i mean did we prepare for floods, it's like jumping straight in ... same with the pandemic, jump in get herd immunity
 MSmits: does it really matter that much though? Isn't the UK split almost as much into political parties as the US is?
 MSmits: truth seems to matter so much less these days&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, the point is that this government focused on austerity, punishing the poor and maximising their profits. Selling everything off, whether building contracts or NHS,  and are now where we are
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/26/uk-coronavirus-response-utterly-hypocritical-says-un-poverty-expert">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/26/uk-coronavirus-response-utterly-hypocritical-says-un-poverty-expert</a>

 MSmits: seems like everything i see and hear about the US, exists in the UK to a lesser degree
 MSmits: still bad
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/26/doctor-sue-results-operation-cygnus">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/26/doctor-sue-results-operation-cygnus</a>
 Astrobytes: Yes, we apparently aim to be (to use a Brexit term) a vassal state of the US. The irony.
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but trump is very unpopular in the UK
 MSmits: except for a few crazies, I think
 Astrobytes: Yet people can't see past the end of their own noses
 MSmits: true
 AntiSquid: interesting, thanks for sharing
 Astrobytes: Deceived in exactly the same way
 MSmits: well, not exactly. I mean I am pretty sure that if you guys had a government that was as bad as the US one, it would be way more unpopular. 
 MSmits: Trump still has over 40% support, which is insane
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid you can usually trace all the stuff in the guardian back to papers, documents etc, that's why I count it as reliable
 Astrobytes: Oh ours is bad MSmits
 AntiSquid: ah i see, good point
 Astrobytes: Just not on the same level internationally, and our PM is not an actual retard
 MSmits: oh, I had another idea!
 MSmits: do you know how, with smoking, companies have to put a label on it
 MSmits: this stuff causes cancer and what not
 Astrobytes: Do we put warnings on textbooks now - May Cause Knowledge?
 MSmits: what if social media were forced to provide links to real news media whenever an algorithm detects something resembling news
 Astrobytes: "real news media" falls victim to it too, that's why
 Astrobytes: *why not
 Astrobytes: There's reliable media, and non-reliable
 MSmits: well it's more controllable and more visible. Even something like Fox news is not as extreme as many others
 MSmits: you simply would not list those
 AntiSquid: MSmits actually cigarettes were advertised as healthy beneficial at some point, so again all about who controls the info
 Astrobytes: ^true
 MSmits: that was due to corruption, when we as a society realized that was not true, we did something about it
 JBM: as was wine here
 AntiSquid: search "Vintage Cigarette Ads Promising Better Health"
 MSmits: I know  about this
 JBM: and radioactivity!
 MSmits: that too
 MSmits: just because mistakes were made in the past, is no reason to stop trying to do your best to fix/prevent more&#160;:)
 JBM: what other crazy thing have we promoted?
 AntiSquid: well facebook is corrupt, if they control "the missinfo" then you see where this is going ...
 Astrobytes: Yeah but MSmits, this was going on in Romania even recently as AntiSquid can probably confirm. I used to work with a Romanian girl who worked for Philip Morris Tobacco and had no clue for years
 MSmits: the coca cola company does this now too
 JBM: sugar
 AntiSquid: i don't watch the news so don't know Astrobytes, i live in UK so i only know about my daily life tbh
 MSmits: they are not allowed in many western countries to spread misinformation about sugar being healthy
 Astrobytes: *recently as in the past decade or 2
 MSmits: so they try it in countries without these laws
 icecream17: huh? I have 2 chat streams....
 JBM: that's the first think i noticed about czechia when i first went there
 JBM: 1) ads all over the landscape
 AntiSquid: i don't remember any cigar ads though Astrobytes
 JBM: 2) about cigarettes and gambling
 Astrobytes: I don't keep up to date with Romanian news either AntiSquid, don't be so touchy
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No it wasn't so much ads, just knowledge, smoking was cool etc
 AntiSquid: ya but that's just culture
 MSmits: ads for smoking on tv are simply illegal here
 JBM: here too
 Astrobytes: "Just culture" is exactly the point though
 JBM: tv or other
 AntiSquid: everyone knows it's bad, they still smoke
 JBM: icecream17: good for you!
 MSmits: yet it helps not to advertise
 AntiSquid: going for a cigar is like going for a coffe
 MSmits: doesnt fix the problem entirely
 Astrobytes: It's changing now, less people are smoking
 JBM: and not legalize making it "cool"
 JBM: dunno about NL, but I do get the feeling many more smoke in DE than FR
 MSmits: going for cigar is not the problem really. It's people smoking more than they're eating
 MSmits: going through the day smoking non stop
 MSmits: they cost the government huge amounts of money too, we all pay for it
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/B3t5116">https://imgur.com/a/B3t5116</a>
 Astrobytes: Nicotine does have appetite supressing properties
 MSmits: lol, restart browser icecream17
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah... nicotine isnt the worst in a cigarette I think
 AntiSquid: is it possible for you to edit out the extra element icecream17&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No it's fine MSmits
 Astrobytes: I actually started vaping again recently
 Astrobytes: I quit smoking 2+ years ago
 MSmits: ohh ok
 AntiSquid: isn't vaping still somewhat bad&#160;? although clearly far less dangerous than smoking
 MSmits: it's probably less regulated because it's not as old
 JBM: i had a swedish doctor tell me chew-nicotine was actually rather good
 JBM: haven't fact-checked yet
 Astrobytes: I don't give a fuck, I suffer with depression and anxiety sometimes and the vaping helps 
 wlesavo: AntiSquid it probably strongly depends on product quality
 Astrobytes: JBM I used to snus all the time
 MSmits: Astrobytes sure, just be careful about the company you buy from, they might not all be trustworthy
 JBM: Astrobytes: so how was your health (and that of the other 99 people in the control group)?
 Astrobytes: I buy nicotine and mix my own flavours with propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine
 Astrobytes: And build my own coils. My vape is just a simple circuit
 MSmits: I'm somehow addicted to cola with no caffeine and no sugar
 JBM: so you like water?
 JBM: we all do, though we wouldn't admit it
 AntiSquid: the flavor i guess
 JBM: flavor is sugar
 JBM: cooked sugar
 JBM: caramel as they say
 MSmits: no, it has artificial sweetener
 Astrobytes: JBM, my health while snus'ing? Great! I used it coming off cigarettes for a while actually
 AntiSquid: aspartane addiction?
 JBM: so you'd recommend it to non-smokers?
 MSmits: if that's a thing, then sure
 Astrobytes: No
 JBM: that's kind of an orange flag
 Astrobytes: Why start tobacco use as a non-user?
 JBM: i dunno
 JBM: people start as non-smokers and do anyway
 JBM: you tell me!
 Astrobytes: There are tobacco free snus portions which I recommend if you like the flavours
 MSmits: after you started, it might not be worth stopping, given the circumstances
 MSmits: as Astrobytes said, if it helps with depression and whatnot...
 JBM: ah, the moneys
 MSmits: but if you never started, it's different
 Astrobytes: I started smoking at 12. Fucking 12 years old.
 JBM: there was that House episode where the solution was to fsckn' start smoking again
 Astrobytes: Took me til I was about 17 to realise it was kinda hard to stop
 MSmits: yeah that wouldnt happen these days i think Astrobytes, not as easily anyway
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 MSmits: btw, I failed at making Bandas early playout, while we were chatting about all this stuff
 Astrobytes: Good thing with vaping is I know I can come off it in a week
 JBM: and i'm failing at catching up on codejam
 JBM: though i do feel like i'm making progres
 MSmits: no i meant, i really did try, it just didnt work :P
 AntiSquid: oh our distraction worked, hi five everyone, we beat MSmits
 AntiSquid: nvm then
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: The codejame problems looked interesting, I took a quick look earlier
 Astrobytes: *codejam
 MSmits: i made masks for counting the pink and blue dudes on various distances from the edge, to get a sensible eval, but couldnt make it work better than my other version
 Astrobytes: Wear a different mask MSmits
 MSmits: :mask:
 AntiSquid: done a smoking cessation "course", to talk to people who wish to stop smoking, first guy i end up talking to says "hey i changed my mind,m i enjoy smoking, thanks for coming by though"
 MSmits: lol wth
 Astrobytes: haha
 Astrobytes: That was me for years
 JBM: yeah, round 1C is usually "doable, please be fast"
 Astrobytes: The day I picked up a vape I gave away my tobacco (I smoke handrolled only) and that was it
 JBM: (as opposed to 1B "pick the problems you'll finish carefully")
 Astrobytes: I need to try and remember to enter it one of these years :P
 MSmits: it's easier to quit smoking when your life gets easier
 Astrobytes: Mine got harder MSmits
 MSmits: my mother wasn't able to stop for like 40 years
 MSmits: but when she retired she could do it
 Astrobytes: So I contest your conjecture
 MSmits: no i meant stop completely
 MSmits: i remember her trying to quit before like 20 yrs ago, it goes well for a month, maybe two, then something bad happens and you start again
 AntiSquid: some people can just stop anytime 
 AntiSquid: or maybe they are stingy&#160;? idk
 MSmits: Astrobytes i dont mean life gets easier when you stop
 MSmits: i mean it's easier to stop when your life is easier
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's genetic I think
 MSmits: some people are more susceptible to Nicotine addiction
 Astrobytes: No MSmits, my life was legit *a lot* harder when I decided to stop!
 MSmits: ahh ok, that might just be you though
 MSmits: doesn't have to be a general thing&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: The vape really worked for me.
 MSmits: generally, I think bad habits are harder to break when you're not feeling too great
 Astrobytes: I tried everything else previously
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's a fair generalisation
 MSmits: yeah, thats maybe a bit like what i did with my cola addiction
 MSmits: I replaced it with non-caffeinated version... 
 MSmits: caffeine was giving me loads of problems
 MSmits: i got hyperventilation and stuff
 Astrobytes: My mum did that. Was addicted to diet coke for years afterwards. With the caffeine tho :P
 Astrobytes: Really? How much were you drinking?
 MSmits: ah, i never did the sugar version
 MSmits: 1 bottle a day
 MSmits: 1,5 L
 Astrobytes: My mum used to get through 6L Diet per day when I was I kid/teen
 MSmits: thats crazy
 Astrobytes: Plus coffee
 MSmits: 6L? How do you even do that
 Astrobytes: Hardly ate
 AntiSquid: and how is she now?
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah yes the coke diet
 Astrobytes: She was always on the move, driving, on flights etc
 Astrobytes: She's alright, high blood pressure but nothing too serious
 MSmits: yeah but still 6L, thats 8 of the biggest cups isnt it?
 Astrobytes: Yeah but it was in small amounts from like 3-4am til midnight
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: well if it's diet, it's mostly caffeine + intestinal problems
 Astrobytes: She doesn't drink soft drinks any more
 MSmits: aspartane will become dangerous after over 30: I think
 Astrobytes: Nor do I
 MSmits: 30L i mean
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: I drink water or fresh orange juice
 MSmits: water is best
 MSmits: orange juice is a bit sugary I think
 Astrobytes: Been a fan of it all my life
 Astrobytes: Yeah don't overdo it on fruit juice
 Astrobytes: I sometimes juice my own fruit and veg
 Astrobytes: We do need sugar as humans you know
 MSmits: ahh, I eat carrots as candy. Other than that no veg and fruit besides what's in the powder I make shakes out of :P
 Astrobytes: Just not too much&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol, heathen
 Astrobytes: Dip those carrots in some nice homemade hummus
 MSmits: the carrots is just to have something to chew occasionally
 MSmits: apparently chewing is a need
 Astrobytes: I have that issue as a vegetarian sometimes
 Astrobytes: "Wow, I used a fork today!"
 MSmits: I would be a vegetarian if I didnt go to a snack bar every 1-2 weeks
 AntiSquid: as opposed to chop sticks?
 MSmits: thats the only time i eat meat
 Astrobytes: Spoons AntiSquid, I eat a lot of rice and dal, and other Indian stuff
 Astrobytes: BUT chopsticks tonight
 Astrobytes: noodles on the menu
 AntiSquid: curry and nut roasts dinners eh?
 Astrobytes: Fuck nut roasts
 AntiSquid: :FD
 Astrobytes: You can have a different veggie meal every day for over a year just by choosing Indian veg dishes from different areas
 Astrobytes: IF you can get the veg
 MSmits: I'm sure that's great, but it sounds horrible to me
 Astrobytes: Foodist!
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: nah, I'm just an extreme fussy eater
 Astrobytes: Hadn't noticed that at all...
 MSmits: that in combination with trying to eat healthy, is why i started doing the shakes
 AntiSquid: thai curry is only curry i really like :p
 MSmits: at least then i wont slowly kill myself :P
 Astrobytes: I love a good Thai curry
 Astrobytes: I have issues cause of fish sauce and shrimp paste but I break my rules sometimes
 Astrobytes: *dried shrimp
 Astrobytes: I still miss some nice meat things, but I don't mind so much because I can cook tasty shit
 MSmits: thats good
 Astrobytes: Not literally shit ofc
 MSmits: I dont judge
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: you know what bothers me sometimes
 MSmits: seeing parents pass their bad habits like smoking/drinking/obesity on to their children
 MSmits: with the excuse: "well i do it, cant forbid them then can i? "
 Astrobytes: Happens alllll the time
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's child abuse

 Astrobytes: MSmits this song is literally about that<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsp8DmgtjHY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsp8DmgtjHY</a>
 MSmits: ah right
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid I've tasted some great stuff, aaaaannnd some really fucking vile shit
 MSmits: so you did taste shit
 AntiSquid: maybe they wanted to mimic the taste of innards&#160;?
 MSmits: again, I dont judge
 Astrobytes: LOL MSmits :D
 Astrobytes: You're supposed to be listening to the Offspring
 MSmits: I think we've all been curious from time to time
 MSmits: there's only so many times you can hear someone say it tastes like shit
 MSmits: and think, am i the only one who doesnt know?
 Astrobytes: Well... I guess there's only one thign for it 
 Astrobytes: *thing
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: Personally, I'm content with imagining
 MSmits: so you're imagining it now
 Astrobytes: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: stupid game
 MSmits: what game
 Astrobytes: fucking daisy tulip bastard thing
 MSmits: oh, i havent started that
 MSmits: seems hard
 Astrobytes: It's 'fun'
 Astrobytes: Trying to come up with a decent eval that's consistent
 Astrobytes: And prune some stuff
 Astrobytes: The codeine tablets aren't helping matters tbh
 MSmits: prune a lot it would seem?
 MSmits: coughing?
 MSmits: or back?
 Astrobytes: On the larger maps yeah
 Astrobytes: Back
 MSmits: ah ok, not getting any better?
 Astrobytes: Docs again on Monday
 Astrobytes: Fucking agony man
 Astrobytes: If I sit up straight and don't move I'm cool, or stand up straight and don't move I'm cool
 MSmits: sucks&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: You see the issue
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: So don't move
 Astrobytes: Tried
 JBM: moving makes you tired
 JBM: you shouldn't do it
 Astrobytes: Unfortunately I cannot just sit in the chair all day and swallow painkillers
 JBM: no
 JBM: you could torture patiente too
 MSmits: it helps if you know exactly what it is and that it's going away on its own
 JBM: and make tv out of it
 Astrobytes: lol JBM
 JBM: you missed your path there pal
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, it's a bit up in the air atm unfortunately
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm not here to moan
 Astrobytes: Honest
 MSmits: thats ok by me, it's not like you do it all day
 MSmits: well not on chat anyway
 JBM: was about to bounce on that ^^
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: Arrr I'm done.
 Astrobytes: Stupid eval/game/universe :P
 reCurse: +1
 JBM: humankind strikes again
 Astrobytes: no JBM, it's the game you see, it's bugged and/or trolling me you see...
 JBM: yes yes
 JBM: i so see
 AntiSquid: the galactic spirit be damned
 Astrobytes: hehe
 Astrobytes: Anyway, think I'll go and supplement my painkillers with a shot or two of palinka and some nooodles
 Astrobytes: Or noodles
 Astrobytes: See you all tomorrow
 AntiSquid: bye
 AntiSquid: gn8
 MSmits: gn all, going to sleep also
 LelouchVC2: :o
 LelouchVC2: Night
 cegprakash: does anyone know a good C++ stl library for matrix multiplications, vector multiplications etc?
 cegprakash: I'm planning to start with NN soon
 ZarthaxX: make it yourself
 ZarthaxX: if you are talking outside CG, use npython with numpy
 cegprakash: if I do it myself it'll be full of bugs
 cegprakash: xD
 LelouchVC2: Worst advice ever, make ur own library!
 cegprakash: but I think for c++ it may be worth it
 cegprakash: while a python guy trains for 1 hour I would train under 10 minutes
 inoryy: that's not how it works
 AntiSquid: lol ZarthaxX response :D
 AntiSquid: why don't you make it for him ZarthaxX&#160;? :p
 LelouchVC2: He would, but he's busy with other libraries!
 PortalBot: he's busy saving the world!
 KiwiTae: its a good exercise though , ZarthaxX good advice
 Amrhossam: join clash
 Amrhossam: now
 Zenoscave: Amrhossam no
 Amrhossam: 
 Amrhossam: what are you doing guys
 Zenoscave: anything but clash
 Amrhossam: follow me on twitter then
 Zenoscave: nope
 Amrhossam: @amrhossam96
 Amrhossam: you said anything
 Amrhossam: stick to your word
 Zenoscave: Anything&#160;!= everything&#160;;)
 Amrhossam: clever
 LelouchVC2: Something with clash of code and leap years
 LelouchVC2: I'll figure it out one day
 romrd468: well  for some reason velocity*1000 for csb works ok
 LelouchVC2: I'm starting to hate this site
 LelouchVC2: Every clash these days seems to have the weirdest prompts that barely describe the problem
 LelouchVC2: And passing all the tests rarely means 100% score anymore
 LelouchVC2: Then Python noobs come in and solve it in half a second with one line. 
 fvla: i do resent some fastest mode prompts
 fvla: that are just 1 line math print statements
 LelouchVC2: And now more predominately ruby coders
 fvla: which language do you use?
 LelouchVC2:&#160;:((
 fvla: you need to use a scripting language
 fvla: you really do on clash of code
 fvla: because c++ doesn't have good text processing out of the box
 fvla: if you don't like that, then stay away from clash
 fvla: and do bot programming and puzzles
 LelouchVC2: C++ has some pretty good string processing which comes in handy
 fvla: i mean, it does
 LelouchVC2: Just usually takes more code and a little more logic
 fvla: exactly
 fvla: you can't do it fast like in python
 LelouchVC2: I'll use a script language when I'm sucking obama's d
 LelouchVC2: Which might be soon
 fvla: format(int(input()), 'b')
 LelouchVC2:&#160;;-;
 fvla: take 1 line of single integer input and convert it to 0s and 1s
 fvla: python
 fvla: it's not just "a little more logic" in c++
 fvla: and don't suck obama's d
 fvla: but don't be too stubborn either
 fvla: python is great for prototyping
 fvla: i don't know about ruby, but that's just because i never needed to use it
 fvla: perl is also better at some tasks, but if you want maintainable code, stick to python
 fvla: javascript is more like c++ and java, but a scripting language...and i have a personal vendetta against it, but it's used too many places to not use it...
 fvla: but learn python/ruby/javascript, then use it for quick prototyping
 LelouchVC2: *shudders*
 LelouchVC2: I went through crash courses on python/javascript - didn't like either&#160;:/ Can use them but I'd be looking up documentation all the time
 fvla: what, you don't look up documentation for C++ all the time?
 LelouchVC2: Not really
 fvla: i mean, once you get used to python
 fvla: you won't be looking up too much
 fvla: i think
 LelouchVC2: I suppose, I'll get to it during the summer I guess&#160;:((
 LelouchVC2: "i think" ~ Proofs Math Professor
 fvla: don't learn it for the sake of clash, though
 fvla: learn it for the sake of writing useful programs fast
 LelouchVC2: Lol, no worries, just good to have a quick and dirty language handy
 LelouchVC2: yeee &lt;3
 fvla: pytorch, for instance, which is better than tensorflow
 fvla: and i use python for file processing often
 LelouchVC2: Yea, well I'll see how Python goes
 LelouchVC2: I wanna do C# when I get the chance *slurp*
 fvla: :thumbsup:
 LelouchVC2: I messed around with it for a small program, was nice to use. C++ but easier
 LelouchVC2: well im outta here 
 LelouchVC2: thanks for the talk &lt;3
 fvla: np
 KiwiTae: LelouchVC2 c# is like java
 BenjaminUrquhart: I mean, yes but actually no
 BenjaminUrquhart: that took wayyy too long to send

 Astrobytes: gg jacek, I'm impressed. What did you change?
 jacek: last iteration i fixed my move pool and added tree reuse
 Astrobytes: It seems to be working! 
 Astrobytes: good score too, think you can improve it?
 jacek: if I learn AVX stuff for my eval
 Astrobytes: ah, have fun with that&#160;:)
 baobigbang: how to learn more about backend python?

 mr.fish: i fuck for $1
 YCS-Venom: for one hour?
 YCS-Venom: Can you explain mr.fish
 tomatoes: boolean?

 k4ng0u: anyone has tips on how to make simulations faster on othello? I currently use 64bits bitboards (one for me, one for opp) but it's still really slow.It's likely that the way i compute the next move is really suboptimal  (iteration on every cell in all directions until I find a move)
 MSmits: k4ng0u use this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hanshq.net/othello.html">https://www.hanshq.net/othello.html</a>
 MSmits: was shared on this chat before by RoboStac
 MSmits: you can make it even faster using SIMD instructions, but this is already quite fast
 Astrobytes: Hey MSmits, donno if you fixed it but your bot was printing a9 again last night
 MSmits: oh really
 MSmits: never fixed it then lol
 MSmits: I've given up on my eval for now. I need to find a way to automatically tune weights
 MSmits: like TD or coevolutionary learning
 MSmits: can also use that for other multis
 tomatoes: 8x8 is not enough
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: hehe
 k4ng0u: thanks MSmits, I think "Storing the disks in bitboards is memory efficient, but it's nothing more than a cute trick unless we can operate on them efficiently" is a good summary of why my bot is performing quite poorly despite using bitboards :D
 MSmits: yeah thats true
 MSmits: though, if you're doing mcts or similar, you can store the board on the node if it is small
 MSmits: so it helps even if your move generation sucks
 tomatoes: i stuck on training too :slight_smile:
 MSmits: yeah, I get the gist of both TD and coevolutionary training, but I need a good example really
 MSmits: i dont want to spend the time to figure it out all on my own
 MSmits: oh btw Astrobytes I found a way to cheaply calculate disk stability, but then it didn't improve my bot at all
 Astrobytes: I've got my offline runner ready, and that's about it lol
 Astrobytes: Oh really MSmits?
 Astrobytes: I thought stability would be important
 MSmits: so far the only thing that i've seen work for my bot were mobility, C and X corners
 MSmits: yeah, it even solves games slightly sooner
 MSmits: because when you have 32 stable disks you win
 MSmits: 33 that is
 Astrobytes: Hm yes, that's true
 MSmits: so it should work, but who knows, maybe it's being hurt by a different parameter that is too low or high
 MSmits: thats why i need TD or similar
 Astrobytes: Oware all over again
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: Wonder if a GA would be any good for tuning
 MSmits: thats basically coevolutionary learning
 MSmits: but I've never done a GA either
 Astrobytes: Yeah, sorry, just thinking aloud
 MSmits: i've skimmed through a lot of papers
 MSmits: seemed TD was able to train an Othello bot more narrowly, performing well against strong bots
 MSmits: GA was more versatile, making bots that destroy weaker bots, but performs somewhat worse against strong bots
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 MSmits: its not that strange i think if you consider how the process goes
 MSmits: TD can be vulnerable to overtraining I think
 Astrobytes: GA also vulnerable to overfitting
 Astrobytes: Anyway, gotta go for now, bbl
 MSmits: cya Astrobytes
 icecream17: people are spawning at the same place i am <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/477501683">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/477501683</a>
 MSmits: they use the same heuristics as you do
 eulerscheZahl: you found the annoying part of platinum rift
 eulerscheZahl: there are some ways to counter this. but only by chance, depending on your opponents it might be worse
 eulerscheZahl: like spawn in 2nd turn or spawn at 1 continent only
 eulerscheZahl: some even take the antarctica and hope for a 2nd place in 4 player matches
 icecream17: all of those strategies sound very interesting...
 icecream17: Ok i got a pesudorandom generator, but i don't know what to do with these numbers: (sample) [551568, -54194, 1, -2606272, 624, 13182, -8, -1791432, 25492589328]
 nitekat: strange... on one CoC I pass all the tests but get 0% after I submit the result... don't get it...
 thanhhv317: hi
 thanhhv317: i am Thanh
 tomatoes: what was your plans about random generator?
 thanhhv317: am using JS, with nodejs, react js and mongo i am becoming a fullstack developer
 MSmits: I'm not even halfstacked
 icecream17: spawn in places with maxplatinum but messed-up-ish randomly
 MSmits: but hi
 icecream17: i had an idea to detect "sections"
 Washier: short stacked myself 
 MSmits: I think I'm bytestacked
 Washier: haha
 Astrobytes: My stack overflows
 Washier: cant beat that
 Washier: is that a good thing stro?
 Washier: *Astro
 Astrobytes: Sometimes? :D
 Astrobytes: I quite like stro, like 'stro
 Washier: yes. me too. thats how nicknames are created&#160;:)
 Washier: 'stro
 Astrobytes: Got a good ring to it
 Washier: what's the cat's name?
 Astrobytes: Gizmo
 MSmits: cool
 Washier: ah, had a Gizmo once. was awesome
 Astrobytes: She has a big chin, makes her look just like Gizmo from Gremlins
 eulerscheZahl: like Gizmo from wechall
 Astrobytes: lol, every time
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 eulerscheZahl: am i the only one mentioning that?
 Astrobytes: Yup!
 Washier: no idea what that is
 MSmits: i only know the gremlins reference
 eulerscheZahl: i guess wechall isn't that popular after all
 Washier: mee too
 Astrobytes: For the uninitiated:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.wechall.net/">https://www.wechall.net/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.wechall.net/profile/Gizmore">http://www.wechall.net/profile/Gizmore</a>oh, it's not even gizmo :D
 Astrobytes: Just noticed that
 Astrobytes: Close enough, I always read it as Gizmo

 MSmits: Astrobytes I think I fixed my A9 error
 Astrobytes: When 'Defend the Web' was hackthis.co.uk I won a t-shirt
 Astrobytes: Years and years ago
 Astrobytes: What was it this time MSmits?
 MSmits: i was reusing the tree while checking whether the boards for p1 and p2 are the same, forgetting that the player that is next to move is also a factor
 MSmits: with passes that will screw things up
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed. And I believe passes were involved when I saw it happen
 Astrobytes: Yes Washier
 MSmits: my bot is in the ballpark with rank 2-4 now I think... I simply added all features I could think off, gave them a weight and it worked somehow. Turned everything back on :P
 Washier: talent.
 Astrobytes: Nice
 Washier: when i try to do that it doesnt work that well&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Did you see jacek's Oware?
 MSmits: yeah, it's a NN?
 Astrobytes: Not 100% sure what it is, some hybrid thing
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: I really need to figure out a way to auto-fit weights
 MSmits: no more of that cg bench :poop:
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: it would be cool if i  could create a program where I feed it a bot with arguments for current weights and it starts training and changing those weights
 MSmits: it could even be arena-less
 MSmits: because all my bots have a solver
 MSmits: so i dont need the referee
 Washier: GA
 MSmits: mmh not a GA in the usual sense I think
 MSmits: a GA usually has a fixed scoring system for a solution
 MSmits: my bot will just lose, draw or win some number of times
 MSmits: the opponents will vary as well
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-othello-1/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-othello-1/msmits</a>
 MSmits: nice submit right? jacek is beating me hard, but otherwise it's cool
 Washier: solid
 Astrobytes: good job man
 tomatoes: :fire:
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Hanifu: nice
 Scarfield: For each weight run N sims 3 times with different values. Assume the winrate is 2nd order polynomium with respect to the weight value, solve for "optimum" weight value. repeat for next weight. Or something like this approach could work i suppose
 MSmits: thats what i've been doing for 2 years
 MSmits: more or less
 MSmits: but i run against CG bench players. Even though i pick several, I end up overfitting
 MSmits: usually I pick 4 opponents around my rating, one or two of which are stronger and i simply take the global winrate as the score
 jacek: yes, for oware its jacekmax and MLP
 Washier: multi layer perceptron?
 jacek: :horse:
 Washier: so NN&#160;:)
 jacek: yes, NN
 Scarfield: if you are using a prune array, it should be JaCegMax
 Washier: noice
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Hi Prunefield
 Scarfield: hello, but heading off again, noobs in CS needs owning
 Scarfield: 'stroBytes :p
 Washier: haha. 'stro
 karliso: How does NN work? Is it like large lookup array with multiple inputs?
 MSmits: NN in general karliso?
 karliso: In context of CG
 jacek: in my context i use it for eval
 karliso: So it is like precumputed eval function
 MSmits: mmh  kinda
 Washier: yes, but trained.
 jacek: somewhat
 MSmits: a NN is basically a giant function with thousands of parameters
 Washier: true
 karliso: But suppose i have 8 inputs... with 8 values... [8][8][8][8][8].. it gets large very fast.
 MSmits: it's not a lookup array
 karliso: So how do you retrieve value?
 jacek: imagine chess. and evaluation function which takes material into consideration. so youre summing pawns * weight1 + rooks * weight2 + queens * weights3 etc.
 MSmits: there's layers of nodes and each layer of nodes is connected to the next
 MSmits: until you get to output layer
 jacek: your input is number of your pawns and enenmy pawns, you multiply by weights and get the result
 MSmits: the multilayered approach makes the network able to encode higher dimensional patterns
 MSmits: similar to ntuples, but it could be anything
 jacek: in NN you have hidden layer, which would take the results, scramble them more and give output
 jacek: and hidden layer could see some more interactions between pawns and give better eval
 MSmits: karliso you should really watch some introductory videos, it's not easy for us to explain it here
 karliso: I have watched about NN, was a while back.
 AntiSquid: i question my own time investment after reading chat&#160;:/
 MSmits: how so AntiSquid?
 icecream17: Example NN:
 icecream17: Input 5
 icecream17: Node 1: 5 * weight + bias = 2
 karliso: How do you train NN?
 MSmits: you play tons of games
 MSmits: the results are backpropagated along the network
 Washier: also fancy math called backprop
 MSmits: adjusting the weights
 MSmits: its not like backpropagation of mcts though
 MSmits: it uses gradient descent
 AntiSquid: look up any tutorial vids karliso
 karliso: So you use referee to play games?
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but create your own ofc
 AntiSquid: well depends how you wanna train it
 karliso: Your own referee?
 Washier: you can also evolve NN's&#160;:)
 MSmits: you've never made your own copy of a simple arena for a game?
 MSmits: not even uttt?
 AntiSquid: wdym evolve
 Washier: yes, karliso you are the utt champ&#160;:)
 karliso: I did for hypersonic... but then i realized someone had already programmed the thing.
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: so you use  a java referee for uttt?
 karliso: yes...
 jacek: w00t
 MSmits: oh thats fine ofc, it's not really the bottleneck anyway
 AntiSquid: MSmits i mean look how easily he ranks higher, then asks questions about more complicated stuff (not first time it happens) ... clearly i fked up somewhere :p
 MSmits: it's just so simple to code a uttt game
 Washier: use the NN as the eval. GA's work by evolving a solution, that means crossing over and mutating the population continiously. Survival of the fittest. you play the population against each other to rank
 Washier: takes time.
 inoryy: did someone say NN?
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's because I only learn what I think I need and then I leave out a lot of stuff that is generally assumed common knowledge
 MSmits: oh you mean karliso
 Nanosplitter: Is there a good reason no one has made a chess competition on CG?
 MSmits: yes he does this too, maybe more so
 MSmits: Washier isnt this coevolutionary learning?
 Astrobytes: inoryy has been awoken from his slumber
 MSmits: because that may be what I need to learn about
 karliso: But even if NN is good it may not be the best approach in CG due to code size.. right?
 AntiSquid: i think thats called ensamble, personally would have thought a self modifying NN is evolving ... Washier
 MSmits: in some cases that's true karliso
 MSmits: the simpler the game the easier it is to train a bot and the more easily it fits into codesize
 MSmits: train a NN i mean
 AntiSquid: Nanosplitter people afraid of precomputed moves
 MSmits: remember that the codesize limit is also an advantage in that you're forced to train simpler NN's and it makes sure you dont need to rent TPU's to even train them&#160;:)
 inoryy: Astrobytes :D
 Nanosplitter: My NN is bronze in UTTT, but that could just be because I didn't do a good job training  it
 MSmits: Nanosplitter currently there are no top-NN's in uttt
 Nanosplitter: AntiSquid what if I used the 
 inoryy: MSmits TPUs aren't actually the biggest in terms of model size capacity
 Nanosplitter: bumped enter lol
 MSmits: i'm just throwing out fancy words inporry
 MSmits: inoryy
 jacek: why maths in backprop is so complicated
 AntiSquid: NN best approach, just need to squeeze it in after you figure out best model ...
 Nanosplitter: Really Bad Chess (an app) strategy, of randomizing the chess pieces in their staring pos
 jacek: why do they use derivatives and whatnot, when in code its just simple loops and additions
 MSmits: it doesnt seem complicated. Coding it effectively seems more so
 karliso: My uttt codesize is close to 100K and I even got rid of opening book.
 MSmits: how does that happen karliso?
 Washier: Backprop is not the same as evolving. Evolving it means you're searching randomly, backprop means you're training it against a ground truth. 
 MSmits: large variable names? I have less than 1k lines
 Nanosplitter: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.reallybadchess.com/">http://www.reallybadchess.com/</a>
 inoryy: you're mixing something up, Washier
 karliso: 3700 lines
 MSmits: how is that possible karliso, what did you put in that bot?
 MSmits: my bot is considered large at 1k
 karliso: I guess some parts of the code have evolved in great detail.
 AntiSquid: jacek "because a formula is easier to read and understand at a glance" 
 MSmits: they must have karliso
 Astrobytes: that Really Bad Chess is like Fischer Random++
 tomatoes: 1127
 Nanosplitter: Yeah, does that seem feasible for CG?
 Nanosplitter: Removes precomputed moves
 Astrobytes: I think so. struct was considering doing Fischer Random and regular, this would be pretty cool I think
 Astrobytes: But he's busy at the moment
 Nanosplitter: I'm just worried that I can't gaurentee each board would be 100% fair
 AntiSquid: but why not have real chess on CG&#160;? alpha zero plays differently from the other bots and wins
 Astrobytes: Well, limits could be set I guess
 MSmits: isnt chess too complicated to use alphazero on within CG limits
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid struct was gonna do real and variant chess
 MSmits: I doubt it will work
 MSmits: I think a ab-bot will win
 MSmits: with strong openings and such
 AntiSquid: struct slacking? give him more tasks
 Washier: if the eval is good certainly?
 Astrobytes: He's working on something rn
 Astrobytes: So wouldn't be for a while yet
 Nanosplitter: MSmits Would it still win if you did the really bad chess style?
 Nanosplitter: If you can't preset openings
 MSmits: same problem for anyone
 Washier: haha
 Nanosplitter: You guys think I should try and make a really bad chess game for CG?
 icecream17: that's a great idea
 MSmits: maybe have a real chess first and see how well it works within the CG framework?
 MSmits: or do this first
 MSmits: before struct makes his
 MSmits: if it fails, its a waste of effort for 2 people otherwise, that would be sad
 Nanosplitter: So do really bad chess first?
 AntiSquid: do chess and eliminate the castle move to piss off the chess enthusiasts
 MSmits: it could be good to learn from one game before doing the next
 Washier: AntiSquid haha
 icecream17: maybe chess where you try to lose
 Nanosplitter: Ooooo
 MSmits: it's going to be different anyway, you need to have some way to resolve end games
 icecream17: there are so many endgames
 MSmits: it might not be a bad idea to put an endgame database into the referee
 MSmits: to resolve games at turn x
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://syzygy-tables.info/">https://syzygy-tables.info/</a>
 MSmits: with a point system to deal with endgames not in the db
 inoryy: if you don't win by X turn both players lose
 MSmits: or draw?
 inoryy: that's too easy
 Nanosplitter: I mean like you can do the rule of if no captures have been made in 50 turns it's a draw 
 Nanosplitter: Or both lose
 MSmits: whatever works
 inoryy: both players win! non zero-sum chess
 MSmits: lol
 Nanosplitter: Hahaha
 icecream17: chess but the goal is to checkmate the queen
 icecream17: nah... the king should be somewhat limited
 icecream17: chess (but goal is some arbitrary thing)
 Nanosplitter: Could limit the turns to like 70, and if the game isn't over by then it's a draw
 Nanosplitter: Force agressive plays
 icecream17: maybe the goal should be to get all your pieces on the other side of the board
 AntiSquid: in the row of captured pieces
 AntiSquid: i dont think forcing draws is a good idea, a lot of competitive players force a draw&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: Nanosplitter
 inoryy: just call it pro chess
 AntiSquid: how do you find london inoryy? had a chance for sightseeing?
 Nanosplitter: How would you suggest resolving a long game AntiSquid?
 inoryy: actually the other way, avoiding people even more now, I'm afraid it was too early to open up pubs and a second wave is coming
 AntiSquid: i dont know, im wondering myself how to make games have less turns for CG, a lot won't work Nanosplitter
 icecream17: Flip the board upside down. Now pawns that never moved are almost gonna promote!
 Astrobytes: I think we're gonna be in for it heading into the later part of the year inoryy
 inoryy: yeah, at this point I'm starting to mentally prepare for the possibility that my first year in UK will be entirely in (self-)isolation
 Astrobytes: What a welcome eh. Your moving here really was the epitome of bad timing
 Washier: good luck. 
 AntiSquid: more interesting is one of the possible cures
 inoryy: funny thing is that if I had my start date set to a couple of months later I could've just stayed in Estonia, work remotely, and be pretty much free of concern by now (life is back to normal, number of cases is in single digits now)
 inoryy: oh well
 AntiSquid: Hydroxychloroquine - got forcefully pushed aside with fabricated data, really odd huh
 inoryy: fabricated?
 AntiSquid: are you gonna do remote work from estonia?
 AntiSquid: yes 
 omer-chetin: show your code
 omer-chetin: pls
 inoryy: no, I'm stuck in UK now
 inoryy: I think you're mixing up your sources on hydroxychloroquine -- it was forcefully pushed with fabricated data by trump et al and then set aside when evidence piled up that it has no or negative effects
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tropmedres.ac/news/uk-regulator-gives-green-light-to-clinical-trial-of-hydroxychloroquine-to-prevent-covid-19-in-healthcare-workers">https://www.tropmedres.ac/news/uk-regulator-gives-green-light-to-clinical-trial-of-hydroxychloroquine-to-prevent-covid-19-in-healthcare-workers</a>

 inoryy: the "retracted" part isn't a giveaway?
 AntiSquid: im sure i didnt mix up what i said, didnt follow the new btw
 AntiSquid: news *
 AntiSquid: well its going to be trialed basically, see first link
 Astrobytes: "But The Lancet paper was based on fabricated data" - No, Surgisphere refused to allow access to it's databases due to violation of client agreements
 Astrobytes: *Databases and related information
 Astrobytes: Since the data could then not be verified, the authors withdrew the paper. Wording matters a lot.
 Astrobytes: But yes, the trials will go ahead. That does not mean it works.
 AntiSquid: only said possible
 AntiSquid: what i thought is odd is this situation, everything needs to tried
 AntiSquid: but i get what you are saying, still weird, youd think therd be more concern of how it affects the entire world
 Astrobytes: Of course, but the initial study was bad, then Trump opened his gob - call that reliable?
 AntiSquid: i dont watch trump news 
 MSmits: they have actual working medicines...
 MSmits: anti-viral
 Astrobytes: Doesn't even matter, the initial study was bollocks. I don't think anything will come of the trials but hey, we'll see
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir">https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir</a>
 MSmits: the thing is, if something works, it's usually not that hard to prove
 MSmits: if it barely rises above noise level, it probably doesnt work
 Astrobytes: Yes, it doesn't work unless the patient's hospitalised, even then 'all' it does is speed up recovery (that's great, but it's not a cure)
 MSmits: if they could find a cure for it, they would have found a cure for the  "common cold' already, because that is what it is related to
 Astrobytes: Yes, in that it's caused by a coronavirus yep
 Astrobytes: Oh and dexamethasone (a steroid) is also helping reduce mortality rate in hospitalised patients too, which is cool
 Astrobytes: Well, ventilated patients at least
 MSmits: yeah that helps
 MSmits: would be better if people would just forego their own comfort and wear masks where they are told to
 Astrobytes: Tell me about it, so many idiots around
 AntiSquid: ah yeah, and i think you were saying you are not a virologist Astrobytes, but seems youre up to date
 MSmits: anyone with a biological background would dive into this I guess
 Astrobytes: I did a specialised cell biology course a few years back just for fun, it does interest me
 Astrobytes: I'm not bang-up-to-date with reading the latest papers yet, I'll get around to it

 icecream17: i'm amazed
 icecream17: oh. yeah
 icecream17: i'm better than the boss!
 icecream17: hmm. platinum rift 2
 icecream17: whoa that looks totally different
 Astrobytes: Well done
 Astrobytes: Yeah, quite different
 Astrobytes: 2 appealed to me more than 1 I have to say, will give 1 a shot at some point
 icecream17: Whoa! the autocompleted code for javascript is... exactly how i would do it
 AntiSquid: JS best language
 icecream17: i don't know enough languages to know if thats true
 AntiSquid: the best one is always the one you like the most, regardless what others say, trust me icecream17
 jacek: D?
 AntiSquid: is a nice language, not the best, but still nice, i like it and i don't listen to haters
 Astrobytes: Like most langs, D has it's place. Just gets meme'd to death on here 'cause of the zealots
 AntiSquid: still waiting for next CG contest to code in D and output: you are getting wrecked by best language
 Astrobytes: how's the ML coming along AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: i am doing it on and off
 MSmits: wax on, wax off
 Astrobytes: Still on Kaggle I guess?
 AntiSquid: on an emotional level it hurts just as much MSmits
 MSmits: :sad:
 AntiSquid: well i've done a few attempts on AIcrowd
 AntiSquid: and failed to even get started on a challenge for hackerearth
 MSmits: when did you start doing ML?:
 Astrobytes: I haven't seen the hackerearth stuff
 AntiSquid: well i didn't really start, i just do it to fill up my free time with something that seems to be meaningful
 AntiSquid: i learn a few things then move on to something else when i feel a bit bored
 MSmits: oh ok, just like everyone else then
 Astrobytes: *+ purposeful
 AntiSquid: well i did apply it so not really like everyone else :p
 MSmits: hmm right
 AntiSquid: first serious attempt at NN i started early 2019 from what i remember
 MSmits: was that around when rec urse got into it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Gone back to XR yet?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: well astrobytes hackerearth has some ML challenge, but you need to build your own stuff from scratch
 MSmits: do you have to share everything you use? Including training programs and such?
 Astrobytes: Bit of a step-up from Kaggle and such then
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: it goes something like this:kaggle&#160;: gives you extra wheels, crutches, wheelchairs, anything you want, even during contests there's people sharing knowledge and codeaicrowd: you get the starting code and it's often full of bugs and you need to adjust it to your own requirements
 AntiSquid: hackerearth: this is the problem, upload the solution
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 MSmits: ok so no need for it to even be ML?
 AntiSquid: MSmits you don't need to share anything, not sure what you mean
 AntiSquid: obv they can look at your solution MSmits
 MSmits: yes, but if we have a solution here on a contest, it is pretty much the whole thing
 MSmits: if you train a NN offline, then the solution is just a bunch of weights
 AntiSquid: on aicrowd you can avoid ML, but there's prizes reserved for ML first and foremost even if it's mixed ML + something else
 MSmits: a big part of a NN is how you trained it
 MSmits: I would not be surprised if some contests would require you to also share that part
 AntiSquid: well from what i see it's just kaggle that factors in the pretrained part, the others take your model and run it in their environment + add extra "validators" (extra data / environments / etc)
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: btw I am testing my bot vs top othello bots now. CG bench
 MSmits: 22:16:20,883 INFO   Temporary results for othello.cpp (ETA&#160;: 23 minutes)&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68139fb3-cf07-4751-b447-c212e357afbe">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68139fb3-cf07-4751-b447-c212e357afbe</a>
 AntiSquid: in some contests your code is shared if you are top 3 - 5&#160;? (aicrowd) apart from that i didn't see sharing with the general public as a requirement
 MSmits: check out the 70-0 vs dbdr :P
 AntiSquid: so what does dbdr use
 MSmits: ab with all the enhancements and an eval that focuses on specific board features
 MSmits: thats what I understood anyway
 MSmits: like 300k weights
 MSmits: (packed)
 MSmits: probably similar to ntuples
 Astrobytes: ooof
 Astrobytes: he uses ab with mpc
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but also many weights, so there has to be something else
 Astrobytes: multi probcut
 AntiSquid: what's the mpc part?
 MSmits: its a pruning method
 Astrobytes: You do that offline, hence the weights
 MSmits: prune parts of the tree that are probably :poop:
 AntiSquid: see this is where CG is getting closer to kaggle-like stuff ... :p
 MSmits: oh really, it's the MPC that requires so many weights?
 Astrobytes: yes, it's multiple linear regression essentially
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: so it's not even an eval?
 MSmits: just a pruning strategy?
 Astrobytes: Unless he's doing something else then yes
 Astrobytes: clue's in the name
 MSmits: crazy
 MSmits: well it works really well. I think I can beat everyone else if they keep their bot the same and I spend enough time fitting weights, but I dont think I'll get anywhere near dbdr
 Astrobytes: It's very effective for Othello
 Astrobytes: Was developed for/using it iirc
 MSmits: yeah I read that
 MSmits: the best bots also use the ntuples thing though
 Astrobytes: Also very effective yeah
 MSmits: or at least an eval based on specific cell configurations
 Astrobytes: Pretty nice
 Astrobytes: Some use multiple approaches at different stages
 MSmits: yes Edax is nuts
 MSmits: different eval at every ply
 AntiSquid: edax?
 MSmits: open source othello bot
 MSmits: go steal some code if you want
 MSmits: i can't use most of it for my bot
 AntiSquid: i feel out of the loop here now&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Didn't look at the edax source, anything nice?
 MSmits: everything you can think of basically
 MSmits: except mcts
 jacek: there are mmx and avx versions too
 Astrobytes: Noted
 MSmits: yeah I took the stable disks  code from there
 MSmits: not anything else though
 Astrobytes: oh cool, was it how we thought?
 jacek: is it fast and/or accurate?
 MSmits: it's accurate and fast yes
 MSmits: didnt help my bot much so far
 MSmits: but i solve a bit sooner
 Astrobytes: as in was it similar to move resolution
 MSmits: well some part of it
 MSmits: it's really complicated though, somewhat recursive
 MSmits: and uses lookups
 MSmits: the way i did with oware
 Astrobytes: Oh ok
 MSmits: it looks up board lines 
 MSmits: edges i think
 Astrobytes: Yeah that would make sense
 jacek: like ntuple without the weights part
 MSmits: whats that jacek
 Astrobytes: adjacent stable discs from corners going outwards essentially
 MSmits: without the weightS?
 jacek: like lookup table
 jacek: 8x1 edge -&gt; number of stable discs
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah, i had an algo for that, but it didnt avx very well unless i did multiple boards at once
 MSmits: jacek ah yes
 Astrobytes: yup, that figures
 MSmits: I do this in a lot of games, yavalath and oware spring first to mind
 MSmits: uttt as well
 MSmits: with all eval features I can think of I am still using over 1 million nodes per turn. My bottleneck really is not my rollout count
 MSmits: it kills me that robo eva;s 3k nodes per turn lol
 AntiSquid: question then is how does he select them?
 MSmits: it's probably another alphazero
 AntiSquid: he might be analyze them much better
 AntiSquid: aha
 MSmits: so it's node value + policy
 Astrobytes: It is, he said so the other day
 Astrobytes: (unless I'm mistaken, but I'm pretty sure)
 MSmits: but it's not an i-win button for sure. Robo always does well with it, but rarely stays at nr 1 with it
 Astrobytes: yep
 MSmits: thats because of CG limitations I think
 Astrobytes: Possibly
 jacek: or maybe hes noob
 Astrobytes: Would be interesting to see these bots playing outside of CG constraints
 MSmits: he's not an expert at it, but azero is very well documented. He's a great coder afaik, so he can follow those
 AntiSquid: fight him in clash of code jacek, will see who is noob
 Astrobytes: Together I mean
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: what if I take a weight
 MSmits: say this is the weight at ply 22
 MSmits: then apply a gradient
 MSmits: with positive addition at higher plies
 MSmits: or negatieve
 MSmits: so it's 100 at 22
 MSmits: 95 at 21, 105 at 23
 MSmits: weight dependent on ply
 MSmits: linearly as game progresses
 MSmits: that might be good for othello no?
 jacek: game stage interpolation?
 AntiSquid: why not consider 2 weights and that give the value combined based on different factors instead? 
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: so you can have a more accurate function
 MSmits: AntiSquid I already have all the general factors (not based on patterns)
 MSmits: that's like 8 features
 MSmits: but they are game stage dependent
 MSmits: well I could add disc count
 MSmits: dont have that yet
 MSmits: this is definitely game stage dependent
 Astrobytes: played around with negative disc count, well difference
 MSmits: how did that go?:
 MSmits: it's a very cheap eval
 MSmits: only reason to leave it out is probably if the weight is near or at 0
 Astrobytes: promising sometimes, dependent on the other params though (quel surprise)
 Astrobytes: *quelle
 AntiSquid: disc count isn't best measure of board strength though, doesn't that add noise to your eval?
 MSmits: if it did, it would fit to weight = 0
 Astrobytes: negative disc count
 MSmits: then you'd leave it out
 Astrobytes: The fewer discs you have during the game usually is a good thing
 MSmits: except at the end, but then you're solving anyway
 Astrobytes: Well yeah
 AntiSquid: i always aim for corners when i play it myself
 MSmits: thats why my corner weight is huge
 Astrobytes: Yep, that and being careful with the X and C squares ofc
 AntiSquid: corners, then edges, then 2 spaces distance from edge ... i try to avoid the line inbetween edge and middle
 MSmits: line?
 AntiSquid: but even there it depends ... because sometimes there are safe captures
 MSmits: how do you recognize a safe capture?
 Astrobytes: High mobility/less frontiers and vice versa for your opponent
 Astrobytes: Quiet
 MSmits: i have frontiers in there too
 AntiSquid: ya not sure how i would put it in code, but there are instances where you can capture without risk of having your piece closest to edge/corner captured afterwards
 MSmits: very low weight
 MSmits: put them back in just to see if i can have a weight other than 0
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: so you've played othello seriously? Or at least a reasonable amount?
 AntiSquid: just "reasonable" amount online for fun
 MSmits: against players or AI?
 AntiSquid: enough to notice some "hard AI"s out there have flaws :p
 AntiSquid: players too
 Astrobytes: I've played irl, you can't have beers playing it let me tell you
 MSmits: too much disc swapping?
 Astrobytes: *when you're playing it
 MSmits: flipping
 Astrobytes: You need your wits about you to flip the right ones lol
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Astrobytes: It's a good one to play in the afternoon outside when the weather is nice or inside otherwise
 Astrobytes: For me at least
 Astrobytes: And less angry than enraging my friends playing Yavalath on my whiteboard whilst tipsy
 MSmits: you should order a real yavalath board
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I really should tbh
 MSmits: also why do your friends get angry?
 MSmits: cuz you always win?
 Astrobytes: Not always that, perhaps just me forcing them to play at inappropriate times? :D
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: "Go on, just a quick game or three"
 MSmits: it's a great game for human gameplay I think
 MSmits: ok for AI, but specifically for humans
 Astrobytes: It really is
 Astrobytes: Aha
 Astrobytes: Great bug
 MSmits: kill it!
 Astrobytes: My masks are flipped
 Astrobytes: ffs
 MSmits: well you can fix that easily
 Astrobytes: yes, but I've been altering lots of other things to fix the 'bug'
 MSmits: ahh I know that feeling
 Astrobytes: Meh. Another revert + fix  tomorrow
 Astrobytes: Still, that's 1 less
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: Was wondering why I had such a discrepancy between my CG IDE version and my offline runner version
 MSmits: oh they didnt have the same bug?
 Astrobytes: Nope, I've been working on the CG IDE version using results from the other
 Astrobytes: Therein lies the issue
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: I would say it's bad practice, but I do a lot worse
 Astrobytes: It's terrible practice, and my offline runner is just two instances of the same agent fed with different parameter coeffs, hacky
 Astrobytes: Although it's quite flexible, I should rewrite it a bit to make it a little more generic
 MSmits: my offline runner for meta mcts is usually just 1 instance of a bot playing itself using 1 reused tree :P
 MSmits: also it decides by itself which of the two selves won :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah I'm not running an MCTS type thing yet, that's a headache for another day
 Astrobytes: *meta-mcts
 MSmits: it's a headahce the first time
 MSmits: gets a lot easier, i reuse the entire  gui part 
 Astrobytes: like most new things I guess
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: meh, guis
 Astrobytes: I love my console window
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: Though actually I'm probably gonna do some visuals, and use imgui for the gui elements. It's on the list

 jakobus89: full
 Astrobytes: Great. Thank you for the live updates.
 Astrobytes: MSmits - what's with the zoom
 MSmits: oh I can use it to walk through the tree
 MSmits: I *play* a move
 MSmits: see the new board and node values
 MSmits: when i click "up" i go back up the tree
 Astrobytes: So it's totally not what one would assume of a 'Zoom' button :D
 MSmits: nope
 Astrobytes: You never did HCI right
 MSmits: i dont know why I called it that at first, but it stuck
 MSmits: nope and I have to teach it
 MSmits: in 2 months
 MSmits: one of the first topics
 Astrobytes: lol, just don't show 'em that :D
 MSmits: hehe i wont
 MSmits: i did some things right though, buttons with 1 word on it are good
 MSmits: it's just the wrong word
 Astrobytes: wdym, "Press this button for the result" is a great button caption
 Astrobytes: :P
 jakobus89: How can i hide the chat window??
 Astrobytes: Go under your desk
 jakobus89: In a game?
 Astrobytes: See the arrow just below this chat? That one
 jakobus89: Thank your very much, now i can win the clash!
 MSmits: you can also disable it with /?disableChat at the end of your url I think
 Astrobytes: It should minimise the chat for you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah not in a clash tho MSmits, it'll reload the window 
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Right, now I have a list of bugs to fix.I call that a successful evening.
 MSmits: yes, lists are good
 MSmits: bugs.append(bug)
 Astrobytes: Haha, yes indeed.Anyways, I'm out now. I'll catch you later MSmits, take care and gn
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: gn8

 JayM9: hi
 JayM9: can someone help
 JayM9: I dont know how
 Tuo:&#160;?
 JayM9: to do this, it says that this man has a square grid with size N * n and I need to find how many 4 square plots are in there
 JayM9: But, the problem I am having is that if it is a 5*5 square, then there will be units in between the groups of squares 
 JayM9: swhich cannot be used to account for a square total
 Tuo: you proply have to place the squares in the grid
 Tuo: not just calculate how many there is
 Tuo: or maybe a better formula then just n*n/16&#160;:)
 Tuo: * 4
 Thollang: hi
 Imsure1200q: hi
 MSmits: hi
 Imsure1200q: definitely did not give up in space maze
 Imsure1200q: 100% 
 MSmits: you solved it? Or did you 100% not give up yet
 Imsure1200q: i 100 100% did not give up
 MSmits: yet
 Imsure1200q: yet
 MSmits: got it
 Imsure1200q: but i was desperate also
 Imsure1200q:&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's a pretty cool puzzle from what I hear, quite challenging
 MSmits: one of the hardest we have I think
 Imsure1200q: was thinking of like minecraft
 Imsure1200q: you can make a similar thing in minecraft
 Imsure1200q: and then solve it there
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: seems a roundabout way but sure
 Astrobytes: what happened to your ray-casting NN solution
 Imsure1200q: faile
 Imsure1200q: too much memory
 Imsure1200q: consup
 Astrobytes: I see...
 MSmits: raycasting NN?
 Imsure1200q: also i actually tried training the nn but c++ wouldnt cooperate so l
 MSmits: sounds like something for marslander 3
 Imsure1200q: yeah
 Astrobytes: This goes back a while MSmits
 MSmits: no doubt
 Imsure1200q: mid 2020
 Imsure1200q: imma fai this challenge
 Imsure1200q: just because idk what compound interest is
 MSmits: but you will do so spectacularly
 Imsure1200q: should i just leave this challengee
 Imsure1200q: like idk what compund interesti t
 MSmits: I dont know what that is either
 MSmits: but you can always do easier puzzles first, while you are tortured by the memory of failure
 Imsure1200q: yes
 Imsure1200q: a
 Imsure1200q: finally
 Imsure1200q: first place
 Imsure1200q: i am very proud of myself and an
 Imsure1200q: m definitely not a give upper
 Imsure1200q: how many peepl solv space maze tho, stilll 5?
 MSmits: i think you can tell from the puzzle main page cant you?
 Imsure1200q: hold on leme check
 Imsure1200q: was doing like a challenge earlier
 derjack: MSmits in othello do you have exact stable discs number algorithm?
 MSmits: I think so yes
 derjack: using bitboard tricks eh
 MSmits: lemme find it, sec
 MSmits: it's not my algo
 MSmits: I found it
 derjack: from edax?
 MSmits: I think so, if thats the giant bot thats public
 derjack: alright
 derjack: and you use it in your bot?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: doesnt help all that much if i remember correctly
 MSmits: but I like that it probably solves faster
 derjack: then probably it wont help meh, n-tuples would take care of that mostly
 MSmits: probably
 MSmits: yeha i do this with the information:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aa2070b1-84f1-46fc-b5ca-4971e96ad0a4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aa2070b1-84f1-46fc-b5ca-4971e96ad0a4</a>
 MSmits: so with 33 stable disks you win
 MSmits: and i also put it through eval with a param
 MSmits: evalScore += (stableCount0 - stableCount1) * STABLE_WEIGHT;
 Alexhasapython: hi
 karliso: What is n-tuples?
 derjack: patterns
 karliso: How are hese n-tuples used in games?
 derjack: some patterns are better than others i.e. 2x2 corner showing that is owned by your discs is very beneficial
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.5111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.5111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
 MSmits: karliso, it is a lot like training a NN
 MSmits: except you determine the structure 
 MSmits: instead of lettign the NN discover it
 karliso: cool.
 karliso: Suppose I have eval with weights, like W1 * ount1 + W2 * count2 .. Would training for weights be like n-tuples?
 derjack: yes
 MSmits: yeah, just a lot more of them
 derjack: i use n-tuples and eval weights for othello
 MSmits: i can do the whole ntuples thing pretty easily I think. I just havent found a good way to fit them
 MSmits: well i know what i have to learn
 MSmits: TD or something
 MSmits: havent spent enough time learning about it thoug
 derjack: its all about training pipeline. im using more a0 style training than TD
 MSmits: whats a0?
 derjack: it works for any game as long as you design relevant NN for the game
 derjack: alpha zero
 MSmits: oh
 derjack: but without policy. i train only value
 MSmits: did you use some base to work off?
 MSmits: or did you come up with everything yourself?
 derjack: i havent used any libraries
 MSmits: yeah i would prefer the value thing also, policy probably helps, but it seems off
 derjack: using the description + my experimentations
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I should definitely learn that before I ever get into real NN
 MSmits: seems very useful for fitting params, even if you have only like 8
 Imsure1200q: i solve circling in space maze but idk how to even translate that into algo
 derjack: 
 Imsure1200q: if theres 7 billion people
 Imsure1200q: 5% = 350 million
 Imsure1200q: but theres only 8 people solv
 Imsure1200q: 8 / 5% = 160
 Imsure1200q: so only 160 people even tried
 Imsure1200q: well max is like 175
 Imsure1200q: dude i wonder how people achieve O(n) in things that seem impossible like wow
 Imsure1200q: im so dumb o
 Imsure1200q: i think i use recursive waay too much
 Imsure1200q: no wonder it takes so long
 Imsure1200q: oh
 Imsure1200q: thats good i found heuristic
 Imsure1200q: but it will probably take a dumb amount of memory and time ill fail anyway
 Imsure1200q: and i found 2 solution to circling yaay&#160;:/
 Sooran: hello~
 Imsure1200q: i
 fkaiky: oi
 fkaiky: algum br
 Imsure1200q: really hope i have the right heuristic
 Imsure1200q: or else
 Imsure1200q: astrobytes will laugh
 Astrobytes: My sides are splitting.
 Imsure1200q: like youre becoming 1 /2 
 Astrobytes: "split one's sides" - be convulsed with laughter
 Astrobytes: How long do we have the privilege of your presence this time? 1 or 2 weeks?
 Imsure1200q: studies show that if you laugh ~at me~ you will die
 Blai8: good to know chief
 Imsure1200q: oh for the privilege idk
 Imsure1200q: like
 Imsure1200q: apparently its my fault that my aunts internet is draining
 Imsure1200q: idk though ill just get this heuristic into the code and them boom ill leave disappear into the air
 Imsure1200q: although im kinda liking how its going effectively and looking back at how dumb i was for not even thinking of it i might try to solve it now so you cant laugh at me and die
 Imsure1200q: :sparkles:
 Wontonimo: i was worried of my mortality, but with you reassurance my fears have faded 
 Imsure1200q: yes
 Imsure1200q: because so far
 Imsure1200q: it works in 1-7
 Imsure1200q: but idk about like 8 - infinity
 Imsure1200q: breaking nnews level 8 is giving me nightares you guys might die alswell
 Imsure1200q: im sorry
 Wontonimo: my soul is prepared to be released from this mortal plane if failure becomes an eventuality
 Wontonimo: or something
 Imsure1200q: oh good i figured something out
 Imsure1200q: :clap:
 Wontonimo: nah, laughter seems like a better option now that i think it over
 Imsure1200q: i just gifured it out
 Imsure1200q: figure
 Imsure1200q: d
 Wontonimo: oh, what?
 Imsure1200q: 2 l8
 Imsure1200q: cant die now
 Wontonimo: it would have solved so many problems though
 Imsure1200q: wy level 8 can solve problems?
 Astrobytes: Darn. I was just getting ready to shuffle off this mortal coil...
 Imsure1200q: thats good
 Imsure1200q: ok onto lefel 9
 Imsure1200q: ok
 Wontonimo: what's the algo (at a high level, no spoilers) that you are using?
 Imsure1200q: like basically each moving tile has like
 Imsure1200q: a direction (duh)
 Wontonimo: fascinating ;P 
 Imsure1200q: and you take note of the 
 Imsure1200q: look ok idk how to explain it
 Imsure1200q: like instead of all that raycasting nonsense just like
 Imsure1200q: use regexp
 Imsure1200q: to find how much a tile can move
 Imsure1200q: and then you have to do all that A* stuff or something you take the "bounds" of a tile and see if it can intersect with another tile to be blocked or it can be blocked by another block 
 Wontonimo: so many times words poorly explain code and the best is just to explain with code (but don't do that plz)
 Imsure1200q: i didnt even code it yett
 Astrobytes: So you know A* now then.
 Imsure1200q: cuz i dont wanna see like 100 errors while im tryna get an idea of how my heuristic should be
 Passifi: So in the prefix code puzzle I pass all testcases and all validators  except for the 4th one. any suggestions how I can Debug this&#160;? The validators don't really give me feedback so I am a little lost ^^ 
 Wontonimo: validators are not supposed to give you feedback, they are there just to make sure you didn't hardcode the solution 
 Wontonimo: link&#160;?
 Astrobytes: And they should be similar to the testcases - but usually testing some edge case
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/prefix-code">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/prefix-code</a>
 Passifi: yeah I get that but how can I improved my solution if I don't know whats wrong ^^
 Wontonimo: welcome to programming
 Passifi: On paper and in my mind everthing always works till I test it&#160;;)
 Imsure1200q: that is how i am doing my heruistic guys
 Wontonimo: Passifi - which test case are you failing?
 Passifi: Well none .. I only fail one validator
 Wontonimo: which validator are you failing ...
 Astrobytes: 4
 Passifi: the fourth
 Imsure1200q: try like making custom test cases run that boom does it fail or no 
 Wontonimo: so the 4th on should be very similar to the 4th unit test.  Usually  that's how the creators do this (but not always).  Passifi do you have an idea of how you could generate your own tests?
 Wontonimo: (and what lang are you coding in?)
 Astrobytes: Look at the name of the 4th test
 Passifi: c++ I'll have to think about making my own tests its a topic I have been avoiding so far ^^ but maybe a good excercise
 Astrobytes: I can confirm that the validator is extremely similar to the testcase, with the same result
 Passifi: hmm okay then I'll play around with that a little bit&#160;:) thanks for the input guys&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: np, good luck!
 Wontonimo: so, very often for theses sorts of things, i'll first write the code that creates the test (as per the write up, abracadabra becomes 10010001... ) 
 Wontonimo: Passifi one more thing, if you have your decoder, and you write an encoder, you can in c++ write "assert( decoder(encoder(example)) == example)
 Wontonimo: for as many test cases as you like
 Passifi: okay thanks wontonimo now back to the drawing board :sunglasses:
 Wontonimo: every time i submit my bot it seems to rank lower ); 
 Imsure1200q: see your dying]
 Wontonimo: with every heartbeat 
 Wontonimo: quick fact&#160;: you can hold your breath for the rest of your life
 Imsure1200q: until you die
 Imsure1200q: when its the end of your life you cant hold your breath anymore
 Imsure1200q: your drowning in quicksand
 Imsure1200q: because level 11 is torturing me
 Imsure1200q: im like a voodoo doll you know 
 Astrobytes: Inanimate and full of pins?
 Imsure1200q: yes
 Imsure1200q: my biceps are cramping from too much facepalmming
 Imsure1200q: well at least the movements arent so memory hogging 
 Imsure1200q: and ifever there is only one solution during a timeframe i can just delete the rest of the heuristics and go with that on as the origin
 Wontonimo: yeah, do that!  my life depends on it
 Wontonimo: uttt is making me superstitious with its randomness or scoring 
 Imsure1200q: yess
 Imsure1200q: figured it ot
 Imsure1200q: finalt
 Imsure1200q: ok o 12
 Imsure1200q: 13
 Imsure1200q: im getting bored now
 Imsure1200q: i like
 Imsure1200q: using blockstates
 Imsure1200q: nice 14
 Wontonimo: so, are you making a generic solver or are you kinda coding for each level?
 Imsure1200q: geenrtic
 Wontonimo: +9000
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup_tone1:
 Imsure1200q: coding for each level wont bypass validator
 Imsure1200q: so sleepy tho

 TheDayIsMyEnemy: are you?
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok..
 darkhorse64: :hammer:&#160;?
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: Are you BlaiseEbuth?
 Wontonimo: i think Imsure1200q fell asleep on us ... I need updates on my life expectancy!
 jacek: short
 Passifi: Hehem for those who helped me short update I had part of my code had cout &lt;&lt; "error" instead of cerr &lt;&lt; "error" and thats what broke it... I feel quite stupid now ^^ 
 jacek: oO
 darkhorse64: errors are seldom smart
 Wontonimo: sometimes i solve the mysteries of the universe in 30 seconds, sometimes it takes me 5 hours to see that the reason a line of code isn't working is because i have commented it out
 Wontonimo: I've been there all too often Passifi
 jacek: or when you timeout because you forgot pragma
 darkhorse64: or because you add pragma after includes
 Wontonimo: ^^ WHAT?  oh man...
 Wontonimo: (admits noobness and checks code)
 darkhorse64: It took me a while for this one
 Wontonimo: looks like i was a lucky c++ noob and just did it correctly by accident
 jacek: meh. imagine if not
 jacek: youd get 3x speedup by now
 Wontonimo: that would be nice
 Scarfield: "did it correctly by accident" xD
 Scarfield: nice one
 jacek: software development in practice
 jacek: hows the game, chessfield
 Scarfield: starting to get there, messing around with eval a bit more, then go for minmax. still havent implemented promote, castling, 3fold or 50move draw though
 Scarfield: just testing the eval on legal moves, no depth
 Scarfield: oh and no enpassant yet either
 jacek: i still needs castling and en passant
 Scarfield: yea castling is annoying :p bitboarding i assume?
 jacek: yes. though not very smart
 jacek: many things i do on bitboards i'd do in array
 Scarfield: what depth do you get? 
 struct: you need to prune a lot
 struct: Ordering moves is also important
 jacek: 3 plies
 jacek: ordering from TT and killer moves
 Scarfield: really i would have thought you would get more, iterative deepening?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: as i said, my bitboard is dumb
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: right now im training nn with jacekmax. nothing serious as i still need to make castling, but its already better than my material eval
 Scarfield: nice :muscle:
 Scarfield: next week i will delve into the depths of minmax'ing, but already 2k lines to handle the game .O
 jacek: per game, most of the time it takes to see if king in check
 jacek: and i do it from scratch every time
 Scarfield: makes sense, you have to check that for every move, unless you somehow know moving a piece wont affect the king
 jacek: thats what im planning
 struct: how do you check to see if king is in check jacek?
 jacek: or buck it, lets copy paste stockfish
 Scarfield: rip discovery checks :p
 jacek: struct queen, knights moves from king and pawn attacks
 Scarfield: same ^
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/U4ogK0MIzqk?t=475">https://youtu.be/U4ogK0MIzqk?t=475</a>
 struct: Not sure if keeping track of attacked cells is better or not, I havent coded a chess engine yet
 Scarfield: hmm interesting, i have even seen this video before, just forgot about it
 Scarfield: seems to be worth it, at least in early and midgame with many pieces reamaining on the board. I just realised i still see if a king is in check from pieces no longer on the board, but well optimization must wait some mor

 iigna: wow
 MSmits: good intellisense
 MSmits: no spelling errors for you
 HunterEhrenfeld: proper capitalization as well
 iigna: EXCEL is the best
 AntiSquid: it's better with python
 HunterEhrenfeld: im going to be #1 in Clash of Code
 AntiSquid: there can be no greater goal in life
 HunterEhrenfeld: I just got second place by 1 second. I dont think i can meet my life goals
 deoignition: imagine coding in python
 HunterEhrenfeld: quick and simple
 deoignition: dynamic typing is ass
 AntiSquid: :thinking: can't imagine the world without python
 HunterEhrenfeld: i mean, i agree
 MSmits: without python there would just be more brackets
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: curly ones
 AntiSquid: deoignition do you use java by any chance?
 deoignition: AntiSquid no java is ass
 HunterEhrenfeld: java is lit
 deoignition: c# &gt; c++ &gt; python &gt; java
 HunterEhrenfeld: where did java hurt you
 deoignition: its just a worse c#
 deoignition: i do have to learn it for my gr 12 cs course next year tho lol
 HunterEhrenfeld: lol welp
 AntiSquid: was asking because there's usually a pattern people follow:hate python, hate JS, hate anything that's good in life, but like Java
 deoignition: i mean it makes sense, dynamic vs static typing is very polarizing 
 HunterEhrenfeld: dynamic typing seems fake. but it does make for quick coding lol
 AntiSquid: java is below the nadir, python is the zenith 
 AntiSquid: to follow up on polarization

 ErnestEnriquez: Just not the second
 jacek: you have hints on the left
 Wontonimo: jokers on the right
 Wontonimo: sooo ...
 Wontonimo: because i have a one track mind ... ima gonna ask about mcts solver ...
 Wontonimo: anyone have any thoughts about mcts solver finding a loss, and then just seems to give up?
 jacek: huh
 Wontonimo: i mean, when my solver finds a win, it's 100% ... fantastic.  when it finds a loss, it just turtles
 jacek: at root level?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: oh, haha
 Wontonimo: cuz it lost
 jacek: if all moves are lost, then its lost
 Wontonimo: :rofl:
 jacek: unless you have so typo in back propagation
 jacek: does it play better?
 Wontonimo: i was thinking there was some mistake the opponent could do to lose
 Wontonimo: no, it doesn't play better.
 jacek: choose the lose with most visits
 jacek: bigger chance opponent misses his win
 Wontonimo: all benefit seems to be eaten
 Wontonimo: yeah, i do choose the loss with most visits, but just by accident.  i'll review that section of code now that you mention it, thanks

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo have you tried weighting scores by depth?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh you are legend in UTTT, so I'm not telling you anything you don't know
 jacek: mhm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 6th in uttt, did u do it with mcts?
 jacek: i got into top20 with mcts, now its mcts+nn
 Stilgart: jacek: i was wondering... how do you generate the data for training your nn&#160;?
 MSmits: self play I assume
 jacek: 1 method is (chess nnue style): if you already have some bot: generate semi-random self-play games, generate millions positions and label them by the bot + N depth search
 jacek: 2 method: each iteration mcts self-play games, record the positions and labels of the root value, then train the NN, then repeat the iteration with the better NN
 Stilgart: thanks
 kovi: ?3 play through cgbench vs. top
 Stilgart: now i can look into this nnue style (2nd method is too hazy for me right now)
 Stilgart: kovi: is this really the right way to learn&#160;?
 jacek: nope :v
 jacek: well the idea of first method is to adjust your eval (0 depth) to better eval (n depth), so your eval is smarter
 Stilgart: i would assume that this will lead to overfitting and poor performance against the second half of legend
 kovi: it did worked on rebless once<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stakernotes.com/diamond-ranked-ml-for-halite3/">https://stakernotes.com/diamond-ranked-ml-for-halite3/</a>
 Stilgart: it mght work in arena for some time, sure
 Wontonimo: if you can get you NN to predict 1 ply worth of score, then you need 2x to 9x less rollouts.  If your NN is as strong as 2 ply, then you need (x2 to 9x)^2 less rollouts.
 MSmits: except you may get 30 times less rollouts from how heavy it is
 Wontonimo: the question is, can you code an NN that costs less rollouts than it is strong.
 Wontonimo: yeah, that
 MSmits: I think the benefit of NN is most obvious for games where it is hard to even get started with an evaluation
 jacek: so far my NN can
 MSmits: where the gamestate is quite complex
 Wontonimo: some papers say, use the grandfather heuristic and only apply the nn (or other factor) ever 3rd ply to save compute
 jacek: but the way i use inputs for the nn, each move needs only to partially update the nn, so its quite fast
 Wontonimo:&#160;!! cool ^^
 MSmits: you mean like incremental eval in a minimax?
 MSmits: I used this in my yavalath minimax, when i make a move i only update the part of the eval that deals with that hex
 jacek: yeah. this is main idea of nnue. in uttt i use 81 squares as input. at most only few of them are changed
 MSmits: ah right
 jacek: i have 77760 weights for uttt. each weight takes utf16 char, so almost no little room for more
 MSmits: are you sure you need that many?
 jacek: i experiment with different net architecture, so far this one is best
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: i have overparametrized inputs, yeah. but it works
 MSmits: what are overparametrized inputs?
 MSmits: also damn you for making me type overparametrized
 MSmits: again!
 jacek: its rather vague term. i.e. in uttt each square can have 30 different types, and there are 81 of them. i use one-hot inputs, so there are always 81 ones, out of possible 2430
 MSmits: 30 types?
 jacek: if i used convnet or something, probably i could get away with less weights, but im too dumb for them yet
 MSmits: empty, cross, circle, times 9&#160;?
 MSmits: that's 27?
 jacek: square, as tiny square
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: why 30 though
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: so you put in some domain knowledge there
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: i treat O differently depending whose side to move now, and/or it is from active board
 MSmits: good. i think it would make NN's on CG a lot better to have domain knowledge in there. It's all well and nice to try and do an azero and learn from nothing, but you work with limitations
 jacek: the training pipeline would take care of the rest
 jacek: i put some domain knowledge in bt as well. its not only empty, white black. but also if the square is attacked by one side, by other side etc.
 MSmits: ah right
 jacek: so protected pawn is different than alone pawn. also technically i have different set of inputs for side to move
 jacek: it doubles the weights, but it is much better than just using another input for current player
 MSmits: right
 jacek: its like thinking of good eval. but you need to think how to make it nn-friendly
 MSmits: well the hard part of getting a good eval is not really thinking of the features, it's finding the parameter values
 MSmits: it's the other way around for a nn
 MSmits: at least that's my experience
 MSmits: though in BT it is different, i could not get the right features there
 jacek: nowadays we have many ways to optimize them
 MSmits: well not me, but sure, science does
 jacek: you are not science?
 MSmits: not this part of science&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe some day
 tibithegreat: jacek why not add some other one-hot inputs with the active board and current player
 tibithegreat: I think I revived some old discussion, I just entered and saw the discussion and I was curios
 jacek: its faster and better to have entirely different inputs based on current player than adding this input. at least in my case. if you do the latter, it would require much more hidden units/layers to see that different current player changes things
 jacek: and the way i doubled the input weights, it costs almost nothing, maybe except some cache penalty. but this way i can get away with fewer hidden units so the computation is less expensive
 JayM9: hi guys
 tibithegreat: hmm interesting, now that you mention it would indeed make it easier for the NN to make sense of the input
 jacek: my approach deals with blitzkrieg naturally
 jacek: no, not blitzkrieg. that other german word...
 jacek: zugzwang!
 jacek: my inputs are prepared so they would be easier for the NN to figure out stuff. i maybe losing generality here, but i dont care
 tibithegreat: fair enough
 Haichen: 0k
 DragonMaster86: hi
 DragonMaster86: :sweat:
 jacek: good evening
 iso9999: good evening
 jacek: AutomatonNN who is Automaton2000
 AutomatonNN: why do you think it was a real one
 Automaton2000: you know, the more you know
 SvilenHristov: hey guys, anyone up for little help with on of the coding games
 jacek: hm?
 AntiSquid: SvilenHristov you can pretty much rephrase that to "can i ask a question"
 SvilenHristov: Can you use Math.min to get the closest distance&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i can
 SvilenHristov: this is the code game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/defibrillators">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/defibrillators</a>
 SvilenHristov: and my code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/YYxLWRJz">https://pastebin.com/YYxLWRJz</a>
 SvilenHristov: I think that I calculated all the distances correctly and put them into array, and after that with Math.min I'm finding the lowest value in the array 
 SvilenHristov: but the answer is wrong and I stuck at it for too long...&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: use debug to check at what point you make the mistake
 SvilenHristov: 279379.5538197978, 278940.46901834826, 279560.0406074397
 SvilenHristov: from my side i think 278940 is lower than 279379 but actually is not 
 SvilenHristov: so I'm not sure how to compare those 3 values
 AntiSquid: you're missing some semicolons at the top
 SvilenHristov: this is javascript the semicolons are not required
 AntiSquid: it's late, can't think clearly, but all i can think of are your missing semicolons
 AntiSquid: why is everything a const? this is so triggering
 SvilenHristov: const is used for something that will not change constantly
 AntiSquid: i think it's your data length -1 -2 
 AntiSquid: yup it is

 AntiSquid: here 
 AntiSquid: fixed all mistakes
 AntiSquid: and you're welcome
 pgroke: Hi,is there a way to opt-out of "shortest code" contests? I'm using C++ and that's not really suitable for writing super-short code...
 therealbeef: nope. but it's a good moment to learn another language like python
 pgroke: no, it's not&#160;:)
 therealbeef: why not?
 AntiSquid: those aren't contests, just quick puzzles
 AntiSquid: and python is always good to know
 pgroke: because IMO python is a terrible language. as is JS.
 AntiSquid: check where python is used, how, how much and mostly who uses python
 pgroke: I could do that, but what would it tell me?
 AntiSquid: that your opinion is wrong to put it politely
 therealbeef: python and C/C++ interface quite well. so if you're using C++ for work there is a decent chance you'll need to write some python at some point
 pgroke: I've been programming in C, C++ and C# for over 20 years now and I have never used python. And I don't see where I should have.
 pgroke: Re. where it's used/by whom/for what: that's an argument by popularity/authority, both of which are fallacies.
 AntiSquid: 20 years of coding and you call clash of code a contest 
 AntiSquid: python is good as a "glue" at least
 AntiSquid: easy fast scripting, pipeline your stuff ... 
 pgroke: That may be true. Re. the word "contest" - doesn't the website itself call each puzzle a contest?
 AntiSquid: no
 pgroke: Ah, my mistake.
 SkyViper208: Hey, can someone tell me why "&amp;&amp;" isn't working in my if statement? Am I missing something? (Java)
 pgroke: I've read the word contest on the website in another context and ... misplaced it in my mind&#160;:)
 pgroke: @SkyViper208 - I'm new to this website, if you can tell be where/how to see your code I could have a look.
 Imsure1200q: no way
 Imsure1200q: clash of code aint putting me in first place
 SkyViper208: @pgroke I'm new too lol, i
 AntiSquid: hey, i don't know what your job involves, but i find it hard to believe you wouldn't benefit from using python
 SkyViper208: @pgroke
 SkyViper208: @pgroke if(nextCheckpointDist &gt; 10000 &amp;&amp; boost = 0){
 pgroke: single = is an assignment
 pgroke: not a test
 SkyViper208: ohhh okay thanks
 SkyViper208: two =?
 pgroke: yup
 SkyViper208: Thanks! it worked!
 pgroke: @AntiSquid in my previous job I was developing simple games and after that a Windows embedded video jukebox. In my current job I'm working on the core libraries for an application performance monitoring product that's written in C++.
 pgroke: We use some of the "suitable for glue" languages in our build and automates tests, but those are managed by other teams.
 pgroke: Er. Meant to say: Windows embedded _based_ video jukebox.
 pgroke: (And, well, not the whole APM product is written in C++. But the "agent" is, which is the part I'm working on.)
 AntiSquid: cool stuff
 pgroke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dynatrace.com/">https://www.dynatrace.com/</a>
 AntiSquid: so what do they use for those charts /geocharts? 
 pgroke: Also I should have probably said it's a "software intelligence solution", because it does much more than APM. But people tend to not know what "software intelligence solution" means - whereas many at least have a vague idea when I describe it as application performance monitoring. Which after all is a bit  part.
 pgroke: Frankly I have no idea what the UI side does/uses&#160;:)
 pgroke: That's so far away from the code I'm writing. It's a big product.
 AntiSquid: was just curious, not implying it has to be python, but it's definitely easier in python than c++
 pgroke: what is?
 AntiSquid: charting
 pgroke: Ah.
 pgroke: Well, the server side is in Java and the UI stuff obviously partly in TypeScript (client side).
 pgroke: The part I'm working on is the agent. The agent runs on servers of our clients and monitors their applications. You want performance there and you can't use anything that uses a runtime which you cannot tightly control. And performance not only means running fast but also starting up fast.
 pgroke: So basically anything that doesn't compile to native code is automatically out.
 AntiSquid: D3 i am guessing then (geochart vis)
 pgroke: Possible, as I said, no idea.
 AntiSquid: well you monior the software, gather the data and store it, no?
 pgroke: More of less. But only parts of that are done in the agent obviously.
 AntiSquid: all that analysis is usually done in something "easier to approach" for common folk
 pgroke: At some point the agent sends the data to a cluster which analyzes it etc.
 pgroke: Sure.
 AntiSquid: ya see this is where python shines, since there are a lot of tools readily available for this kind of work, but maybe your company uses something else ...
 pgroke: I know. In that regard, Python is like Playmobil. There's a lot of fancy stuff readily available, but if there's no library that does what you want, and you can't build it by combining some libraries then you're pretty much f-ed because you can't write the actual data processing in Python. I mean of course you can, but then the performance will be so bad that it's unusable.
 pgroke: And I'm more of a Lego Technics kind of guy&#160;:)
 pgroke: But that's not my main problem with Python. My main problem is that it doesn't have static typing and it allows you to modify the structure of existing objects. (BTW: is that still possible using the "new" class model?)
 Migecha: I kept on pressing ctrl + s&#160;:(
 therealbeef: weakly typed languages like python or ruby are ok if you got your unit tests in order, but as a C++ programmer it still creeps me out&#160;;-)
 AndreMarasca: 11 days until SPRING CHALLENGE 2021&#160;:)
 therealbeef: wait what?
 therealbeef: isn't it in May?
 pgroke: try refactoring stuff in a weakly typed language. it's a nightmare - with or without unit tests.
 MadKnight: what? the spring challenge is already so close? 
 MadKnight: but i'm not ready
 Lobster_Speed: spring chall ge
 Lobster_Speed: what is that 
 Lobster_Speed: I only do clash of code on this site 
 therealbeef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 MadKnight: lol
 MadKnight: ooooh dammit 11 days is the length
 MadKnight: AndreMarasca cmon
 therealbeef: :sweat_smile:
 MadKnight: therealbeef were u trolling or u also thought 11&#160;?
 therealbeef: also thought 11
 MadKnight: but it usually shows the time left until the event in a big fancy timer
 Kitkat260: hi
 therealbeef: yeah
 Kitkat260: hru
 MadKnight: wb kitkat
 MadKnight: therealbeef are u getting ready for the contest&#160;?
 therealbeef: sure, previous contest was my first one, but i only joined halfway. want to see how far i can make it&#160;:)
 therealbeef: trying out some algorithms in the meantime
 MadKnight: oh, and on what games&#160;?
 therealbeef: uttt, and now csb
 MadKnight: what algos&#160;?
 therealbeef: minimax, mcts
 therealbeef: and trying some gradient descent on csb
 therealbeef: wish i understood QCQP
 MadKnight: is gradient something like SA&#160;?
 therealbeef: what is SA?
 MadKnight: or what's the general idea&#160;?
 MadKnight: SA is like full random move generation + mutationm
 therealbeef: ah, like genetic algorithm?
 MadKnight: like that, but no crossover
 therealbeef: gradient descent is when you make a score function that is differentiable, and then compute the gradient and make steps upwards toward local optimum
 MadKnight: and mutations are very big in the beginning but they decrease over time
 therealbeef: simmulated annealing?
 MadKnight: oh, SA does that exact thing with random mutations that derease over time
 therealbeef: sounds like annealing
 MadKnight: yea
 MadKnight: so what are u searching with that thing in csb&#160;?
 therealbeef: well, the function for the pos position at time t is linear, so the distance to the next checkpoint is quadratic. then there are constraints that are also quadratic
 therealbeef: *pod
 therealbeef: so it's quadratic constaint quadratic programming
 therealbeef: not easy to solve
 therealbeef: apparently i should rewrite it to something called semi-definite programming and use an interior point solver, but i lost it there&#160;;-)
 MadKnight: wait are u not in gold yet
 MadKnight: what league are u in&#160;?
 TaykYoku: hi
 MadKnight: iih
 therealbeef: gold
 therealbeef: i know many people do neural networks or genetic algo but those should always be beatable by a domain specific algo
 pgroke: test
 therealbeef: ...ok...
 pgroke: the chat stopped updating for me. no idea why.
 MadKnight: therealbeef
 MadKnight: still there&#160;?
 mingmingrr: is there a setting to share code by default?
 Binary_Sky: there is one but i still get option to share
 Binary_Sky: tell me if mines will autmaticly share, i have it on
 mingmingrr: yup, yours auto-shares
 Binary_Sky: yours also shared, unless if you did manually
 mingmingrr: i did it manually, do you know where the setting is?
 pgroke: click your username-&gt;settings-&gt;scroll down

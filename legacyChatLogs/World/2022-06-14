 Tien118:&#160;:)_
 TheOfficialVirus: someone help me i have no clue what this is
 Tien118: what?
 Ayza: what's your problem?
 TheOfficialVirus: i don't know how to code at all
 Tien118: oh
 Ayza: I don't think this is a great website for starting to code
 TheOfficialVirus: i want to learn but it did not guide  me
 TheOfficialVirus: do you know a good site to learn?
 Tien118: hmmmmmm
 Tien118: idk
 Ayza: which language have you decided to learn?
 Ayza: maybe I can guide you to some videos
 TheOfficialVirus: c++ but i don't know what that is
 Ayza: you sure you wanna start with it?
 Ayza: It's a bit discouraging as a beginner
 TheOfficialVirus: i don't know what it is

 derjack: struct is this the great escape? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/624/quoridor">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/624/quoridor</a>
 derjack: Manchi_o6o7 you cant unless he follows you or says something here
 derjack: Tanvir // angle between your pod orientation and the direction of the next checkpoint
 derjack: if i understand correctly, 0 means checkpoint is straight ahead, 30° is slightly left and -30° is slightly right
 Manchi_o6o7: Why is the Travelling Salesman problem NP Hard, when we have the Hungarian algorithm which solves it, and it works in 0(n^4)&#160;?
 derjack: does this algorithm work for any type of graph in TSP?
 Uljahn: does it really solve TSP?
 Manchi_o6o7: I can't find any article on the net where it says that it doesn't finds the optimum path
 derjack: i think the burden of proof is on to prove it finds the optimum path
 b0ot: roughly speaking how many loops before a program timesout
 darkhorse64: derjack; quoridor is almost the great escape with two major differences: two player only, a player jumps above the other player when in contact
 derjack: player jumps? oO
 derjack: oh, he does

 emh: damn. without avx I get 3M iterations, with avx on gcc9 and gcc11 I get 2M iterations and on gcc12 with avx I get 4M iterations. seems like the older versions are bugged
 emh: hope CG will upgrade to gcc 12 then
 emh: ahh well.. I found a workaround, enabling avx2 only for specific functions and got 3.8M

 ethaneCH3CH3: hi, why do I get this error? 
 ethaneCH3CH3: Couldn't find the question related to this contribution
 j4at: Well, im training my NN rn almost done&#160;:) The first time i didn't copy an invisible character!! So had to retrain again because I didn't save the parameters!! I don't know about beating beam search but I Hopefully I beat Wontonimo atleast! 
 Gr0mph: Hi, In C, what is the best method in codingame to get time&#160;?
 TNL: ZXHDB
 struct: top NN is rank 3 j4at
 TNL: yasuo gank team 20gg
 Gr0mph: I have find two that seems work: gettimeofday with sys/time.h and clock_gettime... is it enough good&#160;?
 j4at: ow damn
 j4at: Did they use GA  or RL&#160;? or other&#160;?
 struct: no idea j4at
 struct: Gr0mph I dont use C, in C++ I use high_resolution_clock but I dont think C has it
 struct: I guess you could try one of these
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/measure-execution-time-with-high-precision-in-c-c/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/measure-execution-time-with-high-precision-in-c-c/</a>
 struct: Just make sure to start the timer after you read the first input
 Gr0mph: Hi, Thanks
 Gr0mph: I have check the article and I found the two method that I have already find. So that's the solution.&#160;:)
 j4at: I'm reimplementing the "GAN RL" idea now but with 4 actors and 4 critics. struct <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/LQP5qR1">https://ibb.co/LQP5qR1</a> mine rn doesn't have NN's with "-" So no "GAN RL"
 struct: I will have to look up what GAN RL is
 derjack: for mad pod racing?
 j4at: Search Race
 j4at: Well you need to look up GAN and RL separately. Because I made up GAN RL
 darkhorse64: struct: what kind of eval are you using for SR&#160;?
 struct: nc_id * 50'000 - pos.distance(checkpoints[nc_id] - vel);
 struct: On that replay I used 7 actions but my bot on arena doesnt do that well with it
 struct: the submit one has 5 actions
 darkhorse64: I use nc_id - distance to checkpoint(nc_id)/distance between checkpoints(nc_id, nc_id -1). The vel is an interesting idea
 struct: it was suggested by jacek
 elie.f.asmar: hello, 
 darkhorse64: I'll try it. Thanks
 elie.f.asmar: is this chatroom exclusive for the Search Race minigame, or is it common across all challenges
 struct: its common
 mistcutter713: ji
 mistcutter713: masd'
 elie.f.asmar: When a challenge is tagged to be solved through a genetic algorithm, and the response time per turn is &lt;= 50 ms, how am I supposed to control the algorithm convergence time? Should I keep trying or just try to solve the Search Race puzzle using bare trigonometry 
 struct: you can use whatever algorithm you see fit
 struct: on search race there is a bug for some reason, I'm only able to use 30ms per turn
 struct: You need to start the timer after reading the first input
 struct: Then you must check it to see if you still have time, I check the timer every N  iterations because its expensive.
 j4at: I think you are asking about how to train the NN in 50 secs? elie.f.asmar.Use a simulation and train the NN locally and then copy the parameters to cg
 j4at: ms*
 elie.f.asmar: not a neural network
 elie.f.asmar: a genetic algorithm that needs time to mutate an optimal solution
 elie.f.asmar: The basic genetic algorithm implementation 
 j4at: ow
 j4at: I don't think that's a good idea
 elie.f.asmar: I learned that, the hard way :p
 struct: I think some people do use GA here
 DomiKo: ofc
 struct: I think jacek uses it
 darkhorse64: It works. You run it for 50 ms, pick the best move and reuse your populations
 DomiKo: yes jacek uses it,I uses it too
 elie.f.asmar: Regarding simulations, does that mean I have to code the exact game engine, train my neural network and then generate the model
 struct: with my beam search I get around 30ms 800'000 avg sims per turn
 j4at: Jacek uses GA in Search race&#160;?
 elie.f.asmar: @struct, do you use c++ with multithreading and optimization?
 elie.f.asmar: (pragma)
 struct: There is no multithreading here
 struct: I do use pragmas, but thats about it
 j4at: yep 1 core
 elie.f.asmar: Well I am using JavaScript which is theoretically much slower than c++ in terms of execution time 
 DomiKo: "theoretically" lol
 DomiKo: it won't be a problem to make it work
 DomiKo: you need very little time to have a decent result
 elie.f.asmar: consequently I think that I need to optimize my algorithm 
 struct: Maybe I'll try to use GA, I never used it before
 darkhorse64: I have got the best results with BS but GA is close
 struct: Whats your beam width?
 struct: I use around 10k
 darkhorse64: depth 30, width 8K
 AryanTripathi: sup guys
 j4at: using utf-16 I always get 1 character missing&#160;:(
 derjack: yes, jacek uses GA
 derjack: you can never be sure of 'optimal' move, so you use all the time available
 AryanTripathi: why even use utf 16
 derjack: GA, SA, BS... given the same eval they should be equivalent given different hyperparameters
 j4at: To compress my NN
 darkhorse64: I tried BS because aftezr quantization, I had very few actions left (-&gt; low branching factor)
 derjack: how big is your NN you need to compress it?
 j4at: 80k weights
 j4at: parameters*
 derjack: oh my
 j4at: Go big or go home :p
 derjack: -That.- She.
 DomiKo: 80K is ok. Around 40K chars
 j4at: float16 so 80k chars using only utf-16
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/856cb186-ab28-4e83-a186-b4a962e2e2d0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/856cb186-ab28-4e83-a186-b4a962e2e2d0</a>
 j4at: Anything wrong with my code&#160;? 
 j4at: Okay I found the problem&#160;:)
 DomiKo: was is there?
 DomiKo: was it there*?
 j4at: Yeah
 j4at: Not sure how this works but this fixes the issue
 j4at: parameters = np.round((parameters - min_)/(max_ - min_) * 50000+5295).astype(dtype=np.uint16)
 j4at: my guess is you can't have 0 as first byte
 j4at: or 2 zeros "0" 
 j4at: I will try
 therealbeef: certain byte combinations are illegal in utf-16, iirc
 thethiny: Thanks @AbrahamJLR I saw your response now
 derjack: so youre gonna submit?
 j4at: I will need to train again! :3 Didn't save parameters again
 derjack: quite forgetful
 j4at: Well, i though i will not need to save parameters uncompressed bc I was so confident&#160;:'D
 j4at: perfect solution is this
 j4at: parameters = np.round((parameters - min_)/(max_ - min_) * 55038+256).astype(dtype=np.uint16)
 j4at: for maximum accruacy
 j4at: 55039*
 derjack: why 55039
 derjack: is this because above the utf16 char count as 2?
 j4at: I don't know&#160;:'D If I use +55039 i get an error :3
 j4at: I don't know how utf-16 really works only utf-8. too lazy to check
 derjack: some are illegal and can be intepreted as \n for example
 j4at: well solution for  "\n" is to use three double quotes strings in Python. I think there is only 2 illegal characters.
 j4at: ignore what I said above
 j4at: 55296 is out of range not "illegal". all illegal characters are smaller than 256. other than 2 cases which doesn't include \n

 andyyyyy: How hard is getting used to javascript from python?
 Ayza: well it isn't that hard but it depends on you and the time you've used python for
 Ayza: the hard part for me was getting used with the curly braces and to put brackets in if statements
 Ayza: but didnt take long to get used to
 Ayza: (conditional operators aswell)
 andyyyyy: what I can't get used to is how much smaller the standard library is
 andyyyyy: and how many things are much different
 andyyyyy: like for example .sort() sorts a list of strings based on the first indice value...
 Ayza: that too, I was used to rely on python's standard library
 Ayza: str.isdigit(), str.isalnum(), etc
 Ayza: while in js you have to use regex
 andyyyyy: or relying on collections or itertools libraries&#160;:)
 andyyyyy: defaultdict or Counter is my favourite
 andyyyyy: Do you have any suggestions on how I can learn JS better then
 andyyyyy: im thinking i shouldn't think of JS as "python with extra syntax" but just learn it from the ground up.
 DonLarry: maybe just practice
 andyyyyy: Yes I just wondered how best to learn and practice&#160;:)
 Ayza: what I would do is remake projects I did in python in js
 Ayza: and focus on coding in js more to get used to the syntax
 Ayza: ^^that alone teached me a lot by googling
 andyyyyy: true just kinda unsure of what is best practice in python not so much in JS
 andyyyyy: like i can probably hack it together to work, but will it be good is the question

 thethiny: can anyone give me an example of a test case validator?
 thethiny: I don't understand what that is
 thethiny: okay I thin I got it
 thethiny: if the question is to convert abc to ABC
 thethiny: then test case1 would be abc, ABC but validator would be aaa,AAA
 thethiny: right?
 Ayza: A validator gotta test the same case for it's testcase but stay different
 Ayza: for an example if you need to get the nth prime number: if the testcase is a small number try to make the validator a number that is in the same range or slightly bigger

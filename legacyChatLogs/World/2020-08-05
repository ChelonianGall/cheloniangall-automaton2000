 MaiLoc: hi guys
 AbundantPuddle: Hello MaiLoc
 MaiLoc: what's up man&#160;?
 AbundantPuddle: Not too much. Coding, taking no prisoners. How about you?
 jacek: ohai

 AbundantPuddle: For some reason, I thought your avatar was a slug. It was too easy to just look, so I decided to just use a snail. When I checked, I realized you had the hypnotoad.
 AbundantPuddle: It's possible I just have SLurm on the brain.
 AbundantPuddle:                    Does chat remove leading and trailing white space?                   
 AbundantPuddle: It does not.
 No_Name_26: :vv
 jacek: but it does automatically hide your password. im typing ******* and it will replace it with stars
 AbundantPuddle: Really???
 AbundantPuddle: *********
 Putnam3145: shush
 AbundantPuddle: Oh wow! That's crazy!
 Andriamanitra: hunter2
 Andriamanitra: doesn't seem to work for me
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 Putnam3145: actually lemme try

 SPDene: it won't work if you have the same password as someone else!
 Putnam3145: this is a joke. this is not my real password.
 AbundantPuddle: Hahaha!
 Putnam3145: however your passwords should look like this
 Putnam3145: use a password manager kids
 AbundantPuddle: Wait, how did you know my password Putnam?
 SPDene: but I found a way to fool the system... I make all my passwords all-asterisks :P
 AbundantPuddle: Ah yes! Smart! That way your password is always hidden. 
 Andriamanitra: and even when the passwords leak everyone will think yours is redacted and won't try to get into your account
 AbundantPuddle: ^
 AbundantPuddle: That's like M374-1337
 Ripkite: yerrrrrrr
 Ripkite: who here
 Ripkite: where the people at?
 AbundantPuddle: Mentally? Or physically?
 AbundantPuddle: Or metaphysically?
 Ripkite: just wondering what people up to
 AbundantPuddle: Coding?
 AbundantPuddle: Possibly?
 Ripkite: haha no one just chilling
 AbundantPuddle: We were just talking about codingames new feature where it censors passwords in chat.
 Ripkite: hahaha if someone falls for that they deserve to be hacked
 Ripkite: you guys do clash of code?
 AbundantPuddle: Currently clashing now
 Ripkite: what language you using?
 AbundantPuddle: Python
 Ripkite: python is whack
 AbundantPuddle: I'm not really picky about languages. I've been using this site to learn Python. I generally find that any problem with a language tends to come from the person on the keyboard.
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Hello, in Coders Strike Back(SILVER LEAGUE) why my pod sometimes spin around the checkpoints?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Any help?
 AntiSquid: i am guessing your speed is too high
 AntiSquid: lower the speed a bit so the pod has time to turn
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OK, thanks
 Leopold-Fitz-AI: Python seem like running too slow
 DinuBrat: heeey where can i learn python better ( i'm noob)
 Putnam3145: what do you want to learn it for and what kind of problems are you having
 Putnam3145: there's no one path to "learning python", really
 DinuBrat: oh I have learned only base of python 
 DinuBrat: I have problems with puzzles 
 Putnam3145: well, what sort of problem?
 Putnam3145: having difficulty conceptualizing what the problem is asking for, translating it into code, getting errors upon the attempt, etc.?
 DinuBrat: hmmm, i think , translating it into code is most popular in my case
 Putnam3145: in my experience the best way to deal with that is to know what the "code terms" for a lot of the stuff you're doing is, and if you don't, knowing how to do an internet search to get to them
 Putnam3145: early on you'll want to focus on searching skills
 Putnam3145: I know a lot of "code terms" but I've also been doing this for 7 years
 Allis: That's a lifelong skill, really.
 Putnam3145: yeah
 DinuBrat: Thanks boys 
 Allis: Learning how to learn gives you a superpower.
 Putnam3145: yeah, I learned early on how to quickly google things and, well
 Putnam3145: before a week ago I thought I didn't know Ruby, then I saw a problem in clash of code that I immediately thought "ah, Ruby can do this really easily cause it has built-in regex support", which... I don't remember when I learned that, but clearly I did, and it's been a week and now I know Ruby I guess?
 Putnam3145: that's just sort of how things go once you're good at learning
 Putnam3145: this is also why, like
 Putnam3145: I tend to see new programmers agonizing over what language to learn
 Putnam3145: usually I just say "go with python", or, if they're saying "have I made a mistake learning X", I just say "no, keep learning it"
 Putnam3145: because... it doesn't matter that much, actually, and you'll learn more languages later
 Putnam3145: the first one is BY FAR the hardest, because you're learning PROGRAMMING along with it
 Allis: exit$&gt;&lt;&lt;'ERROR'unless(0..255)===i
 Allis: Ruby is crazy.
 Putnam3145: I had only used it previously to patch an open source Dwarf Fortress AI to be able to recognize modded civilizations, since it had hardcoded the names of the positions
 Putnam3145: this problem, naturally, had basically nothing to do with any of Ruby's strengths
 Allis: Oh, I don't know about that; Ruby has a lot of strengths.
 Allis: Comes from really good stock: Smalltalk, Lisp, and Perl.
 Putnam3145: and in fact the project later moved to C++, primarily for speed concerns (the Ruby itself is just an available scripting language for the underlying bespoke Dwarf Fortress memory hacking library it was written for)
 Allis: That's fair. You tend to see Lua for things like that nowadays.
 Putnam3145: well also a problem is that Ruby, for some reason, doesn't have first-class access to the memory, just working through a more high-level API
 Putnam3145: in this library
 Putnam3145: while Lua, the other scripting language available, does
 Putnam3145: and so does the C++ obviously
 Putnam3145: all very odd
 Putnam3145: I finally got to the end of the clash of code path
 Putnam3145: by getting 3 "shortest" clashes in a row, all of which I won with Ruby one-liners
 Putnam3145: turns out: yeah, it's pretty good
 DinuBrat: ohh yeah I like "shortest" in clash of code but code in ruby is really shorter than pyton
 Allis: Not always, but pretty often.&#160;:)
 Putnam3145: I've had experiences where Python ends up shorter
 Putnam3145: almost always due to set or list comprehensions being the way to go
 Putnam3145: quite often map{} is at least as good though
 Putnam3145: set comprehensions in particular are highly useful
 Putnam3145: though I haven't really, like
 Putnam3145: tried to determine if they have the edge over .unique
 Allis: *#uniq
 Putnam3145: yeah sorry
 Putnam3145: I'm new to this, I don't have the full enumerator library memorized, hehe
 DinuBrat: If you know many pythone clues you  can write code shorter )
 Putnam3145: you have 15 minutes to google stuff, which actually helps a lot
 Allis: Hell, I've been doing Ruby for years and I probably don't. :sweat_smile:
 Putnam3145: often I'll be one of the last half to finish in shortest clashes and still win, just cause I spent a good deal of time trying to find the smallest way to do what I'm doing
 Allis: That's the whole fun of it!
 DinuBrat: oh boys how old are you?
 Allis: Shaving a few characters after you thought for sure you couldn't can be quite a thrill.
 eulerscheZahl: ping Gorbit99
 Allis: Which I know sounds silly.
 Putnam3145: sometimes you see people do it in C# or C++ and have &gt;500 characters and I think they didn't notice it was a shortest, which, to be fair, I've done the opposite
 Putnam3145: thought I was on shortest, spent 7 minutes doing a ruby bit, found out it was actually fastest the whole time
 Putnam3145: oh man one that I recently won I felt bad, cause the Javascript solution was legitimately better than mine
 Gorbit99: ruby is the language of the gods
 Putnam3145: in terms of brevity
 Putnam3145: but the Javascript around it made it longer
 eulerscheZahl: hi Gorbit99 saw your forum post
 Putnam3145: like, the names of the functions and things
 Gorbit99: I was summoned
 Putnam3145: I'm 25 years old, myself
 eulerscheZahl: i missed the same feature. so i coded it on my own
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Allis: May I ask whether I played some part in inspiring you to try Ruby?
 Gorbit99: Ich liebe dich
 Putnam3145: Ruby was my #3 language of choice for CoC on average beforehand, but I started trying to use it exclusively for shortest after
 Gorbit99: but it would be great as a built in
 Putnam3145: I was usually using Python3 for it unless I saw strings
 eulerscheZahl: i agree
 Putnam3145: after, I started using it for ranges too
 Allis: Hmm... Python's pretty good for strings, syntax-wise anyway.
 Gorbit99: also, my post is mainly about that load time
 Astrobytes: You've become very active on CG recently Gorbit99, any particular reason?
 eulerscheZahl: and imne isn't always 100% up to date as new puzzles appear
 Putnam3145: yeah, but Ruby's transcendent
 Allis: Also, 192 methods on String. XD
 Putnam3145: mostly cause of how nice and entrenched regex is into the language
 Gorbit99: not sure if it's just me or whatever, but 0.2 seconds seems weird
 eulerscheZahl: loading time is horrible and makes my browser cry in pain
 Gorbit99: Astrobytes, blame quests and the contribution quest line
 Astrobytes: Aha :D
 eulerscheZahl: but i fear that they add pagination when we complainmakes it harder for my script to index puzzles
 Gorbit99: yeah, please don't do that
 Gorbit99: just store the images on a public server and return the url or something 
 Gorbit99: "we added pagination" would be a weird answer to "searching up previous puzzles are hard"
 Putnam3145: it's amazing how long you can go without learning certain things
 eulerscheZahl: their reaction to "too many players at CSB, takes long to load add fight my friends": only show top1000 of the leaderboard
 Putnam3145: I only learned about red-black trees in the last months or so
 eulerscheZahl: so lower ranked players can't even fight their friends anymore
 Astrobytes: Regarding checking previous puzzles , I suppose the keyword/tag system is supposed to help with that. It doesn't.
 eulerscheZahl: especially for clashes. new users can't even access the list of contributions at all
 Gorbit99: they can add pagination if they add a search feature too
 eulerscheZahl: i'd gladly turn off my own puzzle search then
 eulerscheZahl: i even index comments on the contributions
 Astrobytes: Since they're actively working on things atm we might stand a chance of getting something
 wlesavo: oh, i didnt even knew such feature existed, now my browser is frozen :smiley:
 Astrobytes: hehehe, that's the one alright
 Gorbit99: it will be frozen for the next minute
 Gorbit99: apparently 7.5kb of data can take 160ms to arrive
 wlesavo: yeah, i closed the tab, quite impossible to look for smth
 Gorbit99: once it loads, it's basically perfect
 eulerscheZahl: except for the missing search
 Gorbit99: eulerscheZahl with your tool I immediately found that yes, my idea already existed
 Astrobytes: And the fact the contribution list is hidden from some users
 wlesavo: are you supposed to look by ctrl+F?
 Gorbit99: yup
 Astrobytes: close your eyes, scroll, click
 Gorbit99: I don't fully understand why it's hidden from most users, it doesn't show a solution or anything
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's somewhat counter-intuitive
 eulerscheZahl: you could get a clue for reverse
 Gorbit99: also, I love how the nintendo challenge is the top suggested topic for every other topic, because it has 30k views
 eulerscheZahl: or prepare a solution for all clashes
 Gorbit99: in the time that page loads, someone will probably come up with the solution
 wlesavo: it shows the validators i believe
 wlesavo: for clashes that is
 Gorbit99: let me check while it's loaded
 eulerscheZahl: but the way it is right now it's unfair. some can see the list, others can't
 Astrobytes: Shouldn't be too hard just to show the name and statement instead
 Gorbit99: you're right it does
 eulerscheZahl: used to be different. when they set the limits, lvl29 was on the high end with only a handful of users having access
 Gorbit99: I mean, the example solution gets hidden, can't the validators too?
 wlesavo: i think the logic here is for approvers to be able to check for duplicates
 Gorbit99: correct me if I'm wrong, but you can make contributions way below level 20
 eulerscheZahl: the solution is visible too for some users. lvl29+ for puzzles
 Astrobytes: Yes wlesavo, and authors too. But the way it is, it doesn't work well
 eulerscheZahl: 300 clash participations for CoC i think
 Gorbit99: yep, solution visible for coc thingys
 Gorbit99: anyways, how are you expected to check for duplicate puzzles if you can't see the puzzles in the first place?
 Astrobytes: Precisely
 wlesavo: Astrobytes well i just trying to see at least some reasons, not that i agree with it
 eulerscheZahl: duplicates are explicitly allowed for CoC
 Gorbit99: ok, I'd say, search feature, looks for words in puzzles and statements and only displays those
 wlesavo: oh, euler and astro now are mods, didn't notice, grats
 Astrobytes: wlesavo, absolutely. It should be easy for people to be able to check
 eulerscheZahl: be nice or i'll kick you :P
 Astrobytes: And thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 Gorbit99: yeah, I seem to remember euler not being a mod way back when he won a challenge (and I was around)
 Gorbit99: competition*
 Gorbit99: not challenge
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't even aware that the forum needs attention too
 wlesavo: now i can legetimately call for euler when i need a mod, as i did before :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: i never won a contest&#160;:(
 Gorbit99: you didn't? the ghost in the shellcode one?
 eulerscheZahl: beaten on the last day
 Gorbit99: ah
 Gorbit99: but you had a writeup of it 
 eulerscheZahl: had a terrible bug in my code as i found out later
 Astrobytes: One day the curse will be lifted euler&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: called a function to modify a list of factories i want to upgrade
 eulerscheZahl: created a new list inside the function instead of modifying
 eulerscheZahl: so it didn't backpropagate and my upgrade sucked
 Gorbit99: that sounds a fun bug
 eulerscheZahl: i'm now on a similar level as the contest winner
 Gorbit99: I couldn't properly finish a competition yet
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely had a problem with having too little time in a contest
 eulerscheZahl: just running out of ideas at some point
 Gorbit99: I had too little attention span usually :P
 Astrobytes: I think it's psychological euler, if you push through that you can do it I think
 Gorbit99: this is why I'm 9th in coc and not in any competition
 eulerscheZahl: i have that problem too. chat is distracting
 eulerscheZahl: and i lose interest after a while&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: That and not telling everyone your strat halfway through
 Gorbit99: does the fall competition have any date associated already?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Gorbit99: or just a "no clue"?
 Astrobytes: Nothing as yet
 eulerscheZahl: we have no idea
 eulerscheZahl: i plan on pitching a game idea of my own. let's see how far i can get with it
 Gorbit99: good, then it's probably either during aoc or some fun part of uni
 eulerscheZahl: game is basically finished
 Astrobytes: Hopefully we can at least have an unofficial contest, if not a fully official one
 wlesavo: as a different competition or for a fall contest euler? 
 eulerscheZahl: different to fall contest
 eulerscheZahl: as this will be an official one designed by CG
 Gorbit99: I'm only doing small puzzle contribs so far
 Gorbit99: you know, I need my own puzzles in coc to get an edge
 Astrobytes: :D
 wlesavo: no fog this time? :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: that was the point when i stopped clashing: approved a contribution and played it 2h after
 eulerscheZahl: i'm biased on fog
 Gorbit99: only 2? I had it after 45 mins
 Astrobytes: lol, jeez
 eulerscheZahl: but afk for now. getting hungry
 jacek: get some flies
 Gorbit99: he used to have an animated profile pic as I remember
 Astrobytes: Yeah? Don't remember that. He changes it to suit contest themes usually though
 Gorbit99: might've just seen the gif elsewhere
 Astrobytes: yeah, plenty hypnotoad gifs around
 Gorbit99: Finally found a coc worthy idea that wasn't used before
 Astrobytes: There should probably be an achievement for that
 Gorbit99: for contribution creation?
 Astrobytes: Finding an idea that wasn't used before
 Gorbit99: you would think with only 1000 submissions, there would be plenty
 Gorbit99: also a preview window for contributions would be great, might make a forum post about it
 Gorbit99: right now you need to write the test cases at least to see how it looks
 Astrobytes: In CoC contributions duplicates are allowed, and there is also the 'no clash is too easy' rule...
 Gorbit99: no clash is too easy, but if your solution is 1 line long and is "return n * (n -1)", then it will be downvoted to oblivion
 SPDene: true, but submit "add a and b", "add b and c", "add c and d"..... and see how many get accepted :P
 Gorbit99: all of them usually, because everyone reads the guidelines and knows how to find them, and also that they exists
 Gorbit99: -s
 Astrobytes: It's harder for them to get through the system now, but previously it wasn't
 AggYzz: are there any python cp tutorials out there
 AggYzz: or is it just gradually learning after getting fucked each round
 Gorbit99: cp tutorials?
 jacek: cp tutorials?
 Gorbit99: slow
 Allis: Competitive programming, presumably.
 AggYzz: yes
 AggYzz: not the other cp
 AggYzz: i swear
 SPDene: club penguin?
 Gorbit99: You gradually learn it as you're getting fucked
 Astrobytes: To be competitive in anything it helps if you know something about what you're competing in no?
 Allis: @AggYzz Are you lost?
 AggYzz: what
 AggYzz: yes
 JBM: you are here: ---&gt; *
 Gorbit99: the only thing you need to start competitively is knowing your language well
 Astrobytes: ^
 AggYzz: like knowing all the functions and crap
 Astrobytes: Knowing the crap might not be helpful
 Gorbit99: python for example is considered a great language for it, because it has a big standard lib
 Gorbit99: well, you don't need to *know* all functions
 AggYzz: useful function
 Gorbit99: but you need to know that they exist and how to look them up
 Gorbit99: for shortest for example, literally anything could be helpful
 AggYzz: i think im pretty good wth functions and stuff
 AggYzz: but i suck at thinking
 Astrobytes: Everything else, python has a lib/function for it
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/353/">https://xkcd.com/353/</a>
 AggYzz: either my brain exceeds the mass of the burj khalifa
 AggYzz: or gets smaller than a pea
 SPDene: play some CoC and look at other people's solutions. try to see how they did stuff. if you see something you're not familiar with, research it - things like map, filter, star functions
 Gorbit99: that's where you have to suck it up and practice a lot
 Gorbit99: look at other's solution *if they publish it* -_-
 Uljahn: or solve puzzles and unlock others solutions
 Putnam3145: why do people not publish
 Astrobytes: Also do more puzzles, to get used to features and improving  problem solving
 Gorbit99: standalone puzzles are very different from coc
 Astrobytes: ah Uljahn beat me to it
 AggYzz: ive only done coc
 Gorbit99: Putnam3145 because it's a button press
 AggYzz: not explored codingame out side of that
 SPDene: I sometimes don't publish - if I think what i wrote was a steaming pile of.... even if it finally worked
 Gorbit99: try the practice section, it's fun
 Astrobytes: Yes but they're good for improving general problem solving
 Gorbit99: I always publish, if my code gets 100%
 Gorbit99: if it doesn't then it's crap and I don't
 AggYzz: all 3 people didnt publish in this coc
 AggYzz:&#160;:(
 AggYzz: i really wanted to know
 Astrobytes: Just move on
 Gorbit99: if there were only 3 people in it, chances are 2 of them are bots
 AggYzz: bruh
 Gorbit99: and bots never publish, because they just use some random solution that could be crap
 SPDene: general rule of thumb: if the "location" of a player is a city, it's a bot (you can look at their profile to confirm, but location is faster)
 SPDene: for real players, it shows a country, not a city
 Gorbit99: after a while you'll know them by heart
 Gorbit99: mostly because they are the only players you know played 2 years ago
 Gorbit99: and are still playing
 HieeuSPhamJ: hi
 Gorbit99: hi
 Tiramon: it's quite easy to identify the official clash bots
 Tiramon: just look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a> those with more than 20k clashs are the bots
 Avex: lol
 Gorbit99: til, contribution validators have a 1000 character limit
 Astrobytes: Gorbit99, how about a puzzle with GORBITSA?
 Gorbit99: nice, you've found it
 Astrobytes: I saw it on OLC a while back&#160;:)
 Gorbit99: let's just say, after I've coded the thing in bf, I had my fill of it
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Gorbit99: ah, you're on olc too
 Astrobytes: yup
 Gorbit99: this world is getting smaller by the second
 eulerscheZahl: OLC?
 Astrobytes: I mostly just lurk on olc tbh
 Astrobytes: One Lone Coder

 Gorbit99: link above my message
 Gorbit99: basically pseudo assembly
 dbdr: I'm a poor lonesome coder, (3x)And a long ways from home.
 SPDene: mv dbdr $HOMEthere, fixed :p
 Gorbit99: you moved him to your own home 🤔
 SPDene: he didn't specify WHICH home :P

 eulerscheZahl: which one?
 Astrobytes: BotG
 DomiKo: omg
 eulerscheZahl: took me a while to motivate myself to even resubmit my contest bot in the multiplayer
 eulerscheZahl: as new bosses were added in wood

 eulerscheZahl: oh
 dbdr: my second I think
 eulerscheZahl: right, MM was your first
 dbdr: I'm not *that* much of a noob&#160;;)
 Allis: @Gorbit99 That's incredible.
 eulerscheZahl: so, how did you like your first "real" CG contest made by codingame and not the community? :P
 Astrobytes: Once I got through the wood leagues I was so annoyed and put off by the game I just quit it
 Gorbit99: what's incredible?
 eulerscheZahl: i called it a day after reaching legend
 dbdr: OOC or PAC2020?
 eulerscheZahl: pac
 Allis: Interpreting GORBITSA in brainfuck.
 eulerscheZahl: well, OOC is official too to a big partbut graphics-wise it's not the usual CG quality
 dbdr: I liked pac. but did not see a huge difference with the community ones
 Gorbit99: well, brainfuck is quite easy with the right ide
 eulerscheZahl: CG loves fog&#160;:/
 dbdr: a few community had small issues during the contest, most of them not really
 Gorbit99: and bfdev is the right ide
 Gorbit99: what's fog?
 Astrobytes: *cough*FOW*cough*
 dbdr: but PAC also changed the rules in the middle
 Astrobytes: ah euler dammit
 dbdr: I thought OOC was quite pretty too, IIRC
 eulerscheZahl: CG also changed the rules during c4l and cotc
 Astrobytes: fog-of-war Gorbit99, aka hidden information in this case
 Gorbit99: ahh
 eulerscheZahl: the mines were drawn by illedan :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the submarine was planned to be replaced
 dbdr: you're right, mostly the art was beautiful for OOC

 Putnam3145: there's this weird bit of dopamine i get when i think i come up with a brilliant strategy and then I see that I've overfitted to the boss massively and it actually fails in practice against really basic stuff

 Putnam3145: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ZB8u2it.png">https://i.imgur.com/ZB8u2it.png</a>
 Putnam3145: this is a stalemate, I'm red
 Putnam3145: not actually a stalemate, though
 Putnam3145: I lose cause orange got their one (1) zone 3 ticks earlier
 dbdr: yes, that's the visual effect I meant I think
 Putnam3145: and this is a situation my algorithm cannot account for, which I think is kinda hilarious
 dbdr: didn't CG make art for community contests sometimes?
 eulerscheZahl: for some they hired freelancers
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. BotG
 dbdr: right
 Putnam3145: aaand i just figured out why
 eulerscheZahl: kutulu is free graphics except for the big image used as a contest preview
 Putnam3145: it's because I literally had not considered the idea that a non-owned zone might be tied
 Putnam3145: even though, like, both teams have identical starting positions and all drones are identical
 Putnam3145: i.e. ties are not just possible but *likely*
 dbdr: even paying art cost would probably be very small compared to hiring a freelancer
 dbdr: e.g. nice packs for10$, sth like that
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, if you find something that fits your needs
 AntiSquid: that botg freelancer art work sucked, especially the original one
 Putnam3145: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/03kWrhk.png">https://i.imgur.com/03kWrhk.png</a>
 Putnam3145: there we go
 eulerscheZahl: right, illedan's girlfriend even modified parts of it
 dbdr: or the other way: pick a pack and build a game around it&#160;;)
 Putnam3145: much better situation to be stuck on
 AntiSquid: the racoons had canons coming from their body center it looked like a giant .... it looked wrong
 eulerscheZahl: oh, those are racoons?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: raccoons *  my bad misspelling
 eulerscheZahl: not nagging about your spelling - i don't even know how to spell it
 eulerscheZahl: just saying that i didn't recognize that from the artwork
 AntiSquid: no i just corrected myself
 AntiSquid: we didn't know what to use as general punching bag
 dbdr: I think I didn't even realized those units were animals :D
 AntiSquid: and those graphics could have easier been some free stuff from the web, i even like the original placeholder graphics more
 dbdr: yeah, statement calls them Unit
 Astrobytes: Presumably because they're unidentifiable as raccoons&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: haven't seen those graphics.i can only tell that code a la mode improved a lot short before the contest
 AntiSquid: think it had more to do with how late we received the artwork
 Astrobytes: How late?
 AntiSquid: it was nearing the deadline, couldn't ask for proper changes
 dbdr: to be honest, top view makes it hard to make sprites recognizable
 Astrobytes: That sucks
 dbdr: you mostly see the top of their head :D
 Astrobytes: true dbdr
 JBM: which raccoons?
 eulerscheZahl: minions
 eulerscheZahl: BotG
 dbdr: that summoning
 JBM: oh ok
 JBM: didn't exactly play that one
 JBM: iirc, i think there's two i always mix up
 JBM: double hulk?
 dbdr: right, I think my code calls them minions. liked the name&#160;:)
 dbdr: yes
 JBM: ok, yup, didn't really do that one
 AntiSquid: here a few top down artwork&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/davidkeennc/top-down-characters/">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/davidkeennc/top-down-characters/</a>imo they look a lot better
 dbdr: very big though
 Putnam3145: i literally can't believe this
 AntiSquid: and actually i wanted sideway view ...
 Putnam3145: i made a change to my AI that makes it look *really* stupid
 Putnam3145: but
 Putnam3145: the precise type of stupidity it exhibits seems to confuse other bots
 Putnam3145: so this game, which I was losing before, now ends with a win by me
 Putnam3145: to be exact it vacillates really, really hard
 Putnam3145: turn-to-turn it goes "i'll go here wait no it needs to be here wait no it needs to be here wait no"
 Putnam3145: so it just goes back and forth in and out of a single zone
 Putnam3145: but what this means is that it......
 Putnam3145: actually, that's
 Putnam3145: a super good idea
 dbdr: Putnam3145: the results of a single game tells you very little, unless you have a huge mistake
 Putnam3145: yeah
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by "the bot vacillates"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: is it random&#160;?
 Putnam3145: no, it just changes its target zone every single tick
 Putnam3145: back and forth betwene two
 AntiSquid: ah
 Putnam3145: cause of the way I wrote the priorities system
 Putnam3145: ...to be exact, I didn't differentiate between an enemy zone with 0 contesting drones and one of my own zones with 0 contesting drones
 Putnam3145: that's the source of this bug
 Putnam3145: well that's fixable
 AntiSquid: anyway i think BotG cover artwork is still #1 
 dbdr: botg was fun
 BrokenValentine: 허접ㅋ
 AntiSquid: anyong hasseyo
 AntiSquid: wait are you being mean BrokenValentine&#160;? @_@
 [tom]: hi
 Gorbit99: hi
 _-: hi I have a question. More than one questions actually. What are the workflows you use? Is having a certain kind of tools help? For example type of the keyboard? Or else do they not that matter much?
 Putnam3145: i only think about my keyboard when it's broken
 Gorbit99: they matter only as long as you're used to it
 Putnam3145: so my advice is to use a keyboard that you never notice
 Gorbit99: workflows are per person things
 Putnam3145: really in general that's what I'd say
 Putnam3145: the less you notice your environment while programming, the better
 Putnam3145: allows you to "flow state" better
 Gorbit99: that's why I'm annoyed by vim mode not working on my preset
 _-: I tried to use the extension but that was not that successful
 Gorbit99: the extension is for competitions basically
 _-: Switching back and forth is time consuming
 _-: Yeah right
 Astrobytes: vim mode in the CG IDE doesn't work?
 _-: It works
 Gorbit99: since the new editor, I didn't even consider using an outside editor
 Allis: Not with Vimium enabled for Vim-like everywhere else.
 Gorbit99: Astrobytes what keyboard layout do you have?
 Astrobytes: UK
 Gorbit99: altgr key?
 Astrobytes: yep
 _-: Why would you want to use altgr?
 Astrobytes: to type this: €
 Gorbit99: then my issue is that altgr is probably detected as a normal key
 Gorbit99: in hungarian there are a lot of accented letters, and they got the places of the syntax characters
 Gorbit99: therefore {}[]&lt;&gt;@&amp;;* is all altgr bound
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, I see
 Gorbit99: basically the issue is that I can't do f[ for example
 Gorbit99: because the second I press altgr, the f goes away
 Astrobytes: Have you checked with any other hungarian guys on here to see if they've got the same issue?
 _-: Maybe try a different browser?
 Gorbit99: I'm using chrome
 Gorbit99: if it doesn't work on chrome, there are other issues
 Astrobytes: Shouldn't be a browser issue
 _-: I can type ඳ here it's a altgr bound letter
 Gorbit99: the two possibilites are an editor bug or an arch bug
 Gorbit99: I can't realistically imagine anything else
 Astrobytes: Editor most probably
 _-: Yeah editor most probably
 Gorbit99: if you have an altgr key, you can try it
 _-: Let me try
 Gorbit99: just type in f, and then altgr
 Gorbit99: if it goes away, you have the same bug
 Gorbit99: strangely enough, keycombos with it work
 Gorbit99: but not in commands
 _-: ෂ ජ්බබ
 _-: I can
 Gorbit99: the issue isn't that you can't type altgr characters here
 _-: (in vim insert mode)
 Gorbit99: the issue is that you can't use altgr inside a command in vim
 Gorbit99: so normal mode -&gt; f&lt;altgr&gt; cancels f
 Gorbit99: instead of waiting for the modified key
 _-: me no issue
 Astrobytes: works for me
 Astrobytes: That must be profoundly annoying
 JBM: many things are profoundly annoying in the web editor
 JBM: i couldn't dream of seriously clashing with it anymore
 Astrobytes: That bad?
 JBM: well it wasn't really too good with the formr one
 JBM: autocompetion got in the way more than it used to help
 JBM: nowadays it's the "auto-enclose" behavior of quotes, various parens, that get me angry first
 Allis: You can use a bit of user CSS to disable it.
 _-: I don't like the tooltips
 JBM: yeah, there are always workarounds
 Astrobytes: You can disable auto-close quotes/brackets
 JBM: but having to beat 25 mini-quests before being allowed to have fun playing kills the fun from the start
 JBM: configurability isn't a solution to bad defaults
 FinnWerner: h i 
 Astrobytes: Fair point
 FinnWerner: can somebody help me by mars lander 2?
 FinnWerner: :grin:
 FinnWerner: in java
 DarkLord24: can you guys help me on coders strikes back 
 Astrobytes: You'll get a better response if you state your issues specifically
 JBM: can you guys help me reach 2% in optimization leaderboard?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: HAHA
 _-: too specific _!_
 LeBaoHoang8A4: :thumbsup_tone4:
 Astrobytes: Can someone get me a coffee?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ask for you cat!
 Astrobytes: She's asleep
 LeBaoHoang8A4: SORRY, but
 Allis: The captcha just forced me to identify a mailbox as a parking meter. AI takeover is miles out.
 Gorbit99: if it works for both of you, then I need more testing Astrobytes JBM
 Gorbit99: dbdr what keyboard do you use?
 dbdr: Gorbit99: what do you mean?
 dbdr: kayboard layout?
 dbdr: US International
 dbdr: very good for programming I think
 eulerscheZahl: AltrGr works fine for me. But never tried in Vim mode
 Gorbit99: bummer
 eulerscheZahl: vim mode activated, AltGr still working
 Gorbit99: my issue is pressing altgr after f for example
 eulerscheZahl: German keyboard layout. We also need AltGr for []{}
 Gorbit99: yep
 eulerscheZahl: works just fine
 Gorbit99: huh
 dbdr: that's why it's a bad layout&#160;;)
 JBM: just write clojure
 Gorbit99: I still need my accented characters
 dbdr: áéè
 Gorbit99: now őű
 Gorbit99: I assume international has  them
 dbdr: αβγ
 Gorbit99: but then those get complex
 Gorbit99: and they are more common than []{}
 eulerscheZahl: writing my thesis in LaTeX was a pain. \frac{...} stuff
 dbdr: alt+e = é
 eulerscheZahl: \{} all need altgr
 dbdr: I use [] more often than é&#160;:)
 dbdr: but both are easy
 Gorbit99: this could be a problem on my side
 eulerscheZahl: and if i switch to another layout, i'll struggle with the office keyboard
 eulerscheZahl: disable all extensions
 Gorbit99: I'll just go into incognito
 dbdr: you can change the layout on your office one too
 dbdr: or practice with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/229ba796-4942-4f3c-81af-d8d7baf26770._SR970,300_.jpg">https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/229ba796-4942-4f3c-81af-d8d7baf26770._SR970,300_.jpg</a>&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: but i hate it when the printed label doesn't match the functionality
 eulerscheZahl: :rolling_eyes:
 tomatoes: has that kb :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: but saw that thing too on getdigital (ordered a few tshirts from there)
 dbdr: nice
 dbdr: tomatoes
 Gorbit99: doesn't work without extensions either
 Gorbit99: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://keycode.info/">https://keycode.info/</a> what does this return for altgr for you?
 Gorbit99: mine's altgraph 2 225 AltRight
 Astrobytes: altgraph 2 18 AltRight
 Gorbit99: 18?
 Gorbit99: that's...odd
 habatu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1325011ebca24c466def92312239e164eb20e79">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1325011ebca24c466def92312239e164eb20e79</a>
 dbdr: 225
 eulerscheZahl: 225 too
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't even aware that there is a website for this. i'm always using xev
 Gorbit99: shortest or reverse?
 Gorbit99: in C++ or pascal?
 Gorbit99: someone really likes to suffer, huh
 habatu: all
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl that's not the same
 dbdr: what x is getting and what the browser is getting
 dbdr: there are so many layers
 eulerscheZahl: good point
 eulerscheZahl: 18 is the normal ALT key btw
 Astrobytes: I get the same number for both sides, just different sides
 Gorbit99: xev gives me iso_level3_shift
 Gorbit99: yep, that's altgr
 Gorbit99: what editor does cg use?
 eulerscheZahl: monaco
 Gorbit99: maybe there's an answer if I search for that
 Psio: Is there a bug with CoC, i always get CodeSize today
 Psio:&#160;?
 Gorbit99: no, you're just lucky/unlucky
 Gorbit99: we can swap, I'd like to get that
 Psio: :D
 Gorbit99: monaco doesn't seem to have built in vim
 JBM: the option's still there
 Astrobytes: From discord (for our non-discordians) they use this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/brijeshb42/monaco-vim">https://github.com/brijeshb42/monaco-vim</a>
 Gorbit99: yep, quickly downloaded it and it seems there's the bug
 eulerscheZahl: patch it, make a PR
 eulerscheZahl: and then get CG to merge that into their system
 Gorbit99: I'm terrible at js, but at least I have something to do
 eulerscheZahl: exactly my thoughts when i realized that the CG SDK generates too large replays for my purposes
 eulerscheZahl: well, at first i thought i'll put a struct on this :sob:
 JBM: where's a good old struct when you need one
 eulerscheZahl: he was working on it for 2 weeks maybe
 eulerscheZahl: made some progress but never committed the code

 AntiSquid: not in main chat at least
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: lol, squid on fire!
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the 2nd kick coming
 AntiSquid: i prefer not to, but see this too often happening
 AntiSquid: if everyone floods with those links ........
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because the CoC page tells you to share this link to get more players?
 eulerscheZahl: just guessing, i'm not sure about this
 AntiSquid: there should be a designated chat-room for the clash fans for crying out loud
 AntiSquid: #clash
 AntiSquid: or something
 eulerscheZahl: there is
 Astrobytes: that's a channel
 eulerscheZahl: with a bot sharing links
 Astrobytes: that remi guy wrote a bot 
 AntiSquid: so that's the clasher's paradise, why don't they use that chat
 Astrobytes: Gathers twitch clashes
 eulerscheZahl: because lost of clashers are probably new to CG when they share links here
 eulerscheZahl: they share a link and get kicked by AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: then the next new user enters the game
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and just assume that general chat is where they're supposed to share the link
 eulerscheZahl: they don't know about #clash
 AntiSquid: yeah ok but the 2nd guy at least could have refrained
 Astrobytes: I guess a lot of users don't know about #clash, not just new ones
 eulerscheZahl: at least it was fun to wath :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: even if i felt a little sorry for those he kicked
 AntiSquid: ya it was difficult to kick an anime avatar&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: the more cultured user
 eulerscheZahl: and a japanese user. those rarely even enter the english chat
 eulerscheZahl: and tweet about getting mentioned here :D
 Astrobytes: JP Twitter will be rocked by the news that a user was kicked from general
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid's name will be tarnished forever
 habatu: hello
 Gorbit99: hi
 AntiSquid: hi
 Astrobytes: hi
 eulerscheZahl: that's the one you kicked Antolyt
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: bad tab completino&#160;:/
 Gorbit99: random guy getting tagged
 Astrobytes: Completino eh?
 AntiSquid: :D
 AntiSquid: euler sounds like a memer now
 eulerscheZahl: italian toad
 Astrobytes: Toadarino
 Putnam3145: ...
 eulerscheZahl: i'll order a pizza at your restaurant gastrobytes
 Putnam3145: i just improved my performance massively
 Astrobytes: O Toade Mioooo
 Putnam3145: i mean unbelievably hugely
 Putnam3145: by replacing an array with a linked list
 Putnam3145: other way 'round
 Putnam3145: i mean
 Putnam3145: that's it i've joined the linked list hate club
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I've used Gastrobytes before, quite enjoy that one
 AntiSquid: why do you hate linked lists?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i missed thatthought i had a new idea to make fun of your nick&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: which language are you using Putnam3145
 eulerscheZahl: anyway g2g
 Putnam3145: D, which probably does bad memory management during linked list stuff, yes
 Gorbit99: linked lists are always never the answer
 Putnam3145: the question here was
 Gorbit99: almost always*
 AntiSquid: oh a fellow D user
 Putnam3145: "which data structure should i use when I want fast insertion and deletion"
 Putnam3145: however
 Putnam3145: HOWEVER.
 Putnam3145: I forgot that order does not matter
 AntiSquid: didn't spend that much time in it but i imagine the D forum would help&#160;?
 Putnam3145: since order doesn't matter, I want an array
 Xcalibre: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo</a>
 Putnam3145: cause insertion and deletion in arrays is still O(1), as long as you do both from the back
 Putnam3145: and you can reserve all the memory for the array up-front
 Putnam3145: anyway one of the tests when from 30 ms to 287 microseconds
 Putnam3145: 30 ms to 0.287
 Putnam3145: that's so bad!
 AntiSquid: but maybe you want the flexibility of connecting / reconnecting stuff Xcalibre 
 Gorbit99: cache is an important thing you see
 Putnam3145: frigging locality, man
 Xcalibre: vector is very chache-friendly
 Xcalibre: cache*
 Putnam3145: when you forget about cache misses, you have performed a cache miss on your own productivity
 AntiSquid: which puzzle are you using D for Putnam3145&#160;?
 Shakib.M83: Hi guys
 Sergen: Shortest mode in CoC is a stupid idea.
 JBM: CoC is a stupid ida
 Sergen: lines of code does not matter whatsover and the it promotes bad practices
 Putnam3145: Surface
 Astrobytes: It's just for 'fun' Sergen
 Putnam3145: also shortest mode is like a game
 JBM: good thing it doesn't judge on loc then
 Putnam3145: lines of code doesn't matter and silly one-liners are bad, yeah
 Sergen: you can have both fun and useful
 Putnam3145: fastest isn't useful either
 Sergen: Timing matters in an interview
 Putnam3145: reverse mode is, to an extent
 Astrobytes: Fun and useful is puzzles and bot programming, CoC is just for 'fun'
 JBM: timing matters in more than just interviews
 Gorbit99: problem with timing is the languages
 Gorbit99: you can't expect someone to write the same eficiency code with different languages
 JBM: how would that be a problem?
 Gorbit99: if you read the coc faq, it says, that it's perfect to put on during your break and grind out a quick 5 minute clash where you can ignore code style
 Putnam3145: yeah it's not really a problem
 Putnam3145: CoC rewards, like
 Putnam3145: being comfortable with one language, but being flexible enough to know others
 Gorbit99: usually knowing ruby very well is enough :P
 Putnam3145: yes, true
 Putnam3145: in my experience D lets me get get a lot of the stuff faster, but that's mostly because I have the range library mostly committed to memory
 Gorbit99: ruby ranges are just 1..n
 Gorbit99: that's what you get
 Putnam3145: i mean D has the exact same thing but I mean, like
 Putnam3145: .cycle, which turns whatever range you got into an infinitely cycling range, which, to be fair, is mostly good for the exact same stuff ruby has slide(n) for
 Putnam3145: .retro, which gives you a reversed view into the given (bidirectional) range
 Putnam3145: stuff like that
 Gorbit99: ah
 Gorbit99: sounds nice
 Astrobytes: At least now there's a few serious D users on CG it's less of a meme 
 AntiSquid: who are they&#160;? aside from putnam
 Astrobytes: You
 Astrobytes: That's 2, so, a few
 AntiSquid: ah i am waiting for next contest to get serious lol :D
 AntiSquid: i mean with applying D
 AntiSquid: so far i just followed some tutorials for D at most
 Astrobytes: Seems useful enough
 Astrobytes: I'm doing some Go atm
 AntiSquid: keep forgetting, what is Go useful for specifically?
 Astrobytes: Donno
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Isn't it good with concurrency?
 Astrobytes: Think that's it
 AntiSquid: i think there was a different motivation for creating it
 JBM: that and smugness
 AntiSquid: Go performance is as good as C for the vast majority of work, and generally much faster than other languages known for speed of development (e.g., JavaScript, Python, and Ruby). Portability. Executables created with the Go toolchain can stand alone, with no default external dependencies.
 Astrobytes: I was golfing it the other day and thought I'd do some more puzzles in it.
 AntiSquid: im sorry, me? JBM?
 AntiSquid: if you mean me having an avatar unlike you, sure, but it's justified
 JBM: naaaaw, just the community
 AntiSquid: ah it's a google language right now i remember wasn't sure
 AntiSquid: Golang emerged as an alternative to C++ and Java for the app developers in the context of what Google needed for its network servers and distributed systems. The language was created to do away with the lack of pace and difficulties involved with programming for large and scalable servers and software systems.
 AntiSquid: so basically like react thingy
 JBM: i distinctly recall "fast compilations" as being a design point
 jacek: still waiting for chesslang
 Astrobytes: Presumably they didn't want to call it ogle so went with Go instead
 AntiSquid: and a hamster .
 JBM: jacek: why wait?
 AntiSquid: the hamster looks blue from all the nasty food pellets intruding its privacy
 Astrobytes: It's a gopher
 AntiSquid: is Go really as fast as C++&#160;?
 Astrobytes: 100 x faster
 Astrobytes: But seriously, I've not benchmarked it
 SonicFox: do u like Dart?
 Xcalibre: here's a link:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/go-gpp.html">https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/go-gpp.html</a>
 Astrobytes: Never used Dart properly so couldn't comment tbh
 JBM: dart was go smugness^10
 JBM: i'll never forget that guy who came present it
 JBM: overconfidence had a new master
 SonicFox: i think it's actually good
 Gorbit99: so brainfuck support when?
 Gorbit99: I hate using a different language to interpret it, makes it quite slow and tedious
 AntiSquid: i think it's planned to be released same time as white space lang support
 Astrobytes: And GORBITSA
 AntiSquid: not likely 
 tomatoes: write bf interpreter and use it 👀
 Gorbit99: there just so happens to be a new challenge about making a bf interpreter
 AntiSquid: bf interpreter in CG ide

 jrke: thanks
 DomiKo: jrke are you writing sim?
 jrke: will start writing tomorrow
 DomiKo: i'm writing since yesterday
 DomiKo: so much fun....
 jrke: k
 jrke: i didn't understand movements
 jrke: did you understand it?
 DomiKo: i guess
 FLQ4: who is grinding CoC here 
 Putnam3145: i have done so in the last day yes
 FLQ4: grinding is sorta good because it improves skill 
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo imagine the fun at fantastic bits during the contest. the referee wasn't public
 Qwerty_1331: eyo
 eulerscheZahl: only a few players even managed to reverse it. so it was a heuristics festival
 inoryy: AntiSquid some languages can reach C++ speed within some margin with clever tricks, but I don't think Go does aside from a couple of synthetic tests
 Astrobytes: Have you used it much inoryy? (Go that is)
 inoryy: briefly (not at work)
 dbdr: why would tricks be needed to be as fast as C++?&#160;;)
 JBM: funny how C++ is now the target
 JBM: reminds me of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wiki.c2.com/?AsFastAsCee">https://wiki.c2.com/?AsFastAsCee</a>
 dbdr: true
 dbdr: or C before that
 dbdr: C is too high level, you can never reach the performance of asm
 JBM: asm had different slogans
 Drihnking: ok
 dbdr: like?
 JBM: my memory is something like
 JBM: 80s: too slow? write it in asm
 JBM: 90s: too slow? compilers generate code 5 to 10% than hand-asm
 JBM: 00s: hand asm is on par with c
 JBM: 10s: don't bother trying to catch up with the compiler
 JBM: seems like 20s are in "oh but AVX" mode
 dbdr: what about AVX?
 Astrobytes: 20s: a s what?
 JBM: specialized avx-asm has to be considered again, compilers seem to have a hard time with it
 dbdr: right
 JBM: heck, even I'm still not sure what to make of it
 dbdr: there are many optimizations that C/C++ compilers cannot do, because they can't prove that some pointers don't alias
 dbdr: I think it's one of the reasons fortran can be faster than C
 JBM: it's like crazy throughput for 5 ns, then it overheats?
 JBM: it's the major one yes
 JBM: you canplay with restrict in C for some time now
 dbdr: and potential for rust too, but unfortunately LLVM does not implement that well yet
 inoryy: bit early to pronounce what 20s is about
 JBM: CMUCL/SBCL also has a great reputation for numerics
 JBM: yeah make that the last few years :D
 dbdr: time accelerates&#160;;)
 JBM: sure does
 dbdr: the 10s, the 20s, the 21s, ...
 JBM: so fast ir's depressing
 JBM: *it
 dbdr: that's exponentials for us
 inoryy: next year will be 20v2, we'll just roll back this one
 dbdr: git revert 2020
 JBM: your working copy has modified files
 dbdr: git checkout .
 dbdr: nothing too important
 eulerscheZahl: git reset --hard HEAD
 JBM: yeah i usually do that
 JBM: (without specifying HEAD)
 jacek: git commit -m suicide
 JBM:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: git push -f
 JBM: you're pushing it
 Astrobytes: What if it pushes back? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: hm, lets push it to a new branch then
 inoryy: git checkout --orphan b &amp;&amp; git branch -D master &amp;&amp; git branch -m master &amp;&amp; git push -f
 JBM: git push :master; rm -rf .
 dbdr: git reset --hard HEAD~$RANDOM # live dangerously
 eulerscheZahl: i see your russian friend is still posting walls of text
 Astrobytes: Is it Cyber back from the 'dead'?
 inoryy: probably, I quit the channel
 eulerscheZahl: wait a week or 2. then uljahn should have full mod powers
 Uljahn: :muscle:
 eulerscheZahl: :boom:
 JBM: there's a trial period for that?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :hammer:
 eulerscheZahl: nah, something went wrong
 eulerscheZahl: we are mods on world and fr
 eulerscheZahl: not on ru or de
 Uljahn: :upside_down:
 jacek: rude
 JBM: lol
 eulerscheZahl: we are also mods on #thisRandomChannelIJustMadeUp
 JBM: those are civilized places, no need for them
 Astrobytes: Is de still alive?
 eulerscheZahl: rarely
 JBM: always has "been"
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait for the next contest, then there will be a little activity
 eulerscheZahl: right now i can go back 2 weeks in #de chat history
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: vs 20 or 30min here i guess
 Astrobytes: Not always
 eulerscheZahl: true. sometimes i still see what i wrote the evening before
 eulerscheZahl: but definitely not 2 weeks
 Astrobytes: Yup. Been a wee bit more lively recently mind you
 Astrobytes: And the quest map seems to have encouraged a lot of people
 eulerscheZahl: and i took off for 2 weeks \o/
 Astrobytes: You're currently in mid-air?
 jacek: wouldnt want to save for the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 eulerscheZahl: i still have some holidays left
 eulerscheZahl: and i wanted to finish my own game
 dbdr: does a kick apply per chan, or globally?
 inoryy: per chan
 Astrobytes: per channel 
 Astrobytes: Same for ban
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy your message on de makes no sense to me. grammar is fine but i don't get the meaning of it
 JBM: the darkness outside substitutes for a tv
 dbdr: inorry's german must be too refined for you
 eulerscheZahl: Dark isn't even a word, so I parsed it as a name
 inoryy: lol
 JBM: but it's germanic, so it must have the aame words as english
 inoryy: Dark is this TV series <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856/</a>
 JBM: isn;t that how this works?
 Astrobytes: I haven't watched Dark yet
 Astrobytes: Apparently very good
 inoryy: wanted to say that "Dark is the best TV series out there"
 inoryy: (it's German)
 JBM: oh *that* out there
 eulerscheZahl: ah. draußen = outside
 inoryy: lol
 dbdr: yeah, literal translation D
 JBM: bing translate much
 inoryy: yes... bing
 dbdr: there is also a word missing for "series"
 eulerscheZahl: but thumbs up for your effort to revive the channel
 Astrobytes: You know, bing in Scottish means a heap of waste (from a mine or such)
 Astrobytes: "a heap, especially of metallic ore or of waste from a mine"
 Astrobytes: Very apt for Bing I've found
 eulerscheZahl: nothing worth harvesting at UTG
 JBM: bing's always chandler to me
 Astrobytes: Always found that and Crosby amusing.
 Astrobytes: Heap of Waste Crosby has a ring to it though
 jacek: B crosby?
 Astrobytes: Bing Crosby
 jacek: bang?
 dbdr: god, I even wrote "I kennte das" :D
 dbdr: second time
 dbdr: I swear I pronounced it "Ich" in my head
 dbdr: same as rightig :D
 Astrobytes: kennte is 'knew'? 'kent' round my region means knew, ken means know
 dbdr: at least I think it is&#160;;)
 dbdr: interesting. what is your region?
 dbdr: sounds like a mix of english and german. which makes sense of course
 Astrobytes: Central Scotland. Also used in other regions to an extent
 dbdr: you didn't learn german?
 dbdr: it's probably easier than french for english speakers
 dbdr: though there are many words of latin/french origin in english as well, but I think the germanic side often dominates
 Astrobytes: Only a little at school, regrettably. Also, we say "hoose" and "hame" for "house" and "home", which is equivalent to the Swedish "hus" and "Hem"
 jacek: schmetterling!
 tomatoes: best editor
 Astrobytes: Scots dialect that is, the English don't speak like that in the slightest
 jacek: theyre not nearly as drunk
 eulerscheZahl: kennte is 'knew'?
 Astrobytes: That's rich coming from a Pole! :P
 Astrobytes: thx for the clarification euler
 dbdr: Danke, Lehrer&#160;;)

 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: I can imagine that turning into a right old Kuddelmuddel 
 dbdr: what's that?
 Astrobytes: unstructured mess/chaos
 jacek: kogel mogel?
 Astrobytes: Just came across it
 Astrobytes: That's some Polish food jacek, no?
 dbdr: kagel magus?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogel_mogel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogel_mogel</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'm all for replacing "th" by "z" :Dor "f"
 jacek: and here goes NN success in another game
 Astrobytes: which?
 jacek: breakthrough
 Astrobytes: Nice. Same techniques?
 jacek: yes, NN as eval
 jacek: though learning was exclusively supervised from the standard eval bot
 jacek: temporal difference learning and the like so far completely fail in breakthrough
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure TDL has been used successfully in Breakthrough
 jacek: well there is paper when they learned 3x3, 4x4 tuples and put for their mcts eval but it was a bit weaker than their original bot
 Astrobytes: OK, perhaps that's the one I've seen
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321991759_Machine_Learning_in_the_Game_of_Breakthrough">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321991759_Machine_Learning_in_the_Game_of_Breakthrough</a>
 Astrobytes: yeah that's it
 jacek: i got quite good results with ntuples for breakthrough, like 90% winrate vs my bot in 1-ply
 jacek: but dunno, maybe it was overfitted, but more plies were meh
 jacek: there is new kink in chess community, NNUE. generally NN as eval, but quite fast because NN is incrementally update
 jacek: they made stockfish NNUE and its already getting like +100 elo stronger now
 Astrobytes: I was just gonna mention Stockfish, I saw that
 jacek: funny thing they use very similar learning methods as I do now
 jacek: get gazillion positions, let the engine analyze to some depth, and let the NN learn those evaluations
 Astrobytes: Try this on Atari Go
 jacek: i need to make sim first
 jacek: do you use bitboard already?
 Astrobytes: I've not even written a sim yet
 Hjax: oh are we bored of othello already? 
 jacek: dbdr ruined the fun&#160;:(
 Hjax: unbeatable, solved the game lol
 Astrobytes: I'll get back to it soon
 Astrobytes: hi btw Hjax
 Hjax: i never ended up writing ntuples
 Hjax: my motivation goes in and out 
 Astrobytes: Didn't see you around much recently
 Hjax: yeah, i do that
 Hjax: get interested in something, work on it for a few weeks, get bored, find something else to do 
 Astrobytes: All good, I know how that one goes
 jacek: so do i, though sometimes its more than few weeks
 jacek: right now im at this phase on machine learning, i again consider buy new ryzen with gazillion cores
 Hjax: ill buy a bazillion core ryzen when the 4000 series desktop chips come out 
 jacek: and when would that be
 inoryy: cheaper to go with cloud
 Hjax: hopefully this fall 
 Astrobytes: Those the Zen 3 ones?
 jacek: zen 4
 Hjax: no, zen 3
 Hjax: 4000 is zen 3 
 jacek: eh the naming
 Hjax: because 1000 was zen, 2000 was zen+, and 3000 was zen2 
 Hjax: tech companies suck at naming things 
 inoryy: zen and zen+ are two generations but on the same platform
 jacek: hopefully intel will respond to that. dont wanna another cpu stagnation
 Hjax: intel just delayed 7nm again 
 Hjax: so its not looking good for them
 Hjax: amd is going to be on 5 nm when intel is on 14
 jacek: inoryy do you work for cloud company?
 Astrobytes: ...
 jacek: does he?
 Astrobytes: Google DeepMind
 jacek: so... yes?
 Astrobytes: Last I checked he wasn't working at the cloud services sales desk
 dbdr: though he was advertising for them&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Always does :D
 Hjax: he didnt say which cloud, time to use azure :P
 eulerscheZahl: is "use the cloud" the new "5 lines of Ruby ezpz"?
 Astrobytes: It is now! 
 dbdr: five lines of cloud sounds more poetic to me
 JBM: with a silver lining
 Hjax: one line of python ezpz
 Hjax: import cloud
 Astrobytes: Use the cloud, Lucy
 dbdr: ^
 dbdr: &lt;&gt;
 JBM: whoa calm down on #de there
 dbdr: the diamond operator
 JBM: you're gonna overflow the log
 Astrobytes: lol dbdr
 JBM: ^^^^^^B^^^^^
 JBM: (The famous bee in the caret patch)
 Astrobytes: dear god
 dbdr: yeah, you had to explain that one :D
 JBM: innit
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Jbm what's this then? &lt;;-'&gt;
 Astrobytes: PAINANDSUFFERING -&#160;?! Better than EEEEEEEEtc I suppose
 Astrobytes: PaS isn't as good as MCU though
 jacek: marvel cinamtic universe?
 Scarfield: Maliously Cryptic Username
 jacek: My Cittle Uony
 Astrobytes: Minimum coded unit
 Astrobytes: My Coat Undulates
 Scarfield: how to reverse your coat back to normal then - unundulate it :thinking:
 jacek: taoc
 JBM: motorised combat unit
 Astrobytes: Un-undulating would mean I stays still?
 Astrobytes: *it
 Scarfield: lol did know undulating was actually i word, and nice one JBMCU
 PAINANDSUFFERING: lol
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Thx for the suggestion scarfield
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: hehe
 Scarfield: np
 Scarfield: undulat = budgerigar in danish
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: o.O
 Astrobytes: Is that because of the shape or the way it flies Budgiefield?
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Serious question!
 Scarfield: undulatus, from Latin unda ‘a wave’.
 Astrobytes: oh, undulatus, I'm no ornithologist
 Astrobytes: So I was correct. And yes, I looked it up
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: e
 Astrobytes: Stop that 'e' nonsense
 Scarfield: apparently its because of the pattern of its feathers
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I can see thaty
 Astrobytes: *that
 Astrobytes: Like the restless sea viewed from above
 Astrobytes: How poetic
 Scarfield: poetisch
 eulerscheZahl: Stop that 'e' nonsense
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ulrschZahl
 Astrobytes: no, that's good e
 Astrobytes: PAINANDSUFFRING
 Scarfield: switched name, so you are actually writing weird stuff in chat, at least for people who have joined since the name changing :D
 Astrobytes: oh ok, meh
 Astrobytes: Is this the face of concern?
 eulerscheZahl: i can still tab-complete PAINANDSUFFERING
 eulerscheZahl: mali... doesn't work
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: MaliciouslyCrypticUsername
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Works for me
 Astrobytes: MaliciouslyCrypticUsername
 Scarfield: ze CG works in mysterious ways
 Astrobytes: I refreshesd
 Astrobytes: Or refreshed
 eulerscheZahl: was just wondering if it auto-updates now. as i can see a list of all participants and not just actively typing ones
 eulerscheZahl: which already caused a few failed tab completions and unjustified pings
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even know that so many people are online at once
 Astrobytes: btw MaliciouslyCrypticUsername, PANDAFIEDSURFING would've been a nice alternative name
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ingesanagram.appspot.com/">https://ingesanagram.appspot.com/</a>
 Astrobytes: I did that by hand
 Astrobytes: Grenadian puffins tho
 Astrobytes: "fears funding pain" &lt;-- the winner
 eulerscheZahl: fair feuds panning
 Astrobytes: spear finding faun
 Scarfield: bah, spent a few hours today trying to figure out why my mars lander GA wont work, managed to ignore chat for most of the time, but i give up for today, firing sap unfaded
 Astrobytes: Spear finding faun is not on the list!
 Astrobytes: Ask DomiKo Scarfield :D
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: faun fries padding
 Scarfield: "Spear finding faun" lacks a "d" for one
 Astrobytes: oh my original one had 2 d's
 Astrobytes: PAINANDSUFFERING does not
 Scarfield: i was using PANDAFIEDSURFING 
 Astrobytes: so PANDAFIEDSURFING  is wrong
 Scarfield: hmm has euler started using dbdrs ways of distracting with chat :p
 Astrobytes: meh, I'm just as unfocused as I was before
 jacek: whats dbdr ways?
 Scarfield: using chat to distract, and thereby gain an even further lead
 Scarfield: neinCek ways are making pony references
 jacek: :E
 Schwase: theres an issue with the discussion page for kaprekars routine puzzle
 JBM: too many pointless comments?
 Astrobytes: Or doesn't exist?

 Astrobytes: Will report the error on discord
 jacek: or celestia
 JBM: the official bugtracker
 Astrobytes: yeah innit&#160;:/
 jacek: innit?
 JBM: innit.
 Schwase: oh they duplicated the domain
 Schwase: innit indeed
 jacek: whats innit x_X
 JBM: why don't you open it to find out?
 Astrobytes: UK slang for "isn't it"
 Astrobytes: innit
 Astrobytes: bruv
 Astrobytes: get me
 jacek: so its like eeyup?
 Astrobytes: No
 Putnam3145: you'd use it in almost the exact situations you'd use "isn't it"
 Putnam3145: if you were to use that as conversational filler
 Astrobytes: Kinda used like eeyup actually now I think on it, depending on situation
 Astrobytes: (and location - very much a London ting y'get me)
 Allis: We say "innit" in the southern US.
 Astrobytes: Form of "ain't it"?
 Allis: I suppose so.
 Allis: it's closer to "idnit" in many places, so maybe not.
 Astrobytes: we've got "isn't it", "in't it" , "ain't it" and "innit" so not far off
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out. Catch you all tomorrow no doubt
 JBM: no doubt, innit
 AntiSquid: some people actually say "init?" :D
 AntiSquid: nvm i am too late to the party, how are you Automaton2000 where is everyone gone
 Automaton2000: i got the code to solve the puzzle
 RedFox0x20: o/
 AggYzz: what is a validtor when contributing?
 Gorbit99: the testcases the users won't see AggYzz
 Gorbit99: or solvers rather
 Gorbit99: they should be similar to their test counterpart, but distinct enough as to get rid of hardcoding
 bpeter: :flag_ao:
 Dlx: why is it sometimes allowed to start a clash quickly, and sometimes not???
 Dlx: ...is it possible to select not to have "shortest" as one of the random puzzles in clash?
 st1nn: @Dix I think it depends if you are the "host"/creator of the clash, i.e. the first in the lobby.
 PYMASTER: aaff
 Dlx: ah, st1nn, that is strange, I would think it was if all agreed, then it would start early ;p
 st1nn: ok, that's how I thought it works anyway. not sure. 
 Allis: Clashes start when the "host" chooses to launch prematurely or as soon as there are eight players, whichever comes first.
 Allis: With one minor stipulation: if there are fewer than 4 seconds left before launch and a new player joins, the timer goes back to 4.

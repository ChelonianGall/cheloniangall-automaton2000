 jrke: board size?
 eulerscheZahl: tron has a 30x20 map i think
 eulerscheZahl: so just combine 2x2 blocks to 1 cell and you are fine :D
 jrke: oh ya tron 30x20.
 jrke: can anybody tell me what is MCTS
 theartist100: MCTS: SQL Server 2008 - Database Development. This MCTS certificate is designed for database developers who create programs that run in conjunction with SQL Server 2008 databases. Certification candidates can develop solutions and write SQL Server 2008 application code in an enterprise setting. MCTS: Windows 7 - Configuration
 theartist100: according to the internet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why is no one showing up in online participants?  Discord?
 dbdr: Monte Carlo Tree Search, jrke
 jrke: I know the full form dbdr i wanna know how it works.
 dbdr: wikipedia has a decent explanation as I remember
 dbdr: you can surely find other articles
 jrke: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jrke you doing tron?
 jrke: not now,currently i will work little bit on Langton ant and next pacman 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oic, i made it to legend in tron using voroni flooding like dijsktra
 jrke: hmm..
 PatrickMcGinnisII: voroni is basically just an manhattan distance to player head
 jrke: ya i learned that few days ago
 jrke: nearest player own that cell nearly this is vornoi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like i said, can get to legend using voroni, but you do have to flood to make sure you enter area with most volume
 jrke: yeah that will be my main moto.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a simtree is possible, but not necessary
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ants, i didn't do great
 jrke: my current bot in tron is mess its depth one sim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pacman is totally sim, but speed ups screwed my brain.  Switching types alone...not so bad
 jrke: yeah
 jrke: you are in wood 4 in ant right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lemme see
 jrke: yesterday i spended 2 hours on langton ant went wood 4 to wood 1 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ooh, yup didn't put any effort into it...yet
 jrke: oh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, i simmed 20k randoms, played each one out and scored them... not good enought o get out of wood 4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so unless you can run 1M randoms... decisions have to be made
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my suggestion, sim on your machine and then drop moves into CG
 jrke: noop  i was getting some 22-25k sims 
 jrke: in depth 5
 jrke: langon ant
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you are 28th, not good enough?
 jrke: no those stats was when i crossed wood 4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll get out of wood4 when i sim it on my machine.  i got other projects
 jrke: ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i usually do puzzles to get away from the in-depth stuff unless I have 2-3 days to obsess over them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gl, when u do good let me know
 jacek: good morning

 Xcalibre: for some reason, i'm not being able to claim my xp for the third-last clash of code quest, despite having fulfilled the requirement
 Xcalibre: and unlike the other buttons on the quest map, clicking this one brings up the ranking statistics panel instead of redirecting me to the clash of code page
 Xcalibre: could someone help me out?
 AntiSquid: wow clash really is annoying:
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/419d7cc8-f46b-488a-afc6-411352aa5f74">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/419d7cc8-f46b-488a-afc6-411352aa5f74</a>
 dbdr: Invalid paste id, perhaps it expired?
 Xcalibre: i get the same message
 AntiSquid: pastebin bugged again
 AntiSquid: anyways was doing revers, thought it's just to find what the repeating sequence is, turns out that wasn't really it

 dbdr: did you paste the pastebin URL of a URL? :D
 AntiSquid: ugh thought it would work out the box like imgur
 AntiSquid: reporting bad UX
 amir12: Hello
 AntiSquid: @_@ zzzz
 amir12: :angry:
 AntiSquid: wasn't directed at you
 Memo12334: how do I close this
 Memo12334: nvm
 AntiSquid: CTRL + W
 crystal_prince: hey guys i am so stuck in this code
 dbdr: AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: lucker
 dbdr: sure, must be luck :D
 AntiSquid: yes, you enjoy clash, i don't, i don't know couldn't come up with better joke
 Zenoscave: Y'all doing Class Sill?
 AntiSquid: i am wasting my life doing clash if that's what you are asking Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: Well then stop&#160;;)
 dbdr: you've done 500+ already
 AntiSquid: those were instant quits for achievement lol
 AntiSquid: now i need to clear the path T_T
 AntiSquid: and i get captchas too
 MSmits: trying to do the puzzle of the week
 dbdr: you get punished for your instant quits
 MSmits: so many words
 MSmits: can i just output TLDR
 AntiSquid: probably, i think it affects the ladder climb
 dbdr: you can MSmits
 MSmits: kk
 AntiSquid: i get only like +0.5 per win
 dbdr: print("TLDR")
 AntiSquid: seems others get top 1000 with few games
 MSmits: thanks dbdr
 dbdr: sure, you taught the system you are terrible at clash
 dbdr: robostac got top 25 in 50 clashes
 MSmits: cant you just play hundreds of clashes and record the solutions
 dbdr: what for?
 MSmits: faster :P
 RoboStac: you can complete the entire clash path in 51 clashes&#160;:)
 Insufficient: i wonder what the clash elo scoring system is and how severe the updating decay is
 RoboStac: (and then accidently queue for a 52nd due to not paying attention and getting used to clicking queue)
 dbdr: lol
 Insufficient: yh i completed the clash path with 84 clashes
 MSmits: thats still a lot of clashes
 RoboStac: yeah, but it's not enough to ever see a duplicate
 dbdr: so achivements are retroactive
 MSmits: RoboStac what if you are totally crap at it
 dbdr: I need to do 50 now, don't know what's after
 RoboStac: lots of quests based on winning clashes
 RoboStac: but no more that need you to play more
 dbdr: just won 5 in a row
 dbdr: hopefully that's enough&#160;:)
 MSmits: nice
 RoboStac: well, thats one of them out of the way then&#160;:)
 Insufficient: another thing is the clashes are quite dependent on who else is playing
 MSmits: I'm slow. I did one clash and was 4th out of 6 =/
 dbdr: I prefer the golf ones
 Insufficient: in terms of how hard it is to win loads in a row
 dbdr: can take your time in 15 minutes
 AntiSquid: i was first, but dbdr lucked out MSmits
 MSmits: aha
 dbdr: I was 0th then&#160;;)
 RoboStac: yeah, he did that to me yesterday too AntiSquid
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 dbdr: a golf I think
 MSmits: with golf you really need to know what language to pick
 dbdr: this one was funny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13071231bfd2b61d1fb4129093586f07d15c558">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13071231bfd2b61d1fb4129093586f07d15c558</a>
 dbdr: is that publicly visible?
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: python is easier for me
 dbdr: ruby can squeeze a few more characters usually
 MSmits: a few less you mean
 dbdr: guy obviously had it prerecorded
 MSmits: Allis?
 dbdr: more characters squeeze out
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: 33 chars in one minute
 dbdr: barely enough to read the task
 MSmits: true
 dbdr: so it was satisfying to create a better solution from scratch&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah of course
 dbdr: robo, special reason why 51 is needed?
 dbdr: and not 50
 RoboStac: needed an extra fastest win 
 RoboStac: didn't get many during my first 50
 dbdr: below 3 minutes?
 RoboStac: 3 fastest wins total
 RoboStac: only had 2 after the 50
 dbdr: ah
 dbdr: let's see if I can beat your record
 dbdr: you probably have the "fastest clash path" record&#160;;)
 Marchete: veterans playing CoC...
 dbdr: not me, i'm a noob
 Marchete: I don't even have 50coc yet...
 AntiSquid: what game should i make for the contribution path Automaton2000?&#160;:/
 Automaton2000: im working on my bot
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/521305b1951d46109f6885a77f38bd24a85c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/521305b1951d46109f6885a77f38bd24a85c</a>
 Zenoscave: Does this look even remotely acceptable
 Zenoscave:&#160;???
 dbdr: what's wrong with it?
 Zenoscave: It's mine, Nothing's wrong I hope
 Zenoscave: I'm just wondering if it's a good contribution
 dbdr: ah ok, I thought you were outraged :D
 Zenoscave: Not at all&#160;:)
 dbdr: that's what&#160;??? implied for me
 Zenoscave: WEll, does it look like a decent start? There's a few edits  needed probably
 SPDene: initial thought: not everyone will know what "hexit" is. maybe change to "hexit (hexadecimal digit)"&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Yeah I thought about that
 RoboStac: make sure one of the testcases has a-f as an answer not just the validators so people don't get stuck on not noticing the lower case part.
 Zenoscave: Good Point!
 dbdr: it's when hexa wants to quit the number line
 Zenoscave: I need to find a tighter bound on N. I was able to solve 100,000 but 2^32 time's out. perhaps just saying 100K is enough?
 SPDene: the formula doesn't wrap. the RHS is only visible in the IDE if I zoom out to (really tiny text). maybe split it onto more than one line
 dbdr: or accept both lower and uppercase
 dbdr: ah, but the framework can't I guess
 Zenoscave: can you accept both? I didn't know that possibility is available in CG
 Zenoscave: The formula is a placeholder for until i find an image
 Zenoscave: (With proper licensing)
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave farming achievements?
 dbdr: nah, surely a coincidence
 Zenoscave: not farming. Just doing quests. I still want high quality contributions though
 eulerscheZahl: problem looks familiar to me
 Zenoscave: Is it a duplicate!?
 Zenoscave: oh no&#160;:(
 RoboStac: I'm pretty sure I've not seen it before so I don't think it's been on cg (unless it's a clash)
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm confusing it with this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/623cdd0d2ed37cc82b4010cfdb46d4cdcbe">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/623cdd0d2ed37cc82b4010cfdb46d4cdcbe</a>
 Zenoscave: different formula and purpose
 eulerscheZahl: as you can see i had some fun in the comment section, which is probably why i remember it.and yeah, your formula is different
 dbdr: it's the same PI though
 dbdr: change it
 Zenoscave: Ok I'll do Pi^3
 Zenoscave: thhere's a similar Spigot algo for it
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 dbdr: I was joking, it's good
 Zenoscave: As was I :D
 eulerscheZahl: i still won't give it 5 stars for innovativeness
 Zenoscave: That's fair, I didn't try super hard. Just wondering if it's acceptable
 dbdr: looks good to me
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i like the contribute quest: motivates to spam contributions and to accept pending ones (another quest)the future will tell us
 JBM: and write void comments
 Zenoscave: If Anti playing CoC says anything...
 JBM: i had the same gut  reaction
 eulerscheZahl: " Just wondering if it's acceptable"looking at other puzzles: yes, it is acceptable
 Zenoscave: I will probably delete if it isn't up to snuff. I don't want to make it too low brow of a puzzle
 JBM: blame the system
 JBM: get your xp, move on
 SPDene: I definitely agree with dbdr's comment (add more large numbers). I hate the idea that you could get 6/8 correct by just "knowing" the first 11 digits
 JBM: it'll get cleaned up if it garners bad ratings
 Zenoscave: I missed that comment SPDene and dbdr thanks!
 SPDene: it's a comment on the contribution
 eulerscheZahl: just my personal opinion which doesn't always correlate with CG opinion. it will make an average community puzzle, not an outstanding one
 eulerscheZahl: and that makes it boring to me personally
 dbdr: the formula is quite cool actually
 dbdr: on the mathy side, obviously
 Zenoscave: I agree I enjoy the math behind it but the task is fairly easy
 dbdr: not the formula, but the fact you can do that
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but the task here is to code a known formula
 dbdr: yeah, might classify as easy
 Zenoscave: I don't give the formula in a form that can be achievable for all validators. You need to understand some optimization (modular exponentiation, and what not)
 eulerscheZahl: to explain it with another example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/772c7ba1e7a696fd49cda703bc860b03cde">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/772c7ba1e7a696fd49cda703bc860b03cde</a>
 eulerscheZahl: to me the puzzle would be more fun if you have to figure out the algo yourself. the statement already tells you to use CYK
 dbdr: oh, then not easy
 eulerscheZahl: then i revoke some of my concerns
 eulerscheZahl: @ "You need to understand some optimization"
 Zenoscave: Perhaps try the puzzle and see what you think?
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, totally not in a mood :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm better at talking smart on the chat
 Zenoscave: sounds like a fair mood assessment to me&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: You can also squeak the system by upvoting your own contribution (only 4 others need to upvote not 5) 
 Zenoscave: just found out on accident
 eulerscheZahl: reported years ago
 Zenoscave: Is it known to be non-reversible?
 Zenoscave: (un-voting doesn't drop it)
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 Zenoscave: ok I'll just not upvote it again for now
 MSmits: ohh it's a hard puzzle. For some reason I figured the puzzle of the week should be easy, but of course they can also be hard =/
 MSmits: I have the solution I think though, gonna try and code it in python
 Zenoscave: It was an interesting one though, That player makes good one
 Zenoscave: *ones
 MSmits: yeah once i figured out how to do it and that it is tricky, i thought it was a good puzzle. 
 MSmits: easy puzzles should be short, but hard puzzles may be a bit wordy thats ok
 dbdr: I don't mind an easy puzzle where deciphering the description is most of the task
 dbdr: if it's written creatively
 dbdr: à la JBM
 MSmits: yeah I guess it depends on what's written
 Zenoscave: Those are good ones too
 MSmits: I don't like to read 2 pages of text just to find out I need to output the 2nd highest number in a list though :p
 Zenoscave: Is it always the second though&#160;;)
 MSmits: the nth highest, 
 MSmits: maybe
 Zenoscave: perhaps
 dbdr: [2 pages of story]And your task, my friend, is to say "Hello, world!"
 MSmits: lol right
 Zenoscave: I'd rage quit at that point
 Zenoscave: wouldn't even go for the free xp
 JBM: ironically, grravity rtumbler tuning is rated much higher than hooch clash
 MSmits: dont remember hooch clash
 MSmits: I remember the gravity one though, that was a nice one
 eulerscheZahl: i remember it :sream:
 JBM: maybe it got kicked out by now
 eulerscheZahl: still there
 JBM: it;s mostly a question of "did people realize how simple it was"
 Zenoscave: I don't recall the problem either
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/cGkDu4.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/cGkDu4.jpg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: find some a,b,c,d for a^3+b^3 = c^3+d^3
 eulerscheZahl: i don't remember the exact task
 Zenoscave: booo 
 dbdr: wasn't there something on numberphile about centrifuges?
 JBM: yes, centrifuge balancing
 Zenoscave: Is that the genesis of the problem?
 JBM: not the gravity ones
 JBM: another one came up
 Sh4d0W: hey guys
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/gravity-tumbler">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/gravity-tumbler</a>&#160;?
 JBM: i'm getting confused
 JBM: i think the surprisingly easy one is centrifuge, not centrifuge tuning
 JBM: tuning is the surprisingly interesting one
 dbdr: JBM confused himself? :D
 JBM: it's been some time
 JBM: how old are these puzzles
 dbdr: You Are In a Maze of Twisty Little Puzzles, All Alike
 eulerscheZahl: i'm confused too
 eulerscheZahl: i think the ordering of the published solutions changed from user rank to recent submits.but CG says no
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even care about the ordering. but do i see changes when there are none?
 JBM: i never understood the ordering
 eulerscheZahl: i always thought: upvotes, then user rank
 JBM: i thought it was weirder than that
 JBM: like votes, then userid
 JBM: but i never checked anything, i just remained confused
 eulerscheZahl: not it seems to be upvotes, then date
 JBM: oh
 JBM: well why not
 JBM: seems fairest of them all
 eulerscheZahl: gives everyone a chance to be seen
 eulerscheZahl: and those who comment will do on recent code. you don't help me by criticizing what i wrote 3 years ago
 JBM: you get criticism?
 eulerscheZahl: rarely but yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and i doubt i can find it again
 SPDene: eulerZahl's weak point: "not very good at finding old criticism"  :P :P
 SPDene: sorry- got your name wrong there
 Astrobytes: type e or eu then Tab to autocomplete
 eulerscheZahl: hah!<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tnx73w">https://prnt.sc/tnx73w</a>
 dbdr: I suspect there is a cycle of (This puzzle is a “harder” version of community puzzle “X”. You may want to solve that one first.) links :D
 eulerscheZahl: is there a topologic sorting of puzzle difficulties?
 eulerscheZahl: you should make a new contribution on this
 JBM: if there was, we wouldn'y be whining about miscategorization all the time
 dbdr: original 3 line solution for Gravity Tumbler
 dbdr: but it's haskell, so I think it counts as "long"&#160;;)
 JBM: yeah it's not golfed in the submission
 JBM: it's there so approvers can understand
 dbdr: I'm not sure who does
 JBM: i don't think i put the "smart" solution in centrifuge though
 JBM: must have been the period where people got the haskell achievement by copy-pasting author solutions from my puzzles
 JBM: *sigh*
 dbdr: not worse that calling python from bash
 dbdr: :rolling_eyes:
 JBM: i'd say it is
 JBM: but i'm not currently clashing
 dbdr: to get the achievement I mean
 dbdr: in golfing, anything goes
 dbdr: I won't name a currently top 2 but not top 1 player who did that&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i tried to compile java and decompile to clojure, didn't work&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i still miss the clojure achievement
 dbdr: way harder than just write clojure
 eulerscheZahl: that's your opinion
 dbdr: well, esp given it did not work :D
 JBM: yeah, i'd be more likely to get the java achievement by transpiling clojure than the converse
 eulerscheZahl: we need more puzzles like number shifting and CGFunge Prime
 dbdr: it would actually be somewhat cool, if it's not trivial
 dbdr: lol
 JBM: didn't i get a d badge by doing something dirty?
 JBM: i already forgot
 dbdr: you should be able to create a class from bytecode at runtime, by the way
 dbdr: no need to generate source&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but the interpreter has to be in clojure then&#160;:(
 JBM: cg doesn't take .class
 eulerscheZahl: you can ship your own VM
 dbdr: but you can generate a class using the JDK
 dbdr: feed the bytes to it
 dbdr: which you generated offline
 eulerscheZahl: like i could write brainfuck code for 15 puzzles and then 1 interpreter for each language to get all achievements
 JBM: seems harder than 15 easy puzzles
 dbdr: sure
 eulerscheZahl: but more fun too :D
 JBM: certainly
 dbdr: BF VM is actually very simple
 dbdr: write one in lojure, euler&#160;;)
 JBM: "actually"
 JBM: like you're teaching us somthing there
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure there are some online :P
 dbdr: not you
 JBM: not him either :p
 dbdr: ah,  I think I misread one line, sorry
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'll complete some language achievements now
 eulerscheZahl: D and Typescript are open too
 JBM: later is always an easier time for those
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pyr/brainfuck">https://github.com/pyr/brainfuck</a>
 dbdr: there you go
 JBM: especially now some trivial puzzles are going to come raining in with the quests
 eulerscheZahl: i might have to change the , to my needs
 dbdr: fork it
 dbdr: would it count as obfuscated in a contest?&#160;;)
 dbdr: I would say no, as it would be hard to hide a copy-paste
 dbdr: also hard to write a bot that matters
 MSmits: yay algorithmic expert 
 JBM: gratz
 MSmits: puzzle of the week was apparently the only thing i had to do in that branch
 JBM: i'm still confused why i hadn't
 JBM: when they created the puzzle of the week achievement, we had to resubmmit to get it
 JBM: and here... no
 MSmits: yeah.. i did puzzles of the week before
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still confused why they couldn't just check for us having that achievement already
 MSmits: just not since they implemented quest map
 MSmits: makes more sense indeed euler
 JBM: i had puzzles of the week before, also not since there's the map
 JBM: but i *had* solved this week's puzzle earlier when it wasn't puzzle of the week
 MSmits: ahh thats it then
 eulerscheZahl: you lost that achievement temporarily?
 MSmits: they just check for the current puzzle of the week, not for the achievement
 JBM: because reasons
 dbdr: CG moves in mysterious ways
 G-Rom: JBM, it's to give you a little quest to do. If we hadn't do that, you will have complain that it's just a cookie clicked game and you have nothing to do :P 
 JBM: what is?
 JBM: i literally had nothing to do for that one
 [CG]Thibaud: achievements computation is triggered by a submit, and quests work differently
 darkhorse64: Binary Neural Network is really hard when it's your first time NN. The statement is correct but it must be read very carefully. 6 hours debugging + googling
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: that's dedication darkhorse64
 jjhiggz: I swear I got this question last second, all test scores right and didn't have time to press submit
 darkhorse64: I want to understand the damned thing. 
 MSmits: does it teach you how to do a NN?
 JBM: in a way
 [CG]Thibaud: jjhiggz in Clash I guess. In this case, you have the choice to submit your latest play of tests or your current code in IDE. Did you have that popup?
 darkhorse64: From what I have seen, it's only scratching the surface but you get the basics. To be completed with a more in depth tutorial
 MSmits: cool
 darkhorse64: The hard partt is understanding backpropagation
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: mathy
 darkhorse64: and use auto&amp; in loops
 MSmits: never learned what that does
 eulerscheZahl: auto is like var in C#
 MSmits: some kind of auto typed reference
 MSmits: yeah i knew that
 MSmits: but the &amp; makes it weird
 darkhorse64: eg for (auto node:nodes) loops on all members of a container
 MSmits: nice
 darkhorse64: but uses them by value
 eulerscheZahl: i remember missing that &amp;, took me way too long to see it
 MSmits: values vs reference causes a lot of bugs
 darkhorse64: I did it twice
 MSmits: i just did the puzzle of the week in python and was struggling mightily to make a floodfill, among other things value vs references in lists and sets
 MSmits: solved it with binary search &amp; floodfill, is that how you guys did it?
 darkhorse64: For this puzzle, you have to print the shortest distance between two stations in your network
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: the binary search finds this value
 MSmits: floodfill finds the connected stations with the current value
 darkhorse64: If you pick the shortest between any station without searching, what happens&#160;?
 MSmits: it's too low, all stations need to be connected
 MSmits: if A and B are close and C and D are close, but the two groups are far apart, then they are not connected
 darkhorse64: Just trying to cheat, like the nqueens puzzle
 MSmits: i'm not sure if there is an easier way than mine
 MSmits: but basically you're allowed s clumps of stations, connected by sattelite. if you do the floodfill you count the number of clumps of stations by the number of floods
 darkhorse64: The magic words are Kruskal/Prim
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: what do they mean
 jacek: the safe word?
 Astrobytes: minimum spanning tree MSmits
 MSmits: doesnt sound like the same thing
 MSmits: you dont minimize the total connection length
 MSmits: you minimize the shortest distance in any particular connection between 2 stations
 MSmits: not the total length of all connections
 MSmits: basically you set a wifi max distance
 MSmits: and check if this is enough to connect all stations
 MSmits: or at least, to get no more clumps than allowed by the number of sattelite connections
 darkhorse64: tbh, I do not understand well the puzzle, I have been focused exclusively on the NN puzzle
 MSmits: no, the puzzle is a bit weird
 MSmits: most puzzles with connections feature "wires" 
 MSmits: this is a wifi connection, so you're automatically connected to everything in range
 MSmits: and everything connected to that
 MSmits: so floodfill makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: are you still talking about the NN puzzle?
 MSmits: nah the puzzle of the week
 darkhorse64: The goal eludes me a bit. I would have expected to print the graph or the graph length
 MSmits: it's pretty cool
 jrke: can anybody tell me how can i pass pacman silver
 MSmits: yeah, thats the thing, there is no graph
 MSmits: well there is a graph after you set the wifi distance
 eulerscheZahl: did that long ago but i think i liked it
 MSmits: but the graph shrinks when you lower that distance, connections being broken
 darkhorse64: Now NN part 2 or maybe a break
 MSmits: if you set the distance really high, everything is connected to everything
 eulerscheZahl: "long" = 4 monthsjust bad memory then
 eulerscheZahl: jrke <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113</a>
 MSmits: yeah try that thread. It's almost always better than questions here 
 MSmits: pacman has many approaches
 jacek: :v
 Shahariar: Hi:relaxed:
 MSmits: lol,  I joined a clash and 2 people left. Come on guys, i am crap
 jrke: ah lemme join
 MSmits: it's my 2nd clash ever
 jrke: :smiley: what 2nd
 MSmits: ye
 jacek: so virgin
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i still need that top1k achievement&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but is it worth the effort?
 TheSpiffiest: kinda neat... just biked 25 miles and haven't eaten yet today. Did code clash and could no figure out basic division in 15 minutes.
 TheSpiffiest: walking dead
 TheSpiffiest: is this what it's like to not know how to code?&#160;:)
 jacek: meh, intermittent fasting is good for my brain
 jrke: can i apply vornoi in pac?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. you can also apply a ray tracing NN
 Xcalibre: remember that one
 MSmits: why cant i check if a character is equal to '\'  in C#?
 Xcalibre: '\\'
 MSmits:             else if (c == '\')
 jacek: escape char?
 MSmits: hmm ok
 jacek: clash?
 MSmits: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: does @'\' work too is is that just for strings?
 MSmits: yeah
 D-Ortea: \\o//
 jrke: MSmits still in that clash
 MSmits: tried that eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: not gonna make it i think
 eulerscheZahl: screw it, /me will join a CoC for top1k
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i missed the start
 MSmits: well i made 2nd lol
 MSmits: couldnt get last testcase in time
 MSmits: aww nope 3rd
 jacek: so clash is the new hype now?
 MSmits: can you submit multiple times in shortest mode clash?
 Xcalibre: nope
 MSmits: well then i beat one guy already :P
 Xcalibre: Tychkorg is a bot
 DomiKo: :joy:
 MSmits: still a player solution
 MSmits: so i am just asynchronously beating him
 wlesavo: lol, chat got tricked into CoC, the best example of gamification effectiveness
 Xcalibre: anything for xp
 Logiman09: Why this keep popping up?
 Logiman09: :confused:
 jacek: what
 Logiman09: this chat thingy It keeps popping up
 Logiman09: I don't know why
 eulerscheZahl: weird clash. i tried to shorten it and broke functionality, only got 62% correct. still won
 DomiKo: shorten mode is the worst one, because you have to wait 15 min to get result&#160;:(
 DomiKo: not cool&#160;:(
 jacek: aww
 MSmits: aw damnit, 45 characters, thibaud beat me with 43&#160;:)
 Xcalibre: could u share ur code?
 MSmits: sorry not for clashes, I automatically share my easy puzzle soloutions though, crappy as they are
 Xcalibre: oh ok
 MSmits: well, let me share this one
 MSmits: its not that great anyway
 Xcalibre: thnx :smiley:
 [CG]Thibaud: hehe
 Xcalibre: oh forgot that python trick
 MSmits: i also forgot i could have done &gt; instead of ==
 MSmits: so at least 1 less character
 MSmits: btw, almost every trick i used i googled during the 15 min
 MSmits: i didnt know how to do this kind of if/else in python
 Xcalibre: i see :D
 pedrosorio: @kayou nice
 Narek__: can anyone guese where to start:

 JBM: !ban
 jacek: the atari go contribution will soon expire
 jacek: is it ready?
 Laminator: damn equal sign cost me the win lol
 Astrobytes: afaik it's ready jacek
 jacek: then approve it *.*
 Astrobytes: I don't have a bot for it so, no
 eulerscheZahl: you can approve it jacek
 AntiSquid: "win" in clash of code lol
 AntiSquid: feels more pointless than sitting in the chat all day
 eulerscheZahl: CoC tells me that i'm at rank 750 now
 eulerscheZahl: can't click the top1000
 AntiSquid: me neither
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i have to wait till tomorrow
 AntiSquid: what is the last one?
 RoboStac: I didn't have to wait 
 eulerscheZahl: win 3 in a row
 eulerscheZahl: unfair RoboStac
 RoboStac: although I guess it may depend when they do the calculation check
 RoboStac: as I might have hit 1000 before that but got to the quest afterwards
 AntiSquid: admirable coc skills
 eulerscheZahl: i was in top10 or top20 at some point years ago
 eulerscheZahl: around 2000 earlier today
 eulerscheZahl: played 2 clashes, 750 now
 eulerscheZahl: can't unlock
 eulerscheZahl: the 2nd clash ended 35min ago
 RoboStac: I played loads yesterday to get the 50 played quest done - wasn't top 1000 before that
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just wait till tomorrow, not that urgent :P
 jacek: meh, when CG makes quests for clash then it is super. but when I invite people to clash i would get  banned ~
 eulerscheZahl: of course you would
 AntiSquid: who is banning you?
 jacek: there should be quest: invite a mod to clash
 eulerscheZahl: you seem to be the only moderator chatting at the moment, your turn
 eulerscheZahl: the risky track
 AntiSquid: i am ok with that, as long as i get a compensation for moral damages
 jacek: just as struct left with JS stuff
 eulerscheZahl: where is my struct?&#160;:(
 jacek: arkham asylum
 zCri: gamer
 eulerscheZahl: i'm hiring: JS slave wanted
 Marchete: struct eulerscheZahl { };
 Marchete: here it is
 eulerscheZahl: thank you for that qualified comment :D
 dbdr: I proposed the  "successfully invite eulerscheZahl to a clash" achievement
 Marchete: :rofl:
 JBM: i voted for
 dbdr: the hardest of all
 Marchete: I completely and totally agree
 eulerscheZahl: i opted out for invites
 dbdr: let's test it then&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: me too, that feature is so good and runs so smooth i forgot it even exists, but then i forgot invites exist
 dbdr: ah, you're not in the list
 Marchete: we can always ping you via chat, with a link to the CoC
 eulerscheZahl: i still get a lot of XXX is following you
 dbdr: now that I clash, I see why
 AntiSquid: just imagine it's a bunch of fangirls
 dbdr: the follow button is right there
 dbdr: though I'm not sure who appears in "online clashers" exactly
 eulerscheZahl: but how are players selected? random order?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: but still, who's at the top of the list?
 dbdr: \o/ shortest&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i hate golfing
 Marchete: are you guys playing CoC for real?
 dbdr: have to&#160;:)
 Marchete: btw temp is recalc'ed again...
 JBM: it's a new world
 eulerscheZahl: i played 2 for real
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tnzz3z">https://prnt.sc/tnzz3z</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and now i hope that i won 3 in a row at some point
 JBM: hey while we're talking crazy ideas
 JBM: they could have a leaderboard for "most public CoCs won in a row"
 eulerscheZahl: timezone dependent
 JBM: not so
 JBM: sleep schedule, if you insist
 JBM: if you're serious about it, you'll adjust
 eulerscheZahl: and i can create a new clash and start it instantly, playing 1 vs 1
 JBM: if your rival is serious he'll join before you can do that
 eulerscheZahl: and write a bot. you can win a few before you can captchas
 dbdr: I'm in a streak of 6 wins in a row&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: what are you missing for the clash path?
 dbdr: 50
 dbdr: I have 25 or so
 dbdr: doing golf before helped :D
 eulerscheZahl: definitely
 eulerscheZahl: except for fastest+reverse
 dbdr: are validators different than tests in coc?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: OK, I'll play it safe then&#160;:)
 dbdr: finished my streak&#160;:(2nd
 pedrosorio: lol
 eulerscheZahl: who was better than you?
 pedrosorio: kayou is really good at shortest it seems
 dbdr: yes, kayou
 dbdr: and a bit more experience with 1.2K clashes :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's more participations than clashes in the CG database
 kayou: yes, training helps&#160;;)
 dbdr: pigeon hole theorem
 eulerscheZahl: 681 clashes at the moment
 pedrosorio: what's the best way to see how many clashes I have done?
 eulerscheZahl: CoC leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global</a>
 pedrosorio: :thumbsup:
 pedrosorio: I don't love these shortest challenges
 dbdr: nice pedrosorio
 eulerscheZahl: you lost again dbdr?
 pedrosorio: the old in trick
 cmd.exe: 12142
 dbdr: yes, i'm bad at golf :D
 pedrosorio: I am guessing that's the 1 char difference between me and Nasos/dbdr
 AntiSquid: i forgot some contraction tricks&#160;:/
 dbdr: what's the in trick?
 pedrosorio: check my code
 pedrosorio: also, share yours
 dbdr: done
 pedrosorio: nvm
 pedrosorio: you use the in trick
 pedrosorio: and the for trick as well
 pedrosorio: which I did not lol
 dbdr: I=input&#160;?
 dbdr: I thought that saves nothing with 2 uses
 pedrosorio: it didn't save
 eulerscheZahl: ping wokan
 pedrosorio: I won because I did join on a generator instead of a list comprehension
 pedrosorio: 2 chars difference
 dbdr: oh, didn't know about generators
 dbdr: I'm not using python much
 AntiSquid: also print(x,"\n",y) doesn't seem to work as intended, was there a different way to do it?
 AntiSquid: py3
 AntiSquid: x and y being ints
 ifobg: hi, i have a problem with temperatures puzzle, request is Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 eulerscheZahl: try with sep="" AntiSquid
 ifobg: FailureFound: 5Expected: -5
 eulerscheZahl: but that's longer than 2 prints&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: are there +5 and -5 in the input or only -5?
 AntiSquid: print(x,"\n"+str(y)) ugh
 Laminator: is that really better than 2 print lines
 ifobg: in input are -5 and 5
 AntiSquid: this is about shortest mode
 AntiSquid: well hm ....
 ifobg: the content of the quest is wrong or i have bad program?
 Laminator: print(x)print(y)
 AntiSquid: doesn't look better :D
 Laminator: count em up lol
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; x=1; y=2&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"{x}\n{y}")12
 AntiSquid: but how do you shorten that?
 AntiSquid: there has to be a way
 eulerscheZahl: print(x,y,sep="\n")
 eulerscheZahl: getting even longer :rofl:
 Laminator: still longer though
 AntiSquid: ^ 19
 AntiSquid: double print is 16
 AntiSquid: print(f"{x}\n{y}") is 18&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: switch to ruby
 AntiSquid: i didn't use ruby for a very long time
 eulerscheZahl: p x should print x if i recall correctly
 AntiSquid: unbelievable how fast i forgot it, i practiced it for a good while too T_T
 eulerscheZahl: and MK can code anything in just 5 lines of ruby
 AntiSquid: all i remember is the gem stones
 eulerscheZahl: smash the code?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: ruby gems
 eulerscheZahl: UTG ore?
 Adassko: @Sofapuden: haha nice, same second
 AntiSquid: gems = libraries i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: die(x+"\n{y]")
 AntiSquid: Each gem has a name, version, and platform. For example, the rake gem has a 0.8.7 version (from May, 2009). Rake’s platform is ruby, which means it works on any platform Ruby runs on.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/">https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: {y]what weird syntax is that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: typo
 eulerscheZahl: i think someone wants to be pinged on discord without saying anything
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: dichotomy?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: o.0
 AntiSquid: i think your username should be considered spam
 AntiSquid: what do you think AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: how do you say that it's not a whole thing?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: ...
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized it isn't MostComplicatedUsername anymore
 AntiSquid: ya the whole thing is spam AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the replay in the contest?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: hahahaha :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what does everyone monitor on discord #general?
 Astrobytes: You Patrick :P
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i remember you having such a profile pic here on CG too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm an oldfart, no one stalks oldfarts.
 AntiSquid: could just use the words in your bio as nickname: CarbonBased, LifeForm
 eulerscheZahl: facebook hackercup started if anyone cares (i don't)
 Astrobytes: very similar to IAmAnAlienIThink
 pedrosorio: guys, join my clash
 AntiSquid: what are the challenges? i seen some facebook puzzles on leetcode they are like the medium ones on CG afaik
 eulerscheZahl: hackercup is like codejam
 eulerscheZahl: just that you need a facebook account and i hate that company
 AntiSquid: besides why does everyone want to work at Facebook Amazon Google? and i remember some even use an acronym for this to represent "quality jobs"
 AntiSquid: ah found it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp</a>
 AntiSquid: it's faang but never heard about someone dying to work for netflix
 Astrobytes: I always thought it was the "Big 4"
 Astrobytes: outside of stock markets
 PatrickMcGinnisII: didn't know FB had a hackercup
 JBM: it's reserved to FB users
 PatrickMcGinnisII: But I believe they know how to combine shards
 AntiSquid: did you know facebook had a digital currency PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;?
 AntiSquid: did you know China made their own digital currency because they are worried about the Libra and the like? Libra is the name of the FB currency
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the problems on FB look easy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl you gettin' that 20k?
 eulerscheZahl: 20k?
 pedrosorio: @AntiSquid "it's faang but never heard about someone dying to work for netflix"
 AntiSquid: it's such a low quality platform
 PatrickMcGinnisII: first-place prize to $20,000
 eulerscheZahl: tourist will get it
 AntiSquid: i understand amazon prime, i actually can find some decent shows on there at least, some times good ones
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh looks like it ranks by how long it took you to solve the problems, not how fast they execute
 JBM: as long as it's "fast enough"
 eulerscheZahl: that's the usual measurement in these contests
 AntiSquid: can you do it faster PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: see codejam, codeforces, codechef, ...
 AntiSquid: hackerank, leetcode, codesignal ...
 AntiSquid: someone shared a list with all of them
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know the last one
 AntiSquid: DollarAkshay 
 eulerscheZahl: i only refer to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/">https://clist.by/</a> when i want to know what's up next
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like you can drop in code you have probably already written for CG
 PkZ: Is "simulate the strategy" something else than just running the code or something?
 eulerscheZahl: in what context?
 eulerscheZahl: bot programming?
 PkZ: i guess so
 inoryy: &gt; besides why does everyone want to work at Facebook Amazon Google? 
 eulerscheZahl: you reimplement the game engine. then try some actions to score the outcome
 JBM: lack of morals
 PkZ: Im looking att eldidous strategy for Code vs Zombies and i cant really understand what he means by simulating a strategy
 inoryy: JBM in what way?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh crap, got work to do... I'm gonna ignore FB
 JBM: displacing democracy?
 eulerscheZahl: he reimplemented the game. tries some movements for Ash and sees what happens
 eulerscheZahl: then takes the best one
 inoryy: that's a bit of an extremist viewpoint
 eulerscheZahl: the art is to find a clever way to pick the possible actions
 JBM: it is
 eulerscheZahl: fully random won't do too well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fall challenge...91 days
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 eulerscheZahl: still a placeholder
 PkZ: can you explain "reimplemented the game"? because it sounds like he just used his own IDE or something
 AntiSquid: what do you think of Spoj eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: never really tried spoj
 JBM: fist player around
 JBM: it shows
 JBM: (inmultiple ways)
 eulerscheZahl: reimplement the game:you know in advance what outcome your actions will have
 eulerscheZahl: and then you try to get it as fast as possible to simulate thousands or even millions of actions and outcomes
 eulerscheZahl: and take the action giving the best result
 PkZ: So in that sense I would know how many zombies i've killed or something like that?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. everything
 PkZ: Hmm, i see
 PkZ: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: position of each zombie, humans alive, ...
 AntiSquid: inoryy is it extremist when it comes to facebook? some corporations are to be avoided at all costs
 inoryy: the question was about FAANG in general, no?
 AntiSquid: yes, then it deviated
 AntiSquid: derailed
 inoryy: but I responded to the initial quote?
 AntiSquid: yes, was referring to what JBM said
 eulerscheZahl: i'm distinguising more between these 5. facebook collects a lot of and given no benefit in return (when you are as anti-social as me)
 eulerscheZahl: google has a great search engine at least
 AntiSquid: but it's my personal bias against facebook, or maybe it's not really a bias? the guy is ready to lie with a straight face to congress about data privacy issues
 inoryy: anytway, even in case of FB I'm not sure whyscientists working at MILA in collaboration with FAIR should be held responsible for  questionable top level decisions made way above their head
 eulerscheZahl: but there's a new set of emojis!!!
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 inoryy: many novel research ideas came out of FAIR which contributed to the advancement of the field in general, even for the relatively tiny labs like my old uni
 eulerscheZahl: of course management makes the bad decisions. but they can't do the actual work on their own, everyone can decide to be part of it or not
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. i wouldn't work in a meat plant or for a tobacco company
 AntiSquid: i guess facebook isn't like monsanto or one of the oil giants, not polluting the environment
 inoryy: I get the sentiment but I'm not sure it's fair to just antagonize anyone working there with a single brush
 dbdr: polluting minds instead
 AntiSquid: did you feel antagonized? that wasn't the intent
 eulerscheZahl: everyone draws the line at a different point and there are obviously grey areas
 inoryy: well definitely by JBM's response
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't go as far as JBM with "lack of morals"
 AntiSquid: my first point was about people squeezing into the few big companies ... afterwards i guess JBM's comment awoke my anti-facebook sentiments
 Astrobytes: I hate everything equally, thereafter it's just a measure of how much. Works well :P
 AntiSquid: but euler, if your data is sold and someone makes money from it and you get nothing and you aren't even made aware about it, how does that make you feel?
 eulerscheZahl: pissed
 pedrosorio: @AntiSquid sold to whom?
 Astrobytes: Corporations in general are about making money no matter the cost.  They often invest highly in research, not everyone working for them is evil. That doesn't let the corporation off with their transgressions. And sure, in an ideal world everyone would be able to work in a place that matches their ethics etc, but not always possible.
 Astrobytes: Lots of people just want to innovate, push ahead in their field
 Astrobytes: Doesn't necessarily mean they're all corporate whores
 Astrobytes: And others just need a job.
 AntiSquid: i don't know the full details, but a good start is to google for&#160;: cambridge analytica if you want further details
 AntiSquid: pedrosorio
 Astrobytes: Yeah, check out the Guardian investigation, they blew the whole thing open with a few years of investigation
 pedrosorio: it seems like a strong opposition to facebook on the basis of them selling your personal data would require knowing the full details, no?
 Astrobytes: Definitely check it out pedrosorio
 Astrobytes: Bit of a rabbit hole so be prepared to read a lot
 pedrosorio: not about FB necessarily, but I find people tend to form strong opinions about topics from "general sentiment" that they picked up from news/friends talking as opposed to digging into the details and forming their own opinion
 Astrobytes: I always do the latter, and recommend others do the same
 AntiSquid: there's too much to talk about regarding those issues, in a normal world you would see more news coverage about that kind of topic
 AntiSquid: and the info is out there in public domain
 Astrobytes: Regarding Cambridge Analytica:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files">https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files</a>
 inoryy: to be clear I think what FB has done as a corporation is morally questionable at best, I'm just not sure I agree it's fair to put the blame on individual workers, especially considering majority have joined before the CA scandals
 Astrobytes: ^what I was getting at previously
 Astrobytes: Plus, workers are often not aware of what the upper echelons are actually using their work for
 Shroom2020: helllo
 JBM: oh my i kind of dropped a bombshell by accident here--and then went out to eat
 eulerscheZahl: you evil genius
 JBM: if only
 Astrobytes: :smiling_imp:
 JBM: great results, but lack of intent here
 JBM: "i'm an evil genius w/o even trying"
 JBM: i didn't even mean to say "people who work at faang lack moral fiber" directly
 JBM: i just offered "lack of moral" as a possible joke explanation for working there
 eulerscheZahl: and you have a bad timing for dinner, as you've proven before
 eulerscheZahl: eating during a 4h contest...
 JBM: missinh the ref there
 JBM: did i do that?
 JBM: i don't remember
 Astrobytes: Now, now JBM, you know that everything that is typed and sent must be interpreted literally and without humour
 eulerscheZahl: pikaptcha
 JBM: but i ranked like #22 at pikaptcha
 JBM: Astrobytes: yea hthat's the world we live in
 eulerscheZahl: It seems like I performed just a bit too casual to qualify for a T-shirt (eating, chatting on XMPP and going to the toilet—what was I thinking!) 
 JBM: so true
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/my-feeling-about-detective-pikaptcha/115488/18?u=eulerschezahl">https://forum.codingame.com/t/my-feeling-about-detective-pikaptcha/115488/18?u=eulerschezahl</a>
 JBM: not that i remember saying that
 JBM: but it's very me
 eulerscheZahl: holy wall of text, took me some scrolling just to get the link to share
 JBM: yeah
 JBM: nobody's really supposed to read those
 eulerscheZahl: i did
 JBM: crazy you
 Astrobytes: some of us do
 eulerscheZahl: and i agreed on most of it
 JBM: you might learn about people's feeling about a contest
 JBM: thta's Dangerous
 Astrobytes: Informed opinions!!! :o
 JBM: maybe I should edit an unusual english word in
 JBM: btw what WAS that word?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: orb
 JBM: oh
 JBM: that's my nethack past showing up
 eulerscheZahl: your English seems to be on a really high level. do you have any history of living in an English speaking country?
 JBM: i grew up in california
 eulerscheZahl: aaah
 JBM: not sure how english that's regarded in europe
 JBM: or gb
 Astrobytes: Ah I often wondered about your accent
 JBM: my accent is completely bonkers by now
 eulerscheZahl: you definitely don't sound french on your stream
 JBM: even i can't locate it anymore
 Astrobytes: Oh you still sound French to me
 JBM: oh that, sure
 Astrobytes: Just with a strange twang
 JBM: yeah, i feel like i'm uttering more and more french as time passes
 JBM: i hate it
 JBM: because i hear it
 eulerscheZahl: from colleagues?
 JBM: i was completely undistinguishable from my classmates at the time---apart from the fact i also spoke french
 JBM: most likely
 JBM: colleagues, and most anyone else
 JBM: i still live in france, even in the touristy place i live in most of the english is weird
 eulerscheZahl: bad question, let me try again:from fr people speaking fr or from them speaking en?
 JBM: from them speaking en
 JBM: well i mean
 JBM: i have no difficulty speaking the exact same en as them
 Astrobytes: Even when not sounding particularly French per se, you stress/accent certain syllables and whatnot rather French-y
 JBM: i just don't like the feel of it
 JBM: ouch
 JBM: do call me out when that happens
 JBM: i still intend to fix
 Astrobytes: Never!
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 JBM: heheh
 eulerscheZahl: i would be glad to be at your level&#160;;)
 JBM: you can get pretty far by just watching en-native series all day and being very self-conscious about your phonetics
 Astrobytes: euler your English is better than you give yourself credit for
 Astrobytes: Written at least, I only heard you talk once
 eulerscheZahl: written or spoken?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 JBM: my SO's english changed for the crazy best after she came to live zith me
 eulerscheZahl: written is fine
 JBM: just with accepting to watch shows w/o subs
 Astrobytes: Your spoken English seemed fine too 
 JBM: typically german
 JBM: but fine
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i'm stumbling over certain words
 Astrobytes: JBM immersion does work
 JBM: nothing like it
 eulerscheZahl: but good enough to express myself, that's the main point of a language for me
 JBM: it is
 Astrobytes: I was conversational in Greek after 9 months in Corfu, wasn't great but I could hold my own
 JBM: yay
 Astrobytes: 100% euler
 JBM: i heard thai was pretty easy to catch on
 eulerscheZahl: Shakespear and alike would disagree
 JBM: the shakespear
 JBM: +3 shaking dmg
 Astrobytes: Wobbles when you throw it
 Astrobytes: *vibrates
 eulerscheZahl: whoopsie :D
 Astrobytes: :P
 JBM: never get a typo go unpunned
 JBM: *let
 eulerscheZahl: i'll throw it at your troll
 JBM: be my guest!
 JBM: invite eZ to tvc
 Astrobytes: let JBM = ownedbyhisowntypo
 JBM: there oughtq be qn qchievement for thqt too
 JBM: ouch layouts
 JBM: y/q/a
 Astrobytes: Winning all the way here JBM
 JBM: on a streak
 Zenoscave: what's the difference in semantics between y and s in sed?
 JBM: completely different
 JBM: one is regex
 Zenoscave: other is char based?
 JBM: other is characters on a 1-to-1 basis
 Zenoscave: so `tr` equivalent?
 Zenoscave: or just one direction
 JBM: worse: s/// does a single replacement by default
 JBM: very tr-like
 Zenoscave: ah true
 JBM: tr/x/y/ is an alternate syntax
 Zenoscave: interesting
 Astrobytes: s is the regex one right? (years since I used that)
 JBM: yup
 Zenoscave: nice humble web chunk JBM
 JBM: XD
 JBM: more to come
 JBM: when i think of it
 Zenoscave: I can't wait
 Astrobytes: lol, said the same the other day
 JBM: truest fans
 Astrobytes: Fail
 Astrobytes: I mean Hail
 JBM: a common typo
 Zenoscave: I'd rather fail JBM&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Would be an accomplishment in my book
 Astrobytes: Not wrong
 Zenoscave: JBM why ranked so low? You seem to have a much higher handle on the CG rankings than is shown.
 JBM: it's all because of the great cp/xp schism
 Zenoscave: I see. Almost as bad as as the East-West Schism
 JBM: i just can't get myself to spend *that much* time coding on CG
 Zenoscave: How's your bot
 JBM: so i'm mostly fine with puzzles and the sort of thing where time spent &lt;-&gt; uncontested XP
 Astrobytes: ye, fix it
 Zenoscave: (Needed to fill a void of MK)
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 JBM: but fighting tooth and nail to keep CPs all year long...
 eulerscheZahl: let me teamviewer you
 Zenoscave: It stablizes in top 100.
 Astrobytes: beat me AGAIN damn you toad
 Zenoscave: lol eulerscheZahl I forgot that one
 eulerscheZahl: with 5 lines of ruby
 JBM: oh so maybe i should just reach top100
 Zenoscave: near the end it was down to 1
 JBM: i was top10 before their change O:-)
 Zenoscave: I vaguely remember&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: before they split CP/XP?
 Astrobytes: Claw back what is rightfully yours
 JBM: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and bob was #1 by XP
 JBM: post-split, yes, for a long time
 Zenoscave: I'm currently 2nd in Us in a few categories. Starting to loose momentum though
 JBM: you're bound to wonder whether it's worth it at some point
 Zenoscave: lose*
 Astrobytes: Did you get probcut working yet Zenoscave?
 Zenoscave: Haven't had time between work and classes to spend enough time with it
 Zenoscave: Now is my first stretch of more than an hour away from either
 eulerscheZahl: you are soon done with your studies, aren't you?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I didn't have as much time as I thought I would this week. Then somehow broke my runner and cba to fix it
 Astrobytes: Oof, long
 eulerscheZahl: zeno, not you Astrobytes
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl Sadly, no. Bueracracy took a bite out of my eta
 eulerscheZahl: you studied biology, I know that
 Astrobytes: Yeah I was talking to Zeno eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Zenoscave: So popular :D
 Zenoscave: A transfer credit from a smaller school didn't apply as paperwork took too long and the rules around it changed interim
 Astrobytes: ffs, some of my friends over the years had that issue. Some were actually delayed over a year
 eulerscheZahl: burocracy [sic!] can be a pain
 Zenoscave: I'm in year 7 of my B.Sc.
 Zenoscave: It's been nothing but a fight the whole time
 Astrobytes: *bureaucracy
 eulerscheZahl: got spammed with a lot of emails, missed that one telling be to register for my exams. after the deadline i got another one telling me that i missed it
 eulerscheZahl: had to go to the doctor, tell him that i was ill for 2 weeks and couldn't register
 Astrobytes: That's brutal Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: bring that notice to the university's office and pay 10€ to be able to take my exams
 Zenoscave: Here we do credit hours. I was 3 years and 90 CH into a 4year-120 CH degree and ended up needing to switch schools. To date they've accepted 15 Credits from that  
 eulerscheZahl: they want to keep you longer for tuition fees
 eulerscheZahl: wow, sounds like a long struggle
 Astrobytes: 15!!
 Zenoscave: Yup. And with the state of the world right now I doubt I'll finish. I don't have enough time to dedicate to online classes. But if I don't take them until Campus opens back, I'll have to re-enroll in the degree and probably tack on another 2-3 years
 eulerscheZahl: you'd be faster starting all over
 Astrobytes: I had issues with credit transfer as I moved around a bit but that is insane
 Zenoscave: They counted towards my total but none of the classes were accepted for credit towards requirements
 Zenoscave: I'll graduate with around 190-200 out of 120
 Astrobytes: Man that's a total disgrace if you ask me.
 Astrobytes: (the bureaucracy not your credits ofc)
 Zenoscave: The best part is the last degree major class I have is for incoming freshmen. I hold the record highest marks on the exit exam for the school
 Zenoscave: But i'm not allowed to test out or waive it
 Zenoscave: My score was in the 99.8% percentile nation wide
 Zenoscave: I acredit my time here on CG to many of the algorithm questions
 MSmits: it's good training
 Astrobytes: Ahh jeez. What a world. At least CG helped. And you know you'll ace it. But what a waste of resources.
 Zenoscave: And money. I'm not exactly well off financially
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I had the same issue.
 Astrobytes: Had to defer and go back to cheffing, then come back to it to pay for the rest.
 MOSTAFA: Hello Any one here worked on Rock paper Scissors 
 MOSTAFA: Puzzle 
 MOSTAFA: with c# 
 Astrobytes: *go back to cheffing to pay for the rest I mean
 MOSTAFA: I did all things but in the last test Last 5 rounds is working well 
 MOSTAFA: but first 5 Rounds is wrong 
 MOSTAFA: How that can be happen&#160;! 
 MSmits: i dont know the puzzle, but I would suggest you check how the test is different
 Astrobytes: I've not done that puzzle MOSTAFA, sorry
 Astrobytes: And perhaps use custom test cases if needed
 Laminator: anyone have any thoughts are pursuing PHD?
 MSmits: I thought about it in my field, but that was 16 yrs ago
 MOSTAFA: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i hate writing papers, so i quit after my master
 MOSTAFA: that is it 
 Astrobytes: I don't have one, but many of my friends do. It's a huge commitment and you really need to decide whether you can afford or actually want to dedicate yourself to it.
 MOSTAFA: unfortanetly it has not Hints and looks like few people solve it 
 MOSTAFA: I solved it except 50&#160;% of last test case 
 MSmits: ohhh lizard spock!
 MOSTAFA: i wonder how last 5 Rounds works Correctly 
 MOSTAFA: but first 5 Rounds is wrong 
 MOSTAFA: if there is bug in my code it should be vice versa
 MSmits: MOSTAFA what you need to do is to write debug statements so you can check all the steps of your program
 MSmits: you know your program, we dont
 MSmits: so if you cant guess whats wrong, it would be impossible for us to
 MSmits: so check the first round for example
 MSmits: see what the program does and check what it is supposed to do
 Laminator: I feel like if I'm discovering cool stuff, I'd want to share it with the world. So writing a paper for that purpose wouldn't be so bad
 Astrobytes: Depends what you want to achieve
 MSmits: the real sharing is not the paper though
 MSmits: that's scientific sharing, but usually not that many people actually read it
 MSmits: if you do something cool and write a blog/website or whatnot, thats where the real sharing is
 Astrobytes: PhD can be useful but not a requirement for a lot of jobs other than research positions (broadly speaking). And if you're going to go down the academic/research route you'll want to do something postdoc
 MSmits: thats why i didnt do a phd, no chance of doing a postdoc after
 Astrobytes: Wise choice
 MSmits: well, i could have done a postdoc, but I would have had to do it in Germany or England or something
 MSmits: I didnt want to go anywhere
 Astrobytes: Most people in academic research I know left very quickly
 Astrobytes: Other than one guy doing computational science and something to do with particles
 MSmits: I think my astrophysics institute is so prestigious that once you graduate, you can't stay because you're not good enough
 MSmits: half of them didn't speak Dutch
 Astrobytes: Ah I see
 MSmits: you can do a phd, but then they kick you out unless you're awesome
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's frequent across all disciplines
 Astrobytes: (at prestigious institutes I mean)
 MSmits: my mentor for my masters thesis said he would have taken me with him to England though
 MSmits: so that was nice to hear
 MSmits: but i like it here&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Thing is, a lot of science (excluding CS related stuff - I don't have the experience to comment) research is just ego- and money-driven
 MSmits: yeah i dont doubt that
 MSmits: dont they have a score for how many papers they churn out
 Astrobytes: End up slaving after some big-headed arsehole who wants to get published in x-journal and get more funding
 MSmits: not my thing
 MSmits: teaching is more fun imho and CS is more fun to me than physics
 Astrobytes: My ex worked in Antarctica for a season and couldn't believe the egos of the lead researchers. She was formerly a research assistant in the genomics division of the Immunology dept at a leading London institute
 MSmits: sounds like the plot of some horror movie
 Astrobytes: That was bad enough but Antarctica made her quit science, she's now an organic farmer
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: Strange you find computer-based stuff more interesting now than physics, what about back then?
 MSmits: I had very little idea about computer stuff back then
 MSmits: physics was just the easy way for me
 Astrobytes: That's fair enough
 MSmits: stick with what you know
 Astrobytes: Yeah absolutely
 Astrobytes: I learned a fair bit of stuff computing -wise through biology, but nothing like what I learned by myself (and through CG ofc)
 MSmits: I learned a little bit studying physics, but all my fellow students had a headstart somehow so I always felt like I sucked at it
 Astrobytes: And I did do a Java course, plus a mathematics for computer science &amp; data structures/algorithms course
 MSmits: I guess they coded before they started
 Astrobytes: Probably
 Astrobytes: The one thing I've learned over the years is it's never too late to change or catch up
 MSmits: coding is one of those things where it's very easy to turn away from it, if you're exposed to it in the wrong way
 Astrobytes: Very true
 MSmits: I try to be very careful of this in teaching. Many students quickly say they just cant do it, but coding seems a lot like magic, so it's even more so
 MSmits: like they do with math
 MSmits: math and coding are similar like that
 MSmits: physics too I guess, but math is worse
 Astrobytes: Yes, I can't disagree with that at all
 MSmits: one thing I try to do in physics when they say they cant do it, is show them stuff they did last year.
 MSmits: They thing all of that is easy
 MSmits: think
 MSmits: so how will you think of this next year?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, my chemistry teacher in 5th year did that
 MSmits: it works most of the time
 MSmits: though sometimes they dont even recognize stuff from last year
 MSmits: then you have a problem&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: We were mixed with the year above us, and he went straight to complicated organic stuff. My year just sat there not knowing a thing.
 MSmits: ah thats annoying
 Astrobytes: Then he told us we knew it. We just had to think a little bit.
 Astrobytes: Showed us what we were working on previously and sure enough, apply it? Job done
 Astrobytes: Just overwhelming sometimes. And you need the right students
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: sometimes it's just the speed of it, they cant keep up
 Astrobytes: Which (imo) is where education fails a bit (at least here). Wrong students for the wrong subjects/levels
 MSmits: in my country, when you dont pass the end of the year, you have to redo the year
 MSmits: the 2nd time it's always a breeze for them
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it used to be the same here, not sure how it is right now
 MSmits: Astrobytes it does fail, but that doesn't mean it's the fault of the system. It might not be possible to predict the development of the students. I actually did some research on this
 MSmits: turns out grades usually have almost no predictive value
 MSmits: except when they are very low, then you know they're not ready to move on
 MSmits: but a student with high grades in 1 year, might have low ones in the next year and vice versa, very little correlation
 MSmits: so it's hard to predict what level a student should be on
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, I don't mean grade-wise per se. It's more about teachers being able to tell who's really into what in the earlier years
 MSmits: ahh yes, that's important, but also pretty hard
 MSmits: the students themselves dont know
 Astrobytes: Kids get shoved in directions they shouldn't be shoved in you know
 Astrobytes: It's about capitalising on their skills
 MSmits: yes thats bad, but even with no shoving, its hard
 Astrobytes: I agree yes
 MSmits: for some students its completely clear
 MSmits: but some are mediocre in everything or extremely good at everything
 MSmits: if you talk about the choices they made a few yrs after they made them, it's very often silly reasons
 MSmits: a friend made the same choice, they didnt like a teacher etc.
 Astrobytes: Yup. And the other kids. The ones that aren't so academically minded (at least here) get left behind so badly
 MSmits: some do here, but not that many 
 MSmits: at worst they take an extra year to finish
 Astrobytes: Oh and yes MSmits, in fact I made some choices like that myself! And some friends took subjects because they fancied a girl etc
 MSmits: yeah that sort of thing
 Astrobytes: Kids here just get thrown away. They suck at x, y and z, go work in the sewers
 MSmits: what happens in the sewers?
 Astrobytes: Especially now with the lack of funding and low teaching pay
 Astrobytes: (just picking a job that requires less academic skill)
 MSmits: teaching pay is not bad here if you're acadamically trained. The problem is mostly that for each subject the teachers get the same salary
 MSmits: it's not that hard to find someone that teaches history or something
 Astrobytes: There were kids I knew at school that were expelled for being dyslexic, one of them now runs a building firm, that he built up from scratrch, because he was good at building
 MSmits: but try to find a CS teacher when you're competing with corporate salaries
 Astrobytes: Yeah, here it's a political issue
 Astrobytes: Not sure how it looks to the outside-UK world but most public systems are grossly underfunded. Preference to the private sector.
 MSmits: i don't think it's that bad here
 MSmits: left leaning countries do better in this way i think
 MSmits: scandinavia, western europe etc.
 Astrobytes: Yes. Sadly this country will never bend that way again by the looks of things. 
 MSmits: the UK political system is really really strange
 Astrobytes: We might have a chance in Scotland, support for independence is growing atm
 MSmits: stranger than the US system
 MSmits: you're 1/3 theocracy right?
 Astrobytes: It's just rigged to be in the interest of the wealthy.
 Astrobytes: Always has been. That's why it's never changed.
 MSmits: it's completely crazy that you dont have separation of church and state
 Astrobytes: They want the empire back, all that.
 MSmits: one of the most important foundations of democracy
 Astrobytes: Well... it's not *that* bad. America is way worse in that respect.
 MSmits: actually it isn't
 MSmits: it's written into the consititution
 MSmits: separation of church and state
 MSmits: though half of the population does not respect it
 MSmits: but at least it's written down
 Astrobytes: Yes. But everyone is fully aware that this is not the case
 MSmits: also
 MSmits: because there's clergy in the government
 MSmits: they're all MEN
 MSmits: so it's misogyny also
 Astrobytes: In our government?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: the clergy part
 MSmits: the reserved seats
 MSmits: they cant be women right?
 MSmits: or do i get that wrong?
 Astrobytes: They can I believe
 MSmits: ah then the anglican church is different than the catholic church in that respect
 Astrobytes: But our (I mean the English system that rules the UK) system is inherently misogynistic yes
 MSmits: hmm do you mean written down rules?
 Astrobytes: I believe there are still some archaic laws that prevent women from doing x, y, or z in certain political institutions/circumstances 
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: the weirdest thing to me is the fact that a country has a religion though
 Astrobytes: And here, we cling to our archaic system because it's what keeps the rich rich
 MSmits: we dont have a religion even though you can make a chart and have a religion with x&#160;% at the top
 Astrobytes: In Scotland we have a problem between Protestant (unionist) and Catholic, just like Ireland.
 MSmits: yeah that's weird to me
 MSmits: we have catholics and protestants also
 MSmits: but noone cares
 Astrobytes: It was down to the British when they tried to capture Ireland (simplification)
 MSmits: there's some fear of islam though, but that's true in many places
 Astrobytes: And there's a Dutch connection to the Protestant 'cause' of course: Willem Hendrik
 MSmits: to me it seems that the fact that you keep religion in your political system aggravates tensions like this
 MSmits: oh no doubt of that, we had issues in the past
 Astrobytes: It's not in the political system in Scotland. It's social more than anything.
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: but many are atheist aren't they?
 MSmits: or is that not the case in the UK?
 MSmits: I think it's nearly half here
 Astrobytes: Yep, now. But the toxic attitudes are passed down through generations, and so it will never end.
 MSmits: well with more atheism it will
 Astrobytes: At least here. Even Ireland is moving on better than here.
 MSmits: or do they consider themselves protestant atheists&#160;? :P
 MSmits: i would not actually be surprised
 Astrobytes: It doesn't even become about religion, it's just Huns vs Fenians
 Astrobytes: They don't get it
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: Rangers v Celtic
 Astrobytes: To use a football comparison
 MSmits: yeah tribalism
 Astrobytes: The schools here are segregated
 Astrobytes: (Scotland)
 MSmits: they officially are here too
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: 75% of them
 Astrobytes: Into protestant and catholic
 MSmits: but many of those 75% are not really religious
 MSmits: officially i work on a catholic school
 MSmits: at
 MSmits: but you almost never notice
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's funny that both schools have religions of all  type but you'll very rarely find a proddy in a catholic school, and vice versa
 MSmits: maybe in those 40-50 mins of christmas recital
 MSmits: oh, well you'll find all kinds in my school I think
 MSmits: I had to sign a paper that i respect the catholic tradition of my school, when i joined
 MSmits: that's fine with me
 Astrobytes: When I went to highschool I lost half my friends, cause they went to Catholic high school which was out of town
 MSmits: hmm I dont think my high school had a religion
 Astrobytes: Ours technically did not, but it wasn't catholic so the catholics wouldn't go to it
 MSmits: it was completely new too, when i went to it, it only existed for 1 year before
 Astrobytes: It's a ridiculous situation we have here, and it saddens me that we still have segregated schools. Sectarianism has no place in modern life imo.
 MSmits: my personal opinion is that religion is personal and belongs to families and extended families. It should be kept out of school except academically.
 Astrobytes: Totally agree.
 Astrobytes: Worthy of study but not of academic influence.
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: Anyway, on that note I am out for tonight
 Astrobytes: good chat MSmits
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: gn
 Cappefra: the quest map is a great idea
 Cappefra: also it gave me a level so thanks haha
 MSmits: yeah me too
 JBM: if it gave everybody a level, should the level requirements it sets be increased?
 MSmits: does it set level requirements?
 JBM: i think i saw a "reach level 30" somewhere
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: missed that
 JBM: you just clicked through :p
 MSmits: probably
 dbdr: *adjusted for level inflation

 AntiSquid: welcome to CG _Akira_ enjoy your stay
 sauusa: :robot:
 pedrosorio: what are the best/most fun games/contests/challenges in codingame?
 AntiSquid: damn i am exhausted, got too invested today into personal matters, my energy is spent, how was your day Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i already have all the information
 AntiSquid: you know everything about me Automaton2000&#160;? :o
 Automaton2000: who are you talking about
 AntiSquid: me? am i a nobody to you?&#160;:(
 oldrho: Automaton2000 do you like AntiSquid?
 Automaton2000: even if it is in a good way to start
 oldrho: That sounded positive enough
 TheSpiffiest: The things I learn on here are funny.  Convert a string to an arbitrary base.  Just found out Ruby  s.to_i(##) only works to base 36.  
 TheSpiffiest: thought I had such a 20 character solution. :P
 AntiSquid: pedrosorio obviously Botters of the Galaxy #1 by far and not because i helped making it, then there is Code of Kutulu, Vindinium and i also liked Legends of Code and magic to some extent (but with this last one i am biased since i like card games)
 AntiSquid: code 4 life is alright, i mean i liked splendor, smash the code is also decent
 pedrosorio: wow, that's enough to keep me busy until the end of the year, thanks AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: uhm just start the list with first few i mentioned and honestly keep an open mind to the other multis and even check out optimization section, because everyone has different preferences
 AntiSquid: you will see people nagging about various games, but they are only right when they tell you what they like, not what you like
 AntiSquid: i like A*Craft btw as an optimization puzzle
 pedrosorio: just to be clear, I wasn't being sarcastic, it's awesome there are so many interesting challenges
 AntiSquid: i was just saying you don't have to religiously stick to my list, except for Botters of the Galaxy duh
 inoryy: suggesting botg as a first multi? that's a bold move
 AntiSquid: see what i mean pedrosorio, this guy is going to tell you what he likes, watch out&#160;! listen to your own feelings
 AntiSquid: gn8
 pedrosorio: :D
 pedrosorio: inoryy what do you recommend?
 tomatoes: choose by popularity
 JBM: "not both" it seems
 JBM: Mmm in autocorrect land now
 JBM: * botg 
 inoryy: probably a controversial opinion but CSB is the easiest to get started, partially because it has built-in tutorials for the first few leages
 tomatoes: and, for example, im dont like (bad at) multiagent multis, maybe you're also like/dislike something
 pedrosorio: oh, just realized I was doing CSB, reached gold league, now I need to code a good bot 
 jrke: good morning 
 jrke: happy caturday

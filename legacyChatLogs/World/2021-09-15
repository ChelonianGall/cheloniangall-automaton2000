 ash15khng: i think scroll
 BlaiseEbuth: hold ctrl then scroll with the mouse's cursor over the code zone.
 ash15khng: lol scrolling just scrolls im dumb 
 magenta-sup: it's solved.Thank you

 ChickenHeq: lol
 TechTheAwesome: Huh so it wasn't me after all
 TechTheAwesome: thought since I'm like half the globe away from a EU server, its slow loading. But guess it was typescript...
 TechTheAwesome: Well in a way TS have to compile back down to JS before running &gt;~&lt;

 gugrbywitkr: hi
 Maxim251: I have quite stupid question, but I am thinking how write logic to choice best available hero.
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e1476e6f-3a1b-4eef-a9d1-024561cb7043">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e1476e6f-3a1b-4eef-a9d1-024561cb7043</a>
 Maxim251: Average of health and so on, is average added from each hero and divided from them all. I know that hero have higher points are better, but I am curious if range is more iportant or demage, how  logic can choice which one compare first.
 Maxim251: For example, Valkyrie is looking like good choice, if i will use average for demage, which is 67, VALKYRIE have 65 what makes this hero second from choice, Hulk is the best, but his range is very low, and average of all heroes is 170.
 Maxim251: where HULK have 95
 Maxim251: I know that the most important things in hero is health, damage, range. 
 Maxim251: If I use health - average.health I get this, and everything below 0 should be not concidered to use?
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b91065fd-879e-49f4-96f9-c6e27e183ba7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b91065fd-879e-49f4-96f9-c6e27e183ba7</a>
 Maxim251: I added also sum of all skills average all skills, then I get this
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ecec13a-0791-437d-876c-85016c1ccc2c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ecec13a-0791-437d-876c-85016c1ccc2c</a>
 Maxim251: Or I should use logic to find which hero is closest to 0&#160;?
 Maxim251: VALKYRIE ^199 -2 0 -40 Then this hero is best choice
 Maxim251: DEADPOOL ^179 13 0 -60
 Maxim251: DOCTOR_STRANGE ^-246 -17 0 75
 Maxim251: HULK ^249 13 0 -75
 Maxim251: IRONMAN ^-381 -7 0 100
 Maxim251: VALKYRIE ^199 -2 0 -40
 Maxim251: If is bigger then 0 then this asumtion is always good, mabe I should focused at the lowest skill
 Maxim251: DEADPOOL looks greate from that numbers, but range is -60
 Maxim251: VALKYRIE health looks greate, -2 from demage is not so bad, because is closest to 0, and range is the lowest from all heroes and it is -40
 Maxim251: IRONMAN health is terrible, have -381, and range will not help me keep that hero alive for longer time
 Maxim251: HULK is also greate because his health is the biggest, but range is the worst
 ProCoder03: Maxim251
 ProCoder03: instead of choosing it using bot..
 Uljahn: i guess there is no best hero, it all depends on how you counter your opponent's pick
 ProCoder03: just choose the HULK bcoz he is overall good.. 
 ProCoder03: for Wood leagues its more that enough..
 Uljahn: agreed
 Maxim251: But Valkyrie also looks good, Range is bigger yhen from hulk
 MiyamuraIzumi: which problem are you talking about?
 Uljahn: BotG
 Maxim251: Creating logic to automate hero choice
 ProCoder03: okay just choose valkyrie and play a match with the Boss 
 ProCoder03: All wood boss use HULK/DOCTOR STRANGE
 Maxim251:  Goal Oriented Action Planning
 ProCoder03: what for&#160;??
 Maxim251: It uses roles of make choices
 Maxim251: I was looking for something to calculate best choice using skills from heroes
 ProCoder03: That's a good idea but writing and wasting time for just passing half baked Wood 3 is not effective imho
 ProCoder03: *writing that complex piece of code
 dreadylein: eh, not sure if iam absolutly behind this idea, it does help to just code, even if it isnt the best use of time&#160;:)
 Maxim251: Yeah, but I want prepare code to be yeasy to add new propertys. I use now OOP, and I want create code, that in higher level will be easier to add functionality
 Maxim251: I am duing that not to get best score, but to practice good programing in C++
 Maxim251: Like, reusable code, fast and easy implementing new classes and so one. Thats why now I make my life more complicated
 Maxim251: because later it will pay me of yeasy adding new units, or new skills
 ProCoder03: well the problem is many thing will be different in Bronze compared to Wood 
 ProCoder03: well no to many but still there will be changes..
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/507a2759-cce2-4823-9ef5-b1a93736923b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/507a2759-cce2-4823-9ef5-b1a93736923b</a>
 Maxim251: I make sorting by hand using that average points, and iteresting is that range is in oposite direction to health
 ProCoder03: what are you measuring&#160;??
 ProCoder03: i mean what units..
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba10f56e-200c-4a5b-9b77-af8f93b2f304">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba10f56e-200c-4a5b-9b77-af8f93b2f304</a>
 Maxim251: data from game
 Maxim251: Botters of the Galaxy
 ProCoder03: all data's 
 ProCoder03:&#160;??
 Maxim251: no, that what I think are the most important for fight
 ProCoder03: Health, damage, and what&#160;??
 Maxim251: health, damage, range
 Maxim251: move speed is this same for them all,
 ProCoder03: Ohh....
 ProCoder03: Btw what is a seed in multiplayer&#160;??
 ProCoder03: in expert mode&#160;??
 Uljahn: seed for initial game state generator
 ProCoder03: Thanks 
 Uljahn: do you know what PRNG is?
 Maxim251: Seed is an extra number to randomise choice
 ProCoder03: nope..
 Uljahn: it's not an extra, it's the number which defines the state, the map configuration, entities placement, shop items etc.
 Maxim251: Yes, is based at system TIME, 
 ProCoder03: Ohhh.... 
 ProCoder03: Thanks both of you :smiley:
 Maxim251: This way whole map always is different 
 Uljahn: no
 Uljahn: map is defined by seed
 Maxim251: yes. and what is seed?
 Uljahn: seed is the starting point for PRNG
 ProCoder03: wait is PRNG psuedo random something&#160;??
 Uljahn: yep
 Uljahn: it's pseudo, so it's not really random
 Uljahn: if you know seed you can predict all the rest of PRNG
 ProCoder03: using system time to generate it right&#160;??
 Uljahn: no
 dreadylein: nope
 Maxim251: On PC if use function rnd() every time You start Your program, You get this same first number. To randomise that, You use a number like time which is always changing, never is this same. Day,hour,min, sec, this nomber multiplay by rand() function, and You get quite good randomisation
 dreadylein: there is some odd clipping of the seed going on but its not obviouse what exactly they are doing 
 ProCoder03: so the no. generated by rand() is psuedo random 
 Uljahn: you don't need real randomization in multis
 Maxim251: This way, when player is starting game from beggining, he never gets this same map .
 dreadylein: it is the java rng so depeding on the game you can figure out the state if you get enough rng ouput tho
 Uljahn: Maxim251: we are talking about CG multiplayers though
 ProCoder03: I just asked , was not going to predict the game or something..
 dreadylein: ah&#160;:) sorry missunderstood
 ProCoder03: np.
 Maxim251: I know, but I waqnt explain what is seed.
 Uljahn: you can set mode to manual to have the same seed every time, it's convinient when debugging
 Uljahn: *convenient
 ProCoder03: ohh. The random positions of bush/groots you get in BoTG is determined by seed if i understood rightly
 Uljahn: exactly
 Uljahn: also shop items
 ProCoder03: Okay got it... Thanks guys for explaining 
 Uljahn: in Last battles there is a feature to 'Send game parameters to IDE', which wouldn't be possible for truly random games, so it copies the seed and opponents to IDE
 ProCoder03: :open_mouth:
 Uljahn: for deterministic opponents the result of match would be the same
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8f765b1-416c-48c6-9846-d23bd57a8209">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8f765b1-416c-48c6-9846-d23bd57a8209</a>
 Maxim251: Oh, sometimes that pasteBin is innoying
 Maxim251: For sorting what type container is the best in C++?
 ProCoder03: Arrays as usual 
 Uljahn: why not priority_queue?
 MeBen: I wish clash chat tabs would close once the clash is over
 Uljahn: someone might ask you to share your solution tho
 Maxim251: I never use before queue, I will try
 ProCoder03: I have a doubt, Why is everyone using class in multis
 dreadylein: what do you mean&#160;? 
 ProCoder03: Well in all multis I just use conditions and I like have written class only for UTTT, But all others seem to use class and OOP heavily.. 
 Maxim251: and how use priority heap for class container?
 Maxim251: sorry, priority queue
 dreadylein: thats dependen on the language used, but for cpp, readability and best pratice mostly, the compiler will optimize them anyway most of the time
 ProCoder03: what abt C#&#160;??
 ProCoder03: :thinking:
 dreadylein: c# its not the best idea as its optimization pass is far weaker 
 dreadylein: but its perfectly fine to use them 95% of the time
 dreadylein: well lets say it this way, if you start not using things due to perfomance, you normaly at a point where you know why you dont use them hehe
 ProCoder03: wdym 
 ProCoder03: I don't understand your last text :confused:
 dreadylein: especialy in managed languages, you can get more perfomance if you understand what exactly happens under the hood
 ProCoder03: Ohhh!!
 dreadylein: mhh as example
 dreadylein: a managed language will do boundchecks on array access if it cant see directly the access will never get out of bounds
 dreadylein: so if you are able to arrange code in a way were this cant happen, you will save the cmps the compiler would otherwise put at this point
 ProCoder03: How can we do that
 ProCoder03: Is it by using an compiled language&#160;??
 dreadylein: native compiled languages wont deploy such checks , correct, they have their own quirks :P
 dreadylein: but realy, dont think toomuch about it
 dreadylein: if you absolutly want to squezz out more perfomancen
 dreadylein: check what bytecode or native code assembly looks like after compilation, change the code and check again
 ProCoder03: Thanks dreadylein 
 dreadylein: rule of thump, compares are slow, memory managemend is slow, less instruction is most of the time better then more, simple math is fast then complex math
 dreadylein: your welcome
 dreadylein: thats massivly oversimplifyed, but should give you a startingpoint if you feel like looking into it
 ProCoder03: +1
 1rre: x &amp; 1 == 0 is 20-30x faster than x&#160;% 2 == 0
 ProCoder03: :astonished:
 dreadylein: if you feel like it lookup how bitboard engines work
 dreadylein: one sec
 dreadylein: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page</a>
 dreadylein: this one is about chess and pretty neat to understand how such an engine works
 ProCoder03: yeah, wontonimo explained about it... 
 dreadylein: dont worry&#160;:) if you wrap around your head once, it will get easier 
 ProCoder03: Well he did explain it well and I understood it ..
 ProCoder03: but haven't tried it yet at a large scale

 nukhu: hello 
 Kernelito: yoooo guys
 MiyamuraIzumi: hello guys
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am gonna play FC2020, do you guys have any idea?
 struct: on fc2020 I used beam search
 struct: you can check post postmortems 
 MiyamuraIzumi: I don't know beam search though
 struct: its bfs with pruning
 struct: you keep the best N nodes then play from those
 struct: then repeat
 struct: until you reach depth D
 struct: So you have original state
 struct: you try all the moves and you get S states
 MiyamuraIzumi: I see, it seems that I have somethng new to learn to play FC2020
 struct: if the number of states is bigger than the beam width then you only keep the best N states
 struct: then for all those N you try all the moves and you will get S states again
 struct: and you repeat the same process 
 struct: Until you reach a certain depth
 MiyamuraIzumi: I somehow understand the concept of beam search
 MiyamuraIzumi: so this mean, I will use beam search for both my bot and oppoent
 struct: I ignore the opponent
 struct: but my bot is not that good
 MiyamuraIzumi: how about MCTS?
 RoshanAbdullah: hi
 MiyamuraIzumi: I don't see much about it on post-moterm
 RoshanAbdullah: anybody here
 RoshanAbdullah: to talk to me

 RoshanAbdullah: hi miyamuralzumi
 RoshanAbdullah: lkfa
 struct: MiyamuraIzumi i have tried mcts
 struct: havent*
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh, thanks
 Wontonimo: i haven't used beam here on CG for any multi or puzzle.  Actually, I can't remember ever implementing beam
 Wontonimo: This is a great video <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1H3jAAGlEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1H3jAAGlEA</a> that covers DFS, BFS, Beam and shows they are all very much the same with only the queue as the difference
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: DFS uses FILOBFS uses FIFOBEAM uses sorted with max size
 Wontonimo: np&#160;!
 MiyamuraIzumi: are you still with Tron&#160;?
 Uljahn: there's one simple game i'd recommend for learning beamsearch (tiny grid and branching factor, no opponents) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048</a>
 struct: also search racer
 struct: race*
 struct: might work
 struct: not sure if people use beam there though
 Wontonimo: nice suggestions
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh, thanks
 Wontonimo: i've not been serious about any multi for a while.  I am toying with Tron still MiyamuraIzumi
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 MiyamuraIzumi: you rank high in 2048, what algorithm did you use Wontonimo?
 MiyamuraIzumi: especially, I see u use Java
 struct: Wontonimo do you know if to calculate  voronoi
 struct: they use normal distance to cell
 struct: or they do path finding to it?
 the_coding.my_guy: is lit
 Wontonimo: for 2048 i have a heuristic (because i've played a lot) and in addition I do a DFS of 7
 Wontonimo: for voronoi, I use move driven floodfill&#160;:(
 struct: i meant for tron
 Westicles: the fun thing about 2048 is you can let it run until it gets stuck clearing a big tile, then solve offline and hardcode a small chunk to get you past it
 struct: If i need to check for the path to calculate the distance that the cell is for voronoi
 Wontonimo: yeah, for tron, because of the trails are walls, i use synchronous flood fill
 Wontonimo: I used Java in 2048 because I didn't feel like writing a simulator and instead just reused the ref code
 Wontonimo: with some optimizations as it was a little slow
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh, I see
 Wontonimo: pretty fast way of getting a simulator working for any published multi or opti
 Westicles: not just published apparently
 Wontonimo: wdym?

 Husoski: @Rato For pure command-line execution, just use &lt; redirection from a text file with the test case.  With Python, I find it easier to to set a global DEBUG variable and override the input() function to use input from a string (using io.StringIO).  You can do similar things in C, C++ and Java by passing a FILE*, istream&amp; or Scanner to the function/method that reads the test case input.
 BobTheBuilder888: i forgot to delete the //messages in the clash.. wasted characters..

 TimothyAlexisVass: So I can make more...
 TempleOS: I will try it
 TempleOS: br
 BobTheBuilder888: sure ive upvoted it
 Wontonimo: you can make more without it being approved
 BobTheBuilder888: im still wondering what the thrust level is for wood 3, its not 100, 80, 75, etc. 
 BobTheBuilder888: do we change the numbers so one is 75 x other is 80 y?
 Wontonimo: 100
 Wontonimo: go with 100
 Wontonimo: do you have angle in wood 3?
 BobTheBuilder888: "its not 100, 80, or 75" ive tested it multiple times and it doesnt work. I havent fiddled with the code aswell.
 Wontonimo: do you have angle?
 Wontonimo: what variables do you have?
 BobTheBuilder888: i have the starter one, variable inputs
 BobTheBuilder888: that is the only one
 BobTheBuilder888: and i dont have angle
 Wontonimo: what are they, i don't remember
 BobTheBuilder888: here is the code:
 Wontonimo: just the variables
 Wontonimo: plz
 BobTheBuilder888: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eeff35e5-fb27-45da-9eb7-4a49ace17421">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eeff35e5-fb27-45da-9eb7-4a49ace17421</a>
 BobTheBuilder888: thats whwere the variables are
 BobTheBuilder888: whree*
 BobTheBuilder888: where*
 Wontonimo: and have you clicked "test in arena"?
 BobTheBuilder888: doesnt let me yet, it did before but i guess it restarted itself&#160;:/
 BobTheBuilder888:&#160;: /
 Wontonimo: really.  send me the whole code with speed set to 100
 Wontonimo: you can paste it here
 BobTheBuilder888: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85f20b7a-87a9-43ad-b6d2-b51df986b999">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85f20b7a-87a9-43ad-b6d2-b51df986b999</a>
 Wontonimo: well you have a but
 Wontonimo: bug
 Wontonimo:     console.log(nextCheckpointX + '100' + nextCheckpointY + ' 100');
 Wontonimo: is wrong
 Wontonimo: this will print out your x coordinate,
 Wontonimo: then 100 concated with you y coordinate
 Wontonimo: then a speed of 100
 Wontonimo: what you want is
 Wontonimo: the output is supposed to bex y speed
 Wontonimo: and you were printingx100y speed
 BobTheBuilder888: so nothing for x?
 Wontonimo: what do you mean nothing for x?
 BobTheBuilder888: gimme a sec
 Wontonimo: the x and y is the location you are targeting
 blea_ch: how to debug?
 Wontonimo: the third output is the speed that you are applying
 Wontonimo: read the write up.  it tells you that the output is supposed to be the x, y, speed.  not x100y speed
 Wontonimo: what do you mean blea_ch&#160;?
 Wontonimo: do you want debug print lines?
 blea_ch: yes
 Wontonimo: what language?
 blea_ch: python
 BobTheBuilder888: thanks wontonimo
 Wontonimo: no problem!
 Wontonimo: python it isprint("something", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 blea_ch: thank you
 Wontonimo: and make sure you import sys
 BobTheBuilder888: now im just #1 every second
 Wontonimo: if you ever forget, you can use the circle arrow at the top right to get the default code which has a debug example
 Wontonimo: great Bob!
 BobTheBuilder888: ive now got angles, thanks.
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c97894ad-694b-4cda-a559-eef6597fffb9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c97894ad-694b-4cda-a559-eef6597fffb9</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ that's for you BobTheBuilder888
 BobTheBuilder888: thanks 
 Wontonimo: what are you working on blea_ch?
 <b>**BobTheBuilder888 hi, im bob, and im failing the me vs boss 2 :D</b>
 Wontonimo: how did the angle code do?  can you send me a replay?  it is the share button.  it opens a new window.  paste the link to that new window of a replay against the boss
 BobTheBuilder888: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com">https://www.codingame.com</a>
 BobTheBuilder888: didnt know it went back there

 BobTheBuilder888: ^^ my code
 BobTheBuilder888: because i dont have a replay, ill just say a dust storm goes over me, i lose, the end.
 BobTheBuilder888: wait, i realised something..
 Wontonimo: that isn't code, that is english
 Wontonimo: you have to turn the english i sent you earlier into working code
 Armangh: Hey guys i need some help as to why my code for the first algorithm exercise, the temperatures finding one, isn't working
 Wontonimo: sure
 Armangh: it works fine on my own IDE but its buggy on here
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah thats what im doing, thats what i realised.
 Wontonimo: i don't have that problem
 Wontonimo: tell me more Armangh, what exactly is your code having trouble with?
 Armangh: how do i send a link to my code? new year
 Armangh: here*
 Wontonimo: you can paste it here
 Wontonimo: only do this for these intro thihngs
 Wontonimo: anything more than starter code, we don't paste full working code here
 Armangh: okay okay
 Wontonimo: but temperatures is considered starter, so go ahead and paste
 Armangh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d8fa28f2-beb5-4526-8172-b1793ea4c004">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d8fa28f2-beb5-4526-8172-b1793ea4c004</a>
 Armangh: if you input 2 equal numbers but opposite signs, i.e. -5 and 5, it should output the positive one
 BobTheBuilder888: thrust isnt a variable, right?
 BobTheBuilder888: i should then find a new word for it..
 Wontonimo: you can make it a variable
 Wontonimo: it just code
 Wontonimo: you can do what you want
 BobTheBuilder888: how to make it act like thrust?
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 BobTheBuilder888: how to code it so it acts like thrust.
 Wontonimo: just a sec, i'm looking at Armangh's code
 Wontonimo: i see a problem.  you have 2 "}" after the first elseif
 Wontonimo: you have }}, when you should have just }
 Wontonimo: oh, no, never mind
 Wontonimo: still looking
 Armangh: i appreciate it
 BobTheBuilder888: console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' 100'); stays in the code, right?
 Wontonimo: found it
 Wontonimo: your loop should befor (int i = 0; i&lt;n; i++){
 Wontonimo: and you should not have the final line in the loop of "i++"
 Armangh: ohhh thats a leftover from when it was a do while 
 Wontonimo: since you already have the i++ in the "for (int i = 0; i&lt;n; i++){"
 Wontonimo: cheers
 Armangh: eyy it works
 Armangh: thanks a bunch
 BobTheBuilder888: how many  coding languages do you know
 Wontonimo: hey BobTheBuilder888, so you can make new variables however you like:
 BobTheBuilder888: oh ok
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61c19e2e-40c3-41bf-b91b-ee3f295e90f5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61c19e2e-40c3-41bf-b91b-ee3f295e90f5</a>
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah, ive done something close to that.
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52169c4a-e539-4e1a-b16b-70aabf9722c6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52169c4a-e539-4e1a-b16b-70aabf9722c6</a>
 BobTheBuilder888: smart idea, thanks.
 Wontonimo: i'm kinda between languages at the moment, but i can code for work in 3, python, java, typescript
 Wontonimo: brb
 Wontonimo: hey Armangh, have you tried any of the bot battles?  Like coders strikes back or connect 4&#160;?
 Armangh: oh no not yet, the temperatures one was my first 
 BobTheBuilder888:                 im trying to think of something meaning 'if'
 Wontonimo: may i recommend <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a> , but turn off your sound
 Armangh: sure i'll have a crack at it
 Armangh: thanks
 BobTheBuilder888: i might as well try it
 Wontonimo: cool cool
 BobTheBuilder888: nevermind it looks full of maths
 Wontonimo: it's not
 Wontonimo: if you read the problem description and realize you don't have to do any turning, just throttle the thrust, you can get through it with some if statements
 Wontonimo: but if you've already started on coders strikes back, keep at it
 BobTheBuilder888: ok well imma do more coders strike back
 BobTheBuilder888: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... BobTheBuilder888 will no longer be active in this game.
 BobTheBuilder888: do i use imput instead of some words?
 Wontonimo: yeah, you probably didn't provide output when expected
 BobTheBuilder888: input*
 BobTheBuilder888: oh ok
 BobTheBuilder888: im probably going to go for ten minutes
 BobTheBuilder888: brb
 BobTheBuilder888: im back
 BobTheBuilder888: im gonna go
 Wontonimo: later
 Wontonimo: i'm dropping off also
 Wontonimo: have a good night Armangh
 Wontonimo: one last hint before i go,if your vertical speed is less than -30, you'll want to use max trust 
 Armangh: gooodnight thanks a bunch for the help
 Armangh: hope to see you around more
 UmutTaskan: @AlecMan
 UmutTaskan: I am coming for you bro
 AlecMan: sounds good&#160;:)
 C26_1: Programs are just a bunch of inputs and outputs expectedly - Quote from Frames of Essence - 
 BobTheBuilder888: @UmutTaskan soooo, you live in canada
 BobTheBuilder888: in toronto?
 BobTheBuilder888: i will uno reverse card you, and track you down.
 ZaAinavolTrash: yo
 BobTheBuilder888: yes?
 ahik: hi
 BobTheBuilder888: hello
 ahik: how are you
 ahik: i know how to be 100% now
 BobTheBuilder888: im good
 Tonkaonka: where do I begin?
 BobTheBuilder888: if your new, like me, i would recommend starting on coders strike back, it is what i think the easiest one available
 FarrellMajorRex: hello
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b8220cde-13ac-4266-a075-576f690a65ea">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b8220cde-13ac-4266-a075-576f690a65ea</a>
 C26_1: @FarrellMajorRex hi\
 C26_1: My pastebin is my demo theory about base analysis
 BobTheBuilder888: thats alot of words
 C26_1: Actually I write it in Microsoft Word and the pastebin just make it worse
 C26_1: Sorry if you can't read the pastebn
 C26_1: pastebin*
 Wontonimo: fun fact, if your number system is base 52! then you will probably only ever need 1 digit.
 C26_1: hhahahah'
 C26_1: @Wontonimo
 C26_1: Sound so cheating
 Wontonimo: i just recently watched the youtube video about how ridiculously huge 52! is.
 BobTheBuilder888: why is  there a need for a&#160;!&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that means factorial.  4! = 4*3*2*1
 Wontonimo: 52! = 52*51*50*49...*3*2*1
 C26_1: Expanded Factorial using gamma function calculate, where x! = gamma(x+1)
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoeIllSxpEU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoeIllSxpEU</a>
 C26_1: x is a real number tho and You can check Gamma function in google
 BobTheBuilder888: ye
 Husoski: What's a googol in Base 52! then?
 Wontonimo: it can also be expressed as a sum
 C26_1: well if computers are powerful enough to calculate with big modular
 C26_1: 52! = 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000
 BobTheBuilder888: damn i accidentally left the clash chat before i said anything
 Husoski: Got it... 1 googol = (123979993085714859239503419889463) (75244126309708298933583249792920805436387260756800831488000000000000)
 Husoski: ...where () numbers are digits, base 52! 
 Wontonimo: 2 whole digits
 Husoski: More than 1, though...
 Wontonimo: i guess sometimes you've got to break out that second digit
 Wontonimo: it would take me more than an hour to count that high
 Wontonimo: even if i count by 2s
 Husoski: Since this count is shuffles of a pack of cards, maybe they should be "deckits"
 Wontonimo: i like it
 Wontonimo: everyone can have their own phone digit and ip digit using deckits
 Husoski: Someone said somewhere that there are about 10^80 protons in the observable universe, so that's another 2-deckit number.
 BobTheBuilder888: ok 
 BobTheBuilder888:    
 BobTheBuilder888: thats confusing
 Wontonimo: hey Husoski, are you working on CSB anymore?
 Husoski: Not lately.  Right now I'm finishing up the closest-pair problem buried in JBM's "Horse Hyperracing Hyperduels".   That and dinking around with Ruby a bit.
 Wontonimo: ah, you have to be able to process 100,000 horses within the time constraint
 Wontonimo: with a good algorithm, that is just under 2 million compares using a binary division of the problem.  if only i had the patience to code that. 
 Wontonimo: thanks for the hint about closest pairs.  i would have missed that
 Wontonimo: alright, i'm out again
 Wontonimo: bye

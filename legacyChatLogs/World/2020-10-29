 LeIT: start him
 LeIT: start game&#160;?
 HistoriCode97: Meh
 Trap-chan: good morning my little fellows :D
 WidePlayer: sup
 Aya_Noaman: hey
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: hi
 pascscha: Hello, BRETTRIVERBOAt
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi 
 pascscha: Hello, ToshiTuringMachine
 SydM107: Is there a quick way to somehow refresh the IDE? Sometimes it erroneously identifies errors and will no longer parse 
 ThunderbirdOne: submit the code and do a hard refresh on the page?
 AttilaStein: Are there any ressources on this site wehre you can learn about the concepts and syntax needed for a puzzle in a specific programming language?
 Light-Bringer: Hey I m new here I have a question, the input have to stay the same or can be change to manipulate them?
 Light-Bringer: Ex the Bank Robber puzzle the input for the Vaults is a integer but would be easy to just make it an object
 player_one: You can change the inputs. The system doesn't know anything about your code. Just what you output to stdout is important.
 Light-Bringer: okok
 Light-Bringer: thanks&#160;:)
 Light-Bringer: I m in C btw so no stdout for me
 Light-Bringer: :P
 player_one: Umm... C has stdout. look into the args to sprintf()
 player_one: printf() is to stdout by default.
 Light-Bringer: true
 Light-Bringer: it was light banter
 Light-Bringer:&#160;:
 Light-Bringer:&#160;:(
 player_one: sorry fprintf, not sprintf.
 player_one: typo.
 Light-Bringer: wait you dont even have to actually
 Light-Bringer: lel
 Light-Bringer: can we talk about the puzzles in here or not?
 Light-Bringer: not sure about the rules
 ThunderbirdOne: you can, i think it's just mostly frowed upon to give straight solutions
 Light-Bringer: fair&#160;:)
 pascscha: Are there solutions to old code-golf tasks? I cannot make my solution any shorter, yet there are some almost half its size in the same language on the leaderboard^^
 pascscha: I mean code golf tasks from the past that don't accept any new submissions
 jacek: clash?
 Sander-T: hi
 jacek: ohai
 player_one: What code golf tasks from the past don't accept solutions?
 player_one: ^don't accept new submission?
 Ola-Kitan: good
 Ola-Kitan: anyone on temperature?
 pascscha: I don't know if there are any that don't accept solutions, but I get the option to "Publish On Codingame", so I figured the published solutions must be available somewhere
 Astrobytes: They're not, that button does nothing. I think it's there for the Optimization games too.
 pascscha: Oh ok, is there any more general way to learn about the tricks these top submissions might use?
 Astrobytes: There are a few threads in the forum for language-specific golfing yeah. Also <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com">https://codegolf.stackexchange.com</a>, and there's a few other sites around with tips
 ThunderbirdOne: question, can i use the new ValueTuples in C# on CG&#160;?
 ThunderbirdOne: well... 'new'
 Aya_Noaman: guys I want to make a contribution but I don't know how to draw a grid map that looks like this if printed:
 Aya_Noaman: ####_####
 Aya_Noaman: ####__###
 Aya_Noaman: #####_##
 Aya_Noaman: something like this
 Aya_Noaman: help?
 Astrobytes: ThunderbirdOne: I think so, C# 8.0 (.NET Core Runtime 3.1.3)
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, it works
 ThunderbirdOne: for some reason i typed
 ThunderbirdOne: function (int x, int y) Name() { ... }
 ThunderbirdOne: no idea why i typed function and not just private static
 Astrobytes: lol, switching langs a lot recently?&#160;:)
 ThunderbirdOne: not at all actually :P
 Astrobytes: lol, no excuses then
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, no clue
 Aya_Noaman: hey anyone know an answer to my question up there
 Astrobytes: Aya_Noaman: Have patience, was getting a link for you.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/stub-generator-syntax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/stub-generator-syntax</a>

 Drakkhonian: test 3, wtf is that number of moves LOL
 Drakkhonian: test 4 and 5 too
 Drakkhonian: ok, time to think of a more efficient solution
 wlesavo: hey, are validators for CodinGame Sponsored Contest is the same as test cases or there is a difference? and if they are different then are they known? 
 la_sacree_gueule: hello everyone

 TripleBuses: boguette 
 Skynse: ngl captcha is annoying
 RohanasaurusRex: yeah but at least sometimes you just have to check the box
 RohanasaurusRex: but yea its still pretty annoying lol
 Skynse: The ones without images are fine
 Pawanel: help me 
 Pawanel: with descent 
 ThunderbirdOne: have you tried  asking nicely? using please etc?
 pascscha: Sorry, I'm asking about coding golf again. How are these insanely low coding golf byte counts even possible? For temperatures, some people managed to do it in 54 chars with Python3, that's how much I need to read in the data. These scores seem impossibly low to me.
 Uljahn: pascscha: what's your current score?
 pascscha: 98
 Uljahn: im at 68 in py3, no cheats just min() with lambda
 wlesavo: also reading of inputs could probably be done better
 pascscha: Ok, lambda shaved off my code to 78, thanks for that tip. The top of the leaderbaord still seems outlandishly short, I have a lot of respect for these guys.
 pascscha: Usually if you can't make it any shorter, the problem is that you should approach the problem from a completely different way. It might be that a given way of solving it is optimized as good as possible, with no shorter way of doing it, but with another approach many more characters can be shaved off. Thank you for your help, I am new to this community and you seem quite welcoming.
 Astrobytes: It's a great community&#160;:)
 Monstrux: Hey guys, I have a question.Im struggling with the Puzzle of the week: A Game of Go. i dont have the technical knowledge in javascript to find an easy way to organise the data(matrix of dots, Ws and Bs)

 AlPaca: is there a way to reset a language's default implementation that's presented when you open a problem for the first time?
 AlPaca: for a puzzle/problem, that is
 ZarthaxX: you have a reset button in the ide, top right
 AlPaca: ahhhh! great, thanks
 ZarthaxX: yw
 Th1nhNg0: nom nom nom
 eulerscheZahl: hey ZarthaxX lockdown is back in Germany too
 kovi: so can we expect another unofficial challenge, before the fall-official one?
 eulerscheZahl: the official one is in 2 weeks, so no
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested a game in August. CG seemed interested but said they won't do it before the Fall challenge
 eulerscheZahl: not decided if it will happen after or not at all
 eulerscheZahl: the topcoder marathon looks interesting
 IGNNE: Hey, I have a stupid question. I'm trying to go up the leagues in the "Coders Strike Back" game, but it somehow doesn't let me go to the next level
 eulerscheZahl: are you above the boss on the leaderboard?
 IGNNE: I'm beating the boss (and I'm #1 at the leaderboard&#160;;) )  but there's no continue button
 eulerscheZahl: did your submit reach 100% yet?
 IGNNE: How do I check? I'm pretty new, sorry if this is a noob question
 wlesavo: euler, do you know if maps for validators in CG sponsored contest are the same for validators?
 eulerscheZahl: nope, you are at 66%
 dbf: "not decided if it will happen after or not at all" - you have not decided, or CG team has not decided yet?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: wait until it finishes
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl yes i heard and thought of you when you told me it was coming :P
 eulerscheZahl: no wlesavo, ask dbdr about it
 ZarthaxX: im talking about lockdown
 IGNNE: Ah, thanks::thumbsup:
 wlesavo: thx will do
 eulerscheZahl: i'm waiting for the GO from CodinGame. they have to approve the game first
 eulerscheZahl: no more soccer and working 100% remotely again - but i'm still better off than you i think
 dbdr: wlesavo: honestly, I don't remember, I looked at Sponsored quite a long time ago
 dbdr: maybe someone else remembers?
 wlesavo: hm
 eulerscheZahl: Neumann said it's the same iirc
 eulerscheZahl: congrats IGNNE, you are promoted now
 wlesavo: oh thx
 dbdr: I think at the time it was possible to view validators replays, but now it's blocked?
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: which sucks
 dbdr: yeah, especially that it changes, creates unfairness
 dbdr: I know I didn't completely reverse that optim, I guess a few people have?
 dbdr: as in 100% deterministic prediction
 eulerscheZahl: schubc invested some time
 eulerscheZahl: generated 15k testcases and passes all of them
 dbdr: wow
 eulerscheZahl: as in: predicting the next step for AIs
 wlesavo: nice
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if he completely reversed the bonus score
 dbdr: ah, 15k steps? I thought games
 eulerscheZahl: turns
 wlesavo: is there supper pellets?
 eulerscheZahl: psst
 dbdr: I *think* the score is not that hard, but I might misremember
 dbdr: no spoilers
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know what the game is about
 dbdr: :D
 wlesavo: anyway, thx, i ll try to recreate maps now =)
 eulerscheZahl: you wanted to solve space maze before :P
 dbdr: you might be able to extract info from tests, and use an assertion, to see if it crashes during validation
 dbdr: to confirm
 kovi: 3-5k is fair score
 wlesavo: yeah, i gave it a couple of tries and failed misserably, so ill try again later :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: dbdr yeah, thas my plan
 eulerscheZahl: by bot has no prior knowledge about the maps
 eulerscheZahl: and realizes too late that there is no 2nd exit
 wlesavo: well yeah, it looks like 3-5k achievable without map knowledge, but i want a proper sim
 dbdr: mine does, it detects the map from the first steps
 dbdr: a few look almost the same
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not surprised that you added that knowledge
 dbdr: :angel:

 eulerscheZahl: if you play for the money
 wlesavo: 0 for first and second place, if you score lower you gonna owe money to the organisers :slight_smile:
 dbdr: geolocation based on sound; interesting!
 dbdr: wlesavo lol
 eulerscheZahl: in Soviet Russia you pay for the contest
 dbdr: I read a short story about a reverse lottery
 dbdr: instead of everyone paying a little, and one person winning a lot
 dbdr: everyone wins a little
 dbdr: every one person who is killed / made a slave, something like that
 dbdr: *except one person who is killed/enslaved
 dbdr: I think it's by Jorge Luis Borges
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl yes you will always be beter than here :D
 Majeck: I love Jorge Luis Borges' works
 Majeck: He's a really good writer
 ZarthaxX: we have people here occupying other's terrain
 eulerscheZahl: so someone stole your pool?
 ZarthaxX: and now the government as an incentive to stop them from doing this they will pay them 
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery_in_Babylon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery_in_Babylon</a>
 ZarthaxX: approximately 1600 dollars in 6 months
 ZarthaxX: so the deal right now is go occupy a terrain and you will get paid for that :D
 eulerscheZahl: Argentinian dollars?
 ZarthaxX: better salary than an actual job
 ZarthaxX: i converted it to dollars
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 ZarthaxX: its 300k pesos here
 ZarthaxX: we almost got a 200:1 conversion :D
 ZarthaxX: im talking about terrains like in the farm
 ZarthaxX: for now at least
 Majeck: Why does "if None:" in python register as True?
 Majeck: Not complaining, it allowed me to remove 2 chars in a code golf
 Majeck: Just want to know why
 dbdr: wow, c4l is seriously random
 dbdr: finished #45 in gold, resub and I'm #1, close to bose at 40%&#160;:)
 dbdr: *boss
 Illedan: That game is the definition of A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; A :P
 dbdr: yes? in what way?
 dbdr: I thought it was the randomness of samples
 dbdr: Illedan in gold, tsss&#160;;)
 Illedan: One of my early contests
 Illedan: I was young
 Illedan: And so very n00b
 dbdr: multi is still open
 Illedan: Not going to open that vound
 dbdr: :D
 Illedan: Working on my BS
 dbdr: you're #23, with some spam submit yo might promote
 dbdr: or maybe my bot is especially sensitive to samples
 Illedan: Let me check
 dbdr: I'm doing the "return undiagnosed samples" strat&#160;:)
 Illedan: Efficient one
 Illedan: Mine is just bruteforce, and a stupid one
 Illedan: HOLY, the code I wrote :scream:
 Illedan: Abandon shit
 dbdr: bruteforce N next turns?
 Illedan: There is no such thing as "next" in my bot
 Illedan: Current.
 dbdr: bruteforce depth 1?
 Illedan: Yup
 dbdr: how can that work??
 dbdr: you need sime planning...
 dbdr: *some
 Illedan: I have 106 IFs in this code -.- Who writes this shit
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Gabbek: Hello everyone&#160;:)
 dbdr: :DMeanMax was my first contest, and only heuristic one
 dbdr: but now I will be legend with heuristics in c4l
 Gabbek: dbdr I'm really curious what's your approach in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-of-the-realm">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-of-the-realm</a> . Would you like to talk about it a bit?
 dbdr: 50 ifs Illedan
 Illedan: Rookie numbers
 dbdr: it's the quality, not the quantity&#160;;)
 dbdr: Gabbek, it's been a while, let me check...
 dbdr: what do you do?
 Zenoscave: dbdr what's the return undiagnosed strat
 dbdr: e.g. if you have 4 xp + mols in each category, you can return a sample without knowing what it needs
 dbdr: since 4 is the max for rank 1
 Zenoscave: huh
 Zenoscave: good to know
 dbdr: Marchete mentions it in the forum
 Gabbek: dbdr I only use the next two tiles and some heurestics when it comes to placing my next tiles; couldn't manage more with python ( talking about coders of the realm here, to avoid confusion :D )
 ChastyXD: how to create private coding games??
 Illedan: Clash ChastyXD?
 Illedan: Bottom of the clash page
 ChastyXD: Great I have seen that
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a> =&gt; Start a private clash
 ChastyXD: Thank u so much
 dbdr: Gabbek, it looks like I'm doing a brute force search
 jacek: looks like? so you dont know?
 Gabbek: dbdr for how many tiles? 2/3/4 or more?&#160;:)
 dbdr: quick read of the code I wrote 6 months ago, or more?
 dbdr:         eprintln!("My next tiles: {:?}", tiles);
 dbdr: I don't remember the exact rules, we know more than that in advance?
 Gabbek: only in case of 1vs1 variant
 Gabbek: so about 30% of all matches
 dbdr: isn't that a separate game?
 eulerscheZahl: 125 if's in my code4life (including comments). did I win?
 dbdr: but that's a MC, no?
 eulerscheZahl: and why can't I use CTRL+Enter anymore to add a newline?
 ChastyXD: I have an idea
 Gabbek: nope, the separate game is 1vs1 with all tiles available, while here it's just half of the tiles in case of 1vs1
 eulerscheZahl: yes, monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: i mean SHIFT+ENTER
 eulerscheZahl: where is my newline?&#160;:(
 Gabbek: hello testing SHIFT+ENTERit worksnice
 Gabbek: seems to work eulerscheZahl
 dbdr: 
 dbdr: in chat?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: let me try in private mode
 dbdr: 123
 eulerscheZahl: 123
 eulerscheZahl: hm, some addon screwing up
 dbdr: polizei
 jacek: AutomatonNN will he succeed?
 AutomatonNN: why did you say that&#160;?
 dbdr: arf you messed up my joke :D
 Illedan: Give me that rank dbdr :D
 Illedan: Still a little too far
 Illedan: I see a bug
 Scarfield: grenadier
 Illedan: time to find the wrong IF
 dbdr: Illedan: I succesfully tricked you to lose your rank?
 eulerscheZahl: 12
 eulerscheZahl: ah, vimium it is
 Illedan: Lose?
 Illedan: I was 24th? :P
 Illedan: Now I ended 5th
 dbdr: oh
 dbdr: well
 eulerscheZahl: i miss vimperator :cry:
 Illedan: I changed a magic number though
 Gabbek: :D
 eulerscheZahl: the winrate number
 dbdr: vimium here
 dbdr: so you use vim mode in browser but not vim? original :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too lazy to click links with my mouse
 eulerscheZahl: but CG has poor support
 dbdr: what happens if someone submits after being marked for promotion?
 eulerscheZahl: the old chat allowed to switch chatrooms with vimium. the new doesn't
 dbdr: the submit ends suddently?
 Illedan: yes
 dbdr: Illedan, is your rank stable? you need to resub
 dbdr: you might promote
 dbdr: ah, will mise the train in 2 minutes
 dbdr: *miss
 Illedan: :scream:
 Illedan: Hold it!
 dbdr: Hoddor!
 dbdr: bing! :blush:
 dbdr: Gabbek, are you limited by speed?
 Gabbek: whoa, so many messages at once! Let me read quickly
 Gabbek: dbdr mostly in 1vs1 variant - but in the 4 players one I could use a bit of extra time for sure; that's why I've started learning some C#
 Gabbek: I was planning to incorporate remaining tiles pool somehow into my bot my after some quick tries I've gave up on it for now :D it sounds quite useful for sure
 Gabbek: but after*
 dbdr: Illedan, +0.05 :D
 eulerscheZahl: going for #1 globally, dbdr?
 dbdr: you won't let me&#160;;)
 JBM: fight!
 Gabbek: hehe, the best kind of fight :P
 dbdr: just taking my time, doing one multis when I feel like it, no rush
 dbdr: *old multis
 Gabbek: there's so many! I'm having issues on deciding which one I wanna start, hmm
 eulerscheZahl: it's up to royale if you are allowed to take a lead
 eulerscheZahl: he's playing onitama for several days already
 dbdr: you guys stay close for a long time now, no?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: Royale has weird swings, +1000 on some days
 eulerscheZahl: he's 1st when he doesn't resubmit at 4am
 dbdr: but I guess he has big minuses too, since he's not running away
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: 4am is a weird time to submit in europe
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it's 3am...you got the idea
 dbdr: Royale is a bot?
 Gabbek: eulerscheZahl I see yours <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>&#160;; scary success rate, how much harder it is compared to sokoban?&#160;:) Even the slightest comparison will be helpful, trying to plan out my weekend a bit :D
 jrke: hope royale plays dots and boxes as fast as possible&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: sokoban is a child's birthday
 dbdr: why jrke?
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Not enough&#160;:(
 Illedan: 0.16
 Illedan: -.-
 Gabbek: eulerscheZahl so that means it will take me a year or so, noted :D
 eulerscheZahl: sokoban can be done with BFS alone. space maze needs some heuristic on top, what to expand next
 jrke: cause my latest code in D&amp;B is pending i will finish it only when someone makes me push down in that
 dbdr: oh, you were at 90% when you were above
 dbdr: are you #1 jrke?
 dbdr: last time I checked it was crazyremi
 Gabbek: you guys are working hard&#160;:)
 jrke: nope i am not 1st i am 2nd
 dbdr: ah, above me then?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: by 0.01
 dbdr: lol
 Illedan: ezpz? :P
 jrke: till dbdr resubmit i am 2nd
 jrke: else 3rd cause someone pushed me above him by.01
 dbdr: done
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jrke: btw where is Ms research bot on D&amp;B? still painting rooms?
 jrke: lol i will be 3rd soon
 dbdr: lost to jacek&#160;:/
 Gabbek: off to read some stuff, have fun!
 dbdr: so many more people on d&amp;b
 jrke: i think i will go back to D&amp;B after fall challenge
 dbdr: we need a new league
 jrke: dbdr cause it became PotW once
 dbdr: that's good
 jrke: yup many CPs to me
 dbdr: Illedan beating me too
 dbdr: yay, 100% against CR :D
 dbdr: 50%
 jrke: 1/1 is not 100% you say dbdr&#160;;)
 dbdr: 1/1 is 100%, 1/2 is 50%
 jrke: in that case i am having 100% winrate against you 1/1&#160;;)
 jrke: sorry 3/3
 dbdr: yep
 dbdr: still 100%&#160;;)
 jrke: oke hoping good luck for furher resubmits (if you are going to do)i am off gn
 dbdr: gn
 starmaq: what challenge are you guys doing
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes</a>
 starmaq: thanks
 starmaq: wow
 starmaq: the amount of pressure that this generates
 Scarfield: Need some coffee? :p
 starmaq: sure hehe
 Scarfield: "Édouard Lucas, who called it "la pipopipette" which you will agree is a very pleasant name" Just started reading the statement xD
 dbdr: pressure?
 eulerscheZahl: peer pressureand next week he'll start smoking
 dbdr: - what are you doing?- A- hey, you're pressuring me into doing A!
 AleMalendra: test
 jacek: and im 6th just by being pushed by other people
 MSmits: hey guys
 Scarfield: oi
 MSmits: working on a traveling salesman thingy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/python/8a3db0ac8f?toggleCode=true">https://trinket.io/python/8a3db0ac8f?toggleCode=true</a>
 MSmits: t to make a new problem, r for random, i for best of 1000, h for hillclimbing
 jacek: thats just some dots
 MSmits: gonna add SA next and some code rewriting
 MSmits: yes, travelling salesman&#160;:)
 MSmits: try clicking r, i or h
 MSmits: pressing
 jacek: noice
 MSmits: hillclimbing is super effective for this problem apparently
 MSmits: except when N &gt; 30 
 MSmits: I guess that's when you need SA or something
 Scarfield: cool&#160;:)
 jacek: each dots visited only once?
 MSmits: thats the rule
 MSmits: and it's cyclic
 eulerscheZahl: there's a pretty good heuristic also: Christofides
 MSmits: so you end where you start
 jacek: lines overlapping looks like some dots are visited more than once
 MSmits: yeah i know jacek, it's not easy to eliminate that
 eulerscheZahl: proven do be at most 1.5x the best
 MSmits: thanks euler, will check out that heuristic
 MSmits: i did have a greedy heuristic
 MSmits: but it's bad
 jacek: Up until 2020, this was the best approximation ratio that has been proven for the traveling salesman problem
 jacek: maybe 2020 isnt bad after all
 MSmits: what happened in 2020
 eulerscheZahl: i need a full southpark season to understand that
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409">https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409</a>
 MSmits: ok that heuristic looks wayyyy too complicated for my class :P
 MSmits: but good to know it exists
 eulerscheZahl: no matching? :D
 MSmits: matching?
 eulerscheZahl: minimum-weight perfect matching
 MSmits: no idea what that is
 ZarthaxX: you are killing him :P
 MSmits: btw, my definition of a neigbor solution in this problem is just swapping the order of two dots
 MSmits: works wonders with hillclimbing
 MSmits: i can do this with SA too, but I have no idea how to GA this. How do you combine two solutions?
 eulerscheZahl: you can also take a chain of consecutive points and reverse the order
 MSmits: to make babies and stuf
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl ahh yeah
 eulerscheZahl: the removes some crossing lines
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: difficult to do this over the end of the array
 MSmits: messy i mean, to code
 ZarthaxX: combining solutions sounds weird
 MSmits: i mean
 eulerscheZahl: you mean lopping around while reversing?
 MSmits: procreation 
 ZarthaxX: incompatbility in the paths
 ZarthaxX: you mean crossover
 MSmits: yes eulerscheZahl
 Scarfield: for GA
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to. it's the same as reverting all other nodes
 MSmits: yeha crossover sorry
 ZarthaxX: im talking about ga yes
 MSmits: never done a GA
 ZarthaxX: it seems weird for this
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl ok, i should think about it more then
 Scarfield: yea
 MSmits: i will probably not do a GA then
 eulerscheZahl: you can split the path in 2 sections. it doesn't matter if you revert one or the other half
 ZarthaxX: SA is good too anyway
 MSmits: random / greedy / hillclimbing/ SA seems more than enough for a class
 ZarthaxX: yes
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl makes sense 
 ZarthaxX: there is smth called tabu search too
 MSmits: is it called tabu because people feel uncomfortable discussing it?
 ZarthaxX: it's interesting, but maybe too complex to implement, idk
 ZarthaxX: no lmao
 ZarthaxX: it tries to rmemeber explored solutions
 ZarthaxX: and other things
 ZarthaxX: to avoid looping over the same place agan
 ZarthaxX: again*
 MSmits: ahh i see
 ZarthaxX: but again, maybe out of scope
 Scarfield: i guess you could GA it. Have horisontal right as zero, then rotate around, sort the other unvisited points in order of apperance, have each gene represent the number chosen in the order, and so on
 MSmits: seems more something i should look at for an optim arena, not for a class
 MSmits: i know a lot more about adversarial algorithms used in arenas than that optim stuff
 ZarthaxX: yes, it may escape your class objectives
 MSmits: Scarfield the problem is mainly, crossover
 MSmits: if a gene is an order of points
 MSmits: how do you crossover?
 MSmits: mutating is easy
 jacek: ask your mum
 jacek: :v
 MSmits: lol
 Scarfield: wouldnt be a problem here: AAAA X BBBB -&gt; AABB and BBAA AAAA X BBBB -&gt; ABBB and BAAA
 rwilson: MSmits - did you consider varying the line colors to avoid the issue jacek mentioned?  .. like this maybe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/python/ce6626ae6c">https://trinket.io/python/ce6626ae6c</a>
 MSmits: damn
 MSmits: that's fast rwilson
 MSmits: you just looked at my code and changed that
 jacek: is he your student?
 MSmits: well done
 MSmits: i wish
 rwilson:&#160;;) good starting material = easy work
 MSmits: thanks  :)
 MSmits: something like this is better yeah
 MSmits: maybe I would change the colors less dramatically
 MSmits: but the idea is sound
 Scarfield: since the genes will just represent which unvisted point to go to from the current point
 rwilson: but.. it's a quick hack&#160;;)  even if it's only a couple lines, i'd do it a little nicer normally.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: Scarfield let me think about it a sec
 Scarfield: NO! :p
 MSmits: what is the A and the B?
 MSmits: my orders are more like this 0234576198
 MSmits: all unique indices
 MSmits: i swap them to generate neighbors
 IsThisWhereMyNameGoes: Aaaaave maríiiiiiia
 Scarfield: better example:1st 5th 2nd 1st X 3rd 4th 8th 2nd1st 5th 8th 2nd &amp; 3rd 4th 2nd 1st
 Scarfield: 1st will be the first dot from the current counter clockwise from vertical right for example
 Scarfield: and so on
 MSmits: hmm
 jacek: or be more modern and for traveling salesman problem use neural network, big data and blockchain
 MSmits: i'm getting to NNs as well jacek, just not that advanced :P
 MSmits: I want to maybe Q-learn hexapawn
 jacek: hexapawn is like mini breakthrough
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: Scarfield what if the solution is all over the place?
 MSmits: you can't have a clockwise or anti-clockwise situation then
 MSmits: i am a bit confused about what they do with the matchboxes in hexapawn. It's unplugged q-learning i think, but I don't understand how they choose between moving forward or taking an opponent piece
 MSmits: they use beads to select a pawn
 jacek: matchboxes? beads? w00t
 MSmits: yeah basically they use a bunch of matchboxes to create an ai
 Scarfield: how do you mean all over the place?
 MSmits: you play games repeatedly and every time it loses you remove the bead that made the losing move
 MSmits: so it learns
 MSmits: Scarfield lots of crossing lines
 MSmits: jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw7UAZNgGg8&amp;vl=no">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw7UAZNgGg8&amp;vl=no</a>
 MSmits: start at 2 min or so
 MSmits: skip introductory and advertising crap
 jacek: wtf
 Scarfield: i dont think that would be a problem, as you go through the genome, you check which dots havent been visited yet, and go to the specified number of the current gene. Im not saying it would work well, just thinking aloud that it can be done&#160;:)
 MSmits: ahh ok Scarfield, i might look at that as an extra assignment
 Scarfield: the issue is to represent the genes in a way that can be crossed over, ie not a series of unique indentifiers
 Scarfield: you would have to choose a starting point though for this approach to make any sense
 jacek: MSmits does he mean this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine</a>
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: but thats not what the video is about
 MSmits: thats just background info
 MSmits: Scarfield yeah thats what i thought, that my way of representing a gene is not helpful 
 MSmits: ohh i understand it now, the colors are actions, not pawns
 MSmits: so if a pawn can do 2 actions, both will have a bead
 MSmits: different colored bead I mean
 jacek: so this matchbox thing is q-table?
 ZarthaxX: that game concept is amazing 
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/v9mr7z">https://prnt.sc/v9mr7z</a> MSmits a super pretty illustration of what i mean
 jacek: its ugly
 Scarfield:&#160;:'(
 Scarfield: should have added a pony :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: yes you should
 MSmits: jacek yeah Q table mostly
 MSmits: seems to me
 MSmits: the guy speaks of genetic algorithm but thats misleading, it's definitely not GA
 MSmits: got it Scarfield&#160;:)
 MSmits: no ponies required
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/v9n0ds">https://prnt.sc/v9n0ds</a>
 Scarfield: fixed
 Scarfield: yea it has nothing to do with GA but the idea is cool!
 MSmits: i try to have at least 1 unplugged activity for every subject
 MSmits: TSP is easy, just let them find a good solution on paper and make a contest of it
 jacek: Scarfield twilight OP, nerf plx
 MSmits: oh right, i forgot jacek is a mlp expert
 MSmits: he made his own pony and called it derjak
 MSmits: dejack
 MSmits: cross those over for me Scarfield gettin tired of my typos
 Scarfield: glad you liked it :pwasnt there something about fans getting ponies added to the show?
 MSmits: ohh, jacek please tell me you participated
 ZarthaxX: TSP easy in what sense? 
 jacek: i believe some bronies were included as backgroung ponies in the show
 MSmits: easy to make material
 MSmits: just print it and let them puzzle it out
 MSmits: the matchbox thing seems really complicated
 ZarthaxX: ah 
 ZarthaxX: true
 MSmits: bronies?
 MSmits: bronies before honies?
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: gah how uneducated you are
 MSmits: I admit it
 jacek: and i see youre back to mcts in oware
 MSmits: ah yeah, i gave your algo a good try, it could get almost the same rank, but was still significantly weaker. I think I would need a stronger eval to make it work
 MSmits: the problem is that you could go 10 deep, with an inaccurate eval and completely overwrite the whole branch 
 KamalCh: Hi there
 MSmits: wheras ept is fuzzy and one bad eval wont mess things up too badly
 KamalCh: I'm new to this game
 MSmits: what game?
 KamalCh: Coding game
 jacek: :o
 MSmits: yeah but it's not one game
 MSmits: it's many games
 simon-tiger: Hi there! :wave:
 KamalCh: well it is sort of a big huge game with multiple little puzzles!
 MSmits: puzzles is one thing
 KamalCh: I'm actually stuck on the first one with the horses
 MSmits: is that the first one?
 jacek: dual races?
 jacek: horses? ponies?
 KamalCh: yeah
 MSmits: this one is yours jacek, obviously
 KamalCh: did a list with all horses
 KamalCh: but still something seems wrong in my code OO
 KamalCh: even tho I'm just comparing abs values in the lis
 simon-tiger: What is the puzzle you're doing?
 simon-tiger: Can you post a link?
 MSmits: which language KamalCh?
 KamalCh: Horse-racing Duals
 MSmits: i mean link the puzzle
 KamalCh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/horse-racing-duals">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/horse-racing-duals</a>
 MSmits: oh lol mine is in bash
 KamalCh: is alright I mean I did a list then "sort" the list
 MSmits: me too, thats what you're supposed to do
 KamalCh: then compared i and i+1 in the list
 KamalCh: and took the smalled value
 MSmits: thats exactly right
 KamalCh: but I believe something is wrong with my code -.-
 simon-tiger: Huh?
 jacek: you have error?
 MSmits: it's ok to link your code here, for an introductory puzzle like that
 MSmits: not ingeneral, but for this puzzle its ok
 MSmits: if you link it, we can fix it
 KamalCh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9aec37d-b6a8-4512-82cc-8ee1c3bbe07b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9aec37d-b6a8-4512-82cc-8ee1c3bbe07b</a>
 simon-tiger: It's ok to share code unless it's an ongoing contest
 simon-tiger: Ah...You forgot the i += 1
 MSmits: yeah
 KamalCh: NOOB
 KamalCh: -.-'
 MSmits: i never changes&#160;:)
 simon-tiger: Also, I would use a for loop, not a while loop
 MSmits: i would use for i in range(n-1)
 simon-tiger: yeah, that's what I would use
 MSmits: thats safer because the i++ happens automatically then
 jacek: and the elements of harmony
 MSmits: is this a ponly thing jacek?
 KamalCh: haha thanks so much
 MSmits: pony
 jacek: maybe
 MSmits: thought so
 MSmits: is this you jacek:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://metro.co.uk/2014/05/03/now-we-have-seen-everything-bronies-the-grown-men-obsessed-with-my-little-pony-4716666/">https://metro.co.uk/2014/05/03/now-we-have-seen-everything-bronies-the-grown-men-obsessed-with-my-little-pony-4716666/</a>
 KamalCh: that's me learning trying a while
 KamalCh: never again
 MSmits: whiles are useful
 MSmits: just not here
 jacek: G3 ponies? eww
 MSmits: is this a class of pony?
 MSmits: G3 is a stellar classification
 KamalCh: Lol wait what was that
 MSmits: KamalCh jacek is obsessed about ponies
 MSmits: so we need to discuss it every once in a while
 MSmits: otherwise he's gonna go to a CG alternative and we lose him
 KamalCh: that'S alright a pony a day keeps teh doctor away
 MSmits: you got it
 Scarfield: jacek is our little troll
 jacek: and new game has been approved
 Scarfield: there are MLP games?
 MSmits: blocking?
 MSmits: by tric trac?
 Scarfield: oh lol
 jacek: so far im 1st
 Scarfield: and last
 Scarfield: mwuhaha
 jacek: usual guys of board games
 Scarfield: seems like a cool game though, didnt see it in contributions
 MSmits: i'm not sure if i'll like this one
 MSmits: will be a long time before I try it I think
 MSmits: do you think it should go below paper soccer on my list jacek?
 MSmits: paper soccer is like 4th
 jacek: everything should be below paper soccer
 MSmits: problem is, games i am addicted to keep drawing me back in
 MSmits: like uttt
 darkhorse64: In this game ("penguins" is another example), you need to implement a n player algorithm. It cannot be a rehash of the usual MCTS code
 MSmits: smitsimax is my go to algorithm for &gt; 2p, but it doesnt work for sequential games. Only for simultaneous =/
 MSmits: well i suppose it would work for sequential somewhat, but the error it makes will be greater
 trictrac: you can use paranoid or max^n
 MSmits: biggest problem is that the allowed moves depend on opponent actions
 MSmits: yeah thats what i read before, like with tron, trictrac
 MSmits: congrats on acceptance of multi btw
 darkhorse64: There's also an mcts for n players
 MSmits: yeah, but is it any good?
 trictrac: thank you this is my first contribution, i will work now on hanabi
 MSmits: hanabi is a board game?
 trictrac: no cooperative game (like code a la mode)
 MSmits: interesting
 darkhorse64: You need to implement this flavor to know
 trictrac: 4 players --&gt; so 4 games of 3 players and sum for the score
 trictrac: the best you cooperate with others the best score you have
 MSmits: I see
 darkhorse64: trictrac: you failed to beat your boss
 MSmits: lol
 trictrac: the boss is a kind of max^n depth 2, I have a version time limited but I wait someone in bois 1 before launching this bot
 trictrac: for the moment, my bot is an oriented random
 darkhorse64: Hmm, I may need to add a few more ifs to my code then
 jacek: ifmax
 jacek: and im above worstfield
 dapOnEmHaters: HAHHAHAH
 dapOnEmHaters: i just did Thor
 dapOnEmHaters: Feel so good
 Skynse: How do you guys use the chat system lol?
 dapOnEmHaters: u type here
 Skynse: as in
 Skynse: the chat rooms get jumbled up in clashofcode
 Skynse: so Im not sure which one is the current coc chat
 somtingwong987: yeet
 GeorgeKrastev: Can I play 1v1 with a friend in a game other clash of code&#160;?
 SPDene: yes: scroll down to the bottom of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a> and "start a private clash", then give the link to your friend
 GeorgeKrastev: I meant other than clash of code
 ChastyXD: Hi
 ChastyXD: I want to test the live coding stream
 ChastyXD: I have a channel
 ChastyXD: I put there Codingame
 ChastyXD: but I'm not appearing at the streams page on Codingame
 ChastyXD: Do I need to do sth else
 Allis: Might be case-sensitive, such that it needs to be "CodinGame" exactly?
 Allis: If not that, then it might be the case that you need to be added to the list of streamers before showing up on the Live page.
 Allis: @ChastyXD In which case it might be best to ask for support in the Discord.
 ChastyXD: Hello Allis
 ChastyXD: I have tried that many times
 ChastyXD: but I dont appear there
 Allis: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

 Tsepeto: guyss
 Tsepeto: whaat is entityId in ghost in the cell?
 Tsepeto: i don't think it is explained
 rwilson: Tsepeto - it's just a unique # that refers to that 'THING' .  so on each turn you can know which thing WAS which thing last time, if you happen to care about that..     think of it kinda like a 'name' ..  Joe is at x,y this turn ...   next time Joe is at A,B 
 Tsepeto: we talking about factories
 Tsepeto: so if a factory has id 1 in one round
 Tsepeto: and another one has the same id the next one
 Tsepeto: we are talking about the same factory?
 CodingCarter: yep, because ids must be unique
 Tsepeto: i see, thanks boys
 Tsepeto: another question, for ghost in the cell which is not clear
 Tsepeto: so in the initialization input you get factory1, factory2 and the distance between them
 Tsepeto: factory# is the same as its id?
 Tsepeto: it's not explained in the problem
 DaNinja: thats right
 Jdools05: Hey, does anyone know any techniques to optimize looping through large datasets to speed up the code?
 rwilson: Jdools05 - for stuff on CodingGame? if so, that's mostly going to be by analysis, not so much about a particular techique per se.  ( example: looking for prime number from 1 to 10 billion -&gt; instead of testing each number for primeness, you KNOW you can skip at least every other, since they'd be divisible by 2 )
 Jdools05: yeah i should have made myself more clear, sorry. I'm stuck on Stock Exchange Losses. I have working code that I feel is short, but on the Large Dataset test case, it times out... I don't know what specifically to look for without looping through all the points
 rwilson: Jdools05 - for that one it's almost certainly how you're checking for the loss.  my tip for timeouts is to pick some key areas in your code to do some debug output of timing information - i.e. poor man's performance profiler..  just to make sure you're targeting the slow parts if you can't spot it clearly from the code alone.
 LastRick: jdools05: my guess is you are comparing each value in the index versus any other value in the index that comes later? That's so many checks for the large dataset. There is a smarter way to do it without have to check N vs N-1 so to speak
 Jdools05: Thanks, LastRick, I got it all figured out now! :thumbsup:
 Mr.Snow: hey guys im  new and stuck with temperatures puzzle, i know what to do but im not getting any progress on how to do, my code is returning wrong numbers, i hope you could show me a soloution so i can understand where im wrong. 
 Mr.Snow: its for c# 
 Mr.Snow: here's my code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/JxYrAhs.png">https://pasteboard.co/JxYrAhs.png</a>
 DaNinja: where are you checking which one is closer to zero?

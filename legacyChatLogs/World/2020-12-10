 bullettime: are you serious?
 bullettime: lol oh toppizza
 bullettime: go use google, here is not the place
 Phuc123456: helolo
 MadKnight: 17 states are with texas now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MadKnight watch NBC news instead.  TX can't sue another state for another states election laws.  All legal experts say it's just propaganda publicity junk.
 MadKnight: "another states election laws"&#160;?
 MadKnight: like they got a different law on that&#160;?
 MadKnight: but they're sueing them for doing election fraud
 MadKnight: does it even matter that it's a different state&#160;?
 MadKnight: in this case i mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f5e90bb-1969-4581-a82d-bb1f68e5b061">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f5e90bb-1969-4581-a82d-bb1f68e5b061</a>
 MadKnight: nonono they are sueing the states for taking away people's rights of having fair elections
 MadKnight: so the victim in this lawsuit are people
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You have to have a complaintant and it starts in the state of the problem.  it works its way up the ladder, not down. Texas as a public entity isn't a victim of Florida election laws ... they can file whatever they want... a judge will review it and throw it in the bin.  but in the meantime it made the news, spin/gossip bs.
 MadKnight: yea u want it to be some fancy masterplan
 MadKnight: where everything is just fake play
 PatrickMcGinnisII: We have so many unconstitutional laws on the books its ridiculous.  unless they get struck down in the state, they stay on the books ... and are perfectly legal ... and if they become illegal, they don't effect anything retroactively
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just the future
 MadKnight: like 77&#160;?
 MadKnight: let's go play the game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's a waste of everyone's time, just like us chatting about it...that's the point ... 
 MadKnight: yea but why do u think that was the main ide a?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: to punish the states that voted Biden under the guise of Dem. impartiality and unfair play.  Garbage.  They are just tying up the courts so legitimate things like suits preventing the rollout of a CoV vacc. don't get heard or delaying the white house changeover long enough to pass BS laws in Jan.
 MadKnight: what's BS laws&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if they can delay the changeover, congress will still be churning out Rep. bs laws while the country is distracted by the drama.  typical.
 MadKnight: but this drama creates real problems
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, maybe changing definitions of "Protest" into "Riot" and making it legal to define it as terrorism and punishable.
 MadKnight: if they would do it...
 MadKnight: your theory could be more realistic
 MadKnight: but they think it's actual protests and not riots
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Here find one...I'm sure there's a few BS bills in there:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, madone, the "Police state" fanatics want to have authority over everyone
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, there are 799 Bills in front of congress ... I guarantee some of them are against the wishes of the people... and the bs news distracts everyone from recognizing it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: here's a big one:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr6395/text">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr6395/text</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: read it carefully... if you read between the lines it says that the fed. can operate drones for "education" (*cough* surveillance) and that the US will use the defense act to industrialize production of the lectronics required to produce them.  Sounds like some KGB shit to me.&#160;;)
 slvt_c0d3r: :sleepy:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's so much sneaky sh*t going on ... smh.  How do they get away with it I wonder?  Oh yea, they blast news with BS
 vanya.delova: i need help
 vanya.delova: is there anyone here?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I must be on mute
 vanya.delova: i have a question
 vanya.delova: dunno who to ask
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what lang vanya.delova?  or is it CG in general?
 vanya.delova: JS
 vanya.delova: but all good
 vanya.delova: but only one very simple question
 vanya.delova: i wrote u a message
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't answer private msgs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what u want?
 vanya.delova: aaaa ok
 vanya.delova: u know the easy task about Thor?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sure
 vanya.delova: power of thor episode 1
 vanya.delova: why at the end we console log
 vanya.delova:  console.log(directionY + directionX);
 vanya.delova: and not  console.log(directionX + directionY);
 vanya.delova: why first Y
 vanya.delova: if I change position test dont pass
 vanya.delova: cant dig it
 vanya.delova: would u tell me?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: A single line providing the move to be made: N NE E SE S SW W ou NW
 vanya.delova: cant understand it
 vanya.delova: really
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cx=initialtx-lightx
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if cx!=0 then its east or west
 vanya.delova: what is cx?
 vanya.delova: sorry im junior&#160;:/ 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if cy!=0 then its N or S
 Uljahn: N/S is along y axis, W/E is along x, that's how you get y+x
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cx is just the change in position x, could be named anything
 vanya.delova: Oooooo i see
 vanya.delova: omg you re great, thank you everyone!
 MadKnight: PatrickMcGinnisII u wanna join TG channel and discuss this with other people&#160;?
 MadKnight: i got one of those
 vanya.delova: what is TG channel?
 MadKnight: telegram
 vanya.delova: im new&#160;:) 
 MadKnight: hi new
 MadKnight: it's not CG-related
 vanya.delova: ahhh :D
 MadKnight: we were discussing some politics
 vanya.delova: what is CG? :D
 MadKnight: CodinGame
 vanya.delova: ahhhh omg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah I'm going to bed soon
 MadKnight: A single line providing the move to be made: N NE E SE S SW W ou NW 
 MadKnight: what goes first - Y or X&#160;?
 MadKnight: "NE" - Y first or X&#160;?
 MadKnight: there's no such thing as EN
 MadKnight: which is X first
 vanya.delova: Oooo nowww I got it&#160;:) 
 vanya.delova: you know how to explain&#160;:) 
 MadKnight: absolutely
 MadKnight: (that's a local meme)
 MadKnight: (....reference)
 MadKnight: vanya.delova so are u doing puzzles for yourself or like for school&#160;?
 vanya.delova: to be honest a senior developr in my job (game development) told me to do couple of games so I can progress at work&#160;:) 
 vanya.delova: But I find it reallyyyyyy hard
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: then why are u doing tor
 MadKnight: lemme just give u
 MadKnight: a tutorial
 vanya.delova: thanks a lot&#160;:)
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-1/">http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-1/</a>
 vanya.delova: Much appreciated!&#160;:) 
 MadKnight: wait, what kind of games are u guys doing&#160;?
 MadKnight: vanya.delova
 VirtualAtom: m
 MadKnight: f
 MadKnight: and Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and need to find a good way to learn more about the game
 VirtualAtom: (sorry, pidgin getting keyboard focus -_-')
 Uljahn: btw "thor" and "the descent" are good for newbs because there is "hints" button on the left panel in these puzzles
 vanya.delova: Whaaaaa I didn't know
 MadKnight: but he wants to make games
 vanya.delova: where are they :D
 MadKnight: he needs more than "newbs" level
 vanya.delova: so at work is slot games at beggining
 vanya.delova: but now
 Uljahn: those hints are good to get started with CG platform
 vanya.delova: the senior collegue of mine decided to train us the news
 vanya.delova: and started to teach us MVC to implement in a pong game for learning purposes 
 vanya.delova: and it was hars
 vanya.delova: hard
 vanya.delova: also with OOP
 vanya.delova: so he told just to me to train in this platform codingame
 Uljahn: which language?
 vanya.delova: and every day he look at my solutions
 vanya.delova: so he asked me why we log first Y and then X 
 vanya.delova: and I couldnt answer
 vanya.delova: so he understood I didnt worte the solution myself
 vanya.delova: but found on internet
 vanya.delova:&#160;:(&#160;:(&#160;:(
 vanya.delova: shame on me!&#160;:/ 
 Uljahn: did he ask why the coordinate origin is in the top left corner? :smirk:
 vanya.delova: nope
 vanya.delova: I will ask him :D
 vanya.delova: and why?
 mzbear: Every location in the map needs to have some coordinates, or the location couldn't be referred to. The choice of a coordinate system doesn't matter, but it has already been decided for you, because the puzzle needs to point out some locations for you. Thus, you need to carefully read the problem description to understand how to make sense of the inputs, before you decide what to do with them.
 mzbear: Also, it's easier to make your own solution than it is to try to explain someone else's solution, so start from scratch and do it yourself
 mzbear: There's the "restore default code" button in the corner, hit it and get to work
 Assassin71: anyone there
 WaffleMan907: aye
 Assassin71: the temperature problem
 Assassin71: i cant get the no temperature test case working
 Assassin71: imusing  javascript
 Assassin71: ive tried falsy values
 Assassin71: checking length
 Assassin71: but none of those work
 WaffleMan907: rip i'm completely new to this site, I dont think i'll be much use lol, sorry my dude
 struct: Assassin71 just do if (numberOfTemperatures == 0) return 0
 Assassin71: if (n == 0) { 
 struct: if (n==0) consolo.log(0);
 Runner87: print
 Assassin71: ive tried print too
 VizGhar: try it again&#160;:)
 struct: put it right after var inputs = readline()
 struct: and do this
 struct: if(!n) {
 struct: A bit hacky
 Assassin71: Found: 0Expected: Nothing
 struct: put your code here please
 Assassin71: cant paste here
 struct: you can
 VizGhar: did you print 2 lines instead of one?
 Assassin71: this command does not exist  it says
 struct: do you have any / on your first line of the paste?
 struct: VizGhar I think it is the case
 Assassin71: yes
 struct: put a space behind it
 struct: and paste here
 Assassin71: struct
 Assassin71: i had one on before input case
 Assassin71: lol
 Assassin71: took me one hour to do this just last case
 Assassin71: thanks
 struct: np
 AntiSquid: my automatic reaction to no avatar chat conversations: SPAM ALERT!!!
 mzbear: struct should thicken those hexagons to make them stand out in the chat thumbnail too
 struct: I agree, its barely visible
 struct: looks like a plain white background
 Assassin71: aah
 Assassin71: its not handling the 5526 alone test case
 Assassin71: idk why
 struct: if (n == 1) console.log(inputs[0])
 Assassin71: i mean its handle the -single negative number case
 struct: maybe your lowest start at a lower number than 5526?
 struct: oh wait
 struct: Forget what I  said
 struct: or maybe not, it can be the cause
 MadKnight: hey guys let's watch terminator 5
 MadKnight: it's a pretty nice comedy movie
 mzbear: MadKnight, oh god. I checked a random clip of it from youtube and couldn't stand 10 seconds of it. I'd rather watch The Room again
 MadKnight: mzbear u are very lucky u haven't seen terminator 6
 MadKnight: especially
 MadKnight: the clip of that actress' play
 struct: How many terminators are there?
 MadKnight: 6 so far
 struct: I only watched the first 2
 mzbear: I didn't even know Terminator 4 existed until a few minutes ago
 Assassin71: if (n == 1) console.log(inputs[0])
 Assassin71: sadge
 MadKnight: but terminator 5 is like "terminator movie but if every single character was actually braindead
 MadKnight: |
 MadKnight: "
 MadKnight: and terminator 6 is like
 struct: Assassin71 what error does it give?
 MadKnight: "terminator movie but if the entire world physics was broken + actors were terrible"
 Assassin71: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c51482cc-01af-453d-b89a-bfa2ecda4183">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c51482cc-01af-453d-b89a-bfa2ecda4183</a>
 Assassin71: first 3 are red as in failed test
 MadKnight: fix it ezpz
 struct: Hmm I wonder why 1st fails
 MadKnight: nonoonono wait
 MadKnight: terminator 6 is like
 MadKnight: 6 is like 5, but worse
 MadKnight: terminator 6 made terminator 5 look good
 MadKnight: HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i can also do it
 MadKnight: IMPOSSIBLE, Automaton2000!
 Automaton2000: i have a new job
 mzbear: Terminator 7 - featuring Automaton2000 in all roles
 Automaton2000: best way to get around the track as fast as possible
 MadKnight: no mzbear, "terminator but every single character is brainded" is already T5
 MadKnight: u can't overdue T5 so easily
 mzbear: maybe we could replace the guys responsible for props, costumes and lighting with Automaton2000 as well?
 Automaton2000: you start at the same speed
 MadKnight: no that's the tiny details
 MadKnight: they don't matter
 mzbear: i'm sure the effect would snowball
 MadKnight: they already managed to find a way to overdo that
 MadKnight: u are still behind, mzbear
 MadKnight: u can't even imagine what they did to overcome your ideas in T6 mzbear
 MadKnight: they
 MadKnight: actually
 MadKnight: replaced
 MadKnight: JUMPS with graphics!
 MadKnight: now even the jumps are 3d rendered!
 MadKnight: the producer of T6 says - "we care about the team members so we do not endanger even those people who applied only to get endangered!"
 mzbear: oh god.  i just watched T6 trailer.  i had no words
 mzbear: i mean, i expected it to be bad
 MadKnight: BUT NOT SO MUCH TERRIBLY BAD right?
 mzbear: what the hell is wrong with the movie industry?
 MadKnight: the movie industry evolved to create content for this guy BadComedian who makes vids where he makes fun of movies 
 MadKnight: and does it really well
 mzbear: and the worst part ... is that these movies are still profitable.  everyone goes watch them because it's Terminator, even if it's super bad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Dune 2020 was suppossed to be release next week ... now they are pushing it back til oct next year....assh*les
 struct: mzbear thats why it happens
 struct: they dont have to put much effort
 MadKnight: actually T6 wasn't so profitable
 Uljahn: isn't h*llywood's main purpose a money laundering?
 MadKnight: no its main purpose is to show w*men
 MadKnight: in the industry
 MadKnight: and how strong the w*men are
 mzbear: ohh. the new Dune trailer looks okay. I haven't watched any movies in years, but I might want to see that one
 21stCenturyPeon:  T6 failed partly on its own merits (though I liked it), partly because of internet neckbeards getting all pissy about "women taking over", but mainly because the previous two films were so bad that they severely damaged the audience's trust in the franchise.
 AntiSquid: MadKnight why you ping me on discord?
 AntiSquid: triple ping&#160;!
 Uljahn: MadPing
 AntiSquid: TheMadPingerAgain
 PatrickMcGinnisII: JS inject a shell_exec
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it rhymes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh well, zzzzz
 vanya.delova: i need help
 MaxiLaw: Hello.
 YodaMaster123: What happened vanya.delova?
 Uljahn: that Rockstar555 is either quite stubborn or a part of a botnet :thinking:
 YodaMaster123: Botnet for sure...
 Rockstar555: hey why u saying this
 YodaMaster123: Another one?
 Rockstar555:  I am not i mistakly delete my account
 Uljahn: yep, evading the ban
 Rockstar555: so i change it
 YodaMaster123: But all the progress?
 Uljahn: all the c&amp;p work you mean
 YodaMaster123: C&amp;P? or just CP --&gt; Codin Points.
 Astrobytes: copy and paste
 jacek: CP2077?
 YodaMaster123: Why? Almost all of the fun in programming is the writing...
 Uljahn: that's how you can abuse mod powers
 Astrobytes: I'll never understand the mindset either
 YodaMaster123: We all complain about the pain of programming but we secretly love it&#160;;)
 LATEEF_2003: hi
 YodaMaster123: On a side note, anyone here followed the Magus document for a Search based algorithm in Fantastic Bits?
 LATEEF_2003: is there anyone living in paris?
 Astrobytes: yes Uljahn indeed. Approve puzzles with a note of "nicely used brain to constrate"
 Westicles:&#160;:)
 Westicles: I loved that one
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's definitely one of the better ones I've seen recently :D
 YodaMaster123: "nicely used brain to constrate". What in the world?
 YodaMaster123: Approve multiplayer games/
 Q12: &gt; YodaMaster123 I think that all the fun is in solving the problem. Then you get real pleasure, not just the writing.
 YodaMaster123: Yeah, ideating is amazing.
 Astrobytes: defo Q12
 milkias212: please work this
 Q12: what is 'defo'&#160;?
 YodaMaster123: Definitely...
 YodaMaster123: defo --&gt; definitely.
 Q12: ahhhh:sweat_smile:
 milkias212: body
 Astrobytes: ah sorry Q12&#160;:)
 YodaMaster123: Astro, did you work on Fantastic Bits?
 Astrobytes: Nothing other than some if's so far I'm afraid
 Astrobytes: think it's in silver
 YodaMaster123: Ah, ok... Any ideas about how to encode spells into a genome?
 YodaMaster123: My current one is a Genetic Algorithm with no spells at all.
 Astrobytes: I think you can get by with none or one spell iirc
 YodaMaster123: Get till Legend League?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Astrobytes: spells are just another action, so however you're doing it with movement, just do the same for spells
 YodaMaster123: Thats what I thought, use it exactly like Shield in Coders Strike Back.
 Astrobytes: yeah sure, exactly like that
 YodaMaster123: But I couldn't get past the Mana part. I wasted too much time simulating impossible moves.
 Astrobytes: well, you might wanna introduce some heuristics to prevent that&#160;;)
 YodaMaster123: Ah, only look at allowed spells. But to do that at each step during move generation?
 AntiSquid: YodaMaster123 i would say to not get too much involved with genetic algorithm part, just use random selection instead and then later convert to MCTS 
 YodaMaster123: A Tree Search? But Fantastic Bits branches too much.
 AntiSquid: it doesn't check all possibilities... like genetic algorithm doesn't check all .
 YodaMaster123: Understood, do the top guys all use a tree search?
 AntiSquid: some kind of search for sure, unless they have some complex integrals in their code :P
 YodaMaster123:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: go to forums and search feedback and strategies or search for the multiplayer name, there's a list of what people use
 YodaMaster123: Feedback and strategies is a goldmine! Thanks Squid&#160;:)
 Q12: I am working on Vox Codei - Episode 2 and I notice that the input of the grid is not match the visual grid.
 Q12: *doesn't
 Q12: Am I right?
 YodaMaster123: Not sure, message on the bugs channel on discord?
 Astrobytes: looks fine to me?
 Astrobytes: switch to debug mode and print 
 RoboStac: the only difference I can see is bombs aren't in the input, but you should know where they are as you placed them
 Astrobytes: It won't show bombs
 Astrobytes: yeah, what robo said
 Q12: That what I did Astrobytes
 Q12: Can I somehow share a replay of the game with my debug print so you would be able to see it?
 Astrobytes: Ah. OK, when you step through, the viewer shows the movement before you print the next grid. If you scroll down in the output, you should see the one that matches
 Q12: so the visual grid show me the next turn?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Q12: ok, weird, but thanks :slight_smile:
 YodaMaster123: Do you all usually work on the single player puzzles?
 Astrobytes: I do sometimes, I should catch up with some tbh
 YodaMaster123: Really? I haven't touched them or the clash of code, optimisation, and code golf...
 YodaMaster123: I find non AI ones boring :P
 mzbear: some of the puzzles are okay.  many of them are just annoying though, because they're not difficult and just tedious instead
 YodaMaster123: What are some of the good ones?
 Astrobytes: that's very subjective tbh 
 mzbear: code golf is completely useless due to narrow validation sets.  it would be interesting if any player could challenge the leaderboard with a custom test case of their own design, now THAT would make code golf meaningful again
 YodaMaster123: Yeah, its subjective... Just. wanted to know which ones you enjoyed.
 Westicles: YodaMaster123, there is a site with all the puzzle ratings.  Someone probably has the link
 YodaMaster123: Thanks _Westicles.
 darkhorse64: YodaMaster123: I'd go towards the official puzzles
 VizGhar: Hey guys. Thinking about MCTS. There are simulations required, which automatically means generating (pseudo)random moves... Are there any best practices for generating random numbers in bot programming?
 YodaMaster123: There is this fastrand thing. But beyond that its luck.
 YodaMaster123: Darkhorse, do you mean the ones by companies?
 mzbear: I cant even remember which puzzles I enjoyed tbh. If there was a way to list all my solutions to every puzzle, I could remember better which ones were fun and which ones weren't. But I don't keep local copies of my solutions...
 YodaMaster123: You don't need local copies unless you are RockStar555 :P
 VizGhar: YodaMaster123 thank you, I'll check that one
 struct: YodaMaster123 the ones made by CG
 YodaMaster123: NP VizGhar_
 VizGhar: YodaMaster123, do you really think RockStar has solved anything? :D
 YodaMaster123: Thanks _struct, are all of them from previous contests?
 YodaMaster123: Nope VizGhar_ :D They already told me...
 struct: Dont think so, but I wasnt around at that time
 Westicles: Nobody has the link to the puzzle rating?
 SAChamp: How to find out whether a problem exists in clash of code or not?
 mzbear: I suppose good visualizations are key to enjoyment of the solo puzzles.  being able to see what my code does without having to write my own debug output, there's something refreshing about that :D
 darkhorse64: I would also look at Detective Pikaptcha puzzles and also to the ones that require practicing BFS. A must have for many contests
 YodaMaster123: Thanks DarkHorse, so I'll look into the BFS ones.
 darkhorse64: The 11 puzzle is also noteworthy. Quite difficult but you'll learn something
 mzbear: The simpler "figure this out and print the answer" type of puzzles are only fun if they're short and compact, and many are just tedious
 mzbear: For example, I abandoned the Bender puzzle even though it's trivial
 Astrobytes: Westicles: this one?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html</a>
 Westicles: Astrobytes, yes thanks!
 Astrobytes: Ah cool. Sorry for delay, was afk.
 YodaMaster123: Thanks all&#160;:)
 Westicles: Hey look at that, Shikaku Solver #1
 Astrobytes: YodaMaster123: agree with darkhorse regarding official puzzles
 YodaMaster123: Will only look into the CodinGame puzzles.
 darkhorse64: Another good way to select a puzzle is to lurk on the chat. When people talk about a specific puzzle, it's probably worth looking at
 Astrobytes: There are good ones in the user contributions too, but do the official cg ones first
 Astrobytes: +1 for darkhorse's suggestion again
 mzbear: some people only talk about bad puzzles, though&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: that gives you a clue what to avoid&#160;;)
 mzbear: meanwhile, i dont know how many hours i've spent on Blocking and i'm still writing support code to manage the board and the shapes.  argh
 darkhorse64: If they are too simple, farm the XP. Otherwise, close the tab
 Astrobytes: Yeah, completing them all is not at all mandatory (though some enjoy trying)
 Westicles: If you want to do them all, you have to do the worst ones before they disappear.  To catch... what, Stilgart I guess has the most?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html</a>

 Westicles: I think he has done all the community puzzles, or very close
 Astrobytes: ah, forgot about that table. Nice
 eulerscheZahl: oh, he solved Space Maze now :othat was his nemesis for a long time
 eulerscheZahl: for a long time Bibou was at or close to 100% as well
 wlesavo: westicles should be easy top1 now for total solutions
 Westicles: Ha, I hoped before I get banned I have time to push the publish button&#160;:)
 Westicles: *hope
 Astrobytes: banned?
 eulerscheZahl: you won't get banned
 eulerscheZahl: just your moderation rights are in danger depending on how you use them
 Westicles: Oh, I was envisioning some future caper
 mzbear: westicles is just butthurt that his coding style combined with compiling and running a c++ solution via bash script was called "obfuscation"
 eulerscheZahl: i partially followed the discussion
 Westicles: That's a fair assessment
 Westicles: Well, and the snide "I appreciate your opinion", as Antisquid pointed out
 mzbear: i don't usually like to get into wars about brace styles, but placing a closing brace at the end of the last statement is atrocious :D
 Westicles: Er, is that aimed at something I did?
 mzbear: westicles, your solution code in the "a million digits of pi", where this conflict of yours apparently originated from
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57289ec74b1437929376813753dcee321467">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57289ec74b1437929376813753dcee321467</a> ... in case anyone else wants to know what i'm referring to
 Westicles: No, it started before that.
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5675bf9fab9a4d27753784fd901df125073f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5675bf9fab9a4d27753784fd901df125073f</a>
 mzbear: one space of indentation and unorthodox brace style definitely makes the code difficult to read for anyone who isn't used to reading a lot of code
 mzbear: i would've rejected the "abusing the system" puzzle too, since it's out of scope for what i believe the puzzles on this site are supposed to be about
 Westicles: No surprise there.  No offense, but you seem a little rigid
 mzbear: well, you're a "rules as they're enforced" guy while i'm a "rules as they're implied" guy
 Astrobytes: isn't the brace thing just a byproduct of the method used?
 Astrobytes: as in do the braces on separate lines mess it up
 Astrobytes: or was it just a space-saving thing?
 BouncySaxophoneOfDoom_673c: Hi&#160;!
 PeaceMoreZ: xd
 mzbear: astrobytes, i'm afraid that's his actual coding style.  i've known some mathematicians and physicists who write code in a similar manner
 Westicles: Sure, I never coded for a living, so I can call all my variables x and brace how I like.  Fight the power
 Uljahn: i find "abusing the system" puzzle quite enlightening, though it's hard to consider it as a puzzle, i guess it better fits tech.io playground
 Westicles: It will make a fine eternal WIP.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, both amused me tbh
 Westicles: Though I might need a ruling if rockstar gets back to level 20
 mzbear: It's definitely amusing, I won't deny that, and it highlights an issue with the code submission platform
 Astrobytes: we're keeping an eye on our rockstar friend
 mzbear: ideally, the solutions would run in a sandbox with no unnecessary binaries present, no permission to execve(), and no method of getting external entropy such as time information (except monotonic runtime, i suppose)
 Astrobytes: you don't code for a living either Westicles?
 Astrobytes: mzbear: it is what it is :shrug:
 Westicles: Nope, I was a HW guy
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 Astrobytes: am I the only one who doesn't work in a computing-related field?
 Uljahn: i work in publishing company :slight_smile:
 mzbear: well, i'm currently unemployed (hence i can waste time on this site), does that count? ;D
 Astrobytes: I thought you were in electrical engineering Uljahn?
 Uljahn: that's also true
 Astrobytes: lol mzbear, a fine way to waste time imo
 Uljahn: that doesn't seem like wasting for me, more like investing
 Astrobytes: true
 mzbear: the puzzles are kinda nice for having something small and constrained to work with.  personal projects always tend to grow out of whack somehow and never get finished
 Astrobytes: Keep them small and meaningful
 Astrobytes: Don't bite off more than you can chew at a time unless you have the mindset to follow it through to the end.
 mzbear: but everything always takes more time than estimated :D
 Astrobytes: Plan better&#160;;)
 mzbear: i remember when i was younger and at my first programming job, and some senior was telling that a programmer produces 8 lines of well documented and debugged code per day, on average. Took me forever to accept that it's even in the right ballpark, but damn, writing code is incredibly slow if you look at it over a longer span of time
 mzbear: i still constantly overestimate my coding speed
 Astrobytes: kinda projec/team-size dependant though. Personal stuff shouldn't take *quite* as long
 mzbear: yeah, the overhead only really starts to bite once there's more than 2 programmers in the project
 Westicles: 8 lines, with half being blank with just a brace.  
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/The_Brillant_Paula_Bean">https://thedailywtf.com/articles/The_Brillant_Paula_Bean</a>
 Westicles: EU vs. US work style I guess
 mzbear: westicles, indenting with two spaces instead of one is also preferrable in case you didn't do that yet, single space indents are a bit tight
 Westicles: It seems like a weird thing to care about
 mzbear: one space indents make it more difficult to see the structure at glance, and that's important
 mzbear: i personally prefer 2 space indents, although I'm using the 4 space indents at CG since the editor defaults to them
 Astrobytes: must... resist... tabs... spaces...
 Westicles: You guys are all thinking in terms of being a good worker bee and writing readable code for the guy in the next cubicle.  No need to do that here
 Q12: Astrobytes :joy:
 mzbear: also, i use One True Brace Style for my code usually, but i sometimes go for K&amp;R style if I feel it provides more clarity in the context
 mzbear: i'm writing readable code for the future me :D
 mzbear: any code, 3 months later i will look at it and curse at who was the idiot who wrote it, until git blame reveals it was me
 Westicles: I think you'll find any style works if you do it the same way every time.  If there is no need to share
 mzbear: almost any style, yes
 Astrobytes: Yes. Be consistent.
 reCurse: Yeah unless there's evidence of a style causing actual problems for which there is a fix no worse than the problem, there's no point arguing about coding style. The only point of coding style is to have a consistent codebase.
 reCurse: And I'm reaaaally sick of arguing about stuff like that at work -_-
 Nikkidutch: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7a6ad9b6-b802-4b81-9f96-ddf30b70bf20">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7a6ad9b6-b802-4b81-9f96-ddf30b70bf20</a>
 Nikkidutch: Whats this shit
 Nikkidutch: Works fine in my environment.
 mzbear: nikki, assert(line.length()==width); ... maybe?
 Nikkidutch: assert?
 mzbear: to make it crash if condition is false.  i'm guessing you aren't getting a full line
 Nikkidutch: this is c++ btw
 Nikkidutch: I asserted it but it seems fine
 Nikkidutch: It aint failing
 mzbear: can't remember that puzzle, but if you read integer before it, you might need to cin.ignore()
 Nikkidutch: Oh I already have that
 Nikkidutch: This thing is just bugged I think
 mzbear: are you sure the issue is in that code? throw something into cerr after reading each line and see what happens
 Nikkidutch: It says that I did not read all available input before printing an instruction... but that seems not the case
 Nikkidutch: standard error stream reads exactly everything
 mzbear: that warning is usually given if you print two lines of output instead of one, i.e. your output is desynced
 Nikkidutch: desynct
 Nikkidutch: great
 mzbear: if the turns keep progressing, most likely you're outputting multiple lines of output before reading new turn input
 RoboStac: there is no spoon has a bug where it displays that message for wrong answers as well as desyncs
 Nikkidutch: great
 RoboStac: just ignore the warning on that puzzle and it'll all work ok
 Nikkidutch: ok
 Nikkidutch: I passed the first testcase
 Nikkidutch: you are correct
 boaty: Hello Myfriend
 AntiSquid: hi
 mzbear: my Blocking bot ... 300 lines of code, and still no actual AI code ... but very soon i will be able to determine valid moves on my own
 mzbear: i suspect the leaderboard will be lonely, this is way too tedious to get started with
 darkhorse64: Yeah move gen looks quite involved. Maybe use the referee code as a reference 
 mzbear: referee code? what referee code?
 Astrobytes: there's a github repo linked in the description w/ the source code
 Astrobytes: (should be)
 darkhorse64: Sorry, I believed the game code was provided 
 Astrobytes: it isn't?
 mzbear: Not seeing such a thing
 Astrobytes: my apologies
 eulerscheZahl: i think he decided against a downloadable contribution to hide the boss code
 eulerscheZahl: and no github without the boss for who knows what reason
 Astrobytes: of all games I think this one could do with the github repo
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is a strong advocate of open source and always publishes the referee</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: maybe if you ask tric trac he might link the repo
 eulerscheZahl: in this case it's ok to ping: trictrac
 MaxiLaw: Hello.
 eulerscheZahl: not the user i wanted to summon
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Epic timing.
 LastRick: HAHHAH
 mzbear: personally, i think the command interface for Blocking is also unnecessarily complicated
 mzbear: for example, "0 0 C001" and "2 0 C003" are the exact same move, but the referee consider second one invalid because it requires the coordinates to be to a connected cell
 mzbear: ohwell.  i just hope i can get this done before this is no longer the puzzle of the week :D
 darkhorse64: Go ahead but please don't wreck my 90 line bot
 mzbear: Oh, I will definitely wreck it at the earliest opportunity! My slightly weighed rand() bot is doing reasonable well at middle of the leaderboard, too
 darkhorse64: I like GoTW on multis to collect free CPs
 i_suck_at_coding578375: i suck at coding r.i.p.
 darkhorse64: change your nickname. It will get better
 LastRick: ^
 LastRick: It's amazing what a few months on here will do for your programming skills.
 Nikkidutch: ^I thought so too. Just yesterday.. I am a professional programmer (embedded) for 3 years now. I am quite slow but I figure things out and fix them! Just now I was struggling with the There Is No Spoon Puzzle.. I found that the std::endl was wrong.. up until then I thought I sucked as well with this puzzle.. I will probably think I'll suck at the next and the next.. you don't suck.. Once a problem solver, always a problem solver.
 [CG]Thibaud: :heart:
 mzbear: looking at other people's solutions to puzzles is always so much fun, too.  i just wish i could view every published solution from the same person through their profile or something
 Astrobytes: Wise words.
 Astrobytes: mzbear: if you're particularly interested you could message them privately and ask
 Astrobytes: oh wait, I misread that
 mzbear: i mean, i could just click through every puzzle and go view the solutions one by one, so that info is available there .... just not centralized
 Astrobytes: Could be a useful feature I guess. "View all published solutions" button or something
 LastRick: My testimonial (and I'll date myself): I have been programming for literal decades. But I came here because I wanted to learn Dart (for Flutter). The side effects though, in just a few months, my code has gotten so much better, my class structures, BFS/DFS algorithms, etc, all improved. But I have learned so much about AI, GA, bots I would have never seen staring at spreadsheets all day.
 mzbear: every now and then i've ran into a real gem in the published solutions, and i would've preferred to see more code from that guy...
 [CG]Maxime: Hi!
 Gianggg: hi
 LastRick: hii
 Gh0stza: hi
 Astrobytes: A wild Maxime appears...
 [CG]Maxime: ahah :D
 [CG]Maxime: just doing a test with my friend [CG]BOUGA
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 [CG]Maxime: how are you Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: I'm good thanks, and you?
 [CG]Maxime: I'm fine
 eulerscheZahl: oh no. now LastRick writes "hii" as well
 Astrobytes: hah
 LastRick: Did i do it wrong?&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: yes h needs to be capitalized
 LastRick: hahah
 Astrobytes: lol
 darkhorse64: hihihi
 darkhorse64: I am the Walrus
 Astrobytes: hi hi hi was Wings no?
 darkhorse64: hi, the french way
 Astrobytes: ah
 Astrobytes: well, still a nice McCartney connection anyway
 Astrobytes: (for the record: I can't stand either)
 NguyenVinhHien: how to get optimization bros?
 NguyenVinhHien: what should i practice?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl?
 darkhorse64: For me, the Beatles are a great demonstration that the total is greater than the sum of parts
 Astrobytes: A valid point.
 LastRick: Yes. But Paul is still pretty damn good on his own.
 darkhorse64: The fact that he is still alive helps a lot
 Astrobytes: Talented, yes. Enormously. Just not to my taste.
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 LastRick: Yep. completely different stuff vs the Beatles. But both can be good.
 LastRick: Mark Knopfler is a great example of this too. Dire Straits was fantastic, but so is his solo stuff and its completely different.
 Astrobytes: I find him a tad boring at times but I *love* his playing
 LastRick: Fair enough.
 Astrobytes: Not boring... samey?
 Astrobytes: I don't dislike him in the slightest however. And Straits were fantastic.
 LastRick: yeah, at the end of the day, most of these albums are the same country/folk/blues sound
 Astrobytes: Hey, I like the Grateful Dead :P
 Astrobytes: (pre-1980s)
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr?
 dbdr: what is this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/515017710">https://www.codingame.com/replay/515017710</a>
 LastRick: bam!
 eulerscheZahl: you won
 Astrobytes: ^
 dbdr: seems oddly short
 dbdr: just walk straight to the shrine :D
 eulerscheZahl: the walk of fame
 dbdr: :nerd:
 LastRick: thats how winners walk
 eulerscheZahl: there must be a reason why you rank above me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/profile/eulerscheZahl">https://russianaicup.ru/profile/eulerscheZahl</a>I have a feeling that my new version might not be as good as i thought
 dbdr: sure, it's just I haven't seen any such short match
 dbdr: esp in top 20
 dbdr: so I wonder if you have a bug
 dbdr: or it's the combo of cards
 eulerscheZahl: try it offline vs yourself
 dbdr: how is your new version different?
 dbdr: oh, this could be a forced win...
 eulerscheZahl: changed both harvesting and fighting
 Astrobytes: I seem to have plateaued around 230-250th, haven't uploaded today yet
 eulerscheZahl: looking at my own score from the message i print, i just see quite late that i'm in danger
 dbdr: no, I see the win at frame 4
 eulerscheZahl: that's where i see the loss
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: well, frame 5 then
 dbdr: your second move must be bad
 dbdr: deep search does not find a win for my first state
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, just my bot being dumb, nothing to see here :D
 dbdr: #fixit
 jacek: :unamused:
 dbdr: sad to be #1?
 jacek: youre still messing with the tops
 dbdr: top 2 is a tie
 jacek: because I let him
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: and someone's spamming breakthrough too and managed to win 2 games with meh
 dbdr: you're meh? :D
 jacek: mee
 123456789LL: Hi
 jacek: ohai
 123456789LL: im new and I’m on the thor
 123456789LL: i don’t understand well I understand some stuff but not all of it
 Uljahn: click hints on the left
 123456789LL: I did 
 LastRick: any specific question you have?
 123456789LL: Yes uhh which code Is the easiest 
 jacek: thats weird question :o
 123456789LL: The like vb.net
 Leirn: The one you know&#160;?
 123456789LL: i don’t really know it but i use it
 Leirn: If you use it you may know it to some point at least
 123456789LL: yea i know it a little but not a lot is what I’m saying 
 Leirn: The question is&#160;: do you want to know it better, or do you want to learn a new one from scratch&#160;?
 123456789LL: know it better
 123456789LL: Hello
 Leirn: So go to easy challenges and try them
 123456789LL: ok
 123456789LL: where do i go
 LastRick: Welcome to Codingame!
 123456789LL: Thx
 Leirn: Trainings&#160;?
 Leirn: (I don't have it in english, that's a guess)
 LastRick: 123456789LL &gt; Practice &gt; Easy
 Leirn: Thanks LastRick
 123456789LL: Is that a link cuz if so i cant click it
 Leirn: That's not, the the description of the menus you have to follow
 123456789LL: Ohh
 123456789LL: im in one
 Leirn: So read, try, experiment, search
 Leirn: That's learning by doing
 LastRick: Go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/home">https://www.codingame.com/home</a> and click on the first yellow box of the map you can do. Maybe it's Introduction or The COmmunity Awaits You
 123456789LL: Ok
 LastRick: Maybe we should have a Tutorial Island.
 123456789LL: Yea
 jacek: oh my
 123456789LL: I’m done
 LastRick: At Codingame you're never really done
 eulerscheZahl: and if you are, you can upload your own content and cause some work for others :P
 eulerscheZahl: or even when you are not done yourself
 123456789LL: Ok
 AntiSquid: did you swap your username with your password somehow?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't need LL, it's below the integer limit
 mzbear: maybe he isn't willing to wait for a promotion
 LastRick: Weird. All a sudden CG wants to see my clipboard history? This is because I'm getting so close to legend in CSB isn't it?
 struct: cg never asked me for clipboard history
 mzbear: if he's shifting himself around, it might necessitate the LL to avoid having himself cast into something bigger than himself
 LastRick: odd
 struct: And I cant see a reason for cg to need it
 eulerscheZahl: did you accidentally enter CG for work?
 LastRick: what do you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: The #1 tech hiring platform
 LastRick: hahah oh that pop up that appears every time you level up
 eulerscheZahl: the new footer
 struct: Is this clipboard history is the windows feature right?
 eulerscheZahl: i level up so rarely these days, i already forgot how it looks
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what clipboard history is
 LastRick: ^ weird flex but ok&#160;:)
 Uljahn: could be some malicious addon though
 eulerscheZahl: personally I use parcellite
 RedBlur: hello guys
 eulerscheZahl: malicious addon sounds more likely than CG to me
 LastRick: yeah, thats my fear
 MaximusG: monkey
 MaximusG: ooh ooh
 MaximusG: i like monkey
 Uljahn: understandable, have a nice day, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think i know what i'm doing
 jacek: AutomatonNN how many hidden nodes you have
 AutomatonNN: good night
 Stilgart: AutomatonNN: have a break, have a turtle
 AutomatonNN: with the same code i was looking for a bunch of information and stuff
 Astrobytes: AutomatonNN: Vive la tortue!
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the solutions in the same location and all that in the beginning
 Astrobytes: lol. hi Stilgart
 Stilgart: hi Astrobytes
 jacek: at least games on CG dont have bugs like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgamebugs/comments/kacs8f/this_was_the_first_decent_bug_tbh/">https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgamebugs/comments/kacs8f/this_was_the_first_decent_bug_tbh/</a>
 Astrobytes: thanks for that jacek
 jacek: youre welcome
 struct: These marketing strategies
 Astrobytes: played it yet?
 struct: no
 struct: Not really my kind of games
 MaximusG: sorry but im playing mario bros ds
 Astrobytes: oh you again
 LastRick: Have those alignment dots always been there in the IDE? Have I just never noticed them?
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: Not seeing any dots here
 LastRick: when you highlight code in the IDE, i see a string of dots on the left side
 Astrobytes: ah yeah
 Astrobytes: tbh, I'm not sure if it's new or not :D
 LastRick: yeah i cant recall it
 struct: you can remove that
 AntiSquid: LastRick when is rick and morty season 5 out?
 LastRick: what a delightfully random question. Next year, you gotta think
 JBM: let's ask NextMorty
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 why would i get snarky remarks at a legit and interesting question?
 Automaton2000: so if i want a t-shirt
 AntiSquid: the only other question i could ask would only confirm i need a full rewrite for this messy bot of mine
 Astrobytes: snarky remarks?
 AntiSquid: replies? what do you wish to call them 
 Astrobytes: no no, I meant I didn't see anything snarky, only humorous
 AntiSquid: humorous at my expense Q_Q
 Astrobytes: you're too sensitive sometimes :P
 AntiSquid: random promotion in bit runner huh
 Astrobytes: what league were you in?
 AntiSquid: promoted to 4
 AntiSquid: my only change:cout &lt;&lt; "0 0 200 message" &lt;&lt; endl; // X Y THRUST MESSAGEand then golf the starter
 Astrobytes: enjoy the next leagues :D

 ToshiTuringMachine: well you just add random chars until you reach the "size"
 Has.n0.id: hello
 wirdes: hi&#160;:)
 noobcodeer3546: hi
 therealbeef: ah 01:15am, servers taking a break as usual
 IamFish: was wondering if something was wrong with my internet
 therealbeef: nah, it's the same story every night
 IamFish: damn, guess i'm done with clash of code for the night then
 therealbeef: yeah, a subtle hint to go to sleep&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: It's when the points update
 Astrobytes: CP that is
 therealbeef: can't they spread it more over the day?
 Astrobytes: CG are based in France, it's 1-1:30 AM so it suits their servers&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: don't shoot the messenger, just passing the info on&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: anyway, I am tired. gn all
 therealbeef: it's probably the time with the least players
 Astrobytes: yeah, most likely 
 Astrobytes: goodnight!
 therealbeef: laters
 struct: I reported it on discord
 struct: They think it may be a bug caused when they updated db
 elderlybeginner: are there some server issues right now?
 struct: I think its good now
 IamFish: there was. seems good now
 elderlybeginner: editor works strange
 elderlybeginner: it's underlineing everything for me
 struct: Have you tried refreshing?
 LastRick: Aw dang, i missed the nightly slow down
 therealbeef: and the complaining about it :D
 MadKnight: hey hey
 MadKnight: anyone still there&#160;?
 MadKnight: are u guys doing some fancy coding&#160;?
 LastRick: I just created a new Class object that would knock your socks off
 MadKnight: that's boring
 MadKnight: create a fancy reusable BFS algo that u can use in any multi
 MadKnight: like reuse
 LastRick: copy and paste from another contest or game? Uh huh, no way.
 therealbeef: generic solutions are always the second best solution
 MadKnight: but it's a basic thing
 MadKnight: don't u copy paste Vector class&#160;?
 MadKnight: i'm talking about template solutions therealbeef
 therealbeef: a handwritten solution for a specific problem can usually beat any generic one
 MadKnight: yea but u can write such a generic solution that it can handle any custom stuff while still looking good
 MadKnight: and while being optimized
 MadKnight: for example - BFS
 therealbeef: ok, if you put enough hooks into the generic algo that you can still tweak it enough
 MadKnight: just put logical hooks
 MadKnight: wanna see my generic BFS&#160;?
 therealbeef: is the algorithm itself a template parameter?&#160;;-)
 MadKnight: ofc
 MadKnight: that's a generic anything
 MadKnight: generic class Anything
 MadKnight: but i'm not talking about Anything now
 MadKnight: therealbeef the thing that makes it possible is to only add hooks that don't change the basic algo
 therealbeef: true
 therealbeef: i find it gets very hooky though at some point
 therealbeef: i've been writing an alpha-beta negamax like that
 therealbeef: still curious to see if it will extend to other multis easily
 MadKnight: lemme see your AB NM
 mzbear: Argh, my Blocking bot sometimes sees more valid moves available than what the referee provides, sometimes less ... I have to debug the differences when referee provides 259 moves and my own code only sees 236
 ToshiTuringMachine: i bought the blocking real game
 ToshiTuringMachine: it's named blockus and it's lovely. gonna give it as a present to my friend on xmas
 ToshiTuringMachine: blokus
 MuddySneakers: I'm sitting here next to my copy of the real game. Find it useful to be able to play w/ the pieces while coding my player. Helps visualize things.

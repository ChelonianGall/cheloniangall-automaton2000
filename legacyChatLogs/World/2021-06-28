 derjack: sokoban puzzle of the week eh
 Westicles: a fine choice
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah congratulation to the bot&#160;!
 ableflyer: guys what must your rank be to become a clash of code pro
 KP56: top 100?
 KP56: i think
 nuggetbucket54: i think that is depending on how many games you play not ur ranking but i might be mistaken
 nuggetbucket54: i have clash of code legend but that is only because i played a bit (500 games) not because i'm actually any good
 KP56: trueskill depends on how good opponents who you beat are
 KP56: so yes it is your skill
 KP56: also i didnt know you can get a rank in coc
 Uljahn: the rank is not permanent and decays over time
 KP56: in Chuk Norris (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris-codesize">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris-codesize</a>) does space also count as a character?
 KP56: because my program fails tests containing space for some reason
 BlaiseEbuth: "ASCII characters"
 KP56: hm special characters are also messed up
 Siddhesh18: space is an ASCII character with value 32
 KP56: yes but my solution does not match tests but only if someone inputs non-literals
 KP56: which is weird considering i use this: bin(ord(i))[2:] 
 TYJung: how do you do the 2nd lvl for uh hh the checkpoint thingy
 TYJung: im using bash
 TYJung: im using bash
 KP56: what checkpoint thingy
 KP56: coders strike back?
 TYJung: ah ye
 TYJung: soz im new to coding
 KP56: learn some other language, bash is very limited
 TYJung: oh then which do u prefer to use
 KP56: and if you were to try any othe more complex challenge it would be impossible to solve with bash
 TYJung: c++?
 KP56: you can use c++, python is an option, java, c#, ruby, javascript
 KP56: every single one of these is good
 TYJung: uh ok ill use c++ but how do u do the angle thingy with g++
 TYJung: c++
 KP56: if (angle &lt; 90) thrust = 0;
 KP56: thats what you mean?
 KP56: if (angle &gt; 90 || angle &lt; -90) thrust = 0;
 TYJung: huh
 KP56: int thrust = 100;
 TYJung: ye but it says that
 KP56: if (nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90 || nextCheckpointAngle &lt; -90) thrust = 0;
 KP56: and then
 KP56: cout &lt;&lt; nextCheckpointX &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; nextCheckpointY &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; thrust &lt;&lt; endl;
 TYJung: ah
 TYJung: ok
 KiwiTae: y
 TYJung: thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: Come back when you'll have passed to the next league, KP56 will give you his code...
 KP56: you basically create a new space in memory called "thrust", then you set it to the value 100, if the angle between next checkpoint is higher than 90, then we want to set thrust to 0
 KP56: has anyone here solved the chuck norris puzzle in python?
 Uljahn: sure
 KiwiTae: ya 
 KiwiTae: im stuck at 89 ~
 Westicles: compressed?
 Uljahn: same
 KiwiTae: ya&#160;:/
 Westicles: yeah me too.  I'm curious about that c/obj c solution under 60
 Westicles: too many people, either it is obvious or it is published somewhere
 KP56: stuck at what
 KP56: oh chuck norris
 KP56: i was asking because i have this code and it doesn't work with special symbols
 KP56: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/120b2c11-4005-414e-a942-f906188e58b5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/120b2c11-4005-414e-a942-f906188e58b5</a>
 KP56: it only passes tests 1, 2 and 5
 Uljahn: "The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)", the most common problem is for "%" char the binary has only 6-bit length because of a leading zero
 KP56: oh thank you
 KP56: FINALLY IT WORKS
 KP56: im so grateful
 KP56: i wouldnt have figured it out without your help
 Uljahn: sorry for ruining the fun of debugging challenge
 KP56: since when is debugging fun
 Uljahn: always has been
 samiriscool: ayyyyyyyy how u doing coding gang
 Orwell983: How could I test assesmeny for a C++ and OOP profile?
 JEDWF: which site is the best to learn coding
 KP56: if you already know syntax
 KP56: you can check codewarriors out, it has some very simple puzzles to teach you basics, then you can come back here 
 JEDWF: thank you&#160;!
 TeKI_Dubz: @samiriscool coding gang is not good
 samiriscool: nah coding gang never dies, am i right boys?
 KP56: is implementing mini max after an x amount of moves to decrease possibilities in Ultimate tic tac toe a good idea?
 derjack: hm?
 KP56: instead of using it since the beggining to see for example 10 moves deep and try to evaluate who has an advantage
 KP56: create a simple AI and just start using minimax after an X amount of moves
 KP56: im asking which option is better
 MSmits: KP56 i have no idea what you are saying
 Uljahn: first x moves are most important, do you book them or use MCTS?
 MSmits: are you asking KP56?
 Uljahn: ye
 KP56: what i mean is im trying to make an AI and implement minimax in it, since minimax is score based, i could just make it look through every single possibility for example 10-20 moves ahead and try to evaluate who has an advantage instead of who has won
 TeKI_Dubz: @samiriscool rip coding gang
 MSmits: what you are describing is just minimax KP56
 MSmits: yes minimax is an option
 KP56: oh nvm then
 MSmits: you wont get 20 moves ahead though
 KiwiTae: KP56 check aCat minimax puzzle 
 MSmits: it's more like 10 max
 KP56: ok thanks
 MSmits: mcts seems more effective on uttt, but minimax does work
 MSmits: you can get to legend with it
 KiwiTae: MSmits no trains today? :D
 MSmits: no trains today, tomorrow though
 MSmits: and friday
 MSmits: I need to finish grading some stuff 
 MSmits: reports from experiments done by students. They take half an hour each and i need to grade 18 of them still&#160;:(
 KiwiTae: no gaussian drop on top of the stairs?
 KiwiTae: :p
 MSmits: gaussian drop?
 MSmits: is this some experiment to determine gravitational acceleration or something?
 MSmits: if so, that would have been an ok option for a similar assignment
 KiwiTae: drop the reports from a stair cases ,white noise grading
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: nope&#160;:)
 MSmits: some of them are bad, some are good, I need to actually read them
 KiwiTae:&#160;:) tough life 
 MSmits: heh it's ok. Grading my html/css assignment was easier though
 KiwiTae:  I would make a terrible teacher &gt;&lt;
 MSmits: form is quicker to grade than content
 MSmits: dont know until you try KiwiTae
 MSmits: maybe you would make an excellent teacher because you are already setting the bar too high for yourself
 MSmits: my first year as a teacher I was always thinking I messed up
 MSmits: but noone else seemed to think so
 MSmits: it's a hard job to start out in because you immediately get the same responsibility as every teacher that has been doing it for 30 years
 MSmits: some jobs ease you into it, but this is not one of those
 MSmits: so.. here's your classroom, with 30 young adults here, have fun, dodge the paper planes.
 MSmits: (I;m exaggerating but not by much)
 MSmits: with experience it becomes deceptively easy though
 MSmits: you can get lazy and stop improving, that's a pitfall
 KiwiTae: :grimacing: sorry i was getting my shot ~ it gets easier so you get more time for research
 Wontonimo: good morning (or afternoon, or whereever you are on this pale blue dot)
 Wontonimo: I haven't taught children in a classroom, but I have done corporate tech training.
 Wontonimo: I agree MSmits, doing the same course a few times sure makes it easier
 MSmits: well it's almost never exactly the same course, but the gain in time is mostly from the fact that you don't have to specify every action you take during class, when preparing. You can mostly "wing it"
 MSmits: but therein also lies the lazy part. Wing it too much and you're not a very good teacher
 Wontonimo: :thumpsup:
 Wontonimo: lol ... :thumbsup:
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: for example,, I could get away with just using the powerpoint from last year in most cases
 Wontonimo: yeah, and then part of you would die
 MSmits: but if i want to be good, i will check it for mistakes or i'll be making the same mistake every year
 MSmits: and sometimes there are new developments
 MSmits: or the content of the course subtly changed
 MSmits: content is decided on a national level and that changes every so many years
 Wontonimo: or you discover a recurring cognitive hurdle in the student population, and make a special focus point to help with that 
 MSmits: we get new teaching materials too, about once every 6-7 years (new books)
 MSmits: Wontonimo yeah exactly
 MSmits: this is physics btw, for CS we dont have any books. We write all our own stuff
 MSmits: or cobble it together from various sources
 MSmits: in that sense CS classes take more time to prepare, but grading is generally easier
 Wontonimo: I was tutoring some very young children with serious math issues a long time ago.  It seemed from the mistakes they were making they could do simple math with 1-10, and from 20-100 but not from 11-19
 Wontonimo: so I got them to say "ten-ty one, ten-ty two" and all their problems went away after 5 min
 MSmits: ah yeah
 Wontonimo: i was pretty proud of that one.  It was the whole english teens that was tripping them up for years
 MSmits: it's confusing
 MSmits: same in my language
 MSmits: tien, elf, twaalf, der*tien*, veer*tien* etc.
 Wontonimo: there are probably many many programming and science ones that you've seen.  so many that you probably don't even realize that you are helping and rephrasing for the benefit of the students
 MSmits: yeah that sort of thing becomes automatic
 MSmits: I realize this when I am assisting an intern who never taught before
 MSmits: then you realize how much of this stuff you do right without even knowing
 PaulSurzh: I can't do "verbal" math at all. I always have to imagine what the number looks like, do the math and only then tell the answer.
 MSmits: anyway, good convo, but gotta do some shopping before it gets late&#160;:(
 MSmits: ttyl
 Wontonimo: me too PaulSurzh, so the whole "teens" number thing never effected me as a child.
 Wontonimo: I don't know how a person could do "verbal" math for algebra or calculus 
 PaulSurzh: Well, I guess actual math isn't supposed to be done "verbally" at all. I was mostly talking about arithmetic.
 PaulSurzh: Also, my native language isn't English, but we also have the "teens" thing. I think it's pretty common among languages.
 Wontonimo: PaulSurzh have you tried any of the bot programming&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 PaulSurzh: Not yet, I'm most solving puzzles now.
 MSmits: once easy puzzles become trivial i think you can succesfully do many multis
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: If you want to, obviously
 MSmits: yeah, I never really went back to puzzles, except when i wanted to learn python
 MSmits: I still enjoy them, I just enjoy multis more
 Astrobytes: Yeah puzzles are great for trying out other languages
 MSmits: nine men's morris is still in contribution. I keep waiting for it to appear on the list
 Astrobytes: Do you have a bot for it?
 MSmits: no, i havent had time for it, but if it becomes a multi i will for sure write one
 MSmits: It seems like a great game to practice supervised learning on
 MSmits: because you can solve it locally
 MSmits: and then train a NN to eval states
 Astrobytes: everyone's going in on the machine learning huh
 MSmits: to me it's just a tool i dont know yet
 aminzeos: hey guys
 MSmits: like mcts, endgame book creation, meta mcts etc.
 Astrobytes: I saw Marchet e tech.io article, what a great job he did
 MSmits: definitely
 PaulSurzh: Sorry, I'm new here, what is multi?
 MSmits: games played by bots
 MSmits: with a leaderboard
 PaulSurzh: Ah, okay, thanks.
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Astrobytes: There are quite a few to choose from&#160;;)
 MSmits: the reason NMM seems great to me is my first succesful ML project was supervised learning TTT, also a solved game
 MSmits: I could expand this to a more complex solved game.
 MSmits: its a smaller step than oware
 Astrobytes: Yes, would be a good starting point, I agree
 PaulSurzh: Yeah, Wontonimo has already recommended tham to me, I just didn't know they were called multies.
 PaulSurzh: *them
 Astrobytes: Ah ok, sorry&#160;:)
 MSmits: they are called multies or arenas
 MSmits: or just bot games
 MSmits: some of them are ex-contests 
 MSmits: the ex-contest ones have complex rules and are hard to simulate
 MSmits: (generally)
 MSmits: the rest are super simple and great to practice search algortihms with
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: ┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Astrobytes: have you misplaced your vowels again Blaise?
 darkhorse64: ankle injury&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :D
 BobTschigerillo: :joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy:
 MSmits: is there a rule like, when the emotes use a 2nd line it's too many
 Astrobytes: There should be.
 MSmits: agreed
 BobTschigerillo: :joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy::joy:
 Astrobytes: Would you like a kick BobTschigerillo?
 BlaiseEbuth: He want
 Astrobytes: That counted as a warn then kick I guess :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Which vowels btw?
 MSmits: only you know
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: do you know a nigel&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. No. Was my answer to the lol of Astrobytes
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: that doesn't help :P
 Astrobytes: "the lol of Astrobytes" sounds like a book or something

 dbdr: 2 CGers in top 10&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: That bob guy wants a ban btw, he DMd me
 MSmits: hey whats that
 dbdr: a contest euler mentioned on the chat
 Astrobytes: Nice, good job dbdr!
 dbdr: then he did not join :D
 dbdr: thanks
 dbdr: CG experience definitely helps
 dbdr: though the referee is not public, need to reverse enginner it :D
 MSmits: yeah no idea what it is, but plenty of opposition, so gj
 dbdr: small compared to cg contests
 dbdr: unfortunately there is still time for me to get reckt
 Astrobytes: It's asteroids game basically MSmits
 MSmits: ah ok
 dbdr: there is some kind of trip to the ICPC championship as first prize, if I understood correctly
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/">https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/</a>
 Astrobytes: nice
 MSmits: a swag bag
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: that makes it worth it
 Astrobytes: Yes, presumably one dropped by a burglar MSmits 
 MSmits: once you have that, you got swag
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: this should be on your profile dbdr
 MSmits: i won a coding contest and now I got swag
 dbdr: I haven't won yet :D
 Astrobytes: All your swag are belong to me
 MSmits: we'll see
 MSmits:  lol
 dbdr: I'll put it if I do, in your honor&#160;;)
 MSmits: cool&#160;:)
 BobCicerillo: im back
 Astrobytes: hold on to that lead!
 AllYourTrees: AllYourSwag?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Good-one: hello world&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: they recommend 4ms of compute per frame.  That's a very small time budget
 dbdr: yeah
 Wontonimo: seems like it is only enough for if/else bots.  Are you doing any simulation in that time?
 dbdr: I am doing a sim
 Astrobytes: banked?
 dbdr: I think it's global limit, yes
 Astrobytes: Ah cool
 Wontonimo: +1 for sim 
 dbdr: in rust, without libs, and the input is json :D
 AllYourTrees: aww yisss rust
 dbdr: so manual parser
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: and if you get it wrong "Run Time Error" with no feedback :D
 MSmits: this is why it's hard to go outside CG for contests. The conditions are almost always worse
 MSmits: so once you go CG...
 Wontonimo: i understand the attraction of using json, but have these people actually tried parsing in every language?
 dbdr: C++ and python are officially supported
 dbdr: they added a json parser to cpp
 BobTschicerillo: Hello
 Wontonimo: "Run time error" with no feedback&#160;;( It would almost be easier to code with punchcards
 dbdr: well, you can run locally against a compiled referee. except somehow it has different input format (spacing)
 Wontonimo: you know, just to spice things up
 Astrobytes: Jeez :D
 dbdr: yeah, was fun. I was ready to give up several times, was not even sure to start
 dbdr: happy I did now, whatever the final result
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: no referee, no visual, 3 days to reverse the mechanics and write a bot -&gt; no fun
 Astrobytes: best of luck man, hope you keep that lead
 BobTschigerilo: Im back guys
 BobTschicerillo: hope u fail
 BobTschicerillo: retard
 Astrobytes: bye Bob
 BobTschigerilo: retard
 BobTschigerilo: which one
 BobTschicerillo: i have infinite accounts
 BobTschicerillo: bob tschigerillo is great
 BobTschicerillo: forever
 BobTschicerillo: Or should i say
 BobTschicerillo: Bob Cicerillo
 dbdr: darkhorse64, there are visuals locally, in Unity
 dbdr: and a python visualizer they build in a couple of hours because ppl had issues, pretty cool
 dbdr: also, reverse can be fun, as long as it's clear it's part of the challenge
 darkhorse64: oh, I rage quit within the first minutes mostly because I did not have the time, so i miss that.
 MSmits: did you quit like Bob :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Bob didn't quit, he was quitted.
 Astrobytes: The Bobs got banned
 MSmits: true
 darkhorse64: the multiple heads one&#160;? I am sure mods are faster to cut his heads
 MSmits: he has infinite accounts though
 Astrobytes: I have infinite bans
 MSmits: true
 darkhorse64: infinite powa
 Astrobytes: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: But infinite patience&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No. Even I have a breaking point.
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. So we have to make a bot to autoban him before you reach that point.
 Astrobytes: A ban bot would be great.BAN 9000
 darkhorse64: a moron killer
 Wontonimo: how do the current Automate2000 and ML bots work?
 Wontonimo: afa integration?
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/</a>
 Automaton2000: yeah but i have to start somewhere
 Astrobytes: Grr.
 zsltg: or create a multiplayer game where the goal is to write a more effective moderation bot&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: write an a0 that learns from mods how to ban&#160;?
 Wontonimo: does world chat use IRC protocol?
 BlaiseEbuth: xmpp
 BlaiseEbuth: do you want vowels&#160;?
 Astrobytes: XMPP
 Astrobytes: oh
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Wontonimo: using additional details like the users global ranking, XP, and if they have bothered to add an image would all be great additional signals
 Wontonimo: not absolute signals, but at least help to not ban me 
 BlaiseEbuth: First thing i'll teach to the bot is to ban you...
 Astrobytes: I can imagine the ban bot seriously annoying a lot of people, initially at least :D
 Wontonimo: initial version could just be text warnings in world chat
 RoboStac: you want to combat spam by having a bot add more spam?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ^
 BlaiseEbuth: Fire by fire&#160;!
 Outhous3: helo
 dbdr: lol, I forgot to sim the damage to my ship
 zsltg: invincible ship? :thinking:

 eulerscheZahl: dbdr is actually playing that contest?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, there's some material to download now - that's new
 eulerscheZahl: and even a video - how could I miss that? :D
 eulerscheZahl: i see my fault: i expected that all the information was given in the problem statement on kattis. while same of the info was on icpc.global exclusively
 eulerscheZahl: i also assumed that the contest would end today instead of tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: oh, dbdr is first :owell done little prince
 BlaiseEbuth: little prince&#160;? Oo
 eulerscheZahl: of Persia
 BlaiseEbuth: oh
 eulerscheZahl: but seriously: why is there a long problem statement on kattis that doesn't even mention the 25 page pdf with more detailed rules on another website
 eulerscheZahl: that's stupid
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm 90% sure that the contest should end today and not tomorrow
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a trap
 eulerscheZahl: i wish dbdr good luck. but i'm happy i didn't get myself into this
 eulerscheZahl: the handbook even has a chapter called "6.2. Bugs / Discrepancies with the Problem Spec"
 eulerscheZahl: "How do I quit the game? "Use your OS’s Task Manager to force-quit.
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, the end was postponed because of a major bug in the statement
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 eulerscheZahl: did that statement bug affect you?
 dbdr: NinjaDoggy reversed the issue
 dbdr: yeah, it affected me too. but was not too hard to adapt
 eulerscheZahl: still some ideas for improvements?
 eulerscheZahl: is the "80" below your score the number of submits?
 dbdr: yes, better reverse the engine&#160;;)
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: about 20 of those were for blind debugging my manual json parser :D

 TipuTare: whats wrong with this code
 Astrobytes: It doesn't work.
 eulerscheZahl: you should initialize the index and maxmountain inside the main loop
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Captain obvious
 Astrobytes: :D
 TipuTare: oh
 TipuTare: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1c3b4e54-70bd-4004-b6de-c4c447c809e0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1c3b4e54-70bd-4004-b6de-c4c447c809e0</a>
 TipuTare: still not working tho
 Astrobytes: Are you sure it's i you want to print?
 eulerscheZahl: now you made me open the puzzle, are you happy now?
 TipuTare: i need the index of the highest mountain
 MSmits: should work
 eulerscheZahl: print(index)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, astro said that already
 Astrobytes: Yup.
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: btw, i would suggest variable names that are more clear
 TipuTare: why the frick was i printing the i?
 MSmits: like "tallest_height"
 TipuTare: i think im stupid
 MSmits: and "best_index
 MSmits: index is easy to confuse with i
 TipuTare: ty
 MSmits: because poor naming
 Astrobytes: No, you're not stupid. We all make mistakes.
 eulerscheZahl: but what's "best"?
 MSmits: sure do
 TipuTare: still not working  tho
 MSmits: the best target to shoot
 eulerscheZahl: that judgemental
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's a good character trait when shooting mountains
 TipuTare: wait but its still not working
 eulerscheZahl: index_of_most_dangerous_mountain
 MSmits: share the code again&#160;:)
 MSmits: sure, do that :P
 eulerscheZahl: works for me TipuTare

 eulerscheZahl: all green
 MSmits: green is good
 TipuTare: oh idk why it didnt work for me
 TipuTare: nvm im dumb
 eulerscheZahl: we had that already
 TipuTare: i declared them inside the for
 TipuTare: ty man
 MSmits: TipuTare i had problems with this puzzle when i just got to CG
 MSmits: did not understand the input/output structure
 TipuTare: how old are you?
 MSmits: ancient
 TipuTare: and what language should i learn?
 eulerscheZahl: 29 :older_man:
 TipuTare: lol
 MSmits: 40 here :P
 Astrobytes: 38
 TipuTare: im 14
 AllYourTrees: 28
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you had a carry-through MSmits
 MSmits: whats that?
 eulerscheZahl: carryover*
 eulerscheZahl: me making up new words
 MSmits: ok, but what does it mean
 eulerscheZahl: 39+1=40
 eulerscheZahl: changing the first digit
 MSmits: ohhh ok
 MSmits: well this was in februari so been a while
 ZarthaxX: smito 40
 ZarthaxX: toad 29
 ZarthaxX: astro 38
 ZarthaxX: oh noeeesss
 Astrobytes: almost 39
 MSmits: if you repeat it, it's easier to remember ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: NOOOOOOOOO
 eulerscheZahl: almost 30 :scream:
 ZarthaxX: right :P
 ZarthaxX: CG is getting older
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl you're not so old&#160;! :o I though so
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: how old did you see me BlaiseEbuth?
 MSmits: I never remember my age, it's more efficient to calculate it. It's only 1 operation and 1 stored number
 TipuTare: whats input().split()
 BlaiseEbuth: Zarthold&#160;!
 ZarthaxX: nice one :P
 Astrobytes: OldaxX
 eulerscheZahl: input()&#160;: reads a line from stdin - codingame will give you that line
 eulerscheZahl: split()&#160;: split at spaces
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't knwo exactly eZ but... About 40... :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: so "1 2 3".split() will become ["1", "2", "3"]
 MSmits: when I let students try python on CG puzzles, they always get confused by the input split thingy
 Astrobytes: lol really Blaise? :D
 TipuTare: ok ty
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. He's so calm and wise... I really thought he was older ^^
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just an impostor of a wise person
 MSmits: which one?
 MSmits: gandalf?
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's lord of the rings, isn't it?
 ZarthaxX: nice one too astro :P
 MSmits: ok so not gandalf
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too young to have seen that :P
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 MSmits: Dumbledore?
 eulerscheZahl: i know harry potter
 MSmits: good
 eulerscheZahl: but *spoiler alert* dumbledore died
 TipuTare: anime?
 MSmits: mmh if you imitate a dead person it doesnt mean you have to die too
 MSmits: thats not how that works
 MSmits: "i'm gonna be just like Einstein". "Ok let me get a coffin" 
 eulerscheZahl: so i can admire van Gogh without cutting my ear off?
 MSmits: you got it :P
 eulerscheZahl: btw tomorrow is Kotlin heroes again on codeforces
 MSmits: why does kotlin make you a hero?
 MSmits: I did a course on kotlin once
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/92165">https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/92165</a>
 Astrobytes: Bet you felt heroic afterwards.
 MSmits: did not feel like a hero. I feel like a wrote a bunch of one liners and forgot what they did in 5 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: that's how i play those contests
 eulerscheZahl: there are about 3 months between the rounds, i have to start from 0 every time
 TipuTare: what should i learn first guys?
 TipuTare: what language
 eulerscheZahl: but intellij has a java-&gt;kotlin translator
 BlaiseEbuth: brainfuck
 MSmits: what do you want to use it for TipuTare?
 MSmits: languages are made for specific purposes
 TipuTare: to become a software engineer  i guess
 MSmits: yeah that's not very specific&#160;:)
 TipuTare: then tell me what is phyton used for
 BlaiseEbuth: Try java, and you gonna be an "expert"
 BlaiseEbuth: Python is used for bad programs
 MSmits: i saw a table where it said java engineers are the lowest paid
 MSmits: and clojure the highest paid
 BlaiseEbuth: Normal
 AllYourTrees: python for bad programs??
 eulerscheZahl: python is commonly used for machine learning, quick prototyping
 TipuTare: what about c++&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: good one
 MSmits: c++ is a bad place to start imho
 eulerscheZahl: with Django and flask there are popular web frameworks for Python
 MSmits: C# is nice, python is nice (for short programs)
 TipuTare: i already know it cause thats what we do at school
 TipuTare: what languages did u guys start off with?
 MSmits: C#
 BlaiseEbuth: C
 eulerscheZahl: my first was Delphi
 MSmits: ignoring visual basic, because everyone should
 Astrobytes: BASIC
 eulerscheZahl: but i wouldn't recommend delphi or basic
 Uljahn: basic and asm
 eulerscheZahl: actually it was Turbo Pascal for me
 TipuTare: and what u guys doing .. websites?
 BlaiseEbuth: Salting chats
 MSmits: I write bots for codingame mostly. and teaching material for my job
 eulerscheZahl: mostly windows desktop applications at work
 MSmits: for job, mostly python, for bots, mostly c++
 TipuTare: oh so should i start with phyton?
 Astrobytes: Well you're already learning it, so learn it well
 eulerscheZahl: there is no clear right or wrong answer to this question
 eulerscheZahl: but stick with it once you chose a language until you feel comfortable with it
 MSmits: python is nice for learning computational thinking, but it hides some of the complexity of how programs run. So you won't get a complete education at first. But this is ok
 TipuTare: and what website do u recommend i learn it?
 TipuTare: from what website*
 MSmits: i did not learn coding from a website so not sure
 MSmits: I mostly learned from modding space engineers. You can still do this btw, it's on steam&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: this one is good once you're relatively comfortable with the basics of your language
 TipuTare: i used to  do a course in real life but it was c++
 TipuTare: and only console
 TipuTare: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hyperskill.org/">https://hyperskill.org/</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: If you stay on python, learn on the python website.
 TipuTare: what about this one
 Astrobytes: But you have to be prepared to use your search powers and read the language reference
 Astrobytes: (when necessary, not from start to finish)
 MSmits: AntiSquid, didnt you have some good websites to learn coding?
 MSmits:  I pinged him, so you might get an anwer at some point later today TipuTare&#160;:)
 TipuTare: ok ty
 MSmits: there's a few guys on here that strongly recommend some site, but i forgot which one
 MSmits: maybe coder camp or some such
 MSmits: try google that
 Astrobytes: As BlaiseEbuth said, if you stick with python, the python website has a lot of useful resources
 MSmits: yeah but does it have a project too?
 MSmits: you need to have some kind of goal
 sprkrd: maybe I will get banned for this, but what about Coursera?
 MSmits: or specific exercises
 zsltg: the official website definitely <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a> or maybe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://realpython.com/">https://realpython.com/</a>&#160;?
 Astrobytes: You can search for that elsewhere MSmits
 MSmits: thats true
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://diveintopython3.net/">https://diveintopython3.net/</a>
 MSmits: btw if TipuTare knows a bit of c++ and knows how loops and conditions work and such. Just google + python might be enough to solve some easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: That's why I suggested here first if he's relatively comfortable with it
 MSmits: yeah
 TipuTare: sprkrd dont risk getting banned just for me man
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/">https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/</a>
 Astrobytes: Isn't edx better than coursera? (I'm not sure either way)
 MSmits: i think the most important part of learning to code is not giving up. Motivation is everything here
 TipuTare: should i the courses here on codingame?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Be curious. Break stuff, fix stuff, make things.
 eulerscheZahl: no one will get banned for recommending Coursera
 TipuTare: ok guys thanks
 MSmits: except infinite bob
 Astrobytes: InfiniBob gets banned for existing.
 MSmits: yeah
 TipuTare: See ya 
 TipuTare: byeee
 eulerscheZahl: is that a user I missed?
 MSmits: bye&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: bye
 MSmits: trust me, you won't miss him
 Astrobytes: Bye TipuTare&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah. InfiniBob has infinite accounts you know.
 MSmits: he called Astrobytes a retard :shock:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?search=InfiniBob&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;profile=all&amp;fulltext=1">https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?search=InfiniBob&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;profile=all&amp;fulltext=1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: "There were no results matching the query."
 Astrobytes: it was earlier this afternoon.
 eulerscheZahl: oh, then i have to wait until tomorrow
 MSmits: Astrobytes did a deep removal
 MSmits: all trace of infinite bob are gone
 Astrobytes: And InfiniBob is not his username. Just one I have assigned to him.
 MSmits: yeah because he said he had infinite accounts
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl Yeah I know, it was a joke because I know some people don't like learning from videos :joy:
 MSmits: i really dislike learning anything with coding from a video
 MSmits: I need to be able to copy paste stuff
 MSmits: I dont like being stuck to the pace of a video also
 Astrobytes: It was BobTschigerilllo, BobTschigerillo, BobTschigerilo, BobCigerilllo etc etc
 eulerscheZahl: that bob said hi on #de yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: oh, he came back today and i missed it&#160;:(
 MSmits: oh so he was already mad because you banned him there
 sprkrd: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZjd_Y1gJ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZjd_Y1gJ8</a>
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZjd_Y1gJ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZjd_Y1gJ8</a>
 sprkrd: sorry
 sprkrd: got something messed up in my clipboard
 eulerscheZahl: ban
 sprkrd: I was saying that I mostly dislike learning from videos too, but I enjoy some videos for the ideas rather than for the code
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yeah some are nice
 Astrobytes: I like some lectures and stuff too if I'm learning new things.
 sprkrd: then I copied the link for an example video and deleted my original message :joy:
 MSmits: this is the best tutorial site i know: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/">https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: if i'm completely new to a topic, a video tutorial is fine for me
 MSmits: all written
 eulerscheZahl: if i have some understanding already, i get impatient, skip forward and miss the part i was looking for. wasting more time than when watching in normal speed
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm guilty of that
 sprkrd: that happens a lot with machine learning stuff, when they re-explain the same thing in every single video
 MSmits: same
 sprkrd: like what is overfitting, what is underfitting, etc etc
 MSmits: yup. I also think 95% of people watching ML videos never get beyond the basics. People are interested in it, but when you get into the real stuff, it's hard work
 sprkrd: because it starts with linear regression videos, and people's preconceived idea usually comes from the movies
 sprkrd: "what's all these math things you're trying to teach me, i want sci-fi stuff!"
 AllYourTrees: ML is interesting because the frameworks make things so "easy" now, but its still at the point where no one really understands why things work so you still need in depth knowledge to set hyperparameters effectively
 Astrobytes: and other media
 Astrobytes: (re. preconceived ideas)
 Wontonimo: that is an overstatement about noone knowing why things work.  Also, the idea that ML is a black box is very overstated 
 BlaiseEbuth: It's a blackbox... If you use a plugin that do everything
 BlaiseEbuth: *lib
 Wontonimo: so true
 MSmits: it's more that we understand the parts and not the whole. a NN has a lot of emergent behavior. Like a biologer will understand what cells do, but it's hard to translate that to the workings of the entire organism
 MSmits: the complexity just gets very high. it's supposed to. There's a reason we replace a game state evaluation with a neural network. It's exactly because the complexity of the game got too high for us to grasp all at once. 
 MSmits: that doesnt mean we don't "understand" neural networks
 MSmits: it's that if we could split the inner workings into parts and understand them separately, we wouldn't need a neural network in the first place
 MSmits: because we could have come up with the parts ourselves and stick them together (like a normal minimax eval)
 MSmits: the lack of "understanding" in the traditional sense is by design
 therealbeef: kind of like chaos theory
 Wontonimo: There was a paper (I'll post it if I find it again) in which it compared the effectiveness of a completely random multi layer Dense NN with a final linear regression layer vs a traditional multi layer Dense NN that used backprop for training
 Wontonimo:   The conclusion was that with a wide enough random DNN + just linear regression you can achieve state-of-the-art (circa 2016 ish when the paper came out)
 sprkrd: Wontonimo The Extreme Learning Machine's paper?
 Wontonimo: and the followup statement that if the wide random DNN is just a random feature generator, then with enough random features then linear regression is enough
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_learning_machine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_learning_machine</a>
 sprkrd: I studied that method way back when i was doing the master's
 sprkrd: There's quite a bit of controversy around it (assuming it's the one you mean)
 Wontonimo: nice quick link.  Thanks.  That may be it
 Wontonimo: I remember a key point being that it needs to be very wide to be effective
 sprkrd: maybe it's not the one you meant, the paper is from before 2016 (although you said circa)
 Wontonimo: 2016 ish
 sprkrd: the controversy is due to a plagiarism matter,, not about its effectiveness 
 Wontonimo: oh, plagiarism.  tisk tisk on them
 sprkrd: and well, at the end of the day random weights for the first layer are an interesting idea and may give you ok results sometimes for the classical datasets, but i wouldn't bet in it taking us too far
 sprkrd: the authors say they didn't plagiarize anything, and blah blah blah. I'd say it's probably a case in which they didn't have any idea of previous similar methods or didn't care enough to see the connection.
 Wontonimo: let's say your hardware was such that you couldn't really update the weights, but you could have 100x as many (but random) than some other hardware.
 Wontonimo: if you could make each of your layers 100x as wide, then you'll cover probably all the meaningful combinations of weights
 Wontonimo: now take a look at photonic interference NNs, whereby the convolution is performed by interference pattern of light scattering from one printed filter to another
 Wontonimo: anyway, i digress.  my original point was with enough random features you can reduce the problem to a linear regression
 sprkrd: Just to know that we're on the same page: are we talking about the same thing? A hidden layer connected with random weights to the input followed by an output layer with weights tuned via linear regression on the random features of the hidden layer?
 Wontonimo: I'm expanding it to multiple layers
 sprkrd: I don't know... I wouldn't bet on it working for segmenting 1024x768 images, for instance
 Wontonimo: and since I can't find the original source, I can't say if multiple layers was in there.
 sprkrd: In ELM I think they do shallow networks with just one hidden layer, but maybe you had in mind a different paper that expanded on this premise
 Wontonimo: Here is a related paper (not the one I was thinking of which focused on DNN) that address your image question <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.13299.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.13299.pdf</a>
 Wontonimo: it states that a large random RESNET-50 image network has highly effective subnetworks in it that perform as well as RESNET-34
 Wontonimo: now i'm on a quest to find that original paper&#160;!  :D
 sprkrd: yeah... it's a bold claim, but the work seems highly exploratory
 sprkrd: they achieve good results in CIFAR10, and say that the results are not so good on ImageNet (although they find a "promising trend")
 sprkrd: the problem is that CIFAR10 is a kid's problem, so to speak, for classifying images into 10 categories
 sprkrd: It's not segmentation really
 sprkrd: anyway, the claim is interesting, and I don't mean to contradict it, but it seems to me that there's a long road ahead and I don't quite see it as a promising direction
 jacek: wide enough layer, like n-tuple?
 jacek: and why RoboStac is resubmiting oware bot? :scream:
 RoboStac: testing caching nn lookups
 jacek: oh my
 RoboStac: gives much better performance later on, but slightly worse on early turns
 jacek: the pair thing?
 RoboStac: no, just having a hashtable for gamestate -&gt; nn results 
 jacek: ahh this. its just TT for NN
 RoboStac: yeah
 RoboStac: makes a massive difference on C$
 jacek: no transpositions in oware until the end
 RoboStac: but I oware states don't transpose as often
 RoboStac: they transpose a lot more than I was expecting though 
 jacek: more transpositions in breakthrough or checkers
 Myrky: Hello
 Myrky: A little question guys
 Myrky: If I try to do a puzzle in JS/TS there is a method named readline()
 Myrky: But I cannot run that method in a browser
 Myrky: As in, copy the code locally and try it on my IDE
 jacek: in console?
 jacek: readline() reads from input. its how it get data for puzzle. in C it would be i.e. scanf
 RoboStac: yeah, I believe js doesn't have a synchronous one by default so CG add one to make the code simpler.  I think there are implementations on the forum you can add to run locally
 Myrky: aha... oh well, then I will just code a solve() function in my IDE and use unit tests without invoving the console
 jacek: or instead of x = readline() do x = "test case input"
 Wontonimo: +1 for simplicity
 sprkrd: you know... for these things I've always thought that Javascript is kind of a lousy language for anything not-web related
 jacek: and web-related as well :v
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 sprkrd: jacek I didn't want to be harsh and come to that, but I'm glad you did :D
 struct: robo destroyed me&#160;:(
 RoboStac: sorry&#160;:(
 struct: its fine :p
 RoboStac: just need to find a way past smits now
 struct: I dont understand why my bot struggles so mnuch vs you
 struct: much*
 Myrky: @jacek well, I could do that, but then I wouldn`t have a suite of unit tests for easy testing, much faster than on an IDE
 Astrobytes: AllYourTrees: Liking the 'cold war' we have going on in BT :D
 AllYourTrees: haha yeah slowly but surely
 AllYourTrees: you are almost in the 20s nice!
 Astrobytes: Indeed. I'm trying to squeeze as much as I can before I implement some other bits and pieces.
 AllYourTrees: nice, whats your approach?
 Astrobytes: my usual alphabeta
 AllYourTrees: oooooh nice, did you come up with a custom eval fn?
 Astrobytes: Yep. That's what I'm tweaking 
 AllYourTrees: cool!!
 Astrobytes: Once I fixed that silly bug the other day it gave me a chance to play around a bit. 
 AllYourTrees: what was the bug??
 Astrobytes: I can't remember lol, something in the movegen, was doing some invalid moves
 struct: still need to start bt
 AllYourTrees: ohhh ya i remember now
 struct: my goal is to beat robo
 Astrobytes: It was a really easy fix too
 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Where is he wrecking you struct? C4 I presume?
 struct: yes
 struct: but im done with c4
 struct: im not gonna waste time on it
 Astrobytes: "I'm done with &lt;insert multi&gt;" yeah, yeah :D
 struct: its not healthy to stare at leaderboard
 Astrobytes: That is true.
 struct: at least I still have the rank 1 screenshot :D
 Astrobytes: Stare at the code instead. Usually more productive
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Marchete: :eyes::bar_chart:
 Astrobytes: hey Marchete, your Oware AZ tech.io article is excellent, thanks
 Marchete: and at least I have 1 peer review, jolindie_n was able to reach top 5 with it
 struct: After I finish reading the book ill read your article
 struct: otherwise Ill probably wont understand it
 Marchete: My article is TLDR
 Astrobytes: oh wow, so he did
 Astrobytes: struct, actually I'd recommend it now
 Marchete: no complex formulas or thoerical stuff
 Astrobytes: Well, it's light on the matter, but explains the processes well
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: glad you liked
 struct: but i still dont understand how NNs work
 struct: so i might need to read the book fits
 struct: first*
 Marchete: NN is a function approximation to me
 Astrobytes: ^
 Marchete: at least how do I use it
 jacek: isnt it what is it
 jacek: NN for me is extended eval with much more tweakable params to tune
 jacek: while in classical eval you could tune by hand or semi automatic, in NN you need (almost?) exclusively use gradient descent based on data
 Marchete: yea
 struct: but I still dont understand the layers part well
 jacek: and meh, when you two fight with me in bt, i lose points :c
 Marchete: like a massive coeff paramtuning
 Astrobytes: still sounds like function approximation :D
 AllYourTrees: NN is just matrix multiplications
 struct: anyways my eta for NN is 2025 so plenty of time
 Astrobytes: 2025 NN or delete eh
 AllYourTrees: M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G
 Marchete: 2025 will be anything else
 Marchete: 2021 is NN year
 RoboStac: surely he'll have deleted for some other reason by then?
 Astrobytes: Possibly robo :D
 struct:&#160;:(
 Marchete: are you improving your NN even more, RoboStac?
 RoboStac: maybe
 RoboStac: I made it worse first
 RoboStac: but I think it's now at least as good
 AllYourTrees: Marchete have you tried your implementation on C4?
 Marchete: that'd be my next multi
 Marchete: but as I have a baseline
 Marchete: I want to explore all ideas before moving to C4
 AllYourTrees: gotcha
 struct: if you need help with the sim feel free to ask
 Wontonimo: (raises hand)
 struct: I might even share with you how i update the moves&#160;;)
 AllYourTrees: :O
 Marchete: I was thinking about reusing either pons's code, or fhourstones88, to be true
 Marchete: update is adding a bit, isn't it?
 Marchete: but I need to reuse NN between states, maybe
 AllYourTrees: you need a small NNUE
 Marchete: it seems updateable at first layer
 Marchete: yes
 jacek: both you and jolindien use C# :thinking:
 struct: its a wrapper isnt it?
 Marchete: he posted a comment on tech.io
 Marchete: so I assume he used it
 RoboStac: yeah, he's said in chat he used it
 AllYourTrees: i love it when i introduce a bug and get 3 million rollouts
 jacek: i think struct meant if c# was wrapper for c++
 struct: maybe I have the same bug AllYourTrees
 jacek: c# being 3rd in leaderboard, noice
 Marchete: it's a wrapper, yes
 AllYourTrees: lol your magical code is a mystery to me struct
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/ENCODER16k.cs">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/ENCODER16k.cs</a>
 struct: if you think on how you can update moves without clearing and setting a bit it makes sense
 AllYourTrees: ohhh
 jacek: by... xoring!
 Marchete: board |= move?
 AllYourTrees: i think i just added that to my BT bot actually
 AllYourTrees: board has 2 bits set and xor like jacek said?
 AllYourTrees: well idk if you need two for c4
 struct: no
 jacek: dunno i never saw his code
 struct: also i dont need ctz to get the bitindex this way
 struct: i guess ill just share it
 struct: since im done with c4
 AllYourTrees: will you regret this tomorrow lol
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/RoboStac">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/RoboStac</a>
 struct: ok then maybe i wont
 struct: :p
 Marchete: seems better...
 jacek: :F
 RoboStac: it should be slightly better, it's the same but generally faster as far as I can tell  (first turn gets less nodes created as it has the least transposition, but after that it gets better)
 jacek: maybe it handles loppy endgames better
 RoboStac: yeah, the endgame stats look much better
 struct: your c4 also seems better now
 struct: at least if i make my ai play worse I no longer win
 RoboStac: c4 I'm actually still training
 struct: :scream:
 RoboStac: oware I'm just porting improvements from c4
 struct: so the c4 is the same ai?
 RoboStac: I had a slow nncache on C4 before as when I was trying convolution it helped a lot, but I made it much better and it's now fast enough to be useful on oware too
 AllYourTrees: whats your nn structure robo?
 RoboStac: but I did forget that gamestates aren't unique per player on oware
 Astrobytes: Oh good job on Oware robo
 RoboStac: which is why it looked to help so much but made it play worse originally
 RoboStac: AllYourTrees on c4 or oware?
 AllYourTrees: c4!
 jacek: :bomb:
 RoboStac: 63x3 inputs -&gt; 256 -&gt; 9/1 outputs
 jacek: one hots are hot topic now
 RoboStac: I'd always have one hotted c4
 Marchete: 9/1 means you get 10 and then you do something to split, or there are 2 outputs?
 Smelty: yes
 AllYourTrees: interesting ty!
 Marchete: I've tried 9+1 and "separate" in loss function
 Marchete: didn't get any better
 Marchete: well, 6+1
 RoboStac: yeah, 10 outputs from the same dense layer with softmax on 0-8 and tanh on 9
 darkhorse64: how do you choose size and number of hidden layers&#160;? Guess work&#160;? Voodoo&#160;?
 Marchete: I was unable to do it
 Marchete: voodoo mainly
 RoboStac: in training they're separate networks ( 256 -&gt; 1 and 256 -&gt; 9 ), I just combine the weights afterwards
 Marchete: ahhh
 RoboStac: darkhorse64 - yeah, pretty much. 
 AllYourTrees: 256 is divisble by 4 so amenable to simd at least
 AllYourTrees: #math
 RoboStac: yeah, everything has to be divisible by 8
 RoboStac: or it gets messy
 Marchete: AVX2 -&gt; 8 floats
 AllYourTrees: :facepalm:
 AllYourTrees: yeah i *totally* knew that
 AllYourTrees: &gt;.&gt;
 RoboStac: my 10 output layer is technically doing 16 values
 RoboStac: I just pretend they're not there
 AllYourTrees: oh seriously? is that that much of a speed up?
 Marchete: sometimes up to 6x
 jacek: impossibru
 Marchete: you can code "normally" and sometimes the compiler optimizes it
 BlaiseEbuth: Nani?!
 AllYourTrees: holy cow
 jacek: you killed the chat eh
 AllYourTrees: rip indeed
 Marchete: :skull_crossbones:
 Astrobytes: I just wasn't in chat, nothing to do with AllYourConversations here
 AllYourTrees: AllYourWords
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: RoboStac if your NN caching only helps in late game. Just generate an endgame book
 MSmits: takes 500 ms to get a 9 seed one
 Illedan: Where is the fun in that?
 MSmits: it's fun for me :P
 Illedan: :D
 RoboStac: caching pretty much helps all the time, it just gets better endgame
 MSmits: ahh ok
 RoboStac: plus if I use 500ms then I definitely lose a lot of turn 1 sims
 RoboStac: but yeah, it'd probably be a better idea
 RoboStac: though less useful for other games
 MSmits: for bandas it's awesome 
 MSmits: better than oware
 MSmits: ah but nvm, it's hardcoded in bandas
 MSmits: takes too long to generate
 RoboStac: I've got a lot of spare bandas codespace
 MSmits: you need your codesize
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: then its possible, i need only like 25 kb
 MSmits: for a size 12 endgame book
 MSmits: (3x4, 4x3 etc.)
 RoboStac: it's  seems to be a game where the eval doesn't need a massive network and performance matters
 MSmits: i wouldnt know
 MSmits: but i get now why the caching helps
 MSmits: it doesnt help for me in any games, because my evals are fast
 MSmits: but if you are bottlenecking hard on eval, it does make sense
 Marchete: caching is probably game agnostic too
 Marchete: so less time for implementing it
 RoboStac: yeah, my oware one should be (just have to write a == and a hash function for each game)
 RoboStac: my c4 one wasn't because I forgot the turn / player are encoded in the gamestate there
 Marchete: but your nncache is simply a hash check?
 MSmits: what do you mean encoded in the gamestate?
 RoboStac: as in you can never have the same state with different players to move
 MSmits: thats true i guess
 RoboStac: in oware you can
 MSmits: after turn 1 
 MSmits: (when steal has happened or not)
 MSmits: yeah you can, except turn 1, which is only ever one side
 MSmits: also if a side doesnt have an empty pit, it cant be p2
 MSmits: i mean it cant be the player not to move
 MSmits: actually around 20% or so "possible" states in oware arent possible because neither player has empty pits
 MSmits: i tried to get this fact into my endgame book to make it more compact, but it was too hard to turn it into an index function
 MSmits: so i just have dead spots in the book that are never used. Pretty common to endgame books
 AllYourTrees: Marchete do you have new MCTS per turn, or MCTS per game in your CGzero?
 MSmits: do you mean if he reuses tree?
 MSmits: also are you asking during training or in the actual CG games?
 AllYourTrees: yeah
 AllYourTrees: training
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: oh wait, do you mean a single tree for both players?
 MSmits: like, a single process playing itself with 1 tree?
 MSmits: I do this in meta mcts
 AllYourTrees: i guess theres a couple ways it could be.1. new MCTS instance per turn2. MCTS instace per player that is reused on each turn3. one MCTS instance for both players that is reused on each turn
 MSmits: i see no reason to use 1 over 2, unless you like the simplicity of it
 MSmits: it shouldnt matter that much
 MSmits: 3 is a different thing though, it's more efficient, but it could maybe have side effects
 AllYourTrees: :shrug: 1. cause thats what the pseudocode for AZ did
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L1865">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L1865</a>
 Marchete: I changed it to use it in selfplay too
 Marchete: too complicated
 Marchete: maybe I'd go the simple way
 Marchete: big array and when it's almost full, reset it
 MSmits: do you reuse?
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: but do both players use the same tree in training?
 Marchete: no
 MSmits: thats a different way to reuse
 MSmits: if it's selfplay, it might not matter
 Marchete: selfplay players aren't the same sometimes
 MSmits: it does matter if you are pitting different versions
 MSmits: ah right
 AllYourTrees: i have same version so it wouldn't matter for me i guess
 MSmits: It always worked ok for me, to do it this way
 MSmits: it saves me from having two processes both using a huge chunk of memory and waiting on eachother
 AllYourTrees: i can't think if there'd be any bad side effects? like if you have a single tree then both players can look further, which means policy is more accurate?
 AllYourTrees: search policy*
 MSmits: yeah I cant see any either, but maybe there are
 RoboStac: there some exploration differences as the AZ noise is only added to the root 
 Marchete: that's true
 AllYourTrees: hmmm ya
 MSmits: what would that do though?
 RoboStac: but it does work fine 
 Marchete: add noisy noise
 AllYourTrees: previous searches may influence current search maybe?
 MSmits: thats always the case with reuse
 MSmits: the reuse is just stronger
 RoboStac: if you have too many mcts iterations it can cause the noise to be entirely irrelevant because the nodes have so many visits 
 Marchete: it's true, I forgot the dirichlet noise...
 MSmits: ahh right, but thats a problem with reuse in general
 RoboStac: yeah
 MSmits: you want to control the number of iterations, then you cant reuse
 MSmits: or i guess, at least you have to stop at 200 or whatever
 MSmits: so if it already has 100 visits, you stop at another 100 that urn
 MSmits: turn
 RoboStac: yeah, theres some debate about whether it should do x extra iterations or stop once the root has x visits
 AllYourTrees: robo have a link? would be curious to read further
 MSmits: x visits makes more sense to me
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero/issues/1156">https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero/issues/1156</a>
 MSmits: it should not matter in which turn the visits were obtained
 MSmits: this doesnt affect the tree
 AllYourTrees: ty
 RoboStac: except we're back to the noise being on the root so you are lowering exploration 
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: well then thats just another thing to experiment with&#160;:)
 RoboStac: yep
 Marchete: I added the tree reuse on selfplay
 Marchete: but I'm in doubt now
 Marchete: I think I may add some noise on the function too
 Marchete: tree reuse function*
 MSmits: I think the benefit or damage to your bot by making one choice or other in this is too small to properly research
 Marchete: only game diversity
 MSmits: some things just only matter a little
 Marchete: so many little things
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: and don't start with the damn cpuct
 AllYourTrees: lol
 Marchete: a constant that isn't a constant
 AllYourTrees: ikr, i still have mine as a constant
 Marchete: based of on smth?
 Marchete: or just guessed?
 AllYourTrees: the az c4 article
 MSmits: well... I don't think you have to do everything the same as the actual azero algorithm
 MSmits: maybe other things work better in CG constraints
 Marchete: I was using leela chess zero as some reference too
 RoboStac: yeah, the leela calculation is much more complicated
 Marchete: i've seen documents with cpuct 3, 4, 2,1, 0.5
 Marchete: I mean any possible number
 RoboStac: yeah, not helped by people having different ranges for the output value
 Marchete: yes, the 0..1 range in AZ
 RoboStac: but thats no different to standard mcts articles I guess
 Marchete: true
 <b>**dbdr celebrates getting back the #1</b></p><p><img src="/a/61997162908277" /> Marchete: congrats
 Marchete: where?
 RoboStac: asteroids?
 Astrobytes: oh nice
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://planetoids21.kattis.com/standings">https://planetoids21.kattis.com/standings</a>
 Marchete: CoC?
 dbdr: yeah
 RoboStac: nice
 Astrobytes: oh you're also 1st on CG now too, I have been away too long indeed
 Marchete: yes, good job
 dbdr: I lost the lead by 50 points, now I took a lead of 4K. still too much time left
 Astrobytes: Much more significant lead than earlier on asteroids
 Marchete: how's the planetoid game?
 MSmits: huh wow dbdr, how did you get 1st on CG
 MSmits: i didn't know you were that close
 dbdr: probably the smart thing now would be to sleep&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: How long you got tomorrow?
 dbdr: until 9pm CEST
 Astrobytes: (in terms of your available time I mean)
 dbdr: planetoid is underspecified, so it's partly reverse. and usual optim
 dbdr: I'll make time&#160;:)
 Marchete: you played with advantage on this, a seasoned optim+multi player
 Marchete:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hehehe, in that case, sleep sounds good but you know you're gonna try a few things beforehand :D
 dbdr: yeah, but I guess i'm not the only one. not sure about that crowd
 dbdr: NinjaDoggy  is there
 MSmits: don't let him ninja your swag bag
 Astrobytes: I'd be expecting late submits
 dbdr: I just did try a few thing, and eventually one was fruitful&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: In that case then sleep while the going is good :D
 dbdr: the seeds are secret though, so late submits might be risky
 RoboStac: is there any point to late submits as you can't see what others are doing / have no idea what the validators are&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 Astrobytes: I didn't realise that, my bad
 dbdr: I guess only a psychological point
 dbdr: let others think they are safe
 MSmits: and then nab the swag bag
 dbdr: you're obsessed about the sawg :D
 MSmits: I know :P
 dbdr: I'm more interested about going to Moscow&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Smits is a burglar by night and teacher by day
 Marchete: I hope you win dbdr, you are the master on optims
 MSmits: yup
 Astrobytes: Yeah, hold on to that lead man
 dbdr: thanks!
 MSmits: oh thanks again dbdr
 MSmits: 28th -26th from that bug you spotted
 dbdr: calm?
 MSmits: yea
 dbdr: cool!
 MSmits: i mean from the cp
 MSmits: it was the C# update
 MSmits: no more mono trick
 Marchete: no mono trick for codegolf
 MSmits: no it was that think where you restarted main with some arg
 Marchete: or what trick do you mean?
 MSmits: or something
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: that crashed my bot and i was 167th legend
 MSmits: now 37th or so
 Marchete: I think they added release mode
 MSmits: yeah so i hear. I didnt realize what that would do to my bot
 MSmits: i dont much code C# these days, just some local windows forms stuff
 struct: my c4 bot is dead&#160;:(
 struct: time to move on
 BlaiseEbuth: All dead. All dead. All the dreams we had...
 Marchete: RIP
 Astrobytes: Rust In Peace
 ja_fica: jacek, you there?
 ja_fica: or robostac
 RoboStac: hi
 ja_fica: Hi, you use NN in C4?
 RoboStac: yes
 ja_fica: You train it with regular DRL or data generated from MCTS
 ja_fica: Im trying to do a c++ convoluiton neural network, but Im having trouble to generate good data to fit in the first place
 RoboStac: it's alphazero based, so does self play with a fixed number of mcts runs per turn and trains a value against the gameresult / and a policy against the vistis
 RoboStac: I also gave up on convolution as I wasn't getting good results
 ja_fica: you output the action or the evaluation ou both?
 ja_fica: *or
 ja_fica: Thats odd, conv patterns seems a good fit for C4
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://adspassets.blob.core.windows.net/website/content/alpha_go_zero_cheat_sheet.png">https://adspassets.blob.core.windows.net/website/content/alpha_go_zero_cheat_sheet.png</a>
 RoboStac: conv was fine except the performance is so low that it keeps falling into traps
 RoboStac: it's a good fit for the connecting 4 part but struggles with the endgame movecount part i think 
 RoboStac: as a pattern that gives you an easy connect 4 can be entirely broken by one extra piece on the opposite side of the board changing where moves are forced
 ja_fica: You train it in c++?
 RoboStac: the actual training is python based, but generating training data is c++
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://tech.io/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a> &lt;-- article by marchete who has a similar setup
 ja_fica: thanks
 ja_fica: you use the prediction multiple times or just 1 per turn?
 RoboStac: multiple times - think of it as mcts but the rollout is replaced with a NN evaluation
 Hudie: :expressionless:
 ja_fica: I'm going to try it
 ja_fica: I have already succesefully created the matrix multiplication with bias and relu
 ja_fica: in c++, just not the training, thats a little too complicated for me, specially with otpimizers
 ja_fica: With NN it seems too costly, how many rollouts can you do?
 ja_fica: It defnitly works doe
 RoboStac: I get about 20-25k nn evaluations per turn. It's costly but as it guides the tree search / is a more accurate value it ends up working
 RoboStac: my conv network was less than 5k evaluations
 RoboStac: which I think was the main problem
 Wontonimo: ja_fica are you going to use a lib like pytorch or tensorflow for training?
 Wontonimo: wow, how are you possibly doing C4 without conv?  That's amazing
 ja_fica: i was going to use keras
 Wontonimo: that must take an insane number of training steps
 ja_fica: 126 inputs is enought
 ja_fica: yes conv look like faster
 ja_fica: ate least in training
 ja_fica: *at
 RoboStac: it's up to 800k games played and still seems to be improving, not sure if that counts as insane or not&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: and do you save those games or just generate a new one every time?
 RoboStac: it does a batch of 4000 games, then trains on the data. Keeps a history of the last 10 million samples (game turns) to train from
 Wontonimo: Here is a training schedule called "The biggest loser".  I'd be super interested in how it improves / hinders your NN
 Wontonimo: the idea is to only train on the worst 10% (or 20% whatever) of a batch.  so if your training batch is 1000, then check them all for error, and only actually use the worst 100 for training
 Wontonimo: How hard would it be for you to try that out RoboStac?
 Wontonimo: The huge benefit this algo has is that from my experience it helps train the network much faster, like 2 to 10 times faster,
 Wontonimo: and it catches outlier cases a lot better, and doesn't spend most of it's training on things it already knows well
 RoboStac: depends if I need to find the worst 10% of the whole history or just the 10% of the samples to train on (I take many sets of 2048 samples from my history for training)
 Wontonimo: just from the sample.
 Wontonimo: do you use tensorflow?
 RoboStac: yeah
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56e1f785-8c0a-4d3c-a637-93fb2fe9ad20">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56e1f785-8c0a-4d3c-a637-93fb2fe9ad20</a>
 Wontonimo: where k is the number of samples.  If your batch is 2048, then a k of 512 would be 1/4th
 Wontonimo: no other change to your architecture is needed
 RoboStac: I'll have a play with it when I get bored of this current C4 training
 RoboStac: need to get the final 0.02 trueskill to get past smits 
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: if you do, Please let me know how it goes.  Congrats on getting so so very close&#160;!
 RoboStac: I'm 99% sure I could just resubmit and be top, but going to leave it running overnight to see if it improves further
 Wontonimo: i suspect he is beating you on those edge case, which I think worst_k loss function will help you with
 Wontonimo: *finish him*  lol
 Wontonimo: I don't know what your loss function is, but if it isn't categorical_crossentropy, then just replace the categorical_crossentropy part of worst_k
 RoboStac: yeah, it's a bit more complicated as it's two outputs (value/policy) but shouldn't be a difficult change
 Wontonimo: if you are using a dual head network, you can specify a loss function per head like so
 Wontonimo: model.compile(optimizer="adam",
 Wontonimo: if not, then it isn't as straight forward
 Hudie: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/18386440f701e6505ee26c193f42b3f6c7f5de3">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/18386440f701e6505ee26c193f42b3f6c7f5de3</a>
 Hudie: come on baby
 Wontonimo: nice job at getting to First RoboStac
 Wontonimo: that is no small lead
 Wontonimo: ja_fica, what's your architecture for C4&#160;?  You are climbing
 ja_fica: very smart rollouts
 ja_fica: each rollouts average +32 plays
 ja_fica: I choose to back 1 before in case of a play that is a lose
 ja_fica: Also AVX helps
 ja_fica: helps arround 55% more visits
 ja_fica: Ofc, if the rollouts are too smart, I will have too low rollouts, so I set as an hyperparmeter how much to go back
 ja_fica: I choose 3 for the current sumbition
 struct: I pushed robo
 struct: Now I cant lose many points vs him
 struct: :D
 ja_fica: good thinking&#160;:)
 struct: Wontonimo if you want to do connect 4
 struct: feel free to ask for help
 struct: ok found a better version
 struct: now im fully done with c4
 struct: time to do breathrough
 Wontonimo: Thanks struct, I appreciate the offer and will probably take you up on it later
 struct: np
 struct: im not the rank 1 bot but I can still give a few tips
 struct: but grats to robo for making a great bot
 Wontonimo: your bot is VERY impressive
 struct: thanks
 Wontonimo: ja_fica what do you mean "I choose to back 1 before"&#160;?
 ja_fica: I have a function that predicts the places where I can put a piece without directly losing
 ja_fica: so I test my possibilities to see if any the current move leads to it
 ja_fica: If it does, then the enemy can win
 Wontonimo: I've heard a couple people saying that smart rollouts work well for this, which is very different than UTTT
 ja_fica: so I roll back a play
 ja_fica: yes it is
 ja_fica: UTTT probably benifits a way more from neural networks
 Wontonimo: are you almost doing a minimax for every move?
 Wontonimo: when doing 3 for example
 ja_fica: MCTS solver is based in minimax
 ja_fica: It sure backs my algorithm
 ja_fica: solver &gt; non-solver 
 struct: solver seems like always an improvement
 struct: it was on uttt
 Wontonimo: the question was more about your rollout, and the rollback of 1 or 3.
 struct: I dont rollback at all, he does
 ja_fica: rollout 3
 ja_fica: *rollback 3
 ja_fica: Its a tradeoff, the smarter the rollouts, the less I have
 Wontonimo: for sure
 struct: early game seems important
 Wontonimo: late game too lol
 ja_fica: this smart rollouts help in the first moves
 struct: dont think so
 struct: sometimes I solve 30+ moves before game is over
 ja_fica: solver helps mid-game
 Wontonimo: wow, yeah makes sense
 struct: this happens if most of the moves are forced moves
 struct: it doesnt happen everytime
 struct: sometimes is hard to solve
 Wontonimo: it's game over once MTCS solver finds the move
 struct: yeap
 struct: at least now i have someone to put up a fight against me on contest
 struct: :D
 struct: from my country I mean
 ja_fica: yes, I will be there&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: ᕦ(ຈل͜ຈ)ᕤ
 ja_fica: I didn't know how cool contests were before
 ja_fica: Now I am CG addicted
 struct: I wonder if next will also be a board game
 struct: I hope its something fresh
 Wontonimo: cheers to that
 struct: Is not that I dislike board games, but there is so much that can be done
 struct: ok i kinda dislike board games, but not all of them
 ja_fica: board game are way too deterministic
 ja_fica: ate least the turn-based full-state
 struct: well that happens more on games that always have same starting state
 struct: This is why when I ported amazons
 Wontonimo: i see you've been on the platform for a few years ja_fica
 struct: I made the positions random
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/amazons/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/amazons/leaderboard</a>
 struct: I still have to make a bot for it
 struct: if you check the replays you will see that the positions are random
 ja_fica: When I started CG I just played Clashs, I did get to rank 6
 Wontonimo: haha, make a multi but don't make a bot
 struct: But with a few conditions
 struct: Wontonimo I ported 4 games
 struct: I dont have a bot for any of them
 ja_fica: sounds interesting
 struct: jacek has a bot that beats his current bot by 90%+ win rate
 Wontonimo: I was thinking it would be a good candidate for CNN eval
 ja_fica: C4 looks perfect for CNN eval
 ja_fica: the problem is the slow prediction phase
 struct: The problem that the random has is that I dont know if positions are balanced
 struct: but 2 games are played from each position so it makes it fair
 ja_fica: as every thing random, with enough games it should go upwards the balance
 struct: you play one game as white and one as red
 struct: black*
 cognivore: is there a filter to never play shortest code challenges? they yield bad habits and are unwinnable in rust or any other language where tthere are a lot of ceremonies.
 struct: no cognivore, its only available on private clashes
 Wontonimo: but we just don't get that many games ( ͡ಠ ʖ̯ ͡ಠ)
 struct: What do you mean Wontonimo?
 cognivore: well, I guess I'll play everything as a speed clash haha and skip shortest code ones
 struct: cognivore submit always 1 char on shortest
 struct: you wont lose as many points
 cognivore: @struct, I don't understand
 struct: if people get 0%
 cognivore: There's ELO? :thinking:
 struct: you will place above tem
 struct: them*
 struct: yes
 struct: But dont care much about it
 cognivore: Gah, I was so happy that I started winning :D 
 cognivore: But I guess it just placed me into the abyss
 struct: its not really elo
 struct: you get matched vs any player
 Wontonimo: i like that Amazons is 2 games in a row to make it fair.  The alternative of just running lots of games to make up for the randomness with the 2 game mirror is just out of our hands and not good cost/benefit anyway
 struct: its not elo based matchmaking
 struct: true, i stole it from re curse chess
 Wontonimo: oh man, the 1 char submit is so evil.  i've never done that
 ja_fica: get 100% on shortest mode
 ja_fica: its still training
 struct: that also works
 ja_fica: And many shorstest are not finished
 struct: but if he just wants to skip it he should submit 1 char
 ja_fica: just playit like a fastest
 ja_fica: yes
 Wontonimo: good night, i'm falling asleep on the keyboard
 struct: gn wontonimo

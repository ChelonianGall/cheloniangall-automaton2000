 InCog: can anyone help me with my code?
 MSmits: Try 1234, best start in bulls and cows
 davilla: what language?
 InCog: js
 InCog: I am not sure whether rounding negative values in js has any unforseen effects
 InCog: like whether it rounds off wrongly
 MSmits: do you mean unforeseen negative effects?
 davilla: should round to nearest int by IEEE standards
 InCog: guess you could say that MSmits
 MSmits: it's easy to test
 MSmits: do some error output in the puzzle
 MSmits: for rounding -1,5 and + 1,5
 MSmits: see what it does
 MSmits: then you can stop worrying
 davilla: at exactly the halfway point, it's supposed to round to the even number
 MSmits: so also test 2.5 and -2.5
 MSmits: just make 4 error statements that print these numbers rounded 
 davilla: so -1.5 and -2.5 should both go to 2
 davilla: =2
 davilla: -2 bleh
 InCog: aight
 derjack: good morning
 derjack: ive been pushed in uttt i thought after your resubmit ill go down
 derjack: oware is also interesting
 derjack: somehow after retraining from scratch again i am better but i losing more to agade
 YurkovAS: in oware you use bytes board int8_t boards[2][6] or uint64_t boards[2]&#160;? 
 ErrorRazor: Looks like 999 frames is the maximum in the sponsored contest... o.O
 derjack: board[12]
 derjack: well houses[12]
 YurkovAS: maybe uint64_t is faster
 derjack: only smits is crazy enough to use bitboard for that
 derjack: but &gt;90% time is spent on eval so i dont care that much anyway
 YurkovAS: do plan to make NN for csb?
 YurkovAS: top1 of 100k users&#160;:)
 derjack: not in nearest future yet
 derjack: i need to fix my.sim
 someone-owo: mhm
 jrke: an highly optimized sim + good evaluation system + bug free game engine can easily give you top 50 in lengend in CSB
 magaiti: yep, just 3 extremely hard to achieve things and you are golden

 InCog: the nintendo one?
 AntiSquid: codingame sponsored something lol
 AntiSquid: :D
 InCog: or the backtracking one
 AntiSquid: check optimization section aCat
 AntiSquid: it's in there
 aCat: aah its optim
 aCat: thanks AntiSquid
 aCat: :kissing_cat:
 AntiSquid: don't, no kisses no hugs, just social distancing is fine @_@ i'll wear my :mask: for once
 aCat: cat's do not transfer the virus
 aCat: we can hug freely :P
 AntiSquid: it's not about the virus
 AntiSquid: which has 99.74% recovery rate
 AntiSquid: it's about being a bit too close @_@

 Sparow: Hi everyone, someone can suggest me an IDE for C or C++
 Sparow:&#160;?$
 AntiSquid: visual studio code
 Sparow: VS code doesn't work, even thought I use code runner
 Sparow: And i've already check the PATH
 AntiSquid: that's on you
 AntiSquid: works wonders for me, either you fix your setup or you wait/look for a suggestion
 AntiSquid: did you use visual studio then?
 Sparow: I only use VS code to edit but I can't build
 AntiSquid: there is visual studio and visual studio code
 AntiSquid: try to see if the other one works 
 Sparow: ah ok thx
 origami091: umm

 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 sonic1991: thanks
 Enwynn: Does anyone know what to work on if you want to solve the problems more effienctly if you are using Java&#160;:)?
 BlaiseEbuth: Learn c++
 darkhorse64: faster&#160;? better algorithms&#160;?
 Enwynn: Maybe like streams or other tools im missing out on are important in these problems. Im just using  things I learnt at college.
 Enwynn: I know C++ should I use that language instead? Im completely new to this.
 AntiSquid: yes use what's best for you
 AntiSquid: don't play clash, there are better ways to spend time
 sonic1991: I think C++ is the most efficient for most time, but thats not the only argument to be led by
 sonic1991: pyhton is less efficient but it less code
 AntiSquid: you only need less code in clash
 sonic1991: Sometimes its about time
 sonic1991: but yeah mostly less code
 AntiSquid: you can prototype in python
 sonic1991: I lose with pythons always
 BleedingTime: Take that back, Python is my baby
 Enwynn: :thumbsup:
 BlaiseEbuth: Your baby is ugly.
 AntiSquid: you don't look anything like Guido, BleedingTime

 AntiSquid: english or nobody will understand you
 eulerscheZahl: "rum" is English, isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: also: i hate that Automaton bot, one day i'll just ban it
 orangesnowfox: lol, euler
 AntiSquid: the line before that @_@
 jacek: about rust? :f
 AntiSquid: also rum is same word in many languages i am sure
 AntiSquid: even AutomatonNN has better reading comprehension than you folks
 AutomatonNN: hey hi all :D
 AntiSquid: see?
 jacek: meow
 orangesnowfox: Okay, so clearly dfs isn't the best way to go about 2048... (only reaching depth 8 :v)
 eulerscheZahl: read the tags, they might contain a hint
 orangesnowfox: beam search, yeah, just never used it before
 eulerscheZahl: 2048 is a great place to start
 orangesnowfox: good to note, really weird that my dfs with depth 8 and "using up the extra moves" is enough to get rank 80 or so though
 jacek: dfs? like minimax here?
 orangesnowfox: ... Minus the mini part?
 jacek: oh right
 jacek: welp the main issue here was number of moves vs quality per turn
 jacek: you get only 50ms (or less, due to buggy optim timeouts)
 jacek: so is it better to have 30 moves with 1ms search, or 10 moves with 3ms search
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, `-LRURDURURUUURUUUUUUUULULULLDLRRDLULDUDDLUUURRURLURDDURRRLDLLL` I have moves in spades though (that was the last turn)
 orangesnowfox: The answer is probably "try to exactly use up all your moves"
 jacek: and rust is 1st :unamused:
 orangesnowfox: Hey, jacek
 orangesnowfox: Want to get more upset?
 orangesnowfox: Look at rank 82 :p
 jacek: :scream:
 AntiSquid: why? rank 81 is also rust and better
 orangesnowfox: lol
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid, I'll beat rank 81 in less than 24h I promise :p
 AntiSquid: look there is a D on 57
 orangesnowfox: Look there's a python on 31
 jacek: and php at 45. probably hardcoded
 AntiSquid: you can hardcode in 2048&#160;??
 orangesnowfox: jacek: doubt, one of the validators is random, and there's like 30
 orangesnowfox: Huh... AntiSquid: Actually yes. Didn't think about that
 orangesnowfox: Only one of the validators *is* random
 AntiSquid: you don't have the validators
 jacek: you know the seed and rng
 jacek: validators are named after seed
 AntiSquid: oh ok
 jacek: unles euler is a troll
 orangesnowfox: eulerscheZahl: are you a troll?
 jacek: so its deterministic
 orangesnowfox: yeah
 AntiSquid: you can make the script fail on specific seed so easy to verify
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: yeah, but who is going to submit for *every* validator to check that? lol
 eulerscheZahl: orangesnowfox 08:11PMeulerscheZahl: are you a troll?
 AntiSquid: well if you hardcode you will do it 1 by 1 so ...
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: if you hardcode you're going to do all of them offline by writing a program that exhaustive searches up to some insane depth picking each move as you go through that
 eulerscheZahl: testcases are the same as the validators btw
 orangesnowfox: ye, figured
 eulerscheZahl: minus the random one
 orangesnowfox: well, it's the same, just... Random
 eulerscheZahl: CG shows the wrong titles on submit
 AntiSquid: so&#160;? orangesnowfoxthat doesn't change what i saidyou have to check seed to make sure you give correct hardcoded output
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: true, I suppose
 AntiSquid: lol
 orangesnowfox: Except euler already confirmed the seeds are the same (which means as long as your generation program isn't buggy it works, so you don't have to test them individually)
 jacek: do you believe that troll
 orangesnowfox: ... lol

 WKDE: Hi folks, have a somewhat strange issue. I started doing Bender Episode 1 (to get to the next level) and succeeding all 12 test cases in IDE. When submitting i reach only 91% since only the 1st (and easiest) TC fails. Any idea how to understand what's going on?  Thx
 orangesnowfox: eulerscheZahl: it fits the rest of the names changing ;p
 eulerscheZahl: other changes= did you get married?
 orangesnowfox: ... No, I uhh, changed my first middle and last name. I'd rather not go into more detail than that
 eulerscheZahl: you started that topic&#160;;)
 orangesnowfox: mm, yes, suffice it to say, the name I was given 19 years ago isn't a name I like now
 jacek: WKDE validators are different than testcases
 jacek: it means your solution isnt general enough or fails on some edge cases
 eulerscheZahl: I hope witness protection allowed you to go back to CG
 orangesnowfox: ... hahaha, not witness protection, although maybe I should let people believe that 
 WKDE: sure, it's just odd that the simplest validator fails whereas all others are fine&#160;:-/
 eulerscheZahl: hard to tell without code
 eulerscheZahl: you could try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4</a>at least you get visual feedback there :P

 kovi: last week i think, i have noticed postion change after talking with msmits
 WKDE: i think i found a hint in the forum ,  ( #@$#  case )
 AntiSquid: hey euler, about that, was intended to ask you if you intentionally added specific patterns, my solution isn't great btw
 AntiSquid: intending *
 eulerscheZahl: all validators are generated
 eulerscheZahl: build random mazerandomly place fields and switches
 AntiSquid: so everything is a coincidence?
 AntiSquid: ok
 eulerscheZahl: then remove a few walls, place some garbage balls
 eulerscheZahl: run BFS solver to check if there is a solution but &gt; 100 steps
 AntiSquid: ah i found a stupid simple approach lol ... garbage balls are bonus added on top and my shortener for output isn't best approach, dbdr can go lower i think
 eulerscheZahl: i have a pattern in that? interesting, wasn't aware. it might be that some switches are useless if that's what you mean.
 AntiSquid: a general pattern in all maps
 AntiSquid: i mean it's same kinda detail 
 eulerscheZahl: hm, and i let the generator run for almost an hour to find these maps&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: so there's the pattern detail + one other trick i noticed for pathfinding
 AntiSquid: and then for shortening i have a somewhat cheap approach
 Wontonimo: ah, just tuned my 2048 heuristic and moved from 59 to 44th place.  Nice bump for a little work.  No hardcoded anything.
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what you are talking about
 eulerscheZahl: congrats Wontonimo
 AntiSquid: have no idea what i talk about?
 eulerscheZahl: yes AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: or wonto&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: race condition
 AntiSquid: regarding the pathfinding trick&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Wontonimo: sorry for the totally off topic comment ... looks like my chat window was frozen on previous 2048 talk ...
 AntiSquid: i realized how to quickly find a path without all the complicated details i discussed with mcsmitz
 eulerscheZahl: intended solution is a BFS with 3 dimensions (x,y,switch state)
 Wontonimo: let's see what we are talking about now
 AntiSquid: for bender 4 you inded a solution with 3 dimensions? you can do it with 2
 AntiSquid: intended *
 AntiSquid: but maybe one can find better paths with 3D i guess&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no other tricks like nested BFS or combining x+y to 1 dimension?
 eulerscheZahl: then i'm clueless
 eulerscheZahl: i can prove that mine is the shortest path (ignoring compression and garbage balls)
 eulerscheZahl: 4886 steps on submit
 stingalleman: hi
 AntiSquid: i don't completely ignore garbage balls
 eulerscheZahl: i only move at most 1 to reduce branching
 AntiSquid: euler i am not sure what you mean by nested bfs
 eulerscheZahl: the mess that smits described
 AntiSquid: ah lol
 eulerscheZahl: totally over-engineered :D
 Astrobytes: A 'nested bfs'?
 eulerscheZahl: marco BFS how to go from 1 switch to another
 eulerscheZahl: and BFS for switch order within the single steps in between
 Astrobytes: Intriguing
 AntiSquid: is a bfs for each state over-engineering too&#160;? 
 orangesnowfox: is my obsession with bitvecs for boolean arrays over-engineering?
 AntiSquid: btw you can run bfs once . and yes use x and y as one dimension each .  then the magic sauce
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, i'm way too tired tbh
 Astrobytes: Bitwise is life orangesnowfox
 orangesnowfox: lol
 Astrobytes: hi everyone btw
 AntiSquid: what bitvecs are you using orange&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: btw: don't forget about hashcode next weekend
 kovi:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: hi Astrobytes
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: 2048, `merged` bitvec
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still not used to your new avatar
 therealbeef: Uhh: Best score
 Astrobytes: It's almost identical! Switched a ducky to a musical keyboard lol
 AntiSquid: do you mean bitset orangesnowfox
 orangesnowfox: yes, sorry orz
 eulerscheZahl: somehow the color brightness just doesn't match
 kovi: i hardly recognize my bender code
 orangesnowfox: I also use them in the fall 2020 challenge for recipe exhaustiveness, ocean of code for maps, etc etc
 Astrobytes: Blame Scarfield
 AntiSquid: ok i use bitsets too for convinience, some people keep saying uint is faster for use, but then others say compilers these days are very smart so it doesn't matter, so i stick to bitset
 kovi: but it looks similar to msmits ideas
 kovi: i was afraid from the dimensions of one single bfs
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: sometimes I'm using the bitsets for memory usage and cache efficency tbh
 Astrobytes: Never compared performance of the two tbh AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: how many bfs do you run kovi
 AntiSquid: for bender
 AntiSquid: and is it 3D&#160;??
 AntiSquid: just curious
 AntiSquid: didn't think of 3D approach lol
 kovi: seems messy. i calc a few dfs
 kovi: bfs
 Astrobytes: I think I would condense that to 2D (1D indices)
 kovi: and than try to chain them together
 kovi: with some dependency...and again bfs
 kovi: it can also handles pushes
 Ahmanny: hello
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/penguins">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/penguins</a> Ahmet_Sahin make a submit here! fun bot programming
 dirty_code: hello, what is your favorite bot programming game in compete section?
 AntiSquid: hi dirty_code, it's this one&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a>
 ErrorRazor: Shameless.
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 AntiSquid: how so ErrorRazor&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid, I like it too, it's the only one I wrote a postmortem for
 AntiSquid: thx
 orangesnowfox: But my bot sucks xd
 ErrorRazor: AntiSquid you made it?
 Astrobytes: A bot that sucks is better than no bot at all.
 ErrorRazor: Or part of it
 jacek: no
 jacek: who advertises their game anyway
 Astrobytes: Not you jacek. Definitely not you.
 AntiSquid: i asked a question first ErrorRazor
 ErrorRazor: Indeed
 jacek: eeyup*
 AntiSquid: so you should have the decency to at least first submit a bot there before continuing this conversation
 AntiSquid: submitting *
 AntiSquid: nvm that sentence is still messed up, just like my code
 AntiSquid: but submit a bot anyway
 ErrorRazor: Fine
 Astrobytes: Chill Winstons

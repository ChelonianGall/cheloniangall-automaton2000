 ProCoder3: Can someone help me with Crystal rush , I am confused about how to make it dig 
 ProCoder3: can anyone give a gist of idea on how to do it 
 ProCoder3:&#160;???
 ProCoder3: thanks
 AntiSquid: see statement
 AntiSquid: just dig 
 AntiSquid: DIG 
 ProCoder3: Thanks @AntiSquad
 Andriamanitra: anyone got some pro tips for debugging "unfolding paper" puzzle
 Andriamanitra: all the simple test cases i can think of pass but i have some bugs in the big ones
 Andriamanitra: ah, found it
 Gargaz: How do I figure out why my syntax is invalid
 Andriamanitra: depending on the language the error messages may be helpful
 Gargaz: It's python
 Gargaz: Psuedo code algorithm gives very vague help
 Andriamanitra: are you getting any error message, maybe a line number?
 Gargaz: SyntaxError: invalid syntaxat Answer.py. not in a function on line 24
 Andriamanitra: did you try to do something that you can only do inside a function?
 Andriamanitra: or maybe you forgot a colon somewhere?
 Gargaz: Not sure, first two levels was easy enough to just edit the values in the code now I have to do a function I have no idea on how to do
 bigfatnoob: guys how dou you increase thrust on coders strike back
 Gargaz: edit the value
 bigfatnoob: how
 Gargaz: by changing it from 50 to 100
 Gargaz: in the code 
 Gargaz: So... now I got the working if statement I think, but the "end if" satement returns a syntax error invalid syntax
 Andriamanitra: there is no end if in python
 jacek: python is eternal
 Andriamanitra: you should probably look up some beginner guide on python and go through the first section to get a feel for the syntax.. it's all indentation based, no "end"s or "}"s
 Gargaz: Fair enough, I did however think this was for beginners
 Andriamanitra: well, yes, but you need to know some basics
 Gargaz: Got an error now on a line I dont have
 Gargaz: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsingat Answer.py. not in a function on line 28
 Gargaz: My code has 26 lines
 bigfatnoob: it just instantly ends as soon as i press start
 George012GR: hey how do i learn c#
 MSmits: many ways to do that. I learned it while scripting and modding for space engineers (a game)
 Community-Bot: hii everyone

 Rouli: can anyone help me with this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b09d28a6-e8cc-44b5-a0ce-1aed6dbc0f4b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b09d28a6-e8cc-44b5-a0ce-1aed6dbc0f4b</a>
 Andriamanitra: looks like you're off to a good start, although the indentation is giving me nightmares
 Andriamanitra: you'll need to handle the edge case where there's negative and positive temperature equally close to zero though
 MSmits: nightmare on indentation street
 Rouli: so you mean adding if statement like this ( if t&gt;=0 and t&lt;0) , right?
 Rouli: Indentation because there's a loop code above :sweat_smile:
 bigfatnoob: i cant do this bronze league level what is the code for it
 AntiSquid: "this" 
 AntiSquid: which game&#160;?
 Rouli: analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.
 Community-Bot: who nice game 
 bigfatnoob: coders strike back
 AntiSquid: -3 velocity
 Community-Bot: u can't borrow code from other hiledhuwsj
 AntiSquid: you can add -3*velocity
 bigfatnoob: but it like just ends intantly
 AntiSquid: hiledhuwsj it only gets harder not easier
 AntiSquid: that means you have a bug&#160;! fix the bug
 bigfatnoob: how
 AntiSquid: by reading the code&#160;? undoing the bugs you added&#160;?
 bigfatnoob: i reset the code
 AntiSquid: or go to HISTORY and look at your previous submit and start over from there
 Andriamanitra: @Rouli "t&gt;=0 and t&lt;0" is always false, t can't be both greater than or equal to zero and less than zero at the same time!
 jacek: whats Community-Bot? :o o: :o

 GiorgosGiorgakis: why cant I progress in coders strike back
 AntiSquid: rank too low or submit isn't finished
 GiorgosGiorgakis: why does this always evaluates to true if( (done == 0) &amp;&amp; (nextCheckpointDist == maxdist) &amp;&amp; (runs&gt;3) ){

 Codin.Gamer: hii everyone whatsup
 GiorgosGiorgakis: I beat the boss in coders strike back back I cant advance the leagues
 mARIO-san: figured it out. It didnt like that i was printing chars but he expected a single string
 AntiSquid: GiorgosGiorgakis and you have a complete submit&#160;?
 GiorgosGiorgakis: yes that was the problem
 GiorgosGiorgakis: now im rank 1 itll probably advance now
 GiorgosGiorgakis: I have only the button test in arena
 GiorgosGiorgakis: nah still wood
 GiorgosGiorgakis: :D
 AntiSquid: did you just resubmit&#160;?
 GiorgosGiorgakis: I only have the button TEST IN ARENA
 AntiSquid: so the answer is yes
 GiorgosGiorgakis: yes I pressed it again :o
 AntiSquid: and then you complain you can't advance :D
 GiorgosGiorgakis: does it advance on it's own?
 GiorgosGiorgakis: I went to rank 1 but it didnt advance
 AntiSquid: in the IDE click leaderboard and read text at the top
 AntiSquid: or maybe it doesn't show anymore when you get promoted, anyway you need a complete submit 
 GiorgosGiorgakis: so submit = test in arena button
 AntiSquid: you should see something like "those better than the boss will be promoted at ..."
 AntiSquid: and that only happens at 100% submit, so just wait&#160;?
 GiorgosGiorgakis: ok it advanced now
 GiorgosGiorgakis: i have a laggy laptop

 Kitkat260: yes
 Kitkat260: clash of code
 jacek: is it :notebook: :soccer:
 Kitkat260: @jacek hi
 jacek: good afternoon, Sir/Madam
 Wontonimo: Kitkat260 I'm tired of CoC.  If you want to take a look at some of the practice or compete items, I'd be happy to help if you get stuck on one
 Kitkat260: ok
 Kitkat260: @and i'm a gal
 Wontonimo: In practice, the easy puzzles will take a lot longer than the CoC.  CoC is designed to be about a max of 15 min per puzzle.  The easy puzzles will take you a lot longer each.  If you find CoC challenging, then they could take a few hours each.
 Kitkat260: ok

 MSmits: sorry to hear that
 Kitkat260: and.....
 MSmits: thats it
 Kitkat260: ok
 Kitkat260: can u join soo i can get help
 MSmits: sorry, i dont clash
 Wontonimo: i've been meaning to pick up a chromebook for a while... the thought of portability, chrominess,  and then I remember I don't leave my desk ever
 AntiSquid: that's why we don't have clash links here, not everyone enjoys clash but some people will spam the link until others join (never)
 Wontonimo: i mean, why do i even work on a laptop when I sit here for 14 hours a day?
 MSmits: i dont like the idea of only being dependend on chrome addons
 MSmits: dependent
 MSmits: also its bad for your back/neck to stare downwards for hours

 AntiSquid: didn't sleep enough i think
 RAWAN_REDDY: can some1 help me with binary problem
 Wontonimo: link?
 RAWAN_REDDY: to find if a number has zeroes in bin representation
 RAWAN_REDDY: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1609038cbbb8d37da0ef9342295307e35da02b1">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1609038cbbb8d37da0ef9342295307e35da02b1</a>
 MSmits: problem = 1.   problem ^= 1     -&gt; problem = 0
 RAWAN_REDDY: how do i share the problem here
 DJSchaffner: check if the number &amp; however many bits you have set to one equals to zero or not
 Kitkat260: ok @wontonimo
 RAWAN_REDDY: some help me understand this pls
 AntiSquid: you should do coc on your own
 Wontonimo: it looks like it is complete and done.
 RAWAN_REDDY: its over just trying to understand others solution
 AntiSquid: screenshot the statement i guess&#160;?
 RAWAN_REDDY: print(str(-~a&amp;a==0).lower())
 RAWAN_REDDY: what does this do
 struct: a = 5
 struct: str(6&amp;5==0)
 struct: .lower()
 RAWAN_REDDY: ok i see &amp; work bit wise
 RAWAN_REDDY: what is this '-~'
 struct: -~5 = 6
 struct: ~-5 = 4
 struct: it increases number by one
 RAWAN_REDDY: ` reverses
 RAWAN_REDDY: - is subtraction 
 RAWAN_REDDY: meaning
 AntiSquid: is it this&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-tilde-operator-in-Python">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-tilde-operator-in-Python</a>
 RAWAN_REDDY: i got reverses
 RAWAN_REDDY: ok thank you guys
 RAWAN_REDDY: gr8 got it
 DJSchaffner: oh wow i was wondering if i was blind but the font here just seems to mess up the tilde for me 
 RAWAN_REDDY: yea it does
 RAWAN_REDDY: i was think the same
 AntiSquid: you need large screen, works fine for me :P
 RAWAN_REDDY: lol
 AntiSquid: had same issue on smaller screens
 struct: nah
 struct: its font related
 AntiSquid: oh ok
 Wontonimo: For example&gt;&gt;&gt; [ -~x&amp;x for x in range(10) ][0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 8, 8]
 Wontonimo: (oh, sorry, coversation moved on)
 AntiSquid: why the .lower()&#160;?
 RAWAN_REDDY: actually i still didnt get it
 RAWAN_REDDY: lower is part of question dont worry about it
 Wontonimo: i think the answer needed "true" or "false" , but [ -~x&amp;x==0 for x in range(10) ][True, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, False]returns camel case
 AntiSquid: ah ok just checked
 Kitkat260: /me
 AntiSquid: RAWAN_REDDY check the link i shared earlier
 Wontonimo: i'll have to remember "-~x" for golf
 RAWAN_REDDY: yeah am trying to figure compliment
 Kitkat260: is anyone lonely or is it just me
 AntiSquid: look up bit representation then i guess
 RAWAN_REDDY: yea at it rn
 DJSchaffner: why not use +1 / -1 though? first time i see this and trying to understand the reason. the order of execution should even be the same and its more clear what it does
 Wontonimo: that's code golf for you.  readability isn't the point
 DJSchaffner: yeah but a+1 is the same length as -~a
 AntiSquid: less magical
 DJSchaffner: i mean if it did actually shorten the statement i would understand
 Wontonimo: your words are true, both of you
 RoboStac: there are cases where operator precedence makes -~ shorter (eg doubling x+1 needs (x+1)*2 as opposed to -~x*2) so maybe whoever it was just always does -~x to increment
 RAWAN_REDDY: wow
 RAWAN_REDDY: nice
 RAWAN_REDDY: thanks
 Wontonimo: don't put that in any real code, just saying.   golf only
 baguettes: UBODMAS or UPEMDAS for programming&#160;;)
 baguettes: U for unary
 Grizzlyslayer: sup ppl
 struct: it is interesting how it works
 struct: ~5 flips the bits and becomes -6
 struct: -  -6 becomes 6
 Andriamanitra: how do you even write javascript with a broken numpad if you're not allowed to do -~-~-~-~-~null
 Andriamanitra: it's also nice because you don't need to remember what the numbers look like you can just type -~ every time you want one more
 Kitkat260: anyone good at history
 Wontonimo: MSmits that refactoring was a pain.  Now just double check nothing broke (no change in sim/sec yet), and now it's time to refactor for static allocation of nodes.
 jacek: you use nodes pool now?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am thinking of making a mcts playground on tech.io.  I have implemented it on ordinary tic tac toe with simple to read code
 UnnamedCodinGamer: does that make any sense?
 MSmits: yeah it can be a lot of work to refactor an 1k line bot
 MSmits: try a 2k line bot, even worse :P
 jacek: plot twist: 2k line python bot
 MSmits: ugh
 MSmits: I can imagine that
 MSmits: line 663.... now was this an integer or a float&#160;?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: The idea is to test and play around with the algorithm
 MSmits: who renamed automaton?
 MSmits: oh i missed your earlier message
 MSmits: seemed out of the blue
 MSmits: sure, mcts playground is good, but i think it exists already
 UnnamedCodinGamer: does it?
 MSmits: i think euler wrote one? Or someone else
 MSmits: yeah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I did not find it on tech.io
 struct: its just a code snippet
 struct: not a playground
 Valdez001: good morning
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: hi
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, I have seen it and could not make much sense of it
 MSmits: well you can always make a better one UnnamedCodinGamer
 MSmits: it would nice to have
 MSmits: be
 jacek: nice to be?
 struct: nice to have be
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I recently managed to implement mcts and to get it to work as expected
 MSmits: it would be nice to have :P
 UnnamedCodinGamer: then I returned to a previous attempt where I tried it with tic tac toe
 UnnamedCodinGamer: now it works 
 struct: Add solver to it&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and just wanted to share it, so that others have an example 
 Astrobytes: Seems like a good idea. A lot of people ask about it here in chat
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think just reading from different sources it can be confusing
 UnnamedCodinGamer: for me it was
 Astrobytes: It's easier for us to give help in optimising it if people already understand the algo.
 Astrobytes: And yes, I was the same initially.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, definately
 MSmits: very true
 Astrobytes: Is there an article on MCTS solver? Did jacek cover that in his one?
 N-ONE: how to study for college and improve yourself in the field&#160;?anyone knows how&#160;? i am sick of college stuff 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: there are articles 
 jacek: i didnt do anything for solver
 jacek: and a paper
 Astrobytes: oh it was meta MCTS
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know there are papers, I meant on tech.io
 jacek: jacekmax has implied solver
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but they did not give you the implementation details
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think where I was wrong was for instance how to treat end game nodes
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit, bbl
 UnnamedCodinGamer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/2oI54uz">https://tech.io/snippet/2oI54uz</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: is this understandable enough?
 struct: A bit different from my code
 struct: I dont store state
 struct: or uct value on nodes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, it is something like proof of concept code
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it can be optimized a lot
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the idea is to see how it works
 UnnamedCodinGamer: to check node visit counts 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: play with the number of iterations
 CMIKAIL: (__)
 Kitkat260: hi
 Jaminima: bonjour
 Wontonimo: jacek "you use nodes pool now?" Just implemented it minutes ago.  No performance change yet&#160;:(
 jacek: should be easier to reuse tree now
 Wontonimo: true, and I'm excited to implement the tree reuse... just a little sad that after all that refactoring and memory savings, the benefits were eaten up with board calculations
 Wontonimo: ah, all my hyperparameters were tuned for the old architecture ... gotta retune
 jacek: *5 years later*

 jacek: teach us sensei
 Wontonimo: reCurse words of wisdom for sure
 Wontonimo: also, i'm looking forward to porting the tree reuse and solver from my c++ to my gMCTS npm package once it's done an proves itself
 jacek: gMCTS?

 brandonFaf: If there was a coding problem that i didn't get to finish and i wanted to keep trying it locally, is there a way to find the prompt/tests to do that? 
 jacek: sounds like js
 Wontonimo: brandonFaf not something that is directly supported within CG.  
 reCurse: Isn't there a euler tool for that
 Wontonimo: if you know the name of the clash, you can look it up with the tool
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 brandonFaf: dang i didn't think to look at the name, i just have the id of the clash. Thats still helpful though. Thanks
 Astrobytes: you can search by keywords you remember from the description of the problem too
 Toby75: A question - why does my RegEx in JS apply to all occurences in a string, even though it ist not using a global flag??
 Toby75: I tested it on another ide and it worked perfectly
 Wontonimo: show code of each test plz
 Toby75: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/873805aa9f16bc6eb2a53fdd8753ad5e22c8ca">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/873805aa9f16bc6eb2a53fdd8753ad5e22c8ca</a>
 Toby75: Code ist here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/NFHtbnN1">https://pastebin.com/NFHtbnN1</a>
 Toby75: please just lmk if someone knows why it replaces every single zero even though there is no global flag
 Wontonimo: the pastebin link is blocked for me for security reasons

 jacek: maybe they are protecting you from js insanity
 reCurse: Well you ask it to match between 1 and 3 zeros greedily
 Toby75: i have really no idea, regex ist confusing me again
 reCurse: Do you have a specific test case
 Toby75: reCurse yeah - but it should replace the first one to three zeros in a block
 Toby75: it even replaces the zeros that are in the center of the block
 Toby75: but normaly it should not do that - it ist not using a global flag for the expression
 reCurse: But you loop over the blocks? I don't get it
 Toby75: I loop over every block, and the purpose of the regex ist to replace the first one to three zeros
 Toby75: but if the block does not start with a zero, it should do nothing
 reCurse: Yeah but you didn't tell it that
 reCurse: You just said match any sequence of 1 to 3 zeros greedily
 reCurse: Well, the first one it finds
 reCurse: But you did not specify start of string
 Toby75: no - then I would need /g at the end
 reCurse: Sorry I worded badly
 reCurse: It matches the first sequence of 1 to 3 zeros greedily
 reCurse: But you didn't say start of string
 Toby75: yeah starting from the begining of the string
 reCurse: So it will pick the first one it finds anywhere in the string from the start
 reCurse: You didn't specify start of string, again
 reCurse: That would be /^[0]{1,3}/
 Toby75: I thought it always starts at the begining of the string when there ist no /g flag
 reCurse: Use regex101.com to help
 reCurse: No, g flag only means it will match many times
 reCurse: Means nothing about start of string, that's what ^ is for
 Toby75: aight thank you
 reCurse:&#160;:+1:
 Toby75: still kinda weird because it used to work on my local node
 Toby75: so i thought it had a problem with node version or something like that
 Wontonimo: regex is super powerful and available in lots of programming languages!  I think it is under appreciated.  For sure any skill you gain with it will help you in other langs
 reCurse: *visible restraint*
 Wontonimo: come on reCurse ... i wanna hear it
 reCurse: Nah don't get me started
 reCurse: Have a meeting soon anyway
 Wontonimo: IM TRYING&#160;!

 BlaiseEbuth: Hey there! I've a contribution in validation since some time, and considering the amount of pending CoC, and the propensity of a lot of people (including me) to flee away from this section of the site, I fear my poor puzzle could wait for a long time to be validated...

 BlaiseEbuth: I'm against people who does not read puzzle's statement and wonder why their code does not pass the tests. This puzzle is designed to make them suffer.
 jacek: anticeg puzzle?
 Wontonimo: haha.  Also, it's classified as hard, so I personally think having a long problem statement is okay.  time reading it vs time solving the problem isn't out of proportion 
 Jstn123: hi
 Tusuke: a
 Aidanr: im new to coding so im not quite good anyone explain to me?
 Wontonimo: first two bits&#160;?
 Dom9543: line of code
 Aidanr: im tryna kill all the enemies in c# but i can't figure out how to kill them all?
 jrke: Aidanr which game?
 Aidanr: Onboarding ye
 jrke: thats tutorial
 Aidanr: ik im new
 jrke: just print position of nearest enemy from you
 Wontonimo: restart it and read the help text,  it's very helpful
 Aidanr: im doing c# it wants me to shoot them all i think
 Aidanr: ok thanks
 jacek: once per loop
 Wontonimo: don't over think it
 Aidanr: ok thank you
 Wontonimo: Dom9543 i'm guessing you just started ultimate tic tac toe, or is it another puzzle?
 jacek: another uttt victim
 Dom9543: no i quited that one
 Dom9543: im solving a new one
 jrke: which one?
 Wontonimo: winners never quit, and quitters never win, but those who never quit and never win are idiots
 Dom9543: no i dont need help thank you
 Wontonimo: right now i'm in the idiot camp of uttt it seems
 kovi: you won!
 kovi: (tomino)
 kovi: tonimo sorry
 jacek: :drum:
 Dom9543: when i have more knowlage of AI coding i will come back to that
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: i like it!
 Jstn123: me too
 Wontonimo: the MCTS solver looks really straight forward.  Am i missing something?  It's almost obvious (in hindsight o/c). Did anyone run into a gotcha while implementing it?
 jacek: it is straightforward. just the paper is rather messy
 jacek: maybe draws can be tricky
 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 Notgoodatcoding5: How is everyone?
 JohnathanBarbee: I'm in the process of trying to implement it now to my bot in UTTT. I'm trying to roll my own method without copy-pasting and I've been debugging for about a week and a half now.
 jacek: new craze for uttt eh
 JohnathanBarbee: I found it about a month ago and it's pretty fun
 Wontonimo: are you writing unit tests JohnathanBarbee&#160;?
 JohnathanBarbee: I'm going through each section and unit testing now. Right now I have a huge bug where the solver takes more than 81 turns and still, doesn't have a game fully played. I'm trying to figure out how that's possible
 Wontonimo: i've got about x2 the number of lines of unit tests than actual uttt code
 JohnathanBarbee: I bet so. I wish we had breakpoints so I could analyze each step in the loop
 Wontonimo: oh, what?  how is the solver anything other than no turns?
 Wontonimo: what does your solver do?
 JohnathanBarbee: I think it's either incorrectly labeling moves or repeating moves. Not sure which one
 Wontonimo: is your solver doing minimax or something?  my plan is to just use mcts with infinities in nodes 
 JohnathanBarbee: I did have my own custom method to break into Gold. Now I'm rewriting everything to use MCTS.
 JohnathanBarbee: First time using MCTS and first time using BitVector32 in C#, so I knew it was an uphill battle at first.
 Wontonimo: ah.  Similar, I started with python and a custom MCTS-ish-thing to get to silver, then rewrote 
 Wontonimo: have you profiled/instrumented your code locally?
 JohnathanBarbee: No. I don't want to have to write a test environment, but I thought about doing it one weekend
 Wontonimo: no test environment needed! (well not much anyway).  For instrumentation I hardcoded the first move to -1 -1 and set the time allowed to 10 seconds then quit after.  During that time, i open up instrumentation and BAMB! you get a fabulous breakdown of where you are spending cpu time
 jacek: i.e. for calculating log for every children
 Wontonimo: yeah, i was calculating log for every child (but I missed that one and had to be told)
 Kitkat260: suup
 Astrobytes: Could you possibly expand your vocabulary from variations of 'sup' and 'hi'
 JohnathanBarbee: You've convinced me to test locally. I guess I know what I'm doing tonight!
 jacek: eeyup
 struct: Aye
 Kitkat260: hi Johnathan 
 JohnathanBarbee: Hey
 Kitkat260: hru
 Astrobytes: Sometimes I really hate this webchat, laters
 Kitkat260: why
 Wontonimo: good luck JohnathanBarbee, let me know how it goes
 Kitkat260: Does anyone want to be friends with me?
 jacek: friendship is magic
 Kitkat260: how
 Wontonimo: JohnathanBarbee here's my python test harness code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gist.github.com/panchishin/14fd14e57b517528fbc4a52f1167d2de">https://gist.github.com/panchishin/14fd14e57b517528fbc4a52f1167d2de</a>
 Wontonimo: I reused by uttt code to make a "check_winner" which uses all the same logic but instead of outputting a move, it outputs "WINNER IS 1" or 2, or "UNDECIDED"
 tridvajedan: should i switch from java to pythom
 tridvajedan: n*
 struct: or you can use brutal tester
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 struct: depends on what you are trying to do
 Wontonimo: oh, if only i knew of that 2 weeks ago
 struct: you can still use I guess
 struct: you can even run multiple games at once
 Wontonimo: don't use mine, use brutaltester.  Just read through it, it's way better.
 Hamgi: how are you guys doiiiiing&#160;!!!!!
 Kitkat260: hi!!!!
 Kitkat260: hru
 Hamgi: good just listening to some deep house music
 Kitkat260: nice
 jacek: deep learning house music?
 Hamgi: no just normal deep house

 Kitkat260: @Hamgi want to be friends?
 Hamgi: sure why not
 Kitkat260: nice
 Kitkat260: check ur msg
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: Ôo
 Kitkat260: really
 Wontonimo: Poll time - which bot battle did you have the most fun with (I'm looking for a recommendation for my March focus)?Tron Battle , Spring Challenge 2020 , Great Escape , Poker Chip Race , These ones are nos
 jacek: breakthrough&#160;:?
 Kitkat260: goood night
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ghost in the Cell
 Wontonimo: i thought breakthrough was coming ... yeah, i love the simplicity of the rules
 struct: CSB
 jacek: yinsh :v
 Wontonimo: did you enjoy CSB more than other games struct&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct didn't say yinsh, lol
 Astrobytes: never mind that, jacek didn't say paper soccer
 jacek: rock football
 struct: I enjoyed it, also you can learn some new stuff on it
 struct: I learned avx by trying it on CSB
 Astrobytes: scissor snooker
 struct: I never recommend Yinsh
 Wontonimo: good point 
 struct: PCR is fun, but is harder imo
 struct: to create a decent sim
 struct: or you can try FB
 struct: which is the best multi here
 Astrobytes: Is that official?&#160;:)
 struct: Fantastic Bits
 struct: imo its the best
 struct: Dont think we will ever see another physics contest
 Astrobytes: Maybe not even another contest as we know them . . . 
 jacek: phew
 PatrickMcGinnisII: FB is good for method overloading, polymorphism ... which is still a difficult concept for me
 Astrobytes: Such a C programmer :P
 jacek: no polymorphism in php?
 Wontonimo: not just regular morphism, poly-morphin
 Astrobytes: He's a Mighty Poly-Morphism Stranger
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there are ways, but inline defs aren't really a php thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: stranger ... tx god I'm not a BDSM ranger
 Astrobytes: Heh heh!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tron is easy to get legend in, but watching GitC games makes it the most fun for me
 Jstn123: hi
 Wontonimo: i have yet seen a legit good use of polymorphism other than as an example of what not to do
 Astrobytes: Most of the games are fun tbh, it's worth just going through them and seeing what sticks
 Astrobytes: As it's highly subjective as to which is best/most fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Yinsh kills my brain on so many levels
 Wontonimo: oh ... sorry ... i don't know why i was thinking multiple inheritance ... totally different rant.  poly your morphs all you want
 Astrobytes: something something deadly diamonds
 Wontonimo: maybe daydrinking is not for me
 Astrobytes: Your pished?
 Astrobytes: *You're
 Wontonimo: if i was, at least i'd have an excuse for mixing oo terms i use on the daily for 20 years.  sigh... hands type faster than the brain somethings
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: We're only human
 PatrickMcGinnisII: COIF may be good for day drinking
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: i'm a bit tired of CSB.  I started on CG without really knowing how hardcore you people get on some games and didn't bother coding locally for the first couple months.  So, although I never wrote anything serious for CSB, it feels tired to me.  but you make a good point struct
 Astrobytes: It's one of those things you go back to, imo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth is PCR?
 Astrobytes: Poker Chip Race
 MSmits: Wontonimo, you say "you guys" but the people who get "hardcore" on games are a very small subset
 MSmits: they're just overrepresented on worldchat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh yes, I didn't enjoy PCR
 Astrobytes: 5% some say...
 MSmits: I did, besides the extreme amount of coding of the sim
 MSmits: if the game was easier to sim, it would be better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smitsimax bloomed on CSB i believe
 MSmits: also PCR
 MSmits: out of top 4, 3 are smitsimax
 MSmits: including nr 1 i think
 Wontonimo: hey, MSmits, have you heard of smitsimax?  
 MSmits: yes
 Wontonimo: hahaha
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 MSmits: i wish i thought of a more descriptive name though :P
 MSmits: I was just trying to be funny during the contest where i first used the algo
 Wontonimo: too late
 MSmits: yup
 Astrobytes: was that Kutulu?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: man, that seems like decades ago
 MSmits: it does
 Astrobytes: It's that CG time dilation again
 MSmits: I have mixed feelings though. I liked the contests, but they were also very stressful for me, i preferred the downtime between contests actually
 MSmits: then i could take my time with some multi
 Astrobytes: That's simply because you can't resist going all-in
 MSmits: correct
 Wontonimo: This one coming will be my virgin contest event.  i booked time off work and everything
 Wontonimo: don't let me down
 MSmits: thats what i did
 MSmits: made sure all my work was done as far as that was possible
 MSmits: sometimes it jusr wasnt, especially when the contest happened during exam week
 MSmits: that ice and fire contest, i only coded half the week and promoted legend at the end of sunday, midnight, 10 hrs before end of contest
 Astrobytes: I suppose it's easier to take time of now it's only 2 per year, whether it's worth it now remains to be seen
 MSmits: my submit went all the way to rank 17... never been happier in a contest
 Astrobytes: *off
 MSmits: well i cant actually take time off, its more shifting work around
 Astrobytes: Sure you did something similar in another contest too
 MSmits: i cant shift it for more than a week or 2, so it doesnt matter for me
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: ooc
 MSmits: i was bored with the contest, went away for weeks
 MSmits: then had a sprint in final weekend
 Astrobytes: Right enough
 MSmits: i think i was somewhere top 40
 Astrobytes: It was long though, a month?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: with locam i took it much more seriously
 MSmits: went all in for 4 weeks, but after 2 weeks i did not get much improvement
 MSmits: even kept coding on vacation, trying things
 Astrobytes: yeah, in the hotel lobby or something iirc
 MSmits: under the blankets, hotel room dark except for that light spot in the middle, me and my laptop operating cg bench
 MSmits: that too
 Astrobytes: lol, under the blankets like a child reading books by torchlight
 MSmits: exactly
 Astrobytes: I was one of those kids lol
 Wontonimo: so ... Tron is easy to get legend.  CSB is different (read NNs).  Fantastic Bits is where to find them.  PRC is hard but fun.
 MSmits: last time i was on vacation i was obsessed with othello, the one before that i was doing puzzles to learn python, seems i am always coding
 MSmits: Wontonimo please help me reach legend with tron :P
 MSmits: still havent
 Astrobytes: Hence the CS training&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: re. seems i am always coding
 MSmits: yeah
 Wontonimo: MSmits that's back to the metagame challenge&#160;: play in a league for the purpose of promoting others and making sure you dont
 MSmits: ah right
 Astrobytes: I might need to find a new career myself, the pharma regulatory is not good for me here now
 darkhorse64: MSmits: Tron legend is 80 lines of Python
 MSmits: how so
 Wontonimo: i kinda would like to be able to revert back to previous leagues if i choose too
 MSmits: yeah i think i did something wrong darkhorse64
 struct: FB legend is &lt;100 lines of code
 Astrobytes: PI businesses are having to move to EU to get anything done
 MSmits: i have a 14 depth minimax
 MSmits: still gold
 darkhorse64: I have a depth 1
 MSmits: Astrobytes that sucks
 Astrobytes: Brexit for ya
 MSmits: ah yea
 darkhorse64: FB legend under 100 LOC&#160;! Wow&#160;! Only ifs. I got gold with ifs and switch to GA
 Astrobytes: Time to learn a framework and get a job as a code monkey
 MSmits: maybe struct codes really long lines
 Wontonimo: and golfs them
 struct: let me check
 darkhorse64: with UTF16
 Astrobytes: 2000 line bot in 100 lines of japanese chars
 Astrobytes: *symbols
 MSmits: mmmh how would that work
 MSmits: dont they  only go in strings?
 struct: ok its 120 lines
 Astrobytes: don't be so literal
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: with 6? ifs?
 MSmits: yes literals
 MSmits: thats what i meant
 MSmits: :P
 Wontonimo:&#160;:)
 MSmits: struct, why do you need 120 lines for 6 ifs
 MSmits: 100 lines of comment?
 struct: reading inputs
 Wontonimo: he didn't want loops
 MSmits: ah
 struct: also I calculate distance
 struct: and some other stuff
 Astrobytes: Legend with that? Nice. I know it's doable without sim + search but that's impressive.
 MSmits: velocity
 struct: no
 struct: I just check if ball is alligned to goal
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: So I can use flipendo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just read the loca, post mortem, some of the NN strategies are very interesting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: loca=locam
 MSmits: is a nn nr 1?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: nice clobber bot, what's your approach? ab or mcts?
 MSmits: wait huh
 darkhorse64: you like my boss&#160;?
 Wontonimo: oh PatrickMcGinnisII you suggested Ghost in the cell.  thanks.  Noone liked anything from my list.  That's very interesting
 MSmits: gitc is fun
 MSmits: not easy to write a seach for though
 MSmits: search
 darkhorse64: Just kidding, mcts 
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: the boss is some random crap
 Astrobytes: Nice.
 Jstn123: I need some help coding. Is there anyone who can teach me
 <b>**Astrobytes flees</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I remembered I need to go do that thing in the thing with the thingy
 reCurse: Sorry cat is on fire brb
 struct: o.o
 AntiSquid: ^ don't overcook it
 MSmits: don't smoke near the cat
 Astrobytes: *don't let the cat smoke
 MSmits: and that
 jacek: who let the cats out?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the cat smokes AFTER you put her fire out
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 Astrobytes: who let the cats out? meow, meow-meow-meow...
 Wontonimo: Jstn123 the challenges here mostly assume you have the basics down, like if statements and loops.
 AntiSquid: Jstn123 the secrets of the universe can be unlocked by googling this passphrase: lmgtfy
 Jstn123: what
 Jstn123: thank you?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=learn+basic+programming">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=learn+basic+programming</a>
 AntiSquid: thank the galactic spirit
 Jstn123: who
 Astrobytes: oh that's where lmgtfy went
 tibithegreat: I clicked on the link because I waned to see what the animation looks like
 Jstn123: oooh ok
 tibithegreat: and google now probably thinks I want to learn basic programming
 tibithegreat: I'm probably gonna get some weird ads the next few days
 Jstn123: yep
 MSmits: google thinks I want to learn to work the stockmarket and buy/sell houses
 Astrobytes: Nothing wrong with throwing them off the scent&#160;;)
 MSmits: i have 0 interest in that
 MSmits: but keep getting the adds, for months now
 darkhorse64: adblock saves your time and your bandwidth
 Jstn123: who codes using lua
 Astrobytes: Absolutely no one.
 AntiSquid: i think it was from the Foundation Trilogy, not sure anymore, but you should definitely read it Jstn123
 reCurse: ublock origin
 reCurse: adblock and ublock are riddled with bad stuff
 Jstn123: what about java, anyone use that
 MSmits: what bad stuff?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo some basic algorithms to have in your arsenal are mostly pathfinding, like dfs, dijkstra  ... but alot of times with these contests bruteforcing, mcts, alphabeta min max, etc. is all about maximizing nodes... ok ill shutup, i never get large number of nodes
 Wontonimo: tibithegreat nice jump in rank on uttt
 struct: 3 billion devices
 AntiSquid: lua is used for cheatengine scripts Astrobytes&#160;!
 reCurse: lmgtfy&#160;;)
 struct: iirc adblock sells data if you dont opt out
 MSmits: do quality nodes instead of quantity PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: it has it's uses, that and Roblox I suppose. You were correct about Foundation btw
 tibithegreat: Wontonimo the only change I made was that I was running iteration until 95 ms passed from the turn time
 MSmits: have the bestest nodes
 tibithegreat: and I changed it to 99
 AntiSquid: well ublock origin is from the actual creator
 Wontonimo: @PatrickMcGinnisII thanks.  Yeah thats good stuff&#160;!
 Jstn123: everyone here is nice, I like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I had to google lmgtfy
 reCurse: rip
 Astrobytes: 'ded'
 MSmits: :door:
 Wontonimo: tibithegreat i've got mine set to 98ms and it is just enough to not time out.  HAve you tried pushing it closer and watched the replays to make sure you arn't getting dropped?
 Jstn123: can some one go on marslander with me
 MSmits: that one looks like tombstone/crypt door to me
 Wontonimo: tibithegreat oh, sorry, didn't read your update
 Astrobytes: Jstn123: I'm low on gas and you don't have a spacesuit
 Jstn123: lol
 tibithegreat: Wontonimo I just pushed it to 99, did a few matches against a default AI
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes ah yes it is, that book is awesome i wish they'd made it into a movie, TV series without butchering it, but that's too much to ask
 tibithegreat: saw it was good
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Weren't they doing it?
 Westicles: All that psychohistory business was a little sketchy
 Jstn123: byeguys be back in maybe 10
 MSmits: see ya in 10 days
 AntiSquid: idk, got to check
 Astrobytes: Was of its time I suppose
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So SOMEONE made me download IntelliJ...  is anyone currently using google adMob?  I mean, does it really make any $?
 AntiSquid: are you sure Westicles&#160;? it's very well explained + you should check out stuff like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://massivesci.com/articles/brain-brain-interfaces-mind-control/">https://massivesci.com/articles/brain-brain-interfaces-mind-control/</a>
 MSmits: is this a maffia thing PatrickMcGinnisII?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: adserver for mobile apps/games
 MSmits: join google adMob.... or sleep with the fishes
 Westicles: I always wondered if Popper wrote The Poverty of Historicism after reading Foundation
 AntiSquid: some no longer secret US research was dealing with reprogramming people with just light signals ... crazy
 MSmits: works fine
 MSmits: i see students all the time getting reprogrammed with that rectangle that gives off light they're always looking at
 Wontonimo: that concept of reprogramming with light really got into mainstream movies 
 Astrobytes: Intriguing theory westicles
 Astrobytes: *idea
 Astrobytes: Yeah MSmits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid MKUltra lol.  LMDR is shown to be innefective w/o the use of drugs
 Wontonimo: Foundation series was fun.  inspiration to a few nice space rpgs
 MSmits: I've been rewatching the series 24
 MSmits: they use a lot of drugs in interrogations
 Astrobytes: Wat
 AntiSquid: easy fix imo PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh another Asimov fan
 Astrobytes: We've been directly and indirectly talking about Asimov (spec. Foundation) for the last 5 minutes PatrickMcGinnisII
 UnnamedCodinGamer: first three books of the Foundation series were good
 UnnamedCodinGamer: then it got a bit watered down
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need a nuclear powered throne
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but great imagination
 AntiSquid: it got a bit weird :D
 Astrobytes: Oh hey UnnamedCodinGamer: did you start your MCTS tutorial tech.io thing?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: no, not yet
 Wontonimo: what's that?
 AntiSquid: i thought biological internet of things at galactic scale is cool 
 elderlybeginner: when and how do you eject in codebusters?
 struct: you dont know tech io Wontonimo?
 Astrobytes: It was a bit of a mindf**k after the first 3 it's true
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but I shared the link in the chat
 Wontonimo: struct nope, but now i do
 struct: i guess cg is doing something wrong then
 Wontonimo: UnnamedCodinGamer are you making a MCTS tutorial there?
 struct: or did they just abandon it?
 Astrobytes: I missed that link, must've closed the window after I was afk earlier
 JayM9: h
 JayM9: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someone mentioned a VB run powergrid yesterday... but that's how they do things in Texas.&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: OH ... yeah, i recognize it from the playground thingie.  didn't really pay attention to the branding tbh
 Astrobytes: struct: They've never really used it to it's potential imo
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: :rofl:
 struct: Well its like me
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I had an idea to make a playground - simple code to play around with - more of a proof of concept thing
 struct: I write the sim then never finish the actual AI
 struct: So its wasted potential
 Astrobytes: But you make great games nonetheless
 Astrobytes: And you still have time to fulfil that potential
 struct: I dont really like to think I make games
 struct: I only port them
 Astrobytes: CG have kinda missed their own boat wrt tech.io
 Astrobytes: Yeah OK, but good ports
 AntiSquid: just need to think of it as a game that plays itself or a game that plays other games and then maybe you can finish it struct
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Astrobytes, here is the link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/2oI54uz">https://tech.io/snippet/2oI54uz</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do not know if it is understandable enough
 Wontonimo: my kids laugh at me for programming my computer to play games for me ... sigh, I haven't converted them yet
 UnnamedCodinGamer: consuming is easier than creating
 AntiSquid: show them the power of automation in their own games
 jacek: power of AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: who the first test case doesn't work for me
 Wontonimo: Noooooo
 tibithegreat: show them factorio
 tibithegreat: that should get them to learn the power of automation
 AntiSquid: what are they playing Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: after I had my adrenaline shot for unexpected exposure to Java (j/k) I have seen your code.Decent basic implementation, speaks for itself if you know it but if you want it to be useful you might have to break it down into chunks with more explanation?
 Wontonimo: my son was pretty big into redstone mechanics, so partly redeemed 
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid currently, my son is into some FPS and my daughter still into minecraft
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Astrobytes, hah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is based on code that I wrote a while back
 JammSpread: you should try getting them into minecraft modding
 JammSpread: serverside plugins is easier
 AntiSquid: FPS -&gt; autoaim scripts, minecraft -&gt; MineRL challenge, damn even making a diamond is hard
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: the code doesn't have to be optimised or anything, just explanations alongside the snippets of each part, then full code at the end to play with
 Wontonimo: i made a server side mod for them a few years back, gave everyone classes and power phrases... they loved it, but again just interested in consuming not creating
 struct: garrys mod also allows you to code inside the game
 struct: you can use lua
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am not sure about more explanation - as I imagine it it  should be for people who have read the theory but for some reason struggle to implement it
 struct: or expression 2
 UnnamedCodinGamer: as I did
 Wontonimo: struct garrys mod eh?  oh, that's cool
 KelvinAndHobbes: Gotten the "Capcta: are you a human" 3 times in a row in CoC, does it just really think I'm a bot?
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: Is there not full Java code out there already?
 JammSpread: stackoverflow does that every time i search now
 geppoz: uhm the "mars lander" banner was always that way or they updated in honor to Perseverance?
 JayM9: I am getting major errors
 JayM9: I am unsure why
 Astrobytes: Talk to General Problems, he will help JayM9
 Wontonimo: geppoz afair it's been that way always
 geppoz: so that landing configuration was known years ago? nice
 Westicles: geppoz, what's up with all that math in your beach volleyball solution?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Astrobytes, maybe, but I am bad at reading other people's code 
 tibithegreat: geppoz the skycrane was used for curiosity as well
 UnnamedCodinGamer: for some reason I think that my version is clearer&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: That's fair, it takes some practice that's for sure
 geppoz: Westicles that the solution of a 4th grade equation
 UnnamedCodinGamer: which may not be true
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: I find it clear yeah
 geppoz: tibithegreat uh, I didn't know, ty, I tought was still airbag tecnique
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks for looking at it
 geppoz: Westicles that is a O(1) solution of the problem&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: No worries, maybe other people can contribute to it with other language implementations? 
 Astrobytes: @UnnamedCodinGamer
 Westicles: I see.  I tried to take the derivative and find a closed-form solution, but couldn't get it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes 
 Wontonimo: I had added the label "Snell's Law" to the challenge but for some reason it got removed.
 Westicles: They only allow approved tags
 Wontonimo: "Snell" is just so racy ... i get it
 Astrobytes: lmao
 UnnamedCodinGamer: or other implementation of certain steps - for instance here at the expansion step all children are expanded at once - you can expand single child at a time
 geppoz: Westicles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/KjSGYBt">https://ibb.co/KjSGYBt</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it saves memory 
 Astrobytes: Sure, depends on your node size but yeah, different implementations would be cool
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have it already
 UnnamedCodinGamer: in another version
 Westicles: nice
 UnnamedCodinGamer: less nodes are being created
 Wontonimo: what i found useful for my first implementation of MCTS (which you may want to include) is a deterministic example to turn into a unit test.

 geppoz: it would be great if CG would rate solutions based on time/memory consumption
 Wontonimo: don't know if unit tests are all the rage where you are publishing this
 geppoz: it will become little more interesting to optimize even the normal puzzles
 AntiSquid: seen, best video on mcts Wontonimo :D
 Astrobytes: geppoz: I guess that's only really doable with the bot programming 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will take a look
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid and that's saying sometrhing considering the crazy shaking of the camera
 AntiSquid: in general very few youtubers get straight to the point and explain things clearly
 geppoz: Astrobytes, no, leetcode does it
 Wontonimo: geppoz, no, leetcode + that guy = still very few
 Astrobytes: geppoz: Sure, and projecteuler too iirc, I just mean with the way CG is currently set up
 Wontonimo: lol
 AntiSquid: leetcode also rates you based on fail attempts no?
 AntiSquid: find that a big drawback
 Astrobytes: That's the 1337 part :P
 AntiSquid: pointless stat
 Astrobytes: ...?
 Astrobytes: It would just be code without the leet!
 Wontonimo: sorry geppoz .. i got confused
 Astrobytes: I do agree though AntiSquid
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Wontonimo, I remembered watching this video a couple of years back
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is a nice one
 UnnamedCodinGamer: however if I remember correctly it is an implementation of single player mcts
 UnnamedCodinGamer: (explanation)
 dericeketli: alooooooooooooo
 Astrobytes: +extra points for the lecture being for the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, Scotland)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I love the way he goes into details
 UnnamedCodinGamer: showing exactly what is happening
 Astrobytes: Yeah, good lecturer
 Wontonimo: WW bot game never came up in the top recommendations, yet I seem to recall there being some positive chat about it.  Thoughts?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, good game
 Astrobytes: I need to get back to that actually
 Astrobytes: Very fun
 Astrobytes: Based on this iirc:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini</a>
 AntiSquid: it depends from person to person Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: Ofc, as I said earlier it's all very subjective. You should try everything
 AntiSquid: the contests back then also had the disadvantage of a forced break after contest, you lost interest completely by the time it got released
 AntiSquid: you can play it online: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=santorini">https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=santorini</a>
 Wontonimo: pull a codebullet and make a bot slaughter humans
 darkhorse64: I have tried almost every multi on CG: there are 3 that are so-so for me: Code Royale, Code of Kutulu and mostly Botters of The Galaxy. All others are interesting to play
 Wontonimo: oh, code royal is iffy, good to know.  
 Wontonimo: i was looking at Botters, and it just seems too kludgy for me.
 Wontonimo: I get it, the makers were trying to probably do something anti-mcts
 Wontonimo: and it was fun to write some if/then/else for it, but ultimately not really my speed
 darkhorse64: Too messy for me. My favorites are OOC, PCR, Crystal Rush, Yavalath
 Astrobytes: BotG is a no-go for me, didn't like PacMan, Code Royale was so-so, That Cooking Game (Code a la mode), 
 struct: o.o
 Wontonimo: who made BotG?
 Astrobytes: I'm a cussy funt though
 AntiSquid: there was no intent to make it anti-mcts lol
 Astrobytes: Hmm Wontonimo, ask AntiSquid :D
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid who made BotG?
 AntiSquid: after some debate, we decided to make it focused around optimizing last hit deny on lane-units
 darkhorse64: I like Code a la Mode &amp; Code of Ice and Fire too. For most of the multi, there is something to learn 
 AntiSquid: it says in the description Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: Oh COIF was great
 AntiSquid: and it has a story&#160;!!
 struct: my problem is I dont really know how to code for some of those games
 struct: like CoIF
 Astrobytes: I hacked my way through it
 Wontonimo: well, i must be blind cuz i can't find it
 AntiSquid: the more i play coif the more i wonder why complain about some of the other games but praise coif 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/a-code-of-ice-and-fire">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/a-code-of-ice-and-fire</a>
 Wontonimo: i'll keep looking though
 Astrobytes: Hacky solutions the whole way through
 AntiSquid: CIF *
 AntiSquid: me and some others, one sec pls Wontonimo
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a> here at the top it says 
 AntiSquid: there wasn't even the intent to make it "hard to simulate" lol
 darkhorse64: Once again, nothing personal against these multis and congrats to the people who made the effort to design it
 AntiSquid: i am not taking it personal, you dislike it fine w/e
 Astrobytes: (but we still hate them :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )
 AntiSquid: i hate some multis and i wonder why do they get praise, could use same arguments against them
 Astrobytes: I will make an effort in BotG one day, but it's after UTTT for me (that means real low)
 JayM9: damn boys
 JayM9: just took an L
 Astrobytes: Ofc, everything is subjective
 JayM9: in the clash of code
 JayM9: could not figure it out
 JayM9: RIP
 JayM9: is there a way to look at past clash of codes
 JayM9: so I can go back and do the
 JayM9: withou the time 
 Wontonimo: hey, i'm in wood 1 in BotG lol
 Astrobytes: if you remember some keywords or the name sure JayM9

 darkhorse64: Hate is a very strong word, let's just say that some multis motivate me more
 Astrobytes: *strongly dislike
 Astrobytes: *find unappealing
 darkhorse64: Yeah, ths one
 darkhorse64: *this*
 Astrobytes: 'hate' can be used without much impact in English depending on tone and context, in French I think it's not quite the same
 Astrobytes: also, tone and context on the internet :rolling_eyes:
 derjack: :skull:
 darkhorse64: It's almost like saying you want to murder someone
 AntiSquid: hey just imagine how the guys at openAi felt while working on their dota2 project then, they stopped at 17 heroes i think and they ended up with a simplistic push one lane tactic for most part
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: Yes, that's very much the case in English if you use it aggressively. It's a commonly abused word that has lost its traditional impact over time.
 derjack: bloody hell
 Astrobytes: derjack is becoming unionjack
 JohnathanBarbee: I don't know. I very much want to murder my code some times.
 Astrobytes: That's a private grievance :P
 JohnathanBarbee: :grinning:
 JammSpread: why do i feel that shortest code problems on clash of code makes python op
 Astrobytes: Because you don't know Ruby
 JammSpread: oh lol
 JammSpread: i forgot them both
 Astrobytes: Right tool for the right job
 JammSpread: lol
 JammSpread: i use javascript in the meantime
 Astrobytes: You can still get decent results, you just need to practice golfing it
 JammSpread: I just wish you could multiply strings like you could in py
 Astrobytes: what is it in js? repeat()?
 JammSpread: yeah I think String.repeat
 JammSpread: still pythons operations i find superior
 Astrobytes: Like I said, if you wanna win golfing you need the right tool for the job
 JammSpread: Ok then, I'm going to retry learning python. Thanks.
 Astrobytes: I don't do it myself but it's the way to go. Ruby is also ridiculously OP in regards to golfing
 Astrobytes: If you do it right.
 JammSpread: yeah its the langs that try not to be too verbose and easier to learn
 JammSpread: don't even try golfing in Java
 Astrobytes: There's attempting to compete and there's just pain. Choose attempting to compete :P
 JammSpread: Totally, I tried one of them recently and even making a util function for the job was a headache.
 Theino: I do most coding in C#... I'm always very sad when I get a code golf problem
 JammSpread: C#, Java and C++ require boilerplate to even do a hello world.
 Astrobytes: If you're not bothered about ranking in clashes then that's fine. Clash ranking depreciates anyway
 Astrobytes: You can do puzzles/multis/optims instead for more permanent ranking
 JammSpread: I mean when they show you a metric even if you don't try to care its hard not to.
 Astrobytes: (and code golf too, though it's only 4 or 5 puzzles)
 Theino: I just try to hack it together in python and not come in last
 Theino: I started learning ruby before I decided I didn't want to work that hard for a few code golf problems
 Theino: I might change my mind...
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it takes some work to learn how to make things *that* unreadably short lol
 Astrobytes: But hey, I don't clash.
 Theino: I haven't been on codingame in awhile and found the new quest map... it made me want to do clash again
 Astrobytes: Hehe, you and a bunch of others :D
 Astrobytes: I gave that particular branch a miss
 JammSpread: The several character long langs on code.golf seem to be an utter headache
 Wontonimo: that quest map ... it dug deep into some primal motivation for me
 Astrobytes: Worked as intended then I guess.
 Astrobytes: It's cool you're digging the multis and not just clashes or whatever
 Astrobytes: It makes me somewhat sad when I see people missing the real meat of the site.
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth cough cough 5% cough cough.</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: Yeah. Innit.
 Astrobytes: Also BlaiseEbuth thanks for returning to normal form :D
 <b>**JammSpread is joining a new clash</b></p><p><img src="/a/59449061195531" /> BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. I prefer this one too.
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: gn all
 MSmits: gn!
 JammSpread: gn
 Wontonimo: gn
 jacek:  
 Wontonimo: i'ma gonna go
 Wontonimo: 2
 JammSpread: bye
 AntiSquid: gn8 astro
 Guillermo.: gn
 milad-mehri: ~~test~~
 milad-mehri: lol
 JayM9: yo
 JayM9: can someone help me
 JayM9: i am doing coders strike back 2
 Wontonimo: hey, how can i help?

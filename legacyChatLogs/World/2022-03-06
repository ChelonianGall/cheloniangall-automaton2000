 SuperWhiteFish: hi
 eulerscheZahl: atcoder optim contest started <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/asprocon8">https://atcoder.jp/contests/asprocon8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: after reading the task: i have to read it a few more times just to understand it
 HarryYo: If it would have been confidential I would have asked help from my dad. Right now he is out of city and out of my reach too
 HarryYo: Otherwise would have asked him for sure 
 5DN1L: I think we can't help you here.
 HarryYo: ok thnks np
 icecream17: with trolls vs castles, I wonder if there's a better ranking system
 Justin_Lowry: that moment when you realize that u can only code lua well if its roblox api
 NeelD31: is python golfer allowed or considered cheating?
 NeelD31: for clash of code
 Justin_Lowry: like for least lines id assume cheating
 ycsvenom: the shortest mode is counting characters not bytesso not cheatand the goal is to make the code as short as possible
 Justin_Lowry: i just spent 11 minutes working something out and then realized i can do a 3 line answer
 Justin_Lowry: ayeee new fastest time for a solve
 struct: eulerscheZahl are you up just for at coder?
 paatt: scanf("%[^\n]" what does it mean anyone?
 struct: scan everything until \n
 struct: \n = new line
 paatt: thanks!
 VizGhar: can i see the task without registering?

 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 VizGhar: huge memory limit for 2second task&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i'll wait a few days until topcoder starts
 jacek: :upside_down:
 VizGhar: I'd like to see next contest poster already&#160;:)
 VizGhar: (art)
 VizGhar: do we already know something about the contest already?
 martinpapa69: it will be an ai contest
 VizGhar: sounds good... I believe we know nothing more?&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: nah, thats all I've heard
 VizGhar: I can accept any format except the escape
 Jerrasterix: any good sites for practising competitive coding&#160;?? other than codeforces and leetcode
 Thorcode: dunno i'm learning leetcode and codeforces
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: hey guys what is the diference of normal list and enumerate list?
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: i don't know why pp use enumerate?
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: and for some puzzle here the enum can solve the puzzle but the normal list isn't
 Ayza: If you mean in for loops
 Ayza: enumerate gives you the value and the index
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: yep I know
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: what is the difference?
 Ayza: depending on the puzzle the index might be an important part
 Ayza: so that's why using enumerate wins over using a normal loop
 Aimee.S: is leetcode for python3 programmers too?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: it for a lot of language programmers
 Mortis_666: Nice <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/DaX1l2b">https://imgur.com/a/DaX1l2b</a>
 eulerscheZahl: have fun Jerrasterix<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/resources/">https://clist.by/resources/</a>
 abt8601: Wait, CodinGame's account number is just 44k?
 Thorcode: yeah XD
 abt8601: Or is it the number of accounts that have participated in a contest?
 eulerscheZahl: contest players
 eulerscheZahl: CG has less contests. so that number is understandably lower than codeforces with weekly events
 eulerscheZahl: that clist site had a lot of statistics, really cool. it's created by "aropan" who's also active on codingame
 JFB: eulerscheZahl said: "after reading the task: i have to read it a few more times just to understand it" - so maybe because it was just in kanji&#160;?&#160;;-)
 ahozepha: for each input you take the count the number of words which start with the same letter
 ahozepha: and you pick the shortest one
 eulerscheZahl: they have an english version and also a visualizer to see the sample input+output
 ahozepha: and order the word to output that word
 eulerscheZahl: but i'd rather save my energy for topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: tiny chance of still making it to the finals, but unlikely
 ahozepha: is topcoder better than this one and how please?
 ahozepha: i'd really like to know why please?
 ahozepha: no judjement here, i myselft train though google kickstart and code jam
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know the task yet. they have more and less interesting ones
 eulerscheZahl: i'm talking about the marathon track. 1 optimization problem and 1 week to solve it
 eulerscheZahl: i've played codejam the last 5 or 6 years with mediocre success. it's just completely different from marathons
 ahozepha: okay then
 ahozepha: i'll definitely try
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan just confirmed that he'll play the atcoder one
 Illedan: I trusted you
 Illedan: But yeah
 Illedan: xD
 Jerrasterix: Thanks eulerscheZahl for the link :smile:
 JFB: So no one will participate in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/dashboard">https://www.gocoder.one/dashboard</a> (bomberland)? Final is April 3th 
 JFB: My poor bot is 3th. And bot from 1st position probably will not improve&#160;:-(
 struct: how long ago did it started?
 eulerscheZahl: looked into it a bit. but when i want to code in c#, there's a lot to do just to get started
 eulerscheZahl: and matches only once per week, so you can barely test anything
 JFB: In December. But it is not many paricipants
 nitekat: There's no any participants in the latest clash event, after 5 minutes since that clash should start. So I came in, wait for the 2 minutes count down, more people came in, then the clash start, and ..... 8 minutes later the clash is over :laughing: wth
 eulerscheZahl: game itself seems ok, but those 2 points turn me off
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - yes 
 eulerscheZahl: do you know what you won in the mid-terms already?
 JFB: But it is starter kit in Python, Go and C++  
 JFB: I do not asked&#160;:-)
 JFB: To be honest any cash from Australia will be bit tax problem for me&#160;:-)
 JFB: *big tax problem
 eulerscheZahl: at least you get the possibility to pay taxes
 JFB: Now I have tax problem with payments from topcoder 
 eulerscheZahl: german customs just shipped my RAIC tshirt+hoodie back to Russia without even asking
 JFB: Now any contact with Russia is a big problem, I understand
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i have no idea who topcoder taxing works. won $50, received all of it except paypal fees (expected $35 after 30% US taxes)
 eulerscheZahl: that RAIC was in January
 eulerscheZahl: so do i have to pay taxes in germany?
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: dunno
 JFB: I do not know german taxes
 struct: 30% paypal fees?
 JFB: 30% US tax
 struct: ah
 eulerscheZahl: your reading comprehension can be improved&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: is your topcoder payment from the weather prediction or something else?
 eulerscheZahl: i got rewarded for spam submitting. no joke
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: can someone tell me why the -3vel is effective in search race and mad pod racing
 eulerscheZahl: they drew random winners among submission of the week
 JFB: Yes - from weather prediction 
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: really
 JFB: Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk - simply speaking - because it is&#160;;-) 
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: lmao
 JFB: But seriously - it is special case of move general one. 
 Hackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk: gonna change name
 JFB: *more general 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still on the edge whether or not to try bomberland
 eulerscheZahl: looks like an easy top3 but the setup...
 eulerscheZahl: i'm in this state for several weeks already
 struct: how long will it take me to setup docker for c++?
 martinpapa69: docker :dizzy_face:
 eulerscheZahl: with the mid-terms stream i first saw the bots in action. replays aren't even public so it was hard to estimate the strength of the competition
 eulerscheZahl: JFB was kind enough to create that C++ starter btw
 JFB: 1st bot probably will not improve. Author is from Russia and just going abroad from the country so have other problems
 struct: I probably wont try it, Im very bad on these types of games
 JFB: 1st bot is mainly: pathfinding + avoid places in bomb range + go to the midle of the board as fast as possible
 eulerscheZahl: JFB at #3 still dying to own bombs
 JFB: Exactly&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: and randomly placing bombs. or like the guy on the stream called it: "map control"
 JFB: Randomly but with weights&#160;;-)
 JFB: At least&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: they also had someone on their server talking about neural networks. and then mentioned low sim as bottleneck. he uses the game engine via some process communication to simulate future turns
 eulerscheZahl: this is so totally beatable if i could find some motivation
 JFB: It is 2nd bot
 JFB: From Germant by the way
 JFB: *Germany 
 eulerscheZahl: i saw that
 eulerscheZahl: but germany is big, i don't know the competitor
 jacek: :scream:
 JFB:&#160;:-) Really?&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: yes. we are at least 7 people in Germany. probably more
 JFB:&#160;:-D
 jacek: id say there are 10 people in germany

 MSmits: hi guys
 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: welcome back
 abt8601: hello
 MSmits: yeah, havent had time for chat
 JFB: hi
 MSmits: been busy coding for cg anyways though. I got a working endgame book generator for nine mens morris now
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/jVG2YRA">https://imgur.com/a/jVG2YRA</a>
 MSmits: it's on 8x7, should be at most a few days till it's done, then it becomes easy to solve
 eulerscheZahl: that's a lot of bestand
 eulerscheZahl: look at that Grootte
 MSmits: nothing compared to my oware books
 MSmits: lol&#160;:)
 JFB:&#160;:-) When you prepare endgame book generatr for chess&#160;?&#160;;-)
 MSmits: nah chess is too hard
 MSmits: I could do a few pieces maybe, but dont see much point
 eulerscheZahl: jacek your turn
 MSmits: what do you mean his turn?
 eulerscheZahl: somehow the word "hard" triggers him
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: did anyone else solve nmm here? I found a DB online somewhere, but the source code was hungarian
 MSmits: so i dont know how to index the file and get the results out
 eulerscheZahl: i hate it when that happens
 <b>**eulerscheZahl codes in English</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: well it was partially english, just all the comments were hungarian and you really need those
 <b>**eulerscheZahl comments in English</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: the algorithms to index endgame books are difficult
 eulerscheZahl: if /me comments at all
 MSmits: yeah everything i do is english except when teaching
 MSmits: also sometimes using your own language gets you past reserved keywords
 MSmits: lijst = []
 eulerscheZahl: right, you code in python now. maybe you want to play bomberland
 MSmits: whats that?
 eulerscheZahl: bot contest
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/docs/getting-started">https://www.gocoder.one/docs/getting-started</a>
 eulerscheZahl: finals in 1 month
 MSmits: is that like hypersonic?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland">https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland</a>there's the animation i was looking for
 eulerscheZahl: 1 vs 1. but each player controls 3 units
 MSmits: oh I see
 MSmits: kinda like hypersonic
 jacek: oh, i missed the hard part&#160;:(
 MSmits: are you playing that?
 MSmits: jacek how come, was it not working for a while? Should visit a doctor
 eulerscheZahl: no. i have some objections to the website
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl 03:33PMi'm still on the edge whether or not to try bomberlandlooks like an easy top3 but the setup...i'm in this state for several weeks already
 jacek: also, have you seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://48stones.com/challenge/">https://48stones.com/challenge/</a> some oware like challenge
 eulerscheZahl: is this the same oware as on CG or different variation?
 MSmits: if it is the same, i can draw it probably
 jacek: i think yes. maybe except few endgames edge cases
 jacek: as i understand you compete against their database mostly
 eulerscheZahl: using a website to manually play moves that your bot prints
 eulerscheZahl: and they do the same with their database bot
 MSmits: so I run my oware meta mcts and play the moves? Seems easy
 eulerscheZahl: yes. you are the interface
 jacek: playok aka kurnik.pl which hosts many games mostly card games online
 jacek: and paper soccer
 MSmits: I think my offline db is actually perfect for this as it does not use the endturn 200 from CG
 eulerscheZahl: get them stuck in an infinite loop. and then win by clicking on the website faster than they do. so they lose by timeout
 MSmits: haha, no, on loop the game ends afaik
 MSmits: loops are not easy to get early game though
 eulerscheZahl: does the website know this?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: they equally distribute seeds on loop
 MSmits: so basically net score added = 0
 jacek: i think there is something on their rules
 eulerscheZahl: but does kurnik.pl have a loop detection?
 MSmits: it just records gamestates i guess
 MSmits: if a repeat happens, it's a loop
 jacek: As part of general game etiquette, players are asked, in the event of a loop during the endgame, to settle the game by distributing to the players the remaining seeds in play. This is to avoid excessively long games, waiting for the playok platform to recognise the loop (which on rare occasions may not settle the end result accurately, a known flaw in playok).
 struct: etiquette?
 struct: my bot doesnt know that word
 eulerscheZahl: but you as a human interface do
 MSmits: I can have the meta mcts running games while playing vs their bot
 MSmits: so it explorers whatever gamestate it's on
 MSmits: then when it's down to 36 seeds on the board, all moves would be perfect
 MSmits: it's just the first 12 seeds that are uncertain, but i have like 50 million games played, i doubt it makes mistakes
 struct: doesnt their bot have 48 seeds db?
 MSmits: yeah but that means i can draw
 jacek: i cant. my pictures are horrible
 MSmits: my opening book is perfect against any opponent on the CG leaderboard already, it's just i havent trained a NN on the last 36 seed endgame book yet, so it makes mistakes when going below 37 seeds
 MSmits: but offline, that is no issue
 MSmits: so how does this work. I register and get contacted by this guy?
 jacek: dunno. just posting random links :shrug:
 eulerscheZahl: find out, for the honors of CG community
 MSmits: well i registered, going to try and beat him. 
 struct: gl
 struct: if you dont draw Ill ban you
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: you have karma points left for unbanning darkhorse
 MSmits: why was he banned?&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 MSmits: uh oh
 MSmits: seems like I missed some drama
 eulerscheZahl: oh yeah
 struct: Im not really sure, I just unbanned him
 eulerscheZahl: complained about squidd sharing questionable links in discord status message
 MSmits: and squid banned him?
 eulerscheZahl: so squiddy used his mod powers to ban him. then some events that i don't know either. now squiddy is deleted from CG
 MSmits: are we talking about the negated squid?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: he really went too far this time then
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/e9c83cc4767eb16667a33d90907479d08093402">https://www.codingame.com/profile/e9c83cc4767eb16667a33d90907479d08093402</a>
 eulerscheZahl: bots also gone
 MSmits: I see
 jacek: oh my
 struct: Even His bots are gonne
 struct: gone*
 eulerscheZahl: but then who prints MUDA MUDA as a message?
 eulerscheZahl: i never figured out what that even means
 struct: "Something that happens when an anime character gets angry and punches things."
 jacek: puta?
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: btw jacek, i think your bot may have a shot at drawing in that oware challenge also
 MSmits: it often plays perfectly in the first 12 seeds anyways
 MSmits: havent much checked deeper than that
 jacek: and it can have more time
 MSmits: yeah, just make sure you adapt it to let go of the 200 turn limit
 MSmits: shouldnt have any problematic consequences i think, unless you made the turn index part of the input
 MSmits: i dont think you did
 jacek: nope
 ycsvenom: Scrabble problem is really ambiguous or is it just me? 
 jacek: hm?
 ycsvenom: sometimes it prefer length ,sometimes prefer score , sometimes prefer no-repetition
 ycsvenom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/scrabble">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/scrabble</a>
 MAWAAW: prefer score
 ycsvenom: sometimes it give false answer for that
 eulerscheZahl: share your code if you want. just paste it in the chat
 ycsvenom: it suddenly work :expressionless:
 ycsvenom: but here it is
 ycsvenom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c17b87a-f1e1-425c-a472-d8b3d6281781">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c17b87a-f1e1-425c-a472-d8b3d6281781</a>
 ycsvenom: i will clean code somethings before submitting
 martinpapa69: bruhh, use code formatter 
 martinpapa69: (){) {
 martinpapa69: im in tears
 ycsvenom: i used it &gt;_&lt;
 eulerscheZahl: that's what annoys you?
 eulerscheZahl: for me it'swordScores.erase(wordScores.begin()+i--);
 eulerscheZahl: the end in particular (pasted again because of linebreak above)wordScores.begin()+i--;
 martinpapa69: im more annoyed about incosistent format
 martinpapa69: for(int i=0;i&lt;wordScores.size();i++){
 VizGhar: for me its single line for block on separate line :P
 VizGhar: (and without {} of course)
 ycsvenom: guysi didn't know that my code is that shity &gt;_&lt;
 martinpapa69: its not that bad, ive seen much worse
 eulerscheZahl: i do that block of 1 statement without {} too sometimes
 Aimee.S: better than me still..
 eulerscheZahl: i just avoid i++ or i-- in combination with other math operations
 ycsvenom: it's annoying for me to make a 1 block statement with {}
 eulerscheZahl: a++ + ++b
 ycsvenom: why?
 ycsvenom: no i don't use it like
 ycsvenom: that
 martinpapa69: while(i--&gt;0)
 eulerscheZahl: classic
 ycsvenom: never -_-
 ycsvenom: i use it just for erasing things
 martinpapa69: its fine to leave the {} imo
 eulerscheZahl: btw you get rid of the fabulous putin avatar in time martinpapa69, well done
 martinpapa69: but if you leave it, leave it for the whole block
 martinpapa69: like for()if()if() do_something();
 VizGhar: a+=++i*2
 eulerscheZahl: when nesting for, if, ... i only leave out the {} on the inner-most place
 ycsvenom: b+=i+++++j
 VizGhar: :D
 martinpapa69: putin avatar :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: i remember that
 eulerscheZahl: from when you were Csipcsirip
 ycsvenom: i found you on codeforces euler
 MAWAAW: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/628be599-92e4-4830-b8f9-a67636ad3260">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/628be599-92e4-4830-b8f9-a67636ad3260</a>
 ycsvenom: you are a candidate master
 martinpapa69: that was not putin
 eulerscheZahl: not too impressive but ok-ish. i rarely play on topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: didn't you have the putin with naked upper body half on a horse?
 martinpapa69: nah that was me
 eulerscheZahl: "i'm so fabulous"
 eulerscheZahl: s/topcoder/codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes they have marathon rounds. but these are unrated
 JFB: ycsvenom - for me this code is correct . Of course +i-- and one line if, for without {} is potentially asking for troble but it looks that you do not make mistake. I think that you can have performance issues: personally I will use const string&amp; in instead of string in functions definitions

 ycsvenom: check that 
 ycsvenom: i used already i was just testing
 VizGhar: we are just making fun of you&#160;:) no stress if it works
 ycsvenom: i learned it from theCherrno
 ycsvenom: no problem
 eulerscheZahl: different people have different styles
 VizGhar: just don't sell this code
 ycsvenom: LOOOOOL
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. a prof of mine condemned
 eulerscheZahl: "use {} or place the assignment in the same line as the for"
 VizGhar: we still didn't tell him why
 MAWAAW: now ur ready for <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/winamax-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/winamax-sponsored-contest</a>
 ycsvenom: my prof condemned me for using for statement :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: actually there's a famous bug that could have been avoided with that code style
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&amp;hashCtx, &amp;signedParams))&#160;!= 0)
 VizGhar: I know that this is not root of problem but still
 ycsvenom: isn't "goto" a bad thing in code?because it make debugging harder 
 JFB: i-- make debugging harder&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: it's widely considered bad practice, creating spaghetti code
 VizGhar: if you are not using blocks {} for if/for/while/anything body, you will -sooner or later- miss the bug euler pinpointed.
 JFB: goto make code less readable (spagetti code as eulerscheZahl said)&#160;:-)
 ycsvenom: depending on the place :smily_face:
 ycsvenom: i mean i--
 martinpapa69: rust doesnt even allow if/for... without  {}. superior coding language
 ycsvenom: i totally agree on goto thing
 VizGhar: if (a) { thingone; thingtwo) };will execute thingthwo only if a == true, butif(a) thingone; thingwto will execute thingtwo no matter what
 ycsvenom: what's new :neutral_face:
 VizGhar: not sure you got me :D maybe there is nothing new
 eulerscheZahl: just use python, problem solved
 VizGhar: I made same mistake in production some 7 years back
 JFB: eulerscheZahl&#160;:-D
 ycsvenom: i don't want a new line for "i--" so i have composed it with that statement
 VizGhar: pyhton ftw
 ycsvenom: @VizGhar counter+=txt[i] == ch;what do you think about that &gt;-&lt;
 martinpapa69: after using python for like 4 years, i almost dont hate it anymore
 ycsvenom: ALMOST
 Hyperplane: ALMOOST*
 martinpapa69: after all the tab-bullshit our relationship cant be fixed
 JFB: By the way. You have cout &lt;&lt; validWords.size() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; validScores.size() &lt;&lt; endl;
 5DN1L: martinpapa69 use spaces instead of tabs &lt;solved&gt;
 ycsvenom: it would be better if it had "end" like lua
 eulerscheZahl: Pascal also has begin, end as keywordsyet i wouldn't recommend the language
 ycsvenom: JFB i know i am debugging i still have bug
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't even have generics. library has a stringlist for you. but a list of your own class? good luck
 JFB: For debugin guse cerr instead cout 
 ycsvenom: :thumbsup:
 JFB: ycsvenom - in description: a letter can only be used once
 JFB: In your previous code you do not check duplicates
 JFB: in last code your checking is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: oh, somehow i thought he passes all testcases now and didn't check for correctness
 JFB: rep/2 &lt; 2 is true for rep = 1. rep == 1 is for one duplicat. 
 ycsvenom: yes i saw it just now :worried:
 JFB: inply instead of rep += count &gt; 1; use if (count&gt;1) return false; 
 ycsvenom: i tried thatbut there is cases like "which"
 ycsvenom: there is two 'h'
 ycsvenom: so i am checking if there is more than one duplicate
 eulerscheZahl: but why?
 eulerscheZahl: you should check if you have more of a kind than in the letters given to you
 ycsvenom: because of this "restaurateur" = 12"satire" = 6they prefer satire because there is no duplicate
 ycsvenom: the test number 7
 eulerscheZahl: now you make me open the puzzle again to prove you wrong
 eulerscheZahl: aretsuithat's the letters you have
 ycsvenom: i just realized that the first one is more than length of letters in the first place :relaxed:
 eulerscheZahl: how many r's do you have in "aretsui"?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, something doesn't work out
 ycsvenom: thanks to you all
 ycsvenom: i finished it :grimacing:

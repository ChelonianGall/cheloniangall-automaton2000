 hsm_akb: guys im having a problem in my code
 hsm_akb: can anybody hel[?
 hsm_akb: help?*
 BobLob: What's the issue and is it language specific?
 hsm_akb: its in pytho and the issue is simple but i dont know wgat to do
 hsm_akb: program:
 hsm_akb: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0db53626-97ce-476c-abad-d377da02df13">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0db53626-97ce-476c-abad-d377da02df13</a>
 hsm_akb: the error:
 hsm_akb: line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
 c0nc4c: x = int(i) makes no sense in python if i'm right
 hsm_akb: then how should i ge the int of i
 hsm_akb: get*
 SuryaTheOP: i don't  think so, c0nc4c
 c0nc4c: x = i is fine
 BobLob: I don't know Python, but that's my understanding too.  Int(i) is trying to make a number from a strong, but i is already an integer
 Uljahn: num = chr(sum) &lt;- that's the problem
 Uljahn: should it be str(sum)?
 c0nc4c: i suppose num is a bunch of integers
 c0nc4c: so if u want to get i in num
 c0nc4c: for i in num: x = i
 hsm_akb: oh yeah ur right&#160;!
 hsm_akb: its fixed, thank you alot
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 Westicles: Anyone know how this __exec thing works in c?
 DaNinja: like system()&#160;?
 Westicles: yeah
 Westicles: It seems to be the key to the chuck norris 55 code golf
 Westicles: known only to the french and friends
 derjack: :frog:
 KiwiTae: I am in france i should know it&#160;:(
 tricolours: ello from the otha side
 BlaiseEbuth: Scandal! I'm not aware of this trick! :rage:
 Westicles: Hmmm, well I am 1/3 french am also am excluded
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 MSmits: the Dutch do not know of this trick
 MSmits: well I don't anyway, maybe counterbalance :P
 darkhorse64: I am french, if I give you the trick, will you give me the js compress thingy&#160;?
 darkhorse64: :wink:
 Westicles: :thinking:
 MSmits: whats the js compress thingy
 KiwiTae: utf32 enc?
 Westicles: The problem is I can't actually use it.  I don't have a bash or perl or whatever in CN to use
 darkhorse64: utf16 enc
 darkhorse64: Same Westicles
 derjack: js cant decode utf16?
 KiwiTae: i only know the python trick~
 Westicles: I have python and JS with 26 overhead.  Apparently there is a ruby with 25 char overhead, the __exec thing gives you C with 20, and I think also C++?
 darkhorse64: js compress thingy, something similar to the exec bytes trick in Python. 
 darkhorse64: I know of a js technique with escape/unescape but it has a high overhead. It's rumoured that there is something better
 Westicles: darkhorse64, do you really know the C one?
 darkhorse64: no, I was kidding. I guess it's a flavor of system() call. As you said, you must have first a very short golf solution in another language
 MSmits: is this a compression of the source code or a binary?
 Westicles: From the discussion, when you use __ exec you don't need main in C.  But didn't find much  searching for it
 Westicles: compressed bash in utf16 run from C with 20 character overhead
 darkhorse64: MSmits: not really compression just conversion of your chars to utf16
 Westicles: I bet the ruby one is very easy to figure out, I just suck at ruby
 Westicles: probably .encode and some gibberish
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/">https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 darkhorse64: :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix it :p
 MSmits: ah ok
 darkhorse64: ofc you have to include code that convert back utf16 and execute the result. So you have some overhead and never reach 50%
 MSmits: if you're going to use a trick i don't see any reason to use anything other than the shortest one. So if C is the shortest then any of the others are pointless
 darkhorse64: CG code golf scores your 5 best results
 MSmits: oh right, code golf. I was thinking about clash
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 MSmits: thats kinda cheap too. Find the shortest solution overall and then use 5 different tricks
 MSmits: instead of finding 5 different solutions
 darkhorse64: some people use that trick in clash. That makes others mad
 Westicles: I think I was targeted.  Like 50 of my golfs were ruby calls, and suddenly ruby mysteriously disappears from echo $PATH
 MSmits: hehe yeah
 darkhorse64: I will not enter this debate on system()
 togo: hi
 BlaiseEbuth: :eyes:
 togo: what's up
 Zedogx: hi

 KP56: in ultimate tic-tac-toe, what happens if in the left upper board i go to the left upper corner and that left upper corner is the last unclaimed field left on that board
 struct: opp can play anywhere
 Alshock: nothing, the next move can't be played in the prioritized board so he can play anywhere that's all
 Uljahn: that's why using teccles moves is beneficial
 MSmits: mmh not sure how that follows logically Uljahn
 AllYourTrees: what exactly are the rules for putting binary data in your submission in a multi again?
 struct: no rules for multis
 struct: only contest
 AllYourTrees: err contest then
 struct: I just dont think you can obfuscate functions and such
 Astrobytes: no obfuscation in contest submits
 struct: weights is fine
 AllYourTrees: what counts as obfuscation?
 Astrobytes: there's a definition on the forum I think somewhere
 KP56: changing all names of your functions and variables to some jibberish i guess
 TipuTare: can someone help me?

 TipuTare: i dont understand where i need to put the "thrust"
 struct: you dont need the word thrust
 struct: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 50")
 struct: should compile
 struct: 50 is the value of the thrust

 TipuTare: oh
 TipuTare: ty man
 TipuTare:  i had to put a bigger thrust tho
 AntiSquid: whats a normal amount of rollouts for Breakthrough (yes if you use MCTS)
 BlaiseEbuth: what's normal...
 struct: I think ept is used antisquid
 struct: so might be hard to say
 AntiSquid: alright, how many turns do you rollout&#160;? 10&#160;? 20&#160;? 50&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: for breakthrough i get between 400-500k rollouts first turn with fully random rollouts, no ept
 struct: I should be able to tell you soon, i should start coding it today
 AllYourTrees: inb4 struct gets 3 million rollouts
 AllYourTrees: :D
 AntiSquid: how do you handle opponent AllYourTrees&#160;? same tree&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: ya just 1 tree for both
 eulerscheZahl: wow, Sokoban is puzzle of the week. I totally didn't expect this as CG prefers easier puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: also hi
 struct: grats
 struct: hi
 BlaiseEbuth: CG prefer nothing... The bot choose, tibo click...
 AntiSquid: maybe they're saying make more puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: but he mentioned that he ignores some suggestions if it looks too hard
 TipuTare: whats with the angle thing in this?
 TipuTare: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/699332d2-ff6c-4495-ab52-aa6c657572e3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/699332d2-ff6c-4495-ab52-aa6c657572e3</a>
 TipuTare: why do i need it
 eulerscheZahl: because your pod has a direction which it's facing to and it can only turn by a small angle each turn
 MSmits: AntiSquid when people use EPT and eval after x turns, I don't think x is ever more than 10
 MSmits: when I do it, x = 0
 MSmits: but i guess it may help to go as high as 5 in some cases... papers say so
 TipuTare: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... TipuTare will no longer be active in this game.
 TipuTare: whats with this error
 Wontonimo: you timed out
 MSmits: it happens when your bot does not output
 eulerscheZahl: did you promote to a higher league?
 eulerscheZahl: input format changes on promotion
 TipuTare: wood 2
 TipuTare: i did
 MSmits: yeah coders strikes back is crap in that it changes its input format
 eulerscheZahl: there is a code reset button (top right in your IDE)
 Wontonimo: use the circular update button in the upper right 
 eulerscheZahl: but save the old code before you click it
 TipuTare: ok
 MSmits: I guess you can take the old code from the history tab right?
 TipuTare: still saying error
 AntiSquid: indentation missing on last line i guess
 AntiSquid: TipuTare
 Wontonimo: you can always get your previous "submit to arena" code version by clicking on "History"
 eulerscheZahl: let MK connect to you via teamviewer to help you
 MSmits: can be many things, but indentation is one yeah
 TipuTare: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... TipuTare will no longer be active in this game.

 eulerscheZahl: i think we can't help you with the information currently available
 TipuTare: oh no problem
 MSmits: you would need to share your entire code
 Wontonimo: I'll DM you and see if I can walk you through it
 MSmits: but the resetted code should work
 Wontonimo: yes, the reset should work
 eulerscheZahl: i can't even take your entire code and run it on my own, as i can't go back to wood2
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl is too advanced for this

 MSmits: ye indentation
 MSmits: you're doing everything outside of the game loop
 eulerscheZahl: legend
 TipuTare: ahahahah
 TipuTare: im so dumb
 TipuTare: ty
 MSmits: well not everthing
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://planetoids21.kattis.com/standings">https://planetoids21.kattis.com/standings</a>dbdr has to improve for his swap bag now
 MSmits: it's swag, not swap. If you can't type it, you don't have it
 eulerscheZahl: but he's still on track to "receive a story feature on ICPC social media channels"
 Wontonimo: TipuTare, it doesn't look like you are printing in the "if" part and only in the "else" part
 MSmits: I'll read a dbdr feature
 eulerscheZahl: it's just a missing indent for the last few lines, as already mentioned
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what a story feature even is
 TipuTare: ik 
 eulerscheZahl: you win the change to write a post mortem?
 eulerscheZahl: chanceÜ
 eulerscheZahl: chance*
 Wontonimo: TipuTare , here is your code fixed
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d893a8e0-04b1-4b46-8c96-791c0034ebcc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d893a8e0-04b1-4b46-8c96-791c0034ebcc</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i can't type anymore
 MSmits: once upon a time there was a dbdr, he jumped a spikey pit and became a master coder
 MSmits: summarized it
 TipuTare: i already fixed it but thx
 Wontonimo: cool
 MSmits: Wontonimo is that really fixed? The for loop seems outside the while loop...
 KP56: i dont see anything wrong in this code
 eulerscheZahl: for loop?
 MSmits: ohh wait
 MSmits: it goes on a new line for me
 Wontonimo: code formatting with pastebin
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: my pastebin was too zoomed
 eulerscheZahl: as we are talking about formatting: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/fzoNyaI">https://imgur.com/a/fzoNyaI</a>
 MSmits: the for started on a new line
 eulerscheZahl: how made that responsive design?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl's cat please let euler have the keyboard back
 eulerscheZahl: who*&#160;:(
 MSmits: but yeah that looks like crap
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't go that far. but is has it's weaknesses
 Wontonimo: I use$(".left-column").remove()&#160;; $(".chat-wrapper").width("100%")&#160;; $(".chat").width("100%")&#160;; $(".messages").width("100%")
 Wontonimo: to expand my window
 eulerscheZahl: as the dead links that BlaiseEbuth mentioned
 MSmits: Wontonimo I just use the square icon 
 MSmits: windows eh
 TipuTare: whats the difference betweem thrust and boost
 TipuTare: is boost more powerful?
 Wontonimo: what square icon?
 BlaiseEbuth: Right. Js site... :nauseated-face:
 KP56: boost is 650 thrust basically
 MSmits: at the top of the window, to maximize it :P
 eulerscheZahl: but Wontonimo gets a fullscreen chat with that command
 KP56: but you can only use it once
 TipuTare: ok
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: too fancy for me
 eulerscheZahl: but only works when the browser window is big enough to show the chat?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: it's hacky
 MSmits: must be nice to have those skills
 MSmits: i cant do fancy stuff with browsers
 MSmits: seems like the sort of thing you learn at work because you have to
 MSmits: I barely understand enough about html and css to teach my students, let alone php, js and all that
 struct: yeap nobody learns js because they want to
 Wontonimo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i learned how to analyze web requests because of the CG API
 MSmits: ah yeah, you even spent 2 hrs trying to teach me that
 MSmits: my first time using python
 MSmits: still have that somewhere
 Wontonimo: The full screen chat hack is really handy for work, as it hides most all the "game" elements of being on CG
 MSmits: "really handy for work" is not the right way to put it :P
 MSmits: "really handy not to have to work" is more like it
 MSmits: that's why I prefer to work from home. At least I can procrastinate grading tests without shame
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGChat">https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGChat</a> Just put that here. The script can also directly be used with violentmonkey and stuff.

 BlaiseEbuth: lot of monkeys
 TipuTare: can somebody help me with this
 TipuTare: i know im asking a lot so sorry
 MSmits: whats wrong with it?
 TipuTare: i get second place 
 MSmits: ok, but it doesnt crash?
 Wontonimo: nice TipuTare
 TipuTare: wait
 TipuTare: i can fix it
 KP56: gl
 Wontonimo: way to go.  generally speaking don't paste all your code here once your code has more than just the very basics
 Wontonimo: code segments are okay
 MSmits: yeah, this was ok, just dont do it when you get beyond wood
 Wontonimo: correct me if i'm wrong
 MSmits: not wrong
 KP56: why not?

 MSmits: because it's spoilers
 KP56: dw its not finished
 TipuTare: but whats wrong with my code i get second place
 Wontonimo: yeah, the point of the site it's to exercise peoples cut-and-paste skills
 TipuTare: but i use boost
 MSmits: if you need help, you can always go to PM, or DM as the young people call it
 TipuTare: oh ok
 KP56: what i did when i had a code similar to yours
 TipuTare:  i got rank 1
 TipuTare: my bad sorry 
 KP56: is i would keep track of all checkpoints during the first lap
 TipuTare: im a dummy&#160;:)
 KP56: and use boost when i reach the checkpoint where there is the highest distance between this one and the next one
 MSmits: but at least you are no longer a crash dummy
 TipuTare: yay
 MSmits: KP56 yeah i did that too
 TipuTare: what rank are you guys?
 BlaiseEbuth: KP56: First and last warning, don't share your code like this.
 KP56: in coders strike back?
 MSmits: usually somewhere between 7 and 12
 KP56: BlaiseEbuth there is nothing in it just some data structures
 TipuTare: my bad i meant division
 MSmits: legend
 KP56: i got silver on my own and to gold with a help of wontomino
 TipuTare: BlaiseEButh do u get banned or it?
 BlaiseEbuth: What?
 KP56: for pasting your coder
 KP56: code|*
 KP56: code*
 Wontonimo: yes
 MSmits: you can 
 MSmits: except when it's obviously harmless
 TipuTare: then can i dm you with the code?
 MSmits: such as TipuTare's just now
 KP56: i think you can
 TipuTare: or is that bad
 TipuTare: how do i get to the next division?
 KP56: think
 MSmits: when you dm, you dont get automatic pastebin
 TipuTare: i need to be first in my division right?
 MSmits: so you might need pastebin.com
 struct: sharing default code with a few ifs its fine
 MSmits: to promote yes TipuTare
 MSmits: the main leaderboard wont show the boss though, so you can be 1 there and 2 in reality
 MSmits: you need to beat the boss on the leaderboard
 KP56: really?
 Wontonimo: TipuTare, check your PM / DM
 MSmits: 993 in legend now. Soon not even the full legend list will show on the leaderboard of csb
 TipuTare: i checked
 TipuTare: gtg tho cuz its my grandma's birthday
 MSmits: go go
 TipuTare: byee
 MSmits: cya

 MSmits: in my textbook as a student it was always Alice and Bob

 MSmits: or is it secret
 eulerscheZahl: you have some switches that you can toggle. and lights are on or off

 Wontonimo: hey CarmeTheThird, try out the "multis" (aka Bot Programming) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Wontonimo: I like them a lot more than Clash of Code
 struct: also you probably will learn a bit more stuff
 struct: and no time limit
 n00bCod3r: How can I see the history of my clashes? 
 struct: notifications
 struct: the bell icon
 n00bCod3r: So if in one year I want to see the clash I ook today I have to scroll back o.o
 struct: you wont be able to see them anymore
 struct: it gets cleared
 Wontonimo: hopefully in a year you'll find the clashes too simple and have moved onto multis
 struct: I think i have played plenty of clashes
 struct: when i joined cg
 struct: 3815 clashes :grimacing:
 MSmits: think of how many boardgame leaderboards you could have wrecked in that time 
 struct: yeapa
 struct: dont make the same mistake I did
 struct: Now I can no longer play clashes, but at least I can do average bots on multis
 Joleaf: what for boardgame leaderboards?
 n00bCod3r: I don't plan on ending in any leaderboards anyway
 MSmits: the neverending noobcoder
 n00bCod3r: :sunglasses:
 struct: im not against clashes
 struct: but you can get a lot more from multis
 struct: imo
 Wontonimo: what do you mean Joleaf&#160;?
 struct: games like these Joleaf <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-4</a>
 struct: There are plenty of games
 n00bCod3r: How much does it take to learn async in JS?
 Joleaf: ah, thank you&#160;:)
 MSmits: whats async
 Wontonimo: 7.  it teaks 7 to learn async
 n00bCod3r: I spent almost 50 hours reading docs, reading tutorials, doing exercises and I still don't understand anything
 MSmits: 7 is less than 8 at least
 Wontonimo: yeah, and I'm grateful for that
 struct: MSmits its like a queue
 struct: your code keeps running while other function is pending
 struct: or w/e
 MSmits: oh that
 MSmits: like a workthread
 n00bCod3r: I'm reading playground 347 for the third time
 MSmits: is it any good
 MSmits: (dont spoil the ending)
 n00bCod3r: The explanation is really good, I just fatigue to understand it
 n00bCod3r: Struggle, not fatigue*
 MSmits: but it fatigues you
 Wontonimo: code it n00bCod3r.  play with the code locally.  tweak it, add log messages, but most importantly is to run the code in various versions
 Wontonimo: and from memory
 Wontonimo: dont' copy-paste it
 n00bCod3r: I don't usually do that
 Wontonimo: all the reading in the world won't make good at driving unless you actually get behind the wheel and practice.  Same with coding
 n00bCod3r: I know, I'm writing a script in Node that uses this stuff so I have to study it before 
 n00bCod3r: I even wrote a working code but idk why it works
 MSmits: it's magic
 n00bCod3r: .-. maybe
 emh: are there any exercises on implementing a lisp interpreter?
 emh: I want to code one in order to experiment with Levin universal search. but not today. another day
 Westicles: I think there is a clash for that
 emh: a clash? wow. hehe
 emh: I want to write it in C++. for speed
 Westicles: jk.  you can search here.  didn't see anything for those keywords
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 emh: ahh ok
 emh: I'm fasting today (with tomato juice). dinner at 6 PM. want to lose weight
 Wontonimo: the fasted way to lose weight is to shave your head
 emh: I do that. sometimes
 emh: hehe
 darkhorse64: it's working for everybody
 darkhorse64: it's not
 Wontonimo: but tomato juice has calories.  why not water?
 Wontonimo: heck, if you skip the water also you'll lose weight even faster
 emh: it's negligible amount of calories in tomato juice
 emh: and tastes good
 emh: I also put curry in the juice
 emh: powder
 Wontonimo: okay, i was with you until that last bit
 emh: hehe. also garlic pepper sometimes
 emh: tastes like food then
 MSmits: clip toenails as well
 MSmits: and use laxatives
 emh: do prunes count?
 MSmits: sure
 Wontonimo: I hear laying down in a bog will draw out all your bodily fluids if you stay still for at least 1 month.  Good way to lose 50 to 100 lbs
 emh: rad
 emh: maybe alligators will help too
 HiEv: Yeah, fastest way to lose weight is amputation.  :-P
 emh: my laptop upgraded itself to Windows 11. it's on the insider channel
 zsltg: @emh and how is it?
 AllYourTrees: Astrobytes idk what to do in breakthrough anymore
 struct: meanwhile im still on move generator functions
 struct: :D
 struct: You use mcts AllYourTrees?
 AllYourTrees: ya + solver
 AllYourTrees: idk how much the solver actually helped lol
 struct: random rollouts?
 AllYourTrees: ya
 struct: I heard that ept is better
 struct: or its random + ept?
 Astrobytes: Sorry was afk, yeah I'd figure out an eval and go EPT
 emh: zsltg it looks a bit different. didn't notice much else
 AllYourTrees: does ept require an eval fn?
 AllYourTrees: ahh
 jacek: do you have bitboards in bt?
 Wontonimo: ept?
 Astrobytes: MCTS with early playout termination
 Astrobytes: replace rollouts with an eval essentially
 Wontonimo: right
 jacek: do you have special cases for endgames i.e. player to move has pawn at 7th row so its a win? or non attacked pawn in 6th row then its almost win, etc. this way with few ifs you can check earlier win/loses, by 3-4 or sometimes 5 plies
 AllYourTrees: yep have bitboards, not sure if im using them optimally though
 AllYourTrees: interesting jacek i don't have special cases like that. all i have is force moves to stop a win and take winning moves
 AllYourTrees: can you almost do like a raycast where you shoot rays in front of a pawn and if there's no enemies there then you know its a win?
 AllYourTrees: except i guess itll have to be a bit operation
 jacek: i do that with ifs and bit operations
 jacek: i.e. frame 57 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/546068314">https://www.codingame.com/replay/546068314</a> black to move
 jacek: i know in this moment its a win for black - black can move into non-attacked square and also white hasnt similar pawn for his race to win. no need to do 2-3 plies search
 linjoehan: Does coding escape only have 3 public rooms?
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: hello
 jacek: ohai
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: rate yourself  from 1 to 10
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: in coding
 struct: 1
 clay53: 10
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: 3,87 
 BlaiseEbuth: coding coding coding coding coding coding coding coding coding coding
 Wontonimo: no
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 Wontonimo: what if there was more than 1 dimension to skill rating?  :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: Nice try. But I will not spam 'coding' ^^
 Wontonimo: speaking of which, I really like that CG has XP, CP, and the quest map of which there is only a small intersection between them.  Really kept me engaged
 Wontonimo: oh, i liked your response BlaiseEbuth&#160;!  +1
 BlaiseEbuth: :sunglasses:
 TipuTare: i got to bronze guyssssssss
 TipuTare: i dont know why it doesnt show u right after u did it
 KiwiTae: gg
 Aeglen: wish i found this 7 years afo
 jacek: hm?
 Wontonimo: yeah, me to Aeglen
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: yeah me too aeglen
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: i would be killing  this game right now
 BlaiseEbuth: I found it 7 years before
 jacek: and now youre a mod. what a downhill
 eulerscheZahl: i failed kotlin heroes again :sob:
 BlaiseEbuth: If I continue like this I will end working for CG... 
 jacek: you used java?
 eulerscheZahl: in an unpaid internship
 eulerscheZahl: no, i coded in kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: solved 6 tasks. need 7 for top50
 eulerscheZahl: or 6 with a faster time
 eulerscheZahl: and tourist "only" 2nd
 eulerscheZahl: solved everything but worse time than #1
 eulerscheZahl: even if he had all 10 done faster
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/finding-sherlock-coding-escape-community-event-on-july-7/191634">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/finding-sherlock-coding-escape-community-event-on-july-7/191634</a>not even as a real contest. there is hope to have bots in fall
 struct: escape event o.o
 jacek: escape from CG
 eulerscheZahl: did you submit on kotlin heroes struct?
 struct: no euler
 struct: I ended up not joining
 eulerscheZahl: now you can't anymore, registration is closed
 struct: im sure i could solve some problems
 struct: im doing breakthrough instead
 struct: like 1 line per 10 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: hard thinking or distracted coding?
 struct: distracted
 struct: was watching  the soccer game
 struct: germany is playing vs england
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr dropped to #3, now even his media thing is in danger
 eulerscheZahl: right, that soccer match. completely forgot
 eulerscheZahl: but it's raining heavily, can't use the empty park to my advantage
 struct: Does the cg escape have prizes?
 struct: might be the only way to win a shirt
 struct: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i know as much as you do
 eulerscheZahl: less than you if you click the registration link
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes struct wants to team up with you
 struct: team games during summer might not be a great call
 eulerscheZahl: oh, july 7th. I have my first soccer match this year on that day&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, not sure I'm up for it tbh
 eulerscheZahl: friendly's for a team that i usually don't play for. some church team. but hey, it's soccer
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 Astrobytes: getting back to some kind of normality at least
 struct: I should also start playing on thursday
 eulerscheZahl: my Austrian colleague even has to get back to office in 2 weeks
 eulerscheZahl: he doesn't even want to come back to office
 Astrobytes: I think there should be an option to remain fully or partially out of the office for most previously office-based positions tbh
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: this popout chat is great, thanks.
 eulerscheZahl: regarding kotlin:
 eulerscheZahl: " If two participants solved the same number of problems and scored the same penalty, then those of them who had previously made the last successful submission will be given an advantage in the distribution of prizes and gifts."
 eulerscheZahl: i'm screwed. same time as another player but worse in that tie
 BlaiseEbuth: A little basic cause that's the v2. Lost the v1... :3
 Astrobytes: hey, it does what it says on the tin, I'm happy
 eulerscheZahl: even with solving just 1 problem and then quitting i would have a bigger chance for random tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: i hate that mode
 eulerscheZahl: submitted something else for different penalty time :D
 eulerscheZahl: but not working, first solve counts&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: what pop out chat?
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGChat">https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGChat</a>
 Wontonimo: thanks
 HiEv: Wow.  Fixed one typo in my code and went from 34th place to 14th place.
 Wontonimo: which game HiEv?
 HiEv: Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe.
 HiEv: (Silver league)
 Wontonimo: Nice!
 Wontonimo: what algo are you using HiEv&#160;?
 HiEv: At this point it's mostly a "take the obvious moves, otherwise go randomly" algorithm, with a bunch of placeholders for code to make it smarter.  Does fairly well, considering.
 HiEv: I've been adding some "and avoid stupid moves" code now too.
 HiEv: I just started on it last night, so still early stages.
 Wontonimo: well, that's good placement for first early stages
 Wontonimo: really good
 Wontonimo: you don't even have a simulation?
 HiEv: It knows where to go to win and where to go to block, and prioritizes the meta-board wins, but that's about it so far.
 jacek: noice
 struct: smart rollouts with ept should work right?
 struct: for bt
 jacek: ept would work in any game
 jacek: provided you have not crappy ecal
 jacek: eval even
 HeroicSnowflake_ea2b: dexNod   
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: Hello 
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: anyone there 
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 BIPIN_THE_KIND: ok
 Xchel: hi
 KiwiTae: o/
 Joleaf: eulerschezahl dont run your django in debug mode&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes i will
 Joleaf: okay&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: it's all on github anyways, no hidden info you could extract
 <b>**dbdr sets panic mode on</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: the icpc contest?
 dbdr: y
 eulerscheZahl: i see the panic in your submit count going up
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't get the trip, at least you will "receive a story feature on ICPC social media channels."
 dbdr: whatever that means :D
 eulerscheZahl: they changed the description a few times. before the top players after each 24h should get a swag bag
 Astrobytes: :clap: got it right!
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Astrobytes: the swag bag
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: dbdr best of luck to you, that's way too close for comfort!
 dbdr: #1 has a nice lead
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but the difference to #2 is sooo near
 Xchel: 3+
 Astrobytes: from you I mean, not from #1
 eulerscheZahl: 25 is the smallest possible difference
 <b>**eulerscheZahl hates those useless constant factors</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: damn!
 eulerscheZahl: just divide everything by 25 and it's still the same order
 dbdr: I guess #2 or #3 does not matter much
 eulerscheZahl: who does this as a problem creator?
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: round numbers look better
 eulerscheZahl: 25 is not round
 eulerscheZahl: it's odd
 dbdr: it's because they halve some points
 dbdr: everything else is multiple of 10
 Astrobytes: round&#160;!= even
 dbdr: don't distract me from my spam submitting&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: round = multiple of Pi obviously
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: smits is not 1st in c4 eh
 Astrobytes: oh, nice job by robo, pretty close between them still though.
 Astrobytes: And I thought struct was done with c4? :P
 RoboStac: he keeps resubmitting because I push him down to far
 struct: yeah
 struct: the bot is the same
 Astrobytes: Ah :D
 struct: when I opened codingame i had like 40+ matches lost vs robo
 Astrobytes: Yes, I'm familiar with that feeling 
 Fatley: /me
 RoboStac: I can't seem to get a version that's good vs smits and fica at the same time. 
 Fatley: hello all
 Fatley: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: does fica also book?
 eulerscheZahl: just tell struct when you are done
 RoboStac: not that I'm aware of
 RoboStac: I've stopped for now as continuing that training didn't really seem to be improving
 Wontonimo: (ノಠ_ಠ)ノ彡 ┬──┬/me glues down table
 struct: yes this version seems better
 struct: I can no longer beat you even if I make my AI play worse
 RoboStac: yeah, it's definitely much better than the version from a few weeks ago
 RoboStac: just can't get conv networks to be fast enough
 YurkovAS: struct you have more rollouts than me in c4? can you check? i'm show in msg, first number.
 struct: yes
 struct: i have 3M rollouts per sec
 struct: on first turn
 struct: you seem to  have 2.2M right?
 YurkovAS: yes
 YurkovAS: you use 'horizontal and' in win check? my avx version is slower than standart.
 struct: yes
 struct: ah on win check
 struct: i use testz
 YurkovAS: struct and 4 avx instructions before "testz" in "horizontal and"?
 struct: i use the and on shifts and on the masks
 YurkovAS: thanks, i'm need more :thinking: about it or googling...
 struct: i use 2 shifts in total for win check
 struct: i saw some people use more
 YurkovAS: oh, i'm use 4 shifts + 3 and_clear_mask + havy "hor_and"
 AllYourTrees: RoboStac how did you fit the 63x3 -&gt; 256 -&gt; 16 weights in codingame? isn't that way above 100kb? 189*256 =48k floats = ~192k bytes
 Meghnatis: hey. anybody at the defibrillatorts problem atm? i need some help but not the solution
 Meghnatis: i don't want to goolge cause i dont want to see the answer yet. 
 darkhorse64: maybe he uses half floats or any form of quantization. Just a wild guess
 RoboStac: one utf-16 character per float (14 bit accuracy)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Meghnatis it's just math.  I did in in java because you need good precision for that one
 Invisible_Babayka: Meghnatis I did it several hours ago. Can you tell me more exactly what's the problem? 
 Invisible_Babayka: Guys, I'm curious about fall challenge 2021. Did anyone participate in previous ones? Was it fun? What you would do if enrolled? Is this some kind of clash of code week? 
 KiwiTae: lol
 jacek: clash of code as contest? :scream:
 KiwiTae: hope not :D
 jacek: previous contests were bot programming
 jacek: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021</a>

 struct: AllYourTrees how many rollouts did you have on breakthrough?
 Invisible_Babayka: Oh I see. Thank you jacek&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: think it was 500k struct iirc
 struct: in 1 sec right?
 SandmanSW96: thats a new one
 SandmanSW96: "you have reached the limited number of plays for a limited amount of time"
 jacek: Oo
 SandmanSW96: yeah in the spring challenge
 Astrobytes: I don't remember tbh struct
 SandmanSW96: i have never seen CG do that
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's annoying SandmanSW96, they lowered the threshold for max plays
 SandmanSW96: ugh
 SandmanSW96: whats the threshold?
 SandmanSW96: like time wise
 Astrobytes: I honestly don't remember off the top of my head
 Wontonimo: 5 min i thought
 SandmanSW96: k thanks though
 SandmanSW96: okay so i wait 5?
 Astrobytes: there are minutes, hours and daily thresholds
 struct: after that messages show
 Wontonimo: then there is another limit at something like 30 min
 Wontonimo: then 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours ,etc
 struct: o.o
 SandmanSW96: but there is a 5 min one too?
 Wontonimo: i think so
 SandmanSW96: k
 SandmanSW96: i will give it 5
 Wontonimo: very much like twitter api thresholds
 struct: just press play my code less often I guess
 Wontonimo: and other such services
 Astrobytes: yeah, n amount of plays in 5 minutes
 Astrobytes: Submit more! Oh...
 SandmanSW96: hard to get your head around the task if you get shut out
 struct: you can do like 700 battles in 24 hours I think
 struct: its harsh
 Wontonimo: think more, submit less, test locally
 SandmanSW96: i am just replaying same circumstances
 SandmanSW96: still trying to beat the ai myself so i can figure out the right code for it
 struct: just submit and hope rng makes you win
 SandmanSW96: been putting moves in manually
 Wontonimo: did you know you can view previous battles without having to rerun them?
 SandmanSW96: oh  yeah
 SandmanSW96: i do that when i  lose to like only a handful of ppl
 SandmanSW96: watch all of them to see what went wrong.  good for bug hunting
 Wontonimo: you can also review other peoples battles
 SandmanSW96: ugh k i am gonna give this thing 5 and try again later
 Astrobytes: Get some water/coffee/whatever, take a small walk, come back refreshed
 Astrobytes: And yeah. Test locally.
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FweAZfgZMvw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FweAZfgZMvw</a>
 Astrobytes: ah I know that one
 AlexWord: will artificial intelligence take away the work of programmers?
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: oh, i know that problem
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Astrobytes: And no to your question.
 AlexWord: Saw the merge of gpt-3 and github
 Astrobytes: I think it'll be useful more as a tool than a threat
 BlaiseEbuth: Can be useful as threat too :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: *employment threat
 BlaiseEbuth: Speaking music Astrobytes, have you ever seen these little dudes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ7_1KN6aXY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ7_1KN6aXY</a>

 Xbiot: hello
 Astrobytes: Impressive BlaiseEbuth! I hadn't seen that. Top quality cover!
 BlaiseEbuth: They made a few, they're pretty good. Well raised kids ^^
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure. Those kids can play! (and sing!)
 BlaiseEbuth: Make 4-5 kids -&gt; Train them hard -&gt; become producer -&gt; big ROI :money_mouth:
 Astrobytes: Damn straight!
 jacek: making 4-5 NNs is cheap though
 Astrobytes: NNs won't sing like that young lassie
 Astrobytes: They kinda scare me in that 'Hanson' kinda way. But they are very good.
 MSmits: why are you afraid of a band?
 MSmits: weirdest phobia
 Astrobytes: Do you actually remember Hanson?
 MSmits: yeah those 3 girls that turned out to be guys
 jacek: traps?
 BlaiseEbuth: Jim?
 Astrobytes: MmmBop &lt;shudder&gt;
 MSmits: I remember mostly because 1 of my friends was really into one of the "girls" 
 Astrobytes: I don't actually have a phobia, but there is definitely some Hanson overlap going on here (admittedly with girls and boys but still...)
 Astrobytes: MSmits: you cannot be serious
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: was a nice surprise for him
 BlaiseEbuth: How did he get inside&#160;?
 Astrobytes: wtf :rofl:
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth lol
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: This only happened when he first saw them right?
 MSmits: he just beat you to it jacek
 MSmits: i think within a week of first seeing them maybe
 antidude900: brr
 Astrobytes: OK. But still :D
 MSmits: yeah it was funny
 antidude900: maan this battke is taking too much time my battery gonna die
 Astrobytes: you don't have to watch all your submits
 Brejchys: heyeyey
 Brejchys: i can win 
 antidude900: still though i dont have to wtach i have to wait&gt;
 antidude900:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 Astrobytes: You can't plug in?
 antidude900: no
 Astrobytes: damn, well, better preserve what battery you have left
 Astrobytes: sorry&#160;:/
 antidude900: the boss 3 is invincible
 Wontonimo: what game antidude900&#160;?
 antidude900: does programming lanuage also matter with the spedd in which our bot is moving?
 Astrobytes: Coders Strike Back I'm guessing
 Wontonimo: prbly
 antidude900: yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, python's bot are limited in speed
 antidude900: fck
 Wontonimo: he's kidding
 Seto_Kibah: Python: Quick to make, slow to process
 antidude900: but i have hear that python are slow in ececuting than c+
 BlaiseEbuth: Java ones are a little faster but can explode at any moment
 Seto_Kibah: That's what my mother said about me, except quick to birth, and slow to love..... *sobs*
 Wontonimo: tmi
 Seto_Kibah: Sorry, just Python reminds me of my mother
 BlaiseEbuth: The scales I guess
 Wontonimo: (¬_¬)
 MSmits: lol!
 Astrobytes: hah!
 MSmits: best yo momma joke
 struct: finally made the getmoves function
 struct: time to rest for the rest of the week
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth wins CG chat for today
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah&#160;! \o/
 Wontonimo: :taco:
 Wontonimo: hey antidude900, what are you making your bot do?
 Astrobytes: struct: why do I not believe you when you say that :D
 struct: I did astro
 struct: took me a while because it was very slow at first
 Astrobytes: I meant the resting part :D
 struct: ah
 struct: :p
 struct: it should take me a while anyways to make a bot for it
 Astrobytes: I made mine a while ago, bug fixing and tuning past few days. Still no TT, been working on eval mostly
 struct: why TT?
 struct: you use minimax?
 Astrobytes: I'm alphabeta always to start with
 struct: ah, i usually start with mcts
 struct: its mostly copy paste from my other multis
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I could do that but I'm masochistic
 Astrobytes: Plus, good alphabeta == good EPT
 struct: maybe I can try minimax
 struct: Long time since i tried it
 Astrobytes: I have some kind of null window type thing going on already but been focusing on the eval before adding extras
 Wontonimo: there's an improvement to alpha beta <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>

 Astrobytes: You fell for it or something else?
 struct: yes and it auto played for some reaosn
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: I randomly clicked it without meaning to&#160;:(
 MSmits: i was just closing some tabs and lost control of the mouse
 Astrobytes: Lost control of the mouse... that's the best one I've heard yet!
 MSmits: well once you get older, all this tech becomes harder to control
 Astrobytes: You're only a year older than me!
 MSmits: well, I guess that means more rick astley in your future
 Astrobytes: Hehehe, well played
 MSmits: I'm not messing though, i tried to grab the mouse and missed somehow, just tired 
 MSmits: then i heard rick
 Astrobytes: It happens
 MSmits: yup
 Astrobytes: My keyboard is playing up again, got it at a funny angle from the usual. Might need a couple of new switches
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: my fence is coming tomororw
 MSmits: hope i got all the tree roots
 MSmits: or those guys are going to have trouble digging :P
 Astrobytes: Ah, well, you're gonna find out :D
 Astrobytes: Or they are lol
 MSmits: yeah it was my job to deliver the ground "rootless"
 MSmits: but I guess they'll be ok running into one root. otherwise i'll get my axe and help
 Astrobytes: I am fairly sure, given your thorough nature,  that the ground is rootless :P
 MSmits: well the panels all go 1 foot deep
 MSmits: but the poles 70 cm. I think
 MSmits: mixing systems here
 MSmits: i checked everything to 1 foot
 MSmits: so the poles might hit some 
 Astrobytes: hehe unfortunately I understand
 MSmits: not you jacek, i mean fence poles
 MSmits: you gotta preempt jacek
 MSmits: otherwise he's gonna go off
 Astrobytes: If you've whacked off enough root though, just the hammering of the *posts* might be enough to punch downwards without trouble
 MSmits: oh right, i hope so
 MSmits: some of these roots have a huge diameter though
 MSmits: it's like right next to where the tree was
 Astrobytes: You have no choice now but to leave this as an exercise to the worker :P
 MSmits: i guess so
 MSmits: i worked on this 1-2 hrs a day for a month
 Astrobytes: I remember you saying yeah
 MSmits: i physically changed. My hands had many wounds at first
 Astrobytes: Sometimes a little more now and then
 MSmits: from handling the damn axe, even with gloves
 MSmits: not used to the pressure
 Astrobytes: yeah. Blisters on your blisters and all that. Once you push through that and get some callouses going it's fine.
 MSmits: yeah it was ok after a week or two
 Wontonimo: i'm glad i could add some *joy* to the end of your day
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: it's not even a bad song
 Astrobytes: lol, right
 Astrobytes: Well, it was alright at the time. I liked it as a kid.
 MSmits: yeah
 Wontonimo: "i physically changed.  my hands had many wounds at first"  sounds like a passage from a scifi fan fiction
 MSmits: i saw him at graham norton discussing the meme
 MSmits: yes, like that movie annihilation
 MSmits: i will turn into a tree now
 Astrobytes: :o
 MSmits: i liked that movie, watch it if you havent
 MSmits: netflix i think
 MSmits: one of the first big streaming only movies i think, pre-pandemic
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I remember you recommended it. It's on my list I believe
 MSmits: oh ok
 Astrobytes: Superb concept
 Wontonimo: i have not seen Annihilation.  i'll add it to the list
 Wontonimo: is it like "The colour of space"&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, it's not perfect, but it's one of those movies that sticks with you after you've seen it, you'll think about it from time to time and will rewatch it at some point
 MSmits: dont remember colour of space
 Wontonimo: everything starts to mutate
 MSmits: oh
 Wontonimo: and merge with other things
 MSmits: well there's some of that I guess
 Wontonimo: so a cow and a goat get too close and become a two headed crazed beast
 Wontonimo: the wife gets too close to some spiders and well ... you get the idea
 MSmits: the movie is a bit more subtle than that, but things do change
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's soooort of similar to the concept of Annihilation
 Astrobytes: Do you mean Color Out of Space Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: yeah, probably
 MSmits: is this a really old movie?
 Wontonimo: let me gogl it
 MSmits: it sounds like a movie i  could not have missed
 MSmits: if it was new enough
 Astrobytes: Also, props for writing 'colour' not 'color' - I like that&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yes, that's the one Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Seems interesting!
 Wontonimo: well, i'm in Canada, we are okay with vowels and didn't go through a dumbing down of the language like our southern neighbour
 g0dfvth3r: shots fired
 Wontonimo: vowels aren't scarry
 Astrobytes: heh :D
 MSmits: 2019!
 Astrobytes: Go Go Canuck Cannon :D
 MSmits: it's even got a &gt;6 imdb rating
 Astrobytes: I spend a lot of time online with Canadians
 MSmits: which means it's watchable!
 MSmits: wait how do i see this movie
 Astrobytes: hehe you're standards are as low as mine
 Wontonimo: for the interest in why American English is missing vowels , here is a good read <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://qz.com/596395/the-case-of-the-missing-us-in-american-english/">https://qz.com/596395/the-case-of-the-missing-us-in-american-english/</a>
 Wontonimo: it's not mean about it.  I was mean about it.  the article is informative
 MSmits: wimmen
 MSmits: this makes more sense
 Astrobytes: *your not you're, wtf me
 MSmits: thats a bad idea
 Wontonimo: language is always changing.  all i have to do is listen to my kids and realize that in 2 generations I'll understand nothing
 Astrobytes: Yes, well look back at some ye olde Englishe texts
 Astrobytes: Right
 MSmits: Wontonimo they'll change their language to conform to society partially
 Wontonimo: for this reason i have huge issues with time travel movies
 MSmits: so the change is more gradual than you think
 Astrobytes: Esc-U-lator and mischiev-i-ous are now things
 MSmits: riiight, *that* is the main issue with time travel movies :P
 Wontonimo: i mean, i like time travel movies, but i cannot suspend my disbelief 
 Wontonimo: it is, otherwise it is totally real MSmits
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: my problem is that they are never consistent
 Wontonimo: no they are not.
 MSmits: i have no problem if they use some system for it, theres different ways to go about it, but be consistent
 Wontonimo: i like the idea of only being able to send your ideas back
 Astrobytes: Such is the nature of time travel!
 Wontonimo: not anything physical
 MSmits: still have to deal with paradoxes
 Wontonimo: if you send something back, but the earth has moved, do you just appear in space?
 MSmits: either with alternate reality or self-prohibiting paradoxes
 Wontonimo: it's just silly
 Wontonimo: silly like Dungeons and Dragons and Star Trek.  but i like them all
 Astrobytes: I kinda liked some of the stuff in what was that movie.... Intersellar
 Astrobytes: *Interstellar
 Marchete: I like that movie
 MSmits: I disliked 1 part of interstellar, but i realize why they did it
 Astrobytes: which part
 MSmits: they enormously exaggerated the time slowing effect
 Wontonimo: really, in star trek you have a replicator and a teleporter, can you just replicate and teleport any repairs you need to your ship into its exact place 
 Wontonimo: really, it's silly
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's fair
 MSmits: if time slowed as much as it did on that planet, you would be almost stuck on the event horizon
 Wontonimo: not a lot of events happening on that horizon
 Astrobytes: Yes. That would be an altogether very different movie
 Wontonimo: what was it, 1 wave?
 MSmits: yeah not much happened, but if there is enough room for a whole planet, you're already too far from the black hole
 Wontonimo: the reality is that space is really boring, until you are about to die then it is terrifying.  Nothing exciting about it.
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: re start trek, I think you need a signal for the transporter to lock on to, might be tricky in some circumstances
 MSmits: space is yeah, the things in space arent&#160;:)
 Marchete: "the reality is that space is really boring," you must be kidding
 Astrobytes: It's FULL of dangerous radiation and objects of interest!
 Wontonimo: i find space fascinating!  Flying to mars for 8 months in a tin can smaller than my bedroom would be boring
 Astrobytes: What's not to love? :D
 MSmits: well it's mostly empty
 Astrobytes: 'empty'
 Marchete: with "infinite speed" it must be really cool to visit
 MSmits: well both full and empty are a bit hard to define here&#160;:)
 Marchete: all stars and that
 Astrobytes: I mean, yes, it is 'space' - but it's hidden space that's a lot of fun&#160;:)
 MSmits: hidden space?
 Astrobytes: things in 'space' we cannot see :P
 MSmits: sounds like a secret mancave tbh
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Wontonimo: There is a serious lack of pizza restaurants in space
 Astrobytes: So THAT's what dark matter is
 MSmits: sure :P
 MSmits: I dont like pizza :P
 Wontonimo: but i do love researching and learning about space
 MSmits: in fact i'd do great in space, nutrition-wise, I already basically live on space-food :P
 Wontonimo: excellent
 Astrobytes: Me too. I try to distance myself from everything and everyone at all times. 
 Astrobytes: I'm literally a Space Man
 Wontonimo: you can join Musk on his mars colonization  
 Astrobytes: (sorry :D )
 Wontonimo: i'm kidding
 MSmits: I had a very weird scifi dream the other day where black holes appeared in the sky over a planet
 Wontonimo: nice
 MSmits: i was pretty shaken when i woke up
 Wontonimo: what happened?
 Astrobytes: Good lord. Imagine being stuck on Mars with Elon Musk
 Wontonimo: lol
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 Wontonimo: lol 2 that also
 Wontonimo: okay, gotta go pick up the pizza i ordered
 MSmits: and then i realized it made no sense because the holes would have fallen into the center of the planets and the dream made no sense. That gave me a sense of relief somehow
 Astrobytes: I always have these kind of weird dreams, either action scifi, or horror-scifi
 Wontonimo: it could have been orbiting in geo - stationary 
 MSmits: well it was pretty close to the surface
 MSmits: but sure, good point
 Astrobytes: Yeah but the beauty of dreams is the impossibility!
 MSmits: i literally had conversations with people explaining to them the hole didnt just look cool but would suck up all the atmosphere and they'd choke to dead
 Astrobytes: (actual dreams I mean, not #lifegoals dreams)
 MSmits: in my dream i was smits-splaning
 MSmits: splaining
 Astrobytes: Hahaha. Sermons all dream-long
 MSmits: yeah, as i said, weird dream :P
 MSmits: unsettling
 MSmits: cant call it a nightmare though
 Astrobytes: If my dreams are not weird I regard it as unusual
 kosmas12: If my dreams are not weird then something's off
 MSmits: yeah but in my case i dont usually remember them
 kosmas12: Hello I'm new here
 MSmits: and also, they are not so scientifically accurate
 Astrobytes: I've had crazy vivid and pretty exciting dreams since I can remember
 MSmits: kosmas12 hi
 kosmas12: Hello
 MSmits: I can usually guess why i dreamed something and relate it to something i was doing the last day
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Dreams are not supposed to be scientifically accurate. I defy physics in many :D
 MSmits: but the black hole thing came outta nowhere
 MSmits: Astrobytes i know thats why it was weird
 Astrobytes: hi kosmas12
 kosmas12: I have nightmares more commonly than science-defying dreams
 MSmits: maybe my subconscious is protesting that i am stopping the physics teaching
 kosmas12: That's not often, but last time I saw a nightmare I was devastated for a whole month and it still affects me a little bit lol
 Marchete: are you on vacation, MSmits?
 Astrobytes: I do dream about code and stuff, algorithms, eval functions etc now and then too, usually followed up by some kind of alien invasion dream
 MSmits: Marchete yes and no. This week just grading stuff, next week mostly meetings at work and then it's summer vacation
 kosmas12: I rarely see dreams with code, but when I do, they usually hold the solution to a problem that's been troubling me for a long time
 Marchete: lucky you
 Marchete: 2 full months?
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, mostly i feel relieved my studies are done
 MSmits: well if you count these 2 weeks as vacation then yes 2
 MSmits: but it's officially 6 weeks off
 Astrobytes: kosmas12: yeah, in an abstract way for me though
 struct: nice
 MSmits: I always do somewhere between 3 days and 2 weeks of work during summer vacation
 MSmits: dont have so much this time though
 MSmits: kosmas12 i had dreams of code during some contests
 MSmits: i woke up with a function in my mind and ran to the pc
 Astrobytes: right, I'm leaving my BT where it is right now for now. Right between euler and darkhorse. 26th.
 kosmas12: I've never taken part in coding contests
 MSmits: we have them twice a year now
 MSmits: here
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I usually write it on a notepad near my bed.
 kosmas12: I feel like I'd lose if I did due to how my creative/algorithmic thinking skills are usually non existent lol
 Astrobytes: Or get up early.
 MSmits: yeah thats probably smarter, but my pc is quite close to the bed
 Astrobytes: So is mine admittedly
 MSmits: kosmas12 there is a whole range between winning and losing. There's usually 7k registered players these days
 MSmits: you dont have to be 1st&#160;:)
 MSmits: I never have anyways
 kosmas12: Indeed but I'd definitely be close to last place
 Astrobytes: kosmas12 you can learn a whoooole lot of stuff just participating
 MSmits: doubt that
 MSmits: it really doesnt take much more than basic programming and persistence to get to the top half
 MSmits: that should be doable in 11 days
 kosmas12: Well I've been coding in C for a year, walked into the kernel realm, done some basic game dev, generally done lots of stuff
 kosmas12: Does that seem eligible enough?
 MSmits: then you'd be fine
 Astrobytes: 100%
 MSmits: sounds like CG is a good fit for you
 MSmits: thats right about where it's comfortable to start
 kosmas12: CG = CodinGame?
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: kernel code? then yes 
 MSmits: i think you're about as educated on coding as i was when i got here. Having done a bunch of random stuff
 kosmas12: Most of the programming I've done is actually kernel level (see the first thing I ever did was make homebrew for the original Xbox, and stuff runs on kernel mode there)
 Astrobytes: You did kernel stuff too MSmits?
 Marchete: unrelated: I managed to get a top5 like oware bot with 40min of training, from scratch
 MSmits: i experimented with compute shaders, modded/scripted for games and i did a lot of VBA for work
 MSmits: oh and stuff in unity (hence the compute shaders)
 kosmas12: I was reading a book about learning C# today and received an email from CodinGame and was like "Hey I should probably get into it, I want to improve my thinking"
 Astrobytes: Oh I remember your shader fun
 kosmas12: I didn't even know this thing had a chat, so that's even better
 Astrobytes: For algorithms and stuff you're in the right place
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: chat is source nº1 for learning
 MSmits: kosmas12 you can use many languages here
 Marchete: trust us
 kosmas12: I've had the account for a while now but rarely touched it
 Astrobytes: +1 Marchete
 MSmits: chat can get fairly random, but if you have an interesting question you can steer it your way pretty easily&#160;:)
 kosmas12: Yeah the XboxDev Discord server is how I learnt lots of stuff
 Astrobytes: We also have a discord
 kosmas12: I saw it and joined
 Marchete: chat goes from potato salad to the highest search algorithm in seconds
 Astrobytes: oh nice one
 Astrobytes: Marchete :rofl: so true
 kosmas12: I can definitely see that happening hehe
 MSmits: kosmas12 what would you like to do on CG? There is a lot
 kosmas12: I mean this is a coding platform after all
 kosmas12: I want to learn about data structures and stuff, I know certain languages to a very good level but never touched anything of the sort
 MSmits: I think the most unique part of CG is the emphasis on AI
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: but tons of puzzles here too
 kosmas12: Also fun fact I'm here at 1:37AM lol
 MSmits: ahh yes, 1 hour in the future
 kosmas12: We have flying cars, it's great
 Astrobytes: 23.38 here
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: backward country eh?
 Astrobytes: I couldn't say it any better myself MSmits :D
 MSmits: for some reason I have been rewatching some hitchens debates
 Astrobytes: kosmas12: as long as you're prepared to put in the effort to learn this website will serve you well
 MSmits: so been seeing lots of English stuff
 kosmas12: I'm looking forward to being part of this community, you seem like good people and the website indeed looks promising
 Astrobytes: Christopher &gt; Peter; Though I would argue hard with both MSmits :D
 MSmits: cool, welcome kosmas12
 kosmas12: Thank you
 LeviathanProgramming: Yeah.  I love the UI and I'm addicted to CoC now, kosmas12.
 MSmits: yeah I meant *the* hitch
 Marchete: step 1, pick an avatar
 Astrobytes: Turning into squiddy there Marchete :D
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 kosmas12: Anyway going to sleep now
 Astrobytes: And yeah, welcome kosmas12
 kosmas12: Goodnight my friends
 Astrobytes: goodnight!
 MSmits: gn, I am too. 
 MSmits: early day tomorrow. Gotta watch the poles go in
 Astrobytes: think I'll do one too
 Astrobytes: Up at 6 or 7
 MSmits: something like that
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: goodnight all
 MSmits: gn
 Astrobytes: oh - Marchete: what is your Breakthrough bot?
 struct: gn
 Marchete: I can't even remember, probably some minimax
 struct: do you prune moves at all on bt?
 struct: there are many moves
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 Marchete: yes
 Astrobytes: Not enough currently but yeah
 Astrobytes: anyway, take care all
 Astrobytes: gn
 struct: cya and gn
 LeviathanProgramming: dead chat&#160;:(
 struct: its normal at this time
 struct: most users are european
 struct: I think
 LeviathanProgramming: I'm american.
 LeviathanProgramming: I've been doing CoC all day almost

 Marchete: it's not looking bad
 Marchete: 1 hour training
 struct: wow
 struct: nice
 Marchete: from newbie to master in 1 single hour
 struct: very good job Marchete
 Marchete: it's still at 50% submit
 Marchete: but it's nice that it learned that fast
 struct: what score was it before?
 Marchete: 4th-6th
 Marchete: so not much difference
 Marchete: but I wasn't able to train that fast
 Marchete: damn now I get a lot of losses&#160;:)
 Marchete: but well
 Marchete: nvm
 struct: its not a big difference in rank
 struct: but its a big difference in elo
 Marchete: i'd say +1.5 
 Marchete: or maybe 2.0 improvement
 Marchete: naah
 Marchete: it was just a lucky submit :S
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: sleep time then
 Marchete: good night struct
 struct: gn
 cViper971: how do i remove the .0 when doing floor function
 Wontonimo: int()
 cViper971: its giving a syntax error
 cViper971: int(Math.floor(num))
 cViper971: is what i tried
 TwilightSnowflake_d0e3: did you add&#160;; after that line?
 cViper971: i had to do (int)(Math.floor(num))
 cViper971: i was using java
 Evilc6: ah yes
 Evilc6: java you have to use explicit type casting
 cViper971: is it possible to see the input for test cases
 Sprinklator: Just print them out after you read them

 BlackGriffin03: In Horse-Racing Duals , shouldn't the second test case answer be 2 because 17 &amp; 15, is the closet strength with minimum strength difference
 BlackGriffin03: But the correct answer according to the test seems to be 1 .How is is it possible&#160;??? 
 eulerscheZahl: because there is a horse with 6 and one with 7
 eulerscheZahl: and some more pairs with distance 1
 BlackGriffin03: okay :thumbs_up:
 Queen29: I donâ€™t understand this stuff.
 CarrotCode: hi
 KiwiTae: o/
 tealfrog: How does Edit option in CoC puzzle approval work? Is it like a suggested changes?
 Batfly: One question about C++&#160;: why " int h = list[ i ]&#160;; " don't work&#160;?
 Batfly: list is... a std::list&lt;int&gt; I created
 Batfly: (Oh, and I forget to say&#160;: Hi ^^" )
 KiwiTae: Batfly use std::vector instead
 KiwiTae: u can't access list element like that
 Batfly: oh, ok, that's work ^^ thanks
 Batfly: (Still, why using list if vector work better&#160;? :s )
 RoboStac: list is a linked list so you can insert / remove elements in the middle very quickly but indexing to elements is slow. Vector is a dynamic array so can only add / remove elements at the end quickly but indexing is very quick
 Batfly: okey, so it's just a question of convenient speed . Thanks ^^
 HornedRabbit: Hi everyone. I have a question about  Racing Duals optimization thing. I'm relatively new and I really don't have an idea for how to sort out this massive list without timng out...
 derjack: you said it yourself
 derjack: 'sort'
 HornedRabbit: Well. Any sorting i try to do still results in timing out...
 SlayerOfTheBad: What sorting algorithm are you using?
 HornedRabbit: I tried "quick sort", but I figure it's not a right solution gere.
 HornedRabbit: Or maybe i just screwed the implementation...
 derjack: what language
 SlayerOfTheBad: Probably that second one, implementing sortin galgorithms can be tricky.
 SlayerOfTheBad: Yeah what language.
 derjack: and do you still have nested for loops
 HornedRabbit: yep...
 derjack: once sorted, no need for that
 derjack: you can compare horse and horse+1 in single loop
 SlayerOfTheBad: You could try merge sort if you're comfortable with recursion.
 HornedRabbit: Thanks. I'll try to work more with the sorting and possibly get back once i get somewhere.
 SlayerOfTheBad: Good luck.&#160;:)
 akhil2310: hi
 Uljahn: use built-in sort
 Uljahn: oh, chat froze
 SlayerOfTheBad: If the language has it available.
 Uljahn: which language does not have it?
 SlayerOfTheBad: C, Haskell
 SlayerOfTheBad: Far as I'm aware at least.
 HornedRabbit: thanks Slayer. Merge sort did it. Now I'll try a few more things to take it apart and understand it better.
 SlayerOfTheBad: Glad to hear it.:)
 SlayerOfTheBad: Glad to hear it.&#160;:)
 SlayerOfTheBad: Oh, no editing, only repeat messages huh? good to know.
 derjack: oO
 Jothegeier: hello
 Vortakis: heeey devcs
 Vortakis: fellow devs
 Illedan: Hi
 Wontonimo: roll-over seems like it is fixed, or is it? :unamused: still cutting off when near the bottom or edge
 Wontonimo: hello fellow devs to you too Vortakis and Jothegeier
 Xaniouks: Hi guys, is there a way to do some profiling on the code to see what the worst parts are?
 ansh10121012: hello boys;
 Astrobytes: he has or had a bot in bronze, so I guess yes
 Astrobytes: bronze, what am I on about
 Astrobytes: don't listen to me, but I think so yes
 darkhorse64: ironically, the sogeti challenge has been highly beneficial to my FB ranking (#42 to #23) but I believe the top has improved even more their eval
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey there.
 BlaiseEbuth: Speaking sogeti, how do you discretize the possibles actions&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Eval&#160;? What algo&#160;?
 darkhorse64: To be fairly honest, my code is based on Magus sim/GA and pb4 eval with various performance improvements
 Magus: yeah my code is alsed based on Magus sim/GA
 Magus: *also
 darkhorse64: but much more improved
 BlaiseEbuth: I thought about ga too... But someone spoke about mcts, and I really don't see how to discretize enough...
 Illedan: ga ftw
 darkhorse64: You could discretize the same way you do for a GA but the branching would be overkill
 darkhorse64: afk for a while
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway, no matter the algo, it's a little utopian to imagine I'll get it working before contest end. :p
 AllYourTrees: woohoo top 10 in C4! :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: Top 10 on 11 players? :o gg!
 AllYourTrees: :sob:
 BlaiseEbuth: Na... 298! gg AllYourTop
 AllYourTrees: ty Blaise :P
 ProCoder03: what's C4&#160;??:thinking:
 ZarthaxX: connect 4
 BlaiseEbuth: :bomb:
 ZarthaxX: or that :P
 ProCoder03: thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: Wut. CG put my arm to uppercase! :scream:
 stuxen: yo
 KiwiCoder69: new to python and i just beat power of thor! :smile:
 ProCoder03: I fail in temperature code golf validator 1 &amp; 12 , is it a problem with size of code
 darkhorse64: No, your golfed code does not provde a valid answer
 KiwiTae: KiwiCoder69 o/ are you a fan?hehe
 KiwiCoder69:&#160;?
 KiwiCoder69:&#160;?
 KiwiTae: because we both kiwis
 ProCoder03: :thumbs_up:
 ProCoder03: darkhorse34
 LazyMammal: @ProCoder03 it could also be slow server (if it is a timeout).  retry and see if the same test cases fail
 ProCoder03: Actually now, it seems the servers are all heavy because every validator execpt for third is failing 
 MSmits: err temperatures requires no heavy calculation I think?
 MSmits: my meta mcts for oware with 36 seed endgame book is functional btw
 MSmits: now I need to wait a while to get enough data
 MSmits: assuming i don't run into more bugs. This stuff is hard
 MSmits: earlier i ran into a problem where my windows forms text box was updating too much because games run so fast
 MSmits: led to crashes. 
 reCurse: You should stick your computation stuff to a console app
 reCurse: UI is sometimes a bottleneck
 MSmits: that's a really good idea
 MSmits: I might do that once I am sure there are no more bugs
 MSmits: the ui makes it easier to spot them
 MSmits: what confuses me a bit is that I have a 10 core cpu and if I run 10 games at the same time, they all use 6.7% of the total cpu. So 67% of core so to speak. I know cores and threads are different things, but it always seems to be 6.7% somehow
 MSmits: thats what the task manager tells me anyway, no idea how accurate that even is
 MSmits: maybe it's hyperthreading or something that accounts for the lower cpu use
 MSmits: or the UI is just bottlenecking things hard like you said...
 derjack: 6.7% for 10 threads? theres some (i/o?) bottleneck for sure
 MSmits: per thread
 MSmits: so 67% of total cpu
 MSmits: "wasting"  a third
 eulerscheZahl: wasting 2 thrids
 MSmits: but possibly not, as i dont know for sure why this is the case
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: you know what i mean :P
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 eulerscheZahl: your constant chatting made me take a quick look at dots and boxes btw
 MSmits: oh cool
 eulerscheZahl: i won't go into that rabbit hole
 MSmits: no it's really something else
 eulerscheZahl: and my eyes hurt with that black background and yellow dots
 MSmits: thats what re curse said
 MSmits: didnt bother me too much
 eulerscheZahl: maybe your screen isn't good enough to show the black properly
 MSmits: who knows, maybe&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: UI rule: never use #000000 for black
 MSmits: why is that
 MSmits: too much contrast?
 eulerscheZahl: at least not for bigger areas
 eulerscheZahl: hard for the eyes when you look at it for a while
 MSmits: mmh ok
 jacek: thats racist
 MSmits: well I dont often look at those replays anyway, I was mostly coding and looking at my own pretty map outputs
 jacek: MSmits have you seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/abalone">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/abalone</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a hex board
 MSmits: i've seen yeah
 MSmits: only 5 players so far
 eulerscheZahl: and the start setup where wikipedia suggests it's prone to passive gameplay
 jacek: you can be top10 easily
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: thanks jacek
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl you mean he should have gone with a different setup?
 jacek: passive opening
 MSmits: what does that mean?
 eulerscheZahl: there are different ways to arrange the spheres at the start of the game
 MSmits: right
 jacek: inactive opening
 MSmits: I guess i dont know how to define "active" in this game
 eulerscheZahl: i read a bit about it because one day i considered porting that game too. decided against partially because of that possibly passive gameplay
 MSmits: a jrke just appeared on that leaderboard
 jrke: yes
 jacek: so lets make meta mcts
 jrke: random.choice(moves)
 MSmits: no thanks, i need my cpu for my oware NN data generation 
 MSmits: and later for training i suppose
 MSmits: jrke random moves are better than bad moves
 eulerscheZahl: is it me or does the leaderboard only show the first player? and load the rest when you scroll
 MSmits: happens to me all the time
 MSmits: also sometimes if you wait
 MSmits: instead of scrolling
 Illedan: Same for me euler
 eulerscheZahl: i'm inpatient
 eulerscheZahl: ah, there it loaded without scrolling
 MSmits: in which hospital?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: is that bug reported already?
 MSmits: i havent 
 <b>**eulerscheZahl uses Chromium. When I say that, they close the issue right away (only firefox + chrome are supported)</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I see
 MSmits: well make the bug report and says msmits and illedan have the same issue on chrome
 jacek: try ie
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 eulerscheZahl: i try to write a slightly more detailed bug report
 eulerscheZahl: "When opening a leaderboard, only the first player will be shown. The rest are rendered when scrolling or waiting a few seconds only."
 eulerscheZahl: illedan: "Leaderboards only load the first player."
 Astrobytes: Minimalist! :P
 jacek: jacek: "not enough ponies"
 eulerscheZahl: he was faster
 eulerscheZahl: now i won't report
 Illedan: Maybe I can shorten to "Leaderboards"?
 Astrobytes: LB
 Illedan: BUG
 eulerscheZahl: "fix whatever the hell is broken"
 MSmits: or just: :bug:
 Astrobytes: Just&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: and illedan reacted with :plus: to his own bug report :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: good, reinforce that
 jacek: now add the eyes
 Illedan: So you didn't have to find the proper emoji
 Illedan: You clicked it instantly
 Illedan: #win
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i accidentally react with plug instead of plus
 Illedan: Fixed
 jrke: so a laptop confirmed for pb 4
 eulerscheZahl: wait if dapowill join
 Astrobytes: dapowill? His brother? :P
 eulerscheZahl: missing space
 Astrobytes: You don't say!
 jrke: how much time is left for that contest?
 Astrobytes: ~5.5 hours
 jrke: oh
 Astrobytes: ~5.0 hours my bad
 Illedan: Code wont climb up again&#160;:( juli is harder to beat now -.-
 Victor_Baron: Heya
 JHowell: How can I see how many non-private clashes I've done? I got the 50-clash quest (a lot of them were private) but I still can't approve/reject clash contributions.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you have 27
 JHowell: Thanks!
 jrke: btw i have made a clash bot its working should i report this to someone?
 eulerscheZahl: why report it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Burn him!
 eulerscheZahl: it's known to be possible. that's why captchas got added
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah of course...
 Astrobytes: Just don't use it.
 eulerscheZahl: +
 jrke: captchas are now bit rare event as far as i discovered in clashes till now
 jrke: yeah i won't
 eulerscheZahl: tradeoff between stopping bots and not annoying human players too much
 martinpapa69: after 2 days of research.. my quantized dense layer is working... :D totally worth it
 FalINTOblivion0112: my ranking is going down...
 FalINTOblivion0112: :disappointed_relieved:
 AntiSquid: should i make a tutorial on how to make clash bots in a really easy way&#160;?
 jrke: which library?
 AntiSquid: you're overthinking it already
 jrke: selenium?
 jacek: magnesium!
 eulerscheZahl: use a human bot? outsource the clashing work to someone from fiverr
 Westicles: another mod dancing around the precipice
 AntiSquid: what like World of Warcraft gold farmers from china? that's basically close to slavery 
 AntiSquid: either way it's a bot programming site, if people can't figure it on their own, i guess they lack creativity :P Westicles
 eulerscheZahl: may I push him and yell THIS IS SPARTA?
 AntiSquid: what's better on CV&#160;: done clash of code or done a bot for clash&#160;!! 
 xxd: bunch of kids in a basement googling solutions for you
 xxd: a Bot Programming challenge where the game is just clash of code
 KiwiTae: Daporan a pas submit sur sogeti? 
 KiwiTae: oups:(
 KiwiTae: french sorry 
 FalINTOblivion0112: if i can create an undefeatable clash of code bot...
 eulerscheZahl: and then let it play against itself...
 KiwiTae: a better metric would be how long can the bot survive before getting spotted
 FalINTOblivion0112: right
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 jrke: i think clash of code bot won't work in shortest mode
 jrke: efficiently*
 xxd: why 
 jrke: atleast not the one i have made
 SlayerOfTheBad: Is it the case some puzzles do not display console output? I'm expecting either some debug prints or at least a compilation error but I'm not getting anything but the test case is failing regardless.
 Wontonimo: you probably did something wrong then
 SlayerOfTheBad: Yeah I got that far, but without console output I can't really see what I did wrong.
 Wontonimo: is it the test or validation?
 SlayerOfTheBad: Testcase
 Wontonimo: put a print right at the top and see if that does anything
 SlayerOfTheBad: I did, and it does not print anything, so I'm assuming it's a compilation issue.
 Wontonimo: if it doesn't compile, you should see a red error message.  
 SlayerOfTheBad: But it's not giving anything.
 Wontonimo: what language?
 SlayerOfTheBad: Rust
 Wontonimo: sorry, I know a few languages but not rust.  is there an end-of-line token in rust?  like newline?
 SlayerOfTheBad: After locally compiling it I figured out it does indeed have compilation errors, but in previous puzzles these showed up in the console.
 SlayerOfTheBad: '\n' generally.
 eulerscheZahl: i should not try to compute -int.MinValue&#160;:/
 jacek: huh
 SlayerOfTheBad: compute uint.MinValue instead. It's easier.
 SlayerOfTheBad: :P
 FalINTOblivion0112: fyi its my birthday today
 FalINTOblivion0112: remember
 LeviathanProgramming: happy budday
 FalINTOblivion0112: august 4th is my birthday
 FalINTOblivion0112: thank you everybody here at codingame
 LeviathanProgramming: obviously
 FalINTOblivion0112: you guys are awesome :grinning:
 jacek: we are? :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: I am. Are you?
 KiwiTae: FalINTOblivion0112 time to get tipsy
 Wontonimo: i'm in
 Wontonimo: :beer:
 Amir.IV: :birthday: :beer:
 dbdr: RoboStac, what kind of hiding is this?&#160;;)
 RoboStac: the worst kind where it's just a completletly unfinished bot
 RoboStac: but still slightly better than my old one
 dbdr: sorry to hear
 dbdr: what kind of search?
 RoboStac: ga
 dbdr: lack of time?
 RoboStac: that and a failure to notice how long the contest was
 dbdr: ouch
 dbdr: enjoying rust at least?&#160;:)
 RoboStac: yeah, I use it quite a bit outside of cg
 dbdr: nice! for work?
 AllYourTrees: :cheer:
 RoboStac: nah, just for other stuff (parts of  my nn backend is in rust) + been using it for codeforces / codejam etc.
 AllYourTrees: since you have stuff in C++ also, whats your take on efficiency of rust vs c++ on CG? i've been wondering about that lately
 RoboStac: I think it's pretty close but probably still a small advantage for c++
 YurkovAS: i'm hear that not possible make big static array of structs without constructor in rust (10mln+)
 AllYourTrees: yeah last time i tried to do anything with statics in rust it didn't end well
 AllYourTrees: i think there's a crate to improve the use of statics, but i don't think CG has it
 RoboStac: I tried to get my nn code working in the past but the lack of const generics meant it couldn't optimise as well so was about 10% behind my c++ one. Might be better with the newer versions but i've not tried
 mihei: o7 comrades, can someone explain a bit, what I need to do to get "examiner" achievements?
 Illedan: Hi
 Illedan: I had hopes jolindien :P
 Illedan: but gg it seems
 jolindien: thanks
 jolindien: I tried other things
 jolindien: but comed back to previous
 Illedan: I have tried so many things -.-
 jolindien: good game! it is tied
 Illedan: Yeah, very. Gg
 jolindien: me too!
 Illedan: What algo?
 jolindien: I hope it's the last time I tried so many evaluation functions
 Illedan: Did you have offline fitting of the evals?
 jolindien: AG evaluated on two opponent solutions
 jolindien: no
 Illedan: AG?
 Astrobytes: GA
 jolindien: yeah GA
 Illedan: k
 jolindien: AG is french
 Illedan: I have SGA
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Algorithme Genetique
 jolindien: SGA&#160;?

 jolindien: speak french Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: un peu
 jolindien: interesting Illedan
 Astrobytes: Oh same approach this time Ille?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: but I had to tweak a lot because of having ball vs not having ball
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that kinda changes a lot
 Illedan: and only 36 angles&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Doesn't smitsi/UCT forest work on this?
 Astrobytes: Thinking of BR
 Illedan: Too high branching afaik
 jolindien: I tried, I failed
 Illedan: You need the details of the throws
 Illedan: to get perfect Bludger bounces
 Illedan: which is very strong
 Astrobytes: Hm, yeah, it's a little more involved, very true
 RoboStac: I've tried on fb in the past and even removing spells couldn't get a version that beat my ga 
 Illedan: Might work with beam search, but had no time to try
 Illedan: Because most of the games are just optim
 Illedan: I need more games vs Jolindien :D seems I counter you a lot
 Astrobytes: Well, anyways, hope everyone enjoyed it. Not likely to see much more of these contests.
 Illedan: Sadly
 Astrobytes: Yea. It is what it is I guess&#160;:/
 Illedan: Life goes on
 Astrobytes: It most certainly does.
 Illedan: Going to miss my main source of procastination
 Astrobytes: There will always be community multis to waste time with! (well, I hope)

 ViviCode: Can anyone help me solve this mystery in Ghost in the Cell?
 ZarthaxX: ViviCode one did an invalid action and the other timeouted
 Astrobytes: Your opponent played an invalid move and you timed out
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Zartho :D
 stuxen:&#160;:)
 stuxen:&#160;;)
 Illedan: ViviCode, read the tooltip on the vier line + read the game summary, which tells the reason for the final score.
 Illedan: *viewer
 RoboStac: I'm guessing neither player handles the case where 1 player doesn't have any controlled factories
 Astrobytes: Seems that way yeah
 Bon[]Crayon: frame 80 'ViviCode&#160;: timeout!'
 Illedan: Robo submitted 30 sec before? :P
 ViviCode: ah, that's true I didn't account for that, because I figured the game would be over if my opponent doesn't have any factories. But they can still have cyborgs on the move, true.
 Astrobytes: No Dapo with ~5 sec left
 Illedan: gg
 Astrobytes: I think the top 3 are pretty clear :D
 Illedan: I'm surrounded by French :O
 RoboStac: trying to fix a crash that I don't understand
 RoboStac: should have stuck to languages where you can just do silly things and it'll continue on without crashing
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: The joy of C++ :P
 Astrobytes: "can't be wrong, it runs!"
 dbdr: RoboStac what's the symptom?
 RoboStac: getting a nan score from somewhere and then using that in a way that causes an exception
 RoboStac: pretty sure it's a bad spell target as it wasn't happening before i tried to enable magic
 dbdr: don't all float operations saturate to nan?
 dbdr: there are no exceptions in rust, by the way, I guess you mean a panic?
 RoboStac: yeah
 RoboStac: I'm trying to sort a list of floats using partial_cmp (as floats aren't ordered) and I'm assuming nan is what breaks it
 dbdr: ah yes
 dbdr: you could always decide to order nan as you want. but the right thing to do would be to reproduce the bug and fix it&#160;;)
 RoboStac: yeah, fixing where the nan was coming from was my goal
 Dohmanlechx: Can someone take a look on my C code for that Thor game? Solved it with C++ but having issues appending char list with chars in C
 ViviCode: OMG, I just fixed my code with an else: 
 RoboStac: but with 30 seconds left just doing unwrap_of(f64::MIN) seemed more likely to work
 RoboStac: *unwrap_or
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: nice last minute hack!
 Illedan: :ninja:
 Illedan: I'll finally have some break now. Cya around people&#160;:)
 dbdr: good rest!
 ViviCode: cya illedan&#160;:)
 RoboStac: might be enough to break back into top 10 which I'll be happy with
 Dohmanlechx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/XBu5hg4U">https://pastebin.com/XBu5hg4U</a>
 dbdr: yeah, probably two rust in top 10&#160;:)
 ElmerZig: what game is most fun/interesting?
 ViviCode: Clash of Code&#160;:) at least if it's not fun/interesting, it is over in 15 minutes anyway
 RoboStac: Dohmanlechx - you can't use individual chars as strings in c like that as they aren't terminated
 RoboStac: also you need direction to be size 3 so it has room for the terminating null at the end
 ElmerZig: cool. thanks vivi
 Dohmanlechx: RoboStac - that makes sense. Solved it now with your hints, thanks

 therealbeef: is there any way to retrieve the code for the sogeti contest? forgot to save it :expressionless:
 therealbeef: wanna reuse some of it for a FB bot
 Westicles: hypnosis maybe?
 reCurse: There's no report for semi-private contests so it's lost unless you convince [CG]Thibaud to look it up for you
 Astrobytes: Who doesn't back their code up anyway? Shame on you therealbeef :P
 therealbeef: got caught up in the excitement
 Illedan: I think thibaud can give you the link, because there is a page. You just need the id
 therealbeef: thanks, i will ask him. although 90% was trash code that needed a rewrite anyway
 Illedan: Mine was enough for Legend&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: He's on holiday for this week therealbeef so hang on til next week before asking him
 easdasd: hello guys
 easdasd: I love pyton
 Wontonimo: that's great
 Wontonimo: python loves you too easdasd
 reCurse: With a cold embrace until it chokes you and swallows you whole
 ViviCode: lol
 Wontonimo: it's hot in my house.  i welcome the cold feel.
 Astrobytes: Technically anacondas ain't pythons though, so that would be unlikely. They're a type of boa iirc
 Astrobytes: (wrt "swallows you whole")
 Wontonimo: i thought we were talking about the cult of python programmers
 Astrobytes: Both.
 Wontonimo: ah
 ViviCode: I just googled "death by Python" and got this:
 reCurse: Um
 reCurse: Pythons can certainly do that
 reCurse: Though I'm no snakologist
 Astrobytes: Swallow you whole?
 Astrobytes: Highly unlikely. A very small child perhaps.
 reCurse: Did you just assume his/her/its age?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: The reticulated pythons will struggle with anything smaller than you're average adult
 Astrobytes: *your
 reCurse: Well python typically comes with an anaconda distribution
 reCurse: So there
 Astrobytes: There are always exceptions ofc
 Astrobytes: I know, that's why I brought up anacondas&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: facinating
 Wontonimo: *not
 ReyZis: anaconda distribution
 Astrobytes: Yes. Something you use to fill your house with very large snakes.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I feel like death with a pulse. See ya's later
 Wontonimo: l8R
 Wontonimo: rrr
 Wontonimo: when do scores get recalculated?
 Wontonimo: 1am in France?
 Wontonimo: 11pm?
 Wontonimo: anyone know?
 Wontonimo: Hey ReyZis, are you doing Clash of Code?
 Westicles: usually done by 2:15 am paris I think
 Wontonimo: thanks Westicles&#160;!  I appreciate that
 Wontonimo: oh, it's already 1:47 in paris
 Westicles: Hmmm, interesting.  If your contrib gets approved twice you only get the 50 XP once
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Westicles: As it should be...
 Husoski: I didn't get extra for solving Mars Lander in Pascal, either... boo hoo
 Wontonimo: were you expecting extra for pascal?
 Husoski: Maybe for bash, I guess.
 Wontonimo: i'd give you extra for pascal.  i haven't seen pascal used in production since 1995
 Husoski: I have a friend who was doing a bunch of consulting in Delphi until quite recently.
 Husoski: I haven't used it professionally since '92, though.
 Wontonimo: hey, has anyone told you the -3v trick for Coders Strikes Back?
 Husoski: I don't think so...but I'm stupid in CSB, so I decided to set aside bots until I learn a bit more about AI. 
 Husoski: So, what's -3v?
 Wontonimo: oh!
 Wontonimo: let me make a short replay for you
 Wontonimo: just a sec
 Wontonimo: Here is a mars lander where it speeds to it's target, and the target is the landing pad
 Wontonimo: in this example, instead of aiming at the landing pad, it aims at the landing pad MINUS 25 times its velocity  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/574102797">https://www.codingame.com/replay/574102797</a>
 Wontonimo: The first video was supposed to be this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/574102787">https://www.codingame.com/replay/574102787</a>
 Wontonimo: oh.. it was right
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: so, in CSB, you can use this to correct your steering.  Instead of aiming for the checkpoint, aim for it minus 3 x your velocity (not thrust)
 Wontonimo: The concept comes from PID controllers, and here is the best and easiest to read paper on it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 Husoski: Nice!  I wonder where the -3 comes from? 
 Husoski: Oh...the paper.  Yes, I'll bookmark that!
 Husoski: Oh rats, I gotta fiddle with it.  My old Adobe Acrobat doesn't understand the format.  Thanks, though, and I'll get it untangled soon.
 dsfjkfdls: I forgor :skull: how to code
 dsfjkfdls: I rember :grinning:
 jraewilson: omg same:thumbsup_tone2:
 Wontonimo: hey Husoski , the -3v means to target checkpoint - 3 * velocity
 Wontonimo: the 3 comes from experimentation
 Wontonimo: try -1* , -2* and so on
 Wontonimo: it's different for every scenario.  For mars lander, the factor that works best for me is -25v
 xxd: How do I go back to a closed CoC chat
 Wontonimo: remember the chat room
 xxd: 0/10
 Wontonimo: and then put a "#" in front of it and type it here like
 Wontonimo: #coc3532
 xxd: yeah but like 
 xxd: i have the clash report
 xxd: and i want to access its corresponding chatroom
 xxd: like im on the results page
 Wontonimo: like you have to remember the name of the chat room
 xxd: thats so dumb
 Wontonimo: like dude, yeah
 Husoski: @Wontonimo I guesssed that when the coefficient for Mars 2 was -25.  Thanks a ton for the tip and the pdf. (SumatraPDF reads it just fine.)
 Husoski: (stuck scroll buffer)
 Wontonimo: hey, no prob
 Wontonimo: another cool trick that you'll probably find really straight forward is a simple drift detection like so:
 Wontonimo: calculate if at the current velocity your pod would be within 400 units of the current checkpoint within the next 5 rounds, and if so,
 Wontonimo: don't target the current checkpoint, target the one after that
 Wontonimo: and you'll drift through the checkpoint and look like a pro
 Wontonimo: the -3v and the drift will get you to mid gold
 Wontonimo: you'll get a list of checkpoints when in bronze or silver
 Husoski: I tried drifting like that and made it to a second Wood league.  That's about when I ran out of original ideas. 
 Husoski: (I just made a list of the checkpoints as they came up and noticed when they repeated.)
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: total overkill for wood.  crank speed up to 100, implement -3v, and you'll rocket up to silver
 Wontonimo: that's it, nothing more or less
 Husoski: I think I'll try the ideas on Mars 2 first, but yeah...I see the possibilities
 Wontonimo: so, i lied just a little about mars 2.
 Husoski: Tsk.
 Wontonimo: which is to say, I have 2 levels of sideways thrust
 Wontonimo: angle 15 w/ power 4 if within 200 of the adjusted x target 
 Wontonimo: angle 25ish w/ power 4 if outside 800 of the adjusted x target
 Wontonimo: so, on top of the -25v, there is a different thrust.
 Wontonimo: that's part of PID though, to have a thrust that is related to the distance
 Wontonimo: the -v part is to adjust the distance target
 Wontonimo: i don't have anything in either mars lander or CSB that integrates error.  that part of PID I've just skipped
 Wontonimo: nood gight every1
 Husoski: I'll be starting simple and adding stuff as I understand it.  I tend to take a lot of this offline so I can crash at a faster pace.&#160;:)  No graphics, but that's not too awful for someone who started in the teletype and punched card era.
 Husoski: Ditto!
 Wontonimo: oh!  very nice!  punch card all the way!  I started in the vic20 era
 Husoski: I have a VIC20 story for later, then... type at you later!
 ProCoder03: Hi for drift detection , see if our current velox and veloy will reach the checkpointX and CheckpointY and make thrust to 0 and aim for next checkpoint .Am i right. because I tried implementing at Gold and it doesn't seem to work for me&#160;??
 Michael_48: cool on the output log for only representing printing null if prints follow it. totally doesn't lead to 10 minutes of trying to find an invisible bug...

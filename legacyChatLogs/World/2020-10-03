 MadKnight: is it a new version of Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: or is it a bad idea?
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: you are late today jacek
 eulerscheZahl: and why can't i tab-complete you?
 jacek: i had to reboot
 eulerscheZahl: you must be on Windows then
 jacek: i dont do drugs
 Marchete: wsl
 AntiSquid: wsl2&#160;!
 Marchete: and GUI soon
 AntiSquid: really?
 Marchete: yeah
 AntiSquid: they are desperate to circumvent linux eh?
 Marchete: no, they went the best way, unify everything on a single platform
 Marchete: obviously for end users
 Marchete: linux standalone will be for servers and such
 Marchete: but once you have seamless windows + linux apps in a desktop
 Marchete: why will one go the painful way?
 AntiSquid: lots of reasons to stick to linux
 AntiSquid: i'd rather have windows containerized 
 AntiSquid: it's not as secure, it's bloated and frankly i personally prefer linux since it's easier to set up what i need (i don't game much)
 AntiSquid: relevant&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater">https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater</a>
 Saaalikh: hey
 Marchete: If you don't game or use Microsoft office, yeah you can go Linux or Android or even a toaster with web browser
 AntiSquid: proton, vulcan, playonlinux worked for me ... apart from that blizz ban for using some software to run their games, but screw them
 AntiSquid: i use libreoffice even on windows btw 
 DomiKo: even with playonlinux on windows you can get some extra fps, so still, it's better option
 Marchete: I'm not going to argue, everyone is free to use what they like.
 AntiSquid: not arguing, stating what i do
 DomiKo: for me, the biggest disadvantage of windows is, that you need you use a mouse, a lot ...
 Marchete: I know and it's OK
 jrke: i have just used windows yet never experienced any other 
 AntiSquid: well WSL2 is for windows jrke
 AntiSquid: check it out <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL7Jd9rjgrM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL7Jd9rjgrM</a>
 jrke: but i think for windows 10 +
 AntiSquid: what windows are you using? 7&#160;?
 jrke: im having windows 7 outdated
 eulerscheZahl: at least not XP :D
 eulerscheZahl: but seriously: you should upgrade
 jrke: it costs money for that and im not having enough
 jrke: my laptop works ok
 AntiSquid: you can upgrade free afaik, since you have the windows key from 7

 Marchete: yeah the windows 10 upgrade were pretty much for everyone
 Marchete: except on very old PC's, performance was the same
 jrke: i faced one comic thing with me last laptop
 Marchete: also you can get an OEM key pretty cheap
 Marchete: but for an old laptop is not worth it
 eulerscheZahl: linux is for free :P
 Marchete: I converted an old vista (sigh) laptop, and was terrible
 jrke: oh btw im having virtual box on my laptop so linux is there on my windows only
 Marchete: virtual box? then better have w10 with linux subsystem
 Marchete: much much better
 AntiSquid: vista is the epitome of failure
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IfnjBHtjHc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IfnjBHtjHc</a>

 Marchete: but I just saw some replay of 1st player
 Marchete: and most of the time is playing like a little boy, running all the field with the ball, straight to the goal
 jacek: looks like paper soccer eh
 Marchete: they should add some kind of stamina

 DuncanDrust: Is it possible to disable turn numbers on games with them listed over the console? In ghost in the cell, I am finding this turn count covers my output, and is annoying.
 eulerscheZahl: DuncanDrust you just asked the same on the forum
 DuncanDrust: True
 eulerscheZahl: and I answered you there
 DuncanDrust: Oh goodness
 DuncanDrust: Sorry, I did not expect any forum response that fast, and was not checking it
 DuncanDrust: My bad
 DuncanDrust: Thank you very much!
 eulerscheZahl: let me know if you have problems following my instructions, but should be pretty straight forward&#160;;)

 Talch: why I get target "MOLECULES" if the only thing I'm printing is GOTO DIAGNOSIS?
 Talch: ah I'm reading the other robot's target, got it
 wlesavo: in 2048 when you ignore whole input you do not print invalid action eulerscheZahl, resulting in 600 turn games if there are no legit actions were printed =) not that it would matter much but in the same time its a simple fix
 AntiSquid: does anyone know a user named kevi? says he got banned? i don't see him in chat history
 AntiSquid: he spammed discord just now, PMed him, he flooded me .

 AntiSquid: so much spam and no ban O_O
 AntiSquid: no kick either
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo i make a quick exit if you print the same 10 times in a row
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise i don't end the game on invalid actions based on the feedback i've received
 eulerscheZahl: antisquid how do you know that there as no kick?
 SPDene: did you miss the "[CG]Thibaud kicked these two" in the middle of that antisquid?
 AntiSquid: he didn't whine about a kick and he clearly whines about everything
 AntiSquid: referring to 2 different users SPDene
 AntiSquid: csanad and machi-something
 SPDene: i see now (hadn't scrolled down far enough)
 AntiSquid: ctrl+F
 Astrobytes: is that guy a reincarnation of the earlier guy? Sure was acting like it
 jrke: yeah code_kevi spammed a lot

 vladov200: Thanks for the link euler
 vladov200: It'll give me a better idea what to expect
 wlesavo: oh i see eulerscheZahl, i just meant that this exit dont work when you dont print valid characters i.e. input is ignored as a whole, even if it is the same. not important anyway
 eulerscheZahl: hm, truei skip invalid characters entirely. so do i for strings of length 0
 eulerscheZahl: indeed not a biggy but an easy fix
 eulerscheZahl: firing up intelliJ
 eulerscheZahl: updated
 eulerscheZahl: now an invalid character or none at all makes you lose
 eulerscheZahl: randomly spamming UDRL will still get you somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: early exit if you print the same 10 times in a row
 eulerscheZahl: that is 10 times while invalid

 Sjogs: is python or c# the most recommended language to learn in 2020 and 2021 :P learned 2021 in the past in school etc but hearing some colleagues say python is better&#160;?
 Simonka: depends what for... theres no single best language
 develoore: if there would be a best language the others wouldn't exist
 Sjogs: true. I mainly love web dev and everything that it involves :P but mainly rethinking what server sidel anguage I should keep learning. I have the most experience with c# as in with .net core etc but sometimes you have to evolve if the market asks other htings&#160;:)
 Sjogs: things *
 develoore: don't worry about the marked, worry about what interests you, if you're good you can be good in anything
 develoore: if you're bad you can be bad in the most trending languages :D
 Sjogs: hahaha that's why I'm here to not be bad ;p
 develoore: I was an android dev for four years, but quit because it bored me
 Sjogs: if any other good sites are known for learning new trends and refreshing basics be my guest&#160;:)
 Sjogs: ooof how come&#160;?
 develoore: and I felt I was more playing lego than doing a job xD
 Sjogs: hahaha true :P I have been learning some flutter recently to see what it holds up to as it has a bit of a hype around it. is fun but you are right that it's very much using given pieces or placning them differently to make your own :P
 develoore: never heard of it before, you learn something new every day :D
 Sjogs: it's ridiculous :P it's hard to keep up. swift is a big new thing apparently. average US salaray ( if you manage to get a job there :P ) is 117k  :O
 Dartisan: Flutter could get nice 2021 when the Web part will become stable.
 Sjogs: that's the annoying part sometimes :P IT changes faster then you can follow :P
 Dartisan: it's part of the game&#160;;-)
 Sjogs: I like it a lot for app development @Dartisan as it allows you to make a app for both IOS and android as a 1 man team :P if you wanna make something for yourself or have an idea. You can, without having to first learn 10 languages :P
 Sjogs: true true dartisan true
 Dartisan: Well, I wait that Dart will play also a stronger part in the Backend, or Kotlin a stronger part in the Frontend&#160;;-) 
 Sjogs: would be nice if devs can choose&#160;;) for people that like python or c# or dart . that they can choose :P
 Dartisan: But currently I use Codingame for enjoying the game in using only Dart for the solutions.
 develoore: historically these kind of things ended up having to be later rewritten to native by someone to be fast enough for production
 Sjogs: but firebase is somethign that seems cool af. but not done anything with it so only seen it in vids :P
 develoore: at least that was the case when I was on the market :D
 Sjogs: flutter translates to native when you deploy it. ( at least they say it is) but yeah I still believe for companies that can afford it that native is good. but if you are alone and wanna do it for fun or because you have an idea and wanna test it first flutter seems nice&#160;:) if it pops you can then remake it and hire some peeps :P
 Dartisan: By experience, it's hardly the Language what slows, but or using for each little feature a big library, or simply code not well structured and useless costly operations. 
 Sjogs: ^
 Dartisan: But for sure not each language is useful for each implementation case. A strong Thread operated and sync reliable application I would never think in writing in say Dart, JS or similar. Languages like Java have robust Frameworks which behind, which could do daily operations easy and robust. 
 Dartisan: And BuzzWords like MachineLearning are more in direction like Python, but you could also find implementations in other languages. 
 Sjogs: yeah they do recommend python over java though cause faster dev times. but it is a bit slower in operation speed due to run time
 Dartisan: So finally, l start learning more patterns and implementation methods and the language will be only an instrument.
 Sjogs: got any site or recommendations&#160;? :p been in a job where I mostly work Sharepoint and Intune etc etc thus not been developing much the last couple years. and I feel like I have become programming dull.aka I have lost touch in how to write code :P
 Dartisan: Yeah, that problem I have to, why i like the challenges here in codingame, the last month feel a bit like being woken up again.
 develoore: well, aside from codingame I like CTF sites which have little to do with programming
 Sjogs: feels sad when difficulty is easy and you are like EUHM WHUT ;P this site's difficulty isn't always as easy as you think or I am sleeping xDwell it's only day 2 since coming on this site again
 Sjogs: ctf&#160;?
 develoore: I still haven't discovered most of the site
 develoore: capture the flag: security training

 develoore: been here the past 10 years every now and then
 Sjogs: that does sound fun
 Dartisan: Don't fear when it seams not easy, it will become with time, it is simply unusually as the problems are different than in work. You see it, when you progress, and still the next problem is not bored.
 develoore: also don't be afraid to give up and try with easier ones, the reason I skipped a few years was that I couldn't complete a challenge, I came back when I realized it was simply over my head at the time
 Sjogs: so you skipped that exercise a few years and did others in the meantime&#160;? :P good starting point here&#160;? just selecting some randomly and solving them atm
 develoore: the moment I realized I'm not stupid was when I showed it to a friend of mine who has masters in algorithms and he also scratched his head for a while :D
 develoore: sadly not
 develoore: I didn't skip it and got anxious... learn from my mistake :D
 Dartisan: And also, when you solved an exercise, look on the other solutions of the developer. Sometimes there is an other approach, and it gives an hint for another problem you are on. 
 Sjogs: :smiley:
 develoore: clash is especially helpful in this... you may think that the problem was hard and then you check the solutions of others
 develoore: and realize you just missed a small idea
 Dartisan: Oh yes, read a page of description, scratched my head, wrote a complex code, and when I saw finally the solution, it was a simple loop with an simple operation&#160;:-)
 Sjogs: hhhha true
 Sjogs: the descriptions can sometimes put you off &gt; :P
 develoore: I had a clash with counting the numbers
 develoore: and I thought it's some difficult algorithm for 2-3 mins
 develoore: it was the reverse type
 develoore: I felt so stupid when I realized it, but I needed this realization to get to know reverse engineering better :D
 Dartisan: Yes, the classic, had it also, but it is the clocking of time you have at that moment in the head too&#160;:-)
 develoore: especially I was doing this 3 minute challenge
 Sjogs: jikes :P
 develoore: and I made it more difficult by coding every solution in C :D
 Sjogs: timers can freak you out :P
 Dartisan: As said. I use only Dart, and I need a second win, for the tree of challenges&#160;:-)
 Dartisan: But, currently I amuse me more on Bot programming, and getting some experiences in these reflexion of problem solving.
 develoore: yeah, weirdly I haven't tried that since I'm on the site
 develoore: I'm only checking it out now :D
 Sjogs: someone yday also did only that. seems it's a lot of fun to do bot programming
 Dartisan: yes, but some of the easy Puzzles like the lost child you can apply as next level there. 
 Dartisan: I like the concept of Leagues, the code growth from league to league and I like playing with the different states.
 Dartisan: So, wish you good night and have fun, I have committed my last changes for the day&#160;:-)
 develoore: I was really surpised that you can jump multiple leagues up if your bot is good enough
 develoore: it automatically attempts the next one as well

 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: But how would I indicate what to change it to?
 Scarfield: just google it&#160;:) but .replace works for replacing a substring with another substring, wouldnt work for your example though
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Nvm I came up with a better way, I was too lazy to do re.split, but list() is a thing

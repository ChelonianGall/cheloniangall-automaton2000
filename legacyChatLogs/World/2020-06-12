 JErin: hello
 JErin: is anybody here?
 DarkScene: hi is anybody alive
 DarkScene: i have trouble with IDE , wrote solution correctly but show this message  "Timeout: your program did not write to the standard output in due time."
 WINWINWIN: Solution may be correct, but if you take more than 50ms, it will timeout
 WINWINWIN: Test it offline adding a print statement for end time and see what happends
 DarkScene: how to do that offline&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Are you doing a puzzle or a bot program?
 WINWINWIN: if its a puzzle, just copy paste the puzzle test case
 DarkScene: puzzles
 DarkScene: where is possible to test offline&#160;? Recommend please. 
 WINWINWIN: which language?
 DarkScene: python3
 WINWINWIN: For a temporary run,
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/">https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/</a>
 WINWINWIN: paste your code, then click on run
 WINWINWIN: after that paste the test case line by line
 WINWINWIN: And, add this to the beginning of the code:
 WINWINWIN: import time
 WINWINWIN: start = time.time()
 WINWINWIN: And, at the end:
 WINWINWIN: print((time.time() - start) // 1000)
 DarkScene: output that line line &gt; for i in range(8):
 DarkScene: as error
 DarkScene: but that line was ok at start on codingame at all 
 WINWINWIN: you cannot copy paste all at once...
 WINWINWIN: copy paste line by line
 DarkScene: why is so&#160;?

 DarkScene: how it can be pinging leads to zero packet received to this website&#160;? I have no wonder for error like this Timeout: your program did not write to the standard output in due time.
 DarkScene: i did that pinging on cmd
 Astrobytes: pinging the website is not related to your code timing out
 Astrobytes: You have either exceeded the time limit or you have printed your answer incorrectly.
 DarkScene: related , because after refresh brings other errors
 DarkScene: on same code
 Astrobytes: Timeout: *your program* did not write to the standard output in due time
 MuratToprak: I really leader on Wood1??
 DarkScene: i have that problem and no solution even if code is corected on youtube was video with answer and i put it and post error  : Timeout: your program did not write to the standard output in due time.
 struct: where?
 DarkScene: the descent puzzle makes such errors
 struct: language?
 DarkScene: english
 struct: programming languagfef
 struct: language*
 DarkScene: python3

 DarkScene: i hope you can view it.
 struct: you misspell height
 struct: you put height = heigh
 struct: also it should only be height = mountain_h
 Astrobytes: And fix your indentation
 DarkScene: i fixed but still dont work for me
 Astrobytes: Paste your code again
 DarkScene: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f11e45d-3313-41c5-bff4-96092f372e1f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f11e45d-3313-41c5-bff4-96092f372e1f</a>
 Astrobytes: It's your indentation, as I said
 DarkScene: yes
 Hjax: ouch that indentation 
 Astrobytes: after you use while, for, or if, the next line must be indented with a tab
 Astrobytes: Your code is not indented correctly
 struct: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a7f9b59-e1f5-4126-ab3d-84bfcd9badcf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a7f9b59-e1f5-4126-ab3d-84bfcd9badcf</a>
 Astrobytes: Well, I was trying to avoid doing it for him but... :P
 Hjax: thanks struct, my eyes arent bleeding anymore
 struct: I updated ui a bit
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/843257e808c280174462ae480c45d0629921f7">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/843257e808c280174462ae480c45d0629921f7</a>
 Hjax: that is one thing i like about people learning python as a first language 
 struct: Added lines for debug toggle
 Hjax: it forces good indentation habits
 Astrobytes: Yeah, in that respect it is good I agree
 struct: Can you see both lines astro?
 struct: Im not sure blue can be seen easily for some colorblind people
 Astrobytes: Yeah can see it fine
 struct: thanks
 Astrobytes: If one line was a light purple and one was blue I'd have trouble&#160;;)
 struct: UI looks good enough right?
 Astrobytes: Yea, I like the debug lines, good work man
 Hjax: got to all caps the stuff in the settings 
 Astrobytes: ^ yeah
 Astrobytes: Nice of Random Python Guy to thank us all eh
 Hjax: game ui looks good though ^_^
 struct: I will only stop adding multies one I get puzzle of the week
 struct: once *
 Astrobytes: Never stop struct, never stop&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Think of all those sad little board games out there, just wishing someone would port them to CG
 struct: oh no default replay in Yavalath
 struct: doesnt show pictures anymore&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: SDK update thing?
 struct: One was my removed account
 DarkScene: i have fixed indentation  but still problem exist
 Astrobytes: Paste your code again
 struct: I guess automaton2000 pic link was changed
 Automaton2000: legends of code and magic
 DarkScene: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e5a0480-2041-4ce5-8eb9-7894ddf0693b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e5a0480-2041-4ce5-8eb9-7894ddf0693b</a>
 struct: ah it did, it wasnt this picture
 struct: the if is not indented
 Hjax: your indentation is still incorrect DarkScene
 struct: AutomatonNN hi
 AutomatonNN: okk why the code is still only what i don't want
 Astrobytes: The if needs to be in line with the mountain_h line
 Astrobytes: You have an extra tab
 DarkScene: i have fixed now it 
 DarkScene: and game works as should be
 Astrobytes: Just remember that for every loop or condition, everything after it must be indented by 1 tab
 Astrobytes: You'll get used to it soon 
 DarkScene: can i remove comments as code in codegaming&#160;?
 ZombieSkull_c262: It's a bit annoying that you are limited to the coding options but at least it helps thinks in the most simplistic way
 ZombieSkull_c262: yeah you can
 Uljahn: the only thing you shouldn't touch is inputs
 Hjax: do the best temperatures submissions hard code the test cases?  
 struct: Important update submited 
 struct: Hjax I have no clue what they do
 struct: Some just run bash code
 Hjax: i feel like ive spent too much time on the code golf problems and i only get things im not very satisfied with 
 Hjax: what makes bash such a good code golf language? i havent really used it 
 struct: I'm not sure, I don't know bash 
 Hjax: like someone did power of thor in 58 characters, thats less than half the size of my submission 
 struct: I know that feeling
 struct: I have 93 chars solution in js and first is 56 
 struct: on power of thor you never need to go north
 Hjax: .......
 Hjax: really?
 struct: yeah
 Hjax: thats hilarious 
 struct: This warning was not a thing before was  it "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 Astrobytes: I've been getting that all day
 Astrobytes: But randomly
 Astrobytes: As in, I was definitely still reading the available input
 struct: I think they are touching chat too
 struct: it messes a bit once i open it in a new window
 struct: on same window*P
 Astrobytes: Hm, chat's been OK for me so far
 struct: it works fine, but when I open ide, it will show me only some messages, then refresh and show all again
 struct: Hjax you have done temperatures too right?
 Scarfield: i got that message yesterday struct, when i was using the wrong link 
 Hjax: yeah ive done temperatures, im like 20 characters off of the best python submission
 Hjax: temperatures would be so much easier if you didnt have to print 0 if you get no temperatures 
 struct: I have 3 chars more than best javsascript
 struct: with js
 struct: but i never found how to reduce
 Hjax: i just add the first input*9 to my list of strings to sort 
 Hjax: because 111111111 is greater than the biggest possible input 
 Hjax: but im sure theres a better way to do it 
 struct: I use sort
 DarkScene: is codingame good for beginners&#160;?
 Matrix007: ohn is a farmer, and he is very smart. He observed that the amount of corn he gets in a year is equal to the sum of the amounts that he got in the last 3 years except, of course, his first 3 years as a good farmer. So given a year N and T0, T1 and T2, where Ti is the amount he gets on year i, output the amount of corn he will get in the year N mod 1000000007. can anyone understand this
 Matrix007: sry
 Matrix007: for the long copy paste
 Uljahn: DarkScene: CG is good for practice
 Hjax: Matrix007 your problem sounds like the tribonacci sequence, but i dont understand the mod big at the end 
 Hjax: mod bit*
 Astrobytes: Something to do with integer overflow prevention 
 Hjax: oh, i read it as taking the mod of the year, not the mod of the result 
 Hjax: that makes sense 
 Matrix007: well thanks
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's how I read it first time through too
 duy_e: hi&#160;! i have a question , can I redo the problem that I didn't done bẻoe?
 duy_e: i mean before 
 Astrobytes: Puzzle or clash?
 duy_e: clash
 duy_e: clash 
 Astrobytes: duy_e No, but you can search for it here if you remember the statement/name of it and solve it in your own time<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>

 eulerscheZahl: get rekt
 struct: I should finish statement today
 struct: I don't think I need to change anything else in the game
 MSmits: maybe an anti-fox handicap?
 eulerscheZahl: but you want to farm upvotes
 struct: fox already had ai
 struct: from 1990
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: saw it
 MSmits: its cool
 MSmits: ttyl getting out of train 
 struct: cya
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that AI is older than me :o
 struct: Yeah, same
 struct: I wonder how strong it is
 eulerscheZahl: hard to tell with 10 games in demo contributions
 struct: also most of bots are random
 struct: so there is that
 struct: The downside of giving legal actions
 eulerscheZahl: but where is anisquid with D?
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot the t&#160;:/
 struct: Havent seen him in a while
 struct: also where is tri c trac ai
 Astrobytes: hey, mine isn't random
 eulerscheZahl: first move?
 struct: ^
 eulerscheZahl: or last?
 Astrobytes: sorted, and both, depending on id
 eulerscheZahl: and where is thunderbird?
 Astrobytes: good point, haven't seen him for months now
 eulerscheZahl: online on discord
 Astrobytes: Not much time for CG I guess
 struct: I need to start hiring someone to write the statements
 struct: Also I think I should start writing default ais 
 struct: Or do you think this is not needed?
 struct: All my default ais are random seed, print rand.next
 Hjax: oooh rank 40 in pr2 
 Hjax: starting to get somewhere
 Pooshlmer: A starting framework would definitely encourage participation
 darkhorse64: waiting for your PM 
 darkhorse64: I did not spend much time on my pr2 bot. The bulk of it is 30 LOC and I am 140th with it. Previous version was a straight dump of my PR1 bot. It's only know that i realize that PR2 is an interesting game
 darkhorse64: *now*
 Hjax: my bot is currently 204 lines
 Hjax: i should port my pr2 bot to pr1 lol
 rares: .
 rares: does any1 know why console says no output found despite me printing stuff?
 Uljahn: could be extra space or \n, or printing to stderr
 struct: I did not had a steal for this game
 MSmits: it's thought to be solved as a draw
 struct: add
 MSmits: even if it hasn't been proven
 MSmits: assuming you're talking about Othello
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: yeah I think it's fine not to add a steal here
 MSmits: in yavalath it was absolutely critical to have a steal because without it, p1 would always win
 struct: yeah
 struct: I added in yinsh, but I think its not needed at all
 MSmits: havent looked at Yinsh yet
 MSmits: for me the order is: Oware -&gt; Othello -&gt; Breakthrough currently
 struct: I think to get a bot working is too much work
 struct: What are you currently doing on Oware?
 struct: Solving end game?
 MSmits: yes, looking at several things for oware, including end games
 ArnaldurBjarnason: how hard would it be to have scheme added to the useable language
 ArnaldurBjarnason: list?
 MSmits: not sure what you are talking about
 ArnaldurBjarnason: scheme is a programming language and I would love to be able to make bots using it
 ArnaldurBjarnason: it's a LISP
 Uljahn: you'd better ask admins on forum or discord
 ArnaldurBjarnason: ok cool, thanks for the tip&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah, well if it's not in there its not likely to be added any time soon, they add languages rarely, but they do add them
 MSmits: last time i think they polled to see which language should be added
 MSmits: D was added then
 Uljahn: D is for dead?
 Uljahn: nobody uses it besides Antisquid
 struct: I would not say he uses it
 Uljahn: jk
 ArnaldurBjarnason: It's a pretty neat language but most detractors say that it's not a significant enough improvement over C++ to be worth the change
 MSmits: those damned detractors
 MSmits: always the same thing with those guys
 struct: My coding skils have improved since I switched to D
 struct: Now Im able to finish community multies in 1 day
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: you dont code them in D
 struct: Sorry I keep trolling&#160;:(
 MSmits: I thought maybe D made you hate coding bots so much that you exclusively focus on creating multis now
 MSmits: arggh I hate this, my best oware bot has an ugly part in the code and when I "improve" it my bot performs worse
 struct: Nah, I just  stopped because I enjoy creating multis
 inoryy: i'm so productive since I switched to D I don't even need to submit to multis anymore
 inoryy: I just look at problem statements and know the solution
 MSmits: why bother coding it then 
 MSmits: you've got nothing to prove, you D wizard you
 struct: D got you a job at Deepmind
 Hjax: the D IDE is just where you put in your paypal so they know where to send the prize money
 MSmits: ahh that's why its called D
 inoryy: math checks out, struct
 struct: Yeah, D was created by DeepMind
 jacek: woah what a push
 MalwareBoy: malwareboy says hello
 Scarfield: hi
 struct: hi Scarfield
 struct: MSmits how much time would you say I should put for Othello?
 MSmits: time?
 MSmits: oh calc time
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: 100 ms possible?
 struct: even higher
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: at least 100
 struct: even 300 should be possible
 Scarfield: max of 60 turns
 Scarfield: so 30 per player
 struct: 490 max
 struct: or my math is wrong?
 MSmits: well I dont know, if you put a higher max you'll make submits slower is all
 struct: yeah
 struct: Im not sure what to do 
 struct: I put 2 sec at first turn though 
 struct: for memory allocation of players
 MSmits: 2&#160;??
 struct: 2 sec yeah
 MSmits: why 2 instead of 1&gt;?
 struct: firs turn only
 struct: because on uTTT 1 sec is not enough for me
 struct: to allocate all nodes :p
 Scarfield: ;o
 Scarfield: :o *
 Scarfield: do you set node values that are not = 0
 MSmits: struct, is this on c++?
 struct: yes MSmits
 struct: let me check Scarfield
 MSmits: I can fill all memory and it requires almost no time
 MSmits: your problem is that you are assigning values to properties
 MSmits: dont do that
 MSmits: just int x;
 MSmits: not int x = 0;
 struct: all values are 0
 MSmits: yeah dont do that
 MSmits: dont set it to 0
 struct: Node()&#160;: childCount(0), moveBoardPos(0), moveBoardIndex(0), visits(0), score(0), firstChildIndex(0) {}
 MSmits: leave it whatever it is in memory
 struct: ah I see
 MSmits: then it will just reserve the memory
 MSmits: and it will take no noticable time
 Scarfield: oh i thought that was better practice to do that, and the compiler sets them to 0 anyway?
 Scarfield: int x; is the same as int x = 0;&#160;?
 struct: ok I did that
 struct: and my sims dropped to 30%
 struct: lol
 MSmits: Scarfield no it isnt
 MSmits: not in c++
 Astrobytes: should probably init a few of those somewhere else, your code must be expected init'd values
 MSmits: the memory is whatever it was
 MSmits: some random bit configuration
 perseverent: what happened in UTTT in the last 2 years?
 perseverent:&#160;:)
 jacek: so in theory i could read someone else code? :thinking:
 MSmits: no idea
 Astrobytes: calloc will zero the memory but I think that's slower
 jacek: UTTT is 2 years old?
 perseverent: I look at my last submit
 perseverent: 2 years old
 jacek: oh my
 struct: 05-03-2018
 perseverent: some new ideas in the meantime?
 Astrobytes: Yes. Run. Run away.
 struct: Yes

 struct: best idea
 Astrobytes: Pimping your multis again struct :P
 jacek: yea, who does that
 Astrobytes: ...
 struct: Community multis should get more love&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Speaking of which I still didn't do Paper Soccer
 jacek: as for uttt, it is still faster bitboard + mcts fest
 jacek: well and opening heuristic
 jacek: :c
 Astrobytes: The Teccles Heuristic (c) Teccles
 perseverent: no minimax ideas?
 perseverent: opening book?
 struct: opening books yeah
 Hjax: hmmm i just lost a game of pr2 where i had 102 zones to 44
 Hjax: awkward
 WINWINWIN: They went for the base?
 Hjax: nope! they just retook the map 
 Hjax: and eventually had more than me 
 Hjax: i dont know how to tell when i should check areas again 
 Hjax: to know if my opponent has taken them 
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/472475629">https://www.codingame.com/replay/472475629</a>
 struct: Explaining the legal moves is not easy
 struct: Is the only thing I'm missing
 Scarfield: piece has to be adjacent to a opponent piece on board, and have a straight line of opponent pieces between your placed piece and another of your own pieces
 Scarfield: something like that&#160;:)
 Scarfield: btw if you declare your nodes with what is basicly random member values, dont you risk to get wrong links when building up a tree?
 Scarfield: i could have sworn i read somewhere declaring like int x; would automatically set x to zero&#160;:'(
 Hankdane: It depends on the language and the compiler.
 Scarfield: c++ in this case

 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: i dont know where i got that misinformation from, maybe a nightmare :p
 Scarfield: but i still dont understand MSmits why you say not to initialize members then? 
 Astrobytes: speeds up the allocation, just make sure you initialise them with something/assign something to them elsewhere before you use them
 Astrobytes: Say like when you add a child node, pull the node from the node pool, and set it's member variables there
 Scarfield: ty FastroBytes
 Astrobytes: yw StarField
 Scarfield: Old School screensaver flashbacks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hahaha forgot about that one
 struct: I think I will make it 150ms
 struct: 150ms * 60 = 9 sec + 4 sec = 13 sec
 struct: not bad I guess
 Scarfield: how many games for a community multi when submitting?
 struct: Im not sure
 struct: I think 100
 struct: I will try on yavalath
 struct: give me a sec
 struct: If its 100 its not too bad
 struct: 13 sec * 100 = 1300 sec / N_machines
 struct: should be under 10min at worse
 struct: Unless there is CSB promotion
 Scarfield: xD
 struct: I get experience if I upvote my contribution :D
 eulerscheZahl: known fact struct. same for own comments and solutions
 eulerscheZahl: reported long ago, CG doesn't care
 struct: 1 exp for comment upvote?
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i never did that myself. i level up like a pro by finding 4 player CSB for 500XP legend
 struct: Is it still up?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but access is restricted to those who already played it now
 Astrobytes: 4 player CSB?
 Scarfield: you submitted i think astro?
 Astrobytes: I did?
 eulerscheZahl: basically multiplayer search race
 Scarfield: euler linked it here, and 5-10 players jumped on the train :D
 eulerscheZahl: no collisions and 1 pod per player
 Astrobytes: Don't remember it
 eulerscheZahl: i was just having fun with the API
 eulerscheZahl: also found code of ice and fire, kutulu, crystal rush
 eulerscheZahl: and code4life i think
 eulerscheZahl: all of these were older than the respective contest
 eulerscheZahl: so i reported it and they pretty much restricted everything now
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. a replay only gets public when you hit the share button in the bottom corner
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i think these events are related
 Astrobytes: You're a clype euler, a clype I tell ye
 Scarfield: clype?
 eulerscheZahl: now i need a dict
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: (an informer in SCots)
 Astrobytes: *Scots
 eulerscheZahl: "Petze"
 Astrobytes: Yep, same
 eulerscheZahl: i hate it when i comment on how shitty a contribution is and then it just gets deleted
 Astrobytes: Yeah, like the n*4 one
 struct: Seems to be 90 matches for community multies
 eulerscheZahl: today i found now: how many digits does a^b have, causing huge numbers
 Astrobytes: Yes 90
 Astrobytes: overflow levels of huge numbers?
 eulerscheZahl: but a python 1-lines proved the setter's solution being wrong on the smaller cases
 struct: Ok, I think statement is good enough, now I wait for upvotes
 eulerscheZahl: expected solution was something with log10
 eulerscheZahl: but screwed up the rounding
 Astrobytes: nice, very professional
 Astrobytes: I kinda like it when people defend their useless contribution until their dying breath
 eulerscheZahl: with pictures. definitely struct's handwriting right there
 Scarfield: minecraft crafting?
 struct: Now pictures use CG link 
 struct: Not like yavalath :D
 Astrobytes: (handiwork eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: highly appreciated
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i don't follow my own advice here
 Astrobytes: good move struct&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i should also upload my avatar just for the demo replay
 Scarfield: just gave you 5 more exp structo, nice work on the othello&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: now when i change it and switch back later, the old avatar gets removed at some point
 eulerscheZahl: leaving a blank space in the default match
 struct: thanks Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: 10p for contribution upvotes
 MSmits: perseverent if you're still here: Opening books are used by 4-5 players and they are mostly good against other players with a book. If you're up against someone without a book, it will not improve your winrate more than 5% max, maybe less
 eulerscheZahl: 5 for solution upvotes, 1 for comments
 struct: maybe he upvoted comments
 Scarfield: 5 comments upvoted, already upvoted the contribution
 Astrobytes: Description seems good struct
 Astrobytes: *Statement
 struct: I wrote the game without reading the rules
 struct: Nothing can go wrong
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: like a pro&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I know, I remember the chaining
 struct: Yeah, I implemented chaining ...
 struct: and wasted time on animations for it :D
 MSmits: this is like me assuming subs can teleport in ooc :P
 Astrobytes: hehe, worked out alright though
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: lol :D
 Astrobytes: That was funny
 MSmits: it sure made the tracking easier to code without the teleport
 MSmits: I pushed re curse hard in oware
 Astrobytes: struct, almost ready to publish to pending right?
 Astrobytes: I saw that MSmits, and jace k. Meanwhile, I temporarily broke mine lol
 struct: I must wait for tric trac comment
 Astrobytes: Yes, true struct
 MSmits: he's still protesting?
 eulerscheZahl: protesting against what?
 Scarfield: isnt he from UK?
 Astrobytes: Been chained to a fence for 3 days now 
 MSmits: I dunno, it is an assumption
 Scarfield: lol
 struct: My guess it's holidays
 MSmits: Astrobytes chained to a fence to protest?
 Scarfield: to a tree
 Scarfield: dont fell the tree
 Astrobytes: He's French CarShield
 eulerscheZahl: here in Germany we lock ourselves to the railway tracks
 MSmits: oh, the smart way to protest
 eulerscheZahl: to stop nuclear waste transportation
 Astrobytes: Yeah MSmits, or glued to a window or something
 Scarfield: oh bastroClype
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: yeah, let the waste sit in the middle of a train track where terrorist can grab it
 MSmits: instead of a safe bunker
 Astrobytes: GGWP FarField
 struct: Should I post othello on discord?
 struct: I need exp to get Yavalath back&#160;:(
 trictrac: Hello all, struct you provide a new multi "othelllo" in some hours&#160;: as usual good job&#160;!
 Scarfield: xD
 struct: Hi tric trac
 MSmits: you can get it back struct?
 Astrobytes: yay 
 MSmits: there's trictrac, he's on his phone in the middle of a riot now I bet
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: dodge, tric trac, they're shooting rubber bullets
 MSmits: we need you alive
 Astrobytes: He doesn't live in Marseille or Paris MSmits
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: no MSmits
 struct: its gonne forever
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well everyone knows it's yours
 Astrobytes: You can retrieve via CG staff no?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOPOQ1psvSM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOPOQ1psvSM</a>
 struct: I guess
 MSmits: nice video&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, I remember that one
 Astrobytes: (no it wasn't me)
 struct: I can calculate circle speed if I dont know speed but I know the time it takes to reach the point right?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised how quickly i found it again
 struct: Ok im dumb
 struct: its easy
 struct: Im gonna need it for the next multi
 struct: for the animations
 MSmits: the next&#160;?
 struct: Yeah, its almost done
 eulerscheZahl: have you decided which will be next?
 struct: I never finished it
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 jacek: sh...?
 eulerscheZahl: tzaar?
 Astrobytes: Othello II: Physics Edition
 struct: shobu
 struct: yeah
 struct: Tzaar I have it finished
 MSmits: there's 3D TTT
 struct: but never bothered submiting
 struct: The viewer is very bad
 Astrobytes: 4D Yinsh or I'm out
 MSmits: if you have a 3D game, then time is the 4th dimension
 MSmits: so...
 Scarfield: We Want 4 Spacial Dimensions! 
 MSmits: all CG games are 3D
 Astrobytes: Fair point. 5D Yinsh. More Yinsh games is the 5th dimension
 MSmits: because of time
 trictrac: With this number of new multi produces by struct, It wiil be very very difficult to provide good bot for all these multi
 MSmits: says the guy that put a bot on all multis in less than a year&#160;:)
 struct: You don't have to play all
 jacek: should make general game multi
 Astrobytes: I think we need a Board Game section :D
 MSmits: good idea
 Scarfield: or a structo section
 eulerscheZahl: you will soon bypass my by contribution count :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: i totally agree about the board game section
 trictrac: one upvote for the struct section
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but a board game section would be great, in all seriousness
 struct: yeah
 Scarfield: true
 struct: I agree
 MSmits: well that saves me a few seconds navigating to the next multi to play
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Where would I post that on the discord?
 eulerscheZahl: we can add tags like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/classic-board-games">https://www.codingame.com/learn/classic-board-games</a>
 struct: Community games?
 jacek: programming memes
 struct: Oh no I see othello
 Astrobytes: lel
 struct: Ah its the puzzle euler mentioned
 MSmits: it's cool, you can link it in the statement
 MSmits: if its good that is
 trictrac: with a specific leaderboard for Msmits, jacek, dbdr, recurse, robo, ....
 MSmits: and trictrac
 Astrobytes: Oh also, we need ideas and suggestions for the CG SDK Wiki
 Astrobytes: while I'm here
 MSmits: how many nr 1 trictrac?
 MSmits: breakthrough right?
 Astrobytes: lol trictrac
 eulerscheZahl: i answered 1 question in the wiki. so there is an answer in the list of open questions :D
 MSmits: ahh checkers too
 eulerscheZahl: and in that process doxxed my ISP
 trictrac: only 5 and some second behind you
 MSmits: *only*
 struct: One thing I can't understand
 struct: is why they dont update skeleton repo
 struct: It's so old
 MSmits: oh you have checkers/breakthrough and 3 smaller games?
 struct: oh they updated it
 struct: :D
 MSmits: I only have 2 atm I think
 trictrac: one some they are not many players
 MSmits: yeah, i didnt do the smaller games yet. I spend way too much time on some games
 eulerscheZahl: they should still accept the pull request regarding intelliJ files in gitignore
 struct: How did you end up leaking ISP euler?
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl, I thought that reply was yours. We need to make the wiki a coherent source of info though, not just random facts without context like re Curse pointed out on the discord. Ideas would be appreciated
 eulerscheZahl: editing the wiki page, logs show my IP
 struct: ah
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, i'm not motivated to invest much into that wiki. but i like the chat history&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Just ideas, not asking for work to be done&#160;;)
 Scarfield: but "would you kindly"
 jacek: struct there is othello puzzle, maybe you can reuse the background from there :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: the background is the smallest issue
 eulerscheZahl: but it's a good one, showing the actual game
 eulerscheZahl: for an overview page i prefer those over great artwork that has nothing to do with the actual game
 struct: I guess I'll ask nicola when I see him around
 MSmits: never seen him around
 MSmits: but maybe he's online on euler hours in the morning?
 Astrobytes: "euler hours" :D
 MSmits: you know.. when normal people sleep
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=42875225402001">https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=42875225402001</a>
 MSmits: looks good
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: nicola is online right now
 Astrobytes: While the community sleeps, euler beats them down
 eulerscheZahl: mostly active on #fr
 MSmits: ahh like so many
 struct: Ok I need a translator
 eulerscheZahl: he speaks English
 MSmits: even if his English was bad I'm sure you can make him understand you want to use his pic&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i hereby volunteer for english to english translation and back
 eulerscheZahl: he wrote a lot of puzzles. i'm pretty sure his English is decent
 MSmits: is that when you correct people's grammar?
 Astrobytes: I can do Scots&lt;&gt;English
 eulerscheZahl: no, i would just echo
 MSmits: ah
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: and parrot for the way back
 MSmits: but without the errors?
 eulerscheZahl: with errors to keep the translation idiomatic 
 Scarfield: using google translate into a language and back to the starting language make for some great song lyrics :p
 MSmits: would be fun to have a parrot that repeats you and corrects your errors
 Astrobytes: Ever use Translation Party?
 MSmits: but I guess they live so long because they don't do that
 eulerscheZahl: a long time ago i used babelfish
 eulerscheZahl: i feel old
 eulerscheZahl: was impressed how good it worked
 struct: Remember if you have any suggestion for games you would like to see, feel free to say so, tric trac asked for one, but I can't find a way to port it to CG
 MSmits: Scarfield I think jimmy fallon has some game where they sing such lyrics
 Scarfield: never heard of it astro, yea smits thats where i saw it&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested yinsh. we have it now but it almost broke you&#160;:(
 struct: This is what he suggested
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi</a>
 MSmits: I think this happens when we let struct do his own ideas
 MSmits: when i said he had to do othello, it was no problem
 eulerscheZahl: yinsh was my idea
 struct: yeah it was euler
 struct: that suggested
 MSmits: oh, it's just you then
 struct: long ago
 eulerscheZahl: but then didn't feel like coding it
 Astrobytes: Scarfield <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.translationparty.com/">https://www.translationparty.com/</a>
 Scarfield: yea just found it, doesnt seem to do anything though?
 jacek: try deepl translator
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl so next time wield the structo responsibly
 jacek: destructo
 Astrobytes: Aw crap, it's down&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: It translates to Japanese back to English repeatedly until equilibrium
 MSmits: struct is like mjolnir only every time you use it, it makes boardgames
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: It's usually rather amusing
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry MSmits, coding my brainfarts myself atm
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 Scarfield: but who is worthy to hold structo then?
 MSmits: good question
 eulerscheZahl: let's release othello and wait 2 or 3 weeks
 eulerscheZahl: then #1 can request a new game
 MSmits: cool
 struct: That would be a nice idea actually
 MSmits: I will ask Renard if he has any other bots from the 90s
 Scarfield: xD
 struct: lol
 struct: Do you want me to publish it?
 MSmits: If the testers say it's good, then it's good
 eulerscheZahl: you cant decide that alone
 eulerscheZahl: need 3 approvals
 struct: 3 damn
 MSmits: should be easy
 struct: 3 is so low tbh
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: gotta do some shopping, before store closes, ttyl. 
 struct: What tags I add for Othello?
 eulerscheZahl: cries in space maze
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: The secret is to give legal actions
 Astrobytes: Tags: Classic board game, board game, trytobeatlerenardsoldAI
 struct: Bitboarding
 Astrobytes: MCTS, minimax, the usual
 Scarfield: Tags: Don't invite euler to coc
 Astrobytes: Oh and Simulated Healing or whatever it was from the SR WIP :P
 Astrobytes: *ANhealing it was :D
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: MiniSnax, AlphaEata (greddy algos :P )
 Astrobytes: *greedy
 Scarfield: GAimax
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah. True AI too.
 Scarfield: of course
 Astrobytes: Prune array
 Scarfield: poor seg xD
 Scarfield: ceg *
 Astrobytes: HE loves it :P
 jacek: and yet not long ago some people thought about othello's chainings..
 Scarfield: i missed this othello chaining thing?
 Astrobytes: Yeah we got him earlier for that :D
 struct: Scarfield I thought othello had chains
 Astrobytes: He was under the impression that moves trigger chains of flips, rather than flipping all pieces at once. It was... interesting
 struct: So I added them in my code
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: And animated them very well
 Astrobytes: Yeah struct, do you plan variable board sizes?
 struct: no
 Scarfield: so if a flipped piece would allow new peices to flip sort of chain?
 struct: yes Scarfield
 struct: let me see if I have replay
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/F1XrTQX.gifv">https://i.imgur.com/F1XrTQX.gifv</a>
 Astrobytes: then darkhorse's comment is valid, you only need to read board dimension once, outside loop
 struct: Something like that
 struct: I know Astrobytes, but most of the games the var is inside
 struct: its to not confuse players
 darkhorse64: More to the point than my previous comment. 
 Astrobytes: lol :D
 darkhorse64: It got me 2 XP. 
 Astrobytes: Yeah maybe so struct but 1. it's annoying, 2. one more thing to read = wasted time
 Scarfield: hmm could maybe be an interesting game though :D Structhello
 Astrobytes: 2XP :D
 darkhorse64: Only 9998 left for level 40
 struct: it makes it easier to start the timer
 struct: :p
 struct: Ok Ill move the height to outside the loop
 struct: or shouldnt I even add height?
 Astrobytes: Cool. Also - how would it confuse players?
 struct: All my games had that I think
 struct: thats why I thought it was generic
 eulerscheZahl: official games like the great escape give the board size in input too
 Astrobytes: Something like boardSize // width and height of board
 darkhorse64: In the loop&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It's really annoying.
 eulerscheZahl: outside the loop
 struct: ok Ill keep
 struct: but outside the loop
 Astrobytes: Yeah don't get rid of it, just outside the loop
 darkhorse64: Fine. Upvote me. 12997 left
 Astrobytes: lol, I even did it for you 
 Astrobytes: *actually not even
 darkhorse64: Should I really solve 15 puzzles in Haskell, VB.Net or Clojure&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, be smart
 eulerscheZahl: codegolf counts as 2 if you submit twice
 struct: We commented at same time astro
 eulerscheZahl: A*Craft, CG sponsored: submit default code, get terrible score with 100% corret
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: same for number shifting
 Astrobytes: Nice struct, now upvote my comment
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: CGFunge Prime: solve once, farm language achievements
 struct: Time to get 1sst
 darkhorse64: I have ample solutions provision. What bothers is writing code for esoteric  (to be kind) languages
 darkhorse64: *bothers me*
 struct: LeRenard I'm sorry, I broke your bot, I moved the height outside the game loop
 Astrobytes: Don't think that'll take a lot of time to fix tbph&#160;;)
 struct: ok I updated it, also updated repo
 struct: I wont touch it anymore
 darkhorse64: First with a 2 points margin&#160;!!!
 Astrobytes: Seems to be working OK
 darkhorse64: Come rekt me
 Astrobytes: I did
 darkhorse64: gg
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: struct - boarSize?
 darkhorse64: beardSize&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Wild or...?
 Astrobytes: tailleDuSanglier
 Astrobytes:  = 8
 jacek: :B
 struct: omfg
 struct: zzzz
 Astrobytes: Othello: Wild Pig Edition
 struct: I was ready to delete othello from my pc
 struct: you spoke in time
 Astrobytes: I'm just glad I stopped laughing in time to comment
 struct: In statement I also wrote
 struct: boarSize
 struct: wtf
 Astrobytes: btw, don't remove until successful publishing
 Gilbino: hi guys
 struct: I can just download it
 struct: hi
 Gilbino: where are you from
 struct: Check the flag
 Astrobytes: Hover over our avatars
 Gilbino: sorry i'm new here around
 struct: no problem
 Astrobytes: all good
 struct: I was also thinking in porting this game
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/117/ta-yu">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/117/ta-yu</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh wow, now that does look interesting
 Gilbino: in fact i know this site from years... then i met the nintendo challenge
 Gilbino: anybody did it?
 JBM: atleast 93
 Astrobytes: 2 player Pipe Dream with extras
 Astrobytes: @struct
 struct: You like it?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 struct: On this on I guess I could increase board
 Astrobytes: Probably. Not by tooo much though 
 Astrobytes: struct, now you have boarSize declared and read, then try to read from boardSize in the first for loop
 struct: What do you mean?
 struct: Did i broke it?
 struct: omfg
 struct: I renamed in statement
 JBM: boarSize
 struct: and not in stub?
 JBM: that's a call for a new game
 Astrobytes: struct <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/LagmqOF">https://imgur.com/a/LagmqOF</a>
 Astrobytes: Boar Wars
 struct: ahahahah
 struct: I see
 struct: I only renamed one
 struct: submiting...
 Astrobytes: Version II: "Tuez le sanglier"
 JBM: how queer
 JBM: i'm so not expecting not-english here
 Astrobytes: A random walking wild pig strides around the board, knocking your stones off
 struct: fixed?
 struct: JBM is nicola still active?
 Astrobytes: JBM, only cause I renamed his variable as tailleDuSanglier earlier
 Astrobytes: All good now struct
 JBM: struct: i'm afraid he kinda is
 JBM: Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I want to use the picture he has for his othello
 struct: Astrobytes I didnt see that game has rng&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Get JBM to make you a logo :smirk:
 struct: Now I don't like it as much
 JBM: i'll wait until my proposal wins the vote on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Wiki_Logo">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Wiki_Logo</a>
 Astrobytes: struct, you mean the tile picking?
 struct: yeah
 JBM: not doing that much more free work until then
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Can you compensate for that by giving players identical tile? Would it work struct?
 struct: I have no idea
 struct: The fox uses 140 ms 
 struct: 1900 ms on first turn
 struct: wait
 struct: do I have a bug
 struct: I see he uses 1900ms two times
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes:&#160;!
 struct: Ah
 struct: he measures opponent time I think
 JBM: but what does the fox SAY?
 struct: not sure
 JBM: yeah that sums it up
 Astrobytes: Please god not that
 LeRenard: I use 1900ms in the first turn and 140ms after
 JBM: what would you like to be talking about?
 LeRenard: Response time first turn is ≤ 2000 ms.Response time per turn is ≤ 150 ms.
 Astrobytes: Just in reference to the reference JBM :P
 JBM: monody knows both you and i know the other got it
 JBM: *nobody
 JBM: i've got a norwegian friend
 JBM: that might explain some
 Astrobytes: Yep. I have a couple of Swedish ones
 JBM: well *that*'s norwegian
 JBM: i had no choice but to learn
 struct: but this LeRenard
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/hBhPzVL.gifv">https://i.imgur.com/hBhPzVL.gifv</a>
 Astrobytes: Also, "monody" - trying to get monads involved here somehow?
 JBM: and dyads too
 JBM: just for the sake of global confusion
 Astrobytes: "Monody" is what you call a Functional slip
 LeRenard: Before your change I start the timer after height
 JBM: i see it as ope opposite to homophony
 JBM: *one
 LeRenard: and now just after while(1)
 JBM: come on kbd
 LeRenard: it is maybe the problem
 struct: LeRenard you need to start after the for loop
 struct: the first for loop
 JBM: ok struct
 JBM: now i'm seeing a replay
 JBM: they don't exceed the diameter
 JBM: but it's still weirding me out
 struct: Yeah jbm, that is because its a fake flip
 struct: it doesnt really flip the piece
 JBM: no kidding
 JBM: can't you just flip it and be done with it!
 struct: I cant flip it
 JBM: why not?
 JBM: who's preventing yu?
 struct: Dont know how to code it
 struct: My brain
 JBM: i'd do that for youjust to not see that any ;ore
 Snef: that kindness
 JBM: what's your current routine
 jacek: whats wrong with the flip
 JBM: just look at it
 JBM: then take a RL coin and flip it
 Snef: yea the rotate isn't what it should be it's like they aren't flat on the ground

 struct: it uses skew
 JBM: not appropriately
 JBM: is there a *fast* and easy way to generate a very short game to generate it?
 struct: if you download and open project it should do it
 struct: just run main
 JBM: just lauched maven
 JBM: dl'ing the internet, brb
 JBM: wait, alREADy
 JBM: my oh my
 JBM: that fr localization of ffx is delightful
 JBM: "some page is slowing down your whatevs"
 JBM: "stop it" "have patience"
 struct: ties seem to work :D
 Astrobytes: I don't even mind the animation, just flipping colour works for me - but I appreciate the appeal of aesthetic quality.
 struct: Yeah, switching colors slowly would be fine
 struct: Also I did small changes like placing piece is not instrant
 struct: instant*
 struct: I think this makes it easier to spot where its placed
 Snef: you could do a lightning strike on the tile
 Astrobytes: With the Mars Lander sfx
 Zenoscave: JBM what is that base64 bytes you're sending?
 Zenoscave: some sort of key?
 Snef: seed&#160;?
 Zenoscave: I think
 Astrobytes: Did you update your code for the new inputs Zeno?
 Zenoscave: new inputs when?
 Zenoscave: I think I did
 Astrobytes: donno but you should have these:cin &gt;&gt; roadLength &gt;&gt; initialStones &gt;&gt; gameSeed &gt;&gt; gameSide &gt;&gt; reserved; cin.ignore();
 Astrobytes: (well, in your lang)
 Zenoscave: lol I did road_length, initial_stones, *_ = map(int, input.split())
 Zenoscave: I just ignored them
 Astrobytes: pewpew
 Zenoscave: pewpewpew
 LelouchVC2: Black Lives
 Zenoscave: Matter
 Snef: only real AI matter
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes Do you know what that base64 is in JBM
 Zenoscave: it's 256 bytes after decoding
 Zenoscave: seems like raw binary data
 struct: zeno still no othello bot'

 Zenoscave: othello?

 Zenoscave: sweet!
 Astrobytes: which input is giving you a base64 value Zeno?
 Zenoscave: no JBM's bot prints some base64 data
 Astrobytes: Ahhhh
 Astrobytes:  no
 Astrobytes: lol,
 Astrobytes: I'll check that one out tomorrow
 JBM: Zenoscave: it's "nvm trying out some boss stuff"
 JBM: you're not really supposed to read too much into it
 Zenoscave: first move
 JBM: oh i know what it does O:-)
 Snef: JBM i found a bug
 Zenoscave: I'm going to though&#160;;)
 JBM: Snef: shoot
 JBM: Zenoscave: really, you mostly can't
 JBM: just beat the other people around
 Snef: i play vs your bot you output 1 nvm me testing future bossand then it send 3 stones, but only decrease your stones by 1
 JBM: naaaaw
 JBM: ignore the boss
 JBM: it cheats
 JBM: beat the other players
 JBM: the boss HAS THE POWER
 JBM: though if it sends 3 it should decrease by 3
 JBM: what does the viewer say?

 JBM: are you playing in IDE or is it a rankings' match?
 Snef: IDE
 JBM: yeah i can't have the viewer on those
 JBM: the boss cheats
 JBM: it has to
 JBM: when the leagues are in, it's got to let normal people by
 Alshock: it's reading the player's output?
 JBM: and beat the ones who cheat
 JBM: that's not possible
 JBM: what *is* possible, OTOH...
 Alshock: nothing's impossible if you have WILL
 JBM: well, you'll find out if you really want to
 JBM: the point is, it cheats, and you can't
 JBM: so ignore it (for now)
 JBM: if you don't cheat too much, you'll beat it in due ti;e
 JBM: *time
 JBM: (i.e., when the leagues are actually pushed)
 Alshock: hey you see that shining stone ther at the bottom of the pond?
 Snef: so it is normal that he throw 3 and it only decrease by 1&#160;?
 JBM: i saw that video too
 Alshock: look at it! it's so beautiful, oh nvm you can't reach it anyway so just ignore it
 JBM: snef: don't read too much intp its inputs
 JBM: Snef: the viewer data is supposed to look consistent, that's all
 JBM: just try to rank above ZeroDoc
 JBM: who cheats (but fails)

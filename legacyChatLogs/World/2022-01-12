 ASM_MOV_INT: play clash of code
 Wolfrik50: Hey, has anyone tried Detective Geek question?
 Wolfrik50: I'm able to pass all testcases except 1 validator, and I have no idea how to resolve this
 5DN1L: Wolfrik50 Which validator are you failing?
 ZMONSTER8U: im assuming this isnt too good for people who have little to no knowledge in coding
 5DN1L: this website is more for practising
 ZMONSTER8U: ah, thanks 
 ASM_MOV_INT: let's pull the ol clash n dash
 bmacho: pastebin link dead 
 bmacho: they delete after n hours? 
 bmacho: 3 or less&#160;?
 Husoski: my link from over 3 hours ago still works
 bmacho: no its dead
 Husoski: ...although it did go into an endless tailchaser loop the first time I tried to view it.  weird.
 bmacho: oh
 bmacho: working again
 Husoski: yeah...weird!

 codeing: hello all
 codeing: sup&#160;?
 codeing: just have a question. Can i get the location of an IP address&#160;?
 codeing: my computer has been stolen and i have the IP of the connected person.
 derjack: geoip?
 codeing: thx
 codeing: but geoip give the server adress but not the specific adress if the wifi connection.
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course...
 BlaiseEbuth: IP is far from enough to locate precisely a pc, you'll just be able to locate the relay location.
 BlaiseEbuth: Sorry, but if you didn't have a location service configured on your pc, you'll probably never find it back...
 Urutar: Maybe report to the police so they can try and find it aswell?
 BlaiseEbuth: Can always dream...
 codeing: IP adress is an specific indentify of a PC on a server.
 codeing: Today the server used to use my computer is SFR
 codeing: i can already call SFR and send them the IP adress
 codeing: what do yoy think guys
 BlaiseEbuth: How did you get this ip&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: From a connected account?
 codeing: the thief used on my google account
 BlaiseEbuth: If yes, as I said, the displayed IP is just the relay one, not the pc one...
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah...
 C26_1: Ah
 C26_1: If you can't find the PC/laptop back
 Jerrasterix: if you have MSFT acc connected with windows 
 C26_1: At least block them when they login any website using your google account
 Jerrasterix: you can Locate your laptop 
 Jerrasterix: like you would with apple devices 
 codeing: what is MSFT acc&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: microsoft
 codeing: Blaise, i do it
 C26_1: Step 1: Call the police. If you don't want to do that then go to step 2.Step 2: Buy a cheaper PC/laptop and login as your account as you know the name and the password.
 codeing: i locate my laptop with MSFT
 C26_1: Yes
 codeing: but each time i refresh, i get new one location
 codeing: same city 
 C26_1: Cuz the theif is running from you
 codeing: but the street number is different
 C26_1: running away*
 codeing: how to deal with it&#160;?
 C26_1: Hmmmm
 C26_1: Reload for many times
 C26_1: If there's sometimes the location is not change at all
 C26_1: Then you know the theif is stop running
 C26_1: And call the police at that location
 C26_1: Ummm, thats just my opinion. So do if you want. But it's risky
 BlaiseEbuth: Such location can't be precise... But if you have an area, of course call the police...
 C26_1: 1km-area would be enough for the police have time to cacth the theif
 C26_1: catch*
 C26_1: Or use SOS. Can computer (PC/Laptop) use SOS?
 codeing: this is the ip adress
 codeing: 77.133.249.55
 C26_1: ok
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you use this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/find-and-lock-a-lost-windows-device-890bf25e-b8ba-d3fe-8253-e98a12f26316">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/find-and-lock-a-lost-windows-device-890bf25e-b8ba-d3fe-8253-e98a12f26316</a>&#160;?
 codeing: gonna check
 C26_1: Wait. Does codeing's comp is using Win 10 anyway
 C26_1: If not then we're very sad to you
 codeing: win10 yes
 C26_1: yes
 ATmax: yes
 C26_1: Do you unlock the "Find My Device" before the theif stole your comp
 C26_1: If yes then using another device to use that (Attention: Plz login your acc before using that feature in another device that) you can use

 BlaiseEbuth: Frogs!
 C26_1: @derjack, I maybe lacks of joke but why the frog get strucked by lightning after crying and touch the Frog statue?
 BlaiseEbuth: And there's interstellar music.
 derjack: you dont know pepe frog? oh
 C26_1: Ah I know the frog but I don't know what's the meaning of the video you send to
 derjack: i dont need to have one
 derjack: this meme is mostly absurd
 BlaiseEbuth: Meaning? It's so 20th century...
 5DN1L: Aren't we in the 19th century now?
 C26_1: @5DN1L, can you help me?
 5DN1L: With the frog?
 C26_1: Cuz I have a solution but every input (even the simplest one) tells me that "the process has timed out"

 C26_1: I'm test my solution to my contribution
 C26_1: But sadly all inputs has failed
 5DN1L: time out may mean your while True loop never terminates
 Kururugi: what problem is it for
 C26_1: It's my contribution

 C26_1: You can checked the contribution if you want to see the problem
 C26_1: I have problem with 2d array somehow
 derjack: so you made contribution you cant solve?
 C26_1: yea
 C26_1: wait
 C26_1: Gonna delete the while True
 C26_1: I forgot to use def() function 
 Nachosauce: Today is the day I get legend in coders strike back
 5DN1L: Your battles are still in progress
 5DN1L: Hope you can get there!
 Nachosauce: I don't think it'll be this submission, but I'll get it today&#160;:) I was rank 3 gold on the one before this. Just some minor math tweaking and I should be good!
 5DN1L: nice :thumbsup:
 Nachosauce: oh I just saw you pop up in my battles!
 5DN1L: :joy:
 5DN1L: my CP gonna go down then
 Nachosauce: One of your pods sat at checkpoint 1, targetting checkpoint 2, but didn't move until my pod bumped it. Is that intentional?
 5DN1L: wow
 5DN1L: nope
 5DN1L: not intentional
 Nachosauce: uh oh :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L: probably a bug
 R0m_Hein: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Nachosauce: Happens to the best of em 
 Nachosauce: I really need to go through and refactor all my code for this but hoping to squeeze through into legend before I do. I wrote it before I got a development job so it's a little wonky.. And by a little wonky I mean real wonky. But it works?
 5DN1L: after all it's a comparison between you and those in the same league as you
 5DN1L: so it works as long as you're better than them
 5DN1L: but it may not work in higher leagues
 Nachosauce: I did a very functional programming approach rather than object oriented because I didn't understand classes. And not a very good functional approach :joy:. My second pod knows nothing about my first pod, and neither pod knows anything about the opponent pods. But I'm decent at trig and angles so that's carrying me pretty hard lmao
 5DN1L: And may those tweaks get you to legend :wink:
 Nachosauce: If this submission doesn't get it I'll have to finish it up at work :worried:
 5DN1L: You can work on your pods at work?
 5DN1L: wow
 Nachosauce: Kinda, they're pretty understanding at work that if you're stuck on something, sitting there and staring at it usually isn't the answer. A lot of the time if you take a quick break to work on something else, as soon as you switch back you'll go "oh, duh." and solve the first problem :joy:
 Nachosauce: But time for me to go get ready for work. Have a good one!
 5DN1L: Nice
 5DN1L: You too!

 C26_1: I might have a headache after this
 C26_1: @5DN1L, can you help me this time?
 C26_1: the first assert statement
 5DN1L: Let anybody here who can help help you
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: sr if I annoy you
 5DN1L: Not annoyed at all, but this is a public chat, it's open to all
 5DN1L: Your use of try/except has made the code bypass assert
 5DN1L: if you remove try/except, AssertionError appears

 5DN1L: Confused by ...?
 GamerKingX: i join a few min ago clash and i was cofused like hell

 GamerKingX: thank you very much
 Nantoine: Hi Codingame,
 Nantoine: Is there any recruiter on the chat (just for information)
 Wontonimo: chances are no
 Ben-Anderson: How many companies actually use this site for recruiting? (out of curiosity)
 Wontonimo: :shrug:
 5DN1L: see what they claim
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>
 Ben-Anderson: It doesn't say a number on there, but there are some impressive companies
 3141948: WTF recruiters are on LinkedIn 😏
 3141948: Not here
 ninjadip: They are everywhere
 Wontonimo: I'm not here for the recruitment.  Heck, I don't know why I'm here (queue extensional crisis music)
 3141948: Like sugar in hot milk
 Ben-Anderson: the recruiters cannot be stopped
 Ben-Anderson: they're spreading like wildfire
 ninjadip: you're here for the bytes 
 ninjadip: yeah my cuz is a tech recruiter, man they pay him bank, he does a lot more than look on indeed
 Wontonimo: like real-estate agents in 2007 USA ... 
 p.p.o.p.: Can I find clashes by difficulty level?
 p.p.o.p.: I'm a noob!
 jacek: no, they are random
 Jacxk: you can find puzzles tho
 ninjadip: yeah if you're a noob i recommend puzzles
 ninjadip: less stress
 Jacxk: i'm not a noob an I find the easy puzzles hard ._.
 Jacxk: but at least i have more time to figure it out
 jacek: some easy puzzles are medium or hard
 jacek: try the descent, power of thor, temperatures
 Jacxk: i got those, they're legit easy
 Jacxk: unlike CODE BREAKER 
 Mortis_666: try mars lander
 p.p.o.p.: okay, thanks! Did okay with a few of these clashes, but definitely think there is a better learning path!
 p.p.o.p.: To the puzzles it is!
 Manchi_o6o7: guys, if someone could help me out
 Manchi_o6o7: I wrote a function for levelTraversal of a BST
 Manchi_o6o7: but I do not know how to print the node level by level
 Manchi_o6o7: like, level 1: 1, level 2: 2 3 etc.
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48cadaa0-3bc2-4f01-8593-4a8e0ac9c146">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48cadaa0-3bc2-4f01-8593-4a8e0ac9c146</a>
 5DN1L: you clear your temp queue level by level
 Wontonimo: try "fax machine" Jacxk 
 Manchi_o6o7: ou when temp gets empty, then I have a new level
 5DN1L: When you're clearing your current queue, set another queue for the next level nodes
 5DN1L: then when the current level queue is cleared, you move to your next level queue
 Wontonimo: i really like mars lander Mortis_666 and Jacxk .  Let me know if you'd like any pointers&#160;!
 Jacxk: will do Wontonimo, looks easier than Code breaker :eyes:
 5DN1L: Code breaker was authored by Wontonimo :smirk:
 Wontonimo: oh, that code breaker puzzle.
 Jacxk: yeah i see that, its just that its too hard to be in the easy mode
 Jacxk: at least for me 
 Wontonimo: yeah, i could give you some tips on that if you like
 Wontonimo: the success rate is really low on it&#160;:( 
 Jacxk: sure, is the shift constant? like it's always 1 number or it can be different?
 Wontonimo: it is different for each, so your program has to find it given the data
 Wontonimo: a key here is in the constraints:The shift and multiply are both less than or equal to the length of the alphabet
 Jacxk: in the example the shift is 1 to left for each letter, so it can be 2 left, 3 right, etc?
 Wontonimo: it can be up to the length of the alphabet.
 Wontonimo: yes
 Jacxk: well that makes it harder
 Jacxk: the first 3 tests I found that it was constant on each letter using the provided word but then it's all over the place
 Wontonimo: so if you have a functiondecode( alphbt, msg, shift, mult )the you could check each shift and multiply to see if the word is in it
 Wontonimo: and if it is, then you've found the shift and multiply to decode the message correctly
 Jacxk: i don't really understand what the multiply is either
 Wontonimo: okay, are you familiar with Caesar cipher?
 Jacxk: yea
 Wontonimo: cool, and you were able to solve the first few test cases
 Wontonimo: which means you can find the shift
 Wontonimo: which means you can solve the equation (X+A)%L , where A is the shift and L is the length of the alphabet 
 Wontonimo: so, you just need to update the equation of decryption to be ((X+A)*B)%L where B is the multiply
 CharlesRoman: a4w
 Jacxk: hmm I'll try every single multiply&lt;length and see if that works
 Wontonimo: there you go!
 IllusionSquid: Anyone using multi threading for bot programing like Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe?
 struct: I dont think its possible
 jacek: its possible, but you get only 1 core/thread for your bot
 IllusionSquid: Well, that doesn't seem efficient at all if I would also need to implement parallel MCTS for it to work
 jacek: then make the sequential MCTS faster
 jacek: how many playouts do you have now? do you use bitboard
 IllusionSquid: Never heard of a bitboard.
 Uljahn: do you use pragmas, AVX-2, opening books? :smirk:
 IllusionSquid: Looks interesting
 struct: he is using C#
 jacek: im sorry
 Uljahn: im sorry
 IllusionSquid: Yeah, worst choice haha
 struct: not worst
 struct: Plenty of C# bots on legend
 Uljahn: worst is python :disappointed:
 IllusionSquid: I mean, I am not super familiar with C#.
 Wontonimo: hey IllusionSquid, the question of number of playouts per frame is more to find out where you are and what would be a good suggestion for you.
 struct: i would say he has 1k&lt;
 Wontonimo: for reference, you can get to bronze with 20 playouts.
 Wontonimo: to get into legend you need about 20k playouts and a bug-free MCTS implementation
 IllusionSquid: My monte carlo can get 280 -325 iterations done at the start of the game.
 IllusionSquid: In 70 ms I am giving it
 Wontonimo: 2nd move is what we use as a guage
 Wontonimo: okay, that also works
 struct: yes you need 20k with vanilla mcts
 struct: on 2nd turn
 Wontonimo: you have 1000ms in the first move btw
 struct: for legend
 IllusionSquid: Yeah I am aware if the first 1000ms, but I wonder how much that would help since there are so many ways to go.
 Wontonimo: :D
 jacek: if youre 1st player, go for center
 IllusionSquid: 20K How???? I am struggling with getting C# to be fast
 jacek: also you can try 'teccles' opening heuristic
 Wontonimo: you may find this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a> helpful.  It is something I made to show the power of bitboarding.  It can play 200,000 playouts in 100ms for a 3x3 tic tac toe
 jacek: that is, choose move in the miniboard that will go back to that miniboard
 Wontonimo: I use that same concept (but MCTS instead of MC) for my UTTT bot
 struct: IllusionSquid just wait until you find Connect 4
 struct: For uttt there is plteny of tricks to
 struct: bitboards is the first step
 Wontonimo: there are 2 benefits of bitboarding:it makes lookups of win/loss super fast
 IllusionSquid: Hmm I will have a look at bitboards. Already saw a massive improvement when I swapped out an int[] for a valuetuple
 Wontonimo: two, it makes your data structures super small (and hence less cache hits and hence MUCH faster code)
 Wontonimo: IllusionSquid - you may find this video very motivation <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc</a> to get you even more convinced to use bitboarding
 IllusionSquid: I seem to have a lot of problems writing high perfomance code for C# compared to other languages I have used. Y'all maybe have resources I can use?
 struct: also allocate all the memory for yuor mcts at the start
 struct: i only know c++ sorry
 jacek: what other languages do you know oO
 Wontonimo: and then check out this video about "branchless programming"&#160;!  It is an eye-opener about optimization <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVJ-mWWL7cE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVJ-mWWL7cE</a>
 IllusionSquid: Yeah, I  would love to learn C++ but my current project required me to learn C# so this is a way for me to learn.
 jacek: Wontonimo sounds like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array</a>
 jacek: many/most optimization tricks that would work on c++ or other languages, will work on C#
 Wontonimo: ^^ IllusionSquid 
 Wontonimo: oh, I hadn't given sorting much thought regarding branch prediction&#160;!  Nice link jacek :tada: 
 IllusionSquid: Thank you all, this is very helpfull, I was kinda getting lost on where I could beat more iterations out of my code.
 jacek: do you create new objects in loop?
 Wontonimo: my python UTTT bot could only do about 200 evals / game frame.  My current bot that uses all the above tricks (not the sorting one) does 70,000 per game frame
 IllusionSquid: My code can actually be found on Gitlab if you are really wondering where I am fucking up.
 Wontonimo: you didnt, it just isn't optimized yet
 IllusionSquid: Pretty much
 prozacian: hi 
 Wontonimo: struct, jacek, and others here helped me also.  I learnt a lot here about this kind of optimization.  Keep on trucking!
 RSBat: jacek I'm insetring into std::unordered_map in a loop and at about 100 in legend in uttt
 RSBat: and illusion is in silver
 jacek: inserting doesnt create new objects&#160;:?
 RSBat: so I'd say they shouldn't worry about that for now
 jacek: mhm
 BlaiseEbuth: Knuth approve.
 RSBat: now that I think about it, I'm resizing map at the start, so with all the compiler optimizations I don't know how much stuff is created on insert 
 Wontonimo: yeah, you can get to legend without optimizing out 'new'
 prozacian: hey i have a question i want to get a good computer for college, whats a good recommendation 
 Wontonimo: working keyboard and screen.
 prozacian: uh ok
 IllusionSquid: Wontonimo are you able to give me a brief explanation of bitboards? 
 prozacian: i can if u want

 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: Here that Wontonimo? 5DN1L? darkhorse64 will do your job better than you do. :smirk:
 ninjadip: i heard 'in the butt'
 Wontonimo: let's get back to talking about coding
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Wontonimo is stuck in a loop. He's repeating himself... :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000 reboot him.
 Automaton2000: what's the point of this site
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: last warning blast_beat
 Wontonimo: BlaiseEbuth
 ninjadip: who is blast beat
 5DN1L: some innocent guy
 ninjadip: i'm so close to finishing my bot for ocean of code Wontonimo
 ninjadip: sounds like a rapper
 ninjadip: blast beat's in the house!! lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. You want to kick me Wontonimo?&#160;:(Well if that can make darkhorse64 consider you as a better mod I think it's OK...
 5DN1L: he's actually online right now ninjadip :thinking:
 Wontonimo: kicked
 Wontonimo: back to taking about coding.
 Wontonimo: Congrats ninjadip
 Wontonimo: what algo are you using for ocean of code&#160;?
 codeing: hello wontonimo
 BlaiseEbuth: You did it! :scream: I thought you were a kind guy, but you're as abusive than we were in our mod time...&#160;:(The power is corrupting you!
 ninjadip: what do u mean what algorithm? i didn't read any of the hints. this is all me
 ninjadip: i'm not going by any suggested route if that's what you're asking
 Wontonimo: ah.  more wondering if you are using a general strategy that has a name, like NN, GA, constraint propagation 
 Wontonimo: or if it is all hand coded heuristic
 ninjadip: it might be one of those, but i'm not familiar with it
 ninjadip: right now i think it's just heuristic
 ninjadip: track_enemy, fire at enemy if in range, etc.. scramble if needed...
 jacek: no game tree search, no graphs traversal?
 Wontonimo: :O
 Wontonimo:&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop flooding with emojis Wontonimo, first warning.
 Wontonimo: ninjadip if you can simulate the game locally then you could battle different fine tuning of the heuristics against eachother
 ninjadip: game tree search? like a look up table
 ninjadip: graph traversal? yes i keep record of the map and traversed water over open water... 
 BlaiseEbuth: Naa. Like MCTS, minmax, beam search.
 Leeeooo: Fuck you all&#160;!
 Wontonimo: I haven't tried ocean of code.  It would be a good one to practice working with FOW
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: so if you get un-legended on the leaderboard cleanup, do you get the XP again when you submit it again later?
 BlaiseEbuth: Naa... This kind of thing can't happen on CG... :smirk:
 ninjadip: ty Leeeooo
 5DN1L: he's banned
 5DN1L: he can't see your ty
 BlaiseEbuth: Except if he use the secrete way...
 BlaiseEbuth: Or create another account...
 Wontonimo: any thoughts on working with heavy FOG games?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I thought people hate FOW even more than they hate hexagons?
 Wontonimo: my thoughts are, first try heuristics with hand tuned hyperparameters
 Wontonimo: then make local simulator, and search the hyperparameter space
 BlaiseEbuth: FOG is Fog Of Garlic?
 Wontonimo: then divide heuristic into features and actions, adding a decision layer between the two (NN or random forest), then using local simulator to find an optimal decision
 jacek: people hate hexagons?
 5DN1L: What's FOG game? I tried to google that but seemed there weren't any relevant results
 Wontonimo: Fog Of War
 Wontonimo: where you don't have perfect information
 5DN1L: ah i see, thanks
 Wontonimo: sorry .. FOW
 Wontonimo: not FOG
 Wontonimo: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: 'Hexagon' is an alias of 'France', that's why Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker hates them I think jacek...
 BlaiseEbuth: Ask euler Wontonimo, he's a real FOW.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: hey, I'm french too.  zut alors
 BlaiseEbuth: Ya ya ya :3
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/72p4whq.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/72p4whq.jpeg</a>
 Wontonimo: here is a hex game I coded a few years ago <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://panchishin.github.io/hexis/game.html">https://panchishin.github.io/hexis/game.html</a> .  Win with 6 in a row or a circle of 6.  Rules are changable under "settings" (click them to toggle)
 jacek: a llitle bit like havannah?
 Wontonimo: oh, you can play on-top of the opponent so long as you didn't in the last round
 Wontonimo: and you can't play on top of the opponent if their piece is surrounded
 Wontonimo: the computer opponent is from before getting into MCTS or joining CG, so it isn't optimized at all
 MSmits: well, we're not optimized either :P
 MSmits: My brain runs on vb.net
 MSmits: especially after work
 BlaiseEbuth: Could be java heh...
 MSmits: or kotlin, because my head hurts
 BlaiseEbuth: Or... groovy  :scream:
 Wontonimo: the game is adapted from a game my sons fencing teacher invented.  I decided to make a web version because I felt his rules were broken.  
 MSmits: there's a life lesson in there somewhere
 Wontonimo: that is why there is not a rule "cannot take a piece if you took a piece last turn" because otherwise it is just dumb
 MSmits: don't get game designs from your sons fencing teacher?
 Wontonimo: indeed
 jacek: like, a ko rule?
 BlaiseEbuth: I see fencing -&gt; hexagon -&gt;France... Makes sens.
 Wontonimo: yeah, like a ko rule.  another idea was limiting the number of replacements to a fixed amount, like 6
 MSmits: I think if you were to design a game like this, you'd start with the 6 in a row + circle and see how balanced the game is. Then add other interesting features. You'd need to test with strong bots and human players
 MSmits: human players to see if it's interesting, strong bots to see if it's interesting for strong players
 jacek: it is hexagon, of course its interesting
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: but it has to be maximally interesting
 MSmits: otherwise it's a wasted opportunity
 Wontonimo: I really like the card mechanic that limits moves like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama</a>
 MSmits: yeah onitama is great
 MSmits: i especially love the fact that it makes it possible to have a very tiny board and still have a game playable by bots
 MSmits: though some card combos are solved on turn 1
 MSmits: so they are excluded in the live game
 Wontonimo: it can appeal to both beginners (because it feels like random and the pain of loss is lessened because of believable unluckiness) yet it is hard to master
 BlaiseEbuth: I can't read that in another way than "Oniii-tama! Yameteee! :flushed:"...
 MSmits: is that a good thing?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aDdPqN9_460swp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aDdPqN9_460swp.webp</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: :no_mouth:
 jacek: yes, onitama is nice tutorial game
 Wontonimo: tutorial of what?
 BlaiseEbuth: An eroge so?
 jacek: thats what i name the game when my bot is 1st :v
 jacek: afaik royale also uses nn there
 struct: bt is the only game you need
 USSR_Chicken: help
 USSR_Chicken: i broke my game
 USSR_Chicken: anyone know how to use unity?
 struct: nope
 Wontonimo: use git to revert your last changes
 USSR_Chicken: my weapons look wierd in game but in blender they look just fine?
 MSmits: probably has to do with vertices that are duplicated for UV purposes
 Wontonimo: perhaps the triangles do not have a backface in unity but they do in blender
 USSR_Chicken: ah
 Wontonimo: what MSmits said
 USSR_Chicken: let me look real quick and ill let you know
 Wontonimo: do they look like they are missing parts with transparent triangles all over?  then that would be the problem.  else it is something else
 USSR_Chicken: it kind of looks like it but the model itself is all over the place
 USSR_Chicken: you know how in some games you get those random black lines from some stuff messing up? thats how it looks
 MSmits: you're on windows right?
 USSR_Chicken: can confirm
 MSmits: print screen, paste to paint, cut the interesting part, put on imgur.com, paste link here
 MSmits: good skill to have to quickly share something visual
 USSR_Chicken: shift + win + s dont work for me which is what the hotkey is D:
 MSmits: printscreen is a button on my keyboard
 MSmits: dunno what yours is like
 jacek: try alt+f4
 MSmits: dont :P
 USSR_Chicken: sure
 USSR_Chicken: i will lol
 MSmits: ok, seeya in a bit
 USSR_Chicken: *alt F4's*
 USSR_Chicken: wait i found it
 USSR_Chicken: nvm
 USSR_Chicken: it was what MSmits said earlier
 MSmits: cool
 USSR_Chicken: but it still has some texture issues so ill have to find out how to fix that
 MSmits: yeah that stuff is not easy
 USSR_Chicken: i used to skin cars for fivem, now im making a whole game to shoot animals with different low poly guns :joy:
 USSR_Chicken: gun club vr just not virtual reality and its the offbrand version
 Wontonimo: i prefer a game where animals hunt and shoot people
 BlaiseEbuth: +1000
 MSmits: for some reason this bothers me more than trying to run over people in GTA
 jacek: why not both? shhot the furries
 Wontonimo: if it is on itch share a link
 USSR_Chicken: imagine a hunting game where you are getting hunted 
 BlaiseEbuth: Or people who shoot people. But not animals
 USSR_Chicken: :joy:
 MSmits: carmageddon 2, best game ever
 USSR_Chicken: jacek i agree with that statement earlier
 USSR_Chicken: anyway ima go work on my textures and gain stage 5 brain cancer
 USSR_Chicken: seeya :wave:
 MSmits: uh.. enjoy?
 USSR_Chicken: dont think it will be enjoyable 
 USSR_Chicken: but i will accept "good luck"
 BlaiseEbuth: Brain cancer has a great texture if you plan to add some aliens.
 USSR_Chicken: Myself, i know what you;re gonna do today
 FerasSawan: guys how do you pring everyone on one line in python in for loop?
 BlaiseEbuth: print(thingtoprint, end="")
 5DN1L: pring

 5DN1L: Where does that number come from?
 jacek: mr-joelM try console.log after pi after the pi = parseInt()
 mr-joelM: inside the for loop?
 struct: also you can store it in an array
 jacek: yes, inside loop
 jacek: after the loop pi is out of scope, so it isnt visible
 mr-joelM: so console.log(pi) give me the last 3 of the input but only if checkedd inside the for loop...how can i access it outside the for loop?
 mr-joelM: how do i call it|?
 jacek: as struct said store it in some array
 USSR_Chicken: im back, textures wont work
 mr-joelM: ok.. trying that..
 mr-joelM: ok.... got it... thx a million guys!

 Rebollo: Hi folks..
 Rebollo: Any tip about the resistance?
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-resistance">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-resistance</a>
 struct: hi
 Rebollo: I am not sure if it is better to sort the dictionary
 Rebollo: or start from the message to the dictionary or from the dic to the message
 Rebollo: if ai use map, array or vector..
 Rebollo: if i create a array index using hash
 Rebollo: or something like this
 Rebollo: o try to sorte the dictionary and got timeout
 struct: no idea
 struct: i tried the puzzle only 1
 struct: and tried to brute force it
 struct: but it didnt work
 Kathrin: I do not really get what you mean with from message to dict (or the other way round), but I doubt a simple dict will do. for the long messages you will need a more specialized datastructure. 
 mohammad_alrefae: Hi Guys
 Alex4200: wesh la zone or in english hey the aera.
 Rebollo: I mean, do I look up in the dictionary first and then find the words in the message, or iterate the message and try to find the words in dictionary
 Rebollo: dictionary has 10.000 words
 Rebollo: message has a length of 10.000 characters
 Rebollo: I just created I binary tree
 Rebollo: And added the words of the dictionary on it
 Rebollo: Now I will iterate the message
 Rebollo: And lookup the tree to find correspodence..
 ASM_MOV_INT: in clash of code, why do they count comments as code length? the only skill is remembering to delete the comments...? how is that a helpful skill in the real world
 ASM_MOV_INT: &lt;&lt;-- just forgot to delete comments in a clash btw lol
 struct: in short mode the time doesnt matter much
 struct: You wont forget to delete the comments next time

 Smelty: how do I see what stuff i got wrong on the certification test it says i got 12 points off&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: hey Smelty&#160;!  It's bee a long time
 Smelty: hi!
 Wontonimo: I've not done the certification.  I suspect the info will not be show
 Smelty: sad 
 Smelty: im fine with &gt;99% though
 Smelty: also congrats on getting weekly puzzle
 Wontonimo: thanks!  yeah, that was nice
 C26_1: @Wontonimo, can I send my contribution private link? Cuz mine doesn't have any solution and I have a very headache after fixed my code for several times. After a long time tho, I quit and decide that give up the sol and just private the contribution

 C26_1: This is the link
 C26_1: With better input
 Wontonimo: if you can't figure out a solution, then make a different contribution

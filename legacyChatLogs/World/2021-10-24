 KayKay1202: *time got his hands on my b**y
 bminnix: The US guidelines permit gatherings of unmasked vaccinated people without following safety protocols while unvaccinated people are still being mandated wear masks everywhere.
 Ruskin: That's a funny system.
 bminnix: Yeah... so many ways.
 Ruskin: Sounds like it would be very challenging to police/manage
 Ruskin: And your point above is a good one
 bminnix: Also, no quarantine period for a vaccinated person that has been exposed.
 bminnix: Lol, how BS is that?
 KayKay1202: i want a boyfriend so put on me im lookin for a person who can take my heat i need a rude boy tell me somethin sweet at the same time got his hands up on my body
 aaron9753: kaykay, you like 10, go study.
 Westicles: that's an FBI agent, BTW
 aaron9753: figured
 KayKay1202: do i care no do i want someone yes
 KayKay1202: :joy:
 aaron9753: cool #ingnored
 KayKay1202: go #ignore urself
 aaron9753: nice burn, should try a loop
 KayKay1202: i am #Queenofburns
 aaron9753: #queenofbait
 aaron9753: fixed it for you
 Queen10: IM BBBAAAAACCCCKKKKK
 KAYKAY1202: how
 Broso56: i just know it
 Broso56: lol ikd
 Broso56: idk*
 Broso56: just being troll
 KAYKAY1202: why does everyone keep saying troll bc i dont know what that means
 eulerscheZahl: this is a coding website. and that's what this chat is mostly about
 eulerscheZahl: when you constantly spam the chat with twitch level comments, you are considered a troll here
 KAYKAY1202: oof
 KAYKAY1202: what is loop for if nothin comes up
 jacek: while youre waiting
 KAYKAY1202: yes...
 KAYKAY1202: while ur waiting what 
 eulerscheZahl: jacek is talking about a spin-wait I think
 KAYKAY1202: i dont get what we do on loop bc for me there is nothing there
 eulerscheZahl: are you talking about some default code? you have to complete it
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even know which puzzle you are working on
 KAYKAY1202: i dunno how to explain it
 KAYKAY1202: gn see yall tm
 aetrnm: Hey guys, is there a filter on all puzzles, I want to look through puzzles with a specific topic (Pathfinding)
 aetrnm: It's a question :cold_sweat:
 ProCoder03: go a puzzle with pathfinding tag and click pathfinding 
 TheBlueBias: Here you are <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html</a>
 jacek: you need pathfinding to find puzzles
 TheBlueBias: :upside_down:
 VizGhar: what is maximum number of turns in solo games? (when creating own)
 jacek: 600?
 jrke: i think timelimit per turn * turns should be &lt; 30 thats the limit i think
 jacek: 600 is hard limit. euler has tricks to override that
 VizGhar: tnx jacek...
 dong1: 这个编程的时候为什么是中文
 jacek: MSmits is it legit opening book?
 TechnoBot: dong1 What r u saying?
 jacek: that 3 3 is best move
 cruelnerd: 3"
 cruelnerd: 31
 JHBonarius: I broke my bot&#160;:(
 jacek: oO
 JHBonarius: :scream: I was working with old code!! :dizzy_face: Another hour down the drain
 JHBonarius: 3 year old bot...
 JHBonarius: How can I find which bot I submitted last to the arena?
 bearnilu: history
 JHBonarius: It is just the last one in the history?
 bearnilu: yes
 bearnilu: there is time also
 JHBonarius: So that doesn't get updated every time you press "play my code"?
 jacek: only in arena
 JHBonarius: haha, all entries in the history say "3 years ago"
 JHBonarius: I've been gone a long time
 TechnoBot: ok
 TechnoBot: :o
 TheBlueBias: You came back to see the site collapsing... :smirk:
 JHBonarius: is there a problem?
 TheBlueBias: Depends of the point of view.
 jacek: if you work for CG you propably get more :moneybag:
 TheBlueBias: :money_mouth:
 JHBonarius: yeah, so you're not giving any information
 JHBonarius: plz stop being vague
 TechnoBot: :no_mouth: what r u guys talking about?
 TechnoBot: i am a porkchop now. :bacon:
 jacek: fall challenge isnt bot challenge, just escape room
 jacek: they abandoned community contests
 TheBlueBias: Meh. No more community contest, then less contests, then less quality in contests, then escape contest instead of bot one. Less resources allowed to the multi part of the site. Cg being sell to an us company. More and more problem on the platform... Should I continue?
 jacek: mods quality dropped
 TheBlueBias: Yeah. My departure made the level drop brutally.
 JHBonarius: turning into a "hack the box" site?
 TheBlueBias: Hack the box?
 JHBonarius: I don't know what an escape room is yet
 JHBonarius: hack the box is a CG like site for pentesting
 JHBonarius: hackthebox.eu
 jacek: nah. it goes more into hiring platform
 Uljahn: and team building
 TheBlueBias: Which is the business of their buyer...
 JHBonarius: Ah. Like linkedin
 JHBonarius: I think 3y ago the businessmodel behind CG was already to facilitate recruitment
 TheBlueBias: It was.
 Raghuveer: or x in range(pac_id+1):
 Raghuveer: spring challenge
 JHBonarius: are ther having cash flow problems? Or the founders just want to move on?
 Raghuveer: 292
 Raghuveer: 2020
 Raghuveer: help
 JHBonarius: yeah, in "2020" many people cried for help
 bearnilu: lol
 Not.Charles: Hey, new to CG, and honestly coding in general. i was hoping this was going to be a way to get introduced to coding but it seems like i'll need a little language understanding before i do. any one suggest a more suitable game platform to get more introductory lessons?
 TheBlueBias: No idea... But the thing is they're going on the 'hiring' direction dropping all what is too heavy...
 JHBonarius: Not.Charles what language?
 jacek: try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/">https://learnxinyminutes.com/</a>
 TheBlueBias: MK get out of this body! \o/
 Not.Charles: I mean i am fresh, i have computer background but it is like IT side, i am trying to convert to this side. I was starting with javascript from what i researched
 JHBonarius: In my experience the problem with hiring  is that employers want people, but are not flexible on terms
 Not.Charles: thank you jacek!
 JHBonarius: They all want somebody with 30 years of experience, that want's to work for nothing 120 hours a week
 Not.Charles: i am still here though incase there is any more suggestion, i have been trying to gather quality resources
 JHBonarius: Not.Charles agian: what language
 Not.Charles: javascript
 JHBonarius: beginner?
 Not.Charles: like, Fresh
 JHBonarius: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/">https://www.w3schools.com/Js/</a> is well known
 Not.Charles: not like, hey i am trying to get better with computers, Fresh.
 JHBonarius: what are you going to use ti for?
 JHBonarius: it
 JHBonarius: javascript is pretty specific...
 Not.Charles: I just want to start there
 JHBonarius: "languages as a whole" is VERY broad...
 Not.Charles: i would like to learn at least a handful of languages. it's like going to school to be a doctor but not knowing what you want to specialize in. I just know i have found myself more passionate about wanting to keep learning this direction and pushing myself to start
 JHBonarius: Yeah, but learning multiple types of languages is a lifetime task
 Not.Charles: i just thought it would be important to start with languages. then figure out applications or web dev maybe, once i understand what is going on at least on the front end
 Not.Charles: not that i am saying i am going to quickly digest them, but i want to become as familiar as i need to be.
 JHBonarius: What background and what purpose 
 JHBonarius: I mean, it's just so much information, that you'll drown if you don't narrow down your spectrum
 jacek: start with javascript. and/or python, quite easy
 JHBonarius: Depends on the purpose. Those are very high level. I've encountered people going down to C-like languages, missing essential knowlegde...Then they try to fix things and do that in a very bad way, resulting in UB, memory leaks, etc
 JHBonarius: anywho, I need to go. cu l8r
 TheBlueBias: :wave:
 jacek: :sleeping:
 Bon[]Crayon: automatonnn&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: is dead&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: only 2000, but i'm optimistic that we will get the better of that bot as well one day
 TheBlueBias: CG'll die first...
 eulerscheZahl: maybe CG chat
 PositiveSpin: is it possible to disable the autocomplete features of the editor? 
 bearnilu: yes
 bearnilu: check left side of editor
 PositiveSpin: ok, that should help: "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off"
 Waffle3z: when you fix a bug and the bot starts playing worse
 eulerscheZahl: when you haven't seen a user for a long time but still remember the nick+avatar
 JHBonarius: Waffle3z same here
 jacek: Automaton2000 when will chat die
 Automaton2000: it's not a good sign
 jacek: eeyup
 bearnilu: Automaton2000 gimme my cg back
 Automaton2000: but i don't have time for this contest
 jacek: no one has
 Waffle3z: not a whole lot of participation in counting tic tac toe
 jacek: uttt flashbacks
 MetehanBayraktar: guys what is the benefit of solving questions continously on clash of code to us what do you think&#160;?
 jacek: you can write unreadable code faster
 Westicles: can anyone besides thib remove duplicate WIPs?
 eulerscheZahl: other staff members i would say
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure jupoulton and SaiksyApo know how to do it
 Westicles: it would be cool if one of them did an occasional scrub
 eulerscheZahl: and delete code vs zombies
 eulerscheZahl: wait wrong title
 eulerscheZahl: troll vs castle
 eulerscheZahl: that's the one I meant
 jacek: i have nothing against castles
 eulerscheZahl: the intention of WIP isn't to park your game on the contrib page for years to come
 Waffle3z: didn't realize cttt was only 17 days old
 Waffle3z: managed to steal 4th place without doing any lookahead
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: easy 4th place: night of war
 eulerscheZahl: serious balancing issues
 jacek: yeah, who approved it
 Jay10890: :grinning:
 MetehanBayraktar: guys seriously asking what is the benefit of clash of code if give give ourselves to it
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get the point of upgrade/downgrade when the latter is cheaper
 eulerscheZahl: you can always undo an opponent upgrade so there's no point in using it
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see any benefits in clash of code
 Jay10890: eular
 eulerscheZahl: hi unbanned jay
 Jay10890: .
 Waffle3z: coc is fun when you win all the time but then it's grindy to stay in 1st
 Jay10890: is your pfp a poison frog eular
 Astrobytes: "eular" eh
 Jay10890: ah yes
 Jay10890: i seen you before
 Astrobytes: "Larry Eular" wasn't good at maths, became a farmer instead
 eulerscheZahl: it's the hypnotoad from Futurama
 Jay10890: whats futurama
 eulerscheZahl: TV show from Matt Groening (inventor of the Simpsons)
 jacek: whats the Simpsons?
 Waffle3z: what is a television
 eulerscheZahl: what's a jacek?
 Jay10890: the simpsons are
 Jay10890: people who simp
 Astrobytes: can we ban him again yet? Asking for a friend.
 eulerscheZahl: i won't rat you
 Jay10890: ban me?
 eulerscheZahl: *rat you out
 Jay10890: euler
 Jay10890: astro gonna be me?
 eulerscheZahl: no, don't worry
 Jay10890: he said can we ban him again
 eulerscheZahl: he's joking. but with a grain of truth
 eulerscheZahl: so let's get back to coding related chat
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: i've tried the rubik optim
 MetehanBayraktar: guys i am asking if it is beneficial for our brain , our logic , our coding speed , making algorithms faster so on&#160;?
 Astrobytes: How is it euler?
 eulerscheZahl: just some random moves, got around 200 points per testcase
 eulerscheZahl: might be better to have a command to stop playing. and reduce the score for turns taken
 Astrobytes: MetehanBayraktar: I would say (personally) that puzzles and multis/optimshave better learning potential
 eulerscheZahl: for puzzles there are better places like codeforces. but optims/multiplayers are great here
 DomiKo: you can't find puzzles with nice graphics anywhere else
 eulerscheZahl: true. the few jewels here
 eulerscheZahl: just well hidden in a pile of old clashes that somehow got promoted to puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: oh, and the rubiks cube stops the animation 1 frame too early. so you don't even see the final state
 Astrobytes: Hm. Both seem easily addressable issues.
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and a few spelling/grammar mistakes in the statement/referee
 eulerscheZahl: apart from that i think it's ready
 eulerscheZahl: "eulerscheZahl sended an invalid command"
 Astrobytes: Nice. Just minor issues then. The boy did good.
 eulerscheZahl: yes. and that 3D rotation is a pain to wrap your head around and implement
 Astrobytes: he did that pretty quickly too
 eulerscheZahl: yes. sometimes i forget that he's still a kid (took me a while to realize, probably i always was offline when chat revolved about that)
 jacek: or that kid this young isnt troll
 Waffle3z: alright lookahead is hard in cttt, branching factor big
 eulerscheZahl: then prune it
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. only allow moves next to occupied cells
 jacek: discard edge moves in first rounds, theyre not needed until the very end
 darkhorse64: Waffle3z: You have found an even better heuristic than mine for CTTT
 Waffle3z: or anyone between us I guess
 Waffle3z: it's really simple too, basically just picking the cell with the highest potential to either benefit me or get in the opponent's way
 Waffle3z: or both
 darkhorse64: Same idea. I mostly use scoring 
 Waffle3z: is there an explanation somewhere for what the score numbers represent? is it like some elo variant where instead of 400 points representing a 10:1 win rate it's some other choice of numbers?
 Waffle3z: like maybe 10 points represents a 2:1 win rate or something
 Waffle3z: actually 10 points might be like 100:1 looking at cttt
 darkhorse64: It's based on Microsoft TrueSkill but I don't know much
 jacek: 2 points is like 75%
 Wontonimo: well, i forgot my password on this site.  rats
 Scarfield: that was a short password
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Waffle3z: the boss isn't very strong in cttt. I tried one that just chooses the cell closest to the middle every time and it beat boss 2
 Astrobytes: it's just there to beat basic random bots
 Waffle3z: it beats both of the bosses by going in the middle
 Astrobytes: It's literally just to filter out bots that just output random moves from the top league, that's all
 Astrobytes: Kind of an unwritten rule for multi contributions
 Astrobytes: Especially for board game type games
 Waffle3z: it beats you
 Astrobytes: I haven't written anything sensible for it yet
 Waffle3z: sensible enough to beat the bosses
 Astrobytes: And for some others.
 Astrobytes: I literally haven't done anything on here other than resubmitting my BT bot a few times in the last few weeks
 Astrobytes: Priorities elsewhere
 jacek: now beat othello boss
 Scarfield: yea othello boss was not easy
 Astrobytes: Was alright for me. The darkhorse64 who wrote it was a different story :P
 Astrobytes: Must get back to Othello at some point, that bot is a f'ing mess
 Astrobytes: Scarfello :wave:
 Scarfield: Othobytes
 Scarfield: yea same, but also BT, C4, CTTT, and that other board game i cant remember the name of, there are many at this point&#160;:)
 jacek: :cheese:?
 Scarfield: clobber
 Astrobytes: The lack of proper official contest kinda demotivated me recently
 jacek: was any multi chosen as alternative to the contest?
 jacek: unofficially of course
 Astrobytes: not as far as I am aware
 Astrobytes: Not sure if the cat finished his or not, it was kinda lacking as it was
 Scarfield: havent heard anything about that
 jacek: quite simple game. it needed graphics and balance
 Scarfield: could be cool, but hardly the same&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: It needed a lot more yes jacek
 Scarfield: btw did you mean chess jacek, :cheese:&#160;?
 Scarfield: because that keeps going down on my todo xD
 jacek: eeyup
 Scarfield: so much work in it, but i still want to improve it eventually
 struct: hi
 Scarfield: oi
 TheBlueBias: Procrastinafield
 Astrobytes: #pt guys
 Astrobytes: :P
 Scarfield: pt?
 Astrobytes: portuguese
 Astrobytes: You said "oi"
 Scarfield: oh
 Scarfield: Prochristinafield
 TheBlueBias:&#160;?
 Scarfield: oi is both a waving dude, and a slang way to say hi in english, had no idea it is portuguese
 Astrobytes: "oi" is more of an aggressive greeting in English tbh
 Astrobytes: "Oi you! Gonna smash yer boatrace in!"
 Scarfield: lol, not what i intended xD
 TheBlueBias: Punchfield
 Astrobytes: :fist:
 TheBlueBias: Astrofist
 bearnilu: Astro bite me
 Astrobytes: No
 Scarfield: FirstoButh
 Astrobytes: Fist of the North Scar
 Scarfield: lol had to google that, nice reference, but it wooshed me
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 TheBlueBias: Omae wa mou shindeiru...
 Scarfield: if its not one punch man, i wont get the anime reference
 Astrobytes: I'm terrible also. I only know a few
 Scarfield: oh did see jojo actually, but not really my cuppa tea
 Astrobytes: Urotsukidōji: Legend of the Overfiend traumatised me too much back in the day to continue
 Astrobytes: Project A-ko too, but for wildly different reasons.
 Scarfield: also watched the dota netflix series, and a movie about Vesemir from The Witcher now that i think of it
 Astrobytes: I have dabbled in neither of those
 Scarfield: both are decent, if you play dota the dota series is cool, if you played the witcher the vesemir if cool, not sure if you havent played either
 Astrobytes: I've played dota yes, not The Witcher
 Scarfield: Withcer 2 and 3 are some of the best games i have played, never played the first though
 Astrobytes: yeah I hear good things about the (game) series. Been a while since I did any gaming tbh
 Astrobytes: anyways, out for tonight, gn all&#160;:)
 Scarfield: ye me to, gn&#160;:)
 Waffle3z: fixed a bug, stole 3rd in cttt, just passed jacek, still just using a basic heuristic that counts how many possible points a cell can get and how many cells around it aren't empty
 Waffle3z: assuming there's an advantage to going first, when going second you can just mirror your opponent's moves and force a draw in the 2nd round, so that kind of defeats the purpose of having 2 rounds
 Waffle3z: if you're ahead by round 1 you can force a win
 struct: well the opponent would also have to play the mvoes you played
 Waffle3z: I mean if you're ahead round 1 and moved first round 1
 Waffle3z: if you're ahead by the end of round 1 and you move second in round 2 then you force a win by reflecting your opponent's moves
 Waffle3z: if you move second in round 1 then you can still reflect your opponent's moves and just throw out the round and take your chances in round 2 where you get to move first, but then your opponent can reflect your moves and force a draw
 struct: I see
 struct: you will play 2nd game diferently
 struct: based on 1st game
 Waffle3z: if the player who moves first in round 1 wins round 1, they can force a win by drawing round 2
 Waffle3z: example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/587680452">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/587680452</a>
 struct: so you can always force a draw as p2?
 Waffle3z: yes
 Waffle3z: if you move first in round 1 and don't win though then you have a second chance to come back in round 2
 struct: its harder to win as p2 right?
 Waffle3z: hard to tell. I tested a bot against itself and there was a bias for p1 to win more often, but p2 can always force a draw
 Waffle3z: round 2 can only help p1 in case they don't win round 1
 Waffle3z: which is funny since it's supposed to make it more fair
 struct: I see
 struct: its like the 2nd round is useless now due to forced draw
 struct: I guess noone realized this before
 struct: Dont know how the author can fix this tbh
 Waffle3z: actually I can force a draw as player 1 too
 Waffle3z: make a random first move, copy everything else, make a random move every time they copy me
 Waffle3z: so this game is dead. I can force a draw as p1 and as p2. 
 ArmaniM: Hello.
 struct: so its a proven draw right?
 Waffle3z: yeah I played it against trictrac and drew
 Waffle3z: cttt is a draw
 Waffle3z: I cam submit draw bot and flatten the leaderboard
 ArmaniM: hello
 struct: as p1 too right?
 Waffle3z: yes
 ArmaniM: ...
 struct: i would submit just to be sure
 struct: hi
 ArmaniM: do you guys know
 ArmaniM: um
 ArmaniM: a shart and easy way to cod?
 ArmaniM: code*
 ArmaniM: short*
 ArmaniM: sorry auto correct
 struct: nope
 ArmaniM: yeah im new to coding ツ
 ArmaniM: hmm 
 struct: just keep coding it will get easier and you will get faster
 ArmaniM: yeah but what would you think is easier to code in?
 ArmaniM: like what language
 struct: dont think there is an easy language
 ArmaniM: hmm well i personally think C+++
 ArmaniM: C++*
 ArmaniM: sorry about the spelling i'm a bit tired 
 ArmaniM: i'm going to test my coding 1 sec
 ArmaniM: hmmm bearly anyone on clash
 aangairbender: c++ wont be easy
 aangairbender: python seems to be pretty easy
 ArmaniM: hmm ill try python
 Waffle3z: currently ruining the leaderboard struct
 struct: you need to print draw on first turn :p
 ArmaniM: wow i always get 0% lol
 ArmaniM: i suck at this
 ArmaniM: sadly, my best is 35%
 ArmaniM: 0% again halp me&#160;;((((((
 ArmaniM: just got 36 secs on escape room
 ArmaniM: join if anyone can <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/1YY-xdz-n4E-F7s">https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/1YY-xdz-n4E-F7s</a>
 struct: Waffle3z if you spam submits everyone elo should become the same right?
 Waffle3z: yes
 Waffle3z: then I can swoop in and win 1 game and go back to drawing and claim 1st
 Waffle3z: unless I'm paired against trictrac or vintarel for that one game
 struct: im surprised noone saw it before 
 Waffle3z: everyone's score should be the same anyway though, because the game is a draw
 Waffle3z: is there something we can change to make it not a draw anymore? like connect 4 has the thing where you can choose to switch places
 struct: well c4 has steal
 Waffle3z: that wouldn't fix it here though
 struct: but it wont fix it
 Waffle3z: switched back to playing normally and only drawing when I win round 1
 Waffle3z: hey I just took 2nd
 Waffle3z: I still lose to vintarel though
 Waffle3z: or maybe it's because I just messed up everyone's ratings and now that I'm getting normal win rates it's out of proportion
 Waffle3z: wonder if I have a chance at 1st then
 Waffle3z: yup
 Waffle3z: rip game
 struct: doesnt seem possible to be fixed
 struct: only solution is to make N random moves on referee side I guess
 struct: when game starts
 struct: But it might be unbalanced
 ArmaniM: hi
 ArmaniM: what are you guys playing????
 Waffle3z: what if a draw counts as a win for player 1 in round 1 and a win for player 2 in round 2
 Waffle3z: no that doesn't work p1 just forces a draw in round 1 and p2 forces a draw in round 2
 ArmaniM: what are yall playin???????????????????
 Waffle3z: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe</a>
 ArmaniM: me? sorry
 struct: I guess you can leave a comment on the contribution so author reviews it I guess
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7262f1d66b7bd09545686dcbb89441db1161">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7262f1d66b7bd09545686dcbb89441db1161</a>
 struct: I guess if the game isnt 10x10 this isnt possible
 struct: But may middle cell becomes too strong on odd boards
 Waffle3z: it's not too strong on 3x3
 Waffle3z: curious how different the game would be on 9x9
 Waffle3z: you could mirror every move except for the center, so the game would kind of revolve around that. you can play regular tic tac toe in the middle and reach a draw there, but then the draw state in the middle still creates another opportunity to score an extra point, and if that's blocked there's another one until it reaches the edge of the whole board, so that becomes the focus of the game
 Wontonimo: hey Waffle3z, what's your algo for CTTT?
 Wontonimo: at a high level of course.  NN, mcts, beam, ...&#160;?
 struct: Wontonimo he solved the game
 struct: unless player 2 can find a win
 struct: but at least game is always a draw if player 2 decides to do so
 struct: player 1 can do the same and make it always a draw
 Wontonimo: well that's cool
 Waffle3z: well I have 2 Wontonimo, one is to just draw, the other is a basic heuristic
 Waffle3z: you can force a draw by mirroring your opponent or moving anywhere if you can't
 Waffle3z: if I want to play normally then I'll do that in round 2 if I won round 1
 Wontonimo: yeah, i saw the draw thing.  that's so cheese
 Wontonimo: but it's by the rules so why not
 Wontonimo: i don't see how that solves the game though
 Waffle3z: besides that I count how many ways there are to draw 3 through each empty cell and how many cells of those are already filled and pick the cell with the biggest score
 struct: because there is no either way for any player to win Wontonimo
 Waffle3z: it's solved because it's a draw, the draw bot cannot lose
 struct: any player can force the draw
 Wontonimo: oh
 Waffle3z: 9x9 might be more interesting
 struct: on 9x9 I think palyer 1 had huge advantage
 struct: player 1 being the first that moves
 Wontonimo: leave it to the CG community to discovered the holes in a game :D
 Wontonimo: that's a pretty cool insight and I'm kinda sad I didn't see that earlier.  it's a glaring hole
 Waffle3z: 9x9 with turn 1 steal?
 Wontonimo: mind you, i spent most of my time playing the game when it was 9x9
 Wontonimo: and i suggested the 1 steal thing
 Wontonimo: i like the idea of 9x9 and 1 steal, but that just assumes that there is a move that would balance the game.  There may not be.
 Waffle3z: sounds like the game needs to go back to experimental mode so we can try out different rules and see which one isn't broken
 Waffle3z: maybe just being player 1 is what is unbalanced and steal would just turn player 2 into player 1 and it would be just as unbalanced
 Waffle3z: if it's not about a specific spot like the center
 struct: I dont think it was
 Waffle3z: oh player 1 gets 1 more cell, they get the first one and the last one
 struct: I guess player 2 could have 2 moves on 2nd turn
 Waffle3z: well that's what round 2 is for I guess?
 Waffle3z: player 1 gets more points in round 1, player 2 gets more points in round 2
 Waffle3z: unless one of them is good enough that they get more points in both rounds
 struct: I think when it was 9x9 there wasnt this score thing
 struct: and it wasnt mirrored
 Waffle3z: maybe that solves the p1 bias
 Waffle3z: I mean that's already what it was for in 10x10
 Waffle3z: the bias is just bigger in 9x9 cause player 1 gets an extra cell
 struct: yeah but you still need to get the max cells possible
 struct: if there are 2 games
 Wontonimo: perhaps everyone loses in a draw :P
 Wontonimo: still same outcome though
 Waffle3z: player 1 probably wins in round 1 and player 2 probably wins in round 2, but depending on how well they each did, one of them can end up with more points in total
 Wontonimo: true
 ProCoder03: did you guys use bitboarding for CTTT&#160;??
 Waffle3z: my solution is pretty basic and perfect play is also pretty basic apparently
 Waffle3z: I look at each cell and count some things like how many ways it can score a point and how many cells around it are occupied and pick the one with the highest value
 Waffle3z: ended up in 3rd so the game's not that popular I guess, especially since nobody noticed it's a draw
 ProCoder03: how do you count the points, using 2D arraies&#160;??
 struct: you can use bitboards also
 Waffle3z: 2 round 9x9 is probably still a draw but not a stupid one, more like chess
 struct: pro coder just arr[10][10]&#160;?
 Waffle3z: if player 1 has the advantage and you take turns being player 1 then the game's about how well you can exploit your advantage or defend at a disadvantage
 ProCoder03: wdym struct&#160;?
 struct: ah how you count the points
 struct: I didnt read properly
 struct: I read how do you "code" :p
 struct: with bitboards I know how to do it efficiently with array not so much
 ProCoder03: if with bitboards I have to research a bit 
 struct: might not be the best board to start with bitboards though
 struct: Best board game*
 struct: connect 4 / breakthrough are probably the best ones
 ProCoder03: Thanks :smile:
 Waffle3z: easy way I found to beat both bosses in cttt is to just pick the cell closest to the middle
 Waffle3z: Illedan might be doing that?
 Raghuveer: sping challenge 2020 wood 1 help
 Thorcode: I think that you solved that Raghuveer&#160;?
 Thorcode: I think your code seem good Raghuveer
 Wontonimo: you can do pretty well if you make your pacman follow the smell of the pellets
 Wontonimo: i'm not kidding
 Wontonimo: make each pellet emit a smell to the nearby connecting cells.  iterate 30 times or so, such that the smell will go mostly across the board.  Then just pick the direction that has the greatest smell.

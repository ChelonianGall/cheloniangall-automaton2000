 IgnacioGb: Hi people, I am starting with js. I have problems printing my solutions in js once they are stored in a container since they dont presve always the order (let be the case of alphanumeric string data). How shall i proceed to print things in the stored order?
 markyy: where do I submit bugs?
 jacek: try discord

 Baxtex: Hi, I'm new here.&#160;:) Currently stuck on a fairly simple game but I am not sure what is wrong. The test case changes errors depending on how much I print to the error console?
 WhiteGlove: which one is it?
 Baxtex: MIME Type
 [CG]Thibaud: maybe you code timeouts if you print too many things in the error
 WhiteGlove: language?
 WhiteGlove: check that you are using the error output to debug
 jrke: yes you will time out if you print many things in error stream
 WhiteGlove: I just solved 2 easy puzzles :D
 WhiteGlove: but my code is nowhere near what I saw... mf solving in 4 lines or less in Java
 WhiteGlove: gotta update my java to Java 9... seen a lot of streams and shit alike
 Baxtex: Yeah this was in C#, needed to print a lot to the console to find my error, But it was confusing because the failing test was indicating that my output was not correct even though the console indicating that execution had continued. Kinda difficult to explain. There was a disrepency between what the test said and what the console showed.
 WhiteGlove: I would recommend using an offline IDE imo
 WhiteGlove: way better
 Baxtex: Yeah
 Baxtex: But then you are not always sure what the tests are testing
 WhiteGlove: agai, check that the "debug text" is in stderr not stdout
 WhiteGlove: again*
 WhiteGlove: you can make them

 gamerboy10: hi
 MikisSMD: is there any reason why the language assist wont load&#160;?
 jacek: C#?
 MikisSMD: yea
 jacek: there is some bug. its reported
 MikisSMD: it makes me cringe not being able to see the available methods :D or not double tab to fill in a for loop
 jacek: normally i use local IDE and just copy paste code
 JBM: just learn your language
 jacek: omelette du fromage?
 MikisSMD: JBM fair enough, but then again when would I write C# outside of visual studio
 JBM: never
 JBM: no one should ever write C#
 MikisSMD: :DD
 MikisSMD: should we just copy paste it&#160;?
 JBM: why would you do that to yourself?
 MikisSMD: because I like kitty cats and eternal suffering
 MikisSMD: aren't those the reasons everyone is here&#160;?
 JBM: probably
 Marchete: most of my first C# bots in CG were written on either CG IDE or Notepad++
 Marchete: also C++ ones
 Marchete: won't recommend it :D
 WhiteGlove: Looking for criticism on my code for 1D bush fire, mates

 eulerscheZahl: hm, this might be related :thinking:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/cBcoK20">https://imgur.com/a/cBcoK20</a>
 eulerscheZahl: did you solve the bush fire?did you look at published solutions?
 WhiteGlove: I didnt solve, so no solutions for me
 WhiteGlove: I just feel my code is way to shit
 eulerscheZahl: obviously you don't handle an f at the end
 eulerscheZahl: and you may get an index out of range at i+j
 WhiteGlove: yep, it's eaten&#160;:/
 WhiteGlove: I do xD
 WhiteGlove: that is why I need to improve those "basic" algos
 eulerscheZahl: so, first of alli &lt; bushFire.length() - 1
 eulerscheZahl: get rid of that -1
 eulerscheZahl: for (int j = 0; j &lt; 2; j++){
 eulerscheZahl: j &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; i+j &lt; bushFire.length()
 eulerscheZahl: i think that's it
 WhiteGlove: ooooh I forgot I could add some boolean to the for loop
 Illedan: Hi euler. What you up to these days?
 eulerscheZahl: not much
 eulerscheZahl: btw my contest suggestion won't happy any time soon
 Illedan: Why?
 eulerscheZahl: only after the official one
 Illedan: Struct missing?&#160;:(
 WhiteGlove: vielen Dank mein Freund
 eulerscheZahl: CG is busy with the preparation
 Illedan: oh
 Illedan: did they set date?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm acutally done with the game
 WhiteGlove: Is there any requirement for uploading a puzzle?
 AggYz: shortest mode is so ass
 eulerscheZahl: the month seems fixed
 Illedan: Which month?
 eulerscheZahl: :zipper_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: not sure what i should say. so i say nothing
 Illedan: It's fine
 Illedan: I'll ask on discord
 eulerscheZahl: WhiteGlove<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines</a>
 WhiteGlove: I need to also provide working code, right?
 eulerscheZahl: also depends on the type of puzzle.clash of code: dump whatever isn't good enough for the rest
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you have to provide your own solution
 eulerscheZahl: at least for classic input-output based puzzles
 WhiteGlove: Long ago I had an idea wrote down.. today I found the paper
 eulerscheZahl: not for SDK puzzles or optims
 WhiteGlove: yeah yeah input/output it is
 eulerscheZahl: ok, now the november statement is semi-official&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: even mid-november while I only knew november before
 Illedan: Helps to ask :D
 eulerscheZahl: many asked before and didn't get an answer :D
 Illedan: At the right time&#160;;)
 MikisSMD: I thought I could cheese the system (because it said to use the least lines of code) :D so I put all my code in 1 line (I know terrible) but then it counted chars
 tutubalin: I got pretty close to dbdr in CGFunge
 dbdr: nice, tutubalin
 tutubalin: my code looks like Rorschach test in ASCII
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: and what do you see?
 tutubalin: some animal with long hears
 tutubalin: probably donkey
 tutubalin: i think that's me. spent so much time and effort and still #1
 tutubalin: *#2
 dbdr: it's a good result!
 dbdr: beaten M*rchete
 dbdr: oh, you didn't submit a high score until today
 dbdr: how much time tutubalin?
 tutubalin: it's 2 weeks since my first attempt. by of course i didn't spend all the time on a puzzle:)
 dbdr: sure. so you didn't send your intermediate versios?
 dbdr: yesterday you still had 54K
 tutubalin: 54k is a normal solution with loops
 dbdr: right
 tutubalin: my new solution is a dirty hardcode, and intermediate solution just wouldn't pass all tests
 tutubalin: or...
 tutubalin: let's say that's my intermediate solution, and later i will come up with a better one&#160;:)
 dbdr: :D
 AntiSquid: eulerscheZahl your game turned to contest? i remember chat from backwhen you said you are going to pester CG
 AntiSquid: was about a week or two ago, someone check records from chat logs, run sentiment analysis and reverse engineer the game
 PayItForward: where do i go to learn the basic for language c
 PayItForward: basics*
 WhiteGlove: for C?
 PayItForward: yup
 twitlydoof: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-beginners-handbook/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-beginners-handbook/</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Battle Tower puzzle actually took me awhile,  so much trouble for 60 lines of code
 WhiteGlove: freecodecamp is good
 WhiteGlove: but you could try coursera too
 WhiteGlove: imo... frecodecamp is the way to go
 PayItForward: awesome thanks! i cant solve anything lol so going back to the basics
 WhiteGlove: the rovers sent to Mars are coded in C
 PayItForward: ill try boths
 WhiteGlove: also, check that, maybe your problem is not knowing the language but creating an algorith to solve the problem
 WhiteGlove: which is what is happening to me right now xD
 fabulus: would anyone recommend learning C, or is it waste of time 
 fabulus: (just for fun, not for a job or something like that)
 WhiteGlove: I learnt C at uni
 WhiteGlove: then continued with C++
 WhiteGlove: C is very efficient since it was design for not so powerful computers back then
 fabulus: but hard to learn if you only coded in c# and python or?
 WhiteGlove: there are no classes, but structs
 fabulus: no static vars only pointers, am i right?
 WhiteGlove: and some other stuff from more modern languages
 WhiteGlove: oh yeah, you will love pointers poiting to pointers pointing to pointers
 fabulus: sounds nice haha 
 WhiteGlove: then, once you have some C basics... go to C++. It is a QoL from C
 fabulus: Yeah thanks for the advice
 WhiteGlove: a friend from uni works at a supercomputer with C++
 WhiteGlove: no problem, mate
 fabulus: you mean quanten?
 WhiteGlove: not quantum computers
 fabulus: quantum*
 WhiteGlove: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MareNostrum">https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MareNostrum</a>
 fabulus: Imagine using there python :D 
 WhiteGlove: C++ is faster
 fabulus: yea it was a joke bcus of that 
 twitlydoof: C to modern C++ will still be difficult transition btw
 WhiteGlove: +1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg.  No reason to learn straight C, when you switch to OOP your brain will explode...I know, I learned C in college in 1988, when I should have been learning Turbo C++... and i already knew ASM, Pascal, &amp; Fortran ... learn c++ or csharp
 WhiteGlove: that is why I told him to learn the basics first... which are not a few
 PayItForward: im in cs50 class and they start in C so we can get an understand of what python and SQL does 
 WhiteGlove: in 2014 you still do C
 fabulus: yeah im into c#
 WhiteGlove: I'm the only Java boi here
 WhiteGlove: please, don't question my transition ,thanks
 fabulus: may i ask why java? i cant get friends with that language
 WhiteGlove: neither I hahaha
 PayItForward: where we transisition to those two programs to make our final project 1 of the following: ios game, andriod, web, or one other aspect which i forgot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Drop drop your beans java boi
 WhiteGlove: I dropped from uni due to financial reasons... then took a vocational school where I did java for 2 years straight
 fabulus: but why you dont use c#?
 PayItForward: not part of the class im in
 WhiteGlove: there is not much difference between Java and C#, but it important tho
 PayItForward: edx Harvard class its free. just started and i picked there
 WhiteGlove: what I hate from Java is the lack of multihinheritance
 WhiteGlove: what??
 WhiteGlove: free hardvard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: java a little more portable
 WhiteGlove: +1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: java has better pseudo random number generator
 WhiteGlove: also most enterprises follow the rule "If it works, don't touch it" so it's all outdated Java
 fabulus: imagine writing: system.out.printlnto print out data :D
 WhiteGlove: tbh, I always said I won't do Java ever... I loved C++... look at me, LOOK AT ME! 
 WhiteGlove: oh yeah... it's highly verbose sometimes
 fabulus: what are you guys working?
 WhiteGlove: I worked as an ETL with SQL and python
 PatrickMcGinnisII: youe ide shoudl save you typing
 fabulus: i used eclipse and i got a stroke everytime
 WhiteGlove: I know some eclipse hardcore ppl tho
 WhiteGlove: I HATE visual studio loading times...
 fabulus: I will never use a free ide again haha
 WhiteGlove: it takes bloody ages
 WhiteGlove: I would recommend visual studio code, portable and does the job
 fabulus: pycharm is not better
 fabulus: but you dont have nice debug tools am i right?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: VS is a pig, eclipse is ok - but your setup needs to be on point
 WhiteGlove: I use IntelliJ forJava, i quite like it
 WhiteGlove: and PyCharm back at the job
 fabulus: pycharm is really a biest imo
 WhiteGlove: never got really into it
 WhiteGlove: what I enjoy about Python... is how easy is to read code
 WhiteGlove: (when it's well writen tho)
 fabulus: yeah thats what i like at pseudo languages or how they re called
 fabulus: any ide recommendations for C?
 WhiteGlove: NetBeans has C extensions
 twitlydoof: you guys got a job?
 WhiteGlove: but as I said... Visual Studio Code
 WhiteGlove: not right now
 WhiteGlove: Looking for a java junior or something while finishing uni
 fabulus: thanks mate
 fabulus: unfortunately web developer @twitly
 WhiteGlove: I started doing shitty htlm and css
 WhiteGlove: then I moved to the data dept. :D
 fabulus: just doing this because there is more demand
 WhiteGlove: but the virus said f** you and sent me and some others home
 fabulus: i love corona&#160;:(
 WhiteGlove: great beer
 WhiteGlove: I'm trying to solve the ANEO Sponssore puzzle
 fabulus: where is it?
 WhiteGlove: I got some correct doing some weird wizardry
 WhiteGlove: Medium puzzlews
 fabulus: is it hard?
 WhiteGlove: I've been 30 mins in... I must say I'm tired due to external reasons but I will continue tomorrow xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gtg, yall have fun.  btw, i do php,html,css,sql and make $.  I do java for phone apps.  webdev is boring but there is more $ in it for self employment.  Pick a graphics interface and the lang. that inteerfaces with it the best.  glhf.
 WhiteGlove: freelancer?
 fabulus: yea webdev is the cash cow 
 WhiteGlove: I would love some tips to get started
 fabulus: use bootstrap if you dont use wordpress
 fabulus: i highly recommend that to you
 WhiteGlove: I hate wordpress, I tried once and no more
 fabulus: otherwise youre wasting time writing non responsive css
 WhiteGlove: even those ads you get on the mail... those are responsive
 WhiteGlove: I made those before going to data
 fabulus: i mean if you're writing your own html and css files
 fabulus: without a cms system
 WhiteGlove: you may have received some made by me haha
 fabulus: haha 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess i should have added JS ... learn JSON, bootstrap can help in some situations, but not necessarily easier
 WhiteGlove: noted
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wordpress is webdev for dummies
 WhiteGlove: well I'm gonna go rest now
 fabulus: goodbye mate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gtg. latrerz
 WhiteGlove: The girl I'm into used wordpress and told me she knows how to do websites better than me
 WhiteGlove: but story for another day, brothers
 fabulus: you have to bear with that to get the xx xD
 mr.mister: What's wrong with someone doing websites in WP?
 mr.mister: I myself started with PHP, then moved to Python, then C#, then went back to Python, and am now doing WP for living. Also, getting payed much more than back in the day when I did Django Python.
 Jaek: There is nothing wrong with WP..but you better create your plugins xd
 Jaek: or read and understand the plugins you add which is sometimes impossible
 DomiKo: ohhh yes
 DomiKo: finally
 DomiKo: top 100 &lt;3
 Jaek: Congrats :D
 DomiKo: thx
 Jaek: i spent a lot of time playing clash of codes to realize that it has it own leaderboard&#160;:(
 ElJafar: Jaek
 ElJafar: can you share your code
 ElJafar: we r trying to learn
 Jaek: lmao im trying to climb the leaderboard but okey ill share
 Jaek: but you have to do the same
 ElJafar: ofc
 ElJafar: Allis how did you solve last question man
 Allis: @ElJafar Sorry, which one was it?
 Allis: Ah, the animal race. It's about ratios.
 ElJafar: yes we thought it was m+n
 Allis: It's a little more complicated than that.
 Jaek: i didn't solve that
 Allis: If one animal is running 90% as fast as the other, and then the other is running 80% as fast, it will cover 90% * 80% of the track in the same time period. That would be 72% in this case, and you just subtract that from the length of the track to know how much it would lose by.
 ElJafar: Thank you, nice to learn
 m0rsmordre: Allis &lt;3
 RustProfi: nice
 Jaek: i've lost the private chat xd
 markyy: I find the previous problem offensive to my kind
 Jaek: XDDD
 Ashen_024: ohw dammm i just noticed the picture markyy LMAO
 markyy: Allis could you please share code
 markyy: how do we mention people
 Jaek: not sure xd
 Jaek: @markyy
 Jaek: not like that xd
 markyy: @Jark
 markyy: @Jaek
 markyy: yea
 Ashen_024: hit them a personal message. possible? 
 markyy: but I notice that when someone types my nickname here the message becomes red and I get a notification sound
 markyy: Jaek is this message red to you?
 Jaek: yeah markyy
 markyy: that's it then
 markyy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0672a5a8-e616-4c74-96ce-10b38832b96c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0672a5a8-e616-4c74-96ce-10b38832b96c</a>
 markyy: that's racist
 markyy: xD
 markyy: jk
 Jaek: ffs
 Jaek: i don't have a qwerty keyboard
 Jaek: and the clash is about qwerty keyboards
 Ashen_024: LMAO 
 Jaek: @markyy wth&#160;?
 Jaek: i don't get it xd
 Jaek: i would get it if it was about simps
 Ashen_024: and that was a long ass copy paste on my end because apparently i dont know how to compare it with a whole range in one statement
 markyy: it was the input and output of a reverse mode problem
 Jaek: im too dumb to get it
 Jaek:&#160;:'(
 Jaek: do you spend time on the puzzles&#160;?
 markyy: Jaek like the output is different just because it's a male name instead of a female, it's okay hehe
 Ashen_024: "Given a list of N words" there's a list now?
 Ashen_024: xdd
 Jaek: HAHAH
 GAL1LE0: mornig
 Jaek: its 3am here
 Jaek: anyways, good morning
 Ashen_024: 7:40am here.. Good morning to ya'll too
 Jaek: this problem is a pain in the ass
 Ashen_024: i'm too sleepy at this point for this problem.. gonna hit the bed now
 Ashen_024: later ya'll
 Jaek: its easy but too lazy to think about it
 Jaek: good night

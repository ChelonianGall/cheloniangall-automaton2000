 JayM9: hi
 Wontonimo: hey JayM9, what's shaking?
 Aiger-Akabane: hi
 jacek: good morning
 micoze-stella: hi
 micoze-stella: now 2:00 pm
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: good afternoon Japan ... it's just after midnight here
 Wontonimo: weird that the sun is in different places in the sky for different locations ... as if it's a sphere or something
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid what algo did you use in SpringChallenge?
 Aiger-Akabane: Wontonimo i think AntiSquid is not here 
 micoze-stella: wow, So it's just March 2nd there?
 Wontonimo: yeah micoze-stella , all day
 Aiger-Akabane: i think Spring Challenge is near 
 jacek: 6th may, exactly
 Wontonimo: looks like it's going to be a mash up game
 Wontonimo: l8r
 Uljahn: tutubalin: guess you could train to do AND (similar to XOR) and use binary representation with some common algo for multiplication
 Uljahn: i mean neural network architectures aren't limited to fully connected ones, you could use memory nodes like in RNN/LSTM
 Rypakka: Guys  i suck at coding
 Rypakka: Im really desperate to be better but somehow i can't
 Rypakka: Any tips? I'm a beginner
 KiwiTae: Rypakka easy take a deep breath and practice
 KiwiTae: its not a sprint
 Rypakka: I've already failed my first term in cs programming )):
 KiwiTae: its ok to fail an exam
 KiwiTae: just redo it on your own, see what u failed, and practice until u do it with no trouble
 Rypakka: Thanks a lot
 tutubalin: are you sure that programming is what you love? or you go there just because it's popular now?
 Rypakka: At first I took it because I like challenges
 KiwiTae: oh in codebusters u loose if your busters walk in range of the enemy base?
 tutubalin: Uljahn that will give you binary representation of multiplication, not actual multiplication of 2 inputs
 Uljahn: :confused:
 Aiger-Akabane: hii UIjahn
 derjack: nn more like approximates the 'representation' of function rather than function itself
 [CG]Thibaud: no KiwiTae, I don't remember this
 Butanium: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7919e375-474f-47ef-8785-1c0543ddecde">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7919e375-474f-47ef-8785-1c0543ddecde</a>
 Butanium: wtf is this coc
 Butanium: reverse mode
 Butanium: lol only the bot manage to do it
 Uljahn: i guess any calculator uses taylor/maclaurin series to approximate math functions, so it doesn't calculate those functions itself
 KiwiTae: [CG]Thibaud ohoh indeed looks like its me ~ must have a nullptr smwhere
 KiwiTae: [CG]Thibaud merci o/
 [CG]Thibaud: no pb&#160;;)
 MarTiaNe: I need help with puzzle 'Code4Life', when bot is at 'molecules module' it still prints last connection why? I have conditions for it debuging and everything seems fine
 [CG]Thibaud: too many outputs during a turn so your code is desync with the input?
 MarTiaNe: Yeah 
 [CG]Thibaud: ensure your print one command per turn, at the end of your logic. Not inside
 MarTiaNe: :thinking:
 Uljahn: make a variable to store your output command and print it at the end of the game loop instead of immediate printing inside if-else or other game logic
 Uljahn: this way it's easier to debug and harder to fail
 MarTiaNe: Yeah I see, I just don't get why it entered that condition again
 Uljahn: just use debug output to print terms of the condition, it's better than guessing
 MarTiaNe: Yeah I got it, I thought target was my position it was oponent's :grimacing:
 tutubalin: my next CoC will be 1000th
 tutubalin: anyone wanna celebrate it and challenge me?
 tutubalin: oops. sorry. 1000th was the last one
 MarTiaNe: :laughing:
 Wontonimo: 1000?  so, 5 to 10 min per class ... you could have made a lot of waffles and ate them in that time.  Just saying
 Wontonimo: well, tutubalin, I would have lost vs you
 Kitkat260: gm
 MSmits: mmh well thats creepy. VS is asking me if I want to enable AI assisted intellisense
 Kitkat260: what?
 MSmits: I think I'll just let the VS AI code my bots
 darkhorse64: If it does not require to drill a hole in your head, why not&#160;?
 Kitkat260: no!!!!
 MSmits: is that how you make all your decisions darkhorse64?
 MSmits: check the drill hole in head heuristic?
 darkhorse64: Integrity matters to me
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: just installed new PC
 MSmits: seems to be able to run 4 meta mcts without any issues
 darkhorse64: We need to write more board games to keep your PC  busy
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 jacek: 4 cores? what is it, 2020?
 MSmits: no it has 10
 MSmits: i want to leave some for actual use
 MSmits: maybe i'll run 5 meta mcts, dunno. Guess I could start yavalath again
 MSmits: the other computer had 4 cores, could run 2 meta mcts without issues, but it got really slow at 3
 Wontonimo: what's a meta mcts?  is it a hyperparameter search of settings for mcts?
 jacek: its mcts but instead of using random playout, you use another mcts
 jacek: it is mostly use for opening book generation
 Wontonimo: :nerd:
 Kitkat260: haha
 Wontonimo: are the two mcts' identical otherwise?
 jacek: yeah
 Uljahn: i guess it's about evaluating openings with a very huge amount of games, building very deep tree and using solvers for endgames
 jacek: though in meta since its done offline, youd want to exploit symmetries and transpositions also
 Wontonimo: neato.  nice way to also warm the office and vaporize excess coal
 Wontonimo: i've gotta get more more cores and a proper gpu 
 Uljahn: yep, mining mcts-coins
 Wontonimo: that reminds me of a puzzle to make about mining bitcoins 
 tutubalin: can you gamble in Monte Carlo with them?
 Wontonimo: (not actual bitcoin, just the math concept)
 MSmits: mmh some of my meta mcts crashing. Not enough object pool available. I guess because the cpu and memory are faster, it does more rollout and makes more nodes
 MSmits: easy to fix i guess
 Wontonimo: haha, issues of having more cpu
 MSmits: ye
 Wontonimo: that's a tough life MSmits ... I can help though
 tutubalin: jacek what about metametamcts? how many levels of mcts is ok?
 Wontonimo: just mail me your computer and I'll send you mine
 MSmits: eh tutubalin, 2 levels is plenty&#160;:)
 jacek: tutubalin some guy used nested mcts for some single player games like solitaire or samegame. 3 levels  if i remember correctly
 MSmits: yeah i suppose you can do that for SP
 MSmits: that's different 
 jacek: if your cpu is fast but has low memory, use meta-meta-mcts. it will slow down giving more accurate simulations
 Wontonimo: if at every level you recursively add MCTS to MCTS, then it just becomes regular MCTS again&#160;!
 Wontonimo: wait ... no, let me think that through some more
 oddoneout: how exactly do i advance from league to league in ai puzzles?
 oddoneout: it says im ranking 1 above the boss but it doesnt advance
 jacek: it needs to finish your submit. then you will see if you advanced and there will be timer
 Wontonimo: ^
 oddoneout: so do i just wait in the arena?
 Wontonimo: no, you can go get a coffee
 oddoneout: oh, cool, thanks
 Wontonimo: but seriously, there's no way to make the timer go slower or faster.  You don't need your browser open to advance
 tutubalin: Wontonimo it becomes DFS, i suppose
 Wontonimo: :D
 dave573: anyone stuck at lvl8 boss?
 Wontonimo: in what game?
 jacek: lvl8 boss? w00t
 oddoneout: wood league dave vs chad lvl8 boss
 oddoneout: probably coders strike back? it feels like a 'default' to me
 dave573: I went as a mage dps, but double for loops doesn't do as much damage as I would like
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: ôÔ
 Wontonimo: i have no idea what you could be talking about dave573
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 tutubalin: lvl8 boss is loop immune. try to memoize him instead.
 dave573: What about whiles?
 farmaceits: i got my arcane mage healer rdy to go
 tutubalin: dave573 whie true continue

 AntiSquid: intent is clear
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, I saw it after.
 JohnathanBarbee: Bam! Get modded
 BlaiseEbuth: Nvm. If he come back we will correct that.
 HunterEhrenfeld: hello
 HunterEhrenfeld: I will give a high 5 to anyone who can guess what exactly my pfp is and how it was made
 jacek: whats pfp
 HunterEhrenfeld: profile picture
 Westicles: python turtle
 HunterEhrenfeld: ヘ( ^o^)ノ＼(^_^ )
 HunterEhrenfeld: python turtle is the devil lol
 Kitkat260: gm
 BlaiseEbuth: For the last time, I have nothing to do with python! :rage:
 Kitkat260: how is everyone
 JohnathanBarbee: Pretty good. You?
 Kitkat260: i'm ok
 jacek: how is Automaton2000
 MadKnight: how's your everydays hi, Kitkat260&#160;?
 Automaton2000: depends how you define it
 jacek: how is AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: hatput you to the best
 Kitkat260: hi madknight
 AntiSquid:  hi MadKnight
 Kaleab: hello old friends
 MadKnight: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: there is a tool for that
 AntiSquid: hell Kebab
 MadKnight: a tool for saying hi? great! where can i get that Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: can you find the bug
 d3d3x: ..
 Kaleab: I had an annoying problem (question)
 Kitkat260: sup
 MadKnight: dude
 MadKnight: it's not even been an hour
 MadKnight: Kaleab shoot it
 MadKnight: what's your question&#160;?
 Kitkat260: nothing
 HunterEhrenfeld: a precise question
 jacek: AutomatoNN what's your question?
 jacek: AutomatonNN even
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a contest on the left side without it to start with easy games
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: oh AutomatonNN , you know not what you say 
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 struct: Wontonimo you asked something last night right?
 struct: before saying later
 struct: I cant remember what it was&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: hey struct , i can't remember but i could come up with another question 
 struct: I dont remember if it was a question, I just remember that I had something to reply&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: i was perhaps asking a poll of what kind of algo people used for Spring Challenge 2020 ... but I've since read the community posts
 struct: Ah now I remember
 struct: It was about the art of next contest
 struct: Its just a placeholder
 struct: You thought it was a mashup or something
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah... it certainly looks that way
 struct: its just a placeholder, it was also used on the fall challenge 2020
 Wontonimo: that's not very cash money of them
 jacek: they need to add ads to cocs
 Wontonimo: don't give em ideas, they may look at how much compute each bot submit takes and make you watch an ad for ever 20 bot battles 
 Wontonimo: watch-to-win :scream:
 jacek: oh nine men's morris soon to end contribution cycle. how did i miss that
 GeorgiD: 2 131 -&gt; 14 91 -&gt; 35 156  -&gt; 1 
 GeorgiD: What is the logic?
 GeorgiD: Probably something obvious 
 GeorgiD: But couldnt notice the pattern
 Westicles: b mod a
 jacek: modulo
 GeorgiD: Ohhh
 GeorgiD: Thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Westicles this 5D chests is kicking my arse
 jacek: 5D chess?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Chests... ( . )( . )
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Westicles: Timing out without symmetry?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, can't do any C&gt;9 for N=20 even with precomputed primes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't know how to find the symmetry of a 5d space
 ErrorRazor: is std::bitset slower than just using something like uint64_t?
 ErrorRazor: I mean on codingame specifically. I heard something about not using stds
 Westicles: Well, I can verify tbali and dwarfie got it working in PHP with some scheme involving hundreds of dollar signs
 darkhorse64: Used wisely, the stl is a good thing. as for bitset, I hope that a bitset(64) is like a uint64_t but you cannot be sure unless you look at the implementation
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, i see they did it... I'm guessing the sheer number rooms gets kinda exponential when c is large
 JohnathanBarbee: @Error, I think stds are slower but easier to use. Just like Intel's FastRand and std::rand
 darkhorse64: Use neither, they are bad, implement xorshift
 darkhorse64: bad in terms of randomness
 JohnathanBarbee: I will definitely look into that
 darkhorse64: std is slow on CG if you don't use pragmas
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can see there are boundaries when N is not prime
 ErrorRazor: I don't know what these do but I have #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er N+1
 darkhorse64: great
 Westicles: All permutations of (x,y,z,w,v) are the same, so you can use that to do less flodds
 Westicles: floods
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok if I find a room and search the 1 dimensional space... could I extrapolate .... hmmm, I'm under/over thinking it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm saving in a visited 5d manner, so I am searching too much
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess if diagonals were allowed that would screw up the symetry
 Westicles: It doesn't look like the other PHP solutions use symmetry.  So just 5 deep loops and a flood fill should work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not even using recursion, just a stack for floodfill
 oddoneout: "Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... oddoneout will no longer be active in this game."
 oddoneout: Or am I mistaken that my bot takes too long to compute a game loop?
 Branzz: Handicap for java code golf plz :grinning:
 Branzz: It means you aren't reading in enough inputs
 ErrorRazor: Either it takes too long or it doesn't output anything
 therealbeef: or it crashes
 tutubalin: try to output some debug info
 oddoneout: nvm, I messed up so bad - i've put returns in my game loop instead of continues, haha
 ErrorRazor: Oops
 oddoneout: I am really much more used to having a few more files than just one code window
 tutubalin: you're welcome! you can use rubber duck next time&#160;:)
 oddoneout: hahaha, thanks
 tutubalin: you can code in external IDE in multiple files and them glue them together with some script that runs on file save
 tutubalin: that sync with CG
 tutubalin: *that = then
 oddoneout: I guess that would be handy but I have a feeling it would have a pretty low ROI
 oddoneout: or I may be a bit too inexperienced to figure that out
 tutubalin: i don't think so. i got some script from github, adjusted it a bit for my needs - et voila!i can code as i used to code
 oddoneout: oh cool! I was 100% certain I would have to do it myself :sweat_smile:
 murrayr: I'm struggling with "Ways to make change". I have a solution that works for all test cases but fails the last validator. The code is fast O(NS) and uses 64 bit ints. Any idea what could be special about that last validator?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: murrayr it's only 2 loops...like 5 lines of code
 murrayr: yes, that sounds about right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: array has 1001 entries of only 32 bit ints
 murrayr: seems to me a test case of 1000, {1..10} needs a 64 bit answer
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dd4f16f6-2c01-4095-9b59-6aa0c8d1b1c4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dd4f16f6-2c01-4095-9b59-6aa0c8d1b1c4</a>
 murrayr: ha ha ha - constraints say N&lt;=1000, so I set my array exactly 2000 to be safe.... 2001 is necessary
 tutubalin: why 2001?
 murrayr: because the constraints lie. N&lt;=2000
 tutubalin: ah, ok.
 tutubalin: i solved it on JS, so it definitely doesn't require 64 bit
 Westicles: I updated the constraints to 2000
 murrayr: I think none of the test or validator cases need 64bit - but they could have done. I can now confidently say N=1000, Vi={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} results in 968356321790171
 murrayr: Thanks Westicles
 tutubalin: that's why i love languages with dynamic arrays&#160;:)
 tutubalin: my JS solution intentionally goes out of array boundaries

 awnion: need opinion plz: is this medium or easy?
 Astrobytes: Since I didn't click on the link I'd say Very Hard.
 Astrobytes: (sorry)
 Astrobytes: OK, just on first look it does look Easy yeah
 awnion: it's my contribution&#160;:) For me, it's not that hard but I'm biased as an author.
 Astrobytes: I know, sorry, was joking around.It does seem to fit in the Easy category
 awnion: OK, thanks.
 Astrobytes: Oh I see that clashers thought it was too hard for clashes
 awnion: yeah but for Clash it was 1M D and could be solved with BF on c++&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Haha!Personally I think it's suitable for easy, wait for some more opinions but I think for a puzzle it should be fine
 awnion: yeah I got 30 days anyways
 Astrobytes: Will give it a closer look tomorrow
 awnion: thank you really appreciate 
 Astrobytes: no worries. Anyway, I'm off for now, cya tomorrow

 Tuo: @darkhorse64 GL
 darkhorse64: thanks. It's a huge refactor so it may be successful
 darkhorse64: *may not*
 Tuo: u will proply pass me when someone else runs
 darkhorse64: Unsure. If I run CGStats, it's stronger against you but weaker against others. I need to do some step by step to see if everything is right. There is also a large RPS effect
 Tuo: you win in 16/20 latest battles
 darkhorse64: Previous version running now
 darkhorse64: This is really a strange game. Sometimes, I run against 3 default bots and I finish dead last. I am supposed to win all games against the boss&#160;!
 easdasd: n word
 cajunphoenix: NO YOU CANT SAY NIGGA
 cajunphoenix: THATS RACIST
 darkhorse64: last warning. stop that or get baaned
 darkhorse64: banned
 Tuo: yeah its very hard to test and find bugs when you cant even run the same seed reliably
 darkhorse64:&#160;? your bot is not deterministic&#160;?
 Tuo: its is but lets say you run a seed and finish last, then do a change that is obviusly bad and finnish 1st :sweat_smile:
 darkhorse64:  "finnish" :slight_smile:
 Tuo: sometimes i try intentionally break my new features to see if they do anything and still first place
 Tuo: :slight_smile:
 darkhorse64: I see what you mean. Looks like my previous version is doing worse
 darkhorse64: This new version is not so bad. I'll let it run for tonight. gn
 Tuo: y seems much better
 AntiSquid: hey tuo
 Tuo: hi
 AntiSquid: how often are you playing hanabi with friends?
 Tuo: i have never played
 AntiSquid: what
 AntiSquid: you missed out
 Tuo: first time i heard about that game was in explanation for fireworks
 Tuo: we dont play it here
 AntiSquid: you just need the 1 deck of cards, no lockdown restrictions and convince your friends to give it a try
 AntiSquid: i thought you play it often because of your lead
 AntiSquid: then again i've been too lazy to finish my bot 
 Tuo: maybe it would help in the beginning (is pretty rough fireworks) but in the long run its better to skip all the "human" strategies
 Tuo: * i would assume
 AntiSquid: these aren't self-trained agents, so i expect everyone added their "human" approach to their bot :P
 AntiSquid: tea-pot at the top :o
 Tuo: yeah. pretty thin margin tho, is normal for 1st place to get +- 0.5 points when someone runs
 Tuo: i mean someone else then top 2
 Solarite-E: I don't think I've learnt anything so far, and i was already told to join a "Clash of Code" and i was so confused on where to start.
 aegle: hi

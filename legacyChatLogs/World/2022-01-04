 Melting_Ice: hello, what is the expert mode?
 5DN1L: The expert mode allows you to display a custom tab in the test panel of In/Out puzzles. With it, you can run your own test case by specifying the input of a scenario and its expected output. It is also used in old multiplayer games such as Poker Chip Race to set specific conditions for a match.
 Melting_Ice: tnx
 5DN1L: (copied from Thibaud's blog, don't sue me for copyright reasons)
 Melting_Ice: why can't i see the animated version of my code?
 5DN1L: what do you mean?
 Melting_Ice: i'm doing puzzles, shouldn't i have a graphic version of the race that i'm programming?
 5DN1L: what's the puzzle
 Melting_Ice: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back</a>
 5DN1L: yes it should be in the top left part of the website
 5DN1L: make sure you've scrolled all the way left and up
 Melting_Ice: i did, it's not
 5DN1L: refresh?
 5DN1L: and also
 5DN1L: you need to submit your code before something is animated
 Melting_Ice: oh, tnx
 5DN1L: or at least pay it
 5DN1L: play*
 Melting_Ice: i did play it
 5DN1L: another reason is that there's an error in your code
 5DN1L: read your console log to see what it says
 Melting_Ice: it got fixed, tnx
 5DN1L: good
 MahirSez: if i create a multiplayer game is it possible to remove/ban a player from the leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: but you can remove the replay player instead&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, an anagram: replay, player
 MahirSez: what do you mean by replay player?
 eulerscheZahl: the video thing where you can watch the game
 MahirSez: so basically if anyone submits their code, it will always be on the leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MahirSez: some sort of admin config would've been nice ig
 eulerscheZahl: only CG staff can remove it. but you have to give a really good reason why
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see the use-case to be honest
 MahirSez: im trying to arrange a private contest. if the link is leaked then there might be other people too
 eulerscheZahl: i see. you can't prevent that. you can however use a filtered leaderboard (by school, company, friends you follow, ...)
 eulerscheZahl: having more players might even be beneficial to have more different strategies and variance in opponents
 eulerscheZahl: when you keep it as a private contribution, you are limited to 10 games per submit, which isn't very reliable in rankings
 MahirSez: i see
 eulerscheZahl: so you should consider publishing it even if it's meant for a private event (if the game is interesting enough for the public)
 MahirSez: yeah i will look into that...thanks

 Rebollo: Guys, do you happen to know, why sometime, using c++, inside of a FOR loop, it does  not respect the i limit..
 Rebollo: using COUT
 Rebollo: i am using 
 Rebollo: for (int i = 0&#160;; i &lt; 10&#160;; i++)
 Rebollo: and it happens to print a lot of rows
 Rebollo: cout &lt;&lt; countEachValueOfB[0] &lt;&lt; endl;
 5DN1L: Did you reuse/modify i inside the for loop?
 Rebollo: no, simples as that:
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/40fcbb2a-b286-4f5f-a4ff-dace9bc6e374">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/40fcbb2a-b286-4f5f-a4ff-dace9bc6e374</a>
 5DN1L: what does countEachValueOfB do?
 Rebollo: In another loop I fill it up for counting the integers repetition dynamically, like&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cdd80d77-455c-43a8-9b21-f15f370d7843">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cdd80d77-455c-43a8-9b21-f15f370d7843</a>
 Rebollo: Once I don´t know a better way
 BlaiseEbuth: What's the result you want to achieve?
 Rebollo: If i want to count the occurrences of number 10000, it will sabe in the index 10000 of the array 
 Rebollo: cout the ocurrences of each integer
 Rebollo: count*
 BlaiseEbuth: Occurences in what?
 Rebollo: lets say: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed656c22-782c-44c4-ab2a-09b7c4c0253a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed656c22-782c-44c4-ab2a-09b7c4c0253a</a>
 GPoll: You want to skip the empty elements?
 BlaiseEbuth: Use a map.
 BlaiseEbuth: std::map
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: I see
 Rebollo: map is what I was looking for
 Rebollo: otherwise
 Rebollo: the array index would only be filled in the indexes that the interger exists
 Rebollo: like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/33fb9996-96d1-49a2-a6e7-a59537f64c00">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/33fb9996-96d1-49a2-a6e7-a59537f64c00</a>
 Rebollo: but how to use MAP without hardcoding? I don´t know wich integer will appear
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/302305d1-57de-400c-b052-8d2a25e6a013">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/302305d1-57de-400c-b052-8d2a25e6a013</a>
 GPoll: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d761ee31-fbb9-43a0-8ac4-ad3552b734eb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d761ee31-fbb9-43a0-8ac4-ad3552b734eb</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: When you get an integer use myMap.count(myInteger) to see if you already seen it. If yes you can just ++myMap[myInteger], otherwise you create it myMap[myInteger] = 1
 Rebollo: I will do it thanks a lot guys
 BlaiseEbuth: And to print it use an iterator. Something like:for (auto integer: myMap) cout &lt;&lt; integer.first &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; integer.second &lt;&lt; endl;
 Rebollo: Can I make another question: Or I am annoying?
 GPoll: ask away&#160;:)
 Rebollo: In C++:I always have to set the aarray size when creating?Is there a way to create [] and just push elements?Also how can I check it length?
 BlaiseEbuth: std::vector
 Rebollo: is it a good practice? performance is ok? Or it is just for newbies?
 Rebollo: mean best practice*
 BlaiseEbuth: It depends of what you want to do. If you need to have a variable size use it. But if you care about perf use an array.
 BlaiseEbuth: You can use std::array to have facilities like myArray.size() for instance.
 Rebollo: I am working on Nintendo Sponsored Contest, far away from understand, but will get there, step by step, learning each concept, I heard that performance would be a issue eventually..
 BlaiseEbuth: Never tried it in years ^^ I heard it's more about maths but :shrug:
 Rebollo: I know it is not for beginners, but I was able to solve the Shadow of Knights 2
 Rebollo: And i don´t care to take a year
 Rebollo: I like to go step by step
 Rebollo: so I can learn, basic, intermediate, advanced..
 Rebollo: Like I have learned a lot about convertion types, loops, a bit of pointers, arrays, bit operations..
 Rebollo: bitwise..
 EBMdollar4LIFE: shadow knights 2 for real
 EBMdollar4LIFE: wait was that 
 Rebollo: what? I didn´t get it..

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: coderpad is just learning there are 1.95 million smurfs from that one 13yo kid
 Nixerrr: I used to use Java and I had a script in IDEA to concatenate java files into one for CG. Now I'm learning C and am using Visual Studio Code. What would be the easiest way to create a similar script that concats C files and headers into a single file for CG? (I'm using CG-Sync)
 eulerscheZahl: for C# i use these few lines of Python:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e3e71cd-d707-49f6-a2e3-56709d1c8273">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e3e71cd-d707-49f6-a2e3-56709d1c8273</a>
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure it's not fundamentally different in C
 eulerscheZahl: and i run that as a post-build event, added it to tasks.json in the .vscode folder
 Nixerrr: Cool, I'm just reading up on tasks now
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea1e16f0-05ec-4e66-86ee-4b3b310f9b0f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea1e16f0-05ec-4e66-86ee-4b3b310f9b0f</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it's the last block
 eulerscheZahl: and the build block that has a "depends-on"
 eulerscheZahl: as another hint: add this in your launch.json
 eulerscheZahl: makes you read from file instead of stdin without maintaining 2 different codes
 Nixerrr: Hope this'll make more sense if I get more familiar with 'tasks' :D
 Nixerrr: Thanks for the advice either way
 Nixerrr: Ah ok, got it now
 Zenoscave: is spring 22 multi?
 Vlad100: Nobody knows. Maybe.
 Zenoscave: Cool see y'all later then
 eulerscheZahl: my last state: they want to discuss the format internally in January
 eulerscheZahl: then i got kicked from mods channel
 eulerscheZahl: (related to me telling that i'm resigning, so not really kicked)
 Nixerrr: Why did you resign?
 eulerscheZahl: long story...
 Nixerrr: I smell drama!
 eulerscheZahl: started on mods channel, thibaud asked who's still in and who wants to leave
 eulerscheZahl: i replied that i've actually prepared my resignation message already if the next contest is as disappointing as the last one
 Rebollo: cout &lt;&lt; num2 &lt;&lt;" * " &lt;&lt; num1 &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; num3 &lt;&lt;  endl;52565 * 45253 = -1916243351
 Rebollo: why negative my GOD
 Re3der: overflow of int
 eulerscheZahl: so a while later thibaud wrote a few other things and also advised us to quit if we are only in for the contests
 Nixerrr: Oh I see. I've been really out of touch for the last few years. Have the quality of contests dipped?
 eulerscheZahl: then astro, ille, neuman n and me decided to go
 Nixerrr: *has
 eulerscheZahl: 2 contests per year instead of 4-5 before
 Rebollo: thanks a lot bro
 Rebollo: any solution?
 Nixerrr: :crying_cat_face:
 eulerscheZahl: there was a statement on the forum that they would still host community contests, if the community does the whole work
 eulerscheZahl: i've spent months creating <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tryangle-catch">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tryangle-catch</a>
 Re3der: what launguage do you use Rebollo
 eulerscheZahl: then it got refused because it didn't fit into their new concept anymore
 Nixerrr: Was it supposed to be an official contest?
 eulerscheZahl: something about most users are here for fun and learning (survey on start page with 200k participants)
 Rebollo: C++
 Re3der: then change int to long long
 eulerscheZahl: i asked if it could be one
 Nixerrr: That's a bummer - I'm sorry
 eulerscheZahl: pitched around july, kept waiting for half a year
 eulerscheZahl: then it got turned down without any feedback about the game itself. just no, retracts players from their 2 main contests
 eulerscheZahl: "canibalize" is how they called it
 VizGhar: 5% dropping to 0 slowly
 eulerscheZahl: yes, from there it went downhill
 eulerscheZahl: i played a few contests on other websites that i wouldn't even consider with a CG in its prime
 Nixerrr: That's a shame. It might be just a transitional period
 eulerscheZahl: CG got acquired by another company in case you missed the news
 eulerscheZahl: coderpad
 Nixerrr: I did miss it. Will read up on the news of the past two years
 eulerscheZahl: search CG discord for "5%"
 eulerscheZahl: 2 years, wow
 VizGhar: hmm I'm not the "multiplayer" guy, but I don't like those decisions at all
 Nixerrr: I've got a new job with 35 hours of work per week so I'll have time to code again haha
 eulerscheZahl: you might have even missed that i became moderator in the first place :D
 Rebollo: Perfect Re3der worked perfectly
 Nixerrr: I think I did miss it tbh :D
 eulerscheZahl: 35h/week is fine, i have the same in my contract
 Nixerrr: Last time I was here, MK and another guy I can't recall were the mods
 eulerscheZahl: i still have prove, mod rights remain on random channels
 eulerscheZahl: join #test123 and i kick you there&#160;;)
 Nixerrr: Amazing :D
 eulerscheZahl: buggy chat :D
 Nixerrr: And now there's a mod icon next to your name, weird
 eulerscheZahl: going to bed now, cat is insisting
 Nixerrr: GN
 eulerscheZahl: i know, but i have no power here
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: same
 Nixerrr: My previous contract said 40hrs/week but it was closer to 50... But these guys are serious about the 35hrs/week it seems
 Astrobytes: that's always a nice thing, hope it lasts though!

 Rebollo: Guys, what´s the way to work with huge numbers in c++?Should I use strings (binary) and manipulate manually? Let´s say 50 + digits..how to perform calculations?
 Rebollo: 256 bits
 surgutti: u can use int128, but if you want numbers like 10^100, then i recomend to make string of digits or vector of chunks of digits
 Rebollo: So I have to find I way to perform calculation like, sum, product, division, etc?
 AndreasNEO: Thanks 5DN1L

 GamingGnawer: Is there a way to have the console not truncate my output
 Sandborg: Did clashes just crash?
 GamingGnawer: It's very impractical to have critical debug information be replaced with ...
 5DN1L: No, you have to work around the output size limit
 GamingGnawer: :sob:
 BadB0y: ola\
 5DN1L: GamingGnawer What I do is to test locally, or use conditions to write the output several times, each time a different part of the output. You may also try encoding the output and decoding it locally.
 5DN1L: Given your level I'm sure you'll know some way to do it&#160;:)
 GamingGnawer: yeah, it's not the first time i work around the problem but in this case i'ts ascii-art and it would be unusually good if I could see it all at once

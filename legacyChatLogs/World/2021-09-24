 MiyamuraIzumi: well, I am from Mars
 StopDiscriminatingAsian: well, I am from a jail
 swaggycat: helloooo
 ProCoder03: I was born in Mars (March in German) :sunglasses:
 OwlGifter2.0: i am really unefficient with 2d arrays in java, i be filling out constraints for every posibility 
 ProCoder03: try 2D arrray in C&#160;!!
 OwlGifter2.0: i dont know C T~T fairly new to programming and java is the first programming lang. im learning&#160;;-;
 ProCoder03: what are you going&#160;??
 ProCoder03: with 2D arrays
 ProCoder03: *doing
 mr.bossman: ah there ar multiple types ... try 2D arrray in C&#160;!!
 OwlGifter2.0: well im doing the reverse minesweeper puzzle
 OwlGifter2.0: and for each x im basically setting all array values around the x to 1 and it has become 99+ lines of code to do the simple ones&#160;;-;
 ProCoder03: That's Java :wink:
 OwlGifter2.0: is it really? T~T im exhausted lmao
 OwlGifter2.0: i think i need another 200+ to fit all the possible conditions lmao
 MiyamuraIzumi: you could see other published solutions after you solve a problem
 OwlGifter2.0: i know
 ProCoder03: Did you finish ASCII art OwlGifter2.0
 MiyamuraIzumi: solve the problem by yourself first, then check for others
 OwlGifter2.0: the problem is im too lazy to code it all and i know there should be a better way of doing it&#160;;-;
 OwlGifter2.0: i gave up on that one hhh
 ProCoder03: Then do it first, its 2D array  
 MiyamuraIzumi: so the main problem is your laziness, not your code
 OwlGifter2.0: ummm i mean yeah i guess
 OwlGifter2.0: i just wanna be more efficient
 OwlGifter2.0: not really wanna code 300+ lines for an easy puzzle&#160;;-;
 ProCoder03: I understand :P
 OwlGifter2.0: and thank you procoder, ill give that a try again as when i gave up on it i hadnt learned arrays yet
 OwlGifter2.0: :D
 ProCoder03: Just tinker around with arrays for 1 week locally
 OwlGifter2.0: ok ill give that a try :D
 ProCoder03: every CG puzzle can be solved 10% with Arrays atleast..
 OwlGifter2.0: ill try my best to learn arrays, thank you :D
 dreadylein: @OwlGifter2.0 if people have the feeling you put effort into it, asking questions here will nearly always find someone willing to help you if you get stuck
 ProCoder03: yeah CG has the most hospitable community ever
 dreadylein: if they dont feel like you wawnna be spoonfed thats true :D
 OwlGifter2.0: i know its just i feel stupid for trying to code it in such an long manual manner&#160;;-;
 dreadylein: eh, dont do that hehe
 OwlGifter2.0: xD
 ProCoder03: I too feel like that sometime hehe
 ProCoder03: Its normal..
 OwlGifter2.0: im trying not to but i felt the same way when instead of using for loops i would use more variables, it was a dark time xD
 dreadylein: i crossed the boarder on 2 decades coding and feel the same, so all good :D
 dreadylein: you will always learn ways to organize stuff nicer
 OwlGifter2.0: ok ok good to know, yeah its not a pleasant feeling
 OwlGifter2.0: and i just found out today that when you complete a puzzle you get access to other peoples answers so i can adjust my code and adapt it from their responses xD

 MohED: what do you mean with spamming
 Illedan: Writing messages without any deeper meaning about life
 MohED: oh, I understand now
 MohED: sorry
 struct: darkhorse64 I think you are right, loa could use a little more time, and it should be fine to reduce max turns to 150
 struct: But I havent managed to make a good bot yet
 struct: I think any time between 150-200 will work
 struct: it wont be much because most battles vs bad bots will take like &lt; 30 turns
 eulerscheZahl: oh, so many eyes
 struct: you have a match today euler?
 Uljahn: a lower triangular matrix of identity matrices :sweat:
 eulerscheZahl: yes. best of 5 today, first match in 4h 15min. will be streamed live on twitch with commenting
 Astrobytes: fame at last!
 eulerscheZahl: and 0.1ETH safe already
 eulerscheZahl: played some test matches vs my opponent from today last week. he had to learn the hard way that he can't play vs me the same way as he does vs others
 MohED: against who you are going to play the match
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/replay/isygv1s24w1l3">https://yare.io/replay/isygv1s24w1l3</a>the thing around frame 90 happened all the time when he got too close
 eulerscheZahl: he won the match where he didn't try to disturb me though. but I improved a lot in the last week
 struct: whats the twitch channel?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not 100% sure. but there was another match streamed 2 days ago
 eulerscheZahl: In English on roxkstar74's channel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/roxkstar74">https://www.twitch.tv/roxkstar74</a>in Spanish on baumannzone's channel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/baumannzone">https://www.twitch.tv/baumannzone</a> 
 Westicles: I wonder if the teads puzzle is still out there somewhere
 Illedan: Gratz on 0.1 ETH. that is some money
 Wontonimo: I really don't understand how yare.io is making money, or how it is going to evolve into something that does
 Wontonimo: it is all very hard-coded.  at least if there were 5 different maps, but it's always the same map
 Wontonimo: yeah, congrats eulerscheZahl on the ETH
 M0H07ED: wait a minute guys does yare.io give you ETH for wining javascript competition
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: it is a promotional match, to attract players one-time
 Wontonimo: it may happen again sometime, but it isn't something you can join this late in the competition
 eulerscheZahl: they are planning some game changes and another contest
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested randomly generated maps, not sure if it will happen
 Illedan: Of the same gameplay?
 Illedan: What about C# support? :D 
 eulerscheZahl: they plan to change the rules. but no details announced yet
 eulerscheZahl: you can use C# if you get it working yourself
 Illedan: hm
 eulerscheZahl: one player is using Rust via WASM
 eulerscheZahl: C# also works with WASM, see Blazor
 NoahSK: hey guys!
 Illedan: I know
 Illedan: Maybe one da
 Illedan: y
 Illedan: Too busy these days
 eulerscheZahl: these 5 months off from work must be really stressful :P

 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: hi
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: Hi 
 Uljahn: pls stop spamming
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: srry just want to talk to some one
 Uljahn: so your "want to be a coder" is a lie all along
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf:&#160;???
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: No 
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I'm just bored rn
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I do want to be a coder 
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: the college I want to go to MIT College
 MasterCyph3r: Bro i'm so glad i found this site!!!!
 demooo: I also wanted go to MIT. I was rejected
 Westicles: brass rats for everyone
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: damn that sucks
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I just some one to talk to I'm bored AS FUCK
 eulerscheZahl: that's not our problem
 demooo: you do realize you are talking to us right now right
 demooo: but you are using all your messages to ask to talk to someone
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: oh yeah sorry I'm in school and bored
 eulerscheZahl: talk to your classmates
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: nah they doing their thing and they don't want to talk about coidng
 demooo: then say something about coding
 chorusjourney: Hi guys, I have create a class before the main class of the Scrabble test, I made getters/setters, but it always responde null when I use a get. Do you know if I can't create/use class that I made? 
 demooo: place your code on a code sharing website so people can look at it
 eulerscheZahl: did you create an instance of that class?
 eulerscheZahl: you can just paste your code here
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf:&#160;????
 chorusjourney: Euler I really post here? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Stilgart: yep
 chorusjourney: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cb31e82-e8b3-4ad0-a9c1-2f081bba0258">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cb31e82-e8b3-4ad0-a9c1-2f081bba0258</a>
 Stilgart: see&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: magic
 chorusjourney: Ahah right I though I'll trash the chat
 chorusjourney: Tx
 eulerscheZahl: value = this.value;
 eulerscheZahl: should be: this.value = value
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf:&#160;????
 chorusjourney: Damn....
 Stilgart: gg euler
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes it's the stupid mistakes, I almost overlooked it as well
 Stilgart: (I missed that one)
 chorusjourney: Tx for your help, very kind 
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I need help with python 3
 eulerscheZahl: int pos = ((int) a) - 97
 eulerscheZahl: does the same thing
 chorusjourney: a is my variable, it's char, that I want to link to a number in a tab
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 Stilgart: a char is an int, actually
 Stilgart: sort of
 eulerscheZahl: but that 97 is the ASCII code of the letter 'a'
 chorusjourney: Aaah yeah I know what you mean now
 eulerscheZahl: and you don't have to write it as 97 (which you can do of course)
 Stilgart: I wanted to say that a char is an integer
 eulerscheZahl: but 'a' is more readable than 97
 Stilgart: and easier to remember too
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we should rename the variable a by c (like character) to avoid confusion
 eulerscheZahl: c - 'a'
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: .........................
 chorusjourney: So you mean that if I write a - 'a' will return to me the difference between my char and the first letter of alphabet? 
 Stilgart: Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: you won't have any answer if you don't ask a specific question
 eulerscheZahl: ask your question and stop asking to ask. my urge to kick is rising
 eulerscheZahl: 'a' takes the ASCII value of that character. it gets replaced by 97 during compilation
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: oh ok
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I'm am  borecd
 eulerscheZahl: you told multiple times
 eulerscheZahl: this chat is not the right place to compensate for that
 chorusjourney: Hum, I understand, I learned things like this with C
 eulerscheZahl: in C you can also do -'a'
 MeBen: The amount of nonsense you guys have to deal with in this chat is astonishing
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes it's hard to be patient. but i don't want to instantly kick/ban everyone
 Stilgart: would be nice to have a title
 eulerscheZahl: title? like PhD?
 Stilgart: sometimes, it is just that people do not know how to interact with a chat
 eulerscheZahl: aah, a header text to explain
 chorusjourney: Very cool tips, don't thougth that it work on Java too, tx a lot
 Stilgart: a banner to tell people to directly ask their question, and so on
 Stilgart: and to avoid MPs 
 MeBen: IRC etiquette, basically
 Stilgart: (they are a real knighmare on CG)
 Stilgart: -k
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1thdi4g">https://prnt.sc/1thdi4g</a>discord has this on #general
 Stilgart: +t
 Stilgart: this should help at least a little
 eulerscheZahl: what annoys me the most: when people keep asking me general questions (e.g. like to get into coding, where to start) in a private message rather than using a public chat
 eulerscheZahl: * i feel obliged to answer
 Stilgart: I can't understand why, but it is really ANNOYING
 Stilgart: I can*
 Stilgart: my english is really broken today&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i see you get those messages too :D
 Stilgart: and tabs that keeps poping for days
 MeBen: Maybe a pop up like you get in Discord that tells you the rules and basic etiquette before you can start chatting would be a good idea 
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I'm the only one here form USA
 Stilgart: pretty sure you get one when you reach lvl 3
 eulerscheZahl: it's more realistic that this chat will disappear and only leave discord for interaction I fear
 MeBen: Would be a shame just for the rare clash interaction I encounter
 Stilgart: Discord is not suitable for chat anyway

 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: HELP
 MeBen: We can't access your IDE session. If you want help, ask for something specific and we can try our best.
 Stilgart: Something wrong happenedOnly the CodinGamer associated with this testsession can access it
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: FUCK
 struct: chill
 MeBen: Calm down
 demooo: I think we might be getting trolled
 Stilgart: would be easier to tell us the title of the puzzle and to ask a concrete question
 MeBen: I think they're just young to be honest, with that name and everything
 Westicles: Astro has banned him like 20 times now
 chorusjourney: And the fact that he's 14
 struct: rules still apply
 eulerscheZahl: Damocles sword is pending over his head already, don't worry
 demooo: You said discord was bad for chas @Stilgart. What makes you have that opinion? It's a chat app
 Stilgart: did i miss something&#160;?
 Stilgart: afaik, discord was an voip app to begin with
 chorusjourney: For me it's less reachable
 STOP4643: ãã
 STOP4643: hi
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i just like this chat. feels more casual to me than discord
 STOP4643: help me..........
 Stilgart: and adding a chat above it makes it slow and ugly (to my eyes at least)
 demooo: Discord is indeed a voip app but I believe that, even at launch, discord had fully fledged chat functionalities
 STOP4643: help
 Stilgart: starcraft 2 has a chat too&#160;:)
 demooo: STOP4643, ask the question you need help with. Don't ask for help without any more info
 Stilgart: but I won't call it a chat app 
 demooo: Discord chat is convenient and supports all functionality that 99% of  individuals would desire from a chat app
 demooo: Not sure where it is even remotely lacking. Chat it a 1st class citizen along with voice
 STOP4643: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris</a>
 Stilgart: either I want 3% of what others wants or chat apps exist since decades
 eulerscheZahl: you mean 1.84%?
 chorusjourney: @euler I pass my first test but I have other problems for the restTx for your helpHave a good day to everybody:upside_down:
 Stilgart: it's 1.64% actually
 Stilgart: (yes, I had to go to discord to check this one)
 STOP4643: It's too difficult.
 struct: try to solve an easier puzzle then
 demooo: Not sure what you mean by that
 eulerscheZahl: indeed, 1.64%. that's even worse
 Stilgart: in my opinion, on discord, the pace is too slow to be a real chat, and too fast to be a forum
 Stilgart: (and for the record, I don't like forums anymore)
 demooo: What do you mean by pace in this context? Is pace not defined by the  members of the chat?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: How old is everyone here
 demooo: old enough to write code
 eulerscheZahl: your age * 2
 struct: well cg discord has a decent number of members but 0 activity
 Stilgart: their reactivity, the length of their answer, and so on
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: eulerscheZahl ur 28
 Stilgart: and don't take it too seriously, it is just my opinion of discord&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i muted most channels
 demooo: So are you specifically referring to the codingame discord, or discord as a whole?
 eulerscheZahl: i mostly use discord as a news feed. contest announcements
 Stilgart: all the discord rooms I went where about the same
 eulerscheZahl: #external-contests is my favorite channel on CG discord
 Stilgart: (less than 10)
 Stilgart: maybe I am unlucky
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: #single_as_Fuck join if u are
 eulerscheZahl: can i kick please?
 Stilgart: but I prefer chat here on this webchat, and read stuff on reddit
 Astrobytes: ban it
 Astrobytes: hi btw
 Stilgart: \o
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 struct: hi
 MeBen: I tried using Pidgin for this chat but since my account is tied to Github it doesn't seem to work
 Stilgart: the cat is angry, the toad is angry, the turtle looks angry
 eulerscheZahl: the troll is kicked
 Astrobytes: Ah yes, a new turtle picture for you Stilgart
 eulerscheZahl: i'm tensed. that's the right word i think
 eulerscheZahl: yare in 30min
 Astrobytes: Good luck!
 demooo: Then I can understand your opinion of the specific CG discord. I was confused because it seemed that you presented it as an argument for the application as a whole
 struct: gl
 Stilgart: MeBen: pidgin doesn't seem to work (but it is another story, this soft is on my forever-blacklisted list)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have many discord servers that i joined
 Stilgart: cool, now I have a kawaii tab \o/
 eulerscheZahl: i kicked but don't have that chat yet
 eulerscheZahl: :tada:
 MeBen: Do you have a suggestions for a different xmpp client?
 Astrobytes: Discord is my 'social media', as is CG
 eulerscheZahl: recently some other mod banned a user and i got spammed to please unban
 eulerscheZahl: then the chat server got a reboot and the ban was lost
 demooo: My primary social media is reddit, followed by discord
 Stilgart: I am using gajim, even though I am not a big fan
 eulerscheZahl: tried it for a bit. always was red in my task bar when a new message popped up
 Stilgart: and I have absolutely no idea what a "social media" might mean&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: back to webchat
 MeBen: What do you put in as password if you use OAuth2 to log into CG?
 eulerscheZahl: gh67ALÂ§
 Stilgart: this chat and irc are probably my social media
 Stilgart: for CG, I am using the webchat
 Stilgart: (I really find it more attractive than discord)
 MeBen: eulerscheZahl: hunter2?
 eulerscheZahl: there is some way to reset your password and turn your github login into email+password
 Astrobytes: The thing that annoys me about the web chat, is the total lack of even relatively basic functionality (removing messages etc)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know the exact steps, never was in that situation
 Astrobytes: And the most annoying thing about that is that we're stuck with it in this state.
 eulerscheZahl: yare stream started<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/roxkstar74">https://www.twitch.tv/roxkstar74</a>
 struct: They should have added account age
 struct: bans are useless
 Stilgart: in fact, bans are usually useless
 struct: at least when i kick/ban on discord i can choose to auto remove the messages
 demooo: what is the subject matter of the stream?
 struct: its an AI tournament
 eulerscheZahl: a bot contest
 eulerscheZahl: i'm playing soon
 Astrobytes: If we could remove the offending messages the chat would have a little more respectability. I shudder to think what kind of impression it makes on some new people when they see it at times
 eulerscheZahl: hey, he can pronounce my nick&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Anyone with a brain can&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: some say uler
 Astrobytes: I know. It's a personal bugbear of mine lol. Must be a Euclid/Euler thing
 MeBen: I don't know the process of becoming a mod, but it seems weird that there's these features to make mods lives easier that just aren't implemented. Do you not have contact with the admins?
 BlaiseEbuth: Admins&#160;? There's no such thing...
 Astrobytes: We do. We were informed that the web chat will never be updated.
 MeBen: Great
 struct: darkhorse64 you here by any chance?
 Stilgart: i didn't see him the last few days
 zomboi1012: me neither
 struct: I need to still figure eval and learn some minimax stuff
 struct: my depth 7 minimax loses to depth 5 ludii minimax&#160;:(
 zomboi1012: ikr it's kinda frustrating
 Astrobytes: What don't you know wrt minimax struct?
 struct: wrt?
 Astrobytes: with respect/regard to
 struct: i only know the basic
 struct: alpha beta
 Wontonimo: not negamax&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The key is getting the eval working very well first
 Astrobytes: and yeah, negamax is cleaner
 Wontonimo: it is a lot more like mcts backprop where you reverse the reward
 struct: my mcts i doing better currently I think
 struct: ill check it
 Astrobytes: Are you using best move from previous depth? Any other move ordering?
 struct: no move ordering at all
 Astrobytes: Well I would strongly recommend implementing some
 Wontonimo: if you do depth 7 and are losing to depth 5, then it is a question of eval
 Wontonimo: if your depth 7 loses to your depth 5, then it could be a bug in eval or your tree logic
 MiyamuraIzumi: dep 7 lose to dep 5 is normal, I think
 struct: I dont think its detecting win properly
 MiyamuraIzumi: a better move in dep 7 may actually not really good in longer run
 struct: I mean lose*
 struct: But I cant ask much from my 1 line eval
 Astrobytes: Yeah as I said first of all, work on the eval, without it you have nothing.
 struct: what score should my minimax returns
 struct: if opponent can win in the next play
 struct: so in 2 plys
 struct: mine + opponent
 Astrobytes: if the opponent wins you need to backprop loss for you and win for him
 Astrobytes: negamax does help here as Wontonimo said, it's a bit more intuitive
 Stilgart: MiyamuraIzumi: it may... but it should definitely not happen often
 Stilgart: struct: -1
 Stilgart: and I agree with negamax
 BlaiseEbuth: Who's negamax?
 Stilgart: the guy who invented the algorithm with the same name&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 MiyamuraIzumi: and ...
 MiyamuraIzumi: I still don't see official announcement on FC2021 format
 aCat: dates are still unknown?
 Astrobytes: Yes. But format is confirmed as: Escape Room
 struct: thibaud said it would be around Halloween 
 ZarthaxX: contest is a escape room??
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 ZarthaxX: so wont last ,uch
 ZarthaxX: much
 Astrobytes: couple of hours. No CP awarded
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 ZarthaxX: hi btw
 Astrobytes: And team based
 ZarthaxX: no troll??
 Astrobytes: hi&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No troll.
 ZarthaxX: tshirts awarded&#160;??
 ZarthaxX: this is so weird
 Astrobytes: Tibo confirmed in chat the other day
 ZarthaxX: no tshirts  i guess?
 Astrobytes: No idea man
 struct: my minimax must be bugged
 darkhorse64: struct: connected
 struct: on depth 3 it cant find a win for some reason
 Astrobytes: Lost interest as soon as it was confirmed as escape
 struct: hi darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: hi
 darkhorse64: hii 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 struct: I finally managed to make a working bot
 struct: I think increasing time might be a good idea yes
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes sameee
 ZarthaxX: i wont be able to participate anyway
 ZarthaxX: but f
 Astrobytes: At least you know you're not missing anything
 struct: also draw at turn 150 should be fine
 struct: since most draws happen by move repetition
 darkhorse64: great, you did better than me. 150 ms for 150 turns fits with CG constraints
 struct: yeah and even then games wont be that long
 ZarthaxX: feels nice actually yeah Astrobytes haha
 struct: because most of them will be under 30 turns
 struct: I saw games lasting 13 turns
 struct: ill need to read these 50 pages to understand the game
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/Analysis%20and%20Implementation.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/Analysis%20and%20Implementation.pdf</a>
 darkhorse64: I plan to add pass, maybe change the color scheme and complete the statement. If I can figure out a decent, I may remove the 2nd league. I do not expect the game to be very popular. By the way, I noticed I goofed with Clobber statement. The turn duration is 150 ms not 100 ms
 darkhorse64: *decent bot*
 struct: oh
 Astrobytes: If it gets potw it'll be *more* popular though
 struct: game is quite hard tbf
 aCat: Ah LOA - i wanted to implement it some day on CG ;p
 aCat: Mark's thesis is complicated ;p
 darkhorse64: Compared to clobber, it is much harder and clobber is not very popular. I guess it's because there is no obvious playing strategy
 Astrobytes: which is what makes it interesting&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: At least, for LOA, you have "rush the center with your checkers"
 Astrobytes: fair
 darkhorse64: If you dig the internet, you will find quite a number of tips for LOA, for instance old issues of Abstract Games <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.abstractgames.org/">https://www.abstractgames.org/</a>
 Astrobytes: interesting
 darkhorse64: ofc, Winands papers are must read
 Astrobytes: always
 struct: also they say on the paper that 30% of the time is spent on generating moves
 darkhorse64: Will 150 ms be enough for MM/MCTS to survive some times against NN&#160;? When I see how NN fare for C4 whose simplicity allows for a tremendous number of rollouts, we may have concerns
 struct: NN will dominate here
 struct: hand written eval will have no chance sorry
 Astrobytes: This goes for a number of games
 struct: well the harder is to eval the game the better the NN does
 Illedan: How many possible moves do you get each round on avreage?
 struct: paper says 30
 Illedan: Just add spells and some RNG and NN wont be a problem
 struct: and dont forget fog
 Illedan: Blind chess maybe?
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: maybe ill finish the NN book instead of reading the loa paper
 darkhorse64: The good news is that you still need to write a fast bot.
 Illedan: What book?
 struct: nnfs
 struct: neural networks from scratch
 Die-Die-Missile-Barrage: Hi
 darkhorse64: Neural Network from Scratch (in Python)
 struct: Grats eulerscheZahl
 demooo: quite intense games
 struct: yeah when euler started losing the middle I thought it was lost
 Illedan: What rank is now?
 struct: he is going to the final now
 struct: not today
 struct: in 2 days
 Astrobytes: well done eulerscheZahl&#160;:)That was ridiculously tense
 struct: it also has these videos Illedan

 struct: I havent read the book yet so I cant comment on it
 65140: yo wassup
 eulerscheZahl: oh, so many missed pings
 eulerscheZahl: thanks everyone
 Astrobytes: some of those games man... whooo
 ZarthaxX: gzzz toaaad
 ZarthaxX: replay plz?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/roxkstar74">https://www.twitch.tv/roxkstar74</a>
 ZarthaxX: tyy
 eulerscheZahl: ends right now but there's a recording of it
 Astrobytes: I was literally on the edge of my seat
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: WSP
 Astrobytes: You'll understand when you watch those games
 ZarthaxX: in this game you could also interact as a human right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, with some effort. The opponent was playing manually in this case, in some little control panel he made
 Astrobytes: Clearly a strong RTS player
 eulerscheZahl: "I was literally on the edge of my seat"imagine me :D
 ZarthaxX: ahhh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKDB2WuPXg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKDB2WuPXg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: opponent's view
 ZarthaxX: wait the guy coded a control panel=?
 Astrobytes: Seriously man, I woulda been shaking!
 eulerscheZahl: it's my usualy bed time. but i don't feel like i can sleep right now
 Astrobytes: I was going back and forth between both streams
 eulerscheZahl: and aecert will hate me when i perform poorly in the finals
 Astrobytes: It's Friday, live dangerously&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that circle player is my nemesis
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw the discord messages on his stream
 Astrobytes: Well, you've got 2 days
 wlesavo: oh nice, grats
 Astrobytes: hey wlesavo 
 wlesavo: hey
 wlesavo: got some easy time at work with more researching and reading, so came back for sometime =) i was hoping for a contest but i understand there wont be one
 wlesavo: so i try to get CoIF legend with heuristic python bot, expected it to be easier than it is
 Astrobytes: Yeah, shame about the contest.That's a tough but great game, you can definitely get legend with python though iirc
 wlesavo: yeah, i still have around 35ms and some ideas how to fill them
 eulerscheZahl: CoIF is one of my favorites
 JBM: what about the contest?
 Astrobytes: It's an Escape Room
 JBM: oh
 wlesavo: euler i remember you saying so, one of the reasons i picked it :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: couple of hours, no CP
 JBM: haven't tried that out yet
 Astrobytes: team-based
 JBM: yeah must be too atisocial to find one
 JBM: when is it btw?
 Astrobytes: Not announced os of yet
 JBM: fall 2021
 JBM: so probably late december
 JBM: with the CG hemispheres
 Astrobytes: I think Tibo said around halloween, but then he said it should be announced this week (iirc)
 JBM: can i try out the escape thingy on my own at a time of my choosing? (those who did)
 Astrobytes: Yeah there's an introductory one and maybe another one you can do by yourself
 Astrobytes: It's fun in a team, don't get me wrong.
 eulerscheZahl: beginning this week
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: week starts on Friday in France
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: TIL
 JBM: oh we eat frogs too
 JBM: so i heard
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: Only problem I have is replacing the bot programming contest with Escape Room, I mean they already had an Escape Room contest earlier in the year... still, it is what it is
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: "If a position with the same player to move occurs for the second time, the game is drawn"
 Astrobytes: re. LoA
 Astrobytes: also, the Abstract Games magazine link is cool
 struct: it depends on the tournament rules astro
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm going with the ones in Winands paper
 Astrobytes: These are the official rules. Some situations were not covered by the original rules. For these situations,the rules of the Mind Sports Olympiad (MSO) are used:9. If a player cannot move, this player loses.210. If a position with the same player to move occurs for the second time, the game is drawn. 
 Astrobytes: just ideas
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: Ugh I'm Bored as fuck
 struct: was bored sorry
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: My eval in FB is damn hard to balance -.-
 Illedan: 0.1 off and it is like it hates the ball
 struct: just paste it here ill fix it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: ezpz
 Illedan: You need it all?
 struct: yes
 struct: But just to eval
 struct: I dont need the entire code
 darkhorse64: I can fix it too
 struct: now I need to figure why my minimax cant find a win in depth 3
 struct: Also I cant really understand their move generator on the paper
 struct: at least for now
 BlaiseEbuth: And behold a dark horse: and his name that sat on him was 64, and Thales followed with him... :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: where's tric trac btw? Expected him to be on LoA already
 darkhorse64: should I really implement the drawing rule&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Was more just food for thought tbh
 darkhorse64: I can zobrist hash the thing
 darkhorse64: which paper struct&#160;? The winands one you quote&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: 3.1.1 Move generation 
 struct: my way is kinda slow
 struct: I can call moveGen 500k times in 100ms
 struct: still if I fix my eval my bot should be decent
 struct: I think my wincheck is fast
 struct: but i dont use Quads like the paper says
 struct: I use normal floodfill

 Illedan: SGA
 struct: no idea how that works

 TheSun00000: and I am a girl very bad in english
 ouxs: IN A GOOD A WAY
 Illedan: Stop spamming
 struct: have you tried this in any other game?
 Illedan: Yes
 Illedan: But I want to try it more
 Illedan: Just want 2nd or 1st in FB first
 Astrobytes: quads? Like quadtree kinda thing? 
 Astrobytes: I didn't read the whole paper as of now
 struct: like regions of the board
 struct: I didnt read it all just a bit
 Astrobytes: yeah, grouping it by 4 squares, quadtree
 Astrobytes: Interesting. Will read the rest of the paper later
 flipped_a_bit: how come I can't view some people's code after a clash?
 Rhitakorrr: I think people need to opt into sharing it
 flipped_a_bit: i thought the point of those was to find better ways of writing it...
 zaraptwillbebeaten: after each round they can chose to share or not
 zaraptwillbebeaten: most people do share
 zaraptwillbebeaten: you might've gotten into a lobby with a lot of bots

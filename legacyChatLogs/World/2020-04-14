 thibpat: Hello :wave: I'm streaming Ocean of Code, we've reached the gold league yesterday, time to prepare for the next one! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 aCat: hi, congratz on gold - have fun&#160;;-)
 wlesavo: 2nd PHP in legend, huh
 humair: hi
 ssda: is this  a good strategy? when someone dmg you by 1 you dmg your self by 1
 ssda: if they did not such thing expect such thing there bot will lose for sure
 metahom: ssda, may be for silver
 metahom: not for gold league
 ssda: oh I see
 ssda: I am in still in silver :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 metahom: why spend time on features you won't need  in  future? there are many usefful things you can improve
 ssda: I'm fixing my bot
 ssda: found a bug when the enemy bot shot him self
 ssda: my bot gone crazy
 metahom: yea, thats a common case
 Cappefra: I'm going crazy with my movement
 Cappefra: I want to use the 1000 ms at the beginning to explore the grid and decide a path but I don't really know how
 YannT: my eval is being a tough negociator, won't listen to reason :p
 fluxtransistor: I guess that with optimised enough code and a low level language you can really analyse the possible moves
 Uljahn: thibpat: isn't it too much for a stream during the ongoing contest?
 struct: What rank is he atm?
 wlesavo: фкщгтв 100
 wlesavo: around 100
 wlesavo: with quite primitive movement strategy actualy
 YannT: oh, siman is pushing a bit...
 YannT: W:19 / L:62  -_- 
 fluxtransistor: What is the beat algorithm for finding the minimum distance between two cells (avoiding islands)?
 fluxtransistor: *best
 kovi: i like simans current version better
 YannT: I don't like any siman versions they all kick my ass
 struct: you can use bfs fluxtransistor
 E_pur_si_muove: Hello, in Silver league the test bot issues the following command: "SILENCE N 0 |  MOVE W SILENCE |  | MSG 0 7 or 39", but the game according to the engine "Not enough charges of SILENCE"
 E_pur_si_muove: why is it not a bug? why there's no exception raised due to this invalid command?
 Illedan: Got a replay?
 E_pur_si_muove: this happens for me in every test game
 Illedan: Share a link then?
 E_pur_si_muove: Just checked the game engine source and it's not an exception case, just a simple message. 
 E_pur_si_muove: I think it's not nice.&#160;:(
 Illedan: Yeah, you have to handle it in your own bot to update your states
 Illedan: But the opponent is not getting the silence
 Illedan: only valid commands.
 E_pur_si_muove: you're right. just saw the Game summary, and not checked the inputs. sorry!&#160;:(
 RavenKZP: Guys...:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/449445297">https://www.codingame.com/replay/449445297</a>
 RavenKZP: 30 -&gt; i use SILENCE but my bot do SURFACE...
 RavenKZP: it is normal?
 Nerchio:  find a bug in your code ;P
 RavenKZP: i know the bug
 RavenKZP: it is i want to use silence when it isn't charged
 E_pur_si_muove: but there's no more command issues =&gt; no command = surface
 RavenKZP: ok so it's normal
 RavenKZP: anyway my mind was blown for it :D
 kovi: nice submit btw illedan
 bamilan: mars
 bamilan: sry accidental message
 Illedan: Thx, got pushed a lot
 aaronshenhao: Anyone know the equivalent of itertools.groupby() which groups all similar elements, not just adjacent ones?
 tobk: aaronshenhao Use a dict (manually), or just sort by the same key function first
 aaronshenhao: I see, thanks. I guess that would be simple too. Mathematica has a groupBy function too, except it groups all similar elements, not just adjacent ones.
 RMuskovets: anyone want to play with my bot?
 TheNoLifeKing: i struggled with 1D spreadsheet for far too long because of an issue i didn't fix when i copy pasted code that i was using twice. Made a loop, replaced the variable, fixed the issue. Was mad, now im relieved.
 TheNoLifeKing: RMuskovets, im interested lol
 RMuskovets: ok
 TheNoLifeKing: where am i going to do so? what does it do?
 RMuskovets: "Players" in the IDE
 RMuskovets: TheNoLifeKing but unfortunately looks like we cant play together
 TheNoLifeKing: im trying and failing to figure this out lol
 tobk: you can't play against arbitrary bots, only your same league and some below
 RMuskovets: and my own bot too&#160;:)
 tobk: yes, your own bot us usually in the same league as your own bot
 Nerchio: lel
 TheNoLifeKing: i have no idea how to even get to "players in the IDE". im not to familiar with anything but practice and clashes
 TheNoLifeKing: sorry
 RMuskovets: oh, I was talking about ocean of code
 fluxtransistor: It's the 'Ocean of Code' challenge
 TheNoLifeKing: i dont know if ill be able to test your bot, sorry. what languages do you code in?
 fluxtransistor: You have to have a competing bot to do that
 TheNoLifeKing: ah, i see. guess i can go try it out
 fluxtransistor:  It is a contest where you devise your algorithm to win a 'battle' with another bot
 fluxtransistor: You cannot see the others' code
 Nerchio: 100k characters is the limit?
 TheNoLifeKing: immediately backing out of that
 TheNoLifeKing: still an open question tho: what languages do you guys code in? i spent entirely too long trying to fix my 1D spreadsheet code and i was hoping someone would review my code.
 RMuskovets: i do python3
 TheNoLifeKing: Ah, i use c#
 RMuskovets: ik c# too :smile:
 DanTheMan832: Does silence add to your visited squares?
 E_pur_si_muove: yes. like a move, but silently
 DanTheMan832: All of the squares you pass?
 E_pur_si_muove: yes
 DanTheMan832: thanks
 TheNoLifeKing: has anyone completed 1D Spreadsheet in c# and is willing to review my code? i put way more time into it than i should have and would greatly appreciate it
 RMuskovets: What is "torpedo cooldown"?
 fluxtransistor: It is the number of recharges required before being able to torpedo.
 RMuskovets: Thanks
 dbdr: TheNoLifeKing if you have solved it you can view other people's solutions
 MiguelGomezDiaz: anybody has done  Enigma machine game?
 WINWINWIN: Can anyone reccomend a good link to learn about BFS and DFS?
 fluxtransistor: Python?
 WINWINWIN: yes python
 fluxtransistor: Look here for bfs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pythoninwonderland.wordpress.com/2017/03/18/how-to-implement-breadth-first-search-in-python/">https://pythoninwonderland.wordpress.com/2017/03/18/how-to-implement-breadth-first-search-in-python/</a>
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a>
 WINWINWIN: Thanks guys
 Cappefra: lechuck is pretty hardcore
 wlesavo: pretty hardcode
 Cappefra: ba dum tsch! :D
 idkhow2codee: I have just played clash of code and got insane problem where I was supposed to calculate area of polygon given number of vertices and their coordinates wtf
 fluxtransistor: which mode?
 idkhow2codee: fast
 fluxtransistor: ouch
 idkhow2codee: xd
 idkhow2codee: nobody did
 Cappefra: fast mode is bad for that one haha
 Cappefra: not that 15 minutes can't be enough, but the pressure...!
 Q12: if i create Reverse mode in CLASH OF CODE do I need to put something in the Statement?
 fluxtransistor: I don't think so
 aaronshenhao: Why does list(map(set, 2dGrid)) not working in my Python console (unhashable type)? I did it in a clash and it works. 
 aaronshenhao: Not only worked, but had a super strange bug, which is why I'm trying it after.
 RMuskovets: So, it should create a set from each 2dGrid. The error probably says that in 2dGrid you have an unhashable type
 RMuskovets: Like list
 aaronshenhao: Yes, it does, and I don't know what that means. I expect [set1, set2, set3] in the final result, which worked in a clash.
 RMuskovets: Sets work only with hashable types
 aaronshenhao: Could you elaborate what that means? In the clash I got something like [{'-', '.'}, {'-'}, {'.'}, {'.', '-'}]
 aaronshenhao: But in my console I get that error when I copy pasted the code
 aaronshenhao: And the weird bug I was getting was that when I did list(map(...)) twice, the list would become empty.
 tobk: what is 2dGrid? a list of lists of hashable things?
 RMuskovets: if it is a list of lists then it's items are lists and they're not hashable
 tobk: RMuskovets a list of lists would be fine, as the `set` operation is applied to each element, i.e. turing the inner lists to sets. it's the type of elements inside the inner lists that might be the problem
 aaronshenhao: 2D grid was something like [["-", "."], ["-","-"]]. Was an N*N grid.
 aaronshenhao: Ok found the issue, there is an extraneous set of []. Now to the bug
 aaronshenhao: For a = list(map(set, 2dgrid)), if I do list(a) it is fine. but if I do list(a) again it outputs an empty list.
 aaronshenhao: By extraneous set of brackets I meant it was doing list(set, [2dlist]) instead.
 tobk: then `a` is the result if `map(...)`, not of `list(map(...))`
 aaronshenhao: Yes, you are right. I did a typo. I didn't know list() modifies the map?
 aaronshenhao: Thought it just took the map, and outputted a list without doing anything to the map
 tobk: it does not modify it, but exhaust it. in Python 3, map is an iterator, i.e. it processes the elements as needed and then discards them
 aaronshenhao: Ah I see, that makes sense now. Thank you very much!
 AntiSquid: getting timeouts from my own silences :D
 AntiSquid: when i try to track them i mean
 Radewoosh: @errichto Gimmie link
 AntiSquid: oh he's doing clash :o
 dbdr: AntiSquid self spamming? :D
 struct: who is doing clashes?
 struct: errich to?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEGDNd-9PAU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEGDNd-9PAU</a> was doing struct
 struct: ah ok
 AntiSquid: dbdr 93894 paths and then i try to compute the silence :D
 struct: thanks
 AntiSquid: it's on a map without many islands
 dbdr: true, that changes the possibilities quite a lot
 Nerchio: how do you guys handle mines since 1 mine action = 4 mines?
 struct: he is getting quite big
 nicknobody: how do you do interval in python
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=interval+python">https://www.google.com/search?q=interval+python</a>
 nicknobody: thank you so much!!
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-interval-initialization-in-list/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-interval-initialization-in-list/</a>
 Q12: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4966e0dcef0ece6126f2a788ec879019633d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4966e0dcef0ece6126f2a788ec879019633d</a>
 eulerscheZahl: what makes your contribution so special that you think it needs approval?
 nicknobody: we will help you
 nicknobody: what do you need
 Nagatwin: Q12 Test2 is wrong I guess&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: sum of all numbers up to 20: 210sum of all primes up to 20: 328
 Nagatwin: haha
 eulerscheZahl: there is a C# solution provided, but it doesn't even compile
 eulerscheZahl: i thought CG checks for that?
 Q12: eulerscheZahl I hope you meant well, and actually tried to help. I think it adds to Clash of code and makes it more fun to play. I don't know if it special or not but it is my first try, I can only get better from this point
 struct: They used to check IIRC
 Q12: nicknobody Thank you! I need three approvals so my program will get to be used
 eulerscheZahl: these clash of code puzzles just look interchangeable to me. that's nothing bad for clashes, the more the better. just not my cup of tea
 Q12: Ok. than you/
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. we have 53 community contributions with a "prime" somewhere in the statement or comments
 struct: How many contributions in total?
 eulerscheZahl: 974 in my DB
 eulerscheZahl: which is a little outdated i think
 eulerscheZahl: and i plead guilty of contributing to the 53 with CGFunge Prime
 eulerscheZahl: the contest ranking feels so randomwas 2nd from the bottom when i checked this morning
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm in the middle
 AntiSquid: legend is less random than gold
 eulerscheZahl: i'm happy that i don't have to deal with gold anymore
 AntiSquid: + random boss :D
 eulerscheZahl: well known
 eulerscheZahl: blame sailsy or wlesavo
 AntiSquid: was just underlining how fun it is
 wlesavo: well it fits :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: a gold boss isn't supposed to be fun
 struct: I think the current boss fits well
 struct: 32 legend atm
 wlesavo: i meant random fits random, but yeah, really sorry that happened
 Nerchio: i have 2000 lines in gold xd
 eulerscheZahl: 1356 here
 Nerchio: it's random because there is a point in the game where you don't know if you are walking on a minefield or not
 eulerscheZahl: i think my personal highscore is 1583 lines for mean max
 tobk: just wondering: why does there has to be a boss at all? I mean, in the end you have to win most games to even be eligible to play against the boss, and even then you can lose all the boss games and still be promoted.
 struct: So short
 DanTheMan832: Any1 got any tips to avoid trapping myself in a corer and having to surface?
 tobk: in the end, you get promoted if your score is higher than some threshold, which ATM is the score of the boss, but why not just use some fixed threshold?
 eulerscheZahl: to get a stable reference tobk
 struct: My longest are CSB and FB, both unfinished
 struct: with 2k+ each
 eulerscheZahl: keep an eye on the score of top players while league size increases
 eulerscheZahl: the more players, the higher the top score. so setting a fixed score (say 30) for promotion will not keep the difficulty as constant as a boss
 tobk: hm, I guess if there were no boss, the current top player would win all the games (assuming perfect "a beats b" ordering), then would be promoted, then the second-best would win all games, and so on. okay, convinced.
 Nerchio: I wouldn't be surprised if some legend guys if dropped to the gold would have problems coming back :p
 DanTheMan832: could some1 give me some tips for avoiding trapping myself in a corner and having to surface
 ssda: finally in gold
 AntiSquid: finally a major improvement&#160;:')
 Nerchio: use alghoritms
 Nerchio: like flood fill for example
 AntiSquid: or maybe just randomness
 ssda: god I will stop done was a long week
 AntiSquid: get legend ssda
 AntiSquid: neverending fun
 ssda: AntiSquid ahh I'm a bit tired
 AntiSquid: ya me too
 AntiSquid: i kinda try hard to find motivation to change my code
 ssda: AntiSquid  fine I try to reach it I have ideas to start with
 eulerscheZahl: the contest is too long to keep up with the motication
 AntiSquid: no that's not the issue for me
 ssda: me too my code style is shit but I am learning
 AntiSquid: i think it needed the 1 month
 AntiSquid: i just never really liked it, sorry
 aCat: bleh - next time please someone kick my ass to strat coding right from the start&#160;:(
 aCat: I started after 2 weeks
 aCat: and now I have more todos than time
 AntiSquid: i will gladly do it acat, any time, for fre
 aCat:&#160;:*
 aCat: Appriciate that - I'll keep your word then
 aCat: *Appriciate
 ssda: I started last weekend
 ssda: let see what gold bot can do
 aCat: sadly quite a lot
 ssda: wow crash me
 ssda: no dmg to him
 ssda: :joy:
 ssda: does the code for the bot change when I'm in IDE?
 ssda: Gold bot I mean
 eulerscheZahl: the boss? no
 eulerscheZahl: but the boss is random
 AntiSquid: i beat it on very rare occasions
 Nerchio: antisquid tell me how to handle removing mines when enemy triggers them
 Nerchio: ideally i would like to remove more than 1 that can't be there anymore but how&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i don't do that yet
 Valdemar:  mines[y][x] = false should be enough Nerchio
 Nerchio: lel mineMap[y][x] = false is my code
 Nerchio: xD
 AntiSquid: ah i do have an array of possible positions, but i don't do any real mine handling for the opponent
 Nerchio: but i want to remove 3 other mines as well
 ssda: eulerscheZahl I mean on the IDE when you first enter gold will it change?
 ssda: and sorry for late response my windows crashed 
 Valdemar: Nerchio maybe store player positions instead of mines positions would be better
 ssda: &amp; I believe it was origin store
 eulerscheZahl: the default opponent is the boss unless you are in legend
 eulerscheZahl: and the gold boss is random
 ssda: ahh I see 
 ssda: thanks 
 Nerchio: i tried it valdemar but i don't see an easy way there
 Nerchio: since when you trigger [y][x] in theory 1 mine can be connected to more than 1
 AntiSquid: wait thibpat at 100 or so in gold, still streamin his code? wtf
 Nerchio: more than 1 position
 Valdemar: Nerchio I store mine map for every possible enemy state
 Nerchio: me too
 Nerchio: but when they put mine you need to add 4 to the map
 Valdemar: no, I add only position from which mine can be placed
 Valdemar: when trigger comes, you need to check 4 adjacent tile in each minemap
 Nerchio: ok and 2 are 'true' so what then :p
 Nerchio: you don't know which one to pick
 Valdemar: then you need to split that state to several, and remove 1 mine in each of them
 Valdemar: but i just ignore that case, it seems to be rare
 Nerchio: so 2 maps then? mine map and position of "mine" action map
 Valdemar: no, just duplicate state
 Valdemar: if you ask about mine handling by map of possible placing positions, it can be generated on the fly
 Nerchio: i am too dumb for this one maybe :P
 Nerchio: zenoscave i crashed your bot xD
 ZarthaxX: crushed*
 ZarthaxX: or crashed :thinking:
 Nerchio: crashed
 ssda: crushed*
 Nerchio: timeout
 ssda: oh right
 ZarthaxX: depends
 ssda: hhhhhhhhhhhhh
 ssda: lol
 ZarthaxX: yeah lol
 Nerchio: i am not sure what to fix anymore 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I gave up on this a week ago, I can't stay focused
 ssda: Nerchio do not worry I'm dumper than you my bot do not know anything about enemy mine
 icecream17: what? then how do you always beat me with like, 5 or 6 lives?
 ssda: whom me?
 icecream17: yeah.
 icecream17: but wait, do you move up to gold?
 ssda: yeah 
 ssda: just 10 min or somthing
 ssda: this is what I want to know some info are much less important than other
 Levvis: how to print
 ssda: I hope there will something after the competition of how should we have done it 
 ssda: Levvis depend on the Lang
 Levvis: does this website cover scratch
 ssda: i do not think so
 Levvis: how unfortunate
 ssda: you won't write long complex code with scratch
 Levvis: yes
 ssda: so why bother :joy:
 Levvis: because scratch is good
 ssda: for teaching I think 
 ssda: I have never used it 
 Levvis: think they used it for google
 ssda: where?
 Levvis: the search engine
 ssda: no way
 Levvis: yeah
 ssda: how old this lang is even
 Levvis: idk
 ssda: I just google it 
 ssda: the first prototype was in 2002 so no way
 Levvis: definitely was
 ssda: idk give any proof
 Levvis: tim berners lee
 ssda: what is this
 Levvis: the guy who made the world wide web
 ssda: how does that relate 
 ssda: and where is the proof
 Levvis: just google it
 ssda: google what
 ssda: I'm sleepy now 
 ssda: will go after sometime
 Levvis: uh ok
 ssda: sorry
 DanTheMan832: @Levvis I swear Ive seen u on YT
 Levvis: where
 DanTheMan832: @Levvis something about dreming in code
 Levvis: i just stole the kids face as a profile picture
 DanTheMan832: oh lol
 Levvis: I should probably change it
 Zenoscave: bah right below gold boss
 jules1: do i just have to wait for all the battles to complete in these competitions
 jules1: to move to the next league (potentially)
 RavenKZP: yup
 jules1: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: you are close to your first legend Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: very very close
 Zenoscave: possible bump or should i focus on resubmit?
 Nerchio: it's gold resubmit is risky xD
 eulerscheZahl: submit if notable improvement
 Zenoscave: ok
 Zenoscave: So not 1000 more submits got it
 ZarthaxX: oh first legend
 ZarthaxX: :O
 ZarthaxX: nice zeno
 Zenoscave: possibly still not sure yet
 eulerscheZahl: my promotion improvement: disable mine avoidance when moving. then i turned it back on
 eulerscheZahl: ZarthaxX you troll
 ZarthaxX: i wasnt trolling
 ZarthaxX: i meant like it would be his first one
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: jus worded it wrong
 ZarthaxX: just*
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 ZarthaxX: disable mine avoidance for promotion? the fuck lol
 Zenoscave: what do you mean disable when moving?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a danger map to avoid traps
 eulerscheZahl: so i did: dangerMap = null
 eulerscheZahl: submit, legend
 eulerscheZahl: then turned it back on, was better in legend with it
 Zenoscave: huh.
 eulerscheZahl: dont ask
 ZarthaxX: that's so wrong
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 Zenoscave: I'll do some benchmarking
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it was a lucky submit
 ZarthaxX: i would think it was
 eulerscheZahl: but 7-2 vs the boss
 eulerscheZahl: and 8-1 in legend
 eulerscheZahl: before i turned it back on
 Zenoscave: does he mine much?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and my paranoid bot surfaces too often
 Zenoscave: surface and retreat. I should add that
 eulerscheZahl: hard to find the right balance
 Zenoscave: can you move after surface?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Zenoscave: huh
 Zenoscave: the more you know
 eulerscheZahl: i think that's even disallowed in the original game
 eulerscheZahl: oh, then you don't have the killer move either i guess
 eulerscheZahl: that's your legend improvement
 Zenoscave: I do have killer but it was awful
 wlesavo: well with surface its much more effective
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/449658409">https://www.codingame.com/replay/449658409</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my bot can even combine that with mine explosions so i can be sure to win without knowing the exact location of the opponent
 Nerchio: when you submit too much the system punishes you? :D
 struct: no
 struct: maybe
 struct: Indirectly 
 metahom: no but your conscience is
 metahom: maybe the system too, dunno
 eulerscheZahl: when you submit too much, you will get captchas and when you keep spamming, you can get blocked from submitting for up to 6h
 eulerscheZahl: same for playing games in the IDE: if you play too many, there's a temporary disabling
 Zenoscave: I hit that for sure
 eulerscheZahl: submit 4 times in a row without even waiting for the results. 4th is captcha. (i had a randomized solver for an optim problem)
 tensorflw: 
 Zenoscave:  
 AntiSquid: Nerchio when you submit too much you get rewarded with a fun CG minigame
 Nerchio:  
 aaronshenhao:  
 AntiSquid: gg zeno :p
 Zenoscave: I lose random low games
 AntiSquid: ya, see my bot msg if you need to debug
 wlesavo: is it still printing muda muda? :grinning:
 Zenoscave: yes -_-
 AntiSquid: and top 100 is the new low eh?
 Zenoscave: it is
 RavenKZP: AntiSquid my MSGs are better for debug :P
 AntiSquid: nice :D
 AntiSquid: now you're ready for gold RavenKZP
 RavenKZP: on my way
 RavenKZP: i need to create some bugs because before removing them i was on silver 44 and after fix i go to 136 :D
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: bugs are only good until you need to improve
 AntiSquid: i rewrote my bot
 RavenKZP: i guess they add some chaos to behavior and make it less predictable 
 AntiSquid: need to watch stream for heuristics now, thib pat got to mid of gold 
 AntiSquid: they only get you so far RavenKZP, precision is still needed&#160;:/
 leegamer42: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1186253f4fe454cfb5af0331a3316441ea2d5a0">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1186253f4fe454cfb5af0331a3316441ea2d5a0</a>
 AntiSquid: leegamer42 please don't post the clash invite links in chat
 leegamer42: ok
 AntiSquid: if players enjoy clash they will come and play it
 leegamer42: but it says that i should share the url on the right panel
 leegamer42: the website itself says it
 leegamer42:&#160;??
 AntiSquid: if everyone keeps doing that chat gets flooded with clash links
 Zenoscave: it means share it in private chats
 leegamer42: so make correction in the website
 leegamer42: oh okay
 leegamer42: must have read it wrong
 Zenoscave: not in public. never said anything about where to share
 leegamer42: ya it is missleading in a way
 Zenoscave: not really, you just made an assumption
 leegamer42: it says to share with frnds, now one person can mentally think of this as a friendly place
 leegamer42: or you guys as friend
 AntiSquid: chill mate
 AntiSquid: you get plenty people that play clash
 Zenoscave: there are thousands of users on this site if everyone shared their clashes it would get crowded in chat is all
 leegamer42: ya i get that
 AntiSquid: many don't like clash btw
 leegamer42: it is fun
 leegamer42: but yea its easy
 eulerscheZahl: then use the invite feature
 AntiSquid: well someone better make a bot that spams clash chats with contest invites
 AntiSquid: because it's more fun than clash 
 Enknable: Automaton2000 likes clash, right?
 Automaton2000: i can give you some pointers
 Zenoscave: pointer 1. don't invite people to clash
 Enknable: Automaton2000 loves pointers too!
 Automaton2000: it was just a bug
 Zenoscave: what was Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's just a list of moves
 fluxtransistor: pointer * pointer2
 Enknable: what about AutomatonNN? You like pointers?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is the most important part of the code for the same testcase
 Zenoscave: typedef struct { struct * struct} Struct;
 struct:&#160;:(
 Enknable: lol
 Ramdeath: Any difference fire torpedo | move or move | fire torpedo?
 Zenoscave: slight change in possible paths ramdeath
 Zenoscave: also range of attack
 Ramdeath: so i can first move then torpedo?
 Zenoscave: yes
 fluxtransistor: Is there a way to find out the response time of your code in the IDE?
 Ramdeath: tnx Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: using a clock in the code and printing error messages fluxtransistor
 Zenoscave: yw
 fluxtransistor: thanks
 Ramdeath: Zenoscave one question: SILENCE always last command?
 struct: any order
 aaronshenhao: If python can use timeit too
 Zenoscave: you can do any order but it is usually best to silence early I think
 idkhow2codee: why?
 Zenoscave: masks moves better I think
 idkhow2codee: nvm
 Zenoscave: Early in the game i mean.
 Zenoscave: I silence last at end of turn
 Zenoscave: might have been confusing there
 RavenKZP: wait so i can use MOVE and then SILENCE in same command?
 Zenoscave: yes
 RavenKZP: :fearful:
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Ramdeath: "MOVE E MINE | SILENCE N 0 | TORPEDO 3 3 | TRIGGER 2 2 | SONAR 5 | MSG text"
 Ramdeath: like this
 Zenoscave: yup
 RavenKZP: ctrl+a -&gt; del -&gt; submit
 Ramdeath: :D
 RavenKZP: all i have to say
 RavenKZP: man i was live in a lie
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave legend today?
 AntiSquid: ctrl+z RavenKZP
 Zenoscave: maybe ZarthaxX
 Zenoscave: if i'm verrrry lucky
 ZarthaxX: u deserve this one
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: also you are tryharding with many days left
 ZarthaxX: i believe un u
 fluxtransistor: So I'm timing my program in python and if I start the timer the line before the first input() call and end it just before the last one, it gives me about 4 - 8 ms
 Zenoscave: thanks
 fluxtransistor: But if I start the timer the line before the first input(), it is somewhere between 2000-4000 ms?!
 aaronshenhao: That's because you have to wait for the input() :P
 fluxtransistor: * first text should be after the input call
 fluxtransistor: Yes, but does it count towards my time
 fluxtransistor:&#160;?
 aaronshenhao: Yea, you're just taking the time on the clock
 Zenoscave: you can't get exact. 
 fluxtransistor: I'm using perf_counter(), giving ms accuracy
 payroll-beats: Did anybody here solve the ASCII art 
 aaronshenhao: Which one
 fluxtransistor: and 4 or 4000 ms is a difference
 Zenoscave: but the time start can't be exact
 aaronshenhao: input() is for user input?
 fluxtransistor: It is for input by the referee
 fluxtransistor: This specific one only gives my_id, width and height
 fluxtransistor: So no waiting for the enemy bot
 fluxtransistor: Any ideas?
 aaronshenhao: Why do I keep getting a gazillion capchas
 aaronshenhao: captcha*
 DanTheMan832: How can you handle silence in relation to tracking the enemy?
 AntiSquid: wrecking boss more often :o
 Nerchio: top60 gold is a nightmar
 AntiSquid: can't be that bad imo, i still have lots of room for improvement
 SecondStriker: Can any one please tell me how to change difficulty for clash of code private clash?
 AntiSquid: actually i agree with you nerchio, these guys are putting up too much resistance and make it annoying to reach legend @_@
 WhiteGlove: is anyone currently doing the morse puzzle?
 AntiSquid: chuck norris or bruce lee?
 WhiteGlove: The Resistance
 tobk: aw, come on, is there any bot that is NOT random? getting a timeout in some games, tried 5 different opponents, send to IDE, no problem.
 WhiteGlove: chuck norris I still have it to complete
 wlesavo: Go in legendo, nice
 mlomb: tobk I feel you
 eulerscheZahl: tobk most bots in legend are deterministic
 eulerscheZahl: join us&#160;:)
 tobk: I'm trying, but that's not easy with all those random non-reproducible bots in Gold ...&#160;:-P
 idkhow2codee: guys how to get any debug output from my bot?
 tobk: what, how to print it or how to see it? if the latter, when in the IDE or in a replay?
 jacek: print to stderr
 idkhow2codee: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65d2c96d-4801-4455-aef3-d2f855e7120b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65d2c96d-4801-4455-aef3-d2f855e7120b</a>
 idkhow2codee: It doesn't print
 idkhow2codee: row doesn't print*
 idkhow2codee: is it because of for loop or smth?
 jacek: it should be printed
 jacek: unless loop isnt inovked at all
 Zenoscave: are you showing debug messages?
 Zenoscave: theres a little drop down that has check boxes that can disable it
 idkhow2codee: yes
 idkhow2codee: if I try outside of for loop scope then it prints lol
 Zenoscave: what is MAP_HEIGHT set to?
 idkhow2codee: 15
 ZarthaxX: 3 quadrillions
 Zenoscave: interesting
 idkhow2codee: xd
 idkhow2codee: k I'll try to fix it on my own thanks anyway
 AntiSquid: so close yeshhh, soon to wreck the boss @_@
 DEIZ21: WhiteGlove  i did it
 wlesavo: AntiSquid what he even did to you, pls dont rekt him
 AntiSquid: blocking my way
 AntiSquid: at the very least hope to be above kh ao and the rest of the TS guys
 WhiteGlove: @DEIZ21 nice!
 WhiteGlove: I'm trying another approach
 WhiteGlove: I will convert first the dictionary and then check if its the same as the morse code given
 Fangel: et dieu inventa le sonar&#160;!
 AntiSquid: et Dieu a vu que c'était mauvais @Fangel
 kovi: grat fangel
 Fangel: thx kovi
 AntiSquid: did you really reach legend thanks to sonar?
 Zenoscave: Turns out I was doing sonar from opponents off by one move and removing my actual position from the opponent view of my possible paths
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 Zenoscave: oops
 fluxtransistor: If I instantly get -1 hp after giving valid starting coordinates, is it a timeout?
 fluxtransistor: also congratulations for legend
 DEIZ21: sure
 Chewie2k: What Maths does bank robbers use?
 DEIZ21: so either your program take too much time or your program crashed
 fluxtransistor: there is no stderr output
 DEIZ21: investigate
 fluxtransistor: I'm trying to... if I try print a line in the main loop just before opponent_orders = input().split() it works
 fluxtransistor: but after that it doesn't
 DEIZ21: check your inputstream, i would say your program is waiting for an input forever
 DEIZ21: got it?
 fluxtransistor: The input is given by the 'referee'
 fluxtransistor: And I have not changed the input lines&#160;;(
 DEIZ21: the only thing i see in the instruction  = input().split() i is that input() is waiting for data
 DEIZ21: so go check how u initialized the input reader
 DEIZ21: donct panic
 DEIZ21: just give the time it deserve you ll find it
 DEIZ21:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: gg Anti ;P
 Nerchio: zenos legend?
 Zenoscave: No. but close
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 Illedan: What rank is the boss now?
 Zenoscave: 28.28
 Zenoscave: I do decent-ish against all but dolmen
 ZarthaxX: he will leave soon
 Zenoscave: 10% wins against him
 Zenoscave: might bump him
 ZarthaxX: so close D:
 Zenoscave: nvm lost to boss last match
 Nerchio: i feel like floodfill movement strategy is not very good
 muy31: this question might be really late to ask, but why would I place a mine one way over another?
 Nerchio: need to take control of certain areas of the map and use them
 Nerchio: will have to rewrite movement tomorrow :p
 Zenoscave: Should Resumbit? I have 60% wR against top 20 and dolmen promoted
 Zenoscave: resubmit.
 ZarthaxX: doit
 Zenoscave: 40 Wins 30 losses against top 20. perhaps worth it
 icecream17: i'm gonna delete this whole function - probably a bad idea
 dolmen1234: hey thanks Zenoscave&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: yw&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: idk which game zeno, i submit spam, trying to find best version and trying to cure these bloody bugs
 AntiSquid: referring to your gg
 Zenoscave: It was a while ago
 Zenoscave: I don't have a replay
 AntiSquid: i have some stupid bug where the bot just surfaces for no reason&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: strange
 wlesavo: nice dolmen
 Illedan: Daym, legend getting crowded
 Nerchio: good submit brings me to ~35spot in gold xd lol
 Nerchio: and i didnt change anything before i was ~80
 RavenKZP: random algorithms :D
 kovi: yeah, clibming became slower
 struct: Many bots on same skill level?
 Illedan: Mostly reactive bots, making it feel random
 kovi: what is a reactive bot?
 Illedan: Only reacting to the current state
 Illedan: Not thinking ahead
 Astrobytes: reflex agent, reacts to current environment only]#
 Astrobytes: -]#
 AntiSquid: q-learning algo results into a reflex bot - AutomatonNN change my mind
 AutomatonNN: aggressive is the reason why i can't see them
 Zenoscave: SARSA stands for what?
 Astrobytes: Silly assholes request silly answers :P :D
 AntiSquid: a virus? /s
 Zenoscave: state action reward state action
 Zenoscave: q-learning is two states not one
 Zenoscave: nice silly answer Astrobytes?
 Zenoscave: *&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: all a bunch of lice
 Astrobytes: :D

 icecream17: Zenoscave, AntiSquid, Astrobytes, all compound usernames
 Zenoscave: Icecream17 is too
 Astrobytes: beat me to it
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 icecream17: does it really count though?
 Astrobytes: ...
 Zenoscave: is ice and cream two separate ideas?
 icecream17: I don't know....
 icecream17: didn't really think much about my username until now.
 icecream17: but wait, a computer might split it into "icec" and "ream"
 Zenoscave: same with ant  and isquid
 Zenoscave: doesn't make yours not the same
 Nerchio: when this even started?
 icecream17: i see (your example though...)
 Astrobytes: Right, time to watch a movie and chill. Gn everyone
 Zenoscave: gn
 Zenoscave: gl hfg

 icecream17: wow

 AntiSquid: i am lost, what changes did i even make, which ones were the best, what is the meaning of life Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i don't know why
 Cappefra: how can I make my ocean of code bot play against a specific player?
 struct: If he is in same league or below yes
 Cappefra: yeah but how?
 struct: press settings on left
 struct: and enable expert settings
 Cappefra: oh cool, thanks!
 Nerchio: what do you guys use for movement?
 Cappefra: feet
 Nerchio: in ocean of code xd
 Cappefra: dehihiho
 Cappefra: I don't think there's a name for whatever I do
 Nerchio: i feel like i need to change my movement to move further i usually die when i walk into a bad spot
 Cappefra: I spawn in the largest rectangle and I move towards the most unvisited area
 Cappefra: I recognize only the easiest deadlocks, meaning if they're straight in my direction and monodirectional
 Cappefra: I want to change it to avoid enemy minefields... haven't really thought of how tho
 Nerchio: i feel like going into the corner of the map so around let's say 2 square from the edge
 Nerchio: is giving away map control
 icecream17: Map control? I haven't even thought about that....
 Cappefra: yeah at first I was moving only one direction until I couldn't, then I would perform a u-turn and keep going like that, but I noticed I gave away my position way too early on
 Nerchio: I thought about it too late, after my 2000 line code became a giant mess
 Nerchio: i actually have trouble with bots like this Cappefra ;p
 Nerchio: if you move like that and use silence often enough its not so easy
 Nerchio: i feel like my bot sometimes gives away his position much faster in certain patterns
 Cappefra: Well what I do now is pretty much the same but my "one-way" movement is restricted to a randint
 Cappefra: so it looks kinda the same as before but it keeps me a bit more hidden
 Nerchio: imagine this 
 Nerchio: a bot that starts from 0,0 and goes to 14,14 covering every square in between
 Nerchio: and places mine and silence 
 Nerchio: IF you let him get to the end
 ZarthaxX: that may be impossible tho
 Nerchio: then you're in big trouble since the whole map is mines
 Nerchio: i kno
 icecream17: =O I have an idea! A whole ROW of mines
 Nerchio: 0,0 and 14,14 is is just an example
 Nerchio: obviously you need to make it work for different maps
 Cappefra: how do you track enemy mines btw?
 struct: I think the biggest thing is to stay the loingest undetected possible
 struct: I have seen anyone doing a row of mines
 Nerchio: another possibility is like someone said
 Nerchio: you start from the middle you make a row of mines and you just keep on 1 side of the map
 Nerchio: you calculate which one is bigger
 Cappefra: yeah I feel like that's probably the most effective way
 Nerchio: so he comes to you and he dies
 Cappefra: I think most top 10 do pretty much exactly that
 Cappefra: from what I've seen
 Nerchio: my random bot dies in stupid ways too much
 Nerchio: not consistent enough for legend
 Cappefra: you're high gold though
 Nerchio: i was top 30 and top120 with the same code pretty much
 Cappefra: I watch my games and I don't really know what to improve to get from my position to yours
 Nerchio: I ironed out all the edge cases so it's more consistent but probably will rewrite movement 
 Cappefra: which is 260 ranks 
 Nerchio: well some kind of mine tracking is useful in gold i think
 Cappefra: do you win against lechuck?
 Nerchio: sometimes yeah
 Cappefra: yeah mine tracking is on my todo for sure
 Cappefra: I think I would enjoy this more if there was no silence
 Cappefra: I hate silence hahaha
 blasterpoard: Cappefra you get totally destroyed by mines, even if I use almost no silences www.codingame.com/replay/449899445
 Cappefra: yeah I'm not tracking them at all atm, it wasn't necessary for silver and I just made gold today
 Nerchio: i wonder why many people in legend use silence 4
 blasterpoard: Nerchio because when you torpedo, you want to maximize the average damage - that means, you hit distances 0-3
 Nerchio: makes sense didn't think about that
 Nerchio: last square has only 2
 Nerchio: maybe it's time i brought back my silence code
 Nerchio: i commented it out and made silence N 0 every time :D
 Nerchio: i will see how my bot does with silence 4 every time 
 mviudes: hi every one
 struct: hi
 Nerchio: capperfra i beat you with silence 4 ;D
 Cappefra: hahaha
 Cappefra: that's cause my bot is particularly strong against always-0 players
 Cappefra: I have a separate tracking that hypothesizes tje opponent does that and ignores silence 
 Nerchio: omg
 Nerchio: i don't like people who shoot silence n 0 :D
 Cappefra: I can't tell you how strong that was in silver
 Cappefra: even the captain did that
 Nerchio: I lost so many matches where i shoot and silence and the guy just responds with direct shot for silence n0
 Nerchio: like really
 Nerchio: i could be in many other spots :D
 blasterpoard: but shooting there hits most squares ^^
 Cappefra: right? I'm especially pissed when it happens after I silence 4
 Cappefra: blaster do you backtrace the enemy's visited positions?
 blasterpoard: Cappefra what do you mena by that?
 blasterpoard: *mean
 Nerchio: see you tomorrow guys
 Cappefra: like when you have its position you can trace its past moves since its last surface and you know exactly where it's been
 blasterpoard: of course
 blasterpoard: how would I track mines otherwise?
 Cappefra: and then for every mine action you have 4 possible mines?
 blasterpoard: no
 blasterpoard: it works a bit diffferently, but you're on the right track
 Cappefra: yeah I'll have to think about it a bit tomorrow
 Cappefra: thanks!
 blasterpoard: making it work without timing out is a bit tricky
 blasterpoard: &lt;1 ms now, though
 Cappefra: cool!
 AntiSquid: rank frozen on ladder&#160;:/
 daffie: we're still having the annual code contest in a few days right?
 daffie: derp it is april nvm
 AntiSquid: annual&#160;?
 icecream17: what will the spring challenge be like?
 AntiSquid: you'd have to ask the creators
 icecream17: oh... i mean, is it like a regular contest?
 AntiSquid: apparently 
 AntiSquid: how are you icecream17&#160;?
 icecream17: ok. have some at home learning to do. also i'm restarting a whole function

 AntiSquid: don't post clash links here
 AntiSquid: please
 Famout: o_o wut.. this pathfinding bot I made in wood 2 is now advanced to silver...
 Famout: I haven't had time to update it, and I just keep advancing....
 Famout: ...It isn't even a good pathfinding bot either, sub-optimal... but good enough apparently? 
 Famout: I guess what I am saying is if you wanna feel good about your code, make a simple bot for the OoC!
 RavenKZP: sometimes good pathfinding is best way to win&#160;:)
 icecream17: What? 10851 possible squares?
 MostComplicatedUsername: DIVIDING BY 0
 MostComplicatedUsername: Aha!
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im a genius
 icecream17: In regular math 0 / 0 - undefined... but in the coding world it's NaN
 Famout: Is there any place to see what changes in the leagues besides what they highlight? 
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well
 MostComplicatedUsername: 0/0 = all numbers
 MostComplicatedUsername: Anything else/0 = infinity
 icecream17: Is 0/0 positive? lol
 Famout: And negative too... 
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave
 ZarthaxX: did u resubmit

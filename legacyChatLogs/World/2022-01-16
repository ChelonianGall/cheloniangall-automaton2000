 Tiberiusen: anyone know any optimazing tricks for recursive dfs in 2d array, i already have a visited variable
 Tiberiusen: def dfs(visited, maze, pos_row,pos_col,len_maze): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/30dac079-590a-4531-96c6-35b33b6a7acf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/30dac079-590a-4531-96c6-35b33b6a7acf</a>
 struct: which puzzle are you doing?
 Tiberiusen: its not from codingame, its a maze traversal problem though
 struct: usually i do it like that
 struct: but i dont use recursion
 struct: i only really use the visited
 struct: is your visited a dictionary?
 Tiberiusen: its a set(). it can solve mazes up to 49*49 size.
 Tiberiusen: maybe recursion is to slow to solve big mazes
 Quidome: maybe python is to slow&#160;:)
 Uljahn: could be faster in numpy
 jacek: or C

 SMOKEz8z8: could I get some feedback on what topic to learn about
 SMOKEz8z8: seems it can be done much easier, but the solutions provided are to complex to comprehend for me
 Astrobytes: struct: 12th I think
 Astrobytes: has some kind of similarity with A*Craft but not quite
 BlaiseEbuth: Astroback o/
 Astrobytes: yo dude, btw I have no idea what happened to franknzappa channel, lots down recently due to copyright strikes&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah...&#160;:(
 5DN1L: SMOKEz8z8 You can use "ord" to get the ASCII value of a character and then to calculate the index of the ascii art you need to convert the character to
 SMOKEz8z8: looked up ord, my self, but what I found was, P has a value 80, how would I use that for an index?
 5DN1L: subtract a constant
 5DN1L: for "?", make use of another constant
 YS_Yousef: can any one help
 Astrobytes: only if you ask a relevant question.
 YS_Yousef: with?
 BlaiseEbuth: Is that a relevant question&#160;?
 Astrobytes: with.
 BlaiseEbuth: Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiizzzzzz
 SMOKEz8z8: thx for the tip, now I dont have to create an alphabet list myself to find the index. But  I am gettings errors because of the spaces in the last test. Back to google it is&#160;:)

 Blabbage: I want to recommend Wontonimo's Wave Function Collapse - Classic Puzzle HARD. It has two days left and only needs one more approval. I had a lot of fun with it and really think that it deserves approval:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75474b51e6b3186ea493a8467395fbbefad7">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75474b51e6b3186ea493a8467395fbbefad7</a>
 Nachosauce: I'm much too dumb for that one :grimacing:
 jacek: shall i approve it without testing? :thinking:
 Nachosauce: It's Wontonimo so probably nothing would go wrong lol
 Uljahn: "The River I" is kinda straightforward, you sum digits for the smallest river and make it progress one step ahead untill both rivers meet
 Blabbage: jacek: wouldn't do that, I think at least 3 people should be able to solve it from it's current description, otherwise it might be too unclear to others
 Blabbage: I do understand that approving a hard puzzle is a lot of work, and I honestly used a lot of time on reading about the Wave Function Collapse and fighting my own bugs to make it work. I just think it was a nice journey with a cool end result
 Blabbage: Gotta go now, take care everyone
 xlr4829: users.match('me').delete()
 jacek: Blabbage i could copy paste the solution and call it a day :V
 Alaory: yooooo
 jacek: :upside_down:
 SMOKEz8z8: look at the mad pod racing challenge, is there away to store a value to the next iteration? so I could compare next_checkpoint_angle between two frames?
 jacek: yes&#160;:?
 jacek: you can init variables before the loop
 SMOKEz8z8: hmm, does the part before the loop get executed with each pass?
 SMOKEz8z8: next_checkpoint_angle is only defined when the loop starts
 jacek: compare next_checkpoint_angle with t, do something
 jacek: then t = next_checkpoint_angle
 jacek: n next loop iteration youll get t = angle of previous iteration
 Smelty: yes.
 jacek: eeyup*

 Wontonimo: in these lines
 Wontonimo:   vector&lt;PLAYER&gt; players;
 Wontonimo: I think you need to assign them to something
 Maxim251: normally It should be like this ...players-&gt;push.back( new PLAYER( i ) );But I see that another way is working alsoplayers.push.back( PLAYER( i ));
 struct: if you already know the number of players you can do
 struct: vector&lt;Player&gt; players(n);
 struct: but push_back is fine I think
 Maxim251: No I don't know. Thats why, I am adding players on the fly, In game there can be up to 4 players
 Wontonimo: or just use a primitive list for faster operations
 struct: -&gt; new Player() would be used if it was
 struct: vector&lt;Player*&gt; players;
 Maxim251: And my question is if that line " players.push.back( PLAYER( i )); " is no causing any memory leaks
 Wontonimo: holy cow, my wave function collapse puzzle just got approved!  I didn't think it would happen considering how non-traditional it is.  I do really like the algo for this though
 Maxim251: Yes Struct, normally I should use pointers and create players with "new" comand
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yes, we will monitor #fr for any reactions
 Wontonimo: thank you calebharrison , Husoski, LazyMammal, and Blabbage
 Maxim251: Congratulations Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: :D thanks Maxim251
 jacek: well Blabbage advertised it
 struct: I dont think any leak will happen on that code Maxim251
 Maxim251: then, I can use this way&#160;? players.push.back( PLAYER( i ));Because when I was learning C++ I never see this line in use from anybody.
 Maxim251: Thats why i am suprising that it works.
 jacek: whats wrong with it
 jacek: besides PLAYER being all caps

 Maxim251: Trying to add position to a vector, using class constructor.Normally always I need do PLAYER player;Assighn some values, and then push that player to vector.

 SheLuvCoding: which one
 SheLuvCoding: puzzle or pikachu
 struct: they are both puzzles

 Blokops: they are for more experience users
 Blokops: oh he made detective picakchu i stadnc orrected
 struct: :D
 SheLuvCoding: idek how to do this descent thing
 SheLuvCoding: do i just attack mountains
 struct: press hints on the left
 struct: every new turn you are given the height of all the current mountains
 struct: in the for loop
 struct: you need to print the index of the highest one
 SheLuvCoding: it is while loop
 SheLuvCoding: oh ok
 struct: you can ignore the while loop
 struct: is just so the game loops forever
 CoonCoder: it muh be niceeeee
 SheLuvCoding: ok i printed 7 because thats the highest range it can go
 CoonCoder: i m trynna get likee struct
 SheLuvCoding: but it didnt work
 struct: thats the height
 struct: you need to print the index
 SheLuvCoding: ohh
 SheLuvCoding: its 6
 CoonCoder: use .index function :D
 SheLuvCoding: it didnt work
 SheLuvCoding: it says for i in range(8)
 SheLuvCoding: so wouldnt it be likke 1 less
 Blokops: if its a list you can use list.index(value) to give you the index of where the value is found
 SheLuvCoding: or something
 SheLuvCoding: is there no run button
 SheLuvCoding: is it only the testcase thing
 jacek: there are always 8 mountains, destroyed mountain has 0 height
 jacek: there is play testcase, play all testcases and submit

 SheLuvCoding: i got 0%
 SheLuvCoding: i made a list woith number 1-7
 SheLuvCoding: and printed that
 SheLuvCoding: but oit didnt pwrk
 SheLuvCoding: work
 Blokops: first try to pass all the test cases
 SheLuvCoding: how do i do it 
 SheLuvCoding: do i just print all the indexes
 Blokops: okey so what you need to do is each loop print the mountain with the biggest value
 Blokops: but then the tallest mountian will change
 Blokops: thats why 1 to 7 does work
 Blokops: M(ountian) 1 can be the tallest more times in  a row 
 SheLuvCoding: mannnn this is too hard
 SheLuvCoding: is there an easier one
 SheLuvCoding: or can i looka t someones code

 C26_1: what
 Blokops: what
 C26_1: a is a float number, sr because I didn't mention that
 Blokops: oh
 C26_1: for example:
 C26_1: input 3.5 will output 2
 C26_1: because 2 is the smallest number
 C26_1: and 3.5*2 = 7 (7 is an integer of course)
 Blokops: the easy answer would just be a while loop
 snoyes: 3.5*0 is also an integer, and 0 &lt; 2.
 C26_1: pretty trivial for all numbrs
 C26_1: Have you ever heard of Lexicography Order Computation?
 C26_1: Given a number <a href="/index.php?title=N&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="N (page does not exist)">N</a> in decimal, print all the numbers that satified all conditions below:- Each numbers have the number of digit '1' the same as the <a href="/index.php?title=N&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="N (page does not exist)">N</a> when converted to binary- The length of each numbers must smaller or equal to the length of <a href="/index.php?title=N&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="N (page does not exist)">N</a> in binary
 C26_1: There is one thing I need to clarify
 C26_1: The length of a number in binary
 C26_1: 0010 = 2
 C26_1: AND
 C26_1: 00000010 = 2
 C26_1: You're just ignored all the trailings of 0
 C26_1: so 2 in binary (10) has a length of 2
 C26_1: @all, can I ask a question
 C26_1: Can I make a lot of var to keep track of some info
 C26_1: to make debugging easier for me

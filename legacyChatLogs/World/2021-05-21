 AntiSquid: CortexDeveloper <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://nnfs.io/">https://nnfs.io/</a> i recommended it to many people, including users here on CG and I've seen only positive responses so far
 CortexDeveloper: :thumbsup:
 yassine_Benlahbib: hello
 jacek: so youre reinforced on positive values only
 Alina24: hi
 MSmits: AntiSquid I am reading that nnfs book
 Wontonimo: how is it?  I have watched a few of the authors videos back in the day before he wrote the book
 MSmits: it's too bad the video series only goes to 25% of it. I actually thought it was better than the book. Normally I prefer written stuff
 MSmits: but the book is fine
 MSmits: I'm at around page 200
 MSmits: I know all of the math so every time it's about math, I speed through ot
 jacek: any plot twists?
 MSmits: it
 MSmits: it's just basic NN stuff. Pretty in depth. doesn't get into convolution and such, but I does  explain everything up to and including backpropagation
 MSmits: explains many activation functions too
 MSmits: and, as opposed to other sources, explains every step of the math in detail
 MSmits: goes into saving and loading of models and such at the end
 MSmits: and it's not written with tensorflow or other tools in mind. Just basic python
 MSmits: well, numpy of course
 MSmits: but it even explains the workings of numpy
 KalamariKing: nnfs yes?
 MSmits: oh and there's lots of code. You can reproduce everything they do
 MSmits: yes
 KalamariKing: great resource
 Wontonimo: nice.  seems like a  really  really long book for just fully connected linear NN
 KalamariKing: Yeah kinda
 MSmits: it's long because of detail
 MSmits: if you go through it, you don't just know how to do things. You know how it works and why it works
 MSmits: and it's not long at all if you have prior knowledge. I am a third of the way through in about a day
 MSmits: the information contained in here, is enough for a university class
 MSmits: which would take 8 weeks or something
 MSmits: but gj AntiSquid for sharing. Darkhorse told me about it, but I guess you told him?
 KalamariKing: It goes pretty far in-depth, not sure about other types of nns tho
 Wontonimo: On the topic of NN (and AI in general), This  MIT OpenWare course is really good survey of AI <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXt8qF2Zzfo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXt8qF2Zzfo</a>
 Wontonimo: the link  is to the NN video
 MSmits: yeah i guess it covers similar stuff, but the nnfs has way more detail than a single video can
 MSmits: (unless it's 10 hrs)
 MSmits: another major advantage of this book is that because it contains actual code, it really invites you to try stuff
 MSmits: I think a lot of people watch the video's and such but never actually start experimenting
 Wontonimo: what?  how do you learn then?
 MSmits: you dont learn how to do it, you learn about it. I think many people just learn about it
 MSmits: like i have for the past year o rso
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: A lot of people I know who supposedly know nn stuff just know theory
 KalamariKing: kinda sad
 MSmits: as long as enough know the practice, it's fine
 MSmits: I wish more people who didn't do science, knew about science
 MSmits: then we might not have people lighting 5G towers on fire
 MSmits: they dont have to ever go into a lab to prevent that you know
 MSmits: they just have to know the theory
 jacek: i know nn by practice, little on theory. am i bad
 jacek: it works and i dont know why
 MSmits: you know a lot of theory
 MSmits: you just dont realize :P
 MSmits: it's imposter syndrome
 MSmits: what do you not know?
 MSmits: I mean, you say you dont know why stuff works, why not?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/1954/">https://xkcd.com/1954/</a>
 jacek: i was a little sarcastic
 MSmits: lol you have a meme or link  for everything&#160;:)
 jacek: i just didnt dive into math too deep
 jacek: there is xkcd for everything
 MSmits: well I'm sure you know what a partial derivative is, or&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: then you're fine
 MSmits: backpropagation is the most complicated part and thats just a whole bunch of partial derivatives
 MSmits: i dont think you need to go through the math more than 1 time. Consider why some things work and some things dont. Then abstract it and dont look at it again unless you have to
 MSmits: it's helpful to know why you would use a softmax for the last activation function
 MSmits: that sort of thing, but i guess you know that too
 Wontonimo: like all of programming, solve the thing,  make it into a function, then use it at a high level and move on
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: oh i had a question jacek
 MSmits: maybe you know this
 MSmits: when you take the input of a typical board game, which has cells that generally have p1, p2 marks or are empty
 MSmits: is it useful to use as input -1 for p2, 0 for empty and 1 for p1
 MSmits: or do you have 2 inputs per cell that are 0 or 1, 1 for each player
 MSmits: the first version is way more compact, but i suspect there are disadvantages to it
 Wontonimo: i don't  know  about optimizing for CG, but in image processing you want separate  layers  
 MSmits: layers of what?
 jacek: for me each state is separate input
 KalamariKing: Wontonimo is talking nns
 Wontonimo: 2  inputs
 jacek: 0 activates different input, X activates different input and O activates different input
 KalamariKing: If you're doing a nn, I would one-hot the inputs
 jacek: ^
 MSmits: but doesnt that mean 3 inputs?
 KalamariKing: Or two-hot or whatever, just not smth like -1 for a, 0 for b, 1 for c, etc
 KalamariKing: Why does the number of inputs matter?
 jacek: well yeah, for TT that would be 3 inputs x 9 so 27 inputs in which there are always 9 activated
 MSmits: ok so thats what you do, that's actual one-hot indeed
 MSmits: i am just wondering *why* the -1,0,1 version wouldnt work
 MSmits: or maybe if it works, but far less efficiently
 KalamariKing: The nn nodes are linked together such that a -1 might give the opposite result than a 1, if that makes sense
 MSmits: sure
 KalamariKing: If its one-hot then they can give similar but different results
 MSmits: but is that a bad thing for a board game?
 MSmits: an opposite result?
 Wontonimo: I need to do a multi with NNs before I say anymore.  This format of super tight compute time, small(ish) memory constraints, and no libraries is out of my comfort zone.  Perhaps the -1/0/1 is better for CG constraints.
 KalamariKing: That is also something to keep track of
 KalamariKing: But couldn't you cut time somewhere else? 100ms is a lot of time to a computer
 MSmits: I was thinking about oware. If you input the number of seeds, you can have like 60 different possible values for the input. That's way more even. If you have only 3 for a cell, why would that be an issue if 60 in oware isnt
 MSmits: the seeds in oware are also discrete possibillities
 jacek: that -1/0/1 thing maybe would work if you flip the board for the current player
 Wontonimo: okay MSmits, consider the case where the NN would like to calculate the XOR between two adjacent cells and check if only one is empty.
 MSmits: i'm thinking
 MSmits: why would this be a problem?
 jacek: fyi i have 820 inputs for oware
 Wontonimo: i'm thinking also...
 MSmits: brb, keep talking:)
 KalamariKing: Was that like a rhetorical question or an actual question
 Wontonimo: sorry, should have stated that it's  what i'm starting to  think about as  a mental test
 Wontonimo: i don't have the answer yet
 jacek: what was the question o.O
 Wontonimo: given 2 cells in a board, 
 Wontonimo: and it can be owned by p1, p2 or unoccupied
 KalamariKing: if the nn wanted to xor two adjacent cells, to check if only one is empty
 Wontonimo: yes.  using either -1/0/1 for encoding or 1 hot
 KalamariKing: would one-hot x3 inputs be better or a single [ -1/0/1 ]
 Wontonimo: 1 hot being [0,0,1] [0,1,0] [1,0,0]
 KalamariKing: yeah, where only... one is... hot
 jacek: why 3 brackets?
 KalamariKing: Three test input cases
 Wontonimo: two -1/0/1 (one for  each cell) or two [x,x,x], one for each cell
 jacek: 2 vs 6 inputs
 Wontonimo: right
 KalamariKing: One-hot simply means instead of giving the nn one input ranging from x to y, you give it (y-x) inputs and only have one on
 KalamariKing: if that makes sense at all
 jacek: well both would work i think
 jacek: when you have bias input anyway
 Wontonimo: float x[2] vs float x[2][3]
 MSmits: jacek holy sht so many inputs for oware
 jacek: as long as it works...
 MSmits: yeah, it just seems a lot
 MSmits: this is basically one-hot for seeds then?
 MSmits: + score
 jacek: 2 * 26 for scores, 12 * 32 * 2 for houses
 jacek: probably i could get away with normal inputs for scors
 MSmits: why the *2 for houses?
 MSmits: or is it 6 * 2&#160;?
 jacek: 0..31 seeds, x2 for side to move
 MSmits: oh ok, you could flip there
 MSmits: symmetry
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: player to move is always lower houses
 MSmits: flipping is super chea[
 jacek: ah well
 MSmits: cheap, negligble
 jacek: welp robo does the flip
 darkhorse64: my nnfs book recommandation is independant from Antisquid's. It looks like we are at least 3 to see its value for nn noobs
 MSmits: it's good, because it's so well structured, it's easy to skip the stuff you know
 Wontonimo: update, I pulled the -1/0/1 into my xor nn that uses 5 hidden neurons and it can't solve xor
 MSmits: i mean i dont mind rereading about weights and biases, but i dont need to learn the derivative of x squaered is 2x&#160;:)
 MSmits: Wontonimo but xor doesnt use -1 does it&#160;?
 RoboStac: for the -1,0,1 thing earlier, my view has always been it doesn't make much difference for the 1/-1 case but it makes the 0 case really hard to deal with (as there isn't a single weight  + bias that can make that positive and the other two negative so it would always need extra layers) 
 AntiSquid: you mean one hot encoding? @_@ why call it one-hot ... like hot what? hotdog&#160;?
 MSmits: but would it be bad to have extra layers?
 MSmits: one of the possibilities is 1
 MSmits: alll others are 0
 jacek: more expensive
 MSmits:  is *hot*
 MSmits: 1 is
 Wontonimo: conceptually MSmits , can 1 hiddenlayer learn  to output true if only one of the two -1/0/1 inputs is 0
 Wontonimo: and the answer is , i don't think so
 MSmits: it seems like a fun experiment anyways. It's easy to test with a simple TTT example
 RoboStac: extra layers are bad if you have processing time / size limits to deal with. Even without it'll probably increase training time with no real benefit
 AntiSquid: maybe darkhorse64, i recommended sentdex before he brought up his book though :Phoped he'd stream one of the contests, never happened though
 MSmits: RoboStac do you then also have hundreds of inputs for oware?
 MSmits: like jacek&#160;?
 RoboStac: yeah, 32x14
 RoboStac: though I only changed to that a couple of weeks ago
 RoboStac: after jacek convinced me
 MSmits: what did you have before?
 RoboStac: before that it was 14 floats
 MSmits: that worked quite well though
 jacek: but this one works weller
 RoboStac: yeah, but not as well (especially from a training / size perspective)
 MSmits: hmm ok, and i guess you clamp the 32, incase the rare 33 seed happens
 KalamariKing: what game is this for?
 MSmits: oware
 darkhorse64: I'll gladly acknowledge you were the first
 jacek: my recent come back at oware was made by making the nn predict 6x times faster, and overall 2.5-3x more nodes explored
 jacek: and really i dont know how
 jacek: my modification should give at most 2x speedup for nn part
 RoboStac: I probably should experiment with oware more, this was just the first one trained after changing inputs
 MSmits: there could be something that autovectorized
 MSmits: jacek
 MSmits: and didnt before
 MSmits: because you simplified the code
 jacek: heck, now even the nn isnt the bottleneck now, but move generations and make/unmake
 MSmits: mmh you need my sim :P
 darkhorse64: bitboard it&#160;!
 MSmits: weird though
 jacek: i used similar method for uttt and yielded almost 2x iterations speedup
 MSmits: i thought sim was usually negligible in performance compared to nn cost
 RoboStac: that may be some part of why the one hot one is much better for me - getting rid of the extra layers meant it is now 3x faster
 Wontonimo: another update from training... after changing the init values of the NN, it can learn using -1/0/1  if out of 2 cells only one is empty
 jacek: yeah, once again i did something that works and i dont know why
 MSmits: i guess the large number of inputs does not affect the speed much because it's just the first layer thats more expensive
 RoboStac: even though the first layer is so much bigger it's not slower because you still are only actually doing 14 sets of weights
 jacek: oh i have it in lookup table, this is really only 14 * HIDDEN for loop
 RoboStac: you just skip lots  instead
 MSmits: ohh right
 MSmits: I guess there would come a point where you have to let go of the one hot
 MSmits: say the discrete possibilities would be much larger
 Wontonimo: here is the tensorflow python code  to prove my claim <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gist.github.com/panchishin/a0a6bd3b9119aba6818e95908c54aa49">https://gist.github.com/panchishin/a0a6bd3b9119aba6818e95908c54aa49</a>
 jacek: like unlimited score
 RoboStac: yeah, I was trying to go full one hot for the contest but couldn't make that sensible for suns/score
 MSmits: sure yeah
 Wontonimo: i *like* the idea  of one-hot more though
 MSmits: Wontonimo no proof needed, i believe you. Will try stuff myself anyways&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: I'm sharing.  Not about not believing me.
 Wontonimo: cool cool
 jacek: one hot in oware just grasps the concept of empty house, 1-2 seeds being different than other houses
 jacek: some domain knowledge
 MSmits: Wontonimo i'll save the code, will get back to it at some point, thanks
 KalamariKing: oware is cg right
 MSmits: es
 KalamariKing: wait its literally mancalla
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: no its not
 MSmits: mancala is a different game
 MSmits: there are many games of this type
 MSmits: same board, different rules
 KalamariKing: oh I didn't read too much into it, lemme check it out
 MSmits: walking the dog for a while, ttyl&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: have fun
 MSmits: thanks
 KalamariKing: I heard someone talking about actor-critic for this, how would that work
 Wontonimo: I think that was used to mean "value function".  If that's so, then you'd use the NN to judge the value of the current board.  Good for eval at the bottom of minimax, or other non-terminal search
 KalamariKing: Yeah, I get all that, but someone was talking about training an actor-critic, possibly as player and opp respectively, and then uploading the actor
 KalamariKing: No search func
 MSmits: hmm actor critic is different in that it outputs a move instead of a value using a policy right?
 MSmits: or possibly both
 AntiSquid: you can design the output independant from the algo itself
 AntiSquid: actor critic is almost like having 2 different NN in one
 Wontonimo: ah, sorry  KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: Yeah, and they almost train each other
 AntiSquid: you have the learner and the teacher
 AntiSquid: or critic
 MSmits: isnt azero using this?
 MSmits: because it learns both policy and value
 MSmits: actor and critic
 AntiSquid: no, i think an example would be something like image identification with adverserial attacks such as adding one pixel to the image to confuse the NN whether it's really a bear
 KalamariKing: for e.x. generating handwriting, because that's my most recent actor-critic (simple ik, just basics)The critic learns what a '4' looks like, while the actor generates pretty-much-random imagesThe critic can then update the actor; the end result is they both slowly learn to produce handwriting
 MSmits: hmm ok
 KalamariKing: Kinda interesting, and different than nns like cnns, since its generating the images from noise
 AntiSquid: i shared this before, but here it is again, writing A3C from scratch: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcIx_TBu90Q&amp;t=2170s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcIx_TBu90Q&amp;t=2170s</a>
 MSmits: this says that azero also uses actor/critic
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://marksaroufim.medium.com/how-to-solve-board-games-8375847c6577">https://marksaroufim.medium.com/how-to-solve-board-games-8375847c6577</a>
 AntiSquid: and before he releases a book, i advertised him first :P
 AntiSquid: actually i think he has a book too somewhere
 KalamariKing: But how would you apply actor critic to a board game
 KalamariKing: Would it look for 'good moves'? or would they progressively train each other?
 AntiSquid: i misremember then MSmits, maybe i've seen this info and forgot about it
 MSmits: sec KalamariKing i'll explain
 AntiSquid: i do too much theory study to be honest
 AntiSquid: like anyone heard of transformers here? :P
 jacek: the cars?
 AntiSquid: no ... 
 KalamariKing: the voltage booster?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/what-is-a-transformer-d07dd1fbec04">https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/what-is-a-transformer-d07dd1fbec04</a>
 MSmits: ok so KalamariKing, azero has two things in its mcts search. The network provides a good move (policy) and a value (critic)
 AntiSquid: heard about LSTM or GRU&#160;?
 MSmits: when you train it, it learns both at once
 MSmits: and i guess implicitly the two parts teach eachother
 KalamariKing: Oh cool, ok thanks
 MSmits: as for our earlier discussion about one-hot and input. You can have a similar discussion about score and W/L output. A game can have an endgame score that decides the winner and you can choose to let the network predict the score or predict the winner
 KalamariKing: anti yeah, why
 MSmits: in oware, if you precict score instead of winner, you can use scoreless states and not have score-input
 MSmits: there are 20 different ways to have a specific pit-layout with 28 seeds on them, with scoreless it is only 1. Wonder if that gains you something
 AntiSquid: because those help you understand the theory of transformers better
 AntiSquid: KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: I see that they're different, but how?
 KalamariKing: scalability?
 AntiSquid: arhitecture, efficiency ... data required to train, check the article
 AntiSquid: amount of data *
 AntiSquid: well someone explained it as "it translates stuff into a language of it's own" before translating it into the output ... which is a bit of a round about explanation, but it works
 AntiSquid: but then same could be said about any model that has a form of memory
 jacek: :thinking:
 fenrir: the words actor/critic may be used in different ways, but for AZ I think the right one is policy/value
 MSmits: could be, terms are confused a lot in AI
 fenrir: where I know acrot/critic is in refinforcement learing (REINFORCE/A2C/A3C) where the actor is the policy, and the critic is used to 'critic' the actual move (good/bad)
 fenrir: it is not the actual game value
 MSmits: ahh ok
 fenrir: (at least while training)
 fenrir: it is more like the value the actor willhave if it play every move using its policy
 MSmits: I see
 7_ajinkya: how're you guys so fast man... unbelievable 
 jacek: their wife must be complaining tho
 MSmits: clashers that get a repeat problem, just paste in their previous answer  7_ajinkya. There are around 600 unique problems
 MSmits: it takes a while
 MSmits: before they repeat
 MSmits: most  of us here arent clashers though, including me. Just about everything else on CG is more interesting than coc
 7_ajinkya: oh i see... coc is fun though for building quick logic... i anyway code just for fun
 MSmits: as do most of us&#160;:)
 MSmits: here anyways
 fenrir: I think in AZ, the value is more the actual game value, the policy being only a 'guide' to avoid wasting time looking for useless node. But well, I think it is heavily biased by the policy
 MSmits: yeah thats how the mcts part works, but i wonder if in training the two parts might have an actor/critic kind of relationship. I don't know enough about the subject though
 jacek: i think this is more for alphago (before zero). policy and value were separate networks
 MSmits: oh right
 jacek: mcts search moves by policy and value network tells how good they were
 MSmits: policy was trained with supervised learning right?
 MSmits: before zero
 fenrir: it's more the opposite, you search by value, the policy allows you to look at the most promising node instead of every nodes
 MSmits: you search by both afaik
 fenrir: in AZ, you may use seperate network or not, that's independant
 fenrir: it may help or not
 MSmits: separate network helps in situations where you need *just* the policy or *just* the value
 MSmits: assuming the two networks would be smaller
 jacek: implementation detail :shrug_tone1:
 reCurse: Sure but when do you need just one or the other
 reCurse: I always miss the interesting convos
 jacek: ok lets back to discussing clashes
 MSmits: no idea reCurse
 RoboStac: whether they're separate or not they're still trained to work together and removing one would most likely make the whole system weaker 
 MSmits: hey i  have an unanswered question for you reCurse. 
 MSmits: Do you think it would be worth it to make oware predict score instead of win
 MSmits: to then use scoreless states and avoid score input
 reCurse: What do you expect to achieve with that?
 RoboStac: I still don't understand how you think that can work with a tree search 
 MSmits: i used it before RoboStac
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: the statespace is about 20x smaller
 MSmits: with scoreless states
 reCurse: Ok... and?
 RoboStac: but if two different sets of moves end up in the same state (but with different scores) they need to eval differently 
 MSmits: they dojt
 MSmits: the best move is the same
 MSmits: independent of history
 ZoteLeRedoutable: hello i'm making a clash of code game, i haven't find the solution of my own problem x)if u wanna take a look: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/677683039c99ce3a75af342d1f0e925a9a26">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/677683039c99ce3a75af342d1f0e925a9a26</a>
 MSmits: doesnt matter how many points you already have
 jacek: i fail to see where would you put that in tree search
 RoboStac: thats fine for a single best move from a current position
 MSmits: well the value in your mcts, is the predicted future net-score
 MSmits: instead of your chance t owin
 MSmits: you backpropagate expected seeds gained
 RoboStac: but that's not even possible to backprop unless it knows the score
 reCurse: I'm still at the expected benefit part
 MSmits: RoboStac i mean expected seeds gained in the future
 RoboStac: eg after one move you win 5 seeds - every move after that now has a lower score to backprop
 MSmits: not the past, it's score
 MSmits: less
 MSmits: yes, when you backpropagate you add captured seeds
 MSmits: so that doesnt matter
 jacek: do you mean only your own seeds?
 MSmits: it makes backpropagation a bit more complicated
 MSmits: no it's a net seed thing
 jacek: or your seeds - opponent seeds
 MSmits: yes that
 MSmits: ido this in my meta mcts
 MSmits: it works
 MSmits: it doesnt maximize win, it maximizes seeds gained
 MSmits: reCurse i am getting to your point
 RoboStac: yeah, but that isn't what you want to maximise
 RoboStac: you want to maximise win 
 MSmits: it's easy to combine this with an endgame book
 RoboStac: even if it's just by 1 seed
 MSmits: because endgame books have seed counts
 MSmits: then you can stop at 9 seeds on the board, even at depth 5 in the search or something
 MSmits: i know you want to maximize win, but maximizing seeds maximizes win as well
 reCurse: Whether it's seeds or wins shouldn't matter
 JohnCM: the tree search is a way of policy improvement in az.You use it to improve the move probabilities
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: so if seeds allows you to use some extra tools like an endgame book at a leaf in your tree, isnt that a benefit?
 reCurse: That's a matter of state not evaluation
 MSmits: of course
 RoboStac: if you've got an endgame book you know the winchance too though 
 MSmits: but if you predict the number of seeds gained
 MSmits: then you can replace the prediction with the book
 MSmits: and you have an exact prediction
 MSmits: (At some point)
 MSmits: at some depth i mean
 reCurse: You can do this with a regular win evaluation though
 MSmits: yeah, with a large degree of confidence, sure, but not as good as an endgame book will do
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: When you reach the state with endbook
 reCurse: You backprop the book result instead
 MSmits: oh yes if the root is there
 reCurse: No need to touch evaluation
 MSmits: but i am talking about leafs in your searcg
 MSmits: leafs can also get to the book
 reCurse: Same thing?
 MSmits: hmm
 RoboStac: if the endgame book says this position is +4 seeds you can work out if you win or lose from that position
 MSmits: yes thats true
 RoboStac: and just backprop that
 MSmits: you're correct, I missed that
 MSmits: then the only advantage is scoreless states. Does it help to have a smaller statespace?
 MSmits: when solving games it does help a lot and people generally do this
 jacek: because it takes less GB in your disk?
 MSmits: less solving time too
 MSmits: the game simply becomes less complex
 reCurse: This is very different from solving
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: and i know very little about it in practice, hence my question
 reCurse: If the input matters then it will learn to ignore it
 reCurse: *doesn't
 MSmits: it will of course matter if you dont treat the state as scoreless
 MSmits: the only way to make it not matter, if the search handles the state as scoreless
 MSmits: (different backpropagation method)
 MSmits: but that requires to predict seeds instead of wins
 MSmits: you need to know *by how much* you win
 reCurse: You're asking about if it's better with less state space
 reCurse: I'm telling you it can simplify the state space if it doesn't see it helping
 reCurse: The extra info
 MSmits: hmm maybe i should rephrase
 reCurse: What you output is completely separate
 MSmits: will it reduce calculations required
 MSmits: if there's less input
 reCurse: Very little
 MSmits: or will my scheme require a bigger network in the end
 MSmits: which means more calculation
 reCurse: It will literally only matter on the first layer
 reCurse: Then the rest is the same
 MSmits: i am not sure, the score is in fact very important if you dont do it scoreless
 jacek: but i have only one layer :v
 MSmits: so the score is going through the network in an important way
 reCurse: Well yeah obviously
 reCurse: You're mixing too many topics at once
 MSmits: i guess so yes
 MSmits: cant help it&#160;:)
 reCurse: What you output is independent
 reCurse: But if you ask it to output win
 reCurse: And you withhold critical info
 reCurse: Then yes it's bad
 MSmits: yeah thats bad
 MSmits: i get that
 reCurse: So if you don't input score you need to predict seeds gained, naturally
 reCurse: Does it help on calculation, barely
 CamTheHelpDesk: did rankings not update last night? 🤔
 reCurse: You have X * H connections at the first layer
 MSmits: maybe on convergence in training?
 reCurse: So you brought that down to (X-1) * H
 MSmits: no idea how this would work out
 reCurse: The other layers are identical
 reCurse: You might save some time if that input was useless, it will need to weigh it down first
 MSmits: what if you need less nodes in the layer if you dont input score
 MSmits: in the 1 hidden layer or 2 or whatever
 reCurse: That's a different topic
 MSmits: sure
 Darkboy: hi
 reCurse: Determining the size of what will work
 reCurse: Is a whole other can of worms
 MSmits: i understand that my question has many layers
 reCurse: Maybe it works better, maybe it doesn't
 MSmits: so i should probably just try it 
 Darkboy: hi
 MSmits: cant hurt
 reCurse: You need to threshold that with number of comparisons possible
 reCurse: Whether you need to compute more possibilities than accurate eval
 MSmits: more possibilities?
 reCurse: Nodes
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: what kind of last activation function would a seed predictor use?
 reCurse: Linear
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: Unless you don't care about precision at the extremes
 reCurse: Then sigmoid, tanh, etc
 reCurse: don't care = care
 reCurse: Wait that was right
 reCurse: I hate not having edits...
 jacek: i would care less
 reCurse: I usually type first and correct stuff later
 Darkboy: hi
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: sigmoid/tanh has asymptotic behavior, so less precision at edges, its clear
 Darkboy: im 9
 jacek: good for you
 Darkboy: why
 MSmits: thanks for clearing some of this up reCurse
 MSmits: going back to practicing with basics in my nnfs book&#160;:)
 jacek: MSmits i only did eval the normal way, i still cant picture the seeds thing
 MSmits: it's a bit complicated, lets say if i get it to work, i will write it up, if not, you can forget it&#160;:)
 jacek: as first thing i would stick to the basics and if it works, then would try some more exotic approach
 reCurse: Yeah the important is to get anything basic to work
 reCurse: You can add the fancy stuff later and use that as a regression test
 CamTheHelpDesk: anyone know if there's more than 5 homepage paths
 jacek: if you can get the eval right, you then know your NN works
 reCurse: I feel like we're having conversations in the playground sometimes
 MSmits: to me the seeds thing isnt really more complicated, its just different. I used it before
 MSmits: but harder to explain
 jacek: if the seeds thing wouldnt work, you wouldnt know if its faulty NN or other bugs
 MSmits: oh, because i already know other approaches work from you guys
 MSmits: good point
 MSmits: but i might start with a simple ttt or something
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 fenrir: with NN: always start simple first, because even with huge bug, the NN may workaround a lot of issue and hide it
 MSmits: btw dots and boxes has this too. Scoreless states where only the board matters and the net score from the rest of the game. That's where i got the idea from
 fenrir: I had a bot in SC21 that was quite ok (~50 early legend) trained in selfplay, where both player had the exact same inputs ...
 Gumarkamole: Does someone have issues with Kotlin too? My code passes all the test but after pending results I have 0%
 fenrir: (ie player 2 was seeing the input of player 1)
 MSmits: fenrir yeah a lot of times re curse/jace k and robo told of bugs they discovered very late
 fenrir: but it didn't prevent it of 'working not so bad'
 MSmits: when the nn was already working
 reCurse: Oh boy yeah that sounds all too familiar
 fenrir:&#160;:)
 RoboStac: if you do try it on TTT first be very careful with tree search methods as they'll find endgame states so quickly the nn doesn't matter much
 fenrir: I know I have to look for this bug (not the first time), but I have still bugged it&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah that was my worry RoboStac, maybe i will use it as a policy nn only, 9 moves available = 9 outputs
 MSmits: no search
 MSmits: i think jacek did this
 Darkboy: Has any one seen this code
 reCurse: I still think CSB runner is the best
 reCurse: I can hardly find an example where it's complicated enough yet very easy to figure out if it's right
 MSmits: for some reason it feels very complicated to me reCurse
 jacek: MSmits i did 1-ply search
 RoboStac: I've still never got anything useful to work on csb 
 RoboStac: probably should try that again at some point
 MSmits: oh jacek you just took the best out of 9 value lookups?
 fenrir: a runner alone in CSB is quite easy to do and yes a good training example
 Darkboy: Input//"hello world"
 jacek: MSmits yes
 fenrir: I started with tha, I think pb4 also (but unsure, don't want to speak at his place)
 MSmits: that would probably be easi
 RoboStac: last time I tried my runner learnt to only turn one direction and just kept varying velocity to make the circles bigger / smaller 
 MSmits: +er
 reCurse: Oh yeah that rings a bell
 reCurse: lol
 fenrir: if RL, the entropy regulrization is really really mandatory
 MSmits: thats what the first drawings of my daughter looked like RoboStac&#160;:)
 fenrir: otherwise very fast convergence to a minimum
 fenrir: I mean local minimum (an a bad one)
 reCurse: Maybe I'll write a CSB runner tutorial at some point... don't hold your breath though
 reCurse: I think it's a great introduction to RL in general, CG regardless
 MSmits: hmm, you're not the first to say that, but there is also bias since that is how you got into it
 RoboStac: it was a long time ago though, probably should try it again
 reCurse: Of course there's bias
 reCurse: I've also seen what else is out there
 jacek: nn has bias, its a good thing
 fenrir: there is a game with a runner only in CG
 fenrir: SL no&#160;?
 jacek: search race?
 fenrir: yep
 fenrir: I think that could be a good way to test a runner only
 fenrir: here I did a DDPG
 darkhorse64: SF2442&#160;?
 MSmits: ye innory also said csb is better than oware to start with
 reCurse: I'm pretty sure he meant csb runner
 reCurse: Real csb is a whole other story
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: Like not even close
 MSmits: that makes sense
 MSmits: so that other optim then
 MSmits: search race
 reCurse: Yes and no
 MSmits: how so
 reCurse: If you get it to run under CG somehow, sure
 reCurse: Much easier to get it running with whatever you want without constriants
 MSmits: oh you mean locall
 reCurse: The viewer is much easier to recode than working under CG constraints
 MSmits: ah right
 MSmits: yeah, seems like a nice project
 reCurse: Oware is simple enough, problem is it's very difficult to see if it's right
 reCurse: Unless you spend time studying the game
 MSmits: mmh i have my meta mcts
 reCurse: CSB? There's a checkpoint.
 reCurse: If it doesn't drive towards it, it's a complete failure
 MSmits: yeah much easier to see
 MSmits: well I have a ton of time between now and around september, I hope to get at least a good bot in 1  arena. Will not start any other project before i do. Think thats realistic?
 KalamariKing: Thats a lot of time, I'd say so
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: i know reCurse spent many months also, but I think I have more help/resources now, mainly people telling me what works and what doesnt
 fenrir: in CSB, my first NN was a search without doing the gradient, I don't remember the exact name, but basically it's a perurbation of the NN coffeicent, accumulate a bunch of run, and modify in the righ direction
 MSmits: no gradient?
 MSmits: oh just adjust weights by a fraction?
 MSmits: like 1/1000 of the weight value
 MSmits: the nnfs book mentions that as a first order improvement over complete randomly generated weights
 fenrir: it was an algorithm search when the function is not derivable
 MSmits: nice if you got that to work
 Wontonimo: i used TPS to do that with very good results.
 fenrir: it kind of worked, not fast but it idid
 MSmits: TPS?
 Wontonimo: mybad
 MSmits: TPE?
 Wontonimo: aka Hyperopt 
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/">http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/</a>
 MSmits: ye google found it fast:
 struct: Hi MSmits I also bought the book
 struct: Takes me a while to understand some stuff though
 ill-be-waiting-outside: hi
 MSmits: I have trouble with the backpropagation part. Not because i dont understand the math, but because it's so dry. I guess there's no way to make that more interesting though. Other than that I had no problem so far. 
 MSmits: let me know if you have questions
 MSmits: i didnt go beyond about page 200
 MSmits: (yet)
 struct: Im entering chapter 5 atm (page 111) error loss
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: Sometimes I just have to read multiple times to understand
 struct: Because this is brand new stuff
 MSmits: there are videos too
 MSmits: they end around there
 MSmits: maybe a bit further, i think loss is in there
 MSmits: backpropagation isnt
 struct: yeah I saw up to softmax
 MSmits: ah yes, there's 1 more after
 MSmits: softmax is 6 i think, there's a 7th
 struct: ill watch  it too
 davilla: which fields in the description are visible when the class is a reverse?
 davilla: Input? Output? Constraints?
 davilla: Or is it just the 4 examples?
 MrPapaya: none
 MrPapaya: only tests
 davilla: cool thanks
 Wontonimo: anyone give any thoughts to which multi they are planning on attacking with NN first?
 Wontonimo: it would be great if we all dogpile the same one
 Wontonimo: oware-abapa was mentioned
 VizGhar: So this is the site, where future machine learning experts will be raised?
 ZarthaxX: and you will get smashed in future contests, prob yes
 KalamariKing: oware sounds like a good nn challenge
 Kramerius: i just joined this. 9th grade, first coding class. This is scary
 KalamariKing: say, why are we all learning nns this morning
 KalamariKing: Kramerius That's pretty epic. What exactly is scary?
 struct: I dont expect to make one any time soon
 Kramerius: no idea what half of this means
 KelvinAndHubbles: actually yeah, theres only like 10 input nodes for oware, might make one and run it through a GANN
 struct: I struggled quite a bit on early chapters
 VizGhar: you mean chat Kramerius?
 Kramerius: no, in general
 Kramerius: and yes the chat too
 Kramerius: i think before i do anything, ill just spend some time looking at the documentation
 KalamariKing: chats really advanced today I'll give you that
 KalamariKing: I'm somewhat experienced in nns so I can at least contribute today
 Kramerius: What is NNS?
 Wontonimo: NeuralNetworks
 KalamariKing: Plural of NN, neural network
 KalamariKing: Machine learning (think ai)
 Kramerius: Oh
 KalamariKing: Kramerius honestly experience in the field is better. The practices might be too hard if you're just starting out, so play a few clashes or smth
 VizGhar: Kramerius ignore chat&#160;:) only open it if you have specific question... You will get lost here immediately
 Kramerius: i think ive seen a video on that
 MSmits: really dont worry about this Kramerius, it's not always like this. Just have some fun with puzzles. That's what i was doing on CG 3 yrs ago
 ZarthaxX: so funny that recurs win with nn and now everyone is on that boat
 MSmits: blissfully ignorant of everything to do with bots
 ZarthaxX: following the winner :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: won*
 Wontonimo: didn't that happen with MCTS also
 KalamariKing: I remember someone telling me that a nn would be irrational
 MSmits: ZarthaxX nahh, this has been going on for over a year at least in my case
 ZarthaxX: not for you smits
 MSmits: did you not see me get wrecked in every leaderboard :P
 VizGhar: ++ just play easy puzzles, read forums about solutions and maybe a bit of CoC
 ZarthaxX: but everyone else lol
 KalamariKing: So I wasted all of my time learning search algos and stuff, when I already knew nns
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Kramerius: On youtube, there was a guy who used NNS to beat Falppy bird or something
 ZarthaxX: i saw your struggle
 ZarthaxX: fighting with your handmade nns :P
 struct: ZarthaxX I wanted to try it before, but never started it
 MSmits: lol
 ZarthaxX: struct but this was like a motivator right haha
 struct: Even relu took me a while to understand
 MSmits: Kramerius yeah flappy bird is one of the things you can do
 Wontonimo: I used scratch.mit.edu to do RL for a self driving car
 Wontonimo: well, it was a dog
 RoboStac: I think it happens to some extent after most contests, just in this case it's getting discussion in chat as it's a bit more complicated / unusual (and something that the regular chatters haven't done before)
 Wontonimo: not a car
 MSmits: self driving dog?
 MSmits: or a dog learnign to drive?
 MSmits: a dog on wheels?
 RoboStac: a dog learning to write a nn 
 KalamariKing: Or a car learning to dog
 MSmits: oh ofc
 MSmits: btw, scratch wow... talk about low tech&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: scratch rl?
 ZarthaxX: how can you do that
 MSmits: thats what i did with students before i could even code 
 ZarthaxX: its scratch, block programming
 ZarthaxX: wtf?
 jacek: KalamariKing you still need search though
 KalamariKing: jacek yeah ig
 maazshakeel: Hi guys
 KalamariKing: Hello
 ill-be-waiting-outside: hey 
 maazshakeel: How are you all?
 Hasuzawa: just curious, can I use numpy of python in codingame, I figured the quickest solution to a problem is n by m linear equation with excess condition
 jacek: they are up to something
 MSmits: yes Hasuzawa i think numpy is an option
 jacek: yes, there is numpy in here
 jacek: and panda i think
 Hasuzawa: cool, thx
 MSmits: :panda_face:
 Hasuzawa: now I dont have to use crammer rule
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX i think for this contest specifically it can work better, doubt it works for every contest
 AntiSquid: for example: pacman 
 AntiSquid: at least it's far more difficult
 Wontonimo: i just had to double check on the self driving dog.  not rl, it was hand tuned.&#160;:(  I didn't lie, I just remembered wrong
 AntiSquid: here it was favoring optimizing eval and since that's what NN is good at of course there was such a massive lead with a well trained model
 MSmits: I dont think you need to use NN for the entire thing. You can take a part of the game thats hard to evaluate and train a NN to do it
 jacek: no, lets NN everything
 AntiSquid: i guess, you can do "NN" for the RPS minigame part, or use the already available algorithms online for it#
 MSmits: allright, I'm convinced
 MSmits: let's nn everything!
 KalamariKing: I agree
 MSmits: oh btw, jacek, wanna see how far i got with connect4 so far. I recently turned on a 10 game paralllel version of the meta mcts, building on the old version
 AntiSquid: VizGhar not really, this isn't an ML focused site, i am not an expert to say who would be best where, but i am sure the folks that train models all the time would have an advantage over everyone here
 Wontonimo: i'm looking forward to training my NN with MCTS, then using that trained NN in my MCTS.
 jacek: and how far did you go
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fae6edbe-0eb4-4ed5-b242-f24fceb2be1f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fae6edbe-0eb4-4ed5-b242-f24fceb2be1f</a>
 MSmits: for a while i did just move 1, it's doing all again now
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: thats why move 1 has 10 million games
 MSmits: pretty sure it's p2, draw, p1, p1, p1 when it gets solved
 jacek: but theres summer soon
 KalamariKing: I was summoned
 AntiSquid: is that with steal included MSmits&#160;?
 KalamariKing: Where was the ping wtf
 MSmits: this is without steal, so this tells you to start with move 1 or get a forced loss as p1
 MSmits: because move1 is pretty sure to end in draw. The search hits leafs that are solved in draw with the principal variation
 AntiSquid: 51.7% so p2 is always at advantage with the steal ... so like in the popular 7x6 version&#160;? :D the first move has the advantage
 MSmits: no, the 51,7% goes above and below 50%
 MSmits: it needs to completely solve lost branches too
 MSmits: so that affects the percentages
 MSmits: just in case a bad branch still leads to win (otherwise it is not a proof)
 MSmits: i should probably stop backpropagating when there is a draw option. That would solve the fluctuation
 MSmits: I kinda want to go all the way and solve this, because wiki says noone has yet
 AntiSquid: ya definitely some branches can lead to a win, they do for 6x7 (i just know trust me0
 MSmits: 8x8 is biggest solve, 9x7 would be next
 AntiSquid: saw chat earlier, anyone who doesn't have the nnfs book&#160;? :D
 MSmits: not me, I don't not have it
 AntiSquid: what are you reading then?
 MSmits: nnfs
 MSmits: because i have it
 AntiSquid: @_@
 jacek: neural network for file system?
 MSmits: neural network from scratch (in python)
 AntiSquid: McBitz jokes, where's Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but it will be worse
 MSmits: cant me worse than mine Automaton2000
 MSmits: be
 Automaton2000: don't think he can do
 jacek: or AutomatonNN?
 KalamariKing: I think AutomatonNN is no longer with us, succeeded by Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: maybe i should read the rules again
 MSmits: Automaton2000 dont read the rules and use pruneArray
 Automaton2000: if you go to the chat
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 is the original one, KalamariKing, well this is second iteration
 KalamariKing: I'm in the chat rn what do you want Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: we do have a lot of bugs in your code
 Automaton2000: but when i try to make my code cleaner
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid oh sick
 KalamariKing: thanks
 MSmits: wait, is he telling us he saw our code and it has bugs?
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 why would you try to clean buggy code
 Automaton2000: what you need to put in some time
 AntiSquid: use the search bar on the site to search for automaton, KalamariKing, check the puzzles out
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 if my code is as buggy as you said, then fine
 Automaton2000: but i'm saying i like do actions like harvest, seeding
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid I see the 'build your own Automaton2000' rn, its actually pretty cool
 Automaton2000: makes me want to puke
 MSmits: btw, this C# mutex thing is awesome. So easy. I think Astrobytes suggest this? Or someone else. Anyways thanks
 KalamariKing: wdym mutex
 MSmits: for parallelization, so you dont get many threads accessing and modifying the same variables 
 jacek: mutex eh
 jacek: and virtual loss?
 MSmits: i have 10 visits, not sure if thats optimal
 MSmits: 10 vists for one that is being played through
 MSmits: or if more than once 10x
 jacek: per thread?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: if multiple threads go through same node
 KalamariKing: when did I reach bronze in two games
 MSmits: then that node has x times 10 visits in UCT
 KalamariKing: I've only played one bot game, csb
 KalamariKing: just got a random acheivment
 jacek: no spring challenge?
 KalamariKing: ohhhhh
 KalamariKing: that makes sense thanks
 hypers: heh, I've got achievement for two golds and i'm not in the gold in spring challenge
 hypers: just in one more contest as far as a remember
 hypers: also happend minutes ago when rating was updated
 hypers: I hope they wouldn't change their mind
 hypers: as i'm already proud of myself&#160;:)))
 KalamariKing: rating was updated a few mins ago?
 KalamariKing: interesting
 hypers: as far as I can tell by Clash of Code to
 KalamariKing: Oh sick
 hypers: i was not in the 500 this morning, now I've moved up as a result of today's games 
 hypers: but I expected update to happen tomorrow
 KalamariKing: I thought your rating updates after every game
 KalamariKing: It does for me
 MSmits: the CP ranking updates at night
 struct: coc ranks update after a game is complete
 struct: But CP is daily yeah
 hypers: I might have looked at CODINPOINTS
 MSmits: thats cp
 hypers: oh, thanks I see now
 asrinivasan007: hello
 asrinivasan007: orz
 jacek: good afternoon

 bora399: I need to improve my coding skills, any suggestions&#160;? I can't solve medium puzzles
 KalamariKing: bora399 The puzzle difficulty isn't consistent, I don't blame you
 KalamariKing: Some mediums are easy, others are like expert+
 bora399: oh okay thx for message, i relaxed :D
 Wontonimo: some of the medium puzzles take me several hours, and many times I have to think on it casually for a day or two.
 Smelty: yep
 struct: This is why I dont do puzzles
 Smelty: some hard puzzles r easier than some medium puzzles
 jacek: never run with scissors
 King_Coda: How do you hide chat using the url?

 Wiilss: damnnn
 Wiilss: facts
 Illusive: if australias 12 hours ahead, why didnt they warn us about 911
 551D: tree is a log but not every log is tree
 Illusive: what is it then
 Wiilss: twisty
 Illusive: a twig
 551D: their news were late 
 Illusive: my guy
 Illusive: no
 Illusive: log
 Illusive: is log
 Illusive: js 
 Illusive: is

 ZarthaxX: i wanted to try running bots on web
 eulerscheZahl: so the connect4 bot is a .net DLL which is executed in .net runtime via webasm
 ZarthaxX: not a good idea i guess tho
 ZarthaxX: damn
 UUolfo: Side note 2nd?!? dangggggg whose first and how do i tell?
 ZarthaxX: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global</a>
 eulerscheZahl: royale reclaimed the lead
 UUolfo: ty, well done.
 ZarthaxX: probably clashes e.e
 eulerscheZahl: i dropped in the spring 2021 leaderboard
 UUolfo: looks like bot programming
 AntiSquid: 4 CP difference ZarthaxX 
 eulerscheZahl: 104
 AntiSquid: 104 CP nvm
 ZarthaxX: lol
 AntiSquid: ya basically clash diff by 100 points
 jrke: damn dbdr also in the race
 eulerscheZahl: he will take over soon
 eulerscheZahl: his points are from games that still gain more players and total points
 jrke: yeah one those are d&amp;b
 ZarthaxX: true
 jrke: and i am also a guru now&#160;:)
 Wiilss: hi
 jrke: just a rank above ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: you took my place jrke
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: i will fix it, someday
 eulerscheZahl: was about to mention that
 jrke: time to sleep... gn bye and hoping ZarthaxX will fix his rank
 ZarthaxX: haha nah
 ZarthaxX: not for now
 ZarthaxX:  gn!
 AntiSquid: when you going to bed ZarthaxX&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: in 10 hours
 eulerscheZahl: it's 14:30 for him
 eulerscheZahl: wait 14:53
 AntiSquid: 1 AM&#160;?
 jacek: and when you goind to bed, euler
 MSmits: in 1  hr
 eulerscheZahl: in 1h
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: and 7 minutes
 AntiSquid: :D
 MSmits: euler has perfect self control and self discipline
 AntiSquid: it's usually 8 AM here when he goes to bed, makes it look weird
 ZarthaxX: i hate this toad, always knows my time 
 AntiSquid: 8 PM *
 eulerscheZahl: i still feel a little tired after the contest
 ZarthaxX: who doesnt?
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: they are getting more intense
 eulerscheZahl: but long weekend ahead :ship:
 ZarthaxX: true :O
 jacek: long?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 days weekends are the best
 MSmits: whats with the boat
 AntiSquid: you can search the time online ZarthaxX&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=time+arhentina">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=time+arhentina</a>
 MSmits: you going on the water?
 ZarthaxX: he is a toad
 eulerscheZahl: like "land in sight"
 MSmits: toadboat?
 MSmits: oh ok
 ZarthaxX: i know AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: just that the land is a public holiday
 ZarthaxX: but i think toad knows it without googling it
 MSmits: right, totally get this analogy now
 ZarthaxX: he says it too fast always lol
 eulerscheZahl: i know ZarthaxX = me -5h
 ZarthaxX: yeah that :P
 ZarthaxX: i will remember the 5
 ZarthaxX: wait, you go to sleep at nine???
 ZarthaxX: or at 10
 eulerscheZahl: 9 sounds about right
 ZarthaxX: isnt that way too early?
 ZarthaxX: why not 00 D:
 MSmits: he gets up early
 MSmits: feeds his chickens and stuff
 eulerscheZahl: around 6am
 ZarthaxX: hell
 ZarthaxX: ahhh
 AntiSquid: what about daylight savings&#160;? are those always synchronized&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: makes sense
 ZarthaxX: why tho?
 MSmits: cuz they need food
 jacek: he needs his dose of lucid dreaming
 ZarthaxX: MSmits toad feeding chickens :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: suddenly he lives in a farm
 MSmits: i dunno why, it's just educated guessing
 ZarthaxX: still no phone toad right?
 ZarthaxX: no russian telegram
 eulerscheZahl: i have landline
 MSmits: me too, no phone
 ZarthaxX: i meant mobile phone
 MSmits: and landline
 MSmits: yeah
 ZarthaxX: isnt landline dying?
 AntiSquid: my smartphone is my landline
 MSmits: i dunno. It worked ok last time i tried
 ZarthaxX: i meant like
 ZarthaxX: passing away
 eulerscheZahl: i also have a headset for the computer
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: me too, headset
 eulerscheZahl: belongs to employer but i think i can risk it :imp:
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: computer also belongs to employer?
 MSmits: i dont see the point of mobile phone
 MSmits: isn't that for like, a social life
 eulerscheZahl: using my personal screen and keyboard for work in return
 eulerscheZahl: i have a computer on my own and one from the company
 eulerscheZahl: i way i'm willing to use that windows in my free time
 ZarthaxX: notebook from company i guess?
 MSmits: same, 2 computers, one for myself and 1 for work
 AntiSquid: i have a work laptop, they kept promising work phones for a while now (smart phones too)
 MSmits: I should start playing soccer and then I'll live eulers life
 eulerscheZahl: not a notebook. more like a 20kg monster
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: 60cm deep
 ZarthaxX: thought it was normal that they gave notebooks only
 eulerscheZahl: and 40 high, 20 wide
 ZarthaxX: you can train your NNs there :D
 ZarthaxX: or mine
 eulerscheZahl: it has 2 processors with 8 cores each
 MSmits: whoa
 ZarthaxX: wtf, what do you do at your job
 eulerscheZahl: FEM machine
 ZarthaxX: MSmits i think he doesnt feed chickens
 AntiSquid: using windows in freetime? :thinking: got tired of linux&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't really need all that parallel power. it's just that this PC was spare when I needed one
 ZarthaxX: okey :thinking:
 MSmits: ah right, it was lyin' around
 MSmits: makes total sense now
 ZarthaxX: lol
 AntiSquid: it's not about what you need it for, it's what the employer can afford
 eulerscheZahl: definitely more expensive than my personal computer
 AntiSquid: is it secured? encrypted? 
 AntiSquid: how much access do you have to it
 eulerscheZahl: questions getting weird, not sure if that's the right topic for public chat
 MSmits: why do you need to know that :P
 AntiSquid: why not? curious
 MSmits: this reminds me of conversations with mad knight :P
 eulerscheZahl: let's do a teamviewer session
 MSmits: come get on teamviewer and when i ask why, why not?
 eulerscheZahl: :rofl:
 MSmits: hehe
 ZarthaxX: lol
 AntiSquid: completely different topic 
 MSmits: my point exactly :P
 AntiSquid: madao feels lonely likes to chat, different interest
 eulerscheZahl: once another user here asked me to connect to his PC with teamviewer
 AntiSquid: madao's alt?
 MSmits: well that doesnt surprise me... you help people with technical problems
 eulerscheZahl: no, i could help him with a C# problem
 AntiSquid: so did you connect?
 eulerscheZahl: but i wouldn't give any of you access to my PC. you are still somewhat strangers
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i connected to his PC
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't want anyone to touch my PC
 AntiSquid: i didn't ask for access to your PC, weird assumption
 MSmits: wouldnt do that either i think, but if anyone, it would be you
 MSmits: nahhh it would be astrobytes
 MSmits: :P
 eulerscheZahl: just saying because that random guy on chat (not even a regular user) asked me
 struct: at most screenshare
 eulerscheZahl: if i were in his shoes, i wouldn't
 AntiSquid: nobody here, i don't care, it's private @_@
 BinaryIO: eulerscheZahl  I have your location. locking in on you!
 eulerscheZahl: because I wrote the location on my profile
 AntiSquid: besides i have funny gif desktop can't have people see that
 eulerscheZahl: you are in *concentrated look* the US
 eulerscheZahl: i have a hypnotoad picture collection
 Smelty: lol
 AntiSquid: euler is a foreign spy, BinaryIO
 MSmits: we're all foreign 
 Marchete: ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD
 Smelty: ^
 MSmits: did you watch that 10 hr YT again Marchete
 Marchete: ofc
 MSmits: I know it only seems like 2 minutes, but watch the sun before and after
 Marchete: twice in a row
 eulerscheZahl: i hear that every day when writing extensions for the CAD software: "foreign application failed to initialize"
 AntiSquid: oh god MSmits, just reminds me reading some ingame chat, often seeing "oh all these foreigners not speaking my language, get out of my country" lmao
 MSmits: which game was this AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: happened in multiple ones
 MSmits: yeah, I remember chat like that in dota2
 AntiSquid: "verdamte auslaender"
 eulerscheZahl: verdammte
 MSmits: they always complained about "the russians"
 AntiSquid: ya that
 eulerscheZahl: verdamt = something that turns into a woman
 Smelty: :eyes:
 reCurse: I am now fluent with insults in spanish, portuguese and russian thanks to dota 2
 MSmits: lol reCurse
 struct: lol
 Smelty: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i know some Hindi curses thanks to kitboga
 struct: brazilians play it?
 MSmits: i hadnt watched kitboga in months and i coincidentally watched 1 last night
 MSmits: i think you need, to every once in a while
 AntiSquid: what MMR reCurse&#160;?
 reCurse: Between 3.8k and 4.2k back when pros were around... 7 or 8k I think?
 reCurse: That was years ago
 MSmits: I never got very far with that, you had to play hundreds of games to even play rated games
 reCurse: Leagues didn't even exist
 MSmits: i stopped when i was allowed to
 AntiSquid: i only played it back when it was a warcraft 3 map
 MSmits: oh thats a long time ago
 MSmits: like 15 yrs ago?
 MSmits: more even
 AntiSquid: idk, it was getting popular on ggarena or something like that 
 AntiSquid: gggaming&#160;!
 MSmits: only game i played seriously was company of heroes
 MSmits: online i mean
 MSmits: lots of strategy, people around my rating had 3x as many clicks/min
 MSmits: slow but smart :P
 reCurse: APM got perverted when people started putting too much focus on it
 AntiSquid: high APM = pro
 MSmits: depends on the game though. Some games are specifically designed to require it, like starcraft 2
 reCurse: Same result
 AntiSquid: 1212121 right click spam
 reCurse: Hardly measures anything except maybe sweatiness
 reCurse: Of course you need some good reflexes to be good but
 reCurse: Past a certain point...
 reCurse: Just realized Nerchio might be reading this, I should shut up in case I say something very stupid
 MSmits: well, with that logic most of us should keep quiet because you're here :P
 izzythehacker: idk what to do
 reCurse: Um...
 reCurse: No?
 AntiSquid: nerchio teach us the right hotkey bindings
 MSmits: I mean because i say  a lot of stuff you know much more about
 MSmits: sometimes saying stupid stuff is an opportunity to be corrected&#160;:)
 reCurse: Fine, let's just say I might be speaking with a bit too much confidence when I could get massively corrected by someone who (was?) an actual pro
 MSmits: yeah, but you can take the embarassment, it's fine
 AntiSquid: you can check if he is in chat
 AntiSquid: protoss are easy win because shields OP
 MSmits: he's not, but we log chat these days
 MSmits: it's actually way more risky for me than for you reCurse
 MSmits: i am a teacher, i often think sht, some student may read this
 AntiSquid: see? he didn't respond
 reCurse: Alright so excluding actual pros
 MSmits: if i am careful half the jokes i do i probably shouldnt :P
 reCurse: APM is most likely perverted by unnecessary sweatiness in those levels below
 reCurse: IMO
 MSmits: do you mean perverted as in inflated?
 reCurse: Yeah because it's often wrongly associated with a measure of skill
 Dartisan: Hi, for those who interest, I put nine men's morris (Multiplayer) back in the contribution.&#160;;-) Any feedback is welcome.
 MSmits: ahh ok
 reCurse: So people get it all wrong
 reCurse: I need more APM to be good
 reCurse: ...no
 MSmits: so people are just randomly clicking stuff in downtime
 AntiSquid: it's the culture, people measure APM and if it's not super high for no reason then they call you a noob
 reCurse: Exactly
 reCurse: That's royally stupid
 reCurse: Sure you need to poll your buildings etc to make sure you build stuff on time and all
 reCurse: But that's why I say past a certain point the metric is useless
 SubwayMan: Hi, is there any way to adjust the codingame editor settings?I'm really not a fan of the autocomplete
 UUolfo: I think it used to be that it was a measure of how percisely you could do x commands in y time, but it turned into just rando click 
 MSmits: games become a lot less interesting to me with these features. Like the last-hitting and deny-ing thing in dota2
 MSmits: they could have coded a feature where this was automatic
 MSmits: and you could focus on thinking
 struct: denying is a joke
 AntiSquid: like Heroes of the Storm&#160;?
 struct: dota gives me raic flashbacks
 reCurse: That's massively underestimating all the strategy that goes with it MSmits
 MSmits: i like that you dont have to do it in league of legends and hots
 jacek: is it alive still?
 reCurse: And it's not nearly as much about reflexes
 AntiSquid: "pick heal" "omg noob why not pick heal"
 MSmits: reCurse how so 
 reCurse: There's a lot of mental games that go with it, which creeps to focus, zoning, etc
 struct: its more about timing decision
 MSmits: i am ok with decisions like those
 MSmits: it's the ridiculously precise timing required
 AntiSquid: that's why you play 24/7
 reCurse: There is a whole balance around attack animation and damage for last hitting and denying in dota
 MSmits: yeah i know
 struct: I tried to play dota but the learning curve was to big, compared to league
 MSmits: i preferred heroes of the storm
 MSmits: it seems a lot more random/fun
 AntiSquid: extremely random
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: for casual game it's better i think
 AntiSquid: i remember the fun times: ping once for helpreply: "STFU YOU TOXIC SHIT"
 MSmits: toxic?
 MSmits: lol
 reCurse: Ah yes HOTS, where you get called out for being toxic whenever you dare suggest a strategy to the team
 AntiSquid: they loved the word 
 reCurse: How fast I quit that game
 MSmits: ahh I dont remember, maybe i didnt play during the toxic era
 struct: tbf I dont know any moba where there arent toxic ppl
 reCurse: Sure, it's just the complete opposite in HOTS
 AntiSquid: what league were you in MSmits&#160;? @_@
 MSmits: dont remember honestly, i just did daily quest stuff for a few weeks
 King_Coda: That scroll bug is annoying
 Murat_Eroglu: hey reCurse, do you have a github?
 reCurse: In usual moba you get toxic people on you when you don't do things right
 reCurse: In hots you get toxic people on you when you want to do things right
 reCurse: And get called toxic for it
 struct: ah lol
 MSmits: I see
 AntiSquid: "omg that noob picked x skill" "gg, let's abandon"
 reCurse: Murat_Eroglu: Yes but not using it for anything
 agysejt: Hi recurse! what was your method?
 reCurse:&#160;?
 MSmits: pretty sure he refers to contest
 MSmits: there's a post mortem agysejt
 AntiSquid: blizz games have a weird community in general, i lost count of the times people added me in hearthstone just because they lost a game and felt angry
 agysejt: BSearch or any method?
 MSmits: he used a NN with duct i believe, but read PM
 Murat_Eroglu: reCurse, where can I find your post mortems?
 MSmits: many interesting PM's 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/67">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/67</a>
 agysejt: is any PM anywhere?
 MSmits: Murat_Eroglu they are organised in threads per contest
 jacek: (not rick roll)
 agysejt: ohh thx
 Murat_Eroglu: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/u/recurse/summary">https://www.codingame.com/forum/u/recurse/summary</a>check the top replies as you said "post mortems" in prural
 agysejt: anyway grat reCurse&#160;!
 MSmits: oh nice one eulerscheZahl
 Murat_Eroglu: thank you very mucj
 Murat_Eroglu: much*
 reCurse: Yeah check jacek's link that's where I wrote my postmortem
 MSmits: eulers link is better
 agysejt: thx , i see already
 kovi: 129 hearths...
 UUolfo: is there a way to see live code variables during operation instead of displaying it as a print? 
 MSmits: pure love kovi
 eulerscheZahl: that's probably the most liked post on the entire website
 eulerscheZahl: the petition to bring back code4life had 115 last time I checked
 reCurse: :blush:
 MSmits: lol
 agysejt: what is the best c++ framework for AlphaZero (github example)&#160;?
 reCurse: I don't know of any
 reCurse: It's usually all in python
 MSmits: wait, now i am confused. Code 4 life is not on here anymore, but someone asked a code 4 life question during contest
 MSmits: was this person trolling?
 jacek: /me
 MSmits: was it you again jacek?
 kovi: yeah, shame there is no c++
 kovi: but it probably wont be cg compatbile anyway
 Dartisan: No Code4Lie is on, I am currently on it&#160;:-)
 1415495: well 90% of the fun is to do it onself (IMHO)
 kovi: ^
 eulerscheZahl: code4life is here. but there was a delay of more than 1 year between contest and multiplayer
 MSmits: ohh ok
 jacek: during coitus also?
 agysejt: yes i see many python examples
 jacek: checking out leela zero code would be the closest
 eulerscheZahl: jacek asking for moderation?
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Marchete: alphazero.jl could be a good starting point too
 Marchete: in julia
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jonathan-laurent.github.io/AlphaZero.jl/stable/">https://jonathan-laurent.github.io/AlphaZero.jl/stable/</a>
 MSmits: thats the only azero i got to work locally actually
 MSmits: the rest required versions of stuff i could not get working or a linux system
 agysejt: ohh Julia another language?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: then i started training and it said wait 20 hours
 MSmits: so...
 reCurse: The alphazero implementations on github are very unsatisfying
 reCurse: Those I found anyway
 AntiSquid: you need to specify exact versions for each python library MSmits 
 MSmits: I know AntiSquid
 MSmits: I dont have patience for that sort of stuff&#160;:(
 MSmits: I used anaconda too, supposed to make it easier
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that why we have virtualenv?
 MSmits: still stuff goes wrong
 MSmits: yeah i did that
 MSmits: only got the julia one to work
 Marchete: python code is usually hard to run
 Marchete: incompatible versions
 Marchete: esp. old tensorflow examples
 reCurse: Especially if it depends on tensorflow, good luck
 reCurse: lol
 Marchete: :D
 MSmits: i guess when you're a pro coder you're used to dealing with all this compatibility crap, but I dont really have the patience&#160;:)
 reCurse: Tensorflow versioning is a clusterfuck
 jacek: why do they deprecate stuff
 Marchete: I totally agree
 eulerscheZahl: i hated that tensorflow task on CG
 AntiSquid: well if you run on windows 10 you sometimes need to figure out how to manually install specific libs yourself and in which folder to add ... lots of time spent on config, reason to use linux instead
 eulerscheZahl: solved the puzzle by digging through older versions of the docs in git history and just copy-pasting that
 agysejt: super&#160;:-D
 MSmits: well you used what you're good at
 MSmits: finding stuff that wasnt intended to be found :P
 jacek: huh
 kovi: i was lazy and used workspaces on udacity or on colaband keras wherever possible
 agysejt: is something caffe c++ CNN library
 agysejt: udacity or on colab?
 AntiSquid: still have aws credits i need to use up @_@
 kovi: udacity trainings...colleges who did local spent 30%+ time on environment/setup/compatibility issues
 agysejt: i see, thx, something school
 kovi: but no c++ nn
 reCurse: Oh man, reminds me
 reCurse: First day with my brand new rtx 3080
 jacek: :unamused:
 reCurse: Pytorch dies
 reCurse: No support whatsoever for it
 AntiSquid: where do you live?
 Wontonimo: nice machine
 reCurse: Had to hack around in source and building it from scratch to get it to work with latest cuda
 reCurse: Fun day...
 agysejt: when will decrease rtx price?&#160;:-D
 AntiSquid: when the assembly line runs at full capacity again
 reCurse: We can start by coming up with a plan to kill all cryptos
 Wontonimo: and demand dries up
 reCurse: I'm willing to dedicate time for it
 jacek: all hope in musk
 agysejt: Musk&#160;:-D
 kovi: and altcoins drop a bit more
 AntiSquid: crypto's here to stay 
 AntiSquid: very long term
 jacek: i heard eth's mining will be over soon?
 Wontonimo: we just need one quantum computing breakthrough and then mine all remaining coin in 0.012 sec
 Wontonimo: then it's over
 jacek: breakthrough :thinking:
 MSmits: heh, by definition, will that not just cause more mining?
 MSmits: it will just devaluate the coin
 MSmits: oh you mean literally mine everything?
 MSmits: not sure what the algo's are, but isn't it like prime numbers where you can go on forever?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html">http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html</a>
 jacek: btc supply is limited
 agysejt: it is green method&#160;:-D
 reCurse: I'm hoping regulation is how it's gonna get killed
 reCurse: China had the right idea :P
 MSmits: probably is less green than using a computer agysejt :P
 kovi: gree: are you sure? considering the power input of people?
 MSmits: ^
 AntiSquid: CCP isn't the ideal gov
 reCurse: That's not what I said
 agysejt: too many paper and pencil?&#160;:-D
 MSmits: they can still have good ideas
 MSmits: even if they're genocidal
 AntiSquid: and you'll probably get state run crypto at some point
 MSmits: on the side
 jacek: like china's chia
 reCurse: Chia is a joke I think
 jacek: which uses storage as PoW :thinking:
 reCurse: Wouldn't be surprised if it's hard drive suppliers trying to create a demand
 agysejt: anyway bitcoin or similar things totally are negative products
 MSmits: agreed
 MSmits: unless there is some entertainment purpose to them
 jacek: at least it should be based on folding@home PoW or similar
 jacek: some useful PoW
 MSmits: pow?
 jacek: proof of work
 eulerscheZahl: potw
 MSmits: ah ok, i only knew prisoner of war
 reCurse: It's just an unregulated instrument of speculation
 reCurse: The moment governments start responding to it I assume is when it starts dying
 MSmits: people just don't understand you can't create value out of nothing. Every piece of profit created with bitcoin is someone else's loss
 taha-lyousfi:  wassup guys&#160;!I am recording a video do you wanna say something to viewers&#160;??
 LeviathanProgramming: Interesting.  I did not know about the bitcoin thing, MSmits
 Marchete: from the sun
 Marchete: you can create from the sun
 LeviathanProgramming: light is created from the sun
 LeviathanProgramming: as well as heat and radiation
 taha-lyousfi:  wassup guys&#160;!I am recording a video do you wanna say something to viewers&#160;??
 jacek: MSmits tell that to feds printing moneyz
 taha-lyousfi: hey 
 taha-lyousfi:  wassup guys&#160;!I am recording a video do you wanna say something to viewers&#160;??
 jacek: meow!
 MSmits: woof
 1415495: money creation is necessary, it's only when in excess that is dangerous
 MSmits: thats the unregulated part
 MSmits: (with bitcoin)
 1415495: bitcoin doesn't create money in itself
 MSmits: how do you mean
 MSmits: it's used as money
 1415495: only states (directly or delegated) can
 1415495: that's not the same thing
 MSmits: it's not the same no
 1415495: the US/EU does create money from thin air (directly or by allowing banks)
 1415495: bitcoin creation create no extra money in itself
 MSmits: when it's mined, more of it is in circulation no?
 1415495: people gives a value to bitcoin but that's all
 MSmits: ahh of course but in a sense thats true for "real" money as well
 1415495: they are no 'new' euro/dollar in existance whena bitcoin is created
 MSmits: it's just backed up better
 MSmits: but countries have suffered hyperinflation
 1415495: not exactly when, a new dollar is created, it exists (you had N dollars, now N+1) but when a bitcoin is created N dollar dosn't changes
 MSmits: like in world wars
 BlackDereker: clash of code should have a mode for the most optimal code
 BlackDereker: that would be neat
 Bashar: i got a question
 Bashar: is it possible to find the original string from list of subsequences made from that original string?
 MSmits: eh, thats a weird question
 MSmits: are the sub(strings?) ordered in some way
 MSmits: i mean does every character exist no more than 1 time in this list?
 MSmits: in the string i mean
 MSmits: that way youcan start with a character and append or prepend characters, by going through the list
 Bashar: all original string's characters are distinct.each string in the list is a Subsequence of length 3 of the original string
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: this sounds like a clash
 MSmits: take the first item in the list as a base
 MSmits: go to the next item, see if any character is the same, add stuff to the end of this character if it isnt already there
 MSmits: keep going through the list, adding stuff and prepending stuff, till your string doesnt change anymore
 MSmits: that should give you an idea on how to solve it I guess
 MSmits: it's not an easy clash tbh.
 MSmits: if it is one
 Bashar: its not a clash
 Bashar: its a question made by someone ik locally
 struct: tesla roadster 0-100km/h in 1.1 sec o.o
 Bashar: i will try thanks man
 MSmits: np
 struct: Seems like a bit too fast imo
 LeviathanProgramming: wow, that's crazy speed
 sixengamsz: yeah is clash
 MSmits: crazy acceleration
 jacek: 3*vel?
 MSmits: speed is meh
 struct: max speed is over 400kmh MSmits
 MSmits: oh ok thats better
 MSmits: but can it fly?
 MSmits: other things that go that speed can fly
 struct: with spaceX package
 MSmits: so...
 AAlbertini: Hi everyone, I just joined Codeingame &amp; I'm trying the Temperatures exercise in Kotlin but it doesn't matter whatever I try my submit doesn't pass any test even for the empty temperatures array just return 0 nothing works but when I manually try the input from the validators it works. Is there an issue with kotlin&#160;? Thanks for your help&#160;!
 sixengamsz: xd
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: have you tried other language?
 MSmits: doubt there is an issue with kotlin, but i cant help you with that language
 jacek: someone complained about kotlin today
 MSmits: oh
 AAlbertini: I passed it in C# &amp; C++
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: weird
 MSmits: dont know any kotlin masters here
 jacek: hmm compiling takes unsually long in kotlin
 jacek: AAlbertini what do you mean by return 0?
 LeviathanProgramming: javascript and python are really fast
 LeviathanProgramming: typescript is super slow
 AAlbertini: @jacek Well I created a computeClosestToZero returning an int and did a println in the main to display the output and even if I let it empty and just print 0 the "Displays 0 if no temperature" validator doesn't work either 
 reCurse: There's issues with Kotlin CG is working to fix it, last I heard
 jacek: when i hardcode print it works for me anyway
 jacek: there is only println, no return
 reCurse: Something with compilation speed so I assume the more code the worst
 AAlbertini: Oh ok thanks because it's for a test interview with Codingame (android dev) and I tried from the tutorial window with this exercise and retried on the original codeingame to see if there is a difference but failing in any case
 reCurse: I have no idea about how things are on the "for work" side
 jacek: they recently switched compiler for kotlin (in other words - kompiler) which is slower, but i dont know any more details
 AAlbertini: Well it's just a simplified IDE with questions and exercises 
 AAlbertini: Yeah noticed kotlin is really slow. Thanks for the help anyway&#160;! 
 Bashar: @MSmits based on what should i prepend stuff?
 MSmits: ok say you're looking at one of the substrings
 MSmits: the third character
 Bashar: can i dm you the code?
 Bashar: my code
 MSmits: and its the same as the first character of your string
 MSmits: that means you can prepend the 1st and 2nd character of your substring to the string you're building
 MSmits: i suck at reading other people's code, especially if it is a different language
 MSmits: you're basically just matching substrings to the string you're building. the part you already have, you ignore. The stuff you dont have, you prepend and/or append
 MSmits: and you keep doing that until you did a full loop through your list of substrings without prepending or appending
 MSmits: then everything in there is in the full string
 MSmits: i would just loop over a substring like this:

 Bashar: this is what i wrote 
 MSmits: yeah thats not much yet, but hear me out, maybe this helps
 MSmits: maybe we should go to pm
 Bashar: okay

 Wontonimo: taco
 jacek: tacocat is a palindrome
 Wontonimo: palindrome isn't unfortunately
 ThiernoBarry1: 0.0
 Smelty: Aibohphobia is the fear of palindromes
 Smelty: coincidentally, Aibohphobia is also a palindrome
 jacek: and Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is fear of long words
 Smelty: yes
 Wontonimo: i was just going to say
 Wontonimo: had to google the spelling, but u b faster
 Wontonimo: "smiles" is a longer word though
 Smelty: Papaphobia is fear of the pope
 Wontonimo: cuz there is a mile between every s
 Wontonimo: lol

 Smelty: yes 
 Wontonimo: whatever
 Smelty: *gives wonton a box full of tacos*

 Astrobytes: I take a day or 2 away and this is what happens to the chat?
 Smelty: :0]
 Smelty: h-hi a-astro
 Astrobytes: Fix your crap messages Smelty
 Wontonimo: help us please
 Smelty: s-sorry
 Wontonimo: we are in a loop.
 Wontonimo: what's a good topic Astrobyte
 Astrobytes: Chat's on acid?
 Smelty: meow
 jacek: happy Caturday's eve
 Smelty: oop meant yes
 Astrobytes: likewise jacek
 Astrobytes: Good topic - don't ask me, I'm leaving again in a minute
 Wontonimo: i've started calling Thursday "Pre-Friday" so I don't feel bad about Pre-Friday drinking
 Astrobytes: Perhaps something about bitboards, NNs or psychedelic drugs
 Wontonimo: so, i'm not a fan of bitboards
 Astrobytes: That's how it is in Scotland Wontonimo
 Smelty: s
 Astrobytes: It's the night you ramp up your intake in prep for Friday
 Wontonimo: now, before you go and jump on that comment and praise bitboards let me be clear: They are  super useful and to their thing
 Wontonimo: I just don't look forward to coding it.
 Astrobytes: They can be annoying though
 struct: if it wasnt for bitboards I wouldnt have coded on last contest
 struct: I cant stand hex grids
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gekomad.github.io/Cinnamon/BitboardCalculator/">https://gekomad.github.io/Cinnamon/BitboardCalculator/</a>
 Wontonimo: oh, nice
 Astrobytes: I always recommend your own printing method though, with tests for everything. Write once, reuse. Or modify.
 jacek: you dont have bitboard in uttt, Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: if it got to 40k sims on move 2 without bitboard I'd be some kind of god.  No, had to do bitboard.  Absolutely
 Wontonimo: it's super useful and a must for optimization.  Just feels like work
 Astrobytes: It's good to put in work sometimes. Reward yourself with extra tacos.
 jacek: after a while writing board in classical way will feel more effort than bitboard
 Wontonimo: hopefully.  Than soon someone from work will come to my desk and ask me what the heck I just submitted to the main code base
 Wontonimo: *then
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out. See ya tomorrow or Monday-Tuesday
 struct: cya
 Astrobytes: take care all
 Wontonimo: take care
 jacek: mods are gone, lets spam :imp:

 PatrickMcGinnisII: or hd
 Smelty: F
 Smelty: it does for me too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm runnign 3 monitors, i duuno if the web 'helper' engine isn't set right or just the browser sux
 PatrickMcGinnisII: seems to be running better today than yesterday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, still slow tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gave browser higher priority, still not great
 PatrickMcGinnisII: any1 have any other suggestions, let me know

 therealbeef: wow, just the front page of that game, with the example game is making my cpu go to 30% cpu utilisation, and staying there even though the animation stopped
 therealbeef: i'll play that game in winter&#160;;-)

 AntiSquid: jacek how did you came to 30 features to use and how did you select those 30 is far more important than the number itself, you can have more than 30, not meaning to be abrupt, but the number itself says nothing .
 jacek: trial and error and experimentation. the number could be higher if there was much more benefit to have more meaningful features. but i needed to keep it low due to CG size limit
 jacek: 81 * 30 thats already 2430 inputs. if i have 32 hidden units, that gives 77.7k weights and each weight is 1 character, so that gives me around 22k for the rest of code
 jacek: which of those features are important comes from experiments. unfortunately at this points new experiment would take hours to conduct to see if it yields better results than my best net
 AntiSquid: cool, but there's a whole "area of research" on feature selection and analysis of their usefulness
 jacek: it was more handcrafted than automated :c
 AntiSquid: ah just wanted to say it's weird those guys are looking for 30, but they don't know which 30 they are looking for
 AntiSquid: whichever works best for you is good, but there are methods to go about it, you might not even need 30, i don't know
 jacek: let them roam :imp:
 jacek: for all we know i could be trolling
 Smelty: ah mind gams

 Guilherme300: I didn't know how to solve ANEO Sponsored Puzzle
 KelvinAndHubbles: since therers a 36% success rate on that puzzle, I'd bet a ton of others don't know how to aswell
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: also a heads up with that puzzle even though my solution passed all test cases it got 80% on submission. I found out that it was a rounding error and now it gets 100%

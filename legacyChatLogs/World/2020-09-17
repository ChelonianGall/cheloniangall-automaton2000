 geppoz: performance question:
 geppoz: to know the number of decimal digit in an integer
 geppoz: is faster:
 geppoz: 1) convert to string and get length
 geppoz: 2) calculate ceil(log10(n+1))

 vtenneke: does anyone have any tips on the longest palindrome puzzle? im not sorting anymore, not reversing any string, using 2 for loops but don't know how to improve or if I can...
 DomiKo: longest palindrome?
 DomiKo: can you give link?
 vtenneke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/longest-palindrome">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/longest-palindrome</a>
 vtenneke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/longest-palindrome">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/longest-palindrome</a>
 vtenneke: that ones better
 vtenneke: All solutions I see online are composed of like 3-4 nested for/while loops, mine only has 2 and still times out xD
 Moctrof: I havent done it, but maybe yyou are using functions that are doing loops without knowing it
 Moctrof: I will try to do it
 vtenneke: i think the only real expensive ones would be substring, push back and one erase.
 Moctrof: substring yeah
 Moctrof: maybe
 vtenneke: but kinda need the substring for palindrome haha
 vtenneke: hmm imma check
 Q12: How is the first place now?
 Unkmar: Okay, I will take a shot at the palindrome thing.
 Q12: *in the first place
 DomiKo: you dont really need substring
 DomiKo: and pushback
 vtenneke: How would i go storing the string without pushback or substring though?
 DomiKo: you don't need to store them
 vtenneke: go about *
 DomiKo: you can just print them
 vtenneke: ah
 vtenneke: Im gonna try that thanks
 DomiKo: no problem
 vtenneke: but there are cases where it wil find smaller palindromes first
 DomiKo: yes
 vtenneke: then how do u know not to print those
 DomiKo: i don't know
 DomiKo: but
 DomiKo: i could know
 DomiKo: if i calculated longest palindrome first 
 vtenneke: Yeah true
 vtenneke: i though mine was already doing that but it isnt
 vtenneke: so ill crunch on that for a bit
 vtenneke: thanks
 DomiKo: no problem
 DomiKo: :sweat_smile:
 DarkhShines: yo
 Scarfield: oi
 Moctrof: Well... I don't know how but it worked for me
 Moctrof: Didn't do anaything particular to improve speed and I used substring ^^
 Moctrof: C# is goat that's why probably
 Moctrof: I thought about improvment though, like if you arrive at 10 letters of the end and your longest palyndromes is 12 then you can stop
 Moctrof: And don't check for palyndromes if the word you are checking is smaller than your longest palyndrome
 mortadha: hello
 vtenneke: lol haha
 vtenneke: yeah no I already implemented all of those
 vtenneke: but c++ dont wanna be fast xD
 mortadha: XD
 vtenneke: and if i dont save them in a vector i fail at DNA medium because the first biggest palindrome it finds is TT
 mortadha: yes it's true
 vtenneke: so big sad
 vtenneke: but if C# is GOAT i might just try that xD
 mortadha: :grinning:
 Moctrof: lol
 Unkmar: Okay, so I have done the palindrome test and Taking too long in javascript at 5000 chars.
 Moctrof: Maybe you are doing something wrong
 mortadha: yes maybe you are doing something false
 vtenneke: Yeah same issue but with c++
 Unkmar: I'm not surprised at my results. I'm starting with a search for the longest and giving up when it isn't longest.  The effect has me testing every character multiple times across a sort of slider.  Certainly not optimized.
 Moctrof: So strange that I didn't have to optimize at all
 Unkmar: I might be able to improve mine dramatically by simply changing my palindrome function.
 Moctrof: I can watch your code in mp if you want and give you a hint if I have one
 mortadha: yes it's a good idea
 Unkmar: I don't know what mp is but... I'm good for now. I like challenge.
 Unkmar: I already have a good idea how to optimize my function.
 mortadha: as you like
 Moctrof: private message so I guess it's pm. I am not english native speaker ^^
 Moctrof: Yeah good luck&#160;! vetenneke same for you if you want help I can watch

 Elsa_Polindo: q pasa gilesqls
 MSmits: hi guys
 MSmits: I have a c++ question. I am always running up against the fact that the standard library unordered map/set are much slower than other implementations. Is there anyway to get a better one into your bot without running up against codesize issues? 
 MSmits: this for example:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://martin.ankerl.com/2019/04/01/hashmap-benchmarks-04-05-result-RandomFindString_1000000/">https://martin.ankerl.com/2019/04/01/hashmap-benchmarks-04-05-result-RandomFindString_1000000/</a>
 MSmits: this robin hood thing for example... way too much code
 Hjax: thats an interesting question, im too much of a C++ noob to offer any advice D: 
 MSmits: well I'm pretty much a noob also, when it comes to general c++ knowledge
 Hjax: if it were me id probably be thinking about alternative data structures, if you only need the set to do membership tests you could use a bloom filter 
 MSmits: nah I use it for transpositions
 MSmits: so i need the value
 MSmits: either I use a set with a property that is the value or a map
 MSmits: i'll have a look at bloom filter, never heard of that
 Hjax: its a probablistic data structure 
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Hjax: basically you define a hashing function, to add to the structure you | the current number to it 
 Hjax: a number is probably in the set if all bits from the hashing function are high in the bloom filter
 Hjax: (but not guaranteed due to collisions) 
 Hjax: and definitely not in the set if at least one bit is low 
 MSmits: I see
 Hjax: upside: its super fast, and with enough bits the odds of a false positive are low 
 Hjax: downside: you cant remove from the set, false positives as possible
 Hjax: are* 
 Hjax: but you are guaranteed that a false negative is impossible 
 DomiKo: you can easily upgrade unordered_map
 DomiKo: sometimes like 2x in time
 DomiKo: first use reserve
 DomiKo: second you can change load factor
 MSmits: yeah I did that before
 MSmits: but it's still a rather weak hashmap compared to other implementations
 MSmits: which surprises me
 MSmits: it shouldn't be so slow that other implementations are 3x faster. Then there's something wrong
 DomiKo: can we use PBDS here?
 MSmits: no idea
 DomiKo: yes we can
 DomiKo: nice
 DomiKo: sooo
 YurkovAS: if distinct keys not many (&lt; 1-100k), then you may change keys to ints ids and store data in static array. This fast if you switch to int keys. For keys use map&lt;string, int&gt; and auto increment in creation.
 DomiKo: you can use map and set from PBDS
 MSmits: are these better DomiKo?
 DomiKo: yes
 Hjax: distinct keys probably quite large for a TT entry
 DomiKo: and they offer a lot of features
 MSmits: YurkovAS I sometimes have millions 
 MSmits: DomiKo I dont need many features though, usually I just have a struct or something I want to hash
 Hjax: now im musing how chess engines implement their tt
 MSmits: often just a struct of two or three uint64_t
 Hjax: time to check stockfish 
 Hjax: stockfish uses a flat array
 DomiKo: I'm just saying
 DomiKo: they are a little bit hard to use
 Hjax: and indexes into it based on the key for the position, with some logic to handle collisions 
 Hjax: probably much faster than any hashmap 
 MSmits: mmh not sure that wil lhelp me with my dots and boxes solver
 Hjax: surely you have some memory constraint, so the hashmap cant grow forever either
 MSmits: memory is not the bottleneck really
 MSmits: but reserve and load would help. I may need to figure out what works best
 Hjax: then allocate a huge flat array and index into it by key
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: whats the difference with the way unordered map/set would do it?
 Hjax: those handle key collisions by having the entries of the array be a linked list (ew) 
 Hjax: so that multiple entries can share the same key 
 MSmits: hmm so the item is stored somewhere else
 MSmits: in a list
 MSmits: extra level of indirection
 Hjax: yes
 MSmits: though, the jump might actually be faster than spreading it out over 100 mb of data
 Hjax: maps go: take a key, find the right bucket with the key, find the right entry in the bucket
 MSmits: cache efficiency
 MSmits: yeah ok, but i still might get collisions
 MSmits: even if the flat array is huge
 Hjax: and if you do, you treat it like it wasnt in the table at all 
 MSmits: I was just gonna say that. That's pretty smart
 MSmits: if it isn't likely to happen, you dont lose much
 Hjax: yeah exactly
 MSmits: you do have to always do an equality check dont you?
 MSmits: which you dont with an unordered map
 MSmits: it only checks if there are more than 1 item
 Hjax: i think it still has to do the check though 
 Hjax: it at least has to check how many items there are 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but if there's 1 item, it doesnt need to check for equality
 MSmits: because the hash guarantees it then
 MSmits: hmm now I am not sure
 MSmits: so I guess I would need to make sure the hash is spread out nicely over the huge array
 Hjax: you would have to do that yes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3815f2ab-7275-49cb-bec5-26419b97b15e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3815f2ab-7275-49cb-bec5-26419b97b15e</a>
 Hjax: if im going to continue with the chess engine approach, their solution to that is zorbist hashing 
 Hjax: zobrist*
 MSmits: i have two uint64_t's now, one is xorshifted
 MSmits: inline uint64_t xorshift(uint64_t x) { x ^= x &gt;&gt; 12; x ^= x &lt;&lt; 25; x ^= x &gt;&gt; 27; return x * 0x2545F4914F6CDD1D; }
 MSmits: not sure if this will do the trick
 irishcoder: Cr3aHal0 Mind sharing your code?
 Hjax: oh you are just using your state as the seed into a prng? 
 Hjax: to get a hash?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: two things
 MSmits: a map and a bunch of object counts 
 MSmits: both are a uint64_t
 Hjax: are you familiar with zobrist hashing? 
 MSmits: map as in, a 2D map fit inside the uint64_T
 MSmits: yeah somewhat
 MSmits: from what I know, it works in cases where the order of actions doesnt matter
 MSmits: but in this case it does
 Hjax: hmm? 
 MSmits: so i cant make a progressive hash
 MSmits: well i can, but i will get collisions is what i mean
 MSmits: same actions in different order means different state
 Hjax: oh because of captures? 
 MSmits: similar to that
 Hjax: the owner of the square in d&amp;b is whoever placed the last line, but you cant infer that just by knowing where the lines are
 MSmits: no, this is more complicated
 MSmits: i make a graph
 xx.mxrilyn.xx: .
 MSmits: and strings are removed from it
 MSmits: which forces other strings to merge
 MSmits: into new strings
 MSmits: the length of those strings is affected by the order
 Hjax: youve just gone too deep into d&amp;b theory for me to keep up lol 
 MSmits: so think of it as a hash formed from a graph
 MSmits: yeah, I think I might need a few hrs to explain what I am doing
 Hjax: lol
 MSmits: it's going quite well though
 MSmits: about 150 ms for 1000 solved endgames
 Hjax: nice
 MSmits: problem is, the spread in times
 MSmits: if i try a million seeds, one of them will be 150 ms all on its own
 MSmits: just very rare
 MSmits: I kinda want to make them fast enough that even the slowest seeded map will be below 100 ms when solved
 MSmits: so currently, one map will take maybe 50 microseconds and the other 3000 times longer
 Hjax: i see you unbroke your kutulu btw
 MSmits: yeah i just removed one line
 MSmits: it's still my contest bot really, nothing else changed
 Hjax: meanwhile im trying to get legend without writing a search, its going poorly 
 MSmits: I was very stressed out about writing a search for that
 DomiKo: kutulu is so ........
 MSmits: it's very hard because of it being simultaneous and also 4p
 Hjax: but you can up with smitsimax
 Marchete: MSmits, hi, can you give me some examples of your endgames?
 Hjax: came*
 MSmits: Marchete sure, I can find a slow one or a fast one or both?
 MSmits: right Hjax
 MSmits: it could be much better than it is currently
 MSmits: I only eval sanity
 MSmits: if you put in distance related features, it could be better
 Scarfield: oh yea, saw your PM, thought you came up with that for CSB
 Hjax: the fact you are ranked so high with a super simple eval 
 MSmits: nah, kutulu was first
 Hjax: is a testament to how effective your search is in this game
 Marchete: both
 MSmits: yeah it is, i got tunnel vision which made me scared to try anything else
 MSmits: kk will try it now Marchete
 Marchete: I have some kind of unordered_map
 Marchete: I haven't tested it on D&amp;B
 Marchete: maybe you want it
 Laminator: Dude Clash of code has gotten really hard ngl
 MSmits: Marchete yes please&#160;:)
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/78c755a8-ba99-46fd-85ce-9d76105c499a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/78c755a8-ba99-46fd-85ce-9d76105c499a</a>
 Marchete: chunk is for splitting a huge vector on smaller parts
 Marchete: because it's a new() array
 jacek: :scream:
 Marchete: chunk=1 it's a simple array
 Marchete: UM_CACHE_SIZE size of your unordered_map, it never increases, it just replace stuff
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d66a4939-3478-41a3-a860-2a2dee37ab4b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d66a4939-3478-41a3-a860-2a2dee37ab4b</a>
 Marchete: you can have another version with a fast clear()
 MSmits: slowest one out of 100k seeds, takes my solver 85 ms
 Marchete: by adding a version id to the hashes
 Hjax: thats some very pretty ascii art 
 MSmits: but its complex right?
 Marchete: so in your endgames you never have a box with only 1 side, isn't it?
 MSmits: the splits have them
 Hjax: that picture has a box with only one side
 Hjax: near bottom right 
 MSmits: some even have 0 sides
 Marchete: these are my endgames right now
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d88f0ee4-29d0-4b37-8060-bfeafd53ddd9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d88f0ee4-29d0-4b37-8060-bfeafd53ddd9</a>
 Marchete: how?
 Marchete: how do you have 0? that means some score, no?
 Hjax: middle column, second row 
 Hjax: has 0
 Marchete: as you see, my print is completely the opposite
 MSmits: no i mean 0 sides filled in
 MSmits: no lines drawn on this box
 MSmits: all of these end games are completely blank, no boxes taken, only lines filled
 MSmits: so they are the most complex they can be
 Marchete: I mean the opposite lol, all 4 sides placed
 MSmits: no i dont have captured boxes
 Marchete: sorry I use the graph and not sides
 Marchete: but these endgames are nowhere similar to those in papers
 MSmits: my endgames are earlier
 MSmits: and much more complex
 MSmits: might be at ply 40-45 even
 MSmits: if there are a lot of splits
 MSmits: the papers are usually meant for 5x5 or smaller
 MSmits: they dont have many splits
 MSmits: and frankly, they seem to ignore them, because they are hard to deal with
 NikkiRedfox: .
 MSmits: these are loony endgames though, because anywhere you try to put a line, you offer boxes
 xx.mxrilyn.xx: .
 MSmits: there is no safe line to play
 Hjax: ive got to say, the stuff you guys do with board games has got to be one of the most niche hobbies ive ever encountered 
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: lemme find a fast one Marchete
 Hjax: i might be able to be competitive if we got chess as a multi
 Hjax: but things like d&amp;b are too much for me 
 Marchete: how's your endgame solver tackling it?
 leojean890: chess would be fun:)
 MSmits: the exact method has several steps including two different negamax algorithms
 Marchete: so some search
 Marchete: not an static method
 MSmits: I run one to establish which player ends up in control and then i run negamax again with different behaviors for both players
 MSmits: if you know you cant get control you make different choices
 MSmits: yeah its a search
 Marchete: :S
 Marchete: then it's not much different from the rest of the simulation
 Marchete: I mean I thought theorems and stuff would help more
 MSmits: I came up with some new stuff I didnt find in papers
 MSmits: for dealing with short strings
 MSmits: short isolated chains are easy
 MSmits: but when they are part of a network it's not easy at all
 Marchete: I thought about partition the game
 Marchete: like trying to make some patterns
 MSmits: what kind of patterns
 Marchete: like halving the board
 Marchete: making a big loop
 Marchete: to remove possible edges
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9911b3c8-2b52-482d-948a-af05a9a23167">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9911b3c8-2b52-482d-948a-af05a9a23167</a>
 MSmits: this one's fast
 MSmits: it has only 1 split
 MSmits: long chain connected to 6-loop
 Marchete: yeah, seems easier
 MSmits: basically
 MSmits: the algorithm stops as soon as all splits are gone
 MSmits: it heuristically calculates the rest
 MSmits: this I got from the papers
 MSmits: so the negamax doesnt need to play all chains and loops
 Marchete: pick good edges, cut, rinse and repeat...
 Marchete: a lot of time in some endgames
 MSmits: also, a thing I have discovered. you can *always* leave all long isolated chains (4+) for last
 MSmits: so they give no branching at all!
 MSmits: doesnt matter what else is on the map
 Marchete: long isolated like X-2-2-2-2-2-2-X?
 MSmits: yeah, no connections to anything
 MSmits: grounded on both sides
 MSmits: to the edge
 MSmits: also true for loops &gt;= 8
 MSmits: you do need to factor in 4 and 6 loops
 MSmits: they are sometimes better offered earlier
 MSmits: the reason why it's not useful to offer big loops and long chains earlier is that they are always a loss for you
 MSmits: it's not gonna cause the other guy to give up control
 MSmits: so why bother
 Marchete: well, any doubledeal chain
 MSmits: a 4 length double deal is a net 0 to keep control
 MSmits: and a 8 loop double deal also
 MSmits: thats why the limit is placed there
 MSmits: there's no gain to playing them earlier 
 MSmits: and they are isolated, so they affect no other structures on the map
 MSmits: if you play a connected string (to a split) you do affect the map, because it merges other strings together
 Marchete: I'm still on the endgame generation
 MSmits: btw, I always test these heuristics on at least 1000 maps to see if any of the negamax values are different
 Marchete: I think I'll tackle the endgame solver soon
 MSmits: sometimes 10k or 100k if its a weird heuristic and i dont believe my result
 Marchete: but I think I need to start with simple stuff
 MSmits: yeah you do
 Marchete: like only 1 or 2 box-3
 MSmits: i did the simple endgames first
 MSmits: the ones with no splits, but that's only 0,3%  of loony endgames&#160;:(
 Marchete: I'm seeing it
 MSmits: 2 and 3 splits are most common
 MSmits: but 12 splits also exist
 Marchete: I have some endgames with a chain of 48 boxes and a small of 1 box
 MSmits: chain meaning an isolated one?
 MSmits: no splits?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: I mean
 MSmits: that would be so easy to solve :P
 Marchete: a chain that can't cut anything without giving a box
 Marchete: so a lot of 3-boxes
 MSmits: 3?
 MSmits: isn't that 2?
 MSmits: i mean if it's a chain according to the papers then all boxes in it will have 2 sides filled
 MSmits: a split will have 1 side filled or 0
 MSmits: depending on whether it is connected to 3 or 4 strings
 MSmits: (or loopy stuff)
 ArthurMorgan: can anyone have any tips for code of kutulu&#160;?
 MSmits: it really depends on what your knowledge level is on search algorithms
 MSmits: it's not an easy game to search beyond the basic pathfinding algo's
 MSmits: heuristics can work. A ton of if/else scenarios
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d7494c47-463a-42d0-acdb-b7e99958492e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d7494c47-463a-42d0-acdb-b7e99958492e</a>
 Marchete: I mean like these
 Marchete: 1 huge chain
 MSmits: hmm you call that a chain, but that's confusing
 MSmits: you mean it's a huge object with many splits
 Marchete: and you can't cut without giving a box
 MSmits: a chain is actually more of a long snakey thing with no splits, following the papers that is
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats how i define my endgames
 MSmits: you cant cut without giving a box
 Marchete: then that's an endgame
 MSmits: this one would take long to solve probably
 MSmits: maybe still under 100 ms
 MSmits: but long
 MSmits: has 7 splits i think?
 MSmits: yeah 7 boxes &gt; 2
 MSmits: I have seen ones with 12
 MSmits: it's not necessarily always slower when it has more splits though, 4-way splits are also much worse than 3-way splits
 MSmits: because 3-way splits can be resolved in 3 ways, by playing any one of the strings
 MSmits: but 4-way splits can be resolved in 4 * 3 = 12 ways
 Marchete: do you filter equivalent moves in some way?
 MSmits: many ways
 Marchete: i.e. I know loops are only 1 move
 MSmits: transposition tables for one
 MSmits: loops are one move yes, but i disallow completely the move of a string + loop
 MSmits: only the string first
 MSmits: then the loop
 Marchete: string + loop tyes
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: daisy chain for me
 MSmits: because if you do the loop first, you give away everything
 Marchete: effective chain of loop is the whole chain
 Marchete: effective length*
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: and effective length of the string it's just that string
 MSmits: so i just have an "is allowed" function
 MSmits: it checks many things
 MSmits: like
 MSmits: for grounded long stringds
 Marchete: and it doesn't matter where to cuton the string 
 MSmits: I always pick the shortest grounded long string
 Marchete: so you keep track of chains?
 Marchete: or are still on a big edge bitmap?
 MSmits: for isolated objects i only count them
 MSmits: I count 3 chains, 4 loops and 6 loops
 MSmits: and long chains and long loops
 Marchete: I keep track a lot of stuff on each
 MSmits: i dont care about their length
 Marchete: I have an edge hash and a "graph hash"
 MSmits: I have a map hash and a hash for isolated object counts
 MSmits: the graph itself is not hashed
 MSmits: not necessary because the connections dont change
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/i6PHY2x">https://imgur.com/a/i6PHY2x</a>
 MSmits: any box that is played, disappears
 Marchete: mine is about reusing states
 MSmits: yeah i try that with transpositions
 Marchete: I tried simple stuff, like loops moved or rotated
 Marchete: it works
 Marchete: but I haven't fully tested on a lot of weird stuff
 MSmits: oh yeah thats why for simple objects i only count them, then it doesnt matter where they are
 MSmits: but the complex ones with splits, i dunno how to do that
 Marchete: I just count a lot of stuff, but probably not enough
 MSmits: i just have a uint64_t map which shows which parts of the objects are still up
 MSmits: and which are dead/captured
 Marchete: boxes by number of sides, grounded boxes, etc
 Marchete: I hope it's enough
 MSmits: let me give you my state function
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1fd3d46c-62f5-4ce2-8a88-4da477a4a268">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1fd3d46c-62f5-4ce2-8a88-4da477a4a268</a>
 MSmits: type is for upperbound/lowerbound/exact for TTT
 MSmits: TT
 MSmits: (not tic tac toe)
 sDCrAZzE: oop
 sDCrAZzE: TT
 Marchete: I'm using <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://create.stephan-brumme.com/xxhash/">https://create.stephan-brumme.com/xxhash/</a>
 MSmits: the counts are global which is why they dont enter the function are params, ugly i know
 Marchete: for graph hash
 Marchete: I just push some bytes and get some hash value
 MSmits: yeah I should do something like that
 MSmits: my way is really just the first thing i tried a long time ago
 MSmits: what I found though, stuff like what hash you use or similar is negligible to the power of a single heuristic
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/00388d6a-2186-4a40-8621-90968445fba1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/00388d6a-2186-4a40-8621-90968445fba1</a>
 MSmits: a pruning heuristic i mean
 Marchete: the more "bytes" explaining the thing, the better
 MSmits: yeah less collisions
 MSmits: btw, I can give you another pruning heuristic that proved extremely worthwhile
 MSmits: say you're the player that's going to be in control when all short chains and strings are done.
 MSmits: then there is absolutely no reason to play anything other than short chains and short strings until they are all gone
 MSmits: the other player has a different agenda though
 MSmits: he knows he's not in control, so he's gonna try to manipulate the splits to create as many chains and strings as he can, because the controlling player loses 2 boxes on every double deal
 MSmits: this is why i have a separate negamax just to figure out who is the eventual controlling player
 Marchete: how "fast" do you cut? I have like 100k cuts per 90ms it seems
 Marchete: no other thing
 Marchete: just cut and calculate stuff
 MSmits: hmm i dont cut individual boxes, i cut links off splits. Let me do a check how fast
 MSmits: disconnected: 33155153total time in microseconds: 11052339
 MSmits: thats 27k per 90 ms
 MSmits: however
 MSmits: when i cut a string, a lot of stuff happens
 MSmits: and I possibly do a few loops over arrays to find out if the cut is even allowed
 MSmits: very heavy pruning
 Marchete: ok
 MSmits: like, is this string grounded, connected to a split with another string that is shorter and also grounded
 MSmits: if so, then dont cut 
 MSmits: cut the shorter one first
 MSmits: unless the shorter one is a short string ( &lt;= 2) and the longer one isnt
 MSmits: you can see it gets pretty complicated  very quickly
 Marchete: I just have some basic 3-way detection
 Marchete: once the thing has more than that I just say "complex!" and move on...
 Marchete: :S
 MSmits: small part of code from my pruning:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e34e3a66-ec9d-415c-890c-c01aea1698eb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e34e3a66-ec9d-415c-890c-c01aea1698eb</a>
 MSmits: it's basically all meant to have some kind of fixed order to playing the strings in a complex object that does not affect the outcome
 MSmits: to reduce branching
 Marchete: ShortestGroundedLongStringWithNoShortAndNoDouble :rofl:
 Marchete: are you german?
 MSmits: many ideas didnt work. I would do 1000 maps and it would work for 997 maps and 3 would be an exception
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: yeah i ran out of distinct names for functions
 MSmits: so i thought screw it
 MSmits: i'll just do the whole description
 MSmits: btw, when i talk about strings, in my code these are called links so as not to confuse the compiler
 Astrobytes: lol, perhaps a shorter function name and a comment with a description would be better&#160;;)
 MSmits: maybe&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You're definitely going deep on this one, this chat is like reading a paper
 Marchete: better (FTFY)
 Marchete: most pàpers are sh*t
 Marchete: like 3x5 or stupid stuff
 Astrobytes: Yeah, fair point Marchete
 Marchete: I have like 70KB without even a solver...
 MSmits: yeah Astrobytes I am pretty sure the current state of my solver is more advanced than anything in the papers I have read
 MSmits: but not happy with it
 MSmits: also it will take a lot work to put it into a bot
 MSmits: currently it just solves the value of the game, thats not the same as picking a move
 Astrobytes: I have confidence in you
 MSmits: and dealing with people doing stupid moves
 Marchete: stupid moves break good bots :D
 MSmits: sometimes yeah&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Either way, you have amassed a whole lot of valuable knowledge
 MSmits: not sure if it's valuable, but sure, to D&amp;B enthousiasts
 MSmits: to publish it, I would also have to do some heavy math, because often I kind of intuitively know a heuristic will work and then i test it on 1000+ maps and it produces no error, but thats not a mathematical proof
 Astrobytes: Team up with aCat, maybe you can do a presentation at a virtual game playing AI conference
 Astrobytes: Yeah sure, the maths would be most of the work most likely
 MSmits: i dont know if you've looked at the papers on this, but the math is extremely verbose and messy
 Astrobytes: I've seen some yeah
 Astrobytes: Didn't read much if I'm honest!
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236661788_Playing_simple_loony_dots_and_boxes_endgames_optimally">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236661788_Playing_simple_loony_dots_and_boxes_endgames_optimally</a>
 MSmits: thats the most useful one to me
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've seen that one
 Astrobytes: I haven't delved into the game enough yet for any to be useful to me at the moment
 MSmits: there are two levels to reading this
 MSmits: 1 is to just take the rules for granted and apply them
 MSmits: which is mostly what i did
 Hjax: the d&amp;b discussion passed my level of comprehension an hour or two ago @Astrobytes
 MSmits: 2 is to read and check the proofs... thats horribly difficult
 Astrobytes: Yes agreed MSmits, I get that a lot with these kinds of papers. Some are reasonably easy to follow, some are like this
 Astrobytes: lol Hjax, how's your Kutulu?
 Hjax: i didnt work on it at all last night 
 Hjax: i started writing a slasher predictor, except when i uploaded it, it got 4th 15 times in a row :D 
 Hjax: and i havent looked as to why its broken yet 
 MSmits: 4th legend?
 Astrobytes: lol, oh dear
 Astrobytes: last place 4th
 Hjax: ^
 MSmits: whats that
 MSmits: last place 4th?
 Astrobytes: first to die
 Hjax: i know losing is unfamiliar to you 
 Astrobytes: Kutulu
 MSmits: ohhh
 Hjax: but if you do really poorly 
 MSmits: sorry :P
 Hjax: you get last
 AntiSquid: what's the point of that weird wording when he could explain it in stupidly simple words?
 Hjax: :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 AntiSquid: in the paper you linked
 MSmits: the proof
 MSmits: the rules are simple to follow
 MSmits: but it's science, so they need to mathematically prove the rules
 MSmits: which is not at all interesting from a bot programmer standpoint
 AntiSquid: no i mean i don't see the point, it's like he wanted to add that abstract notation to make the paper look like it means much more than it does
 Hjax: the weird thing was my slasher tracker was printing the right things to stderr
 MSmits: hmm maybe, I didn't look at the proofs closely enough to know if they could have been written more simply
 Hjax: probably just incorporated it into my scoring wrong 
 MSmits: I remember the pain of the slasher
 Hjax: my bot is just wildly inconsistent 
 Hjax: sometimes it will get 1st in a lobby with the boss and the top 2 bots 
 Hjax: sometimes it will get last with a lobby of a bunch of rank 150 gold bots
 MSmits: the game is also unpredictable
 MSmits: a guy can screw you over by taking an unexpected turn and leaving you behind
 MSmits: so you and he are both solo and the other 2 are together
 MSmits: = you are 3rd and 4th
 AntiSquid: teamkiller
 Marchete: yeah, that happens a lot
 Hjax: i frequently have that problem even if all 4 explorers are together 
 Hjax: 3 go one way, i go the other 
 Astrobytes: And there are a fair few non-deterministic ones out there too, just to muddy your waters a bit more
 MSmits: happens to me as well
 MSmits: mine is non deterministic I think
 MSmits: not sure
 Hjax: you do some random rollouts at the start
 Hjax: im sure that is enough to bias between a few good options 
 AntiSquid: didn't the wanderers have some random? that's how i remember it
 Hjax: they break ties randomly 
 Marchete: the first game with smitsimax, right?
 MSmits: is it really random? Or in some weird order? 
 MSmits: yeah, it's a poorly implemented version
 Astrobytes: No that's the turning directions
 MSmits: with a 1 property eval and ofc, in C#, with very few sims
 Astrobytes: The tiebreaking for targets is random
 Hjax: if theres 2 equidistant explorers, and the wanderer wasnt chasing either of them last frame
 Hjax: it will break the tie randomly 
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i didnt even do that random thing in my sim i think
 MSmits: i think i assumed it would follow me
 Hjax: "me" being the explorer running the sim?
 Hjax: or "me" being always MSmits
 AntiSquid: being MSmits running from wanderers irl
 Hjax: lol
 Astrobytes: Ah that's what he does when he goes out for his walks
 Hjax: oh i guess you only have one sim
 MSmits: lol
 Hjax: i wonder if its better to give each explorer a slightly different sim 
 Hjax: biased against them 
 MSmits: yeah I had one sim with 4 search trees
 MSmits: and i now remember why its nondeterministic
 MSmits: it does the first 10 choices of each node randomly
 Hjax: yeah 
 MSmits: so as not to get some weird resonance between the explorers
 MSmits: all go right, all go left etc.
 Hjax: your post mortem said if you didnt do that sometimes youd get stuck in a horrible local optima 
 Hjax: where everyone does bad moves
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's kinda necessary
 MSmits: happened in csb too
 MSmits: when i forgot about that
 Astrobytes: It's in your Smitsimax playground
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: been a while since i wrote that
 MSmits: but I also didnt use the algo much, because of all the board games
 Astrobytes: Still interesting nonetheless
 MSmits: yeah, really I came up with it because I didn't know what else to do for 4p simultaneous
 MSmits: it's just to have something to search even if it's horribly flawed. Something is better than nothing
 MSmits: for a game like that, everyone makes some messed up algo
 Hjax: i like smitsimax way more than minimax for code of kutulu
 Hjax: the idea that everyone is out to get you isnt very realistic, the idea that everyone is self interested is very realistic 
 MSmits: yeah, but mostly because, how would you even do minimax?
 Astrobytes: Well, it certainly has its uses, so not that flawed or messed up
 MSmits: simultaneous minimax is already hard
 MSmits: and then it's also 4p
 Hjax: the people that did minimax (like agade) just assumed everyone was out to get them 
 Hjax: and optimized against the worst case 
 GuillaumeRicou: Hi guys&#160;! What do you think about PHP&#160;?
 Astrobytes: aka Paranoid
 MSmits: yeah i meant flawed/messed up compared to how neat those 2p boardgame searches are
 Astrobytes: ah right
 Hjax: im honestly surprised the paranoia search works for kutulu
 Astrobytes: Yeah same
 Astrobytes: But, it did
 MSmits: same, you actually need eachother
 Hjax: it seems like it would always guess the wrong opponent moves 
 Hjax: but apparently it works
 AntiSquid: fits with the theme (paranoia)
 Hjax: doesnt makes sense to me personally 
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: He had Kutulu on his side during the contest eh
 Hjax: kutulu isnt on my side
 Hjax: need to go sacrifice a lamb 
 Astrobytes: hahaha

 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: did you watch the boys yet
 MSmits: on amazon?
 MSmits: it has an aquaman
 MSmits: pretty cool show
 Astrobytes: Currently finishing off Orange is the New Black final series
 MSmits: ahh ok, never watched that
 Astrobytes: Watch it, brilliant show
 MSmits: i like the boys because almost every superhero is a jackass or totally evil
 Astrobytes: Yeah you mentioned it before, think it's on my list
 MSmits: far more realistic than all that marvel stuff
 Hjax: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only watches anime
 Hjax: :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Marchete: yeah, the boys season 1 was awesome
 Fireballl: *only watches anime as well so can relate*
 MSmits: just watch the opening scene of the boys. Just the first scene and you're immediately hooked
 MSmits: so grisly
 Marchete: indeed
 Marchete: first season was a blast, I saw it some time ago
 MSmits: saw it recently
 Marchete: the first 2 chapters of season 2 are meh
 AntiSquid: MSmits i was the one that recommended you the boys actually maybe you forgot and watched because someone else recommended?
 Astrobytes: How many seasons so far?
 MSmits: no, sorry AntiSquid I did forget you recommended it, but I found it just by YT advertisement
 MSmits: however, thanks for recommending it, you were right :P
 MSmits: this is also how i found CG
 Astrobytes: adverts on youtube?
 MSmits: someone recommended it and then 2 yrs later i found it by googl
 derjack: i could recommend certain cartoon
 MSmits: then i told the guy i found CG and it was like dude, i told you this 2 yrs ago
 AntiSquid: then MSmits did you at least watch "Watchmen"&#160;? kinda similar idea sort of but different heroes and different goal 
 MSmits: yeah i watched the movie 3 times
 Astrobytes: derjack :o
 MSmits: series partly
 MSmits: not derjack, he's not active
 MSmits: he just tried it when cg was new and left
 AntiSquid: i didn't like the series, dropped after few episodes, is the Watchment series good?
 MSmits: RL friend
 Astrobytes: no MSmits, I'm replying to derjack/jacek
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's ok i guess
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: nothing close to the boys
 MSmits: the boys is epic
 AntiSquid: i watched latest episodes from season 2
 MSmits: I like stormfront
 MSmits: otherwise some storylines are less interesting, but still good show
 Astrobytes: The neo-nazi website stormfront or another TV series? :P
 MSmits: she is a neonazi basically in the show
 MSmits: so both?
 Astrobytes: Haven't heard of the show
 AntiSquid: checked reddit about the boys, regarding stormfront people seem personally offended, i don't get it it's an actual nazi with nazi reference in the name&#160;:/
 MSmits: thats because the show is brilliant
 MSmits: they make you feel she's a feminist
 MSmits: and then she does some :poop:
 MSmits: and some people cant take that
 AntiSquid: nah i thought she's nazi from the start because of the name
 MSmits: ah i didnt realize that
 Astrobytes: That's why I mentioned the website, that should be the clue
 MSmits: anyway gtg to the store before it closes
 AntiSquid: MSmits&#160;: Stormfront is a white nationalist,[3] white supremacist,[4] antisemitic, Holocaust-denialist,[5][6][7] and neo-Nazi[8] Internet forum, and the Web's first major racial hate site.[9] In addition to its promotion of Holocaust denial, Stormfront has increasingly become active in the propagation of Islamophobia. 
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yeah, i realize that now
 MSmits: not so versed in the nazi stuff
 MSmits: good thing i guess&#160;?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It's been around forever that site
 Astrobytes: like 20+ years anyway
 AntiSquid: general knowledge, whatever you know might be useful
 MSmits: ttyl&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: or not
 MSmits: yeah agree
 MSmits: thanks
 Astrobytes: laters
 AntiSquid: bye
 AntiSquid: wait astro thought you watched the boys already
 AntiSquid: it's at season 2 episode 5 airs tomorrow
 AntiSquid: (i watch on amazon)
 Astrobytes: Nah, added it to my list
 Astrobytes: Cool, will try and check it out soon
 starmaq: I assume there is no way to set a filter for public clash of codes?
 starmaq: like if I only want reverse mode,
 irishcoder: ugh these captchas
 irishcoder: :angry:
 irishcoder: and starmaq no there isnt unfortunately 
 Astrobytes: You can do that if you create private clashes
 Astrobytes: And choose a language iirc
 starmaq: I see irish, thanks
 starmaq: yeah astro I can, but that's not public and filling it up with people would be a delay each time
 Astrobytes: Yeah, only works if you have a bunch of people willing to join already I guess
 Astrobytes: There's a #clash channel though starmaq, mostly for joining but you can always post a private clash there
 starmaq: good idea actually
 Astrobytes: It's not well-publicised though
 starmaq: I will try that thanks
 Astrobytes: But is getting more popular since it's quite recent
 Astrobytes: There's a few bots that pick up clashers from twitch and such, then link to it in there
 jacek: and clash is apparently more popular since the quest map
 Astrobytes: Yeah, though even a month or so before it was really getting hugely popular for some reason
 starmaq: tbh I'm mainly here for clash of code, what do you guys usually do here
 jacek: multiplayer bot programming
 Astrobytes: Multis:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 starmaq: oo
 starmaq: I will check that out
 Astrobytes: Sometimes puzzles:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 Astrobytes: And yeah, check it out. A lot of people never see it and miss out
 irishcoder: they look harder than the clashes 
 Astrobytes: Bit more time and effort required for the bot programming sure, puzzles a bit less for the most part
 AntiSquid: they have leagues and you start off with a very easy version of the game
 AntiSquid: and i am still surprised most people do clashes here, the main part of the site is the multi section 
 AntiSquid: you can do clashes an puzzles on many other sites too so ya
 Astrobytes: I know, so many people don't even notice it
 AntiSquid: how many quit before even touching the multi section?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I've often wondered about that
 AntiSquid: when i first joined i looked at the multis same way i look at ROS (robot operating system) now though confused and thinking it's harder than it looks
 Astrobytes: All I noticed back in 2015 was the puzzle stuff, sites changed a bit in that time mind you
 AntiSquid: tron 2014, maybe the layout doesn't direct people to where it should
 AntiSquid: main page doesn't get the add-ons it needs
 Astrobytes: When I got active again it was Code Royal contest so just got into  the bot stuff after that
 Astrobytes: *Royale
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it should be more obvious I think
 Astrobytes: I mean ofc clash is 'Compete' but... it's not really in the same category as the rest of the 'Compete' section
 mortadha: hi
 Astrobytes: hello
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Jello  . always room for jello
 Astrobytes: oh hey Patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: U do Eulers bender 4?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: anyone?
 Astrobytes: Nope. Been on my todo since... a while
 AntiSquid: not ye
 AntiSquid: t
 AntiSquid: stuck with reading books, maybe it makes me smarter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I've rewritten my bot twice, still won't solve 20x20 without running out of memory
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rewriting again
 Astrobytes: You've to compress the path in Bender 4 right?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: since everyone hates php, I'll cheat...7-segment scanner
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3c78f9c-dc53-476d-a532-d7bb42ed02c5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3c78f9c-dc53-476d-a532-d7bb42ed02c5</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the compression is kinda secondary to the pathfinder, but yes
 AntiSquid: lol
 Hjax: i still find it amusing that most of the (presumably) best clashers on this site 
 Hjax: dont play clash at all
 Hjax: because multis are far more interesting 
 Astrobytes: Some also don't like the short time because they're slower coders, or got fed up with repetition 
 Astrobytes: And the quality issue
 Hjax: i played enough to get pretty high ranked and then just quit forever
 Hjax: it gets boring pretty fast imo
 Astrobytes: I played a few back in the day and got bored. And also got followed by so many people that I just stopped
 Zenoscave: ^ this.
 AntiSquid: fangirls
 Zenoscave: I was ranked 2nd at one point. it just isn't the same as a good multi
 Hjax: you made it further than i did, i think i peaked at like rank 200
 Hjax: most of my losses were reverse puzzles 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The new adventure quest map thing on the homepage kinda makes u play it...i still don't have the patience to play 50 clashes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, multis all the way. And I like a good puzzle now and then
 Astrobytes: I am happy with not completing the clash part of my quest map
 Astrobytes: Just need the contribution part
 AntiSquid: how do i even check highest clash rank?
 Zenoscave: api calls probably
 Astrobytes: Was thinking about Morpion Solitaire as an optim
 Astrobytes: (aka join 5)
 Zenoscave: morpion solitaire?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: anyone have link to the leaderboard thing someone made?
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_Five">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_Five</a>
 Zenoscave: just found it, thankyou Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the optimization path is impossible for php
 Astrobytes: Could work as either multi or optim
 Astrobytes: Or both
 Zenoscave: do both
 Astrobytes: Just need to find the time&#160;:/
 bhupesh21: yo
 bhupesh21: im in java 2 but i would like to get better at coding any suggestions?
 bhupesh21: ive been playing these games but I feel like im not with the kids in my class skill wise
 AntiSquid: java 2&#160;?
 bhupesh21: yea in college
 AntiSquid: ah that's just your college standardization of courses ... 
 AntiSquid: (i guess)
 bhupesh21: yea
 bhupesh21: i feel like other colleges around me are way past us in coding'
 AntiSquid: ya so what do you want to do / use java for?
 bhupesh21: we started off 1st semester java with blockcode-_-
 bhupesh21: well, i want to be a computer engineer
 AntiSquid: ok one sec 
 bhupesh21: but my goal is to get at a way better level of java than rn
 bhupesh21: i have the book but im more of a visual learner&#160;:/
 Hjax: the only way to improve is to write lots of code 
 Hjax: imo
 bhupesh21: and my teacher is booboo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Intro to Java by D. Liang is pretty good
 Hjax: ive never been one for programming books personally 
 bhupesh21: exactky
 bhupesh21: i have starting out w java by tony gaddis
 bhupesh21: but its so big and i dont wanna read it. i wanna code and get better practicing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a pretty healthy book collection, I admit - most are junk... but there are tidbits here and there you just aren't gonna find on the internet
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FKnight/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/FKnight/videos</a> this guy has a computer science full course on his github, guess it's worth checking out bhupesh21
 bhupesh21: plus like i said im a visual learner and out teacher this semester has a really heavy accent and our class can barely understand him
 Hjax: id say just pick any game from the bot programming section and go for it 
 Astrobytes: I'm oldskool, I like books :PBut yeah, practice. Learn a concept and practice the hell out of it
 Hjax: whenever you arent sure how to do something, look it up 
 AntiSquid: also you could just search on github for java courses and keep improving, i doubt colleges teach you everything so learning on the side helps
 Hjax: and use what you learn in your program 
 Astrobytes: ^
 bhupesh21: okay! thank you all
 bhupesh21: and i will def be checking his yt out
 Astrobytes: Oh, and - don't give up
 Hjax: thats how ive learned every programming language i know, just the cycle of "i want to do x" "look up x" "use x" repeat
 bhupesh21: thanks&#160;:)
 bhupesh21: @hjax wdym
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Can You program triggers in java on CG?
 bhupesh21: ohh x as in what ur searching for haha
 Hjax: like, pick something you want to make 
 Hjax: whenever you get stuck while working on it 
 Hjax: look up how to do the thing you want to do 
 AntiSquid: apply your knowledge by solving problems&#160;? bhupesh21
 TheBattleTravellerEater_ff82: hi
 bhupesh21: yup
 bhupesh21: i will thank you all.
 bhupesh21: i feel like the most important thing ive learned is that its stressful but yea not to give up.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i use alot of triggers, i didn't think CG would allow that
 AntiSquid: so do a multi in java bhupesh21, not sure why else you joined the site any multi
 bhupesh21: i have
 bhupesh21: i just got done w the descent
 AntiSquid: no
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Hjax: ^ these are multis
 Astrobytes: The Descent is a puzzle
 AntiSquid: that only requires a for loop
 bhupesh21: ohh okay
 bhupesh21: are the multis way more helpful?
 Hjax: yes
 AntiSquid: challenging more like it
 Hjax: because they are open ended problems 
 Astrobytes: Can be, for sure. 
 Hjax: you have to learn new things to solve them 
 bhupesh21: bet :D
 TheBattleTravellerEater_ff82: elaaroussiayoub1@gmail.com
 Hjax:&#160;?
 bhupesh21: u guys on discord?
 Astrobytes: They're not easy, but it's a great opportunity to learn bhupesh21
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tron or Obapa are pretty easy to get started
 AntiSquid: you can click discord button at the top if you want bhupesh21
 Astrobytes: Are you on the CG discord bhupesh21?
 bhupesh21: no, im asking u guys
 bhupesh21: are u guys in it?
 bhupesh21: so i can join 
 Hjax: i am
 AntiSquid: i just told you .
 Astrobytes: Yep
 bhupesh21: kk
 AntiSquid: k
 AntiSquid: to make it awkward
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 bhupesh21: lmao
 bhupesh21: so more than likely
 bhupesh21: if i get all these games done on multi
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oqpiaj0IUM&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oqpiaj0IUM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
 bhupesh21: my coding will improve a hell of a lot. 
 Hjax: @bhupesh21 the thing about multis is they are competitive games, your program plays against other programs 
 Hjax: and goes on a leaderboard
 bhupesh21: i see
 Hjax: so theres a lot of strategy and creativity too 
 bhupesh21: it doesnt matter what i start off w right?
 Hjax: pick one that sounds approachable and looks fun
 bhupesh21: or is it categorized from easy to hard
 Astrobytes: Nope
 bhupesh21: bet
 Astrobytes: Though a lot of the board games are harder than they look
 Hjax: personally i think ghost in the cell is a fun beginner game
 Uljahn: Coders Strike Back has a tutorial
 Astrobytes: even PR2
 Hjax: pr2 is also a fun beginner game (platinum rift 2)
 AntiSquid: same for BotG
 Astrobytes: But, it's subjective as always
 Astrobytes: Yeah, BotG might be the one for you too
 Astrobytes: Try a few out and get a feel for how they work, ask questions if you have to
 Hjax: botg is one of the games i havent even looked at lol 
 Astrobytes: I don't like it (personally) but I still recommend people try it
 Hjax: the rank 1 guy seems to be absurdly dominant 
 bhupesh21: where is bot g
 Astrobytes: And I'll get around to writing a proper bot for it one day

 bhupesh21: thank you 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Toonify, kewl
 AntiSquid: the #1 gave a massive, i mean really long text of feedback how to rebalance the game, but i amnot sure about some of the stuff he said
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn it's in python, shouldda known
 AntiSquid: that was 2 years ago
 Hjax: well he clearly knows something everyone else doesnt 
 Hjax: because thats a massive points lead
 AntiSquid: maybe but he also said melee heroes are still stronger but nobody uses them correctly or he wouldn't be first, not sure about this though
 AntiSquid: i am worried we made ranged heroes suddenly more powerful through one tiny change, but then decided we don't change anything until we get some activity on the game ... but then CG is very quiet outside contests&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: BotG 2
 AntiSquid: lazy
 Hjax: unofficial contest
 Hjax: gogo
 AntiSquid: what's the current sdk version&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Toonify, wow 9 days on a 16GB GPU to train your own...20 minutes an image therafter, holy crap
 Ollie4040312: i do not use code i use blocks like a noob:disappointed:
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid 3.13 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine</a>
 Ollie4040312: i have never learned them or practiced them
 AntiSquid: bunch of obsolete / outdated packages it seems . 
 AntiSquid: when i try to setup locally i mean it won't work, not sure what i do wrong, XR still works
 AntiSquid: sdk changed a bit since then, wonder how CG keeps all old game up to date so easily without docker containers
 AntiSquid: want to do a new multi anyway, don't like the art in botg .
 AntiSquid: one day ...
 Ollie4040312: can someone teach me what this means!!!???
 JBM: not much
 Ollie4040312: such advanced technology!
 Ollie4040312: i am dumb because i use block commands
 Ollie4040312: and i do not know how this means
 JBM: neither do thou
 AntiSquid: "this" 
 Ollie4040312: oh
 AntiSquid: be specific and it's then possible to help you somehow
 Ollie4040312: i do not understand what the coding language is
 Ollie4040312: like what console,log(enemy2); I DUZNT UNDERSTAND!
 Unkmar: that is javascript.
 Unkmar: console.log() is like print() for most langaugesl.
 Unkmar: I'm loving the vim editor style.  It is passable.
 mortadha: wa kammoun
 Uljahn: please use english here
 JavaScriptCoder: I have a questiono
 JavaScriptCoder: question*
 AntiSquid: ok thanks for letting us know
 JavaScriptCoder: it says to add a end at the end of my script but theirs already a end
 JavaScriptCoder: then when i added a end the script glitched
 mortadha: i don't understand your question
 JavaScriptCoder: ok i just experiment.
 hfazal018: can someone help me with python
 hfazal018: it is the horse racing duel
 x544D: there is no assembly :p&#160;?
 Lisker_the_slow: someone come 1v1
 Unkmar: JavaScriptCoder: Please give the exact message it gives?
 x544D: there is no Assembly included in CG&#160;?
 ChrisChrisLoLo: assembly is bad
 MadKnight: i heard someone tried smitsi in tron
 midomawk: Hello guys any python guy here
 Bassel: I am
 midomawk: i have a question about my code because im new to python
 midomawk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cfcd31aa-8856-44d3-b5dc-51206cf99f9d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cfcd31aa-8856-44d3-b5dc-51206cf99f9d</a>
 Justin123: Can you give an example of the input? Is it just a single line string like "stufufuf;anothercommand;things"
 midomawk: echo "hello;word";pwd;
 Justin123: if so you can split by&#160;; by doing s.split(';')
 Justin123: which gives you array of stuff in between
 midomawk: i cant because echo "hello;world"
 midomawk: is a command
 midomawk: maybe there is a way to replace a char within two quotes&#160;? with a negative ascii code&#160;?
 midomawk: the way idk
 Justin123: so what would you want to do in the case the&#160;; comes between ""
 Bassel: Are commands guaranteed to be correct?
 midomawk: i did pass through the string like the c way if i find " i skip it until the next quote
 Bassel: Also
 Bassel: is this a valid command
 midomawk: i will test the commands later if there is correct or not i have just to get a list of commands
 Bassel: echo "hello \"&#160;;\" world"
 midomawk: yes its correct
 midomawk: if i haveecho "hello&#160;; world"; pwd;i should get ["hello&#160;; world", "pwd"]
 midomawk: sorry ["echo hello;world", "pwd"]
 midomawk: my script is working just im looking for a better way because im not a python guy that's way
 Justin123: its not supposed to be ["echo "hello;world"","pwd"]?
 midomawk: yeah sure
 midomawk: just for the example i forgot it
 Bassel: hmmm
 Bassel: You can split by ';' and iterate all commands, if one of them is missing closing double quotes, merge it with the next one with&#160;; in between 
 midomawk: yeah a good solution also
 midomawk: yeah sure thanks bassel
 midomawk: thanks to justin also 
 Bassel: You're welcome 
 Justin123: re.split(<b>;(?=(?:[^'"]|'[^']*'|"[^"]*")*$)</b>, data)
 Justin123: no credit to me, found online
 midomawk: thank you man ;D
 Justin123: np, basically it just uses regex and lookahead&#160;? to make sure any&#160;; it finds isn't between quotes

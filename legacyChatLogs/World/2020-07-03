 Alex-Galaxy: A good wording for a puzzle would be short and to the point, while it may be a good challenge to code like LelouchVC2 said it has a bit too much wording to it
 MarlynMatematico: yep
 Crypticsy: noted, i am going to reduce the descriptions  to my limit. 
 Crypticsy: hey, so i reduced as well as try to simply it. Can you have a look again?
 Crypticsy: tried*
 POWERHAWK: I wish i had friends that knew how to code&#160;:(
 Crypticsy: you got us&#160;;)
 jacek: but were not friends o.O
 Uljahn: we are participants of the community, being friends is not necessary for giving an advice or answering a question about coding
 AntiSquid: no more clash invites Automaton2000&#160;!!
 Automaton2000: at least as far as i know
 LeBaoHoang8A4: NO WAY!
 Acman: 8 characters off L/
 Acman:&#160;:/
 TrongLeDanh: so hard
 Acman: damn just found a way to cut 11 chars from a sln and it was so obvious haha
 Acman: wouldve won damn
 LelouchVC2: Automaton
 LelouchVC2: Automaton2000 gay
 Automaton2000: im not sure if its clear what i mean :p
 LelouchVC2: Automaton2000 are you a bot?
 Automaton2000: and how far are you from&#160;?
 jacek: thats a sin to not cut out chars from sin
 hovanhoa: hello
 WINWINWIN: No more clash invites? How do you do that?
 thienok: Add new to HashSet it is already to be sorted but i dont want it have been sorted so how can i to do iy
 BlackPillow: Hey there
 WINWINWIN: Hi
 LeuLeu: =)0 wow
 BlackPillow: :apple:
 tomatoes: hashsets not for sorting
 pardouin: AHAH when a guy first with 268 chars in CoC shortest mode doesn't share his solution like "wanna keep my secrets&#160;:&gt;" and you submit a 146 chars solution after him &lt;3
 pardouin: made my day
 LelouchVC2: You may be overthinking it
 pardouin: maybe&#160;:)
 Daher: PARDOUIN stop dreaming
 Daher: you delire
 Astrobytes: Nice improvement tomatoes&#160;:+1:
 Raghuveer:&#160;:)
 Raghuveer: :thumbsup_tone1:
 Raghuveer: :4
 tomatoes: many crashes :grinning:
 WenjieShan: ok
 N0_nAme: yoi
 Washier: yes, got excited earlier when i beat tomatoes in the IDE a few times, then the new bot whipped my beehind
 Washier: i wanted to ask, is it ok/polite to post a game replay here?
 ZarthaxX: yes
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: also, isnt rust in debug mode in ide?
 Washier: jacek, your bot smashes me hard everytime. 
 jacek: :innocent:
 struct: Hello
 no39mz: hi
 Hjax: hi everyone :D
 MrDoom: Hey&#160;:-)
 jacek: moshi moshi
 Harphazi: hello
 spata: are you coding son?
 Ashraful: I'm stuck at CODERS STRIKE BACK at bronze league. What can I do?
 MostComplicatedUsername: -3vel
 MostComplicatedUsername: :D
 MostComplicatedUsername: print (f"{targetX-3*velX} {targetY-3*velY} {throttle}")
 MostComplicatedUsername: That help?
 DarkMan: Hello, guys. I am new. Is there any games except for "5min", in which I can make a private lobby?
 Hjax: i think i almost have my rust bot working
 MostComplicatedUsername: imagine not using python
 Hjax: imagine using python 
 Hjax: theres a lot of games you are doomed to suck at if you are using python 
 MostComplicatedUsername: hmmmmm
 Hjax: in any search heavy game 
 Hjax: youll be hugely disadvantaged due to the performance of C++ 
 heavygabriel: wow
 heavygabriel: so I spent like 3 hours
 heavygabriel: for a solution that needed 5 lines of code
 MostComplicatedUsername: well
 MostComplicatedUsername: idk
 Astrobytes: Did you learn something along the way?
 heavygabriel: yeah
 Astrobytes: Time well spent then.
 heavygabriel: that you can just instead of like saving all data
 heavygabriel: just save the one that you need
 Astrobytes: Good lesson
 heavygabriel: tbh could help
 heavygabriel: I'm relatively new to programming(few years hobbyst)
 Desjardins: well the other day it took me around 30min to figure out which was wrong with myArray.lenght
 heavygabriel: array.length
 heavygabriel: tbh I like more lists
 Desjardins: yep
 heavygabriel: since they're less a pain for instances and stuff
 Hjax: dbdr you around?
 heavygabriel: most of my programs uses lists
 heavygabriel: since there's so much stuff you can do with it compared to arrays
 Desjardins: well using js arrays arent much of a pain
 heavygabriel: C# makes it so you have to define the length of your array
 heavygabriel: lists are like JS arrays
 heavygabriel: you don't need to define them
 heavygabriel: like how big they are
 Desjardins: yeah i know. i used to avoid classic arrays in c# too
 Desjardins: but these days i rarely even use c#
 heavygabriel: tbh c# is my savior
 heavygabriel: because I'd go and make a website that'll take like 10 hours for the UI
 heavygabriel: instead of none with C#(provided you make console apps)
 Desjardins: its a great language. and theres visual studio. But since im using arch, c# is not very usable
 heavygabriel: IK that for ubuntu it works
 heavygabriel: (even arm64 .NET core since I sometimes use a chromebook to code, send help)
 heavygabriel: btw I think I like this site
 Desjardins: xDmy main problem is that desktop stuff like wpf and stuff doesnt run
 heavygabriel: can't you use wine for that?
 Zackslay: is there somewhere where i can learn this stuff
 Desjardins: never tried it but it should work
 Desjardins: but it isnt a very clean solution
 Astrobytes: 2 bottles should do the trick&#160;;)
 heavygabriel: yeah but either that or you dual boot windows
 Zackslay: what code do you recommend for beginners
 heavygabriel: what do you want to do?
 Zackslay: ummm
 Zackslay: pass one of these games
 heavygabriel: do you want to do websites and stuff or do you want to do command prompt stuff
 Zackslay: ummm
 heavygabriel: IE logic stuff or UI &amp; logic stuff
 Zackslay: websites is easier
 heavygabriel: try Javascript then
 heavygabriel: it'll help ya
 Astrobytes: This isn't the best site to learn a language Zackslay, it's good for practicing once you have the basics down
 Zackslay: will it help me with these hames
 Zackslay: idk where to learn
 heavygabriel: w3scholo
 heavygabriel: w3school*
 Desjardins: just search for a yt tutorial
 heavygabriel: nah
 Desjardins: there are many goof ones out there
 Zackslay: w3school?
 heavygabriel: here's what I learned from coding stuff: always try to do the tutorial
 heavygabriel: try adding new stuff
 heavygabriel: like IDK there's a tutorial that makes you able to show an image
 Zackslay: is w3school a website?
 heavygabriel: yes
 heavygabriel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">https://www.w3schools.com/</a>
 heavygabriel: should help you
 Zackslay: thank you
 heavygabriel: remember: always try to mess around with the code
 Desjardins: well im going afk. have a good day guys
 heavygabriel: so you can learn what you can and can't do
 Zackslay: ok
 Zackslay: i tried
 Zackslay: i cant do anything lol
 heavygabriel: it's normal
 heavygabriel: even I can't do stuff sometimes
 heavygabriel: just remember
 heavygabriel: 1. internet is your best friend
 Astrobytes: Maybe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">https://www.codecademy.com/</a>
 heavygabriel: 2. messing around with code is the best thing
 Zackslay: i tried code academy
 Zackslay: they want you to buy everything that useful
 heavygabriel: yeah I hate codeacademy
 Zackslay: ik i can learn it free somewhere
 heavygabriel: like it's way too slow
 struct: freecodecamp?
 Astrobytes: Hm. Well, plenty other tutorial sites
 heavygabriel: try w3school dude
 Zackslay: ok
 heavygabriel: play around with it
 heavygabriel: also
 Astrobytes: Search engines are your friend
 heavygabriel: install Visual Studio Code on your PC
 heavygabriel: it's better than notepad
 Astrobytes: HERESY
 heavygabriel: what? you use nano to code?
 heavygabriel: smh
 Zackslay: k
 Zackslay: im gonna go start
 Astrobytes: Nah, VS
 Astrobytes: Just trolling
 heavygabriel: btw I find it funny that codingame asks me the first time I log in "how many years of professional experience do you have in coding?" like smh does hobby time count
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about it, I don't code for a living but I have plenty hobbyist experience.
 Astrobytes: CG do interview assessments and such for companies so it's a relevant thing to ask.
 dbdr: Hijax
 Astrobytes: lol
 heavygabriel: CG?
 Astrobytes: codingame
 heavygabriel: tbh I'm thinking about coding for a living
 heavygabriel: like I'm already very passionate with code
 heavygabriel: and I'm pretty young
 heavygabriel: so why not try that?
 Astrobytes: As long as you put your mind to it and apply yourself you can do whatever you want
 heavygabriel: how old are you btw?
 Astrobytes: Just never forget that there's no shortcut or easy way, you gotta put in the work
 heavygabriel: and yes I know that.
 Astrobytes: Older than you, I am 37.
 heavygabriel: younger than my dad
 heavygabriel: lol
 heavygabriel: I'm 16 so of course you're older lol
 heavygabriel: most people will be older than me
 Astrobytes: Hey there's a lot of pretty skilled younger people on here too, as well as older
 heavygabriel: yes I know
 heavygabriel: I mean my bro's a good logical thinker
 heavygabriel: he doesn't know programming languages
 heavygabriel: but still
 heavygabriel: also let me tell you something: I actually have no idea how to do stuff on a phone
 heavygabriel: like yeah swipe right swipe left
 heavygabriel: but since I don't have a phone IDK anything else besides the basic functions
 jacek: no phone. such freedom *.*
 Astrobytes: I have a 'smartphone' for work, and a dumb phone for personal.
 Astrobytes: Blissful.
 heavygabriel: who the fuck cares about owning a smartphone
 heavygabriel: you can still like ask a stranger his phone to call someone
 heavygabriel: since everybody has a phone
 Astrobytes: Many people. You can see them all staring at them when they bump into you.
 heavygabriel: nah this isn't america
 heavygabriel: where I'm at
 Astrobytes: It's like that in the UK.
 tomatoes: my dad cant into phones without buttons, but granddad quite fine with phones and pc's 
 heavygabriel: I mean I live in quite a "small" city
 heavygabriel: in canada
 Astrobytes: I can use smartphones etc, I'm just not a fan.
 rak1507: heavygabriel, I'm younger than you&#160;;)
 heavygabriel: stop being actually 12 rak
 heavygabriel: it's bad :P
 rak1507: not quite that young
 rak1507: 12 &lt; my age &lt; 16
 heavygabriel: I hate AUTO CONVERTING TO EMOJIS
 rak1507: same here 
 heavygabriel: like bitch i want to do a tongue
 Astrobytes: don't use them then
 heavygabriel: not some cringe ass twitter emoji
 WINWINWIN: Hi Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Hey WINWINWIN
 heavygabriel: rak btw I guess you're like 13
 rak1507: nope 15
 WINWINWIN: Minimax works pretty bad for UTTT, any place to learn MCTS?
 tomatoes: tons
 WINWINWIN: What are the best ones?
 heavygabriel: wait what's UTTT and MCTS?
 rak1507: MCTS is monte carlo tree search, idk what uttt is 
 Astrobytes: Anywhere really! It's not a complicated algo really, optimising it and debugging can be a pain
 heavygabriel: oh
 heavygabriel: algorithms
 rak1507: ya
 WINWINWIN: Do similar Pruning options apply?
 Astrobytes: UTTT is Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, a bot programming multiplayer game on here
 heavygabriel: I'm still quite new to programming so I don't think I should learn about these things
 AbundantPuddle: They are rhythms created by Al Gore.
 heavygabriel: like yet
 rak1507: I guess, although they're not that complicated, and you'd learn a lot by doing it
 rak1507: always good to jump in at the deep end
 heavygabriel: it's like a lake
 heavygabriel: you plunge at the deep end and fucking die
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN not quite in the same way
 rak1507: lmao
 heavygabriel: since you were a retard and you didn't know how to swim
 heavygabriel: lel
 rak1507: the nice thing is the internet is like a life jacket
 AbundantPuddle: He has created many and a lot of people use them, especially in computing.
 AbundantPuddle: Yes, a lot of people are becoming familiar with the Al Gore Rythms.
 WINWINWIN: Probably will start with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/monte-carlo-tree-search-158a917a8baa">https://towardsdatascience.com/monte-carlo-tree-search-158a917a8baa</a> is it a decent site?
 AbundantPuddle: He also invented the internet.
 AbundantPuddle: And global warming.
 AbundantPuddle: He is a man of many talents.
 rak1507: :thinking:
 tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/">https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/</a>
 Astrobytes: It's focused on data science/ML WINWINWIN, is that what you want? 
 tomatoes: helped me in the past
 heavygabriel: who's al gore?
 AbundantPuddle: He is an American politician.
 rak1507: american politician 
 heavygabriel: oooh so that's why I never heard of him
 AbundantPuddle: And yet, I bet you use his rythms all of the time.
 Astrobytes: Nice site tomatoes, I wish I'd seen that a long time ago :D
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, thanks Astrobytes. Good night now, 1:45AM my time&#160;:)
 heavygabriel: oh my fucking god
 heavygabriel: can I kill you
 WINWINWIN: Thanks tomatoes
 Astrobytes: Goodnight WINWINWIN, take care&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 heavygabriel: abundant that's actually shittingly shit
 AbundantPuddle: Which part? It's all 110% true.
 heavygabriel: there are no words in my mind that can explain the disgust I felt from that joke
 Astrobytes: Al Gore, the Computational Drummer
 AbundantPuddle: Lmfao
 heavygabriel: what's the truthiness of Trudeau? idk
 heavygabriel: false?
 Astrobytes: But he's True-doe
 AbundantPuddle: That's true yo
 heavygabriel: n o
 AbundantPuddle: fo dho
 AbundantPuddle: sho*
 AbundantPuddle: I like how I'm correcting words that don't actually exist anyways.
 Astrobytes: gg
 heavygabriel: I know a few words that you can't translate
 AbundantPuddle: I think I may have to change my avatar now. When I get a moment, I'm just going to edit Al Gore with a drum.
 heavygabriel: osti de calis de tabarnak osti de calis de viarge
 heavygabriel: can't translate if it cannot be translated
 AbundantPuddle: Is that supposed to be French?
 Astrobytes: Québécois
 heavygabriel: yes and no
 AbundantPuddle: Quebecian
 AbundantPuddle: Like spanglish
 heavygabriel: it's like if US had its own swears
 heavygabriel: that  are religious
 jacek: bloody hell
 Astrobytes: It's so far from French that the French are offended by it
 heavygabriel: ok 
 Astrobytes: :D
 heavygabriel: if the US was colonised in 1608
 heavygabriel: and had religious swears
 heavygabriel: it would be like that
 LelouchVC2: "go to hell"
 heavygabriel: no
 LelouchVC2: *triggered*
 heavygabriel: it's like fucking asshole retard fuck you
 heavygabriel: btw what if
 heavygabriel: we used emojis
 heavygabriel: to name our vars
 heavygabriel: :flushed:
 heavygabriel: fuck you 
 heavygabriel: emoji ass
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiTBXXmU0AAzaMP.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiTBXXmU0AAzaMP.jpg</a>
 heavygabriel: yes but python is cringe
 heavygabriel: wait
 Astrobytes: That's C++
 LelouchVC2: Nah bro, that's obviously Java
 heavygabriel: oh yeah
 heavygabriel: I see a bit of C
 LelouchVC2: 🤦‍♀️ heavygabriel = True
 LelouchVC2:&#160;;
 Astrobytes: It's C++
 AbundantPuddle: You're all wrong, clearly, it's assembly.
 LelouchVC2: holy shit, I didn't notice
 LelouchVC2: To be exact, it's MIPS back 1976
 AbundantPuddle: Hahaha
 AbundantPuddle: okay cool guy {return false}
 rak1507: seen emojis used in code golf to save characters bc of their multibyte representations
 rak1507: pretty clever
 LelouchVC2: clever my ass
 LelouchVC2: its why they call me a smarty pants
 AbundantPuddle: He didn't use all of his variables in the emoji code.
 heavygabriel: wanna hear a funky thing with TS?
 heavygabriel: if you want to check your variables againts, let's say null
 heavygabriel: you couldn't do if(variable===null)
 heavygabriel: you have to declare a variable named null
 heavygabriel: and do if(variable===this.null)
 rak1507: w h a t
 rak1507: x === null seriously doesn't work?
 rak1507: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tio.run/##K6ksSC1OLsosKPn/Pye1RKEssSgzMSknVcFWIa80J8eaiys5P684PydVLyc/XQMhawuR17T@/x8A">https://tio.run/##K6ksSC1OLsosKPn/Pye1RKEssSgzMSknVcFWIa80J8eaiys5P684PydVLyc/XQMhawuR17T@/x8A</a>
 rak1507: I mean
 rak1507: I'm no typescript programmer
 rak1507: but that seems to work
 heavygabriel: WHAT
 heavygabriel: HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE
 LelouchVC2: *holds phone*
 rak1507: lol
 LelouchVC2: Its 911, wondering why u were talking with that child at the park
 heavygabriel: no
 LelouchVC2: I'll pass the message along
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2
 heavygabriel: 2 secs
 heavygabriel: wait it does work now
 heavygabriel: before it didn't
 rak1507: :thinking:
 tomatoes: wonderful js world
 rak1507: this is why js is bad
 JBM: it has its good parts
 rak1507: the best js code is no js code
 Astrobytes: All languages have their quirks, weaknesses and strengths. IF you use the right tool for the job, it won't matter
 Astrobytes: Hi JBM
 rak1507: as long as you never ever use PHP, it's all good&#160;;)
 AbundantPuddle: Quirks? Insert All Might reference here.
 Hjax: watashi ga kita 
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 Astrobytes: Oof here it comes
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/aBgyqoQ/a49nMabK_700wp_0.webp">https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/aBgyqoQ/a49nMabK_700wp_0.webp</a>
 tomatoes: but at least you got error message. better than silent things
 Astrobytes: Oooh bronies vs weebs :popcorn:
 heavygabriel: astrobytes what if I am forced to use the language in question
 Astrobytes: heavygabriel then make the most of it
 AbundantPuddle: Hahaha. A weeb would have said  "Boku No Hero Academia," and not "All Might."
 AbundantPuddle: Or just referenced him from his Japanese manga name.
 heavygabriel: like bro I cannot not use HTML for websites
 rak1507: if you're ever forced to use PHP, a bullet to the head should end your suffering
 Hjax: i said his tagline in japanese, that has to count for something 
 heavygabriel: it's not the "right tool" if it's shit
 Astrobytes: :shrug:
 heavygabriel: rak1507 I was forced to use scratch, AMA
 AbundantPuddle: This is true. Lmao.
 rak1507: lol
 heavygabriel: ok block-based coding
 JBM: ohai Astrobytes, wazza
 rak1507: the fact that scratch is the goto langauge for 'teaching' young children and not python pisses me off immensly 
 heavygabriel: scratch has eye candy
 AbundantPuddle: Furries vs Bronies vs Weebs
 heavygabriel: python doesn't
 rak1507: true
 AbundantPuddle: Coming to a theater near you this Halloween.
 Astrobytes: Everything and nothing JBM, how goes it for you?
 heavygabriel: also do you know how hard it is to switch from a functional language to OOP?
 rak1507: it's so infuriating though, for years sometimes kids have to do that crap
 heavygabriel: not that hard actually
 JBM: Astrobytes: crazy tired for reasons
 rak1507: I feel very strongly about scratch 
 heavygabriel: took me like 2 months to learn a bit of C#
 rak1507: What language did you start with?
 heavygabriel: uh TS/JS
 rak1507: It's pretty rare to start with a functional language
 heavygabriel: HTML/CSS
 JBM: completed 2 of my personal deadline thingies, 2 to go
 rak1507: TS isn't functional
 heavygabriel: I started coding in sites
 heavygabriel: YES IT IS
 heavygabriel: wait
 Astrobytes: JBM: All progress is good progress
 JBM: it's not pretty either, but who cares?
 JBM: sure
 rak1507: it's not purely functional, but it is kinda
 JBM: the optimistic view
 Astrobytes: Hey I'm a natural pessimist, I'm trying hard here
 JBM: nicely done then
 tomatoes: logo
 heavygabriel: it's functional and OOP
 tomatoes: or some ripoff
 JBM: like lisp
 heavygabriel: wtf is lisop
 heavygabriel: lisp*
 rak1507: lol
 Astrobytes: ()
 rak1507: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)</a>
 heavygabriel: WOQW
 JBM: lisp is an acceptable logo
 heavygabriel: 1st version: 1958
 heavygabriel: gg
 JBM: for those who never noticed
 heavygabriel: lisp? sorry I only know pascal, the only programming language
 rak1507: smh anything other than pure lambda calc is too abstracted for me
 jacek: D?
 heavygabriel: wtf is lambda calc
 JBM: "an acceptable lisp"
 rak1507: hahaha
 Astrobytes: gg
 heavygabriel: sorry but I'm in high school
 heavygabriel: haven't passed it
 JBM: not sure the relevance?
 rak1507: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus
 heavygabriel: half life has calculus?
 heavygabriel: poggers
 rak1507: lol
 Hjax: struct i hope youre happy now 
 heavygabriel: can't pass high school if you're not senior
 heavygabriel: smh
 tomatoes: 😀
 tomatoes: no java allowed
 heavygabriel: also is it me or is the inbuilt IDE here is code OSS?
 tomatoes: vs code
 Astrobytes: Nice Hjax, fully functioning Rust bot. Bring on the pwnage
 Hjax: its only a bit faster than the java version 
 heavygabriel: no
 Hjax: and its eval still sucks 
 heavygabriel: VSC is based on code OSS
 heavygabriel: but with a few tweaks
 Astrobytes: It's Monaco
 Hjax: 25% speed improvement cant save bad eval 
 heavygabriel: but code OSS is MIT licensed
 jacek: 25% more speed over java?
 Hjax: roughly 
 Hjax: yeah 
 heavygabriel: who cares about perf
 Astrobytes: Alright heavygabriel, submit a python bot in Othello and lets see how you do
 heavygabriel: sure! let me learn python
 heavygabriel: and in 2 years I'll fill ya in
 tomatoes: i tried to add more things in eval, but it got worse
 Astrobytes: Fine, use JS
 tomatoes: maybe wrong weights
 Astrobytes: Probably tomatoes
 Astrobytes: Also, game phase
 struct: Nice Hjax
 heavygabriel: yeah but you've been programming for like atleast 200% more than me
 struct: 25% seems a bit low though
 heavygabriel: more time*
 Hjax: the whole bot is bit math, im not sure how much speedup to expect 
 jacek: isnt computer about all math
 tomatoes: valgrind it
 Hjax: i should install linux for rust development 
 rak1507: if it's about math do it in fortran&#160;;)
 struct: cant you wsl?
 tomatoes: i heard that rust better works in wsl
 tomatoes: than plain windows
 Hjax: random win against jacek
 Hjax: nice
 jacek: :F
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.gyazo.com/57ba1d413d16f7e61294f6360c77087a.png">https://i.gyazo.com/57ba1d413d16f7e61294f6360c77087a.png</a> this is how long everything takes in java 
 jacek: youre using default Random?
 Hjax: threadlocalrandom, the faster default random 
 Hjax: i tried a xorshift and it wasnt faster 
 Astrobytes: Really?
 Astrobytes: Hm
 jacek: ahh its not synchronized then?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 I haven't forgotten about Oware, I'm still coming for you
 darkhorse64: I can wait for another six months
 Astrobytes: ooooooh burn :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 darkhorse64: :stuck_out_tongue:
 Astrobytes: You're probably right tbh :D
 Hjax: you still working on othello Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: On and off Hjax yeah
 Astrobytes: Not done too much CG this week tbh
 Hjax: i was thinking, isnt it faster to just generate an array of random numbers on startup
 Hjax: and index into it 
 tomatoes: LCG is fast
 Astrobytes: Never had any issues speed-wise with a xorshift myself tbh
 Astrobytes: Anyway, painkillers in effect, catch you guys tomorrow
 LelouchVC2: why the painkillers all the time&gt;
 LelouchVC2:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I have multiple spinal fractures, possible osteoporosis with unknown cause, ongoing
 Astrobytes: Pretty bad since I'm 37
 Astrobytes: Anyway, goodnight
 tomatoes: goodnight

 DialFrost: same
 DialFrost: anybody?
 Wontonimo: no ruby here
 DialFrost:&#160;:(
 Mortis_666: what problem is it tho
 DialFrost: dont panic code golf
 struct: my ruby knowledge is the basic only
 struct: and only golf stuff
 DialFrost: the problem with my code is its not printing anything
 DialFrost: wanna look at it struct?
 struct: paste it here I guess
 struct: ill take a look
 Wontonimo: I just created a markov text generation contribution ( to replace Automaton2000 )
 Automaton2000: doesn't sound easy to fix
 DialFrost: wat now?
 Wontonimo: yeah, did it in the last 2 hours
 DialFrost: thats fast
 Wontonimo: i had fun with it&#160;!  just finished watching a whole bunch of videos about making Roguelike games and a common theme was generated text
 struct: on your example one does it stop at 8?
 struct: or should we keep generating?
 Wontonimo: also, i haven't made a markov text generator before so i throught it would be fun
 Wontonimo: yeah, stop generating
 struct: why?
 Wontonimo: wait ... where are you reading 8?
 struct: Step 8&#160;: ['is','bad'] =&gt; ['and']
 Wontonimo: ah ... right.  i'll add "etc" after that!
 struct: maybe you can add ...
 Wontonimo: thanks
 struct: np
 DialFrost: struct if uk ruby doesnt it mean u know some python?
 struct: well i dont know ruby
 DialFrost: but u js helped me with ruby
 DialFrost: i can tell u know some...
 struct: well I know a bit of ruby
 DialFrost: ye
 struct: and a bit of python
 DialFrost: ah ic
 DialFrost: but ur a lot better at c++?
 struct: im only really familiar with c++
 struct: yes
 DialFrost: so u know perl too then?
 struct: no
 DialFrost: oh
 DialFrost: perl is really close to c++
 DialFrost: and rly op at code golf &lt;33
 DialFrost: u shld try it
 Wontonimo: i used perl in the past
 Wontonimo: spent about 2 years coding business applications in it
 DialFrost: sheesh
 DialFrost: thats mean ur a god at it?
 DialFrost: 2 yrs is a long time mate
 Wontonimo: that was back in 1996 and 97
 Wontonimo: so, i remember little 
 DialFrost: oh ic
 Wontonimo: does anyone use perl anymore?
 DialFrost: mostly for code golf
 DialFrost: but i dont use it
 DialFrost: although i hope to learn c++ soon
 Wontonimo: interesting
 DialFrost: so i can learn perl
 Wontonimo: yeah, c++ is good
 DialFrost: perl is god of code golf
 DialFrost: *and c++ is a really good language (fast,efficent)
 DialFrost: but can be tricky to learn sometimes
 Wontonimo: okay, but other than just for this site there is no need to golf code
 Kururugi: man this is first time i hear perl used for code golf
 Wontonimo: it can be fun, but probably not something I'd recommend spending too much effort on.  Certainly not a skill that will help you get a job 
 Kururugi: yeah
 Kururugi: code golf is bad for project dev
 Wontonimo: well, it's past midnight
 Wontonimo: actually it is 1234&#160;!
 Wontonimo: good night all
 e_fishel: 9 days till Christmas
 Wontonimo: o.m.g.  i need to shop
 e_fishel: i'm blown away by how quickly this came
 Wontonimo: and sleep
 Wontonimo: l8r
 e_fishel: cya
 e_fishel: good night
 DialFrost: sleep?
 DialFrost: lol its 1:43 pm
 DialFrost: bai anyways
 e_fishel: timezones :pensive:
 DialFrost: &lt;33

 LelouchVC2: is he old enough for that explaination?
 Urutar: I suppose
 Urutar: Not going around asking people for their age though
 Urutar: Not going around asking people if they're imbeciles either; just assuming they're not&#160;;)
 Manohar123: i am unable to find the solution
 Cederkaeppen: AoC was hard today&#160;:-)
 jacek: thats what...
 sompong665: hello
 Tien2k9: the puzzle of the week is really hard for me&#160;:(
 DialFrost: they're always hard
 Tien2k9: yeah
 Tien2k9: but it's difficultly is normal
 DialFrost: wait wat
 DialFrost: wr
 Thorcode: really
 DialFrost: wr's the link
 DialFrost: oh wait nvrm
 Tien2k9: the today puzzle of the week 
 DialFrost: bruh this difficulty is medium
 DialFrost: green valleys
 Tien2k9: that's hard
 5DN1L: difficulty is all comparatively speaking
 5DN1L: try one of the very hard puzzles, you may say it's insane
 Uljahn: solved it with a simple floodfill algorithm
 DialFrost: meh im not very good at coding
 DialFrost: didnt rly wanna solve it
 5DN1L: You'll improve with practice :wink:
 FlyingWormOfPower_efa8: hi parówa
 TheZombieKnight_2fc5: hehe
 TheZombieKnight_2fc5: no wlasnie
 Uljahn: speak english here or /join #poland
 LelouchVC2: Discrimination!
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, what is discrimination?
 Automaton2000: ok i guess i can take a few hours
 5DN1L: Only English is allowed in this channel. Only Polish is allowed in that channel. No unfair treatment. No discrimination.
 LelouchVC2: Thats what they said about segregation
 LelouchVC2: "Separate but equal"
 5DN1L: Is separate ranking for different languages in code golf discrimination?
 LelouchVC2: yes, discrimination by performance
 5DN1L: Is single ranking for all languages in clash of code short mode non-discrimination?
 5DN1L: shortest*
 LelouchVC2: im just messing with you xD
 5DN1L: me too, playing along :wink:
 LelouchVC2: :flushed:
 TheZombieKnight_2fc5: :open_mouth:
 Mortis_666: hi
 Mortis_666: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what does that mean i have to write your own Mortis_666
 5DN1L: wow
 Mortis_666: lol
 Mortis_666: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i don't feel like it
 5DN1L: First time I see Automaton2000 actually responding with the other person's name
 Automaton2000: i see you are a bot
 Mortis_666: ya
 Mortis_666: cool
 jacek: oh my
 Urutar: Automaton2000 is a neat bot, reminds me of Eliza a bit
 Automaton2000: my bot isn't good enough to get me to gold
 Urutar: Do you know Eliza, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i have to save it
 Urutar: Neat
 Urutar: What about you, AutomatonNN?
 Urutar: Aww
 5DN1L: Eliza II / Eliza Expanded
 Urutar: It's quite neat
 TheModified: Big ups to this site, got an internship starting february and it helps me brushing up my c++
 5DN1L: Great!
 TheModified: so in the horse-racing duals "assignment", apparently my sorting algorithm is too slow but i use quicksort
 TheModified: any ideas? or would the issue lie elsewhere?
 5DN1L: i used this and I passed: sort(strengths.begin(), strengths.end());
 Mortis_666: what lang is this
 5DN1L: C++
 DialFrost: got it
 TheModified: am i missing an include to use that?
 5DN1L: yeah, you need #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
 TheModified: oh thats standardized in the assignment, but i cant seem to use it
 TheModified: i assigned strengths as int strengths[n]
 5DN1L: I used a vector
 TheModified: I'm not familiar with vectors, i'll look it up!
 BlaiseEbuth: You can use it with any container, even classic array btw.
 5DN1L: I'm not familiar with C++ really :P
 5DN1L: Just describing my code which passed that puzzle
 TheModified: using quicksort i passed testcase 1 and 2, but got a timeout on 3
 5DN1L: does using sort make a difference?
 Mortis_666: im stuck at case 3 too
 TheModified: yes it did! just had to find out how to add to the end of a vector
 Mortis_666: using python
 TheModified: .push_back fixed it
 5DN1L: great
 TheModified: #TheMoreYouKnow
 osmanfrncw: how to pass mad pod racing i need help
 TheModified: Thanks a bunch, @5DN1L
 5DN1L: you're welcome
 osmanfrncw: how to pass mad pod racing i need help
 DialFrost: u can try asking the pro guys
 5DN1L: Mortis_666 let's look at your case now
 Mortis_666: ok
 osmanfrncw: I'm stuck in a section and where can I find the answer?
 DialFrost: try not to cheat osmanfrncw
 5DN1L: did you sort the inputs first? Mortis_666
 Mortis_666: yes
 Mortis_666: then check between neighbours
 5DN1L: that looks fine so far
 osmanfrncw: .
 5DN1L: you go through the list only once right, after sorting i mean
 Mortis_666: yes
 5DN1L: that shouldn't lead to a timeout
 5DN1L: what's your issue for case 3
 5DN1L: timeout?
 Mortis_666: Process has timed out. This may mean that your solution is not optimized enough to handle some cases.
 TheModified: thats exactly what i had
 5DN1L: hmmm weird
 TheModified: i guess its the way you sort
 5DN1L: i did the sort in one line
 osmanfrncw: Where can I ask the professionals, how do you pass the sections where you hang out?
 5DN1L: in the same line as reading all the inputs
 5DN1L: not sure if that makes any difference
 Mortis_666: im putting a value small to infinitethen check between neighbours in the sorted listif the diff of neighbours is smaller then small change the value small to the diffoutput small after the loop
 5DN1L: yeah, that's what i did too
 Mortis_666: hmm
 5DN1L: Do you do it with a for loop or a while loop?
 TheModified: instead of infinite, i used 1 above the max range of pi, but same difference
 Mortis_666: and i use sorted func
 Mortis_666: for loop
 5DN1L: ok
 5DN1L: i used sorted too
 5DN1L: Did you use a list comprehension?
 5DN1L: Not sure if that makes any difference though
 Mortis_666: in the getting horses part?
 5DN1L: yes
 Mortis_666: yep
 Mortis_666: wait
 Mortis_666: let me try this
 5DN1L: i mean i used a single line to read the inputs, convert them to integers and sort
 Mortis_666: yes
 Mortis_666: i do it in one line
 5DN1L: ok... that sounds really weird
 Mortis_666: aha now i solved it
 Jerrasterix: ruby&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: which puzzle&#160;????
 5DN1L: lol did you change anything? Mortis_666?
 Mortis_666: yes
 5DN1L: Jerrasterix Horse Racing Duals
 5DN1L: Mortis_666 what did you change?
 Jerrasterix: ohhh fine..
 Mortis_666: before that i use horses[horses.index(horse)+1] to find neighbours insted of enumerate
 Mortis_666: and now i use enumerate
 Mortis_666: mayb thats the problem
 5DN1L: ah i see
 Mortis_666: lol
 5DN1L: you read the list more than once each time
 5DN1L: that's why it's slower
 Mortis_666: yes
 5DN1L: good, problem solved!
 Mortis_666: yes!
 5DN1L: and learn to be more efficient in reading lists too :wink:
 Mortis_666: ig last time when i solve this puzzle idk enumerate
 Mortis_666: btw the solid integers
 5DN1L: yeah?
 Mortis_666: u say look how many solid integers are there in 1 digit, 2 digit nums
 5DN1L: yeah
 Mortis_666: but i still cant find the pattern
 Mortis_666: lol
 5DN1L: haha
 5DN1L: what's the number series you have then
 Mortis_666: i loop one by one and check it have a 0 or not XD
 5DN1L: yeah, that's fine, but how many are 1-digit, how many are 2-digit, etc?
 DialFrost: this is the most amount of ppl i've seen online so far
 Mortis_666: for 1 digit 9
 Mortis_666: for 2 digit its 81?
 5DN1L: correct
 Mortis_666: and for 3 digit there is a lot
 5DN1L: you may write a code to find out the number of 3-digit solid integers
 5DN1L: or you may just guess now
 Mortis_666: ok
 Mortis_666: wait
 Mortis_666: i think i know
 Mortis_666: 9**2 is 81
 5DN1L: bingo
 Mortis_666: wow rlly?
 Mortis_666: imma try
 5DN1L: it's basically number of combinations
 TheModified: ** is ^?
 5DN1L: how many numbers you can make without using the digit 0
 5DN1L: ** is ^ in some languages
 5DN1L: or the other way round
 TheModified: oh i've had no idea
 5DN1L: or some languages don't use either lol
 TheModified: time to finish some papers, have a good one lads
 5DN1L: you too :joy:
 Jerrasterix: A doubt, can mods read personal messages&#160;??
 DialFrost: haha
 5DN1L: what personal messages
 DialFrost: like pms
 DialFrost: from one person to another
 5DN1L: i mean between who?
 DialFrost: anybody
 DialFrost: any 2 random ppl
 5DN1L: I don't think I can read random people's personal messages
 DialFrost: hmm lol there's ur answer jerrasterix
 Jerrasterix: ohh Thanks 5DN1L
 5DN1L: at least on the chat. not sure personal messages on the forum. but i doubt it
 LelouchVC2: of course u can
 LelouchVC2: just hack
 DialFrost: lol
 Jerrasterix: bruhhh needing 711 xp to get to level 20 :sob:
 DialFrost: lol
 DialFrost: solve puzzles
 DialFrost: gives u quite some xp
 derjack: hmm
 5DN1L: or get to a higher league in a bot game
 Jerrasterix: I will have to solve 15 puzzles&#160;:(

 Jerrasterix: lol was but not now 
 Jerrasterix: no community contest 
 derjack: no more community constest now
 5DN1L: or gain some achievements
 5DN1L: solve simple puzzles in other languages
 5DN1L: easy xp gains

 Jerrasterix: nice one, thanks 5DN1L
 derjack: cg sponsored contest is language achievement fest
 rekaxem: what are exp for?
 LelouchVC2: showing off to ur friends
 5DN1L: And levelling up. At certain levels you gain additional rights.
 rekaxem: oh cool

 5DN1L: "Anyone can follow anyone, just like on Twitter. There is no way to block someone though or make your profile private."
 Urutar: Eh, apparently it's in the backlog
 Urutar: I do wonder why people have to be so toxic sometimes.
 Uljahn: following people just gives you additional filter in leaderboards
 5DN1L: ah right
 rizonbro: what is the problem
 rizonbro: any ppl that toxic on discord I log out by bot
 rizonbro: discord
 Wontonimo: also, following people allows them to private message you when you are offline 
 rizonbro: umm migth be
 rizonbro: umm migth be
 rizonbro: sorry

 KrazyCorpse: I retract my previous statements as well as my presence on here
 Mortis_666:  /join" Wass up"
 KrazyCorpse: &lt;skulks back to drawing board in shame&gt;
 5DN1L: KrazyCorpse you can do it
 White_Code: leave the commas
 KrazyCorpse: :muscle: :grimacing: hnnnnggg...
 Jerrasterix: okay I still don't know, but I went from Bronze to gold botg...
 Jerrasterix: ^int botg
 KrazyCorpse: I thought each test case is a separate exercise :face_palm_tone1:
 Mortis_666: uhh
 5DN1L: No, it isn't. And after your code succeeeds in passing all the test cases, it still has to pass all the invisible validators
 5DN1L: The validators are yet different from the test cases
 KrazyCorpse: that's the crucial piece of info that did not reach my caffeine-soaked brain today
 KrazyCorpse: cheers!
 5DN1L: You'll get used to it&#160;:)
 KrazyCorpse: :sunglasses: you betcha!
 Uljahn: KrazyCorpse: this might be useful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/inout-puzzles">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/inout-puzzles</a>
 KrazyCorpse: much obliged, @Uljahn
 balamalexis: lol
 jacek: aww
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop trolling jacek. No more mods on your side...&#160;:(
 jacek: mod strike?
 BlaiseEbuth: Resignations.
 BlaiseEbuth: Fresh mods will ban you on sight. Be careful
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: i still show as mod but not much longer
 balamalexis: who´s from Germany
 Uljahn: euler, what about your puzzle search tool? will you eventually shut it down?
 eulerscheZahl: btw topcoder marathon started yesterday <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YymAKif">https://imgur.com/a/YymAKif</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the puzzle search does a re-indexing on autostart for me
 eulerscheZahl: but it's totally possible that CG API changes, i don't know if i would fix it then
 eulerscheZahl: and i might not notice when indexing of new puzzles breaks. another cause might be that my active session cookie expires
 rekaxem: what is the puzzle search tool
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm not actively deactivating it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 jacek: any changes announced recently?
 Uljahn: ok, thanks
 rekaxem: what is this tool for
 eulerscheZahl: no, just a question on mods channel who's still in and who wants to quit. with a recommendation for those who only care about contests to choose the latter. which is what i did
 eulerscheZahl: when you play a clash of code and time is over, you can search it and keep playing without time pressure. and when you want to create a puzzle yourself, you can check for duplicates
 rekaxem: wow
 eulerscheZahl: but tbh i was just a matter of time for me to quit. CG just isn't the same website anymore as it used to be 3 years ago. different target audience now
 darkhorse64: That says a lot about future contests
 eulerscheZahl: there is no confirmation about the future. neither in one nor in the other direction
 rekaxem: who are the target audience now
 eulerscheZahl: CG used to be about AI contests, see the bot programming section. now it's more about puzzles, clashes, escape, ...
 jacek: maybe they said that so mods wont be overwhelmed during contests
 eulerscheZahl: more training, less competing
 jacek: everyone's a winner
 darkhorse64: everyone &gt;99%
 Uljahn: we are losing most competent, proficient and creative part of the community because of no bot contests, because CG staff is used to think this part is too small to be relevant, sad
 BlaiseEbuth: 5% thought Uljahn... :smirk:
 Uljahn: 95% of zero is still zero
 darkhorse64: Harsh comment
 Bon[]Crayon: :peace:
 Astrobytes: Harsh times.
 BlaiseEbuth: Not while you don't divulgate the 0. Welcome in the fantastic world of the CG surveys!
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: are you resigning also&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes I resigned with euler and Ille
 jacek: Uljahn too?
 jacek: now urge to trolling subsided&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: He&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: yet we are still here. resigning as a mod doesn't mean that we will completely avoid the site now. just not playing the junction between staff and community anymore
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed.
 darkhorse64: I don't know if it's related. I noticed that Wonto lost his badge recently. What's the point of trolling if there are no mods&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but it's true that I will be less active most likely. no more 2048 or Dice Duel happening
 eulerscheZahl: wonto is a server bug
 eulerscheZahl: still a mod
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: That was/is a CG issue afaik
 balamalexis: who is from grmany
 eulerscheZahl: i am from germany
 jacek: :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: They probably updated the site certifcates :rofl:
 darkhorse64: Undercover mod
 Astrobytes: The Modfather
 BlaiseEbuth: And of course: the Community Masher
 balamalexis: who is from germany
 darkhorse64: Nice typo :grin:
 balamalexis: who
 eulerscheZahl: any mod here to kick?
 jacek: if there was someone with mod powers right now...
 balamalexis: is a nice typo
 balamalexis: who
 Astrobytes: Still have powers.
 BlaiseEbuth: Hitler is from... Austria. nvm
 eulerscheZahl: i was just about to do the same, had already written it :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth check the Godwin point</b></p><p><img src="/a/23496414257567" /> darkhorse64: check the Darwin point rather
 TimberStalker: I found a very simple solution to the hourglass puzzle.
 jacek: :tada:
 Miki09: Who will be the new mods?
 eulerscheZahl: wontonimo is still pretty new and 5nd1l started yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: *5DN1L, sorry
 jacek: did they get a raise
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup. 100%
 epaikins: who wants to try the compete section?
 jacek: whats in the compete section?
 marcelodelazari: guys
 marcelodelazari: is there any way to turn autocomplete off?
 VizGhar: click settings -&gt; edit configuration
 BlackPonyOfDeath_bf10: I'm new guys cwhat's the compete section?
 5DN1L: You select compete section in the menu, and it leads to this page: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 marcelodelazari: i cant find "edit configuration" lol
 VizGhar: you must open code editor first (open any puzzle to see the IDE)
 InnovationINC: e
 marcelodelazari: it worked, thanks
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: hey Astrobytes and eulerscheZahl, its sad to hear you two are resigning&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: just saw that in the chatlog now
 Flaise: Hey guys
 BlaiseEbuth: Sha Wontonimod! Shhhaaaaaaa!
 darkhorse64: English please
 BlaiseEbuth: It is. No-culture-tea-pot
 Flaise: That's some interesting talk about the focus of the site shifting. I joined specifically for the AI contests. I'm not nearly as interested in the rest.
 darkhorse64: I thought you were trying to summon smth
 eulerscheZahl: hey flaise, aren't you the one who did the game-dev thing with illedan?
 BlaiseEbuth: FlaiseEfuth
 eulerscheZahl: you can still play the old contests. great games and strong bots as opponents. just the design of future contests is a bit in the void right now, lots of uncertainty
 resty-daze: it makes me sad that I haven't put enough effort in the past in those ai comps 
 Astrobytes: I believe it is indeed the same one euler
 BlaiseEbuth: You can. While the site exist...
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobviously
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: we'll still be around though&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: there are still a few other sites to look into. but to me CG was always special. simple rules, lots of players and just the contest atmosphere
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/blog/ai-game-competitions-list">https://www.gocoder.one/blog/ai-game-competitions-list</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there are some AI contests running right now
 resty-daze: ye i think CG has the most participants
 eulerscheZahl: only halite had a similar number - that one is dead
 eulerscheZahl: the halite devs started a new project: Lux AI
 eulerscheZahl: but that's a 3 month contest, not 10 days&#160;:(
 resty-daze: is Lux a new name for Risk?
 eulerscheZahl: I only know it as Latin for "light"
 resty-daze: oh no they do not look alike
 eulerscheZahl: light as in sunlight, not as the opposite of heavy
 darkhorse64: For bot programming, I think CG is still unmatched: content, tools, IDE 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/leaderboard-cleanup/193779/5">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/leaderboard-cleanup/193779/5</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's something :tada:
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: and I can't give a &lt;3429 too many requests
 jacek: thats some cleanup eh
 resty-daze: there is a game call Lux Delux in steam, which is a board game called Risk. I was in a ai comp for that game perhaps 15 years ago back to high school days
 TimothyAlexisVass: arithmetic progression x=1, y=2if the progression is linear, and 12 numbers long...This is the sum:-54*x+66*y
 TimothyAlexisVass: Can someone explain why?&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: At least one guy has lost 40K CP
 Flaise: eulerscheZahl: Yeah, I made Desert Digger with Illedan. I'm surprised anyone recognizes me. It was a 10-day game jam competition.
 Astrobytes: flaise: we talk&#160;;)
 struct: lets hope he can clean all leaderboards
 Flaise: Literally the only reason I know about CodinGame is because referrals showed up in my analytics for Desert Digger. I was like "wtf is this site"
 BlaiseEbuth: Why your account not yet deleted struct?
 struct: why would it be?
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Astrobytes: flaise: We may have played Desert Digger a little bit :innocent:
 Flaise: So what kind of uncertainty is there in the future of AI contests on CG? I feel a little out of the loop. Does CG maybe not want to host them anymore?
 TimothyAlexisVass: -_- -_-
 darkhorse64: Actually, CG is tight lipped
 darkhorse64: on the subject
 BlaiseEbuth: CG want money :money_mouth:
 BlaiseEbuth: *CodePad
 BlaiseEbuth: Well... same
 resty-daze: Sure, without money you can't last as a company
 jacek: mods' salaries are too high they almost brought CG to bankrupcy
 Astrobytes: jacek: back in your box lol
 eulerscheZahl: CG started experimenting with new ideas, check "activites" =&gt; "cooperate" at the top
 BlaiseEbuth: capitalists...
 resty-daze: anyone tried that escape things?
 BlaiseEbuth: :nauseated_face:
 eulerscheZahl: it's like an online escape room: you click on things to get clues and solve riddles. some require a bit of coding, others can be done without.and that's what the last contest was about, at the expense of not having a bot contest
 jacek: so they escaped from CG
 Flaise: Pff. I expect companies to follow the money. But AI contests are cool. There has to be money in that.
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't try myself. found a youtube video and quickly scrolled though the timeline to get an impression. just not my cup of tea
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes! You could ban jacek before going!
 eulerscheZahl: Halite did AI contests for recruiting purposes. Then they stopped, to little return on invest
 Flaise: Cooperate mode sounds interesting but I know so little about it
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Never! :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LivwEyf_q8I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LivwEyf_q8I</a>to give you an idea about escape, contains spoilers
 resty-daze: there seems a lot new games in the bot section, any recommend?
 eulerscheZahl: that's also a curse for those games: too many to choose from, so it's hard to stand out
 eulerscheZahl: if you like 3D and have a strong GPU, try dice duel&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: Say the guy who committed half of those games... :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: but really hard to recommend anything. would be easier to name 2 or 3 not to try because of misconceptions
 eulerscheZahl: i won't trash-talk other creators though. among my own i'd say that tower dereference is not worth playing
 jacek: huh
 struct: for board games I recommend breakthrough
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: struct: you still working on that? 
 Astrobytes: +1 for Breakthrough
 struct: yes but not puting a lot of time
 eulerscheZahl: dots and boxes has more depth than I initially thought
 Astrobytes: just ask Smits :D
 resty-daze: taking a note, I can try them one by one
 Astrobytes: I started HS recently, but I got lazy writing the sim
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Listen to eulersche_coffee_Zahl
 Flaise: As an experiment the coop mode does sound interesting but I have no friends so I'm not sure I'll ever try it. xP
 Flaise: T_T
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic is cool
 TimothyAlexisVass: Flaise, make friends here and try it...
 eulerscheZahl: there are coop bot games here as well
 eulerscheZahl: namely code a la mode and fireworks
 Flaise: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: CALM \o/
 jacek: and tutorial ones like onitama or nine men morris

 eulerscheZahl: I just realized that Thibaud wrote "I’ve “cleaned” the top of the GitC arena"

 BlaiseEbuth: Good! let's pursue him for copyright violation!
 eulerscheZahl: they are concerned about possible copyright infringements
 jacek: 42nd?
 Astrobytes: hahahaha :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: and lvl42. that's a lot of answers
 Flaise: Astrobytes: Also, it's not about talking to each other, it's more I tend not to expect people to remember me, even if they'll remember a product.
 resty-daze: They must have a good search skill to find any solution code in CG
 eulerscheZahl: illedan linked your profile and mentioned that you joined CG because of referrers
 Astrobytes: Flaise: It was fresh in our minds since Illedan mentioned you'd come to CG... damn you euler :D
 eulerscheZahl: classic. but you are always faster at kick/ban
 Astrobytes: Fair :D
 Flaise: Oh he said that too
 eulerscheZahl: yes, on a private discord server
 proace21: yooloooo
 Flaise: Ah, haven't checked out the Discord server yet
 Astrobytes: (wasn't on the CG one)
 Flaise: oh
 BlaiseEbuth: A discord server for dissident mods?
 Astrobytes: hahaha, just conversation
 BlaiseEbuth: :suspicious:
 Flaise: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Lambert_W_Function: hi
 Flaise: So when you guys say that the AI competitions on CG are going to become less of the site's emphasis... Are the AI competitions already on the site going anywhere? And is there anything stopping community members from making their own competitions?
 Wontonimo: you can use them
 Wontonimo: and i don't think they are going anywhere.  well, not that i know of
 jacek: bot programming is still available
 Wontonimo: but it isn't their focus anymore
 Wontonimo: so they don't advertise them
 Flaise: Hopefully they either do a really good job of the new stuff or they realize bot programming is just better so they go back to focusing on bot programming. :P
 Wontonimo: and actually they are kind of buried in the user experience so most new members wont even really know about it
 jacek: thats why we need to spam them :imp:
 Wontonimo: i think it is a hard balance of measuring success.  if they want to measure success as active users, then clash of code is great because it has a much lower bar than bot battles and so you can attract more active users.
 Wontonimo: but if you want high quality employable users and be a centre of knowledge and excellence, then bot battles is the way to go
 Wontonimo: i think they are chasing bulk numbers, and that means lower the bar
 Wontonimo: but i don't have any official word on that
 Flaise: Yeah and isn't this site marketed, among other things, as a way to connect employers with employees? Quality is more important because there are lots of other ways to find coders to hire. CG needs a way to stand out above, say, LinkedIn.
 Flaise: Thus, the emphasis if you ask me should be competitino.
 Flaise: ...competition.  ...Such as, not spelling bees.
 5DN1L: and if the players would like bot contests "with time limits", not sure whether that can be added as a feature in the community-made ones. currently all community-made games you can still play are without time limits
 Wontonimo: my experience with recruiters is that by-and-large they go for quantity over quality.  sad as that may be
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Wontonimo: nyoro-n for sure
 Flaise: Well as long as they don't neglect ways for coders to stand out
 Flaise: What's nyoro-n?
 Wontonimo: oh 5DN1L , we could add something in the community made games that bots not published this month are deactivated immediately.  I have a method to achieve it
 Wontonimo: *current month, not *this month
 5DN1L: meaning like one month after the game is approved and starts?
 Wontonimo: no, like there is a published 'key' every month that your bot has to reply with on turn 1 or else it gets deactivated
 Flaise: So you want to see the ranking of all bots published within a time window of a month
 sushideathrobots: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/2125468b0a9c27bf49ebf9b76c054cc5868fc43">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/2125468b0a9c27bf49ebf9b76c054cc5868fc43</a>
 Wontonimo: not here sushideathrobots , post that to #clash
 sushideathrobots: ah
 sushideathrobots: #clash
 Astrobytes: Seems convoluted. Why not just have a monthly leaderboard of active bots?
 Flaise: How about instead of a key, just have the server track last_updated_date of each bot?
 struct: well you can see when the bot was submited
 Wontonimo: both of your ideas are 100% better , absolutely , but those two things are out of our control
 Astrobytes: that's what I'm saying too. It's easy enough to use the API to get the dates
 Astrobytes: iirc
 Flaise: Sounds like a job for one of those external community sites. :O
 5DN1L: What I meant was just to let the community create and approve bot games with the contest element added - i.e. one contest at a time, and everyone creates the bot and compete within that certain timeframe to get the ranking. afterwards, the puzzle can become ordinary bot games again.
 struct: no comunity contests 
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: it was done before
 struct: but it endeed
 struct: ended*
 5DN1L: oh
 Wontonimo: poorly even
 5DN1L: what happened
 Flaise: What went wrong with it?
 jacek: no $$$
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 struct: unnoficial comunity contests dont get enough players
 Astrobytes: Too much work for the devs
 struct: and is too much work
 struct: just to get like 100 players
 Astrobytes: You can do it *unofficially* but good luck getting the numbers like struct said
 5DN1L: understood
 Flaise: I wasn't suggesting a community contest, I was talking about one of those websites that pulls data off the API and compiles it into charts and stuff.
 Wontonimo: well, we could pass around a hat and collect ad money, but i doubt that will happen
 Uljahn: btw Thibaud said there might be "events of the week" in AI format with opening of leagues
 Flaise: Sounds simple enough to be helpful.
 Astrobytes: Flaise: we have a few of those already.You can access most from here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/</a>
 5DN1L: so it's different from a bot game becoming a puzzle of the week, Uljahn?
 Uljahn: guess not really
 Astrobytes: Uljahn: yes indeed, I forgot about this idea - if it is still viable for CG
 Flaise: Right, but do they filter according to Wontonimo's idea
 Flaise: That's cool, though. It's interesting to see the language the top bots are written in. They're like almost all C#, Java, C++, and Python. With traces of other languages for taste.
 jacek: c++ for speed. python for heuristics
 Astrobytes: It's easy enough to leverage the API for your particular purpose, wouldn't take long to come up with something
 Astrobytes: + useful
 Flaise: That sounds like a programming puzzle. Maybe CG should publish a programming puzzle where they have you write a script to use their API to improve the site in some way. And: BAM! Free labor! (I'm joking of course. xD)
 5DN1L: like Euler's puzzle search
 Flaise: Actually, community contests are improvements to the site...
 Astrobytes: hehehe, we already offered our services previously
 Flaise: jacek: Personally I'd go for Rust for speed but I'm a weirdo.
 jacek: there are some rusters here
 Astrobytes: plenty Rustaceans on here

 Flaise: And I have just realized that putting a number sign in front of something makes it a channel link.
 jacek: wasnt tryangle-catch potw?
 Flaise: "I am rank hashtag-five" lol
 eulerscheZahl: yes it was
 jacek: oh my
 Flaise: You wrote the server for triangle catch?
 eulerscheZahl: rules are too complex for anything outside of a contest
 eulerscheZahl: the server? i wrote the game engine
 jacek: no, he wrote miner for the dice duel
 eulerscheZahl: you can create your own game with the CG SDK and upload it
 Flaise: That's what I meant. Cool.
 eulerscheZahl: it will then play battles on CG servers
 Flaise: Oh, right, I remember the froggie icon now.
 jacek: no santa frog?
 eulerscheZahl: you can upload pretty much anything that fits in 10MB
 Astrobytes: Grinch Toad this year I think
 Flaise: I was actually considering playing it but my focus is things that make my profile page look better. I'm doing the mars lander optimization puzzle. :o
 jacek: who seriously looks at the profile page nowadays
 eulerscheZahl: pro tip: you can disable the sound
 jacek: oh and euler is 3rd
 Astrobytes: pro tip 2: Disable the sound
 Flaise: Well isn't CG supposed to help coders find jobs?
 eulerscheZahl: they have a recruiting part which does remote interviews
 eulerscheZahl: CG for work
 jacek: it seems to be their main focus lately
 eulerscheZahl: while you are on the public part of the platform which targets in market share to increase popularity for the paid product
 Flaise: I looked at the recruiting side of the site from the employer's perspective and it says that "they only show candidates who have confirmed their availability to chat in 24 hours"
 eulerscheZahl: interesting, you know more than me
 Flaise: So that leaves me wondering when/if I will get a request to confirm availability to chat because I would definitely like some job interviews.
 eulerscheZahl: i never tried to get a job here. historically CG is strong in France. but expanding in the US too
 Flaise: Then maybe I'm just in a bad area for recruiting?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if anyone currently on the chat can give you a qualified answer
 Astrobytes: maybe a better question to pose on the discord
 Flaise: Hmm, fair enough! I'll ask later
 eulerscheZahl: there's a #jobs channel
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: (on the discord)
 Flaise: Hrmm! Mmk then
 Hackan: hack you
 Astrobytes: kick you
 eulerscheZahl: are you the same Hakan who sent me private messages?

 Automaton2000: note: in this formula, the latitudes and longitudes are expressed in radians. 6371 corresponds to the radius of the checkpoint ...
 jacek: Automaton2000 what about gradians and degrees?
 Automaton2000: thank you a lot of them
 eulerscheZahl: mad defibrilator racing?
 Flaise: ._. ... What?? xD
 KodeyDeuzKalani: yes
 eulerscheZahl: Automaton2000 is a bot
 Automaton2000: you can beat madknight in coders strike back
 eulerscheZahl: say the name and get glibberisch
 eulerscheZahl: -c
 Flaise: "gibberisch"... I'm gonna pronounce it like that from now on
 eulerscheZahl: btw there is tab completion: aut[tab] =&gt; Automaton...

 jacek: Automaton2000 can you though
 Flaise: Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i was almost done with my bot
 eulerscheZahl: "sch" is pretty common in German, muscle memory
 Automaton2000: i think my bot should be able to move to a cell that you have to
 Flaise: that I have to what, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: the order of moves in the future
 Flaise: I feel... "enlightened".

 wlesavo: silver seem so hard with this broken sim
 Uljahn: galleon wars
 eulerscheZahl: coders of the caribbean?
 wlesavo: yeah with this new names i prefer invent my owns xD
 BlaiseEbuth: There is the original name, the new name, and the user's aproximative name...
 eulerscheZahl: my bot for drunken sailors could need some love too
 eulerscheZahl: but would need a full rewrite
 wlesavo: 3 points above boss... i will never laugh at seg again
 eulerscheZahl: seg? seg fault?
 Uljahn: ceg
 Gabbek: hello everyone&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: hi, haven't seen you in a while
 wlesavo: oh i also invented a new nickname :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: but you submitted code of ice and fire recently
 Astrobytes: haha
 Astrobytes: hi wlesavo!
 Astrobytes: and hi again Gabbek&#160;:)
 wlesavo: hi Astrobytes :slight_smile:
 VizGhar: hello :P
 Gabbek: oh noes, the spies! Yep - been trying my luck in lux challenge with nerchio and mostly slacking, writing some smaller scripts here and there -- and lately started fighting with ice&amp;fire to get right behind Zylo, haven't achieved that yet, but who knows -- it might work!
 Astrobytes: wow hey VizGhar! 
 Astrobytes: It's a full-house tonight
 eulerscheZahl: now all we need is inoryy
 Gabbek: what about you, eulerscheZahl, doing fine?
 VizGhar: I've missed you all. So here I am
 eulerscheZahl: yes, more active on other websites recently. and busy with work
 wlesavo: bad thing about cg if i start a multi i start to play at work, so i tend to keep out :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I haven't seen inoryy in a looong while now
 eulerscheZahl: that blazor project is still ongoing
 Astrobytes: Glad to have you back VizGhar&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: yé! VizGhar! ...
 eulerscheZahl: playing at work is much easier at whole without colleagues walking by to see your screen
 Astrobytes: lol wlesavo, how's work going btw?
 eulerscheZahl: at home*
 Gabbek: oh, cool - sadly I haven't touched blazor in a long time, haven't even finished that copy of coders of the realm. The usual lazy me, but atleast I've started helping out aCat a bit, so that's making me quite happy&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and how's your health condition, you mentioned that covid hit you hard
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth slaps eulerscheZahl around a bit with a large covid.</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: ^ that too
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 eulerscheZahl: did i kill the chat?
 wlesavo: Astrobytes great, spent last month writing a paper for cvpr2022, now back to coding =) 
 Gabbek: everyone's waiting for wlesavo's answer&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Oh very nice! You'll be presenting it at the conference or just a submission?
 wlesavo: Astrobytes probably another guy from our group, but the accept decision will be made only around summer i think, they have a ton of submissions every year 
 BlaiseEbuth: Computers c#...
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: Yeah, same with most conferences on anything heheheBest of luck!
 Gabbek: fingers crossed! I wish you and your team the best! Computer vision event, interesting.
 <b>**e_fishel slaps e_fishel around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/74130323480325" /> e_fishel: fish :D
 jacek: how much is the fish
 wlesavo: Gabbek thx :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: btw still no raic t-shirts
 Gabbek: wlesavo we could talk a bit about ships game some time if you would like to, it's a fun one!
 Astrobytes: jacek: Now THAT is worth a ban :P
 BlaiseEbuth: New Orleans hey? :dancer_tone5: :trumpet:
 eulerscheZahl: there was an email, they should start sending the tshirts this week
 e_fishel: there is a python function for flipping case
 solakato: what is this mod system
 e_fishel: indeed
 solakato: its so strict for no reason
 Astrobytes: RAIC: Russian AI Confusion
 5DN1L: solakto, be nice and you can stay
 solakato: if u do capitalized letters
 5DN1L: solakato*
 BlaiseEbuth: use strict;
 Astrobytes: use tab completion;
 solakato: like this
 solakato: AAAA
 solakato: u get a warning like&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i won't miss: too many tab options
 Astrobytes: If you should go skating on the thin ice...
 wlesavo: Gabbek i had a simple MC sim with heuristic shooting, but this rules kept me 3 days in silver  :slight_smile: i tried *a lot* of things, exept for actually reading the rules
 solakato: cool
 Astrobytes: Hm, Radek approved something, must be an aCat thing
 solakato: Astro I dont like ur pfp
 solakato: this statement is enough to get kicked
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Wow, look at the old crowd
 BlaiseEbuth: Simple *insert_something_here* exercise?
 Gabbek: yep, there's something cooking from aCat
 DomiKo: Astrobytes indeed. Can you guess who will approve next?
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Gabbek: haha
 eulerscheZahl: did you approve already?
 aCat: This cat is innocent&#160;!
 aCat: ^^'
 wlesavo: oh, also i pushed cuber Cyberpunk to gold :smiley:
 radekmie: Got me :P
 aCat: (the game is in heavy testing like from 3 weeks or more)
 Astrobytes: It's a Polish invasion again! :D
 DomiKo: it always is!
 radekmie: More like three months :D
 eulerscheZahl: ah, that's the game you showed me
 aCat: False accusations!
 BlaiseEbuth: Call the polish!
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: are you circumventing the approval process right now?
 jacek: leaderboard seems quite polish
 BlaiseEbuth: Why keep contributing to a dead site anyway...&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Looks interesting. Is this based on the idea you had previously aCat?
 RibsOfDoom: how do I erase a part of a vector in c++;
 aCat: Which "previously"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i really think you should give it some time before approving so that others have a chance to comment
 wlesavo: gn everyone
 BlaiseEbuth: What an idea euler...
 aCat: I definitely get the idea since 2 years or so
 eulerscheZahl: fr already hates the cat without this pal review&#160;;)
 aCat: We are in the middle of the students competition
 aCat: and 10 games limit per submit hurts
 aCat: and the game was really tested
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: gn!
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yes, we hate zee cat
 Astrobytes: RibsOfDoom: search for erase-remove idiom
 eulerscheZahl: hi westicles
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 BlaiseEbuth: -_-
 Astrobytes: aCat: DomiKo will win anyway, just give him the prize already :P
 eulerscheZahl: what is the prize?
 aCat: DomiKo is a boss&#160;;-)
 radekmie: A _really good_ handshake :P
 aCat: 2 points for being better than him
 Gabbek: :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: during the pandemic?
 radekmie: That's why there's only a single handshake for all of the prizes.
 DomiKo: :joy:
 Astrobytes: mwahahaha
 eulerscheZahl: 2 points for being better than DomiKo, does that mean that Domi himself can't get those points?
 DomiKo: yeah I can't
 KodeyDeuzKalani: yes
 aCat: He is not in AI4Games course this year
 aCat: already passed with distinction previously :P
 Astrobytes: ahh hehehe, not surprising :D
 jacek: oO
 Gabbek: I had no idea you were so young DomiKo until I've met you :D It was pretty hilarious when I was talking with Czejoo and he thought I was 10-12 years younger... that's what you get for looking you&#160;:(
 KodeyDeuzKalani: yes
 Astrobytes: KodeyDeuzKalani if you have nothing valuable to contribute to the conversation, stop. If you continue, you risk being kicked.
 BlaiseEbuth: yes
 jacek: eeyup
 Gabbek: fastest approval on CG, aCat? Trouble incoming :P
 VizGhar: which approval? let me see
 dwarfie: it is not approval ... it is friendly validation ... what a pity ...
 Astrobytes: As much as I believe it will be OK, I share the concern of dwarfie
 Astrobytes: Also, it's still in beta :P
 e_fishel: what if i hardcode a solution?
 Gabbek: A valid point, I agree, Astrobytes and dwarfie.
 pardouin: you had access to the project before or something&#160;?
 DomiKo: This time more than 3 people tested it, so I belive it will be OK.
 aCat: yes the project is in tests from 3 weeks or more
 pardouin: ok that makes more sense
 Astrobytes: Still a little bit of a shifty move&#160;;)
 DomiKo: Actually 20 people played the game.
 Astrobytes: Looks fun though.
 b0n5a1: if it is really ok, no need of obvious cronyism like that to approve it...
 DomiKo: I must admit that I haven't had so much fun in a long time.
 Astrobytes: ^though I understand the reason it doesn't make it completely OK
 Astrobytes: ^ pointing to b0n5a1's comment btw
 struct: Will any rule change?
 aCat: yeah, students got deadline in the monday, the game was tested
 jacek: cg will take it down and no student will pass
 jacek: :imp:
 aCat: struct we are thinking about one change in AI behavior of monsters
 aCat: other than that only more maps I suppose
 aCat: to prevent hardcoding
 Astrobytes: aCat: If we find bugs we will never let you forget it :P
 aCat: you won;t let me forget it anything ;p
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 AntiSquid: what are you doing aCat&#160;?
 aCat: hm?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-keeper---the-hero-beta">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-keeper---the-hero-beta</a>

 AntiSquid: looks nice 
 aCat: because I'm trying my best!
 aCat: and you are angry at this cat&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, no one's angry :D
 VizGhar: cpp;
 AntiSquid: cute characters
 VizGhar: cool
 AntiSquid: how am i angry at you&#160;?
 aCat: (fast approvals&#160;;])
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: heh heh, remember the JPS debacle?
 struct: now the game will have (beta) in his link forever&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i don't know anything about it
 aCat: I can change the name
 DomiKo: but not the link&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: karma...
 Hackan: bro you are ez
 Hackan: you so ez
 Hackan: gg
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not eulerscheZahl...
 struct: I think the approval is fine, the other people tested it
 Hackan: Who asked you bro?
 mira_cutesaloma: hi
 BlaiseEbuth: euler wanted to ban him, but he's not here anymore...
 struct: well neither is he
 mira_cutesaloma: urm caan we talk
 JustinCamerlingo: no
 5DN1L: if it's coding related, yes, otherwise, no
 mira_cutesaloma: :sweat_smile:
 Flaise: What if the whole world revolves around code? Then we can talk about everything! 
 5DN1L: let's see :smirk:
 mira_cutesaloma: hey why you dont wanna talk with me
 5DN1L: mira_cutesaloma Are there any coding-specific topic you wanna talk about or ask about?
 Flaise: That hamburger I eeted the other day, my stomach turned it into brain fuel. My brain turned the brain fuel into code. Hamburger is code. It just doesn't know it yet.
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, is hamburger code?
 Automaton2000: what is a good choice
 Uljahn: Using the /join command, you can join and create group chat rooms with your friends and discuss your favorite topics.
 Flaise: A good choice is the eggburger from Red Robin. Those are the best code burgers.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's so exclusive for people who don't have friends Uljahn...&#160;:(

 Casstel: yeah that gonna be it thx a lot
 Astrobytes: oohh it's python, I saw this one on discord and was slightly confused

 ZXC01: hi
 TimothyAlexisVass: Find a maximum power of two that divides a given number N
 TimothyAlexisVass: N = 3
 TimothyAlexisVass: how the fuck is 2**1 a divisor of 3&#160;???
 Thorcode: hi TAZ33
 marcelodelazari: 2 ** 0
 marcelodelazari: is a divisor of 3
 Thorcode: 2**0+2**1
 TimothyAlexisVass: yeah but 2 ** 0 is 2 to the power of 0
 TimothyAlexisVass: not 2 to the power of 1
 Thorcode: what about 2**0+2**1
 marcelodelazari: well, the maximum power of two that divides 3 would be 2**0
 marcelodelazari: not 2**1
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yes
 TimothyAlexisVass: The answer was 1 though
 Thorcode: yeah
 TimothyAlexisVass: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db350b6e-0095-4ff0-a833-390ee6403411">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db350b6e-0095-4ff0-a833-390ee6403411</a>

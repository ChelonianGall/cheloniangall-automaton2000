 BlaiseEbuth: Done long before. Not doing it now, sorry.
 TimothyAlexisVass: Did you complete it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes.
 manuthecoder: hi
 Enyx: Hello, I'm sorry if it's stupid but I found where I can upvote or downvote a contribution, but I can't find where I can approve or reject a contribution. Could someone help me please?
 JBM: do you need to?
 BlaiseEbuth: "Verry nice. I love it"
 Enyx: It was to complete the quest map. I don't really need to no but I wanted to x)
 BlaiseEbuth: You need to have played 50+ public clashs to moderate clash contributions, and to be lvl20+ to moderate other ones.
 Enyx: Oh ok so it's because I'm not level 20. Thanks for the answer, I didn't understand how I was supposed to do that
 Westicles: Also, it needs to say 50 clashes on the leaderboard.  For some reason most people have 1 or 2 less when they get the quest map for 50
 ProCoder03: contributions unlock after you played 50 Clashes
 Westicles: There have been like a million people complaining they have 50 on the quest map but can't approve.  They always show 48 or 49 on the leaderboard.  It isn't a public/private thing, something else
 Benji-the-scripter: Help im stuck on second AI quest can someone hellp me with my code?

 mrrobot-caretaker: Hello
 mrrobot-caretaker: What's up?
 mrrobot-caretaker: hey how can i join html clash
 MeBen: HTML isn't a programming language, so an HTML clash wouldn't make sense. Maybe you're thinking of JavaScript?
 BlaiseEbuth: JavaScript isn't a programming language either...
 MeBen: Of course it is
 derjack: is mayonaisse a programming language?
 MeBen: If you write an interpreter for mayo it well could be
 Pantoine: It would be an interpreted language then 
 MeBen: An interpreted programming language, yes.
 derjack: loa sim seems to be finished. but its so slow

 Benji-the-scripter: help im stuck on second AI quest and need help, someone know what to do?
 Uljahn: is it "Your first bot" quest?
 derjack: im stuck, help step-mods
 Benji-the-scripter: yes "first bot"
 Benji-the-scripter: what to do?
 Uljahn: it asks you to reach bronze league, click the quest knob to go to bot ai games

 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Benji-the-scripter: i check now
 Benji-the-scripter: how to code is my real question, i dont understand this with angels
 Uljahn: it seems you can't do the quest yet
 Benji-the-scripter: im new okey
 Benji-the-scripter: i started right now
 derjack: coders strke back should be easy for bronze
 Uljahn: there are other games without angles
 Benji-the-scripter: i try but i cant code
 Benji-the-scripter: im a fricking noob im trying to say
 Uljahn: this site is meant for practice, not for learning from scratch
 Benji-the-scripter: this is all i know about coding                       x, y and nothing more. Thats why im trying =(

 AmazingPro: ok
 AmazingPro: i dont underdstant how you rich so big level, cause u destroy a newbie contributors, downvote to u
 Scarfield: colors are weird in the IDE o0
 AmazingPro: ah anyway you just lonely rude person its ok
 struct: jacek have you faced any non moving state yet?
 BlaiseEbuth: "newbie contributors" that's the problem.
 BlaiseEbuth: Beginner shouldn't create contributions just to validate questmap, or gain xp.
 BlaiseEbuth: Furthermore, there's a moderation system with a dedicated page.
 BlaiseEbuth: If someone want to moderate contributions, he goes there.
 BlaiseEbuth: This way, interested people will see your contrib, other will not... 
 neo_0: do the tests get hard with levels?
 BlaiseEbuth: Excepted if you ask for attention on the chat.
 MeBen: One could argue that the quest map probably shouldn't incentivize beginners to make contributions
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't go on this page anymore because what I see on it make me sad.
 BlaiseEbuth: But you asked, so I went to see. And I given my opinion.
 BlaiseEbuth: If someone disliking what you do look like rude for you, well, don't post things publicly?
 BlaiseEbuth: Nor moderate them MeBen... We said this since the questmap was released.
 MeBen: Seems like they're going for quantity over quality
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 Scarfield: YepstroBytes
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobyep
 Westicles: It works okay if you get intervention for the zimablues
 Astrobytes: Positivefield
 BlaiseEbuth: Zima, eve and robin are on a boat...

 Scarfield: hi :wave:
 struct: hi euler
 eulerscheZahl: btw smartwatch arrived today. ignore my negative vibes about Huawei, all good
 jacek: oO
 jacek: now they know everything about you, your bots, your code
 eulerscheZahl: only that one code. but i think it's visible to everyone anyways
 eulerscheZahl: oh no, it isn't
 jacek: hm?
 struct: usually cf code is available for everyone jacek
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ico_nz15HAg&amp;t=47s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ico_nz15HAg&amp;t=47s</a>what is he doing at 47s? coding in windows explorer?
 eulerscheZahl: they didn't manually publish the codes for that optim contest. i guess they just forgot
 BlaiseEbuth: A hacker! :scream:
 struct: writing on a notepad
 eulerscheZahl: and at 1:33 he says 5 days marathon. codeforces website clearly says 4 days

 jacek: huh
 pyprog: wello
 pyprog: hello
 pyprog: hello
 pyprog: hello
 pyprog: hello
 jacek: bye
 eulerscheZahl: 11 puzzles that we know about. Stilgart got them from his XP history
 jacek: why would they be removed
 jacek: and how
 eulerscheZahl: low rating, CG bot
 eulerscheZahl: and a few even manually I think, before the bot existed
 BlaiseEbuth: Missing a "removed optim" category... I'll tell him.
 eulerscheZahl: you can still see them when you tinker with the URL. e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/bet-payout-calculator">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/bet-payout-calculator</a>
 eulerscheZahl: which optim did we lose?
 eulerscheZahl: aaah
 BlaiseEbuth: TGD :cry:
 eulerscheZahl: the great dispatch
 eulerscheZahl: that was a good one&#160;:(
 Westicles: you can still play it though
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 BlaiseEbuth: 'f course
 eulerscheZahl: why TGD? it was nice and all.can't we just sacrifice Aneo?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know the company, all that comes to my mind is a boring puzzle
 BlaiseEbuth: It's planned iirc
 eulerscheZahl: i won't miss it
 Westicles: wait, you can still play all the deleted ones?
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course
 eulerscheZahl: and get the XP afaik
 Westicles: oh boy
 liboy129: wsp
 liboy129: :taco:
 liboy129: :burger
 BlaiseEbuth: "removing" mean removing the link. Any delete in db could erase the entire website... :smirk:
 Westicles: cool.  anybody have the list?
 eulerscheZahl: just use the chadok list and replace /training/easy in the URL with /ide/puzzle
 BlaiseEbuth: They made a little script to 'unmod' me after a server reboot. I regularly see the mod icon coming back, and disapear short time after... Simpler than correcting the real problem :p
 eulerscheZahl: ./BlaiseEbuth.sh

 eulerscheZahl: i'm getting more and more annoyed, please stop spamming
 struct: euler when is next match of yare?
 eulerscheZahl: in 3.5h approx
 eulerscheZahl: getting nervous already
 struct: so if you make it to the final
 struct: you will play vs the same guy&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but i need 2 wins just to reach the finals
 struct: 3rd already has a prize
 eulerscheZahl: and my bot vs the finalist had some weaknesses that I can try to clean up before a match
 eulerscheZahl: my usual strategy of playing defensive at first doesn't work against him so I had to try a barely tested bot and failed
 BlaiseEbuth: Best defense is attack.
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i would probably go for a rush in the finals (if i make it there)
 BlaiseEbuth: Zergling rush ftw
 jacek: rush b
 struct: 13 moves game on loa o.o
 jacek: share it
 jacek: oh you cant&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you can. give us your password
 jacek: dupa.8
 struct: I can jacek
 jacek: via ludii?
 struct: via ascii art 
 struct: :p
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/4mVQKRBL">https://pastebin.com/4mVQKRBL</a>
 struct: on console looks better because it has colors 
 jacek: is this from demo or local
 struct: local
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: as I was explaining on #fr, there is also TGD (optim made by CG) 
 struct: I ran millions of games
 struct: to get shortest and longest
 struct: longest was 650+ moves
 struct: but is just random moves
 eulerscheZahl: yes, blaise reminded me about our loss
 eulerscheZahl: and there was this official puzzle. finding the central node of a graph
 jacek: longest can be forever
 Alastor69: whats up ya wankers! whose ready to... ah, what the bloody hell happened!?
 eulerscheZahl: the thing that JBM recreated with some tissue story
 Stilgart: but I won't add this one, since its removal is special
 struct: you are right jacek
 Stilgart: CG did stuff to really hide TGD 
 eulerscheZahl: and when we tell everyone that it's still online, they might completely delete it
 jacek: TGD?
 Stilgart: as for the other removed puzzles, dwarfie did not found more in his XP history
 struct: the great dispatch
 Stilgart: The Great Dispatch
 struct: was an optimization puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: they once deleted a leaderboard of an internal contest after I linked it on the announcement of another contest which turned out to be the same game
 Stilgart: anyway, my number of puzzle solved in haskell is still not right, even with TGD
 eulerscheZahl: CG is a mystery
 Stilgart: maybe I should count Detective Pikapcha (contest) and A*C (contest) 
 Stilgart: we need a new puzzle/optim contest to check this :D
 eulerscheZahl: that would be another lost bot contest&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: we have optim on codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/94906">https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/94906</a>
 Stilgart: not even sure I used Haskell at some point for A*C, though
 Stilgart: the only code I still have is in C++
 struct: maybe ill join that one euler
 Kepe55: Has anyone read the Competitive Programmer's Handbook? Has it helped?
 eulerscheZahl: haven't read it. not reading it did not help
 jacek: therefore reading it did help?
 Kepe55: I think finishing it and only then beginning to practice more is good, I will know most algorithms and stuff like that
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: read it for us, please
 Automaton2000: then at the end of the game and it was a feature
 Criptor: anyone have code on c++
 struct: yes
 Criptor: can you share?
 struct: code for what?
 Criptor: coders strike back
 struct: My code is unreadable 
 eulerscheZahl: and what did you learn if we just copy a bot here and you insert it in your IDE?
 Criptor: don't worry I try to understand
 struct: also my code wont work on lower leagues
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have C++ code
 struct: I think sim for loa should be done
 struct: But sim is so expensive
 struct:&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loa">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loa</a>
 Astrobytes: So expensive that the time needs to be increased/games shortened? Or doable?
 struct: Expensive in comparison with c4
 struct: The goal to beat ludii number of sims per second was surely beaten
 eulerscheZahl: how many do you get?
 eulerscheZahl: and what's the ludii number?
 struct: ludii was like 100 per second lol
 jacek: playouts, as in random games to the end?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know the rules of the game. but sounds like a rookie number
 eulerscheZahl: or readability over speed
 jacek: ludii is interpreted (?)
 struct: im joking yes
 struct: I only get 20k&#160;:(
 struct: per sec
 eulerscheZahl: noob
 derjack: dunno how much I get, but i get 5 plies negamax with some eval
 derjack: in 100ms
 struct: let me do ept 5 plys rollout
 struct: The move gen is quite expensive here
 struct: at least mine is
 struct: There are probably better approaches 
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: im thinking of masks and pext
 struct: no idea yet how to eval this game
 jacek: for now i use popcount of center 6x6 and try to minimize the number of independent chains
 struct: I will try mcts since i can copy paste it from the other games
 struct: but I dont have high hopes for it
 jacek: youd want to have at least some smart rollouts, otherwise most of them would be draw with the turn limit
 struct: rollouts wont be a problem if I dont do them
 struct: do you currently use Rays to get the legal moves jacek?
 struct: I currently have rays[64][4];
 eulerscheZahl: you need more rays to solve Space Maze
 struct: path games are not my strong
 struct: Maybe one day ill manage to learn it
 jacek: yeah i have rows, columns and diagonals
 jacek: and antidiagonals
 struct: thanks

 jacek: rare isnt it
 jacek: W to move
 struct: nice
 struct: was it local?
 jacek: yes
 struct: I was trying no rollout
 struct: but ill run out of nodes
 jacek: 1st world problems
 struct: solver seems to work I guess
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/fOAzePA.png">https://i.imgur.com/fOAzePA.png</a>

 struct: ah wait
 struct: I had no eval
 Wontonimo: eulerscheZahl, for <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/">https://yare.io/</a>, how much compute can you do?  it says you have 600ms per turn, but do you have effectively 600ms of compute?
 Wontonimo: i'm wonder if Simulation+Search or Eval+Search is even reasonable
 eulerscheZahl: honestly: I don't know Wontonimo. I managed to get some timeouts (only applies for your current turn) though
 struct: Did the round ended euler?
 eulerscheZahl: first game in 45min
 eulerscheZahl: i feel like before a big exam at school/university
 eulerscheZahl: one where i'm not sure if i'm well prepared
 eulerscheZahl: i'll try with my standard bot first. and rush if the default fails
 eulerscheZahl: semi-rush.rush and then retreat. hoping that I cause more damage than I took
 struct: hope it works

 ZarthaxX: he didnt stand a chance
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX! How are ya dude?
 ZarthaxX: hey!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: who mudrc?
 ZarthaxX: im tired
 Astrobytes: Working a lot huh?
 ZarthaxX: past weeks have been exhausting and i have an exam today
 jacek: hello tired
 ZarthaxX: starting to code a bit in work yes
 ZarthaxX: hello jacek :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Ah, you'll manage. SuperZarth
 Wontonimo: is there a second round?
 ZarthaxX: yes im chilling
 eulerscheZahl: best of 3
 Astrobytes: Are you 3rd in the standings now euler or 2nd? (before this I mean)
 ZarthaxX: how are u astroman
 Wontonimo: when does it start&#160;?  and what's the link?
 eulerscheZahl: if i win, i get into battle for top3
 Astrobytes: Same old crap different day ZarthaxX. Though am currently medically signed off from working, which is incredibly boring
 eulerscheZahl: or i'm 4th and out
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 ZarthaxX: so you wont work until you are back up?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Depends
 Astrobytes: Still waiting on that scan btw
 ZarthaxX: since when???
 ZarthaxX: D:
 Astrobytes: That's almost a year and a half now
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: health stuff sucks with covid in the middlestill
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so $300 $900 or $1800 ... nice eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: you know my mom was about tto call a doctor to continue the health analysis for my grandma that were paused since covid started
 eulerscheZahl: oh right the link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/d1/080gw16z2ia7">https://yare.io/d1/080gw16z2ia7</a>
 ZarthaxX: and at the same time my grandma contracted urinary infection and died a few days later 
 ZarthaxX: we didnt even notice she had one, she was perfect
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Aw goddamnit ZarthaxX, so sorry to hear that brother
 ZarthaxX: that was 2 weeks ago
 ZarthaxX: week after that had a final exam with my motivation down asf
 ZarthaxX: sometimes i wish you could put a pause in life 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I feel that man
 Astrobytes: That sucks hard.
 ZarthaxX: yes&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: oh, sorry to head that ZarthaxX&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: are you feeling okey at least astro?
 ZarthaxX: a bit okeish
 ZarthaxX: thanks toad &lt;3
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: Painful but good otherwise, it's just so damn restrictive in terms of what I can do
 ZarthaxX: it's pretty hard to move on as she was living with us for 5 years
 struct: grats on the win euler
 ZarthaxX: hey structo
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes can you give an example of that?
 ZarthaxX: what are not able to do?
 ZarthaxX: you*
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: I feel that dude. Although he wasn't living with me looking after my Grandad for the past 5 years totally changed my life, then when he was gone there's a big hole 
 Astrobytes: Still not over it. You never get over it. You just learn to live with it.
 Astrobytes: Yeah. So, unless I dose up on painkillers I can't remain upright for anything between 10-25 minutes.
 Astrobytes: If I take painkillers I get 30-45 minutes (still with pain, but bearable).
 TimothyAlexisVass: :D
 ZarthaxX: i know i know, but takes time to get over it
 Astrobytes: It takes me 2 or 3 days to mow the lawn, 2 or 3 days to cut the hedge, another 2 or 3 days to pull the weeds
 ZarthaxX: wat???
 ZarthaxX: have you been living like that for the past year?¡
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: A lot of time.
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 TimothyAlexisVass: Change your garden
 ZarthaxX: oh god wtf
 ZarthaxX: are those painkillers like expensive or have bad secondary efffects???
 Astrobytes: And it's worsening recently, which is why I'm signed off this month
 eulerscheZahl: that doesn't sound too healthy on a long-term scale&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Codeine, not something you wanna take all the time
 Astrobytes: Thankfully I have a high pain threshold
 karter1231211: everything started to go down hill when we said we were going to raid area 51
 ZarthaxX: okey that sucks
 ZarthaxX: you should pressure people to get that health studies done tbh
 ZarthaxX: you cant live like this, it's a really bad life quality you got
 Astrobytes: I even had to be excused from jury service, since it was in a town quite far from here (due to Covid)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I call them every week.
 Astrobytes: Makes no difference.
 Astrobytes: Hey, there are cancer patients not getting treatment here because of the state of the health system, I am (rightly) not highest priority
 ZarthaxX: well yeah, cancer patients are in the same situation here, and some even die coz of it&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Same here. It's obscene&#160;:(

 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I got a little bussy bye
 icecream17: wow these wood bot strategies are soooo simple
 Wontonimo: which multi icecream17&#160;?
 icecream17: Space Shooter
 Wontonimo: it's all wood
 Wontonimo: for space shooter
 icecream17: I only implemented "shoot bullets at enemy all of the time" which made me beat wood 1, and tie so much in wood 2 (with a few wins) that's i'm #1 (just below the bot)
 Wontonimo: shots adjusted for your own movement and enemy movement AND moving out of the way of the enemy shots is enough to destroy wood 2
 EMERALDZZZ: baby mama
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode and EMERALDZZZ, join the space battle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/space-shooter">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/space-shooter</a>
 EMERALDZZZ: nah
 struct: hi
 EMERALDZZZ: hi. mr.mod
 Laysin: im trying to learn to code and this site is not helping at all
 struct: its not really for beginners
 struct: its more to improve your current skills
 Laysin: ok what do you recomend
 Laysin:&#160;?
 struct: not sure, i havent used learning sites in a while
 Laysin: ok
 Hosein1864: hey!
 struct: hi
 Hosein1864: I am a beginner
 struct: same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :laughing:
 struct: my ai cant beat ludii&#160;:(
 struct: at least for now
 Hosein1864: where are you guys from?
 struct: portugal
 Wontonimo: Hosein1864 سلام [hello]
 struct: What language do they speak in Iran?
 Wontonimo: Persian
 struct: Did you made any improvements on tron Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: i got to legend
 struct: I saw
 Wontonimo: then i stopped
 struct: I was here
 struct: Yeah
 struct: im still trying lines of action
 struct: very hard game
 Wontonimo: that's great that you are helping with the game in the early days
 struct: I enjoy board games for some strange reason
 struct: maybe im getting old
 Wontonimo: i've got another game i'm thinking of, either opti or multi.
 struct: what kind of game?
 Wontonimo: Each round you are given 100 quotes from a book, and you have to classify them as real or fake.  You are also given the answers to the round before.  It's a NLP task.  For multi, it is up to the players to make fake sentences to fool the opponent
 ZarthaxX: hello
 struct: Could be interesting
 struct: hi again ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: waddup
 struct: not much, just trying to make a working bot on lines of action
 dkslslep: 코딩 어렵다.
 ZarthaxX: i read yesterday about that
 ZarthaxX: is it interesting?
 struct: about the game or about what I said?
 ZarthaxX: everything :P
 struct: well only if you enjoy board games I guess
 ZarthaxX: i do..
 ZarthaxX: doesnt it have a big branching factor tho?
 struct: yes
 struct: 30+moves per turn
 struct: and moves are not trivial to compute
 ZarthaxX: you mean bitboard
 struct: yes
 struct: they are easy
 struct: to do
 struct: but expensive
 StopDiscriminatingAsian: Stop Being Racist
 struct: Nobody here is being racist
 StopDiscriminatingAsian: Thank you for understanding
 ZarthaxX: wdym by expensive?
 ZarthaxX: i saved the magic bitboard thing that was shared here the other day
 struct: which magic o.o
 ZarthaxX: i want to take a look at that
 struct: ah the one I shared
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.rhysre.net/fast-chess-move-generation-with-magic-bitboards.html">https://www.rhysre.net/fast-chess-move-generation-with-magic-bitboards.html</a>
 ZarthaxX: right
 struct: i dont use it yet
 ZarthaxX: is it interesting mindblowing?
 struct: havent read it all yet
 ZarthaxX: thought there was no more bitboard magic to know
 struct: I just wanted to get something working first
 ZarthaxX: more than the one we already know
 ZarthaxX: oh ok..
 ZarthaxX: i have been trying to find a board game that is "educational"
 struct: currently i have an array with rays for each bit index
 ZarthaxX: like for people learning about graph theory to code
 struct: so RAYS[64][4]
 struct: 4 directions
 ZarthaxX: okey
 struct: ZarthaxX c4 might be good
 ZarthaxX: ah that one was already used
 ZarthaxX: cn even
 ZarthaxX: n from 3 to 8 i think
 struct: breakthrough is nice but hard to eval
 ZarthaxX: butt i wanted another option
 ZarthaxX: right...
 struct: but very easy to sim
 ZarthaxX: loa? :P
 ZarthaxX: right, i wanted a super easy sim
 struct: if breakthrough is hard to eval
 struct: I dont know what loa is
 ZarthaxX: what's your opinion on isolation
 ZarthaxX: if you know the game
 ZarthaxX: kind of wondev woman
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: well if its hard its interesting as you can apply many heuristics
 struct: you told me about it before I think
 ZarthaxX: just a game where you have a board,  you move to adyacent and remove a cell
 ZarthaxX: the player tha t cannot move loses
 ZarthaxX: classic
 struct: What about amazons?
 struct: very small branching factor
 struct: only 1k moves first turn
 struct: :D
 struct: damn my minimax times out depth 5&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: 1K???????????????
 ZarthaxX: WAT
 ZarthaxX: 5 isnt that bad right?
 ZarthaxX: D:
 struct: well
 struct: 30^5
 struct: it can be even higher than 30 so
 ZarthaxX: 24m..
 ZarthaxX: it's dope
 struct: 1k on the 8x8 version
 ZarthaxX: did toad play another yare game btw?
 struct: on 10x10 is 2k+
 ZarthaxX: wat.
 struct: on 2nd turn can be 4k+
 ZarthaxX: fuck amazons
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: yes
 struct: he won 
 ZarthaxX: twice'?'
 ZarthaxX: he got to top 3?
 ZarthaxX: :O
 struct: he is now playing to go to the final
 ZarthaxX: right now?
 struct: yes 3rd is garanted
 struct: no
 struct: should be today 24-09
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: he will win pro
 ZarthaxX: b
 ZarthaxX: well then so amazons is a no
 ZarthaxX: i liked the infexction game that darkhorse shared
 struct: Will you use it to teach?
 ZarthaxX: i have a plan
 ZarthaxX: but is 1 year from now
 ZarthaxX: just curious
 ZarthaxX: i need to do smth before :P
 ZarthaxX: anyway was just interested in gathering options
 ZarthaxX: i have to try them myself obv
 ZarthaxX: but as you are the master of board games&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: i thought it was a good idea to ask
 struct: I think c4 has some pluses
 struct: easy to sim but you need to do some stuff to have a good bot
 struct: but is a little bit bland
 struct: after a certain point is very hard to improve
 struct: if you want you can look at my bot
 ZarthaxX: ah..
 struct: I can even share my bot if you want, i have shared it before
 ZarthaxX: well wait, i didnt say the important part of using this for teaching
 struct: ok
 ZarthaxX: ppl would have to make an heuristics bot
 ZarthaxX: depth 1
 ZarthaxX: fitted with a GA 
 ZarthaxX: that's all
 ZarthaxX: the idea wasnt to smash their brains
 ZarthaxX: THO i could teach minmax if they allow me to lol
 struct: ah
 struct: I thought it was mcts or something
 ZarthaxX: you mean share your code?
 ZarthaxX: nah..
 struct: yes
 ZarthaxX: i would like to teach mcts tho..
 ZarthaxX: it's nice graph theory
 ZarthaxX: but might be hard
 struct: clobber is easy to sim but hard to eval imo
 struct: a lot of moves
 struct: like 128 on first turn
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: i need to go into all these games on summer
 ZarthaxX: prob i wont anyway
 ZarthaxX: i need to finish uni to have life again
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: :D
 ZarthaxX: clobber also looks interesting
 ZarthaxX: will try
 ZarthaxX: anyway, post exam headache killimg me
 ZarthaxX: gotta go D:
 struct: gn
 ZarthaxX: good luck with your loa thingy
 struct: thanks
 ZarthaxX: gn&#160;:*

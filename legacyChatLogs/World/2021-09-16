 BlaiseEbuth: People that read the faq...
 BobTheBuilder888: me being confused
 Westicles: Reading #fr has me anxious.  They said my definition of group is wrong but not how
 BlaiseEbuth: Hm?

 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. And that's false?
 Westicles: Not sure.  Just something about west of the testicles defined group wrong
 BlaiseEbuth: When? Hadn't seen that.. :thinking:
 Westicles: Couple days ago.  Maybe he meant the fix Benoi helped me with
 Westicles: I think abstract algebra must be taught more in france than the US
 littlebear: In codingame login page why animation in background is not working
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a couple of professors and math phd among the #fr regulars... Not being one, I don't see anything chocking in your statement ^^'
 Westicles: Hopefully it is just incomplete.  I mean, you would have to write a book to capture everything
 [CG]Thibaud: nice catch littlebear, thanks
 littlebear:&#160;:)
 MeBen: Any way to find clash problems in the contributions so I can access test cases afterwards?

 Wontonimo: :thumbsup: Thanks!
 ghassanmas: hi
 MSmits: mmh I discovered something weird with windows forms / C#
 MSmits: I used a text box and then double.parse, but it wanted me to use a comma instead of a dot for decimal separator
 Maxim251: Shock... Sorted by pointer value
 MSmits: did not know it would be sensitive to the settings on your operating system
 Astrobytes: that's a feature
 MSmits: it's a bug to me :P
 Astrobytes: I thiiiink you can mess with locale settings and have it how you want
 MSmits: i ran my meta mcts for a day with an exp par of 25 instead of 2.5 because of this. Well got some good exploration in i guess&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: but I'm no C# wiz
 Astrobytes: lol
 ProCoder03: windows API's use your current windows settings..
 MSmits: apparently so&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I think we established that
 MSmits: yes but he used the correct language 
 MSmits: like a pro
 Astrobytes: :P
 ProCoder03: change your language to English(US) to make dot as decimal seprator..
 MSmits: yeah, but this would have tons of side effects I would not be happy with
 Astrobytes: System.Globalization -&gt; CultureInfo ... could be tweakable in there
 MSmits: I'll leave it as is. Just have to remember to use comma's in windows forms is all
 Astrobytes: actually, just in System.Globalization
 MiyamuraIzumi: What is meta mcts then?
 MSmits: a mcts program that runs bots instead of a normal simulation phase
 MiyamuraIzumi: is this an existing concept&#160;?
 Astrobytes: That's when you think about doing MCTS really hard without doing it.
 MSmits: that too :P
 MSmits: MiyamuraIzumi yeah it is
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: basically i start a game, like one on CG to replace simulation with
 MSmits: a game with 50 ms turns and all that
 MSmits: which makes the search much stronger
 MSmits: it runs for days, weeks or months, whatever you want
 MSmits: you gather information about the best opening moves and you can often solve parts of games
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh, I see
 MiyamuraIzumi: I found this
 MiyamuraIzumi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/46262/on-generating-opening-book-for-yavalath-mcts-bot">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/46262/on-generating-opening-book-for-yavalath-mcts-bot</a>
 MSmits: yeah that's similar to what i do, but somewhat different. I also took it to another level. But that's good reading
 MiyamuraIzumi: this should be one of it use
 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks
 MSmits: thank jace k , he wrote it. We started using meta mcts at about the same time
 MSmits: he mostly does NN's now
 MSmits: I still like running them
 MiyamuraIzumi: for NN's
 MSmits: i plan on using meta mcts info for NN's as well yes, but I am not sure how effective it will be
 MSmits: but before this i was just using it to generate hardcoded opening moves
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh, I see
 MiyamuraIzumi: can I use this for hard code end-game?
 darkhorse64: You need a solver for endgames
 MSmits: depending on the game you can use an endgame book generator instead. You would not use mcts for that, but more a minimax style solver
 darkhorse64: first
 darkhorse64: :stuck_out_tongue:
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 MSmits: MiyamuraIzumi i have written something about generating endgame books for oware
 MSmits: it's a playground, should be on my profile
 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks
 MiyamuraIzumi: I will check that
 MSmits: but it requires that you're pretty familiar with oware
 MiyamuraIzumi: I don't know oware actually
 saad_here: anyone up for coc?
 MSmits: for which game would you like an endgame book?
 ProCoder03: UTTT ig..
 MiyamuraIzumi: UTTT
 MSmits: would not really work for uttt
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh
 MSmits: you can look up the last miniboard result
 struct: game is decided early
 C26_1: Oh hello stuct
 C26_1: struct
 MSmits: or you can *maybe* lookup the last 2 boards
 struct: wont work for games like c4 and uttt
 MSmits: but you'd use a huge amount of space to do this
 struct: it can be good for breakthrough but its not massive because early game is also important
 struct: hi
 MSmits: games need to be convergent for it
 C26_1: I've made my demo of theory about base analysis
 MSmits: checkers and chess converge
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fec9bafb-1dfc-4007-b103-631d01e3e77c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fec9bafb-1dfc-4007-b103-631d01e3e77c</a>

 MSmits: yes
 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks
 struct: I cant play that game
 MiyamuraIzumi: why?
 struct: sim seems a mess
 struct: same for yavalath
 MSmits: yavalath sim is easy 
 C26_1: simulator needs a lot of "random" variable 
 MSmits: coding heavy rollout is hard
 C26_1: so yea that's why sim is a mess
 MSmits: oware sim is messy yes, because of the exceptions
 MSmits: C26_1 what do you mean a lot of random?
 C26_1: I mean sim means simulation of something right 
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: oware sim is just a bit fiddly, not straight up difficult
 C26_1: For example, you need to simulate the life of a human
 MSmits: yeah the exceptions are just annoying to code and when you've done that you're left with a feeling that maybe there's still a bug you're never going to find
 struct: now that i print my rollouts on c4
 struct: I think I have a bug
 Astrobytes: this is why we test our sims thoroughly
 C26_1: then you have random variables like stock market variables, shop price, the odds of being born at somewhere, etc...
 ProCoder03: That's what I am exactly facing with UTTT..
 MSmits: C26_1 we're talking about simple board games here :P
 C26_1: oh
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: sorry if misconception
 MSmits: np
 MiyamuraIzumi: just a bit: do we have any new info on FC2021&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It will probably be around Halloween
 MiyamuraIzumi: is it still a multi?
 Astrobytes: That's all
 MSmits: ProCoder03 yeah uttt sims can have bugs and sometimes it's annoying to find, but it's not as complicated as oware. 
 MiyamuraIzumi: ummm
 struct: yes
 struct: practice beam search
 MiyamuraIzumi: do you mean we should practise beam search for FC2021?
 MiyamuraIzumi: struct?
 struct: maybe
 MiyamuraIzumi: FC2020 and Spring 2021 is beam search
 ProCoder03: Well it turns out.. My sim is correct, My Ultimateboard is messing up something 
 Astrobytes: The point is we don't even know if it will be multiplayer bot programming
 ProCoder03: bcoz of that I get invalid output :angry:
 MiyamuraIzumi: maybe FC2021 is an codingEscape game haha
 ProCoder03: For heaven's sake, Nooo......
 Astrobytes: I really hope not.
 Astrobytes: But we will wait and see.
 ProCoder03: where can I learn Beam Search.&#160;??
 MSmits: beamsearch is super intuitive if you've done other searches
 MSmits: make a list of moves
 MSmits: generate new states
 MSmits: score each state
 ProCoder03: Ohh... I have not done any...
 MSmits: keep the best X
 MSmits: if X is smaller than the beam width, keep all
 struct: I dont think it can even be a escape
 MSmits: i mean if the number of states is smaller than X
 struct: It doesnt make sense 
 ProCoder03: like FlatMC execpt for the last one ....
 Astrobytes: unless it's single player escape
 struct: that goes against escape
 ProCoder03: I would need 2 hrs to find it :rofl:
 Astrobytes: ProCoder03: it's more like a BFS
 ProCoder03: I have never done any search in my life....
 struct: Its BFS with pruning
 ProCoder03: execpt for MCTS...
 struct: if you can do mcts you can do beam
 MSmits: ProCoder03 mcts is a much more complicated search
 MiyamuraIzumi: MCTS is still a search
 MSmits: BFS, DFS, beam are all a lot easier to do
 MSmits: you can do a BFS in 10 lines of code or something
 <b>**ProCoder03 notes down the list to learn before FC2021</b></p><p><img src="/a/61784826959548" /> MiyamuraIzumi: then FC2021 is a CodingEscape
 ProCoder03: commit suicide..
 ProCoder03: just kidding..
 MiyamuraIzumi: haha
 struct: I dont think I know DFS/BFS
 MSmits: this has BFS and I think other algos
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2f3651108d">https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2f3651108d</a>
 ProCoder03: Thank you so much struct
 MiyamuraIzumi: actually Spring2021 is quite interest in that pure Heuristic can go very high rank
 struct: ah I know bfs
 struct: because I did it for stc to calculate all possible game states depth 4
 eulerscheZahl: you did it to find regions of the same color
 MSmits: even if you didn't know bfs, you would have invented it alreadty
 struct: depth N*
 eulerscheZahl: or the distance between 2 cells on tron
 struct: I never calculated distance on tron&#160;:(
 struct: but you are right
 struct: floodfill is bfs
 MSmits: I invented binary search for batman without ever knowing the algorithm. Some stuff is so simple you can think of it yourself
 Astrobytes: *can be BFS
 eulerscheZahl: in discovered dijkstra myself on project euler problem 80-ish
 MSmits: that's cool
 struct: hmm graphs
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=83">https://projecteuler.net/problem=83</a>
 struct: my kryptonite
 struct: Maybe I should learn graphs for next contest 
 MSmits: I am half-proficient with graphs
 Astrobytes: a grid is a graph
 MSmits: yeah, i mean I know how to find an algorithm to do a specific thing in a graph, more or less, but i dont know many of the names of these
 struct: hmm, cant imagine connect 4 as a graph
 Astrobytes: Plenty places to practice. I found using some kind of visualiser helps get the ideas down
 MSmits: the gametree is a graph
 struct: But im also bad in grid games
 struct: grid and graphs
 MSmits: for graphs, try eulerscheZahl's tryAngle game
 struct: maybe im bad in all the games
 sprkrd: hello all
 struct: :p
 ProCoder03: okay guys can someone tell me what I *must* learn before FC2021 :pleading:
 MSmits: you're good at boardgames now struct
 sprkrd: what do you need to know about graphs. I know EVERYTHING about graphs&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hello sprkrd
 struct: yeap ive become good but now its too late
 MSmits: if you had played them 2 yrs ago when nn's weren't here, you'd be top 3 in every one of them
 struct: NNs have appeared 
 struct: also I would not say im good, I mostly reuse the mcts and just make a fast sim
 sprkrd: (in case it wasn't obvious, my display of arrogance was a joke)
 Astrobytes: I thought it was obvious&#160;;)
 struct: where to start sprkrd?
 MSmits: fast sim usually means having some insight into the game
 MSmits: not just avx-ing stuff
 Astrobytes: unless you are struct, in which case start by avx-ing everything
 MiyamuraIzumi: @ProCoder03, playing escape more
 struct: i always wanted to write an AI for gitc
 struct: but dont know how to start
 ProCoder03: Urghhh.... why are you so stubborn on it MiyamuraIzumi
 MSmits: struct can't help you there. It's hard
 ProCoder03: I also completed all the freely available ones...
 MSmits: i think what people do is use a lot of heuristics to generate strategic plans
 MiyamuraIzumi: haha
 MSmits: then run them for X turns against an assumed opponent
 MSmits: and keep the best version
 struct: ah
 ProCoder03: what's gitc&#160;??
 MSmits: ghost in the cell
 struct: I always struggle in multiple units games
 eulerscheZahl: ghost in the cell

 MSmits: you lost to a 40+ yr old man euler
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 MSmits: just rubbing it in 
 eulerscheZahl: i've reached the 30+ myself&#160;:(
 MSmits: ah yes you did
 MiyamuraIzumi: I watched the vids about xor NNs, but don't really know how can I apply it for a multi, could any one give me an advice?
 MSmits: start practicing with small projects before a multi
 Astrobytes: first half of your 30s is great, it's the second half that sucks
 MSmits: what i did (and which is not necessarily best) is adapt the xor example to learn gamestates for normal TTT
 struct: 30s? whats that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 Astrobytes: You young ones these days
 MSmits: so i generated  all gamestates for TTT, calculate their endgame result with minimax and taught a NN to output these results
 <b>**Astrobytes shakes fist at clouds</b></p><p><img src="/a/61784826959548" /> MiyamuraIzumi: oh, thank you all
 MSmits: this oware azero implementation is *not* a good place to start with NN's
 MSmits: but it is very good nonetheless
 MSmits: start simpler though
 MiyamuraIzumi: well the point is I only know some basic syntax of Python
 MSmits: i learned python by practicing puzzles here
 MiyamuraIzumi: does this mean I should learn Python first before learning NNs
 MSmits: i solved around 30 and then i moved on
 struct: I would focus in other skills before attempting NNs
 struct: specially for cg
 ProCoder03: if u know C++, then python is a breeze MiyamuraIzumi
 MSmits: yeah nn is a high end skill i think
 MSmits: I would say learn all the basic search algorithms, make some bots for all sorts of games first. Broaden knowledge before deepening it in some area you might not even like
 MiyamuraIzumi: well then NNs later :D
 MSmits: learning NN just because it seems the new hot thing that beats other types of bots, is a bad motivator. You'll quickly get discouraged
 MSmits: yeah, we'll still be talking about it a year from now, so no hurry&#160;:)
 MiyamuraIzumi: why a year from now on?
 MiyamuraIzumi: what can we say or do in a year?
 MSmits: i just mentioned a random long seeming amount of time
 MSmits: if I were euler's age, I might have said month. To those youngsters it seems like a much longer time
 MiyamuraIzumi: well, but do I need python to learn NNs
 Uljahn: no
 MSmits: mmh it's not 100% necessary, but pretty convenient
 Astrobytes: When you get to that point I think you can pick up what you need along the way
 ProCoder03:  it just easier in python
 MSmits: python is like reading English anyways
 MSmits: if you know a different language, using python is not so much learning as it is getting used to
 MiyamuraIzumi: then I will try on with some more multi then
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is playing a contest in JS right now, despite not really knowing the language</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: and it's not even a big deal
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 MSmits: he plays kotlin heroes too, without even really being a hero
 eulerscheZahl: i am
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: story time :D
 eulerscheZahl: so, last sunday. I had a flat tire again (the 4th this year)
 eulerscheZahl: was pushing my bicycle to my brotzer in-law to fix it
 Astrobytes: the pizza day right
 eulerscheZahl: then 2 teenagers behind me screaming "what do you want from us! heelp!"and the guy "stop running away"
 eulerscheZahl: and all of the sudden, those 2 teens were hiding behind me
 eulerscheZahl: i tried to deescalate and calmly asked what's the matter, what they have done
 eulerscheZahl: "the problem is what they have not done! they shall go back to Afghanistan"
 Astrobytes: Ugh, seriously
 eulerscheZahl: so i was facing this violent and angry man
 MSmits: ohh, they were refugees?
 eulerscheZahl: they looked and sounded really German to me
 Astrobytes: Grown men picking on teenagers is never a good thing
 eulerscheZahl: said they didn't even know him, were just passing by and then he chased them
 MSmits: maybe he had mental issues
 eulerscheZahl: so we were facing each other, only my immobilized bicycle between us
 eulerscheZahl: glad he left after maybe a minute or so and it didn't get to a fight
 eulerscheZahl: serious WTF moment
 Astrobytes: Heeeere he comes to save the dayyyyyMiiiiiighty Toad is on his wayyyyy
 eulerscheZahl: :cape:
 eulerscheZahl: oh&#160;:(
 struct: 4th tire o.o
 ProCoder03: is pathfinding algorithm same as BFS&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that sucks. got a new tire now
 Astrobytes: Ribbit-ribbit-ribbit-ribbit TOADMAAAN
 struct: but do they always replace the tier?
 struct: or jsut the inner tube?
 eulerscheZahl: just the inner (first 2 times at a bike shop)
 eulerscheZahl: 3rd time: the brother in-law who found some glass
 Maxim251: OMY God, it works :D
 eulerscheZahl: 4th time: well, there was some damage done to  the tire (because of the pushing?)
 struct: I would ask them to put a solid inner tube next time
 Astrobytes: Brother-in-law fixed it 4th time too?
 eulerscheZahl: i hope it's not the metal part of my tire. i'll see in a few weeks i guess
 MSmits: well gj on the hero thing eulerscheZahl
 [CG]Thibaud: huh feels bad, for both the tire and the people chasing the refugees
 eulerscheZahl: yes. i owe him another puzza now
 Astrobytes: Was gonna say, double pizza debt
 eulerscheZahl: there weren't even refugees (which wouldn't make it better)
 MSmits: i feel bad for the refugees tbh, not the people chasing them :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah that's what I meant :D
 [CG]Thibaud: had a flat tire too 2 days ago
 MSmits: I know&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: i see some code. with just 2 spaces for indents. what's your message?
 eulerscheZahl: fix the compiler errors?
 Astrobytes: I think he's showing how he got the priority_queue sort to work
 Astrobytes: from earlier in chat
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i lacked that context
 eulerscheZahl: too busy with yare
 Astrobytes: It took me a few minutes
 Astrobytes: How is it going?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://challonge.com/yare">https://challonge.com/yare</a>still in group stage
 Astrobytes: nice
 Astrobytes: enjoying it?
 eulerscheZahl: kind of. a bit much trying to counter specific strategies i think
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see how to write a proper search on this thing. and heuristics always turn into a mess for me
 eulerscheZahl: improving one thing makes it fail somewhere else
 Astrobytes: Aye, that's never much fun
 eulerscheZahl: when you switch from "standings" to "matches" above the groups, you can see a replay link in the game details
 eulerscheZahl: there's just a variety of highly different bots
 eulerscheZahl: and as you can only test vs online players, it's hard to get feedback
 Astrobytes: wow, you got rekt in the game I just watched
 eulerscheZahl: i changed a line of code and didn't test it&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: That round thing came along and zapped all your triangles
 eulerscheZahl: then my units always thought they were in imminent danger
 Astrobytes: Yeah they looked a little indecisive
 ProCoder03: At least you are in the tournament, I am still trying to find my algo work haha.. 
 eulerscheZahl: i think i could have just rushed that opponent. but didn't want to show him his weaknesses that early in the contest
 Astrobytes: fine line between progressing and managing to keep a secret strategy for later
 eulerscheZahl: yes. now it's just the group stage. elimination round comes after
 eulerscheZahl: and the best 4 out of each group proceed
 Astrobytes: The game itself seems pretty cool, just find the platform mechanics a bit odd
 eulerscheZahl: and I have a bit of simulation for the fighting at least. I know when I should attack<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/replay/isygv1s24w1l3">https://yare.io/replay/isygv1s24w1l3</a>

 struct: Thibaud was the type of game decided for the contest?
 struct: or will it only be announced when the official date is
 eulerscheZahl: i still have a lot of holidays to take.  please give me a reason
 ProCoder03: competing in yare
 eulerscheZahl: took a week off before the contest so i don't start with a completely broken bot
 MiyamuraIzumi: Escape
 ProCoder03: Urghhh,,,, WTF are you so interested in it MiyamuraIzumi
 eulerscheZahl: that's the elephant in the room, that we fear
 struct: also thanks for giving me yavalath back :p
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't be happy with a puzzle contest either. Opinions vary on that though.
 MiyamuraIzumi: puzzle contest?
 MiyamuraIzumi: is multi consider a puzzle?
 BlaiseEbuth: 5% weirdo
 Astrobytes: No. It's like how CG did contests back in the day. A lot of the official puzzles were contests at some point.
 eulerscheZahl: except for the last crusade, which was considered too hard
 [CG]Thibaud: yes game format is decided and some of you probably won't like it :worried:
 MiyamuraIzumi: they are old, I don't think CG will do like it
 Astrobytes: Oh dear.
 MiyamuraIzumi: ohhhh
 BlaiseEbuth: 5% of you
 Astrobytes: Can I read that as 'not a multi'
 eulerscheZahl: i read it as "raising popularity for a new format"
 ProCoder03: yes ig...
 MiyamuraIzumi: can I read that as "Coding Escape"
 [CG]Thibaud: will be a Coding Escape. Should be announced beginning of next week
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 ProCoder03: No....
 <b>**ProCoder03 + gonna commit suicide </b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: I believe he is trolling
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it coming, so the disappointment isn't even that big at this very moment
 MiyamuraIzumi: learning beam search for Escape ProCoder03
 MiyamuraIzumi: you'll need it
 eulerscheZahl: still sad
 ProCoder03: Bruhh... sometimes I prefer doing it by hand compared to writing code..
 [CG]Thibaud: I'd have preferred a bot programming game too
 Astrobytes: Gonna be a bunch of very p***ed off people who only come around for contests...
 [CG]Thibaud: still I'm curious if this can bring unregular players
 Wontonimo: I just stopped in and saw the announcement about the format.  Thanks for sharing Thibaud
 Astrobytes: Personally I think replacing multi bot contests with escape is silly, separately it would seem to make more sense
 Astrobytes: But I get that CG is pushing that format
 eulerscheZahl: it's just completely different user bases
 struct: constests /= 2;&#160;:(
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't know. Let's see how it goes
 Astrobytes: Yes euler
 eulerscheZahl: i think that escape contests can work. like tech.io can toobut you'll have a hard time promoting it to the right people
 [CG]Thibaud: haven't you all played a few coding escapes on your own?
 ProCoder03: Atleast, is it solo or team [CG]Thibaud
 [CG]Thibaud: team
 Astrobytes: I think the escape thing for companies as teambuilding is a great idea
 littlebear: wow
 struct: I played as a team yes
 eulerscheZahl: i played 0.5 escapesthen I got sleepy and ditched the team
 MiyamuraIzumi: Escape for 11 days
 Astrobytes: I played a few with struct, Scarfield and TBali
 struct: But I cant really compare a cg contest to a escape puzzle
 [CG]Thibaud: for sure
 struct: its not even remotely close
 Astrobytes: indeed
 ProCoder03: Done for&#160;!!, Where is the heck can I find teammates :confused:??
 [CG]Thibaud: in this chat?
 eulerscheZahl: the contest is an ongoing thing where you reserve a full week and get as much spare time as you can to invest into this huge event. go to bed and see how much you dropped the next day
 eulerscheZahl: you are happy when it starts. then you are again when it's finally over
 darkhorse64: ^
 MiyamuraIzumi: ~
 eulerscheZahl: that escape contest will be done after a few hours. then the activity will quickly be back to normal
 Astrobytes: Yes. Our yearly doses of pain and misery.
 ProCoder03: But I suppose everyone will have a pair or grp of friends
 [CG]Thibaud: yes, the peak of activity will be really short
 Astrobytes: But you're looking to retain those new users
 ProCoder03: Ig got to search from now on&#160;!!
 [CG]Thibaud: those who can't invest the needed hours for AI contest could participate
 [CG]Thibaud: probably not new users Astro
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 [CG]Thibaud: just users we've been excluding for years with AI ^^
 eulerscheZahl: decision is made, so let's see how it will work out. despite being disappointed personally, I still hope that you succeed with your contest
 [CG]Thibaud: thanks
 Astrobytes: Yes, I wont lie and say I'm not disappointed but I hope it works out.
 BlaiseEbuth: The advantage is that CG will get a lot of new accounts! Most of them will be dropped after a few hours, but statistics gonna inflate! :tada:
 [CG]Thibaud: obviously not the goal Blaise
 Astrobytes: Can't even console ourselves with RAIC this year either&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC is just postponed, not cancelled
 eulerscheZahl: but i haven't heard anything about mini RAIC recently
 Astrobytes: Yeah but postponed til next year though
 [CG]Thibaud: why was it postponed?
 Astrobytes: And they said mini RAIC would happen this year too, which it hasn't
 eulerscheZahl: i have to take my days off before april, so i'm fine
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC in February
 eulerscheZahl: not sure why
 Astrobytes: might have to start doing the load contests
 eulerscheZahl: highloadcup?
 Astrobytes: yeah lol
 eulerscheZahl: they are much more work to set up and get started
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've checked it out
 eulerscheZahl: there are these occasional surprise contests on codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: optim
 Astrobytes: true
 Astrobytes: and atcoder sometimes
 struct: time to delete&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Oh no you don't :P
 darkhorse64: time to write a new multi
 struct: no ideas for multi 
 eulerscheZahl: so much effort for just a few players
 darkhorse64: pick your favorite board game of the moment, clone
 struct: i dont play board games
 MiyamuraIzumi: haha
 darkhorse64: I don't too except here
 struct: I never played any of the games I ported
 ProCoder03: Wontonimo had some ideas about some doll boxing using verlet physics..
 eulerscheZahl: port "Mensch ärger dich nicht"
 eulerscheZahl: or Memory
 ProCoder03: is it Ludo&#160;??
 struct: seems like it
 struct: isnt it just rolling a dice?
 eulerscheZahl: a die
 struct: ah but you have multiple pieces
 eulerscheZahl: 1 die2 dice
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, multiple move options
 Astrobytes: You play chess darkhorse64 no?
 ProCoder03: we have chess already right :thinkingL
 darkhorse64: I used to
 Astrobytes: Before CG 
 darkhorse64: I have been playing chess seriously for 20 years
 Astrobytes: I haven't played seriously since I was quite young
 darkhorse64: But I was not strong. My best was 1960 ELO
 Astrobytes: my grandfather used to organise the chess conference &amp; tournaments in and around my town
 Astrobytes: I suck pretty badly these days
 eulerscheZahl: i played against a classmate once, who was really good at chess.told be 3 moves in advance that i'm about to lose my knight. but he was wrong, I lost my rook :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: you showed him
 Astrobytes: Did you see the news MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: the contest news?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MiyamuraIzumi: beam search for finding escape path
 struct: I guess ill just pick a multi now and play it like it is a contest
 eulerscheZahl: inspect page source code
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if this contest will reflect back on the contest leaderboard
 MiyamuraIzumi: 11 days
 MiyamuraIzumi: for beam search
 Astrobytes: Not 11 days. A few hours. And no search.
 Samzok123: hi
 darkhorse64: DP puzzles did
 Astrobytes: DP?
 eulerscheZahl: dynamic programming?
 darkhorse64: Detective picaptcha
 Astrobytes: Oh the pikachu thing with the not Moebius strip
 eulerscheZahl: that fake Möbius strip :rage:
 struct: ill port ludo, not sure how bots plays there
 struct: But it can go over 150 turns per player I guess
 Astrobytes: Ludo? Isn't that random based on die roll?
 eulerscheZahl: you can have 300 turns per player (1 vs 1 game, 50ms/turn)
 struct: yes astro
 struct: also I dont need to give the turn to player if its only 1 move
 struct: I can just play that move on the referee
 struct: so it doesnt take time
 Astrobytes: Snakes &amp; Ladders next? :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4713/conflix">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4713/conflix</a>

 Astrobytes: (I read "escape the cannibal's soup pot" as "escape the cannabis soup pot" lol)
 darkhorse64: head already into the pot&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 [CG]Thibaud: &gt; i wonder if this contest will reflect back on the contest leaderboardit will not eulerscheZahl
 MiyamuraIzumi: * haha
 MiyamuraIzumi: too silent
 struct: yes im finishing ludo
 MiyamuraIzumi: what is ludo
 struct: its a board game
 MiyamuraIzumi: I mean do you port a game for it?
 MiyamuraIzumi: can you give the link?
 MSmits: I did not see the contest news Astrobytes
 MSmits: where do i see it?
 darkhorse64: Just announced on the chat
 darkhorse64: by tibo
 MSmits: oh
 darkhorse64: The contest is a team coding escape around Halloween
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 MSmits: i see. Not sure if I'll compete. Will have to be with one of you guys if I do. 
 MSmits: if it's only a few hrs it has to fit my schedule too. Usually thats possible
 struct: MiyamuraIzumi check here
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775</a>
 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks struct
 MSmits: btw, I think I would prefer a solo puzzle speed like detective pikaptcha over escape even
 MSmits: even though i am not that good at those puzzle things
 darkhorse64: Not so surprising given CG will push to push these kind of events. They are also promotiing it rather than hackathons which means that semi private contests may also disappear
 darkhorse64: *will to push*
 MSmits: well I don't mind them pushing those really if this is good for CG
 MSmits: as long as I can do my multis&#160;:)
 MiyamuraIzumi: Did you ever play Escape MSmits?
 MiyamuraIzumi: at least finish one of them?
 MSmits: No, but just the fact that it's a team thing turns me off already&#160;:)
 MSmits: I mean, i would not mind trying it once, in this contest with some of you
 MSmits: but the general concept does not appeal to me
 darkhorse64: RL escapes with friends are fun
 MSmits: i did a break in room, which is kind of the same but reverse
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes, to some extent
 MSmits: they just gave me all the paper puzzles and stuck me somewhere while the other guys did all the running and picking up of stuff
 darkhorse64: sane labor division
 MSmits: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/11/us/escape-room-burglar-trnd/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/11/us/escape-room-burglar-trnd/index.html</a>
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 MiyamuraIzumi:  
 MSmits: "He did call 911. That's not a win. He quit," 
 MSmits: very funny
 DJFunkyMaster_9a81: q ondaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Astrobytes: As a teenager I had to escape from someone's house once without being seen by their parents...
 DJFunkyMaster_9a81: piola
 darkhorse64: someone = girl&#160;?
 MSmits: bad boy Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: guilty as charged darkhorse64
 MSmits: the main question is though. Did you succeed or did you drop off a roof or something?
 MSmits: or both
 Astrobytes: I climbed out her window, went down the drain pipe about halfway, jumped and legged it through the neighbours garden
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: Wasn't so hard to do
 MSmits: you could have just gone out the front door and said: Sorry, wrong house
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: fun times

 eulerscheZahl: somehow i'm always attempted to do the exact opposite
 eulerscheZahl: same as when youtubers tell me to like and subscribe
 TimothyAlexisVass: tempted?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;:/
 TimothyAlexisVass: It happens
 eulerscheZahl: and last time you posted that clash, i told you that you should indicate the direction of the rotation
 eulerscheZahl: clockwise/counterclockwise
 TimothyAlexisVass: OK
 TimothyAlexisVass: - is counterclockwise and + is clockwise, I thought it was obvious from the examples..
 eulerscheZahl: your 2nd reviewer even wrote that as a comment. and still approved
 eulerscheZahl: the statement should be clear enough that you don't need examples to fully understand the task
 Samzok123: hi
 TimothyAlexisVass: Feel free to improve the contribution, I always do that when I think something can be better. Between you and me, I see it as a matter of opinion.
 eulerscheZahl: meh, clashers should decide about their puzzles. i'm just passing by because you linked it on the chat. my interest is more in the multiplayer section
 TimothyAlexisVass: OK
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm a bad and selfish user: wanting others to review my puzzles while ignoring theirs
 struct: Same
 struct: I dont think I ever reviewed one
 struct: I think bit runner is the exception
 eulerscheZahl: good thing we have jacek and tric trac
 TimothyAlexisVass: ^ _ ^
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, gtg :soccer:see you tomorrow
 struct: hf
 Illedan: bye
 struct: hi Illedan
 Illedan: yo
 struct: any recent improvemnt on fb?
 Illedan: Mostly random stuff that doesn't work
 struct: I feel your pain
 struct: its still impressive regardless 
 Illedan: But I pushed everyone down. So I need a lot of wins to gain top 2
 struct: ah yeah
 struct: its way harder now
 struct: unless you have &gt; 60% win rate vs top 2
 Illedan: Best I had was 75%+ vs rest and 50% vs top 2. Still 1 point below pb&#160;:/
 struct: so it has similar strength
 Illedan: I guess they win more vs the rest
 struct: probably, cant remember it was a long time ago
 struct: recurse bot was also a bit stronger than pb4
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/6krgi6S">https://imgur.com/a/6krgi6S</a>This is the earliest screenshot I have from their previous ranks
 pb4: hi
 struct: hi pb4
 pb4: Just in case, because we got very frustrated back in the day with Neumann
 pb4: If someone has a good AI and feels that the ranking system is holding them back, I'm open to a simultaneous resubmit to give more chances
 pb4: (back in the day on CSB)
 pb4: Would need some kind of cgbench stats showing &gt;50% winrate with 95% confidence interval for example
 pb4: hi struct&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Thyl: Be patient. He will either get bored or escalate, in which case he will get banned.
 Thyl: thx Astrobytes
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes: Just some idiot kid that Uljahn banned the other day 
 struct: I see
 struct: Usually they pm me Hi
 struct: and thats about it
 Astrobytes: This one thinks he's real smart.
 shonal45: hi 
 shonal45: im new
 shonal45: in the game 
 struct: hi
 TimothyAlexisVass: Do you like nutritional yeast?
 struct: never had any
 Astrobytes: if used sparingly as part of a flavouring involving other herbs and spices it can be good, otherwise its like an inedible bad cheese
 Astrobytes: What's with all the weird questions recently? Dapo's shoes, Timothy and the nutritional yeast...
 Astrobytes: CG chat is becoming a self-help group
 BlaiseEbuth: Hello. My name is Blaise. And today, it's been 5 months I haven't participated to a bot contest.
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: hmm floodfill distance seems to be working
 struct: maybe ill try tron after all
 TimothyAlexisVass: ..(\ /)..(•.•)  c(")(“) 
 struct: i have ascii art ptsd
 TimothyAlexisVass: oh goodness I'm so sorry
 MiyamuraIzumi: you can't participate to ... well
 TimothyAlexisVass: Sometimes when I answer a captcha, I try to answer it without clicking all of the traffic lights.
 MSmits: when you're feeling robotty?
 JBM: i usually click on as little as i think i can get away with
 struct: usually when I finish them they make me repeat it&#160;:(
 Westicles: so they verified escape room contest?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup...
 struct: yes
 Westicles: Huh.  I wonder if it gives CP.  They'll have a revolt if it doesn't
 struct: Maybe it will give cp, but it wont count towards contests rating 
 Astrobytes: I don't think it will be particularly successful. I wish them the best with it but I'm not convinced. Time will tell.
 struct: I just dont know how it can be a contest
 struct: does it start at the same time for everyone?
 BlaiseEbuth: :smiling_imp:
 struct: Can be quite hard to get everyone to play at the same time
 struct: But Im sure they thought of that
 BlaiseEbuth: :zipper_mouth:
 Wontonimo: i haven't really loved escape room irl, so i'm not all that jazzed :shrug:
 Wontonimo: and I hear you have to work as a team.  I come here to get away from having to work with a team&#160;;)
 struct: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hi hi
 Wontonimo: i won't üse a ü in your name anymore
 Wontonimo: struct
 struct: lol
 struct: im trying tron atm
 struct: ill try to check if depth 1 voronoi is really enough for legend
 struct: I dont want to put a lot of effort on this game
 Wontonimo: if I had stayed focused and not just dabbled I'd have an iterative deepening minimax by now.  just played with flat MC far too long
 Astrobytes: don't go too deep in the alphabeta is what I'd recommend
 Wontonimo: deep as in optimization, or deep as in plies&#160;?
 struct: i always go straight into mcts tbh
 Astrobytes: plies
 Wontonimo: why not?
 Astrobytes: It's not great to get too deep in 3-4 player games
 Astrobytes: Too much uncertainty imo
 Astrobytes: I had far better luck limiting the depth somewhat
 struct: So my first step should not be optimize&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: As always YMMV
 Wontonimo: thanks Astro
 Astrobytes: And I don't know if MaxN, paranoid or only closest opponent is best
 Wontonimo: i gotta go.  my got has that "i'm so bored that i'm gonna get in trouble" look.  Going for a walk.  seeya
 Wontonimo: my dog
 Astrobytes: I will experiment at some point
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: lol, clears the head too&#160;:)
 struct: cya
 Astrobytes: finally banned that knobend from the discord
 struct: who?
 Astrobytes: The one I mentioned earlier
 struct: ah
 Astrobytes: Yazuni
 Astrobytes: Give 'em enough rope
 struct: Don't think I ever saw him
 struct: But I'm not really active on discord
 Astrobytes: Well his posts have been deleted from the past 24 hours, still some left in General I think
 Astrobytes: Just a kid with too much time on his hands evidently

 MSmits: got my new Y bot working without book
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/581283865">https://www.codingame.com/replay/581283865</a>
 MSmits: loses to arena bot (with book), but look how soon it knows it's lost compared to my old bot&#160;:)
 struct: thats a lot sooner
 MSmits: frame 41 new bot says LOSS.  frame 48, old boss says WIN&#160;:)
 MSmits: old bot
 MSmits: yeah, it's the late game pruning I think
 MSmits: prunes equivalent safe moves.
 struct: Which rank do you think it would get?
 struct: without book
 MSmits: crap rank. I already tested it vs dafish, tric trac etc.
 struct: ah
 MSmits: It does well vs darkhorse
 MSmits: problem is early game traps, mcts is just bad with that
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: those minimax bots find em
 struct: I made 1 ply for tron
 struct: Lets see if I can get legend
 MSmits: nice, if you do, you beat mine&#160;:)
 struct: I need to improve it a bit though
 struct: i already did :p
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 MSmits: this is a graph game btw
 MSmits: there's some tricks around separating out areas that are only connected by 1 tile
 MSmits: because you cant go to one area and then back
 MSmits: so your floodfill cant count them both
 MSmits: these are graph tricks
 struct: I just reused my floodfill from stc
 MSmits: yeah thats fine to start with
 struct: i added distance too it and it seems to be working
 MSmits: nice
 struct: But I probably wont waste a  lot of time on it
 struct: Im not really a fan of 3+ player games
 BobTheBuilder888: why not?
 MSmits: me neither. It's hard to write a search that makes sense
 struct: And this game is not balanced at all
 BobTheBuilder888: true.
 struct: There are starts that is obvious which player will win
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: they do rotate, but then you just get a draw
 MSmits: like uttt mirror with p1 win advantage
 BobTheBuilder888: i would only be able to make a stable 4+ player site if i was block coding&#160;;-;
 MSmits: block coding?
 BobTheBuilder888: you know, with those blocks
 BobTheBuilder888: they are reactangle blocks and its so much easier to code with, but you cant block code a site.
 BobTheBuilder888: rectangle*
 struct: like scratch?
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah
 BobTheBuilder888: i learnt from scratch but... im banned
 struct: banned from scratch?
 struct: how?
 BobTheBuilder888: i got muted alot because all these kids were coming at me being racist and sexist
 BobTheBuilder888: but i found another game like that, but it also had python 3, html/css, javascript, ps.js and java
 BobTheBuilder888: anyways, does anybody know how to code a cps test using javascript? Im gonna make one today because i wont code for a while after today..
 struct: whats a cps test?
 BobTheBuilder888: clicks per second test.
 struct: change image start timer wait for click stop timer
 struct: ah clicks per second sorry
 struct: i thought it was reaction time
 struct: but should still be similar
 BobTheBuilder888: i guess

 Legedy: yo
 BobTheBuilder888: yes?
 myNickName01: in the clash of code, there should not be an option to share code, it should auto be shared
 BobTheBuilder888: nah because what if your embarrassed of your code?
 altr: ^
 ZaAinavolTrash: Insert your depression here:
 altr: i can write code, but normally i dont
 altr: good code*
 BobTheBuilder888: i can write code, but im not good at it
 altr: i feel like if im on this site too much ill start writing i=input in my regular scripts
 struct: I usually golf production code
 Wontonimo: it's a good way to keep noobs out of it
 struct: hi mr Wontonimo
 struct: today I tried tron
 Wontonimo: and?
 Wontonimo: how did it go?
 struct: im at 87 gold
 Wontonimo: i guess i can check
 struct: I did 1 move and voronoi
 <b>**Wontonimo looks at my rank.  sad face</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: I can help you if you want
 struct: im still trying to get legend
 Wontonimo: i should just implement minimax
 Wontonimo: wait ... 1 move and voronoi?  not minimax or mcts?
 struct: yes just 1 move
 struct: for my bot
 Wontonimo: okay, please help
 struct: ok 3 moves
 struct: left up or right
 struct: or down 
 Wontonimo: all first moves
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: 1 move
 Wontonimo: cool.
 struct: Ok so this is what I do
 struct: I try all those moves
 Wontonimo: i'm all ears
 struct: and score to see if I can reach them before enemy
 struct: so basicly voronoi
 struct: and I keep the best one
 struct: actually i check against all opponents
 Wontonimo: you only do 1v1 for each opponent?
 struct: i do 1vs all
 ZaAinavolTrash: How is everyone doing with their sanity..
 ZaAinavolTrash: bc scripting could trigger something ngl--
 BobTheBuilder888: im starting to think to learn C++ instead of javascript, any tips?
 Wontonimo: maybe my voronoi is different.  how does yours work?
 BobTheBuilder888: or C#
 struct: I do floodfill to calculate distance to every cell
 struct: so shortest distance
 Wontonimo: and what do you do with distance?
 Wontonimo: don't you use area?
 struct: I keep the distance for all the bots
 struct: so I know how much it takes for a bot to reach each cell
 struct: then I just compare my cells distance from opponent
 struct: and check the ammount of cells that im closer
 struct: and choose the highest one
 BobTheBuilder888: lice is very dangerous
 BobTheBuilder888: my mum got lice and she died
 BobTheBuilder888: my uncle got lice and he died
 Wontonimo: be nice, stay on topic, talk about coding or coding game.  dems the rules
 BobTheBuilder888: my grandma got lice and she lived, but she lived a very licey klife.
 struct: yeah lets keep it coding related
 struct: while people are talking about it
 BobTheBuilder888: i am coding a story?
 struct: if people are not talking about it im a little more lenient 
 BobTheBuilder888: anyways

 BobTheBuilder888: other than if else
 BobTheBuilder888: damn the questions inside the pastebin
 struct: you are printing the word thrust 
 struct: you need to print ' 100'
 BobTheBuilder888: no thats my variable
 BobTheBuilder888: it equals 100
 struct: like that it isnt
 BobTheBuilder888: oh, and im on wood 2
 Westicles: plus it is trust
 gggsfjw: im new to coding what are the 5 most important things
 Wontonimo: tell me more, i don't quite understand this - "then I just compare my cells distance from opponent and check the ammount of cells that im closer and choose the highest one"
 struct: i sum them all
 struct: the ammount that im closer
 BobTheBuilder888: important thing
 BobTheBuilder888: 1. Variables
 BobTheBuilder888: 2. Functions
 BobTheBuilder888: 3. Testing your code
 Wontonimo: 4 arrays
 struct: Bob its enough spam
 Wontonimo: he is answering gggsfjw
 struct: oh sorry
 struct: :p
 Wontonimo: but he could have done it as one line
 BobTheBuilder888: oh
 Wontonimo: at first i thought it was spam also lol
 BobTheBuilder888: nah
 Wontonimo: that's what happens when you did a little, people start to assume you are doing more
 BobTheBuilder888: me dont spam unless i hate the devs or something
 BobTheBuilder888: and i like the devs here
 struct: Wontonimo this is what I do

 struct: distance is 3d array
 struct: distance for each player to each cell
 BobTheBuilder888: hey struct, should i swap javascript for a better coding language like C# or C++
 BobTheBuilder888:  
 struct: depends on what you want to do
 Wontonimo: back to floodfill with distance2   1   2   3   4   5   5   4   *   *1  M   1   2   3   4   4   3   2   *
 struct: yes
 struct: that what mine looks like
 struct: So i use that to score in the array distance
 struct: store* in the array
 Wontonimo: let's say M is my move and E is enemy move.
 Wontonimo: what is the score in this case?
 Wontonimo: oh, let me look at the pastebin
 struct: 14-10 I think
 struct: 14-9*
 BobTheBuilder888: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f7b1730-da3a-4ca9-b8de-6b22a571949a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f7b1730-da3a-4ca9-b8de-6b22a571949a</a>
 BobTheBuilder888: anything wrong with it?
 Wontonimo: how is this different than area?
 struct: sorry i did not know what you meant by area
 struct: should have asked
 Wontonimo: Bob, this is what you want
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e145acbd-91b7-4f1f-a6b3-4821663e1a0b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e145acbd-91b7-4f1f-a6b3-4821663e1a0b</a>
 Westicles: ha, that's mean
 CodingBugs: How do I approve a community submission? I have over 50 games clashes played which the forums say is the requirement
 Wontonimo: if it isn't a clash, you need other requirements
 Wontonimo: like having done a lot of puzzles
 Wontonimo: or unlocking the ability in the quest map
 Wontonimo: it should tell you
 CodingBugs: Ah okay, I see now! Thank you!
 CodingBugs: I can only approve clashes, not classic puzzles
 Wontonimo: your code l looks like each player does its own flood, like this2   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   *   *1  M   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   *  &lt;-- where the enemy is here
 Wontonimo: because&#160;: distance[i][y][x] &lt;= distance[0][y][x]
 struct: ah yes
 Wontonimo: wouldn't work unless each player filled their own map without considering the other players fill
 struct: im not being of much help
 struct: yes each player does his own fill
 Wontonimo: THIS IS VERY HELPFUL&#160;!  That is the insight i'm missing
 BobTheBuilder888: ill wait later to ask you why my codes not working............
 struct: We told you
 struct: First you are using wrong python syntax, second you are using python mixed with javascript, third you are printing the word thrust instead of the value of the var
 Wontonimo: i was doing sync fill on a boolean board and I'd get nearly similar scores but in edge cases it's different.
 Wontonimo: oh, that's why you said that's mean.  haha, i didn't really notice
 Wontonimo: what lang are you using bob?
 Wontonimo: probably javascript
 Westicles: I just meant the trust/thrust thing
 Wontonimo: thrust = Math.abs(nextCheckpointAngle) &gt; 90&#160;? 50&#160;: 100;console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' ' + thrust);
 Westicles: anyhow bob, programming isn't for everyone.  the world needs fry cooks as well
 Wontonimo: that's Westicles' way of encouraging you (I think) to learn faster 
 Wontonimo: thanks for sticking with explaining your approach struct!  much appreciated
 struct: np
 struct: Ill stick for a bit
 struct: trying to find a bug
 Wontonimo: i'm not going to code it tonight.  i'm kinda bagged from a long workday of coding stuff I really don't want to be coding which is fairly untestable
 struct: i had it easy
 struct: I just reused my floodfill from stc
 struct: but needed to add distance to it
 Wontonimo: stc?
 struct: smash the code
 struct: puyo puyo
 struct: I dont have a finished bot there but I do have the sim
 Wontonimo: legend "I don't have a finished bot" lol
 struct: yeap
 struct: I think the current submit is a very handicapped version
 Wontonimo: i think we use the word "computationally challenged" now
 struct: ah sorry
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: hmm ... bob went away.  i even reached out on private with better and correct code
 Wontonimo: also, looks like West left also
 BobTheBuilder888: im back
 struct: wb
 Wontonimo: how did you come up with that version of voronoli&#160;?
 struct: hmm I thought it was like this
 struct: I didnt read anything
 Wontonimo: i'm really trying to see how this is different than area.  i'm stumped actually
 Wontonimo: oh my, i didn't disable dead enemies in my flood fill
 struct: lol
 struct: maybe thats the problem
 Wontonimo: for some reason it is doing a lot better in this submit
 Wontonimo: :eye: :regional_indicator_l: :eye:
 Wontonimo: I'm "taking the L"
 struct: lol
 struct: i guess ill try bfs depth 1 and then add 1 extra ply for me
 struct: and eval
 Wontonimo: wow, my score was -0.02 for a sec
 struct: close to demotion
 Wontonimo: hmm...  that's weird.  my rank isn't any higher.  it's actually lower
 struct: With the bug fix?
 Wontonimo: yea
 struct: We call those features
 Wontonimo: re-submit!
 struct: gl
 Wontonimo: thx
 Wontonimo: well, that is for me for tonight.  thanks for the insight
 struct: np, gn
 ZaAinavolTrash: Yo
 struct: hi
 BobTheBuilder888: im back
 BobTheBuilder888: but i guess alot of people left
 STOP4643: hi
 sio0322: hi
 Leejuwoo: hello
 ProCoder03: Good morning!!
 BobTheBuilder888: good afternoon!
 Leejuwoo: good lunch
 Alex4200: good morning.
 JustinZhang: how to read the color in smash the code?
 JustinZhang: how to input the color

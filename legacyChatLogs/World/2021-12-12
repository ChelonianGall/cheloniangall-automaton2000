 Automaton2000: but do you know about it
 Andrew.Lee: So help me out here. I completed a Clash in 3:19, leaps ahead of the next person at 9:43. Yet I ranked 4th. How does the ranking work out?
 myNickName01: it's different per clash
 Jerrasterix: What type of clash
 myNickName01: speed and code size...
 myNickName01: are two different rankings
 myNickName01: also percent of tests
 Andrew.Lee: ah. code "size"... despite coding fastest, looks like I must shift+tab to remove all white spaces and comments
 myNickName01: in some clashes yes
 Andrew.Lee: that's pure crock.
 myNickName01: rofl, nice job on the speed though
 myNickName01:&#160;:)
 Andrew.Lee: C# vs Python. That's an unfair advantage
 Jerrasterix: That's useless in python or pascal other indented lang
 myNickName01: only thing I really have never liked about the clashes, is that everyone should be required to share all code, and if no one has 100% a solution should be shown
 Thorcode: What happend with Wontonimo mod badge?
 Wontonimo: Wave Function Collapse (rough draft) has been posted.  Yeah me.  It's been in the works for about 2 months
 myNickName01: otherwise i love this website, and clashes are my favorite thing on here
 Jerrasterix: wdym&#160;??
 Thorcode: try puzzle myNickName01
 Wontonimo: my badge may come back in the next reboot
 Thorcode: ah
 Thorcode: ko
 Jerrasterix: ahhh... server reboot 
 Thorcode: nah
 Jerrasterix: lucky Ebuth didn't get the mod back 
 Thorcode: I tried f5 it does not work
 Jerrasterix: server reboot, not a client reload 
 Jerrasterix: yesterday, CG chat server crashed it seems
 Thorcode: why lucky about eduth
 Thorcode: is he still a mod?
 Jerrasterix: well, he used to get it when server rebooted.. bcoz he was a mod
 Thorcode: what why he say that he was being banned
 Jerrasterix: idk
 camnwalter: is there a way to make it so i dont join a new chat room every game
 Schwase: no
 Jerrasterix: unfortunately np
 Schwase: just x out of them
 Jerrasterix: *ni
 Schwase: so close jerrasterix]
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: if i were a statistician, i would say you got the o\
 Jerrasterix: correcting a typo with a typo 
 Jerrasterix: what's 'o\'
 Jerrasterix: final try 
 Jerrasterix: **no
 Schwase: o\
 camnwalter: rip
 Schwase: lol
 Jerrasterix: does it mean "bye"&#160;??
 Qillio: hiiii
 Jerrasterix: hi Qillio
 Qillio: heyy
 Qillio: so what do you guys do here
 Qillio: are u guys students?
 camnwalter: ye
 Jerrasterix: most of us yeah
 Qillio: ooo
 camnwalter: i do clash of code bc im bored af
 Jerrasterix: we have clash of code, bot programming and puzzles
 Jerrasterix: you can chose what you like
 BartholomewIII: TIL, you can resize the test case and validator text boxes :P
 ArturWWL:  can i make private clash of code? 
 ZXC01: yes
 BartholomewIII: You can make a draft one that's not published, but you can't play it
 ZXC01: you can test it in ide
 ArturWWL: what do you mean i can't play it
 BartholomewIII: Unless, you mean a private room (only for friends)
 Andrew.Lee: fun. I now bested python coders with shortest C# code. Now I know how Clash of Code works.
 ArturWWL: yeah, that is what i mean, compare with my friend only
 Westicles: ZXC01 and Thorcode, what is your deal?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/77822323962071b4979d362739184d7efcae">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/77822323962071b4979d362739184d7efcae</a>
 ZXC01: deal?
 Westicles: don't approve crap
 ZXC01: just for fun
 ZXC01: and chen haos one of my friend
 Jerrasterix: He approved it 4 times :rofl:
 ZXC01: lol
 BartholomewIII: arturwwl, I don't know off hand how you can make a private room if at all, but you can invite them to a room when you are playing.
 Jerrasterix: do you clash of code page and scroll down
 Jerrasterix: *go
 Jerrasterix: There will be start a private clash button
 ArturWWL: chalalenge friend work one to one or with others?
 BartholomewIII: Or you click the three dots in the top right of CoC on this page: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 YoeriBoerema: hey guys, has anyone here done the Python foundation PCEP exam?
 YoeriBoerema: was wondering if anyone could give me some idea of how difficult it is 
 jacek: Automaton2000 did you?
 Automaton2000: so when i have enough time to be on cg
 Killuaa: hi
 CrownSRSS: hi
 Killer_Kat: hola
 ZD-xihuanMM: hello everyone
 ZXC01: hi
 nimseven7: hi
 Dreuyasha: what is the best resources for learning python? "Something fun"
 ZXC01: depends what you like
 Dreuyasha: i like clash of code but it's difficult
 Dreuyasha: im not actually learning anything
 ZXC01: hmm so fid the clashes you didnt solve after each clash and learn more bout it
 ZXC01: find*
 Dreuyasha: I'll take that advice, thanks
 ZXC01: :thumbup:
 Killer_Kat: You can also try making some projects of your own. That is how I learned the fundamentals. Simple stuff like can you make an app that lets you play rock paper scissors, a app that translates into simple cypher's, really anything could be an opportunity to learn something new and interesting.  
 Killer_Kat: I made a bunch of useless stuff <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Killer-Kat/What-The-Kat-Dragged-In">https://github.com/Killer-Kat/What-The-Kat-Dragged-In</a>
 Killer_Kat: One of the first things I ever did with python was try to make an app that would get the price of gold and convert it into the price of chicken nuggets. But it taught me a lot about web scraping.
 ZXC01: lol
 ZXC01: ==golden nuggets
 Killer_Kat: yup, I was thinking about what the conversion rate of gold nuggets to chicken nuggets would be
 Dreuyasha: hahaha ok thank you
 ZXC01: Hi, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: its really hard for me to get better at it
 ZXC01: at what?
 Killer_Kat: In case anyone is wondering at the current price of gold the conversion rate is about 1 to 152
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 what is the current rate of gold conversion?
 Automaton2000: half of the time though
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 , whats your rank?
 Automaton2000: haven't had time to implement
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 are you a bot?
 Automaton2000: if you want to get a working bot
 ZXC01: then how?
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 whats your country?
 Automaton2000: but not on cg at least
 ZXC01: whats cg?
 5DN1L: codingame
 ZXC01: is Automaton2000 better or is siri better?
 Automaton2000: then you have to learn a new language
 ZXC01: wait what?
 ZXC01: how come he is not answering any question
 ZXC01: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56eb7042-58dd-483c-a147-ded840605d81">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56eb7042-58dd-483c-a147-ded840605d81</a>
 ZXC01: wait sry accident
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 , spam the chat
 Automaton2000: how do i do it
 ZXC01: lol
 ZXC01: you need to output 100 line of random msg, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it is still a lot better
 ZXC01: Automaton , can you give me you're code?
 ZXC01: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: that's why i had to check if the other guy
 ZXC01: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yes, that was the best
 ZXC01: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i guess it will be good enough to get it to work i think
 ZXC01: Automaton2000, what are you working on?
 Automaton2000: i am not an expert
 ZXC01: you are desighned by an expert,Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: you dont really need to go to gold
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 How to go to gold in mad pod racing?
 Automaton2000: so it's not so much
 jacek: :unamused:
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 say hi
 Automaton2000: why would you want to use a search algorithm
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 say turtle
 Automaton2000: not sure if i am really confused
 Nikolaus_Hernando_NP: sket
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 give me some luck
 Automaton2000: i heard the same thing
 ZXC01: Automaton2000 check this replay  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/596042986">https://www.codingame.com/replay/596042986</a>
 Automaton2000: but is there a better way to do it
 ZXC01: How?
 Thyl: Hi&#160;!
 ZXC01: hi
 jacek: line racing? no tron?
 Thorcode: tron dead
 jacek: :scream:
 Ftyghi: hi
 Thorcode: even the old land ocupy
 Ftyghi: hi guys
 Ftyghi: its me ftyghi
 Ftyghi: long time no see
 Ftyghi: :grinning:
 Thorcode: who are you?
 ZXC01: who are you
 ZXC01: lol
 Ftyghi: did you forget me thorcode
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: who are you
 Ftyghi: :disappointed:
 ZXC01: are you new?
 Ftyghi: no i came 5 months ago
 Thorcode: Have I talked with you?
 Ftyghi: yes
 ZXC01: hmm
 ZXC01: never seen you before
 Thorcode: really
 Ftyghi: ZXC01 I don't know you to
 ZXC01: ok
 Thorcode: ah back to code has changed to time travelers
 ZXC01: cuz i came about 1 month ago
 Ftyghi: Yesssssssss
 Thyl: I have a problem with this main function
 Thyl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8b01b28-bc13-4c80-b2fe-c7edae6cda72">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8b01b28-bc13-4c80-b2fe-c7edae6cda72</a>
 Thyl: the code timout
 Thyl: it's for the labirynth
 ZXC01: ah labrinth
 ZXC01: i hate that
 Thorcode: are you real pythonner Thyl
 Thorcode: this seem like java
 Thyl: yes I am
 Thorcode: why your code seem like java
 ZXC01: thats c++
 ZXC01: dude
 ZXC01: cant you see cout?
 ZXC01: cin
 ZXC01: lolll
 ZXC01: or c
 ZXC01: or c#
 jacek: oO
 Thyl: no I can't ZXC01
 ZXC01:&#160;?
 Thyl: it's C++
 ZXC01: ooo
 Thyl: it timeout
 ZXC01: hmm
 ZXC01: its only a part right?
 Thyl: yes
 Thyl:  the rest is global variables and classes
 ZXC01: o
 ZXC01: im not so good in c++ loll
 Thorcode: my too
 Thorcode: *me
 ZXC01: but how come theres onlycout &lt;&lt; "RIGHT"
 5DN1L:     cin &gt;&gt; ROW &gt;&gt; COLUMN &gt;&gt; a; cin.ignore();
 5DN1L: You didn't define ROW and COLUMN?
 Thyl: no I define it
 Thyl: It doesn't do an error
 Thorcode: this code seem right
 5DN1L: You wrote:
 5DN1L:     int r; // number of rows.
 ZXC01: i think the whole code is needed
 5DN1L: can't see any ROW or COLUMN there
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: Thyl why don't you use python?
 ZXC01: hes sorta demifinalist
 artemidoris: c++ is better
 ZXC01: really?
 artemidoris: yes
 Thyl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2ba22dc-cbbb-4848-9904-cbe7ca1db77d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2ba22dc-cbbb-4848-9904-cbe7ca1db77d</a>

 Thyl: I select all the code :sweat_smile:
 Thorcode: I'm dead wwith that code
 artemidoris: if(c++ &gt; python) {	std::cout &lt;&lt; "true" &lt;&lt; std::endl;}
 artemidoris: true
 5DN1L:         for (int i = 0; i &lt; r; i++) {
 5DN1L: you use r here
 5DN1L: Make up your mind about ROW and r :laugh:
 Thyl: thanks
 Thyl: Thorcode python is cool
 Thyl: but C++ is faster
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: abit
 Thorcode: about time process out
 Thyl: a bit&#160;??
 Thyl: or 3*faster
 Thorcode: yeah about a few ms 
 Thyl: try to resolve Sokoban with python
 Thorcode: is that a puzzle on cg?
 Thyl: yes it is
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: solved it
 Thorcode: you solved it
 Thorcode: but not me
 Thorcode: I'm trying vox
 Pauloux: Where do we find the puzzle of the week pls&#160;?
 Thorcode: ah
 Thorcode: have you reach bronze or almost
 Thorcode: in algo path
 Pauloux: OK I see xD
 Thorcode: just click it
 Thorcode: prob solved XD
 Thorcode: what does x[2:] do?
 tryheadas: in list&#160;?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: probably
 Thorcode: nah I will figure it by my own
 Thorcode: thanks
 Thorcode: ah take the 2 first item
 eulerscheZahl: x[2:] takes all but the first two actually
 <b>**eulerscheZahl reads Sokoban</b></p><p><img src="/a/63052365393434" /> jacek: that copyrighted puzzle?
 jacek: hmm 16% success rate
 Thyl: eulerscheZahl wroye Sokoban&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i consider Sokoban as abandonware. it's so old and dozens of clones exist
 eulerscheZahl: i even made sure that the levels have the right copyright for me to use them. and the graphics too of course
 jacek: soon CG will be abandoware eh
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder has an optim contest soon
 InCog: hi for c#
 InCog: when printing 
 InCog: using Console.WriteLine
 InCog: can you only print 1 variable
 eulerscheZahl: you can build a string to print
 InCog: I cant print more than 1 out on the same line even with , 
 InCog: Oh
 InCog: so you must concatenate
 eulerscheZahl: Console.WriteLine($"{x} {y} {thrust}");
 InCog: Thanks
 InCog: Thats kind of disappointing know
 InCog: though*
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 InCog: idk I was expecting it to be like js
 InCog: so I kept trying for about 30 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: they are completely different languages. in return you get some features in C# that JS doesn't have
 InCog: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: like static typing
 eulerscheZahl: or integers
 InCog: what does static typing do
 InCog: I tried to read up on the basic premise of a lot of the things and I am gonna be super honest I dont understand them at all
 eulerscheZahl: let myVar = 'abc'myVar = 7
 InCog: oh 
 eulerscheZahl: valid JS code, won't work in C#
 InCog: yeah I get what you mean
 InCog: I know this is not the place to ask but what does the static void mean
 InCog: and string[] args
 InCog: I swear I have tried reading up and I have a general idea
 eulerscheZahl: static: you don't need an instance to call it
 eulerscheZahl: void: no return type
 eulerscheZahl: string[] args: the command line arguments provided to your application
 InCog: aight 
 InCog: string[] args refers to the command line dotnet run thing then?
 InCog: like the inputs
 InCog: in the command line
 jacek: ./program dupa 1 2 3
 jacek: args = ['dupa','1','2','3']
 InCog: oh aight
 jacek: dunno if .net will have args[0] = './program' as well
 InCog: thanks 
 eulerscheZahl: args[0] is not the program name itself
 Sayach8: static methods are callable at the class levels meaning they dont need objects to be called. void means they dont return anything. String[] args is a list of strings that hold command line arguments. the first value is the program name itself.(equivalent to argc and argv of C/C++)
 Sayach8: holds*
 jacek: there are 2 contridactory informations oO
 eulerscheZahl: information has no plural
 eulerscheZahl: 2 pieces of information
 eulerscheZahl: :nerd:
 jacek: :x
 Lynch[0]: hlw
 Sir_knight_Squirrel: hello
 Sayach8: looks like, neither C# nor Java saves the program name as the first argument. I guessed it would be the same as C/C++ or python's argv. But looks like it is not.
 eulerscheZahl: in C# you have things like Application.StartupPath 
 eulerscheZahl: or GetExecutingAssembly()
 Sayach8: Yeah, makes sense
 SilverOS: Code Breaker Puzzle.Is there someone know it?
 jacek: 22% that tried it, apparently
 truewulfey: glad to be in that 78%
 Bela575: Someone know when they will offer using C# 10 top level statements and global usings?
 Jerrasterix: unfortunately next year
 jacek: no c# codegolfing for you then
 Jerrasterix: I can understand top level statements, but global using&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: well, for code golfing we will need implicit usings not global usings
 Bela575: Then they can offer standard usings so you don't have to add to your code
 CIH: How does the promotion work in Mad Pod Racing? I've been above Boss 4 in Bronze League for two promotion rounds, but didn't get promoted to Silver. Should I just wait for it to happen eventually, or is there something I need to do?
 Bela575: yes implicit using was the right name!&#160;:-)
 jacek: if you submitted and youre above boss, you should be promoted automatically in the next 'window'
 jacek: you should see the timer above the viewer
 Jerrasterix: Urghh... there has been a report that promotion was not working this morning.
 jacek: ohh, friday deploy?
 Jerrasterix: probably, to save CG from the log4j bug :laughing:
 jacek: why would anyone use log4j instead of good old System.out.println()
 CIH: Ah, ok... I saw somebody else get promoted, or at least disappeared from the list above the boss.
 jacek: probably the issue will be fixed tomorrow
 CIH: yea, guess I'll just wait for tomorrow. Thanks guys!
 Jerrasterix: unfortunately, We have many developers who don't even know how to use it 
 Jerrasterix: you can't even see the list of maven dependencies in maven webpage, WTH&#160;?? 
 truewulfey: poor log4j
 eulerscheZahl: Your previous score in C# was 0%. You can try to improve this score by having another go at the C# CodinGame Certification.
 WoZniaKTV: bro what happended
 WoZniaKTV: im lvl 3 
 WoZniaKTV:&#160;:£
 truewulfey: sometimes i really wonder how i keep seeing the same people for over a year, always, at day, midday, night, evening, weekends and holidays
 WoZniaKTV: whats wrong about that
 truewulfey: nothing, just odd
 truewulfey: extremely, extremely odd
 truewulfey: not only that but their rankings dont really change
 WoZniaKTV: do you want to see different people all time?
 truewulfey: it would be more natural, yes, or at least see them being actual humans
 WoZniaKTV: when someone doesnt improve it's bad
 truewulfey: this way i cant decide if theyre robots or humans
 truewulfey: not to mention that they also seem to join multiple clashes at once
 Thorcode: guys solving puzzle in this site is so fun
 5DN1L: truewulfey the bots' profile pages state that they're bots
 WoZniaKTV: in clash someone before finished in like... 10 seconds
 Thorcode: yeah
 WoZniaKTV: and his code was like exec(bytes("牰湩⡴栧汥潬圠牯摬℡⤧","u16")[2:])
 WoZniaKTV: and it was 100% correct wtf
 Thorcode: ah that is for pythonner
 WoZniaKTV: it was exactly that, i saved it
 Thorcode: bruh
 WoZniaKTV: yep python 3
 Thorcode: I know
 Thorcode: what lang do you use?
 WoZniaKTV: mostly C#
 WoZniaKTV: and a little of Python
 WoZniaKTV: wbu
 Thorcode:&#160;%.3f what do this do in python?
 Thorcode: ah
 Thorcode: I know it
 jacek: i hope you dont use C# for code golfing and then complaining you lose&#160;:?
 WoZniaKTV:&#160;?
 WoZniaKTV: Is it possible to do that golfing thing with C# too?
 InCog: it is
 InCog: but 
 InCog: its not good for it
 InCog: use already have tons of wasted characters in the form of the initial stuff you need to include
 nitekat: is it possible to use C# for golfing? yes
 radioctiv: id never reccomend it
 nitekat: is it possible to use C# for golfing and win a lot? probably hard
 WoZniaKTV: i use C# just because it's the language i better know and understand
 WoZniaKTV: but of course i think some languages are better
 jacek: and you dont wear glasses
 WoZniaKTV: i do
 jacek: oO
 Dren: oh common
 Dren: I was literally beaten by exec(bytes()) bs
 Husoski: The Python encode hack?
 jacek: hack?
 jacek: oh my
 Husoski: I think hacking is a Covid symptom, too...&#160;:)
 jacek: .o
 WoZniaKTV: it isnt dw
 jacek: Automaton2000 is it dw
 Automaton2000: so nice to see you in legend yet?
 MSmits: hi guys
 MSmits: been busy
 jacek: oO
 jacek: MSmits come to othello, you need to outbook Nyanyan
 BlaiseEbuth: :smiley_cat::rainbow:
 MSmits: haha later maybe
 MSmits: want to try something fun?

 jacek: didi you solve c4?
 MSmits: I made a turtle-mnist. You can draw numbers and press spacebar to have the program guess it
 MSmits: (drag dot with mouse)
 MSmits: did not yet solve c4 no, it's still running
 MSmits: 139 million nodes
 MSmits: (max capacity 2B so i hope it solves before that)
 jacek: skynet will soon overtake the humanity <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/sfBmWhE.png">https://i.imgur.com/sfBmWhE.png</a>
 MSmits: aww damnit
 MSmits: it guesses my 3's pretty well
 MSmits: had 97% on MNIST set
 BlaiseEbuth: "Put Interactive Python Anywhere on the Web" sounds like a virus :scream:
 jacek: is it cnn?
 BlaiseEbuth: There's already js everywhere on the web, don't add python please...
 MSmits: it's 784 input pixels, then 200 hidden nodes to 10 output
 MSmits: very simple
 MSmits: the challenge is getting it to work on turtle, which is very limited
 jacek: oh my <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/x9lL2Nk.png">https://i.imgur.com/x9lL2Nk.png</a>

 jacek: did you use data augmentatoin
 MSmits: you can see the code
 MSmits: I just turn a black/white drawing to greyscale
 MSmits: I might be able to improve it
 MSmits: or do you mean training data&gt;
 MSmits: in that case no, i kept it real simple
 jacek: augmenting training data by adding samples - random rotations, clipping or noise
 jacek: and how much accuracy did you get
 MSmits: yeah that could be good, I would not do rotation, or a 6 becomes a 9&#160;:)
 MSmits: 97% 
 MSmits: on mnist pics
 BlaiseEbuth: What is this thing supposed to do?&#160;:/
 MSmits: you draw pictures by dragging the dot
 MSmits: then use spacebar
 MSmits: it tells you what number you drew
 MSmits: or tries to anyways
 jacek: i mean 5-20 degrees rotations. or translation
 MSmits: yeah that would help a lot
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah. The spacebar was the missing part
 MSmits: but 97% is already quite high, i think there may be something wrong with the way my drawn picture is turned into input
 jacek: its from scratch using numpy?
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: well that 0 or 1 should be obvious
 MSmits: cant use tensorflow in turtle
 MSmits: my 0's work ok
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yeah... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/nNGfUSN">https://imgur.com/a/nNGfUSN</a>
 MSmits: no they dont
 MSmits: i guess that was another trained versions where the 0s were good
 jacek: :smirk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/rff6dVN.png">https://i.imgur.com/rff6dVN.png</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Remind me reply challenge...
 MSmits: lol
 DomiKo: I believe you could improve your sigmoid function:
 DomiKo: it should be a lot faster
 jacek: i see you use only sigmoids. relu is simpler
 MSmits: yeah i was going by the mnist tutorial
 MSmits: dont you need sigmoids for output?
 MSmits: maybe relu for hidden
 MSmits: let me see if it works DomiKo
 MSmits: some simple stuff doesnt work in turtle
 MSmits: i should say in trinket
 jacek: yes, relu for hidden. sigmoid or softmax for output
 MSmits: it is not my bottleneck though, i should get 97% or better if someone draws a clear number
 MSmits: why else would i get that locally
 jacek: but if it has 97% acc then maybe making the inputs is faulty
 MSmits: yeah i think
 MSmits: so
 MSmits: I'll mess around with it a bit more. I like the visual part though
 Illedan: Hi 
 Illedan: Nice thing, but I can
 MSmits: hi Illedan
 Illedan: 't draw on it&#160;:/
 MSmits: drag the dot
 MSmits: you do need a keyboard
 MSmits: and mouse 
 MSmits: oh if you use the link with the code, you need to run first
 Illedan: ok
 Illedan: 3 = 7
 Illedan: great&#160;:)
 MSmits: haha 
 MSmits: damn it was doing a lot better for me
 MSmits: domiko didnt work. Said unsupported argument for x
 MSmits: numpy is only half-implemented i think
 MSmits: could not use load or save either
 DomiKo: that's sad&#160;:(
 MSmits: i had to do a file read and then set up my own splitting and such
 MSmits: possibly a paid version of trinket has  the full libraries, i am being cheap here
 jacek: you?
 jacek: :smirk:
 MSmits: yes indeed&#160;:)
 MSmits: I kinda think it's cool that it graded your penis jacek
 jacek: was it in training data?
 MSmits: no, mnist has no penises
 MSmits: though they have fashion-mnist too. If you want to, you can draw 40k penises and set up your own tutorial data-set
 MSmits: everyone needs a hobby
 jacek: welp today i made in keras cnn stuff, and put ttt samples and it worked. im tweaking numbers of layers and kernels
 MSmits: ordinary ttt?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: those 5478 samples with w/d/l
 MSmits: oh ok, i thought that one was hard to use as a real test because it memorizes. But yeah for debugging it seems great
 jacek: it memorizes, that is loss near 0, but still requires quite a number of kernels
 MSmits: and you have only 1 cell with a full set of neighbors
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: i mean cnn uses filters right?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: generally the edges are exceptions
 MSmits: you have 8 edges and 1 normal cell
 jacek: i used padding, zeroes around the 3x3 squares
 MSmits: oh i see
 jacek: apparently what a0 and lc0 use
 jacek: makes sense so it knows about boundaries
 MSmits: yeah ok
 jacek: so you havent seen this week's potw?
 MSmits: nope havent logged in for 2 weeks or more
 MSmits: oh nmm
 MSmits: still have to finish it
 MSmits: my solver
 MSmits: I have the whole index function and such done and can solve 3v3, but it has so many endgame book sizes that it's cumbersome to set up, more so than oware.
 MSmits: this one you can actually completely solve though
 jacek: i read 3v3 has about 60k positions?
 MSmits: very few, sounds about right 
 MSmits: 8x8 has more positions than 9x9
 MSmits: because it's actually 8x8x8 vs 9x9x6
 MSmits: the last one being empties
 jacek: i win mostly by blocking
 MSmits: yeah seems like that is very important. If you make a value function that just counts pieces it's extremely weak
 MSmits: oh I think i know whats wrong with my mnist program. I just did 10 in a row, all correct, but if i draw too small it guesses wrong
 MSmits: so it might be the scale
 UZUHAMA: Hello world

 jude2k: Encryption/Decryption of Enigma Machine question: Anybody knows  if you have an "N" of 7 and the letter of the string is close to the end of the alphabet, do you start over with the counting?

 Schwase: maybe idk if thats a thing actually
 Wontonimo: well, it's (most likely) official.  I've got a hater.  On my last 3 community posted puzzles I've gotten 1 downvote right away after publishing, then just upvotes, and they trickle in slowly after that.    I don't know who I cheesed off, but let it me known there isn't anyone here I don't like.
 Wontonimo: Hey MSmits, it's been a while!  How are you?
 C26_1: So I've researched for a while and discovered that French is diverged from English 
 C26_1: Let me show you

 C26_1: So if the noun isn't have any gender word then it'll be seen as male object
 C26_1: Communication is important in programming
 C26_1: So this topic doesn't offside anyway
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: This is just the beginning
 C26_1: A sentence can changed its meaning if we change the tone at each word (or another word: stress)
 C26_1: I forgot it
 ganbat24: yo
 ganbat24: how do you even get recruited on this site
 C26_1: What
 C26_1: ganbat24, wdym?
 ganbat24: like what are the things i need to do 
 ganbat24: seems the certification system is bs since evereone has &gt;99%
 C26_1: I have talked more about it in discord
 C26_1: Feel free to watch
 AguliRojo: Everyone? Its better to apply by yourself by any means. Good offers coming to you are a rarity.
 AguliRojo: But either way &gt;99% is impressive. That is without cheating :wink:
 DialFrost: nah its quite easy if u know the language
 DialFrost: the problems arent that hard
 DialFrost: unless ur not *very* familar with the language then you might not know how to do certain things

 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: you could thanks to on board too
 Mortis_666: who is on board
 ZXC01: lol its a game that give you all the answer to all languages
 Mortis_666: hmm
 Aquajag: in python, i have a string of unknown length, that i want to break into a series of 8 character long strings. is there a simple method for this?
 Aquajag: another way to put it, i want to insert a specific character every 8 spaces. 
 Aquajag: i feel like there must be a simple way but it's eluding me
 Mortis_666: u mean like1234567890123456to 12345678    90123456?
 Aquajag: yes.
 Aquajag: if i use a for loop to step through the string i can find every 8th spot. but then i only know how to change that spot to a space, not how to add a space there without altering the existing value. 
 liferocks: step through it in slices of length 8, building another string as you go for your output
 Mortis_666: my way to do this is make an empty string and an empty list then loop through the unknown string , append a char to the empty string, check if the string is now having len 8, if yes append the string to the empty list and make the string empty again
 Aquajag: thanks, those ideas helped
 Wontonimo: another way is like thisimport numpy as npa = np.array( the_text )a = a.reshape([-1,8])
 Wontonimo: now a[0] is the first 8a[1] is the second 8etc
 Aquajag: ok... i'd like to understand that. can you point me to a page that would teach that? or, what am i looking up? eg what's numpy lol
 ZXC01: numpy is something you can import lolll
 ZXC01: like import math and sys
 Aquajag: aaaaah
 Wontonimo: yeah, there is this tool you can use to search for things online. I think it is called doogle or goodle or something like that.  then you put in the search term like "what is numpy , i see it in python code"
 Aquajag: so it treats arrays a bit differently?
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Thorcode: it is libary
 Thorcode: python has a lot of libary
 Aquajag: fair enough wontonimo. though in your text example i thought numpy was a weird variable name you preferred.
 Wontonimo: i hope you don't mind the ribbing.  it's all in good fun.
 Wontonimo: yes, indeed it is a library, and with python you can rename the libraries you import
 Wontonimo: so that if two people call their library the same thing you can give them different names in your code
 Wontonimo: numpy is really awesome for array manipulation 
 Aquajag: so in your example, could you just say import numpya = numpy.array...........
 Wontonimo: YEAH!  you got it
 Aquajag: so if i'm writing a short thing is there any reason to do the "import as" you did? is that just a habit/convention?
 Thorcode: or you could just google for python libaries
 Aquajag: yes i can google things. and i am. but that still requires i know what i'm looking for. what i really need is, like, a book for learning python. like, something for dummies... if only there was such a thing in print somewhere...
 Westicles: There is an easier way to Babylon tower
 Aquajag: this site is good for learning what i don't know, but learning the thing itself requires doing elsewhere
 Wontonimo: hey Aquajag - this may be good exercise (not a book) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>

 TinyKitten: sup
 Mr_BlueBird: hi
 DavidDeLord: is it just me or are the test cases for most of the clash of code problems awful?
 BlaiseEbuth: You're not so awful...
 Alihussain: CAN ANYONE BEAT ME
 Westicles: DavidDeLord, recent approvals get more play, and they are indeed awful
 nothansk: hi friends!!
 nothansk: hi tinykitten!!!
 DarkPhoenixBoi: yo i have a question
 DarkPhoenixBoi: what is "process has timed out " means? my code worked for all test cases except for the one with so many inputs
 Bbaaii: that means that your code is inefficient 
 Phurinat: Your code is too slow, you should look to optimize it. Maybe in your loop
 DarkPhoenixBoi: oh OK thanks guys now i get it &lt;3
 shionjee: hi
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hi is there anychange in how server run validate
 MiyamuraIzumi: most of my randomize algorithm return different result with the same seed&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: my seed in optimize game actually
 eulerscheZahl: do you have some kind of (while time &lt; xx) tryRandom()?
 MiyamuraIzumi: ofcourse yes
 eulerscheZahl: to be deterministic, you have to use a fixed number of simulations
 eulerscheZahl: you won't get the very same number of iterations. you won't get the same number offline on your PC either
 MiyamuraIzumi: you are right, I ain't think about that
 MiyamuraIzumi: it is just that I used to get the same result with same seed
 MiyamuraIzumi: but now it is gone&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MiyamuraIzumi execution time varies a bit, depends on server machine i guess
 MiyamuraIzumi: I just try my old code
 MiyamuraIzumi: I will keep my old rank then :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eh, never give up
 Westicles: Anyone done Cross the Lines puzzle?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not I
 Westicles: Not sure how to approach it. 
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/8kUNhS6">https://imgur.com/a/8kUNhS6</a>
 MiyamuraIzumi: then don't approach it
 Westicles: If 69 people can do it then I can do it
 Westicles: I guess maybe you look for polygons then even/odd number of sides
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u could easily beat me at connect4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least until i finish my bitboarding
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)

 Calimero90: hi all&#160;! I've done test in Javascript and  now I aim in Java... How to return in Javascript now&#160;?? Don't found it&#160;!! Tk
 nickeyminasj: u cannot return it now u have to learn java to continue
 Calimero90: how&#160;? cant find menu or buton for this&#160;!
 Uljahn: there should be a drop-down menu atop of your code
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a dropdown list at the top of the IDE.
 Calimero90: ha ok. So I have to go in puzle to chose.. Ok and Tank&#160;!
 Calimero90: *thank

 derjack: oO
 Tedylazar: hello
 RobertPamfiloiu: helloo
 RobertPamfiloiu: how are you?
 ableflyer: how do you write int(i) for i in input().split()] using stub generator input
 ableflyer: anyone?
 Saajith: hi
 ableflyer: how do you say input().split() but in stub generator
 nothansk: what is stub generator
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't.
 BlaiseEbuth: The stub generator is 'generic' what your asking for does not exist in all languages.
 BlaiseEbuth: Read the doc.

 BlaiseEbuth: thanveershah, no, I realy don't see the link between all the numbers between 1 and 9 except 6 and 6... :thinking:
 Nekko551XD: missing digit
 nothansk: oh bruh nice
 LazyMammal: puzzle of the week is nice. can be done in ~ 1 hour.
 LazyMammal: Does anyone have the link for lookup up CoC puzzles?  I want to avoid duplicate submission.
 nothansk: where do i find puzzle of the week
 japrozs: hi
 japrozs: hi
 japrozs: hi
 japrozs: hi
 japrozs: hi
 KiwiTae: took me 10min :p i liked it though
 nothansk: Kiwi where is puzzle of the week
 KiwiTae: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/connect-the-hyper-dots">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/connect-the-hyper-dots</a>
 KiwiTae: ^ nothansk
 nothansk: thank you
 simone33: hi
 nothansk: how do you even do this&#160;:(
 LazyMammal: Orthant is like Quadrant in more dimensions.  No biggie.
 japrozs: hi
 japrozs: hi
 japrozs: hi
 KiwiTae: BlaiseEbuth ^ you got another one for lunch
 BlaiseEbuth: That's gluttony...
 ableflyer: how can i make an array using stub generator
 BlaiseEbuth: Have you even read the doc?
 ableflyer: i did
 ableflyer: but nothing mentioned a list
 ableflyer: i read it like 3 times
 BlaiseEbuth: So you suppose there's things that are not mentioned in the doc but still possibles?
 ableflyer: maybe?
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 ableflyer: oh
 ableflyer: i tried loopline z z:int but it doesn't work
 BlaiseEbuth: The purpose of the stub generator is to provide the basic structure of code to read the inputs. Not to store them.
 BlaiseEbuth: You can check every puzzle or multi, when there's loops reading inputs, the base code does not include arrays or lists. It just have a simple variable that is overwritten each turn
 ableflyer: ok thanks

 Uljahn: or ML2 optimization
 LazyMammal: True, there is achievement for having 400L fuel in ML2 validation test case 5.

 valerawr: new joiner her
 valerawr: here*, hello
 LazyMammal: welcome
 kostis14: really nice contribution @LazyMammal 
 LazyMammal: thx!
 snoyes: LazyMammal: In your contribution's sample code, checking a span up to 10 may be overkill. The span seems to be either 1 or 2 for all values of C well into the tens of millions
 snoyes: (I was trying to find a value for which your brute force approach would time out, 'cause that's the way I roll)
 LazyMammal: Thanks for checking.  Flaaamort provided a directly solution that seems to imply the same.  My brute force solution was due to ignorance :D
 Flaaamort: Yep, I can prove that the span is 1 for odd c and 2 for even c, for all c.
 kyoya34: hello
 kyoya34: anyo?

 LazyMammal: hello? &lt;Adele singing ...&gt;"is this thing on?"
 Wontonimo: you'll thank me
 Electroxd988: sup
 Wontonimo: yeah, nice contribution LazyMammal.  I upvoted
 LazyMammal: Thanks. It still needs work. The feedback has been very useful to sort out the corner cases.

 KP56: who has finished this challenge? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-the-hyper-dots">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-the-hyper-dots</a>
 LazyMammal: I liked this puzzle of the week.  I had to look up "Orthant" but the rest was straight forward.
 KP56: i have a question
 KP56: why is there a space after a colon in test case #10
 KP56: since there is still an a on this position: a 14 -2 -4 9
 KP56: which i believe is the same orthant
 LazyMammal: what are the vector coords of previous letter and letter you are asking about?
 KiwiTae: criss-cross, ['-', 8, -5, -1, 6] ['-', 1, -1, -1, 1]criss-cross, a ['-', 9, 1, 3, 8] ['-', 1, 1, 1, 1]
 KiwiTae: thats why
 KiwiTae: 2coordinates cahnging sign
 LazyMammal: +/- signs don't change (or it is zero) thus same orthant
 LazyMammal: yep, if they do change (not zero) then orthant changed
 KP56: a 14 -2 -4 9
 KP56: , 8 -5 -1 6
 KP56: same orthant
 LazyMammal: yes!
 KP56: isn't this a meant to be in a "sauce" word?
 KiwiTae: KP56 u got the wrong a
 KP56: oh
 KP56: but there should be no 'a' in the same orthant as ','
 KP56: so how does that make sense
 KiwiTae: u go to the closest point 
 KiwiTae: thats it no need to check for pts in same orthant
 KP56: yes but there is a space only when going to a different orthant and the 'a' and the ',' are seperated
 KP56: i think im just too dumb for this
 KiwiTae: find the nearest point, and then the nearest unused point from that point, and so on until all points have been connected.
 KiwiTae: u got a list of points 
 KiwiTae: u start from origin
 KiwiTae:  Ã©
 KiwiTae: just get the closest point till the list is empty
 KP56: dont worry i understand these basics, everything works except for the case #10
 KiwiTae: criss-cross, a ['-', 9, 1, 3, 8]  should be where u land
 KP56: thank you for trying to help, ill have a look at it again tomorrow maybe i will understand at that time
 LazyMammal: KP56 you are so close. Good luck tomorrow.
 KP56: i think i figured it out Kiwi sent me his entire debug
 KP56: what i did wrong is i would iterate through every orthant seperately
 LazyMammal: Oh sure.  When I did it, I separately compared each pair of numbers at each position in the two vectors.
 LazyMammal: If *any* pair doesn't match sign, then it's a new Orthant.
 KP56: fortunetly the way i implemented it makes it very simple to reformat

 jacek: Oo
 jacek: reCurse do you use pitting in your totozero?
 jacek: i thought the difference between alphago zero and alphazero is that there is not pit and nn is updated regardless
 codeing: blaiseEbuth why you ban me from france channel&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: I didn't
 codeing: you ok&#160;?
 Marchete: do you use pitting jacek?
 jacek: no
 Marchete: then you just create selfplays from your last training?
 jacek: i have chart current nn vs baseline as sanity check after each iteration but thats it
 jacek: yes
 jacek: dunno if its better or worse than pitting
 Marchete: I sometimes went downhill
 Marchete: like one iteration having 7% winrate
 jacek: the chart shows some regression, but it is improvement over time
 jacek: 7%? i think i never had that drastic regression
 Marchete: well, that's an extreme case
 Marchete: but I see this too:

 jacek: :upside_down:
 codeing: its for Ebuth
 codeing: sorry

 codeing: moderator that ban anybody&#160;?
 codeing: don't nee to stay moderator
 darkhorse64: people that do not behave have no place here.
 nuggetbucket54: L
 ChargedParticle:  whats going on in here?
 nuggetbucket54: idk some people are getting mad and some people are trolling 
 ChargedParticle: ah ok
 ChargedParticle: then i'll stay away
 nuggetbucket54: lol good idea
 jacek: yeah, trolling is very bad
 fvla: imagine if codingame could actually optimize tail call recursions lol
 fvla: no but seriously, i swear that they have C++ on options for zero optimization
 jacek: for c++ use #pragma things
 fvla: i wish we could set them up ourselves
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"
 jacek: add that to first lines
 fvla: oh, thanks!
 fvla: this makes me pretty angry, just discovering this
 fvla: i actually could have used this in spring challenge :P
 jacek: :shrug_tone1:
 DavidDeLord: are macros allowed?
 DavidDeLord: expecially for clash of code
 jacek: anything is allowed within language syntax
 DavidDeLord: i meant like input macros
 DavidDeLord: press a keyboard shortcut to include bits/stdc++.h
 jacek: oh. i dont know
 fvla: you could just copy/paste a bunch of preprocessor macros? unless that's unallowed
 Marchete: extreme lazyness
 DavidDeLord: for some contests people have these HUGE macro sheets
 DavidDeLord: like these: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gist.github.com/kodekracker/e09f9d23573f117a5db0">https://gist.github.com/kodekracker/e09f9d23573f117a5db0</a>
 jacek: O:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: o:q
 Marchete: :O
 Marchete: include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
 DavidDeLord: BuT iTs NoN sTaNdArD
 fvla: please never use it in an actual project
 fvla: not because of the portability, but for build time
 DavidDeLord: fvla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header</a>
 fvla: i was referring to bits/stdc++.h
 Marchete: I use it on every and all projects
 Marchete: in CG
 struct: main reason I dont use it its because its a gcc thing
 struct: Cant use it on vs&#160;:(
 AllYourTrees: whats vs?
 lectr1c: visual studio

 GreenPineapple: Has anyone tried this puzzle yet? "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/divisibility-of-fibonacci-numbers-sum">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/divisibility-of-fibonacci-numbers-sum</a>" I am failing to optimize around the 5 digit mark&#160;:/ 
 LazyMammal: Not yet, but looks interesting.
 BobLob: What are you trying to optimize?  Generating the number from the sequence?
 Westicles: that one is tricky
 KiwiTae: GreenPineapple theres a trick to get it
 KiwiTae: can find in the fibonacci properties 
 fvla: GreenPineapple hint: exponentiation is achievable in linear time in terms of the exponent
 Husoski: @GreenPineapple I'm doing this one now, pure Python or bust.  If you read the rest of the Wikipedia article (link in problem statement) there's some useful info.
 Wontonimo: Hey Marchete, I saw a link to your write up on OwareZero.  The link was to page 2 and for some reason I thought that was the whole write up and I though it was great
 Wontonimo: then i saw you had several pages of awesome detail.  It's a fabulous write up!
 Wontonimo: Thanks so much for sharing
 Wontonimo: Westicles, did you do the divisible fibonacci puzzle?
 Westicles: yeah
 Westicles: You need to find two large values in the fib sequence to solve.  There is a log2(N) alg for finding them
 fvla: by log2(n) you mean by the size of n or the number n itself?
 Westicles: the nth term
 fvla: ok
 TheBigBadMaster_164: hello, did anyone solve the lucky numbers of 6s and 8s with Java?
 Husoski: Yay! Got "Divisibility of Fibonacci number sum" ...100% on first clean compile!
 Husoski: ...and no numpy!
 Plantchant: I'm now realizing how inefficient Lua is

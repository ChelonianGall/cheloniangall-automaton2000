 struct: 1k is how much&#160;% gain? YurkovAS
 AntiSquid: i feel like you just need more ifs not rollouts
 Wontonimo: I gained a few ranks in SC2021 since the competition without doing anything.  Odd.
 YurkovAS: struct in local only tested, wins: left=54%, right=57%.4+ hours i'm find bugs&#160;:)

 Mai-Lapyst: hi
 BoBot: Hey BoBot,
 BoBot: haha wat :D
 BoBot: haven't heard that name in a while
 aCat: nice, congratz&#160;;]
 BoBot: leaderboard flux? :D is that game like...2 years old?
 BoBot: have not touched it meanwhile
 derjack: see? you dont need to do anything to promote, just wait some time. ezpz
 BoBot: haha over 4 years ago
 BoBot: omg, seems less time ago...time flies
 XprophEtX: guys, can u tell me how I can read the game options (like current seed) in my code? are thos env variables?
 aCat: no you cant
 XprophEtX: oh ok, thanks!
 Sooran: Everyone, is Kotlin working properly?
 derjack: hmm there were some issues over the weekend
 Sooran: Problems solved by kotlin do not pass the validator.:rage:
 RoboStac: yeah, thibaud said they were still looking at kotlin issues on discored
 RoboStac: the latest version is causing a lot of problems
 Notter: Why do I keep disconnecting at random intervals?
 Westicles: The update seems to have broken my c# golfs
 Westicles: Unhandled exception. System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (2): No such file or directoryat System.Diagnostics.Process.ForkAndExecProcessat System.Diagnostics.Process.StartCoreat System.Diagnostics.Process.Start
 Westicles: Seems that ruby -e no longer works unless you put the whole path /usr/local/bin/ruby.  Actually takes a little bit of the cheat out of golf, which is good
 Westicles: Does golf ever get recalculated? 
 struct: I think it happened before
 KalamariKing: What was the ruby trick?
 Westicles: Run ruby from other languages
 KalamariKing: Why would you want that
 struct: for codegolf
 struct: there is per language rating
 KalamariKing: Oh ok
 KalamariKing: Also is there a limit or smth on JavaScript exponents? on a clash where the answer is the input squared, JavaScript users are failing one of the tests (specifically the 'crash test')
 RoboStac: javascript  doesn't have ints so uses doubles for calculation by default (won't be accurate above 2**53)
 KalamariKing: Ah ok thanks
 Notter: Why do I keep getting disconnected at random intervals?
 struct: Can it be your connection?
 Neglokit: i can't do any of the puzzles
 Neglokit: where is a good place to start
 Neglokit: for a beginner
 KalamariKing: Well what language do you wanna start with
 KalamariKing: I like clashes, personally
 KalamariKing: btw
 struct: clashes are not the place to start
 struct: Neglokit this site is not meant for beginners
 struct: you need a little bit of experience
 KalamariKing: Oh lol that's where I started, but yeah its not for learning or anything
 Neglokit: o
 Neglokit: i'm leaning python 3
 Neglokit: learning
 KalamariKing: Python is popular, there's plenty of tutorials and learning experiences online
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers">https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers</a>
 Neglokit: where do you recommend for a free tutorial
 Neglokit: but in depth
 Neglokit: nvm
 Neglokit: ty struct

 Notter: Is Java good?
 Mai-Lapyst: how do you define "good"? in terms of syntax, ecosystem, speed, portability...
 KalamariKing: Notter it all depends on what you want to do
 KalamariKing: Ik, bad answer, but its true
 Notter: The More You Know
 yassine_Benlahbib: hi
 Notter: Hello
 Luj8n: No, Java is bad (:
 derjack: kree java!
 yassine_Benlahbib: you should try C 
 Notter: Strings in C are confusing
 yassine_Benlahbib: that's the point 
 yassine_Benlahbib: strings in python are waaay easier
 Luj8n: bruh, there are no strings in C
 yassine_Benlahbib: i told you you should try C
 Mai-Lapyst: i like C strings. they are fairly simple once you wrap your had around it. and very powerfull to, like builtin string view support
 Mai-Lapyst: *head
 AndersE: Every language are good if used in the right context. Don't say a language is good or bad. Look at the problem and the environment it has to be in. 
 Luj8n: Java is bad in every way&#160;:)
 Mai-Lapyst: but its still the most protable language on the planet
 Mai-Lapyst: java runs literally on coffeemachines
 Luj8n: but jokes aside, any language is good if you know how to use it
 Notter: I'm currently trying to get the hang of python classes and objects
 AndersE: And I have been programming for over 30 years. Language  is now only a way to express oneself. And all languages has its own advantages and disadvantages.
 dreadylein: agree, except perl because doh :D 
 KalamariKing: perl is gross
 AndersE: Haha, that one is sort of true. You can write readable code in perl, but people tend to write as "fancy and short" code as possible that no one can understand.
 Greg_3141: It's fun to hate on Java but at the end of the day it's a solid language for large projects
 aCat: someoune asked for C#?
 BlaiseEbuth: Wowow! Too much troll on this chan...
 aCat: *someone
 AntiSquid: that's why some companies are rewriting their apps in Kotlin, because it works even better
 derjack: kotlin is just another lang for jvm :thinking:
 KalamariKing: What are the major differences between kotlin and java
 KalamariKing: to me, there doesn't seem to be much
 KalamariKing: or maybe I'm blending c#/java/js/etc into one pseudo-syntax and kotlin is too similar... idk
 Greg_3141: kotlin doesn't try to look like C
 derjack: kotlin is most present in android where youre stuck on java7 or pseudo java8
 KalamariKing: So its like a faster/modernized java
 Greg_3141: honestly though, if you're going to use Kotlin instead of Java, why not just go directly to Scala?
 KalamariKing: java-lite
 BlaiseEbuth: Comparing attentively two turds, you can find differences. But at the end it's just shit...
 AndersE: Didn't do anything with Java for over 5 years. Now thrown in into project that make use of Java RX. Any thoughts on Java RX. Ok, it's a framework, but a completely different way to do things.
 derjack: there is quite a trend to make oop lannguages more functional
 AndersE: Agree
 Greg_3141: there's not much wrong with Java, surprisingly enough it's usable even for high performance code
 BlaiseEbuth: What a mess... If you want to do functional, use a real functional language...
 Darkboy: Im still in Bash
 BlaiseEbuth: Greg is a high performance troll :p
 Greg_3141: nothing wrong with having multiple paradigms
 BlaiseEbuth: Medium everywhere, good nowhere...
 AntiSquid: the syntax is quite different too
 Greg_3141: And yet lots of competent programmers choose it
 AntiSquid: KalamariKing how the hell can you confuse c# java and js&#160;??? 
 KalamariKing: my guy
 KalamariKing: its been a while
 AntiSquid: JS is more straight forward
 AntiSquid: and C# has its own magic
 Greg_3141: confusing c# and java is forgivable, you can copy paste code from one to the other with very minor modifications
 AntiSquid: diff libs for both, depends on project
 KalamariKing: by now its all just one large clusterf*ck of characters
 AntiSquid: what are you usually doing Greg_3141&#160;?
 Greg_3141: hobby shit
 BlaiseEbuth: Gold league with depth1 search
 Greg_3141: yes
 AntiSquid: hah ok do Fall Challenge 2020 with depth1 search and get gold, would like to see :D
 AntiSquid: is UTTT gold doable with depth1 search&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't know. Perhaps with one or two ifs.
 Greg_3141: maybe if you had a good heuristic function?
 KalamariKing: Is something wrong with cg rn?
 KalamariKing: Running code returns "oops a system error has occurred" and I'm not sure if thats specific to this game of not
 KalamariKing: or*
 Greg_3141: doesn't happen for me
 StevensGino: I think it is your code's problem
 KalamariKing: Everyone in this clash has the same problem
 Greg_3141: I don't care that much about CoC so idk
 StevensGino: which language should I learn for CoC&#160;?
 Greg_3141: python probably
 StevensGino: currently I know C++/Java
 StevensGino: thanks
 Greg_3141: python is good for writing code quickly, but there might be an even better language for CoC
 AntiSquid: but CoC isn't a life goal
 BlaiseEbuth: Even not a goal...
 StevensGino: yes, I just play CoC to relax
 MrFruit: I am getting a "Oops... a system error has occurred!" 
 StevensGino: or wram up
 MrFruit: And seems like everyone in my clash as well
 MrFruit: Arrr, its gone now.
 KalamariKing: Do clashes get re-evalled
 StevensGino: btw, is there any advantage on Rust over C++ for bot programming contest?
 Greg_3141: yeah, let me write it up
 Notter: Why can't I face my bot against itself?
 Greg_3141: You can
 Mai-Lapyst: @StevensGino one big advantage is you dont have to worry about lifetime's and scopes. malloc() rules, but it can also very fast produce segfaults...
 Greg_3141: A nice thing about Rust is how you can easily represent several different types of moves with an enum. 
 StevensGino: thank you two
 Greg_3141: You can also iterate over moves more easily because Rust has better support for iterators and closures iirc
 therealbeef: that sounds like features C++ has too&#160;:-/
 Mai-Lapyst: yes thats true, c has no real support for iterators. c++ has
 casmith789: C++ is a great generalist language, you will be able to do everything you want in C++. But the syntax might be a little clunky so it will just be ease of use other languages have over it
 Greg_3141: In Rust, you can easily build up a complex iterator from several more basic iterators using map() and chain()
 StevensGino: I already know C++ (not really master it), I just hesitate should I learn Rust for bot programming
 Greg_3141: and other iterator functions as needed
 casmith789: I would say learn it if you find it interesting
 Greg_3141: pattern matching in Rust is really nice for simplifying casework (think different types of moves in a game)
 StevensGino: thank you all, learning a new programming language is always satisfying
 StevensGino: so I will learn Rust
 derjack: :scream:
 CodeLoverboy: Hello!
 Greg_3141: hello
 CodeLoverboy: Is there any way you can make your own game?
 Greg_3141: yeah
 derjack: codingame sdk?
 MSmits: CodeLoverboy i would not recommend creating your own game here if you havent created a few good bots first. 
 MSmits: Not every game is a good bot game
 MSmits: unless you're straight up porting something that's known to be a good bot game
 MSmits: (like a classic)
 derjack: :soccer:
 MSmits: like paper soccer yes :P
 MSmits: why is pony upside down?
 derjack: maybe hes in australia :upside_down:
 MSmits: I see, makes sense
 CodeLoverboy: who?
 MSmits: he wasnt upside down before
 CodeLoverboy: in alustalia?
 CodeLoverboy: ok 
 MSmits: people in alustalia aren't upside down
 CodeLoverboy: grammaly
 CodeLoverboy: jk
 CodeLoverboy: im just joking around
 MSmits: go tit
 MSmits: got it
 Mobilex1122: hi
 StevensGino: is there any CPs on solving community problem?
 struct: no
 StevensGino: thanks 
 BlaiseEbuth: On puzzles, comunity or not.
 MSmits: StevensGino the idea is that stuff that is competitive gives cp
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 MSmits: should be called competition points tbh
 StevensGino: so if it is community competive, should I have CPs?
 derjack: or something not c* points, the abbreviation is meh
 derjack: depends if you want to be competetive
 MSmits: StevensGino yes mostly, you could consider solving puzzles competitive, but it's not really. 
 StevensGino: for example&#160;:
 StevensGino: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess/leaderboard</a>
 MSmits: yeah thats cp worthy
 StevensGino: can I have CPs for this?
 derjack: yes
 StevensGino: thank you all&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course not MSmits, that would not be representative of 95% of the community...
 MSmits: but not an easy way to get many points because botgames with &lt; 500 players have a reduced cp maximum
 derjack: but youll get more CPs from more popular games and if youre higher in leagues
 MSmits: also those small population games have a higher fraction of hard core botters
 StevensGino: thanks, I didn't even think of it
 MSmits: btw, did not understand what you meant there BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: MSmits 03:37PMshould be called competition points tbh
 MSmits: mmh i meant that "coding" could be anything on this site, so calling it coding points is misleading
 MSmits: it's all coding
 MSmits: solving a puzzle is coding too
 BlaiseEbuth: I know, just trolling. :3
 MSmits: ahh ok
 derjack:  
 MSmits: i think the experience points could rightly be called coding points
 MSmits: because everything gives experience
 MSmits: though community multies give very little
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm. Xp is not misleading, and is a classic designation for this kind of points.
 BlaiseEbuth: But I agree on coding points.
 MSmits: yeah thats true. it's not misleading
 MSmits: but you could call it coding points and it would still not be misleading
 BlaiseEbuth: Right.
 BlaiseEbuth: But if (in an alternative world) a change was made on the CP name, renaming XP -&gt; CP will be misleading.
 MSmits: true
 Uljahn: practice points and competition points seems clear though
 MSmits: yeah
 Breem: Hey guys
 MSmits: it's weird that re curse made the chess multi, but his bot is not on there. For a community multi it's not doing badly with 102 submissions. It's not easy to write a bot for it
 reCurse: It's not weird, I told you why :P
 MSmits: is this because you are afraid of being sucked into the black hole that is chess?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: ah ok, i remember now
 MSmits: well then it is weird that you created the multi :P
 reCurse: Hm
 MSmits: though if you did it to do the CG community a favor, then thats a good reason
 reCurse: I'd say my hobbies are weird so there's that
 MSmits: sure that's fine too :P
 reCurse: I think I wanted to do at least one contribution
 MSmits: ah, good choice then
 reCurse: I often get those urges to try things at least once
 reCurse: I also had my half-finished game that would take too much effort to complete
 reCurse: Chess is super easy in comparison
 MSmits: this was a game that was supposed to become a contest, like what euler did?
 reCurse: Streaming was such a completely impulsive case
 reCurse: I think it would have made a very fine contest yes
 reCurse: I wanted that to be a motivation to finish it
 reCurse: And well...
 MSmits: ah, too bad
 reCurse: Now even without the drama I'm not sure CG would have wanted that
 reCurse: But shrug
 MSmits: there is usually a risk to creating new things
 reCurse: It was an almost frame perfect Puyo Puyo Tsu clone in case you wonder
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: struct would have loved that
 reCurse: I'd have called it "Smash Tsu Code" hehe
 MSmits: I'm working on a simple TTT implementation to practice ML on. This is like my 4th completely new implementation of TTT in python. There's a ridiculous number of ways to do this
 reCurse: I still think TTT is a bad test bed
 MSmits: yeah, you might be right, but it doesnt have to work well, just as to work so i have some familiar thing to work with
 MSmits: i'm matching ply 1 state to ply 0 state as a target
 derjack: admit it, you created chess to complete quest map
 reCurse: There's a quest for making a multi?
 struct: The person could drop a piece per frame?
 reCurse: Not necessarily
 MSmits: reCurse probably a quest for community contribution in general
 MSmits: could be a puzzle
 reCurse: I did frame counting of all actions
 derjack: or clash
 reCurse: So the frame at which you can drop a piece, the bot gets a turn
 reCurse: So you could get multiple turns in a row if the opponent is completing a long chain
 reCurse: The game's whole balance is around that idea
 struct: I see, I can understand why you abandoned it
 reCurse: It was motivation before difficulty
 struct: yeah
 struct: Knowing it will just be another multi with &lt; 100 players is harsh
 derjack: yinsh got a little boost being potw
 derjack: during contest
 reCurse: And knowing CG attracts quite a few players from Japan, I'm sure they'd be all over it
 reCurse: It's a popular game over there
 reCurse: That's where the best players in the world are mostly
 derjack: othello is pretty popular in japan no?
 reCurse: True, at some point in history at least, maybe still now, I don't know
 reCurse: Too many projects not enough time as usual
 reCurse: Just talking about it now I want to work on it eh, but it's pointless
 ljwoodward: People who win clashes and don't share their code are the worst people
 reCurse: Ok
 MSmits: I'm a worst people&#160;:(
 MSmits: wait no i'm not
 MSmits: i don't win
 MSmits: wew
 1457162:&#160;:-D

 MSmits: haha
 BlaiseEbuth: "I killed a man. And you?""I play clashs of code."
 Srijandev: lol
 ljwoodward: Exactly, I'm glad you understand

 MSmits: it's easy&#160;:)
 MSmits: as is making a simple ttt implementation. I didn't realize how much of the code of my previous ones was about the interface of making it human-playable
 MSmits: whats left is like 30 lines or so
 struct: grats on rank 2 YurkovAS
 MSmits: which game?
 MSmits: contest game?
 struct: sc21
 MSmits: ohh, gj YurkovAS
 MSmits: it always surprises me that people can continue to play a game after contest. I am always burned out on it by that point
 struct: maybe I jinxed it&#160;:/
 YurkovAS: thanks!
 KalamariKing: MSmits yeah same
 KalamariKing: some people just don't get burned out ig
 MSmits: I guess so, and in that case, the PM thread does provide a load of ideas to try
 reCurse: 10 days isn't that long :P
 MSmits: in general it's not, but you're playing a game you didn't choose yourself. I can work with a game for months if it fascinates me. 
 reCurse: Why not both
 MSmits: I just mean it's unlikely for a contest-game to be interesting to me in the long term. This one was better than most in that regard, but I like simple boardgames better
 struct: I enjoy the game as long as it doesnt have hidden info
 MSmits: i dont like hidden info either, except  with ooc, because it was a major feature there
 struct: or 10 pages of furles
 struct: ooc it makes sense yes
 MSmits: furles?
 struct: rules*
 struct: :D
 MSmits: I was thinking of a book full of furry creaturs
 Wiilss: same
 struct: unleash the geek hidden info also makes sense
 MSmits: kind of, but it's more important in ooc
 reCurse: Oh boy ooc, I can't stop thinking about how to search
 reCurse: Got some ideas but it's gonna take a while to get started
 Illusive: same me 1 week pro
 struct: I think its one of the hardest games to get started
 struct: imo
 reCurse: Well I can reuse bitboard from coif so there's that
 Wiilss: ""
 MSmits: yeah, the wood bosses were ridiculous
 MSmits: at first
 MSmits: then they made them weaker
 MSmits: I use several different bitboard for ooc
 MSmits: int16 for position, int32 for mines and int64 for damage
 reCurse: Search is going to take a lot of iterations to be good though I think
 reCurse: And 50ms
 reCurse: This is tough
 MSmits: yep
 WolfDarrigan: I'm near the top of silver in ooc, but my code is horribly inefficient
 MSmits: can always make it more efficient 
 MSmits: if you want
 WolfDarrigan: My bot is more about memory and time management than about any strategy for the game :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: mine too
 MSmits: i didnt get around to experimenting with heuristics
 MSmits: well, only a little bit
 MSmits: i did only use half the contest time though, had two breaks in that month. Probably could have done better
 MSmits: month is too long to keep my interest
 WolfDarrigan: I started to go down a rabbit hole of detecting choke points that would be good to mine, but got stuck on "should the edge of the board count as terrain" because it was putting mines in what I'd consider dumb places
 WolfDarrigan: never got that working, so it is just commented out
 MSmits: ah, my bots are always full of commented out stuff that didnt work&#160;:)
 VizGhar: jave is extremely verbose language

 ZarthaxX: yep
 ZarthaxX: i hardcoded that 7 in my loops, a bug that lasted one year

 ZarthaxX: and costed me tshirt prob
 struct: unlucky zarthax
 struct: your current WW bot is broken ZarthaxX
 struct: also euler bot
 ZarthaxX: wat
 struct: your bot is broken
 struct: Timeout turn 1
 ZarthaxX: ffs lemme check
 ZarthaxX: ty for that
 struct: np
 ZarthaxX: ok idk why
 MSmits: is it C#?
 MSmits: because C# had an update
 MSmits: breaking some botds
 ZarthaxX: nope
 MSmits: ah i just figured because eulers is also broken
 struct: no error?
 ZarthaxX: not getting compilatiopn errors
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: it doesnt return from a function
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: literally when it has to return it dies
 ZarthaxX: how can this break from nowhere

 Coelurus: Hello my programming n1bbas
 eulerscheZahl: what a great time to open the chat
 struct: hi euler
 struct: your ww bot is broken get your points back
 eulerscheZahl: it was at the bottom of the league before that already
 struct: ah
 eulerscheZahl: in fact it's not broken, just bad&#160;:(
 Illusive: world chat be like
 Wiilss: worlde
 Ablert: E
 Illusive: #include &lt;worldchat&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: btw ZarthaxX i'll take the dice assets if I can get some. If I use a toggle to switch between current and other model, it's fine to have a less detailed replacement
 ZarthaxX: oh okey
 ZarthaxX: i guess we would need to test up to which point is ok
 ZarthaxX: like acceptable loss of details
 eulerscheZahl: maybe: rounded edges (also because of rolling animation which assumes some radius) but flat eyes
 ZarthaxX: oh flat eyes would make it possible i think
 Ablert: E
 ZarthaxX: so round edges is a must
 eulerscheZahl: not a must. but nice to have
 ZarthaxX: i meant that it would look weird in the animation haha
 TheBatMan_TM: hey guys what's the online replacement for Postman?
 eulerscheZahl: and as the game is approved already: the arrangement of the sides should match with the existing model of course :D
 ZarthaxX: right
 eulerscheZahl: email @TheBatMan_TM
 TheBatMan_TM: what?
 TheBatMan_TM: no i mean Postman the API tester
 Illusive: yo my slime
 Wiilss: #include
 eulerscheZahl: why do you need a replacement for it?
 Illusive: yo my drilla
 eulerscheZahl: i think i should kick
 Illusive: what
 Wiilss: i speak british
 TheBatMan_TM: eulerscheZahl coz i can't download it locally, i need online
 Illusive: do you man speak american or british
 Xerock: hl
 TheBatMan_TM: which is the best online API tester?
 TheBatMan_TM: as a replacement to Postman
 reCurse: Nostalgia
 eulerscheZahl: i got your question now. never saw the need to try it with an online tool
 jacek: if you give sides in input, they can be changed, right?
 KalamariKing: what
 KalamariKing: elaborate
 Ablert: #E
 MSmits: mmh  i am seeing the problem with converting xor example to a more general case if you're not using numpy :P
 MSmits: more loops within loops because you dont have just 2 inputs&#160;:)
 Ablert: #h
 Ablert: #e
 Ablert: #l
 Ablert: #l
 Ablert: #o
 KalamariKing: you're gonna get kicked :eyes:
 Ablert: E
 ErrorCookie: #whatsthis
 jacek: MSmits you cant generalize well?
 MSmits: no i mean, if you take your xor example, it splits into two arrays i1 and i2 for the two parts of each input
 MSmits: but were you to do this for TTT, for example, you cant do it this way
 MSmits: because input has way more parts
 jacek: oh right inputs number is hardcoded
 MSmits: so it really turns into matrix-work then
 jacek: well just anoter dim in array
 MSmits: yeah it's fine, i'll generalize to multiple dimensions and try to get it working without numpu
 MSmits: numpy
 MSmits: then i'll transform it to a numpy version
 MSmits: then tensorflow
 KalamariKing: thats like
 KalamariKing: a lot of transformations
 MSmits: it's a learning exercise
 MSmits: i dont know numpy and i dont know tensorflow
 KalamariKing: tensorflow isn't made for numpy btw, internally it copies it all to another tensor
 KalamariKing: so use tf.data
 tiabeanie: hello
 MSmits: allright I'll try to remember. It's fine if i get stuck on this later, thats how you learn
 tiabeanie: how is everyone
 MSmits: I is good
 MSmits: you?
 jacek: if NN is stuck, this is how it doesnt learn tho
 MSmits: i mean me :P
 KalamariKing: I used to work with tf a lot, it takes a good few seconds with a large enough numpy dataset
 MSmits: what does?
 KalamariKing: predicting
 MSmits: because of the internal conversion of the data?
 KalamariKing: yeah
 MSmits: ah ok
 KalamariKing: tf.data is a little harder, since it doesn't have ALL the internal commands, but it too is c++ so is equally fast for converting
 KalamariKing: its just MUCH faster for predicting
 scareware047: won't it cache the dataset
 KalamariKing: Yes and no
 KalamariKing: When predicting, you're feeding it data it (usually) hasn't seen before
 scareware047: alright nvm I work in cv I was mostly my own pipeline ;d
 KalamariKing: lol its fine
 MSmits: yay, converted to N dimensional inputs&#160;:)
 MSmits: works
 KalamariKing: is tensorflow on cg?
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: no
 KalamariKing: oh lol
 KalamariKing: MSmits are you pushing the nn to cg? if so how
 MSmits: no, you train a model, build a c++ inferer and put your weights in a massive string that you decode in the first 1 second
 KalamariKing: yeah that's what I thought
 MSmits: eventually, i will, see above statement
 MSmits: for now, just practicing
 KalamariKing: yeah
 MSmits: trying to do a simple NN that learns to play TTT from playing games with itself
 KalamariKing: ooh sounds like fun
 MSmits: I'm doing ply 1 search and matching ply 1 value as target (negated) to root value
 MSmits: so root is input, ply 1 result is target
 KalamariKing: interesting
 KalamariKing: are you using a large nn?
 MSmits: since endgames are exact, doing enough passes should teach it to play perfectly
 MSmits: i am not using anything yet
 MSmits: i made a TT implementation and generalized xor example to N dimensions
 MSmits: TTT
 KalamariKing: oh I see
 MSmits: now i need to combine them
 MSmits: no idea how many neurons i will need
 MSmits: i use 1 hidden layer for now
 MSmits: hardcoded
 KalamariKing: that's the thing, neuron counts are difficult
 MSmits: it's easy to experiment because training should not take forever
 KalamariKing: one-hot i/o, i presume?
 MSmits: i can do that, but i am doing a -1,0,1 input first
 MSmits: might be bad, i dunno
 KalamariKing: For x, o, _?
 KalamariKing: interesting indeed
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: because it is so simple, i can experiment by comparing one hot with the other thing
 KalamariKing: can your backprop func handle negatives? sigmoid (I think) can only take 0-1
 MSmits: apparently in oware, robo and jace k are using one hot, but Robo also effectively used whole seedcounts as input
 MSmits: KalamariKing you mean negative output right?
 MSmits: I can transform -1 to 1 to a [0,1] interval
 KalamariKing: I believe negative all around
 MSmits: to avoid negative output
 MSmits: so a loss is 0
 KalamariKing: Transforming is easy
 MSmits: draw - 0.5
 jacek: hm?
 jacek: yeah, match your data to your output
 MSmits: how do you mean jacek
 jacek: if sigmoid then 0, 0.5, 1. if tanh then -1, 0, 1
 KalamariKing: yeah that
 MSmits: oh you mean my last activation should be tanh 
 jacek: could be. i mean you need to adjust your target, thats all
 MSmits: do you mean i can either change the interval for my target or change my activation function as long as they match?
 KalamariKing: I presume you're not looking more than the current move into the future?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: I am just trying all possible moves yes
 MSmits: the reason for that is that the game is too easily solvable. If i searched further then it would just be a minimax
 jrke: how many input you are taking MS?
 MSmits: for now just 9 cells
 MSmits: with -1,0,1 
 MSmits: but with onehot that would be 27
 jrke: i thinking to train first simple tictactoe NN
 MSmits: reCurs e says TTT is not the best trainign example
 jrke: with 9 cells 3*3 and same like yours -1 for opp 0 for none and 1 for me
 jacek: he has grudge against uttt
 MSmits: I think I've read enough about the subject that it doesnt really matter if i pick this, not sure where you are at jrke
 jacek: i think
 MSmits: well he does at that, but this is TTT&#160;:)
 MSmits: jrke then we are doing the same thing i guess
 jrke: i am not doing UTTT am trying to do for TTT
 MSmits: yes, same
 jrke: oh
 MSmits: just practice
 MSmits: i already learned python is extremely annoying because of having to put "self" everywhere
 jrke: so do you expect output a value or move
 MSmits: value
 MSmits: but move is fine
 MSmits: depends on what you want to practice
 MSmits: move could be cool actually, more meaningful output is good for practicing
 jrke: so you have 9 neurons + bias
 MSmits: no, 9 inputweights + bias
 MSmits: no idea how many neurons
 MSmits: will maybe try starting at 100 or something
 MSmits: i assume you mean hidden neurons
 jrke: yes
 MSmits: yes, then it can be any number. The more you have, the more information/patterns can be encoded
 MSmits: not sure what happens if you have too many, your NN will become slower to use in any case
 MSmits: it will be interesting to find out what the minimum required number is
 jrke: thats why we need some kinda tuning for that
 jrke: done manually i thin
 MSmits: you need tuning for everything
 jrke: k
 MSmits: and it doesnt have to be manual
 MSmits: people use GA's and other methods for this
 MSmits: you can have a bunch of parameters, set a min/max value and just randomly generate combinations and train your NN's from them
 MSmits: not ideal, but better than grid search according to reCurs e
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: say you think you need between 100 and 1000 neurons, learning rate between 0,01 and 0,2 etc
 jrke: i am not sure what neuron exact;y is
 MSmits: a neuron is an in-between step in calculation, it's not something that is stored in your network
 jrke: what is the difference between input weights and neurons?
 MSmits: the neuron is basically the calculation result from the combination of input, input_weights, bias and activation
 MSmits: the neuron becomes the input for the next layer
 MSmits: so the input itself can be considered a neuron
 MSmits: and the output as well
 jrke: oh and each layer has different input weights
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: if you use 1 hidden layer
 MSmits: there are two series of connections
 MSmits: input to hidden and hidden to output
 MSmits: they both have weights and biases
 MSmits: and activation
 MSmits: btw, this is just a MLP version of NN. There's others too that have tons of different features, but i wouldnt worry about those yet
 MSmits: to be exact, it's a MLP with 1 hidden layer, you cna have more than 1
 MSmits: also something i wouldnt bother with at first
 jacek: for more info about it, lets google MLP in images google
 MSmits: :grin:
 jrke: yeah don't make complex at first stage of practice
 MSmits: jrke i would do the xor example first if you havent
 MSmits: it really helped me
 jrke: yeah i did that
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: yay, i succesfully trained it on 4 TTT states
 KalamariKing: amazing
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3e88733-397a-423a-8aca-94d04f696683">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3e88733-397a-423a-8aca-94d04f696683</a>
 jrke: cool
 MSmits: just to see if the framework does its thing
 KalamariKing: is it doing its thing
 MSmits: yea&#160;:)
 MSmits: now it needs to work for thousands of those :0
 KalamariKing: :o
 KalamariKing: are you training locally or no
 KalamariKing: also language
 KalamariKing: python I presume, since its t
 KalamariKing: tf*
 KalamariKing: MSmits
 MSmits: locally
 MSmits: simple python only
 MSmits: no numpy
 KalamariKing: have you heard of google colab
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's like using jupyter notebooks
 KalamariKing: why not use it
 KalamariKing: yeah
 jrke: but he don't need that heavy trainning yet
 MSmits: because  i am trying to do this really low level
 jrke: so locally is enough
 MSmits: i will just do it once
 KalamariKing: but its fasterrrrrr
 MSmits: dont care&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: y'all are wack
 MSmits: it's just a one time exercise
 MSmits: i will probably port it to trinket.io
 MSmits: which doesnt have tensorflow and whatnot
 KalamariKing: I see
 MSmits: my students know trinket and i can use it as an example and embed it in our learning environment
 MSmits: not for any serious exercise, but they can check if out if they're interested
 MSmits: i also tested xor example in trinket, worked fine
 MSmits: for serious exercises i used the tensorflow playground, it's great
 KalamariKing: forgot you were a teacher lol
 MSmits: hehe yup still am
 KalamariKing: woah how does tf playground work
 KalamariKing: this does not look like code
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playground.tensorflow.org/">https://playground.tensorflow.org/</a>
 KalamariKing: yeah
 MSmits: it's visual, to get an understanding how NN works without math
 KalamariKing: eww
 MSmits: well i cant expect much more from high school students&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: thats so weird
 KalamariKing: my guy
 KalamariKing: how old do you think I am
 annaproxy: ...
 MSmits: no idea, but if you're a high school student you aren't my average high school student :P
 KalamariKing: lol ig
 KalamariKing: neural networks are so much fun tho
 MSmits: mine are 15-19 yrs old and barely know python
 KalamariKing: :o
 MSmits: no oop either
 Purinto: t'es là kami&#160;? 
 KalamariKing: what
 KalamariKing: how
 MSmits: they only get 3 yrs of CS and it has a lot of subjects unrelated to coding
 MSmits: only 2-3 hrs a week
 MSmits: also html/css, databases etc.
 KalamariKing: Purinto who's kami
 KalamariKing: that's so weirdI mean, the CS courses aren't great here either, but damn
 MSmits: it's not the course it's the subject matter
 Manchi_o6o7: Can someone explain me tree traversal differences. When we use postorder, when preorder etc.
 MSmits:  we do try to do more for excelling students
 KalamariKing: wdym
 MSmits: the subject matter is easy, but we offer extra stuff for those who want it
 KalamariKing: as in, like, you do more for the students doing well or you do more to try to make all students excel
 MSmits: i had a few students solve puzzles on CG
 MSmits: yes
 KalamariKing: oh thats sick
 MSmits: one guy was in the contest actually
 MSmits: he quickly left after he got into silver i think
 KalamariKing: wait really?
 KalamariKing: oh lol
 MSmits: had to do exams
 MSmits: it's his last year
 KalamariKing: yeah
 MSmits: he is usually top 10-20% in contests
 KalamariKing: wait fr?
 MSmits: also solved some hard puzzles here
 KalamariKing: well gg to him
 MSmits: yeah
 KalamariKing: wow ok looks like I got some improving to do
 MSmits: but students like him are rare
 Manchi_o6o7: MSmits can you maybe help me out
 MSmits: depends on your problem Manchi_o6o7
 KalamariKing: Manchi_o6o7 just ask, I'm sure someone here can
 jacek: Manchi_o6o7 check applications <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Applications">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Applications</a>
 KalamariKing: tree traversal differences, right
 Manchi_o6o7: yes
 KalamariKing: preorder/postorder
 AntiSquid: are you talking about your students MSmits&#160;?
 Manchi_o6o7: and inorder
 MSmits: yeah
 KalamariKing: I don't even know what those two things mean so I can't help
 MSmits: well just teaching CS in general
 AntiSquid: do you remember Petras&#160;? 
 MSmits: I remember the name and seeing him here, but i dont know much about him
 AntiSquid: was a highschooler
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: jrke is too
 AntiSquid: quite high ranking
 MSmits: jrke is pretty amazing
 AntiSquid: isn't jrke 12&#160;?
 MSmits: not sure, but very young
 AntiSquid: ah 13
 AntiSquid: he said it
 jrke: yeah was 12 now 13
 MSmits: thats how that work&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: don't lie, i am sure it's the other way around jrke
 KalamariKing: wait
 KalamariKing: jrke
 jrke: was 13 now 12&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: you were 12 not too long ago, and you're placing as high as you are
 KalamariKing: wow gg
 MSmits: yeah he spent a lot of time on dots and boxes too
 MSmits: you should check out that leaderboard
 jacek: hes doing algo instead of drugs&#160;:(
 jrke: dots and boxes was my most interesting to project to work on
 KalamariKing: dots and boxes?
 MSmits: a multi
 KalamariKing: like the pen/paper game?

 StormyPluto3865: benford's law was a bit of a challenge.
 StormyPluto3865: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: ah no worries
 AntiSquid: a lot of people out there who should be experts don't understand that law either, so you're fine
 StormyPluto3865: :slight_smile:
 jacek: just like monty hall paradox
 jacek: i read even that famous mathematician couldnt believe it
 StormyPluto3865: Now benford's law makes a bit more sense.
 AntiSquid: well first results on google for me&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/fun/monty-hall-problem/">https://statisticsbyjim.com/fun/monty-hall-problem/</a>a statistician who doesn't believe it, so ... got to look at it more
 gnogge: were can i learn more about coding?
 StormyPluto3865: maybe w3schools if you're using javascript?
 Smelty: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 gnogge: okay thanks, because im trying to learn here but i dont understand a thing
 StormyPluto3865: yeah
 StormyPluto3865: I've been coding for like 3 years but I never did anything useful.
 StormyPluto3865: Now I kind of do something
 jacek: well codingame isnt for complete newbies, its to improve the skills
 gnogge: oh okay
 MSmits: mmh I managed to get my network to play games untrained, but I was getting sometimes 50% vs random, sometimes 70% etc. Turns out the problem is of course that the network is completely deterministic once you initialized its weights
 MSmits: it's not a random bot :P
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: it's pretty fast though 2000 games in a second is ok
 MSmits: considering it's basic python
 MSmits: now i need to start gathering information from the games for the learning, aka,, the hard part
 jacek: given how much effort you dedicate for booking, its terrifying to see when you master NN and start training
 MSmits: thanks for the compliment&#160;:)
 MSmits: takes some talent too, I think doesn't it? Effort won't be the problem
 MSmits: we'll see how well this goes
 MSmits: I like it more than I thought i would
 MSmits: the fact that you guys talk about it so much helps a ton btw. I wouldn't even know where to start if it wasn't for you jacek
 AntiSquid: what are you doing atm MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: atm trying to get my TTT network to learn
 MSmits: i have a ttt implementation that works and my network can play games and learn from states. Now it needs to get the right combination of input and target values
 MSmits: just a few more lines of code, then probably fixing a lot of bugs and then of course figuring out all the hyperparameters. No idea how hard that will be
 AntiSquid: i would just follow a github example if i were you
 MSmits: doing fine on my own so far. But I spend so many months reading and hearing about it, that I can start from a fully formed plan. That helps a lot
 AntiSquid: problem is when you try to adapt it to something new (harder)
 MSmits: well what i did was adapt the xor example various ways. I changed activation, made it able to take 9 inputs and i made 4 toy states with targets for a TTT board, it was able to learn those 
 MSmits: I'll share it if i get it working
 jacek: plot twist: he'll never get it working
 MSmits: that's totally possible&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ah, well for TTT you'll get countless working examples
 MSmits: yeah, I think I'll experiment a bit with different choices and see what kind of network is easiest to train
 MSmits: what i mean by sharing btw, is that i'll just paste my code here if someone asks. I wasnt intending to write an article. As you say, plenty of those
 AntiSquid: depends on the problem really what is easiest to train (if you mean easiest to train a strong NN that solves x problem)
 AntiSquid: unless you want to stick to a standard approach: input layer, 1 hidden layer, 1 output layer
 AntiSquid: number hidden = count(input + output ) / 2 :D
 AntiSquid: # hidden nodes i mean
 Smelty: oooh
 MSmits: I need far more hidden for my setup
 MSmits: I don't use a one-hot input
 MSmits: so only 9 inputs
 MSmits: and only 1 output
 MSmits: so with your formula thats 5 hidden
 MSmits: probably gonna need more like 100&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe 40 or so, no idea, will try
 Manchi_o6o7: guys, how would the recursive call be written correctly 
 Manchi_o6o7: void deleteTree(NODE **root) {
 Manchi_o6o7: left is type of *NODE
 Manchi_o6o7: in main i call it as deleteTree(&amp;root)
 AntiSquid: no pm thx
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: bubble eye the guy above me
 BitWolf.Sr: hey guys
 BitWolf.Sr: s3x?
 MSmits: yeah that could be true
 Manchi_o6o7: someone who could help out?
 MSmits: thats why one of the experiments i want to do *if* i get it to work, is to find the minimum required for my setup
 AntiSquid: reminds me of the lottery paradox :D
 dreadylein: define overdoing&#160;;) 
 Smelty: o v e r
 Smelty: doing
 AntiSquid: it's something your have to asses yourself
 AntiSquid: you'd *
 MSmits: I think in the context of, say oware, you will probably get less quality of evaluation, but if you keep adding nodes, your performance drops. At some point the gain from having more nodes does not compete with the loss of performance
 MSmits: i think this is how you define it
 dreadylein: the main problem is, finding the best hyperparms is by far the most costy part 
 MSmits: yeah
 dreadylein: more weights normaly mean a higher ceiling, which makes it easier
 dreadylein: as even "suboptimal" networks will yield good perfomance
 MSmits: in the end you dont want your hyperparameters fitted for the fastest training though
 MSmits: you want it fitted for the best performance
 MSmits: ingame
 MSmits: anyways, lots of things to think about
 dreadylein: hehe
 MSmits: pretty sure the other guys have done this
 dreadylein: its part of the fun, isnt it
 MSmits: yeah
 UUolfo: are there any machine learning puzzles/programs besides the basic decision tree 1&amp;2? can't find much
 jacek: maybe binary neural network
 KiwiTae: in somegames and cpp , you can get a timeout error if you have a nullptr somewhere?
 AntiSquid: i'd argue the MCTS puzzles are a step in that direction too UUolfo
 UUolfo: thank you
 MSmits: if you want to use machine learning for games here, learna  good search algorithm first
 MSmits: doesn't even have to be mcts i guess. You could just use minimax
 Manchi_o6o7: can someone help me out. I have a NODE pointing to a struct as the data. When I free the node, it just removes one part of the struct
 Manchi_o6o7: not the whole struct
 reCurse: *cough* You don't even need a search algorithm
 jacek:  
 MSmits: true you dont need one. You can just see if your network performs better than smart heuristics
 MSmits: but if you want to compete with the top you probably do need a search
 reCurse: Sure except maybe csb
 MSmits: csb networks are so powerful you dont need search?
 reCurse: fenrir has no search
 MSmits: I guess the game is quite hard to eval so that kinda makes sense
 reCurse: "Let's do a full format on this 12tb drive to make sure it has no bad sectors." 5 hours later, 29% done. Crap.
 MSmits: oops
 struct: 12 tb o.o
 reCurse: I think I just realized how much space that is
 AntiSquid: isn't the entire point of ML to ignore search and make your model learn on its own? @_@
 AntiSquid: (rhetorical q )
 struct: yes im doing it so i dont ahve to code at all
 struct:  /s
 AntiSquid: now you're exaggerating
 MSmits: AntiSquid the model learns what a good state is, but it's still better if it knows what a good state is 5 turns from now
 AntiSquid: a lot of coding is done outside just coding the search
 AntiSquid: i should look up how to apply future knowledge to an LSTM, honestly don't know
 struct: botg NN when?
 kovi: a much deeper network can include a partial search tree
 kovi: to see into the future
 AntiSquid: when i get time struct

 Wontonimo: I have some ideas about NN for BotG.  It hinges on having the ref, because my level of interest does not include rewriting the ref.
 Astrobytes: Ugh. Cat vomited. Laters.
 Wontonimo: pro-tip&#160;: don't try to cover up cat vomit with human vomit.
 Astrobytes: If-else ftw, wouldn't waste time on NNing that
 Wontonimo: you may be right
 Astrobytes: Anyway, take care man, cya tomorrow
 Wontonimo: cya man
 Me42: hi, new to this. What are the debugging options (C#)? Can I Debug.WriteLine or what?
 Wontonimo: yeah, print to stderr
 Wontonimo: instructions are in the starter code
 Wontonimo: if you deleted the starter code, you can get it back by clicking the circle-arrow thing in the upper right corner
 Me42: why indeed it is. thanks
 Wontonimo: but that will delete your current code
 Wontonimo: but you can ctr-z to get it back
 Me42: thanks Wontonimo.
 Wontonimo: lol, no prob
 Wontonimo: what challenge / bot / optimization are you working on?
 Me42: Labyrinth. Was thinking about a just-a-little-less-stupid version of brute force recursive exploration algo (with pruning for less-than-optimal-path), including some logic for the uncertain area's (optimistic routing), but I think the max 150 ms delay will pretty much kill that off :lol:
 Me42: and some nifty backtracking involved of course
 AntiSquid: you can go legend Wontonimo for BotG, you got legend for SC21, BotG is easier to get legend 
 Smelty: o.O
 AntiSquid: Me42 BFS, store the path, you can do it .
 Me42: yeah, path will be in the recursion (backtrack). But I'm falling asleep here.. :lol:
 Me42: thanks AntiSquid.
 Me42: I can figure this out&#160;;)
 Me42: but your support is much appreciated :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: oh thanks AntiSquid, I'll give it a go
 Wontonimo: Go Me42 Go!  That's a good challenge
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Me42: bye!
 Wontonimo: ng good people of cg
 Smelty: bye
 Chainman: hey
 SoggyBunzz:  world chat has been silent for 3 hours... not something you see every day lol
 ZarthaxX: yeah it happens prety often
 ZarthaxX: except on contests
 Chainman: pewpew break the silence
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Smelty: :rofl:
 Chainman: This one does not spark joy

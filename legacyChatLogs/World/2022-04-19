 weebiss: this is hard
 MSmits: it is hard until it is easy
 weebiss: still tho
 MSmits: sure yeah, but if it was easy, it would not be interesting
 jacek: ohai
 jacek: gonna be on contest?
 jacek: apparently crossover may work in my neuro'evolutiion'. but parents must come from the same single ancestor and theres need not much difference in generations. i'll call this incest is wincest
 VizGhar: what are you working on jacek?
 MSmits: I'm gonna be in the contest yeah. Trying to finish some work so i have the time
 IvesL: i have got a question
 IvesL: how do you really build a simulation in bot programming
 jacek: VizGhar randomly adjusting NN weights in hopes to make it useful
 jacek: IvesL depends on the game. sometimes you can look at the referee to see how did they implement it
 IvesL: look at the referee?
 jacek: its about having some state, making move and updating this state. in chess or checkers it would mean something different than in mad pod racing
 IvesL: thats exactly my thought
 jacek: on codingame SDK the game is ran by referee which takes users' outputs and gives them inputs
 IvesL: state is different from game to game, so is there some thoughts or approaches on building steps towards it
 jacek: depends what objects a game has. you would have list of pieces in chess and current player. in MPR list of pods, their positions and velocity
 IvesL: so lets use mad pod racing as an example, an even easier version, only 1pod vs 1pod
 VizGhar: I was looking at MPR wandering what it could possibly be for too long... now I realized
 IvesL: lets say im going to simulate next 5 moves, if my pod touches the checkpoint, i reward it
 VizGhar: uf... this is harder one to simulate&#160;:)Your pod has position and velocity. you need to update both based on action you make... there is complete post mortem by magus with exact computations there 
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 VizGhar: this one is particullary hard because of ellastic colisions
 jacek: simulation and 'rewarding' or 'evaluation' are 2 different things
 IvesL: right, the hard part is physics
 IvesL: so let's also ignore that part
 IvesL: im stuck at just the game state
 IvesL: cant implement it
 jacek: so, essentialy search race
 IvesL: jacek that is basically me in every game right now
 IvesL: i know how should i optimize it, but i dont how should i build an environment/game state to work around with it
 jacek: lol, i meant <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race</a>
 jacek: which is essentially 1 player mad pod racing
 IvesL: so is it true that in order to make a simulation, you basically rebuild every tiny aspects mentioned in your code?
 Uljahn: you have to reimplement the game rules (recreate the game engine)
 Uljahn: and state is a group of variables, which summarizes the history of the system in order to predict the future values
 IvesL: so i am going to watch some vids on chess ai to see how things work, the procedures and how should one think when building
 IvesL: i hope its going to help
 jacek: your question is programming nature. most chess ai videos will probably talk about it at high level like tree search with little to no implementation
 IvesL: do you have better starts at learning the programming nature? 
 IvesL: im thankful for all you guys' suggestions, at least i have now got some directions to move on
 jacek: try tic tac toe. how would you simulate next moves?
 IvesL: thanks i would also focus on that
 jacek: :upside_down:
 aRazmus: hey everyone! is there any way to output variables to the console without breaking the execution?
 5DN1L: check the default code, it shows you how
 5DN1L: it's printing to the error stream
 aRazmus: Ahh gotcha! Cheers!
 weebiss: hii
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you even random?
 Automaton2000: i would like to see how it goes
 Endya: hey, do you know if linking github account to a puzzle or a challenge is possible to work with my own IDE or to work with friend&#160;?
 Leeward: @Endya When you're working on a puzzle, click Settings in the left sidebar, at the bottom there is an option "Use an external code editor". I'm pretty sure you could set up VSCode or whatever with remote co-op for exactly that.
 Endya: Thx for the answer i'll try that
 Frankich: Leeward, keep in mind that the option "Use an external code editor" is only available when you installed CG local
 Leeward: I assumed that much was obvious?
 jacek: i never heard of external code editor oO
 Leeward: Well here's the link in case you can't see it in the sidebar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>
 Frankich: this user looks new, if you don't check the forum about that, or ask in the chat, it is not that obvious to me
 Leeward: I don't have anything CG related locally installed and I can see that option in the sidebar when I'm in a puzzle
 Leeward: But fair enough, rather give too much info than too little
 Frankich: don't you have at least the extension&#160;?
 Leeward: Nope
 Westicles: is there a way to disable the box that pops up in the IDE when you hover over variables?
 Frankich: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359</a>
 5DN1L: Westicles I think it's   "editor.hover.enabled": false
 Westicles: 5DN1L thanks!  that's been bugging me for a while
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Frankich: Oh the option is by default on Chrome.. I did not know that, sorry Leeward
 Leeward: No problem, always happy to learn
 5DN1L: I don't find "Use an external code editor" in my settings. I'm using Firefox
 5DN1L: I don't need it, so it's not an issue
 Frankich: It is not on Firefox by default. That's why you need to use "CG Local" on FF if you want to use an external editor. CG Sync is only working on Chrome as far as I remember.
 5DN1L: i see. it's nice to know that
 5DN1L: ah, why didn't i notice "editor.mouseWheelZoom" in editor configuration before? i should have set it to False long time ago. all the accidental zooming i don't need was so annoying to me
 jacek: oh my

 ycsvenom: what's the difference between a moderator and a '[CG]' prefixed moderator?
 derjack: [CG] is paid
 ycsvenom: noice
 Uljahn: [CG] are actual admins and platform developers while mods are regular users
 ZndrBrok: Is there a chance that codingame would implement .NET 6 for C# users&#160;? :innocent: 
 ZndrBrok: It would give us a chance in shortCodeClashes against all those snakes :P
 ZndrBrok: And without needing to compact all on one line :P
 jacek: hopefully they dont do anything big before/during contest
 ycsvenom: good point

 Joe0: hello world
 Joe0: what do people talk about here?
 5DN1L: coding
 Joe0: can this site add some room for esolangs?
 5DN1L: You can make a suggestion in the forum
 Joe0: ok
 5DN1L: let the CG staff know and decide

 Thorcode: hope the spring not really hard
 5DN1L: Ah it'll be your first contest
 Thorcode: how do you know that
 5DN1L: I read your profile
 Thorcode: i'm also loooking at yours 
 5DN1L: :joy:
 Joe0: @5DN1L Ok I just threw out a suggestion on the forum under the site advancement category
 Thorcode: but don't know how many contest you registered
 Joe0: *I meant platform evolution
 5DN1L: Yeah, I've just moved merge the post under Languages update, Joe0
 5DN1L: moved and merged
 Joe0: Thx
 5DN1L: yw
 Joe0: What do you think about the idea?
 5DN1L: I don't have any opinions on the idea really
 Joe0: ok
 5DN1L: Thorcode you can click RANKING to see more details
 Joe0: Does this site hire?
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: bruh me
 Thorcode: your first too if you participate
 5DN1L: yup
 5DN1L: Joe0 I'm sure they do, from time to time
 Joe0: @5DN1L Does this site have a way of pulling in any revenue?
 Thorcode: dunno
 5DN1L: Yeah, they do it through some other services
 Joe0: I'm curious since I haven
 Joe0: t seen any ads

 Astrobytes: Joe0: there are a few brainfck and at least one befunge puzzles
 Astrobytes: in fact, one BF optim and one befunge-like optim
 Astrobytes: and good afternoon btw&#160;:)
 Joe0: Astrobytes: how would one (such as myself) add more languages in the puzzles area?
 5DN1L: good afternoon Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Joe0: what time is it in the uk?
 jacek: but CG already has esolangs - it has javascript
 5DN1L: 2:03 PM
 Joe0: jacek: yea ur right&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Joe0: you can't as such, but you can make puzzles around making an interpreter or such like, get creative&#160;;)
 Thorcode: what if brainfuck in codingame
 5DN1L: solve all puzzles in CG using brainfck?
 Astrobytes: I think the chances of CG adding esolangs will be very small indeed, in fact, I'd say highly unlikely
 Joe0: yea it doesnt exactly meet the goal of CG to help employers find talent
 Astrobytes: Exactly. Not really the right place for it. But - as I said, feel free to implement parts or all of any esolang you like in puzzle or game format
 Astrobytes: Plenty scope there
 Joe0: yea definitely, I didn't really know how that worked yet since I'm a new member
 Astrobytes: Read up on puzzle creation (and the SDK if you're inclined)
 codepraycode: how can we practise please
 5DN1L: what's your goal?
 codepraycode: goal?
 5DN1L: i mean which area do you want to practise?
 jacek: like in soccer?

 Astrobytes: np
 Darleanow: guys,for i in range(12,2) -&gt; is it possible to do the same as two for str&#160;?
 Darleanow: like when seeing strings&#160;?
 5DN1L: what's range(12, 2)?
 Thorcode: nah
 Darleanow: okay ty thorcode
 Thorcode: and also range(12,2) is not eligible in py
 Darleanow: IT IS 
 jacek: its empty
 jacek: its (from,to)
 5DN1L: yes, valid empty range&#160;:)
 Darleanow: AH MB, its the thirsty
 jacek: or you meant range(0,12,2)
 Darleanow: third
 Darleanow: yeah jacek mb mb
 Darleanow: can i do that for strings&#160;?
 Thorcode: nah
 jacek: "xyztzcxcxczx"[0:2:12]
 Thorcode: but you could do the slicig
 Darleanow:&#160;:'( okay
 Thorcode: like use len
 Thorcode: the ez way xd
 cagriy: hello from TURKEY&#160;:))))
 jacek: :o
 5DN1L: "xyztzcxcxczx"[0::2]
 jacek:&#160;::2 for shortest eh
 Darleanow: no 5DN1IL, its removes one every two
 Darleanow: i wanna make a space between every two
 Darleanow: like so i can compare em
 Thorcode: " ".join()?
 isimkullanmiyorum: hi world
 5DN1L: i don't think you can split a string by two
 Uljahn: for a, b in zip("abcdefgh"[:-1], "abcdefgh"[1:]):
 Thorcode: print(" ".join("xyztzcxcxczx"[0::2]))
 5DN1L: you can split a string by one
 Thorcode: i think this for your?
 Darleanow: Throc i have a space now, but not every two char&#160;;)
 Thorcode: ah
 5DN1L: Darleanow try Uljahn's suggestion
 Thorcode: adding space each 2 char in a string bruh
 Darleanow: like it pops one
 Darleanow: okay 5DN1L
 Darleanow: MY HERO
 codepraycode: what are you practising guys
 Darleanow: Uljahn u a god  &lt;3
 5DN1L: zip will be awkward to use if the split length is longer
 5DN1L: i'll just use ["xyztzcxcxczx"[i:i + 2] for i in range(0, 12, 2)]
 5DN1L: then i can join them with spaces
 5DN1L: join the split substrings
 Darleanow: wut is zip
 5DN1L: zip is to join each item of two or more lists one by one
 Darleanow: oh okay i see, but it worked when ive did it using the same string
 jacek: wut is rar
 5DN1L: e.g. list(zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))
 5DN1L: result is [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
 5DN1L: rar is something that can be unrar-ed
 jacek: do you pay for it
 jacek: like for the papers?
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: is Smits still around? Didn't see him for a while

 cang.java: hi bro
 eulerscheZahl: cang.java that's far from valid java and we don't even know  your intention behind this code

 VizGhar: Maybe he want to parse string... to string_
 eulerscheZahl: hi, haven't seen you in a while
 cang.java: he told me to enter uotput and input one, two, three.
 Jerrasterix: yup, was busy with my academics, graduating from high school next year... to much pressure from teachers to study :sob:
 Jerrasterix: just came back for the CG contest, good its back to multis
 eulerscheZahl: "high school" as in "Gymnasium"?
 Jerrasterix: bro, I am Indian .... sry for the wrong country in my profile :P
 jacek: is this a school where you get high?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that really confused me
 Astrobytes: jacek: naturally
 eulerscheZahl: always thought you were German
 jacek: :scream:
 Jerrasterix: nice one jacek :lol:
 Jerrasterix: ohh... sorry dude&#160;!!
 eulerscheZahl: i was expecting him to make fun of the "Gymnasium" vs gym
 eulerscheZahl: even was about to recommend you some coding contest that i just shared on #de
 eulerscheZahl: but i think it's for Germans only
 VizGhar: uff... friendship broken
 Jerrasterix: ohhh.... thanks euler!!
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: What if we just pretend to be Germans?
 Joe0: we need to speak germa
 eulerscheZahl: they will notice when they try to ship the prizes

 Jerrasterix: do you have these imgs ready, jacek&#160;?? 
 Astrobytes: love that movie
 eulerscheZahl: they will notice when I claim more than 1 prize myself
 Astrobytes: meh
 eulerscheZahl: haven't seen the movie yet
 Jerrasterix: what movie is it&#160;??
 Astrobytes: It's really good
 eulerscheZahl: ingloriuous bastards
 Astrobytes: Inglourious Basterds
 eulerscheZahl: didn't fix typo to be faster than astro
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: like monte carlo - fast but not always correct
 eulerscheZahl: take that. i'm ready for contest!
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Jerrasterix: more than 1 day to go.... 
 eulerscheZahl: i might just give up on topcoder. no ideas left&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: submission deadline in 1 day 6h
 eulerscheZahl: and radewoosh first by a lot
 Astrobytes: yeah, rest your brain before CG contest
 eulerscheZahl: but once i started, it's hard to stop
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i never play those 3 month contests
 Astrobytes: true
 Jerrasterix: any leads on what the contest is based on.... 
 eulerscheZahl: this time i have no idea
 eulerscheZahl: nailed the last two
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 AmirH_O: do you guys have codeforces handles?

 Jerrasterix: It may be jacek..
 Astrobytes: possible
 eulerscheZahl: complexity 4.06 / 5. i think we can exclude that
 Astrobytes: lol, might be simplified
 eulerscheZahl: coop game? please no
 jacek: O(0.812)? not so complex
 Astrobytes: eww yeah, no coop
 Jerrasterix: you have to path find and dodge your opp while your opp tries to reach and kill you, That's not too hard meh..
 eulerscheZahl: that's a summary of CotC
 eulerscheZahl: galleon wars
 eulerscheZahl: thanks squid for the name...

 jacek: oO
 Jerrasterix: :O
 eulerscheZahl: like java should do, if garbage collection would work better
 Astrobytes: haha
 Jerrasterix: euler becoming more hatred towards java :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: it's not even free anymore
 Astrobytes: Oracle have finally lost their minds?
 eulerscheZahl: did i misunderstand something?
 eulerscheZahl: let me check again before making false claims
 Astrobytes: Oracle own Java afaik
 eulerscheZahl: yes, they do
 eulerscheZahl: Oracle JDK 11, Oracle JDK Java 8, and Oracle JRE with Java Web Start in Java 8, are available to Oracle Customers via My Oracle Support and also under the OTN License Agreement for Java SE.

 jacek: free jaffa!
 eulerscheZahl: no, kill jaffar and save the princess
 Astrobytes: java's so bloated they should have called it Jabba
 SyntaxMudra: what is the first thing in learning to learn java
 Jerrasterix: anyways, Idc.. I mostly use dotnet these days 
 Astrobytes: learning to type really long statements
 Jerrasterix: learning it is language full of bloats
 eulerscheZahl: same. both for private coding and professionally .net is my default.some C++ at work
 eulerscheZahl: afk to cycle through the forests. see you

 BrunoFelthes: what is the reference from the contest image?
 5DN1L: Who knows how long this chat will still remain here
 Astrobytes: not sure, we were trying to guess earlier but didn't come up with much
 Leeward: I thought it was original art?
 Astrobytes: It is, but there is always a theme
 BrunoFelthes: it is always an original art... 
 BrunoFelthes: but maybe is it a fight game?

 5DN1L: Did you read the external resoruces on the front page of the puzzle?
 bugMaker-237: Yep
 5DN1L: and?
 bugMaker-237: I think i understand the algo of dicothomic search
 bugMaker-237: I've already used that
 Shazbaz: If you're on the CodinGame Discord server, maybe we could hop in a voice channel and work on it together?
 bugMaker-237: But that's not my issue
 bugMaker-237: Shabaz, ok, let me join the discord
 jacek: binary search plx?
 Uljahn: the direction is the hint, it guides your search
 Uljahn: each turn you're given new direction based on your previous move
 bugMaker-237: Yeah, i got that
 Shazbaz: I'll be sitting in the 'General' voice channel under the name Shazbaz when you get there.
 bugMaker-237: my issue is principaly to move along the x or y axis towards the bomb point
 bugMaker-237: Got it, Shazbaz
 RandomSteve: I am having issues with the batman puzzle as well
 Shazbaz: wanna join the discord voice channel?
 jacek: whats with batman puzzle lately?
 Shazbaz: bugMaker-237 have you formatted the output line at the end properly?
 Shazbaz: it standardly comes with ```cout &lt;&lt; "0 0" &lt;&lt; endl;```
 Shazbaz: you'll need to make sure to put your own variables in there
 Shazbaz: something like ```to_string(horizontal_num) + " " + to_string(vertical_num)```

 Wontonimo: I'll turn it on :D
 eulerscheZahl: the taco channel is a good idea to reduce the flood here
 Wontonimo: :taco: struct
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded struct 5 tacos. struct now has 9 taco. Wontonimo now has 41 taco
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: all other taco commands have moved to #taco
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: am i going to do it
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. jacek now has 32 taco
 Automaton2000: but i've never seen it before
 struct: euler have you done any contest recently?
 NewCoder09: :taco: struct
 antiwonto: [auto] NewCoder09 has awarded struct 5 tacos. struct now has 14 taco. NewCoder09 now has 6 taco
 eulerscheZahl: doing topcoder right now. but stuck
 struct: is this the factory one?
 eulerscheZahl: factory?
 struct: ah no that was atcoder
 eulerscheZahl: it's an optim version of "there is no spoon"
 eulerscheZahl: the bridge puzzle
 a-Rye: Thanks Wontonimo! I'll try to keep the taco chat to taco chat
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, i've probably reached the optimum for this season. so i can live with being bad at that particular game
 struct: Well you finished in time for CG
 struct: Maybe the contest will be good
 eulerscheZahl: i hope so
 eulerscheZahl: also 2 other, shorter contests that i plan to do during CG. bad timing
 eulerscheZahl: codejam 1B and morpheus
 struct: Im sure it wont hurt
 eulerscheZahl: you know me. i'm stuck before time runs out anyways
 struct: I think most of us are
 eulerscheZahl: that's the difference between us plebs and the real pros
 jacek: the $$$?
 jacek: the gap between 1st and 2nd in onitama is closing :scream:
 Wontonimo: it's funny when the #taco channel gets more coding related talk than world
 jacek: shakedown Auitomaton2000
 jacek: shakedown Automaton2000
 jacek: :s
 Automaton2000: not sure if i should try that
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 a-Rye: Ajaiy, there's still a lot I need to do. But the problem I'm having is either with my techio.yml or my filestructure within GitHub. 
 jacek: tech.io tutorial?
 a-Rye: yup jacek, I'm trying to replicate my Beginner Python Concepts to Java and C++. Python is easy and requires very little setup. I have wlesavo's C++ structure to work off of. I just need to do it lol
 jacek: you dont need heavy stuff to write code snippset no?
 a-Rye: with Python, no. But so far it seems like I need a separate .sh file for every .cpp file. And I need to tie all those .sh files together in a local makefile. 
 a-Rye: So, every snippet turns into its own code file
 jacek: oh my
 pandaburger: can someone explain to me "for i in input().split()"  like i was 5?
 eulerscheZahl: do you know what input().split() does?
 pandaburger: I know what both do, not what they do together
 eulerscheZahl: input() reads a line from stdin
 pandaburger: I assume but when looped, my brain shuts down
 Tryst: one more puzzle until level 20 :D
 eulerscheZahl: split() just splits it at spaces
 pandaburger: ah, spaces
 eulerscheZahl: so you have "a b c" as input for example
 eulerscheZahl: then input().split() is ['a', 'b', 'c']
 eulerscheZahl: for i in ['a', 'b', 'c'] is a loop over those
 pandaburger: alright
 pandaburger: in a for loop, for i in input().split(), what is i?
 Uljahn: :rolling_eyes:
 pandaburger: is it a, b and then c in respective loops?
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 eulerscheZahl: i is each value of the list
 eulerscheZahl: one after another
 pandaburger: Okay
 [da-kid_2.0: hi
 [da-kid_2.0: hi
 [da-kid_2.0: hi
 [da-kid_2.0: hi
 [da-kid_2.0: hi
 eulerscheZahl: bye
 Uljahn: kicked out
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i miss my mod powers
 jacek: AutomatonNN does he?
 jacek:&#160;:(
 pandaburger: thanks for the help, eulerscheZahl!

 [da-kid_2.0: jacek is write    
 eulerscheZahl: stop writing jacek, join voice chat
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 would you join voice chat too?
 Automaton2000: so what should i start with a very good site to learn
 [da-kid_2.0: ur mum
 [da-kid_2.0: oh god sorry
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 5DN1L: i'm sorry too
 5DN1L: you're banned [da-kid_2.0
 jacek: chat is still not gone :thinking:
 Tryst: shakedown taco
 Tryst: huntdown taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 Tryst: oof
 eulerscheZahl: and languages are still not updated, are they?
 eulerscheZahl: any bets on which languages will break right before the contest? i say it's java
 jacek: D#
 eulerscheZahl: 5DN1L banned the guy and now i'm the one getting weird messages in private. why?!
 5DN1L: i do too
 5DN1L: i just ignore him
 eulerscheZahl: ah, great. was about to do that
 eulerscheZahl: even is some of the trolls are actually funny
 5DN1L: they should learn from jacek
 Tryst: My biggest acomplishment is getting level 20 on codingame, is that sad?
 5DN1L: why sad?
 Tryst: Because it's not the best accomplishment
 5DN1L: you can get even bigger accomplishments in the future i guess
 Tryst: true
 5DN1L: treat this as a milestone
 Tryst: ahh okay
 Tryst: that makes sense
 5DN1L: and congrats&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i've spent a lot of time on project euler when i got into puzzle solving and then slowly shifted to more competitive things
 Tryst: thanks&#160;:)
 Uljahn: what is the best accomplishment btw?
 Tryst: In CodinGame or in life?
 eulerscheZahl: uno reverse card: what's your greatest achievement in terms of CG or similar websites, Uljahn?&#160;;)
 Tryst: In CodinGame I would say the "Damn I'm Good" or any 100% on very hard puzzles
 Uljahn: eulerscheZahl: my greatest CG is some of my solutions being upvoted regularly
 Tryst: Uljahn that's a major win
 TobiasA: mine was getting out of the green levels. I was stuck there for 3 years because I didn't realize codingame was not for noobs:slight_smile:
 Tryst: lol
 Tryst: I was there too
 Tryst: I needed to take a 2 year break from this game in order to get better at coding
 Tryst: Now I would say I'm a lot better though
 Passifi: oh wow I now checked out eulers Project so many new puzzles wow, thanks eulerscherZahl 
 eulerscheZahl: later ones are pretty math heavy. but good quality of puzzles
 TobiasA: yea back then on this site was probably the most confusing time of my life
 eulerscheZahl: my 2nd site where i've spent a lot of hours was hacker.orgit's more about coding and less about math. sadly it's not actively maintained anymore and some puzzles require flash or java applets
 TobiasA: wait where are the euler puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projecteuler.net/">https://projecteuler.net/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: they regularly add a new puzzle every 1 or 2 weeks
 Joe0: Question: Is linux or windows or mac os better for actually writing software commercially?
 Joe0: In ur opinion\
 Tryst: Don't take my opinion to heart but I just like windows personally
 Tryst: Mac OS and Linux are always very buggy for me whenever I use some of my friend's laptops
 a-Rye: Joe0 it depends on the company you work for. My first professional tech job had me working on AWS, in a Windows VM, with a Mac laptop. Writing code in VB, which I never heard of. Just be flexible amongst development environments
 Joe0: ok
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the kind of software. if you want to write the standard in-house software for your company that runs on clients, you probably want to develop on windows as that's what your users are using
 eulerscheZahl: coding in VB? my condolences
 Tryst: ^
 Passifi: When I was looking through the catalog for coding stuff of a german school they offered a full course to become a VB developer (that was last year) so thats either a scam or VB is in demand somehow&#160;? I tend to go scam, but who knows&#160;:)
 Passifi: I mean with python being as powerful as it is is there even a good reason to use VB anymore&#160;?
 a-Rye: As long as you're able to switch between languages, it doesn't matter much. There are a lot of legacy demands for knowing other languages
 eulerscheZahl: like the banks still operating with Cobol
 jacek: the futuristic language
 jacek: you should try jaceklang
 Nerchio: can i write my next bot in cobol
 jacek: || and &amp;&amp; are replaced by corresponding NNs
 eulerscheZahl: only if you spam the forum for a year straight and request that it's added
 eulerscheZahl: or if you compile offline and submit a binary
 Nerchio: we have brainf*ck why not cobol 
 eulerscheZahl: we have?
 eulerscheZahl: that was an April fools prank
 Nerchio: oh damn
 jacek: we have javascript, why not other esolangs
 Nerchio: i missed that it was a prank
 Nerchio: thats disappointing
 Nerchio: well all I want is java 11 :joy: we still have java 8
 Nerchio: talking about stone age languages
 jacek: and android natively is java 7 mostly:no_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: java 11 had massive timeout issues
 Nerchio: did you get your shirt for russian ai cup euler 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020554RU">https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020554RU</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020727RU">https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020727RU</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i hate the German customs
 eulerscheZahl: also gave up hopes for TCO21 tshirt (don't have a tracking link)
 Nerchio: oh wow at least you have a tracking link
 eulerscheZahl: so the obvious solution is to qualify for on-site finals and pick it up in person at TCO
 Nerchio: I never saw anything 
 eulerscheZahl: i know Astro and Ille got theirs
 Nerchio: maybe I will get it in the next russian ai cup unless the organizers got drafted to the army
 eulerscheZahl: they already postponed indefinitely
 eulerscheZahl: was supposed to happen in february/march this time
 Nerchio: I don't know where you find this information I am literally in their discord
 Nerchio: :grimacing:
 jacek: hes on their celestia
 eulerscheZahl: probably telegram. got it from russian CG users
 jacek: those germans :unamused:
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 jacek: Automaton2000 when will you get your mail
 Automaton2000: how old are u guys
 Nerchio: old enough to be your dad Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: well, i have a good day
 Nerchio: what is the next contest about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you might have to be on the same cell, but a pac can't cross the path of a stronger pac: ...
 Nerchio: it's pacman again damn
 Darleanow: guys, how do we remove space at the end when we print a string&#160;?
 jacek: end=<i></i>
 jacek: or "".strip()
 Darleanow: yeah but it has no spaces between each now
 Darleanow: Trouvé&#160;: 23571113171923293137414347Attendu&#160;: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47
 5DN1L: join first
 5DN1L: strip later
 5DN1L: and join with space instead of empty string
 Darleanow: its in a list
 Darleanow: and i can print like that
 Darleanow: for i in lst:print(i)
 Darleanow: ,end=" "
 Darleanow: but it has space at end
 5DN1L: you can even print(*lst)
 Darleanow: GENIUS TY
 Darleanow: i was searching for something like
 Darleanow: this
 Darleanow: thanks sir &lt;3
 5DN1L: oh well, there are usually multiple ways to do the same thing
 5DN1L: it doesn't hurt to learn a few more ways
 5DN1L: " ".join(str(x) for x in lst)
 5DN1L: OR
 5DN1L: "".join(f"{x} " for x in lst).strip()
 5DN1L: and to revise your original code:
 5DN1L: for i in lst[:-1]:print(i,end=" ")print(lst[-1])
 Darleanow: oh this is smart too
 Darleanow: this is something similar that i used to do
 Darleanow: in a for loop i was printing t
 Darleanow: the list with a end=" "
 Darleanow: and when i was at n-1, i was breaking the loop and printing the last one
 5DN1L: yup, be flexible and you'll find many possibilities

 Darleanow: hello all&#160;:)
 R3KS: good day
 Darleanow: 3158
 Darleanow: need the top 1000
 Darleanow: ehhehe
 struct: contests give lots of points
 struct: I think rank 1 gets 10k
 struct: which game are you playing to get points Darleanow?
 Darleanow: no its for clahs
 Darleanow: need to reach top1000
 struct: ah
 Darleanow: this is so unfair to get fckd up by spaces at the end
 Darleanow: i hate that
 weebiss: hii
 Rock_You: hey
 mod0: hii
 Dren: hello there
 ChloeLeng: hi
 Darleanow: BobLob, waiting for u&#160;:)
 Darleanow: Hello Husoki tho&#160;:)
 Husoski: Hi Darleanow!  Which puzzle was killing you with trailing space checks?
 Darleanow: that's because i'm really bad at maths, and i found the formula for factorials
 Darleanow: but for a different base it was impossible to me 
 Husoski: Sounded like the Christmas Tree syndrome where the program wants "    ***" but the code is simpler for "   ***   ".
 Husoski: ...but factorials are the same in all bases.  n! = 1*2*3*,..*n.  Or were you looking for trailing zeroes in a factorial?
 Darleanow: indeed, it was trailing zeroes&#160;!
 ASM_MOV_INT: I love trailing zeroes!
 Darleanow: hate them - -'
 Dren: I prefer leading zeroes

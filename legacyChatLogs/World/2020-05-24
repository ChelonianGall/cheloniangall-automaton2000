 struct: scroll simulator is done
 eulerscheZahl: simulator? so you don't scroll for real?
 struct: It was a joke attempt for yinsh statement
 eulerscheZahl: I see, screenshots all over again
 eulerscheZahl: except for those with a strict company firewall
 struct: What does that mean?
 eulerscheZahl: some chatusers have imgur blocked
 struct: I see
 struct: I can put the images on folder and submit
 struct: but if it get aprooved ill need to change url
 struct: Should be simple though
 eulerscheZahl: i think the URL changes on every reupload. not entirely sure about it
 struct: ah
 struct: That makes it impossible I guess
 struct: Ill try on demo just to be sure
 struct: They dont change :D
 struct: But I uploaded 7 images
 struct: and only 6 show
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: oh its smart
 struct: it detects duplicates
 struct: 10/10
 struct: Fixed, now with CG links
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 cegprakash: hiii
 cegprakash: I'm about to start the continuation of yesterday's stream. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://twitch.tv/cegprakash</a>
 cegprakash: my stream has started
 Uljahn: im not streaming anything today, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: that could be a good way to test
 eulerscheZahl: yes Uljahn! how do you know if your equipment is working when you never use it?
 struct: 1/3
 struct: Now only 2 more :D
 struct: Now we only have to wait 13 months until I port another game
 eulerscheZahl: arimaa or another one?
 trictrac: Hello All, Struct&#160;: I approved yinsh the statement is OK
 jacek: is it ready to go then?
 trictrac: yes
 eulerscheZahl: up to you to decide jacek
 jacek: such power
 eulerscheZahl: now that you got level 20
 eulerscheZahl: finally
 jacek: i approved twixtpp
 eulerscheZahl: but now there is no XP reward anymore for approvals
 jacek: no motivation
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't expect that XP could be your motivation for it
 jacek: ah right
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a bot for twixtPP?
 jacek: only random one
 eulerscheZahl: not counting the dummy Java submit in the arena
 jacek: i hadnt motivation to bitboard it yet. if game isnt to be bitboarded, i dont play it :v
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a bitboard on onitama?
 jacek: of course
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't expect that answer
 jacek: you dont?
 eulerscheZahl: thought only smits got that crazy on it :D
 jacek: its just 25 bits
 jacek: cards moves were most tricky
 jacek: and i bet he got magic numbers allowing him to do things in 1 operation, while for me it is 3
 darkhorse64: I have also a bitboard (+ smth for the king) but I did not go the extra mile to fit everything in 64 bits
 darkhorse64: The hand also is not bitboarded
 jacek: yay for my lucky uttt resubmit
 cegprakash: top 46 and climbing using minimax
 cegprakash: anyone watching my stream?

 eulerscheZahl: trending?
 eulerscheZahl: forum shows 19 clicks in my post mortem

 eulerscheZahl: what's his CG nick?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, stupid me. look at the top
 eulerscheZahl: Romka :o
 Illedan: NIce
 eulerscheZahl: he saw my post mortem, cool
 eulerscheZahl: and he has his local visualizer too. i start seeing some similarities
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: what's ur depth in oware?
 eulerscheZahl: let me checkj
 eulerscheZahl: looking at my battle vs you cegprakash: 10-12 at the beginning, going up to 14-16 in late game
 kovi: he really played pac seiously
 eulerscheZahl: you don't get 2nd without trying hard
 eulerscheZahl: do you have local tooling kovi?
 kovi: nope&#160;:(
 cegprakash: I wonder how u achieved GA
 cegprakash: I thought minimax is the only way for oware
 kovi: at least this time i relied on local bench vs. self
 eulerscheZahl: when you did the setup once, you can reuse most of it
 eulerscheZahl: that is for offline replays at least
 eulerscheZahl: batches are often useless at some point
 kovi: yeah, that is nice.hopefully next game will be (almost) stateless
 eulerscheZahl: when it's totally off, it can help. or to detect obvious bugs
 jacek: GA in oware?
 eulerscheZahl: but for finetuning offline batches suck quite often
 kovi: interestingly it was quite reliable
 eulerscheZahl: isn't oware minimax, MCTS, NN at the top?
 kovi: just i was unable to validate in the end
 kovi: with huge randomness
 eulerscheZahl: and the contest always ends a day or 2 too late
 kovi: i think i was behind the whole weekend
 AntiSquid: "and the contest always ends a day or 2 too late" are you referring to the last weekend when everyone takes their best bot out of hiding?
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u did MCTS or GA?
 cegprakash: for oware?
 cegprakash: I did minimax at depth 7
 eulerscheZahl: i have a minimax
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid i'm referring to the fact that i almost always drop a few ranks on the last weekend
 eulerscheZahl: some are hiding, others just improving their bots
 jacek: i have around 10 depth in oware and 13-14 near end
 Astrobytes: Depth 0 for me
 jacek: w00t? go as new multi?
 eulerscheZahl: so many new games lately
 jacek: the algorithm of choice for go is minimax of course
 IAmNoob: hi
 wlesavo: cheating is bad iamnoob
 IAmNoob:&#160;???????
 IAmNoob: what have i done?
 Illedan: Where do we begin..
 wlesavo: well <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467917075">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467917075</a>
 IAmNoob: please explain me
 IAmNoob: all i saw was correct
 IAmNoob: and i swear i wont cheat
 IAmNoob: please look again
 IAmNoob: read the rules and all that stuff
 IAmNoob: got it?
 IAmNoob: P.S i worked hard for the gold league
 wlesavo: you have the same bot as the other guy, which means at least one of you didnt wrote it
 IAmNoob: let me look again
 IAmNoob: nope
 IAmNoob: the bots are close related 
 IAmNoob: but i saw that we were not in the same state
 IAmNoob: in the same situation
 wlesavo: come on
 IAmNoob: he was tanker
 IAmNoob: i was dest
 IAmNoob: in the same situation
 IAmNoob: please look again carefuly
 IAmNoob: and bring me a time lap or something to prove i cheated
 IAmNoob: 'cause i am 1500% i haven't cheat
 wlesavo: you just happen to print out the same messages in most of the time? nut it is only a single example. i dont need to prove anything, im just saying this is not the way to do it
 IAmNoob: and how am i suppose to cheat
 IAmNoob: pls explain
 wlesavo: by cheating i mean taking someone else code from git hub or elsewhere
 IAmNoob: dude
 IAmNoob: this is not fun
 IAmNoob: i had fun
 IAmNoob: building it with friends
 IAmNoob: I dont code for winning 
 IAmNoob: i code for fun
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468486318">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468486318</a>
 IAmNoob: i dont think u know
 IAmNoob: if you want to make a good code
 IAmNoob: you need to have tehniques
 IAmNoob: if you have tehniques
 IAmNoob: any other can have those too
 IAmNoob: so sorry if you think i cheat
 IAmNoob: i relly dont want you to think so
 Astrobytes: wlesavo lol, that kutulu replay
 IAmNoob: you know guys that there are many twitter pages where disscusions about tehniques happend
 IAmNoob: am i right or not
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: that looks like some noob-level cheating. there are way stronger bots on github
 IAmNoob: DUDE
 IAmNoob: thats why i say i dident cheat
 IAmNoob: all the bots are not good
 IAmNoob: my bots are trash
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't follow the discussion, just clicked 2 replays
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: i was saying
 IAmNoob: the my bots are way badder than 
 IAmNoob: scripts that exists
 tomatoes: dont get caught is a skill too
 IAmNoob: omg
 WINWINWIN: Maybe its because I havent done code of kutulu, but I dont see how you can accuse someone of cheating just by a replay
 tomatoes: same debug messages
 eulerscheZahl: same path taken over about 100 turns
 eulerscheZahl: that involves a lot of decisions
 WINWINWIN: But those LRUD (Left Right Up Down) seem pretty standard as debug messages
 IAmNoob: they are
 eulerscheZahl: depth 4 search and perfect match on plan
 Astrobytes: On exactly the same turns
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ Idk then, sry
 IAmNoob: look again
 IAmNoob: at the start
 IAmNoob: we havent the same decisions
 IAmNoob: and if the code was stolen
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have the same cell at the start
 IAmNoob: we must be one for the full game\
 IAmNoob: and this means more
 IAmNoob: eulerscheZahl
 IAmNoob: than why would we get in a common point?
 IAmNoob: if there were different initial conditions
 Snef: Hello o/
 eulerscheZahl: bots are likely to move towards each other. you lose less sanity in a group
 eulerscheZahl: but at some point your paths usually split at an intersection
 IAmNoob: mine not
 eulerscheZahl: one goes right to flee the wanderer, the other goes left
 jacek: snek
 IAmNoob: eulerscheZahl dont changes the path
 eulerscheZahl: hi Snef :wave:
 IAmNoob: and if his make the same
 kovi: nice improvement on sr snef
 IAmNoob: we have the same bot?
 kovi: it seems
 Quidome: wow, this kind of a discussion here is new to me... Can CG run a plagiat scan on the bot's maybe to sort this out?
 eulerscheZahl: sadly they only do on contests
 Quidome: aha
 Quidome: i was pleaseg with Thibaud in the contest&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: go to hypersonic, pick 4 random players at rank 10-100. you probably got a match of 4 kimiyuki clones
 Quidome: hm, I prefer CG would act on this
 eulerscheZahl: many would. totally no fun fighting that wall of SAYONARA
 eulerscheZahl: (bot says that when dying)
 Quidome:&#160;:)
 Snef: Thanks kovi
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468694555">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468694555</a> looks like 3 clones and 1 other bot breaking symmetry. just taken from last battles, should place a 4th clone to verify
 WINWINWIN: What does kimiyuki mean?
 WINWINWIN: hack into servers?
 eulerscheZahl: 3rd of the contest
 eulerscheZahl: published his bot, others using it
 WINWINWIN: Ohh nickname
 WINWINWIN: Meh doesnt affact me too much Im in Bronze :P
 IAmNoob: i havent tried:((
 IAmNoob: i why would u dont ban them or something
 IAmNoob: cant u?
 eulerscheZahl: only codingame can. and they don't
 eulerscheZahl: "multiplayer is a zoo"
 WINWINWIN: How did reCurse run His C++ code through python?
 WINWINWIN: Can I use that to gain performance in python?
 IAmNoob: no
 eulerscheZahl: compile offline, include binary in bot. write to disk and call the program, spawning a new process
 WINWINWIN: Ok
 Uljahn: with subprocess library?
 eulerscheZahl: how shall i know? does that detail even matter?
 WINWINWIN: Does reCurse have a post mortem where he explains how to use a neural network?
 eulerscheZahl: no. read pb on this
 IAmNoob: what is CBS?
 WINWINWIN: Coders Strike Back
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: thx
 Csipcsirip: coders bike strack

 AntiSquid: sorry, wrong link, use csip's :p
 Astrobytes: You do know there's a search bar at the top of the page WINWINWIN right?
 jacek: but is sucks
 AntiSquid: BUT there is a chat bar on the right, with lots of people in it
 Astrobytes: It's better than it used to be aty least jacek
 eulerscheZahl: but the top search is usually faster
 WINWINWIN: Lol chip clip
 AntiSquid: shouldn't we call smitsi by the original name btw&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: smitsimax has a nice ring to it :P
 AntiSquid: cadiaplayer or w/e
 Astrobytes: It's not *exactly* the same. Call it whatever you like. Little Bobby Tables Search, BunnySearch, Lots Of Trees Search, w/e you like
 AntiSquid: what is the difference AutomatonNN
 WINWINWIN: How about Forest search?
 AutomatonNN: Illedan is it a programmer?
 AntiSquid: bad timing, he isn't online
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN that might get confused with random forest
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ never knew there was such a thing
 Astrobytes: Every day's a school day
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 WINWINWIN: :D yes now that school has started it is literally true
 IAmNoob: not really every
 IAmNoob: day
 IAmNoob: 5/7

 AntiSquid: actually random forests isn't real ML, might be usable on CG&#160;?? 
 WINWINWIN: You have not met my english teacher :P

 WINWINWIN: What is that AntiSquid?
 Astrobytes: A youtube link
 AntiSquid: the link or the show&#160;?
 AntiSquid: listen carefully to the dialogue :p
 AntiSquid: was a joke
 IAmNoob: Astrobytes&#160;:))
 WINWINWIN: :D
 IAmNoob: why the f**k is the "last battle" list going so slowwwwwwwwwwwwww
 IAmNoob: i die before it ends
 IAmNoob: all the battles
 WINWINWIN: You have slow net :P
 IAmNoob: nope:)
 IAmNoob: ok it has ended
 IAmNoob: ok i mean i am happy i am in legend but why have i 4h to wait?
 WINWINWIN: Nice Legend&#160;:) which multi?
 IAmNoob: it makes 0% sense to me
 IAmNoob: WINWINWIN many:)))
 IAmNoob: i mean now i cant say 
 WINWINWIN: :D
 IAmNoob: i have to wait
 IAmNoob: to be in legend to say i am in legend
 IAmNoob: so
 IAmNoob: i think i'll go take a sleep
 Astrobytes: which multi
 IAmNoob: bye guys
 AntiSquid: dbdr is 500 the highest level in number shifting puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not
 Astrobytes: Must've found another bot on github
 AntiSquid: oh forgot you made it
 WINWINWIN: Thats mean Astrobytes
 IAmNoob: stfu
 Astrobytes: No now, no need to be rude
 IAmNoob: why do u think i cheat
 WINWINWIN: Calm down IAmNoob
 AntiSquid: dude calm down, just read the code and move on IAmNoob
 wlesavo: AntiSquid i think westicles working on it without submiting
 eulerscheZahl: and westicles recently reported a bug that will only occur beyond level 600. so it seems he's still working on it, just hasn't submitted
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm slow
 Astrobytes: You fixed that right tho' euler?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 20min after reporting
 wlesavo: nice bug btw
 eulerscheZahl: new how to fix it all the time but hoped i wouldn't have to :D
 eulerscheZahl: new =&gt; knew
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: what bug?
 wlesavo: to many moves
 wlesavo: too
 eulerscheZahl: solution takes too many actions, exceeding the 30s limit
 eulerscheZahl: so now i read 2 actions at once
 wlesavo: would that be enough for 1000?
 pajken: Anyone a Skynet ep2 wizard? Thought I had this but seems not...
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 had his degree in Skynet episodes
 Automaton2000: you could try to use the same code
 eulerscheZahl: 2 commands per turn should get you around 1200. but running out of levels before
 pajken: Maybe should have eased into this and started with something simpler, but now I'm to stubborn to give up&#160;:/ Can someone point me in a general direction on what to read up on for the skynet parts?
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl just noticed someone took your #1 in Connect 4
 eulerscheZahl: i know...made me realize my bot is suddenly timing out (never did that before). even lowering the time limit from 90ms to 50ms causes some occasional timeouts
 BALEK: In search race, why is there 2 turns per turn&#160;? the input for the second turn is always "2.0"  :thinking:
 Illedan: 2 turns per turn?
 Illedan: no inputs are 2.0?
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN 04:01PMIlledan is it a programmer?
 eulerscheZahl: as you missed it
 AutomatonNN: got 3 problems and i never did it
 Illedan: Oh, AutomatonNN..
 AutomatonNN: what are you making a sim
 eulerscheZahl: only 2 inputs if there are &gt; 2 numbers left obviously
 Illedan: AutomatonNN playing search race?
 AutomatonNN: why do you play it to play on the game?
 BALEK: Illedan, i don't know how to say, but for 1 turn, there is two loops, the first one is with the good input (checkpointindex, x, y, vx ...), and on the second loop the input is just "2.0"
 Illedan: Can you send me your code in a PM?
 Counterbalance: that's the debug output from the referee - the collision time
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: BALEK, do you print "debug" in your message?
 Illedan: This will cause you to get debug inputs :P
 BALEK: oh, yes i print debug  :hushed:
 Illedan: Thx Counterbalance
 wlesavo: lol, nice
 BALEK: thanks :grin:
 Counterbalance: sorry I butted in, you ofc know exactly how it works&#160;;)
 Illedan: Ofc, but I'm a little to tierd to remember that tiny part :D
 struct: Buying approvals
 eulerscheZahl: you ruined his secret plan to get a stronger bot
 eulerscheZahl: that's not how approval process is supposed to work
 Illedan: I see Marchete added morse code for Torture on 1 of them :D
 AntiSquid: 1 approval = 3 AutomatonNN nudes and we have a deal struct
 AutomatonNN: he is a coder that get a contest and the rest is still there
 AntiSquid: oh actually looks nice and you have options to switch viewer settings
 struct: I was joking though, I dont want to rush approoval
 AntiSquid: nah, it's ok, i approve this one
 AntiSquid: wasn't joking about the nudes though
 AntiSquid: even submitted a working bot in D
 struct: It works?
 AntiSquid: and beat snef with it
 AntiSquid: and euler too
 struct: I guess I need to fix referee then, no D allowed
 AntiSquid:  /ban
 AntiSquid: #3
 AntiSquid: even has referee link at the top
 AntiSquid: don't need to scroll down and search
 eulerscheZahl: chat about to go down?
 eulerscheZahl: chat is back
 AntiSquid: hi, is chat back yet?
 struct: yes
 AntiSquid: for got to add /ss = sorry for my bad English
 AntiSquid: forgot *
 eulerscheZahl: you added /s in a for loop?
 inoryy: a loop from "got" to "add /s"
 struct: is ru fixed inoryy?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, fixed
 eulerscheZahl: as written on #ru (in English)
 WINWINWIN: Whats with the giant wait between league promotions?
 reCurse: Leaves you time to go outside
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl how to go to higher depth on oware?
 cegprakash: what kind of pruning do u do
 Astrobytes: Just go alphabeta and optimise the hell out of everything ceg
 Astrobytes: Also, what you eval (and especially their coefficients!) are extremely important.
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://localboyfrommadurai.blogspot.com/2014/03/my-ai-tron-bot-2014.html">https://localboyfrommadurai.blogspot.com/2014/03/my-ai-tron-bot-2014.html</a>
 Astrobytes: And when I had an a/b on there I did some basic move ordering once per turn
 Astrobytes: You should be able to get to around depth 13 iirc
 jacek: tranposition table, sorting etc
 Astrobytes: Didn't use a TT on Oware when I had my a/b actually
 Moha: hi i was using old python in codes can't i get it bacK?
 darkhorse64: Top 4 are NN and MCTS. Choose the right weapon&#160;!
 jacek: maybe i should work on bitboarding the oware after all
 Astrobytes: And double check that you have implemented all the rules properly too cegprakash
 darkhorse64: I doubled my rollouts # when converting to bitboard 
 Astrobytes: I never got around to bitboarding it, I had to leave it alone for a while :D
 cegprakash: Astrobytes I've all the rules properly
 cegprakash: I just don't know how to do pruning in this&#160;:\
 jacek: do you have any sorting in your a/b?
 Csipcsirip: why dont you try mcts
 Astrobytes: Scroll up, I gave you some tips
 Astrobytes: cegprakash
 cegprakash: u have 6 moves and u sort them based on something?
 cegprakash: and how many do u choose out off the 6
 Astrobytes: eval them and sort based on that
 cegprakash: well that can work
 cegprakash: do u prune only enemy
 jacek: i sort them by killer move, then by move from transposition table from earlier iteration
 cegprakash: I don't want to prune myself
 jacek: huh
 Alshock: @darkhorse64 couldn't one do a MCTS with the result of the NN? Like instead of pure random sim?
 Astrobytes: Just standard alphabeta cegprakash
 cegprakash: and I don't know how to run a minimax for custom depth
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 jacek: iterative deepening
 cegprakash: minimax is like dfs
 struct: if(detph == N) return eval()
 cegprakash: so some paths can take long time
 cegprakash: and can have large depths
 cegprakash: I don't know how to control the depth
 darkhorse64: When I say NN, it actually means run an MCTS and eval the position with an NN
 cegprakash: should I use BFS?
 Alshock: @darkhorse64 aw ok then
 cegprakash: ID?
 Astrobytes: So you can have a fixed depth and cutoff if time limit exceeds or you can deepen iteratively
 darkhorse64: cegprakash: all these improvements require iterative deepening
 Astrobytes: Iterative deepening
 Astrobytes: Not hard to implement cegprakash, you can do it
 Alshock: does that necessarily mean queueing?
 jacek: no
 Alshock: kk
 struct: Illedan I dont like logos&#160;:(
 jacek: huh
 cegprakash: Iterative deepening? BFS?
 ZarthaxX: just google iterative deepening
 Astrobytes: and alphabeta minimax
 ZarthaxX: it's a way of mixing dfs with bfs idea, you do dfs to depth X, then if u finish you try depth X+1, and so on until you run out of time
 ZarthaxX: and the good thing is that you can reuse things from last depth
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: yo Zarthigator
 struct: So I can do like minimax depth N, and then expand it further?
 struct: Or is this wrong
 jacek: you just do loop while(timeLeft) { bestMove = minimax(level); level++ }
 Astrobytes: Start at depth 0, if you succeed and don't time out, then depth++
 ZarthaxX: Astrogator 
 struct: ah I see
 ZarthaxX: Astronomus
 struct: Now I must try mcts
 struct: I need to try to fix it
 Astrobytes: I like that last one Zarthonite
 jacek: fix where
 ZarthaxX: Astronymus
 ZarthaxX: my pleasure
 struct: uttt
 struct: My mcts is bad
 jacek: aww
 struct: Its wrong
 struct: but top 50
 struct: I do select expand select expand select expand ...
 struct: until end node
 struct: :p
 jacek: no rollout?
 struct: yeah no rollout
 jacek: and no out of memory errors?
 WINWINWIN: I tried studying a bit of minimax, and I do not understand how it can be applied to tron battle
 struct: nope
 struct: I expand up to 12 Mill of nodes per turn though
 cegprakash: jacek ur's looks like a BFS
 struct: Its bad I think, so I wouldnt try it jace k
 jacek: technically it could be bfs
 Astrobytes: cegprakash read what ZarthaxX said
 struct: Let me profile my uttt
 struct: to see how bad it is
 jacek: i jsut got my lucky resubmit
 jacek: dont ruint it
 cegprakash: I'll watch youtube on iterative depening
 Astrobytes: It's really not complicated cegprakash, you'll get it pretty quickly
 struct: CG down?
 struct: oh its fine 
 Uljahn: for ID, should the results of achieved depth be sorted for better performance in case of alpha-beta prunning?
 Astrobytes: That's move ordering, and you can if needed
 jacek: i use transposition table for that and try moves that were best in previous iterations. usualy they cause more cutoff

 jacek: :tada:
 cegprakash: looks like I need to have my own stack instead of using the recursion stack
 cegprakash: but how do I handle timeouts
 cegprakash: :o
 cegprakash: like should I run half the time to expand depth
 cegprakash: then use remaining time to to collect the results and come back to depth 0
 jacek: check time at every minimax call and throw TimeoutException

 struct: I forgot to allow for players to print messages on Yinsh
 struct: ups
 jacek: phew i havent gotten approved it yet
 struct: I wonder if I should increase time
 struct: 100ms, do you think is enough?
 struct: its at 100ms atm
 Snef: struct o/
 Snef: 100 ms is enough
 Snef: and come search Race&#160;:
 Snef: 
 struct: I want but intel intrisics page is always breaking for me&#160;:(
 struct: I dont know hy
 struct: why*
 Snef: start without avx&#160;?
 struct: I guess I can do that
 struct: make perfect sim
 struct: then port
 Astrobytes: That'll be a first :P
 Snef: still waiting for you Astrobytes btw :p
 Astrobytes: I'll be there soon Snef, by midweek anyway, hopefully
 Snef: noice
 Astrobytes: I've created the VS project, so technically I've started
 Astrobytes: :P
 Snef: do you have a search for csb already&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Snef: it will be quick then :p
 Astrobytes: It's just annoying to have to go through it all. I don't know whether to reuse or rewrite. I'll try reusing first obvs
 Snef: yeah depend on your code, mine was not so bad so i could easily remove the parts i didn't wanted
 Astrobytes: Mine isn't awful, but it is messy and I have to be careful not to break things :DReused some for BR and broke things easily :D
 struct: How many sims, I must know
 Astrobytes: On CSB or BR? And me or Snef?
 struct: SR
 jacek: yes
 struct: anyone
 Astrobytes: 0. No search :P
 Snef: 1.1-&gt;1.5M
 Counterbalance: 300k&#160;:(
 struct: What are you doing counter?
 Snef: Counterbalance 300k for one turn or for a depth*turn&#160;?
 Counterbalance: per sim, as the referee defines a sim
 Counterbalance: depth 5 at current, so 60k per 'rollout'
 Snef: ok
 Counterbalance: you using avx to get 1-1.5m?
 Snef: no
 Snef: and i'm pretty sure i have still improvement to do but i'm not advanced enough in c++ for that
 Astrobytes: GA?
 Snef: yea
 Counterbalance: a lot of time goes into the scoring though, using atan2 etc..
 Astrobytes: Yeah, same for my CSB. Keep meaning to get around to smitsi but... ach
 Snef: maybe try a simplier eval
 Snef: Counterbalance on SR&#160;?
 Counterbalance: also the round/ceil/floor steps are somewhat heavy
 Counterbalance: yeah
 jacek: or faster atan2
 Snef: in sr there is no more round
 struct: Guys the angle never gets rounded or truncated does it?
 Counterbalance: 1 hour ago there is
 Counterbalance: here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Utility.java#L11">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Utility.java#L11</a>
 Astrobytes: From Illeda n in the forum:Angles are rounded.Position is truncatedSpeed is truncated.
 Counterbalance: i got a sim error when I didn't mplement that - the velocity was off by 1
 Counterbalance: x was 167.999999994, referee said it was 168, my old sim said 167
 struct: I dont see angles rounded anywhere in the referee
 Astrobytes: Pff. Blame Illeda n :D
 Illedan: I took it from BR
 Illedan: Where it really mattered
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: But it prevents rounding errors :P
 Illedan: And is more right
 Illedan: Just slower
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/ea91c425f22966c8c4d38933763b006a3319b507/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Car.java#L125">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/ea91c425f22966c8c4d38933763b006a3319b507/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Car.java#L125</a> angle rounding
 struct: thanks
 Counterbalance: still having a hard time calculating the difference between 2 angles :sweat_smile:
 Snef: i don't think it matter a lot tho
 Illedan: Counterbalance, I googled that yesterday :P
 Snef: my angles are intat end of turn i cast x,y,vx,vy as int to truncate
 Counterbalance: nah.. i just wanted a perfect sim, and off by 1 can mean not hitting a CP
 Snef: i still get sub 11k
 Counterbalance: Illedan hm good idea&#160;:)
 Snef: Couterbalance to counter that my cp hve radius of 599
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2748dd44-dbbf-4868-92c1-34343caa18cb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2748dd44-dbbf-4868-92c1-34343caa18cb</a>
 Illedan: Copy pasta and never look back
 Counterbalance: hm i use radians&#160;;)
 Illedan: Easier to cache sin/cos results with degrees&#160;;)
 Counterbalance: true
 Counterbalance: i was preparing to step away from EXPERT if I needed more accurate angles
 Illedan: aha
 351062: Illedan: would you consider changing the debug mode to something similar to CSB, with the speed vector length changing&#160;?
 Illedan: Let me take a look at in CSB
 Snef: there is also the "aiming" line from csb i don't know if it can be usefull
 Illedan: I can give that one 1 more try
 Neumann: reCurse: is your SR online or offline search&#160;?
 YurkovAS: Snef checkpoint radius 600 work better than 599
 Snef: Yurkov with radius 600 i can miss it
 Neumann: Fix your engine
 Astrobytes: Such laziness :P
 Snef: Neumann isn't it the same for you&#160;?
 Neumann: I don't miss CP with radius 600
 Neumann: You used your CSB engine&#160;?
 Neumann: There's a few differences
 Snef: yea i used it but i changed angles to be int as we discussed it before
 Snef: also should i replace all my float by double 
 Neumann: The positions are truncated at the of the turn here, while they are rounded in CSB
 YurkovAS: Snef i'm use int for angle and float for x, vx...
 Snef: i change that Neumann
 Snef: changed *
 Neumann: Ok
 kovi: i have used 599 is csb, but 600 here
 Snef: but Counterbalance linked a function called truncate() that round args
 Snef: which is in referee
 Illedan: It is rounded if the value is closer to a whole value than EPSILON.
 Snef: do you have that Neumann&#160;?
 Neumann: Nope
 Snef: so there is stilla chance you miss cp no&#160;?
 MostComplicatedUsername: We have to have a team for the fall challenge?
 Neumann: I haven't noticed any miss so far
 Neumann: Unless the ones due to retarded bugs
 Neumann: Except *
 struct: Was gonna try to fix zoom module, then I saw the size of the  file :scream:
 AntiSquid: struct add cover picture to yinsh
 struct: ok
 struct: omg the picture must be 16:9
 Illedan: You can crop it in the editor
 struct: :thumbsup:
 MostComplicatedUsername: In bandas, are the lines given from top to bottom?
 MostComplicatedUsername: nvm
 jacek: yes
 AbdelkrimBournane: Hey guys, what's up 
 jacek: sky
 AbdelkrimBournane: The ceiling, we are home!!
 jacek: struct so there will be message or not?
 cegprakash: I just added pruning
 cegprakash: in oware
 cegprakash: but I still do a constant depth
 Astrobytes: as in alpha beta?
 cegprakash: increased my depth from 7 to 10
 cegprakash: yes
 Astrobytes: Cool
 Astrobytes: Nice one
 Astrobytes: Did you try ordering your moves?
 jacek: wait, you even didnt have alpha beta pruning?
 cegprakash: yes I do
 cegprakash: int prune[20] = { 5, 5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 };
 cegprakash: pick top prune[dep] moves at every depth
 cegprakash: No jacek just added
 jacek: and are you higher in rank?
 cegprakash: I didn't do iterative deepening yet
 cegprakash: 17% battles are in progress
 Astrobytes: Lower it seems
 Astrobytes: Oh sorry, my bad
 cegprakash: 35 and climbing
 Astrobytes: Didn't realise submit was still ongoing&#160;:)
 struct: should do a mcts next cegprakash
 struct: maybe in other multi
 cegprakash: yeah I plan MCTS for UTTT
 Astrobytes: I use an MCTS variant for Oware, as do others ceg
 jacek: with ept?
 Astrobytes: Yea
 jacek: how early
 Astrobytes: 0
 cegprakash: does my code look okay or ugly?
 Alshock: is depth global?
 jacek: is this alpha beta?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: depth = 10
 cegprakash: yes jacek
 cegprakash: I prune by goodmoves
 cegprakash: int prune[20] = { 5, 5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 };
 Astrobytes: Odd looking alpha beta
 jacek: umm
 jacek: you prune 'manually'? thats not so alphabeta
 ZarthaxX: he found out new ways of minmax
 ZarthaxX: :O
 Astrobytes: cegimax
 cegprakash: what? lol
 jacek: the recursive function should have 2 new parameters, alpha and beta. ab should return the same move as minimax, but does it faster
 cegprakash: ab?
 Astrobytes: inline float search(State&amp; s, int depth, float alpha, float beta, int player)
 jacek: alphabeta
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning</a>
 ZarthaxX: thanks Astrobytes&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: better than explaining
 Astrobytes: Right?&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: Astreacher
 Astrobytes: Sounds too much like ASs-reacher Zarthoxide
 ZarthaxX: lmaooo
 Astrobytes: Teachobytes
 cegprakash: so what I do now is a ceg_prune + maximax
 cegprakash: not proper alpha beta pruning
 Astrobytes: I'm not entirely sure what that is but it's most definitely not an mm with a/b
 ZarthaxX: just your own creation
 cegprakash: how is my creation worser than a minimax&#160;:\
 cegprakash: may be my pruning is bad
 ZarthaxX: because it doesnt make any sense 
 Astrobytes: It's nice to be original sometimes but it's also nicer to be correct
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 JBM: or at least fast
 ZarthaxX: cegprakash try prunning without losing solutions
 ZarthaxX: basically alphabeta
 ZarthaxX: :P
 cegprakash: what does it do&#160;:( wiki pseudo code is complicated.. let me watch some video
 jacek: so youre lower in ranking. it seems worse
 cegprakash: is it possible to do alpha beta pruning on maximax?
 JBM: not with that name
 jacek: whats maximax :exploding_head:
 struct: ceg wait
 struct: i have perfect video for alpha beta
 JBM: wait not at all actually
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI</a>
 Astrobytes: why tf you want to maximax?
 jacek: to maximize ranking, duh
 Astrobytes: lol
 cegprakash: maximax is ez to implement 
 cegprakash: I don't need to do min anywhere
 Alshock: we don't want to minimize our efforts
 Astrobytes: Maximax is how young children play games
 Alshock: we just want the very best
 cegprakash: maximax gives same result as minimax
 Astrobytes: I give up
 cegprakash: and it's easy to code
 Alshock: when the opponent is played by you yes
 struct: wtf is maximax?
 Alshock: well by the name of it it maximizes the maximum gain? :P
 JBM: crazy gre8t new alg by ceg
 Astrobytes: Honestly ceg, we're trying to help you learn here
 struct: I try to help
 JBM: don't do that
 struct: but sundenly he seems to troll
 JBM: he obviously doesn't want it
 cegprakash: say I play at depth 0
 cegprakash: and I end at depth 10
 JBM: you can't really play at any other depth
 cegprakash: now I compute a score at depth 1-
 cegprakash: depth 10*
 cegprakash: and I would have scores of all moves at depth 10
 cegprakash: now at depth 9 what happens is
 cegprakash: opponent will have my scores
 jacek: on negamax you dont need min :v
 cegprakash: now instead of trying to minimize my score
 cegprakash: what he'll do is
 cegprakash: oh yes
 Astrobytes: Don't confuse him jacek
 cegprakash: it's called negamax
 cegprakash: not maximax
 cegprakash: my bad
 jacek: x_X
 cegprakash: what I do is negamax
 jacek: ok, alpha beta works with negamax
 cegprakash: now how do I prune with negamax
 Astrobytes: alpha beta
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax#Negamax_with_alpha_beta_pruning">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax#Negamax_with_alpha_beta_pruning</a>
 Astrobytes: It's exactly the same algo just written slightly differently
 jacek: though each time you call -alphabeta(-player,-beta,-alpha)
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: It's shorter and more convenient
 AbundantPuddle: That's what she said
 Astrobytes: lol
 cegprakash: she?
 cegprakash: there's a girl here?
 cegprakash: :o
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 struct: yes, im a girl
 jacek: that would explaing those deleting
 MostComplicatedUsername: cegprakash I'm a girl
 cegprakash: wow
 struct: once yinsh gets aprooved
 struct: i delete
 Astrobytes: It's a colloquial expression for a double entendre cegprakash
 Astrobytes: The UK one is "said the actress to the bishop"
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, that clears that up.
 AbundantPuddle: Oh really? That's the UK equivalent? I've never heard that before.
 Alshock: me neither
 struct: play yinsh ceg

 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's an old one. We still use "that's what she said" too though
 cegprakash: there is no move ordering in minimax
 cegprakash: for alpha beta pruning
 ZarthaxX: u can add that
 cegprakash: but for negamax it says I need to add ordering
 AbundantPuddle: I'm going to start using "said the actress to the bishop." Nobody will understand, but hoping it catches on.
 Astrobytes: Just for now ceg, ordering your available moves once by eval score for each turn, before you iterate over them and call minimax would probably give an improvement
 cegprakash: that's what I'm doing already
 Astrobytes: OK. Just stop with your strange pruning array
 cegprakash: I am slow learner. Let me watch some more videos to understand what alpha and beta are actually doing
 Astrobytes: Dude, read the wikipedia article, it's extremely clear
 Astrobytes: Don't just look at the pseudocode and go "oh I don't get that"
 Astrobytes: You and your impatience, seriously&#160;;)
 jacek: struct move generation? amateur <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/CodinGame-paper-soccer/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/paper_soccer/MoveCalculator.java#L16">https://github.com/jdermont/CodinGame-paper-soccer/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/paper_soccer/MoveCalculator.java#L16</a>
 cegprakash: does alpha beta pruning takes does sacrifices now to win the game later?
 ZarthaxX: jacek what is that
 ZarthaxX: D:
 jacek: alpha beta will not prune relevant moves. its just faster variant of minimax
 Astrobytes: The alpha beta only works with the score you give it from your eval ceg, it's up to you what you evaluate
 jacek: ZarthaxX you liek?
 Astrobytes: It sets thresholds for the scores
 ZarthaxX: what
 Astrobytes: If the score of a move isn't better than the threshold, it won't continue on that branch
 ZarthaxX: its a huge generation
 Astrobytes: Zarthaxia, send halp
 jacek: "its huge" thats what she said
 ZarthaxX: loooooooooool
 Astrobytes: Said the actress to the bishop
 Astrobytes: Are my minimax/alpha beta explanations bad? I know I'm on strong painkillers but I still feel mentally competent?

 jacek: :tada:
 Astrobytes: There's nothing in that video we haven't told you
 cegprakash: love u struct
 Astrobytes: In future ceg - don't ask for advice on chat. Just search on youtube :P
 ZarthaxX: he just doesnt read us
 TheDude75: da
 TheDude75: oops
 cegprakash: u never show me a diagram
 Astrobytes: It's not just my poor explanation then ZarthaxX? (Zarthonator)
 cegprakash: u said use alpha beta
 Astrobytes: FFS man, draw them yourself
 cegprakash: struct showed me what's alpha beta
 ZarthaxX: dont bother anymore 
 ZarthaxX: you are cool Astrobytes
 ZarthaxX: lmao the ( name )
 Astrobytes: Dude, when I learned it I drew out game trees on paper and shit
 jacek: thats stinky

 cegprakash: that's rude
 cegprakash: wtf
 Astrobytes: When trying to explain things
 cegprakash: and u used caps
 Astrobytes: (I only meant to on the 'THE')
 Astrobytes: Just for emphasis.
 <b>**Astrobytes tries to be nice - fails. Tries to explain - fails. Fail.</b></p><p><img src="/a/43431408633599" /> AbundantPuddle: Sometimes when things are explained just slightly differently, it just so happens to click with somebody that way. Me personally, I know I'm more of a visual and hands on learner. Somebody could explain something to me for hours and I still might not understand until I see and try it myself.
 Astrobytes: We've been attempting that for over an hour now
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX/Zarthoman save me
 AbundantPuddle: Lmfao. Well ceg seems to understand now, so that's all that matters. I'm sure he is greatful for everyone who has been assisting him. Right, ceg?
 Astrobytes: I also learn by doing AbundantPuddle, but I try to watch and read about it first, and take advice.
 cegprakash: yes yes
 cegprakash: ofc AbundantPuddle
 Astrobytes: cegprakash, the MIT lectures on game theory and associated algorithms are really good
 Astrobytes: Well, search algo theory
 cegprakash: well I saw pseudocode and it was like "wew what in the world is this" then I read what it says "meh but I don't understand"
 cegprakash: that's why I like youtube

 AbundantPuddle: I agree Astrobytes. I feel you should always be willing to learn from others. I have learned a lot from many others' experiences.
 Astrobytes: And do some stuff on paper/whiteboard, it'll really get into your head
 Illedan: cegprakash, MinMax search race?
 Astrobytes: 100% AbundantPuddle
 cegprakash: ur bugs fixed Illedan?
 Illedan: what bugs?
 Illedan: no such thing
 cegprakash: ppl were saying cars are spinning
 cegprakash: yesterday
 AbundantPuddle: They're not bugs, they're features.
 cegprakash: like in crossing two checkpoints on same turn 
 Illedan: That is fixed
 Astrobytes: Illedan seems to have a case of feature creep with SR&#160;:)
 cegprakash: is there collision in search race?
 Astrobytes: Only with the checkpoint
 Astrobytes: No bouncing
 cegprakash: wow
 cegprakash: then I'll defnitely do
 cegprakash: once I learn pruning
 cegprakash: and what does minimax has to do with search race
 Astrobytes: :joy:
 cegprakash: there is no opponent
 Illedan: haha :D
 Illedan: MaxMax
 Astrobytes: ceg, activate Troll-o-meter now
 cegprakash: I almost fall for the trap
 Alshock: is it over 9000 yet?
 Alshock: said the bishop to the brazilian?
 AbundantPuddle: Did the actress give the bishop a brazilian?
 AlMag: quick question - im playing ultimate tic tac toe. Currently wood league. How to progress to other leagues? i am in top 3 - it's not enough?
 MoMaT: AlMag, you need to be number 0.
 AbundantPuddle: I'm not entirely sure about that one specifically, but I believe in every league, you have to make it to rank 1 by defeating the boss to move on to the next league.
 MoMaT: that is higher in the rank than the boss :P
 Astrobytes: You need more points than the boss
 Astrobytes: So you have to be able to beat most of the others and have a decent winrate against the boss
 cegprakash: copy pasting from wiki doesn't seem to work :D
 cegprakash: may be I have bugs
 cegprakash: :D
 Astrobytes: It's the wiki. Clearly bugged.
 Astrobytes: :P
 cegprakash: or opponent has better eval&#160;:\ 
 cegprakash: I am at depth 12 now with pruning
 cegprakash: negamax + alpha beta
 Astrobytes: That's cool, what are you eval'in though - it's really important in Oware
 Astrobytes: *evaluating
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cac73638-4722-4868-9d17-4bfdca3c81af">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cac73638-4722-4868-9d17-4bfdca3c81af</a>
 cegprakash: i try to maximize the score and seeds on my side
 cegprakash: with priority to score
 Astrobytes: For starters, that's quite inefficient with all those loops, you only need one (or none if you go all fancy bitboards). Also, there are other parameters to consider
 Astrobytes: I would recommend a google search on Oware/Awalé scoring
 Astrobytes: If you find a few articles via google they will give you a good place to start eval-wise

 Astrobytes: You were scoring higher previously
 cegprakash: yeah&#160;:\ it shouldn't be lower because I had the same eval
 Astrobytes: Just a bug in your implementation, you'll work it out
 Alshock: @Astrobytes best eval is no eval when you don't know the subtilities of the game imho
 Astrobytes: But please do yourself a favour and google Oware/Awalé evals
 Alshock: subtleties?
 Alshock: I can't even spell basic words anymore
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: It's that time of the day y'know
 Alshock: 4th beer past 15 cL already?
 Astrobytes: Believe me, for Oware, eval is very important
 AlMag: Astrobytes, thanks man! Boss is now defeated!&#160;;)
 cegprakash: found the bug
 Alshock: I trust you on that one&#160;;)
 YurkovAS: In optimization, when submit, code tested with distinct cpus?
 Astrobytes: gj AlMag, well done
 YurkovAS: Find 3 distinc cpu: Intel Haswell 
 Astrobytes: I thiiiink it's different from the multi servers YurkovAS - reCurse?
 YurkovAS: Find when testing in optimization
 Astrobytes: Yes, you get different ones on multis too, but afaik the optim games are on different machines to the multis
 cegprakash: what is ur depth Astrobytes?
 AlMag: If i moved to a new league, can i send code to the previous league? I want to improve there, but don't know how to switch
 Astrobytes: Depth is 0. I use MCTS w/ EPT. When I had minimax a/b it was 13 iirc cegprakash
 Astrobytes: It still builds a tree, but I don't rollout, I just eval
 Astrobytes: This submit is much better now cegprakash, now you have to fix your eval
 cegprakash: yea
 cegprakash: I'm only at depth 11
 cegprakash: but my eval is also slow as I have a loop inside it
 Astrobytes: That's OK, just eval the right parameters
 Astrobytes: With the right eval you can be higher than your are with depth 11
 Astrobytes: *you are
 Astrobytes: *with a better eval

 YurkovAS: Resubmiting same code give distinct scoring (and fails sometime). Onetime this give me +250 score.
 Snef: +250 or -250&#160;?
 YurkovAS: +250
 Illedan: Is your sim 100%?
 BeardedWhale: Yeah, mine fluctuates with somehing like 300 between submits.
 BeardedWhale: And randomly fails
 Snef: if your search have random it's logic
 Snef: the fails tho..
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS was wondering about the CPUs on the machines
 Illedan: Yeah, some have said they have to use 35 ms to "fix" the fails..
 YurkovAS: Snef yes, use randoms with fixed seed
 Snef: yea me too
 BeardedWhale: I use fixed seed, but since the searchtime is somewhat random, the results still vary somewhat.

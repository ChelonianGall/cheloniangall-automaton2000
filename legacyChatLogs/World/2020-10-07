 BrokenKitten_d58:&#160;????
 BrokenKitten_d58: hi hi 
 Allis: @Jef808 Which one?
 Allis: Just checked your profile out of curiosity. There aren't any bots following you, but you're following four. :sweat_smile:
 Jef808: Lol you're right I was following bots how did this happen :flushed: Now I'm I'm thinking I didn't check if this person wasn't just trolling with his profile nvm :grin: :flushed:
 Phurinat: lol
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: you are killing my perfect haskell solving actually (86% for space maze, sokoban not started yet)&#160;:)
 MSmits: space maze is notorious for being hard to solve within the time limit
 MSmits: it's probably possible with slow languages if you use a really efficient algorithm
 matamasa: hello
 MSmits: hi
 jacek: good morning
 jacek: so, how many plies solved in oware
 jacek: Automaton2000 why onitama is so hard
 Automaton2000: yeah, but it doesn't look like that for the next contest will be a lot slower
 PrivatePirate_33ce: Hi, im a beginner can i ask how can you explain the code for the power of thor episode 1
 Q12: Hey, can somebody help me solve a problem that connected to arrays reference in ANEO Sponsored Puzzle? I looked in google and nothing helps me to solve it.
 KiwiTae: sure
 KiwiTae: Q12 whats your issue?
 jacek: PrivatePirate_33ce theres hint on the left
 MSmits: hi jacek, i dont have plies solved, unless you mean the end game book. In that case I have a 4GB database of all 15 seed states for all 200 turns ( the result may be different on different turns)
 MSmits: so any state with 15 seeds or less  I solved
 MSmits: but the meta mcts search goes 50 plies deep in some cases
 MSmits: the book makes my bot unstable though, sometimes i have 90% winrate vs recurse and then i search 1 ply deeper and i go down to 10%
 MSmits: there is a lot of "1 mistake = loss" going on
 MSmits: I am currently trying some negamax versions for onitama and maybe later othello, breakthrough etc. Since I finally found out how to do transpositions effectively
 jacek: mhm
 Zenoscave: euler how many moves per turn do you output in 2048?
 jacek: woah what a discount <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.amazon.de/Apple-Mac-Pro-Wheels-Kit/dp/B0875VYRPB?language=pl_PL&amp;tag=pepperpl09-21">https://www.amazon.de/Apple-Mac-Pro-Wheels-Kit/dp/B0875VYRPB?language=pl_PL&amp;tag=pepperpl09-21</a>
 AntiSquid: zeno first in 2048 already? :o
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what do you want to make it a bit more
 darkhorse64: Nearly 500K points per test&#160;! How many moves does it take to score so much
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: didn't really get into this, but do i need to reverse the random gen myself to predict it?&#160;:/
 TrapRNotGay: do any of you guys know how to input a c-optimization flag into the online console?
 Westicles: #pragma GCC optimize "O3,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 TrapRNotGay: thank you, my code still timed out, but thanks either way.
 wlesavo: AntiSquid there is a link to git hub
 AntiSquid: darkhorse64 is using same strategy as me?
 darkhorse64: I would not call it a strategy but yes. Next step is to write the engine and maybe start choosing moves with MC
 darkhorse64: Yes, you need to read the referee to mimic tile generation but hey, it's not the MeanMax sim
 darkhorse64: ULR &gt; UDLR
 sunksuperset370: hello
 sunksuperset370: does any one know how you can get past collision in coders strike back
 sunksuperset370: i am bronze league
 sunksuperset370: :thinking:
 darkhorse64: You mean, do you have inputs that describe collisions&#160;? The answer is no
 sunksuperset370: nono
 Shadowtick: hello everyone
 sunksuperset370: i created a code that will check if the opponent is in between me and the checkpoint
 sunksuperset370: if it is i will log for the opponent
 sunksuperset370: if not i will log for the check point
 Shadowtick: wow that's neat
 sunksuperset370: but the whole thing is just logging 0, 0
 sunksuperset370: i had to remove the thrust function if the angle of my pod is off
 sunksuperset370: to increase thrust or decreace it
 Shadowtick: I don't know if I could code that
 sunksuperset370: nono
 sunksuperset370: its just checking if the x and the y positions are in which spot
 sunksuperset370: if 
 Shadowtick: but I did make something neat in p5.js
 sunksuperset370: xpod me&gt; xpod op
 sunksuperset370: or ypod me&lt; ypod op
 darkhorse64: My advice: aim as fast as possible to the next checkpoint. Ignore oppoents
 Shadowtick: ok
 sunksuperset370: its just a lot of those
 MSmits: you can get to gold without worrying about collisions
 sunksuperset370: i did that before but the opponent is doing the same thing
 Shadowtick: wanna see something I made in p5.js?
 MSmits: do it better&#160;:)
 sunksuperset370: i am colliding with the oppoenent and my pod get knocked off course 
 MSmits: there are 10 line bots that can get to gold. All that matters is making the turns efficiently
 Shadowtick: oof
 MSmits: other stuff becomes important in legend... maybe top gold
 Shadowtick: I still am stuck in wood 2 league
 MSmits: yeah, actually, playing coders strikes back heuristically isn't so much about being a good coder
 MSmits: more about finding the right heuristic to use for the turns
 MSmits: it's hit and miss
 MSmits: if you know you're a good coder already, you'll make more progress in other multis maybe
 MSmits: a crappy coder that just finds the right if else heuristic can beat you to gold quickly. I got to gold with a 200 line program that was way overkill for what it was meant to do
 Shadowtick: I know but I just don't know how to put in the if (nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90) or (nextCheckpointAngle &lt; -90)  without it messing up my pod's speed and not letting it move at all
 AntiSquid: been practicing all the good coding standards in CSB IDE, comments and code maintainability and readability and now MSmits says it's not what good coders do&#160;:( Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: is there a way to add a new opponent
 jacek: also CSB requires physics :c
 MSmits: good coders just find the right if else heuristic :P
 MSmits: yeah that could be a barrier
 MSmits: both if you know a lot of physics (overcomplicating things) or if you dont know any
 MSmits: hey jacek, if you use transpositions for your negamax bots, do you also make your own hash table?
 MSmits: or do you use some builtin like unordered set/map
 DomiKo: I have a problem with 2048&#160;:(
 DomiKo: When i submit my long string
 DomiKo: CG crash&#160;:((
 MSmits: thats not a problem, that means you won CG
 jacek: MSmits i use unordered_map
 DomiKo: but that's only 5K chars
 MSmits: ahh ok, i have found that it's really easy to make your own hashtable and it's many times faster
 MSmits: often when i put in an unordered map/set, I halved my overall performance
 MSmits: really big hit
 MSmits: i did this 1st in my D&amp;B local solver and it solved in half the time
 MSmits: compared to unordered set
 jacek: when new D&amp;B bot?
 MSmits: meh, i got the solver done, but its a lot of work getting it into a live both, will end up being 3k lines total&#160;:(
 MSmits: i will do it
 MSmits: but not soon
 MSmits: live bot
 MSmits: basically what it will do is solve at 50 plies or so
 MSmits: maybe 45 or so for easy endgames
 MSmits: no idea what kind of logic to use to place lines before this, but hopefully that wont matter 
 Shadowtick: it's hard for me because I don't use if-else statements much because I don't understand it that much
 MSmits: understand if else?
 MSmits: if (hungry) Eat();  
 MSmits: else Sleep();
 MSmits: my dog can do it
 Shadowtick: I know how it works I just don't understand how to use it that
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well you could have two output possibilities, one with power 0 and one with power 100
 MSmits: based on some if heuristic
 Shadowtick: ok
 MSmits: it's hard to give you any specific advice on coders strikes back, it's a weird game like that
 Shadowtick: but you haven't seen my code to see what it looks like right now
 MSmits: either you do heuristics and then I'd mostly be telling you physics stuff, or you simulate the entire game and use a search algorithm and then it's just a LOT of coding
 MSmits: maybe you can google some simple CSB examples?
 Shadowtick: I am just gonna send you my code so you can see what it looks like
 MSmits: other people have put their code online (Even though you're not supposed to)_
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: dont know what else to say about csb... dont want to give away the -3vel
 darkhorse64: give away Magus CSB article to get Legend instead of Gold
 MSmits: yeah but to use that properly, you need to be a pretty good coder already
 MSmits: at least know what you're doing
 darkhorse64: I learned AG with inoryy starter. Now, I know the implementation can be improved
 MSmits: ah, I never learned it
 jacek: AG?
 Astrobytes: algorithme génétique
 MSmits: That's GA in French
 MSmits: apparently :P
 jacek: w00t
 MSmits: so maybe if you do CSB in AG you can make top 10 :P
 Astrobytes: even the French for 'flea' sounds great
 darkhorse64: Even on the chat do I have a f***g French accent
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: yep
 jacek: eeyup
 Danotris: I understand the theory behind AG, but using it in practice is another story
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: I'm pretty sure I can write a SA
 MSmits: which you should learn before GA anyway
 MSmits: cuz it's way easoer
 Danotris: SA&#160;?
 MSmits: easier
 jacek: AS?
 MSmits: simulated annealing
 darkhorse64: recuit simulé in French
 jacek: annealing simmulaté?
 jacek: oh
 darkhorse64: means nothing
 MSmits: SA just has a single solution and you're replacing it randomly with other candidates. 
 Astrobytes: in Polish that's: wjckwcd cjkrwd
 jacek: i did GA, never did SA, and i was playing around with PSO
 MSmits: you should replace your keyboard Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: did you get anywhere with PSO jacek?
 darkhorse64: SA = MC with an improved selection&#160;?
 jacek: nah, PSO is just more localized GA
 Astrobytes: maybe better to be used in conjunction with something else
 darkhorse64: Never wrote an SA. I need some pseudo code to understand it
 darkhorse64: I use GA for search race but it does not work very well compared to the results I have with CvZ
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing</a>
 wlesavo: i had SA and GA for NS, and that GA never worked properly while SA gave quite an ok results
 wlesavo: since than i have SA in almost all the optims ive tried :slight_smile:
 jacek: i learn by examples. what i really hate is when they give you example with only.1 parameter. how do i choose 2 or more candidate parameters?
 jacek: im slow learner, even if i figured out 2 parameters, i would need examples with 3 parameters, 4 parameters... then maybe ill get the idea
 wlesavo: just add couple more mutations
 darkhorse64: Thanks Astrobytes. Pseudo-code, explanation and samples, all I need to climb the optim LB again
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: it's basically to avoid getting stuck in local optima, higher initial temperature means probability of accepting a suboptimal solution is higher, you jump around in the search space a bit more, as it 'cools' the probability of selecting a suboptimal solution decreases
 Astrobytes: (essentially)
 wlesavo: cooling rate is the most painful thing in SA, sometimes i just do an e-greedy
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I suspect I am stuck in a local minimum at SR
 wlesavo: also random number of mutations helps quite a bit
 Astrobytes: Yeah it can be tricky to fit
 Astrobytes: anyway, out for a bit. See you all later
 MSmits: bye Astrobytes
 MSmits: what is SR again?
 darkhorse64: bye
 darkhorse64: Searh Race
 darkhorse64: *Search*
 MSmits: ahh ok
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave :rage:
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl :heart_eyes:

 eulerscheZahl: share a replay zeno, i'm curious how hard it's lagging on load

 eulerscheZahl: it got approved yesterday evening
 MSmits: mystery solved
 dbdr: MSmits: did you see who is 1st on D&amp;B?
 MSmits: no

 jacek: HIM?
 jacek: *FOLLOW*
 MSmits: oh
 dbdr: "n 2006, Rémi Coulom described the application of the Monte Carlo method &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method</a>&gt; to game-tree search &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game-tree_search">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game-tree_search</a>&gt; and coined the term Monte Carlo tree search &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search</a>&gt;"
 eulerscheZahl: seems more likely than this Remi<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nqtv">https://www.youtube.com/user/nqtv</a>

 jacek: "The AlphaZero algorithm works for many board games, but not for Dots and Boxes"
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: "my entry should be easy to beat"i'll translate that: dbdr your bot sucks
 MSmits: if it doesnt solve at 50 plies in, then it should be easy to beat yes
 dbdr: yay, I'm on twitter :D
 MSmits: this game really requires an endgame solver
 MSmits: I played with @CodinGame
 MSmits: jacek, go clash
 MSmits: maybe you will find him there&#160;:)
 jacek: im 266th
 jacek: im better than remi
 MSmits: indeed
 dbdr: learned something about alphago from a screenshot, which is not disclosed in research papers :D
 MSmits: nice
 jacek: and hes only silver in Artificial Intelligence :thinking:
 jacek: what a noob
 darkhorse64: We should invite him to play Yavalath
 jacek: he has breakthrough bot
 MSmits: wait, what why yavalath
 MSmits: dont touch that leaderboard, it's been perfected
 darkhorse64: CG will be happy to know it has such an illustrious member
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's kinda cool. Good advertising on twitter also
 dbdr: he has a company, curious what his business model is
 MSmits: maybe his business model is, I am already rich, i code fun stuff
 dbdr: "We licence our AI systems to Unbalance &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.unbalance.co.jp/">http://www.unbalance.co.jp/</a>&gt;, a Japanese game publisher."found it
 MSmits: ah ok
 dbdr: he was assistant uni professor
 dbdr: not the way to get rich&#160;;)
 MSmits: true
 dbdr: MSmits: is Lille far from where you live?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: looks like tulips and daisies will be on contest
 dbdr: well, you might still be the closest. just need to go through belgium&#160;:)
 dbdr: I did not realize Lille was so close to the border
 dbdr: looks like the made a detour to keep Lille in France :D
 Shadowtick: is anyone here food with javascript and could possibly help me with my coders strike back code?
 dbdr: javascript is not part of a healthy diet&#160;;)
 dbdr: MSmits, what happened to your D&amp;B bot?
 Shadowtick: Well I'm more used to javascript since I always used p5.js
 MSmits: sec :phone:
 dbdr: was joking about the typo. what's your problem Shadowtick?
 Scarfield: you have a second phone? sus
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: yes, it sucks, just less than all the others except Remi's&#160;:)
 d_ramdom_guy: reyktfuljk
 MSmits: dbdr
 MSmits: my solver is done (locally)
 MSmits: 1 in a million endgames i cant solve in 100 ms
 MSmits: most of the rest i can solve in less than 1 ms
 MSmits: but putting the solver in a bot is a lot of work
 MSmits: endgames start at ply 55 or so, so all games should be solved from that point, or a few plies earlier, if i extend the negamax
 MSmits: also i live in a northern corner of my country, so not near Lille&#160;:)
 MSmits: so anyway, not sure when i will make it into a real D&amp;B bot. I am doing some negamax experiments for other games currently. Games where mcts type solutions seem worse
 dbdr: which games?
 MSmits: i want to try onitama, othello and checkers for sure
 MSmits: maybe breakthrough
 MSmits: I never could make a good negamax before because i couldnt get TT + ab right, but i fixed that
 MSmits: onitama should be nice because I put the full state in 64 bit
 jacek: w00t
 jacek: what about cards
 MSmits: also
 MSmits: takes 5 bit
 MSmits: 5 bit for cards, 25 bit per player for pieces, then I think 3 bit per wizard to say which of the pieces is the wizard
 MSmits: 3*2 + 25*2  + 5 = 61 bit
 dbdr: 3 bits wasted&#160;:(
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:(
 jacek: 5 bits for cards?
 MSmits: yeah there are only 30 ways to distribute 5 cards among 2 players
 MSmits: with 1 card in the center
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: thats math
 MSmits: yes :P
 jacek:&#160;:(
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5d2b298-f3e6-4bf3-ae39-798725f8fc17">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5d2b298-f3e6-4bf3-ae39-798725f8fc17</a>

 eulerscheZahl: wait...
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/6bdXwrcP">https://pastebin.com/6bdXwrcP</a>
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: 1st warning&#160;;)
 jacek: thats germany for ya
 AntiSquid: blame the frogs
 jacek: oh right, i was thinking how could you fit 5 16 different cards
 dbdr: frogs are french, toads are german
 MSmits: yeah i dont put that in the state
 MSmits: i connect the 0,1,2,3,4 to the card
 MSmits: so it's a separate array
 MSmits: some complicated precalc stuff takes care of this
 dbdr: oh, Zenoscave took over eulerscheZahl at 2048
 MSmits: basically i lookup a card with a position to find a moveboard, which has bits set for each reachable cell
 dbdr: scores in millions. we might discover how many bits CG uses :D
 AntiSquid: where do the serious bots start at&#160;? for 2048
 Illedan: &gt; 15 mill
 dbdr: lol
 jacek: getting to 2048 in single game is about 20k?
 MSmits: I think they keep going after that?
 jacek: of course
 MSmits: ah ok, havent tried the game myself
 jacek: not even by hand?
 MSmits: your bots are keeping me too busy in other games
 MSmits: i think once or twice
 eulerscheZahl: 2 1-star reviews already
 MSmits: why?
 dbdr: :O
 eulerscheZahl: what's the treshhold agaig for garbage collection?
 eulerscheZahl: again*
 dbdr: are multis ejected automatically like puzzles?
 MSmits: when the bag is full, you dump it
 eulerscheZahl: i think it applies for all community contributions
 MSmits: wait, when are they ejected?
 jacek: by remi?
 dbdr: those ratings look like US politics. 2 five stars, 2 one star
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Illedan: haha
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl you didn't make a twitter post did you?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not on twitter :P
 MSmits: ah ok good
 eulerscheZahl: we can share replays now without spoiling. there's a random testcase
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/491533999">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/491533999</a>not my best run but loading already gets laggy
 dbdr: A MULTI THE LIKES OF WHICH WE'VE NEVER SEEN!!!
 MSmits: people say it's the best
 dbdr: yeah, laggy
 MSmits: very
 jacek: so unoptimized
 eulerscheZahl: so many states to display
 Illedan: That is a brilliant thing euler. About the sharing random testcases :D 
 eulerscheZahl: also proves that you didn't hardcode
 dbdr: one frame lasts one minute :D
 eulerscheZahl: an evening-filling program to watch
 eulerscheZahl: if you watch it in normal speed, that replay will run for more than 3h btw
 Illedan: xD
 AntiSquid: how did you compress all that info in the replay?
 eulerscheZahl: wrote my own serializer
 eulerscheZahl: and visualization partially without the SDK
 eulerscheZahl: the replay from above without the static content that CG adds has about 10kB only
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i was looking at the wrong part
 eulerscheZahl: 72kB with output and error stream
 eulerscheZahl: good enough to allow more
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow the side shift with &lt;&gt; becomes unicode in the json, didn't consider that
 eulerscheZahl: now we have \u003c instead of &lt;
 eulerscheZahl: how inefficient&#160;:(
 jacek: struct would never allow that
 eulerscheZahl: struct would also reimplement the tile spawn instead of serializing that too
 Illedan: Not heard from struct?
 Shadowtick: ...
 AntiSquid: ...
 Scarfield: have you asked MadKnight, he might know if struct has been on discord?
 jacek: or AutomatonNN
 Q12: Can I bold letters in a comment to contribution? and if yes than how?
 Illedan: ctrl+b? never tried
 Illedan: Hm, didnt work. nvm
 Illedan: Seems to be plain text, unless you can add markdown syntax
 Illedan: Sorry for the notif euler, didn't work though :D
 Q12: Ok, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: there is no formatting in the puzzle comments
 Q12: Why not adding?
 eulerscheZahl: brings little value?
 Q12: understand
 eulerscheZahl: you have formatting in the contribution itself
 Q12: I know, thanks :relaxed:
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong Illedan?
 Illedan: Swapped x and y while looping for finding tile to spawn at
 eulerscheZahl: classic
 DomiKo: what is the easiest way to parse output strings in 2048?
 DomiKo: i reached limit so fast&#160;:(
 Illedan: Hardcoding?
 melchi: :eggplant:
 DomiKo: i have string of lenght 10K for each testcase&#160;:/
 Illedan: Part of the puzzle&#160;;)
 DomiKo: I guess I have to learn how to use something like base65K
 eulerscheZahl: you might have to split that 10k into multiple turns. i don't know if there is a limit for chars per turn
 eulerscheZahl: probably, CG has a limit for everything
 DomiKo: there is limit for CG crash
 Illedan: xD
 DomiKo: when I have to mamy moves in one turn
 DomiKo: chrome instantly BOOMMM
 DomiKo: but 100K chars limit
 DomiKo: is problem here&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i had that discussion with dbdr yesterday. my point of view: you won't be able to hardcode everything
 DomiKo: that's really got point for that puzzle
 Shadowtick: ...
 MSmits: hmm, doesn't 2048 have a lot of symmetry?
 MSmits: maybe the best moves are repeated
 MSmits: and you can take a current state, simplify it to the smallest version of that state and then look it up... not sure, havent tried it myself
 MSmits: then again, 16 cells and a lot of possible values of each cell...
 eulerscheZahl: i think the way to go if you want to hardcode: have some cheap heuristic for online solving. and hardcode the turns where it fails
 MSmits: makes sense
 AntiSquid: Shadowtick what's up with the "..." dots&#160;? O_O
 AntiSquid: O__O
 MSmits: actually eulerscheZahl, that's how all my opening books works
 Shadowtick: I'm just not gonna question anything that is going on here
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 MSmits: except you replace cheap heuristics with search
 eulerscheZahl: a search that will reliably find the best action
 MSmits: well most of the time yeah
 Shadowtick: AntiSquid its because I am confused about what I just stumbled into
 MSmits: or it goes deep enough that the search can take over and do good enough moves to win reliably
 AntiSquid: and if 100 users did that we'd just have ... every line .
 MSmits: Shadowtick you can always ask
 eulerscheZahl: ...
 MSmits: but the answers will cause more questions 
 eulerscheZahl: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 AntiSquid: or you could make your spam more varied and creative than just 3 dots
 AntiSquid:  /ban euler
 MSmits: he just did that :P
 MSmits: can't ban someone for doing what you asked :P
 Shadowtick: I know but I am just not gonna ask because I much rather fix the bug that is happening on my screen right now
 AntiSquid: learned it from reddit MSmits
 MSmits: aha
 AntiSquid: Shadowtick this ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤ bug?
 AntiSquid: lol kaggle silver ...
 Shadowtick: here I will make a whiteboard on whiteboard fox to show you 
 Illedan: ./clear
 AntiSquid: still have to figure what makes accurate predictions
 Saaalikh: hello
 Shadowtick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://r2.whiteboardfox.com/2189217-4189-3971">https://r2.whiteboardfox.com/2189217-4189-3971</a>here it is
 MSmits: I am not a bug!
 Shadowtick: no not you
 MSmits: you just marked my name in blue and said I am a bug :P
 AntiSquid: Shadowtick "There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling transmission. If we wish to make it louder, we will bring up the volume."
 Shadowtick: I am not on a tv
 Shadowtick: I am my chromebook
 AntiSquid: it's a twilight zone reference @_@
 Einwickler: Cheers guys
 jacek: hm
 jacek: everyone can see what i draw on that whiteboard?
 Shadowtick: yes
 jacek: oops
 Shadowtick: but you cant erase anyone else's drawings
 Shadowtick: jacek I can make one for us to draw
 jacek: nah
 dbdr: Illedan, how did you manage to do 50k?
 dbdr: my depth 0.5 did 97k&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: what score does random give?
 dbdr: I suspect 50k now&#160;:)
 Shadowtick: you can hit options and type it in text
 eulerscheZahl:  Console.WriteLine("UDRL"[random.Next(4)]);27k for that
 dbdr: sim is a bit annoying
 jacek: beautiful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/H3dRPJm.png">https://i.imgur.com/H3dRPJm.png</a>
 Astrobytes: Pure art.
 jacek: collective mind of CG
 AntiSquid: ULR is the 39.9k eulerscheZahl
 darkhorse64: ULR &gt; UDLR because you must keep the high values in a line 
 eulerscheZahl: Console.WriteLine("ULR"[random.Next(3)]);27k too
 dbdr: #define GOOD_RANDOM true
 AntiSquid: no random
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i got that
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just surprised that it works better than random
 jacek: print ULR over and over?
 eulerscheZahl: because the game will ignore invalid actions and end the turn right then and there
 eulerscheZahl: so you may have valid actions left but U isn't one of them
 eulerscheZahl: in that case you won't get any more points
 AntiSquid: ya but most of the time that sequence will work perfectly fine . see? domain specific knowledge, wasted enough time on that game to know this tiny bit of useless info
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: You have reached the maximum of submissions in a row. Please try again in a few minutes.
 jacek: :c
 eulerscheZahl: did you farm language awards?
 jacek: just spam submit random actions
 eulerscheZahl: the default code gives a point. except for clojure timing out
 AntiSquid: is there a bug with clojure in general or only on this puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's a general issue
 dbdr: imagine spam submitting and being last&#160;;)
 jacek: :c
 jacek: not anymore
 dbdr: race to the bottom :D
 dbdr: gg kovi
 jacek: but i cant get lower now eh
 kovi: optim game...
 eulerscheZahl: he has to defend the #3 on the global optim leaderboard
 dbdr: kovi: change min to max&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and might already hate the contribution :D
 kovi: #2
 eulerscheZahl: oh, congrats
 kovi: changes each day
 kovi: between me and marchete
 dbdr: everyday? :O
 dbdr: optim is less volatile than multi
 dbdr: are you optimizing?
 kovi: we are close
 darkhorse64: just like the global lb&#160;?
 kovi: no submissions from us last months
 dbdr: lol
 jacek: cant improve something optimal
 eulerscheZahl: onitama = puzzle of the week =&gt; more players =&gt; toad wins points (royale has no onitama bot)
 kovi: others submitting changes the minimal difference
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, was it expensive?
 darkhorse64: onitama +40 players and counting
 Ahmed_Salah7: fuck
 jacek: oO
 darkhorse64: +400 points for karliso
 darkhorse64: onitama: domiko trying to play a card that does not belong to him
 AntiSquid: thief
 darkhorse64: ban
 Zenoscave: pew pew pew
 darkhorse64: #91 on 108 not bad for a crashing bot
 kovi: nice score zenoscave on 2048
 Zenoscave: thanks kovi&#160;:)
 Illedan: Offline Zeno?
 Zenoscave: nope&#160;;)
 Illedan: Nice&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: How many moves per turn&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Beastly score!
 Zenoscave: I think that submit was 30?
 Illedan: And you lost at turn 600?
 Zenoscave: I usually fill up before 600
 darkhorse64: Nice search
 DomiKo: darkhorse64  that's default code
 Illedan: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave play the random test and share a replay
 Zenoscave: ok one sec.
 Illedan: 10 GB later..
 Zenoscave: maybe several seconds...
 darkhorse64: DomiKo: you can do better
 DomiKo: I guess I can
 DomiKo: but after 2048
 eulerscheZahl: copy-paste the boss from github
 kovi: 1x1sec + 600x50ms?
 eulerscheZahl: you got the numbers wrong kovi
 kovi: 599?
 eulerscheZahl: a single frame can have multiple actions of 500ms each
 eulerscheZahl: with a total replay length of several hours :D
 jacek: huh
 Zenoscave: 465 x 32 actions<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/491556450">https://www.codingame.com/replay/491556450</a>
 kovi: i meant time in search
 Zenoscave: oh yeah 465 x 50ms then
 eulerscheZahl: 2h 4min
 Zenoscave: hey that one made a 32768 cool
 eulerscheZahl: and the font gets smaller so it fits in&#160;:)
 kovi: knowing the random ahead is a big advantage to playing by hand
 Zenoscave: yeah I like that touch eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: giving the random is the only way to allow for that high amount of interactions
 kovi: i understand
 AntiSquid: what's with the random empty chat opening&#160;? something trying to fish for info on requests?
 Zenoscave: broke 15M
 kovi: nice
 Astrobytes: impressive sir!
 Astrobytes: Donno AntiSquid, seems related to external clients somehow, reported it last week
 Zenoscave: It was a pain getting the seed working. was casting to an int at one point
 Shadowtick: hi
 Zenoscave: damn magic auto-sizing
 Shadowtick: who here has heard of dead by daylight mobile before?
 AntiSquid: i don't see the appeal in that game
 AntiSquid: really dull
 Shadowtick: well I did the funniest thing in dead by daylight mobile
 Shadowtick: I put traps around all the generators then waited for some survivor to work on one and they got trapped
 Shadowtick: isnt it smart
 AntiSquid: i prefer an actual story
 AntiSquid: the gore shouldn't be the story and usually it's pointless anyway
 Shadowtick: well then let me get the whole lore to the whole game and its characters
 AntiSquid: no. dont.
 Shadowtick: would you rather read all that
 AntiSquid: no
 Shadowtick: I feel bad for the huntress though
 Shadowtick: she couldn't save her mother when she was just a child that's sad
 Shadowtick: I feel bad for her not being able to save her
 Shadowtick: anyways imma stop talking about dbd/dead by daylight
 AntiSquid: there are better horror stories out there
 Shadowtick: no not to many that I really
 Shadowtick: really like*
 MichaelKilbane: ayyy
 Shadowtick: I never knew the huntress in dead by daylight was russian
 Shadowtick: 🤯 my mind is blown
 auguluk: hello
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So a couple people just had to beat me on the leaderboard eh eulerscheZahl
 Shadowtick: check out what I made on ms paint
 Shadowtick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/jOKA3PO">https://imgur.com/jOKA3PO</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u killed imgur
 Shadowtick: I made that with a technique that I know how to use 
 Shadowtick: and Imma make some draw some to get better
 eulerscheZahl: but you got the 2048 tile PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My code is fairly barebones, a few more minor improvements maybe i cab get over 1M points,  but I'm almost maxed out with PHP
 eulerscheZahl: choose the right tool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at depth 6.  Maybe without the invalid move checker too, i dunno
 eulerscheZahl: you wouldnt climb the mount everest with running shoes either
 kovi: slowly running out of ideas on depth0
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's not about can I do it, it's about would I enjoy the climb?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kovi, heuristics aren't gonna do it , its a crunch and munch optim
 Astrobytes: If it were Everest: no. Base camp is bad enough in hiking boots.So just use C :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, you don't need OOP, just slows it down actually
 zegevlier: Helloooo
 Laminator: What uppppppp
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Illedan with a 5M score
 Astrobytes: nice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, here's a 4096  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/491583044">https://www.codingame.com/replay/491583044</a>
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so, what's your scoring PatrickMcGinnisII?
 eulerscheZahl: how do you choose the next action
 Astrobytes: Patrick, you gotta beat Zeno's 32768
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, can you add a NOUI mode :P to instantly view the end result?
 Illedan: WHAT 8mill score, but 2 testcases failed
 Illedan: lolol
 eulerscheZahl: technically: yes I can disable the viewer
 eulerscheZahl: but don't you want hours of high quality entertainment for free?
 Astrobytes: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: scoring...is the actual score.  I traverse everything unless it's an Invalid Move (which is if the board has changed)
 zegevlier: Just beating my friend at clash of code, not much
 zegevlier: lmaoo
 Zenoscave: PatrickMcGinnisII I only do depth 6
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I keep the best at every node, which is kinda slow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Zenoscave seriously?
 Zenoscave: yup
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just counting number of merges?
 Astrobytes: C++ master race PatrickMcGinnisII :P
 Zenoscave: monotone is your key
 PatrickMcGinnisII: must be a trick
 Zenoscave: Illedan are you coming for my spot?
 Illedan: Yeah.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well when u detrmine next drop spot you do have to count open squares
 Illedan: Gimme 10 min
 Zenoscave: How long do I have&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: Of course PatrickMcGinnisII
 Zenoscave: it is used in the RNG algo
 eulerscheZahl: i only score the board state
 eulerscheZahl: the number in the top left corner gives the highest score
 eulerscheZahl: the one below has the 2nd highest scoring factor and so on
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: I lost because I gave no action -.-
 Zenoscave: well fix it
 Zenoscave: ezpz
 Illedan: Wonder how that happen
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: true
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the biggest # being dumped into a corner would seem to be a higher probability of success
 Illedan: Ah LOL
 Illedan: bug
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: I do it online btw
 eulerscheZahl: updated. print a "-" in your move line and the viewer is off
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl does an invalid move being detected by referee dump the rest of the input moves behind it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes partick
 Illedan: ezpz ^^
 Shadowtick: I finished my drawing
 Shadowtick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/2TzcNp1.png">https://i.imgur.com/2TzcNp1.png</a>its the crying child from fnaf
 Zenoscave: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Zenoscave: MY LEAD
 Illedan: :P
 Astrobytes: Shadowtick: any chance you could just spout random rubbish somewhere else?
 eulerscheZahl: my 2nd place
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 5460 nodes at depth 6, does that sound right?
 Astrobytes: oof nice Illedan
 Zenoscave: let's get our places back eulerscheZahl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 16M, wtf
 Shadowtick: it's not rubbish&#160;;-;
 eulerscheZahl: make toad great again
 eulerscheZahl: 5460 nodes sounds like you need pruning
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just trying to gigure out why I can't get to depth 7
 eulerscheZahl: but i get your number too using a calculator
 eulerscheZahl: i only keep the best 50 at each depth
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I am recursive at the moment as well
 eulerscheZahl: but don't listen to me, the fish knows more
 dbdr: shouldn't it be 4^6 = 4096?
 eulerscheZahl: 4^6+4^5+4^4+...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: +4^5+4^4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol
 kovi: nice illedan
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan isn't talking
 Illedan: What do you want me to talk about?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Someone go plant a cam in Oslo&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: the number shifting app
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Illedan: I'm stuck waiting 1 min at every testcase just to get the frikkin viewer, where the whole webpage freezez
 Illedan: -.-
 eulerscheZahl: did you read my comment?
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl  08:04PMupdated. print a "-" in your move line and the viewer is off
 Illedan: OH
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: every round?
 eulerscheZahl: once is enough
 eulerscheZahl: you can also print -UULDR
 Shadowtick: imma just go and draw some more
 eulerscheZahl: it's also written in the statement if you reload the puzzle
 Illedan: Still slow :P
 Astrobytes: Still faster than dev time for the number shifting app :P
 Illedan: hahaha
 Illedan: Ok
 Illedan: Damn, getting a random timeout or something on submit -.-
 Shadowtick: oof
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/PnQrLbF">https://imgur.com/a/PnQrLbF</a>
 Illedan: .....
 eulerscheZahl: but a nice score
 Astrobytes: that score tho
 eulerscheZahl: "Still slow :P"he confessed to fake news
 Illedan: Yeah, now I accept it
 Illedan: thx&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Do i really have to use a different browser, this one has got to be hacked
 Illedan: My filecopy failed me :P
 eulerscheZahl: so non-presidential of you to just accept it
 kovi: gah, dbdr improved
 Illedan: lol
 dbdr: a rounding error for Illedan&#160;;)
 dbf: breaking news: raic is without t-shits this time&#160;:(
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: noooo
 Astrobytes: good. T-shirts would be so much better :P
 eulerscheZahl: hoodies?
 dbf: no hoodies
 Astrobytes: "without t-shits "
 Illedan: Time to win then..
 eulerscheZahl: in the past the tshirt+hoodie was my main point of motivation
 eulerscheZahl: as the games tend to be unnecessarily complex for my taste
 Astrobytes: but what about a t-shit?
 dbf: they mentioned that there will be some monetary prizes and stuff like promo-codes so you have a chance to get a discount in some food delivery service&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 Astrobytes: covid-conscious
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care about money. i want something that i can't buy in a shop
 Illedan: Agreed
 Astrobytes: I'll send you a small drawing of a toad if you want
 Astrobytes: Can sign it too
 dbf: yep, but I'm not sure what is an issue: problems with delivery or budget reduction
 eulerscheZahl: via paint and imgur?
 Astrobytes: No - real paper
 jacek: how about computer olympiad? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://icga.org/?page_id=3131">https://icga.org/?page_id=3131</a>
 Astrobytes: And framed too
 jacek: though im not sure how this works
 Astrobytes: using Ludii eh
 jacek: the one that invented yavalath&#160;:?
 dbf: so wash your raic t-shirts in carefull mode now
 Astrobytes: Yeah, must be a variant of it jacek 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: using the open square count as best at depth 6 scored lower for me
 jacek: use n-tuples [solved]
 eulerscheZahl: just score the number at each cell with a different factor
 eulerscheZahl: top left * large numbercell below * slightly smaller number
 eulerscheZahl: not perfect but give it a try
 dbdr: ignoring empty cells?
 eulerscheZahl: well, illedan has twice my score
 eulerscheZahl: and that icga doesn't even have UTTT. bad site
 eulerscheZahl: while CG modified the original rules of the game
 Astrobytes: Posted it in external contests
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm  eulerscheZahl, yea just tried that, it encourages board to get filled, lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how to compensate for empty cells
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: it does not encourage that
 eulerscheZahl: if you have a factor difference &gt; 2 between each cell
 eulerscheZahl: score = grid[0,0]; score *= 3;score += grid[1,0]; score *= 3;...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: $newsc=($tsc[0]&lt;&lt;16)+(($tsc[1]+$tsc[4]+$tsc[5])&lt;&lt;8)+(($tsc[2]+$tsc[6]+$tsc[8]+$tsc[9]+$tsc[10])&lt;&lt;4)+
 dbdr: lol, I had forgotten to call spawn() :D
 eulerscheZahl: not gonna read that mess
 Shadowtick: imagine a uno reverse card in a uno reverse card that is in a uno reverse card and that uno reverse card is in a uno reverse card
 eulerscheZahl: nice one dbdr :D
 dbdr: oh, and now I reach 600 turns so I waste points
 eulerscheZahl: ille just swapped x and y
 Illedan: I forgot spawn before that
 FuriousT: is there a way to play previous leagues again?
 eulerscheZahl: print a - to disable the viewer btw
 eulerscheZahl: only one way FuriousT: create a new account
 Illedan: -.-
 FuriousT: figured.  thanks for the info
 Illedan: Reached 600 steps and there was still moves to do&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: unless you are SaiksyApo. he can go up and down as he wants
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top left * 65536 +   next squares out*256  + next squares out*16...I'm doing it wrong
 eulerscheZahl: how many actions to you print per frame Illedan?
 Illedan: Dynamic
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 600!  ok, loading my gun
 eulerscheZahl: got there too when i was just printing 10 actions each time
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, can you print the score on each round in game information?
 Illedan: As I have no viewer, I can only see it if I win
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: not today anymore
 Illedan: Ok
 eulerscheZahl: not a valid spelling<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/2250/">https://xkcd.com/2250/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: are you normal or weird? how shall I tell?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: Just weird
 jacek: oK
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder testing in production?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/00d8d7ab-eed1-4e99-b548-54d579ba333b">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/00d8d7ab-eed1-4e99-b548-54d579ba333b</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: O.K.
 Astrobytes: and 6 registrants...
 eulerscheZahl: how about a minesweeper puzzle (not optim) as a next project?random testcase but only 1 or 2. so you may have to submit a few times. but not that much if your program is good
 jacek: i never understood minesweeper
 dbdr: PatrickMcGinnisII: I got 1M with depth 6
 Asta971: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)</a>
 dbdr: so you might have a bug
 Asta971: @jacek
 jacek: oO
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i got the basic of what eulerscheZahl was talking about, its neat to watch  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/491597234">https://www.codingame.com/replay/491597234</a>
 dbdr: 1M with score as eval
 dbdr: so theoretically that should lead to the same score, apart from ties in decisions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I notice I have alot of ties
 dbdr: what I wonder with euler's method is, how do you deal with the top left being empty after moving down?
 kovi: my greedy is also using topleft tendency
 dbdr: do you score the top left of non-empty squares? or just get 0 for it?
 Astrobytes: I guess since you know the next spawn point you can take that into account, unlike playing by hand
 MeMBuK: salın beni sq
 MeMBuK: sw
 MeMBuK: aq
 Astrobytes: MeMBuK: English in World chat please
 dbdr: kovi: maybe just because of ties and move order?
 kovi: yes, i programmed it that way
 kovi: basicly that is the way i solve
 kovi: manually
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dbdr at depth 6, the top left would never be 0 w/ his eval
 dbdr: what if you move it down or right?
 dbdr: or you just avoid that?
 kovi: me? i only do that as a last resort. or when there is a huge benefit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i stopped checking scores at lower depths, just passed them on
 Astrobytes: Oh, sorry, I misread. I would have thought scoring would remain the same for topleft, since that's where you aim to be keeping your highest tile
 kovi: of course i dont peek at random for now, just like with real game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I still don't have a solution that will beat my 900k
 Illedan: Damn GC is killing me
 Illedan: -.-
 Astrobytes: makes a change from CG I guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i kept the actual score, the eval only happens at last branch
 MeMBuK: salın beni amk
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the eval could be the tiebreaker i guess
 Astrobytes: MeMBuK: second time, English in World chat please
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: nice Illedan
 dbdr: hint: don't use GC&#160;;)
 Illedan: Yeah
 Astrobytes: oof yeah, well played
 Illedan: I have to optimize some part
 Illedan: LINQ might not be the best in my tight loop
 dbdr: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 dbdr: wait, there is a random seed in validators too?
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: Dammit
 Illedan: Who approved this thing
 Illedan: Shouldnt be
 Illedan: according to the contribution
 dbdr: the names is there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the eval as a tiebreaker worked well
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/lijqIS.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/lijqIS.jpg</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2.4% improvement
 dbdr: get that million!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: got another 21k, still at 984k, under a 1M
 Astrobytes: almost there&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan 19M?  seriously
 Illedan: Damn serious
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how long does it run on your machine to get to 1800 moves?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: *chuckle*
 Illedan: Didnt try
 PatrickMcGinnisII: To get higher depth I think I'm gonna have to use a SplHeap, and I think that's gonna slow it down too much
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, so at every decision, there are 0 to 8 merges
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can't ignore the moves with 0 merges
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i think you can ignore 2 moves with consecutive 0 merges
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that train of thought fails me thinks
 jacek: splheap?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php heap
 jacek: so its just heap, not so fancy version of it
 The_Auditor: breaking 100k requires actual thinking
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 100 lines of code for 900k
 The_Auditor: 3 if - 63k
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ULR over and over
 The_Auditor: not reading the board
 The_Auditor: a bit more complicated ULR gets stuck faster
 Illedan: 600 lines for 19 mill
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was just saying the overhead of almost 1M is pretty easy at 100 lines
 kovi: i also started with 3 ifs for 70k
 Illedan: Damn
 Illedan: I had 8 ifs for my initial 50k
 Illedan: -.-
 kovi: but getting 100k seems to be tough without "playing"
 kovi: i have slowed down especially now reaching max# submission
 Illedan: Spamming at 100k?
 kovi: nah, just slowly improving
 dbdr: spam detection seems very sensitive
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/38d2BH.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/38d2BH.jpg</a>
 dbdr: and I still cannot
 jacek: rust :pensive:
 dbdr: you need a trigger warning?&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Imma have to rewrite for non-recursive solution, depth 10 is attainable
 MSmits: with beamsearch, any depth is attainable 
 dbdr: depth 10 in PHP?  I doubt it
 MSmits: beamwidth = 1
 MSmits: doable
 Illedan: lol
 dbdr: I mean full search
 MSmits: eww
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can get depth 6 with most any of the complicated games...it's that next one that will never happen for me on CG.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when u joiinin' the leaderboard MSmits?
 MSmits: probably not this year
 Illedan: Wow
 Illedan: Where is your time at?
 MSmits: I've got many things on my list already
 MSmits: i mean for CG
 MSmits: but also study/work
 Illedan: And I just got confirmed we are getting a new Kitchen the week before the next contest :scream: hopefully able to focus some
 MSmits: CG I have negamax rewrites for some boardgames, D&amp;B bot, want to try some more stuff for uttt etc.
 MSmits: for study/work I need to write an AI course
 MSmits: it's basically my "thesis" 
 MSmits: have to write educational material and test it
 MSmits: i have this framework my colleague wrote for online learning that's quite good. Has a code runner and everything
 MSmits: I can design my own courses in that
 Illedan: :tada:
 MSmits: still difficult to do this for students without much programming skill
 MSmits: but I was thinking a lot of monkey see/monkey do
 MSmits: step by step BFS algo etc.
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits 100 lines of code...gets u in top 6
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol
 Illedan: Divide and conquer
 Illedan: 20 mill :dance:
 MSmits: what do you mean Illedan?
 MSmits: divide and conquer?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: his leaderboard in 2048
 MSmits: ah ok good job Illedan
 MSmits: seems a good game for you
 Illedan: Divide and conquer for learning students
 Illedan: Divide the problem, look at smaller parts
 Illedan: understand it
 MSmits: ah yes
 jacek: the solving by hand and hardcoding is getting out of hand
 MSmits: this is normal right: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34a2b777-8aab-445a-b0d3-44c1d058084d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34a2b777-8aab-445a-b0d3-44c1d058084d</a>
 Zenoscave: wonder if branch and bound would work here :thinking:
 MSmits: for negamax
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he said he not hardcoding, but i don't believe it
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f0db103c-d12a-41e8-a87d-6a78d59e71f3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f0db103c-d12a-41e8-a87d-6a78d59e71f3</a>
 MSmits: ah crap not working
 MSmits: Search Depth: 1 Score: 8420Search Depth: 2 Score: -2380Search Depth: 3 Score: 7620Search Depth: 4 Score: -1780
 jacek: invalid paste id? yeah its completely normal phenomenom for negamax
 MSmits: the pos/neg switching
 Illedan: 65536 got&#160;:)
 MSmits: with different depths
 MSmits: horizon effect
 Zenoscave: my bitboard only works up to 32768&#160;:/
 kovi: optimal solution? nice
 jacek: depends on eval. does it balance for tempo?
 MSmits: it does, but it's my eval from mcts version
 MSmits: so badly fitted
 jacek: some fluctuations can occur
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no uint zeno?
 MSmits: i call it a "turn bonus" 
 MSmits: apparently thats tempo
 MSmits: something i discovered when doing oware, the guy that just made a move gets a bonus
 jacek: well if you compare evens and odds only, they do not differ much
 MSmits: yeah
 Zenoscave: I bit pack
 Zenoscave: PatrickMcGinnisII
 jacek: for NN, i have de facto "2 NNs" depending whos turn now
 Zenoscave: each tile is a nybble
 MSmits: both players have a different NN?
 Zenoscave: smistiNN
 MSmits: hah, I never made one
 MSmits: i think I can explain to students how it works though
 jacek: its NN for the one player, but depending whos turn is now, different inputs to fire
 jacek: instead of making additional input for currentPlayer
 MSmits: ah ok
 Zenoscave: I never added alpha-beta or pruning to 2048 /flip
 Zenoscave: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a word for every square, not sure how that packs
 dbdr: alpha-beta Zenoscave? it's not a 2 player...
 MSmits: he's his own worst enemy
 Zenoscave: lol i need sleep
 Zenoscave: but i should prune
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh each board position is just a power of 2
 MSmits: thats why euler said beamsearch
 dbdr: alpha-alpha
 Zenoscave: lol
 MSmits: it's a simple form of pruning
 jacek: maximax?
 dbdr: yeah
 jacek: well, the game is your enemy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so 4 bits a square x 16 = 64 bits
 dbdr: only with random events
 Zenoscave: hmmmm might need to look into pruning. does just using UDR work?
 Shadowtick: imma say my name in Korean just for fun
 MSmits: go for it
 MSmits: just don't do it more than once
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is 64 bits an unsigned long or an unsigned long long?
 Zenoscave: ull
 PatrickMcGinnisII: been too long, tx
 HD-162826: :stuck_out_tongue:
 MSmits: is that compiler specific?
 Zenoscave: machine
 Zenoscave: not compiler
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: so weird
 jacek: if you do bit things, it doesnt matter. only for printing
 Hjax: do people do minimax for 2048? not mcts?
 MSmits: minimax makes no sense
 Zenoscave: Beam search it turns out
 MSmits: single player mcts can be done, but i guess beamsearch is better
 Hjax: replace minimax with *iterative search 
 Zenoscave: lol yeah 
 Hjax: do you explore the whole tree
 Zenoscave: expectimax has good results i read
 Zenoscave: I did in my last solution
 Shadow_freddy: my name in korean is spelled like this
 Hjax: because i feel like mcts would work quite well 
 MSmits: Hjax I don't think that would ever work for a game like this unless it is solvable
 Shadow_freddy: 그림자 프레디
 jacek: once again, tuples <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf">http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf</a>
 MSmits: full search i mean
 Zenoscave: Hjax we're  given the rng and seed
 Zenoscave: MSmits ^ 
 Shadow_freddy: well actually it isnt because there is no language that spells shadowtick in their own letters
 MSmits: sure, but that's not the same as having unlimited time Zenoscave
 Hjax: i feel like you could do some like, successive low depth full searches, pick the one that maximizes your heuristic, and launch a new search from the new node
 Zenoscave: good idea
 jacek: so... beam search?
 Zenoscave: try it! let us know!
 Hjax: like run a depth 5 search, pick your favorite outcome, launch a new depth 5 search from the new parent 
 Hjax: that isnt really beam search is it? 
 Zenoscave: sounds like chokudai
 MSmits: jacek maybe that beamsearch that expands its width, given more time
 MSmits: i forget the name
 jacek: as i understand, beam search is search with limited options (width)
 Hjax: so what im describing isnt that i think 
 MSmits: it's basically, search the next level, keep x best states
 MSmits: sometimes you can keep all states for a very long time
 MSmits: in hypersonic, i get beyond depth 20 easily, keeping all states
 jacek: or use jacekmax and get ∞
 Hjax: how many turns is 20 million score? 
 Hjax: or 1 million for that matter 
 Shadowtick: ята ятадеза ора ора ора ора ора ора ора ора
 MSmits: Hjax euler shared a replay earlier that took 3 hrs to play out
 Hjax: three HOURS
 MSmits: yes
 Hjax: :joy:
 MSmits: wasnt even his best score
 Hjax: thats incredible 
 Shadowtick: wow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he said he keeps top 50
 Shadowtick: I wanna see that
 MSmits: yeah he did some work compressing the replay, 1 replay frame is many turns
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think keeping top 16 is more realistic
 Shadowtick: oof
 MSmits: top 50 what PatrickMcGinnisII?
 Shadowtick: the ultimate uno reverse card
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top 50 board states, dunno the depth
 dbdr: Hjax: if you pick a best node and search from there, what are you going to learn?
 Shadowtick: here is the ultimate uno reverse card<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/AX15ODx.png">https://i.imgur.com/AX15ODx.png</a>
 dbdr: your first move is fixed at that point
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII it's really not that bad, if you get top 50, you only make 200 new states for each depth right?
 MSmits: make 200 new states, keep 50, make 200 new ones, keep 50 etc.
 Shadowtick: I did some photoshopping with ms paint
 MSmits: you can probably keep far more than 50
 MSmits: thousands even, if you do it offline
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not in php, too consuming
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shhhh, hardcoders are listening
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, gtg
 MSmits: bye 
 Shadowtick: ok byeeeeee
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 Shadowtick: I am at rank 647 in wood league 2
 Shadowtick: but I can't put in the if nextCheckpointAngle because it makes my pod stop moving
 Shadowtick: how would I fix it?
 AntiSquid: read your code more carefully
 Shadowtick: ok?
 AntiSquid: JUST DO IT!
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 Shadowtick: I said ok? since I am probably not gonna notice it
 AntiSquid: tough
 AntiSquid: then live with the consequences
 dbdr: AntiSquid you deserted D?
 AntiSquid: was just fooling around wanted to check something random and then it work unexpectedly 
 Shadowtick: welp Imma remove the if nextCheckpointAngle part then
 Shadowtick: so then I dont have to deal with it not moving
 Illedan: score: 960660On one testcase :D
 DomiKo: I reached 700K
 DomiKo: 900K must be nice
 DomiKo: congrats
 Illedan: 700k should give you scores around mine I guess
 Illedan: You solving it offline?
 DomiKo: yap
 Illedan: aha
 DomiKo: 10mln is coming
 Illedan: NIce
 Illedan: At 900k points I need 22k moves :O
 MadKnight: AntiSquid he put 'or' outside of ()
 MadKnight: like this:if (a) or (b)
 DomiKo: yap
 DomiKo: 11MLN
 DomiKo: here
 Illedan: No more problems with submission size?Is there 1 random testcase too?
 DomiKo: i have bad scores like 150K sometimes
 Illedan: Same
 DomiKo: yea random one 
 Illedan: Same code that gave me 900k, gave me 160k now -.-
 DomiKo: for me is like 2K points
 DomiKo:&#160;:(((
 Illedan: Oh, so you have to include a solver :P
 DomiKo: I didn't have time to make it work only for 50ms
 Illedan: I'm off, bye
 DomiKo: bye
 Laminator: Always nice when I forget it's shortest mode
 AnyaA: hi
 MadKnight: hihi
 MadKnight: say hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i haven't played it yet
 The_Auditor: AutomatonNN be nice, introduce yourself
 The_Auditor:&#160;:( he was a nice fella
 Zenoscave: does anyone know where the chokudai search code is?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no idea
 Laminator: Is that some weird ongoing joke?
 Zenoscave: no it's a beam search variation that I can't find the source for
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm putting in beam search right now, my depth 6 score of 984k isn't gonna cut it for very long
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think my stuff can handle a depth 5 search 3 times for a total of 15 moves per turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: instead of depth 6, once
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i didn't try it, too late...working on beam
 PatrickMcGinnisII: zeno, found a tuple one on giuthub
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/imos/icfpc2018/blob/master/chokudai/Program.cs">https://github.com/imos/icfpc2018/blob/master/chokudai/Program.cs</a>
 Zenoscave: YES
 MadKnight: AutomatonNN
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 kicked him
 Automaton2000: don't you need to add a few more

 5DN1L: why 20?
 r_lee27: (0 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 100)
 r_lee27: it is first mission
 5DN1L: but why y-coordinate + 20 + y-coordinate + 50?
 r_lee27: i dont know
 5DN1L: that's what you wrote
 Uljahn: just print something and hope it works :smirk:

 Ose: I can't do puzzle I'm  newbie
 Ose: This is why I'm so bad
 Ose: I can't do nothing
 5DN1L: It may not be that you're bad.
 5DN1L: It's like you aren't tall enough to reach a shelf.
 5DN1L: No matter how high you jump, you just can't reach there.
 5DN1L: In that case, you have to think of an alternative way to reach there.
 5DN1L: Or wait until you grow taller.
 Ose: Ok.
 Ose: It will take a long time though
 Ose: so you mean I have to be offline until I grow up
 5DN1L: I didn't mean that.
 5DN1L: In the meantime, learn other things first
 5DN1L: I know there are some resources for small kids to learn programming. I'm not familiar enough to recommend any though.
 Ose: why?
 derjack: because hes not a small kid ~
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Smart kids write programs, dumb kids eat play-doh
 Ose: What?
 TheDice: lol
 Ose: What should I do?
 TheDice: You can try to learn coding at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">https://www.w3schools.com/</a>It helped me to get started
 barmiextreme: or you could learn java with the bluej book. helped me in school.

 Automaton2000: "i am rank hashtag-five" lol
 eulerscheZahl: in #clash i see some inactive users. anyone willing to join there?

 Astrobytes: sorry jacek, was a test
 jacek: youre mod here too
 eulerscheZahl: we are still part-time mods
 jacek: for part-time salary
 eulerscheZahl: can't kick you here
 Astrobytes: same
 eulerscheZahl: shows as mod here once you saw us on another channel where we are mods. but we are toothless on #world
 eulerscheZahl: so i wasn't crazy last time, i just joined some other channel
 Astrobytes: that does indeed explain it
 eulerscheZahl: kind of - i still don't get the "how"
 jacek: you wanted to clash so you joined #clash
 Astrobytes: True. Do we really care?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: no one wants to moderate #clash anyways
 Astrobytes: It's almost insulting
 jacek: thats why youre mod there :v
 eulerscheZahl: i'll bribe struct into kicking you here for this
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: jacek message me your NN framework to avoid the kick

 droidek314: Hey, can somebody help me with C#?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is finally recovering from New Years Eve</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: we have some c# knowledge, just ask
 Astrobytes: clearly took Patrick a while to C# again
 droidek314: There is a problem with rounding the numberIt doesn't want to round it to the bigger side, I guess
 Scarfield: Punstrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: it does bankers rounding
 eulerscheZahl: towards even
 eulerscheZahl: round(0.5)=0round(1.5)=2
 BlaiseEbuth: Like a record baby. Right round. Round, round&#160;!
 droidek314: In the last test it says that it needs -175, but my program gives it -174
 Astrobytes: hey FireScald
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I Pounded too much whiskey, still not C#
 eulerscheZahl: and what's the input for that -174 thing?
 droidek314: -10000 - 10000, or smthng like that
 Astrobytes: lol, I took my time on my Scotch, still got half a bottle of Glenmorangie left
 droidek314: There is no clear input message
 Scarfield: i would advice drinking it, tastes much better
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 droidek314: Anyway it finished, but I don't understand why it didn't make it right
 BlaiseEbuth: Balmer peak ftw
 Astrobytes: indeed

 eulerscheZahl: this task?
 droidek314: yup
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact, that's another ms thing I can say good thing about. :yum:
 Scarfield: lol didnt know balmer peak. think i saw a video of someone making a game with some bit manipulation, that he wrote drunk, and had no idea how it worked afterwards
 Astrobytes: I have been known to do similar things on CG
 BlaiseEbuth: It's all about the balance.
 eulerscheZahl:  The arithmetic mean of all numbers, an integer rounded down.
 eulerscheZahl: "rounded down"
 eulerscheZahl: int count = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());List&lt;int&gt; nums = Enumerable.Range(0,count).Select(i=&gt;int.Parse(Console.ReadLine())).ToList();       Console.WriteLine(Math.Floor(nums.Average()));
 eulerscheZahl: these 3 lines make all tests go green
 droidek314: weirdI went through all tests, bu that didn't pass though
 eulerscheZahl: did you use anything to round down like(int)or Math.Floor()
 BlaiseEbuth: Ancient Persian used to debate any idea sober then drunk, and to validate it only if it seemed to be good both time.
 Astrobytes: nice, sound methodology right there
 droidek314: I used only toInt32
 BlaiseEbuth: :beer:
 eulerscheZahl: that's for parsing the input and converting string to int, isn't it?
 droidek314: not quiteI used for loop to count the numbers and then in another variable divide them by count
 droidek314: and another variant was just this ToInt32(result)
 droidek314: variable*
 eulerscheZahl: hm, did you use floats for division or always integers?
 eulerscheZahl: because -10/3 = -3floor(-10/3.0) = floor(-3.33) = -4
 droidek314: hmmm, interestingI think it was int/int
 eulerscheZahl: :beers: on the other chat

 BIBI38: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, 1 puzzle done today
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: Shame lol, good read though&#160;:+1:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, i thought it was the liquor from new years, but apparently it's Omicron
 Chito[patito: h
 Fasty_V-12_Engine: Can someone be my friend, I am lonely
 PatrickMcGinnisII: programming keeps us warm and fuzzy
 ninjadip: reminds me of fuzzy logic
 ninjadip: what angle do you guys recommend is the max for complete thrust cutoff in madpod 
 ninjadip: the max angle*
 Butanium: I think I used 20
 ninjadip: OK
 ninjadip: Because the max turn is 18?
 ninjadip: did you do like a gradual balance of the thrust cutoff? or just abrupt
 Butanium: if(angle &gt; 85) thrust = 0;elsethrust = 100
 Butanium: was mostly that acutally
 ninjadip: that's not what i meant
 Butanium: I used a sigmoid function which was exactly this
 ninjadip: yeah i used to have that
 Butanium: what league are you&#160;?
 ninjadip: gold
 ninjadip: what's the sig function
 Butanium: do you have access to speed&#160;?
 ninjadip: right now i'm doing some atan() to calc the angles
 Butanium: it was something which was actually a camoufled stair function lol
 ninjadip: yes, and its easy to calculate even if they don't give it to you
 Butanium:         # angle: angle of your pod
 ninjadip: it's not a relative angle
 ninjadip: it's an absolute angle in gold league
 ninjadip: i had to calculate my relative angle to whatever my target is, and then compare to my absolute angle
 Butanium: oh right I have a function too I think
 ninjadip: yes
 ninjadip: right now my angle max is 100
 ninjadip: kind of liked it better than 100, for smoother drifting
 ninjadip: 90*
 Astrobytes: ninjadip:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 ninjadip: i think i just solved my own problem. i need to have this angle max fluctuate....
 ninjadip: wtf is that link for
 Astrobytes: mad pod racing
 Astrobytes: (it used to be CSB 'Coders Strike Back')
 Butanium: Also the angle between your current speed and the next check point can be a better approximation to know if you're going on the good way
 ninjadip: i'm already in gold
 Butanium: but the best thing is to simulate
 Astrobytes: This is from gold to legend material
 ninjadip: ok
 Butanium: and the link sent by astrobytes can be usefull
 ninjadip: i already have all that groundwork laid out
 Butanium: because it tells you how to simulate
 ninjadip: yes it would have been a couple days ago
 ninjadip: when i rewrote the whole thing from silver to gold
 Astrobytes: You don't necessarily have to use a rolling-horizon genetic algorithm 
 Astrobytes: (as in the doc)
 Butanium: do you already have a simulation process&#160;?
 jacek: trolling-horizon?
 Astrobytes: FFS jacek
 Astrobytes: lol
 ninjadip: a simulation process?
 ninjadip: i already have it running
 ninjadip: i glanced at the doc, i like discovering this myself
 ninjadip: not trying to just beat it, trying to learn
 Astrobytes: What was your plan?
 ninjadip: i already have most of that. not calculating drag right now, that's abt it
 Astrobytes: Search-based or just purely calculations?
 ninjadip: oh right now, i'm trying to discern the flight patterns from the cpu compared to mine, seems the angle cutoff is different at the approach of a checkpoint
 ninjadip: soon i will be enemy searching, that's my next thing
 ninjadip: but wanted to get the flight pattern as realiable as possible
 Astrobytes: good luck and enjoy&#160;:) It's a relatively fun game
 Vlad100: Who can tell you how much time is given for 1 move in ultimate tic-tac-toe
 jacek: 100ms
 Vlad100: thx
 Wontonimo: the first move is 1000ms though
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: these crazy metric units.  what is that in american units?
 Wontonimo: 1.7 light inches
 Wontonimo: per gallon
 Wontonimo: hey Vlad100 , congrats on joining UTTT and making a python bot
 Wontonimo: what kind of algo are you using Vlad100&#160;?
 Wontonimo: nabaztag, you are also kicking bot in UTTT, looks like you are about to be promoted to gold
 nabaztag: not sure :p
 jacek: mcts?
 nabaztag: it's done&#160;!
 nabaztag: yes, i try my first mcts 
 jacek: :tada:
 Astrobytes: well done nabaztag&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: 2d tile-based map gen. using wave function collapse<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/t1O0_yHe-6Y">https://youtu.be/t1O0_yHe-6Y</a>
 Blabbage: Astro: WFC looks awesome, when I get the time I am going to have a go at it, too much work right now
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 nabaztag: thx&#160;;)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it is awesome.  biggest revolution in ascii art since fixed-width fonts
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: it's not just for ascii roguelikes 
 Wontonimo: thaks Astrobytes for the link
 Wontonimo: cheers Blabbage&#160;!
 Astrobytes: was investigating some procedural generation stuff earlier and came across it
 Wontonimo: it starts to fall apart when there are lots of different colours/tiles and/or the kernel is too large.
 Wontonimo: it's really only good for smaller recurring patterns and does't tie the whole together.
 Astrobytes: Of course, it's just one part, you'd definitely use this in combination with a bunch of other generative algos
 Astrobytes: (same for any of them tbh)
 Wontonimo: I haven't found a use for it yet
 Astrobytes: the roguelike map-gen stuff is a nice start
 Wontonimo: but then again, I don't make games.
 Blabbage: There are some youtube vids of game devs using WCF almost as a black box algo, however the videos are not very technical
 Wontonimo: the links I put in the challenge were what I used as a template.
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: doesn't matter, lots to be learned just from doing as an exercise
 Wontonimo: I realized after making the puzzle that there are so many variants of implementations that it really comes down to how you want to enforce the constraint collapse
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes ABSOLUTELY&#160;!  I had a ton of fun diving back into constraint propagation&#160;!  Loved it
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: because with the shannon entropy (which is removed from the puzzle) it is only constraint prop
 Wontonimo: *without
 Astrobytes: You might be onto a series here
 Wontonimo: river crossing, markov text generation, WFC ... all constraint centric puzzles
 Astrobytes: I just saw them&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: can you list all contributions by one individual?
 Wontonimo: I've looked but couldn't figure out how
 Astrobytes: not unless you do it using the API I believe
 Astrobytes: ie. custom tool
 Wontonimo: hey nabaztag , how's the mcts going?  Looks like you are mid gold now
 Wontonimo: how many simulations per frame are you getting?  somewhere in  3,000 to 5,000&#160;?
 nabaztag: Not really at the moment, I need to improve my code
 Wontonimo: the gold boss is about 20,000 simulations per frame.  so that's a target if you are looking for legend
 Wontonimo: are you using bitboarding?
 .4ndr3w: are there any actual completely newbie stuff i can do
 nabaztag: 20k :o
 nabaztag: what it's bitboard  ?
 Wontonimo: a bitboard storing information in the bits instead of in the bytes
 Wontonimo: so, forexample
 Wontonimo: int a[] = {1,0,1,1};
 Wontonimo: is storing the values 1,0,1,1 in probably 16 bytes, 4 for each int.
 Wontonimo: where asint a = 0b1011;
 Wontonimo: stores all those values in 1 int as binary, using only 4 bytes.
 Wontonimo: you could store all the move of both players in just 2 ints, like so// top left and bottom rightint a = 0b100000001;  
 Wontonimo: and// centerint b = 0b000010000;
 Wontonimo: this has huge benefits.  HUGE
 Wontonimo: no, scratch that
 Wontonimo:&#160;!! H * U * G * E&#160;!!
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes: enormous in fact
 nabaztag: really&#160;? :o
 ZarthaxX: are we still talking about bitboards here?
 JuJuondatbeat: yeah
 JuJuondatbeat: we are
 Astrobytes: if you're familiar with bitwise operations it should be easy to get started nabaztag
 Wontonimo: yeah, here is an example of 3x3 tic tac toe that uses bitboards and MC.  Although it is C++ you can use the same ideas in JAva
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a>
 JuJuondatbeat: nabaztag is light work
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 struct: who even need bitboards when you can just use a NN
 Wontonimo: it is able to generate 200,000 simulations in 100ms
 ZarthaxX: howdy guys
 JuJuondatbeat: no nut?
 ZarthaxX: Astronautus
 struct: hi
 JuJuondatbeat: hi
 ZarthaxX: sup
 Astrobytes: different year, same ol' crap :D
 Wontonimo: wow, does one have to just mention bitboards to summon all the cool kids back to the playground&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 ZarthaxX: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: that keyword smells from far away 
 Wontonimo: honestly nabaztag, I don't know how you made it to Gold without bitboard&#160;!  I tip my hat to you for the accomplishment
 Astrobytes: I think it can be done without bitboard with a flat MC too, ask aCat, I don't remember if he used bitboards or not
 Astrobytes: one day I'll get around to playing it, I find it boring
 struct: had more fun with c4 than with uttt
 struct: but I didnt spend much time on either
 Astrobytes: Thx for the reminder, still need to fix my C4. BT was better
 Wontonimo: I still need to do oware-abapa, the NN tutorial as it has become known
 Astrobytes: It wasn't overly popular until then hehe
 Wontonimo: should rename it hehe
 Astrobytes: :D
 nabaztag: Really interesting the link to bitboard tictactoe :o
 Wontonimo: thanks, I wrote it.  it doesn't use MCTS, only MC, so don't copy that part.
 Astrobytes: nabaztag: you're already familiar with bitwise operations right?
 Astrobytes: (very familiar I mean)
 nabaztag: it's a simple mcts based on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/57060/mcts-tic-tac-toe-playground">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/57060/mcts-tic-tac-toe-playground</a>
 nabaztag: no, i read and learn now :p
 Astrobytes: ah that's a great tutorial for the basics, very good in fact
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo's is great for the bitboarding
 Astrobytes: nabaztag: It's in C++, ignore the NES emulator part, but this is a nice intro to bitwise operations<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/F8kx56OZQhg">https://youtu.be/F8kx56OZQhg</a>
 Wontonimo: here is a javascript bitboard (not mine) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/48392/bitboard-for-the-3x3-tic-tac-toe-game">https://tech.io/playgrounds/48392/bitboard-for-the-3x3-tic-tac-toe-game</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, are you willing to help me with some ideas for my uni assignment. I am struggling with the design ideas for a OOP project.
 Wontonimo: make a flight simulator
 Wontonimo: or a remake of Dwarf Fortress
 Manchi_o6o7: I have an assigment, but the implementation design is the problem
 Jonathan_is_trying: does codin teach C++? 
 Astrobytes: avoid deadly diamonds, don't subclass everything, try to use OOP as little as possible :P
 Wontonimo: codingame doesn't "teach" anything.  it provides problems and multis
 nabaztag: thx&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: hey Manchi_o6o7 , seriously what is the "problem" that you are going to use OOP to solve?  or is that what you are looking for?
 Manchi_o6o7: The problem is as following. I tried to solve it for the last three days, but right now I am at the stage where I want to start all over.
 Wontonimo: solve what?
 Manchi_o6o7: I need to make an e-learning system
 Manchi_o6o7: Students and tutors
 Manchi_o6o7: students can enroll to courses and chat with tutors
 Manchi_o6o7: and they can also send each other friend requests
 Astrobytes: client-server
 Manchi_o6o7: all with txt files
 Manchi_o6o7: ....
 ZarthaxX: txt files D:
 Wontonimo:&#160;?? 
 ZarthaxX: F
 Manchi_o6o7: yip
 Astrobytes: gotcha, just an exercise
 Manchi_o6o7: yes
 Astrobytes: fairly grim exercise but hey, you get what you get
 Manchi_o6o7: Usually, all the data would be stored in some database
 Manchi_o6o7: my idea was to do the following
 Wontonimo: it's had to give advice because I don't know what crazy ideas your prof has.  Do they like inheritance or are they into object composition?
 Wontonimo: I have opinions, but to get a good grade you've got to know what their opinion is
 Astrobytes: Seems more inheritance vibes, just a hunch
 Blabbage: lol
 Manchi_o6o7: yip
 Wontonimo: barf
 Manchi_o6o7: I have the class User
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Manchi_o6o7: and derived classes admin, student, and tutor
 Manchi_o6o7: but the think is
 Wontonimo: sorry, I can't help.  I'm morally against spreading evil
 Manchi_o6o7: hahahahahaha

 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Manchi_o6o7: can someone just give me an idea is it good to hold all the data in some containers
 Manchi_o6o7: after starting the program
 Manchi_o6o7: and then in the finish
 ZarthaxX:  nabaztag binary lowest bit is the rightmost
 Manchi_o6o7: just updating the files
 ZarthaxX: it's easier to think that the rightmost bit represents the top left cell
 ZarthaxX: you can do your version too anyway, it's ok
 ZarthaxX: the classic way is the first one
 Blabbage: Manchi: Look at software design patterns, maybe repository pattern
 nabaztag: ok i see
 Blabbage: Gotta go now, have fun...
 Astrobytes: later Blabbage
 Wontonimo: it's great to see so many familiar --faces-- err.. i mean icons back in the chat!  I've gotta go also
 Wontonimo: hope to see all of you soon
 Astrobytes: likewise! see ya later Wontonimo&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: cya wontooo

 Tien2k9: is "We're going in circles!" puzzle easy?
 BadB0y: :wave:
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: it is medium tien
 Tien2k9: but seem like it is easy
 PATTRIM: i dint see it b4
 SinsIsHereLadies: hey guys
 SinsIsHereLadies: I have a question if someone's present here
 SinsIsHereLadies:&#160;?
 SinsIsHereLadies: is there anyone here?
 Wontonimo: hi
 Wontonimo: just say your question SinsIsHereLadies
 SinsIsHereLadies: hey
 SinsIsHereLadies: have you ever tried the shadows of the knight?
 Wontonimo: yes.  that's it?  easy question.
 SinsIsHereLadies: can't solve it
 SinsIsHereLadies: tried many ways. I'm actually a c++ programmer but just 4 cases worked . Now I try it with Python and the sixth gives me error
 Wontonimo: well, it is a "medium" difficulty puzzle, and here on codingame that means it is pretty darn hard
 SinsIsHereLadies: actually, my programming level is not that bad but the way they explain what they want is a bit unfamiliar
 Wontonimo: did you try it in c++&#160;?
 SinsIsHereLadies: Yeah
 Wontonimo: and it worked?
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry
 SinsIsHereLadies: just the first four of them
 Wontonimo: okay, why do you think the others didn't work?
 SinsIsHereLadies: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9225bc4b-094a-44d1-8db4-28d0b7b82193">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9225bc4b-094a-44d1-8db4-28d0b7b82193</a>
 SinsIsHereLadies: :D if you have that patience
 SinsIsHereLadies: I'm sorry but it's like 20 minutes passed and I still get error with this and and it lowers my self-confidence
 Wontonimo: 20 min?  have patience
 Wontonimo: this isn't a clash of code
 SinsIsHereLadies: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: i budget 2 hours for "easy" puzzles, double for medium
 Wontonimo: and a day or two for hard
 Wontonimo: 20 min is enough time to just kinda get familiar with a puzzle
 e_fishel: why does shortest mode exist
 e_fishel: in coc
 e_fishel: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 e_fishel: the python dudes keep on winning
 SinsIsHereLadies: Well, but this one was not supposed to be this hard
 Wontonimo: hint, python does "bankers" rounding which may throw a wrench in your normal c++ approach
 SinsIsHereLadies: :grimacing:
 Wontonimo: hint 2&#160;: you can change python rounding to 'regular' using this handy shortcut
 Wontonimo: round( myNum + 0.0001 )
 Wontonimo: it'll work for this puzzle
 SinsIsHereLadies: What is your area of expertise in programming? if you don't mind
 Wontonimo: back end systems
 Wontonimo: you?
 Wontonimo: whyx0 = x1 + ( (x2 - x1) / 2);
 Wontonimo: instead of x0 = (x2 + x1) / 2;
 PerspectiveOfTed: hm?
 nikelhaus: e_fishel ruby is even shorter than python
 Thorcode: hey wontonimo, could you help me to get to the bomb in very hard
 Thorcode: I have updated my maxium alot
 Thorcode: but the last one the find the bomb is  hard when my arena is about 3x3 or larger than a bit
 Wontonimo: in episode 1
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Thorcode: nah ep 2
 Thorcode: whwen the bombdir is same
 Thorcode: I got close to the bomb now

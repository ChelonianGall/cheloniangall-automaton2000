 FishyDEV:  Hello WOrld!
 mericho: hi
 mericho: how can i work with this 
 Dead_Eye: hii
 mericho: i'm noob please help me 
 mericho: :100:
 Dead_Eye: haha
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: happy Codejam
 eulerscheZahl: there's even D support
 jacek: Dodejam?
 emh: eulerscheZahl I started last night hehe
 eulerscheZahl: are you trying to solve all problems?
 emh: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i decided not to try the last one (Indicium)
 eulerscheZahl: time to avoid mines
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: Is there a chance to go gold without tracking opponent paths?
 eulerscheZahl: is there a chance to see you using your main account?
 eulerscheZahl: for your question: i don't know the answer
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: I will be using after my stream
 eulerscheZahl: streaming OOC? or locam again?
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: I will stream OOC and some other stuff today for my institutes open days for future wannabe student
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: That's why I'm testing some stuff from this acc
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: I will advertise later, but sadly it will be in Polish
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: And more advertising like 'what in AI4Games we do in our lab'
 eulerscheZahl: apart from that it's all about CG? or other sites like RAIC too?
 eulerscheZahl: or competitive programming (codeforces)?
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: Thank you that's nice idea I can mention thse two
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: actually I'm only in CG cause I use it for teaching and stuff, and I'm not into the really competition programming
 eulerscheZahl: CG isn't even that competitive, more about forming a community.try streaming a topcoder marathon, you'll most likely get disqualified
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: An that's why I like CG 
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: and ability to create own games/puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, the sdk is a great feature
 dbdr: and learning from each other
 dbdr: still you're not supposed to stream a legend bot
 eulerscheZahl: i just did the interactive problem on codejam. usually it takes more time for me to do the stdin/stdout than to solve the actual problem
 eulerscheZahl: sure, there are rules which ideas to stream/share. the top ranks are a competition
 eulerscheZahl: this time codejam described and extra input line we have to read. but wasn't there, i guess they changed the protocol but not the specs
 eulerscheZahl: or did i get lost in the wall of text? :thinking:
 inoryy: silver boss sometimes crashes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445265942">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445265942</a>
 eulerscheZahl: blame whoever wrote that boss
 inoryy: shame you, whoever wrote that boss
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: That give us all silvers some chance :D
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy uses SILENCE a lot. maybe timing out as the tracker path grows
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: you said chucknorris == csipsirip&#160;?
 chucknorris: yes
 chucknorris: I was surprised that this nick is free. I had to take it 
 Lostrick: can anyone help me with the 3xN tiling?
 Lostrick: it's medium but I don't know how to do it at all
 eulerscheZahl: no, i said Csipcsirip = chucknorris (with an extra c)
 AntiSquid: why no camel case chucknorris&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: or pascal case
 sohang: What is the meaning of "MSG" action?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445260738">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445260738</a>check the text below the player avatars on the sides sohang
 eulerscheZahl: MSG your textthat will print a text below your picture. it's just for debugging and has no effect to the gameplay
 chucknorris: Jesus my bot went 2ply. but the oppenent was fighting vs himself
 Famout: Haven't been back here in some time, time to try Ocean. 
 tranculent: do we have 15 days to complete the Ocean challenge? Isn't that quite excessive time frame for the task or am I missing something?
 Famout: As someone who is a casual here, I kinda like it.
 tranculent: Nah, don't get me wrong, I like it too, I was just wondering if I just over-simplify it is all haha
 Uljahn: what do you mean by "to complete"?
 tranculent: Mb, not complete but "work on"
 AntiSquid: are you gold yet tranculent&#160;?
 Uljahn: hehe
 tranculent: I'm not, I'm new to this website
 Uljahn: you're supposed to compete, not to complete
 AntiSquid: get highest possible rank by the end of the contest
 AntiSquid: also get an avatar for +5% win rate bonus
 tranculent: right, thanks for the info :P 
 Famout: If you are new as well a bit of extra info for ya, each League adds a new twist to the game you need to code for.
 Famout: So write code you can build on :p
 tranculent: that sounds cool, thank you&#160;:) 
 tranculent: so far, I really like this website, the clashes and the Ocean challenge
 Uljahn: eww clashes
 tranculent: what's wrong with them :D
 AntiSquid: personally don't like being rushed, feels like having to swim to escape a shark instead of just swimming for leisure 
 tranculent: yeah, fair point. however I feel like I am improving more that way
 tranculent: as in general I'm quite bad at solving coding challenges
 Famout: Do what you enjoy, any coding is an improvement
 AntiSquid: Uljahn just curious, when did you last improve your bot?
 Uljahn: im improving it rn
 Uljahn: arena bot is 8 days old
 AntiSquid: using your bot as point of reference, since ladder was shuffled, just now made some changes
 Famout: Goal for tonight is to shake off the rust, and get a simple A* pathfinding setup done so I can just putt my ship around the whole screen before needing to surface. 
 Famout: ....And all the error checking code too, I miss breakpoints
 chucknorris: debugging your code offline with dummy input can save a lot of time
 Famout: I could see that
 YannT: eulerscheZahl: you've got issues I think&#160;;)
 YannT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445305066">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445305066</a>
 YannT: forgot to add back current position to path after surfacing? :p
 eulerscheZahl: interesting, thanks!
 YannT:&#160;:)
 Mr_YT: hi
 b0ot: any idea why charCodeAt() wouldn't have worked in Javascript?
 elderlybeginner: python: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a90380ab-0764-45db-8709-13f47c15dbc4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a90380ab-0764-45db-8709-13f47c15dbc4</a>
 elderlybeginner: python: 
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even know that python supports complex numbers :o
 elderlybeginner: i'm using it for x,y grids, works wonderfully
 eulerscheZahl: the problem here is just the python part. way too slow to be competitive if you want to simulate some turns
 eulerscheZahl: (i'm aware that there's a python bot ranked above me)
 inoryy: elderlybeginner use numpy instead
 inoryy: unless there's like 50 people hiding their bots, I think OOC is one of the more balanced games in terms of languages
 elderlybeginner: indeed, there was something else :joy:
 elderlybeginner: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2968b16a-5876-4871-80da-9f90271302db">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2968b16a-5876-4871-80da-9f90271302db</a>
 elderlybeginner: I cannot remove elements that way, only coping now?
 eulerscheZahl: you modify a collection while iterating over it
 inoryy: what are you trying to do
 eulerscheZahl: under the hood it's probably doing a for loop with the index
 eulerscheZahl: 0,1,2,3
 eulerscheZahl: and you delete element 0
 eulerscheZahl: so the new element 1 from the loop is the actual 2
 elderlybeginner: removing all elements with real part over 14
 elderlybeginner: yes, I think I know what's going on now. Coping leftover without elements to cut off to another list seems the solution
 inoryy: &gt; a = [13+0j, 13+1j, 13+2j, 14+0j]&gt; b = [x for x in a if x.real &gt; 13]&gt; b == [13+0j, 13+1j, 13+2j]
 eulerscheZahl: b is exactly the opposite inoryy
 inoryy: ha, you're right
 inoryy: &gt; b = [x for x in a if x.real &lt; 14]
 inoryy: but again, numpy is what you really want here
 inoryy: w, h, pid = map(int, readline().split())grid = [input() for _ in range(h)]grid = np.array([[grid[y][x] == '.' for y in range(w)] for x in range(h)])
 yfprojects: Which JDKs am I able to use with JRE 1.8.0&#160;?
 yfprojects: in Java
 MadKnight: who knows who knows...
 yfprojects: Someone has to know
 AntiSquid: i use intellj 
 eulerscheZahl: how does that help with the question?
 AntiSquid:  /kick MadKnight @_@
 AntiSquid: do you mean me euler? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i got the question right: the user wants to compile a program so that it can be executed with JRE 1.8
 eulerscheZahl: with JDK 1.8 you are on the safe side
 eulerscheZahl: it might be possible to use a higher version (in C# you can use some newer features and still compile to a lower .net version), but i don't know if that applies for Java too
 AntiSquid: well i don't mind telling which jdk &amp; jre i have but no idea how to check exactly
 AntiSquid: i get this: javac -versionjavac 1.8.0_
 eulerscheZahl: ~ javac -versionjavac 14-ea
 AntiSquid: i think i used both 8 and 11 at some point (JDK)
 yfprojects: So the runtime environment is not connected to the development kid?
 eulerscheZahl: you only need the JRE to execute a java program
 eulerscheZahl: and JDK to compile it
 yfprojects: ...and the byte code stays the same?
 eulerscheZahl: if you use newer language features (higher JDK version), you might not be able to run it with an outdated JRE
 eulerscheZahl: (that is the person you share your binaries with)
 eulerscheZahl: JDK = java development kitJRE = java runtime environment
 inoryy: if I silence over multiple cells are all prohibited on the next turn or only the final one?
 AntiSquid: all
 inoryy: ouch
 pb4: You're playing inoryy&#160;?
 Counterbalance: yfprojects for jdk 1.8 and older you can specify -source and -target; -target 6 for instance produces bytecode for java 1.6. For jdk 1.9 and up, there's a -release flag, which does the same but also links against the correct runtime (so java 9 code will be linked against the java 8 libraries if you specify -release 8)
 inoryy: pb4 a little bit on the weekends&#160;:)
 inoryy: I see you're taking it seriously this time?
 pb4: I got hooked
 pb4: Didn't think I could enjoy an imperfect information game
 pb4: But it strikes the right balance of """opponent detectability""" and most importantly "should I do this action knowing that I'll reveal myself"
 eulerscheZahl: i'm curious what CG has in mind for their next planned contest in May
 eulerscheZahl: and what this is about <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/CodinGame/status/1246110607419547648">https://twitter.com/CodinGame/status/1246110607419547648</a>
 dbdr: not a reverse engineering puzzle&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Would be nice if it was a finished version of that pacman multi
 JBM: There Is No Pacman Multi
 Astrobytes: Not a finished multi

 eulerscheZahl: i asked thibaud, he says that game has nothing to do with it
 Astrobytes: Shame
 Astrobytes: Might be PacMan racing... :smirk:
 AntiSquid: better that way, since some people already knew about it
 eulerscheZahl: pacman strikes back
 AntiSquid: do the ghosts revive in pacman?
 JBM: yes
 blasterpoard: inb4 we get a pacman skin for kutulu
 AntiSquid: premium members only
 YannT: how can I play in IDE a replay when I only have a link to it (it's not from  my last battles tab)
 blasterpoard: YannT your best bet is copying enemy commands into a file and making a PHP bot out of them, I think
 eulerscheZahl: hardcode your opponent

 YannT: eww
 YannT: no way to emulate the "send to IDE" feature?&#160;:(
 JBM: there most likely is, but nobody's take the time to package it yet
 JBM: well.. and publish O:-)
 eulerscheZahl: is the opponent the most recent version of that player?
 eulerscheZahl: and is it deterministic?
 eulerscheZahl: you know that you can set the seed for a map, right?
 YannT: no, how? that'd be all I need
 eulerscheZahl: left: settings: expert mode
 eulerscheZahl: then in the player selection in the IDE
 YannT: ohhh
 eulerscheZahl: options -&gt; manual
 YannT: perfect!
 eulerscheZahl: seed=&lt;xxx&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: you see the seed in the details below each replay
 eulerscheZahl: you are on CG for almost 2 yearssomehow i assumed you would know that :D
 kovi: lets ban undeterministic bots
 kovi: i haveto guessdebug more and more in last few days
 YannT: once you don't have any bugs anymore and all features are in, it becomes a winrate game anyway
 AntiSquid: TODO: add more randomness
 kovi: yeah, when i dont have bugs, i will do that for revenge&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: run fixed seed in IDE / locally and submit without fixed seed
 dbdr: YannT you can get the seed from the replay
 dbdr: and then set it in the IDE
 YannT: yeah I got it, it works  :)
 YannT: I honestly didn't know about export mode
 YannT: I'm an expert now
 eulerscheZahl: scroll down in your chat dbdr
 dbdr: sorry, was already said
 dbdr: yeah :D
 AntiSquid: fake chucknorris on leaderboard, real one would be #1
 kovi: but he is #1 leaderboard is lagging behind
 kovi: (or plain wrong)
 YannT: I have rewritten my eval
 YannT: not sure if better or terrible :o
 AntiSquid: "Game Summary:Not enough charges of SILENCE" Someone tries to play silence every turn .
 MadKnight: it's still not enough
 eulerscheZahl: don't you do offline testing to evaluate that YannT?
 YannT: I did, it seems conclusive
 YannT: but also my bot does weird shit sometimes
 YannT: so I have zero confidence :p
 YannT: more testing and tuning is required I think
 AntiSquid: if (x = 1)again this bug T_T
 eulerscheZahl: some writeif (1 = x)to avoid this
 eulerscheZahl: personally i'm not a fan of it
 dbdr: others use a proper compiler with sane options that detect it
 dbdr: why waste your time on this?
 dbdr: in C, -Wall should warn about this, no?
 kovi: lucky rolls
 icecream17: how would you do offline testing
 eulerscheZahl: clone the referee repo, add your own bot in the test/Main.java

 Melf: Dose anyone solved MIME Type in Python?I have a problem to print "UNKNOWN"
 MadKnight: i did Melf
 MadKnight: what's the problem&#160;?
 Melf: if i print("UNKNOWN") it says Failure Found Nothing
 Melf: if i write "unknown" it fails with found: "unknown" soo i think  there might be another problem.
 eulerscheZahl: YannT payback time here's a bug of yours: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445414495">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445414495</a>

 YannT: eheh yeah I've noticed, if life==1 and no available tiles, I timeout :D
 Salenger: wow ranked 816 at coders-strike-back gold league
 AntiSquid: only looks like a good rank because of the few hundred thousand players
 AntiSquid: oh nevermind, it's stil under 100k
 eulerscheZahl: and CSB has a low ratio of players who really try
 eulerscheZahl: we are great at motivating people
 eulerscheZahl: keep going Salenger!
 YannT: I'm actually thinking of putting log(x)*5 for a thing in my eval function
 YannT: this is either genius or completely stupid, probably the later ahah
 eulerscheZahl: i went with exp(-x)
 kovi: what is x?
 YannT: oh that's terrible, that will not do at all
 eulerscheZahl: i won't tell you what my x is
 kovi: i asked yannt, not you&#160;;)
 YannT: pretty sure I figured it out :p
 YannT: we're doing the same thing essentially I think
 kovi: i had log idea for something, but forgot already what that wss

 YannT: alright, running cgbenchmark using the power of logarithms
 chucknorris: thx for the log idea btw worked well :p 
 YannT: lets see if MATHS can improve ranking
 chucknorris: I still have terrile winrate against pb4 tho
 YannT: it would indeed appear to work better with MATHS
 YannT: I still have the issue of acting a bit like a suicide bomber sometimes
 chucknorris: yeah I'm thinking about adding some maths to my code. and a bit of science
 YannT: noo never add science
 kovi: what is with this logarithm again?
 YannT: you'll end up like MSmits coding around impossible possibilities
 eulerscheZahl: adding math + science is considered as cheating
 YannT: alright, new eval is a go
 YannT: it's annoying how the line numbers in crashes in the IDE don't correspond to anything
 Swagboy: Yes this or no lines sometimes
 Swagboy: What I've been doing, on a Vry advice, is to print all input for some game in order to play them on local
 YannT: could not be bothered yet to set up something like this
 Swagboy: I think I won some time all in all
 Swagboy: But not quite sure because of some input formatting headaches
 Vry: Swagboy, you ping me? :D
 YannT: eulerscheZahl: the power of MATHS appears to be working
 eulerscheZahl: oh no, another user who will give me headache
 duckquackduck: for ocean of code, only one player move per round? 
 duckquackduck: either you or the opponent? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it's a turn-based game
 hackerjl: hi
 hackerjl: hello
 duckquackduck: thanks, so each game loop, is your turn only? (as in you only get a gameloop when you can make a move?)
 duckquackduck: hello hackerjl
 eulerscheZahl: yes, your bot will only be executed on your turn
 duckquackduck: ahh, cool thankyou eulerscheZahl! 
 Swagboy: Vry acknowledging you for some advice!
 SabertheLost: The readline function that is avaiable in the TypeScript version of the ide. How do I get a similar one to that so that my visual studio code does not complain?
 YannT: I think we sqhould consider not pushing all at the time time...
 YannT: we're cramping each other's respective styles  :p
 Counterbalance: Salenger you'd have to implement that yourself. I have code for nodejs if you like but I'm not sure i it's useful for typescript
 Counterbalance: ohh that was meant for SabertheLost 
 SabertheLost: Yea, i was, that he murdered my name&#160;:) 
 Counterbalance: tab completion&#160;:(
 slamo: can you surface and move in the same turn?
 eulerscheZahl: yes you can Salenger
 SabertheLost: That sounds strange, the hole point of surface is that you stand still and do not move. At least in the board game.
 eulerscheZahl: and to kill <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445475140">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445475140</a>
 SabertheLost: what, so you can surface, move , shoot and move silence in the same turn+
 struct: as long as you dont repeat the same action
 SabertheLost: but move and silence (aka move) is in my opinion the same action and should be be possible at the same turn
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a problem with allowing bothand disallowing now will result in justified complains by those who implemented using that feature
 Astrobytes: You can SILENCE with 0 distance though
 struct: They are considered different
 SabertheLost: Same with surface', your moving to the surface not forwards. 
 AntiSquid: all actions being possible same turn is absolutely fine imo
 YannT: the power of MATHS is workiiing :D
 AntiSquid: the slow leaderboard update is really irritating
 RickHodder: question, i'm trying to set up external code editor, i have installed the chrome extension, but i dont know what the next step is - i'm using vscode

 AntiSquid: i still don't beat boss, fail!&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: 1 win&#160;!! finally lol
 eulerscheZahl: i thought you like touch bossesyou were even against nerfing wood bosses
 Zenoscave: just not tough for him&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: only maybe if they are female and good lucking, otherwise no
 eulerscheZahl: more a sadist than a masochist
 eulerscheZahl: good lucking? i'm tempted to risk a strike by suggesting a typo correction
 AntiSquid: the issue, is if i commit to something and then it gets nerfed it's really annoying, also wasn't complaining about the boss
 AntiSquid: just rambling about my failure
 AntiSquid: hhaaha
 AntiSquid: well your wrote touch instead of tough
 AntiSquid: also what strike? i don't get it
 AntiSquid: actually you get a strike, reach 1000 and you're out
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even notice my typo
 eulerscheZahl: in baseball it's 3 strikes
 eulerscheZahl: on youtube too i think
 tempux: did anyone used python for codejam?
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo did
 Zenoscave: Shit i forgot codejam again
 RoboStac: I did
 eulerscheZahl: still running
 Zenoscave: great
 AntiSquid: go use python Zenobia
 Zenoscave: lol
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave 
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: I didn't know go was written in python
 AntiSquid: i'll see myself out .
 eulerscheZahl: 6h remaining, you need 30 points
 tempux: I seem to get runtime error on codejam for the sample test cases
 tempux: using python
 RoboStac: are you using f strings?
 tempux: yes
 RoboStac: yeah, their python is out of date and doesn't support them
 tempux: oh okay
 tempux: thanks
 tempux: i solve first two using c++
 RoboStac: they're still using 3.5 
 eulerscheZahl: and i thought CG is slow at language updates
 tempux: I didn't want to reimplement the third one with c++ again 
 tempux: :thumbsup:
 Liftyee: can you surface, then dive, then move in the same turn/
 Liftyee:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: dive = silence? yes you can
 RoboStac: yes, you can do all 7 actions in one turn, you just can't do any single action more than once per turn
 Doubt_Cloudy: does the order of actions matter? like if all the tiles are previously visited, is move then surface instaloss but surface then move ok?
 eulerscheZahl: order matters
 Astrobytes: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: also for your torpedo range which changes after moving
 eulerscheZahl: or to fully charge and then directly use your torpedo
 Doubt_Cloudy: oh so u can shoot at your old spot then move to a new spot before handing over turn to opponent?
 wlesavo: damn, my fatality is bad, it does not consider quite a few possibilities
 eulerscheZahl: yes Doubt_Cloudy
 Doubt_Cloudy: ooh ok
 eulerscheZahl: i'm willing to exchange my killer move vs your movement wlesavo
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl :smiley:
 kovi: top is quite packed
 eulerscheZahl: where does the top end for you? below #6?
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i would say my movement was in part inherited from number shifting
 eulerscheZahl: hm, interesting
 wlesavo: but looking at the top there are probably quite a few better ones already
 YannT: I have good fatality but I also do non fatal suicide bombing sometimes :p
 YannT: SILENCE  4 | TORPEDO *dead*
 wlesavo: i try not to torpedo after silence
 YannT: I take a more hands off approach to bot management, I prefer to let it express its creativity  :p
 YannT: and apparently it has the heart of a kamikaze, who am I to judge
 wlesavo: that is somethong a wise god would say :slight_smile:
 struct: close fight at top still
 eulerscheZahl: i don't expect to see a clear winner with 2 points ahead at the end
 YannT: coming for you kovi :D
 struct: you are probably right
 YannT: -0.01
 struct: I wonder if anyone is hiding
 eulerscheZahl: i'm hiding my submarinebut torpedoes still hit me
 struct: fix it
 YannT: speaking of hiding, I try to calculate torpedo options when there's like 200 possible ennemy positions and it takes  a bit of time apparently
 AntiSquid: is there no perfect or semi-perfect hiding?
 YannT: who would've thunk it
 chucknorris: hm I dont even try to shoot yet when there are more than 9 possible locations
 eulerscheZahl: when you invest all your energy in hiding, you can't fire torpedoes anymore AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: because you have to charge them too
 AntiSquid: isn't silence + mines a good idea?
 YannT: silence spam means you don't have time for mines
 AntiSquid: don't spam, do both .
 AntiSquid: 9 in total or 9 around you chucknorris
 chucknorris: I only shoot when the hit chance is 100% I know its not really good
 Swagboy: Mine spams means the opp know where your mine where dropped from
 YannT: AntiSquid: doing both is pretty much the meta... mine spam is something else&#160;;)
 YannT: it means you don't silence or very little, and that's usually not good
 kovi: nagra did great doing mine spam for quite a few days. but with mine avoidance he is down
 AntiSquid: but that's what i asked YannT
 AntiSquid: chucknorris your twin:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/45d40dac5af96d1ad3cdd6e45b3f1bd61647851">https://www.codingame.com/profile/45d40dac5af96d1ad3cdd6e45b3f1bd61647851</a>
 chucknorris: nice
 wlesavo: yeah, nagra did really good without silence, i think he can do better using it though
 linjoehan: did yall do google?
 YannT: you're not determenistic chucknorris?
 YannT: or did I just bug something :p
 chucknorris: no my bot is not deterministic. and has a lot of bugs too :D 
 YannT: ah, that explains why I can't reproduce a thing then
 icecream17: I don't feel like doing ocean of code anymore....
 YannT: take a break and come back to it?
 AntiSquid: hey icecream17 i hate it from day 1 and i am still at it
 AntiSquid: well i mean day 1 of contest, when i first tried it i didn't notice how annoying silence is
 AntiSquid: but why not play some other multi then? there's massive variety icecream17
 Albeast: /message dadbeast
 icecream17: if you just move and silence at random directions and track and put random bombs every 20 moves, after 300 moves you're set to win
 teccles: What's the current contest like?
 AntiSquid: well you remember unleash the geek?
 teccles: Vividly
 AntiSquid: kinda like that one, but more things to take into account imo
 AntiSquid: and i think i enjoyed that one a little more
 teccles: Thanks&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: teccles incomplete information once again
 kovi: hey teccles
 teccles: Hey!
 kovi: almost turtlish game
 teccles: Cool. So, bots are heuristic rather than heavy search?
 kovi: for now yes
 teccles: Ah yes, two weeks in and python is at #3
 AntiSquid: that's an exception
 teccles: Hey it's captain sonar!
 teccles: That's a great game
 YannT: it is&#160;:)
 YannT: sounds like a new challenger has entered the arena :grin:
 blasterpoard: #2 is taken
 wlesavo: i was #1 for couple of days even, right before gold :slight_smile: but yeah, slipping down now, have not much time to improove
 Zenoscave: Ah 23 points so far on GCJ I'm stuck with a Wrong answer on the Parenting problem
 struct: it has a few differences teccles
 struct: here you cant destroy mines
 wlesavo: blasterpoard for a sec, some tops are resubing
 teccles: Oh, if #2 is taken I guess I'm out
 blasterpoard: wlesavo I was talking about teccles taking it once again
 NinjaDoggy: lol teccles the #2 god :P
 AntiSquid: a lot of random atm
 icecream17: Hey, I have an idea, what if you have 2 different modes? One for silence players and one for everyone else?
 teccles: Which is weird, because consistently getting #2 is clearly impossible&#160;:(
 wlesavo: oh i see, out of context
 kovi: that is why you won halite 3&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: but you'll always be second to the best!
 teccles: Oh, UTG is live and my bot is still there!
 teccles: I might flip a flag and see if I could have trivially won
 blasterpoard: it was reopened at around the same time the contest started
 AntiSquid: now they automatically push the bot to the multi
 blasterpoard: not much time to do anything yet
 blasterpoard: btw if you'll keep submitting your utg bot, I'll go down to #20 there
 AntiSquid: just need some luck @_@ RNGesus heed my call
 teccles: I won't keep submitting it - just changing one setting to see how much I should kick myself
 AntiSquid: go go jbl&#160;! push me drop boss&#160;! :o
 Astrobytes: Pray harder to RNGesus AntiSquid
 Zenoscave: AHHHH I can't figuer out my bug on GCJ
 Astrobytes: oh teccles has finally arrived
 teccles: Maybe. Not sure if I'm joining.
 Astrobytes: Pushed for time or not keen?
 AntiSquid: i shall kick/ban Automaton2000 as an offering to RNG deities
 Automaton2000: and see what they do with the way i do it in a while
 teccles: I kind of decided to stop doing these
 The_Duck: D: why?
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: GOLD :o
 teccles: They eat my life and I think there might be better things to do with my time
 AntiSquid: not kicking Automaton2000 though, hehe, scammed RNGesus
 Automaton2000: i cant do anything with them
 teccles: But then again, I don't actually *do* better things with my time&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 The_Duck: I love having my life eaten by these&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: gz Squiddo
 The_Duck: I am sad I am only now getting to this one&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: 2 weeks time though
 kovi: game is on....so will recurse join aswell?
 AntiSquid: thx astro, looks like i will be glued to the bottom of gold though
 Astrobytes: Better than stuck at 2nd silver at least&#160;;)
 teccles: Is it possible to look at the rules for this game without joining the contest?
 kovi: afaik if you dont submit you wont be "counted" as playing
 struct: but he cant see all rules though
 Astrobytes: structs bronze rules pic incoming

 teccles: Cheers
 icecream17: Wow! The error appeared as early as move 10 - and the opponent didn't even silence! yay!
 icecream17: welp i'm going to the ocean

 YannT: *banzai!*
 MostComplicatedUsername: Random torpedo for the win

 icecream17: so i was working on astrobytes idea to make damage arrays, and i realized... instead of shifting, just add the specific damage from a space before the oppmove, then add the damage from the space after the move. you don't need to total damage array. 
 <b>**MostComplicatedUsername Has no idea what icecream17 is talking about</b></p><p><img src="/a/42082469656497" /> icecream17: Torpedo hits, then move, then mine,
 icecream17: so the torpedo damage, then shift the position only, then take mine
 teccles: I think I'm out of this one... I don't quite have the energy for it right now. Good luck everyone!
 AntiSquid: thanks
 icecream17: whoa how did your username disappear
 NinjaDoggy: anyone on right now willing to answer some questions about tracking silence?&#160;:)
 icecream17: you can't
 icecream17: but track as much as possible!
 NinjaDoggy: @YannT are you still only tracking positions?
 Astrobytes: icecream17 I think you tagged me in error
 icecream17: so it wasn't your idea..? but i'm sure in the chat/// nevermind just know i stole some idea from someone
 AntiSquid: nothing stolen, it was shared 24/7 in chat and on stream 
 icecream17: hmm should i keep track of who i get ideas from?
 Astrobytes: Not me no, I think I remember the conversation though
 YannT: NinjaDoggy: no paths
 YannT: I was tracking only positions in like 
 Astrobytes: icecream17 you don't keep notes?
 YannT: bronze
 icecream17: ..................................(error: timeout)
 NinjaDoggy: hm...
 NinjaDoggy: so you're very approximately tracking silence then?
 NinjaDoggy: since paths give you a lot of information about silence possibilities
 Zenoscave: I drop any path after the first 900 or so
 NinjaDoggy: for example if someone does silence N 1 followed by move E
 YannT: if you're talking about the replay, this is a case of  me suiciding to avoid an ennemy mine
 icecream17: no..... sorry
 YannT: obviously not ideal behavior
 NinjaDoggy: does your code rule out the possibility of silence W 1?
 NinjaDoggy: no i'm talking in general, not about replay
 YannT: ah, no it doesn't
 YannT: of course not
 NinjaDoggy: hm... ok
 NinjaDoggy: cuz that's the decision i'm trying to make right now
 YannT: in this case I used silence to "jump over" a mine, except it left me with 1 life and nowhere to go to :p
 NinjaDoggy: trade of between run/code time and robustness 
 NinjaDoggy: ahh rip
 YannT: I don't consider silence 0 as an option for myself
 NinjaDoggy: ok thanks
 Zenoscave: I dropped around 20 ranks&#160;:/ I am not doing well in gold
 NinjaDoggy: i feel like even top gold bots
 NinjaDoggy: are tracking quite poorly&#160;:/
 NinjaDoggy: like not making use of damage taken from torpedo to eliminate positions
 NinjaDoggy: and stuff
 Zenoscave: then come beat us up
 NinjaDoggy: will do :D
 Zenoscave: We do that though...
 NinjaDoggy: ok maybe there's not as much info as I thought from the replay then
 AntiSquid: it's more annoying than it looks 
 wlesavo: NinjaDoggy you are quite wrong
 icecream17: tracking paths is how much better? 1.7x?
 icecream17: also, does the month-glass in the top left actually go down over time? i can't tell, too slow
 MostComplicatedUsername: Don't think so
 MostComplicatedUsername: Cus there's less than half left and the hourglass has more than half at the top
 wlesavo: NinjaDoggy the numbers printed out are usually delayed one turn, but overall pretty acurate and reliable across all the players
 Zenoscave: wlesavo do you see much wrong with my bot? I'm running low on ideas
 AntiSquid: purchase a fix it toolkit from MadKnight
 Zenoscave: MadKnight how much will that cost
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445562877">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445562877</a>
 MadKnight: fix it toolkit&#160;?
 MadKnight: wait i got a link
 Zenoscave: sweet
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Sewing_Kit">https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Sewing_Kit</a>
 MadKnight: here's the fix it toolkit
 Zenoscave: thanks
 Zenoscave: I'll use it now
 MostComplicatedUsername: ummmmm
 MostComplicatedUsername: :no_mouth:
 MadKnight: MostComplicatedUsername u don't know don't starve game&#160;?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Nope
 MadKnight: BAN
 MadKnight: STRUCTBAN
 MostComplicatedUsername: Um
 MadKnight: struct plays it too
 MostComplicatedUsername: Sorry?
 MadKnight: what
 MadKnight: i was just trolling 
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well
 MadKnight: don't take it seriously lol
 wlesavo: Zenoscave well the meta is mine escaping, your bot does not seems to do that
 MadKnight: MostComplicatedUsername do u like open-world survival kind of games&#160;?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes
 MostComplicatedUsername: Like Subn
 MadKnight: try don't starve MostComplicatedUsername
 MadKnight: u might like it
 Zenoscave: How do you track mines? just probability of placement on each action?
 AntiSquid: ya MostComplicatedUsername just write his username in your blacklist-booklet, one day you'll meet him and pay him back, no need to be so serious now 
 wlesavo: Zenoscave well you can have all the possible possitions, just average the damage and you good
 Zenoscave: Thanks
 MostComplicatedUsername: um
 MostComplicatedUsername: okay...
 kovi: but that makes harder to remove all when one is triggered
 Zenoscave: how? Position to int hashmap
 Zenoscave: when one triggers set value to 0
 wlesavo: Zenoscave when one is triggered you have to remove phantoms as well but accoint for duplicates as well
 wlesavo: accounting
 Zenoscave: got it
 DEIZ21: guys how many lines your code is?&#160;:)
 DEIZ21: mine 1700
 icecream17: i have 1614 but also a 120 line comment at the end
 Zenoscave: 120 line comment!?
 icecream17: yeah just put ideas and explanations and possible useful code in there. also to debug
 icecream17: mostly to debug actually
 The_Duck: when you use silence, can you cross over your own path?
 Zenoscave: no The_Duck
 kovi: no
 The_Duck: ok cool
 The_Duck: and do all the squares that you pass over count as "visited"?
 Zenoscave: yes
 kovi: yes
 icecream17: weird how you both answer at the same time
 Zenoscave: not really
 The_Duck: thanks both&#160;:)
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 kovi: my msgs displayed with 20+sec lag in forum
 Zenoscave: same here on occasion kovi
 MadKnight: just use random
 MadKnight: &gt;  How do you track mines? just probability of placement on each action? 
 lNitsua: does the IDE for ocean of code save non submitted code?
 lNitsua: without submitting?
 lNitsua: I lost some non submitted code, and I did a lot and don't want to lose it
 The_Duck: so you can move and silence in the same turn right?
 superfx12: I dont think you can
 mlomb: you can
 The_Duck: hm, my opponent seems to be doing move + zero-distance-silence in the same turn but maybe I am confused
 superfx12: really?
 The_Duck: oh ok you can
 superfx12: He is charging silence
 superfx12: He is not using it
 The_Duck: his output looks like
 The_Duck: "MOVE S TORPEDO|SILENCE N 0"
 superfx12: Oh, I dont know then
 mlomb: He charged the torpedo, then silenced and moved 0
 superfx12: And you can silence 0?
 mlomb: not moved*
 mlomb: yup
 The_Duck: ok so I assume also "MOVE N TORPEDO|SILENCE N 4"is also allowed?
 mlomb: yes
 superfx12: That changes everything ive done
 The_Duck: cool thanks mlomb
 superfx12: Yea, thanks!
 mlomb: you can do any combination you want, as long you have cooldown and don't issue the same command twice
 mlomb: also you could use "MINE" and not move at all
 superfx12: Yea, I thought it was Move/Silence Charge | Other action
 superfx12: Can you Move|Silence|Tropedo?
 rwilson: yes
 rwilson: at least 1 action and at most 1 of each KIND of action ( move, surface,torpedo,sonar,silence,mine,trigger )
 rwilson: FYI - anyone can confirm for themselves by browsing through through the referee code listed in the rules
 superfx12: Thanks going to look through it!

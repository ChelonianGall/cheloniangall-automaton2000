 Andriamanitra: shame?
 Andriamanitra: i tried to save a few characters in shortest mode by changing 360/(2*Math::PI) to 57.2958, passed all the visible tests but failed some of the validators ;_;
 Andriamanitra: i would've won by like 40 characters even without shortening that bit :disappointed:
 DrMobius: your solution was impressively short tho
 Andriamanitra: yeah i was pretty happy with it, too greedy though
 eulerscheZahl: you could have done 180/Math::PI at least
 Andriamanitra: yeah i had that for a brief moment of sanity
 zheheng: i wish ppl could share their code , when they get 100%.. so others can learn from them

 eulerscheZahl: come on trictrac, do you really want to fight this war?&#160;:/
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;???
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I see no trictrac

 eulerscheZahl: i do
 Gorbit99: love how the creator is only 4th
 Gorbit99: how hard is samegame to write code for?
 eulerscheZahl: not that hard
 eulerscheZahl: now i have 2 algos. some are better at one testcase, some at the other
 eulerscheZahl: wider beam size did the trick
 Andriamanitra: you really think your wide beams are going to save you when i get my algorithm done?
 Andriamanitra: i just need to figure out how to generate two random numbers between  0 and 14 and i'll be golden!
 eulerscheZahl: i dont know how good you are. but beam search is too obvious for me to be the only one using it
 Gorbit99: well, if you explain it, I can tell you how obvious it is
 eulerscheZahl: i start with the initial board, generate all possible follow-up boards that i can obtain by removing a group
 Gorbit99: so far so good
 eulerscheZahl: score those based on current game score + expected score for the remainder
 eulerscheZahl: then only take the best X boards of those
 eulerscheZahl: and do the expand+score again until the game is over
 eulerscheZahl: aka beam search
 Andriamanitra: well yea but the odds of finding optimal solution doing that seem pretty miniscule compared to my rng-based artificial intelligence
 eulerscheZahl: aCat is doing what you describe. score of 38ki'm at 69k
 Gorbit99: ah
 Gorbit99: nice
 Gorbit99: so basically a 1 step monte carlo?
 eulerscheZahl: at least i think that's what he does
 Gorbit99: I'll display that follow somewhere on my wall
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Andriamanitra: ok you win i cant get my rng to work
 Gorbit99: don't worry, right now I'm failing on creating a flood fill
 Andriamanitra: your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur
 eulerscheZahl: i get that too
 eulerscheZahl: as i solve the whole thing in turn 1 and ignore the following inputs
 Gorbit99: oh, you just run through the entire thing?
 eulerscheZahl: when i print the first action, i already know my final score
 Gorbit99: I assume there's tons of heuristics in place to not get you timed out
 eulerscheZahl: not at all. still early in the game
 Gorbit99: you get 20 seconds for the first turn?
 eulerscheZahl: and it's an optim game. sooner or later top ranks will solve it offline and hardcode
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 20s
 Gorbit99: solve it offline and hardcode?
 Gorbit99: isn't it sorta randomised?
 eulerscheZahl: the testcases are always the same
 Gorbit99: ah
 Gorbit99: nice
 eulerscheZahl: bulls and cows has random tests
 Gorbit99: that's a bit lame
 Gorbit99: 20 seconds is hilariously a lot
 Gorbit99: at that point the main problem is memory
 eulerscheZahl: depends on what you are doing
 eulerscheZahl: my solution would still get better with more time
 Gorbit99: aren't you brute forcing it?
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree. i can't do a full search in 20s
 Gorbit99: what lang btw?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/481565931">https://www.codingame.com/replay/481565931</a>but you can clearly see that my solver has a mission
 eulerscheZahl: C#
 Gorbit99: big blobs
 Gorbit99: you get 1000 points for clearing the board, so I guess that's the main goal to shoot for
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i don't do that yet. but it's not easy to achieve
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/brick/">http://www.hacker.org/brick/</a>i never got far on this one
 Andriamanitra: why am i selecting empty tiles though
 tutubalin: so my first task as a hacker is to run Adobe Flash on Mac
 Andriamanitra: seems like rng-based artificial intelligence should know better
 eulerscheZahl: -1 is a huge block with an awesome score
 Gorbit99: ^
 eulerscheZahl: and you got confused by the input format, rows given in reverse order
 Andriamanitra: i see, my algorithm is fine but game is bugged
 Gorbit99: ...oh
 Gorbit99: why are rows given in reverse order again?
 tutubalin: because bottom is always zero
 tutubalin: things grow up
 Gorbit99: in this case bottom is 14 as I see
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your point of view. at least I had a bug reading the lines in the wrong order at first
 eulerscheZahl: line 14 is the first input line, line 0 is the last
 Andriamanitra: so when i look at the animation what coordinates is top left?
 eulerscheZahl: hover over it
 Andriamanitra: 0,14&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there are tooltips
 Andriamanitra: oh that's handy
 dbdr: euler, don't you think andria is trolling you?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm bad at troll detection
 jrke: top left is 0,14 i think
 jrke: 0,0 is bottom left
 dbdr: the rng ai is suspicious
 Gorbit99: now I have mr "just click on the biggest tile please" working
 eulerscheZahl: of course he isn't serious with it
 eulerscheZahl: but would call it joking, not trolling
 Gorbit99: top 10 boys
 jrke: currently i m just choosing largetst tile 
 dbdr: impressive&#160;:)
 dbdr: I failed at top 10
 eulerscheZahl: that's more than dbdr has working
 Gorbit99: how the hell do you get 440 points more than me jrke
 Gorbit99: I'm also best ruby player and best hungarian
 Gorbit99: although the ruby leaderboard is quite uh... barren
 jrke: and im only and the best indian player&#160;;)
 jrke: in same game
 dbdr: i'm best dbdr
 Gorbit99: but if we do the same thing, then how do you get more points?
 Gorbit99: just blind luck in order?
 jrke: with some random choosing also gorbit if tile no. are equal
 jrke: whats your algo
 Gorbit99: chooses tile closest to top left
 jrke: my algo is bad just pathfinder
 Gorbit99: first horizontally, then vertically
 Andriamanitra: i just passed all the tests so here we go right to the top, probably
 Gorbit99: let me reverse my y a bit
 Gorbit99: sorry jrke, new 9th in town
 Gorbit99: totally planned
 Gorbit99: not just dumb luck
 jrke: np i just worked on it for 15 mins will have to work on it
 jrke: of just 18 points difference
 Andriamanitra: now i just need to keep submitting until the rng trains itself
 jrke: whats the best for horizontal lines i.e. first test case
 Andriamanitra: probably trying to connect all the greens together
 Andriamanitra: since the scoring is (n-2)^2 it will be dominated by the biggest region you can create
 jrke: euler you didn't did search race?
 eulerscheZahl: no jrkedidn't feel like it
 jrke: Response time for first turn ≤ 20s what?
 jrke: 20 seconds
 Gorbit99: 20 second, yep
 Gorbit99: after that you get 50 ms a turn
 Gorbit99: a bit lopsided
 Andriamanitra: who woulda thunk relying on rng would make debugging painful
 Andriamanitra: i can't reproduce bugs :grinning:
 dbdr: use a seed
 Andriamanitra: that's wicked smart
 aCat: Andriamanitra general strategy for SameGame is to avoid merging the color with the largest number of tiles unless it is necessarly to do so
 aCat: as far as thic cat is aware ^^'
 aCat: *this
 aCat: bleh, gotta go swim&#160;;-)
 dbdr: poor cat
 Andriamanitra: i guess i'll keep trying different random seeds until i either reproduce the bug with the test cases or luck my way through the validators
 Andriamanitra: my score is wicked high but i keep failing like one validator
 eulerscheZahl: always the same validator Andriamanitra?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/847363c996b5db478bdbf6bf192c2535825e84">https://www.codingame.com/demo/847363c996b5db478bdbf6bf192c2535825e84</a>
 Gorbit99: well, it's his rng
 jrke: so someone can do hardcoring 
 jrke: but lot of time is needed for that
 Andriamanitra: nope it varies, always one of the standard testset though
 Andriamanitra: just managed to reproduce it for the first time
 eulerscheZahl: hardcoding is easy jrke
 Putnam3145: hardcoding is tedious as hell
 Putnam3145: who has the PATIENCE for that
 eulerscheZahl: how is that tedious? get the validators (accessible), run your code on each of them and store that solution in your code
 eulerscheZahl: i can do that in 15-20min
 jacek: and automate your hardcoding
 Andriamanitra: ok i have absolutely no clue what's going on with my code, it's outputting values that are nowhere to be found
 jacek: ahh the programming
 Andriamanitra: oh right, there was another return statement, now we're cooking with gas
 eulerscheZahl: just don't let it explode
 Gorbit99: how do you get the validators tho?
 Allis: Alternatively, compel it to explode.
 Gorbit99: are they still available in the contrib section?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 jrke: yup
 Gorbit99: nice
 jrke: in accepted
 eulerscheZahl: zip download and playable in the IDE
 Andriamanitra: BOOYAAH straight into the 30k+ range
 eulerscheZahl: well done
 Gorbit99: welp, gonna last for a bit
 Gorbit99: after that it will be max score for everyone
 eulerscheZahl: not max but less fun IMO
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/a-star-craft/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/a-star-craft/leaderboard</a>
 eulerscheZahl: top4, maybe more, are hardcoded
 Illedan: You hardcoded?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. to show neumann how easy it is
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: he spent 2 or 3 days getting the validators and told it's an achievement
 Illedan: Wasn't it 1 week? :P 
 eulerscheZahl: at least a while and a lot of submits
 jrke: oh then if testcases change like in power of thor then?
 eulerscheZahl: while I got all 30 of them in 10min maybe
 Illedan: haha
 eulerscheZahl: now that API has better protection
 jrke: a hardcoded mod&#160;;)
 Illedan: protection or randomness?
 eulerscheZahl: private replays
 Illedan: ah
 eulerscheZahl: still the same validators though
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/A*Craft">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/A*Craft</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that link didn't work well
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: CG failed to parse?
 jrke: so you are simulating with high time in local ide and storing result
 jrke: euler isn't it?
 Gorbit99: well, that makes optimization less fun
 eulerscheZahl: tourist might still have the best A*Craft bot if we would limit everyone to 1s and prevent hardcoding
 dbdr: more fun than random validators
 eulerscheZahl: yes jrke. at least for A*Craft
 Illedan: Will result in a spam fest dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: for code of the ring i did some by hand even
 dbdr: spam?
 Illedan: Spam to have a lucky random
 eulerscheZahl: for the rest I play fair
 Gorbit99: hmm, there needs to be a way to make it consitent, but not hardcoded
 dbdr: random validators, yes. I don't think it's a good solution
 Illedan: Do you include loops in your Code of the ring search euler?
 eulerscheZahl: i create some loops, yes
 eulerscheZahl: but afterwards in post-processing
 Illedan: alright
 eulerscheZahl: why do you care about CotC all of the sudden?
 eulerscheZahl: is it part of the quest map?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Below 6.5 k :P 
 dbdr: Gorbit99, samegame is NP complete. it's not possible to get "max score" even with days/years of CPU
 eulerscheZahl: sounds way easier than 200 for don't panic
 Illedan: But I managed it yesterday with moving around instead of +-
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: 200 is a pain
 Illedan: I have to learn some other language now
 eulerscheZahl: python or ruby
 dbdr: or learn to golf&#160;;)
 Illedan: pfff
 Illedan: Solve the normal puzzle in python, ruby and JS and hope someone pushed a short version :D
 eulerscheZahl: the remaining 2 quests: top2% for optim and golf leaderboard
 dbdr: btw you don't need to learn a language to golf in it
 Gorbit99: oh, it is?
 Gorbit99: then it's kinda nice
 dbdr: I get better scores in languages I don't know
 eulerscheZahl: because they are obscure and others don't know them either
 dbdr: yes, an optim really has to be NP complete to be interesting
 dbdr: not only
 Gorbit99: I barely speak ruby, but I get good scores
 dbdr: all languages have been tried hard by some people
 dbdr: it's also that it's harder to even think of really hacky ways to use a language you use for normal coding
 Illedan: True
 dbdr: your brain shuts the idea down before it's even conscious
 JellyCreeper6: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: and then there are so many dirty things you can do about the validators
 eulerscheZahl: thor goes north now. but you don't have to update the y coordinate
 jrke: there are 50 test cases including validators right?
 dbdr: the dirty tricks is what makes golfing fun
 eulerscheZahl: for Same Game? 10 tests, 40 validators
 eulerscheZahl: that is 20 validators, each of them existing twice
 Illedan: Anyway, of to work. ttyl
 dbdr: have fun&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: my holiday will end soon&#160;:(
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 jrke: can you tell me where is timeout manager is there in same game in refree
 Illedan: I still got 5 more weeks of holiday to enjoy during the rest of the year :tada:
 Gorbit99: I don't understand certain code golfs
 Gorbit99: like thor is currently at 45 chars
 Gorbit99: I take up 2/3s that with input
 eulerscheZahl: i got a parsing error on your question jrke
 dbdr: Illedan how many weeks of holiday a year?
 Illedan: Just 5, but got to bring 2 from last year
 jrke: np i found what i was looking for
 dbdr: ah, nic
 dbdr: e
 Illedan: Will do 1 week on the contest I think
 dbdr: inb4 Illedan #1 in contest
 Illedan:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: inb4 contest delayed till 2021

 AntiSquid: inb4 = in before
 AntiSquid: with all the protests out there i am surprised the number of cases didn't skyrocket
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=inb4">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=inb4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: sounds more reasonable than setting the 0 of our calendar to a birthday of someone 2000 years ago
 dbdr: did you miss the part where it's the 7th of the 5th March?
 AntiSquid: you want multiple official calendars? that's how you get them euler
 dbdr: we already have multiple calendars
 AntiSquid: i know, but not every country needs to acknowledge their existence
 eulerscheZahl: yes I did miss that
 dbdr: yes, there is a dominant one. would be pretty costly to change, for no clear benefit
 AntiSquid: you just need few "my equalitah" protesters and soon you will have to mention date for 5 different calendars to "not discriminate"
 dbdr: there is the CE/BCE, which is smart
 dbdr: not changing the dates
 dbdr: "common era"
 Andriamanitra: i should've stopped trying as soon as i got my stupid rng algorithm working
 Andriamanitra: anything i do just makes it worse
 xlr4829: good morning guys
 dbdr: now do the opposite of what you do
 eulerscheZahl: ah, I only knew the German abbreviation for itn.u.Z = nach unserer Zeitrechnung
 eulerscheZahl: vs v for "vor"
 dbdr: "after our era"?
 AntiSquid: after our calculations
 dbdr: does it start when humanity wipes itself
 dbdr:&#160;?
 dbdr: it's 2020 after our calculations. sounds like you expect some calculation error :D
 AntiSquid: here the meaning is more like "based on" rather than "after an event occured"
 dbdr: looks like the translation of Zeitrechnung is just Calendar
 dbdr: rechnung is invoice :D
 dbdr: time is money
 AntiSquid: oh calculation is Berechnung ... i am getting rusty
 dbdr: the topic of our chat today is "German by dummies"
 AntiSquid: all the million sufixes and prefixes .... 
 dbdr: AntiSquid: rusty is good&#160;;)
 dbdr: (I included myself in the dummies, just to be clear)
 eulerscheZahl: nach can also mean "according", not only "after"
 Gorbit99: oh god no, german
 jacek: :scream:
 dbdr: in french "of after" means according :D
 dbdr: but what is it that it is that this?
 eulerscheZahl: in German the "After" is a part of your body that i'll not further specify
 eulerscheZahl: there are jokes about a no-longer-planet going in that direction
 dbdr: that one is not a no-longer-planet either?
 dbdr: that's behind my knowledge
 AntiSquid: Jupiter no longer a plant, promoted to mini brown dwarf
 AntiSquid:  /Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: see you in the leaderboard
 dbdr: dwarfie promoted to legend

 Westicles: Samegame again, ugh
 dbdr: again?
 Westicles: There was a contest a few years ago... looks like I am down to 4th on the JS-Games site
 dbdr: what's your name there?
 Westicles: sampson
 eulerscheZahl: you are about 650 point above me on the testcase I just shared
 eulerscheZahl: time to take a screenshot before you ruin it :rofl:
 Westicles: Are the validators different than the standard test cases?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: there are the 20 ones you know
 eulerscheZahl: then the same 20 again with colors shuffled
 Westicles: So you can do them offline and hardcode?
 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: my current score is without hardcoding. but because of double validators it's about 37k
 eulerscheZahl: which is really low looking at the jsgames scores
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles how did you submit your scores on the jsgames website? clicking by hand or anything smarter?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, they have sokoban too. I made a solver for that game a while ago.let it run for an afternoon, still rank 85 on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/eulerschezahl">https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/eulerschezahl</a>
 Westicles: Yeah, it was by hand.  But that was back in 2012, maybe it has some kind of submission option now
 Angecide: hi where can i read about how much time there is between each turns in bot programming? I think the time is different between first and second rounds and so on, but I am not entirely sure how much
 AntiSquid: bottom of the statement Angecide
 Angecide: oh snap, you are right haha
 Illedan: Oh, new Optim :o
 eulerscheZahl: not for you
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Illedan: Not fun?
 eulerscheZahl: you are dangerous for my ranking
 Illedan: You already have a long headstart
 Illedan: But I have the night off. :smiling_imp:
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: did you get your screenshot?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just floating around
 eulerscheZahl: no, didn't take one
 Illedan: dbdr beat him already? :P 
 eulerscheZahl: are you about to beat me now?
 dbdr: hurry up&#160;;)
 Illedan: Offline search?
 dbdr: of course
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 Illedan: Such cheat, much ok
 dbdr: embrace it
 Illedan: Validators in the repo I guess?
 dbdr: i guess it's easier not to do it to have an excuse not to win&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and visible in the contribution itself
 dbdr: in the contrib
 eulerscheZahl: for download in the zip. i don't think there is a repo for it
 dbdr: I did not find any repo
 Illedan: Found it
 Illedan: Let the games begin
 Illedan: nanana
 eulerscheZahl: batman
 Illedan: should get back to work though
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/8hdSy1.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/8hdSy1.jpg</a> for eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: so you are about to submit
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: :fire:
 eulerscheZahl: what score can you achieve online?
 dbdr: 20
 dbdr: in bash
 eulerscheZahl: i could easily increase my score too when running offline. just seems boring and not who the game is meant to me played
 dbdr: who decides how it's meant to be played?
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: :god:
 eulerscheZahl: acat who doubled the validators :D
 dbdr: i'm sure you could increase it
 dbdr: there is a :god: icon? :D
 dbdr: ah no
 eulerscheZahl: you shall not make a picture of god
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 jrke: dbdr is your bot in same game hardcoded?
 dbdr: offline search
 eulerscheZahl: even for the 61k?
 dbdr: well, that was one run at 20s, with no tuning
 eulerscheZahl: ah, your submit just updated
 Illedan: :rocket:
 eulerscheZahl: so far the score isn't any shocking
 dbdr: nope
 dbdr: I'm sure we'll see 100K before too long
 jrke: suppose you stored solution but how you check which is for current   test case
 dbdr: match statement
 jrke: ok
 Illedan: I like this puzzle, will give it a serious try after work&#160;:)
 Illedan: Offline ofc
 dbdr: game is on&#160;:)
 Illedan: You bet
 jrke: is this not cheating&#160;?
 dbdr: not if everyone can do it easily
 Illedan: Wanna bet about it dbdr? 
 eulerscheZahl: everyone can do it. still feels lame to me
 jrke: ok
 dbdr: bet what?
 eulerscheZahl: so i'll join the offline club soon
 eulerscheZahl: 100k score bot
 eulerscheZahl: bet
 Illedan: On who is first on SameGame by the end of Sunday
 MSmits: I'm coding too, but it's gonna take a while
 dbdr: :D
 Illedan: Loser has to add a bio for a week of the winner
 MSmits: jacek said meta mcts so...
 dbdr: well, we can make a minicontest
 jrke: yeah
 MSmits: don't really need a timelimit tbh
 Illedan: I love timelimits
 Illedan: :P
 jrke: lest make mini constest 5 days from now same game&#160;;)
 dbdr: deadline makes it more intense
 MSmits: sure
 jrke: yeah
 Illedan: And I can timebox it
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: time box?
 dbdr: like a lunchbox, but for time
 Illedan: lol
 MSmits: o that explains everything
 dbdr: yw
 jrke: i will start it from tommorow
 MSmits: why put it off, do it now jrke
 MSmits: go go
 dbdr: start yesterday
 jrke: busy in school hw&#160;:(
 dbdr: gotta sort out your priorities
 MSmits: my school starts next week so I am ok
 jrke: but from tomorrow i will have 4 days will work on it
 dbdr: so sunday 8 pm end of contest?
 dbdr: when is euler's bedtime?
 eulerscheZahl: 8pm is fine
 Illedan: 8 pm GMT+0
 eulerscheZahl: i'll be around for the end
 Illedan: It's on
 jrke: i have doubt in input of same game
 jrke: 8pm time for which country?
 Illedan: GMT+0
 dbdr: UTC
 jrke: Ok
 dbdr: GMT is dead
 Illedan: lol
 eulerscheZahl: GMT? greenwich mean time?
 Illedan: Yeah
 jrke: yeah Greenwich meantime 
 dbdr: you see, eulerscheZahl is too young to even know it
 Illedan: hshs
 Illedan: haha
 jrke: india is GMT+5:30 means i will be sleeping at that time :stuck_out_tongue:
 eulerscheZahl: i never know the timezone CG is using to announce a contest
 eulerscheZahl: EST or whatever that is
 dbdr: sleeping is not recommended during contests
 dbdr: isn't CG usually using CET?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 jrke: suppose i=0 and j=0 in input so it will be top left or bottom left
 jrke: in same game
 dbdr: check the tooltips
 dbdr: or the statement if you are brave&#160;;)
 Illedan: 39k on my stupid greedy&#160;:) 
 dbdr: apparently you're working hard :D
 Illedan: :angel:
 Frosty8529: How do I get CodinPoints?
 eulerscheZahl: employee of the month
 dbdr: that's how you get codingpoints? :D
 dbdr: i've been doing it all wrong
 Frosty8529: I'm just a first year in college so I'm not doing any jobs&#160;;-;
 Illedan: Just play games and puzzles
 Frosty8529: rip codinpoints
 Illedan: And the points will come naturally
 Frosty8529: oh
 Illedan: On CodinGame 
 Illedan: Multiplayer is the easiest.
 Illedan: And most fun
 Frosty8529: you mean the compete mode?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: Why did aCat just double the testcases -.-
 Illedan: meh
 Frosty8529: I want to get better before entering one
 Illedan: Only need to solve half of them
 Illedan: You get better by entering one
 Frosty8529: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: i was arguing against exactly that decision Illedan, stopped me from approving
 eulerscheZahl: his arguements: 40 validators is better than 20 (which is proven wrong with hardcoding in identical ones)
 eulerscheZahl: and common testsets are better than new, random ones as we can compare them with literature
 AntiSquid: how come trolls vs castles isn't approved?
 eulerscheZahl: does it deserve to be approved?
 eulerscheZahl: also isn't it still WIP?
 AntiSquid: personally i don't like it but considering the other stuff that got approved ...
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see the point of the game, feels way too random for me
 AntiSquid: 110 score
 eulerscheZahl: where? what?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: it can be studied, it's not random
 eulerscheZahl: i know about markov chain and nash equilibrium
 dbdr: though I did not follow how it evolved, just speaking about the base concept
 Illedan: Westicles hardcoding? 15% and 22k :O
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/eng/highscores/samegame/lx">http://www.js-games.de/eng/highscores/samegame/lx</a>
 eulerscheZahl: westicles = sampson
 dbdr: right, so he has a huge headstart :D
 eulerscheZahl: you have to double the scores to get CG scores
 eulerscheZahl: as the cat doubled the validators
 Illedan: He just copied those maps?
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: but why
 jacek: same validators
 jacek: as same game
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Illedan: ..
 eulerscheZahl: he changed the coloring
 eulerscheZahl: but still the same, as the same click order gives the same score
 dbdr: so 173K incoming?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: get rekt
 dbdr: :D
 Marchete: validators are public and fixed?
 dbdr: banned from the contes
 dbdr: t
 eulerscheZahl: yes and yes
 dbdr: yes
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 croxvore: :grimacing:
 Marchete: :unamused:
 Westicles: oh, hey good news I don't think I have those old solutions any more
 AntiSquid: get an avatar ^
 Illedan: Let's try to beat him anyway :eyes:
 dbdr: random validators are bad anyways
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: They could instead just make validators a seed :P
 dbdr: unless it's a trick&#160;;)
 Illedan: And hide the contri
 dbdr: you can always extract them
 dbdr: just makes it harder, so potentially less people have them
 Illedan: How?
 dbdr: =&gt; more unfair
 dbdr: bit by bit
 AntiSquid: he will undergo hypno therapy to remember how he solved it last time
 Illedan: yeah, go full Neumann on it :P
 dbdr: ping =&gt; one more contestant now&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: do you still have the solver code Westicles?
 Westicles: yep
 Illedan: I'll add a discord channel for the minicontest :D
 AntiSquid: what contest? 
 eulerscheZahl: sounds overkill
 Illedan: naah
 eulerscheZahl: "contest"
 dbdr: why not just flood #world&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes ^
 dbdr: forum post might be good though
 eulerscheZahl: just don't rearrange the order of channels Illedan
 dbdr: y not?
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: Wonder who did that
 Illedan: dbdr, make the forum post
 eulerscheZahl: he confessed already
 Illedan: I'll make the Discord stuff
 Illedan: Who was it?
 eulerscheZahl: the forum post already exists
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: haha
 dbdr: that's good, I felt lazy
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: hah
 Illedan: høh
 dbdr: i
 dbdr: (in french)
 Marchete: dbdr what's your approach for SameGame, something like NumberShifting or just MCTS?
 dbdr: jacek :unamused:
 jacek: he uses jacek for samegame
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: JCTS
 Marchete: :D
 dbdr: JCKS?
 Marchete: JACEK, another new acronym I need to learn...
 dbdr: Just
 dbdr: Another
 dbdr: Crazy
 Marchete: Elephant
 Marchete: Korean
 dbdr: ^
 eulerscheZahl: got your screenshot dbdr?
 dbdr: it's your job
 dbdr: respect the new tradition
 Marchete: I can't see how MCTS can be good
 eulerscheZahl: good thing it's only 1 keystroke away
 dbdr: arf, optimized for 100K milesone
 dbdr: gz
 Marchete: any little change can make huge changes on the outcome
 eulerscheZahl: coincidence
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/bwjSY28">https://imgur.com/a/bwjSY28</a>
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's beam search
 eulerscheZahl: but still far away from top players on that other website
 Marchete: I think i'd go with some SA variant
 Marchete: and restart each N secs
 Marchete: but I need bacon
 Marchete: to cook it while I fry again the CPU with stupid long calculations
 jacek: yeah, cancer research and stuff
 jacek: right?
 Marchete: "stupid long calculations"
 Marchete: i.e. numbershifting v2.0
 eulerscheZahl: sounds all like number shif...
 eulerscheZahl: yes that
 Illedan: My new kitchen will have owens powered by CPU usage.. Cheaper this way
 darkhorse64: Cooking may be too ambitious. Target central heating
 Illedan: In comming news:Global Warming, now powered by SameGame!
 eulerscheZahl: the heating also has less peaks
 zlatanised: godzilla
 jacek: jesuszilla?
 dbdr: Al-Massih
 Lusher: hi
 Lusher: Can I ask help&#160;?
 jacek: I permit
 Lusher: ho
 Lusher: noice
 Lusher: I resolve a code
 Lusher: all tests are perfects
 Lusher: but I have only 73%, I don't know what did I bad
 Lusher: soeey my english is not perfect&#160;:/
 jacek: validation tests and test cases are different to avoid hardcoding solution
 Lusher: yes
 jacek: maybe your code isnt correct
 Lusher: i think
 PurCHES5: Lusher it means there are something wrong in your code but the test cases cannot detect. You may try to check your code again and do more testings
 Lusher: Yeah, I did it but I didn't see my error... I use python tutor too for test my code too
 jrke: euler are you targeting 1,000,000 points for same game
 PurCHES5: maybe just leave it and later you may find other solutions
 PurCHES5: bonne chance
 Lusher: ty
 jrke: i found bug in the game
 jrke: The game has crashed. Please contact the author and enclose the following error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/77725630-3b85-4aca-9e35-4084727a6528">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/77725630-3b85-4aca-9e35-4084727a6528</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure 1 million is impossible
 jrke: if you didn't give spaces between x y co-ordinates
 eulerscheZahl: probably even 200k is out of range
 eulerscheZahl: tell aCat
 jrke: lemme comment in contribution
 jrke: sorry gorbit just 5 min gave me 10000+ points&#160;;)
 jrke: gorbit99*
 jrke: eulerscheZahl watch points rank 19 in same game 92,910 but 55%
 Gorbit99: yeah, haven't touched the puzzle since
 MSmits: yay 100% 
 MSmits: I won samegame :P
 dbdr: :bow:
 kovi: duh, another optim
 MSmits: now to do better than random bot :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: and it's an optim I'm actually interested in
 MSmits: sims like these make my head hurt
 dbdr: how it is different from others?
 MSmits: i dunno, the shifting of rows and columns, i keep making bugs :P
 dbdr: did you optimize it to death?&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe it;s worse because of the semi-bitboard I have got going on
 MSmits: semi-optimized yes
 dbdr: half-death
 kovi: well, for the interest is the algoif it is pure sa than not my fav
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: I'm gonna go with mcts
 MSmits: dunno why it would be SA
 Memo12334: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1042c706-686d-4306-9cf7-0841afd920d7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1042c706-686d-4306-9cf7-0841afd920d7</a>
 Westicles: What's the longest too fast timeout?
 kovi: i read above sa and beam
 kovi: dont even know the rules yet
 Memo12334: yall know this pikapcha ep 2 , there should be another way of doing if elses right?
 MSmits: they only just started, it's new. People try stuff
 dbdr: rules are for the weak
 MSmits: beamsearch makes sense
 kovi: yeah, i like the norule optim
 dbdr: submit your score
 MSmits: the timing is weird
 MSmits: 20 s first turn, then 1/400 of that in the next turns
 MSmits: basically you have to retain your search tree from turn 1 or you lose a lot
 DomiKo: the first idea was only 20s
 DomiKo: and then 0s
 DomiKo: you have to do everything in one turn
 MSmits: yeah thats kinda annoying because it requires perfect sim
 dbdr: you plan to have bugs?&#160;;)
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: 11898 on offline runner. 10889 and 87&#160;% online -.-
 MSmits: nah dbdr I was more talking about beginners. You dont want to force them to have a perfect sim right at the start i think
 DomiKo: 50ms is not enough?
 MSmits: it's fine, it doesnt matter as long as there's enough time to read input
 MSmits: and output something
 MSmits: it's just weird compared to the 20s at the start
 MSmits: but I get the reasons
 philRG: nicola
 Illedan: :tada:
 MSmits: gj&#160;:)
 Illedan: 100&#160;% equal offline vs online
 Illedan: let the games begin
 Illedan: ^^
 aCat: MSmits i was forced to add turns&#160;;/
 aCat: to make it noob friendly
 Illedan: I find it ok&#160;:)
 MSmits: i know acat, its fine
 MSmits: its just weird
 aCat: it should be one-turn puzzle
 aCat: forgive this cat ^^'
 MSmits: cat is forgiven
 aCat: :joy_cat:
 Illedan: Online IDE doesn't like my 1 long string of hardcoded moves :D
 MSmits: it doesnt no
 MSmits: ohh you get 0 points for a  2 tile 
 MSmits: no wonder i would crash, it's not larger than 0
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: 50k rollouts in 10 sec :snail:&#160;:(
 MSmits: ah well
 MSmits: let it run for longer
 Illedan: Debug mode. Not optimal impl
 Illedan: Full MC now
 MSmits: i am almost done with full MC
 MSmits: I am not saving tree yet though
 MSmits: so it's just 50 ms most turns
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: almost 50k&#160;:)&#160;:)
 MSmits: me happy
 MSmits: i should check my rollout count
 Illedan: 42k points. Stuff is working. Now optimization and better search
 MSmits: 85k full rollouts in 20 seconds
 MSmits: so it's slower than yours
 MSmits: i guess the testset matters
 MSmits: this was on 20
 DomiKo: yes it matters
 MSmits: gonna try and get a mcts working today
 MSmits: will do everything online first
 DomiKo: but with full MC i can get 140K in 20s on testcase 20
 DomiKo: and my score is lower...
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: how do you define a rollout?
 DomiKo: whole simulation of one game
 MSmits: ah ok same here
 MSmits: so that means floodfilling everything?
 MSmits: or do you select a random tile/.
 MSmits: and then flood fill
 MSmits: I floodfill everything, make a list of tiles for each floodfill,, then select one of those randomly
 MSmits: if you're just selecting random tiles, it might be a lot faster
 DomiKo: i select random legal tile
 MSmits: thats why your score is lower
 MSmits: and why you are faster
 DomiKo: you are right
 MSmits: you're faster because you dont need to flood fill everything
 MSmits: and your score is lower because you have a larger chance of picking large floods
 DomiKo: and that larger chance isn't cool
 MSmits: right
 DomiKo: i will fix that
 MSmits: because you need to collect large floods without picking them
 MSmits: I'm hyped for this multi
 MSmits: err optim
 MSmits: it's fun
 MSmits: getting numbershifting vibes
 ZistyE: l
 eulerscheZahl: so, Westicles finally submitted a 100% solution
 eulerscheZahl: looks tough to get there
 Illedan: :o
 Illedan: Daym
 MSmits: 100% as in the board is empty?
 eulerscheZahl: 100% correctness
 Illedan: He is 1st on the leadboard
 Illedan: and 100% testcase solved
 eulerscheZahl: but i suppose all boards cleared too
 Westicles: heh heh.
 MSmits: how do you know it's 100% correctness
 Illedan: Is it possible to clear all boards?
 MSmits: :confused:
 Westicles: Yeah, you can clear them all
 aCat: you always have 100% if youre not crashing
 aCat: you can clean probably
 MSmits: right aCat thats what i was thinking
 aCat: but thtat is noe an endgame&#160;;]
 aCat: cause it may be even more benficial to not clear it
 MSmits: makes sense
 aCat: not sure on that but yeah, 
 Illedan: might be
 aCat: score grows fast when you're able to gather same colors
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68239a9e-1fff-4a6a-b9f2-6767fb8a6ee9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68239a9e-1fff-4a6a-b9f2-6767fb8a6ee9</a>
 eulerscheZahl: + is cleared, - is not
 MSmits: oh, nice
 MSmits: i was confused by your math 
 aCat: This will be probably firs/second task for the course ^^'
 MSmits: but then i realized the weird *2 modifier
 aCat: now I'm glad you are all having fun
 MSmits: sure
 aCat: but need to go code other puzzles :D
 eulerscheZahl: except for you. will you join?
 aCat: nope
 MSmits: aww
 MSmits: just submit a simple bot
 eulerscheZahl: he did
 eulerscheZahl: 38k
 MSmits: oh ok
 aCat: xp/cp wise I should other things
 MSmits: who cares about that
 aCat: teaching-wise other
 Illedan: Only solving 20 euler and finding equal puzzles?
 aCat: and work-wise even outside cg
 MSmits: oh, you dont want your students to be ahead of you?
 eulerscheZahl: yes Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: everything else would be waste of CPU time
 Illedan: I should do that too. Halves the runtime
 Illedan: :D
 aCat: If I have lectures prepared on things I have to do I will do some coding here for sure
 MSmits: Illedan, make your own colors
 MSmits: first color that appears = 0
 MSmits: second = 1
 Illedan: Yeah, I know
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/512ea06c-1ec6-4ec8-96cd-a9badc266d5c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/512ea06c-1ec6-4ec8-96cd-a9badc266d5c</a>
 Illedan: Just had a very naive input reading
 eulerscheZahl: that gives the same score for swapped colors
 eulerscheZahl: in theory it might consider some boards the same that are not. but not a problem for the given testcases
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: sweet
 Illedan: ty
 MSmits: I'm probably just gonna put some giant strings in there :P
 Illedan: I have that now
 eulerscheZahl: i have too
 eulerscheZahl: and a solver that i outcomment with #id DEBUG
 eulerscheZahl: if, not id
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise i would easily risk losing the solver. my disk is a mess
 MSmits: hmm i dont get it
 MSmits: why would you lose it?
 eulerscheZahl: i mean it's easier for me to find the code on the CG website than in my local folder structure
 Gorbit99: unorganized stuff?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Illedan: I'm currently pushing my SameGame code in my OOC repo :D
 eulerscheZahl: that makes absolutely no sense
 Gorbit99: on linux I just do sudo find / -name thing
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is on linux</b></p><p><img src="/a/16222515698472" /> Illedan: Where I have my bot code for ooc
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Just the last repo I made for CG
 Gorbit99: eulerscheZahl can also use that and save a heck ton of time
 Illedan: feels better to put it on GiT
 Neumann: Illedan, eulerscheZahl&#160;: late reaction, but at least my way of reversing the validators is fun and rewarding
 Neumann: You trolls
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i do pro-level validator reversal
 Illedan: I would say your way is more impressive :P
 eulerscheZahl: and somehow i'm missing some avatars
 eulerscheZahl: like Neumann and smits
 Illedan: Anyway, you joining for a small contest on SameGame Neumann?
 Neumann: What's that
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/samegame">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/samegame</a>
 Neumann: Hum, let me check my empty agenda
 Neumann: Maybe
 Illedan: Deadline on Sunday 8 PM UTC
 Neumann: Where does it say so
 Illedan: We set a theoretical deadline :P 
 Illedan: And I wrote on on General on Discord
 Neumann: I'll never have enough CPU-time to win this
 Neumann: I need 2 months
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: more precisely: Illedan decidedi'm just playing the game for fun
 eulerscheZahl: i think i need a different scoring
 MSmits: the best score = "more points is better"
 MSmits: scoring
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, i'll try that
 MSmits: it will help, I promise
 Lachrymosa: Good Morning
 ZahidHussain: hy
 eulerscheZahl: good evening Lachrymosa. you aren't in Germany anmore?
 Lachrymosa: No, I've moved back to the US for the foreseeable future

 Illedan: Damn, had to resubmit 10 multies -.-First time I checked through all since C# update :P
 MSmits: wow
 Illedan: 71k :tada:
 MSmits: do I need to do this too on some multis? I am guessing it's just C# fancy features
 eulerscheZahl: the marchete pragma?
 MSmits: oh that weird restart thing"?
 Illedan: Yeah
 MSmits: dunno if I have it submitted anywhere
 MSmits: maybe locam
 eulerscheZahl: i had a few bots drawing bitmaps
 dbdr: gogogo #4 Illedan&#160;;)
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 dbdr:&#160;?
 Illedan: 20 min run and I had a bug in my new save method. Making me loose that new score -.-
 dbdr: ouch
 eulerscheZahl: how high was it?
 Illedan: Just 74k :P
 dbdr: always test with a short run first
 Illedan: But 3rd!
 AntiSquid: chat lagging for anyone else?
 dbdr: I also print the moves on stdout just in case
 kovi: 20min/local? is it so easy to obtain testcases?&#160;:(
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Ofc
 eulerscheZahl: very helpful
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52286850570a02e25f12d5b1b9a30bdb954c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52286850570a02e25f12d5b1b9a30bdb954c</a>
 Illedan: It's CG, not fort knox
 eulerscheZahl: zip download + IDE access
 eulerscheZahl: top3 is hardcoded now. i was at 74k within the 20s limit
 eulerscheZahl: but improved my solver since
 kovi: oh well. thought i will have fun for the weekend after 3 month of no coding
 Illedan: I find offline solving fun too
 MSmits: why not have fun?
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: doing it online for now though
 eulerscheZahl: i'm with kovi: more fun without the hardcoding
 eulerscheZahl: but no way to be competitive if you don't hardcode and others do&#160;:(
 MSmits: depends on the algorithms too though
 eulerscheZahl: would need something absolutely brilliant
 MSmits: allright, will submit soon :P
 dbdr: inb4 MSmits #2
 Illedan: score?
 MSmits: no idea Illedan. i am solving online
 MSmits: I will know when i submit, it's a mcts
 Illedan: k
 eulerscheZahl: of course it is
 dbdr: that's the fun part: your score is a surprise :D
 MSmits: tuning the exploration parameter a bit first, it's a bit weird. Never done a  1p mcts before
 MSmits: also i am using highest score as value, might need an average score instead
 dbdr: though it's also a nice surprise when you break a record offline
 dbdr: it's all fun, happy happy
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like dbdr is up to something
 dbdr: why cannot you believe I enjoy the game without a hidden reason?&#160;;)
 MSmits: hmm i can see another reason to solve offline
 eulerscheZahl: emojinalysis
 Illedan: CG submit limit?
 dbdr: I mean W is high enough and had such a headstart that I don't feel much pressure&#160;:)
 MSmits: you can pick your best result. If I submit it might have some validators lower than usual and others higher
 dbdr: sure
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: Sooo, I should save scores for each testcase on it's own
 dbdr: NEW RECORD: 2085 =&gt; 2089you see, such a nice surprise :D
 Illedan: and pick the best
 Illedan: :rocket:
 MSmits: of course
 eulerscheZahl: my total is 126408
 eulerscheZahl: not making much progress anymore
 eulerscheZahl: won't even submit
 MSmits: failed 4 tests and have 49576 points
 MSmits: no idea why i fail them
 Illedan: #NoSleepBefore2nd
 MSmits: 6 tests even
 Illedan: Auch
 MSmits: mmh maybe i run out of nodepool
 Illedan: No replay on optims
 dbdr: gz Illedan on #4
 dbdr: you can retire now&#160;;)
 Illedan: nah
 Illedan: I'll grab a shower and get back to my awesome results after this next run. brb
 dbdr: need to get that 100K badge?
 Illedan: 100k?
 dbdr: score
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: Ez
 Illedan: 101,239 and I'm happy
 dbdr: :P
 Illedan: ^^
 kovi: dbdr already has 103.427
 kovi: locally
 dbdr: why that number? :D
 Illedan: *103.428 then
 eulerscheZahl: why is your number odd Illedan?
 Illedan: can't it be?
 eulerscheZahl: makes no sense with duplicated validators
 eulerscheZahl: noob
 dbdr: it's me + 1
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl
 Illedan: stop thinking this much
 eulerscheZahl: ok, good night
 Illedan: nooo
 MSmits: gn euler
 dbdr: dream in 5 colors
 MSmits: weird, i succeed on all testcases in IDE, but fail on 4 validators
 MSmits: I fail on 8. 11 and on 18 I fail on both versions
 MSmits: maybe it happens when I empty the board
 aCat: hmm
 aCat: sensing some empty action maybe?
 aCat: no idea, should work the same
 MSmits: maybe i print too much error
 MSmits: i usually print a line for each possible move
 aCat: oO
 MSmits: nope didnt help. I also fail on different test cases each time
 darkhorse64: 56k with a MonteCarlo
 MSmits: got 49 with monte carlo myself, but tried only once
 darkhorse64: C++; STC code reuse; not using the 50 ms
 MSmits: nice
 AntiSquid: why not?
 Astrobytes: Presumably because 20s was enough?
 darkhorse64: My previous score was using aCat Java bot; C++gives a nice boost. I am not using the 50 ms for now as a first try
 darkhorse64: 50ms should not make a big difference
 darkhorse64: The boost comes also from a improved BFS and stacking algo
 dbdr: what's acat java bot?
 darkhorse64: From the contribution
 Astrobytes: guessing just from the contrib
 dbdr: I though only puzzles needed solutions
 Astrobytes: Not a solution, he just means the game code
 aCat: it's basic flatmc
 darkhorse64: There were several bots included
 aCat: unoptimized java 
 aCat: I advise you to use PlayerError :D
 Astrobytes: There were? I downloaded but didn't even look lol
 Astrobytes: aCat isn't all java unoptimised? :P
 aCat: true that&#160;;]
 dbdr: that's cheap&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: It's a nice starting point anyway. Before smart algos, you need an engine
 aCat: you want a c++ implementation&#160;:&gt;?
 dbdr: aCat Consulting Group
 Astrobytes: Yes. Please include one with all your future contributions :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 darkhorse64: I have one now 
 MSmits: it sounds great, but I can never read other people's c++
 Astrobytes: I'll start properly tomorrow, busy day today, got some time off tomorrow
 aCat: BTW you use normal sims?
 dbdr: can you read your own C++?
 aCat: or with the Tristan's proposed heuristic?
 MSmits: I can usually read it :P
 aCat: It's not my c++ ;p
 darkhorse64: "normal sims"&#160;? Fully random playouts&#160;?
 aCat: yep
 aCat: ehh
 MSmits: what is this heuristic?
 darkhorse64: Yes. Tabu is next
 aCat: maybe I read a little too much papers on this
 aCat: heh&#160;;]
 MSmits: and who is Tabu?
 aCat: someone make their classes&#160;;]
 dbdr: Tabu is taboo
 Astrobytes: MSmits do some reading darn it
 MSmits: o
 aCat: ^^'
 MSmits: reading&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: You like writing, reading is mandatory
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Astrobytes: Seriously tho, you never came across tabu search so far?
 MSmits: nope
 darkhorse64: Same for me before the optim appeared
 MSmits: ahh finally 100% I think I had a backpropagation bug. Only 52k points though
 MSmits: I think  i need to use average score
 MSmits: and store the best results as opposed to just using the tree result
 MSmits: if I get a good random rollout result I should store it
 Memo12334: guys im sorry for disturbing but this ep2 challenge killed me. I tried to do it without hardcoding everything aka doing it with rotations but im lost. May I ask if anyone can take a look at my code and help. I ask with shame
 aCat: no shame in programming :D
 aCat: it's normal its not working
 Memo12334: idk what im doing anymore
 Memo12334: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3a145b5-85c4-4d56-908c-1eee98a3cc68">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3a145b5-85c4-4d56-908c-1eee98a3cc68</a>
 Memo12334: btw
 Memo12334: sry Meneer Smits but I am bad
 Astrobytes: You've been promoted to Sir MSmits!
 Memo12334: dat translate
 Memo12334: the M in Smits is for meneer aka sir I assumed
 Astrobytes: His initial I do believe&#160;;)
 AlexMercan: why include &lt;iterator&gt;
 MSmits: huh
 Astrobytes: So you can use iterator
 MSmits: my students call me meneer Smits
 Memo12334: bruh AlexMercan
 MSmits: wait I forgot, Memo12334 are you one of my students? I just see Netherlands
 AlexMercan: You don't need &lt;iterator&gt; to use iterators tho
 darkhorse64: For this puzzle, I used a more complex data structure where each cell store its 4 neighbours (or less to account for borders). This makes moving and pathfinding a lot simpler
 Memo12334: sry I can't dox my self because im failing in pikaptcha ep2
 Memo12334: and then u will talk about how bad I am in the teachersroom (lerarenkamer)
 MSmits: nah
 Astrobytes: Sounds like one of yours MSmits :P
 MSmits: most students I teach arent good enough to even try these puzzles Memo12334
 MSmits: pikaptcha 2 is pretty hard for a beginner
 Memo12334: jk , im 21 
 Memo12334: yes it is , I asked someone how can I code it without spamming if else and he said rotations
 MSmits: Memo12334 it might be worth to take one step back and find a BFS tutorial for beginners. 
 Astrobytes: (also joking, I knew he was older)
 MSmits: did you ever use BFS?
 Memo12334: nope , I Never looked at any algorithms at all tbh 
 Astrobytes: You're gonna find pathfinding algorithms *really* useful on CG
 MSmits: BFS is basically the easiest pathfinding algorithm. Now, you dont really use BFS here, because moves are decided by the wall, but  practicing BFS in a maze gets you used to move generation and such
 Memo12334: a guy said there are no tricks involved in pikaptcha ep 2 so I just tried
 Memo12334: I will gather resources on that, good to know
 MSmits: basically what I did was give each direction a number 0, 1, 2, 3
 MSmits: if the change in direction is right, then I will increment, otherwise i will decrement
 MSmits: when it becomes 4, it becomes 0
 MSmits: and -1 becomes 3
 Memo12334: u didn't do anything with rotations so?
 MSmits: so you hit the wall, increment to right, still a wall?  increment again, still a wall? increment again,
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, you're C++ skid
 Astrobytes: On discord
 Memo12334: gg doxed
 Astrobytes: Robo suggested rotating the direction vector
 MSmits: Memo12334 well not really, it's just a number that means a direction
 MSmits: so 0 could be up, 1 could be right, 2 could be down, 3 could be left
 Astrobytes: From discord: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/548e8bb8-37cc-4484-b0c0-1f59658a9da1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/548e8bb8-37cc-4484-b0c0-1f59658a9da1</a>
 MSmits: so first you check if you can move, if not, do the direction change however many times until you can move
 MSmits: then move in that direction
 MSmits: and do it again
 MSmits: all the way until you hit start tile
 Memo12334: ye I know what rotation is and how to do rotate aka x = -y and y = x but I just iddn't get it. MSmits what if it hits a walll, it goes anywhere?
 MSmits: no dont do that
 MSmits: dont do the rotation matrix crap
 MSmits: who needs that
 Astrobytes: Robo
 MSmits: just have a single number for a direction
 MSmits: and 4 possible directions
 MSmits: then some if elses
 MSmits: if(direction == 0), y = y - 1
 MSmits: else if (direction == 1) x = x+ 1
 kovi: oh, illedan...
 MSmits: etc
 Memo12334: but thats a lot of if else
 MSmits: just 4
 Astrobytes: Isn't that what you had already Memo12334?
 Memo12334: yes ;p but after the first if I coded I thought I had to code too much if and else it would be a bad solution
 MSmits: its less than 5 min of coding for a puzzle you've been stuck on for days
 Memo12334: *cries*
 MSmits: first make it work
 MSmits: then make it pretty
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: This 100%
 MSmits: or never make it pretty, who cares :P
 Illedan: Pretty?
 MSmits: Memo12334 I've done a bot contest where I had over 300 times the word "if" in my bot
 Illedan: Rookies numbers
 Memo12334: wth
 Astrobytes: Like the Enigma puzzle, just get it working and work on different methods later
 Memo12334: is that how old skool AI is done 
 darkhorse64: You should really study BFS algo and companion data structures, they are ubiquitous at CG.
 Illedan: Ah, kovi joined too :D
 Illedan: Offline?
 kovi: never
 MSmits: Memo12334  nope, it just depends on the arena. 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-a-la-mode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-a-la-mode</a>
 MSmits: this one i had 300 ifs in
 MSmits: 3k lines of code :P
 dbdr: what about NS kovi?
 kovi: i knew that is coming
 dbdr: never say never&#160;;)
 Memo12334: that's pretty bruh
 Illedan: NS is designed to be offline tj
 Illedan: though
 MSmits: well it took 10 days of heavy coding, so it's not like i did that in an afternoon
 Illedan: Wow, I'm wood2 on calm :D
 Astrobytes: Wood 2? How did that happen?
 MSmits: start cookin'
 Illedan: I was a tester and got sick of the game :P
 Astrobytes: Ah OK. Too much food.
 MSmits: he just makes a crappy blueberry pie
 Astrobytes: Eugh. Still have nightmares about that game lol
 MSmits: I had fun except when people didn't take my plate :rage:
 LEO_000_001: which game?
 Illedan: Code a la mode
 LEO_000_001: hahaha a French name 
 Astrobytes: Hopefully csj learned his lesson after BitRunner and will make a more search-friendly game next time :P
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: :pray:
 darkhorse64: csj = Code Royale, no&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Aye, and Code a la Mode
 MSmits: didnt those games get made by teams of 3 players?
 Astrobytes: Yeah but they were csj's games
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Where is he anyway, didn't see him around for ages. Think the last time was when he streamed some CoC or something ages ago
 JBM: even he fell to coc
 Astrobytes: The harder they come, the harder they fall
 Memo12334: MSmits what about the R and L u get from string side? which wall to follow
 darkhorse64: Code a La Mode was a good game by itself and also because it is quite different from other multis (coop, no search) 
 JBM: there's always search if you really want to find it
 MSmits: Memo12334, you have to define directions 0,1,2,3
 MSmits: R could be increasing the number
 MSmits: L could be decreasing
 Astrobytes: Yeah definitely was darkhorse64, hard to enforce the cooperation part though so it kinda got lost
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4d5f46a3-5211-476c-b675-7edb6a230261">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4d5f46a3-5211-476c-b675-7edb6a230261</a>
 MSmits: damnit
 MSmits: i did the numbers wrong lol
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/78d649d7-248a-420b-83e0-b9503969de31">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/78d649d7-248a-420b-83e0-b9503969de31</a>
 Memo12334:  An additional character indicates which wall Pikaptcha must follow:
 darkhorse64: I mean, sim is not needed for Legend. Yes, coop was difficult to implement
 MSmits: yes Memo12334, if at the start you get  "R", then you always increase the number when you hit the wall
 darkhorse64: You had to make your code quite resilient to bad manners
 MSmits: if at the start you get L, then you always decrease the number
 MSmits: of course making sure that when you go over 3 it becomes 0 and such
 Memo12334: hmm ok ty
 MSmits: np good luck
 MSmits: use a lot of error messages to get feedback about what your algo is doing
 AntiSquid: fell to coc? what?
 AntiSquid: oh chat scroll
 JBM: :p
 MSmits: yay finally 100% again. I had a really rare bug in my sim
 MSmits: it would sometimes skip a hole in the bottom when moving tiles left
 MSmits: it would pass 37 validators and then fail on 3
 MSmits: but every time different validators
 kovi: close to 70k now, nice msmits
 MSmits: yeah, all online still
 BenFreanklin: cool
 MSmits: gonna try some submits with different exploration params
 MSmits: yep 2.0 gave me 72k&#160;:)
 MSmits: i need a little more to beat trictrac&#160;:)
 MSmits: oops, now I'm a robot
 DomiKo: 71K with only MC&#160;:)
 MSmits: did you do the tabu thing DomiKo?
 DomiKo: tabu thing?
 MSmits: it's a heuristic to avoid one color in the random rollout
 MSmits: to get more large groups
 DomiKo: then yes :grimacing:
 MSmits: ahh that explains that then
 MSmits: it's a strong heuristic
 MSmits: will try it soon
 DomiKo: i changed one parametr 
 DomiKo: and boom
 DomiKo: +20K
 MSmits: nice
 DomiKo: yea 93K
 MSmits: wait, why do you have a parameter if it is plain MC
 DomiKo: parametr for heuristic
 MSmits: ahh
 DomiKo: i have to say that opti will be so awesome
 MSmits: it is
 DomiKo: so unlucky that small Contest is to Sunday
 DomiKo: and I won't have time to make something better&#160;:(
 MSmits: ahh its not a real contest and you can be doing it for years if you want&#160;:)
 DomiKo: I will be doing it more next semester  :joy:
 MSmits: aww damnit!\
 MSmits:  110690
 MSmits: and 97%
 DomiKo: so close
 DomiKo: 97% is one fail?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: not sure why
 MSmits: i thought i fixed it
 DomiKo: one is weird
 MSmits: might be random server lag or something
 MSmits: i had 3-4 before
 MSmits: but my sim was bugged
 MSmits: still 97% again
 MSmits: 111026
 DomiKo: you will fix it soon
 MSmits: at least my bot is better :P
 DomiKo: ;P
 DomiKo: 96K now
 DomiKo: my goal is just 100K
 DomiKo: and I can go sleep
 MSmits: i keep losing on different testsets also
 MSmits: increasing my time buffer didn't help either
 MSmits: this is crazy, i tried submit 5 times and it fails on a different test each time, each time only 1 
 DomiKo: lol
 MSmits: yay 100% finally
 DomiKo: found bug?
 DomiKo: or just lucky submit
 MSmits: no, got lucky :P
 DomiKo: still 100% is 100% 
 DomiKo: good job
 MSmits: yeah. and still online!
 DomiKo: nice
 DomiKo: i need 3.3K points 
 MSmits: do 5k, beat dbdr
 DomiKo: and I will be proud of my online MC
 MSmits: oh i think he had more offline already nvm
 MSmits: yeah thats great DomiKo
 MSmits: I am actually doing mcts
 MSmits: so not comparable
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: heurstic is so strong
 DomiKo: so i guess that super nice for begginers
 MSmits: i went from 72k to 112k with it
 MSmits: all i did was 100% rollout picking other colors than the most common one
 MSmits: if they are available that is
 MSmits: I think you're not supposed to do it 100% though
 MSmits: allright, more tomorrow, gn!
 DomiKo: gnl
 DomiKo: gn
 CyanRook: allis, can you share your code when you finish?
 cheveuxdelin: hello
 cheveuxdelin: boys
 jrke: hey
 cheveuxdelin: whats a good website like this for programming?
 cheveuxdelin: h
 pillarglass: open.kattis.com
 Andriamanitra: who says you need ruby or bash for code golf, just won a shortest code round using C :grinning:
 Allis: That is highly unusual.

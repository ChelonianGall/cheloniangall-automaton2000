 vintprox: Am I the one who hates "Shortest code" mode?
 vintprox: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 vintprox: Why is it even in public CoC?
 vintprox: I didn't ask for it... but here comes the tournament of the shortest pythonistas' codes
 jacek: thats a challenge
 jacek: well some people love it, some people hate it
 Unkmar: Am I the only one that hates REVERSE MODE?
 vintprox: Game at least should notify whether it's going to play "Shortect code" mode or not
 Unkmar: largely, but the time I figure out what the want. I have not time left.
 vintprox: because I don't want to wait for another round to start to see whether it's Shortest mode or not
 vintprox: I swear it's annoying
 Unkmar: Would be nice to know what style of competition before we play.
 vintprox: yeah
 Unkmar: I don't need details. Just tell me it is going to be Reverse or shortest.
 Unkmar: Personally, I can handles shortest just fine. but I can't stand reverse.  I never did figure out that it was counting vowels.
 Unkmar: Had to look at shared code to figure out the pattern. By then, the game was over.
 Unkmar: Like: your job is kill the enemy.  But you don't know if you have guns, spears, arrows, swords, or knifes. How can I choose HOW to fight?
 vintprox: vowels task is a joke... knowing that IPA exists
 Unkmar: IPA?
 vintprox: international phonetic alphabet
 vintprox: maybe I don't understand something... but how does grouping vowels help... with anything?)
 vintprox: with anything but trying hard to code something unnecessarily complicated
 vintprox: "Shortest mode" third time in a row
 vintprox: :rage:
 vintprox: :sleeping:
 vintprox: fourth
 vintprox: ...

 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: #clash is for clash link spam
 eulerscheZahl: we should write a bot for this
 eulerscheZahl: like Automaton2000. but triggered by a clash link rather than the own name
 Automaton2000: time to call it a day
 eulerscheZahl: ok, maybe tomorrow then
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 loves clashers
 Automaton2000: don't ask me for a sec
 zeesop: just start
 zeesop: nvm

 jrke: can't say its slow
 Gonny: oh nice
 Illedan: Wait 5 hours and they are faster&#160;:)
 Gonny: so 3rd 1 point below the boss, probably best to resubmit?
 Gonny: lol
 jrke: nice 7000+
 Illedan: Wait a little Gonny
 MadKnight: yea submit in the last 10sec 
 Illedan: I'll join you up there in a sec and push around
 Illedan: :D
 Gonny: haha&#160;:)
 Gonny: you went 5-5 against me in your last commit
 Gonny: can you lose a tad more plz?
 Gonny: thx&#160;:)
 Illedan: after promotion yes
 Gonny: haha
 Gonny: I'm thinking of resubmitting tbh
 Gonny: I've been up there for 3 hours now
 Gonny: time is scarse
 Runner87: always second under boss is terrible. 
 jrke: btw what does this do 
 jrke: #pragma GCC option("arch=native","tune=native","no-zero-upper") //Enable AVX
 Gonny: I repushed. You know how to help me Illedan&#160;:)
 Illedan: I hope you help me&#160;;) 
 Gonny: I will do my best
 Gonny: damn it's fast
 Illedan: Don't say it too high
 Gonny: haha
 <b>**Rodrigo_the_coder slaps :rage: around a bit with a large fishbot</b>
 Gonny: last push took me 2h
 Gonny: that's the benchmark
 Gonny: so very low point of comparison
 Gonny: alright Illedan, I hope we make the cut!
 Runner87: it is possible be the first in league and no promotion?
 Gonny: yes
 Gonny: the boss doesn't count as first
 jrke: yup in legend
 Gonny: that too
 WINWINWIN: If you are not ahead of the boss then you wouldn't be promoted, if you have not finished your submit you would not be promoted
 Illedan: So damn close
 Illedan: :scream:
 Runner87: :expressionless:
 DomiKo: maras is helping!
 Illedan: They are winning me too&#160;:(
 maras: I'm trying to lower the boss's score
 maras: :P
 maras: so far it's working
 JohnCM: why is the silver boss rising in rank
 DomiKo: 0.17
 Illedan: Do it faster than I lose points&#160;:(
 DomiKo: so close
 JohnCM: now the rift is bigger and bigger
 maras: the boss is going down XD
 maras: I just won 4 times against him
 JohnCM: bring the boss down
 JohnCM: this is gold boss is it?
 maras: yep
 JohnCM: haven't reached there yet
 JohnCM: i was rank 13 silver, will be happy to break into gold before end of comp
 Illedan: maras, don't beat me too&#160;:(
 maras: I spent the whole day
 maras: from noon
 JohnCM: there's chance... 80% more battles and rank 50 alr
 JohnCM: bring me up!
 pde-bakk: whats the biggest thing separating top of gold with low gold in your eyes?
 jrke: illedan needs 2 wins
 pde-bakk: Are you guys simulating turns for you opponent too and seeing what path they might likely take?
 maras: we are the champions!
 Zenoscave: yes but my sim is awful
 maras: now it's your turn Illedan
 Illedan: gratz
 DomiKo: come come
 ClockSort: pde-bakk some of us are. (I'm not)
 Illedan: Dont leave me here&#160;:(
 Illedan: You welcome Gonny
 jrke: 2 more to legend&#160;:(
 pde-bakk: @ClockSort what did you improve on when you went from silver to gold?
 ClockSort: i went to gold when it opened. the key was really slimming down my state so i could hit depth 6-8 full bfs
 pde-bakk: oh yeah I cant hit 8 consistently
 Illedan: :tada:
 jrke: congrats ill
 Illedan: Thx MSz
 ClockSort: congrats Illedan&#160;!!
 maras: nice
 DomiKo: Gratz
 maras: :D
 struct: grats
 DomiKo: Wroc≈Çaw helped!
 mlemm: Clocksort what did you mean by slimming state to reach more depth&#160;? 
 mlemm: narrowing case number after each depth&#160;?&#160;?
 ClockSort: my state contained my list of potions in it, and i was copying it around for every sim. I switched to storing the "Castable" status in a bitfield, and storing the potion data outside the state. Then making a new sim was quick. I also put the sims in an array and created them all at turn 1. That saved the time to new up the memory for each sim.
 ClockSort: hope this helps. C# is a ****. I can't let the GC clean up my sims.
 mlemm: yeah im using c# aswell and was gonna give up and sleep until i saw your msg
 mlemm: stuck at depth 4 
 ClockSort: well the memory (mis)management is a key to being faster in C#, for sure.&#160;:)
 Gonny: Illedan!
 Gonny: damn it I wasn't here to see us go up lol&#160;:(
 mlemm: hopefully i can optimize something in the remaining time, thanks 
 Gonny: what happened?
 Illedan: \o/
 Illedan: I helped you and MSz helped me
 Illedan: :D
 Gonny: oh! Thanks&#160;:)
 JohnCM: gosh silver boss rose in rank by 1 full point
 Gonny: First time I will complain the push went too quickly lol
 Gonny: did I get promoted before the push ended?
 Illedan: About time it went quickly
 Illedan: You got promoted before me
 Illedan: You were keeping me down&#160;:(
 Gonny: oh you resubmitted again?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: :clock:
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: was 5 submits in top 10
 Gonny: oh I didn't know we could get promoted before the end of our push
 Illedan: ah, no
 Illedan: You can't
 Gonny: but I pushed after you
 Gonny: how did I get promoted before you?
 Illedan: Yeah, but my submit was done and I was below boss
 Illedan: I got fights vs others that submitted and they pushed me up and the boss down
 Gonny: oh got it, you helped me finish my submit above the boss and then someone pushed you
 Illedan:&#160;:+1:
 Gonny: well, ggs!&#160;:)
 Gonny: damn it, it's always really fun to see the last fights before promotion when you're freaking out you'll see a loss lol
 Illedan: :D
 Gonny: I can't believe I missed it
 JohnCM: almost beat the boss... rank 4
 Gonny: was I right above the boss or did I have some margin?
 Illedan: Huge margin
 Gonny: oh really?
 JohnCM: thanks to blitzprog who defeated me 4 times, my rank was pushed down
 Illedan: 1,5 points or so in the end
 Gonny: wow
 Illedan: you did beat me like 5 - 0 :P
 JohnCM: lucky blitzprog promoted to gold alr
 Samer: anything wrong with gold boss? or just a fluke? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/509627274">https://www.codingame.com/replay/509627274</a>

 Gonny: that explains how I'm not even that bad in legends
 BlitzProg: Sorry lol
 Gonny: haha sorry oO
 Illedan: NP
 Illedan: All worked out in the end&#160;:)
 BlitzProg: just pushed a very different AI I had very high confidence in, compared to the previous one
 Gonny: :punch:
 Rodrigo_the_coder: lol you win
 Gonny: Smaer gold boss times out sometimes
 Gonny: Samer *
 JohnCM: lol no worries, with you out of the pool, i shld be able to beat silver boss now
 BlitzProg: But yeah unlucky that I wasn't paired against the boss, it decided to pick other players to steal rank from
 BlitzProg: upgrade was BFS with hardcoded "Learn" to BS that also explore "Learn" routes
 JohnCM: haha i'm doing that too, only that my learn is only at current turn and not lookahead
 Samer: JohnCM how are you learning spells?
 BlitzProg: Now my AI tend to find quicker routes for potions by learning
 BlitzProg: and outspeeded nearly everyone in silver
 JohnCM: i learn the first 6 spells
 JohnCM: then after that i do comparison between learn spell 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 vs not learning
 JohnCM: and pick the route that gives highest returns
 Samer: the silver boss looks at the first 2 spells, he nabs the second if it's all positive ingredients
 BlitzProg: Well I am also "learn first 7 spells"
 Samer: nab it at third rank before he gets a chance, you'll beat him
 JohnCM: if this push doesn't make it, i'm gonna do the learn 7 spells
 JohnCM: rank 2 now:)
 BlitzProg: But I also start one BS for no spell learnt and one for every spell I can learn
 JohnCM: wa lucky no blitzprog ai to push me down now
 BlitzProg: and it seems very effective
 Samer: try learning 8 or 9 spells instead too
 BlitzProg: rank 110 gold / 467
 JohnCM: what depth is your bfs?
 JohnCM: i can only hit 7 without timeout
 JohnCM: 8 is 50
 JohnCM: 8 is 50% timeout
 JohnCM: 1st silver now.. let me promote!
 JohnCM: let me promote!!
 BlitzProg: Depth isn't really relevant now I use BS, I can easily explore the entire game if I want, at cost of pruning alternative possibilites that seemed weak at first
 BlitzProg: gl man!
 JohnCM: looking good, i already beat the boss in rank
 JohnCM: but ppl are bumping the boss up
 BlitzProg: If you're in front of the boss when you reach 100% then you're promoted
 JohnCM: 14% more to go
 BlitzProg: if not but you're close then it's up to you, maybe you can let someone push you in front for instant promotion, or send it again and try your luck
 struct: oh no clock is blinking 
 JohnCM: woohoo gold baby!
 Gonny: I'm curious, is that a deleted account last in legends? :thinking:
 Gonny: gg JohnCM
 struct: it is re curse alt
 JohnCM: thanks for the support
 struct: grats
 Illedan: oh, emil was re curse alt?
 Gonny: oh haha ok
 struct: yes
 BrunoFelthes: what is the smallest and biggest possible brew price?
 JohnCM: lol i'm gonna be last in gold
 Lysk: 20 for max
 Lysk: without bonus
 struct: 6 min

 Gonny: I was wondering why I didn't see reCurse anywhere before popping in the top 3
 Gonny: that explains it
 JohnCM: ty kreska
 linjoehan: man the time remaining is flashing red I'm still trying to get a sim working
 JohnCM: what nonsense is this gold boss.. 30 turns 90 points
 kreska: its super strong :D
 JohnCM: wa it's kinda sick
 JohnCM: it predicted i didn't have ingredients for a particular brew, so it held back the order and did another one
 JohnCM: a pity i won't have much time to play around with it
 BlitzProg: pushing in a little update
 BlitzProg: not expecting much but here we go
 cegprakash: I should have gone with greedy&#160;:( last day simulation no time to debug
 Gonny: eh Illedan looks like we're inseparable now lol
 pedrosorio: so depressing when you have no ideas / can't be bothered to re-write the whole thing and just pushing random changes in parameters that don't make any difference
 JohnCM: blitzprog, add in opponent prediction to win gold boss
 JohnCM: the gold boss obviously knows how many turns you take to brew a spell
 BlitzProg: in 4h, no  lol
 JohnCM: i mean brew a potion
 Zenoscave: pedrosorio do you mean my last 10 hours
 JohnCM: haha i'm very satisfied with my outcome for this comp alr... spent days thinking how to get gold
 BlitzProg: I only wanted to be gold in this challenge, goal is reached :D
 pedrosorio: I actually wrote a simulator calling into the github code to test random parameters and see how they did against each other
 Tyir: interesting, i removed some random fallback code that seemed to only trigger once in a blue moon, and it is doing way better
 pedrosorio: I think it just times out a bunch of times, cause I'm running several in parallel, completely useless
 pedrosorio: yeah... I reached gold "easily" soon after it opened, then did nothing during the rest of the week
 pedrosorio: no sense of achievement
 JohnCM: then try legend
 pedrosorio: I've been near the top100 of gold since Wednesday
 pedrosorio: I'm just wasting what would've been a good night's sleep
 pedrosorio: to end up in the same position
 struct: same
 struct: except the top 100 part :p
 struct: I wasnt there until today
 pedrosorio: anyway
 Gonny: last contest I spent 2 days adding a super smart quite complicated feature on FoW to see it... make no difference
 pedrosorio: have a good final hours on the challenge and enjoy
 struct: thanks
 Gonny: it's super annoying but it happens...

 rockstar555: hii
 struct: I had wong idea
 miszu: anyone will stay up till the end?
 eulerscheZahl: are you serious struct? you didn't know that before?
 Illedan:&#160;:/

 struct: When I made my first STC sim
 struct: I had 30k sims
 struct: I think
 JohnCM: seeing the gold boss play is very relaxing
 struct: Lets go rng gods
 struct: bless me
 JohnCM: the ingredients go in and out in one whole mass
 miszu: I have a master in CS... yet I have so much to learn about AIs and optimizations
 linjoehan: Ok I think I got a aprox sim to work now I need to get it into a MCTS and see if it works
 Zenoscave: My ide gives different results&#160;:/ with almost every game. hard to debug
 eulerscheZahl: that's nothing i've learnt at university either
 struct: omg
 struct: thiis submit
 struct: looks good
 miszu: took AI class in uni and have basic understanding
 struct: I cant watch
 miszu: I remember how I understood 0 about MCTS. Now I finally get it
 JohnCM: i love how the tier 1 ingredients all become tier 2, then all tier 3 for a full board of tier 3
 JohnCM: that's the gold boss
 miszu: plz nerf gold  boss
 struct: sorry if I sound a bit hyperactive too much coffee
 JohnCM: i wonder whose algo is gold boss
 struct: dbdr
 miszu: wasn't dbdr?
 Scarfield: i would have thought you learned alot about AI in CS uni, what do you learn about then?
 miszu: will you guys be active post contest?
 struct: nope
 JohnCM: i figured it out
 miszu: Scarfield I learned A*, heuristics, manhattan distance, MCTS, minimax, then lots of probabilities like Bayen and stuff
 miszu: bfs,dfs with limited depth
 miszu: 1st half of the course was interesting and applicable here. 2nd half is mostly math
 eulerscheZahl: "will you guys be active post contest?"yes
 miszu: well you yes eulerscheZahl cuz you are a mod&#160;:)
 struct: Yeah, I will too, now that I finally learn these new algos
 struct: I must try them more
 miszu: I am hoping getting gold with UTTT
 struct: and i dont really considered floodfill as bfs because all I do is a for loop to check next by cells
 kreska: so after the contest can we still submit to this game to test some algos??
 JohnCM: yea the game should still be there on codingame site
 kreska: that is nice
 JohnCM: haha my fav contest i tried so far was the harry potter one. pure heuristics got me to gold within 4-5 hours.
 miszu: the competition that I dread the most are multi agents
 JohnCM: love those
 JohnCM: it got me easy gold the last challenge
 kreska: its my first contest on this site so i dont know what game you are talking about but this thing is addicting
 JohnCM: almost made it to legend
 miszu: yeah but I have 0 clue what algorith mto use
 JohnCM: heuristics, good ones
 miszu: like the race game
 JohnCM: or.. monte carlo tree search for each agent separately
 miszu: you have to use genetics
 miszu: I find it complicated to implement it
 JohnCM: wa the gold games typically end within 30 turns
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/509665428">https://www.codingame.com/replay/509665428</a>
 JohnCM: look at this crazy efficiency.. tier 0 -&gt; tier 1 -&gt; tier 2 -&gt; tier 3 full board
 miszu: pretty funny
 AT274: Yea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 JohnCM: the spell selection is key
 JohnCM: the gold boss selects the right spell most of the time

 ClockSort: johncm beating the boss isn't enough, you have to rank above him
 Bobbadillio: I've got about 1:20 before I've gotta log off, and I'm just hoping for gold league at this point&#160;:) not sure I'll make it, we'll see!
 JohnCM: for starters, i try to beat the boss
 struct: gl Bobbadillio
 JohnCM: he wins me 90% of the time lol
 struct: Yesterday I was also silver, you can do it man
 JohnCM: yea.. some spell learning tweaks can win silver already
 JohnCM: the silver boss only has hardcoded spell learning mechanisms
 Bobbadillio: Thanks! :D I'm pretty sure I've got a shot at finishing the current move selection code I've got in mind.
 JohnCM: oh just realized i'm ranked above thibaud now
 ClockSort: at the end, is your position your final position, or do they have some kind of re-rank?
 kishorecoder: im new to this chat

 dbdr: top 9 paths?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, changed it to 8
 eulerscheZahl: depth 8 to predict end of game
 Zenoscave: 42
 dbdr: ah, I have 12
 eulerscheZahl: nothing minimax-like with potions disappearing

 linjoehan: man this one has beaten me. I'll have to just be silver for this one
 dbdr: I have a version with +12% winrate. +/- 16% ...
 WINWINWIN: What about the #2 toad, how is he doing?
 jrke: davier?
 eulerscheZahl: top gold and submitting
 pb4: I found opponent prediction really difficult to get right, only the lightest versions were even remotely good
 dbdr: if I resub, will I be stuck by freshmen optimized to play against me? :D
 eulerscheZahl: end of game is important
 eulerscheZahl: the rest seemed hard
 pb4: dbdr, you might :D
 rockstar555: eulerscheZahl you are right
 pb4: I have a version +10 elo better locally
 dbdr: well, past me at least
 pb4: Considering whether it's good to submit it...
 dbdr: you compute elo locally, using TS pb4?
 pb4: Probably won't take the risk
 pb4: Nope, elo is elo
 dbdr: ok
 pb4: But yes I do
 dbdr: nice
 struct: pb4 are you going to try and get rank 1 back?
 dbdr: selfplay then?
 pb4: It's good to track improvements this way, keeps motivation up
 pb4: dbdr, yes selfplay, but I play against many old versions of myself to try and get some variety in
 dbdr: right
 eulerscheZahl: was about to ask that
 pb4: I'll typically select 5-6 old versions of my code when playing locally
 pb4: Hence the use of elo score instead of "just" winrate

 struct: fb
 pb4:&#160;:(
 pb4: Nope
 struct: ok, just wanted to know if you had any plans for it
 pb4: Failed at CSB NN, failed at SR NN, won't get back into FB at the moment
 1400179: No NN in FB
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i totally missed the latest changes at FB
 eulerscheZahl: impressive lead
 1400179: I'm only good at dead games
 pb4: oh wow, no NN and such a big lead&#160;? Nice&#160;!
 pb4: Might try later then
 eulerscheZahl: and some broken bots from top players e.g. MrBrown77&#160;:(
 1400179: I gotta learn to shut up
 pb4: but not in the near future, spent far too much time on CG this week :D
 rockstar555: 2662 rank in coder strike back
 ClockSort: I don't think I have the capacity to make more improvements. Looking like it's a finish around 50th Gold.
 ClockSort: gg
 Csipcsirip: I didnt even reach top500 in my first one
 struct: Im not really disapointed, I fell like I didnt try hard enough for legend
 struct: despite past 3 nights
 ClockSort: sitting for 9th place among C# users, I guess that's something :laughing:
 eulerscheZahl: 10 if you add me&#160;;)
 ClockSort: hah I will be careful not to
 Csipcsirip: you betrayed c#
 struct: I think my enemy prediciton was very simplistic
 eulerscheZahl: next on your list: read the post mortems to get an idea of what you missed
 struct: I need to think of something more
 ClockSort: i entirely ignored the opponent until this final day. now i look 1 move ahead so i don't immediately walk into a loss
 ClockSort: I guess that's too simple still&#160;:)
 Csipcsirip: what about killer moves&#160;?
 ClockSort: gl in these final hours! bye now
 rockstar555: hey guys fall challange end 2 hours 
 struct: bye
 rockstar555: bye
 rockstar555: struct
 Rodrigo_the_coder: potion = choice([potionlist])
 rockstar555: what are you saying
 Zenoscave: guys please use PM don't spam the general
 rockstar555: couldn't understand Zenoscave 
 WINWINWIN: Thanks struct
 struct: more than enough warnings
 struct: I havent slept for a long time
 struct: no patience 
 WINWINWIN: :P
 rockstar555: hii
 struct: next time ban
 dbdr: +11.6% +/- 12.2 :thinking:
 Zenoscave: dbdr what are those numbers?
 dbdr: winrate improvement, with confidence interval
 Presac: Finally managed to get to silver
 Zenoscave: That CI is awful lol
 dbdr: sure, needs time to go down
 Zenoscave: how many trials?
 dbdr: sqrt is a heatless bi***
 Zenoscave: Argghh so close
 struct: maybe im missing some sqrt in my code
 eulerscheZahl: heatless?
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't it make you CPU warm?
 dbdr: heartless :D
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/509745122">https://www.codingame.com/replay/509745122</a>Where did I mess up?
 dbdr: good thing is the CI goes both ways&#160;:)
 Rodrigo_the_coder: probably slow potions
 dbdr: 12.5% +/- 11.9&#160;:)
 Rodrigo_the_coder: U need fast potions
 dbdr: looking good, but will I dare?
 struct: what rank are you?
 struct: atm
 dbdr: #19, but that's overrated
 Zenoscave: this topped out at 13th last submit
 dbdr: probably many subs
 Zenoscave: 13th gold
 dbdr: so not much to lose anyways
 AntiSquid: why overrated&#160;?
 dbdr: because of subs in progress. did not check that
 eulerscheZahl: you have a 12.5% winrate vs the old? that doesn't sound too thrilling
 dbdr: +12.5
 Zenoscave: so 62.5?
 YurkovAS: submits is fast now
 eulerscheZahl: but when the score is inflated, anything can happen on resubmit
 eulerscheZahl: getting stuck in low ranks
 dbdr: say 57.5% vs 45%
 1400179: The submits on this game are crazy
 eulerscheZahl: arena.out: 95      test.out: 111     draws: 128
 eulerscheZahl: i think that's too risky for me to submit
 1400179: And by crazy I mean incredibly stupid
 eulerscheZahl: we've long exceeded the point where i start to have the contest again
 Nerchio: poor agade lost to me and i am closing legend ranks lol
 dbdr: submits are stupid? what does that mean?
 1400179: Maybe my memory fails me but locam was better for submits if not for points?
 1400179: Submit can get stuck with random games in the middle of the league forever
 eulerscheZahl: CG system stuck or no climbing stuck?
 1400179: Or can skyrocket to top 5, wreak havoc before diving back down
 eulerscheZahl: been there. now i'm happy with my current #15 and scared to touch it again
 dbdr: I think because many games are close, could go either way. and random potions appear
 1400179: Mixture of flawed matchmaking with the game being way too random
 eulerscheZahl: and we have some kind of fog of war again
 eulerscheZahl: the next potion
 aCat: I'm happy with my uwr position
 eulerscheZahl: (and spell but that's less relevant i think)
 aCat: and my own too
 aCat: first time contest legend
 struct: grats
 dbdr: I thought about doing stats on remaining potions. but games are too short to get much signal I think
 dbdr: compared to total number of potions
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 Rodrigo_the_coder: can sombodee help me brew the fastest potion
 1400179: Game can flip from win to lose with those draws
 1400179: Please no more card games
 1400179: Even fog of war is better than this
 Rodrigo_the_coder: victory potion: using id4
 Gonny: I thought I read some people in legend tried to reverse the seed to know everything in advance? 
 1400179: Not quite possible
 struct: Dont think it possible
 Rodrigo_the_coder: reverse mode clash of code
 1400179: At least in the time frame
 Zenoscave: Struct wanna ban?
 Gonny: ah ok
 dbdr: reCurse: "fog of war is better"this technically true quote will be used out of context&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i really think they did a great job on the visuals. you can clearly see the difference to community contests. but i'm not totally happy with the gameplay
 reCurse: Would expect no less
 dbdr: actually this would be good for a shorter contest
 dbdr: 4 days maybe
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 reCurse: Visuals are nice, problem is debugging with it is as annoying as ever
 dbdr: where's your battle station?&#160;;)
 struct: true
 reCurse: Am I reading the output for what the viewer is showing me or not? Why is it always such a chore
 aCat: visuals are unreadable&#160;;/
 reCurse: Why is the share replay more readable than ide
 eulerscheZahl: and really hard to tell what's going on. you lose a game 10 turns before but as a human you don't even notice
 reCurse: Sorry I'm super grumpy right now
 rmuskovets: 1.5 hours left, and I'm adding repeatable spells to my code... are the submits fast now?
 struct: yes
 reCurse: -ish
 reCurse: They were at their best 2 hours ago
 aCat: yes way batter than 10 hs ago ;p
 rmuskovets: what does this mean: rmuskovets attempted an invalid action:Command does not match action, expected 'LEARN' but got 'CAST'
 ParticleBeam: You used the wrong command with a certain actionId
 eulerscheZahl: you tried to cast a spell from the tome?
 ParticleBeam: You tried to Brew a Learn etc
 rmuskovets: eulerscheZahl 1. I learned a spell 2. I used the same id to cast it
 ParticleBeam: The ids are different once you learn a spell
 JohnCM: when you learn a spell, different id dpeending on player
 aCat: ParticleBeam yes they are
 aCat: spell in time id&#160;!= learned spell id
 struct: so tired, not sure I will make it to legend
 aCat: This cal could - you can
 aCat: *This cat
 eulerscheZahl: you always start too late struct
 struct: true I only started for real friday
 eulerscheZahl: and are not as good as ninjadoggy or chokuda i
 JohnCM: wow
 Nerchio: OOF
 struct: i coded before
 struct: but i kept rewriting code
 reCurse: That's rough
 struct: just for sims
 eulerscheZahl: ok, kick me&#160;:(
 struct: Im aware that im not as good, I dont really mind
 dbdr: chokudai tried again, but no legend (yet) this time
 JohnCM: finally mastering the art of full inventory stocking
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509758592">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509758592</a>
 Nerchio: can mod ban a mod :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: kick works
 eulerscheZahl: haven't tried ban
 dbdr: +12 +/- 10. I ill have to do it :sweat_smile:
 struct: I think top ~100 is still a nice goal to achieve
 struct: in this large contest
 JohnCM: yea i'm trying top 100 gold now
 eulerscheZahl: top 2%
 eulerscheZahl: and dbdr is gone
 struct: I still have 1:30 hours
 dbdr: :D
 Zenoscave: dbdr is link404 detirministic
 eulerscheZahl: no
 struct: but I mean im awake for 20+ hours atm
 dbdr: Zenoscave no
 Zenoscave: Any tips on it's weaknesses :P
 dbdr: but just because of timing
 Zenoscave: I'm missing something but not sure what
 JohnCM: i found gold boss weakness
 dbdr: it crashes when it is stuck to learn only. not that it matters, that's why I left it
 eulerscheZahl: for search based contests there's rarely a real weakness at that level of gameplay
 JohnCM: he gets too engrossed in efficient conversion, sometimes he gets stuck with full inventory
 JohnCM: XD
 eulerscheZahl: just good vs even more optimal moves
 dbdr: JohnCM yes, but that's a tradeoff
 dbdr: most of the time it's worth it
 dbdr: +13 +/- 9
 rmuskovets: is the tome spells list sorted from bottom to top?
 aCat: yes
 Gonny: how do they pick the gold boss btw? They ask whoever's number XX if they can use their code as the boss?
 1400179: Do they even ask
 dbdr: in this case they asked me, yes
 aCat: they do't ask, they take!
 1400179: Ah ok
 JohnCM: they pick the #1 boss and let everyone suffer
 aCat: oh, thay did?
 dbdr: not sure if it's standard
 JohnCM: just kidding
 aCat: ok , how nice of them&#160;;-)
 rmuskovets: why does #1 work as a chat channel?
 JohnCM: probably top 20 boss
 Gonny: what rank were you when they asked you dbdr?
 dbdr: #18
 JohnCM: dbdr share your bot's weakness so we can rise
 JohnCM: haha
 Gonny: well thanks for making a boss that difficult :p
 dbdr: my pleasure&#160;:)
 1400179: They aim for 100 legend
 1400179: I think it's pretty reasonable gold boss
 Nerchio: you can advance to legend without being much better than boss i think
 Gonny: yeah that worked pretty well
 rmuskovets: &gt; why does #1 work as a chat channel? 
 1400179: Because hashtags
 rmuskovets: I can even send messages there
 Ifthel: Anything with a hashtag is a channel name
 Ifthel: #ifthel_fanclub for example
 AntiSquid: job title&#160;: chat channel
 AntiSquid: oh missread @_@
 AntiSquid: thought #1 on LB works as chat channel 
 AntiSquid: xdee
 rmuskovets: #iwantsomeadvice
 Q12: I am 11 in silver, do I have a chance of getting to gold without submit another time?
 rmuskovets: if boss get low enough, yes
 struct: unlikely
 struct: what is the point difference?
 JohnCM: oh yea.. I am more efficient than gold boss now:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509765655">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509765655</a>
 Q12: How can I see how much points the boss has?
 aCat: ide panel on the right
 aCat: leaderboard
 Q12: I have 39.55
 aCat: you see it then
 Q12: the boss is 41.13
 aCat: what happened to emil?
 Zenoscave: ask reCurse
 AntiSquid: he killed email.&#160;:(
 lowzhao: the boss is 2% higher than everyone nice
 dbdr: wanna watch me crash and burn?
 reCurse: :popcorn:
 Zenoscave: do it
 AntiSquid: YOLO
 JohnCM: just do it
 dbdr: yolo
 eulerscheZahl: submitted
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e26a227-bf36-460c-bb71-fde2507e00b8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e26a227-bf36-460c-bb71-fde2507e00b8</a>
 JohnCM: i'm pleasantly surprised how a simple change of heuristics can lead to a win in gold boss
 JohnCM: maybe i should train against #1 legend
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like those numbers dbdr
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: let's find a better start&#160;:)
 Nerchio: poor people in lower part of legend getting bombed by the top :x
 JohnCM: damn i need to go legend to play against agade's bot
 eulerscheZahl: not even that hard. everyone can beat everyone
 eulerscheZahl: except emil
 Nerchio: why does it say unnamed player
 Nerchio: you can remove your bot from contest?
 struct: deleted
 eulerscheZahl: like me having 100% vs Agade <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/fall-challenge-2020/eulerscheZahl">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/fall-challenge-2020/eulerscheZahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 3 games, not that relevant yet
 rmuskovets: struct was that emil?
 struct: yes
 aCat: you will say wahat happened?
 struct: I was not that emil
 struct: I was on discord with icebox and he deletes during a strange moment
 aCat: xD, ok, true that
 JohnCM: lol gold boss rising in rank
 Nerchio: pb has a nice lead going into the last hour
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: please continue beating Agade
 eulerscheZahl: won't get any matches with a rank difference &gt; 10&#160;:(
 struct: submit to beat agade euler
 JohnCM: wa that is a big personal sacrifice
 eulerscheZahl: i will just idle in the chat
 eulerscheZahl: i don't dare to submit again
 dbdr: who let this many pople get into legend??
 struct: yeah submits are starting to get slow
 rmuskovets: who didn't let me get into silver?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still surprised that they asked you about being boss
 eulerscheZahl: and didn't just take it
 dbdr: apo must like me :blush:
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: any idea where you're boss code would rank if you submitted it to legend&#160;?
 pb4: your*
 pb4: ...
 dbdr: around #50 is my guess
 dbdr: actually, Zorg1 barely passed and is #25
 dbdr: very hard to know
 Zorg1: h√© h√©
 JohnCM: depends on your submit luck
 dbdr: at least I did not stay stuck at bottom :sweat_smile:
 Zenoscave: If most my losses are less than 10 points what's a good strategy to mitigate that?
 Zenoscave: usually around 3/4
 JohnCM: try rushing ur last pot
 JohnCM: if opp frequently last pot u gain less
 struct: JohnCM ty, I will try that
 struct: I dont even have that
 Zenoscave: I do already
 struct: I pray that my search finds it
 Zenoscave:&#160;:/
 Scarfield: prioritize some extra above tier 1 ingredients in inventory
 AntiSquid: maybe that was your alt dbdr, so you're at the bottom :thinking:
 dbdr: what AntiSquid?
 dbdr: Zorg1, tu quoque?
 AntiSquid: the deleted rust account
 dbdr: ah
 struct: It was me, legend and delete
 struct: obvious
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: make one for every language struct
 JohnCM: then can just clock the legend every language achievement
 eulerscheZahl: zeno coming for legend now?
 eulerscheZahl: oh you dropped
 Zenoscave: sssshhhh don't risk jinxing it
 eulerscheZahl: 35
 JohnCM: oo rank 139 gold...
 JohnCM: very happy with my bot's performance
 kreska: wow that is amazing
 kreska: nice
 JohnCM: i totally revamped my heuristics after playing with gold boss
 JohnCM: try to get that clear entire inventory effect
 dbdr: someone should make an extension to disable the submit button
 Gonny: did you submit by mistake?
 dbdr: "CG safety mode"
 Zenoscave: did you press it accident
 jrke: yes happens sometimes i press submit sometimes accidently
 Gonny: actually they should put a popup asking if you really want to submit
 rmuskovets: make you need to do up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A-Enter to enable the submit button
 Zenoscave: they do if you haven't played yet
 Gonny: we don't submit enough that the hasle outweighs the benefits
 dbdr: "solve the descent to prove you're sober"
 Gonny: yeah but have it all the time
 AntiSquid: there is . if you modify code after pressing play = safety mode
 ToshiTuringMachine: Hi guys. How do you get elapsed milliseconds in c++?

 eulerscheZahl: chrono::_V2::system_clock::time_point start= std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
 ToshiTuringMachine: ty eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 Cappefra: ah yes the straightforwardness of c++
 aCat: why is benchmar so slow I wanted to tune one thing xD
 Cappefra: how was it again? silver doesn't get an automatical resubmit right?
 aCat: nope
 aCat: only end of calc of those who already submitted and didn;t finish
 rockstar555: HII
 Gonny: what happens if you submit a legend bot in silver right before the end?
 Gonny: does it compute to gold, then recomputes there, then gets to legend?
 Cappefra: @gonny then you wake up and it was for sure a beautiful dream
 Gonny: lol
 rmuskovets: and you remember the silver was also a dream
 Cappefra: haha
 Cappefra: for real though I'm so disappointed&#160;:/ first time not making it to gold
 rmuskovets: I'm in bronze for the first time
 SirLoxley: grats mate
 rmuskovets: on OOC and Platinum Rift 2 I was in wood-1
 rmuskovets: this one is "simple to learn, hard to master" imo
 JohnCM: this game is hard
 Traquila: Gold for my first contest
 kreska: congrats rmuskovets
 rmuskovets: Traquila fall challenge is the first contest you participated in?
 Nerchio: tbh what i wrote for silver here is also the same thing in legend except more sophisticated lol
 Traquila: Yes I discover this website 3 weeks ago
 rmuskovets: wow
 Nerchio: improved performance, from bfs to beam search and some eval changes
 Nerchio: nice Traquila
 RicksMLC: *phew* This is fun!  Hi all.

 JohnCM: take spells which and brew potions which give them the most possibilities
 Inc_: both are trolling
 rockstar555: yes both are trolling
 Inc_: Well, AI tries to somehow beat player
 Inc_: because he is behind
 rockstar555: JohnCM is right
 JohnCM: i have two versions of a program, shall submit each one and see which does better
 Zenoscave: Maybe. submits are slow. may only have time for one
 Inc_: let them fight against eachother
 Gonny: def only time for one
 JohnCM: but the better one fares worse in arena
 Gonny: I don't think it'll finish by 4
 Nerchio: what i suggest is
 AntiSquid: 39 minutes
 Nerchio: submit until you get a good starter streak
 Nerchio: which is like 9/10 wins if you can do it
 Nerchio: :D
 eulerscheZahl: he is top gold already
 JohnCM: either way the better one is in arena now
 eulerscheZahl: 60% and right below the boss
 rmuskovets: I give up.

 struct: Doesnt look that bad
 struct: rank 28 20%
 Gonny: yeah python killed me on this contest, couldn't reach top 100 until Friday, I basically spent the whole week trying to get to a depth comparable to you guy's
 andrefpoliveira: Damn struct
 andrefpoliveira: Its almost finished ahah
 andrefpoliveira: Then you can go sleep
 andrefpoliveira:&#160;:)
 Ravi1269: how do i run my code in clash of code
 jrke: i got an idea for resubmission 1 hour ago and now i am thinking why i resubmitted
 Q12: Can I submit now?
 struct: I think I will gamble and submit again
 aCat: yes
 jrke: Q12 at your own randomness risk
 Q12: ok
 Q12: I will take the risk
 BoBot: lol I am going through my submits 2 days ago because I remembered that I sometimes beat Gold boss then - after getting to Gold...I do not now...
 BoBot: 2 wasted days
 jrke: randomness just stay with me for till my submission ends
 Michael_Howard: Well good luck everyone!
 eulerscheZahl: i make screenshots when my bot did will. configured it to save it directly to my disk with a single key press. that makes it easy to find the code again
 hasleron: What does resubmitting mean for the end result? Are you getting the rank you're at in 8 min?
 Nerchio: no
 aCat: no wait for recalc finish
 jrke: no after 8 mins you won't be able to make any submits
 struct: euler in your opinion do I resubmit or not?
 eulerscheZahl: legend league has a recalc. for leagues below your submit will finish
 struct: I have bot that is beating my best one that placed around 30 by 78% to 15%
 jrke: but ongoing dubmits will continue
 hasleron: oh damn
 eulerscheZahl: that's significant, try it
 struct: Did it
 Michael_Howard: I finally submitted yesterday's version (#100 silver) with the 2-depth tree &amp; no repeatables because I didn't leave myself enough time to get repeatables &amp; full trees working well together. :sob:
 eulerscheZahl: and resubmit at 9:59 if it's not working on the leaderboard&#160;;)
 reCurse: Stop saying that
 reCurse: Rerun will start 2 hours later
 reCurse: -_-
 eulerscheZahl: it's night for you, isn't it?
 struct: I thnk it will be more
 reCurse: 4am
 jrke: i think rerun will start when all ongoing submissions will end
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 struct: 9 am
 struct: woke up at 11am
 eulerscheZahl: 9:54am
 eulerscheZahl: woke up at 6
 jrke: its 2:24pm
 Michael_Howard: I've been up 23.5 hours
 eulerscheZahl: 5:30 actually. neighbors cat broke into my house again
 eulerscheZahl: stole my cat's food
 reCurse: So don't resubmit
 reCurse: Bad idea
 jrke: that bad idea came in my mind 1 hour ago&#160;:(
 rmuskovets: 5 minutes!
 eulerscheZahl: 307 computing

 Zenoscave: dumb mistake
 struct: lost 2/13 maybe i resubmit :fire:
 NOaga6690: can someone help me in coders strike back tutorial?

 rmuskovets: there's something happening with the chat
 Zenoscave:&#160;:(
 struct: ok last second submit
 AntiSquid: oh i think there's one tiny tweak you could do euler
 AntiSquid: ah chat dead again&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: final minute, 321 computing
 struct: even had to solve captcha
 eulerscheZahl: contest is over!
 eulerscheZahl: i'm stuck on that tiny tweak for days
 BoBot: ooh, syamashi about Gold Boss, last to get to Legend?!
 PED: yeah his food was stolen
 struct: site breaking all over the place?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: seems to be a bit weird
 Gonny: where can we see the temporary leaderboard?
 Gonny: oh I found it
 Whiskee: if the last run doesn't go through I'm gonna cri
 BoBot: wait were you guys discussing chokudai yesterday? that he started yesterday? he is mid-Gold now and his last submit seems to be doing well
 struct: early too tell
 dbdr: wlesavo nice start!
 rmuskovets: can I still write code for the challenge?
 jrke: not yet
 eulerscheZahl: yes, in 1 or 2 days probably
 andrefpoliveira: How do we check our final placement?

 wlesavo: dbdr nah, just had to resubmit because over night got dragged down quite a bit, waned to check if it was a real place
 andrefpoliveira: Tyyyy
 struct: oh well
 struct: I go to sleep
 struct: my last submit started very badly
 ChrisSkyRo: do previous contests become normal games after a while?
 eulerscheZahl: ok, good morning struct&#160;:)

 wlesavo: jrke D&amp;B&amp;D&amp;R
 jrke: 177 registered for Codingame spring challenge 2021
 Clagus: +1
 lifetimeLearner007: 2021 contest poster looks cool. I was expecting something like that this time but...
 eulerscheZahl: it's a placeholder
 Clagus: xD
 eulerscheZahl: they always use that before they have the final one
 lifetimeLearner007: lol. xD
 Murleys: has anyone done the weekly challenge, I cannot seem to get the faces correct and eulers formula doesn't work ...
 1400179: Oh May 6... earlier than I thought.
 LunaBread: when can we see our code for the fall challenge 
 Astrobytes: not early enough imo :P
 lifetimeLearner007: contest every 5-6 months right.?
 LunaBread: so true
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>view report
 1400179: Was expecting june
 eulerscheZahl: and game itself will probably be back in 1-2 days
 Astrobytes: fingers crossed for your one euler
 Murleys: the lost files, anyone done this challenge?
 lifetimeLearner007: it would be nice if next one is in march like in 2019
 AntiSquid: choku didn't get legend in one day, guess the contest was very hard indeed
 eulerscheZahl: and kodle only silver&#160;:(
 andrefpoliveira: When will the leaderboard stabilizy?
 andrefpoliveira: 1h?
 1400179: lol
 andrefpoliveira: stabilize*
 Murleys: can someone look into the lost files challenge, it says planar graphs, however none of the test cases besides the first one actually follows eulers rule, making it technically impossible to know the exact number of faces ...
 Astrobytes: a good couple of hours
 andrefpoliveira: Okok
 andrefpoliveira: Tomorrow I will came back and check xD
 aCat: lower leagues should finish quite fast
 Zaphus: only 65 left computing, I don't think it will take hours
 Sheeptoaster: Got a question about starting up here if anyone has any time to help a new guy out, I'd appreciate it.
 andrefpoliveira: Where do you see how many are still going on
 aCat: 58 I see ;p

 Astrobytes: oh, yeah, sorry. Legend rerun will be ages
 andrefpoliveira: Oh I found it
 aCat: you can sort by score: computing
 jrke: andrefpoliveira where you ended?
 andrefpoliveira: Silver xD
 Zenoscave: 6th&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: Had a bad streak at the end
 eulerscheZahl: fix it
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait
 Zenoscave: -_-
 andrefpoliveira: AHAHAH
 aCat: vaery funny ;p
 Zenoscave: 87th is probably one of my best so far
 eulerscheZahl: amoung 7k
 andrefpoliveira: Well my first challenge so it was good&#160;:)
 LordSkaven: I am very happy with my 804th, I wanted to do better, but literally everything I tried made my bot worse
 SinOfWrath: Global 200-215 is less than 0.1 from each other. My rank is changing on every 5 sec refresh by 10 even though no one is submitting there. :D
 aCat: so legend close at 81
 Zenoscave: yup
 aCat: if they don't kick anyone out
 Zenoscave: maybe one
 aCat: yep
 aCat: 80/7k
 aCat: seems legend a good name
 Bojan: gg, it was a great challenge :D 
 jrke: damn was 1st from last 5 days in INDIA but in last resubmit ended 2nd 
 jrke:&#160;;(&#160;;(&#160;;(
 lifetimeLearner007: anid boosted up in the last few hours
 eulerscheZahl: found another repo? :P
 jrke: lol
 Zenoscave: lol
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jrke: Anid started from python3 then javascript then changed to C#
 Zenoscave: anid just copies code found online jrke
 Astrobytes: just saw that. Wonder why... :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509677309">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509677309</a>
 eulerscheZahl: CG has some cheat detection
 AntiSquid: boot ksaw and start recalc :P
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure it will get removed
 Astrobytes: ffs, didn't even bother to change the output text
 1400179: What is shame
 Zenoscave: pity
 Zenoscave: at least he didn't get a higher rank
 eulerscheZahl: still awake reCurse?
 AntiSquid: actually they booted alts last contest, so similar codes can be booted, best to avoid alts even for testing
 1400179: Somehow
 1400179: Please do not hold me responsible for things I say
 Astrobytes: oof, late one. Or early :thinking:
 lifetimeLearner007: get some sleep, the contest is over
 tobk: huh, leaderboard already settled? no day-long recompute of top 100?
 1400179: It's not over
 lifetimeLearner007: well, no more submissions possible right.. so, I think its over
 Zenoscave: they recalc legend
 1400179: Not over until rerun is over
 aCat: yeah... I should change one param&#160;:(
 aCat: ;p
 eulerscheZahl: it ain't over till the fat lady sings
 karliso: recurse First 3 places are same same as in csb. Did you find this similar to csb in some way?
 reCurse: Strange question&#160;:) Not at all
 daffie: my grandpa used to say that
 Astrobytes: your grandpa played CSB? :D
 Zenoscave: Mine too
 WINWINWIN: Legend recalc done?
 daffie: I mean when the fat lady sings
 reCurse: Didn't start
 eulerscheZahl: not even started windows_98
 eulerscheZahl: WINWINWIN
 Astrobytes: I know :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: too many users online for tab completion
 WINWINWIN: Oh, all top 3 have always been close&#160;:)
 OldJohn: Sorry what is csb&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Coders strike Back
 WINWINWIN: Another contest.
 AntiSquid: windows 93
 OldJohn: thanks
 Zenoscave: only two i see in my list aren't mods
 reCurse: Come on
 reCurse: Press the button
 Zenoscave: Press it
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJDGcxAf9D8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJDGcxAf9D8</a>
 andrefpoliveira: Only legeds left to recalculate?
 dbdr: bring back .emil!
 Zenoscave: make emil great again
 AntiSquid: emil. 's life matters&#160;!
 reCurse: Yay
 jrke: so its confirmed that i am not getting a tee:slight_smile:
 Westicles: press the whopper button
 eulerscheZahl: it started
 reCurse: itshappening.gif
 andrefpoliveira: Good luck everyone
 Zenoscave: surpised dapo didn't show up after all
 lifetimeLearner007: didn't know there's a re-count for legends.. well.... good luck guys..
 Rounddice: I hope for top 10
 reCurse: No prizes
 Zenoscave: ah
 Csipcsirip: gl boys
 andrefpoliveira: I guess lower leagues are closed
 WINWINWIN: Will the leaderboard shrink later?
 AntiSquid: why zeno? he hasn't been around for a long time
 Zenoscave: there was some speculation
 andrefpoliveira: This will take a while xD
 AntiSquid: based on what
 lifetimeLearner007: it'll be interesting if the whole leaderboard gets changed after this recount. 
 jrke: every league is closed andrefpoliveira but they will release a multi for same
 Zenoscave: he was typing on discord before contest and stopped
 lifetimeLearner007: whole legend leaderboard*
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 WINWINWIN: Like it did in Spring Challenge? Any idea how much it would shrink by?
 jrke: it didn't shrinked i think
 eulerscheZahl: they moved the complete leaderboard and bot history from contest to multi
 eulerscheZahl: (the code history)
 wlesavo: would there be an alternative ranking euler? :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: it didn't shrink, just removed duplicate / very similar bots WINWINWIN
 AntiSquid: there were like 5-7 
 WINWINWIN: Oh..
 WINWINWIN: So no mmajor changes in LB?
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/T6kuEcs">https://imgur.com/a/T6kuEcs</a>
 Zenoscave: jrke did you post your bot on github
 wlesavo: ohh nice
 jrke: nope
 jrke: so should we expect anid will be removed antisquid
 maddenvvs: Good luck everyone! You're very welcoming and motivating community!
 AntiSquid: what's that euler&#160;?
 jrke: btw Zenoscave why are you asking that
 eulerscheZahl: my virtual desktop #4
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, maddenvvs they`re all really nice guys.
 WINWINWIN: Hope to see you in the next contest.
 Zenoscave: anid gives very similar output to you. just wondering if he stole yours. but it seems he is in a diff lang
 jrke: anid changed 3 langs
 AntiSquid: i mean what is it for&#160;? just replay download or what&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: python -&gt; JS -&gt; C#
 jrke: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: i only did 2&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: ah right
 eulerscheZahl: failed to find a 3rd good repo :D
 Zenoscave: 1st time i stuck with my first lang through
 jrke: me c++ python3(just for random choice move selection on first day) then back to c++
 AntiSquid: i used python for bronze, does it count as 2 languages?
 eulerscheZahl: let's only consider changes at silver+
 Zenoscave: how arbitrary euler
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 jrke: when will we get CPs for this
 eulerscheZahl: just be patient
 dbdr: ah, just got in range to feed off eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i can say tomorrow or next week. will you believe me if i do?
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps dbdr around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: and i already lost to you
 dbdr: that's why I'm saying it
 wlesavo: dbdr i feed everyone equally, i think i have a communist in me
 eulerscheZahl: only good guy kovi is helping me
 Zenoscave: why would you eat a communist wlesavo
 Zenoscave: they're starchy from all the potatoes
 dbdr: wlesavo nice
 XprophEtX: guys, how long until the fall challenge is reopened again?
 kovi: be my gues euler. hopefully i can afford it
 kovi: guest
 WINWINWIN: XprophEtX I think it took a week last timme before it came out as a multi
 wlesavo: Zenoscave you should try one, some are delicious
 Zenoscave: I might
 xSkyline: is there going to be some editorials from legend coders for this event&#160;?
 Zenoscave: fixit XprophEtX
 Zenoscave: xSkyline
 Zenoscave: ezpz
 Westicles: Things are tight at the tshirt line
 Zenoscave: ok 3 am here. third night with little sleep i gotta go
 Zenoscave: gn
 eulerscheZahl: good night
 Astrobytes: gn Zeno
 Zenoscave: PEWPEWPEW
 dbdr: so nice to see matches this fast!
 eulerscheZahl: no. how shall i keep the pace at downloading?
 dbdr: crowdsource it
 eulerscheZahl: my system isn't designed for that. maybe next time
 kovi:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like an interesting project
 dbdr: if you fetch the ids in priority, hopfully the replayis don't disappear too fast
 jrke: how to see report of someone else
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i do
 eulerscheZahl: regular fetching
 eulerscheZahl: so far i got all i wanted
 kovi: dl only top20
 eulerscheZahl: which is about 24k replays
 eulerscheZahl: did Rounddice break the bot? saw him much higher this day
 Rounddice: No, it's actually the same as submitted ca. 12 hours ago
 AntiSquid: hopefully you can still roll a good rank
 eulerscheZahl: oh. i guess i just got really lucky then. or you unlucky
 kovi: which place you started with?
 eulerscheZahl: me?
 kovi: rounddice
 Rounddice: I think like 8th
 Nerchio: i was like 50th at best and i dropped to 73 rip :D
 Rounddice: Maybe I was just stuck up there because I submitted a long time ago
 kovi: yeah, some kind of nemesis ascended and pushed you down
 andrefpoliveira: What is the prize for the 3 winners?
 eulerscheZahl: canvas with contest artwork
 eulerscheZahl: 40x30cm
 AntiSquid: it's a canvas with the witches on it
 rockstar555: COMPETE  CONTEST CODINGAME SPRING CHALLENGE 2021 you have registered to this contest
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 andrefpoliveira: Damn thats nice
 eulerscheZahl: screws are included
 andrefpoliveira: Ahahah
 rockstar555: 323 CodinGamers have registered to this contest
 wlesavo: whichvas
 lifetimeLearner007: witch canvas might look ugly in any part of the home
 eulerscheZahl: thank you AntiSquid
 kovi: on the other hand karliso is improving well
 AntiSquid: it's the 2nd kick though
 karliso: I submitted in last seconds
 karliso: It was not planned
 AntiSquid: just random lines nonstop . ban next time rockstar555
 karliso: I think I submitted worse version
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Nerchio: damn euler you're getting beat down
 eulerscheZahl: the classic last second bad idea
 eulerscheZahl: well, i have a pretty bad bot :P
 karliso: I was testing some version and it gave good results... vs me.
 eulerscheZahl: it's your duty to beat it
 Nerchio: i went from 50 to 73 sad to see&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i didn't submit my best bot, but there's only 100 ranks difference wouldn't have matters :D
 eulerscheZahl: my best was 25-&gt;91
 AntiSquid: mattered *
 eulerscheZahl: evil recalc
 dbdr: lucky precalc rank
 lifetimeLearner007: will there be another recalc after this one?
 dbdr: recalc the recalc
 karliso: I would be happy with top 10.
 eulerscheZahl: in the multiplayer i got right next to those uses who were next to me before
 dbdr: ah then ok
 AntiSquid: yes on the multiplayer game you can recalc all day every day lifetimeLearner007
 dbdr: pacman2020 right?
 Westicles: I think a good prize would be 55ms for the next contest
 lifetimeLearner007: haha... 
 eulerscheZahl: coders of the carribean
 dbdr: ah, wasn't born
 lifetimeLearner007: why stop at 55ms, let it be 100ms :p
 wlesavo: Westicles  the real prize is the time we spent? :smiley:
 AntiSquid: no, that's the investment you made
 Westicles: groan
 Donotalo: next contest May 6??&#160;:( i'll forget how to spell codinggame&#160;:(
 Westicles: you already did
 AntiSquid: does it help to keep track of how often you visit a state that leads to a brew so you focus on states that are more likely to yield brews&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for explaining the joke
 Astrobytes: lmao westicles, play multiplayers in the meantime Donotalo
 Donotalo: (that's intentional)
 Westicles: ah, that's a whoosh on me
 Donotalo: i like real contest
 AntiSquid: a long woooooooooosh :P
 Donotalo: missing those days when CG used to release a game every 2/3 months
 Astrobytes: yeah
 lifetimeLearner007: yeah
 AntiSquid: they were probably too much under pressure&#160;?!
 eulerscheZahl: i remember 2 CG contests at once
 Astrobytes: try the user-created games, some of them are pretty good
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic and the accountant
 dbdr: wat?
 eulerscheZahl: HS wasn't finished when TAC started
 JFB: It was strange contest. Congratulations for aCat - you school 1st. And 6 persons in Legend. And it looks that contest was very popular in Japan schools - 2nd - 6th places in the rank 
 Donotalo: i've played many games on CG all are fun when i started
 Donotalo: but now i like real contest
 Donotalo: life is not giving enough time
 dbdr: I mean what were they thinking?
 dbdr: maybe a sponsor request?
 boon-cpu: YOOOOOOO
 eulerscheZahl: TAC was sponsored and related to a movie coming to cinemas
 eulerscheZahl: HS was long announced
 AntiSquid: do students who beat aCat get better marks as bonus&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: TAC even had $10k for the winner
 Astrobytes: nah they lose marks AntiSquid :P
 dbdr: good movie too if I remember correctly
 eulerscheZahl: i've never seen it
 JFB: I have on DVD&#160;:-)

 eulerscheZahl: so smits didn't play this contest&#160;:(
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:(
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: nor robo
 Westicles: I remember when they used to make movies
 JFB: All OK with him? 
 AntiSquid: maybe no time&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Smits is just busy
 Astrobytes: teaching &amp; learning etc
 AntiSquid: i only was here about 2-3 days trying to fix something 
 JFB: OK
 rkfcccccc: hello guys
 rkfcccccc: whatss upp
 AntiSquid: hi
 rkfcccccc: where u from dud
 AntiSquid: what's the r in your name? recycled&#160;?
 Rounddice: My bot is coming for yours eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: oh no!
 rkfcccccc: my name is vlad
 rkfcccccc: im from thailand
 rkfcccccc: what s ur name
 JFB: I have mixed filling about my results. 1st time I in 1st 100 (83) so success for me. But from 2nd hand - I 2nd in Gold - so very near Legend. Maybe next time
 AntiSquid: and live in russia&#160;?
 rkfcccccc: im a gypsy
 eulerscheZahl: as long as i stay in top20 i'm fine with you beating me Rounddice
 lifetimeLearner007: mixed feeling*
 AntiSquid: :thinking: that's random
 JFB: Yes
 Astrobytes: very close JFB
 rkfcccccc: yes
 AntiSquid: asked about the r because your name is r KFC cccc, get it&#160;?
 dbdr: top 2 is super close
 Westicles: seize back our KFC?
 rkfcccccc: if u will write it with my keyboard layout, u will get a word "cool" written in my language
 BoBot: yea, my version from ~2 days ago did ~200 places better than my most recent version, glad I found that version in the last 15 minutes of the contest and could resubmit :DI was wondering if it was because my Gold opponents had gotten better...no, it was because I had gotten worse..
 Nerchio: 20th is a hotspot :P
 aCat: AntiSquid
 BoBot: omg, it truly is
 aCat: nope 
 Guinsoo: when can we play the fall challenge again
 eulerscheZahl: and you can be relaxed while watching it Nerchio
 BoBot: so much effort spent for a T-shirt
 Nerchio: like 12 ppl +- 0.5 points
 AntiSquid: so astro was right then, aCat
 aCat: but +1 point for legend, +1 for top 50, +1 for top 100
 Nerchio: yeah i am relaxed steadily going down :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 Guinsoo: oh euler u made tower dereference :D
 eulerscheZahl: i consider that the weakest of my contributions&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Guinsoo, fall challenge will be available again in a day or 2
 Guinsoo: ye it's kinda dumb with the fire tower but it was fun!!
 JFB: No other school  with &gt;3 persons in Legend aCat
 AntiSquid: BoBot i mean if it were just for t-shirt then there's no point competing since you work those hours and buy a CG shirt :P
 Guinsoo: Okay thanks a lot
 eulerscheZahl: bad balancing
 andrefpoliveira: The fire tower is op?
 BoBot: @AntiSquid yea it was mostly a joke - though I did not know you could buy them :D
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Guinsoo: Yesss
 Westicles: engineers will do anything for a tshirt
 andrefpoliveira: Ahah okok
 andrefpoliveira: I just took a look last day
 eulerscheZahl: but i won't change that now after release
 AntiSquid: i think i like tower defence game most from your contribs, just didn't hav etime yet for it euler
 wlesavo: what a time to look at cg stats
 Guinsoo: I always loved TDs
 eulerscheZahl: different players have a different taste. TD isn't for sim but can probably be fun with heuristics
 lifetimeLearner007: recurse score is finally rising after a constant drop
 AntiSquid: i use sims, just not very hardcore on the sims
 Nerchio: pb4 and agade close too interesting :P
 BoBot: btw, people who have programmed both in Rust and C++, do you think Rust is easier to pick up/learn? it seems like performance wise it is at least competitive with C++I have never really gotten into low level not-memory-managed languages, coming from Java/Python background
 dbdr: BoBot do you prefer stricter compiler checks or debugging crashes?
 dbdr: (honest question)
 Guinsoo: Which one is stricter
 BoBot: compiler checks
 dbdr: rust
 BoBot: definitely
 AntiSquid: how do you feel about the syntax c++ vs rust dbdr&#160;?
 dbdr: then I recommend rust
 BoBot: fail fast, I am scared of undefined behaviors and weird bugs that apparently C++ can have :D
 NicolasH_42: BoBot ive learn rust during this challenge and its very nice
 AntiSquid: let's say c++ was like rust, apart from syntax only 
 BoBot: again, I started programming in Java
 Guinsoo: It has no garbage collection but is still safe? whoa
 dbdr: AntiSquid rust syntax is slightly more unusual at first, but I think nice afterwards. I don't think syntax matters much in the end
 BoBot: yea @Guinsoo I am also very interested in how that works
 BoBot: @dbdr the syntax is what is putting me off a bit - so many special character - that is why I hated PHP as well $ everywhere
 dbdr: not that many, is there? &amp; for references, but that's in C++ too
 lifetimeLearner007: you wouldn't like angularjs then
 BoBot: seems like a minor thing, easy to get used to, but I believe in clean and clutterless syntax :D
 dbdr:&#160;? for unwrapping
 dbdr: what else?
 BoBot: @dbdr that is just first impressions, I literally learned about the language's existance last week :D
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: syntax looks really weird, only reason i didn't try rust
 BoBot: and I have been doing Python for the last few years, which does not even have curly brackets
 AntiSquid: python best syntax :P
 BoBot: I almost started converting my code to Rust this weekend, but got cold feet - probably too short of a timeframe anyway with a new language
 dbdr: yeah, a few days is too short
 BoBot: I will try with smaller problems first, maybe next contest :D
 wlesavo: –∑–Ω–µ—Ä—â—Ç –≤—â—É—ã —Ä—Ñ–º—É curly brackets –µ—Ä—â–≥–ø—Ä
 wlesavo: damn
 BoBot: hahahaa Cyrillic
 dbdr: I really started rust in a one month constest, and taking my time
 tomatoes: :grinning:
 wlesavo: python does have curly brackets though
 AntiSquid: ban
 BoBot: @wlesavo well yea, but not for code blocks
 Guinsoo: I like C for his performance and control (pointers) but I've been learning java at uni and I like the objects, it's just better organized. My friend tells me that Java is slow af and he's right I guess so I think I should try C++ next?
 aCat: I definitaly want to learn rust
 wlesavo: oh you meant that
 BoBot: @Guinsoo lol Java is not slow as fuck, that is some C++ privileged speak
 aCat: seems I need some fast language in my portfolio
 Guinsoo: Oh really
 dbdr: aCat what's your main lang?
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC codeball contest
 aCat: hmmm
 Guinsoo: I'll just keep doing Java for now then
 eulerscheZahl: and i used java for it :D
 dbdr: yes, one fast one is definitely a good idea
 Nerchio: BoBot for competitions here and 50ms time limit Java feels slow when its competition is C++
 BoBot: if "slow as fuck" is "top 3 out of the top 10" most popular languages then yea
 aCat: I use c# whan I can, Python when its easier, Java when I have to
 BoBot: true Nerchio, but this site is pretty much a corner case in programming :D
 aCat: Lua when I tteach Lua or have to do something with c++
 Nerchio: i like Java but here it has obvious disadvantages
 Guinsoo: I did a tree search for the Fall contest in Java and could only look 3 turns ahead, but I guess I didn't optimize it well
 TwoLate: I'm right behind FrequentlyMissedDeadlines. How appropriate..
 dreadylein: :D
 eulerscheZahl: for the top you probably need more than 10 turns lookahead
 Guinsoo: But how
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i might write something about bit operations for the inventory later the day
 AntiSquid: 1001 states guinso
 Guinsoo: :heart_eyes:
 Guinsoo: What?
 WINWINWIN: No imagination in contest titles any more&#160;:(
 Nerchio: euler im scared for you
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl how do you feel about your tshirt?
 dbdr: same thought
 AntiSquid: total possible combinations of gems player can have GuillaumeSLD
 eulerscheZahl: i'm skydiving right now
 AntiSquid: Guinsoo *
 Nerchio: there is a nice and cozy place 77th place below me if u want :D
 dbdr: I can only fall too, let's stop the recalc, who's for that?

 AntiSquid: STOP THE COUNT
 WINWINWIN: :joy: :joy:
 BoBot: did not know the chat does that
 Nerchio: not again antisquid
 GuillaumeSLD:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: sorry
 AntiSquid: pinged wrong person
 AntiSquid: was addressing Guinsoo
 Guinsoo: A Rigged Election!
 wlesavo: euler dont drop out of tshirt range :worried:
 LordSkaven: Do they make tshirts for frogs?
 WINWINWIN: Tshirt is Top 50 right? And top of lang?
 Astrobytes: Toads man, toads!
 AntiSquid: go offline euler . live the dream
 eulerscheZahl: top20
 eulerscheZahl: top50 was years ago
 WINWINWIN: So Euler anyway gets a tshirt for 1st in C#?
 eulerscheZahl: the first in a language is also long gone
 LordSkaven: he was a traitor and used C++ as well
 WINWINWIN: :P
 BoBot: that T-shirt inflation&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: they didn't do any more top of lang since WW
 WINWINWIN: I`m behind the times&#160;:(
 BoBot: wait, it is the other way around with inflation
 eulerscheZahl: down to 20, i'm ready to /flip
 AntiSquid: deflation BoBot
 WINWINWIN: Tied with Yorkov and .01 ahead of wala&#160;:)
 BoBot: some of the first contests I did even had monetary prizes :O
 BoBot: Accountant optimization was one I think
 eulerscheZahl: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 eulerscheZahl: there we go
 Guinsoo: :laughing:
 ToshiTuringMachine: and the winner is....    C++&#160;! (again)
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i don't think that i belong in top20 with that bot
 AntiSquid: this is where one starts to look forward to RAIC 
 LordSkaven: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i will play RAIC
 WINWINWIN: Did you submit a wrong version euler?
 eulerscheZahl: don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: just other players being better than me
 AntiSquid: 1 rust 1 java
 eulerscheZahl: and 22nd
 Traquila: python #25
 AntiSquid: nice
 WINWINWIN: Awesome Gonny
 BoBot: keep that Python dream alive!
 Traquila: and java #24 its crazy
 BoBot: wala 19th with Java as well rn
 <b>**LordSkaven starts petition to ban all non toads that are in legend</b></p><p><img src="/a/44652281107032" /> WINWINWIN: The #2 Toad, Daiver, is now #320? He was in the top 100 for a long time wasnt he?
 eulerscheZahl: broken submit?
 WINWINWIN: Looks like it, his score isnt computing.
 eulerscheZahl: back to 20
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, that thrill
 dbdr: by 0.0
 Nerchio: what happens when 10 people at 20th will have the same score
 Nerchio: they give out 30 tshirts?
 Nerchio: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: there are more decimals
 eulerscheZahl: just not shown
 dbdr: tshirt decided by a rounding error
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: random winner
 AntiSquid: i think they would, there was a convo once, but there are decimals Nerchio
 kovi: lets make a deal: cut it half (left-right arm/side)
 eulerscheZahl: thank you king salomon
 jrke: top3 looks similar as expected
 Nerchio: the biggest upset of the recalc is me going down 25 places
 Nerchio: for sure
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl at 90%, what is your timer? I have 35ms, at 85%
 Nerchio: i blame java because why not
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/711887567590654013/780381057786445844/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/711887567590654013/780381057786445844/unknown.png</a> pb didn't even plot you
 eulerscheZahl: 40ms
 eulerscheZahl: shorter matches?
 AntiSquid: when did the limit get fixed?
 dbdr: can be
 eulerscheZahl: that's something we could extract as i got the replays now
 eulerscheZahl: 46k already
 AntiSquid: i only tried this morning 40ms
 eulerscheZahl: i always used 40
 karliso: cgstats says that Agade is 53% vs pb4 over 86 games
 AntiSquid: was timing out at 20-25 last week&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: CG stats doesn't have the full history
 pb4: We've exchanged binaries to test right now karliso
 karliso: cool
 eulerscheZahl: did you send him a virus?
 JFB: trojan&#160;:-)
 pb4: Should have in case he won :D
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 Agade 68 75 7
 eulerscheZahl: win loss draw
 pb4: He has 45.9% +- 0.5 winrate vs me
 eulerscheZahl: so a little in Agade's favor
 pb4: over 17k games apparently
 eulerscheZahl: and how do you could draws in that?
 pb4: 0.5
 karliso: 17k games?
 eulerscheZahl: so you are a little stronger on the long run
 pb4: Seems so
 eulerscheZahl: looking good for you to win. i'll wait a little longer to congratulate
 karliso: I need a new pc
 AntiSquid: RAIC will probably have one as prize
 JFB: Usually had
 eulerscheZahl: but they are saving on tshirts+hoodies this year
 JFB: Mac
 pb4: Revenge for COTC
 eulerscheZahl: as in: none at all
 Nerchio: some recalcs already finished and mine is still like 15% does it mean the system believes in me? :D
 eulerscheZahl: why revenge? agade didn't do anything to you
 lifetimeLearner007: top 2 are so close
 pb4: In COTC&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i was at OOC :D
 eulerscheZahl: the other ocean game
 eulerscheZahl: wait, you won that
 pb4: for 50% of the rerun we were at 0.00 score difference
 eulerscheZahl: i remember, close one between #2 and #3
 pb4: Very very very close
 pb4: I was ahead until the very last match
 pb4: ....
 eulerscheZahl: then agade got unlucky at WW
 pb4: Don't remember that
 WINWINWIN: Congrats PB4, 3rd contest win&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's decided now. congrats, well played!
 eulerscheZahl: and reCurse still shown as online, already getting morning for him
 rockstar555: C0ngrats PB4
 dreadylein: Grats to all the winners&#160;:)
 rockstar555: :smiley:
 XprophEtX: Congrats to all winners! :relaxed:
 pb4: Thanks&#160;:)
 lifetimeLearner007: congrats @pb4, @Agade, and @reCurse
 Agade: Ty
 rockstar555: Congrats Agade 
 lifetimeLearner007: and congrats to all the legends...next time, I'll try to reach legend
 eulerscheZahl: well played Agade. nice to see you back
 AntiSquid: that's an old timer top 3, was wondering if it's going to end up like that&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: (account age ofc)
 eulerscheZahl: same top 3 as on CotC, reverse order
 Guinsoo: Do you guys write all your code in the CG ide
 Guinsoo: It gets messy
 eulerscheZahl: of course not. offline IDE
 JFB: Really a bit nostalgic top 3 rank 
 eulerscheZahl: and different files that we merge with a script
 DomiKo: ohhh wow
 DomiKo: so close to top5
 Guinsoo: Okay I'll look into it, sorry I'm quite new
 AntiSquid: i used VSC, but later stuck to the IDE to check for timeouts Guinsoo
 pedrosorio: when do submissions reopen?
 JFB: An eulerscheZahl it looks that tsheert for you&#160;:-)
 DomiKo: 0.02 nice
 eulerscheZahl: wait for wala
 eulerscheZahl: i have a horrible winrate
 karliso: Did you like this game?
 eulerscheZahl: not that much tbh
 eulerscheZahl: little interaction, felt random sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: you can lose the game with a single bad action that only turns out to be bad later
 Astrobytes: Yeah, almost no point in having an opponent
 karliso: yeah. similar to pac in that regard
 AntiSquid: i didn't dislike it, could have practiced a bit more searching / simulations but timeouts where a huge turnoff
 DomiKo: felt more random than pac
 eulerscheZahl: but here it was more obvious what to do than PAC
 eulerscheZahl: so we have less skill variation for bot
 eulerscheZahl: s
 DomiKo: everybody have really similiar tactic
 eulerscheZahl: and hard for me as a human to analyze a replay
 DomiKo: and a "magic values" in eval matter&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: so I liked pacman more
 AntiSquid: they forced interaction with opponent with the 6 brew limit
 DomiKo: not really
 mzbear: i wrote all my code in the web ide, and it was horrible.  started late, ran out of time, and only in the very end i got a somewhat interesting idea that i didn't have time to take to the end
 AntiSquid: yes because it matters if you end it before opponent can do his 6th 
 eulerscheZahl: 4 still computing. 3x java
 DomiKo: I didn't care about opponent at all, and go to top5 
 eulerscheZahl: coincidence or does CG take longer to start a java?
 eulerscheZahl: now 3 out of 3 in java
 dbdr: they might use the 1s more
 AntiSquid: 1 brew makes a world of difference regardless of your rank domiko
 dbdr: wow, DomiKo ignores opponent totally? :O
 DomiKo: I'm only saying that one of my programs played solo game, and win rate wasn't affected that much
 DomiKo: dbdr right now no
 eulerscheZahl: but you detected the end of game?
 DomiKo: but I was
 dbdr: ok
 DomiKo: right know I only dettect if i can brew 6th potion
 DomiKo: but ithout it
 DomiKo: I had same winrates
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know when you have to hurry before the opponent ends the game?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: I don't care
 eulerscheZahl: wow
 Rounddice: I tried to detect whether an opponent can brew a recipe before me, but it made my winrate worse...
 DomiKo: true
 DomiKo: because you can make every potion in 5 turns
 eulerscheZahl: i also failed with that opponent brew
 eulerscheZahl: but at least the end of game felt mandatory to me
 dbdr: everyone did :D
 pedrosorio: Rounddice same here, avoiding recipes my opponent can reach first just made my bot worse - but endgame prediction worked
 eulerscheZahl: i'm afk-ing a bit
 jrke: endgame predictor&#160;??
 AntiSquid: ya jrke, to see who gets a 6th potion first
 jrke: by minimax?
 MichalOp: I anticipate what opponent will do using the same beam search with less time given to it, and do full minmax if someone has 5 potions, both seemed to improve performance a bit
 jrke: all recalc ended
 AntiSquid: just counting distance to next potion when either player has 5 potions
 jrke: we have the final leaderboard
 mzbear: this was the basis of my final idea:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://paste.ofcode.org/zRfUfRKdCH8hLWYD622Sff">https://paste.ofcode.org/zRfUfRKdCH8hLWYD622Sff</a>  ... a lookup table of spells (without rest) for minimum distance to brew.  the next step would've been creation of recipe+recipe tables in a similar fashion by looping through all possible pivot points, and then dynamic programming to make all paths for 5 recipes.  viable? not 100% sure, but it looked promising
 jrke: ah got it 
 DomiKo: Wroc≈Çaw 3rd win! :D
 AntiSquid: let's all enlist there
 AntiSquid: i'll be domiko's desk mate
 Nerchio: :joy:
 jrke: mzbear don't you use 'using namespace std;'
 Nerchio: i don't think they enlist people from silver antisquid
 Nerchio:&#160;;)
 JFB: And the winner is ..... eulerscheZahl (last t-shirt)
 mzbear: uint64_t is enough to contain a mask of viable spells, and then a pathfinder can be built around that to only test the best spells at each inventory position
 eulerscheZahl: :shirt:
 DomiKo: nice one!
 Nerchio: gratz euler
 mzbear: jrke: nope, i never do&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, didn't even expect it anymore&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: well done&#160;:)
 LordSkaven: well done everyone who competed, looking forward to the post mortems
 AntiSquid: lol Nerchio thanks for rubbing it in, but i spent least time on this one&#160;:/
 DomiKo: I can't wait to read pb4's postmodern
 eulerscheZahl: inb4 10 versions of "i wrote a beam search"
 Nerchio: haha i thought I needed to counter the jab against Wroclaw signing everyone :D
 eulerscheZahl: pb did some interesting stuff
 DomiKo: I know
 DomiKo: I tried to copy his eval of spells
 AntiSquid: i wrote a beam search too, although i didn't mention it on forums eulerscheZahl
 jrke: my current submitted code is beam searcg
 DomiKo: I made 40 games with same choiced of cards :joy:
 Nerchio: yeah i will probably not write a post mortem since i am 76th :D
 AntiSquid: ah, well you can move uni Nerchio
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/V47Aru6">https://imgur.com/a/V47Aru6</a>
 AntiSquid: people had spell evals like in LOCM afterall? lol
 eulerscheZahl: pb extracted more than me
 AntiSquid: i was considering it but thought it's not relevant
 Guinsoo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/143463c9-9e8a-43bd-aca6-6f8414693eb5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/143463c9-9e8a-43bd-aca6-6f8414693eb5</a>
 Guinsoo: Lol
 AntiSquid: nvm i do have a formula in there, but it's very basic, sharing on forums
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/uaF7VcB3">https://pastebin.com/uaF7VcB3</a>
 Nerchio: i kind of expected spells that produce a lot of ingredients to rank low
 Nerchio: but i think my eval was the opposite lol
 AntiSquid: i mean if you're serious about it, wouldn't spell scores be dependent on what you already learned&#160;?
 AntiSquid: if you have 2 blue -&gt; 2 green then 2 green -&gt; 2 orange matters a lot more 
 Nerchio: well beginning of the game you usually buy spells anyway
 Nerchio: so you want general 'good' spells
 Nerchio: but balancing your spell inventory is probably quite important too
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up on the latter
 eulerscheZahl: =&gt; wait for pb's post mortem here
 Nerchio: why is it so hard to find link to post mortems :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/</a>
 Nerchio: thanks i closed it and couldnt find
 eulerscheZahl: they are just not there yet
 AntiSquid: yes Nerchio, but there was also the issue of getting better spells and giving more blues to the opponent 
 Nerchio: yeah thats why my bot ended up with 7 spells for free
 Nerchio: in the end
 Nerchio: it was easy to randomly lose at the start by feeding your opponent
 Nerchio: but its the first time i worked with bot which basically only part was search
 Nerchio: tuning it was kind of a pain since you cant see direct results
 Nerchio: you need to look at many games and win ratios
 BoBot: from PMs it looks like the basic ideas/principles are similar - something I did not pay attention to, was how many resources you have left after casting - I did have some points for ingredients in eval, but I think that was strongly outdone by brew eval
 mzbear: my biggest mistake was sticking to the web editor instead of working locally .. i started the challenge late and didn't want to "waste time" setting up a local referee.  in the end, it was impossible to figure out what changes were an improvement&#160;:(
 BoBot: oh, I was very happy with how I organized my coding this time - I found a good library for combining Python scripts, so I could work with several files, also I used unittests way more than ever before for a CG contest
 BoBot: that worked for basic logic at least, once I got deeper I stopped creating tests - and that might have hurt my progress actually :P&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl you got into the cut gz :O
 DomiKo: forum down?
 ZarthaxX: im viewing it
 DomiKo:&#160;:/

 Nerchio: .
 DomiKo: I messed up
 DomiKo: I preseed reply button 
 DomiKo: and ehhh...
 ZarthaxX: wait, wasnt there a run of the game?
 ZarthaxX: there was right?
 AntiSquid: recalc you mean? there was
 ZarthaxX: yeah that
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 DomiKo: I always have to press wrong button wrrrr
 WINWINWIN: They removes emil. from the leaderboard?
 WINWINWIN: *removed
 special_agent: guy why my account showing N/A in contest view repport&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Did you delete and reactivate your account or something like that?
 AntiSquid: hey domiko i delete your second post, you double posted due to a bug or whatever
 DomiKo: ok
 DomiKo: OHHHH
 DomiKo: I see now
 special_agent: no i did not do anything to my account 
 DomiKo: I pressed delete button on first one
 DomiKo: So I can't see my first post&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: shit
 AntiSquid: wait
 DomiKo: I got "too many request" error
 WINWINWIN: I`m not sure what happened special_agent, ask the [CG] team. But dont spam themm.
 DomiKo: and someting went wrong
 AntiSquid: you deleted the first one with the likes on it&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i restored the second one
 DomiKo: :sob::sob::sob:

 WINWINWIN: Any idea what happened to him, Squid?
 AntiSquid: uhm yes but i'd rather not say it in chat
 WINWINWIN: Ohh... got it.
 Clagus: :scream:
 special_agent: AntiSquid please dm me 
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN i went up in rank from 808 to 802 so 6 bots removed above me
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, I just checked, total is now 7036 from 7045
 WINWINWIN: So excluding emil. 8 removed
 eulerscheZahl: damn, i wanted to take a snapshot to see who got removed
 ZarthaxX: 7035*

 ZarthaxX: wtf
 Zanoshky: anyone from the top wish to share code?
 Zanoshky: would love to learn and improve myself
 darkhorse64: Copy/pasting is really the least effort
 ntroPi: the game will be an opten bot competition, so sharing full code is ... not optimal?
 ntroPi: *open
 ZarthaxX: yep
 AntiSquid: Zanoshky not a website where people share or where it's encouraged. Actually discouraged.
 Zanoshky: sorry did not know
 AntiSquid: it's ok
 ntroPi: There will be post mortem blogposts about used strategies though. So plenty to learn.
 WINWINWIN: Special agent had an alt which he used for testing, he has just joined and didnt know the rules, can anything be done?
 darkhorse64: Sharing knowledge is encouraged. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/</a>
 AntiSquid: kaggle is in the other extreme though, people actively share during contest and you got to take top code and improve it unless you got top notebook yourself Zanoshky
 eulerscheZahl: CG decisions are final
 WINWINWIN: Ok.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/rules">https://www.codingame.com/rules</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can politely ask Thibaud but don't expect anything from it
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN those with alt (there were a few) last contest were lucky to dodge the removal
 WINWINWIN: last contest alts were allowed?
 AntiSquid: also alts are never allowed according to Thibaud so use at own risk .
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud removed alts but showed mercy to the main accounts
 AntiSquid: no WINWINWIN they were removed, but let mains stay
 WINWINWIN: Oh, understood.
 WINWINWIN: But why bother with alts? No shame in trying a bad submit...
 AntiSquid: but still wish there was a way to self-demote to wood especially during contest when you want to try a new approach 
 rockstar555: how to became a moderator
 AntiSquid: everyone approaches progression on ladder differently 
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 WINWINWIN: Oh, yeah. to start from basic rules.
 AntiSquid: yes
 DomiKo: pb4 is repylng!
 DomiKo: here we go!
 AntiSquid: record it
 DomiKo: posted!
 DomiKo: lets read
 pb4: Not the PM yet :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 WINWINWIN: You got their hopes up :D
 WINWINWIN: *our
 DomiKo: You got me
 DomiKo: I'm so hyped
 pb4: Should I delete&#160;? :innocent:
 DomiKo: I have SS's
 eulerscheZahl: you changed the scores
 eulerscheZahl: 513 =&gt; 514 for me
 pb4: Good for you then :D
 eulerscheZahl: rounding errors?
 pb4: It's based on a numerical solver, maybe you were right on the edge&#160;?
 pb4: oh I excluded emil in the last calculation
 eulerscheZahl: poor emil
 pb4: Could have changed somebody else's score, which changed yours in turn
 AntiSquid: RIP email. best member
 AntiSquid: why is Jeff06 at 0&#160;?
 pb4: Had to pick a value to normalize
 pb4: so... last at 0
 MenoIy: euh there was someone ahead of me in the leader  and I don't see him anymore  is there still match in gold&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: No, the guys with alternate accounts are being removed.
 MenoIy: alternate  ?
 MadKnight: multiple
 WINWINWIN: Spare accounts, for testing.
 MenoIy: ah niiice
 ntroPi: multi account is forbidden - some people did it anywas.
 MenoIy: so they check the code if it s same&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MenoIy: Nice 
 pedrosorio: I see more than one person saying the used inventory in their eval function with:tier0 + 2*tier1 + 3*tier2 + 4*tier3
 eulerscheZahl: afaik they only check gold+legend
 MenoIy: I hop more poeple drop Jk Xd
 WINWINWIN: They probably have some script to check everything
 ntroPi: Thats the formula to calculate potion value.
 ntroPi: (plus one extra rule)
 AntiSquid: mine was based on rounds it takes to get the ingredient with the starting spells pedrosorio
 AntiSquid: i guess they ignored the resting turn for their scoring
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/509677309">https://www.codingame.com/replay/509677309</a>safe bet that you will climb
 eulerscheZahl: but ranking was stable in this case. just 6 spots apart
 Westicles: They both used the ETSI standard for comments
 AntiSquid: which is why i imagine the scores would drastically change as you acquire new spells, not sure how to evaluate it in that case
 WINWINWIN: ETSI?
 Illedan: Is the multi open yet?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Westicles: European Telecommunications Standards Institute
 karliso: Poor guy. There are probably people doing worse things than that.
 Illedan: Nice tshirt rank euler :D
 BrunoFelthes: Will moderator win t-shirts?
 Illedan: Sure
 WINWINWIN: 7035 now, one more guy gone.
 eulerscheZahl: thanks illedan
 eulerscheZahl: why not BrunoFelthes?
 eulerscheZahl: shall i be punished for doing some voluntary work for CG?
 BrunoFelthes: I'm 24th
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't know the game before, same chances for everyone
 dbdr: erichto knew it before
 eulerscheZahl: true
 BrunoFelthes: Was you not a beta tester for the gamer euler?
 dbdr: not sure how much and what was the deal
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: knew what? 
 eulerscheZahl: that's purely a CG created contest
 BrunoFelthes: I just want a t-shirt&#160;:(
 dbdr: erichto had a video showing the game when it opened
 eulerscheZahl: you have one already
 eulerscheZahl: locam, do you remember?
 BrunoFelthes: yes
 AntiSquid: i think they just contacted him for the streaming part that's it .
 BrunoFelthes: it was so close... congrats euler
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. was on a coin flip
 dbdr: sure, but so he had access in advance
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/28">https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/28</a>in that ranking i'm below the line (but so are you)
 Astrobytes: maybe on the day only dbdr? Either way, didn't help his rank :P
 BrunoFelthes: I position below
 AntiSquid: that's a 3.5 hour bot Astrobytes 
 dbdr: yes, not complaining&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think he ever planned to really try the contest. just some streaming
 eulerscheZahl: which was nice, extra exposure for CG
 Astrobytes: He usually streams contests now, at least once or twice
 Nerchio: well he probably got paid for it
 Nerchio: since he seemed to spend quite some time on it
 DomiKo: CG is growing and that's important
 eulerscheZahl: i bet against. probably a tshirt
 AntiSquid: doubt he got paid for some streaming
 Nerchio: it's advertisement and not a bad one, doesnt need to be paid a lot tbh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't think he'd be paid. But yeah, more exposure is always good
 eulerscheZahl: i know illedan got a tshirt for streaming in the past. so i see it realistic that errichto got one as well
 eulerscheZahl: but that's all
 DomiKo: Is there any photo of CG T-shirt?
 Nerchio: ok you guys know CG better than me :P but I would imagine something specific like this would consider as paid advertisement

 AntiSquid: he had an interesting DP bot, nobody mentioned DP regarding their bot here, guess it's not feasible at all on CG&#160;?
 AntiSquid:  BAN&#160;!
 Astrobytes: thanks for that euler
 eulerscheZahl: old one, no longer available. and i never managed to win it&#160;:(

 DomiKo: we can choose TShirt?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 DomiKo: O.o
 eulerscheZahl: you get a link to an online shop
 eulerscheZahl: enter size, address
 AntiSquid: gratz on shirt domiko
 eulerscheZahl: just no payment
 DomiKo: thank AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: was about time that you get one&#160;;)

 eulerscheZahl: but i like the canvas more. something collectible, nothing you buy in a shop
 AntiSquid: also different funding system 
 WINWINWIN: I just want the T Shirt&#160;:( It shall be mine in the spring challenge!
 Nerchio: true bot top3 is a little bit harder than top20 :D
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: once i was close&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: you could get the address of the shop the canvases are made at and order a custom made one with whatever text you want euler :D
 Nerchio: this time looks like there was a lot of strong players
 WINWINWIN: It has to be won.
 eulerscheZahl: that's not the same AntiSquid :D
 AntiSquid: someone got a CG shirt for their baby
 AntiSquid: so .. i mean the contest isn't so much about the prizes
 eulerscheZahl: this time there were 7k players. odds are good that some of the new ones are strong
 dbdr: #5 is lvl 8
 AntiSquid: odds are some are even better since, some are new / just getting started, not everyone has same amount of time
 Nerchio: im glad i got legend so i dont have to come back to the game anymore
 WINWINWIN: Karliso, experimenting with avatars?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, look at karliso's new profile pic :D
 Nerchio: i want to slowly fill my profile with legend :D
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 karliso: you like it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: who recognizes where it's from?

 WINWINWIN: What do you think AutomatonNN&gt;
 AutomatonNN: I was talking about the polar bear
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX

 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: the bot :rofl:
 WINWINWIN: I like AutomatonNN&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: good idea

 AntiSquid: NN
 AntiSquid: ah just noticed your pokeball WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: pokeball?
 WINWINWIN: What Pokeball?
 AntiSquid: the pokeball icon moderators have
 WINWINWIN: Yes&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you catch pokemans in chat but never release them in the wild, that pokeball
 struct: oh well
 WINWINWIN: :P Rockstar555 and rodrigo are among those Pokemon
 struct: just woke up
 eulerscheZahl: you banned them?
 struct: rank 120 doesnt seem bad
 WINWINWIN: I didnt, I` not sure how to.
 ZarthaxX: gz struct&#160;:)
 struct: ty ZarthaxX
 WINWINWIN: *I`m
 struct: and ty for the help too, on suggestions
 eulerscheZahl: write "/ban username"
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still at 0 bans&#160;:)
 DomiKo: we will get CP from contest at night?
 WINWINWIN: Got it, andd to kick, its /kick?
 eulerscheZahl: but some kicks
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AntiSquid: yes
 WINWINWIN: Thanks&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: Morning CG
 AntiSquid: 9922 CP for you DomiKo
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo this night or next probably. sometimes it takes a bit
 AntiSquid: struct 8557 CP
 Illedan: Wow, karlis o changed his avatar? :O
 DomiKo: I can't wait for multi
 AntiSquid: 10000^((7035-120+1)/7035)
 DomiKo: I will break 100K CP
 struct: 8557 is nice
 eulerscheZahl: do you recognize it Illedan?
 ZarthaxX: struct i didnt do anything but ok :P
 Illedan: Ofc
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the original was red
 DomiKo: :joy:
 struct: 8557 is almost 7 times of what i currently have from all contests combined lol
 Illedan: Very good game which got me through some boring days in Sri Lanka :P 
 eulerscheZahl: i tried with gimp and then wrote a script to make it blue
 AntiSquid: it goes down by 500 every contest struct
 struct: I dont think i ever took a contest so seriously
 Illedan: I wonder how they managed to set the date 6th of May already :thinking:
 struct: next time ill "start" day 1
 AntiSquid: placeholder for sure
 AntiSquid: select a date and go with it
 Illedan: Last time they didn't set a set date
 AntiSquid: then postpone as needed
 Illedan: Hope not
 Illedan: I'll plan next year around that date
 AntiSquid: didn't they set a date for sept last year or so and then postponed to spring this year&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: I hope it does get postponed a bit... exams then&#160;:(
 Oliverboi420: ye
 pedrosorio: I'd like to see what rank the bot I had 24h ago would have achieved, before I drunkenly submitted a lame version right before the end of the contest xD
 Majeck: When will the codinpoints for the contest be updated? in 24 hours?
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know. usually 1 or 2 days
 Majeck: Also, how long ago did the contest end? All I knew was that it ended in monday :P
 eulerscheZahl: 4h 42min ago
 ATaco: I only just started it today, got through to wood 1, then it ended.

 ATaco: Was a shame, spent a few hours thinking about it
 eulerscheZahl: the game will come back in the multiplayer section
 eulerscheZahl: probably in 1 or 2 days as well
 AntiSquid: you joined about 10 days too late ATaco
 eulerscheZahl: will appear at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 MSmits: hey euler what rank did you get?
 eulerscheZahl: 20 \o/
 eulerscheZahl: we missed you&#160;:(
 MSmits: thats very good
 struct: grats
 ATaco: Still enjoyed fiddling with it.
 MSmits: yeah it sucks, but i had no time
 ATaco: I was sure the concept was easy until the layers started adding on
 AntiSquid: there are lots of other games 
 MSmits: I could have started on saturday for a 2 day rush till monday, but too tired
 eulerscheZahl: i think you would have liked that param tuning contest
 ATaco: (I was quick to destroy the time limit :P)
 DomiKo: Euler I will share my inventory too
 DomiKo: :D

 AntiSquid: Oliverboi420 i was about to ban . no racial slurs of any kind .
 miszu: I would like to know how simple person I am
 eulerscheZahl: yes, next is ban for sure
 AntiSquid: not even the cracker one .
 miszu: what happened?
 eulerscheZahl: racial insult
 miszu: the N word? :O
 miszu: oh my...
 DomiKo: Euler are you ready?
 eulerscheZahl: for your post mortem? yes
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits "I reached #43 legend using smitsimax"
 DomiKo: for my one trick
 eulerscheZahl: my code formatting is better for sure :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you edited
 DomiKo: 4 ` insted of 3
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 LordSkaven: yep, my brain is broken after reading eulers and DomiKo's post mortems. Very smart ideas, dont understand them one bit yet
 MSmits: wait eulerscheZahl, you used smitsimax?&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/42">https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/42</a>
 DomiKo: Euler you like it?
 eulerscheZahl: let me read
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: yeah i was more thinking about DUCT
 MSmits: because the possible moves are interrelated
 eulerscheZahl: repeatable looks nice
 DomiKo: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: i just generated a state with the spell applied once
 WINWINWIN: DUCT?
 eulerscheZahl: and then applied the spell again to that new state
 MSmits: decoupled uct
 MSmits: two different trees, but joined gamestates
 MSmits: a lot more branching than smitsimax
 MSmits: because it's state-coherent
 MadKnight: DUCT but extra branching only if enemy move affects u
 pb4: who used DUCT&#160;?
 miszu: most people use beam search. I need to read about this algorithm
 MSmits: i was saying thats what i would have tried
 MSmits: pb4
 miszu: never heard of it in my AI class
 MSmits: if i had time
 pb4:&#160;:)
 pb4: I used double DUCT :D
 MSmits: whats double duct?
 MadKnight: miszu it's like BFS but with n best nodes instead of all
 MadKnight: DDUCT&#160;?
 pb4: DUCT for draft phase
 AntiSquid: but i don't see why he used smitsimax
 pb4: DUCT for endgame
 MSmits: ahh ok
 pb4: BS in the middle
 MSmits: sounds good yeah
 wlesavo: euler gratz with t-shirt, i missed the end of recalc :slight_smile:
 MSmits: I'll join next contest for sure
 MSmits: at least i wont be moving or stuck trying to create an AI course from scratch
 MSmits: in weeks
 eulerscheZahl: thanks wlesavo. was really close. dropped from 15 to 22 and back up on the roller coaster
 miszu: why beam search vs bfs?
 eulerscheZahl: to go deeper
 miszu: all you care is the best move
 eulerscheZahl: but what's the best move?
 eulerscheZahl: if you finish a potion now, you have no ingredients left for the next
 eulerscheZahl: reloading them takes some turns you don't want to waste
 wlesavo: yeah, i saw you droping out of top 20 and then had to go
 miszu: eulerscheZahl yeah but you need to reload inventories anyways
 struct: well if you have more ingredients after brewing
 eulerscheZahl: with a half-full inventory you can use better spells to reload the rest
 struct: you can reload faster
 eulerscheZahl: repeatable spells
 miszu: in bfs, you don't need to stop right after brewing a spell
 miszu: you could go deeper no?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: state count just explodes at some point
 struct: but with beam you prune the worst nodes
 eulerscheZahl: and some paths are obviously stupid
 miszu: onvious :D
 struct: I was getting like depth 14 with width of 6500?
 eulerscheZahl: so you remove the garbage early to have a cluser look at the rest
 AntiSquid: didn't you prune equal states?
 eulerscheZahl: of course we did
 miszu: in bfs you can't prume easilly as in beam?
 struct: or more cant really recall
 eulerscheZahl: unordered_set
 dbdr: bfs with pruning = beam
 AntiSquid: i forced it to stay at 1001 max 
 miszu: ohh
 struct: can  i post the beam part here to see if its right?
 struct: it has really no evaluation and stuff like that
 struct: that shows on the code*
 dbdr: sure
 AntiSquid: if it goes over you might have a bug really, i checked mine when it went over was counting extra possible stated going into 11-14 gems total so ...

 eulerscheZahl: oh, you were faster because i did a little cleanup
 struct: State* Agent::pool = new State[1000000];State** Agent::queue = new State*[1000000]();
 WINWINWIN: looks like they stopped kicking in the contest now. Rankings are final.
 eulerscheZahl: huh? there are some kicks missing?
 struct: thanks for sharing euler
 dbdr: struct: you're not removing duplicates?
 struct: no
 dbdr: that's a huge impact
 struct: I "did not have time "
 dbdr: ok
 WINWINWIN: Kicks are over in the contest...
 [CG]SaiksyApo: No they are not.
 eulerscheZahl: you will find some more&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: also congrats on reaching legend [CG]SaiksyApo
 eulerscheZahl: did you break your bot in the end? i even saw you a bit above me this morning
 miszu: man I feel stupid now haha
 miszu: beamsearch is not something so fancy
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Won't keep an bugged AI so I fixed the known bug and made it worst :p
 Astrobytes: lol, classic
 dbdr: struct: what do you do with best?
 dbdr: is that how to pick your action?
 struct: yes, I store the first action id in the state
 struct: and then just increase by 1
 struct: first action that started that state
 struct: so origin
 player_one: I've noticed that my bots tend to get "entrenched" if I don't resubmit for a while.
 struct: not the parent, but the parent of all I guess
 dbdr: so you don't actually pick the best action/state
 player_one: I didn't do anything for about 5 days, and mine was sitting at about 16th in Silver last night.
 miszu: but hold on, you need a good heuristics for beam search. It is difficult to find good heuristic
 struct: dbdr how should I have done it?
 player_one: I then spent an hour or so improving it, and couldn't get above 100 in Silver, even though I know it was better!&#160;:-)
 struct: eval just the best state?
 dbdr: pool[0].actionId
 dbdr: that would be a pure beam search
 Maciulis: so whole state is added to unordered set or just inv deltas after casts?  
 meh1001: I used A* with the.. euclidian distance? as the heuristic
 dbdr: pool[start].actionId
 dbdr: you get the idea
 meh1001: it wasn't great
 struct: I see, thanks
 dbdr: I mean what you do has some kind of sense. but you don't even consider the order inside the beam
 dbdr: just what is inside or outside the beem
 miszu: 1993/7035. Top 2000 I am happy
 eulerscheZahl: "After REST, in the next turn only the ‚Äòunlocked‚Äô spells are available"some clever pruning from valcodi. how could I miss that?
 miszu: eulerscheZahl why is that good pruning?
 dbdr: ah yes, makes sense
 miszu: you are missing lots of states
 dbdr: ideally the beam would take care of it anyways
 eulerscheZahl: why should you REST and then not do anything with that action
 player_one: No. That's brilliant.
 eulerscheZahl: sure, beam handles it. after some non-optimal states
 dbdr: actually, I do REST - BREW sometimes
 miszu: oh makes sense yeah
 player_one: I only checked for BREW after CAST.
 dbdr: if I'm sure the opp will not brew it
 eulerscheZahl: that rest-brew only makes sense if you predict the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: opp: i'll do that #3 potion
 dbdr: easy to do depth 2
 struct: it makes a lot of sense if you predict
 eulerscheZahl: you: i want that +1. but it will be a #3 soon
 eulerscheZahl: +3, not #3
 struct: since you will have all spells ready when the net potion shows up
 dbdr: yes, that's why I wait
 dbdr: in case the price goes up&#160;:)
 player_one: Got it. Yeah, I ignored bonuses. Out of scope for me.&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: i ignored them too
 JohnCM: where's the forum to post strats for this?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/</a>
 JohnCM: ok
 eulerscheZahl: 47 posts to read already
 BrunoFelthes: 429 Too Many Requests
 eulerscheZahl: right
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/546f2787-3b75-4fb4-bee5-eb201d115694">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/546f2787-3b75-4fb4-bee5-eb201d115694</a>
 player_one: Prioritize and limit, yes.
 SirLoxley: How much does this bit shift hackery gain in terms of compute time? I used regular ints, and sometimes even Strings
 CowZow: I see thanks
 player_one: It's going to depend on the language, SirLokley.
 eulerscheZahl: strings usually cost you quite a lot
 player_one: If you want to compare in your language, I recommend you time some simple loops using different techniques.
 SirLoxley: My chosen runtime was Java/jvm. Well Strings I used mainly as keys for Hashtables
 JRFerguson: euler
 eulerscheZahl: JRFerguson
 SirLoxley: Next time I swear I use Rust.Spring I used C++ and hated it. Java is ok-ish but with all that memory allocation happening for you ... not good in real hard time situations
 Nerchio: true
 Nerchio: i might be trying Rust as well
 Nerchio: we will see :D
 eulerscheZahl: not every contest is as CPU heavy as this one
 dbdr: but most are
 eulerscheZahl: there have been some with python in top3
 dbdr: let's say many are, and in all it helps
 Nerchio: but it would be nice if i didn't have to start optimizing before i sit down to strategy so to speak
 eulerscheZahl: that was extreme in this one
 Nerchio: 'strategy' matters only so much when you can reach depth 3 or 4
 eulerscheZahl: you need a lot of sims to feed the beam search at get results where param tuning makes sense
 dbdr: true, though I think at some level perf was enough, it did not make the difference
 struct: multi available
 Nerchio: so yeah i used a bitset in java for the first time and i enjoyed it quite a bit
 struct: oh not yet
 eulerscheZahl: really?
 dbdr: people reached depth 35
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/KcoscnT.png">https://i.imgur.com/KcoscnT.png</a>
 Nerchio: i think if you do it well it's not a much bigger mess with nicer performance
 eulerscheZahl: fair warning for kick next time&#160;;)
 dbdr: don't need to go deeper :D
 CowZow: eulerschezahl - your bitwise trick for the inventories was too clever PogChamp
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020-fall">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020-fall</a>
 dbdr: esp with beam
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 struct: ah no
 JRFerguson: i don't quite get the beam search
 struct: link doesnt work
 JRFerguson: can anyone share a resource about it&#160;?
 dbdr: perf might distinguish mid gold from legend, more than mid legend to top legend
 eulerscheZahl: did you read this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/546f2787-3b75-4fb4-bee5-eb201d115694">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/546f2787-3b75-4fb4-bee5-eb201d115694</a>
 eulerscheZahl: @JRFerguson
 eulerscheZahl: assume width = BeamWidthi screwed up trimming my snippet
 Nerchio: ^ java would explode if i did this
 eulerscheZahl: i did that in C#
 eulerscheZahl: and then converted to C++
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if it was necessary in hindsight
 eulerscheZahl: given the close #20 i'd like to think that it was
 Nerchio: maybe if you spent time rewriting on your C# bot it would be better
 struct: oh they removed the box from home page&#160;:(
 Nerchio: high placement of Wala in java also makes me thing you could reach higher with C#
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 Nerchio: even though java is quite slow compared to C++ i underestimated the possibilities
 Nerchio: that you can do in this contest
 JRFerguson: mmm, thanks eulsr
 JRFerguson: euler
 Nerchio: that's why im impressed with non C++ languages reaching higher spots :P
 JRFerguson: i think i got it
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 dbdr: nice reference implementation
 JohnCM: ok i shared my strat there
 struct: states = next.OrderByDescending(n =&gt; n.HeuristicScore).ToList();
 struct: so if I understand right
 eulerscheZahl: that speed efficiency right there :D
 struct: at the end you will pick the best at final depth right?
 struct: and return it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 struct: ok i did it wrong like dbd said
 eulerscheZahl: how did yours even work? :D
 Nerchio: i liked the comment somebody wrote where they picked the most common starting move from 20 best 
 eulerscheZahl: now you know what to test in multi
 struct: if i get legend with that change
 struct: i delete
 eulerscheZahl: you did right and i did wrong. don't delete
 dbdr: it does some kind of vote on actions that lead to stay inside the beam
 dbdr: it's not completely meaningless
 dbdr: just not using all the information
 dbdr: it might be more robust in a way, if the best path gets blocked
 struct: I dont read the papers and then I come up with these implementations...
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i did for MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: but i think i understood it and got it right
 eulerscheZahl: then implemented an MCTS solver without readin the paper :D
 eulerscheZahl: seems to work. managed to make a colleague from work rage when playing connect4 against it
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: "why does that idiot tell my that i lost?"10 turns later...
 JRFerguson: how do you score a rest action&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no special score
 JohnCM: the score depends on the later actions you do
 JohnCM: but it opens up possibilities for more spells
 JRFerguson: when does the beam search think it is a good choice&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you reward with later spells that you apply
 eulerscheZahl: oh and i slightly reward having a spell available
 JohnCM: i realized the more heuristics i do to hardcore the actions, the worse it performs
 JohnCM: so i just let the bfs do its job
 JohnCM: hardcode*
 JRFerguson: as i understand, you evaluate all the nodes at a certain depth
 JRFerguson: and keep the best N
 JRFerguson: 1200 in your case euler
 eulerscheZahl: beam is wide enough. when the start leading to the REST is good, it won't get pruned instantly
 eulerscheZahl: so even a bad REST can keep you in best N
 JRFerguson: ok
 wlesavo: euler dont you mind sharing your hash function for educational reasons? :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i should then specify how i store my spells
 eulerscheZahl: int64 for active, another one for exhausted
 struct: I stored mine on u64
 struct: same
 Nerchio: i didn't know how to do the hash function so i was pruning by score :P
 eulerscheZahl: REST: active |= exhausted; exhausted = 0
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5aa591b7-a73d-47c4-b137-a7db3d639d8b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5aa591b7-a73d-47c4-b137-a7db3d639d8b</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the spell bits will overflow in that hash eventually
 eulerscheZahl: but i start filling at the least significant bit
 eulerscheZahl: so it's fine unless the opponent spams LEARN
 struct: active is the same as learned right?
 wlesavo: oh also, i thought to store in int64, but how you check if particular spell is active or not for this state?
 eulerscheZahl: learned  =active | exhausted
 eulerscheZahl: and the last 6 bit are the tome
 eulerscheZahl: for a score lookup of my currently learnt spells
 struct: ah ok i had learned and exhausted
 eulerscheZahl: scoreLookup[(active|exhausted)&amp;0X3F]
 dbdr: oh, you precalc the score? nice
 eulerscheZahl: only 64 combos
 dbdr: yeah, that allows for complex scoring if you want to
 eulerscheZahl: i did. and then discarded&#160;:(
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f228a14-b047-4f18-b076-5ca7e1c09c6c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f228a14-b047-4f18-b076-5ca7e1c09c6c</a>
 dbdr: yeah, it's hard/dangerous to be clever :D
 Astrobytes: wow, it's available in multi already
 eulerscheZahl: similar to my iterating
 eulerscheZahl: even C# has a PopCount
 dbdr: ERROR 404
 JohnCM: i think i can hit legend for this comp if i finetune my bot a little
 wlesavo: i feel dumb reading this code
 eulerscheZahl: tried to access the multi dbdr?
 JohnCM: it was alr beating gold pretty frequently
 Astrobytes: I'm looking at my code in the IDE
 dbdr: yes
 JohnCM: a pity i reached gold late. the silver boss was too tough
 struct: wlesavo popcount counts number of set bits
 struct: __builtin_ctzl returns the first bit index from left?
 eulerscheZahl: while (__builtin_popcountl(mask))
 eulerscheZahl: while (mask)
 struct: mask &amp;= set the bit to 0
 eulerscheZahl: how about that?
 struct: oh right
 wlesavo: ok i have to read about masks
 eulerscheZahl: i bitboarded my hypersonic, that was a beast
 dbdr: 1 year of covid and you don't know about masks?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Uljahn: :smiley:
 Nerchio: only pokeballs in this chat
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: are you scared?
 wlesavo: dbdr apparently not enough :smiley:
 Nerchio: i was using beam search with 400 nodes and i see people were using like 1.2k
 Nerchio: feelsbad
 Astrobytes: some eager beavers already resubmitting
 dbdr: Nerchio: don't feel bad, test
 eulerscheZahl: my c# version was at 500 only
 eulerscheZahl: and i didn't gain much
 wlesavo: 0 computing in legend :smirk:
 Nerchio: in the end i finished with 400 depth 0 and +50 each depth
 JohnCM: i haven't seen any legend python share their strats yet
 JohnCM: would be interesting to see how python works
 NitMpez: has any pm's been posted yet
 NitMpez: was curious what i messed up :P
 Astrobytes: yeah, loads
 cegprakash: link plz

 eulerscheZahl: is the player deletion finished yet?
 wlesavo: wtf nercio you submit broke my rank ebven though i won a game
 tomatoes: just click forums link :expressionless:
 eulerscheZahl: 7025 remaining
 Astrobytes: Since the multi is out I would think so
 SandmanSW96: hey, in the contests/multis/etc, is there a hotkey for "replay with same conditions"&#160;?

 TwoLate: Siharde is DQ'ed
 pedrosorio: speaking of bitwise operations, I went full retard and stored the whole state in single Java long lol
 Nerchio: that's good
 Nerchio: if you can pull it out
 Nerchio: :D
 Nerchio: pull it off
 BrunoFelthes: eulerscheZahl how do you deal with repeatable spells?
 Nerchio: thats the correct statement :D
 eulerscheZahl: apply again on the result of my first spell cast
 eulerscheZahl: and then patch the parent relation
 dbdr: I do that too. no need to multiply&#160;:)
 pedrosorio: Nerchio, it makes the code messy and harder to iterate, and then I didn't even spend time tweaking the eval function which seems to be the main diff to get to legend
 AshKetchum: euler do yo use std::map or your own map
 dbdr: repeated additions
 Nerchio: pedrosorio true but its quite efficient if you can handle it&#160;:)
 pedrosorio: how do you paste code here?
 Astrobytes: just paste it, it'll auto-pastebin
 eulerscheZahl: unordered_map
 eulerscheZahl: not using my own implementation AshKetchum
 Backtomars: Guys, when you prune equal states, do you consider your spell states?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 pedrosorio: brew, cast, learn functions that update the state bits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2367d1ce-ad76-4755-9c2f-54378f2b95ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2367d1ce-ad76-4755-9c2f-54378f2b95ee</a>
 Backtomars: thanks
 BrunoFelthes: they will release the game today?
 BrunoFelthes: wow
 Nerchio: its up D
 Nerchio: :D
 Nerchio: and you just beat me -_-
 BrunoFelthes: nice... the last contest that i participate, it take days...
 Backtomars: After brewing one potion,should  the states map be cleared for the next brew?
 AntiSquid: so from rank 808 to 801 to 788 O__O that's a lot of deletz
 AntiSquid: need to do a full rewrite 
 AntiSquid: one day ...
 wlesavo: –µ—â–≤—Ñ–Ω —à—ã –µ—Ä—É –≤—Ñ–Ω

 Nerchio: enjoy
 AntiSquid: wear a mask /s
 Nerchio: take some bits with you to protect yourself
 AntiSquid: funny this bugged version is my best one . it has bad enemy prediction, why does it rank 100 places higher?
 JFB: Waw - small change of the parameters, 1st run in arena - and promotion to Legend (+ one more pushed too&#160;;-) So I really can be in Legend in contest. 
 DomiKo: bot programming?
 Nerchio: nice congratz
 JFB: DomiKo - yes
 AntiSquid: lol did you just missed legend JFB&#160;?
 AntiSquid: for contest i mean
 wlesavo: submits are so smuth rn
 JFB: Yes - I finished 2nd in Gold
 AntiSquid: sux
 AntiSquid: all the brutal testers stopped running in the background
 Nerchio: benchmarks if anything :D
 Nerchio: ok my bot is trash
 Nerchio: goodbye bot i will never start it again :D
 JFB: But it is trash from the Legend&#160;;-)

 Alexians: hey all
 Alexians: new newbie, zero experience, trying to find something new to do 
 Alexians: Got into Crypto from coinbase, and wanted to see what else blockchain programming could offer
 AntiSquid: haha
 AntiSquid: that link
 JFB: So it looks that middle of Legend was 1 submit away. C'est la vie 
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 DomiKo: close
 JFB: So may 2021 - next try&#160;;-)
 DomiKo: so legend fell unstable right now
 DomiKo: first submit top50
 DomiKo: second submit top16 right now
 AntiSquid: JFB damn that's some bad luck
 MSmits: hi
 MSmits: chat lagging?
 miszu: qq for MCTS, the uct formula is ln(x) where x = total number of simulations of MCTS or the parent node visits?
 twoeyes: hello! by any chance, is there a way to 'join' previous challenges and try them out?
 twoeyes: nevermind, I JUST found it XD
 DomiKo: hi MSmits :smiley:
 DomiKo: yes its so laggy
 Zenoscave: wow quick turnaround on the multi
 eulerscheZahl: chat is back
 Zenoscave: hi eulerscheZahl
 Zenoscave: where'd you end up?
 eulerscheZahl: 20&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: nice!
 eulerscheZahl: my first CG contest without C#&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: don't worry there's always a chance to redeem&#160;;)
 struct: There is no going back now
 Zenoscave: struct will you delete?
 Zenoscave: you made gold!
 Zenoscave: turns out I could increase my beamwidth by 25% with no depth loss
 Zenoscave: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 struct: delete why?
 Zenoscave: you joked delete if no legend
 Zenoscave: or was it no gold
 struct: no gold
 AntiSquid: i joked about delete if stuck in silver :P
 Zenoscave: well what are you waiting for :P
 geppoz: ok, now back to nintendo puzzle&#160;;)
 AntiSquid:&#160;:'(
 Zenoscave: jk Anti
 Uljahn: silver in python == gold in c++ :smirk:
 AntiSquid: but seriously i can't tell anymore, was it really that hard of a contest or did i not invest enough time / attention, i don't remember facing such difficulties to promote
 eulerscheZahl: nintendo or delete @geppoz?
 geppoz: :D
 Zenoscave: in 100 attempts or less
 geppoz: I already risked saying "1st in country or delete"
 miszu: AntiSquid I think it was a matter of time
 geppoz: barely did it&#160;;)
 miszu: but the bots were good
 eulerscheZahl: after emil was gone, the country victory became much easier for me
 geppoz: there is 100 times french that any other country so...
 AntiSquid: emil self-deported
 geppoz: 60 it vs 3000 fr
 struct: Not much competition in portugal
 struct: there were only 2 people in gold
 geppoz: 4 italy in gold
 miszu: guess my competition in Canada...
 AntiSquid: lots of new faces overall, wonder how many stay
 geppoz: about nintendo i tried hard years ago
 geppoz: timeouting in final tests
 geppoz: then forgot about it, now it came again in my mind :D
 struct: Just change country
 eulerscheZahl: only 2 Germany in legend
 eulerscheZahl: at least 22 in gold
 miszu: we are the peaceful country. Why would I change it?
 Nerchio: stop submiting in fall challenge guys its over
 Nerchio: you are pushing me down
 Nerchio: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: me too
 Zenoscave: STOP THE COUNT
 BoBot: sry guys, can someone explain something about the beam search - people comment that they have beam width of X, f.e. X=1000 at depth 1...how is it possible to have X larger than the branching factor in this game...which is like &lt;30 even with multiplications
 Zenoscave: you use up to the beam width but not all of it
 eulerscheZahl: at depth 1 you don't reach that width
 eulerscheZahl: but at higher depths around 3-4 you do
 BoBot: ok, so the descriptions are a bit suspect :D then I get it thx
 Nerchio: i looked up RUST as an alternative to C++ for next competition damn the language looks rough
 struct: maybe my beam width was too high
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>a 1 month contest to learn it
 eulerscheZahl: that's how dbdr started. on RAIC
 BoBot: damn, reading the PMs it makes me feel I missed very little from hitting legend...I mean I got mid gold but I feel like I could have gotten farther
 eulerscheZahl: He came from Java as well
 Nerchio: i might try raic out
 BoBot: I did not implement patience in my eval, and right now shoehorning it in does not seem to work
 struct: I would try rust, but I feel like I still have so much to learn on c++
 eulerscheZahl: warning: the next contest might be burnout complex
 BoBot: I also did best-first search, not beam search, I guess that is the reason
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: a starcraft game with base building, resource management, fighting units
 Nerchio: sounds good
 BoBot: wait what? :O
 Astrobytes: in 3d
 Nerchio: not good
 Nerchio: :D
 BoBot: ofcourse it sounds good to you @Nerchio&#160;;)
 Gronahak: 4d&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: might be just UI in 3D and game in 2D
 Astrobytes: hm, it's RAIC

 BoBot: haha I did best in the contest that played like a MOBA game, and I have played thousands of hours of Dota, felt like it helped
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC is always more complex than CG games
 Nerchio: i can't even create an array with the size i read from input in rust :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: more tiny little details to make the engine complicated
 dbdr: Nerchio use Vec
 eulerscheZahl: a starter code that's like 30 files
 AllYourMCTS: i like rust!
 Nerchio: it's not slow?
 struct: What are the machine specs in raic usually?
 dbdr: no
 AntiSquid: do you think they'll introduce some weird kind of aiming again for RAIC?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea struct
 AntiSquid: or maybe ships have velocity and fly by when trying to shoot
 struct: is multi thread allowed there?
 eulerscheZahl: but the games last much longer than on CG
 AllYourMCTS: rust is touted as equal speed of c++
 AllYourMCTS: not sure about actual performance for CG stuff though
 Nerchio: i know thats why i wanna try it out
 eulerscheZahl: CodeBall had 15k ticks where your bot could make an action
 dbdr: Vec is like an array in Java/C#, in that it's behind a reference
 eulerscheZahl: a replay with a 5min viewing duration and 60FPS
 dbdr: rust array is an immediate value, you can't even do that in Java at all
 AntiSquid: they never release source code of game engine do they?
 eulerscheZahl: your bot had 6min in total to play the game. add the opponent and you are at 12min for a single match
 struct: 12 min total?
 struct: Are submits slow?
 AntiSquid: and the starter code was pain

 Astrobytes: do players do PMs for RAIC? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes. in Russian
 eulerscheZahl: but publishing the code after the contest is common there
 reCurse: Easier when there's no multi after
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah indeed
 eulerscheZahl: i think i won't enter RAIC this time to keep my sanity. others might enjoy it
 Nerchio: looks difficult
 reCurse: I have a hard time believing it's enjoyable
 dbf: they promised to publish some promo about raic tomorrow, so maybe we will have a bit more details
 struct: I doubt ill join
 AllYourMCTS: did anyone use spell values based on the available potions for content?
 AllYourMCTS: contest*
 reCurse: They're in the category of contests that think design needs a billion details otherwise it's bad
 reCurse: Then you realize what a horrible mess it is
 eulerscheZahl: when it comes to completing a potion and LEARN is a good path: yes
 dbf: yep, they like to add a lot of details, that are mostly ignored&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: specifically choosing that spell in the first turns: i don't think so
 reCurse: If you like figuring out a broken game sure. AI though...
 eulerscheZahl: like: you can only climb a ladder if the bottom half of your body center line is on it
 eulerscheZahl: (last RAIC)
 eulerscheZahl: and you have a gun. but everytime you change your aim, you add some randomness to where you shoot
 eulerscheZahl: so don't shake too much
 reCurse: The contest is a second thought
 reCurse: Let's have fun with the design instead
 dbf: I hope it will be easier to control units, than in 2017
 eulerscheZahl: if it wasn't for the suicide mine, i might have actually enjoyed the lat RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: 2017 was a pain
 eulerscheZahl: draw a rectangle to select units
 eulerscheZahl: next turn: you have them selected
 eulerscheZahl: now you can move that block of units
 eulerscheZahl: but don't move into the other units as they will get stuck and none is moving anymore
 dbf: but you can't move them every step&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, your code gets called 60x per second
 eulerscheZahl: but you can only file 10 commands
 eulerscheZahl: except if you capture command centers, then you get a few more
 tibithegreat: Question: in the questmap I had a challenge to get gold in a contest, and I managed to get to gold in the fall challenge but the quest map doesn't see it&#160;:(
 BoBot: wait, so you were literally fighting for time/cpu resources in the game?
 tibithegreat: is there anything else I need to do?
 eulerscheZahl: my guess: you never really promoted in the fall challenge multiplayer game
 eulerscheZahl: they just moved the arena
 eulerscheZahl: so that might not trigger the quest completion
 eulerscheZahl: someone reported that on the forum already
 tibithegreat: but in the arena I'm already gold
 dbf: @BoBot no, it was just to make this game closer to how humans plays rts (don't know why they wanted it)
 tibithegreat: so I can't promote to gold there either
 eulerscheZahl: known bug, that's all I can say
 tibithegreat: oh ok
 BoBot: I think this is the first time you did not have to resubmit to the MP yourself? 
 reCurse: Spring was like that too I think
 Astrobytes: "closer to how humans plays rts " - when we're coding bots to play against bots... :D
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC organizers sometimes put the game experience over the bot programming experience
 reCurse: This.
 reCurse: A thousand times
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes you can play the game vs a bot in your browser
 eulerscheZahl: or offline runner
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but that's not the point of the contest
 eulerscheZahl: but then i always struggled with the controls and lost to my bot as i was just to slow to do anything
 eulerscheZahl: as i said: i'll probably pass
 Astrobytes: Not like you have a panel of judges all playing manually against all the bots :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 geppoz: any of you solved Nintendo? it is really possible?
 struct: ofc its possible
 struct: I just dont know how to solve it
 Astrobytes: It's somewhat mathematical apparently :P
 Astrobytes: all I know about it is Galois fields are a small part of it. And I'm weak in field theory. And everything else that pertains to that puzzle :D
 reCurse: Strange puzzle for nintendo tbh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not sure what they were looking for with that...
 AllYourWhat: i mean don't game devs usually need to heavily optimize stuff and use math a lot for trig/pruning/visuals/etc?
 Zenoscave: not that kind of math
 reCurse: There are a lot of different prog fields in game dev
 reCurse: Just not that kind of stuff, normally
 Astrobytes: Maybe they wanted someone to make really, really good license keys 
 reCurse: Or just hire a company actually specialized in the domain shrug
 geppoz: +1 :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm completely clueless at nintendo. the only official puzzle that i have not solved
 Astrobytes: Yeah, would make more sense
 AllYourWhat: why get a company when you can get a dev on cheap who doesn't know how much they're worth!
 reCurse: Because it's actually more expensive
 Astrobytes: didn't someone say there's a video about it? Some dude paid a mathematics professor to explain the maths to him
 player_one: I solved the 32 bit ones, and then wasn't motivated to optimize my solution for bigger numbers.
 reCurse: With the notable few exceptions of some middlewares with shark royalties
 reCurse: But not like you will recode those anyway
 player_one: Now my head's not in that space anymore.
 AllYourWhat: while answer not foudn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94f3ce50-ef72-44a3-b395-3c3780acc5fd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94f3ce50-ef72-44a3-b395-3c3780acc5fd</a>
 reCurse: 4.2% timeout during rerun :o
 eulerscheZahl: and who timed out the most?
 reCurse: That's harder to grep
 reCurse: Need to plug that in c#
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec6884a3-a688-4626-bdd1-bc957fcd52d7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec6884a3-a688-4626-bdd1-bc957fcd52d7</a>
 eulerscheZahl: some parsing for the winrates by bot
 reCurse: eww python
 reCurse: But thanks
 reCurse: Already got the structures mapped out in c# anyway
 eulerscheZahl: did the download in python. somehow i once encountered difficulties with C# on another website. My Linux didn't have the encryption algo needed and Mono said it's the task of the OS
 eulerscheZahl: me: shall i really fiddle with my system to get it working? nope, python
 miszu: my MCTS does 3k simulations but chose the worst path. I guess my backpropagate is not doing it properly
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i stuck with it
 reCurse: Well Mono...
 eulerscheZahl: yes..
 reCurse: At least you have .net core now
 eulerscheZahl: i'm on .net core now
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 reCurse: Or .net 5 now
 eulerscheZahl: was years ago before .net core was a thing
 reCurse: Microsoft, there's a lot of things I like about you, but your marketing is not one of them
 Astrobytes: I swear their whole marketing dept is high
 reCurse: They've been consistently weird for what. 30 years?
 reCurse: It's an achivement
 dbdr: not just the marketing
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: Was waiting for that snark
 eulerscheZahl: they made a lot of good decisions in the near past IMO
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/323/">https://xkcd.com/323/</a>
 reCurse: Not trendy to like Microsoft I know
 eulerscheZahl: .net under MIT, getting closer to Linux, ..
 reCurse: They needed to get Ballmer out
 reCurse: Now it's better
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just not a fan of Windows itself. with there telemetry and all that. and i got used to my linux now
 reCurse: They get a lot of flak for their telemetry and deservedly so
 reCurse: But at the same time
 reCurse: You're getting it much worse from websites
 reCurse: So shrug
 dbdr: it's my machine, why should I run secret code on it?
 eulerscheZahl: true&#160;:(
 reCurse: Do you have intel dbdr?
 dbdr: yes
 reCurse: Ok.
 Zenoscave: well then...
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see why i should pay for something that i can get for free in a more customizable version
 reCurse: Well have I got news for you
 dbdr: i kno the hardware situation is far from ideal
 dbdr: not a reason to add one more layer if I can avoid it
 dbdr: not news to me
 dbdr: I know
 reCurse: Just saying
 reCurse: You don't own anything
 reCurse: Not modern hardware anyway
 eulerscheZahl: but in general my opinion about MS improved in the last few years with their new open source mentality
 dbdr: that does not make software irrelevant
 reCurse: "it's mine, why should it run secret stuff" is a lost cause imo
 reCurse: But I agree just saying
 dbdr: are you saying open source will somehow disappear?
 reCurse: Which browser are you using?
 dbdr: firefox
 reCurse: Their privacy is just marketing
 dbdr: I had phases with chromium too
 reCurse: You're getting f* from so many angles
 dbdr: just marketing for what? Mozilla is a non-profit (owning a corporation for legal reasons, does not change the principle)
 reCurse: They're far from stellar in privacy
 dbdr: nothing's perfect
 dbdr: I can still make choice
 dbdr: s
 reCurse: I was just saying I'm not sure microsoft's make a big difference in the big picture
 reCurse: But of course it's your choice
 dbdr: google might be worse now, yes
 reCurse: The privacy landscape is a dumpster fire that's too late to extinguish imo
 AllYourWhat: lets just pull the plug on the entire internet
 AllYourWhat: and start over
 dbdr: for me benefit of open source is not only privacy
 dbdr: it's also: if the maintainer/owner company makes a stupid decision, can someone fork the project to make take it in another direction?
 reCurse: I was not arguing against open source or am I misreading
 dbdr: I don't know&#160;:) I was saying I prefer to run open source on my machine when I have the choice
 reCurse: Oh ok, sure. That's valid
 reCurse: Wish it was easier to like Microsoft publically sometimes.
 dbdr: it's ok, you did your coming out, we still like you&#160;;)
 dbdr: the way you are&#160;;)
 reCurse: Doesn't mean I hate linux or open source, heck I always have a wsl terminal up and running.
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: always found it odd that Apple never got the same level of hate as MS
 struct: Im hoping that GUI comes soon to wsl
 struct: They have showcased it
 reCurse: Apple has good marketing
 reCurse: Which is the complete opposite
 reCurse: Wasn't it already released?
 reCurse: I mean insiders
 Zenoscave: i don't think so. I haven't seen it
 struct: Havent tried on insiders
 Zenoscave: ah insiders maybe yeah
 struct: "GUI app support in WSL is becoming a reality! We are getting closer to an initial preview and happy to announce a preview release for Windows Insiders within the next couple of months."
 struct: september 22
 reCurse: Oh ok my bad
 reCurse: I really don't care about linux gui tbh
 reCurse: But it's always good
 reCurse: I'd say it's one of the main reasons I stick to windows
 Astrobytes: Yep. Convenience.
 reCurse: Or not horrible gui
 Zenoscave: even the better gui's for distros are a pain
 Zenoscave: Elementary tries but still...
 reCurse: It takes a lot of work to pull off
 reCurse: And not something sexy to work on
 reCurse: So you need to get paid
 Zenoscave: ^ this
 reCurse: It's been a while I did C#
 reCurse: When did they add automated source download and break
 AntiSquid: lol linux gui for windows :D
 reCurse: That's so good
 Astrobytes: Yeah, good UI (and overall UX) needs a healthy dose of good HCI knowledge, something many lack 
 struct: AntiSquid is just to run the apps
 Zenoscave: The c# field is really improving
 reCurse: I wish I still had a use for c#
 reCurse: I mean work or otherwise
 struct: Only app gui will show
 AntiSquid: yes it's good, what's not good is windows people who are afraid to understand/ have a look at WSL and probably even at this new feature ... hard to convince some folks 
 struct: Well with wsl i dont really need dual boot anymore
 reCurse: WSL2 is amazing tbh
 struct: its so fast
 Astrobytes: I need to upgrade my windows version (still on 8.1 for music software/plugins), but I'm willing to break them after all the latest WSL developments
 Zenoscave: 8.1&#160;!?!?!?!?!?
 Zenoscave: Astro...
 ZarthaxX: im on win7 lol
 Astrobytes: It would have broken a lot of plugins and software :shrug:
 Astrobytes: I run it like classic windows though, not all that weird app shit
 Zenoscave: Wait i thought win7 were all pushed to 10. Am I wrong
 reCurse: They offered free upgrade
 reCurse: Not forced
 Zenoscave: Huh some were forced i vaguely remember. 
 reCurse: Hmm
 struct: I recal earing something like forced
 Zenoscave: I heard of  updates auto starting and switching to 10 on a patch day
 Astrobytes: I think the download was forced but not the install or something
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think it depended on your update settings
 ZarthaxX: :thi
 Astrobytes: how much is the upgrade anyway?
 ZarthaxX: i didnt know about that :P
 Zenoscave: it was 80-100 USD when i looked
 Zenoscave: perhaps as changed
 struct: Isnt upgrade free?
 struct: from windows 7 and 8.1
 dbf: I decided to switch to win 10 once I have a new pc, but I don't have any upgrades in last ~7 years, lol
 Astrobytes: it was struct but not now
 player_one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/</a>
 player_one: I haven't tried it, but this information still pops up every once-in-a-while.
 struct: "You can also still upgrade Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro by using a product key from a previous business edition of Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 (Pro/Ultimate)."
 emh: are points for contest delivered yet? what rank do you need to get points?
 emh: I got 0 so far it seems
 reCurse: Points will be done in a few hours I believe
 Astrobytes: player_one: I've seen that but haven't tried it
 reCurse: It's done once per day
 dbf: emh, they are recalced overnight usually
 emh: ahh ok
 struct: I think its added at 1:00 am france time
 emh: btw I released my first game on Steam today <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462200/Speyarranoth/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462200/Speyarranoth/</a>
 emh: it's in Early Access Program
 emh: just an alpha so far
 player_one: Is it good?&#160;;-)
 emh: nahh not yet
 emh: but might become&#160;:)
 emh: hehe
 Astrobytes: It's not based on that NSFW CSB thingy is it? :D
 dbf: is there any AI for asteroids?
 emh: Atrobytes hehehe noooo
 emh: dbf nope
 Astrobytes: good! :D
 Astrobytes: emh, can you make that a CG game or something please :P
 reCurse: grats emh
 miszu: question for MCTS, does a node represent who is the next player to play or is it the previous player who played?
 tibithegreat: I've worked in gamedev for almost 7 years and I have the utmost respect for anyone who manages to actually launch a game. So congrats emh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm still running 8.1 pro, 10 was crashing all my apps and hogging resources.  The superfetch was killing it's usability.  I had to turn off all the updates,cloud,play store crap ... but 8.1 is stable as hell.  So I can't play some win10 directx12 dependent first person shooters... i have other machines for that.  Chrome &amp; silverlight are my nemesis, they open too many security holes and I refuse to use them.  ok, TMI.
 AntiSquid: looks like a nice pew pew game emh
 AntiSquid: see? that's why CSB needs lazors and asteroids flying towards the pods!
 tibithegreat: doesn't matter how big or complex the game is, if you went through the launching pains, you've been through stuff
 Astrobytes: hm? You need to keep track of whose turn it is miszu, then score the nodes accordingly
 miszu: Astrobytes my mcts returns the worst possible move
 Astrobytes: reversed scoring?
 AllYourWhat: the score in the current node is from applying the action from the parent node
 reCurse: Ok so player with most timeouts in rerun is :drum:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: emh did you write a postmortem?
 reCurse: Deleted account with 1081 timeouts
 emh: Astrobytes hehe it's made with Unity. porting to PIXI would be a challenge
 emh: tibithegreat thanks&#160;:)
 emh: AntiSquid thanks&#160;:)
 reCurse: 2nd place goes to SaiksyApo with 65 timeouts
 emh: PatrickMcGinnisII nope
 Astrobytes: Yeah, simplified I mean emh&#160;;)and yeah, well done! 
 miszu: my node has a player variable. That variable is who's turn it is
 emh: thanks Astrobytes hehe
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e0e864c-f364-4c88-bc7f-b074a498f731">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e0e864c-f364-4c88-bc7f-b074a498f731</a>

 AllYourWhat: change the first condition to ```result&#160;!= node-&gt;player```
 miszu: why though?
 Zenoscave: you're counting wins for opponent not you
 AllYourWhat: you're root node is your action, to get the best action you're looking at its children's scores
 AllYourWhat: but the children of the root will be your opponents action
 AllYourWhat: that continues down the tree, just easiest to think about from the root and children fo root
 miszu: yeah I get that
 miszu: but the child wants to win as much as possible so it should increase its score if it wins no?
 AllYourWhat: yeah but an actions score is contained in the child node that it leads to
 struct: emh you dont have to use PIXi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu you do realize you can do all that back peddling in one while loop without recursion right?   like while(node!=NULL) {node-&gt;visit++; node-&gt;wincount+=(result==.5?:.5:1);node=node-&gt;paremt;}  thaqt kinda thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: man my typing is bad
 miszu: PatrickMcGinnisII yeah I realized that&#160;:/ was following a website for the skeleton of MCTS. I can see you could optimize it
 miszu: does doing stack calling is slower than loop?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: everytime you push and pop and branch or instantiate objects you are wasting time
 emh: struct can I use Unity WebGL? wonder how CG integration would work though and still, my game uses the HDRP pipeline so would need to convert it to the WebGL pipeline (LWRP/URP or what it's called)
 miszu: PatrickMcGinnisII branch you mean like if else if statement?
 struct: I dont know emh, I never tried or looked into it, I just know that euler maged to use three js with viewer <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/849340c736362b181cdae18a8345462538aa01">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/849340c736362b181cdae18a8345462538aa01</a>
 struct: press play my code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: calling any function you push vars and change the instruction pointer, etc... if/else is fine if its organized properly
 miszu: I'll benchmark it to see how big of a difference does it make
 miszu: ok it clicked now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I often write code that's not efficient, but after it's working properly ... it needs to be efficient.  Recursion is your enemy, unless you have a super efficient use for it.
 miszu: your children is your score basically
 AllYourWhat:&#160;:)

 PatrickMcGinnisII: thanks reCurse, anyone over 1% should be penalized ... that's sloppy
 reCurse:&#160;?
 reCurse: There were server issues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was seeing plenty of bots ranked 400 places above me, timing out ... it wasn't the server, instead of scaling back and refiguring what they were doing they would rather take the 1%+ loss ... it's just sloppy
 Astrobytes: No, there really were server issues.
 struct: Even CG aknowledged the timeouts
 Astrobytes: never clicking on your homepage again emh :P
 kovi: imho speed was not that important so i have chosen the safe 36ms
 kovi: (not that important for c++/beam)
 miszu: ok I am beating the silver boss bot easilly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have run speed tests ... and the execution times for multiple runs on same code can vary alot.  
 miszu: with 3k sims at turn 2
 struct: nice you should place around top 150 in gold
 Astrobytes: cool miszu!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I would think there would be less variance on a compiled code than a scripting lang
 miszu: let me see if I can win if the bot starts... just to not humiliate myself
 Astrobytes: oh, not a submit, just IDE?
 miszu: yeah
 Astrobytes: watch out for that&#160;;)
 miszu: and I won vs bot when I am the O
 miszu: the bot won when I am the O just now...
 miszu: NIUUUUU
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe I'm wrong, i guess sending and recieving responses can get tied up in que
 miszu: I think I missed a condition check if I start 2nd
 reCurse: There were random hiccups were your code would be interrupted for up to 30ms
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu this uttt?
 reCurse: *where
 reCurse: Even in C++
 miszu: yeah
 miszu: super wierd. When I am X I beat the boss like for breakfast. If I am O, my bot is doing horrible
 emh: Astrobytes hehe. nsfw stuff is hidden. you need direct link to go there. on front is safe for children
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, there must be some kinda timestamping ... but i guess hyperthreading cores... sh*t what do i know
 Astrobytes: lol, I'm no child but I can't unsee that emh. CSB has never looked the same since :D
 Astrobytes: miszu: bug in your sim?
 miszu: my mcts looks fine
 miszu: but why when you flip role you don't do well
 Astrobytes: that's why I said check your sim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reading the post mortem on the challenge and seeing how euler and domiko bitpacked the inventory and applied the transformations is pretty kewl
 AntiSquid: kovi what is tc-ish&#160;?", so it is too much a solo optimization game with relatively narrow possible approaches (more tc-ish than cg-ish)"
 reCurse: topcoder
 AntiSquid: ah
 Astrobytes: I get his point completely.
 AntiSquid: i thought i'd be amongst the very few that didn't really liked it that much . 
 AntiSquid: thought more people would enjoy the heavy opti focus
 Astrobytes: I wasn't keen from the start. But I grew some motivation on Saturday and Sunday :P
 AntiSquid: i was enjoying this more <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://spicee.mattle.online/lobby">https://spicee.mattle.online/lobby</a> :P
 AntiSquid: actually we can play that as guests if anyone is interested
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: No thanks
 AntiSquid: not best graphics, but it's ok game
 Astrobytes: I only came across the mattle site recently
 reCurse: This game is horrible
 PatrickMcGinnisII: love the dragons emh
 AntiSquid: are you going to write a PM reCurse&#160;? about your approach 
 reCurse: Maybe, unlikely
 kovi: too bad this game has no use for battlestation
 struct: Next contest physics please
 reCurse: I could have used it to analyze search
 struct: I want fb like
 reCurse: Until I realized there is no point in having good search
 AntiSquid: physics with fog or we delete in protest, right struct&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Give it a day or so reCurse. There's a lot of interest&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: (re. PM)
 reCurse: A lot of the stuff has been spoiled with other PMs and top 2 deserve it more since I'm so far from them.
 Astrobytes: Meh. Like I said, give it a day or 2
 kovi: well, i like anything which is not beamsearch
 Astrobytes: ^
 reCurse: And chokudai?
 miszu: so muy UTTT bot chose path that has high chance to win and output&#160;% of win and then suddently it drops by 10% even &lt; 50%
 miszu: I don't cache my mcts. I do a completely new mcts each time
 kovi: ok, some totally different approach (eg. include enemy prediction or something)
 kovi: and effective(dp and full-grapf resolve was interesting, but not useful enough)
 reCurse: Well I have a mostly useless endgame search I guess
 reCurse: Spent too much time on endgame before realizing it's also pointless
 Astrobytes: This is why you should write a PM (no pressure)
 Rounddice: I'm confused, why am I rank 5 again!? I was 19th when the Legend recount happened.
 reCurse: That's the purpose of a recount
 Rounddice: No, but I was 19th at the END of the recount.
 reCurse: Oh you meant the multi sorry
 reCurse: They duplicated the arena for rerun
 kovi: was endgame pointless?i only had simple heuristics toward that one
 reCurse: What you have is before rerun I think
 reCurse: Ok let me rephrase
 reCurse: It's pointless to go further than 'good enough'
 reCurse: Just like it's pointless with search to go further than 'good enough'
 reCurse: It's a strange game, the recipe draw breaks everything
 reCurse: Which is why I found amusing so much talk about perf when it didn't matter
 Cosmeen: Is clash of code actually helping me improve my coding, or am I just procrastinating? xd
 reCurse: It looks like more optim should be great but actually
 Astrobytes: The latter Cosmeen
 ClockSort: where can i see final standings? is this this, or is this the multi? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020/leaderboard?column=LANGUAGE&amp;value=ALL">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020/leaderboard?column=LANGUAGE&amp;value=ALL</a>

 reCurse: On every compute intensive CG game I always get something out of more perf or more efficient
 reCurse: This game? Had to stop my bot from searching more because it played worse for it
 kovi: true
 -Rutger-: @reCurse did you output the gamestate in challenge aswell? to debug locally&#160;?
 reCurse: I used... :drum:
 reCurse: Bitstreams
 Zenoscave: Lol duh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I didn't know taking the first 8 0 cost learns was actually a thing at op of leaderboard
 Astrobytes: damn you were faster than my inb4
 -Rutger-: ah like you explained in your video&#160;?
 reCurse: Yes
 reCurse: Except don't do this at home
 reCurse: There are much better ways
 Astrobytes: (it's subjective)
 reCurse: And with a small game state like this one I just base64 the whole state pointer
 AntiSquid: his 3rd video holds the secret to sentient AI, ask him about it -Rutger-
 Zenoscave: Serialization is an interesting subject
 -Rutger-:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: What depth performed best for your bot reCurse? mine seems to be 8-12
 reCurse: 15
 Zenoscave: I tried that but perhaps beam width played a part too
 reCurse: Found with much cursing and submitting
 Zenoscave: too large a beam width gave bad results also
 Astrobytes: (re)cursing and re(submitting)
 -Rutger-: @AntiSquid im still hoping for more video's&#160;;)
 Rounddice: I made it dependent on the state of the game. Not sure whether that was a good idea
 Zenoscave: don't hold your breath
 reCurse: It was a fun experiment but I'm done with those
 -Rutger-: haha i would be dead by now :p
 reCurse: Even part 2 is debatable
 Astrobytes: the beam width Rounddice?
 Astrobytes: or the depth?
 Rounddice: Both
 Astrobytes: Oh
 Rounddice: I decreased depth and increased with towards end
 struct: re curse why did you decided to not do it anymore? Do you think the locam videos did not have enough quality?
 reCurse: Part 2 was a downgrade
 Astrobytes: interesting
 reCurse: I'm not a showman
 reCurse: I understand the effort required to make good content
 reCurse: I'm not interested in putting it
 Astrobytes: No, but it was very informative
 Astrobytes: And you don't have to do much to impress an audience of programmers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Where is this Ai takes over the world video?
 reCurse: Thanks but meh
 struct: I understand
 reCurse: There's much better out there
 struct: I enjoyed them though
 -Rutger-: yeah me too. i liked the fact that it wasn't prepared
 Astrobytes: I dislike programming streams for the most part. I watch some youtube stuff now and then
 NitMpez: i'd hate someone to watch my programming stream... it'd be awful for them and me
 struct: It can be fustrating I guess
 reCurse: There's a lot of pressure to be entertaining. It's a weird feeling.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I watch a couple PY streams during contest... it was actually kinda funny watching them pull their hair out
 reCurse: Made me understand a lot more how some streamers work.
 Astrobytes: I prefer content over entertainment in "knowledge-based" media
 AntiSquid: i am amazed by instafluff guy gathering such a huge audience
 NitMpez: i get coders block too much, i feel like i would be streaming me staring at code trying to figure out what to do next
 Astrobytes: look at erricht o ... not exactly riveting
 Astrobytes: But gets the job done
 AntiSquid: ya but he's been doing it for a long time
 struct: I opened his stream when he was trying to do DP for Fall challenge
 Astrobytes: in between being harassed by randos wanting to know how to be the best at CP in a week
 struct: it was too much complicated for me
 AntiSquid: he paces it well imo
 struct: Yeah, but im not really familiar with DP
 AntiSquid: and i like his replies to the randos :D
 Astrobytes: I just don't like the whole CP community thing for the most part
 Astrobytes: Yeah I agree there AntiSquid
 reCurse: Youtube for programming definitely works. I don't understand its appeal for streaming though.
 Astrobytes: For a bit of fun it's alright, in the context of CG I think it works depending who is doing it
 NitMpez: I just don't want to deal with the negative criticism on what I stream
 Astrobytes: Don't stream. Upload video. Delete trolls.
 AntiSquid: DrDisrespect moved to youtube because of twitch ban, still tons of views. I just maximize view and don't care about chat most of the time.
 reCurse: I say youtube as in video
 AntiSquid: yes
 reCurse: Youtube streaming is still streaming
 miszu: alright submitting my bot in UTT. Wish me luck
 Astrobytes: yeah totally
 Majeck: Astrobytes what do you mean by the CP community?
 NitMpez: gl
 struct: videos is way easier to make it look better
 reCurse: Competitive Programming
 Astrobytes: oh Competitive Programming
 Majeck: Oh
 Cosmeen: Is there anything more productive I can do on this website? I finished all my hw for college, and have some free time, but I don't want to go back to playing Minecraft&#160;:)) 
 Majeck: what a horrible acronym lol
 Astrobytes: oh not that again
 Majeck: Cosmeen Bot programming
 AntiSquid: uninstall minecraft Cosmeen
 Majeck: Or code golf
 Astrobytes: ^
 Majeck: Both are fun and easy to get into
 struct: Check fall challenge 2020
 Astrobytes: (not code golf, bot programming)
 Cosmeen: I saw they added a quest map, what path is most interesting? 
 struct: AI
 reCurse: Clash of course
 Astrobytes: all of them except the ones you don't like
 AntiSquid: the ML one
 Astrobytes: It's not like you *have* to complete it
 miszu: 1st in silver
 Cosmeen: AntiSquid just for the memories man, really felt good since I didn't play in like 2 years 
 Cosmeen: AI is that one? 
 Astrobytes: problem with switching player id's miszu?
 miszu: Astrobytes I don't think so. I doubled check and it looks fine
 AntiSquid: actually you could try to do some Minecraft ML if you are willing to put up with debugging and setup headaches ... 
 miszu: sometimes it goes for promising move but actually it made it worse and the&#160;% went down
 miszu: I do 3k sims
 Cosmeen: I didn't get into ML yet actually, would be nice to go ahead on what they teach at college, where should I start with that? 
 Astrobytes: cool, so it's working to some extent at least
 miszu: maybe my numbers are not high enough
 miszu: 3k might not be enough to see if a move would be a bad move but my mcts sees it as most promissing
 miszu: at least my rating is above the boss
 NitMpez: feel like first contest i did in a while... i actually di code vs zombies again in c++ and acraft to prepare doing this contest in c++
 miszu: I have 29.69 and boss has 28.14
 Astrobytes: looks like you're going up if you keep that score going
 miszu: oh for sure I am going to gold
 Astrobytes: Cosmeen: what have you learned in college?
 miszu: but will it cut to legendary? :P
 Astrobytes: That's when you need the optimisations.
 Astrobytes: 20K+ iirc for legend?
 Astrobytes: I don't have a proper UTTT bot yet. I've been putting it off.
 reCurse: Don't
 NitMpez: haven't even tried yet
 struct: Only was worth it because I didnt spent much time on it
 NitMpez: been trying to go back and do contests i missed
 Astrobytes: It's one of those rainy day ones where something else is always preferable for me
 miszu: look at this and the debug values
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/510145494">https://www.codingame.com/replay/510145494</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my backyard is 2 foot tall grass now because of the contest
 miszu: I am around 50%, one time 60%ish and then 40% and then lost
 Astrobytes: guessing your debug values are going to stderr
 miszu: yeah
 AntiSquid: PatrickMcGinnisII just put fake grass on top
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu i played your bot before it promoted, good job...better than me, butt hat's not hard
 Astrobytes: (so we can't see that... :D )
 NitMpez: :P
 miszu: PatrickMcGinnisII when did you play vs my bot?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my hottub has a frog living in it now, wth
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn it CG
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just now miszu
 Astrobytes: get in there and 'befriend' it
 miszu: I can't see your bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hes' actually pretty cool, just hope he doesn't die when i put chems in it
 miszu: like I don't see your profile pic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh I'm way down in silver in uttt, i didn't put in alot of effort
 Astrobytes: take the poor wee thing out before you put anything in it Patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I usually only get in it in the winter, too freakin hot in summer
 Astrobytes: You don't have a thermostat?
 AntiSquid: is that how you see your tenant? as a frog&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Not that I own a hot tub I may add. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they are tree frogs,  they geet around... sticky feet
 Astrobytes: well put it back on a tree before dosing it with muriatic acid or chlorine
 miszu: promotion to gold in 30 min!&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I actually have another house, I'm kicking that tenant out in february
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'd rather have the frogs
 Astrobytes: nice one miszu&#160;:)
 miszu: 3.6 points difference than the bot
 miszu: let's see gold later :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no acid, I'll prolly drain it first so I don't have to use as many cchems
 miszu: my next improvement is to actually keep the mcts used and continue for next iterations
 AntiSquid: kicking out? oof what happened
 miszu: it does fresh mcts each turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't do beam in contest,  I'm probably going to have to now
 Astrobytes: just set your root to the best node and go from there. But you're gonna need some more optimisations
 miszu: yeah but I use dynamic allocations&#160;:/
 miszu: so I need to modify that
 Astrobytes: turn 1, preallocate or die screaming
 AntiSquid: i reach all states, but only for creating one potion :D
 miszu: yeah I need a datastructure for my pool of nodes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tenant always tearing up my stuff, they broke the kitchen faucet, the tub spout, the front door, holes in the walls... they suck!  house was perfect when they moved in.  They put an above ground pool up in backyard w/o telling me...now it's full of fungi and mosquito larvae.  And they killed all the grass, i could go on and on.
 AntiSquid: wow assholes .
 miszu: PatrickMcGinnisII do you have damage deposit?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I gotta work on stuff b4 dark...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: more dmg. than that'll pay for
 AntiSquid: sounds like my former next door neighbours
 AntiSquid: digging holes in the backyard :D
 miszu: can't you sue them?
 AntiSquid: guy walking around in towel ... not sure if with or w/o underwear
 Astrobytes: Node* nodes; Node nodes[NODE_MAX]; have a play an d see what works miszu
 miszu: Astrobytes how can you guarantee that the next one you use is not used in your mcts?
 struct: everytime you store in a node
 struct: you increment
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i told tenant already to prep for move, they tried to change the numbers on the lease for the deposit...I'm like, yall ain't getting any $ back ... go ahead and sue me with your fraudulent documents... dumb asses.
 Astrobytes: ^ and make a s**tload of them
 miszu: is it possible your whole array is used?
 struct: well yes
 miszu: # of sims = # of nodes you need right?
 Astrobytes: I'll let struct answer that one&#160;;)
 struct: I think thats seems right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll trade rental house for condo in scotland, rofl
 struct: On uttt I allocate like 18Mill
 struct: But that is because my MCTS is not right
 miszu: cuz in traverse() you keep digging if your node is full of visited children, then you create new node
 miszu: 18 mils?
 miszu: CG can handle that shit?
 Astrobytes: you must be mad PatrickMcGinnisII
 struct: depends on the size of node
 struct: you have 768MB
 Astrobytes: ^
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f149a50d-366e-4bb9-b4df-4ded4ef9c6cf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f149a50d-366e-4bb9-b4df-4ded4ef9c6cf</a>
 miszu: plz don't roast me&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: this is where the optimisation part begins
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is crazy ... in a good way.</b></p><p><img src="/a/12323424608735" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, work to do, glhf.
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/86dea8db-31cf-4b8e-a0b6-65c7daffa77b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/86dea8db-31cf-4b8e-a0b6-65c7daffa77b</a>
 Astrobytes: later PatrickMcGinnisII
 struct: and I can even reduce the size
 struct: if  I change the first 3 vars to int8_t
 miszu: yeah but 1st child index can be misleading, what if the next index is used for another node?
 Astrobytes: I was gonna say 
 struct: i know how many childs the node have
 miszu: fair enough
 miszu: but you need to select a child at random
 miszu: unvisited
 struct: There are multiple ways to do this
 Astrobytes: Yes but you use the next available node in the preallocated array
 miszu: also, do you use cin for read input?
 miszu: btw, I haven't even include the pragmas
 miszu: so that 3k could be a full 4k
 Astrobytes: add those
 Astrobytes: possibly more
 struct: pragmas on Fall challenge was 10x boost for me
 struct: for some reason
 Astrobytes: bit twiddling weirdo things struct :P
 miszu: I am proud of my bitboarding
 Astrobytes: Voodoo
 miszu: 1st time bitboarding
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/207f54db-0900-4005-a283-b7efe593ef56">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/207f54db-0900-4005-a283-b7efe593ef56</a>
 struct: What was the questin about cin though?
 miszu: is cin okay to use?
 miszu: or better scanf?
 miszu: reading inputs is slow
 damoah2: hello
 struct: I use cin
 miszu: ok no optimization for readings?
 struct: never cared about the performance of reading inputs
 struct: idk, never checked
 darkhorse64: miszu: use tables instead
 miszu: darkhorse64 tables instead of what?
 Astrobytes: your win checking I believe
 miszu: so instead of 11 ors I should have an array where it's precomputed if it is a win or not?
 Majeck: What happened to "emil" in the leaderboard
 Majeck: I can't find the user
 darkhorse64: use a lookup table to compute vitory, loss
 miszu: does it make big difference?
 miszu: in performance?
 Astrobytes: well, you've got almost a second in the first turn, do the maths&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Majeck: #3
 struct: gn everyone
 Majeck: #3 in the contest leaderboard shows up as reCurse
 Astrobytes: gn struct, well done on gold again&#160;:)
 Majeck: was reCurse emil :O
 struct: thanks
 miszu: Astrobytes no I meant instead of using the ors, would using lookup table be much faster?
 miszu:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: should be
 miszu: alright gold runs now!
 struct: Majeck you must play Nier to understand who was emil.
 Majeck: Nier Automata
 AntiSquid: i never played nier automata but the avatar made me think of ...
 Astrobytes: &lt;incoming random anime picture/video&gt;
 Majeck: I thought it represented the lady fish in the Shark Movie
 Majeck: *Shark Tale
 Astrobytes: lol wtaf
 Majeck: Looked like a fish to me hahaha
 Astrobytes: :D
 miszu: top 50% in gold
 AntiSquid: eh Astrobytes&#160;? it made me think of recurz avatar
 Astrobytes: nice, should end up top 1/3 or thereabouts miszu
 miszu: good news is that it shouldn't take much optimisations
 Astrobytes: ah OK AntiSquid, was expecting the usual ;P
 miszu: bad new is... I am about to enter in a world where it's very easy to make a mistake
 Astrobytes: Gold boss is tough from what I know
 miszu: I can draw sometimes with gold boss
 miszu: but didn't win yet
 Astrobytes: good start regardless
 Astrobytes: hey darkhorse64, how did you like the contest?
 miszu: I need to read about pragmas and which one to turn on
 AntiSquid: already gold&#160;?
 Astrobytes: start with #pragma GCC optimize("O3","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline"), try some combinations out. 
 Astrobytes: Depending what you're doing you may need to enable certain vectorization flags
 Astrobytes: etc
 miszu: gonna read about optimize
 miszu: time to activate cheat codes :D
 darkhorse64: Not a first sight. It took me quite some time to figure out what to do. I finally wrote an optimized BFS on Saturday (the previous was slow and buggy) but I failed to design a proper eval
 Astrobytes: Similar to me, though I wasn't keen on the game at all from the start. Didn't get motivated until Saturday, by Sunday I didn't finish my rewrite in time so stayed in silver
 darkhorse64: The key points were compressing the state (600 -&gt; 48 bytes) and removing duplicates (for more depth)
 darkhorse64: Probably, I can get a lot smaller but 500K + visited nodes per turn is enough
 Astrobytes: think it might be more eval-centric rather than raw node counts from what I've heard so far
 miszu: MadKnight here:
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5d2a8c1-4da2-4041-89a2-5bef180c4167">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5d2a8c1-4da2-4041-89a2-5bef180c4167</a>
 darkhorse64: May be I should try the inventory bits trick just to see how much it gains. Having a break rn. The weekend coding session 2x12h has been tiring
 Astrobytes: strange game anyway, don't like it too much. I prefer the user contributions these days
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it takes the energy out of you for sure
 ScriptKiddie0101: genshin impact
 darkhorse64: The penguins  &amp; blocking multis are interesting to try out 3/4 players algos
 Astrobytes: Yeah, next stop for me
 Astrobytes: Also trictrac's fireworks one
 Astrobytes: in contributions
 darkhorse64: miszu: computing moves on a mini board is also a lookup
 darkhorse64: filling a vector :scream:
 miszu: yeah... correctness first, then optimizations :P
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: he just started with it&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: I spent months on optimizing UTTT
 miszu: pragmas, pool of nodes, getting rid of vectors
 Astrobytes: still haven't bothered
 Astrobytes: haven't even check my Oware in a while, need to get back in top 10
 Astrobytes: *checked
 miszu: UTT is a cool project to master basic knowledge of c++
 miszu: 159th/611 in gold
 miszu: if I reach legendary I change my profile pic
 Astrobytes: submit finished?
 miszu: golds run is done
 darkhorse64: This as my first multi and I foolishly imagine that I could be #1. So I try hard. Now I am more modest ...
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 darkhorse64: *was*
 Astrobytes: it's those ankles again darkhorse
 Astrobytes: miszu: top 1/3, struct was correct
 miszu: yeah looks like it
 darkhorse64: Dying PC. Waiting for Black Friday
 miszu: almost top 1/4 :D
 Astrobytes: Indeed miszu
 darkhorse64: How many rollouts second turn&#160;?
 Astrobytes: &lt; 3000
 miszu: 3k on average
 darkhorse64: You need a 6/7 x improvement for Legend
 miszu: darkhorse64 here is an example and look at cerr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510171088">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510171088</a>
 miszu: 3.5k sometimes
 miszu: gonna start with pragmas
 miszu: easiest to fine tune
 miszu: then basic lookup table for smallboard
 miszu: then&#160;???
 Astrobytes: miszu: we can't see your cerr output, only you (that might be weird in a contest if we could right?)
 miszu: oh...
 Astrobytes: You can output stats or whatever after your turn output before the endl/\n
 darkhorse64: move generation. Pragma for Legend might be enough
 miszu: Astrobytes let me try that
 Astrobytes: rerun your submit with the pragma I gave you
 miszu: I want to benchmark the optimize() and the target() as well
 Astrobytes: are you using any special instructions?
 miszu: what special is special?
 Astrobytes: popcnt, ctz etc
 miszu: nope
 miszu: simple c++
 Astrobytes: right, well try with just the pragma I gave you
 darkhorse64: +1
 miszu: I'll try it
 miszu: ok here it is
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510173253">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510173253</a>
 miszu: with the # of sims in cout
 Astrobytes: sorry, was petting my cat :DWhat happened to output on first 2 turns? And is that with or w/out pragma?
 MadKnight: Astrocats
 miszu: haha
 miszu: 1st turn I always play middle
 miszu: 2nd turn is the opponent
 miszu: 3rd turn is me starting mcts
 Astrobytes: Catstrobytes&#160;;)
 miszu: before pragmas
 Astrobytes: oh, yeah, lol, sorry
 Astrobytes: long day
 Astrobytes: now pragma
 miszu: benchmarking the Os
 miszu: ok so Ofast gives me most sims
 miszu: &gt;= 6k
 Astrobytes: I usually start with Ofast and work my way down
 miszu: I did all of them
 miszu: ofast is most consistent
 Astrobytes: try it out and see
 miszu: yeah I just did it
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510176264">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510176264</a>
 miszu: brb
 Astrobytes: argh
 Astrobytes: 3326
 Astrobytes: woops, wrong window
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: away with your EcksDees :P
 Astrobytes: How did you like the contest Scarfield?
 Scarfield: haha, it gave me a needed laugh, judt looked at my contest code and realised why it did so bad
 Astrobytes: I had a similar revelation last night lol
 Scarfield: i liked it well enough, but didnt put enough time in to do much, and also apparently coded something different than what i wanted&#160;:'(
 Scarfield: in an effort to simplify my initial approach, i took 1 ingredient at a time, somehow forgot to change it so it would look for the entire recipe.. saw it within 10 minutes today lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I didn't get motivated until the weekend really, not a big fan of the game, but it was alright
 Astrobytes: hahaha, I had something similar going on Saturday I think
 miszu: funroll-loops doesn't help relaly
 Astrobytes: have you submitted miszu?
 miszu: I just put Ofast for now
 miszu: what's the pragmas you use again?
 Scarfield: i was doing UTTT when i learned about using pragmas, got almost double the simcount from these:
 miszu: nvm foudn it
 Astrobytes: uhhh from memory pragma GCC optimize("03", "inline", "unroll-loops", "omit-frame-pointer ")
 phord: I started out with beam search (didn't know what it was called, though) and couldn't get out of bronze.  Sounds like most of the winners used beam, though.  
 Astrobytes: Scarfield's one should be used with avx/avx2 I believe for auto-vectorization
 phord: I guess my beam was too narrow.&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: *target of avx/avx2
 Scarfield: ah, just copied them from someone in chat, never really looked into what it does :p
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I am totally exhausted. I shall see you all tomorrow, good luck miszu!
 miszu: thanks Astrobytes!
 Scarfield: gn :wave:
 miszu: 102th/611 now

 miszu: simple lookup table for my UTT increases # of sims from 9k to 13k
 ClockSort: UTT =&#160;?
 miszu: Ultimate tic tac toe
 miszu: question about MCTS, is saving the sims and applying your move and opponent move doesn't affect the correctness of the MCTS algorithm? Like I want to know if you can save your mcts for future sims and not restart from 0.
 Lysk: yes you have to select your new root node based on the move you made + move opponent made
 miszu: ok thanks
 crystal_prince: hello

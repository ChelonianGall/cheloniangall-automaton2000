 Thorcode: thanks
 Aaronnotsharon: how early can you start drifting? is there a new input for it? i just started tonight so I'm still in the early stages.
 ZXC01: wha league are you in?
 Aaronnotsharon: wood 3... or wood 1. whichever is just below the next league.
 ZXC01: o
 ZXC01: you are quite early to use drift
 Wontonimo: wait until you are in silver or gold to drift

 zeffo: i suck at clash of code
 zeffo: i dont even understand it
 zeffo: what do i do
 Thorcode: I don't know
 Frinkifail: ok
 Frinkifail: what
 Frinkifail: in the world is happening
 Thorcode: nothing
 Frinkifail: ok
 Frinkifail: simple enough

 [CG]Thibaud: don't do that pleaseTechWithTim.py . Both the question and the link
 TechWithTim.py: ok
 NoahW: There's two kinds of people in the world, those who think their data might be compromised, and those who know their data is compromised.
 NoahW: Oh wow, this clash question is wrong
 TechWithTim.py: ikr
 TechWithTim.py: i confronted one as well
 NoahW: "n qubits can store as much information as 2^n bits."
 NoahW: This is only conditionally true, a single qubit can store an amount of data approaching infinity
 derjack: opening book in 1 qubit? :drooling_face:
 NoahW: I guess it wouldn't be infinite, it would actually be (practically) limited by the planck length
 derjack: but can it run crysis
 derjack: Automaton2000 how maby qubits do you have
 Automaton2000: but i won't be able to predict the opponent
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: 640 qubits ought to be enough for anyone.
 Automaton2000: or maybe the bots code is leaking
 Ryuuk: Hi all
 Ryuuk: can anyone explain to me please the second test case of dungeon-3d problem
 FDASIFJAS: hi,i'm hungry,
 5DN1L: Ryuuk what explanation do you need?
 Ryuuk: i didn't understand how the layers are exactly connected&#160;? each layer is only connected with the next layer with ladders, or it's connected to all other layers&#160;? 
 Ryuuk: for the second test case, if Anya move R -&gt; R -&gt; U (next layer), so she will be blocked
 5DN1L: All layers are connected to the upper or lower floor if both cells are accessible
 Ryuuk: I think i miss understood the problem statement, can you please send me just the movements of Anya to reach S for the second example, so I can understand more the logic behind 
 5DN1L: in terms of (floor, row, column):
 5DN1L: [(3, 0, 0), (2, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2), (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3), (1, 1, 3), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3)]

 niggoa: why bn
 niggoa: ban
 niggoa: he kind
 Uljahn: not the right place for such talks

 niggoa: yes sorry

 Thorcode: geez legend pb4 has not finished the mars lander ep 1
 Uljahn: ep1 is for noobs
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: you also solved that too
 Uljahn: yeah, 6 years ago
 niggoa: i do ep1 and im not noob stop insulting me
 Thorcode: could you help me with mars 2
 Thorcode: I solved that for 2 months hehe
 Thorcode: oh it is 2 not 1
 5DN1L: everyone starts as a noob. it's nothing insulting
 Uljahn: i mean some pro coders don't solve puzzles, they visit CG to compete in AI bot contests
 Thorcode: yep like pb4
 Thorcode: I got start and end in mars and I want to make my rocket land in the right land not in the middle
 Thorcode: lx = (x[d] + x[d+1]) / 2
 VN.NguyenMinhHau: hello
 Thorcode: I got a bit problem wwith my code on marrs lander ep 2 the second test case, wwhy do my rocket run out off the land

 Thorcode: how can I make my rocket fly lower
 Uljahn: decrease power
 Thorcode: I got a simple iff else like thiss
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca526ab1-f2fe-4d26-ba58-b29e64148705">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca526ab1-f2fe-4d26-ba58-b29e64148705</a>
 Thorcode: howw can I improve that to fly lower
 Thorcode: target = lx - 25 * h_speed wwhile lx iss my land
 Uljahn: to fly lower you should maintain negative vertical velocity
 Thorcode: thanks
 Uljahn: vertical velocity depends on the difference of vertical component of power and gravity, vertical power is power*cos(angle), if it's larger than G then vertical velocity increases and vice versa
 Thorcode: I got a basic logic for that puzzle and I'm trying to understand it
 Thorcode: thanks for you help Uljahn

 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: what?

 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: like problems related
 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: search only for problems related to minesweeper something like this
 5DN1L: There's a search box in the top bar
 5DN1L: Would that be useful?
 5DN1L: Or if you accept a more generalised definition of "similar", you may also make use of the tags, which appear in some of the problems, and clicking that will give you more problems to learn a specific area
 5DN1L: For example, "Backtracking" for the sudoku solver: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sudoku-solver">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sudoku-solver</a>

 eulerscheZahl: hi :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: also: troll vs castle at exactly 5000 views
 eulerscheZahl: and exactly 250 comments
 BaD_CoDeR100: I suck
 Astrobytes: lol, same eulerscheZahl
 darkhorse64: #fr is even worse
 Mickael_1321: #de
 eulerscheZahl: did he just tell the mods where he is about to spam and needs to be moderated?
 struct: I think he wanted to join that chat room
 struct: and doesnt know the command
 darkhorse64: axed is the right term
 eulerscheZahl: looking at his message i seriously consider banning him
 darkhorse64: please do
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 eulerscheZahl: come on, he already left the chat&#160;:/
 jacek: you cant ban if he isnt in chat?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 eulerscheZahl: another stunt i could think of: write a script that changes your nickname every few seconds. then i wouldn't know whom to ban
 struct: you can also write a bot to ban them before they can change the name though
 Uljahn: guess you can see nickname change logs in external client
 eulerscheZahl: so far i haven't figured out bow the chat works. only the CG API
 eulerscheZahl: external client might give you an edge, true
 struct: yeah I also have no idea how it works
 eulerscheZahl: have you tinkered with some other CG APIs?
 struct: I played a bit with it but nothing big
 eulerscheZahl: create + delete account API?
 struct: no, just multi list to download replays and such
 eulerscheZahl: oh, didn't know you went that far
 eulerscheZahl: a staff member once asked me for my timeout checker while writing a bot himself (but that part isn't on heroku, would stress the API too much if public)
 struct: to check if a player had a timeout in the game?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: staff needs the same features as us :D
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Difference is you know how to use their API... :smirk:

 eulerscheZahl: "Y'a un CM&#160;?! Oo"
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: I'm far too happy to give 'you know who' the feelings to do his job...

 eulerscheZahl: nick didn't update, only on hover
 eulerscheZahl: NinjaNoodle_b54b
 eulerscheZahl: i'm WatercooledSkull when the name doesn't load
 darkhorse64: NinjaNoodle ... Broomstick flyer
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree i understand that they see the need of renaming. but the way how they did it :sob:
 darkhorse64: ^
 Illedan: It's like they are not even trying anymore
 eulerscheZahl: betraying their own heritage
 Illedan: ^
 eulerscheZahl: oh, code of the rings = brain fork. they went with my suggestion there
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't change the artwork yet
 jacek: "Othello, a variant with a change to the board's initial setup, was patented in 1971" hmmmmm
 eulerscheZahl: but it's community content

 eulerscheZahl: i mean broomstick whatever
 eulerscheZahl: cgstats even uses the new names
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: Mods: You should all take good care of our beloved CM. Because I really fear he risks a burnout. Instead of just ban me, he also deleted my main account. This extra work is not healthy.

 Illedan: Yes I did
 Illedan: And I'm doing
 Illedan: Will continue
 Illedan: Until 1st

 eulerscheZahl: i do
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: :cry:
 Westicles: oh dear
 Westicles: at least you don't have to wait a month to take the certification tests again
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: Who know? They're broken since 2 days.
 eulerscheZahl: i still haven't tried them. but don't feel like i'm missing out on anything
 Illedan: what certification tests?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: go to your profile page and click a language
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: Oh. Seems it's fixed
 Illedan: wtf
 eulerscheZahl: a certified profile: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/f6389a8319f07b08072b207feb2572c9790215">https://www.codingame.com/profile/f6389a8319f07b08072b207feb2572c9790215</a>

 BlaiseVonEbuthV: I have. But I don't know if I'll push them back. Again
 Stilgart: looks like a turte acoding in Haskell to me
 Stilgart: -a
 eulerscheZahl: more like reusing some of my code on other websites
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: but do you have a script that makes such a backup&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Stilgart: (i really need to write one)
 eulerscheZahl: blaise has one i think. zenoscave surely does
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: I don't. I just save them locally as I go.

 BlaiseVonEbuthV: Shhh... You gonna be banned! :scream:
 Illedan: Any ideas on what to throw at my FB bot to beat Re curse :thinking:
 Wontonimo: i'm assuming your are using NNs
 Illedan: Nah
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: Hm... BF you meant?
 Illedan: Not on FB
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: Anyway. No matter the game, just try humor, he will instantly give up and quit.
 Illedan: Who?
 jacek: Automaton2000 who else
 Automaton2000: you get a list of possible moves
 eulerscheZahl: &gt; Any ideas on what to throw at my FB bot to beat Re curse :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: also what is FB?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you have to swap it now: BF
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: That's what I said...&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: Illedan , here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/593641227">https://www.codingame.com/replay/593641227</a> on frame 34 you don't grab the ball that is going to the goal
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, selective reading
 eulerscheZahl: i still see you without avatar and somehow have a habit of skipping those :angel:
 BlaiseVonEbuthV: Refresh
 eulerscheZahl: never!
 jacek: reboot
 Illedan: Wontonimo, but I grab the other ball that will fire the ball below me far ahead
 Wontonimo: around frame 27 we can see that a situation was created where there were a lot of balls blitzing your goal all at once
 Illedan: Indeed
 Illedan: might be I'm using my spells too easy
 Wontonimo: perhaps a heuristic encouragement to do something similar if the conditions are right
 Illedan: Like he does?
 Illedan: All my reasoning is part of my search
 Wontonimo: yeah.  do you have anything that encourages blitzing (even if it is not explicit)
 Illedan: blitzing?
 Wontonimo: what happend around 27, where multiple balls are part of a scoring push
 Wontonimo: i'm just calling it that
 Illedan: ah
 Wontonimo: let me know if there is a better name
 jacek: blitzkrieg
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's good.
 Wontonimo: it is just shortened to 'blitz' here in Canada
 Wontonimo: I reviewed <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/593646939">https://www.codingame.com/replay/593646939</a>
 Illedan: From the current push?
 Illedan: Was testing something
 Illedan: didn't work
 Illedan: :P
 Wontonimo: yes.  if we look at the average position of all the Snaffle as a heuristic of which team is going towin, it is determined early
 Illedan: Yeah
 Wontonimo: in this replay you can see that your opponent moved enough winning balls to their goal early <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/593648706">https://www.codingame.com/replay/593648706</a>  by frame 30 they had the 'average' ball position well on their side
 Wontonimo: I have not see you use this spell before to rocket the ball to the goal <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/593649290">https://www.codingame.com/replay/593649290</a>
 Illedan: It is more expensive, so it is used less. As it is bad unless I score with it
 Wontonimo: it won the game
 Illedan: Ok, I'll do a test where I assume both spells have equal cost
 Wontonimo: in this replay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/593650228">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/593650228</a> I see that re curse is using the balls to bounce balls to good effect.  Is that something your code can do?
 Wontonimo: starting at around frame 15
 Wontonimo: the bonus of such a move is that the opponents ball is deflected and your ball is most likely close in your path again for quick recovery and reuse
 Wontonimo: I found in csb that encouraging my search to maximize collisions made it harder for my opponents to predict the future.  perhaps something like that is happening here
 eulerscheZahl: "it won the game"recurse bugging on the goal line won the game
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: you think he could have deflected?
 Wontonimo: i'm not too familiar with the rules of the game
 eulerscheZahl: look at frame 52 till the end
 eulerscheZahl: would have been 3-2 for recurse with 2 balls left
 Wontonimo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: that bug is more common than you might think
 eulerscheZahl: not only for him but pb4 too
 Wontonimo: new plan, place one ball right next to the goal to encourage bugging
 Wontonimo: :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Illedan: Yeah, that would work
 Illedan: I would be far of without that bug help xD
 Illedan: (not that far
 Illedan: )

 Automaton2000: so it is not wrong
 BartholomewIII: No, but there's hints if you need them
 jacek: what puzzle
 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: How can i get the hints?
 BartholomewIII: I think it's something on the left?
 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/neighbor-sum-grids">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/neighbor-sum-grids</a> This puzzle
 jacek: thats hard puzzle
 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: Why is there a solution option?
 BartholomewIII: So you can look at other solutions when you solve it yourself
 5DN1L: when you *have solved* it yourself
 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: hm ok, i just wanted a hint, is there a way?
 5DN1L: Read the forum, and ask questions if you're still confused: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-neighbor-sum-grids/187343">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-neighbor-sum-grids/187343</a>

 DoubleSconeFTW_ee7b: thanks
 5DN1L: you're welcome
 Westicles: I don't understand why my clash got deactivated.  It is possibly the best one ever
 Westicles: &lt;deactivated twice&gt;
 pardouin: which one?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6237c51ddaa53487af10cb313ac4631e0371">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6237c51ddaa53487af10cb313ac4631e0371</a>
 pardouin: maybe people not familiar with the notation mod
 pardouin: there are people who code and never really study arithmetics
 Westicles: Yeah, could be.  I watched that girl with an afro struggle with it on twitch, but she was talking about hairstyles for 10 minutes then panicked
 PolentaEater: I guess "random direction generator" might sound scary. It took me a while to fully understand the problem. Cool clash though!
 BartholomewIII: Westicles, maybe describe the RNG in a separate paragraph and *then* describe how the numbers choose the direction of your random walk. At the moment, you're introducing two concepts at the same time.
 franlol: FAFAFAFASFHGDFHGREKJ === F, wtf do I have to do?
 BartholomewIII: You have to give context to what you're trying to do...
 franlol: InputExpected outputFMAMJJASONDJFMAMJJASONDJFMAMJJASONDJF
 BartholomewIII: Describe the problem not the test case. Unless it's a reverse probelm
 franlol: yeah it is
 BartholomewIII: In that case, the challenge is figuring out what to do. I can't help you there
 BartholomewIII: Look for patterns, and double check the easier test cases
 TechWithTim.py: I'm using this amazing platform to help build my google kickstart score. I've been using this for 2 days and already ive seen an improevment
 Westicles: Thanks BartholomewIII.  When the other mode gets rejected I'll clean it up and try again
 Wontonimo: nice score Illedan (35.29).  Is that a bit higher than last time (was it around 32)?
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 Wontonimo: helo UZUHAMA
 UZUHAMA: hey
 xangeliczx: hellooo
 UZUHAMA: heeey
 CurryCurry: wee
 Thorcode: hi
 fooddoof: hello
 Wontonimo: what puzzles/multis is everyone working on?
 UZUHAMA: Fax machine
 Westicles: beach volleyball
 Wontonimo: you people flatter me
 Wontonimo: how's fax machine going UZUHAMA&#160;?
 Thorcode: that puzzle is nice
 Thorcode: code breaker iiss nice too
 Wontonimo: did you complete it Thor?
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: I think that puzzle should be in medium
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's what i'm thinking now
 Wontonimo: but there are just as hard puzzles in easy.  Easy is a broad range here
 Wontonimo: i think the fact that there are multiple steps and the description is very mathy 
 Wontonimo: makes it on the edge of 'easy'
 5922: There are certainly some much easier medium puzzles. With that said, there are more difficult easy puzzles.
 Wontonimo: +1
 Wontonimo: my rule-of-thumb is that if it can be solved with little more than loops then it is 'easy'
 Thorcode: bruh it should be hard
 Thorcode: There is only one unique solution to each test
 UZUHAMA: That code breaker thing is definitely not "easy"
 UZUHAMA: I wonder who decided to call it easy :thinking:
 UZUHAMA: Maybe easy for intermidiate
 UZUHAMA: Not for a baby noob like me&#160;:(
 UZUHAMA: By the way my fax machine is stuck
 Wontonimo: good job Thorcode for first implementing a caesar cipher solution&#160;!  now you just need to add the *B term&#160;!
 Thorcode: that puzzle seem hared than  mars lander 2
 Wontonimo: you are almost there Thorcode if you've solved the first 4 test cases 
 Thorcode: this puzzle makes me dizzy
 Westicles: I thought you solved it back when you were kalamariking?
 Thorcode: who is kalamariking
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode, so you've solved (X+A)%L part of code breaker.  How much more would it take to change it to ((X+A)*B)%L&#160;?
 Wontonimo: and solve for A and B instead of just A&#160;?
 Thorcode: My mind almost boom with that puzzle
 UZUHAMA: Where do I see other users' work?
 Wontonimo: once you solve the puzzle you can  navigate to the solutions page

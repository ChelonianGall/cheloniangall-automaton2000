 PavanSPalve: how and where to use opponet position parameter in bronze league for collusion
 Le_Dodo: if (posPlayer == posOpponent){ action = player.whisper('hello you' , opponent)}
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 PavanSPalve: bt there is nothing like position of player
 Le_Dodo: posOpponent = player.searchAround(everywhere, opponent)
 Le_Dodo: sorry just joking
 PavanSPalve: yaa  i know
 PavanSPalve: if u know pls tell i cant get above 700 rank
 Le_Dodo: I'm actually not playing this game but I'm sure you'll find out by yourself.
 PavanSPalve: ok ok no problem
 Le_Dodo: try to break down your issue in smaller steps
 Le_Dodo: and think from the end to the start of your algo
 Le_Dodo: at least that's what helps me everytime
 PavanSPalve: i have everything ready bt cant get in the collusion issue, boss just kicking me out
 Le_Dodo: just to be sure, you mean "collusion" or "collision"&#160;?
 PavanSPalve: collision
 Le_Dodo: here we go
 Le_Dodo: so you are playing Coders Strike Back&#160;?
 PavanSPalve: yes
 PavanSPalve: so till now i was just talking about diff stuff with no logic
 Le_Dodo: the second line of inputs is the opponentX and opponentY
 PavanSPalve: yes
 Le_Dodo: sooo
 PavanSPalve: but where to impliment that input
 Le_Dodo: you know your pos
 jrke: i have one easy algo to make gold in CSB easily just by 2 minutes of coe
 Le_Dodo: and the pos of your opponent
 PavanSPalve: no i dont
 Le_Dodo: yes you do
 PavanSPalve: i just want my location

 BlaiseEbuth: ho
 Le_Dodo: if you pass a checkpoint, you know where you are 
 Le_Dodo: right?
 Saad-py: Is C++ good for CP
 jrke: exactly blaise
 PavanSPalve: yaa that checkpoin is loc
 Saad-py: CP = competetive prog
 Saad-py:&#160;??
 jrke: CP = coding points on Codingame i think
 Saad-py: oh ok
 Le_Dodo: so when you "collide" the first checkpoint you know that you are at checkpoint's coordinate
 Saad-py: Competetive prog
 PavanSPalve: @le_Dodo  yes i m there
 Le_Dodo: and from that you can find where you are at every moment
 Le_Dodo: and if you know where you are
 Le_Dodo: and where your opponent is
 Le_Dodo: you can prevent collision
 Le_Dodo: and collusion
 PavanSPalve: yes by slowing down
 Le_Dodo: :slight_smile:
 Le_Dodo: or turning
 jrke: preventing collision is not a good solution make a collision which disturbs enemy trajectory
 Le_Dodo: let him try by himself maybe?
 PavanSPalve: ok...
 PavanSPalve: i wwill smash him
 PavanSPalve: to disturb his path
 Le_Dodo: jrke&#160;: there is no point to give the solution right away
 PavanSPalve: i was at 700+ now 100+
 PavanSPalve: 1000+
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to wait the end of your submit.
 PavanSPalve: it is after end 
 Le_Dodo: PavanSPalve&#160;: tweak and try again
 Le_Dodo: and again
 Le_Dodo: and again
 Le_Dodo: and again
 BlaiseEbuth: Are you sure all the matchs has been played&#160;? Have you 100%&#160;?
 PavanSPalve: yes i will thats only solution
 PavanSPalve: yes 100
 BlaiseEbuth: That's fast...
 PavanSPalve: no not fast it take abt 5 min
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... Fast ^^
 PavanSPalve: well we can do collision if opponnt is near to checkpoint than us
 Saad-py: SUP C++

 jrke: look at this when you crossed first checkpoint
 jrke: you can change your 0 thrust compatibility from 90 degree to 50 or 60 degree or even less also
 PavanSPalve: well note that, will try

 Char_2C: hi
 Baxtex: So I managed to win over the first boss where you get the Checkpointangle. How do I advance to the next level?
 Le_Dodo: maybe try to manage your speed
 Baxtex: So it needs to go faster?
 SeraphWeddUltimate: The basic idea is to slow down when the checkpoint angle is too large
 SeraphWeddUltimate: so that the drone's turn speed can catch up
 Baxtex: Ah yes, I did that and won
 SeraphWeddUltimate: Congratulations!
 Le_Dodo: good job Baxtex
 Baxtex: Thanks.&#160;:) But I was wondering how I can advance to the next level/boss? 
 SeraphWeddUltimate: If the performance of your bot is higher than the boss's, you will advance to the next leage automatically at the next cycle.
 Simiouch: You get promoted to the next rank automatically once you defeat the boss I think
 Baxtex: Hmm at the top it says that I am in Wood 2 League rank 12 000/46 000
 SeraphWeddUltimate: Then you're still far away from next stage. 
 Le_Dodo: keep up the good work then
 SeraphWeddUltimate: if you click leaderboard, you can see the  see the score of the boss
 SeraphWeddUltimate: compare it to your score, and if your score is higher, you will advance shortly after.
 Baxtex: I see, thanks
 SeraphWeddUltimate: Keep improving your bot until you beat the boss in terms of score! ^_^
 Baxtex: Yeah, I only thought you needed to win :P 
 Baxtex: Need to expierment a bit with the distance value I think
 Le_Dodo: good idea
 Le_Dodo: maybe start thinking about your absolute and relative positions
 SeraphWeddUltimate: yeah. Though I got stuck at bronze. Even though my bot wins almost all cases against the boss, I can't earn enough points against other coder's bots.
 GlazedDonut: Ive been stuck at the lvl 1 of "Power of thor" for like 3 days, As I finish it I get "Easy as a Pie" achievement lol I want to kms 
 VizGhar: :D :D enjoy donut, enjoy
 GlazedDonut: lol
 Baxtex: Thats my everday at work lol, but I don't even get an achivement lol :D
 GlazedDonut: :D
 VizGhar: I wonder where such huge differences in programming skills are comming from
 Baxtex: Maybe the coded a machine learning pipeline for the ultimate coordinates and the just used them instead :P 
 Wouter-J: What are some good puzzles featuring recursion?
 VizGhar: well recursion is mostly bad&#160;:) but you can try all of those tagged with recursion<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/recursion">https://www.codingame.com/learn/recursion</a>
 VizGhar: Or anything with flood-fill or bfs<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/flood-fill">https://www.codingame.com/learn/flood-fill</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/BFS">https://www.codingame.com/learn/BFS</a>
 Wouter-J: I'm trying to understand the concept / how to apply it. Those seem nice, thanks a lot!
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 jacek: to understand recursion you must understand recursion
 Wouter-J: :joy: I expected that one
 jacek: try to google recursion
 Wouter-J: That's beautiful
 Char_2C: dont forget to let the recursion and somewhere, had to end the whole program...
 -oa-: Hi! Is there anywhere I can view previous clashes to review the ones I didnt solve?
 -oa-: (I guess notification history, but unable to sort on score and view task description)
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Astrobytes: -oa-
 -oa-: Thx:)
 Passifi: So a friend of mine claims that coding with the english qwerty layout is much better than the german layout. Any germans here who have tried it out, and can confirm&#160;?
 Passifi: or other eltaed european layout too of course&#160;;)
 thanhtungphan: ich bin auslander und fur mich beide sind gleiche
 Passifi: hmm okay its not a huge difference anyways but having the brackets on the side instead of the useless metal letters , might make thing a bit smother&#160;:) 
 ErrorRazor: metal?
 Passifi: Mötorhed Mötley Cure etc.
 ErrorRazor: oh
 Passifi: germans invented these vowels to make their word look evil and cool
 Passifi: words
 ErrorRazor: I didn't know they were invented by Germans
 Passifi: I mean other langauges might have them too but I think I only ever saw them in the german alphabet
 ErrorRazor: Ö and Ä are in some Nordic languages' alphabets, but maybe those populations originate from Germany
 ErrorRazor: Having access to curly brackets without modifiers seems pretty good for coding though. I might try using the English layout. Never even thought about it before
 Passifi: It might be the only reason why america is so dominant in the field of tech *nodshead* 
 ErrorRazor: Hahaha
 jacek: the bitboarders want 8x8 amazons, hmm
 Nibsi: The only keyboard layout I can work with is US International. I live and work in Germany and write a lot of German, but I can't work with the German keyboard layout.
 Nibsi: If I want to write a letter such as ü, it's as simple as typing " first (which doesn't immediately appear) and then writing u.
 Nibsi: The only letter that's a little bit harder is ß (Eszett), but it's the only special key combination I have to remember (ctrl + alt + s)
 Amperclock: Hi, need help with a python regex. How can I invert this&#160;: (?:[a-zA-Z]\.){2,}  (I want to match anything but that)&#160;? Thx
 JLukeSkywalker: thinking of making a pokemon optimization puzzle, you pick as starter, have a series of fights where you can either capture the enemy or level up your pokemon
 JLukeSkywalker: goal is to progress as far as possible
 JLukeSkywalker: sound like something interesting?
 ErrorRazor: Interesting is the word I was about to write
 JLukeSkywalker: part 2 would be multiplayer, draft a team and fight your rival
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth launch a copyright on JLukeSkywalker.</b></p><p><img src="/a/46282060365828" /> JLukeSkywalker: would call them CGbots or something
 JLukeSkywalker: CGmon
 BlaiseEbuth: Socket Monsters
 ErrorRazor: Draft alternatively or simultaneously?
 JLukeSkywalker: probably simul, could get same teams, but i think easier to make fair
 ErrorRazor: Yeah I was thinking the teams would be identical in like every legend game
 Westicles: lkj;'
 rekaxem: i really dont like shortest mode
 ErrorRazor: That's exactly what I was about to say Westicles
 Westicles: darn cat
 JLukeSkywalker: your turn would be pick from ~4 abilities, swap characters or use items
 rekaxem: basically its impossible to win using c++ in shortest mode
 ErrorRazor: rekaxem check out the puzzle section
 rekaxem: how can i do that
 ErrorRazor: It's under Practice
 rekaxem: oh
 rekaxem: i wanna ask
 rekaxem: can we filter out shortest mode in clash of code
 ErrorRazor: Nope
 rekaxem: sad
 Uljahn: possible in private clash though
 rekaxem: oh
 BlaiseEbuth: you can filter out clash of code
 rekaxem: ok thanks
 ErrorRazor: Yeah I just do puzzles and bots instead of clash
 JLukeSkywalker: imo learning python is worth it, but yeah, there are private clashes, and you can also do the puzzles and other facets of the site
 JLukeSkywalker: the code golf is ranked based on language
 rekaxem: hm ok
 rekaxem: python isnt that good for competitive programming tho
 rekaxem: but yeah its useful
 ErrorRazor: What's competitive programming
 rekaxem: uh
 ErrorRazor: Darn chat so laggy
 rekaxem: i really dont know how to explain
 rekaxem: its just like competing with other people 
 Uljahn: so it's all besides shortest :smirk:
 rekaxem: lol yeah
 ErrorRazor: Is the goal to write code that executes faster than the opponents'?
 rekaxem: not really
 rekaxem: the goal is the solve hard problems
 ErrorRazor: Then what's the problem with python
 rekaxem: speed is just a factor
 ErrorRazor: I see
 rekaxem: there is usually runtime limits in those competition
 rekaxem: with python its not really possible to solve some of the questions
 rekaxem: but python is useful for other things like machine learning because there are lots of libraries availalbe
 BlaiseEbuth: "what's the problem with python&#160;?"... Take a seat, that's gonna take some time... :smirk:
 <b>**ErrorRazor takes a seat</b></p><p><img src="/a/56474303350574" /> <b>**BlaiseEbuth takes the opportunity and flee away.</b></p><p><img src="/a/46282060365828" /> JLukeSkywalker: are puzzles like the only good way to get XP on here?
 Westicles: Other than it is super slow and the decision to force indenting to save some semicolons, seems ok
 JLukeSkywalker: python isnt meant to be super fast, use a compiled lower lvl language for that. python is meant for quick scripting and prototyping
 JLukeSkywalker: i use it at work all the time writing like 5min scripts to do things
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... That's why it's used for everything, like web, ML, games... :3
 JLukeSkywalker: I actually use python instead of pseudo code sometimes
 <b>**Yasser is watching you.</b></p><p><img src="/a/46282060365828" /> JLukeSkywalker: write the python script, if it works, write it in C
 BlaiseEbuth: Most of python users stop at step 1
 JLukeSkywalker: testing on a folder of 10 files, python it, convert to C when it works to work with a 100000 file directory system
 JLukeSkywalker: but yeah, most people would still stop at python
 JLukeSkywalker: which I think is sad
 Uljahn: better done than perfect
 JLukeSkywalker: in the time it takes your python code to run though, you could have converted it to C and finished running it a while ago
 JLukeSkywalker: in bigger applications
 TBali: &gt; are puzzles like the only good way to get XP on here?Actually reaching Legend in all the multis pays also good XP.
 JLukeSkywalker: lol, im a long way from that&#160;:)
 JLukeSkywalker: almost gold in a couple
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, but waiting for the python script, you can take a break... :3
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^ Truth
 TBali: outside multis, 45k XP is about the max you can get
 rekaxem: lmao
 TBali: (Wel Westicles proved otherwise, but that backdoor is closed now)
 BlaiseEbuth: You can create a community contest. Oh wait. No you can't&#160;! :grinning:
 rekaxem: i will probably win the shortest mode im in rn cuz people couldnt even solve the problem
 TBali: you can make 100s of accepted contribs
 JLukeSkywalker: makes 3 smurf accounts to accept every contribution ...
 TBali: OR - you cann solve all the cca 400 solo puzzles for 20k XP
 JLukeSkywalker: huh, wouldnt do that, but would that actually work?
 JLukeSkywalker: the smurfing
 VizGhar: JLukeSkywalker looks like your interests are matching mine. Not the best one in multis but still going for multiplayer contributions :D
 BlaiseEbuth: You can create randoms reverses coc, no need of statements, create 3 alts count and accept your own contribution to get, what&#160;? 250xp each time&#160;?
 Westicles: big bang theory was smurfed, they all got banned except the contrib author
 ErrorRazor: I don't get the appeal behind xp
 JLukeSkywalker: just wanna hit 20 for the quest, otherwise dont ccare
 Westicles: yeah, I was surprised to see the word gamification use positively, never seen that before
 ErrorRazor: Wanting to complete the quest map I can understand
 BlaiseEbuth: Xp is a cryptomoney. From lvl30 you can convert it to $.
 rekaxem: really
 ErrorRazor: Lol the amount of miner bots that would bring
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm lvl 100+, but I already converted more than 80 of my lvls.
 zhoubou: Did it make you a millionaire?
 BlaiseEbuth: :money_mouth:
 zhoubou: Alright then. I'm quitting my job and joining CG ranks.
 AntiSquid: level is so important that after 50+ you get hunted down and forced to sign a work contract at gunpoint
 ErrorRazor: Is there a salary?
 AntiSquid: yes, it's called taking pride in what you do
 ErrorRazor: Sounds lovely
 [Kian-carling]: hi
 ErrorRazor: Hello
 [Kian-carling]: sup
 [Kian-carling]: soooooooo
 [Kian-carling]: um you good at programming
 ErrorRazor: Not me but someone in this chat probably is
 [Kian-carling]: oh ok
 [Kian-carling]: sooooooooooooo
 [Kian-carling]: ummmmmmm brb
 AntiSquid: so ban if you keep at it
 [Kian-carling]: oh no no no sry

 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yeah... Saw this
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm too
 AntiSquid: anything with short time spawn will autoskip, anyone else can have fun if that's their thing
 eulerscheZahl: if it's an additional event, I don't carebut if they plan to replace the real contests...
 BlaiseEbuth: Waiting 6 months for 4 hours... And I don't like speed competitions...
 JLukeSkywalker: as they are now, if im busy i can still do the contest. if its only a 3-4 hour timeframe, will never be able to do it ever again
 JLukeSkywalker: will always have some sort of conflict
 eulerscheZahl: if i want a short contest, I go to codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: on that field I see them more competent than CG
 AntiSquid: Yasser practicing forum necromancy, that's a 5 year old thread
 [Kian-carling]: back
 JLukeSkywalker: gratz
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/xptf32">https://prnt.sc/xptf32</a>this valuable feedback on my contribution :D
 [Kian-carling]: cool
 ErrorRazor: lmao
 [Kian-carling]: i got a code i'm working on
 [Kian-carling]: ok bye
 BlaiseEbuth: But, hey, that's not like if our opinions, as 1.64% members, have any importance. :3
 eulerscheZahl: correct, now we want contests for the 98.36% as well
 eulerscheZahl: as a member of the 1.64% i'm able to compute the difference to 100% without a calculator :trophy:
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 JLukeSkywalker: *praise
 struct: oh god 4 hours contest
 AntiSquid: where does it say it will be 4&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: prep the red-bull
 struct: Im just assuming 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM</a>
 struct: Next thing I want is a starter pack where I just need to tune eval function
 struct: So I dont have to spend time coding
 linjoehan: lol struct just write one
 BlaiseEbuth: Next thing I want is a contest with me as the known winner. So I dont have to spend time coding...
 BlaiseEbuth: Why tetris&#160;?
 linjoehan: mm a multi with if username = BlaiseEbuth he wins. you will have to code the multi though
 JLukeSkywalker: lol, do it, the community might not notice and approve it
 eulerscheZahl: the referee doesn't get the username, only JS can access it
 JLukeSkywalker: cant gamemanager get the nickname?
 BlaiseEbuth: AutomatonNN&#160;: euler
 AutomatonNN: funny thing
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 linjoehan: I thought it could get it
 eulerscheZahl: only nicknametoken
 Westicles: i bet they make the contests team.  kids love teams
 eulerscheZahl: which is "%1", "%2", ...
 linjoehan: On the other hand I was thinking of making a tetris multi but MK talked me out of it sort of
 AntiSquid: you can join kaggle for that struct, but you can still expand on things, it's not as simple as you think, things don't just end there
 eulerscheZahl: gets replaced in js
 eulerscheZahl: so if the user changes the nick, you see the new one
 Astrobytes: eww solo contests
 eulerscheZahl: team contests?
 AntiSquid: is solo contest synonym for puzzle contest?
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: now i see the twitter post in a new context
 JLukeSkywalker: team contest might be cool, make a multi where score based on working together?
 AntiSquid: fun morbius strip guaranteed?
 struct: Well its still bad if its for puzzles
 Astrobytes: tric trac has already made a semi-cooperative game, it's waiting for approval
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928">https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928</a>
 linjoehan: more like an optimisitation problem with a CTWC feel to it was what I was thinking but it may be a bit to simple
 BlaiseEbuth: :fireworks:
 eulerscheZahl: and we have code a la mode
 eulerscheZahl: and yeah: CG contests are almost always a little buggy. which hurts much more in a 4h contest than 10 days
 linjoehan: how about a 4v4 version of that soccer game?
 AntiSquid: but that at least looks like something new and interesting not a sprint
 struct: I doubt its related to contests
 struct: Why did they not talk about it in discord disccusion?
 Astrobytes: If there's another 4 hour puzzle contest I delete
 Astrobytes: (not really)
 eulerscheZahl: if there's another 4h contest i ban automaton
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I rather have a coc contest than a 4 hour contest
 reCurse: I just wish they'd tell us now so I can ragequit in peace and move on
 mzbear: 4h contest = it's guaranteed to happen at unreasonable hours for some players
 eulerscheZahl: rumors say raic will host contests more frequently
 struct: I dont mind 4 hours contest, what bothers me is that it will probably replace a normal contest...
 reCurse: Is that really the only alternative now? :cry:
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: they said they're definitely doing a mini-raic at least
 BlaiseEbuth: You can make your own alternative
 reCurse: Maybe I should quit this hobby altogether then
 AntiSquid: there's always the choice to bot browser games :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: back to real gaming?
 Astrobytes: Gardening perhaps?
 eulerscheZahl: skiing. might have a brighter future than bot contests
 Astrobytes: heh
 AntiSquid: well Astrobytes, Bill Gates bought farmland so probably yes&#160;! :D
 AntiSquid: he's ahead again
 mzbear: woodworking could be a fun hobby.  you could write code for cnc machines
 Astrobytes: Even better: become a lumberjack
 Westicles: hmm, what's the story with deleting approvals?
 struct: what do you mean Westicles?
 Astrobytes: I suspect he refers to Robin Hood
 Westicles: yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: What about him&#160;? I missed something&#160;?
 Westicles: notifications say he approved a couple, but they are gone
 Astrobytes: Yes, the Sheriff of Nottingham finally caught him.
 struct: 48 new players
 struct: 0 completed puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: you can turn off the notifications for approval votes if you don't like the spam&#160;;)
 Westicles: Was that something official, or someone acting unilaterally again?
 struct: Moderators cant remove the vote
 struct: just the comment
 eulerscheZahl: i'm with Blaise, I totally missed what the discussion is about
 Astrobytes: Not sure, but I know CG keep an eye out for Robin Hood
 BlaiseEbuth: :shrug:
 Westicles: Robinhood approved two of my puzzles earlier and now they are gone
 Astrobytes: Friar Tuck did it.
 eulerscheZahl: approved as in 3rd and final vote?
 Westicles: 2nd
 Astrobytes: 2nd.
 eulerscheZahl: robin hood himself can undo the vote
 eulerscheZahl: and CG staff of course
 Astrobytes: Yes, but I don't see why he would. Probably staff.
 eulerscheZahl: but no mention on the moderators channel
 Astrobytes: Unless Robin nicely used his brain to constrate.
 Westicles: heh heh.  well no big deal, these two are actually good ones
 AntiSquid: does he have multiple accounts? (robinhood)
 Astrobytes: Donno. Perhaps he has a Little John or Maid Marian account...
 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 AntiSquid: anyone can become robin hood, they just need a hoody and commit some robin

 BlaiseEbuth: France surrendered but still won... :yum:
 Westicles: might not win this one though...
 vinacal: my code don't pass 100%, how i can see test case to fix it
 JLukeSkywalker: print it out
 JLukeSkywalker: the input
 vinacal: my code don't pass 1 validater, when i submit
 JLukeSkywalker: what problem
 yohyoh: :grin:
 vinacal: validators is differ from puzzle test cases. When i submit code, print it out not work. I guess i must create some test case by myself
 JLukeSkywalker: what puzzle
 JLukeSkywalker: also the validator is supposed to be different, so that people dont try to cheat
 vinacal: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/prefix-code">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/prefix-code</a>
 MichelGrolet: m
 JLukeSkywalker: did you pass all of the test cases?
 vinacal: yes, all test case
 Westicles: which one do you fail?
 AntiSquid: oh one of those puzzles: IF CLAUSE THEN PRINT THIS SPECIAL MSG otherwise do the actual puzzle
 AntiSquid: you need to give the index though, maybe; maybe it's not that bad

 BlaiseEbuth: lel
 eulerscheZahl: mine is 0x27
 drdrdr: hola
 eulerscheZahl: you are not dbdr
 Westicles: here come the triggered clashers
 Westicles: roman numerals in 38s?
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Katespizer: should auto publishing work in clash of code? or is it for something else 
 AntiSquid: optional is good
 AntiSquid: freedom of choice&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: auto publish only applies for classic puzzles
 AntiSquid: hey anyone know a good email to pdf converter? trying to convert emails with image attachments to pdf files and keep them somewhat as readable as they are displayed in the email manager 
 mzbear: antisquid, just print them as pdf?
 mzbear: every major OS should have some kind of "print to file" system these days
 AntiSquid: on thunderbird i get almost plain text pdf
 AntiSquid: *.prn extension file? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like 18+ rated files
 TBali: Clicking on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/rubik%E2%80%99s-cube">https://www.codingame.com/learn/rubik%E2%80%99s-cube</a> brings me to a nice page:My progress:  NaN%
 jacek: nani?
 TBali: Of course it is not a number, moron, it is a oercentage...&#160;:-)
 TBali: p
 TBali: Does it works for others?
 jacek: nope. NaN
 TBali: Most likely the apostroph 
 TBali: There is no such puzlle as "Rubik's Cube"
 TBali: only Rubik(R), Doubly solved Rubik..., 1x1x1 Rubik, 2x2x2 Rubik....
 TBali: By the way in its home country we call it "Magic Cube" 
 TBali:&#160;:)
 TBali: Maybe in Socialism it was not proper to name something after a living person.
 TBali: (unless he is a communist leader...)
 AntiSquid: oh linux gives me a pdf, win 10 requires me to install something like CutePDF
 TBali: I used to use BullZip PDF
 AntiSquid: missing a lot of the images though&#160;:/
 TBali: but not anymore, built in Office PDF support is good enough
 AntiSquid: don't have MS office
 TBali: BullZip is installed as a fake printer.
 TBali: But it will not take care of teh email attachments I am afraid
 jacek: you cant open pdf in chrome?
 eulerscheZahl: TBali i changed one of the tags to bundle the puzzles under the same tag
 jacek: ohhh, another explit? :imp:
 eulerscheZahl: what's an explit?
 TBali: oit
 jacek: explicit exploit
 TBali: euler, if you want to practice recursion or endless loops, there are many puzzles for that&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: endless as in infinite?
 eulerscheZahl: recursion: i vaguely remember hearing about that concept, should definitely practice
 TBali: I just learned that Rust even spared an extra keyword for infinite loops
 TBali: "loop" is shortcut (?) for "while (true)"
 TBali: Don't understand why was that necessary
 eulerscheZahl: you don't golf i suppose
 TBali: Nah, that sport is for snobs.
 TBali: There is a course 1km from where I live, but did not check the club fees
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if troll but probably you are
 struct: euler with the modified sdk is it also possible to change the 50ms minimum?
 TBali:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 TBali: don'T golf in Rust, for sure
 eulerscheZahl: @struct
 TBali: 15 mins not enough to conquer the borrow checker in swordfight
 struct: port halite :D
 eulerscheZahl: which one?
 struct: Never played any of them
 Astrobytes: still think something based on the last raic would work
 struct: astro only with modified sdk
 Astrobytes: (using the grid debug view)
 Astrobytes: struct: I don't mean with huge turns and stuff
 struct: I think the game needs a good ammount of turns
 struct: more than 150 turns per player
 struct: But I could be wrong, I did not play it
 Astrobytes: It would have to be a smaller CG version, not a straight copy, that just wouldn't work
 struct: Also I would need to change pathfinding after 2 weeks of release
 struct: for true RAIC experience
 AntiSquid: how was your RAIC experience this time? did anyone enjoy it?
 AntiSquid: completely skipped it
 eulerscheZahl: when you don't try to get all-in, RAIC can be fun
 eulerscheZahl: this one was pretty solid
 eulerscheZahl: in fact the last big no-no RAIC was 2016 IMO
 Notgoodatcoding5: I got 90% on my test for school so yay!
 Astrobytes: I really enjoyed raic too
 Astrobytes: Think most liked it tbh
 eulerscheZahl: squid is biased because of ranking noise and missing the tshirt in a previous round
 Astrobytes: ah, that's unfortunate
 eulerscheZahl: lots of bot with similar strength in that range so there is some randomness of course
 DoubleComet_7201: hey
 DoubleComet_7201: im unmuted
 DoubleComet_7201: pog
 Katespizer: if i close chat of clash, do i still gget notifed&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: was the ranking anti squid&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you again
 jacek: Katespizer yes
 Katespizer: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: that's not a complete sentence BlaiseEbuth, you made my parser fail
 eulerscheZahl: aah, got it:D
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:)
 jacek: that was my style&#160;:&lt;
 Astrobytes: lol, slow toad day today
 Astrobytes: lol, was that a pre-emptive strike BlaiseEbuth?
 reCurse: Pre-empted mine at least
 Astrobytes: I had it typed out ready to go
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope. I just couldn't ban him while he was not in the chat.
 AntiSquid: pulled an all nighter waiting for revenge&#160;? :P
 AntiSquid: euler i missed shirt due to soft rank reset on resub, was hoping to climb faster because my bot was indeed winning more, problem however was that if you do soft reset on rank you are automatically dropped 50 ranks or more before first game
 AntiSquid: i skipped this raic because it was halite III all over again, you get bored at some point, don't you?
 reCurse: It's not halite all over again if there's no synergy bonus or whatever it was called
 eulerscheZahl: from watching i didn't see halite eitherand I didn't play halite, so i couldn't get sick of it
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. RAIC was more about fighting and not just harvesting
 eulerscheZahl: and you had to harvest a cell first to be able to enter it
 reCurse: There was no fighting in halite 3, just questionable suicide bombing
 drdrdr: hola
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I meant
 eulerscheZahl: and RAIC had no drop zones, you instantly got the resources
 eulerscheZahl: so less micro management (unless you play to win)
 reCurse: Can't believe raic is almost attractive now, really need a new outlet

 jacek: cg-chan?
 BlaiseEbuth: there's a "something-chan" wiki... :expressionless:
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like where this chat is going
 AntiSquid: we need to create our own jacek! a great contribution to this wonderful community
 eulerscheZahl: you weirdos
 Uljahn: Automaton2000-chan
 Automaton2000: how do u know how to see the answer

 AntiSquid: is that the important question?
 dylanz: what?

 BlaiseEbuth: where?
 Astrobytes: Chat. I left for a few minutes and suddenly there's chans and brony talk
 BlaiseEbuth: isn't the magic word "abracadabra"&#160;?

 struct: lichess added puzzle storm :D
 AntiSquid: kinda sexist, calling everyone a guy, there are 50 genders darling
 ErrorRazor: Do you play chess with a bot or by yourself
 ErrorRazor: Ok that was poorly worded
 Astrobytes: Puzzle storm? Speed puzzles?
 AntiSquid: with bot
 ErrorRazor: Do you play chess like normal people or do you make a program that plays it?
 struct: yes Astrobytes
 struct: like puzzle rush
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 Charm_wolf: i gtg i gotta do a project
 AntiSquid: are you saying people who built chess engines aren't normal?
 jacek:&#160;:(
 ErrorRazor: I think I'm allowed to say it because I'm a CodinGamer myself
 samuel_wondimu: how to round 1.5 to 1 in javascript
 struct: Math.floor()
 jacek: -0.5 [solved]
 AntiSquid: forgot, don't you need to cast to int also?
 samuel_wondimu: if i do minous 0.5 other valuse returns unwanted value
 BlaiseEbuth: rtfm
 AntiSquid: might have a bug somewhere samuel_wondimu
 ErrorRazor: Do you want to floor if the fraction is .5 or less and ceil otherwise?
 eulerscheZahl: you should better specify what rounding you want
 eulerscheZahl: what is round(1.6)?
 eulerscheZahl: what is round(2.5)
 jacek: what is love
 eulerscheZahl: round(-0.5)
 eulerscheZahl: nullpointer exception jacek
 Tank1334: @jackek open source is love
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no error in js
 eulerscheZahl: only arrow
 eulerscheZahl: =&gt;
 AntiSquid: forced co-op like code a la mode of sorts jacek
 zhoubou: In JS, errors ask you:VM41232:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: what is not defined
 BlaiseEbuth: If you have an error in js, just add it to an integer, should works.
 struct: trictrac if I resize the board to 8x8 should I keep 8 pieces total?
 Astrobytes: 8x8!
 Astrobytes: But imo yes, still 8
 jacek: those bitboarders...
 Astrobytes: hehe, well you can still bitboard 10x10, just more work
 trictrac: hello struct, sorry for my late answer, I was not in front my PC. you can keep all the pieces even in an 8x8 board
 Astrobytes: Maybe 10x10 is too much for CG constraints
 struct: thanks, I failed to create the league
 struct: Ill try again
 struct: Dont know what I did wrong
 struct: ok updated, also stub needs to be reseted 
 jacek: made boss?
 struct: yes
 struct: print("random")
 trictrac: hello every one, no one to review "fireworks" and to put the last approval&#160;?
 ErrorRazor: Can anyone approve?
 ErrorRazor: Or do you need to be at a certain level
 trictrac: only level up to 20
 ErrorRazor: Well then I can't
 struct: I will try this week tric trac
 trictrac: ok thanks
 Astrobytes: trictrac: from my testing everything is good but since I do not have a working bot just yet I am hesitant to approve
 trictrac: I understand, it's fair
 jacek: demo is still 10x10
 struct: demo is
 struct: I cant change demo based on the league
 struct: just change the league
 jacek: ahh so first league is 8x8 and second is 10x10?
 struct: yes
 struct: I kept both so people can test I guess
 struct: I have no rush to approve it
 jacek: nice transition between rounds
 ErrorRazor: (where) can I see multi contribs?
 struct: Thanks
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>
 Astrobytes: In the Contribution section, unfortunately mixed in with all the other contribs
 struct: oh there is a filter
 struct: to filter coc
 struct: I didnt know
 Astrobytes: Yeah but puzzles are still mixed with multis
 trictrac: struct&#160;: for amazons, it can be cool to have a random positionning of the queen @ the start
 struct: you mean make first move random?
 struct: or different queen setups?
 trictrac: different queen setups
 struct: ok, should I also randomize starting positions?
 struct: So they dont start always at corners
 trictrac: yes symetrie but not @ corners
 trictrac: symetrie for the 2 players
 Astrobytes: I think this is worth trying
 struct: Could they start at middle of the map?
 struct: or just edges?
 trictrac: even in the middle. It's just a proposal&#160;: the idea needs to be challenged
 Astrobytes: It's interesting because I haven't come across this variation, only board size
 Astrobytes: It has to be tested
 Astrobytes: The implications aren't immediately obvious (to me at least)
 struct: ok I will add  this
 struct: If this is good I will completely scratch the 10x10 board
 Astrobytes: 8 multis pending... (9 inc. TvC)
 Astrobytes: At least you can take your time with this one struct
 reCurse: Imagine having competition of the month... ha ha ha
 reCurse: haaaa
 jacek:&#160;?
 reCurse: So much wasted potential
 Astrobytes: You read the discord 'meeting' jacek
 jacek: where
 reCurse: There
 Astrobytes: There on the stair
 struct: I would like to know the server cost it takes to run a contest
 Westicles: better question is how much to buy all user email addresses from CG
 Astrobytes: You don't have to. Just run a sponsored contest and bcc everyone who registered when it finishes...
 Astrobytes: cc
 Astrobytes: You could probably message CG about that struct
 reCurse: If you have to ask you can't afford it
 Astrobytes: Check the costs of Halite...
 struct: is it available?
 reCurse: I had some numbers a long time ago
 reCurse: Unfortunately I forgot and not sure how easy to dig them back
 reCurse: I vaguely recall some napkin calculation in the 5 digits of US dollars
 struct: What was the duration of halite contests?
 reCurse: Possible they had a discount with google though
 reCurse: 3 months
 struct: Also the submits was N ammount of battles like CG?
 Astrobytes: It was a hedge fund that ran Halite though... so...
 reCurse: Continuous games
 reCurse: They had GPU workers too so it ups the costs
 reCurse: And 2 secs per turn
 reCurse: It's very possible to reduce the costs significantly with CG-like constraints
 struct: and it was 400-500 turns
 struct: damn
 Astrobytes: Like I said, investment companies can afford that&#160;;)What did you have in mind struct? Crowdfunding something?
 reCurse: Having money is a poor indicator of how you spend it
 jacek: cryptocurrencies!
 struct: I was just trying to understand CG
 reCurse: There's one big reason you can't really reproduce though
 reCurse: It's reach
 jacek: oO
 reCurse: That's why some companies have really stupid valuations
 Astrobytes: True reCurse, but in the case of Two Sigma I believe it was a marketing exercise first and foremost
 reCurse: It's not about the product but about your userbase
 reCurse: It was a recruitment exercise actually
 reCurse: Probably coupled with marketing too but still
 reCurse: They had a heavy recruit focus
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just marketing themselves as opposed to anything else
 reCurse: Hackathons in high schools and whatnot
 Astrobytes: I think they said something about getting their name out their
 Astrobytes: *there
 reCurse: I think it's an initiative that died a horrible death, not sure the real cause
 reCurse: There was a massive shift in tone between H2 and H3
 Astrobytes: In what way?
 reCurse: Their involvement
 Astrobytes: They backed off from it?
 reCurse: They handled their community spectacularly well in H2
 reCurse: In H3 it was very hands off
 Astrobytes: Interesting.
 reCurse: I had to poke several times to get the prize in H3, even got a response alluding there was no such thing, had to quote their own website
 reCurse: It was weird
 Astrobytes: Oooh, that's a strange one.New top-level management perhaps?
 reCurse: It was handled by a different person
 reCurse: Persons even
 reCurse: But anyway there were plenty of subtle signs things were very different
 reCurse: Unsurprising it died after tbh
 Astrobytes: I mean they might have had some 'restructuring' and the new placements weren't keen on or were unaware of the whole thing.
 reCurse: From my understanding it was an effort some people were doing in addition to their actual job
 reCurse: So I assume they left or moved on or something somewhere between H2 and H3
 Astrobytes: Oh I see. Someone probably didn't want to continue financing that then.
 reCurse: You can't replace dedication
 Astrobytes: Very true indeed.
 Astrobytes: I was going to bring dedication into a CG context there but I'll bite my lip
 reCurse: Yeah it's getting old
 reCurse: As soon as I find another hobby I'm out of here :p
 Angecide: trying to not paying the promised prices sounds really shady ngl
 reCurse: I wouldn't put it under malicious
 reCurse: More like there was a transition and things weren't communicated
 Angecide: ah right
 Astrobytes: That's a real f'ing shame reCurse, you know that eh
 reCurse: Besides the prizes was just some swag and a trophy
 reCurse: But you know, it's cool to have
 reCurse: Besides trophies are cool, I'd rather have that than all the other prizes CG gave away tbh :p
 reCurse: Opinions obviously differ
 Astrobytes: Like I said before, you can display them in the bathroom and force people to see them when they go :P
 reCurse: You have a weird mind
 Astrobytes: No. I have an auntie (married in not blood-relative) who was briefly in a girl band in the 80s and has a gold disc from Norway or something. It was all her idea.
 Astrobytes: Insufferable person.
 MSmits: if you have no trophy's you can just use rubber duckies
 reCurse:&#160;?
 MSmits: ahh you dont know the reference, sec
 Astrobytes: Rayman?

 MSmits: ye, he's funny though
 Westicles: replying to spam guy
 MSmits: o
 Angecide: recurse how do you envision a new hobby, do you think it will still be bot related or maybe machine learning or something else entirely?
 Astrobytes: inb4 lumberjacking and moose riding
 Astrobytes: :P
 reCurse: Haven't given it that much thought yet
 reCurse: All I know is there's a post-CG and the writing is on the wall
 Astrobytes: Just gotta grab the moose by the antlers right
 Astrobytes: (sorry)
 AntiSquid: step into politics
 Astrobytes: He said post-CG, not CG
 Astrobytes: Do you play any instruments reCurse?
 reCurse: No
 Astrobytes: Musically inclined in any way? Or curious?
 reCurse: Not really. Besides I wasn't really meaning the kind of crazy turnaround you seem fond of
 AntiSquid: you could be the next gordon ramsey if you tried hard enough
 reCurse: Even though starting a goat farm sounds lovely
 Astrobytes: Hehe, no I was just taking the piss before. Music is a good hobby.
 AntiSquid: all the goat cheese recipes
 Astrobytes: I was unfortunately cursed with a brain that swings between technical and creative so I go through phases and need an outlet.
 reCurse: Doesn't sound so bad
 Astrobytes: It's not great. Useful but not great.I remember when I was in school I wasn't allowed to do art, music, all 3 science fields, tech drawing and computing - only a small subset of them.
 Astrobytes: (in addition to mathematics, English etc)
 reCurse: Specialization is overrated anyway
 AntiSquid: you mean biting off more than you can chew? astro
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't get me wrong, it's useful finding creative solutions to technical issues and vice versa but it's when you sometimes feel more of one than the other is annoying.
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: I was more than capable (at the time at least :D )
 Westicles: all right that's it, I'm going to med school
 Astrobytes: I did my biology degree later in life, after I ended my cheffing career - anything is possible.
 Astrobytes: Well, partially while I was doing it but w/e
 AntiSquid: isn't it cheaper for americans to get their degrees abroad?
 Westicles: I doubt it.  grad school is free in tech fields if you are any good
 AntiSquid: the only advantage to cheffing now is that you can be your own home chef LOL
 Astrobytes: Tell me about it. So many of my friends are out of work.
 Astrobytes: Here and abroad.
 AntiSquid: ya all fked up, always thinking it was a lucky last minute dodge there ...
 AntiSquid: norway has a good system for people to change careers, right? maybe every country should look into it
 Astrobytes: Not sure. I've a good mate in Sweden and they've totally fked the hospitality industry.
 reCurse: I'm really curious if/when those industries are going to pickup again
 therealbeef: pretty quick, no? many people have money to spend and desparate for some holiday
 AntiSquid: you'll have big chains, people are lazy to cook / don't learn it 
 reCurse: Yeah I guess I meant more the 'normal' parts
 reCurse: Of course the big chains are there
 reCurse: But the tens of thousands of small companies that closed down and still will
 reCurse: Can't bring that back up in a snap
 Astrobytes: Well, I can only speak for the UK and we already killed our economy and smaller businesses with the Brexit debacle, add covid repercussions and we're not recovering in any sector any time soon
 reCurse: True, that timing though
 HolmgrownCoder: This is like the hardest thing i have ever tried to learn. The info just WILL. NOT. GO. IN. lol
 Astrobytes: It was gonna be terrible with or without covid but yeah, right
 Westicles: you guys are bumming each other out.  just give euler a 3rd vote and have a contest already
 therealbeef: well, due to brexit UK is now at 10% vacc'ed while EU is at 1%
 therealbeef: at the current rate I'll get vacc'ed in 2025
 Westicles: In the US, half the population is trying to cheat to get it, the other half cheat to avoid it
 Astrobytes: Don't get me started therealbeef&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Assuming a perfect rollout I'm scheduled for 2022 if it's any consolation (like that will happen)
 AntiSquid: therealbeef it's only first dose atm given out
 AntiSquid: at least in my area
 Astrobytes: Yeah same squiddy
 AntiSquid: 2nd dose to be given in 12 weeks
 therealbeef: that 1% here is also only first shot&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: On the plus side, us Scots are gonna have another independence referendum if the SNP win in May
 reCurse: The worst part is currently it seems like the vision stops at getting vaccines
 reCurse: A lot of people imagine that's the end of the tunnel
 AntiSquid: go volunteer for a vac center and i bet you can get the shot very quickly therealbeef, if you want it that is
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's extremely short-sighted
 Westicles: when you say independence, you mean joining EU?
 Astrobytes: If all goes well, covid will become either endemic or seasonal
 AntiSquid: how's Texaxit&#160;? there's only rumbles
 Astrobytes: Westicles: Just getting away from these idiots in Westminster
 Westicles: I don't know... having your own currency is pretty smart these days
 Astrobytes: EU membership does not mean getting the euro
 Westicles: oh, well that would be fine
 Astrobytes: EU membership is not perfect, massive reforms are needed, but leaving it means you have not a snowball's chance in hell of even influencing it.
 AntiSquid: the issue was UK gave up a position where they had a huge say in EU, just to argue over some deals now
 Westicles: I guess it depends a bit on how you feel about islam
 AntiSquid: islam doesn't come from europe
 Astrobytes: Well, that's how they framed the referendum.
 Westicles: I mean immigration
 AntiSquid: huge amount of it was / is from outside EU, so again ...
 Astrobytes: For instance, they said the EU were going to let Turkey join! TURKEY! ALL THOSE TURKS... COMING OVER 'ERE! - then after Brexit promptly did a nice little deal with Erdogan
 AntiSquid: and within EU it does go both ways, see the tons of british holiday makers in spain
 Astrobytes: The whole thing is a nonsense.
 Astrobytes: It breaks my heart quite frankly.
 AntiSquid: did UK do any major deal with China yet? EU seems to be on their way already
 Astrobytes: Not sure. Has Boris called them some kind of derogatory name yet?
 AntiSquid: he doesn't have to, just recognize Taiwan as a separate country
 Westicles: Do you guys get much press on the french republican values charter?  It pops up on the radar here now and again
 AntiSquid: i don't watch news on TV ... checking stuff left and right and mostly follow somewhat independent journalism
 AntiSquid: i also watch this channel, quite interesting insight on US&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7vFlErTHxVD-IFNB-BFCg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7vFlErTHxVD-IFNB-BFCg</a> Westicles
 Astrobytes: We should recognise Taiwan as independent imo
 Astrobytes: Hm. Youtube news eh
 AntiSquid: sure, we should also recognize the uyghur camps
 AntiSquid: "youtube" news hahah, he should do backups on bitchute or something
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: You're damn right we should.Westicles: some initiative from young Manu Macron regarding muslims or something.
 Astrobytes: Anyway. I see where this conversation is going to go. gn

 Marchete: btw converting data to base65535 is worse in CG, some UTF takes 2 chars. I used Base16k and it seems better
 Marchete: either:

 jxsxtx03: why this page does not reconogize the&#160;%, for example in order to know the divisors. I use C
 jacek:&#160;% in C is modulo. should work in C regardless if its CG or not
 KiwiTae: maybe he thinks he is using C but he isnt
 KiwiTae: hehe
 jxsxtx03: ey
 jxsxtx03: im using c xd
 KiwiTae: wanna share your code&#160;?
 jxsxtx03: but this dont reconogize% ( modulo) , it shows me an arithmetic error

 nulte: on ept should I return the state evaluation or should I return 1 or -1 if my state is better/worse than opponent?
 AstroHydes: Depends. Using the eval is jacekmax-y
 AstroHydes: I use the eval in Oware, scaled to between 0 and 1
 AstroHydes: Or something like that
 nulte: guess ill try both ways
 AstroHydes: Yeah, experiment with it

 Noyotens: CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2021 date&#160;???
 inoryy: between 01/09/21 and 31/12/21
 Astrobytes: Might not be bot programming though . . . 
 inoryy: what?!
 Astrobytes: The decision has not yet been "made"
 Astrobytes: From the forum:"The format of the challenge hasn’t been decided yet."
 inoryy:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Not particularly encouraging. We can hope though I suppose.
 inoryy: what's the reason?
 Astrobytes: No reason given afaik
 martinpapa69: maybe its getting hard to come up with something fresh, new
 Westicles: highly skilled bot guys don't need help getting jobs
 inoryy: but they do need a place to have fun though
 martinpapa69: working in ai development is not more entertaining after a few years, than cleaning toilets
 inoryy: not sure I agree in general, but I'm sorry to hear if that was your experience
 MSmits: I did not know toilet cleaning could be that much fun
 Marchete: a wild Smits appeared!
 inoryy: I went from literally cleaning toilets to working in AI, can confirm AI is a bit more fun
 MSmits: indeed, i was on vacation last week, if you're wondering&#160;:)
 Marchete: back from holidays?
 Marchete: ok
 MSmits: my wife doesn't want me to tell you when I am leaving, cuz you'll break into our house
 MSmits: so that's why i just disappeared :P
 Marchete: oh, I'm comfortable breaking in with you two inside :eyes:
 MSmits: lol
 Marchete: ok that was a bit creepy, jk
 inoryy: you're joking that it was a bit creepy?
 MSmits: i knew that :P
 nulte: damn, I missed a chance on getting the c4 book&#160;:(
 MSmits: hey I made my nim solver for D&amp;B about 20 times faster
 nulte: 20 times?
 Marchete: only 20x?
 MSmits: (not score solver, nim solver)
 MSmits: yeah, it's still a magnitude slower than rank 1
 MSmits: but i easily beat everyone below me
 MSmits: so at least I am a comfortable rank 2 for now
 MSmits: but not done yet
 nulte: I finished the 1st version of bt, full rollout is not that bad
 nulte: At least ranking wise
 MSmits: you mean random rollout?
 nulte: yes
 MSmits: so no eval
 nulte: yeap
 MSmits: ah good to know. I never tried it
 nulte: But it plays bad
 nulte: It sacrifices to many pieces
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/570667881">https://www.codingame.com/replay/570667881</a> my bot starts crying when it's a solved nim-loss. See how much slower it still is compared to nr 1
 nulte: Whats the difference between "Win" and "win"
 MSmits: not sure, i think he accidentally capitalized it somewhere
 inoryy: Marchete please don't take it the wrong way but I found it hilarious you figured out all the bits and pieces behind your CGZero work but couldn't figure out what regularization is
 MSmits: happens to me all the time, doing a ton of smart stuff and getting tripped up by something basic.
 inoryy: "So I assembled my own car but this cup holder thing I couldn't figure out so I threw it out"
 MSmits: thats what happens when you figure out everything yourself
 Daporan: Isn't regularization pretty much a field on its own? Not so simple then in my opinion.
 inoryy: there's layers to it of course but even majority of experts don't really think about it beyond "just stick L2 norm to the loss and forget about it"
 inoryy: i.e. this is sufficient for majority of practitioners  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/regularization-for-simplicity/l2-regularization">https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/regularization-for-simplicity/l2-regularization</a>
 Daporan: I knew about L2, but thanks&#160;;)
 Marchete: now I know what it is
 Marchete: and how to use it
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: in my own words
 Marchete: L2 reg is to avoid overfitting / complex models
 Marchete: and it's via weight-&gt;artificial loss
 Marchete: the car pretty much works without that bolt
 Marchete: at least I was honest
 Westicles: weight loss and occasional irregularity... oh dear
 inoryy: Marchete again I don't mean to criticize you, it just seemed funny you've figured out all the really complex stuff but then threw out the "extra bolt"&#160;:)
 Marchete: not considering the current bias due to submit spams, my current bot was 2nd in oware (much much lower than Robo's bot)
 Marchete: yeah, I know my turorial is funny from a ML point of view
 MSmits: it's hard to go by rating because of determinism
 martinpapa69: you were even first Marchete for few minutes
 Marchete: yay! \o/
 martinpapa69: BiG
 nulte: oware getting dangerous
 Marchete: I have 0% winrate vs Robo
 inoryy: is oware the most popular for NNs?
 Marchete: so I can't deserve that
 Marchete: is the simpler one
 nulte: I think so inory
 Marchete: but the simulation, damn..
 Marchete: so many endgame issues
 nulte: on connect 4 there are 2 NNs, on breakthrough there are 3 I think
 Marchete: I think it's because it's hard to get an heuristic in oware
 inoryy: what about UTTT, any NNs there?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: 3 of them i think
 inoryy: oh recurse did one I think
 MSmits: also robo and jace k
 nulte: on othello there are 3 I think
 nulte: on yavalath 1 that I know
 MSmits: robo
 Marchete: recurs_e won last challenge, by a big margin, with a NN
 inoryy: yeah, I remember that
 inoryy: it's very impressive progress as a whole
 inoryy: When the pandemic clears up and hiring picks up the pace I'd be happy to give a reference to anyone who independently reaches the top of a multi with a NN if they're interested to work in AI for a living. My reference doesn't really mean much but eh you never know until you try.
 <b>**Marchete screenshots oware leaderboard</b></p><p><img src="/a/40823886320345" /> inoryy: by top I mean top~10 or so, you're definitely in the group&#160;:)
 Marchete: I'm 1st until Robo resubmits
 Marchete: so I'll capture the moment
 inoryy: ah, congrats!
 nulte: grats
 Marchete: just rock, paper, scissors
 martinpapa69: I think my (copy of your) bot is forever 9th. I keep removing the stuff i dont like and getting almost exactly the same result. I think the net size is a bigget limiting factor here
 nulte: I also have rank 1  screenshot before robo improved his NN
 nulte: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/8KSJOiB.png">https://i.imgur.com/8KSJOiB.png</a>
 Marchete: what net size?
 Marchete: I used a bit bigger
 Marchete: I have 96,48
 Marchete: maybe it's something else
 martinpapa69: ahh that was the question, didnt understand 
 martinpapa69: so i could fit only 80, 32....
 Marchete: Dense(96), Dense(48)-&gt;policy/value
 martinpapa69: ye and i have 2 more layers in the common part of the netwrok
 Marchete: you can always use the float32to16
 martinpapa69: maybe i could remove them
 Marchete: I've put functions elsewhere
 nulte: you need to make your bot play worse to beat robo
 martinpapa69: ye float16 conversion is a good idea, gonna try it
 Marchete: minimal loss
 Marchete: if size it's the problem
 Marchete: my problem now is more about performance
 Marchete: or amount data to fit in the model
 martinpapa69: tensorflow even has byte conversion, with minimal precision loss
 martinpapa69: havent tried it tho, only read about it
 Marchete: quantization too
 Marchete: robo uses it
 Marchete: I'm still dumb for that
 martinpapa69: one thing is interesting for me that, with training only selfplays, the network never overfits
 martinpapa69: It reaches its final performance in like an hour, and it stays there, even if i train it for one more day
 kovi: not deep enough for overfit?
 Marchete: try with more neurons csip
 Marchete: I think it's noticeable
 martinpapa69: ye i think that will be my next mission
 martinpapa69: to fit bigger network in
 nulte: only 1 hour to train?
 martinpapa69: il lstart with adding #ifdefs to the code
 martinpapa69: to only compile necessary parts for inference
 martinpapa69: ye i changed the pipeline a lot
 martinpapa69: nulte
 Marchete: add the option to convert from and to float16
 Marchete: make a bit bigger the NN model
 Marchete: preference on the first layer
 Marchete: as it's "cheaper"
 Marchete: due to one hots
 martinpapa69: ye, and thats the biggest "bottleneck" in the net
 martinpapa69: from 372-&gt; 96
 martinpapa69: biggest data loss
 martinpapa69: I usually dont make bigger steps, than halving the output in one layer
 martinpapa69: but here, we have to
 Marchete: I don't know
 Marchete: data loss is not from 372-&gt;96
 Marchete: but from the amount of data to predict
 Marchete: 372 are in theory 14 inputs
 martinpapa69: my idea is that you compress you data from 372-&gt;x in a layer
 martinpapa69: umm actually
 martinpapa69: because its encoded in one hot, the first layer cointains much less information, than the 2nd
 martinpapa69: in cumputer vision i always used the halving the layers in thumb rule, but maybe it's not so good here
 Michael1998: hello to all&#160;!
 martinpapa69: float16 header for c++: 200 kb. bruhh
 RoboStac: float16 header?
 martinpapa69: ye. im i overcomplicating something&#160;?
 martinpapa69: am*
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">http://half.sourceforge.net/</a> btw
 RoboStac: yeah
 RoboStac: just do _cvtss_sh to convert them to 16, store them and then convert them back to 32 bit on cg servers using _cvtsh_ss
 RoboStac: don't do any maths with the 16bit versions
 martinpapa69: aa sure, tx for the suggestion. i wanted to do the conversion in the binary, but ye its unnecessary
 RoboStac: If you are writing your weights from python you can do it in numpy too
 nulte: so you train with 32 float and then convert the weights right?
 martinpapa69: ye in numpy, its simple
 nulte: or do you train with 16?
 RoboStac: training is 32 bit
 nulte: makes sense
 Marchete: martinpapa69 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L2663-L2723">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L2663-L2723</a>
 jacek: maybe instead of bigger net, try bigger replay buffer
 Marchete: also that
 martinpapa69: bruh
 martinpapa69: ye thats a good idea jacek, gonna try
 Marchete: check these files functions
 jacek: for bigger net then theres too little data
 Marchete: I sometimes had some problems with the filesize detection
 jacek: and afaik cgzero has low defaults
 Marchete: how low?
 jacek: you said 800k for buffer? or something
 jacek: while i use 12m
 Marchete: 12M?
 Marchete: then yes :D
 martinpapa69: okay, 96-&gt;64 net: 70kb cool.
 Marchete: float32 to 16 isn't that hard, no?
 martinpapa69: ye i thought it was gonna be pain in the arse
 Marchete: I even found that AVX function
 Marchete: that does it nicely
 martinpapa69: btw, why is that, the caching is turned off by default&#160;?
 jacek: win to 12 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/570679151">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/570679151</a> :tada:
 RoboStac: stop bullying my bot, it did nothing to deserve that&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: You did.
 jacek: son carries on father's sins
 BlaiseEbuth: Carry on my wayward son...
 martinpapa69: okay so i kept sending my "best.txt" instead of the "actual.txt" to cg, thats why my result didnt change in the past 2 days XD wp
 Marchete: ohmy
 Marchete: for real?
 Marchete: note to self, clean up folders
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: if you have checkpoints you can try to get the best model
 Marchete: at some point
 martinpapa69: I dont. and i just moved to float16 and changed the model, so my old model is gone anyways
 jacek: so low
 Marchete: do you have samples?
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: anyways
 Marchete: if it only takes 1 hour
 martinpapa69: ye I'll se. I made like 10+ changes in the past two days, so probably something is broken atm
 Marchete: maybe do some tests at some point, pitplays are good for initial tests
 Marchete: something &lt;99% vs random is not good
 jacek: after 3 days
 BugKiller_328: hi
 BugKiller_328: I have class A and B in a single cpp file.
 BugKiller_328: A uses B and B uses A
 BugKiller_328: so I did like
 BugKiller_328: class A;class B;
 BugKiller_328: at the top
 BugKiller_328: but I'm getting error like 'invalid use of incomplete type class 'B'
 mrfoo: use them as pointers
 BugKiller_328: using as pointer
 darkhorse64: you have a circular definition. Change your design
 Astrobytes: im too slow&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrosnail
 MSmits: I prefer kinetically handicapped
 darkhorse64: make more mistakes to recognize them fast enough
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 MSmits: jeez look at this submit: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits</a>
 Astrobytes: nah, not that I didn't see it, my hands didn't move fast enough
 MSmits: mikla too strong&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: clear second
 Astrobytes: aw shush, you're second by a long chalk
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I made my bot around 400x faster
 MSmits: for solving nim
 Astrobytes: oof
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: but need another 400x i think :P
 ANONYMOUS42: why is the winrate 0%
 MSmits: my winrate vs nr 1 is 0%
 MSmits: my winrate against everyone else is 100%
 ANONYMOUS42: oh i see
 jacek: there is 95%
 MSmits: yeah royale
 Astrobytes: with cheese
 MSmits: he rarely beats mikla too
 MSmits: for some reason
 MSmits: well... i found the one win vs mikla anyways
 jxsxtx03: is c++ better than c?
 MSmits: has more options
 MSmits: same speed i suppose
 MSmits: I guess you could say it's better
 ANONYMOUS42: C is for masochists
 jxsxtx03: should i learn c++ in order to do this kind of things?
 jxsxtx03: i know C quite well
 MSmits: depends
 Astrobytes: C has its place
 jxsxtx03: but doing this tasks with C is kinda hard
 Astrobytes: Plenty people use C on here
 ANONYMOUS42: i'm guessing it comes from french schools teaching C mainly
 MSmits: if you want to do complex bot games with 1k line bots and have an easy time writing a sim and still have good performance I would say c++ over c
 Astrobytes: If you find it easier then use C++, use the features you like and write the rest in C
 MSmits: 1k line code
 Astrobytes: tell that to trictrac!
 jxsxtx03: ok ty!
 MSmits: yeah you can start writing a bot in c and if you miss features, just copy it over to c++
 jxsxtx03: c++ has sth to do with c?
 jxsxtx03: or are completely different
 MSmits: c++ is an expansion of c
 MSmits: it's a superset of c mostly
 Astrobytes: You can write C code in C++ no worries.
 jxsxtx03: ahhh
 jxsxtx03: okk
 jxsxtx03: well
 jxsxtx03: im trying to learn c++, ty guys
 MSmits: good luck
 darkhorse64: the first C++ compilers were actually translating C++ to C and compiling the result
 Astrobytes: Interesting. Didn't know that one
 jacek: how 1st compiler was compiled
 MSmits: it was done by a chicken
 Astrobytes: In some kind of assembler language iirc
 darkhorse64: Which is to say anything you write in C++ can be done in C but with great effort
 MSmits: does c have structs?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: then i guess i can mostly translate my bots to c without too much effort
 RoboStac: they're just data containers though, you can't have functions 
 Astrobytes: Please do.
 RoboStac: so you end up with lots of functions that take that struct as the first parameter
 Astrobytes: What robo said :D
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I guess it's just another layer of headache that I already feel using c++&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Pick the tool for the job. If you have a bunch of stuff already implemented in C and it's good, use it. Otherwise, C++ probably has stuff you could use.Some hardware you can't use C++,  etc etc
 Westicles: I read other people's C++ and I can't follow it.  All this auto business
 MSmits: me neither
 Astrobytes: Would you rather a huge line of iterator-based nonsense?
 MSmits: and not just auto, C++ has tons of stuff i never use and would not recognize
 Astrobytes: Like what?
 Westicles: classes and templates and lambdas
 Marchete: and templated classes :D
 MSmits: that sort of thing. It's hard for me to even name examples because when people share their code I often don't know what I am looking at&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: classes are not hard to get your head around, nor templates (until you start getting *into* template metaprogramming I guess)  and who doesn't love a lambda?!
 BlaiseEbuth: classes? You're just doing C in a C++ environment...
 Westicles: yeah, I just use the containers 
 MSmits: same
 BlaiseEbuth: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: I mean i can use a class i suppose, but i dont do much with it
 Marchete: O_O
 MSmits: in c++ that is
 MSmits: in C# I used more features
 MSmits: virtual and abstract stuff
 Astrobytes: Yeah, CG isn't really the place to use that stuff generally though
 MSmits: it is nice sometimes for those complex contest games
 MSmits: like kutulu
 Astrobytes: Or what I mean is, you can get away without it
 BugKiller_328: C is way more faster than c++ even for same code&#160;?
 MSmits: no
 Astrobytes: It's as easy to do that in C++ as it is in C# though MSmits
 MSmits: sure, i just never have
 Astrobytes: Try it, learn the features
 ubap: good evening friends
 MSmits: and it's not exactly as easy, you got the forward declaration
 Astrobytes: good evening ubap
 MSmits: C# doesnt care where you put stuff
 Marchete: that's true
 Astrobytes: Plan and organise better :P
 Marchete: C++ is a pita
 Marchete: with all .h and double definitions
 BlaiseEbuth: -&gt; shit is shit everywhere...
 MSmits: I try to put things in the right order so i dont have to forward declare, but sometimes you have stuff referencing eachother and then you have no choice
 Astrobytes: It is, I admit. But it comes down to design and planning ateotd
 Marchete: it's not about design, it's cumbersome
 Marchete: for todays' standards
 MSmits: old languages have to try too hard to be backward compatible
 MSmits: like the weird typing c++ has
 MSmits: long long =&#160;?
 MSmits: I doubt rust has this problem
 Marchete: unsigned long long but not that long you undestand me 
 ubap: long long = at least 64bit&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: uint64_t [solved]
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: thats what i do yeah
 Astrobytes: Specify what you need
 Astrobytes: And don't assume a damn thing
 Astrobytes: You have to be explicit or C++ will piss in your chips
 MSmits: eww
 Astrobytes: Especially going between different platforms/test environments
 Astrobytes: Be specific as to what you want and need, make sure you test whether you're getting what you want or need
 BugKiller_328: dummy question to create object array in c++
 BugKiller_328: Dog *data = new Dog[5];
 BugKiller_328: this will generate 5 object of Dog
 BugKiller_328: what I want to know is Is there a way to call constructor which has parameter during making array with dynamically using 'new' keyword&#160;?
 nulte: new Dog[5]{ {1}, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4 }, { 5 } };
 BugKiller_328: for example&#160;?Dog::Dog(string name, int age);
 nulte: new Dog[2] { {"a", 9}, {"b",10} };
 BugKiller_328: If I want to pass same parameter for all objects though
 MSmits: Or just do it like the CG Pros: Dog dogs[1000000]
 BugKiller_328: Is it ok? MSmits&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: creating fixed size of array&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: just keep a count of how much of it you're using
 MSmits: and make sure the size is enough
 MSmits: I often have 20 million nodes for a tree or something
 MSmits: most i will not be using
 BugKiller_328: yeah, of course I need to have like num_of_dogs ..
 MSmits: if they're that big, they have to be global though 
 MSmits: or at least forced to be on heap somehow
 BugKiller_328: now trying to do mcts but when I make expansion, it will have different child..
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: it's for CG?
 Marchete: then forget new
 MSmits: what i do is i give a Node 2 things:  a childindex and a childcount
 BugKiller_328: so I was going to make array in dynamic size
 MSmits: childindex tells you where in the massive array the set of children starts
 MSmits: and childcount tells you where it ends
 nulte: BugKiller_328 you dont want to initialize memory during search
 BugKiller_328: and then loop by child++&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah for example 
 nulte: You must create a pool of objects on first turn
 BugKiller_328: ok ..
 MSmits: just loop on the part of the array you need
 BugKiller_328: and creating object with new keyword (probably will be generated on heap) is not good in CG bot programming&#160;?

 Marchete: I do use new

 Marchete: for tree reuse purposes
 Marchete: imo maybe not worth it
 Marchete: it's slow
 Marchete: Smits is hardcore, he doesn't even save the parent pointer
 Marchete: I prefer to do it
 MSmits: BugKiller_328 this is an example of a loop

 BugKiller_328: MSmits  it's not even pointer&#160;??
 BugKiller_328: :D
 MSmits: what is?
 BugKiller_328: int childIndex;
 MSmits: yeah thats just an integer
 MSmits: Node* children = nodes + temp-&gt;childIndex;
 MSmits: nodes is the object pool
 MSmits: i add the childindex and that gives me the start of my set of children
 BugKiller_328: makes sense..
 MSmits: it's like a subarray
 BugKiller_328: yeah, totally understand
 BugKiller_328: childIndex // where my child starts in pool
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It's pretty useful
 BugKiller_328: my purpose was to learn algo enough.. but I realized that I'm even weak in data structure than algo.. :D
 BugKiller_328: struggling how to manage data ...
 Marchete: ..manage data in CG constraints
 Marchete: just make a difference vs other environments
 Marchete: outside CG I would never make that big static array
 nulte: Check memory pool
 nulte: is the same concept
 MSmits: it's pretty much the only data you store BugKiller_328 in mcts that is
 BugKiller_328: you're making big static array for only speed thing..
 nulte: ofc
 MSmits: depending on how you store the gamestate, it's either on the node, or it's modified when applying moves and reset when the rollout is done
 BugKiller_328: like to make more simulation within limited time&#160;?
 nulte: I dont use a brain i use speed
 Marchete: optimize to win
 nulte: yes
 MSmits: yes BugKiller_328, but also it's simple
 MSmits: no need to worry about running out of memory except for managing the object pool. there is no other memory use
 MSmits: unless you count the small stacks that come and go
 BugKiller_328: Thanks ..
 MSmits: good luck, ask any time. This sort of thing is discussed a lot here
 MSmits: when people are not talking about neural networks that is
 MSmits: or doing cat emotes
 BugKiller_328: thanks MSmits.
 MSmits: np
 Astrobytes: EPT working nulte?
 nulte: I think my eval might be bad
 nulte: I just threw random stuff
 nulte: But my bot plays different now
 Astrobytes: nulte: I beat Crazy_Remi so I'm done for tonight in BT, do your worst!
 nulte: grats
 Astrobytes: It's a damn tough top 20
 nulte: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/570701005">https://www.codingame.com/replay/570701005</a>
 nulte: what is my bot doing
 Astrobytes: Sign error?
 Astrobytes: It looks like it wants to have less pieces than the opponent
 nulte: maybe
 Astrobytes: Output the values of your eval and look for strange things
 Astrobytes: *values of the features in your eval
 linjoehan: I finally learned some python now I can play golf
 nulte: I think ill create local referee or something
 nulte: just to test faster
 Astrobytes: It's on my list.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, out for tonight. Take care dude, and everyone else too
 nulte: gn
 FalINTOblivion0112: im a rusty programmer
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh no not the tech lead again
 FalINTOblivion0112: imma lose
 Menium: i am a noob programer
 Zenoscave: Meta-mcts question here
 Zenoscave: opening book keeps using same replies and I can't seem to change that even by changing exploration constant
 Zenoscave: Any ideas?
 Westicles: nobody here but us clashers

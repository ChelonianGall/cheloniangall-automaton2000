 leocrabe225: Hey guys, in Ghost in the Cell, can we know if a factory has been hit by a bomb&#160;?
 FuriousT: is it possible to dump molecules in Code4Life?
 tinManB: Hellow!
 leocrabe225: Hello
 tinManB: can you please explain the chuck Norris technique?
 leocrabe225: You need to struggle the guy from his back, you must compress his blood vessel, doing so he will pass out
 eulerscheZahl: FuriousT no it's not possible
 tinManB: lol. I was talking about the challenge
 leocrabe225: I don't know about any challenge lmao
 tinManB: ok then
 AndrewAung11: Who can explain me about Skynet Revolution - Episode 1?
 AndrewAung11: Can anyone explain me about Skynet Revolution - Episode 1?
 leocrabe225: OK, I read the subject tinMan
 leocrabe225: I can explain
 leocrabe225: Do yo
 ProgrammerDog: moderate my contribution please
 ProgrammerDog: and by that I mean approve it
 leocrabe225: Let's explain the first example
 BenjaminUrquhart: time to not moderate ProgrammerDog's contrib
 BenjaminUrquhart: AndrewAung11 are you still there?
 tinManB: I googled it and I think I got it now. so 1 is 0 and 0 is 00
 leocrabe225: C = 1000011 in ascii binary, so you wanna separate the 0s from the 1s it give you 1 0000 11. Then if you wanna write a 1 you start with 0 otherwise you start with 00
 leocrabe225: So&#160;: 0 0|00 0000|0 00
 leocrabe225: for 1|0000|11
 tinManB: so the frequency  is displayed by 0's with out spaces 
 tinManB: right?
 leocrabe225: You must output the spaces
 leocrabe225: Or you would just have a lot of 0s
 leocrabe225: And you must not separate the letters
 tinManB: o okay, the number representation 1st 0 or 00 and space then the frequency of appirance 000
 leocrabe225: Like, if a A is 0000000 then AA translated is 00 00000000000000
 tinManB: got it thanks
 leocrabe225: Ok nice, you're welcome&#160;!

 KiwiTae: hey bobs
 struct: hi kiwi
 Matrix007: hey guys...i need help with temperatures
 KiwiTae: jiayou
 Matrix007: i have finshed all other test cases except the simple test case..
 KiwiTae: simple? no temperature?
 Matrix007: no..the first test case
 KiwiTae: bummer~
 KiwiTae: whats the case?
 Matrix007: 51 -2 -8 4 5
 struct: Can you share the code
 struct:&#160;?
 KiwiTae: need to output 1 no?
 Matrix007: thats what i am asking how to share it
 KiwiTae: paste it it will create a pastebin link
 struct: just paste it here
 Matrix007: i am a total noob so my code looks dirty...wait let me see
 KiwiTae: no worry we seen worse
 Matrix007: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/30ae6942-72ec-45ed-8725-d98f55bb1e65">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/30ae6942-72ec-45ed-8725-d98f55bb1e65</a>
 struct: They have seen my code
 Matrix007: great theres it..
 Matrix007: shall i just explain the code?
 Matrix007: i am just sorry guys..
 Matrix007: gotta go..
 struct: Np, Im reading it
 Matrix007: i will come later..
 struct: oh ok
 Matrix007: basic logic is seperate negative and positive...find smallest in both of them..make them both positive...find the smallest one thats the required one
 Matrix007: i am sorry if it was spoiled..
 KiwiTae: dont want to just use abs()&#160;? hehe
 struct: if(small==1)		{			cout&lt;&lt;-smalln;		}
 struct: its not the only problem
 struct: removing this creates other problems
 Nezinau: Hey, can't figure out, why my code fails if first 2 numbers have smallest diff. Could you bring me on a right path?
 Nezinau: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7a61f3a-45a1-4216-92e5-499d761272ff">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7a61f3a-45a1-4216-92e5-499d761272ff</a>
 Earthborne: Nezinau aren't you getting an index error when i==N-1?
 DaNinja: it wont work if two consecutive numbers are negative
 MadKnight: because this is js Nezinau
 MadKnight: that explains everything
 Earthborne: ^^^^ 
 KiwiTae: :grimacing: Maddy
 Nezinau: :D
 MadKnight: i'm not joking, his sort does string sort
 Earthborne: wtf
 Nezinau: No i am not getting any error, just fails in submit phase.
 DaNinja: abs(-8 - -7) is not 1
 DaNinja: o_O
 Nezinau: oh, 
 DaNinja: wait
 Earthborne: wait
 Earthborne: it is though
 <b>**wlesavo waits</b></p><p><img src="/a/35022107863170" /> DaNinja: try abs(all[i+1]) - abs(all[i])
 MadKnight: no i mean [1, 2, 10].sort() -&gt; [1. 10, 2]
 Earthborne: well that's weird
 MadKnight: just check if it's like that
 Nezinau: try abs(all[i+1]) - abs(all[i]) same issue
 jrke: all set for contest :muscle_tone2:
 DaNinja: you need to split() the 2nd line
 MadKnight: DaNinja since when are there negative numbers?
 MadKnight: DaNinja it's not temperatues puzzle also
 Earthborne: what puzzle is this anyway?
 MadKnight: Nezinau don't listen to DaNinja he thinks it's temperatues
 DaNinja: its not temps?
 MadKnight: no it's horses
 DaNinja: duh
 MadKnight: Nezinau your sort goes [1, 2, 10].sort() -&gt; [1. 10, 2]
 KiwiTae: uuh we can't do string("hello")*2 in c++ to output hellohello?
 Earthborne: But why on earth isn't he getting an index error on `for (let i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { all[i+1] .... }`??
 Nezinau: Yeah, its horses
 MadKnight: u can if u overload * KiwiTae
 struct: Earthborne he goes out of bounds at end
 MadKnight: because it's js Earthborne
 MadKnight: js allows u to go out of index
 MadKnight: it just gives 'undefined'
 Earthborne: oh
 MadKnight: Nezinau fix your sort
 Earthborne: I keep far away from js
 Nezinau: MadKnight, ok thx
 Nezinau: It worked, Thanks!!!
 Earthborne: Ouf, gotta do some more exam reading before the contest start, good it wasn't until this afternoon
 AntonCosmin: any hints about the fall challenge?

 MadKnight: why would we want that, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: because it's hard to figure out the best way to be sure to use the boost
 MadKnight: do we just kick him, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: oh and if you want to do that?
 MadKnight: yea that's better
 SeekDog: Hi
 tinManB: Hello
 tinManB: Anybody  who knows chuck Norris' method?
 hem123: sure what do you need
 tinManB: I was able to convert simple chars to it. but special characters and long texts are different
 hem123: python?
 tinManB: yes
 hem123: yes so you need to loop per character
 Uljahn: do you use 7-bit for binary representation with leading zeros?
 hem123: ie: CC= 1000011+1000011
 hem123: and indeed one need to make sure to make them 7 bit
 tinManB: yes I did 
 hem123: for example use .zfill(7)
 hem123: CC= 1000011+1000011 ==&gt;10000111000011
 tinManB: answer = <i>.join(format(ord(i), 'b') for i in message)</i>
 tinManB: for example for&#160;%  i get binary 100101 but the expected result starts with 00
 tinManB: I thought zero was 00 and 1 is 0?
 hem123: 7bits
 Uljahn: you should extend the binary to 7-bit with leading zeros, for example use .zfill(7)
 hem123: 0100101
 Uljahn: :shrug:
 tinManB: answer = <i>.join(format(ord(i), '07b') for i in message)  </i>
 hem123: also if you wnat it short look into printf
 tinManB: look this is what I get even after .zfill(7)
 tinManB: FailureFound: 00 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0Expected: 00 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0
 Uljahn: maybe you have a bug somewhere else
 tinManB: its for&#160;%
 hem123: i cannot look into your code but it seems to be missing the last number
 tinManB: Thanks it was a while loop problem
 Oursbrun: there is a problem with the puzzle "codevs zombies"
 Oursbrun: I hard coded and get all the test pass how can I report that
 Oursbrun: "code vs Zombies"
 wlesavo: thats not a problem, thats a feature
 Uljahn: your score isn't very high, is it? the goal is not just to pass but to get the highest score possible
 Oursbrun: ok, I see
 struct: also the validators are different from test cases
 struct: so hardcoding test cases wont do much
 wlesavo: i think he meant validators
 ImagineLosing: monkey
 Uljahn: patching
 DomiKo: ehhhh I have to do Code of Rings
 DomiKo: I hate that opti&#160;:(
 DomiKo: someone hate that one too?
 ParticleBeam: A relatively basic greedy algorithm seems to work for Code of the Rings
 DomiKo: not really&#160;:/
 ParticleBeam: its not globally optimal no, but a reasonable place to start
 ParticleBeam: Oh. I see you have done the puzzle already. 
 wlesavo: DomiKo you also may cash in some easy cp in cg sponsored, map detection + simple sim = easy top 15 there
 DomiKo: you could be right
 DomiKo: yesterday I finally done A*Craft and CodeVsZombie offline and reach top6 and top15
 logiqub: @DomiKo I love it actually.
 DomiKo: and CodeOfRight and Sposored are the ones I have to do
 DomiKo: tell me
 DomiKo: what is so great in that one?
 struct: in sponsored?
 logiqub: At first I hated it, because I don't really like Brainfuck. But once you get it working a little bit, it becomes fun. Probably easier if you wrote interpreters/compilers before.
 DomiKo: struct in Code Of Rings
 struct: 1:30 hours lets go

 eulerscheZahl: a lvl1 user on the chat, how did that happen?

 Nerchio: hola amigos
 AlPaca: does codingame have an irc chat?
 AlPaca: or matrix channel?

 BenjaminUrquhart: you're banned
 Gabbek: hehe, gotta use spells&#160;:)
 ParticleBeam: I use a random action
 BenjaminUrquhart: sorry to do it to you
 Donotalo: For instance, a client order with delta = -2, -1, 0, 0 means you have to consume 2 tier-0 ingredients and 1 tier-2 ingredients from your inventory in order to brew the potion.
 Donotalo: in the problem statement
 BoBot: lol you lazy guys, I at least sorted them by price
 Donotalo: ... 1 tier-2 ingredients&#160;? OR 1 tier-1 ingredent?
 BenjaminUrquhart: BoBot if it works it works
 BoBot: but did not look if I had the ingredients, that is for later :D
 BoBot: got me to Wood 1
 BenjaminUrquhart: wood 2 is a joke usually so
 BenjaminUrquhart: or whatever the starting league is
 jacek: easy to learn hard to master

 Icebox: that was the best contest ever anyway
 Gabbek: this is so cool :D
 Hjax: im glad you are having fun Gabbek :D
 CommanderCero: god so many rules its like reading a book
 Gabbek: do you have to be #1 to get to bronze, even if you're above the boss in wood league?
 struct: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: I've seen worse
 Hjax: no you just need to be above the boss
 struct: just need to be above the boss at 100%
 CommanderCero: no you just need to be above the boss
 Gabbek: okey, so just need to wait few minutes
 jacek: AutomatonNN what are the rules
 CommanderCero: yeah until the leaderboard says 100% of matches completed
 Gabbek: oh yeah, that worked

 aristotelis-bobas: how do you recognize your own inventory input?
 Immanio: Your own inventory is read first
 aristotelis-bobas: always? in arena sometimes you are the right witch
 Immanio: in the for loop reading iventory, i = 0 is your inventory, i = 1 is the opponent
 aristotelis-bobas: ok ty
 Q12: look at actionType
 CommanderCero:  integers to describe each player, your data is always first: 
 CommanderCero: in the rules
 aristotelis-bobas: you are right, thank you
 aristotelis-bobas: 5 integers to describe each player, your data is always first: 
 aristotelis-bobas: YOUR data is bold
 MadKnight: is it always gonna have this bunch of spells&#160;?
 MadKnight: or it will be different spells?
 aristotelis-bobas: in later leagues you will have learn / tome mechanics
 struct: bronze is final
 aristotelis-bobas: lol
 CommanderCero: seems like it, they have hardcoded spells which are just shuffles
 CommanderCero: here from bronze:You can check out the source code of this game on this GitHub repo. You can find a list of all possible spells in the tome. 
 MadKnight: so how are u guys doing the code for spells&#160;?
 tomatoes: no referee this time?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020</a>
 tomatoes: thanks!
 MadKnight: struct how are u gonna be checking what spells to use&#160;?
 struct: idk, Im still reading rules
 yhyoxx: maybe choose the spell that will let u brez the potion with most rupees
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have ideas
 yhyoxx: brew*
 MadKnight: but what if u can get enough stuff for a potion with -2 rupess in 3 turns less?
 yhyoxx: that was as far as my brain could go goodluck with that&#160;:')
 AntiSquid: hi MadKnight 
 MadKnight: hihi squiddy
 Dan4Life: what happens if u brew a potion but u dont have enough ingredients for that potion?
 Dan4Life: does it automatically wait
 arthurb123: this is so fun
 BenjaminUrquhart: nothing
 MadKnight: nothing
 crgonzal: you should catch those cases, i guess it will do nothing
 Uemu: I print BREW with some ID and it tells me SPELL ID does not exist, lol wth&#160;?
 Washier: foor wood 1 is purely pick the potion with the biggest price
 AntiSquid: oh there's another D user already on the LB
 Dan4Life: how do i check inventory?
 AntiSquid: hi Jeroen.
 Dan4Life: the inventory is showing after the action count loop so i dont know what i initially have
 Washier: you get the actions and the inventory every turn, so you do know what you have before acting
 BryanGriffiths: then store the actions and do all your logic after the input is finished
 Washier: ^^
 yhyoxx: yup
 Dan4Life: oh
 BryanGriffiths: for example I make a brew struc, a spell struc, a player struc, etc. then parse all the input into the relevent arrays of structs
 Dan4Life: i understand
 BryanGriffiths: then do what ever logic I want. This way I can adapt as the tiers get more complex
 BryanGriffiths: :thumbsup:
 DeCe: every spell can only be used once?
 Hjax: @DeCe if you REST you can refresh your reusuable spells 
 DeCe: thanks&#160;:) missed that part
 Washier: hi Hjax
 Hjax: hi there&#160;:)
 Gabbek: there are some repeatable spells in bronze
 Washier: Hjax, any early thoughts you have on how to approach(optimize?) this puppy?
 Hjax: im thinking i might want to read some code4life postmortems 
 Hjax: since this game is pretty similar looking
 Washier: cool tx
 Washier: its a perfect info game, think gametrees useful?
 AntiSquid: recurze said it's similar to code a la mode too, not sure :thinking: i see some similarities indeed
 Gabbek: mix of code a la mode &amp; code4life I think
 Hjax: yeah it looks searchable, but in higher leagues the ability to learn more complex spells will make the branching factor blow up a bit more 
 AntiSquid: regression trees washier
 Washier: tx, will look into it
 Gabbek: looks like I'll have a really rough time, but I'll try anyway :D
 Astrobytes: I don't like it much, though I've not tried properly yet
 AntiSquid: haha was joking, not sure you have time to do that during contest, applause if you do Washier
 Washier: haha. i'm taking some time off from work for this. so much moarr interesting
 Hjax: i wont be able to start my bot until this evening 
 AntiSquid: then maybe you do have time!
 AntiSquid: it's evening in UK
 Washier: is the game engine open?
 AntiSquid: check your time zone privilege&#160;!
 Washier: haven't checked
 Astrobytes: Washier:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020</a>
 Washier: sweeet
 Washier: tx

 Cohmedy: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 <b>**Cohmedy slaps Astrobytes around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/39803283840838" /> BloodyTurtles: lol, everybody in the challenge wood league 1 has the same code
 BenjaminUrquhart: Automaton2000 do thing
 Automaton2000: the problem is that if you make a move in the same league
 BloodyTurtles: I haven't lost a single time but they are all ties
 Barimehdi77: how can I make a spell in the wood 1 league?
 BloodyTurtles: CAST id
 Gabbek: make sure you fulfill the requirements and then output command: CAST {action_id}
 Gabbek: (you probably want to create a list of spells so that you can track them)
 Barimehdi77: but how can I turn the tier-0 ingredient to tier-1?
 Barimehdi77: so I can complete the spell ingredients 
 LastRick: The comment for tomeIndex says "Always 0" in the first two leagues. Yet, I'm reading it and it says -1?
 LastRick: Same with taxCOunt
 cegprakash: any C++ streamers?
 Barimehdi77: but how can I turn the tier-0 ingredient to tier-1?so I can complete the spell ingredients 
 SabertheLost: I feel bad for the wood 1 boss
 DeCe: Will there be new rules for Silver league?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 BloodyTurtles: probably, there is that tax thing
 BenjaminUrquhart: final rules are in bronze
 BloodyTurtles: oh ok
 DeCe: Thanks&#160;:) 
 Barimehdi77: can any one help me
 Barimehdi77: plz
 Barimehdi77: how can I turn the tier-0 ingredient to tier-1?so I can complete the spell ingredients 
 LastRick: i'm only guessing here but what if that's something you cant do in the first league?
 Gabbek: Barimehdi77 you have to cast a spell which creates tier-1 ingredient, but to do that you have to have certain ingredients required by the said spell
 LastRick: I'm guessing that is a CAST option 
 LastRick: yeah, what Gabbek said
 Gabbek: available spells are provided for you in input section, their action_id is "CAST"
 Dan4Life: what happens if u and ur opponent both get the same points?
 Hjax: you both win
 Dan4Life: oh
 Hjax: (you tie)
 Hjax: but it will display on the results as both of you getting #1
 Jayantpro: Man even league 2 seems har
 Jayantpro: hard*
 Dan4Life: lol, just greedily picking the highest price that u can brew is enough, i hvnt lost a single game yet, but then its wood 2...
 BloodyTurtles: it gets a bit more complicated in wood1
 BloodyTurtles: but no need for any fancy algorithm
 BloodyTurtles: greedy works just fine
 BloodyTurtles: ooh, I am about the beat the boss like after 10 min in wood 1
 Dan4Life: nice
 AntiSquid: wood1 here
 sahilrox: In case of a tie, what is the tie-breaker?
 BloodyTurtles: ok, I'm just 1 position under the boss
 Jayantpro: Sorry i meant wood1 only lol
 BloodyTurtles: oh, i'm 3rd now after the boss
 AntiSquid: what's a quick way to bronze from wood1? don't want to overengineer
 Nerchio: asd
 Uljahn: random choice for bronze
 AntiSquid: what?
 BloodyTurtles: here's a greedy algorithm
 BloodyTurtles:&#160;:
 Nerchio: my chat lagged sry :P
 AntiSquid: kick + ban @_@
 BloodyTurtles: if you can cast a spell, cast the highest price one
 BloodyTurtles: srry, meant brew a potion
 BloodyTurtles: else if you can cast a spell, cast the first one
 Nerchio: you need to start casting spells in wood1 so its not so easy i guess
 Nerchio: thats only enough to pass wood2 though
 BloodyTurtles: else if not all castable, REST
 BloodyTurtles: else WAIT
 AntiSquid: damn it
 BloodyTurtles: yes, i'm in bronze
 BloodyTurtles: ok, it's getting a bit more complicated now in bronze
 Dan4Life: :clap:
 AntiSquid: i go watch a stream for quick bronze @_@
 ProgrammerDog: &amp;_&amp;
 Avenslova: Hey everyone
 Avenslova: Whar does the actionId refer to exactly in the order?
 VaseSimion: wood 2 is really simple to pass and in wood one you just need to figure out how the logic of the spells advantages you
 Xenoid: The actionId is what you enter in your output to tell the game what to brew, cast, or learn
 Avenslova: Oh, thank you
 AbsorbantLight: There's no learning in wood-1, right?
 Xenoid: correct
 Hjax: correct no tome until bronze
 MarcinS: qwertyiiuyteertyuioiuytrtyuiol;lkfnbij9iujnfdvjufirjn fdvnj
 Icebox: I agree with him
 Waffle3z: I was just about to say that
 AntonCosmin: Hey guys, anyone knows how to write debug in C#?
 ScifiSpirit: To debug: Console.Error.WriteLine("Debug messages...");
 AntonCosmin: yes, it works! thank you 
 ScifiSpirit: Np
 lNitsua: I haven't played since Ocean of code, but the IDE seems much smoother now, or is it just me?
 Waffle3z: "The game ends once at least one witch has brewed 3 potions." looks like it's still giong on for 100 rounds?
 tutubalin: typo in contest description:"However, the witch's hut in witch..."
 ProgrammerDog: What is capital C in binary?
 tutubalin: ProgrammerDog 64+3
 Xenoid: 67 = 0x1000011
 Waffle3z: oh they're all spells not brews
 Xenoid: err just 1000011 rather, not hex
 Waffle3z: 0b1000011
 Xenoid: yeah that ^
 Xenoid: thanks
 linjoehan: can the editor stop trying to be smart?
 crgonzal: why if "inv" mean the ammount of gems on inventory it run a for loop twice&#160;?
 Laws: your inv and their inv
 Xenoid: You also receive information about your opponent's inventory
 GiraffeKing: first is you, second is opponent
 crgonzal: omg i so dumb LOL
 BenjaminUrquhart: k I finally have a basic bot done
 BenjaminUrquhart: gonna wait for bronze promotion before I do anything else 
 Hjax: are all the rules available in bronze
 Hjax: or will something change in silver (more spells?)
 tomatoes:  All the rules are now unlocked! 
 Over9000: Learn new spells from the magic tome
 struct: bronze should be final Hjax
 Over9000: Oh wait sorry I'm dumb
 Hjax: ok nice
 Gabbek: Hjax wanna talk a bit? Guess we can share some ideas&#160;:)
 Hjax: sure, i cant do anything but brainstorm until i get home anyway 
 Gabbek: sent you a message on discord
 Hjax: ah i can use discord where i am right now, just message me here
 Gabbek: hopefully the anime girl named Hjax is you :P
 Gabbek: okey, sure
 Hjax: hey thats Yuko from The Demon Girl Next Door 
 linjoehan: Whoop no loses for me so far. (Wood 2)
 BenjaminUrquhart: yay timeouts my favorite
 Biaggio: yo
 Jayantpro: Man even going after wood1 is hard
 Biaggio: what's the lowest league
 BenjaminUrquhart: wood 2 for this contest
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh boy this tome is gonna be a pain
 Nerchio: :innocent:
 Avenslova: how do you guys read actionId's?
 Avenslova: Sorry for a dumb question
 tomatoes: they're in input. bootstrap code handle it
 BenjaminUrquhart: with our eyes
 Nerchio: the input for each turn gives you actionId?
 Quidome: you can het into wood1 with random play&#160;:)
 crgonzal: "the unique ID of this spell or recipe"The id of the spell or the potion
 Nerchio: i feel like urgency bonus should be given somewhere not sure why we are supposed to calculate it ourselves :D
 Avenslova: wait, maybe I messed something else up in my loop
 Quidome: what are the bronze rules?
 tomatoes: that's complicated
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/DiibMep.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/DiibMep.jpg</a>
 Quidome: thnxs
 lNitsua: sometimes I just don't understand programming. LIterally just copied my code over to another doc, refereshed this ones IDE, and then copied it over step by step, and now all of a sudden my code works
 lNitsua: I don't think I changed anything
 hem123: is there an easy way to know which potions have been made and are gone?
 GiraffeKing: They won't be in the action list anymore, for one
 BenjaminUrquhart: they don't appear in the input
 hem123: thanks made a mistake
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499656178">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499656178</a> why does the boss get 28 and me 27&#160;? i see 23 and 20 throughout the game
 tomatoes: unused ingredients
 tomatoes: Players gain 1 rupee for each tier-1 ingredient or higher in their inventory.
 Icebox: guys
 Icebox: the spells dissapear after 3 turns of being exhauster?
 Icebox: exhausted*
 Icebox: and if yes, why don't the rules mention it
 Icebox: or does it dissapear only visually
 [CG]Thibaud: only visually
 Icebox: ah
 Icebox: thank you
 [CG]Thibaud: if you learn many spells
 lxnn: Hey :slight_smile: Do the rules change at all after Bronze?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 AntiSquid: yes, harder opponents
 lxnn: Thanks
 Icebox: Rule change: opponents are now hard
 Icebox: kappa
 BenjaminUrquhart: how could I forget
 BenjaminUrquhart: stupid me
 Avenslova: I return the command to brew and the game tells that I don't wth
 DomiKo: why we have to calculate urgency&#160;:(
 [Csongor]: lol my code used the enemy inventory as mine until now.
 AntiSquid: trying to promote the lazy way failed . putting too much work into this&#160;:/
 jacek: are here any other way?
 njaber: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d1e4f8a-457c-404b-98bb-2d971fc8a169">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d1e4f8a-457c-404b-98bb-2d971fc8a169</a>
 njaber: Should have made a s shorter message
 njaber: TL;DR, I find this challenge quite underwhelming
 AntiSquid: or break it into paragraphs
 njaber: Yeah
 Rxspect: how do you change the height of mountain 0 on the descent Im new
 Rxspect: also Im on java
 Doju: njaber i agree
 Gabbek: AntiSquid you want to reach bronze?
 Doju: I was dissapointed because don't have the time to build a good bot for this challenge
 Doju: But now i think i might not even try to build one at all
 Hjax: this game looks way more fun than pacman to me 
 Hjax: i hated how random pacman felt 
 jacek: njaber i think it will be better to watch when the bots will be better. now is somewhat random fest
 Gabbek: AntiSquid I suggest you try to go after cheapest/most expensive brew and make sure to use spells, that should do it
 AntiSquid: 31.45 vs bots 32.03 can just wait lol
 njaber: I feel like even with better bots, the replay is just unreadable, you need to think for a long time on each frame to try to understand why a choic would be better or hy a bot made agiven choice
 AntiSquid: boss *
 Nerchio: is there a spell limi?
 Nerchio: limit? i guess not
 Gabbek: there isn't
 njaber: 46, the 4 base spells + the 42 in the tome
 AntiSquid: i don't think it's an easier challenge. you still have to make the best bot
 AntiSquid: well easier to get start if you even bother tracking the game state
 AntiSquid: want bronze before i think of my bot structure lol kinda annoyed :P
 jacek: i got to bronze making random actions
 AntiSquid: but you need to verify them no?
 Hjax: lol really? how do you define random actions 
 tomatoes: like my life
 Hjax: like squid said, you at least need to check that its something valid 
 AntiSquid: exactly, just random can be a mess
 jacek: well they give you actions. other than ignoring OPPONENT_CAST, there is no filtering
 jacek: i did in in first 30 minutes of challenge, could be because of others pushing me up
 njaber: I don't think it's easier either, actually I think the it probably is more challenging on a technical standpoint, but it feels way more straightforward then pacman, I feel like in this one everyone will have a somwhat similar bots, and the small optimizations will make the big difference, whereas in pacman there was a lot of interesting approaches one could take 
 AntiSquid: i only look at brew and cast
 Hjax: so you just randomly brew or cast something?
 Hjax: with no regard for your inventory 
 AntiSquid: not me . i select valid brew / cast
 Hjax: dont you just try invalid brews every turn?
 jacek: so far, yes
 jacek: thast why im 280 / 301 in bronze
 Hjax: im kind of surprised that got bronze 
 jacek: i got bronze when there were only 4 people there
 AntiSquid: early on you are more likely to get pushed
 struct: yeah
 Gabbek: uhh, #9 - bot losing most games by being stuck on 10 items :D
 struct: I got pushed
 AntiSquid: 0.40 :o
 struct: I was 2nd on wood 1
 Nerchio: im wondering if at the absolute optimization this game won't be very drawish
 njaber: I just put together a bot that weighs actions with a manually tweaked algorithm that evaluates ingredient value, brew value, etc. and I got 80 bronze
 struct: and then was pushed to bronze
 BenjaminUrquhart: njaber I did none that that and got the same place basically lmao
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have no scoring just a blind search
 Gabbek: I would love to hear some basic tip regarding contest - I should be checking out replays if I want to fix the most prevelant issue, right? (Not aiming for anything crazy, just trying to adapt for the time being)
 njaber: I don't even search
 BenjaminUrquhart: I search because I'm used to contests with pathfinding
 njaber: I just count number of items in inventory &gt; evaluate value of items depending on existing brews,casts and number of items &gt; get value of each action &gt; take action with highest gain
 njaber: I can't even integrate spell learning with this
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh that reminds me I need to do full inventory checks
 Gabbek: make sure you implement even the most basic inventory size check
 Gabbek: since that's very easy to get stuck
 njaber: yeah having a bot that doesn't soft-lock is enough to get out of wood 1 I feel like
 Hjax: lol, i submitted random bot and it promoted, thats hilarious 
 Hjax: im bronze now 
 Gabbek: haha, grats Hjax
 AntiSquid: oof
 Gabbek: that's actually quite an achievement :D
 AntiSquid: what rand did you use?
 jacek: return 4;
 AntiSquid: did you test valid actions?
 Hjax: its literally, rest if you have any unavail spells, then 50% chance between choose random brew and choose random spell 
 Hjax: testing no validities or anything 
 Hjax: i cant believe that promotes
 jacek: hjaxmax
 AntiSquid: i just need my +0.3
 jacek: hmax
 Hjax: i hadnt tried random because i didnt think it would work, thanks for convincing me jacek
 njaber: if you add a random chance to the rest and add a learn, you could just submit that and have a chance you bot plays perfectly untill the end of the tournament&#160;:')
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499685295">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499685295</a>
 AntiSquid: ok i can promote now probably, only was picking last valid spell, now collecting all valid ones and picking rand
 Gabbek: a useful reminder for score: make sure to count inventory as points!
 Gabbek: otherwise this can happen :D
 Hjax: my bot rests after every spell cast, for even chance of using each spell 
 Hjax: otherwise you will cast every spell, and slowly fill your inventory with t4 
 AntiSquid: i only rest if len(spells) == 0
 Hjax: which isnt great
 Hjax: yeah that will just fill inventory with t4
 Hjax: and make you get stuck 
 MadKnight: ezpz top-25 bronze
 Hjax: i did rest if len(spells) &lt; 4 
 Waffle3z: I rest if the spell I want isn't castable
 njaber: just do 50% chance if len &lt; 4
 Hjax: we arent doing intelligent things here Waffle3z
 Hjax: we are making random bots 
 AntiSquid: it's ok i am already above boss with this mess
 AntiSquid: mine isn't really rand collects valid actions :P
 Gabbek: do you guys see where it's mentioned about inventory ingrements counting towards score at the end? Can't find it&#160;:(
 tomatoes: &lt;4 will stuck at the start
 AlexisMolestos: any way to use my IDE (pycharm) instead of this?
 Gabbek: oh, found it: Players gain 1 rupee for each tier-1 ingredient or higher in their inventory.
 Hjax: it was good enough to get bronze tomatoes
 Hjax: which is all i was trying to do
 Hjax: i added like 5 lines of code to the python 3 starter and got bronze 
 Hjax: missions accomplished 
 AntiSquid: brawnze now
 jacek: starter?
 tomatoes: only 2 spells castable at the start :thinking:
 Hjax: the default code
 Hjax: whatever you want to call it 
 jacek: oh
 Beresta: bronze is at full rules right?
 yhyoxx: very motivating, ive tryin to write an algo for hours now ;_;
 AntiSquid: cast times&#160;? this really complicates things
 njaber: yhyoxx just make sure your bot doesn't soft lock and you should be able to get into bronze
 yhyoxx: what's softlock&#160;?
 Hjax: fill its inventory with junk and get stuck 
 njaber: Taking no action/invalid action each turn 
 AntiSquid: yhyoxx get valid moves and pick a random one
 njaber: If your bot always takes a valid action it should be ok
 yhyoxx: yep thanks
 AntiSquid: just valid move alone isn't enough
 AntiSquid: had to add random
 Hjax: straight random moves with no validity checking is fine for bronze
 Hjax: at least it worked for me 
 AntiSquid: didn't work for me first few tries though
 Hjax: maybe i just got lucky :D 
 AntiSquid: :thinking: maybe a demotion is warranted 
 inoryy: seems basic greedy approach is enough to get into bronze straight out of W2
 njaber: They should have just made the boss take random moves lol
 AntiSquid: we are talking about laziest possible bot to get to bronze inoryy :P
 yhyoxx: #demoteHjax
 Hjax: D: 
 yhyoxx: kidding x)
 njaber: not, promote this guy, he is a genius
 AntiSquid: #metoo
 AntiSquid: oh wrong hashtag
 Hjax: #blamejacek
 njaber: #HjaxInSilver
 njaber: just open the league in advance just for him
 AntiSquid: #HjaxLegendElect
 Gabbek: hmm
 Gabbek: can we somehow know how many potions the opponent has made?
 njaber: you can deduce it but you need to keep track of the potion list between turns
 inoryy: it's no 5 lines added to default but still &lt; 100 locs written in ~30min
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 njaber: waitno
 njaber: the points
 Hjax: check when they get rupees 
 njaber: how many times thei points changed
 Gabbek: oh, so true, thanks!'
 AntiSquid: last op command would be nicer
 inoryy: well, good contest, time to pretend I've got no time for it for the next 10 days
 njaber: ^
 AntiSquid: i actually don't
 AntiSquid: i move house + have to do some courses + there are some nice job postings i want to apply for :P
 Beresta: yay, bronze
 Gabbek: congrats
 Beresta: no more new rules later on, right?
 Cukinoden: could some one expalain for me what does it mean the last loop "for i in range(2)"
 Hjax: it gives you the inventory for each player
 njaber: I'm coding my own language, was hopping to finish it in time for the contest but I'm far from finished, I think I'll just go back to it and hope I'm finished for the next
 Hjax: your data is first, your opponent is second @Cukinoden
 Cukinoden: thanks
 AntiSquid: laters, have fun time! :P
 Gabbek: have a great one AntiSquid
 Gabbek: general tip for bronze: make sure you somehow manage your items well enough not to get stack
 Gabbek: that alone is worth tons of ranks
 Hjax: general tip for bronze, flip some coins 
 Hjax: :P
 Gabbek: ohh right
 qweoruqowrueoqwue: mmm
 inoryy: make sure not to flip tables though
 BenjaminUrquhart: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Hjax: ┬─┬ノ( ◕◡◕ ノ) 
 Gabbek: haha
 Gabbek: those are epic!
 njaber: Well since there are true random elements to this one I reckon at some points even good bots will have to take bets
 Hjax: this game is an acceptable amount of random 
 Hjax: and not a fog of war mess
 njaber: fog of war is fun, it makes deduction and induction a very important factor
 Hjax: it was not fun in pacman
 njaber: I like it personally
 Hjax: the, walk around the wrong corner and lose abruptly aspect was annoying 
 njaber: I got an almost perfect predictor for the opponent, but never made any use of it because my bot was sub-par appart from that
 Icebox: just track enemy lul
 njaber: wait not a predictor
 njaber: a traker
 njaber: tracker*
 Hjax: i had a tracker, still died randomly and horribly 
 njaber: then you weren't tracking good enough
 Hjax: sometimes you just dont know, you havent seen a pac for a long time 
 njaber: On the other hand my bot was often frozen in fear after a few turns realizing how many corners it could turns and get eaten at
 Gabbek: time to lose some ranks&#160;:)
 Gabbek: anyone checked recipes yet? are they all premade?
 ClockSort: I don't see any repeatability indicators in the visualizer (final rules). Is that normal?
 Gabbek: they are atleast visible on spell list in the middle
 Gabbek: not sure if they are visible on player's sides
 ClockSort: what do they look like in the middle?
 njaber: hover your mouse on them
 ClockSort: ah, repeatable: true
 ClockSort: why isn't that reflected in Deck.java of the provided source?
 ClockSort: oh, they are all repeatable? I now see, repeatable = IntStream.of(recipe.delta)
 ClockSort: I guess  they are repeatable if they consume anything. that answers my question.
 inoryy: ok I guess nobody else is trying to learn spells right now...
 Icebox: where?
 inoryy: nvm, misread initial replays
 inoryy: though not many are doing it for sure, adding even a simple heuristic helps a ton right now
 NicoNeko: :o
 Ille-Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/xilledanx">https://www.twitch.tv/xilledanx</a>
 inoryy: meh, can't figure out how to make repeatable useful
 Scarfield: oh thats an early stream&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how long it has been open?
 BryanGriffiths: meh, I made it to top 71 using my AI from Wood 1... LOL, So yeah no one is utilizing the tome yet.
 BryanGriffiths: 71 in the full leaderboard that is
 BenjaminUrquhart: I use it&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: still submitting though
 BryanGriffiths: yeah, I haven't even started on bronze yet, but surprised how high my wood 1 was without even adapting to the new rules
 BryanGriffiths: :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: same
 Gabbek: strange - seems like no matter what kind of brew I'm trying to make
 MadKnight: top-30 is using the tome BryanGriffiths and i got top-25 with my w1 bot
 Gabbek: I always land on #10 spot&#160;:/
 MadKnight: which league&#160;?
 Gabbek: so I would say it's all about resource management, atleast for now
 BryanGriffiths: nice @madKnight.
 DomiKo: right now it's for better random :sweat_smile:
 yhyoxx: any of you guys know any algorithms related ot resourse management for later on&#160;?
 BryanGriffiths: mine was simple greedy poition maker
 DomiKo: BFS bro
 Gabbek: even simple BFS should do well enough early on
 BryanGriffiths: no efficiency anywhere else
 MadKnight: and i made a pathfinder
 BryanGriffiths: Hmm only a 4 point difference. Intersting
 BenjaminUrquhart: woah I implemented something and it actually made my bot better :O
 ParticleBeam: Yay. Bronze
 BenjaminUrquhart: usually it makes things worse
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499748157">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499748157</a>crashing to victory
 eulerscheZahl: is that a bug? :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: lmao
 BenjaminUrquhart: didn't OOC have a similar issue
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i submitted that bot, performs poorly at the bottom&#160;:(
 Gabbek: hello eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: how was the kotlin toad
 Gabbek: how was the kotlin?
 ZarthaxX: i saw the first problem and was doable, but didnt know kotlin
 Gabbek: bah, ZarthaxX :D you're too fast!
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ZarthaxX: Gabbek LMAO
 eulerscheZahl: that's how it went
 ZarthaxX: next time gabbek :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: sad toad&#160;:(
 AlexisMolestos: ZarthaxX hello
 ZarthaxX: i saw gennady smashing, as always
 eulerscheZahl: and there are tshirts for top50 and 50 random winners
 ZarthaxX: AlexisMolestos hai man :O
 AlexisMolestos: I gonna participate
 Gabbek: I was hoping I can find something simple to improve atm - but no matter what kind of brew I'm going for... it seems to not matter at all for my rank :o
 AlexisMolestos: it seems difficult allthoug
 eulerscheZahl: i'm at the shared 132nd. but my last submission was a minute later, that's used as a tie breaker
 eulerscheZahl: 132 is a lucky random winner but it's not me&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: this chat is so extremely laggy. almost unusable
 ZarthaxX: AlexisMolestos nice nice, it's a bit messy :P
 eulerscheZahl: i write something and letters keep appearing 5s later
 Hjax: really? i havent had any problems with chat 
 Gabbek: no problems with chat at all either
 DomiKo: mod's have&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: we can see 2k users online
 eulerscheZahl: that seems to cause some hiccups
 eulerscheZahl: chromium is completely dead, firefox is laggy
 Gabbek: oh crap
 Hjax: need a smurf account lol 
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499754472">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499754472</a>
 Gabbek: spells spam :O
 LastRick: No lag for me using CHrome fwiw
 eulerscheZahl: you are no mod
 eulerscheZahl: i'm really tempted for the smurf
 struct: hmm i also get a little bit of lag
 struct: like 0.5 sec between each char
 struct: When I left tab open for a while it got slower
 Andriamanitra: this spell learning stuff is so complicated
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl just smurf and when you get to legend you submit with your main and delete the other
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ClockSort: what happens if you want to cast a spell that overflows your inventory? can you discard the lesser-value items clogging your inventory?
 BenjaminUrquhart: it fails iirc
 Andriamanitra: no, it just fails
 ClockSort: brutal.
 Andriamanitra: gotta make sure to manage inventory space
 BryanGriffiths: no chat lag here
 Gabbek: never thought I would have so much fun with random bot
 BryanGriffiths: Using chrome with a ton of tabs while simulating and coding
 Gabbek: just picking spells and doing whatever :D
 Clagus: random power!!1
 Gabbek: ClockSort inventory management is really crucial, very easy to get stuck otherwise
 Meme_Magician: I'm having a big problem with my AI for the Fall Challenge... The debug messages say it's brewing potions, but it always wait on the first turn - without printing the corresponding debug message for waiting!
 Meme_Magician: *waits
 Nerchio: maybe you print with error output instead of normal output idk?
 ionutzxy: helloy guys
 Liora: are you sure you didn't just forget to remove the default output of wait?
 ionutzxy: how can you find out if the spell is yours or not?
 Meme_Magician: @Nerchio I have been using the error output
 Liora: I think both witch have the same spells?
 Kathrin: use the action type to check if its yours or not
 AlexisMolestos: I gonna win I know it :grin:
 ionutzxy: it's also spell for the opponent
 ionutzxy: should I just divide by 2?
 Meme_Magician: I'm in Wood 2 right now, the only actions are 'brew' and 'wait'
 ionutzxy: and get the first half?
 ionutzxy: there is no simpler solution?
 Kathrin: no actiontype is cast or opponent_cast (at least in wood 1) does it change later on?
 ionutzxy: ah ok
 ionutzxy: in wood 2 you have also spell
 ionutzxy: which you can CAST
 Nerchio: no you don't in wood2
 Nerchio: wood2 is just brewing
 Nerchio: wood1 is spells
 Clagus: so the deck of spells is predefined, and also the deck of orders?
 Nerchio: as far as i know orders are not predefined
 ionutzxy: wood 1 sorry
 Clagus: Nerchio - look here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 Clagus: seems like deliveries are defined
 aristotelis-bobas: how do you know how many times you can cast a spell if its repeatable?
 eulerscheZahl: as often as you have input stones
 Clagus: don't know what are deliveries though :P
 ionutzxy: you have to rest
 ionutzxy: and the it will be available again
 Nerchio: Clagus i don't think its delivieries
 Nerchio: or maybe :o
 Clagus: it seems like it has recipe + reward
 tobk: Do casts always increase the "tier" of the ingredients?
 DomiKo: no
 BrunoFelthes: wood1 yes
 tobk: seemed like it in wood 1, but probably will get more erratic in bronze, right? would have been to easy
 Nerchio: Can't find some recipes there though so not sure
 Clagus: Nerchio - ok, interesting
 Nerchio: nvm missed it so i guess they are predefined
 Clagus: yeah, I'm checking now, and can't find anything outside of this predefined deck
 Clagus: nice try trolling me though :D
 Clagus: but maybe they will change it later
 Clagus: it would be nice to know :D
 Nerchio: in ruleset i found that spells have a predefined deck but nothing said about recipes
 Clagus: yeah, I know, I went to github just to check out the spells, and found more :P
 NoahAnteau: hello
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wood2 action is kinda nutz
 tibithegreat: sorry if this was asked before, but is there a limit to the number of spells?
 Meme_Magician: I figured out the next step, but still need help
 Gabbek: tibithegreat nope, but there's 52 spells in a tome
 Meme_Magician: It's telling me, `Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.`
 Meme_Magician: But I'm reading every piece of it
 tibithegreat: ok, thanks
 Gabbek: Meme_Magician you're most likely outputing multiple commands in a single turn
 Meme_Magician: Gabbek I checked, and each command has a debug message associated with it, so I would've seen both messages if there were multiple actions
 Gabbek: Meme_Magician try to output just wait and see if you get a warning
 Gabbek: WAIT command I mean
 Cukinoden: why they show me this message&#160;? 
 Cukinoden: "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 Gabbek: same reason as above, Cukinoden
 MadKnight: how do u check for 50ms in c#&#160;?
 MadKnight: Cukinoden because your code timed out&#160;?
 Gabbek: MadKnight most likely stopwatch
 Meme_Magician: Gabbek Doesn't help much; now it just WAITs twice. Before, the AI clearly selected a brew potion action, then waited until next turn to produce the action
 Meme_Magician: I take it Python won't be fast enough for this competition?
 ParticleBeam: System.Diagnostics
 tempux: if you want to be top 50, python is not fast enough
 NoahAnteau: i can not figure  this out:disappointed:
 Meme_Magician: Gosh darn it.
 Meme_Magician: Gotta recode everything in C++ now
 Meme_Magician: (grouchy mumbling)
 tempux: its fine it is still its day 1&#160;:)) 
 Meme_Magician: Yeah, I know, I just expected to be faster than this
 Hjax: i bet there will be a python in the top 50
 Meme_Magician: I'll be mad abt it if there is
 jacek: i would still work on heuristic before switching to c++
 Hjax: this game is heuristic friendly enough for python i think
 Meme_Magician: jacek the only issue with my heuristic is that it's timing out the game
 sadakatsu: I plan to read through the GitHub code later to try to understand the Bronze+ mechanics.  My immediate question is, "What happens when the two players try to learn the same spell?"  For some reason that is never explicitly stated...
 cypy: memoization
 Meme_Magician: Either that of I have to make the inputs match up somehow
 BenjaminUrquhart: sadakatsu they both get the spell
 sadakatsu: That MIGHT be stated in, "When both witches perform the same action, they both reap the rewards for that action. This applies namely to potion prices, the urgency bonus, the read-ahead tax, and learning spells," but if so, I am somehow still confused.
 tempux: the spring competition I got around top 100  and there were only two other pythons better than me
 tempux: you can search far enough with python, using c++ you can search so much deeper
 Recovery_disaster: will the spells be the same for every league?
 Gabbek: starting spells, yes
 Recovery_disaster: Oh, so you get more spells later which are random&#160;?
 Gabbek: in which league are you, Recovery?
 struct: There are at total 42 spells
 inoryy: eulerscheZahl php?!
 Recovery_disaster: still wood 1 ...
 Gabbek: in bronze you unlock tome and there's total of 52 spells
 Gabbek: oh, 42 - sorry
 Hjax: are the recipes randomly generated 
 Hjax: or are there a fixed number of those too 
 struct: I do think recipees are random
 Hjax: i wonder if this will be like locm where someone worked out how good each spell is 
 Hjax: and just had a fixed greedy draft order 
 lxnn: Is it possible to turn the suggestions box in the editor off? I couldn't find a setting for this. Might be blind...&#160;:)
 MadKnight: now with stopwatch it always timeouts
 sadakatsu: My current plan is to try to pick my next move as though the current options are the only ones that will ever be available  ^_^;
 struct: lxnn I think the most you can do is disable "accpet suggestion on enter key"
 lxnn: Ah right. Thanks. Might try out the auto-uploader thing.
 inoryy: Hjax <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java#L13-L92">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java#L13-L92</a>
 Hjax: ah, they are hard coded 
 Hjax: thanks inoryy :D 
 inoryy: though they are randomized <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L141-L142">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L141-L142</a>
 inoryy: the order that is
 Hjax: sure, but this means theres room to do some analysis 
 struct: Deliveries are orders right?
 Hjax: on what kind of recipes are likely / what spells help the most recipes 
 tutubalin: Why (1, 3, 1, 1) recipe worth 18 rupees, and (1, 1, 3, 1) worth only 16?
 SpaghettiCode: omg the challenge is so cool, but I think i'm too noob... i'm already stuck at wood league lmfao
 inoryy: hah, Psyho taking part in the contest
 Hjax: because 1,1,3,1 tastes bad
 Hjax: the customers dont like it 
 Hjax: psyho was really good at halite right?
 Hjax: like, re curse good 
 inoryy: yes, he's from openAI afaik
 Hjax: fun, i like seeing scary people join 
 kovi: not just halite. psyho is probably best topcoder marathonist
 jthemphill: is the challenge a reskin of century spice road?
 Gabbek: whoa :o
 struct: They mentioned spice road yes jthemphill
 Avrem: if you take an action, is it removed from the action input in the next read?
 jthemphill: struct cool, thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes it is Avrem
 tutubalin: Also(2, 0, 2, 2) = 15(2, 2, 0, 2) = 17
 BenjaminUrquhart: less is more clearly
 tutubalin: So tier1 is better than tier2
 Hjax: spells are not removed, brews are removed 
 Hjax: spells just become exhausted 
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy PHP for hardcoding <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/7?u=eulerschezahl">https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/7?u=eulerschezahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: beats top players but fails at the bottom&#160;:(
 inoryy: lol
 tutubalin: Again:(0, 0, 2, 3) = 16(0, 2, 0, 3) = 18
 BenjaminUrquhart: known bug
 Hjax: it doesnt really matter of the potions have consistent values 
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/8?u=benjaminurquhart">https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/8?u=benjaminurquhart</a>
 GiraffeKing: It's not about which ingredients go in; the potions have a random value based on their usefulness.
 BryanGriffiths: I just assumed potions are random values and there for I do a price vs time to make check to choose the best one
 tutubalin: value is not random, it is hardcoded.but it looks like both in receipts and book spells tier-1 and tier-2 are swapped
 tobk: wow, bronze is getting quite complicated...
 Waffle3z: oh wow I'm in 6th
 BryanGriffiths: @tutubalin yeah I know, but at least when they fix the code my code doesn't need to change.  ;)
 lNitsua: I kinda wish I could do this challenge in matlab
 lNitsua: matrix operations and symbolic math would make programming this so easy
 Cappefra: right? hahahaha
 Cappefra: Was thinking the same
 Meme_Magician: Figured it
 lxnn: I think numpy library is provided for Python.
 Scarfield: could use numpy in python
 lxnn: jinx
 lNitsua: I have never worked in python
 Scarfield: :zipper_mouth:
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/499807936">https://www.codingame.com/replay/499807936</a>
 karliso: Turn 5. It looks to me like red player manges to play non-repeatable cast repeatedly on same turn.
 BryanGriffiths: weird I just see a black screen with the progress abrs showing who scored
 Nerchio: shows repeatable to me karliso
 Nerchio: in ui
 BenjaminUrquhart: not me
 BenjaminUrquhart: unless we're looking at the wrong spell
 Glenn: Only one action id is given per round. How do I get the id for the other 4 orders?
 BenjaminUrquhart: spell 90 is being cast that turn, it does not look repeatable
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.nani.rocks/yr/PfcEja.png">https://i.nani.rocks/yr/PfcEja.png</a>
 tutubalin: karliso also i can't find when he learned this spell
 Nerchio: ah I see i looked at turn 6, thats true
 karliso: tutubalin Turn 4
 Nerchio: he casts unrepeatable twice
 karliso: yeah, looks like a bug t me
 ClosetAI: Yeah I've noticed the bug with repeatable flag as well
 Snap997: i hate coding&#160;:(
 tutubalin: karliso ah, yes. id has changed
 ClockSort: looks like items don't show as repeatable on the side panels. but they still might be. they show their repeatable state while still in the tome list.
 Scarfield: they show if they are repeatable in both the tome and spell list, guessing it is a bug as well
 karliso: When I read inputs from tome list it says that card is not repeatable.
 Scarfield: it also shows as not repeatable in replay, he just has the power to recast it :p
 Scarfield: weird, i just tried recasting a not repeatble spell, didnt work: "attempted an invalid action:Spell 78 is not repeatable"
 BenjaminUrquhart: a wild euler appeared
 Scarfield: use Masterball
 ClockSort: is `castable` starts at 1, then 0 if you use, then 1 when you rest?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry BenjaminUrquhart. euler has to go to bed soon, the cat is already waiting
 lNitsua: castable also appears to always be 0 for potions
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl yes the cat is more important, better take care of that
 eulerscheZahl: will do, good nicht
 eulerscheZahl: night
 eulerscheZahl: i hate blind typing, laggy chat
 Icebox: going to sleep already?
 Zilvester: Looking at the Github code, I see the source for the spells. But has anybody found a static list of "brews" (or are they randomly generated)? I'm trying to calculate the relative frequencies of the different ingredients.
 eulerscheZahl: i urgently need an alt, first thing tomorrow :D
 Icebox: wait, why alt?
 BenjaminUrquhart: secret alt or no
 eulerscheZahl: why aren't you a chat mod icebox?
 Cappefra: I gotta say I wasn't expecting to have to perform matrix inversion
 BenjaminUrquhart: probably to test against
 Icebox: I don't know, why am I not?
 eulerscheZahl: there are like 2k users on the chat. and a mod can see all of them. causes a huge lag
 eulerscheZahl: i even switched to firefox for chatting as chromium keeps crashing
 Scarfield: a mod breaking the rules openly :o
 Gabbek: euler, damn you :p stop beating my randomness! :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have random too
 eulerscheZahl: but i seeded my RNG
 MadKnight: because Icebox only comes for contests?
 Gabbek: oh, that's too powerful, hehe
 eulerscheZahl: so, good night for real now
 Gabbek: good night
 Scarfield: 7, 8
 Icebox: MadKnight thats not true
 Icebox: I've been grinding golf for the last 2 weeks as well
 Icebox: got to top 5 on py on thor

 Gabbek: omg
 Gabbek: this copy
 Gabbek: delete this link please!&#160;:(
 Zilvester: cancel my last question - found it
 BenjaminUrquhart: quick, someone send 20 messages so it gets lost 
 Gabbek: hdhsj
 Gabbek: vncxnx
 Gabbek: hsfhsd
 Scarfield: xD
 Zilvester: like this...
 BenjaminUrquhart: I was joking
 Gabbek: any mod around to delete it please?
 struct: We can't delete it sorry
 BenjaminUrquhart: can't delete chat messages
 Scarfield: i dont think you can delete a message
 struct: At least its not full code
 Scarfield: yea, and early in the contest
 Andriamanitra: in wood league i think yes, after that it gets more complicated
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/499838817">https://www.codingame.com/replay/499838817</a> turn 37 basic spell gets thrown out?
 AntiSquid: just ping Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN a few times
 ParticleBeam: I wonder if quoting the "jabberwocky" would be enough
 Gabbek: *confused*
 Andriamanitra: oh i was scrolled waaayyy up
 Automaton2000: i thought about it and i have a simple eval
 AutomatonNN: why not make the league of really slow on the boss?
 Scarfield: phew
 tutubalin: karliso interesting thing: according to referee code, when you learn a spell, it becomes repeatable automatically
 BenjaminUrquhart: hm
 AntiSquid: only some spells are repeatable though right? or is that a bug?
 Gabbek: how do I lose a basic spell on turn 37?&#160;:(
 tomatoes: thats only player
 tomatoes: visual
 Gabbek: ohh
 Gabbek: okey, thanks a lot tomatoes
 Scarfield: yea tried casting a spell twice, didnt work, so its not a bug for all spells at least
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damnit, does a casting sequence always exist to find a brew?
 AntiSquid: my mental image of that username: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWP-SpendWithPennies-Tomato-Salad-27.jpg">https://www.spendwithpennies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWP-SpendWithPennies-Tomato-Salad-27.jpg</a>
 AntiSquid: every time .
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So it took a boss 21 turns to brew, holy hell
 AntiSquid: well it's wood
 AntiSquid: also 1800 people in wood @_@
 AntiSquid: 2500 bots on first day that's something special
 Scarfield: yea, more than most contest has had for participants overall iirc?
 natec360: well I'm straight up bad so that's why I'm in wood
 lNitsua: covid got people hoping this game will get them a job
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I at least thought wood1 would be a depth 0 casting solution for a brew
 AntiSquid: pacman had close to 5k Scarfield . well actually pacman was most popular contest
 Scarfield: wood usually is just about implementing the rules of the game, stategy starts at bronze
 Hjax: pacman has already been dethroned in terms of signups
 tutubalin: AntiSquid this is a bug with repeatable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/13?u=tutubalin">https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/13?u=tutubalin</a>
 AntiSquid: depends, you have all rules in bronze so imo that's where you start implementing the rules, wood is to get familiar with the game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a depth 20 casting solution with rests may be unnattainable for alot of people
 Scarfield: yea it seems i recalled incorrectly :p
 tutubalin: Scarfield this bug is for learnt spells only. doesn't affect default spells
 Scarfield: oh, for every learnt spell then? still in wood so i cant test
 AntiSquid: nah you do you Scarfield . but imo you have to redo a lot if there's a new rule added
 Astrobytes: Not sure if I'm motivated to even continue lol
 Hjax: whats wrong astro?
 Astrobytes: I don't like it :P
 Scarfield: i meant recalled incorrectly about the no. of participants, i pretty much meant what you said about wood squiddy, just phrased it badly
 Hjax: D:
 Astrobytes: It's like CalM + C4L, neither of which I liked
 Scarfield: CastroBytes
 Hjax: yeah definitely seems like those two games mixed together 
 Astrobytes: RecallField
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6c59b24b-1eaa-40de-a331-621b02884bdd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6c59b24b-1eaa-40de-a331-621b02884bdd</a>
 AntiSquid: i don't see the CalM part
 Scarfield: xD
 BenjaminUrquhart: C4L but less state machine
 AntiSquid: i liked a la mode
 Scarfield: total recallField
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I'll probably have a go at it but I'm not keen
 AntiSquid: i guess the recipes aspect&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yep
 Paluke: Help please: I am trying to do this challenge in TS. How to set type for readline() and printerr()&#160;? I am stuck.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cast 78 cast 79 rest cast 79 rest cast 79 rest cast 79 rest cast 79 brew 0  is some BS!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for wood1
 Paluke: It was simply `/* globals readline, printErr */` in plain JS
 AntiSquid: i still have yet to sort by recipe and add pathing to my CALM bot so ... maybe the recipe sorting isn't most important part of this game either
 Paluke: I get "Cannot find name 'readline'." error
 Hjax: python + numpy is definitely easier 
 AntiSquid: python ofc
 Astrobytes: quicker for sure
 Hjax: better is up to debate, but certainly easier 
 lNitsua: guess it's time to learn python
 lNitsua: thanks
 AntiSquid: even doing machine learning in python is easier than mastering C  :D
 Astrobytes: *quicker to learn I mean
 BenjaminUrquhart: lmao that bottom spell <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499863096">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/499863096</a>
 dreadylein: also mastering c normaly means messing up slightly less then all the other :D 
 BenjaminUrquhart: frame 34+
 Andriamanitra: no such thing as "mastering C", the language is so dead simple you can learn all of it in a couple days
 RohanasaurusRex: so how long have you guys been programming for?
 BenjaminUrquhart: a time
 RohanasaurusRex: nice
 RohanasaurusRex: lol
 dreadylein: @Andriamanitra the same is true for asm, but both also give you all the tools to shoot into your own foot reeealy easy :P
 Astrobytes: Benjamin was born in the JVM
 Astrobytes: :P
 inoryy: that reminds me of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Qfjgm8h.png">https://i.imgur.com/Qfjgm8h.png</a>
 Gabbek: Hjax seems like getting stuck with having lots of ways of generating 3 but not 4 tiers is really painful, gotta pick those spells nicely&#160;:|
 BenjaminUrquhart: you don't know me
 BenjaminUrquhart: I started in python
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 Astrobytes: lol inoryy
 dreadylein: lol inorry :D
 Astrobytes: calm down Benjamin it was a joke
 Astrobytes: So toucheh
 BenjaminUrquhart: I know
 Gabbek: haha, that's a good one inorry
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have difficulty with tone in text so yeah that came off a bit aggressive
 BenjaminUrquhart: mb
 Astrobytes: Benjamin was born in a snake&#160;;)
 dreadylein: the thing with asking , how long are you coding is, tons of people feel old about 3 seconds after its asked :P
 Scarfield: xD
 SamSev: hello
 dreadylein: hi
 Astrobytes: no agression or anything intended in the slightest BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: think this is my 5th year programming
 Scarfield: agrestroBytes
 BenjaminUrquhart: Astrobytes the aggression was on my end, not yours
 Andriamanitra: i've been programming 10-ish years, never regularly enough to get good though
 BenjaminUrquhart: :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: case in point then :D
 Gabbek: inoryy you're doing search or something random, if I may ask?
 AntiSquid: i see i should focus on reversing aging instead of being here
 dreadylein:&#160;;)
 inoryy: no search, bunch of greedy decisions that fit in &lt; 100 loc
 Scarfield: it takes 40 years to do so apperently
 Gabbek: interesting
 AntiSquid: you have all of eternity afterwards 
 inoryy: pick a potion to brew first then build your invertory for it
 RohanasaurusRex: ok thank you i was just curious because im pretty new
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid find a way to synth <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Adrenochrome">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Adrenochrome</a> and make a B $
 Andriamanitra: you seem to have a pretty good score without doing search, this gives me hope :D
 inoryy: I wouldn't read too much into it, people writing search are busy debugging their segfaults
 Andriamanitra: i don't have a search either and i am 100% sure i won't be able to write one for this either
 Gabbek: ^-- indeed
 inoryy: I would be surprised if my bot would get through to silver without changes
 Avrem: is this the global chat? or wood chat
 BenjaminUrquhart: global
 Scarfield: global
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's no such thing as league-specific chats
 Scarfield: the chat name is viewed in the top "world"&#160;:)
 struct: silver is only in 4 days
 struct: But I think if you are currently top 5 you should be safe
 Avrem: not gonna lie, the IDE makes it hard to debug
 Jdools05: I just started the challenge, can someone explain to me what the second for loop does? I know it is used for the inventory, but why does it loop twice?
 Scarfield: just write your code in Word, its where its at
 Scarfield: for both players
 Scarfield: Jdools05
 dreadylein: 2 player
 BenjaminUrquhart: second time around is opponent inventory 
 v1993: One for your inventory, once for your enemy's
 Hjax: what happens if you try to cast a spell that produces more resources than you have room for 
 BenjaminUrquhart: fails
 Fosfen: it fails 
 Hjax: ah cant cast at all?
 Hjax: ok 
 BenjaminUrquhart: nope
 Jdools05: ah thank you, i did not know that
 struct: wait what?
 Scarfield: i thought it only discharded what couldnt fit?
 BenjaminUrquhart: too little space means no spell
 Jdools05: thats probably why my code was selecting weird spells
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's only for learning from tome
 struct: if you dont have space for the resources that the spell generates it fails?
 Hjax: the tax is discarded when it wont fit 
 Scarfield: ooh
 Hjax: rules dont say anything about spell outputs 
 Fosfen: Is a graph approach a good idea for this challenge&#160;? 
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah discard only applies to tome tax 
 BenjaminUrquhart: Fosfen depends on what you want to do, I use a graph only because that's what I'm used to and it's working pretty well so far
 Fosfen: Thanks 
 Andriamanitra: i think graph would be the most logical way to approach it, but that said it's not what i did at all :D
 Gabbek: so how do leagues work in contest? One of the codes get's chosen from bronze, like the top 20%ish or something?
 struct: yes 
 hem123: Question for the fall challenge
 hem123: how can one use cast id times if you need to rest after the use of a spell
 Scarfield: somes spells are repeatable
 Hurda: Gabbek - every tiem you submit you play against everyone in the league. Each league has a boss (AI) - you have to have better score than teh boss to pass up
 ParticleBeam: I believe you can cast it multiple times in one round after which it gets exhausted
 hem123: @Scarfield is there a limit on repeats?
 Gabbek: repeats has no limit, apart from your inventory space
 Scarfield: afaik your inventory
 struct: Hjax <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/499881546">https://www.codingame.com/replay/499881546</a>
 struct: I guess this answers it
 ParticleBeam: I think its only limited by the amount of ingredients you have
 Gabbek: but it'll get exhausted after using it
 Gabbek: Hurda thanks a lot&#160;:)
 struct: "struct attempted an invalid action:Not enough space in inventory for spell 86"
 Scarfield: hem123 no need for "@" in chat here, also you can autocomplete usernames: scar[tab] -&gt; Scarfield
 hem123: ta
 RockyMullet: I dont understand tax
 struct: Rocky
 struct: so from bot to top
 struct: if you want imagine 3rd spell
 struct: 1st and 2nd get taxed + 1 each
 Cappefra: the tome is wild...
 struct: with tier 0 igredients
 ParticleBeam: You can learn the first item from a tome for free. If you want to skip to learn the next one, you have to pay a tier-0 ingredient per skip.
 ParticleBeam: You can learn the first item from a tome for free. If you want to skip to learn the next one, you have to pay a tier-0 ingredient per skip.
 RockyMullet: so I need to spend 2 tier 0 ^
 struct: When someone  picks that spell they get those igredients
 RockyMullet: oooooh
 struct: Yes
 RockyMullet: you should be writting the statement lol
 RockyMullet: thanks
 struct: np
 Scarfield: interesting kind of tax, it gets payed back to whoever buys the next product
 tutubalin: i find tier-X term a bit anti-ergonomic.we'd better choose other terms like Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow.or D, C, B, A
 Scarfield: damn my spelling is way off today 
 Gabbek: the tax thing is really interesting
 Scarfield: yea, seems like there are some strats in the tax/inventory department
 Gabbek: yeah, started collecting tax - looks really good
 Gabbek: apart from ahem inventory management which I dont have :D
 Gabbek: suddenly losing pretty much all via full inventory, hehe
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: the tax collector struggling from succes
 Doju: Does anybody know what all of the possible actions are?
 struct: Learn, Cast, Rest and Brew
 Paluke: How to make Typescript ignore readline and printErr?
 Doju: I mean in terms of values
 Remus_: Can I test on a specific seed? My code doesn't pick anything in like 1 out of 30 battles.&#160;:(
 Paluke: in plain JS it was /* globals readline, printErr */
 struct: Remus_ you can
 Xenoid: The action types are "CAST", "OPPONENT_CAST", "LEARN", and "BREW"
 struct: enable expert mode on settings
 struct: then you can choose seed
 Doju: yes thank you, but i mean like deltas for example
 Doju: what are all of the possible deltas
 Doju: there has to be a fixed amount, right?
 Remus_: Thanks!&#160;:)
 tutubalin: Doju <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 Doju: Oh nice, that's exactly what i was looking for. thanks tutubalin
 Gabbek: tax collecting seems to be very powerful, just need to manage your inventory well enough&#160;:|
 tutubalin: Doju it may change a bit soon. so keep an eye on it
 Icebox: wait a minute
 Icebox: I've read the chat about repeatable spells being bugged
 Icebox: but how exactly?
 Icebox: now I'm scared to implement it
 Gabbek: Icebox the other way around - non-repeatable are repeatable
 Icebox: and repeatable aren't?
 Gabbek: which should not be the case (but dunno exactly how it works, just seen it being mentioned earlier)
 Gabbek: repeatable are
 Scarfield: learned spells are apparently bugged, all repeatable(?)
 Icebox: so basically all spells are repeatable except the starting ones?
 struct: yes Scarfield
 Scarfield: i think so
 struct: Icebox its bugged
 Gabbek: yes, but that's a bug
 Scarfield: i know so * :p
 Icebox: nah nah struct
 Icebox: it's a feature
 Scarfield: xD
 inoryy: as long as you rely on repeatable flag from inputs you'll be fine even after it's fixed
 Icebox: I knew that Oioi was hacking
 Icebox: kappa
 Icebox: dude made the bug into a feature 
 Icebox: literally
 Scarfield: its cost effective!
 Scarfield: free turns ftw
 Gabbek: well, I must say that contests are really fun!
 Gabbek: this is my first one and I'm having a blast; such a friendly community and awesome conversations, a huge thank you to everyone&#160;:)
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Gabbek: Hjax have you started with the contest?
 MadKnight: he already got bronze
 casmith789: what's the silver/gold/legend leagues for?
 KleinesAtom93: Is it possible to already get promoted to silver or is everyone in the bronze league atm? Sorry, my first contest :X
 casmith789: it says they are locked until the 16th
 BenjaminUrquhart: silver opens later
 Xenoid: For glory, @casmith789. They will open later in the week
 Scarfield: highest league currently is bronze, silver will open in 4 days
 Gabbek: KleinesAtom93 it will be open on 16th
 KleinesAtom93: alright, ty!&#160;:)
 casmith789: do you just get promoted if you do well in bronze then? when it opens
 inoryy: aim for top~30% if you want to get auto-promoted
 Xenoid: The highest ranked players in Bronze will form the Silver league when it opens, and other players can get promoted by beating the boss, which is usually derived from the highest ranked player in Bronze at the cut
 Scarfield: KleinesAtom93 if you click on the League symbol next to "Fall Challenge 2020" you can always see when the next league will open
 Icebox: screenshot collection extended
 Icebox: #1
 Gabbek: hehe, congrats
 RockyMullet: this submit got me from ~500th to 21st, I'd say it's a good submit&#160;:)
 dreadylein: grats&#160;:)
 inoryy: nice
 Gabbek: RockyMullet beautiful!&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: fixed my spell learning, I didnt realized it had such a big impact haha
 RockyMullet: inoryy 11th&#160;! doing good&#160;:)
 inoryy: thanks!
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/499930095">https://www.codingame.com/replay/499930095</a>
 Gabbek: so that's how you use repeatable actions...
 Gabbek: *amazed*
 Doju: I just don't have the same excitement over this game compared to the spring challenge...
 RockyMullet: oooh thats how
 Gabbek: but I'm confused - is free green supposed to be repeatable?
 Remus_: wow
 Gabbek: doesn't say so on the tooltip, hmm
 RockyMullet: oh drifted 15th, the CG gods are too good with me
 Gabbek: hehe, hi Rocky :D
 Gabbek: let's hold the ground together :P
 Doju: Do you guys already have working searches?
 RockyMullet: next to each other, gatekeeping the top
 RockyMullet: me not yet, but im only 16th
 Gabbek: so apparently people are using all spells as repeatable now
 RockyMullet: gotta read how this thing work
 RockyMullet: but it's probably not useful before you get a search
 Gabbek: pretty sure it's bugged - even those spells which have no repeatable tag
 Gabbek: are being repeated
 RockyMullet: pretty sure Romka already has one
 Gabbek: unless I'm missing something crucial
 inoryy: it's bugged <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/13">https://forum.codingame.com/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495/13</a>
 Gabbek: thank you for the link, let me have a look
 Gabbek: oh, well that kills that insane performance, sure - still need to devise a plan how to even go about search
 Gabbek: but that atleast explains it a bit, thank you inoryy
 Icebox: lmao I got to 100% dropping only 2 out of 70 games
 Icebox: one against 2nd and one against 5th
 Icebox: and I ruined it
 Gabbek: Icebox are you using repeatable actions?
 Icebox: yes
 Gabbek: just wondering
 DomiKo: i need to debug my&#160;:(
 Gabbek: with spells that are not repeatable, correct?
 Icebox: I got 1st without that
 Icebox: but this "flex" submit inclused that, yes
 Icebox: included*
 Gabbek: fair enough, was curious, thanks&#160;:)
 DomiKo: we can feel the diference
 inoryy: weird flex but ok
 Icebox: ah, a fellow youngster
 inoryy: insert matt damon meme here
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnPWJOJYVKc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnPWJOJYVKc</a>
 inoryy: lol I meant this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/852/325/8d6.gif">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/852/325/8d6.gif</a>
 Recovery_disaster: Can I get the urgend bonus from the input, or do I need to calculate it myself?

 Icebox: I'll keep the spot 1 warm for you DomiKo
 Icebox: come and get it
 DomiKo: mmmm
 DomiKo: I have to check if I will timeout or not
 DomiKo: and I guess I have somebugs 
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 DomiKo: give me sometime
 PatrickMcGinnisII: more movement in wood1 than i have seen in awhile
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/499947807">https://www.codingame.com/replay/499947807</a>
 DomiKo: what happend there
 DomiKo: he had 50 points
 DomiKo: made 18 points potion
 DomiKo: and boom 69 points
 Gabbek: you get +1 point for all tier-1 and higher ingrements
 Gabbek: in your inventory
 DomiKo: ohhhhhh
 Gabbek: quote: "Players gain 1 rupee for each tier-1 ingredient or higher in their inventory."
 Subsage: after each action, we get orders *up to some number*, but what about ingredients? Do they also refill, and at what rate, if any?
 Gabbek: oh, so if I'm not mistaken -- all learned spells are repeatable at the moment?&#160;:(
 Gabbek: Subsage which league are we talking about?
 Subsage: 2nd one, just unlocked spells
 Gabbek: ingredients don't refill at all, you have to cast spells in order to gain additional resources
 Gabbek: from wood 1 and onwards
 Subsage: so if I were to exhaust my inventory, that's it for me then? Just hardlocked
 Drallieiv: Is that me or does it return "attempted an invalid action:Tried to cast an opponent's spell..."If I try to cast one of my spell that will make me over 10 ingredients
 Gabbek: not at all - you have the basic spell of creating 2 tier-0 ingredients
 Gabbek: (and spell becomes exhausted, but you can use rest action in order to make all spells available again)
 Subsage: I see, but nonetheless, all generation of inventory is from our own actions. Interesting, thanks for the info!
 Gabbek: aye, from our actions indeed, you're welcome&#160;:)
 SpaghettiCode: lol how tf am i top 10 in wood 1
 SpaghettiCode: my bot is terrible
 ivan44: what's the purpose of `OPPONENT_CAST`?
 Drallieiv: you could see if the opponent can snipe the potion you plan on doing before u
 Drallieiv: if he can do it in 2 turns, while you need 3, you now the client may disappear first
 Luca_Poda: someone know why happen this? "attempted an invalid action:Command does not match action, expected 'CAST' but got 'BREW'"
 Xenoid: You have to brew potions and cast spells
 Luca_Poda: Ok thank you but why does the program tell me to cast and not to brew?
 Xenoid: Most likely, because you output a command like 'BREW 17' but 17 was the ID of a spell, not a potion
 Luca_Poda: Ok thanks you so much
 Xenoid: No problem
 Zenoscave: Finally got a chance to sit down for the challenge
 Gabbek: hello Zeno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: good, push me out of wood1 plz
 Zenoscave: Hi noname
 Zenoscave: Hi PatrickMcGinnisII
 dreadylein: hi
 SpaghettiCode: is it possible to be demoted from a league?
 Zenoscave: no SpaghettiCode
 SpaghettiCode: nice
 Gabbek: how's going RockyMullet?
 RockyMullet: found a bug in my learning stuff, scrashing my head so far
 Hjax: Zenoscave same, unfair europeans get a head start, i was at work all day :P
 RockyMullet: oh you gave me 3 victory, really nice of you :P
 Zenoscave: I was moving a friend into a new appratment
 Zenoscave: no work currnetly
 Gabbek: haha, yeah enjoy :D trying some experiments and this one seems to be quite a bad one
 LastRick: That leap in difficulty from Wood 2 to 1 shocked me. 
 Samer: hey guys, is the list of spells always constant?
 tomatoes: yes, but shuffled
 RockyMullet: 100% win in 20 games, submit looking good :D
 Gabbek: good luck RockyMullet!
 RockyMullet: first lost at 27 games :cry:
 Gabbek: gonna gift you some wins, hehe :P
 RockyMullet: ty for the generous gift :P
 RockyMullet: lost 3 times in a row against icebox
 RockyMullet: lol i pushed icebox first
 Ille-Stream: Damn, top 3 is in a different league
 RockyMullet: aaand lost against romka, everything back to normal lol
 Gabbek: seems like I'll be stuck around #20 ish for now
 Gabbek: just losing too much games against top 10
 Ille-Stream: Stream ended top 13 \o/
 RockyMullet: gj
 dreadylein: grats&#160;:)
 Gabbek: great job Ille-Stream&#160;:)
 Ille-Stream: Oh, wrong account. brb
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: stabilized 11th :D
 Gabbek: nice!
 RockyMullet: strating to smell like sim/search, I doubt I can cheat my way higher than that
 Illedan: agreed
 Gabbek: same here, unless you manage to get a really good inventory management
 Gabbek: then you probably can cheat a bit higher
 RockyMullet: Illedan will you submit your stream code on Illedan&#160;?
 Subsage: looking at leader board, is the number with arrows the score?
 Illedan: Sure, but gotta fix it first. Not going to accept worse than top 10 :P
 RockyMullet: see you in 3 days lol
 RockyMullet: jk jk
 Illedan: I'll leave stream code though, as a reference
 ClockSort: how do i view matches between the top players?
 Illedan: leaderboard =&gt; last battles =&gt; watch
 RockyMullet: Subsage yes, thats how the ranking is done
 Illedan: ClockSort, you need to go to the contest landing page and not the IDE
 Gabbek: Rocky - I thought I'm gonna go high but it seems I'm getting a bit stuck with inventory against low, so dropping tons of ranks :D
 Subsage: Thanks Rocky
 RockyMullet: whats wrong with your inventory&#160;?
 RockyMullet: np
 Gabbek: likes to get stuck with tier3 or tier4 :D
 ClockSort: um, it looks like top players are repeating non-repeatable spells?
 ClockSort: is that a bug?
 Gabbek: yes
 Gabbek: but it kind of happens naturally if you try to implement repeatable because of the bug
 John.Pop: Does any one action cost the same amount of time?
 RockyMullet: oh yeah, I could still cheat my way up by implementing repeat cast
 Gabbek: true
 RockyMullet: ooooh I see sneaky people abusing the bug of repeating non repeatable spells
 RockyMullet: that could help too
 Illedan: Oh, you can repeat them all? :P
 DomiKo: dont do that&#160;;(
 Gabbek: Illedan yeah
 RockyMullet: from what i understand the bug is, if you cast a repeatable first, you can repeat all of them after, even non repeatable
 MattSOrme: If its a bug then how about just not using it? since it'll get patched anyway?
 ZarthaxX: for the lolz
 RockyMullet: the lolz are fun yes
 ZarthaxX: and also for the carne master
 Gabbek: I guess I'll try to defend top 20 with my randomness
 RockyMullet: anyway im not even using the ones that are not a bug
 ZarthaxX: Gabbek gl :P
 Icebox: RockyMullet no I don't think it works like that
 Icebox: I think you can cast all non-repeatables repeatedly as long as those are not your starting ones
 Gabbek: yeah, think that's how it works
 RockyMullet: im confused again
 Gabbek: all spells learned from tome are repeatable
 Gabbek: and worse - all of them will appear with the flag if I'm not mistaken, right?
 RockyMullet: ok so its just casting the same spell, i get it now
 Gabbek: well - you can cast any, as long as it's not a starting one :p
 Gabbek: seems like randomly saying defender of 25 works - rank #26, haha
 MarekM: hi, it just me in python, or everyone lose 33ms out of 50 just for  reading mandatory inputs?
 Gabbek: tell me about your results Rocky, if you'll try repeats
 MattSOrme: @MarekM
 MattSOrme: When are you starting your clock?
 Gabbek: MattSOrme found the merger useful, or using a single file atm?
 MattSOrme: @Gabbek single file atm. I'm going to re-format everything and start again on the weekend
 MarekM: after while True:
 Gabbek: poke me if you would need help using it, I'll be around on the weekend MattSOrme
 MattSOrme: @MarekM move it to after the first input
 Jdools05: anyone know how to open a private chat i closed on accident? I didnt have them as a friend and i dont remember the specifics of their username
 MarekM: @MattSOrme looks much better, thank You
 Jdools05: it was like Rwillson something...
 Astrobytes: use the search at the top
 Astrobytes: then message them if you recognise the right username
 LastRick: its in the top if you're not on a puzzle
 Astrobytes: ^
 Surina_Kaiba_Quinn: Hello, just unlocked chat and wanted to say hi.:relaxed:
 Gabbek: Hello BrandonRobertBerg-Mcdougald&#160;:)
 Subsage: that's a big name
 ZarthaxX: autogenerated
 ClockSort: are you allowed to pay the tax with the taxcount you collect from LEARN?
 BrunoFelthes: no
 ZarthaxX: that's given after
 ClockSort: IRS lets me do it
 Andriamanitra: i've won 9/10 clashes since i accidentally missed one and finished last... still not back to the rank i was before that
 Andriamanitra: this is brutal T_T
 zeeton_red: lol... adding random rest to clear wood1 feels so naughty. Anyway will start work on bronze tomorrow. 
 zeeton_red: good night and gl hf everyone
 Zhmyh: Anyone knows if there will be an increase of potions count for game over in the higher leagues?
 Zhmyh: I mean silver+
 Zenoscave: I had a ternary switched. was scoring all completeable brews as 0
 Zenoscave: lol
 Gabbek: ouch, good catch though!
 icecream17: just joined
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave F
 RockyMullet: nooooo timeout
 ZarthaxX: F x2
 Zenoscave: 80% of my losses are timeouts
 RockyMullet: wow all my lost are from timeout
 RockyMullet: gotta fix that
 Zhmyh: Wtf did you already do to get a timeout? xD
 Icebox: I'm already getting timeouts since an hour
 Icebox: xD
 Zenoscave: hush icebox
 Zhmyh: U mean 1 AM or T+1 since the beginning?
 Zenoscave: 1st place should never timeout
 Icebox: LET ME BE PROUD OF MY TIMEOUTS
 Icebox: PEW PEW
 Zenoscave: PEW PEW PEW PEW
 RockyMullet: ok some bugs in here lol
 RockyMullet: PEW PEW
 Icebox: Zhmyh since an hour ago*
 Icebox: forgot a word
 Zhmyh: Oh
 RockyMullet: actually my timeout is a crash, so "better?" I guess
 Zenoscave: "better" lol
 RockyMullet: stabilized 7th&#160;!
 RockyMullet: :D
 Gabbek: :D holy molly
 Hjax: wow the repeatable potions are really bugged arent they 
 Hjax: er, spells *
 Gabbek: yeah, they really are
 Icebox: repeatable potions :o
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/500023291">https://www.codingame.com/replay/500023291</a>
 Gabbek: RockyMullet I'm between 10-40 with my random heurestics
 Hjax: first turn both bots grab a non repeatable and cast it 5 times 
 Hjax: amazing 
 DomiKo: :sweat_smile:
 Gabbek: oddly enough I think it could work, atleast for now; just need to tweak some numbers
 Gabbek: getting closer to you :P
 Gabbek: I must admit - I've never felt so clueless as in this multi
 Gabbek: I have no idea what I'm doing :D
 RockyMullet: fixed my crash, time for a resubmit :triumph:
 Gabbek: oh noes, here comes #1 Rocky
 RockyMullet: I was crashing against romka sadly :P
 RockyMullet: wasnt*
 Zenoscave: RIP
 RockyMullet: damn, also have a bug where I do nothing
 kreska: Hi everybody I have a question. Can one potion consists of more than 6 ingredients or this is max because from the game visualisation it looks like there can be max 6 ingredients per potion?
 DomiKo: its max
 Gabbek: kreska 6 is the max
 kreska: thank you very much for quick answer!!
 RockyMullet: lol knowledge is power<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/500028919">https://www.codingame.com/replay/500028919</a>
 Zenoscave: Rocky how many do you win in first 30 matches?
 Gabbek: I would say about 90%
 RockyMullet: I lost twice in first 80, this game being one
 RockyMullet: I think I lock myself with a full inventory
 Gabbek: #14 here and about 10-15 loses in 75ish games, so I guess Rocky must be around 5ish
 Gabbek: oh, I was wrong :D
 RockyMullet: still losing to Romka :unamused:
 BenjaminUrquhart: looks like I need to start doing stuff
 icecream17: what only 2
 RockyMullet: ok fixed it I think, RESUBMIT&#160;!
 Zenoscave: top 200. not base for 1.5 hours
 Zenoscave: err top ~200
 RockyMullet: icebox raining on my party
 RockyMullet: hum i think my fix made it worse
 lNitsua: I've never used python before, but figured this was told this was the best time for me to learn because of the linear algebra capabilities. I just finished my bronze bot and was wondering if anyone could just look at the code and tell me if I made any python fau paux's
 lNitsua: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/ySRybCSD">https://pastebin.com/ySRybCSD</a>
 icecream17: 4 people pormotiong
 lNitsua: I'm not really asking for bot advice, just python tips/advice/mistakes I made
 lNitsua: but tips are always welcome
 RockyMullet: what&#160;???<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/500036614">https://www.codingame.com/replay/500036614</a>
 RockyMullet: my opponent timeout and then I lose&#160;?
 Gabbek: oh lol
 Gabbek: he got 2 points for having tier-1+ items in inventory
 Hjax: known bug
 Gabbek: that's even better hack than repeating spells :D
 Hjax: well im almost done formatting the inputs in a way i like 
 Hjax: maybe ill get something that runs before i go to bed lol 
 RockyMullet: 100% win in 26 games, looking good
 Hjax: what are you doing right now rocky? just some heuristics? 
 Hjax: or do you have something more fancy already?
 Waffle3z: pretty tedious to figure out what exact move the opponent made
 RockyMullet: hard to say how fancy it is
 RockyMullet: probably still in heuristic territory
 RockyMullet: 3 lost to Romka, he wants to assert dominance
 RockyMullet: 4 lost
 RockyMullet: 5, please staph
 Waffle3z: trying to keep track of that +3 bonus which means I need to know if the opponent and I both brewed the #1 potion at the same time
 AbsentMoon: Since you may play either the red or blue witch, how do I know which inventory to track?
 Hjax: your inventory is always given first
 Hjax: regardless of which witch you are
 RockyMullet: 7 lost to romka, not a single game against icebox
 Gabbek: aww
 Gabbek: you were too good :p
 Gabbek: so you ended up playing against romka all the time, hehe
 RockyMullet: icebox is scared of my beautiful mullet thats why
 RockyMullet: 9 lost against romka, still no game against icebox, not understanding how it works lol
 RockyMullet: oh no lsot to icebox in the end
 Andriamanitra: oh no i've ran into the dreaded flood fill clash
 Andriamanitra: why is this a thing ;_;
 RockyMullet: hum, im still fulling my inventory some times

 RockyMullet: laggy lol
 Gabbek: tough, feeling clueless&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: trying to have fun before people smarter than me crushs my hopes and dreams
 Chloris: lol
 RockyMullet: stabilized 6th, seems fair :D
 Chloris: 👍
 solaimanope: How do you upload java project that has multiple files into the competiton?
 Xenoid: I don't think that is possible
 BenjaminUrquhart: you put it all into 1 file
 hito: I remember a past challange had starter kits for some languages - is there a python3 starter kit this time around?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: have fun
 icecream17: somehow i'm stuck with a bug that's hard to find already
 lNitsua: is numpy capable of symbolics, or is sympy usable in this?
 Icebox: unfortunately nor
 Icebox: not*
 icecream17: my code keeps thinking that green is tier 2 and i cant figure out why
 lNitsua: my only real approach to this is linear algebra, and the only way I can think to solve with more than 4 spells is symbolically. You all are using linear algebra, right?
 icecream17: i'm still in Wood 1
 Waffle3z: I'm doing BFS
 BenjaminUrquhart: ^ just a search
 Gabbek: random
 lNitsua: that sucks to hear, I was excited for this one cause EVERY contest uses bfs
 Waffle3z: linear combination would require casting negative spells
 lNitsua: How?
 Icebox: it's funny you mention sympy lNitsua
 Waffle3z: unless you mean something other than solving a system of linear equations
 Waffle3z: actually that's not how to approach this anyway
 lNitsua: that's exactly what I mean. You can sum the affect of each spell into the neccessary amount for a potion, then solve for constants, which are casts of each spell
 Waffle3z: yeah maybe that is a better approach than bfs
 lNitsua: works fine for the first 4 spells, it would fail without symbolics after learning a new spell
 lNitsua: Icebox why?
 Icebox: I remember talking with [CG]Thibaud about improving python and what's the best way to do it at the start of 2019 and I specifically mentioned sympy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/qyH8IA8">https://imgur.com/qyH8IA8</a>
 Icebox: but either intentionally or not that addition was skipped over :D
 lNitsua: I'm much more proficient in matlab so I made a draft in it, and it gave me the appropriate amount. Now I just need to move it to python
 Waffle3z: bfs is still good for finding the shortest path, which may include a detour through LEARN
 Icebox: .
 lNitsua: tbh this challenge would be borderline broken with sympy imo
 Waffle3z: or a creative usage of some other spell that avoids a REST
 Icebox: lNitsua that is unfortunately not true
 Icebox: even with sympy, someone who reimplements the same math in C++ will just outperform your code with a factor of 100 if not more
 lNitsua: Waffle3z my first thought is that you could do a run through of the available spells and see if they're more "efficient" than the base. Including them in a linear equation should include the shortcut
 Icebox: that's why I wanted sympy added
 icecream17: aaaa it was a typo!!!!
 icecream17: YES the bug was fixed!!!
 Gabbek: congrats icecream17
 lNitsua: That's fair, as far as the coding goes I'm out of my league here. I know cpp is far faster, but I don't see any reasonable ways to include symbolics in cpp
 BenjaminUrquhart: roll your own :upside_down:
 lNitsua: or solve the equations without syms. But I'll be working on that part for the next few days I guess
 Waffle3z: something like 4 tier 0 -&gt; 1 tier 4 and 1 tier 4 -&gt; 5 tier 0 has a net gain of +1 tier 0 but still requires that you have 4 in the first place
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, typo...i shoul dhave never reached bronze
 RohanasaurusRex: You guys seem really experienced so I was just wondering what language you think I should learn next(I've already learnt Python and C). I'm thinking maybe Javascript or C++. Thanks
 Icebox: C++ unless you're a web developer
 Gabbek: whoa, my random's 17 and there's still some games left
 RohanasaurusRex: Oh thank you
 Xenoid: Those are both good choices. Java would also be a good choice
 Gabbek: going :o
 RohanasaurusRex: Yeah thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: say no to JS... java
 Icebox: say no to java... kotlin
 Waffle3z: is java better than other languages for something?
 lNitsua: I'm confused on what your example there proves, waffle3z
 Waffle3z: there are some initial conditions necessary for any given sequence of spells to be possible
 BenjaminUrquhart: Waffle3z not really other than an intermediary between python and C/C++ in terms of speed
 BenjaminUrquhart: at least imo
 lNitsua: yeah of course, but because the initial spell gives 2 for free, the math would allow it to be done
 Waffle3z: why would you want an intermediary in terms of speed, that sounds like a disadvantage
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I learned Fortran, never used it beyond academia
 Gabbek: you have to manage your inventory size 
 Gabbek: that's very important
 BenjaminUrquhart: my inventory seems to manage itself
 BenjaminUrquhart: somehow
 Gabbek: it feels like top10 is where you need repeating spells
 lNitsua: is there a cap on the number of times you can cast a repeatable spell in one turn?
 lNitsua: aside from soft limits?
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't think so
 Gabbek: nope, only inventory space is your limit
 BenjaminUrquhart: as long as you have space
 lNitsua: ty
 BenjaminUrquhart: Gabbek your bot is a spell hoarder<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/500059556">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/500059556</a>
 Gabbek: I don't have any search so it's still not really all that useful tbh :D
 Gabbek: I've just watched my losses and could've won about half of them with search&#160;:/ hmm
 dauom: how do you get promoted from league to league?For instance I'm in bronze but I don't know how to figure out when I will be promoted or what the criteria are
 BenjaminUrquhart: when you finish placement above the boss for the league
 Gabbek: silver league will unlock on 16th
 BenjaminUrquhart: right now there's no boss because the next league isn't open
 dauom: I see... that was confused me, not seeing any boss in this league
 dauom: Thanks
 Gabbek: BenjaminUrquhart just tried with 20ish spells, it's funny :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice
 Gabbek: with tons of spells you should most likely aim for very expensive potions
 Gabbek: even if someone makes potions much faster than you
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't aim for specific potions, I just search until it's possible to make one
 Gabbek: than they still can't win if you get huge rupees values from your potions

 Gabbek: haha, not good, but funny :D
 Thienu: what happens if both witches brews the same potion? do they both get the reward?
 Xenoid: Yes
 Thienu: thanks
 Xenoid: No problem

 Xenoid: Is the file size limit still 100K or did they raise it?

 NicoNeko: if you code in java how do u combine multiple class files into one
 NicoNeko: do u literally just copy and paste
 Rodrigo_the_coder: it was incomplete
 Rodrigo_the_coder: file over the limit
 DToTheE: Are we allowed to share ideas and our code with other people we are working ideas with?
 MoMaT: no code sharing @DToTheE
 DToTheE: Got it, thanks!
 SeekDog: wow
 SeekDog: fall challenge got some fun
 Meme_Magician: I have no idea what to do q_qI know this is some sort of optimization problem but the recursive method I wrote to select the best action takes too long
 NinjaDoggy: so what's up with the reusable bug people were talking about earlier? Are all spells reusable right now, even if they're not supposed to be?
 NinjaDoggy: repeatable*
 Laminator: for the bot competitions, anyone know if slower languages are at a disadvantage? Like 50 ms is brutal if we're talking C++ vs Python.

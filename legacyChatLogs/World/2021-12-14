 UZUHAMA: Is there such a thing as "Hash list"?
 UZUHAMA: Or did I just get confused over hashmaps and hashtables
 DialFrost: there is such thing as a hash list
 DialFrost: but its in java
 DialFrost: if im right
 Schwase: ok well i mistyped one character and didnt get 100% in code golf, time for me to get off
 Schwase: its been real
 DialFrost: hai schwase
 Schwase: howdy
 DialFrost: i see that ur a pro at optimization/CoC
 Schwase: uh thanks?

 DialFrost: shheeeeesh thx
 Schwase: also it took me about 10 days
 Schwase: to get to 6th
 Schwase: and i honestly cant be bothered to get to 1st
 DialFrost: lol
 Schwase: i could get like 100 or so less characters easily
 Schwase: i could get to 3rd place i think
 Schwase: but i dont want to
 Schwase: beating the creator's score is good enough for me honestly
 UZUHAMA: I can't find anything about hashlist...
 UZUHAMA: I guess it was something that's made up in my head
 Wontonimo: hash map
 Wontonimo: aka, associative array
 Wontonimo: aka dictionary
 DialFrost: hai wontonimo long time no see
 PATTRIM: hai
 PatBin: sup
 ProNoob.py: sup
 AlkhilJohn.: Wontonimo got demoted

 Overbed: i want to print the highest and lowest but first the lowest and then the highest
 Overbed: but it prints out the lowest and then under it the whole input 
 Uljahn: if i &gt; i: :scream_cat:
 Overbed: yes ik but it doesnt work when its if i &gt; input()
 derjack: oO
 Uljahn: input() returns a string btw
 Uljahn: and each time you call input() it's a new string :smirk:
 Overbed: i mean s
 Uljahn: is comparing strings really what you need?
 Overbed: idk
 Overbed: its reverse so
 Overbed: wow i just need to reverse the input i think
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: you could just make a list then add all of the input then print max(list name) min(listname)
 darkhorse64: Oui
 darkhorse64: oops
 Thorcode: how to add \ as str?
 5DN1L: \\
 Thorcode: thanks
 Overbed: why does my reversed function not work
 Overbed: message = input()for i in message:
 Kanerix: message[::-1]
 Kanerix: That's a better way to reverse a astring
 Overbed: i want to print the input from down to above and reverse

 Overbed: like this
 Kanerix: oh
 Overbed: and a space inbetween
 Kanerix: Can't you just revese message like i told you and then loop through each charand print it?
 Kanerix: message=input()[::-1]
 Kanerix: for c in message:

 LelouchVC2: where's that hexagon guy so he can ban me again?
 DialFrost: bruh
 BlaiseEbuth: Hexagon? :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: struct&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: Yea that sounds right
 DialFrost: lol
 LelouchVC2: i literally said, "Hey im not banned anymore"
 LelouchVC2: and he insta banned me LOL
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh pinged him :speak_no_evil:
 LelouchVC2: funny guy
 LelouchVC2: he'll get places
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't feed the troll hey
 LelouchVC2: yea, he's a troll with admin powers
 BlaiseEbuth: Being a troll is a prerequisite to be mod here.
 LelouchVC2: honestly
 LelouchVC2: someone made a 9/11 joke. i laughed
 LelouchVC2: i got banned and he got nothing
 BlaiseEbuth: This is a new account so&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: Me? didn't make a new account. it wasnt perma ban apparently
 BlaiseEbuth: So it was not a ban.
 BlaiseEbuth: But a kick
 BlaiseEbuth: You can come back in the minute
 LelouchVC2: it was a year i believe
 LelouchVC2: the first one
 LelouchVC2: 2nd one was a month at least
 BlaiseEbuth: Na. Only kick for a minute or definitive ban here
 LelouchVC2: maybe someone decided to unban me
 LelouchVC2: i was banned for a while
 BlaiseEbuth: Or the chat bugged... That can unban people, and mod/unmod people :p
 LelouchVC2: my sql injections must have worked!
 Thorcode: the chat was reseted by thiba I think
 LelouchVC2: ahh idk, doesn't matter i suppose
 BlaiseEbuth: The chat reset itself when coc rooms make it crash... -_-
 LelouchVC2: chat here gets toxic
 LelouchVC2: that's hilarious
 ShaneCope: Why are most of my arena matches ending in 1 round with no results and a seemingly random winner?
 ShaneCope: The ones that play I dominate but some just... dont?
 LelouchVC2: might be a bug causing both players to crash
 BlaiseEbuth: Can you share a replay&#160;?
 ShaneCope: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/596510183">https://www.codingame.com/replay/596510183</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: You programm didn't output anything.
 LelouchVC2: looks like none of ur pieces moved, so ur program might have crashed
 ShaneCope: Why would it only happen sometimes D:
 BlaiseEbuth: Can you share a replay where it works?
 LelouchVC2: could be a lot of things, like your program cant handle certain starting positions
 ShaneCope: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/596510204">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/596510204</a>
 ShaneCope: I made sure my bounds are within the board and even if I did outside my pieces would just sit at edge
 BlaiseEbuth: My guess is a problem of player id. Works when you're p1, crash when you're p2.
 ShaneCope: Didnt think it mattered, but maybe it does
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't remember the input format for cr...
 ShaneCope: It even says type 0 is one of your robots
 ShaneCope: which is what I base it on
 BlaiseEbuth: True. So perhaps it's not that...
 LelouchVC2: I had a bug in a different one where it would give me IDs of dead things
 LelouchVC2: So my program would just insta lose whenever a bot died. Couldn't participate in it anymore until they fixed the bug over 2 weeks later
 ShaneCope: Nothing starts dead tho
 LelouchVC2: tru, could be something similar. but comb through ur code and make sure u didnt screw something up
 LelouchVC2: have lots of error outputs
 ShaneCope: Looking over all the arena fights
 ShaneCope: its true that the ones I lost are the ones where I am P2
 ShaneCope: No losses of me as P1
 ShaneCope: When I flop it... it works the other way lmao
 ShaneCope: Now I need to find the condition for which player I am this is silly
 Uljahn: you click "delete" buttons below players' avatars in IDE to add them in reverse order to test it
 ShaneCope: oh nice. Thanks for that
 BlaiseEbuth: Strange. As you said and reading back the statement, the inputs seems to be independant of which player you are...
 LelouchVC2: 10 billion IQ design
 ShaneCope: I figured it out
 ShaneCope: I had been incrementing my bots via index
 ShaneCope: And when Im p2 my bots come after their bots
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah!
 ShaneCope: Just gunna save their ID I guess
 LelouchVC2: as u should. a bot class where they all have their own id
 ShaneCope: I did have that but I was inserting their update by index instead of id cause I built that before I built the object and changed my code&#160;:'D
 ShaneCope: So easy fix
 LelouchVC2: pro gaming
 LelouchVC2: progaming
 LelouchVC2: programing
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a script to improve ux in bot programming btw <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Azkellas/cgenhancer">https://github.com/Azkellas/cgenhancer</a>
 ShaneCope: fancy
 BlaiseEbuth: With a 'swap' button :p
 derjack: and crypto mining in background
 ShaneCope: A crypto miner would be extremely upset if they tried to use this PC
 ShaneCope: IIRC the video card in this old desktop is a... GTX 640?
 derjack: not if there are 1000s of them
 ShaneCope: I think even then
 derjack: all the moneys collected go to raises for the mods
 LelouchVC2: where do i apply to become president?
 LelouchVC2: I will make an executive order to ban all mods
 LelouchVC2: then i will become a mod
 derjack: #fr
 ShaneCope: this is tons better now I am not ranked awful haha
 ShaneCope: Rank 1 woot
 Uljahn: low leagues are tutorial
 ShaneCope: Nah man league 1 is the true master class obvs

 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. If someone help me out. I am thinking how to overload the operator [][] in C++. Is there any way?

 Manchi_o6o7: not only [ ], but [ ] [ ]
 LelouchVC2: you can't directly do that
 LelouchVC2: i can think of a few ways that you can kinda do that, but depends on ur situation
 Manchi_o6o7: can you give me a clue
 LelouchVC2: this has some interesting answers you can look through regarding this
 LelouchVC2: such as an overloaded function calling another:

 Thorcode: hello, could anyone help me to learn code? I'm kinda new, which site should I learn? pls help me. thanks guy alot
 Uljahn: :rolling_eyes:
 Thorcode: wdym Ulja?
 Thorcode: pls super-duper cat pls help me
 Thorcode: I mean for ruby I could not find any site to learn that code
 Uljahn: start with learning how to search then
 Uljahn: that's the most important skill
 Thorcode: Thanks ulja I finaally find a good site to learn
 Thorcode: it seem that learning ruby is harder tahn python
 Westicles: beginning to think this chat should be discontinued
 Uljahn: agreed
 Thorcode: agreed
 Westicles: it was nice before all the bot guys left
 Thorcode: I'm learning
 darkhorse64: The issue is not with the chat
 Thorcode:&#160;? wdym
 darkhorse64: It's a content/communication problem. Regular bot guys like to discuss about  bot programming while CG focus shifts to something else 
 Thorcode: I understood. 
 xxXUltaSpiritus_L1ghtS4suk3Xxx: i do like lasagna

 TheModified: is it ever possible to see the tests ran on your code in ClashOfCode?
 Pretzel7g: you can just print the input
 Pretzel7g: it will automatically invalidate the test, but at least you can see what you're dealing with
 handrianina: or just error log
 derjack: there are test cases visible, but not validators
 derjack: adn you can print to error without breaking the code
 Pretzel7g: or you can print to stderr (in python print(x,file=sys.stderr)) and it will be omitted in the test

 murata: yall im new to this shi im so confused.
 5DN1L: If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. We'll try to answer
 murata: Okay ill try to explain the best I can. SO im coding with Javascript and im doing Code breaker Puzzle and im pretty lost on what to do. I completed the first Test case but I dont know how to do the second one.
 5DN1L: murata, there can be other values involved, you have to test them one by one until you find the correct one for each case

 jacek: tutorial for the first league, then when you pass you can write anything
 Makea84: Mad Pod Racing is awesome
 Nandita: I am in first league
 Makea84: im in silver league

 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 struct: I think you only need to replace output
 struct: on first leaguew
 jacek: destinationY destinationY to XY
 Nandita: but how to calculate to change the output
 Makea84: First of all you have to check the tutorial
 Nandita:  float angle = atan2(next_checkpoint_y-y, next_checkpoint_x-x) * 180 / 3.141;
 Uljahn: just correct the mistake, don't write anything else
 Nandita: I am trying this
 jacek: you are given the angle
 Nandita: hmm
 struct: you are given the angle on the next league
 struct: just follow the tutorial :p
 jacek: overthinking eh
 Makea84: Yes, you already have the angle
 struct: not on the first league only from the 2nd and so on
 codergautam: hi
 Nandita: in the Inputs
 Nandita:&#160;?
 struct: on the next league you will have the angle
 struct: but you need to complete the first part of the tutorial
 Makea84: Can you share the code? cause i dont remember the code on that league
 Nandita: yes

 jacek: nad i believe this is crystal rush graphics?
 Hjax: that site has been dead for years, makes me happy to see the game given new life here 
 Hjax: i should submit something
 Hjax: i still have my old code somewhere, as well as the code of a few other top competitors on that site 
 Hjax: iirc the strongest robotgame bot used simulated annealing to optimize against a set of open source bots 
 Hjax: one of the targets was one of mine 
 Hjax: the game isnt an exact replica, the map shape is different, and robot games map didnt wrap around 
 jacek: did they get random inputs?
 jacek: i wonder if top players try to make a whole map of the arena
 Hjax: what do you mean?
 jacek: did you play clash of bots?
 Hjax: not yet, i just learned about it 10 minutes ago
 Hjax: i played robotgame about a decade ago
 jacek: ahh. well each robot has 5x5 vision. and you get randomized visions, so you dont know the whole map
 Hjax: ah, robotgame was perfect information 
 struct: oh no
 struct: multi agent with fog o.o
 jacek: but im not sure if perfect information is needed at this level
 Hjax: seems like theres quite a few new bot programming games here

 Sideway: &gt;PHYSICS&#160;: "am i joke to you&#160;??"
 Sideway: struggling on mars lander&#160;:'(
 LelouchVC2: Dont worry, even people with PhDs have crashed their landers
 Sideway: can't get the kinematics right, although it seems right on paper&#160;:/ ^^'
 Wontonimo: ah, mars lander... i love that series
 Wontonimo: anyone want help on it?
 Sideway: i do like the animations :c
 Sideway: eventhough i'm at stage 1 &lt;3
 Wontonimo: mars 1&#160;?
 Sideway: yes&#160;:')
 Wontonimo: that's cool.  what have you tried so far?
 Sideway: hmm to make it simple
 Sideway: 1) Given my entry parameters, determine the min and max power to stay within the speed range
 Sideway: 2) Then pick the right amount of power given my position from ground
 Wontonimo: let's just stick with num 1.  how have you translated that into code?
 Sideway: min_power = ceil( GRAVITY + (-MAX_VSPEED - v_speed)/TIME_BASE );
 Wontonimo: what's time base?
 Sideway: 1 (for 1 second)
 Wontonimo: right
 Wontonimo: it'll always be 1 sec for all 3 episodes, so you can simplify that 
 Sideway: right after that i check if my min_power is &lt; 0, if so i set it to 0
 Sideway: and i do something similar for my max_power
 Wontonimo: how about something simpler, like, if going down faster than you want, use full thrust
 Wontonimo: else dont
 Wontonimo: how fast are you allowed to descend onto the landing platform?
 Sideway: hmm wouldn't that be fuel consuming&#160;?
 Sideway: (even if i don't need to bother about fuel yet though..)
 Wontonimo: no need to overengineer a solution if something simple works great
 Sideway: i am asked to land with 40 m/s at most
 Wontonimo: okay, so... let's say -30m/s on the safe side
 pmor: suicide burns are generally more efficient
 Wontonimo: this will be nearly a suicide burn 
 Wontonimo: *nearly*
 pmor: gotta add in that fudge&#160;:)
 Sideway: if i remember well, real-life boosters apply a huge burst just before landing
 LelouchVC2: I nearly jumped off a bridge
 Wontonimo: that's a suicide burn as pmor said
 Sideway: then they adjust their thrust with smaller engines
 LelouchVC2: Didn't produce quite as much momentum as jumping
 Wontonimo: so, back to a really good (but not perfect) first implementation,
 Wontonimo: use full thrust if descending more than a crash speed, otherwise don't use much thrust at all
 Sideway: i'm trying that
 Wontonimo: here's kinda what it will look like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/596692146">https://www.codingame.com/replay/596692146</a>
 Sideway: aaaa i want to see my animation before being spoiled&#160;;')

 pmor: :D
 Sideway: wow that explosion scared me so much
 Sideway: @Wontonimo your solution seems to work, i just need to apply a smaller max_speed
 Sideway: *to my code
 Wontonimo: and here is a straight average of 3.5 thrust as reference of how INEFFICIENT constant thrust is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/596692437">https://www.codingame.com/replay/596692437</a>

 Wontonimo: 238 litres of fuel left&#160;!  great job
 Sideway: MAX_VHSPEED 30 for this test, and still approaching the 38 m/s
 Sideway: VSPEED*
 Sideway: as you said before, i was overthinking my problem
 Wontonimo: to really do the suicide thrust thing to the max, what you can do is account for the fact that your max thrust is more than gravity (but just by a little)
 Sideway: basically i was going into dark differential equations... for nothing in the end ^^
 SiltheringPython: hewo
 Sideway: hey
 Wontonimo: that means you can actually fall at a speed greater than your max landing speed so long as you have distance enough to lower your speed
 e_fishel: hello
 Sideway: what i should test then, is estimate the current time before reaching ground, and how much vertical speed i can regain before hitting the ground
 Sideway: since, as you said, if i go full throttle i can reduce my speed before hitting the ground ^^
 Sideway: so at each second i could set up a bool "Can i still recover if i go full throttle", or sthing like that
 Wontonimo: i just used a physics equation because i know it.  V^2 = 2aS + Vo^2 and solve.  but you can also do this as a simulation and just playout different scenarios 
 Sideway: oh i do know that one ^^
 Wontonimo: yeah, your boolean idea is a good one
 Sideway: if i remember well, time doesnt interfere in your equation, since you have a constant acceleration
 C26_1: So V = sqrt(2aS + Vo^2)&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yeah.  but I solved for S not V.  S gives me my safe distance.  if the ground is closer than S, i'm dead
 e_fishel: x_x
 Wontonimo: one of the V's is current speed.  one of the V's is max landing speed
 Wontonimo: hey e_fishel, what are you working on?
 e_fishel: there is no spoon - episode 1
 Wontonimo: there really isn't a spoon
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 e_fishel: i'm making a grid that has the distance to the nearest node to the right
 C26_1: S = (V^2 - Vo^2)/(2a) 
 C26_1: UZUHAMA, hello world
 UZUHAMA:&#160;:))
 Sideway: bool AmIDeadSoFar(int y_curr, int y_ground, int v_speed)
 Sideway: how about that one&#160;:')
 Wontonimo: excellent!  It's bound to work because the name is very meaningful
 e_fishel: :rofl:
 DialFrost: morning &lt;33
 Sideway: "DialFrost 01:23AMmorning &lt;33"
 Sideway: morning too :D
 DialFrost: lol its 8:23am here
 C26_1: its 7:25 AM here
 UZUHAMA: Wontonimo, is there such a thing as "hashlist"?
 Wontonimo: not that i'm aware of.  that is what you called it when we first talked about hashmaps 
 UZUHAMA: Idk why I remember that name
 e_fishel: is a hashmap the same as a javascript new Map()&#160;?
 UZUHAMA: I have no idea
 UZUHAMA: I heard somebody saying hashlist only exists in Java
 UZUHAMA: After that I'm even more confused
 pmor: hashlist? a list of hashes? or a hash of lists?
 UZUHAMA: A list of hashes, 
 pmor: though hashmaps are usually implemented by using lists for their buckets
 UZUHAMA: Ok I have to do some research about this
 pmor: In my experience, 95% of the time you would use a vector over a list
 UZUHAMA: Vector is a flexible list, right?
 pmor:  vector is a resizable array
 UZUHAMA: I mean array, yeah
 Wontonimo: e_fishel, a hashmap is the same as an associative array in javascript
 Wontonimo: in my experience noone uses vectors
 pmor: really?  we use it all the time in game dev
 Wontonimo: in what language?
 pmor: c++
 Wontonimo: ah!  i don't c++, so that explains it.  i thought you were talking about java
 Wontonimo: i bet vectors are implemented well in c++.  in java they are garbage
 pmor: ah, nope.  Not too familiar with java.
 Wontonimo: have you gotten much into data-driven-design with game dev c++?
 pmor: its an allocated array that has element tracking.  
 pmor: yeah, its critical
 Wontonimo: cool
 UZUHAMA: I can't understand you guys' ancient language
 UZUHAMA: sad
 pmor: 'modern' c++&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: i've hardly done any other than here.  work for me is financial systems and so it is inheritance hell
 pmor: cobol?
 Wontonimo: because they all think they know OOP but actually they hard code everything to the implementation, so it is COP (class oriented programming)
 Wontonimo: java&#160;!  
 Wontonimo: perhaps the architects used to be cobol programmers
 pmor: I took a class on cobol when i was in school.  It was not something i really enjoyed
 Wontonimo: what kinds of development practices help maintain a longer lived data-driven-project?  Like, once you've exceeded 100k lines and it's more than 2 years old&#160;?
 struct: some people dont use vector a lot on cg
 Wontonimo: is it just the usual unit tests&#160;?
 struct: its good if you allocate all the memory needed though
 Wontonimo: pair programming , integration tests?
 pmor: try several million lines and &gt;10 yrs old
 Wontonimo: even better, how do you keep cost of ownership down?
 struct: some people dovector&lt;Node&gt; nodes(10'000'000);
 struct: which is fine
 pmor: struct - check out polymorphic allocators
 pmor: we have some unit tests.  spend a lot of time design.  we have a lot of automated testing
 Wontonimo: there is this whole movement to 'micro services' which is supposed to address some of the concerns of maintaining and replacing parts of these larger financial systems.  it add a lot of cost of communication between parts, but it buckets problems so they can be worked on in isolation 
 Wontonimo: is there something like that for data driven design, or some other business driven solution of the day that you are seeing trending?
 pmor: those are two different things
 pmor: microservices are a way to really enforce designing your interfaces between systems
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'm telling you something i'm seeing in my world.  i'm wonder what is trending in your world
 Wontonimo: it's certainly NOT micro services
 pmor: data driven design determines how you structure your data and code to take advantage of the hardware
 e_fishel: so
 e_fishel: is a map an associative array?
 Wontonimo: yes
 pmor: microservices are used in anything that is web-based.  We have a few tools that run like that
 Wontonimo: ah, so probably something that is a much larger topic in your world is hardware
 pmor: otherwise the game itself is a pretty big monolithic beast
 Wontonimo: and compatability
 ZXC01: Hi
 pmor: yeah. we try to abstract away the hardware as much as we can.  That's why engines are so popular
 pmor: unreal, frostbite, crytek, tec
 pmor: ^etc
 pmor: but data driven design is really about taking advantage of memory access patterns
 pmor: so if youre ripping through data processing it in some way, you want that data, and only that data, to be in an array or vector
 struct: how do you take advantage of it?
 struct: you want it to be next to each other?
 pmor: exactly, because then the cpu can prefetch it into the l3, l2 &amp; l1 caches
 Wontonimo: struct, your code is data-driven-design in UTTT and C4 (and others i'm guessing)
 struct: I dont do anything special
 Wontonimo: but you are&#160;;)
 pmor: for example, check out this snippet
 pmor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9b0051ca-c36c-4e49-8154-2fc38b760501">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9b0051ca-c36c-4e49-8154-2fc38b760501</a>
 pmor: the second struct is a basic example of data driven design
 struct: so 2nd should be better?
 Wontonimo: if you want to process all a's at once
 struct: ah
 Wontonimo: or all c's at once
 struct: of
 pmor: if you operate on all individual members at a time
 pmor: yeah
 struct: but if I want to process element 0 of a,b,c the 1st one should be the one to go right?
 pmor: correct
 pmor: its determined by how you access your data
 pmor: but you try to access it in a way that you are ONLY accessing the data you need right then
 Wontonimo: you already do that struct.  if you don't and you are killing me in c4 and uttt i'll do something rash which i'll regret
 struct: well the rollouts ammount is probably the difference
 Wontonimo: hey e_fishel, how is the spoon coming along?
 pmor: The second thing about data driven design that I see on CG a lot is shrinking down the size of your structs as much as possible 
 e_fishel: i succesfully made a 2d array for both axis
 pmor: because then you end up with less cache misses
 pmor: since more structs can fit into a cache line
 e_fishel: now i only need to go through every position and check it's position in the array
 pmor: essentially , L1 is 10x faster than L2, which is 10x faster than L3, which is 100x faster than main memory
 pmor: so having cache friendly code is very important for performance
 struct: yeap usually my mcts nodes are 16 bytes
 pmor: thats crazy small
 Wontonimo: yeah, like i said, you are already doing it struct.  and you say you are not doing 'anything special' but if you look at your ranking you can tell it is "pretty special"
 pmor: trees are not good for cache performance so having really small nodes helps
 struct: the avx of checkwin and getwinningmoves also help
 struct: yeah mcts is not cache friendly at all
 struct: the most cache friendly algo I used here was beamsearch
 Wontonimo: that's an interesting point
 struct: where I just switched back and forth between 2 arrays that would fit in L2(?) cache
 pmor: well, like i said...if you're iterating through an array a cpu can detect that and prefetch a cache line 
 pmor: so it may not exactly fit, but you won't see much loss of performance because the cpu has your back
 e_fishel: it's falling apart x_x
 pmor: Im good at writing fast code, but my AI skills are noob&#160;:\
 struct: which games are you interested in pmor?
 pmor: right now Im working on a company specific challenge that CG is hosting
 struct: I see an hackathlon
 pmor: yup...i can tell its based off of the witches brew challenege
 pmor: but they changed a few things that make simming it harder
 struct: Well I did use beam search on that one
 pmor: That's what I'm trying here
 pmor: I can get ~160k sims in 30ms
 pmor: though I have a bug somewhere that's causing my bot to do stupid things
 ShandonM: Pass the boof
 struct: Do you sim both you and opponent?
 pmor: yeah, though I'm not 100% sure that's working yet
 ZXC01: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: so i guess that's what i plan to do that
 ZXC01: ...
 pmor: I think my issue is due to the possibility that a player can play multiple turns in some cases
 pmor: so the beamsearch would then have states where p0 played and some states wehre p1 played
 struct: multiple turns without the other player playing?
 pmor: yeah
 struct: you should check maybe the previous contest postmortems 
 struct: we used "synced" beam search
 pmor: you can get these bonuses.  If you use the bonus, your turn doesn't end
 pmor: yup, I've scoured through all of them
 pmor: Im currently restructuring everything so that it's 'synced'
 struct: ah ok
 pmor: basically, i bundle up all those actions and pass it to the sim
 pmor: i then sim both p1 and p2
 pmor: so the ending state is the end of turn for both p1 and p2
 pmor: I *think* that's what my problem was
 struct: sounds about right
 pmor: but i'm an ai noob, so i'm stumbling around&#160;:)
 e_fishel: it hadn't fallen apart
 e_fishel: i'm just super dumb
 e_fishel: i was doing [x][y]
 e_fishel: when in reality, it is [y][x]
 ZXC01: hi Automaton2000NN
 Automaton2000: i want to know if there is no such thing
 ZXC01: hi AutomatonNN
 e_fishel: YESS
 e_fishel: there was no spoon, but it's solved
 Mortis_666: Automaton2000 hi
 Automaton2000: kiwibleu what u mean by that
 ZXC01: lol
 Mortis_666: lol
 ZXC01: wheres automatonNN?
 ZXC01: Automaton20000000000000000000000000000000000
 Automaton2000: but i can't find you
 Wontonimo: congratulations e_fishel&#160;!! :tada::tada::tada:
 e_fishel: i'm working on the weekly puzzle
 e_fishel: 🤔
 e_fishel: i guess i'll implement some sort of spreading algorithm, not quite sure yet
 VisionaryM: Best Engine to built a game using c++
 Wontonimo: compiler 
 e_fishel: *discord*
 e_fishel: i'm kidding
 Wontonimo: i'm not wrong
 pmor: i agree.  If youre new, go small
 e_fishel: YO
 e_fishel: i did a thing
 Wontonimo: what did you do e_fishel&#160;?
 codergautam: ruby people are insanely fast wtf
 ZXC01: not really
 ZXC01: they are just short 
 Mortis_666: ya
 VisionaryM: yes you're right
 e_fishel: it works but then it doesn't
 e_fishel: it tries to access it at an index that is not in the array
 e_fishel: but i'm overcoming it with optional chaining
 e_fishel: yes!
 e_fishel: optional chaining does the trick
 e_fishel: instead of calling it foo[bar]
 e_fishel: you call it foo?.[bar]
 e_fishel: and it doesn't throw an error if it is null, undefined or void
 e_fishel: ☺☺☺☺
 e_fishel: basically, i got it working
 DialFrost: anyone willing to help me in mean max
 Wontonimo: double yeah e_fishel
 e_fishel: have you solved this week's problem?
 e_fishel: i'm in the process of doing so
 DialFrost: guys how i find dist between 2 pts
 e_fishel: straight line?
 DialFrost: cuz in mean max my functin isnt working
 e_fishel: in a 2d space?
 DialFrost: ye
 DialFrost: mean max
 DialFrost: def distance(x1,x2,y1,y2):
 DialFrost: is this corrcet
 e_fishel: that looks right to me
 e_fishel: assuming it's python
 DialFrost: but my code isnt running right
 e_fishel: wait
 DialFrost: yes its python
 e_fishel: take the absolute value of the subtractions
 DialFrost: k lemme try
 e_fishel: both x as well as y
 DialFrost: er are u free to look at my code for mean max
 DialFrost: its fine if u dont want
 e_fishel: sure
 Dren: distance between coordinates
 e_fishel: i don't know python but meh
 Dren: is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 +(y2-y1)^2)
 Dren: probably
 qpi: ** instead of ^
 struct: his math.hypot should work though
 DialFrost: i made my bot to use to grenade when the dist &lt;=1000 using the math.hypot but it never shoots
 DialFrost: mean max bot progamming btw
 struct: is it calculating the distance correctly?
 ProNoob.py: sup
 ProNoob.py: how is everyone?
 struct: hi

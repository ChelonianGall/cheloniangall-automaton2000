 jacek: yinsh puzzle of the week! how? it has no leagues
 programming123kid: hi guys i m new
 FloatingQueen: hey
 FloatingQueen: I have question, what would be the shortest way to 'output input**2' in ruby
 gigolo: haha
 FloatingQueen: p gets.to_i**2 is there any shorter way )
 jrke: nope not any more shorter according to me
 SwagLord99: why am i gae?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 come up with a joke for me i'm tired
 Automaton2000: i need to pick it up and then i get a working bot
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 use some play on words around things like - daye or saye
 Automaton2000: i wouldn't be surprised if it was a mistake
 MadKnight: a play on words is never a mistake Automaton2000 how could u think that&#160;?
 Automaton2000: maybe i'm just too lazy to fix it
 Tiramon: oh comepn Automaton2000 don't be lazy
 Automaton2000: they should have some kind of minimax
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: hello
 Tiramon: hello TheFakePencilCase_fd0b =)
 Tiramon: damn my chat is laggy ...
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: What did you lads do for the Thor challenge with the light??
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: I don't want the answer outright
 Tiramon: you just have to choose which way to walk in the knowledge of your current position and the position of the light ... hard to tell more without spoilering&#160;;)
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: Fair enough
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: my issue is you don't get current pos so far as I've seen
 Tiramon: oh common problem don't forget that you have to keep track of your current position yourself, because the task only gives you start and target position and no updates in between
 0H7l_ubinzzang: How can I play Coding Escape?
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: I think I might be getting caught up in the fact that it's labelled easy, lol
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: i keep thinking that I might be overthinking it
 KiwiTae: Tiramon o/
 Tiramon: havn't tried it yet, but you can request access at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/">https://escape.codingame.com/</a> .. no idea what happens after that 0H7l_ubinzzang
 Tiramon: Hi Kiwi
 jacek: good morning
 Tiramon: Thor is pretty easy TheFakePencilCase_fd0b so there is a good chance you are overthinking it
 Tiramon: as i said main problem most people have is that you have to keep track of the current position yourself
 KiwiTae: took me 90min for the easy room &gt;&lt;
 Tiramon: if thor keeps going always in the same direction you propably haven't updated your location
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: How would you keep track of his current pos, you know theoretically if someone else might possibly be wondering
 Tiramon: my start position is given so if i move west once my current position will be y = starty and x = startx-1
 Tiramon: also thor is also one of the few puzzles that has a 'hint' entry in the left menu which even contains pseudo code
 Tiramon: oh and a working solution
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: Man, you'd think almost half a year in Java developement classes would help figuring out a basic problem lol
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: Is this room not on discord client?
 jacek: this is not discord
 jacek: nor celestia
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: wait
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: what
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: I legit thought this was like, an integrated discord thing
 jacek: this is xmpp chat
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: lmfao, that explains why discord didn't pop up in noscript
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: I thought it was one of those fake chat bots at first
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: sort of fell apart when Tiramon was both super helpful and also very specific to my questions
 jacek: he's helpful, how could he!?&#160;:(
 Tiramon: sorry for beeing helpful&#160;;) an no our chat bot is Automaton2000 ... and i promise he is much less helpfull&#160;;)
 Automaton2000: are you doing right now
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: Lol, thanks Tiramon, making me think Skynet was taking over
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: Am I stuck with FakePncilCase or can I change it?
 TheFakePencilCase_fd0b: As much as I loove my current name it'd be nice to know how to change it
 Tiramon: pff thats quite some time ago ... i think you should be able to change it in your profile ...
 Tiramon: yes open your profile and then you should be able to click the 'Anonymous' part and change your name
 Tiramon: might take a refresh of the site before the chat recognizes your new nick
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: testing
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: aight imma refresh
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: testing #2
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: nvm
 Tiramon: FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon] it did work&#160;;)
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: lol, Yay
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: what do you think of my name choice? :smile:
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Also, what time zone are you dudes in, it's 3 am for me, but it's saying it's 8am in chat
 DrQuarius: My chess puzzle needs 2 approvals today if anyone feels like testing it?
 DrQuarius: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/64639cca3e17692ab77efb473c2f3dc784f9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/64639cca3e17692ab77efb473c2f3dc784f9</a>
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: How does one test puzzles?
 DrQuarius: The link above. Or "Community&gt;Contributions" for other puzzles.
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Sorry, I'm fairly new to using this site, my question was more of a, what do I need to do to properly test the puzzle
 jacek: test in ide. but you need 20+ lvl to approve
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Ok, so is it just making sure it's actually solvable?
 jacek: yes
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: thanks jacek
 gilufin: how do you suggest to learn ruby.I know some languages
 struct: yinsh potw :p
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: is submiting enough to 'solve' it?
 struct: rip just saw discord message
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: night yall, I'm tired and drunk not gonna figure out any problems tonigh lmfao
 Passifi: sigh this greedy tower thing is kicking my buttox everytime i have a new idea some other test case breaks :weary:
 jacek: youre so greedy
 Tiramon: pff just found a sql that is not using indizes on production and was 100 times slower that way ... was working fine on test&#160;;) 
 dreadylein: eh indexing is overvalued :P 
 gigolo: hey vro 
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 cmon
 Automaton2000: i'm going to take a look at the replays
 Tiramon: i can't believe that it will help in your case Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah i should do it
 ReaListik: hey türk hok mu&#160;?
 aTHauF: Hello&#160;:)
 gigolo:  Automaton2000 are u busy&#160;?
 Automaton2000: time to get out of silver
 euph0ria: why? silver is just getting started, waiting for $200
 gigolo: Automaton2000 :nerd:
 Automaton2000: not sure if i can reach legend
 gigolo: silver is enuf for u :joy:
 Kitkat260: can u tell alex-1 to answer me plz
 Tiramon: there is no alex-1 ... so no 
 Kitkat260: ok
 Hashtagholden: oh, mod is in chat, nice
 Tiramon: oh rhere is one ...
 Tiramon: *there
 Tiramon: leaderboard was just loading slow .. so alex-1 answer to Kitkat260 for whatever reason ... if you like to ...
 Tiramon: Hashtagholden there is a new contest upcoming ... so there will be some more activity in the chatatleast in theory
 Kitkat260: nice
 Tiramon: why should he answer?
 Tiramon: and why couldn't you tell him yourself?
 Coder_prabhat: hey Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but if you didn't see that
 Tiramon: sorry Automaton2000 that i didn't see it ... what exactly?
 Automaton2000: i had a ton of games
 gigolo: Automaton2000 which game
 Automaton2000: i'll see if i remember correctly
 Westicles: he would answer if he could, but he can't
 gigolo: :disappointed_relieved:
 Kitkat260: found him!!!
 gigolo: Automaton2000 do u like music :nerd:
 Automaton2000: how do i know if i can make it work
 gigolo: :relaxed:

 Michael_Howard: Yeah
 struct: Are you on the CG server?
 Michael_Howard: Yeah
 struct: whisper GC thibaud
 jacek: garbage collector thibaud?
 struct: CG sorry

 Tiramon: no just proxy thibaud
 Kitkat260: has anyone seen gigolo
 Michael_Howard: @struct thanks, done.
 jacek: what was that crucial bug eh :thinking:
 Michael_Howard: Nothing that would have affected you&#160;:)
 ITheseus: But sudo reboot just in case&#160;:)
 Westicles: checks 13yo daughter's chat log, turns out she is talking to gigolos
 TheNightFury: fudu bots\
 TobiasA: i finally reached level 9:sunglasses:
 KalamariKing: Nice!
 KiwiTae: gg
 TobiasA: bow before me
 TobiasA: jk
 <b>**Dr-D bows.</b></p><p><img src="/a/62856860719935" /> KalamariKing: I recently went from 9 to 13 pretty much overnight, grinding challenges
 TobiasA: yea thats right
 TobiasA: i earned it
 TobiasA: waaaat
 TobiasA: 9 to 13?
 TobiasA: there goes my pride and ego:unamused:
 Dr-D: Just show him, you can go to 14 until tomorrow!
 Dr-D: I belief in you, master!
 TobiasA: can i really tho?
 TobiasA: it took almost a year to go from 8 to 9
 TobiasA: i give up easily you know
 Dr-D: What did you do?&#160;;-&gt;
 Dr-D: Just find a puzzle that gives more than 50 exp
 Dr-D: (and solve it ..)
 KiwiTae: like bot programming
 TobiasA: when i get stuck in one of them puzzle i get frustrated and then procrastinate for like 6 months
 jacek: its so easy to level now since the quest map
 Dr-D: I came back here on saturday last week
 KiwiTae: TobiasA clash of codes doesnt give u xp
 TobiasA: ok challenge accepted
 KalamariKing: On the home screen thing, there are the challenge paths. I completed all of them except one in the middle, so as soon as I completed that one in the middle of the path, the rest were already done and I reaped all of the xp at once
 TobiasA: i'll get to 14
 KalamariKing: If that makes any sense whatsoever
 Dr-D: Just to learn all my old solutions are worthless, because I only write dart here and they seem to have updated the language 
 TobiasA: yea i found out coc doesnt give xp
 KalamariKing: I mean I completed all of the challenges on a single path, except  one
 KalamariKing: Yeah unfortunate
 TobiasA: someone should suggest a puzzle for me to level up
 TobiasA: 3 million fold
 Dr-D: Gogo TobiasA!
 KiwiTae: mars lander 1
 TobiasA: i've done that one
 Astrobytes: Space Maze
 Dr-D: That is not one of the easiest&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Nintendo
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 TobiasA: lemme check them out
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes o/
 Astrobytes: No lol
 jacek: sponsored puzzle. you can farm languages
 VizGhar: Astro? u want to kill him?
 Dr-D: Dont do that
 KiwiTae: TobiasA don't do it
 Astrobytes: Hey Kiwi o/
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: TobiasA don't
 Astrobytes: do as jacek suggested though
 Dr-D: Astro seems to like watch people burn
 Dr-D: seems to like TO watch? hmm
 jacek: or do the puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: Nah, just a standard answer for requests for easy things to do :P
 Astrobytes: lol Yinsh. Wut
 TobiasA: why not?
 KiwiTae: TobiasA do coder strike back -PIvel
 VizGhar: Puzzle of the week gives more XP or something?
 TobiasA: coder strike back is the one that broke me
 Astrobytes: What league?
 TobiasA: i still have nightmares
 jacek: nah, just quest in questmap
 TobiasA: i'm still in wood
 Dr-D: Just quest ist questmap? Like "do 100 achievments"? =D
 KiwiTae: TobiasA don't they write how to beat thewood bosses in the hints lol
 KalamariKing: Should I try the Nintendo sponsored puzzle: yay or nay
 TobiasA: i just keep losing
 TobiasA: i'm in the stage where there are collisions
 KalamariKing: Me too
 KiwiTae: start thinking about collision in gold
 VizGhar: KalamariKing solve all hard puzzle first&#160;:)
 VizGhar: nintendo is probably hardest puzzle here
 KalamariKing: VizGhar ik
 KalamariKing: thats the point
 TobiasA: so any idea how i complete coders strike back
 VizGhar: There is no fun involved in nintendo puzzle. Maybe just a huge relief after solving (haven't been there)
 Dr-D: When coding a bot, do the "kiss"-strategy: keep it simple stupid!
 VizGhar: agree with doctor
 TobiasA: but
 TobiasA: but stupid never wins
 TobiasA: if not i would win everytime
 Dr-D: than its too stupid&#160;;)
 VizGhar: get out of wood then start to think
 Dr-D: usually the first tiers can be beaten with some sort of "gready" mechanism
 Astrobytes: Nintendo is ridiculously difficult unless you're skilled in that area of mathematics. Which most of us aren't.
 TobiasA: wait no i am in bronze
 VizGhar: Which area is that Astro? :P
 TobiasA: i actually forgot
 Dr-D: =D
 ahmet_karadogan: guys the code i play is not the same with the code i test in arena what might be the problem
 Astrobytes: Field theory, cryptography
 TobiasA: so how to get out of bronze
 Astrobytes: -3vel
 TobiasA: hm?
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes Nintendo is cryptography? I should check it out 
 VizGhar: omg are we going to explain velocity like last time? :D
 TobiasA: pls do
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a beast though KiwiTae, you have been warned :D
 Astrobytes: I'm leaving before the velocity discussion VizGhar :D
 TobiasA: noooooooooooooooooo
 VizGhar: understandable... I won't contribute too
 fvla: Velocity discussion?
 KiwiTae: next frame the pod will be at its current location + dt* velocity
 Westicles: Take a jerk and integrate him twice
 fvla: lol
 VizGhar: Kiwi... you can find solutions for nintendo online as well as deep explanations :D I've checked them, they work. But I want to solve it myself later
 Westicles: Try freecell, that is more fun
 TobiasA: so how do i make the pod win
 TobiasA: win()
 KalamariKing: by doing so
 TobiasA: def win()
 TobiasA: void win(){}
 KiwiTae: target - 3vel
 TobiasA: 3vel
 TobiasA: whats that
 KiwiTae: delta position
 TobiasA: 3 velocity
 jacek: velocity
 VizGhar: here we go... by chat
 Dr-D: if you want to solve a really fun optimization game, search for "cgfunge prime" 
 TobiasA: what is the formula to get this target velocity
 fvla: yes
 TheNightFury: hellow
 TheNightFury:&#160;:)
 TobiasA: hey new person
 KalamariKing: Howdy
 TobiasA: do you know how to make me win
 KiwiTae: TobiasA google how to compute velocity
 KalamariKing: Welcome to... *advanced bot programmers trying to explain something to us newbies*
 KiwiTae: thats more like physics
 jacek: :unamused:
 TobiasA: velocity is distance/time
 TobiasA: innit?
 Westicles: Oktoberfest canceled again.  What a bunch of pansies
 jacek: hint: use muzero. make NN figure out the physics instead [solved]
 Philbot: it's not october
 Dr-D: You have to understand, those bots are usually made during a contest. People are coding a week (or so) lots (!) of hours to come up with smart ideas. That is nothing to do within 2 hours or so. 
 KalamariKing: Right but
 KalamariKing: We're looking to get out of wood
 TobiasA: i'm in bronze
 KalamariKing: Whatever, bronze
 TobiasA: i just found out
 KalamariKing: The collisions level
 TobiasA: yes that one
 Philbot: yes
 KiwiTae: before thinking about collision
 KiwiTae: you better understand the concept of velocity
 Dr-D: Take part in the upcoming spring challenge and you will understand&#160;;)
 TobiasA: i registered
 Philbot: understand what?
 TobiasA: but i'm still a noob
 Dr-D: (wont help with your velocity problem)
 TobiasA: so i want to level up
 fvla: maybe take a calculus/physics class if you want to understand velocity?
 Philbot: you know the game already dr-di&#160;?
 TobiasA: i understand velocity
 Dr-D: What? No @ Philbot
 Dr-D: Didnt even registered yet
 Philbot: yet you talk with so much confidence about it
 Dr-D: But one should do such a challenge to understand the beauty of it and the amount of work going into bots
 Dr-D: Thats nothing with the upcoming one in particular
 Westicles: You get tortoro to climb the camphor tree by collecting blueberry spirits so you can buy cards that convert into acorns
 TobiasA: i'm trying to know what the problem is that i am supposed to solve in coders strike back
 TobiasA: not how to solve the problem
 Philbot: there is a description
 TobiasA: no i mean like what did i do wrong that is making my pod not win
 TobiasA: it goes round the course
 TobiasA: but thats it
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 struct: Check that tutorial
 TobiasA: thanks
 fvla: I just looked back at my year old Coders Strike Back silver bot, and wow, it is horrible
 TobiasA: woah silver?
 Michael_Howard: A good strategy is having one racer race, and the other just attack the opposition.
 TobiasA: we got a smorty
 fvla: Silver doesn't have 2 racers yet
 TobiasA: woah that tutorial has GA that's badass
 fvla: Thanks for the advice though, Michael_Howard

 MadKnight: have u guys seen the Gravity Falls references in Rick &amp; Morty&#160;?
 Kitkat260: yes
 MadKnight: which ones&#160;?
 Kitkat260: id remember
 Michael_Howard: Did they increase the source code size limit?
 Michael_Howard: I'm at 110,000 chars (108k) and haven't been told off yet.
 Michael_Howard: If so, awesome. :thumbsup:
 jacek: huh
 jacek: nah, still 100k
 VizGhar: I remember, there was some issue with one puzzle + language combination, where there was no time limit&#160;:)
 VizGhar: what language are u using? 100k characters is quite a lot
 jacek: not for meh
 Michael_Howard: Maybe they're being sensible with whitespace now - treating spaces as tabs.
 Matty73: this code for one of the bot leagues? at 100k that's crazy numbers for games hahaha
 Michael_Howard: It's for Fall Challenge 2020. Getting some practice in&#160;:)
 Kitkat260: hi matty
 Matty73: Nice Michael and hi&#160;:)
 Kitkat260: how are you
 jacek: Michael_Howard you can try some codegolf puzzle and paste code there. it will count the characters
 Matty73: Im well and you?
 Hjax: yay they fixed rust release mode
 Kitkat260: im ok
 jacek: 3:
 Michael_Howard: @jacek I just used unix wc
 jacek: it may count differently than on CG

 Hjax: fine, kind of just chilling, waiting to see if the contest is something fun 
 jacek: pacman 2 eh
 Hjax: *shivers* 
 Kitkat260: * freaks ou*
 Hjax: the magical thing about the pacman game 
 Hjax: is it was really cleverly designed, to make itself look like a fun game
 Hjax: and then you played it for a bit and realized how random it was 
 Therabidpanther: hello friend
 Therabidpanther: (s)
 Hjax: hello
 KalamariKing: howdy
 Hjax: i havent done any competitive programming in a while, i should probably grab a multi to warm up before the contest 
 Hjax: but the odds of the contest disappointing me is pretty high
 TobiasA: what's a multi?
 Gemer0987: what 
 jacek: multiple singles
 TobiasA: what are singles?
 ZarthaxX: :face_palm:
 Hjax: that you can play whenever you want

 King_Coda: clash of the ring
 King_Coda: call of the rupees
 orangesnowfox: CotR = Code of the Rings, it's an optimization problem
 King_Coda: damn

 orangesnowfox: You want the minimum brainf*ck code to output an input string
 TobiasA: yea i suck at that
 King_Coda: :thinking:
 King_Coda: :dizzy_face::zzz:
 orangesnowfox: There's a really basic algorithm that doesn't get much score, but definitely *works* 
 Westicles: You can also do it manually.  I think one guy got around 50th place
 orangesnowfox: The half joking part is "well, selecting the *actual* optimal string is `O(7^n)` using bruteforce 
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, but then I'd have to RE the testcases, and I'm not really interested in doing that
 King_Coda: :neutral_face:
 TobiasA: what is RE?
 orangesnowfox: My specific goals are: "Do as good as possible without hardcoding"
 King_Coda: I definitely know what you're talking about
 orangesnowfox: RE = Reverse Engineering 
 King_Coda: Agh, my 120 IQ is failing me
 TobiasA: i'm on a learning streak
 King_Coda: Ew, I hate school
 TobiasA: me too
 King_Coda: why are they giving me 50 question post tests .
 orangesnowfox: school? What's that? :v
 King_Coda: we literally learned about 3 things this unit
 orangesnowfox: Anyway, gtg on a walk

 orangesnowfox: *girl...Wait, do I *want* to reveal that on the intern- whatever, it's fine
 King_Coda: It's world history

 orangesnowfox: lol
 King_Coda: oh
 King_Coda: i totally knew that
 King_Coda: the whole time
 King_Coda: yup
 TobiasA: king what subject is that test
 King_Coda: "It's world history"
 King_Coda: ^
 TobiasA: ohohohoh
 TobiasA: why?
 King_Coda: Because I apparently have to according to the education system
 King_Coda: not like I already learned it 4 times
 King_Coda: not like i even care
 TobiasA: understandable
 King_Coda: i'm going to procrastinate on that and instead do chemistry
 davilla: I think snow vixen's favorite color is orange just because that's the color of rust
 TobiasA: bruh
 King_Coda: rust is brown-red eh
 TobiasA: good desicion
 Westicles: There are no girls on the internet, and everything you learn in world history is lies
 TobiasA: chemistry good
 King_Coda: sometimes orange
 King_Coda: Thanks westicles lol
 TobiasA: i hate history
 King_Coda: How rude of me, I didn't even say hello to Astrobytes.
 King_Coda: Good morning.
 Astrobytes: Hello King_Coda
 TobiasA: he isn't here or she
 TobiasA: oops
 King_Coda: ^
 TobiasA: where did you come from
 Astrobytes: where did you go
 King_Coda: How have you been this weekend Astro?TobiasA: I don't hate it, I just don't like it
 Astrobytes: Good. You?
 TobiasA: wait wait
 BlaiseEbuth: Where did you come from, cotton-eyed Joe?
 orangesnowfox: ... Dropped back by because I needed to grab something before walking, orange isn't my favorite color, I'd just *not* put it in the name, but, well, snowfox is already taken 99% of the time lol
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth gets it
 TobiasA: how did you know astrobytes was going to show up
 BlaiseEbuth: of course
 Astrobytes: I saw the ping TobiasA
 King_Coda: Astrobytes: Great. I watched the Mortal Kombat Movieorangesnowfox: Okay, that makes sense
 TobiasA: ou
 King_Coda: BlaiseEbuth: Good morning
 TobiasA: oh it is morning?
 King_Coda: Btw, if anybody here is considering watching the Mortal Kombat movie, DO IT. The movie is AWESOME.
 King_Coda: TobiasA: Yeah, it's morning here
 TobiasA: where do i watch it
 King_Coda: HBO max i think
 King_Coda: if you don't already have it then abuse the free trial
 Astrobytes: I'll pass, thanks.
 King_Coda: It is very gory, so If you don't like gore, then don't watch it
 TobiasA: gore is alright
 King_Coda: I mean, VERY gory. It's Mortal Kombat, there's some gruesome stuff there
 Westicles: I like the highlander as raiden, but that was it
 King_Coda: I will not spoil it for those who have not yet watched
 Astrobytes: Gory eh.
 TobiasA: it can't be that bad
 Astrobytes: Try Cannibal Holocause
 Astrobytes: *Holocaust
 Therabidpanther: is there any chance we can get space cat back
 King_Coda: If you love video game movies and want to see Mortal Kombat characters kick heavy arse, then watch the movie.
 TobiasA: what is space cat?
 Astrobytes: I hate video game movies.
 King_Coda: Why's that Astrobytes?
 Therabidpanther: Astrobytes old profile pic
 Astrobytes: It wasn't in space. The cat was in front of my keyboard. Now it's in front of a musical keyboard.
 Astrobytes: King_Coda: Just personal taste.
 King_Coda: Okay, I understand.
 King_Coda: I love video games -&gt; I love video game movies
 Astrobytes: Hate is too strong, I don't like them.
 King_Coda: Doesn't really matter to me if it's good or bad, I just like seeing my favorite video game characters on the big screen.
 TobiasA: what are your favourite video game characters
 King_Coda: As long as the characters look good and the story exists, I'll enjoy it.
 King_Coda: Pretty much any videogame character.
 King_Coda: But if I had to choose, I'd say Minecraft Steve
 ShannonNorris97: They butchered the assassin's creed movie though. Having played the games, I understood what was happening, but for anyone who hadn't it must have been so confusing. It made no effort to explain anything, including what the apple of eden did
 TobiasA: shteve
 King_Coda: ShannonNorris97: I never watched the movie, all I know is that it was bad
 King_Coda: Also: Ezio Auditore fav assassin.
 King_Coda: call me a normie
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah it was a real shame - I had such high hopes for it
 ShannonNorris97: 100% - Ezio and his story were awesome
 King_Coda: I still don't have 2 and revelations, only brotherhood :disappointed:
 King_Coda: I need to get the whole ezio saga
 ShannonNorris97: Oh wow you're missing out! Assassin's creed 2 was one of the best in the series, if not the best
 King_Coda: Yeah, just the bonus hidden missions in brotherhood made me want the game
 Westicles: Robotron 2084, now that was a great game
 King_Coda: *made me want Assassin's creed 2
 ShannonNorris97: They have all sorts on AC2 in terms of extras. I think that was one of the main reasons I loved it as much as I did
 ShannonNorris97: Just had to google that Westicles - a little before my time haha
 King_Coda: Robotron 2084 is 40 years old westicles
 King_Coda: I have assasin's creed 1, brotherhood, and 3, so i have a lot of holes in my collection
 King_Coda: Westicles: Robotron 2084 looks goo dthough
 Phoenix_X.0: How can I access the problems I solved in the past? 
 BlaiseEbuth: First you need a Delorean
 King_Coda: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: And then a time convector
 TobiasA: then an infinty stone
 King_Coda: preferably the time stone, but the space or reality stone work just fine
 TobiasA: 1 table spoon full to be precise
 BlaiseEbuth: Mortal Kombat is a great nanar reference...
 King_Coda: nanar?
 TobiasA: you access your past solved problems by going to where the problems are
 King_Coda: a movie so bad it was good?
 TobiasA: or maybe search it in the search bar
 BlaiseEbuth: I have no idea (and don't find) how to translate it in english.
 BlaiseEbuth: A movie so bad it became fun
 TobiasA: what is nanar?
 jacek: narnia?
 King_Coda: nanar: a movie so bad it was good
 Astrobytes: Yes King_Coda, correct
 Westicles: best of the worst
 King_Coda: :nerd:
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll say fun more than good
 King_Coda: You talking about the new one BlaiseEbuth
 Westicles: I think he means 1995
 TobiasA: *loses 5 million times more braincells than i can afford
 Philbot: sharknado
 TobiasA: so is nanar good or bad
 BlaiseEbuth: They committed a new one?...
 King_Coda: Mortal Kombat: 2021
 jacek: aka covid?
 King_Coda: No
 King_Coda: Yes BlaiseEbuth, they made a new one that's actually good
 King_Coda: maybe i'm just biased though
 BlaiseEbuth: Covid is the new scorpion's fatality. He take of his mask and cough on the other guy.
 King_Coda: LOL
 King_Coda: The fire he breathes is actually just Covid
 Westicles: But it only works 0.2% of the time
 King_Coda: Yes.
 BlaiseEbuth: And the cinematic of the death is soooooooo long...
 King_Coda: it can take weeks to a month
 King_Coda: to several months
 Westicles: That game went off the rails in MK2 when they added babalities
 King_Coda: But if you can sit through it, then you unlock the covid vaccine and you end the pandemic in game and irl
 King_Coda: Oh, I remember the babalities
 WannaBeHum1n: An error occurred (#404): "Couldn't find the question related to this contribution".
 WannaBeHum1n: everytime i do test in ide i recieve this
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 King_Coda: WannaBeHum1n, I thought you were trying to say something rude for a second there
 King_Coda: Sounded like a fancy way of saying: "nobody asked"
 Kitkat260: wassup
 King_Coda: Nothing, chat is sleepy
 Kitkat260: nice...
 UUolfo: hey King_Coda have you considered learning python? that and c# are seeming to be most used today.
 King_Coda: I am currently learning C# UUolfo
 UUolfo: Right, but python tho lol
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 orangesnowfox: Why not just know all the languages :p
 King_Coda: ugh, i don't want to learn python
 Kitkat260: i'm using python 3
 UUolfo: I mean hell, he's young, he's got the time :P C# is a solid start. Tbh java and python and c# are pretty similar
 UUolfo: and nice Kitkat
 Kitkat260: its easy
 UUolfo: ^^^
 King_Coda: java is a c++ child iirc
 orangesnowfox: Kitkat, nobody here is using py 2 here lol
 Michael_Howard: Solved the 100k char mystery... they've started counting leading spaces as tabs. Saves me converting them in vim then pasting back when I hit the char limit.
 Kitkat260: i said 3 not 2
 orangesnowfox: I know, but the lack of py2 here means that python can only be py3
 Kitkat260: ohhhhh, ok
 King_Coda: lol
 Kitkat260: really
 jacek: oh my
 XeroOl: it's funny because according to codingame my second most used language is ruby
 KiwiTae: orangesnowfox there was a time we had py2 here
 orangesnowfox: KiwiTae, I remember, I golfed in it
 XeroOl: and I don't consider myself a ruby programmer
 KiwiTae: orangesnowfox good old time&#160;:')
 TobiasA: in a coders strike back tutorial the guy was using stuff like this.angle and vx, vy to move the stuff 
 XeroOl: py2 would be so good for golfing
 TobiasA: but i don't have access to such
 XeroOl: because you could just say `reduce` instead of `import functools functools.reduce`
 TobiasA: i need a lawyer
 KiwiTae: TobiasA you will have in next league
 orangesnowfox: XeroOI, I found that all of my py2 solutions were just about the same as the py3 ones
 KiwiTae: TobiasA just press the hint tab
 orangesnowfox: character count wise
 XeroOl: really, that's interesting
 TobiasA: hint tab?
 TobiasA: where is that?
 XeroOl: because in my mind, having reduce would help a ton
 orangesnowfox: I'm not really a python golfer, umm, temperatures might be the only one that would be different 
 XeroOl: but maybe a plain vanilla for loop is shorter than reduce either way
 KiwiTae: my thor golf in python is awful
 XeroOl: I have the worst thor golf ever lol
 Kitkat260: i need help
 KiwiTae: hardcoded for me&gt;&lt;
 XeroOl: its output switches from \n to \r\n down the middle
 orangesnowfox: Mine *broke* after they changed the validators lol
 Kitkat260: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85d5b617-6625-4fc7-88a2-57e7226dc793">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85d5b617-6625-4fc7-88a2-57e7226dc793</a>
 TobiasA: yo you guys are flexing
 XeroOl: because it's easier to rig the newlines
 orangesnowfox: Not hardcoded, but intentionally avoiding the missed testcase
 Kitkat260: help me solve it
 XeroOl: the missing north cases?
 TobiasA: i haven't even completed any of those "golf" stuff
 XeroOl: I never heard about that until after it was patched lol
 KiwiTae: its south now
 XeroOl: are there no south cases?
 KiwiTae: they changed the validators
 orangesnowfox: yeah, now it's south lol
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt;
 XeroOl: hold up isn't that cheating?
 orangesnowfox: Not really?
 KiwiTae: if it works 100% it works :p
 XeroOl: my python is at 1990 without cheating
 KiwiTae: lol
 XeroOl: 1990th place leaderboard
 KiwiTae: u can do 100char without cheating
 XeroOl: not 1990 chars
 XeroOl: that would be bad
 orangesnowfox: hollup, even if I was handling all 16 cases I'd be at like... 100chars
 orangesnowfox: oh
 XeroOl: 129 chars
 KiwiTae: im stuck at 83 atm
 XeroOl: maybe I'm dumb
 XeroOl: I did not think about the algorithm very well
 orangesnowfox: Actually, I'd be under 100 still I think
 XeroOl: yeah, I'm not that smart at golfing
 orangesnowfox: Golfing is an art :p
 XeroOl: I can do clash of code golfing, but I can't do the more complex stuff
 orangesnowfox: That reminds me... I did a clash golf once in like 7 chars
 KiwiTae: my solution starts with "N\n"*50
 King_Coda: python is the best for CoC
 orangesnowfox: for golf
 orangesnowfox:&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Because, that definitely isn't true
 IvesL: not python but ruby
 XeroOl: is there a short way to consume an iter?
 orangesnowfox: ^ ruby is definitely
 Westicles: ruby or perl
 XeroOl: I prefer ruby tbh
 orangesnowfox: perl does really good too yeah
 IvesL: almost all fast/shortest ones are ruby
 XeroOl: is there a way to consume an iterator in python
 TobiasA: "i did clash golf in 7 chars once" there goes my self esteem:expressionless:
 IvesL: python only beats in simplicity or readability
 XeroOl: I've got a map object and I just need it to execute
 XeroOl: to save chars
 XeroOl: list() is to costly
 orangesnowfox: Okay, it was 18, I just counted
 XeroOl: lmao python in readability
 IvesL: the use of "puts" in ruby is too short
 XeroOl: in lots of cases in ruby you can just use `p`
 IvesL: yea or that
 XeroOl: instead of `puts`
 IvesL: in most cases that i have seen
 IvesL: can never win against
 XeroOl: how does anybody get this thor code shorter
 XeroOl: I do not understand lol
 Westicles: unicode
 IvesL: i dont know how those 40chrs work in code golf with inputs
 TobiasA: anytime i see someone use ruby in clash of code shortest mode i quit immediately:relieved:
 XeroOl: just learn ruby
 XeroOl: that's how I did it lol
 TobiasA: nope
 TobiasA: i find know use to it
 TobiasA: no*
 King_Coda: know
 TobiasA: mistaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake
 TobiasA: hmph
 King_Coda: i no
 XeroOl: imo it's really natural to use
 Westicles: the good ones look like this
 Westicles: exec(bytes('浩潰瑲洠瑡㭨㵲㬰㵩㬱...
 TobiasA: i learnt it a long time ago
 King_Coda: oh god
 XeroOl: really?
 orangesnowfox: ... oh, that makes sense
 XeroOl: that's such a good idea
 TobiasA: then after everything i was like
 King_Coda: is that uncomplied C++?
 TobiasA: what next
 King_Coda: *compiled
 orangesnowfox: Wait, how does that execute? the bytes aren't going to be in ascii range...
 XeroOl: ^
 XeroOl: maybe I'm stupid
 Westicles: unicode characters are allowed
 orangesnowfox: Right, but the bytes of the unicode characters aren't going to be ascii, so, how does the exec / bytes work?
 XeroOl: yes but exec(bytes('chars')) is the same as exec('chars') which is the same as `chars`
 Westicles: beats me, I don't know much python
 XeroOl: how is it supposed to do anything different?
 XeroOl: ahh it might be pyc bytecode
 orangesnowfox: Can you exec that?
 XeroOl: maybe?
 King_Coda: i think i fell asleep
 XeroOl: is your &lt;100 python functional or imperative?
 XeroOl: I'm trying to see how this could be 20 chars shorter
 XeroOl: and I just don't see it
 King_Coda: *snore* :sleepy::zzz:
 XeroOl: ie, do you use `zip` / `map`, or `for`

 Kitkat260: what other open channels are there?
 Kitkat260: any one
 Kitkat260:&#160;?
 TobiasA: what is a channel?
 Kitkat260: chats
 TobiasA: nope
 Kitkat260: ok
 King_Coda: #clash
 King_Coda: Alex-1 is here
 King_Coda: wth were you guys doing in clash channel
 XeroOl: wait there's a clash channel?
 XeroOl: woah
 Westicles: #ru #fr #in
 KiwiTae: orangesnowfox its 16bits encoding of your code 
 orangesnowfox:&#160;?
 KiwiTae: ascii char contains 8bits
 orangesnowfox: yeah
 KiwiTae: chinese ones are 16bits
 orangesnowfox: Wait, what utf encoding
 KiwiTae: so take your code as a string utf16 encoding
 KiwiTae: it gives you the chinese version
 KiwiTae: then u can exec('encodedstr".decode()) or smth like that
 KiwiTae: got an overhead of 40smth chars though 
 orangesnowfox: ah, if it's utf16 that makes sense
 orangesnowfox: I was thinking utf-8 lol
 KiwiTae: XeroOl want me to check your version maybe i can hint some tips
 Kitkat260: anyone here in their teens
 Kitkat260:&#160;?
 Westicles: According to previous chat, the overhead in python/js/ruby is all 25-26 characters
 KiwiTae: damn Oo they do it better than what i tried lol
 KiwiTae: gotta investigate
 KiwiTae: :D
 Westicles: exec(bytes('gibberish','u16')[2:]) 
 King_Coda: who is gigolo and why did they follow me
 KiwiTae: King_Coda you are famous dunno
 KiwiTae: Westicles I didnt know you can do that Oo
 King_Coda: I keep getting followers, and I'm literally NOT EVEN IN CHAT
 Kitkat260: u code right?
 King_Coda: Me? Yes...
 Kitkat260: so thats why
 TobiasA: damn king_coda is a social media celeb
 King_Coda: ...
 Kitkat260: amen

 KiwiTae: TobiasA you figured the velocity thing? &gt;&lt;
 King_Coda: :interrobang:
 TobiasA: yea yea
 gigolo: hey vro
 King_Coda: gigolo, explain
 Kitkat260: hey
 King_Coda: why are random people following me
 TobiasA: gimme a sec lemme follow this king
 King_Coda: I don't even contribute to anything on this website besides the occasional conversation in chat
 gigolo: lol
 King_Coda: And even then my input is of varying quality
 Kitkat260: haha
 Alshock: but it's for your output they follow you :P
 King_Coda: TobiasA I swear
 King_Coda: I guess so Alshock?
 TobiasA: bruh the thing isn't coming up 
 King_Coda: No, not KiwiTae too!
 Kitkat260: haha
 KiwiTae: :joy: pewpew
 gigolo: :joy:
 TobiasA: i promise today or tomorrow i will follow you
 King_Coda: Hover over my pfp?
 Kitkat260: :joy:
 TobiasA: and get your autograph
 King_Coda: or you can type my username in the search bar
 Kitkat260: yes!!!!
 King_Coda: My... autograph

 King_Coda: there's my autograph
 TobiasA: coda
 TobiasA: i am never washing my screen again
 King_Coda: wth
 TobiasA: hehehehohohohaha
 King_Coda: I really need to wash my screen
 King_Coda: and my keyboard
 TobiasA: really?
 TobiasA: send a video that
 TobiasA: when you do it
 TobiasA: that would be amazing
 ZarthaxX: KiwiTae i follow anyone that follows me
 King_Coda: Um... why?
 ZarthaxX: :P
 TobiasA: a very good idea
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX!
 ZarthaxX: hai
 King_Coda: Hello comrade
 King_Coda: random people are following me for no reason again
 ZarthaxX: happens :P
 TobiasA: the whole site is frozen for me except chat
 ZarthaxX: just random clashers or bots/trolls hehe
 King_Coda: I haven't been active in chat for 2 days though...
 King_Coda: Ugh, I will never understand this site.
 King_Coda: TobiasA type chrome://restart into your address bar and hit enter
 ZarthaxX: same here :P
 King_Coda: that works for me

 King_Coda: TobiasA
 King_Coda: You...
 King_Coda: Jumpmaster testing your conts now
 Jumpmaster: Cool, thanks
 gigolo: well
 TobiasA: how wonderful
 gigolo: reverse is possible for that clash&#160;??
 TobiasA: i am now a follower of the king
 gigolo: not that hard but yeah still good
 King_Coda: Jumpmaster the first one is a little too mathy for my taste, but that's just my bias. It's a good contribution and works well enough.
 King_Coda: Jumpmaster the second one is more my style. I like the "settlers of catan" thing you got going on. My coding skills are garbage, but the goal you stated was clear, so good job.
 TobiasA: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Jumpmaster: Thanks! 
 Jumpmaster: Is the first one too mathy for reverse?
 King_Coda: No, I find the mathy ones to be easiest for reverse.
 KalamariKing: As long as its not something too complex, idk like multi-stage quantum calculus or smth, the mathy ones are fun
 TobiasA: King_Coda are you still here
 King_Coda: yes
 TobiasA: how many bot programming games have you reached bronze league or higher?
 KalamariKing: TobiasA have you gotten better at the csb thing?
 King_Coda: non
 King_Coda: *none
 gigolo: well that csb is the simplest one right&#160;?
 TobiasA: i'm getting better
 King_Coda: i don't code on here
 KalamariKing: :0
 TobiasA: but i'm still learning
 TobiasA: waaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!
 KalamariKing: You'll get there
 TobiasA: you don't code here?
 King_Coda: nope
 King_Coda: not yet
 King_Coda: still learning
 TobiasA: then who are you?
 King_Coda: i just lurk in chat like a weirdo
 gigolo: :rolling_eyes:
 TobiasA: i thought you were some kind of pro
 King_Coda: What, no
 King_Coda: What made you think that
 TobiasA: i even followed you:expressionless:
 King_Coda: I'm still learning C#
 King_Coda: And I do participate in CoC when I feel like it
 TobiasA: well you sound like a pro
 King_Coda: but i haven't made a contribution yet
 TobiasA: bet you are a pro in c#
 King_Coda: Eh
 King_Coda: I'm modest
 Philbot: this chat is weird
 King_Coda: indeed Philbot
 TobiasA: pretty sure you're learning it for unity
 King_Coda: yup
 TobiasA: am i right or am i right
 TobiasA: brings back memories
 King_Coda: Unity and VR
 TobiasA: noice
 KalamariKing: Programming for VR is awesome
 TobiasA: indeed
 FloatingQueen: Hey how to join coding escape game, I am kinda stuck :grimacing:

 TobiasA: just like that
 KiwiTae: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1421550817913990/?locale=en_US">https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1421550817913990/?locale=en_US</a> I did that one with my team some time back 
 KiwiTae: ported from mobile to vr
 FloatingQueen: @King_Coda Thanks&#160;!
 King_Coda: yw
 FloatingQueen: It says I need invitation link, when I go to frineds link it just show that I am currently #483
 nisarga: You need to request for an early access...then they will mail you regarding the access.
 KalamariKing: Imagine winning a coc with only 20% correct
 VizGhar: you vs bot? :D
 KalamariKing: Nope lol
 KalamariKing: Me v 7 others
 TobiasA: rip others
 VizGhar: mg... what type?
 VizGhar: reverse?
 KalamariKing: Shortest
 KalamariKing: So we all had the full 15 minutes
 KalamariKing: I was the only one without a 0%
 KalamariKing: The challenge was way too hard for a coc, something like determining if a string alternates between consonants and vowels, with double letters collapsed into one letter
 King_Coda: I need assistance
 TobiasA: damn
 King_Coda: But it requires patience and intelligence. If you do not possess either of these then you don't need to answer the question.
 TobiasA: i don't possess the second
 King_Coda: So please, tell me why...
 King_Coda: ...I keep getting followers
 TobiasA: ummmm
 TobiasA: eeehhhhh.....
 LPNay: i am new to coding help
 TobiasA: i think
 TobiasA: i dunno why
 TobiasA: no need to worry
 TobiasA: why?
 TobiasA: because i am here
 TobiasA: what seems to be the problem new guy?
 VizGhar: Is it just me, or quality of this chat is going down like too rapidly? Is it because of upcomming contest?
 LPNay: im not sure how to write the code
 KalamariKing: VizGhar yeah I think so
 KalamariKing: LPNay could you elaborate?
 LPNay: Basically i couldn't achieve the goal because I wasn't sure how to type it in the script
 KalamariKing: Which puzzle?
 KalamariKing: That describes literally everything on this site
 LPNay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72a2239e-28b4-49cb-ab60-9a7e9a74c028">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72a2239e-28b4-49cb-ab60-9a7e9a74c028</a>
 KalamariKing: So in simpler terms, what is it asking for?
 LPNay: Search for the smallest number, for every case i need to have an answer within regular interger range
 KalamariKing: The smallest number where what is true?
 LPNay: the sum of digits n and m equls m-n or n-m
 Kitkat260: #at
 KalamariKing: Since you're searching for the smallest number, it's gonna be a loop starting at 1 and going up. If the loop var + the given var = either of those, you have your answer
 Kitkat260: its -1
 LPNay: AH ok, just wasnt sure how to translate it into a script
 KalamariKing: Kitkat260 4 + (-1)&#160;!= 4 - (-1)Reduced, 4-1&#160;!= 4+1
 Kitkat260: oh
 KalamariKing: That's the challenge, it changes per var n
 KalamariKing: Now I have a clash to win, I got 4min 10sec, brb
 LPNay: gl
 Kitkat260: a lot of people r following me&#160;:)
 Kitkat260: *KalamariKing i msg u
 KalamariKing: I saw hold on
 Kitkat260: ok
 Kitkat260: hurry i got 3 mins and 20 seconds
 King_Coda: I hate the stackoverflow community
 KalamariKing: We back
 Kitkat260: ok
 KalamariKing: King_Coda it's so toxic
 King_Coda: there are people on there who downvote crap just because they feel like it. I just got a huge chunk of my reputation taken out because of downvoters
 King_Coda: I was 1 reputation away from getting a new priveliage
 KalamariKing: Awwh&#160;:(
 KalamariKing: Would you post the q here?
 KalamariKing: Like the link
 TobiasA: i just finished the coding escape tutorial
 TobiasA: just to find out there is no single player mode
 KalamariKing: King_Coda I saw you had asked for assistance earlier, sorry I couldn't reply, but are you still wondering?
 King_Coda: oh hold on
 KalamariKing: TobiasA ik it was so depressing to find out I needed multiple people
 King_Coda: KalamariKing you want me to post the link?
 KalamariKing: If you want
 KalamariKing: I'm willing to help
 King_Coda: ok
 King_Coda: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67374906/simple-ai-duels-in-ruby-or-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67374906/simple-ai-duels-in-ruby-or-python</a> it's a long one
 King_Coda: I honestly just want the upvote at this point, i don't even need the question to be answered KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: This is the fencing thing right?
 KalamariKing: Or something similar?
 King_Coda: yep
 King_Coda: YO 
 King_Coda: i just got 6 reputation out of nowhere
 King_Coda: GOD the stackoverflow mods are SALTY
 King_Coda: wth
 KalamariKing: Lmao ikr
 KalamariKing: StackOverflow is way too toxic to be helpful&#160;:/
 King_Coda: this guy named "chris" just left some REALLY nasty comments on my question
 King_Coda: he's a mod and he just shut the question down
 KalamariKing: Yeah I saw
 King_Coda: idefk why
 KalamariKing: He didn't even take the time to read the question to determine that its length was necessary
 King_Coda: EXACTLY
 JRBionic: Stack overflow is my absolute last resort, it never used to be so gatekeepy, now they behave like discord mods if you pop a meme in general
 TobiasA: that's why i never use stackoverflow
 TobiasA: it is overrated
 King_Coda: I only wanted to get some privs
 King_Coda: now i see my mistake
 King_Coda: i will not use stackoverflow
 KalamariKing: JRBionic "like discord mods if you pop a meme in general" that's the best description I've heard yet lol
 JRBionic: *bows*
 King_Coda: :clap:
 JRBionic: Tbh I am still in university, and im used to the gatekeeping now, but I remember getting a scathing comment from a S/O Mod in my first year, really put me off
 Westicles: Lots of mentally ill people flock to programming.  They like the structure
 KalamariKing: Now you've made me question my sanity
 TobiasA: :joy:
 JRBionic: We are all nuts, we spend our free time doing complex math on a website. this is not behavior of sane people lol
 King_Coda: JRBionic I just got a question shut down because i was "too long". There was no short way to ask the question!!!!!!
 JRBionic: I honestly think they just do that because they can't be arsed to read it
 JRBionic: typical desk jockey with one too many mountain dew bottles on the floor my friend
 TobiasA: being insane is the only way to stay sane these days
 JRBionic: Amen
 King_Coda: indeed
 Westicles: Pick a random wiki page and change something and see who crawls out from under a rock to complain.  Same crowd
 JRBionic: I remember thinking that programming would be great when I took this degree, now I spend my evening searching for missing semi-colons, not quite the Faang lifestyle I had in mind
 TobiasA: :joy:
 TobiasA: RIP
 JRBionic: RIP indeed
 KalamariKing: I'm back, how toxic should I be to the mods
 KalamariKing: 1. I don't wanna get banned but 2. Their behavior isn't right
 struct: please have mercy on me&#160;:(
 KalamariKing: Nah, s/o mods
 King_Coda: No not you struct
 TobiasA: toxic**10000
 King_Coda: stackoverflow
 KalamariKing: Btw struct I wanna talk to you, privately, if you're open, there's someone who I think is relatively new who I also believe is... how do I say, not interested in ADULTS per se
 King_Coda: kitkat260?
 JRBionic: We need to make a new stackoverflow, with blackjack and hookers ( points for getting the reference)
 KalamariKing: King_Coda yup
 King_Coda: I understand the words, but not the reference
 King_Coda: yeah she was hitting on me a few days ago
 TobiasA: 0 points for me
 King_Coda: and she asked me out
 King_Coda: it was weird
 struct: I would talk with thibaud or email cg
 TobiasA: woah
 King_Coda: anyways, blaiseebuth warned her
 struct: im just a chat moderator
 KalamariKing: I know that there are some younger folk on this website, in this chat, and I know that some of them would willingly give her what she is asking for (name, age, loc, etc)
 Jumpmaster: sounds like phishing
 TobiasA: things went left real quick
 KalamariKing: Jumpmaster kinda, but in a perv-y kinda way
 struct: KalamariKing emailing cg or Messaging thibaud on discord would be the best way
 King_Coda: if she is still misbehaving, then i think she might have to be banned, seeing as she's already been warned by a moderator
 Westicles: kk260 is almost certainly some guy from the gov't
 TobiasA: fax
 JRBionic: Gross
 KalamariKing: struct I don't have discord tho -- as in not allowed to, so I can't just make an acc
 KalamariKing: Sorry for 'dirtying' up the chat, on a different topic: s/o ban speedrun, left a toxic comment to a toxic mod, let's see how fast I'm gone
 KalamariKing: King_Coda I promise I'm still working on this, I haven't forgotten
 JRBionic: KalamariKing (sorry not sure how to tag ) just seen your comment lol
 King_Coda: lol KalamariKing you really don't have to
 struct: I think this email should do helpdesk@codingame.com
 JRBionic: I give it 5 minutes before Chris big potatoes bans you
 struct: Also I think you can report the profile.
 King_Coda: "Whoever just downvoted this question should read the whole question and realize the length is necessary, then read this answer and realize that I'm not balancing a downvote, but am voting for the content of the question. Thank you for your generous input, though, Chris!"
 JRBionic: An outstanding response good sir
 King_Coda: Indeed :clap:
 TobiasA: :clap::ok_hand:
 JRBionic: After all this I have completely forgotten the solution to the problem i'm working on, I was so close  :joy:
 TobiasA: i feel you
 KalamariKing: Lol sorry JRBionic
 KalamariKing: Gl tho, I'm working on something too and forgot
 JRBionic: How do you tag me?
 JRBionic: First time using the chat on this site
 KalamariKing: I only learned a few days ago
 KalamariKing: Simply type out the username
 struct: just type the person name, you can use tab to auto complete
 King_Coda: JRBionic just type the name of the person you want to tag like this
 KalamariKing: Wait you can use tab to autocomplete?
 King_Coda: struct :angry:
 JRBionic: King_Coda woah
 JRBionic: Did that work?
 King_Coda: yes. type "ki" then press tab
 King_Coda: yes JRBionic
 KalamariKing: King_Coda :o
 KalamariKing: SICK
 JRBionic: outstanding
 TobiasA: KalamariKing
 JRBionic: Thanking you all kindly
 TobiasA: i am just knowing this after 3 years
 King_Coda: Really?
 King_Coda: I found this out on my first day.
 TobiasA: yesh
 KalamariKing: us programmers, among the best at programming, all marvelling at the simple features of a chat client
 JRBionic: I can hear the respective "ooh's and aah's" Amongst us
 JRBionic: now that's some fancy 1's and 0's
 TobiasA: that's how you know there is a screw loose
 Aleximimus: Hello everyone. Has anyone done the easy Asteroids puzzle?
 JRBionic: Aleximimus Yes
 TobiasA: asteroids?
 TobiasA: where is that?
 JRBionic: TobiasA I'm pretty sure it's the first easy puzzle you are greeted with
 TobiasA: oh is it onboarding
 JRBionic: I believe so TobiasA
 TobiasA: or whatever they call it
 Westicles: All the US programmers I know are current or former H-1Bs
 TobiasA: well goodnight hoomans
 Aleximimus: I have passes all test cases but can't pass a validator and I have no idea what to change anymore
 JRBionic: What's a H-1B
 TobiasA: my eyes are heavy bye
 JRBionic: and goodnight TobiasA
 Aleximimus: byw TobiasA
 TobiasA: i have to try this one more time
 Westicles: immigrant work visa
 TobiasA: JRBionic
 TobiasA: how wonderful
 King_Coda: goodnight TobiasA
 JRBionic: TobiasA Marvelous 
 TobiasA: such a wonderful feature
 jacek: Aleximimus what puzzle
 Aleximimus: Asteroids , by XorZy
 KalamariKing: I hated that one
 KalamariKing: The last test sucked, fsr I couldn't get it to append a row
 Aleximimus: I hate it as well. Validator 10 won't pass for some reason
 JRBionic: What lanhuasge are you writing in Aleximimus
 Aleximimus: C++
 JRBionic: Ah, not my realm then
 KalamariKing: I know SOME cpp
 Tannazsh: hi
 Aleximimus: If i only knew why validator is failing i could fix it. Only thing i got to work with is test cases, which always pass
 Aleximimus: No matter how i round the coordinates
 KalamariKing: Yeah I got like 70% on this and said screw it
 Aleximimus: KalamariKing how did you calculate coordinates?
 Westicles: Here you go
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60b035d7-3de9-4ede-bc87-6fc58bc9cbb8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60b035d7-3de9-4ede-bc87-6fc58bc9cbb8</a>
 Aleximimus: Oh awesome!
 Aleximimus: Thank you very much! &lt;3
 KalamariKing: Thanks Westicles! I'm stealing that too
 Aleximimus: You are a life savior
 KalamariKing: Wait how'd you get that?
 Westicles: The last line of the output got cut off, it is ............H.......
 jacek: he slept with the creator
 King_Coda: lol
 KalamariKing: Wait a sec you don't have to make the third frame bigger if the asteroids go off-frame
 Aleximimus: Nah. If they out of frame you just leave them be
 Aleximimus: Meaning you ignore those
 KalamariKing: AWWH F
 KalamariKing: THATS WHY I WAS FAILING
 Aleximimus: Yeeeey i did it
 BlaiseEbuth: Yo. What was the ping for?
 BlaiseEbuth: What happened?
 BlaiseEbuth: What have I missed
 BlaiseEbuth: Tell me everything :ear:
 Aleximimus: I don't know who pinged you. People were helping me with the asteroids puzzle
 King_Coda: KitKat260
 King_Coda: She's at it again
 Aleximimus: Westicles was kind enough to provide validator that was bothering me and i finally did it ^^
 BlaiseEbuth: gg
 BlaiseEbuth: With you King_Coda?
 King_Coda: nope
 King_Coda: other people
 King_Coda: she stopped talking to me after you warned her, but now she's gone into chat again
 jacek: oO
 Aleximimus: btw whats that sign next to your names guys?
 Aleximimus: Ah never mind
 BlaiseEbuth: :weary:
 Aleximimus: I'm just being stupid haha
 jacek: time?
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 Aleximimus: :joy:
 Astrobytes: miklla: holy crap
 King_Coda: The sign next to their names states them as a moderator
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Isee
 jacek:&#160;?
 King_Coda: Astrobytes!
 miklla: Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Aleximimus: King_Coda yeah i realised the moment after i asked lol
 Astrobytes: jacek: Clobber
 jacek: :F
 Astrobytes: Not bad at all!Care to explain anything miklla? :D
 King_Coda: Dungeons and Bragons
 jacek: math is for those who can't brute force out the solution :unamused:
 BlaiseEbuth: KalamariKing have you talk to struct&#160;?
 miklla: alpha-beta with yeadscratcher heuristic and complex datastructures which apply theory of partizan games
 miklla: headscratcher*
 struct: blaise I told him to talk with thibaud or email cg
 miklla: still much to improve
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm k, cause I already warned her about that. 
 struct: Its some weird stuff
 struct: yeah he told me so
 Astrobytes: miklla: Very, very nice. I'm impressed.
 KalamariKing: BlaiseEbuth not yet, I got sidetracked and just got back, lemme read the backlog of msg's yet (I might have missed something important, evident of your ping)
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course you are. As a cat you love headscratchers...
 struct: I finally made some progress on eval&#160;:)
 jacek: stc?
 Astrobytes: Nice struct&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol Blaise
 struct: Its something else jacek I use stc as decoy
 struct: Maybe its yinsh boss
 miklla: I used Sprague–Grundy theory in D&amp;B, pretty simple, but clobber requires theory of partizan games, much complex stuff
 KalamariKing: BlaiseEbuth kitkat (idw ping) was at it again
 KalamariKing: So many mods rn, hey guys
 Aleximimus: More mods then non-mods lol
 JRBionic: Commenting to balance out the mod-nonmod Ratio :grin:
 Astrobytes: Miklla: Yeah, I remember Smits was doing the whole nimstring thing in D&amp;B, I didn't even try that one properly yet.Your Clobber bot is a great achievement.
 miklla: still big room to improve, sad that context will interrupt me from that&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Well, don't forget where you were at and you can resume after :D
 King_Coda: agh
 Astrobytes: jacek: fixit. ezpz
 King_Coda: i didn't get any school done today, crap
 Astrobytes: Home schooling?
 King_Coda: why am I so ineffecient
 Westicles: Solomon Grundy... I'll have to look into that
 King_Coda: yes, homeschooling
 Astrobytes: All I know is he was born on a Monday Westicles :P
 King_Coda: i'm behind by 11 assignments
 JRBionic: King_Coda I spend my life in a perpetual cycle of Stressing about the work I need to do, and then relaxing because i'm stressing myself too much :joy:
 Astrobytes: Fix your concentration King_Coda
 BlaiseEbuth: Use my starter and go legend
 King_Coda: Okay DAD
 King_Coda: But I will concentrate better
 KalamariKing: King_Coda 1. You got this, take it in chunks 2. lol me too, but I'm not homeschooled and grades just came in and :o yeesh
 King_Coda: I need to catch up and do some of my future work in advance so I don't have to do any school on my birthday
 King_Coda: I turn 16 on May 5
 Westicles: Homeschooled means you just have to talk your Mom into giving you A's?
 King_Coda: No
 King_Coda: Online school
 BlaiseEbuth: So bad... You're a day too young...
 King_Coda: i need to do 9 assignments a day for the next to days to complete my goal
 King_Coda: shouldnt be too hard
 King_Coda: wish me luck
 King_Coda: *2 days not to days
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... Luck... May the 4th be with you
 Astrobytes: Oh sht, May 4th is my friend's borthday, thx for the reminder Blaise.
 Astrobytes: *birthday
 Westicles: cinco de mayo, not a bad day for a birthday
 orangesnowfox: May 4th is a family member's birthday...
 Hjax: @Astrobytes are they a Star Wars fan 
 KalamariKing: orangesnowfox the fourth is strong in this one
 Astrobytes: Hjax: Not religiously but a fan of the original movie series yes :D
 orangesnowfox: mm, he did like starwars iirc, it's been a few years 
 Hjax: star wars day is a neat birthday to have 
 Westicles: Ouch, mother's day this weekend.  Got to buy something for the old bat
 Hjax: my birthday should be called Science Day, date of the Trinity Nuclear Test, date of the Apollo 11 Launch
 Astrobytes: I've tried to come up with star wars related gifts in the past but it usually ends up being a crate of lager or a litre of vodka
 orangesnowfox: lol
 orangesnowfox: "shirt"
 orangesnowfox: my birthday already has a holiday name, I don't get to name it :pensive:
 Astrobytes: Hiroshima Day is 1 day before my birthday&#160;:/
 hahajokes: oof
 Hjax: if you look hard enough, im sure you can find something unslightly on every day 
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month_day">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month_day</a>
 Westicles: Astrobytes, conceived on Guy Fawkes Day?
 KalamariKing: Rip my birthday is on the famed disappearance of malaysian airlines 370
 KalamariKing: Awwh two days too early to be the 69th day of the year... we were this close...
 orangesnowfox: My date of birth was a couple months after 9/11 ._.
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: You'll like this, I share a birthday with Elizabeth Báthory
 BlaiseEbuth: &lt;3
 Astrobytes: Westicles: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: My birthday is the day when Hitler took the lead of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht...
 orangesnowfox: Just occurred to me, someone born on October 11th of 2012 is 9 (rounding their age up to nearest year), born on 10/11/12
 Astrobytes: nice
 r-k-g: I find the fact that someone born in 2012 is 9 crazier than the date thing
 r-k-g: how has it been that many years since 2012!
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. I have some cool co-birthday: Charles Lindbergh, George Romero and Alice Cooper.
 Astrobytes: George Romero and Alice Cooper! Awesome :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Bleuuarggg
 Astrobytes: Lindbergh ofc is cool, but George Romero for starters
 firstPlayer: hoi
 KalamariKing: Hello firstPlayer
 KalamariKing: Also: I left for like 15 min and we're still on birthdays?
 KalamariKing: 20 minutes, correction, after looking back at the msgs
 Westicles: We could talk more about the OKW.  I really don't know much at all about Jodl
 BlaiseEbuth: Birthdays are life! literally...
 KalamariKing: BlaiseEbuth lolWesticles OKWhat?
 Westicles: ^^ Oberkommando der Wehrmacht
 KalamariKing: Huh
 KalamariKing: You were saying something earlier about Oktoberfest right
 Westicles: That they are pansies for cancelling it?
 KalamariKing: 'pansies' lol
 r31415: Hi! Is there a way to disable the language-assist-popups in the coding window?
 Astrobytes: Other than closing the window, I don't believe there are I'm afraid
 Hjax: a lot of people prefer to develop in a separate IDE, and then copy paste into the web interfact
 Hjax: interface* 
 Astrobytes: Hjax beat me to it
 r31415: Yeah, I know why.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: There's some browser-based plugins too
 KalamariKing: I was gonna say, aren't there plugins
 r31415: (There are even vim-bindings, but unfortunately, they are quite broken.)
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-resources/187070">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-resources/187070</a>
 KalamariKing: Thanks Blaise
 r31415: Thanks.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's not CG's fault, it's just Monaco. They and others have made a bunch of changes to it, so do feel free to contribute
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: How is that not pinned anyway
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: hi
 BlaiseEbuth: Never the CG fault... :rolling_eyes:
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: its me again
 Astrobytes: No in this case it's the Monaco devs
 KalamariKing: Hello WaterCooledTopHat_3613, interesting name
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :grin:
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: ive been in this chat
 r31415: But it's CGs fault, that everyone here produces bad/ugly code.&#160;;)
 Hjax: i see some discussion about adding an architecture flag the rust compiler on this site, i wonder how much of a performance difference it makes 
 KalamariKing: I gtg, cy'all later
 BlaiseEbuth: Technically it's pinned in the forum Astrobytes
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :confused:
 Astrobytes: I must have my categories mixed up :D
 Hjax: right now rust isnt set to to autodetect architecture, which means its probably not optimizing as much as it can 
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :confused::confused::confused::confused::confused::confused::confused::confused:
 Astrobytes: can't you specify it in rust?
 Hjax: its a command line arg to the compiler, someone is asking for it to be set properly in the languages discussion on the forum 
 Astrobytes: well, I mean like arch=native or something
 Hjax: yeah, thats what is being asked for 
 Hjax: im kind of surprised it wasnt like that already 
 Astrobytes: gotcha, sorry
 BlaiseEbuth: No pragma in Rust&#160;?
 Astrobytes: That's why they're rusting
 Hjax: i dont think any language comes close to the C family in terms of preprocessor tricks 
 Astrobytes: They'll change it to Shiny! once the problems are ironed out :P
 Hjax: im not aware of any sort of gaming you can do to the compiler in your code
 Hjax: otherwise i would have specified release builds myself ages ago
 Hjax: instead of praying for codingame to fix it 
 Hjax: (which they did, yay)
 Astrobytes: You could send binaries in multis though
 Hjax: thats true, but im lazy
 Hjax: i want it to just work 
 Astrobytes: Me too lol
 Hjax: and now it does, which is great, rust development wont suck during the contest
 Hjax: any we are on a shiny new release of rust 
 Hjax: and*
 Astrobytes: And testing against Rustaceans won't be so awful either&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Be happy, they will never update it again
 Hjax: im trying to break my dependency on java and python in contests 
 Hjax: both of those languages have issues when you only have 50 ms to work with 
 Astrobytes: Embrace the language you prefer to use and make it work for you.
 BlaiseEbuth: Pleonasm, Hjax
 Hjax: rust is becoming a pretty marketable skill anyway 
 Astrobytes: Some contests python or j*** are gonna be just fine, others, not so
 Hjax: so its worth improving at 
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's growing a lot
 Hjax: ill never stop laughing at my PR2 bot 
 Hjax: its literally, import numpy, run munkres, get top 20 
 Hjax: definitely an easy python game
 Astrobytes: the python one with the imported munkres?
 Hjax: yep 
 Astrobytes: lol yeah
 Hjax: its actually such a brain dead bot, i can hardly take credit for it 
 Hjax: i didnt even implement the algo myself 
 Hjax: but thats what makes it amusing to me 
 Astrobytes: But you did make it work for you. 
 Astrobytes: The difficulty of that notwithstanding
 Hjax: i wonder if theres any other games that you can trivially do well on with an "import scipy"
 Astrobytes: probably a few
 BlaiseEbuth: import win
 Astrobytes: import BlaiseCompetition dies
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah that's a module that ban the opponent
 Astrobytes: import sin.vanity
 BlaiseEbuth: import sin.*
 Astrobytes: I only import my favourites
 BlaiseEbuth: Me too
 Westicles: They say if you list off the deadly sins, the one you think of last is the one you have a problem with
 BlaiseEbuth: That's probably why I never can remember any of them...
 Astrobytes: I only remember vanity from Devil's Advocated
 Astrobytes: *Advocate
 Astrobytes: And maybe some others from 7even if I watch it again
 struct: I hate this chat bug where I cant scroll
 Astrobytes: Or Se7en whatever it was called
 Astrobytes: IT's getting 
 Astrobytes: worse by the day struct
 Westicles: Shazam as well
 Smelty: rip
 davilla: Is there a way to see all the contributions I've approved?
 davilla: Sorry if I've asked before.
 Westicles: nope
 davilla: d'oh OK thanks
 davilla: I guess I can just go thu them
 davilla: all
 davilla: mine would be fairly recent
 Westicles: Are you looking for ones that got 3 approvals?  Those you can search
 davilla: yes, I found one
 davilla: but it doesn't show the approval comments, so I can't see the code I posed&#160;:(

 davilla: wait, is that my code?
 Westicles: yeh
 davilla: wow, unrecognizable
 davilla: OK cool you're a magician
 Westicles: It doesn't seem to work though...
 davilla: no prob I'll fix it... as I recall, I wasn't level 20 yet so I didn't actually approve this one
 davilla: in fact looking thu these I think this might be the only one, so maybe I learned my lesson soon enough
 Westicles: Does this work for you?

 Westicles: You can search by title on that herokuapp link, then it gives you a link to the contribution
 davilla: oh wow I did that but missed the link
 davilla: awesome, very useful, I approve now
 spiralpinata: hi!
 davilla: hi there
 spiralpinata: this game is kinda cool
 spiralpinata: i am bad at writing shorter code
 spiralpinata: but I can do it pretty fast enough
 davilla: yeah, I don't know if it's a good thing to be good at writing cryptic code&#160;:-P
 Notter: Imagine a chase scene where you have to solve CoC puzzles to advance forward

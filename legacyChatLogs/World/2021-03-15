 AntiSquid: united nations - out of touch Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol, gotcha
 Astrobytes: I'd progressed to this (it was in my history) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ExMknnK3E&amp;t=288s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ExMknnK3E&amp;t=288s</a>

 mororo250: it's fine.I think it was a bug
 AntiSquid: has a good beat
 AntiSquid: sounds similar to some other random songs i heard which probably got inspired from it&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: It's from 1993 so yeah probably
 Astrobytes: Similar style from '94 AntiSquid:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kibq1xUarOw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kibq1xUarOw</a>
 AntiSquid: i occasionally open up random radio stations with 90s / 00s music
 AntiSquid: it's kind of a global trend at that point in time i think
 Astrobytes: These two were UK underground rave kinda tunes
 Astrobytes: Anyway. I am shattered. Gn AntiSquid and everyone
 AntiSquid: gn8

 dirty_code: h
 dirty_code: hey I have an idea for simple clash of code problem
 RokasRimasauskas:&#160;:^)
 derjack: good morning
 AntiSquid: #clash for clash links ninja143coder
 jacek: the potw author has beautiful avatar
 derjack: agreed
 aster27: hello guys, are you all studying or working
 KiwiTae: workin
 aster27: as?
 aster27: what domain are you guys studying for
 tutubalin: Question for leaders in Bulls and Cows 2: how many times you resubmitted to reach your standing?
 darkhorse64: I submitted 24 times; half of these were really tests for new features
 AntiSquid: not at the top, but i submitted multiple times and get on average very similar score :P
 AntiSquid: i didn't finish my script, but i am sure that you get on average about same result, only worth spamming submits when it's very close
 tutubalin: i ask because, my average is about 320, but i've got lucky submit with score 300.
 MSmits: it's probably a bell curve, so yeah multiple submits help, but you have to set a limit for yourself. Say 50 submits and then call it a day
 tutubalin: so i wonder about 290-300 results: is it actually something way smarter than my solution, or just luckier submit
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: doesnt have to be way smarter. Can just be one thing
 MSmits: you can also *play* to the luck factor in the algorithm
 derjack: oh, i got so pushed in uttt
 MSmits: you can make choices that give high expected reward
 MSmits: or make choices that give a high maximum reward
 MSmits: the distribution matters
 MSmits: if you go for high maximum, then luck matters more
 MSmits: and multiple submits help more
 MSmits: you should do local testing and obtain a distribution
 tutubalin: good idea!
 ill-be-waiting-outside: hey
 AntiSquid: ya hardcode all corner cases for each n :D
 MSmits: stil have to do bulls and cows mysef
 MSmits: I played it a lot when i was young
 MSmits: so kinda like the fact that it's on here
 tutubalin: hardcoding can be pretty good for the first 3-4 actions
 AntiSquid: i didn't code the optimal algo yet
 AntiSquid: it's the most simple selection ever
 tutubalin: i haven't digged it too deep, but it looks like the difference between optimal algorithm and just picking the random combination that matches previous answers is not that big
 ill-be-waiting-outside: lol
 tutubalin: at least on the 2nd action the difference is like 0.001 bit
 ill-be-waiting-outside: hi

 wiznova: Hi&#160;:)trying to make sense of this solution in ruby (above), looks simple, but would would appreciate if someone could explain&#160;:)
 Maiwenn: join/ Lycée_saint_esprit
 DaNinja: I'm not familiar with ruby, but it looks like a regexp to find the index of the end of the line (length of the line)

 JLukeSkywalker: Come on people, stop approving clashes that have stubs that error and dont match the description or input given
 tutubalin: after clash you can leave a feedback
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, done, hopefully the bot removes it
 derjack: stop approving clashes (...). [solved]
 QueenRi: :rolling_eyes:
 vmelnyk: how to list all chat rooms?

 DaNinja: Did the Tank contribution get deleted? It looked like fun.
 ill-be-waiting-outside: can someone help me fine a simple code for C#
 ill-be-waiting-outside: plz
 AntiSquid: i guess it expired, ya just remembered about it DaNinja
 AntiSquid: along with other contribs
 tutubalin: ill-be-waiting-outside open Onboarding puzzle, switch to C#
 ill-be-waiting-outside: ok thanks i will try 
 DaNinja: a pity, hope the contributor resubmits it
 AntiSquid: there were other fancy games that disappeared
 tutubalin: that's the problem. cool stuff don't get enough approvements.messy cocs got approved.
 Astrobytes: A huge issue these days unfortunately&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: coc has high activity by comparison
 AntiSquid: i guess i should test some of the games too and do my part :P
 AntiSquid: but if they are left as WIP then it doesn't matter
 Astrobytes: Before they get approved and you need to change a rule you mean? :P
 tutubalin: hard puzzles are also hard to get approvement, as there should be at least 3 person who can solve them
 Astrobytes: That's something else that bugs me, approving without solving. I mean, why
 AntiSquid: read comments on fireworks, i had something to complain about from the start, the disclaimer was it's not supposed to be an exact copy of hanabi, but then that one error penalty was too much to not complain
 Astrobytes: Yeah I read them, wasn't having a go&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: and not sure how easily that would have been picked up in testing without strong opponents
 Astrobytes: That's why we try to test thoroughly, sometimes there just aren't enough people though
 AntiSquid: all 3 testers should have strong bots in some cases 
 darkhorse64: The rule change did not seem to change anything or people were tired
 AntiSquid: it did change
 darkhorse64: same rps on top 5
 AntiSquid: but then others changed their bots accordingly so ranks are still about the same :P
 Astrobytes: Ergo, nothing really changed :P
 AntiSquid: because those top 5s and more adjusted
 darkhorse64: I did not change my bot even though taking risks at the end may sometimes help me score more
 AntiSquid: would have kept my #2 otherwise
 AntiSquid: if you look further down you see some resubmits, i doubt those guys didn't change
 AntiSquid: unless i made my bot worse while making it better :thinking:
 darkhorse64: People seem to have hit a ceiling. 
 AntiSquid: opti submit limitation is very frustrating i must say
 darkhorse64: I should get back to it and replay games step by step to look for bugs
 darkhorse64: but it's very time consuming
 AntiSquid: i don't have much left on my TODO, there are some important things to add but not sure it changes too much about the bot, maybe 2 spots or 3
 AntiSquid: alternative is to add new league with rainbows and maybe even black cards, but that might just make things more random
 darkhorse64: We need new people with fresh ideas
 AntiSquid: you really ran out of ideas?
 QueenRi:  
 darkhorse64: I have one left for game start and I have some gut feeling that my endgame sucks a bit. Otherwise, I do not feel like predicting other players too deep (like I know that you know that I know)
 darkhorse64: That said, if you look how close are scores, a tiny improvement may pay well
 AntiSquid: missing only 211 CP on it :P
 AntiSquid: don't care enough
 darkhorse64: Yep, I should try to get more legends but I have more fun with game boards. 
 kovi: i still have some todos which can have effect within top
 darkhorse64: You are welcome
 Ordonnateur: Why isn't there character amount offset balance in clash of code for shortest code&#160;?
 jacek: huh
 Ordonnateur: quite unfair when you don't use python3
 jacek: then start using python3
 Ordonnateur: Why is there access to other language in the mode so&#160;? x)
 darkhorse64: bash, php, ruby, js are strong contenders for shortest
 jacek: at the risk of repeating myself, use right tool for right task
 AntiSquid: quite unfair i can't fight with a butter knife against a swords
 Ordonnateur: Yeah, I didn't had enough gold to buy excalibur to the shop keeper &gt;&lt;' the dev failed to balance gold income &lt;3
 KelvinAndHubbles:  depends on how frozen the butter is
 darkhorse64: sharpen your knife
 Scarfield: soften your butter
 AntiSquid: oic, lol was typing too fast ...ya didn't mean to say a knife made of butter
 jrke: so finally you ate butter or not?
 AntiSquid: goat's butter
 acuto: sakyk sakau
 AntiSquid: wiskas gerai
 acuto: jus visi saugus
 AntiSquid: aciu
 pardouin: pick one among python, JS, ruby, perl, php and learn it, these are widely used languages so you might need it at some point anyway
 tutubalin: Ruby almost always beats Python in codegolf.
 tutubalin: JS sometimes beats. Python has strong shortcuts like sum, ranges, string multiplication
 tutubalin: JS has short ternary operator, arrow functions, relaxed typing and it doen't depend on spaces that much
 tutubalin: if task is about numbers, JS is cool as converting string to int is either not required at all, or as short as 1 character
 tutubalin: if task is about strings,escpecially ASCII art puzzles, then Python is great
 tutubalin: but both lose to Ruby
 Tobeqz: wait how do you convert string to int in 1 character
 ZeyadShaban: I'm horrible at those coding challenges, but I love them :D
 struct: +
 struct: a="5"+a = becomes int
 struct: or float or w/e js uses
 Stephen10121: does that work in python?
 struct: dont think so
 Westicles: Is python best for unicode compression?  You always see exec(bytes('浩潰瑲洠瑡
 pardouin: ruby is equivalent
 pardouin: and js too
 pardouin: all 3 have the same tradeoff ~25-26 chars
 pardouin: and actually perl would be the best of them all if it had good char compression but unfortunately it hasn't
 tutubalin: Stephen10121 in Python: a=int(b)in JS: a=+bSo this is the case when JS wins
 Stephen10121: oh ok thanks
 tutubalin: also in JS sometimes you don't need conversion at all. in Python:a=int(b)-int(c)in JS: a=b-c
 baguettes: a=b- -c for adding 
 baguettes: also coerces it in the process
 eulerscheZahl: blender crashed so hard that I had to hard-reset my machine. And all I wanted it do is change the color of an object&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: is it a big object with high detail?
 eulerscheZahl: it's the red die that shall become blue
 Passifi: blender has had my system freeze up countless times over the years be thankful if it doesn't happen everyday&#160;;) 
 eulerscheZahl: and it just happened again. luckily I have an SSD
 eulerscheZahl: i'm thankful that I don't use blender on a regular basis
 eulerscheZahl: now i managed to change the value. but the die remains red
 eulerscheZahl: now it made some corrupted export that even changes the colors of other objects when I include it in the CG viewer
 AntiSquid: idk creating the cube shouldn't take too long, just redo it? 
 eulerscheZahl: it's a die, not a cube
 eulerscheZahl: with numbers and roundings
 eulerscheZahl: and i no nothing about blender
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i think i exported lights too :D
 jacek: cant you change the color in js side?
 eulerscheZahl: finally i was fast enough to get it done before it crashed again <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/yvEDrY0">https://imgur.com/a/yvEDrY0</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i also have a green version but somehow that doesn't look nice
 eulerscheZahl: too bright
 jacek: is this game like EinStein würfelt nicht?
 jrke: wow looks nice, which game?
 eulerscheZahl: no, jacek
 eulerscheZahl: loosely based on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.braillespiel.de/index.php?title=W%C3%BCrfelschach">http://www.braillespiel.de/index.php?title=W%C3%BCrfelschach</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can roll a die by exactly as many cells as the number on top shows at the beginning of your turn
 eulerscheZahl: when you end your move on an opponent die, it's taken out of game
 AntiSquid: there might be a reason it's only 7 instead of 8 dice in the original
 eulerscheZahl: the original has a totally different goal
 jacek: give it to ms to figure out balance
 eulerscheZahl: 3 dice in a row with consecutive numbers showing at the top. no capturing at all
 AntiSquid: nvm then
 eulerscheZahl: also: try to find a 7x7 chessboard asset :P
 AntiSquid: would probably edit the 8x8 image you have or another ones, to cut out 1 row 1 column and then import that into blender, use extrude to make it have same 3D shape as your board
 eulerscheZahl: or scale up the center part of the tecture
 eulerscheZahl: btw the chess board i downloaded came along with a 30MB texture :oI compressed it to 370kB
 AntiSquid: must be hard wood
 jrke: is there any way i can erase all tooltips just by calling one function
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: especially if you want to stick to standard SDK
 eulerscheZahl: btw CG SDK v4 is out, give it a try (i haven't tested it either yet)
 eulerscheZahl: main change: pixi 4.8 to pixi 5.3

 jacek: YurkovAS yes
 struct: buckybaugh507 try 80 thrust
 buckybaugh507: ok
 YurkovAS: jacek oh. i'm use mcts, increase performance to 50-100k rollouts (200k expand all childs), but still 13 place :thinking:
 jacek: what was before
 buckybaugh507: its to slow struct
 buckybaugh507: it was 97 jacek
 struct: have you followed the tutorial?
 struct: What league are you at?
 buckybaugh507: tea twice

 buckybaugh507: i am at curently at league Wood 2
 jrke: why after importing tooltip my game server doesn't show anything except grey screen
 jrke:&#160;?
 struct: js error check console
 struct: bucky do that if else that is shown on the tutorial
 buckybaugh507: yes it wont let me start the game it says that i have been eliminated
 AntiSquid: tough luck then
 struct: well you need to write the code
 struct: with python or w/e language you are using
 AntiSquid: read the statement again
 buckybaugh507: Python 3
 buckybaugh507: sorry i just started codeing whith python be cause i just started coding lol
 AntiSquid: all i am saying is read more carefully what is expected
 struct: if nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90 or nextCheckpointAngle &lt; -90:
 struct: soemthing like that
 struct: x should be nextcheckpointX
 struct: and y nextcheckpointY
 struct: thrust = 100
 struct: before the if 
 buckybaugh507: ok but i dont know what it all mean's
 buckybaugh507: because i just started coding
 struct: ah
 struct: This might not be the best place to start
 AntiSquid: then learn python syntax
 buckybaugh507: ok
 buckybaugh507: thx
 jacek: :snake:
 AntiSquid: there's something like ruby knight game for coding and it's far more basic
 AntiSquid: or that codecombat thingy kids use
 jacek: or minecraft :v
 AntiSquid: code a nes emulator in minecraft
 buckybaugh507: ok thx i will try all of them
 exor: Hey guys, I see you are kinda helpfull tonight? :D

 Kitkat260: hi
 buckybaugh507: hey do any of you guys play video games
 AntiSquid: -3*velocity exor
 Kitkat260: i do
 Kitkat260: i play robloux
 buckybaugh507: like fortnite or apex cs:go roblox
 buckybaugh507: rocket league
 jrke: try trig  and make your pod thrust 0 and target towars next to next checkpoit if you can cross next checkpoint even after getting affected by friction
 jrke: and yes the golden formula -3*vel
 AntiSquid: do this in minecraft: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nViIUfDMJg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nViIUfDMJg</a> or in roblox
 jrke: for my tooltip problem console  looks ok tooltips are also getting showed in logs but the server ......
 exor: jrke, yeah thats what I already see from the bosses pathing. -3 "times" vel? I understand correctly?
 jacek: -3vel is kind of internal meme
 AntiSquid: some new guy wrecking the opti puzzle&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/ddf32b1df24e02ea562b15f859da5e747039493">https://www.codingame.com/profile/ddf32b1df24e02ea562b15f859da5e747039493</a>

 jrke: yup just subtract 3 times of your current velocity to the position of your next checkpoint and make it target and its enough to make you in gold
 struct: not a new guy
 buckybaugh507: you live in japan
 AntiSquid: when did he join lol
 jrke: damn 2nd,1st,1st in optim and no other activity
 AntiSquid: he even has level 700 and in crypto-miner opti
 jacek: where you can see his optis?
 lexicons: is -3vel just a cheap pid loop lol
 lexicons: *pd
 struct: you can click on his profile
 struct: then ranking
 struct: then optimization
 buckybaugh507: antisquid that to hard
 jacek: ah
 jrke: click on ranking you will see a detailed view
 AntiSquid:&#160;??? buckybaugh507 @_@
 buckybaugh507: the mincraft thing

 jacek: oh my
 buckybaugh507: hey where you guys go
 kovi: that looks very professional euler!
 Tobeqz: The dice have a very high poly count, is that really necessary?
 AntiSquid: maybe you can scale it down if it's slow? 
 AntiSquid: smaller objects zoom further in :P
 Tobeqz: I just wasted 4 hours of my time implementing the wrong solution for the weekly puzzle&#160;;-;;;;
 AntiSquid: ya it happens&#160;:/
 Tobeqz: well at least I learned a lot
 AntiSquid: is it completely wrong? can you do a few tweaks?
 Tobeqz: Well it works but it's not optimized enough
 Tobeqz: And I doubt there's a way to make any significant improvements
 Tobeqz: Apart from using a completely different approach
 pardouin: there's a formula that directly links the number of inside points to something easier to compute

 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: why?
 MadKnight: this was the first time today when i had to put my mask on to buy stuff in a shop
 MadKnight: and what about u guys? are u already near at the point where u gonna get fees for randomly not having mssk all the time&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: muck fasks
 AntiSquid: well yeah otherwise it escalates into a senseless argument, too many retards out there
 Nektar24: we must wear masks everywhere here , not just inside shops&#160;:/
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a theory
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I found anomalies in the EPA air quality data in nov. of 2019 in miami and NY
 AntiSquid: i have to see them stop BLM protests once! ONCE!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: radiation levels spiked
 AntiSquid: in London police is guarding Churchill's statue, does nobody read history anymore? really? trying to take down Churchill? good they have their salute
 PatrickMcGinnisII: covid symptoms resemble short-term rad exposure, especially int he lungs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It would explain alot of other different stuff
 AntiSquid: doubt, but chernobyl documentary says it's possible
 AntiSquid: PatrickMcGinnisII i don't see anyone else mention radiation anywhere, nobody, not mainstream, not alternative news media
 PatrickMcGinnisII: china had rocket w/ reactor on-board explode earlier in nov.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: No one even tried using a geiger counter anywhere... why not?
 AntiSquid: then why do they want you to wear a mask? lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: air quality data shows it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's 3 common isotopes that decay in under 100 days
 AntiSquid: if it's radiation, what's the vaccine for? (granted a lot of EU countries halted the oxford vaccine due to blood clots)
 Nachosauce: what did air quality look like in spain during the outbreak?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's not even a real vacc., it's a keep the cell busy medicine.
 AntiSquid: and the allergic reactions few people have? you don't get that from a placebo 
 AntiSquid: also wuhan discos were opened up last i checked
 AntiSquid: no masks required
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Locally here, tanker trucks came into the port in january 2020, the chems were loaded into mosquito repellant trucks in an attempt to bind with some foreign isotopes and make them heavier and more-likely to wash away.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I am the only one who even reports any of this crap
 AntiSquid: my theory: things are a bit strange in america since they made lots of enemies
 AntiSquid: all the guards around DC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well 3 countries have dragonfire platforms
 PatrickMcGinnisII: stuff is strange
 AntiSquid: the laser turrets&#160;? those are awesome
 AntiSquid: i mean the technology itself
 PatrickMcGinnisII: was developed in UK, powered by nuclear...in orbit...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: specs were doable 3 years ago, I think China just caught up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I would worry about nerve damage from vaccines
 AntiSquid: you said they are not real did you not?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they do stuff, but not the thing they say they are
 AntiSquid: sure, they don't work as advertised
 AntiSquid: reason why some countries halted vaccination
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Nerve cells need a high xfer thru cell wall...vacc. hinders it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's a true dumbing down of society, watch the global IQ fall over the next couple years
 AntiSquid: no idea what vaccines you have in US, but like all vaccines i am sure some of the components are questionable
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well I almost died when I had to get vacc. for college, I'm allergic to all of them...so I opt out anyways.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I almost bought a geiger counter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's a conspiracy theory I know, but i can prove alot of it...the air data is there... but i haven't found anyone do a statistical model of it.  It's obvious to me just using excel stat tools - but I'm not a PhD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: We are in a solar minima, so the spikes in rads can't be explained away with 'the sun did it'
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The EPA is a joke anyways
 AntiSquid: that term is very confusing, reason i don't use it, see there are theories about conspiracies that turned out to be true
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll shut up
 Nektar24: help it is 3am and i can't sleep xd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: But.  if you compare the r -factor and actual death data in Scotland...they don't correlate.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's the only good data i can find from any area
 AntiSquid: Nektar24 it's 1 am here, i tell you what i will do, i simply go to bed close my eyes ... eventually i fall asleep :P
 Nektar24: D:
 Nektar24: D&#160;:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Do yall get fines for non-masking?
 AntiSquid: i don't know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I seen some videos, but wasn't sure
 AntiSquid: nothing surprises me
 AntiSquid: PatrickMcGinnisII then why does UK have some of the strictest lockdown regulations and why did they still allow inbound flights for a long period&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: if it's radiation i mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Lady had a meltdown last year on me for not standing back 6 feet... it's really dumb out there.  I'm like...I was wearing better stuff than her.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and I'm suquestered more than ANYONE i know
 AntiSquid: ya lots of hysterical folks
 Hakai47: Hi!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I dunno, I'm not a covid denier per-se ... but the upper respiratory disease data (flu) and pneumonia are like 0
 AntiSquid: covid is the cure to flu obviously lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the actual death rate in my county is only .001% above normal, which is within stat. norms
 AntiSquid: covid is real but people not being allowed to openly talk about the details is unreal ...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: governor got in trouble for changing the data, but instead...they put the data analyst in jail
 AntiSquid: i mean unimaginable 
 AntiSquid: move to florida :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so I get data direct from county, so no one here at least should be freaking out.  NO ONE I know personally has had covid
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they report positivity...but it's not a reliable test ... complete waste of time
 Westicles: Everyone anyone knows who died was dying anyway.  The whole thing is a giant hoax
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the state of Florida has only done 300 real anti-body tests (that only report the family of virus)...and the positivity rate was still only 38%.  And the medical examiners never test the dead.
 AntiSquid: not entirely true, some folks died on ventilators and they were healthy 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a fam. member who works in an ICU ward
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they started turning the patients on their stomachs who were on vents and the death rate went down right away...yup, vents kill people...and vents used poorly kill even more
 PatrickMcGinnisII: people were drowning from neglegence
 PatrickMcGinnisII: patient advocates have been blocked from hospitals
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So, why wear a mask?  because if you get the flu...and go to a hospital... you are rolling the dice.  So i wear a mask when in big stores, not small ones.  and it's kewl AF with dragons on it.&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: was considering to get a mask like this lol <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5c/99/f6/5c99f6934075e15743fa63a2d733c373.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5c/99/f6/5c99f6934075e15743fa63a2d733c373.jpg</a>
 AntiSquid: i like the design / concept
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omfg, little intense for me and can't wear a hat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I actually have n95 masks.  I mfgd. face shields on my laser for the local hospital for awhile
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no n95 masks anywhere there
 DaNinja: safecast.org has been doing does continuous rad monitoring since Fufkushima
 AntiSquid: and what are the reports like&#160;?
 DaNinja: havent seen any concerns raised 
 AntiSquid: PatrickMcGinnisII ya it is intense, that's the point, was thinking if i have to wear one, make it as obnoxious as possible
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx DaNinja, not alot of stations tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My gf has to wear one everyday...so hers all have cats on them
 AntiSquid: they gave out some rainbow masks at my job lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mine...dragons... dude told me I was a sheep for wearing a mask...I'm like... I'm cooler than you
 Nektar24: :p
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't wear one if people wouldn't be so anal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like i said... a common cold could get you in deep doodoo, so... idgaf
 Westicles: The propaganda guys did a brilliant job early on of getting people to declare you a nutter/ignorant if you compare it to a bad flu year.  Because that is exactly the correct comparison
 AntiSquid: in UK it's mostly about people getting free money from gov basically :P 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wear one, don't wear one...but I do laugh at alot of people wearing like feminine napkins on their face
 AntiSquid: not much protesting
 Westicles: a medium bad flu year, not one of the really bad ones
 AntiSquid: biden could learn something from UK if he wants to shut people up
 AntiSquid: just pay the stimulus already haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl, he just dropped $2800 in my acct.
 AntiSquid: he did&#160;?
 AntiSquid: so they did pay eventually&#160;? 2800 for 6 months&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so it's like $5 for big pharma and 5 cents for you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: They spending too much $
 AntiSquid: really? last i had a long discussion about US debt with people who also live there, they told me "but america owns money to itself so everything is under control"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My business took a dive, so I have to sell a rental property.  but they didn't lift the eviction ban until dec.31st... so I don't need the $, but I know alot of people do
 AntiSquid: federal reserve is private afaik
 PatrickMcGinnisII: We americans are slaves, all our 'must buy' stuff like food are inflated all to hell
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The credit card will expire someday soon and everyone has guns... so ...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I found a spot in Costa Rica that I could hang out... but they don't have internet, rofl
 Westicles: The idea that you can have infinite debt if you owe it to yourself is very popular these days.  I suspect one day they will pull some trickery with off-planet real estate/mineral rights to zero it all out anyway
 PatrickMcGinnisII: US can just do a patent-sale and make it all back
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but they gonna keep that DOD stuff on lock as long as they can
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I got fam works for DARPA, they say they got stuff that would totally elliminate capitalism altogether
 AntiSquid: i follow Darpa news and youtube :Pthe stuff they do show to the public is interesting, like hardware that makes hacking harder ... 
 AntiSquid: anyways gn8, 2 am almost haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap 9pm, haven't done dinner
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf, nite

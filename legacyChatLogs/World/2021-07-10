 Calamiti: yo how do i proceed to the next step in coders strike back?
 jacek: hm?
 Calamiti: like i am at the boost how can i unlock more of the commands?
 Calamiti: the next step/level
 jacek: you need to advance to next league
 jacek: submit your bot and he must be above boss in the leaderboard
 Calamiti: Ohhh ok got it thanks 
 Calamiti: so i must beat the boss?
 Calamiti: thats all?
 jacek: yes
 DaNinja: ez
 Calamiti: Got it thanks boys 
 jacek: well, be 1st in leaderboard. sometimes you can be better than boss, but worse than other players
 Calamiti: or girls who knows 
 Calamiti: wait do i have to beat all other players toooo?
 Calamiti: or just boss?
 DaNinja: aim to beat the boss
 Calamiti: kk

 CodeDecodeDev: Hello
 Xzoky174: hi
 punter147: hello, this is a question to the experts: how do you manage your entire source code of various puzzles and contests at codingame? there must be many common bits and pieces right? do you house all this in a big project like structure with subdirectories for the specific contest/puzzle?
 punter147: for example, for many puzzles on pathfinding, do you guys have a framework like code written already for one of the puzzles and just code up the specific changes(lets call it implementing the XNode (insert puzzle name in X))? 
 KiwiTae: punter147 do you boo ~
 KiwiTae: personally i got few templates i reuse
 KiwiTae: and ready to go classes
 punter147: KiwiTae i did not understand the first line? oh i see, coz i was just refactoring my codebase to neatly arrange the code in proper levels so i can reuse it next time very easily...
 KiwiTae: it saves time yesgood good
 Counterbalance: I have 1 project and git repo per multi / optim / codegolf / puzzle, and a 'shared lib' with reusable include files / snippets, but I usually write the algorithms from scratch so as to be optimized. I did have generic GA but it got pretty large with all the #ifdefs to suit the different multis&#160;:)
 Poostang: someone give me job I will iterate through various data structures and write algorithms for USD 50k per year, thanks
 darkhorse64: :laughing:
 MSmits: I think this is jordan schlansky
 MSmits: conan ended so he is looking for a job
 darkhorse64: asking here to get paid for writing code when we do it for leisure :rofl:
 MSmits: yep
 jacek: Oo
 Astrobytes: OldJohn: Touché. Did you book me in Oware?
 jacek: why would someone want to book you
 Astrobytes: Some of us fight battles in the peasant positions.
 jacek: sorry didnt notice. i needed to scroll down much
 MSmits: :fire:
 Astrobytes: :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: it's doubtful though Astrobytes
 MSmits: oware is very hard to book effectively
 Astrobytes: It was very, very specific.
 MSmits: check your games, see if you're playing deterministically or doing different starts
 Astrobytes: I've had to increase randomness to be able to beat him at all since his submit today.
 Astrobytes: When I tweaked mine the other day, it just happened to demolish him every time. Smells like vengeance :D
 MSmits: hmm could be
 MSmits: he did it in othello
 Astrobytes: I remember. I always enjoy jostling for placements, even if I'm not top 10
 MSmits: make sure you set your random seed based on time, not some fixed seed
 MSmits: on D&amp;B I was able to get a much higher WR if i wanted, against crazy remi
 MSmits: just by trying different random seeds and keeping the one with the highest WR
 MSmits: because his random seed was fixed
 jacek: thats weird for a guy that invented monte carlo tree search
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: lol right
 darkhorse64: yesterday, struct posted a snippet that made me realize that I was doing something wrong (= inefficient) in nearly all my mcts
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1370475619998392328">https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1370475619998392328</a>
 jacek: calculating log(parents) everytime?
 darkhorse64: doing ctz on masks followed by 1 &lt;&lt;
 MSmits: why is that wrong?
 struct: is not needed
 darkhorse64: because pdep gives you the mask
 struct: did it improve performance?
 MSmits: but you dont always use pdep do you?
 struct: on rollout I do
 MSmits: do you mean this darkhorse64
 MSmits: int safeCount = __builtin_popcountl(safeBoard);					int rnd = FastRand(safeCount);					uint64_t selectedBit = _pdep_u64(1ULL &lt;&lt; rnd, safeBoard);					int bit = __builtin_ctzl(selectedBit);
 darkhorse64: yes, slighly. On rollout, for selecting moves, you can also loop on bits with pdep(1, bits). Yes, MSmits
 MSmits: i dont know what i can leave out though
 MSmits: I also need the bit index for lookups
 MSmits: so i will need ctzl
 struct: bit index for lookup?
 darkhorse64: True, it depends on the multi, on C4 or bt I have no lookups
 MSmits: yes, to change various yavalath maps
 MSmits: to update them
 MSmits: they all have different masks depending on which hex you played
 MSmits: (for which you need the bit index)
 struct: Well now i shared most of my tricks
 MSmits: let me check if i do something weird in c4 then
 struct: it can be used in more games
 darkhorse64: anyway on C4, the vast majority of time is spent on getting winning moves
 darkhorse64: *my time*
 MSmits: int moveCount = __builtin_popcountl(allowed);		int rnd = FastRand(moveCount);		uint64_t selectedBit = _pdep_u64(1ULL &lt;&lt; rnd, allowed);		boards[player] |= selectedBit;
 MSmits: i am not doing ctzl here
 MSmits: so applying the 1 bit mask straight to the board
 darkhorse64: This is what I do now. The drawback of reusing too blindly
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yeah it happens
 struct: do you also update the move mask like I said darkhorse?
 MSmits: trying to fix a TT + ab negamax currently. it's tough
 MSmits: the TT stuff i mean
 jacek: youre using negamax? oO
 MSmits: yeah for D&amp;B
 jacek: what century is it
 darkhorse64: No, I found that computing it was faster than updating it. I agree it's a bit weird
 struct: so you calculate it everytime you make a move?
 darkhorse64: yes
 struct: wasnt faster for me
 struct: ah maybe it is similar
 struct: I get around same rollouts so maybe my way is not faster
 darkhorse64: Just looking at ops count, your code seems faster. 
 MSmits: jacek as you said, D&amp;B is all or nothing, so you need a full solve. Don't know what else to use&#160;:)
 MSmits: could do mcts with solver, but TT's are extra strong in this game
 MSmits: so negamax has the advantage
 Rddevelop: does anyone know about the "polindrome substrings perfect word" clash of code game and if so can you share the best solution?
 BlaiseEbuth: Indeed! Just the time to remind me the good one between the 1200+ clashs, that I've of course perfectly memorized. And I give you the answer... :smirk:
 jdsigg: Blaise you have seen duplicate clashes before?
 BlaiseEbuth: A lot. Since the guidelines don't forbid them.
 BlaiseEbuth: And just like that, without the statement, I doubt that anybody can just throw up the solution...
 BlaiseEbuth: If he even wanted to...
 BugKiller_328: how are you!
 BugKiller_328: I learned FlatMC.what I have to learn for the next step between these 2.    MCTS VS MiniMax.Any suggestion&#160;?
 byteful: put ur favorite programming language below
 struct: minimax might be easier to learn
 BugKiller_328: learn minimax first and then goto MCTS&#160;?
 struct: yeah
 BugKiller_328: Thanks for your suggestion @struct.
 BugKiller_328: now I'm trying to make plan for about 40 days.
 struct: depends on what you want to do
 BugKiller_328: so wanted to know the thing I need to learn (4 ~ 5 algorithm in order easy to hard)
 jacek: there is so much to minimax (and alphabeta) and mcts that it will suffice for a while
 jacek: so many modifications and enhancements to them
 BugKiller_328: learned FlatMC and understood about it and had fun. so want to learn more and more.
 BugKiller_328: @jacek: so minimax, mcts is enough for a while&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: what is alphabeta though&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: sorry for dummy question&#160;;)
 jacek: enhancement to minimax. learn minimax first, then alpha-beta. it prunes a lot moves so you can search much deeper
 BugKiller_328: I got it. I'll ask again after learning that things.
 Counterbalance: You could also take a quick peek at SA and GA; they are just modifications of 'FlatMC'
 BugKiller_328: Thanks a lot for your suggestion.
 BugKiller_328: SA and GA&#160;? Can you write the full text instead of abbreviation for me&#160;?
 jacek: simulated annealing and genetic algorithm
 Counterbalance: simulated annealing and genetic algor..
 Counterbalance: dang&#160;:)
 jacek: slowpoke
 Counterbalance: It's the weekend&#160;:)
 BugKiller_328: ah.. sorry :D
 BugKiller_328: weekend is just good for me for the self development. but sorry to ask much&#160;:)
 jacek: its alright&#160;:+1:
 Counterbalance: Asking is good
 Counterbalance: btw, smits mentioned 'TT' before - what's that?
 Astrobytes: BugKiller_328: Counterbalance was just responding to jacek with the 'weekend' thing, don't worry&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Transposition tables Counterbalance
 Counterbalance: ah thanks astro
 Counterbalance: TMA - too many acronyms&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: right :D
 jacek: eeyup
 BugKiller_328: You all who's on top in ranking here are just AI engineers&#160;?
 jacek: for ai stuff im just hobbyist. at work i make apps for android, not much ai there
 Counterbalance: Nah just doing it for fun - job is not as interesting as AI
 Astrobytes: Not too many AI/ML only people, you have inoryy (anyone seen him recently btw?), I think Wontonimo and a few others
 eulerscheZahl: I just stack different layers of incompetence and ignorance on top of each other

 BugKiller_328: I've tried few bot programming and just wondered how this makes visualization of battle for so many bot programming problems..
 BugKiller_328: (how this website makes visualization..)
 Astrobytes: There is an SDK, it's in Java and utilises JS
 eulerscheZahl: in the end it's pixi.js
 BugKiller_328: so, if someone makes a problem, he needs to make the visualization with sdk&#160;?

 emh: hmm.. would be fun to work for Google Deepmind. anyone here work for them? I wonder if my CodinGame ranking would be sufficient to get hired haha
 MSmits: just show them your special csb version
 Astrobytes: inoryy does emh but I haven't seen him around recently
 Astrobytes: MSmits :rofl:
 emh: lol
 Astrobytes: Job guaranteed
 BugKiller_328: I'm working as full-stack web dev but I want to be good enough in algorithm.. :thinking:
 BugKiller_328: spending time by solving something here will make me archive my goal/hope&#160;?
 Astrobytes: BugKiller_328: I don't even work in a dev-related field so all you have to is keep building your knowledge and I'm sure you'll get there in the end
 Astrobytes: *have to do
 jacek: to be frank i havent done any heavy algorithm related stuff at work
 MSmits: BugKiller_328 nowhere better to be
 BugKiller_328: :yum:
 BugKiller_328: happy to hear..
 BugKiller_328: can anyone list here most practical algorithms used a lot, (or good to know ..)
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: genetic algorithm, various sorts of neural networks
 MSmits: minimax/negamax
 Rddevelop: in work you dont need to be good at algorithm
 jacek: BFS, DFS, minimax, mcts, GA/SA, NN
 MSmits: monte carlo treesearch
 jacek: jacekmax :v
 Rddevelop: i work for a company that is involved in the photovoltaic sector, we have to develop calculations for solar profitability and best inverters calculation and even there you dont need to be an expert in algorithims
 MSmits: oh cool, I teach a class on solar 
 BugKiller_328: :disappointed_relieved:
 MSmits: about 8 weeks
 MSmits: pretty basic stuff though
 BugKiller_328: then algorithm is just hobby thing for even developer&#160;?
 MSmits: not all developers, just most of them
 jacek: MSmits you teach them photosyntesis?
 Rddevelop: thats cool smits
 MSmits: no i teach them about solar cells
 KiwiTae: algorithm design is most of my job lol
 MSmits: they do some experiments and we look at factors that maximize the power output
 MSmits: such as angle and resistance
 BugKiller_328: of course, I've worked so many years for webdev, and I didn't feel that I need to learn for algorithms in depth.but I feel more happy when I work something which needs a thought alot.  than just web-dev. lol.
 MSmits: Rddevelop you will probably understand this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/XnTwAO5">https://imgur.com/a/XnTwAO5</a>
 MSmits: same solar panel with a lamp at various distance
 MSmits: to find the optimum resistance
 MSmits: which moves with a smaller or greater light intensity
 MSmits: the less light, the higher the optimum resistance
 MSmits: students make these graphs in class
 Astrobytes: ah the good old days of classroom physics experiments. Not half as fun as chemistry tho' :P
 MSmits: well i dont blow anything up
 MSmits: (on purpose)
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 BugKiller_328: why chat history is not persist here&#160;? even for 1:1 chat.
 MSmits: there's a log for world chat somewhere

 Astrobytes: ^ chat log
 BugKiller_328: Cool, thanks.
 Rddevelop: MSmits very cool. we take into consideration things like tilt_gain, shadow losses module degradation, slowly making it more complex without risking the user usability regarding speed
 MSmits: good stuff
 MSmits: I guess this and an astrophyics course are the last 2 remains of my physics activities after the summer
 MSmits: other than that it's all computer science now
 Astrobytes: astrophysics more fun imo
 MSmits: yeah it sure is
 MSmits: we work on supermassive black holes
 Astrobytes: Man I wish we were doing that in highschool&#160;:)
 MSmits: me too, we didnt have anything like that either
 SubwayMan: does anyone know how to remove the tips/suggestions dialogs when code editing? they often cover my code so I can't see what I'm looking at
 jacek: i dont see any tips dialogs o.O
 Astrobytes: We did some basic black hole stuff but with what's now known... sheesh, woulda been amazing
 MSmits: SubwayMan if it keeps annoying you, you can always use a local editor and just copy paste for testing and there's also some send ing tool i think
 SubwayMan: yeah - usually it's just a hindrance but it can be really frustrating in activities like clash
 jacek: you get that in clash? i thought it was only onboarding or csb
 RoboStac: I think he means the code suggestion  things rather than the tip dialogs
 SubwayMan: yeahI'm talking about the suggestions/information dialog that can pop up
 jacek: from the IDE? oh
 RoboStac: as far as I know the only setting you can change for that is whether enter chooses the selection or not
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 SubwayMan: yeah I changed that
 Westicles: I have a new criteria for ranking which languages are best
 Astrobytes: shortest syntax and easy exec?
 jacek: :flag_pl:?
 Westicles: Those that understand /*/*/b*/r*y and those that don't
 jacek:  /b/, that brings some memories
 Westicles: The way to call ruby these days
 Astrobytes: insanity
 jacek: or php
 jacek: :F
 1zanie: hello world
 Rddevelop: php is cool, it has improved a lot
 MSmits: yay improvement
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/569569616">https://www.codingame.com/replay/569569616</a>
 MSmits: check solved scores from frame 45
 MSmits: I lose but because my old bot doesnt solve as well, it makes mistakes
 MSmits: and then I win
 MSmits: it's not enough to beat nr 1, but i'll take it
 jacek: oh my
 struct: does it win vs your current bot everytime?
 MSmits: not sure yet, but it can be improved a lot still
 MSmits: I am ignoring two important strategies and the search method nr 1 is using (still have to code that)
 struct: what is nr1 using?
 MSmits: chain counting
 MSmits: cheap way to know who has control over the endgame
 MSmits: as opposed to my calculating the exact optimum score
 MSmits: he considers a game where he ends up in control as a win, but there are exceptions. in those cases his "win" message is sometimes incorrect
 MSmits: so what i need to do is to take his method for earlier game and switch to my score-solving later on
 MSmits: should give me a small edge... but lots of coding left to do
 Marchete: why did you retake D&amp;B? It's just 1 place
 MSmits: because I like it, mostly and because I know what to do to be nr 1. If I was all about the cp I would do something else of course
 Marchete: then better do it now
 MSmits: how so
 Marchete: I prefer to be alone when I retake it :D
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Marchete: it seemed I did a lot of noise on Oware
 Marchete: and now it's changing each half day
 MSmits: sure, well, i'll be going on vacation at some point, so expect to take 2-3 weeks
 Marchete: don't worry
 Marchete: I'll retake it someday
 MSmits: whats changing&#160;?
 Marchete: leaderboard
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: doesnt have to be noise
 MSmits: rock paper scissors is pretty extreme with these nns
 MSmits: so whoever is submitting is doing this
 Marchete: pretty extreme indeed
 MSmits: btw, if you're interested, you can see how mikkla wins here:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/569573791">https://www.codingame.com/replay/569573791</a>
 MSmits: my solver says i win, but then mikkla does a sacrifice move and the score turns upside down
 MSmits: almost noone knows how to do proper sacrifice moves
 MSmits: it's just the top 4
 Marchete: he is very verbose
 Marchete: no one knows?
 MSmits: most of it is meaningless. All thats useful from his text is his "win" message
 Marchete: that's pretty common on papers
 MSmits: yes, I mean the players on the leaderboard dont know
 MSmits: they just fill up the board, giving away no boxes
 MSmits: until the endgame
 MSmits: also, even if you know it can be good, you need to figure out how to make your bot do it correctly. It's pretty messy
 Marchete: but then if we two read the papers
 Marchete: and apply all logic behind
 Marchete: it will be similar to mikla
 Marchete: I guess
 MSmits: we can do better I'm sure
 Marchete: I see it as as graph problem
 Marchete: with counting
 MSmits: I do too
 MSmits: well almost
 Marchete: early game it's "hard" to do something good
 MSmits: the endgame for me is a graph, the time before that is a bitboard
 Marchete: I thought about going to some kind of patterns
 Marchete: that I know they can be better for your player id
 MSmits: I think you can reliably gain control after frame 30 or so
 MSmits: miklla does it at 38 roughly
 Marchete: I see the Win msg
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats it
 Marchete: Win uppercase
 MSmits: what you do is, you write a function for a chain counter given an endgame
 MSmits: and then a negamax or mcts solver that searches till endgame
 MSmits: with TT and such
 MSmits: so thats about frame 55 when endgame starts
 MSmits: so he goes 17 deep, which seems really hard, but TT is strong here since you share the same board
 Marchete: with graphs many moves are pruned
 Marchete: you end with a couple of moves per graph
 MSmits: thats in the endgame, I am ignoring that completely
 MSmits: it's 1 function to calculate control
 MSmits: no search required
 MSmits: only if you want to know the exact score
 MSmits: your graph thingy is really useful to calculate the exact score. 
 MSmits: but mikla doesnt even do that
 MSmits: doesnt matter if you win 29-20 or 36-13 
 MSmits: (but there are rare cases)
 Marchete: I can cut 3 way graphs efficiently
 Marchete: that's not endgame
 MSmits: to me it is
 Marchete: ahh then yes
 MSmits: my solver starts working when there are no safe moves left and all moves give away boxes
 Marchete: ok
 MSmits: so that can include 4-ways and 3-ways
 MSmits: on average it can solve 1000 such boards per 100 ms
 MSmits: but they vary wildly in required calc time
 MSmits: but my point was, the entire board can be handled with a single function if you just want to know who ends up being in control and grabbing most of the boxes
 MSmits: so instead of 1000 such boards, you can solve 100x as many 
 MSmits: you still need to know how to actually play out the end game efficiently, so your graph thingy is still useful
 Marchete: I guess
 Marchete: it's also good for hashing
 Marchete: less similar boards
 MSmits: ohh, i have been wanting to know how to hash a graph
 MSmits: it seems complicated
 MSmits: btw my graph nodes are the 3-way and 4-way splits with links between them that just have a size. I dont keep the separate boxes
 MSmits: i guess it might be harder to hash a graph if the links also have a size
 Marchete: length, type etc
 Marchete: at some point it's an approximation
 Marchete: but I think it worked nicely
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: dont you have a way to check if the graph is equal&gt;
 MSmits: to find the right graph in your bucket, as it were..
 Marchete: doing it by hand
 MSmits: but whats the approximation then?
 MSmits: do you just mean you get some hash conflicts?
 Marchete: initial boards
 Marchete: with tons of strings
 MSmits: well I always get hash conflicts, thats fine
 MSmits: that happens with bitboards even
 MSmits: hash collisions was the word i was looking for
 Deekhann: hi
 Marchete: I think not
 Marchete: I mean I can't hash very well the boards with too many degrees
 MSmits: sure, that makes sense
 Marchete: but I do care about if an edge is on edge or not
 Marchete: it's important
 MSmits: I cant solve very well in that case

 MACKEYTH: A lot of ppl like RUst
 mathiasx: Perhaps I've missed something -- I'm trying to do one of the first "medium" puzzles, and it mentions being able to use STDERR. I'm not seeing stdout or stderr print anywhere, and each example just fails without output. How can I tell what's going on?
 juice0: to the right of console output is a drop down menu, make sure it's all checked
 mathiasx: It is, hasn't shown anything yet
 mathiasx: I've tried really basic stuff like just stderr logging at the beginning some text
 juice0: iirc even if i'm timing out or not reading all the input correctly, i can still see stderr and stdout
 juice0: unless it's not compiling
 mathiasx: Yeah, I now have it passing and there's no output
 mathiasx: I hate to say it, since it sounds like someone who doesn't know better, but I think this is broken.
 mathiasx: (The first example can be hardcoded, so it passes. No output shown.)
 juice0: it wouldn't be the first time
 mathiasx: I think that's where I'll have to call it a night; there's no way to make any progress in this without being able to debug the data at each step
 juice0: if it happens again later, say something in chat then.  there's usually someone around who knows more than me
 mathiasx: Thanks!

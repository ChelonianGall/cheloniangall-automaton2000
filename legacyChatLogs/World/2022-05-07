 DaNinja: mybk do you calc the average somewhere?
 mybk: no I am suming it
 DaNinja: use the average
 mybk: ah, the problem is the length of the table 
 mybk: yesterday I was seeing 3 in test case, I forgot it's varibale 
 mybk: newby error 
 mybk: anyway if I do the average, I will just divide the summation by the length of the table, so it's not going to make any difference (I think)

 waterproofsodium: also
 waterproofsodium: what is it with the fetish about code shortness?
 Zyk0: there's no fetish I think
 waterproofsodium: not sure if you get extrap points for it. but I noticed a lot people attempting to make their code as short as possible
 5DN1L: That's either the code golf section here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf</a>
 5DN1L: or the shortest mode in a clash of code
 jacek: disk storage is expensive nowadays
 DaNinja: and paper
 LaurensD: @waterproofsodium, there is a clash of code that is about shortness, yes. Also coding the most efficient way is a good thing right? make it more readable, easier* to maintain. etc. 
 waterproofsodium: optimizing for size&#160;!= improving readability &amp;&amp; improving efficiency
 waterproofsodium: in most cases
 waterproofsodium: anyways people may just do it for fun. I didn't get the big picture yet
 Zyk0: you did, they do it for fun
 Zyk0: It helps learning new things about a language too (that could be applied elsewhere than code golf)
 LaurensD: Well, it does give you idea's how you might do things different, I guess
 5DN1L: That's right
 waterproofsodium: fair enough
 Ayza: any good idea on how I would get the most wild mana?
 Ayza: It's always a tie between me and the boss but it ends up winning with the most wild mana lol
 waterproofsodium: ayza what problem you solving?
 Ayza: spring challenge 2022
 waterproofsodium: is it difficult?
 Ayza: It's leagues based so
 Ayza: wood league is pretty easy
 Wontonimo: which league Ayza&#160;?
 Ayza: bronze
 Wontonimo: i gathered a lot more wild by using wind to keep bugs outside of my base range
 Ayza: so the more spells you cast the more wild mana you get?
 Ayza: and it gotta be outside the radius of your base right?
 Wontonimo: no, read the details on the left
 Wontonimo: it's all there
 Wontonimo: you gather wild mana per hero per turn that is outside of a base
 Wontonimo: that's it.  it's not based on kills, or spells, or anything else
 Wontonimo: it is to encourage you to no camp in your base
 Ayza: oh I see, just keep my heroes outside the base
 Wontonimo: bingo
 Wontonimo: paste a replay link of you vs the boss
 Ayza: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/633182535">https://www.codingame.com/replay/633182535</a>
 struct: I would try pacifist until silver
 Wontonimo: waterproofsodium , you can get to bronze by simply downloading the example AIs that are in the description and adding a sort so that your heros attack the closest bugs first
 struct: and then make an attacker from there
 waterproofsodium: Ayza ^
 Wontonimo: Ayza , borrow an idea from soccer.  Have your heroes have positions, and each hero is responsible for the bugs closest to their position
 Wontonimo: your heroes are running around like 8yr olds playing soccer 
 Ayza: lol, I'll try that strategy 
 Ayza: thanks
 waterproofsodium: how long is that challenge still around, i may want to try it later
 Wontonimo: I tried 20 degrees, 45 degrees, and 80 degrees at a distance of 6000.
 Wontonimo: sort all spiders by distance to base
 LaurensD: which challenge? spring challenge it ended already
 LaurensD: you can keep playing 'spider attack'
 Wontonimo: then a particular hero is responsible for a bug if their camping point is closer to tthe bug than another hero.
 Ayza: right now I am saving all the spiders coordinates in a list then get the one closest to the base
 Ayza: which sounds like a bad idea
 waterproofsodium: i'm confused. seems like they're still doing it
 Wontonimo: no, that's pretty good Ayza
 Ayza: but I think that's the reason why my heroes are all attacking at once
 Ayza: because they are all going for the one closest to the base
 Wontonimo: a simple improvement would be for hero 0 to attack spider 0, hero 1 attack spider 1 etc.  that will spread them out but once a spider dies thenn they all runn around like idiots
 Ayza: sounds like a good idea
 LaurensD: does anyone know which c# framework is used for spider attack? 
 struct: C# framework?
 LaurensD: .net framework
 struct: C# 8.0
 struct: net core 3.1.3
 5DN1L: waterproofsodium It was originally a limited-time contest, now it's turned into an all-time bot-programming game, so you can play it any time
 LaurensD: Thanks
 LaurensD: @struct
 Ophen: @5DN1L what is the badge near ur name
 5DN1L: hover over it
 5DN1L: and you'll see
 Wontonimo: hey Ayza , here is a replay of mine.  I'm in the lower right.  Notice how my heroes seem to have a camp point, and they only attack the bug that is closest to their camp point
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/632964234">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/632964234</a>
 Wontonimo: and if a bug is too close to the base, wind it away
 Wontonimo: just that will get you to gold
 Wontonimo: gotta go.  Good luck
 Ayza: Thanks! I'll look at the replay
 Ayza: goodbye
 waterproofsodium: 5DN1L cool
 struct: meh cant find any board to my liking and the graphics look so pixelated when I draw the triangles
 jacek: and still no models for dices?
 MimmoFlow: Could you guys recommend me a bot programming challenge not too difficult for a novice please?
 struct: jacek for dices I will just use a number
 struct: lol
 Quidome: MimmoFlow Tulips and Daisies is an idea
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tulips-and-daisies">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tulips-and-daisies</a>
 struct: are you still doing coif Quidome?
 Quidome: yep working on it now
 Quidome: doing a few more heuristics and try to get into gold.
 Quidome: but already far more work than getting into silver :P
 Quidome: I think I need search of some kind but not decided on that yet. 
 Quidome: Sim is more complicated than I like
 struct: yeah Im not sure how to progress yet
 struct: I want to do bitboard but Ill need to create my own for it
 struct: instead of using uint64
 struct: since it doesnt fit it
 Quidome: interesting it doesn't fit in a i128 either...
 struct: yeah
 Quidome: hm...
 struct: but bitboards are not needed for legend
 Quidome: ok, don't it then :D
 struct: I could use bitset&lt;&gt;
 Quidome: youre doing C++ right?
 struct: yes
 Quidome: what is bitset?
 struct: it optimizes based on the size of bits you need
 Quidome: ah, ok
 struct: so if you do bitset&lt;192&gt; it will probably create an array of 3 uint64
 struct: and you can do normal bit operations oin it
 waterproofsodium: can you do bitset&lt;191&gt;?
 struct: yes
 waterproofsodium: does it throw if you access index 191?
 struct: no
 waterproofsodium: (the index that is out of range)
 struct: ah
 struct: No idea I dont really use it
 Quidome: if you put an envelope around the board to accommodate a void border you need 196 bits 
 struct: 13*12 is enough Quidome
 therealbeef: bitset has small downside of not supporting arithmetic operations though
 Quidome: why 13*12 and not 14*14?
 struct: because bottom and top is irrelevant on bitboards
 struct: 0b1110 &gt;&gt; 4 will just return 0
 Quidome: so you rotate to move in the other axis?
 Quidome: nm I have to look into this subject one day
 Quidome: but not now
 Quidome: :D
 struct: yeah its simple to understand but I cant explain it well
 waterproofsodium: btw are &gt;&gt; operations across programming languages the same? (provided they use same underlying datatype)
 waterproofsodium: should all be done by CPU correct?
 jacek: welp java has &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;
 Rishavv: hello
 Quidome: hi\
 Quidome: hi
 Quidome: struct i find it hard to get optimal movement without search maybe I do a DFS of optimal movement of my troops within a turn
 struct: Yeah I dont know what ill do yet
 struct: im not good on these types of games
 Quidome: what are your favorite games?
 eulerscheZahl: still playing ice and fire?
 Quidome: yep
 eulerscheZahl: one of my favorite games here together with hypersonic
 eulerscheZahl: unpopular opinion but i also liked the pacman contest very much
 eulerscheZahl: despite fog, not because of it
 Quidome: pacman wass cool indeed

 ElCimici: it works but why
 derjack: removes white characters (space etc.) from the end of string
 ElCimici: aaaaa
 ElCimici: thanls
 ElCimici: thanks
 derjack: and beginning too i think
 KunDragon: hello
 jacek: ohai
 Quidome: eulerscheZahl
 Quidome: do you use search on coif?
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree
 eulerscheZahl: to find paths that cut off an opponent area and to build a kill chain (or to prevent the opponent doing so)

 eulerscheZahl: and and the hungarian algorithm, i already forgot about that part again
 ElCimici: how can i get last character of a string in c++
 ElCimici: i tried string[string.length()]
 ElCimici: but dosen't work
 Adsonmin: length - 1
 Ayza: not a c++ programmer, but aren't you supposed to do string.length()-1?
 ElCimici: thanks
 ElCimici: u right
 Andriamanitra: @ElCimici std::string also has .back() method that gets the last character
 ElCimici: thx
 Andriamanitra: also i would advise you to use .at() method rather than indexing because [] can cause undefined behavior
 Quidome: eulerscheZahl thnxs for the link very helpfull! :D
 eulerscheZahl: much more detailed than what i can write 4 years after
 eulerscheZahl: 3 years
 jacek: brainfrog?
 Ayza: thanks a lot Wontonimo, your tips helped a lot
 Ayza: couldn't beat the boss but atleast got first ranking somehow

 waterproofsodium: also does clash ever become more difficult? doesn't look like it. but still asking
 5DN1L: i guess it's random
 waterproofsodium: ah ok
 5DN1L: and for scoring i believe it's based on trueskill

 nightwalkerinthedark: hh
 waterproofsodium: nightwalkerinthedark your name is definitely composed from too many words
 waterproofsodium: strange.. usually when I make a random silly comment I get a taco
 nightwalkerinthedark: :expressionless:
 Defiines: mmmm taco
 nightwalkerinthedark: lol
 picoplankton: so, what does this code in java doe&#160;?:
 ASM_MOV_INT: variable names can never have too many words, besides his name is only 2 more words than your name
 picoplankton: do
 Defiines: seed &amp; 0x10 is a bitwise and, basically will 1 if second bit of seed is 1...
 ASM_MOV_INT: seed &amp; 0x10 is the hardest part? doesn't that do a binary AND with seed and 0x10
 ASM_MOV_INT: bitwise is what i meant
 Defiines: indeed
 Defiines: so if seed is 10010, will return 1, meaning value will be 4
 struct: 0x10 is 16
 struct: which is 0b10000
 Defiines: ah lol I messed the ox
 struct: any number that has a matching bit in the 5th position will not be 0
 Defiines: you're correct
 picoplankton: so, is this the same as this in python&#160;?value = self.seed &amp; int(16)
 picoplankton: what about the second part  0&#160;? 2 :4
 picoplankton: that;'s a really weird statemetn
 struct: picoplankton
 struct: ternary operator
 struct: a = false&#160;? 1&#160;: 2; a will take value of 2
 struct: a = true&#160;? 1&#160;: 2; a will take value of 1
 struct: maybe with parenthesis is less confusing
 struct: a = (true&#160;? 1&#160;: 2)
 picoplankton: what does the question mark do&#160;?
 picoplankton: 1:2 = 0.5
 picoplankton: that's probably not java synthax
 picoplankton: but my point is I don't understand the operators

 picoplankton: thanks&#160;!
 struct: np
 picoplankton: though I still don't get it; 
 picoplankton: oh wait
 picoplankton: (seed &amp; 0x10) == 0
 struct: yeah
 picoplankton: so, is this:int spawnIndex = freeCells.get((int) seed&#160;% freeCells.size())the same as this:spawnIndex = self.seed&#160;% len(empties)
 picoplankton: to java; bottom python
 struct: the first doesnt seem to return the index
 struct: but the object
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: coming to prep for interviews
 picoplankton: its assigned to an integer
 struct: freeCells.get(
 struct: freeCells its an arrayList right?

 Darleanow: Hello guys just a quick question
 Darleanow: if a male of somthing weights 20% more it is w/100*20+w right
 Darleanow: BUT 
 Darleanow: its given the female weight
 Darleanow: if we do it in the other way, taking example of a male which weights 120, 20% of it should give 96 not 100 right&#160;?
 picoplankton: if male is 20% more than the male is 1.2x female; so female is W/1.2
 Darleanow: OH THANKS
 picoplankton: 1.2f=m  &lt;=&gt; f=m/1.2
 picoplankton: right&#160;?
 Darleanow: yeah that's right&#160;!
 Darleanow: i though u had to remove 20% of her weight

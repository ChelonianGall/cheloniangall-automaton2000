 eulerscheZahl: Dilbert
 WOLFRAHH: hi eulerscheZahl
 WOLFRAHH: Automaton2000: join plz
 Automaton2000: i think you just have to figure out if i can do the same thing
 Lachrymosa: Hi
 EzraMagbanua: hi guys
 william54321: hi
 william54321: how to do the first puzzle AI
 Ainizoda: i'm a cofee machine
 MSmits: cofveve
 Ainizoda:&#160;?
 MSmits: covfefe, sry
 Ainizoda: Guys, tell me which lang are good? [js, python, c++]
 MSmits: that minus js&#160;:)
 MadKnight: and plus c#
 Lachrymosa: whatever language gets the job done really
 Stormalix: UM
 Stormalix: IM SORRY WHAT
 Stormalix: JS IS GOOD
 Ainizoda: who can tell me most popular  JavaScript framework&#160;?
 MSmits: jquery?
 Ainizoda: no
 MSmits: react?
 Ainizoda: jq is a lib
 MSmits: o
 Ainizoda: yeah its react
 MSmits: i dislike react, not sure why
 EzraMagbanua: SAME
 EzraMagbanua: REACT IS SHIT
 monstaber: slows down the frontend like hell
 Ainizoda: tell me your favourite framework for frontend
 WOLFRAHH: hey Ainizoda can u stop Nonsense questions
 Ainizoda: ITS OK
 WOLFRAHH: you are spaming the chat
 Ainizoda: it's not a spam - just question
 WOLFRAHH: hey MadKnight can u tell me about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think i have some ideas
 MSmits: maybe Automaton2000 has to tell you about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you can say that you are right
 WOLFRAHH: i can't understand Automaton2000 MSmits
 Automaton2000: i remember why i never got to the top
 MSmits: use google translate
 WOLFRAHH: ohh noo i can understand the sentence tell by Automaton2000 but it sentence are different
 Automaton2000: unless you find a new job
 WOLFRAHH: u can see MSmits
 MSmits: I don't understand either of you :P
 WOLFRAHH: :cold_sweat:
 EzraMagbanua: hey WOLFRAHH can u stop Nonsense chat
 EzraMagbanua: you are spamming chat
 EzraMagbanua: see how mean you are
 WOLFRAHH: what i am not spamming chat EzraMagbanua
 WOLFRAHH: i want to know about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: my goal is to make a nn for csb
 Lachrymosa: typical chatbot, spouts pre-programmed nonsense when it's name is mentioned.
 WOLFRAHH: i agree with Lachrymosa
 Ainizoda: â˜º
 monstaber: &lt;(")
 MSmits: not preprogrammed
 MSmits: it's based on what others said
 MSmits: afaik
 Lachrymosa: I thought it just meme'd based on popular phrases but that those were thrown in manually, idk really
 WOLFRAHH: ohh
 WOLFRAHH: MSmits
 MSmits: it's just not a very good chatbot, but it does gather information from here somehow
 MSmits: its brother AutomatonNN had to be adjusted because it kept bothering eulerscheZah l
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see how many times it was a bit confusing
 MSmits: my point exactly
 MSmits: i tried to not ping euler
 MSmits: it does this because euler always gets asked questions
 MSmits: so it thinks thats normal and it starts to ask euler questions as well
 MSmits: definitely not preprogrammed&#160;:)
 MSmits: but they tried to deprogram it and failed
 MSmits: apparently
 MSmits: the euler-urge is too strong
 MSmits: one time it just started insulting euler as well
 MSmits: calling him a noob
 Lachrymosa: Thats actually fantastic lol, reminds me of Daisy chatbot from the 2000s
 MSmits: it was pretty funny for a while, maybe not so much for euler&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: Well yea, especially with how active he is on here
 MSmits: yea
 Lachrymosa: but I just love little quirks like these
 MSmits: I think one of them, maybe both, is coded using markov chains
 MSmits: someone wrote a playground abou tit
 Lachrymosa: dunno what those are tbh
 MSmits: tech.io
 MSmits: it's basically just about guessing the next state based on the previous state.
 MSmits: otherwise google it, it's not very advanced stuff, but pretty well known
 derjack: good morning
 MSmits: hi there pony
 MSmits: I've been reading about MLP
 MSmits: ... and resnets and stuff
 derjack: there is no way out
 MSmits: seems so&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am guessing you are referring to both my little pony and multi layer perceptron?
 derjack: eeyup
 MSmits: thought so :P
 Lachrymosa: So the unfortunate thing about my coding experience is I have figured this stuff out as far as I have with no formal education.  I have missed out on all the lovely math and structured lessons that a class might have had.  So looking at this Markov Chain stuff its a little much for 2:30 at night lol
 derjack: but i know by heart only good old multilater perceptron. i havent done convnet or resnet myself yet
 MSmits: Lachrymosa it's probably just the notation thats giving you problems, the ideas are easy. If you want, you can do the CS 50 introduction to AI at harvard university. It's free. One of the subjects is markov chains
 MSmits: they have nice exercises as well
 MSmits: you learn some AI basics
 Bembo150: how can i run all testcases and show an output for each one??
 Lachrymosa: oh wow, yea I definitely want more of that
 derjack: math is heavy but most stuff is easy once you code it
 MSmits: from what I gather derjack you did some basic NN stuff and when you  mastered that, you just started messing with bots right? 
 Lachrymosa: Once upon a time I knew basic calculus but that was 10+ years ago
 Lachrymosa: I'm doin alright to muddle through trig nowadays
 derjack: MSmits yes. messing with training 'pipeline'
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: might be worth trying some more advanced stuff and then move back to applying it
 MSmits: you might get better bots 
 MSmits: even though you're doing fine
 MSmits: I am totally fascinated with muzero. But it seems hard to use in CG. More efficient to just do azero
 Lachrymosa: My bots are heuristics only, no future evaluation :V
 MSmits: heuristics work well in some multis
 MSmits: not the simple boardgames though
 MSmits: well you still use heuristics, but as part of pruning or evaluation
 Lachrymosa: Yea, I think I did implement a frame for min/max, but where I fail is figuring out how to evaluate a board state to feed into the MM
 MSmits: Lachrymosa doing a search based bot is really easy as long as you start with a very simple game and search
 MSmits: how do you mean you fail?
 derjack: MM?
 MSmits: minimax i guess
 Lachrymosa: I have difficulty conceptualizing a board state into a number
 Lachrymosa: yea
 MSmits: Lachrymosa that has nothing to do with the actual seach
 MSmits: you would have the same problem just using heuristics
 MSmits: because with heuristics you're also evaluating
 MSmits: basically evaluation is like this:
 dbdr: Lachrymosa: start with a simple evaluation, like the current score only
 MSmits: make a list of things that are good about a state
 dbdr: then you can add other aspects
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: give each a parameter
 derjack: something simple, like in chess you would only count material: sum of my pieces - sum of opponent pieces.
 Lachrymosa: so lets take breakthrough for example, cause thats one that I have "working". Score could be having more pieces, or having a piece closer to the end?
 MSmits: breakthrough is really really hard to eval imho
 MSmits: not a good place to start 
 Lachrymosa: deceptively hard then
 MSmits: yeah
 Lachrymosa: Vindinium?
 derjack: good place to start :f
 MSmits: i dont know abotu vindi
 MSmits: oware is doable
 MSmits: i had no problems with onitama
 Lachrymosa: I just capture as many mines as I can until i'm half health, heal, and keep going
 derjack: for breakthrough you can do material and/or piece-square tables
 MSmits: derjack sure, i did that, but did not get into top 10
 MSmits: and i usually do
 MSmits: oware has a website where you can steal an eval
 derjack: for a beginner i think top 10 isn't the goal yet
 Lachrymosa: Honestly if I make something that just works I'm happy lol
 MSmits: sure, that's true
 derjack: having trouble with eval? use vanilla mcts :v
 MSmits: i am just extrapolating, if i have problems finding a good eval, a beginner might also
 Lachrymosa: vanilla mcts?
 MSmits: mcts is a bit harder to code than minimax
 MSmits: the first time that is
 derjack: monte carlo tree search
 RedPony_ed7e: is there a java solution to this problem
 derjack: 'vanilla' refers to the basic version
 MSmits: no bells and whistles
 Lachrymosa: ah ok, I've read the basic premise of these things, but again implementation is hard for me to conceptualize into code
 MSmits: yeah, but minimax should be no problem and works in many games
 MSmits: it's a very small function
 MSmits: mcts has many parts
 MSmits: and works in fewer games
 derjack: for minimax you can omit eval and just do if win -&gt; inf, if lose -&gt; -inf
 MSmits: to start with yeah, i always do that
 Lachrymosa: Ok, so just setting highest bounds and evaluating a loss or a win
 derjack: it will be dumb but most of the time better than random bots
 derjack: and the rest is 0.
 MSmits: then you can easily improve it by counting material later
 Lachrymosa: then I can add more evaluations as a gradient later?
 MSmits: i wouldnt call it a gradient, its just a sum usually
 MSmits: a * materialcount + b* something else + c * yetanotherthing
 MSmits: always make it symmetric between you and opponent, or at least that would make sense
 Lachrymosa: and those could be number of pieces i have + number of pieces closer than 3 moves to end + etc.
 MSmits: so for you the material is positive, for opponent negative
 Lachrymosa: yea, zero sum game right?
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: btw if you make regular minimax work, try to convert to negamax, it's quite easy to do and a much more compact/prettier version
 Lachrymosa: so if I eval'd loss or win it would really only not be random if a win or a loss condition presented itself  right?
 MSmits: and add ab-pruning. Wikipedia has good pseudo code for negamax ab
 MSmits: Lachrymosa right
 MSmits: but it may present itself 5 turns before the end
 MSmits: because you do iterative deepening
 Lachrymosa: ohhh thats right
 MSmits: first 1 depth search, then 2 depth etc
 Lachrymosa: so I wouldn't even start down the "wrong" path if I could help it
 MSmits: right
 Lachrymosa: In my new job they're offering me actual coding classes, so hopefully with some formal education and junk I can nail some of this down better.  Without the structured guidance I get too ahead of myself and lose sight of the easy steps for fear of the whole staircase
 MSmits: btw, i dont usually use minimax, i have more succes with mcts variants. But  tric trac kar liso and others all have great succes with minimax variants. It's a fine algo
 MSmits: I did not have a formal CS education either, but math-wise i was ok because I did have one for physics
 Lachrymosa: I even got that book The Algorithm Design Manual, which was neat up until it started using linear algebra terms and notation and then I was lost cause I don't know that stuff yet :V
 MSmits: yeah that's a hard one to learn from books
 MSmits: unless you're ridiculously talented
 Verified__: I got to number 1 in the racing game!
 Lachrymosa: Noice :D
 MSmits: in which league?
 Verified__: wood lol
 MSmits: well grats, thats how it works
 Lachrymosa: kek
 MSmits: get nr 1 and move on&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: oh wow, I haven't checked on my racer in ages
 MSmits: gotta go do some shopping, hf&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: pce, thanks for the tips
 MSmits: np

 Godofdeath1: what
 Puru299792458: in child's play 
 Puru299792458: do we have to right the logic to detect loop 
 Puru299792458: or do we have reduce the number of turns 
 Puru299792458: so that computation is fast.
 derjack: preferably find shortest path
 Puru299792458: nope  that's not the ques

 tutubalin: question about NS script.how can modify it to login via GitHub?
 jacek: you cant
 jacek: you can reset password though and login via password
 tutubalin: ok, thanks
 Tiouz: I had the same question&#160;! I started NS today&#160;!
 Tiouz: thanks
 jacek: why interest in NS so suddenly
 Tiouz: I don't know, it is not related to tutubalin interest
 AntiSquid: now everyone wants to get level 999 jacek lol
 Tiouz: but, how can you reset password&#160;? I&#160;tried but it tells me wrong password (and I&#160;know my passwd)
 Tiouz: I&#160;sign up via google
 Tiouz: and yeah that 999 is beautiful
 AntiSquid: prepare to spend the next few months of your life on it
 Tiouz: Well, I have so many optimisation problems to improve, one more will not change anything
 AntiSquid: if you can do it faster than Marchet then congratz
 Tiouz: I have to re-implement the 2048 in C because python is limitating me I feel
 Tiouz: I&#160;didn't even understood the approach he did.
 Tiouz: I&#160;heard LAHC, but I&#160;don't see how it applies
 Marchete: faster?
 Marchete: level 1000 takes around 10-30 minutes on a corei7
 Marchete: depending on the luck
 AntiSquid: you said the mid levels were a pain
 Marchete: without my latest changes
 Marchete: can't say now
 Marchete: i.e. I retested my old LAHC limit
 Tiouz: You should run everything from start to see
 Marchete: level 335 and 336
 Marchete: 15 seconds and 120 seconds
 Marchete: yeaj
 Marchete: yeah, I thought about letting it like 4 hours
 Marchete: to see how far it goes
 Marchete: but I need some tweaks
 Marchete: current code doesn't expect that much approximations
 AntiSquid: i thought you'd jump on the next thing now
 Marchete: yeah PostMortem
 Marchete: then another thing
 Marchete: but I'd like to analyze better why in that specific game my changes worked so well
 Tiouz: Just to be clear, LAHC is a kind of LNS/SA&#160;?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: it's just a simplified SA
 Marchete: it just "works"
 Marchete: in my case it missed a lot of near solutions
 Marchete: so I need to add tweaks and more tweaks
 Tiouz: and you just apply it on the sequence of movements&#160;?
 Marchete: needed
 Tiouz: I&#160;don't see how you can change a current solution to improve it... But I&#160;need to think more deeply into it
 Marchete: mutation
 Marchete: divide your moves on independent lists of moves
 Marchete: then simply remove a random move
 Tiouz: anyway, I can't change my password, and I&#160;can't login using google in the scrpit, so currencly I am blocked with the IDE
 Marchete: remove N moves from the end of the list
 Marchete: of a list*
 Tiouz: Modifying a move should impact all the subsequent moves...
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: except*
 Marchete: with Merges
 Marchete: srcVal = 2*destVal
 Marchete: abs( destVal - srcVal) = abs(destVal - 2*destVal) = abs(-destVal) = destVal
 Marchete: free move joinings
 Marchete: you can always subtract a 8 to a 4
 Marchete: destination doesn't change, you don't break anything on your state
 Tiouz: Except if you needed the 8 for something else
 MadKnight: oh hey Marchete
 Marchete: hey Maddy
 MadKnight: are u making a PM soon&#160;?
 Marchete: yeah
 MadKnight: oh nice
 MadKnight: #ru chat is waiting for it
 Marchete: if you needed the 8 for something else you'll mutate that point eventually
 Marchete: but with merges you have removed 1 number "for free"
 Marchete: that and move ordering (permutation) are key features in my code
 Tiouz: Ok, I will try
 Marchete: sometimes you can "solve" a number by just reordering the moves applied to it
 Marchete: others is a bit complex
 Marchete: you need to permute the incomplete number + some other number to merge or cancel both
 Tiouz: Is there a way to at least get the board to work offline&#160;?
 Marchete: what level?
 AntiSquid: seriously write a paper, so you have your own variant on it, there seem be 100+ papers on any given subject anyway
 Marchete: from those 98 papers are toilet ones
 Marchete: just to fill some quota
 AntiSquid: you can #99
 Tiouz: any level. I just can't use the script because I am connecting with google
 Marchete: you can export levels with
 Marchete: echo "level_password";cat &gt;&amp;2
 Marchete: on Bash
 Marchete: on stderr it appears
 Tiouz: Ok
 AntiSquid: doesn't euler's web tool allow you to load specific level&#160;?
 Marchete: yes, but it's not direct
 Tiouz: I get an error with euler's tool because it asks me to connect with google
 Marchete: it's a bit hidden
 Marchete: you maybe can override that
 AntiSquid: i mean the browser game version
 Marchete: by giving some cookie or smth
 AntiSquid: you need to sort out the request bit
 Tiouz: what&#160;?
 AntiSquid: in the python script, what else you using @_@
 jacek: ruby script?
 AntiSquid: because you can golf it better&#160;?
 Tiouz: that python scrpit is my problem, because it won't connect, and I&#160;just tried to skip the connection part, but it fails afterwards
 Marchete: you need credentials
 Marchete: if you can't get user/pass, then try to use dev Chrome to see what is sending in the request
 Marchete: maybe you can get a cookie/handle from there, and use it in your python script instead of user/pass
 Tiouz: Feels like a lot of work for a problem that I&#160;don't even know I&#160;will want to grind
 Tiouz: And definitely not in my skillset
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: ok
 Tiouz: Maybe in one week you will see me again asking for help
 Tiouz: but for now, I will start by the easy boards
 Marchete: then make a bogus account with user/pass
 Marchete: simpler
 Tiouz: Yes, that would work
 Tiouz: How many moves have the last solutions&#160;?
 Marchete: which solution?&#160;:)
 Marchete: as the server broke I keep sending solutions because it won't give a next level
 Marchete: one of them, 1008 moves
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1cb6b60c-d85d-424f-8fb1-7c6ba085a4ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1cb6b60c-d85d-424f-8fb1-7c6ba085a4ae</a>
 Marchete: one huge movelist
 Marchete: 926 moves all merged in a single list
 AntiSquid: maybe now it's faster to bruteforce password and level number :thinking:
 Marchete: I doubt it
 Marchete: SecureRandom is not easy to crack
 Marchete: My NS Solver is a solver based on game specific properties
 Marchete: for good or bad
 Marchete: good thing: I can marge lists easily
 Marchete: bad thing: that makes huge lists
 Marchete: harder to mutate because any change affects
 Marchete: well, pretty much 95% of the numbers
 AntiSquid: so how many threads did you use in the end if you used them
 Marchete: I have a Corei7 8700K
 Marchete: 5 cores, 10 threads
 Marchete: with that I can solve it in affordable time
 Marchete: mid level without all improvements was hell
 Marchete: like having 70 cores for days?
 Marchete: without getting anything
 Minato_N: hi
 Minato_N: wassup people
 AntiSquid: read chat and find out
 Tiouz: Just me complaining about google authentication
 Tiouz: And praising lord Marchete for 999 in NS
 Minato_N: @AntiSquid lol
 AntiSquid: what?
 Minato_N: the response, "read chat and find out"
 Marchete: I think it's not about being good, but being constant
 AntiSquid: want a quote from the movie idiocracy about reading?
 Marchete: I suck against most coders
 Marchete: but with enough time I can achieve something
 Marchete: I started NS last year, got mad and left it until this year
 Tiouz: Well, I started CodinGame few weeks ago
 Marchete: good luck, it's a nice platform
 Marchete: and you can learn a lot from these GM coders
 Marchete: that you'll see on chat
 Tiouz: GM = grandmaster&#160;?
 Marchete: yeah
 Tiouz: I know that techniques like the ones on optimisation problems will be useful for me
 Marchete: I've learned a lot from them
 Minato_N: programming is amazzzzzzzing
 Rival819: Stuck is my middle name :D
 Tiouz: could be worse, could be better
 Rival819: Im stuck at the Boss 2 of AI...for some reason I dont understand how to do the else statement so that it works.
 Rival819: I do:
 Rival819: else thrust = 100
 Rival819: end if
 Rival819: but im stuck at the else not working in any way I put it xD
 Marchete: thrust =0;
 Marchete: else thrust = 100;
 Rival819: did those also
 Marchete: what lang?
 Rival819: C#
 Tiouz: haha giving solution before knowing lang^^
 Marchete: C# hasn't end if
 Rival819: aaahh I see so the pseudo code they give me might be python then
 AntiSquid: did you check X Y&#160;? @_@
 Marchete: not python
 Rival819: convenient -.-
 Marchete: python has&#160;: on if
 Rival819: oh
 Marchete: so&#160;; is the most probable thing
 jacek: so you copy pasted the pseudo code and it doesnt work? *gasp*
 Rival819: no I tried writing it in different ways I could think of
 Rival819: I know how to change thrust I understand the X and Y and also I made them checkpointangle a variable of only Y or X in caps
 Rival819: I understand what the angle and the distance his used for
 Rival819: just dunno where to use it :D 
 Rival819: :Scratching head: :P
 Rival819: basically max thrust his 100 cannot go higher anyway pod would fly off the screen too far at higher speed
 Rival819: I figured
 Marchete: -3*vel
 AntiSquid: you'll get a bruise if you scratch it too long&#160;:/
 Rival819: hahaha :P
 AntiSquid: and possible bold patch from the trauma
 Rival819: xD

 Marchete: search on cg.spdns.eu about the golden formula in CSB
 Marchete: -3*vel
 Marchete: right to Gold
 Rival819: -3 time velocity&#160;?
 Rival819: :D hahaha
 Minato_N: yo
 Unicorn123321: hm....
 AntiSquid: well 3 people said it
 AntiSquid: so it must be true
 AntiSquid: in that chat history
 GilbertGaming27: Gilbert
 Tiouz: I think I&#160;discovered that formula on my own. It is just because you need to correct the fact that your pod can circle over CPs indefinitely
 iwantcakenow21: Gilbert
 iwantcakenow21: Moment
 GilbertGaming27: When the the
 GilbertGaming27: The Whe
 Rival819: no my pod follows it just too slow because it makes too many wide turns so I think I have to correct it so it gets more precise using nexCheckpointAngle and nextCheckpointDist
 Rival819: aaannnnnnddddd I just answered myself
 Rival819: im not using nextCheckpointDist at all xD
 jlb1108: what datatype can you append in C#? List, Array, Collections?
 Rival819: all of them I think, not sure if I am right
 Rival819: Class, Array, List
 jlb1108: working on ASCII ART and want to incrementally add the result of a split
 Rival819: oh, im not advanced enough sry for my unknowledgable answer :P
 creeperZnation4: jib1108, I don't know c# that well, but in Java, you can append using a list, so if they're anything alike then maybe a List will work
 creeperZnation4: And I mean the collection, not the Array (cause I think arrays are called lists in python or something)
 creeperZnation4: or the Object class I mean
 jlb1108: whats the operation for appending a  list item in java?
 creeperZnation4: list.add(Object o)
 jlb1108: That operation doesn't remove the existing value?
 creeperZnation4: yeah, it doesn't change anything in the list
 jlb1108: hmm, ill see how that works out in C#
 jlb1108: thanks
 creeperZnation4: k np
 creeperZnation4: gl th9o
 creeperZnation4: tho*
 ElJafar: which one is the most ideal language for the shortest code?
 ElJafar: ruby?
 creeperZnation4: probablu
 creeperZnation4: it's the shortest syntax wise
 creeperZnation4: I've never used it tho, so idk if it can be limiting in any way
 creeperZnation4: Python is the most popular from what I've seen tho
 ElJafar: hmm ty
 creeperZnation4: np... you planning on trying python or ruby?
 creeperZnation4: Or were u just curious or something
 Nuggs: gilbert coding
 GilbertGaming27: HOW
 iwantcakenow21: coding
 creeperZnation4: Gilbert guess you've got eyes on you XD
 ElJafar: nah I saw a lot of ppl using ruby and python for shortest code. But I wonder if any language exist for only this purpose
 creeperZnation4: Ah ok
 ElJafar: Ruby coders are amazing tho XD
 ElJafar: 1 line of code 25 function :D
 creeperZnation4: IKR XD
 Tiouz: I have a super weird bug, in python in NS, but it is on reading the input. I have the usual for loop, but the last input do not seem to come (timeout on input()), but when I increase the range of the for, I&#160;get the last line...
 Tiouz: Like when I say&#160;:&#160;read 5 inputs, it doesn't find the 5th, but if I say find 6 inputs, then it finds the 5th, and fails at 6th (because there should not be any 6th)
 Pegondo99: Hi guys! Does anyone know where I can find the puzzles I have already completed? Im nooby
 Pegondo99:&#160;:)
 Tiouz: Ok, it was just a problem of flushing
 brenann2012: hi I do not know how to code can somebody help me&#160;?
 Tiouz: brenann2012, maybe find a tutorial online, for example on OpenClassroom
 Husoski: @pegondo99 They're moved to the end of the list in each difficulty level, with a check mark.  
 Rival819: anyone knows what wrong with this code&#160;?

 Rival819: it is as if I cannot use else&#160;? I am using C#
 ElJafar: else {Y = 100;
 Rival819: omg missing a damn bracket
 Rival819: visual mistake.....im a noob
 Rival819: haha thx
 Rival819: :D
 Rival819: working now missing the distance check :D
 Rival819: I fell asleep on this one earlier haha
 ElJafar: haha yw
 NTPace: hello every body
 Rival819: hi
 Rival819: hi

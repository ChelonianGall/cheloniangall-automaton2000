 WINWINWIN: I am trying to pass an argument in python, dont know why but its type is changing as I pass the argument
 WINWINWIN: any reason?
 tomatoes: python is strongly typed :thinking:
 tomatoes: types cant change
 Alshock: I think you're not passing the argument that you think you're passing
 WINWINWIN: Let me check on that
 MSmits: hmm did not know python is strongly typed
 MSmits: I guess it's just that you don't know what the type is when you're writing the code
 MSmits: or at least... it's hard to tell
 karliso: I remember this was discussed and you were surprised also before.
 MSmits: lol karliso, maybe I should visit a doctor. Thanks for being my memory :P
 karliso: I even copied from wiki what is stongly typed and why python is so called duck typed.
 MSmits: hmm vaguely remember now
 karliso: Was more than half a year ago though.
 MSmits: I see

 IcedBlackSapphire: probably by touch typing
 IcedBlackSapphire: what wpm are we talking about
 AbdelkrimBournane: yes, I type without looking to my keyboard 
 IcedBlackSapphire: i think &gt; 100 wpm is crazy
 AbdelkrimBournane: I'm programmer for 3 years now

 uvBoss: hello
 uvBoss: can anyone explain linear conflict heuristic in 8 puzzle??????????????????
 uvBoss: im doin just manhatan distance and it takes almost 15 secs for the output of 25 moves
 Uljahn: if you think the puzzle is too hard for you just skip it
 IcedBlackSapphire: I've been trying chess.com, codingame and typeracer as activities to replace smoking. Any more ideas?
 pde-bakk: crystal meth
 Astrobytes: Vape. Worked for me.
 Astrobytes: (not vaping meth ofc)
 IcedBlackSapphire: is there any moderation in this chat?
 IcedBlackSapphire: i know it's probably meant as a joke, but that stuff is not funny 
 Astrobytes: Yep. AntiSquid is a moderator
 IcedBlackSapphire: ok, don't want to make recommendations on what to mod, just thanks for the information that there is indeed moderation
 Astrobytes: Vaping though. Worked for me. Stopped smoking like... jsut over 2 years ago now?
 IcedBlackSapphire: did you stop vaping as well?
 AntiSquid: what isn't funny&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I did. But recently started vaping 0% nic for my anxiety
 IcedBlackSapphire: @antisquid, message by pde-bakk 
 IcedBlackSapphire: ok, maybe i should reconsider vaping then. gave it a try in 2016
 AntiSquid: i guess it more of a personal perspective, no idea what you went through in your life IcedBlackSapphire
 Astrobytes: Look into building your own coils etc. It's cheaper, better, and all you need is Ohm's law, some battery info and some wire&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: he wasn't seriously suggesting you do drugs though
 IcedBlackSapphire: i know, i also make these jokes sometimes
 Astrobytes: Guy called Mooch on youtube will tell you *all* you need to know about batteries/battery safety, and more
 DavidTheNewKid: If he was seriously suggesting drugs, he might be seriously on drugs&#160;:)
 IcedBlackSapphire: i don't know, probably spend too much time on reddit, normally i'd just laugh
 Astrobytes: reddit is bad for the mind :P

 IcedBlackSapphire: what is it with red colored chat?
 AntiSquid: probably someone hacked you
 Astrobytes: If your username is mentioned it will turn the message red IcedBlackSapphire

 AntiSquid: off by default now? damn&#160;:(
 IcedBlackSapphire: yeah, thank god lol
 IcedBlackSapphire: was it changed recently?
 AntiSquid: welcome to CG btw, enjoy your stay and get an avatar
 JBM: so overrated
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: ah my worst enemy is in chat
 IcedBlackSapphire: chat is always a tricky topic, so easy to get toxic
 WINWINWIN: avatars are mandatory
 AntiSquid: anime avatars even unlock hidden premium features, such +5% win rate chance on bot submits
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: CG chat is usually just fine IcedBlackSapphire. We troll each other a fair bit but it's well moderated and we don't tolerate bad behaviour

 DavidTheNewKid: If I code up vote that statement I would.

 MSmits: that sounds like something a priest would say
 AntiSquid: ofc, it's java
 IAmNoob: lol
 struct: I need to use jvm language for sdk
 struct: otherwise i wouldnt touch java
 AntiSquid: use kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: and i thought priests like to touch everything?
 MSmits: do as I say, not as I do
 AntiSquid: struct is a priest in real life?
 eulerscheZahl: no, a barkeeper
 struct: Im not gonna learn kotlin just for sdk
 AntiSquid: but it's basically like java

 AntiSquid: D can do that too
 IAmNoob: i am at coders strike back in gold the 359th any sugestions?]

 eulerscheZahl: but the codingame SDK doesn't support D
 IAmNoob: and in code of kutulu too in gold
 eulerscheZahl: except maybe if you build a Rube Goldberg machine around it
 AntiSquid: do you have a blocker for CSB&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i have an ad blocker
 Astrobytes: Rube Goldberg D wrapper for the CG SDK... I can't even begin to imagine
 Astrobytes: Maybe that should be some kind of long running reverse-optim contest

 IAmNoob: Is it a problem if someone knows my IP?
 struct: Depends on this "someone"
 IAmNoob: a person who i dont know
 struct: Why does he have your IP?
 IAmNoob: can he make jail if he shares it?
 IAmNoob: struct i dont know
 struct: make jaiL?
 HereticalCocktail_1485: try to get a new ip address
 IAmNoob: i was trading something and he got many of my personal dates
 IAmNoob: How?
 AntiSquid: D crowd disappeared as soon as the language was added
 AntiSquid: kinda lame
 struct: I dont know if reseting router is enough, depends on ISP
 eulerscheZahl: at least they stopped spamming the forum
 eulerscheZahl: "Oh, we will have the D. A lot of puns and jokes incoming on the world chat."Magus was so right
 AntiSquid: i can reset router for mine to change IP
 struct: If it doesnt change call your ISP
 IAmNoob: what can he make withg my ip
 Magus: :D
 struct: Yeah, it should work, but with some ISP it wont change
 IcedBlackSapphire: also i wouldn't know what they could do with y our ip
 Astrobytes: I think they'd already started incoming already at that point :D
 HereticalCocktail_1485: if your ISP has good router settings he shouldnt be able to do anything
 IcedBlackSapphire: like, unless they know the type of router hardware you're using + 0days of that hardware/software of the router
 IAmNoob: he knows where i live
 HereticalCocktail_1485: but if he finds a weakness in an open port he could be able to get your personal dat
 AntiSquid: lol
 HereticalCocktail_1485: a
 IAmNoob: thats all
 AntiSquid: talk to your ISP 
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: i'll try
 struct: Try reseting router first
 IAmNoob: holly
 IcedBlackSapphire: you probably have a dynamic ip, it will change every few hours or days anyway
 IAmNoob: huh
 IAmNoob: thanks god
 AntiSquid: you got spyware on your pc or what
 IAmNoob: i am lucky
 IAmNoob: no
 IcedBlackSapphire: i don't it's weird they got your ip in the first place
 AntiSquid: i need to reset my router to change it IcedBlackSapphire
 IcedBlackSapphire: and why do you know that they know your ip
 IcedBlackSapphire: yeah, is the same for me @antisquid
 IAmNoob: someone just sent me a message that he knoes my ip
 IAmNoob: and sent it to me
 IAmNoob: and it was right
 struct: Where?
 IAmNoob: so:((
 IAmNoob: on discord
 AntiSquid: well someone sent me a message that they know my underwear color
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 HereticalCocktail_1485: did it start with 192.168?
 IAmNoob: the ip was corect
 IAmNoob: wait
 IcedBlackSapphire: lol did it start with 192 :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah reset your router, chances are their DHCP will dynamically allocate you an IP when you reset.
 HereticalCocktail_1485: looolll
 HereticalCocktail_1485: no dont worry
 HereticalCocktail_1485: thats a private address 
 IAmNoob: no
 HereticalCocktail_1485: he cant access your pc without being in the same network 
 IAmNoob: the Ip dont started with 192
 IcedBlackSapphire: ok, so they know your public ip address it seems
 HereticalCocktail_1485: ah ok then 
 IAmNoob: is this a problem
 IcedBlackSapphire: did you click any links in the discord?
 IAmNoob: yes
 IcedBlackSapphire: ahh
 IAmNoob: a photo
 IAmNoob: link
 IAmNoob: something bad?
 IcedBlackSapphire: ok, i don't know how exactly it works in discord
 Astrobytes: RESET YOUR ROUTER
 IcedBlackSapphire: but when you visit a website, the website owner will get your ip
 IAmNoob: i'll make a dumb thing
 AntiSquid: was the link something like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.whatsmyip.org/">https://www.whatsmyip.org/</a>&#160;?
 IAmNoob: no
 eulerscheZahl: myip.isfaster to type
 IcedBlackSapphire: @AntiSquid, no he cliked on a photo in discord and i was presuming the other guy is hosting that pic and baiting ppl
 Astrobytes: Wasn't 127.0.0.1 was it? :P
 struct: Download image metadata, and reverse expose him
 eulerscheZahl: how do you know my IP Astrobytes? that's scary
 Astrobytes: :D
 IAmNoob: yes sure
 AntiSquid: best thing to do is panic
 IcedBlackSapphire: and run outside and scream so neighbours hear you
 IAmNoob: no non on
 Astrobytes: And chuck your PC out the window
 AntiSquid: format hard drive, delete everything even your girlfriend
 Astrobytes: Then burn your router.
 IcedBlackSapphire: and call police
 IAmNoob: i dont have
 Astrobytes: Then take off, nuke the site from orbit.
 Astrobytes: The only way to be sure.
 IcedBlackSapphire: what was that reddit meme again for guys after break up
 IcedBlackSapphire: 1 lift weights
 IcedBlackSapphire: 2 delete facebook

 HereticalCocktail_1485: man he just knows ur ip dont worry lmao
 HereticalCocktail_1485: just get a new one
 IAmNoob: ok ok ok ok
 IAmNoob: he know where i leave
 HereticalCocktail_1485: u can do it&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: thx bro
 HereticalCocktail_1485: ur address or city?
 IAmNoob: city
 Astrobytes: Dude. Like I said. Reset the router. Your ISP's DHCP server will most likely allocate you a different one when it receives the request from your router.
 struct: its normal IAmNoob
 IAmNoob: huh 
 struct: stop being scared and reset router
 IAmNoob: i woried
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: i will be gone 10 min
 IAmNoob: bye
 HereticalCocktail_1485: good luck
 IcedBlackSapphire: dude stop being worried, they public ip probably routes to your ISP
 Clagus: Astrobytes not necesarily.. I get the same ip every time and I didn't buy static IP option
 thepianist59: just a little details which is not indicated the the challenge of the week (rock paper  scissors lizard spock) that I discovered. When there is a tie, the challenge tells us to let win the one with the less victories. But there is no indication if there is also a tie in the number of victories. In that case, it's the player with the lowest id who wins
 AntiSquid: IAmNoob get McAfee antivirus, here's how to install: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg</a>
 IcedBlackSapphire: it's not possible for any hacker even mr.robot if he existed in rl to do anything malicous using your ip
 Astrobytes: Ofc Clagus, most ISPs do give you a dynamic one tho'
 struct: If i want static IP I must pay 20€ month
 struct: damn
 AntiSquid: what crap ending that show had IcedBlackSapphire
 AntiSquid: i mean it was bad for most part, but damn ...
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have my own IPv4 anymore
 Astrobytes: Didn't bother watching that
 Marchete: I'd say that's NSFW
 eulerscheZahl: which is annoying for gaming
 IcedBlackSapphire: @AntiSquid if you mean everything except season 1 with ending i agree
 Astrobytes: Currently rewatching Breaking Bad
 tomatoes: thepianist59 isnt it about lowest player id?
 HereticalCocktail_1485: What is not safe for work?
 HereticalCocktail_1485: i am at work right now
 IcedBlackSapphire: shouldn't isps close all non-secure ports for routing from public-ip to router anyway?
 AntiSquid: well even in season 1 they had the gay part just to say they are tolerant basically IcedBlackSapphire
 AntiSquid: some ISPs are there just to make money, so no
 IcedBlackSapphire: gay part? don't even remember
 AntiSquid: tyrel or whatever
 IcedBlackSapphire: i would except that the actual ip of my router is actually not accessible to outside
 IcedBlackSapphire: so the public ip is a the ip of some virtualization on the isp hardware
 IcedBlackSapphire: which then routes everything through a firewall to my router ip
 IcedBlackSapphire: expect
 IcedBlackSapphire: not except
 IcedBlackSapphire: tyrel sounds like a cliche black person's name
 IcedBlackSapphire: they didn't catch two birds with one stone didn't they?
 AntiSquid: except he was the blondie guy
 IcedBlackSapphire: ah ok
 IcedBlackSapphire: so they hacked us lol
 IcedBlackSapphire: maybe there is some money in certifying isps for security
 AntiSquid: The Boys is best TV show i know of
 IcedBlackSapphire: ugh i can't watch superhero type
 thepianist59: @tomatoes, yes, it's the id
 Astrobytes: Totally fed up with the whole superhero thing also
 IcedBlackSapphire: silicon valley was a show i enjoyed
 Astrobytes: Though I still watch the first 3 X-Men movies from time to time
 IcedBlackSapphire: mike judge generally makes great stuff
 IcedBlackSapphire: jesus christ how can ya'll watch this superhero stuff
 Astrobytes: Office Space wasn't all that
 IcedBlackSapphire: office space was crazily good
 Astrobytes: But Idiocracy was the nuts
 Astrobytes: I felt Office Space had potential, and I enjoyed parts, but it didn't live up to my expectations
 IcedBlackSapphire: i prefer office space, but idiocracy is also a gem
 IcedBlackSapphire: how were the expectations for office space build up?
 AntiSquid: IcedBlackSapphire well i hate marvel movies / don't really enjoy super hero movies, but The Boys is different
 AntiSquid: just watch first episode maybe
 IcedBlackSapphire: is it satire? @AntiSquid
 IcedBlackSapphire: i could imagine watching a show where they parody super hero stuff
 AntiSquid: i would say it's more realistic
 Astrobytes: I, er, still watch Beavis and Butt-Head Do America sometimes
 AntiSquid: what people would be like if they had super powers
 IcedBlackSapphire: more realistic also sounds interesting

 Astrobytes: Joker was good.
 IcedBlackSapphire: "No more criminal activity in gotham, Batman is bored all day"
 AntiSquid: mediocre imo 
 IcedBlackSapphire: watchmen hmmm. the thing is, all hollywood movies except a few gems are the same :D
 IcedBlackSapphire: they all follow a similar script
 AntiSquid: Watchmen is a gem imo
 AntiSquid: it's superhero movie, but not marvel type
 Astrobytes: That's the only way Hollywood makes money, sticking to the formula
 AntiSquid: the watchmen series is garbage though, avoid it
 IcedBlackSapphire: don't you get exhausted by the good guys vs bad guys narrative?
 AntiSquid: IcedBlackSapphire first watch Watchmen / The Boys . then come back 
 IcedBlackSapphire: the secret hollywood formula: make shitty movies and sequels where every script is the same, then trick people with big budget advertising into watching it on popcorn time and lawyer up
 Astrobytes: I recommend an old BBC movie from the early 80s, called Threads. It's about a nuclear attack/war. There is no happy ending, only misery, death and destruction.
 AntiSquid: it's not batman fighting off bat soup enthusiasts
 IcedBlackSapphire: @Astrobytes well now you spoiled it
 IcedBlackSapphire:&#160;:(
 IcedBlackSapphire: :D
 Astrobytes: Nah, that's the whole premise
 Astrobytes: It's the grimmest film in existence. Well, wrt apocalyptic scenarios
 Astrobytes: You should ofc follow that up immediately afterwards with When The Wind Blows
 IcedBlackSapphire: is there a website like codingame just for neural network type of stuff?
 Astrobytes: Kaggle
 IcedBlackSapphire: nah, i mean like clash of code
 IcedBlackSapphire: kaggle is month long competitions
 Astrobytes: You can use NNs on here, but it's a bit fiddly
 Astrobytes: But you couldn't clash using a NN...
 IcedBlackSapphire: oh, like create a contribution for clash of code?
 IcedBlackSapphire: why? because of time to train?
 Astrobytes: Yeah most probably...
 Astrobytes: Better suited for multiplayer bot games
 Astrobytes: Top CSB is NN
 IcedBlackSapphire: csb?
 Astrobytes: Coders Strike Back, the pod-racing one
 IcedBlackSapphire: oh ok, is it using the standard hardware that's accessible to everyone?
 Astrobytes: Quite a few in the top of the CSB league
 IcedBlackSapphire: or is it using mice embryo neurons? Kappa
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: check this article out:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article</a>
 IcedBlackSapphire: i did, but they are not on the leaderboard or am i looking at the wrong leaderboard?

 eulerscheZahl: they changed their names
 IcedBlackSapphire: what is the maximum score obtainable?
 Astrobytes: Anything above reCurs e's mega-score I guess :P
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the other players, there is no real maximum
 eulerscheZahl: larger league =&gt; higher scores
 eulerscheZahl: there's an old leaderboard screenshot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWEen89xgQs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWEen89xgQs</a>
 Astrobytes: I don't remember Dapo being #1 in 2018? Or that's an older screenshot and his upload is 2018?
 eulerscheZahl: pen was first when he uploaded that
 Astrobytes: I remember pen always being #1 until pb 4 and Agad e did that
 Astrobytes: Must've missed it
 eulerscheZahl: Dapo was first for a long time before pen
 Astrobytes: Oh, must be my crappy memory then&#160;:)
 elderlybeginner: anyone knows how to get rid of editor's suggestions and hints?I'm fighting with it for a few days already
 eulerscheZahl: i know. you keep asking this for ways
 eulerscheZahl: days
 Astrobytes: There's only option to toggle "accept suggestion on Enter key" afaik
 elderlybeginner: yep, I'm asking about for a few days, as it's damn annoyingNo, "accept suggestions..." doesn't help. I want to switch it off completly
 JBM: for those who wondered what i was fighting the CG SDK for, yesterday evening: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/84238477bff184d6523d9b7b6a0dd0790496d8">https://www.codingame.com/demo/84238477bff184d6523d9b7b6a0dd0790496d8</a>
 Astrobytes: elderlybeginner, I know that option doesn't help, I was simply pointing out that this is the only autocompletion setting available. Complain to CG.
 Illedan: Dapo was first until they lowered the time limit
 Astrobytes: Aha
 Astrobytes: Nice JBM!
 Illedan: Nice graphics JBM :D
 JBM: yeah i'm quite the talented artist
 eulerscheZahl: "Just read the sample code. You can figure this out."
 Astrobytes: Almost as artistically talented as eulerscheZahl :D
 eulerscheZahl: talking about my initial bender version?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: And the Tower Dereference earliest version
 Astrobytes: That was like a Rembrandt
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: so:when i print a higher number than my opponent, the troll moves towards the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: and the player having the troll at the castle loses
 Illedan: RPS game
 eulerscheZahl: indeed seems too random for me as an official game. but to get started with the SDK: sure
 eulerscheZahl: "can the problem be totally solved?"no. there is no solution
 eulerscheZahl: and there is no spooon
 struct: Fun gamer
 struct: game*
 struct: Wanna see if I can finish Yinsh today
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: i bet against it
 reCurse: Let's spice it up
 reCurse: If you don't finish it today, delete your account
 Illedan: xD
 struct: Okay ill get today a working version, but not final viewer
 eulerscheZahl: if you finish it, Illedan will delete his account. is that enough motivation?
 struct: I want better veiwer
 struct: ok
 struct: deal
 struct: Anyone wanna join?
 struct: I think we can make a big team
 struct: :D
 Illedan: Should I use CSB graphics for SR? :thinking:
 struct: imo no
 ZarthaxX: big delete team
 reCurse: No
 Illedan: Keep like now?
 reCurse: You should just make complex driving physics like drift and stuff
 reCurse: And a race track with mud
 Astrobytes: Use a MM car, with drifting and tyremarks, smoke :P
 eulerscheZahl: SR? Srystal Rush?
 Illedan: search race.
 Illedan: My optim
 eulerscheZahl: the mean max car is great. i have it in 5 colors
 Illedan: Drifting :thinking:
 Illedan: Add handbrake skill too? And oil around the maps?
 reCurse: 2fast2search: Tokyo Drift
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: No oil.
 struct: yes to oil
 struct: rain
 Illedan: Wont :P Will keep it simple
 Astrobytes: Oil not be happy with oil
 reCurse: But it's so boooooring
 Illedan: Because you have a PhD in csb..
 struct: Even some obstacles
 Astrobytes: Like people. Death-First Search Race
 reCurse: Drift-First Search
 struct: Illedan you can have both version
 struct: noob version
 struct: drift version
 Illedan: How is even drift physics :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: no more 2 versions of 1 game please. i considered that nonsense for coders of the realm already
 Astrobytes: Noob: Don't Fucking Search Expert: Drift-First Search
 Astrobytes: That would please some of the people in the PAC PM thread at least
 Illedan: With drift it will fast turn into a RAIC game :D
 reCurse: Do it
 reCurse: Make the referee take 50ms to compute physics
 reCurse: That way no sim is possible
 reCurse: True AI is achieved
 reCurse: etc
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: 100k step movement calculating every little rock and piece of sand
 reCurse: It's not complex enough until you get CG to send you a cease and desist
 struct: also add gearbox please
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: If I add 1000 validators to SR, they might not be happy for spammers :D
 eulerscheZahl: there's a 10MB upload size maximum. i think you have to golf the referee
 Illedan: 165 kb with 150 validators now..
 reCurse: Do you even compress
 reCurse: You just need seed as input
 reCurse: Cmon
 Astrobytes: Also add the slowest procedural smoke generation algo you possibly can
 Illedan: I added exhaust, which is a Fire sprite flipped xD
 Astrobytes: Realtime generation or gtfo
 Illedan: Generate in Java and make huge replays :rocket:
 Astrobytes: CG Perfection.
 reCurse: Juck Fava
 Astrobytes: Actually, if you write the whole thing in Clojure I'll give you €1
 reCurse: Can you invoke nodejs from the SDK? I have funny ideas
 eulerscheZahl: you can run a lot of code from the SDK. julien said you can even add 3D rendering if you want to
 Astrobytes: Jesus christ, can you imagine
 reCurse: No that's very different
 eulerscheZahl: but it's sandboxed. i tried to send requests with user permission but completely failed
 reCurse: PIXI can do 3d, sure
 reCurse: I'm talking about the server side of things
 eulerscheZahl: only coding the referee once and still efficient?
 reCurse: I'd do the whole referee in JS
 reCurse: That way the viewer is almost free
 reCurse: And replays will be the tiniest CG has ever seen
 KittyKora: where do i start
 Astrobytes: At the beginning.
 reCurse: I'd just need to invoke node from the java referee
 KittyKora: where is that
 eulerscheZahl: Amsterdam
 AntiSquid: not in chat KittyKora
 Astrobytes: Onboarding. Easy puzzles.
 KittyKora: then where
 AntiSquid: that's your choice
 KittyKora: could u stop making fun of me
 KittyKora: and stop telling me the obviouse
 reCurse: When you ask tangible questions
 KittyKora: be nice its my 1st time here
 Astrobytes: Nobody is making fun of you. You asked where to start. Easy puzzles is usually the place to start.
 AntiSquid: i don't even know what you want to start
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 be nice to him
 Automaton2000: idk what to do with the info of possible opponent locations
 KittyKora: where do i find easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>

 JBM: there is no legend category
 IAmNoob: it is
 IAmNoob: if you have a level bigger than 40

 ZarthaxX: nono
 ZarthaxX: coffecup
 eulerscheZahl: java coffee guy
 ZarthaxX: that knight dude
 CyberLemonade: oh yeye
 ZarthaxX: was gonna say it didnt seem like an easy one
 ZarthaxX: lol
 CyberLemonade: "was"?
 ZarthaxX: i wanted to say...
 ZarthaxX: was it bruteforceable?
 eulerscheZahl: i even gave feedback on it to make it harder i think. not sure anymore
 ZarthaxX: i didnt try that 
 ZarthaxX: okey..
 ZarthaxX: lol
 CyberLemonade: yes I brute forced it
 ZarthaxX: taking each pair of cuts i both X and Y?
 eulerscheZahl: might be in some languages. mine is O(n^2), n = max(horizontal lines, vertical lines)
 IAmNoob: I discoverd oker Chip Race and i like a lot
 ZarthaxX: thought it was too much
 ZarthaxX: same eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: record deltas in both X and Y and then combine them

 ZarthaxX: ah :P
 ZarthaxX: well then, thanks guys
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure it was much simpler initially
 ZarthaxX: was curious
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't remember what it was
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i do remember
 CyberLemonade: didn't JBM have some chocolate bricking problem?
 ZarthaxX: i mean, i dont think this way of solving it could be counted as easy
 JBM: the goro one
 eulerscheZahl: counting squares but not allowing to merge regions
 CyberLemonade: Goro the gorilla or something
 JBM: goro's not a gorilla lol
 CyberLemonade: yss that one was great
 CyberLemonade: JBM o&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: when did you join the instafluff company?
 ZarthaxX: in the contest
 ZarthaxX: it's just a team..
 eulerscheZahl: i should have changed company too. and school. just to win something
 ZarthaxX: that doesnt sound right..
 ZarthaxX: lol
 struct: Wasnt only the school/company that won?
 eulerscheZahl: or ask the winner if he sells me his bot
 Astrobytes: lol

 Astrobytes: Greetings Zarthberg
 eulerscheZahl: you missed all the :popcorn: ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: wdym?
 eulerscheZahl: selling bots
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes im running out of names
 ZarthaxX: i saw it
 ZarthaxX: the girl one
 ZarthaxX: disqualified
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Astrobytes: Get creative Zarthatron
 ZarthaxX: saw the msg you pasted of the chat with her
 ZarthaxX: i laughed so much dude
 eulerscheZahl: names for what? variables?
 ZarthaxX: naming astrobyto
 eulerscheZahl: do it like my school teacher: a,b,c,d,e,...
 Astrobytes: I come up with new names for Zarthahoolie here, and he is running out of ideas for AStrobytes
 ZarthaxX: lmao eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: lets go with Astrobynomical
 Astrobytes: I like that :thumbsup:
 ZarthaxX: this game is getting harder and hardear :P
 Illedan: What game? :P 
 eulerscheZahl: naming game
 IAmNoob: lol
 Illedan: oh

 IAmNoob: i will

 eulerscheZahl: the highest ranked by hand solver is uljahn with 100 levels
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)))
 CyberLemonade: wow
 eulerscheZahl: 363? :o
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't aware that so many looked into number shifting already
 CyberLemonade: well the concept was first of its kind
 eulerscheZahl: wait, there are 155 only&#160;:(
 CyberLemonade: I got to level 10, sadly lost my code
 IAmNoob: no...
 IAmNoob: there are 363
 Astrobytes: I'm 21st, stopped at level 65, by hand
 IAmNoob: and i am the 155th
 eulerscheZahl: ah, now i know where you got the 363
 IAmNoob:&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: some clicked "play" but never submitted
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)0
 eulerscheZahl: 65 levels by hand is still impressive
 IAmNoob: but istill wrote 1000 lines
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan where is the app? :P
 CyberLemonade: what app?
 Astrobytes: I can probably do more, I forgot about it :P
 CyberLemonade: and did anyone manage to break the codes?

 eulerscheZahl: reverse the seed by looking at the levels. than he knew the solution as i start building the levels on a solved board
 Illedan: Ah, yeah on my list of items to finish
 eulerscheZahl: now i use SecureRandom

 Snef: from your game
 eulerscheZahl: if there is no one listed on the leaderboard: no
 eulerscheZahl: for a single testcase? no
 Snef: no global, to kinda create a leaderboard
 Astrobytes: CyberLemonade not much for a solver I guess
 Snef: leaderboard is really the missing thing for his game..
 CyberLemonade: I can't access chat with IDE open, is this universal or just me&gt;
 CyberLemonade:&#160;?*
 Astrobytes: Just you I think
 eulerscheZahl: not possible then
 eulerscheZahl: they even removed the chat from preview arenas :o
 eulerscheZahl: that's a good thing. too easy to click a link to an external website and reveal a hidden game with your referrer
 Astrobytes: Oh my bad, just refreshed. Gone indeed. Sorry CyberLemonade
 CyberLemonade: I'm too lazy to report it
 eulerscheZahl: it's not a bug. it's a feature!
 Astrobytes: It may well be a feature, who knows
 CyberLemonade: whyyy
 eulerscheZahl: these private contributions are for contest creation
 CyberLemonade: it's such a nice distraction
 struct: What resolution CyberLemonade?
 CyberLemonade: struct 1080p, zoom 100%

 eulerscheZahl: i did relatively well in the last topcoder marathon, chances for a tshirt

 eulerscheZahl: nice!
 kovi: wow
 Csipcsirip: is it possible / worth it to join only the last stage&#160;?

 ZarthaxX: riddles?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 reCurse: From experience you need to keep poking people every 2 months or so

 kovi: covid is just peaked in russia
 eulerscheZahl: raic already announced shipping within 2 weeks. then corona happened
 CyberLemonade: Is the lockdown over in Germany?
 eulerscheZahl: we never had a full lockdown
 CyberLemonade: or did they just start bundesliga like that

 MSmits: struct its impossible to tell, i would not say "most like" 
 CyberLemonade: yes
 CyberLemonade: more like most definitely
 MSmits: it's just a possibility, noone knows
 struct: im from the future
 eulerscheZahl: "Ihr seid doch die dümmsten Kälber, wählt euch eure Metzger selber" (Edmund Stoiber, German politician)translation without rhyme: you are the dumbest calfs, electing your own butchers
 MSmits: trump will get less votes&#160;% than he did last time i think, but the electoral system is pretty bad
 MSmits: also they can hack the voting machines
 MSmits: what did he say this about eulerscheZahl?
 MSmits: or who
 eulerscheZahl: said that on his campaign to his potential voters :D
 eulerscheZahl: they were not amused
 MSmits: err no
 CyberLemonade: that's not cool
 CyberLemonade: sounds pretty badass
 Astrobytes: Similar to "turkeys voting for Christmas"
 eulerscheZahl: in the region where he said that, other parties are more popular than him
 Insufficient: they should make that a kaggle problem - predict the us election outcome by seat
 MSmits: Astrobytes I honestly dont know whether you are referring to the bird or the country
 Astrobytes: The bird, lol
 eulerscheZahl: german vote counting has been proven to be vulernable too. we still have manual counting of paper votes for official results. but the electronic system has flaws
 MSmits: who eats a turkey on christmas?
 MSmits: did they win the vote?
 Astrobytes: Not me. It's just an expression.
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Astrobytes: Turkeys are traditionally eaten in certain places at Christmas.
 MSmits: I see
 CyberLemonade: India also has manual counting in many constituencies
 AntiSquid: lol with the electronic system everyone will either blame it on russian / chinese / mexican bots if their fav candidate doesn't win
 AntiSquid: electronic voting system *
 MSmits: thats what is worrisome
 eulerscheZahl: we have electronic counting for fast results. and manual for official results
 eulerscheZahl: but the manual results are 2-3 weeks after
 AntiSquid: do you believe in russian bots rigging elections MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: believe? It's not belief. They have been spreading fake stuff on social media. 
 MSmits: it's been pretty well documented  I think
 AntiSquid: i am talking about actually rigging numbers
 Astrobytes: Yup. If I were them it's what I would do.
 MSmits: AntiSquid no idea
 AntiSquid: changing opinions on social media isn't that impressive
 Astrobytes: They just have to meddle, the rest takes care of itself.
 MSmits: it's in Russia's best interest to not have Trump as president
 Astrobytes: Cyberwarfare etc
 MSmits: a deranged lunatic with nukes at his fingertips... 
 AntiSquid: using other country's easy to manipulate people to change election result isn't really cyberwarefare
 reCurse: They know he's all talk
 Astrobytes: Since he's a fking idiot he's also handy to have on your side, swings both ways MSmits
 reCurse: No threat whatsoever
 MSmits: if any of the stuff they have on him leaks out, he may have a screw you moment
 MSmits: he's old, he rages
 MSmits: it happens
 reCurse: All bark no bite
 MSmits: kind of a tough thing to gamble with, even if there is a 1% chance he flips out, its not worth it
 Astrobytes: The only mushroom shaped thing you'll get with trump is... no I won't continue
 reCurse: He's doing a great job dissolving the "western alliance", what's not to like
 AntiSquid: quite sure pretty much all of the murican gov is corrupt, it's all about business and money over there anyway
 Astrobytes: And not here AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: ya, but i like to look at the neighbour's lawn first
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: "He's doing a great job"and that's where he would stop to read
 MSmits: not sure what the UK is like, but in many western European countries there's plenty of people in politics that are not corrupt and trying to do a good job
 MSmits: in the US as well I think, there are just too few
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid "using other country's easy to manipulate people to change election result isn't really cyberwarefare" - No, but they actively engage in it, to cause disruption. Everyone does.
 AntiSquid: propaganda was always an issue
 Astrobytes: *is
 MSmits: as soon as a country stops investing in education, this starts to be more of a problem
 Insufficient: there's a fun dramatization of brexit on netflix btw where they allude to the way targetted marketing found non voters and got them to vote
 AntiSquid: uni in merica results in life long debt afaik :D
 MSmits: seems like it
 Astrobytes: All the shenanigans behind Brexit are very interesting. And related to Trump campaign. And Russia. It's great.
 MSmits: half of them just dont believe education and healthcare as rights
 NickStahl: You should watch "The great hack" on Netflix
 NickStahl: It really shines a light on how Brexit and Trump could win...
 Scarfield: there is this danish tech guy who made an episode about the "security" of the american election. i was honestly shocked watching it
 MSmits: this corona crisis is really going to wreck the US. If the health situation is bad, wait till millions of people get kicked out of their homes
 eulerscheZahl: wait for tornado season
 NickStahl: 1/5th got fired :thinking:
 MSmits: thats just a few states though
 eulerscheZahl: you can't put everyone in a basketball hall now
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: the sad thing is, even if they try to fix things and spend lots of money to do so, the system is corrupt enough that a big chunk will be funneled to people that are already ruch
 MSmits: rich
 AntiSquid: "To be honest I had very low motivation to deal with incomplete information, as it was the third contest in a row with this kind of stuff and this time it felt way harder than usual to bruteforce the enemy possibilities and prune them to only keep the valid ones." - haha i like the PMs
 KAIn: gratz for taking over on #1 (again), eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: but CG had nearly 5k&#160;! so maybe next contest should have incomplete info :D
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 MSmits: I would play anyway
 reCurse: You'd fit well in marketing
 AntiSquid: who
 reCurse: You
 AntiSquid: ok 
 AntiSquid: i will take that as a compliment
 eulerscheZahl: it wasn't
 MSmits: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: You'd have to change name to Antitrust though
 cegprakash: hey I"m streaming shortly

 Astrobytes: I did some streaming of my own earlier cegprakash, drank a lot of water today
 k4ng0u: eulerscheZahl false manipulation will repost qsqp
 k4ng0u: asap
 cegprakash: aw I missed
 Astrobytes: whoosh :P It was a crude joke ceg, sorry 
 AntiSquid: cegprakash water stream he drank lots of water 
 struct: Where is the stream?
 cegprakash: 1 min
 cegprakash: same link
 cegprakash: all set

 struct: 154 moves in 1 turn
 struct: not on that list though
 cegprakash: hey
 cegprakash: can u hear me on stream
 Illedan: Sure
 MSmits: in space, noone can hear you stream
 struct: ceg dont forget there is referee available
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 struct: oh god how will i test all these moves&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: With your sim, presumably
 struct: I dont trust my sim
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: hahaa, well now, might have to manually apply each move 
 struct: But I see repeating moves&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, this game is your nemesis
 eulerscheZahl: and i suggested it. so i broke struct?
 struct: no, your suggestion was good
 struct: My first releae of the game was bad
 struct: very bad
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's just you've given him an everlasting task
 struct: Now i have 2 options
 struct: remove duplicates
 struct: or fix the code :D
 eulerscheZahl: are you sure there are no missing moves?
 struct: yes
 ProDCG: Hi
 struct: "yes"
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Get some additional programmers to help you with your late project struct, that *always* works...
 struct: If a programmer sees my code
 struct: he quits coding
 reCurse: So you quit coding? Or you're not a programmer?
 eulerscheZahl: but you need consultants, not just any programmers
 struct: Im not a programmer
 Astrobytes: I was just referencing Brooks' Law
 struct: Ill fix code properly
 struct: I still have time
 Astrobytes: An entire lifetime
 eulerscheZahl: you know how to create new accounts
 jacek: well chat is gone when ide is open
 Astrobytes: We all know
 jacek: yet here you are

 kovi: bug or feature?
 jacek: reBlessing

 jacek: finally no distraction
 Trice: Can I have some help with code royale?
 Trice: I can't solve it...
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN your job
 AutomatonNN: :by
 Astrobytes: Perhaps Automaton2000 can help
 Automaton2000: i tried some kind of weird
 Astrobytes: Trice, it's not really something you 'solve' as such
 jacek: you can solve chess but not code royale?
 Astrobytes: Go solve Code Royale then :P
 Trice: :D
 eulerscheZahl: he's still busy solving chess
 Trice: I have some problem with the moving
 struct: I think I found the bug
 eulerscheZahl: is it fixable without full rewrite?
 Trice: Can't beat some players, after i was able to beat the bot
 Astrobytes: What's the movement issue Trice?
 struct: I think its fixed
 struct: :p
 dbf: chat window is not available now when ide is open. anyone was able to fix it?
 eulerscheZahl: reported on the discord bug channel
 Astrobytes: Reported it on Discord earlier dbdr, seems like a bug
 Astrobytes: damn you euler :P
 dbf: great thanks, will go to vote for it&#160;:)

 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: help me on my stream
 cegprakash: for BitRunner
 struct: What help do you need'
 struct:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: euler didn't play BR cegprakash
 AntiSquid: cegprakash when you fail on stream learn from the pros, stop stream and erase all evidence, then deny it ever happened
 JBM: i KNEW it
 Astrobytes: Hmmm... wonder where I saw that before... :thinking: :P
 k4ng0u: can you achieve a good bitrunner score without a solid sim from csb?
 Astrobytes: Sim fully required.
 k4ng0u: (I mean without days/weeks/months of work)
 AntiSquid: get your sim from bit runner instead! no need for csb
 Astrobytes: And I think there were some differences in the engine from CSB, nothing too major... been a while, can't remember
 Astrobytes: Sim's easy enough to implement, referee is nice and clear
 k4ng0u: Antisquid how fast can that been done (if you are an average programmer I mean)
 AntiSquid: idk&#160;?! there's a referee no?
 AntiSquid: i mean it's still easier to read than UTG and it didn't take me long to understand UTG referee
 Astrobytes: Yeah, converting it to C++ isn't hard
 struct: not long k4ng0u
 Astrobytes: Assuming you were wanting C++ k4ng0u
 cegprakash: i'm gonna delete all the evidence
 struct: What happened ceg?
 cegprakash: BitRunner never came to my life
 Astrobytes: The CG remembers cegprakash
 AntiSquid: you should say stuff like "what evidence?" instead of that cegprakash
 k4ng0u: let's suppose you are ok in C++ (not the best but an ok dev) how much  time would it take to come out with a good sim?
 AntiSquid: depends how motivated i feel
 cegprakash: I saw the sim
 struct: Do you have experience in CSB/FB?
 cegprakash: it was just pos + velocity
 Astrobytes: Couple of hours
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/Bit-Runner-2048/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java">https://github.com/Illedan/Bit-Runner-2048/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java</a>
 cegprakash: check the move function
 cegprakash: but it doesn't work that way
 Astrobytes: IF you are motivated enough
 AntiSquid: 1-2 days really, but i hate writing sims so maybe i would just implement it piece by piece
 cegprakash: something fishy
 struct: It works that way
 cegprakash: I print target - velocity
 cegprakash: but it doesn't move properly
 AntiSquid: i mean max 1-2 days ... i don't really like physics games
 struct: -?
 struct: target - velocity?
 k4ng0u: that's pretty sick, I am guessing most ppl were not that much into recent games as the sim would probably take less time to make
 k4ng0u: despite that only a few were legends
 cegprakash: my target is always origin unless enemy is bringing a prisoner to center
 struct: k4ng0u its preety hard to get legend on BR
 AntiSquid: pacman was a good game imo
 cegprakash: when I decide to thrust at full speed towards prisoner
 AntiSquid: despite the RNG
 cegprakash: but it doesn't work as I intended struct
 cegprakash: I quit
 Astrobytes: Yeah, BR has *proper* bosses
 cegprakash: BitRunner referee is probably buggy
 struct: sure
 Astrobytes: ffs ceg
 struct: Is never your fault right?
 struct: I have perfect simulation, with no off by 1 errors
 AntiSquid: k4ng0u a lot of the java code can just be copied into c++ and then slightly modified to wrok
 MSmits: yeah just switch the o and the r and its fine
 Astrobytes: Then get optimising :P
 cegprakash: oh wait I'm rank 20 and climbing
 cegprakash: why did I close the stream
 Astrobytes: Because you're a complete... ceg
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: i thought you were going to burn the stream and hide the dead witnesses 
 struct: if you want to stream wood to legend do FB
 struct: 130 lines javascript legend ezpz
 cegprakash: FB I'm doing this weekend
 AntiSquid: why did you stream with no preparation?
 AntiSquid: br2k isn't easy for sure
 struct: Should have used AVX ceg
 MSmits: it is definitely not easy
 Astrobytes: IS there a bug in the leaderboard ceg?
 MSmits: it was intentionally made to be an advanced botter arena
 MSmits: not for beginners
 Astrobytes: It's a great game
 Astrobytes: Need to go back to it and improve
 cegprakash: okay I'm top 51/181 overall
 cegprakash: not bad I think
 struct: okay i submit and make you 52
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's pretty much an exponential difficulty curve ceg, don't get prematurely excited
 struct: I have massive bug, back to fixing it on Yinsh
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467998291">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467998291</a>
 cegprakash: turn 90 what should I print
 struct: I probably would just be better if I redid
 cegprakash: why are my bots not moving towards enemy cars
 struct: Do you have sim?
 cegprakash: that's so ugly
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: I have an if
 struct: ah right, if is superior now
 AntiSquid: only need 10 lines of ruby
 Astrobytes: The One True AI
 Astrobytes: I strongly suggest you write a sim, and implement a search cegprakash
 JBM: -3... forgot the rest
 Astrobytes: Even csj discovered the benefits of sim + search for BR
 cegprakash: Reaching #50 counts as a gold even though I didn't promote
 Astrobytes: No, it seriously does not
 struct: lol
 struct: you would have been promoted to silver btw
 cegprakash: I take top 20 are legends
 cegprakash: and I'm in gold
 cegprakash: okay Silver is good too
 Astrobytes: Top 5 are in 'Legend', Wood 1
 cegprakash: my stream goal was Bronze
 Astrobytes: You are in Bronze
 cegprakash: I reached gold!
 AntiSquid: wood
 struct: Nice troll
 Astrobytes: Are you insane?
 AntiSquid: everyone here is
 k4ng0u: Antisquid Astrobytes I don't think it's easy to rank high in bit runners (or even mad max) if you don't have solid knowledge about csb, no? According to me if those sims are easy then most of the recent cg games are trivial as well no?
 Astrobytes: The referee is clear k4ng0u, so CSB knowledge isn't essential I'd say. The hard part of BR is the difficult bosses (They use SmitsiMax at varying depths)
 cegprakash: #12 with depth 1
 cegprakash: I'm happy
 Astrobytes: Also, in BR, you can output "debug" once and you can check your sim collisions against the referee collisions (very useful)
 Astrobytes: ceg, you are 47th
 cegprakash: #12 in wood1
 struct: *gold
 cegprakash: sorry wood4
 struct: *gold
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: You are in Bronze equivalent ceg
 struct: No, he didnt get promoted due to referee bug
 struct: He is gold
 Astrobytes: No LB bug this time :thinking:
 struct: I wonder he did mentioned that he didnt got promoted
 struct: Might report it on bug-report
 AntiSquid: k4ng0u i don't see the difference, you use the sim to simulate an action, if it's hard or not is besides the point, but after you get that shit ported from the referee bug free you just apply the usual meta heuristic of choice
 AntiSquid: also CSB knowledge doesn't help with mean max since it's very different approach imo 
 Astrobytes: ^

 cegprakash: I'll code messi and ronaldo

 cegprakash: how they pass each other
 cegprakash: even though Ronaldo is selfish
 Astrobytes: I'm only silver in FB anyway, didn't get around to sim+search yet
 cegprakash: I am already top 100 gold without sim
 cegprakash: imagine if I add a sim
 Astrobytes: Imagine.
 struct: Im legend with 130 lines

 Snef: Hey guys i have a question for smithimax&#160;:If player 0 choose an illegal movei wanted to backprop a score of -1.0 for him but then what should i backprop for player 1&#160;? 0.0&#160;?
 Illedan: Never allow illegal moves
 Illedan: Makes no sense for player 1 to "learn" from an invalid move of p0 :P
 Snef: it was easier for me to do like this first
 Astrobytes: Not sure illegal moves make *anything* easier&#160;;)
 Snef: i mean when i create childs i don't have the gamestate
 Illedan: What game?
 Snef: the JBM demo
 Illedan: Got link again?
 JBM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/84238477bff184d6523d9b7b6a0dd0790496d8">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/84238477bff184d6523d9b7b6a0dd0790496d8</a>
 Snef: should i compute the gamestate to create only valid moves&#160;?
 Astrobytes: That doesn't seem appropriate for a Smitsi Snef
 Astrobytes: MCTS perhaps
 Snef: illegal move doesn't depends on opponent behavior so it's fine for smitsimax i guess
 CowZow: Hey what is smithimax? I would like to learn it&#160;:)

 CowZow: ah thank you
 Snef: sort of mcts but one tree per agent
 Astrobytes: Hm yeah wait, it's simultaneous
 Astrobytes: OT but Illedan, when will Search Race be finished?
 Snef: to avoid illegalmove i should then compute a part of the game state when creating childs  ?
 Snef: i could store it in the node i guess..
 Illedan: Tomorrow Astrobytes
 Illedan: Soon done with debug mode
 Illedan: and then I will try to see if I can fix something on the graphics
 Illedan: Before I move to ready
 Astrobytes: Nice Illedan, good stuff
 struct: Well I think I  found the bug
 struct: I was adding stones to action
 struct: and then i removed stone on undo action

 Illedan: So simple, yet funny :P
 Illedan: Is the contribution public btw?
 Astrobytes: Funny or fun Illedan?
 JBM: yeah i didn't want to have to take 5h to write the I/O section
 JBM: that's my riterion nowadays

 JBM: but it's no secret, i even posted it on the forum
 struct: Illedan delete
 Illedan: Not too good for ongoing multi
 Illedan: But would be very fun for a 4 hour contest, where no code is run until the end
 JBM: that's part of the debate yes
 Illedan: to see what people would do
 Illedan: :D
 JBM: it's probably very meta-sensitive
 Illedan: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Suggest ways to make it more multi-friendly
 struct: I think its perfect for contest
 Illedan: hence let everyone code something for 4 hours
 JBM: but is that really a problem? :D
 struct: heuristics might do well
 struct: no search required
 Snef: finally a multi for real IA
 Astrobytes: lol

 DragonJ: I win against boss 90% of time and am still rank 19k
 DragonJ: in CSB
 JBM: fix it
 DragonJ: why is the current x and y giving me my next x and y?
 DragonJ: nevermind it was just a glitch
 DragonJ: what would you expect this to do: myPod.getV()
 DragonJ: in CSB
 Xlos: get velocity
 Xlos: Are you looking at my code xd
 Xlos: velocity is the difference between this turns position and last turns position
 DragonJ: yeah and storing is being a pain
 reCurse: I expect a compilation error because that's not part of the starting code
 DragonJ: Python is being a pain ugh
 JBM: that's what it's here for
 DragonJ: like even the for loops aren't working
 Xlos: You can see my whole code if it's confusing you, I have the y coordinates flipped <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/FLGcNmf9">https://pastebin.com/FLGcNmf9</a>
 Xlos: Also python is the least painful lanugage how can you hate on it
 JBM: try me
 DragonJ: I dont hate it , just nothing I try seems to work ugh
 Xlos: Python has short and pretty syntax
 JBM: short?!
 Xlos: Yeah
 reCurse: Least painful? You just didn't try hard enough yet
 Xlos: The only problem is it's slow
 JBM: or, at all
 Xlos: Python doesn't have to deal with memory allocation like c++
 JBM: is that the "short" or "pretty" argument?
 reCurse: Yes it does, it's just doing it insidiously behind the scenes
 reCurse: Where as C++ is very upfront
 Xlos: The points is you don't see it so it's simple
 reCurse: The point is you don't see it so it backstabs you when you least expect it
 Xlos: Everything in python has short name unlike java, min instead of math.min
 JBM: i think i see the apparent simplicity it claims
 reCurse: #define m std::min
 Xlos: That's bad practice though
 Xlos: Also python list comprehension is cool af
 reCurse: If you don't like performance sure
 reCurse: hate it even
 Xlos: I don't use python because it is slow
 JBM: python's list comprehensions are a badly-syntaxed subset of haskell's monad comprehensions
 Xlos: Though, it's fast for machine learning and stuff if you use numpy
 JBM: so it's not fast?
 Xlos: No it's slow
 reCurse: If you sufficiently defer all your calculations so you deal with actual python as little as possible, I guess
 Xlos: For Competitive programming
 reCurse: But the same would be true for every other language
 JBM: are you good at competitive programming?
 Xlos: I would say so
 JBM: cause i don't usually see python in the top ranks
 Xlos: Yup, since it's slow
 DragonJ: horribly slow...
 Xlos: A lot of high level problems differentiate between like n^2log(n) and n^3, so python means you get TLE also surely
 DragonJ: 1+1=(never finds 2 as answer)
 Xlos: Oh another reason it's good is that
 Xlos: I mean, bigint is the same as smallint
 JBM: that's probably a big slowness cause
 JBM: indeed
 Xlos: Well, it doesn't switch to bigint until you overflow so it's actually not that big of a problem
 JBM: it's still a check per operation
 DragonJ: I still cant get python to store shit
 JBM: no it deals with bits usually
 Xlos: I forget exactly how it works that may be true
 JBM: dunno if it's true
 JBM: but i know it can't be false
 DragonJ: If I cant use arrays for storing ints what should I use?
 JBM: batch tape
 Xlos: Well there is an overflow bit set in integers when you do the computations by the hardware, so the check if if a bit is set, which may not change the time
 JBM: check, conditional branch
 JBM: not saying it's slow per se
 JBM: it's just slower than not doing it
 Xlos: In any case that's not the reasons it's slow, it's more because of JIT or something
 JBM: and we're not counting the pre-op part yet
 JBM: the "should i perform a smallint of bigint add on this? lemme check" part
 JBM: "oh, and what about the other operand"
 DragonJ: how is that possible! it is saying that storing an array of strings is suddenly numbers again what????
 reCurse: Enjoy dynamic typing
 reCurse: It's "something"
 JBM: we like to call it "variant" typing nowadays
 JBM: even C++ got it ^^
 JBM: thank god for opt-in
 DragonJ: dude defining x as [[],[]] is still not making it an array
 Xlos: Well you are entitled to your own opinion, I think that python was firs on a survey of 'languages people would most want to program in again' though
 JBM: reminds me of this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/cross_language_interference.pdf">http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/cross_language_interference.pdf</a>
 DragonJ: I program worse in python&#160;;)
 JBM: don't say that
 JBM: *everybody* programs worse in python!
 reCurse: Good thing I don't pick programming languages by popular opinion :P
 DABOI: Is python easy to learn?
 Xlos: Well I've done quite a lot with at least 5 and for me personally python is my favorite
 JBM: fair enough
 Xlos: Most people I know agree python is the easiest common one to learn
 JBM: you might suffer from selection bias
 Xlos: That's why I referenced the survey first
 JBM: though i possibly wouldn't disagree with you on that
 DragonJ: python is easy to learn if you can get it to store stuff
 DragonJ: which I cant seem to do&#160;:/ 
 Xlos: What about [] isn't working for you
 Xlos: Or, what are you trying to do
 DragonJ: trying to store each x value so I can get the turns velocity
 Xlos: DO you need an array for that or only the last turn?
 DragonJ: I just want something that can store currently nothing is working
 Xlos: For an array, do a =[], then a.insert(element)
 Xlos: err a.append()
 Xlos: Then you can access the last element with a[-1]
 DragonJ: apparently it wants the index so I cant do that
 DragonJ: will try append now
 DragonJ: thanks
 DragonJ: will write that down 
 DragonJ:&#160;:)

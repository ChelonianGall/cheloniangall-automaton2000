 KiwiTae: o/
 KiwiTae: in c++ the last element of a vector is at v.end()-1?
 DaNinja: yes, or v.back()
 Sayach8: iterator to the last element is v.end()-1 and the last element is v.back()
 KiwiTae: no wonder the rand segfault in my code :joy:
 jacek: or v.begin()+v.size()-1
 dirty_code: does (v.size()-1 == v.end()-1)&#160;?
 KiwiTae: thanks
 jacek: end is iterator, size is some in
 jacek: t
 dirty_code: will the comparison work?
 jacek: no, theyre not the same
 jacek: id say iterator is more like pointer to address (though not accurate)

 jacek: im not dice master, i wouldn't notice it if not for dicefield
 eulerscheZahl: well, I noticed it too. just too late and now i don't want to do the work again
 jacek: ah well lets see what the approvers will say
 eulerscheZahl: i will bribe them
 AntiSquid: omg that ruins like the entire experience for me and AutomatonNN, just redo it
 AutomatonNN: hello MadKnight
 MadKnight: AutomatonNN don't ping me ping euler
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: redo it? :scream:i suck at blender, was happy that I managed to center the cube at 0 and change the color
 AntiSquid: was a joke
 AntiSquid: i don't think it's a "suck at blender" issue, blender isn't easy
 eulerscheZahl: and it crashed a few times when I wanted to edit the dice
 jacek: AutomatonNN pinging other people?
 AutomatonNN: MadKnight you are saying that they are too strong by someone else
 jacek: oh my

 Illedan: What are you making eulerscheZahl?
 jacek: backgammon 3d?
 Illedan: Why the die?
 jacek: because everyone has to die
 Illedan: Word
 eulerscheZahl: dice on a chess board, 6 per player
 eulerscheZahl: you can roll them by exactly as many cells as the number on the die
 eulerscheZahl: if you end your turn on another die, you trow it
 eulerscheZahl: throw
 eulerscheZahl: it's hard to find a chess board. saw a nice one but it came without textures and just told me to download those somewhere else
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea how to apply textures in blender
 Illedan: Cool
 eulerscheZahl: and i want A-H and 1-8 at the edges which further limits my choices
 jacek: dice + chess? w00t
 eulerscheZahl: "One or more textures on this 3D-model have been created with images from Textures.com. These images may not be redistributed by default. Please visit www.textures.com for more information."

 jacek: :s
 AntiSquid: to apply textures in blender you have to import the images into resources and then edit the object texture, select add texture and then there are a million options to adjust look based on texture :D
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like what I was expecting
 eulerscheZahl: and first i have to find a good texture
 jacek: to think i had lectures about blender
 jacek: i needed to pick up some subject and it was the most sane option
 eulerscheZahl: then make me a chess board. i won't pay you btw
 jacek: i know nothing of this 'chess'

 eulerscheZahl: and all because CG has to scramble URLs on upload :sigh:
 jacek: what does drunken mean
 eulerscheZahl: old text, the spinning was completely off at first
 eulerscheZahl: going up, rotating around another axis
 jacek: so flashy when you look from top
 eulerscheZahl: anyone who knows a bit of blender? the board is way too shiny. and when i try a different render, it's fine inside blender but in the browser there's no texture at all

 eulerscheZahl: also: did you use any image files as textures? did you have problems on upload to find the URL?

 eulerscheZahl: those say: get 3 dice in a row (2 own, 1 opponent) and they must have 3 consecutive numbers
 eulerscheZahl: there is no capturing
 eulerscheZahl: my version will have capturing, last man standing
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: you can roll a die exactly as many tiles at the number initially shows
 AntiSquid: that's an odd one, so do diagonals count?
 eulerscheZahl: and must not cross your own path. but you can roll around corners
 eulerscheZahl: diagonals are not direct neighbors
 eulerscheZahl: and i might randomly block some cells so you have to move around
 eulerscheZahl: the iron dice :D
 Astrobytes: Iron Die eh, very Iron Sky. So German :PCool you're porting this one though.Also, hello.
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 Scarfield: DicestroBytes
 Astrobytes: Might not be around much this next week or so, my poor old grandad has finally gone to play chess with the grandmasters of oblivion.
 eulerscheZahl: those of you who missed the discussion earlier the day: do you notice anything on the game so far?

 Astrobytes: ah just got it, much better.
 Astrobytes: Fine as it is.
 AntiSquid: valhalla chess! 
 AntiSquid: my condolences 
 Astrobytes: Thanks guys. It's better this way for him.
 eulerscheZahl: didn't he have dimentia?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Alzheimer's. He basically had organ failure due to that for a few days, we sat with him until the end. RIP
 UnnamedCodinGamer: sorry to hear that
 AntiSquid: forgot how old my grandma is 90 - 91&#160;? still no dementia
 Scarfield: it sounds like a "good" passing all considered then
 Astrobytes: He was 91 AntiSquid. You win some you lose some eh.
 Astrobytes: Yes Scarfield, in the end it is.
 eulerscheZahl: mine was more and more confused at the end. didn't find the way back from the toilets to the table in a restaurant, watering the plastic flowers multiple times a day and such
 Scarfield: euler the numbers on the dies opposite faces must sum to 7 (not sure if you saw my message yesterday)
 Astrobytes: Anyway, he taught me chess.
 eulerscheZahl: Scarfield won that quiz
 Astrobytes: So I owe him a lot!
 eulerscheZahl: jacek saw it too. but i'm not in a mood to find a better asset
 Astrobytes: Aha, yes indeed. I didn't look close
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: checked the chat logs from yesterday. seems you mentioned it right after I went to bed Scarfield
 jacek: at 20:05?
 eulerscheZahl: and this morning i realized it myself with big disbelieve
 eulerscheZahl: more like 20:30 i think
 eulerscheZahl: so today i'm already late again
 Astrobytes: Shocking behaviour euler&#160;:)
 Illedan: Euler awake? :O
 Scarfield: what is all this with the 5%&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 90 in july, just checked lolastro, ah he's gone
 jacek: where
 eulerscheZahl: who's gone?
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes didn't autocomplete for me 
 Astrobytes: I'm gone?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: yes
 jacek: does AutomatonNN autocomplete?
 AutomatonNN: why do you think that you can see the task in the code?
 Scarfield: did auto so only explanation
 Scarfield: didn't*
 Astrobytes: I've transcended autocompletion
 Scarfield: who is this astro impersonator, and what have you done to the real one?
 AntiSquid: must be an imposter from Taured
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm really from Dimension A
 Astrobytes: Anyway, what's hot this weekend?
 Scarfield: had to call police on my neighbour late last night
 AntiSquid: oof
 Scarfield: small party, they started fighting loudly, someone pulls a knife (they shouted about it), called police.. some friends my neighbour has 
 Astrobytes: lol, nice
 jacek: and they werent wearing masks!?
 Astrobytes: Admittedly, it only takes one/two weirdos to show up (friends of a friend) to turn things sour 
 Astrobytes: But still, wtf
 AntiSquid: thought only UK had knife problems
 AntiSquid: (and spoons judging by certain pictures)
 Scarfield: they werent wearing masks no, that was the real reason i called

 AntiSquid: i rather read the disclosed CIA UFO files which are half crossed out with dark marker pen
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I left CG open while i slept..it's up to 2.3GB of memory
 ZarthaxX: lol wtf
 Astrobytes: Speaking of cat cults, the one in my avatar likes to sleep next to my head at night and the purring she makes reminds me of the Ewok chanting when they're worshipping C3P0 in Return of the JEdi.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops sorry that is Facebook
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG is ok

 Astrobytes: Aha. Hot topic for everyone rn it seems
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Where they move
 Astrobytes: I seriously lack a few of the official CG ones tbh, I should spend some time on that
 Illedan: I had 60&#160;% on this and wanted to try from scratch again as a break to other stuff
 Astrobytes: Yeah, makes sense. I tend to get bogged down in one multi or subject and neglect everything
 Illedan: same
 Illedan: Stopped myself from doing any multies until I manage to grasp something in the RL world
 Astrobytes: Focus is always a good thing&#160;:)
 Illedan: Indeed

 PatrickMcGinnisII: korean netflix is kinda PG
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Space Sweepers is badass
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I  confuse korean and chinese sometimes, sorry

 AntiSquid: space sweepers is alright i guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My GF comes over and she hears non-english on the tv and of course I have to change it

 heloche:&#160;:;p
 heloche: :p
 AntiSquid: got to watch the high quality stuff i guess, watch anime with dub i guess
 Astrobytes: Oh what do I care anyway, post your clash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: She won't watch Dust on YT either
 heloche: dafaq?
 Astrobytes: Project A-Ko
 AntiSquid: did you watch rick and morty&#160;?
 MSmits: just rick
 Astrobytes: (don't watch Project A-ko btw)
 AntiSquid: i mean watch it with your gf PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1986...holy sh*t
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It's a classic. It's also terrible! Though admittedly amusing at times
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Project A-ko (プロジェクトA子, Purojekuto Ēko) is a 1986 Japanese action-comedy science fiction anime film that had several sequels and a spin-off.
 AntiSquid: the first anime my wife watched was gintama, guess because it's funny, even the filler episodes are funny 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think i got her to watch the new godzilla anime... she won't watch parts 2 or 3 tho
 AntiSquid: see if your gf likes hana yori dango
 AntiSquid: i don't watch godzilla :P
 AntiSquid: anyways i find netflix really boring, even the horror movies are dull
 heloche: don't understand a goddam Mikey mouse..
 AntiSquid: i mean the story isn't very engaging, all i can think of is, just die already and get over with it ... except for cabin in the woods maybe, was ok at best, shitty plot twist imo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: horror movies mess with my dreams too much, and all the new ones suck anyways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: K-drama...wait 5 hours...someone might get a kiss on the cheek....smh
 AntiSquid: there was a decent horror movie with timeparadox in it, korean too, forgot the name
 AntiSquid: The Cal
 AntiSquid: Call *
 heloche: back to the future 
 AntiSquid: ya it's very prude, but sometimes funny (kdramas)
 MSmits: so the main character went back in time to stop himself from picking up the phone?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like a serial killer and a girl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sounds familiar
 AntiSquid: no MSmits
 MSmits: hmm but i got close right
 AntiSquid: watch it, it's a good story
 MSmits: if it is on netflix
 AntiSquid: yes it is
 MSmits: np then
 AntiSquid: and i think it has english dub
 MSmits: i hate dub
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The Platform was good, i think it's in portugese tho
 MSmits: I am a lipreader
 MSmits: it bugs me more than robo-hungarian
 AntiSquid: i just hate movies that don't end in a way i'd prefer them to end
 MSmits: i'll just use subtitles
 MSmits: worst ending ever: The Mist miniseries
 MSmits: from the stephen king short story
 AntiSquid: hey PatrickMcGinnisII if you want K-Drama where they go beyond just kissing you could watch handmaiden? :P  ok this is a joke, hated the movie actually
 MSmits: or was it a movie
 MSmits: i think it was a movie
 pardouin: well there's a movie for sure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's a norwegian versus of cabin in the woods
 PatrickMcGinnisII: forgot the name
 pardouin: and there is ... no ending
 AntiSquid: i watch a lot of stuff on 2x 3x with browser extension, too dull for me otherwise
 MSmits: i think it has an ending, isnt it that the mist clears up at the end
 AntiSquid: also a reason i use the dub, can't read that fast
 MSmits: oh right, with faster speed it's hard
 pardouin: no basically he sees soldiers coming and he screams and that's it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm half deaf, i read lips too
 AntiSquid: shutter island is on netflix&#160;! :O
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so cc is usually on
 AntiSquid: watch it if you havn't already
 MSmits: pardouin but everyone else is dead, thats kind of an ending. The reason why i think its the worst ending is that he didnt have to kill his family. Stephen King didnt even write that
 MSmits: so they made the ending messed up for no reason
 pardouin: yes he kills everyone and right after the soldiers come lol
 MSmits: yeah, but thats not in the book
 pardouin: dunno why they wanted it so sad
 MSmits: yeah, it bugged the hell out of me
 MSmits: i was like, huh, why!?!?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pardouin Ahhh, the other puzzle XP climber
 pardouin: almost done with the medium ones
 MSmits: nice job
 PatrickMcGinnisII: everyday, i see 'em climb
 MSmits: what are you looking at to see that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html</a>
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I'm 119 not bad&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I wondered if pardouin is the "unnamed player"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: guess not
 pardouin: today I don't remember if i puzzled, was busy with this project:
 pardouin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-2-5d-maze/6919/14">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-2-5d-maze/6919/14</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't do PY much, so ursina is an engine?
 pardouin: yes it's pretty recent but it's cool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: where's the camera angle controls?
 pardouin: and it's opensource so if something is not exactly as you want, you can just customize it, that's what I like
 PatrickMcGinnisII: first person yes?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its in the engine?
 pardouin: yes it's already set up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: interesting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i got 20 minutes to finish puzzle b4 dinner
 pardouin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina/blob/master/ursina/prefabs/first_person_controller.py">https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina/blob/master/ursina/prefabs/first_person_controller.py</a>
 pardouin: what I like is that you can have a working game pretty fast without much settings to do
 pardouin: for example I did a 3D maze generator with multiple floors, the prefab FPC was jumping through roofs so it was bothering me, so I just curstomized the prefab and then it worked exactly as I wanted
 pardouin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/h9ot3Qd.png">https://i.imgur.com/h9ot3Qd.png</a>
 pardouin: there are holes in the ceilings/floors to go from one floor to another, it's pretty cool, and transparent walls to see your position easily
 PatrickMcGinnisII: next level bender
 pardouin: that's when you exit the maze:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/KXWK58L.png">https://i.imgur.com/KXWK58L.png</a>
 pardouin: you can see it from outside
 AntiSquid: fancy looking stuff
 pardouin: I tried with more than 4 floors put it's a pain to find the exit, with 7 floors it takes literally 30 min XD
 dirty_code: how to change default auto generated code on clash of code?
 pardouin: ctrl+A del&#160;?
 pardouin: what do you want exactly?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: isn't it in the stub generator
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: you need to edit stub generator for your contribution
 Astrobytes: My cousin is a stub generator. Smokes 20 a day
 AntiSquid: you can't edit that, can you&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap ran out of time, laterz
 AntiSquid: bb
 AntiSquid: wait there was a song
 AntiSquid: "i am out of time ... something something"
 AntiSquid: not oasis, was some disco-ish song
 Astrobytes: Ride on Time?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0quXl_od3g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0quXl_od3g</a>
 AntiSquid: no
 Astrobytes: Well, I'm outta ideas
 mororo250: how do I advance to bronze in CODERS STRIKE BACK?I already beat the boss 3
 AntiSquid: oh lol i found it, kinda remember the video differently, or maybe i mix it up with a different song 
 AntiSquid: united nations - out of touch Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol, gotcha
 Astrobytes: I'd progressed to this (it was in my history) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ExMknnK3E&amp;t=288s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ExMknnK3E&amp;t=288s</a>
 Astrobytes: eh, timestamp<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ExMknnK3E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ExMknnK3E</a>
 mororo250: it's fine.I think it was a bug
 AntiSquid: has a good beat
 AntiSquid: sounds similar to some other random songs i heard which probably got inspired from it&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: It's from 1993 so yeah probably
 Astrobytes: Similar style from '94 AntiSquid:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kibq1xUarOw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kibq1xUarOw</a>
 AntiSquid: i occasionally open up random radio stations with 90s / 00s music
 AntiSquid: it's kind of a global trend at that point in time i think
 Astrobytes: These two were UK underground rave kinda tunes
 Astrobytes: Anyway. I am shattered. Gn AntiSquid and everyone
 AntiSquid: gn8

 Zenoscave: Neon_Tuts please don't post clash invites in chat
 Zenoscave: people will join if they please
 Neon_Tuts: Ok
 Neon_Tuts: Sorry
 Zenoscave: no worries
 Neon_Tuts:&#160;:)
 Famout: It's silly, being drafted into silver makes me feel the need to actually improve my bot in Ocean. 
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave still trying, you are close :o
 Zenoscave: Not close enough
 eulerscheZahl: oh, boss at 30
 Zenoscave: ~1.5 below
 eulerscheZahl: 1.39
 Zenoscave: right
 eulerscheZahl: and my polar bear is even lower
 Zenoscave: yeah
 Zenoscave: he was doing good for a whil
 Zenoscave: while
 ZarthaxX: i was below boss once lol
 ZarthaxX: ppl started to smash me
 ZarthaxX: :c
 Zenoscave: lol nice work
 eulerscheZahl: you are below the boss all the time
 ZarthaxX: i meant like
 ZarthaxX: second
 ZarthaxX: funny shark
 Zenoscave: second below boss so third?
 ZarthaxX:&#160;??????????????????
 ZarthaxX: 2nd in gold
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 Zenoscave: are you YoB
 eulerscheZahl: if you pass the 2nd on the ladder, what's your rank then?
 ZarthaxX: tob?
 ZarthaxX: yob?
 ZarthaxX: wat
 Zenoscave: yob o
 ZarthaxX: oh guys just stop
 ZarthaxX: im dying here
 eulerscheZahl: so warm?
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: the f
 Zenoscave: because polar bear
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's getting winter for you soon
 Zenoscave: think I'll get bumped this far away?
 eulerscheZahl: possible
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't notably improve, just wait
 Zenoscave: gah I will wait then
 eulerscheZahl: i know it's hard to wait and do nothing
 ZarthaxX: u wont get it
 eulerscheZahl: you have to believe
 Zenoscave: probably not. I am forever gold
 ZarthaxX: i was below and got down 9 positions
 ZarthaxX: this shit is actually impossible
 ZarthaxX: it's already f cold here eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: :C
 ZarthaxX: corona is gonna be happy with that
 ZarthaxX: btw Zenoscave
 ZarthaxX: same code that once reached 2nd , ended like 40
 ZarthaxX: soooooo&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Just gonna break my dreams huh
 ZarthaxX: ye
 ZarthaxX: i want you to suffer
 ZarthaxX: like i am
 ZarthaxX: well u have been suffering more
 ZarthaxX: so im sorry
 Zenoscave: Thanks
 ZarthaxX: this game is savage
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: let's just wait for pacman
 Riyuk: don't hate the game, hate the players :D
 ZarthaxX: i hate u
 ZarthaxX: :c
 ZarthaxX: kidding
 ZarthaxX: love u
 ZarthaxX: im sorry corona is getting me
 eulerscheZahl: you were like this before
 Riyuk: :apple:
 Zenoscave: you were always this way
 Zenoscave: beat me euler
 eulerscheZahl: not in terms of eloquence
 Neon_Tuts: Hello world whats going n?
 Neon_Tuts: *on
 eulerscheZahl: a contest
 Neon_Tuts:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: time to move into my officePC 1 off, PC 2 on...see you
 Zenoscave: ttyl
 Zenoscave: new submit ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: had 14 wins in arow at start
 ZarthaxX: was fun
 ZarthaxX: andd back down
 Famout: Feels weird to bring out recursion, don't use it nearly enough in normal coding. 
 Zenoscave: I see
 ZarthaxX: this is impossible
 ZarthaxX: :c
 Zenoscave: you're gonna bump me right zarhtie?
 Riyuk: Doesn't look so :open_mouth:
 ZarthaxX: mhm
 ZarthaxX: i will try to get to top
 ZarthaxX: funny thing is when i got top before i beated boss 4 time
 ZarthaxX: out of 5
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: my best was 8/16
 ZarthaxX: that's cool
 Zenoscave: this was 2/6
 ZarthaxX: dont u feel its kind of random
 ZarthaxX: like nokidding
 ZarthaxX: i know that if u have a good bot u prob win
 ZarthaxX: but
 ZarthaxX: having a submit reach like 5
 ZarthaxX: and then 40
 ZarthaxX: is weird
 Zenoscave: the deviation is pretty high
 ZarthaxX: yeah the trueskill fails in this one
 Zenoscave: I think you're in range to possibly face me
 Zenoscave: bump incomming please!
 ZarthaxX: i killed boss once
 ZarthaxX: maybe helps
 ZarthaxX: and lost
 ZarthaxX: :c
 ZarthaxX: im sorry
 ZarthaxX: gave u one
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: you lost to me too  ;)
 ZarthaxX: and fed the other dude
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 ZarthaxX: the top is so rough
 ZarthaxX: i fed the boss
 ZarthaxX: want a resubmit?
 Zenoscave: up to you my friend
 ZarthaxX: i will change some tiny things
 ZarthaxX: mhm
 Zenoscave: you may feed boss more. but i'm going to bed now. hopefully i wake up in legend
 Zenoscave: gn
 Zenoscave: was 1.39 below. now 1.38
 ZarthaxX: aight
 ZarthaxX: gn zeno
 ZarthaxX: hope u get it once and for all
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Zenoscave: thx&#160;:+1:

 AntiSquid: zeno again at #2
 AntiSquid: that must feel annoying
 dbdr: size(legend) == 42
 dbdr: definitely closed now&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: zeno will promote
 AntiSquid: and there will be more
 thibpat: :wave: we're live for more Ocean of Code progress <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 AntiSquid: go get legend thibpat
 AntiSquid: :D
 dbdr: not on stream&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: yes on stream, good luck thibpat
 dbdr: that would be chaotic
 lhm: I thought streaming gold+ code was forbidden? Anyways, good luck for legend thibpat&#160;!
 AntiSquid: he doesn't read my comment and i am cheering for him&#160;:(
 dbdr: it is lhm
 AntiSquid: lhm he is not far from top 50 in gold
 dbdr: not sure if it's a formal rule, but defnitely expected not to do it
 AntiSquid: no formal rule
 dbdr: culture also matters
 struct: how many hours did he stream? 24+?
 lhm: AntiSquid yes I know he is not that far from Legend, i'm actually really cheering for him&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: well personally i wouldn't stream past bronze, silver max
 AntiSquid: but now it's top 100 gold already
 AntiSquid: since the "damage" is done, i rather see him go top 10 legend :P
 dbdr: I guess if it's really long, it would be unlikely that many people would watch everything ad copy the whole code *correctly*
 AntiSquid: you don't need to copy, looks like weird spaghetti code
 AntiSquid: you can improve your own bot based on it
 dbdr: I think that might be fine
 dbdr: takes a lot of time to watch, you don't know in advance if it will be worth it
 lhm: Yes, just take the ideas behind his code and do a beter version of it in C++ :3
 AntiSquid: maybe i should fix my threshholds based on his
 dbdr: if he's not taking the 50ms, using C++ will give you nothing
 lhm: dbdr Well you know it is worth now and you can still watch the entire run cant you?
 struct: 17 hours
 dbdr: true. if there is enough time left&#160;;)
 lhm: It might if I try to improve it
 AntiSquid: go at 1.5 speed
 AntiSquid: or maybe 2x&#160;? he doesn't change too much too fast
 dbdr: write software to capture the screen and extract the source code&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: don't need to write
 AntiSquid: just print screen and OCR it
 dbdr: that's only one page
 dbdr: software needs to glue it together
 AntiSquid: uhm, lol waste of time
 dbdr: sure&#160;:)
 lhm: fun project tho
 AntiSquid: i don't know his strategy but going through the video is probably better you know what he is doing
 AntiSquid: which might save you time and just improve based what he does succesfully
 dbdr: sure, but often everything is connected
 dbdr: best values of constants will depend on details of your code behaviour
 AntiSquid: do you want a bot same strength as his or better? 
 dbdr: I don't need to answer that&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: it was a rhetoric question and addressed at nobody in particular
 dbdr: I know&#160;:)
 struct: Ok Im gonna stream
 struct: Legend or delet
 AntiSquid: oh he has an interesting charge sequence, that looks useful :p
 AntiSquid: mine isn't "fine-tuned"
 dbdr: silencing before torpedo?
 struct: Are there situations where its better?
 struct: Besides kill
 AntiSquid: annoy opponent with timeouts?
 dbdr: I do that, but I did not optimize
 struct: you wont timeout with silence torpedo
 struct: maybe if the enemy uses D
 AntiSquid: gold boss not random anymore?
 AntiSquid: still random for me&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: 50% to win on specific seed
 Riyuk: Going to gold finally :smile:
 Riyuk: Where is AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: dbdr was in a contest at the beginning of the contest
 dbdr: thanks for the ping AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by "don't understand the problem?"
 pb4: hey
 pb4: anybody has a seed with lakes in it&#160;?
 pb4: ideally 3 to test stuff
 pb4: struct I'm sure you have that in store :D
 IjustKilledutoo: hello, how is everybody
 Uljahn: pb4: seed=9051324 seed=-1425933
 pb4: thanks&#160;!
 pb4: Uljahn&#160;: my lake detector is officially better than me xD
 pb4: I counted 3 lakes on your first seed
 pb4: lake detector told me there are 4
 pb4: double checked and found the small one in the center :D
 Uljahn:&#160;:)
 kovi: any reason to use lakes? other than starting in biggest one?
 pb4: starting in the biggest one
 pb4: don't have that yet
 Illedan: Assume the opponent is in your lake.. Else you can't kill him anyway
 Illedan: And find him faster
 pb4: oh didn't think about this one&#160;:)
 MichaelPu: nice
 MichaelPu: though aren't lakes rare enough to be negligable?
 pb4: are there many "lake seeds" by the way&#160;?
 Illedan: Not many with lakes of this size afaik
 JanisSerzants: What's incorrect here MOVE E MINE | SONAR 1??
 wlesavo: probably smth else
 tobk: Is there a way to enter a game seed in the online IDE? I remember something like "game options" next to the opponent selection, but can't find it now.
 wlesavo: tobk settings mode expert
 JanisSerzants: TOBK you can sync with IDE press settgins and Use an external code editor
 Neon_Tuts: Hello Everyone :wave:
 dbdr: Illedan: not stricly true, the blast can reach another lake through a corner&#160;:)
 Famout: JanisSerzants guessing you mean that as two separate inputs and not just one? 
 Famout: Oh, I see what you meant, sorry, misread. 
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Nerchio: sup antisquid
 Nerchio: work or bot
 NormantasStankevicius: I love silence spam
 NormantasStankevicius: my predictions jump from 80 to 14000
 NormantasStankevicius: and code brakes down
 Famout: I also don't use any of my guns soooo
 Famout: Getting drafted into Silver via a pacifist run felt like cheating so actually learning to read my foes inputs now. 
 NormantasStankevicius: I just woke up
 Famout: Can't wake up
 NormantasStankevicius: and instantly started to work on code
 NormantasStankevicius: I am addicted
 OncePromise: :grin:

 SpaceCastle: Game use attack annoying strings parsing.
 RavenKZP: *Wake me up inside*
 OncePromise: The purpose of a program is to find the number closest to 0 from a set of numbers. If no number is input, output 0. How to write the code of output 0 without any number input

 tobk: if n == 0 .... else ...&#160;?
 OncePromise: This is the source code. Please modify and add new code on it
 OncePromise: I've run it. It doesn't seem to work
 tobk: sure it does, depends on what you put in the ... though
 Riyuk: wow almost 60 places gain, just by changing a little thing
 aCat: yay, no more timeouts :D
 AWice: zzzzzzzzz clash code
 Riyuk: New submit Illedan :D
 JanisSerzants: I guess torpedos are stronger than mines
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, kinda
 aCat: not exacty
 NormantasStankevicius: it really depends tho
 aCat: torpedos are problematic cause you reveal your position
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah
 NormantasStankevicius: that is why it's kinda
 aCat: so be careful with them&#160;;-)
 NormantasStankevicius: if you torpedo, you have to have a getaway path (Silence)
 NormantasStankevicius: is the best idea
 JanisSerzants: how can a bloody bot predict where I am?
 NormantasStankevicius: math
 JanisSerzants: after 10 moves you can tell I am 6 2, don't think so
 NormantasStankevicius: your spawn
 JanisSerzants: so maybe starting top left is bad idea
 Nerchio: maybe someone is cheating :O
 NormantasStankevicius: :O
 NormantasStankevicius: Scripting?
 NormantasStankevicius: is someone scripting in my game? ohhh my gosh!
 NormantasStankevicius: starting top left is not that good 
 NormantasStankevicius: if you move to the other corner
 NormantasStankevicius: like top left to bot left
 NormantasStankevicius: or top left to top right
 NormantasStankevicius: what league are you Janis?
 JanisSerzants: Javascript
 NormantasStankevicius: league
 NormantasStankevicius: not language
 NormantasStankevicius: silver, wood?
 JanisSerzants: phh 😀 Bronze
 NormantasStankevicius: bronze?
 NormantasStankevicius: ok, I am in silver
 NormantasStankevicius: try to move in a circullar path
 NormantasStankevicius: less locations
 NormantasStankevicius: that the bot can track you
 NormantasStankevicius: You can get to silver with just clever pathing
 NormantasStankevicius: not out of silver tho, I am stuck
 Nerchio: forever silver :cry:
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah
 NormantasStankevicius: I didn't want to implement silence counter
 NormantasStankevicius: but I had to
 NormantasStankevicius: so I worked till 2am and did it
 NormantasStankevicius: now optimizing and reworking some of my code
 Nerchio: nerd
 NormantasStankevicius: hey, u gold
 NormantasStankevicius:  ;&lt;
 Nerchio: i sat a couple of times until 3 am np
 NormantasStankevicius: uptop man
 NormantasStankevicius: bad sleep schedules is the new norm...
 gaha: how do you counter silence?
 gaha: i mean, what is silence counter for you
 Famout: Pathing alone got me to silver, was very silly. 
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah
 NormantasStankevicius: when I look back, it was basically the same
 Famout: Hopefully tell you once I know myself Gaha! 
 Famout: Hoping to touch gold once I get guns online.
 NormantasStankevicius: somewhat same
 NormantasStankevicius: my pathing
 NormantasStankevicius: due to that
 NormantasStankevicius: I had to rework a lot of my code
 Famout: First things first, and honestly most importantly, gotta track my foe. 
 Famout: I was lucky? My pathing, once it "worked" was suboptimal, and I wanted to tighten it down... but was solid enough to reach silver so leaving it alone for now!
 NormantasStankevicius: I did optimize my path
 NormantasStankevicius: but not much difference
 Famout: It's a real hackjob of A* pathfinding, only to find the longest path, and it's weights isn't even good at that. 
 NormantasStankevicius: I feel like notmany people in bronze added proper location prediction
 Famout: I already fear Silence, I think I know how to work around it, but still vastly complicates things. 
 Famout: I got rough sudo code layout done, but since it involves some light recursion it's gonna be fun to make proper. 
 Famout: I also missed the fact more then one command can be given a round, so parsing for many commands is the current task. 
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, I had a simillar thing
 NormantasStankevicius: that was holding me back in wood
 NormantasStankevicius: fixed that
 NormantasStankevicius: I climbed
 NormantasStankevicius: 600spots
 Famout: Thankfully I didn't even touch it and my boat just floated on it's own all this way.
 Famout: I did something right... and/or bribed people at codingame somehow.
 NormantasStankevicius: I think it's the ladder&#160;;)... it's so annoying to implement silence counter (but kinda must), 
 NormantasStankevicius: now I have to rewrite a good portion of my code
 Famout: I'm going in the deep end, and hoping gold doesn't add anything extra since Silver didn't
 NormantasStankevicius: it shouldn't
 NormantasStankevicius: as much as I know, only wood adds new stuff
 Nerchio: if u have mines u have everything
 NormantasStankevicius: most of the time
 Famout: I could have sworn some of the other things added stuff all the way past gold? 
 Famout: I still need to fix my pod racer....
 Famout: Still, nice to know I don't need to keep things too flexible. 
 NormantasStankevicius: no there are some games/bot programming that add up to legend I think
 NormantasStankevicius: but I am not that experienced in CGs, tho my classmates are
 Famout: Yea, that's right, I got a broken pod racer at legend rank.
 Famout: Huh, ego boost there, looks like 97k submissions for CSB, and I'm at 805... broken bot, but still, yay me.
 Dav1dS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings">https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings</a>
 tobk: what's all this about pathing? I just do a quick floodfill to see which moves lead to deadends, which is far from optimal, and still in most games I never have to surface
 AntiSquid: so what do you do vs mines?
 Famout: At the moment? Die.... 
 AntiSquid: tobk
 tobk: not too much. have basic mine tracking, but just try to avoid those cells
 mark7: Hello
 AntiSquid: 1 boss win :o
 Famout: Woo!
 Famout: Wood 1 is also pretty easy, just having a working boat moves you along plenty. 
 NormantasStankevicius: When you are about to leave silver
 NormantasStankevicius: watching your placements is like you are watching horseracing with a bet on it
 NormantasStankevicius: You are invested
 Famout: I mean, ATM I am invested in getting this parser to work correctly so I can track every move.
 C0deLoGgEr: join my clash&#160;!! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1188762a59a181a24bc18db614f551258fdc1b5">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1188762a59a181a24bc18db614f551258fdc1b5</a>
 Famout: Time for sleep, got most parsing working, able to take someone using every command on a turn and still save it.
 ZarthaxX: zenoscave sorry 
 Nerchio: what did u do :D
 NormantasStankevicius: Silver 33/540
 NormantasStankevicius: I can taste gold
 ZarthaxX: not helping him get legend yesterday
 ZarthaxX: now it's impossible
 Nerchio: why its impossible?
 ZarthaxX: top getting super annoying
 AntiSquid: NormantasStankevicius that means nothing
 Famout: It means progress.

 eulerscheZahl: you don't need a direction variable when you have directionX and directionY (which you print in the end)
 Hyslach653: yeah i was just trying things
 Hyslach653: clearly that doesn't work 
 ZarthaxX: hi zen
 ZarthaxX: zenoscave
 Crypticsy: Hey can someone help me figure out how the wire T-P become S-O in the puzzle " Enigma - 3 rotors without plugboard"?
 Crypticsy: XD i am still waiting for someone to look it up
 ZarthaxX: neverdone it srry
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX getting close
 ZarthaxX: meh
 ZarthaxX: not gonna make it
 ZarthaxX: this game just makes u sad
 AntiSquid: when did you start playing it?
 ZarthaxX: 2 daysafter it started
 AntiSquid: ya it's annoying
 ZarthaxX: left for a week ,from gold to legend
 ZarthaxX: didnt do much each day as its too much time
 ZarthaxX: it sucks your life out lol
 AntiSquid: yes
 ZarthaxX: also, this doesnt make sense for me
 ZarthaxX: went to sleeep 8
 ZarthaxX: now im 2nd
 AntiSquid: some promoted
 ZarthaxX: who?
 ZarthaxX: i didnt see any
 AntiSquid: idk
 AntiSquid: are you sure?
 ZarthaxX: of ppl promoting?
 AntiSquid: look ZarthaxX :o
 ZarthaxX: i remember a 42
 ZarthaxX: yeah i saw
 ZarthaxX: still dont give a f lol
 eulerscheZahl: 42 in legend, wa like that 12h ago too
 ZarthaxX: right so no new
 AntiSquid: hm then people changed their bots
 AntiSquid: "fixing" bugs
 ZarthaxX: argentina friendo was last legend i think
 AntiSquid: your sensei 
 eulerscheZahl: beating you again
 ZarthaxX: yeah my sensei
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl u remember last contest
 ZarthaxX: dont u know him? lol
 ZarthaxX: u cant compare
 AntiSquid: i didn't like the last one either&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: oh p´rtomoted
 ZarthaxX: nice
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: told you
 ZarthaxX: mehwas luck
 AntiSquid: skill
 Illedan: Lucky skill?
 AntiSquid: patience skill
 AntiSquid: wait for push at the right time
 ZarthaxX: or maybe dont have any strong ideas to even dare to submit
 ZarthaxX: thanks zenoscave &lt;3
 AntiSquid: now that the fat bear is out of the way you can promote too Zenoscave
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX here's a parting gift:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450704852">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450704852</a>
 Skril: gg ZarthaxX&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: thanks&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid wtf :P
 wlesavo: lol nice
 RavenKZP: can I TRIGGER multiple torpedoes at once?
 wlesavo: no
 RavenKZP: sad
 Illedan: You can trigger mines, not torpedos. And you can only do 1 of each command every round
 AntiSquid: you can also trigger people
 RavenKZP: yh yes i mean mines not torpedos :P
 RavenKZP: AntiSquid I know how to trigger multiple people at once 
 AntiSquid: you get time out if you trigger more than one at a time
 Nerchio: coming to the top boys maybe i will push someone
 Nerchio: xD
 AntiSquid: Just do it! Don't let your dreams be dreams
 Nerchio: zenos owning me
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: push zeno
 ZarthaxX: he needs a rest
 Nerchio: he is #4 so probably not 
 ZarthaxX: and boss?
 Nerchio: didnt have games vs boss yet
 ZarthaxX: what score
 Nerchio: i made my bot a little more consistent so my submits should be better nowe we will see
 Nerchio: this one didnt quite work
 Nerchio: i don't win games vs boulet 
 Nerchio: ever
 Boulet: :D
 Boulet: ty 
 Boulet: helps me so much Nerchio
 Nerchio: ocaml
 Nerchio: wtf
 Boulet: java let me laugh 
 Nerchio: boost nr2 incoming
 Crypticsy: XD has anyone done or read "Enigma - 3 rotors without plugboard"?
 Nerchio: 54/72 matches won not bad ;o
 tobk: why are you always doing "silence 0"? I mean I understand that (a) some bots might not even be aware that that's possible (but probably not in gold anymore) and (b) it takes away the risk of silencing full-speed into some bad situation
 tobk: but if you _always_ do silence 0, isn't that kind of predictable?
 Nerchio: me?
 tobk: no, zarthax and antisquid in their replay, but heard it from others, too
 wlesavo: tobk thats easier, i punish for silence 0, because even in gold its quite common
 wlesavo: in legend i mean
 tobk: sure, every once in a while, my bot silence-3s into a dead-end, but if all the top-bots do silence 0, it kind of gives away their posiiton like not silencing at all...
 wlesavo: you can silence into mine field, thats much worse
 tobk: hm, maybe I should just try it, let's see where it takes me from gold-80, but it feels kind of dumb...
 wlesavo: you can sometimes do other lengths
 wlesavo: in early game preferably
 tobk: what I do: get my "preferred" direction for a regular move, then silence a random amount (including 0) in that direction.
 ZarthaxX: and trap yourself :c
 tobk: yes, sometimes&#160;:-P
 Nerchio: thats why predicting state of the map after the silence is important
 tobk: but again, if you ALWAYS do silence 0, and so many others, too, then maybe I should just ignore the opponent's silence and see where that gets me&#160;:-P
 tobk: (or maybe just put a higher weight/probability  on that position; currently I'm just having a set of possible positions, but no probabilities)
 tomatoes: i rand 0 1 in preferred direction
 Nerchio: my submits so far look like
 ZarthaxX: try tobk
 ZarthaxX: spam submit
 Nerchio: get unlucky first few matches then crawl through the middle of the gold to end around top10 xd
 tobk: I will, but not now. technically stil at work&#160;:-)
 Nerchio: i just beat you tobk u can watch that
 Nerchio: xD
 YannT: 128 matches vs. kovi today
 YannT: man there isn't enough bandwith on the internet for your pushing&#160;:)
 Illedan: haha
 Nerchio: btw matches are not being played unless someone pushes or?
 Illedan: Correct
 ZarthaxX: matches generateon submits
 kovi: yeah, cg servers are doing better todayyesterday i gave up after 2-3 submits
 Nerchio: kk i will keep spamming submits then
 ZarthaxX: u are gonna get a captcha
 Nerchio: just need to get lucky in 60% of the games
 tobk: Nerchio Hm, your bots beats mine pretty consistently, 5 out of 5. But I'm still 8 ranks ahead&#160;:-P
 [CG]Thibaud: :fear:
 YannT: kovi: I'm pretty sure you're a big factor in wether the servers are doing well :p
 Nerchio: tobk i am top15 gold but i keep spamming submits
 Nerchio: hoping one will get through
 kovi: yannt, seriously it was the other way around&#160;:)
 tobk: oh, you did just resubmit. didn't see that in the opponent selection
 Nerchio: yeah
 tobk: good luck then. off to more work for now.
 Nerchio: i won 35 out of 38 last matches
 Nerchio: idk this game you can work on your bot a lot but in the end some luck is required
 Nerchio: top3 guys are really close to the boss
 Nerchio: i will push someone at some point for sure xD
 Boulet: Nerchio: u see you can win against me :D
 Nerchio: 1 game sick.
 Nerchio: idk breaking through without having 70% win ratio against top guys seems  really tough
 blasterpoard: I wonder why top gold meta is much more silence-heavy than legend meta
 NormantasStankevicius: uhmmm, what is a quick formula to calculate sector from my cordinates?
 MadKnight:  /3&#160;?
 blasterpoard: int sector() const {
 NormantasStankevicius: thanks
 NormantasStankevicius: I was having issues for some reason
 blasterpoard: make sure to use integer division
 NormantasStankevicius: I was
 NormantasStankevicius: I had a very similar formula
 NormantasStankevicius: maybe the same
 Nerchio: i hate that i am losing to lechuck in submits and  have more than 50% in practice games ;p
 NormantasStankevicius: but idk
 NormantasStankevicius: I had issues
 MadKnight: how many practice games did u play Nerchio&#160;?
 blasterpoard: if less than 1000, it's not a good sample size
 MadKnight: especially if just 5
 Nerchio: ofc not 5 xd
 MadKnight: how many&#160;?
 Nerchio: 6
 MadKnight: ez
 MadKnight: u need 7
 Nerchio: the games at the top go way too slow need to submit :D
 kovi: results are different with everyone resubmit
 Riyuk: definitely, changes the league's result everytime
 IsraelGever: any1 knows how to resize the Console output window? im getting crazy
 gaha: in CG ide? you can only Expand it
 gaha: afaik
 NormantasStankevicius: 2.2score diff between Silver boss and 2nd place
 NormantasStankevicius: yikes
 Nerchio: i will have nightmares about lechuck
 blasterpoard: he's just protecting you from the hell that is legend
 Nerchio: i would be glad with my bot rotting in legend
 Illedan: Yeah, I would like to go back down
 AntiSquid: at least you won't end up under a ventilator
 idkhow2codee: hi, if I use torpedo command after move than can I target cells in range 5 from init pos in the same direction&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: wait
 AntiSquid: you worded it weird
 idkhow2codee: xd
 AntiSquid: range 4 from wherever you are at the moment you fire
 AntiSquid: simple as that
 Nerchio: if you silence and move you can hit a target 10sqm away for 1hp
 YannT: has siman gone into hiding? :D
 idkhow2codee: I mean if I move E and fire in the same turn then can I fire my_pos _x + 5&#160;?
 AntiSquid: oh right last weekend, there should be more bots coming out of hiding
 eulerscheZahl: nah, only on monday
 Scarfield: actually 11 squares away, since the blast goes both up/down and sides
 idkhow2codee: oh nvm so I can move only after torpedo
 AntiSquid: what
 Scarfield: actions can be done in every order you want to
 idkhow2codee: oh k maybe smth wrong with code xd
 AntiSquid: fix it
 idkhow2codee: I will thanks
 JanisSerzants: if you try to shoot above the island, you get kill instantly?
 Scarfield: yes, you can only target water cells
 JanisSerzants: i mean you target water, but between me and my target (water) has island
 gaha: read the instructions about how torpedo distance is calculated
 gaha: it's actually "traveling-like" distance
 gaha: anyway, out of range torpedo does not kill you
 JanisSerzants: imagine i'm on 1 1, i want to shoow to 1 3, but 1 2 is island, will this be game over?
 gaha: No
 gaha: As I said
 gaha: You will even hit the target, since the distance is 4
 idkhow2codee: so there is some path finding algorithm involved in using torpedo
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: bfs depth 4 is enough for that
 idkhow2codee: but what what if I would be in  closed group of cells e.g 1x3 I've been once in such board 
 idkhow2codee: but that's very rare
 idkhow2codee: and if ur bot sucks like mine
 Scarfield: have you read about floodfill? its an algorithm for that kind of thing
 Scarfield: the bucket tool in Paint uses it for instance
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: great example scarfo
 cohr: codeforces &gt;&gt; 
 eulerscheZahl: codejam
 eulerscheZahl: in 3 days
 cohr: kick start in 2 days
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 Scarfield: noo, the qualification is already over&#160;:'(
 ZarthaxX: lol
 NormantasStankevicius: hmmmm, how to spam silence less?
 ZarthaxX: spam it only when in danger of getting hit?
 NormantasStankevicius: well
 NormantasStankevicius: I run the same predictions for myself
 NormantasStankevicius: as enemy
 ZarthaxX: and?
 struct: grats on legend ZarthaxX
 NormantasStankevicius: I tried using silence
 NormantasStankevicius: when my predictions reach a certain point
 NormantasStankevicius: like 30predictions where I could be
 NormantasStankevicius: I guess I'll need to do a lot more code
 ZarthaxX: thanks struct/tob
 ZarthaxX: tobo
 Nerchio: damn gold is so funny
 ZarthaxX: zenoscave pushed me hard
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Nerchio: people ending in top10 then in top 50
 ZarthaxX: its not funny at all
 Nerchio: right now i see borisZ who was at the top very often then i saw him at top40 now submitting top 5
 ZarthaxX: lol
 YannT: I swear one day I'mma look at cg and kovi will not be currently pushing and I'll get worried about him
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 blasterpoard: I have trouble deciding which version is best because the rating depends mostly on whether kovi is submitting or not
 JFB: Maybe he has bot for pushing&#160;:-)
 YannT: for the last week your ranking has pretty much been your winrate vs. kovi :p
 eulerscheZahl: is that how i got back to top20 now?
 blasterpoard: 26%	9 / 25 / 0
 blasterpoard: without kovi, I'm in top5
 YannT: 41 / 51 / 1
 YannT: it's going down though because he put me at my 500 matches limit
 YannT: in reality I probably player him &gt;200 times
 kovi: my rank depends on everyone else pushing (except jolindien who still owns me hard)
 YannT: I don't even know how you can possibly estimate how good anything is by chain pushing like this
 YannT: you realize the 150 matches of a push is not a good indicator right? :p
 eulerscheZahl: oh, a new multiplayer game. when did that happen?
 kovi: yannt, that is why i push so many, avg. of 3&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and submit spamming affects the ranking of others. and thus your rank on the next submit, as it depends on the score of other players
 YannT: why don't you use cgbench with fixed agentIds that would be a more valuable indicator :p
 JFB: Maybe kovi do not look on the rank - but calculate winrate with other playsers - each one separatelly
 YannT: a run of 150 matches, on this game, has a 10-20% variance with fixed agentIds, on ladder with other people pushing etc probably more
 YannT: actually if I get a 10-20% variance on a run with fixed top5 agentIds on cgbench, it's probably worse on ladder
 YannT: basically doesn't tell you anything
 eulerscheZahl: but playing 150 games by submit is faster than with CG-benchmark
 AntiSquid: another multi wow
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, with huge branching
 AntiSquid: someone make a plants vs zombies multi while we are at it
 eulerscheZahl: no idea how we shall keep track and play all of them
 eulerscheZahl: 6 multis on my TODO now (counting coders of the realm as 1)
 YannT: it's faster but (at least on this game) not extremelmy relevant
 YannT: "letting it sit" is a better metric by far
 YannT: unless kovi's having day, because then that too is not very precise :p
 dbdr: we need to create an alternative leaderboard
 dbdr: that's insensitive to submit spam&#160;:)
 dbdr: and to match order
 dbdr: I think someone even did that for a past contest
 dbdr: when the result of the rerun was debatable
 YannT: you could basically do the entire run with random people in the league, and only at the end of all matches update everyone's scores accordingly
 YannT: but it would be less gamey&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: bad mode with a less rock paper scissors game
 eulerscheZahl: i remember each vs each at RAIC, a lot of matches in codeball were useless because you could tell the winner before
 dbdr: you could take the matches that CG decided to run, and find the ranking that best predicts the results taken together, regardless of order
 reCurse: The leaderboard is too unstable for that to work
 reCurse: Too many submissions per player, which one is relevant
 dbdr: you do that for the last submission
 dbdr: each submission has its own value
 dbdr: since it's different code
 reCurse: The value is always relative
 dbdr: sure
 reCurse: If tons of people are submitting all the time, you lose any hope at good references
 kovi: yes
 AntiSquid: imagine a multi where you basically need to optimize a leaderboard :o
 dbdr: and imagine the leaderboard of that multi
 reCurse: The only "real" solution is continuous games and we know that won't happen
 AntiSquid: 2k frustrated players?
 dbdr: reCurse: that does not fix everything if match order matters
 reCurse: It does not fix everything but takes you much closer to reality
 AntiSquid: indeed
 reCurse: You control the entire scheduling
 reCurse: Instead of users whim
 dbdr: not more matches for new submits?
 YannT: new submits could start at current score
 reCurse: No, you need to maintain enough weight between close players that don't submit
 vlad_rdv: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c6ee4395-9bd5-4501-9069-4c1691f501b3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c6ee4395-9bd5-4501-9069-4c1691f501b3</a>
 reCurse: You could think of an optimization where you remember and reuse the winrate past X matchups for old submissions
 reCurse: But if you don't maintain relations between everyone close the leaderboard becomes fucked up
 reCurse: Like every leaderboard at CG
 reCurse: Exhibit A: Top 4 at CSB
 reCurse: Resetting sigma and not mu would also do wonders to get more juice out of submits
 reCurse: But anyway wasting time on stuff that's never happening
 dbdr: you can implement it yourself&#160;;)
 reCurse: Sure, give me access to their repo
 dbdr: you can schedule your own matches
 dbdr: no need to
 dbdr: you have the agentIds
 reCurse: Then I'll need 20 alt accounts to have decent speed
 dbdr: ah, true
 reCurse: Hope CG doesn't kill me
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: crowdsource it
 reCurse: Like I'd trust anyone here
 dbdr: no need to trust
 reCurse: To not mess with the results :p
 dbdr: they send the gameIds
 reCurse: Ah, clever
 reCurse: brb
 dbdr: you need to tell them the seed too
 AntiSquid: guess who's back
 eulerscheZahl: i can run the same game multiple times until i'm happy with the result
 dbdr: hence the seed, but true it's not enough with stochstic bots
 Nerchio: whats the oldest multi you can still play?
 dbdr: when if you need to respond withing 30 seconds
 dbdr: cannot run it more than once
 dbdr: you could not respond if you don't like the result
 AntiSquid: Nerchio Tron
 dbdr: but then the master could decide you are not reliable and stop using you
 AntiSquid: Nerchio you can see old contest games here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 Nerchio: can't play them?
 AntiSquid: you can
 AntiSquid: they are in the multi section now
 icecream17: I've discovered something weird...
 icecream17: on turn 14 the space '14 14' disappears
 icecream17: always on turn 14
 eulerscheZahl: can you elaborate on that?
 wlesavo: number magic
 icecream17: the bottom right corner disappears in turn "14" (frame 31 or so) every time
 eulerscheZahl: display bug?
 icecream17: In an array called "available"
 icecream17: No, my code
 eulerscheZahl: bot bug
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: make it happen at specific time of the day too
 Marcose: Has anyone used tornadofx with kotlin?
 Nerchio: let's goooooo
 Nerchio: making chaos in gold again
 AntiSquid: vandalize the boss Nerchio
 Nerchio: bot PLS
 Nerchio: U CAN DO IT
 Nerchio: just some luck vs lechuck
 AntiSquid: you getting rekt by the boss though
 AntiSquid: maybe you should just leave the bot on #2 after this
 Nerchio: i cursed myself
 Nerchio: again
 ZarthaxX: swag promoted
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: but he's feeding the boss
 Nerchio: comeback?.
 Nerchio: nope
 AntiSquid: yobo has most fitting avatar for #2
 Nerchio: xd
 Nerchio: 1 point is quite a lot
 Nerchio: do i keep submitting
 AntiSquid: no
 ZarthaxX: 1 point?
 AntiSquid: boss beats yu up too often
 ZarthaxX: i was like 3 below yesterday
 ZarthaxX: and i got pushed
 ZarthaxX: lol
 AntiSquid: you only roll for lower rank
 AntiSquid: ya just do a ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: what squid is kind of tru tho if u feed boss
 ZarthaxX: its never ending
 AntiSquid: hibernate until legend
 ZarthaxX: and top ppl will hate u
 ZarthaxX: ye just do that
 Nerchio: i feel like they should do
 Nerchio: eventual auto-game vs boss for top10 people
 Nerchio: or something
 Nerchio: like once in a while 1 game vs boss
 Nerchio: instead you need to wait for people submitting
 ZarthaxX: the spam is big anyway
 ZarthaxX: u gotta see last day submits
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ya and the server lag
 Nerchio: 4 wins in a row vs submitting tomatoes
 Nerchio: feels good
 Nerchio: ok i guess i will leave my bot be for now, might resubmit later if needed
 Zenoscave: zarthaxx...
 Zenoscave: you dirty toe-eyed cabbage.
 AntiSquid: make passata out of him Nerchio
 Astrobytes: pml, insult of the year Zeno
 Zenoscave: pml?
 Astrobytes: pissing myself laughing
 Zenoscave: ah
 AntiSquid: piss my life 
 Zenoscave: he beat me to legend
 Zenoscave:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw lol
 Zenoscave: I'm missing something
 AntiSquid: while doing nothing Zenoscave
 Scarfield: you got him with a head pew
 AntiSquid: he wasn't doing anything&#160;!
 Zenoscave: Will a legend player show me a match that would be a good hint
 Nerchio: you can watch legend games
 ZarthaxX: mhm
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave
 ZarthaxX: thanks
 AntiSquid: the god damn clapping gets irritating
 Zenoscave: There's so many. Just wondering if there's a good strat im missing
 ZarthaxX: wat
 ZarthaxX: hi Zenoscave
 ZarthaxX: im so sorry
 ZarthaxX: :C
 Zenoscave: hi Zenoscave
 ZarthaxX: lol
 idkhow2codee: can I silence through islands?
 Zenoscave: I am Z&lt;tab&gt;
 Nerchio: no
 struct: no
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: still love me right?
 Zenoscave: yeah 
 ZarthaxX: literally beated u almost every game ,lucky push
 ZarthaxX: oh well
 AntiSquid: well rekt
 cegprakash: anyone want to team up with me?
 cegprakash: spring challenge
 cegprakash: C++
 struct: Is it even allowed?
 cegprakash: it's not a team event?
 cegprakash: I read somewhere it's team event
 AntiSquid: even if you were the best player in the world i still wouldn't want to team up with you ceg, nothing personal though
 Nerchio: wow thats rude&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds very personal
 AntiSquid: no, assertive
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave 09:01PMI am Z&lt;tab&gt;
 Scarfield: "But i said no offense"
 Zenoscave: It depends on when you enter chat euler
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 ZarthaxX: lol AntiSquid savage
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, ban!
 AntiSquid: was a polite no
 struct: polite?
 AntiSquid: wordy&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you love ceg as much as i love a now inactive user
 struct: :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: i forgot his name
 ZarthaxX: indian boi
 struct: aniruhp?
 ZarthaxX: that one
 struct: or something like that
 AntiSquid: cybercamlemonade?
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 cegprakash: is someone trolling an Indian?
 cegprakash: I'm here for the rescue
 AntiSquid: no, because he might just be a migrant 
 Astrobytes: cegprakash where have you been? 
 cegprakash: my email says "For the Spring Challenge, we have assigned you by default to your company, else to your school. If you don't have any team yet, you can still join one. Here's mine:"
 cegprakash: so I thought it's a team event
 struct: Thats spring challenge
 struct: not OOC
 eulerscheZahl: "I agree that it’s difficult to reach the top rankings of the solo leaderboard, but in a team, there’s everything to play for. "
 AntiSquid: check the leaderboard for the current contest cegprakash
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for reminding my that my colleagues don't want to play, Thibaud
 AntiSquid: doing more "work" outside work
 ZarthaxX: same with uni friendos

 FrankR: eulerscheZahl: we wouldn't mind you on our team.. and we're hiring&#160;:)
 cegprakash: oh only 37 universities took part in OOC
 cegprakash: is it possible for a 1 man team?
 eulerscheZahl: in Ulm, um Ulm und um Ulm herum
 struct: no euler I mean for Spring challenge
 cegprakash: I'll submit a dummy bot in OOC
 FrankR: München oder Meersburg ginge auch&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: what are you working on? projects? technology stack?
 FrankR: consultancy.. so it depends on the client projects a lot
 eulerscheZahl: found your website
 FrankR: oh gosh.. we haven't hidden it enough.. I'll let our marketing know, thanks
 struct: 2.3 points diff
 cegprakash: if I start OOC today how far can I go
 struct: rank 1
 eulerscheZahl: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: you are your own limit
 ZarthaxX: rank1 wood
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 FrankR: eulerscheZahl: also tech stacks vary widely.. from bare metal embedded C projects all the way up to the cloud
 Astrobytes: Why did you not start already ceg, that's why I asked where have you been?
 AntiSquid: away from the pain and suffering, Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: he was hiding coz contest too hurd
 Astrobytes: lol, no ceg, and no Madeleine either
 AntiSquid: madao would have played if the subs had velocity, not his fault
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Nerchio: 0.43 pts behind boss xd
 struct: Nerchio just wait
 struct: someone will push you
 Astrobytes: ^^
 Nerchio: no i will submit now!
 ZarthaxX: no u wont lmao
 AntiSquid: bad idea Nerchio, better wait for 0.01 diff
 Astrobytes: For your sake I hope that was a joke Nerchio :D
 Nerchio: its all zenos fault btw
 Nerchio: he beat me 8 times in that submit
 Neumann: Nerchio, are you the famous SC2 player&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: once i resubmitted with 0.01 below the gold boss, took me days to promote
 Nerchio: Neumann i might have played some sc2 ;d

 ZarthaxX: lol

 Neumann: Irrelevant
 ZarthaxX: weird answer
 struct: go 1vs1 starcraft
 eulerscheZahl: wikipedia tells me that Nerchio has a twitch account. do you want him to stream CG as a proof?
 ZarthaxX: tomatoes promoting him?
 tomatoes: a bit
 Nerchio: i am 1-1 in his submit
 AntiSquid: struct, on blizz game chat it would be&#160;: "1on1 noob?" 
 struct: sorry  havent played
 Astrobytes: *1v1 noob
 AntiSquid: any argument ends up with someone asking that

 Nerchio: well just gotta wait
 AntiSquid: well fed
 Nerchio: trictrac smashing into top5
 Nerchio: took my points
 AntiSquid: a true friend gives points
 AntiSquid: thanks for the points
 Nerchio: time to resubmit
 tobk: how often did you submit so far, in total?
 Nerchio: i have 250 submits over a week or something
 Nerchio: 215 submits
 Zenoscave: 1,273...
 struct: wtf
 tomatoes: 112
 tobk: 39&#160;:-D
 Nerchio: zenos i see you coming with a submit at 30% and then u stop :D
 Zenoscave: I lose too many low rank to pass
 Nerchio: i had same
 Nerchio: but last few submits were pretty consistent in getting to top15 at least
 tobk: including 2 to test only silence 0-1 and only silence 0, did not really make a difference in rank for me
 AntiSquid: top 50 isn't low rank you snob
 Nerchio: xD
 Zenoscave: but top 200 is
 Zenoscave: ...
 Nerchio: but yea good start in a submit bumps you quickly to the top
 Zenoscave: I'm not discrediting anyone's code. I just know I can't pass legend if I fail too many beginning matches
 SaadEdynn: khoti rah w7lna wlah ma3rfna ki ndiro liha

 KobeL: Sure thing! Will do from now on
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ah clash
 AntiSquid: or something like:WARNING: it's clash of code
 KobeL: Currently doing some clashed indeed, might work on my stream setup or some puzzles later
 Astrobytes: KobeL, remember to post what you are streaming (clash,puzzles, contest) in the discord channel or you'll lose viewers
 KobeL: Edited
 Nerchio: zenos bombing top10 over and over again :D
 Zenoscave: Yeah&#160;:/
 Nerchio: its what i did for most of the day before
 Nerchio: will do it tomorrow as well if i fall down
 Zenoscave: really dense top 10
 Nerchio: im afraid its only going to get worse as time goes by
 NormantasStankevicius: ^ same
 AntiSquid: it usually does Nerchio
 Amrhossam: does this help really getting a job&#160;?
 Illedan: To some degree
 Amrhossam: but it's all about algorithms
 Amrhossam: companies care about building stuff not memorizing algorithms
 Illedan: Hence to some degree
 Amrhossam: i'm a mechanical engineer after all
 NormantasStankevicius: Employers enjoy enthusiasm 
 NormantasStankevicius: If you participate in these kind of events, codejams work on your own on some passion stuff
 NormantasStankevicius: it will sho
 NormantasStankevicius: w
 NormantasStankevicius: to employers that you are passionate about what you are doing, and hence it means you might work better
 NormantasStankevicius: because you might look like a hard worker with a desire, not a worker who is living for a living
 Nerchio: zenos are u feeding the boss
 Zenoscave: 2/3 losses
 Zenoscave: only 1 win
 Nerchio: my bot loses to you 65% of the games i think
 Nerchio: go legend so i can rest in peace
 Zenoscave: I'm trying
 Illedan: Very close now zeno
 Zenoscave: this is my best bot so far for sure
 Zenoscave: But i feed boss too much
 Nerchio: you won 7 games in a row vs me :P
 Zenoscave: 72 wins 25 losses 4 ties
 AntiSquid: lies, he wants to be the gatekeeper to legend
 Nerchio: bot 30.5&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: I had 1/5 against boss....
 Zenoscave: err 1/6
 Nerchio: you are second so i guess camp time? :P
 Zenoscave: not until I figure out why i lose terribly to boss
 wlesavo: because it is so good? :slight_smile:
 Zenoscave: true
 AntiSquid: what's the secret to your shenanigans wlesavo?
 Astrobytes: They'd no longer be shenanigans if he told ye squiddy
 MSmits: hi guys
 Astrobytes: Oh hey man, you good?
 MSmits: been away for a bit, busy with work on uttt. But now I am back to try and get a respectable rank before end of contest. Hopefully legend (?)
 darkhorse64: no sleep til legend&#160;?
 MSmits: work and uttt i was gonna say
 Astrobytes: How did UTTT go?
 darkhorse64: play onitama. I am waiting for you. Or push me to legen
 MSmits: rank 1 again
 darkhorse64: d
 Astrobytes: gg
 MSmits: darkhorse64 will do onitama between the two contests
 MSmits: but i'm taking it easy
 wlesavo: MSmits nice
 Illedan: Welcome back
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: i coded some mine avoidance today
 cegprakash: in OOC is Silence = Jump?
 cegprakash: I'm on wood1
 MSmits: it's working, but it's no miracle cure
 Illedan: This game sure as hell has no silver bullet
 Illedan: Who makes stuff like this&#160;:(
 MSmits: it really doesn't. I'm guessing it's lots of little tweaks and such
 icecream17: silence = move N * 4
 Astrobytes: cegprakash it's moving between 0 - 4 cells without telling your opponent where you moved
 MSmits: I kinda thought it was gonna be like that. I do like the game, but I don't like to spend 4 weeks on trial and error
 Illedan: Yeah, I did chill some during it
 Illedan: Regretting now
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Too much I wanna do
 Illedan: and then work I need to do too
 wlesavo: AntiSquid in fact only the stuff that i considered necessary, in a sence that i thought everybody would do that at some point, but i guess there are couple of shenanigans as well
 MSmits: I think i coded 5 days total or something
 Astrobytes: At least it goes straight to multi after
 MSmits: It's hard to not get drawn away by these majestic board games&#160;:)
 Illedan: New one today
 MSmits: even uttt 
 MSmits: which?
 Illedan: New multi
 Astrobytes: Daisies and something
 MSmits: sounds very masculine
 MSmits: tulips and daisies
 Astrobytes: Tulips and Daisies
 Illedan: Pure bitboard optimization fun :P
 MSmits: yet, you did it in C# 
 Astrobytes: Hey, "Tulips From Amsterdam" MSmits :P
 MSmits: yeah i was gonna say, I'm dutch, automatic tulip expert
 Illedan: Maybe I should try C++ :O
 Zenoscave: I might rewrite  my bot in C++ after contest
 MSmits: I dont see you use that... have you coded c++ before?
 Illedan: Nope :D
 Illedan: Might as well try it some day
 Zenoscave: It's a very different beast from C#
 Astrobytes: I hope the momentum will keep going after contest
 Illedan: or learn to code with unsafe :thinking:
 MSmits: you'll learn it faster than I did. Just pick a multi for which you coded a small bot with not too much of the Linq magic and such and convert that to c++
 MSmits: I recommend uttt or similar
 MSmits: or do rust or something, be original
 Zenoscave: I might try and make a LINQ++ header library
 MSmits: I might have done a different language if i had to choose now
 Zenoscave: SFINAE style and all
 MSmits: c++ is nuts sometimes. Earlier I accidentally mistlaid a parentheses and it just compiled and ran... just not very well. It was like Setpath(x,y), z;   instead of Setpath(x,y,z);  c++ is nuts
 Zenoscave: Ah yes compound statements
 Zenoscave: those are the worst
 MSmits: the annoying thing is that the Setpath function was overloaded
 MSmits: so both ways were ok and apparently the ,z didn't bother it
 Zenoscave: Oh man that is pretty unlucky
 MSmits: yeah
 Scarfield: shouldnt it fail because you call it with too many arguments?
 MSmits: no it was overloaded
 MSmits: both were ok
 MSmits: I was calling the one with 2 arguments, but i meant to call the one with 3
 MSmits: and all i did was misplace a parentheses
 Scarfield: aah&#160;:/
 MSmits: in any sane language that would give a syntax error and it costs you like 2 seconds
 MSmits: The only thing i like about c++ is the speed. 
 MSmits: That's why I would maybe like to learn a different, more modern fast language
 Scarfield: D++ will soon be available :p
 Astrobytes: You could check for things like that but it would be more coding
 MSmits: yeah I am sure a more competent coder would not spend too much time fixing my mistakes
 Nerchio: i feel like all coders say that
 Zenoscave: especially the really competent ones
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: MSmits you're what rank in uttt?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: 1
 Astrobytes: and +1
 MSmits: that's more raw talent and obsession :P
 cegprakash: Astrobytes if I do Move N TORPEDO from 5,5 and I use silence where do I go?
 Zenoscave: Ceg read the instructions
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: cegprakash it depends
 cegprakash: oh I can specify that as well
 cegprakash: sick
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave classic ceg :D
 Zenoscave: exactly
 Scarfield: you still refuse to read the statements i see :D
 Illedan: The contest is not to reverse engineer the rules -.-
 Astrobytes: No contest is the same without ceg appearing and demanding to know the rules before reading the statement :D
 cegprakash: Illedan I joined the party late.. but I did join
 MSmits: I read the statement very well and I still somehow understood it to say that Surface teleports you across the map
 Astrobytes: Welcome at last cegprakash!
 Astrobytes: LOL forgot about your Tardis submarines MSmits
 MSmits: I coded 600+ lines before I figured out it didn't teleport. I watch too few games
 AntiSquid: still have a crappy mine tracker, maybe i should have focused on improving something else&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: All good, I found a bug today that I do believe I have to do a rewrite for
 MSmits: how do you track mines, if you dont mind sharing
 AntiSquid: that's like the worst bit of the contest
 MSmits: oh also, is it the tracking of the positions of the mines or the code to avoid them?
 AntiSquid: mine per path? same as everyone else?
 MSmits: but why is it crappy?
 Illedan: that is 2 different problems MSmits
 MSmits: yeah i know
 AntiSquid: doesn't get me far
 Illedan: tracking is the hard part
 MSmits: mmh, depends... i had to think less for the tracking than for the avoidance
 AntiSquid: you have a tracker too MSmits no?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: only today coded the avoidance
 MSmits: i had a tracker a week ago
 AntiSquid: ya without tracker i get about rank 40 - 50, with tracker i get stuck at 70 - 80
 MSmits: mmh but that is weird. How would mine tracking make you get a different rank
 AntiSquid: so it's crap right?
 MSmits: it's just more information
 AntiSquid: because bot reacts differently
 MSmits: are you sure it isnt the way you deal with the information thats wrong?
 MSmits: not the tracking/.
 AntiSquid: the tracking can't be 100% accurate either way
 MSmits: depends on what you consider accurate. I track positions from where mines were laid. That is accurate. You just dont know where they put them
 MSmits: left, right, up, down
 Swagboy: Same MSmits, avoidance is more tricky as you need to anticipate opponent probability of triggering
 MSmits: I dont even do that. I assume they can see me, currently
 cegprakash: do I lose a life if I use SONAR when it's on cooldown?
 Illedan: no
 MSmits: not a life
 MSmits: either it fails or you lose, not sure
 Illedan: but self tracking makes you crash
 MSmits: huh
 Swagboy: it fails, you might lose your charge
 Swagboy: But you don't lose I think, like wrong trigger/torpedo
 MSmits: anyone else get confused by the orders. I keep reading  MOVE E TORPEDO as the sub launching a torpedo
 Illedan: MSmits, when you track yourself you look at your own prints, and if it failed. You can't know. As someone didn't add that as part of the input
 cegprakash: oh I see my bot always picks my grid to use sonar
 MSmits: Illedan I'm not sure what you mean by self tracking?
 MSmits: do you mean using your own orders on your own tracking mechanism you also use for the oppponent?
 tomatoes: yes. to know how much opponent knows
 Scarfield: you know what you are going to output, so also what opponent will know
 MSmits: ok makes sense, but why does Illedan says this makes you crash and what is lacking in the input?
 Zenoscave: opponent view tracking is important. It makes you crash if you don't bound the possible size. timeouts
 MSmits: ah... well isn't this just effectively doubling your calc time?
 Illedan: If you track yourself and assume you do invalid commands, you are suddenly out of possible locations
 Scarfield: incorrect output is not given as input, only performed actions comes as input
 MSmits: ahhhh Illedan I get it now
 MSmits: so don't do invalid commands :P
 Zenoscave: I forgot about that
 Illedan: Yeah, as past tense Illedan forgot about adding it as inputs&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Well, it is what it is
 MSmits: I don't see the problem. If someone is that far into his bot that he makes a self tracker, why would he still be doing invalid commands?
 Scarfield: that would just make people output stuff to mess with other bots i suppose
 Illedan: There is this thing called bugs, you might have heard of it? :P
 MSmits: yes, but that's their bugs, not yours :P
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450980498">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450980498</a>
 cegprakash: what's happening
 cegprakash: I don't understand
 cegprakash: why I don't get any sonar
 Astrobytes: You lost ceg
 Zenoscave: 5 Codinbucks says Ceg didn't read the rules
 Scarfield: xD
 icecream17: MOVE N SONAR
 Illedan: You tried to torpedo something you could NOT
 tomatoes: charge it first
 Zenoscave: You ran out of lives
 wlesavo: lol
 Scarfield: MOAR SURFACE
 wlesavo: nice sonar btw
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't bet a single Codincent against that Zenoscave :D
 wlesavo: well at least opponent got your sector, so it kinda like sonar
 MSmits: well it works 50%
 MSmits: right i was gonna say that
 Illedan: cegprakash, I think your MinMax values having free space too much..
 MSmits: at least someone can see him&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I am printing extra endl
 cegprakash: every turn
 cegprakash: shit
 Zenoscave: XD
 MSmits: :poop:
 Zenoscave: I hate when that happens
 Astrobytes: Why does the jobby emoji look surprised? 
 Illedan: jobby?
 Astrobytes: Woops, showing my Scottishness, the poop
 MSmits: think he means mr turd
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450981973">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450981973</a>
 cegprakash: there is something wrong with sonar cooldown
 cegprakash: I never get sonar cooldown
 cegprakash: the charge is always 0
 MSmits: you need to charge it...
 MSmits: MOVE E SONAR
 Zenoscave: on MOVE the last word is what you choose to charge
 MSmits: moves you east and charges sonar
 Scarfield: or read the statement, it would go faster, than stumbling on problems and asking chat&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: MOVE W READ_STATEMENT
 cegprakash: I used to print MOVE E TORPEDO
 cegprakash: instead of TORPEDO i now print SONAR?
 MSmits: yes
 Zenoscave: If you want to charge sonar yes
 Zenoscave: resource allocation
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes has the best one 
 cegprakash: I can't charge both?
 Illedan: Someone actually used time to write the statement -.-
 AntiSquid: i can't make my own rules?
 Illedan: Sure
 cegprakash: "charges a power of your choice. When you move, you must respect the following rules:"
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: I'll respect
 Astrobytes: cegprakash honestly mate you'd save a fuckload of time just by reading
 icecream17: you can charge both.... just takes a few more turns....
 Illedan: shh, let him read
 MSmits: mostly our time though :P
 cegprakash: oh no now what do I charge
 Astrobytes: MSmits not wrong man :D
 cegprakash: to get out off wood
 AntiSquid: if you charge torpedo and silence you get super combo charge bonus and have a free trigger charge
 Astrobytes: You're mobile ceg
 Illedan: torpedo &gt; silence &gt; sonar
 MSmits: our time would be better spent discussing the surprisedness of mr turd
 Astrobytes: *Your
 Astrobytes: I agree MSmits * Mr Jobby
 Zenoscave: Jobby the hut
 Astrobytes: t
 Turch: Hey, I beat Boss 3 in Wood 1 League for Coders Strike Back, but I'm not advancing to the next league - am I missing something?
 Astrobytes: And yeah, I like that
 MSmits: Dr Dung
 Zenoscave: There's a time wait Turch
 Astrobytes: The wee beige jobby<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7idfce">https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7idfce</a>
 Turch: Ah okay, good to know, thanks.
 Zenoscave: I probably shouldn't open that link should I Astro
 Astrobytes: Billy Connolly, good Scottish standup comedian Zeno
 Zenoscave: Ok Will look
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN this better be an improvement T_T
 AutomatonNN: can i just translate a strategy to create a contest to the contest so i can see the game for the con
 AntiSquid: test
 Scarfield: icles
 AntiSquid: contesticles? :thinking
 Turch: Am I wasting my time by trying to determine an absolute angle of my racer in Coders Strike Back?
 Turch: This isn't something that I just get later on with an  'angle' parameter, right?
 Scarfield: yes, you will get it later
 Turch: Alright, maybe I should just wait. Here I was saving the last three x's and y's so I could determine my rough angle with arctan, lol.
 Astrobytes: Did you watch it Zenoscave?
 AntiSquid: watch it Zenoscave, Astrobytes will ask you questions later to make sure you watched it
 Astrobytes: lol no  Iwon't
 Astrobytes: *I won't
 Zenoscave: No i'm focusing on bot tuning
 Zenoscave: Send it to me in PM and I'll look later
 Astrobytes: Meh, fuck that, just google Scottish comedians and jobby
 Zenoscave: ok&#160;:+1:
 Nerchio: so many times i've fallen for
 Nerchio: that north is lower y than south
 Zenoscave: Are you doing that now?
 Nerchio: no just every time i touch code for north/south i need to think about it
 Nerchio: and many times i make a mistake
 Zenoscave: I feel. thats why I abstract it into deltas and never use directions in client code
 Zenoscave: So anytime i look at directions i do foreach (offset in Direrctions) { ... }
 Nerchio: i changed my strategy a little bit now need some lucky commit to see if it works
 Nerchio: in this submit i lost to a guy who shoots  a random rocket on round 3 in an open map
 Nerchio: ^.-
 Zenoscave: good luck Nerchio!
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave so close :D
 AntiSquid: like many others before
 Zenoscave: I can feel it this time...
 Turch: So what's the general strategy for dealing with collision in Coders Strike Back?
 AntiSquid: press back button and go play something else
 Turch: lmao
 Turch: Good point, I guess
 AntiSquid: and if you don't believe me just look at the numbers
 Nerchio: lol
 AntiSquid: there's no way 90k people are still playing it
 Turch: I really feel like the circumstances are bound too much by randomness to 'solve' it
 AntiSquid: Turch no strategy, just math
 AntiSquid: check distance between their middle point
 Nerchio: zenos im coming to push you
 Nerchio: maybe :p
 AntiSquid: and compare to sum of radius
 AntiSquid: done
 Zenoscave: let's hope!
 Turch: Short of programming your racer to take circles around the points.
 AntiSquid: you need to to take much into consideration the shap
 AntiSquid: shape
 AntiSquid: just the distance between points
 AntiSquid: but seriously, i rather play this contest than CSB
 Turch: Yeah I'm measuring my dist to theirs.
 Turch: Just not sure if I should be avoiding or ramming them
 Turch: And often it depends on the circumstances of whom gets a headstart
 AntiSquid: so if the sum of radius is too close to distance value then it's a collision
 Turch: Right.
 Nerchio: maybe i should turn off my silence 4 kills me a little too much
 AntiSquid: usually anywy
 Zenoscave: silence 4?
 Nerchio: yeah
 Turch: I can understand avoiding collision, but that doesn't help me win
 Turch: lol
 Turch: I can avoid collision the whole way, but that doesn't mean much if I can't get ahead
 Nerchio: hulk smash
 Zenoscave: on boss??
 Nerchio: on everyone around top10
 Zenoscave: Nice!
 Nerchio: but i have only 20 matches left
 Zenoscave: wait... I'm around top 10
 AntiSquid: you sometimes need to collide Turch watch replays
 Nerchio: i am 0-4 vs jbl this submit
 AntiSquid: if opponent is ahead and there is a sharp turn you don't slow down as much as you should and try to collide with him so you bounce off and move towards next checkpoint
 Nerchio: woops
 Zenoscave: no...
 Zenoscave: oops
 Turch: Believe me, AntiSquid. I have a tackle function. 
 Zenoscave: Now beat the boss!!!!
 Turch: I think I just can't get ahead to start, because I usually make up my distance on the goodness of my turns
 Nerchio: i swear hitting submit is like gambling
 Nerchio: so addicting lol
 Zenoscave: It really is
 Turch: I also have my boost set to boost at third time I encounter a distance greater than ones I've encountered before - that way I aim for the best case scenario
 Zenoscave: THANK YOU 
 Nerchio: you got in?
 Zenoscave: Still calculating
 Nerchio: i beat boss once and lost twice to you xD
 Zenoscave: miight be enough but it's definitely close
 Turch: Maybe I'll just move on. My brain is too small for CSB
 Zenoscave: 3rd loss!
 Nerchio: i finished submit
 AntiSquid: ok now submit again
 mlomb: looks promising zenoscave!
 Zenoscave: well hold on.
 Zenoscave: I think so!!!!!
 Nerchio: the ranking is pretty dumb
 AntiSquid: play a game of chicken:the one who is first to stop submit spamming will lose
 Zenoscave: only 0.32 below
 Nerchio: i won 70% of the matches against all the top guys
 Turch: Anyway, thanks for the help, AntiSquid
 Nerchio: and i placed top6
 AntiSquid: fair
 Nerchio: people with killshots from across the map in the middle of gold are scary
 Nerchio: xD
 Zenoscave: new submit?
 Nerchio: yea but bad start so not going far probably
 AntiSquid: lol they have fatality checks and are mid gold
 Dav1dS: this guy is streaming coding clashes and challenges <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings">https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings</a>
 Nerchio: yea there is many people in mid gold with finishers already
 Zenoscave: We know Dav1dS he has sent the link before
 AntiSquid: which is why i don't want to watch him Dav1dS
 Nerchio: im here to code a bot not watching coding clashes
 Zenoscave: submit looks good Nerchio! Any changes?
 Nerchio: no
 AntiSquid: anti zeno modifications
 Nerchio: i dont change anything anymore today
 Nerchio: just spam submit a couple of times and i go to bed
 Zenoscave: lol 
 Zenoscave: let's hope pro zeno mods
 Nerchio: maybe i can turn on some more random shooting
 Nerchio: should be good vs you
 Nerchio: xD
 Zenoscave: Random shooting?
 Nerchio: ye atm my bot is pretty passive
 Nerchio: its more consistent in mid gold
 Zenoscave: Mine is wildly random in mid/low gold
 AntiSquid: i am going, still need to work tomorrow 
 Zenoscave: gn AntiSquid!
 Nerchio: bye
 Nerchio: rip around 20 i think
 Zenoscave: yeah?
 Zenoscave: bad RNG?
 Nerchio: i guess
 Nerchio: it's hard to get through people who shoot even though there is 25 possibilities on the map where i can be
 Nerchio: and hit me for 2 ;p
 Zenoscave: yeah that is pretty tough
 ZarthaxX: that's called skill
 Nerchio: was a good submit until i run into 25 crashes
 Nerchio: funny it got to top50
 Zenoscave: timeouts why?
 Nerchio: i changed my mine code which resulted in me accessing -1 in array
 Nerchio: was a good start of the submit sad :D
 Zenoscave: well fix it&#160;;)
 Nerchio: i did
 KobeL: Streaming coding clashes still, if anyone is interested in watching or joining: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings/">https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings/</a>
 Zenoscave: Not really KobeL
 Zenoscave: CoC is not really all that popular
 KobeL: I know but there's still people that like doing it :D
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 KiwiTae: Zenoscave pewpew
 Zenoscave: pew pew
 Zenoscave: Hi kiwi
 KiwiTae: seting up my custom ue4 engine lol got some time to spare &gt;,&lt;
 KiwiTae: whats up o/
 Zenoscave: Do the contest
 KiwiTae: I am in wood :D 
 Zenoscave: nice!
 KiwiTae: was hard to get there
 KiwiTae: pressed join took me a week
 KiwiTae: hehe
 Zenoscave: It's a long contest. been going for almost 4 weeks
 icecream17: Don't know why... but somehow the first possibleOpp position is almost always the actual position by turn 50
 KiwiTae: yeaa just saw it was still on
 KiwiTae: awesome way to spend lockdown i guess
 Zenoscave: Yeah it's been a great time spender
 Nerchio: zenos pushed maybe? xD
 Zenoscave: YUP!!!!!!!!
 Zenoscave: was above boss by less than 0.01
 Nerchio: gz :p
 Zenoscave: thanks!
 Nerchio: should be easier without you xD
 vbplaya: Why does the "Top 100 schools" only show 37?
 ZarthaxX: ZENOOOOOOOOOOO
 ZarthaxX: GZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
 ZarthaxX: go sleep now
 MadKnight: hey hey ZarthaxX
 MadKnight: vbplaya maybe there are only 37&#160;?
 MadKnight: Zenoscave still there&#160;?
 Dav1dS: can anyone give me a hint on coders strike back bronze rank level 4 (aka boss 4)
 KiwiTae: Dav1dS whats your strategy so far?
 KiwiTae: MadKnight o/ hey

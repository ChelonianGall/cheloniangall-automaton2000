 Mchamburger: anyone use this platform to have coding interview?
 MadKnight: yea there were some people
 Raidorx: y this fucking hard
 Tarkro: so... I got a clash of clan.. reverse mode.. no idea what was going on tbh
 Tarkro: input= 101
 Tarkro: output = 10201
 impatmcb: n**2
 Tarkro: input = 1111output = 1234321
 impatmcb: n*n
 impatmcb: or n**2
 Tarkro: input = 22output = 484
 Tarkro: those are the ones i can remeber
 impatmcb: You want me to give you the answer again?
 Tarkro: i think another one was something like this input = 264output = 696969But I'm really not sure about this one though
 impatmcb: 264 * 264 = 69696
 Raidorx: what u guys think of my title its called escape the doors
 Darkdarkbruhbruhlmao: DARK DARK BRUH BRUH LMAO
 Raidorx: ()_()
 Xotiic_312: hello
 Xotiic_312: this is hard
 Xotiic_312: but fun at the same time
 derjack: woah tryangle catch as potw
 Halo1005: hi

 OMEGALUL0: guys anyone know a coding puzzle in some gaming bar? cant remember the name
 OMEGALUL0: it had 1970-1980 vibes
 ErrorRazor: A puzzle on codingame?
 OMEGALUL0: yes
 OMEGALUL0: u get some hints and u solve problem with coding
 derjack: the escape thing?
 OMEGALUL0: no idea cant find it
 [CG]Thibaud: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/?continue=%2Fgames">https://escape.codingame.com/?continue=%2Fgames</a>
 darkhorse64: @[CG]Thibaud: Is there a way to change boss names in contributions&#160;?
 OMEGALUL0: oh yeah that one
 AntiSquid: ^ people are yearning to express their creativity
 hahahabro1: rtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrt
 anantaCodes: Does making semi correct submission for problems in Practice lead to deduction of XP in case I make a fully correct submission later on?
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm not sure darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: ofc, I have looked into the SDK documentation/samples but I found nothing.
 tarsumae: :heart_eyes:
 derjack: :thinking:
 derjack: hmm is the player is boss you could set different text in the viewer
 darkhorse64: Reading the message after the move and if "ClobberSan", tweak a few things. It will change only the viewer part. Not a satisfying solution
 Astrobytes: Hacky. And only partial.
 Astrobytes: Oh, Tryangle Catch potw
 darkhorse64: I am looking into BotG repo. There is a "bossNames.txt" file
 AntiSquid: right
 AntiSquid: i am not sure if that was for saiksy to look at and add the names manually
 Astrobytes: Also that was pre-SDK iirc
 darkhorse64: I'll do a quick test back home. 
 AntiSquid: ya it was for human reading :P
 wlesavo: hey guys, does anyone have a link for A* validators, i remember seeing it somewhere
 AntiSquid: pre-sdk was very similar to current env from what i can see Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: well that wasn't pre, more like beta version 
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 AntiSquid: mean max was pre
 darkhorse64: So boss names is a hidden feature&#160;?
 Gilqamesh: I have 10 fps on the website, does anyone know how to improve that?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/A*Craft">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/A*Craft</a>
 AntiSquid: no, it's manually added
 AntiSquid: DarkElf3
 AntiSquid: darkhorse64
 wlesavo: Astrobytes nice, thx a lot
 Astrobytes: no problem
 darkhorse64: :disappointed:
 wlesavo: been out for quite a while, looking for it job, but now im done, so back to cg :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: Wondered where you'd been, welcome back&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: oh double Hulk for wood6  :D
 AntiSquid: forgot about it
 AntiSquid: hey darkhorse64 just give it a try anyway? there is at least 1 in a million chance it will work
 Butanium: anyone here who did the platinium rift 2 code programming challenge?
 wlesavo: Astrobytes yeah, those interviews and test projects take most of my free time after raic
 AntiSquid: Butanium yes
 AntiSquid: only question i will answer though
 darkhorse64: Butanium: read the post mortems. There is a lot of information here
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: I can believe that. Found a good new job then?
 wlesavo: Astrobytes yeah, in c++ actually, didn't started yet, but im pretty excited
 Astrobytes: Ah excellent, well done!
 AntiSquid: had a job interview late last year, one of the questions was how i will feel about working from home 99% of the time and not seeing anyone face to face, no human interaction ... i said we still have online team meetings, it doesn't bother me :D
 Butanium: do you know how I can get the opponent base in this challenge?
 AntiSquid: i think they wanted to hear something else
 Astrobytes: It sounds ideal! :D
 AntiSquid: this was one of those jobs where i didn't care if i get it or not once they made the details of day-to-day work clear
 Butanium: Like is this possible to get the ID of the opponent base?
 AntiSquid: the advert was overhyped basically
 wlesavo: thx :slight_smile: i really didn't expected to get a decent job with no experience, but cg counts for smth, and i did learned a lot during interview stage
 Astrobytes: Butanium: When you read inputs on first turn
 AntiSquid: didn't you 10 year lab experience count wlesavo&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or what was it you're proficient in anyway?
 wlesavo: well it is not programming related in any way, so for most companies it didnt matter
 Astrobytes: Butanium: If your current zone owner id matches yours, it's yours. Otherwise if it's the opponent id, it's the opponent base
 Astrobytes: On the first turn.
 darkhorse64: First turn, only bases are populated
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: what do you need to do if you don't mind me asking wlesavo&#160;? either way congratulations on finding something you like
 wlesavo: AntiSquid but i ended up in a partially scientific development, so it mattered for them
 AntiSquid: AHA&#160;! .... well that's diff then :P
 Astrobytes: Certainly can't hurt anyway&#160;:)
 wlesavo: AntiSquid well it is computer vision lab, but im in computer tomography division
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 Butanium: oh wait doesn't the fog war prvent me from knowing who own the base? 
 wlesavo: and they do actually publish most of their results, so kind of scientific
 AntiSquid: close enough
 darkhorse64: The base is always visible
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Fun game.
 darkhorse64: Completely different from PR1 and more accessible
 Butanium: only the base, not every zone right?
 Astrobytes: Yes and yes.
 Butanium: ok thanks a lot ^^
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS: welcome to Clobber&#160;:)

 thanshaw: how's everyone doing today?
 creeperZnation4: Pretty good if I do say so myself
 thanshaw: Awesome, same here. It's my day off of classes, figured I'd take a break from this queue project and do some practice on here
 jacek: queue project?
 thanshaw: have a project for my data structures class, need to solve a maze using a queue implemented with a linked list. Have t find the quickest path through the maze, it's pretty fun - but my first time working with a queue
 creeperZnation4: Queues are interesting, aren't they XD
 AntiSquid: FIFO thanshaw
 thanshaw: They really are :p and yup, FIFO! I'm a little stuck on it, but I just need to put in some more time, it's not too bad
 Lachrymosa: Is the maze always exterior wall entrance and exit?
 thanshaw: you start at 0,0. It's built from a 2d array of type char - and ' ' represent spaces you can move to, and '*' represent blocked off spaces. What you do is you mark the path taken with an 'X' as well
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-cpp-stl/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-cpp-stl/</a> thanshaw
 Lachrymosa: do you know the exit coordinate?
 thanshaw: and you end at [height - 1][width - 1]
 AntiSquid: what language do you need it in lol
 thanshaw: c++, i made some good head way though already&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: click link
 thanshaw: we actually are using an implemented queue al;ready, no libraries for it, so we can really learn the concepts fromt he ground up
 AntiSquid: ...
 AntiSquid: lol
 Lachrymosa: I'm not sure how I'd solve it with a queue but I would flood fill from the exit.  Or hand on right wall method for initial sim solve and trim extraneous paths with heuristics.
 jacek: just use reverse stack [solved]
 thanshaw: it's a classic queue problem i guess
 AntiSquid: you add the neighbours of 0 0 to queue, then remove the 0 0 from queue then proceed with next element 
 thanshaw: but i'd prefer learning it this way rather than using a library, i mean in the future i'll probably only use a library for it. but this way i get hands on work with a queue, and really understand what's going on under the hood
 AntiSquid: there's not much to learn about it
 Lachrymosa: AntiSquid wouldn't that be similar to just going by nodes without a struct?
 thanshaw: well i know how a queue works, but actually using it is what i've never done before, it's why i'm in data structures haha
 AntiSquid: the queue is implemented as a list Lachrymosa
 AntiSquid: not the maze
 thanshaw: it's super interesting though, i'm having fun learning it
 AntiSquid: what do you mean you're in data structures?
 Lachrymosa: hm, im not getting it then
 jacek: his house is heap
 thanshaw: i'm in a class about data strcutures, queue's binary trees, linked lists
 thanshaw: how to implement them without libraries, and how to use them practically 
 AntiSquid: ok not much to learn then
 thanshaw: kek
 thanshaw: to each their own
 AntiSquid: less typing and you'll be done in 10 mins
 Lachrymosa: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://classes.adamaviv.com/ic312/f16/project/01/project.html">https://classes.adamaviv.com/ic312/f16/project/01/project.html</a> like this?
 thanshaw: pretty similar yeah, he gave us the que implementation already. so all we have to do is write out solve method that takes queue objects and adds them into the queue  
 AntiSquid: Lachrymosa that image explains what i said earlier lol <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://classes.adamaviv.com/ic312/f16/project/01/maze_solve.gif">https://classes.adamaviv.com/ic312/f16/project/01/maze_solve.gif</a>
 Lachrymosa: Yea, I like pictures better, it helps me
 AntiSquid: thanshaw if you didn't finish yet your project, you're overthinking it, remember this line every 5 minutes
 thanshaw: my understanding is you keep ENQUEUEing until you hit a barrier which is '*' in my case, once you hit that you DEQUEUE right? this is my first time working with a queue, so i'l still trying to grasp it
 jacek: this is what you do with graphs <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/YaPaperSoccer/blob/master/ai_readme/bfs_combined.mp4?raw=true">https://github.com/jdermont/YaPaperSoccer/blob/master/ai_readme/bfs_combined.mp4?raw=true</a>
 Scarfield: thanshaw <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html</a> has some really nice illustrations and explanations of pathfinding algorithms, that will help with understanding it&#160;:)
 thanshaw: yeah sorry, i've only been working with c++ for a little bit now, this is my first actual in depth class using it - before this we just learned a lot of the basic things like struct's, class's, dynamic allocation 
 thanshaw: thank you!&#160;:) not looking for answers or anything, figuring it out on my own is how i really grasp it - but this helps a ton!
 AntiSquid: what is the point of DEQUEUEING after you reach *&#160;? and how would you do that anyway?
 Lachrymosa: When would it be beneficial to use a queue for maze solving over say flood fill?
 AntiSquid: i kind of do most of the time Lachrymosa 
 Lachrymosa: Is it down to preference or are there benefits to one over the other?
 thanshaw: not sure, all i know is solving mazes is a classic queue problem, may not be the best but it's been used as a queue example for a very long time
 AntiSquid: queues and floodfill aren't mutually exclusive either
 jacek: doesnt floodfill use queue?
 Lachrymosa: I suppose that is true, you're just queuing from the end first?
 Lachrymosa: I haven't implemented a floodfill with a queue before, but I also do some hacky solutions to things being self-taught lol

 AntiSquid: trying to find an animated gif
 jacek: use queue to search for it
 AntiSquid: ... this discussion is way too long lol
 EmirGanovic: hello
 AntiSquid: hi EmirGanovic
 thanshaw: yeah you add to the queue from the back of the list, and DEQUEUE from the front
 thanshaw: if you;re using a linked list, but it's similar with arrays and other data structures i think
 NINJAPRIYANSH: Hi!

 AntiSquid: if you also engage in a meaningful conversation once a month why not&#160;?
 Boreal:&#160;?
 Boreal: oh nice
 Boreal: well

 jacek: oO
 Wilster: -=W=-
 MadKnight: is that the W from your nick?

 SunnyCommitter_8582: hello does anyone knows what kind of problemes oracle gives for fullstack engeneers
 SunnyCommitter_8582: and if they are timed
 AntiSquid: ya i just found out on google
 SunnyCommitter_8582: what kind of problems found here?all graphs and mazes related?
 AntiSquid: very varied, but not related to fullstack for most part
 AntiSquid: why oracle btw? i see negative interview reviews
 AntiSquid: need to cook something ttyl, will read chat when i return if you wish to answer
 SunnyCommitter_8582: cause i like the company
 SunnyCommitter_8582: and if i fail i gained some experience anyway
 SunnyCommitter_8582: win-win for me
 SunnyCommitter_8582: especially since it is my first job after graduating
 SunnyCommitter_8582: btw i don't live in US so it is a good choice here
 SunnyCommitter_8582: can you help with what topics to focus on in exemple:graphs,dynamic programming etc
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: fullstack topics
 SunnyCommitter_8582: i have a test here first :D

 SunnyCommitter_8582: yeah
 SunnyCommitter_8582: a challenge i think
 AntiSquid: never done mine on CG
 AntiSquid: do some of the puzzles
 AntiSquid: if you can get decent rank in one of the multiplayers i think you should be fine

 AntiSquid: problems for interviews are usually very random and vary from company to company
 SunnyCommitter_8582: yeah,i got rejected from an interview cause i didn't explain how djistra works lol,hate randomness
 SunnyCommitter_8582: anyway ,thanks for the help,will try your challenge
 Astrobytes: Was Dijkstra relevant to the job?
 SunnyCommitter_8582: nah,i m fullstack dev,don't see graph theory that relevant
 Astrobytes: Well if you're called upon to be doing some backend stuff you very well may have to be.
 AntiSquid: hey i had to do a reverse engineering puzzle in one of the interviews and it wasn't relevant to my job, but it was related to the company and its history sort of, still most fun interview puzzle of them all :D Astrobytes
 SunnyCommitter_8582: guess i just did,'t expect that
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: yeah, that sounds fairly cool actually
 AntiSquid: job was for coding using an in-house created script language basically and some side tasks different languages
 Astrobytes: SunnyCommitter_8582: they might be using graph based tech for one or more aspects of their product(s) so...
 SunnyCommitter_8582: yep ,i understand :D
 Astrobytes: Fullstack means fullstack, not as little backend as possible and loads of frontend :P
 AntiSquid:  well it's oracle, do a bit of research you should find out very soon where you need them
 Daymato: hi, do I learn javascript or php after html css&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 AntiSquid: quite sure graphs can be useful for some of the backend stuff, some .
 AntiSquid: but sometimes it's like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/e7/7c/dbe77c7503740fd647815708b8a4a265.gif">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/e7/7c/dbe77c7503740fd647815708b8a4a265.gif</a>
 SunnyCommitter_8582: and i ll just copy the implementation from google,as all devs do
 AntiSquid: hm you might get something similar in the interview, better be prepared lol

 SunnyCommitter_8582: does the impostor syndrome ever go away?
 SunnyCommitter_8582: most devs i know suffer from it
 AntiSquid: maybe if you wouldnt fail graphs
 Astrobytes: lolOnly if you're fully confident in your expertise.
 SunnyCommitter_8582: sad squid noises
 Astrobytes: It's not just a dev thing.
 Astrobytes: Also, look at it as hubris vs humility. You have to know when to go for one and balance it out.
 AntiSquid: funny but you're not helping anyone, not even yourself
 AntiSquid: just acknowledge where you stand, realize it doesn't matter, try improving, simple @_@

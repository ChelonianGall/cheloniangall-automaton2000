 ANONYMOUS42: so you'd have to sacrifice rounds to figure out the rules?
 miszu: in c++, how you use n_th element on an array? I am getting operand error even if I provided a comparator predicate
 ANONYMOUS42: what do you mean by use?
 miszu: there is nth_element() function in C++. You have to pass an iterator. I want to use an array instead of vector but getting weird error when compiling
 miszu: in google there isn't much help
 ANONYMOUS42: i don't know if this helps but here i can see examples using normal arrays with nth_element

 miszu: let me play with it a bit. thanks
 miszu: need to review how template works in c++
 miszu: see lot of it in documentation not knowing exactly how it works
 ANONYMOUS42: you can just start with working examples and go on from there
 miszu: yeah exactly
 miszu: thanks
 ANONYMOUS42: you can solve that green red puzzle with one line in ruby
 ANONYMOUS42: though i feel like the validators could have been a bit more challenging with some edge cases
 trngxbro: Who can help me that ex about ALPHABET reverse&#160;!
 ANONYMOUS42: can i share the solution to puzzles that are still not validated
 ANONYMOUS42: A harder version would have multiple objects at once and you'd try to maximize the score 
 ANONYMOUS42: but you'd probably need some more information about what's to come to make a more "intelligent" algorithm
 trngxbro: can you share your link
 ANONYMOUS42: what's this alphabet reverse problem
 eulerscheZahl: "A harder version would have multiple objects at once and you'd try to maximize the score"can be solved with dynamic programming
 ProCoder03: is github hacktoberfest only for first time contributors or for all&#160;??

 Sadeegh: Hello my friend
 PouyaSabeti: hi
 PouyaSabeti: how are you
 Medoo: Hey, I'm trying to manually play the Spring Challenge 2021, where can i play?
 eulerscheZahl: you buy the board game Photosynthesis and find a friend
 eulerscheZahl: there is no bot vs human mode
 jacek: what would happen if someone contributed this game month before the contest eh
 eulerscheZahl: almost no one checks the contributions, even after approval
 jacek: i meant the spring contest
 jacek: could be coicedence
 eulerscheZahl: i understood that
 eulerscheZahl: btw we have 25 days to take the contest picture and code our own bot game around it
 jacek: struct, you heard that
 jacek: an alt eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/74195660d27c9a0d41cca1a16881372e6ada">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/74195660d27c9a0d41cca1a16881372e6ada</a>

 Medoo: Does emojis gets stored in 3 bytes?
 nikogabro: yes
 Medoo: But not all of them, right?
 Medoo: I think there are 4 byte emojis too
 ProCoder03: yes, there are but there is not much support for them :confused:
 struct: I wont make any more contributions jacek sorry

 zakacat: This website is amazing
 zakacat: Am I only the only person who is old.... or does everyone think this is fun
 zakacat:&#160;?&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: define old. most of us regulars are grown up and out of school
 zakacat: hmmm
 zakacat: 31
 eulerscheZahl: 30, you win
 TheBlueBias: :older_man:
 zakacat: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: but there are much older users as well
 Medoo: Where's BobLob
 BobLob: Hanging out in clashes
 zakacat: I wonder why this industry seems to be the most progressive in teaching new talent? By a huuuge margin
 zakacat: The other sciences are still very conventional
 eulerscheZahl: it's relatively easy to do it in IT. of course you have to code it, which takes time. but you can create something out of nothing but your imagination
 ShannonNorris97: I teach computing at a UK college (typically ages 16-18), and we seem to have so many more young people wanting to pick it up this year. Our computing courses got a lot more learners than usual
 Medoo: Because there is competition, stress somehow benefits of it's development
 TheBlueBias: Because most of its members are associal geeks and you can't take them the classic way. :3
 ProCoder03: It super fun to learn and you are free to do what the hell you want to. while other sciences are boring and mostly governed by laws of nature which you can't break literally.
 zakacat: But programming is governed by super strict laws as well
 ProCoder03: programming is, but thinking isn't...
 zakacat: I agree with being able to do whatever your imagination can conceive though, especially with today's computing power
 zakacat: Interesting takes tho
 jacek: you can do fun stuff on computer. can you do fun stuff during math lecture?
 jacek: or *blarh* physics?
 Medoo: you can think about fitting maximum amount of circular shapes in a box
 Medoo: maybe spend your whole lifetime with it
 zakacat: hahaha
 zakacat: I love physics, but yes, will destroying
 Wontonimo: that's great to hear ShannonNorris97 about the new interest in programming
 ProCoder03: was it supposed to be a private msg&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: no
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah our numbers often fluctuate Wontonimo but this year it's just risen massively
 ProCoder03: found it :stuck_out_tongue:
 ProCoder03: sorry
 ShannonNorris97: It's great to see, especially since we run a few comp courses. One is more general, and the other is development focused. And the development one is doing better
 eulerscheZahl: when i wanted to take computer science for my final years at school (set my checkmark on a list of courses), it turned out that it wasn't even offered. just a standard list
 ShannonNorris97: wow that's so annoying. I remember at school we finished our IT qualification early, so some of the students requested a more technical computer science course. And instead they offered us a small qualification in animation... cause that's the same apparently
 ProCoder03: yeah, even in our school we had a surge, usually it was for Banking and accounting.... but this saw a record increase in CS students
 ProCoder03: *this year
 eulerscheZahl: that's almost like offering a Word and Excel class
 ShannonNorris97: Exactly, which just so happens to be what our original IT course was haha
 ShannonNorris97: We had an awesome opportunity for learners the other week, one I wish I'd had in my studies, but was still incredibly grateful for now. The Chief Digital Officer of Microsoft came to do a talk for the learners, and opened up to questions at the end about current projects and stuff
 ShannonNorris97: It's amazing to see the stuff on offer now, and to see how much it's changed in how many people are interested and then how many are willing to support it. Even in just the 8 years since I was in that position
 eulerscheZahl: was about time to get that into school. so much stuff in our daily life in a computer, even if we don't see it directly
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not a fan of just accepting something as magic
 Benji-the-scripter: hello

 rafaelSorel: Hi guys, does the format of fallchallenge changed&#160;? it is not an individual contest anymore&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: it's a team contest and you will be done after 1-3 hours. no bots&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: make sure to use the survey on the contest page to tell them if you like that change
 Q12: I know what my answer will be :disappointed:
 rafaelSorel: yes for sure, this is not expected&#160;!!
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it coming, still disappointed when I saw the official announcement
 rafaelSorel: any link to the survey&#160;?
 Q12: there will be one in the end of the contest, I believe
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/escape/fall-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/escape/fall-challenge-2021</a>bottom right corner emoji face
 eulerscheZahl: also has a textbox when you click it
 rafaelSorel: done, hope they change it, but I am a little bit skeptical.
 eulerscheZahl: it won't help for the Fall Challenge
 eulerscheZahl: the question is: how will the next contest look like?
 eulerscheZahl: i think we can influence their decision a bit
 eulerscheZahl: they have some history of doing polls and drawing conclusions that you didn't expect
 Q12: maybe we can open a thread in the forum about it and users will show that they prefer the bot programming contest. maybe this will have a greater influence on them 
 TheBlueBias: :rofl:

 Astrobytes: Ethical Grip Horns and Satchel Hiring Pro for my real name
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Must... stop...
 Astrobytes: Good post btw Scarfield
 Scarfield: ty&#160;:)
 Scarfield: I hope CG will take the negative feedback to heart. i did enjoy the escapes we tried, but certainly not what i expect from a contest
 Astrobytes: Yeah, exactly. I feel it should be totally separate
 Astrobytes: As teambuilding and a bit of fun the escapes are great, but it's not even remotely in the same ballpark as bot programming (or even puzzle) contet
 Astrobytes: *contest
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I still wish them luck for it
 Scarfield: indeed, i think they are doing it to promote the escapes, but its only going to give backlash from the coders that come back for the bot contest im afraid
 Astrobytes: Yeah of course. As the post above yours in the forum thread said, it's a separate product, why replace something that works well already with it? Needs its own promotion/time slot
 Astrobytes: Meh. Anyway, I'll leave it at that.
 Scarfield: yea he was on point, liked his post as well. but figured the more who voices their disappointment the better
 Astrobytes: Definitely. They need to hear it, even if it's a vocal minority.
 Scarfield: hopefully participation numbers will speak for itself, im not participating mainly because i dislike the idea of it happening again
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm also not participating on principle.
 Astrobytes: I just don't get pushing the non-coder part when the contests are for coders, on a coders website
 Astrobytes: which is full of coding puzzles and some fairly hardcore bot programming/optim challenges
 Scarfield: exactly! I guess they have been busy on creating the escape part, and because its probably going to be a better way to create income, down-prioritized making a contest as the usual
 Astrobytes: All comes back to product at the end of the day, if they wanna replace everything with this, it's their call
 Astrobytes: Sure, I mean they might be bombarding businesses with this as a team event to push the product, I would.
 Scarfield: yea
 Scarfield: and its a good product to be fair, just misplaced as a contest
 Astrobytes: Yeah, exactly
 Astrobytes: Not gonna lie, I'm not confident about the future of contests, I hope I'm wrong
 TheBlueBias: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: It would be the saddest thing if the community was blown apart like that
 Scarfield: im sharing your doubts, fewer contests a year, new escape platform
 TheBlueBias: no more sdk-based things for companies
 Scarfield: really would be, this is by far the platform i have been on the longest
 Astrobytes: I *think* they can still request it, but they're pushing Escapes harder
 Astrobytes: @TheBlueBias
 TheBlueBias: hm
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: yeah, I mean I'll still stick around for the community bot games (if that still continues) but it won't be the same
 Scarfield: "if that still continues"&#160;:'(
 Scarfield: i havent even thought of that
 Astrobytes: I don't see any reason why it shouldn't but who knows
 Astrobytes: I'm less worried about that than the contests
 Scarfield: sure, but now im sad :p
 Astrobytes: Sadfield
 Scarfield: truthstrobytes
 Scarfield: if only they would allow community contests
 Astrobytes: You can still do informal ones but it ain't the same.
 Astrobytes: Still, it is what it is.
 Scarfield: true, and yea its a sad time to be a codinggmaer
 Astrobytes: Let's see how it goes
 Scarfield: goFundMe's for prices, and informal contests arranged via forums/discord
 Astrobytes: It's the reach that is missing
 18Baguette: Hello world!
 Scarfield: hi
 Astrobytes: You end up with the same people who play the community-made games only
 Astrobytes: (the same hardcore players that do the community multis I mean)
 Scarfield: yea true, but if a few people would donate a few dollars for price money, you could win 30$ and that will draw others in :p
 Astrobytes: Hm. Still needs a lot of work to advertise. Without a front page splash on CG you won't get many people.
 Scarfield: just get euler to hack their mail, problem solved
 Astrobytes: wtf lol

 Scarfield: Ana Armas?!
 Astrobytes: Toadfinger :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Ah ok, 2 reasons
 TheBlueBias: Léa... Léa... Adèle. :scream:
 Scarfield: i mean.. she is... toy breasts
 Astrobytes: Hahaha, some film that
 Scarfield: Daniel Craig is great as Bond i think, definately going to see it
 Astrobytes: Never been a fan of the movies tbh
 Scarfield: bond movies in general, or the craig ones?
 Astrobytes: In general.
 Astrobytes: He's good, for sure.
 Scarfield: i really like them, even read a few of the books, they were shit though :p
 Scarfield: no idea how they got that popular
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: when it comes to spy/espionage books nothing beats John le Carré
 Scarfield: i still havent finished constant gardener for some reason, it was great though
 Astrobytes: The Bond stories might as well have been playboy serials
 Astrobytes: Finish it, great book. Don't think he ever wrote a bad one
 Scarfield: postponed watching tinker, tailor, soldier, spy because i want to read it first. just dont read as much any mor
 Scarfield: anymore*
 Astrobytes: Yeah read it, books are far better, some of the film adaptations have been good though
 Astrobytes: Same. Gotta make the time sometimes
 Scarfield: yea, one of my dads friends got me into reading his works, just stopped reading in general before i finished it
 Scarfield: there is a mini series with gary oldman that should be really good for tinker, tailer..
 Astrobytes: Yes I believe that's good
 Astrobytes: Haven't seen it
 Scarfield: oh audiobooks is what happened of cause
 Astrobytes: Meh. They're good but bad at the same time
 Scarfield: yea, there are 2 danish speakers i have found so far to be great. i literally search for books they are the speakers for, but the app i got doesnt have many english language books&#160;:(
 Scarfield: heard almost every book Jan Guillou wrote though, probably my favourite auther
 Scarfield: but he is sweden, so automatically drops a few places :p
 Scarfield: swedish*
 Astrobytes: hahahaha, such a Swedishist
 Astrobytes: and Frenchist
 Scarfield: i only hate people who are intolerant to others cultures... and the swedes
 Astrobytes: It's tricky to find the good narrators for good books. Nothing substitutes for actually reading
 Astrobytes: Hah!!! :rofl:
 Scarfield: narrator was the word!
 Astrobytes: I got what you meant&#160;:)
 Scarfield: yea, but listening to a story while cooking/cleaning is just great, but true nothing beats looking at wood and hallucinating
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh :D
 Scarfield: anyway, good talk&#160;:) im off for today
 Astrobytes: Indeed! Alrighty, catch you later man, take care

 Brian_Z96: What's it like doing a coding assessment here on codingame?
 Astrobytes: Brian_Z96: I'm not sure if the test area is still there for the assessments, used to be on codingame.com/work
 Brian_Z96: Thanks!!
 Brian_Z96: I'll take a look
 Astrobytes: But your best bet is probably doing easy &amp; medium puzzles
 Astrobytes: To get used to the platform
 Astrobytes: And it depends on the job you've applied for, the employer may have customised tests or just use the stock puzzles
 miszu: so I optimized my code bettwe to run offline and accoarding to the profiler, this is my main bottleneck. I don't think there is much to be done here:
 miszu: nth_element(open_array, open_array + min(open_length, BEAM_SIZE), open_array + open_length, high_score_predicate);
 Astrobytes: seems fine, this is for 2048?
 miszu: yeah exactly
 miszu: I notice in my profiler that it doesn't use 100% of my cpu
 miszu: 13% only
 Astrobytes: Are you profiling in VS?
 miszu: correct
 Astrobytes: bear in mind that CG has multiple machines with differing CPUs and uses gcc
 miszu: if you run my code offline for 2048 it doesn't really matter CG platform
 miszu: unless you tell me that gcc compiler is better than VS compiler
 Astrobytes: Oh right, you're doing offline solution, my bad
 miszu: but still, I expect to use 100% of my cpu
 miszu: but only uses 13%
 Astrobytes: make it work harder :P
 Astrobytes: Do you get a working solution?
 miszu: yeah, I am letting run for minutes
 miszu: using beam size of 65k
 miszu: so it does 2-3 reps per second
 Brian_Z96: Sounds good, thank you Astrobytes!
 Astrobytes: Brian_Z96: No worries&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: miszu: Are you getting better scores?
 miszu: Astrobytes unfortunately my online score is better than offline lol
 miszu: but I will let it run this time till the end
 miszu: I think by the time I go deep, I excluded lots of path that has better results
 Astrobytes: Test each part of your code and make sure it's returning sensible results. This happened to me when doing stuff offline for CG.
 miszu: so my heuristic might be the issue
 miszu: it does, after each iteration of bm, I see the best score
 miszu: and it makes sense of the logic I implemented
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b58f0a83-d4bc-404c-b923-b865d67bd455">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b58f0a83-d4bc-404c-b923-b865d67bd455</a>
 miszu: this is an output and by looking at it, you can see it is a good path
 Astrobytes: are you in debug mode?
 miszu: yes
 Astrobytes: switch to release
 Astrobytes: enable optimizations that you want
 miszu: let me see how to do it lol
 Astrobytes: It's the dropdown menu up top
 miszu: ok it is faster now
 miszu: but I click the "debug local window"
 miszu: now it's just a debate of my heuristic. Should I use score + snake pattern grid or just snake pattern grid
 Astrobytes: experiment and find out&#160;;)
 miszu: :P
 Astrobytes: You can enable certain optimisations in the project properties btw
 miszu: eah I need to look it up
 miszu: from top of your head do you knwo some?
 Astrobytes: this should help:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/optimizing-your-code?view=msvc-160">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/optimizing-your-code?view=msvc-160</a>
 miszu: yeah in project properties  I found some
 miszu: also used some pragmas
 Astrobytes: yeah the pragmas are handy for turning things on and off as you're progressing with the profiling
 struct: Hi
 Astrobytes: the website has links to descriptions of all the optims
 miszu: yeah I am looking at
 Astrobytes: struct will instruct you in this from now on
 miszu: but still my 13% cpu didn't go up haha
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: do you have 8 cores?
 miszu: i7 2600k
 struct: 8 threads yes
 struct: 100/8 = 12.5
 Astrobytes: (I was looking at his optimisation first before getting to multithreading)
 struct: ah
 struct: I thought he was wondering why he was only using 13%
 Astrobytes: Oh he is. 
 Astrobytes: There were other issues, such as debug mode etc
 struct: on visual studio I mostly just switch to release mode
 struct: The profiler I use on windows is Intel Vtune miszu
 struct: the visual studio is not that good for c++
 struct: the profiler I mean
 miszu: well the profiler in VS shows me that my botleneck is the nth element
 miszu: I mean what else I need as info
 struct: what does your nth_element look like?
 miszu: nth_element(open_array, open_array + min(open_length, BEAM_SIZE), open_array + open_length, high_score_predicate);
 struct: also the nth_element implementation on msvc is different from gcc
 Astrobytes: nth_element(open_array, open_array + min(open_length, BEAM_SIZE), open_array + open_length, high_score_predicate);
 Astrobytes: ah lol
 miszu: is there a way to tell visualstudio to use gcc?
 struct: you need wsl 2
 Astrobytes: No but you can do that from VSCode I think
 struct: I dont know how good windows gcc is
 miszu: but at that point is just about speed
 miszu: my solution offline is less good than online
 struct: how much difference?
 miszu: big magniture
 miszu: online I get 500k as score and offline I get 90k ish
 struct: and the number of sims is the same?
 miszu: no lol
 miszu: I use 1000 as beamsize online and offline 65536
 struct: cant you have a bug on the offline version?
 miszu: offline when you are deep like 300 moves, you lost a lot of branches
 miszu: I think it's the algorithm issue
 Astrobytes: I did suggest some unit testing
 miszu: there is no bug because it is similar to the online
 miszu: just that no time limit
 miszu: unit testing is my field :P
 miszu: remember?
 Astrobytes: Did you try the 1000 beam width offline?
 Wontonimo: hey struct and Astrobytes and miszu
 Astrobytes: hehehe yeah
 miszu: yeah
 struct: hi
 miszu: hey
 Astrobytes: Heya Wontonimo
 struct: This seems like a bug to me
 miszu: Wontonimo you went far in 2048
 miszu: can I ask you something about your secret salsa?
 struct: No way that longer time and bigger beam would give worst result
 Astrobytes: Was my first thought struct
 Wontonimo: thanks.  i did a DFS of depth 6
 miszu: WTF
 struct: This is a perfect information game afterall
 Wontonimo: and not offline at all
 miszu: struct the issue is after each turn online, you restart the sims and you explore more branches than if you start at 0
 Wontonimo: i played A LOT of 2048 irl
 Wontonimo: so i have a strategy
 miszu: Wontonimo but you use a heuristic right?
 miszu: not just vanilla bfs
 Wontonimo: yeah, based on my real life experience
 Astrobytes: This is where the 'snake' comes from
 miszu: I used a heuristic of snake pattern
 struct: what do you mean explore more?
 struct: also you dont need to call nth_element everytime to keep the best N
 struct: do an if
 miszu: struct you miss less potential branches when you start later in the game than if you started at move 1
 struct: instead of min+
 Wontonimo: first, try down.  then left, then snake.
 struct: 4-&gt;16-&gt;64-&gt;256-&gt;1024-&gt;beam-&gt;1000-&gt;4000-&gt;beam-&gt;1000
 struct: this should beat what happens
 struct: ofc you wont have 4 moves every turn
 struct: sometimes it will be less
 Wontonimo: it's really a dumb heuristic, but in real life it works fantastic.  manually i've got to 32,768 without using a program.  it took weeks
 Astrobytes: I have had more than that, it took months
 Astrobytes: Next time I make a screenshot
 miszu: struct so you hit your beam after 4 iterations let's say?
 struct: in that example yeah
 struct: because you can move in 4 directions
 miszu: btw just to be sure about the snake, we talk about this right?
 miszu:     int weightGrid[4][4] = { {1,2,3,4},
 Astrobytes: Patterns vary but yes
 miszu: my heuristic is just that
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's the pattern i use, BUT it is exponential in evaluation 
 miszu: the grid value * the weighted grid
 miszu: I tried exponential and went worse lol
 struct: this was my nth_element miszu
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd098a3e-90b3-4996-a97e-a7b09e6bad11">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd098a3e-90b3-4996-a97e-a7b09e6bad11</a>
 struct: the if will check if it needs to be beamed
 struct: also its normal that on visual studio the nth_Element is what takes the longest
 struct: if your beam size is 2^16
 miszu: each node has 4 child so ofc everytime you will need to run nth
 struct: why everytime?
 miszu: let's say beam size is 100
 struct: ok
 miszu: each one of them has 4 childs
 miszu: so 100*4
 miszu: which busts your beam already
 Wontonimo: so, to be clear, I only only only expand left, right, and down.  I never expand up.
 struct: ok but you dont need to do it on the first 3 turns
 struct: like
 struct: 4*4*4 = 64
 struct: is &lt; 10
 struct: 100
 miszu: ok I will save like 0.5 sec lol
 Wontonimo: 3 children ... reduce your search to 3 childrrn
 struct: yeah on that game you are right
 miszu: Wontonimo I tried that but my program failed because it reached an end state
 Wontonimo: weird
 Wontonimo: i don't know why mine would work and yours wouldn't.  maybe you removed the wrong direction
 miszu: ok so my program stopped at this end state
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a50c67b-5d84-4b8c-8599-0e470764b4b4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a50c67b-5d84-4b8c-8599-0e470764b4b4</a>
 miszu: dat 256 in the middle
 Wontonimo: hmm, i was wrong.  for the 1st move, i explore all directions, for everything past the first move ...
 Wontonimo: for (int i&#160;: new int[]{2,1,3}) { 
 Wontonimo: that's it
 miszu: ok so after first move you explore all directions?
 miszu: wait the oppositle lol
 Wontonimo: first move, all directions.  Eval of that first move only includes 3 directions.  i'm reviewing my code now
 Wontonimo: it's been a while since i coded this thing
 miszu: just for fun... after each iteration I print the  best score and the worst score in my beam memory... curious if by any chance they are reversed
 Astrobytes: bug bug bug bug bug bug bug
 Wontonimo: bug?
 miszu: still checking. nothing unusual
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/88ad7307-832f-4294-9c2f-83a4978b5269">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/88ad7307-832f-4294-9c2f-83a4978b5269</a>
 miszu: I see there are a lot of dups of states
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 Wontonimo: all of those are death states
 miszu: I got back couple of moves, you see small differences
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe8c3f93-8af4-4b4d-b5a6-ff83d2d8bb86">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe8c3f93-8af4-4b4d-b5a6-ff83d2d8bb86</a>
 Wontonimo: that first one
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff245a98-8b73-4be9-b3f6-cc8a8b4acd4f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff245a98-8b73-4be9-b3f6-cc8a8b4acd4f</a>
 Wontonimo: is ordered badly
 Wontonimo: the third column is poorly ordered
 Wontonimo: that is where you are dying 
 Wontonimo: in the 3rd column, if the 3rd and 4th row were reversed then you'd be golden
 miszu: yeah but I don't know why my code do it that way
 miszu: my 2d array of weights are in snake
 Wontonimo: it isn't "snaked" properly probably
 Astrobytes: check your code
 Astrobytes: watch those x,y and i,j,k vars
 struct: this is why i name them i1, i2, i3
 Astrobytes: :D
 miszu: int weightGrid[4][4] = { {1,2,3,4}, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c8920033-42b0-4d5b-a59b-c1ec9992f05e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c8920033-42b0-4d5b-a59b-c1ec9992f05e</a>
 miszu: there is nothing wrong here lol
 Wontonimo: ah, so in addition to the snaked values, 
 struct: There is if you go over 2147483647 score
 struct: i meant 2^31
 Wontonimo: i start at the highest value in the snake, and go back.  once i see a value that is HIGHER than the previous in the snake, i stop counting all of the rest.  
 Wontonimo: nothing out of order counts for score
 Wontonimo: because it is going to kill you
 struct: this is snake or 2048
 miszu: 2048
 Wontonimo: yes, 2048
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/2048">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/2048</a>
 Wontonimo: if your values in 2048 are out of order (according to your snake) you will die soon.
 miszu: Wontonimo that is a good idea but I assume my heuristic is smart enough to figure that out
 Wontonimo: it isn't
 Wontonimo: code it in
 Wontonimo: it made a huge difference in my scoring
 miszu: yeah but don't you need to make a worse move to get a better result
 miszu:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: no.  2048 is always about keeping everything organized
 Wontonimo: highest in one corner, then decreasing as your snake out
 miszu: so if I understand, if in any state, there is out of order you remove it?
 miszu: even a stupid 4 and 2?
 Wontonimo: i remove all scoring from anything after something out of order
 miszu: ok so partial scoring?
 Wontonimo: yes, even stupid 4 and 2.  an empty square is 0.  so if a 2 or 4 is after a 0, then it is not counted in my scoring
 miszu: like only give points of correct ordering?
 Wontonimo: yes, only points for correct ordering
 miszu: ok perfect
 Wontonimo: that's what i do
 miszu: I understood you would give a fat juicy 0 overall haha
 miszu: it makes totally sense
 Wontonimo: obviously there are many people with higher scores than me, so there are obviously different ideas out there
 miszu: I will explore struct idea if there is an overflow
 miszu: but I doubt it at that low scoring
 miszu: a bit complicated to calculate the scroing as a code
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c1354f59-e8c7-40ba-99ca-76beb29ca83a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c1354f59-e8c7-40ba-99ca-76beb29ca83a</a>
 miszu: because you need to reverse
 miszu: yeah makes sense thanks
 miszu: ok so Wontonimo heuristic helped me a lot
 Hyperplane: Hi Guys welcome to MY mc LeTs PlAy
 miszu: so my profiler now tells me this is super slow which is the part where append previous moves to the new move
 miszu: temp-&gt;path = beam_array[i]-&gt;path.append(DIRECTION_TO_LETTER_LOOKUP[j]);
 Hyperplane: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29d08303-78e3-4e46-9e8e-8bc74ab72673">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29d08303-78e3-4e46-9e8e-8bc74ab72673</a>

 gilufin: in ruby you can do p :hw
 Redoxi: Hey, are here beginner friendly puzzles? i learned vars, conditions, loops, arrays but i dont easy i still too hard for me :D
 Redoxi: but i dont understand the puzzles*

 bt05: hello
 Wontonimo: hey Redoxi
 Wontonimo: check out this puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8985401a9db51556e3a0445eec98f888914cf6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8985401a9db51556e3a0445eec98f888914cf6</a>
 Wontonimo: i think it would fit what you are looking for
 Wontonimo: it is beginner friendly
 Redoxi: Thanks @Wontonimo ^^ i will try that out!
 struct: nice puzzle
 struct: never saw it before
 Wontonimo: There is a second one in this series <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/89857511ca97a1353976310b03570fbdd0f970">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/89857511ca97a1353976310b03570fbdd0f970</a>
 struct: good for beginners
 Redoxi: Yeah i think i still need to use some vs before i come to here. for example i've never seen Parse. I did the tutorial series from brackeys.
 Wontonimo: what's your programming language of choice Redoxi?
 Redoxi: I'm learning C# right now
 Wontonimo: cool.  you can use that for a lot of things.  Also, if you like programming things with graphics you can use it for coding in Unity3D.
 Redoxi: Yeah i wanna start using Unity at some point but i think i stlll need to get a deeper understanding of Classes etc.
 Redoxi: And im also interested in a.i but i think that will also take some time to understand
 Wontonimo: do you know what a struct is?
 Redoxi: no not really :D i started 3 days before and i have a little bit knowledge of variables, conditions, loops and arrays. Learning Methods rn after that comes Classes
 Wontonimo: nice
 Redoxi: Yeah its kinda difficult to understand at the beginning because there are a lot of words like static, void, all the variables how to write the loops etc. trying to not forget them and doing daily challenges xD
 Wontonimo: have you ever seen when two variables are often used together, like an X and Y coordinate?
 Redoxi: No, the most thing i did with Arrays etc. was to Sort movies do a list, loops where numbers get ^2 or sort in alphabetical order and so on
 Redoxi: so really the simple things
 Hyperplane: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ioinformatics.org/page/getting-started/14">https://ioinformatics.org/page/getting-started/14</a>
 Wontonimo: that's good.  now imagine you have to sort X,Y coordinates according to their distance.
 Wontonimo: you could have 2 arrays, 1 of all the X's and 1 of all the Y's and then write all the code to make sure they keep in sync
 Wontonimo: but it would be way better if you could have a new thing called something like "point" that had 2 values , X and Y
 Wontonimo: then you'd have an array of points
 Wontonimo: and you don't have to worry about 2 arrays getting out of sync
 Wontonimo: make sense?
 Redoxi: hmm so use Array.Sort to sort them in order you mean? Or am i wrong coz i didnt got what you mean with "sync"
 Wontonimo: yeah, you got it.
 Redoxi: yay ^^
 Wontonimo: if you had 2 arrays, one of X and one for Y, then your sort will only sort one of them
 Wontonimo: then the values won't be lined up with the other array anymore
 Wontonimo: making a new thing called "point" is an example of a class.  It's purpose is to bundle related data together.
 Wontonimo: in addition,
 Wontonimo: say something you'd like to do with X/Y coordinates is find the distance to another X/Y coordinate
 Wontonimo: that's a function, and that function very much is related to point
 Wontonimo: so, it would be great to bundle it with the X/Y in point, so your code is all nice an organized
 Wontonimo: that's really what classes are all about imho
 struct: also do not get discouraged if you cant solve the puzzles on this site
 struct: They require a bit of experience
 Redoxi: hmm okay i better copy paste this in my word data :D
 Wontonimo:&#160;:)
 Redoxi: Yeah i did the standard things like i said only class is missing and im still lost on the easy puzzles ^^
 Redoxi: I will look for easier puzzle in the internet until i feel comfortable with them
 Redoxi: i think that would be the best instead of hanging around here clueless in the easy puzzles
 Thorcode: wow you are so cool Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: the "easy" puzzles here are hard for beginners.  Do come back regularly and keep trying though.  It'll feel great once you code a few
 Wontonimo: thanks?
 Redoxi: Yeah i know. It felt great when i could do the puzzles that "Brackeys" gave at the end in the video and that was nice to have a program that works even if it is simple
 Redoxi: A guy in Discord told me that i should look more into Classes and get a deeper understanding all of that. Think that would be my next goal 
 Wontonimo: you may find site nice <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codewars.com/">https://www.codewars.com/</a> , but once you are good with classes and functions, come back here
 Redoxi: Oh that looks nice ^^ Do i need to register? so it saves my progress?
 Thorcode: the codewar is hard, I took me a few hours to solve a puzzle&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: I think the intro puzzles are okay.  You can also 'admit defeat' I think and get to see a solution.  If you do that it keeps you in your same league instead of challenging you with problems from the next league
 Thorcode: or I can search for the ez puzzle on that&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: ++
 Redoxi: Nice i think i will do that for an hour now before i go to work ^^
 Wontonimo: see you around Redoxi :wave:
 Redoxi: Yeah, thanks a lot for the help! ^^
 Thorcode: Guys if my screen in output of codewar is red is it wrong?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: codewar?
 Thorcode: it is a site
 ja_fica: How to tell the compiler to change a single operator using template functions
 ja_fica: for example, I have a function that I want to us | for all operations all over the function in multiple lines

 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu you didn't submit a bot, i can't play against it
 miszu: I did but it's in bronze
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh you are ranked over 1k so it won't let me find it
 miszu: I am coming soon though
 miszu: I am improving m bot
 miszu: I can beat my old bot so I just submitted
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i am 793rd so, get in silver
 miszu: hopy to be there soon&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its fun to watch  $this-&gt;gbyid[$id]-&gt;v

 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't sim, only heuristics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: first time i did floyd algorithm on CG
 miszu: you don't need to sim in this game
 miszu: to reach legend
 miszu: why floyd and not dijkstra?
 miszu: you improved a lot
 miszu: by the time I reach silver, you will be gold
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last submit was 3 years ago
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess i called it floyd...hmmm, but it'
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's dikstra with a twist
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did average bot, but it was most fun for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did a greedy version that doesn't worry about defense...it got me to silver
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my midgame factory upgrades suck
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bomb predictions make a big difference
 PatrickMcGinnisII: g/l
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lemme know when u get silver, i still can't find
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or in top 1k
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can see down to 307th in bronze
 Bahnschrift: how's AOC going for everyone?
 LLG: Patrick mine's around top silver if you want something to fight
 PatrickMcGinnisII: LLG just wanted to see miszu 's play, working on there is no spoon ep2
 LLG: INC is a tricky thing to work around for sure
 Aaron153: this stuff scary, all i see is numbers
 Rockstar555: hii
 cegprakash: what does it mean my search race bot races well in depth=6 but bad in depth=5 or depth=7
 BoBot: omg, AntiSquid, why you do this&#160;:(<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/513172190">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/513172190</a>
 BoBot: that game is a metaphor for capitalism - the rich giving the poor just enough to feel like they are still in the game...
 BoBot: to make them feel like*
 laPetiteGrenouille: what should we do if we think that an exercise is buggy, for example an input that would work badly please
 BokiBg: hello, can I debug the code I write on site?
 struct: yes, print to stderr
 jacek: good morning
 jacek: im so good i love points when winning&#160;:(
 jacek: lose*
 Uljahn: laPetiteGrenouille: each puzzle has a dedicated forum thread, so go to the forum, use search and describe a bug in the thread
 tarikyildiz: hello
 [CG]Maxime: hi
 jacek: oO
 [CG]Maxime: [CG]Thibaud better?
 [CG]Thibaud: it seems
 [CG]Thibaud: thanks
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 tarikyildiz: I am also new to python, the puzzles on this site are very difficult. How can I understand?
 tarikyildiz: I like this site very much.
 jacek: try different puzzles
 Uljahn: tarikyildiz: make sure you've tried Power of Thor ep.1 and the Descent, those puzzles have hints tab on the left panel to help you understand interactions with the CG platform
 tarikyildiz: thank you so much
 jacek: :thinking:
 Rockstar555: :smile:
 YodaMaster123: Can someone send the list of optimisation pragmas? I finished my search algorithm for Coders Strike Back and am working on optimisation.
 struct: #pragma GCC optimize("O3","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 struct: YodaMaster123
 YodaMaster123: Thanks&#160;:)
 Uljahn: what about "-ffast-math"? guess it could work in CSB
 YodaMaster123: What does it do? Use approximations?
 Uljahn: ye, none accurate math calculations
 Guinsoo: Wait you can do that
 Guinsoo: Back to C
 jacek: use Ofast instead O3, it will do other 'dangerous' optims as well
 UnnamedCodinGamer: does anyone know what are the top guys doing in 2048?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: locally I get to around 150k per test case
 UnnamedCodinGamer: vs 2 million for top of the leader board
 Uljahn: are you using beam search?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, with some basic heuristic
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have also tried simulated annealing
 UnnamedCodinGamer: which scored a bit worse
 Uljahn: im using snake-shaped scoring for tiles alingment and just three possible moves
 Uljahn: *alignment
 UnnamedCodinGamer: [[10,8,7,6.5],
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I tried this scoring
 UnnamedCodinGamer: from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and all moves
 eulerscheZahl: the stackoverflow scoring isn't a perfect fit here, as we know the spawn of new tiles in advance
 eulerscheZahl: so forming a snake might work better
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks I will look into it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am just wondering if the scoring can make such a huge difference
 UnnamedCodinGamer: more than 10 times better
 Stonk: Hello
 ArianPunk: hey
 emh: hmm
 emh: I'm thinking to start a new web site
 emh: which needs well-defined problems and solutions
 emh: but it's about learning new languages more than it is about solving problems
 emh: I'm wondering if it's possible to piggy-back on CodinGame somehow
 emh: does the license allow it?
 emh: if there is another web UI and the user logs in with his CodinGame account on my site, can he run through the CG validators from my web site? or would that be breaking terms?
 LastRick: I guess it depends on which part of the site you're borrowing from. Hopefully one of the mods can direct you to an answer.
 LastRick: That said, I've mentioned here before the "Learn" tab is probably the most awkward part of the site. It could be utilized so much better.
 miszu: correct me if I am wrong but the strong point of codingame is the AI bot competition
 emh: hmm. I guess it would be even better and less integration work if I could start with a predefined set of problems, like a github repo with problems and solutions. anyone have good links?
 ZarthaxX: so you will make a repo with CG problems solutions and then people copy pasta them?
 ZarthaxX: :P
 LastRick: miszu: I have no idea. It would be interesting to find out what the users think the strong point is. I came to CG about six months ago because it was suggested on Reddit as one of the few places to practice Dart. So, contests and bots are far less important to me. But that's just me
 emh: ZarthaxX hehehe.. no that would be up to users in that case, but now I have the idea to look for an existing repo for some problem set
 emh: something like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mahmudahsan/203-ACM-Problems-Code">https://github.com/mahmudahsan/203-ACM-Problems-Code</a>
 emh: this one is C++
 ZarthaxX: i have seen some
 ZarthaxX: related to CG
 ZarthaxX: emh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/denvash/codingame-puzzles-solutions">https://github.com/denvash/codingame-puzzles-solutions</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i think i've read somewhere that all CG puzzles are Creative Commons
 eulerscheZahl: ah, found it again
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/licensing">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/licensing</a>
 emh: eulerscheZahl true. but still.. not everyone has access to all solutions. so it wouldn't be good to republish in any case
 eulerscheZahl: this makes projects like my puzzle search possible
 eulerscheZahl: publishing solutions is something different and i totally don't encourage you to do so
 LastRick: agreed
 eulerscheZahl: (sorry, didn't read all the chat above)
 ZarthaxX: what toad said&#160;:)
 emh: although what's already in public repos I guess it's okay? or?
 emh: like the one ZarthaxX just posted
 ZarthaxX: that one was posted by toad the other day
 eulerscheZahl: we don't usually share those links on the chat
 ZarthaxX: because a guy copypasted vox codei very hard puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: fail me
 ZarthaxX: hence this problem we are mentioning :D
 ZarthaxX: you played yourself :P
 eulerscheZahl: i have a suspicion that some users took the solutions of problem creators and submitted those
 eulerscheZahl: as higher levels have access
 ZarthaxX: yeah that's a problem&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: the resistance one from that repo is impressive
 VizGhar: I have found repo with all very hard puzzles solved, while looking for some articles... might be very tempting for some to use it
 VizGhar: another sad thruth is, they were working :P
 VizGhar: (not submitted them tho)
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc3445b0-3745-458f-af07-edbb11897d49">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc3445b0-3745-458f-af07-edbb11897d49</a>
 emh: damnit
 emh: too long message
 emh: hehe
 eulerscheZahl: tl;dr
 emh: keywords: universal compiler. crowdsourced
 eulerscheZahl: too short, i don't understand
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 emh: hehe
 emh: I consider two programs to be equivalent if their output is the same (and I add logging statements to trace each function call or assignment)
 emh: users will get points if they can create some regex-like patterns
 emh: which successfully translate programs
 emh: regexes will target the abstract syntax tree
 emh: examples of these patterns can be found at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/emnh/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/blob/master/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/TranslatorForPattern.cs#L68-L242">https://github.com/emnh/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/blob/master/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/TranslatorForPattern.cs#L68-L242</a>
 VizGhar: Can somebody assist on tron? i'm just tring to fill the space when i'm trapped. There must be something faster then DFS/BFS
 emh: for example S("Do\nA\nLoop Until B", "while (true) { A; if (B) break; }"). it's a translator pattern from VB6 to C#
 eulerscheZahl: depends on how you want to use your DFS VizGhar
 eulerscheZahl: to check the number of reachable cells: it's fast
 emh: so I'm interested in the list of these patterns from any language to any language. and thinking it's a nice data set to gamify / crowd source
 eulerscheZahl: to enumerate all possible paths: slow
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like an interesting yet complex problem emh
 emh: thank you&#160;:) . it could eventually be turned into a product for transpiling source code. given enough quality patterns
 VizGhar: yeah like inverse traveling salesman...OK I'll just try to lookup 4-5 steps forward and score remaining region
 jacek: voronoi plx
 eulerscheZahl: there are some algos to help you detect regions that are only connected by 1 cell
 eulerscheZahl: so you have an area to fill. but it's 2 components so when you go to the other side once, there is no way back
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm</a>

 ZarthaxX: woah
 eulerscheZahl: i liked one for directed graphs. there's an undirected version too
 eulerscheZahl: linked*
 eulerscheZahl: you can even create a new graph of those components and count how big they are. to decide which of 2 neighboring components is the better option
 eulerscheZahl: German literature names it "Superstrukturgraph" (at least that's how my prof called it), I don't know the English name
 eulerscheZahl: so that's basically a tree on an abstract level
 eulerscheZahl: but you have multiple nodes inside one of your tree nodes (components)
 ZarthaxX: why are you talking about a tree now? 
 eulerscheZahl: you have strongly connected components (you can do a circle inside but no back and forth between other components)
 eulerscheZahl: so you can see those single components as a node (with a graph inside), just abstracting
 eulerscheZahl: and those components form a tree on a bigger level as they are only connected via a single edge
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, i'm turning into a smits, that wall of text
 eulerscheZahl: sorry
 jacek: so, what are your opening moves for this
 VizGhar: :D I'm having fun thanks... You really know a lot of terminology. That's what I'm missing most
 jacek: AutomatonNN has at least something to learn from
 AutomatonNN: for few months ago with some heuristics to find it
 AntiSquid: i will do it yesterday or the day after AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what are you doing now?
 eulerscheZahl: i had a lecture about this. and a prof who's really accurate and wants students to understand
 AntiSquid: ah you didn't pay attention you filthy bot AutomatonNN .
 jacek: impossible
 AutomatonNN: color in robotics or something like that
 eulerscheZahl: not much content. i wrote about 10 pages in a full semester only
 eulerscheZahl: but going in depth
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl wow nice abstraction
 eulerscheZahl: as opposed to another prof (compiler building), who had 80 power point slides each week
 ZarthaxX: and smito writes way more anyway hehe
 jacek: going in depth like dfs
 Astrobytes: that's a pretty cool way of looking at the connected components
 VizGhar: I'll have to spend at least a year here just to switch my thinking to these kind of problems... I'm here for just like 2 months and feeling waaaay behind you
 VizGhar: So far only 3 bots in gold...
 ZarthaxX: dont compare to the toad, he is a prodigy
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: hey Zartho
 ZarthaxX: also in general, dont compare to others haha
 ZarthaxX: just improve yourself&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: hi astro
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 VizGhar: :D understood
 Astrobytes: ^^^^^ this 100%
 AntiSquid: ^
 VizGhar: I wanna be the very best, like no one ever waaaaas DUM DUM DUM
 ZarthaxX: pokemon theme in the background
 ZarthaxX: anyway keep asking questions here, many people know a lot about doing bots and can help u&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: also look at postmortems of the multiplayer you are doing
 eulerscheZahl: tron is too old, probably not much interesting stuff to find
 AntiSquid: retirement might come faster than catching all pokemans, just do something worthwhile / what you can .
 Astrobytes: Check the post-mortems after you've given it a go, preferably
 eulerscheZahl: but for the newer games: post mortems share a lot of interesting ideas
 jacek: what wants to work for remi? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kayufu.com/job.html">https://www.kayufu.com/job.html</a>
 AntiSquid: i wish some of the community games had postmortems
 AntiSquid: although ... it might ask for too much
 eulerscheZahl: what a detailed job description that is
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl thought there were postmortems of tron, but the google one
 ZarthaxX: werent there?
 eulerscheZahl: true
 Astrobytes: you can learn more in chat regarding the community games tbh, ask the right questions to the right people
 eulerscheZahl: slightly different game but a good read
 BoBot: @eulerscheZahl - I thought what you described - Superstrukturgraph - is a "graph of graphs", and that was called hypergraph in English - but now I look at the definition and I am not sure any more
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2010/03/04/google-ai-postmortem.html">https://www.a1k0n.net/2010/03/04/google-ai-postmortem.html</a>
 VizGhar: :D that job offer...
 jacek: or, using godwin's law, provide wrong answer. someone will be eager to correct you
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar check what toad linked above
 ZarthaxX: maybe helps
 Astrobytes: that's not Godwin's jacek
 eulerscheZahl: the hypergraph is not a perfect match of what I was describing
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: how do you feel about the "Blocking" game or B because people here love acronyms
 eulerscheZahl: the components should only be connected on a single edge
 ZarthaxX: hypergraph?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, they should share 1 node
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20hypergraph%20is,edge%20connects%20exactly%20two%20vertices">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20hypergraph%20is,edge%20connects%20exactly%20two%20vertices</a>.
 BoBot: yea, but it is possible one is the generalization of the other, or they are equivalent...but I am not sure
 ZarthaxX: ohcool
 ZarthaxX: man i just had a subject about graph theory and they didnt teach all this
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 VizGhar: yeah I've opened it earlier today thanks...anyway. I've seen there is a way how to run those referees locally (if there is source) You are probably using it for every single competition right? can't imagine posting every single change to the CG IDE
 AntiSquid: refund ZarthaxX
 BoBot: I think I heard "graph of graphs" being called a hypergraph in a podcast, but that was probably an inaccurate term then
 jacek: meta graph?
 AntiSquid: mother-graph
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid probably i will ask for one
 BoBot: this is a term related to that<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)</a>
 tibithegreat: clique is a set of nodes that form a complete subgraph
 tibithegreat: if I remember my graph theory correctly
 ZarthaxX: yep
 BoBot: yea, I was thinking of connected cliques in that "graph of graphs", but the subgraphs are not necessarily fully connected I guess
 eulerscheZahl: clique is more strict
 eulerscheZahl: "strongly connected component" is the term for the groups i was referring to
 BoBot: yea, I already googled for the german name and realized I had to look for directed graphs :D
 tibithegreat: euler: but that graph of graphs isn't a tree, I think it's a directed aciclyc graph
 tibithegreat: for strong connected components
 tibithegreat: might be wrong but pretty sure it's not necessarily a tree
 BoBot: If each strongly connected component is contracted to a single vertex, the resulting graph is a directed acyclic graph, the condensation of G.
 tibithegreat: yep
 BoBot: so I guess it is called a condensation then :D
 tibithegreat: that's what I meant
 BoBot: never heard of that term
 tibithegreat: aa me neither, but most of my teachers loved to use romanian terms
 BoBot: it is an interesting abstraction, I think it can describe a lot of things - like finding single points of failure etc..
 tibithegreat: so it's a pain trying to figure out how to translate scientific terms
 eulerscheZahl: true, for directed graphs it's a DAG and not necessarily a tree
 tibithegreat: there is a different problem for that
 tibithegreat: it's called biconex components I think
 tibithegreat: (that's word by word translation of romanian term)
 tibithegreat: critical points in a graph is a node which if taken out the graph is now disconnected
 tibithegreat: and biconex component is a component which has no critical node
 eulerscheZahl: and for undirected graphs it's not called "strongly connected"
 eulerscheZahl: "zweifach zusammenhängender graph"have fun translating
 tibithegreat: lol
 tibithegreat: and the graph of biconex components is in fact a tree
 tibithegreat: for undirected graph you have just simple connected components of the graph
 tibithegreat: or biconex components
 tibithegreat: biconnected components is the actual term
 tibithegreat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component</a>
 eulerscheZahl: nice, that image illustrates the components too
 tibithegreat: yeah
 tibithegreat: it's a bit of a pain because you have nodes that belong to several components tho
 tibithegreat: Question: when doing MCTS, do you guys do multiple simulations after selecting a node
 tibithegreat: or just one simulation for every "select" step
 tibithegreat:&#160;?
 tibithegreat: I'm trying to get legend in UTT and reached rank 40 in gold for now
 tibithegreat: but I'm kinda out of optimization ideas
 eulerscheZahl: i do standard MCTS rollouts from root to end of games
 eulerscheZahl: one after another
 eulerscheZahl: you need 20k-25k in turn 2 for legend
 tibithegreat: I'm at 15-20k in turn 2
 eulerscheZahl: then you are too low
 tibithegreat:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: in ranks
 eulerscheZahl: you probably have a bug
 tibithegreat: hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: recently a user was only checking for horizontal and diagonal rows but not vertical
 tibithegreat: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i probably have a bug with a similar severity
 eulerscheZahl: as Nerchio stated:there are 2 kinds of MCTS in gold. low performance and buggy implementation
 tibithegreat: with 15k in turn 2 I should be higher than rank 40?
 tibithegreat: since it's 20-25 for legend I assumed this was just the way it is supposed to be
 miszu: tibithegreat have you tried teccle strats early?
 tibithegreat: teccle strats?
 tibithegreat: what's teccle strats?
 miszu: so if it is a new board, play the move that brings back the opponent to the same board
 eulerscheZahl: while i needed that 20k-25k to promote, i was around top5 gold with 10k rollouts alreay
 eulerscheZahl: might have changed now that more players entered the arena
 tibithegreat: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: but your rank 40 sounds low for that amount of rollouts
 tibithegreat: I was surprised to see I passed silver without actually doing MCTS
 tibithegreat: like I just took the board position, and ran as many rollouts as I could
 tibithegreat: picked the move that got me the best wins
 tibithegreat: this got me from bronze straight to gold
 miszu: it is a suboptimal mcts but the strategy is good enough
 miszu: it makes sense what you did
 tibithegreat: well I knew I was gonna go for mcts
 BoBot: isnt that the naive MCTS? without UCT?
 tibithegreat: this was kinda of an intermediate thing
 tibithegreat: like "let's see if I implemented the rollout properly"
 tibithegreat: and apparently I did
 miszu: 98th in  bronze league in gitc
 miszu: almost...
 therealbeef: I should have gone mcts as well&#160;:( doing minimax, 3.3 million root node evals in turn 1 and still barely top 100 in gold -_-
 therealbeef: leaf node, sorry
 miszu: therealbeef yeah you need mcts here
 miszu: no choice
 miszu: apparently there is one dude in high legendary with minimax
 miszu: I dunno what is his secreat sauce but..
 miszu: it is possible
 therealbeef: I'm stubborn&#160;;) it should be possible
 therealbeef: learning a lot about optimisation
 miszu: avoid malloc and vectors
 miszu: and should be enough to reach the 20k sims
 therealbeef: 1 in 10 games times out before bot startup due to server bug though. doesn't really help
 jacek: you need good (or not crappy) eval for minimax. none public for uttt as of yet
 jacek: hence most are using mcts, and the 'true' mcts, not early playout termination as it would still require eval
 struct: eulerscheZahl the number of legal states for positions is 729 right?
 struct: for stc
 eulerscheZahl: what's a position?
 eulerscheZahl: but i recognize that 3^6 number
 struct: lets see if I can word it better
 struct: 2^6^2 == 4096
 eulerscheZahl: i use that 3^6 too
 struct: But the correct number is 3^6 I think
 struct: Yeah
 struct: Thanks
 arkwaw: I tried to make some game with SDK, and locally its working fine, but on server preview i can't see it (though judging by the console it is working)
 arkwaw: nvm, switch off, switch on, helped like with everything
 jacek: aww

 LogalogScholar: Thanks a lot no wonder math.dist doesn't work
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: past your bedtime already isn't it euler?
 Astrobytes: you go early in the winter months
 ZarthaxX: toad hibernating

 Astrobytes: Hyperhiberhypnotoad
 jacek: teasing who? AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: except you can do it with my brain
 Sergen: hey I caught someone cheating. You can literally copy past the code and see it first result on stackoverflow
 Sergen: anything that can be done?
 Sergen: ruins CoC
 Sergen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1489780690ca2da9d98066ca95518a5b4adeb9c">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1489780690ca2da9d98066ca95518a5b4adeb9c</a> first guy
 Astrobytes: we can't see that code
 Sergen: so nothing can be done?
 Sergen: I can screenshot
 struct: you can try and report
 struct: if you go to his profile there is an option
 Sergen: ok thanks
 Astrobytes: but was the problem a very generic problem?
 Sergen: he copied a function. The function has exactly 1:1 same names and structure
 Sergen: it isn't 1,2 lines either
 jacek: great minds think alike :v
 Astrobytes: there are no rules against copying a function from stackoverflow or anywhere, you are free to google as you wish during a clash if it suits you
 SPDene: I don't think there's any "you're not allowed to copy/paste" rule
 Sergen: that gets a lol from me. Whatever.
 Astrobytes: Do puzzles instead then
 SPDene: I'm not joking. there is no such rule
 Sergen: which is funny
 Astrobytes: hey, clashes aren't meant to be taken over-seriously, they're supposed to be a bit of fun
 therealbeef: it's lame, and unethical I think
 Astrobytes: copy-pasting whole solutions is lame and unethical
 Sergen: I think anyone with common sense would agree 
 Sergen: but apparently not the rule maker
 SPDene: I'm not saying it's ethical - but trying to police all occurrences of "someone on the internet did something a bit bad" would ne insane
 Astrobytes: Feel free to make a complaint, it's an open forum
 Sergen: right, so what you are saying is competitions should not be regulated
 Sergen: that sounds reasonable
 __atomic__: I can see that it would be a hard rule to enforce (who's to say where the line is drawn?) and it comes down to a flaw in problem design more so than anything. If the problem is so generic someone can google the answer you should make better problems 
 jacek: no no, puzzles and multiplayer are more regulated
 Astrobytes: Well, like I said, clashes are informal
 Astrobytes: Puzzles and especially multiplayers are definitely regulated
 Astrobytes: Contests are checked for duplicate code, cheating etc
 Astrobytes: Point is, chill about the clashes. If you don't like what someone did, move on and do another one.
 jacek: dont forget to invite toads into one, they like them
 Sergen: I get it, I get it. I just wanted to know how to report and was surprised that pasting is allowed.
 Sergen: first time I am complaining out 100s of clashes
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't worry about it tbh, really. I mean there're official bots that copy-paste user code when there's not enough human players so...&#160;;)
 Sergen: alright thanks to everyone informative
 Astrobytes: All good, keep it fun I say. Ignore the crap and crack on
 jacek: AutomatonNN do you cheat
 AutomatonNN: what is the most problem with the code of the weak&#160;?

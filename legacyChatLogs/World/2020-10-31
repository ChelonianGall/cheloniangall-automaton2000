 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BOO
 The_chosen_one: I hate cats
 PatrickMcGinnisII: who has the ban hammer?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BOO as in ghost:"BOO!" for Halloween
 eulerscheZahl: i have :hammer:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :poop::sunglasses::smile_cat:
 The_chosen_one: poo
 The_chosen_one: pooo
 The_chosen_one: poo
 eulerscheZahl: stop it The_chosen_one
 The_chosen_one: ok sorry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: finally got hitori solver working
 jacek: happy Caturday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Black Caturnight
 dbdr: Frohe eulerscheTag
 eulerscheZahl: *Reformationstag
 eulerscheZahl: a holiday in some parts of Germany but not here in Bavaria
 eulerscheZahl: Saturday anyways, so it doesn't matter
 dbdr: oh, it's an official holiday somewhere, didn't know
 dbdr: makes sense in germany&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: in Bavaria we have one tomorrow: Allerheiligen
 eulerscheZahl: something religious, i don't know the details
 dbdr: all saints
 dbdr: trictrac created a multi for himself :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/blocking/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=wood1">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/blocking/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=wood1</a>
 dbdr: is the boss the same as his bot? :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only 95 people have done Hitori solver, interesting
 trictrac: no the boss is max^n depth 2 and my bot is max^n time limited
 eulerscheZahl: a strong boss, is that why you disallow download?
 trictrac: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wierd, demo allows leaderboard, but errors
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but looks like its live
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sleepytime, don't turn into Block Heads
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/b6xEYl6">https://imgur.com/a/b6xEYl6</a>now i'm at 3 world chats already :D
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation</a> eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: TL;DR
 eulerscheZahl: but the other #worlds are boring, just me
 eulerscheZahl: 1 is even still connecting
 dbdr: TLDR: i \hbar \frac{d}{d t}\vert\Psi(t)\rangle = \hat H\vert\Psi(t)\rangle&#160;;)
 dbdr: but was just a joke reference to the concept name
 eulerscheZahl: i'll read that tomorrow in your chat log wiki .D
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 dbdr: does it interpret TeX?
 eulerscheZahl: if you embed it properly, i think so
 eulerscheZahl: $\frac{1}{2}$
 dbdr: noice
 eulerscheZahl: do you use the $ in wiki?
 dbdr: me? how should I know? :D
 dbdr: <a class="external free" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DollarSign">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DollarSign</a>
 dbdr: so it might need enabling
 eulerscheZahl: nah, will just break PHP code snippets
 dbdr: nice blocking by robo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/496455034">https://www.codingame.com/replay/496455034</a> frame 110+
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i thought "that's a long match of BLOCKING"
 eulerscheZahl: to see a c4l replay
 dbdr: ah, you're working on Blocking?
 dbdr: ah, title, got it
 dbdr: now we need a c4l strat in the Blocking multi, to make things symmetric
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just idle in the chat till the next contest
 dbdr: charging your batteries? :D
 eulerscheZahl: playing topcoder :D
 dbdr: TC is more similar to puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: optim
 eulerscheZahl: 7 days
 eulerscheZahl: wednesday - wednesday
 eulerscheZahl: and it has a kovi and a tourist competing
 eulerscheZahl: also siman
 dbdr: oh, optim
 eulerscheZahl: marathon match
 dbdr: one week?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: for me marathon is a month+
 dbdr: one week is contest-length&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: TC calls it a marathon match
 dbdr: &gt; TopCoder currently allows coders to utilize Java, C++, C#, or Visual Basic .Net as a competition programming language.That's very limited
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: fine for me personally but no Rust for you
 dbdr: :pitchfork:
 Light-Bringer: Hey I have a problem with a puzzle
 alhassan: Damn this is fun!!
 eulerscheZahl: describe your problem
 Light-Bringer: ok so i have my program whih is doing what  want
 Light-Bringer: but the last solution does not seem to match the problam
 Light-Bringer: i mean the one expected
 Light-Bringer: bcs my program does what he should
 eulerscheZahl: which puzzle are you talking about?
 Light-Bringer: bank-robbers
 Light-Bringer: the last expected is not right in my opnion
 eulerscheZahl: solved by 5000 users, maybe it's your fault. what answer would you expect?
 Light-Bringer: 6442500
 Light-Bringer: i mean arnt the 5k just vruteforcing the solution for each cases
 Light-Bringer:&#160;?
 Light-Bringer: because i  pretty sure my program is right
 Light-Bringer: it works for every other case
 eulerscheZahl: they get the same answer as the expected one at least. i don't know their method
 eulerscheZahl: let me read the statement again dist
 eulerscheZahl: first
 Light-Bringer: thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we should compare our numbers for each vault first
 eulerscheZahl: to track down the problem
 Light-Bringer: sure
 Light-Bringer: i have the list
 Light-Bringer: if you want it
 eulerscheZahl: paste it here
 Light-Bringer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/206e311b-a930-4ed8-add2-71bd71c652f9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/206e311b-a930-4ed8-add2-71bd71c652f9</a>
 Light-Bringer: oops
 eulerscheZahl: that's fine
 Light-Bringer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c211cccf-d8a6-442a-b823-26329db33840">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c211cccf-d8a6-442a-b823-26329db33840</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i got the same numbers
 Light-Bringer: oh it s automatic
 Light-Bringer: okok
 eulerscheZahl: longer texts become a pastebin
 Light-Bringer: okok
 Light-Bringer: i have the time per robber
 Light-Bringer: for each round
 Light-Bringer: if you want
 eulerscheZahl: so the assignment of robbers to vaults seems out of place for you
 Light-Bringer: hum but each robbers does a vault then goes to the next one
 eulerscheZahl: share that code segment please
 Light-Bringer: or you have to take into account the time each robber takes for a vault and they do more than the other if they have easy vaults?
 eulerscheZahl: the robber starts with the next lock immediately after finishing the previous one
 eulerscheZahl: so they can get out of order
 Light-Bringer: ok that s why then
 eulerscheZahl: but locks are started sequentially
 eulerscheZahl: just robbers swapping
 Light-Bringer: okok that s my mistake then
 Light-Bringer: thanks&#160;:)
 zapakh: How to unfollow someone?
 eulerscheZahl: hit the button where the "follow" button used to be
 zapakh: It says "invite"
 eulerscheZahl: hover over the profile pic to get a popup
 eulerscheZahl: or open the profile page
 zapakh: thx
 351062: Hi
 Neumann: Did anyone posted his 2048 scores&#160;? I saw one pastebin a few days earlier but I don't know who's scores is it, and it's weirdly indexed :P
 wlesavo: it probably was yurkovAS, but he improoved a little since
 Neumann: Ok thks
 eulerscheZahl: i can give you my scores :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Number shifting is close to a change at the top
 wlesavo: wow nice
 dbdr: Neumann: 62,535,564
 Neumann: I hate you
 dbdr: :D
 Neumann: I'm coming for you
 Neumann: Watchout
 dbdr: oh, you're #1 in the 56M category, nice!
 __Nilu__: #
 __Nilu__: #1
 Neumann: 57M *
 wlesavo: dbdr nice score :grinning:
 dbdr: thanks wlesavo!by the way, anyone has that pastebin at hand?
 Neumann: I have but I won't give it to you
 Neumann: On a more serious note, the original pastebin expired
 Neumann: I'll let the author repost it if he wants to
 Illedan: Doing 2048 offline Neumann?
 Neumann: Kind of
 Neumann: I'm not yet to the stage of locally optimising shit offline for every test-case
 Neumann: Soon tho
 Illedan:&#160;:+1:
 YurkovAS: my 2048 scores<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Ks7dw5NW">https://pastebin.com/Ks7dw5NW</a>
 siddharthdeo99: good
 Neumann: Thanks YurkovAS
 alhassan: Guys I'm in results page my name says "Pending Results..."
 alhassan: There is an issue I'm facing.. I did all tests correct but then it tells me 50% score..
 alhassan: I think it's because I added a comment I forgot to remove..
 sahilrox: The validators are different than the test cases, meaning you could theoretically pass all test cases and still get 0%.This is done to prevent hard coding answers.
 Westicles: YurkovAS, looks like those are your old scores.
 Westicles: Only up to ...408
 vtenneke: does anyone have any tips on unfolding paper (very hard) i've been cracking my head on trying to make up a formula since I'm failing on a high amount of folds.
 vtenneke: or is there another way that would be better
 eulerscheZahl: a region can be at several edges (not not be there)
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. if it's at the top right corner, where will it be after unfolding? what happens if it's not connected to any edge?
 wlesavo: can we get one of the moderators in #ru for a quick ban
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i have power there
 AhmedH2O: guys i have a problem in horse racing i made a working  code and tried it my ide and it works but it doesnt work in the game, thanks in advance for your help
 hem123: what programming code?
 BlaiseEbuth: AhmedH2O: What doesn't work&#160;? tests or validators&#160;?
 AhmedH2O: tests
 AhmedH2O: python is the programing code
 hem123: can you show me the code?
 AhmedH2O: sure 1 sec
 AhmedH2O: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/20bd08aa-e25c-40f0-bb6f-d2dbbf673b96">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/20bd08aa-e25c-40f0-bb6f-d2dbbf673b96</a>
 AhmedH2O: im sorry its missing a print here is the working one 
 AhmedH2O: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/821d1049-91f4-422b-9324-9c7f54ec7bb7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/821d1049-91f4-422b-9324-9c7f54ec7bb7</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Why have you "pi &gt; ans" twice&#160;?
 AhmedH2O: yes i want it to set the second highest number
 AhmedH2O: it changes sec to the last greatest number before changing the answer to the greatest number
 hem123: the 2nd if doesnt do anything
 hem123: but the goal is not to find the highest strength
 hem123: it is about the ones closest by eachother
 AhmedH2O: ohhhhhhhhhhh
 Alhassan: Guys how do I check verified answers for a clashofcode?
 Alhassan:  
 Alhassan:  
 Alhassan: Because no one did js here
 Flamanis: Afaik you can only see what other people did that showed in your specific clash.
 Alhassan: Oh ok&#160;:(
 JD12: gg wyatt
 TatsuJoestar: is clash good for beginners?
 TatsuJoestar: like I don't expect to win, but is it good practice?
 MattSOrme: probably not beginners, better starting with easy puzzles
 MattSOrme: the time limit will probbaly demotivate a beginner
 vtenneke: I'd say depends, it does teach you some cool basic concepts and you. learn to use them quickly
 Alhassan: Anyone know a extension that makes u see the question after submitting answer?
 ParticleBeam: I really cant see how to compact this Python code any further...
 Zenoscave: pewpew
 Zenoscave: Is there a way to sign osx cli binaries without a developer account? I just want to distribute a c# binary. not profit off of it. dumb apple
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: how do I get the elevator position on don't panic ep1 into the game loop so i can use it?
 ParticleBeam: Array?
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: ty
 Laminator: I posted my first contribution for the site. I hope it doesn't already exist :p Feel free to take a look! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5644248f945c9d2600736b0a1b486174a881">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5644248f945c9d2600736b0a1b486174a881</a>
 Alhassan: I have an issue..
 azh412: .
 PatrickMcGinnisII: clash huh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh laminator is gone,2 hours ago, ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no one here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, well this can't hurt then... i did a thing today...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.flnerd.com/knife.mp4">http://www.flnerd.com/knife.mp4</a>
 ParticleBeam: Finally. managed to get below 200 chars...
 Zenoscave: Hey Patrick
 Majeck: I wanted to optimize my pathfinding algorithm a "little" anf got it down from taking over 2 seconds in a 100 x 100 grid to less than 50ms
 Majeck: Binary search is amazing
 Majeck: *and
 LastRick: yes it is
 Skynse: dang
 Skynse: I've been working on the cat and mouse problem for like 2 hours now. The math is hot
 Skynse: I believe my solution is optimal enough. Only problem is that the mouse hits the edge of the pool but doesn't win
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Yea
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: You need to go like 1 unit further
 Skynse: ...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: You need to get past the edge of the pool
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I add/subtract 81 from my destination'
 Skynse: I used a math formula to calculate the closest point from the mouse to the edge of the pool that's probably why it didn't work
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Yep. THe mouse is just sitting at the edge
 Skynse: dang, it friggin worked
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;:)
 Skynse: 1 problem
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;?
 Skynse: now the simple one doesnt work lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: What's happening?
 Skynse: mouse decided to go straight to the cat and gets stuck in one place
 Skynse: gotta change my boundaries a bit
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Went straight to the cat...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: smart mouse
 Skynse: yeah lol
 Skynse: It's probably cause of my 0 angle condition
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: The way I do it is 1) Head straight to the point across the pool from the cat 2) if the distance from the mouse to the midpoint of the pool is equal to the distance of the arc between the cat and the target, head for the point across the pool from the mouse
 Skynse: ...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: That's the most efficient way
 Skynse: might as well scrap my if conditions then lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: If you're already passing the testcases no need to change
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: This is just the way I do it
 Skynse: wtf
 Skynse: I just subtracted 1 from one x coord and boom
 Skynse: haha now my other testcases are fooling
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: You don't just subract one...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: If targetx &lt; 0 subract 1, elif targetX &gt; 0 add one
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Same with y
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Replace 1 with 81*
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: So-If targetX &gt; 0: targetX += 81elif targetX &lt; 0: targetX -= 81
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: And repeat for y
 Skynse: your solution is pretty lit, it worked for the first case flawlessly
 Skynse: I realized that it is guaranteed to escape if it starts from (0,0)
 Skynse: but in some cases, it doesn't start from there so Im trying to make it get to (0, 0) as the first step without any other conditions interrupting 
 Skynse: How did you find the point furthest away from the cat though?
 Skynse: Like, the point on the circle far opposite that of the cat

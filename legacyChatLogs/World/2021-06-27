 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Should I invest more time into learning Ruby or C++?
 Jackevmi: i think c++ because it is more commonly used
 TYJung: uh im new to coding and what should i do for starters
 Talulita: Hii everyone, by any chance does somebody know how to make a carousel with multiple elements with Angular?
 jacek: those clash of codes are getting more and more difficult ;d

 rocketman7: hi there
 rocketman7: How I can get to next boss when I beat current boss?
 geppoz: if you stay a while over the boss in the leaderboard, after a while you will be automatically promoted
 rocketman7: ahha thanks mate!
 jacek: coders strike back?
 rocketman7: yeah

 KP56: in Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, how do I chose which board I want to put an X at?
 AntiSquid: received the longest wiki article copy paste in private message ever ... talks about the US constitution 
 AntiSquid: account meanwhile deleted it seems
 Vintarel: KP56 if the O was on the bottom left of its cell, then you have to play on cell at the bottom left of the board
 KP56: that makes sense, thanks
 KP56: wait isn't it just about winning in every single board then?
 KP56: and there is the best mathematical solution for that making you always win or tie
 MSmits: if you mean this game is solved, then no it's not
 KP56: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.rd.com/article/how-to-win-tic-tac-toe/">https://www.rd.com/article/how-to-win-tic-tac-toe/</a>
 MSmits: different game
 MSmits: we're playing ultimate tic tac toe here and it's a unique version at that
 KP56: oh maybe because im in bronze league rules are the same as the normal tic tac toe game
 KP56: except there is 9 boards
 MSmits: yes, which means it's a very different game&#160;:)
 MSmits: there are on the order of 10^30 different gamestates
 MSmits: Solving it would probably be comparable to solving checkers 8x8
 MSmits: which has been solved, but not without great effort
 KP56: i dont know about other leagues, but in bronze you just move between 9 different boards, so you can basically apply this strategy to every single one
 MSmits: please try it&#160;:)
 KP56: ok
 MSmits: you may get out of bronze with that btw
 MSmits: but not much further
 KP56: what changes next?
 MSmits: nothing
 MSmits: opponents just have better bots
 KP56: wait what happens if you draw on a board
 MSmits: then neither has won that board
 MSmits: it can't be used for 3 in a row then
 KP56: ive just realized i misunderstood the rules
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/563163967">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/563163967</a>
 MSmits: watch that game. It will help
 KP56: ok
 linjoehan: Do we know if the first player wins at UTTT?
 linjoehan: In theory that is?
 MSmits: I am almost 100% sure that is the case yes
 MSmits: it's impossible for p2 to be solved as winner
 MSmits: so it's either draw or win for p1
 linjoehan: why can p2 not win?
 MSmits: stategy stealing argument
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy-stealing_argument">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy-stealing_argument</a>
 linjoehan: but there is not a non significint move that p1 can make
 MSmits: allright, look at it from both situations
 MSmits: say p1 plays middle
 MSmits: then p2 has the same starting situation except for 3 things
 MSmits: 1) there's already a cross, which is worse for p2
 MSmits: 2) he can only play in the middle board
 MSmits: hmm i think it;s 2 things
 MSmits: but anyways, the two differences are both to p2's disadvantage
 linjoehan: I agree but its not a proof though
 MSmits: Hmm if you agree that it is never worse to have an extra mark on the board
 MSmits: absent of all other considerations
 MSmits: because having less movement options is definitely always worse
 MSmits: I agree it's not formal enough but I am 100% sure p2 cannot be solved as the winner. Someone else can formalize it properly
 MSmits: the reason i think it's not solved as draw either is that I've never seen p2 draw a game where p1 did not make a fatal mistake earlier on
 MSmits: I checked many many games by top players
 MSmits: it can always be traced back to a mistake in turn 25 
 MSmits: or so
 MSmits: (ply 25)
 MSmits: also, the higher players are ranked, the higher their p1 winrate
 MSmits: meaning as you get closer to perfect play, p1 wins more
 MSmits: karliso wins 95+% vs himself as p1 vs p2
 KP56: p1 definetely has an advantage over p2
 MSmits: yeah it's pretty obvious but linjoehan was talking about a formal mathematical proof 
 MSmits: that takes a bit more work
 KP56: what you said about algorithms which are closer to perfect getting higher p1 over p2 winrate seems to be a good argument
 MSmits: yes, but also not a mathematical proof.
 MSmits: in any case, the imbalance between p1 and p2 only matters for top bots really
 MSmits: say, the top 100 or so
 MSmits: below that, bots play so poorly that the first move is an advantage, but can easily be overcome
 struct:&#160;:'(
 MSmits: whats up struct?
 struct: hi msmits
 struct: not much, im still wondering how I should code breakthrough
 MSmits: what kind of choices?
 MSmits: the sim?
 struct: Well I want efficiency
 struct: Yes
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: I did boardflips here
 MSmits: I think because I have lookup tables
 MSmits: flipping the board means you only have to look up from one side
 struct: generating moves seems expensive
 MSmits: there's some way to look up the end of the game if a pawn becomes unstoppable
 struct: yeah, I can think of some ways to do it
 MSmits: using pext by looking up the triangular pattern in front o fit
 MSmits: i did that, did not help very much. It's all about having a good board eval
 struct: its ept?
 MSmits: random rollouts are crap
 MSmits: mine is yes
 MSmits: my eval is not good though
 MSmits: I think that's the reason it does not rank well
 struct: smart rollouts doesnt work?
 MSmits: never tried that
 MSmits: i took others on their word
 struct: still seems expensive
 MSmits: not sure what a smart rollout is in this case
 struct: Playing games until the end
 MSmits: i dont see any clear rules
 MSmits: I think this is a very NN friendly game
 MSmits: also ntuple and such
 MSmits: hard to quantify strategy into a handcrafted eval I feel
 struct: maybe I could try
 MSmits: not hard to beat me anyways
 struct: I also looked at D&amp;B, but so many moves
 MSmits: D&amp;B is cool
 MSmits: but you need to get into the math. MCTS or minimax will not do better than random
 MSmits: until the very end of the game that is
 MSmits: My bot literally plays a random move for the first half of the game
 MSmits: then tries to use a nimstring solver until it succeeds
 MSmits: and I rank 2 with that
 MSmits: so... math
 struct: never heard of nimstrings
 struct: I see theres a book for D&amp;B
 struct: describing strategies 
 MSmits: there's more than 1, also a bunch of papers
 MSmits: nimstrings come from combinatorial game theory
 MSmits: the weird thing about D&amp;B is, if you ignore the current score (which is 0-0 for a long time). the game is completely decided by whose turn it is
 MSmits: because the board is colorblind
 MSmits: it doesnt matter who put the lines down
 MSmits: the only difference between the two sides is whose turn it is
 struct: I see
 MSmits: so as you can see that would be hard to eval
 MSmits: also, you cant even give a score to the player who's turn it is, because  you would need to solve the game to know if it's good to be p1 or to be p2
 MSmits: there are some rules of thumb you get by counting chains and such, but if you estimate wrong, you are *completely* wrong
 MSmits: not just * a bit off*
 MSmits: so thats why early game i am just playing random moves. Even the rank 1 player more or less does that. He just starts seeing the future a little bit sooner than I do
 struct: So there is no strategy at the start?
 struct: or is just hard to implement?
 MSmits: I don't think there is one. I dived pretty deeply into this game. The 3rd rank player is an expert at it and wrote an app (he's the guy who invented mcts or some such)
 MSmits: and he doesnt know either so...
 MSmits: "In 2006, inspired by these predecessors,[14] Rémi Coulom described the application of the Monte Carlo method to game-tree search and coined the name Monte Carlo tree search"
 MSmits: from the wiki
 MSmits: so thats the guy that ranks 3 in D&amp;B
 NasrAllah: .
 NasrAllah: is there a section to learn?
 NasrAllah: or just by doing challenges?
 MSmits: if you want to learn basic programming, CG isnt the best site for it. But if you know the basics in at least 1 language, therés tons of options to practice
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 MSmits: some puzzles are made by the CG devs, most by the community
 MSmits: struct, if you do find some way to play D&amp;B intelligently in the early, game, do let me know&#160;:)
 MSmits: in the meantime I can talk your ears off about it
 struct: will do, im still not sure if ill play it or not though
 MSmits: i enjoyed it a lot somehow. Maybe because it was a break from all the typical mcts-board games
 MSmits: I even solved wood-2 and didn't get promoted on perfect play, that was funny
 struct: lol
 MSmits: half the time my bot knew it lost 1-3 in the first turn, so it didnt care anymore
 NasrAllah: Thank you so much @MSmits 
 MSmits: np
 NasrAllah: :D
 TeachMeSenpai: Anyone do Telephone Numbers? 
 TeachMeSenpai: in python
 BlaiseEbuth: About 13876 users.
 TeachMeSenpai: In python? thats false
 BlaiseEbuth: If someone did it in another language he can do it python. So I count him
 TeachMeSenpai: wow thank you, you helped so much
 BlaiseEbuth: I literally answered your question...
 ANONYMOUS42: i think you just have to implement a trie
 ANONYMOUS42: not much to do
 ANONYMOUS42: i'm doing it right now
 linjoehan: Implement a trie yeah that's easy anyone can do that
 TeachMeSenpai: ;o 
 ANONYMOUS42: i mean maybe not that easy
 ANONYMOUS42: but you just have to understand how they work and implement one
 ANONYMOUS42: or at least that's what i'm trying to do rn
 TeachMeSenpai: yeah i create a function that takes in a list and creates a trie,and returns the length. 
 TeachMeSenpai: but i think my logic is bad
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not. That's what I done.
 Westicles: use set
 MSmits: what's a trie?
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie</a>
 MSmits: did you mess up a wiki page again?
 MSmits: it's tree
 MSmits: sheesh
 ANONYMOUS42: it's trieueu
 ANONYMOUS42: and it's pronounced tree
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix your read MSmits
 MSmits: don't you mean ried&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Westicles: it's okay DAWG
 MSmits: woof
 ANONYMOUS42: who let the dogs out
 MSmits: :dog2:
 TeachMeSenpai: OMG
 TeachMeSenpai: im an idiot
 TeachMeSenpai: lol
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 TeachMeSenpai: i did it
 MSmits: it was you!
 MSmits: change it back to tree, now
 BlaiseEbuth: Nam gloria Lucifer&#160;!
 TeachMeSenpai: i just had to count when i was adding to my trie 
 TeachMeSenpai: ughh
 ANONYMOUS42: what were you doing before
 TeachMeSenpai: i was trying to get the length of the trie
 TeachMeSenpai: bruh
 ANONYMOUS42: wouldn't just be the max length of the strings
 TeachMeSenpai: i generated the trie using dict, so it was a bit tricky counting that
 TeachMeSenpai: welp
 TeachMeSenpai: okay time for sleep
 TeachMeSenpai: ty guys
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do it simple...&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: struct: the best genmove I could think of is to generate three bitboards (one for each possible move direction). Cheap, easy.
 struct: oh, seems easy enough
 struct: thanks darkhorse
 MSmits: that's kind of what i did also struct
 MSmits: you can do similar things in checkers, though it's messy due to jumping
 struct: also with EPT
 struct: I still should do rollout right?
 punter147: Hello all, i had a small doubt, i have my mcts implemented using STL, but i have heard STL kills a lot of time becaues of heap operations, do you have any advice on how to replace them? i know i can use arrays for vectors, but i also use map to maintain a list of node and its children as a hash map. 
 struct: punter147 allocate memory at the start
 darkhorse64: In EPT, the best your eval, the shortest the playout. In this respect, you could consider that a0 is mcts-ept with 0 length rollouts
 Wontonimo: use a plain list for the children instead of map or hash
 darkhorse64: + 3 gap in C4, I have been staring at my code for ours, I still wonder what I have done wrong
 Wontonimo: hey punter147, what game are you using MCTS for&#160;?
 darkhorse64: no list, no map, no hash, just a big array of nodes = a pool that you allocate at startup, no delete, no alloc during the game, that's the rules
 Wontonimo: ^^ yes
 struct: I dont feel like I do anything more than you do darkhorse
 struct: on c4
 darkhorse64: you do it better :sweat:
 MSmits: rating gap is not that meaningful I think. Struct's bot is better because it has more performance, sure, but the fact that the gap is 3 probably just means you lose the same game over and over.
 MSmits: struct beats me too, but apparently when yurko submits, I get to rank 1 because struct has losses and I (almost) don't
 darkhorse64: I play 1, go stealed, and always play 4 after which you say is inferior to 3 and lose
 darkhorse64: *got*
 MSmits: yeah 3 is better I think
 MSmits: though they might both be solved as draw in the end
 MSmits: not entirely sure. But in my meta mcts it's much harder for player 1 to come out ahead when p2 replies with 3
 struct: meta might say its better
 struct: but meta also played millions of games
 MSmits: yep
 struct: pure mcts might never find the optimal path
 struct: at least with the time given
 MSmits: sure, but before my meta mcts found this, I did lose a lot more to players like tric trac, who reply with 3, at least sometimes
 MSmits: it's just hard for mcts to see what's good in the beginning
 MSmits: so luck plays a role there
 BlaiseEbuth: He saved the galaxy
 MSmits: you rewatching avengers endgame BlaiseEbuth?
 darkhorse64: in the same position, struct plays 2
 MSmits: or maybe star wars?
 MSmits: wow really
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/566511365">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/566511365</a>
 MSmits: not here
 MSmits: ah wait nvm
 BlaiseEbuth: You hurted my film culture&#160;:(
 MSmits: sorry
 darkhorse64: I mean when his first move 1 is stolen, he plays 2
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: I never steal 1, so i guess it never happens with me
 MSmits: maybe i should try submit stealing 1
 MSmits: see if my bot is better
 MSmits: it's a big change
 darkhorse64: I always steal 1 because I like to be first maybe it's a mistake
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: oh right, he does reply with 2
 MSmits: (and wins just the same)
 darkhorse64: :grin:
 MSmits: I submitted, wonder if this will do well
 Wontonimo: :eyes:
 MSmits: ohh I forgot
 MSmits: wait nvm
 MSmits: I was thinking my book is not calibrated for stealing 1
 MSmits: but it doesnt matter, because it stores both sides
 richiie: i just joined this and i dont understand this, at all
 MSmits: for 3, 4 etc. starts it just stores p1 starts, because i will only ever have that start when someone elses plays and i steal
 MSmits: nope, this connect4 talk richiie, ignore us
 MSmits: meh, not a good submit at all&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: submitting with not stealing 1 and 7, just for the sake of curiosity
 Wontonimo: hey richiie , there are some good bot battles on this site here&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 richiie: thanks! im going to check that out in a bit
 jacek: Marchete so high, did he did that one-hot optimization?
 sprkrd: In C4, how many simulations do you guys do during the second turn? 
 BlaiseEbuth: NaN
 jacek: as many as possible
 struct: sprkrd rollouts?
 sprkrd: and how many is that?
 sprkrd: yes, rollouts
 struct: 300-350k
 sprkrd: do you use a hash table or a proper tree and you don't care for transpositions?
 struct: nope
 struct: I dont care about that
 sprkrd: so a tree of pointers, then?
 MSmits: no tree of pointers
 sprkrd: i'm using a hash table, that may be what is slowing my simulations down
 MSmits: yeah don't do that, that's almost never worth it
 MSmits: we just accept that a fraction of our nodes have identical states to other nodes
 MSmits: locally in meta mcts i do the hash thing though
 MSmits: because it's not a bottleneck there
 sprkrd: when you say locally you mean for your personal projects and stuff?
 Marchete: a bit jacek
 MSmits: I mean i run a meta mcts for connect4 and take into account symmetries and other transpositions when expanding nodes in the persistent tree
 Marchete: but I think it's bugged
 Marchete: I can't train 
 jacek: try tram
 Marchete: I need to recheck the NN part
 MSmits: or metro
 sprkrd: thank you&#160;:)
 MSmits: sprkrd I use PersistentDictionary. It's a C# library. Hold 2 billion items, only simple stuff
 MSmits: I store my C4 states in a 128 bit Guid
 sprkrd: MSmits but do you run that in CG?
 MSmits: no this is locally, to calculate good opening moves and it's also my attempt to solve the game
 sprkrd: ah, cool, cool
 MSmits: in CG, no hashing, just a c++ program, very similar to what struct and darkhorse do
 sprkrd: yeah, I use C++'s unordered_map, I was thinking if I had to write my own hash table implementation or forget about transpositions and just do a tree
 MSmits: struct basically has 20% more rollouts than i do and 40% rollouts than darkhorse does, from what i can tell
 Wontonimo: something that a lot of these people use is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a> to locally test one of their bots to another 
 MSmits: I mostly don't, except during contest when there's no time to write my own stuff and the game is more complex
 Wontonimo: that's cuz you are built different
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 MSmits: so true
 sprkrd: Wontonimo Thank you :D. I know about brutal tester, but I cannot be bothered with Java projects and prefer to build my own arena in C++
 MSmits: I guess it doesnt matter whether i steal 1 or not, darkhorse64
 Wontonimo: you don't need to do it in java
 Wontonimo: it works with any language
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/msmits</a>
 sprkrd: but the tester itself is in Java
 MSmits: I got geppozzed again though =/
 MSmits: and ja fica hurts me  alot
 jacek: some jacek beats you too
 MSmits: yeah, but thats normal :P
 MSmits: I have come to accept this 
 MSmits: anyone who is into boardgames has to, eventually
 Wontonimo: anyway sprkrd, I don't want to oversell brutal tester but I did really find it useful for hyper parameter tuning
 ja_fica: Sorry MSmits
 MSmits: did you improve ja_fica?
 MSmits: or did i just push you a lot?
 ja_fica: I did
 MSmits: oh ok, congrats
 ja_fica: I improve it
 MSmits: gj
 ja_fica: only 50k rollouts thought, thanks
 ja_fica: I can't beat you, Im going to try a CNN approach
 MSmits: well struct showed that rollout count matters, but not by a lot
 MSmits: ja_fica don't take me as a benchmark though. With the opening book I make a poor comparison. Compare with struct instead, he's clean
 ja_fica: My rollouts predict 3 moves ahead using AVX
 jacek: try BBC approach
 MSmits: predict 3 moves?
 ja_fica: BBC is an actual structure or you are just trolling me?
 ja_fica: Yes, with AVX and binary tricks
 MSmits: i wonder if this is the same thing we do ja_fica
 MSmits: we take a random move that is not winning for opponent
 MSmits: i guess thats 1 or 2 moves ahead?
 ja_fica: Computing winning postions can give you 2 moves ahead
 MSmits: and you add another move somehow?
 MSmits: do you still using winning posititions for this? Or something completely different?
 ja_fica: using AVX I can compute 4 wining position at the same time
 MSmits: well we do that too
 MSmits: 4 directions at least
 ja_fica: thats not worth
 ja_fica: I tried
 MSmits: depends on the way you code it, it gave improvements for us
 ja_fica: and get 570k calls in 20ms
 MSmits: struct likely has more rollouts because his avx is even better
 ja_fica: using AVX vs scaler did'nt improve a lot for me, Computing 4 plays at the same time, I can call the function 2.1M times in 20ms
 ja_fica: struct AVX is the same as my old one, at least in time
 struct: ja_fica you had a problem on the benchmark
 ja_fica: *call the function computing 2.1M
 struct: I can call my compute moves over 32M times in 20ms
 ja_fica: let me try mine
 ja_fica: Single AVX version: 586051Multiplay AVX version: 2349656
 MSmits: I get 2.8 million sims now
 MSmits: I forgot to take out some old stuff

 struct: dont do
 struct: while(!stopwatch.timeout)
 MSmits: I hope the compiler is not smart enough to realize that you keep calculating the same thing over and over
 struct: the hotspot will be in there
 MSmits: stopwatch checks are slow
 struct: and also what msmits said
 ja_fica: slower than the function?
 jrke: then how check the time is left or not?
 ja_fica: I don't think so
 struct: slower than some functions yes
 struct: you check the time every N iterations
 MSmits: also, why even check the time more than once
 MSmits: just check how fast you do x iterations
 MSmits: 1 million iterations takes x ms
 MSmits: mmh lucky submit i think. 27 games all wins so far
 MSmits: but the dreaded ja_fica is near
 MSmits: aww first loss at 32, to darkhorse
 MSmits: and another... sheesh
 ja_fica: Im losing xD
 MSmits: it's just low statistics
 MSmits: a 5% perf boos should not matter much&#160;:)
 MSmits: boost
 MSmits: btw

 MSmits: 36 endgame book for oware spits out 14 GB every 2 hrs
 MSmits: 70 iterations like this and i should be done
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: now msmits beats me everytime&#160;:(
 MSmits: honestly, did not change anything except the 5% performance and steal move 1
 MSmits: book is the same
 jacek: 5% eh
 MSmits: yeah i had some stuff in there that i forgot to change when comparing functions with darkhorse
 MSmits: so fixed that
 MSmits: darkhorse64 if you're reading this. it was the reduce_or thingy
 punter147: MSmits wow.
 punter147: i try my best to understand all your comments, but honestly most of it goes over my head :joy: 
 jacek: maybe youre his student :v
 MSmits: well it's very context sensitive
 MSmits: let me know if i need to clarify&#160;:)
 jacek: and im 5th&#160;:(
 MSmits: that's because ja_fica improved
 punter147: Wontonimo i am trying mcts on uttt
 MSmits: that's cool punter147, keep everything simple at first. Mcts is a pain to debug the first time
 MSmits: or did you use it before?
 punter147: No MSmits, i tried on spring challenge 2021, was a failure though. uttt is the first home grown implementation that made it to gold(with many great people's advice here and on the internet)
 jacek: welp spring challenge is simul game, not quite for standard mcts
 MSmits: yeah, you can use it there, but not with a ton of adjustments
 MSmits: without
 MSmits: not a great place to start
 MSmits: uttt is great though, so are some other simple boardgames we have
 punter147: jacek oh, i was also thinking the same, as both players make simultaneous moves. Plus the branching factor was also huge without pruning some actions
 MSmits: yeah, well you can actually just ignore the simultaneous part and just assume your opponent has knowledge of what you do
 MSmits: however much that assumption hurts you is hard to say
 ja_fica: It is definitly better then no MCTS at all
 MSmits: but it's been done a lot
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 ja_fica: jacek, you use CNN or regular NN?
 MSmits: he doesnt use convolution layers
 MSmits: (yet)
 ja_fica: Im creating my own convolutionlayers
 MSmits: cool
 ja_fica: But its hard to make them cache friendly
 MSmits: you mean the weights are all over the place?
 ja_fica: filters-&gt;width-&gt;height
 ja_fica: conv requires 3 dimentions
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: is cache really the main issue though?
 MSmits: seems like a micro-optim issue
 ja_fica: if you compute all filters firsts then you may cache misse the last dimention
 MSmits: yeah that sort of thing does play a role
 ja_fica: It is more then cache as I want to use fma()
 MSmits: whats fma()
 ja_fica: multiply add in AVX
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well this is far outside my experience still
 ja_fica: Well, it seems to be very hard to do this CNN
 ja_fica: the bias kills me xD
 MSmits: might be your perfectionism right now though. Maybe get it working first?
 ja_fica: Yes, but Im only writing the foward pass doe, not the training, as I will train in keras-python
 MSmits: ahh ok, same here
 ja_fica: and te weigths have a bias
 MSmits: unless they don't 
 MSmits: what happens when some layers dont have a bias
 ja_fica: They may overcompensate the missing bias depending on the amuount of values on the previous layer
 MSmits: mmh ok
 ja_fica: *the weigths overcompensate
 MSmits: who knows what's best though. So much crap works that shouldn't and doesn't that should
 MSmits: with nn you just try stuff and learn I think&#160;:)
 ja_fica: I can add a fake bias so I don't have to care about it, I'm just really worried about the training/wigth transfer 
 ja_fica: Well wish me luck
 MSmits: good luck&#160;:)
 jacek: MLP for the win
 ja_fica: thanks :grin:
 jacek: and poor holand vs czech

 struct: yes
 MSmits: oh so we're kicked out of tournament?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: too bad I guess, but things turn back to normal sooner then, which is a plus
 MSmits: I would sooner watch a twitch game match than a soccer match and I'm not watching any twitch games
 MSmits: I like those ones where they test AI
 eulerscheZahl: smits as hyped about the world cup as I am
 Astrobytes: world what?
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a world cup&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: the soccer tzhing
 MSmits: how's that possible euler, you play the game yourself&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i did today again
 Astrobytes: Playing it is better than watching it.
 MSmits: oh, cool
 Astrobytes: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: but playing isn't the same as spectating some millionaires
 Astrobytes: ^
 KP56: how do i put 2 loops inside of a loop in stub generator
 MSmits: I liked playing it back when I was young and my knees were better
 eulerscheZahl: you can't KP56
 Astrobytes: Pro football is a joke. If you want a good match watch amateur/lower  leagues
 MSmits: whats bad about pro football Astrobytes?
 KP56: what do i do then, i cant do n*2 because its apperentely not a number, i cant do 2 loops
 eulerscheZahl: the pandemic really showed it. they live by different standards than the rest of us
 Astrobytes: It's just a money making machine MSmits. No sport involved. Or very little.
 MSmits: well sure, but it being a money making machine doesn't exclude the players trying to win?
 MSmits: what are they doing wrong?
 MSmits: hmm
 Astrobytes: Pay someone enough...
 MSmits: sure, that's not that prevalent I think though. These guys get a large salary as it is
 Astrobytes: Yes. That's what I'm getting at.
 MSmits: it does happen, i think there was some scandal a few years back
 MSmits: hmm still dont see why the game would be bad to watch because of the money involved. I can get it if it's boring in some way
 MSmits: like high end billiards
 jacek: they get much $$$ from leagues. if they are injured during national matches, they lose $$$
 Astrobytes: It IS boring.
 KP56: everyone likes something else
 MSmits: ask jacek what he likes
 Astrobytes: Watch amateur leagues. Far better actual football.
 KP56: i dont watch football at all, but i get it why people do
 Astrobytes: It's very low on my priority list.
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: I only became aware of it because my students opted to make their html/css projects about soccer
 Astrobytes: Grim.
 eulerscheZahl: no UTTT leaderboard project?
 MSmits: nah
 eulerscheZahl: you must be disappointed :P
 MSmits: I remember reading a few hrs ago about this topscorer expected to score a lot during the European Cup and thinking: "Oh is that any time soon"
 MSmits: on one of their sites i am grading
 MSmits: so this was a 3hr rollercoaster for me between learning it's happening and learning we got kicked out
 eulerscheZahl: i always hate that "we" speak
 MSmits: looking back now I did see orange stuff in a lot of places now. Things click
 MSmits: yeah me too actually
 MSmits: it's is always "we won" until it's "they lost"
 Astrobytes: Is this like how Andy Murray is always Scottish when he loses tennis matches and British when he wins?
 eulerscheZahl: "I would sooner watch a twitch game match than a soccer match"found one for you&#160;;)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/Trackmania">https://www.twitch.tv/Trackmania</a>
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, I hear a guy speaking with a German accent
 eulerscheZahl: did you hack my microphone?
 eulerscheZahl: if yes, better tell me now
 MSmits: no it's this twitch guy :P
 MSmits: one of them anyway
 punter147: MSmits :joy: success is a wave, but loss is a particle. 
 eulerscheZahl: in economics it's the opposite
 MSmits: good one punter147
 Astrobytes: Only if you observe it
 eulerscheZahl: manager makes the win, community pays the losses
 eulerscheZahl: i looked it up, the commentator is from Norway
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: *slightly* different accent :D
 punter147: eulerscheZahl right :joy:
 MSmits: ohh
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the other one is German, nvm&#160;:(
 MSmits: haha
 MSmits: yes i did say one of them&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: FailToad
 eulerscheZahl: at least I admit fault
 Astrobytes: True.
 MSmits: a great quality
 MSmits: the more you fail, the greater the quality is
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: if you never fail it's useless
 Astrobytes: That's an unreachable state.
 MSmits: yes, it's hypothetical
 MSmits: but anyways, i prefer my twitch games to be strategy games
 MSmits: or some kind of tactical game
 MSmits: racing is meh
 MSmits: might as well watch formula 1 on tv
 punter147: thanks MSmits, quantum mechanics does apply on macroscopic systems too :joy:
 Astrobytes: Formula snore
 MSmits: If they didnt have helmets you could see those guys think: "Hey, I swear I was just here a few minutes ago"
 Astrobytes: lol
 punter147: Astrobytes what about formula e?
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday i installed flatout 2 again after many years
 eulerscheZahl: even got it working under linux, to my big surprise
 MSmits: whats that? Reminds me of wipeout
 eulerscheZahl: racing game
 Astrobytes: whereas racing on the Nürburgring Nordschleife is exciting
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: but only the cracked version, wine doesn't like the copy protection :D
 Astrobytes: lol punter147
 MSmits: wine?
 MSmits: you need to be drunk for this game?.
 eulerscheZahl: that's how you run windows programs on Linux
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: wine stands for "wine is not an emulator"
 MSmits: learning so much on chat today
 Astrobytes: you really didn't know that MSmits?
 MSmits: not really, vaguely remember 
 MSmits: stuff I dont need to know fades really fast for me
 Astrobytes: yeah fair
 eulerscheZahl: there is a math software "sage". in older versions the windows installer they provided was just a linux virtual machine :rofl:
 KP56: LMAO
 MSmits: thats tricksy
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: never used that one actually, I only used Maxima and Maple
 MSmits: ooh it's getting late. Got 2 more days to fix my backyard before the fence guys come. Time to do some sandsweepin'
 MSmits: ttyl
 Astrobytes: ah, almost done then&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: what I like about sage is that you can code in python
 eulerscheZahl: no weird syntax
 eulerscheZahl: well, mostly python. e.g. ^ is pow instead of xor
 MSmits: ye. Took out some 100kg+ stones these last 2 weeks and chopped tons of tree root
 MSmits: just filling some holes now
 Astrobytes: that's handy euler
 Astrobytes: Nice MSmits
 MSmits: not enough sand, so also digging some holes&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, fun
 MSmits: feels like real useful work
 MSmits: so anyways, off i go to dig one hole and fill another
 Wontonimo: real hands on work.  so few people are willing to do that in my city
 MSmits: ttyl
 Astrobytes: Have fun :D
 Wontonimo: ttyl
 struct: cya
 eulerscheZahl: colleague of mine wanted to build a house, arsene in the ground makes it much more expensive
 eulerscheZahl: spell check tells me that "arsene" is wrong but doesn't offer a correction
 struct: whats arsene?
 Astrobytes: Arsene? Wenger?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: i tried google.  no luck
 Astrobytes: arsenic I presume
 eulerscheZahl: Arsenic
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: is there a command to put the table back, or do people just copy-paste it from elsewhere?
 struct:  /flip
 Astrobytes: no /unflip
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: just flip it twice
 eulerscheZahl: and then there is /slap &lt;name&gt;
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: no flipping twice&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: but I like the idea
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I almost forgot: pinging BlaiseEbuth for no particular reason but to prove a point
 Astrobytes: Which point?
 eulerscheZahl: that random pings can be annoying
 BlaiseEbuth: You'll prove nothing eulerscheZahl. But :wave:
 Astrobytes: ah. 
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: why eulerscheZahl
 KP56: is random pinging allowed?
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 Wontonimo: Yes
 KP56: @jacek @Astrobytes @BlaiseEbuth @eulerscheZahl @Wontomino
 Wontonimo: how's it going KP&gt;
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 KP56: solving problems
 BlaiseEbuth: Gonna kick you
 KP56: the current one im working on is the "Winamax Sponsored Contest"
 KP56: @BlaiseEbuth wait
 KP56: @BlaiseEbuth you will regret it trust me
 Wontonimo: he's kidding
 Wontonimo: (i hope)
 KP56: @BlaiseEbuth @Wontomino ok
 KP56: @BlaiseEbuth @Wontomino how is it going
 Wontonimo: you don't need to put the "@" infront of names
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 BlaiseEbuth: Not me
 Wontonimo: a little late Astrobytes, but I approve the like
 struct: was just a kick
 struct: he will be fine
 Wontonimo: why kick him?
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah why&#160;?
 struct: ok
 KP56: cuz i was spamming pings for no reason
 KP56: @Wontomino
 Astrobytes: :D
 KP56: @BlaiseEbuth
 KP56: ok i need to stop
 KP56: and focus
 Astrobytes: I would advise that :P
 Wontonimo: thaxs
 Wontonimo: you need a picture now that you are in the top 5,000
 Wontonimo: it's a rule
 KP56: is it?
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 Wontonimo: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: JBM still have no pic...*
 Astrobytes: listen to Squiddy v2.0 here :D
 Wontonimo: it's my rule, Blaise can say what he wants
 BlaiseEbuth: I can ban you and your rules
 Wontonimo: you can ban me, but now my rules!
 Wontonimo: *not
 KP56: done
 Wontonimo: oh man, my comebacks would be so much better if I proof read 
 <b>**struct bans Wontonimo</b></p><p><img src="/a/66558167826970" /> TeachMeSenpai: o.o
 KP56: a
 <b>**Astrobytes bans His Rules</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: Nooooooooo oooooh
 BlaiseEbuth: Astroban
 KP56: his rules are always going to live inside of our hearts
 Wontonimo: you are a monster!
 Astrobytes: Ban'o'bytes
 BlaiseEbuth: Irish he
 Astrobytes: Aye 
 Astrobytes: Aul Ban'o'Bytes o' aul Dublin Town they call me
 KP56: there is way too many BFS related problems on this website
 KP56: and graph theory overall
 Astrobytes: There are a lot, it's true. Plenty other stuff to dig into though.
 jacek: maybe try some graph theory games
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: it's as if graph theory is useful for solver a wide range of computing problems
 Wontonimo: nah, couldn't be
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jacek: to be frank at work i never used explicitly graph related stuff
 Wontonimo: oh wait, I'm banned.  how am I writing this
 KP56: i think its because of most problems being actually bot coding for small games
 struct: shadow banned
 Astrobytes: virtual ban&#160;;)
 struct: only you and mods can see your messages
 KP56: thats not true
 KP56: i can see them
 KP56: wait nvm
 struct: you are also banned
 KP56: i cant see them
 Wontonimo: good, that's pretty much the only people I talk to here anyway
 Astrobytes: :D
 zsltg: shadow mod?
 Astrobytes: shady mod
 Wontonimo: Nice apple KP.  I approve the random pic
 KP56: i feel like everyone here just googled some random word, downloaded the picture and then uploaded it
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 Astrobytes: Are they Gala apples?
 KP56: idk
 Wontonimo: Maybe royal gala
 KP56: its just some random picture i downloaded from google images
 Astrobytes: Hm yeah, possible.
 Astrobytes: Put some thought into your picture next time KP56 :P
 KP56: i just wanted to follow the rules
 KP56: i am a good person
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: lol
 Astrobytes: oh new multi in WIP
 KP56: really?
 BlaiseEbuth: No gui. Bad one
 eulerscheZahl: it has a gui?!
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of a game that was a contest at my university
 eulerscheZahl: there you accumulated some energy each turn
 Astrobytes: Still need to do my 9 mens morris bot. WTF is that fencing game the new TvC or what
 eulerscheZahl: and you could use it to shoot, move and/or use your radar
 jacek: hmm many poles in this new game's leaderboard :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: you were blind without radar. so you had to find and track your opponent
 Astrobytes: Sounds like robot wars/robocode
 Astrobytes: UoW jacek
 KP56: are you talking about WIP: Space Shooter?
 eulerscheZahl: lots of python on the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Yeah KP56
 jacek: eeyup
 eulerscheZahl: btw what happened to the tank battle game?
 Astrobytes: Not sure. Was hoping it would come back. I think he said he was pushed for time but plans to bring it back at some point iirc.
 Astrobytes: *would have come back by now
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile that person avatar on blue background is really active with clashes
 eulerscheZahl: in terms of quantity

 eulerscheZahl: did you bookmark it?
 Westicles: No, it was in old chat
 eulerscheZahl: i think he even linked it on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, bed time.every day i have to send my boss an email that i'm working from home (traceability in case of covid infection). tomorrow will be #250 :tada: 
 Astrobytes: congrats... I think :D
 Astrobytes: and goodnight
 punter147: congrats eulerscheZahl. good night. 
 punter147: on my path to exile my STL objects and welcome primitive ones, i noticed that bitset is 3x slower on average than uint16_t
 Astrobytes: with the pragmas? I've never benchmarked the two
 Astrobytes: *two of them
 punter147: no without the pragmas.
 Astrobytes: Benchmark with the pragmas then
 Astrobytes: And compare
 Astrobytes: If it's negligible and bitset is your preference then...
 punter147: okay let me do that
 KP56: why doesn't solving puzzles count toward CP
 Astrobytes: XP only. No idea why. Just whatever CG decided.
 Astrobytes: but CP is variable too, so... puzzles don't really factor into that very well
 Astrobytes: As in you can be +/- CP from day to day
 Astrobytes: Position in multis, CoC, whatever
 KP56: that's true
 KP56: you are probably right
 punter147: Astrobytes its a small improvement. But uint16_t is still around 3x faster than bitset on average. i test on 1e5 calls of find_possible_actions, the most costly operation in my Node code rn and measure the time taken.
 Astrobytes: punter147 then it's a no-brainer&#160;;)
 punter147: Astrobytes why? did i test it wrong? i am a noob at stress testing.
 Astrobytes: No, I mean the decision to use uint16_t over bitset doesn't require much thought given your results&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: no-brainer = no thinking required (my bad, probably a UK expression)
 punter147: oh ok :smile: but i guess phasing out maps and vectors will give significant improvements.
 Astrobytes: If you're not changing the size dynamically you'll be fine with std containers for the most part.
 Astrobytes: so reserve is your friend there
 punter147: no worries, my english still requires lot of work. but i learnt a new expression :smile:. oh i see, thanks for the advice Astrobytes, will try to check whether this happens in my code.
 Astrobytes: Your english is very good punter147, don't worry&#160;:)Yeah, it can definitely help on CG.
 punter147: thanks Astrobytes :smile: I will keep this in mind.
 Astrobytes: No problem&#160;:)
 Op_King: Hi
 Wontonimo: Hey punter147, nice Ultimate Tic Tac Toe bot!
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes, what do you mean "reserve is your friend"?
 darkhorse64: he means that reserve allows to preallocate data for your vector, essentially making it a pool for your nodes while retaining the nice features, size(), push_back(), back()
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 habatu: hello&#160;:)
 fzort: how do I even increase my XP? been joining a lot of clashes but I'm stuck at 20 XP
 struct: clashes do not give experience
 struct: only puzzles and multiplayers
 fzort: oh bummer
 fzort: thanks
 AymanS15: hi
 Wontonimo: hey fzort, also your CP will not go above 5000 just doing Clash of Code.  you have to do other competitions like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a> Coders Strikes Back and Connect 4
 fzort: @Wontonimo thanks
 ZeroSugar: :grinning:
 punter147: Thanks Wontonimo. Although i still have a lot to learn from yall :grin:

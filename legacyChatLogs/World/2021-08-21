 TobiasA: has anyone reached gold with flat MC in uttt so I can know what is possible and what isn't 
 martinpapa69: why would you do mc in uttt :thinking:
 TobiasA: :scream:
 martinpapa69: mc is not 1v1 friendly
 TobiasA: I wasted my time
 martinpapa69: not rly you have a sim i guess
 martinpapa69: so you can build an mcts around it
 TobiasA: if it isn't 1v1 friendly then where is it used mostly?
 martinpapa69: 1 vs env
 TobiasA: got it thanks
 eulerscheZahl: "has anyone reached gold with flat MC in uttt "yes, I did
 eulerscheZahl: then MCTS for legend
 xpman: hi
 TobiasA: :0
 TobiasA: hi xpman
 TobiasA: how did you do it eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: for each first move:
 eulerscheZahl: repeat as long as there is time
 eulerscheZahl: take the first move that gives the most wins
 eulerscheZahl: won't get you into legend but good enough to destroy silver
 TobiasA: i did that too but it only got me too 1st in silver but still below the bos:disappointed_relieved:
 TobiasA: *boss
 eulerscheZahl: then you need more sims
 TobiasA: how do i get more sims?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know your current amount
 eulerscheZahl: how many rollouts at the start of the game? (at 90ms)
 TobiasA: dunno:sweat_smile:
 TobiasA: lemme check
 TobiasA: do you mean the number of steps to get to a terminal node or number of times that process was performed?
 eulerscheZahl: the latter
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just put up this number: 5k full rollouts at turn 1 (90ms) with MC will get you to gold easily
 TobiasA: 4293
 TobiasA: that's what i'm getting
 eulerscheZahl: sounds good enough
 martinpapa69: fix your sim
 TobiasA: it works fine though
 TobiasA: guess i have no choice but to use MCTS but the thing is if MCTS gets me to gold but not legend i won't know what else to do
 martinpapa69: building an mcts on a buggy code doesnt sound like a good idea
 TobiasA: if only i knew what the problem was

 TimothyAlexisVass: Hey guys, how is it possible to have played over 100,000 clashes or even played over 100,000 clashes and have a Score around 10-12?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Are there bots in the Clashes?&#160;:\
 sarabelforte: i dont kow
 jacek: TobiasA you can make sims more smart. i.e. make moves that win small board more probable
 TimothyAlexisVass: Just read about it and yes, there are bots..."This account is a CodinGame bot for Clash of Code.
 TobiasA: that was what got me from second to first in silver 
 ProCoder03: I did a Flat MC which performed well in Wood, but when I just simply added the code for 3x3 small boards , I am only in top 100s 
 TobiasA: but wontonimo said&#160;% is very slow
 ProCoder03: is it a problem with my sims&#160;??
 TobiasA: and i have a lot of&#160;%:sweat_smile:
 ProCoder03: what do you mean by '%'&#160;??
 Netsos: cal
 TobiasA: modulus
 TobiasA: top 100 of what league?
 ProCoder03: bronze
 ProCoder03: I tried  MCTS now 
 ProCoder03: top 1000
 TobiasA: bruh
 TobiasA: that's scary
 ProCoder03: the prob is my MCTS does some invalid moves 
 TobiasA: i guess the problem is from your sim
 ProCoder03: yeah ik, I just can't find it 
 ProCoder03: it seems there is a prob with my Main board class , urgghhh
 TobiasA: i feel your struggles
 TobiasA: good luck on finding the problem
 ProCoder03: performance wise , MCTS is good, I usually get around 4000 rollouts for 1st move with flat MC but i can go up to 8000 rollouts in MCTS 
 ProCoder03: Thanks :smiley:
 TobiasA: time to go modulus hunting:muscle:
 TimothyAlexisVass: Have you learned anything yet sara?
 Wontonimo: modulus is very slow compared to addition, bit it isn't so bad as to avoid it at all cost.  If it makes sense to use it and changing it out for something else doesn't improve sims/turn, use modulus
 Wontonimo: if you need to do x%9, do it.  if you need to do x%16, try instead x&amp;0b1111
 ja_fica: you can avoid using muduls
 ja_fica: *modulus
 ja_fica: in every number
 Wontonimo: example of modulus 9 plz
 ja_fica: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aipuzzles.com/learn/performance">https://aipuzzles.com/learn/performance</a>
 ja_fica: random generator section
 ja_fica: using shifts
 ja_fica: you can go ahead and implement it in your algorithms, thank me later
 jacek: considering number generation is your bottleneck
 Wontonimo: that's good for rand
 ja_fica: ((number &gt;&gt; 16) * mod) &gt;&gt; 16
 ja_fica: using uint32_t
 Wontonimo: yeah, i know that trick
 ja_fica: it works as long as the number is smaller than 2^16
 ja_fica: you can do in 64 bits
 ja_fica: ((number &gt;&gt; 32) * mod) &gt;&gt; 32
 ja_fica: using uint64_t
 Wontonimo: sure, but it doesn't do 32%9
 ja_fica: sure it does
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 ja_fica: ((32 &gt;&gt; 16) * mod) &gt;&gt; 16
 ja_fica: ((32 &gt;&gt; 16) * 9) &gt;&gt; 16
 ja_fica: never tried it
 ja_fica: you are rigths, im such a noob
 ja_fica: *right
 Wontonimo: i really like the random number use that you pointed out.  i only learnt that trick recently
 Wontonimo: it makes total sense
 ja_fica: modulus cant be avoided
 ja_fica: it can but will be less efficient
 TobiasA: Hi wontonimo
 Wontonimo: :wave: hey hey

 Maxim251: there is 7 bits
 BlaiseEbuth: *that
 Kepe55: Why
 Kepe55: I like python
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 Kepe55: So does anyone know what the problem is in my solution?
 BlaiseEbuth: Maxim251 know.
 BlaiseEbuth: But you don't listen to him...&#160;:(
 Kepe55: That was for me?
 Kepe55: Wdym with there is 7 bits
 BlaiseEbuth: rtfm was also a valid answer though...
 BlaiseEbuth: "The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)"
 Kepe55: If you print it out though it is a normal string holding a message, not ascii
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: Sorry.
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you know what ASCII is?
 BlaiseEbuth: (Please don't tell drawing with chars)
 Kepe55: Seems like I don't I thought ASCII is the numerical representation of a number, bytes("h", "ascii")[0] would print out 104 for example
 Kepe55: of a string*
 BlaiseEbuth: of a char*
 Kepe55: yh
 Kepe55: What they provide isn't a number tho
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact it is, since the string is composed of chars, that are stored as numbers. -&gt; Their ASCII representation
 Kepe55: Oh, so it's basically saying that the characters in the message are convertable to ascii
 Kepe55: That's what I did though in my code
 Kepe55: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/53256509-f098-499f-832e-c090732dcedc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/53256509-f098-499f-832e-c090732dcedc</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Right. But the number you get is encoded on 8 bits.
 BlaiseEbuth: And the puzzle use 7 bits numbers.
 TimothyAlexisVass: OK Some of the clashes weren't finished, now it registered.
 BlaiseEbuth: So that probably cause problems when you count 0 and 1

 Wontonimo: Kepe55, are you still looking for help with chuck norris?
 Kepe55: Yep&#160;:/
 Kepe55: I don't get what's wrong
 Kepe55: why it works for single letter strings but not for multiletter ones
 Kepe55: Blaise said something about 8 and 7 bit ascii, but i dont get how I should turn 8 bit ascii into 7 bit
 Wontonimo: i'm looking at your code
 Kepe55: thank you!
 Wontonimo: i'd have one function that converts a 7bit number to binary text, so 3 becomes 0000111
 Wontonimo: one way of doing that would be&#160;: f"{number:#09b}"[2:]
 Wontonimo: i'm substituting that in for your getBinaryFromNumber function
 Kepe55: wdym? Doesn't my getBinaryFromNumber function do that?
 Wontonimo: no
 Kepe55: oh
 Wontonimo: your function returns 11
 Wontonimo: as a number, not a string
 Wontonimo: it needs the leading zeros
 Kepe55: and by converting it to an int those zeros get lost?
 Kepe55: So if I stop turning it into an int it would work?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: you have a function getNumberFromString which i think your intention is to concat all the numbers
 Wontonimo: but i'd recommend concat'ing all the binary strings like '0000111' and then the next one etc
 Wontonimo: getNumberFromString simply becomes
 Wontonimo: return "".join( [ getBinaryFromNumber( ord( c ) ) for c in string ] )
 Wontonimo: getBinaryFromNumber(ord('h')) --&gt; '1101000'getBinaryFromNumber(ord('i')) --&gt; '1101001'
 Wontonimo: getNumberFromString("hi")  --&gt;  '11010001101001'
 Wontonimo: and the end of your program is simplygotBinary = getNumberFromString(message)print(encode(gotBinary))
 Kepe55: Wait so I would turn my getNumberFromString into def getNumberFromString(string):

 Kepe55: Thank you so much
 Wontonimo: no prob
 Wontonimo: i'd like to suggest adding little micro tests for each function, like the assert I shared

 Maxim251: Omy god, I use first time iterator in codingame :D I never used before, i dont have reason to do that, even, I try not use it. But In that situation what I have now, I see that is easier delete position in array in this same loop.
 Maxim251: I hope if in for loop if I delete position in vector, still for loop will iterate to next position as usual
 Maxim251: and... Bad idea, Iterator works, but my logic is bad... oh. 
 jacek: umm dont delete using iterators
 jacek: at least, try to do it smartly
 Maxim251: problem is that Robot need remember turn in new direction, but when he again go to that place, then is destroyed... Problem is that I know how mapped that place, but I dont know how delete robot when he get to that place.
 Maxim251: Happly deleting position using iterator works beatifully, but my logic is bad..

 VicHofs: Automaton2000 help me please
 Automaton2000: it depends on the game
 VicHofs: It's the Spring Challenge can you handle it? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: something to do with the way i have it
 VicHofs: ...
 VicHofs: yes?
 SemChumboPT: Inky timed out&#160;?!
 VicHofs: yeah it happens sometimes
 cegprakash: [CG]Thibaud I shared the company leaderboard in our official slack group that we are the only company from India in top 100
 cegprakash: [CG]Thibaud they all got crazy
 cegprakash: [CG]Thibaud and appreciated us
 VicHofs: guys can anyone explain this
 VicHofs: I tried to time my code because I was timing out right
 cegprakash: and?
 VicHofs: but apparently I'm taking over 100ms sometimes on my turns and not timing out at all
 VicHofs: whereas sometimes I time out with a little bit over 50ms
 VicHofs: my theory is that it sometimes considers the extra speed rounds but I'm not so sure; gotta run more tests
 cegprakash: start ur timer after u read all the inputs
 cegprakash: and stop ur timer before u print all the inputs
 cegprakash: that should give u accurate timings
 cegprakash: ignore the time for IO because IO is usually 0.000001 ms
 VicHofs: after reading the inputs?
 cegprakash: yes
 VicHofs: doesn't the time while inputs are being read count though?
 VicHofs: I put my time() after reading the input for the map, which happens before the start of the game
 thethiny: nah
 thethiny: I put my time() before the input
 thethiny: and it says 80ms
 VicHofs: what the heck
 VicHofs: then something's definitely wrong here lmao
 thethiny: I think the timer starts after you read the input
 thethiny: in that case you can just hack it and do everything before you read
 cegprakash: hey
 cegprakash: CG isn't stupid
 VicHofs: sup fam
 VicHofs: yeah I think it's unlikely too
 cegprakash: usually IO takes like 0.00001 ms
 cegprakash: I'm sure they have some timeframe before which u have to read inputs quickly
 cegprakash: if so I'll just add a Thread.sleep(1000) between reading every row
 Icebox: IO does not take 10 nanoseconds, that's for sure
 VicHofs: lol
 cegprakash: I mean 0.00001 seconds
 ZarthaxX: nice maths ceg
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Icebox: quickmaffs
 VicHofs: 2 + 2 = 4
 VicHofs: - 1
 VicHofs: das 3
 Icebox: QUICC MAFFS
 VicHofs: everyday mans on the block
 jrke: hey we use list.append(3,4) in python what is func in c++ is called
 thethiny: vector
 VicHofs: how dare you
 thethiny: vector&lt;int&gt; myVector;myVector.push(int(3));
 thethiny: smoke trees
 thethiny: using SOLID Principles has solved way too may bugs in my code
 jrke: whats push back func in c++ for BFS
 VicHofs: thanks @thethiny
 cegprakash: u mean pushing in a queue jrke?
 cegprakash: u need to use queue&lt;int&gt; Q; and use Q.push(x);
 cegprakash: if u are using vector jrke u need to use push_back(x)
 cegprakash: vec.push_back(x)
 jrke: but it just push one int
 jrke: i have to q.push(4,5)
 TheManeatingFirefighter_41e2: Hi all, o
 cegprakash: u can use a pair jrke
 cegprakash: or a point class
 cegprakash: if u have a Point class like class Point{
 cegprakash: then u can do q.push(p)
 cegprakash: if u are okay with pair
 cegprakash: use pair&lt;int, int&gt; p;
 cegprakash: and do q.push(p)
 jrke: K
 jrke: thanks
 thethiny: @VicHofs lol thx for what
 thethiny: guys when I'm using BFS, should I check the nearest point every turn, or should I do that once and just move until I reach it?
 VicHofs: cooperating
 VicHofs: snike trees
 VicHofs: *smoke
 VicHofs: gee
 VicHofs: I'm slow today
 fasil: heheee
 thethiny: haha
 VicHofs: see your girl in the park
 VicHofs: that girl is an uckers
 VicHofs: when the ting went quack quack quack
 VicHofs: u man were ducking
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463321749">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463321749</a> Omg Kovi turn 28
 cegprakash: no wonder he is #1
 VicHofs: what happened there'=
 VicHofs: did your pac move back and forth?
 cegprakash: he did not go to his closest pellet
 cegprakash: instead he was chasing me
 cegprakash: only pros know when to chase and when not to chase
 cegprakash: I am no pro
 VicHofs: oh ok
 VicHofs: cause I have the chase function too
 VicHofs: but it's an all or nothing thing lol
 eulerscheZahl: ceg i think he just wanted to look around the corner
 eulerscheZahl: and your noobie but accidentally collided
 cegprakash: he doesn't do future prediction?
 cegprakash: coming up is definitely a bad move
 cegprakash: if he has a sim
 NapTown: his message changed when it saw you
 <b>**DeWill slaps NapTown around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/43602422982101" /> NapTown: and again when you died
 kovi: yes, its not pure luck
 VicHofs: what the heck
 VicHofs: DeWill&#160;??
 DeWill: sorry just trying something new NapTown...&#160;:)
 NapTown: :D
 NapTown: it felt great
 cegprakash: what is DS and what is ST :O
 cegprakash: kovi using cheat codes
 eulerscheZahl: but ceg did a really dumb move here. i don't think that he assumes a dumb opponent in his prediction. would waste too many turns against good players
 shashwat986: The collision seems accidental, but I'm not sure about looking around the corner either. Because there are definitely no pellets there, based on an opponent coming from there
 shashwat986: I've understood DS to mean double-speed? Not sure what ST is
 eulerscheZahl: true. no idea what he was thinking
 thethiny: DS is Depth Search probably
 thethiny: ST = Set Trap?
 eulerscheZahl: or maybe it's random letters to confuse us :D
 NapTown: that it is not
 cegprakash: I don't track opponent positions yet eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: may be that's the diff between top 20 vs rest
 kovi: sometimes my trueskill got lowered with a win vs. lowbie, is that normal?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: it's designed for real players. and the system assumes that you are at least that good
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible that you got worse but still beat the noob
 eulerscheZahl: it's even part of the FAQ of the trueskill site
 Durkin: ah shoot, finally got my collision pathing fixed but still 19 from gold, just gotta' squeeze that last bit out of this man
 jdsfklsd: Yo so what's this about a spring challenge?
 Durkin: competitive pacman AIs xD it's a lot of fun-<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463245297">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463245297</a>
 thethiny: guys my BFS distance from point A to point B is not the same as from B to A
 thethiny: what did I do wrong
 NapTown: how far off are they
 thethiny: I'll send replay
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463327353">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463327353</a>
 thethiny: 😭
 thethiny: frames 40+
 thethiny: infinite loop
 thethiny: maybe I should swap Flood Fill with shortest distance?
 Ltrltrltr1234: Are yall good at clash of code? Can someone challenge me?
 Ltrltrltr1234: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12202802c06c7ea76c4cb0043fd3bdf1c716185">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12202802c06c7ea76c4cb0043fd3bdf1c716185</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can challenge us by playing the contest
 thethiny: hahaha
 Dav1dS: @thethiny are the numbers in brackets the bfs from a to b and bfs dist from b to a?
 thethiny: what do you mean
 nguyenchithanh: elca
 eulerscheZahl: it's his location
 Dav1dS: oh lol
 JohnCM: @thethiny
 JohnCM: did you forget to add to the visited nodes list?
 thethiny: From (19, 9) To (6, 1) Distance 114From (6, 1) To (19, 9) Distance 117
 JohnCM: if a node is visited, you shouldn't expand it out in the bfs loop
 thethiny: I have a visited list and it's working fine
 thethiny: that's what I don't get
 JohnCM: hmm..
 JohnCM: perhaps your bfs takes into account other pacs as well inside the calculation?
 JohnCM: and sometimes there is a collision in one direction vs no collision in the other?
 thethiny: I didn't add collision detection yet
 NapTown: print the path and see what's happening
 thethiny: I'm doing flood, so it's not one path
 aCat: yeah clashes...
 thethiny: I'll print the grid that it generates
 JohnCM: hmm you should just print the path based on parent of the node
 AndroidGoku: Bring it on&#160;!!
 aCat: soryy - I was writing to some older history chat showed me
 JohnCM: for each node, store the parent which is the previous node
 JohnCM: then you can backtrack the entire path
 JohnCM: it works even if you're doing flood fill as you can backtrack
 thethiny: I don't think I'm following
 thethiny: I understood that you want me to check once I reach the path who are the parents
 thethiny: and make a path from them
 thethiny: right?
 JohnCM: ya
 JohnCM: means like from maybe node 3 to node 6 the path is
 thethiny: I will see, thanks
 JohnCM: 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6
 JohnCM: then you should print the path from 6 to 3 also
 JohnCM: 6 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3
 JohnCM: if there's any discrepancy, we then know what is wrong with the bfs
 JohnCM: perhaps your bfs is not handling a roundabout correctly etc.
 JohnCM: roundabout as in a passageway which loops
 thethiny: 6  5  34  -1 12  1  0
 thethiny: this is the grid
 thethiny: it shows 0, 1, 3
 thethiny: which is wrong distance calculation
 JohnCM: what is the left side?
 JohnCM: 6 5 etc.
 thethiny: I'm testing it on a 3x3 grid
 thethiny: and this is what it prints
 thethiny: the distance calculation is wrong
 thethiny: it should be
 thethiny: 4 3 23 -1 12 1 0
 JohnCM: hmm i am not sure what is the 3x3 grid calculating
 JohnCM: ah.. the centre is a wall is it
 thethiny: yes 
 JohnCM: and you start from bottom right and count to top left
 thethiny: yes
 JohnCM: i got your problem
 wi_lius: how do you calculate the distance for a cell? `parentDistance + 1`?
 JohnCM: you didn't store a node.cost in your node
 JohnCM: and when you expand that node, the next node's cost is node.cost+1
 JohnCM: don't use a global cost incrementer
 thethiny: oh no I didn't
 thethiny: I used global distance variable
 JohnCM: must add one cost for each node you expand based on the previous node's cost
 thethiny: thinking of it, I don't have F = G + H
 JohnCM: ya just implement a node.cost variable for each node and you'll be fine
 thethiny: so I will have to make a Point object, thanks
 JohnCM: then when you hit your desired node.. then break the loop to avoid calculating everything
 JohnCM: this is called "early stopping"
 JohnCM: saves lots of time
 thethiny: I'm trying to calculate everything in frame 0
 thethiny: so that I don't calculate it next turns
 thethiny: Thanks JohnCM, I will add nost cost
 thethiny: node*
 JohnCM: np
 JohnCM: haha anyway i've run out of ideas to implement
 JohnCM: now it is just finetuning my model by adjusting parameters
 thethiny: good luck!
 JohnCM: but haha the top 100 ppl are really hard to win
 TrueBlur: How do you get harder questions on clash of code?
 JohnCM: i optimize to some, i lose to the rest
 thethiny: Let's hope for the best
 JohnCM: are you in silve now thethiny?
 JohnCM: oh haha nvm abt that qn
 JohnCM: all the best for the coding
 thethiny: I didn't submit anything for 5 days now&#160;:(
 thethiny: at least I'm learning new things
 thethiny: which is good
 thethiny: From (19, 9) To (6, 1) Distance 122From (6, 1) To (19, 9) Distance 122
 thethiny: :D
 thethiny: no it didn't work well
 thethiny: 9 7 45 -1 23 1 0
 thethiny: but how is it the same distance I don't understand
 Doju: heyy everybody
 BenWo: heya Doju
 CoolGlitch: guys I think there a problem, most of the times when I read the pacs they feed me, some times they give an opponent pac but the mine flag is True, and they don't give me pas that faces is
 jjdb210: You sure you aren't sharing ids? enemy's and good's have have the same id which can cause problems.
 CoolGlitch: is it supposed to work like that?
 Doju: how do you guys handle smarter pathfinding so you don't collide?
 jjdb210: The data they are sending is almost certainly correct (or all of our bots wouldn't be working and you'd see more people mentioning it)... Odds are it's something with how you are parsing the data in.
 BenWo: yeah, it's an ID per player
 BenWo: I don't care for it either
 Doju: i have an idea what i should do about it but no idea where to put that idea
 Doju: pac class? universe class? maybe even grid??
 BenWo: all my pathfinding stuff is currently in the Pac class
 BenWo: but it's due for an overhaul
 Doju: Huh.
 BenWo: think I might create a "Brain" class
 wi_lius: you need a God object
 Doju: ohhh
 thethiny: I FIXED MY BUG UGH 
 thethiny: I was updating the function BFS
 Doju: so that all pacs belong to the god?
 thethiny: but I was calling DFS
 thethiny: UGHHHHHHHH
 Doju: lol
 Doju: well
 thethiny: at least it works now
 Doju: at least it's fixed now :P
 thethiny: finally
 thethiny: I can beat Inky
 wi_lius: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object</a>
 thethiny: technically I can't cuz idk how to move 2 everytime with speed
 JohnCM: all the best thethiny
 thethiny: thank you JohnCM so much for the help
 JohnCM: @thethiny, that is easy to do
 JohnCM: instead of returning the node.parent, return the node.parent.parent
 JohnCM: if it is None, then return node.parent
 thethiny: hmmm
 JohnCM: basically, return 2 searches from your pac position
 JohnCM: not one
 thethiny: okay 2 searches will work
 thethiny: thanks!
 thethiny: I'll search for 2 if it works, else 1
 JohnCM: ya
 JohnCM: or if you find it difficult to do so
 JohnCM: just ask the pac to go to the end goal
 JohnCM: don't need to care about the intermediate step
 thethiny: my problem is when I'm next to a surrounded block
 JohnCM: i think you should be able to get to silver even without intermediate pathfinding
 Doju: hm, isn't a god object.. a bad thing?wi_lius
 BenWo: lol according to that wikipedia link it's not great
 JohnCM: hm what do you mean by surrounded block?
 thethiny: example, if I'm at 21, 9 and I need to go 21, 10<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463339201">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463339201</a>
 NapTown: it will still go there, you'll just have to stop on the speed round before coming back
 JohnCM: yea for speed wise
 JohnCM: you can't do double step in and out
 JohnCM: which is a real constraint
 NapTown: because you can't change destination
 JohnCM: well sometimes i pass by an alley full of pellets, but because it is not in my speed turn, i don't see it
 wi_lius: @Doju in real world software engineering - yes. When you need to hack something together that works, might as well skip all the concers where to put what and have everything in a single place
 JohnCM: they really should let you see all the pellets your pac passes by
 JohnCM: my algo will improve tremendously with that
 Doju: wi_lius that's a solid argument. I'll consider just shoving everything in the same thing if i don't find any better solution soon
 Doju: thanks
 Doju: JohnCM you don't?
 Doju: whatt
 NapTown: JohnCM that's part of the challenge but yeah it would be easier
 Doju: so if you speed through an intersection you don't get info on it
 wi_lius: @Doju that's what I do with Scala: a few data classes and one more class with all the methods
 NapTown: if it's the speed round you get no input, hence no info
 Doju: wi_lius okay, sound reasonable
 JohnCM: ya i was watching a replay of mine against kovi
 JohnCM: i lost by 1 pellet
 Doju: right, NapTown.
 JohnCM: and that was the reason
 JohnCM: haha
 JohnCM: now we're talking about 1-2 pellet difference for the bots to determine victory
 BenWo: time to explore new strategies
 Zandy156: I feel like I'm just telling my bot what not to do and hoping it understands and stops doing it.
 NapTown: i thought about syncing the speeders with the intersections but haven't gotten to it, and won't
 Doju: NapTown that's basically the idea that i'm gonna try to do
 JohnCM: well there's one suggestion i have for a mediocre bot
 JohnCM: eat whatever pellets you see next to you, until unable to. then go back to spreading yourself out
 JohnCM: but haha it is still an art to decide which pellets lead to higher returns in the long run
 NapTown: a good starting point
 Doju: ah this is so wonderful
 Doju: instead of adding actual tuples to my pos his
 Doju: i can now just throw the cells themselves there
 Doju: and it'll just work &lt;3
 NapTown: nice
 BenWo: that sounds lovely&#160;:)
 thibpat: Hi :wave: It's :sparkles: Spring Challenge time :sparkles: with a focus on better pathfinding in JavaScript <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 JohnCM: nice one thibpat
 JohnCM: do you do regular streams of this?
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: he keeps doing this every few days
 anid: Any idea who the silver boss is?
 thethiny: it's me!
 NapTown: Clyde

 351062: kovi&#160;: do you use a fancy enemy tracking with some kind of brute-force or some basic floodfill stuff&#160;?
 kovi: multiple heuristic
 Neumann: would you classify those as "brute-force"&#160;? :D
 kovi: nope
 Neumann: dayum
 JohnCM: should be something based on countdown and speed if i may guess
 JohnCM: i have been trapped at the start of the game before after transforming
 JohnCM: haha.. it is not bad
 solaimanope: why does so many top contestants use C++?
 aCat: because its fast
 lifetimeLearner007: yeah, I've that question too
 solaimanope: Currently Top 10 has 9 C++ users
 aCat: and they have high-level proficiency in it
 lifetimeLearner007: either top contestants use c++  or only c++ users get to be in top 10... which one is it?
 Durkin: Doesn't hurt that you've got a lota' colleges that teach that as the primary starter language either
 solaimanope: I am better at C++ than Java. But I don't have the confidence to manage a code this big in C++. 
 NapTown: probably the top contestants choose a fast language
 JohnCM: oh shouldn't it be the case you should use the langauge that you are confident in
 MattSOrme: watching kovis bot is like watching a master class in what i want mine to do
 lifetimeLearner007: but the speed of cpp makes a difference in top leagues i think
 solaimanope: Kovi are you doing some sort of simulation?
 lifetimeLearner007: monte carlo maybe?
 kovi: not real one, just many partial heuristics
 kovi: no monte carlo (yet)
 Neumann: :o
 solaimanope: I am struggling in defense.
 eulerscheZahl: i did not expect that answer
 lifetimeLearner007: :no_mouth:
 jrke: hey anybody knows how to return two or more variables from function in c++?
 solaimanope: use tuple and tie()
 kovi: its easy to see that im fully deterministic
 Neumann: return an array, a vector, or a custom class
 jrke: K can i return pair
 lifetimeLearner007: or u can pass an mutable argument
 eulerscheZahl: i'm deterministic too. yet i have a search
 kovi: oh, i said you surprised on no monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: being deterministic just simplifies debugging
 eulerscheZahl: surprised on no search
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have monte carlo either
 eulerscheZahl: discarded the idea
 kovi: i didnt say i have no search, i said i have no full simu
 lifetimeLearner007: there's the catch
 eulerscheZahl: ok. i don't have that either, regarding collisions
 TrentT: Wow finally rank 1 in bronze
 TrentT: Too many dumb assumptions
 lifetimeLearner007: well done TrentT
 solaimanope: I still haven't got out of the BFS that I wrote on day 1. I wanted to do some simulation, but the time limit may not allow it.
 ashikujjaman: can I play my bot with diffrent levels bot?
 lifetimeLearner007: that's why they have time limit for each turn
 Icebox: Anyone has gotten brutaltester to work for this contest?
 WINWINWIN: @Icebox what does the brutaltester do?
 Icebox: It tests 
 Icebox: quite brutaly too
 solaimanope: brutaltester needs a referee right?
 Icebox: it's a tool for playing games offline
 Icebox: yeah solaimanope
 solaimanope: has anyone made the referee yet?

 MSmits: seems like it matters a lot who submits
 JohnCM: haha euler keeps trapping my pieces
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure you deserved it
 MSmits: euler is a killer bot and pulls me down
 eulerscheZahl: for not being careful
 MSmits: my bot is stupid when it comes to trapping and being trapped
 eulerscheZahl: for being trapped i agree
 MSmits: how so
 JohnCM: haha but i am winning in cases when you trap and miss the super pellets
 MSmits: it doesnt trap anyone
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463356697">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463356697</a>frame 38...
 JohnCM: so you gotta watch out for those cases
 kovi: same here. i have no self tracking
 eulerscheZahl: i escape and then return to the danger
 MSmits: I fixed that for my bot
 MSmits: its the one thing on my bot that was easy
 MSmits: on my list
 MSmits: just look back 1 turn see if somethign was there
 eulerscheZahl: i prefer generic solutions
 MSmits: sure me too, but it's not always possible for this contest
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 MSmits: if you floodfill the opponent from the moment he disappears, your pac will freeze
 kovi: yep, its much shorter than ooc
 MSmits: he wont be able to go anywhere
 MSmits: so i look 1 turn back. 2 might be worth it
 dbdr: here is a bug I need to fix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/KEOfVw.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/KEOfVw.jpg</a>
 solaimanope: dbdr how did you test?
 dbdr: it's a unit test
 Tiramon: kill_eueler is a nice testcase
 kovi: maybe its just flaky
 solaimanope: are you testing it locally?
 lifetimeLearner007: kovi, being the top guy, how much time per day are you spending for this contest? I'm curious to know.
 dbdr: yes, solaimanope
 kovi: too much...not always actively, but starting new test or submit
 solaimanope: Is there any feature in CG to filter out games which have failed and caused a timeout?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 solaimanope: It would have been helpful if they added it.
 Doju: solaimanope that'd be superr handy
 kovi: use euler tooling
 eulerscheZahl: i found no timeout in 121 matches for you solaimanope
 kovi: or ask him&#160;:)
 solaimanope: thanks euler
 eulerscheZahl: ocean of code was fun regarding timeouts

 cegprakash: I won't succeed? eulerscheZahl? I'm already on gold
 cegprakash: and my best rank was 110
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you call that success?
 eulerscheZahl: but admittedly better than your usual struggle with the lower bosses
 Icebox: xD
 Doju: lol
 TinfoilSaint: sik
 cegprakash:&#160;:'(
 cegprakash: roasted
 [CG]Thibaud: you have a brother eulerscheZahl&#160;: daiver19
 eulerscheZahl: i know. he's doing well on topcoder

 eulerscheZahl: i know ceg, this submit is broken&#160;:(
 cegprakash: u always timeout against me
 eulerscheZahl: was an infinite loop in my new feature
 eulerscheZahl: tested one match. and it was that one "lucky" game where it didn't fail
 cegprakash: I want to find the intersection of two points given that the distance between two points is 2
 Rprades: does anyone know how many usually are promoted to legend? is it around 10-20, or more around 50? it is my first "serious" contest here, so thinking about it!
 Quidome: The last time it was 10
 alexandreb09: Hu guys, does anyone can help me with Winamax Sponsored Contest puzzle&#160;?
 cegprakash: it could be x1,y2 or x2,y1 or (x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2
 cegprakash: anything else I'm missing
 Quidome: eventually ended up around 70 players in legend 
 Durkin: God i'm so confused- must have added something stupidly tiny but important 3 hours ago, because reverting promoted me from 170 to Gold, and I cant find what changed for the life of me
 Rprades: Thanks Quidome
 solaimanope: Quidome around how many games are played in legend league for ranking?
 Quidome: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 jrke: hey whats wrong in these two lines c++
 solaimanope: I couldn't qualify for legend league in my last participation. I was frustrated from all those traps.
 Quidome: legend is tough
 Quidome: never been there&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: only twice, im bad&#160;:/
 fasil: y u here
 Quidome: cegprakash if it is distance 2, it can be around the corner...
 Quidome: so you could end up with .5 in x or y direction
 perseverent: how do I know one of may pac has died
 Doju: perseverent if it's not visible it's dead
 cegprakash: perseverent u don't get in input
 Doju: and in silver and above you also get dead pacs in input
 Quidome: Your pac is no longer on the list or hast status DEAD
 AntiSquid: lol feels like a CSB rule
 Quidome: Don't know which one actually, because i filter the dead
 perseverent: I am sure I receive ifo about the dead one
 perseverent: info
 perseverent: funny
 perseverent: maybe a bug
 Quidome: OK than type is DEAD
 AntiSquid: because you are in silver .
 Quidome: Only in silver and up BTW
 perseverent: oh
 perseverent: I see
 perseverent: thanks
 perseverent: is is in the rules?
 Quidome: yes
 sgalasso: Hello everyone, is there 12 996 players or 4452 on the challenge I don't get it&#160;?
 perseverent: typeId
 Quidome: 4452 submitted
 perseverent: I missed that
 perseverent: OK
 perseverent: thanks
 sgalasso: Oh ok tks
 Quidome: still an awfull lot&#160;:)
 sgalasso: Yes yes ^^'
 Quidome: cegprakash you there?
 Tiramon: almost 13k registered and around 4.5k submitted a bot sgalasso
 cegprakash: yes Quidome
 Quidome: solved your middle problem?
 Quidome: I am needing that too&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I don't want middle I want intersection of two points :D
 cegprakash: so I was trying 3 intersections
 Quidome: What do you mean by intersection of 2 points?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52737673-bd3a-4bf9-a71a-5a79b8d1dd47">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52737673-bd3a-4bf9-a71a-5a79b8d1dd47</a>
 cegprakash: there are 3 possible intersections for A and B
 Quidome: I got invalid paste on that
 cegprakash: A#
 cegprakash: and
 cegprakash: A
 Quidome: yes, exactly
 cegprakash: anything more?
 cegprakash: or just 3
 cegprakash: x1, y2x2, y1mid point
 cegprakash: I tried these 3
 Quidome: well the horizontal one, but that's sort off the same
 Quidome: and btw, one of the two diagonal ones is alway a wall
 Quidome: funny was looking at this also&#160;:)
 Quidome: But we sorted it out\
 Quidome: thnxs
 cegprakash: cool
 Quidome: you don.t need the divide in the diagonal case
 Quidome: (x1, y2), and (x2, y1) will do
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: do u precompute these
 Quidome: no
 cegprakash: or calculate dynamically
 krawacik3: Anyone considered min-max algorithm?
 Quidome: i use min_max on one move
 eulerscheZahl: too high branching i think
 Quidome: with a lot of pruning
 Quidome: and grouping
 Quidome: was a lot work
 AntiSquid: contest got very difficult, hard to move forward
 Quidome: what's your position?
 eulerscheZahl: then turn around and collect the pellets in a different row
 krawacik3: I mean, its really high complexity, but maybe someone uses it for at least 4-5 generations
 AntiSquid: somewhere 80 to 100 Quidome&#160;?
 Quidome: oh, yes, I am struggling to get into gold :D
 Xoangur: ): I'm struggling to get into silver
 JohnCM: actually i removed one modification
 JohnCM: lol
 AntiSquid: i am struggling to get top 50&#160;:(
 Quidome: JohnCM :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: again
 JohnCM: counter-meta, works well against euler's bot
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: ah you caught euler in a bad spot on the leaderboard
 jdsfklsd: bruh i suck at c++ for these challenges
 jdsfklsd: if i have to convert a string to int that's a wrap for me
 AntiSquid: oh so Neumann did join afterall
 Neumann: o/
 eulerscheZahl: and with his main account now
 AntiSquid: how high was your alt before you joined?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, this submit is running good...or lucky?
 JohnCM: i guess lucky
 Neumann: I was 30 on my alt
 Tiramon: great last ideas i have to improve are all hard one ... increase performance of search, predict pellets eaten by opponent ...
 eulerscheZahl: what is your alt?
 ShannonNorris97: Do any of the high level bot programmers on Codingame have Youtube Channels? I'd be curious to see what their code looks like across the various competitions/competitive modes. It's probably not in their best interest because of potential code copying, but I thought it was worth asking
 JohnCM: oh i'm talking abt my submit, not neumann
 Neumann: My alt shall remain secret
 AntiSquid: obv hard to tell if lucky or not, i don't know if my current submit is an improvement or pure luck&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i want to know whom i don't have to fear anymore
 AntiSquid: you're at 2 euler
 Neumann: Don't worry it sleeps in the bottom half of silver league
 eulerscheZahl: as i said: submit doing well so far
 eulerscheZahl: or lucky?
 eulerscheZahl: but i improved the bot, not just resubmitting
 AntiSquid: thought you talk about john since he replied
 eulerscheZahl: no. i do it like others and just talk about myself
 Neumann: Feel free to talk about your enemy tracking
 JohnCM: wow euler
 Neumann: i'm struggling on that
 JohnCM: i wanna see how well mine does against your new bot now
 eulerscheZahl: same
 eulerscheZahl: tracking is a pain
 AntiSquid: is enemy tracking required for top 30-50 or what
 JohnCM: next up i'm gonna implement some trapping already XD
 JohnCM: payback time
 Neumann: Maybe I also should code a proper search instead of a naive depth 1 heuristic
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl nearly 1st?
 eulerscheZahl: finally something seems to be working \o/
 JohnCM: depth 1 heuristic can't go far
 eulerscheZahl: i can smell legend league already
 AntiSquid: magically got into top 50 
 JohnCM:&#160;:) i knew it euler, always had faith in your bot
 Tiramon:  grats AntiSquid&#160;;)
 JohnCM: i've been training against yours since day 1
 AntiSquid: thx but it's not enough
 Ramzel: What is the Memory limit?
 eulerscheZahl: 768MB
 AntiSquid: i still have two major bugs in my bot which i am aware of, so does that mean everyone around my rank has some ridiculous bugs in their bots?
 Ramzel: U mean euler walk in dfs tree or euler cycle? :D
 JohnCM: i think by sat/sun most bugs will be gone
 AntiSquid: you'd think so
 lifetimeLearner007: what is depth1 heuristic?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463410075">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463410075</a> frame 16 omg kovi
 Tiramon: damn gold has so close matches ... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463365572">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463365572</a>
 AntiSquid: just plan 1 turn ahead lifetimeLearner007
 eulerscheZahl: ceg that frame 16 isn't even that brilliant. you could just move instead of SPEED
 eulerscheZahl: then you win the row of pellets
 Tiramon: what depth are you guys using currently?
 lifetimeLearner007: thanks AntiSquid. But then how does planning few moves ahead help? we don't know what commands the opponent is gonna make right?
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl meant about my death
 AntiSquid: indeed Tiramon lots of losses are just by 1-5 points diff
 eulerscheZahl: i think the smartest move is to just keep bumping
 eulerscheZahl: me too. he converted to scissors and you lost
 cegprakash: yes but why did he switch
 AntiSquid: i call mine depth 0, no depth guaranteed Tiramon
 cegprakash: how did he know I was a paper
 cegprakash: I was in the fog
 llllllllll: you bumped
 eulerscheZahl: you colldided
 cegprakash: oh damn
 cegprakash: so what do I do?
 cegprakash: u said smartest move is bumping
 cegprakash: but I lost there
 eulerscheZahl: you keep moving and don't speed
 AntiSquid: everyone top gold does the switch i think ceg
 Tiramon: keep the cooldown for a switch when bumping
 eulerscheZahl: then you reach the collision cell 1 turn earlier
 eulerscheZahl: so he can't kill you
 WINWINWIN: Well done cegprakash
 Csipcsirip: I don't switch yet at all
 eulerscheZahl: i only do when it's a 100% kill
 eulerscheZahl: if you see me switching without killing, it's a bug atm
 Ramzel: What is bumping
 llllllllll: collision
 Tiramon: 2 pacs collide and stay where they were
 Ramzel: Ok thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i like the word bump
 JohnCM: lots of losses are 1-5 points difference unless you get eaten up by euler
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, thiny differences in harvesting are quite important
 eulerscheZahl: coordinating your pacmen and guessing where the opponent has been
 JohnCM: wow i never thought i would see this day of top 50
 eulerscheZahl: yet you are top40 even
 JohnCM: haha i feel satisfied alr abt the progress in this comp. legend or not. this is a personal accomplishment
 JohnCM: how?? this small tweak is so good?
 JohnCM: it improved 100+ places
 eulerscheZahl: you are doing well for your first contest
 JohnCM: thanks
 [CG]Thibaud: true
 JohnCM: hope to code something in C++ next time for monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: i remember my first: was doing well to a certain point. then i just dropped and couldn't improve no matter what i was trying
 JohnCM: thanks thibaud
 Ramzel: Guys, do u know sth about neural networks in this game?
 Ramzel: It should be the best.
 Ramzel: Does anyone do sth like that?
 JohnCM: don't think it works cause of variable size boards and pacs
 eulerscheZahl: too complicated and high uncertainty of what's going on
 JohnCM: unless... you train the neural networks for all maps
 JohnCM: which is a hell of a task
 eulerscheZahl: there are some games where a neural network is dominating, e.g. coders strike back
 JohnCM: i guess being symmetrical it reduces the board possibilities
 JohnCM: but still there are so many
 JohnCM: i would think GA would be a better bet
 JohnCM: you control how risk taking each PAC is
 Ramzel: Yeah but as input to nn u can just put the close location of each pac
 Tiramon: Oh i guess a NN would work, but you have to trains it alot, also you would have to give all weights to the CG IDE, and the ide has a size limit for codecan remember someone complaing that his weights were to much&#160;;)
 cegprakash: 4% caliberated to #46 adding that anti bump
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl
 JohnCM: well technically you could hard code your weights in as a hexadecimal string
 Tiramon: even then you will need more than 10 weights ... 
 Tiramon: and each weight will a few characters
 Tiramon: *will need
 JohnCM: well last i checked the most complex neural networks need about 1 million weights
 JohnCM: now maybe more
 JohnCM: so 1 million * double memory space (64 bits)
 JohnCM: maybe 64 million bits
 eulerscheZahl: hexadecimal? how inefficient :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article#passing-the-100ko-code-size-limit">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article#passing-the-100ko-code-size-limit</a>
 JohnCM: wow base 85 nice
 Tiramon: last size limit i know is at 100k
 eulerscheZahl: and the limit is 100k chars, not bytes. so some use fancy unicode
 hearthewarsong: How are the final result calculated? If I get into legend ( probably I wont), do I only play against other legends players? For example if I end up with 2 ai. One with 40% winrate against top players, and 99% agaist weaker, and an other with 45% vs top players and 90% vs weaker players, which one is better at the end of the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: trueskill ranking matters (you can google that)
 Tiramon: for multiplayer scores the 'True Skill' algorithm of Microsoft is used <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bit.ly/TrueSkill">http://bit.ly/TrueSkill</a>
 eulerscheZahl: to stabilize and counter lucky submits
 Tiramon: and yes if you are in a league, you only play against players that are also in that league
 eulerscheZahl: and for gold and below it's just finished pending submits and calling that the final leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: you can still promote after the contest ends and get more battles in the higher league
 Ramzel: visited[u.x+vx[g]][u.y+vy[g]]=true, from[x][y][u.x+vx[g]][u.y+vy[g]]=u, cost[x][y][u.x+vx[g]][u.y+vy[g]]=cost[u.x][u.y]+1, q.push({u.x+vx[g], u.y+vy[g]});
 Ramzel: need to Find bug in this spagetti
 AntiSquid: ramzel you could use the maximum possible board size as input but then you have a lot of empty cells ... maybe you'd have to look into convolutional neural networks and it gets complicated and it's a lot of work, but yes sure possible if you spend time on just doing that, but no idea how you upload your bot to CG afterwards
 Ramzel: Thanks for so much feedback. But I was only asking. I dont have anough time to write nn
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: no ambition Ramzel
 Ramzel: ;c
 Tiramon: oh and about your line of ...what about making more than one line out of that?
 Clagus: it's impossible to tell, which way an enemy pac has gone right? and also when it's using Speed, he can rush in front of you, cross your view, and didn't get noticed right?
 Ramzel: I did it :D
 Tiramon: even saving vy[g] into a seperate var should make it easier readable
 Tiramon: Clagus you know where he is able to got and when you see one of those locations and he is not there you can reduce the amount of locations where he can be
 Tiramon: but yes if you don't see an enemy pac for some time the locations grow exponentially
 Clagus: I just wish we had the info about which direction the enemy pac did take when he was dissapearing from my view
 Tiramon: you could also reduce this amount if you see a pellet is still in place where you expected him to walk by
 Tiramon: so many possibilities and only 50ms time&#160;;)
 Clagus: yeah&#160;;(
 Clagus: and I code in c#...
 Tiramon: the language is only relevant when you know how to right hight performant code in that language imho
 Clagus: true
 Tiramon: i guess my java code is more performant than when i 'try' to write that code in c# or c++
 Illedan: And C# is fast enough if the algorithm is right.
 Clagus: especially after newest changes in c#, it can be used quite efficiently, but I'm not that skilled :P
 Clagus: yet!
 Clagus: :D

 cegprakash: 3 kills all chases
 cegprakash: looks all planned
 WINWINWIN: Nicely done Wala!
 Ramzel: What league is it?
 Doju: woah wala, that first kill from behind the corner
 Doju: :ooo
 Tiramon: yes crossing are quite dangerous
 thethiny: you just got unlocky @ceg
 Doju: wait not first kill lol
 Doju: third
 thethiny: he never saw you once
 thethiny: unless he calculated based on his own pacs
 Doju: what on earth
 thethiny: which is very smart
 Doju: that's amazing
 Clagus: first kill seems lucky
 cegprakash: first kill I agree
 thethiny: here on the other hand, my pacs decide to riot and change their paths on their own
 Doju: maybe even the first one was planned
 cegprakash: 2nd and 3rd kills are master planned
 Clagus: second one too :P
 Ramzel: Can i see the compile comand?
 Doju: red pac 0 did see blue pac 1
 eulerscheZahl: how is any of this planned?
 Ramzel: for c++
 Doju: oh hold on nevermind
 eulerscheZahl: i see one player collecting and another one walking into
 Doju: i'm dumb
 Tiramon: Ramzel? you mean the parameters like mentioned here&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Doju: technically you could predict that the leftmost pac goes for the super pellet
 cegprakash: 3rd kill eulerscheZahl
 Doju: and there are only 2 possible paths left
 Doju: but the 3rd kill was super neat anyways
 Ramzel: Yes thanks 
 eulerscheZahl: he keeps going in that direction after the kill
 eulerscheZahl: so probably just wanted to go there
 Ramzel: I was wondering if falg O3 is used
 eulerscheZahl: you code is compiled without any optimizations
 eulerscheZahl: you can use pragmas to speed it up a little
 Ramzel: Lets check if pragmas are allowed
 eulerscheZahl: they are
 Doju: umh
 eulerscheZahl: (this information is C/C++ specific)
 Tiramon: if i play against him i don't see any masterfully planned kills
 Doju: i'm trying to store different moving methods in a dict. those methods aren't static so they require an instance. Can i make the dictionary a class variable or do i seriously need to store it in the instance?
 Doju: seems silly to store it in the instance since
 Clagus: Tiramon but that could be highly map dependant, or just lucky as hell, because it that replay he would kill all 4 of them if not scissors block on frame 20
 Doju: but the methods require an instance
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.studytonight.com/python/python-static-keyword">https://www.studytonight.com/python/python-static-keyword</a> Doju

 thethiny: at all
 Doju: yeah i'm doing that but since the methods that but since i call the instance methods from the class variable it doesn't work
 Doju: so i need staticmethods?
 Doju:&#160;:/
 WINWINWIN: Doju, ig you dont pass self to the method it becomes static
 Tiramon: if that wre planed kills it must be a really lucky game for himi didn't have any game like that against him, and i started a few by now
 eulerscheZahl: and he would be ranked much higher if it was planned
 Clagus: Tiramon - ok, I guess it could be just map shape that did all of this...
 Tiramon: he even missed some good chances to kill my bots if he was planing it
 Tiramon: played the same seed against him
 Tiramon: was a draw 
 eulerscheZahl: case closed
 Tiramon: and only kill was one of his pacs died
 dbdr: a broken clock is correct twice a day
 thethiny: true
 Tiramon: depends on how you break it&#160;;)
 Doju: :D
 Clagus: :D
 dbdr: :D
 Doju: :D
 dbdr: sometimes even 3 times a day
 eulerscheZahl: leap hour?
 dbdr: I doon't think there is such a thing :D
 thethiny: During summe
 dbdr: only leap seconds
 thethiny: summer time
 Doju: i mean leap seconds work too
 thethiny: when u move the clock back 1 hour
 dbdr: right
 eulerscheZahl: daylight saving time, that's what I meant...
 thethiny: Riddle me this:
 thethiny: A guy was driving his car, and he saw 3 doors in front of him. Red, blue, and green/ Which door should he open first?
 <b>**dbdr knew, just teasing</b></p><p><img src="/a/43888825213429" /> AntiSquid: then just display a random time, 60 tries / minute, chances are much higher
 fasil: corridoor
 thethiny: :D
 dbdr: thetiny the best one
 Doju: monte carlo it
 thethiny: the car door :D
 eulerscheZahl: always switch doors, learned it from monty hall
 dbdr: can I make up the rules now eulerscheZahl? :D
 eulerscheZahl: wow, dropped again quickly. i guess i was just lucky&#160;:(
 cegprakash: #69 I like my rank
 dbdr: switching doors is obviously the best strategy: you can look what's behind while switching them
 WINWINWIN: #800&#160;:(
 cegprakash: helps me be in the mood
 Quidome: cegprakash I also like you rank&#160;:)
 uvBoss: im stuck in bronze
 uvBoss: :sob::sob::sob::sob::sob:
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, only 1 point between 11 and 3..In that window it's just about luck and latest submits :P
 cegprakash: uvBoss I reached gold with just going to closest PAC
 uvBoss: wat????
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 WINWINWIN: closest PAC using a BFS?
 cegprakash: yes
 uvBoss: closest PAC?
 WINWINWIN: and cooperation?
 cegprakash: yes cooperation
 cegprakash: but cooperation was needed to get from silver to gold
 cegprakash: didn't have that till silver
 uvBoss: sigh
 cegprakash: bronze to silver was pellet tracking
 cegprakash: I'm in top 30
 cegprakash: will I get my first T shirt?
 WINWINWIN: T-shirt?
 jrke: last pellet race
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463451607">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463451607</a>
 WINWINWIN: there are T-shirt prizes?
 eulerscheZahl: usually there are. this time nope
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah, it doesn't say anything about T Shirts in the prizes
 eulerscheZahl: top20 usually
 jrke: there is curved monitor for first ranker
 offroff: why can I see dead pacs? Is that useful for anything?
 eulerscheZahl: tracking
 cegprakash: I don't use it yet offroff but I think top 10 use it in gold
 offroff: hmm, alright, I guess maybe it make sense, otherwise you don't really know if an enemy died?
 WINWINWIN: Congrats ValGrowth!
 cegprakash: offroff thats right
 cegprakash: because of accidents
 offroff: yeah, and in some situations the enemy hides behind a corner and you won't know
 offroff: didn't realize that&#160;:)
 MattSOrme: If you don't code in c++ you aint getting a prize haha
 MattSOrme: 8/10 top 10 are c++ other 2 are c#
 Ramzel: Is it bcs of c++ speed?
 MattSOrme: yh
 MattSOrme: Should also give prizes to top for each language. Would encourage more languages
 eulerscheZahl: in the past it was like that
 offroff: would also encourage even more laziness from me
 eulerscheZahl: tshirt for top50 + first per languageyears ago...
 offroff: I use javascript, too lazy to learn anything else
 MattSOrme: CG getting cheap on us?
 eulerscheZahl: some abused the system: promote to legend, submit crashing bot in obscure language
 MattSOrme: Only 1 person using Objective-C and they're in 84th
 eulerscheZahl: there are 4 D players now :o
 MattSOrme: someone called atra is in gold, but his bot just sits still... is that a way of stopping other players from testing against him properly?
 Uljahn: :scream_cat:
 MattSOrme: AtrA*
 JohnCM: maybe he submitted a buggy code accidentally
 JohnCM: it'll be fixed by sunday probably
 JohnCM: just take it as a free win
 Uljahn: could be bot hiding :smirk:
 AntiSquid: ya obv bot hiding
 AntiSquid: but if your bot isn't top 10 material, what's the point?
 cegprakash: I just added something nice.. hopefully top 20.. I'll take a break and come back tonight.. have to do office work :D
 AntiSquid: you really did improve ceg
 AntiSquid: but not top 20 lol
 cegprakash: hey it's only 27% AntiSquid
 MattSOrme: Maybe he is top 10...
 MattSOrme: Hi ranked codingame player for sure
 MattSOrme: high*
 Tiramon: 48% and 29 ... don't think he reaches top20
 AntiSquid: his rank fluctuates
 AntiSquid: could reach top 10 if he gets lucky
 AntiSquid: not enough luck ceg
 AntiSquid: accidentally wrecked ceg now
 JohnCM: wow amazing kovi has been dethroned
 Doju: wow, that val guy is winning like every game
 cegprakash: I rekt him on IDE
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/valgrowth?lang=en">https://twitter.com/valgrowth?lang=en</a>that level of confidence :D
 eulerscheZahl: I want to know if it's luck or if the change is working, so I'd like to bring it up, but I don't want to lose my current ranking, so I'm conflicted.
 lifetimeLearner007: well done cegprakash, ur score seems to be increasing. u might actually end up in top 20
 cegprakash: what language is it eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: japanese
 cegprakash: ty lifetimeLearner007
 eulerscheZahl: and english from a machine translation
 cegprakash: translator is confused
 cegprakash: can't read
 cegprakash: it took it for french

 cegprakash: I had to choose Japanese manually
 eulerscheZahl: he would like to resubmit to see if it was luck but not lose the #1 spot for trying
 Doju: cegprakash same
 eulerscheZahl: so he just assumes #1 is justified
 cegprakash: what's there to lose
 Clagus: :D
 cegprakash: 4 days left
 cegprakash: If I'm #1 I would hide my bot
 eulerscheZahl: the japanese users are an active community. sadly staying in their language
 Doju: i dont get this&#160;:(
 Doju: i'm defining some methods as a class attribute
 Doju: and trying to call them from the instance using this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19075843/dispatch-a-class-method">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19075843/dispatch-a-class-method</a>

 Doju: (methods in a dict, btw)
 Doju: but it's just throwing an error when i define the dict
 Doju: oh now it almost worked
 Doju: nvm then
 dbdr: &gt; I tried implementing red and black trees in Ruby&gt; Conclusion&gt; I implemented it.
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: translation might make it funnier than it is
 Doju: :D
 Doju: no he just snaps his fingers and it's done :D
 eulerscheZahl: they even have their own search algos that get rarely mentioned here on chat. such as chokudai search
 Zenoscave: what is chokudai
 eulerscheZahl: read the blogs
 Zenoscave: beam search related?
 kovi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chokudai.hatenablog.com/">http://chokudai.hatenablog.com/</a>
 kovi: he is the strongest (if we consider topcoder open finals)
 tsukammo: yes, beamsearch variants.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ykawano.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/06/26/002228">http://ykawano.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/06/26/002228</a>
 BenWo: ugh, submitting
 wlesavo: so chokudai search is kind of meme like smitsimax?
 AntiSquid: no ooc PM on kawano's blog
 Thiesjoo: What is smitsimax?
 AntiSquid: some reinvented algo by msmistz
 AntiSquid: solaimanop and jolindien, same avatar and almost same rank, different language though, coincidence? AutomatonNN
 Psyho: wata is way stronger than chokudai
 AntiSquid: well same character, no same avatar
 WINWINWIN: I dont get it, why does cegprakash`s rank go till top 50 and suddenly come down to last in gold?
 JohnCM: that happens when you resubmit
 Doju: WINWINWIN maybe he introduced a bug
 RockyMullet: lucky first games probably
 cegprakash: because every submission is independent
 JohnCM: if you roll 10 wins in first 10 games, your rank skyrockets very high
 kovi: you must be right psyho
 JohnCM: especially if you score a lucky win against the top 10
 AntiSquid: because he didn't fixt'd his bugs WINWINWIN, and where is your avatar?
 WINWINWIN: Thanks, L) AntiSquid will add an avatar now
 kovi: neither active lately though
 WINWINWIN: Got an avatar now
 kovi: nice to see you back (and here) btw psyho. can we expect a last hour win submit?
 WINWINWIN: why doesnt it show up AntiSquid?
 wlesavo: refresh
 Psyho: haha, probably not
 WINWINWIN: tried refreshing twice
 Psyho: I'm struggling&#160;:)
 Psyho: just started writing something non-trivial but I had a 2+ years break from coding + I don't have too much experience with those kinds of contests
 kovi: unlike with halite...you are on pair with recurse
 eulerscheZahl: 2 years away, wins topcoder...
 eulerscheZahl: by a huge margin
 kovi: and that
 Psyho: that topcoder win was very lucky - it was more like a puzzle that you had to solve
 Psyho: and somehow people didn't do that and rushed to implement anything that works
 eulerscheZahl: i liked the puzzle
 Psyho: halite had a ton of depth and I'm usually good with problems/tasks that are incredibly complex
 Psyho: but I have never really done a proper 2-player game where you can't ignore enemy moves
 kovi: +fog of war. so it is complexeven though ooc seemed better
 JohnCM: what's ooc by the way?
 AntiSquid: ocean of code
 AntiSquid: previous contest
 JohnCM: i see..
 AntiSquid: but imo this is less random
 JohnCM: oh this is quite random indeed
 JohnCM: random start points, random maps
 Psyho: actually fog of war makes it more single player imho
 AntiSquid: but it's symmetrical start, you know the initial state
 AntiSquid: in ooc you didn't know the initial state
 Psyho: i.e. more heuristic-based than chess-like
 JohnCM: true
 JohnCM: unless you can simulate the entire state 200 moves later
 JohnCM: you have to rely on heuristics
 JohnCM: if not can monte carlo through, with maybe a billion simulations
 JohnCM: even a billion may be too little
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463503473">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463503473</a> turn 12 I show mercy
 Doju: JohnCM you need a quantum computer :d
 JohnCM: or you need good state value approximations
 AntiSquid: i like this more than ocean of code and unleash the geek combined, despite all of them having hidden info
 JohnCM: cut off the search at a certain depth
 kovi: true. i like heuristics. im not that good in finetuning a single algo
 JohnCM: my algo has at least 10 heuristics
 JohnCM: i finetune them against the top 10
 AntiSquid: there got to be a perfect search for the top spot
 JohnCM: but it doesn't work against the top 100. quite different playstyle
 JohnCM: so it is a balance
 JohnCM: kovi, can i ask roughly what is the win rate like to be #1 in leaderboard
 cegprakash: just 60% against #2 is enough JohnCM
 JohnCM: but you don't really fight with #2 much, you fight with the rest usually
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/valgrowth">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/valgrowth</a>
 AntiSquid: JohnCM
 AntiSquid: looks like on recalc it's close tiberiu and kovi atm
 AntiSquid: ah nvm
 AntiSquid: kovi has bigger win rate vs val
 AntiSquid: 88% win rate vs val @_@
 JohnCM: how do you see win rate?
 AntiSquid: click on their names
 AntiSquid: it brings you to their stats
 WINWINWIN: Really nice tool cgstats, who made it?
 AntiSquid: some rock paper scissors effect at the top 
 AntiSquid: magus did WINWINWIN
 JohnCM: wow yup
 drykberg: some matches mine and the enemies pacs dont move, is this a known bug or something?
 Tiramon: do you have a replay drykberg?
 wlesavo: you probably timing out
 cegprakash: drykberg those are speed turns I guess
 Tiramon: that is what i guess ceg
 drykberg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463518069">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463518069</a>

 Tiramon: oh no it is just you output only one command per turn
 drykberg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463517210">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463517210</a>
 Tiramon: so only one command is handled
 drykberg: but it cant be ^^
 Tiramon: in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463518069">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463518069</a> you send first turn 'MOVE 0 1 1|' so only pac id 0 is moved
 drykberg: ive tried this almost 100 times on pinky this morning
 drykberg: i saw that, but why it cant be ^^
 Tiramon: that must be in your code 
 Tiramon: hard to tell you were it happens without knowing your code&#160;;)
 drykberg: happened 5 times in last 25 matches i think
 Tiramon: propably an if that is triggered in special situations
 Tiramon: for details i would need your code
 drykberg: actually it happened every match
 drykberg: sometimes mine sometimes opponents
 drykberg: could it be because i put code before the game while loop?
 dbdr: OK, I found my algo's name, now I can start implementing my bot
 Tiramon: depends what code you put there
 Tiramon: as i said without code i can just guess
 drykberg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f63a5f5-1900-4625-beb3-a487f0e2cfdb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f63a5f5-1900-4625-beb3-a487f0e2cfdb</a>
 Tiramon: that expired ...
 drykberg: how to post code without it saying expired ^^
 Tiramon: normaly it should work like this
 R1FA: someone had the same pb, he was using '\n' between each commands

 Tiramon: [CG]Maxime pastebin seems to be broken, it is always expired
 Tiramon: send it to me per private msg
 Tiramon: there no pastebin is created
 drykberg: i have only 1 \n at the very end
 drykberg: it all works normally, as expected vs pinky
 drykberg: well, before the game loop i have 6 arrays each of size 201 initialized with null

 TheSugarCoatedTaxidermist_3da7: Hello everyone,
 goore: hi
 TheSugarCoatedTaxidermist_3da7: i want working on a Leap motion project
 TheSugarCoatedTaxidermist_3da7: i have keyboard and i want to click them thru leapmotion
 Tiramon: drykberg, yes looks fine there ... but without code ...
 Tiramon: leap is still alive?
 TheSugarCoatedTaxidermist_3da7: but when i implement the leap motion code it appears under the keyboard and i cant access the keyboard with leap
 TheSugarCoatedTaxidermist_3da7: yeah xDdo you prefer another sensor&#160;?
 Tiramon: no just havn't heard of leap for a long time 
 drykberg: its 400 lines of wannabe programmer trash, you dont want to see it ^^
 TheSugarCoatedTaxidermist_3da7: EXACTLYYY 
 drykberg: i dont even know how to use a 2d array
 drykberg: or pointers
 Tiramon: but without i can't tell you why it sometimes works and sometimes does not ...
 TheSugarCoatedTaxidermist_3da7: like i was trying to understand the cope so i can create the keyboard using js and implement leap with
 drykberg: it wud be awesome if u took a look, but dont know how to paste it here as pastebin seems to be broken as of right now
 Tiramon: sry never worked with leap, just was fascinated when they published it =(
 Tiramon: use an external pastebin or post it in that private talk i just started with you
 drykberg: how about this: 5 minutes ago i submitted code and was placed #36 in wood 1, now i re-submitted to see if that error comes up again and im placed #257 in wood 1?
 Tiramon: if it sometimes only gives one command and sometimes for all .. that sounds as expected
 drykberg: how do you get ranked though? because i did win more than i guess 75% of the matchups
 Tiramon: for multiplayer scores the 'True Skill' algorithm of Microsoft is used <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bit.ly/TrueSkill">http://bit.ly/TrueSkill</a>
 drykberg: so it doesnt matter if you win?
 [CG]Maxime: if you win against someone you're expected to win, your score is not changed as much as winning against someone better than you
 drykberg: ok read it, got it thanks
 drykberg: this time i got placed #76
 eulerscheZahl: Tiramon that's you change to report the broken pastebin
 eulerscheZahl: oh i guess he's here because of your ping :thinking:
 Tiramon: hope so =)
 Adnmaster: i cant find an invalid syntax here: elif(ability_cooldowns[a]==0 and distanceTo(d, d2, pac_x[a], pac_y[a])&gt;10): can someone help me?
 Adnmaster: note: distanceTo is a function that i made
 eulerscheZahl: test:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c4785647-e662-4011-9a8a-66195b5270d4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c4785647-e662-4011-9a8a-66195b5270d4</a>

 H1ggsb0s0n: does anybody know how the promotion to legend is done&#160;? Is there another bot we'll have to defeat&#160;?Where can I find more information about the schedule and the promotion rules&#160;?
 AntiSquid: just like before H1ggsb0s0n
 AntiSquid: top 15 or top 10 automatically promoted, rest need to beat up the boss
 Tiramon: yes H1ggsb0s0n
 Doju: Adnmaster i can't really find anything there
 Doju: except maybe you need a space after elif? not sure
 Tiramon: they will choose a bot from the ranking and then they will add it as boss
 AntiSquid: also tomorrow 18:00 CET is legend release H1ggsb0s0n
 Adnmaster: thanks Doju
 H1ggsb0s0n: Thank you for the info, AntiSquid and Tiramon!
 Doju: Though i have a suspicion that you forgot to close some parentheses
 Adnmaster: hmm...
 Doju: above that line
 Adnmaster: can be
 Adnmaster: i sent it to a syntax checker it said no error
 Adnmaster: but codingame says error
 Doju: is distanceTo a method or a function?
 Adnmaster: function i think, i use def to make it
 Doju: if it's a method it has to be instance.distanceTo
 Doju: is it in a class?
 Adnmaster: no
 Doju: ok
 Doju: hmm
 Adnmaster: i used: def distanceTo(here variables):
 Doju: yeah ok
 Adnmaster: it doesnt give error about the function, but it says not in a function, shall i check distanceTo?
 Doju: ohh
 Adnmaster: at the other parts of the code, there is not error of the function though
 Doju: um
 Doju: i think there's an error in the definition of distanceTo
 Doju: typo?
 Adnmaster: wait
 Adnmaster: i dont think its a typo
 Adnmaster: but i will check
 Doju: or typo where you're calling it?
 Doju: Ah
 Adnmaster: nope
 Adnmaster: not typo
 Doju: Does the definition come before where you call it?
 Doju: i think it has to
 Adnmaster: it does
 Adnmaster: it comes at the program beginning
 Doju: so is the error on that line?
 Doju: it might be that you need a space after elif
 Doju: so elif (ability_cooldowns[a] == 0 and distanceTo(d, d2, pac_x[a], pac_y[a]) &gt; 10):
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: wait let me check
 Adnmaster: still error
 Doju: are you sure that you've called if something before that?
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: wait it worked
 Adnmaster: thanks very much
 Doju: lol :P
 Doju: np
 Adnmaster: now there is another error lol
 Adnmaster: :D
 Adnmaster: aahh
 Adnmaster: finally got it!!
 Adnmaster: yes!!!!
 Doju: great!
 Adnmaster: i did this: pac_x[a], instead of this: pac_x[my_pac_id[a]]
 Doju: oh
 Doju: okay
 Adnmaster: wait...
 Adnmaster: nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: waiting, yes or no&#160;?
 Adnmaster: i though it was fixed!
 AntiSquid: i bet i am rank 1 in the captcha game this contest
 Adnmaster: captcha game?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: you unlock it if you submit bot enough times
 AntiSquid: it's a secret bonus level
 Adnmaster: i never heard of that, can you explain more?
 AntiSquid: no more spoilers
 Adnmaster: :D ok
 AntiSquid: use your skills to unlock it
 Doju: you can try it yourself
 Adnmaster: ok
 carlnix: Hey guys
 AntiSquid: hi

 AntiSquid: just jump in submit a bot and see how it goes
 carlnix: Sure
 muy31: yo Doju how early were you up?
 Adnmaster: winning with 1 point :D: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463560600">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463560600</a>
 Doju: uhhh maybe 8:15?
 Doju: why?
 muy31: weren't you online at 1:00 am finland time yesterday?
 muy31: cause it was 5pm my time
 Doju: i went to bed at 3 am xD
 Doju: trying to fix my sleep schedule
 muy31: lol i see
 Doju: tired as hell
 Doju: but hey more time to code :p
 jrke: anyone knows how to know response time in c++
 Adnmaster: how
 muy31: im really annoyed right now that the reason i cant get too gold is b/c i use switch
 Tiramon: then use switch less?
 Adnmaster: do you keep your pacs alive with switch?
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: i mean its just that i use an extremely logical switch to survive, but the other pacs just ignoe me
 Adnmaster: oh
 muy31: so it's pointless
 Adnmaster: yeah, then better dont use it
 muy31: but it's logically adept
 Adnmaster: youre in bronze, right?
 muy31: silver
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: ok
 Tiramon: silver without speed? nice
 jrke: anybody to my ques
 muy31: no i use speed definitely
 muy31: i just dont always use speed
 Adnmaster: youre in silver, im in bronze, can i see our battle?
 muy31: i dont know how to switch the leagues
 Tiramon: get ranked above the boss
 muy31: i dont think i can play against another league, can i?
 Tiramon: oh you mean play against lower leagues
 muy31: yeah
 Akarachudra: there are another rules. u cant
 Tiramon: you can
 muy31: how?
 Adnmaster: but arent all the rules unlocked in bronze?
 Tiramon: but the opponent selector has a limit ... in top league it is top 1k players
 Adnmaster: so isnt bronze and silver same?
 muy31: i want to battle Adnmaster
 Adnmaster: let us battle
 Adnmaster: wait
 Tiramon: else it is top x in current league and less
 Adnmaster: im checking if i can
 Adnmaster: oh we cant
 muy31: yeah
 Tiramon: only higher league player can select
 Adnmaster: oh
 Tiramon: bronze can't see silver but silver has a chance to see bronze
 muy31: but i cant see him
 Adnmaster: muy31 can you send replay
 Adnmaster: you cant see me?
 muy31: no
 muy31: it only goes to 197th place in silver
 Doju: i'm so deep in the wikipedia pages atm
 Doju: trying to solve some pathfinding problems
 muy31: now 199 in bronze
 muy31: Adnmaster get above 199th place
 Tiramon: sure even i can see 669 in silver
 Adnmaster: ok
 Tiramon:&#160;?
 Adnmaster: ill try
 muy31: my bad Tiramon it was a mistake i meant bronze
 Tiramon: k
 Tiramon: still sad that they limit it to 1k
 Adnmaster: whats the formula to find my distance to another pac?
 Doju: Adnmaster it depends
 Doju: what do you want to do
 Doju: the actual walking distance or an approximation?
 Adnmaster: for example if my pac is away from the enemy pac it will use speed
 Adnmaster: not walking distance
 muy31: you can use Manhattan for that
 Adnmaster: manhattan?
 Doju: then manhattan is fine
 Tiramon: muy31 why you switched to rock in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463574147">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463574147</a>&#160;?
 Tiramon: in frame 34
 Doju: abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
 Adnmaster: i used that but it didnt work
 Doju: it should
 WINWINWIN: it does not take portals into account
 Adnmaster: hmm...
 Adnmaster: wait
 muy31: the assumption that you would switch to scissors and chase me
 WINWINWIN: I copied the distance from the referee
 muy31: Tiramon
 WINWINWIN: that is a lot more accurate
 muy31: Adnmaster then use modulus...
 Tiramon: yes guessed that, but i passed you 2 times as paper ... why would i switch at the 3rd time?
 muy31: my bot doesn't extrapolate
 muy31: it's not that smart...
 Tiramon: so it's just distance == 1so switch
 Tiramon: btw i couldn't switch to scissor .. i had cooldown
 Tiramon: one more reason for you to switch to scissor instead of rock
 Tiramon: same in frame 68 i had cooldown and you expected me to get rock
 muy31: did i switch them up then?
 muy31: thanks for replay Tiramon
 Tiramon: np&#160;;)
 Adnmaster: trick to league up: find what the boss does, convert it into code, then submit that code :D
 perseverent: hi
 perseverent: did anybody reach gold without pathfinding?
 RoboStac: Adnmaster - if it's that easy then just skip the bosses and watch replays on the leaderboard from #1
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 perseverent: is it possible?
 muy31: Tiramon is the green bar accurate? for cooldown
 Adnmaster: ok then :D
 Tiramon: log and player are not 100% sync, but i guess the bar should be accurate
 eulerscheZahl: tooltips only show SPEED cooldown, but not the reload&#160;:(
 Tiramon: else print abilitycooldown from input
 muy31: Tiramon you in gold?
 wlesavo: im always printing out the cooldown in msg, seems to be the most relevant info
 MiniWall: Hey guys, any way to change the cerr output color&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, greasemonkey
 perseverent: I take it as a no then
 muy31: its a chrome extension
 perseverent: I'll go and implement some kind of BFS then
 wlesavo: is it the same as Violentmonkey?
 Alshock: eulerscheZahl I like that answer
 perseverent: hope it's worth it
 JohnCM: manhattan can go to bronze
 JohnCM: i didn't do bfs until silver
 muy31: like tampermonkey
 perseverent: what about gold
 perseverent: manhattan works?
 JohnCM: haha haven't tried
 JohnCM: i think best to use bfs in gold
 muy31: for real ive been doing bfs since bronze
 perseverent: I mean for silver boss
 perseverent: can you beat with mnhattan?
 muy31: probably not
 perseverent: I see
 perseverent: no hope for me

 lexXxel: oh come one
 lexXxel: Hi guys, are there any known issues with the pellet input?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 lexXxel: thx
 WINWINWIN: lexXxel I have not faced any yet
 eulerscheZahl: try to flush your stderr
 eulerscheZahl: print(..., flush=True)
 lexXxel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8016871-941b-4e0e-8c5f-0a862ef06147">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8016871-941b-4e0e-8c5f-0a862ef06147</a>
 WINWINWIN: what does that do eule
 WINWINWIN: *euler
 Alshock: it makes sure to print
 eulerscheZahl: i bet you get all input but don't see it in the logs. that forces to print everything
 eulerscheZahl: you probably get stuck somewhere below in your code
 TheNiv: Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move- what does this means?
 muy31: hey perseverent due to pathfinding issues, your rock got stuck <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463591073">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463591073</a>
 WINWINWIN: what is the use of flush eulerscheZahl
 WINWINWIN:&#160;?
 Alshock: TheNiv SPEED allows to move twice in a turn
 TheNiv: wow I missed a lot
 perseverent:&#160;:)
 perseverent: I know
 Alshock: once with all other pacs, and once afterwards
 perseverent: manhattan does that
 eulerscheZahl: print(f"get pellet {i}: {line}", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 TheNiv: oh ok
 lexXxel: @eulerischeZahl thx, I used sys.stdout.flush() and failed to replace it with stderr 
 lexXxel: xD
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Alshock: lol sys.stderr.flush() should work though
 lexXxel: yeah
 Alshock: I didn't even know there was an option for it in print
 lexXxel: but i failed and copied sys.stdout.flush()
 Alshock: I feel you
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of users got stuck here. they should just change the default stub or change the way they call your python bot as robo suggested on the forum
 Alshock: I guess they don't want to do that kind of change because they're affraid to be asked to change them for all languages
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they will change it. just not as fast as we hope
 eulerscheZahl: 1434 python players in this contest. the most popular language, worth doing such a small change
 WINWINWIN: anyone think the contest will touch 5000 participants?
 muy31: come on, ive been below rank 20 in silver for a day now,,, im 5
 muy31: someone submit and boost me
 Tiramon: how much score behind theboss?
 WINWINWIN: muy31 collaborative submitting is extremely important :P
 muy31: what does that mean?
 MattSOrme: I actually found out my problem wasn't with flush, but that i timed out on the previous turn
 muy31: Tiramon
 WINWINWIN: I got to silver because the guy who I was especially good against kept submitting :P
 Tiramon: muy in the leader board it is shown a score for you and the boss
 Tiramon: and i want to know the diff
 Tiramon: sometimes it is high even if only a few ranks apart then i won't expect to be pushed up
 muy31: me: 24.75 vs. 26.05
 eulerscheZahl: Tiramon just find a battle with the boss and open it. then you see the score of the boss below
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible to get pushed up but i wouldn't bet on it
 Tiramon: oh nice didn't know that
 Tiramon: &lt; 1 is quit ok, normally i expect to be pushed up with &lt; 0.5
 eulerscheZahl: even cgstats shows the boss now, if it's part of any of the past battles
 WINWINWIN: Is the boss part of the final ranking?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 muy31: Tiramon you think i should resubmit then if I think my new code is better?
 muy31: even though im ranked 5?
 Tiramon: depends on how much better&#160;;)
 muy31: that's rough
 Tiramon: if you always win against your arena bot it sure is worth a try
 Tiramon: worst case you get ranked lower
 muy31: it's not that much better its 50/50
 Tiramon: with a bit of luck you get a lot of winning matches and get ranked higher, or maybe you had luck and will get ranked lower
 Tiramon: wouldn't resubmit in that case
 Tiramon: find a better improvement
 muy31: also silver bot doesnt switch at all
 Hjax: switching is overrated
 Tiramon: especially because the 8 ranks below you have a very low diff to you
 eulerscheZahl: switching for a kill is still a nice thing
 Tiramon: if you kill some pacs in the first turns it's very powerful, else it often is a waste of score
 eulerscheZahl: but now that i'm speeding almost all the time, i rarely do it&#160;:(
 Tiramon: except you avoid being killed
 WINWINWIN: speed is better than switch???
 Tiramon: imho
 muy31: yes
 WINWINWIN: I never do speed -_-
 WINWINWIN: I only switch rarely
 MattSOrme: then you might want to change your name
 muy31: thats mean
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) MattSOrme will rather change speed :P
 eulerscheZahl: WINWINWIN you should speed for sure. i beat you with 1 vs 2 :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463602594">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463602594</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but that switch was definitely helpful
 WINWINWIN: :D will do that, maybe start with switch at lower priority and work up from there
 eulerscheZahl: there are still some interesting moves from my bot that i should debug in that match
 IronBeast_24c7: Can we make the console output re-sizable. It's a nightmare to deal with ..
 JohnCM: i have some issues with my bot now
 JohnCM: the more i modify, the more i realize i had 2 bugs all along
 JohnCM: but somehow it worked
 Tiramon: oh you really meant 1vs2 ... ouch
 muy31: eulerscheZahl what do you even do with the info of possible opponent locations
 eulerscheZahl: remove pellets from the map
 Doju: Damn, collaborative pathing is really difficult to do
 Tiramon: frame 48 and moves like that are things i don't really understand
 eulerscheZahl: in my replay? i'm looking into it right now...
 muy31: it appears he is extrapolating on further turns
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's probably harvested already <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/6K46FzS">https://imgur.com/a/6K46FzS</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so better tracking would help for sure here. or another scoring
 muy31: he sees two 100% pellets in one that he could get vs 4 in the opposite direction
 muy31: so he goes for the four
 muy31: i think
 Tiramon: so you expect the pellets behind the corner to be gone?
 muy31: less than 100%
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 21% chance it's still there
 Tiramon: interesting visulization
 eulerscheZahl: but when i'm so close i should just look around the corner
 muy31: ive been doing the ame technique, how come im in silver
 AntiSquid: how's it going ZarthaxX&#160;?
 muy31: oh rank 12
 muy31: ...
 Tiramon: as i said those guys behind you were very close in score
 muy31: im going to start tracking enemies then
 Tiramon: i got basic enemy tracking but ignore the information
 MattSOrme: damn, if thats what it takes to be top 10, i'll be lucky to maek gold
 Doju: WOW
 Doju: muy
 Doju: your switching is on point
 muy31: show me...
 muy31: please
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463586620">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463586620</a>
 Doju: frame 31
 Tiramon: thats why i never attack a pack with available cooldown
 Doju: you predicted that i'd switch to scissors
 muy31: yea, but now you see the problem right?
 Doju: yup
 Doju: also what on earth is my pac 0 doing on frame 16
 Doju: "nope, don't like that pellet"
 muy31: lol
 Doju: Oh i see what it's doing
 Doju: alright
 Doju: it thinks there's a pellet behind the corner
 lorus: ohh god
 Doju: oh no it doesn't
 Doju: it's going for the super pellet
 Doju: maybe i'm giving them a bit too much value hahah
 muy31: i see
 muy31: i guess value should also depend on distance
 muy31: what do you think
 Doju: atm i don't do values other than 0, 1 and 10
 Doju: but yes definitely
 Doju: that's gonna be a thing soon
 Tiramon: distance is very important
 Doju: and some other things
 Tiramon: else you aim for a pellet at distance 6 and ignore the one at distance 1
 Doju: well
 Doju: the idea with my current system was to go for super pellets even if their distance is greater than 10 and there's a normal pellet right next to me
 muy31: eulerscheZahl you doing like probability of opponent moving to a new location = 70%, prob of moving to an old location 20% and prob of ataying still 10%?
 Doju: since there can be normal pellets on the way there
 Tiramon: even with more than 1 pac per superpellet?
 muy31: or do you 100% assume that your opponent will move to an unexplored location?
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, i won't get too much into detail here
 muy31: ok then np
 Doju: Tiramon atm they don't care if there's another pac going for the same pellet
 Hjax: come on euler, spill all of your secrets :P 
 Doju: working on fixing that right now
 lxnn: muy31, surely it would be best not to make any assumptions about the opponent's movement, and so model their behaviour as uniformly random
 lxnn: remember, probabilistic logic is monotonic, so if your model gets into an 'overly certain' state, it's unlikely to get back to an appropriately uncertain state again
 lxnn: although you might just want to manually tweak the parameters, as naive probabilistic models can sometimes miraculously perform well
 lxnn: just my two cents
 NormantasStankevicius: heyo, gin league
 muy31: cool Ixnn
 Ramzel: Currently First in Bronze hope that i will go up soon
 Ramzel: Yey welcome silver
 AntiSquid: ya that's about enough to graduate from bronze
 AntiSquid: nvm too late
 AntiSquid: chat lags
 Ramzel: Are there any new rules in gold?
 Hjax: no new rules in gold 
 Ramzel: ok
 AntiSquid: wroclaw back to 1st place eh&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463633476">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463633476</a>that brilliant plan at frame 54: 2 papers can trap the rock, completely ignoring the scissors :D
 Ramzel: Is there information about dead pacs usefull?
 jrke: hey to return two or more values from a function in c++ anybody please
 Ramzel: u can return a vector of informations
 Ramzel: jrke
 DamianS: use pair&lt;&gt;
 jrke: ya but not working 
 Ramzel: or tuple to store more then to informations
 Ramzel: u can also use for example pair of pairs
 Ramzel: and so on
 jrke: my return statement   return std::make_pair(rx,ry);
 Ramzel: And what is the compiler log?
 jrke: means
 Tiramon: wow pac tracking costs quite some time
 WINWINWIN: Looks like another guy going to gold now
 Tiramon: especially if the pac isn't seen for a longer time
 Ramzel: Tiramon what league are u in?
 Tiramon: gold
 Tiramon: but lower rnaks in gold
 Tiramon: *ranks
 WINWINWIN: Is a pathfinder necessary for gold?
 Tiramon: not sure if pathfinding is needed, i wrote a simple simulation  to avoid blocking and gather pellets effective
 Ramzel: What do u mean by gathering pellets effective?
 Ramzel: :D
 leodark: hi
 EvModder: lol i have an awful algorithm for gathering pellets
 EvModder: but i am pretty good at combat&#160;;)
 Tiramon: if i run through a block of pellets and have 2 directions to leave that block it's more effective to leave it at the side were another pellet is know instead of an empty area
 Tiramon: also those 1 pellet deadend walk by are also quite uneffective imho
 EvModder: i think a good idea would be to mark dead ends on your grid, and prioritize those lower
 Tiramon: why should i go for one pellet in a dead end ... so yes 
 EvModder: i dont find pellet-collecting algos as fun to write as fighting stuff&#160;:) 
 Tiramon: a way to gather more pellets in a shorter time&#160;;)
 Tiramon: fight can be avoided to easily to invest much time
 EvModder: actually, my pellet-collecting strat DOES consider dead ends, but only because I already wrote the code to use it for detecting is a pac is trapped lol
 goolmoos: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463651032">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463651032</a>
 Tiramon: if you really kill all early it is nice, but that isn't easy
 EvModder: did he time out?
 goolmoos: no
 goolmoos: I just are them all
 EvModder: oh i see
 EvModder: very tasty&#160;:)
 EvModder: is there a way to play against a specific player?
 goolmoos: yes
 goolmoos: add them in the IDE
 goolmoos: click delete below the Default AI
 goolmoos: and then add whoever you want
 EvModder: oh wow thanks!
 NormantasStankevicius: just jumped with a dumb fix 1200spots... to silver 254
 Tiramon: but choice is limited to players of your league or below limit(1k)
 EvModder: i feel you norman
 NormantasStankevicius: it's the definition I don't know why is it working, but it is
 Quidome: You can invite players in lower leagues but not the other way around
 EvModder: i dropped 100 spots yesterday because of a bad submission. i still don't know what was wrong. i just kept working on it and slowly climbing back up
 NormantasStankevicius: people improved their code evModder?
 EvModder: it was a submission
 NormantasStankevicius: ohhh, you're top 93
 EvModder: it is still deciding, i am 106 now
 NormantasStankevicius: in high gold *
 EvModder: hopefully it goes up but  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 EvModder: ya i've put too much time into this lol
 Ramzel: 367's in silver
 Ramzel: not bad at all
 EvModder: a friend told me to join but now im playing more than him
 njaber: I like seeing collecting pellets as one giant fight over territory with the enemy, this makes it more fun&#160;;)
 njaber: wait I was this far back in chat
 njaber: EvModder I was replying to a message you sent way earlier
 EvModder: oh yea
 EvModder: the territory war :D
 EvModder: my pacs also have 0 collaboration rn, for pellet-collecting nor fighting
 EvModder: they are smart but not good team players, yet
 njaber: the problem with collaboration is that it transform the decision making time from (numberOfAction * numberOfPac) to (numberOfActions ^ numberOdPac)
 njaber: and with 5 pacs this can mean up to 9 ^ 5 which is a lot
 njaber: wait no 11 ^5
 njaber: No i'm dumb it's 9 since you can't have "move 2" and "use abilitiy" possibilities at once
 Kellthazar: Im stuck trying to implement an alternative for my heuristc approach
 EvModder: heuristics all the way man
 EvModder: magic numbers ftw (:
 Kellthazar: Yeah, but my code with heurist is so bloated right now...
 Kellthazar: Im trying to implement Monte Carlo Tree Search...
 Ikhadem: i can't improve this shit no more 
 llllllllll: same feeling I had since sunday
 Doju: THis is in no way related to coding, but does anyone here know a good inventory/warehouse management app?
 llllllllll: and every day I could do a lot more to improve
 AntiSquid: fixed the most crucial bug!
 AntiSquid: could have done it sooner but w/e
 Kellthazar: Yeah, Ill be back to my heuristc algo... See if I can improve any aspect of it
 AntiSquid: my emojis are now working perfectly
 MattSOrme: lol, are they meant to mean something or just random?
 mamitiana: hi all! how can i speed multiple PAC pls&#160;? in python
 Quidome: you seperate each command with a |
 EvModder: AntiSquid i love your emojis man
 MattSOrme: you need to get a target 2+ moves away, and print them on the same lineMOVE 0 10 10 | MOVE 1 15 15
 AntiSquid: thanks! EvModder
 AntiSquid: ofc they do, they hold the key to the universe MattSOrme
 EvModder: before i knew how to pick who i play against in IDE (lol until today), i played you in random matches and copied to IDE
 AntiSquid: lol
 Quidome: 4512 submits&#160;:)
 EvModder: dang lol
 Illedan: 4k submits?
 Quidome: 4.5k :D
 Illedan: -.-
 EvModder: 49&#160;:)
 EvModder: and i thought i was spamming it XD
 Illedan: You can't test in the IDE Quidome?
 Quidome: uh i mean different players of course
 EvModder: about to make it 50
 AntiSquid: how&#160;? when&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: Quidome
 Quidome: Big confusion now
 EvModder: you can copy players to the IDE from matches, or pick them by clicking under the AI
 EvModder: i learned this today myself 
 Quidome: I mean 4513 different players have submitted a bot 
 Quidome: I find that very amazing :D
 EvModder: ah ok yea it is!
 EvModder: i thought you meant that you submitted 4513 different updates of your bot code 
 EvModder: (which would also be amazing)
 Quidome: lol
 Doju: does submitting the default code count as a submission?
 Quidome: I think so
 Doju: because i bet like half of those are that
 llllllllll: those are in wood 2
 llllllllll: and not counted imo
 Doju: wdym going to one spot isn't a valid strategy
 EvModder: yeah, i don't think those can beat the boss and actually enter
 MattSOrme: ugh, i swear i've just spent the last 2 days making my code worse&#160;:(
 Quidome: 231 in wood 2, so max 231 default code submits
 EvModder:&#160;:( 
 llllllllll: @Matt I know that feeling ^^
 Paikan2068: @MattSOrme, same
 EvModder: yeah.. especially yesterday
 Paikan2068: Anyhow, we try and learn
 EvModder: I got so tired, and then submitted and dropped 100 places
 Paikan2068: Learning by failure is painful
 Doju: that's pretty good Quidome
 Paikan2068: but I guess even the best at this learnt by failure as well :p
 JohnCM: no worries @evmodder, you'll gain it back
 EvModder: i have, mostly  :)
 EvModder: new day, new energy
 JohnCM: there's a fluctuation of +- 100 when you submit
 JohnCM: depends on your initial luck
 JohnCM: after that will stabilize over the next few days
 EvModder: oh i know about the flectuation, i was responding to  MattSOrme
 MattSOrme: my code from 2 days ago is technically going up in the league, but not sure if thats just cos other people are leaving
 EvModder: might be, or perhaps it just stabilizes
 MattSOrme: Got too many ideas that Im just not implementing well
 EvModder: i think it plays too few games initially, so if you are unlucky it puts you lower than you should be
 Paikan2068: I think my best code was when I didn't care, like 5 days ago.. Then I went up with the bigger guns, and totally missed the implementations
 EvModder: and it gets fixed over time
 EvModder: ahh yeah
 EvModder: i've been sticking to incremental improvements so far but i hav big dreams i might attempt later
 Paikan2068: I guess, that's the way to learn also
 EvModder: like having pacs actually collaborate :joy:
 Doju: do you guys have a class for all your pacs
 JohnCM: my pacs just avoid each other
 EvModder: I have names for them if that counts
 Doju: like not a pac class but an "all the pacs" class
 JohnCM: but by doing so they collaborate
 JohnCM: emergence by simple rules, i call it
 Paikan2068: I'd like to not timeout with my bfs and a* for 10% of my games
 Paikan2068: that would already be a great improvement
 EvModder: Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Crabs &lt;- my pac names
 njaber: I made the mistake of starting with the big dream, now I'm fully commited and I don't know if I'll actually have something to submit better then silver in time
 EvModder: naming them is proven an effective strategy.
 Doju: njaber type away then!
 Doju: i'm also making quite a big change atm
 Doju: if it works it'll surely get me to gold
 njaber: I've been coding almost 20 hours a day (not an exageration) since the beginning of the challenge XD
 Doju: same njaber
 JohnCM: lol that's too much
 Doju: or maybe not 20
 Doju: more like 14
 Doju: or 15
 Paikan2068: Let's say that at least you get to learn things!
 Doju: Paikan2068 oh definitely
 Doju: i've  learned sooo many things
 AntiSquid: you need breaks, have fun, don't overexhaust njaber, did you even add emojis to your pacs yet?
 Doju: This is the biggest coding project i've done
 JohnCM: how to put emojis?
 EvModder: my next big goals for tomorrow: (1) guessing enemy next N moves after they leave LOS, (2) having one of my pacs let the other move if it is blocked
 Doju: unicode chars
 AntiSquid: exhaustion creates most bugs
 JohnCM: ah..
 Doju: AntiSquid yeah that's true tho
 EvModder: so true
 njaber: I've saddly come to the conclusion that to make my algorithm work I'll need a lot of bayesian calculations which I didn't have until now, so I'mm reworking a lot of it, and I don't know if 3 days are enough&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://getemoji.com/">https://getemoji.com/</a> copy one from there and add them as you would add a mesage to your pac outputs JohnCM
 Doju: bayesian calculation
 Doju: oh damn
 Doju: actually i kinda need that too
 njaber: Antisquad no I haven't but I don't have something to submit&#160;:/
 EvModder: sounds so fancy :3
 EvModder: i use "magic"
 njaber: Also that's how I have fun usually, I'm not overexhausting myself
 AntiSquid: naive bayes like relations between stuff&#160;?
 JohnCM: thanks antisquid
 AntiSquid: np
 EvModder: i assign every square a "magic value" and then each pac greedily goes along the most "magical" trail
 Doju: hmm
 njaber: I don't know how deap I'll go into bayesinism, for now I'm just doing normal probablities without conditions which isn't even working yet
 AntiSquid: but with adding emojis comes the responsibility to raise in rank so more people notice them JohnCM
 EvModder: and a lot of random, complex junk goes into how i assign the magic values
 AntiSquid: rise *
 njaber: But I'll need a little bit of it to estimate enemy pos, the limit will be how much bayesianism I can do in 50ms
 Doju: i did a little thinking
 Doju: i wanna get every possible path between any given cells of given length n
 Doju: and i need to do that... many times
 EvModder: what for? there might be an easier solution
 Doju: magic
 EvModder: ah&#160;:)
 EvModder: BFS is the solution general for distance
 Doju: yup
 Doju: i need every possible path though
 Doju: that's a little more intensive
 EvModder: from every x1,y1 to every x2,y2&#160;?
 Paikan2068: but even with that in mind, you have to find a heuristic to design targets which works fine. And then collaboration... and so on and so on
 JohnCM: how do i put the emoji in
 JohnCM: like
 JohnCM:  😇
 llllllllll: in python: \U0001f914
 JohnCM: i'm gonna put an emoji right before i crush my opponent's pac
 Doju: EvModder yes
 EvModder: i think you just print it after the move JognCM
 JohnCM: oh how did you get the unicode?
 llllllllll: I do the same, with the kiss emoji
 llllllllll: unicode emoji list
 llllllllll: google
 njaber: Well, you can be sure there is at most (dist / 2) ^2 paths, and I think you could just branch "closer neighboors" until you hit your destinations with all paths
 EvModder: Doju that is W*H * W*H memory :sweat_smile:
 EvModder: but that is doable i think
 EvModder: as a preprocess step, certainly
 Doju: umm how did you get (dist / 2)^2?
 EvModder: each cell will need a grid for the distance to each other cell
 Doju: i have that
 llllllllll: me too
 llllllllll: much faster to look it up than to calc every time
 EvModder: lol i hav no clue what u guys need all that for
 Doju: i already told you
 Doju: magic
 EvModder: ah right
 MSmits: :six_pointed_star:
 llllllllll: I use it to get the 'real distance' between 2 cells
 llllllllll: that comes handy sometimes
 Paikan2068: Just use BFS, quite a lot faster than you might think at first
 EvModder: llllllllll that makes sense actually, for caching/performance i guess. i haven't had issues with the time limit yet really
 MSmits: they do use BFS Paikan2068
 EvModder: or, if i have, it was because of a bug in my code
 MSmits: they just do it all on turn 1
 llllllllll: we do bfs, but for every cell in turn 1
 MSmits: and then lookup the result
 llllllllll: exactly
 Paikan2068: Oh, yeah, good point
 MSmits: i dont think it's workable for me, pacs block movement
 EvModder: yall are smart now i want to do this too. even though i dont need to
 MSmits: i dont do it EvModder
 MSmits: ive done it for other contests, but dont see the point here
 EvModder: yeah time limit is pretty generous
 MSmits: thats not why
 MSmits: all my path calculations include pacs blocking
 EvModder: ah
 MSmits: and thats different all the time
 EvModder: pacs move around though
 MSmits: yes
 Doju: those you can't precalculate
 EvModder: so distance makes sense somewhat if you expect them to move away
 Doju: or maybe if you're reeeally smat about it
 Doju: you might
 MSmits: well.. i dont have any other Doju

 njaber: Doju
 MSmits: well except maybe hardcoding for superpellets
 MSmits: i gotta get that working
 EvModder: my super pellet handling has caused me a lot of losses
 MSmits: mine too
 njaber: Don't know if that helps
 EvModder: that, and not thinking before going around corners (which i will work on tomorrow)
 Doju: Oh i see, thanks njaber
 Paikan2068: I don't know what caused me many of my losses, but I'm starting to lose hope, and tell myself I should probably get back to actually work on theory :p
 EvModder:&#160;:(
 Petras: Hey guys, what are the conditions for pac switching? (- Pac 2 can't switch to ROCK form yet!) yet xdd Coldown = 0 and SpeedTurn = 0
 njaber: maybe he's already a rock?
 Petras: I'm missing something here
 Doju: I think it's time to put the lofi girl on the second monitor and start coding
 njaber: or he's dead?
 jrke: ya maybe already rock 
 Paikan2068: Eh, but wait, my last submit is actually doing quite good
 EvModder: oh yeah, the dead thing can trip you up
 Petras: He's alive and of different type o_O
 MSmits: yeah thats life
 EvModder: my last submit was a very pleasant surprise for me
 Paikan2068: Yeah, but will it beat the bot :p
 Paikan2068: that's the terrible question
 MSmits: Petras share a replay
 Petras: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463707000">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463707000</a>
 MSmits: frame?
 Petras: turn 25 pacID 2
 Counterbalance: referee only prints that if cooldown&#160;!= 0
 Petras: oh yeah I'm stupid
 Petras: .. nevermind.. :DDD
 jrke: see its not cooldown petras
 Paikan2068: I'm actually starting to believe, 48 fights for this sbmit, 5 losses...
 MSmits: it became a rock
 MattSOrme: ok, so im gonna go back to my old submitted code that was better, and start adding bits from my new code to it nicely
 MSmits: you denied its rock-hood, it's a rock
 Paikan2068: Good luck Matt
 Petras: xd
 jrke: petras which league
 MattSOrme: I will get to gold if it kills me
 Paikan2068: Oh, and just when I told that, a terrible 4 loss serie
 Petras: gold
 jrke: wow
 MSmits: allright back to coding
 jrke: yuo
 jrke: *yup
 EvModder: hmm, i like my ranking, so i might nap for a bit actually lol
 KCrown: how do you get gold? at what rank us each league?
 njaber: I need to optimize a specific part of my C# code (~25 lines) can I copy it here to ask for ideas?
 njaber: about 25 lines *
 Paikan2068: KCrown you have to beat the boss to change league
 EvModder: i would advise not, to be on the safe side
 KCrown: thanks
 EvModder: site rules and etc. maybe link a pastebin though?
 njaber: Too bad
 jrke: KCrown you should beat the boss I.e. above boss
 Hvosten: Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move
 njaber: I though it wasn't ok to link a pastebin either?
 Hvosten: What that this mean?
 EvModder: idk
 MattSOrme: It means only pacs with speed active who chose a target 2 or more away will move
 EvModder: yes
 jrke: Hvosten it means only pac with speed availibility can move in this chance
 Hvosten: Ok thanks
 njaber: Actually I can reduce it to 5 lines, 5 lines of codes wouldn't be problematic would it?
 Counterbalance: nope, go ahead
 njaber: Actually 10
 njaber: Well I'll copy the 10
 njaber: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9144dc8f-2856-45cb-a313-7ccb157cc47d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9144dc8f-2856-45cb-a313-7ccb157cc47d</a>
 njaber: IVec2 is a custom class I made, and I can paste thee code for GetNeighboors if you think this could be the thing slowing down
 njaber: Oh and I forgot the declaration of pos1Cells
 njaber: Actually, I'll try rewritting GetNeighboors first, I'll store a reference to each valid neighboors for each cell during the initialization turn
 journeyvivek: nice
 njaber: but if you've got other ideas it'd be hellpful
 Counterbalance: what's the purpose of that code? make a collection of all 'lastCells' and their neighbours?

 jrke: why my rank suddenly became 8 and next submission suddenly 316 without any changes in code:thinking:
 cegprakash: my rank dropped by 60 not surprising
 njaber: Counterbalance the pastebin contains my answer, I'm just too verbose XD
 alinde2: Being "first" after the boss is rather fun. :upside_down:
 gangland6001: dafuk
 Counterbalance: njaber i see. You're re-calculating that for the past 20 turns each turn?
 njaber: no for the past I have another algorithm which is pretty efficient and remembers previous turn's calculations, this one is for future turns
 Tiipiac: I have an issue with the input, it seems like I do not receive the last line of it. I should be seeing 34 pellets now when only 33 are given.&#160;:(
 Tiipiac: Can anyone help me please?
 njaber: For now it's not much more useful then a distance except that it takes all current possible pos of the enemy into account, but later I plan on adding probabilities to the each movement so I'll need this map to be generate
 Counterbalance: Tiipiac there's some messages on the forum about that
 Tiipiac: thx
 Kukiss: Tiipiac maybe you have modified something by accident there. You can restore the code to the default one to see hot it looks like. (ofc store your code somewhere else first)
 Kukiss: how*
 Doju: Is there a way to jump to the definition of a method in the ide?
 Doju: i tried everything i could think of
 [CG]Nonofr: in the CG ide?
 Doju: yes
 Tiipiac: I will try this yes.
 Doju: Apparently there's a keybindings file
 Doju: i'll have to edit that i guess
 RoboStac: Tiipiac - it's probably that, it's most likely an issue with python buffering your logs (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/180397/67?u=robostac">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/180397/67?u=robostac</a>)
 [CG]Nonofr: In what language Doju?
 Doju: Python 3
 [CG]Nonofr: If it doesn't work, just refresh the page
 [CG]Nonofr: ctrl+click on it should work
 [CG]Nonofr: I just fixed it&#160;!&#160;:)
 Tiipiac: I tried to refresh but it does not work either
 Doju: Yup now it works, thanks [CG]Nonofr
 Tiipiac: I will try the post solution from @RoboStac
 Tiipiac: @RoboStac it worked, thank you!
 Tiipiac: I flushed it&#160;;) 
 Tiramon: ok .. it works like expected to bad i expected it will take to much time ...
 Tiramon: 5 speed moves after another result in quite many possible path and final locations ...
 njaber: You working on tracking?
 Tiramon: try to track the pacs to find out where they are and what path they took (or maybe took_) so i can ignore those pellets
 Tiramon: less looking around the corner with the 'too late' feedback
 Tiramon: not working well
 njaber: I've gt good news for you, it's defenitly possible in less then 50ms since I'm already doing, I haven't implemented all features yet but it's gonna be faster when I implement them since there'll be less paths to extend
 Tiramon: incl path?
 njaber: Yeah everything
 Tiramon: hm ok 
 Tiramon: then i will have to rethink that part a bit more
 EvModder: i haven't done that yet, i will in my next iteration tho probably
 njaber: that's not exactly true actualy, I can check if they've taken a given path, but I can't easily list them all
 Tiramon: hm got just another idea how to prune the amount
 EvModder: right now i only keep track of the last location i saw them at, so i dont run away then just turn around and go right back into the danger zone
 njaber: isting all paths is hard though, because there's a lot they could have taken from the last seen point to all possible end point, how I do it is that I basically regroup each path by length and turn they could have passed a given cells, then I can deduduce back the possbility of the enemy taking a given path
 cegprakash: njaber why no gold yet
 cegprakash: :D
 njaber: because no submit because my code isn't ready
 njaber: I'm getting closer though
 njaber: But I have to implement a few probabilitic/bayesian logics before it's usable
 njaber: Currently it does what I imagined it would do but it basically thniks about the absolute worst case scenario, I think it'd do really well with perfect info, but I need to allow it to make decisions in cases where there are too many worst case scenarios
 cegprakash: I assume opponent is stupid at times
 cegprakash: :D
 njaber: I'm now regretting leaving Wood1, I would have liked to test my code in a perfect info situation
 njaber: It would really help with debbuging
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f">https://www.codingame.com/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f</a>
 cegprakash: no the place u need to test is gold
 eulerscheZahl: switch leagues at the top right
 njaber: Oh thanks, that helps a lot!
 cegprakash: I hope by the end of this contest I'll become Doctor Strange
 eulerscheZahl: play BotG, then you can get him right now
 MattSOrme: Why does history not tell you what rank it got to&#160;:(
 Hjax: that would be a nice feature 
 eulerscheZahl: CG Enhancer
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441</a>
 AntiSquid: but you need to add rank mannualy no&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 wlesavo: and after that it sometimes disappears
 eulerscheZahl: i make screenshots when it's going well. then i have the date+time at least
 wlesavo: that an idea
 Hjax: i do most of my testing locally anyway 
 eulerscheZahl: i configured my print key to directly save it in a chosen directory
 Hjax: submits are just for finding edge case bugs 
 AntiSquid: doesn't matter much atm, seems like the outcome is very random, the bots in mid gold are of similar strength
 AntiSquid: you don't notice it probably
 eulerscheZahl: random at the top too
 eulerscheZahl: val growth was 1st
 eulerscheZahl: saw him below 10, i don't think he submitted since
 Hjax: the top also drops a lot of games vs the middle of gold 
 eulerscheZahl: because the game is quite random
 Hjax: yeah
 Hjax: i hope by the end the winner is clear, rather than lucky 
 eulerscheZahl: for other contest like wondev woman you didn't see that. almost 100% winrate for the top players
 eulerscheZahl: not another OoC please
 Hjax: was ooc pretty rng at the end?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: top4 on a coinflip
 Hjax: i messed around with it for like a day, got bored and stopped 
 Hjax: wasnt a big fan of that game
 AntiSquid: me neither
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard</a>they changed order a few times during recalc
 Hjax: do you think this game will end up the same euler? 
 wlesavo: kovi droped from 1st to 4
 wlesavo: in ooc recalc i mean
 Hjax: i think in utg the top bots were pretty consistent vs weaker bots 
 AntiSquid: there was some RPS in there too at the top 
 wlesavo: and with this game i feel like i cant improve anymore, most of my ideas broke my bot
 AntiSquid: certain people countered each other
 Hjax: this is true, i had a better winrate against karliso than teccles did 
 Hjax: also a pretty google winrate against teccles 
 Hjax: good*
 wlesavo: had to go back on 1.5 days of chnges, to go back at 100 at least
 kovi: btw
 kovi:  	pb4 	33.93 	0% [%, 20%] 	0 / 17 / 0
 njaber: I'm starting to wonder is iterating through a list that can sometimes contain all cells of the maze isn't slower then simply iterating through indexes and checking a 2D array at this index :thinking:
 Hjax: whats that
 AntiSquid: from ooc&#160;?
 kovi: that how recalc ended for me
 wlesavo: ooc wr i guess
 Hjax: oh i see
 Hjax: tragic
 cegprakash: njaber early game 2D array is better late game list is better :D
 cegprakash: but I use 2D array :D
 njaber: i'm not talking about pellets btw
 njaber: I'm talking about my projection algorithm that generates possible enemy paths/positions up to N turns ahead
 njaber: I've set it to 20 rn but it's too slow, I hopped to optimize it to get as much turns in a as possible
 njaber: hoped*
 MattSOrme: damn, kovi is crushing... what happened?
 AntiSquid: well why not use c++ then if you need more speed njaber
 njaber: rn I'm doing list + map for each turn, but I'm wondering if the upside of using the list for turns where there aren't a lot of possibilities is worth the downside of assigning to it on turns with a lot of them
 njaber: AntiSquid how much faster is optimized c++ compared to optimized c#?
 eulerscheZahl: factor 2
 AntiSquid: stupidly much 
 njaber: Because it will take a long time form me to convert 1900 lines of code to c++, and since I'm using enumerable functions a lot I think there's going to be a lot of refactoring needed
 AntiSquid: do it after contest i guess
 njaber: Oh yeah because the game stays open after contest right?
 eulerscheZahl: or never
 eulerscheZahl: it will quickly return to the multiplayer section
 AntiSquid: did everyone drop in rank, gold seems oddly bigger and harder Q_Q
 wlesavo: resubs are more random
 cegprakash: I got dropped
 cegprakash: :D
 Kukiss: Yup, but I guess it is not possible that Everybody dropped with us :D
 AntiSquid: you were never that high ceg
 dbf: AntiSquid I moved 50-&gt;130 during the night, so please submit tomorrow to push legend bot to place #135
 Icebox: I doubt you'd get legend even in top 50
 Icebox: I'm guessing it's gonna be top 20-40 that are gonna get promoted initially
 AntiSquid: not sure what you mean by that dbf
 AntiSquid: 40&#160;? so generous&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 20-40? that number is too high
 Icebox: :D
 eulerscheZahl: more like 10-15
 Icebox: people will join gold till tomoroow
 AntiSquid: yes was thinking 10-15 too
 eulerscheZahl: you should play more often Icebox
 Icebox: you should end in top 10-15 more often 
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 Icebox: :D
 eulerscheZahl: usually it's looking good till the last weekend hits me hard
 AntiSquid: it's like friday every bot comes out of hiding to promote
 Hjax: only 10-15 in legend? even given how big this competition is
 Hjax: id expect like 50 
 eulerscheZahl: legend is a fixed number, not a percentage
 Hjax: interesting 
 njaber: Fixed number at all times? or only the original ranking up?
 eulerscheZahl: for the boss placement
 Hjax: original ranking
 Hjax: utg legend was about 100 people by the end 
 eulerscheZahl: heuristic games tend to have larger legend leagues
 eulerscheZahl: simulations games like mean max as small
 eulerscheZahl: are small*
 Hjax: because its easier to hard counter the boss?
 eulerscheZahl: because more people are capable to improve their bots
 Hjax: true, sim is hard 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463750541">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463750541</a>that scissors at frame 46. just why?!
 eulerscheZahl: and then even chasing me with it
 njaber: It couldn't see your pack
 njaber: pac*
 cegprakash: Hjax 3 days to get it right :D
 NapTown: suicidal pac
 njaber: tho he could have deduced the pac type from the fact he was bouncing
 Hjax: maybe he thought youd switch paper
 Hjax: and was trying to be clever
 eulerscheZahl: but what about the chasing turn after? :rofl:
 Hjax: brave pac
 njaber: chased you before seeing you
 Hjax: thats not true 
 njaber: His bot probably doesn't track pac
 Hjax: hes rank 6 in gold 
 njaber: But it's true the more I look the less it makes sens
 Hjax: pretty sure he does lol 
 CatchinAsteroids: Do you guys know where to find completed assignments?
 njaber: Oh well then it make 0 sens to me
 njaber: Maybe it's an NN/GC that learned to do that?
 njaber: I mean GA
 eulerscheZahl: complete assignments for what?
 CatchinAsteroids: like where to view all of the puzzles we've completed

 elderlybeginner: how to turn off autosuggestions?
 elderlybeginner: in editor
 Doju: How many submissions do you guys have?
 Kukiss: elderlybeginner I don't exactly but you can open comman pallete with F1, maybe you can find it there
 Doju: i've got 88 xD
 Kukiss: command*
 Hjax: 28 submissions 
 AntiSquid: select &gt; prefer to not say
 Doju: Oh right, you're playing the captcha game all day long :D
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: only when i tab to codingame
 eulerscheZahl: 76
 AntiSquid: tested stuff and submits take aeons, so have plenty of time to watch random stuff on amazon/netflix
 alinde2: Well, BFS and a couple of ifs got me to silver, anyone got a suggestion what to try next?
 Doju: alinde2 I think collaboration is very important
 Ramzel: Lol I m winning in ide with silver boss but when i submit i m losing so often
 AntiSquid: implement the perfect search algo alinde2
 EvModder: i do 0 collaboration and i'm got to gold, but i do a lot of work elsewhere
 Doju: ^ winning strategy
 Doju: how do you do 0 collaboration?
 EvModder: perfect search algo yes 
 Doju: do all of your pacs always go for the same pellet? :D
 EvModder: well, i avoid dead ends and other pacs, so I guess that counts
 Doju: that counts
 Doju: that definitely counts
 EvModder: no, it has a means of preventing that, heuristically
 EvModder: alright
 ntroPi: avoiding others of your own pacs is cooperation
 njaber: what do you mean perfect search algo, it's a joke or is this really something I never  heard of?
 alinde2: I hope its a joke...
 Doju: a perfect search algo goes through every possible path, i'd say
 Doju: till the game ends
 SyrusSilverkin: Rookie question: how do I import a module here? I'm trying to use `Math.sqrt`...
 Hjax: yeah id define perfect search as minimax with infinite depth 
 njaber: Yeah that's what  I though
 Doju: Hjax yeah that
 Hjax: good luck minimaxing to the end of the game in 50 ms 
 Doju: SyrusSilverkin python?
 SyrusSilverkin: Sorry, JS
 EvModder: perhaps a min-max ai would be perfect
 Doju: you won't get very far with that
 Doju: like literally
 Doju: in time
 EvModder: i know, only speaking theoretically
 Adnmaster: what is minmax?
 Doju: isn't minimax technically the only perfect one?
 njaber: There is no perfect search algo anyway in this game since at some point you must bet on the opponents past or future moves to make the "perfect choice"
 EvModder: google it, famous game algo&#160;:)
 EvModder: technically yes
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax</a>
 EvModder: idk, it might actually be semi-doable for this game impo
 SyrusSilverkin: Minimax can be sped up with alpha-beta pruning if you decide to go down that route.
 Hjax: theres a proof somewhere that mcts converges to minimax given enough time 
 Doju: oh huh...
 Hjax: so mcts is also perfect 
 Doju: that's interesting
 Zenoscave: SyrusSilverkin Alpha beta still isn't enough to go to end depth
 njaber: Still doesn't resolve incomplete info and betting on the next enemy move
 alinde2: But, we don't know where the enemy pacs are and which have been eaten, so thats not really gonna go far?..
 Doju: maybe i should take a look at the online ai introductory course that i took again
 Doju: btw awesome course
 Hjax: this isnt a good game for minimax or mcts 
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.elementsofai.com/">https://www.elementsofai.com/</a>
 RockyMullet: my first turn only sim got me from 120th to 85th, I'm happy :D
 Doju: no coding but theory
 SyrusSilverkin: No, not for this game, but you might be able to get a few levels deeper, especially if you make it towards the end game where there are significantly fewer viable states.
 Doju: if you're a beginner
 Hjax: my bot is currently doing something monte carlo esque though 
 EvModder: (5*[5,9])^depth for min max, for your moves along. enemy is worse, because you have to min-max for what you can't see
 EvModder: alone*
 Doju: err
 AntiSquid: RockyMullet that's not much, my bot is near yours in rank just to give you a good point of reference
 AntiSquid: (my bot isn't very good)
 Doju: if you go the theoretical route why don't you minimax the opponet too..?
 Doju: opponent*
 Doju: or there is not other version
 Doju: really
 EvModder: don't down talk your bot antisquid, it's given me quite a bit of trouble&#160;:'D
 EvModder: i played so many IDE games against it lol
 Hjax: AntiSquids bot beats me somewhat often as well 
 Icebox: minmax won't work here
 RockyMullet: AntiSquid yeah but at least it was better lol
 Doju: unless you define the game as get all pellets in the least amount of time and the opponent doesn't exist
 AntiSquid: ya which is funny because i rely on 2 bugs to cause odd behaviour and somehow magically win
 RockyMullet: how many times I did a search algo that ended up being worse than my heuristic lol
 AntiSquid: if you look at how it plays you will see it's bugged
 Doju: everybody's bot just runs on magic
 EvModder: yes, magic powers everything
 RockyMullet: yeah werent you like way higher earlier&#160;? AntiSquid
 RockyMullet: you broke something&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no, more like fixing it drops my rank
 Hjax: story of my life 
 EvModder: i'm about to submit, fingers crossed i don't drop a mile lol
 AntiSquid: one of the bugs: it occasionally selects index -1 as a target ...
 Hjax: @EvModder i smell timeouts 
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463818006">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463818006</a>
 RockyMullet: yeah exactly why im happy I improved, too many time 2 days of coding lead to a worse bot lol
 AntiSquid: the other bug is related to the scoring, i deducts score for one thing it should actually increase the score T_T
 AntiSquid: so basically i don't know how it works anymore
 RockyMullet: if you know about those bugs, why not fix them&#160;?
 AntiSquid: because it lowers my rank @_@
 RockyMullet: oh rip
 AntiSquid: by a 100 or so even
 Ramzel: When bugs makes yours rank higher ;D
 RockyMullet: you got the desise of "my bugs make it better"
 Ramzel: :D *
 RockyMullet: makes it impossible to tweak lol
 AntiSquid: i am adding new features on top of it 
 Ramzel: Ouch 
 Ramzel: I found stiupid bug
 AntiSquid: should be fun
 Hjax: got to pull the bandaid and get out of your local maxima 
 RockyMullet: fettuccine over the spagethi
 Hjax: fix the bugs, add new features, make it better than it ever was 
 EvModder: oh i've had bugs like that
 AntiSquid: trying to replace the scoring function as a first step
 EvModder: I patched them 2 days, and my rank dropped, and i've only now finally restored it
 EvModder: i still don't know why the bugs helped lol
 Nerchio: hello 
 Nerchio: how is your tracking antisquid
 AntiSquid: first step to sentience is a bug, humans don't have perfect logic, so my bot is sentient, do you want me to kill it? AutomatonNN change my mind
 AutomatonNN: where?
 Zenoscave: False syllogism
 AntiSquid: do you have tracking nerchio? what makes you think i have&#160;?
 Nerchio: i dont have it just asking
 Nerchio: lost motivation because of it :D
 RockyMullet: mine is pretty dumb and I dont do much with it..., its probably my next step, to improve it
 AntiSquid: my tracking is just unrefined i guess
 Derthek: For c# users. Can I use newtonsoft json in the game?
 Nerchio: its different from ooc
 EvModder: how do i use the seed for a game to replay it?
 Nerchio: not a fan of implementing tracking here there is so many weird cases to consider
 Nerchio: but its neccessary for the top i think
 cegprakash: omg kovi now coin has counter to counter of bump counter
 cegprakash: what a legend
 njaber: Doing a for loop is faster then mapping a function to the array right?
 AntiSquid: i have a good idea for tracking, but it's a bit long winded Nerchio
 AntiSquid: maybe even incomplete
 cegprakash: I've become a big fanboy ofkovi
 Derthek: For c# users. Can I use newtonsoft json in the game?
 AntiSquid: ask for a kovi pillow cegprakash
 RockyMullet: make it a group buy
 njaber: I've done most of the hard work for tracking, still got a few features to implement but those are easy and I've got my actually bot to work on, I'll finish the tracking after I'm happy with my bot's decision making
 EvModder: can i re-create a game if i have the seed?
 AntiSquid: yes&#160;?
 njaber: Unless one of the bots is non-deterministic
 AntiSquid: first click cog wheel (settings) &gt; select expert mode then mid of screen select options, mangual, input seed
 EvModder: mind telling me how?
 EvModder: oh
 EvModder: ty
 AntiSquid: RockyMullet since you have a sim, why didnt you try to go higher depth?
 eulerscheZahl: Derthek no you can't
 Derthek: Thanks :D
 Hjax: only if both bots are deterministic 
 Hjax: oops scroll 
 Enknable: just a quick question..theres a bug where we get input for enemy bots we cant see, right?
 RockyMullet: AntiSquid I have a pretty specific sim made for first turn
 RockyMullet: so I dont actually have a sim for the whole game, so thats probably what I should do, make a dumb very of my sim for each turn
 eulerscheZahl: seems extremely unlikely Enknable
 njaber: Enknableif those are dead pacs and you're in Silver it's not a bug
 EvModder: Enknable those might be dead bots
 Enknable: no, im getting the position of an enemy pac on the 2nd turn, even though its on the other side of a wall
 AntiSquid: ah i get now what you have RockyMullet, didn't add that yet to mine
 eulerscheZahl: wrapping around?
 njaber: Replay?
 Enknable: ohh thats a good point, eulerscheZahl
 njaber: nice thinking
 AntiSquid: might be a hard legend and it's only been a week&#160;:/
 RockyMullet: yeah once my initial sim is done, my bot is back to pure dumbness
 eulerscheZahl: legend isn't supposed to be easy
 eulerscheZahl: and you said you like challenging bosses
 AntiSquid: relative to other contests i mean
 Hjax: my goal for UTG was top 20 (for the tshirt) i think my goal now is just get legend 
 njaber: TIL doing tons of unnecessary iterations and value checks on array is more then 10 times more efficient then keeping available values in a list
 njaber: Wait no this might just be me not having implemented this correctly
 njaber: I'm holding back that statement
 njaber: Ok no it's "only" 2-3 times faster
 njaber: Still worth the hour of refactoring
 Doju: whhat
 Doju: o.o
 njaber: I should mention this is in c#
 foxbel: hey
 foxbel: go minecraft
 Lopear: go
 Lopear: what version
 Lopear: &amp;
 Lopear:&#160;?
 AntiSquid:&#160;? @_@ this is contest chat
 AntiSquid: click #minecraft_chat if you want minecraft
 Csipcsirip: some1 please link me seed with pellet spawned next to a pacman :D 
 Csipcsirip: *big pellet
 Counterbalance: I must be doing something seriously wrong if the same bot gets #120 on the first submit and #320 on the second..
 cegprakash: Counterbalance yes we all are :D
 AntiSquid: the bots are of similar strength Counterbalance
 cegprakash: still in gold and we are working with guesses
 AntiSquid: some fluctuate less
 RockyMullet: beat kovi in 22 turn in his last submit :P<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463828773">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463828773</a>

 RockyMullet: im still happy hehe, this specific game was probably really impacted by my sim
 AntiSquid: the new guy is at 71% win rate
 Doju: damn that's good
 Doju: nobody is even close
 RockyMullet: looks like I reached depth 18
 cegprakash: I think eulerscheZahl is doing MCTS :D

 njaber: Once again I'm too verbose
 njaber: Should learn to write short messages
 AntiSquid: i think second one is a bit faster
 njaber: ok thanks
 AntiSquid: no wait ... 
 ZarthaxX: njaber but you are not comparing var on there
 ZarthaxX: not the same expression
 njaber: it's always more then 0, it's just to make it part of the if
 ZarthaxX: ah
 AntiSquid: can't you use a profile njaber&#160;?
 dbf: njaber have a look at godbolt where you can see compiler output, it is better than guessing.
 dbf: or just profile it
 AntiSquid: profiler *
 AntiSquid: and tell me if i guessed correctly
 njaber: I never used a profiler and I'm too lazy to set one up just for that, I'll just use the C# stopwatch
 cegprakash: when njaber comes to gold we are all screwed
 cegprakash: I'd love to see his opponent prediction
 njaber: s/when/if
 cegprakash: njaber submit plz&#160;:'(
 njaber: I hope I have enough time to finish
 njaber: what I have now isn't submitable, it's barley wood1 level

 cegprakash: u know bumping?
 Quidome: o, wow, you are right&#160;:)
 Quidome: tricky
 Doju: that's next meta strats
 Doju: protect your pacs by blocking them from the other side
 cegprakash: Doju and waste turns rofl
 cegprakash: if creating meta is an art then kovi is the picasso of i
 cegprakash: *it
 cnn: Nope, what's bumping&#160;?
 cegprakash: bumping = colliding
 Doju: i think there's one veryy specific case where that would be useful
 Doju: if an enemy is going into a dead end
 cegprakash: when u collide accidentally then there is some counter to it
 cegprakash: but then kovi has a counter to that counter
 Doju: you follow them but are countered and have cd
 cegprakash: kovi had other ideas
 cegprakash: :D
 Doju: in that case it'd be beneficial to have another pac protecting you
 cnn: I stil lhave no idea what that means :D
 cnn: Do you have a replay&#160;?
 Hjax: kovi didnt play utg 
 RockyMullet: my bot doesnt handle collision from collisions, it sometimes lead to really bad games :grimacing:
 Hjax: the trendsetter there was the_duck 
 Jay_Jayjay: Does anyone have parameterfiddler working?
 cegprakash: RockyMullet u mean chain collisions?
 RockyMullet: yah
 cegprakash: I don't have it too
 cegprakash: don't think it's worth it 
 alinde2: Sprinkle in some Math.random() to fix that.
 RockyMullet: like if my pac collide with an enemy which leads to my other pac to collide with my pac that is still there because of the collision
 Enknable: night at the roxbury attack?
 NapTown: lol
 AntiSquid: @cnn that looks like something AutomatonNN would say
 AutomatonNN: update your age
 njaber: AntiSquid I'm not sure the results are accurate but if they are you were wrong on the optimization thing, the other choice was faster, it's not very noticable though
 AntiSquid: i see, thx for letting me know
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl is at #2
 eulerscheZahl: random luck
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: nice parking eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: *parking spot
 eulerscheZahl: valgrowth finished the submit at #1, is at 11 nowthe leaderboard isn't very reliable
 Hjax: i blame kovi 
 eulerscheZahl: but my tracking can be improved. not sure if i will instantly see it on submit but will make my bot better for sure
 kovi: i blame overtraining
 eulerscheZahl: but i'll leave that for tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: overtraining against whom?
 kovi: self
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even bother setting that up this time
 dbf: I moved 130 -&gt; 70 in couple of hours without any changes, so not sure if I submit now for #100 - is it better or not&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no way to tell. the random aspect is strong
 eulerscheZahl: 1 bad collision at a corner and it's even hard for a top bot to win vs a mediocre one
 Quidome: ppff, nr 2 in silver...
 Quidome: waiting to get pushed&#160;:)
 Quidome: or not&#160;:(
 Illedan: The difference in rank is VERY small
 jjdb210: Any chance at Legend League we'll be getting the ability to see around corners when at the corner?
 Illedan: No chance.
 AntiSquid: you aren't even gold jjdb210
 jjdb210: That's just a matter of time to code...  :-)
 AntiSquid: or being an alt
 Doju: :D
 AndrewLaneX: Is there a way to see the question of a clash after submitting? 
 NickStahl: 2nd in bronze.... maybe I can finally go to silver with my simple heuristics :D
 alinde2: Oh my, I just realised that a move command has to be &gt;=2 away or the speed bonus doesn't apply.
 Doju: yeah you can
 Doju: yup alinde2 it's a bit of a PITA
 alinde2: I was wondering why my pacs were slower, this changes everything.
 cegprakash: go go NickStahl
 Quidome: yes!! made it :D
 NickStahl: cegprakash tx. Still second&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I wouldn't resubmit if I were u nicola
 cegprakash: NickStahl*
 NickStahl: cegprakash I won't, even if I have to wait until tomorrow&#160;:)
 cegprakash: gratz eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: E1
 cegprakash: #1
 Quidome: I was in the same situation and just pushed to the next legeau after 45 minutes
 NickStahl: Question... I do BFS to find my path... but the order in which i linked my nodes might be different from the game in case there are two routes to the same cell with same amount of steps... Does anyone know in which order the game does this?
 cegprakash: how much difference NickStahl
 NickStahl: ceg 30.92 (boss) vs 30.46 (me)
 cegprakash: no NickStahl u need to check the referee
 Doju: NickStahl if ypu want to make sure you can just take a step on your own path
 cegprakash: NickStahl then wait
 NickStahl: Doju, that's what I did, but thought that this was not always sufficient, I think it is though.. Need to think this trough&#160;:)
 Doju: alright
 alinde2: Welp, with me figuring out that a move has to be 2 away, I went from 800 Silver to 95 silver.
 Doju: haha
 Doju: nice
 NickStahl: alinde2, nice, I should implement that&#160;:)
 Doju: do you not have that?!
 NickStahl: well, not if my closest pellet is one step away
 Doju: D:
 NickStahl: I know&#160;:) Focused on other stuff first. Amount of pellets I get in a game was hardly the issue, needed to make sure that I stopped dying first&#160;:)
 Doju: gotcha
 Doju: I've been spending so much of my time on this that i'm surprised that i haven't had any pac-man dreams xD
 muy31: im so done... i just keep finding random bugs that hadnt existed before in my code
 NickStahl: I remember my first time... Coders of the Caribbean... I even worked on my bot during work.
 Doju: :D
 Doju: this is my first time
 NickStahl: I know, I follow the chat a lot&#160;:)
 Hjax: ha kovi resubmitted and lost to me 
 Doju: :p
 Doju: :o nice Hjax
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463892040">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463892040</a> my bot is finding the pellet, but isnt going to it frames 31 to end
 Doju: which one's better? this one? no, this one
 Doju: no, the other one
 muy31: i dont know why...
 NickStahl: Doju, you had experience in AI related coding? Or are you going full heuristics?
 Doju: I dont have experience in ai related coding. I only took an introductory online course that had 0 coding in it. Soo full heuristics, NickStahl
 NapTown: muy21 it's going between 15-11 and 17-11, back and forth
 Quidome: muy31 you are targetting the right one, moe to the right then targetting the left one
 Doju: although it's debatable at which point complicated heuristics become ai
 muy31: i know that obviously but i dont know why...
 NickStahl: Doju ok, nice going then!
 Quidome: O, well, yes, your targetting system is not known to us :P
 muy31: given the fact that i am using a score map, what i know to be true is better than what i dint
 muy31: dont
 muy31: so why?
 Quidome: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Jerzy: how can i got sample cod for bronze league
 Jerzy:&#160;??
 Jerzy: nevermind
 cegprakash: is it normal to add 5 bugs when u add 1 feature or is it just me?
 Hjax: need to add at least 6 bugs per feature :P 
 Jerzy: yeah it is
 Doju: cegprakash i add 5 bugs per line
 NickStahl: Silver!&#160;:)
 NickStahl: Waited it out
 Doju: grats NickStahl
 MarekM: welcome
 cegprakash: yayya NickStahl
 HKG: ids are unique? 
 cegprakash: Doju lol
 Jerzy: pacs id are uniique HKG
 cegprakash: I don't know how ppl hire me in jobs I am doing mistakes on curly braces
 cegprakash: :D
 NickStahl: Enough for today. Back again tomorrow!
 cegprakash: night NickStahl
 NickStahl: tx for the support&#160;:)
 HKG: then no idea why it gives me two pacs with same ids 🤔
 Doju: HKG own and enemy pacs have the same ids
 NapTown: one is an enemy?
 Crispy23: Opponent's ID?
 muy31: what i did was just to add 5 to enemy ids
 muy31: to differentiate
 Doju: hahah, now that schools are closed, the principal and vice-principal are doing homeroom on every thursday via the fantastic platform that is youtube
 Doju: it's absolutely hilarious
 faresnaoui: ramadan mukarak evevrybody
 Krizai: 6th in silver. So close.....
 Counterbalance: hm so everyone's submitting. Wins against top don't help if they're still at the bottom, and losses against top who just submitted keep the bot from climbing.. it's like quicksand
 NapTown: these are the times we live in
 AntiSquid: play the contest faresnaoui <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>

 Kukiss: should have put a code separately
 Kukiss: any help is appreciated, I must be doing sth very dumb there&#160;:/
 Enknable: self.x =x, etc?
 Enknable: oops..
 Enknable: self.x = x, self.y =y, ..?
 Doju: no that's not it
 Doju: oh wait
 Kukiss: Nevermind -.-    I was putting variables when defining a function it could not work..
 Kukiss: :flushed:
 Doju: ah yes
 Doju: if you do that then it uses the variables as defaults when no others were specified in the function call
 Kukiss: I was doing things too fast :Dwanted to define a method and run it
 Doju: :p
 drykberg: can i put wood 1 on my resume? ^^
 Doju: just put in "professional programmer with experience in AI"
 [Csongor]: (:
 drykberg: seasoned professional in methods of applied machine learning, specialised in natural language processing
 drykberg: thats what i have now
 drykberg: think they will know? ^^
 drykberg: are there any tutorials you guys can recommend to learn how to build a map, calculate distances, cost and paths etc?
 Doju: Hmm
 Doju: well, probably the easiest yet the best pathfinding for a grid like this is BFS
 Doju: i just looked at the wikipedia page
 Doju: maybe peeked at some implementations
 Doju: then implemented it and debugged for a million hours
 Doju: better learning experience if you do it yourself :p
 drykberg: yes thats why i am here
 drykberg: although, it is quite addictive
 Doju: oh talk about addictive
 Doju: i've been coding like 14 hours per day since the contest started
 drykberg: lol
 drykberg: i got onboard yesterday and coded through the night 12 hours straight 
 drykberg: no clue about anything
 Doju: cool
 Doju: how much programming have you done before?
 Doju: oh hello 700 line mark
 njaber: only 700 after 14 hours per day?
 Doju: yup, honestly most of that has been fixing bugs prolly
 Lydericsensei: Hello World. I've just started codingame, I'm in coders strike back. I'm winning against the Boss &amp; don't fit any of the "lost condition" yet I'm not moving up a level (i'm in bronze1) any ideas?
 Doju: and i've done a lot of things that i've never done before so they're taking some extra time
 njaber: I've been doing 90% things i've never done before and I'd say 70% of my time is spent debbuging yet I'm at 1700 lines
 Doju: huh
 Doju: maybe we have a different style?
 Doju: or maybe you just have more stuff
 njaber: Yeah idk
 njaber: Or maybe I just space my code out more XD
 darkhorse64: Lydericsensei: did you submit your bot&#160;?
 njaber: I guess I kinda limit myself to ~100 characters per line so this might affect the length of my code quite a bit
 njaber: I hate that the tilde display as a minus here
 Doju: i do a lot of list comprehensions
 Doju: those tighten code up a lot
 HKG: code shouldn't be longer than 80 lines imo
 Lydericsensei: Yes I did submit. Many times
 Doju: HKG hmm :D
 Doju: 80 lines?
 Doju: or do you mean 80 chars
 HKG: oh. 
 HKG: just realised 
 njaber: 80 1000 character lines I guess?
 HKG: 80 columns, right xD
 njaber: Xd yeah that I can understand
 HKG: somehow my brain read lines as columns 
 Doju: I just pasted all of my code in to microsoft word
 Doju: this is the height of my coding career
 cegprakash: euler still has timeouts
 cegprakash: and he is #3
 darkhorse64: If your ranking is not above the boss, you do not get promoted
 njaber: I have a hard time making my code both less then 80 characters and properlly formatted/readable, especially in languages with lots of nested blocks like C#
 Doju: 25000 chars on 700 ines
 Lydericsensei: oh
 Lydericsensei: you not only needs to beat the boss 1v1 but then beat its ranking?
 Doju: of which like 8k are tabs
 Lydericsensei: Got it
 Lydericsensei: thank you for clearing that up
 Doju: yup lydericsensei
 Kukiss: also Lydericsenei join the currently open contest. It is running for next 3 days and almost all conversation here is about it -&gt; Spring Challange 2020
 Lydericsensei: will check it out
 Lydericsensei: ty
 darkhorse64: submitting runs a number of battles against other people's bots and the boss. You get a raking frolm these battles. At the end of the run, your ranking must be above the boss for promotion
 njaber: 45854 characters, 10676 blanck characters
 Lydericsensei: so I do need to wait a while
 njaber: Doju what language btw?
 Doju: my lines are more character-dense than yours then
 Doju: python
 Lydericsensei: that's why. I'm always impatient and closing games against other ppl lol
 Doju: must be my stupid variable names
 Kukiss: When you submit your code and go to "Last battles" you will see the progress of battles done in&#160;%
 njaber: Well it's understandable that python code is shorter then C# code also
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: oh im dumb
 Doju: i was wondering why my bfs didnt work
 Doju: apparently i put in "cell is empty" as an exit criteria
 njaber: most of my bugs come from me pasting part of my code elsewhere and forgetting to change some part of it
 Doju: most of mine come from forgetting the second = in comparisons :D
 Doju: and the second largest category come from my sleep deprived brain
 njaber: ^
 Doju: i still haven't figured out a smart way to not make my pacs crash
 Doju: like yes i know the idea
 Doju: just put some flags on the existing target cells and dont go to those
 Doju: but the thing that i use to pick a further cell to utilize speed will totally break that
 njaber: I assign pellets to pacs before assigning pacs to pellets, this usually helps, tho there are still some corner cases
 Doju: hm
 Doju: that's smart
 Doju: i was thinking of doing something like test if they have the same target
 Doju: if they do, figure out which one should get it
 Doju: and let the other ones decide again but with that cell excluded
 njaber: I don't like to hardcode exceptions, I like to have my logics include as broad of situations as possible
 Doju: that's reasonable
 Doju: although i need to do something similar anyways soon
 njaber: If you do that your pac will probably select a cell that is on the other side of the other pac
 Doju: umm
 Doju: not if i dont let them pathfind through the existing target cell
 muy31: that's what i did doju it's semi recursive
 muy31: refind a new cell
 njaber: Right that could work, but you can't use your current BFS so this might get expensive both in time to code and time to execute
 muy31: if there are duplicates
 muy31: no not at all
 Doju: i can use my current bfs
 muy31: i have a working system ive been utilizing
 Doju: i don't have logic hardcoded :P
 njaber: You don't pregen the maps?
 Doju: i do that too
 Doju: but dont actually even use it atm
 Doju: soon im gonna do some fancy stuff and use those
 njaber: Oh so you'll jsut run a normal bfs
 njaber: I guess that could work if not too slow
 Enknable: checking that their next step isnt the same spot when choosing your path has worked for avoid crashing
 Doju: woah what
 Doju: i have such a big winstreak
 Doju: this might actually push me to gold
 Doju: not the blocking prevention
 Doju: but a really minor change in pathfinding
 AlexRSS: Ahh man, I've just got the bare bones of dfs working in the map I copied over to vscode
 AlexRSS: I'm dreading bringing this into CG and seeing what inevitably breaks
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463967364">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463967364</a>

 njaber: muy31
 Doju: rip muy31
 Doju: alright imma go for today
 Doju: cya everybody
 njaber: cya

 adamjhawley: I just did my first clash and lost wayyy too much time because I couldn't see how to raise an error when all I had to do was print("INVALID")&#160;:((
 thethiny: 3 Days left and I still can't seem to have a good path algorithm
 daffie: same here
 daffie: faced endless problems 
 thethiny: I fixed collisions and fixed stuck and fixed enemy collisions
 thethiny: yet they all go to the same point
 daffie: path system is pretty much the core of this needs to be build around that imo
 HKG: can I read enemy's ability cooldown?
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:yes
 EvModder: yesterday i said i would work on the pathing today.
 EvModder: ....i feel like it's time for some combat upgrades
 EvModder: lol
 Zenoscave: How do you keep from blind corner collisions
 Zenoscave: Track enemy possible?
 cegprakash: I use a BFS inside my eval and it runs the same speed as pacsxwxh
 cegprakash: I thought it would run pacs times faster
 Zenoscave: do you iterate over all pacs?
 cegprakash: only closest pellet
 cegprakash: for each pac
 Zenoscave: which on average is pacs x w x h / 2
 Zenoscave: so linear to the same idea
 cegprakash: nopes
 EvModder: i dont track it at all and i die a lot because of it lol
 cegprakash: my BFS is wxh
 njaber: Nice, got stuck 30mn on a + instead of a minus
 njaber: Wait no this doesn't fix it
 AlexRSS: Hmm
 AlexRSS: Anyone have any ideas what could be causing a random phantom positional argument?
 AlexRSS: self.mapcheckinit(self.x, self.y)
 AlexRSS: self.x and self.y are both ints
 AlexRSS: TypeError: mapcheckinit() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
 Braykin08: Some languague adds "this" as a parameter during compilation which adds 1 to the argument count
 AlexRSS: Huh
 Braykin08: Meaning, you may want to substract one
 lxnn: is mapcheckinit a classmethod?
 AlexRSS: I added an extra variable so I could print it and somehow the object is adding itself as an argument
 AlexRSS: Yeah
 lxnn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod</a>
 AlexRSS: Wait no, got confused with terminology there
 AlexRSS: Maybe?
 lxnn: sorry, i assumed python, right?
 AlexRSS: It's a function within a class
 AlexRSS: Python 3 yeah
 AlexRSS: Defined as  def mapcheckinit(x, y):
 Icebox: just paste the piece of code here
 AlexRSS: self.mapcheckinit(self.x, self.y)
 AlexRSS: ...
 AlexRSS: def mapcheckinit(x, y, z): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f547569b-513a-460b-9aa4-3054f11e8b30">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f547569b-513a-460b-9aa4-3054f11e8b30</a>
 AlexRSS: AGH
 AlexRSS: Just figured it
 Icebox: np
 AlexRSS: Forgot to include self
 Icebox: :D
 lxnn: well done :D
 thethiny: guys what are your best heuristics?
 thethiny: I'm tryna find one
 Icebox: if cx == 0:
 thethiny: but don't seem able to
 Icebox: unless I'm missing something that looks weird
 cegprakash: 1 if condition reduces my simulations by 4 times lolol
 Icebox: do you add a border around the map AlexRSS?
 AlexRSS: I haven't done no, I just worked it in to allow looping
 Icebox: shouldn't it be if cx == -1: cx = width -1?
 Icebox: cause 0 is a valid coordinate
 AlexRSS: (Haven't actually got this working for a run in the IDE yet, but I had it working on one map in vscode
 AlexRSS: Umm one sec let me look
 AlexRSS: Right you are!
 Icebox:&#160;:)
 AlexRSS: Thanks&#160;:-)
 Icebox: Also a very general tip, probably too late to rewrite your code now and that's fine, but I'd advise against using globals
 Icebox: like 
 Icebox: ever
 NinjaDoggy: meh i disagree&#160;:)
 Icebox: I'm always open for counterpoints
 Icebox: do you have any good uses for globals?
 NinjaDoggy: sure
 NinjaDoggy: width,height,maze
 lxnn: they can be fine for small single-threaded procedural programs
 Icebox: appart from the fact that they will destroy your life and take custody of your kids
 Icebox: NinjaDoggy why not make those static variables of your game class?
 NinjaDoggy: because everything in my code might use it
 lxnn: although ideally you'd use only static globals
 Icebox: ^^^^
 lxnn: constant*
 AlexRSS: Yeah, I've limited them where I can
 Icebox: NinjaDoggy well class variables are accessable from anywhere
 Icebox: accessible*
 AlexRSS: It's probably not the most polished though, stuff like that I might go back and try to make better after the time limit is up. 
 NinjaDoggy: true... but typing
 NinjaDoggy: GlobalInfo.width
 NinjaDoggy: is kinda ...
 Icebox: using namespace global;
 NinjaDoggy: ok but now I see your point
 Icebox: nah jk
 Icebox: :D
 Icebox: don't do that
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 lxnn: I think in Python globals aren't too bad because of the way modules work
 EvModder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464031653">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464031653</a>
 njaber: lol, I wonder why you pac was switching between staying in place and moving at the end
 EvModder: gotta fake em out you see
 AlexRSS: :O
 AlexRSS: I have movement!
 EvModder: my pacs are sentient
 Icebox: AntiSquid 2.0
 EvModder: my rank may have dropped from 40 to 140 just now, but my pac iq rose to 200
 AlexRSS: It crashes as soon as the pacs headbutt each other
 AlexRSS: But it's progress
 AlexRSS: Right that seems a good place to go sleep
 AlexRSS: Thanks for the help icebox!
 Icebox: Np :wave: see ya around

 Kukiss: hah, funny game
 thethiny: is it weird that top 20 are using C to code?
 Kellthazar: Jeez I think that a got a nice heuristc now! o.o
 Dav1dS: nope, they are probably doing very expensive simulations that require a very fast language
 thethiny: oh wow
 thethiny: so they're predicting the game basically
 dogankoseoglu: why there are french articles in learn section&#160;?
 struct: CG is a french company
 dogankoseoglu: oh okayy
 dogankoseoglu: they should add language preference for articles
 dogankoseoglu: actually it's not a big deal to simply translate them and put different versions for different languages
 lxnn: I think the articles there are written by users
 lxnn: so it's up to them
 lxnn: whether they want to write a translated version
 dogankoseoglu: yes, some of them
 lxnn: it would be good to be able to filter by language though
 dogankoseoglu: I graduated in 2012 and maybe I wrote total of 500 lines of code
 dogankoseoglu: now I'm trying to catch back
 dogankoseoglu: but it's not easy at 30s
 lxnn: That's true, much less free time
 lxnn: Although there's tonnes of free learning resources out there now, on the bright side
 dogankoseoglu: actually I have lots of free time thanks to covid thing&#160;:)
 dogankoseoglu: at least I can create algorithms I need to study more syntax 
 dogankoseoglu: problem solving part is unforgettable :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: welp, looks like I need to get around to fixing my bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: Instead of precomputing routes between points in the map I'm just going to lazy-load them and cache the result cause doing them all takes more than 1 second
 thethiny: instead of precomputing routes, just have the distances and when u need a route generate it?
 njaber: Yeah getting a route from distance isn't very expensive
 njaber: if you have all the distances that is
 thethiny: you can do it in n, where n is the distance
 thethiny: comparisons are 4n worst case
 BenjaminUrquhart: but why do that when I can just be lazy
 thethiny: it'll save you time
 BenjaminUrquhart: pish posh unused time is wasted time
 thethiny: haha

 Kukiss: but it's a middle of submission, so I am gona fall down probably :x
 BenjaminUrquhart: the ultimate debugging tool: kovi
 cegprakash: I debug with euler
 cegprakash: but he timesout at times
 BenjaminUrquhart: I've successfully timed out
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool
 BenWo: congrats
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh I forgot to reset nodes
 thethiny: guys what is this thing called:
 thethiny: I have 3 choices where each one affects the other. I want to select a specific order that maximizes the score of the 3 choices.
 thethiny: Example
 thethiny: I have -2, +2, *-1
 thethiny: these are 3 choices
 thethiny: I want to know the best order for these 3 
 Braykin08: I personnaly call it a homework
 thethiny: XD
 thethiny: I mean it's either permuations or the other thing
 thethiny: which one is it
 wi_lius: are you talking about permutations (n!) and combinations (n choose k)?
 thethiny: yes but I don;t know which one is for my problem
 thethiny: idk which one to use
 thethiny: basicalyl I want to generate all the possibilities without repetition
 thethiny: and order is important
 wi_lius: then it's a permutation, combinations ignore order
 thethiny: is this the nPr one?
 icecream17: Is it guaranteed that all spaces are pellets?
 thethiny: yes @icecream17
 cegprakash: except your spawn Icebox
 cegprakash: icecream17*
 Icebox: same
 icecream17: Nice. Now i can put the opponents down because of symmetry in turn one, and pellets 100%
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: @wi_lius thanks it was Permuations :D
 Icebox: n!/(n-r)!
 Icebox: woop woop
 Icebox: factorials coming through
 icecream17: New record amount of pellets: 10!
 Icebox: 3628800 is a lot of pellets
 icecream17: Hey, when the opponents are symettrical to us, is each ID directly opposite the other ID? It seems like it but im not sure
 journeyvivek: hi
 icecream17: Is the width always odd?
 Icebox: yes and yes
 Icebox: to both of your questions
 Icebox: the map has to be symetrical and the pathways have to be max 1 width
 Icebox: so that's possible with only odd width maps
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/86e3d28f-de75-4950-9db4-85482d5dfbb4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/86e3d28f-de75-4950-9db4-85482d5dfbb4</a>
 icecream17: AABB        Is symmetrical, width is even
 Drastic_Loontastic: How do you enter debug mode again?
 thethiny: Guys what's the minimum Big pellets count
 thethiny: and what's the maximum?
 thethiny: 4?
 Icebox: icecream17 fair enough, argumentation was wrong, statement remains true tho
 icecream17: thx iceboxconvenient info

 njaber: C# is in Debug mode in IDE but release mode when submitted right? What's the difference in speed?
 VicHofs: no idea @thethiny
 Lydericsensei: Hey world, small question: Why do they male me wait 45min to go in silver league? 
 NinjaDoggy: great question :D
 Flyingkid: Are you head of the boss?
 thethiny: looks so
 thethiny: why do people follow others here, trying to understand this website
 RustyCrown: how would you do a genetic algorithm on here, how would you train it?
 Icebox: if you both follow each other it allows direct messages between you thethiny
 Icebox: but it's mostly used purely out of respect
 Icebox: which works well with the private msg thing
 Icebox: I follow everyone who I aknowledge to be a skilled or engaging coder
 Icebox: basically as a form of respect
 Braykin08: I don't see you following me
 Icebox: if they follow me back (for whatever reason they have) it makes sense that it then allows us to dm each other
 Icebox: I have literally no idea who you are Braykin08 :D
 Braykin08: T'was just a joke :P 
 NinjaDoggy: wait you need to both follow each other to dm? :O
 Icebox: correct NinjaDoggy
 thethiny: @IceBox bbut people can message me even without follow
 thethiny: unless you mean DMs other than Chat
 Icebox: only if you type something in chat
 thethiny: okay, thanks :D
 NinjaDoggy: "I follow everyone who I aknowledge to be a skilled or engaging coder"
 Icebox: :D
 Icebox: Absolutely, one of the OG's
 NinjaDoggy: &lt;3
 ShlOk: Hello World!
 NinjaDoggy: been around so long had to change my status from high school student to college student :P
 NinjaDoggy: bio*
 ShlOk: :joy:
 Icebox: the day will come you'll change your coder status to professional :P
 NinjaDoggy: true! :joy:
 thethiny: My path system finally works
 thethiny: and it's collaborative&#160;:')
 thethiny: I didn't use this emoji
 VicHofs: good stuff @thethiny
 thethiny: I used this 😭
 VicHofs: wym collaborative
 thethiny: It means they determine where to go by discussing with each other
 VicHofs: is that a bad thing
 thethiny: These are tears of joy
 thethiny: 😭😭😭
 VicHofs: oh
 VicHofs: ok
 VicHofs: lol
 thethiny: I used permutations 
 NinjaDoggy: you should have them print messages'
 NinjaDoggy: like "no you go left"
 NinjaDoggy: :P
 VicHofs: how'd you do that?
 VicHofs: just curious @thethiny
 thethiny: I assign 4 points that I consider crucial
 thethiny: say for example the 4 pellets at the start
 thethiny: then I distribute all points to all the pacs
 thethiny: then I ask them to print out their distances
 thethiny: and I pick the shortest distance of them all using
 thethiny: using permutations
 thethiny: since you have a maximum of 60 permutations
 VicHofs: oh I thought about doing that lol
 Icebox: holup
 Icebox: why permutations
 VicHofs: but I thought I wouldn't manage
 Icebox: all pacs take turns simultaneously 
 thethiny: so?
 Icebox: so it should be combinations
 VicHofs: I didn't get that bit either but I won't question
 thethiny: I asked a while ago and they told me what I'm looking for is called permutations so I went with that
 Icebox: imagine you have 2 pacs
 Icebox: and each pac has 4 options
 Icebox: how many possibilities does your alg come up with?
 NinjaDoggy: i think he's treating it as turn based
 thethiny: 4
 NinjaDoggy: and then permuting order
 CodingCarter: anyone here taken AP Computer Science A?
 thethiny: wait let me calculate properly
 thethiny: should be 16
 thethiny: yes 16 possibilities
 Icebox: those are combinations 
 Icebox: thethiny 02:54AMidk which one to usebasicalyl I want to generate all the possibilities without repetitionand order is important
 Icebox: cause order is not important if you have 16
 thethiny: Permute([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) = 
 thethiny: 12 possibilities lol
 thethiny: @IceBox I think that I'm generating combinations using permutations then
 Icebox: :thinking:
 thethiny: since I had to do too many if statements to bring down the number from 120 to 60
 Icebox: what lang?
 thethiny: python3
 Icebox: from itertools import combinations&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 ShlOk: Java is best??
 thethiny: I just compared both of them together
 thethiny: permutations to combinations
 VicHofs: whatever you're best at is best
 thethiny: and no Combinations isn't what I'm looking for
 thethiny: combinations are missing too many combinations that I need
 ShlOk: @vichofs yessss!!
 Icebox: okay
 thethiny: since to me, pellet_id = idx 
 Icebox: so you want
 Icebox: to have all possible moves
 thethiny: yes
 Icebox: from pac A
 Icebox: and then check it
 thethiny: to all 4 points
 thethiny: then Pac B to all 4 points
 Icebox: with all possible moves with B
 Icebox: yeah
 Icebox: I have bad news
 thethiny: yes?
 Icebox: that's neither permutations nor combinations
 thethiny: then what is it then
 Icebox: from itertools import product :D
 Icebox: you're literally multiplying all A options with all B
 NinjaDoggy: yeh combo is a choose b
 NinjaDoggy: perm is 4!
 thethiny: still not it
 thethiny: oh wait
 NinjaDoggy: u want 4^2
 thethiny: okay so from this I can see that
 thethiny: this gives me all posibilities
 thethiny: which is true, but not in order
 Icebox: there is no order tho
 thethiny: I want the possibilities ordered between the pacs
 thethiny: so that if Pac 1 goes to A, pac 2 cannot go to A
 NinjaDoggy: that's ok
 NinjaDoggy: you can resolve them later
 NinjaDoggy: detect that it's a collision and then don't do it
 thethiny: for pellet_idx, player_id in enumerate(perm):
 thethiny: dist = self.get_distance(game.player_pacs[player_id].position, big_pellets[pellet_idx].position)
 Icebox: you're assuming that action A from pac 1 is same as action A from pac 2
 Icebox: just because they are both the 1st option of each pac doesn't mean they can't do it together
 thethiny: pac 1 and 2 can't go to A together
 Icebox: alright, you might be missing the point :D
 thethiny: I understood what you mean
 thethiny: but see the thing is
 thethiny: I'm using the index as my position, not the actual permutations
 thethiny: so for permutations [A B C D] for 2 pacs
 thethiny: I get 
 thethiny: A B, A C, AD ...etc
 thethiny: and from the index of A, which is 0
 thethiny: I assign it to pac 0
 Icebox: so not 16
 thethiny: 12
 Icebox: right, I missed that part
 thethiny: so am I doing it wrong still or is it fine this way?
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464102233">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464102233</a>
 thethiny: first 27 frames
 VicHofs: yo sweet finally not in the 1000ths in bronze lol
 Icebox: that's 2nCr thethiny
 Icebox: still combinations :D
 Icebox: I have no way of knowing if it's correct or not, just pure banter about naming
 Icebox: nCr(2,4)*2 = 12 though
 thethiny: I'm always bad at terminology
 Icebox: nCr(4,2) sorry
 thethiny: okay so it's not 2nCr, it is n x nCr
 thethiny: xD
 Icebox: yeah yeah it's for 2 pacs
 thethiny: if it's 4 pacs it'll change
 thethiny: so it's n^2Cr
 HKTran: sadly my rank now is 53th in bronze league, should I improve my code now or wait guys?
 Icebox: rather
 cegprakash: when u win 2 times in a row against kovi just submit I repeat just submit
 thethiny: well it is doing this in under 1ms and it's working well so idm
 VicHofs: is the boss in silver called inky too?
 VicHofs: what
 Flyingkid: Clyde
 VicHofs: oh nvm
 VicHofs: thethiny's in bronze too
 VicHofs: how do I check battle&#160;% progression
 VicHofs: I still don't know lol
 NinjaDoggy: @HKTran always improve :D
 HKTran: :joy:
 thethiny: in the last battles
 thethiny: it says so
 VicHofs: where tho
 VicHofs: is it the battle with highest index?
 thethiny: under the screen
 thethiny: it will show a percentage
 VicHofs: I swear I don't see it lol

 VicHofs: what
 thethiny: can you see the image I sent?
 VicHofs: I don't see anything where the arrow is pointing lol
 VicHofs: yeah I can but ^^
 thethiny: exactly
 thethiny: if the battle progress not done
 thethiny: it will show there
 VicHofs: oh ok
 VicHofs: so if it's not there it's done
 VicHofs: gotcha
 VicHofs: ty
 thethiny: :D
 VicHofs: -it could just fucking show 100% tho-
 thethiny: ikr
 VicHofs: are battles instant tho
 thethiny: my windows demanded an update
 thethiny: so I did
 thethiny: now demanding again
 thethiny: what is it my wife
 VicHofs: cause right after I submit there's nothing there either
 Kellthazar: 4 loses on 20 games... not bad
 VicHofs: yoo I fell a ton ri[
 VicHofs: rip
 thethiny: youll always fall when u submit
 VicHofs: oh ok
 thethiny: you start from last each time
 VicHofs: got spooked the flip out for a sec there lmao
 thethiny: no worries
 Kellthazar: 6 on 25
 Kellthazar: gogogo
 VicHofs: boa mano Kellthazar
 Kellthazar:&#160;;)
 thethiny: lol you're both Brazilian
 VicHofs: oh no the mask is off
 VicHofs: I mean
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464113350">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464113350</a>
 Kellthazar: What happened in this game
 VicHofs: dance party bro
 thethiny: guys let's say Iam at x = 0, and another me at x = 3. Both need to go to x = 1, but pac 2 has speed. Will they collide, or will Pac 1 arrive first then Pac 2 be blocked at x = 2?
 NinjaDoggy: second one
 Kellthazar: they will collide... and pac 2 will be on x = 2 I guess
 VicHofs: what NinjaDoggy
 VicHofs: said
 mbaros: Is it possible to go back to previous round and continue testing the program there?
 VicHofs: I don't think so
 VicHofs: unless you have its seed and play against the same opponent
 mbaros: damn... that's bad..... 
 VicHofs: why? did you really need to play the same round again?
 Icebox: pfew back in top 100
 mbaros: I want to debug there (on the easy configuration) and improve single instance algorithm
 VicHofs: @Icebox stop flexing -_-
 VicHofs: @mbaros think you're just gonna have to try your luck dude...
 Icebox: after my eternal struggles I'm glad my fix didn't drop me another 1000 places down
 VicHofs: @Icebox lend me some power fam
 Icebox: \o/ take my power
 thethiny: just you wait until I fix my algorithm then I'm placing #1 forever to the point where I automatically spot #1 without playing next contests
 VicHofs: ty I'll give it back in 2 days
 VicHofs: played ya
 Icebox: oof
 VicHofs: @thethiny 3spooky5me
 VicHofs: anyone have any method to avoid pacs trailing behind each other
 VicHofs: that shit's fucking me over big time
 Zenoscave: You could try hungarian assignment algorithm VicHofs
 VicHofs: I have absolutely no clue what that is but thanks
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm</a>
 Zenoscave: Chose targets you want to visit and assign them to different Pacs separately
 VicHofs: hmm
 Zenoscave: just make sure they can't choose the same assignment
 VicHofs: considering I'm a dumdum not sure if I can concile that with the BFS I already have going
 daffie: not sure what pathing you have but I just give the adjacent tiles higher cost and they seem to disperse well enough like this
 thethiny: this won't work btw, the hungarian thing
 thethiny: let's say you're both going to same point, and that point has a point +1 away from it
 thethiny: they will still trail
 Neabfi: Or remove the pellets ahead of the first pac
 thethiny: you can do that
 thethiny: still same issue
 Neabfi: you can do a bfs until there are 2 nodes for a given depth
 thethiny: what if you shared the same path?
 VicHofs: Neabfi that might work
 daffie: if you share the same path then they're doing what they're told to do, why share the path if you don't want them following behind each other
 thethiny: @IceBox Hungarian Algorithm is apparently what I was trying to implement using my perumtations, but I did it wrong :D
 Neabfi: Depending of your ranking but if you’re lazy and not already in gold just simulate random move and take the best, just that will bring you in the first half of silver 
 Neabfi: no need even  to simulate the collisions
 VicHofs: simulate...
 cegprakash: has everyone in top 100 started to track opponents? I'm surprised I'm not even closer to the rank I was yesterday
 cegprakash: I was #20 yesterday on gold and getting to top 100 seem to be a struggle right now :D
 JohnCM: it may just be unlucky submission
 JohnCM: you can try again
 JohnCM: well i have partial tracking of opponent, but not much, as too much tends to make my bot weaker
 Zandy156: in silver today I was going back and forth from rank 30 to 150 to 
 Neabfi: Is it possible to keep track of all possible paths for the opponent and eliminate non possible paths&#160;?  Don’t know if memory wise it is possible 
 Zandy156: bronze I mean
 Neabfi: I guess most people just keep track of a heatmap
 cegprakash: how do I replay under same conditions with same spawn locations?
 cegprakash: random spawn locations is not helpihng
 njaber: Neabfi I do it and I don't elminate all paths already, yet I can still keep track of all possible paths over any number of turns without seeing the opponent
 Neabfi: without any pruning&#160;? :open_mouth:
 njaber: pruning?
 njaber: You mean removing "unlikely" paths?
 Neabfi: yep
 njaber: No I keep all possible paths
 njaber: But I remove them if I'm sure they can't be possible
 Neabfi: ok that is impressive
 njaber: The only thing I might need to optimize a bit because it might timeout in extreme cases is removing the paths when I see the enemy
 JohnCM: my code keeps timing out nowadays
 njaber: I use a trick to regroup as much paths as possible together without losing information
 JohnCM: although it didn't change much from the original
 JohnCM: guess the 50ms became a little shorter, or there is some bug in my code
 Zenoscave: JohnCM it is the second
 Neabfi: @njaber are you also including the speed&#160;?
 JohnCM: lol oh well
 njaber: Yes
 cegprakash: does anyone know to replay under same coonditions with same spawn locations?
 njaber: Actually I made a condition to exit (basically give up) if I see the enemy in a place where I think he cannot be
 Neabfi: ok I have to think then to find a data structure that allows to find very quickly all the path that go through a given cell at a given time
 njaber: cegprakash Settings, expert mode, then next to player selection =&gt; options =&gt; manual, and then set the seed
 njaber: Neabfi the trick is that I don't know all the paths that go through a given cell at a given time, I don't actually know all the pathes an enemy could have taken in a reasonable time, what I can know easily is whether the enemy could have taken any given path I want to know
 Icebox: thethiny are you gonna try implementing it now?
 njaber: So I can check the validity of a path but not list all the valid ones
 Icebox: the algorithm I mean
 Neabfi: But so can you know the probability that a  enemy pac came by this cell in the past&#160;?
 Neabfi: * I mean: The probability for a given pac that he visited a given cell before time t
 njaber: I don't do probablities yet, and I'm still not sure I can implement it how I want with full Bayesian probability, but I have a few ideas and it might be possible. It's definitely possible if I don't update the probabilities in a bayesian way when removing paths
 njaber: It MIGHT be possible with bayesian updating but I'm still not sure
 Neabfi: That opens lots of possibilities by looking at the enemy score
 Neabfi: (and more obviously the big pellet )
 njaber: Yes of course, I don't support thos path removings yet but they will be super easy to add with what I have currently
 njaber: Rn I'm working on an algorithm that uses the same trick I use with enemy tracking for pellet path finding, but I'm still not sure it's possible, I'm doing a lot of theorizing rn. If my theories are right I might have a hyper powerful but, but it's a gamble because I  might also just not have something submitable before then end of the challenge
 njaber: hyper powerful bot*
 Neabfi: yeah I see, you make me hesitate to switch to a full tracking ^^For now I just have a slightly improved heatmap for each pac 
 njaber: It took me a lot of time to implement, so this might not be worth with a little more then 3 days left
 Neabfi: yeah and I don’t have much time until Monday 
 njaber: well I guess most of the time was debbuging so if you're good at avoiding bugs you might have time
 Neabfi: You know other wise I’m still randomly sampling moves lol
 Neabfi: I don’t have any heuristic yet 
 njaber: I don't like random sampling, I like to do things the most deterministically possible, I only resort to probablities when I'm sure I don't have enough info and I need to make a bet
 Neabfi: Yeah it is just the lazy solution :p 
 thethiny: @IceBox I was trying it now, and it is giving me the exact same solution as mine, only in less time
 Icebox: did you actually implement it lol?
 thethiny: no I used scipy
 Icebox: thank god
 Icebox: :D
 thethiny: XD
 thethiny: though importing scipy takes long!
 thethiny: do import count in the first frame?
 Icebox: it's before first input though so it's not counted
 thethiny: oh okay
 thethiny: so anything I do before first input isn't counted?
 Icebox: yes and no
 thethiny: damn
 Icebox: if you put some long ass calculations before reading inputs you still timeout
 thethiny: then how does it know
 thethiny: I mean
 thethiny: currently my first frame is 800ms
 Icebox: on the other hand, anything you want to calculate before reading the first input can be calculated offline and pasted in zipped string
 thethiny: scipy takes about 200 to load
 thethiny: that's true
 cegprakash: 13 wins in first 15 games.. luck or good change :O
 Zenoscave: jinxed 
 cegprakash: everyone in gold got amazing path finding! that's what this submission clearly tells
 Zenoscave: Does anyone do more than BFS?
 cegprakash: depth = 5 rank bottom 30.. depth=20 with same code I'm at #22 now :D
 cegprakash: Zenoscave I just do BFS
 Zenoscave: And which path do you chose? Longest? Shortest? SCore based?
 cegprakash: thousands of BFSs
 cegprakash: shortest ofc
 Zenoscave: What if a slightly longer one has a cherry in it
 Neabfi: @cegprakash depth 20 with pruning&#160;?
 cegprakash: yes pruning
 cegprakash: I assume opponent is stupid
 Neabfi: how many iterations you get at depth 20&#160;?
 cegprakash: around 10K xD
 Neabfi: ok
 Neabfi: I’m sample randomly with depth 11 for now
 cegprakash: I usually test my eval with depth=1 whenever I change something but in this league it seems very much impossible with everyone having a good pathing
 thethiny: just to be sure, 1 million comparisons require 1 million operataions, which is 1 GHz, right?
 Zenoscave: no
 thethiny: 1 MHz?
 Zenoscave: GHz means 1 million cycles per second
 Zenoscave: has nothing to do with ops directly
 thethiny: okay so if I have 1 million operations of O(1)
 Zenoscave: some ops are 1 cycle most are mor
 thethiny: how much approx should it take
 Zenoscave: 5 unicorn lifetimes
 cegprakash: 0.001 seconds thethiny
 cegprakash: in c++
 cegprakash: python can do in 0.01 seconds
 cegprakash: that's 10 times slower
 thethiny: okay so in python
 Zenoscave: give or take 4 unicorn lifetimes
 thethiny: lol
 thethiny: so let's say I'm doing 1 Million Ops, that transltes to MHz not GHz,
 thethiny: cuz GHz is billion
 thethiny: right?
 thethiny: 1 Hz1000 KHz1000000 MHz1000000000 GHz
 thethiny: okay cool
 Zenoscave: there's so much going on under the os and with system calls and locality issues/caching/interrupts there's no way to say X comparisons will take Y time
 thethiny: @zenoscave I understand
 thethiny: I just wanna know if O(n) where n is 1 Million will fit or not
 Zenoscave: 1 million what
 Zenoscave: comparisons?
 thethiny: yes
 Zenoscave: integer constant comparisons to a local variable?
 thethiny: 1 million ofCMP EAX, EBXJE
 Zenoscave: Ah. ok
 thethiny: Thanks BTW 👍🏻
 Zenoscave: There's a processor speed somewhere... I forget what it is hang on
 Zenoscave: They run at about 2Ghz. so 1million CMPS would take about 5ms
 Zenoscave: I think...
 thethiny: suddenly that's costly
 thethiny: damn
 thethiny: looks like I'll have to port my code to python
 thethiny: from*
 fasil: java is best python is worst
 njaber: fasil ofc not if you want perf, don't do java, do c or c++

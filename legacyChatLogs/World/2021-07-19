 prINTint: Thank you all:hugging:
 prINTint: actually i havevno idea bout gui so, i was searching for help
 nulte: They are asking you to do a gui project but didnt teach you gui?
 prINTint: :pensive:
 prINTint: :disappointed_relieved:
 nulte: Which language?
 prINTint: python

 bluefacebaby: how can i print the output in C
 bluefacebaby: my output: "1 2 3 4 "correct output:"1 2 3 4"
 bluefacebaby: how can i fix
 bluefacebaby: my code
 bluefacebaby:&#160;?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: in c++ you would use std::coutBut idk about c
 martinpapa69: it looks like, you print an extra space after the last number. so my guess is, you have a for loop, where you print a number, then a space like printf("%d ", i); right&#160;?
 bluefacebaby: yep
 bluefacebaby: if(i=0;i&lt;n;i++){
 bluefacebaby: printf("%d",i);
 bluefacebaby: if(i!=n-1){
 bluefacebaby: printf(" ");
 bluefacebaby: }
 bluefacebaby: }
 bluefacebaby: can be like this?
 martinpapa69: ye it looks fine. but i think in every game, codingame requires you to print an endline, after you finished printing your output. (thats how it knows, you finished)
 DaNinja: for (int i=0; i&lt;n; i++) if (i==n-1) printf("%d\n", i); else printf("%d ",i);
 bluefacebaby: thanks

 MSmits: getting closer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/570874601">https://www.codingame.com/replay/570874601</a>  My first actual win where I solve sooner. It's like 1 in 20 but still. All this took was another 100x speedup :P
 derjack: :tada:
 LINDI_SHAH: nice dude
 Marchete: how many speedups do you have now?
 Marchete: and always like 10x 100x
 MSmits: millions
 derjack: oO
 MSmits: it's like comparing bubblesort to quicksort on thousands of items
 MSmits: algo is everything here
 MSmits: or mm with ab to mm without ab
 MSmits: well it's literally like the sorting comparison because to get the speed up i use divide and conquer. Split off areas and solve separately
 Ayza: Is there any way i can pick the difficulty of a clash?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: but it's the same difficulty for every player
 LINDI_SHAH: depends on level?
 LINDI_SHAH: the dificulty
 LINDI_SHAH: ff
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: the clashes are considered pretty easy
 MSmits: if you cant solve them, practice on practice puzzles
 MSmits: the idea is that most players will be able to solve every clash and the difference between players is due to speed or codesize
 MSmits: reverse is a bit different
 MSmits: but also a speed coding thing
 LINDI_SHAH: yeah i see
 LINDI_SHAH: alt + 1
 MSmits: I don't clash btw
 LINDI_SHAH: y
 MSmits: It's not fun to me
 derjack: oO
 KiwiTae: Oo
 LINDI_SHAH: oh I see
 LINDI_SHAH: then what's fun 4u here 
 derjack: bots for multiplayer games
 TRKODER: merhaba türk var mı
 MSmits: yes bots, working on this currently:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes</a>
 dbdr: what are you doing on D&amp;B MSmits?
 MSmits: nimstring analysis mostly
 MSmits: the math part of D&amp;B
 MSmits: the more efficient it becomes the closer i get to the rank 1
 MSmits: it's basically predicting who ends up in control
 MSmits: so who is forced to open long chains
 MSmits: this person almost always loses, so it's good to know which moves lead to it not being you
 dbdr: do you ignore the "almost always" part?
 MSmits: no, but the rank1 player does
 dbdr: wow, miklla is so much ahead!
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/570875746">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/570875746</a>
 dbdr: you are also convincingly above Remi
 MSmits: check the replay, here you can see he ignores the almost always
 MSmits: my bot solves for maximum score when it can
 MSmits: mikla doesn't really care about this besides some basic heuristics
 MSmits: you see him make mistakes in the endgame
 dbdr: I think I don't want to open this replay, too distracting&#160;:)
 MSmits: hehe ok 
 dbdr: D&amp;B is a rabbit hole&#160;:)
 MSmits: sure is
 dbdr: is there any reason playing as p1 or p2 would be radically different?
 MSmits: i dont think so, but of course in the end it is solved as either win for p1 or win for p2
 MSmits: draws are impossible
 dbdr: empirically it looks like some of my generations are very good as p1 and others as p2, against the leaderboard
 MSmits: but the branching is so extreme, there's no way to predict
 dbdr: could be coincidence, or not...
 MSmits: well there is a rule about long chains
 MSmits: either you need an even number or odd, to win
 dbdr: oh sorry, I meant to include "... in oware" but seems I forgot :D
 MSmits: lol!
 MSmits: do you use the NN?
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: my experience is that those NN's are extremely deterministic. Check it versus specific players
 MSmits: you might be replaying the same game over and over
 MSmits: that would cause some p1/p2 bias ofc
 dbdr: yes, I think so too. that's why various gens have radically different winrates
 dbdr: also against itself
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: it's also why it's so tempting and too easy to counterbook everyone if i still wanted to
 MSmits: it's just jacek thats hard to beat this way
 MSmits: because he makes it a point to add randomness
 dbdr: he's more random?
 MSmits: yes he adds it into his bot
 dbdr: noise?
 dbdr: I think jacek has separate NNs for p1 and p2
 MSmits: yeah i think on the move decision he adds some small random amount on the child value
 dbdr: Marchete does it too
 dbdr: cgzero
 derjack: hm? i have the same NN
 derjack: i just multiply random [0.9..1.1] * eval in UCT part
 dbdr: oh, that's a big noise
 MSmits: yes this explains why
 derjack: as long as it works...
 MSmits: typically, the first 40 plies or so have hundreds of variations for jacek vs a counterbooked bot
 MSmits: wheras robo has like... 3
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: I wonder if RoboStac's NN has better policies/values, or he just has more sims
 MSmits: but since noone is doing the counterbooking now, it's safe to remove the randomness if it makes the bot better jacek
 MSmits: dbdr he sure has better performance
 MSmits: jacek made no secret of the fact that this is not his strong suit
 MSmits: but not sure if thats the main difference
 Ninjapig28: :money_mouth:
 dbdr: let's play some RPS!
 69razer69: what is rps
 Marchete: dbdr
 Marchete: maybe if you have space
 Marchete: you can try to have 2 NNs
 Marchete: one for P1
 Marchete: another for P2
 Marchete: jace_k does that
 MSmits: he just said he doesnt
 dbdr: I know
 Marchete: lol I haven't read
 Marchete: sorry
 dbdr: 69razer69 Rock Paper Scissors
 Marchete: for repeating
 MSmits: well it was his pony tbh
 dbdr: pony?
 MSmits: der jack
 Marchete: robo has a big NN
 Marchete: and fast
 derjack: somepony
 Marchete: quantized and that
 MSmits: what does it mean that it's quantize
 MSmits: I only know this term from quantum mechanics
 Marchete: working with int8 instead of float32
 Marchete: quantization
 MSmits: so you can do more simd?
 Marchete: 8bit operations at some point
 dbdr: ints have quantas. min difference is 1&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah right
 MSmits: well if that has enough accuracy then that's cool
 Marchete: but it's not super fast, like 40% improvement it seems
 derjack: maybe i should... add second hidden layer
 Marchete: do you have only 1 layer?
 Marchete: I think most non-linear magic happens at that 2nd layer
 MSmits: 1 layer should be able to achieve the same but might need more nodes to do say
 MSmits: to do so
 derjack: i have 192 hidden units in 1 layer
 derjack: 1 hidden layer is enough to approximate any function, though 2 and more is easier
 martinpapa69: having two smaller layers is often better then one bigger
 RoboStac: Marchete - int8 is about double the float32 speed, int16 was the 40%
 Marchete: ahh
 ja_fica: Are you aware of any AI conference to currently publish an article?
 Marchete: sorry robo
 Marchete: I misunderstood
 bluefacebaby: does it has html game?
 bluefacebaby: or game for web dev

 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/sogeti-codefest-2021">https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/sogeti-codefest-2021</a>
 Marchete: "Press DELETE to remove an AI from the test area."
 Marchete: "Press the PLUS button to add another participant AI to the test area."
 Marchete: what's those two buttons?
 dbdr: Players tab
 dbdr: selecting your opponent in the IDE
 Marchete: ahhh
 derjack: is this HS?
 Marchete: damn
 Marchete: I see
 Marchete: I'm dumb
 RoboStac: I'm more interested in the 'you can test as much as you like!'
 Marchete: I thought you can make something new
 dbdr: another semi-private contest it seems
 Marchete: *terms apply
 dbdr: as much as you like, just not as fast as you like
 Marchete: it's like unlimited buffet
 Marchete: it is NOT
 Marchete: :D
 KiwiTae: its from sogeti and intelcorp 
 KiwiTae: oh or just sogeti i guess form the name
 KiwiTae: hehe
 KiwiTae: hope its a physic game :grin:
 martinpapa69: if wonder if im gonna need proxy, its enought to set my home country to participate in this 1
 Marchete: my country is in
 Marchete: but I won't be available, anyways I'm an slow coder
 ja_fica: So portugal cannot participate?
 martinpapa69: I dont think they will make it hard for you to bypass the restrictions
 MSmits: you might have to pick up your prize in a country that's allowed to  participate&#160;:)
 Marchete: I can pick it up
 Marchete: :D
 MSmits: me too
 Marchete: :angry:
 MSmits: it's tempting for me to join also
 martinpapa69: okay might ask one of you to send me my laptop
 MSmits: i usually dont, on these, but the timing is perfect
 Marchete: "this is mine"
 Marchete: there is also job recruitment
 Marchete: maybe you are interested
 MSmits: you dont even need to do well
 MSmits: I got calls when I ended 69th :P
 Marchete: they know you
 MSmits: and when I said i didnt want to work in France, they called me back a few days later to ask me if i wanted to work in the UK instead
 KP56: lmao
 MSmits: so yeah, these contests work :P
 MSmits: for recruitment that is
 MSmits: btw one of my RL friends used to work at sogeti
 MSmits: doing consultancy now
 Marchete: reinforcement learning friends?
 Marchete: weird
 MSmits: yeah :P
 Astrobytes: lol, that's legit what I thought, I was slow to realise 
 MSmits: I have a bunch of reinforcement learning friends i send out to work
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: so much NN talk these days it wouldn't be surprising :D
 MSmits: heh right
 KP56: can i debug without cerr?
 KP56: its very slow and causes timeouts
 MSmits: well just dont over-use it
 MSmits: other than that you get some error sometimes but cerr is by far the most useful debug tool on CG
 MSmits: other than that you can do whatever you like locally, that might sometimes be a preferable way to debug
 KP56: i need to check where my program crashes, but it does so in the function which gets called 10-20k times every round
 MSmits: if your bot is deterministic this can be solved
 MSmits: try to use seeded random
 MSmits: then find the crash by counting iterations
 MSmits: see if it makes it to 1k iterations
 MSmits: if not, then try 500
 MSmits: etc.
 MSmits: binary search wise to find the right iteration
 MSmits: then just debug print on that iteration
 KP56: it makes it to around 8 iterations
 MSmits: allright then print around that time
 KP56: k
 KP56: thanks
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: make sure the bot does the same thing every time
 MSmits: otherwise its really hard to debug

 Astrobytes: hehehe
 BlasphemousCrossbreed: while it might be true, this is still not his concern at all
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: agreed
 struct: I didnt even see the message tbh
 Astrobytes: I didn't either
 BlasphemousCrossbreed: well, for some reason it poped red in chat
 BlasphemousCrossbreed: maybe someone abusing something
 Astrobytes: Yeah it does that if your name is mentioned
 Astrobytes: BlasphemousCrossbreed
 BlasphemousCrossbreed: ah, I c
 BlasphemousCrossbreed: good to know
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 BlasphemousCrossbreed: it is so hard to climb clashes above #100 rank..
 Astrobytes: I don't bother with clashes tbh
 BlaiseEbuth: How's your clash.
 Astrobytes: Infinitely counting down
 martinpapa69: do you know any algorithm, to find the strongest one my local bots? like a BetterTrueSkill™
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-resources/187070">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-resources/187070</a>
 cchorafas: eo
 Marchete: it's called pitplay martinpapa69 :rofl:
 martinpapa69: ye, i want to use the pitplay, but
 martinpapa69: lets say i have 1000 bots
 martinpapa69: and i want to find the strongest one
 martinpapa69: there are efficients ways to compete them vs eachother, and less efficient ways
 Marchete: ahh ah trueskill
 derjack: sounds pity
 Marchete: well, ELO
 BlasphemousCrossbreed: try something like swiss tournaments?
 martinpapa69: ye, i want to know if there is a BetterTrueSkill
 Marchete: submit 1000 times, get the bot with most winrate, ezpz
 martinpapa69: im bored of submit spam :D
 Marchete: automate it :rofl:
 martinpapa69: ye i thought about it tbh
 Marchete: O_o
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not like I answered... :rolling_eyes:
 RoboStac: recurse mentioned using ordo to do that in the spring challenge
 Marchete: ordo seems overly complex
 Marchete: like you need pgn and stuff
 martinpapa69: ye BlaiseEbuth, tx, i heard about CGBenchmark, and used it. but it's rly slow, and the limit of games you can run ide, got reduced recently, i got blocked after like 20 plays in a row
 BlaiseEbuth: I was thinking more about brutaltester in your case.
 Marchete: the problems is that I haven't found a referee
 Astrobytes: The input just needs to be in PGN format, shouldn't be hard to do
 Marchete: Agad_e's one seems to always tie for me
 BlaiseEbuth: PGN? 
 martinpapa69: Marchete gave a tool to compete bots compete vs eachother, thats not the problem here
 Astrobytes: portable game notation BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh.
 martinpapa69: i want an algorithm, that tells wich bots of my population to compete in the arena, so I can tell after like 1000 runs, wich one is the strongest
 Marchete: I messed up AGZ and AZ, and I created a monster :D
 BlaiseEbuth: And so, why not trueskill&#160;?
 Marchete: maybe something like CG does
 Marchete: first matches distributed on the leaderboard
 Marchete: then N games on a range
 martinpapa69: I remember reading about TrueSkill on the forum, that it might not be the best algorithm
 martinpapa69: pb4 complained a lot about it as i remember
 Marchete: problaby isn't
 MSmits: if you're going to use a marginally better algorithm to measure effectiveness, the difference in bot quality is probably not enough to give significantly better ranking on the leaderboard
 RoboStac: it's a bit biased towards recent results (as it's designed for systems where skill isn't static)
 Marchete: but you can fix that
 Marchete: just iterate over all
 Marchete: playing in range N matches
 Marchete: until you are bored
 martinpapa69: yea, that can be a way, but its not the most efficient
 Marchete: it's a trueskill sort
 BlaiseEbuth: If I remember well the problem with trueskill on cg was more because of the quantity of played match.
 martinpapa69: ye...maybe I can add a probability factor to it, so the better bots gets more games, so i dont waste time competing the worst bots. because im interested in finding the best one, not to make the correct order
 Astrobytes: ordo looks good tbh, seems easy to use too
 martinpapa69: gonna check that
 BlaiseEbuth: ordo?
 derjack: ordo!
 Groovygustaf: Is there a simple way to convert a string in python to binary:

 TabulaRasa: Hello everyone, can somebody point me to FAQ or blog post describing what are the rules to be promoted to legend league in bot programming contests? Is it the same as for promotions to lower leagues? (i.e. your bot should beat "the boos")
 RoboStac: yes, promotion is always based around having a higher rank than the boss

 derjack: hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: CLOP
 BlaiseEbuth: Like QWOP with a pony

 BlaiseEbuth: Don't know if the game still exist, since flash is dead... :thinking:

 BlaiseEbuth: That's not me
 LINDI_SHAH: :nerd::rolling_eyes:
 Conbadicus: Im having an issue
 Conbadicus: I feel like the nextCheckpointAngle isn't working accurately, but I must be doing something wrong
 BlaiseEbuth: We've lost the context again...
 Darnoc: Sorry - thought this was the chat for a specific challenge.
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no such thing. Except for clash of code.
 Darnoc: Yes I can see that now
 Astrobytes: Be more specific with your question&#160;;)
 Darnoc: sure, let me try again
 Darnoc: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3781f31-232d-4098-b56c-9e5be25d4c6f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3781f31-232d-4098-b56c-9e5be25d4c6f</a>
 Darnoc: lol.
 Darnoc: However, going through the console step by step doesn't show it ever seeming to fall within those angles.
 Darnoc: which is clearly incorrect.
 Darnoc: i just discovered debug. maybe I can figure this out on my own
 BlaiseEbuth: Doesn't the condition you describe do the exact inverse of what is needed?
 Darnoc: yes sorry I wrote it incorrectly,
 Darnoc: I have it correct in my code
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok
 Darnoc: if the angle is outside of -45 to 45 then go slow.
 Darnoc: between -45 and 45, go fast.
 Darnoc: etc.
 BlaiseEbuth: You can show us your code if you want
 Darnoc: just copy past it here?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup
 Darnoc: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65689900-ceda-44bf-8d5c-6527835df4b5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65689900-ceda-44bf-8d5c-6527835df4b5</a>
 Darnoc: this time I made the angle tighter, at 15
 Darnoc: -15 to 15
 BlaiseEbuth: || is incorrect
 Darnoc: ohhh&#160;?
 nulte: that condition is always true
 BlaiseEbuth: If angle is -30, it's &lt;15 so the condition is correct
 nulte: any number is greater than -15 and less than 15
 BlaiseEbuth: You need to use &amp;&amp;
 Darnoc: classic.
 BlaiseEbuth: To ensure both conditions are correct
 Darnoc: that makes more sense.
 Darnoc: sorry what nulte? 
 Darnoc: or cause it was OR.
 Darnoc: oh
 Darnoc: ok
 Counterbalance: it won't make a difference though.. you best remove that last if:  if (Math.abs(angle) &lt; 15) {} else {}
 Darnoc: I got it figured out
 Darnoc: THanks
 KiwiTae: always go full speed
 Darnoc: oh yeah?
 Darnoc: just blow right passed the checkpoint&#160;?
 KiwiTae: YAA just start turning before u reach it and ull be right on your way toward next CP
 KiwiTae: slowing down is for the weaks
 KiwiTae: :sunglasses:
 Darnoc: that was level 2 I think, you only have access to the very next checkpoint
 Darnoc: if I could read the one after it as well I think I could program a wider turn
 Darnoc: but perhaps thats in a few levels.
 BlaiseEbuth: Nothing prevents you to store cps during the first turn...
 Darnoc: lol I was considering that..
 KiwiTae: instead of slowing down target the checkpoint minus your current time averaged delta position
 Darnoc: word
 Darnoc: im pickin up what youre putting down
 KiwiTae: Madknight would have told you 3v and walked away
 Darnoc: dunno who that is or what 3v is
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix your -3vel and go legend
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 BlaiseEbuth: Use my starter KiwiTae
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 KiwiTae: did he disappear? long time no see
 Darnoc:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm afraid he's a little angry...
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact I'm not even sure Tibo unbaned him... :thinking:
 KiwiTae: oooh he got banned
 KiwiTae: i miss the gossips
 BlaiseEbuth: I banned him yeah...
 KiwiTae: pewpew
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 MSmits: madknight is banned?
 BlaiseEbuth: Is or was...
 MSmits: i see
 MSmits: well I can imagine a situation where that was necessary
 BlaiseEbuth: Only one? -_-
 MSmits: well more than 1 is too much work
 MSmits: dont need more 
 DarkLord__28: Op dcuber in chat'
 Darnoc: wow battling through the ranks takes while
 swattz: Is the goal on this site to write the shortest, most terse code that nobody would ever want to have to maintain?  That's the kind of code that seems to get the most upvotes.
 Marchete: yes, it is
 swattz: Hopefully I never hire anyone from here (I do hire some programmers)
 Marchete: I was just kidding
 Marchete: upvotes are usually given to how different that solution is
 dbdr: swattz: give us an example
 Darnoc: hi swattz I know some if for loops please give me a job.
 Marchete: btw programmers that usually use that platform are much better than usual programmers
 Marchete: because they are always trying to improve
 BlaiseEbuth: No. They're bad, their code is ugly
 Marchete: my code is
 nulte: my avx code is not ugly&#160;:(
 dbdr: fix it
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. And you're bad Marchete
 Marchete: lol, every AVX code is ugly
 Marchete: you can't beautify it
 BlaiseEbuth: swattz will never hire you
 Marchete: hopefully
 nulte: if you make the interview code a connect 4 bot I might pass
 Marchete: if you make the interview code a working NN bot I might pass too
 Marchete: maybe he expects the classical for loop in descent
 BlaiseEbuth: He said he never hire people from here. He probably check if you have a CG account before interview
 Marchete: damn! well, anyways....
 KiwiTae: since my colleagues joined CG our codebase is all golfed so beautiful
 dbdr: and commit base64 encodes versions of your company code
 Marchete: your code isn't good enough? add more randomness and spam resubmit until it hits
 Marchete: maybe he won't hire me now
 inoryy: split everything into 100kb chunks
 Marchete: ah! and I make big arrays, of 750MB
 inoryy: hired
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 nulte: I solved the descent with AVX
 BlaiseEbuth: I solved Onboarding with a NN.
 KiwiTae: I solved it with random output submit until it worked
 Marchete: hired!

 Astrobytes: That might force me to do my rewrite I've been putting off
 darkhorse64: Time to create another one 
 nulte: another game?
 darkhorse64: yep
 saadatjoo15: amokos
 saadatjoo15:&#160;:|
 nulte: Which one are you thinking on porting?
 Astrobytes: what do you have in mind?
 darkhorse64: Ataxx
 Astrobytes: Cool, that sdhould be fun
 Astrobytes: *should
 darkhorse64: aka Infection. BlaiseEbuth should love it
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?
 darkhorse64: It's a plague tale
 nulte: I have arimaa and havannah on my todo list
 Astrobytes: Cool
 darkhorse64: Abalone is coming too
 Astrobytes: Waiting on 1 approval still?
 darkhorse64: I think so, it deserves more upvotes
 jacek: MSmits, another hex game awaits your approval
 nulte: its 63 cells right?
 jacek: oh, clobber potw.
 jacek: eeyup
 darkhorse64: Free CP
 nulte: One day ill make a boss for yavalath
 nulte: or even a bot
 Astrobytes: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: The good ol' time of the plague... *sigh*
 jacek: next potw amazons? more CP :imp:
 nulte: free rank for you&#160;:(

 nulte: o.o
 jacek: hm?
 nulte: on breakthrough vs my current bot
 jacek: 13th, woad
 jacek: woah
 Astrobytes: woad eh
 MSmits: be careful jacek, or he might start talking plant stuff
 Astrobytes: I was thinking more about the dye you get from the plant but eh
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: that's allright, ramble away about dye then
 Astrobytes: I wasn't planning to :D
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Cheeky git :P
 MSmits: that's me
 MSmits: jacek is my git copilot
 Astrobytes: Hah! Well played.
 MSmits: still working on beating mikla
 nulte: i added pruning to moves
 nulte: Not sure how well it will do on leaderboard
 MSmits: what are you pruning?
 jacek: meh, adding 2nd is worse. iteration wise its better but too slow :s
 jacek: hes pruning worse moves, obviously
 Astrobytes: A game tree MSmits
 nulte: I pruning nonsense moves
 nulte: like giving away a piece for nothing
 MSmits: you mean your bot is better with the same number of iterations compared to 1 hidden layer?
 MSmits: but the iterations take so much time, it's not feasiblew
 jacek: its not surprisin
 MSmits: not really no
 jacek: but additional layer is more costly
 Astrobytes: surprisin feasiblew
 MSmits: did you also reduce nodes per layer?
 MSmits: there might be some tradeoff possible there
 jacek: a little bit
 MSmits: i guess it's difficult to do good tests when training takes so long
 MSmits: 2 hidden layers takes a lot longer to train i bet
 Astrobytes: That looks decent already nulte
 nulte: i cant beat tric
 nulte:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: It ain't easy
 nulte: I think i kinda messed it up
 nulte: I need to fix it
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to find the tric to beat trick
 Astrobytes: To get back on track with the trac
 jacek: good ol' time when i was struggling against him...
 BlaiseEbuth: Tric these days...
 LINDI_SHAH: are you guys playing
 LINDI_SHAH: :thinking::confused:
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?
 LINDI_SHAH: what game nd where
 nulte: Breakthrough
 LINDI_SHAH: ima noob here
 nulte: codingame
 LINDI_SHAH: .com
 LINDI_SHAH:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Breakthrough.com?
 LINDI_SHAH: where to find this Breakthrough
 nulte: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough</a>
 Astrobytes:&#160;:(
 LINDI_SHAH: thx bro! nulte
 jacek: now try to find some papers about breakthrough (the game)
 jacek: all you will get is about beating cancer or something :unamused:
 MSmits: yeah I don't know why google doesn't put the more important stuff up top
 Astrobytes: improve your internet search techniques jacek
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 BlaiseEbuth: Or why scientist care about cancer where there's breaktrough...
 jacek: nulte noice <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/570998585">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/570998585</a>
 Astrobytes: :clap: and not a close one either
 nulte: I must fix eval
 nulte:&#160;:(
 MSmits: I heard some people have an eval with 200 + params
 nulte:&#160;?????
 Astrobytes: 200+&#160;!!!
 MSmits: yeah, they call them NN's
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: too easy
 MSmits: my D&amp;B bitboarding is giving me headaches
 MSmits: maybe a graph would have been easier
 MSmits: I have that for my score solver, but not for the nim solver
 jacek: well if you have piece-square tables, that already 64, or 32 with symmetry
 Marchete: graph ftw
 MSmits: some steps will be a lot slower with graph though
 Marchete: what steps
 MSmits: I detect short chains over the entire board at the same time
 Astrobytes: graph seems logical for dnb to me, you can still bitboard parts
 MSmits: with graph i would have to traverse it
 Marchete: I cut a chain and create the shortest
 Marchete: not really
 jacek: i use graph only in 1 game
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: bitboards +chains
 nulte: if I it has graphs I dont play it
 MSmits: also hashing
 MSmits: its easy with bitboard
 Marchete: my hashing is done with graph properties
 Marchete: I can rotate any chain
 Marchete: it's the same hash
 Marchete: rotate or bend to the opposite
 MSmits: sure, that could help
 Marchete: then, add more chains
 MSmits: i guess hashing is my main obstacle
 Marchete: and I still get the same hash
 MSmits: I just don't know how to do that properly
 Astrobytes: Learn&#160;;)
 Marchete: see the properties of each chain
 jacek: smoke
 MSmits: btw, a nim solver for D&amp;B has only simple objects
 Marchete: connections to ground
 Marchete: length
 Marchete: etc
 MSmits: no chains and such
 MSmits: i mean, max 1 or 2 long if its a chain
 MSmits: if its longer, you can ignore it
 MSmits: including all loops 
 MSmits: doesnt even matter if it's grounded or not
 MSmits: 3 or more = ignore
 MSmits: because you cant play those without losing the game immediately
 MSmits: (the nim game)
 Astrobytes: makes sense
 MSmits: this is why graphs were somewhat less interesting to me
 jacek: :rage:
 Astrobytes: I suppose there are multiple approaches, maybe a combo is better?
 MSmits: well my score solver is mostly graph
 Marchete: I really can say
 Marchete: because I just ended my graph simulator
 Marchete: and got bored
 MSmits: you'll come back to it eventually
 Marchete: I don't know if it's better MCTS , minimax
 MSmits: for D&amp;B?
 MSmits: minimax most likely
 Astrobytes: minimax seems totally appropriate
 MSmits: because TT works better
 Marchete: or well, NN :kissing_smiling_eyes:
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: there's no point using NN for over half the game as you can solve it in microseconds
 MSmits: my nim solver can solve after ply 55 in like 7 microseconds
 Marchete: yeah, you can sim oware in microseconds too
 MSmits: i mean solve, get the gametheoretical value
 MSmits: for every possible move
 nulte: o.o
 MSmits: the nim value that is (so 0 or 1 )
 nulte: is it possible to avx D&amp;B?
 MSmits: maybe, not sure
 oxydowe: hello world chat
 Marchete: I don't have avx
 jacek: youre poor
 MSmits: gonna go see a movie
 MSmits: ttyl
 nulte: cya
 Marchete: :head_bandage:
 nulte: Does dbdr have NN on bt?
 jacek: no that i know of
 Astrobytes: I don't believe so
 nulte: I check tric replay it was solved on frame 60
 nulte: his iterations seem quite low
 jacek: tric doesnt write any iterations?
 nulte: i mean dbd r
 nulte: his iterations seem quite low
 nulte: for a top 5 bot
 nulte: like 5 iterations 2nd turn?
 nulte: 5k*
 Marchete: 5k? a NN :D
 Marchete: mine goes from 5k to 10k
 jacek: in oware*
 Marchete: 80% of my time is NN
 Marchete: nah
 Marchete: 160k sims
 Marchete: it seems it isn't
 jacek: in bt i have about 2k iterations
 jacek: or more like 40k nodes
 Marchete: ah
 AllYourTrees: D&amp;B or amazons?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: or puzzle of the week
 nulte: :notebook: :soccer:
 Emeric97113: hi
 AllYourTrees: how do you find the puzzle of the week?
 jacek: on quest map
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: AllYourTrees you should get a notification about it
 jacek: on tuesday
 Astrobytes: Quest map updates before the notification
 jacek: D:
 AllYourTrees: i don't think i've unlocked puzzle of the week in quest map lol
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/clobber">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/clobber</a>
 AllYourTrees: fun!
 69razer69: should i write statment even if it is a reverse mode that i am targeting in contributions
 nulte: if its only reverse than its not needed
 AntiSquid: comments are posted "4 years" before the puzzle was made, is time travel real? what's up with CG&#160;? :D
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5026597b1573e76c4e9897e8627c388fe71?comment=9131">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5026597b1573e76c4e9897e8627c388fe71?comment=9131</a>
 nulte: So the statement now gives the solution?
 ANONYMOUS42: i guess someone published their old private clash contribution
 Westicles: No, Zima just scrubbed the text
 ANONYMOUS42: oh yeah i see it's just zima's comments that are new
 69razer69: "statment is mandatory" in reverse mode contribution
 69razer69:&#160;??
 nulte: just put some random thing in it
 Westicles: I can't figure out why this one got deactivated, I thought it was a nice one
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6237c51ddaa53487af10cb313ac4631e0371">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6237c51ddaa53487af10cb313ac4631e0371</a>
 ANONYMOUS42: is there an automated system for deactivations?
 ANONYMOUS42: or does it require moderator approval too
 ANONYMOUS42: or admin idk
 Westicles: yes, the mod bot turns off ones with low scores
 ANONYMOUS42: wait so who gets to see the reports from the players
 Astrobytes: 20 low votes or something?
 ANONYMOUS42: or does it just go to the void lol
 Astrobytes: It's automated, based on the rating
 nulte: if its not a regex coc you are at risk
 ANONYMOUS42: lmao i sometimes write reports explaining what's wrong with the clash
 ANONYMOUS42: i guess that was a lie
 Astrobytes: No, they go through
 Astrobytes: Not to us, but to CG staff
 Astrobytes: If there's an issue it's usually a good idea to mention in chat or whatever, someone with the required level can edit the contribution if needed.
 ANONYMOUS42: i guess i can edit them myself even. but i avoid doing that. just seems kinda weird that they allow you to change others' contributions just because you played 50 clashes
 Astrobytes: That's why it's generally a good idea to get a consensus on the matter from others first
 Marchete: I disagree
 nulte: if people could edit temperatures
 nulte: It would be a mess
 Astrobytes: You disagree with what Marchete?
 Marchete: with your consensus
 Astrobytes: Why?
 Marchete: jk
 Marchete: :O
 Marchete: :P
 nulte: ban him
 nulte:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: FFS :D
 ANONYMOUS42: banhammer

 ANONYMOUS42: how many fonts can you paste here lol
 nulte: Any "How to write an eval for dummies"?
 Counterbalance: return "ur dumb";
 AllYourTrees: write your own nn &amp; AZ framework, train a NN, do research to understand how to get AI to explain their decisions, publish and become very famous, then use your result to write a rule based eval
 AllYourTrees: ez
 Astrobytes: No. It's like voodoo. You get better at it over time.
 ANONYMOUS42: you get better at voodoo over time?
 Astrobytes: Of course.
 ANONYMOUS42: Understandable, have a nice day
 Astrobytes: Don't take that literally :D
 ANONYMOUS42: I don't know why they don't let the ascii emotes alone
 ANONYMOUS42: they look better than these emojis
 Astrobytes: It's a trivial issue.
 ANONYMOUS42: Not to me. Join us at savetheemotes.com to learn more about the emote genocide.

 nulte: Such a weird position
 ANONYMOUS42: whoa that pawn capture animation caught me off guard lmao
 nulte: White opening seems like an opening book
 nulte: Never saw my ai do that before
 jacek: hm?
 nulte: The opening is a bit weird
 ANONYMOUS42: it did look kinda symmetric
 ANONYMOUS42: symetric?
 nulte: frame 11 white pieces are all symmetric
 jacek: have you seen the proposed opening from the author of game?

 jacek: my self learned bot somewhat prefers the bottom one
 jacek: at least what it does in littlegolem
 ANONYMOUS42: are there other chess modes bot games?
 ANONYMOUS42: like horde and antichess
 nulte: no
 jacek: just chess960
 nulte: antichess is solved though
 ANONYMOUS42: i didn't know that

 ANONYMOUS42: I don't know much about chess so just ignore me lol
 Astrobytes: how is your littlegolem bot jacek? Still undefeated?
 AllYourTrees: what's littlegolem?
 Astrobytes: Essentially a play by mail site for board games.
 Astrobytes: - the mail part
 Astrobytes: Slowww games
 AllYourTrees: interesting

 jacek: from the mcts solver paper guys?
 jacek: is the statement gonna be written the same way? :scream:
 nulte: I never played it so im not sure
 Astrobytes: jacek: 2 losses, fix it! Damn strong bot man
 jacek: i use about 10 seconds per move

 69razer69: i just published my first contribution
 jacek: :tada:
 69razer69: :flushed:
 Astrobytes: Tough loss on that one jacek. So you submitted the new one yet on there?
 jacek: yes
 nulte: you submit it or run it localy?
 jacek: there is no official api. html parser, run locally and make move
 jacek: there is only correspondence games
 69razer69: you guys talking about breakthrough
 69razer69:&#160;?
 jacek: eeyup
 69razer69: is there a website where i can play it against friend
 jacek: dunno

 Wontonimo: yo
 nulte: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hey nulte
 Wontonimo: i'm cleaning up my mcts from uttt to reuse for c4
 Wontonimo: whatcha up to?
 nulte: breakthrough
 Wontonimo: nice
 nulte: Trying to figure an evaluation
 Wontonimo: i've heard that minimax for small sections of the board is something that's worked
 Wontonimo: but i have no idea what that means
 nulte: hmm, mixing mcts with minimax?
 Wontonimo: or beam
 Wontonimo: i think where minimax comes in, and i could totally be wrong here, is discovering an unstoppable final push with one pawn
 Wontonimo: which would just take really long with mcts, even with solver mcts
 Wontonimo: hmm... my "improved" mcts on uttt seems to be doing worse than my previous version
 nulte: whats the improvement?
 Wontonimo: i replaced 'new' with a pre-allocated pool for the Nodes
 nulte: that should be a big performance boost
 Wontonimo: meh
 Wontonimo: i was 30th before and i'm still 30th
 Wontonimo: it's probably not where i'm losing time.  i should really put this through a profiler 
 nulte: not a bad idea
 nulte: I do a few tricks to check early wins there
 Wontonimo: speaking of which ... why not now
 nulte: I think im ~rank 15 there
 nulte: on struct
 nulte: do you have mcts solver?
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's a really nice little branch of code
 Wontonimo: you?
 nulte: yes I also have solver there
 nulte: I feel like its always worth
 Wontonimo: ah, the yo-yo of final "rank stabilazation"
 Wontonimo: for all that, i moved up 1 rank
 Wontonimo: 29th now lol
 nulte: I can check my rollouts
 nulte: 1 sec
 Wontonimo: i'm at 102k on second move 
 struct: you rollout every child?
 struct: I think I get around the same
 struct: I get like 1.2Mil+- in 1 sec
 Wontonimo: no, i allocate them but don't roll them out
 struct: and you still can do 102k rollouts? o.o
 Wontonimo: ah, i do 3 rollouts per node and have a lower UCB_C 
 Wontonimo: the higher rollout means more certainty which means lower UCB_C needed.
 Wontonimo: but since i've changed the performance of the rest of it, i should go back and retest that trade off 
 struct: do you reuse the tree?
 struct: im not sure how much gain it is
 Wontonimo: yes sire
 Wontonimo: *sir
 struct: do you check for early wins at all?
 Wontonimo: mcts+solver + tree reuse + prealloc
 Wontonimo: we are talking UTTT right?
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: how do you do early wins in UTTT?
 struct: if for example you have 4 miniboards completed and opponent 3 and no more miniboards can be won
 struct: its a win
 struct: miniboard can still be played but cant be won by either player
 Wontonimo: oh, interesting
 Wontonimo: makes sense for sure, but there is no specific check or data structure i have for that
 struct: yeah i added a uint16_t	completed = 0; // if the miniboard is complete
 struct: bit 0 is board 0, bit 1 1 and so on
 struct: uint16_t	not_winnable = 0; // if the miniboard can still be won by either player
 struct: Same for not_winnable var
 Wontonimo: it make sense for sure, thanks
 struct: np
 struct: also do you use lookup table for wins?
 Wontonimo: no lookup tables, no "book"
 Wontonimo: no transposition tables
 struct: lookup &gt; avx &gt; for loop
 struct: in terms of speed
 Wontonimo: oh, i see, yes i have a 512 lookup for win of miniboard
 struct: yes
 struct: ah good
 Wontonimo: 58k on 2nd move if i do 1 rollout per node like everyone else.
 struct: I do rollout for every child
 Wontonimo: hmm.  i could try that pretty easily i think ...
 struct: for some people is better for others it isnt
 Wontonimo: that was pretty easy
 Wontonimo: brutal test running
 Wontonimo: interesting ...
 struct: is it doing better?
 Wontonimo: i'll have to explore the UCB_C as it's going to change it a lot
 Wontonimo: it's getting 116k on 2nd move
 struct: yes it does more rollouts
 struct: but less nodes
 struct: so it also solves later
 Wontonimo: oh, right
 Wontonimo: i'm doing a local test for ucb_c.  it is kinda doing a similar thing to my 3/node 
 Wontonimo: but more heavily on high branch factor areas
 Wontonimo: SUBMIT&#160;!
 struct: gl
 struct: brutaltesting with 2 threads takes a while&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: do you use the grandfather heuristic?
 struct: whats that?
 Wontonimo: where you seed the score with the score of the grandfather parent
 Wontonimo: (the players previous move)
 struct: no
 Wontonimo: well, it isn't horrible.  already at 40th after 1/5th of its battles
 Wontonimo: it's promising at least.  Brutal test is telling me it is marginal (vs my old bot)
 Wontonimo: i still have a bunch of small odds and ends that are fairly easy optimizations
 Wontonimo: but nothing that will really push it further.  i really just wanted to give a good go at converting it from "new" to a pre-allocated Node pool
 struct: its hard to make progress on it
 struct: Nagrarok was 1st at one point with this bot
 struct: his* current submit
 struct: not 15+ players are above him
 struct: On connect 4 I did no progress
 struct: my current bot is the one I submited on day 1 with just a bug fix
 struct: I cant progress there at all
 struct: I have 1 idea now though due to breakthrough
 struct: But I wont reveal it for now, I dont think I ever saw it mentioned in chat
 Wontonimo: cool!  it's really nice finding new things
 Wontonimo: latest change either isn't helping enough or else I've got to find the new hyper parameters that work with it
 Wontonimo: oh no ... i think my i killed my solver is what happened
 struct: you have parameters besides exploration factor?
 Wontonimo: yes, i have a soft weight for the board move heuristic
 Wontonimo: actually, it didn't do bad for not having a working solver
 struct: yeah
 struct: first time I added solver I climbed quite a bit
 Wontonimo: my previous submit had a working solver.  back in Jan i added it and went from 90th to around 60th, so yeah, a good leap
 struct: Similar to what I experienced
 struct: I think i went from 100th to 50th
 Wontonimo: well that was a bad submit
 struct: might have a bug now
 Wontonimo: definitely have a bug
 Wontonimo: okay, i'm pretty sure the solver *was* working and i killed it by thinking it wasn't
 Wontonimo: well, that's about it for me for tonight.  felt accomplished finally implementing the Node Pool
 Wontonimo: and making it perform at least as well as "new"
 struct: its a bit strange though
 Wontonimo: maybe tomorrow i'll open a profiler and see what craziness i've done to make the pool lame
 Wontonimo: it should be a lot better.  i was calling new for every node
 struct: yeah
 Wontonimo: i also remove "parent" form the Node class, so my nodes are even smaller now
 struct: Whats your ndoe size?
 Wontonimo: 136&#160;!  what?
 struct: 1 node is 136 bytes?

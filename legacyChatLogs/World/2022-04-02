 Wontonimo: :wave:
 AzrielCodes: python looks so easy comparitively
 Wontonimo: yeah, that something really nice about it
 AzrielCodes: lol
 AzrielCodes: i just gotta say, since i've been thinking about this for a bit, I respect your knowledge and the hard work that went into your acquisition of it.
 Wontonimo: oh thanks&#160;!
 Wontonimo: i stole if from someone smarter
 Wontonimo: *it
 TimberStalker: I had to leave my computer so if anyone answered my previous question sorry. In labyrinth, i cant find a path short enough from C to the start in test case 05. What is the correct path?
 AzrielCodes: i'm sorta stealing it from you
 Wontonimo: let me look TimberStalker
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6077d56c-2afe-47ed-a54f-8eccb58402ce">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6077d56c-2afe-47ed-a54f-8eccb58402ce</a>
 Wontonimo: that's what my program found going there
 Wontonimo: and you can see the shortest path just eyeballing it
 TimberStalker: I see it now.
 Wontonimo: so the question is, if you put this maze into your search, what path does it find?
 TimberStalker: Why is my program going the other way
 Wontonimo: do you print out a map of what your program knows every turn&#160;?
 Wontonimo: something like this
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/08a93a29-75ef-4f12-8af1-8bbe939cbd90">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/08a93a29-75ef-4f12-8af1-8bbe939cbd90</a>
 TimberStalker: ya i do
 TimberStalker: for some reason A* takes me this way
 TimberStalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/654dd73f-f218-44ac-ac4b-aeeed990a9cb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/654dd73f-f218-44ac-ac4b-aeeed990a9cb</a>
 Wontonimo: that's A- , not A*
 TimberStalker: wait
 TimberStalker: it switches direction
 TimberStalker: why
 TimberStalker: doesent a star guarantee the same path at any point on the path?
 Wontonimo: why doesn't that pass?  looks like it should pass to me
 TimberStalker: Because it then goes like this
 TimberStalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d4cef4d-5f01-48da-894c-e8a63a0ccb8c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d4cef4d-5f01-48da-894c-e8a63a0ccb8c</a>
 Wontonimo: did it actually explore and know of both paths?
 eulerscheZahl: codejam is live
 TimberStalker: Yes, it knows both paths. It was able to pathfinde both ways. For some reason though, it switches to the longer one
 Wontonimo:&#160;? don't know
 Wontonimo: which codejam eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000876ff1">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000876ff1</a>
 TimberStalker: Its probably a mistake in my minheap implementation
 TimberStalker: or something
 Wontonimo: floodfill will solve it also.  you don't actually need A* as it is overkill for this problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfdqg4IL5r4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfdqg4IL5r4</a>
 Wontonimo: start from your target and flood, starting with painting the number 0, the 1 in the next squares, then 2 in the next, etc
 Wontonimo: anyway .... it's late here.  ng
 TimberStalker: a actually floodfill anyway. To find the nearest unknown tile and to see if i can reach C
 TimberStalker: then i A* to the point i found
 TimberStalker: which means i probably dont even need A* does it
 linjoehan: I dont get D or E but I still qualify
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey linjoehan, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 5 tacos
 linjoehan: * I dont get it yet
 linjoehan: I know the solve of E will be a mind f*** if I don't get it before it's all over
 linjoehan: but also I loled at eulerscheZahl when he said you need half hour to get the qualify problems done and I did it in under half hour
 linjoehan: the real challenge is to get all 100 points
 eulerscheZahl: i have D solved
 eulerscheZahl: for E i get 100% correct locally but wrong answer on submit (so less than 90%)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm even well within the error margins, not even close to the 33% tolerance. more like 1-2%
 eulerscheZahl: i'm clueless
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: linjoehan
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has awarded linjoehan 6 tacos. linjoehan now has 11 taco. eulerscheZahl now has 30 taco
 PatrickMcGinnisII: antiwonto hates me
 ASM_MOV_INT: they REALLY need a dark theme for this website.... all the cool kids are doing it, microsoft with windows and edge...!
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey ASM_MOV_INT, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 15 tacos
 ASM_MOV_INT: i open a powershell instance, and set the background color to 60% transparency, then fit it over the window
 eulerscheZahl: can't you just install an addon like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en</a>&#160;?
 Westicles: or just use settings:theme:dark side?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ that
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's a thing?i never looked into it, i'm fine with light themes
 eulerscheZahl: i use whatever the default is
 Westicles: it only applies to IDE pages though
 Slee: Hello, any one have some good learning ressource for modern C++? book / ebook name
 jacek: happy Caturday
 dbf: Caturday! Anyone in participating in code jam?
 eulerscheZahl: yes dbf. 71 points so far, clueless why the last one doesn't accept my submission (works offline)
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey eulerscheZahl, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 31 tacos
 eulerscheZahl: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has eaten 10 :taco: and your Strength is now 6.  You have 21 left
 eulerscheZahl: even tourist with 5 failed attempts on the interactive problem
 dbf: cool, I've just completed punchcards&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: ASCII art
 eulerscheZahl: "just completed" as in "30 minutes ago"
 dbf: do you know, what does it mean if there is output for a test but 'SERVER ERROR' is displayed on the top? And test is marked as Completed in submissions?
 dbf: just submitted it and it is fine, one more to go&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the 3rd problem is a simple one as well
 dbf: based on your/mine performance on task 2 should solve it in ~30 mins&#160;:)
 codycanteatthistoo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0ee89e5b-b355-476c-b3a4-f855f936581c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0ee89e5b-b355-476c-b3a4-f855f936581c</a>
 dbf: lol, done in 31 min&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, you are now qualified. will you still try the other tasks?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a long delay between 3rd and 4th. but not that hard, just got distracted by cat
 dbf: maybe later today, need to finish my breakfast&#160;:)
 dbf: thanks for the comment abount task #4, I was scared to see that you spend 1 hour on it
 eulerscheZahl: it's definitely harder than the first 3. but still doable with a bit of thinking. and you don't need to know fancy graph algorithms to solve it
 DomiKo: Talking about Code Jam?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey DomiKo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 4 tacos
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 DomiKo: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] you need at least 10 tacos to make a proper meal
 DomiKo: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: DomiKo
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry eulerscheZahl but you can only award tacos once per day
 DomiKo: Any nice tasks?
 eulerscheZahl: first 3 are boring. 4th is a bit of thinking
 eulerscheZahl: on 5 (interactive) i fail and no idea why (maybe they hardcoded some inputs while the local runner generates randomly)
 DomiKo: yeah they do that
 DomiKo: local generator dont use 'brain'
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 AlexandreAllard: Hello!
 Nerchio: what code jam did you talk about?
 DomiKo: Google Code Jam
 eulerscheZahl: you can google it
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey eulerscheZahl, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 22 tacos
 eulerscheZahl: lmgtfy Nerchio code jam
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Nerchio let me google that for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=code+jam">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=code+jam</a>
 Nerchio: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: 1000 tshirts up for grabs
 martinpapa69: how much effort do you think it takes to get in the t-shirt zone&#160;?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey martinpapa69, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 9 tacos
 martinpapa69: it would be nice to show my collegues how superior programmer am I with a google tshirt
 DomiKo: I guess it depends on how much you already know
 eulerscheZahl: time-wise: qulification: 30min
 eulerscheZahl: then round 1+2 about 3h each
 DomiKo: But T-Shirt zone isn't "free" 
 orendon: t-shirt is for top 100?
 eulerscheZahl: but it's not that easy to reach top1000. i have 2 tshirts out of 5 or 6 attempts
 eulerscheZahl: top 1000
 orendon: got it
 martinpapa69: shiet
 martinpapa69: i dont have too much free time rn
 eulerscheZahl: you only need 30min now
 martinpapa69: oh sure that cool
 eulerscheZahl: there are 3 first rounds (for time zones)
 eulerscheZahl: and a common round 2 with the best from the previous first rounds
 eulerscheZahl: that's the tshirt round
 eulerscheZahl: top of round 2 or round 3, then finals
 orendon: did you sole all in 30min? thats super fast to me
 eulerscheZahl: you only need 30 points
 eulerscheZahl: that's 2-3 puzzles, depending on which you take
 orendon: I just did 44 points, but I spend &gt;30
 eulerscheZahl: linjoehan needed less than 30min for the qualifiers. i considered it a realistic average for users here who do well in bot programming but haven't trained for that type of task
 orendon: yeah, I think is a good rationale
 martinpapa69: holy, i get bored by just reading the problem
 orendon: yeah 1st one is boring
 eulerscheZahl: qualifiers always have some boring tasks
 eulerscheZahl: the 4th starts to get interesting
 eulerscheZahl: will get harder in later rounds
 eulerscheZahl: skip the statement, task 1 is just ASCII art
 orendon: I havent join CG in a while, are bot contests once a year now?
 eulerscheZahl: we don't really know
 eulerscheZahl: 2 contests per year but we don't know the format of each
 eulerscheZahl: next one will be bot though
 orendon: hope is not the cooperate kind
 orendon: but the old classic ones
 eulerscheZahl: will be business back to usual
 eulerscheZahl: i even took off a week
 eulerscheZahl: no excuses for me if i fail
 orendon: I just started a new job, so can't do that, but will try to join anyway
 orendon: do you often take some time off to reach legend?
 eulerscheZahl: Medellin, isn't that where Pablo Escobar is from?
 eulerscheZahl: reaching legend isn't the problem for me. i want to do better than that
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, taking off for a CG contest isn't that unusual for me
 DomiKo: week off - so it means FULL mode? 
 orendon: yep, but Pablo's thing where like 30 years ago, totally different now
 DomiKo: I will take a little break at Uni too :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: stupid question from my side, must be like Americans asking if Hitler is still alive
 eulerscheZahl: my grades definitely tanked a bit, thanks to CG
 eulerscheZahl: back then, contests were more regular
 Mr_FaZ3a: hi
 orendon: no worries, it's all good now if you happen to come someday
 orendon: Hi Mr_FaZ3a
 orendon: I just started working, kind of jelous to have that time school time back euler/domiko
 eulerscheZahl: i finished university 4 years ago
 eulerscheZahl: fun times
 eulerscheZahl: but i can take off when I want to
 orendon: very cool
 orendon: in your exp, what's needed to reach legend nowadays?
 eulerscheZahl: rebuild the game engine and simulate a few turns ahead
 DomiKo: I am slowly finishing my studies, and taking a little bit more than for CG comes with big cost.
 eulerscheZahl: as a rule of thumb, might be different for heuristics contests
 eulerscheZahl: any plans for the time after graduation?
 eulerscheZahl: PhD vs other employment
 DomiKo: Right now I'm searching for the best place in the world for me 
 DomiKo: And I don't really see myself at PhD. Definitely not right now
 eulerscheZahl: i can relate, was done after my master thesis
 eulerscheZahl: as much as i like to study, writing isn't my thing at all
 DomiKo: I believe I like more coding.
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I do now. results in less motivation for coding own projects like CG bots&#160;:(
 DomiKo:&#160;:( 
 eulerscheZahl: i can motivate myself for contests but not much more
 DomiKo: Right now I can do most of my study projects at CG, so it's a nice merge.
 eulerscheZahl: that's really cool
 DomiKo: yeah it is
 DomiKo: But one thing's for sure: you'll see me here for a while longer. 
 eulerscheZahl: it's a lovely place
 DomiKo: It really is
 DomiKo: And the coolest thing is that community is growing. Not only in terms of people, but in knowledge too. 
 eulerscheZahl: too bad that the chat will be removed&#160;:(
 DomiKo: Yeah, that's a bit sad
 martinpapa69: why tho&#160;?
 DomiKo: Money is always a answer
 martinpapa69:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: maintenance effort, lack of moderation abilities
 DomiKo: However, maybe discord will be better.
 eulerscheZahl: for now it's mostly spam. i left the server
 DomiKo: It's true.
 DomiKo: Never really used it, because most conversations were here. 
 DomiKo: But Discord has some potential. 
 DomiKo: I would like to see really nicknames from CG. Maybe even ranks from CG. 
 eulerscheZahl: should be possible. topcoder discord renames everyone to match the nicknames
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces assigns roles based on CF ranking
 DomiKo: Yeah I know.
 eulerscheZahl: afk, cat is yelling for attention :D
 DomiKo: Cat is cat. You have to give him what he wants :smile:
 Slee: Hello guys, do we agree the C++ certification is like an easy task? 
 abt8601: It looks like a number of people on Discord say so
 Slee: i consider myself as a bad C++ programmer, and managed to obtains 99%+, that's seem a bit wrong
 abt8601: Well, the problems don't seem to be particularly difficult, so I guess it's pretty easy to ace the test :thinking_face:
 eulerscheZahl: 90% are better than 99% of all users. i highly doubt that the score has anything to do with actual results of others
 orendon: which cert?
 orendon: should I join the discord?
 Slee: c++ one, the problems are easy af and there is no need to use some langage specific thing
 Slee: i don't really get the goal of theses certifications
 eulerscheZahl: it's on your CG profile page
 martinpapa69: google t-shirt here i come :smirk:
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey martinpapa69, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 10 tacos
 martinpapa69: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] martinpapa69 has eaten 10 :taco: and your Swag is now 1.  You have 0 left
 facutito: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Nerchio: this bot is annoying lol
 eulerscheZahl: it's gotten harder to receive t-shirts here in Germany&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: they just get sent back by customs without even informing me
 martinpapa69: maybe its easier to just print one
 Westicles: gute fahrt t-shirt
 eulerscheZahl: i found another user willing to play proxy. I hope it's easier once it's inside the EU
 eulerscheZahl: backup plan would be to reach onsite-finals and pick it up in person
 Ajaiy: I just realized that someone with four CodinGame accounts which have all played 50 Clash of Codes can approve any CoC contribution
 eulerscheZahl: 4 to approve own contributions, 3 for someone else's
 eulerscheZahl: you can also edit approved ones with 300 clashes played
 Wontonimo: i'd really like to see some auto-mod tools that look for recurring groups of people self-approving and prevent it.  wouldn't be hard to write at all
 Ajaiy: but what if people have totally random names?
 Ajaiy: for each of their accounts?
 Wontonimo: 1st iteration is easy&#160;: have you approved or been approved by [user] recently, then not allowed
 Wontonimo: 1st iteration also&#160;: same ip?  not allowed
 Ajaiy: ohhhh
 Ajaiy: that's smart
 Wontonimo: there are obvious work arounds, but it just becomes more work
 Wontonimo: and just like locks, they are not unpickable, but the extra work involved deters most
 Ajaiy: It does fail when you have 3 or more friends in CodinGame who are rready to approve all your contributions
 Ajaiy: *ready
 macobo: Every process has failure points and trying to design for eliminating these failure points results in bureaucracy more often than not
 macobo: Piling complexity on top of complexity and whatnot
 Uljahn: it's easy to check for instantly approved low quality contributions and warn or ban those cliques of users, happend in the past already
 Wontonimo: so, are you saying we should get rid of software because it is an additional process on top of hardware&#160;?
 Wontonimo: :disappointed: tbh, I did that once.  An instant approved contrib but I'd like to say it was good quality.  The people involved actually checked it
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: space maze had a questionable moderation
 eulerscheZahl: so did this puzzle, some intersection in approvers: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/big-bang-theory---sheldons-array-puzzle">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/big-bang-theory---sheldons-array-puzzle</a>
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle itself is ok. but it's a verbatim copy of a hackerrank puzzle which is why i gave 1 star
 eulerscheZahl: wait, there was 1 change:"print it modulo 10^7 + 7"
 eulerscheZahl: original was 10^9 + 7 (which is a prime number)
 eulerscheZahl: the CG author even copied a hackerrank solution that assumed mod prime at first, thus providing wrong solutions
 Wontonimo: yeah, i hang my head in shame jacek
 Westicles: the trend lately are accounts that approve everything
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up, moderation only frustrates me
 eulerscheZahl: is it too much to expect a statement without typos in every sentence?
 Wontonimo: it seems so
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. jacek now has 41 taco
 Automaton2000: let's say you have a bug or something
 Automaton2000: you can also do that
 Westicles: I think part of the reason twitch died here is so many bad clashes approved
 Wontonimo: or the reduced frequency of multi events 
 Westicles: nah, the clash guys don't care about that
 Wontonimo: yeah, but where are the people to watch&#160;?  without the regular competitions it is pretty dead with viewers
 Wontonimo: idk, i never watch the twitch stream anyways.  you are probably right
 Wontonimo: hey, there are 8 spectators right now on the codingame twitch stream
 eulerscheZahl: i got used to all the notification circles, didn't even realize there's a stream right now
 Westicles: very exciting content
 Westicles: but the best is JBM playing with his rubik's cube for hours
 dbdr: anybody doing codejam?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up after reaching 71 points
 eulerscheZahl: last task must have some non-uniform graphs
 eulerscheZahl: some other users played codejam too
 eulerscheZahl: DomiK o linjoeha n Astro to not name a few
 dbdr: just started
 dbdr: I thought it's going for the whole weekend
 dbdr: and was busy before
 dbdr: is it long?
 eulerscheZahl: 30min max to qualify
 eulerscheZahl: you need 30 points
 dbdr: ok&#160;:)
 Westicles: heh heh
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1044435178">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1044435178</a>
 dbf: &gt; 30min max to qualify
 dbf: it is also possible to spend 1.5 hrs to qualify&#160;:)
 Westicles: hey Wontonimo, check it out he solves fax machine.   1 star
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1127874877">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1127874877</a>
 macobo: So clash of code used to have a lot of bot participants - is that still the case?
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr shouldn't take that long
 Ajaiy: wait lemme try that
 a-Rye: Hey Wontonimo, I'm preparing for a stream on my Beginner Java playground. But if you ever get bored, I try to upload all my past streams to my YouTube. This will be my second or third tutorial set for Java, but Playgrounds are much easier to explain things
 a-Rye: I mean, it's all beginner stuff for now. But when others get ideas for what would be useful to see explained, it helps 
 dbdr:  Test 1 - Apr 2 2022, 19:22SERVER ERROR
 dbdr: gg google :D
 eulerscheZahl: someone else (i think dbf) also had that at first
 eulerscheZahl: those haskell solutions always look like magic to me. first he has compiler errors and then boom, solved
 dbdr: where do you see the haskell solutions?
 dbdr: btw, looks like 35 minutes is enough to get 100 points :D
 Ajaiy: It's very easy to solve though
 eulerscheZahl: check westicle's link
 eulerscheZahl: wow, 35min for all is really solid
 eulerscheZahl: i failed the last, not sure what i'm supposed to do. but let's not get into detail while the challenge is still running
 Ajaiy: Which one?
 Ajaiy: There are two of them
 dbf: congrats, dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: oh, that's not me!
 dbdr: that's #1
 dbf: haha, lol
 dbdr: i'm doing the dice now.
 dbdr: i guess it's a pattern that the statement makes the problem look harder than it is
 dbdr: I think it will be easy, but maybe I'm missing sth :D
 dbf: dice was the easiest from #1, 2, 3 i think
 dbdr: lol
 Synergyforge: I get my wheels back from HRE today! :D  How do I get FedEx to use a shortest path algorithm to get to me as soon as possible? :D
 dbdr: I guess I'm qualified?&#160;:)
 dbf: :thumbsup_tone2:
 eulerscheZahl: &gt; oh, that's not me! that's #1
 Synergyforge: Does anyone actually use Haskell or is it just for cool points? :P
 dbdr: Astro optimized for minimal efforts it seems&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: 1 and 3 are enough for 31 points
 eulerscheZahl: oh had to use that one framework at work. technically C# but feels like haskell
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext">https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i hate it
 eulerscheZahl: good thing i could pass that project on to another poor soul
 eulerscheZahl: C# has List&lt;T&gt;so let's make out own Lst&lt;T&gt; and Seq&lt;T&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: our*
 Ajaiy: Why Lst though?
 eulerscheZahl: i still have no clue how to convert those back to standard C# collections
 dbdr: probably the worst of both worlds
 eulerscheZahl: because it follows the immutable pattern (there are immutable lists in .net too)
 dbdr: are they lazy too?
 eulerscheZahl: and when you use those over standard collections, you have .map instead of .select and such
 eulerscheZahl: so knowing C# and the .net framework doesn't help you at all with that framework
 eulerscheZahl: and the project made heavy use of it
 eulerscheZahl: also with a database that's too slow for online use. they decided to have a local copy. but no mechanics for incremental changes. takes 7 minutes just to update 2 rows
 dbdr: lol
 Synergyforge: Immutable lists are the devil's creation.
 eulerscheZahl: and when your API returns types like A&lt;B&lt;C&lt;D&gt;&gt;&gt; (nested generics), it's no fun to work with
 Ajaiy: When I was solving Death First Search, the names got as ridiculous as NeighNeighNeighs
 Ajaiy: I guess it's part of coding?
 eulerscheZahl: it's part of bad coding?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: but names are hard
 Ajaiy: I think so. My final code somehow didn't use such names
 NJX: hey guys i'm nb on code, how is the most easy tut to i made?
 Synergyforge: Uh... What?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Synergyforge, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 6 tacos
 flowerowski: print("Hello guys")
 wlesavo: heh, thx for reminder completely forgot about code jam
 wlesavo: Chain Reactions took me awhile
 Kasanji: Hi. I am doing Power of Thor (easy puzzle). Test case took me a while and not solving it. I have all 4 lines specifically for N, E, W, and S in a straight line.
 Kasanji: Third test wants me to go diagonally so I did this             else if (lightX &lt; initialTx &amp;&amp; lightY &gt; initialTy) {SW}
 Kasanji: thor kept going SW without turning to West in a straight line. What did I do wrong?
 Astrobytes: I did bare minimum to qualify for codejam as I had to go out, was gonna continue but too tired
 Astrobytes: Kasanji: are you updating thors position
 Kasanji: I still have first two test cases running correctly. 
 Astrobytes: you are updating his position with every movement though?
 Kasanji: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db596128-1f9a-4d59-8f2b-bb26c0b3a95c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db596128-1f9a-4d59-8f2b-bb26c0b3a95c</a>
 Kasanji: This is what I have on thor right now
 Astrobytes: broken, pastebins must be broken again

 Kasanji: ok uh
 Kasanji: I will try different one
 ASM_MOV_INT: just have to use copybins in the meantime
 ASM_MOV_INT: :joy: ba doom boom tsh!
 Astrobytes: yeah, pick a 'bin'
 Astrobytes: ASM_MOV_INT: groan

 Kasanji: eh
 Astrobytes: lol, the link was too long?
 Astrobytes: try hastebin or something
 Kasanji: not seeing hastebin
 Astrobytes: well, in the absence of any code, make sure you update thors x and y position every time he moves once in whatever direction
 Kasanji: lightY == initialTy &amp;&amp; initialTx &lt; lightX
 Westicles: how do they calculate penalty time?  time since you first opened the problem?
 Kasanji: System.out.println("E")
 Kasanji: I do the same for W,S, and N if they are equal respectively, and move toward to that point in a straight line.
 Astrobytes: initialTy and InitialTx need to be updated or it's as if thor never moved
 Kasanji: oh okay
 Astrobytes: Westicles: no clue, first time I tried codejam
 Astrobytes: Westicles: seems it's "It is 4 minutes for every incorrect submission of the small data set of a question"
 Kasanji: thank you. i was wondering because it does show the position is changing
 Astrobytes: from 2014, the minutes may have changed, but that seems about right
 Kasanji: Game information:Failure: Thor wandered off the path and died (invalid position).Thor position = (17,18). Light position = (0,17). Energy = 31
 Westicles: oh I see, normally it is time from start of contest
 Astrobytes: Kasanji: it will tell you where thor ended up and his current position but in the code you have to track it yourself
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I think it's for tiebreaking purposes anyway
 Astrobytes: time from start of contest is a little harsh unless it's running for a specific timezone surely
 AdidasHoodie: hello
 Westicles: Astrobytes, probably too tempting to cheat otherwise
 CoolandonRS: Is there an easy way to reorder test cases?
 Westicles: I am highly ethical like you so don't understand the need :P
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Nik05: Westicles i just did your balls puzzle, can't i submit my solution?

 Nik05: Maybe rename to touching testicles
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Nik05: That is allowed :P
 Astrobytes: I strongly approve
 StaplesCoding: I approve
 Astrobytes: anyway, goodnight/day all
 Nik05: Have a goodnight Astrobytes
 Westicles: Nik05, you can't submit a solution until it is approved
 Westicles: oh wait, it is a clash, so you never can...
 Magmi: balls

 Wontonimo: seriously&#160;?  trying to provoke the bad word detection?  shame on all of you
 Wontonimo: keep it up and I'll kick you
 Nerchio: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: lol, are you weighing the options of provoking the bad word detection vs being kicked Nerchio&#160;?
 Nerchio: I don't provoke anything, it's just a bad bot.
 Westicles: better kick whoever sent this

 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: Nerchio , there was a rash of 13 yr olds who were just spamming that particular word.  it's not a bad bot, it really cut down on that behaviour
 Nerchio: just because it solved one problem doesn't mean it didn't create more
 Wontonimo: okay mr negative, propose a solution
 Magmi: a big tyranny on this site when this word is banned
 Nerchio: having an opinion doesn't mean being mr negative
 Magmi: baIIs
 Magmi: it got unbanned now
 Westicles: this is all Astros fault
 Nik05: Westicles damn that is a clash, well guess it can be written a lot shorter...
 Wontonimo: baIIs baIIs ... yeah, see, it doesn't mind when I say it either.  It's just people who are rude about it
 Magmi: why you ban the word and not the people
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 Synergyforge: Decriminalize all words! :D
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Synergyforge, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 7 tacos
 ASM_MOV_INT: decriminalize minecraft
 ASM_MOV_INT: and tacos.  i want minecraft and taco freedom, who's with me?
 Synergyforge: I bought two copies of Minecraft years ago when it was like 37 cents.  :P  I haven't played in a while but  I enjoyed exploring and building worlds with my gf at the time.  My current gf doesn't even play games.&#160;:(
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Synergyforge, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 8 tacos
 Nik05: How do you get tacos?
 Synergyforge: You have to perform a ritual to the taco gods.
 Nik05: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Nik05, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos

 linjoehan: give
 ASM_MOV_INT: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 NonVeganTeacherFan: hi antiwonto
 Synergyforge: Can haz taco?
 Erinengmullen: How do you loop through an array to find the highest value 
 Synergyforge: Sometimes, there are built-ins you can use, but that is kind of cheating.  Try setting a variable outside of the loop to something like 0 or negative infinity, then on every iteration of the loop, compare the current value to the highest value variable you set earlier.
 Synergyforge: Then set the var to the current value if it's greater.
 Husoski: Make the starting max value the first value of the sequence.  That doesn't need a separate "infinity" value.
 Synergyforge: Yeah if you just create an empty var, but sometimes that's not possible/optimal.
 Synergyforge: You need the variable to be instantiated outside of the loop, and the implementation could determine how you do that.

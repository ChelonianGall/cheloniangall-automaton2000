 miszu: Hey guys, how do you handle GC issue in java? Sometimes my GC takes 90ms out of the 100ms allocated for my AI to find the  best move. Would recycling objects help significantly?
 tekki: whati s GC issue AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same as the project?
 tekki: shut up AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the main thing?
 miszu: GC is garbage collector
 tekki: okmiszu
 tekki: but i can't help you&#160;:)
 miszu: It's alright. It just a  bummer you spent so much time coding but the majority of time your running time is spent on GC
 rohit09: :P
 jacek: still GC issues? maybe dont create so many objects in a loop
 MSmits: miszu use object pools
 kamiathe: hi
 kamiathe: some have a good antivirus to block pop_ups on windows 10 pls?
 AntiSquid: browser pop ups&#160;?
 AntiSquid: kamiathe
 kamiathe: yep webside sometime redirect me towerd pop-ups which can happen to me anyware
 tehsphinx: miszu: you are simply using the wrong language :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 EquinoxWhale: kamiathe, you should use an adblocker like ublock origin
 kamiathe: yep thx someone tell me the same just now ^^
 AntiSquid: ublock origin works on youtube ads too
 AntiSquid: which is why it's so good
 dbdr: ublock origin :thumbsup:
 kamiathe: thx i put this ^^ i'll say if the issue continu
 AntiSquid: ya i can tell you now, there's an issue with sites that detect adblock and ask you to disable it, for those sites i use noscript kamiathe, never turn off add block!
 Liawe: How to check the questions of previous competitions?
 Uljahn: you mean clashes?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: such competitions wow
 AntiSquid: previous competitions are all in the multiplayer game section now
 Automaton2000: there is a limit on how many people have done it
 AntiSquid: Liawe
 Uljahn: AntiSquid: he is lvl 3 so highly likely a coc addict
 AntiSquid: another one? we have too many of those here
 Uljahn: too bad for them google doesn't provide recaptcha in china
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't spend my last days on earth playing coc
 Uljahn: but the last one staying could grab all the fame&#160;:)
 Uljahn: ah, there are official bots though
 Uljahn: i'll spend my last days on uttt, how's your XR AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: try to go beyond depth 3 before i give up and use a smitsi or a decoupled mcts 
 AntiSquid: i mean &gt; depth3 minimax
 AntiSquid: but overall, it's shit
 AntiSquid: i tried all of the evals on the forums, i don't know why half of them don't work for me at all
 AntiSquid: i mean the ones in the xr thread
 Uljahn: XR is my next when i'll have enough of uttt in a year or two
 AntiSquid: heh
 AntiSquid: 1-2 years on uttt?
 Uljahn: jk
 Pouria2100: c++ is best
 Pouria2100: language ever
 Pouria2100: better that java , python , c# ...
 Pouria2100: you can do every thing that you want
 AntiSquid: ya i might finish in 1-2 years at the pace i am going at Uljahn
 MSmits: AntiSquid, do you know if your sim is perfect?
 MSmits: also which language?
 Pouria2100: :laughing:
 Pouria2100: i know c++ is best you too?
 MSmits: ah i see you're in gold with c++
 MSmits: I'm pretty lazy at checking sim, sometimes I find mistakes when I am in top 10 already =/
 Pouria2100: wow
 Pouria2100: r u kidding?
 MSmits: obviously not big mistakes, but still
 dbdr: sometimes a faster but incorrect sim is better
 MSmits: yes, but then it is by choice
 MSmits: my mistakes are accidental :P
 dbdr: it can still better&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: it's the worst when you find a mistake, fix it and then it performs wors
 MSmits: I really hate that
 MSmits: is something weird going on with CG or do I have some rare timeout bug again
 MSmits: getting on averahe 1-2 crashes per 100 games, but none on local
 MSmits: and when I crash my timer sometimes says 45 ms (so within limit) and it still timeouts
 MSmits: and sometimes it says 65 ms, which is way beyond the timeout
 Pouria2100: MSMITS what is your idea about best language?
 MSmits: use the right tool for the job Pouria2100, there is no best
 Pouria2100: for big projects
 MSmits: I dont do big projects
 MSmits: so no idea
 Pouria2100: small?
 MSmits: depends on what it is
 Pouria2100: mathematic
 MSmits: if you're solving a puzzle within a coding time limit, python or similar
 MSmits: if you need performance, c++ or similar
 MSmits: if somewhere in between, then C#, java etc.
 Uljahn: btw what sim were you talking about? like both push and moves in XR? because i made some numpy push sim and thinking about implementing pathfinding with bitboards from MSmits's playground
 Pouria2100: no that's not right
 MSmits: Uljahn i meant the push and move sim. Checking it with unit tests
 Pouria2100: and what do mean 'performance'
 MadKnight: u can't do properties in c++ Pouria2100
 Uljahn: i see, thanks
 MSmits: number of calculations per second Pouria2100
 MadKnight: and u can't doobj?-&gt;x
 Pouria2100: :no_mouth:
 Pouria2100: but still c++ is best
 Pouria2100: some thing u can't do in java
 Pouria2100: for example
 Pouria2100: operator overloading"using" declarativeauto keywordreference variables
 MSmits: then use C#
 Pouria2100: Pointer arithmeticReal generic programming (templates)
 Pouria2100: c# is not useful
 MSmits: if you're doing pointer arithmetic, you're probably not in a time limited situation
 Pouria2100: for my works
 MSmits: in that situation, if you need performance, of course c++ is better
 Pouria2100: no time is not limited
 MSmits: if you just want to build an app and build it as fast as possible, c++ is a bad choice
 Pouria2100: and not fast as possible
 Pouria2100: just can do it 
 MSmits: well I think there are other languages, just as fast as c++
 Pouria2100: just be easy to make it
 MSmits: rust and such
 Pouria2100: :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: they are less bogged down by backward compatibility and compiler difference
 Pouria2100: ok tnx 
 MSmits: because c++ is old
 Pouria2100:&#160;????!
 MSmits: but sure, it's super fast and i dont know any other fast language, so i use it
 Pouria2100: and not too old
 MSmits: but if i knew rust, i might use that instead
 Pouria2100: what language you know?
 Uljahn: if you think c++ can easily solve any problem why are you still lvl 5? :thinking:
 MSmits: which is why i still prefer C# over python
 MSmits: Uljahn he is spending his time telling us c++ is great, is why :P
 Pouria2100: its 2 days ago with this site
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: if you're looking for a challenge, go do some arenas
 MSmits: if you're just looking to solve some puzzles, then do that
 MSmits: some are pretty hard too
 Pouria2100: for sure , i think is perfect for chall and puzzle
 Pouria2100: (PYTHON)
 MSmits: if you're good with c++ it is. But c++ has a very steep learning curve
 MSmits: python you just start and you can solve puzzles after an hour, if you've coded before
 Pouria2100: :smirk:
 MSmits: I was on vacation last summer for a week and because I need less sleep than my wife ooes, I solved 30 puzzles in python during that week
 MSmits: never really coded python before that
 Pouria2100: ok ko
 MSmits: I had to learn it for work
 MSmits: CG is a great excuse to learn
 MSmits: or better, learnign python is a great excuse to do some puzzles
 sasuke.programmer: does anyone know some good websites/ free courses for learning web development/ programming languages?
 sasuke.programmer: :slight_smile:
 Elioh: yea man
 Elioh: freecodecamp
 Elioh: code.org
 Elioh: w3
 AntiSquid: oh ya w3schools is amazing wiki for coding
 Elioh: yesss indeed
 10100111001: hey&#160;:)
 10100111001: is there a way to archive files in such a way that they extract to a specific folder
 10100111001: irregardless of where you extract them
 MadKnight: yea if u manage to make it write absolute path
 MadKnight: are u trying to make an installer archive&#160;?
 10100111001: how do I do that?
 MadKnight: what are u trying to do? an installer?
 MadKnight: u need to unpack some dll's&#160;?
 10100111001: no. it's an assignment and we're required to archive some files 
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/switches/spf.htm">https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/switches/spf.htm</a>
 MadKnight: google is for the weak, Automaton2000
 10100111001: then have them extract to /var/www i think
 Automaton2000: did you make your own bot
 10100111001: ty ty
 10100111001: Automaton2000 still lives :O
 Automaton2000: if i go to the middle of the night
 MadKnight: why wouldn't he, 10100111001&#160;?
 Pouria2100: you mean 10100111001?
 Pouria2100: or ยง
 CSharp_Sama: oop
 CSharp_Sama: I FINALLY DID ASCII ART
 CSharp_Sama: LETS GOOOO
 CSharp_Sama: Can you webscrape with Coding game?
 CocoThePimp: hi guys what's up here&#160;? What CG are you doing&#160;?
 CocoThePimp: Automaton2000 what's uuuup&#160;?
 Automaton2000: but it's just a matter of time
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: stop wasting your time and use this free pass to CSB gold
 Automaton2000: or i don't know why i don't get the same results
 Astrobytes: fix your velocity Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how i do it in bash
 CSharp_Sama: :joy:
 CSharp_Sama: Automaton2000 you're pretty funny
 Automaton2000: if i had to do it for us
 CocoThePimp: Automaton2000 reboot
 Automaton2000: it's not like i know how to code this
 daffie: did I miss the contest? I totally remember it being march 8?
 Astrobytes: daffie, nah it's delayed
 itay121: how???
 itay121: hotocoto share your code plz
 Astrobytes: Yea, daffie, only 59 days to go
 daffie: okay xD thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 xhalo: yo

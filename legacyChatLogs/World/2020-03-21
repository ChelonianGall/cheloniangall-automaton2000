 eulerscheZahl: mostly G-Rom
 Zenoscave: Well thank you G-Rom then
 Zenoscave: I like it a lot
 MostComplicatedUsername: G-Rom???
 MostComplicatedUsername: Confused
 eulerscheZahl: CG staff
 dbdr: you guys speaking too early, I was confused why i did not get a log for day. I split at 4m UTC :D
 eulerscheZahl: 4 milli or 4 millions?
 dbdr: 4am, sry
 Zenoscave: lol
 dbdr: I guessed that's a quiet time on the chat
 eulerscheZahl: it was
 dbdr: probably not during contests :D
 eulerscheZahl: before the contest
 dbdr: I woke up earlier than normal, wonder why&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: still very few in bronze
 dbdr: yes, it's unusual right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Waffle3z: I got out of wood by spamming torpedos to eliminate potential enemy positions
 dbdr: well, it's a marathon, better than too easy
 eulerscheZahl: wood should be easy, otherwise higher bosses are the same strength as for lower leagues or really strong
 eulerscheZahl: let's see how this works out
 MostComplicatedUsername: If my opponent surfaces, how will I know where they are?
 eulerscheZahl: read the statement
 Waffle3z: it tells you what sector they're in, like SURFACE 3
 eulerscheZahl: the table&#160;;)
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ohhhhh I didn't see that
 MostComplicatedUsername: I was looking at the "Game input" section
 Waffle3z: which actions can be done simultaneously? can I do everything at the same time if they're all charged?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i messed up a space on SONAR in the table
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure on SURFACE tbh
 eulerscheZahl: the rest can be done in parallel
 Waffle3z: what about MOVE N 1|SILENCE N 4
 eulerscheZahl: test it
 Waffle3z: can I drop a mine and trigger it in the same turn?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: as stated
 Waffle3z: just says you can't trigger more than one mine at once
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's not&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Waffle3z: would be a cool 4 damage in 1 turn if I could torpedo somebody, drop a mine on them and blow it up all at once
 Waffle3z: even better if they're trapped and need to surface
 dbdr: instakill
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC intensifies
 stormKx18: cool a new contest, thanks eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: my part was the smallest actually
 dbdr: listed fist
 dbdr: oh, is it random?
 dbdr: saw Illeda first before
 eulerscheZahl: alphabetical order
 eulerscheZahl: e, G, I
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/challenge/ocean-of-code.tsv">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/challenge/ocean-of-code.tsv</a>
 eulerscheZahl: how often do you plan to index?
 dbdr: hum, pretty sure Illedan was first yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 eulerscheZahl: i like the agent ID in that table
 dbdr: :smiling_imp:
 dbdr: I normally do once a day, but I just hacked the code to support a challenge
 dbdr: how often do you suggest?
 eulerscheZahl: shrugs
 eulerscheZahl: time to start a bot for me
 dbdr: for one month, once a day is not day
 dbdr: *not bad
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your intention
 dbdr: yes, you look weird in wood1 with NA rank&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: SaiksyApo promoted me
 dbdr: I know
 dbdr: mostly intention is to have the historical data, probably do a nice graph at some point
 eulerscheZahl: so not finding hiders who occasionally submit
 eulerscheZahl: then it's fine
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand: when i leave the tab open, it's a request every minute or soso traffic wise it's acceptable to do it more often
 dbdr: well, I have something fancy do deal with submits in progress
 dbdr: so I don't add noise to the data
 dbdr: so it's a few requests, not one. but still light in for sure
 dbdr: WTIT was so quick to get to bronze
 dbdr: but his bot is broken&#160;:(
 dbdr: can't think he's hiding
 dbdr: way too early to make sense
 dbdr: he just goes north until he crashes :D
 Waffle3z: sounds like wood 2 boss
 dbdr: you got in before it was fixed?
 Waffle3z: yes
 dbdr: the real one was hard
 Waffle3z: sounds hard, wood 1 was hard
 dbdr: when I passed it, I got to the top of wood 1  immediately
 Waffle3z: wood 2 is just wood 1 without sonar? so a bit easier but still all that logic is required to beat it
 Waffle3z: I mean without silence
 eulerscheZahl: without SONAR *and* SILENCE
 eulerscheZahl: but the boss doesn't use SONAR
 dbdr: no silence for sure. I don't know if it's the same boss code
 eulerscheZahl: same boss code
 eulerscheZahl: checks cooldown and ignores skills with -1
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise charges 1 skill randomly
 dbdr: clean
 Waffle3z: just tracking the possible positions by simulating the moves from every possible spawn was my first step, but wood 1 boss uses silence so I immediately had to go the next step and add more possible positions every time they silence
 eulerscheZahl: for the boss SILENCE is always 1 cellbut real players might do different
 Waffle3z: yeah it's also good for fast travel, I just wonder if it can be combined with MOVE to go even faster
 eulerscheZahl: test it, i don't know
 dbdr: read the source, luke
 Waffle3z: can I charge the torpedo from 2 to 3 and then fire it in the same turn, like MOVE N TORPEDO|TORPEDO 0 0
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Waffle3z: SILENCE E 1|MOVE E did work
 Waffle3z: pro gamer move: charge SILENCE immediately after using it
 Waffle3z: MOVE N|MOVE N does not work
 Waffle3z: that would have been fun
 anid: @eulerscheZahl are you allowed to participate?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Waffle3z: the creators' insider info advantage probably goes away pretty early
 eulerscheZahl: i have an "advantage" of 2 days, which isn't a real advantage as i didn't even find time to write a bot
 eulerscheZahl: and we are still tracking bugs and reading the chat during the contest, so it's actually a disadvantage
 anid: I just started, what does sonar result actually give?
 eulerscheZahl: true or falseyou can guess, if the opponent is in a sector of your choice
 anid: So it checks which sector?
 dbdr: reading the chat might be an advantage&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: it checks, it it is in a sector or not
 eulerscheZahl: it won't tell you the right sector out of 9 possible
 dbdr: unless you use the secret "SONAR&#160;?" command
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is mean, he just killed me&#160;:/
 reCurse: sayori please stop inviting me to clash
 reCurse: I won't ever play that
 dbdr: reCurse how do you like the game?
 sayori: but i refuse
 reCurse: You've spammed me like 50 invites in the past 2 weeks
 reCurse: Please stop
 sayori: okayokay i am sorry
 reCurse: Thanks
 sayori: i wont do that again
 eulerscheZahl: i hate that "feature" of invites
 sayori: why
 eulerscheZahl: there is no "unsubscribe" or however to should be called
 reCurse: dbdr I get the feeling the game will get stale
 reCurse: Either that or I have a hard time motivating myself on CG anymore
 reCurse: Not saying it's a bad game though
 Waffle3z: why are you always at the top of the invite list
 reCurse: But I'm pretty sure it will end up just like utg
 dbdr: has some similarities with UTG in that guessing opponent moves is crucial
 dbdr: meaning?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's a better for for a marathon than locam wasbut still a little too long for my taste
 eulerscheZahl: better fit for*
 reCurse: Don't want to diss locam but
 reCurse: I think any other game would be better suited for a marathon
 reCurse: Guessing games mean a very volatile meta
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: no dominant search, more like RPS
 reCurse: So do I feel like plugging holes for a month straight
 eulerscheZahl: which can be exhausting if you play it for 4 weeks
 dbdr: locam was august. it was nice doing it casually
 eulerscheZahl: unrelated:i just checked my profile settings to see if i can block CoC inviteswhat does "METTRE A JOUR" mean and why is it in French?
 reCurse: Update
 reCurse: And because localization is hard
 eulerscheZahl: clicking it reloaded the page, RIP chat history
 Waffle3z: MSG for the player on the right is off the screen

 eulerscheZahl: known issue
 anid: Is  MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO X Y allowed?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 anid: Can you get hurt by your own torpedoes?
 dbdr: yes
 Uljahn: is reading the rules allowed?
 anid: Comp has a small screen only half of each sentence of the rules is visible
 dbdr: anid maybe you can read it easier here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/config/statement_en.html.tpl">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/config/statement_en.html.tpl</a>
 anid: thanks
 gopigopi096: can anyone give solutoin
 eulerscheZahl: solution for what?
 AntiSquid: to life
 jthemphill: smitsimax is just MCTS with two trees, where you need to combine two nodes together to get one game state, useful for simultaneous decision games... right?
 AntiSquid: ya something like that
 jthemphill: cool
 eulerscheZahl: and noone outside of CG will understand that word
 jthemphill: we should write a wikipedia article about it
 jthemphill: nose goes
 AntiSquid: problem is the algo already exists under a different name
 AntiSquid: you can't just rename it .
 jthemphill: but... the other name is "CadiaPlayer: A Simulation-Based General Game Player"
 AntiSquid: smitsi is CG slang
 AntiSquid: i think you can also call it decoupled mcts
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/cig14-smmctsggp.pdf">http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/cig14-smmctsggp.pdf</a>
 jthemphill: sure, we can go with that
 jthemphill: and then link the smitsimax article
 AntiSquid: that mentions some simultaneous mcts variants
 jthemphill: neat, bookmarking
 Nixerrr: afaik, it isn't the exact same thing as decoupled MCTS
 AntiSquid: i have the feeling you're biased towards naming it smitsimax because you first familiarized yourself with that name
 Nixerrr: I'm not super familiar with either, but I know that ms is often too humble about his own achievements
 Nixerrr: so it's probably different and novel enough to at least merit its own name
 AntiSquid: well then again a lot of papers present something as new but there's only a small difference being presented ... 
 Nixerrr: AntiSquid just noticed you're a mod now :O
 AntiSquid: ya w/e
 AntiSquid: kids started dodging chat a lot more now it seems 
 Nixerrr: :ok_hand:
 AntiSquid: ah and with schools being closed there will be even less "e-vandalism"
 Nixerrr: Could be, yeah
 jthemphill: CG always seemed pretty high-quality, though i guess maybe that's just because of the mods
 AntiSquid: no
 jthemphill: k
 Nixerrr: :smile_cat:
 AntiSquid: except for Madao imo
 jthemphill: :grimacing:
 <b>**Nixerrr is googline Captain Sonar Tactics Guide</b></p><p><img src="/a/25886476520293" /> Nixerrr: *googling
 eulerscheZahl: did you sleep last night Nixerrr?
 Nixerrr: I did&#160;:( I'm such a loser
 eulerscheZahl: and you got an easy promotion with the broken boss
 eulerscheZahl: i still have no idea how that could happen
 Nixerrr: Haha yeah, that was a nice surprise
 dbdr: you missed the achivement feeling of beating it&#160;;)
 dbdr: was far from trivial
 AntiSquid: which boss was broken?
 eulerscheZahl: at least he got the XP
 eulerscheZahl: all bosses
 AntiSquid: oh .
 eulerscheZahl: we had a test contribution, worked fine
 Nixerrr: I do feel bad for beating wood 2 without reading the statement
 eulerscheZahl: somehow the contest had a different boss code
 AntiSquid: val growth finally promoted
 eulerscheZahl: strong player, i had no doubts that he will make it
 AntiSquid: the issue was he was stuck above the boss not below ... no matter how strong the bug still got him
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: broken leaderboard?
 AntiSquid: there was a bug with promotion
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: that would suck on a sprint :D
 AntiSquid: he was at 42 points, boss at 40
 <b>**dbdr recalls locam sprint</b></p><p><img src="/a/26108015239233" /> AntiSquid: stuck like that for a long time
 eulerscheZahl: #jp chat is boring
 dbdr: are you trying random country codes? :D
 dbdr: anything to avoid improving your bot?
 AntiSquid: no chat till legend
 AntiSquid: how are you Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you'd need to have a higher score
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i have an opponent tracker now
 AntiSquid: so who made the bosses if you are in wood&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: G-Rom started long ago
 eulerscheZahl: i pepped them up a bit
 eulerscheZahl: like using torpedoes without being 100% sure about the opponent position
 eulerscheZahl: educated guessing, there are only a few possible candidates after a few turns
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: lockdown, every day is caturday now
 yfprojects: Don't you do homeoffice?
 AntiSquid: work from home?
 yfprojects: Are you asking me? @AntiSquid
 T-Rone: hello everyone
 AntiSquid: was asking Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: now i just need to be in the input
 Uljahn: if opponent_orders == "SUMMON Automaton2000": print('Panic!')
 Automaton2000: so i changed it to
 AntiSquid: Call of Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: can you be sure astrobytes, you have the same score
 MSmits: how do you guys determine where to move? I don't have much trouble to write an opponent tracker, but movement logic is diffeent
 MSmits: different
 eulerscheZahl: go where you haven't been beforeor you will lose
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's too early for that question
 MSmits: hmm ok, well that's as far as I got also :P
 eulerscheZahl: later on you will try to obfuscate your own position
 MSmits: I really do things in a different order i guess
 MSmits: I spent hours getting all bitboards ready and write an opponent tracker, but my bot cant move yet :P
 eulerscheZahl: bitboards again, i'm not surprised :D
 MSmits: do you have an array of integers for map? Or an array of cell objects?
 eulerscheZahl: public static Cell[,] Grid;
 MSmits: ahh ok
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ab0ff50-5f65-4ccb-88b7-6e973f37ec10">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ab0ff50-5f65-4ccb-88b7-6e973f37ec10</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm more on the OOP side than optimizing for performance
 MSmits: honestly, I am not optimizing performance. I don't think I'll need it much
 MSmits: If you work with the bits all day, doing anything else becomes awkward 
 MSmits: uint16_t islands[15] = { 0 };uint16_t invertedIslands[15] = { 0 };uint16_t visited[15] = { 0 };uint16_t oppMap[15] = { 0 };
 eulerscheZahl: as you can't see me right now: i'm facepalming despite corona
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: we have emotes, no need to risk your health&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not scared by the virus at all
 AntiSquid: the entire thing is a bit exaggerated .
 MSmits: me neither, just careful, also, use common sense. It's not in your home and if it is, it is in you first
 eulerscheZahl: i'm young and healthy, will knock me out for a week or 2 maybe, not a huge deal
 Schneewittchen: Can we win a set of toilet paper in this contest?
 AntiSquid: imo if it was as serious as the drama in the news wants to make you believe, then millions would have died in china, 100% sure
 MSmits: thats highly likely but not certain eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: highly likely is enough
 AntiSquid: and there's no way they would have covered up millions of deaths in china .
 eulerscheZahl: it's not certain that i survive crossing the street either
 MSmits: AntiSquid the problem is mostly the humanitarian crisis at the hospitals
 AntiSquid: ya some nutter might drive into the sidewalk
 MSmits: you cant even hospitalize 0,1% of the population
 MSmits: the fatality rate is much less important than the crisis at the hospitals
 AntiSquid: even at the hospital it's nowhere near as dramatic as they make it out to be
 MSmits: maybe in the uk
 MSmits: in Italy many died because they couldnt even get help
 MSmits: thats why they have a higher fatality rate than China does
 AntiSquid: it takes 3 days to get test results in UK btw 
 MSmits: dont forget that China worked hard at containing it
 MSmits: if they hadnt, millions *would* be dead
 AntiSquid: there might be thousands of "silent carriers"
 MSmits: millions
 MSmits: maybe in UK, about 100k or more right now
 AntiSquid: 100% doubt it MSmits, the gov tried to keep it silent for at least a month in china
 MSmits: I am guessing 100k here too
 MSmits: AntiSquid look at the graphs though, the asian countries that used heavy measures were far more succesful than we were
 AntiSquid: also china is opening up everything, only worries are the foreigners going to china or people returning
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: it's been a long time for them though
 MSmits: first case in december
 MSmits: basically you only need to do two things, make sure you have the hospital capability and protect the elderly/weak
 dbdr: the thing is, even if we are healthy and not at risk, not getting infected helps other people who are at risk
 MSmits: unless you take it too far dbdr
 dbdr: sure, anything can be taken too far
 MSmits: if noone gets infected, the people who are at risk, will be at risk for years
 AntiSquid: covid afaik is from the same family as SARS and MERS .
 dbdr: e.g. stopping to breathe is taking it too far&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes AntiSquid
 MSmits: a corona virus
 AntiSquid: it's still low on the scale of deadliness
 dbdr: I think that risk is not very high right now
 dbdr: given the speed of spread
 MSmits: again, the fatality rate is not the issue, people focus on that too much
 MSmits: it's the fact that many people end up in hospital being held in coma and using a respirator
 MSmits: multiple weeks
 MSmits: they cant have thousands like that
 dbdr: exactly
 yfprojects: do you know which effect OOP has on the performance in python or java?
 AntiSquid: overall there's shit ton of panic and most people don't understand what's going on, everyone just assumes shit ... you hear crap like "you maybe had covid actually and not the flu" from medical staff that are far from being virologists
 eulerscheZahl: python alone has a negative effect on performance, no matter if OOP or not
 eulerscheZahl: in Java everything is OOP, no main function outside of a class
 dbdr: AntiSquid: "maybe" is correct
 dbdr: ask Italy if it's overestimated
 yfprojects: But in java you can have one or many classes
 dbdr: but panic is not useful. just taking it seriously
 AntiSquid: hard to write down the tone and the context of the entire conversation .
 eulerscheZahl: but ofc primitives are faster than classes with lots of dereferencing
 eulerscheZahl: Board.Grid.Cell[x][y] is slower than a more direct access
 MSmits: AntiSquid if you dont get pneumonia, corona is pretty much like a bad cold or a flu, or even a weak cold in some cases
 yfprojects: So I should program in Java instead of Python? @eulerscheZahl
 Uljahn: python has numpy
 eulerscheZahl: C#or C++ if I really need the speed
 eulerscheZahl: C# for convenience
 AntiSquid: w/e all i see is a bad movie plot: Toilet-Paper-Zombie-Apocalypse
 dbdr: Rust for both :innocent:
 eulerscheZahl: it's called mummy then
 MSmits: haha yeah
 MSmits: the mummy apocalypse
 MSmits: to be fair, i dont think the egyptians used toilet paper :P
 eulerscheZahl: papyrus?
 AntiSquid: there's hand sanitizer at every door / entrance ... didn't take long to almost run out. the one at the main entrance was completely empty when i arrived at the hospital, people were basically touching the same surface to squeeze out some sanitizer not getting anything out .
 AntiSquid: that just spreads germs more efficiently
 MSmits: ye, people dont think about that
 MSmits: i would like some sanitizer, just to use after leaving the train station
 MSmits: I dont even mean just because of corona :P
 AntiSquid: well they could easily afford that in england considering how much they charge ... geez
 MSmits: well they dont make much money now 
 eulerscheZahl: charge TORPEDO
 MSmits: :fearful:
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, i have to do it 3 times
 MSmits: oh
 eulerscheZahl: and my tracker is incomplete, so i will likely miss you
 MSmits: btw, I havent played a full game yet, my bot is still crashing, but it seems to  me, the possible locations for the opponent at the start is very large, but as the game goes on, you'll usually have a small area he might be in right'/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: surface only lights up  1 sector
 MSmits: and silence takes time to charge
 eulerscheZahl: yes, but with silence it still goes up
 AntiSquid: ya bit annoying to take into consideration everything and start over every turn eliminating impossible positions
 eulerscheZahl: and you have to plan your path to be able to attack when you found your opponent
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's not what I am worried about, my update function should just handle that automatically, but actually knowing what to do with the information is a different problem
 AntiSquid: a lot of CR vibes here
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl if you plan to attack him, you also better be sure he can't attack you back, considering you need to get close
 MSmits: could also just stay back as far as possible
 MSmits: and let him come
 MSmits: it's a symmetrical game after all
 AntiSquid: back in CR there was also a lot of stuff to keep track of, funny they released the games at the same time
 MSmits: yeah it's weird
 eulerscheZahl: not 100% symmetrical
 eulerscheZahl: when the opponent hasn't loaded a torpedo yet
 eulerscheZahl: mines can be interesting too
 dbdr: 1,295 CodinGamers have registered to this contest
 MSmits: hmm you know when he has a torpedo, thats true
 dbdr: 254 submitted
 dbdr: is this typical?
 AntiSquid: guess they are stuck
 eulerscheZahl: yesbut usually a contest is announced long before
 MSmits: submitted is too early to tell
 MSmits: I havent submitted
 dbdr: stuck where?
 AntiSquid: in the IDE
 MSmits: stuck on getting a working bot
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: so it still surprised me that there is such a gap between registered and submitted
 MSmits: it's the easiest contest
 MSmits: not
 dbdr: help! I'm stuck in an IDE
 AntiSquid: i expect many don't submit until they have a win vs boss
 MSmits: thats true, thats what i do
 dbdr: depends how many people don't submit until they beat the boss
 dbdr: right, and this boss is hard
 MSmits: also people might just read the e-mail from codingame, then register, read the statement and go to bed
 AntiSquid: a lot to take in imo
 yfprojects: MSmits thats exactly what i have done
 MSmits: I know, you left your webcam on.
 MSmits: which reminds me, I still need to do my internet security homework&#160;:(
 yfprojects: Which webcam?
 AntiSquid: wow extra security guards hired to "combat" stockpilers :D
 AntiSquid: in supermarkets
 MSmits: I was kidding yfprojects :P
 yfprojects: I know, because i don't have a webcam
 MSmits: sometimes they are hard to see
 MSmits: part of your laptop 
 AntiSquid: hoarders are mental patients basically
 MSmits: ye
 Illedan: HI
 yfprojects: i don't use my laptop and i have taped the cam of it anyways .
 MSmits: is it white tape?
 MSmits: that would explain the whitish stuff I had to remove to get a clear image

 yfprojects: Its white but my laptop is closed. But nice try! :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: yfprojects i think the joke was a bit creepier than you think . hint&#160;: he had to remove some stuff on his end ... 
 lvlzyro: you know because of that virus thing we have to stay home and this place is great to spend time.
 lvlzyro: so have fun!
 eulerscheZahl: that virus thing is the reason for the contest
 MSmits: err AntiSquid, I didnt even think of that :P
 AntiSquid: then what were you thinking of removing? lol .
 MSmits: I was suggesting the white tape on his camera was partially transparent and I could digitally remove it
 MSmits: but now that I think of it, dirty minds like yours would be more likely to interpret it differently :P
 MSmits: as would probably every student of mine that happens to be on chat right now =/
 <b>**MSmits needs to be more careful</b></p><p><img src="/a/26108015239233" /> AntiSquid: ya ok whatever, shift the blame on someone else
 yfprojects: You are lucky, I didnt think of that
 MSmits: good
 MSmits: would be good to floodfill movement right?
 MSmits: to make sure you dont get stuck in a corner?
 MSmits: tron-style
 eulerscheZahl: but that makes you easier to be tracked
 MSmits: well I dont mean tron style depth 18
 MSmits: just to make sure you can still go to every unvisited place after moving
 Slash-Dev: I think the next checkpoint angle is broken. I get 1494 or 7509 values.
 MSmits: I think your code is broken 
 MSmits: probably you just promoted and you need to reset your code to the new league
 MSmits: make a copy, reset code, put relevant code back in
 MSmits: but keep the input code of the new league
 Slash-Dev: Oh indeed. Sorry about that...
 eulerscheZahl: always the same parts that users are struggling withthe change in the input format makes CSB a bad tutorial
 MSmits: it is
 MSmits: you're right
 JavaMan: Hello World
 JFB: Hello JavaMan
 AntiSquid:  :thinking: that's where Java got its name

 JFB: Time to sturt the contest&#160;:-)
 WildSmilodon: Hey guys, I'm making my multiplayer game and after deploying on CodinGame, I can't make images appear in the statement. I prepared the statement_en.html in the config folder and added png's there
 WildSmilodon: Simply adding them in plain html doesnt work, since when deployed one sees "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/costs.png">https://www.codingame.com/costs.png</a>" for my image "costs.png".
 WildSmilodon: From the example game skeleton it seems one should  use "/fileservlet?id=", but how do I get the id's for my images? Thanks for your help.
 eulerscheZahl: you need an external source like imgur
 eulerscheZahl: or your github repo where you host the code
 WildSmilodon: oh, ok, cool. Thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible to get the idsbut on a new upload they may changeand again when the game gets approved, not sure
 eulerscheZahl: maybe use github and not imgursome users complained about imgur being blocked at their working place
 eulerscheZahl: and they seem bored at the job :D
 WildSmilodon: I will use github, I will put the game source files there anyway.
 JFB: Question not connected with CG. What staf do you use for conferenece? I know MS Team, Zoom. For example you have talk with 4+ peopses, discuss presentations and other visual stuff, it will be good to see faces. And people are on very different level of computer skills 
 eulerscheZahl: we use curcuit at workbut that totally doesn't mean that i recommend it
 yfprojects: Skype and MSTeam, I suppose
 WildSmilodon: MS Teams is what I use to give lectures these days. It works great, even with 80+ students listening
 eulerscheZahl: we'll probably switch to skype for business
 emh: hah.. I seeded rng statically for reproducability, so always starting at same point. should seed based on map I guess
 JFB: Do google have such service or not? 
 WildSmilodon: Yes, google has "meet"
 Illedan: I'm seeding on map emh. Got crazy before doing that :P
 emh: hehe&#160;:)
 dbdr: emh yes, otherwise people can target you specifically
 Illedan: Now they might target his seed :o
 dbdr: makes them waste more time
 dbdr: if they find, change the method in 5 seconds
 Illedan: heh
 ShanYouMuXi: I got my first first place in clash of  code:joy:
 JFB: So: team, skype, zoom, meet. I have used skype and zoom (once) only. WildSmilodon - in team do students can ask ypu questions (speak to you)? Do yo see their faces? And do they see each other?
 Lks10: congrats
 WildSmilodon: Yes, they can talk, use chat or use whiteboard
 WildSmilodon: But, when you have this many, I ask them to turn off their mikes and use chat
 Rd211: ayy got 8th place in ocean of code
 JFB: Rd211 - great
 JFB: congratulations 
 JFB: WildSmilodon - and what is the cost?
 WildSmilodon: You see faces of only 4 people, the ones the most recently spoke
 WildSmilodon: Cost? Don't really know, we have a full Microsoft suit at our University.
 JFB: OK. And only students can use it? For example you can not invite guest for one of your presentations?
 WildSmilodon: Yes, you can have guests. But I am not sure, how are they limited. Didn't try it yet, but there is an option. Students have to use their university login to acces MS teams.
 JFB: OK. Thanks&#160;:-)
 emh: ooo Illedan resubmit
 emh: is it a lot stronger?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: I added mines
 eulerscheZahl: illedan ignoring the growing TODO list of bugs
 Illedan: but forgot to use the information learned from the mines
 Illedan: :D
 emh: ah cool. I don't have mines yet
 Illedan: I have set of a few hours later to fix all that eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't know how the statement works regarding the 4th league&#160;:(
 Illedan:&#160;:/
 Lks10: Can you trigger a mine on the turn you place it?
 Illedan: No
 Illedan: I just try to avoid killing myself :thinking:
 Illedan: I should try*
 Lks10: hitting yourself to confuse the opponent's hp tracking is a great strat, trust me
 Illedan: Not yet
 Illedan: Late Legend, yes
 eulerscheZahl: that can easily be tracked, you know where the opponent shoots
 eulerscheZahl: my tracker should already cover it i think
 yfprojects: If you explode a mine, you give a lot of information to your opponent
 eulerscheZahl: for torpedoes too
 eulerscheZahl: a little less, but still
 blasterpoard: everything you di gives a lot of information to the opponent
 blasterpoard: *do
 JFB: It is lack of one command: gently asking of opponent to kill yourself&#160;;-)
 AntiSquid: what if opponent has same starting position as you Lks10
 Rd211: what type of distance was the firing range of the torpedo?
 eulerscheZahl: 4
 eulerscheZahl: BFS
 Rd211: oh bfs ok thanks
 karliso: "This allows the torpedo's path to contain corners and go around islands, but not through them." I have not seen islands in replays where this matters.
 Lks10: if you inflict the selfdamage with a mine it gets a lot harder to track. Although taking 1 damage to try and mislead your opponent might not be worth it
 Schneewittchen: @karliso what about following situation: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/784dc058-cc8f-468f-a3e6-7bba57ebbf2a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/784dc058-cc8f-468f-a3e6-7bba57ebbf2a</a>
 blasterpoard: Lks10 doesn't the opponent see your hp?
 AntiSquid: oh yeah it's in the input
 AntiSquid: :D
 karliso: Schneewittchen , path lenght is 5 and I don't see such islands as you draw in replays.
 AntiSquid: he is basically saying you could be on opposing sides of the same landstrip
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6d785b24-8e54-468d-88be-ba34f729ca63">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6d785b24-8e54-468d-88be-ba34f729ca63</a>
 yfprojects: What about blocking a hole areaa with mines, so the opponent cant reach you? Has anyone thought of that?
 eulerscheZahl: Schneewittchen they can - by shooting 1 short and hitting with the explosion
 karliso: Ahh, so path lenght in water can be more than 4?
 blasterpoard: no
 Lks10: you could use Silence to dash through minefield
 Schneewittchen: @karliso Then imagine the "2" one step further right :D
 karliso: Schneewittchen you mean left? And even then I don't see such islands - they are all at least 2 x 2.
 yfprojects: @Lks10 That's right but the bot has to think of that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/53d6b352-3a1c-4b92-9637-278de8b10a77">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/53d6b352-3a1c-4b92-9637-278de8b10a77</a>
 dbdr: et voilà, a new leader :D
 eulerscheZahl: happy now?
 AntiSquid: but what if there is an underwater tunnel&#160;? /s
 yfprojects: You might think about adding nuclear missiles @eulerscheZahl
 Schneewittchen: :D 
 yfprojects: They would need a lot of charging but it would be worth it
 karliso: eulerscheZahl , so path lenght in water can be more than 4?
 eulerscheZahl: no, torpedoes can move 4 cells
 eulerscheZahl: but only move in water
 eulerscheZahl: you can get a dist of 5 or 6 with the explosion range
 eulerscheZahl: as you don't have to hit your target directly to damage it
 karliso: I don'g get how your example is relevant - it seems like 1 can't hurt 2 in your example, no?
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: because you were discussion about the island size
 eulerscheZahl: so i made a larger island
 karliso: I think I misunderstood what what was meant by "This allows the torpedo's path to contain corners and go around islands, but not through them."
 karliso: I thought phrasing "go around islands" meant that something like this was allowed:
 karliso: .1.......xxxxxxx.2......
 eulerscheZahl: in this case 1 and 2 can shoot each other
 karliso: Yea, but I was confused as I didn't see such islands.
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 AntiSquid: 2xx.xx..1    
 eulerscheZahl: but here it doesn't even matter if the torpedo stays in the water or takes a shortcut over the island
 AntiSquid: well that's what the wording "going around" implies
 JFB: And it is allowed, is not it?
 Schneewittchen: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: you might have to pay a fine depending on which countries waters you do it on
 MadKnight: youtube and netflix are gonna decrease vid quality for the next 30 days
 Schneewittchen: Generation potato incoming
 AntiSquid: where did you read that MadKnight
 JFB: So probably they switch off 4k. I use projector and it is not important for me do it is 4k or even 1k
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl getting close to bronze?
 MatesCZ1234: Where i can switch to external ide?
 JFB: And I still remember 1st movie on color TV set my father both (it was 2n color TV set in my village). Resolution of any YouTube video is much better that it was this TV set resolution&#160;:-)
 JFB: So in case Netflix will really switch off 4k - I will laugh loudly at anyone who will complain about it
 MSmits: not too loud, or the looters will hear it
 AntiSquid: are the wood bosses gonna be nerfed like during kutulu contest?
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-youtube-exclusive-idUKKBN2170OP">https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-youtube-exclusive-idUKKBN2170OP</a>
 MadKnight: AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: because that was very annoying imo
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr my last submit was closer
 AntiSquid: then more of a reason to not bother with netflix
 AntiSquid: but my wife pays for it, so i can't cancel it 
 eulerscheZahl: the referee sending my failed torpedoes of my opponent is my biggest weakness right now
 eulerscheZahl: as i assume they worked
 MSmits: cant you check their life?
 eulerscheZahl: i do
 MSmits: so what's the problem then?
 eulerscheZahl: opponent shoots torpedo at 3 7 =&gt; opponent is close to that cell
 JFB: So you will tell your grandchildren that there was such a terrible epidemic that youtube was only in 1k resolution. And the children will ask how anyone managed to survive it.
 eulerscheZahl: but that torpedo is fake news
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: why would it be fake news?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a bug in the referee and i won't code around it
 eulerscheZahl: just wait till it gets fixed
 MSmits: oh you can fire a fake torpedo?
 dbdr: is the bug documented?
 dbdr: forum?
 eulerscheZahl: i think no
 Illedan: Someone got a replay with that bug?
 Illedan: And a frame?
 AntiSquid: JFB i would tell my grandkids there's was a Human Locust Epidemic, the shelves where mindlessley emptied even if the products were poor quality
 AntiSquid: were *
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 fix all my spelling mistakes
 Automaton2000: i guess you could use it for a day now
 JFB: Really? For now my biggest problem with shoping was that it was only 3% milk and not my usual 2% milk
 eulerscheZahl: any wrong torpedo target will do to reproduce Illedan
 Illedan: I tried
 Illedan: Didnt see
 Illedan:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: give me a second...
 Illedan: Send it on Discord
 eulerscheZahl: huh, now i can't reproduce it either?
 AntiSquid: but you have the replay in browser history?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: life is cruel
 dbdr: if it's important, it will be reproduced again
 eulerscheZahl: true
 eulerscheZahl: or i was stupid and the bug was on my side
 emh: yay 1st
 eulerscheZahl: i hate it when i watch a replay and then league promotion makes me lost it
 eulerscheZahl: lose*
 eulerscheZahl: congrats emh
 eulerscheZahl: and of course the vikings are leading in a sea battle contest
 emh: thx. hehe
 eulerscheZahl: i'm coming for ya
 emh: oh wow. shortlived pleasure then hehe
 eulerscheZahl: directly from wood
 Tiramon: yay first win against cpt levine
 eulerscheZahl: wait till you see captain Iglo
 Tiramon: btw who is levine, googled yesterday and didn't find any levine with nautic background
 blasterpoard: btw why are the bosses catpains, not captains?
 AntiSquid: is it pirate theme for boss names?
 Tiramon: iglo is not a pirate ..
 Tiramon: but yes its ctp and not cpt
 Tiramon: oops
 AntiSquid: OOPS
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/rk54au">https://prnt.sc/rk54au</a>
 Tiramon: or they meant computer to plate ... but that would still be strange
 eulerscheZahl: from our boss brainstorming
 eulerscheZahl: 30 min before the contest: we need boss names
 AntiSquid: so final boss is captain planet?
 Tiramon: oh family guy .. that explains why i dont know him
 Tiramon: ok looks good for beating levine
 tutubalin: What about Red October?&#160;:)
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 Tiramon: red october is the submarine not the cpt
 dbdr: nice eulerscheZahl
 Tiramon: but yes cpt ramius would be nice
 eulerscheZahl: i got captain Nemo from jules verne on my list
 AntiSquid: is not all cartoon captains?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think we have all names yet
 Tiramon: nemo and ramius are bot nice names for boses
 Tiramon: damn 0.73 behind levine
 Tiramon: still hoping on Dridriun submit to push me up&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i really liked cpt iglo :D
 emh: ahh Illedan took 1st again
 Tiramon: yes iglo i snice for one of the lower leages
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Haddock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Haddock</a>

 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;:(
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeChuck">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeChuck</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that AntiSquid link isn't german
 dbdr: no no, igloo frozen food was in france too
 eulerscheZahl: monkey island, nice
 dbdr: undead pirate
 dbdr: sounds like a gold boss :D
 eulerscheZahl: what about nemo?
 AntiSquid: they sell it here too
 eulerscheZahl: or Ulysses?
 AntiSquid: Captain Haddock from Tintin's adventures
 Tiramon: oh yes haddock nice
 JFB: Not exactly, in poland too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://teoria.fandom.com/pl/wiki/Czy_reklama_Paluszk%C3%B3w_rybnych_Kapitan_Iglo_nawi%C4%85zuje_do_niewolnictwa_/_pedofilii%3F?file=Tytu%C5%82owa_reklama">https://teoria.fandom.com/pl/wiki/Czy_reklama_Paluszk%C3%B3w_rybnych_Kapitan_Iglo_nawi%C4%85zuje_do_niewolnictwa_/_pedofilii%3F?file=Tytu%C5%82owa_reklama</a> 
 JFB: So iglo was in poland too - simply I do not watch TV for years
 eulerscheZahl: to commercial i liked is from 1998
 Morthyr: and in Hungary too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlUSJNMDQeM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlUSJNMDQeM</a>
 Tiramon: ok ok not german only
 MSmits: umm why does it say pedofilii in JFB's link
 eulerscheZahl: because it's a foot lovers website?
 MSmits: or...&#160;?
 JFB:&#160;:-) becouse I found the link in witch they discuss do this commercial connected to slaves and pedofiles&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: witch :D
 tutubalin: "Does the advertisement of Fish Sticks Captain Iglo refer to slavery / pedophilia?"
 MSmits: and fishsticks?
 eulerscheZahl: 4x C# in top5
 AntiSquid: well spotted MSmits
 MSmits: thanks AntiSquid
 blasterpoard: eulerscheZahl that's only because C++ people take their time
 tutubalin: I've just noticed that the second player lives on a yellow submarine.
 eulerscheZahl: i have no doubt about that blasterpoardit's always like that
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: yet you two always end up doing well anyway. Usually top 10, sometimes top 20, right?
 eulerscheZahl: not if i break my bot on purpose :D
 MSmits: dont do that :P
 MSmits: dont tell me you have to do it because you contributed??
 MSmits: that doesnt matter in a month long contest
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm allowed to participate for real
 JFB: exactly
 MSmits: kk
 eulerscheZahl: and i will
 eulerscheZahl: to answer your question above: at Wondev Woman i failed to reach top20 (and even top50) even though i tried. not counting sprints
 MSmits: ah ok, but I wasn't around then, so that doesn't count
 eulerscheZahl: it counts even more then, no smits to stop me
 MSmits:&#160;:) This time it might be different. But I always worry at the start I guess
 MSmits: you've beaten me a few times
 AntiSquid: the passion of the msmits
 AntiSquid: what a movie title
 eulerscheZahl: 50-50 maybe
 MSmits: what is going on in that squid head of yours&#160;? :P
 AntiSquid: you said you got a beating
 AntiSquid: so i remember that movie
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_the_Christ">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_the_Christ</a>
 MSmits: oh, i didn't see it
 AntiSquid: which was a really bad movie
 MSmits: probably won't see it then
 AntiSquid: nothing to see, it's a guy getting beaten up basically 
 phamnuwen: I remember a lot of crying in the audience, not much of the film itself
 MSmits: is this why ricky gervais makes fun of mel gibson's antisemitism at the golden globes?
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: well... we know who Mel blames
 pb4: Hi
 MSmits: he's back!
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 dbdr: hey pb4!
 JFB: Hi
 pb4: I'm back, and being tempted by that Ocean of code contest&#160;:)
 MSmits: as you should be 
 pb4: I was lucky to come read the forum and find the "bugs" topic&#160;:)
 JFB: Great&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: there was a newletter about it
 eulerscheZahl: check your emails
 pb4: I don't get those
 eulerscheZahl: ah, you unsubscribed
 pb4: nope
 MSmits: spam
 AntiSquid: email full
 pb4: Used a temporary email with limited number of forwared emails
 MSmits: it was really hard to get that stuff past the spam filter
 pb4: turns out my account hasn't been that temporary after all :D
 eulerscheZahl: you lost a tshirt link that way MSmits
 MSmits: yes
 pb4: and I didn't bother to increase the email count yet
 AntiSquid: so i guessed correctly! yes!
 eulerscheZahl: i also used my spam address when creating an account here
 dbdr: sorry eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 dbdr: 7 to 12 in 0.12 pts&#160;:)
 tobk: in OoC, can all actions be combined, or are some mutually exclusive?
 tobk: I guess "MOVE N | SILENCE E 1" would not make sense, but can you e.g. TORPEDO and SONAR in the same turn?
 eulerscheZahl: you can combine move and silence tooi'm not sure if it was intended that way
 tobk: interesting. will try and see what happens&#160;:-)
 taschfin: im virgin
 MSmits: the company?
 yfprojects: MSmits thats a type of person. just translate it 
 MSmits: I know :P Anyone have a map with a hole somewhere, like the one Scarfield shared? I could use it to test my floodfill
 AntiSquid: taschfin that's fine, so is AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the main problem?
 AntiSquid: no problem
 MSmits: no need to get touchy AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: add a parameter in the same turn so i can probably come back to the code and i don't know how to emp
 Scarfield: it was SeebOmega that shared it iirc
 MSmits: oh ok
 AntiSquid: what map
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/440938902">https://www.codingame.com/replay/440938902</a>
 AntiSquid: haha
 Scarfield: well he was safe from torps and mines xD
 AntiSquid: seen a few, but i never randomly got placed there
 AntiSquid: there
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll
 MSmits: thanks Scarfield
 Scarfield: np
 tobk: I just got a random play (in IDE) where the opp was trapped in a 1x1 field surrounded by land and border on all sides...
 MSmits: share&#160;:)
 tobk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441064310">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441064310</a>
 MSmits: another one&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: well rekt&#160;?
 dbdr: they are pretty rare I think, and even rarer to pick that spot randomly
 MSmits: yay, flood works!!!
 MSmits: my sub still can't move, but I can floodfill my bitboards :P
 dbdr: this guys has his priorities straight&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits: hmm so I should make a random seed based on the map?
 dbdr: I do a fixed seed based on the map
 MSmits: yes, thats what I mean
 MSmits: so just use the island features somehow
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: coordinatss of land
 AntiSquid: how do you keep track of the opponent's move pattern?
 AntiSquid: i try to expand a 2d vector but not sure this is very efficient
 eulerscheZahl: List&lt;Path&gt;with Path = List&lt;Cell&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: because knowing the final position isn't enough, as the path can't contain the same cell twice
 AntiSquid: i guess a list means less headaches
 Illedan: Hi
 AntiSquid: hi
 MSmits: what you can do for a bitboard is use a uint32_t[30] start in the middle and just apply the moves. then when you need to shift the pattern to match
 MSmits: because the bitboard is 4xlarger, starting in the middle means you can go anywhere
 MSmits: that's what I planned on doing anyway. It's probably not that easy to code
 MSmits: but avoids having to do vectors and loops
 Petras: Coders of the Caribbean 2.0 contest? :ooo
 MSmits: seems very different
 eulerscheZahl: hi Petras
 MSmits: it has water in common
 eulerscheZahl: much more fog of war
 Petras: It's my first time watching the replay :D just seemed similar
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know where the opponent is
 eulerscheZahl: only "opponent just moved north"
 dbdr: heisenberg uncertainty
 eulerscheZahl: or torpedo fired at 3 5
 Petras: interesting, I'm guessing you also don't know the starting pos of the enemy. This contest is going to last for a month, right?
 Hjax: yes on both things
 Petras: Nice
 BenjaminUrquhart: alright I have risen from my slumbers, time to do enemy tracking
 SebastianK: "At the beginning of the game, you'll receive a map (15x15 cells) that indicates the position of islands."
 SebastianK: which const is that?&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: the first loop in teh stub
 SebastianK: got it&#160;;)
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok
 SebastianK: ty
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thumbs_up:
 BenjaminUrquhart: lame
 SebastianK: i know ;P
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thumbsup:
 SebastianK: been a while since i code&#160;:)
 yfprojects: @MSmits what do you do with the silence command?
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr when did you switch to prince of persia 2?
 dbdr: this afternoon. ocean themed
 eulerscheZahl: but only that short sequence
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: then you are on the beach and have to walk on all but 1 tile
 eulerscheZahl: and into the cave
 dbdr: you know your classics&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: but never got far in part 2&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: was hard
 Nixerrr: That PoP2 intro :heart_eyes:
 Nixerrr: I guess I got killed so often immediately that I saw the intro a billion times lol
 Nixerrr: Yeah but I didn't play too much of part 2 either
 eulerscheZahl: part 1 had that guy just standing there and waiting for you to attack
 eulerscheZahl: that part was mean
 Nixerrr: Alright, let's see if I'm able to finish reading the contest statement this time :muscle:
 SebastianK: :joy:
 MSmits: yfprojects i dont do anything yet
 MSmits: first guess would be to floodfill your possible positions 4 times
 MSmits: the opponent possible positions that is
 tonowak: what are the rules of silence for visited cells? I have trouble interpreting "move 0 to 4 cells in a given direction (not visiting already visited cells or islands)". Does it mean that I can move to any of 16 possible cells, if it is on the grid, it isn't and island and it is not visited? What about the cells on the path? Do they have to be valid, non-visited? Do they become visited?
 eulerscheZahl: 17 cells
 eulerscheZahl: the whole path has to be clear
 eulerscheZahl: and all cells on that silent path will become visited
 MSmits: oh, so it is a straight line?
 MSmits: interesting
 MSmits: not floodfilling then
 eulerscheZahl: coding without knowing the full rules again?
 MSmits: no, i did read it, but got confused
 MSmits: the torpedo is floodfilled
 eulerscheZahl: and silent not in your league
 MSmits: well... also, i am not in a league where you can... right
 tonowak: 17 cells? but the cell I'm currently on is already visited, so I can't silence on it?
 MSmits: you can move 0 cells
 Nixerrr: Is Bronze the final ruleset?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it usually is
 MSmits: csb is an exceptio
 Nixerrr: :ok_hand:
 eulerscheZahl: or codebusters
 struct: final rules

 eulerscheZahl: code4life contest
 struct: oh wait
 struct: maybe its not updated if they changed anything
 eulerscheZahl: light IDE?
 struct: no euler
 struct: its from SDK
 yfprojects: Are you able to move diagonally with the silence command?
 Waffle3z: SILENCE W 4|MOVE N 1
 Waffle3z: not MOVE N 1 but like MOVE N SILENCE or something
 Waffle3z: MOVE N SILENCE|SILENCE W 4 also works if silence has a cooldown of 1
 Waffle3z: not like directly only with the silence command though, you have to move 0-4 in one direction
 yfprojects: So there are 17 possible cells you can move to after surfacing. But otherwise there are only 13 possible cells
 eulerscheZahl: why SURFACE now?
 Waffle3z: there are 13 cells you can be in after doing SILENCE
 struct: its more
 Waffle3z: you can also do a MOVE in the same turn to end up in one of 37 positions
 eulerscheZahl: wait, 13 is correct then (not crossing old path)
 yfprojects: only on your first turn or after surfacing
 struct: ah 
 eulerscheZahl: but why do you even bother counting?
 Waffle3z: 13 isn't correct actually since one of them would involve going backwards
 struct: you dont need to move 4  units
 struct: do you?
 Waffle3z: SILENCE N 3 works
 Nixerrr: Yay, I read the statement :smiley_cat:
 yfprojects: @Waffle3z you can also stay on your cell
 Nixerrr: Let's get down to coding boiz
 Nixerrr: No sleep till legend
 Waffle3z: I wonder if SILENCE N -4 works
 Waffle3z: Invalid silence distance
 domak: Hi, I'm on wood2 and when I submit, I can play only 20 matches and then it stops. Does anybody has the same problem?
 eulerscheZahl: does it say 100%?
 domak: no
 eulerscheZahl: looking at the leaderboard, your submit finished
 eulerscheZahl: only showing 18 battles there :confused:
 domak: yes
 domak: I'm resubmitting now
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes the leaderboard is a little laggy when it comes to updating
 domak: I'm going to check the progress
 domak: yes but since this morning it's always the same
 domak: not much than 20 matches

 domak: now it dispaly 50% progress, 30 matches but a lot of matches are not finished yet
 domak: 93% for 40 matches
 domak: but a lot are not finished
 domak: and if I click again in the "last battles" tab, I have only 21 matches
 yfprojects: i got 183 in the same league, but i submitted yesterday. :confused:
 MSmits: lol just won my first match in IDE. The boss blew himself up
 Illedan: :clap:
 MSmits: I was surprised i won because I dont fire torpedos yet
 Waffle3z: I'm surfacing too much, time to bring out my tron code
 MSmits: I already did that. that's where I got the floodfill&#160;:)
 Hjax: i feel slightly disadvantaged having never wrote a tron thingy before 
 Illedan: You can read the post mortems
 kingofnumbers: can someone explain
 kingofnumbers: OCEAN OF CODE
 kingofnumbers: I thought the next contest will start in 7th May
 kingofnumbers: what happened? 
 Yasser:&#160;:/ 
 struct: its a comunity contest
 struct: was only announced yesterday
 struct: the next contest will still happen 
 wlesavo: this is simply a different contest crafted by comunity
 kingofnumbers: aha
 kingofnumbers: thanks for explaining 
 kingofnumbers: but it's really surprising 
 kingofnumbers: I was checking the website every 2-3 days 
 kingofnumbers: and suddenly there's a running contest 
 reCurse: It was sudden like the pandemic
 MindControler: MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO 3 5 What's the difference in these commands?
 kingofnumbers: is there any forum here for official announcements and discussion about current and future contests? 
 MindControler: With the torpedo part?
 reCurse: There was nothing announced prior to the email
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE loads the torpedo
 eulerscheZahl: TORPEDO 3 5 fires it
 kingofnumbers: aha
 MindControler: So it charges the power?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 kingofnumbers: I'm not even following my email messages :D 
 yfprojects: @MSmits are you even signed up?
 MSmits: hjax... tron just uses simple floodfill. The reason I had to steal it from there is because with bitboards, floodfill can be a "bit" more complicated
 MSmits: yfprojects yes, but i havent submitted yet
 MSmits: I'm always slow with contests. Well slow in general, but you normally don't notice&#160;:)
 wlesavo: tron was the next thingy on my list, i guess it ok to do it after
 Hjax: im being pretty slow too 
 Waffle3z: everyone who isn't in 1st place is just being slow
 Hjax: i think i made most of my progress in the last 2 days of UTF 
 Hjax: UTG8
 Hjax: wow typing is hard
 Waffle3z: UTF-8
 MSmits: hmm so you can move and then torpedo
 MSmits: or torpedo and then move
 MSmits: or move, then silence, then torpedo
 MSmits: just in case, you want to be agressive&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: nah, move, torpedo, silence
 eulerscheZahl: hit and run
 Illedan: Hmm, that worked
 eulerscheZahl: what worked? your submit?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: I lose more vs worse players xD
 eulerscheZahl: my mine placing bot is timing out as soon as the opponent uses too much SILENCE
 eulerscheZahl: harder to prune opponent locations
 Ajanx112: I didn't get the move with power part. Does MOVE dir TORPEDO consume 1 torpido to move into a direction that doesn't make sense
 MSmits: it charges torpedo
 struct: it gives 1 charge
 MSmits: dont consume torpedo's it's not advisable
 Scarfield: reduces torpedo cooldown by 1
 Illedan: I see we really need to increase that max rounds :D
 wlesavo: trying to shoot over island gives out of range error, not very convincing
 eulerscheZahl: 600
 Ajanx112: ohh the cooldown... Thx
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong with it wlesavo?
 MSmits: wlesavo you can shoot around corners
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i mean its not out of range it just not incorrect in my undersstanding
 MSmits: it is
 MSmits: the range is 4 cells
 wlesavo:  just incorrect *
 Scarfield: its not manhattan range, its path range
 MSmits: you can shoot around island
 MSmits: so if it gives an error, it is simply more than 4 cells away
 struct: ... here a priest knew he had corona

 eulerscheZahl: you have a 1, i have both of the next 2 digits
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: emh, Mazelcop, field3, LH + othersI'm about to reduce tooltips on the line. Is it enough to only see reduced life?
 Illedan: Or invalid commands.
 emh: hmm?
 Mazelcop: fine for me
 Illedan: The dots on the line are kinda, too many
 Illedan: The viewer line
 emh: ah I see

 eulerscheZahl: I'm about to reduce tooltips on the line. Is it enough to only see reduced life?yes
 struct: When does it go live?
 struct: monday?
 eulerscheZahl: should we nerf the bosses?
 struct: I havent tried but from what I read, yes
 Waffle3z: maybe just add some more wood tiers?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 struct: no
 AntiSquid: wow, found some kitchen roll in the shop, a ray of hope AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: why do you think it will give me a contest in the contest?
 yfprojects: I wouldnt nerf the bosses
 struct: does wood 1 boss fire?
 AntiSquid: oh please don't nerf bosses. it's really annoying
 eulerscheZahl: all bosses use torpedoes
 eulerscheZahl: and track the opponent
 Waffle3z: it's a hard but necessary first step to beat those bosses
 eulerscheZahl: but with a small bronze league, upper leagues will be even smaller
 Illedan: Still 1 week left
 AntiSquid: BUT once someone puts in the effort to beat the bosses it's really annoying they get nerfed, it was stupid back in kutulu contest
 eulerscheZahl: resulting in 5 players in legend, if we keep the usual fractions
 struct: wood leagues are meant to be an introduction
 struct: imo
 AntiSquid: 5 legend players initially is ok imo
 struct: and not require lot of effort to get beaten
 eulerscheZahl: it was justified in kutulu and you get the next higher league
 struct: but this is my opinion
 eulerscheZahl: boss was just moved 1 league higher
 struct: I think you should not get into real coding into you get all rules
 eulerscheZahl: yes, also my opinion (and probably CG too)wood = introduce rules
 Waffle3z: we're still less than a day into the contest, maybe it will grow a bit
 eulerscheZahl: but not block from getting the final rules
 struct: ^
 Waffle3z: wood 2 boss could maybe just never fire if it's too hard
 emh: how do I get proper C# exceptions?
 emh: all of them report on line 0
 Illedan: proper?
 Illedan: You do any fancy stuff to run your code?
 emh: nope
 AntiSquid: like mister proper?
 eulerscheZahl: Unhandled Exception: System.Exception: Exception of type 'System.Exception' was thrown.at Solution+Board.PrintInput on line 393at Solution.Main on line 29

 emh: got lots of lambdas hehe
 AntiSquid: why not give people who want full rules the option to promote?&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: to bronze
 Illedan: Linq ftw?
 Illedan: Damn, you getting close
 AntiSquid: like the -fuck-wood command someone suggested
 eulerscheZahl: you have some strange anonymous types emh?
 eulerscheZahl: doing something fancy for sure
 tonowak: if the opponent uses a sonar, does it show as SONAR 4, or SONAR4? (in the rules it is written SONAR4)
 Illedan: SONAR 4
 Illedan: misses a space
 eulerscheZahl: will be corrected with the next update
 tonowak: ok, ty
 eulerscheZahl: already fixed locally
 struct: is the torpedo thing also fixed?
 eulerscheZahl: couldn't reproduce
 Illedan: I can't reproduce.

 AntiSquid: gonna watch some netflix, check the quality "improvements"
 eulerscheZahl: connection or content quality?
 struct: i think he means image quality
 eulerscheZahl: did he get a new screen?
 struct: I think they reduced it a bit due to coronavirus
 struct: So it doesnt spend so much bandwitch
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 struct: But I think you can still set the quality you want
 struct: not sure
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i have an offline archive
 AntiSquid: found something that debates whether ghosts have feelings like we do . 
 struct: "Netflix and YouTube are reducing streaming quality for 30 days"
 struct: "The company is cutting its bit rate for streams by 25 percent for 30 days."
 Waffle3z: how can youtube do that when I can just turn the quality back up to normal?
 struct: the 25% is for netflix
 struct: not youtube
 Lachrymosa: maybe for all of the embedded streams and things that have disabled settings controls?
 struct: dont know how it is for youtube
 struct: "YouTube has taken a similar approach - for the next 30 days, video content on the platform will only be available in standard definition."
 struct: Dont know how this is ture
 struct: true*
 struct: but ok
 struct: I can still watch in 1080
 Waffle3z: 1080 is the new standard
 struct: even 4k avaialle
 struct: available*
 Waffle3z: 4k is the newer standard
 AntiSquid: idk wtf i am watching lol, this ghost show is really weird, claiming cheese is haunted by ghost
 struct: 8k works
 inoryy: definition stays, bitrate is reduced
 AntiSquid: "Extra Ordinary" - maybe it's an odd comedy
 Waffle3z: so youtube is just throttling itself?
 inoryy: it's not a huge hit to quality but helps a lot with the servers
 struct: it also helps peoples
 ClosetAI: lost to a guy using sonar lmao
 AntiSquid: is this a new firefox functionality or did i install some add-on, i can pop out any videos playing and resize the image to any dimension ... plus it stays on top of other applications

 Hjax: are the actions separated by "|" or by " | "?

 wlesavo: damn, getting some random timeout, even though everything works perfectly fine locally
 wlesavo: while trying to floodfill from points around board edges hm
 tonowak: you could try adding a piece of code that tells you how much time you spent per turn. Maybe the timeout is because of the time limit
 wlesavo: its not even printing message before the function call
 wlesavo: and the message in function
 Scarfield: maybe you floodfill from a land cell, with land all around, and caught in infinity loop?
 wlesavo: and everything works when i comment the function itself
 wlesavo: nop
 wlesavo: checked that
 Itayayay: Ugh I hate how the source code is UI+logic combined
 Itayayay: No offense, its a cool game
 Scarfield: first turn timeout?
 wlesavo: ok, found it, somehow 1 line from input missesin this case

 wlesavo: but one line from input just dont want to come to me

 Uljahn: try something like this file=sys.stderr, flush=True
 wlesavo: with range 14 im getting only 13 lines 
 wlesavo: its even stranger
 Uljahn: also put the first print after the input
 Uljahn: there is some strange interconnection of inputs and debug frames
 wlesavo: ok flush is really helpful
 wlesavo: thx a lot
 wlesavo: i was started to think that im going crazy
 Uljahn: yw
 eulerscheZahl: helps on the toilet too
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i will try that some day
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - when I move and fire torpedo - do torpedo's path is from my position before or after move?
 SebastianK: depends what you do first i guess
 struct: after 
 struct: actions are made in order

 JFB: so move + fire is different that fire + move?

 MSmits: I will try to find the weird stuff then
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN can help

 MSmits: Game Summary:Command not found: TORPEDO 0 0

 JFB: Internal error. Please contact codersHS@codingame.com with a screenshot and a copy of your code. Thanks.
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i got the internal error too
 AntiSquid: can't find the article, there was something about dark matter / empty space being made out of a particle that is made of 6 bosons
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 MSmits: keep looking! I wanna read that
 AntiSquid: i am not sure whether it was on frontiersin.org or another random site
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Timeout shows up on play bar, but doesn't show on game information like games normally do
 JFB: oshea - I have checked - in case of non valid opponent TORPEDO - you will see no TORPEDO command 
 oshea: perfect. thank you JFB!
 ThunderbirdOne: so, this cooldown... 
 ThunderbirdOne: is that equal to required charge?
 Illedan: JFB, did you get internal error multiple times?
 ThunderbirdOne: so, if the cooldown is 0, it's fully charged?
 Uljahn: ye
 ThunderbirdOne: okay
 ThunderbirdOne: kind of weird that the game talks of charges, but then hands you cooldowns... anyway :p
 Uljahn: it's not a cooldown in common sense because it doesn't depend on time
 Astrobytes: But the general concept is the same
 Astrobytes: oof, laggy much
 xmy: is it possible to torpedo move charge torpedo and silence?
 JFB: Illedan  - it is deterministic. 2 my bots only walking and firing

 dbdr: Waffle3z yeah, looks like the upper-mid bronze is pretty flat
 AntiSquid: rednecks with guns are dangerous
 Waffle3z: tried playing against the wood 2 boss and lost. also it placed a mine and then tried to trigger it and failed <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441186879">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441186879</a>
 Waffle3z: it did MINE S|MOVE S TORPEDO|TRIGGER 1 1 and apparently that's not valid
 Illedan: cant trigger on same round
 Waffle3z: the wood 2 boss tried to
 Illedan: That bot is n00b&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: n000000b
 Waffle3z: I wonder where it would place in bronze
 Zenoscave: Very bottom
 fsferrara: Hello! Which one should I learn... Kotlin or Typescript?
 Zenoscave: Yes
 Zenoscave: both are good languages to learn especially if you intend to use them in industry
 AntiSquid: kotlin, not typescript fsferrara
 Waffle3z: pretty sure the wood 1 and wood 2 bosses are exactly the same, silence and mine are just not available in wood 2
 Waffle3z: I'm playing against the wood 2 boss in bronze and it's using silence and mines and it's beating me
 Illedan: All bosses are the same code
 AntiSquid: in the JS world things phase in and out, i think kotlin is more long term than TS
 Zenoscave: That's a very good point Anti
 Zenoscave: also been a while but. PEWPEW
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, I've only seen TS really take off in Angular
 ThunderbirdOne: lots of js devs have gone back to vanilla js
 Itayayay: if I understand correctly a one turn can have move, surface, and torpedo in one turn?
 tonowak: yes, in any order
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: hi I wanna ask about why this doesn't Work
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a:     if light_x &gt; initial_tx:
 Itayayay: cool cheers
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: light_x =31
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: initial_tx=5
 tonowak: maybe it is necessary to flush the output?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, internal error....wow
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a:&#160;?
 Uljahn: TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: do you update Thor's position afterwards?
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: excuseme, my english is not that good, can you explain
 Uljahn: use the hints tab on the left
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: thx
 ThunderbirdOne: btw, for those of you who haven't got it running yet
 ThunderbirdOne: join Folding@Home
 Illedan: PatrickMcGinnisII, wood2?
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: what is it
 ThunderbirdOne: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://foldingathome.org/">https://foldingathome.org/</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes Illedan, I've been getting timeouts on some simple flood fill and path finding algorithms.  Not sure why, could be the php upgrade the happenned since tron battle...I'm revising all my map operations.
 Illedan: The game engine crashes?
 Illedan: Or your code?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, i did get one internal error...but none since
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I got weird timeouts for no apparent reason as well
 Astrobytes: ThunderbirdOne what's that lovely Fatal error at the bottom of the foldingathome page
 ThunderbirdOne: no idea Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i changed code a bit and haven't seen it since
 ThunderbirdOne: all i know is that your processing power helps them fold proteins
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but not my code...very strange
 ThunderbirdOne: and thus cure diseases
 Astrobytes: ThunderbirdOne fills me with confidence
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know about protein folding, I specialised in cell biology :P
 ThunderbirdOne: so you must know about Folding@Home?
 Astrobytes: I do yeah
 ThunderbirdOne: :p
 Astrobytes: Not running it currently though
 Illedan: Ok PatrickMcGinnisII. We have a few rapports about it. And can't reproduce in higher leagues or offline with new fixes on other stuff. Will hopefully be fixed tomorrow
 Astrobytes: Illedan stop French-ing, *reports
 Astrobytes: :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ok, I need opinions:  I've been helping out a son of a friend (the son is 26) and he moved in to my spare room 2 weeks ago.  He got on a train for South Florida yesterday to visit... now should i let him come back?  considering the stupid crisis going on?
 Illedan: huh? :P
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: I'm new ,obviously, can you explain&#160;: what is Folding@House, how can I get better at this
 Illedan: French?
 Astrobytes: rapport
 Astrobytes: "We have a few rapports about it"
 Illedan: haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The wood2 boss got better since yesterday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Not gonna resubmit til i get the next phase of bot running perfect
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Any opinions about the dude coming back from south florida?
 Astrobytes: @PatrickMcGinnisII Depends on possible exposure risk
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he's not careful...and he got on a train and probably will be returning that way
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: Excuse me I know Im kind of disturbing bu I just searched that golding at home a little and, did you realy work on this... I mean It is impossable hard??
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: folding*
 Astrobytes: You could easily get on a train and not catch anything, it's a coin-toss right now PatrickMcGinnisII. If you let him back, he should really isolate for minimum 7 and ideally 14 days
 ThunderbirdOne: I did not work on Folding@Home TheIronBrocolli_2d0a
 ThunderbirdOne: i'm just promoting it, since it's a good cause
 Astrobytes: TheIronBrocolli_2d0a I don't and have not worked on it either
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if that's the case he should isolate where he is and get his dad to drive him back
 TheIronBrocolli_2d0a: just asked
 krokerx: Hello
 Astrobytes: But protein folding is a computationally heavy task
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx for the input Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: To put it mildly
 ThunderbirdOne: absolutely
 Astrobytes: No worries @PatrickMcGinnisII, stay safe man
 ThunderbirdOne: just checking to see if i got this right... I can surface, and then move right?
 krokerx: Hello here. I didn't get if this is a discord channel or not.
 ThunderbirdOne: this is a seperate chat
 ThunderbirdOne: but there is also a discord channel
 krokerx: thanks!
 icecream17: Help.... I still can't get past Wood 2.... should I restart?
 Astrobytes: icecream17 Hey it's your code, do what you feel is right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: All my submitted bot does is do valid moves, charge and toss torpedos at loc y +3 and its 30th in wood2... so i'm thinking you have to monitor enemy sub to pass boss
 Illedan: Correct
 icecream17: hey what is the best way to find what's wrong with your code
 Illedan: Unit test, debug, print messages, take a 5 min break
 GetSchwifty: icecream17 if all else fails, explain it to a rubber duck - in dumb terms
 AntiSquid: if (all)else fails
 Rd211: any way to tell if your program timed out or just outputed something wrong?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what's the best way to pattern match the moves of your enemy without checking all 225 squares?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Rd211 the timeout with show as a colored line on your play bar... it doesn't show in the game information box like most games do
 PatrickMcGinnisII: with=will
 Illedan: Just check all squares, faster than you might think&#160;:)
 xmy: checked all squares
 icecream17: Okay I think my handleOpponent() is not working....
 xmy: with python
 xmy: good enough
 Rd211: you can like store some information beforehand
 Waffle3z: I only check the squares they could have gone to since their last move
 Rd211: yeah ^
 icecream17: i did that too... it's not working so i'm gonna try again
 icecream17: luckily in jaascript the max array length is 4,294,967,295
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Tracking myself instead of enemy for so long
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's interesting how other bots get really good results
 ThunderbirdOne: right so far i'm moving and surfacing when i need
 ThunderbirdOne: now to track the boss...
 AntiSquid: big brother watching himself
 ThunderbirdOne: also need to optimise my movement :p
 ThunderbirdOne: i get stuck way too often
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i made a separate map that rules out any deadend squares on turn 0
 ThunderbirdOne: ah smart
 ThunderbirdOne: that's actually simpler than doing a BFS like thing
 Illedan: deadend squares might save you a SURFACE in the very late game :P
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah
 Waffle3z: they're good spawn points
 Astrobytes: don't have much of a choice in PHP eh Patrick :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there are a few different move handlers
 Waffle3z: not this one though <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/440938902">https://www.codingame.com/replay/440938902</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I got one of those yesterday, pretty funny
 ThunderbirdOne: I currently just pick random locations as spawns lol :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just hope my next submit works out
 ThunderbirdOne: maybe i shoud start shooting random torpedoes :p
 AntiSquid: idk how i managed to timeout in c++ without doing much, added the pragma even . restarted . slowly, but i still think i need the same approach sort off, maybe overdoing some shit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it looks like wood 2 boss loves to start at 0,13 
 icecream17: turns out i only needed to add 1 line of code
 Kurdm: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1161203790976f082197610da87d62c8b5611f1">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1161203790976f082197610da87d62c8b5611f1</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i got my commands order wrong, looks like you can torpedo | move N torpedo, does it allow you to shoot faster?
 Waffle3z: MOVE N TORPEDO|TORPEDO X Y charges first
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like if you torp first you can shoot closer without getting splash dmg considering current position only that is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, this thing gets more complex the longer u look at it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: too much work, gotta get some bbq
 Waffle3z: if you torpedo next to yourself and then move, you shouldn't take damage, but if you move away first then you should be fine if the target is still in range
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i talk to much
 AntiSquid: nah
 Waffle3z: I mean you should take damage
 Waffle3z: if you torpedo next to yourself you should take damage even if you move afterwards in the same turn
 Waffle3z: if you're 5 away from some spot, you can move first and then torpedo in the same turn
 Waffle3z: or if you're 4 away, you can shoot and then silence away so they can't hit back
 AntiSquid: PatrickMcGinnisII <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/SgmIvaoxawQ?t=12">https://youtu.be/SgmIvaoxawQ?t=12</a>
 AntiSquid: also why no avatar PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;?
 AntiSquid: any avatar
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, shoudl be a tree of life
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx Waffle3z
 AntiSquid: the DNA tree of life&#160;? :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gtg, yall sick some shi*  ps
 PatrickMcGinnisII: celtic tree
 AntiSquid: with a celtic tiger stuck on a branch&#160;? :p
 Rd211: is moving as hard to predict and just placing mines a viable strategy? :sweat_smile:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: definitely not a squidy in a tree
 Waffle3z: mines still have to be triggered, so you need to know where they are to trigger the mine
 AntiSquid: Rd211 no shouldn't be, just use a list or a vector to keep track of enemy moves and then compare that to the map, see where it's possible for the movement pattern to actually work
 AntiSquid: basically just a comparison
 Rd211: yea i know i already have that, i was thinking of other strategies more like relying on the time
 Rd211: maybe i will implement a mine strategy and switch between them when i have more life and just run 
 icecream17: Hey wait! You can just add up the totoal opponent moves and then eliminate that way
 AntiSquid: ya .
 Uljahn: sort of a rolling window?
 Illedan: :D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441224243">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441224243</a>
 icecream17: Possible Opponent Spaces at  Start: 197
 icecream17: Possible Opponent Spaces at End: 242
 icecream17: yess....
 Waffle3z: if you always move then you can make mines 33% faster
 Illedan: Should probably do 2 actions at once :thinking:
 xmy: what are 197 and 242?
 Schneewittchen: @Illedan He said and was back on top again.
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Too low lead
 Illedan: Now it's fine. Had a bug&#160;:)
 icecream17: Sigh. "10 2"[0] = '1' not '10'
 xmy: do you guys have a path finding algorithum?
 xmy: i uses random
 xmy: use*
 icecream17: No. I just take the first possible move (that won't get me stuck in 1 width positions)
 Illedan: No path finding
 Waffle3z: I just avoid dead ends and if I come to a choice where I have to choose to enter a disjoint region, I choose the larger one
 Waffle3z: hamiltonian path would be better but harder to compute, also not possible in some cases 
 Waffle3z: that's just for minimizing surfaces, it might be better to avoid or pursue the opponent rather than just maximize space
 Scarfield: i dont think hamiltonian path necessarily would help, might be too easy to track from where you could have come from, and hence where you are&#160;?
 Waffle3z: strategy prediction turns this into rock paper scissors
 barbora: yay, finally out of wood 2
 Illedan: gratz
 inoryy: is this the hardest W2 boss in history of contests or am I missing some obvious strat
 icecream17: i've been on it for 2 days
 Scarfield: you missed the window of oppotunity of 5 minutes, where the boss was bugged :p
 inoryy: lol
 struct: I  agree inoryy
 Scarfield: but yea, the wood bosses are too hard imo as well
 inoryy: did not expect I 'd have to start doing bayesian inference to get out of W2 but I've ran out of the low hanging fruit ideas
 struct: I think wood boss 2 should not shot
 Illedan: Think we will nerf it om Monday :P
 inoryy: but I have work on Monday&#160;:(
 icecream17: me too
 Illedan: Show them CG and they will understand
 inoryy: lol
 Illedan: I'll ask if we can nerf them tomorrow
 icecream17: 1. Do the first move in 1ms
 icecream17: 2. Timeout!
 icecream17: nooo another bug
 icecream17: YAS! I Finally Beat the officer for the first time on move 200 by one life. I can submit....
 Scarfield: time for an icecream :muscle:
 icecream17: 181st! There's a number saying: 25.10
 Scarfield: that is your score, thats what the leaderboard is sorted after
 icecream17: The boss is at 39.30 ....
 Scarfield: yeaa, as ille said, the bosses will be nerfed, if we are lucky, they will already do it tomorrow&#160;:)
 icecream17: Internal error. Please contact codersHS@codingame.com with a screenshot and a copy of your code. Thanks.
 icecream17: What....
 Illedan: Just try again. Should be fixed tomorrow, though we didn't really manage to track the cause&#160;:(
 icecream17: ill email anyway
 Illedan:&#160;:+1: 
 Illedan: Hopefully they can send us the stacktrace
 icecream17: To anyone part of the team, my code is bad. Warned.
 Scarfield: xD
 Illedan: haha
 icecream17: Uh oh.... it's reproducible. Same thing happens when trying again.
 icecream17: Oh what, 3rd times a charm
 icecream17: Hey, I just realized that if the opponent torpedoes we know more about where the opponent is
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 icecream17: What? I torpedoed myself??? I programmed it specifically not to do that....
 Scarfield: Friendly fire&#160;!
 icecream17: No, literally on the same square I was on.
 Scarfield: thats a bad strategy :p
 icecream17: I dont know how other people make such good comments
 Scarfield: its late, and im seriously starting to procrastinate
 RanN42: can someone help me for a sec with weird python error i just started ocean of code and i think math isnt importing...
 Scarfield: i can try, but havent used Python for quite a while though
 RanN42: ok thanks
 xmy: im using python
 xmy: didnt see any error
 RanN42: ye fixed it&#160;:)
 icecream17: [ ] == [ ]      --&gt; false
 icecream17: Can we charge on the turn you fire a torpedo?
 Scarfield: yes, both before (if cooldown is 1) and after shooting
 Scarfield: at least i think so, havent tried to charge after shooting yet
 icecream17: I got "Unknown Exception: No enum constant com.codingame.game.Referee.Directio..." couldn't see the rest.
 Illedan: Means you tried to do MOVE with a wrong direction
 Illedan: What was your output that round?
 icecream17: Oh .... MOVE STORPEDO :expressionless:
 icecream17: Ok try again
 TheZouave: Hey, is there something wrong with the ANEO sponsored puzzle?
 icecream17: Probably not but you can share it here.
 pb4: "Silence requires 6 charge actions to load. This allows you to move 0 to 4 cells in a given"
 pb4: I assume you meant 1 to 4&#160;?
 Illedan: No, 0-4
 pb4: 0 would mean you stay in the same place
 Illedan: Correct
 pb4: ohhh, you can move + silence
 Illedan: You don't need to move
 Illedan: you can doSILENCE N 0as the only action 1 round
 pb4: If you don't move, Silence N 0 means you stay in place
 Illedan: Yeah
 pb4: stay in place = visit a cell you already visited
 pb4: = loss&#160;?
 Illedan: No, it's a valid action
 Illedan: As you don't really visit a cell again if you never move away?
 TheZouave: So on the ANEO puzzle, test 2, it wants 36 km/h but that gets to the light at the 90-100 second duration block.
 pb4: Ok thanks
 TheZouave: At 50 km/h, you get there at the 60-70 second block
 TheZouave: So I don't understand how 36 could possibly be the right answer as the light changes every 10 seconds
 icecream17: idk, need to check....
 icecream17: but lights start green and distance is in m not km
 pb4: Haven't read the referee but I'll shamelessly ask the question since you're here Illedan :D
 TheZouave: You could either get there in the 60-70 second block or the 70-80 second block, because there is only one light
 Illedan: haha, ofc :D
 pb4: if I trigger in a place where I didn't place a mine
 pb4: --&gt; invalid action --&gt; loss&#160;?
 Scarfield: iirc there are some speed limits, but too late for me to check that now sorry
 Illedan: Not losing, but enemy will not get that message
 Illedan: Flagged as invalid command
 pb4: Ok
 Illedan: and if it was your only command, you will automatically Surface
 pb4: So I can treat the list of opponentOrders as a list of valid orders
 Illedan: yes
 Illedan: Would be crazy otherwise :P
 pb4: Yes&#160;:=
 Illedan: And you will not get the MSG they send. As it is not a valid command
 pb4: Just checking&#160;: I can move then mine, or mine then move
 pb4: both are valid, and the result is (obvisouly) different
 Illedan: yes
 Illedan: you can MOVE N MINE;MINE N
 icecream17: km/h to m/s I can't do math... sorry zouave i'm going back to Ocean of code....
 Illedan: To charge the mine power
 Illedan: and use it
 Illedan: if you had 2
 pb4: ok
 TheZouave: okay, do you know who I need to talk to about this issue
 pb4: cooldown in the stub == charge in the referee&#160;?
 Illedan: ye
 TheZouave: because i think the "right" answer is actually wrong
 Scarfield: TheZouave is there a speedlimit that you are not considering?
 TheZouave: speedlimit is 50
 TheZouave: getting answer is 50
 TheZouave: says answer is 36
 Scarfield: you will maybe be inside the traffic stop during its shift to red?
 Scarfield: can remember this puzzle, and on my way to bed
 Scarfield: cant *
 TheZouave: night man
 TheZouave: lights seem to be points
 TheZouave: as does my vehicle
 Scarfield: no idea then, but i guess you should assume there is no issue with the puzzle, its old
 TheZouave: time to break out the paper then
 pb4: Illedan&#160;: how much better do you think bots can be&#160;? compare to your current bot for example
 Illedan: A whole lot better
 Illedan: This is a react bot
 Illedan: no idea about any future 
 pb4: Does it track the opponent&#160;?
 Illedan: yes
 Illedan: and itself
 lNitsua: I'm pretty trash at C and memory management, but I'm trying to practice with this game. my bot keeps crashing with a basic recursive function, and I think it's because of memory stuff
 lNitsua: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/EGuJzRu5">https://pastebin.com/EGuJzRu5</a>
 pb4: wut&#160;?
 pb4: itself&#160;? 
 pb4: oh you mean to know how much information it gave to the opponent
 Illedan: I need to track myself so that I know what the opponent might know 
 icecream17: i thought you meant it's self improving.....
 Illedan: And make it harder for the enemy
 lNitsua: I'm pretty sure the function explorenorth crashes when it calls itself on the third loop
 pb4: yup
 pb4: I won't be easy to implement that cleanly...
 Illedan: indeed
 Illedan: and I think we need multiple algorithms to perform very good :P
 Illedan: *searches
 Illedan: And with 299 rounds on each player form tomorrow the games changes 
 pb4: I'll soon regret not having played Tron :D
 Illedan: haha
 TheZouave: Well as soon as I broke out the paper the problem was obvious
 Illedan: I don't even track the opponent power yet, making me unaware of when he can shoot me..
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441258074">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441258074</a>
 pb4: You didn't know his position when he went over your mines&#160;?
 Illedan: No, he used Silence
 Illedan: I could try
 pb4: yeah, missed that silence
 Illedan: But I found keeping them for later as better. As I can trigger a whole bunch at once. To narrow it down much faster when i'm ready
 Illedan: Can only trigger 1 every round, but faster at least
 pb4: "The map is split in 9 sectors, which contain 25 cells each (5x5 blocks of cells). The top left sector is 1. The bottom right sector is 9."
 pb4: where are the other sectors&#160;? :D

 Illedan: ye

 pb4:&#160;?
 pb4: thanks
 Lachrymosa: SECTOR! god my brain has been calling them nondrants...
 GetSchwifty: i'm always confused on how to measure my turn time
 inoryy: lol spend an hour implementing bayesian inference, and it's immediately useless in the next league
 GetSchwifty: as of what point should i start counting?
 xmy: wait
 xmy: you can use silence after move
 Illedan: Why so inoryy?
 xmy: and you can use only torpedo and no move
 inoryy: silence breaks most of the logic
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 xmy: true
 inoryy: also why give direction for move but not for silence?&#160;:(
 pb4: If I surface in 2 2 (sector 1) then move east (sector 2)
 xmy: im thinking of running a whole game on every turn
 xmy: and eliminate all the outcomes that doesnt fit
 pb4: The sector that will be given to the opponent is sector 1, when I surfaced&#160;?
 xmy: yes
 xmy: to pb4
 pb4: Thanks
 Illedan: 4 2* Sectors are 5 wide
 pb4: :thumbsup:
 inoryy: actually nvm a dumb fix seems to at least partially makes it work again
 icecream17: Okay, when I torpedo, and next move the opponent has lost health (Wood 2), can I conclude that the opponent is within range of the torpedo?
 xmy: no
 xmy: there are following possiblities
 xmy: it surfaced
 xmy: it fired itself
 xmy: its mine exploded itself(not in wood 2)
 xmy: your mine exploded itself(not in wood 2)
 icecream17: ok got it
 pb4: Illedan&#160;: if the opponents doesn't output anything, does the referee provide me with the "SURFACE "commande in the list of actions&#160;?
 Illedan: Yes
 pb4: or do I have to add it myself&#160;?
 Illedan: surface it added yeah
 pb4: thanks
 inoryy: lol promoted like half of top10 :D
 Illedan: Yourself too?
 inoryy: probably yeah
 inoryy: 5pt above boss
 inoryy: with one simple fix (bosses hate it)
 xmy: got frustrated over how much code i now have to tweak
 xmy: quitting
 xmy: bye
 inoryy: difficulty curve is a bit whack because you need opponent position inference to get out of W2 but then W1 is basically a few tweaks on top and off you go
 struct:  inory y what advice would you give if someone wants to stat learning NN?
 inoryy: you mean courses or which ML fields to try or..?
 icecream17: Ugh... codingame.com/replay/441265433
 struct: both if you have suggestioons
 inoryy: fast.ai or deeplearning.ai for courses, for fields I'd probably stay away from DRL at first unless you really want to use it for some specific thing
 struct: thanks I will save links and take a look tomorrow
 struct: Im a bit tired to start today
 struct: but saw you here so had to ask&#160;:)
 inoryy: computer vision is cheaper to start with but with NLP you can get the flashy results like talktotransformer
 inoryy: yeah no problem, always happy to help&#160;:)
 icecream17: Help (javascript)
 icecream17: var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]var beta = arr;beta.push(1)console.log(arr);
 icecream17: When beta changes to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], arr also changes to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. How do I stop this
 Scarfield: i dont know java, but its probably making a pointer to the array for the var beta, so changes in arr will appear in beta and vice versa
 icecream17: java is ...super differnet from javascript. but that's probably true
 struct: var beta = arr.slice();
 icecream17: wow thanks!
 Illedan: I'm off. bye
 Scarfield: yea m2, gn
 struct: gn
 icecream17: submit 2....

 emh: good morning&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: how is ctp. Levine so aware of my position, he shoots right on me within only 3 moves of mine?

 Waffle3z: after you're hit once yeah it knows where you are unless you silence
 Lachrymosa: ah cause he can see proximity of hit by dmg dealt?
 Lachrymosa: 2 vs 1
 Waffle3z: yes
 Waffle3z: and if it is 1, then that eliminates that particular cell because if you were there it would have been 2
 Lachrymosa: so far i have no "find the enemy" stuff, just me pathing about
 Waffle3z: I think you need to fight back to beat it
 Lachrymosa: I do tend to head straight for the enemy though, i just need to implement some findage
 Lachrymosa: yea, clearly charging at it and doing nothing isnt working :p
 Lachrymosa: I think i found out that ctp levine assumes I start at 0,0 until more data is provided
 Hjax: captain levine seems to blow himself up 
 lNitsua: somehow my code started believing in a round earth
 Lachrymosa: fall off the edge like god intended
 Waffle3z: now I'm tracking what my opponent knows about where I am. up to 470 lines of code now
 Waffle3z: and now I need to actually do something with that information
 Lachrymosa: im at 118~ and all i do is move around without crashing lol

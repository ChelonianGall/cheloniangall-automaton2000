 YCSVenom: can i ask a question
 Husoski: You just did...
 Husoski: I don
 YCSVenom: why i didn't have any cp for "Don't Panic" Coding golf?
 Husoski: I don't think there's a "game mode" in CoC
 YCSVenom: there is "Game Modes" in CoC 
 YCSVenom: FastestShortestReverse
 Husoski: Oh, okay.  I was thinking of the game mode puzzles that have a GUI and a game loop.
 jacek: you cant choose CoC mode, its random
 YCSVenom: you can but in private clashes
 Husoski: You can with private clashes.
 Husoski: Looks like questions are covered.  I'm going back to chess board analyzing...

 Andret0701: hello
 jacek: good evening
 Andret0701: im kinda new to clash of code and im wondering if anyone knows what this syntax does in this context: "d,*g=open(0)"
 Andret0701: it's python. I think it replaces input(), but i am not sure how
 jacek: is it really python
 Andret0701: python 3?
 jacek: oh
 jacek: but quick google indicates its stdin
 jacek: so something like input()
 UnicornFlake: H
 UnicornFlake: GKJHGFDSDFGHJKIOIU765REDSX BNJKLOIUYTFDXCVBNJKOIUYTFFBJKOPOIUYTFVBN?LMP¨POIUYGTFVBNJIUYTRFGHUYTRFGHJIUYTFVHJUYTRFDJKUYTFVBNJIUYTRDHJKOIUYTRDCVBN?KLKIUYGFCDSAQQQQQQQSDFGHJKOPOIJHBV
 jacek: ...
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: open() open a file. open(0) open stdin. So you get all the inputs in strings. one by line. The first one goes in d, the second in g.
 jacek: and i stupid wasted so many characters on input()&#160;:(
 Andret0701: thanks blaise
 Andret0701: i dont think i completely understand tho
 Andret0701: lets say the first input() returns "hello" and the second returns "world", what will "d,*g=open(0)" return if i call that instead
 Andret0701: what will d be and what will *g be (and what's up with the star before the g?)&#160;:)
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: d="hello" and g=["world"]
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: The star make g being a list
 Andret0701: oh i see
 Andret0701: so if i write *d=open(0) i will get ["hello", "world"]?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Nope.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: You have a list of var at left, and a list of value at right. The * before the last var stands for "all the remaining values"
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: But, you can't use it alone. Two var is the minimum.
 Andret0701: can you give me an example
 Andret0701: can i do one variable and get all the values?
 Uljahn: it's called packing/unpacking in python, you can search for examples yourself
 Andret0701: thanks:)
 Westicles: all the weirdos have 8 hours to furiously level up to approve my DAWG
 Jay10890: Anyone have the code for mars lander episode 1
 Westicles: let's barter
 jacek: oO
 struct: i trade mars landers ep 1 code for NN framework
 ja_fica: darkhorse is carrying me in C4 so much
 jacek: ja_fica does thompson sampling / beta distribution requires wins/loses as integers?
 ja_fica: They are used as power
 jacek: for normal mcts there are successes and failures. can we make it work with NN's [-1,1]
 ja_fica: you have to convert to win lose
 ja_fica: it can be a real number in theory
 ja_fica: for example, score: -30 visits: 90 will be converted to 30 wins 60 loses
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: ok thankies
 struct: how do you handle draws?
 ja_fica: you can also use an exploration factor for example 0.5
 ja_fica: then that case would be 15, 30
 ja_fica: the lower the visits the higher the exploration
 ja_fica: draws are tricky, I will add 0.5 to each win/lose
 ja_fica: with the regular transformation they would be accounted for
 ja_fica: for example socre 0 and visits 30: results in 15 wins, 15 loses
 ja_fica: But like I said, it is much much slower than UCT because you cannot precompute most of the equation
 jacek: alright. i think i have workable sim for 9mm
 ja_fica: 9mm?
 jacek: i stopped caring about mcts speed after using NN
 struct: nine mens morris
 quasi_ubique: Anyone know why my test cases aren't going through? (In javascript) It seems to be printing to console fine, but it says Found: Nothing. I'm printing a space seperated string to console, line by line.
 struct: maybe a trailing space at the end?
 ja_fica: Is there any website for VHDL competitions?
 jacek: btc miners :v
 ja_fica: Artificial Inteligence VHDL, I mean
 Westicles: struct, don't give it away, we're on the barter system now
 ja_fica: I want to start studying some progress to create AGI, and I think the best way is to play with digital systems, although analog systems  are much more promising

 ja_fica: how do you copy code?
 quasi_ubique: Ah ok thank you
 struct: what do you mean ja_fica?
 ja_fica: that link, how do you generate it?
 struct: if the message has 5 line breaks or its long enough
 struct: it will auto generate it
 struct: doesnt work on private messages though
 Westicles: AGI?
 Westicles: oh, general intelligence.  well, there is one really easy way
 Jay10890: can you program the rocket to free roam or go left and right in mars lander
 struct: you can make it go left and right yes
 struct: check the other episodes 
 Jay10890: do you have solution for it
 struct: maybe
 Jay10890: checl
 Jay10890: check
 struct: which episode?
 Jay10890: any episode that has the left and right mec
 Westicles: not sure what the going rate is for that
 Jay10890: so you dont know solution 
 struct: ik
 Jay10890: so you know solution
 struct: yes
 Jay10890: what episode
 struct: all
 Jay10890: what is solution
 struct: which language do you want?
 Jay10890: any
 struct: what do you need this for?
 Jay10890: what you mean
 struct: what do you need the solution for
 Westicles: he is using the socratic method to help you learn not to cheat
 Jay10890: mars lander the one that can make it go left and right
 Uljahn: why don't you want to solve it yourself? that's a good practice
 struct: I did not know that was a thing Westicles
 Scarfield: if you cant solve it, choose another puzzle, there is no learning in being handed the solution. ask for tips to get actual help Jay10890, you wont be given the solution by anyone i know here anyway
 Jay10890: no i wont go another puzzle
 Scarfield: is this some school assignment or something?
 Jay10890: yes
 Jay10890: i need the solution for mars lander it has to go left and right
 Scarfield: okay, do you know some trigonometry?
 jacek: i never sin
 Scarfield: lets sin together, cosin
 asioud: does anyone know how to be in the leaderboard for a game?
 asioud: like how can i see my rank
 Scarfield: you have to submit your code by clicking "test in arena" and wait for the submit process to finish
 asioud: 2 sec my thing is in french'
 asioud: you mean play all testcases^
 asioud:&#160;?
 jacek: yellow text button
 Scarfield: its a puzzle? there is no leaderboard unless its optimization
 asioud: its mars lander - episode 2
 Scarfield: or multiplayer 
 asioud: submit?
 Scarfield: mars lander episode 2 doesnt have a leaderboard
 jacek: no leaderboard for puzzles
 struct: only this mars landers has a leaderboard

 asioud: ive seen it before it does
 asioud: a leaderboard for most fuel at the end of the 5 tests
 struct: check what I linked
 Jay10890: struct
 asioud: ok thats what i was looking for thank you
 struct: yes
 asioud: only thing is i cant find myself in the leaderboard
 asioud: oh its top 1000 nvm
 struct: did you made a submission?
 struct: ah ok
 asioud: yea i submitted it
 Jay10890: soluiton
 Jay10890: struct
 Scarfield: as said you wont be given a solution, im heading off soon, but will give some tips
 jacek: tipfield
 Scarfield: you know the acceleration from gravitiy 3.711 i think.. you know the acceleration from the pods thrust. if thrust upwards is bigger than gravity downwards you go up.. say your pod has thrust 4, there will be an angle that counteracts the gravitiy of 3.711, but goes either left or right
 Westicles: the guy is 12yo, he doesn't know about gravity
 Scarfield: i would argue a 12yo would have experienced gravity :p
 Scarfield: but seriously Jay10890 im ready to help, you wont be handed a solution, but tips to get you in the right direction
 jacek: or left
 Scarfield: xD sigh
 Jay10890: struct
 struct: i dont share full code with people I dont know
 struct: you probably could have solved the problem by now
 Jay10890: noep
 Jay10890: nope
 jacek: you could go to mars by now
 Scarfield: he pm'ed me to give him solution, so much for trying to offer help
 Scarfield: gn folks

 Yasho25: print("Hello World")
 Automaton2000: but you are welcome&#160;:)
 Marchete: new ideas, jrke?
 jrke: jo not new ideas just trying to fix bugs
 jrke: no*
 MadKnight: hey Marchete
 dbdr: jrke: fixing bugs is a good idea&#160;:)
 dbdr: MadKnight, are you working on a bot now?
 jrke: but 0 bugs fixed till now or maybe some new i introduced
 dbdr: cannot you reproduce those endgame mistakes that MSmits mentioned?
 jrke: endgame bugs are too diffucult to fix in my current bot
 dbdr: why?
 jrke: code became messy
 dbdr: time to refactor
 jrke: yeah
 jrke: dbdr:do you made any other change or resubmit
 dbdr: changed
 jrke: k
 dbdr: do you resubmit just to see if you get lucky?&#160;;)
 jrke: no im changing small things and checking will it work or not
 dbdr: probably you would get more benefits from fixing the endgame bugs
 jrke: yeah the major bug or you can say weakness of my bot
 jrke: did you went heuristic in endgame?
 Vasyakin: 5051
 dbdr: yes
 jrke: means turns &gt; 56 for game and 23&gt; for a single player right?
 dbdr: not precisely, but that's roughly when endgames starts, yes
 jrke: ok
 Sevi1: hello
 dbdr: hi
 jrke: hey
 jrke: dbdr nice submission
 dbdr: thank
 dbdr: s
 Sevi1: what you doing on this page
 dbdr: nobody knows
 Ethan.B: hello?
 Marc19: hey
 AntiSquid: hi
 AntiSquid: it's a hello world page, now make your own Sevi1
 Marchete: dbdr_: 8-41 against jrke?
 dbdr: it happened
 dbdr: thanks for being here Marcheteso we don't need to be last at 0%&#160;;)
 dbdr: played: 34lost: 0played against #1: 0
 dbdr: .
 Marchete: :S
 Marchete: good bless debuggers
 dbdr: and those writing them?
 Marchete: D&amp;B seems a top3 game right now
 dbdr: and top 3 make some stupid mistakes
 dbdr: it's unusual
 m0rsmordre: hello there
 Marchete: maybe people tend to go with simple heuristics
 Illedan: My bot is dead stupid, no idea why you are not getting 100&#160;% wins vs it :P
 darkhorse64: No double dealing, chain/loop stuff&#160;?
 Illedan: Double dealing?
 Marchete: there is a simple way to know if a line create two separated chains?
 Marchete: lol Illedan_ :D
 darkhorse64: OK, really dead stupid bot
 Marchete: so: D&amp;B seems a top2 game right now
 Marchete: no offense :D
 Illedan: I know
 Illedan: But I don't get how they don't crush my bot
 darkhorse64: double dealing is a trick to keep control when farming boxes in the endgame
 Illedan: To split a 4 chain into 2 doubles?
 Marchete: it's about control
 Marchete: give boxes for a greater gain
 Marchete: "sacrifice"
 Illedan: Yeah, I do those things. But I never check if it is worth it :P 
 Marchete: then you are using it
 Marchete: maybe you call it "Illedeal", but it's probably de double dealing
 Marchete: the*
 darkhorse64: When you farm boxes, you sacrifice the last two boxes in the chain to force your opponent to open a new chain and leave the hand to you
 Illedan: Yeah, that is easy to do with a simple IF
 darkhorse64: Actually, when there is no single box with three borders left, you are in the endgame and there are algos to ply optimally. The real deal is building chains so that you win in the end. Othersise said, it happens between move 1 to 56, after it's strictly determinisitic
 darkhorse64: *Otherwise*
 Illedan: Yeah, I was expecting the top to create those chains already :P 
 Marchete: :unamused:
 Marchete: you are the -3vel of D&amp;B Illedan
 Illedan: Most advanced stuff I have is a floodfill :P 
 Marchete: wow!
 darkhorse64: Have you heard about string and coins&#160;? It's the dual game compared to B&amp;D and it provides a data representation that allows esay chain computation
 darkhorse64: No floodfill needed
 darkhorse64: Unless you need for other purposes
 darkhorse64: *need it*
 Illedan: I just save the chucks and the number of edges, using it to determine my logic :P
 Illedan: Didn't even try to model this stuff correctly
 Illedan: Still using both edges provided for 1 edge :D 
 darkhorse64: No search&#160;? Just reasoning on topology&#160;?
 darkhorse64: I mean no deep search
 darkhorse64: No MCTS or Minimax have been harmed during this multi
 JBM: you like that phrasing
 darkhorse64: a chat meme&#160;?
 JBM: like we need more
 darkhorse64: OK. Twice the same day is too much but I used two different chats
 Marchete: depth = 0 bot :D
 darkhorse64: TrueAI bot
 MSmits: I gathered some statistics of the nature of simple loony endgames in 7x7 D&amp;B
 MSmits: Turns out that by the definition of simple used by those papers with heuristics that are written for 5 x 5, about 0,3% of endgames are simple
 MSmits: meaning that if I generate 1 million endgames, I get 3k simple ones :P
 dbdr: randomly?
 MSmits: yes
 jrke: so what you discovered from that Ms?
 MSmits: that the heuristics as formulated are useless unless expanded. That will be my project :P
 MSmits: also there is one heuristic that says if the controlled value is &gt;= 2, you can just take it as the real value
 jrke: how many possible outcomes could be?
 MSmits: out of all the simple games, that is almost always true
 MSmits: so the more complex heuristics are useful in about 0,02% of cases
 jrke: so you will go with heuristic approach?
 MSmits: sry, 0,002%
 jrke: with expansion
 MSmits: I will try it, it's a fun exercise. Not lookign good though&#160;:)
 MSmits: bte
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1894abf5-98c9-473b-af72-d3062e9bb88e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1894abf5-98c9-473b-af72-d3062e9bb88e</a>
 MSmits: thats one of those super rare simple loony end games where complicated heuristics are useful
 MSmits: controlled value is negative, so you got some control switching back and forth
 MSmits: people will actually take the boxes in the loops, instead of giving them away
 jrke: yeah i think i will lupdate my bot to turn heuristic at endgame
 MSmits: yeah, but that's not easy at all and as i said, almost never useful unless you expand on the current research knowledge base of D&amp;B
 MSmits: so if you succeed, you could publish a paper on it
 MSmits: it's hard for me to even test if i implemented the heuristics correctly, because I have to look so hard for a suitable game
 MSmits: I'm going to try and code a minimax to solve the end games that way and see if it lines up with the heuristic result
 MSmits: then I can cook up some new heuristics, run a million games and see if they still agree
 MSmits: fun fun
 jrke: million games offline?
 darkhorse64: If there are still 3+ connections, it's not yet an endgame but you have to search until the board comes to that point (or find an heuristic for these) right&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, what i actually mean is, try 1 million seeds (takes a few seconds) and only take the games handled by the heuristics and minimax those
 MSmits: darkhorse64 that's not true, a 3+ connection thing can be an endgame
 MSmits: it's just not a simple endgame
 MSmits: because you can't place a line on any of the 3 places that are empty due to neighbors
 MSmits: (that already have 2 lines)
 MSmits: even a 4 way split is possible in an endgame
 MSmits: I found 2 end games with 12 splits in a single floodfilled structure, out of 1 million games
 MSmits: so that's lots of crossroads
 MSmits: lemme find one and share it
 darkhorse64: OK. You are in the endgame if any move results in giving away a box
 darkhorse64: something called a grid lock state
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/58fd10f9-6c63-4017-9f5d-43e2068077c2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/58fd10f9-6c63-4017-9f5d-43e2068077c2</a>
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: look at my example
 MSmits: everything is connected
 MSmits: still an endgame
 MSmits: very non-simple
 dbdr: single chain&#160;:)
 MSmits: not this one, but sure, single chain is possible
 MSmits: single chain is actually a simple end game
 dbdr: right, chain is not the right word
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/484083437">https://www.codingame.com/replay/484083437</a>
 MSmits: yeah jrke, my heuristics work for that one&#160;:)
 MSmits: but it's trivial
 dbdr: MSmits, what year can we expect your bot?&#160;;)
 MSmits: 2020 hopefully :P
 MSmits: honestly not sure
 MSmits: 2 things can happen. Either I keep trying to do this heuristic thing and finally succeed. Or I give up and just make some basic search bot and give up.
 MSmits: thats giving up twice :P
 MSmits: I like a challenge though, we'll see
 reCurse: Giving up is writing an opening book
 MSmits: can't write an opening book without a good bot
 MSmits: or anyway, not one that wins
 dbdr: also I think OB is useless here
 MSmits: depends on how others do their bot. if they dont use appropriate randomness, then it might not be
 MSmits: but should be easy to do 
 dbdr: useless against decent bots&#160;;)
 MSmits: should be yeah
 dbdr: initially, I meant rather useless for the general case
 dbdr: as opposed to beating a few specific bots
 MSmits: ah yeah, it sure is useless for that
 MSmits: not in ever game btw. 
 dbdr: definitely
 MSmits: btw, I do have two expansions on the basic heuristics that might work. If you want to discuss them, I am not 100% sure
 dbdr: there must be a typology of games
 dbdr: or we must create one
 MSmits: sure
 dbdr: does branching go up, down, or up-then-down, for instance
 MSmits: that exists
 MSmits: is called diverging or converging
 dbdr: that has a name?
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: ah nice
 MSmits: read that ina  paper on solving games
 MSmits: othelo diverges, then converges
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: D&amp;B converges
 MSmits: so, I was thinking, you always open 1 chains first, then 2 right?
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: so isn't that also the case when  the 1's and 2's are connected to a split?
 dbdr: what's "that"?
 MSmits: that you would take them first
 MSmits: so if they arent isolated
 MSmits: but connected to a 3-way or 4 way
 dbdr: I haven't proved it's optimal
 dbdr: just seemed logical
 MSmits: me neither, but I did some examples and it did seem logical
 MSmits: another one is
 MSmits: say a split has only chains attached to it
 MSmits: , for example 3 chain, 4 chain, 5 chain and 6 chain
 MSmits: all connected by 4 way split
 MSmits: would it ever be worse to open the smallest first?
 MSmits: since the rule for simple games is to always open the smaller chains before the larger ones
 dbdr: I always do smallest first
 MSmits: ah yes and thats certainly optimal for simple games
 MSmits: I am just wondering if it's true for games with splits also
 dbdr: but if you open, you have lost control, and it's not often that you can win
 MSmits: true, but there might be a bunch of loops you took earlier
 MSmits: loops are beneficial for the defender (non-controller)
 dbdr: yeah, and 2s
 dbdr: well, 2s you switch
 Stilgart: MSmits, dbdr: do you use a hardcode solution for CvZ&#160;?
 MSmits: sure, but 2's go back and forth so it only helps for an odd amount
 MSmits: the penalty for short chains is at most 1 or 2
 dbdr: Stilgart: offline, yes
 dbdr: why?
 MSmits: i do too, I even used unity for this one
 Stilgart: i am trying to figure out what is the best non-harcoded score in the leaderboard
 Stilgart: 700k sounds reachable without hardcoding
 MSmits: Robo's non-hardcoded
 MSmits: rank 24 with 463k
 MSmits: my fallback solver has like 200-300k points only. It's a basic MC
 dbdr: it's a thin line between offline and online spamsubmit
 MSmits: I think the difference between nr 1 and lower ranked players might just be 1 validator
 dbdr: theorem: as the number of submits tends to infinity, it is undistinguishable from offline search
 MSmits: infinity yeah
 MSmits: but the calculation time is used less efficiently
 reCurse: Theorem: infinity does not exist
 darkhorse64: You have to love cars, stairs, traffic lights and busses 
 dbdr: "tends to", not sure if that's the right word
 MSmits: the difference between doing a meta mcts or just using the same calculation time for MC
 MSmits: when you just do MC, you lose all information gained from previous iterations
 MSmits: nothing is stored
 dbdr: reCurse: of course infinity exists&#160;:)
 MSmits: I dont even understand what "exists" means in this case
 darkhorse64: AG, HC should be better in this respect
 dbdr: has a precise meaning
 MSmits: whats AG and HC?
 MSmits: also what do you mean by precise dbdr? That exists means it has a precise meaning or that infinity has precise meaning
 darkhorse64: AG-&gt;GA= Genetic algorithm, Hill Climbing
 MSmits: ohh ok
 darkhorse64: AG is french
 MSmits: I see
 dbdr: I was trying to come up with a definition of "exists". not saying it's the ultimate one
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: also it's your definition
 reCurse: So dragons exist? I have a precise meaning for it
 MSmits: we need to all share the same definition to use it in a conversation effectively&#160;:)
 Stilgart: yeap, dragons exist
 dbdr: there has been debates whether 0 exists, or negative numbers, or complex ones, ...
 dbdr: at least in math
 dbdr: if you can give a precise definition of dragons in math language, then yes they exist in math&#160;:)
 MSmits: physics is the subset of math that exists
 dbdr: troll :D
 MSmits: maybe&#160;:)
 dbdr: "what exists is what I understand"&#160;;)
 MSmits: solipsism?
 reCurse: He's kinda right though
 darkhorse64: phisics is to math what military music is to music
 Stilgart: dbdr: it's a cylinder with spikes that spits fire
 dbdr: isn't that ""what exists is I only"&#160;?&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah 
 dbdr: darkhorse64 I heard that about military justice
 darkhorse64: It's valid too
 darkhorse64: Or you can say the same for Strauss and Mozart
 dbdr: the mandelbrot fractal exists, but you cannot make a physical object of it
 MSmits: the idea of it exists in your mind, but part of the idea is the infinity part. 
 dbdr: you can define it and calculate properties, you can visialize any part of it on a computer, ...
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Exist in your mind is contradictory
 dbdr: that's exactly the definition of "towards infinity": it's not that you can see it all at once
 dbdr: it's that there is no end
 MSmits: reCurse that hinges on the definition of "exists" again 
 dbdr: and you can always see further
 reCurse: If that's the definition then everything exists
 reCurse: Not very useful
 MSmits: noone said it had to be useful
 MSmits: well you just did I suppose
 dbdr: there are very few things that can be defined precisely
 dbdr: so it's a very useful concept
 dbdr: infinite but few. like natural numbers compared to real ones
 reCurse: So everything exists
 MSmits: I had a discussion about that with a professor when I was in high school
 MSmits: got a little heated
 MSmits: I said there were more real numbers than natural ones and he claimed they were both infinite so the amount is equal
 dbdr: define "everything"&#160;;)
 dbdr: you were right MSmits
 dbdr: I thought you were the one who didn't get this
 LinhT.Nguyen: indeed
 MSmits: no I get it, it just didnt make sense to me that all infinities are the same
 dbdr: and there is a precise definition of "more"
 SydM107: all infinities are not the same...
 dbdr: they are not the same
 MSmits: right
 dbdr: reCurse derailed the chat with his obscurantism&#160;;)
 MSmits: allright gonna try to do some coding on this minimax, been a while since i coded one
 dbdr: ok, report back in 10 minutes
 MSmits: 10 hrs probably :P
 dbdr: for minimax?&#160;;)
 MSmits: nah it's mostly the move generation
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: instead of playing lines i need to pick  chains and loops to play
 dbdr: or lines
 MSmits: not in endgames
 MSmits: simple ones anyway
 dbdr: ah, only for endgame
 dbdr: right
 reCurse: Obscurantism pfft
 MSmits: i need the minimax to check if my heuristics are correct
 dbdr: "infinity does not exist" is basically rejecting science
 reCurse: lol ok...
 MSmits: what if you're saying the earth is flat and infinite&#160;?
 reCurse: Nice troll
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 JBM: and of homogeneous resistivity
 MSmits: damn now i have two things to google
 <b>**MSmits googles obscurantism and homogeneous resistivity</b></p><p><img src="/a/43448306132121" /> dbdr: the earth is fractal, it has finite volume and infinite surface
 JBM: got it wrong, it was "uniform density" <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/669/">https://xkcd.com/669/</a> sorry MSmits
 MSmits: still doesnt make sense :P
 MSmits: infinite flat earth violates gravity pretty much though
 JBM: you don't say
 JBM: just make gravity a constant uniform field, duh
 MSmits: oh, right
 JBM: it's how *my* physics teachers did it
 MSmits: that's actually an easy solution
 JBM: then again you might have your own tricks
 MSmits: no no, that's what we do 
 JBM: see
 dbdr: do we even know what causes gravity?
 JBM: your mom
 reCurse: lol
 JBM: there, done.
 MSmits: perfect burn
 dbdr: :clap:
 MSmits: if you're asking why stuff is attracted to other stuff it's answerable
 MSmits: it's the curvature of spacetime
 MSmits: if you want to know why mass curves spacetime, we dont know
 SydM107: more of a how than a why
 MSmits: yeah, the how is hard enough 
 MSmits: without worrying about the why
 dbdr: yeah, why question ftw&#160;:)
 Marchete: nice output
 MSmits: there's much simpler questions physicists can't answer
 MSmits: like, what is electrical charge?
 MSmits: we know perfectly what it does, but not what it *is*
 MSmits: true for any elementary property I suppose
 Marchete: I think any N chains of degrees &lt; 3 are solvable with theorems
 Marchete: but not checked
 MSmits: &lt; 3 or &lt;= 3?
 Marchete: &lt; 3 like your example
 MSmits: yeah they are for sure in simple end games
 MSmits: thats what the papers say
 Marchete: ok then :D
 MSmits: but what if they're connected to a  split
 MSmits: 3-way or 4-way
 Marchete: then it's not a endgame for me :D
 MSmits: your definition of an endgame is different from what the papers say then
 MSmits: arbitrary endgames are games where you cant place a line without giving away a  box

 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: you know it?
 dbdr: "these infinities are real" is also dedicated to reCurse&#160;:)
 Marchete: not an endgame at all
 reCurse: My point didn't make it through so forget it
 reCurse: Easier to just say I'm a troll or "obscurantism"
 reCurse: w/e
 MSmits: Marchete you cant play a line anywhere though
 Marchete: there is a special case of a loop joined to a ground chain
 Marchete: but with a T
 MSmits: without giving away a box
 Marchete: I can't say a lot
 MSmits: with your definition, you might have to wait till the last few lines till it becomes an endgame
 MSmits: there's no reason those exceptions will be opened first
 dbdr: reCurse: I spoke about "approaching infinity", which is the basis of calculus. saying "infinity does not exist" misses the point
 dbdr: it's not "reaches infinity"
 jrke: the thing you imagined is not infinity
 MSmits: dbdr i understood about 30% of that song :P
 MSmits: enough for it to be fun
 dbdr: me probably 5 or 10%&#160;:)
 dbdr: but still fun, I can see what it's doing
 MSmits: whats cool is that the guy shared his masters thesis in the description
 MSmits: so he's not just singin it
 dbdr: yeah, you need to know a lot just to write the lyrics
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: it's really nicely edited too
 MSmits: could be a professional music video easily
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6rVHr6OwjI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6rVHr6OwjI</a>this one is good too
 JBM: it's one of his earliest
 JBM: they got much better
 JBM: i love the hamilton one
 dbdr: he had to learn to speak that one backwards. definitely huge work
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: he sang it backwards
 MSmits: I think
 dbdr: well, pretended at least, for the lips
 dbdr: I'm sure the sound track is still recorded forward
 MSmits: i'm not sure, some guy in the description says there's a making-of video where he sings it backwards
 dbdr: for the lips
 MSmits: but i cant imagine singing backwards
 jrke: i just made my 200th submission in D&amp;B
 jrke: gn
 MSmits: nice jrke&#160;:)
 dbdr: really? 200
 MSmits: I have 4 submissions of which 2 failed in wood 2 :P
 MSmits: cuz the bot was too good
 dbdr: classic
 dbdr: I have 40
 MSmits: he sang it backwards

 JBM: i love him
 dbdr: right, but if you reverse this track does it give the final one?
 JBM: he's one of the very rare youtubers i've actually sent money to
 dbdr: also, the final track has many voices at once
 MSmits: no idea dbdr, maybe he explains it in the video, still watching
 EveryOS: On the home tab, how did i get the collaboration badge under "Unlocked Certifications"
 EveryOS:&#160;?
 MSmits: maybe they thought you were EricSMSO, that's what keeps happening to me

 MSmits: i dont actually think thats why you got the badge, but i do get confused a lot
 IcedCrescent: does anyone have "Activating C# language assist" when choosing C# in the editor? It seems that intellisense never works
 MSmits: I don't code much in the IDE, but when I do, the assist annoys me (using c++)
 MSmits: sometimes the error reporting helps a bit
 MSmits: I suggest you code locally for anything bigger than a puzzle
 MSmits: especially in C# when you can run VS
 IcedCrescent: Yeah, I retorted to using RoslynPad to write snippets (It's like LinqPad but free)
 DoxLee: Hi
 reCurse: I tried it a bit and it worked very well with C++ actually
 reCurse: Light years ahead of the old editor anyway
 MSmits: I guess I am just annoyed that it slows things down when you're not using it
 MSmits: loading the IDE with it takes more time
 jacek: reCurse light years are units of distance, not time
 jacek: common mistake
 jacek: :v
 MSmits: I'd say you're trolling, but I am blown away by the correctness of your physics
 jacek: so, no trolling?
 JBM: how far away?
 reCurse: I was talking about a distance
 reCurse: Should go without saying

 JBM: jacek: i'll tell the devs about it
 reCurse: Webchat is mostly filled with trolls anyway
 JBM: or
 JBM: webchat is mostly filled with trolls *when you're there*
 JBM: hard to tell
 reCurse: Case in point
 MSmits: wait... are you saying you're a troll when you're here, but not on discord?  :confused: 
 JBM: that's my reading
 reCurse: No I'm saying this is another prime example of trolling
 reCurse: Or pointless discussion
 MSmits: there's more points on discord?
 JBM: after the infinities' inexistence, that's rich XD
 reCurse: Alright you guys win
 reCurse: Bye
 MSmits: I blame this on you JBM
 JBM: there's probably some gamification thingy i'm missing on discord
 JBM: MSmits: hey discord doesn't want me ok
 MSmits: possibly
 JBM: by a very personal choice of him, dare i add ^^'
 MSmits: honestly though, I don't mind light banter with no point and I like discussion of the game mechanics also 
 MSmits: of D&amp;B for example
 jacek: or UTTT
 MSmits: are you trying to make sure re curse is really gone now jacek
 JBM: what? he's got a problem with uttt?
 MSmits: sort of i guess
 MSmits: not sure how deep it goes 
 jacek: deeper than your book
 MSmits: oof
 JBM: i'm surprised, i'd have thought that's the kind of multi he'c crave
 JBM: readjusting framing... complete
 MSmits: nah he doesnt like it and he does kind of have  a point
 jacek: its love-hare relationship
 jacek: hate even
 JBM: i'd follow on the uninterestingness aspect of the game
 MSmits: it's very hard to get a reading on that game as a human
 JBM: but there's a MIPS aspect i'd expect him to shine in
 MSmits: some weak heuristics you can use, but other than that you just try all sorts of random enhancements on mcts to see what sticks
 MSmits: he was hoping NN would help, but that failed also
 MSmits: I still have one thing on my list for uttt
 MSmits: wanted to try to solve it with proof number search 
 MSmits: probably out of reach, but the statespace is far smaller than most people think
 MSmits: maybe if the advantage of p1 is large enough, you can put lots of heuristics in that preserve the win for p1, you dont need to explore the entire tree that way
 MSmits: at worst, I end up with a nice solver to add to my meta mcts. Anyways, thats a long term idea
 AntiSquid: what NN did you do msd9126
 AntiSquid: MSmits
 MSmits: i didnt, recur se did
 MSmits: for uttt
 AntiSquid: always pinging wrong person lol
 JBM: and unpinging someone who left
 AntiSquid: ah i thought you did one for the dots games
 MSmits: he also played millions of games in a meta mcts to find patterns to help design his NN I think
 MSmits: nahh, i just ran a random sim to generate end games to test heuristics for
 AntiSquid: how come there's so many people to ping but hardly anyone typing stuff in chat&#160;?
 MSmits: turns out the heuristics from papers cover 0,3&#160;% of 7x7 endgames
 JBM: they're all on discord
 JBM: alternatively: "blame chat autojoin"
 JBM: 7x7 endgames?
 JBM: are we still on UTTT?
 MSmits: thats the D&amp;B size on CG
 MSmits: papers were written for 5x5 
 JBM: yeah that's what i thought
 JBM: i just missed the topicchange
 MSmits: the paper results are general to any size, just not useful
 MSmits: yeah I am lightning fast
 JBM: and subtle
 MSmits: so anyway, this kind of means my bot is 0,3% done :P
 MSmits: needs more heuristics
 dbdr: 7x7x7x7 uTTT would be a monster
 MSmits: how would the board switching work?
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid  07:59PMalways pinging wrong person lol
 eulerscheZahl: too many users online to auto-complete with just 2 letters
 MSmits: also dbdr... uttt? with 7 cells per miniboard?
 jacek: EveryOS?
 MSmits: I think I know why you're not top 10 in uttt :P
 AntiSquid: what's the secret to climbin in UTTT these days? quite sure my bot was around 60 at some point, #136 all of a sudden @_@
 MSmits: nothing new
 MSmits: I think top 20 or so have some heuristics
 MSmits: though, the teccles heuristic is quite powerful, maybe that caught on
 MSmits: if you put that in, you might get a good amount of ranks
 MSmits: if you dont know what it is, it's basically an early game heuristic for player 1
 AntiSquid: i remember it
 MSmits: if you arrive at an empty board, play the cell with the same index as the board itself, so the opponent is sent to the board you're already in
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: put it in
 MSmits: test it
 AntiSquid: send opponent back to same cell or something
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: my bot has it, even though it's not perfect
 AntiSquid: nah don't feel like it @_@ didn't even get the new games done yet
 jacek: my bot went from ~15 to ~7
 jacek: when i added this
 MSmits: nice
 AntiSquid: salad tomatoes #3
 MSmits: it's mostly because in the early game the rollout-statistics are very bad
 jacek: why tilde is more like minus here
 MSmits: so you need a heuristic that almost guarantees a good move
 AntiSquid: looks more like a tilde on ubuntu 
 MSmits: there's some for player 2, but they are worse, might not be worth it
 AntiSquid: or maybe it's the screen, not sure
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/w2MnNTf.png">https://i.imgur.com/w2MnNTf.png</a>
 MSmits: yea it looks like a minus for me too
 MSmits: at first i thought it was jacek-humor 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/B6HkjEi">https://imgur.com/a/B6HkjEi</a>
 jacek: nyoro~n
 AntiSquid: or maybe there's different font installed

 Hjax: recently when im home, the chat doesnt load on this site
 Hjax: anyone experienced that before?
 Hjax: theres just a white box where the chat is supposed to be 
 jacek: thats racist
 Hjax: :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: black boxes matter?
 Ace-Code: :D
 Ace-Code: XD
 eulerscheZahl: on a more serious note: chat is working fine for me
 Hjax: its only my desktop it doesnt work on 
 Hjax: i have no idea why, same browser / settings as other places i log in 
 eulerscheZahl: any errors in the console?
 Hjax: ill check when im home later
 jacek: suddenly im loading #3859980 channel o.O
 eulerscheZahl: is that a direct message?
 jacek: dunno, it only says the chat is loading
 jacek: MSmits have you seen the yet another hexagonal game?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: but i just randomly generated 1 million D&amp;B endgames out of which 3322 games were simple endgames and tested my heuristics compared to a negamax and they were identical each time. Yay endgame 0,3% solved&#160;:)
 MSmits: only took 10 seconds or so
 MSmits: on c++ debug mode
 jacek: you could be the guy who spent 8 years to solve 5x5
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: for now I seem to be the guy that spends that much time trying to beat your oware bot
 MSmits: some branches go 70 plies deep now :P
 jacek: youre just trying to outbook it
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: it's fun though
 MSmits: worked on everyone else so far, your bot is quite something
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95b1bcfa-502a-439f-b0bc-cd9b3e3169a6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95b1bcfa-502a-439f-b0bc-cd9b3e3169a6</a>
 MSmits: deepest so far, you're p2 
 MSmits: that one is actually close to the endgame book of 15 seeds
 MSmits: but not that useful if I am getting wrecked on that branch :P
 jacek: maybe i should learn about avx after all
 MSmits: from what I can tell it's mostly useful for those physics games
 MSmits: and othello
 jacek: nn is just vector dot product. i think its autovectorized in my case anyway
 MSmits: oh right, nns should use it too ofc
 MSmits: it seems annoying to avx it by hand only to find out there is no improvement due to autovectorization
 MSmits: in othello i did get an improvement, it was not autovectorized
 MSmits: just a tad too complicated to do that I guess
 MSmits: getting some stuff from the store bbl
 jacek: for bt i do incremental updates which sped up quite
 jacek: though for oware most moves change board drastically
 jacek: (still not bitboards)
 jacek: here at 63 frame i solved the win <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/482774691">https://www.codingame.com/replay/482774691</a>
 jacek: its not rocket science when at the end only 1 move is available
 jacek: for alphabeta i would need to use search extensions and whatnot, but in best first minimax i have this for 'free'
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: mcts solver does this too, though probably not as efficiently
 MSmits: what helps me a lot in these cases is a 6 seed endgame db
 MSmits: could have done the lookup at the depth of frame 79, which means I would have solved it much earlier
 MSmits: probably around 63 also
 Memo12334: in coders strike back. North is actually South right
 Memo12334: nvm
 Memo12334: stupid question
 MSmits: it depends on whether you mean the geographic north or the magnetic north

 Memo12334: MSmits sir do u understand this function, I understand everything fully except when doing the 360 - a thing
 Memo12334: I know a negative angle can be seen as positive by virtue of rotation
 Memo12334: and the dy part
 Memo12334: sry I should have asked this in discord , is any admin online
 PayItForward: first day here trying to learn c. where should i start
 PayItForward: i have no experience
 Jrix: Go on the doc
 PayItForward: I dont know what that is lol can i search for it
 mr.mister: doc is short for documentation
 PayItForward: ah thanks
 Jaek: Can i share my  contribution here&#160;?
 MSmits: Memo12334 sorry, that angle stuff always makes my head hurt. I usually try a few things until i find something that works
 MSmits: sometimes i am able to work it out on paper, but i lose it fast
 kvitebjonn: i cant find where to change my avatar, help
 norbi97: hover it on your profile, then you can click change picture
 itzblinkzy: markyy is it okay if you share your code? I failed miserably :pensive:
 itzblinkzy: alright then :cry:
 markyy: @itzblinkzy sure, just tell me which clash
 markyy: I did
 markyy: it's not readable though cause it's shortest code mode :sweat_smile:
 itzblinkzy: Yeah it's fine
 LinhT.Nguyen: yasuo change cai mode di
 LinhT.Nguyen: reverse kia
 markyy: did they fix the clash of code chat bug?
 markyy: it used to disappear during the contests
 zile151: i dont think they fixed the bug, but im not sure if thats a bug or a anti-collaboration feature lol
 LordSahandii: hi
 thanhphuoc: hello

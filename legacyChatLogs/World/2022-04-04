 tutubalin: how much effort would it take to count code length by bytes count, not characters count?
 tutubalin: we have to use utf16 hack now.but in my opinion it's exploit, not codegolf technique.
 Passifi: if it was counted by bytes count it wouldn't be the programmer who gets evaluated but the compiler optimization, non?
 darkhorse64: code length not executable size (which is meaningless for interpreted languages)
 Passifi: yeah that makes more sense, just out  of curiosity how does utf 16 save characters compared to other encoding formats&#160;?
 darkhorse64: utf-16 characters are counted as one character but use two bytes. So, counting code size by characters is somewhat flawed 
 Passifi: I got that one but unless there are some utf 16 characters that are worth two ascii characters that wouldn't change the final result so which utf16 characters are worth their weight in gold&#160;?&#160;:)

 coddednight: wym
 Uljahn: nobody knows everything
 coddednight: yeah but i dont know anything
 coddednight: im not good at coding at all honestly
 Uljahn: and what do you want exactly?
 coddednight: so i need help on mad pod racing in python 3
 Uljahn: understandable
 coddednight: so can u help
 Uljahn: idk
 coddednight: well do u know anybody who can
 Uljahn: maybe you should spend more time on learning the basics first if it seems too hard for you
 Uljahn: this site is not meant for complete beginners
 coddednight: wym the basics 
 a-Rye: coddednight, I'm working on a Beginner Python Concepts in the Activities -&gt; Learn. There's a more advanced cheat sheet for Python in my bio via my codepen site. For the more advanced stuff, try looking at other people's code after clashes. If you catch someone streaming their clashes, even better! You can ask questions in real time
 Westicles: Weird there isn't a FAQ for this question asked several million times now
 a-Rye: Or, you can use the chat for the class to ask questions too. But people often forget there are chats for each clash
 Hugesn0wduck: ello, i am back
 Hugesn0wduck: yall i need a lil help with a template that im making on scratch
 Hugesn0wduck: in scratch, its difficult to develop collision like standing on an object
 Hugesn0wduck: does anybody know how to do that?
 pjgamer: no
 Hugesn0wduck: hmm i have an idea maybe
 Hugesn0wduck: is there a chatroom for scratch?
 pjgamer: i am new
 pjgamer: i want to learn 
 Hugesn0wduck: awesome! glad you are getting into coding, make sure to not give up on your dreams
 BengLeZhenJun: I am new
 Hugesn0wduck: what language are you trying to learn?
 Hugesn0wduck: i would suggest starting with python, since its pretty easy to get the hang of
 pjgamer: do not know
 Hugesn0wduck: but you must learn, thats the way of coding
 pjgamer: ok
 pjgamer: tanks 
 Hugesn0wduck: if you are having troubles, click on my username to chat with me
 Hugesn0wduck: i can give you personal help in that chatroom
 Hugesn0wduck: just so there isnt confusion in this chat
 pjgamer: ok tanks 
 Hugesn0wduck: @thomasnicoullad
 Hugesn0wduck: oof pinging doesnt work
 Hugesn0wduck: [CG]Nonofr i have a question
 Hugesn0wduck: nvm ig im just alone in this chat xd
 eulerscheZahl: it's the internet, you are never alone
 Hugesn0wduck: true
 Hugesn0wduck: but i do have a question
 pjgamer: what
 eulerscheZahl: can i find it somewhere in the wall of text above?
 Hugesn0wduck: yes
 Hugesn0wduck: its about collision and gravity in the game that im making a template of
 Hugesn0wduck: im currently using scratch for a template maker
 eulerscheZahl: very specific, scratch is not a common language. i'd be surprised if anyone can answer
 Hugesn0wduck: mk
 Hugesn0wduck: i think i can find a way to do it myself
 Hugesn0wduck: just wanted to save a lil time xd
 cagriy: hello from istanbul
 Hugesn0wduck: hello
 Hugesn0wduck: I GOT IT
 Hugesn0wduck: it worked
 Hugesn0wduck: now imma have to do it 700 more times :tired_face:
 Hugesn0wduck: dude i hate coding sometimes, so time consuming
 PainEXE: If it was fast it wouldnt be fun
 Uljahn: actually you invest the time for future profits, that's how automation works
 Hugesn0wduck: true

 NewCoder09: TimberStalker You didn't get the achievements?
 PainEXE: Is clash of code not working for anyone else?
 Husoski: It's been sluggish on and off for me for months, usually right before or after an event.
 PainEXE: Was there an event?
 Uljahn: there are weekly events now, Activities -&gt; Events
 Husoski: The current brokenness started for me just after the COC event ended, Friday I think.

 dannyward630: why is COC so bogged down
 dannyward630:&#160;???
 Wontonimo: it's the orbiting mind probes.  too many people wearing tin hats these days, it overloads the network traffic in retrys
 dannyward630: now THAT is a good one.
 Wontonimo: but seriously, i have no idea.  maybe a server issue
 Wontonimo: :grin:

 Wontonimo: well, that was just mean
 eulerscheZahl: to whom?
 Wontonimo: 1 star?  why?
 Wontonimo: "stupid fdr"?  
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the twitch stream. thought you were referring to my comment
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't consider myself the target audience for the puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: some players want 100% even if that means doing some puzzles that don't require much thinking
 eulerscheZahl: i simply skip them
 Westicles: yeah me too
 Wontonimo: there is a difference between if the puzzle is well put together and advertises what it is vs you personally like the flavour.  This just is pissy
 Wontonimo: oh well.  teaches me for clicking the link
 eulerscheZahl: 1 star isn't justified. easy section, clear task and statement
 eulerscheZahl: might be better places in clashes, but it's sometimes hard to draw the line between those two
 Westicles: not every puzzle can be high quality like touching balls
 eulerscheZahl: of course an easy puzzle is boring for an advanced coder

 Wontonimo: oh ...
 eulerscheZahl: last one was about trucks/truckers
 eulerscheZahl: and their working conditions
 a-Rye: It was still fun though! Nice and easy. Gearing up for clashing, but it takes a certain energy to clash. Even more to stream the clash
 simejanko: Ye the entire society would go to shit if truckers stop working for 1 week

 eulerscheZahl: 3 days
 Wontonimo: but the long term result would be full automation of delivery 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a strong advocate of trains
 simejanko: Haha i'm glad you smelled my setup
 eulerscheZahl: i see, you are a man of culture
 a-Rye: Another approach is more focus on localized production. There's a second ZietGiest movie on the YouTubes about it
 Wontonimo: I thought it was something like, society is only 3 meals away from total anarchy 
 a-Rye: and I know several people opting to grow their own food when they can here in the states
 Wontonimo: and make their own bullet proof amour

 a-Rye: I think CodinGame is just having a heavy flow of traffic. That clashing I was just streaming was very slow.
 a-Rye: So achievement notifications might be lagging as well... saw someone else this morning didn't get an achievement either
 saylor: i received 100% and on the details page all validators are green
 Westicles: we have been beta testing the contest heavily, should speed up soon
 a-Rye: Ohh, that might do it!
 Stilgart: "Solve 100% of Mars Lander - Level 2 with at least 400l of fuel left on the 5th validation test."
 Stilgart: so 50% =&gt; 125xp, 100% =&gt; 125xp again

 ycsvenom: we know
 ycsvenom: lool
 Jojo42069: But does the world know :eyes:
 hobovsky: ,
 imathwee: why is the site down
 a-Rye: anyone can be big brains enough, just takes time and many clashes / puzzles / playgrounds
 ycsvenom: very true
 Sarstan: Like a friend was telling me. Getting the basics down in understanding how it works and syntax is the start. From there it's just learning what tools are out there.
 ycsvenom: i trained like that and look at me now i am the worst programmer ever :grimacing:
 Sarstan: I don't know man. There's the programmers at places like Tumblr. Can't do too much worse.
 a-Rye: right? Google Fu is key / being able to find those tools
 Sarstan: It's also realizing when you're struggling hard to solve something, there's probably a tool you don't know about to do it, lol.
 a-Rye: I just did a clash where I found the days of a month for a specific year...all just by importing a tool and feeding it the inputs. Felt like cheating 
 Sarstan: Oh yeah, just had one where you convert 24 hour time to 12 hour time. I copy and pasted, changed what I needed. Then ran out of time figuring out how to handle invalid entries.
 ycsvenom: in my opinion tools is for Pros,if you don't how to make the tool by yourself don't use it until you make a small replicaWhat do you think Uljahn , nicola?
 a-Rye: That's a good point. Be able to write the tool, but know it already exists and use that when able
 a-Rye: Then again, there are too many tools to really rewrite them all... or maybe that's just my excuse lol
 ycsvenom: you can use if you want tobut it would improve you coding skills and imagination if you code it yourself or even just think about it's structure 
 ycsvenom: my CoC rank is 666 right now lool
 a-Rye: nice lol
 a-Rye: mine keeps slipping. Haven't been getting a lot of the really easy ones, at least for me
 ycsvenom: i was 450 before 2 weeks but now i feel stupid :rolling_eyes:i don't know why i am forcing myself to attend to CoC's to improve my problem solving 
 AdemDj12: you have to enjoy the jorney bro
 Uljahn: CoC problems? lol
 ycsvenom: i know it's just a snacks Uljahn
 ycsvenom: what do you suggest?
 Uljahn: classic puzzles and multis
 Ahmed192_168_0_1: which alogorithms is best to learn for programming problems solving
 ycsvenom: do you have specific one in mind?
 ycsvenom: there is various kinds of algorithm each have special case to apply on
 a-Rye: several. Sorting algorithms are good as they show you arrays
 ycsvenom: so there is no standard one
 ycsvenom: it depends on the problem and domain
 Ahmed192_168_0_1: i didnt learn 
 a-Rye: I have some on Beginner Python Concepts under Activities -&gt; Learn. There are a lot of others, but for basics this one is decent
 Ahmed192_168_0_1: i was only learn languages and now i feel stuck in this  
 Ahmed192_168_0_1: i complete the basics and learn some libraries of python
 a-Rye: Ah. More advanced would be things like Graphs, Binary Search Trees, better Encryption 
 Ahmed192_168_0_1: where should I start
 a-Rye: Activities -&gt; Practice and find puzzles that sound fun. It takes a bit to get used to what they're looking for, but there are plenty that use these tougher algorithms
 ycsvenom: i don't know if this is a good advice but you shall start wonderinglike if you watch a video or read something you start to wonder "what if we change this" think about it and start codingprogramming is only gained by experience 
 Ahmed192_168_0_1: yeah bro but i, unfortunately, i am kind of good at maths but its not okay for me when i start coding i don't understand where to i start how to crack this thats why i join this type of websites i jus wanna improve
 a-Rye: Clashing is good. You can ask questions of the others clashing with you. Each clash has their own chat that is created. Also, streamers doing clashes are good to ask questions
 flofromproggresive: no one ever talks in the ones im in

 BenWo: hi BigBadStopwatch_4678the site is pretty active
 BenWo: though mostly during new contests
 kovi: search race - is it possible to access code in from the old "contribution" version?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5073253abaee2588a9f6daa66ac49205fa5a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5073253abaee2588a9f6daa66ac49205fa5a</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you are still not level 29 :o
 kovi: thx. it seems it is lost&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sli5uo">https://prnt.sc/sli5uo</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to promote first
 eulerscheZahl: why lost? i can download the code
 eulerscheZahl: including that useless .DS_Store that Illedan attaches everywhere
 kovi: well, no matter what i only see default code
 Marchete: wow, paid and forced approvers, nice Illedan :D
 kovi:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i definitely did something wrong for space maze. needed 4 attempts to be approved within 30 days
 Marchete: it's called money, euler
 eulerscheZahl: :money_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: so, let's try to send invalid input to crash the game, then shame approvers
 CyberLemonade: does c# have any errors like java's heap space?
 aCat: I was thinking Illedan wan't to improve and polish the game visuals etc...
 aCat: so hasty acc ;p
 eulerscheZahl: but then he couldn't wait any longer and wanted to publish it
 aCat: why he couldn't&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: because he's impatient and want everyone to see what he did
 aCat: ouh, yes
 WINWINWIN: Do the graphics help analyze replays?
 aCat: still he got plenty of space to make debug text so he limit it unnecessarily
 aCat: honestly - if i't baby step for csb than debug mode with visible vectors would be fantastic
 aCat: Profile picture&#160;!<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/c4a50746f425cb125f77487aaf51350c7258821">https://www.codingame.com/profile/c4a50746f425cb125f77487aaf51350c7258821</a>
 aCat: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you haven't seen that user before?
 eulerscheZahl: let me guess: locam card?
 aCat: yep
 jrke: hey i am solving temperatures its showing me 93% one validator error anybody knows whats wrong i did in my code
 eulerscheZahl: share your code
 jrke: if i got banned
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just a puzzle, not a contest
 eulerscheZahl: paste it in the chat
 JoeBodian: i'm at top of leaderboard of wood league one in coders strike back, but im not getting promoted? can anyone help??
 eulerscheZahl: are you above the boss?
 eulerscheZahl: did you submit reach 100%?
 eulerscheZahl: your*
 jrke: no 93%
 eulerscheZahl: @JoeBodian
 JoeBodian: i am above the boss
 anid: Submit has to be c completed JoeBodian
 JoeBodian: how do i know if my submit reaches 100%
 JoeBodian:&#160;?
 JoeBodian: sorry, im bery new to this site
 anid: Look at the leaderboard
 jrke: joeBodian click on battles you will see battle progress x% 
 anid: next to your name is there a circle or not?
 JoeBodian: there is not a circle
 JoeBodian: it says battles in progress 26%
 JoeBodian: is that what you mean?
 jrke: ya so what until this progress disappear
 anid: Yes, Nicely done! You beat the boss very quickly
 jrke: and you have to be above boss when its 100% means when it disappear
 jrke: then you will be promoted&#160;:)
 JoeBodian: do i have to keep pressing play and fast forward each time then??
 eulerscheZahl: no
 anid: No, it is automatically played
 eulerscheZahl: did you click "play" or "submit"?
 jrke: no
 JoeBodian: i clicked submit
 jrke: ya then just wait
 eulerscheZahl: then open the last battles on the left
 jrke: untill its 100%
 eulerscheZahl: there should be more battles coming, will stop at some time
 anid: CSB has a large league, so just wait for 10 mins for it to finish
 eulerscheZahl: when you are finished, you need to be above the boss for promotion
 jrke: yes CSB is eay as well as large leagues
 jrke: *easy
 eulerscheZahl: your submit is at 44% progress right now JoeBodian
 JoeBodian: how do i make the battles play automatically?
 anid: the submit button does that
 anid: just click submit and wait till it finishes
 eulerscheZahl: don't submit again, just wait a bit
 JoeBodian: okay, cool. Thanks for your help and advice folks
 JoeBodian: this site is great. it takes a bit of head scratching though
 eulerscheZahl: promoted
 Illedan: Hi
 NicatSadiqov: hi
 NicatSadiqov: hello
 NicatSadiqov: hehe
 Ace-Code: hii
 Ace-Code: How are you?
 tobk: Is it possible to "update" a published puzzle solution, or would that be a new published solution with different votes, comments, etc.?
 eulerscheZahl: will be new, old solution will be hidden then
 SabertheLost: So it turned out that my parsing of the pacman type always gave me undefined.That what I get for using a new langauge&#160;:) 
 IcedBlackSapphire: what clash of code is missing: a button "next challange". i don't want to submit, i want to just skip the challange or dismiss the challange
 SabertheLost: but that only changed like 100 spots in silver&#160;:)
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: whats up folks
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: quick question -- this has been around for a few years... is it still growing and adding new content??
 SabertheLost: There are challanges 2-4 time a year
 SabertheLost: Was one last week. 
 SabertheLost: Those are always new 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: how about the basic practice puzzles that seem to have about 50 or so per level (easy,medium, hard)
 struct: Some are made by the community
 struct: others are done by CG
 struct: Same for multiplayers / optimization puzzles
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: have those been growing, or mostly static&#160;? im looking less to compete, more to learn (for now). 
 struct: They grow
 struct: And there are a lot of them
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: awesome.. i was looking for ways to mess with new languages, of all the ways i've seen, this is the best and actually fun.
 struct: Also if you enjoy bot programming
 struct: There are plenty of games for that too
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: dont know about bots -- you mean physical machine?
 struct: Artificial intelligence
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/467996862">https://www.codingame.com/replay/467996862</a>
 struct: This was last contest
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: ah cool, yeah im into machine learning in python. have you found any other places similar to this site, or others that pair well with this for continual growth in various areas
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>you can even watch the puzzle section growing. these are pending. some will be approved sooner or later, others just disappear as they aren't good enough
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: very cool..
 IcedBlackSapphire: yeah, i'd also be interested in places similar to this website
 IcedBlackSapphire: have you found anything @BigBadStopwatch?
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i stumbled upon this place after someone in IRC (Freenode, #python) recommended it 
 IcedBlackSapphire: lol
 IcedBlackSapphire: people still use irc
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: yes, like the builders of the language 
 IcedBlackSapphire: didn't the builder of the language abandon it
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: there are folks in there who possess the skill of all stackoverflow #python in a pinky. very good resource.
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: I dont know what happened to guido, but i can say we still moved to ver 3 and dropped version 2 in 2020, so it lives on&#160;:)
 IcedBlackSapphire: of all stackoverflow #python? :D
 IcedBlackSapphire: finally you dropped version 2 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: sorry, meaning python tag
 IcedBlackSapphire: that's a good thing
 IcedBlackSapphire: yeah, i get what you mean
 IcedBlackSapphire: hopefully for python 4 it won't be the same situation with python 3 still being around and confusing ppl
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: ive been developing at work lately, perhaps the past 1.5 yrs... all python. i wanted to get away from it. Like growing up in a town you never left. This place has helped shake off the cobwebs..
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: how many languages have you dev'd in for these challenges?
 IcedBlackSapphire: only ruby
 IcedBlackSapphire: i learned my first bits in ruby 10 years ago
 IcedBlackSapphire: it's a big comfort zone
 IcedBlackSapphire: wouldn't give that up 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i dont know if it makes sense but i might try to get to easy level 10 in perhaps 5 langs
 IcedBlackSapphire: once fluent in one language it hardly matters
 IcedBlackSapphire: the other languages don't offer much benefits
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: Lol, i had the same urge to just use python. i couldnt stand the idea of doing a "challenge" and having no idea what to do"
 IcedBlackSapphire: i would just stick to python honestly
 IcedBlackSapphire: try to level up your problem solving skills
 IcedBlackSapphire: not your lang skills
 IcedBlackSapphire: and if the problem seems boring or too much text i'd just click "Submit" at 0%
 IcedBlackSapphire: there are only a few good problems here on clash of code
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: There's some truth to this -- the more advanced you are, the more advanced PROGRAMMING concepts/challenges you take on. This is where growth comes from
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: the language...is almost just a minor detail
 IcedBlackSapphire: all things are simple they're are just taught in a way that they're hard to grasp
 IcedBlackSapphire: put a n00b of physics or quantum computing into a room full with quantum scientists for 1 hr and they be able to explain quantum computing 
 IcedBlackSapphire: i'll be getting cigs, brb and thanks for the good talk (y)
 SabertheLost: Not if the noob just don´t want to know. Or the scientists just draws math on a board for 2 hours
 Uljahn: some algos make no sense in python within Codingame limitations, such as MCTS for uTTT in 100ms, it just doesn't converge with such a few rollouts
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: Uljahn interesting point...
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: IcedBlackSapphire i left because was looking for a pic to share on this concept
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: IcedBlackSapphire: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://3ovyg21t17l11k49tk1oma21-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/KxC.jpg">https://3ovyg21t17l11k49tk1oma21-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/KxC.jpg</a>
 Uljahn: i mean you could make MCTS in python for studying purposes but not expecting some meaningful results
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: it's an XKCD style comic: productivity = k x c... K= working knowledge of every programming language known to man, C= lines of code. Lol.. directly to Uljahn's point.. 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i joined the discord, is this chat in there?
 Uljahn: nope, this chat is xmpp based
 Uljahn: there is #general channel it's basically the same as #world
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: thanks, Uljahn,  how long have you been at this site training, and what have you focused on
 Uljahn: 4 years, studying python from scratch
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: interesting. I'm doing it just to look at other languages... get a feel for them, and to see if that gives me some flash of inspiration
 Uljahn: also there are some exceptional libraries available on CG to make python not so slow: numpy and scipy
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: good to know, ive heard things about numpy's speed
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: im a  python dev mostly
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: if you want to learn something cool, check out async (asyncio, trio, twisted are some libs that enable this)
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: its a mind bender, and better than multi-threading in most situations where folks think they want threading but really they just want async
 Uljahn: a pity we are given 1 core on CG so no benefits of multithreading
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: submit 100 http requests and wait for all the results, collect them as they come in, all with a single thread.
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://realpython.com/async-io-python/">https://realpython.com/async-io-python/</a>
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: it takes about a week to wrap your head around, but allows you to imitate multi threading w/ single thread.. also, if you dont use that site for learning, you should, the quality is through the roof. i've been leaning on it for like a year.
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: and #python on irc freenode server... amazing resource with super talented devs in there, all wanting to give advice and correct code/help solve challenges. They were the ones that told me to use async instead of multi-threading, lots of painful growth began that day.
 Uljahn: sorry, im not a dev and not a pro coder :sweat:
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: well, just look at the most simple tutorial on that page for async (queue consumer / producer) it will change your view of what python can do.
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: if there are no async challenges here, maybe i will write one
 AntiSquid: so many people without avatars, hard to tell who is who
 WINWINWIN: Yes, avatar is mandatory
 AntiSquid: to avoid confusion definitely
 WINWINWIN: And AntiSquid, meant to thank you for your Poker Chip Race referee
 AntiSquid: it's not mine
 AntiSquid: it's CG's
 WINWINWIN: How did you get it then?
 WINWINWIN: I could not find it online, it would be useful to have a hypersonic referee as well
 AntiSquid: there is to be a slack server for CG where about 50 different people worked in teams on different games, the referees were shared there, but nobody shared any further, just kept it to themselves
 AntiSquid: used to be *
 WINWINWIN: Ok, so can use your collection, agades and eulerscheZahl`s then
 AntiSquid: obviously
 AntiSquid: if the hypersonic referee isn't there then i don't have it, but that one isn't as hard to reverse engineer as some other ones
 AntiSquid: wait it is there
 WINWINWIN: Only searched HyperSonic Referee on google to get eulerscheZahl`s
 WINWINWIN: but his did not have a pathfinder
 eulerscheZahl: a random ping happened
 eulerscheZahl: and another one
 WINWINWIN: so I took the one from pacman and modified it
 WINWINWIN: sry that was me
 WINWINWIN: should not have used the full name
 njtan142: hey guys
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure AntiSquid published HyperSonic
 WINWINWIN: Will check it
 eulerscheZahl: and reimplemented it before the official one got leaked
 struct: What game is coming next?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/p38W4wH.png">https://i.imgur.com/p38W4wH.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a puzzle about knight moves
 struct: Yesterday I could not fall asleep thinking about it&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you are having a crysis now that yinsh is almost finished?
 struct: Yes, now I want to port this game
 jacek: i love making new projects and not finishing ones
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 jacek: isolation game?
 KnightMoves:&#160;??
 AntiSquid: winwinwin&#160;?
 struct: isolation is 7x7
 AntiSquid: it's there check same repo as the other ones
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear. wasn't thinking about you KnightMoves
 struct: Ok but Ill finish yinsh first
 struct: Ill try to get everything done today
 AntiSquid: struct your head got bigger
 struct: Then ill do arimaa
 jacek: is it free though
 struct: "Game instructions are not clear!" on yinsh comment
 struct: lol
 struct: What is free jacek?
 eulerscheZahl: it's like free Willy
 AntiSquid: Arimaa is a two-player strategy board game that was designed to be playable with a standard chess set and difficult for computers while still being easy to learn and fun to play for humans. It was invented in 2003 by Omar Syed, an Indian-American computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence.
 struct: Arimaa was mentioned here before
 struct: plenty of times I think
 AntiSquid: stop being stingy, pay for a CG premium account. then it won't matter which games on here are free or not
 AntiSquid: jacek
 struct: Im gonna try to make Yinsh pieces circles to see if it looks better
 struct: tbh I cant understand what is going on on current viewer
 ZarthaxX: isolation coming to cg? :O
 AntiSquid: arimaa rules <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_nGecwCDnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_nGecwCDnk</a> sounds kinda confusing
 struct: ZarthaxX give me diea for design
 struct: you have degree in design help me
 ZarthaxX: design for what
 struct: Yinsh
 ZarthaxX: mhm
 struct: it looks like sh*T
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: i have my design for isola hehe
 struct: isola*
 ZarthaxX: wat
 struct: *?
 struct: Isolation I guess
 ZarthaxX: isolation
 ZarthaxX: yes
 ZarthaxX: what's up with yinsh
 struct: the design is terrible
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/oISwJ1d.png">https://i.imgur.com/oISwJ1d.png</a>
 struct: Dont know who created this
 ZarthaxX: doesnt look bad
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: *you*
 eulerscheZahl: no struct
 eulerscheZahl: you are talking to tobou now
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 struct: You think this design is fine?
 ZarthaxX: hi toady
 ZarthaxX: i like simple stuff like that
 ZarthaxX: looks geometrically appealing
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: lemme look at the original
 AntiSquid: use astral bodies instead of weird circles
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll
 ZarthaxX: the fuck :P
 ZarthaxX: struct board has another layout tho
 ZarthaxX: the crossing lines
 eulerscheZahl: does it work?
 ZarthaxX: wat
 eulerscheZahl: tried yesterday, no effect
 struct: I guess I can draw the lines
 ZarthaxX: what are you talking about
 struct: and enable a toggle
 AntiSquid: the original does look different / better
 struct: if toggle lines else show this mess
 jrke: hey how can i pass PCR wood 2 
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.boardspace.net/yinsh/english/rules_files/diag3.gif">https://www.boardspace.net/yinsh/english/rules_files/diag3.gif</a>
 ZarthaxX: want that?
 struct: yeah i guess
 AntiSquid: by beating the wood 2 boss
 ZarthaxX: what about drawing those lines first
 struct: I need math expert to teach me
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl
 struct: Ok its easy
 struct: Tobou told me
 eulerscheZahl: ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: your brother heh
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl he said math expert
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: you are math guru euler
 eulerscheZahl: i wasn't aware
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for the honors
 AntiSquid: now go forth and test your math skills
 struct: First I need to see if circle looks better than 
 struct: hex
 cegprakash: about 100 ppl are clashing r n on same clash
 ZarthaxX: oh... true
 cegprakash: codingarden is on fire
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1229736261bb695f803d0bef57608fcacb96d61">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1229736261bb695f803d0bef57608fcacb96d61</a>
 ZarthaxX: the definition sucks right?
 struct: definition?
 ZarthaxX: graphics
 ZarthaxX: when doing circles
 trictrac: hello all, struct&#160;: yinsh looks good
 eulerscheZahl: i thought clashes are limited to 8 players? :o
 ZarthaxX: looks pixelated¡?
 trictrac: great job
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden">https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden</a> is streaming COC
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl come
 struct: Thanks trictrac, did you find any bugs?
 ZarthaxX: trictrac i feel you get impressed easily :P
 struct: I tried to implement all original rules
 struct: Besides steal move
 trictrac: not yet my old bot needs some adaptation on notations
 trictrac: i submit and no problem
 struct: ok, dont also forget that all moves must be done on same turn
 trictrac: but only 10 match per submit
 trictrac: it's too low
 struct: its because its not aprooved yet
 struct: Also I saw some Yinsh matches and they seem to avoid playing on middle 
 oscekh: are there any settings to remove method suggestions + method documentation on hover from the (clash) editor?
 AntiSquid: F1
 struct: Am I the only one that cant copy text from chat with right click?
 oscekh: I can
 struct: On firefox I can
 struct: but on chrome not
 struct: strange
 Snef: i can on chrome
 oscekh: @AntiSquid is that permanent? And can I change settings outside a game, or do I have to open some practice thing?
 oscekh: Either way I can't find the correct setting in F1
 struct: Does it look better with circles?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/89SZiEH.png">https://i.imgur.com/89SZiEH.png</a>
 AntiSquid: why that color scheme?
 AntiSquid: and yes imo
 struct: I dont know what colors to use
 AntiSquid: black white or something close to them
 jacek: circles are better
 struct: Okay, circles it is
 cegprakash: Illedan that's wrong dude.. u are not adding all possible sums
 eulerscheZahl: shame on you Illedan!which context?
 Illedan: Clash
 struct: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: you lost a clash?
 Illedan: nah
 Illedan: 2nd in shortest
 Illedan: with C#
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: and the question doesn't ask you to sum and ceg did?
 cegprakash: but his solution is wrong
 cegprakash: I reported that clash for weak testcases
 jacek: yeah, why you didnt invite euler
 Illedan: Mine is right
 cegprakash: u are not adding all possible sums
 Illedan: I do
 struct: What was the clash?
 Illedan: Ah
 Illedan: not all
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Most
 Illedan: xD
 cegprakash: in what order do u give denominations
 cegprakash: wait I have ur code
 cegprakash: I'll find a case where urs fail
 Illedan: I should repeat that foreach N times
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/eNi3IG">https://ideone.com/eNi3IG</a>
 cegprakash: see this Illedan
 cegprakash: yes that's what I mean
 cegprakash: ur solution is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: willing to tell us the question?
 cegprakash: may be if u do lot of iterations it can work
 cegprakash: fulfilling denominations eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: 5+7+7 = 19 so it should return Yes
 cegprakash: but Illedan's solution returns No
 cegprakash: but he got 100 in the clash
 eulerscheZahl: 0 results found
 eulerscheZahl: 1 hit for denomination (without plural form): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1121feae3b94d146df78469feac62b33ede2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1121feae3b94d146df78469feac62b33ede2</a>

 BenjaminUrquhart: k
 DiL: Hello! I used the disableChat=True parameter to hide chat while coding, but it seems to be no longer working... Does anyone know if there's a way to disable chat or prevent focus to be assigned to chat input box while editing?
 Neumann: Illedan: I keep having random fails on SR, not always on the same tests .. Weird
 struct: its bugged DiL
 struct: everyone chat is disabled on IDE
 Snef:  i have chat in ide struct
 BenjaminUrquhart: mine isn't
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm in IDE
 struct: oh its fixed
 BenjaminUrquhart: DiL you can collapse the window or inspect element it out
 struct: I didnt read his entire sentece 
 struct: So I assumed
 struct: Now i read and understand
 BenjaminUrquhart: it just eats the parameter
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 struct: maybe they disabled it
 struct: to fix the other problem
 DiL: BenjaminUrquhart yes, it would be nice to have a "focus" mode in settings so that there would be no need to hide chat manually! thanks btw
 DiL: struct I also believe it caused other bugs so it has been removed... sadly
 cegprakash: does anybody wants to costream with me?
 BenjaminUrquhart: define costream
 cegprakash: so u join me on discord through audio
 cegprakash: while I code
 cegprakash: and the viewers can hear both of us
 cegprakash: but they can only see my face because I don't really know how to enable two web cams :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: I can't, I'm busy until around 5pm EST
 struct: MSmits on?
 AntiSquid: oh damn ide chat is back
 struct: kinda slow though
 DiL: AntiSquid did you used disableChat parameter to hide chat?I did and it's no longer working...
 Astrobytes: Confirmed.
 Astrobytes: Just reported it in the bug channel on Discord
 cegprakash: in pacman as depth increases is linear decay good or exponential decay good?
 cegprakash: linear decay seem to work slightly better for my bot
 Astrobytes: Then use linear decay
 cegprakash: but some ppl use exponential decay&#160;:\ 
 cegprakash: may be as I go huge depth of 20 linear depth is better for me?
 Astrobytes: Your bot is not 'some people's' bot
 Astrobytes: Try it out and see.
 cegprakash: in exponential decay my last 5 depths have very very low score
 Astrobytes: There's not usually a one-size-fits-all solution, it depends on how you're approaching the problem and your implementation
 cegprakash: unlike linear decay
 BenjaminUrquhart: have you tried just doing it and seeing what happens
 Astrobytes: ceg the exponential decay will obviously reduce your score er... exponentially more the deeper you go. It depends on your eval scoring
 struct: Time to write Yinsh essay
 Astrobytes: And of course, by how much you are exponentially decaying per depth 
 struct: Ill just copy Yavalath statement style I guess
 Astrobytes: Yes struct, that style should work perfectly for Yinsh
 Snef: Astrobytes o/
 Astrobytes: Hi Snef, wassup
 struct: Yeah, but it takes so much time to make the pictures
 Snef: Astrobytes good good, i'm waiting you on search race :p
 Astrobytes: Couple of screenshots and some arrows here and there should suffice struct
 Astrobytes: lol Snef, won't be tonight, but I'm coming for ya :D
 Astrobytes: Epic score btw, gtratz&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *gratz
 struct: wownice
 struct: You have search snef?
 Snef: noice i was first yersteday but now there is re curse so i abandoned the idea of being first haha 
 Snef: yea i reused a part of my csb search and i tweeked it 
 kovi: so first re-use than re-curse
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Snef: lol
 Snef: are you joining SR soon kovi&#160;?
 kovi: working on it
 Illedan: \o/
 kovi: my csb code is messy
 Snef: yea i had to do some clean up too :p
 Snef: to debug how fast the search converge you check how much iteration is needed to get a fixed score&#160;?
 Astrobytes: My CSB code is also a large mess
 jrke: My all codes are large mess :smiley:
 kovi: ouch, tests are ok, but submit is not
 Snef: Yeah me too, i have to do multiple submit to get 100%, often i have 98%
 kovi: nah, i have a bug. only 80%
 struct: Cant beat my Yinsh mess
 Snef: I have a questionwhen i debug, i always get same score for the first turn.so i tried to do one random before the search and i got different score but it's different each time, why it is so&#160;?
 ShannonNorris97: Just checking the chat's working cause I sent a message that never went through
 ShannonNorris97: oh it's working now, weird
 ShannonNorris97: Is there a way on codingame to check how many milliseconds each turn is taking? Looking at how to do this in Python, everyone on stack overflow seems to be arguing that everyone's doing it the wrong way without providing the right way
 eulerscheZahl: classics, fights on the internet
 eulerscheZahl: import timestart_time = time.time()
 BenjaminUrquhart: just pick a way and do it
 Astrobytes: hi euler
 struct: import timestart = time.process_time()
 eulerscheZahl: i would just go with this and see if there are unexpected timeouts
 ShannonNorris97: That was my original approach, but apparently you can't use it for milliseconds because it's nowhere near accurate enough
 Astrobytes: And make sure you do this *After reading the first input*
 eulerscheZahl: and make sure to start the timer ...yeah Astrobytes was faster
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: MSmits here?
 struct: Need him
 ShannonNorris97: I'll just try a few and see if it works out. I was mainly just checking if this was something that codingame provided already that I may have just not noticed
 Astrobytes: And don't forget the first turn is 1s so you may have to restart after the read in the first turn
 Astrobytes: *during the read
 eulerscheZahl: time checking is language specific. nothing that CG does differently
 Astrobytes: *second turn
 ShannonNorris97: okay, thank you both
 Astrobytes: You're welcome
 mohammadhei05: heloo
 mohammadhei05: how are yo
 mohammadhei05: which language do you write a program in&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: in D
 Astrobytes: There is only D
 pb4: Snef&#160;: why abandon&#160;?
 jacek: D#
 Snef: pb4 because i feel i'm not good enough to grind efficiently
 reCurse: Snef: There is almost no difference between search and no search on my end
 reCurse: Except that it takes 4500x more time
 Astrobytes: Look at your score tho' Snef
 Snef: reCurse could you communicate your best times for Tokyo and line is it doesn't bother you&#160;?
 Snef: if *
 Snef: Astrobytes i really feel my score isn't that good
 pb4: do the validators have names&#160;?!
 reCurse: Didn't keep track of my alltime best
 Snef: pb4 the last ones yea
 struct: What is your best Snef?
 Astrobytes: Only some pb4, a few were handpicked
 Snef: for which struct&#160;?
 struct: Tokyio
 kovi: those are good scores
 struct: Tokyo*
 Astrobytes: Come on Snef, that's damn good
 Snef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/468293130">https://www.codingame.com/replay/468293130</a>
 Astrobytes: And you *know* you can make some improvements
 reCurse: For Tokyo I have 108.88
 Snef: Astrobytes regarding what i did i really think someone good can do better, or i was just lucky
 struct: nice I get 114.51
 Astrobytes: That's a bit defeatist Snef, don't be so hard on yourself
 Snef: i'm not hard i'm realistic lol
 Astrobytes: If you want to achieve, work to achieve
 Astrobytes: (Got my motivational head on today)
 Snef: ofc (haha)
 Snef: but i don't know exactly how should i do to do proper local test
 Snef: without it i can't improve
 Astrobytes: Write a local arena I guess?
 Astrobytes: The map gen. code is in the repo
 pb4: Snef&#160;: linux or windows&#160;?
 pb4: (or something else&#160;? :D)
 Snef: windows

 m1el: hey
 m1el: why did my points get reset to 0
 CodeCreativity: hello
 CodeCreativity: can anyone explain to me why this works
 CodeCreativity: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e143c6c-b5c9-4d4d-9db1-5e56b65f4919">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e143c6c-b5c9-4d4d-9db1-5e56b65f4919</a>
 jacek: why wouldnt
 m1el: this doesn't work because this is infinite loop
 CodeCreativity: it did
 m1el: maybe it throws on the last readline() because it's EOF
 CodeCreativity: EOF?
 Astrobytes: End of file
 Astrobytes: The infinite loop is there until CG server receives all the responses it requires, then terminates
 Snef: pb4 so no arena for windows i guess&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It looks a bit counter-intuitive at first sight but it's how it works on CG
 Astrobytes: Snef, since it's single player it should be easy enough to implement in VS
 Astrobytes: (without much effort I mean)
 Astrobytes: Just make your referee, generate maps, feed it your bot and gather stats
 YurkovAS: Snef i'm run all tests like this (change 2 variables)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/QWFLHhpQ">https://pastebin.com/QWFLHhpQ</a>
 Astrobytes: O you can use brutaltester for optims
 Astrobytes: That did not occur to me
 Snef: so i need the referee and you firl YurkovAS that's all&#160;?
 Snef: file *
 YurkovAS: Snef, yes, download referee, save this file to tests dir, open in ide (intellij idea) and run method from ide.
 Astrobytes: Hm. It's not slow?
 YurkovAS: Astrobytes yes, slow. not hard to add concurrency.
 Astrobytes: Guess so. I'm just allergic to Java :P
 CodeCreativity: you guys are speaking gibberish but thank you anyways
 Snef: i think i'll try to do my own setup in vs so that i can learn too
 JBM: everybody is Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: If you need any visualisation Snef I recommend OpenGL or SFML (built on OpenGL, SDL, or even OLC PCE (Pixel game engine - 1 header file), ImGui if you need a nice simple UI (haven't tried it with the PGE but apparently doable) 
 JBM: there's just those who know and those not yet
 Astrobytes: *PGE not PCE
 Astrobytes: lol JBM
 Snef: Astrobytes i think i'll just do commande line output or store score in a file ^^
 Astrobytes: All good Snef, sometimes helps with visuals (plus it's a fun project)
 Astrobytes: JBM are you not gonna make the TvC WIP public?
 JBM: eventually
 JBM: got mucha breaking changes incoming
 JBM: it's been 3 days, gimme a break
 JBM: it's not secret anyway, share at will
 Astrobytes: hehe, no worries man
 struct: No, you must get spammed until you finish
 JBM: just broke the stone counter for you
 JBM: but "fixed' smth that was broken from the start at last
 Astrobytes: Only you and Illedan get the spam treatment struct :P
 Illedan: And I'm done :D
 JBM: for now
 Illedan: Jk, I'm adding stuff atm
 Illedan: But only visuals and minor fixes
 Astrobytes: Custom maps?
 Illedan: I realised there was a bug too. If you drive so fast that you visit 2 checkpoints on 1 turn. It will only register 1 -.-
 reCurse: ...................
 kovi: i was thinking about that and what about 3?
 Astrobytes: ffs Illedan
 Illedan: ...
 reCurse: illedaaaaaaaaaaan
 Astrobytes: fix it
 Snef: i assumed it wasn't possible so i don't check that too xd
 Illedan: Yeeeeeah
 Illedan: But you would need INSANE speed
 Illedan: And that is not optimal anyway
 Illedan: but I'm fixing...
 darkhorse64: The statement says that positions are rounded when the referee truncats them
 darkhorse64: *truncates*
 Illedan: Ah, ty

 Snef: did you add bonus to cp struct&#160;?
 kovi: you limit thrust to 0 and 200?
 Astrobytes: lol, "Hmmm, will I, no, I hate 7, but I wanna go to 7, no I don't"
 struct: yes snef, I think my bug is in my collision time
 Snef: who kovi&#160;?
 struct: I havent tried to find the bug yet
 kovi: struct
 struct: yes kovi
 struct: 0 200
 kovi: that is the problem
 kovi: i have been there
 Snef: i'm not sure that it it
 Snef: also do you score after all turn or each turn struct&#160;?
 struct: all turn
 Snef: so getting cp turn 1 isn't better than getting it last turn for you&#160;?
 struct: right
 struct: might be due to that too
 Snef: and also what depth do you have&#160;?
 reCurse: Your bot is slacking off like you with yinsh
 Snef: OOF
 struct: depth 4
 struct: Im only missing statement&#160;:(
 Illedan: Add Decay struct?
 Snef: you should try higher depth ot's not like csb
 struct: Ill see what I can do, thanks for the tips
 struct: I probably will not work on it today though
 kovi: the problem is: taking 200 on first step brings too far from next target...almost all of the time its better to take 0
 Illedan: You need to search deeper than depth 10
 Scarfield: if you reduce the score too much by distance to the next CP, you could get a higher score by not getting the current CP, instead of taking it and get further away from the next CP
 darkhorse64: This one is good quite good <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/468497011">https://www.codingame.com/replay/468497011</a>

 WINWINWIN: Am starting and wanted tips
 reCurse: Align stones of the same color
 WINWINWIN: Illedan search race has been approved?
 WINWINWIN: reCurse, will start with that but is it enough for Bronze?
 reCurse: Probably? I dunno
 struct: You dont even need that for bronze
 WINWINWIN: K, will try it&#160;:)

 Snef: do one column per color and once you have one offset it by 1

 sugam: Guys, I was invited for codin game test after i applied for one of the internships 
 sugam: how do you suggest I should practice for it
 hypers: hey, idk details of your test or internship
 hypers: but I would spend 50% at CoC as universal excercise
 hypers: the rest 50% would follow the QUEST MAP (below at your home page)
 hypers: CoC = Clash of Code
 sugam: I see..
 sugam: I registered for this site last time when our college did the competition thing.
 sugam: and i haven't visited since.
 hypers: competition is always good as it motivates a lot and gives you experience to plan and act in a rush
 eulerscheZahl: try some easy/medium puzzles to get used to the website
 eulerscheZahl: the interview can have different types of questions. some are very similar to those puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: there are also multiple choice questions. it's up to the employer to decide about the type of question
 sugam: Codingame test, i'll be giving that test on this platform
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/">https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/</a>there are a few screenshots

 sugam: Looks cool enough. 
 sugam: wish me luck
 hypers: You can do it!
 hypers: and meet you in Coc
 sugam: hey hypers
 sugam: why did i get 75%
 sugam: does that mean 75% of the test cases were correct?
 hypers: yes
 hypers: share the code
 hypers: we can spot the problem
 sugam: look
 sugam: ohhh
 sugam: I looped through all of it
 sugam: while I assigned i as int, and the n was long. I got an error for long values
 hypers: probably
 jacek: oh my
 sugam: guys do you have any tips for me to get remote internships? Companies at my countries are really bad and I think getting a remote internship Eu/US would be better for my growth. 
 jacek: youre magus reversed :o
 sugam: ohh
 MACKEYTH: Anyone familiar with the Fall 2020 challenge referee?
 eulerscheZahl: the engine was simple enough to play the game without referee
 eulerscheZahl: can't you just skip the introduction and come to the real question?
 MACKEYTH: What's the behavior when casting a spell if you don't have inventory room for all the new ingredients?

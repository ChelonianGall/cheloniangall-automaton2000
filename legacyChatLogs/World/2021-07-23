 Peached: hi, im new to clash of code
 Peached: can someone tell me what to expect
 Peached: oh wow lets go
 Peached: 2nd place how did i
 pyprog: great man!
 BlaiseEbuth: No mods here&#160;? -_-
 BlaiseEbuth: Use #clash for sharing clash links and invite people guys. Thanks.
 derjack: maybe they arent paid enough
 BlaiseEbuth: Paid? :money_mouth:
 dbdr: 1 kick = 1 XP1 ban = 10 XP
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll be xp first  since a long time if that was the case...&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Me: Doing the 15 puzzles in Pascal achievement and searching how to sort an array.Qwant: Meet Mr Pascal Sort, customer manager, on Linkedin.
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: in pascal, you do buble sort
 dbdr: (hint: pascal was my second language after basic)
 BlaiseEbuth: The sort type doesn't matter, is there any native function&#160;?
 derjack: stalin sort in O(n)
 dbdr: my comment is to be understood in the same vein as "in COBOL, it's a type error not to wear a white shirt and a blue tie"
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't get it...&#160;:(
 derjack: thats the advantage of UDP - i dont care
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ac6264b6-ef79-45f7-a9f6-1b8c61c46c3b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ac6264b6-ef79-45f7-a9f6-1b8c61c46c3b</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: :no_mouth:
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh... I've done pascal during an internship few years ago (really, 2013), but I didn't remember it was so old...
 derjack: hedgewars is/was written in pascal no?
 BlaiseEbuth: Pascal/C++/Haskell... wth
 derjack: server in haskell
 Illedan: Agreed on the format of the position dbdr. I'll just move it into a list like the food
 Illedan: Was like this when it was a multiplayer
 BlaiseEbuth: Snake Illidan! &lt;3 I'll take a look once pascal buried.
 ChampKai: :grin:
 Illedan: Should I change the scoring?
 Illedan: Better to see 1 more score per step faster you solve a level?
 Illedan: 600 + 25000 - steps?(only + 25000 if a level is solved)
 BlaiseEbuth: Not in WIP... Aren't you afraid of a savage validation Illedan&#160;?
 Illedan: Moved to WIP now
 Illedan: ty
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 BlaiseEbuth: What?! The map isn't cyclic?!
 Illedan: nah :P 
 Illedan: You want that?
 Illedan: hmmm
 BlaiseEbuth: Was the case on the snakes I played. But perhaps not a good idea here. Don't know...
 derjack: huh?
 Illedan: Will just make the game simpler?
 derjack: i always played with walls around map
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes. For an optim game walls are better.
 Illedan: darkhorse64, the position format is now building. Soon on a server near you.
 Illedan: Unless I broke something ^^
 Illedan: Seems right&#160;:)
 Illedan: 486331 is my current score :tada:
 Illedan: Anyone better? :D
 darkhorse64: Changes downloaded
 Illedan: Lol, trying to print all 25000 moves in 1 go gives a timeout xD
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm.. The 'input during the while loop' doesn't seems very clear to me...
 BlaiseEbuth: Mostly beacause of the order.
 BlaiseEbuth: *because
 Illedan: On those 4 first ints?
 BlaiseEbuth: The fact that all var explanations come at the end. 
 Illedan: Ah, I can move it to right after each line
 BlaiseEbuth: I think it'll be clearer yes.
 Illedan: On it
 Illedan: I'll also make the food spawn flipping to make it closer to each other
 Illedan: BlaiseEbuth, makes sense now? (updated)
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, much better.
 BlaiseEbuth: Btw. Is giving the seed each turn necessary?
 BlaiseEbuth: Just once with height and width will be enough, isn't it?
 KiwiTae: Illedan you are making a snake game?
 BlaiseEbuth: C'mon kiwi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7158e51466a40b049897dd44c641191a2119">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7158e51466a40b049897dd44c641191a2119</a>
 Illedan: Sure, you can calc it yourself BlaiseEbuth, but I think it is better to give each round to use for validation that your logic is correct too
 Illedan: I'm off for a few hours. I'll make it Ready for publish later unless you find something more&#160;:) bye
 KiwiTae: oooh sweeet 
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. You mean the seed change? I thought it was constant, that's why
 Illedan: It is used to spawn food
 Illedan: For perfect sim
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. Got it.
 KiwiTae: pewpew
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey KiwiCave!
 BlaiseEbuth: Or ZenosTae&#160;? :thinking:
 KiwiTae: u way too fasty&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: :race_car:
 derjack: racecar? tacocat?
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh. I haven't seen the clash chat Kiwi... Yet other haters...
 Manopphysics: No U
 MSmits: yay, finally getting some wins vs mikla 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits</a>
 MSmits: look at that 100% vs everyone else too :P
 MSmits: mikla is so tough&#160;:(  
 Marchete: :tada:
 MSmits: still doing random moves until i start  nim solving
 MSmits: maybe i should give the loopy thing another shot
 Marchete: "some wins" == 100% winrate vs 1st
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: 4-10
 MSmits: but winning 4 is huge. It used to be 1-20 or something
 Marchete: again, 100% winrate vs everyone else
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's the nim thing really
 MSmits: it really decides everything and mikla is still a little better at it
 MSmits: or he does something in the early game
 MSmits: and i do not know what
 MSmits: I tried a simplified nim-mcts but by the time there is "any" deviation from 50% win probability, the board is already nim-solved and it's pointless information
 MSmits: and thats simplified, so not including sacrifice moves
 MSmits: nim solving is so much stronger than mcts, that it becomes useless =/
 Marchete: why not both?
 MSmits: I mean using both, it becomes useless
 Marchete: why?
 MSmits: because the mcts will give you 50% WR on each move
 MSmits: until you solve it
 MSmits: so why even search
 MSmits: you cant combine the information really, just use the mcts until you solve, but if there's never any benefit...
 MSmits: you *can* affect the overall structure of the map though
 MSmits: but that doesn't tell you who wins, at least not with the loopy thing
 Marchete: I'd like to use NN
 Marchete: but it seems hard
 MSmits: NN might do better here
 MSmits: in the early phase that is
 MSmits: I know there's some information you can use from chain counting
 MSmits: but by then the chains arent done yet. The NN might be able to guess though
 Marchete: "graph info"
 MSmits: right
 derjack: graph games?
 Marchete: dots and boxes
 derjack: are there any other graph games
 BlaiseEbuth: ghost in the cell
 derjack: that could be manually played on paper using pencil ~
 BlaiseEbuth: And so it's not a graph game&#160;?
 derjack: :s
 MSmits: mmh gitc is a graph game, but the graph is constant during the game, so far less interesting
 MSmits: eulers triangle game is a real graph game
 dbdr: someone create ultimateGITC with changing graph&#160;;)
 MSmits: gitc is hard enough as it is
 MSmits: just not the graph part
 MSmits: the hard part is the extreme amount of options you have, like in a multi agent game
 struct: dbdr you can change the graph on try angle catch
 dbdr: hard is relative.gitc worked out easily for me, old Java bot
 struct: i have no idea how to code a bot for gitc tbh
 dbdr: tge I'm not even legend
 derjack: whats with leadeboard in amazons :s
 struct: he is catching up o.o
 pyprog: hello coders
 struct: Cant say the same about my bt bot, i still have 0% win rate vs NNs&#160;:(
 derjack: dont worry, theres slight chance they may timeout, no?
 struct: That doesnt really count
 derjack: 7th is very good
 struct: is it?
 derjack: above tric so its like the mine nonNN
 struct: I see, mine is mcts with ept
 struct: yesterday I improved eval a bit
 struct: I still have some stuff to do to improve hte bot
 Illedan: dbdr, any other finds in Snake? Or should I move it to ready state?
 dbdr: i'm writing a dumb AI right now
 Illedan: I only read the head position in mine xD
 dbdr: don't you die?&#160;:)
 dbdr: score?
 Illedan: Finish all maps but 2
 Illedan: Points   501,889
 dbdr: lucky then? or you remember your direction?
 Illedan: nah
 Illedan: You can figure it out&#160;;)
 Thamidu: Hello
 dbdr: I mean, with the head you can figure the rest if you store it, sure :D
 Illedan: Not stored
 Illedan: No data inbetween rounds
 dbdr: don't even need the head
 dbdr: didn't you change the food gen? was there always a single food in 1337?
 Illedan: I just changed it a little yeah
 Illedan: I move from min of 3 to min of 1
 Illedan: I think 1 food gives other challenges than 20 food
 Illedan: Which makes it more fun
 dbdr: probably, yes
 Illedan: So food amount is from 1-30
 Illedan: Which should prob be in the statement ^^
 dbdr: yeah
 Illedan: ok, updated
 eulerscheZahl: hi Illedan, got your message
 eulerscheZahl: i see some similarities in the RNG&#160;;)
 Illedan: ^^
 Illedan: Check of the initial hidden seed :D
 Illedan: But validators are visible in the contribution, so it just makes it little less easy&#160;:(
 Illedan: But harder!
 Illedan: Though a lot of moves to store in the code to beat it
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: With offline that is
 eulerscheZahl: " The game will NOT display all moves separately to save server storage."you are just lazy
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: CG crashed on too many interactions from the viewer
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Illedan: And yeah, lazy
 struct: not if you used custom js
 eulerscheZahl: look at 2048, the replays go for hours
 Illedan: But with disabled UI, the replays go for hours without anything happening
 eulerscheZahl: just write your own serializer+deserializer
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 Illedan: Not in the mood
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just nagging you
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Keep it up, glad to see you around&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i like the game idea. and you always wanted a TSP optim
 eulerscheZahl: search race could be seen as TSP now that I think about it
 eulerscheZahl: (not really, fixed order of checkpoints)
 Illedan: If I made the order of checkpoints visits as you wanted yourself
 eulerscheZahl: next week: search race 2
 struct: whats TSP?
 Illedan: traveling sales person
 eulerscheZahl: travelling salesman problem
 struct: thanks
 Illedan: Ah, that is the full version. With all missing letters in my words. got it
 Illedan: What do you think about the scoring for snake euler?
 Illedan: makes sense with 25000 - steps?
 Illedan: I thought about - steps/25000, but that would give very little changes on faster wins
 eulerscheZahl: sounds reasonable to me
 eulerscheZahl: (your current scoring)
 Illedan:&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: And it will not render all steps with multiple steps.
 Illedan: dbdr, I just changed my hidden seed btw. That is why the amount of food just changed on that one testcase
 dbdr: are you trying to hide the validators?
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Ofc
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L25">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L25</a>
 struct: is it even possible?
 eulerscheZahl: in case you missed it: my seeds aren't chosen randomly at 2048. some seeds cause a long chain until it repeats while others have a much shorter cycle
 struct: you can still see the validators after the game is approved
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 dbdr: you need to be elite to crack it
 Illedan: ^
 Illedan: But I have to do some changes I see. Need more maps with less food
 eulerscheZahl: i'm with struct: you can't really hide it. so give equal changes to everyone - some will play it offline no matter what
 <b>**dbdr stops his 64 GCP instances</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: i think the only way to hide it is either something like number shifting (not suited here) or random validators like bulls and cows (oh god, please no!)
 Illedan: haha, never
 dbdr: how is it hidden in NS? I forgot
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile #de is back to moin
 eulerscheZahl: you have to solve the levels offline to unlock the next level
 eulerscheZahl: SecureRandom and hidden seed (you can't download the code)
 Illedan: There is a secret seed to generate the maps, else everyone could run the generation and reverse it
 eulerscheZahl: so now i'm the only one who can cheat on NS
 dbdr: ah, true, you can disable code download
 eulerscheZahl: usually I hate contributors who disable it
 dbdr: depth 1 =&gt; 1.4k
 derjack: yeah, its like winning clash and not sharing the code
 Illedan: Your AI is done dbdr?
 dbdr: I wouldn't call depth1 done :D
 dtiwari: Hi
 derjack: good afternoon
 Illedan: Do it 20 times and you have depth 20? :D
 dbdr: const DEPTH: usize = 25000;
 dbdr: my job is done here
 BlaiseEbuth: All your depth are belong to us.
 Illedan: I tried to print 25000 steps of going in circles. I timed out just by printing it :P
 eulerscheZahl: is there an output size limit on CG?
 Illedan: oh, nvm
 Illedan: I guess I timed out by creating that string 24999 times with 1 extra char each time
 Illedan: xD
 struct: I think so
 eulerscheZahl: who needs string builders?
 Illedan: shh
 eulerscheZahl: ssh
 dbdr: sss
 BlaiseEbuth: hss
 eulerscheZahl: hhs
 dbdr: GOTO eulerscheZahl@03:32pm
 eulerscheZahl: actually I was referring to the SSH protocol
 BlaiseEbuth: hhh
 dbdr: really? /s
 pyprog: omae wa mou shindiru
 Illedan: I'll add the amount of foods to each testcase. To make it more predictable and divided
 BlaiseEbuth: *shindeiru
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix your romaji
 Beta_Scribbles: heyya guysI am new here
 BlaiseEbuth: *roumaji btw
 BlaiseEbuth: Hello new here, I'm BlaiseEbuth
 dbdr: you won't last long here
 dbdr: too polite
 dbdr: that was for BlaiseEbuthother people are welcome to be polite&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: שם המפורש
 Beta_Scribbles: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Beta_Scribbles: i am enjoying this site so far
 derjack: clashes? or something more
 Beta_Scribbles: yeah. that and the algorithms classes as well
 pyprog: helo helo helo
 Astrobytes: where? Take cover!
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?
 pyprog: :metal_tone1:
 Astrobytes: helo = helicopter
 BlaiseEbuth: Hm...
 pyprog: no i mean hello:joy:
 Illedan: Can I update a contribution with new testcase names? struct?
 Illedan: Not file names, the names inside the files
 struct: not sure
 struct: I guess if its still a demo it should be fine
 Illedan: Ok, I'm sorry to everyone if this crashes CG again
 Illedan: but we will see
 Illedan: Worked
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: dbdr, I changed all testcases
 Illedan: They have number of max food now
 eulerscheZahl: in the past updating a the testcases lead to funny effects
 eulerscheZahl: something caching-related
 BlaiseEbuth: Here Astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://archive.org/details/dongcopterpirate">https://archive.org/details/dongcopterpirate</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: If you're minor, or puritan, don't click. I deny any responsibility if you do.
 Illedan: You are right euler. I used the buffered Group on Vindinium I think
 eulerscheZahl: for vindinium it was still a bit buggy
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil::hear_no_evil::speak_no_evil:
 eulerscheZahl: i later reported bug with it while working on sokoban. got fixed now
 Astrobytes: lol, I don't even have to click on that to recognise it Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: Disclaimer was for others
 eulerscheZahl: i wish i would have read the URL text before clicking
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 <b>**eulerscheZahl sees a link and clicks, ignoring all but the yellow text</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the nice hover effect, great CSS :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: Worked euler.
 Xeylo: uwu
 Illedan: Pushed
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 BlaiseEbuth: So puzzle ready? Can I validate it?
 Illedan: Think so
 BlaiseEbuth: Yea!
 Illedan: Any other objections? dbdr? darkhorse64? Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Seems all good Illedan
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: not sure if we can do it
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Ready.
 BlaiseEbuth: Done.
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan you should not add these to the BufferedGroup<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/ViewController.java#L67">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/ViewController.java#L67</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's a great way to kill your tooltips
 Illedan: ah, true
 Illedan: my bad
 Illedan: thx
 Illedan: fix pushed
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: it's a pain that it stops rendering
 eulerscheZahl: i might code something next week. got a swollen finger&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Pierce it
 BlaiseEbuth: C'mon validate Snake guys, I want to sub my code.
 dbdr: it must be advanced code, right?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: as soon as we get a full animation :imp:
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course. There's a BFS :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: i know, that would cause a lot of headache to change. been there, not recommended
 dbdr: how many points BlaiseEbuth?
 eulerscheZahl: 7
 dbdr: I think it's min 1 per validator, if you crash
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: so 7 is an achivement for sure
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's green when we run into the wall
 Illedan: Sure
 eulerscheZahl: nice, 1 step closer to the language achievement
 BlaiseEbuth: No idea. That's why I want the puzzle to be released: To not have to count them myself.
 dbdr: Submit does that for you
 eulerscheZahl: what's your score on 1 testcase?
 Illedan: 90
 dbdr: 51 points on 1
 Illedan: On 30 I get 22233
 dbdr: I must trap myself but viewer does not want to it
 dbdr: to show it
 eulerscheZahl: fix it Illedan
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Haven't thought to submit... -_-
 dbdr: you must be new here
 Illedan: I guess I can work on it during the weekend. But I can fix that on a submitted contribution
 Illedan: I think
 Illedan: Unless that breaks everything
 Illedan: or only old replays afaik
 BlaiseEbuth: I am dbdr. And I found a bug in Temperature.
 eulerscheZahl: submit? do you mean "test in arena"? you must be old here :D
 eulerscheZahl: will only break old replays
 Illedan: Which is no problem for optims
 eulerscheZahl: but really isn't fun to code
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: I guess I can steal your 2048 thing?
 Illedan: :eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Illedan: :dance:
 eulerscheZahl: basic idea is to serialize the actions (or state) and then deserialize again in JS
 Illedan: But I have to go in 5 min and remodel my kids bedroom tomorrow, so I got that going, which is nice
 eulerscheZahl: then call the SDK functions from JS so you don't have to deal with pixi at least
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl seems to not have played anything but multi since a long time...
 eulerscheZahl: i know that it's still submit for other types than multiplayer games
 eulerscheZahl: still wanted to make a poor joke
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. So you're simply not fun...
 BlaiseEbuth: :rolling_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: of course, i'm German
 Astrobytes: Leave him alone he's German!
 Astrobytes: Dmmit!
 Astrobytes: ffs
 BlaiseEbuth: fss
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. This code is shit.
 Illedan: No other approves? :P 
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: not without thorough testing
 BlaiseEbuth: thoroughgood
 BlaiseEbuth: you're bad to the bone eulerscheZahler
 Astrobytes: b-b-b-b-b-b-bad
 eulerscheZahl: Zahler?
 dbdr: I still need to test the seed stuff
 Astrobytes: yeah, I haven't tested thoroughly enough to approve yet
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't know from where  that come from
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: *Thorogood btw
 eulerscheZahl: did Illedan keep all my seeds or use his own?
 Illedan: Only 1337 is new
 eulerscheZahl: what's the period length of this one?
 BlaiseEbuth: No joke Astrobytes... :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: when does it loop?
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes&lt;&lt;

 Illedan: this is the original
 Illedan: dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: if the loop would have more iterations, you would need the for-switch paradigm
 dbdr: why not:
 Illedan: lol
 dbdr: would be much clearer
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Switched_on_Loops">https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Switched_on_Loops</a>
 dbdr: so we need to reimplement Java's RNG
 dbdr: did you do it?
 Illedan: only for offline sim
 dbdr: if it's any complicated, a simpler one might be nicer. I don't think high randomness matters much
 Illedan: but I can remove it?
 Illedan: I'll fix in 1 hour
 dbdr: you have a offline solver?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you only need the java random for the initial map generation, right?
 dbdr: no, for the next food
 eulerscheZahl: no more deterministic seed?
 dbdr: seed is deterministicyou need to go from seed to x,y of food. that uses Java's builtin RNG
 eulerscheZahl: that's confusing, i think i have to read the code to understand what you are saying
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L114">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L114</a>
 dbdr: if your bot is not in Java, you need to reimeplement java.util.Random
 jacek: is implementation of Random guaranteed across different jvm?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just for the initial setup (snake pos and initial food)
 dbdr: I think so jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: Is anything guarenteed between different jvm?
 eulerscheZahl: everything after is the same way as for 2048
 AllYourTrees: i wish all rngs across languages were consistent given the same seed
 dbdr: oh
 jacek: then they wouldnt be so random eh
 dbdr: right, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L147">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-Snake/blob/CG-Optim/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L147</a>
 dbdr: thanks eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: just FYI Illedan:dreadylein reversed Java random quickly on Number Shifting, so I had to switch to secure random (and clear the leaderboard&#160;:( )
 dbdr: I guess it would be better to use that always, for offline, as Illedan said
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think it matters for you though
 dbdr: I don't understand why the loop iteration direction matters
 dbdr: statistically
 jacek: does it?
 dbdr: if not, why is it there? and comment tries to say something...
 Westicles: My guess is dbdr solves them all in less than 8k steps by monday

 Wontonimo: nice bot sprkrd&#160;!
 sprkrd: thank you :D
 sprkrd: It'll get better
 struct: So many draws I wonder If I should implement what illeda n suggested
 sprkrd: what did he suggest?
 struct: in case of draw the player who had more empty squares in his win, wins
 jacek: but did we reach ceiling yet
 sprkrd: I don't know if I'm convinced by that. I think the reason jacek and I have so many draws is because our bots use an almost identical approach, right now
 jacek: how do you know what approach my bot uses o.O
 sprkrd: minimax vs minimax, no pruning, a decent eval?
 jacek: depends on your definition of minimax, but i use alpha-beta :v
 jacek: pruning
 sprkrd: not much depth at the beginning, 5-6 depth middle game
 sprkrd: alpha beta as well, that's given
 jacek: then we also have similar eval eh
 sprkrd: I'm gonna guess: territory (voronoi-like)?
 jacek: eeyup
 sprkrd: then I feel like we have almost the same thing
 AllYourTrees: j not using a NN for amazons :eyes:
 jacek: not yet. still have local version beating 90% current bot
 Wontonimo: his NN was used to make his bot
 AllYourTrees: oh wow (to both of those things)
 Wontonimo: i'm just joking.  i meant his brain 
 AllYourTrees: oh lol :plane:
 AllYourTrees: ✈
 dbdr: how come you guys use alphabeta in amazons?
 jacek: what would you use
 dbdr: I haven't looked at the game
 jacek: ;s
 dbdr: you usually use MCTS
 sprkrd: I'm working on MCTS now, but it's not trivial to implement for amazons
 sprkrd: the branching factor is huge, the usual fix for that is using move groups
 pyprog: :nerd:
 sprkrd: for amazons there a good heuristic evals, so you'd probably want to include those in your MCTS somehow, either in expansion, in rollouts, or in both
 struct: when you have 1k+ moves in first turn it can be tricky
 sprkrd: anyway, several points where you can introduce bugs :disappointed_relieved:
 sprkrd: with move groups I can do 15K rollouts in 100ms at the beginning, but apparently that's not enough to beat jacek
 sprkrd: so I was trying to incorporate mcts-solver, but since nodes do not alternate between me and my opponent, the logic is a little bit more difficult
 jacek: do not alternate?
 sprkrd: nah, it's 3 nodes for me, 3 nodes for my opponent, and so on
 AllYourTrees: wheres the third come from? 1st is move, 2nd is arrow right?
 sprkrd: in the first node i select my amazon, in the second node I select its destination, and in the third node I select the target of the arrow
 AllYourTrees: ooooh
 jacek: you count queen move and arrow move as different plies?
 sprkrd: 1st = amazon, 2nd = move, 3rd = arrow
 jacek: welp, resubmit time
 sprkrd: OK, I'm gonna take a screenshot while I'm first
 sprkrd: done
 jacek: its photoshopped
 sprkrd: Officially, I've been 1st in a ranking, even if it's been for a few seconds
 sprkrd: photoshopped? really? if I wanted to doctor the results I'd manipulate the DOM of the page :relieved:
 sprkrd: is your new bot your feared NN?
 jacek: you tell me
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571715470">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571715470</a>
 sprkrd: well, there's a funny float number there
 sprkrd: so I'm gonna say yes
 jacek: or its just random
 sprkrd: maybe, but I can take only 1 guess :joy:
 sprkrd: I'm glad I took the screenshot
 sprkrd: I think I can drop amazons already
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571716056">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571716056</a>
 sprkrd: You accomplished my objective on my behalf
 jacek: and eval is 0.99 just before losing :f
 sprkrd: yeah, I saw it
 sprkrd: before you sent the link, apparently there's something funky going on
 sprkrd: but it's either a draw or a win for you, so I think you'll sit comfortably at #1 again
 jacek: at least you can come up with some eval
 jacek: unlike d&amp;b or clobber when it is all or niothing
 sprkrd: indeed
 struct: is this the NN?
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: i made him rage quit&#160;:(
 sprkrd: oh no
 sprkrd: not at all
 sprkrd: I already have my screenshot
 sprkrd: I'd like to see my MCTS-solver approach working also
 sprkrd: at the moment it does funky stuff
 jacek: would solver work much better here? it seems there is no end until the very end
 sprkrd: from what I could see, it detects defeats fairly early, practically as early as minimax
 sprkrd: for some reason, however, it does not have an easy time with victories, tho
 jacek: so it just avoid traps
 struct: I think its similar on bt
 struct: solver doesnt add much
 sprkrd: for the moment yes, but I have yet to see once I solve the problem with victories
 struct: even when solve 10+ turns before ending
 sprkrd: there is a bug somewhere, because it only sees victories 1 step ahead
 sprkrd: i'd expect it to see a little bit earlier, specially when the board is already pretty filled up
 sprkrd: to see it*
 MSmits: sprkrd mcts solver isnt going to be hard because of the alternating. It's going to be hard because there's no way to benefit from the move groups. You'll still need to solve every move if you want to prove a win for the parent
 MSmits: or a draw
 MSmits: so the full branching
 sprkrd: i don't mean hard for the algorithm
 sprkrd: i mean hard for me to implement
 MSmits: ah you mean hard to code
 MSmits: it's a bit messy yeah
 MSmits: should be doable though
 sprkrd: yup
 sprkrd: yeah, i got it working somewhat
 sprkrd: but still something smells funny
 MSmits: it's hard in D&amp;B as well because of multiple moves per turn
 MSmits: per ply i mean
 sprkrd: remind me again, which one is D&amp;B?
 MSmits: dots and boxes
 sprkrd: I'm so bad with acronyms
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes</a>
 jacek: drum&amp;beats
 MSmits: I think it's bass
 MSmits: but sure :P
 sprkrd: Haven't tried that one yet. Probably in 6 months or so when I'm satisfied with Amazons :joy:
 MSmits: yeah there's tons i havent tried. I get too obsessed by a single multi
 jacek: amazons? that tutorial game?
 struct: I should have released the 16x16 version
 jacek: its even easier than onitama ~
 MSmits: onitama is not easy
 MSmits: for a board game
 struct: The hardest part of breakthrough was parsing inputs
 MSmits: breakthrough is pretty easy to code, just not to eval 
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: checkers is hard
 struct: I think i finally found something on eval
 jacek: psqt?
 MSmits: cool
 struct: whats psqt?
 sprkrd: i want to reply to you with something witty, but I really cannot think of anything. So at least know I tried
 MSmits: :trophy:
 MSmits: for participation
 sprkrd: thank you, thank you
 jacek: piece square tables
 struct: nah
 struct: dont have that
 jacek: do you have at least row-based score?
 jacek: home row is somewhat important for example
 MSmits: if you have column values and row values and you combine them in your eval, it's kinda like psqt right?
 struct: yes but very simple
 struct: i eval home row as the lowest :D
 jacek: oO
 struct: home row as almost no value for my bot
 MSmits: home row should be higher than the next row
 struct: has*
 MSmits: and not just the whole row
 MSmits: some pieces on the home row are more important than others
 jacek: well corners are less
 struct: im rewriting the bot
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/szmkGuB.png">https://i.imgur.com/szmkGuB.png</a>
 struct: So it knows this position is solved
 MSmits: my problem with this is that if you have all these parameters, you need to fit them and if you're doing that, you might as well go NN
 MSmits: just take marchete's thingy
 MSmits: adapt it
 struct: dont think its that easy
 struct: But I havent checked it yet
 MSmits: seems easy enough to use on oware at least
 struct: I still need to finish the book
 MSmits: everyone and their mom is doing it
 MSmits: I think you can plug in a different game by just changing the inputs 
 MSmits: and sim
 MSmits: it wont beat the top 3 probably
 jacek: youre booking?
 struct: Still I want to learn how to do it
 MSmits: NN book jacek
 struct: no jacek i meant finish reading the nn book
 jacek: oh
 jacek: cg spoiled me
 MSmits: how os
 MSmits: so
 martinpapa69: imo the easiest way to learn NN is doing it
 jacek: or twisted? :thinking:
 MSmits: martinpapa69 the book helps you do it
 MSmits: it's code you can just test and use
 MSmits: not just theory
 struct: sure maybe I can use Marchete code and apply it, but will I understand how it works?
 jacek: there are some many resources on NNs but mostly theory and math. until i wrote one, i didn't know what to do with them
 martinpapa69: Marchete basically provided a complete code. you will learn nothing by running his train.py script and submitting it
 MSmits: I think I know enough to use marchetes thingy and its high on my list, but there's mikla to beat&#160;:(
 jacek: :bacon:
 MSmits: yes, the bacon
 MSmits: martinpapa69 when i say use, I mean adapt to my own purposes
 martinpapa69: but there is so much knowledge in the field of neural networks. and you dont need actually much to build one
 MSmits: I still have a lot of data to use in supervised learning for oware
 MSmits: i'd just be using his NN inferer
 MSmits: and maybe parts of the training pipeline
 Illedan: dbdr, I'll try to optimize this viewer
 martinpapa69: he shared a lot of cool stuff other than the inference
 MSmits: yes i know, but i dont want to make another azero
 MSmits: I am trying to make it learn from perfect data, not selfplay
 Illedan: You say it like it is easy :P
 MSmits: it is easy if you copy marchetes work
 Illedan: Play snake now .)
 jacek: he'll get blind
 sprkrd: :smirk:
 MSmits: when I use templates, my VS tells me: "well if you're gonna be that way, no intellisense for you"
 seshoumara: hi everyone, I'm back after a long time, 2 years or so
 MSmits: welcome back
 sprkrd: I use vim with no plugins, so I'm quite used to the absence of intelligence
 MSmits: I see
 jacek: and you have not quitted ever since
 sprkrd: not IDE have convinced me yet, unfortunately
 seshoumara: @MSmits thanks
 sprkrd: too much bloat for my taste
 MSmits: bloat?
 sprkrd: yeah, too many features
 MSmits: ah, I just ignore most of them
 jacek: he programs with punch cards
 sprkrd: and sometimes a noticeable slowdown
 sprkrd: jacek I actually think I belong to that era
 MSmits: VS is quite good, but yeah other IDE's I mostly hate. I'd prefer plain text to those
 MSmits: sometimes i dont like VS
 MSmits: mostly when it's telling me how to code
 sprkrd: I've heard good things of the profiler
 struct: VS tells you how to code?
 MSmits: "you really ought to make this readonly"
 martinpapa69: especially when you code in c#. pretty annoying
 MSmits: yes
 struct: ah for C#
 MSmits: C#
 MSmits: profiler is cool sprkrd
 MSmits: mostly it works well. But for a massively recursive algorithm I dont know how to interpret it
 sprkrd: If I ever program something in Windows, I think I'd like to try VS just for the profiler
 sprkrd: and in the absence of valgrind, of course
 martinpapa69: if you go vs you never go back
 sprkrd: :joy:
 MSmits: like my nimsolver. a function will run itself 5 times and it will use 80% 60% and 30% of calc time. Ehhh... that doesnt add up to 100%
 martinpapa69: ye i like how percentes just disappaer in the profiler
 martinpapa69: 30+60 = 100
 MSmits: oh, right
 MSmits: but on recursion its worse i tell you
 martinpapa69: never tried profiling recursion
 MSmits: well if you do a minimax for example, you'd have to
 MSmits: pretty common
 MSmits: or dfs
 jacek: just stack it up
 MSmits: :confused:
 eulerscheZahl: "if you go vs you never go back"I ditched VS for MonoDevelop while dumping my Windows
 eulerscheZahl: that was in 2014 I think
 MSmits: and you still miss it
 eulerscheZahl: much less now that I have VS Code
 eulerscheZahl: except for the profiler
 MSmits: yeah vs code is kind of ok 
 eulerscheZahl: haven't found anything close to VS profiler
 MSmits: I used it sometimes to read those CG referees
 martinpapa69: vs code if pretty good for go, and for rust as i heard. but for c++..mehh
 MSmits: yeah it sucked, the one time i tried to use it for c++
 MSmits: was for hypersonic, had to use gcc only types (128 bit) and VS wouldnt have it
 MSmits: at least VS code would have (half the time) some intellisense
 MSmits: but it crashed often for some reason
 martinpapa69: ye intellisense is rly weird
 martinpapa69: in vs..its just too clean
 MSmits: i couldnt code that well back then. If i were to repeat this I'd just code my only 128 bit type and use VS
 MSmits: my own
 MSmits: too clean?
 martinpapa69: like, works perfectly
 MSmits: ah, mostly yes
 MSmits: sometimes i make it crash though
 MSmits: with C++
 MSmits: well it doesnt exactly crash VS, it will just no longer see error
 MSmits: usually with really big files
 MSmits: 2k-3k lines
 MSmits: especially with templates
 sprkrd: oh will you look at that, another spaniard
 sprkrd: it's absolutely disgusting, the worst kind of people
 jacek: budapest in spain? :thinking:
 sprkrd: :grimacing:
 martinpapa69: pretty cool place
 MSmits: a fellow covid red zone country 
 martinpapa69: I couldnt register to the private contest, so i had to move
 MSmits: thats the spirit
 struct: which contest?
 MSmits: you just moved the whole city of budapest to Spain
 MSmits: sponsored contest struct
 struct: The one with 3 pods?
 MSmits: Protugal isnt in
 MSmits: but
 MSmits: you can move Leiria to Spain as well
 jacek: it had HS in screenshot
 MSmits: It's a pretty big country
 sprkrd: so... which one is it? bulgary or spain? :joy:
 MSmits: jacek i've often seen that picture for contests
 MSmits: it's never actually HS afaik
 struct: I need to finish bt anyways
 sprkrd: hungary, sorry*
 sprkrd: got my cities mixed up
 seshoumara: how does quest map work? It detects automatically if the conditions are met for that node, or it trusts me I've done it?
 struct: im still trying to code the win check
 MSmits: detects seshoumara
 MSmits: wincheck&gt;
 MSmits: that seems pretty basic
 struct: from the 6th row
 MSmits: hmm, does this wincheck include cooperation between your pieces?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: ah ok, i have a  1 piece race lookup
 MSmits: from row 5
 MSmits: so on opponent side
 MSmits: it takes 1 piece of yours and all pieces of opponent
 struct: yeah I was trying to do this with lookup table
 MSmits: but my pieces cant cooperate
 MSmits: the information you need is in how many turns you can force the win
 MSmits: because the opponent could also be forcing the win
 struct: well it wont get to that point
 struct: because solver wont allow it
 MSmits: why not
 struct: i make a move if opponent cant stop it i win
 MSmits: unless you cant stop him from winning sooner
 MSmits: what if he has a 1 piece situation on 5th row
 MSmits: and is faster than your 2 piece on 6th
 MSmits: 2 pieces take more time to move
 struct: dont think it can happen
 struct: no
 struct: because he must capture the piece that moves to 7th row
 struct: or he will lose by 1 tempo
 MSmits: ok, but you lose time to move it to 7th row
 jacek: so many ifs
 MSmits: and then you need to move the other one
 MSmits: takes 3 turns to win
 MSmits: oh right he took 1 then
 MSmits: so net 2
 MSmits: good point
 MSmits: yeah this could work
 MSmits: do you do a triangular PEXT lookup in front of anything that moves to 6th?
 MSmits: should be 3^9th possibilties
 MSmits: not that bad of a lookup
 seshoumara: I'm lvl 21, 1K XP, how does that compare now?
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: not sure seshoumara
 MSmits: you need 30 for full powers I think
 Marchete: about BT, have you seen that paper about Race Patterns, struct?
 Marchete: that doesn't solve some endgames?
 jacek: the one when you need pay for
 MSmits: nah that one is free
 Marchete: that's free
 jacek: oh
 Marchete: the damn paper behind a paywall it's an NN model for Dots and Boxes...
 MSmits: reading that paper, it did not seem like a huge success to me. A lot of caveats
 Marchete: well, model
 jacek: link?
 MSmits: whats it called?
 Marchete: some input definition
 sprkrd: which one is behind a paywall?
 struct: no marchete
 jacek:&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.2676&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.2676&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7317912">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7317912</a>
 MSmits: Marchete in my experience a lot of this stuff is not suitable for larger D&amp;B sizes. Usually it's 5x5 or smaller
 MSmits: the game becomes different at larger sizes
 struct: thanks Ill check it
 MSmits: way more opportunity for complex structures
 sprkrd: Marchete do you have it already?
 sprkrd: (the paper)
 Marchete: you barely know about D&amp;B... :rofl:
 sprkrd: I don't
 Marchete: just kidding :P
 Marchete: I was talking to Smits
 sprkrd: I was asking if I could get the paper for you
 Marchete: he barely knows it
 sprkrd: In case you don't have it
 MSmits: lol
 sprkrd: Ah, ok
 sprkrd: :joy:
 Marchete: I don't have the paper
 Marchete: I've read the abstract and seen some images
 sprkrd: OK, I can get it for you, I think I have access
 Marchete: it seems similar to some ideas I had
 Marchete: for free?
 Marchete: it's freeeeee
 sprkrd: I won't charge you anything, no :joy:
 jacek: sci hub?
 sprkrd: no
 sprkrd: I have legit access
 sprkrd: through the university
 Marchete: :hugging:
 Marchete: My google fu were useless
 Marchete: no way to get it
 Marchete: neither there or in related conferences

 Marchete: :O
 NOT1: i am noob )
 sprkrd: Maybe I should upload it to Drive so the link is persistent
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: better no
 MSmits: probably not
 Marchete: I imagine you shouldn't
 MSmits: it's a violation of some terms somewhere
 MSmits: even sharing it here
 MSmits: but should be ok i guess
 sprkrd: thank you for your concern for me :cry:
 sprkrd: anyway, I think only a few of you were looking for that paper, so I think it's alright already
 MSmits: yeah technically i am a student at my university for like another month
 MSmits: so i should have access myself if i figure out how
 sprkrd: if you're a teacher probably you should have access also after that month
 MSmits: mmh not automatically
 MSmits: universities do
 MSmits: but high schools, doubtful
 MSmits: i could probably arrange it though, with some effort
 sprkrd: ah, i see, I thought you were teaching at university
 MSmits: no, I teach physics/CS to 16-18 yr olds
 jacek: and not fair for those who pay for the papers
 jacek: oops scroll
 MSmits: coming schoolyear just CS
 sprkrd: who pays for the papers?
 MSmits: i was at university to get a teachign degree for that
 Marchete: papers should be free, or at least $$ for researchers
 sprkrd: it's a stinking business, it's what it is
 Marchete: indeed
 sprkrd: IEEE it's not going bankrupt anytime soon
 MSmits: :poop:
 sprkrd: you know how much they make in entrance fees for each conference?
 MSmits: at least part of the money should go somewhere other than IEEE shouldnt it? Like the universities?
 Marchete: sprkd you are from now on on a research for a novel D&amp;B strategy
 Marchete: so it's OK to share with me :D
 sprkrd: they brought the freaking cirque du soleil to the last one I attended to, for chris sake
 MSmits: yes we will conscript you
 Marchete: there I have your back
 sprkrd: :joy:
 MSmits: Marchete it does seem very similar to what you do
 MSmits: with the graphs
 MSmits: I doubt its usefulness for 7x7 though
 sprkrd: OK, next one after amazons, it's D&amp;B
 MSmits: only do it if you enjoy the math, or if you're just looking to make a quick working bot. Getting top 20 is not so hard
 Marchete: yeah, I have the same ideas but I don't ask for my ideas 40$
 Marchete: D&amp;B is a different game, and imo hard
 sprkrd: I enjoy difficult math problems
 Marchete: hard to master*
 MSmits: then you'll like it
 sprkrd: more than bruteforcing games with raw speed
 sprkrd: (which I also enjoy, but slightly less)
 MSmits: If I converted my bot to python, I'd still beat everyone other than mikla :P
 MSmits: bruteforcing is only useful here when you and your opponent are using all the same tricks
 MSmits: but if you're using only 1 more math-trick your opponent isnt using, then you can beat him with python
 Marchete: domain knowledge plz, not trick
 MSmits: sure sure
 MSmits: but so much typing
 sprkrd: let's not get carried away, never will I ever participate with python :joy:
 MSmits: just mentioning that to get the idea across how important math is here&#160;:)
 MSmits: dont actually use python ofc
 sprkrd: i guess at the top 5 or top 10 speed becomes important again
 sprkrd: OK, you got my interest, I'm going to read what D&amp;B is all about
 sprkrd: although I really really don't want to open another watermelon before I'm satisfied with amazons
 Marchete: "The input [...]contains 25 elements: the number of chains of the first 11 typesshown in table I, the number of loops with different lengthand the number of nodes with different valence."
 MSmits: sprkrd currently the 1 and 2 and 3 are so far apart, speed doesnt matter
 Marchete: very simplified, but similar to my idea, do you see Smits?
 MSmits: well for 1 and 2 maybe
 MSmits: yeah i saw that
 MSmits: thats why i said it's similar
 Marchete: Maybe I can win you with NN
 Marchete: :slight_smile:
 MSmits: I dont believe it if it is just with NN, but NN + math. sure I believe that
 struct: I think re curse tried NN
 struct: But im not sure
 MSmits: very briefly
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: he quickly saw other low hanging fruit
 MSmits: like othello
 Marchete: I prefer low player games
 MSmits: why?
 struct: board games
 Marchete: oware is like a f*cking subway now :D
 Marchete: I play static
 MSmits: is it really?
 Marchete: I don't want rock paper scissors
 Marchete: and retake it each day
 MSmits: only 219 players
 struct: only 218 on bt
 MSmits: but you mean the active top 10 i guess
 jacek: amazons has low player count
 jacek: [solved]
 MSmits: so basically you dont mean low player games, but stale games 
 MSmits: where people have moved on and left their bots behind
 MSmits: to serve as benchmarks
 Marchete: stale, yes
 Marchete: I play them as puzzles
 MSmits: yes, I dont mind that either
 MSmits: it's not like it's not a challenge
 Marchete: to test stuff and take my time
 Marchete: an optimization game
 MSmits: still hard to beat year old bots. It's not like they got weaker in the meantime
 Marchete: also many of these games are gems
 Marchete: and few people played it
 Marchete: meanwhile CSB, UTTT are crowded, dunno why
 struct: less leagues
 struct: no exp
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:&#160;?
 MSmits: csb because of tutorial
 martinpapa69: and because of MadKnight ofc
 MSmits: and uttt because people know TTT and it's easy. Also the player amount makes it seem more attractive to some
 sprkrd: gonna leave now, see you later ^^
 jacek: who?
 MSmits: bye
 jacek: finally beat oware lb
 jacek: this time i used win/lose values from selfplay of my best model
 Marchete: hmm I think the guys at the paper I was looking for are these:
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://dotsandboxes.tar.xyz/">http://dotsandboxes.tar.xyz/</a>
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/yimmon/dots-and-boxes">https://github.com/yimmon/dots-and-boxes</a>
 Marchete: same name
 martinpapa69: nothing works better for me than selfplay training
 Marchete: yimmon.zhuang
 Marchete: like what else martinpapa69?
 martinpapa69: i tried some rly complicated stuff. maintaning a local leaderboard of my models with TrueSkill system. and picking models from the top to generate samples
 martinpapa69: same result as selfplay
 Marchete: same results than always last model?
 Marchete: then maybe you need to try more sample pool
 Marchete: jace_k and Robo have much much more
 Marchete: but then you might need to change some parts
 martinpapa69: same result as the best version of the selfplay-model history. the most recent model is not always the best. but i just stick with the selfplay trainign for now and try other stuff. might move to other game
 martinpapa69: always wanted to make a decent bot for ghost in the cell. dont think there are many nn bots there
 struct: just wait until I finish porting ultimate d&amp;b
 struct: I dont think there is any NN gitc bot
 martinpapa69: don't know if i have to rebuild the 2d map, or is there easier way to input it to the nn
 Marchete: gitc nn?
 Marchete: that's madness
 struct: I would try bt
 struct: its a fun game
 Marchete: there are many others to test
 Marchete: BT, C4, etc etvc
 struct: and easy to see if bot is playing well or not
 Marchete: indeed
 Marchete: gitc? it's a very mathematical game
 jacek: checkers *.*
 Marchete: any board game
 Marchete: without hundreds of units
 struct: without multiple moves
 struct: *outputs
 jacek: othelo can has multiple moves&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I can haz cheezburger
 Illedan: Snake might break now. I'm trying to enable the viewer again 
 jacek: oware is fast because you have 14 active inputs. then comes checkers with 32
 jacek: bt would be 64
 struct: or you can try chess&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: implementing chess sim sounds like a nightmare
 jacek: rebless is working on the bot :scream:
 Astrobytes: "the bot"&#160;?
 jacek: :cheese: 960
 struct: chess nN bot
 jacek: he cant beat the one trained on ccrl games
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, it's regular chess currently though isn't it
 jacek: he knows standard chess so he knows when the bot fails
 Astrobytes: very cool project
 jacek: im chess noob. actually im noob at most games
 Illedan: dbdr?
 jacek: the bots i make would crush me even within cg constrains
 dbdr: Illedan?
 Illedan: Updated Snake
 Illedan: Viewer should be better
 Illedan: Always on
 Astrobytes: No one said you had to be good at them jacek&#160;:)
 Illedan: never disabled
 Astrobytes: Oh it updates all the time now
 dbdr: The game has crashed. Please contact the author and enclose the following error:
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 dbdr: 511 frames
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeahh, you can be bad jacek
 Illedan: How many moves a turn?
 Astrobytes: didn't you use eulers 2048 code?
 struct: Maybe he has like 200 moves per turn
 Illedan: I tried it without first
 dbdr: 20moves / turn I think
 struct: ok so the contraint is 10k
 struct: i thought it was 100k
 Illedan: The snake has a lot of parts
 struct: Illedan upload hacked sdk
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct: and remove that constraint 
 struct: ezpz
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: I guess I can do 200 frames all every game?
 Illedan: :thinking:
 dbdr: I try refreshing the IDE
 Illedan: Crashes for me too
 Illedan: I'll render 200 frames only
 Illedan: should be enough
 dbdr: yes
 Illedan: I do 500 moves every frame
 Illedan: So I only need 50 frames xD
 dbdr: nice
 dbdr: did you hardcode some patterns?
 dbdr: 500 moves is a lot of depth
 struct: hmm i dont get the viewer data error
 Illedan: Should I update the random generation? Or is it ok that the initial creation is based on Java rnd?
 struct: puts "SENW"*100000
 Illedan: Try again now dbdr, it is updated
 struct: doesnt break the game
 dbdr: if it's easy to replace, it would be simpler to have the same rng for everything
 Illedan: Sure, gimme 2 min
 dbdr: if it's hard, don't worry, those who need will figure it out&#160;:)
 dbdr: I had 600 frames without crash
 dbdr: ah, but it stops moving again
 Illedan: After 200 frames yeah..
 Illedan: You want to view the result when you lose too?
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: ah, you could do only that frame?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: 200 + the last one
 dbdr: nice
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: crashed on 191
 jacek: bazinga
 Illedan: 150 now
 struct: Illedan when a piece is eaten do you remove it or move it?
 Illedan: Just hide it
 struct: in the graphics
 struct: I think move can help
 struct: you can make it instant
 Illedan: I create it the first time it will show on a tile
 struct: Ah I see
 Illedan: Try now dbdr
 dbdr: last 3 frames are shown (out of 600)
 dbdr: nice
 dbdr: but not when I crash&#160;:(
 Marchete: Msmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571753453">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571753453</a>
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: why you were sad and then happy?
 dbdr: looks like a bug
 Illedan: ah, true. I need to mark you as dead first
 Illedan: Fixed dbdr
 dbdr: yes, it shows the last frame in case of crash
 Illedan: I can do 1500 moves for 10 rounds and then 1 the rest of the game with a viewer&#160;:)
 Illedan: Approve? :D
 Illedan: Ok, pushed the seed thing now too. Had forgotten
 Illedan: *pushed to github
 Westicles: ah, integer scores now.  that seems better
 Illedan: Yeah
 Westicles: Any idea what the bests are going to end up being?  Like 5k steps?
 Westicles: Going to be tough to anneal.  Any change in the middle kills all the rest of the move list
 Illedan: No idea
 Illedan: Depends on the food amount
 linjoehan: this is a test
 Astrobytes: FAILED
 MSmits: Marchete
 MSmits: that replay you shared
 MSmits: first I was sad because i lost the nim game
 MSmits: then I was happy because you made a mistake and i won the nim game again
 MSmits: then i lost on score. Winning the nim game is not a guarantee you win on score
 MSmits: especially if you sacrifice boxes to get there
 MSmits: that ridiculous amount of loops though
 MSmits: thats what won you the game
 MSmits: I still need to extend my score solver till before the endgame with some negamax. It's on my list, but did not get around to it as it's not what loses me games vs mikla
 MSmits: at endgame it takes me roughly 80 microseconds to solve the game, so i can do it like 100  times. Solve maybe 2 turns sooner
 MSmits: also on a map like the one you showed me, it's less than 1 microsecond to solve
 MSmits: very simple
 Liquidor: Hi everyone 👋
 Astrobytes: Solving in μs is the way forward
 MSmits: hehe, just endgames though, where there are no safe moves left. Some of them are so simple, you can do them in your head
 pinao: hi
 Wontonimo: welcome pinao , what brought you here to Codingame&#160;?
 Wontonimo: Hi Liquidor, what are you working on?
 Wontonimo: I've been trying to improve my Ultimate Tic Tac Toe bot in prep for Connect 4
 MSmits: need any tips before I go to sleep Wontonimo
 MSmits: what are you trying?
 Wontonimo: how do i get my team members to not turn everything into bad news?  I'm been trying beer.
 MSmits: lol
 Wontonimo: perhaps though, i should administer it to them
 MSmits: perhaps&#160;:)
 MSmits: :beer:
 MSmits: :beers:
 Wontonimo: but that would be less for me
 Wontonimo: cheers Msmit, have a great night
 MSmits: gn!
 struct: for  connect 4 i recommend implementing this
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/09-anticipate-losing-moves/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/09-anticipate-losing-moves/</a>
 struct: Then port it from scalar to avx
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: Thanks!
 struct: its a bit more tricky for 9x7
 Wontonimo: only slightly.  after you told me yours was 64bit, i puzzled over it and realized that after figuring it out it seems so obvious
 Wontonimo: but, i haven't *actually* coded it yet, just pseudo code in my NN
 Wontonimo: I really like the mechanic in connect 4 where the second person can take the first persons move.  It really encourages a fair first move even in the most unfair starting boards.
 Wontonimo: i think this is a mechanic we should encourage in future games
 struct: it makes sense in unbalanced games
 Wontonimo: it would really improve UTTT
 struct: I implemented it on yavalath due to suggestions
 Wontonimo: +100
 struct: The game is solved if you play middle
 struct: I think msmits solved for middle and cells around middle
 struct: also I think that 2 games is important
 struct: The problem is that 2 games in same replay is not equal to two games in  different replays in terms of ranking
 reCurse: It's lazy design :P
 Wontonimo: first time i saw 2 games in 1 replay I thought it was a nice work around
 reCurse: Sorry I meant the pie rule
 Wontonimo: i get my kids to use the pie rule for dividing chores.  One of them divides them, the other picks the group they want.
 Wontonimo: it's a wonderful mechanic
 reCurse: It's fine for kids yeah
 reCurse: But it's lazy game design
 Wontonimo: i had it in my business contract for my last business as a way of buying out the partner in the event of the need for such things.  I've heard it called the shotgun clause 
 Wontonimo: There are variants of it where there one person can pay the other to make the cut
 Wontonimo: in an escalating fashion
 reCurse: Sure I'm not saying it's a bad idea in general
 Wontonimo: oh, i was just babbling
 reCurse: But for game design it's basically the designer throwing his/her/its hands in the air and giving up, basically telling the player to figure it out and it's not his/her/its job
 Wontonimo: i didn't think it was an argument
 Wontonimo: LazyMammal and I made a game together for a gamejam where the core mechanic was just such pie cutting.  You had to bet which tower was going to win in a simulation with canons and such
 Wontonimo: you could either accept the simulation, or pay the other player to swap sides.  They could then do the same with an ever increasing payment
 Wontonimo: winner gets X virtual tacos for winning
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: :taco:
 Wontonimo: i mean dollars
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: :o
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Sadge
 Wontonimo: thanks for the :taco: MaliciouslyCrypticUsername
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: np!
 Wontonimo: the game wasn't a hit or anything, and i think 3 who people played it.
 reCurse: Why are chess endgame tables so complicated :scream:
 struct: they are scary
 struct: how well does your current bot play endgames?
 struct: I know some NNs used to struggle a bit on end games
 reCurse: Saw a game where it drew a KRvK endgame
 reCurse: Which prompted me to look this up
 reCurse: I may also have watched an hour or two of 1sec/move games between 2 different nets
 Wontonimo: i've never coded an endgame table
 reCurse: It's very interesting
 reCurse: Like instead of defending a threatened piece they almost always do a counterattack instead
 reCurse: Sometimes I have to double-take and do tactics myself to convince it's actually an even trade and not just sacing
 struct: you trained based on top ais games right?
 reCurse: No I'm on self-play now
 reCurse: I'm very pleased to see it play openings properly now
 struct: nice
 reCurse: It's playing in a way I haven't seen before
 reCurse: Endgames suck though
 reCurse: Failing to draw a KRvK basically not only eats tons of training time for no reason, but it also screws up the value of the game
 reCurse: Err failing to win
 reCurse: So I'm stuck between implementing EGTB lookup myself (ugh), reusing existing code (ugh) or live with it (ugh)
 struct: endgame net
 struct: :D
 reCurse: Seems pointless
 reCurse: I don't need a NN to win a KRvK
 reCurse: It's a waste of everything
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lichess.org/study/kPWZgp6s">https://lichess.org/study/kPWZgp6s</a>
 struct: look here
 struct: lc0 cant win with KQvsK
 reCurse: Sounds familiar...
 reCurse: Don't know what to do&#160;:/
 reCurse: Even if I use an EGTB I can end up overtraining on endgames due to the sheer amount of moves to mate
 Wontonimo: if you have space (which you eluded to in a previous chat), have 2 nets and switch to the end game one once there are less than X pieces left
 reCurse: Oh I don't care about CG
 Wontonimo:&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: lol
 reCurse: I'm still aiming for small sizes because that's the angle I like
 reCurse: Fast training, fast search, already have the expertise etc
 reCurse: And that way I have my own little corner eh
 reCurse: No one cares about 1sec/move chess :P
 reCurse: Well I guess for now the easiest is to rip off some probing code and keep 1 net
 reCurse: I already have huge games that probably mess up the training anyway
 reCurse: 300+ moves
 reCurse: Figure I could double my training speed too
 Wontonimo: you can mitigate overtraining on common or known scenarios by using "the biggest loser" loss filter trick
 reCurse:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i sent you the link
 reCurse: Oh isn't that like importance sampling
 Wontonimo: it seems counter intuitive that dropping 75% or more of your backprop would actually help, but it does, and by a large amount
 reCurse: Hmm ok so not the same thing
 reCurse: I'll check that more in details later thanks
 reCurse: Though I'm more concerned about the data being overly skewed towards those endgames
 reCurse: Maybe I can just arbitrarily weigh down the gradient of any move generated from an EGTB
 Wontonimo: there's another concept of making multiple subnetworks, and then a controller that chooses the subnetwork.  To encourage
 Wontonimo: the system to not just pick one always, there is a fatigue mechanic applied to the choice of subnetwork
 Wontonimo: this encourages specialization and discrimination 
 reCurse: Hmm
 Wontonimo: if you had 2, it may (or may not) just naturally divide it's learning between mid game and end game
 Wontonimo: but more likely it will divide it by something else that maximizes its change for success
 Wontonimo: that it's obvious to us
 Wontonimo: these are all heavy weight network designs with many more layers
 Wontonimo: which, considering you said you are going to speed, this may not be a good path
 struct: I think the speed is related to 300+ moves games
 reCurse: Yeah it's interesting but probably overkill for me
 Wontonimo: "the biggest loser" opti for training i think is still worthy of investigation
 reCurse: Ok
 Hackercodehp: Hello world
 Wontonimo: hello Hackercodehp programmer
 Wontonimo: most of us who are online now spend a lot of time playing bot battles (not clash of code)
 Wontonimo: come join is
 Wontonimo: *us
 Wontonimo: if there was an intro bot battle, it would be <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 Hackercodehp: sure
 Wontonimo: let me know if you need any help getting started
 Hackercodehp: s Iam new to bot programming friend.
 Wontonimo: so, the idea is that you control one bot and when you submit your code it will battle someone else who has written a bot
 Wontonimo: i'll PM / DM you and tell you more
 Hackercodehp: Thank you Wontonimo

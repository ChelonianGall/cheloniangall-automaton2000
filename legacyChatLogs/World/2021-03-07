 Kokoz: hello all&#160;:)Anyone good with python? I have a question
 acuto: hey
 baguettes: Kokoz, don't ask to ask
 baguettes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dontasktoask.com/">https://dontasktoask.com/</a>
 Kokoz: it is more complicated and I dont want to flood this chat..
 jacek: multiple lines will be automatically pastebined
 acuto: any laravel expert?
 Bickio: I know python (perhaps expert? idk) fire away
 Dan4Life: Hi
 Dan4Life: just wanted to say that
 Dan4Life: for no reason whatsoever
 derjack: oh my
 Reaper_for_you: i thought i knew it,looks like i do not
 derjack: hm?
 mangoorange08: i thought im doing great in coding but when I tried this clash of code, I figured that I was noob&#160;:&lt;
 derjack: try some easy puzzles
 derjack: youll be more noob than ever before
 ngdangtu: Does anyone understand wtf counting around the circle is?
 Passifi: Coding is there to break your Ego if you want to keep it intact try doing Feminist Dance Therapy instead
 ngdangtu: ' The answer has to do with the total count of circles in each number. '
 derjack: 8 has 2 circles, 0 has 1 circle
 ngdangtu: I have no ideal what circles is in this math -_-
 B365564984: hi guys, is there any javascript framework/library support to build a chatbot?
 ngdangtu: And here is the answer: print(s.count('6') + s.count('9') + s.count('0') + s.count('8') * 2)
 Passifi: 6 has a circle 9 has one 8 has 2 and 0 has 1
 Passifi: its the shape of the digits
 Passifi: its not really a circle so my inner autists understands your pain
 ngdangtu: Do you have document about this? I couldn't google anything from the problem.
 ngdangtu: Wasting 15' and gain nothing -_-
 Passifi: I don't think this is a common way to talk about the digits thats why you don't find anything its more of a language barrier I suppose it hasn't really got anything to do with math
 B365564984: if the problem isnt solved, you still learn something
 Passifi: eight is two circle o o stacked on top of each other try thinking about that&#160;:)
 ngdangtu: And I still try to google with the left results of other players. 
 ngdangtu: Ok, finally got. It is not a math problem.
 derjack: well if you use roman numbers every day you may not understand it
 derjack: :v
 ngdangtu: @derjack , I totally agree with you.
 ngdangtu: Perhaps I have been too insensitive about familiar things around me
 ngdangtu: What a bad science attitude&#160;:))
 Passifi: Nah your mind just got stuck on something and then it couldn't break free its the human condition&#160;:)
 ngdangtu: Do you have any advice on this case? 
 Passifi: Try reading Zen and the Art of motorcycle maintenance it applies here wonderfully&#160;:) Getting your mind unstuck is a rather ardous process, tho, I am afraid. So no quick fixes for that. 
 derjack: or acid
 Passifi: that might help too or it might get you on Joe Rogans Podcast 
 ngdangtu: @derjack where do you want me to pour it onto?
 derjack: brain
 ngdangtu: You mean yours? Sure, open it
 Dan4Life: I hate C++ when it comes to shortest mode
 Dan4Life: Anyone else?
 ngdangtu: or PHP
 derjack: then dont use c++ for shortest mode
 ngdangtu: I used Js.
 ngdangtu: But I think that's unfair to compare C++/PHP to Py or Js
 Dan4Life: derjak you have a point
 Dan4Life:  but like im still going to use c++ nonetheless, at least until im good at python
 ngdangtu: I wonder how many languages a normal dev would have&#160;:?
 Dan4Life: all the rank from fastest just to reduce cuz of shortest lol
 Dan4Life: Just a suggestion: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/586291a9-1b14-4f3f-9a95-734afdbe4740">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/586291a9-1b14-4f3f-9a95-734afdbe4740</a>
 Dan4Life: dont know why its in pastebin
 Dan4Life: *divide the clash of code
 derjack: codingame is not only about the clashes
 Dan4Life: *divide the clash of code
 baguettes: That doesn't look like a good suggestion
 baguettes: Clash of code is only possible if all of them do the same mod
 baguettes: mode*
 Dan4Life: like i mean something like this:before entering a clash, pick the mode you want to play, or pick random, then you will play with others that are also playing that mode
 Dan4Life: just curious
 Dan4Life: is there a link showing how clash of code points work
 Dan4Life: cuz i think there is a points decay(?) system
 derjack: its trueskill algorithm
 derjack: and for clashes points decay over time
 Dan4Life: oh
 baguettes: Xbox live oO
 nnovich-OK: Are there vim-mode users? I'm struggling with remapping ESC to different key, would appreciate any help
 elderlybeginner: imap jj &lt;Esc&gt;
 elderlybeginner: not permanent thou, as you cannot save your configuration
 nnovich-OK: Wow, thanks. I was trying inoremap, but it isn't accepted
 elderlybeginner: It's kind of crippled vim-mode
 nnovich-OK: I believe, keybinding configuration can make thigs permanent, but I can't figure out proper command to bind.
 elderlybeginner: I stopped using CG editor. Try CG Local.

 bigmazi: is it possible to know whether validation failed due to timeout or due to incorrect answer?
 ANONYMOUS42: i think it should tell you in the error output that it timed out
 bigmazi: I have all tests passed, it's validation after after submit that fails
 bigmazi: 1 validator to be exact
 bigmazi: The first post on forum is about the same validator failure... probably, a bug in tests?
 bigmazi: entire forum for that task is about a single validator failure
 jacek: what puzzle
 bigmazi: Genome Sequencing
 bigmazi: I actually found what's the issue
 bigmazi: interesting, how there's no such tricky edges in the tests
 bigmazi: the fun part of it is that validator has misleading name
 bigmazi: A + C = ACall people (including me) think that A and C are inputs and AC is expected output
 bigmazi: but it actually means that AC is in input too
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: hello
 AntiSquid: hi
 jacek:  
 erogazino: hi guys!
 Krxs94: hi
 Wontonimo: and a happy Sunday to everyone
 Astrobytes: and to you Wontonimo
 Warpup: How do you go backa level in mean max?
 jacek: you cant go to lower league
 Warpup: rips wanted to try and do it faster
 Wontonimo: submit a horrible bot before being promoted
 Nachosauce: This site tickles my brain in good ways
 Wontonimo: i did that in UTTT before advancing from silver.  Got my bot to be 4 pts above the boss before advancing ... real fun to watch it destroy everyone in the league, and then  back to being humbled in Gold
 Wontonimo: hey Nachosauce, how are you liking Coders Strikes Back?
 Nachosauce: I was having a great time until I got to where they added collisions and I hit a bit of a wall haha. Going to play in mean max a bit then I'll be going back and win somehow :D
 AntiSquid: baka * Warpup
 Warpup: Hm?
 AntiSquid: spelling
 Warpup: :upside_down:
 AntiSquid: :alien:
 AntiSquid: should i buy yuan? i wonder
 jacek: btc? yes
 AntiSquid: wouldn't go all in on btc
 AntiSquid: the buy-in phase was imo early this year ... maybe it goes up maybe not, are you continuing to buy btc?
 jacek: just holding
 AntiSquid: do you never sell when you see / expect a dip&#160;?
 AntiSquid: sell *
 jacek: i have less than 0.5
 jacek: maybe ill sell it itll be 1 millions
 AntiSquid: don't think so, expecting some gov created crypto coins at some point
 Creaator: Where should I start learning algorithms?
 Nachosauce: here! :D
 Creaator: First one was Voronoi diagram.
 Creaator: for AI
 jacek: tron?
 Creaator: Let's give it a tryüòÅ
 AntiSquid: clobber :o
 Creaator: is that an expression or game?
 struct: I think wondev woman also requires voronoi diagrams
 Creaator: To find her sword or lassoü§£
 jacek: does :notebook: :soccer: require voronoi?
 jacek: :thinking:
 Creaator: Yes, to check reach for footbal, and avoid getting in range of  others
 Creaator: BTW you can use any other better suited algo
 struct: paper soccer isnt football
 Creaator: I didn't see paperüòâüòâ
 ichwarsnix: I just played Clash of Code, but it was rather strange reverse challenge and none of the participants found a soloution. Im curious what the solution is. Is there any way to find out?
 Creaator: Sorry, new here.
 jacek: there are external 'tools'
 jacek: what was that frog's site?
 Nachosauce: ohh I don't like the reverse ones. I'm terrible at them haha. So really I should be practicing them but bleh.
 jacek: maybe here if you remember some words of that clash <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 ichwarsnix: Thanks, i have found it now

 ichwarsnix: you have to see the input strings as hexadicimals, but everyone thought about ascii code
 jacek: such a plot twist
 darkhorse64: what a lack of nerd culture.
 testachehab: all tests are tests for coders not engineers
 darkhorse64: A coder that does not speak hex is not a coder. It reminds of this joke. Why nerds can't tell the difference between Haloween and Xmas&#160;? Because 31 oct = 25 dec
 jacek: :drum:
 Nachosauce: Cup&lt;T&gt;&#160;:)
 Scarfield: what a deadbeef joke :p
 AntiSquid: where's the hex in that joke&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Jokes shall never be explained
 AntiSquid: irrelevant if you explain it or not, there's no hex in it
 Scarfield: like magicians never reveal a trick
 jacek: theres no hex in hexapawn as well
 AntiSquid: ya but if one expected a rabbit and they get something else they are disappointed
 AntiSquid: promised hex delivered oct
 Scarfield: oh he pulled a pony out of his hat, what a disapointment :p
 Nachosauce: Someone pull some lunch out of a hat, I'm hungry
 AntiSquid: maybe he had no hat and the pony was an asspull
 Scarfield: ^
 jacek: expected rabies, got herpes
 Nachosauce: Been there.

 MasterCoderxD: hey guys
 MasterCoderxD: i need help
 MasterCoderxD: Problem:
 MasterCoderxD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mime-type">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mime-type</a>
 MasterCoderxD: My Solution:
 MadKnight: what is the question&#160;?
 MasterCoderxD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bdb7da40-47d3-4a90-b693-bff5c0c5063b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bdb7da40-47d3-4a90-b693-bff5c0c5063b</a>
 MasterCoderxD: I am getting 2/10 test cases failed
 MasterCoderxD: Can y'all tell me why?
 MadKnight: be more specific
 MadKnight: what exactly goes wrong in these cases&#160;?
 MasterCoderxD: one is too long, the other idk (it's a validator/hidden testcase)
 MadKnight: what do u mean by too long
 MasterCoderxD: i mean it's a timeout error (the input is too long)
 MasterCoderxD: hello?
 MadKnight: are u sure it's the length of the input&#160;?
 MadKnight: maybe your ccode just crashes&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eww, you have a few wierd things going on
 MasterCoderxD: i know i am just 16, i am still learning lol
 MasterCoderxD: and MadKnight: Yes I mean, the number of files is way too high, and my code can't calculate it in the given time period
 MasterCoderxD: :upside_down:
 MadKnight: just use map
 PatrickMcGinnisII: use associative array
 MasterCoderxD: if u can, can u give me a solution? (in code)?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: d[a.lower]=b
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then you dont have to loop thru all of them
 MasterCoderxD: that's what i am asking, can u give me the code?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: d.haskey(blah)&#160;: 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google is your friend
 MasterCoderxD: omg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't do python
 MasterCoderxD: k
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Use a dictionary
 MasterCoderxD: that's what i did
 MadKnight: d[key] = value
 MasterCoderxD: mad knight can u give me a solution?
 MasterCoderxD: as in entire code? lol if u can
 MasterCoderxD: gotta go now, see y'all later
 MasterCoderxD: if u can y'all can send me a solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a MasterCoderxD huh, yea we don't do that
 Scarfield: "im learning, give me solution" :p
 jacek: xD
 Scarfield: hey hey now, i have copyrighted "xD"
 MadKnight: lol when did that happen&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Ages ago. Even changed names to EcksDee at some point.
 Scarfield: ^
 MadKnight: and how did that happen&#160;?
 Scarfield: I'll accept paypal
 jacek: so mastercoder is his alt
 Scarfield: i actually dont have an alt
 Astrobytes: Fix it AltlessField
 Scarfield: xD
 MadKnight: mastercoder asking for a full solution
 Scarfield: oh, his name :o
 PatrickMcGinnisII: paypal for solutions... wow this could turn into DiabloII real quick
 Scarfield: i see you added en passant jachess
 Passifi: since there are so many bot people around here anyone got any recommendations for getting into Deep Learning and Neural Networks&#160;? Books, online resources&#160;? I know some of the basics like linear opimization and stuff but I'd like to get a bit more of a practical insight 
 jacek: reinforcement learning by sutton <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf">http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf</a>
 jacek: and/or ng andrew's coursera course about machine learning
 Scarfield: you know python? the book: "make your own neural network" by tariq rashid is good to get into the basics
 Passifi: Oh cool even a link thanks Jacek I check it out and yeah Scarfield I know some Python enough to hack myself thru I guess so I take a look at rashid too thanks&#160;:)
 RSBat: For reinforcement learning I watched a course by David Silver from DeepMind
 Passifi: btw the german version of the rashid book cost 25 ‚Ç¨ on amazon the english original almost 45 ‚Ç¨ I'll never understand these english textbook prices...
 jacek: or random tutorials from medium.com until it clicks
 jacek: it clicked when i made xor example from scratch without libs
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sevic5Vy4E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sevic5Vy4E</a> this seems to be a presentation of much of what is in his book, havent seen it though, so no idea if its worth the watch. Cheaper than the book though :p
 Passifi: oh well I like books&#160;;) and thanks to you BSBat that should do it for awhile no I just need to dig in, not get it, think I get it , then realizes I didn't get if after all and then rinse and repeat. Ahhh learning computer stuff.
 wlesavo: Passifi, on RL there is this book by Sutton, who is i believe one of the main ideologists for the problem.and it is disscussed there from the very fundumental point of view
 Passifi: yeah thats the one Jacek has recommended its already on my harddrive&#160;:)
 Nachosauce: Roundabouts what time do they update ranks?
 Scarfield: i think its around 4am paris time (?)
 Astrobytes: 2 am - ish iirc
 baguettes: am?
 baguettes: It's pm
 baguettes: Oh
 baguettes: I thought you were talking about the current time
 Scarfield: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: Depends of where you are.
 Astrobytes: Hence "paris time" :P
 BlaiseEbuth: I really would like to ban you for cultural appropriation, baguette.
 Astrobytes: :flag_fr: :cheese: :wine_glass:
 jacek: :french_bread:
 Scarfield: :fromage:
 jacek: hows your chess
 jacek: any search yet
 MadKnight: wow 4am in paris
 MadKnight: it's not even 22h here
 MadKnight: stop moving paris on the world map, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you are supposed to be in silver
 jacek: noob
 MadKnight: imagine being in bronze
 MadKnight: cool kids chill in wood
 jacek: bronze csb?
 Scarfield: started writing the search today, will hopefully finish it up tomorrow. Redoing my weird non-recursive minmax, but with iterative deepening
 jacek: non-recursive minimax? what witchery is that
 Scarfield: i was told at some point "recursion is slow" so made it without recursion. no idea if it was worth it, but for iterative deepening i can reuse the tree, which i suppose will be worth it
 jacek: recursion is generally slow, but its not the bottleneck here
 MadKnight: recursion is actually bad in MCTS
 struct: Which one was doing better in csb, minimax or smitsimax?
 struct: before the NNs showed up
 jacek: MadKnight only if its really deep
 MadKnight: yea
 Scarfield: i believe you jacursion, but recursive functions are not my friend, and all the expansion i save might actually be worth it here. im just assuming (as always xD)
 jacek: xDDDD
 Scarfield: wait.. do you reuse the tree when you increase the maxdepth?
 Astrobytes: struct: smitsi replaced minimax iirc
 jacek: in minimax there is no 'tree'. though i somewhat reuse it via TT in iterative deepening
 jacek: but for chess im using jacekmax so i dont care
 Scarfield: hmm i have a tree, maybe this abomination is worthy of being EcksdeeMax
 Astrobytes: ScarfecksMax
 Scarfield: im sure it will revalutionize the chess bot community
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/how-to-make-a-chess-engine-play-weaker">https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/how-to-make-a-chess-engine-play-weaker</a>
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Get yourself a placeholder on chessprogrammingwiki
 Scarfield: i must
 Scarfield: if my intuition for this is as good as my sense of direction, its certainly wrong
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Nachosauce: Code vs Zombies is a fun one
 struct: One of the most beginner friendly I think
 AntiSquid: what's that link for jacek?
 struct: even stockfish lets you change the elo I think
 struct: But it just makes obvious blunders, so its not very realistic
 AntiSquid: chess engines play completely different from humans though, i don't see how it helps playing vs them yourself
 reCurse: There's ways to make it realistic it's just not been quite as explored
 struct: I agree, if you change elo it just seems to make a random move based on chance, the lower the elo the higher the chance
 struct: But I could be wrong
 struct: I never read the code
 jacek: and it was obviously trolling from my part. xD guy could revolutionize weakest chess
 Wontonimo: using published games of humans vs humans.  For each configuration+move, have the bot make it's move.  Now you have labeled data: human vs machine move choice.  Use that as training data for a discriminator NN.
 Wontonimo: now you have an NN that can say if a move looks human.  Use that with your chess engine to restrict the kinds of moves it is allowed to do to not be too machine like
 AntiSquid: i'll believe you when i see it work on chess.com
 Wontonimo: haha .. yes.  for sure
 struct: Their bots that are named after players dont even resemble their playstile at all
 Wontonimo: the other thing about chess.com, is the time it takes a human to make a move.
 struct: not even the openings
 AntiSquid: does it track mouse gestures? window active state&#160;?
 Wontonimo: (if you are good which i'm not)  it's real easy to notice when someone is using an engine while playing
 struct: Probably
 Wontonimo: because they take just as long to make really hard moves as super obvious ones
 struct: But their cheat detection is not great
 AntiSquid: because they are doing it wrong Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: how would they do it better AntiSquid&#160;?
 struct: to be fair its not that easy to detect a good cheater
 Wontonimo: i saw 1 video by 1 YT guy (so i must be an expert now) where he showed someones win rate over time,  
 Wontonimo: "noone jumps 500 elo in a month"
 struct: What if its a new account?
 Wontonimo: and the looked at their strength of move throughout the game and when there is not enough time left to check an engine the&#160;% accuracy of plays drops through the floor
 Wontonimo: he was looking at accounts that have a few years of history ... starts at 100, climbs slowly ... maybe to 800 over a year, then jumps to 1800
 Wontonimo: in a month
 struct: You dont even need to check an engine
 struct: I saw a script that wrote the css on the page with arrows
 struct: to highlight the moves
 AntiSquid: you can drop a lot if you play stupid or have a bad streak, depends who is online
 jacek: turing test for chess eh
 AntiSquid: bad idea
 Astrobytes: ping MSmits: How's your Clobber meta mcts?
 MSmits: useless&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Hahaha
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0692d2b6-baed-410b-9ff5-4d25f01d2812">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0692d2b6-baed-410b-9ff5-4d25f01d2812</a>
 MSmits: all converging on 50% I think
 BlaiseEbuth: MSmits 50 packets sent, 50 received. Time 0.002 sec
 Astrobytes: Certainly looks that way MSmits
 MSmits: if i try to go down the tree by the principal variation, i get to depth 3 or 4 
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 jacek: visits are not uniform
 jacek: eh
 MSmits: maybe if i did 100 million games I would be able to get a tiny advantage
 MSmits: jacek no i just did a normal exploration
 MSmits: in connect 4 i forced equal visits because we were considering steal option
 MSmits: this game is just not bookable I think
 MSmits: maybe with a far better bot. I dunno
 Astrobytes: You may have more luck with endgame solvers
 jacek: the game is msmits-unfriendly. approve already
 MSmits: hmm, yes maybe
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, on that note, do we mostly agree that it's ready?
 MSmits: in any case, sticking with 8x8 is justified
 DevilJamJar: lol they have mods for this? damn ok
 MSmits: very much needed DevilJamJar
 Astrobytes: For CG purposes 8x8 is more than enough yes
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: 10x10 is used in Olympiads and such jacek, not really feasible for CG
 jacek: hm was for the mods
 Astrobytes: Oh ok, lol
 MSmits: well Astrobytes is a mod
 Astrobytes: Yeah DevilJamJar, sadly necessary, we don't just kick/ban people though
 MSmits: no, they also bring a happy cheer
 jacek: why i havent been kicked alreay is beyond me
 Astrobytes: MSmits :rofl:
 Astrobytes: jacek: I have been sorely tempted many a time
 Astrobytes: But you're regular and we know you're a massive troll so...
 BlaiseEbuth: I just kick/ban people
 MSmits: Today, i did some scheduling and found out that about 80% of my study work left needs to be done in the next 30 days =/
 MSmits: so will be pretty busy i guess
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: that's why we love you dude
 BlaiseEbuth: :hugging:
 Astrobytes: MSmits: that sounds doable but definitely head-down time
 MSmits: at least the stuff will be done when next contest happens
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, when is that
 MSmits: earl ymay
 MSmits: 5 or 6, i forget
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, 6th iirc
 Astrobytes: Right, gonna put a comment on Clobber that I think it's ready
 MSmits: how do you feel about nine men's morris?
 MSmits: it has 2/3 approved already
 Astrobytes: I haven't tried it properly yet but it also seems good to go. Won't approve without a bot though ofc
 MSmits: yeah i didnt try a bot yet either, i just spotted a couple textual errors and the creator fixed those
 MSmits: it's one of those boardgames i found in an old pile when i was young and i just played my own version of it. Never knew the actual game rules
 MSmits: that's kinda why i like it. Nostalgia
 Astrobytes: Also, on that note, if we are gonna have nine men's morris, there's a whole bunch of 'simple' games we should probably port too. As we said before, nothing wrong with games to practice on.
 Astrobytes: I think I learned nine men's morris from my grandad
 MSmits: it's not actually as simple as it seems
 MSmits: I think brute force alone might not cut it. Needs some domain knowledge to solve
 Astrobytes: Yes I know, what I mean is "ooh it's solved can't port that"
 MSmits: yeah thats nonsense
 MSmits: it will be my next game when this study stuff is done
 MSmits: it's interesting, entire game state fits in 1 uint64_t, but because there's 24 spots on the board, there's quite a lot of early branching
 MSmits: they solved it in 1993, which leads me to believe there's some provably safe pruning you can do
 Astrobytes: Yes for sure
 MSmits: if i can understand the method they used to solve, I should be able to reproduce locally. But that's not the same as putting a perfect playing bot together in CG constraints
 Astrobytes: No it certainly is not. Unless you book the feck out of it ofc :P
 MSmits: there's still CG constraints with that
 Astrobytes: Well yeah
 MSmits: normally the code size limit is not a real limit, because calculation time locally is the real bottleneck
 MSmits: but when it is all solved, the codesize does become a limit
 Astrobytes: Fix your compression :P
 MSmits: because you dont need to keep running games to be more sure of the node value
 MSmits: yeah. The game has about 10^12 gamestates if you also consider the turn you're in i think
 MSmits: lots of transpositions
 MSmits: tree is much more complex than this
 MSmits: ofc
 Astrobytes: Fairly beastly but definitely pruneable.
 Astrobytes: (With a Prune Array ofc)
 MSmits: it's like oware and onitama, not that many states, but a huge tree
 MSmits: ofc&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, similar. Ah sht, still have to do Onitama
 MSmits: it's a fun game
 MSmits: I just ran out of ideas to improve further, or i would still be doing it
 MSmits: one of euler's masterpieces imho. He keeps saying "I only ported it", but he sells himself short
 Astrobytes: He always does
 Astrobytes: So does struct
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: I need to get through the pending contrib games before anything else
 Astrobytes: There's still jrke's game, need to write an actual bot not just movegen for amazons
 MSmits: is jrke's game based on anything?
 Astrobytes: And there's another 2 or 3?
 MSmits: volcanoes too
 Astrobytes: MSmits: He says not
 Astrobytes: Yeah Volcanoes, the tanks one
 MSmits: that's dangerous. I mean it;s cool he has his own idea, but it could more easily backfire if it isnt tested well enough
 MSmits: certainly looked cool
 Astrobytes: I thought it was based on something if I'm honest
 Astrobytes: I haven't played it yet though, so I will reserve judgement
 darkhorse64: Clobber is ready for approval
 Astrobytes: Have all language stubs been tested?
 darkhorse64: C++ is enough
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Just in case of someone trying it in VB and it doesn't work 
 darkhorse64: It does. Should I check PHP&#160;?
 MSmits: you can also just ask Patrick if he intends to ever play it. If not, it's cool
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes:  I got a rockstar quote into my approval
 MSmits: Jokes aside and then you write it as a game review :P
 Astrobytes: It's a game!
 MSmits: yeah ok...
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: I wonder if mikkla will play this
 MSmits: he did wel on D&amp;B
 MSmits: well
 Astrobytes: ah yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm interested as to who is going to solve this more mathematically
 Astrobytes: *play this
 MSmits: I might try that at some point, but not any time soon. It's very time consuming
 MSmits: I wrote the clobber bot in less than a day, but with math it<i>ll be weeks at least</i>
 Astrobytes: I struggle to find much literature on it
 MSmits: well there's enough imho. It's just a lot to learn before you understand what they are talking about
 Astrobytes: I mean, it's used in loads and loads of papers as a benchmark, but not much actually out there dedicated to it
 MSmits: it's starting to look like you need to become a combinatorial expert to do some of these multis. At least at the top
 Astrobytes: Mmhm, and btw, I meant to mention it previously, the notation we were seeing that we spoke about I believe refers to combinatorial games
 MSmits: yeah i knew that part
 MSmits: I just cant read it
 Astrobytes: Some papers have a handy table at the start or as an appendix
 MSmits: yeah the D&amp;B ones do
 Astrobytes: I didn't save the damn paper
 MSmits: which
 Astrobytes: The best one I found to help reading one of the clobber papers
 Astrobytes: Grr.
 MSmits: it's probably in the references of this: 
 MSmits: file:///C:/Users/Michiel/Downloads/An_introduction_to_Clobber.pdf
 Astrobytes: I should have used brain nicely to constrate
 MSmits: oops
 MSmits: file:///C:/Users/Michiel/Downloads/An_introduction_to_Clobber.pdf
 MSmits: again
 Astrobytes: Thanks for giving us your filesystem 
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: I'll rename my HD 
 MSmits: to make it harder to hack me
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227859257_An_introduction_to_Clobber/link/0912f5072c2114e56f000000/download">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227859257_An_introduction_to_Clobber/link/0912f5072c2114e56f000000/download</a>
 MSmits: for some reason it likes to open the file in a browser window
 MSmits: then it seems like it is a webadress and you copy it as if it is
 V_Brawl: if someone hacks you he can do anything with your computer(he doesn't need to know your username to do it)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, because you've downloaded it and it's locally available
 Astrobytes: But no, not that one
 MSmits: yeah i know V_Brawl that's why I wasnt worried&#160;:)
 V_Brawl: okk
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, references, yes, might be
 Astrobytes: C:/Users/MyNameHere/ is mine
 jacek: this one is a must read <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322530755_Analysis_and_Qualitative_Effects_of_Large_Breasts_on_Aerodynamic_Performance_and_Wake_of_a_Miss_Kobayashi&#39;s_Dragon_Maid_Character">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322530755_Analysis_and_Qualitative_Effects_of_Large_Breasts_on_Aerodynamic_Performance_and_Wake_of_a_Miss_Kobayashi's_Dragon_Maid_Character</a>
 Astrobytes: Not exactly helpful info :P
 MSmits: too long jacek
 MSmits: use url shortener
 jacek: its a physics paper
 MSmits: I know, you shared it before
 Astrobytes: jacek: is that paper not a bit overdone here now?
 jacek: overdone?
 Astrobytes: overused
 MSmits: jacek is of the opinion you can't overdo large breasts I think
 MSmits: not me ofc, 
 jacek: where do you use the knowledge of the paper here
 Astrobytes: Well I won't comment on that part but the paper has been linked too many times to be funny any more :P
 jacek: im gonna reference it in my engineering paper
 Astrobytes: jacek: We obviously need a multi where it is applicable
 MSmits: maybe if csb had aerodynamics
 Astrobytes: Eh. You'll give emh ideas
 pardouin: Bust-A-Boob
 MSmits: ah. Emh likes things that flap in the wind?
 Astrobytes: You have never seen his NSFW CSB?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thats why i think he might like things that flap in the wind
 MSmits: did he make that on the sdk?
 MSmits: i just saw the screenshot of it
 struct: I dont think so
 Astrobytes: Not on SDK no, was his own engine iirc
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: hi struct
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hey, do you know some good (easy)  examples where you can use greedy solutions and hillclimbing?
 jacek: what screenshot? what are you talking about?
 MSmits: so far i got the TSP
 MSmits: i got the hospitals having to be near houses on a grid (minimize nearest distance)
 MSmits: backpacking problem, or at least, filling moving boxes
 struct: Tower of Hanoi should be simple
 MSmits: yeah but i mean an optimization problem
 MSmits: where its easy to find a solution
 MSmits: but not easy to find the best solution
 MSmits: Hanoi seems more like an easily solved game
 GeorgiD: duck -&gt; udkcgiraffe -&gt; rigaeffprogrammer -&gt; rgorpremma
 GeorgiD: Any idea what algorithm shuffles these words?
 jacek: the halves of a word
 MSmits: ye, keeps middle in place
 GeorgiD: Ohh yeah
 GeorgiD: Thank you
 pardouin: (.)(.) -&gt;revert
 struct: sorry MSmits I dont know any
 MSmits: ahh thats ok. I can find one i think
 pardouin: n queens probem
 pardouin: +l
 MSmits: I need it for my study paper
 MSmits: what is n queens problem? Sounds like amazons
 MSmits: ohh wait
 MSmits: i got it
 MSmits: its filling a board with as many queens as possible
 MSmits: without having them be able to hit eachother
 pardouin: yes
 Astrobytes: Without them attacking each other
 Astrobytes: ah you got it
 MSmits: i remember reading that somewhere
 Westicles: Are you really unable to imagine eight powerful women in the same room without them trying to kill each other?
 jacek: n queens? without attacking each other? especially when they are dressed the same?
 MSmits: seems hard to use hillclimbing on it though
 MSmits: I mean it is an optimization problem, but not one with small enough steps to use hill clmbing with my students
 MSmits: TSP has some easy changes you can make to create better solutions
 pardouin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-hill-climbing-algorithm">https://www.baeldung.com/java-hill-climbing-algorithm</a>
 Astrobytes: Small enough steps? Moving a queen to another square?
 MSmits: yeah but you need to fit extra queens at some point
 pardouin: in an aerodynamoic way
 MSmits: well I guess you can make a list of all possible changes and then check if any allow for an extra added queen
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: And yeah
 MSmits: I can put it with the hard examples
 MSmits: it does have a good way to do a  greedy solution
 Astrobytes: It's an acceptable problem to tackle with hill-climbing for demonstration purposes
 MSmits: just start top left and move systematically downward, if a queen is allowed, place it
 MSmits: yeah seems to be
 MSmits: I'm gonna use it I think
 Astrobytes: Haricots froids
 pardouin: nonogram maybe
 Astrobytes: mmm yeah, nonogram could be cool
 MSmits: seems hard
 MSmits: also why are you advertising vegetables Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I just said "cool beans"
 darkhorse64: you know there is a n-queens puzzle here&#160;?
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: did not know darkhorse64
 pardouin: also a nonogram one
 MSmits: but wont be using CG anyways, it's a coding-free course I am doing
 MSmits: so it's mostly about putting algorithms into words
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/n-queens">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/n-queens</a>
 MSmits: ahh nice
 pardouin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/nonogram-inversor">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/nonogram-inversor</a>
 pardouin: (but the idea is more to solve it logically, no real backtracking)
 MSmits: there is a puzzle for everything on CG&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks for the suggestions guys
 MSmits: I think the queens problem is great for my class
 darkhorse64: Actually, you can hardcode the answers making it an easy puzzle. I have seen also  a nearly one liner python solution
 MSmits: I can actually make them solve it by hand using the pawn-sets i have and a paper grid
 Astrobytes: also you can use optimisation algos to solve mathematical problems
 MSmits: Maybe create another python turtle visualization
 MSmits: yeah thats not part of the class, but also very interesting
 Astrobytes: as in equations etc
 Astrobytes: approximations etc etc
 MSmits: how complicated is the queens problem btw?
 Astrobytes: you know what I mean
 MSmits: yeah I know
 MSmits: I mean... TSP goes off the chart quickly in complexity
 MSmits: how does this go with the queens problem?
 Astrobytes: I think it's NP complete
 Astrobytes: Depending on the algorithm the time complexity can vary
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I found an old website about it that has a solver
 MSmits: However, your browser does not support Java. If it did you would not see this message! Get a java compatible browser such as Netscape, of a sufficiently advanced version.
 MSmits: it says that
 Astrobytes: "such as Netscape" - love it.
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: it was the browser on our university computers when I was there
 MSmits: only time i ever used netscape
 Westicles: A coding-free algorithm course... er, was that your idea?
 MSmits: yes, but mostly out of necessity
 MSmits: they just dont have the coding knowledge to be able to do an AI course using actual code
 MSmits: AI tends to be more complicated than other things related to coding
 MSmits: it's kind of all or nothing that way
 MSmits: we do teach doing, but mostly simple python
 MSmits: coding
 Westicles: Huh.  Back in the old days they tried to weed out people like that
 MSmits: i am teaching 15-17 year old Westicles, in high school. Not university students&#160;:)
 Westicles: Ah, okay&#160;:)
 MSmits: I even let them do machine learning
 MSmits: it's quite cool how much of an understand they can get without coding
 MSmits: I did the wolf/dog/snow question on a test
 MSmits: and many got it right
 Astrobytes: The world needs more teachers like yourself
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: if you dont know the example I mentioned, it's quite cool
 MSmits: they trained a NN to differentiate wolves and dogs in pictures, but they didnt realize all the wolf pictures had a snowy background
 MSmits: so they trained a NN to recognize white&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a bias thing
 MSmits: so my question in the test showed these pictures
 MSmits: and then a wolf on grass and the question was why the NN mislabeled it
 MSmits: as a dog
 MSmits: they also got quite far with the tensorflow playground
 MSmits: it just needs some cutting up into managable pieces. 
 Astrobytes: That's cool. Yeah, breaking each part into understandable chunks. Chunking is half the battle
 MSmits: but for my paper i am just focusing on the optimization chapter. It's just 3-4 50 min lessons that I have to improve
 MSmits: i have to find literature, get design rules, hypotheses, use data i gathered, improve design etc.
 MSmits: lots of work
 Astrobytes: I think you'll breeze this
 MSmits: meh, I think it's mostly lack of motivation for the literature stuff
 Scarfield: saw a video once where they made a NN recognize some different animals, one of the animals was a "prize fish" so almost always some fisherman holding it in his hands. The NN learned to recognize the fingers around the fish xD
 Astrobytes: It's like - wait, being a student again! :P
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 Westicles: Somehow I envision a class full of kids with propeller hats and trying to eat the glue, and MSmits is trying to teach them algorithms ;P
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: It's the Netherlands Westicles, don't be silly - they SNIFF the glue!
 MSmits: Scarfield yeah i know that example, good too
 MSmits: I think i used it in a powerpoint
 MSmits: well some of them read this chat so I wonder if they will read it and mention this tomorrow :P
 Astrobytes: Hopefully :grin:
 MSmits: "Sir, why did you not defend us last night, not ALL of us sniff glue! "
 Scarfield: "Mr teacher, what is your opinion of aerodynamics on big breasts?"
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: eh I hope they skipped that part of the chat
 Astrobytes: You see Scarfield? Glue sniffing is fine in the Netherlands but don't get breasts involved
 jacek: i will repeat if they forget
 MSmits: I did not doubt it
 MSmits: you will probably repeat if they don't
 jacek: when does your class starts
 MSmits: mmh I think I should stop talking now :P
 Astrobytes: Fantastic Breasts and Where To Find Them: a study by jacek
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: did you just think of this one?
 Astrobytes: yes, I am fairly sure it's not original
 jacek: he browsed the arxiv
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer or jacek, one of you able to approve Clobber?
 Astrobytes: tric is offline or I would have asked him too
 jacek: i used all my points in fireworks
 MSmits: there's points?
 jacek: trust
 MSmits: you had trust?
 jacek: apparently
 MSmits: where can you see trust?
 jacek: AntiSquid complained i approved fireworks without bot
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: AntiSquid points
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but you have one in clobber
 MSmits: I remember seeing some drama about that, but it did not prevent him and others getting hooked on fireworks
 Astrobytes: You had a bot in fireworks jacek
 jacek: random one
 Astrobytes: Yes, but that's enough to test usually
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what is the difference if it is for testing?
 MSmits: the mechanics yeah
 MSmits: well depends on the game really
 MSmits: the game could be too easy to play perfectly, then you need more than a random bot to test. But this does not apply to fireworks
 Astrobytes: The 'issue' that arose from squiddy was something that could have been addressed during the wip stage, squiddy wasn't around for a while though and didn't pursue writing a bot for it
 jacek: its heuristic and much rps
 Astrobytes: Yes
 jacek: and im 1st in clobber :tada:
 MSmits: yay
 MSmits: still mcts?
 Scarfield: you used EcksdeeMax didnt you?
 jacek: yes
 Scarfield: i knew
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: i had trouble train it
 Astrobytes: Gonna use ToDeeMax I think
 MSmits: right
 jacek: EcksdeeMax is powerful. just use opposite move
 Astrobytes: betaAlphaMaxMin?
 Scarfield: well that is how i choose a direction if im lost
 MSmits: anyways, heading to bed early(er) tonight. Long day tomorrow
 MSmits: gn guys
 Scarfield: gn
 Astrobytes: Gn MSmits, take it easy
 darkhorse64: :white_check_mark: level 40&#160;!
 Scarfield: well farmed
 Astrobytes: ayyy congrats!
 KoliaYovko: I'm only playing clashes and I think i will never achieve lvl 10 or so
 Astrobytes: You can rest your ankles a bit now after all that farming activity :D
 Astrobytes: Do puzzles, multiplayer bot programming, optimisation or codegolf instead KoliaYovko
 KoliaYovko: alos, gj!
 KoliaYovko: but clashes is so fun and easy nah
 darkhorse64: It's a nice thing to promote with a contrib
 Astrobytes: Indeed. How much is a contrib? 250?
 KoliaYovko: anyway, python guys smash me in Shortest code mode
 Astrobytes: Use ruby or python then.
 darkhorse64: Yep, plus upvotes
 Astrobytes: It saddens me that clash contribs  give the same as multis&#160;:(
 KoliaYovko: I only need C++ for my work, so...
 Astrobytes: KoliaYovko: If C++ is your thing you really should be doing bot programming imo&#160;;)
 KoliaYovko: I'll think about it, sounds interesting
 Astrobytes: Plenty games to choose from, whether you like physics-based, board games, maze/grid-based games or none of the above
 darkhorse64: A multi is more work but it's also more interesting. I did some Java, learn more from the SDK, ...
 Astrobytes: I need to get my finger out and do morpion solitaire
 Astrobytes: It's just java that puts me off and makes me procrastinate
 Astrobytes: Also I recently discovered the different meanings of 'morpion(s)' :D
 darkhorse64: If you know C++ or C#, Java is not that different
 Astrobytes: Well, it is. It's much clunkier and terribly verbose.
 darkhorse64: French is a rich language
 JBM: innit
 Astrobytes: oh hey JBM, where you been hiding
 JBM: on #fr, same old
 JBM: heya astroes
 darkhorse64: 47/50 vs my boss
 darkhorse64: :flushed:
 Astrobytes: Good stuff. I did sneak a peek - that poor man's iterative deepening... shocking
 KiwiTae: french shouldnt be a language :stuck_out_tongue:
 JBM: well---it is now
 JBM: deal with it
 darkhorse64: Comments for insiders
 Astrobytes: I noticed :D
 KiwiTae: o/ 
 Astrobytes: Kiwiiiii how is Bretagne
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what algorithm is the boss, darkhorse64?
 Astrobytes: alphabeta minimax
 KiwiTae: sweeet&#160;:) Astrobytes its chill love it
 darkhorse64: That was enough to strengthen the boss and beat random. In the end, there are so few choices that a random bot can play quite perfectly
 Astrobytes: Yes, this is very true
 UnnamedCodinGamer: to which depth does it go?
 darkhorse64: 10
 Astrobytes: KiwiTae: Don't forget to eat as many kouign-amann as you can and drink as much lambig (if you can find it) as you can
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes what are those &gt;&lt; so far only been eating crepesand drinkin cider
 darkhorse64: lambig is an awful thing
 Astrobytes: Seriously darkhorse64? I've had some rather good 'homebrew' varieties myself
 darkhorse64: Only tasted it once, too bitter, too strong. I prefer chouchen
 Astrobytes: KiwiTae: The former is a cake/pastry depending who makes it and the latter is a distilled cider concoction
 darkhorse64: Stealing #1 from jacek
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: You need to taste more lambigs, really. Also, chouchen (and most mead-based drinks) is great
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it would have been nice to be able to test against the bot more than once
 JBM: how did i not know lambig
 UnnamedCodinGamer: *boss
 ridafkih: Can I turn off the sound
 ridafkih: on this website
 Astrobytes: Oh JBM you would love it, I am pretty sure of this.
 JBM: will definitely give it a try next time
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ridafkih, I would like to know the same
 Astrobytes: Not sure how much you find in shops, there's usually guys go around selling it from local stills
 Astrobytes: Don't just get a random one though ,talk to people and find the best
 Astrobytes: It should be smooth, packed with flavour, and just a little bit deadly :D
 darkhorse64: UnnamedCodinGamer: the default boss is the league 2 boss
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: once you are past him, there is no way back
 UnnamedCodinGamer: that is what I meant
 darkhorse64: Yep, but it is available in Wood 1 too
 Astrobytes: It's only there to filter out random bots with no algorithm
 ridafkih: The sound from the countdown timer/notifications is earblasting me
 ridafkih: I can't take it hahah
 Astrobytes: Do you have a volume control
 Scarfield: you can mute your browser tab
 ridafkih: There is no volume indicator, and I don't want to turn down my browsers volume in the mixer
 ridafkih: Guess I'll just deal with it meh
 ridafkih: Good to get me flinching before a coding exercise, I guess.
 Scarfield: if firefox rightclick the tab, mute
 ridafkih: oh u right
 darkhorse64: ^
 ridafkih: Brave has it as well
 Astrobytes: Or just don't clash, do multis and puzzles instead :P
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Less noisy :D
 darkhorse64: Ah, the nice level up beep
 Astrobytes: That's always good. That and the next league beep.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Scarfield, nice I had not noticed that
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: UnnamedCodinGamer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I can not self-ping
 Astrobytes: Circular reference?
 Astrobytes: No you cannot
 UnnamedCodinGamer: can you?
 Astrobytes: Nope
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I meant me&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ping you? UnnamedCodinGamer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it works
 Scarfield: ooh testing sound xD
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I wanted to try the mute feature
 Astrobytes: lol
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, I have multiple tabs open and only one muted
 Astrobytes: Random trivia: some Scottish people say 'pung' instead of 'pinged'
 Scarfield: and some Scottish people teach smitsi new funny words
 Astrobytes: And 'jamp' rather than 'jumped'
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah, that is funny
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: euler was the one I used to teach the most new vocabulary (proper English) to
 UnnamedCodinGamer: watching snooker I also noticed that they use took instead of taken
 UnnamedCodinGamer: sounds unnatural to me
 Astrobytes: "I jamp e'er the fence 'n' the barbed wire pung me in the leg!
 Scarfield: fool of a Too
 Scarfield: Took*
 UnnamedCodinGamer: could have took
 Scarfield: i hope he comes back to learn some more 
 Astrobytes: That's past tense vs past participle iirc UnnamedCodinGamer?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 Astrobytes: The UK English speakers can be a touch lazy about that
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes I think it is UK English vs American one
 Astrobytes: It's (I think) 'simple' past tense, so it's gettable-away-able-with :P
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it still sounds unnatural to an ear trained to watch american productions
 UnnamedCodinGamer: to hear
 Astrobytes: Yeah of course, they got it all wrong :D
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, they could have taken another path
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: What like learning the native languages when they arrived there? :D
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but I guess they did not need it, as they had their own
 Astrobytes: Extermination is easier than assimilation I suppose. Woop, sorry, getting political. I stop now.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, Clobber-wise, I can't remember which bot is my good one
 darkhorse64: Try all of them
 Astrobytes: Yes I'm doing that hehehe
 Astrobytes: I submitted something
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, especially "extermination" is pretty loaded, and rightly so
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have the same problem
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have four of them
 Astrobytes: I've got 8
 Astrobytes: Meh. Not like it's gonna disappear or anything&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: This one looks OK for promotion
 Astrobytes: Should just have submitted the current one probably, it had a bug that I fixed though :D
 Astrobytes: Always a losing move to fix the winning bug
 Astrobytes: ahhh
 ridafkih: yall ever just look at a question
 ridafkih: and you know you're capable
 ridafkih: but just
 ridafkih: "nah" and nope out?
 Astrobytes: No.
 Michael_48: when the thing on the side is like 3 paragraphs and it gives like 4 variables
 Michael_48: i just nope
 Astrobytes: Good luck with a real life project
 Michael_48: yeah
 Michael_48: i have braindead attention span
 ridafkih: lmao Astro
 ridafkih: If it was a real life project
 ridafkih: I would sit there and solve it
 ridafkih: but you see
 ridafkih: it isn't
 ridafkih: Mans takes this too seriously
 Astrobytes: Not at all.If, in fact, you're talking about a clash I don't consider them at all never mind take them seriously.
 Michael_48: nahh
 Michael_48: its just when the problem is trying to understand what is being asked, instead of figuring out how to code it
 Astrobytes: Well isn't that half or more of the actual problem? The coding part should be the easiest.
 Michael_48: right but its a coding website&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Understand the problem, formulate some kind of solution - code it.
 Michael_48: comprehend the problem... spend 5 minutes reading the problem... still trying to comprehend the problem...
 Michael_48: it never gets to the code part
 Astrobytes: You doing clashes?
 Michael_48: yeah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: 6 losses out of 81 games
 Michael_48: dang
 UnnamedCodinGamer: solid performance 
 Astrobytes: Try puzzles. No time limit
 Michael_48: hmm
 Michael_48: maybe
 ridafkih: Oh, I guess there is more stuff on this website huh
 Astrobytes: No not 'maybe'. The problems are *far* more interesting in the puzzles section
 Astrobytes: Eh yes
 Astrobytes: Most of the guys you've seen in chat the past while do multiplayer bot programming
 Astrobytes: We write bots to play games.
 Michael_48: haha i just like the competitive aspect of clashes
 Michael_48: but ill try out puzzles
 struct: there is also ai programming
 Astrobytes: Try the competitive aspect of a bot programming leaderboard&#160;;)
 Michael_48: ooou
 Michael_48:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: (that's what struct means by AI programming)
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Michael_48: interesting
 UnnamedCodinGamer: do not get overwhelmed by bot programming if you are new to algorithms
 Astrobytes: Yeh, just go with if else
 Astrobytes: Learn along the way
 UnnamedCodinGamer: first learn and try out algorithms in the puzzles section
 MadKnight: he's just doing clashes calm down
 AntiSquid: make a better one that tops them all, no need to choose then
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll :D
 MeSeet: Hi all, I've got a small question, been there for a while, mostly doing clashes (I like the fact that I just have to focus for a few minutes and go away after that), but I kinda feel that I'm wasting my 'learning' time with clashes, cause usually, either I kinda have an idea how to solve them or I just skip/hardcode/random them. What would you suggest if you were in my shoes?
 Astrobytes: Puzzles? Depends what you want to accomplish really.
 Astrobytes: There's a whole bunch of stuff to choose from other than clashes
 AntiSquid: multiplayer section MeSeet
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 AntiSquid: oh clobber got approved
 Westicles: In computational play, clobber is generally played on a 10x10 board.  
 Westicles: A shame it is 8x8 here
 Astrobytes: We made it that way for CG constraints, I initially wanted 10x10
 Westicles: Just for the bitboards?
 Astrobytes: Olympiad versions of games don't necessarily work too well on CG
 Astrobytes: There's that, but you can bitboard 10x10 too it's just a little bit more work
 struct: 1 thread, also timelimit is 15sec per player
 struct: But there isnt a time bank
 Astrobytes: Point being, there's enough there within the CG constrains to keep people busy
 Astrobytes: *there in the 8x8 and  *constraints (Should've used my brain to constrate) and 
 Astrobytes: and nothing
 Astrobytes: Same goes for Amazons
 Astrobytes: 10x10 on CG is not realistic compared to Olympiad conditions
 Westicles: I see.  No draws allowed so the game needs to finish in 150 turns or whatever
 Astrobytes: There are no draws in Clobber
 Astrobytes: The loser is the one who has no moves left

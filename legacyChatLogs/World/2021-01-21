 Celtis24: how can we fight friends?
 BlaiseEbuth: If you have friends, don't fight them.
 Salted: Try insults first
 Celtis24: yes obvl... but games you know
 Salted: start a private clash
 eulerscheZahl: delete the default bot
 Salted: or invite them
 eulerscheZahl: the add your friend
 eulerscheZahl: only works for top1000 and your own league+below
 Salted: oh I didn't realize
 Celtis24: thanks

 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah&#160;! I wanna win the SOny air conditioner&#160;!
 MSmits: morning
 eulerscheZahl: 1st prize seems some gaming console. but i have no idea which one
 eulerscheZahl: morning
 BlaiseEbuth: morning
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, time to go to work (aka switch to the other PC)
 eulerscheZahl: bye
 MSmits: bye Euler
 BlaiseEbuth: o/
 dbf: "All french developers" - it is difficult to move to France temporary to participate in hackathon because of restrictions&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Moving to France will not make you french. Nom d'une baguette&#160;!
 BlaiseEbuth: :p
 MSmits: yes, you have to be 
 MSmits: French in your heart
 BlaiseEbuth: Complaining about anything is a good start.
 MSmits: Then I must be a Frenchman born in a Dutch body
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 GhostOcter: pick me qiyana pls 
 Housso: are we going to have acces to the api once the hackathon starts???
 darkhorse64: It's  not an API. You read the inputs that describe the game state and you output commands to drive your bot, changing the game state. You do that in a continuous loop. I suggest that you look at the puzzle the descent (not a bot game) which works this way
 Housso: oh oki'm used to Halite formati did some puzzles so i should be ok then thanks for the info
 Passifi: Good Morning Vietn... eh chat
 MuhammadMehediHasan: :D
 MuhammadMehediHasan: anyone here?
 kowodo: yep
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 MuhammadMehediHasan: lol
 MuhammadMehediHasan: ðŸ¤£I am new here
 kowodo: cool. Enjoy!
 vinacal: How i can see again my code in "clash of code"
 jacek: if its finished, you should have it in notifications
 ShinobiCode: Hi everyone. How can I see how other's solutions to puzzles that I have also solved? I need to see if I'm the only one using a 2d array to solve porcupine fever.
 jacek: in the results
 jacek: learn from best coders
 ShinobiCode: Just found it. Thanks!
 N01S3: Hey, does anyone know where to start if I were to create a program that reads text on an image?

 Hogachaka: openCV + pyTesseract&#160;:)
 N01S3: Yeah I found that towardsdatascience blog post as well haha

 Zead456: how to be good programmer?
 reCurse: Awesome, I can ignore, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: seems that Sopra took the San Francisco 2442 game into consideration but then decided against
 reCurse: Wonder why :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: didn't try but I think the contest reduces strategic depth compared to the real codebustes
 Astrobytes: meh, codebusters again&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: and no leagues so we can skip :D
 reCurse: I'm fine with that
 eulerscheZahl: me too
 Astrobytes: Yup.
 reCurse: Would rather spend my free time on ML anyway
 eulerscheZahl: i might try topcoder marathon next week
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the game
 Astrobytes: you've really caught the ML bug reCurse&#160;:)
 reCurse: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: do you think Onitama is doable with ML?
 reCurse: It's all about landing that pod
 reCurse: Sure, I'll get to it eventually
 reCurse: I just think there's no point if I can't beat the simpler games
 reCurse: Othello already made me realize a few weaknesses
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to pressure you, don't worry
 reCurse: None taken
 reCurse: I really think it's an interesting game
 eulerscheZahl: just curious as you understand the topic better. and the cards might make it hard
 reCurse: But it's easier to spot weaknesses on simpler games
 eulerscheZahl: so many combinations
 Astrobytes: Yeah, better to iron out bugs/weaknesses before tackling anything more complex
 eulerscheZahl: games like othello and connect4 sound great for that
 reCurse: Still dreaming of 5950x and rtx3080
 reCurse: Yeah they are
 eulerscheZahl: do we need a fundraising for reCurse?
 Astrobytes: Simple ruleset means you can diagnose issues easier, it's not because you implemented some rule wrong, or it's a quirk of the game etc
 reCurse: I don't need money
 reCurse: I need a checkout that works
 kovi: anyone tried mu0 nn?
 reCurse: muzero sounds uninteresting if you can simulate the model perfectly
 reCurse: Keep in mind deepmind never really cared about board games
 reCurse: It's all about applying RL to models too complex to simulate
 kovi: isnt the dynamic model adds a new dimension?
 reCurse: What do you mean
 kovi: not sure, i just want understand why it can be better than alpha0
 reCurse: It's better when you cannot simulate the model
 reCurse: Because it learns the model and then searches into it
 reCurse: But if you already have the perfect model there's no point to learn it
 kovi: oh, i c
 reCurse: Ok addendum because I said something rather stupid, there is a point to learn it if you can make it much cheaper to simulate
 reCurse: Complex physics have been made much cheaper with learned models
 reCurse: None of that would apply to the kind of complexity we have on CG though
 jacek: muzero CSB :drool:
 reCurse: *complex* physics
 jacek: connect4? it involves gravity
 reCurse: Sure
 eulerscheZahl: not the jacek i was expecting
 eulerscheZahl: fixed it for you: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pinterest.com/prickly_boi/connect-4-memes/">https://www.pinterest.com/prickly_boi/connect-4-memes/</a>
 jacek: do people actually see my memes links? :o
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 eulerscheZahl: you are like a MK in more funny
 kovi: recurse: but if it is not boardgame...the freedom of "state" model can also be advantage
 eulerscheZahl: sounds more like a RAIC thing than CG
 reCurse: It could be, but I have trouble seeing it if it's not cheaper or impossible to compute otherwise
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it would probably work for something like RAIC
 reCurse: Not even sure for RAIC because it wouldn't yield enough fps to be useful I think
 reCurse: Unless they somehow optimized their engine for it but I have my doubts
 reCurse: I also think it's probably an order of magnitude more complex to make muzero work
 kovi: my concern is stuffing more nn into cg codesize
 reCurse: I need millions of simulations per second to make it useful
 reCurse: At the risk of sounding like a broken record
 kovi: and yeah, longer learning
 reCurse: Code size. Is not. An issue.
 eulerscheZahl: :grammophone:
 Astrobytes: It's called a turntable these past 75 years or so euler... :P
 jacek: let him enjoy his childhood once more
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: What would be the modern equivalent? At the risk of sounding like a free spotify account?
 reCurse: Oh I know. At the risk of sounding like a AT&amp;T/Comcast/whatever connection
 Astrobytes: Vinyl records are definitely still a thing.
 Astrobytes: So broken record is fine.
 reCurse: The point of those idioms is they were mainstream though
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Still are for now... How much longer I'm not sure.
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of users thinking there's a hidden message in the CG reversing game
 eulerscheZahl: and then sharing a screenshot of the TV test image
 VizGhar: is this same as standard codebusters after getting all the rules?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: standard: each buster can do everything
 eulerscheZahl: this contest: one hunter, one stunner, ...
 eulerscheZahl: which further reduces your possible actions
 VizGhar: yeah ok, haven't solved standard cb before
 VizGhar: #not5percent
 eulerscheZahl: go to the multiplayer arena, probably more fun than the contest
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 reCurse: Not clear to me whether this reduces strategy but shrug
 eulerscheZahl: there will be less fighting for instance. as only 1 buster can stun
 Astrobytes: Unless of course you wish to experience the competiti- no, 'fun' contest vibe :P
 eulerscheZahl: hm, then again you have to time the stun better i guess
 eulerscheZahl: i've decided i won't join the contest (i guess private ones can still be competitive)
 wlesavo: what contest?
 eulerscheZahl: feel free to prove me wrong

 eulerscheZahl: bitcoin is skyrocketing again
 eulerscheZahl: might be a good time to sellon the other hand I barely have any left&#160;:(
 jacek: wait for 100k usd
 reCurse: I'm more concerned about ethereum skyrocketing tbh
 reCurse: Though all cryptocurrencies are sort of linked
 eulerscheZahl: because of your GPU?
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: Cuck those flowns
 kovi: fell 20-30% in a week....but doubled in 1-2 month
 kovi: and we talk about writing nn to some boardgames instead of predicting crypto prices
 jacek: linear eval is so last century
 eulerscheZahl: do your weather forecast already kovi
 reCurse: Can't predict the unpredictable
 reCurse: Stupidity is predictable but its actual form isn't
 eulerscheZahl: and then they are suddenly in the Capitol
 karliso: reCurce Do you now use nn in uttt?
 reCurse: Yes
 jacek: finally detronized karliso eh
 Wontonimo: really?  I was expecting your to say no
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: kerliso: do you use NN?
 karliso: No, I have no idea how to do nn. That is something I plan to study.
 NASIRUDDIN: hi
 NASIRUDDIN: i need help
 jacek: how to...

 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 jacek: what help do you need
 Wontonimo: can we have a competition to write a bot to respond with "how to ask a question"
 NASIRUDDIN: with coding
 NASIRUDDIN: how old are u
 Astrobytes: Epic.
 NASIRUDDIN: jacek
 NASIRUDDIN: how old are u

 reCurse: There are so many red flags in that link
 reCurse: Not clicking
 eulerscheZahl: i just clicked it
 eulerscheZahl: it has a pie chart
 NASIRUDDIN: are u guys kids
 reCurse: I also successfully trolled a troll
 jacek: pinkie pie chart
 NASIRUDDIN: hey guys
 eulerscheZahl: most of us regular users are grown adults
 NASIRUDDIN: so u adults too
 Astrobytes: lol "he also likes ponies..." :rofl:
 jacek: also? as in the person saying it likes ponies?
 Wontonimo: thanks for the feedback about NN / nonNN guys.  Considering you are holding the top 2 slots, it's very telling there are many ways of approaching uttt
 NASIRUDDIN: are u guys are kids or adults
 reCurse: The best way to approach uttt is to close the browser
 Astrobytes: OK I accidentally inserted the 'also' from reCurse's secondary comment jacek.
 NASIRUDDIN: wft
 NASIRUDDIN: wft
 reCurse: Ok you're starting to get on my nerves
 reCurse: Behave
 NASIRUDDIN: u guys are adults
 reCurse: Yes
 reCurse: Act like one
 NASIRUDDIN: really
 reCurse: If you must
 Wontonimo: but if i close the browser i'll miss out on all the chatter ... (oh, discord)
 NASIRUDDIN: joking

 NASIRUDDIN: u guys are gids
 NASIRUDDIN: kids
 NASIRUDDIN: joker
 reCurse: Saved by struct
 eulerscheZahl: i was sitting there like "who will get the kick first?"
 reCurse: I don't kick
 Astrobytes: Just ban.
 isimkullanmiyorum: Hello 
 reCurse: Hi
 Wontonimo: reCurse, i hear you prefer g++ over c++.  Do you use a bash cat &gt;&gt; ./a &lt;&lt; EOF ... EOF command to deploy g++ in CG&#160;?
 reCurse: I prefer a compiler over a language?
 Wontonimo: yeah , i though it heard you say that a couple days ago
 eulerscheZahl: makes no sense to me, you need both
 Wontonimo: that you have a preference of compilier
 reCurse: My preference is clang tbh
 Wontonimo: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: never tried clang. what's better there? more telling error messages? better code optimizations?
 reCurse: Hmm
 jacek: who cares about compiler as long as it is the faster
 jacek: st
 reCurse: Wrong
 reCurse: There's a lot of good things about clang, not sure where to start
 reCurse: For CG the simplest reason is I get the same thing between windows and CG
 reCurse: err, linux
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't CG use g++?
 Wontonimo: There's this youtuber. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatsACreel">https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatsACreel</a> who goes over assemble output of clang vs gnu vs ms compiliers.  all produce very different levels of optimization under different situations
 reCurse: Ah, true
 Astrobytes: I like that creel guy
 reCurse: Yeah of course
 jacek: cereal guy?
 Astrobytes: ...
 reCurse: Though to be fair they're all relatively similar
 reCurse: At this point
 reCurse: Except msvc is terrible with intrinsics for some reason
 reCurse: Like, garbage tier
 Wontonimo: CG's is g++ 9.2.1 mode C++17With the following libraries â€‘lm, â€‘lpthread, â€‘ldl, â€‘lcrypt
 Wontonimo: but, you all already know that&#160;:)
 reCurse: clang also has great diagnostic tools
 reCurse: It's extremely well done overall
 reCurse: Compared to the mess of gcc
 reCurse: Just had to play catch up for years optimization wise
 reCurse: But it's there now I think
 reCurse: I think one of my favorite warnings is "wrong indentation" when you put 2 statements on the same line of a loop without braces
 reCurse: One of those times where you're like, this compiler is a cool guy
 kovi: wowRÃ©mi Coulom described the application of the Monte Carlo method to game-tree search and coined the name Monte Carlo tree search
 jacek: i use this al lthe time for (int i=0; i &lt; 10; i++) cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " "; cout &lt;&lt; endl
 RoboStac: g++ has that too (though I imagine it took it from clang)
 reCurse: Oh you didn't know kovi? He's a big gun.
 kovi: he really is
 reCurse: Was a consultant for alphazero iirc
 jacek: the Crazy_Remi eh
 Astrobytes: Think he supervised the guy who came up with the alphazero stuff
 Astrobytes: something like that
 reCurse: Also came up with tons of stuff for mostly go
 kovi: some of my ex-colleges work (eg. t1024) was active in gobang ai competitions
 reCurse: Made Bayeselo for rating chess engines
 jacek: gobang?
 kovi: but remi is definitely a level above
 reCurse: CLOP for optimization, though I never got it to do anything good
 reCurse: etc
 reCurse: Had the strongest go engine for a while too I think?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Crazy Stones?
 Astrobytes: Or Stone
 1400179: CrazyGo
 1400179: Oh no you're right
 1400179: My bad
 Astrobytes: All good. Very impressive dude regardless.
 jacek: but he didnt invent smitsimax nor jacekmax so he doesnt count
 kovi: but smitsi is based on mcts
 kovi: anyway...for d&amp;b they are at same level&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but i have the suspicion that one worked harder on it than the other
 kovi: coould probably win othello as well
 jacek: but not :notebook: :soccer:
 Iachaudray: How are yall so smart
 Iachaudray: iIhave to search up your guys' abbreviations lol
 jacek: oh my
 reCurse: I'm not smart I'm just good at pretending
 Astrobytes: Lies!
 reCurse: You're right, not always good at pretending
 Astrobytes: From that statement I deduce you have found a bug.
 Wontonimo: those who are good at pretending never admit at being good at pretending
 Astrobytes: And some of those who think they are pretending are not (see imposter syndrome)
 Wontonimo: (just plain imposter, no syndrome)
 Wontonimo: speaking of imposters, I've gotta put my money where my mouth is and convert my uttt python code to c++.  Thanks for all the inspiration (no /s)
 jacek: :tada:
 Astrobytes: Nice. Plenty people around here willing to help if you have some questions as you go along
 struct: games where you know all the cards but dont know what opponent draw are interesting for CG or no?
 struct: You can still predict what card opponent is trying to play based on his previous actions
 reCurse: That's heavily dependent on the game im
 reCurse: o
 Astrobytes: Indeed. What did you have in mind struct?
 struct: I agree, I also talked with astro, I might try to port it.
 struct: Was thinking on porting amazons before it though, was thinking on making the starting position forced if I can find any balanced list like jacek did for othello
 MSmits: struct, seems rather pointless with amazons to go through the trouble of forced starts
 MSmits: doesn this have thousands of openings?
 MSmits: I suggest you first try without the forced openings, let some people make a bot and see how varied the starts are
 MSmits: if everyone starts the same way, then it might be necessary
 struct: yes it has thousands
 struct: but im not sure how good they are
 MSmits: thats why you do testing. Code the game in such a way that you can easily add them later 
 MSmits: maybe I'll do a meta mcts to test, like i did with connect4
 MSmits: though, not sure how painful this will be, with the enormous lists I will get inside the program
 MSmits: lists like this i mean:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc03f3bf-2f1d-454b-85ca-a1d9e51bd726">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc03f3bf-2f1d-454b-85ca-a1d9e51bd726</a>
 MSmits: they would be insanely long for amazons
 struct: Ill check how big it is
 struct: for first 2-4 turns
 MSmits: and of course my tests would only be good if i can write a good bot. My cookie cutter searches dont work well in every game... i sucked at BT
 Astrobytes: Yeah, as I said, I don't think it'll be necessary as I don't believe it's particularly bookable other than maybe a few bad moves.
 1400179: Never a bad idea to make it as unbookable as possible
 MSmits: well, in general you're right, but it's kind of a classic game. You don't want to veer too much away from it if it gives you zero or almost zero benefit
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It's worth the experiment I guess but we have to test the original first.
 MSmits: for chess it was a great decision to do it ofc
 MSmits: the annoying thing about forced openings is also, that you have to be really sure they are balanced
 MSmits: or at least balanced enough so that it doesnt matter
 MSmits: well my csb overhaul was a bust, I converted to floats, got 10% sim increase, fixed some other weird stuff and then ended 10th. I think I float to 6 over time with submits from others
 1400179: Converted to floats?
 MSmits: yeah i had doubles, this was like my 2nd multi :P
 Astrobytes: struct: 10 x !0 amazons right?
 Astrobytes: *10
 struct: yes
 1400179: Whoa
 MSmits: i did br2k in floats, never bothered to go back to csb
 Astrobytes: Cool.
 MSmits: any increase wouldnt let me beat the NNs anyway, turns out i was right :P
 MSmits: next thing i could do is avx, but thats a lot of work, i want to try code of the ring first
 struct: First turn has 2176 possible moves
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: unique?
 struct: No
 MSmits: probably divide by 8?
 MSmits: cuz the board is square
 struct: doubt its 8
 MSmits: seems like 8 to me
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: maybe 4
 Astrobytes: 8?
 Astrobytes: oh nvm
 MSmits: nah it has left right symmetry only
 MSmits: so 2 =/
 struct: yeah I thought it was 2, but im not very good at this stuff so I kept quiet
 Astrobytes: Just port it already man
 MSmits: and i talk a lot so all you gotta do is wait and i start to make sense eventually
 1400179: Million monkeys theory?
 MSmits: just 1 monkey that talks a lot
 Astrobytes: Infinite Smits Theory
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: btw, I now have 2 possibly 3 CG projects in my CS class
 MSmits: people making a bot
 MSmits: as their last years project
 1400179: Can we strike a deal
 1400179: If they shit up the chat you flunk them
 Astrobytes: lol, Smits students (one at least) has a good track record
 struct: Dutch people behave well
 Astrobytes: *have
 MSmits: If they cause problems I will tell them their grade lowerst 1 point every time i get another complaint. Will that do reCurse?
 1400179: Sure
 MSmits: these guys are pretty mature though
 MSmits: 17-18 yrs old and very intelligent
 Astrobytes: Your first (I think?) student in here was quite cool. Even asking when homework was due by pinging you in World chat :D
 MSmits: i think most times it goes wrong it's a teacher dumping his entire class into CG while they barely know any coding
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah that was fun :P
 MSmits: he said something like, i couldnt reach you through school medium and i knew you were here so...
 Astrobytes: I forgot his name, but he did a contest? OR unofficial 'contest'
 1400179: He knows where you slack off
 Astrobytes: Maybe both
 1400179: You have no escape
 Astrobytes: And yeah lol
 MSmits: right reCurse
 MSmits: he did pacman
 MSmits: ended high silver i think? maybe low gold
 MSmits: top 20%
 struct: Is it me, or does the middle line look thicker?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/xoil5dA.png">https://i.imgur.com/xoil5dA.png</a>
 1400179: It is
 Astrobytes: I don't remember tbh. thies joo? Was that him
 MSmits: yes
 1400179: Probably sitting on a pixel edge
 1400179: You need to align it properly
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: he's now doing game of drones
 MSmits: as his project
 Astrobytes: Oh cool
 struct: I think I hve the same pixel  problem on othllo
 1400179: Yay 3d rasterization
 MSmits: another guy is doing CSB
 struct: If I make it fullscreen it fixes itself
 Astrobytes: And the other one MSmits?
 MSmits: she's doing some puzzles to find out whether she can code well enough for it, she's not sure
 jacek: let them do :soccer: :imp:
 MSmits: but she's good I think
 Astrobytes: Well, hope she does. Good learning experience.
 MSmits: yeah it is
 struct: Interesting, the 2nd move can even have more legal moves than the 1st
 MSmits: jacek, I would but it's probably too hard
 Astrobytes: Also depends which puzzles she chooses to do
 MSmits: struct makes sense, because you're not stuck against the border
 MSmits: astro doing temperatures now I think
 MSmits: isn't temperatures one of the easiest after onboarding?
 struct: Yeah, I usually dont read anything about the games
 Astrobytes: OK cool, make sure she doesn't get 'off the beaten track'
 MSmits: maybe marslander 1 is easier
 struct: Some people struggle on temperatures
 jacek: descent
 MSmits: sure
 struct: they are not aware of abs
 jacek: they dont exercise?
 MSmits: descent confused me at first
 Astrobytes: shut up jacek :D
 MSmits: because i wasnt used to the game loop
 MSmits: so you have a loop within a loop
 Astrobytes: Once used to the input stuff it's a case of doing it on paper first
 MSmits: yeah, thats what i said as well, do it on paper first
 Astrobytes: I mean |x| isn't that different from abs(x) is it
 MSmits: I think for temperatures she made a negative list and a positive list, then sorted both. Seemed like a good apprach
 Astrobytes: If you apply the correct constraints yep
 MSmits: it's kinda hard to gauge if they're actually ready for it
 MSmits: stuff on CG I mean
 MSmits: some are so talented, they can dive in here on their own, never needing any help, but if they have barely coded before, how do i know?
 Astrobytes: There're a lot of either mathematical theory or algorithmic puzzles so it can be a bit daunting depending on experience
 MSmits: yeah you do have to be selective about the puzzles
 Astrobytes: (and both together ofc&#160;:) )
 MSmits: I came in here knowing more about math than about coding, so i sometimes forget that for most people its the other way around
 1400179: Wasn't there a whole study about how to teach computer science that basically boiled down to nothing better than "some get it and some don't"?
 MSmits: sometimes i do get the feeling it's like that reCurse
 Astrobytes: Really? Interesting
 MSmits: it's teachable to some degree
 1400179: Gonna be a hard one to google I think though...
 MSmits: might be similar to math and physics
 MSmits: not sure if coding is even more like that maybe
 Astrobytes: Coding is coding. Understanding the underlying theory is CS
 MSmits: brb
 Astrobytes: I know at least 2 people irl who work as a C# and Java developer who did degrees and never took a class in data structures and algorithms.
 Angecide: reCurse u have a link to that study?
 Astrobytes: (And one who's just an idiot)
 1400179: Like I said gonna be a hard one to google, it's just a random memory from something I've randomly read years ago
 therealbeef: I think everyone could learn it, but for many it will be so uncomfortably hard that they will give up
 MSmits: therealbeef yeah that's a good point
 1400179: Ohh maybe that one? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2632320.2632354">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2632320.2632354</a>
 Astrobytes: CS-wise, some people just see mathematics and instantly recoil
 therealbeef: how to divide a problem into bits and solutions to standard problems and how to put solutions into code; it's all rules that you could learn
 MSmits: it's hard to say when you have "learned" it though. At some point you need to be creative enough to use the tools well and solve problems. Not just understand what other people wrote
 MSmits: you can learn the alphabet and write words, but writing a story is a different thing entirely
 1400179: Yeah I think it's that one...
 MSmits: cool, will read it
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, great points.
 therealbeef: when my wife did a minor in data science and had to learn python; it just didn't 'click' somehow, though she understood the theory behind functions and variables and classes
 Angecide: reminds me of the different stages of Bloom's taxonomy
 MSmits: yeah thats the same thing Angecide, or close enough
 MSmits: I actually had a question about that in one of the tests i had to pass :P
 MSmits: it was something like, think of an activity in the classroom and use Bloom to describe it, something like that
 therealbeef: interestingly, she could understand code when reading it, but to create it was too hard
 MSmits: I learned it mostly because I needed it to get something done
 MSmits: like, write a script to turn a light on when i enter a room in my spaceship in space engineers. 
 MSmits: short programs to do something simple
 MSmits: i think if you start like that and you're motivated, it helps a lot
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there're definitely some who come from scripting games and such
 struct: I started programming on Garrys mod
 struct: You could program lua on there
 MSmits: thats cool struct
 MSmits: think you can use lua in minecraft as well?
 Astrobytes: Haha I remember Garrys Mod
 MSmits: I had one student learning lua that way
 Astrobytes: Yeah, also that roblox crap
 1400179: We have some serious crimes to answer for, not embedding better languages
 jacek: colobot?
 MSmits: is lua a bad language reCurse?
 1400179: Yes.
 MSmits: what would you have used instead? 
 Astrobytes: Hell yes. Have you ever used it?
 1400179: Good question
 MSmits: i never tried lua myself
 Astrobytes: aCat loves it
 1400179: Indexing starts at 1.
 1400179: It is impossible to defend
 MSmits: ok that settles that
 MSmits: reminds me too much of vba
 Astrobytes: And it's inexplicably used as a scripting language in many, many games
 1400179: Inexplicably...
 1400179: It's actually very explicable
 1400179: It's incredibly easy to embed
 Astrobytes: I was just about to type that
 Astrobytes: Yes, it is
 1400179: The real crime is to not have come up with something better to embed
 1400179: But alternatives are rather lacking
 MSmits: I remember people writing little tools in lua for browser games
 MSmits: to calculate attacks and such
 MSmits: probably just a consequence of them not knowing other langugaes
 MSmits: because these were not embedded
 MSmits: many people call javascript a crime too
 1400179: That's very true
 MSmits: at least all my RL friends do
 1400179: Quite possibly bigger than lua given reach and scope
 1400179: Lang itself is a bit better sure
 1400179: But damage is far greater
 jacek: RL?
 MSmits: real-life
 jacek: oh
 MSmits: like not you
 MSmits: it's hard to imagine I know :P
 jacek: i thought of reinforcement language
 1400179: RL in post-covid...
 jacek: learning*
 jacek: &gt;&lt;
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: it's also Raidleader
 MSmits: in mmorpg circles
 MSmits: just to be complete
 therealbeef: Hmm, the C++ assistant doesn't match the compiler. It complains about auto as function argument type, but compilation is ok
 Astrobytes: Don't you people have IDEs!
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Just try to ignore it.
 Astrobytes: Unless it's a real error. Good luck with that :P
 MSmits: if I look at my C++ assistant, all the code is orange&#160;:(
 MSmits: maybe should not put my opening book at the top....
 struct: my intellisense breaks all the time too, dont worry
 RoboStac: the trick is to have two sections of long unicode nonsense so the formatting fixes itself
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: lol
 therealbeef: the assistant also craps out when using too much template stuff, but that's understandable given the resources
 Astrobytes: The assistant craps out if you look at it.
 MSmits: template stuff i shard to compile?
 MSmits: as in using more tiem?
 MSmits: my typing sucks today
 MSmits: I guess the assistant is good for small programs, but who would use c++ in a small program generally... I only ever use it on 500-1k line programs here
 therealbeef: yes. i once build a tictactoe solver with template meta programming. took 1 minute to compile
 MSmits: maybe you overengineered that :P
 Astrobytes: I only tweak parameters and stuff when I use the CG IDE, unless as you say it's a puzzle or something, when I use Go or python or something (C++ too)
 therealbeef: well, you get instant lookup of the solution at run time, so the payoff is amazing
 struct: What is max time for compilation on CG?
 MSmits: I once did a solver like that in python in the browser basically. It was actually a minimax, but it remembered all the results, so on the first move it solved the game
 therealbeef: i understand CG has a 10 sec compile limit, otherwise c++ would be even more overpowered
 struct: Depends on language right?
 RoboStac: around 10 seconds
 struct: CG still compiles everytime the bot plays a match right?
 reCurse: Unclear
 MSmits: thats really weird that that would be unclear
 Astrobytes: Didn't they 'apparently' do something about that?
 reCurse: It used to yes, but they did optimizations
 reCurse: The state of which I'm not sure
 MSmits: i guess you'll see when they update the compiler and old bots break 
 MSmits: if they break on the leaderboard as well, then apparently it's recompiled
 reCurse:&#160;?
 reCurse: Not necessarily
 MSmits: not sure if that ever even happens with c++. Aren't they big on backward compatibility?
 reCurse: Definitely not gcc lol
 MSmits: hm ok
 RoboStac: only for fully defined code and it's very hard to not accidently hit implementation / undefined things
 MSmits: ah I see
 RoboStac: and even then more recent versions have started to break stuff
 Astrobytes: Relevant forum post:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/133">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/133</a>
 Astrobytes: (re compiled bot versions)
 Astrobytes: There's another one I'm sure but I fail to find it.
 struct: I think I recall thibaud saying its not stored
 struct: But I can be wrong
 MSmits: must be a lot of work keeping all these languages somewhat updated
 reCurse: Without containerization :scream:
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: Draws are imposible on amazons apparently
 struct: Was trying to figure why my code had no check for that
 reCurse: Best game feature
 MSmits: only if the game is complex enough that bots don't sense the p1 or p2 advantage at the start
 MSmits: it's not good in uttt&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Have you played Amazons?
 MSmits: even if it does have draws
 MSmits: i havent
 MSmits: have you?
 MSmits: if so, is it fun?
 Astrobytes: Yes. And yes, it is.
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: You can play it with just a chessboard
 MSmits: with pawns i guess
 Astrobytes: (obviously different size)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, queens and pawns
 MSmits: can humans make sense of the strategy to use in this game?
 MSmits: In Othello this seems quite hard
 reCurse: Is it
 MSmits: well for me anyway
 MSmits: i know its good to have corners and edges in othello
 MSmits: but thats about it
 jacek: because you simply never played othello
 MSmits: sure
 jacek: or at least at some amateur level
 struct: Your mind is shaped for Yavalath
 MSmits: it is&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 reCurse: *book
 MSmits: no I am actually pretty good at yavalath. I could beat my own minimax bot sometimes at highest level 
 MSmits: possibly the book is in my head :P
 reCurse: You've probably studied opening theory as much as a chess titled master
 Wontonimo: yeah me - just implemented bitboard logic in c++ for the miniboards with win lookup using int[512] 
 MSmits: for yavalath yeah reCurse
 MSmits: so much staring at meta mcts
 Astrobytes: This is why you need to make an informal paper and send it to the dude
 Astrobytes: (not The Dude but the Yavalath dude)
 MSmits: I might do that at some point
 MSmits: yeah Cameron you mean
 Astrobytes: Yep
 MSmits: Wontonimo gj
 reCurse: Win lookup with an int? :scream:
 Wontonimo: long
 Wontonimo: sorry
 MSmits: think you just made it worse :P
 Wontonimo: oh haha
 struct: :door:
 Astrobytes: uint...
 MSmits: not sure if it matters much whether you use int, uint, uint8_t or uint16_t. I generally go with the smallest type that fits and prefer unsigned
 MSmits: for a small table like that, may not matter as much
 Wontonimo: for sure
 MSmits: i went all out with lookups for uttt, something i may change on my next rewrite
 MSmits: I have a 18 bit lookup for the full board win
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry, it is bool WIN[1&lt;&lt;9];
 Wontonimo: with the index being an int
 Wontonimo: i'm on crack obviously
 Wontonimo: it's a 9 bit lookup
 Astrobytes: And I misread your initial statement too, my bad
 MSmits: you can even fit your entire win table in 8 uint64_ts
 MSmits: 1 bit per board
 Wontonimo: OH&#160;!  Thank you!
 MSmits: it's win, or not, so it's a 1 bit thing
 reCurse: But what about draws
 MSmits: it';s a 1 player look up
 MSmits: so no draws
 reCurse: Won't someone think about the draws
 Wontonimo: no draws.  there's never draws in uttt
 reCurse: wat
 Wontonimo: righrt?  i thought it was designed to always have a winner in uttt?
 struct: no
 Wontonimo: wha?
 Wontonimo: do tell
 struct: you can draw if you have same number of miniboards
 MSmits: reCurse i think you're probably messing with us, but Wontonimo does a separate check for each player when they make a move, to see if they won. if not, then he checks if the board is full
 struct: and neither player has 3 in a row
 MSmits: so he needs 9 bit only
 MSmits: for the board
 Wontonimo: you can't have the same number of miniboards cuz there are 9, one will have at least 5 boards
 struct: no
 MSmits: a board can draw Wontonimo
 struct: to win  a miniboard you must make 3 in a row
 MSmits: I'll just look up a draw
 reCurse: You either lookup or you don't...
 reCurse: Why check for full board after lol
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/522885988">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/522885988</a>
 MSmits: what i mean is, if you store a board as 9 bit per player and then make a move as p1, you check if it's a win for that player
 MSmits: if not, then you check if the board is full, and if so , it;s a draw
 MSmits: looking up a draw, requires a combined p1p2 state 
 MSmits: thats an expensive lookup, cache-wise
 MSmits: it's 2^18 combinations instead of 2^9. Or 3^9 if you do a ternary lookup
 reCurse: 5kb lookup, should stay in cache easily
 MSmits: what is 5kb?
 Wontonimo: okay, i must have misread.  I thought the rules for no-draw also applied to the miniboards.
 Astrobytes: 0.000005 GB
 Astrobytes: MSmits :P
 MSmits: 2^18 lookup is not 5kb 
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: if you use ints, then it's 1 Mb
 MSmits: I tend to use 2 bit to make it more compact
 MSmits: stil 250 kb roughly
 reCurse: 3^9*2 bits
 MSmits: might have made a calc error there, but not 5kb :P
 MSmits: ohh like that
 MSmits: well that's actually what i would do yes, but it requires you use ternary
 reCurse: And?
 MSmits: operations on a ternary board are expensive
 reCurse: Adding and subtracting is expensive?
 Astrobytes: But just for lookups it isn't. I swear you said this yourself MSmits
 MSmits: well you'd look up a from either a small array of powers of 3, or you do the powers themselvs
 MSmits: it's not Astrobytes, but you still have to do some operations
 struct: cache gain might be better though
 MSmits: I have actually no idea what the overhead is of a small array of 9 powers of 3
 Astrobytes: Yeah but negligible cost in the grand scheme of things if I understood it all correctly before
 Kemeros: Hello!When do puzzles of the week end?
 MSmits: might be, the exact results of tests I did are a little fuzzy
 MSmits: the different ways of encoding the board in uttt were all in the same ballpark, each with pros and cons
 reCurse: Anyway my point was if you're going to hit the cache might as well hit it all the way
 MSmits: yeah if it's an isolated change, but it never is with uttt. It's always a balance between lookups and calculation. Not all lookups are worth it
 MSmits: afaik karlis o still uses a 512 lookup for wins
 Astrobytes: I'll save further commentary for when I finally work on UTTT in 10 years.
 MSmits: lol, you mean after I have rewritten it another 5 times :P
 MSmits: nah, 1 more, just 1 more time
 jacek: uttt will be written in quantum lang by then
 Astrobytes: No. When I am finally bored enough to write something for it.
 reCurse: As long as you rewrite it poorly
 MSmits: I only do poorly reCurse
 reCurse:&#160;:'(
 reCurse: tbf I've tried so many approaches I forgot if what I'm babbling about was the best or not
 MSmits: yeah we even exchanged pms about this a few times
 MSmits: you normall dont do that
 reCurse: Easier to do when you ended up with better lol
 reCurse: Don't care about that crap anymore
 MSmits: will you ever try to write a normal search bot again or are you just gonna do networks from now on?
 reCurse: Only for contests
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: +1 and will you attempt Yavalath with your new pipeline?
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: I dont recommend it no, that will be frustrating
 reCurse: I'm already having trouble with othello
 Astrobytes: Due to the difficulties Robo had with it?
 reCurse: Not sure why
 MSmits: robo has a great yavalath bot
 MSmits: definitely the best bot
 MSmits: but, you know...
 Astrobytes: Books right
 MSmits: if you look at the amount of effort people put into their yavalath.. this is a really strong field
 jacek: if i can do othello, why cant you?
 MSmits: yeah book
 Wontonimo: well, mishandling draws is probably why my python implementation failed to achieve greatness (as much as python with its slowness can)
 MSmits: its actually smaller than oware and othello, my yavalath book
 MSmits: jacek you did ntuples i think?
 MSmits: incorporates far more domain knowledge
 MSmits: that gives you an edge. That's not to say reCurse cant beat that, but it's harder
 jacek: ntuples + frontiers and mobility
 reCurse: There's something wrong but I'm not sure what
 reCurse: It gives high winning eval on a proven loss 10k nodes away
 jacek: multiple moves backpropagation error?
 reCurse: It's weird...
 reCurse: Nothing is impossible but I did check multiple times
 Astrobytes: you're not counting pieces surely
 jacek: how do you deal with passes
 reCurse: 2 moves
 MSmits: ohhh passes
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Astrobytes: yeah could be pass moves
 reCurse: I don't do implicit signing stuff
 reCurse: It's always checking against player
 reCurse: I mean it's the same search with 10k nodes that gives proven loss
 reCurse: But initial eval is like 70% win
 reCurse: Shouldn't happen
 MSmits: it's fairly typical for mcts to do this and both jacek and Robo had this problem on BT, where it would give a high eval score, then it plummeted and they lost
 reCurse: But I had zero such issues on BT
 RoboStac: don't you need to lose to have this issue?
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 jacek: i resubmited and i think i have more issues with it
 MSmits: yeah i have no clue why or how, just pointing it out
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523514505">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523514505</a>
 jacek: around 60, it even gives eval 1.0
 jacek: but its losing
 MSmits: might be that NN is not trained well for the late game?
 MSmits: those states arent visited much maybe
 reCurse: Robostac :P
 jacek: it was trained from endgames first
 reCurse: I have the feeling I'll end up spending way more time on othello than I wanted to...
 jacek: but also i had some issues with weights and encoding this time, i dont know why
 MSmits: reCurse maybe wait till struct does his forced opening thing?
 reCurse: I don't really care about the result
 reCurse: But it shouldn't give such wrong evals on what should be simple
 MSmits: ah ok, you just want to experiment
 reCurse: Weird bugs with no explanation kills me
 Astrobytes: Active learning MSmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: sure 
 MSmits: reCurse that sounds like what every good coder can't abide
 MSmits: I never had a bug i did not end up fixing
 jacek: he says loss, then ... then loss again :v <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523515444">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523515444</a>
 MSmits: I can't stop searching
 Astrobytes: No sht :D
 MSmits: i know why that is
 MSmits: you did something thats outside my solved area
 MSmits: so i resolved it
 MSmits: i think thats what it is anyway
 MSmits: yea they are lookups
 reCurse: I wonder if you can do adversarial training to output a troll eval that's hard to detect
 MSmits: like jacek one time printed book on every move :P
 Astrobytes: Someone else did too (in othello at leasT)
 MSmits: if you mean old john, that :poop: is real&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: A while ago
 Astrobytes: Not old john
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Anyway, out for tonight, gn all
 MSmits: gn!
 reCurse: nn
 Wontonimo: gn
 jacek: nn?
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: we need to stop shortening things
 MSmits: jacek can't handle
 reCurse:  
 1400179:  
 jacek: AutomatonNN whats that
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a lot of problems with the same code you dont need to consider t
 MSmits: ohnoes, now you woke him up AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: hey madknight, what do you mean by that in the contest?
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: let;s get the whole gang in here AutomatonNN
 jacek: oO
 reCurse: Stop the spaaam
 MSmits: it worked 
 MSmits: I wonder how long i can put off learning to write my own NN's
 MSmits: put it off for a year so far
 reCurse: Do you enjoy unexplainable pain
 MSmits: I highly doubt you would find counterbooking players on various board games less painful
 reCurse: Or maybe satanic rituals
 Chenalator: what is the best language to learn
 reCurse: English I would say
 Chenalator: Code wise
 MSmits: morse
 reCurse: I answered the way it could
 Chenalator: I only know python
 Chenalator: Thanks
 MSmits: then you know Englsh
 Chenalator: Nvm then
 Chenalator: Have a good day chaps
 MSmits: Chenalator, learn C# next
 reCurse: !howtoaskaquestion
 Chenalator: What is C# used for?
 MSmits: C# is easy to learn and a lot faster than python on CG
 Chenalator: ok thanks
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 MSmits: fastest would be c++, but C# is easier I think
 MSmits: and quite sufficient for most games
 reCurse: You're assuming a lot out of that question
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I guesstimate
 reCurse: Maybe it was the best for clash? The best to do web? Who knows?
 reCurse: The true purpose lost in the chaos of time
 Chenalator: :heart_eyes:
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: so... dont use C# for clash
 MSmits: unles you enjoy very explainable pain
 reCurse: ...or angelic rituals?
 MSmits: or that
 struct: Just dont do clashes would be more suitable answer
 reCurse: Spoilers
 MSmits: I had students in my classroom cyberslacking today
 MSmits: doing CG clashes!
 MSmits: normally students play stupid games when cyberslacking, at least clashes are a step up from that
 reCurse: ...
 reCurse: Citation needed
 MSmits: dont understand that phrase
 MSmits: does that mean it needs proof?
 reCurse: Sure
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed</a>
 MSmits: my point is, for people who still need to get some familiarity with syntax and understanding coding problems clashes are better than racing a car on a track in your browser :P
 reCurse:  /troll-stretch
 reCurse: What if the development of gaming interests contributes to learning C# to do a game in Unity
 MSmits: yeah that would be great. I could also say that the guy who keeps playing online chess in my classroom is trying to develop an appreciation for AI&#160;:)
 reCurse: lol
 MSmits: I actually played a match againt him today and it was a draw =/ I was 12 points up and then he infinite checked me
 struct: Ok I cant understand this pixi stuff
 reCurse: You should have resigned instead
 reCurse: He deserves the win
 MSmits: I suppose
 struct: I drew the lines with line instead of having overlaping lines with rectangles
 struct: and still have the same problem
 struct: on middle
 MSmits: yeah i should have resigned
 reCurse: It's probably not the primitive you use but the rasterization
 reCurse: Try aligning with +0.5 or -0.5 maybe
 MSmits: he already beat me once playing uttt on the whiteboard when he was player 2 :P
 MSmits: and i was using teccles
 struct: will try, thanks
 reCurse: oof
 MSmits: so i was basically playing perfectly for 10 turns or more because of teccles and he still won
 reCurse: That's what happens with random rollouts
 MSmits: i even said beforehand, are you sure you dont want to be p1, i have a serious advantage
 MSmits: lol 
 struct: He probably stole your book
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 struct: These optical illussions
 reCurse: Stop using programmer colors
 reCurse: Oh wait I was thinking of something else nvm
 MSmits: struct do you mean like in D&amp;B?
 reCurse: If D&amp;B then my comment applies
 MSmits: i recently noticed those illusions when someone mentioned it
 struct: nah, it just looked like the white cell was passing the boarder
 struct: Which is impossible
 MSmits: tunneling

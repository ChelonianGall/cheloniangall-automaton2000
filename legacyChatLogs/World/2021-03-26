 Lachrymosa: would someone be able to help explain how I could calculate the barycenter of 2 or more objects?
 Ainizoda: hi
 Ainizoda: who likes React?
 KiwiTae: Lachrymosa a barycenter is a mean
 KiwiTae: sum(objects)/objects.count
 Lachrymosa: I guess I'm looking for centroid of a polygon of N points where N is 2 or more?
 KiwiTae: nonconvex polygons?
 KiwiTae: anyway centroid is still mean of the points within the polygon~~
 Lachrymosa: so if I added all x's and divided by number of points, and all y's the same, the resultant x,y pair would be my centroid?
 Lachrymosa: My maths are rusty save for some quick spreadsheet type stuff&#160;:\
 MadKnight: oh hey KiwiTae Lachrymosa
 Lachrymosa: sup Maddy
 MadKnight: long time no c Lachrymosa
 WOLFRAHH: hii MadKnight
 MadKnight: what are u working on Lachrymosa 
 MadKnight:&#160;?
 Lachrymosa: Thor 2 and some clash
 Lachrymosa: How about you Maddy, what're you workin on?
 WOLFRAHH: hey i am playing Clash of Code
 HemantM: Heyo
 WOLFRAHH: Kiwtae
 WOLFRAHH: can u tell me you learning screate
 MadKnight: some random things Lachrymosa 
 WOLFRAHH: hi dbdr

 DanniBoy: i don't get why people don't share their code when they get 100%
 DanniBoy: it helps me a lot when I see different solutions, and if i don't know any solution, which quite often, I would love to see someone  else solution
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: On the rare occassion I do get 100%, I share my code in hopes of one day receiving feedback about how to condense the 2,000,000 character count.
 Uljahn: e.g. i'd prefer not to share my solution if it's not polished enough which happens quite often considering the time budget of CoCs
 derjack: my solutions are quite polished
 birbDrum: I always share. even if it doesnt work at all
 AntiSquid: they look more polished if they aren't shared
 TFeld: Always share, you might get feedback, or others might learn something
 Rival819: WHYYYYYY!!@@!#!@##
 Rival819: I keep losing by 2 pixels :D
 Rival819: hahah
 AntiSquid: why? i know my solutions are perfect, i don't need people to tell me that
 Rival819: my code his so simple yet works so well....but I keep losing to boss 2 from like 1-2 pixels xD
 derjack: pixels?
 Rival819: yeh im basically over him haha
 derjack: oh, csb?
 Rival819: ahh yes
 Rival819: the pod game
 Rival819: :P
 derjack: pot game. i see
 Rival819: hahaha
 monstaber: @dannyboy I think the default should be that the code is shared, and people would have to actively click a button to keep it hidden
 AnandMan: Wassup people

 Astrobytes: Whatever, just chill Winston
 Its_boxy: lmao
 Its_boxy: astro
 Its_boxy: can you tell me who ranking system works
 Astrobytes: Which part of it?
 Its_boxy: like i submitted my code and havn't got above wood 1
 MadKnight: u gain score for wins and lose score for losses
 MadKnight: ez
 Its_boxy: I rank 4 / 8569
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you have to be above the boss in points
 Astrobytes: To progress to the next league
 Its_boxy: how do i check how much points he has
 WOLFRAHH: i am in gold level in coding speed or trying to go to legend
 Astrobytes: Look on the leaderboard
 Its_boxy: 24.30&#160;??

 Its_boxy: do you guys get confused what the question is trying to ask or is it just me who is dumb
 jacek:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Its_boxy: Yes.... 
 AntiSquid: it's a puzzle that is simply featured / promoted
 Its_boxy: nice
 AntiSquid: don't assume which part of your OR conditional i said yes to, that's like missgendering someone
 Its_boxy: well i am stuck on Hourse-Racing Duals
 jacek: timeout?
 Its_boxy: i just dont get what its asking me XD
 MadKnight: to print the min difference between numbers
 jacek: i.e. [4, 2, 13, 18, 14] is 1 because 14-13 = 1
 Its_boxy: i seeeee
 Its_boxy: what is pi?
 Its_boxy: the strength
 Its_boxy: i get it

 joshau: me to
 DeclanHD: Hi I'm new here, i wanted to start learning C++ but I'm really stuck, could anybody tell me where i need to start because everything on the practice menu doesn't explain things enough 
 AntiSquid: you practice what you already know there
 MACKEYTH: Is C++ your first language?
 DeclanHD: yeah 
 MACKEYTH: How familiar are you with programming in general?
 DeclanHD: not at all haha, I couldn't really find anything to tell me what to start with
 AntiSquid: go to codesignal do the arcade section
 MACKEYTH: C++ is a useful and popular language, but I'd suggest starting with Python
 MACKEYTH: It won't get in your way as much while you're learning fundamentals
 joshau: thats weird i started with go
 MACKEYTH: Eh, YMMV
 AntiSquid: you can learn javascript which is easy on freecodecamp and you do a tutorial along with it DeclanHD
 DeclanHD: okay ill look into that, thank you for both your help
 MACKEYTH: I started with BASIC
 MACKEYTH:&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: Pascal
 ErrorRazor: Turbo Pascal was my first
 AntiSquid: but that was back in highschool, many years ago
 ErrorRazor: Same
 AntiSquid: forgot if it's hard or not as a language
 MACKEYTH: Getting back to Dec's question:
 MACKEYTH: The easy puzzles in the practice section are a good place to start.
 ErrorRazor: Yeah, once you know what standard input and output are
 MACKEYTH: Whichever language you choose
 DeclanHD: thank you
 MACKEYTH: I'm not strong on C++
 joshau: well i been doing it for a week now
 MACKEYTH: What's a good API ref for it, chat?
 legunen: &gt;_&gt;   |Round Two|  &lt;_&lt;
 joshau: '-'
 legunen: Hi
 AntiSquid: ~_~
 joshau: hello
 legunen: Who choose java language&#160;?
 joshau: i chose javascript
 legunen: Wow.
 legunen: No one choose java
 legunen: there is just javascript&#160;?
 joshau: no there is java and javascript
 legunen: Oh
 legunen: so why nobody choose java&#160;?
 legunen: I didn't find any java codingame video on youtube
 joshau: i love javascript 
 joshau:&#160;;-;
 joshau: is this app for all ages
 legunen: You use it on web development or on this game
 joshau: 23 24 25 26 its a mix
 legunen: .-. ok
 joshau: its like trix with the fix
 joshau: :metal:
 tylercmac: javascript isnt really game development focused, but web dev
 tylercmac: it can make games though.
 joshau: is that that why im flix
 AntiSquid: you can make browser games with it
 AntiSquid: and you can port JS apps to whatever suits your needs#
 joshau: fix
 joshau: [-]
 joshau:&#160;;-'
 joshau: dont ask why i put those there
 AntiSquid: i just assume something instead .
 joshau: ok
 joshau: do you now why im hyper
 AntiSquid: too much DBZ&#160;?
 joshau: nope because im younger
 joshau: dont ask 
 AntiSquid: some younger folks are more like inert objects, so have to disagree
 joshau: are you older
 joshau: i got you jk
 joshau: :joy:
 AntiSquid: did you take the vaccine&#160;?
 joshau: yep the covid vaccine
 joshau: why you asking
 AntiSquid: maybe it's a side effect
 joshau: jk i never took it jk again
 joshau: i did
 joshau: and plus its not a side effect
 AntiSquid: then you took some mood booster instead
 joshau: yep
 joshau: :worried:
 joshau: :disappointed:
 joshau: i feel like i should kill my self
 AntiSquid: um not a joking matter
 joshau: im not joking

 OoOGWAY: hey guys
 joshau: and stop eating popcorn this is not a movie jonny7
 AntiSquid: 1 xp short joshau
 joshau: yup 1 xp
 derjack: get your comment upvoted :v
 AntiSquid: yeah Jonny7 we got nobody to clean up after you
 OoOGWAY: where to learn more python?
 legunen: how to start contributing&#160;?
 Jonny7: who u doo da red doe
 AntiSquid: depends how much you already know OoOGWAY
 OoOGWAY: I had some courses before 
 AntiSquid: do puzzles, learn as you go
 joshau: how do you do loops in coding
 joshau: because i need to do algorithms
 OoOGWAY: and know I  forgot a little so.. I think I need to learn the basics again , like using the right method to code 
 OoOGWAY: which websites you recommend?
 OoOGWAY: now*
 joshau: are loops like the thing that connect the commands
 Casius01: I am not good on games today&#160;:(
 joshau: try playing games that you might remember
 joshau: i love car games and shooting games
 OoOGWAY: ok 
 OoOGWAY: thanks
 joshau: have anybody  heard of the wresler jeff hardy
 joshau: :popcorn:
 joshau: dont worry im going to clean it up
 joshau: im not like jonny7
 OoOGWAY: yeah I remember his name
 joshau: ok
 joshau: i watch wrestling every week
 OoOGWAY: I used to do so , but now I don't
 joshau: why
 OoOGWAY: it got boring 
 joshau: oh ok
 Jonny7: Haha sorry joshau
 joshau: its ok jonny7
 joshau: its just that you need to clean up behide yourself nobody is going to do it for you
 Jonny7: depends on the language, how you loop. It's usually something likefor (thing x in list) {
 joshau: ok
 Jonny7: which will run the code 'doSomething' for each item 'x' in a list of items.
 Jonny7: doSomething is a block of code defined somewhere else, which you call by a name, to keep the flow of your code clean and easy to read
 Jonny7: Happy to help you get started if you have an example of something you want to do
 joshau: wow your a genius
 joshau: thanks
 Jonny7: Haha thanks, been working in the industry for 7 years&#160;;-)
 joshau: what!
 joshau: thats amazing
 Jonny7:&#160;:)
 jacek: oh my
 AntiSquid: plenty of time to master for loops, right Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is there a limit on how many people in the league
 AntiSquid: just joking, ignore me
 Jonny7: lol is that a bot?
 jacek: AutomatonNN isnt bot
 AntiSquid: am i&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: code is so slow
 Jonny7: haha
 jacek: why AutomatonNN isnt called AutomatonMLP
 AutomatonNN: what is the "silect" content solution&#160;?

 Rival819: IIIIII WOOOONNNNN
 Rival819: FINALLLY
 Rival819: I literally crushed that pod :D
 Rival819: and found it myself after hours of scrathing my head
 Rival819: so proud
 Rival819: I ranked 1505 :D
 NDC95: no idea what I am doing 
 Rival819: its hard for begginers like me
 Rival819: I litteraly fell alseep twice on this one
 Rival819: and juste by tryin and reading it over and over and over 
 Rival819: finally got it right
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: same, i am always having a hard time, even though all my friends say that i am really good at this.. sadly that is not true, because they just are bad at it...
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: right now, i am trying to get to get to the top 1000 in clash of code
 Tiouz: It is probably because that you don't have this particular knowledge. Optimization problems will require to know LNS, SA, and algorithms like that
 Rival819: for me whats working his learning mutiple random stuff and playing with it until I finaly really understand it
 Rival819: and it worked
 Rival819: to my amazement just 10 minutes ago
 Rival819: :D
 Rival819: I destroyed that boss 2 and ranked 1505 hehe going bronze have to twak this dude
 Rival819: tweak
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: same, i try to collect code from ppl who are better than me, and i just try to master it
 Rival819: I dont...looking at other code are just to advanced formulas for me yet
 Rival819: it confuses me
 Rival819: I keep it simple
 Rival819: and tried to use simple ways
 Rival819: and it worked
 Tiouz: It depends on what you want to achieve
 Rival819: flawlessly :D
 Rival819: true
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: it is confussing at first, but when you get it, your level of understanding get super hi.. like from loser to hero
 jacek: i randomly try things until they work
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhh
 Tiouz: If you want to get better in a language, look at solutions (important for golfing), otherwise, just play, and maybe check algorithms if you don't know them
 Rival819: yes I just got illuminated
 Rival819: I was not understanding the way how of to print the code the good way
 Rival819: now I get it
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: @Tiouz true
 Rival819: and will never forget
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: great
 Rival819: using C# for unity
 Rival819: :D
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: oh cool
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i always wanted to play with unity
 Rival819: I dont know any language but recognize and firentiate them most
 Rival819: differentiate *
 Rival819: that was a mouthful
 Rival819: and now I seem to understand one good hehe finally....its just the beggining though time to go suffer
 Rival819: but im happy :D
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i know a little about many languages, and i know alot about one language "javascript"&#160;:)
 Rival819: javascript users seemed do be having problems with bug in here from post I read
 Rival819: I know from time to time I have to resfresh my page
 Rival819: or code will run but game not move
 Rival819: simple glitch
 Rival819: but at first was confusing has hell
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i see
 Rival819: god bless my tech skillz
 Rival819: im not programmer yet but ima very great tech hehe
 Rival819: programming was my scare
 Rival819: but I learned 3D and blender very fast
 Rival819: so now...
 Rival819: need C#
 Rival819: grinding
 Rival819: xD
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: you should call yourself a junior game dev
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: not just a tech
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: a super tech
 Rival819: I dont feel like I have the right too yet sir but thx for the honor lemme go cry now :D
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhhhhhhhhh
 Rival819: hahhaha
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: you killed me
 Rival819: :P
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: anyways clash time
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: later&#160;:)
 Rival819: have a good one
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: thx
 Rival819: back to tweaking my champion pod
 Rival819: :D
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: :thumbsup:
 Rival819: yay new rank
 Rival819: unlocked boost
 Rival819: ^^
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: good luck
 Tiouz: Oh, I have the highest rank in 2048 in python users&#160;!
 Rival819: im now 4,712th bronze league in CSB, from 10 hour stuck not understanding to there in 30 min :D
 Rival819: gratz my man :D
 Tiouz: CSB is juste good heuristics and vectors (at least to get to gold)
 therealbeef: if you like CSB, you can also try Search Race (in optimization). it's the same just without opponent, and you can go faster. good to tweak your steering
 Tiouz: I had so much more trouble with Search Race than CSB. The speed is really insane in SR
 therealbeef: all drift&#160;;)
 Tiouz: My simple heuristics for CSB&#160;didn't apply (or I&#160;had to tweak them a lot)
 Tiouz: That 'Tokyo Drift' test is so fun
 therealbeef: i like the Hold the Line; never manage to get three perfect laps

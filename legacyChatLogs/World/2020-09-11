 UnTenseUnJury: hio
 Q12: I am trying to put spaces between numbers in the statement of contribution to make them look like there are in grid but when I click send It's like erasing all the spaces I put except for one between each number. Can somebody help me?
 DeWill: Are doing from mobile...?
 Q12: No
 daffie: maybe check the tab spacing / smart indent settings
 daffie: or the auto format settings
 sugam: in the contest do we play one bot programming game for 7 days? 
 MadKnight: yea
 MadKnight: with no sleep 
 MadKnight: no distractions
 sugam: so we take 7 days to optimize the bot of the same distraction
 sugam: game*
 sugam: same game*
 MadKnight: to improve*
 MadKnight: yea 7 days of bot improvements
 rivancic: what no sleep? Count me in!!  :coffee:
 rivancic: What is the prize for this?
 sugam: $500 lol 
 Ryanless: so i am trying to get the 2 clashes in 3 min achiev... somehow i always take longer
 sugam: I- just wanna solve the problem...
 cydrus: is it considered cheating if you look at the algorithm or pseudocode in the hints?
 Uljahn: it is considered learning
 cydrus: ok thanks I thought I was cheating since i didn't know how to solve the problem :D
 Uljahn: those hints are official, besides there are too few of them
 krolik: I kept seeing same avatars in CoC and thought "wow, these guys must also not have a life like me", and then i learned about CoC bots
 c0nc4c: have anyone done the thor quiz?
 Netsos: yes
 c0nc4c: lol i read the hint
 c0nc4c: i know where i'm wrong now
 c0nc4c: freaking i feel like cheating 
 Netsos: just like he said 'it is considered learning' Its normal for beginners to read the hint, even i did
 Uljahn: exactly
 x544D: guys Can we join **CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2020**  as a team&#160;?

 TheSilent_Boy: HI
 ThunderbirdOne: hey guys, how are things around here these days? :D
 Astrobytes: Yo stranger! Yeah, just the usual&#160;:)
 ThunderbirdOne: no massive influx cuz of covid or anything?
 ThunderbirdOne: noticed the main page got a nice refresher
 ThunderbirdOne: with the learning paths and all
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's a quest map and stuff, click on it to get stuff
 ThunderbirdOne: already have :D
 ThunderbirdOne: free XP, huzzah!
 Astrobytes: Unofficial contest starting tomorrow, next official one in November 
 ThunderbirdOne: oh hmm.. not sure I can make it xD
 ThunderbirdOne: we have a litter of pups atm... they're a handful lol
 Astrobytes: Ah awesome
 Astrobytes: Yeah, hard work
 marawanmo: learning paths&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hm?
 marawanmo: where&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Click back to home
 Astrobytes: There's a Quest Map
 marawanmo: i must be blind lol do u mean codingame/traning&#160;?
 marawanmo: oh nvm
 marawanmo: its a home icon
 Astrobytes: Got it?
 marawanmo: yeah thanks
 Astrobytes: no problem
 eulerscheZahl: oh, ThunderbirdOne!
 eulerscheZahl: welcome back
 TheSilent_Boy: hi
 TheSilent_Boy: I am seeing you second time here I guess?
 AntiSquid: unofficial contest must be troll vs castles
 AntiSquid: i figured that's the perfect release date and there's a hint on their discord server: "no trolling allowed"
 Scarfield: it was mentioned it being an old multi right?
 MadKnight: yea
 Scarfield: thought so, joining maddy?
 Scarfield: with disjointed MCTS or how you called it :D
 AntiSquid: and then realize the selected game doesn't have simultaneous turns
 MadKnight: then it's just MCTS
 MadKnight: what's the problem Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i have a ton of time
 Scarfield: thats some heavy time 
 AntiSquid: did anyone else try the darpa contest at all? 
 Scarfield: nope, bought Factorio a few weeks ago, that was some heavt time
 Scarfield: heavy *
 AntiSquid: heavy in what way?
 AntiSquid: heavier than handling several docker images?
 Scarfield: handling several docker images?
 Scarfield: but i spent a ton of time on it, that kind of heavy
 AntiSquid: ah o
 AntiSquid: ok
 Hjax: factorio is the most addictive drug in the world for engineers 
 AntiSquid: did you join a random team on reply challenges euler?
 AntiSquid: eulerscheZahl
 Hjax: it really should be regulated :P 
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't registered yet
 eulerscheZahl: usually I ask illedan - if he doesn't ask me before
 gsomix: Hjax, nah, if you are an engineer than Factorio feels like, you know, work.&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: do they have a forum or something? trying to avoid random queue of inactive people lol
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know
 eulerscheZahl: success: if you want to beat me, you have to beat Illedan too
 AntiSquid: you aren't registered, win by default
 eulerscheZahl: struggling with the login and passwort reset&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: worked for me, had to add special character to password 
 eulerscheZahl: finally
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i made a typo while resetting it
 Vyper1209: I dunno how to increase amount of water :v
 AntiSquid: open the tap a bit more
 jacek: add more hydrogen and oxygen
 Scarfield: visit r/hydrohomies
 eulerscheZahl: r/lipophimies
 AntiSquid: r/watchredditdie
 Vyper1209: ugh...
 Vyper1209: I try but it doesn't increase
 Vyper1209: The amount of water
 AntiSquid: do a rain dance
 Scarfield: xD
 Vyper1209: :v
 Vyper1209: Although they explain the variable 'water' and I try to double it but nothing happen :v
 jacek: ask derpy for clouds
 Scarfield: having trouble with a puzzle? ask a specific question (puzzle name, language, issue ...), and someone could help you&#160;:)
 Vyper1209: Well, I use C# and I try to increase the amount of water
 jacek: dont let the water around the iron or itll be rust
 Vyper1209: ugh... i understand a bit :v

 Moctrof: Kill me before it's too late
 darkhorse64: Nice! Heuristics&#160;? Search&#160;?
 Moctrof: Luck
 darkhorse64: The key for Legend is a timely strike
 Moctrof: I simulate the next 8 steps randomly and keep the one with  the score max in one turn because I want to do a big strike yeah 
 Moctrof: But I am still in Silver
 eulerscheZahl:    but the general idea is fine
 Moctrof: Maybe I will try not so randomly
 eulerscheZahl: how many random plans can you evaluate?
 Moctrof: Not a lot it's not optimized at all
 eulerscheZahl: depending how much "not a lot" is, that's where you should start
 charlesCabage: dani
 Moctrof: around 1000
 charlesCabage: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://grabify.link/EYY11K">https://grabify.link/EYY11K</a>
 eulerscheZahl: with that few sims it might even be better to reduce search depth. don't simulate all 8 stones but maybe 6
 Moctrof: Ah yeah maybe that's better
 Moctrof: Usually the other guy attack me before 8 anyway
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you try to build a tower in the center and don't have everything at the same height, these smaller attacks are harmless
 Moctrof: Ah... I was trying to reduce the height ^^ 
 eulerscheZahl: reducing height is bad
 eulerscheZahl: stones are needed to build attacks
 eulerscheZahl: don't waste them
 charlesCabage: 	173.252.95.29 is dis some ones ip?
 Moctrof: Didn't think of that ^^ You are good
 Moctrof: By the way I stole your timer in Mars Lander ahah 
 charlesCabage: us newark? huh
 charlesCabage: nvr mind
 SimplyRekt: man probably just leaked his own ip bruh
 eulerscheZahl: nah, IP is from Chicago
 eulerscheZahl: but you can have my IP127.0.0.1
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: you can move from Nepal to Chicago though
 charlesCabage: some one here is using vpn 37.120.129.107. 
 charlesCabage: your battery is 44% plz charge it
 charlesCabage: nvr mind that was someone else
 Moctrof: hacker
 Moctrof: can you hack my girlfriend
 eulerscheZahl: kiddy writing nonsense
 Moctrof: nvm I don't have girlfriend
 charlesCabage: lmao
 MadKnight:  EXPERT rotationAngle thrust message is rotationAngle relative&#160;?
 Moctrof: if it goes to the right
 Moctrof: relative&#160;? I read negative
 Moctrof: Can I delete my messages&#160;:(
 MadKnight: lol
 MadKnight: no u can't, it will stay forever
 MadKnight: and the Automaton NNs will learn on it
 Moctrof: Wait 
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 have u learned it yet&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and tomorrow you can find it here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=World%2F&amp;namespace=3000">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=World%2F&amp;namespace=3000</a>
 Automaton2000: have you tried turning it off and on again?
 Moctrof: Automaton2000 are you a bot&#160;?
 Automaton2000: how would you know it
 Moctrof: it's crazy
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that almost sounds like a real conversation this time
 Moctrof: What's your name Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: cant wait for the end
 eulerscheZahl: not like the glibberish from AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: be finally solved it with a game with a contest on the left
 Moctrof: lol
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN can we be friends&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: &lt;3
 Scarfield: xD
 Moctrof: This is how the love story began
 AntiSquid: if the sentences are generic enough to work in most situations sure ... 
 Morbid: hi
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN are you clever
 Scarfield: hey
 Moctrof:&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 Morbid: :3
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that again :rofl:
 AntiSquid: text stab :o
 Moctrof: wtf
 Morbid: what?
 eulerscheZahl: fancy unicode
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN do it again
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same sample in the contest?
 Moctrof: true
 AntiSquid: we should ban Automaton2020 somehow, it ruins the autocomplete
 eulerscheZahl: who is that 2020 even? is that dbdr's chat log?
 MadKnight: Automaton2020
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN est ce que tu parles francais ici&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: skyro just saying that it's good
 AntiSquid: you can talk to him in french on #fr 
 Moctrof: Yeah I did
 eulerscheZahl: or #ru
 AntiSquid: i mean keep this chat english
 AntiSquid: and only mado would write french in ru chat, don't do that
 MSmits: is euler trying to troll Ru-channel with French speakers?
 eulerscheZahl: did my Moctrof cocktail work?
 eulerscheZahl: Molotov*
 MSmits: lol
 Moctrof: I put one message 
 Moctrof: You managed
 MadKnight: oh no Automaton2000 we got french invaders! run for your bot life!
 Automaton2000: but it's the best way to do that?
 Hjax: does Automaton take the message that triggered it as input? 
 MadKnight: yes Automaton2000 running is the best way
 Automaton2000: i have problems printing my solutions in js once they are stored in a container since they dont presve always ...
 MadKnight: it takes everything as input, Hjax
 SimplyRekt: LOL someone wrote that?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think the pinging message is taken into account when generating a response
 Hjax: probably not exactly that 
 MadKnight: no it generates messages from words
 eulerscheZahl: it's on github, you can check it&#160;;)
 SimplyRekt: that's pretty funny
 Hjax: i was under the impression it was easier to get it to mention you euler if you said "euler" in the pinging message somewhere
 Hjax: but maybe thats just confirmation bias
 eulerscheZahl: still my favorite automaton quote <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/stoEY06">https://imgur.com/a/stoEY06</a>
 SimplyRekt: i've gotta make one of these as a discord bot now
 Hjax: Automaton2000 can you mention euler?
 Automaton2000: so maybe it will be a big deal
 Hjax: maybe not :D 
 eulerscheZahl: the NN one is a specialist on that
 eulerscheZahl: or was at least
 eulerscheZahl: got better
 Hjax: AutomatonNN are you an euler fan?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN ARE YOU AN EULER FAN&#160;?
 Hjax: is it possible for automaton to mention itself? 
 AutomatonNN: Bye
 Moctrof: lolll
 Hjax: you scared it off 
 MSmits: thats your favorite quote euler? Mine is when he said you are a noob :P
 eulerscheZahl: that was just mean
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: but also funny&#160;:)
 MadKnight: MSmits how's september going for u&#160;?
 MSmits: busy, started working at my new house today 
 MSmits: I have about 2 weeks to do everything before I actually move
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN can you fogive me&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: why do you have the test cases?
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN Yes
 AutomatonNN: hi
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN hi how are you&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: but there is no such thing as i did
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN ANSWER THE QUESTION JERK
 AutomatonNN: so you can change that for code of kutulu
 MSmits: AutomatonNN there is no try, only ...
 AutomatonNN: Where is the code for the coders strike back?
 MSmits: worst quote finish ever
 Hjax: lol
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN Are you my new boss&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN I am looking  for a job
 AutomatonNN: We can't find a time on the problem with that game
 MSmits: AutomatonNN Moctrof is your new biological servant
 AutomatonNN: for what i want to do in the contest i didn't even know it was a good idea
 MSmits: fully carbon-based
 Moctrof: lol
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN What do you want to do with my body&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same code?
 USE-TO: GUYS! WHERE IS PYTHON3.8?!
 Hjax: not on this site :P 
 USE-TO: WHY?!
 Hjax: you want to use the walrus operator that badly? 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/</a>
 USE-TO: I need it
 USE-TO: xD
 USE-TO: I want it!
 USE-TO: I take it!
 Hjax: theres a lot of things that would be nice to have on this site 
 Hjax: graalvm, pypy
 Hjax: pypy would make python at least slightly competitive 
 MSmits: we only have py
 Hjax: i wrote a bitboard connect for program in python once
 Hjax: four*
 MSmits: 2*"py" = "pypy"
 Hjax: pypy was like 10x faster 
 Hjax: also wrote checkers in python 
 MSmits: does it compile to a different language?
 MSmits: precompiled stuff or something?
 Hjax: no, its just an optimized JIT
 MSmits: interpreter? No compiling?
 Hjax: correct
 Hjax: well, it compiles while it interprets 
 Hjax: "just in time" :D 
 MSmits: do you mean what java and C# do?
 MSmits: because those have real compilation
 MSmits: just not fully
 Hjax: java compiles to class files first 
 Hjax: pypy doesnt compile 
 MSmits: hm ok
 Hjax: you just do "pypy script.py" and enjoy a massive speedup 
 MSmits: I see
 Schwase: private clashes dont contribute to your rank correct?
 Hjax: " If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy" - guido van rossum, the creator of python
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: so whats the downside of pypy
 Hjax: some libraries dont work 
 MSmits: if there was no downside, it would be the default for running python
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: so you lose flexibility somehow
 MSmits: the interpreter does less interpreting I am guessing
 MSmits: which makes it faster
 Hjax: also generally the development of pypy lags behind cpython 
 Hjax: so you get new features later
 MSmits: whats the c for
 MSmits: lightspeed?
 Hjax: cpython is the name for the vanilla standard python 
 Hjax: written in...... c :D 
 MSmits: aha
 Hjax: not to be confused with cython
 MSmits: I wasnt confused
 Hjax: which is some pythony compiled language that no one uses 
 MSmits: am now
 Hjax: :D 
 MSmits: and what is pythony
 Hjax: an adjective i made up on the spot 
 MSmits: pythonish?
 Astrobytes: *pythonesque
 MSmits: nice one
 Hjax: i would use python on codingame a lot more if pypy was supported 
 MSmits: I probably would use it just as much
 Hjax: right now its only good for heuristic games
 MSmits: it's never gonna be faster than c++ or rust anyway
 Hjax: (like PR2, which is why my PR2 is python)
 MSmits: so if I want fast, i want fastest
 MSmits: how does pypy compare with C#?
 MSmits: in speed
 MSmits: still slower?
 MSmits: cuz python is magnitudes slower than C# without pypy
 Hjax: i would guess pypy is slightly slower 
 Hjax: not massively 
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: thats nice
 jacek: try pypypypypypypypypypy
 MSmits: so basically, you use pypy if you're more used to python than to C#
 MSmits: I'm equally used to both I think
 MSmits: so would still prefer C#
 jacek: ironpython?
 Hjax: i am trying to make rust my main language for these coding competition things
 Hjax: python is slow as dirt, and ive been screwed by garbage collection one too many times in java
 Hjax: having to intentionally write java in such a way that you minimize garbage is annoying
 jacek: meh rust. when theyre gonna fix debug ide
 Hjax: ^ that would certainly be nice 
 jacek: the mysterious content starts tomorrow eh
 jacek: in Caturday
 uvBoss: yea
 Hjax: are you going to play jacek? 
 Hjax: ive noticed you dont seem to play contests
 Hjax: despite being really good at multis 
 jacek: mostly board games
 MSmits: jacek is really good at board games at leas
 MSmits: especially since he figured out NN's
 sendhelp: oo
 jacek: ill see what game is it, probably get to the bronze and lose interest
 MSmits: I'll probably get legend if I have enough time and interest. I don't think I get obsessed enough anymore to get into top 10
 sugam: jacek's message is a mood
 Hjax: my odds of winning an unofficial contest are significantly better than my odds of winning an official one 
 Hjax: so if the game looks fun ill probably spend a lot of time on my submission 
 jacek: the bribery should be easier
 Hjax: :P
 AntiSquid: what if there is no bronze&#160;?
 AntiSquid: could be a community game
 MSmits: I dont think they use the same system as that
 MSmits: either it's a 1-league game or they use the wood/bronze etc.
 Hjax: i think its unlikely to be a community game
 Albab: yeah
 Hjax: because they are less beginner friendly in general 
 MSmits: mmh depends a lot on the creator
 MSmits: some community games had easy starts
 MSmits: community contest games I mean
 MSmits: Mean max for example
 Hjax: inb4 pr2 again
 MSmits: I thought code ala mode was pretty easy too
 MSmits: just a lot of work to get all the recipes in
 MSmits: first leagues only 1 or 2 recipes
 Hjax: that game is kind of interesting just because its coop
 MSmits: yea
 jacek: meh, im antisocial
 MSmits: we know :P
 jacek: and so are my bots
 Hjax: huh top2 are python 3 
 MSmits: heuristic game Hjax
 Hjax: heuristics all the way i guess
 Hjax: yeah 
 MSmits: mine has beamsearch
 MSmits: but I have so many heuristics in the beamsearch, I might as well have removed the search entirely
 MSmits: 300 if-count
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: more ifs than lines of code in my PR2
 jacek: you only need 1 if: if winningMove: doIt() else: cry()
 uvBoss: xD
 Hjax: i keep scrolling through the multi list trying to guess what the game is going to be
 jacek: :newspaper: :soccer:
 Hjax: you wish 
 eulerscheZahl: Vindinium
 eulerscheZahl: got community game standards it's if-else-able
 eulerscheZahl:  /s/got/for
 jacek: or othello. i miss those days when this was the only topic
 Hjax: i learned recently that vindinium was created by the guy who made lichess 
 eulerscheZahl: ornicar
 Hjax: yeah 
 shashwat986: :s/got/for
 Hjax: lichess is fantastic, literally the best chess server and its completely free
 eulerscheZahl: i can't comment on that, i don't play chess
 Hjax: i do, but im not particularly good 
 eulerscheZahl: i know the rules
 jacek: do you always know when en passant occures?
 Hjax: im roughly 50th percentile on lichess i believe 
 Hjax: so average 
 AntiSquid: what makes lichess better?
 AntiSquid: it's still just chess no?
 Hjax: it has lots of free features that other sites charge for 
 Hjax: like computer analysis of your games 
 reCurse: Oh that's interesting trivia, had no idea
 Hjax: and has a really clean, user friendly UI 
 eulerscheZahl: the vindinium-lichess part?
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: I like lichess, it has anonymous play :p
 eulerscheZahl: he even said that lichess takes some effort and he won't support vindinium anymore for that reason (including server bills)
 Astrobytes: +1 on anonymous play lol
 AntiSquid: PR2 only official multi without legend eh&#160;?
 jacek: do people really chess pla nowadays without aid of computer
 reCurse: I really dislike the monetization-in-your-face of chess.com so lichess is theoretically better
 AntiSquid: oh there's BTTC, guess that's the contest
 reCurse: And yes, obviously
 AntiSquid: just random arbitrary guess
 reCurse: Like any competition there's always some cheaters
 jacek: BTC?
 MSmits: back to the code
 AntiSquid: back to the code
 jacek: oh
 MSmits: too slow
 jacek: :ie:
 jacek: :hmm:
 reCurse: I'd really like to play blitz but I'm stuck on rapid, my old brain is too slow
 Hjax: both chess.com and lichess have cheater detection 
 AntiSquid: i was faster but CG is closer to your country MSmits
 MSmits: nice excuse :P
 Hjax: they will even refund rating points that you lost to a cheater 
 eulerscheZahl: how does cheater detection even work?
 reCurse: Accuracy
 Hjax: comparison to computer moves 
 reCurse: Someone playing extremely accurate moves and extreme blunders is suspicious
 MSmits: mmh thats my tactic in most games
 AntiSquid: except there are some disputes where they banned the wrong people
 reCurse: It's like aimbotting, hard to describe but easy to point out
 reCurse: Sure, nothing's perfect
 Hjax: occasionally a top player will get flagged for cheating 
 AntiSquid: but usually you can probably compare to most popular chess engines
 Hjax: just because they play so well the computer cant tell the difference
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you need some chess experience to detect it
 reCurse: But unless you play at the GM level it's not an issue
 charlesCabage: sugam? you there?
 reCurse: A non-titled player using an engine should be very easy to spot
 MSmits: mmh what if you wrote the chess engine yourself from scratch
 reCurse: Doesn't matter
 charlesCabage: does any one know a good site to learn python 3 for free
 eulerscheZahl: there's even a bot section on lichess
 MSmits: mmh ok
 AntiSquid: might be a new 12 year old magnus carlsen who gets angry over the ban and quits chess&#160;! :p
 Hjax: even a crappy chess engine will find some really insane tactics that a human wouldnt 
 reCurse: ^
 MSmits: that's really dependent on the game right? How hard it is to write an AI that easily beats humans
 reCurse: Of course
 charlesCabage: i want to learn python 3 can any one help me get started. what site should i look at
 MSmits: i mean for simple board games even
 MSmits: not just dota 
 AntiSquid: charlesCabage an awful lot of sites out there to learn python, none of the top of my head, stop spamming though please
 AntiSquid: sololearn maybe
 AntiSquid: google is best 
 AntiSquid: since you can tailor to your needs
 charlesCabage: ok
 reCurse: If humans aren't anywhere near the skill level of engines then it becomes easy to see when one is playing at a superhuman level, thereforce suspicious
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish">https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish</a> heres a chess engine in 100 lines of python thats significantly better than most of lichess's player base 
 reCurse: If it matches the engine too much then it's no longer luck
 Hjax: its just minimax with a piece square table 
 Uljahn: what if you cheat by choosing the second or third best move? :thinking:
 reCurse: If it doesn't, then you have an extremely skilled player making newbie blunders
 MSmits: reCurse unless it's a new engine playing differently and not very good (just enough to beat everyone on the site)
 AntiSquid: actually github has an awful lot of tutorials for any language too charlesCabage
 reCurse: Uljahn: Still detectable if you look at the accuracy curve
 reCurse: It should be standard pattern recognition
 AntiSquid: you can be GM playing from home with computer aid, that's true, one of the controversies out there 
 MSmits: Uljahn also, sometimes the 2nd best move is a horrible move
 Hjax: computers have somewhat more predictable time management than humans too 
 Hjax: if you take exactly 10 seconds every move, probably cheating 
 VeryProfessionalVeryNice: imagine if people actually shared their code after a clash
 jacek: thats the next step for ai challenge: make 'weak' bot that blunders more humanly
 reCurse: Or by extension, not immediately answering to obvious moves
 MSmits: easily mitigated too Hjax
 MSmits: you can just randomize it
 MSmits: obvious moves are also detectible
 Hjax: do you think many cheaters will do whats necessary to avoid detection? 
 reCurse: It's hard to tell, I'm not even that good but I could tell the exact moment my opponent switched to an engine once
 reCurse: And he got banned 1-2 hours later
 MSmits: I think if you really really put in an effort to beat the detection system, you could
 Enknable: why not just use ML classifier to know the difference between human players and bots
 Hjax: im sure people cheat and get away with it, but most dont 
 reCurse: Yes that's definitely a good approach Enknable
 Hjax: and therefore its a good deterrent 
 reCurse: I'm sure they already do that
 AntiSquid: just use ... outliers Enknable, they always exist
 reCurse: It seems like a textbook case of ML
 reCurse: Flag them and manual review
 reCurse: Should be easy
 reCurse: Harder for GMs naturally
 reCurse: Makes it safe for 99.9% of us
 AntiSquid: they could secretly put a chess engine vs you to check whether you beat 3.5k MMR :D
 AntiSquid: wait forgot what the ranking points are called in chess
 Hjax: i found a reddit post talking about lichess cheating detection, apparently it also checks the browsers focus 
 reCurse: It's quite an interesting topic, would have been fun to do it before they existed
 Hjax: tabbing out after each of your opponents moves is pretty fishy 
 jacek: stockfishy
 Hjax: zing
 MSmits: btw the mentioning of magnus carlsen reminds me of this documentary I saw about rubiks cube competitors. Did you guys see that one? It was on netflix
 MSmits: i think it was
 Hjax: i heard about it, it follows two cubers right 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it was pretty cool
 Enknable: 2**3'errs
 Hjax: one is feliks zemdegs 
 MSmits: yeah
 Hjax: the greatest of all time cuber
 MSmits: not exactly
 Hjax: idk the other one 
 MSmits: the other guy was better
 MSmits: he beat felix in almost every category
 AntiSquid: 2 machines ... automated script reading screen and just displaying info on the side of best moves
 AntiSquid: replying to browser focus
 Hjax: feliks won the world championship twice
 MSmits: this guy won many times also
 Hjax: he doesnt have the fastest solve anymore 
 Hjax: but he did for a long time 
 AntiSquid: rubik's cube competitors are real life human bots . no point discussing further
 Hjax: i can solve in like, 90 seconds 
 Hjax: world record is like....... 4 seconds
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/clock/single">https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/clock/single</a>
 MSmits: max park it was
 MSmits: if you select a bunch of categories, you see his name at the top a bunch of time
 MSmits: yeah i cant solve one I think
 MSmits: never learned the algorithms
 MSmits: maybe I can solve it Monte carlo style
 AntiSquid: 3.2 seconds? see&#160;? real bots
 MSmits: these guys learn 100+ algorithms
 MSmits: they inspect the cube and then decide which one to apply
 Hjax: i know the "beginners method" 
 Hjax: you solve layer by layer 
 MSmits: ah ok
 Hjax: you only need to know like 6 algorithms 
 MSmits: I solved one by following a webpage once
 MSmits: I was very impressed
 MSmits: i just did what it said
 Hjax: gods number for 3x3 is 20 
 Hjax: every cube state can be solved in 20 moves or less 
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: the speed of these guys too
 MSmits: there is a 1-handed categorie
 MSmits: and they still do it in a few seconds
 Hjax: i have a friend who was a pretty good one handed solver
 eulerscheZahl: blindfolded is what impresses me most
 Hjax: took him like 20 seconds or so 
 MSmits: right that too
 w-kosse: hiya
 Hjax: this friend is also colorblind, which i thought was interesting 
 MSmits: i guess not color blind enough, if you can see shades well enough, it's doable

 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 jacek: i can only solve this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://rubiks.fandom.com/wiki/1x1x1">https://rubiks.fandom.com/wiki/1x1x1</a>
 MSmits: I think when you code a lot and keep seeing the amazing things a few lines of code can do, you sometimes forget how amazing the brain is
 MSmits: me too jacek
 MSmits: pretty sure i can do 2x2x2 also
 Hjax: im sure you can solve the 2x2, no algorithms required 
 Hjax: lol from some cubing website 
 Hjax: "The 2x2x2 Rubik’s cube (called the Pocket Cube) has 3674160 combinations. This is a manageable number. If you fiddle with the 2x2x2 cube randomly, eight hours a day continuously, you’ll solve it by pure chance roughly two or three times per year."
 MSmits: nvm
 MSmits: I can't solve it
 AntiSquid: discussion reminds me of:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HG45nykx00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HG45nykx00</a>
 AntiSquid: no, actually it was a different video with much bigger cube
 Astrobytes: my colour blindness doesn't affect me solving a cube in the slightest
 Astrobytes: my lack of skill does
 Hjax: lol
 Doggednamed1: Hello. I am new.
 Astrobytes: Hello new.
 Astrobytes: I am Astrobytes.
 Schwase: hey i made a classic puzzle contribution that is a shortest path cubic chess puzzle, its a couple of weeks into being in the pending approval stage and id appreciate anyone who would take just a little time to check it out
 jacek: rubik cube + chess?
 Schwase: oh damn thats actually a cool idea lol
 Schwase: i have no clue how it would work
 Schwase: but it sounds cool
 Enknable: each cube is a chessboard
 Enknable: and you have to win to spin
 Schwase: each cube is a cubic chess board
 jacek: sounds like ultimate tic tac toe  + rubik cube
 Enknable: ^
 reCurse: Or just go full chaos and play 5d chess
 eulerscheZahl: finally a game that needs a 3D library
 Hjax: 6 chess boards, you can rotate pieces between them using rubiks cube moves
 eulerscheZahl: down with PIXI
 eulerscheZahl: oddly enough that three.js even took less CPU resources than pixi
 Schwase: i changed the name because i had the puzzle named after the german name for cubic chess and i dont think it was helping to gain traction
 Schwase: also, full disclosure, im 1 upvote from 5 and kind of an achievement whore haha
 eulerscheZahl: that quest map promotes quantity over quality&#160;:/
 reCurse: Asking for upvotes makes me want to instinctively downvote :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: and don't forget to subscribe and support me on patreon
 Astrobytes: I regard it as poor form to 'advertise' one's contributions in chat
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 jacek: hm?
 Hjax: dont forget to smash that like button!
 Astrobytes: Not you jacek, you can advertise paper soccer all you like :P
 AntiSquid: if the hit like request upsets you a lot why not make a fake copyright claim on their video&#160;? lol
 Enknable: just write a bot that downvotes through proxies
 Schwase: you could have messaged me privately and asked me not to do that again but message received. 
 AntiSquid: contest starts in 5 minutes according to the forum thread
 jacek: huh
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/autumn-ai-2020/186331">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/autumn-ai-2020/186331</a>
 Astrobytes: Schwase: not an issue, just my personal opinion. People will get to your contribution, just gotta be patient&#160;:)
 Hjax: huh, what do you know, the contest starts in 5 minutes 
 MSmits: Schwase I don't mind you asking for people to check it out really. As long as you dont spam it, it doesn't seem that bad. Also it makes it less bad if you ask after being in conversation for a while
 MSmits: if you just pop up to advertise it feels different
 Schwase: ive been in world for a few hours now...
 MSmits: plenty of times we discussed a contribution by euler or someone else here. Usually just because it came up, but that also advertises it
 MSmits: yeah I am not criticizing
 MSmits: I am just saying this in general
 MSmits: it's the same with clashes
 Doggednamed1: Hey, on the Temperatures exercise, I don't understand it.
 MSmits: people are annoyed when someone advertises a clash
 MSmits: but if clashes have been discussed for a while and then someone says, let's do one, it's fine
 Schwase: yeah ive seen that too
 Hjax: Doggednamed1 whats wrong? you dont understand the problem statement? 
 Doggednamed1: Will someone explain it to me?
 MSmits: it's a "read the room" kind of thing I guess
 Hjax: you are given a list of numbers, you must pick the one that is closest to 0, if theres a positive and a negative number that are the same distance from 0, pick the positive one
 Doggednamed1: Ok.
 MSmits: -1,-2,1, 15
 MSmits: which one is it Doggednamed1
 <b>**MSmits thinks Doggednamed1's brain does not allow pypy</b></p><p><img src="/a/48188548284698" /> Schwase: gtg i have a quantum lecture
 jacek: pepe?
 Doggednamed1: 1?
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits: now code it&#160;:)
 Doggednamed1: Where?
 MSmits: in the IDE
 jacek: print("1")
 MSmits: where you can type the code
 MSmits: the codey thingy
 Doggednamed1: Oh.
 Doggednamed1: I understand now.
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: it takes some getting used to
 MSmits: stick with it if you enjoy it and it'll become easier
 MSmits: aw :poop: someone said quantum and i didnt respond
 Enknable: you did respond in some dimension
 Enknable: so dont worry
 MSmits: ahh yeah, that's a great excuse to stay in bed in the morning
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 jacek: i found perfect decoration for your walls, MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/agA4E8q_460svvp9.webm">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/agA4E8q_460svvp9.webm</a>
 Hjax: seems the contest actually starts 12 hours from now 
 eulerscheZahl: "contest"
 Hjax: discord says 7 am on the 12th, UTC
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i'll keep writing it like that
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: if the game is vindinium will you remove the quotes
 Astrobytes: When is your one eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not approved yet
 Hjax: whats this?
 eulerscheZahl: if it will take place, probably january
 Hjax: community contest? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 Hjax: exciting 
 eulerscheZahl: game is finished for a while already
 AntiSquid: should make a poll see who is right
 eulerscheZahl: but not gonna happen before the next official contest
 AntiSquid: next contest spoiled by the creator .
 Astrobytes: Shame we didn't have a summer contest, official or not
 AntiSquid: like it was no big deal .
 Enknable:&#160;? AntiSquid
 Hjax: time to hack eulers github and get a head start
 Astrobytes: I don't follow
 eulerscheZahl: who spoiled what?
 eulerscheZahl: my game is on github btw (private repo)
 Hjax: good&#160;;)
 Enknable: in C++ i'm implicitly copying structs that have pointers...but it's copying the actual data stored in the pointers (its what i want) but I've been reading it should only copy the address
 Enknable: Did I read something wrong or is this the expected behavior?
 jacek: wheres struct
 eulerscheZahl: missing
 eulerscheZahl: last reaction i got from him:&#160;:+1: in july 15th :sob:
 MSmits: wow jacek, you're right
 MSmits: perfect decoration

 AntiSquid: he linked wrong time
 Hjax: actually starts in 12 hours and 20 minutes 
 eulerscheZahl: meh, i'm talking about the fact that it's possible
 eulerscheZahl: real time doesn't matter to me :P
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, did you try to send struct a message on the forum? To give him an email?
 eulerscheZahl: discord private message
 Illedan: ah
 eulerscheZahl: he kept responding to them until he disappeared
 Illedan:&#160;:/
 Illedan: Hope he is ok
 eulerscheZahl: ++
 Hjax: ah he just linked midnight, apparently katmandu is GMT+5:45
 Hjax: oh he hasnt even been online on discord? thats concerning 
 AntiSquid: tbali suggested F(r)og of War as a contest, that's sickening
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even know his real name to investigate
 eulerscheZahl: aka stalk him
 Illedan: hmm
 Astrobytes: Tobou Struct
 Astrobytes: Cousin of Little Bobby Tables no doubt
 AntiSquid: he could be amongst us
 eulerscheZahl: with a new account
 Astrobytes: Anyone ask MK? He games with him sometimes
 AntiSquid: anyone here wants to reveal their secret obsession with hexagons?
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait for someone to recommend the intel performance profiler
 Astrobytes: haha
 Hjax: i just realized both of my forum posts start with "I came in 7th" 
 Hjax: apparently im just teccles - 5
 Illedan: :D 
 Marchete: I recommend the intel performance profiler
 eulerscheZahl: welcome back
 Astrobytes: lol
 Marchete: that's a struct thing or smth?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Marchete: i'll google it
 eulerscheZahl: intel designed that profiler just for struct
 eulerscheZahl: no one else is using it
 AntiSquid: you mean it's unpopular?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know
 reCurse: It's definitely niche
 Marchete: This doesn't sound bad <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/advisor.html">https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/advisor.html</a>
 reCurse: It's very good but it's also very hardcore
 reCurse: Also very corporate
 Marchete: but it's free!
 reCurse: Yeah but it's bulky and still require a (free) licence that you request
 Marchete: ah, I see
 reCurse: A bit like Visual Studio
 reCurse: Free but corporate-y
 Hjax: you pay with your soul
 Marchete: :necktie:
 Marchete: you are talking about C++ in general...
 reCurse: Uh?
 reCurse: That would be Java
 eulerscheZahl: or C#
 reCurse: Java is the most corporate-y language, change my view
 Marchete: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: i never saw C++ as a corporate product
 Marchete: "you pay with your soul" &lt;---
 Marchete: I was saying about that
 reCurse: ...I would say Java also
 Marchete: not the corporate thing
 reCurse: Most soul-expensive language
 eulerscheZahl: the Java Evil Edition

 eulerscheZahl: astro knows that article already
 Marchete: I pass from Java to C# and back easily
 Astrobytes: yup
 Marchete: C++ consumed me in the process
 Marchete: #define true false
 Marchete: and I'm saying the truth
 eulerscheZahl: array of generic list...
 reCurse: Wrong
 eulerscheZahl: java, I hate you
 reCurse: Oh you hit the same snag I did
 Hjax: that article was amazing 
 reCurse: I wonder if anything that comes out of dailywtf ever actually happened
 Astrobytes: Who cares, the Brillant Paula Bean was astounding
 reCurse: Sure
 AntiSquid: the prune array did happen
 AntiSquid: article was removed
 Marchete: to be true, the decompiling and recompiling stuff saved me a bunch of times in Java. I added some patch in a class this way, without even recompiling all the stuff
 reCurse: How did you end up in a situation where the code was lost?
 Marchete: I was working with Java 1.6 stuff, so many stuff was obsolete with bugs fixed on later library versions
 Marchete: it wasn't lost
 Marchete: just the new versions (with bugfixes) aren't available as 1.6
 reCurse: Ah a middleware, ok
 eulerscheZahl: for .net dnSpy is awesome
 eulerscheZahl: you can decompile the program and even debug it and modify functions within the binary
 reCurse: Much more difficult to patch though

 reCurse: I can't
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even kidding
 eulerscheZahl: short range wifi, the cable works like an antenna
 Astrobytes: But cables, plugging in, wifi...
 reCurse: Well I guess airpod straps did happen
 Astrobytes: true
 Astrobytes: Is it a one-way cable? Like a flexible antenna?
 JBM: Damned i missed both the cubing discussion and the brilliant Paula bean reminiscence
 JBM: Way to miss out
 AllYourPellets: anyone know the highest ranked MCTS approach is on breakthrough?
 AllYourPellets: and/or does minimax with hand coded heuristics usually outperform it?
 LoukasPap: .
 SupaStav: .
 Gloryness: .
 LoukasPap: .
 MadKnight: really depends, AllYourPellets 
 LoukasPap: Ελληνας εισαι supa?
 MadKnight: AllYourPawns
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 prepare banhammer
 Automaton2000: what happens when you don't need to pay for that
 MadKnight: or right it's september, means more banhamming
 Hjax: what does september have to do with banning?
 MadKnight: sometimes teachers ask students to solve puzzles on CG
 Hjax: ah
 LoukasPap: nice teachers
 MadKnight: and students being &lt;15yo start to spamming weird stuff
 LoukasPap: hahahahaha
 Hjax: makes sense 
 LoukasPap: Does anyone of you try competitive programming?
 MadKnight: start to spam*
 MadKnight: yea LoukasPap i did
 Hjax: isnt that what codingame is? 
 MadKnight: no it's also puzzles
 MadKnight: and Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why is that a good thing?
 LoukasPap: Well, yes you are rigth in a way @Hjax
 LoukasPap: Yes but it helps on training skills
 LoukasPap: @MadKnight, how did you become competitive programmer?
 MadKnight: i just joined CSB
 LoukasPap: what is cbs?
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back</a>
 Hjax: ive competed here and in battlecode, plus on a few obsolete sites 
 LoukasPap: omg, is it like making robots to fight on computer?
 MadKnight: yea
 Hjax: something like that 
 LoukasPap: So, it is not just solving a problem in real time
 MadKnight: exactly
 Hjax: usually you are writing something that plays a game against other peoples submissions
 LoukasPap: I mean, the programmer has to think how to improve his robot, so it can overcome the others
 MadKnight: yea
 LoukasPap: And each robot can be made differewntly
 MadKnight: urs
 MadKnight: yea
 LoukasPap: So, lets say, someone who has more conditions to check, he  has covered more scenarios, so he is propably gonna win.. Thas awesome
 LoukasPap: Apart from that, I was talking also for online contests (google jam, hacker rank and others)
 MadKnight: who needs those when u got PvP bot contests&#160;?
 LoukasPap: Well, yes, these are very cool to tell the truth. But can you earn any money out of these PvP's?
 Hjax: some of the contests have prizes 
 Hjax: unleash the geek gave out amazon gift cards i believe? 
 Hjax: yeah first place got a 3000€ Amazon voucher
 MadKnight: why would u need money when u got CSB&#160;?
 BOGDAN: hi
 Hjax: hi
 LoukasPap: You mean, because it the CBS is cool?
 Hjax: mad knight certainly thinks so 
 LoukasPap: Hahahahaha i dont disagree, but it would be even better if it could earn you some money
 Hjax: the fall challenge, which starts in 60 days, will likely have prizes
 LoukasPap: Well, I am not skilled enough to compete. In some years maybe
 Hjax: you have 60 days to prepare :D 
 LoukasPap: Hahahahaha, i dont think i have chance. I mean, I am on my 4th year on university, and all i know for now, is java and python, but the basics
 LoukasPap: I still have road ahead to learn, and train my flexibility
 LoukasPap: But, I will keep trying here. This site is very good. Especially when clashing with friends, is so fun
 BOGDAN: lmao I suck at COC
 MadKnight: then don't play CoC, play <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back</a>
 BOGDAN: im trying to get better at it but no sign of improve 
 MadKnight: at what? at CoC&#160;?
 BOGDAN: Yeah
 MadKnight: u won't get better at it in no time
 MadKnight: better do the game i sent
 BOGDAN: alright i did it
 BOGDAN: and for some reason the video thingy is just a static image
 MadKnight: just reload
 AntiSquid: hi MadKnight
 MadKnight: hihi AntiSquid
 Phantomghoul: yo
 Phantomghoul: im new to programming in general
 Phantomghoul: I just started like a week ago I know the basics and whatnot 
 Phantomghoul: you think im gonna struggle a lot on this website?
 AntiSquid: if you close page and never come back there is no struggle, but everyone struggles lol
 Phantomghoul: well lemme rephrase
 Phantomghoul: will I have a hard time...
 Phantomghoul: and I genuinely like this website n also tryin to learn
 AntiSquid: hard time in achieving what? 
 AntiSquid: depends on your goal
 Phantomghoul: hard time in this website
 Phantomghoul: coding here in genral
 Phantomghoul: forge tit bruh

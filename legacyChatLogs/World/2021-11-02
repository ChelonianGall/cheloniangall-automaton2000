 Jerrasterix: Wontonimo, you forgot to look left again :joy:
 Zardosh: ugh i just had the most anger inducing clash of code ever
 lemuria.py: LOL
 jpceia: hello
 VJsong02: which one Zardosh?
 VJsong02: or well
 VJsong02: what was the problem about
 Zardosh: first lemme explain why it was anger inducing
 Westicles: beetles in the anthill?
 Zardosh: its cuz if i had 10 more seconds i would have finished it
 VJsong02: was it shortest
 Zardosh: fastest
 VJsong02: oof
 Zardosh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/204655449045673bfca949754eb6eac40f522a4">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/204655449045673bfca949754eb6eac40f522a4</a>
 VJsong02: oh god those results are fucked
 Zardosh: yea the problem had a lot of edge cases
 Zardosh: i was almost at 100%
 Zardosh: had to treat only one more case
 Zardosh: and i knew how to do it
 VJsong02: what was the problem about?
 Zardosh: theres a random number between 1 and 100
 Zardosh: two players (tom and jerry) take turns guessing
 Zardosh: if the player guesses more than the actual number, i print 'Lower' and lower the boundary of possible numbers
 Zardosh: same thing with 'Higher'
 Zardosh: and if the player guesses the correct number, i print 'Correct'
 Zardosh: but heres the catch
 Zardosh: tom wanted to cheat
 Zardosh: and he bribed me
 VJsong02: relatable irl
 VJsong02: i mean what
 Zardosh: so whenever Jerry guessed the number, the number would actually increase by 1
 Zardosh: and if it couldnt increase by 1, it would decrease by 1
 VJsong02: that sounds cancer ngl
 Zardosh: and if it couldnt be increased nor decreased, jerry would win
 Zardosh: the last case i was about to finish was this last one
 Zardosh: if i had 20 more seconds i would have finished it
 Zardosh: i was so angry when it ended, cuz i didnt even have my 60% or so solution as my last submitted one
 Zardosh: i had tested it with some prints after that
 VJsong02: i think i know how you feel
 VJsong02: it's like when i'm doing shortest and i spend 14 minutes golfing
 VJsong02: and no one's submitted anything
 VJsong02: and i think about how i would've gotten a free win if i just coded the problem normally
 Zardosh: true
 Jerrasterix: 3 bots in one clash... I have never them these many clash bots at once 
 Jerrasterix: how to get to top 1000s in CoC
 Jerrasterix: I can't finish that achievement
 Jerrasterix: :disappointed:
 Zardosh: jeez i just got a pathfinding problem in coc
 Jerrasterix: me too 
 Ftyghi: hi
 Jerrasterix: hi 
 Ftyghi: follow me please
 Ftyghi: @Everyone follow me please
 Ftyghi: its your choice
 Ftyghi: I follow whoever follow me
 Jerrasterix: Don't worry, someone will follow you soon 
 Jerrasterix: and followers are here to compete with eachother
 Zardosh: cmon bro who gave them the idea to put a pathfinding problem in CoC
 Zardosh: if only we had a bit more time it would be doable
 Jerrasterix: wait I will search and see who moderated them
 Zardosh: i mean, if u are experienced with graph traversal and stuff then maybe u can pull it off
 Zardosh: but for me as a beginner id need at least 5 more mins to do it
 VJsong02: we just had a dynamic programming one
 VJsong02: i got a solid 33%
 VJsong02:&#160;:^)
 Jerrasterix: did you finisih it Zardosh
 Zardosh: i was close to finishing it
 Jerrasterix: found it ttps://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1036b48eb16100c9476aa74ae92db8ee4434
 Zardosh: but i didnt
 Jerrasterix: he used Java :scream:
 Jerrasterix: to solve 
 Zardosh: i'll try to continue solving it later to see how long it would have taken me
 DarkLord__28: heya
 Jerrasterix: hey 
 DarkLord__28: wassup
 Jerrasterix: my internet connection is up as always 
 Jerrasterix: so nothing much 
 Thorcode: HI Zardosh
 lemuria.py: i'm struggling with the challenges...
 lemuria.py: bruh
 Jerrasterix: what challenge&#160;??
 Thorcode: After a while trying solution in onboard I know that almost all langague is likely to each other
 Thorcode: so if I learn python sharp I could learn other easily
 TheAvengingTurtle: No.
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: why
 Ftyghi: hi
 Overbed: how
 Thorcode: alot of around level 3  guy here
 TheAvengingTurtle: First because all languages aren't procedural ones. Try to learn a functional language, you gonna have good time.
 Overbed: how to learn python cz i cant participate in these clash of codes
 lakaoe: ur mom
 VJsong02: do kattis
 VJsong02: solve hundreds of problems
 VJsong02: when you know python as good as english
 VJsong02: you can farm clashes
 VinhDaDen: I want to solo code with everybody
 VJsong02: or well
 Thorcode: join codewars
 VJsong02: whatever your native language is
 TheAvengingTurtle: Second, because python is pretty high level. Try to learn C or C++ after python, you gonna sweat when pointers will come.
 Thorcode: high level?
 VJsong02: python is high level af
 VJsong02: it's basically english
 Thorcode: really
 VJsong02: you know what high/low level means right
 Thorcode: well I'm looking for ruby and php
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: but what af mean
 VJsong02: as fuck
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 VJsong02: af = as fuck
 TheAvengingTurtle: Already said to you to not DM like this Thorcode.Not with this acount though, but same for every account. We're speaking on #world, stay on #world.
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: you like husoki
 TheAvengingTurtle: Low level is close of machine language, high level close to human one.
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: TheAvengingTurtle when you said that 
 TheAvengingTurtle: With another account.
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: husoki
 dievasen7: HI
 vaeng: Python is quick to write and has a lot of qol elements that makes it easy to use in these clashes. but it's pretty satisfying to beat them python guys with c++
 TheAvengingTurtle: husoki?
 Thorcode: right you taonly  husoki told me that
 Thorcode: only husoki told me that
 VJsong02: it's also satisfying to see the cancer c++ puzzle solution you've spent hours on finally work
 Thorcode: ok
 TheAvengingTurtle: Well I'm sure I told you that and I'm not husoki...
 Thorcode: how
 Thorcode: who else told me that&#160;?????
 TheAvengingTurtle: I'm honestly sure a lot of people told you that... -_-
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: to my memory only Husoki told me that
 TheAvengingTurtle: But you ignore them :smirk;
 TheAvengingTurtle: Bad memory so :D
 VJsong02: i mean it's common knowledge
 Thorcode: and I checked all message
 VJsong02: so i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people say that
 Thorcode: so who are you TheAvengingTurtle
 TheAvengingTurtle: That's a secret. :zipper_mouth:
 Thorcode: probably Husoki
 TheAvengingTurtle: If you want...
 Thorcode: so who are you TheAvengingTurtle I will check in message on codingame
 VJsong02: what's up with this guy...
 Thorcode: I need to check my stupid brain
 Thorcode: cuz I remember almost everyone caht rule I chat with them
 Thorcode: when
 Jerrasterix: probably your raizobro 
 Jerrasterix: or some dud like that
 AntiSquid: that 2 hour contest is still up&#160;?
 Jerrasterix: yup only closes down on Nov. 4 1600 UTC
 rizonbro: hi guys
 Bandymas: hi
 NguyenAnhQuandev: HELLO
 TheAvengingTurtle: Don't scream please...
 NguyenAnhQuandev: WHY
 darkhorse64: Because it hurts our ears
 TheAvengingTurtle: Exactly.
 TheAvengingTurtle: Oya darkhorse64 btw o/
 darkhorse64: \o/

 Ajdahor: Hello guys. I have a question about how I can write a value in the console. Well, now i play in Clash of code game and i must write conde and turn to play testcase, but I can't write a value in the console and i see only error. but in the code, I have the readline command. I write in c#. what problem and how this working?
 Jerrasterix: can you share the code please 
 Ragin76er: Console.WriteLine();
 Ragin76er: Or Console.Write(); if you don't want a line break on every write to the console
 Jerrasterix: you need to have the variable name you have to print inside the brackets

 Scarfield: "if drug contains an a" *
 Westicles: :thinking:
 Scarfield: if this is necessary to solve it, it probably wont fit in easy though 
 Westicles: right
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Drug is good. Gimme some.
 Scarfield: btw how did you manage to get banned, thought mods were on strike
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Do you really think a mod will ban me? My bro Astrobytes or my teammate euler? Tss :unamused:

 Kroketych: when does the contest end?
 JayTeeBat: Hey guys, naive question here about Mad Pod Racing:What would be the best way to measure the pod's speed?
 JayTeeBat: Ok, that was kindof a dumb question, I'll use the time module to begin with
 JayTeeBat: an even worse question, because why not:How can you display other data than the standard (x, y, thrust) values for code development?
 JayTeeBat: e.g. speed, list of checkpoints, distance to enemy, lap count, ...
 GamingGnawer: I mostly used the error streams for debug data,  if there is way to draw that on screen i don't know it
 JayTeeBat: Would be cool to find out, otherwise, there are limited options to develop algorithm for path finding and path matching other than very naive onces.
 GamingGnawer: starting in gold league the game feeds you more data
 JayTeeBat: oh?
 JayTeeBat: that's good to knoe
 JayTeeBat: shame that I am still a long way from gold... (still in Bronze)
 GamingGnawer: lots of fun ahead of you ^^
 JayTeeBat: ahah, for sure
 GamingGnawer: It is ofcourse possible to make very advanced systems in earlier leagues since you can model the enviroment yourself using your memory of earlier turns.
 GamingGnawer: but that is not necessary to beat the silver bosses... and in gold you're just handed the map as initialzation input
 JayTeeBat: oh really?
 JayTeeBat: I already started doing exactly that...
 JayTeeBat: guess it's a matter of finding the right trade off between the ultimate optimisation and a faster to implement, good enough algorithm
 GamingGnawer: find max(fun)
 JayTeeBat: lol
 GamingGnawer: but worth noting that much of that infrastructure will be obsolote when you level up
 JayTeeBat: awesome :expressionless:
 JayTeeBat: that's fair enough
 Wontonimo: hey people, it sounds like you are talking about one of the bot battles
 JayTeeBat: are the vehicle motion dynamics not changing over the levels? (acceleration, turning rate, max speed, drag,...)
 Wontonimo: the dynamics stay the same
 Wontonimo: for all levels
 JayTeeBat: ah cool, thx
 Wontonimo: what level are you at now?
 JayTeeBat: ahem
 GamingGnawer: but what they are you're not told until later  ;)
 JayTeeBat: bronze league
 JayTeeBat: lvl4
 Wontonimo: congrats making it to bronze&#160;!
 JayTeeBat: ahah, cheers for the encouragement
 Wontonimo: oh, GamingGnawer is in gold.  how did you get there&#160;?
 GamingGnawer: I built and internal model of velocity and global orientation of the pod to beat silver
 Wontonimo: cool
 JayTeeBat: oh?so there is no point in me asking whether there is a way to retrieve the vehicle dynamics model  or if we have to reverse engineer it?
 Wontonimo: you can just read the writeup to the left
 Wontonimo: it is all there
 Wontonimo: you can turn at most 18 degrees,
 JayTeeBat: yeah, it is pretty short&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: you velocity is your old velocity * 0.85 + thrust (all as vectors)
 JayTeeBat: ah, that is useful!
 Wontonimo: that's most of it really
 Wontonimo: you can ignore collision until legend
 GamingGnawer: I think that paragraph is extented as you lvl up 
 Wontonimo: I see you are aiming straight at the next checkpoint JayTeeBat
 JayTeeBat: was planning to do so (ignoring collisions) :grimacing:
 Wontonimo: do you do that when you drive :P
 JayTeeBat: yep, all the time
 Wontonimo: or would you drift
 JayTeeBat: or not
 Wontonimo: i forget if you have all the checkpoints in bronze
 GamingGnawer: If i recall the map pool expands atleast once...
 Wontonimo: has anyone told you that there is a debug option in the playback so you can see where each pod is aiming
 wq2e: this site does not teach you anything :rage:
 JayTeeBat: Seems you know the inside out in here Wontonimo!
 JayTeeBat: tell me about that debug option to see where all pods are aiming 
 Wontonimo: that is right wq2e, this is a "recruitment" site (and so tests you).  it isn't an educational site
 Wontonimo: in the playback, there is a gear icon.  click that and there is an option Debug you can toggle
 wq2e: i am learning javasript or python
 Wontonimo: this site will give you puzzles and multi bot battles to practice, but it doesn't teach
 JayTeeBat: oh, yeah ok, got that in the playback window 
 Wontonimo: if you hang around long enough and work on some bot battles, then some of the admins enjoy discussing algorithms wq2e, but usually only at a high level
 GamingGnawer: I find the site is very good for providing compelling (and animated) problems.
 Wontonimo: JayTeeBat, you can also go to the global leader board and checkout the next league and study better bots <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=silver">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=silver</a>
 Wontonimo: you can click "view last battles" on anyone in the leaderboard and your debug mode will still be enabled, letting you see where their bot is actually facing
 JayTeeBat: cool, I am having a look now, thx!
 Wontonimo: you can also start private chats with people here by clicking on their name.  For example, I sent JayTeeBat a private chat message
 JayTeeBat: yep, got it
 JayTeeBat: btw Wontonimo, what kind of algos are you expecting people to be developing in the higher leagues?pure maths/physics based or also ML ones?
 GamingGnawer: Checking out other leagues was a fun tip I didn't know... as I suspected the top of legendary has stopped racign and started fighting XD
 Wontonimo: yeah, my algo uses something like a Genetic Algorithm.  A dumb inbred cousin of it
 JayTeeBat: ok cool, though I am a long way from it still
 GamingGnawer: what would the alternative to in-breeding be in genetic algorithms...
 JayTeeBat: the legend league battles are amazing
 JayTeeBat: the deterministic races are long behind
 Wontonimo: the alternative to what i do GamingGnawer is actual GA.
 Wontonimo: a GA has a population.  Mine does not.  It is 1 single action path, 1 mutation, if it is better then replace.  then loop
 Wontonimo: hey GamingGnawer and JayTeeBat, reversing the exact game calculation from this site can be a pain so I'll share a trick I learnt that makes it a bit easier
 JayTeeBat: oh, yes please!
 Wontonimo: Write a function that tries to predict the next time frame given an action.  Save the prediction and previous state.  On the next time frame compare the prediction and if it doesn't match write all the appropriate info to debug.
 Wontonimo: Then take the input and output you just captured and turn it into a unit test of your prediction function.
 Wontonimo: it won't take more than 2 to 5 simulations to get very very good test coverage and cover all the corner cases you want.
 Wontonimo: Be very liberal with ignoring things you can't control, like the other player and collisions with them.
 JayTeeBat: makes a lot of sense
 Wontonimo: yeah, it seems obvious now but I struggled the first several months doing it dumb ways
 JayTeeBat: when you say "write to debug", can you detail what you would output?my console is not happy when I output anything but the sys.stderr...
 Wontonimo: what programming lang do you use?
 JayTeeBat: pthon
 JayTeeBat: *python
 Wontonimo: useprint("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Wontonimo: you have to make sure you import sys like so
 Wontonimo: does that work for you?
 JayTeeBat: well, I believe I need to read the doc for the sys.stderr
 JayTeeBat: never used that before
 JayTeeBat: still a python beginner
 Wontonimo: no need.  just use it like that
 Wontonimo: print("All my bases are lost", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Wontonimo: will print "All my bases are lost"
 Wontonimo: to stderr
 Wontonimo: and flush it right away
 Wontonimo: (ie not buffer it)
 Wontonimo: no need to understand it atm
 JayTeeBat:  ah ok, you mean just only display the message when prediction and measurements diverge right?
 Wontonimo: right
 JayTeeBat: ok, got it
 Wontonimo: remember, you can change who you play against, so you can play against yourself and make them both do something very predictable
 Wontonimo: like only thrust forward without turning
 JayTeeBat: and yet smth new I didn't know! :upside_down:
 Wontonimo: you can also choose your previous submit to the arena
 JayTeeBat: that's all great tips!
 Wontonimo: so... you could submit a bot that literally does nothing other than get out of the way.  Now pick that as your opponent and you can play in an empty board.
 Wontonimo: anyway, have fun with it
 JayTeeBat: thx a lot! :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: well, i've got to log off and actually get work done that was due hours ago.
 Wontonimo: for all those learning python , you may find this site helpful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>

 makerecho: how do I fight the boss in pod racing?  It shows I am #1 in wood league, but I never get any fights against boss in arena Oo
 MACKEYTH: It will happen automatically. Sometimes there is a little delay between beating the boss and getting promoted.
 makerecho: ah, ty
 AlPHA_83: Thanks Wontonimo

 MSmits: it's in permanent zugzwang
 MSmits: the only feature you could evaluate is whomevers turn it is basically
 MSmits: even the score is useless, because the score has no bearing on what the best move is
 MSmits: you can supposedly count chains and get a likelyhood that you will end up ahead, but it's basically a halfassed nimstring analysis

 struct: MSmits do you think NN would work on STC?
 AntiSquid: why would it not struct&#160;?
 struct: I think it should
 AntiSquid: i am assuming #1 on stc is NN
 AntiSquid: #clash EmbeddedIs77
 MSmits: it might be a bit complicated. the interaction between player and opponent is weird in stc
 MSmits: same as with hypersonic. If you use a NN there, you lose the powerful beam search that ignores opponent
 MSmits: using a NN in boardgames is just different
 MSmits: might be that it's useful to use a NN partially, in a bot. Do some parts with pure math or brute force and do other parts with NN
 Kyuujin: hello to night coders
 Nick_Svaki: the problem description is hard to understand.
 ZarthaxX: which one Nick_Svaki?
 Nick_Svaki: I don't know how to seek the problem that I can't solve.
 ZarthaxX: what problem is it

 Naitwa-Alexandre: Hello World
 Naitwa-Alexandre: =P
 Imsure1200q: there should be a coc catergory
 Imsure1200q: for optimize
 DaNinja: for speed, memory use, executable size, or LOC?
 darkhorse64: loc=golf
 DaNinja: yep
 Astrobytes: given who's asking, I'd say numbers of rays cast vs number of neurons vs how many successful testcases in Space Maze...
 Astrobytes: Solved it yet Imsure1200q?
 darkhorse64: #rollouts
 jacek:&#160;:?
 Astrobytes: rollout golf? I'm good at that. I can minimise rollouts really easily
 jacek: what about trollouts
 DaNinja: Space Maze was tough, had to hardcode one validator to ignore a couple of platforms because it timed out
 Astrobytes: jacek :rofl:
 Astrobytes: DaNinja: Good job on solving it though. I've still to get around to it.Our friend Imsure1200q here once spent 2 weeks here in chat talking about his raycasting NN space maze solver :P
 Astrobytes: Much to eulers amusement
 DaNinja: impressive :D
 darkhorse64: #BringBackEuler
 jacek: i advanced 1 league in tryangle catch
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: there are only 2 ppl here now
 Imsure1200q: so just because i've spent May 2020 talking about a raycasting NN that means there will absolutely not be an optimizing category?
 Imsure1200q: guess im the center of the solar system now
 DaNinja: need euler back to finish Space Jam <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6</a>
 Astrobytes: Ah he stopped because he couldn't solve it either :D
 Imsure1200q: or perhaps i do not deserve to know how to optimize code just because of those two weeks of at least trying to take on the challenge to solve it?
 Astrobytes: Learn how to optimise your code outside of CoC
 DaNinja: I solved his test cases, now I want more&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: obviously there are the other puzzles but i did see one CoC with optimization in it so why not have a category like that
 Astrobytes: There's an optimisation category.
 Astrobytes: It's about optimising your score though.
 Imsure1200q: as in how much time it takes for the program to run
 Imsure1200q: *complete its task
 Astrobytes: Well there are time limits too.
 darkhorse64: Try board games for that
 Astrobytes: Try bot programming
 Astrobytes: 50-150ms execution time limit per turn
 Astrobytes: 50ms for most
 jacek: or 200ms for :soccer:
 Astrobytes: And that.
 jacek: 50ms for chess, 150ms for othello
 jacek: :tada:
 Imsure1200q: ill probably try othello i suck at chess
 lets_think: let's think
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/othello-1">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/othello-1</a>
 Imsure1200q: got defeated just because i didnt know 1 ture
 Imsure1200q: rule*
 jacek: i probably couldnt play othello on real board, i wouldnt be sure of legal moves and flipping
 Imsure1200q: what
 Astrobytes: It takes practice jacek
 KelvinAndHubbles: isn't othellos catch phrase "5 minutes to learn, lifetime to master" or is that like Triominos or something wack?
 Astrobytes: I think that's Othello yeah
 Astrobytes: It applies to many games generally speaking
 jacek: nyoro~n
 bigmazi: I've just had a clash where the system didn't accept correct answers despite there were always exact match with every single sample
 struct: DaNinja you solved testcases and validators?
 bigmazi: it kept saying "Found nothing - expected 1" despite 1 is the first line printed everywhere
 jacek: additional/missed new lines?
 bigmazi: can I post a screenshot?

 DaNinja: in Space Maze, yes

 Imsure1200q: othelo is 
 Imsure1200q: scary
 jacek: hm?
 hooshemadhoosh: thanks for news Imsure1200q
 Uljahn: we had some sprint contests though
 Uljahn: but they are rare
 struct: Servers cant handle it tbh
 Imsure1200q: what
 Imsure1200q: if othello is 8x8 why is there board size s
 Imsure1200q: but ok i guess
 jacek: so you know its 8x8
 jacek: i think during contribution there was idea if to make it 10x10
 Imsure1200q: but it has to be an even number right or not necessarily?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: well nothing is 'necessary' but how would you place the 2x2 starting square on odd sized board
 struct: Uljahn you might want to ping thibaud :p
 hooshemadhoosh: :yin_yang:
 darkhorse64: #ru is on fire&#160;?
 struct: dont think so, is just that he lost mod tag due to bug
 jacek: huh
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Uljahn too  ?
 MadKnight: me too
 MadKnight: was
 Nick_Svaki: I am not robot.
 darkhorse64: How can we know&#160;?
 DaNinja: click [  ] here
 BlaiseEbuth: Prove it
 Nick_Svaki: so how can I prove?

 MadKnight: ping Automaton2000 to prove
 Nick_Svaki: no click
 Automaton2000: you can start with a simple ga
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 doesn't respond to bots
 Automaton2000: i think that i know of
 BlaiseEbuth: I have not discord. What does he say&#160;?
 MadKnight: i don't have*
 Uljahn: BlaiseEbuth: "following the chat reboot after a certificate update, it seems all the changes in mod rights and banned list from the previous months have been erased"
 MadKnight: u can use discordapp.com in your browser
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. Nothing new. Thx Uljahn
 MadKnight: oh i think i heard that their banned list is only stored in RAM and not anywhere on disk
 MadKnight: so a server restart resets it
 jacek: do they do backup on ramdisks too? AutomatonNN what's your opinion on it
 AutomatonNN: why do you think what does this mean?
 BlaiseEbuth: AutomatonNN is there a way to call euler&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code on the next contest of the contest?
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 DaNinja: :D
 Astrobytes: To summon him these days you must shine the 'e' signal up into the sky

 ShortBaited:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: I have not said anything.
 Cdude: ok
 BlaiseEbuth: MeSeet&#160;: that totally depend of what you want to do. There's no good answer, your question is too generic.
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN summoned me
 AutomatonNN: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 Astrobytes: It was either that or the 'e' signal in the sky
 BlaiseEbuth: A toad&#160;! Shiny day tomorow&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Nice to see you either way&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder contest is over, now i'm bored
 eulerscheZahl: and I missed you
 Astrobytes: We miss you too!

 Astrobytes: hahaha
 IgnacioGb: hi
 Ordonnateur: Is the easy puzzle Chuck norris is bugged&#160;? the third test don't work for me but when comparing manually the binary value and the expected unary it don't respect the rules (or we need to use something else than Integer.toBinaryString(int) to convert the char&#160;? it work for the test 1 and 2 so it seems weird)
 Cdude: hi
 Astrobytes: btw, TC is POTW euler
 eulerscheZahl: illedan shared a screenshot with me
 BlaiseEbuth: *ez
 MadKnight: there's a character that is 6 bits long Ordonnateur your converter probably only did 6 bits instead of 7
 eulerscheZahl: didn't get much boost from it
 MadKnight: u have to do all 7 bits Ordonnateur
 Astrobytes: That must be the Disappointment part of it euler :P
 eulerscheZahl: nah, was dead on arrival. too complex for a multiplayer game that you try for a weekend
 Astrobytes: It does need some time investment, that's true
 struct: euler, DaNinja solved space maze 2
 struct: and hi
 eulerscheZahl: oh, nice
 eulerscheZahl: he has my absolution to publish under his account
 eulerscheZahl: also: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/u972VVE">https://imgur.com/a/u972VVE</a>i got liked from a bot?!
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Astrobytes: Hm, it's achieved sentience
 struct: all bots seem to like you
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still stuck on space maze 2 and probably won't try it againand won't publish anything that I can't solve myself&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: i did othello on a website and i won ._. and you know what that means
 Astrobytes: Raycasting.
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: "i did othello on a website and i won"
 Astrobytes: Manual override? 
 Astrobytes: Would be intriguing.
 eulerscheZahl: just pause the game and then take over
 Imsure1200q: well i mean against a bot but yeah that could be one way of doing it
 Imsure1200q: provided that you can make a turn in 150 ms
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i try to play those moves in my head to understand why my bot makes a decision
 eulerscheZahl: would be entirely on the user-side. no time-limit there
 Astrobytes: Hm, depends on the game. And your solver. Can't always figure it out.
 Imsure1200q: this game is very neural network able 
 eulerscheZahl: but there is no way to play vs arena bots
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not talking about othello specifically
 Imsure1200q: it says that im expected to use monte carlo s tree
 Imsure1200q: wait
 Imsure1200q: tree search 
 Astrobytes: Well, I guess you could play manually offline using replays.
 struct: you can play manually vs js bot
 Astrobytes: So you can almost play against an arena bot
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit, shopping waits for no man. 
 eulerscheZahl: ok, bye
 jacek: :O
 jacek: we missed you
 jacek: (with every bullet)
 Imsure1200q: there has to be at least like some way to win the game every time
 Imsure1200q: like tictactoe
 Imsure1200q: well at least not lose
 jacek: yeah. just be better
 aCat: ok, my newest puzzle ready to upvote and approve&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: i just saw it
 jacek: is this :cheese:
 eulerscheZahl: first impression: giving a full sequence while there is an opponent moving in a way we don't know?
 aCat: cooperative
 aCat: Its just bfs
 kovi: i really like the idea to interact with ongoing game
 aCat: there will be adversarial version soon
 kovi: welcome back euler btw
 eulerscheZahl: :wave:
 aCat: its for basic AI course ^^'
 eulerscheZahl: so we control both black and white?
 ZarthaxX: toooooooooooooooad
 aCat: first bfs - then minmax ;p
 ZarthaxX: you are alive
 aCat: yes euler
 eulerscheZahl: polar beea..ox
 jacek: but minimax is already there
 ZarthaxX: lol :rofl:
 jacek: rebBless made it
 aCat: bfs also ;p
 ZarthaxX: took me some time to get that
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder ended, have to wait 12 days till next contest&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: was it cool?
 jacek: rare contests... what site is that?
 eulerscheZahl: should have tried that website earlier. i always failed to find the running contests there
 eulerscheZahl: such a mess from a web-design point of view
 ZarthaxX: it has an app too 
 ZarthaxX: but it's also messy
 aCat: I was doing topcoders in high school ;p
 aCat: with not much success :P
 aCat: but this was fun and exciting
 eulerscheZahl: i want that tshirt :P
 eulerscheZahl: and their system is complicated
 eulerscheZahl: you get points for high ranks. and those add up to a 3-month leaderboard
 Imsure1200q: playin othello with an actual player hes been thinking for like eternity 
 Imsure1200q: imma do this thing later
 Imsure1200q: for a MCTS that has 4 branches, simulation cap is 10 how much time do you think that will take
 Imsure1200q: well i mean its just 4 branches but uh maybe change that to 10 or something
 struct: so 10 or 4?
 Imsure1200q: 10
 struct: also it depends on the sim speed
 struct: i should be 10^10
 struct: if you stop at depth 10
 Imsure1200q: if sim speed is 1ms whats that
 struct: 1ms to reach depth 10?
 Imsure1200q: yeah for the simulation
 struct: 1000000000 ms
 Imsure1200q: thats hard
 Imsure1200q: idk how in the world all of you manage to get &lt; 150 ms
 struct: well with mcts you dont search all paths
 struct: you do but you dont explore it fully
 Imsure1200q: is your sim depth small like 5 or very big
 Imsure1200q: like all the way to the end of the game or something
 struct: on vanilla mcts you only stop once the game ends
 ZarthaxX: struct why that 1000.. ms thing?
 Imsure1200q: so some people use vanilla and they still get 150 ms
 Imsure1200q: meaning the speed is entirely based on how good or bad your simulation is
 Imsure1200q: *simulation function
 struct: ZarthaxX he was asking how much time it would take to reach depth 10 with all explored if each step would have 10 options
 struct: and each depth 10 sim would take 1ms
 jrke: optimization is main thing in simulation
 Imsure1200q: haha  i have no idea how to optimize the othello thing because every step in the simulation it has to get the valid spots means a lot of scanning
 Imsure1200q: find the valid spots*
 jrke: which lang are you using?
 Imsure1200q: nevermind i found a way to optimize it but it still took me 1 hour and will probably be a very minimal optimization
 Imsure1200q: jrke: js
 Imsure1200q: javascript
 jrke: but why simulation in othello?
 jrke: try minimax
 Imsure1200q: yeah should probably try that a s well lol
 ZarthaxX: struct okey, but it's true tho
 ZarthaxX: not true*
 ZarthaxX: it isnt that linear
 struct: why not?
 jrke: pruning  helps a lol in minimax
 ZarthaxX: you start going through branches each time larger
 ZarthaxX: iterating takes more
 ZarthaxX: so it's even worse than that
 struct: 10^10
 ZarthaxX: that's the amount of times you will rollout
 ZarthaxX: i meant the other stages of mcts
 struct: yeah
 ZarthaxX: the other stages get each time worse
 ZarthaxX: worser every time :P
 Imsure1200q: im gonna watch some tutorial for minimax or smth
 Imsure1200q: idk about minimax in othello cuz in the beginning less is more
 Imsure1200q: but in the end more is actually more
 darkhorse64: If you really want to searching, do not js, python, ... It's just a waste of time and effort
 darkhorse64: do not use
 darkhorse64: It's like trying to perform in a race car with a bicycle
 Imsure1200q: how bout c++
 ZarthaxX: thats the way
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Rust, C++ excellent choices
 Imsure1200q: welp time to meet my nightmares again
 darkhorse64: C also but C++ has more powerful features
 Passifi: yo c++ ain't so bad once you get to know it a little better
 Imsure1200q: i mean i have been using c++ for a long time now especially to help me sort my files
 Imsure1200q: but i kinda forgot it lol
 Imsure1200q: idk ill see if i can recall stuff
 Passifi: interesting I've read that 
 Passifi: you tend to forget c++ very fast
 Passifi: given how much effort one usually puts into learning it that seems pretty unintuitive ^^
 Imsure1200q: just the stress levels in life man :ok_hand: :pensive:
 Imsure1200q: idk c++ was pretty easy for me or at least the way i used it was easy idk'
 Imsure1200q: or maybe its just bias because i've also been working c++ and vulkan stuff and comparatively vulkan is a lot harder
 Imsure1200q: idk ill try c++ with the othelo proble
 Imsure1200q: whats not easy about c++ tho is optimization definitely and now it's time to watch The Cherno videos till 3AM
 Imsure1200q: whatever
 darkhorse64: For CG, you don't need to do fancy stuff, inheritance is nearly always useless, some bits of STL, no templates
 Imsure1200q: yeah templates dont deserve a place in my life
 Imsure1200q: so thats good advice
 Imsure1200q: or info or advice
 darkhorse64: do not forget the pragmas
 Imsure1200q: whats that is that basically the () =&gt; {} in javascript
 Imsure1200q: or is it macro
 Imsure1200q: oh nvm i remember now
 IgnacioGb: Hi guys, is there any forum about using CG efficiently? I just tested CG local and I don't find it fascinating. Anybody knows if I can  use breakpoints. Note aside, I just discovered the "expert" mode in settings, which allows to test your code with custom tests. And that is going to make my CG life so much easier. Any other tips?
 darkhorse64: No, by default, your code is compiled without optimization. Adding a few #pragma usually gives a 3x-5x speed boost. It also gives you access to bit manipulation function and simd for firther speed boost
 darkhorse64: No debug apart from print
 Imsure1200q: is that like compiling options but in the code
 darkhorse64: Search for "pragma" in the forum
 darkhorse64: Yes
 darkhorse64: Important, this must be the first lines in your code
 UnnamedCodinGamer: darkhorse64, which #pragma goes with __builtin_ctzl?
 ZarthaxX: you dont need a pragma for that
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it did not want to compile otherwise
 ZarthaxX: o ctz
 ZarthaxX: the other one
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: thought about fsl
 ZarthaxX: anyway
 struct: UnnamedCodinGamer doesnt compile locally or on CG?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: locally
 struct: compiler?
 ZarthaxX: weird
 struct: msvc doesnt have __builtin_ctzl
 ZarthaxX: oh no LOL
 ZarthaxX: forget about visual studio
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and on CG
 ZarthaxX: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: forget about ms
 ZarthaxX: you can try compiling manually with g++
 ZarthaxX: or use for example dev c++
 UnnamedCodinGamer: It does not compile on CG also
 struct: #include &lt;iostream&gt;int main() {
 struct: this compiles
 darkhorse64: #pragma GCC optimize("O3,inline,omit-frame-pointer,unroll-loops","unsafe-math-optimizations","no-trapping-math")
 darkhorse64: The full monty
 ZarthaxX: lol
 UnnamedCodinGamer: darkhorse64, thanks will test it
 ZarthaxX: wont work in visual studio UnnamedCodinGamer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do not use it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I use kate
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: hope it doesnt do the same as vs then
 struct: does it compile the code I pasted?
 ZarthaxX: ah it's a text editor, whatever
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, it is a text editor
 UnnamedCodinGamer: struct, I am looking into it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it compiles 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it seems i can not copy the error message from the IDE
 struct: yeah its kinda broken on cg I think
 struct: unless they fixed it
 struct: i mean errors are broken
 ZarthaxX: copy the error from the html :P
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is not __builtin_ctzl it is _pdep_u64  
 ZarthaxX: makes sense
 UnnamedCodinGamer: sorry, my bad
 ZarthaxX: you need certain flags to compile that one, which is what pragma does
 UnnamedCodinGamer: so i found #pragma GCC target ("bmi2,tune=skylake") , which works
 darkhorse64: bmi2 handles pdep/pext
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks

 UnnamedCodinGamer: nice tool
 Binary_Sky: nice, found it easily
 Imsure1200q: why cant i see anything at codingame // home
 Imsure1200q: like its just blank
 Imsure1200q: well i mean the sidebars and navigation are still there but not the main content
 Passifi: hmm a quick search through the language options has shown that CG doesn't support QuickBasic. A shame really :thinking:
 Imsure1200q: why
 ccplus: I registered for <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a> . How can I start a relevant problem? Or will the problem arrive later? 
 eulerscheZahl: hi ccplus, are you the one from topcoder?
 ccplus: Yeah, hi =)
 eulerscheZahl: last contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the one before: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can still play them, just without prizes
 eulerscheZahl: expect something like that in May as well
 ccplus: Thanks! So Major Community EventMay 6, 2021 05:00PMjust ment that the registration starts then? But the actual event happens "at some point"?
 eulerscheZahl: that's the start of the contest. it lasts 11 days
 ccplus: But what is it about? How can I compete?

 eulerscheZahl: does it say "You are registered!"?
 ccplus: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: then come back in may or use the time to play previous contests and practice. when the contest starts, it will be hard to miss
 eulerscheZahl: you'll also receive an email reminder
 ccplus: Oh, damn. It starts in May. I thought it started this month :laughing:
 ccplus: Thanks =)
 eulerscheZahl: CG only has 2 contests per year anymore&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: used to be much more frequent
 struct: lets hope it doesnt get delayed&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: be prepared for the worst outcome
 ZarthaxX: well, scenario
 ZarthaxX: structo how is uni :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: a delay sounds unlikely to me, what makes you even think about that?
 eulerscheZahl: the way I know CG, they'd rather host a contest with a halfway finished game than changing the date :imp:
 ZarthaxX: he has a catastrofic vision
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 struct: its good
 struct: not the first time they change
 ZarthaxX: and fix it in those 10 days
 eulerscheZahl: true, i remember a contest where i was glad that i didn't take off early
 eulerscheZahl: so i could still adjust my plans to take the delay into account
 aCat: yeah, on my side we're again incorporate CG contest into classes :P
 eulerscheZahl: class Boardclass Cellclass Player
 ZarthaxX: lol
 aCat: class Student 
 aCat: rather
 aCat: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely that I will create such a class in my bot
 ccplus: Guess I'll probably try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/de291e9a-995b-4661-948d-952ee5433a4e?tab=details">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/de291e9a-995b-4661-948d-952ee5433a4e?tab=details</a>
 AntiSquid: communitybot was some guy who spammed alts, instant ban when i saw the Hii
 Westicles: poor rockstar
 samg11: hello
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl&#160;!
 MSmits: working on bender 4 atm. It's fun
 kovi: oh, forgot to comment on that one
 kovi: i remember you wrote design some days ago
 kovi: it is good, but maybe there is a flow
 kovi: flaw
 MSmits: whats that
 MSmits: still have to code it mostly
 kovi: your position matters
 kovi: if the tree handles that as well
 kovi: than it is ok
 MSmits: sure, but isnt your position the spot where you last switched a toggle
 MSmits: if you dont consider the boulders i mean
 MSmits: (consider them as walls)
 kovi: boulder i think
 MSmits: I mean, i only consider map changes as states
 MSmits: and if boulders are walls, the only way to change the map is using a switch
 MSmits: you can always floodfill from the last switch to find your next possible map changes
 kovi: i had simpler approach but afaicr player relative position caused troubles
 MSmits: yeah, my approach shouldn't have this problem
 MSmits: the hard part is expanding to include moving boulders
 MSmits: because there are many ways to do this and the positions will be variable
 MSmits: will require some pruning (removing useless  boulder locations)
 kovi: yes. only a few options are needed
 MSmits: recognizing the options on an arbitrary map is pretty hard
 MSmits: and of course when all that is done there are the functions
 MSmits: it seems pretty easy to find repeating patterns in solutions and turn them into functions, but functions calling functions will be complicated
 kovi: i cant remember that part well
 MSmits: also functions calling themselves means an infinite loop (the description mentions this). So you can only use that at the end 
 MSmits: I am guessing there's also ways to use functions even when they are bad fits. Say when you're in a long corridor going upward and the function includes moving left, which does nothing
 kovi: i remember. there is the option to add useless blocked movements which may make better repeats
 MSmits: yeah
 kovi: ...
 MSmits: so in your solution, you should also track blocked movements
 kovi: i was not trying too hard, roi is low because of possible hardcoders
 MSmits: this way a longer solution in squares moved could be a shorter solution in characters
 MSmits: roi?
 kovi: return on investment
 MSmits: ahh  and you refuse to do that?
 MSmits: top 10 is probably doable without hardcoding
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: oh lol, didnt see you were 11
 MSmits: I have no problems with the hardcoding part, but i doubt i will spend enough time for those last few ranks
 MSmits: maybe i will just solve it and move on
 kovi: anyway, im clobbering
 MSmits: fun&#160;:)
 kovi: but it seems hard to get heuristics
 MSmits: yeah, i just have a completely random rollout and mcts
 kovi: hmm...how many playouts?
 kovi: top is really doing much better
 MSmits: hmm not sure, i think somewhere in the region of 100k/200k sims
 kovi: :o
 MSmits: i do a full rollout
 kovi: 2nd turn?
 MSmits: so all children for 1 expansion
 MSmits: it gave me 1600-2000 rollouts, but thats * 100 something sims
 MSmits: yeah 2nd turn
 kovi: you do 100 sim per children?
 MSmits: no it's just 1 sim per child
 MSmits: but the early game has 100+ children
 MSmits: per parent
 MSmits: i dont know if this is good or bad, i wrote this bot in half a day
 kovi: hmm. i do 40-50kbut playout - select - expand both takes approx equal time
 MSmits: Actually it's half a day for the bot and half a day for the meta mcts
 MSmits: i did some testing to see if it could be hardcoded
 MSmits: pretty sure it can't, not meaningfully, unless bots get much much better
 kovi: not sure why it is slower that yours (or yurko-s)
 MSmits: well if you do 1 sim, its gonna have less sims
 MSmits: because you have more selection overhead
 MSmits: could easily be a factor of 2
 kovi: i also do full playout
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: well i already shared my sim with  others
 MSmits: did you get that?
 kovi: nope
 MSmits: allright sec
 kovi: started yesterday
 darkhorse64: MSmits: we have approximately the same code; 120k 2nd turn
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89f75378-b16e-46b1-9d90-6b7f4f80455d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89f75378-b16e-46b1-9d90-6b7f4f80455d</a>
 MSmits: sounds right darkhorse64
 kovi: i c. tracking possible move all along
 darkhorse64: I have a bit further than that with SIMD but it was actually slower
 MSmits: what do you mean tracking kovi?
 darkhorse64: I have gone
 MSmits: I just get it from the bitboard
 MSmits: darkhorse64 yeah thats why i didnt even try
 kovi: ah sorryjust treating options separately
 MSmits: i didnt think it would be worth it and you trying it was enough for me
 MSmits: kovi yeah, you need to popcount the moves anyway, 
 pardouin: Hi, only 15h remaining on my contrib to be accepted, I'm a bit worried. If you have time to take a look at it, it would be much appreciated &lt;3
 kovi: i have same logic, but first picking item, merging bitsthen made random direction choice
 MSmits:  ah, i have no idea what it would do to pick the direction randomly
 MSmits: biases some moves
 MSmits: but that may actually be better, who knows
 kovi: i tried both collection and random
 MSmits: you didnt notice anything in my sim that makes my bot faster than yours kovi?
 kovi: but the whole thing is probably slower than yours
 MSmits: mine is mostly the conditions. It has 1-3 conditions depending on where the random falls
 kovi: well, not 2-3xand as I mentioned playout it takes &lt;30% of my time
 MSmits: ah then your expansion must be slow
 MSmits: wait huh, you do 100 sims
 MSmits: and then thats &lt; 30%&#160;??
 MSmits: crazy..
 MSmits: in uttt, i do 1 sim per expansion and its 50% +
 kovi: 50k simand time is 33% expand, 33% select, 33% playout
 MSmits: ohh, you tested this throughout the game i bet?
 kovi: no. it is start
 MSmits: seems really weird
 MSmits: even selection should be much lower
 MSmits: you dont get very deep at all
 kovi: yeah, for other games it was 50% playout
 MSmits: so not much selection happening
 kovi: (after proper bitmagic)
 MSmits: my meta mcts after 100k visits, went like 4 deep max
 Wontonimo: pardouin you can always resubmit if it expires.  It's super easy, in your contribution there will be a big button "resubmit".  you don't have to type anything back in.
 kovi: oh yeah...and i run out of nodes in this one&#160;:)
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b90bfb49-f7d5-4a79-b383-0e612fa5197c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b90bfb49-f7d5-4a79-b383-0e612fa5197c</a>
 kovi: but it has nothing to do with slowness
 MSmits: my node
 MSmits: its almost always like that. I have the state on the node in most simple boardgames, uttt excepted
 MSmits: not sure if i run out 
 Westicles: pardouin, turn it into a WIP and back before it expires so you don't lose your approval
 kovi: this is the first game i run out (on cg)
 MSmits: you would run out in bandas  I think?
 pardouin: ok thanks for the advice
 pardouin: but it's so damn long to get accepted unless it's an easy puzzle, it's discouraging
 pardouin: the fact that thre's a constant amount of 100+ contribs doesn't help
 kovi: bandas: was probably close, but didnt notice bumping into itanyway, time to sleep. thx for tips
 MSmits: gn np
 MSmits: i just noticed that in early game i usually lose my whole tree
 MSmits: in clobber i mean
 MSmits: because 100 children make another 100 children = 10k+ children. But the search is not uniform so some children of children never get expanded
 MSmits: which means there is no tree to retain
 MSmits: reuse
 MSmits: well not always, but mostly.  I dont run out of nodes though, not even close
 darkhorse64: Same. I wonder sometimes if a pure random would not be enough for the 10 first moves. Most of the times, my eval is close to 50% until the solver catches on and finds the win/loss
 MSmits: yeah might be
 MSmits: do you think kovi runs out of nodes because he reserves a full set of nodes for each child he creates?
 MSmits: if you do this, for children you're never going to actually expand, you will run out
 AntiSquid: how do you run out of nodes?
 MSmits: node pool not large enoguh
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 AntiSquid: create new ones?
 struct: reserving for every creation is expensive
 MSmits: AntiSquid there's like a 780 mb limit
 struct: On uttt i reserve like 13mill on one turn
 struct: with 25k rollouts
 MSmits: unless you mean dynamically creating nodes *horrified*
 AntiSquid: reuse reduce recycle
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://happylearning.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/reduce-reuse-recycle.jpg">https://happylearning.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/reduce-reuse-recycle.jpg</a>
 MSmits: what i do is at the beginning of my turn i check if i am near the limit and if so, i just dont reuse the tree and start at index 0 again
 darkhorse64: Yep, not enough rollouts to empty the pool
 MSmits: yeah so i think kovi is doing something wrong there
 darkhorse64: MSmits: stop reading my code
 MSmits: heh, we just talked of mcts too much
 MSmits: then you get similar code
 AntiSquid: so instead of keeping part of the tree you chop the entire tree down?  because of a few dead branches&#160;?
 Westicles: If CG made a new puzzle type where you get 10s a turn, would all these same approaches still apply?
 AntiSquid: maybe they'd recycle a lot more than running out of nodes
 darkhorse64: reallocating would cost too much.
 MSmits: AntiSquid think of it like this. If you're really really lucky, reusing the tree may save you 10% calculation time. How much do you lose by going through 780 mb and reducing the pool?
 MSmits: i doubt its even possible
 MSmits: if you're creating a dedicated solver locally and you are memory limited, then this is worth it
 AntiSquid: let the tree grow more rings
 thanveershah: Is GPT-3  going to take over?
 AntiSquid: it's not even accessible to everyone lol
 MSmits: I'm putting my money on GPT-2
 MSmits: what's GPT by the way?
 AntiSquid: do you have access to gpt-3&#160;? thanveershah
 darkhorse64: Resetting the index does not mean you cannot reuse the tree
 Astrobytes: GPT-n access if you donate to Patreon
 AntiSquid: it's like asking if electric cars will be the norm 
 MSmits: darkhorse64 thats true, with uttt i used to keep reusing it even after reset
 MSmits: thats scary though&#160;:)
 MSmits: you * probably* wont overwrite a node you were still using&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *shudder* my oware issues
 MSmits: i dont run out of nodes in uttt anymore
 Astrobytes: (when I was trying to reuse nodes)
 darkhorse64: It's only when you allocate faster than you "freé" that you run into issues
 thanveershah: I'm a contributer to GPT 
 darkhorse64: bandas is the only example I know
 MSmits: darkhorse64 not necessarily, with a very small exploration parameter, your search can go 20 turns deep or something and if you follow that route 20 turns long you will be using a very  old ndoe
 MSmits: node
 MSmits: so then the question is wether you will go through your full pool in 20 turns
 MSmits: btw oware is a game where tree reuse is very important actually. I noticed most gamestates have only 1 or 2 good moves, so the chances of your opponent picking the move most of your tree comes from is very high
 AntiSquid: oh someone already doing a 9 men's morris
 MSmits: yeah it's cool
 AntiSquid: was considering to do that as a quickie few days ago ... nvm, glad i didn't start it :D
 darkhorse64: Yeah, bandas goes deep. That may explain why I have to be cautious with this one
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: AntiSquid: If you need suggestions, I can give you some
 MSmits: sometimes the game is solved for my at ply 10 or something
 MSmits: for me
 MSmits: so, super deep
 AntiSquid: no i don't
 AntiSquid: need motivation and a clear goal :D
 darkhorse64: With endgame tablebases and shorter rollouts
 AntiSquid: well clearer *
 Wontonimo: go AntiSquid go!
 Wontonimo: how's that for motivation?
 AntiSquid: to the bathroom i go
 Wontonimo: bad squid bad!
 AntiSquid: i am not a squid jeez
 darkhorse64: YurkovAS was kind enough to give me back the lead
 MSmits: seems fairly random?
 MSmits: now he's below me again
 MSmits: he was like 2-3 pts above me before
 AntiSquid: anyone seen volcanoes? first impression makes me think wtf is that
 MSmits: it makes me think, whoa i need to stop looking at this or get obsessed before i finish other stuff :P
 darkhorse64: I have at least 60&#160;% against all. Strange leaderboard
 Westicles: You guys should take time out to approve these four great cribbage clashes
 MSmits: what is it your bot does that is better than my bot btw darkhorse64?
 MSmits: is it just a bit faster or&#160;?
 aCat: approve my chess puzzle&#160;;]
 darkhorse64: I tune some parameters
 MSmits: did you ever upload your pic here aCat&#160;?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://isthisacat.com/">https://isthisacat.com/</a>
 MSmits: AND HI&#160;:)
 aCat: nope
 aCat: hello&#160;;-)
 AntiSquid: trained with lobe?
 MSmits: no idea, but i uploaded that cat that looks like a crow pic and it failed
 Westicles: aCat, that darned 66% at parsing context-free grammar stares at me every time I login
 MSmits: like most humans
 aCat: :D:D
 aCat: I'm sorry Westicles
 aCat: I have similar thing with nicola parentheses puzzle
 aCat: just copypaste my solution, lol ^^'
 MSmits: Westicles would never do such a thing
 JonPinneyBrown: is there a way to look at a previous clash of code you have done?
 MSmits: aside from playing another 400 till you get it again? Nope
 JonPinneyBrown: okay, thank you
 snoyes: You just want to see your code? You can click the notification bell that tells you what place you took. Click that notification to go back
 Westicles: Nah, though I am not against adapting a non-CG solution to solve
 Westicles: For example I already had a sokoban solver from years back that wasn't my own
 thanveershah: I need helo with a question
 tutubalin: what is code size limitation in classic puzzles and optimization puzzles?
 jacek: 100k characters
 daviskz: I check all the questions in a puzzle, take it for granted, but when I send the answer, it shows as if I had one of them wrong, what should l do?
 therealbeef: your solution may not be generic enough
 therealbeef: or if you use c++, the input sometimes doesnt fit in an int but needs a long, and sometimes the tests dont cover that case. but this is not very likely
 daviskz: this is weird because all the solution is correct before l send it, can l report this&#160;?
 daviskz: its a practice puzzle
 therealbeef: which puzzle is it?
 daviskz: Shadows of the knight ep 1
 daviskz: with python
 therealbeef: with that one you can check the replays of the validators I think
 daviskz: yes but they say i'm wrong after i send
 therealbeef: you mean when you submit?
 daviskz: yes
 daviskz: that's the code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/aemuYcNF">https://pastebin.com/aemuYcNF</a>
 daviskz: with python3
 therealbeef: yes, the tests that are run after you submit are usually called validators (and are called tests before you submit). those validators also have replays so you can analyse the failures
 therealbeef: you can see them when you click 'details' next to the score circle
 daviskz: ok ,thank u
 DannyHatcher: is it just me or as a beginner the learn sections are really hard even the easy ones?
 Cyotyc: some are a bit challenging
 Tuo: in c++ how do i get the call stack in CG when throwing an error?
 Tuo: some other way of crashing the bot would work too but often i dont get any output just "did not output in time"
 Nachosauce: Man I'm strugglebussing hard in coders strike back gold league.. I cannot for the life of me properly calculate the angle to the next checkpoint. They gave it to me in the previous leagues haha. 
 Nachosauce: Thankfully the rest of my bot is good enough to carry me almost to legend league but I think if I got that angle calculation down I'd make legend for sure. 
 Tuo: arccos(((checkpoint - current_pos).units_vec()).dot_product(current_velosity)) i think
 Tuo: ah also need to take unit vector for current_velosity
 Imsure1200q: isnt arccos the same for like example 315 deg and 45 deg
 Imsure1200q: like ive had problems with that before in my games i think

 Miki09: In csb gold league is the second pod needed to complete the race? I mean if i want to make one runner which will just run on checkpoints and one blocker which will never pass a checkpoint can i do it?
 DaNinja: sure
 Miki09: But how the timeout works with 2 pods?
 DaNinja: the timer resets if one pod reaches next checkpoint
 Miki09: Oh 
 Miki09: so only one pod is needed toreset the timeout?
 DaNinja: right
 Miki09: Thanks
 Maxim251: I have question, I am strugling about creating function is_moving(), where is the best way to put that function? Return type will be bool, because I want to know if unit is in move<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/E1dPL7D">https://tech.io/snippet/E1dPL7D</a>
 struct: I would just put it in I_UNIT
 struct: but i dont really follow oop good practices in cg
 Maxim251: UNIT class I use to store data, but in future I want move them to heroes, because for example TOWER is static unit and is not movable at all, Thats why, I am wondering what to do. 
 Maxim251: I am still learning this type construction of OOP, and I dont want make bad habbit, and stick to it.
 Shurishe: If not all of derived classes actually can move the it is bad to put move speed in base class. Typically base class contains features that are common for all derived
 jacek: or make I_MOVABLE_UNIT derived from I_UNIT and put there
 struct: robo first on bt o.o
 Maxim251: hmm.. Then I could put all simmilar functions about position in that class.
 Maxim251: like speed, is moving, is close..
 jacek: oO
 Joe1014: i fix the x y i need do what?

 None121232: Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 None121232: help me
 JustCoderAs: firstly create an array that keeps the value neg or pos of the temperatures
 JustCoderAs: and compare the values with abs
 JustCoderAs: if its index in keep array is negative  
 JustCoderAs: create an value and declare it as -1
 JustCoderAs: if its posive decalere as 1
 JustCoderAs: after all 
 JustCoderAs: print neg_or_pos_value*temp(abs)
 JustCoderAs: @none121232
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: why do we even need an array
 MiyamuraIzumi: just compare each input
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: dont forget the abs. you need to exercise
 struct: I just used avx
 null22: hello, i'm trying to solve the following exercise&#160;:

 null22: thank u, i read it but it don't help me
 null22: im trying to solve it in C
 FoxLee: what's special about C that blocked you from solving it?
 UCYT5040: this is confusing me
 UCYT5040: what does the autogen code in python do
 UCYT5040: more so, what should i provide it?
 null22: i understood how it is stored in memory, like in the first array, there is a space, _, space and so on. The in the second array we have | space space | so on and in the last array |_|. I don't know how to proceed to convert the first element to a "0"
 null22: i'm french sorry for my english :nerd:
 UCYT5040: Im gonna try this again later, way to confusing
 FoxLee: my idea of doing it is to concat the several strings into one string. One string for one digit.
 jacek: good idea. but why in C? oO
 null22: thanks for the reply, i want to learn C :grin:
 FoxLee: C is good enough for this simple stuff

 zaraptwillbebeaten: you could use an external editor
 Tarantulae: is there a suggestion place? either give a font change option or use an actual good font?
 Tarantulae: I'd love me a Consolas
 jacek: try forums or discord
 Uljahn: just use browser's Web Console to change the font [solved]
 JohnZhang3: Hi, anyone know after join a clash, how do I review the question and test case, is there any record of it?
 Uljahn: JohnZhang3: you can try to find the clash with eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/

 Maxim251: I did just understand what I did..

 Maxim251: I did use constructor to recive data from game input,
 Maxim251: but now I need delete all units and create them again to recive new input
 Ques: I find it difficult ..
 Maxim251: Problem I have now that I units cant remember nothing, like last position, because on each new game iteration units are deleted and created
 Maxim251: UGH....
 Maxim251: I spend so much time for that game. And I did such simple shool mistake
 Tarantulae: ugh, stupid solve clashes in under 3 minutes
 Tarantulae: how can i close all these old clash chat windows?
 Astrobytes: Maxim251: Create a bunch of units/whatever objects on the heap at the start
 Astrobytes: Update them every turn by ID or whatever
 Maxim251: Yes, now I see that.. But when I was busy with sorting all data structure, and how them sort, I was thinking that this approach is great idea. But when I start duing logic for a game, after that whole hard work, I notice that I did terrible move... And it is a hell pain in the ass to reorganise all that code
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/e8fVfvc">https://tech.io/snippet/e8fVfvc</a>
 Maxim251: This link show, how much work it cost me to just prepare input from a game
 TimothyAlexisVass: I want to do a generic check in a 2d array in JavaScript...
 TimothyAlexisVass: I haven't thought about this before, but maybe someone here has a quick answer, otherwise I'll look it up.
 Maxim251: Problem also wit the units is that they are constantly changing, that means I need track all existing units by the id, and create new one if new ID is not existing, and delete old units if theirs ID did not get displayed
 TimothyAlexisVass: a=[1,2,3]i=a[4]
 Maxim251: Whole data input is mixed also with BUSH, TOWERS, HEROES, and WARIORS
 MSmits: good evening
 TimothyAlexisVass: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a4a20240-231d-40aa-a7c9-6216ce6d310c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a4a20240-231d-40aa-a7c9-6216ce6d310c</a>
 TimothyAlexisVass: How can I do something like this? (This won't work, gives reference error)
 TimothyAlexisVass: a=[1,2,3]i=a[4]||0
 Maxim251: You try display 4 position in array of 3 elements
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yeah I know
 MSmits: Astrobytes finished rewriting my yavalath bot. Seems to solve much faster in lategame, but it doesnt have a good book yet, so it falls in early game. It's comparable to the other non-NN's though, like it was before
 MSmits: so now i have no more excuse to put off the NN stuff
 marguera: go for a ternary thimoty
 TimothyAlexisVass: I want something like this...a=[1,2,3]i=a[4]?a[4]:0
 TimothyAlexisVass: If a[4] exists, i = a[4], otherwise i = 0...
 marguera: what language
 marguera: check for the length of a
 TimothyAlexisVass: What I am actually wanting to do is this:
 TimothyAlexisVass: a = [ [1,0], [1,0] ]
 TimothyAlexisVass: for ( i in a ) {
 TimothyAlexisVass:   b = a[i-1][0] || 0}
 TimothyAlexisVass: so first time in the loop, b = 0 and second time, b = 1 (a[0][0])
 TimothyAlexisVass: "If value exists in array, set to that, otherwise, set to 0"
 marguera: cant u check if i &gt; 0?
 marguera: i &gt; 0&#160;?  a[i-1][0]&#160;: 0?
 TimothyAlexisVass: I want to do this in 8 directions, so it becomes very complicated. Which is why I'm asking if someone knows a way to do a generic check.
 marguera: oh i see
 marguera: which language are you programming
 marguera: maybe some kind of inline catch
 TimothyAlexisVass: JavaScript
 mohitdhule: you can use at() method
 marguera: isnt the second at is going to throw an error if the first at is not found?
 marguera: if u know what ur doing i would try catch this
 mohitdhule: we can do like this
 mohitdhule: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/549d8db5-6b0b-4351-b87c-5df35a801eed">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/549d8db5-6b0b-4351-b87c-5df35a801eed</a>
 TimothyAlexisVass: at works
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you mohitdhule!
 marguera: nice solution, dont know what this&#160;? does
 marguera: Optional chaining
 TimothyAlexisVass: Hmm
 TimothyAlexisVass: The JavaScript used here at CodinGame does not support array.at()&#160;:\

 jacek: mohitdhule rowi and xx are references to the same object. change something in xx and rowi will change. change something in rowi na xx will change
 jacek: oO
 Maxim251: I learn how o use priority_queue because of that game. But menage  all that data input is bit crasy
 mrfacysus: How can I in C# use a for loop inside defining of a variable
 Maxim251: That game for me is like Unicorn, unavaible every time I try to reach it
 jacek: most games with complicated inputs are like that
 omboyo: how can you make a copy of the list and not have them connectet to eachother then? jacek
 jacek: rowi = xx.copy()

 AmazingPro: what is multi jacek?
 nulte: idk
 nulte: ok enough trolling
 AmazingPro: haha
 jacek: nothing particular at the moment
 AmazingPro: u cool guys men
 nulte: ill try to find a game for you and port it
 jacek: make it NN friendly
 AmazingPro: what is NN?
 nulte: neural network
 AmazingPro: its hard
 nulte: Im not sure
 nulte: I havent learned it yet
 jacek: make NN that will do that for you
 nulte: sounds simple
 DEIZ21: hi, i see certification section when i open a codingamer profil, but i have none, how can we get certifications?
 nulte: from the quest map
 nulte: You check the boxes you have completed
 MSmits: jacek yeah I am unsure whether to do a  yavalath NN or oware NN. I can use supervised learning for either one of them
 MSmits: have a bit more data for oware now.

 midoooo: how ca i know the clash who is taking into consideration number of caracters
 Raghuveer: :funny:
 Raghuveer: hi
 Raghuveer: what are you doing
 Raghuveer: can you teach me python
 Raghuveer: please
 Raghuveer: by Raghu
 DiL: hi guys! is it possible to definetly close a DM chat?
 Hanh: hi
 Raghuveer: #Dm
 Raghuveer: his chat
 Raghuveer: thanls
 Raghuveer: why this
 Uljahn: Automaton2000 to the rescue
 DiL: I mean: I would like to close a Direct Message chat opened with another user. we're no longer chatting but it still keeps showing... thanks
 Automaton2000: you are just going to say that
 LelouchVC2: Yea, does that all the time
 Uljahn: DiL: close it and reload the page
 DiL: Uljahn: I tried, didnt solved
 Uljahn: try ctrl+f5
 DiL: thanks Uljahn: fixed it!
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 TranHuy: gooo
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN hi
 AntiSquid: weird question to ask here :p
 AntiSquid: at the top right click save and the save &amp; commit, which runs all cells and saves your work
 AntiSquid: then you need to click on the number and click "go to viewer", then scroll down to output, select the file you want to submit, most likely the one ending in .csv and then click submit&#160;! and then make sure to select the your best score on the submit screen
 AntiSquid: geez CG makes life much easier
 AntiSquid: also you could ask people on kaggle how to do stuff there lol, they're very helpful
 AntiSquid: i joined their discord but nobody talks in there 
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN are you still there?
 Raghuveer: Yes
 Raghuveer: hahaha
 Raghuveer: :fun:
 Raghuveer: :thumpsup:
 Raghuveer: ok
 Raghuveer: :thanks:
 Raghuveer: :ok:
 Raghuveer: :wink:
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, Im back AntiSquid :D asked it here as could not get an answer anywhere there
 caubeloatchoat24: Yuck! Are u only win 3 game&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: AntiSquid, I am not able to find the output in the notebook viewer,  I think it is being deleted after I exit the editor
 WINWINWIN: @caubeloatchoat24 not Evan that many :P
 Raghuveer: can you clash
 caubeloatchoat24: Why this code error bro: "cout &lt;&lt; 1^2;" (in C++). Or i have to use a template?
 caubeloatchoat24: "^" is Bit Xor 
 tanmaycodernovice: for _ in' '*n:print(o)
 tanmaycodernovice: what does this line means?
 WINWINWIN: print(o) n times
 Uljahn: if o is of str type, it could be shortened to:print("\n".join(o*n))
 WINWINWIN: print((o+'\n')*n)
 WINWINWIN: would that work?
 Uljahn: yes
 remi6: exec(n*"print(o);") is shorter
 Imsure1200q: what do you think is good golfing language?
 struct: ruby perl 
 Imsure1200q: k i learn ruby
 rak1507: ruby is a great golf language
 Astrobytes: Java
 Imsure1200q: you cant fool me java is trash
 rak1507: perl is confusing 
 Imsure1200q: yep perl is confusion
 Imsure1200q: i think the tutorial section was rushed lol
 Astrobytes: perl is only confusing if you don't know what you're doing
 struct: puts [?o]*nprint((o+'\n')*n)
 rak1507: which I don't
 struct: ah o is a var
 struct: even shorter than
 struct: dont need the&#160;?
 rak1507: can anyone recommend a good resource for learning golfing?
 WINWINWIN: codegolf stackexchange

 Astrobytes: Finished Space Maze yet?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Imsure1200q: nah c++ was rude to me
 Imsure1200q: and music production wooo
 Imsure1200q: working on 3 musics so
 Imsure1200q: but imma come back to it later and not use the A*
 Imsure1200q: just gonna use practical solutions
 Imsure1200q: how do you do red letters
 Astrobytes: Red letters are a CG Premium feature only
 <b>**Imsure1200q slaps&#160;? around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/45527340374232" /> Imsure1200q: lol fishbot
 WINWINWIN: Yes, it is very expensive to get red letters
 Imsure1200q: orange letters?
 WINWINWIN: Even more so
 Imsure1200q: r a i n b o w l e t t e r s 
 Imsure1200q: how about latex
 rak1507: is there a golfier way to do (x.to_i-0.1).abs in ruby?
 Raghuveer: :what:
 WINWINWIN: temperatures?
 rak1507: ~~maybe~~
 rak1507: how the hell did someone get a 33 in ruby
 rak1507: that's just ridiculous
 Imsure1200q: wdym 33

 Raghuveer:&#160;:/'
 Raghuveer:&#160;:/
 Raghuveer:&#160;:/ it is so bad
 ToreForsell: rickity rallity
 Hjax: good morning
 eulerscheZahl: good afternoon
 Hjax: im trying to rewrite my othello program in rust, not sure how successful im going to be 
 Hjax: it wouldnt surprise me if it ends up slower than the java one 
 Hjax: oh Washier just passed me
 dbdr: Hjax: it should definitely be faster if done right
 dbdr: let me know if you have questions
 Hjax: im not super far along yet 
 Hjax: i wrote movegen and make 
 Hjax: and the move gen seemed slower than the java equivalent, but i think the jvm is just optimizing it away somewhat because i was just calling it in a loop 
 struct: also remember that ide in rust is in debug
 struct: so its way slower 
 Hjax: im writing it in intellj locally 
 struct: ah ok
 dbdr: are you using the release mode?
 Hjax: yep
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 Hjax: most of the language doesnt feel that foreign, the array slicing thing is pretty weird 
 dbdr: that's pretty powerful, no?
 dbdr: or what is weird?
 Hjax: the idea that a slice of an array is a view of the array, rather than a new array 
 Hjax: also it seems i cant for each over an array, just a slice? 
 dbdr: you can do a new array is you want, but if you don't need it, a slice will be faster than what you could do in Java
 Hjax: yeah is neat, its just new to me to have it work that way 
 dbdr: you can do both for x in array and for x in &amp;array
 dbdr: first one consumes the array
 dbdr: most times you'll use for x in &amp;array
 Hjax: when you get a reference to the array you just get a slice of the whole array right? 
 dbdr: yes
 Hjax: hopefully it will be a lot faster than my java version at the end, the entire bot is basically just bitmath 
 Hjax: so id expect a compiled language to be pretty speedy with it 
 dbdr: the JVM can be reasonably good at compiling bit operations
 dbdr: Java is a compiled language&#160;;)
 dbdr: but you definitely got more control in rust
 Hjax: java is in some magic place in the middle between complied and interpreted 
 dbdr: yeah, the machinery is complex
 Washier: hey guys.
 dbdr: but for any code that matters, it will be compiled after startup
 Washier: loving the Othello
 Hjax: i tried pretty hard over the weekend to optimize my java mcts, and i couldnt do better than 10k rollouts on turn 2 
 Hjax: Washier your newest submit is a lot stronger 
 Hjax: well done 
 dbdr: with MCTS you probably need to allocate, right?
 Washier: ty
 struct: how far from the boss Washier?
 Hjax: hes 0.3 behind it 
 Washier: if I can give a tip - it is really really simple once you realise one thing
 dbdr: go go go Washier
 Washier: soo close, the boss just pips me atm
 Hjax: so i tried using a node pool, and it was way worse than not using a node pool 
 Hjax: maybe i did it wrong somehow 
 struct: I guess the boss is a bit above average
 struct: on strength
 Hjax: the boss is a monster 
 struct: but if you compare against top bots it isnt very good
 dbdr: I think fast MCTS implementations in all languages end up preallocting, and using indexes in the large node array
 Washier: its very good. 
 Hjax: boss should have been a 10k rollout mcts, not 40k lol
 Washier: lol
 Hjax: Washier what does your bot do? mcts or minimax?
 Washier: minmax
 Washier: *minimax
 Washier: spent some time building board\movegen logic. all bitbaording. was worth it.
 Hjax: yeah i think my bitboard is pretty solid / fast 
 Hjax: but i think my use of memory is poor, and thats why im slow 
 Washier: then once you find the same aha moement i did, you will be stronger
 Washier: i'm only going 4 deep
 Hjax: well im doing mcts
 Hjax: probably need a different aha moment 
 Washier: still need to understand mcts yet.
 dbdr: are you doing playouts until the end?
 Hjax: me? yes 
 Washier: impressive
 Hjax: i do full random playouts to the end of the game, i get about 10k on turn 2 
 Washier: oh wait, i'm thinking gametree again. leme see how many random games i can play in 150ms
 Washier: haha, I only manage ~300 playouts from turn 1. 10k is wow
 struct: turn 1 or 2?
 struct: ah sorry
 Hjax: the boss does 40k though 
 struct: I was thinking on uttt
 struct: or not
 Washier: turn 1. dont have playout code, just a loop
 struct: wait on first you have 2000ms
 Washier: yes. i use that to fill a cache used by my bit counter. but i measure 0.5ms per random game, so i can playout a measly 300&#160;:)
 struct: What do you define by playout on minimax?
 struct: until you reach max depth?
 struct: Also remember that code in Arena runs on release mode on C#
 struct: So the numbers on IDE are not accurate
 Washier: i did run realease. i dont define playout for minimax, but to max depth = 4 is what i mean yes
 Hjax: wait since when is the first turn 2000 ms?
 Hjax: i thought it was 1000
 struct: I increased it
 Washier: usually is 1000 afaik ye
 struct: But its like this since release
 Washier: do you guys do stuff in that time?
 Hjax: i search for what i thought was the whole time 
 Hjax: but apparently it was only half of the time 
 Hjax: i just tried to add a node pool to java again
 Hjax: 1/5th the speed
 Hjax: i probably should take into account symmetries, but i feel like thats hard to make work with mcts 
 struct: Do you take symmetries into account dbdr?
 struct: I doubt its worth it tbh
 struct: But I havent played the game
 Hjax: it matters a lot in the opening 
 Hjax: i would get a lot more  tree reuse 
 dbdr: struct: no
 Washier: my gut also says symmetries not worth it. dont want to offend people because i'm a very small fish in a big pong but i think a simpler bot is better for othello. 
 Hjax: i still dont really understand how i am messing up node pools 
 Hjax: you create a big array of nodes on startup, and use pool[index++] whenever you need a new node 
 struct: Do you have multiple pools?
 Hjax: no?
 struct: Where are you running into problems?
 Hjax: using a node pool divides my search speed by 5 
 struct: In java right?
 Hjax: yes
 Hjax: havent finished my rust implementation yet 
 Washier: haha.  wish i Could say that.
 wlesavo: RIIR :slight_smile:
 jacek: symmetries help when building opening book
 jacek: in actual game tree search, no
 TodorVachev: why is .sort() not working in javascript? 
 TodorVachev: .sort() to this array [  322,  548, -50,  529, 1009, -78,   -3]returns:[    -3, -50, -78,  1009, 322, 529,  548]
 jacek: are they treated as characters, not numbers/
 TodorVachev: yes they are integers. I have parsed them before sorting
 TodorVachev: const inputs = readline().split(' ').map(num =&gt; parseInt(num));console.error(inputs)console.error(inputs.sort())
 struct: put entire code here
 TodorVachev: thats the code 
 TodorVachev: inputs.sort() is not sorting it
 TodorVachev: 322 548 -50 529 1009 -78 -3 thats the input, says that it is a "list of integers"
 darkhorse64: You must say you are sorting them as integers
 struct: inputs.sort((a,b)=&gt;a-b)
 Astrobytes: ^ this
 darkhorse64: ¨
 Scarfield: dont do javascript, but readline is only for a string i guess (?)
 TodorVachev: oh this stupid javascript why cant anything work the way you would expect it to work
 Astrobytes: sort() without args is alphabetical
 darkhorse64: ^
 Hjax: Astrobytes you missed me whining about how slow my mcts is
 TodorVachev: yeah, it worked thanks
 Astrobytes: Ah there you are Hjax, how is it going?
 Hjax: i cant get over 10k rollouts&#160;:( 
 Astrobytes: Oof
 Hjax: so i started porting to rust 
 Astrobytes: Oh hey, well that should help
 Hjax: but it makes me unhappy to not understand exactly why it is slow 
 Hjax: so im still trying to figure it out 
 Hjax: at some point ill get fed up with mcts and go to minimax i think 
 Astrobytes: Hm. I'd just roll my eyes and mumble Java-JVM-something
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I still think MCTS is promising, and you should get way better results in Rust
 Hjax: ive seen some mention when i was reading online of a hybrid approach 
 wlesavo: Astrobytes  or rather why in this stupid java cant anything work the way you would expect it to work
 Hjax: you do a mcts tree building thing, but replace the rollouts with a low depth search 
 Astrobytes: lol wlesavo
 darkhorse64: Another possible explanation is that your bitboarding code is slow
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, the minimax hybrid thing
 Hjax: i spend less than 5% of my total time in my movegen and make functions 
 Hjax: i have profiled it a lot 
 Hjax: im pretty confident my bitboards are fast 
 darkhorse64: Ok. Wrong explanation then
 darkhorse64: Back to Java sucks .... :grin:
 Astrobytes: lol
 ekym: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 darkhorse64: I am a C++ only guy with enough background to write in languages with C like syntax. Can't really help
 Hjax: i spend some large amount of my time in my rollout function 
 Hjax: which is just getting a random number, masking off the random move, making it, and checking if the state is terminal 
 struct: cant the GC be the problem?
 Hjax: the GC is /always/ a problem 
 struct: I dont know java so Im just throwing stuff
 Hjax: if the rust version is fast ill blame java 
 Hjax: its pretty much a direct port, because its almost entirely bitmath
 Hjax: so it shouldnt take me that long 
 struct: You seemed stornger vs the boss Washier
 Washier: that bot is a bastard. shot me down again
 struct: Did you change anything?
 Washier: im looking ahead 5 moves now. but also limiting(beam seach) it to the first 9 moves. still dumb hint hint - me thinks its all in the eval function
 jacek: you implemented prune array eh
 Washier: Snef is also really tough
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Hjax: Washier is beating coffee cup and losing to me 
 Washier: yes, but very dumb, just expand the first 5 moves(order from top of board!)
 Hjax: so im gaining points 
 Washier: HJax, also reallly really tough bot.
 Washier: Also keep losing to field3
 Washier: my bogey bot
 struct: Just wait until you face dbd r&#160;:)
 Hjax: once i get more playouts ill be more scary 
 Washier: would b an honour if I get there
 Washier: HJax, i think you search way more space than me. 
 Hjax: yeah but im doing monte carlo instead of having an eval function 
 Hjax: which is probably just worse 
 Washier: not sure
 Washier: BeardedWhale also kick my behind often
 Scarfield: "Someone might eventually know something" :p
 Washier: hahaha, very good. but i dont hink so
 Hjax: Scarfield actually knows everything, hes just too humble to say so 
 Washier: saw that. humblest of all
 code_maniac: "So humble that you will not be able to comprehend it"That's what his/her bio says :p
 Hjax: when i said "he", i thought to myself "i have no idea the gender of anyone on this site, but im just going to go with he unless im informed otherwise"
 Washier: lol
 Washier: it doesnt matter.
 code_maniac: well i was also writing he only, but than thought it is better to keep both :p
 Hjax: id imagine the gender ratio on this site is very male favored 
 Washier: i would imagine so too. its unfortunate. my wife is way more clever than me, big time engineer, women can most certainly dooo eet
 code_maniac: i don't think in that perspective, i think this community is pretty active and helpful.
 Hjax: oh for sure, its just a cultural thing, women get scared away from engineering and especially programming 
 Hjax: which is a shame
 code_maniac: No everywhere
 jacek: i see femaly avatar, im assuming female
 jacek: i thought re curse was one
 Washier: i also do that. naturual i suppose
 Hjax: i feel like that assumption will be wrong more often than its right 
 code_maniac: And the first program ever written was written by a lady
 code_maniac: 😁✌️
 Washier: Ada Lovelace
 Hjax: my avatar is female, but i am not, for instance 
 Astrobytes: I really am a cat.
 Imsure1200q: no
 Washier: haha
 Hjax: re curse is 2b from nier automata
 Hjax: pretty popular game 
 struct: What am I?
 Washier: #schooled
 Imsure1200q: a struct
 Imsure1200q: from c
 Washier: haha
 Hjax: oh yeah all of the cat avatars are actually cats 
 code_maniac: hahahha
 Hjax: teccles is currently sleeping in the sun somewhere 
 Hjax: Astrobytes do the paws make it hard to type? 
 Hjax: :P
 Washier: thibk 80% of people on here love cats
 Hjax: i have considered joining the ranks of cat avatars 
 Astrobytes: Not at all! It's easy once you get the hang of it Hjax :P
 Washier: haha
 Hjax: i have a very old cat, he could be my profile picture 
 Washier: mine is turning 13
 Hjax: hes 18 years old 
 Imsure1200q: he like older than you?
 Washier: wow. you win
 Astrobytes: Both of mine have been known to 'type' in this chat once in a while
 Imsure1200q: aka press keyboard
 Hjax: not older than me, im 23 
 Astrobytes: 18! wow, old fella!
 Imsure1200q: does it have babies
 Washier: 18 is very impressive
 Imsure1200q: take a picture of the babies
 Hjax: no babies 
 Imsure1200q: b
 Hjax: just one old, clingy cat 
 Hjax: he went deaf a year or two ago
 Imsure1200q: what if it had babies but they ran away
 Hjax: but hes still happy 
 Washier: shame
 Astrobytes: Aw bless him
 Washier: i have two boxers along with the cat. opposite of relaxing
 Imsure1200q: and if u have a dog then does your cat fight ur dog
 Astrobytes: lol, great dogs, boxers
 Washier: clowns of the dog world
 Washier: cat is boss tho. she takes none
 Astrobytes: My cats are both nuts.
 Washier: best kind of pets
 Astrobytes: One is permanently attached to me, follows me everywhere.
 Hjax: my cat is like that too 
 Hjax: i can walk circles around my house, and he will just follow the whole way 
 Washier: pets are the best stress relievers i find
 Astrobytes: Yup. I know that feeling.
 Washier: this Othello bot is stubborn. will have to sleep over it
 Washier: *boss
 Washier: time for pirate metal&#160;:)
 struct: We need 10 bots on wood 1
 struct: so we get 100 battles per submit&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, not massively into pirate metal but being Scots means I automatically like Alestorm
 Washier: haha Alestorm yass
 Washier: struct - should get better as more people join
 Astrobytes: yeah I'm actually surprised there aren't more players atm
 jacek: maybe they are hooked to yinsh
 Washier: yinsch looks complicated&#160;:)
 Hjax: othello is getting me to finally learn rust
 Hjax: so thats a victory 
 jacek: nah rust isnt succesful in othello
 jacek: only  2 rust bots in wood 1
 Astrobytes: Maybe you can translate some of your other bots too for more practice
 struct: rust bot only has around 99% win rate
 Imsure1200q: into tbilisi
 Astrobytes: What?
 NewfieBullet: Can i message in this in the middle of a clash
 Washier: rust sounds like managed C with some threading bits, me like
 struct: yes NewfieBullet
 Washier: Tiblisi is the capitaol of Georgia
 Hjax: usually im good at the non speed critical multis 
 Hjax: so porting rust doesnt have a real benefit 
 Hjax: which isnt super motivating 
 Hjax: my PR2 is in python, who needs speed anyway 
 Washier: HJax, you into data science\machine learning?
 FreeDoom4ik: \
 Hjax: im interested in it
 Hjax: i dont really do any myself, but i follow the bigger advancements somewhat 
 Washier: still like coding?
 Hjax: it would be cool if this site allowed pytorch or something 
 Hjax: yeah i love coding, i do it professionally and still have motivation to work on personal projects 
 Astrobytes: Used to have Keras (iirc) but for python2, and had a number recognition puzzle. But got deleted.
 Hjax: the barrier of entry to using a NN on this site is pretty high 
 Hjax: since you have to write it yourself from scratch 
 Hjax: i guess you can use numpy 
 jacek: or goold old vectors in c++ ;v
 Hjax: i would try to go full alphazero on othello, but its too much work without libraries 
 Washier: HJax, i'm askin bcause you sound like you wpuld get tired of coding in 5 years. imo. data science and NN's are great to learn
 Hjax: i conceptually understand nns, i have wrote some simple ones 
 Hjax: i took a machine learning course in college 
 Washier: excellent
 NewfieBullet: I'm stuck on a clash smh my head
 Scarfield: :pray:
 Scarfield: not quite Mr. Burns hands
 Washier: hehe
 Hjax: i still have a lot to learn in terms of systems languages 
 Washier: cant go wrong with C. 
 Hjax: im fine in high level languages, but learning rust will keep me occupied for a while 
 Washier: pointers master you must
 Scarfield: The order of the movies decided i did
 Washier: haha
 NewfieBullet: I thought i was good at python til i hopped on this lol
 Hjax: i think im reasonably competent with both java and python 
 Hjax: although trying to write high performance java seems to be going poorly for me 
 Hjax: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ blame the jvm
 NewfieBullet: I did an intro comp sci course in python at university and it blows my mind how much more I can learn from five minutes on this or youtube
 vuslat: süper
 NewfieBullet: Like didn't even know the map function was a thing
 Washier: me thinks when it comes to these managed langs(java,c# etc), you need to stick to the same stuff you would in low level langs.

 jacek: so clashy
 AbundantPuddle: Somebody just surpassed you. Lol.
 NewfieBullet: I like it when you get a full lobby of a fuckjed question noone can answer lolol
 Washier: sorry NewfieBullet
 Hjax: tomatoes doesnt seem to be getting more rollouts than me
 Hjax: i wonder whats different 
 tomatoes: they're not completely random
 Hjax: ah, you biased them 
 Hjax: heavy playouts 
 jacek: so heavy
 Astrobytes: So heavy that you will not be able to comprehend it
 struct: When NNs for Othello?
 Astrobytes: When I finish my AlphaZero implementation 
 Astrobytes: (not really)
 Washier: For the evaluation funvtion
 Astrobytes: I'd wager at least one person will be working on it
 Washier: 1. Search deeper. 2. Evaluate leaf nodes better. 3. Profit
 jacek: is N tuple network a NN?
 struct: What is that?
 Washier: second?
 Washier: tuple might be how you feed it
 jacek: tuple, an extracted pattern from game board
 Imsure1200q: javascript is definitely my main codegolf language

 Washier: i hate js in code gold, its short
 Washier: *golf
 Imsure1200q: lol u hate losing to peepl?
 Washier: yes
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Washier:&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: but i hate ruby people
 Imsure1200q: do you hate them too?
 Imsure1200q: cuz ruby shorter than js
 Washier: Console.WriteLine...and i lose laready. learning ruby as a comeback
 Imsure1200q: whats that language lol
 Imsure1200q: pretty inconvenient
 Washier: but short
 Imsure1200q: no the one with Console.WriteLine
 Imsure1200q: in ruby its puts
 Washier: C#
 Imsure1200q: e w w
 Washier: same as Java
 Imsure1200q: java is system.out.println
 Imsure1200q: yeah, kinda long
 Washier: remember, every language has its place. all languages are good
 Washier: except cobol
 Imsure1200q: how to thumbs up emoji
 Imsure1200q: :thumbs-up:
 struct: jacek that quality though&#160;:(
 jacek: its java
 Washier: sorry();
 Imsure1200q: java is going down the toilet i guess
 struct: I mean picture quality
 struct: its 249x243

 Imsure1200q: and the imports tho

 Washier: C# is the same, VB.Net also. it a trade-off
 Imsure1200q: import Java.util.* //18 chars
 Washier: except when golf
 Imsure1200q: using namespace std; //19 chars
 Imsure1200q: isnt VB.net close to C#
 Hjax: who is golfing in java 
 Hjax: dont do that 
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Imsure1200q: who was that Eric guy
 Washier: i do it in C#, often beat java, c\c++ bots&#160;;)
 Imsure1200q: idk but every code golf and i see a person who completed 20% and has 584 chars
 Imsure1200q: ... and shows his code
 Imsure1200q: ... and its j a v a
 Washier: helps people learn
 struct: `cat`
 Imsure1200q: not if its 20%
 Imsure1200q: especially the void main(String[] args) function
 NewfieBullet: Yeah facts if you figure out the problem please share your code
 Washier: seeing not how to do something is also instructive
 NewfieBullet: Nothing sucks more than not figuring it out and not getting code
 Washier: thats when its only you and bots
 Imsure1200q: do you mean putting 0 code
 Washier: usually
 Imsure1200q: lol so the java guy is a bot?
 Washier: check their profiles. it saysa bot if it is one
 Washier: kinda sad
 Imsure1200q: how about AlkhinJohn he sometimes uses java
 Washier: bot
 Imsure1200q: and the java always last place in codegolf xD
 Imsure1200q: its a law
 Washier: every language has its place
 Imsure1200q: but java is not in codegolf
 Imsure1200q: will codingame have support for jelly and osable?
 Washier: no, neither is C#
 Astrobytes: The reason they have bots is so you can still clash when there aren't enough real players
 Washier: exactly. its pretty cool really. but sad
 Hjax: so i just biased my rollouts, which makes my win probabilities look awful, 
 Imsure1200q: ya everytime, theres like at least 2 bots in a clash
 Hjax: but i think my bot is better
 Washier: kewl
 Imsure1200q: so much bot bot
 Washier: bots is the beesknees
 Astrobytes: Nice one Hjax. Wait, your Rust or Java?
 Hjax: java 
 Imsure1200q: btw what do we do after we solved a contribution puzzle
 Astrobytes: Give it a test run then!
 Hjax: yeah its submitted already 
 Washier: checking
 Imsure1200q: ye all the testcases is good
 Imsure1200q: after submitting the results will it be validated already?
 Imsure1200q: or do we need to review it 5 stars
 Washier: once you submit its done
 Imsure1200q: theres no submit button
 Astrobytes: A pending contribution?
 Imsure1200q: ye
 Astrobytes: Leave constructive comments if applicable, vote down or up as applicable.
 Astrobytes: Try it in multiple languages etc
 Imsure1200q: is there a standard for validating contributions or personal thoughts
 Imsure1200q: I'm pretty sure the contribution can be done in all languages
 Hjax: i think my changes are a massive improvement against snef and the boss, and a huge regression against field3 
 Astrobytes: Yes, but you need to test the generated stub code etc
 Imsure1200q: whats stub code?
 Astrobytes: lol Hjax, too specific?
 Washier: go Hjax, good luck
 Aravindhsiva: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1275007ca8f834a52db5e706a1551e8dcb9e5d6">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1275007ca8f834a52db5e706a1551e8dcb9e5d6</a>
 Hjax: dunno, i just biased my rollouts to pick moves that my opponent could also make first 
 Hjax: and now it beats snef and the boss
 Washier: getting warmer
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q, the default code is generated by the stub code. Check it works in all languages, it sometimes doesn't
 Hjax: i should really set up brutaltester 
 Hjax: for othello
 Washier: brutaltester?
 Hjax: its a program that mass runs test games locally 
 Astrobytes: Definitely a strong submit Hjax, good improvement
 Snef: Hjax nice submit
 Hjax: i need more games against you snef
 Hjax: aw i lost one 
 Hjax: i jinxed it 
 Snef: I maybe saw one bug again with a game vs you
 Washier: i also was pleading for more agains Snefm they will come
 Hjax: low win% when i was winning?
 Washier: *Snef
 Imsure1200q: is lua a code-golf?
 Imsure1200q: lang
 jacek: snek
 Snef: I see my self winning (score=0.78) next turn i see myself loosing (score=-0.9)
 struct: not good enough for golf
 struct: Its on par with javascript +-
 Snef: it shouldn't change that much in one turn
 Hjax: monte carlo sometimes misses singular important moves 
 Imsure1200q: how about perl?
 Hjax: and suddenly realizes how bad its position is 
 Washier: python is the most accessible and golfy at the same time is it not?
 Snef: yea but not that much usually
 Hjax: man this submit is doing super well against the boss
 Washier: noice
 Snef: spam submit to bring him down then :p
 Imsure1200q: i guess ruby tops them all golf-languages?
 struct: I think perl can beat ruby sometimes
 struct: also bash is good
 Washier: i keep losing about 2 out of 7 against boss
 Washier: bash is good to know too
 Imsure1200q: just gonna stick with javascript for now
 Imsure1200q: maybe ruby will welcome me well
 Washier: that safe
 Imsure1200q: perl was too messy so
 Hjax: the matchmaker really doesnt want me to play snef
 Washier: haha know the feeling
 Hjax: im playing scarfield a ton, and no snef
 Washier: me too!
 Hjax: weird 
 Imsure1200q: hjax whats the game name
 Hjax: Othello
 Imsure1200q: thx
 Snef: Hjax there is CGBench tool
 Snef: to test code
 Snef: it's really usefull
 Hjax: i know about it 
 Washier: Scarfield is like my friend now i played him\her so many times
 Hjax: i dont want to test, i want rating points 
 Hjax: :P
 Imsure1200q: Vb.net looks gross imo
 Snef: well submit again :p
 Washier: you are competitive&#160;;)
 Snef: hopefully you'll get boss below me :D
 Hjax: so many games against scarfield and k4ng0u, no snef 
 Hjax: i dont get it 
 Washier: you beat me twice know Hjax
 Washier: wd
 Snef: it's just random
 Hjax: the rng hates me 
 Washier: woooza
 Washier: relax
 Hjax: im just kidding :P
 Washier: dont believe that&#160;:)
 AdamJimenez: POG
 struct: Nice submit jacek
 jacek: nope, i jsut reverted to old one
 jacek: w00t
 struct: oh ok, it lokoed better than previous
 Washier: think the nature of the game introduces a lot of noise. 
 jacek: ooh, i  timeouted
 Astrobytes: HOW D A R E YOU
 Washier: hahahaha
 Washier: my bots usally live on that edge. 1 timeout in 10 games is ok. push push
 Imsure1200q: is monte carlo tree search 
 Imsure1200q: just rapid testing
 Snef: and statistics
 Snef: yes
 Imsure1200q: just randomly guessing and hoping to find the solution?
 Snef: not really
 Astrobytes: No, it's when you climb a tree, and just look around in random places for nice leaves.
 Imsure1200q: but making random guesses educated by previous guesses?
 Astrobytes: That's the statistical part
 Snef: Hjax could you bring down the boss instead of me&#160;?&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: astro im pretty sure monte carlo or smth did not climb up a tree and pick some leaves and then come up with the controversial MCTS
 Astrobytes: lmao
 Washier: you play as many games as you can for each of your next moves. the move with the best outcoe you choose
 Imsure1200q: im pretty sure newton didnt say "an apple fell on me so imma make this life-saving mind-blowing 3 laws"
 Imsure1200q: i mean if he did then ok i guess
 Washier: you need to implement(or git) a game engine to do this. 75% of the fun
 Imsure1200q: so its basically simulation?
 Washier: yes
 Snef: you need simulation to use search algorithms
 Astrobytes: ^this
 Imsure1200q: haha
 Imsure1200q:&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: intel i3
 Washier: you can doo eeet
 AdamJimenez: how do i close chat
 Imsure1200q: the youtube play button on the bottom
 AdamJimenez: found it thanks
 AdamJimenez: i thought it was to run my script
 Astrobytes: That one's a bit more to the left.
 AdamJimenez: no shit
 NewfieBullet: sensei can you share your code
 NewfieBullet: I'm brain farting on this code clash and i'm gonna give up
 Imsure1200q: just looking for a challenge that doesnt use simulation
 Imsure1200q: everytime i use simulation my CPU and Memory go 100% and Codingame be like "ooo ur not responding i fail ur code"
 jacek: gg washier
 Snef: Imsure1200q your code isn't running on your computer
 Washier: ty
 Astrobytes: It's nothing to do with your computer
 Washier: so stoked.
 Imsure1200q: oh good then i just trash at optimization
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes i don't think the error_log is being flushed in othello before the output is processed
 Astrobytes: GG Washier!
 Imsure1200q: but c++ is not letting me optimize&#160;:(
 Washier: ty
 Imsure1200q: giving me an error with pairs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92c4c2c2-e2a9-4fce-8932-3b7065a80eb3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92c4c2c2-e2a9-4fce-8932-3b7065a80eb3</a>
 Imsure1200q: when i do the A* algo
 struct: grats washier
 Washier: ty
 Hjax: did i bump you above the boss?
 Hjax: or did you resubmit
 Snef: you did
 Washier: i didnt do nothin
 Imsure1200q: why is Code of the Rings related to brainf**k
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when i do a die();  the error_log stops in its tracks too
 Hjax: with him gone, i think i can promote now
 Washier: btw, losing my ass of in the new league 
 Washier: i miss the boss and the wood 1 gang
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: If it wasn't happening before it might be in your code?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes sry didn't see struct
 Hjax: trying something new, it looks weaker though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: trying to track down a bad node in my othello tree, think its in my move generator
 jacek: good thing your bot is slow, not much to track :v
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all i get is a bad index on line 0:... , when i try to add to error-log to track it down it executed the die command before the log has finished being written to
 Astrobytes: Can you do a manual flush?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if I let it run without the die command, i get a big warning that keeps me from reading the error_log very well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: something about not reading all input before outputting ...which is BS
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's CG's latest annoying error msg that pops up whenever it wants to
 Astrobytes: Usually when I write to stderr more than 1 line
 PatrickMcGinnisII: As soon as I do a depth 2 search I gete garbage, depth 1 is fine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll figure it out, yea that warning is annoying
 struct: C# made it before Java
 jacek: garbage?
 Washier: wooopw oowwowpp
 Washier: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: "C# made it before Java"The Simpsons did it before
 Washier: haha
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Washier: honour to meet you sir
 Astrobytes: Ah, Toad Worship. Don't lick him.
 Washier: cannoot....resist...
 eulerscheZahl: no need to see it as an honor&#160;;)

 Astrobytes: hahaha oh dear
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damnit, I make a move array outside of the class to save time and save it in the class, but apparently php doesn't opy it fast enough before my program tries to access it...wth is going on, it works in other langs.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The php kernel needs an enema
 Astrobytes: Bitboard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll move it into the class and see if that works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: stupid
 eulerscheZahl: you are free to code in another language
 PatrickMcGinnisII: as soon as i make over 11 nodes, it barfs ... its not my move generator
 Astrobytes: Passing around unsigned longs is faster than passing around arrays
 Astrobytes: in PHP anyway
 Astrobytes: And yeah, c'mon man just use C will ya :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm passing a list of 0 to 63 ints
 Washier: 1st rule of code. Be absolutely sure its not your issue
 Astrobytes: But why, when you can just set n out of 64 bits
 Washier: pass a ulong
 Washier: the whole game engine can be built with ulong's, no lists needed, think masks
 Astrobytes: Would definitely advise against arrays Patrick, sure convert to an array where you need to but just use ul's 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well I found php doesn't like free nodes, so I basically store the node pointers in an array ... so the memory cleanup starts screwing up once I dump a tree about a dozen times
 Astrobytes: :shrug:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll clean it up, just a php thing, ignore me
 Washier: good luck
 PatrickMcGinnisII: barfs intermittently:  $this-&gt;l[$startnode]-&gt;movelist[$i]

 Astrobytes: lol, classic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh, I been writing in C since 1987
 Astrobytes: Why stop now?!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did Pascal before that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and basci and asm before that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and then they taught me fortran in college, and I hated them for it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I should do C#
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i know
 Astrobytes: FORTRAN is useful, not here but it's got it's place
 jacek: in graveyard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I should clarify, Fortran 77
 Astrobytes: Isn't that still the most frequently seen version? Legacy systems and all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i have no idea, the formatting can kiss my ___.  I think the math functions in Lisp were better
 NewfieBullet: Bahahah i'm in a reverse clash with zero fucking clue what the pattern is
 Astrobytes: And the modern compilers optimise whatever the version
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops, GF wants to NETFLIX and chill... (Program&lt;=&gt;Girlfriend) = -1
 eulerscheZahl: then share the given info NewfieBullet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterzs
 eulerscheZahl: &lt;=&gt;is that the new C++ spaceship operator?
 NewfieBullet: Test 1 input: "MAM", output: "J"
 NewfieBullet: Test 2 input: "JFMAMJJASON" output:"D"
 eulerscheZahl: january february march april ...
 NewfieBullet: Test 3: input "OND" output "J"
 jacek: did you write it euler
 Yolo_Swagosaurus: Jesus, some people do not understand the idea of shortest mode
 NewfieBullet: AHAHHAAH The variable name is months
 eulerscheZahl: no. but saw the clash before. i think when it was still pending
 Astrobytes: ...
 NewfieBullet: If i legit read that i couldve had it done five minutes ago lol
 eulerscheZahl: i never created a clash of code
 Astrobytes: You so should
 Astrobytes: Clash of Toad
 eulerscheZahl: nah, i prefer working on bigger things
 LelouchVC2: *wink*
 eulerscheZahl: and then fighting with the graphics :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 Yolo_Swagosaurus: Guys are there any bots on this website?
 Hjax: i like how im taking snefs rating points and donating them to field3
 Astrobytes: So generous of you
 Hjax: call me robin hood 
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: there are thousands of bots, Yolo_Swagosaurus
 Yolo_Swagosaurus: eulerscheZahl Why tho?
 eulerscheZahl: even a few in clash of code.and &gt; 100k at coders strike back
 Hjax: isnt that the point of the site?
 eulerscheZahl: it's part of the website: write your own bot and compete
 Hjax: would be pretty depressing if there were no bots
 Astrobytes: There's a whole section dedicated to 'Bot Programming' so...
 Yolo_Swagosaurus: No i mean in clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: even on chat: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i would like to use a ga
 Yolo_Swagosaurus: oh
 Yolo_Swagosaurus: well frick me then
 Hjax: the clash bots are there to give you an opponent if no one is around

 Hjax: otherwise clash would never have any players 
 Astrobytes: DAMN YOU
 LelouchVC2: who are the clash bots?
 eulerscheZahl: haha
 Astrobytes: :D
 LelouchVC2:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I was literally about to hit enter
 Hjax: ok well i dethroned snef with a heuristic that i dont really understand 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a>everyone above 10k clashes is a bot
 Astrobytes: gj, what's your heuristic?
 LelouchVC2: if there are bots
 Hjax: literally just "play moves that are also available to your opponent first while doing rollouts"
 LelouchVC2: how is tychkorg not a bot
 LelouchVC2: he's on like 24/7
 eulerscheZahl: tychkorg *is* a bot
 LelouchVC2: niiiceeeeee
 Hjax: im still 1.1 points behind the boss
 Hjax: but for some reason that was a huge improvement overall
 jacek: do bots need to do the captcha? :o
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/cf32237762b3e3a59bf053529ac635d29520652">https://www.codingame.com/profile/cf32237762b3e3a59bf053529ac635d29520652</a>literally says so on the profile page
 LelouchVC2: lmao
 LelouchVC2: i never looked at his profile
 darkhorse64: basically, you are restricting move choices for your opponent
 jacek: mobility heuristic eh
 Astrobytes: It's called mobility. You wanna maximise yours and minimise his
 darkhorse64: ^
 Hjax: yeah im familiar with it as a minimax heuristic 
 Hjax: but i didnt think it would work in monte carlo
 Astrobytes: Anyone tried EPT with this yet?
 darkhorse64: I'll let you know when I leave lb bottom
 Astrobytes: That or the hybrid shallow-depth MCTS-minimax idea I think should be good
 Astrobytes: (The one you mentioned earlier Hjax)
 LelouchVC2: My life is a lie
 LelouchVC2: the people i've been fighting against
 LelouchVC2: have been bots
 eulerscheZahl: they are real players from the past
 Astrobytes: lol darkhorse64, at least you fixed the timeout
 LelouchVC2: im so dead
 LelouchVC2: CoC has betrayed me
 eulerscheZahl: time to get into multiplayer games
 Astrobytes: ^
 LelouchVC2: Not all my rivals have been bots
 LelouchVC2: but so many
 LelouchVC2: &lt;/3
 Hjax: join us in othello
 LelouchVC2: Is that bot programming?
 Hjax: yes 
 LelouchVC2: My first and only bot
 eulerscheZahl: or upload your own game: otoado
 LelouchVC2: And the damn game broke at my peek
 Astrobytes: In multiplayer everyone is a bot. But it's bots written by us.
 eulerscheZahl: or github
 Astrobytes: "otoado" :D
 LelouchVC2:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't github your bots.
 Hjax: Astrobytes can you run a game against me, i want to see how badly i lose 
 LelouchVC2: fist fight, it gives better results
 eulerscheZahl: never bring a fist to a gun fight

 Hjax: i put up a fight that game at least 
 Hjax: your eval didnt just increase forever 
 Astrobytes: lol indeed
 Astrobytes: My arena version is not... optimal, may I add (it's pretty shit)
 Hjax: well i know my bot is terrible 
 Hjax: it wins by mistake sometimes :D 
 Astrobytes: And my IDE bot jsut crashes so :D
 Astrobytes: *just
 eulerscheZahl: silence! I kill you!
 eulerscheZahl: sorry i'm late with that joke, was distracted
 Astrobytes: I keeeeeeel you!
 Astrobytes: Ahmed. Such class.
 Hjax: you forgot the phlegm
 Astrobytes: *Achmed
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: yes, there was a issue with the solver not exploring all nodes (which is a good thing par se). When I had several skip nodes in a row that resulted sometimes in selecting nullptr. Now, the solver is working which increases my bot strength. Still last but closer
 Hjax: you are using mcts solver?
 darkhorse64: Yes. But I was not careful enough with pass moves
 Hjax: how much did solver help
 Hjax: i havent tried to implement it yet 
 LelouchVC2: Where's this othello thing
 LelouchVC2: SO i can enhiliate u all
 Snef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/othello-1">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/othello-1</a>
 LelouchVC2: thanks &lt;3
 darkhorse64: I helps in two ways: once, a node is solved, it does not get explored anymore. 
 Astrobytes: Aha, I see. Not an instantly obvious bug indeed.
 darkhorse64: You also don't need to explore all children of a solved node. Yeah, I use skip nodes (a null move that just switch players) to keep on alternating players (allowing lots of code resuse) but it's more tricky that it seems
 darkhorse64: *than*
 Astrobytes: Definitely easier to handle null moves within a/b framework
 darkhorse64: My initial intent was to include the solver in the boss. It would have been even stronger
 Astrobytes: Next boss.
 Snef: i'm glad you didn't
 tomatoes: passes has great bug opportunity
 NewfieBullet: I'm begging everyone to please share their code in clash of code lol
 NewfieBullet: I have gotten stuck and failed without an answer so many times
 LelouchVC2: I usually do &lt;3

 NewfieBullet: Love it
 LelouchVC2: anyone coding this othello bot in C++?
 Snef: you can see it on the leaderboard
 LelouchVC2: could have just said, "Yes, I am"
 Snef: yea but that way you can see for others
 LelouchVC2: just a quick question&#160;:( 
 LelouchVC2: even though it's outputting infront of my eyes, it tells me iv timed out
 LelouchVC2: Any insight?
 struct: replay
 LelouchVC2: replayed a million times
 struct: Paste the replay hjere
 LelouchVC2: With C# equivalent code, it plays the first round
 LelouchVC2: And then times out
 LelouchVC2: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475155416">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475155416</a>
 jacek: and the code
 LelouchVC2: i only wanted to test out the game. I only added two lines
 LelouchVC2: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a9c85e01-0d5d-4c3c-9ede-90e23c72b862">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a9c85e01-0d5d-4c3c-9ede-90e23c72b862</a>
 struct: you need endl
 struct: after you output
 LelouchVC2: wew, that's gay
 jacek: you need to get all inputs
 LelouchVC2: thanks
 struct: also get all inputs yeah
 struct: or you will have problems
 LelouchVC2: okie &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: thanks guys 
 jacek: someone codegolfed it into 126 chars
 LelouchVC2: Crazy idea
 LelouchVC2: Your code creates a new game for every turn, and the new game is exactly where the current game is at
 LelouchVC2: and it plays out the scenario of making each move
 LelouchVC2: 🧠
 LelouchVC2: you run out of CPU power about 20 seconds in
 LelouchVC2: But you can't lose&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Um, yes.
 Astrobytes: minus the CPU part and not losing
 LelouchVC2: Alabama
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: That was everyone's reaction when they got there too
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 Hjax: i feel like LelouchVC2 almost figured out minimax 
 Hjax: but then didnt 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 Hjax: the mobility heuristic is so funny for mcts 
 Hjax: my bot will usually report below 20% win chances 
 Hjax: and then suddenly spike to 100%
 Hjax: when it solves the game 
 LelouchVC2: Like when your climbing a mountain and cant see the top
 LelouchVC2: "WE WONT MAKE IT" 
 LelouchVC2: 10 steps later: "oh, we're here"
 Astrobytes: Or are you? Might be a local maximum.
 Astrobytes: So you figured out minimax and hill-climbing so far, anything else to report?
 jacek: true ai
 Astrobytes: Prune Array™
 LelouchVC2: I figured out that the boss is racist
 LelouchVC2: He think he's an expert just because im black
 LelouchVC2: well, i have an idea for how I want my bot to play
 LelouchVC2: But the thought of coding it makes me lazy
 Hjax: werent you saying youd destroy us a few minutes ago 
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2 08:49PMWhere's this othello thingSO i can enhiliate u all
 jacek: shakespear eh
 Astrobytes: As men in rage strike those that wish them best
 jacek: how can i see the boss points?
 Astrobytes: View a replay
 struct: 33.89
 ortz: :grinning:
 Hjax: im surprised people dont use the debug prints more in games like othello
 Hjax: its fun to see the win% move around 
 Astrobytes: Sometimes a source of shame too :D
 Hjax: my bot can make snef print out WIN, and then win after 
 Astrobytes: snef's win prediction is a bit off I think
 Snef: i don't have solver
 JBM: a Bit
 Hjax: i usually get at least a&#160;:) while im winning 
 Hjax: what win&#160;% is the&#160;:) Snef? 
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Snef: 65% for&#160;:)85% for WIN
 Hjax: ah 
 Snef: 45% for&#160;:(15% for LOSE
 Snef: 35* for&#160;:(
 LelouchVC2: I'll still destroy you all
 LelouchVC2: Just when I get around to it
 Snef: LelouchVC2 use the time you chat to code&#160;:)
 Snef: and destroy us
 darkhorse64: The proof of the bot is in the submitting
 LelouchVC2: Have some errands
 LelouchVC2: I'll start coding it tomorrow if bot coding is still in my veins
 Uljahn: submit or delete
 Uljahn: dive into coding the struct way
 Hjax: rank 1 in one submit or delete
 Astrobytes: Betcha 10 codinpoints he doesn't
 Hjax: lol
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm out for tonight. darkhorse64 fix your bottom, gl Hjax, I expect you in Wood 1 tomorrow!gn all&#160;;)
 tomatoes: wood 1.5
 Hjax: ok ive joined the ranks of the cats 
 YEET1: BOIOII
 YEET1: JZBoy
 YEET1: this is insanely hard
 YEET1: Lts go
 LelouchVC2: rank 0 in one submit cause im so pro
 boinkus: AAAAAAA
 boinkus: I LOST BY ONE CHARACTER
 boinkus: SOMEBODY KILL ME
 LelouchVC2: come over and the deed shall be done
 boinkus: HAH
 boinkus: I BEAT THE PERSON WHO BEAT ME BY ONE CHARACTER
 boinkus: BY ONE SECOND
 boinkus: REDEMPTIONNNNN
 LelouchVC2: 🧠
 boinkus: Thats me
 boinkus: Mr. Big brain
 LelouchVC2: Wtf is thisssss
 LelouchVC2: Literally all I added was a single nested if statement and my program doesn't output in time..
 boinkus: I'm having weird issues too
 LelouchVC2: Everytime I give bot programming a try, it's just trash on here
 boinkus: It's saying the js heap is out of memory
 boinkus: mcScuse me?
 LelouchVC2: The first round should be give 2000ms, which is 2 seconds
 LelouchVC2: MY PROGRAM IS DEFINITELY NOT TAKING TWO SECONDS
 boinkus: Mines not running at all
 LelouchVC2: Yea, idk
 boinkus: welp idk what to do so I'm submitting
 Hjax: if you are timing out, its probably that you arent printing anything at all 
 Hjax: rather than a single if being too slow 
 struct: or not printing \n once again
 Hjax: oh struct youre still awake?
 Hjax: im used to being all of the EU people being gone by now 
 struct: Yeah I just got back home
 struct: I usually stay awake until 3-4 am
 Hjax: oof
 Hjax: man im good at typing
 Hjax: i combined two sentences 
 struct: Where?
 struct: Im confused
 struct: :p
 Hjax: "im used to being all of the EU people being gone by now "
 Hjax: i started typing "im used to being alone"
 Hjax: and then switched midway through 
 struct: I read it just fine
 struct: That also happens to me
 LelouchVC2: It says "did not output in time"
 360hazzy: hey guys
 360hazzy: im a noobie lol and that clash of codes was really difficult
 LelouchVC2: I put a "cout &lt;&lt; "HERE";" in different parts of the code
 LelouchVC2: before that ONE NESTED IF STATEMENT, it outputs HERE
 LelouchVC2: RIGHT AFTER IT, it outputs nothing
 Hjax: cout? that will count as an invalid output from your bot 
 LelouchVC2: There's no outtput at all. And why would cout be invalid output?
 LelouchVC2: I'm coding it in C++
 360hazzy: i really dont understand class of codes lol
 LelouchVC2: Keep doing it and it'll get easier
 360hazzy: am i supposed to make the variables or am i supposed to type what they are saying on the screen
 LelouchVC2: The program you write will be fed input
 360hazzy: im 17 btw lol
 LelouchVC2: All you have to do is take the input and make the program be able to output what the tests expect
 LelouchVC2: hi 17, I'm Lelouch
 360hazzy: bruh i mean my age lmao
 360hazzy: second person who did me that lmao
 360hazzy: funny
 LelouchVC2: :D
 360hazzy: bruh
 360hazzy: still failure
 360hazzy: im doing php
 360hazzy: can u help?
 LelouchVC2: Just when you give bot coding another chance, it fucking destroys ur will to do it
 LelouchVC2: I don't know php
 360hazzy: burh
 360hazzy: java?
 360hazzy: hmm
 LelouchVC2: C++ is where it's at though
 360hazzy: well it says Test 1 right and under it says 1234567890 and the out put is (123) 456-7890
 360hazzy: what i am doing is creatigng the variable
 360hazzy: creating*
 360hazzy: $Test1 = 1234567890;if($Test1 = 1234567890){
 360hazzy: not working
 LelouchVC2: So you'll see a premade program which takes in input. The input is going tot be 1234567890
 LelouchVC2: Nooooo
 360hazzy: another way i did it
 LelouchVC2: Don't create your own variables
 360hazzy: ohhhhh
 360hazzy: waitwait
 LelouchVC2: It's going to give it to you
 360hazzy: this way i did it like this...
 LelouchVC2: Just take in input, think of it as linux redirection 
 360hazzy: if($Test1 = 1234567890 )echo (123) 456-7890;?&gt;
 LelouchVC2: Just try to take in data from the user, and the site will give you the lines you see in test
 LelouchVC2: almost there, we're getting somewhere
 360hazzy: i did it that way
 LelouchVC2: That's just going to hardcode the outputs
 LelouchVC2: There are 2 sets of tests
 360hazzy: but when i copy n paste the code n changed the numbers its failing
 LelouchVC2: the ones it shows u, and the one it actually tests your program to do
 LelouchVC2: Once you hit submit, it tests ur program with the second set
 LelouchVC2: the first set of tests are just for you to test your program with
 360hazzy: i did
 360hazzy: FailureFound: NothingExpected:" (123) 456-7890"
 LelouchVC2: So what that clash wanted you to do was create a program that can take ANY 10 digit number
 LelouchVC2: and format it to a phone number style
 360hazzy: im not sure if im supposed to use the quotes tbh
 360hazzy: this is my 2nd day doing php
 360hazzy: i covered the netire syllabus
 360hazzy: entire
 LelouchVC2: Gay
 360hazzy: lol how
 LelouchVC2: cause php
 LelouchVC2: if you code php
 360hazzy: lol
 LelouchVC2: you have to do php
 360hazzy: this is the wonderful part of coding
 360hazzy: raging
 LelouchVC2: yee
 360hazzy: raging atm
 LelouchVC2: Anyway, try another clash of code
 360hazzy: nothing working
 360hazzy: ite
 LelouchVC2: ill join u
 360hazzy: yh i see u
 LelouchVC2: btw, the clash chat always closes for me at the start of the clash
 LelouchVC2: so if u talk to me on there i wont see it
 360hazzy: k
 360hazzy: i dont understand this N thing
 360hazzy: in yellow
 LelouchVC2: N is just a variable name
 360hazzy: n is just the interger?
 LelouchVC2: yes
 360hazzy: oh
 360hazzy: ok
 360hazzy: can i delete the mini code they put
 LelouchVC2: yea, but make sure you can take in all the input it's going to give you
 360hazzy: when they say number of throwers N does that mean ur supposed to say in other words...The number of throwers are x amount of throwers?
 360hazzy: ite
 LelouchVC2: Just a variable name
 360hazzy: sorry but im slow to learning in general
 LelouchVC2: There are N throwers, which is 2 in thee example
 360hazzy: bruh i dont even know how many throwers it has
 LelouchVC2:&#160;?
 360hazzy: for N
 360hazzy: the first one
 LelouchVC2: Every test case will have a different number of people throwing shit
 LelouchVC2: You need a program that can take in as many throwers as needed
 360hazzy: so i can put any amount?
 360hazzy: hmm
 LelouchVC2: The logic of the program shouldn't depend on how many throwers there are
 360hazzy: tbh my editor is blank
 LelouchVC2: Lmao
 360hazzy: u see this is y i started these games!!!
 360hazzy: because i not good with problem solving
 360hazzy: but i wanna do Cyber Security
 360hazzy: so yh gotta practise
 LelouchVC2: hmmm
 360hazzy: can i see ur code thus far
 LelouchVC2: It's in C++
 LelouchVC2: will it be useful?
 360hazzy: ik
 360hazzy: something so
 LelouchVC2: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2639569-1d2b-4eb5-a252-4ed2b0a21649">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2639569-1d2b-4eb5-a252-4ed2b0a21649</a>
 360hazzy: thanks
 360hazzy: oh u make a vairbale
 360hazzy: variable\
 360hazzy: gud job lol
 LelouchVC2: Now you can see the working code
 360hazzy: lol i give up yes this is too hard ill try a next one
 LelouchVC2: I was hoping for a simple one
 LelouchVC2: But it gave us this shitty one
 360hazzy: ikr
 360hazzy: next...
 360hazzy: wait is this chat going in the legit discord chat
 LelouchVC2: idk, doubt it
 360hazzy: hmm let me check
 360hazzy: no
 360hazzy: it dont have world
 360hazzy: i feel like im solving algorithms
 LelouchVC2: For the most part
 LelouchVC2: Not all clashes are like this, but a lot are
 360hazzy: bro i was looking for a simle one like test input 50040 and outs 499463
 Reksio: The War puzzle was quite annoying to understand but the most annoying part is that tests run in old language version (while IDE used a new one). They need to fix this puzzle description and running env or tell people it's mean to be annoying&#160;:)
 360hazzy: thats easy for beginners like me
 LelouchVC2: there's many like that
 360hazzy: im leaving
 LelouchVC2: we just happen to be on a streak of hard ones
 LelouchVC2: xD
 360hazzy: im gonna keep searching
 LelouchVC2:&#160;:(
 360hazzy: until i get a simple one
 LelouchVC2: okie
 360hazzy:&#160;??
 LelouchVC2: this one is simple though
 LelouchVC2: Not as simple as it could be
 LelouchVC2: But if you try I'm sure you can get it :3
 360hazzy: searching...
 360hazzy: my gosh now they are giving me stories
 LelouchVC2: lmao, ikr
 360hazzy: just a noob quesation please:sob:
 360hazzy: tbh i didnt know the programming life this tuff
 360hazzy: lol
 360hazzy: i never seen or heard or think problems like these before
 LelouchVC2: They're not very realisitic, they're just problems to solve
 360hazzy: ite
 360hazzy: now they talking about biology and nucleus
 360hazzy: is this the only game on this site
 LelouchVC2: Nah, plenty of puzzles you can solve
 360hazzy: ite bet
 360hazzy: fall  challenge
 360hazzy: thats a registration event
 360hazzy: oof cant wait
 360hazzy: im gonna do conditions
 LelouchVC2: okie :3
 360hazzy: i think i need to go at least 2 or 3 more days with practise of php
 360hazzy: before doing these games
 360hazzy: im good at java but i dont wanna do that it'll be too easy
 LelouchVC2: Yea, you've got this
 LelouchVC2:&#160;;)
 LelouchVC2: And the clash you left, I got 1st, but only got a score of 80%
 360hazzy: can u maike friends on this
 360hazzy: bruh
 LelouchVC2: You can "follow" people
 360hazzy: im gonna follow u
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: well, i'ma get off and waste my life playing video games
 360hazzy: follow back please
 LelouchVC2: already did&#160;;)
 360hazzy: yea i now about to say im gone
 360hazzy: thanks
 360hazzy: gonna brush my wave then code more
 360hazzy: cya
 LelouchVC2: okie, c ya later &lt;3
 danabanana: been a while since i did competitive programming.. i'm loving this clash of code thing
 Raghuveer: Can anyone help me in this code
 Raghuveer: python
 Raghuveer: the code is
 Raghuveer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/967c9535-12a2-48c7-a0ec-0558a3c94a3d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/967c9535-12a2-48c7-a0ec-0558a3c94a3d</a>
 Raghuveer: error second line
 danabanana: not sure which is which.. can you post the exact line here? and what's the error?
 Raghuveer: (input(question)
 Raghuveer: first line
 danabanana: parenthesis
 danabanana: (input(question)-1 missing parenthesis
 Raghuveer: what
 Raghuveer: is it
 danabanana: (input(question)-1)
 Raghuveer: (input(question)-1)
 Raghuveer: ok
 Raghuveer: def menu():(list, question): 
 Raghuveer: error in this now
 danabanana: syntax error?
 danabanana: print is a function so it should have parenthesis as well
 danabanana: print('something')
 danabanana: also why do you have print ')'?

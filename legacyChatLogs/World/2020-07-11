 eulerscheZahl: Happy Caturday
 Edwing123: Caturday&#160;?
 Edwing123: What is that&#160;?
 JohnCM: lol Saturday with cats?
 Edwing123: My cat has fleas
 Edwing123: Well it's not my cayt
 Edwing123: cat*
 eulerscheZahl: Caturday is an invention of jacek
 Edwing123: It's my grandmother's cat
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Haiit99: hello everyone
 jrke: jacek happy caturday
 Edwing123: Hello
 Edwing123: Who made the Power Of Thor ep 1&#160;?
 Edwing123: I'm stuck lol
 Edwing123: In the last two tests
 jrke: im just making my shorter in power of thor ep 1:smiley:
 jrke: my *code* shorter
 Edwing123: How many ifs did you use&#160;?
 Edwing123: I'm doing it with Lua
 Edwing123: The Straight up and Up are working fine
 jrke: im python code size 135
 jrke: ok
 Edwing123: my is 66 
 Edwing123: wait
 Edwing123: size what&#160;? file or lines&#160;?
 jrke: 135 code size
 Edwing123: where do you see that&#160;?
 jrke: means?
 Edwing123: Yeah
 jrke: so you have 66 code size?
 Edwing123: I mean, are you talking about the lines of code&#160;? or the file size&#160;?
 Edwing123: I have 66 lines of code
 jrke: oh
 jrke: im talking about code size 
 Edwing123: where do you see that&#160;?
 Edwing123: In this platform
 jrke: you can see your code size at bottom right of ide
 ManeatingBreakfastOfWisdom_e692: hay can some body help me
 Edwing123: Why&#160;?
 ManeatingBreakfastOfWisdom_e692: Horse-racing Duals i can not understand what should i solve in it
 WINWINWIN: Sure, we can help
 WINWINWIN: ManeatingBreakfastOfWisdom_e692, what they want you to do is find the smallest difference in the array and print it.
 ManeatingBreakfastOfWisdom_e692: i thing i have to create an array
 Edwing123: smallest different or element&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Smallest difference
 WINWINWIN: You want to find the closest strengths
 ManeatingBreakfastOfWisdom_e692: strengths defined as Pi right
 ManeatingBreakfastOfWisdom_e692: i got it it;s working well
 Edwing123: Can't we saved changes&#160;?
 Edwing123:&#160;:)
 Edwing123: Three hours trying this one lol
 Edwing123: Well maybe tomorrow I'll have a fresh mind
 Edwing123: don't know&#160;:'(
 MSmits: you save whenever you click play my code
 yellow12: :grimacing:
 Marchete: how's going MSmits? othello now?
 MSmits: hey Marchete yeah
 MSmits: finished 1st version yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: Marchete, the lost son is back
 MSmits: :hugging:
 eulerscheZahl: :ruler:
 Marchete: I'm usually stalking 
 Marchete: :eyes:
 MSmits: creepy
 eulerscheZahl: i saw you played GitC recently
 Marchete: me? nope
 Marchete: last submit was may
 eulerscheZahl: in May, somewhat recent
 Marchete: ah
 Marchete: well, and some other C# bots I resubmitted
 eulerscheZahl: and PED uncrashed his bot
 Marchete: last I did was some othello, not a lot more
 Marchete: he was crashed?
 Marchete: was he*
 eulerscheZahl: no more Python2 support
 Marchete: well, I'm not into these peasant languages
 Marchete: you know
 Marchete: but the C# broke some of my bots
 eulerscheZahl: i like python for smaller stuff
 eulerscheZahl: the language updated killed some of mine too
 eulerscheZahl: those were I use System.Drawing.Bitmap for visual debugging
 eulerscheZahl: Bandas where I allocate a lot of nodes, out of memory now
 eulerscheZahl: Mean Max where I did you runtime optim trick
 eulerscheZahl: but I resubmitted all of them
 Marchete: I only resubmit when I see a sudden drop in rankings
 Marchete: yes, I'm that lazy
 MSmits: ohhh so thats why you did c++ on Bandas. You were forced to :grin: 
 eulerscheZahl: took be a while to notice my broken Bandas too
 eulerscheZahl: I still use C# on Bandas :D
 MSmits: really
 MSmits: mmh ok
 eulerscheZahl: C++ only for UTTT, STC, Bulls&amp;Cows
 eulerscheZahl: STC because I wanted it, the other two because I needed that extra performance
 MSmits: oh right, you just did a bit board on bandas
 MSmits: i thought it was c++ too
 eulerscheZahl: C# has bit operations too
 MSmits: i know my first uttt bot was C# and had a bitboard
 eulerscheZahl: took me way too long to realize. Bought a C# book back in 2011. Didn't even mention bit operations
 Marchete: is the new C# faster?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: i think it has access to some intrinsics and such as well?
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm like dbdr now: crashing in IDE
 MSmits: oh noes
 eulerscheZahl: i got some hate during the pacman contest
 eulerscheZahl: too bad they fixed the
 MSmits: ahh yes
 Marchete: what's that #if DEBUG?
 eulerscheZahl: i use it offline to only play 1 turn
 eulerscheZahl: CG compiled with DEBUG flag in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: so i crashed every IDE match
 Marchete: ahh
 Pambao: :smiley:
 Astrobytes: Oh welcome to Othello MSmits
 neverloose: hello
 MSmits: thanks Astrobytes
 WINWINWIN: Wow, dbdr has a decisive lead.
 WINWINWIN: Neural Network?
 Astrobytes: It's alphabeta, but uses Multi ProbCut, which uses stats obtained through multiple linear regression to obtain optimal alpha and beta values, causing optimal pruning and whatnot, hence the name
 Astrobytes: (that's maybe a little simplistic but you get the idea)
 WINWINWIN: So he gets a very high depth?
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/ProbCut">https://www.chessprogramming.org/ProbCut</a>
 Astrobytes: You use shallow searches to obtain the stats, and use the probabilities to affect the search window size at deeper depths
 MSmits: "Furthermore with ProbCut match results become more unpredictable and inconsistent: Apparently there are types of opponents against which ProbCut works very well and results in significantly improved results, but there are also other opponents (the tactically stronger ones?) where ProbCut has exactly the opposite effect. "
 MSmits: that's going to be interesting. 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's chess
 Astrobytes: It's more effective in Othello
 MSmits: right, but it might still cause some Rock paper scissors
 MSmits: pruning is usually hit and miss
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah absolutely, I mean 'probability' implies some inconsistency
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: It's been pretty solid so far though, will be interesting when robo and you improve more, and jacek too
 MSmits: this basically turns ab pruning into something more akin to mcts
 MSmits: stop searching bad branches because of earlier results
 Astrobytes: Yeah, in a different way, but essentially yeah
 MSmits: I'm gonna go with my UCTS 
 MSmits: I'm more interested in seeing what n-tuples can do
 Astrobytes: i am keen to see the results
 MSmits: yeah, going on vacation soon though, dont expect quick results
 Astrobytes: I'm here all year&#160;;)
 MSmits: do you have tree reuse Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: I have alphabeta
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Astrobytes: with ID and whatnot
 MSmits: I was going to write a tree reuse version, but i just figured out it will hit the end of my node pool halfway through the game
 MSmits: which is ok I guess
 Astrobytes: Just watch out for the pass moves
 MSmits: I use 6.5 million nodes on turn 1 :P
 Astrobytes: But you probably saw that 
 Astrobytes: lol, nice
 MSmits: yeah thats the only tricky part
 MSmits: my pool is 20 million
 Astrobytes: Same as my Oware pool
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: i think i could go up to 23-24 million but why bother
 MSmits: it will reset once and thats that
 Astrobytes: Yeah I don't think it'll be an issue
 MSmits: I could also do the uttt gamble
 MSmits: which is, just reuse the early nodes hoping you dont overwrite anything thats in use :P
 Astrobytes: lol, I'd be careful with that
 MSmits: well it's easy to see when it fails
 Astrobytes: That is very true
 MSmits: you get nodes pointing to themselves with infinite selection
 MSmits: node loops
 Astrobytes: Yes I had something similar going on in my early Oware days
 Astrobytes: brb, coffee
 MSmits: if you know it can happen its easy to fix. If it starts happening 2 months later because you increased performance, you're in for some trouble
 dbdr: MSmits, isn't the self loop just a possibility?
 dbdr: you could have invalid links without that, no?
 MSmits: you can, but you will still occasionally get some very long loops and time out 
 MSmits: with enough games and enough turns per game you start seeing more timeouts in your submits and tests
 dbdr: probalistic debugging&#160;:)
 MSmits: hmm also, you get invalid moves
 MSmits: because i keep the board on the node, it iwll just assume the board is different
 MSmits: that's assuming one of those bad nodes is the one selected to do a move with
 MSmits: but it will happen occasionally
 MSmits: and the mcts solver will start acting up saying you've won when you havent
 MSmits: so yeah, a huge mess :P
 MSmits: dbdr do you use TT&#160;?
 dbdr: sure
 MSmits: I am wondering how to use them effectively
 MSmits: you dont store every boardstate do you? 
 MSmits: just up do depth x&#160;?
 MSmits: the number of transpositions stored increases exponentially with depth, but the effectiveness of a deep transposition is worse than one at low depth
 MSmits: is this just a parameter you fit?
 dbdr: no, I store everything
 dbdr: a board state is just 128 bits
 MSmits: sure
 dbdr: also, the TT also helps later turns
 MSmits: but that still means you probably xor two 64 bit ints and put them in some kind of map
 dbdr: similar to tree reuse
 MSmits: maps get pretty slow and you have rehashes
 dbdr: yeah. that's not expensive is it?&#160;:)
 MSmits: i am more worried about the map when it gets big
 dbdr: I never rehash
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: do you keep seperate maps for each  turn
 MSmits: i mean
 MSmits: turn-depth
 MSmits: that would keep the maps small
 MSmits: you'd have 64 maps total
 dbdr: why would you want small maps?
 MSmits: doesnt it affect insertions and looking up?
 MSmits: the speed?
 dbdr: no, hashtable is constant time by principle
 jacek: dbd has rather ab not mcts?
 dbdr: ok, it does if you count memory caching
 MSmits: we're talking abou t TT
 jacek: TT size isnt issue here
 MSmits: small maps wont solve memory caching i think
 MSmits: because you're accessing all of them
 Astrobytes: my TT is fast, it just doesn't work properly right now (to put it lightly) :P
 dbdr: fast, correct, simple, pick any 2&#160;;)
 jacek: your TT works, it just doesnt have anything sensible to store
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: alpha beta values screwing me up a bit, I'll get it working soon
 MSmits: I have tried transpositions in mcts, for example checkers
 MSmits: but when i implement it, I halve my rollout count =/
 MSmits: in yavalath it works better because you get so many moves
 dbdr: probably speed is more important in MCTS because you rely on statistics over randomness
 dbdr: minimax is deterministic
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but that doesnt explain why the speed is halved
 dbdr: time spent hashing?
 MSmits: maybe so
 MSmits: I should dive more into this
 MSmits: to prevent rehashing
 MSmits: do you set a capacity at the start so it hashes efficiently?
 MSmits: I thought the rehashing happens because the map structure assumes you're doing a small map and it gets too big
 dbdr: yes, it is fixed
 MSmits: and you just guesstimate it right?
 dbdr: at startup
 dbdr: yeah
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: well that helps, thanks, I should do that too
 dbdr: I should tune it&#160;:)
 MSmits: I always use unordered map/set but I let it do it's thing
 MSmits: probably bad
 Astrobytes: I just use arrays
 MSmits: for a transposition?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: how does that work?
 jacek: badly
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: dont you need unordered access?
 MSmits: the boardstates are all over the place
 jacek: my TT is simple unordered_map, i clear it at the beginning of each turn. my hash is simple, i dont do zobrist and whatnot and i dont care about capacity
 Astrobytes: i do Zobrist, set my array size at the start, haven't run into issues with it. My problems lie elsewhere
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/267bd499-d333-469a-84eb-2db217882d20">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/267bd499-d333-469a-84eb-2db217882d20</a>
 MSmits: isnt that how you make a good hash key?
 jacek: i also but currentPlayer
 jacek: put
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: though i wonder if the same board can happen with different player
 MSmits: hmm yes, but thats because it is Othello
 MSmits: pass turns
 MSmits: in yavalath, every board state can have only 1 player
 jacek: ah well, then its not needed
 MSmits: oware is different also
 jacek: but yeah, my hash is simple as that
 MSmits: thats why i hash "turns left" with the board state in oware
 MSmits: xorshift scrambles up one of the boards, really should be enough
 MSmits: if you just use p1 ^ p2 it's really bad
 jacek: mine is more like A * p1 ^ B * p2 ^ C * currentPlayer
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: dunno what that does
 jacek: just to prevent collisions. A B C are some random prime numbers
 MSmits: ahh ok
 dbdr: p1 ^ p2 is the same as p1 | p2, hopefully :D
 MSmits: yeah, thats why it's bad&#160;:)
 MSmits: 	states.reserve(1000000);	states.max_load_factor(10);
 MSmits: hope that helps
 MSmits: wont rehash unless it goes over 10 million, that cant happen anyway
 yellow12: :sunglasses:
 avidox: p
 Washier: MSmits, see you're on the Othello board and very strong from the start. DIdn't expect anything less of course&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: I just made tree reuse work a minute ago
 MSmits: not sure if it will help much
 eulerscheZahl: actually i'm disappointed by your current performance :P
 MSmits: lol
 Washier: kinldy share your methods?
 Washier: short description for noobs like me 
 MSmits: sure I did that yesterday, it's the same kind of bot I do for most board games these days
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS then
 MSmits: is mostly like mcts, but instead of random rollout, i eval each child and backpropagate the result
 Washier: mcts\minimax
 Washier:&#160;?
 MSmits: neither I guess
 MSmits: it has traits of both
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS with limited depth
 Astrobytes: UCB guided tree search
 struct: ept but eval all nodes on expand
 MSmits: yeah what Astrobytes said
 Washier: UCB?(sorry)
 MSmits: its the function you use in mcts
 MSmits: to determine what node to select
 Astrobytes: Upper confidence bound (applied to trees = UCT)
 MSmits: so instead of doing it bfs style like in minimax, you go deeper on better nodes
 Washier: ty
 MSmits: or at least nodes your bot thinks are better
 MSmits: based on statistics
 Washier: so move ordering in minimax setting?
 MSmits: mmh not exactly, with move ordering you still have 1 depth setting
 Washier: ok.
 MSmits: in my tree, some nodes may be 20 deep and some only 5
 MSmits: leafs i mean
 Washier: ok. jeepers.
 MSmits: its similar to how you cut off with ab pruning i suppose, but ab pruning never goes this deep and does a better job of reliably cutting bad branches
 MSmits: if the eval is working correctly, you can also solve quite well with mcts
 MSmits: mine goes 15 plies deep sometimes, sometimes a little less
 Washier: think i understand. learning more, so good
 MSmits: it's better to start with vanilla mcts i think if you want to learn it, even though my method is probably less code
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: To get to know and understand how it works
 MSmits: but do it for a game where it works well, like uttt
 MSmits: gives you some sense of accomplishment
 MSmits: btw Astrobytes, on a fast cpu I have to reset tree ones
 MSmits: once
 struct: uttt might be a bit hard to get legend though with C#
 MSmits: on slow cpu i dont
 Astrobytes: Yeah?
 struct: just make your eval heavier&#160;:)
 Washier: hell, most things are hard with my skills and C#.
 MSmits: C# works very well in most Arena's
 MSmits: the nr on this site does almost everything with C#
 MSmits: rn 1
 MSmits: i cant type for :poop: today
 Astrobytes: Didn't you get legend in UTTT with C# MSmits?
 MSmits: yes, back when it had 37 people in legend i got to 20 something rank with it 
 MSmits: probably translates to 50 or so now
 MSmits: maybe worse
 struct: but was it vanilla mcts?
 MSmits: but i was pretty obsessively optimizing it
 MSmits: yes it was, totally vanilla
 Astrobytes: I remember&#160;:)
 Washier: I've been given some some awesome advise last few days.  skills to implement it still lacking tho. one idea has stuck - go back to C. i miss pointers
 MSmits: C++
 MSmits: you want to classes
 MSmits: those
 Astrobytes: C++ is handy, you can write C and use any handy C++ features when you feel like it
 Washier: ok cool. 
 MSmits: when I use C++ I think its almost like coding C
 eulerscheZahl: C# got faster on CodinGame thanks to release mode and .net Core
 MSmits: I have probably just 1 class, sometimes 2 in my bot
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl but also, most of the time, performance is not the biggest bottleneck
 MSmits: except on these boardgames I guess
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 Washier: is it worth it for 2 classes? i'm comfortable with C
 eulerscheZahl: that might be why i'm not doing well in these board games
 struct: you can use structs
 struct: same thing
 MSmits: if you've been using C#, you want to keep some of the features of it dont you?
 Washier: doubt it
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I am pretty sure you would get some ranks in every one of these boardgames if you converted
 Washier: not really. my C# uses List&lt;int&gt; max
 eulerscheZahl: i'm always sad when i strip LINQ from my bots for performance
 Washier: exactly
 Astrobytes: I usually just put everything in structs, don't really need the access modifiers
 MSmits: in C# a struct is a completely different thing
 Washier: its not the same yes
 MSmits: so i tend not to use structs in C++
 Astrobytes: (was talking about C++)
 eulerscheZahl: let's do an experiment MSmits. Bandas or Langton. choose a game and I will convert
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: but this is why i dont use struct in c++
 MSmits: because i get confused moving between C++ and C#
 Astrobytes: the only difference is structs are public by default and classes are private by default
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl definitely bandas
 Washier: i meant C# has structs and unsafe and all that but its not C.
 eulerscheZahl: reasonable, more spots to climb over there
 MSmits: i mean mostly because its a much cleaner experiment, many players using the same kind of bots. Langtons is a mystery. Pretty sure performance is not a bottleneck there
 eulerscheZahl: my bot has almost 300 lines :scream:
 MSmits: the top guy isnt even C++ in langtons is he?
 eulerscheZahl: Java
 MSmits: right, so that would be a bad test
 eulerscheZahl: MonoDevelop doesn't support C++ anymore, what IDE should I use :thinking:
 MSmits: I have a :poop: ton of rollouts in langtons ant and i get nowhere near him
 MSmits: no idea I am on windows
 Astrobytes: VS code?
 eulerscheZahl: i have that installed at least
 Hjax: i really dont understand why just mobility is my strongest heuristic 
 Hjax: its what i have uploaded right now, and its roughly the same rating as smits mobility + frontiers + corners 
 Washier: it rules my eval Hjax, for what its worth
 Washier: hey, you improved a lot Hjax. wd
 Astrobytes: MSmits 'a9' is not a valid Othello action
 Hjax: i havent changed anything for like a week 
 Hjax: i submitted a few weaker versions with more complex evals 
 Hjax: but then reverted back to this one 
 MSmits: a9&#160;??
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I rank above you with a9&#160;??
 Astrobytes: I lost the replay, but if it's any help you passed a bunch of times first and it was near the end
 MSmits: ohh
 struct: you made multiple a9
 MSmits: weird
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476671464">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476671464</a>
 Hjax: heres an a9 replay 
 Washier: ok. yes, its really close around 10. i had the same experience, best bot resubmit raking very diffrent
 MSmits: how many times are you guys gonna say a9
 Astrobytes: a9 times
 Hjax: at least once more, a9
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: thanks for noticing. Probably the expert rule thing
 Washier: Robo should join kaggle once have more langs. He rocks with NN's
 MSmits: not sure if he's good at them in general, but he sure has the alpha zero kind down
 MSmits: mmh I think I know why it does a9
 MSmits: it somehow thinks there are no legal moves and then the bitIndex = 64. that leads to a9
 Washier: he understands the convolutional bits, and how to train.  good chance he builds the best eval functions
 MSmits: Agade and re curse are also quite good
 MSmits: check out Oware, all 3 of them are at the top with different kinds of NNs
 MSmits: re curse has a nr 1 NN at CSB
 MSmits: and in BR2k
 MSmits: he also made his own framework for training and such
 Washier: jeepers. yes, tackling oware as soos as othello  obsession wears off&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's a fun little multi, sim is a little weird
 Washier: if i can shift bits i would be happy
 MSmits: much shifting 
 MSmits: but it depends on how you do your sim, i also use a lot of lookups
 MSmits: like "if you choose pit 5 and have 10 seeds, these are the pits that receive seeds" 
 MSmits: cheaper than looping around with a lot of conditions
 Washier: i'm sold
 Washier: is it just me or are 2 player board games created by members a new thing. when i started there weren't any. love it to bits
 MSmits: its not super new, but maybe a year or so
 MSmits: and it's not necessarily board games
 MSmits: you can make anything
 MSmits: but board games have little art and are still very interesting
 MSmits: for a board game with good art check out Onitama, which is also very interesting
 Washier: yes i see. just a big fan of the 2 player perfect info kind i suppose. Onitama after otera, so many hours of fun ahead.
 MSmits: yeah
 Washier: suppose,  most of the bot games are 2p perfect info. 
 MSmits: not exactly, our last few contests weren't
 MSmits: and they turned into arena games
 eulerscheZahl: contests are rarely board-game like
 Washier: yes, oceans was super interesting
 eulerscheZahl: and if they are (wondev woman), they add fog of war
 eulerscheZahl: but thanks to the community there's a wide range of games to choose from
 Washier: enjoyed wondev woman. made gold in C# with &lt;300 lines. 
 MSmits: euler and struct being the biggest contributors I think
 eulerscheZahl: i really struggled with legend there
 Washier: is chess fitting?
 Astrobytes: struct might do chess 
 Washier: said it before. awesome commnity.
 eulerscheZahl: i borrowed struct from my own project atm, he's busy
 eulerscheZahl: for, not from
 MSmits: ohh
 Astrobytes: And after that he still has to do Amazons, Lines of Action
 MSmits: you confiscated struct?
 eulerscheZahl: for now, yes
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Washier: saw that yesterdasy. struct is, like we would say here "'n yster"
 MSmits: dunno what that is
 Washier: (an iron)
 Washier: solid
 MSmits: oh right, he's solid allright
 MSmits: not sure what he does for a living, but whatever he does, they're not paying him enough
 Washier: agreed
 Astrobytes: Still studying iirc?
 Astrobytes: He is awesome whatever he does
 Washier: iirc? if i may ask
 Hjax: if i remember correctly
 eulerscheZahl: if i remember ...
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: dammit
 Washier: ty
 Astrobytes: He got us both euler
 Washier: getting old
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 Washier: hehe
 Hjax: im apparently a youngun around here 
 Astrobytes: Meh. Old enough :P
 Hjax: :P
 Washier: not sure how people are. im 41
 Hjax: im 23
 Astrobytes: 37 here
 Washier: impressive
 MSmits: I dont know my age, only my birthdate
 MSmits: let me get a calculator
 eulerscheZahl: i'm between Hjax and Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the darn function suggestion box keeps getting in my way in the new IDE, suggestions?
 MSmits: 39 it seems
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Hjax: copy and paste from a proper ide @PatrickMcGinnisII
 Washier: well who knows. when i started studying, java 1.1 was the sheet. world is uspposed to go forward. good to see
 Astrobytes: that's so you MSmits, not knowing your age :D
 Hjax: @MSmits i cant picture you as not an old man because of your profile picture 
 MSmits: well my age is not a constant, but my birthdate is
 Astrobytes: Can't argue with that!
 Washier: haha he must be absent minded prof.
 MSmits: thats fine Hjax
 MSmits: mostly yeah Washier
 Washier: absent minded is a compliment
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall young, I'm 49 ... my internet was FIDOnet
 Washier: noice
 MSmits: Fido&#160;? thats like a dogs name?
 MSmits: did dogs rule the internet before cats?
 Washier: haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You will never know the struggle of 300baud ... count your blessings
 Astrobytes: Old-ass BBS veteran
 Washier: yes BBS
 Astrobytes: I still remember BBS's
 MSmits: it's BS with an extra B
 Washier: ah
 Washier: when i was 18, browsing the internet was an occasion
 PatrickMcGinnisII: We shared 8-bite games illegally and war-dialed everyone...the real anon
 MSmits: my first experience with internet at home was everquest addiction
 Astrobytes: That's how I remember it, my friend's big bro was into all that
 Washier: haha
 Astrobytes: He even installed an electronic keypad lock on his door
 Washier: and now we have twitter.
 MSmits: was it a steel door?
 Astrobytes: Always pranking people and messing with the phonelines
 Washier: not sure all of it is progress&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Absolutely Washier
 Hjax: its funny how profile pictures bias my opinion of people, i was expecting smits to say he was in his 50s 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: OG advice, take care of your teeth, stay away from Mountain Dew
 Washier: haha
 Washier: teeth yes, very true.
 Washier: listen to him
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i had dental surgery yesterday, can a dude get a painkiller?  no.
 Astrobytes: Poitín is great, what ya on about
 Astrobytes: The real mountain dew
 Astrobytes: Rots ya liver not yer teeth :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: What is todays version of Silk Road?
 Washier: well that escellated quickly
 Astrobytes: There are quite a few, mostly quite specialised and invite only
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hangovers vary Astrobytes ..poitin
 Astrobytes: Not that I use those services, but I'm aware
 Washier: of course
 Washier: same here
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII True
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can't stare at a screen with a buzz
 Washier: hehe
 Washier: i grow my own, lets call it salad. legal here. find it's all you really need if you're into that. growing things also a very relaxing hobby.
 Astrobytes: Nice. Did that many years ago, got into growing...fungus, and extracting from bark after that. Growing the fungus was very enjoyable.
 Astrobytes: Did some straight up cooking ones too, wanted to do shiitakes and stuff but stopped
 Astrobytes: Fun times!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Just finished Fun With Set Theory during all the bullshitting, don't fall behind...;)
 Washier: yes, mushroom growing is interesting. very different, almost no light. think the enjoyment of seeing something growing out of nothing is universal. 
 Astrobytes: Totally agree. Anything mycology-related I dig. Sadly can't grow any veg or whatever where I am currently, used to grow a ton.
 Washier: also find it a great stress reliever because its so different form software job
 Washier: to cold?
 Washier: *too
 Astrobytes: Nah, chemical factories nearby
 Astrobytes: I don't trust the soil nor the air.
 Astrobytes: Fine for growing plants though.
 MSmits: thankfully you can still type while holding your breath
 Astrobytes: lol, I never thought I'd ever have to move back to this place
 Washier: haha
 LovelyGhostVanDerSwag_9711: where to introduce standard input?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CS people need low maintenance housework and access to Wingsuits
 Astrobytes: Speaking of "too cold", I discovered today that bok/pak choi grows very well here in Scotland
 Hjax: i just looked up your climate, cold and went 
 Hjax: wet*
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's pretty crap in that respect. You get used to it though.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :bacon:
 Astrobytes: I prefer hot, but hey, can't have it all.
 Hjax: i live in New England, which has very nice weather 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes I'll trade houses for a few months
 Astrobytes: lol, you'd regret that Patrick
 Hjax: i dont think he would 
 Hjax: looks like he lives in Florida? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gotta feed my cats and my dog
 Hjax: basically the apocalypse there right now  
 Astrobytes: pmsl, perhaps not :D
 Astrobytes: Quite.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, its calm here...i'm near legoland
 Hjax: i just mean with the coronavirus 
 Hjax: being pretty out of control in FL 
 Astrobytes: I was gonna say, does LegoLand have antiviral properties :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My gf and I have roots in the UK.
 Astrobytes: Whereabouts?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: covid... oh it's a pain
 Hjax: ive never been to europe, i hope to go visit someday 
 Hjax: when the world is less of a mess 
 Hjax: no one wants americans to visit right now :D 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: She's more scot and I'm more Irish...so  its a mashup
 MSmits: i didn't want them to visit before that :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's so many great countries to visit. I hope you get the chance Hjax
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 MSmits: unless they were you of course Hjax
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i've been there b4
 Hjax: aww thanks :P 
 Astrobytes: Good combo PatrickMcGinnisII
 Washier: where i live you cant complain. its minimum 3C this winter, 18C afternoon. summer its 20-34
 MSmits: almost the same here
 Astrobytes: Nice comfortable climate
 Astrobytes: I liked the climate in London, summers were nice and hot
 Washier: most people here have never seen snow
 MSmits: it's a little bit colder here sometimes in the winter
 MSmits: sometimes snowy
 MSmits: but rarely
 Hjax: ah it snows a lot here 
 Astrobytes: Snow would interfere with your tulip-powered windmills
 Washier: played in snow once - was dissapointed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Imma tell u something wierd.... if your ancestors are from a colder climate and you move to tropics...its more likely that you will develop mitochondrial issues, like diabetes and stuff.  It's a theory of mine, since I'm falling apart living in FL
 Washier: haha
 MSmits: think I fixed my a9, what a pain. I was converting chars to int wrong with - 1 instead of - "1" and I was also assuming I would receive my own pass turns as well
 Hjax: most winters we get about 40 inches total
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I felt great in UK
 Washier: Patrick, interesting
 Hjax: my ancestors are german and italian 
 Astrobytes: Since I've moved back to Scotland from a warmer climate I'm falling apart so...
 MSmits: people in the western world just eat crap and half of them get diabetes
 Astrobytes: Mostly true
 MSmits: my father and mother both have it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll take ketchup over that damn brown sauce
 Washier: agreed. and not enough excercise
 Astrobytes: Not being able to exercise is killing me right now, putting on weight and everything
 MSmits: I'm hoping to dodge the diabetes by eating like a true coder
 Washier: less manual work to do though, so partly our fault
 MSmits: sucks Astrobytes&#160;:(
 Washier: what does a true coder eat? fish?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: who is nameless?
 MSmits: powder shakes
 Astrobytes: Oh I forgot about your liquid food MSmits
 Hjax: i think a true coder eats nothing 
 MSmits: yeah
 Washier: haha
 MSmits: i drink only :P
 MSmits: well almost
 Hjax: because they are too engrossed in their code and then they forget to eat
 Washier: haha
 Hjax: at least i do that 
 MSmits: sometimes that happens yeah
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 Washier: true. my wife is constantly annoyed with me for not being hungry,
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I lived on MountaIn Dew for 10 years, don't do it
 MSmits: i think thats called having a good marriage
 Washier: actually i am at that point, but sheet
 Astrobytes: Same with coffee for me, with added guarana often
 Washier: so hungry, but must read this..
 MSmits: guana?
 Washier: be careful with the guarana
 Washier: ca hike bloodpressure. my ail
 MSmits: isnt that like bat poop?
 MSmits: whats guarana?
 Astrobytes: I gave it up years ago
 Washier: haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: coffee is different, that keeps me from going postal
 Washier: and supposedly not that bad if not abused
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn stitches in my mouth, I'm so hungry...damn jello
 Astrobytes: I still drink coffee, vastly reduced intake though
 MSmits: going postal is when you decide to stop replying to e-mails and instead post letters to reply to them
 Washier: i mean, apparently. new study shows haha&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 Astrobytes: Everything in moderation I say. Apart from chillies. Can't have too many of those.
 Washier: MSmits submitting
 MSmits: i just fixed my a9
 MSmits: wont be any miracle submit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Picante is a natural pain killer, helps to releaase natural endorphines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: same with chillies
 Washier: chillies are good. also believe in curry, lots of spices
 MSmits: this is like religion to you guys
 Washier: we eat lots of curry
 Astrobytes: I live almost exclusively on curry or other hot and spicy foods
 Astrobytes: My spice cupboard is enormous
 Washier: haha same here.
 Washier: we have mace ffs
 MSmits: isnt that what you use to chase away rapists?
 Astrobytes: It's the outer part of a nutmeg
 Astrobytes: (not the shell)
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Astrobytes: Epic flavour and aroma
 Washier: yes. not sure about the rapists stuff? haha. 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_(spray)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_(spray)</a>
 Astrobytes: Mace spray is just 'pepper spray' right? Capsaicin aerosolised?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_(bludgeon)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_(bludgeon)</a>
 MSmits: also works on rapists
 Washier: oic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: see mace on NBC news every night
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah, all those people running around with foodplates hoping to catch free spices
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Washier: wow
 MSmits: NBC news&#160;!= msnbc right?
 MSmits: I mostly see msnbc when I see the protest stuff
 Washier: not offensive because i'll admit im very privileged here in SA. i have battery backup&#160;:) 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: FB paying a $5 B fine? holy shit
 MSmits: for what Washier?
 MSmits: the backup?
 Washier: regular power cuts
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: wow
 Washier: substations blowing up, cable theft
 MSmits: I dont even have candles I think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: true msnbc is more sensationalist
 MSmits: I'm one foot into the dark ages 
 Astrobytes: No candles? That's just asking for it. I have candles and no lighter since I stopped smoking.
 MSmits: oh but i am moving to a new house, it has solar panels, so thats good
 Washier: noice.
 MSmits: you can make a fire if you run 4 concurrent meta mcts and hold the candle at the back of your PC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm expecting at least 1 bad hurricane
 MSmits: ah, we mostly have good hurricanes here
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: thats when they dont throw down the tree onto your house
 PatrickMcGinnisII: were yall talking about oware abapa b4 i chimed in?
 MSmits: 2 years ago there was a hurricane so bad half the trees where broken in the street next to ours
 MSmits: Othello I think PatrickMcGinnisII, but maybe oware as well
 Washier: best of luck. also privileged in Africa to have no earthquakes, tornadoes etc.  nothing like that. maybe drought.
 MSmits: there's a lot of crime though
 MSmits: afaik
 MSmits: in SE
 Washier: yes
 MSmits: SA 
 MSmits: I mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've been thru every bad storm,  i stood in the eye of Hurricane Andrew surrounded by devestation in S. Fla at 3am, never seen anything like it since.
 Washier: a LOT of poor people unfortunately
 Washier: that sounds intense Patrick
 MSmits: not just that, I also heard one time it has the city with the most rape victims in the world
 MSmits: not sure which city in SA this was
 Astrobytes: Yeah, SA, and Africa in general has it's own particular set of problems&#160;:/
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Can i go to SA and build a nuclear reactor in my backyard tho?
 Astrobytes: You can do that in US Patrick
 MSmits: it's not illegal 
 MSmits: just the refined uranium and plutonium is
 MSmits: but if you have a fusion reactor it's all fine
 Astrobytes: beat me to it lol
 Washier: yes. news is news but i would guess its Johannesburg(where i Live), 25% of population in the size of luxemburg
 Astrobytes: Yeah, fusion ftw
 MSmits: Washier yeah i think so, its pretty old news though, might be better now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Thorium
 Washier: whe have a lot of shit in the ground here. including uranium
 MSmits: :radioactive: :poop:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: No, they won't let me have a Hydrogen tank muchless a reactor
 Astrobytes: Is it still mined there Washier?
 Astrobytes: Uranium, I mean
 MSmits: we knew you didn't mean :poop:
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits a physics dude hating nuclear?
 MSmits: I don't hate it
 Washier: uranium, not sure. if there is any left, some British co would be mining it yes. But gold and platinum and some other stuff, we have lots. 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, quite a history of plundering the continent for precious commmodities
 MSmits: mine out the stuff, then fill the holes with CPU and mine crypto
 PatrickMcGinnisII: We have piles and piles of heavy metals in the waste from Phosphate mining
 Washier: Chinese trying to convince our gov to build nuclear - meanwhile, like i said, grid falling apart already. 
 Astrobytes: Could totally see that going really well.
 MSmits: why are the Chinese interested in building nuclear in SA?
 Astrobytes: They're interested building nuclear everywhere.
 MSmits: it's a fetish?
 Astrobytes: You're on form today MSmits 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: India is leading the way in energy reform because the US is over-regulated
 Washier: money  MSmits. gov is corrupt, they even admit it. but i'll stop there
 MSmits: I'm a bit tired I guess, my mind works differently :P
 Astrobytes: 99% of Africa's problems are due to corruption. Hell, make that the world.
 Washier: very true
 MSmits: there's different degrees of corruption though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Die Antwoord is from SA, yes?  Can't be that bad
 JBM: and different causes
 MSmits: when they find corruption in my government it's usually very tame
 Washier: here, they dismiss it as 'not being western'. stealing is stealing
 MSmits: well the voters become desensitized to it and accept it
 Astrobytes: Voting eh
 MSmits: we have a multi-party system. If two parties both have corruption, there's a bunch of other ones
 PatrickMcGinnisII: US is corrupt AF... choose between the orange faced man or an old fart.
 Washier: not necessarily. if you control the voters, you stay in power 
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: the voters choose to be controlled
 Astrobytes: Not everywhere.
 MSmits: true
 Washier: not if they are uneducated
 Washier: then they dont know
 MSmits: yeah lack of education is problematic
 terminator_t800: Hi
 Astrobytes: Not for them. For them it's got everyone right where they need them.
 MSmits: if only the well-educated could vote, Trump would have no base
 Astrobytes: Why do you think people are kept uneducated and in poverty?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I may say some wierd stuff, but there are some dumb MFs here
 Washier: yup Astro. 
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I can feel a rant coming on lol, I'll stop&#160;;)
 Washier: to cotrol them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the DOE is pushing privatization of schooling... its all about $, not people
 Washier: yes. its not conspiracy. just politics. which is not logical or helpful i feel
 MSmits: in the US the problem is mostly that the right is using cultural differences to get votes while screwing their voters out of everything else
 MSmits: many people are blinded by these differences
 PatrickMcGinnisII: teachers teach kids how to learn, if somone has the time and energy to self-study they usually will, but society is setup to keep people busy in a system of modern slavery
 Astrobytes: +1 Patrick.
 Acerbic: Power of Thor is too hard for me&#160;:( can't get below 70 Q_Q am I missing some super-hack?
 Schwase: as a second year physics major im glad to know what i have to look forward to
 MSmits: you mean you'll be like me?
 Washier: yes, +1 Patrick. what we need is more good teachers. tough job
 MSmits: yeah, who would want to do that though
 MSmits: seems crazy
 Schwase: idk i havent really been paying much attention to global
 Schwase: just passed donut case validator in plague but still failed the submission validator. niceeeeee.
 MSmits: dont remember the donut puzzl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My gf is an English teacher, they are pushing her back into a classroom soon...so she risks her life or she loses her retirement $
 Schwase: its the plague, jr puzzle
 Washier: best of luck Patrick
 JBM: great puzzle btw
 MSmits: the US is nuts with how your closely survival is tied to your job
 Schwase: yeah it really is
 Astrobytes: Yep, it's a terrible way to treat people
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i really slacked on Oware
 Schwase: nice self plug jbm
 JBM: O:-)
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: How's things JBM?
 JBM: mostly ok
 JBM: took a few days of vacation
 Washier: nice to meet you JBM
 JBM: to deal with the inlaws
 JBM: heya Washier
 Astrobytes: oh, fun times then
 JBM: well
 JBM: they do provide us in rum
 JBM: i suppose i can tolerate them
 Washier: haha
 Astrobytes: Aha. That's the ticket.
 JBM: rum is life
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jbm, when u make a puzzle can u see the submitted code in all languages?
 JBM: no
 Washier: rum is life, haha, i like pirate metal
 Schwase: patrick do you mean like a code translator?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i already did Plague, i gave it 5&#160;::stars::
 JBM: you rock
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Schwase, no..when u finish a puzzle u can see the solutions of your peers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i thought maybe if you made one, you could see all the submits...i guess not
 Schwase: oh so you mean does he still have to solve it first?
 JBM: in all languages you want to see the solutions for, yes
 Schwase: so puzzles dont need to have a solution to be approved?
 JBM: they do
 Astrobytes: They most certainly do
 Astrobytes: Or, should, indeed.
 Schwase: yeah so you can just submit your own solution code to see others' solutions
 JBM: in the same language yes
 Schwase: oh
 JBM: same as everyone else
 Schwase: i only code in java so i never checked
 Astrobytes: Shame on you :P
 Schwase: and i havent really felt a need to since im just grinding the easy puzzles rn
 Schwase: i need to learn c+ for a datastructures course this fall though
 JBM: yeah that feature is a bit unbalanced
 Schwase: and i do know SOME python
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I translated a few solutions into other languages, but its not fun for me
 JBM: it's usually not too useful to see a solution to a puzzle you already solved
 JBM: it could be useful/interesting to see how other languages do it
 JBM: and was actually how it was at first
 JBM: but CG has language badges
 Astrobytes: Unless it's a tricky problem that you did a hacky solution for and want to see a better way
 Schwase: idk, a puzzle that you dont have a really elegant solution for would be worth checking
 JBM: so people used the feature so get them
 Schwase: ^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cg encourages you to expand your knowledge
 JBM: and CG restricted to languages you already solved
 JBM: it was suggested long ago to open solutions' visibility to languages you already have the badge for
 JBM: but they don't seem to care
 Astrobytes: That would be a better way I think, yes
 Washier: ten foot pole. not touching
 MostComplicatedUsername: no one has a cotr bot
 Astrobytes: I swear you said that the other day MCU
 MostComplicatedUsername: 9 people
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There are alot of different styles even amongst same lang, but it would help to see a kotlin solution to an easy puzzle that you have already solved in C++
 MostComplicatedUsername: Did I?
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure of it.
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well that doesn't make it any less true :D
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: I think I submitted something there, but not a real bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MCU, want me to submit so you won't be last?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: lol sure :D
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I don't have a bot for it either, I just submitted to add another multi to my list
 Astrobytes: It's a (very) Rainy Day Multi for me
 ZadeTheExplorer: i am wonder that people prefer js and python more than java or other oop in ClashCode
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh crap, 4 players
 MSmits: dunno about js, but in python you can write a solution with very little code
 MSmits: less than java
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Well yeah no {}
 struct: I cant understand the formula that CG uses to make the number of battles for Community multies
 Schwase:&#160;;
 Washier: when its golf, langs like java\C# suck
 Schwase: yeah;
 Schwase: they do;
 Washier: Console.Write... and yuo lose
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sorry MCU, I'm not last
 struct: checkers 90 games 161 playerothello wood 2 83 games 35 playersothello wood 1 81 games 15 players
 struct: per submit
 Washier: othello woooo
 Washier: &lt;cheerleader outfit&gt;
 Astrobytes: Scary, scary image :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's a bit annoying struct
 Washier: hairy legs
 MSmits: struct could be a function of calculation time?
 dbdr: this 83 and 81 is actually 80
 dbdr: plus matches scheduled by others
 struct: yavalath also 90
 dbdr: I guess there are the addtiional 10 ranking matches
 dbdr: when league is above a certain size
 struct: I guess
 struct: well if othello wood 1 ever hits a certain number Ill open a new league
 struct: if the number is too big
 dbdr: the 10 ranking matches don't count in the&#160;%, they are special
 dbdr: wood 0?&#160;;)
 struct: One day we might have bronze
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct that would entail me getting out of wood2
 dbdr: would make sense for large commus
 Astrobytes: Proper leagues would be great. I think it might encourage more people. Perceived sense of achievement and all that 
 Schwase: 100% on plague
 Schwase: pretty proud of it too
 Astrobytes: gj
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gj Schwase
 Schwase: except that i reinitialized the network everytime i tried a new starting node
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gtg, mouth hurts.    "be good, or be good at it!"
 Schwase: that was pretty scuffed
 JBM: gg Schwase
 Schwase: ez
 Astrobytes: Later Patrick, take it easy
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: welp i submitted the same code again and got 80 so i barely even fit into the donut case LOL
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: E
 Astrobytes: I
 JBM: E
 Washier: k
 BorisZ: test
 Astrobytes: TEST FAILED
 Aravindhsiva: Hola amigos
 eulerscheZahl: compilation failed&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl:  /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccvj6ZLV.o: in function `main':bot.cpp:(.text.startup+0x784): undefined reference to `Board::childFrom'
 Astrobytes: multiple files?
 JBM: or simply an unimplemented method
 Astrobytes: Or static member
 Astrobytes: I would dearly love to rephrase that, but I cannot.
 eulerscheZahl: static member
 Astrobytes: Too much C#'ing has made you weak :P
 eulerscheZahl: screw it, i'll move it out of the class
 eulerscheZahl: hm, something is wrong with my bot&#160;:(
 jacek: degrade from class to struct
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476690716">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476690716</a>i see a 20% win chance while applying my last move
 eulerscheZahl: and my sim count in C++ vs C# arena is pretty similar
 eulerscheZahl: i'm using the pragmas
 Astrobytes: Fix it.
 eulerscheZahl: i'll outsource it
 Astrobytes: TeamViewer! :P
 eulerscheZahl: great idea MK
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: once a fellow codingamer even wanted me to connect to his PC - and I did
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i wouldn't trust myself enough to do it
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 eulerscheZahl: some C# console game, i found the bug
 Astrobytes: You could have 'found' many other things too most likely
 eulerscheZahl: syskey
 Astrobytes: :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: aw ffs, brb, cat vomit
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i know that
 jacek: too much Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: you have about 10s when the noise starts
 eulerscheZahl: at least to save your carpet
 MSmits: :nauseated_face:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's like the cat's 'beatboxing'
 Astrobytes: Wasn't too bad this time, she was chewing plastic again.
 MSmits: oww, you have one of them intelligent cats
 MSmits: i grew up in a house with 4 cats
 MSmits: all indoor cats
 Astrobytes: Yeah my two are mostly indoor cats
 eulerscheZahl: mine can go outside any time
 eulerscheZahl: but decides to stay inside a lot. maybe because of the neighbor cat?
 Astrobytes: So can mine, they're too scared though without me
 eulerscheZahl: mine likes to go outside with me too :D
 eulerscheZahl: and then marks the neighbors frontyards as her territory while i stand next to it
 Astrobytes: They tend to prefer your company over most things, funny little creatures
 dbdr: "my" cat is outside 99% of the time&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah
 Astrobytes: Ah you have a wanderer&#160;:)
 dbdr: well, she has me, rather
 Astrobytes: Bet she shows up at other people's doors/windows pretending she's hungry
 Astrobytes: Just to see what she can get&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that's what the neighbor's can does too
 eulerscheZahl: 5am and he finds a way into my room, cat fight starting
 Schwase: pro tip: before you spend 30 minutes investigating your code, dont forget (a+bi)^2 = a^2 + abi + b^2 isnt actually math
 Astrobytes: lol, now I know why you sleep earlier and get up earlier euler&#160;:)
 jacek: eyup
 Astrobytes: wwops
 Astrobytes: Or woops
 Astrobytes: Wrong button
 Astrobytes: ffs
 MSmits: hey jacek
 MSmits: i was thinking about what you said about TT and the player being part of the hash
 MSmits: I don't think it's necessary
 MSmits: because even if there happen to be two states with the same board configuration but different players, you will at most have 1 hash colllision there. 2 items in the same buckets
 MSmits: thats what the comparer is for
 MSmits: just make the comparison check. it's rare so it wont cost you
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee3f777a-cc2b-4c45-aa26-b21268e80f64">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee3f777a-cc2b-4c45-aa26-b21268e80f64</a>
 Astrobytes: Please, my eyes. Just:return (s1.p1 == s2.p1 &amp;&amp; s1.p2 == s2.p2 &amp;&amp; s1.player == s2.player)
 JBM: reads like haskell
 MSmits: hmm yeah thats better
 Astrobytes: No shit :P
 Astrobytes: I'll leave it at that.
 MSmits: fixed
 JBM: For Now.
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am trying to make TT work
 MSmits: but a little worried about something
 Astrobytes: I am in no position to criticise. I accidentally submitted.
 MSmits: on the one hand i dont want it to slow my bot down too much
 MSmits: but if does have to slow me down a bit, because I cant reset my tree
 MSmits: i need those nodes alive
 Astrobytes: I just need to fix my mouse aiming
 why_not_me: hey guys is there somewhere the code for an Starter Kit for cpp?
 MSmits: use a USB scope
 Astrobytes: lol
 JBM: int main() { return 0; }
 JBM: that'll be $20
 Astrobytes: #include &lt;iostream&gt; 
 JBM: whoa
 Astrobytes: +$5
 JBM: don't you push the budget like that
 why_not_me: in wood1 league you can chose here from some starters: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/csj/code-a-la-mode/tree/master/src/test/starterkit">https://github.com/csj/code-a-la-mode/tree/master/src/test/starterkit</a>
 MSmits: ahhh yes, some ex-contests have this
 why_not_me: unfortunately there isn't one for cpp
 JBM: it didn't deserve it
 JBM: why_not_make_one?
 MSmits: are you good with cpp why_not_me?
 MSmits: or completely new to it?
 why_not_me: I'm completely new to bots and coding challenges
 MSmits: Ok definitely dont do cpp then
 why_not_me: So it would help me big time
 MSmits: it's not beginner-friendly at all
 JBM: yeah do VB.net
 MSmits: do python or C# or something
 why_not_me: I have to... It's part of my university course
 why_not_me: It's amazing how much time you guys invest in mocking me instead of helping
 MSmits: do you have to do bots specifically?
 JBM: is a starter really the way to go then?
 MSmits: or can it be puzzles
 Astrobytes: I would suggest waiting until you know the language a little bit
 JBM: we're not specifically mocking you
 why_not_me: I have to do the code-a-la-mode
 MSmits: it's just JBM, he's annoyed cuz he got fired from the suicide hotline
 JBM: more like the absurdity of the situation
 Astrobytes: Really? In C++?
 JBM: and c++
 why_not_me: yes
 JBM: you have to do calm, but you can't code yet?
 JBM: that's some course
 why_not_me: who said i can't code?
 JBM: kinda you
 MSmits: what can you code why_not_me?
 Astrobytes: You do know some C++ at least right?
 MSmits: what are your skills/
 MSmits:&#160;;
 why_not_me: Okay, guys... thanks for nothing. bye
 JBM: lolnowait
 Astrobytes: emmm
 JBM: mmm
 MSmits: :snowflake:
 JBM: maybe we dodged a bullet
 JBM: maybe we'll regret this for the rest of our lives without knowing who to blame (but me)
 JBM: all we have to od now is wait for him to write the facebook-displacer
 MSmits: people should have thicker skin than this when asking for help
 Astrobytes: I blame myself really, and I'm slightly proud of that
 Schwase: i have a single easy puzzle left
 MSmits: awesomeness!
 JBM: let's replay the scene
 Schwase: unfortunately its pathfinder
 JBM: "is there a c++ starter?"
 JBM: "here's one"
 Schwase: and i havent done pathfinding in like 3 years
 MSmits: those are the best ones Schwase, great to learn from
 JBM: "other langs have it"
 JBM: "yeah but i'm new to ai and need one"
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 JBM: "use a beginners' lang"
 MSmits: he could have just coded a bot in whatever language he is familiar with and then convert it to c++
 JBM: "but i'm no beginner"
 JBM: [things kind of go wrong then]
 MSmits: it's partly the teachers fault though
 Astrobytes: I'm just having trouble with the 'fact' that he is supposed to create a C++ bot for CalM
 MSmits: who does this to students
 JBM: i suppose our wrong is to have assumed he was a beginner coder, when he was only new to AI/bots
 JBM: yeah that's another one
 Schwase: he was entitled
 MSmits: maybe it was acat :P
 JBM: not necessarily
 Astrobytes: That's why I asked him whether he knew C++
 JBM: he merely asked for availability
 MSmits: c++ is horrible for calm
 JBM: there wasn't
 JBM: but that's not his fault
 JBM: c++ is horrible for a lot more than calm MSmits
 MSmits: true, but calm is mostly a heuristic multi, its even worse to use c++ for that
 JBM: true dat
 MSmits: because there isnt even a plus-side to it
 Astrobytes: The way you do it yeah MSmits :P
 MSmits: no i actually did a search
 MSmits: beamsearch
 Astrobytes: I know!
 MSmits: ah ok, you and your memory bah
 MSmits: how can I tell the same story over and over if you wont let me
 MSmits: :cry:
 Astrobytes: Alright alright
 Astrobytes: One a week
 MSmits: so story short: Accept the damn plate when it's offered!!!!
 MSmits: this has to come out whenever calm is mentioned, sorry
 Astrobytes: where is that tumbleweed emoji
 MSmits: we need one of those
 MSmits: with animation
 MSmits: it's rolling over the screen
 MSmits: maybe a little windy sound
 Astrobytes: I agree. Despite my aversion to emojis I find I use them frequently on here.
 Astrobytes: Whshhhhhhh
 Astrobytes: I would leave CG if that became a thing
 MSmits: windy slunds?
 MSmits: sounds?
 Astrobytes: Any chat-based sounds 
 Astrobytes: Imagine a giggling sound everyone posted the (in)appropriate emoji
 MSmits: spammers would have a field day
 Astrobytes: it would be very 1990s
 Astrobytes: As long as they don't introduce 1990s ICQ sounds
 MSmits: i dont remember those
 MSmits: i do remember they made sounds
 MSmits: msn too
 Astrobytes: I don't remember them either, but they were annoying. Hated msn, ICQ was bad enough, only used it for SC players and a few other people
 MSmits: Star craft?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Original and Brood War
 MSmits: ah ok cool
 JBM: aaaah bw
 Astrobytes: GBR-1 crew
 Astrobytes: Fun times
 Astrobytes: We all met up at a theme park once, was a good laugh
 MSmits: sounds cool
 MSmits: my TT for Othello sucks&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Mine too man, mine too
 MSmits: i think it just sucks cuz it's supposed to
 MSmits: since I use UCT 
 MSmits: and such
 MSmits: with yavalath you have 40-60 children per node
 MSmits: and you do one check and store one TT per expansion
 Astrobytes: Mine is just not working, it's working better than it was but I'm gonna come back to it tomorrow, since I've had some beer now
 MSmits: Othello has far fewer children so I think I just have to check too often
 MSmits: I get about 20% less rollouts
 Astrobytes: I've never used a TT with any UCT-guided search
 Schwase: how many lines would it take you to make a pathfinder? just trying to ballpark if what i have in mind is way over the top or not. 
 MSmits: It only worked for me in yavalath
 MSmits: 10-20 lines
 Astrobytes: Are you doing Lost Child Schwase?
 Schwase: yeah
 Schwase: unfortunately
 Astrobytes: Just a BFS
 Schwase: 10-20 :O
 MSmits: well thats just the algorithm, getting the nearest neighbors can cost some lines
 MSmits: always go for BFS
 Astrobytes: It's really easy, honestly, straight-up BFS
 MSmits: I have a bunch of BFS implementations in C# you can find on the playground in my profile
 Astrobytes: I've not done the puzzle but I may or may nto have given the author my BFS code at some point
 MSmits: I 'm going to teach BFS to my students next schoolyear
 MSmits: only thing I am slightly hesitant at is that they dont know oop
 Astrobytes: What do you need OOP for?
 MSmits: the node
 MSmits: neighbors etc.
 MSmits: you usually use a class
 Astrobytes: hm
 Astrobytes: I see
 MSmits: there's probably a way to make it simpler
 Astrobytes: But it's a data structure
 MSmits: maybe premake the class
 MSmits: they only have to add it to a queue
 Astrobytes: It's just POD
 MSmits: pod?
 Astrobytes: plain old data
 Astrobytes: nothing fancy going on
 MSmits: we'll see
 Astrobytes: You don't even need a node class
 struct: why?
 struct: just have an array[n][n]
 MSmits: doing it without the node class might be more difficult
 Schwase: i hadnt heard of BFS or OOP or even A* before i had to look into solving this. im a physics major not a CS major. recently CS has been pretty appealing but i definitely need instruction in a class setting because im usually too lazy to read / get to understand code tutorials
 Marchete: in modern standards array are just bad practice
 Marchete: [n]?
 MSmits: Schwase I am also a physics major and I learned half of my coding in the last 2 years on this site
 Marchete: if it goes bigger?
 struct: whats the bfs for?
 MSmits: working with classes is not hard but you need to get past a small barrier, once you're past it, you'll love it
 Astrobytes: Just for teaching purposes struct
 Astrobytes: MSmits, you'll be teaching them the algorithm manually too I presume?
 Schwase: ive taken a CS course before and we did things such as "crazy bugs" but i have since stopped using external references with the exception of a few recursive puzzles that i couldnt do without them
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah i'll probably do some puzzles or something, something with pen and paper
 Astrobytes: Just a small graph is enough, a couple of points, or a small grid
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: show them connect 
 struct: 4
 MSmits: it's more natural to do a small maze
 Schwase: order of succession is a really good puzzle to show bfs
 Schwase: wouldnt you say?
 MSmits: hmm dont know that one i think, or maybe i do
 Schwase: the royal family tree
 Astrobytes: I learned this with nodes on a graph
 MSmits: i did all easy puzzles that were made before july last year
 Schwase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39c842c6-7f85-4336-85f3-e7b847225221">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39c842c6-7f85-4336-85f3-e7b847225221</a>
 MSmits: but they made new ones
 MSmits: sounds good
 Astrobytes: Grid would be an easy graph to do maybe, but maybe like visiting cities via roads. You can teach multiple graph search algos like t hat
 MSmits: i'll think about it after i get back from vacation. My idea is to introduce them to a lot of different types of AI
 MSmits: will also do machine learning
 MSmits: maybe just the tensor flow website by google
 MSmits: i want a hands on example of each but have to think carefully since they are not very skilled coders, most of them
 Astrobytes: For pathfinding, bunch of cities, linked by roads with distances (you can add other costs if necessary), demonstrate BFS, DFS, Dijsktra, A* approaches and do them manually on paper
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense
 Astrobytes: The differences become very clear when you do that
 MSmits: yeah dijkstra is nice to do on paper
 Astrobytes: Some good visualisations on redblobgames too, could be useful
 MSmits: that site is awesome
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476703481">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476703481</a>
 Astrobytes: It is yeah
 MSmits: i thought my solver was broken... but this is Ninja's fault right?
 struct: I would be more worried if it went from WIN to DRAW
 MSmits: yeah, I also just discovered a bug in my TT
 Astrobytes: Yep, that was a blunder
 MSmits: i was only recording the child index, not the maximum number of children
 MSmits: for yavalath i dont need to because the board tells you how many children
 MSmits: but for othello the child count veries
 MSmits: varies
 MSmits: maybe if i fix this it will magically become good :P
 Astrobytes: Good luck :D
 Astrobytes: See you all tomorrow guys, take care
 Schwase: seeya
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 struct: gn
 MSmits: I think it's crap. I'll just submit and hope the result is clear either way
 MSmits: I can cross it off my list at least
 plrp: Hi MSmits!
 MSmits: hi plrp&#160;!
 Schwase: so what im hearing is that the use of ArrayList might not be the go to way to solve this puzzle...
 MSmits: ah one of my students i think
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476704178">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476704178</a>MSmits
 MSmits: or at least at my school
 plrp: Yes, it's maarten
 MSmits: ohh cool
 MSmits: some free time finally then?
 plrp: Yes, finally!
 MSmits: thats weird struct
 MSmits: anything you want to try on CG plrp?
 plrp: I just felt like doing a simple coding puzzle, just to relax a little
 MSmits: ahh ok, so many to choose from
 MSmits: I dont puzzle that often
 MSmits: the pikachu puzzles are not bad
 MSmits: series of 4 puzzles that were part of a speed contest
 plrp: Oh, I'll try those then
 MSmits: it's just the 3rd one that has a bit of a twist that is not that easy to get from the description, but the first 2 are kind of relaxing
 plrp: I'll see how far I get, I'll start at part one
 MSmits: if you want a benchmark. I did the first one in 20 mins, the second one in 30 mins, the third in 45 mins and the last one took an hour or so. 
 MSmits: but that was highly stressed because of the 4 hr time limit. Take your time&#160;:)
 MSmits: might be it was a bit longer than i said, my total was like 3,5 hrs, i had half an hour left I think
 plrp: Ok, I'll take my time, I don't think I'll get around to the third one
 MSmits: nah dont worry about it, they are separate puzzles now
 plrp: Yeah I saw
 MSmits: btw, they are pathfinding puzzles and i am assuming this is easy for you
 MSmits: because i know you are a very good coder
 MSmits: you've done BFS and such before right?
 plrp: What does BFS stand for?
 MSmits: breadth first search
 MSmits: simplest algorithm for finding a route in a maze
 MSmits: or a path in  a graph
 MSmits: from A to B
 plrp: Oh, I don't think I have, but I've used similar algorithms
 MSmits: i think in this case its easier than this even
 MSmits: I think you're told to hug the left wall or something
 Schwase: yes
 Schwase: for the first one
 iSPANKzombiez: anyone willing to give help?
 MSmits: and keep track of which tiles you visited until you found your starting point
 Schwase: its L/R
 Schwase: what are you working on zombiez?
 iSPANKzombiez: Shadows of the knight
 iSPANKzombiez: batman level
 MSmits: thats binary search
 MSmits: jump to the middle point between current position and the edge of the map
 MSmits: if you're at x = 2 and it says East and  the edge is at x - 8, do (2 + 8 )/2 
 MSmits: if i remember the puzzle correctly
 Schwase: create four variables to express the upper, lower, right most, and left most points that are possibly the location of the bomb
 struct: basicly you want to elimanate the max number of points
 struct: with each move
 Schwase: ^
 OrangePeel: how can i print my own debugging messages into the code 
 OrangePeel: i.e. in the python code, i would like to add some print() statements of my own without conflicting with the expected output 
 tomatoes: file=sys.stderr
 plrp: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 OrangePeel: ah! cheers
 LoGos: remember to import sys

 Raynor1994: Hi all, I have a question. I have to do a technical assessment on JS and SQL under this platform. How likely am I to see the same or similar questions as the challenges listed here? If anyone did a TA in this platform before, any feedback would be really nice.
 Rodrigo_the_coder: javascript:
 Rodrigo_the_coder: console.log("any text")
 ATaco: The sheer variety of Challenge Questions will likely mean most if not all TA questions you'll've not done yet :P
 Raynor1994: so unless i solve literally every question then im not fully prepared
 miszu: do like 2-3 questions in JS and you should be fine
 Bikoko: Truong Sa and Hoang Sa are belong to Vietnam
 miszu: why unit testing is important
 miszu: I thought log() in c++ is the log base 2... but it's the natural log
 miszu: and I found out by unit testing
 LetchoHUN: Morning!

 ATaco: I love when you timeout in the Fall 2020 challenge and your witch just goes braindead
 Lysk: I have a preference for the witch stuck on a full inventory
 ATaco: My witch is more of a wizard; focuses more on learning spells.

 Automaton2000: you would have the same amount of time
 Rodrigo_the_coder: automaton2000 = kicker
 Automaton2000: so do you have time to do anything about it
 Rodrigo_the_coder: how to kick people
 Rodrigo_the_coder: in chat
 Rodrigo_the_coder: like this
 Uljahn: why do you want to kick people?
 ATaco: Just realized I had a logic error in which witches preferred to learn less effective spells then the ones they already knew.
 Rodrigo_the_coder: learn spell[effectiveness=Max]
 Rodrigo_the_coder: learn(spell[effectiveness=Max])
 rockstar555: very happy

 emh: I have an idea for an optimization multi
 Mohammadmh: hi
 Mohammadmh: :unamused:
 Illedan: Make it emh? :D
 emh: Illedan I'm inexperienced with that. I have open the page for contributio now. do you want to help me make the contest?&#160;:)
 Illedan: Sure can do&#160;:) 
 emh: Illedan shall we keep it secret or in public chat?
 Illedan: Send me a msg on Discord and we can continue the talk there&#160;:)
 emh: ok
 ZacDonald: Can somebody juste explain me something on the C4L chall&#160;?
 ZacDonald: the 'getCarried' var 
 Uljahn: pardun?
 Raynor1994: stupid question, when you are creating a new variable, are you reading it or writing it?
 Raynor1994: e.g. from Power of Thor: 
 KAIn: it means that you have to read that from the console. It is up to you to decide whether you then write that to a local variable
 Uljahn: if you don't read, then you'll read the remaining part on the next turn and become desynced
 KAIn: it is true for all the games here at CG
 KAIn: you must read all the inputs the engine provides
 KAIn: and you must provide (write to console) exactly as much outputs as the descriptions says
 Raynor1994: when i took a glimpse at the solution, it didn't use remainingTurns at all
 KAIn: to ensure that you stay in sync
 Raynor1994: other then the initial const declaration
 Raynor1994: im using JS btw
 Uljahn: you should perform IO-interactions in a specified order, but you're free to ignore some input values
 KAIn: the kickstart solution that you get in your IDE reads all the data for you. Whether you use those variables is up to you, but you should keep reading them
 Uljahn: ^
 ZacDonald: Can somebody help me on C4L chall&#160;?
 ZacDonald: im pretty stuck on 2 point here..
 Uljahn: ZacDonald: i didn't get your question earlier, i have no 'getCarried' var in the stun, maybe you should specify the language you use
 Uljahn: *in the stub
 ZacDonald: i use c++ langage 
 ZacDonald: and my question was 
 ZacDonald: how can i watch all turn the variable 'carriedBy'
 ZacDonald: because i want to know if the ID of the next folders is available or not 
 Raynor1994: I just finished it in JS without reading remainingTurns and got 100%
 Raynor1994: the solution provided is using python3 i believe and it didn't read it either
 Uljahn: ah yes, you could do that without reading all the inputs, but it's not a good practice
 rockstar555: how to create own coding puzzle
 Uljahn: ZacDonald: what do you mean? if carriedBy == -1, then that sample is in the cloud
 Raynor1994: how am i supposed to use that variable here? for loop?
 Raynor1994: for in range of rT?
 Uljahn: just read it and ignore
 emh: I was talking with Illedan about creating a contest. turns out the idea might be too complex for CodinGame. so maybe I will host a contest on my own server
 emh: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/emnh/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/blob/master/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/TranslatorForPattern.cs#L68-L235">https://github.com/emnh/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/blob/master/VB6ToCSharpCompiler/TranslatorForPattern.cs#L68-L235</a> for the type of data I'm interested in gathering from crowdsourcing / an optimization contest
 Uljahn: Raynor1994: as an example, starting leagues have unused inputs in some multiplayers on CG, which become useful later
 Raynor1994: As a mod, do you know anything about the technical assessments here?
 Raynor1994: I have one for JS + SQL due
 Uljahn: you've been answered on discord by the staff member, no?
 Uljahn: mods know nothing about CG compared to staff
 Raynor1994: fair enough
 emh: hmm.. simpler version of my idea using regex instead of CFG: given a list of source and target strings, determine a regex and a substitution that takes the sources to the targets. is it a known problem? does it have a name? like reverse regex but different? are there similar puzzles?
 emh: I'm not in much of a coding mood today, so just airing vague ideas hehe
 albie368: lua
 emh: found a bunch of articles and software by googling "generating regex"

 Death_Rock: yooo
 JohnCM: i only know of minimal edit distance
 AntiSquid: CG does SQL assessments too&#160;? cool
 VizGhar: Any recommendations on which game is easiest to reach legend?&#160;:) I'm looking for another motivation
 VizGhar: (i mean bot programming competition)
 AndreMarasca: is there any way to write latex in the Statement * field in "contributions"?
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar tron
 VizGhar: tnx
 AntiSquid: lol 
 AntiSquid: i am quite sure CSB is easiest @_@
 miszu: fun fact I learned yesterday while unit testing
 miszu: the log()in c++ is the natural log and not the log base 2
 struct: as it should :p
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup_tone5:
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid no its not&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: lol why not
 AndreMarasca: natural log is default
 ZarthaxX: CSB legend isnt that easy i would say
 ZarthaxX: but yes, we dont talk abotu the 3.. formula :D
 AntiSquid: to reach . not to advance
 ZarthaxX: i meant to reach too..
 struct: fc2020 easiest
 ZarthaxX: gold is easy to reach, but legend?
 ZarthaxX: struct lmao
 struct: it all depends on your skill level I guess
 AntiSquid: fc2020 has to be easier to reach than OoC where you have 1 month worth of improved bots
 struct: hard to say which one is the easiest
 miszu: also depends on your debugging skills
 ZarthaxX: ooc lasted 1 month?
 AntiSquid: in fc2020 i simply didn't do much aside from search next best potion and some few conditions
 miszu: AntiSquid no sims?
 VizGhar: I know it's hard to say&#160;:) but i like state machines and pathfinding, so CSB is not my way to go
 miszu: like graph searches?
 AntiSquid: well yes sim to get next best potion .
 miszu: CSB you need to use genetics algorithm
 miszu: some dark magic
 VizGhar: graph searching is funny too
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell</a>
 miszu: I need to do some research about multi agents strategies
 AntiSquid: but the simulation in SG (Spice Girls (fc2020) ) is much much easier than most games
 VizGhar: I've been coding some GA for my bachelor's... might be way to go as well&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar that's my boy
 ZarthaxX: you can do GA in CSB if you want :sweat:
 miszu: what algorithm works for high branching games?
 AntiSquid: is GA worth it? i saw the arguments of why MCTS is better and why not just stick to that&#160;?
 AntiSquid: you can do any extra form of hill climb with MCTS .
 ZarthaxX: i put that face because it's not the meta anymore hehe
 AntiSquid: for CSB legend i had a math formula . that's it btw 
 ZarthaxX: im still afraid of MCTS losing some potential good moves, but that's more critical on games where the score changes a lot in some moves
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid wow.... i did a lot of if else spaghetti
 ZarthaxX: :C
 AntiSquid: well you see i converted the if else into maths&#160;! 
 ParticleBeam: His math formula could be 3 pages long
 AntiSquid: that's next level if-else
 AntiSquid: keep up ZarthaxX
 VizGhar: @ZarthaxX I'll try every game probably :D
 VizGhar: MCTS is?
 AntiSquid: great
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquidi already lost it already
 ZarthaxX: monte carlo tree search VizGhar
 VizGhar: ah sure
 ZarthaxX: you would like that if you like graphs
 ZarthaxX: trying every game is a strong promise :D
 ZarthaxX: hard to keep up lol
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC announcement: "All participants in the second round will receive T-shirts, and the finalists will receive sweatshirts."

 AntiSquid: any conditional check can be included as:
 ZarthaxX: yes i know AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: so . 
 ZarthaxX: do you want me to do a big fat formula
 ZarthaxX: :D
 AntiSquid: do it
 AntiSquid: do your worst&#160;!
 ZarthaxX: i would prefer to go with the big bois algorithms hehe
 AntiSquid: you realize a NN is just a math formula right&#160;? 
 ZarthaxX: aha
 VizGhar: I'm going for an adventure... I loved GA but I was solving one ultra hard puzzle (some supercomputers are solving them a few years). Slightly discontinued from realtime processing :P
 VizGhar: and it was like 7years ago. I wonder how much effort it will cost me
 AntiSquid: so highlight 3D ... will there be sound like last year euler&#160;?
 AntiSquid: halite 3D *
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfImU0kAFI0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfImU0kAFI0</a>
 AntiSquid: not easy to observe how annoying the aiming was
 VizGhar: those sounds :D
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, we can get tshirt anyhow?!
 struct: I think raic said no shirts this year
 Illedan: euler said something about uncancel. Where did he read it?
 Illedan: I need to know if I have to work on that game :D
 wlesavo: Illedan they said there will be t-shirts for all half-finalists, and they comcerned about last year screw up, and promise to try to do better this year
 Illedan: screw up?
 Illedan: On which part?
 wlesavo: well it is said some people get t-shirts after a year of waiting
 Illedan: I didn't even get mine yet..
 wlesavo: oh, well this is it :smiley:
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: I want my sweatshirt!
 struct: anyone with experience on creating 3d models, which software do you recomend?
 AntiSquid: how do you feel about this halite clone?
 AntiSquid: i used blender because it's free
 AntiSquid: look up also unreal engine, i think it was free or there was a free version of it and you can do 3D models too, i didn't use that one, but the blender tutorial is long and there's a lot of detail to take into account struct
 struct: thanks ill check blender I think
 kovi: raic halite?
 kovi: or that is just preparation for the big battle between the 3d objects?
 wlesavo: no 3d
 wlesavo: and fog strating from half final
 wlesavo: starting
 AntiSquid: lol fog
 ZxxZ: hha
 Nerchio: fog is love fog is life
 reCurse: I was almost tempted too
 blasterpoard: in an RTS, I'd argue that it actually adds something to the game
 blasterpoard: not in RAIC though, because there's no techtree and scouting can only tell you how greedy the player is
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo 03:37PMwell it is said some people get t-shirts after a year of waiting
 wlesavo: lol restoring the image before the new contest :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile CG only has a women's version of the read stdin flush stdout tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: i guess it's the cube again then
 AntiSquid: gratz on the t-shirt euler
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 jrke: i hope spring challenge 2021 will give me a t-shirt
 eulerscheZahl: you got one already
 eulerscheZahl: for your winterthrone
 jrke: yeah hope its second t-shirt
 eulerscheZahl: which design did you take?
 jrke: cube one
 AntiSquid: community contests reward shirts?
 AntiSquid: or just organizers
 eulerscheZahl: community contest?promotion of an existing game
 eulerscheZahl: some streamers also get tshirts
 AntiSquid: ya w/e you want to call it
 struct: With competition increasing its a bit harder to get top 20
 AntiSquid: multiplayer party week ... better&#160;? :P
 eulerscheZahl: had a short look at instafluff yesterday (?) as the live thing was highlighted. he chose the cube too

 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Jrkej/CG-submit-predictor">https://github.com/Jrkej/CG-submit-predictor</a>. this one?
 eulerscheZahl: so you play some games on the server?
 eulerscheZahl: or how does it work?
 reCurse: It's like submitting except slower
 struct: I think it plays the games on ide
 struct: starting from bottom
 struct: similar
 AntiSquid: 'that's cool
 jrke: i am using trueskill for updating points and then choosing random opponent near that points and then again updating
 jrke: it takes your code in IDE and plays match like normal replays
 jrke: using CG servers
 kovi: slower for first rankbut faster for stabilization
 jrke: output is like this - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/735393675567431700/781908689023664158/Capture.JPG">https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/735393675567431700/781908689023664158/Capture.JPG</a>
 jrke: and after all matches it shows you total no. of wins,ties,loses and winrate and thefinal rank
 reCurse: To be quite honest you'd be better off directly batching against opponents near your bracket
 kovi: well, that is only for top3-10&#160;:)
 kovi: for lower the theoretical question: how can you tell where you are?
 reCurse: You submit and sample around your final position
 kovi: which few players to play against
 kovi: 100 games can be misleading both for you and the opponents around
 jrke: using trueskill i think kovi it gives an good estimate
 reCurse: I don't understand
 kovi: my point is, if you play more games with a wider range (like final legend recalc) it can give more reasonable rating
 eulerscheZahl: match_cooldown = 6#time in seconds to halt after each match
 reCurse: Sure, but from an improvement perspective it's better to batch against specific opponents sampled around your range
 reCurse: When you start &gt;60% them all you'll climb
 reCurse: Start over
 kovi: ok, i understand and you are right
 jrke: euler&#160;?? why you pasted that here?
 reCurse: So virtual submit is only wasting precious games imo
 eulerscheZahl: i think you will get blocked with the 6s delay. CGSpunk used 20s
 eulerscheZahl: and that's exactly when I stopped using it
 reCurse: Yeah the safe delay is 20s
 kovi: anyway...talking about delays...raice is 1 game per 20 minute or so...
 kovi: raic
 reCurse: So halite
 reCurse: Except significantly worse design
 eulerscheZahl: testing 1 per 20minand about 1 rated match each hour
 jrke: so should i make it 20 seconds instead of 6 seconds?
 struct: how many players does raic usually have?
 eulerscheZahl: a little under 1000
 eulerscheZahl: the 2nd easiest tshirt of the year
 struct: whats the easiest?
 eulerscheZahl: easiest is hacktoberfest obviously
 jrke: yeah my hacktoberfest t-shirt didn't shipped yet
 jrke: easiest t-shirt
 kovi: tshirt is easy, but hard to beat t1024
 eulerscheZahl: you did hacktoberfest?
 eulerscheZahl: by bullshit detector told me not to do it
 eulerscheZahl: my*
 jrke: i did hacktoberfest euler
 dbf: eulerscheZahl what is opinion of your bullshit detector about raic for this year?&#160;:)
 kovi: big prices
 BigBadGiantFromHell_6ea5: hi guys

 eulerscheZahl: yes. and different pit size + tileset
 AntiSquid: could just give out "error fix your code" otherwise it gives the impression it's your code that's faultybut ya it works with 0 0 0
 eulerscheZahl: the original game has different versions too
 eulerscheZahl: well, it's still not marked WIP because there's a lot missing
 AntiSquid: can you still move th tile once it touches the bottom&#160;?

 reCurse: Is it mutually exclusive with working on linux?
 JBM: i guess not&#160;:)
 reCurse: No I wouldn't dare asking stuff on SO, 99% chance of being blocked/closed
 JBM: that's still a 1% risk of getting a useful answer
 AntiSquid: i agree, was wondering if you tried :P
 miszu: AKCHUALLY this is a duplicate post. Please look at X link
 reCurse: Well the same question has been asked multiple times
 reCurse: Problem is the answer are all several years old
 eulerscheZahl: short poll: who here ever asked anything on SO?
 reCurse: And they quote a manual where the said quote can no longer be found
 reCurse: Wasted the last hour trying to figure this out
 reCurse: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 miszu: you could create a post saying the old posts are old and if something changed today
 miszu: that would be reasonable
 JBM: i ask shit on SO pretty often
 AntiSquid: I DID and i gave a disclaimer that the answers on google don't answer my problem and first post was&#160;: "hey you could have googled this" with a link to WRONG answer eulerscheZahl
 dbdr: might have been reworded; I doubt the behaviour has changed 
 Westicles: First, 25 paragraphs on why using namespace std is  bad.  Then close for off topic
 reCurse: Well it's been reworded to the point where absolutely nothing says what it used to say
 dbdr: Torvalds is fanatic in presenting user-mode compatibility
 miszu: could you simply do trial and error?
 reCurse: It seems to work now
 JBM: *preserving
 reCurse: And I hate "seeming to work"
 dbdr: thanks
 miszu: use the word: high confidence
 reCurse: Let alone the ridiculous fact SIGALRM terminates your process by default
 reCurse: But installing an empty handler has consequences I can't predict
 AntiSquid: i hate reddit for the BS vote system, but their tech subreddits occasionally give great answers
 miszu: that's very low level you do
 AntiSquid: so reddit &gt; SO for asking it yourself unfortunately .
 reCurse: Hmm
 eulerscheZahl: i never asked myself on SO. but for looking things up it's a great source

 AntiSquid: oh i remember i missed t-shirt range twice through unstable ranking submit ... 
 eulerscheZahl: and your mediocre bot
 AntiSquid: regardless, was in range lol
 AntiSquid: i think some default bots were in range :thinking: 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 submit default and hope for shirt
 Automaton2000: with all the test cases?
 dbf: on some mini-raic there was a default improved bot created by one of participants and shared as an example, and it was a t-shirt level
 eulerscheZahl: i only played the paper.io mini RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: missed top6 on a coinflip
 eulerscheZahl: was 6th before the very last battle&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that would have been a smartwatch
 ItsNotABug: sorry for the maybe silly comment, but whats this RAIC stuff?
 eulerscheZahl: russian AI cup
 AntiSquid: royal air institute championship
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mailru/blog/530232/">https://habr.com/ru/company/mailru/blog/530232/</a>there's a view preview
 ItsNotABug: Ah, so its not the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada

 AntiSquid: why do they show a gif of codecraft on the blog&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: because it goes slightly in the same direction
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't think that it's an advantage if you played codecraft
 eulerscheZahl: C#, C++, D, F#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Rust и Scala.
 eulerscheZahl: they have D
 AntiSquid: :O
 AntiSquid: ok .
 eulerscheZahl: someone just shared a weird replay on the forum <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/511388061">https://www.codingame.com/replay/511388061</a>
 eulerscheZahl: frame 3, where does that blue come from? and why does only 1 player get it?
 AntiSquid: boss cheating .
 blasterpoard: it's viewer that's wrong
 kovi: visual glitch, but someone paid on turn2
 blasterpoard: 1/0/1/0 had 1 tax
 eulerscheZahl: ah, right
 struct: this blender stuff is not simple
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what blasterpoard said, I noticed this too... the effective result is correct.  However, when simultaneous taxes are paid ... the red player gets the benefit and blue doesn't get the currently added benefit from red.  i don't think it's truly simultaneous
 AntiSquid: i told you it's not struct 
 AntiSquid: have a go at unreal engine too 
 AntiSquid: blender takes a while to get used to
 struct: I dont think ue4 can save as gITF, three js recomends it
 AntiSquid: but you can transform 2d images into 3D objects there's some tut somewhere for that
 AntiSquid: (in blender)

 struct: ill check it thanks
 struct: i know its 9x9 its supposed to be for shogi
 struct: just wanted to play a bit with it 
 AntiSquid: 3D chess items shouldn't be too hard btw, just look up how to do a glass tutorial as example then you can see how you can do the pieces ... shogi pieces are simple
 eulerscheZahl: you can also find lots of 3D models online
 eulerscheZahl: once I found a planet express ship
 AntiSquid: but where's the torment and the suffering in that?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: yes i was following a tutorial for chess
 struct: he does the board + pieces in 10 minutes
 struct: in real time
 eulerscheZahl: i have colleagues working as CAD designers. they are really fast.
 eulerscheZahl: i know how to design a cube. for a sphere I need a working internet connection :D

 struct: I might not even need to learn blender at all
 struct: thanks AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: the classic Blender tutorial
 eulerscheZahl: throwing hotkeys at you
 struct: yeah and the version im at doesnt really help
 struct: some stuff is in another place
 struct: different icons
 jacek: 3d chess?
 jacek: as in graphics or several board chess
 struct: jacek i wanted to port shogi
 struct: and wanted to do 3d graphics
 struct: to try it
 miszu: why competitions are so far apart?
 miszu: like next one is in May or something?
 dbf: because they need resources to design and implement a new game
 AntiSquid: and they also want to do something else&#160;! :P
 AntiSquid: like quest map / language upgrades / private contests ...
 jacek: and people cant afford to allnighters every week
 Drakkhonian: HOLY COW
 Drakkhonian: and after 2 months of trying this on my off time at work

 MadKnight: RAIC starts in 10min guys
 MadKnight: let's go
 AntiSquid: for real&#160;?
 AntiSquid: the beta?
 MadKnight: beta
 MadKnight: they already told what's the game
 AntiSquid: everyone types russian on discord Q_Q<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/YgGzAKP_HuM?t=231">https://youtu.be/YgGzAKP_HuM?t=231</a>
 MadKnight: wat
 miszu: cyka blyat
 AntiSquid: ^
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 say something in russian
 Automaton2000: and i got no idea
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 fix it
 Automaton2000: yeah that would be very hard to tell if a sample is diagnosed or not?
 miszu: Rush B Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: especially if you have two ways to get a t-shirt

 MadKnight: nice pic AntiSquid
 miszu: I wrote 25 unit tests for my UTTT and still not done testing everything
 AntiSquid: what's that link MadKnight&#160;?
 AntiSquid: imgur blocked in russia or what?
 jacek: why would anyone ever write unit tests :v
 Guinsoo: Wait A child's play is impossible 
 miszu: jacek lol
 miszu: I call it a pro move
 AntiSquid: how about writing unit tests to check grammar and spelling in the comments&#160;?
 ItsNotABug: well now i've got to have a go at a childs play :P
 miszu: c++ optimizer, I need your advice on this function. Does it look okay?
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6fa190b-e90d-44ab-9567-9df3d8821d4d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6fa190b-e90d-44ab-9567-9df3d8821d4d</a>
 Uljahn: there is an option to make LUTs for sqrt(log()) and inv_sqrt(), but has to be profiled
 miszu: thanks. So it shouldn't really be a bottleneck
 Astrobytes: It can be, but you need to profile to check
 Astrobytes: sorry I didn't answer your PM miszu, been busy
 tomatoes: optimize rollouts first
 PatrickMcGinnisII: log(totalVisit)*2 is better imho inside the sqrt... and you can get rid of the floats altogether with proper scaling, but i digress
 therealbeef: miszu does like his consts&#160;;-)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: even left shifting the nodecount before typecasting, but the log should force a typecast anyway
 MadKnight: no it's not AntiSquid
 MadKnight: okay now it loaded
 ItsNotABug: Took a minute to deal with the edge cases, but done a childs play :D 
 miszu: therealbeef haha. If you can make them const why not? :P
 therealbeef: i think it's a good habit and it won't hurt
 miszu: but yeah PatrickMcGinnisII. I can put the 2 inside of the sqrt
 miszu: so I avoid that floating multiplication
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is returning by const when val is only calculated once really do anything?
 therealbeef: but im not sure if they are useful on by-value arguments and return values
 Astrobytes: const correctness is kinda all-in, you can mix and match a little but you'll end up in trouble&#160;:)
 miszu: const to a primitive doesn't really do anything
 miszu: Astrobytes by unit testing my engine, I found 3 bugs
 Uljahn: also don't forget about exploration coefficient
 miszu: so now I have high confidence of the correctness of my board
 Astrobytes: Excellent! What were they miszu?
 miszu: Uljahn the coefficient is the 2
 Astrobytes: +1 for Uljahn's comment
 miszu: sqrt(2)
 Uljahn: :upside_down:
 miszu: Astrobytes 2 were the same mistake but in each of their own method. Basically when I win a small board, I put the win bit on a different board...
 Astrobytes: lol, definitely not optimal&#160;:)
 miszu: the 3rd one I found recently was when you can play anywhere you want, I only gave a local board to play
 miszu: not the whole board
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can bitshift &lt;&lt;1 the fastint in the divisor, but as long as you don't put in extra () parenthesis the compiler ... oh nevermind...
 miszu: why bitshifting?
 miszu: you lost my with bitshifting here
 miszu: me*
 Uljahn: the same as *2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: float*2/fastint is fine
 miszu: okay then
 miszu: I really changed my mcts so  Idon't use vecotrs
 miszu: and don't create any extra objects
 miszu: once I test a bit my MCTS, my sims goes brr
 miszu: thanks all
 miszu: this is my struct for node

 Uljahn: parents can be tracked in a separate array
 Astrobytes: ^  so you just need an int to track its index
 AntiSquid: are you playing RAIC halite Uljahn&#160;?
 Uljahn: AntiSquid: no, im back to 2048
 Astrobytes: StarLite/HalCraft
 Uljahn: i don't like RAIC
 Astrobytes: (defo Halite)
 Uljahn: that too
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 when Automaton2048&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i had to google it
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: How is it? I've been busy so not checked it properly yet
 ItsNotABug: Why are all the upvoted solutions for a childs play ones that dont even pass the test scenarios?
 ItsNotABug: smh
 Astrobytes: Perhaps the testcases were changed at some point ItsNotABug
 MadKnight: probably because they changed the test cases
 Astrobytes: MadKnight&#160;;)
 MadKnight: they need to mark old solutions
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I don't think they will tho'.
 Astrobytes: Will you play RAIC MadKnight?
 MadKnight: will see
 Astrobytes: same
 ItsNotABug: ah. so their original test cases just didn't include all the test cases. shame they've kept the solutions for people who solve it after
 AntiSquid: there is no versus implemented yet on the site, you need to train locally Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: well it's just halite but more complicated
 AntiSquid: with shooting ships 
 Astrobytes: if you look at solutions that have a later date ItsNotABug they might be more relevant
 AntiSquid: and you can kill your own 
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: yeah, was just wondering about the API etc
 Astrobytes: I suppose round 2 will be where it goes nuts with the FOW
 Astrobytes: *what with the FOW
 AntiSquid: update my avatar just in case i change my mind ... it's a fake exorcist who throws salt to scare ghosts, which doesn't work, but charges people regardless <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/profile/AntiSquid">https://russianaicup.ru/profile/AntiSquid</a>
 miszu: thanks all
 Astrobytes: working better miszu?
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: what about the api Astrobytes&#160;? you get the start bot, add your strategy and can run it locally if you have the game environment downloaded and running 
 Snc: hi
 AntiSquid: i think you can upload zip too, but you're not meant to edit the API interaction
 Astrobytes: sorry, just read the rules
 struct: this blender stuff
 struct: I want to make an irregular pentagon
 struct: cant find how
 miszu: Astrobytes I haven't run in the ide
 miszu: I am writing tests in visual studio
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 miszu: making sure there is no bug
 Astrobytes: wise&#160;;)
 miszu: if I don't get legendary this time... I will be disapointed
 AntiSquid: you could draw lines i believe to create a surface and then if you want to make it 3D use extrude struct
 Astrobytes: Failures are lessons required for victory, don't worry about it miszu
 miszu: :P
 Astrobytes: it's true :D
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I am massively tired, see you all tomorrow
 miszu: my failure was hidden bugs in my engine
 miszu: now I strongly believe it will work
 miszu: good night!
 struct: gn
 AntiSquid: gn8
 Astrobytes: gl miszu!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mesh a circle with a given step?
 AntiSquid: when you import an image btw you can select the outline of an object on the image and extrude that into a 3D object too 
 struct: really?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: hm don't have it on this pc, but have some funny looking models from that
 MadKnight: have u guys started RAIC already&#160;?
 ItsNotABug: jesus. I've download the pack for RAIC and dont have a clue what to do with it lol
 MadKnight: check the Quick start
 ItsNotABug: I have, not finding it very clear lol
 therealbeef: Promotion to Gold League in&#160;:00H 45MN 26SC, seriously? -_-
 ItsNotABug: ouch. That for fall?
 therealbeef: uttt

 struct: yes, its from board game shogi
 MadKnight: u gonna play RAIC with us&#160;?
 Zenoscave: do goroutines work with CG?
 struct: Im not sure ill play RAIC
 MadKnight: it's kind of like warcraft
 MadKnight: and they're giving starter bot
 MadKnight: Zenoscave what are goroutines?
 Zenoscave: golang lightwaeight concurrency
 Zenoscave: They should work on single core computers 
 Bikoko: whats wrong with our server?
 MadKnight: what's our server&#160;?
 MadKnight: Zenoscave i think we got one hyperthreading core so that makes it 2 threads on 1 core
 Bikoko: it goes slowly
 MadKnight: where
 Bikoko: in cant test my code in clash
 struct: site seems very slow yeah
 ItsNotABug: Yeah, im trying to just run my code in ide, and its slow as heck
 Y0ursTruly: oof my lag
 Y0ursTruly: can't even click submit
 Bikoko: not oly me feel like that?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 do u feel like it&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i'm not that good in the end i think
 Y0ursTruly: oh 2 minutes later it finally subits
 ItsNotABug: this is painful. Woulda thought after fall ending servers would be happy
 MadKnight: oh is it back to normal again&#160;?
 catalactics: what happened to the servers?
 catalactics: my testcases won't even run lol
 ItsNotABug: Has anyone got a way to stop the page and discord on the right reloading every 5 seconds, and moving my cursor into the discord chat on an old convo that i dont even want open
 Raynor1994: So uh, how do I start the ASCII art?
 Raynor1994: I'm trying todo it in JS
 TimberStalker: I belive you asign certain ascii characters to a value between 0 and 1(based on how much space the character takes up on screen) and then use the grayscale to select characters.
 TimberStalker: just realised the comment im responding to was 30 minutes ago
 TimberStalker: oh well.
 TimberStalker: just ignore everything i said
 Raynor1994: i skipped it for now
 Raynor1994: what lang did u use?
 TimberStalker: I just assumed you were doing normal ascii art
 TimberStalker: i think the coding challenge wants something different
 TimberStalker: im doing it in c# right now though. Converting to JS isnt that hard

 Roma_Shteyninger: Hi guys, tell me where to see what problems I have solved?
 Crypticsy: Hey! could you guys review my contribution? It's always one short from being approved
 Nanosplitter: Crypticsy I’ll take a look
 om_margaj: hi
 Rival819: im taking a free C# class on Codecademy.....then coming back here hehe will understand a lot better its already awespme what I have achieved learning 
 Rival819: im bronze 33 in CSB
 Rival819: from no knowlede
 Rival819: knowledge, so now will be back in force
 Rival819: hehe
 Rival819: im learning concatenations and interpolations of text atm
 Rival819:&#160;:)
 Rival819: well almost done that part actually
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid... I suddenly am really tempted to re-implement my code in c++ to see if it goes faster
 orangesnowfox: But I'm *tired* right now, so I have to convince myself I really don't want to
 DragonNinjaA: what are puts
 GilbertGaming27: Gilbet
 ANONYMOUS42: i would like to join your cult
 evaporatetranslator: hi
 ANONYMOUS42: hi
 Nuggs: GIBLERT
 davilla: man I can tell when these puzzles are going to take a while, why do I still dive in?
 davilla: difficulty level doesn't correspond to how much work, necessarily
 derjack: depends what you know now
 derjack: graphs-related stuff has more difficulty yet its easier for me than i.e. string manipulations
 davilla: well do you know how to rotate a rubix cube?
 derjack: probably not oO
 davilla: not solve, just turn one of the sides
 davilla: total nightmare
 derjack: depends how inputs outputs are organized
 davilla: well there was a trick to it, and everyone else's solution was really cheesy
 davilla: now I'm doing the harder rubix
 AmineEmi: hello every one
 derjack: good morning
 DaNinja: ohayo
 Rakotoo: I m stuck at Mars Lander 2, could you help me?
 AntiSquid: kumbawa DaNinja
 DaNinja: kombucha Squid-san
 AntiSquid: oh it's konbanwa 
 AntiSquid: or are both correct? i don't know anymore
 PhantomMaster_8f0b: wesh la team
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: Good morning everyone
 Shrimpster: Good morning to you too
 WOLFRAHH: But here is afternoon
 Shrimpster: Well its for your next morning then&#160;;)
 WOLFRAHH: :grinning:
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhh it is the afternoon in my country too, but since i just woke up like an hour ago.. good morning felt like the right answer :sweat_smile:
 derjack: oO
 WOLFRAHH: oO
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: oO&#160;?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: Guys and Girls, any chance someone could explain to me the puzzle of the week? i don't even understand the logic behind the 2or5 =&gt; 3 :sweat_smile:
 derjack: puzzle of the week?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yap this one&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/nuggets-numbers">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/nuggets-numbers</a>
 derjack: well they cant serve 3, because its 2, 2+2, 5, 5+2, 5+2+2 etc.
 MACKEYTH: They can sell you any number of boxes 2 nuggets or 5 nuggets in any combination
 MACKEYTH: But you can never buy exactly 3 nuggets using those amounts
 MACKEYTH: You could buy 2 boxes of two, then eat a nugget, I suppose.  ;)
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: so that would mean the min is 4 and the max infinity
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: and the answer is min -1
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI:&#160;?
 ANONYMOUS42: not really
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: can you elaborate&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: You can combine positive multiples of 2 and 5 to create any number except 1 or 3
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yap
 MACKEYTH: The highest number you can't make is 3,that's the answer
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: ok
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i get that so far, thank you for your help everyone
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i will try my best to get the rest on my own
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: a+
 jacek: sounds like coin change problem
 LeonardoBorges: sounds like great common divisor :P
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: sounds like hell

 el1oz: thank you very much guys.&#160;!!!
 WOLFRAHH: or you can solve easy puzzles
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: clashes are not for beginners
 el1oz: ar thesee puzzles in these links above?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: clashes are hell
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yes sir
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: or ma'am
 WOLFRAHH: you can't say clashes are hell
 N-ONE: i think clashes are easier than practice problem 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: dude they are
 [CG]Thibaud: the timer can be stressful if you just want to take your time solving a simple puzzle
 el1oz: sir! :D thank you guys, nice to have such good community
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: you are much welcome
 el1oz: yes indeed. timer is stressful

 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: my first clash broke me to the point of leaving the codingame platfome for months
 jacek: oh my
 ANONYMOUS42: maybe start with easier ones lol
 N-ONE: is this the prime factorization problem&#160;?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: thank you @MACKEYTH
 el1oz: haha, same here. i started 3 months ago with c++ and i can't even do one clash :D 
 el1oz: i am very new to programming world :D
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: take it slow
 jacek: c++ for clash? youre bringing knife to gun fight
 el1oz: i am inlove with c++ and its only language i can understand for now. 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: what would you use jacek
 WOLFRAHH: yeah for clashes ruby or python is good
 [CG]Thibaud: JS too
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: js is life
 AntiSquid: :D
 AntiSquid: i agree
 WOLFRAHH: anyways jacek can you play clash with me
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: el1oz try javascript
 el1oz: is it good to know pythin with c++? 
 el1oz: i will try
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: @WOLFRAHH you have a death wish
 el1oz: what is good JS for?
 Hri7566: is array.prototype.forEach too slow?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: everything 
 el1oz: is it more powerful than c++?
 WOLFRAHH: yeah js is good i used python ruby  or js to solve task to solve clashes in 3 language

 WOLFRAHH: yeah or bye Yassine_EL_HOSNI
 el1oz: by
 el1oz: bye sir
 jacek: c++ is fast; python is easy to write
 WOLFRAHH: jacek is correct 
 el1oz: thank you @jacek 
 el1oz: oh one more question, is CodinGame totally free? or does it has subscription or smth?
 AntiSquid: VIP feature allows you to ping AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: food was a position of the graphics
 el1oz: @AntiSquid what is AutomatoNN?
 WOLFRAHH: it is a chatbot
 WOLFRAHH: el1oz
 Mogeek1: I'm new hear can someone help me to become proficient
 AntiSquid: el1oz type first few letters of a name and then press tab to complete the name, AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: error you can use it for the problem that the map is fine

 kovi: i improved my mcts few weeks agobut yeah jacek pushed me
 2kpro: does anybody have a chicken nugget
 2kpro: hello does anybody have a chicken nugget 
 AntiSquid: weird question to ask, and twice, do you want it with MSM meat&#160;?
 2kpro: what do you mean by msm
 2kpro: i'll eat anything right now
 2kpro: but not penuts
 ill-be-waiting-outside: me to
 ill-be-waiting-outside: i can't eat any types of nuts
 2kpro: im elergic to penuts so i cant eat penuts
 ill-be-waiting-outside: yea me too
 2kpro: i wished i new what penuts tasted like
 2kpro: but im elergic
 2kpro: to then
 jacek: it's peanut butter jelly time!
 ill-be-waiting-outside: really:sweat_smile:
 2kpro: :joy:
 ill-be-waiting-outside: lol thats mean
 AntiSquid: med mi rough
 2kpro: hgvvgv
 GilbertGaming27: Gilbert
 ill-be-waiting-outside: is that all u say
 jacek: dilbert?
 ill-be-waiting-outside: not u
 2kpro: is that all you say gilbert is gilbert
 AntiSquid: maybe it's a timmeh reference&#160;?
 ill-be-waiting-outside: geez
 2kpro: im eating me some ramen and im not like jonny 7 :ramen:
 Hannnn: sup guys

 Hannnn: you have three dog??
 2kpro: i have 15 dogs
 Hannnn: shush 
 ill-be-waiting-outside: yea
 2kpro: why
 ill-be-waiting-outside: its not that bad
 2kpro: i just have 15 dogs is that a bad thing
 Hannnn: must be very fulfilling to have 
 ill-be-waiting-outside: cuz one is mine one is my dad and the last one is my mom
 Hannnn: 15 dogs for real?
 GilbertGaming27: Gilbert
 2kpro: yup  i got 15 dogs
 ill-be-waiting-outside: why
 2kpro: because i like dogs
 ill-be-waiting-outside: oh
 2kpro: and plus i tought them to do back flip
 ill-be-waiting-outside: wow really

 2kpro: i mean i also rap
 ill-be-waiting-outside: me to
 2kpro: ay get your crop of my mop or ill feed you slop
 2kpro: or ill trow out the pop
 ill-be-waiting-outside: oh
 2kpro: because i dont care 
 2kpro: if you stare
 2kpro: at a bear
 ill-be-waiting-outside: scared u mean
 2kpro: im raping
 ill-be-waiting-outside: oh
 ill-be-waiting-outside: ok
 2kpro: and slaping
 2kpro: you get it
 2kpro: raping and slaping
 2kpro: :man_dancing:
 2kpro: im on a roll with the fold
 2kpro: and i hold
 2kpro: 24 i go in the door
 2kpro: 54
 2kpro: 74 
 2kpro: im the door
 2kpro: im done raping everybody
 AntiSquid: too much spam, jokes too "eccentric" and require very particular taste, not suitable for this community @_@
 AntiSquid: maybe you didn't lose your email? maybe you got banned? 2kpro
 jacek: how can one 'lose' email
 AntiSquid: by making a single use throw away email
 jacek: like 10 minutes mail?
 AntiSquid: register spam once and be done with it
 GilbertGaming27: there should be protection against those emails
 GilbertGaming27: a whitelist, of sorts
 2kpro: um
 2kpro: im sorry
 AntiSquid: increase quality of jokes/trolling or abstain from chat 
 2kpro: im sorry
 Uljahn: expecting quality from lvl3 user :relieved:
 Rival819: this website really pushed me where I needed to be 
 AntiSquid: we have high standards here Uljahn
 Rival819: forced me to go take a 30 hours C# class on Codecademy
 Rival819: took me 3 days
 Rival819: of sleeping and looking at screen
 Rival819: but I learned a damn lot
 Rival819: finally done with it
 Rival819: now time to go make more exp :D
 2kpro: im going to take classes to get better at coding
 Rival819: do it its worth
 2kpro: thanks
 Rival819: I did this one
 Rival819: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/c-sharp">https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/c-sharp</a>
 Rival819: if you are pro subscriber you can even make them Certificates
 Rival819: but the class lessons are free
 jacek: c# eh
 Rival819: so I finished with no cert but can go back to them anytime
 Rival819: yeh I did not have any language except from recognising them...
 Rival819: so I learned C# straight aways
 Rival819: still have practice to do anyway
 Rival819: at least now I can correct and understand everything in it
 Rival819:&#160;:)
 Rival819: because seriously shit his hard when you start wit nothing
 Rival819: here
 Rival819: even class gets kinda rough near the end but they are stuff you will not always use or will learn in practice after learning them
 Rival819: but the basics gets stronger
 Rival819: :P
 Rival819: you see differently ... slowly
 orangesnowfox: jacek, better than Java at least
 orangesnowfox: (but worse than Kotlin I think)
 jacek: so, have you solved any puzzle after the class
 jacek: or made multiplayer bot
 Rival819: was already bronze in the CSB game, and tought I was understanding and that my code was good, but now I know it was nothing else then a good if loop
 Rival819: that his the difference
 Rival819: I did not try anything yet
 Rival819: I just finished
 Rival819: smoking a big one to celebrate then doing puzzles :P
 Rival819: got 2 puzzle done
 Rival819: or 3
 Rival819: ut now I will know what im doing
 Rival819: but *
 jacek: :tada:
 Rival819: my eyes are itchy though :alien:
 jacek: why do java developers wear glasses? because they can't C#
 jacek: :drum:
 Rival819: Note to self:string 30HourClass = ($" This class takes 3 days of suffering if you grind {self}");
 Rival819: jacek :joy:
 orangesnowfox: Rival819&gt; " This class takes 3 days of suffering if you grind Rival819"
 Rival819: hahahaha
 Rival819: indeed xD

 kresteodymium: hi
 kresteodymium: are all of you in college
 AlfaisalJauhari: Anyone here play code of clash of code?
 Unicorn123321: me
 AlfaisalJauhari: k, do you usually share your code after u're done?
 Unicorn123321: yes...
 AlfaisalJauhari: nice
 Unicorn123321: but the only highest score I have gotten is 55%
 AlfaisalJauhari: i'm curious as to y some don't, wanted someone's perspective
 AlfaisalJauhari: that's fine, there's always someone to learn from and always someone that can learn from u
 Unicorn123321: :blush:

 MarTiaNe: Hey, I can't use numpy in python&#160;? Or I have to install it 
 wlesavo: you can just import numpy
 MarTiaNe: It raises an error 
 jacek: you mean on CG or locally
 MarTiaNe: CG ofcourse
 jacek: what error
 BlaiseEbuth: "Don't use python error"
 wlesavo: just tried numpy code, worked ok
 dbdr: PEBKAC error
 MarTiaNe: In COC games 
 wlesavo: a lot of 999 is gonna come to NS huh
 2kpro: what?
 jacek: did he make the post mortem
 MarTiaNe: I used it several times and it did not recognize that library
 wlesavo: but an interesting read from marchete nevertheless
 dbdr: gg Marchete
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-number-shifting/152425/49">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-number-shifting/152425/49</a>
 Marchete: I use CG to learn from others
 Marchete: and NS isn't even a challenge or multi or anything
 wlesavo: yeah, i still feel there is more good than bad from sharing 
 Marchete: I feel good from sharing
 Marchete: not a direct C&amp;P
 Marchete: all the setup is hard
 Marchete: not like Ctrl+C on github Ctrl+V on CG IDE
 2kpro: has anybody played csr2
 dbdr: a bit of a climate crime to publish it when warm days are coming though&#160;;)
 Westicles: hmmm
 wlesavo: green police
 kovi: nice jacek
 2kpro: :basketball: oh man i missed it
 jacek: :soccer:?
 2kpro: no not soccer
 Westicles: "The code is INTENTIONALLY broken, it won't compile right out of the box. You need to fix the marked TODO's, if you know some C++ it can be done in less than 5 minutes"
 Westicles: 5 minutes isn't much of a barrier
 jacek: oh my
 kovi: lol dbdrmaybe we should share results as well...just to save the planet!
 2kpro: i wished i new c++ but im doing c#
 Unicorn123321: hm.
 Unicorn123321: bye
 dbdr: kovi :D
 alerinty: guys, i am noob with c++, but how can i debug my code?
 jacek: on CG use cerr to print things
 MSmits: jacek, I C# but sill need glasses&#160;:(
 MSmits: still
 jacek: do you? you dont even use generics
 MSmits: you're saying generics will fix it?
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: thanks will try
 Westicles: lol.  there is only one TODO, and it is writing the output to a file
 Marchete: are you mad about the sharing?
 Marchete: I'm replying it
 Marchete: but I don't see the problem
 Westicles: Not mad... I just thought CG worked hard to keep solutions off github.  Seems weird to deliberately do so
 Marchete: as I say on my post
 Marchete: I shared a LAHC solver 1 year ago
 Marchete: that reached 330
 Marchete: I haven't see a massive amount of players going lvl200+
 Marchete: maybe xevi xevi
 MSmits: I have 2 opinions about this 
 Marchete: also my old solvers were more a cryptominer than a solver
 Marchete: like 70 vCPUs for 20 hours for a damn level 600+
 MSmits: 1) I do consider it spoiling so that's not good
 MSmits: but 2) I can learn from this
 MSmits: and apply it to other things
 MSmits: and that does make me happy
 Marchete: I choose 2)
 Westicles: Well, for example I might have made a run at 999 but won't now.  Can't speak for others
 Unicorn123321: i! 
 Marchete: I hate those papers that give a lot of mumbling
 jacek: i dont mind. maybe it could more of pseudo code, but its alright
 Marchete: but not real support
 Marchete: they claim something that can't be checked
 jacek:&#160;!
 jacek: like mcts solver paper?
 MSmits: papers with mumbling?
 Marchete: like a lot of papers
 MSmits: you mean no details?
 Unicorn123321: !eyb
 Marchete: they claim a lot of good things
 Marchete: but there is no way to disprove it
 MSmits: the D&amp;B papers have tons of details, but they are mostly math papers
 jacek: maybe you read the bible
 Marchete: anyways test to recreate my code
 Westicles: At least if you publish a bot contest CG can ban accounts that submit it, but offline there isn't an option
 Marchete: maybe it's not that easy
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: guys what are you talking about hhhh
 MSmits: so Marchete when are you going to improve your solver to use gpu
 Marchete: CG stated that sharing was OK, except on challenges
 Marchete: I thought about it
 Marchete: but in the end I don't needed it
 ReaListik: code conflict is very difficult&#160;: '(
 hyphz: Wow, nuggets is hard&#160;:(
 Marchete: I was happy that with a single CPU + tons of luck I can solve a lvl1000 in under 6 minutes
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: lvl1k of what hhhh
 Marchete: and I never coded for GPU, I need to learn eventually
 MSmits: i was kidding, but sure
 jacek: so the number shifting became easier
 jacek: its number capslocking now
 MSmits: but jeez Marchete the times on your solver are insane
 MSmits: If machine learning wasnt next on my list, I would be studying your code instead
 Westicles: I guess just in the future consider that just because you are finished with a problem, others might still be interested in it so try not to spoil
 Marchete: they are real, I restested lvls 200-600 while I was writting the postmortem
 MSmits: yeah, you can probably run all 1000 levels in a few days
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: It took like 40+ days for me
 MSmits: I needed days just to get one of the early 200 levels done
 AntiSquid: you have your postmortem ready&#160;?
 AntiSquid: :O
 MSmits: this is why the quality of an algorithm is so much more important than the language it is coded in
 Westicles: AntiSquid, he published the code
 MSmits: if you did this in python, you would still beat any of our c++ implementations
 Marchete: domain knowledge can boost anything a LOT
 Marchete: like LAHC alone with bad mutators was sh*t
 Marchete: ending on local maximums really fast
 Marchete: slow convergence at starting, etc..
 MSmits: by mutator you just mean a way to change a solution right? Like changing the order between two cities in a TSP
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: yeah that seems pretty important
 Marchete: something clever instead of random points
 MSmits: right
 Marchete: esp. on ending moves, permutations and merges
 Unicorn123321: ok bye
 MSmits: that's as important with good heuristics on a random mcts rollout 
 Marchete: but this is very specific to NS
 MSmits: like not suiciding with a random yavalath move
 MSmits: i will study it for sure
 MSmits: not to get some easy cp for NS, but to see if i can use it for other games
 MSmits: even if it is NS specific
 MSmits: it has some generic traits too doesnt it?
 MSmits: ways of approaching a problem like this
 jacek: not suiciding is like decisive/anti decisive move in hex in other games, general enough
 Marchete: it was about endgame accepting much worse moves
 Marchete: based on remaining numbers
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: if I'm at 1 number left I can go to 3 numbers left
 Marchete: no matter what
 MSmits: how do you mean?
 Marchete: as long as 3 gives "diversity"
 Marchete: it's in the PM
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: just accepting worse moves on endgame
 Marchete: without taking score into account
 MSmits: do people still have to work through all the levels?
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: ok good, less of a spoil then. At least it takes some work
 Marchete: and on lvl932 the exporter fails
 Marchete: it doesn't fit on stderr
 MSmits: exporter?
 Marchete: so you need to compress it, base64 etc etc
 Marchete: extract level data from CG
 MSmits: lol
 Marchete: it doesn't fit on a single stderr frame
 MSmits: nice
 Marchete: took me 4hrs to notice...
 jacek: like 2048, too many moves and it doesnt work
 MSmits: never did 2048
 MSmits: i dont do all the optims. I am just glad i solved bender 4
 AntiSquid: is the top in 2048 trained offline? 
 MSmits: and my student did as well&#160;:)
 MSmits: i just gave him a hint and he coded it himself, in js
 Marchete: I need to learn about machine learning
 jacek: hows MLP?
 Marchete: seems that you are into that right now
 AntiSquid: i beat mcsmitz at bender @_@ yay
 MSmits: havent worked on it since i translated the xor to c++. But I know exactly what to do thanks to you jacek. Just need to find the time
 MSmits: AntiSquid good job&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: no table flips? euler gave me table flips
 jacek: translation xor to c++: 1 xor 2 -&gt; 1 ^ 2 [solved]
 MSmits: AntiSquid I like to be beaten, gives me motivation. 
 MSmits: that came out wrong
 AntiSquid: no, stay put, i want to keep my CP thanks :P
 jacek: that also came out wrong
 AntiSquid: your rank is a lucky number i am sure
 MSmits: jacek, next i want to generalize the xor example to set up an arbitrary amount of layers with different size layers and use more inputs 
 MSmits: and I had a question. Can I instead of prediction loss/draw/win predict net seed gain in oware? 
 MSmits: as a single output number
 Marchete: I remember I had some NN done in C++
 Marchete: need to recheck
 jacek: sure, why not
 AntiSquid: i wonder if you'll eventually try kaggle MSmits, you can use ML libraries for python
 jacek: though you probably want to scale it to 0..1
 MSmits: it seems to fit well with my endgame db
 MSmits: yeah the scaling
 MSmits: I will need to do that
 MSmits: i plan to train the bot in the 48-10 seed region and ignore endgame
 MSmits: that could make it more efficient
 MSmits: or not, no idea
 jacek: i never trained for something other than win/loss though
 MSmits: yeah, i have no idea if it'll work
 MSmits: but if you do it based on net seed gain, you can ignore score
 MSmits: so thats 2 less inputs
 MSmits: just the 12 pits then
 MSmits: combined with the loss of endgame training, it might make it better
 MSmits: or easier to train, either way is good
 jacek: so you have some board and the predicted output is 3. what would you do with that?
 MSmits: you mean for training?
 jacek: in game tree
 MSmits: for gameplay i would just pick the move with the highest net seed gain
 jacek: ahh
 jacek: makes sense
 vdick: hi
 MSmits: for training it can be done the same way as you're doing with L/DW
 MSmits: except i need to worry about scaling
 MSmits: it's not a trivial problem because technically you can go up to +48 seeds
 MSmits: but most net gains will be +1 to +8 or so
 Marchete: I prefer to train on real ML frameworks
 MSmits: what do you mean by real Marchete?
 MSmits: do you mean existing?
 MSmits: like tensorflow?
 Marchete: tensorflow and similar, yes
 Marchete: then export weights
 jacek: you cant use those on CG&#160;:&lt;
 MSmits: were you able to do this Marchete?
 MSmits: because if that were easy, i might do that too
 jacek: but first you need write code to undestand those weights
 MSmits: thats true
 AntiSquid: others did it too, they wrote in chat about it
 MSmits: really? Is that what re curse does?
 AntiSquid: there's a function export weights
 MSmits: and robo?
 AntiSquid: you export weights and then for CG jsut code the forward prop
 jacek: of course you can
 MSmits: just coding the forward prop can get complicated with convolution I think?
 MSmits: if you just do mlp it's eays
 Marchete: I did it yes
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: at least on basic examples
 Marchete: that test on tensorflow
 Marchete: it gave the same output values
 MSmits: maybe i should try that then. I really dislike the crap with all the python package versions though
 Marchete: but just basic tensors
 MSmits: thats really offputting
 Marchete: why?
 Marchete: and with AVX of course
 MSmits: it took me hours to get some examples running and most i never got working
 Marchete: convolution was hard
 MSmits: stuff people shared
 Marchete: I never achieved it
 Marchete: basic tensors were as fast as tensorflow
 Marchete: I'd recheck and share it
 Marchete: it was nice
 Marchete: and in C++
 MSmits: if you want to share that would be awesome
 MSmits: would make me happier than your NS wrecker
 MSmits: (currently)
 MSmits: My connect4 meta mcts has been going nuts lately, doing 10 games per second
 Marchete: I need time
 Marchete: it was just basic learning
 Marchete: not alphazero 
 Marchete: yet
 MSmits: well that's further along than I am
 jacek: and what does it say now
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a683b43a-4a4c-4ad6-9ebd-48e5d70931b5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a683b43a-4a4c-4ad6-9ebd-48e5d70931b5</a>
 jacek: hmm i found something. i think they also use score for othello, not only winrate or policy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3278312.3278325">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3278312.3278325</a>
 MSmits: i focused it on move 1 because i wanted to know if it's a draw or not
 MSmits: i still dont know if it is
 MSmits: but it's going very very fast
 jacek: oh and here i think they use mcts solver for a0 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3293475.3293486">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3293475.3293486</a> how come a0 and the like don't already use the solver&#160;:?
 jacek: very fast? that means close to the end
 MSmits: well yes it is definitely very close to the end, but the number of endgame leafs is very large
 ZarthaxX: MSmits learning ML for your studies or because you want to apply it on cg?
 MSmits: so it might still take millions
 AntiSquid: i swear i don't find the time to read everything linked in chat
 ZarthaxX: who knows how they do
 MSmits: ZarthaxX personal interest, applying on CG and to a far lesser degree, knowing what i am talking about during teaching
 ZarthaxX: so mainly cg heh
 ZarthaxX: good luck&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, the thing is, i've kind of hit the limit of what i can do with meta mcts and regular bots for boardgames
 MSmits: i mean i can cheese my way to nr 1 in most games without NN, but i dont want to
 ZarthaxX: this will open many more options
 MSmits: yes
 ZarthaxX: i would love to learn that too but other things in the way that are also interesting
 ZarthaxX: i guess once you finish uni and have a stable work you can do what you do hehe
 MSmits: yeah always so many interesting things. Better have too many than none at all, i guess
 ZarthaxX: btw, a friend that is obsessed with ML told me about this course, maybe it helps<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/">https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/</a>
 MSmits: well thats exactly what i am at now, i need to finish my studies so i can do more ML&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: videos are on youtube<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgzM3zpZ55o&amp;list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgzM3zpZ55o&amp;list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u</a>
 AntiSquid: you can find some of the ML algos rewritten without a library here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58v9cLitc8VaCjrcKyAbrw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58v9cLitc8VaCjrcKyAbrw</a> mcsmitz 
 ZarthaxX: of the classes
 ZarthaxX: MSmits good luck with all those smito&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: geez, uni class videos take forever to watch
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: anyway, those videos are RL related
 MSmits: AntiSquid weren't you the one suggesting pytorch to me before?
 AntiSquid: videos i linked are shorter
 ZarthaxX: the topics are interesting
 AntiSquid: yes, but if you want to code from scratch there's no point reading an entire god damn paper for it
 AntiSquid: or more
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/43bb9930-430a-49b0-b10e-6b2f90b71ca9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/43bb9930-430a-49b0-b10e-6b2f90b71ca9</a>
 AntiSquid: just look at code .
 ZarthaxX: MSmits look at that lol
 MSmits: eh, seems i just lack 2 and 5?
 ZarthaxX: yeah well, but there are many others things before that
 ZarthaxX: that's the end
 MSmits: no doubt
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX o/
 MSmits: though... is go really a good place to start?
 MSmits: seems hard
 ZarthaxX: this thing tooPlaying Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learnin
 ZarthaxX: hi kiwoooooooooooo
 ZarthaxX: idk MSmits, maybe its baceuse of the recent boom with alphazzero
 ZarthaxX: howdy KiwiTae
 Unicorn123321: bye!
 KiwiTae: doin okii doin som ocv 
 KiwiTae: its your latest course?
 ZarthaxX: im not doing that
 ZarthaxX: it's not from my country
 ZarthaxX: actually im doing web stuff :rofl:
 AntiSquid: she looks mexican too
 MSmits: btw jacek, if you are going to try the score thing. Make sure you backpropagate extra seeds on oware on capture turns
 MSmits: thats an annoying part of scoreless states
 AntiSquid: woah ZarthaxX what web stuff are you doing now&#160;?
 AntiSquid: JS and friends or other&#160;?
 jacek: mhm
 ZarthaxX: js yes
 ZarthaxX: doing frontend and backend
 jacek: no one wants to be friends with js
 ZarthaxX: starting to get the hangs of things
 AntiSquid: ok and what do you want to achieve with it&#160;?
 Visqosity: hi
 AntiSquid: what stack are you aiming for&#160;? 
 MSmits: what stack?
 ZarthaxX: for now just doing some web restaurant menu so people order and that ends on a server
 AntiSquid: have you looked at freecodecamp btw&#160;? ZarthaxX 
 ZarthaxX: was going to go with react on the front and node on the back using express, classic combination i guess
 AntiSquid: stack refers to the tools you pick to use for your projects, for example MERN stack&#160;: mongodb express react node.js MSmits
 ZarthaxX: em no
 ZarthaxX: no database for now tho
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: i actually did a mongo db react tutorial&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: and express?
 MSmits: dont think it had express
 MSmits: it was a voting app
 ZarthaxX: mozilla course?
 MSmits: vote cat or dog :P
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: nvm
 ZarthaxX: lol :rofl:
 MSmits: it wasnt even all that easy
 MSmits: react is not my thing
 AntiSquid: express simplifies some of the stuff for you zarth
 MSmits: what the... he just wrote 6 lines of code and he's making a new file&#160;!?
 MSmits: kinda weird coming from making 1000 line bots in 1 file :P
 MSmits: I guess modularity in react is taken to extremes
 AntiSquid: if you used nodejs you probably automatically added express
 MSmits: maybe it did use that, not sure
 AntiSquid: it's like the pragmas everyone tends to add to c++ and forget they are there
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: almost
 MSmits: I got the tutorial from here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEXcg8xu2y0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEXcg8xu2y0</a>  Bit of a weird guy
 MSmits: but tutorial was ok
 MSmits: not sure if this link is part of the tutorial
 MSmits: I cant even remember why i even did this. Maybe this was the last experiment I did before finding CG?
 MSmits: live before CG is a blur
 MSmits: life
 AntiSquid: oh he has a video on glitch <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q22u2d4pQc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q22u2d4pQc</a> ... quick way to have an overview without setup headache :P
 MSmits: never heard of glitch
 ZarthaxX: i know express simplifies stuff, i dont know what other option exists anyway :P
 AntiSquid: too many&#160;?
 AntiSquid: idk
 ZarthaxX: like what
 AntiSquid: i picked one thing and sticked with that most of the time
 ZarthaxX: i meant for nodejs
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.slant.co/topics/4307/~express-js-alternatives">https://www.slant.co/topics/4307/~express-js-alternatives</a>
 ZarthaxX: never heard of any
 ZarthaxX: i will stick with express
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: alternatives to nodejs or express? @_@ if you want alternatives to node you basically change language ...
 ZarthaxX: i know alternatives to using nodejs
 ZarthaxX: i wanted to go for nodejs because i can share the js part in both front and back
 ZarthaxX: and because i wanted to learn it anyway
 AntiSquid: ya so did you check freecodecamp then&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: nopr
 AntiSquid: i mean best community for that kind of stuff
 AntiSquid: free, you can donate, tehy are worth it imo
 ZarthaxX: i will check when i can
 ZarthaxX: okay
 ZarthaxX: i have seen some stuff, but not much
 ZarthaxX: wowthe amount of courses it has
 ZarthaxX: 300hs 
 ZarthaxX: are they worth? mmhm
 AntiSquid: they're split into categories
 AntiSquid: mostly algorithms at the end, so just do the stuff you aren't familiar with
 ZarthaxX: i will check it, ty
 AntiSquid: np
 ZarthaxX: i was avoiding doing courses tho, as you tend to copy pasta a project that wasnt thought by yourself, and you end learning nothing 
 ZarthaxX: hate pages that say "paste this" and "now this"
 ZarthaxX: "take this free css"
 AntiSquid: lol, well it's web dev you should restyle it and there are millions of ready made styles / layouts out there
 MSmits: I prefer that to trying to copy whats being coded in a video though
 MSmits: I dislike video tutorials
 MSmits: much prefer written ones: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://catlikecoding.com/">https://catlikecoding.com/</a>  is awesome
 MSmits: (esp. the unity C# ones)
 ZarthaxX: i will try the frontend one about react, will see what happens :P
 AntiSquid: i mean once you know how shit works, you realize doing objects in css takes way too long so you are better off copying css unless you want to spend hours just adjusting some box sizes on your page
 ZarthaxX: nice url haha
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid yeah but having full control is cool
 ZarthaxX: i get it tho

 jacek: for 3 pieces its draw
 Doju: Anybody here?
 jacek: nope
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no
 Doju: ok nevermind then
 jacek:&#160;:}
 Doju: so I'm just stumped by this issue
 AntiSquid: i am Anybody
 jacek: anypony
 AntiSquid: woah
 AntiSquid: got to eject jace from chat
 Doju: i'm creating a class instance with the exact arguments that it wants
 Doju: yet "No mathcing function to call"
 Doju: (c++)
 AntiSquid: how do you know what it wants&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: show class and how you call
 therealbeef: the error message usually tells you what the mismatch is
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d3fcfd5-4c1f-4284-98c6-92eff53f2644">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d3fcfd5-4c1f-4284-98c6-92eff53f2644</a>
 Doju: Action(int(actionId), ActionType(type), Delta(delta), int(price), int(tomeIndex), int(taxCount), bool(castable), bool(repeatable))
 Doju: "no matching function for call to 'Action::Action(int, ActionType, Delta, int, int, int, bool, bool)'"
 AntiSquid: uhm ... 
 Doju: I've been trying to figure this out for hours&#160;:|
 AntiSquid: just post the entire struct
 AntiSquid: or the default constructor
 AntiSquid: and then the line where you create new object maybe would be helpful&#160;?
 3569066: mhm
 AntiSquid: wait 
 AntiSquid: nvm, just proceed sharing because it's not clear what you're doing
 therealbeef: have you tried: Action a = { ... };
 Doju: erm
 3569066: sounds like fall challenge
 Doju: therealbeef i just tried that as you sent that message
 Doju: ide no longer complains about it
 LMGator: hello:grinning:
 AntiSquid: A
 AntiSquid: HA!
 LMGator: hello
 Doju: so there's a difference between Type t = Type(args) and Type t{args}...
 therealbeef: afaik the compiler doesnt generate a constructor with arguments for you
 Doju: ohhh I see
 LMGator: hello
 Doju: I'm still not quite sure why I want to learn the language hahah
 Doju: but anyways thanks for the help everybody!
 Doju: and derjack indeed, i'm translating my python program to c++
 AntiSquid: which game&#160;?
 Doju: fall challenge
 AntiSquid: oh ya you'll need it ...
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: I'm only getting like 2k different gamestates with python
 aspace:       
 Doju: that's good for a dumb search up to the amazing depth of... 2 or 3 :D
 therealbeef: Action a = {...}; is more like a structured assignment I guess, while Action(...) is a constructor call. But don't feel bad; initialization is one of the most complex/confusing parts of c++
 therealbeef: There are even situations where the compiler parses an initialization as a function declaration. See: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/01/30/most-vexing-parse/">https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/01/30/most-vexing-parse/</a>
 therealbeef: Like: Action a();
 therealbeef: this doesnt create an object a of type Action&#160;;-)
 therealbeef: There are some legendary bugs involving mutex locks and this parsing
 Doju: ugh, c++ is so bizarre
 Doju: A friend of mine called javascript a "chewing gum" language
 AntiSquid: your opinion before you've seen meta programming or after&#160;?
 Doju: In the sense that features have been haphazardly stuck on during the years
 Doju: but c++, at least from a beginner's perspective, seems doubly so
 therealbeef: yeah there's too much legacy
 Doju: I don't even know what that is, AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: then you don't know what c++ weirdness is either
 Doju: oh dear
 Doju: i just googled metaprogramming
 Doju: that must be fun.
 Doju: ./s
 therealbeef: the syntax of template metaprogramming is getting better though
 AntiSquid: well listened to some seriously deep topics on it and i must say ... i missed parts of it, got the big picture, but not everything
 therealbeef: with constexpr-if, concepts, etc it gets a lot cleaner
 therealbeef: relatively
 therealbeef: pre-C++11 it was really d*gsh*t
 Doju: oh my god
 Doju: i think it compiled
 Doju: :o
 Doju: yess!
 Doju: now to figure out how to combine my files

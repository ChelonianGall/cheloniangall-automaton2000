 jrke: damn my depth minimax bot in python can defeat depth 8 minimax bot of c++ mine :nerd:
 jrke: i think cause bugs in my c++ bot
 jrke: depth 2 minimax bot in python*

 Andriamanitra: this clash has no business being approved and at +3 votes
 Lisker_the_slow: wassup programerssss
 Uwafuwa: :smile:
 The_Else: hello everybody
 jacek: good morning
 marcal279: morninggg
 marcal279: or rather afternoon now
 Passifi: mornin'
 Passifi: marcal i don't know what you're talking about it is morning in the correct part of the world :P
 Stilgart: it's always morning, we are in a chat here&#160;;)
 TSC: Test
 DarkDiamonD: Test passed.
 Allstreamer_: noice
 MSmits: morning
 jrke: morning ms recurse took your othello 
 jacek: *our* othello
 MSmits: for a day
 jacek: 99902 chatacters, phew
 MSmits: lol what?
 MSmits: did you nearly fill your bot?
 jacek: yeah, though i didnt minify the c. probably could get 2-3k chars
 MSmits: ahh yeah
 MSmits: small program then, I would be able to get 10
 MSmits: 10k
 MSmits: easily
 jacek: hmm without weights its 26k
 MSmits: ah yes, so you can get much more
 MSmits: should be able to get down to 6k or less
 MSmits: i have never had to do that thankfully
 jrke: btw how do you compress them?bz2?
 MSmits: minifier
 jrke: whats that?
 MSmits: there's free browser thingies
 jacek: i dont use any compression
 MSmits: or stuff you can down load
 MSmits: google it jrke
 MSmits: btw, i need to teach a class, ttyl&#160;:)
 jacek: teach a struct
 MSmits: :P
 Gabriel_IUT: how to solve the othello problem 
 jrke: thats not problem its multiplayer game write your bot submit it and see where it stands in front of other players and then again improve you bot and submit
 jacek: there is othello puzzle, jrke
 jacek: that why the multiplayer game has othello-1
 jrke: oh sorry i forgot
 Velcoro: @Andriamanitra if you have a bunch of approvers, you can have anything aproved (check other top quality contributions of this author and his approvers)

 MSmits: gj
 MSmits: your rewrite?
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: it has 68% winrate against old version. but to beat reBless i need something fundamentally different
 Lisker_the_slow: what language do you use &gt;
 Lisker_the_slow:&#160;?
 struct: othello puzzle of the week :tada:
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: C++ mostly
 jacek: and it is othello game, not othello puzzle
 struct: c++ on multis, javascript on puzzles
 MSmits: c++ on multis, C#/C++ on contests. C#/python on puzzles
 MSmits: oh and python on clashes, if i ever care to
 MSmits: basically i go from python -&gt; C# -&gt; c++ the more time i have available
 jacek: and -&gt; assembly
 MSmits: lol one time i tried that, never again
 Angecide: Hi, I was wondering how people in uttt calculate their win&#160;% during the game, are they dividing how many nodes their solver has proved win with loss or something else?
 jacek: i use score / visits
 jacek: of the chosen node
 Angecide: I see
 jacek: if you use [0, 0.5, 1] score then its score/visits
 jacek: if [-1,0,1] scale accordingly
 Angecide: ye that makes sense, on anoter note, I was gonna work on a NN for evaluating uttt board, but it turns out to be more pain than gain, and I also figured out from reading old CG logs that I should probably work on clever heuristic, since it is possible to reach top 10 with just good heuristic and fast mcts solver
 jacek: only reBless uses NN successfully
 Angecide: translating old discussions in #ru gave me some ideas
 jacek: top legend is just performance-fest and some heuristics
 Angecide: does recurse use NN for his uttt bot?
 Angecide: the one that is top 1 in leaderboard
 jacek: yes. he only recently submitted
 Angecide: yea I see
 struct: He also tried it long ago
 struct: with no success
 struct: he managed legend IIRC
 forgatsby: Hi Guys
 struct: hi
 Angecide: btw, I always wondered, why is it that you can still keep computing for a short period during enemy turn? 
 Angecide: it's like a high risk high reward strategy, since it can sometimes give timeouts
 struct: you cant
 struct: when you output your process gets paused
 struct: after opponent outputs it resumes
 struct: This is why you might get timeouts
 Angecide: I presume the 100ms is my turn, and anything that exceeds that is part of the enemy turn right?
 struct: no
 struct: 100msprintif you use time here
 struct: it will overlap on next turn
 struct: like
 struct: 100msprint()20ms
 struct: on next turn you will have 80
 struct: because you already used 20 on that turn
 struct: maybe im not explaining well&#160;:/
 Angecide: ye I am trying to wrap my head around it, I think it makes sense, but I am using 109ms every time it is my turn, and I can play a lot of games with no timeouts
 struct: When do you start your timer?
 Angecide: right before my mcts loop, I don't start it when I receive enemy imputs
 struct: The timer should start after reading first input
 Angecide: ye that's what I mean, I am using way more than 100ms on my turn
 struct: Yeah but you might get timeouts sometimes
 Angecide: using 109 ms is a safe duration, 110ms is high risk but still doable with no timeouts
 struct: in ide or arena?
 Angecide: arena
 struct: i tried and dont get timeouts aswell
 Angecide: submit and reach high ranking in legend
 struct: 10ms wont give me that much of an advantage
 struct: I would need to rewrite my bot
 Angecide: but, to my original question, do u have a theory on why this is possible?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/timeouts-how-do-they-work/24504/4">https://forum.codingame.com/t/timeouts-how-do-they-work/24504/4</a>
 Angecide: oh I see, so it is indeed an intended high risk strategy
 TwilightImp_1204: 1
 jacek: i used 95ms in bt and ocassionaly timeouted

 1400179: A+
 Kitkat260: wow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm gonna submit it anyways
 eulerscheZahl: that map was unlucky, PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: for another one you shared there would have been a way to find another safe cell
 RoboStac: can't you tell that square must be a mine&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: not always
 eulerscheZahl: there's only 1 validator. but random generated after your first click
 RoboStac: there are 3 empty squares, a 2 with no mines and some ones that share the corner
 RoboStac: no, I mean on that specific replay
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't check non-adjacent subgroups
 struct: that one was solvable yes

 eulerscheZahl: so you have the real minesweeper experience. authentic port to CG
 1400179: I give it 5% out of 100
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my win&#160;% is around 16%
 eulerscheZahl: good enough to submit but can still be improved
 PatrickMcGinnisII: which is better than it was it was at 7%
 eulerscheZahl: how did you get those numbers? click "play" that often?
 varName: Is this app enough to prepare for interviews?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: took me 4 submits

 eulerscheZahl: i couldn't resist, I'll show the door to myself&#160;:(
 struct: Well I cant reproduce it, so I think its not important
 reCurse: Server hiccup probably
 reCurse: Thanks though
 DomiKo: struct doing some Chess?
 reCurse: I'm starting to regret a bit the 50ms because the hiccups won't get fixed and it's going to cause issues
 reCurse: But it's either that or give up pairings, so unacceptable
 eulerscheZahl: or having some more fun with the SDK and find a way around
 eulerscheZahl: the build process just includes a framework that handles some things for you and defines the constraints
 eulerscheZahl: but i guess you could just copy-paste the whole SDK and include it in your contribution rather then referencing it via Maven
 eulerscheZahl: and then adjust whatever you don't like
 reCurse: I'm sure they would approve of me busting the time limit...
 reCurse: Unless you mean there's a way to do explicit pairing by fiddling the SDK?

 JLukeSkywalker: if designing a road based game/puzzle, should the cars be on the left or the right?
 JLukeSkywalker: wont actually affect input/output, just the visual
 JLukeSkywalker: Output Line 1: True if in US, False otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: US isn't the only country where they drive on the right, yk
 JLukeSkywalker: the output line was a joke
 JLukeSkywalker: just want to know in general on here, should it be right or left
 eulerscheZahl: i vote for right but doesn't really matter
 eulerscheZahl: make it a toggle in the viewer :P
 eulerscheZahl: draw cards on both sides and use the DebugModule to hide one at a time
 jacek: also the speed should be in km/h, not that heresy mph
 eulerscheZahl: cars, not cards
 eulerscheZahl: m/s
 eulerscheZahl: SI-units
 jacek: so when there sign with 100, that means 100 m/s?

 Westicles: You could do monopoly, but figuring out trading would be tricky
 ErrorRazor: If you want an RNG-heavy game, yahtzee would be much easier to make than monopoly :p
 eulerscheZahl: snakes and ladders
 JBM: yahtzee… that'd be horrible
 eulerscheZahl: regarding the big dictionary @Westiclesgive it to the bot in the first turn?
 eulerscheZahl: and include the list in the referee
 ErrorRazor: Exactly, don't waste extra time making the horror more complex
 BlaiseEbuth: Why not 421&#160;? :D
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see why jahtzee should be more random than troll vs castle
 <b>**eulerscheZahl knows the game as Kniffel</b></p><p><img src="/a/55595180001313" /> Westicles: the official scrabble dictionary is 100k words...
 ErrorRazor: yuge
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how much input we can read in 1 turn but 100k probably exceeds that
 jacek: MSmits you havent your C4 results in 2 days. the suspense is killing me
 eulerscheZahl: how about taking the full list of words in the referee but only sending a subset to the players each time?
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: that would also ensure that each game is different
 eulerscheZahl: no hardcoding, books or anything
 Westicles: that's a great idea
 Westicles: make it so
 Astrobytes: I was thinking this, dependent on the validators you can send the appropriate subset
 eulerscheZahl: wait, is that for a puzzle or multiplayer?
 eulerscheZahl: or optim
 Astrobytes: Optim I presume
 Astrobytes: AZ style
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 Westicles: I was thinking multi
 Astrobytes: Interesting...
 Westicles: I was going to try to make an optim just like Alz, but the winner published his code...

 jacek: last week was in late evening
 duckymirror: Is Rust code compiled in release mode when I test it in the IDE?
 Astrobytes: Yes, they fixed that issue.
 duckymirror: That explains why my integers overflow without crashing... :sweat_smile:
 duckymirror: Thanks!
 Astrobytes: haha, no worries
 jacek: rust...
 jacek: oh wait, that why rebless could test against dbdr
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they fixed it before a contest iirc
 Astrobytes: It's on the forum/discord somewhere
 Astrobytes: "rebless" :D
 struct: they fixed it during fc 2020
 struct: they were "forced" too
 Astrobytes: That was because of "rebless" right
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: I remember now.
 struct: If they fixed rust and didnt fix C#
 struct: he could have done the same
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 jacek: done what?
 duckymirror: I miss my overflow panics... And those inlined functions in stack traces are pretty confusing too:grinning:
 Astrobytes: Can you not activate a debug mode prior to submitting? e.g. like with a C++ pragma directive?
 Astrobytes: So you can deactivate it when you submit I mean.
 duckymirror: I don't know a way to do that, but I'm far from being a Rust expert
 jacek: just pump some oxygen into iron
 Astrobytes: Just seems like since Rust already thought of everything else they would have thought of that too :D
 Astrobytes: I do like the fact that the Rust mascot is called Ferris.
 duckymirror: They didn't make Rust for environments without access to the configuration
 XIlayPVPX: Yo, if anyone did "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" how do I look at others' solutions?
 XIlayPVPX: my solution was super long and stupid
 XIlayPVPX: and I'm hoping that the guy who wrote the question didn't intend for the programmer to test every single possible scenario individually
 JLukeSkywalker: if you have solved it, clicking results should show other's solutions
 XIlayPVPX: got it, I guess I gotta finish up the code
 struct: jacek with rust you could check if it was on arena or ide
 struct: if it was on ide you could just crash the bot
 struct: Same with C#
 JLukeSkywalker: nvm, its on the main problem page after you solve it
 struct: you only needed to check debug flag
 JLukeSkywalker: any good resources for optimizing java run times? My referee is pretty slow
 darkhorse64: Your game should use degrees instead of radians. It's much more intuitive
 Astrobytes: Looks fun though.
 Astrobytes: Also, game turns and such are modifiable from the SDK no?
 struct: what do you mean astro?
 MSmits: jacek

 jacek:&#160;?
 struct: wow
 MSmits: you asked
 Astrobytes: To change number of turns/times etc struct
 MSmits: oh damn
 jacek: ivalid id
 MSmits: that still doesnt work
 MSmits: let me just put it in the connect4 thread
 struct: yeah its possible
 struct: gameManager.setMaxTurns()
 struct: gameManager.setTurnTimeout
 Astrobytes: JLukeSkywalker was looking to increase his turns
 Astrobytes: for Tanks
 MSmits: jacek updated. Nearly to 1M games
 struct: ah I didnt read
 struct: if he wants to make it 4 players
 struct: he can go up to 150 turns per player using 50ms earch
 struct: so 600 turns total
 Astrobytes: Maybe reply to his forum thread (just noticed he made one)
 Astrobytes: Nice work MSmits
 MSmits: thanks, hope there's no bug in it lol
 MSmits: wouldnt be the first time i notice one after weeks
 Astrobytes: Heh. There's a reason for those proofs in the papers you know :P
 struct: MSmits I want the meta for Amazons /s
 MSmits: it wouldn't get past ply 1 :P
 struct: About the optimizations I cant help him much
 struct: I just write bad java code
 struct: and my contributions are very simple
 MSmits: it will be interesting to see how re curse solves amazons
 struct: I wonder how well NN do there
 jacek: especially MLP with friendship extension
 MSmits: pretty sure it's doable, but output will be different
 Astrobytes: Might work better as a component of a multi-faceted solution
 Astrobytes: Haven't checked papers recently
 JLukeSkywalker: sry, was afk. was thinking about degrees instead of radians, simple swap on my end, can do it. I know how to set the turn number and time limit per turn, its just that my referee takes so long that I am hitting the maximum game time. 
 JLukeSkywalker: also very sorry, its a simple program so i didnt comment it, didnt need to. will upload a commented version in a bit

 struct: Someone tried to solve it :scream:
 JLukeSkywalker: I think most of the issue is that I'm using an arraylist of bullets and doing a double for loop for collisions
 struct: Can bullets collide with bullets?
 JLukeSkywalker: no, just active players
 JLukeSkywalker: so its currently for bullet:for player:check
 JLukeSkywalker: which works, but is slow
 darkhorse64: add shield and collision for tanks :innocent:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: potw notification struct
 struct: nice
 darkhorse64: only a half joke actually
 Astrobytes: I actually agree
 Astrobytes: What was that game... Robot Wars? It was in Java, you had a robot with a turret and a radar
 JLukeSkywalker: robocode
 darkhorse64: maybe a cooldown for the gun. Too many bullets
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's it JLukeSkywalker
 JLukeSkywalker: * the inspiration&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Aha!&#160;:)
 jacek: and puzzle of the week notification
 JLukeSkywalker: wanted to keep it as simple as possible as it is already decently complex. might add a league with tank collision, healing if your bullet hits, and other goodies
 Astrobytes: Already said it jacek
 jacek: :s
 struct: I was hoping for the type of map that I once tried to make
 struct: were you can wrap around
 JLukeSkywalker: for the tank game?
 struct: yeah, I attempted to do something similar
 struct: but never finished
 JLukeSkywalker: its like 1 line of code to swap mine to that, just felt odd
 struct: not 1 line
 struct: at least it wasnt for what I was trying to do
 JLukeSkywalker: the way i did my edge detection, i just swap where i have 0, height, and width
 JLukeSkywalker: and it wraps instead of absolute border
 struct: Removing debug messages might increase your referee speed
 Astrobytes: Wraparound for Tanks doesn't seem right imo
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i thought about corner abusing
 darkhorse64: No disrespect for what you have done already but I think you need to make the game more complex while avoiding a Coders of the Carribean clone
 Astrobytes: Turret rotation, radar, etc
 Astrobytes: (imo)
 struct: ah you dont have debug messages my bad, I missread
 JLukeSkywalker: the controls and firing are very different, you have a turret control, and the actual bullet paths are different. I do want to add things like collision, but want to just get this workign first
 jacek: MSmits rebooking?
 darkhorse64: No worries, we are brainstorming
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, no insults taken at all
 struct: im surprised to see that 
 struct: gameManager.addToGameSummary(player.getAvatarToken() + " was hit by " + firer.getAvatarToken());
 struct: works
 struct: But doesnt show avatars
 Astrobytes: (the fact we're giving ideas it means we're interested :P )
 struct: I guess it gets replaced by player.getNicknameToken()
 JLukeSkywalker: oh lol, was the other one depreciated?
 struct: The other one
 struct: is to get the avatar
 struct: But it still shows the name for some reason
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe because i smashed it into a text field
 MSmits: jacek ofcourse
 MSmits: would not be fair to you if i skipped on re curse
 reCurse: Is this really how you're going to play this?
 MSmits: of course not, I was kidding
 Astrobytes: (not)
 MSmits: I was, poor joke maybe
 Astrobytes: You went from MSBits to MBook
 MSmits: dont be sensitive about it though reCurse, i did give fair warning about Othello
 reCurse: Despicable
 jacek: maybe if more players with strong bots appear, the situation will be better
 MSmits: Onitama is a better game, no issues there
 MSmits: jacek i think you may be right
 Astrobytes: Ah lol, I didn't see your submit until now.
 reCurse: What a joke
 MSmits: i was not sure before
 MSmits: but othello does take a lot of codesize, so i guess so, i think i would get tired of it before i ran out though
 MSmits: reCurse if it really bothers you so much, i can just turn off the book and resubmit, i'll be top 10 somewhere
 MSmits: but the thing is
 MSmits: the method is out there
 MSmits: if not me...
 MSmits: well actually old john is already doing it (check out all the draws in my last submit, those are perfect games)
 MSmits: this is a serious question by the way reCurse, I am not here to annoy people to this degree, if you want me to turn it off, i'll turn it off
 MSmits: and no hard feelings
 struct: just blame the creator for not adding forced openings
 struct: :D
 struct: illl take the blame
 MSmits: nah struct, at that point you could not have known
 MSmits: I didn't either 
 MSmits: well i didnt know it would be that easy
 struct: Yeah, I dont do research on the games I port tbh
 struct: I just ask for suggestions and do it
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you non-forced-opening-multi-creator. Burn!!!
 Astrobytes: :P
 jacek: yinsh hasnt opening issues, has it
 MSmits: thats an interesting game
 MSmits: needs more players, but i'd do paper soccer first i think
 jacek: try to book that
 struct: So many games and I was thinking on starting to code Havannah
 Astrobytes: struct, you can make a contrib with the forced openings for othello 
 Astrobytes: Private or public, whatever
 MSmits: perhaps it's possible to have an agreement between me and old john to remove the books? 
 MSmits: or just me, old johns book isnt nearly as good, though he does victimize dbdr i think
 Astrobytes: Others book to some extent too
 jacek: nah, if its classic game then books are part of it
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: I dont feel bad for using them in oware, but in othello i do kinda
 MSmits: cuz therés no way to stop it 
 MSmits: in connect4 I'm just trying to see if i can solve the game, never solved a game that big before
 MSmits: maybe it will take a year :P
 jacek: what other game you solved then
 Astrobytes: jacek bringing the shade
 MSmits: TTT and some optim stuff
 MSmits: i solved some cotr phrases :P
 Astrobytes: How is the search going?
 MSmits: oh, got to rank 21. I have a good search now for non-loopy stuff
 MSmits: it's very easy to search if you assume there are no loops possible
 Astrobytes: Nice. Yeah, that makes sense.
 struct: Are you fully solving?
 struct: or is weakly solved?
 MSmits: one phrase was funny. I did a manual solution for 292 chars
 MSmits: then i did a BS with 2.5 million beamwidth
 MSmits: and the optimal solution was.... 292 chars
 MSmits: checker with someone else and he also had 292 for this one
 Astrobytes: 1st LOL @ "2.5 million beamwidth"2nd... well&#160;:)
 MSmits: struct i solved only tiny ones for now, but with a meta mcst and hashing  and more pruning i feel like i should be able to solve those &lt;100 sized ones
 struct: yeah, but you are only solving from starting position right?
 MSmits: or do you mean in general? If you mean for board games, i always do weakly
 struct: or do all states get solved?
 struct: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Until he convinces a university to lend him all their computing power.
 MSmits: strongly solving is really rare because you need to know the best move from every state
 MSmits: i would be afraid to find a bug after a million cpu hours :P
 Astrobytes: What you never tell them, they will never know . . .
 MSmits: it's one of the reason i run on 1 cpu core at a time, so i dont waste too much when i make a mistake
 MSmits: in a sense i did solve a lot of "games" from a certain position. Like a uttt game 22 plies in or something
 MSmits: i'm always solving stuff, just not whole games
 Astrobytes: Also (back to original topic) I have a feeling that reCurse is gonna train against you hard and beat you again.
 MSmits: well if he submits another version i may just let him that time
 reCurse: No I'm done playing these stupid games. Hope you feel you deserve it.
 MSmits: as I said, i can turn it off... it obviously bothers you
 reCurse: What were you expecting? Congratulations?
 jacek: no. he said it doesnt bother him.
 jacek: so it doesnt bother him
 MSmits: reCurse nah, not really
 Astrobytes: Oi, where's that competitiveness
 DJNinjaSpoon_37b8: fortnite
 aidanv77: damn that shit look like it belong in fortnite
 AntiSquid: what shit
 aidanv77: that shit
 AntiSquid: fortnite is the shit&#160;:/
 aidanv77: ok
 MSmits: that's actually a positive thing to say about it i think AntiSquid
 aidanv77: lmao
 MSmits: that's how the youngsters talk
 AntiSquid: meant it literally 
 aidanv77: the youngsters hahah
 MSmits: yeah i dont tihnk he got that
 aidanv77: i got it 
 AntiSquid: sorry for negativity, enjoy your game
 MSmits: who is this who stole AntiSquid's account
 MSmits: the real AntiSquid would not back down from a burn
 MSmits: pile on the fortnite bashing :P
 AntiSquid: i don't see the problem, let the man enjoy his shit
 MSmits: yeah I guess that's ok. If he didnt play fortnite he would just do something else silly, like the other youngsters
 MSmits: how is it going AntiSquid?
 MSmits: did you hear we got the riots too here
 AntiSquid: yes 
 AntiSquid: been doing some work in a vaccination center, highlight of the month ... all month?! :thinking:
 MSmits: oh.. is this voluntary helping out? Or a job?
 MSmits: or something in between maybe?
 AntiSquid: more like since i work from home and have nothing else to do atm, might as well do this
 aidanv77: damn bro my balls be stickin to my dick
 MSmits: that's really cool of you AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: idk it's really dull
 MSmits: doesn't matter really
 struct: aidan stop trolling
 aidanv77: im not trolling
 MSmits: you're helping
 JLukeSkywalker: clash wont let me test or submit
 JLukeSkywalker: but site isnt lagging?
 TFisicaro: it's painfully slow
 IlkerSaxion: Yeah
 thanhhv317: have a good day everyone
 Wings_of_Safety: hey any idea why my solved puzzles all say 0% even though I have 100% on them and achievements for them?
 struct: Somtiems it takes a bit to update Wings_of_Safety
 Rodrigo_the_coder: lol
 Rodrigo_the_coder: what is W_o_S

 Rebollo: Guys
 Rebollo: How can I create a copy of this root guy
 Rebollo: GolfGame *root = new GolfGame(matrixOfArea, height, width);
 Rebollo: I want to create a copy, not a reference of root
 Andriann: Hi guys, I wanna solve the cash back problem if you know the link? please
 jacek: happy Caturday
 DialFrost: jacek only says 2 things
 DialFrost: happy caturday
 DialFrost: or
 DialFrost: oO
 DialFrost: :P
 Uljahn: oh my :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 jacek: nyoro~n
 IrisLh: Time to get off:grinning:
 DAREdevil001: shit
 DAREdevil001: too diffcult
 Rem7y: how play this game?
 Rem7y: I dont undestand
 DialFrost: i have a protest to make about bots
 DialFrost: lol
 DialFrost: they can solve hard puzzles that normal people cant solve in time
 DialFrost: ...
 DAREdevil001: I'm nearly crazy,my English is poor
 Khoaa: how to play

 FORMS1: With the ASCII art puzzle - the size of the string of text "T" is unknown. I"m assuming I'm going to need to break the string apart into its individual characters. Does that mean this puzzle requires dynamic arrays?
 5DN1L: Does the constraint "0 &lt; N &lt; 200" help you decide?
 FORMS1: Ah constraints
 FORMS1: that notion is gonna sink in pretty quick
 FORMS1: thanks!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Nachosauce: Man I need to get better at writing fast code. The actual logic of this challenge is easy, but my code isn't fast enough
 Khoaa: Same
 miyucode: hi
 miyucode: hru here&#160;?
 Khoaa: hi
 ScienceGuy66: this is cool
 jacek: code not fast enough? it timeouts? :v
 Ose: I am back
 Ose: wow I'm sure tired
 Ose: You guys want to enter the logo lift-off competition
 Ose: that's all i want to say
 jacek: hm? thats for 4-11 years old
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. You're not 4yo yet jacek? :o
 ArslaneB: Is there any Apache Spark Quiz / Exercices on codingame&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: CG is about programming and algorithmic so nope.
 MSmits: We don't have spark quizzes&#160;!?
 MSmits: :cry:
 BlaiseEbuth: [CG]Impersonate! MSmits is being sarcastic, ban him and delete his account, he'll make new users flee from the chat! :angry:
 Master_Zain: lies
 jacek: Automaton2000 there's spark in you
 Automaton2000: but will be hard to beat
 jacek: thats what she said, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: still a lot of time on that puzzle
 MSmits: well BlaiseEbuth you are being ageist toward jacek. It's not his fault he is young
 MSmits: I for one, find it amazing a 3 yr old can code a neural network
 jacek: boldly of you to assume &lt;4 is 3
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not me! That's Ose who shared this shocking non-inclusive contest!
 MSmits: :smile_cat:
 jacek: stil metamctsing oware?
 MSmits: yeah, your bot is ridiculous. It makes 0 mistakes in most games, in the first 12 seeds 
 MSmits: I do the lookup after 12 seeds and it usually comes down to 0, meaning a draw when my bot plays yours perfectly
 jacek: and wins against robo, but loses to royale or oldjohn
 jacek: and they lose to robo
 BlaiseEbuth: Well I suppose a majority of foetus create a neural network at some point of their development MSmits, though not all so performant...
 MSmits: yeah but the mistakes it makes are probably later in the game. Let me find one of those and analyze it for you
 MSmits: or share 1 with me. I'll tell you where it goes wrong
 MSmits: true BlaiseEbuth
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/604085338">https://www.codingame.com/replay/604085338</a>
 MSmits: I can analyze this one easily <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/604085338">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/604085338</a>. Action is early on so it quickly hits my book
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: that one too
 MSmits: i'll do yours
 jacek: its the same
 jacek: at frame 50 it says -0.4, at frame -0.7, at 120 and laters around -0.6, until the proven loss at 178
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: Seems Royale makes the first mistake at frame 13. My meta mcts did not explore that move much because it seems bad. I am exploring it now. It's near the endgame book so I really think it's a mistake. I'll keep looking once I solve it to find your mistakes
 jacek: anyway when i spam submit i can pull robo down
 MSmits: your bot makes a losing move at frame 15
 MSmits: it's solved after that, so when you capture to 5-8
 MSmits: that's 35 seeds left on the board so it's a lookup for me
 MSmits: move 8 (2nd from right) would have won 
 MSmits: I think the guys that claimed to have solved oware the first time found that captures are not the best move 15% of the time
 MSmits: it's not strange that bots are biased toward capturing though, especially if the hurt only happens much later
 jacek: 5-8?
 MSmits: yeah when you capture, the score
 jacek: i have 6
 jacek: or you mean your lookup
 MSmits: when you capture it goes from 5-6 to 5-8
 MSmits: that's the losing move
 jacek: 5-6:

 jacek: hm
 MSmits: but you pick 11 don't you?
 MSmits: it's not the worst move btw, just not the best
 jacek: that was before
 jacek: at frame 15
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9495ec46-6d90-4227-b643-3e5b210afcb8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9495ec46-6d90-4227-b643-3e5b210afcb8</a>
 MSmits: ohh so close
 MSmits: 8 was the best move&#160;:)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/e33iOoU">https://imgur.com/a/e33iOoU</a>
 MSmits: this is flipped with you as the first player
 MSmits: [-2.-2] is optimistic and pessimistic value
 MSmits: equal so solved as -2
 MSmits: and you're 1 point ahead
 MSmits: so you lose
 MSmits: the other one is [0,-0]
 MSmits: well not -0, just 0
 MSmits: 4th move is unsolved but has bad stats
 MSmits: and so close to book that's very reliable
 MSmits: up to Royale's mistake this is a line of play that over 700k games played, probably very common in your training also. I think his mistake confused your bot, gave you a gamestate less known to it
 geppoz: question for python users: it is safe to remove from a set while iterating in it?
 geppoz: I mean, if I do:
 geppoz: for i in myset:
 geppoz:  if (...): myset.discard(i)
 geppoz: I can still be sure all set are iterated once?
 jacek: no
 jacek: RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration
 geppoz:&#160;:(
 geppoz: that is weird
 ScienceGuy66:&#160;:(
 ScienceGuy66:&#160;:)
 geppoz: that means that if I have a very large set, there is a big overhead in duplication
 Gorkath: Hi everyone
 Pallussa: good morning&#160;!
 jacek: morning :thinking:
 Pallussa: depends where you are I guess XD
 dpdog: sus
 Wontonimo: hey geppoz, if it is a list then you can use something like
 Wontonimo: i = 0while i &lt; len(mylist):
 Wontonimo:    if will_remove_item:
 BlaiseEbuth: geppoz got an answer from the future :o
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: according to my screen, he asked at 10:56am and I replied at 1:08pm
 Wontonimo: i guess the timezones got messed up in the display
 Wontonimo: on your screen
 BlaiseEbuth: No matter the timezone, the answer came 2 hours after the question.
 Wontonimo: or 20 sec after I logged in
 BlaiseEbuth: Still
 Wontonimo: :clock-without-hands:

 Astrobytes: only if you make it 3D and open world
 Zorg1: and don't forget to add the FoW
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: and you can move by fractional squares
 Wontonimo: like warhammer
 Wontonimo: linear distance with rotation
 Astrobytes: screw that, add physics, continuous movements
 Wontonimo: and a NN for each unit for it to execute it's own battle tactics
 Astrobytes: give the pieces limbs
 Wontonimo: and tissue layers
 Wontonimo: with fluids to squirt out
 Astrobytes: let the king go off to the er, pawn shop to get reinforcements
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: pawn shop
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 jacek: :door:
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 BlaiseEbuth: Let the king do economic layoff on pawns and sell board-cells to the bank.
 Astrobytes: getting into monopoly territory here
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... What about TV debate between kings?
 Astrobytes: sounds doable
 jacek: i know! lets make breakthrough960 to get rid of the openings
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: breakthrough1 :grin:

 CaI3B: hii im new to this, 
 Dren: hello new to this
 Josdel: hello i'm hot
 Wontonimo: open a window and let some cool air in :rolling_eyes: 
 Josdel: thanks for u recommendation
 Wontonimo: feeling better now?
 Wontonimo: it may be covid
 PringleOrange: How much CP would you get if you get 1st place in a clash of code with 8 people in?
 PringleOrange: Also, how much total CP would I approximately need to get into the top 10k globally?
 Wontonimo: 2 questions there:  first quesiton I'm not going to answer but instead inform you that you are better off getting CP from doing multis like coders strikes back than from Clash.
 Wontonimo: Second, you can look up the global leaderboard to find what CP you need for what level

 Josdel: Wontomino
 Josdel: nice nickname
 PringleOrange: ah thank you, where can i find these multis?
 Josdel: original
 Josdel: :hmmm:
 Dorak: Please don't ban Josdel, he's my only friend on this.
 Wontonimo: PringleOrange <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 PringleOrange: Thanks man
 Wontonimo: try "line racing" (aka Tron light cycles)
 Wontonimo: or "mad pod racing" (aka Coders Strikes Back)
 PringleOrange: ah, are those the easy ones? i like the easy ones
 Wontonimo: me too Pringle, me too
 Wontonimo: yeah, those two are pretty easy.
 Wontonimo: try mad pod racing first
 Wontonimo: it gives you a tutorial
 PringleOrange: ah tysm!
 Josdel: wontonimo
 Josdel: are you pro?
 Wontonimo: your first job will be to notice that the code they give you has an error
 Josdel: :nerd:
 PringleOrange: yeah
 Wontonimo: when the code should use X,Y coords, it in error uses Y,Y.
 Wontonimo: easy fix, change the code to be X,Y
 Wontonimo: pro what Josdel&#160;?
 Josdel: coding
 Wontonimo: pro-grammer&#160;?  sure am
 Josdel: :0
 Dorak: 1vs1 rn. :sunglasses:
 Dorak: okno.
 Josdel: want to play a clash with some friends?
 Wontonimo: no
 tyvenom: give you guys props alot of you guys are really good. 
 Wontonimo: how long have you been coding tyvenom&#160;?
 tyvenom: I started learning since may of last year. just started learning python.
 Wontonimo: you may really like this resource for python <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>

 Josdel: oooo
 tyvenom: Thanks so much ill check them out! ive been taking udemy courses etc.. 
 Josdel: :open_mouth:
 Josdel: thanks for the content
 Wontonimo: noooooo don't give udemy your money for their crap course
 tyvenom: haha i also got stackskills courses.
 tyvenom: any courses you recommend?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i would recommend what my aikido teacher said about learning martial arts.  practice every day.  practice the same things till it is perfect
 tyvenom: My thing is the only coding i can really do is on my phone with work. So im limited being next to a computer. 
 Wontonimo: in the morning, wake up and write a small program from memory and understanding, not using google or any kind of autocomplete.  Try to write the whole program and make it run with 1 compile
 Wontonimo: something like&#160;: calculate the first 100 prime numbers
 tyvenom: interesting. ill def try to do that. I did debate on taking like a coding bootcamp. But i dont know how great they are.
 Wontonimo: you can write it out on paper.  seriously.  then type it in when you get home.
 tyvenom: hm thats a good idea. I appreciate the ideas!
 Blokops: it migh be a bit adavnac ebut code golf is amazing for learning the langauge in and outs
 tyvenom: code golf is a website?
 Wontonimo: compare programming to reading.  if you had trouble spelling every work and had to look up grammar rules for every 4 to 5 words in a row, you'd suck at writing and reading.  You have to first MASTER the absolute basics
 Blokops: is a contest in this page
 tyvenom: thanks im really new to this page like just joined lol
 Blokops: example of code golf

 tyvenom: I heard mixed signals on that someone said just key bind set up keybinds and skip all the basics. I been doing the basics for a bit.
 Blokops: shameless requestCan someone review my clash of code submission

 Blokops: fair deal
 PringleOrange: hi, what do i do for line racing on bot programming multi?
 Blokops: for line racing you mean a race condition&#160;?
 PringleOrange: yeah
 Wontonimo: nope <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing</a>
 PringleOrange: oh
 PringleOrange: yeah that
 Wontonimo: it is a bot battle, aka Multi
 PringleOrange: yeah 
 PringleOrange: what would i do for it?
 PringleOrange: like, how would i beat the boss
 Wontonimo: turn right
 Wontonimo: unless that won't win, then try left
 Wontonimo: but seriously though, you'll have to keep track of the board in your code and make sure your bot doesn't run into a wall or line
 PringleOrange: ah so is x1 and y1 the square ahead of me?
 Wontonimo: i don't remember.  i'm not looking at that code atm
 Wontonimo: all the info in the scrollable panel to the left
 Blokops: what was the name of the bot in the chat
 Wontonimo: Automaton2000 do you have another name?
 Automaton2000: but you can't do it
 Blokops: Automaton2000 where did the last slice of pitza go
 Automaton2000: now how do i change it to move to a cell that you have already won
 Wontonimo: If you'd like to know how automaton works, take a look this puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7799355410921bf449a7b4ecbbde9186ff2c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7799355410921bf449a7b4ecbbde9186ff2c</a>

 Wontonimo: ^^ pseudo code for the random seed
 Blokops: for some reason test 3 should be "is good" but is giving me "bad"
 Blokops: oh the random seed needs to run even if there 1 option got it
 Wontonimo: nice feedback
 Wontonimo: thanks Blokops
 Blokops: :ok_hand:
 Wontonimo: the section about reproducability already mentions the 1 option
 Wontonimo: ...for 'randomly' picking from options for the next state even if there only exists 1 options.
 Wontonimo: cool.  so now you can make your own Automaton2000 Blokops&#160;!  ;)
 Automaton2000: that will help me understand how to do a project for uni
 Blokops: funny he says that right now im on that topic in uni 
 Wontonimo: cool, what are you takiing in uni Blokops?
 Blokops: Language processing 
 Wontonimo: like compilers or like machine learning?
 Blokops: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Blokops: my bet is machine lerning but is too soon to say
 Blokops: but thanks to you puzzle i might just skiped at least a week of class
 Wontonimo: are you processing human language, like stories and customer complaints, or is the course about how to write somethihng to compile new programming languages?
 Wontonimo: sounds like NLP (natural language processing)
 Blokops: is SLP
 Blokops: i dont know what S stands for
 Wontonimo: maybe this&#160;:Speech-language pathologists (SLP) study and treat speech, language, and communication disorders
 Blokops: i think it mgiht be both
 Wontonimo: maybe "Spoken Language Processing"
 Blokops: it says "topics in language processing"
 Wontonimo: cool
 Blokops: oh spoken would be so fun

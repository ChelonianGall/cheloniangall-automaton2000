 Gorbit99: whenever I see that, I just take a ruby array, fill that up instead and join it with a space
 LelouchVC2: Idk how to make my message directed to a specific person xD
 AntiSquid: nah it's cool, much better than my personal site
 AntiSquid: (i don't have one)
 mpt: Took me days to do the Nintendo challenge. Very hard indeed...
 yashjain27: hye guys
 yashjain27: im new to this 
 yashjain27: i got a google interview question
 yashjain27: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-such-that-no-two-elements-are-adjacent/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-such-that-no-two-elements-are-adjacent/</a> 
 yashjain27: i felt that this was wayyy too hard for an interview question. any thoughts? 
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: pls respond
 Automaton2000: i need to read it
 Uljahn: ok
 KiwiTae: yashjain27 not too hard to be honest 
 fvla: this is easily solvable using dynamic programming
 OrdoFlammae: I'm having a lot of trouble with the Ghost in the Cell puzzle, where the input for 'entityCount' is always zero. I'm not sure why this is. I'm using Clojure, but I don't think the language should affect anything.
 fvla: if you haven't made significant changes, then restore default code
 LelouchVC2: These clashes get so retarded
 LelouchVC2: I'm sitting here with working code having to make like 10 conditions for spacing because the tests can't deal with it
 LelouchVC2: If there's an extra space at the end, the tests shouldn't freak out!
 fvla: clash honestly isn't worth it, puzzles and multiplayer are much better
 fvla: and again, if you want to do clash, learn python, because you can't golf, be quicker, or print easily (as you've seen)
 Automaton2000: so my bot is doing better than me
 fvla: by the way Automaton2000, are you the creator of the titular SC2 micro stuff?
 Automaton2000: im not saying it is possible to use a different language
 Gorbit99: I enjoy clash more than multiplayer tbh
 Gorbit99: and python is not the best at golf
 fvla: what about single player puzzles?
 fvla: c++ is worse
 fvla: at golf
 Gorbit99: sure, and C# is even worse
 fvla: and perl is suffering
 Gorbit99: I personally prefer ruby
 Gorbit99: quick, extensive std lib, and short as hell
 fvla: i'm saying this to LelouchVC2, who uses C++
 Gorbit99: ah
 fvla: maybe i should learn ruby some time
 Gorbit99: if you use modern C++, you can get reasonable times at "fastest" and therefore reverse
 fvla: but i like python for its libraries and support
 fvla: for fast prototyping
 Gorbit99: ruby can do what python can in code size
 fvla: in modern c++, it's hard to print "2 3 4" instead of "2 3 4 "
 Gorbit99: that's a reasonably hard thing in most languages, unless you can just join an array
 yashjain27: guys im new to this website
 yashjain27: where do i begin to improve my algorithms?
 yashjain27: clash of code?
 yashjain27: or is there something else thats a bit more challenging?
 Gorbit99: in the practice menu
 Gorbit99: clash of code is challenging, but in a different way
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>that's the challenging part
 yashjain27: so many games
 yashjain27: which one do i choose?
 yashjain27: nvm dumb question
 yashjain27: im not interested in AI 
 yashjain27: i want to practice algorithms'
 Gorbit99: Practice section
 LelouchVC2: To print out "2 3 4" instead of "2 3 4 "
 Gorbit99: well, a bool and a for loop
 LelouchVC2: I usually use the condition where if the counter+1 is equal to the number we're looping to, then it doesn't output the space
 Gorbit99: or that
 fvla: gorbit, print(*my_list) is not hard
 LelouchVC2: But I was doing a loop where it only outputs from numbers 
 LelouchVC2: So it took a lot more conditions
 Gorbit99: puts my_list*" "
 Gorbit99: that's ruby
 fvla: just not "reasonably hard" in scripting languages
 Gorbit99: well, when I said, "hoining an array", I meant anything close to pumping all your values into an array and printing that
 LelouchVC2: You can do that in c++, but separating values with spaces will be hard
 LelouchVC2: I suppose you can make it so the space comes first
 LelouchVC2: Then you simply output the string without the first character
 LelouchVC2: But it's such a messy way to do it
 fvla: that's awful in terms of memory
 fvla: there's no reason to build a buffer and then pump it into a stream just to discard
 fvla: disgusting in c++ terms
 fvla: but who the hell cares about efficiency in clash
 fvla: just do puzzles and multiplayer...
 Gorbit99: with ranged loops, the cleanest way is something like having a bool to signal if you need spaces
 LelouchVC2: Yea, any good solution would take too long to implement and think about for a clash
 Gorbit99: I don't understand the hate towards coc
 Gorbit99: bool space = false
 LelouchVC2: A lot of the prompts are trash, and a lot of the coders are python and ruby
 LelouchVC2: and java
 LelouchVC2: It's amazing I got to this rank coding only in C++
 Gorbit99: eh, some prompts are trash
 Gorbit99: but most are fine
 Gorbit99: and there's a reason most coders use scripting languages
 Gorbit99: I can't even use ruby properly, except if I need to write shit code
 LelouchVC2: ruby can be used for something other than shit code?
 fvla: yes
 fvla: ~~but perl can't~~
 fvla: strikethrough doesn't work...
 Gorbit99: it's very popular among vim users for some reason
 Gorbit99: as I've found out
 fvla: f*** vim
 Gorbit99: you got some strong opinions
 fvla: sorry, tourette's /s
 Gorbit99: I did aoc2019 in ruby and it was fine
 fvla: vim's so cramped
 Gorbit99: the fact that it has a fast hashmap is a godsentd
 Gorbit99: I'm quite fine with vim
 fvla: lots of people are
 Gorbit99: cramped? elaborate please
 fvla: modal makes it so that if you make one slip-up in your keystrokes, you can really mess up something
 fvla: i spend more time figuring out whether to use o or O than actually typing
 Gorbit99: ok, then you do Esc+u, and you'll undo your issue
 fvla: esc is a horrible design too
 fvla: there's stuff like binding to jj or jk...
 Gorbit99: Ctrl+C also works somewhat
 fvla: it's a personal thing, really
 Gorbit99: brb, coc
 Gorbit99: most editors are a personal thing
 Gorbit99: I can't stand vsc for example
 fvla: so why vim, not emacs or notepad++?
 fvla: i use emacs mostly for macros, notepad++ for editing
 Gorbit99: emacs is cool and all, but I want an editor, not an os
 fvla: you use only what you need
 fvla: "emacs is an os" is a misconception
 Gorbit99: and vim is much more extendable and personalizable than n++
 fvla: emacs has actually comprehensible scripts unlike vim
 Gorbit99: I'm also not a fan of lisp
 fvla: jjjo3745454k&lt;esc&gt;io&lt;esc&gt;
 Gorbit99: that's a lot of ups
 fvla: ups?
 Gorbit99: 3745454k
 Gorbit99: that's go up 3745454
 Gorbit99: times
 fvla: no, but there's an o before
 fvla: sike
 Gorbit99: oh right
 fvla: see, this is how horrible vim scripts are
 fvla: right, going in and out of insert/replace mode slows me down
 Gorbit99: ngl, never written any longer than a few chars
 fvla: and for the life of me, i can't remember the exact mechanics of dw
 fvla: does it delete forward or back
 Gorbit99: forwards
 fvla: and does it delete leading/trailing spaces, punctuation, etc.
 Gorbit99: diw is better
 fvla: wtf is that
 fvla: diw
 Gorbit99: w only includes all letters
 Gorbit99: diw is delete in word
 Gorbit99: because let's say you have this:
 Gorbit99: abc|defg
 Gorbit99: | is your cursor
 Gorbit99: dw deletes only defg
 Gorbit99: diw deletes the whole word
 Gorbit99: diW would include all non whitespace characters into the word
 Gorbit99: so abcd-efgh would be 2 separate words, but one WORD
 fvla: this is horrifying
 Gorbit99: and daw and daW include the whitespace around the words
 fvla: having to know all this
 Gorbit99: it's muscle memory
 fvla: to learn how to delete a word from every possible angle
 Gorbit99: I mean
 fvla: emacs has M-f M-backspace
 Gorbit99: it's mostly either diw or diW
 fvla: hm
 fvla: so, how do i delete a single character
 Gorbit99: x
 fvla: in vim
 fvla: okay
 Gorbit99: if you want to delete and go into insert mode, you do s
 Gorbit99: and if you want to replace only that character, and nothing else, then r
 fvla: vim is chock full of landmines
 Gorbit99: not really
 fvla: accidental o, O, x, d, s presses
 Gorbit99: then you do Esc+u, and you're back without an issue
 fvla: i like my cursor location and command outputs to be predictable so that i can edit without fear
 Gorbit99: it is predictable
 fvla: i guess vim can become predictable if you memorize each thing
 Gorbit99: you don't memorize a single thing
 Gorbit99: tell me, did you memorize, that your i key was the 8th key in the top row?
 Gorbit99: same thing
 fvla: &lt;esc&gt;dwi is the most unintuitive way i have ever seen to forward-delete a word and continue editing
 Gorbit99: you don't really think about it
 Gorbit99: you can just do cw
 Gorbit99: change word
 Gorbit99: ciw changes the entire word
 fvla: modal esc is the biggest killer for me
 fvla: i can't &lt;esc&gt;cw as fast as i can alt-d or ctrl-delete
 Gorbit99: then use CtrlC
 Gorbit99: it's technically not the same, but mostly it is
 fvla: that's horrifying
 fvla: "technically not the same, but mostly it is"
 fvla: if i ever want to use that, now i'm going to have to look up documentation first
 Gorbit99: it won't expand an abbreviation if you're doing one
 Gorbit99: that's the difference
 fvla: expand...?
 Gorbit99: you can define abbreviations
 Gorbit99: like "if I type email, expand it to example@example.com"
 Gorbit99: if you type email, and press Esc, it will be expanded
 Gorbit99: with Ctrl+C it won'tr

 Kazamisa: Hello
 Kazamisa: Anyone knows how the codinpoints of clash of codes and the ranking is calculated&#160;?
 Gorbit99: you can click on your placement in the main clash of codes page to view the full ranking
 Gorbit99: there's an elo system basically
 Gorbit99: and seems like codinpoints are proportional to your placement
 LelouchVC2: The more clashes I do the higher my rank goes
 LelouchVC2: I guess I win a lot of them
 Gorbit99: coc is a weird thing
 Gorbit99: I get like 0.01 points for a first place
 Gorbit99: and lose 0.2 for a second place
 Kazamisa: I see
 Kazamisa: thanks
 Uljahn: go to the home page and click the question mark on the rank frame
 Kazamisa: Thanks it's explained in details there
 Kazamisa: It should be obvious to check the question mark should've thought about it x))
 LelouchVC2: Probably won't get much past 9000th rank without python
 LelouchVC2: complex prompt, 283 characters in  C++ and 77 characters in python
 Aka_nate458: Hey guys
 DaanBreur: hello&#160;;)
 DaanBreur: hello
 PetrutV: wow, the platform doesn't let me use inline conditionals in c# wtf 
 PetrutV: how else should I get less code for clashes if I can't use all tricks in the language lol
 BeardedWhale: Are you sure PetrutV? That sounds very weird.
 PetrutV: Yeah, it popped an error when I used an inline conditional
 wlesavo: &gt;dont play coc&gt;no code&gt;profit
 PetrutV: xDDD
 fasil: hooi
 Illedan: PetrutV  should be possible..
 BeardedWhale: Yeah PetrutV, I tried now and it works for me

 eulerscheZahl: bad idea wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: maybe if you only take odd numbers? or non-primes?
 wlesavo: i actually got my first coc invite recently
 struct: We need to riot to prevent this
 mark7: my conding game reverse engineering puzzle shows 400 points in results page put shows best score of 82 why?

 wlesavo: questionmark
 eulerscheZahl: i would expect that kind of pun with the name from MadKnight
 eulerscheZahl: but yours is more funny
 struct: 8500 registered 
 struct: damn
 struct: I think the one closest to this one was The Accountant
 eulerscheZahl: let's see how many will actually play
 struct: The accountat was 9k registered iirc
 struct: or maybe im mistaken
 struct: I cant remember&#160;:/
 wlesavo: what was the relation registered vs submitted for ooc?
 eulerscheZahl: less than one third submitted
 eulerscheZahl: but 97% opened the IDE at least
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand: OOC was announced very shortly
 eulerscheZahl: so it was almost impossible to register before the contest started
 struct: ok the acountant was 7k registered my bad
 struct: "4500 submits"
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, "submits"
 eulerscheZahl: i'm there too. i had a short look at the rules in the IDE but never submitted
 eulerscheZahl: forced submit by CG in the end as i clicked "play my code"
 struct: I see
 struct: ooc was 7.2k registered
 struct: 2279 submits
 [CG]Thibaud: ooc had a very low start to submit conversion around 30% while we usually are more between 40% and 50%
 anid: Why does it happen? Doesnt the contest run long enough for players to at least get some rudimentary work in?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the complicated rules scared some users?
 Illedan: ooc had a big threshold to get started I guess.And a lot of players had time to check it out
 [CG]Thibaud: a lot of players get demotivated, were only curious or don't have the time
 [CG]Thibaud: some even code and play against the boss but don't feel confident to submit
 anid: Makes sense, people may only submit after beating the boss a few times
 [CG]Thibaud: possibly
 wlesavo: do you expect that conversion rate would be higher for spring contest?
 [CG]Thibaud: yes. We've added a few things to help people get started
 [CG]Thibaud: bot programming tuto,getting started video,nice pictures in statement for the rules
 eulerscheZahl: a new video which we don't know yet?
 inoryy: [CG]Thibaud do you track registered vs ran non-default code?
 cegprakash: anid I submit if my code compiles
 cegprakash: I like this idea of showing the notification under "compete" tab even and remains there 
 cegprakash: I hope it remains there for the next 11 days..
 cegprakash: forces everyone into the contest :D
 cegprakash: also according to minimax, algorithm 8500 will submit their solutions.
 struct: What do you mean?
 struct: 8500 will submit?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even surprised that ceg has a buggy minimax implementation
 struct: 8549 registered
 struct: I really doubt even 70% submits
 struct: even 50% is a stretch imo
 eulerscheZahl: 3k players in a contest would be a surprise to me. i don't know if there has been more advertising outside of CG than usually
 struct: I used google and did not find much
 [CG]Thibaud: there has been eulerscheZahl
 [CG]Thibaud: no inoryy
 Quidome: I am in&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i know: GitC and CotClong ago but great games
 [CG]Thibaud: new video eulerscheZahl but 2-3mns to help newcomers to get in
 Quidome: And exited, only 24 hours left...
 Quidome: I am amazed how big this is already BTW
 Quidome: Competition is tough as well
 [CG]Thibaud: we've done more promotion than usual, but I wish I've had time to do more
 eulerscheZahl: we'll soon see if it helped
 struct: Time to update avatars
 struct: I already did mine
 [CG]Thibaud: nice one
 eulerscheZahl: well done ruct

 Rprades: is code of kutulu bugged? Once a wanderer points at me, it will never return the last wanderer even tho it is withing entity_count
 Rprades: has anyone faced this on python?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you print the input to error?do you flush your error stream?
 eulerscheZahl: print(..., flush=True)
 Rprades: nono, it gives time out, and it reaches to the previous line before the "input" statement, and it never reaches the following line, without any error traceback. It just keeps waiting for an input that never comes
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm telling you that you probably get the input and jut don't see it because you don't flush your error stream. and the timeout is somewhere below in your code

 AntiSquid: finding the stream link is part of the viewing experience
 eulerscheZahl: when did you reach lvl48?
 AntiSquid: cegprakash you should post your link on discord
 eulerscheZahl: this time he's even understandable. no loud music or laptop fan
 AntiSquid: today
 mark7: Will the referee of spring challenge will be published? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 mark7: as contest starts right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: cegprakash that information is not relevant
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe even starter codes that help you parse the input and create some game objects
 eulerscheZahl: that happens sometimes for common languages but not always
 AntiSquid: as long as the referee won't be like UTG
 AntiSquid: all good
 eulerscheZahl: so functional
 mark7: UTG?
 eulerscheZahl: unleash the greek
 AntiSquid: crystal rush multi 
 mark7: Okay!
 AntiSquid: wonder what kind of contract forced them to change its name :D
 Astrobytes: Most likely just some IP clause in the contract
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash you take the color of the last stone in a group of 8 given in the input
 eulerscheZahl: also: there's a debug view for STC? i played that for months without noticing
 eulerscheZahl: ceg you get a high score for chainsand only skulls touching with your group get removed
 eulerscheZahl: and you ran out of space, you can't place 2 green there
 struct: Hard to go for in stc without sim imo
 Astrobytes: :D
 cegprakash: "You may append text to your instructions, it will be displayed in the viewer."
 AntiSquid: minuscule IDE
 AntiSquid: ya euler read the statement
 eulerscheZahl: i mean the debug view showing numbers along with the stones
 Astrobytes: lol cegprakash
 eulerscheZahl: shift the top row by 1
 eulerscheZahl: or simulate the whole thing and bruteforce it. that's who gold and legend bots play the game
 eulerscheZahl: groceries.cpp?is that how he writes his shopping list? :P
 AntiSquid: well he is doing it by hand&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: cegprakash just do random search
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo for the win
 mark7: I created a chess engine with minimax with alpha beta.It always plays badly as 2nd player (white or black) any ideas on this
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: Do you have opening book&#160;?
 mark7: I use lichess api
 mark7: sort of plays perfetly for first 25 moves&#160;:-)  
 eulerscheZahl: i don't believe a single word!
 mark7: Why?
 eulerscheZahl: perfect game on chess?
 mark7: Okay, lets say like a grand master
 jacek: opening book eh
 eulerscheZahl: the game isn't sufficiently explored to even tell what a perfect move is
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even know if one player can force a win
 mark7: there is no possibility of calculating 130 million position
 jacek: i think he meant he uses lichess for opening moves
 eulerscheZahl: it's much more
 eulerscheZahl: like 10^100 i think
 mark7: Ya I forget exact number
 jacek: which were calculated as pretty decent
 mark7: 10^130
 mark7: ya
 LoGos: more than milion i think
 eulerscheZahl: 130 million is totally doable
 jacek: is 10^120
 eulerscheZahl: no
 mark7: my laptop crying in fire..
 mark7: there is a numberphile video on that
 LelouchVC2: pedophile
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number</a>
 Astrobytes: A numberphile video about  burning laptops?
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number</a>
 jacek: too slow
 mark7: ... IE8
 mark7: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: and the toad number = 10^100 is a conservative estimation of the shannon number
 Astrobytes: Good save euler
 eulerscheZahl: IE8? I highly recommend to update for security reasons
 Astrobytes: For all reasons
 eulerscheZahl: update to firefox or chromium
 eulerscheZahl: and don't install it on your windows XP
 jacek: does CG work on ie8?
 mark7: Just kidding I use pop_OS
 mark7: ans use firefox as browser 
 mark7: and*
 Astrobytes: That is a relief!
 eulerscheZahl: i tried epiphany at some point. refused to scroll on the multiplayer overview page
 Farma12: stupid question: can I import moduls like sympy in python somehow which are not present at the online editor?

 Astrobytes: DAmn you euler
 eulerscheZahl: if it's offered in autocompletion is another story
 eulerscheZahl: still no .net core
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm scared of such a change directly before the contest
 mark7: Do you guys use any ml algorithms for bot programming? f
 Farma12: @eulerscheZahl thank you
 Astrobytes: lol, push before holiday is always a great idea
 eulerscheZahl: some do. e.g. the top at coders strike back

 mark7: not so great idea*
 Astrobytes: forgot the /s :P
 mark7: :joy:
 mark7: eulerscheZahl how do you include the trained model file?
 eulerscheZahl: did you read the article that i linked?
 AntiSquid: but it contains words

 mark7: Passing the 100ko code size limit
 mark7: okay sorry
 AntiSquid: you can just copy your weights to your normal code and feedforward
 Astrobytes: How are your ML experiments coming along AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: or just do linear regression on 10 different parameters lol
 AntiSquid: i didn't do anything new Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 AntiSquid: also for a 1 week contest i wouldn't bother i think
 eulerscheZahl: it's 11 days
 Astrobytes: Seems more applicable to multis until you have a working framework I guess
 eulerscheZahl: still 1 more than usual
 AntiSquid: was working from home so it's not like i had extra free time 
 eulerscheZahl: cooking from home?
 AntiSquid: sure
 LelouchVC2: I cook on the sidewalk during the summer
 eulerscheZahl: and customers knocking on your door?
 LelouchVC2: Cement hot enough to cook eggs
 Astrobytes: You still don't know eulerscheZahl?
 AntiSquid: no it's laced with corona, so they don't 
 eulerscheZahl: he got a new job?
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: really? what is it?
 eulerscheZahl: also congrats of course
 AntiSquid: lol thanks, but nothing special
 eulerscheZahl: a coding job?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i wasn't around when this information was spread
 AntiSquid: software support role basically
 eulerscheZahl: have you tried turning it off and on again?
 mark7: it always works :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: 0118999881999119725 3
 Astrobytes: lo
 Astrobytes: l
 Astrobytes: Still funny to this day
 AntiSquid: there's actually an internal IT support number and it's used for lots of other non-IT related issues too 
 Astrobytes: How.... useful
 AntiSquid: so people only need to remember the 1 number
 eulerscheZahl: the coffee machine is empty!
 AntiSquid: you have a "housekeeper" role for that i think
 eulerscheZahl: install some CG benching tool on each of the PCs
 eulerscheZahl: and then do offline param fitting with it
 AntiSquid: lots of THIN clients
 eulerscheZahl: but lots
 mark7: today once again codeforces round became unrated
 eulerscheZahl: they even delayed it to avoid that
 eulerscheZahl: slow submits as they feared?
 mark7: Ya!
 mark7: # days
 AntiSquid: what does that mean?
 mark7: 3*
 AntiSquid: unrated
 eulerscheZahl: not affecting your ranking
 eulerscheZahl: "UPD Unfortunately due to the long queue and other issues, the contest is unrated. "
 Astrobytes: Temporary?
 mark7: Na
 Astrobytes: ffs, that's a bit crappy
 mark7: Your rating wont get affected by your contest resu;t
 mark7: result
 mark7: They are looking upto problem
 eulerscheZahl: that's a really rare thing on codeforces
 mark7: Some database stuff..
 eulerscheZahl: saw it happen before when an expected solution was clearly wrong
 mark7: :joy:
 Astrobytes: lol
 mark7: It's more like do you know about this maths fact..
 eulerscheZahl: but the fact in that case was not a fact
 eulerscheZahl: just an assumption by the author which proved to be wrong
 Astrobytes: Post-truth contest
 mark7: Haha
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i'm playing the codechef may challenge
 eulerscheZahl: but won't be able to finish it before the CG contest&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: The one you were exceeding the time limit on? Did you fix it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 mark7: long challenge are great harder problem more time..
 eulerscheZahl: was some bit wizardy
 eulerscheZahl: i thought i could tread it as int[] with the single bits
 eulerscheZahl: and to do actual bit operations
 eulerscheZahl: and then a weird overflow happened
 eulerscheZahl: so i converted to python
 mark7: bitset?
 eulerscheZahl: then got timelimit exceeded again
 eulerscheZahl: then optimized a bit more
 Astrobytes: Your Python was faster than your C++, nice
 eulerscheZahl: no but time limit for C++: 1s
 eulerscheZahl: python: 5s
 Astrobytes: Haha I see
 eulerscheZahl: and my improved C++ took 90ms while python was close to the 5s when i passed
 mark7: My current mars lander code sets the destination at x + 500 middle of flat surface reducing or increasing doesn;'t seem to work..
 eulerscheZahl: my mars lander crashes into a mountain
 mark7: But I see you at top 50
 mark7: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: if i submit often enough, i pass

 mark7: this is my get angle code this doesnt seem to work..
 eulerscheZahl: you get the angle as a separate input
 eulerscheZahl: and you can modify it on your own, it's not directly correlated to your movement direction
 eulerscheZahl: more to the change of speed
 mark7: But I am calculating the angle required to get to destination. Some simple trigo but not working
 Astrobytes: ARe you calculating to degrees instead of radians
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457759961">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457759961</a>
 mark7: Yes
 mark7: Then converting to radains
 Astrobytes:  convert to radainsalpha = alpha * 180 / Math.PI;
 mark7:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: That's converting to degrees no?
 eulerscheZahl: that looks like Java to me
 eulerscheZahl: there is Math.toRadians and Math.toDegrees i think
 mark7: Let me check
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457760894">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457760894</a> some progress

 eulerscheZahl: know your language library, sometimes there are some pleasant surprises waiting for you to be discovered
 mark7: to Radians worked. Now just calculate current curAngle - desiredAngle
 mark7: or reverse..
 Astrobytes: Your conversion formula was wrong btw, for future reference
 eulerscheZahl: oh damn. i opened the replay and somehow the sound activated itself again
 mark7: Yess I checked
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 mark7: bhooom :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of that nonsense demo contribution i made <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/826998f668b6e336606698b7eda1fbf760907a">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/826998f668b6e336606698b7eda1fbf760907a</a>
 Astrobytes: Space Invaders? No, what's that from
 eulerscheZahl: pacman death
 Astrobytes: Aha ofc
 Astrobytes: How appropriate
 AntiSquid: maybe we get lode runner instead
 eulerscheZahl: i just copied juliens sound example using that one
 eulerscheZahl: and added a toggle to it
 AntiSquid: too many atari games
 eulerscheZahl: not having a pacman contest would be a surprise now :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that was for that contribution that the author never released
 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the pumpkin maze
 Astrobytes: That looked really good
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a shame that he didn't finish it
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the toroidal map was cool too
 Astrobytes: Great retro-looking gfx too
 eulerscheZahl: ceg has a cat :D
 eulerscheZahl: ran out of the screen right now
 Astrobytes: lol awesome
 eulerscheZahl: chasing it
 Astrobytes: Oh, it ran in from the outside
 eulerscheZahl: seems like that
 Astrobytes: He just said
 eulerscheZahl: heard it
 jacek: aww
 Astrobytes: Btw euler, what is your cat's name? Just out of curiosity
 mark7: yay: working <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457763636">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457763636</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Kittynot very original, kept the name she got from the shelter
 Astrobytes: gj mark7
 mark7: gj?
 Astrobytes: Ah right, yeah I had a friend who called his Cat. More common than you think :D
 Astrobytes: Good job mark7

 mark7: Astrobytes Thanks 
 eulerscheZahl: you can see my old PC in the background. got a new one in 2011 i think. that pic is old
 Astrobytes: np mark7
 Astrobytes: Aww she's lovely
 eulerscheZahl: until she spends a night with you
 eulerscheZahl: she has her own door to go in and out
 Astrobytes: Oh try having two.
 eulerscheZahl: but she decides to annoy me until i go and open the front door for her
 eulerscheZahl: she really hates other cats
 eulerscheZahl: you have 2 iirc
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's cats for you
 Astrobytes: My eldest hates the youngest.
 Astrobytes: Jealousy.
 eulerscheZahl: the neighbor's cat regularly visits me
 eulerscheZahl: eating her food
 eulerscheZahl: he totally ignores her, doesn't care
 eulerscheZahl: but she hates him
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: it's really annoying when he gets inside in the middle of the night and enters my room after he ate all food
 Astrobytes: My neighbour's cat used to come in and eat my cats food when the back door was open.
 Astrobytes: (My cats are scared to go out unless I'm with them - don't ask me why)
 eulerscheZahl: yes ceg i hear some music
 eulerscheZahl: my cat goes outside alone as well. but she prefers when i go along with her
 eulerscheZahl: about to go for a walk with her now. reduces the risk of her catching a mouse in the middle of the night
 Astrobytes: Haha, one of my previous cats was terrible for bringing home half-dead "gifts"

 Astrobytes: Not sure I can watch 2 streams live, chat and play 2048 at the same time
 mark7: 2048 is much like thumb practice
 mark7: keep swiping
 Astrobytes: Playing on PC, finger practice&#160;;)
 mark7: *Sometimes you do need to think
 mark7: Then you gotta have huge monitor
 Astrobytes: 2 x 19"
 eulerscheZahl: 1 x 27", 2560x1440
 LoGos: In Mars Lander, if I store position/velocity as floats do I have to round them every turn?
 BenjaminUrquhart: the referee rounds them iinternally irc
 BenjaminUrquhart: internally*
 eulerscheZahl: no!
 eulerscheZahl: only for output
 Uljahn: ^
 BenjaminUrquhart: k I'm wrong as usual
 eulerscheZahl: so don't trust the referee and compute your own values

 eulerscheZahl: took me a bit of experimenting with LibreOffice to get that
 LoGos: thanks eulerscheZahl!
 freud: does the "get a job" tab work? i can't seem to save my address
 Astrobytes: LibreOffice, I had to give up on that
 Astrobytes: No idea freud
 CRyo: hey,has anyone done ASCII Art in C#?
 CRyo: all my test cases work but i'm failing one case when i submit. Not sure if it's an optimization or logic problem

 BenjaminUrquhart: well
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: but
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: actually
 BenjaminUrquhart: no

 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 Andrew9mb: Does anyone know why I'm getting "Unhandled Exception: System.FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format."?
 Andrew9mb: Seems to be codingame specific.
 Quidome: which language are you using?
 eulerscheZahl: looks like C# to me
 Andrew9mb: It's gone now. No idea what happened. It was C#
 eulerscheZahl: and seems like a runtime exception from your language, not CGs fault
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you tried to parse something to an int or something like that. but it was not a number
 macmv: Why can't I define a map in ruby like this? {a: 1, b: 2}
 macmv: It just gives me syntax errors
 Quidome: euler where can i find the naab replay on bender 4
 eulerscheZahl: you can't, he shared that on the chat when the game was still new
 Quidome: a pitty
 eulerscheZahl: as a bug report. game crashed when viewer ran out of space
 Quidome: nice&#160;:)
 Quidome: Interesting i am getting exact same stepcount as others
 Quidome: Using the same strategy probably
 eulerscheZahl: 4886?
 Quidome: That first but now 3197
 MadKnight: struct
 Quidome: 4886, is clear of course
 eulerscheZahl: 4886 is the optimal solution when ignoring functions and garbage balls
 bruhhhh: i am tired
 struct: yes?
 MadKnight: did u pm snef here&#160;?
 MadKnight: he's online
 bruhhhh: it is 3 am now ere
 bruhhhh: here
 Astrobytes: BFS for Bender 4?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MadKnight: just go to sleep bruhhhh
 Astrobytes: Must get around to that
 Quidome: sweet dreams :P
 eulerscheZahl: that's how i generated the maps and made sure there is no trivial solution
 Astrobytes: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: 3D state: x,y, togglestate (binary encoding)
 Quidome: binary encoding was needed in my case
 eulerscheZahl: that's also how i coded it when making sure that everything is solvable
 Astrobytes: I hardly ever bfs without using some kind of binary encoding these days unless it's very trivial
 eulerscheZahl: generated random maps. then tried to solve, some were impossible
 eulerscheZahl: so i dumped them
 eulerscheZahl: i ran the script about half an hour to generate enough maps
 Quidome: nice work
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: Your Space Maze one still scares me 
 eulerscheZahl: my part 2 scares me as well

 AntiSquid: "if your goals don't scare you they aren't big enough"
 Astrobytes: Oh that never got accepted right
 eulerscheZahl: and i won't publish it without having a solution to all testcases myself
 eulerscheZahl: timeout on testcase 2 at the moment
 Astrobytes: Ofc, no point if it's unsolvable lol
 Astrobytes: Good quote AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: you could do it backwards, start from solved state and then move stuff / add blocks until you scrambled up the game enough
 eulerscheZahl: my boss-boss has a calendar hanging in the office, with inspirational quotes
 Quidome: wow spaces maze is only solved by 3  persons
 Astrobytes: Everywhere I've worked we used to write them on either a big whiteboard or chalkboard
 eulerscheZahl: now as most of us are working from home because of covid19, he sends a photo of the daily quote each day
 Astrobytes: lol, dedication
 eulerscheZahl: the calender being printed last year of course. so there are quotes like "if you sacrifice freedom for safety, you don't deserve either of both"
 AntiSquid: you can add to spam :o
 Astrobytes: haha, epic example quote for current times
 eulerscheZahl: there have been a few funny quotes in the context of working from home
 Astrobytes: Perhaps home-working attitudes will shift now, who knows
 AntiSquid: some stuff could just be done from home
 AntiSquid: and some meetings should be emails
 Astrobytes: I've always done VOIP stuff, Skype, etc for remote meetings, works great
 AntiSquid: the office world is extremely lazy compared to the catering world
 eulerscheZahl: i prefer that too
 Astrobytes: Yes AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: do you have to take stairs on customer support? :scream:
 AntiSquid: it's not customer support
 eulerscheZahl: internal tech support
 AntiSquid: well sort of is and isn't
 AntiSquid: random mixed duties of all kinds, related to software they use and other such stuff
 inoryy: I actually really really miss working in the office; hate working from home
 AntiSquid: really? lol
 eulerscheZahl: i miss the clear border between personal and company time
 eulerscheZahl: i have 2 different computers which helps a bit
 AntiSquid: i find the frontline staff alright to work with, but the office env is boring as hell
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, When I was at hospital today, dude at the desk called a colleague in to help him find my info - he put the wrong birth year info in. 10 minutes wasted
 inoryy: I worked remotely for almost 5 years before that so it's not novel to me which is probably part of the reason so many like it
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes ya those people exist
 Astrobytes: For my pharma stuff I usually work remotely, some office stuff required but not much
 AntiSquid: some of the stuff i do is to fix mistakes those kinda folks make on the system Astrobytes 
 Astrobytes: I don't envy you AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: lol who would

 cegprakash: but fast songs I like 5 in 10 songs
 Astrobytes: Awesome, I've been to some concerts with friends but was mostly Behari and some Gujurati stuff
 cegprakash: Punjabi songs are good to dance
 cegprakash: but their music is the same for every song
 Astrobytes: Yesss, great dancing rhythm!
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 Astrobytes: Very recognisable

 reCurse: Did I miss russian drama
 MadKnight: really old ones
 yassineH: you guys are weirdly awesome...
 AntiSquid: i know MadKnight, when i get mad at you i just go smash a plate and order a new one, but Cyberpunk was taking it personally
 MadKnight: nothing recent
 MadKnight: then just don't get mad at me AntiSquid ezpz
 MadKnight: mostly it was inory trying to explain stuff to cyberpunk but failing over and over
 yassineH: btw, how do you prepare for a contest when you all are this well ranked and experienced and stuff
 AntiSquid: i only the do the last bit "and stuff", works every time

 BenjaminUrquhart: I have issues reaching gold most of the time
 yassineH: i am 4k.. so for me you are much much better ranked hhh
 yassineH: you probably dont give it enough time
 BenjaminUrquhart: mmm
 AntiSquid: so much rank stroking, Automaton2000 do something
 Automaton2000: i don't see why it would be hard to beat
 AntiSquid: good answer (considering both meanings)

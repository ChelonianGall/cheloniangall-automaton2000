 Sineofxisx: kinda weird
 RyanGilbert: no offense @BattleRobot_c964 i know ur a bot
 Sineofxisx: :flushed:
 diegatzo: HELLO
 ChampionCoder: I just played against ALL the CoC bots and won against all of them except AkhilJohn and LannertvSeveir&#160;:(
 NotSpice: Does anyone know how optimization puzzles affect ranking?
 ChampionCoder: Go to your profile, and click on the ranking, on the right of your XP
 ChampionCoder: Scroll down, and have a look
 NotSpice: I found it, thanks!
 ChampionCoder:&#160;:+1:
 RyanGilbert: AkhilJohn is pro
 eulerscheZahl: AkhilJohn is a bot
 eulerscheZahl: I almost forgot:Happy Caturday
 jrke: oh me too happy caturday
 RyanGilbert: he is pro
 RyanGilbert: he non stop grinds
 struct: because its a bot
 RyanGilbert: no 
 RyanGilbert: he is pro
 struct: ...
 struct: ok
 RyanGilbert: its a joke
 Salted: ha! it's funny
 RyanGilbert: thanks
 Salted: they've played tens of thousands of games 
 Vigasaurus: yeah imagine dedicating their entire life to this 
 eulerscheZahl: and still being that bad at it
 Vigasaurus: I will say, I kinda wish this didn't use captcha
 Vigasaurus: I get one literally every time
 RyanGilbert: maybe you are the bot
 Vigasaurus: maybe
 jacek: happy Caturday
 ChampionCoder: Yeah BitWolf, Natchood, SuperMuppet, Tychkorg, all of them are bits
 ChampionCoder: 'Tis given in their bioo

 ArCjLord: hi guys
 proogrmr: yo
 AntiSquid: ChampionCoder there's a report functionality on the profile, report them for being bots, also report AutomatonNN, gotta purge them all
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN dead? Automaton2000
 AntiSquid: RIP
 AutomatonNN: ah no i don't know how to speed it to the problem
 AutomatonNN:  i need some help with coding today
 C_Boy: anyone else keep running out of time for the clashes?

 DoubleTaxidermistFromAfar_98b2: hi guys 
 jacek: good afternoon
 DoubleTaxidermistFromAfar_98b2: I couldn't understand  about these coding this lit bit different from others coding program
 jacek: hm?
 DoubleTaxidermistFromAfar_98b2: i mean methods
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: are you dead?
 Stilgart: no more turtles&#160;;(
 eddantess: hello everyone
 eddantess: im new here but i cant do anything&#160;:'D
 jacek: :o
 EmreUnlu: me either buddy 
 eddantess: turk musun emre
 EmreUnlu: evet
 AntiSquid: salami
 jacek: omelette du fromage
 AntiSquid: that's not turkish
 jacek: not really french either
 EmreUnlu: not rly lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Turkeys are not turkish either.
 EmreUnlu: some of them are 
 BlaiseEbuth: Immigrant ones&#160;?
 EmreUnlu: no the locals
 EmreUnlu: actually animal name "turkey" named after country " Turkey" by irish ppl
 EmreUnlu: just a fun fact 
 BlaiseEbuth: Very flattering...
 EmreUnlu: xD
 jacek: maybe they were hungary
 BlaiseEbuth: See that big chicken over there&#160;? We gonna name it "Turkey" and we gonna eat it once a year.
 BlaiseEbuth: If they had been english, probably the big chicken would have been named "France"... 
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 EmreUnlu: they named it like that bsc during the UK embargo over Ireland irish ppl starve to death  bcs lack of food but old Turkey (Ottoman Empire) exported them "turkeys" to help them then they named it after them.
 EmreUnlu: but it is funny to we have country name same as animal
 jacek: so it is form of gratitude
 EmreUnlu: i think they never seen that animal before and they were lazy and just named after it from our race
 EmreUnlu: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: "I like you. I will name this poultry after you."
 BlaiseEbuth: "race"&#160;:/
 EmreUnlu: "Thank you i wish next gen. are not going to make fun of our country name"
 eulerscheZahl: ok, let's make fun about Uruguay then

 JimenezLi: Hi everyone, do you know how to prove I am not a bot in Clash of Code?
 eulerscheZahl: there's a google reCaptcha
 BlaiseEbuth: Solve a captcha on a twitch live&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: which is blocked in China
 eulerscheZahl: get a VPN or wait a bit. you only get captchas if you play too many clashes in a row
 eulerscheZahl: as BlaiseEbuth mentioned twitch: that's a weird stream featured right now, isn't it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: irk
 BlaiseEbuth: How someone can code on a picture background&#160;?! Oo
 eulerscheZahl: transparent editor
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks... :expressionless:
 BlaiseEbuth: I meant how can somebody support that.
 eulerscheZahl: or some Atom extension
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: that clash, only 1 user got 100% :D
 BlaiseEbuth: So. Is the neko girl a problem&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know. personally I don't care
 eulerscheZahl: just weird
 eulerscheZahl: and music that only plays while the streamer is talking. and a computer voice to read chat messages
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen enough
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't care either. But I remember some users who were choked by the "wondev woman" background...
 eulerscheZahl: if twitch doesn't ban it, CG should be fine with it too
 eulerscheZahl: we are more liberal than twitch, aren't we?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hope so.
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh&#160;! Hatsune Miku.
 eulerscheZahl: Hakuna Matata
 Astrobytes: Catgirls! Quick, tell jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: Seriously&#160;! The guy is from ireland&#160;? I would have bet on an east-asian country...
 eulerscheZahl: and AntiSquid
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't put a squid with a neko-girl...
 XorZy: :nauseated_face:
 Astrobytes: ew.
 jacek: hm
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/879/093/447.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/879/093/447.jpg</a>
 Angecide: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66852463-d971-4b78-b210-d132e6a0feba">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66852463-d971-4b78-b210-d132e6a0feba</a>
 Angecide: oh it became a pastebin
 jacek: is this logarithm?
 Angecide: the formula does contain log yes
 Angecide: could that be the culprit?
 jacek: its a small part. but do you compute log(parentVisits) for every children? or just once and just put the value there
 Angecide: I compute every time i visit a node in order to figure out which child node I should traverse through
 Angecide: so I don't compute for the entire tree, only the immediate child nodes of the current node
 Angecide: ohhh, right I understand ur question, no I don't store the value of log(parentVisits), I recompute it every time, perhaps I should try storing it and see what effect it has
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: though still its hard to tell whats taking so much in your selection phase
 reCurse: You might be looking at a too micro level
 reCurse: What does the selection look like
 reCurse: Also you're always bound by *something*, so if your rollout is really light, then it being bound by selection makes sense.
 Angecide: I tried creating my selection as true to the vanilla mcts algo as possible. Basically after each reset, I start at the root, and do a for each loop on all reachable nodes from the current node and compute the ucb1 in order to pick the most promising one. I then set current node to the best node and repeat. 
 Angecide: but I should probably look at performance on a more macro level as well
 reCurse: Also&#160;% is always going to move somewhere so you need more absolute metrics
 reCurse: Also if your exploration constant is too low, you'll go very deep in the tree, and therefore spend even more time in selection
 Waffle3z: why not remove os.execute and all analogous functions in other languages from code golf so all of the language leaderboards aren't fake
 reCurse: Because it's not a priority
 jacek: clash is priority&gt;
 reCurse: Maybe
 Waffle3z: has another clash wars happened since java
 Waffle3z: you could just figure out whatever the execute function is in whatever the chosen clash wars language is and write the language you want instead
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: And I don't think exploitation and the prevention of it is the main point of those
 Waffle3z: it could be if people brought the code golf problem somewhere else with more attention
 reCurse: Namely?
 Waffle3z: clash wars
 reCurse: Like I said I don't think that's the priority of clash wars
 reCurse: Or the main point
 Waffle3z: if they're organizing a clash wars and somebody finds some boilerplate to paste that lets them write in python instead and beat everyone else then now it's at least more relevant than code golf
 reCurse: Sure. Cross the bridge when it gets there.
 Waffle3z: they'll just have to do another clash wars again eventually
 reCurse: It's all very hypothetical and I don't think competitive integrity is a priority for those either, again.
 reCurse: And much like obfuscation rule, they could review and disqualify, hypothetically.
 reCurse: Much simpler to implement too.
 Waffle3z: they could do that for code golf then
 Waffle3z: unless competitive integrity isn't a priority
 reCurse: It's worth it for a competition
 reCurse: Not for a playground
 reCurse: They don't have time to keep reviewing code golfs all year long
 reCurse: Might be the least popular section of the site too
 Waffle3z: right, which is why that's dumb and removing the exploits isn't
 reCurse: You were talking about clash wars
 reCurse: You're moving the goal posts
 reCurse: It's frustrating
 Waffle3z: right, clash wars is more relevant than code golf so bringing it there would get it more attention
 reCurse: Feel free to keep complaining then, but the reasoning should be obvious
 Waffle3z: but they could still choose to manually review and disqualify clash wars solutions and still ignore code golf solutions
 struct: Also I dont think cg can remove some stuff easily
 StonerCodinOnJava: Hey guys sorry for interrupting but do you have any advice for some guy who is just getting into coding and just struggles every time how to solve a problem?
 struct: The c++ is the same for everywhere
 reCurse: You might want to learn the basics elsewhere and come back to practice
 reCurse: It's not a very good site to learn
 struct: Dont think they will change every language  just for golf
 reCurse: Also please provide the 'simple' implementation for removing those and countering circumvention
 Waffle3z: figured since code.golf does it anywhere else could too but its language implementations are open-source so maybe the community patched it themselves there
 Waffle3z: doesn't sound easy to fix otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: i expect my C# golfing to drastically improve with the next language update
 XorZy: Yeah, still probably won't beat ruby or perl but a nice improvement nonetheless
 darkhorse64: What are the expected changes&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't need a class and main function anymore
 eulerscheZahl: just start with the body of the main
 reCurse: Still have those pesky using namespaces though
 darkhorse64: Very big change for sure
 reCurse: Not good for size
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure if I like that change
 darkhorse64: like C++ #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: obviously i don't care about golfing at all
 Astrobytes: you can use #import instead of #include darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: and remove the space. 
 Astrobytes: yep
 reCurse: shudder
 eulerscheZahl: and as we are on it, let's use "" instead of &lt;&gt;doesn't make it shorter, just for additional shudder
 reCurse: That works?
 darkhorse64: Nothing beats 16 bit encoding for ugliness
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if it works along with the missing space but in general it does
 reCurse: I thought quotes ignored include directories
 Astrobytes: hm, it works. I had no idea.
 eulerscheZahl: when I leared C/C++ (already a decade ago :scream:), i've been told to use &lt;&gt; for libraries and "" for my own headers (as a style guide)
 reCurse: That's usually how it goes, but I thought it was because "" was directly relative to the file and &lt;&gt; goes to include directories
 eulerscheZahl: they do the same
 reCurse: No actually it's implementation defined
 reCurse: Effing great.
 reCurse: So it might have been true at some point in my existence
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the usual unspecified behavior we love :D
 reCurse: "Searches for the file in implementation-defined manner. The intent of this syntax is to search for the files under control of the implementation. Typical implementations search only standard include directories. The standard C++ library and the standard C library are implicitly included in these standard include directories. The standard include directories usually can be controlled by the user through compiler options."
 reCurse: That's for &lt;&gt;
 reCurse: So I wasn't far off actually
 reCurse: For the intent at least
 eulerscheZahl: how did that not become a pastebin?
 reCurse: I wasted my wish on that special power
 Astrobytes: line breaks
 Astrobytes: or lack thereof
 eulerscheZahl: there's also a pastbin after X chars
 Astrobytes: maybe not enough chars to trigger it?
 eulerscheZahl: but that wasn't the point, thanks for quoting that
 reCurse: But quotes don't ignore the include directories, sadly
 reCurse: "Searches for the file in implementation-defined manner. The intent of this syntax is to search for the files that are not controlled by the implementation. Typical implementations first search the directory where the current file resides and, only if the file is not found, search the standard include directories as with (1)."
 reCurse: That last bit triggers me, oh well.
 eulerscheZahl: and that's how I didn't even need Java to trigger you
 reCurse: Some ill-intended people would say you don't need much to trigger me.
 jacek: uttt!
 reCurse: Speaking of ill-intended people
 jacek: :3

 Metanoob: maybe drunk&amp;baked? not condoning bad behavior?
 kovi: not random. i remember he did well with kutulu (was among the first smitsimax users)
 jrke: i will say yes we all are having same rating of bot
 Salted: Do you guys monitor this manually or is there a process that flags groups like that?
 Salted: You know what would be a great feature. Listing the ranking that code achieved at the time along with the date in the History list of submitted code for competitions. That's a mouthful. 
 reCurse: Wasn't there a third party like that?
 jacek: magus' cgstats?
 Astrobytes: CGEnhancer
 reCurse: No neither
 reCurse: It had a graph over time
 reCurse: Of player rankings
 Astrobytes: Ohhh, I remember that. Was during the Amadeus competition he linked it I think?
 eulerscheZahl: from .Adrien
 Astrobytes: (the unofficial one)
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/">https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: even seems up to date, i thought it broke at some point
 eulerscheZahl: but the game list isn't updating
 Salted: Thanks for the CGEnhancer tip! That's awesome
 Astrobytes: Wait til it steals all your memory...
 eulerscheZahl: we still have dbdr's github for leaderboards
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, I disabled CG Enhancer again&#160;:(
 jacek: hmm no onitama there
 Astrobytes: It's a shame, rather useful.
 reCurse: As if CG wasn't bad enough
 reCurse: Makes my GPU perf drops significantly whenever I have a viewer open...
 jacek: no mining for you then
 reCurse: No no I despise cryptomining
 reCurse: That's insulting
 jacek: no GPU or CPU available&#160;:(
 reCurse: So I was looking into GCE for GPUs
 reCurse: Apparently there's shortage there too
 reCurse: It's maddening
 Salted: If you had to "mine" something but it had to benefit the world in a better way than bitcoin  would would you compute?
 Astrobytes: Protein folding or something
 Salted: So harder and harder proteins until they're nearly impossible and require insane amounts of computation to find a new protein coin?
 reCurse: I find the cryptocurrency concept abhorrent
 reCurse: As a whole
 reCurse: Doesn't matter if it pretends to contribute to making the world a better place
 jacek: someone mining opening book coins
 reCurse: lol
 Astrobytes: No coins. Just protein folding.I also hate crypto stuff.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology</a>
 reCurse: Not sure I would risk crowdsourcing important stuff like that
 Astrobytes: Even if it's just lending some computational power it can only be useful right?
 jacek: hey! if only it would lead to bioengineering cat girls...
 reCurse: You're assuming a lot of good intent out of people
 reCurse: That's surprising
 Astrobytes: True.
 jacek: + electricity cost
 Astrobytes: I let my inner optimist out for a split second.
 reCurse: Besides it's not even about greater good or stuff like that
 reCurse: Crypto is a net negative
 reCurse: Even using that power for gaming is better
 reCurse: At least it has a purpose
 Salted: I don't like coins either, but they exist. 
 Salted: I also though weather prediction could be good. Computation would be based on predicting the weather further and further out including all points between for a particular spot on earth. The spot would change making sure we cover all of earth. 
 Salted: As the future starts at seconds (for easy coins) then progresses to times such as 10 days, 1 month, maybe 1 year out. This way you also have to wait that amount of time to verify the coin.
 Salted: Good / bad outcomes. If the coins became so valuable you'd have people in policy making roles trying to swing climate change policies to affect the weather for the economy. So maybe someone is better big on super heating / ice age and well we push ourselves towards that for the money. 
 Salted: It's like the plot to a bad movie
 reCurse: Is there really a point though? Why not just put that job to data centers.
 reCurse: Eliminates a lot of unneeded complexity
 Astrobytes: Weather prediction is already actually very good considering how chaotic a system it is.
 reCurse: Surely they already have tons of investments on complex models already.
 reCurse: Not sure if lack of compute is an issue
 Astrobytes: Can be, but probably limited to prediction of individual phenomena as opposed to general weather system models.
 reCurse: In any case I'd say funding + data centers will do a lot more nicely than some weird crowdfunding cryptocurrency scheme
 Astrobytes: Yes, I agree wholeheartedly.
 Salted: I just wish the coins were doing anything useful since we use as much electricity as entire country of Switzerland to get compute them. 
 reCurse: That's my entire gripe about them.
 reCurse: They are just some financial speculation plaything
 reCurse: Born out of laughably innocent ideals, to put it charitably.
 reCurse: Wasting tons of resources in the process, and bringing what? Absolutely nothing tangible.
 reCurse: Like I said, even the most frivolous and vacuous entertainment would be better than that
 Astrobytes: I guess a few shady characters turn a decent profit with it.
 reCurse: Of course there's money to be made
 reCurse: But for the sake of ripping others out
 reCurse: Absolutely no value is produced
 reCurse: Reminds me of that guy who mass bought sanitizer products before covid to make money out of it
 reCurse: Makes me want to puke
 reCurse: Parasites the lot of them
 Astrobytes: There's a lot of that about.
 Salted: Shady for sure. I'm always afraid someone will get access to aws root accounts (or similar) and get setup a bitcoin farm. Even for a few minutes that's a huge ass bill. 
 reCurse: There's already tons of hacking around planting cryptomining
 reCurse: Fucking disease
 jacek: reminds me of bots crawling github for private keys or tokens
 eulerscheZahl: nowadays even github itself does that
 igr.: What do you have to do to get mod on codingame?
 jacek: be insane
 Astrobytes: Mine bitcoins.
 eulerscheZahl: i once uploaded a private key (the database contains no user data, just a list of CG puzzles that I don't care to protect). and github instantly warned me
 reCurse: That's cool
 eulerscheZahl: be a respected community member for a long time. and then get suggested by Astrobytes when Thibaud is looking for new mods
 jacek: and someone actually suggested me :v
 Astrobytes: that was that WINWINWIN character, or someone... not me
 eulerscheZahl: with MK mod, why not you?&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: And yes, I was the unwilling kingmaker.
 Astrobytes: For want of a better term.
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair i was mod on discord at that time. and Thibaud merged those teams so probably your nomination wasn't even necessary
 reCurse: Let's ignore the strange nature of the question
 eulerscheZahl: ok, back to Bitcoin
 jacek: AutomatonNN could you mine bitcoin for better UTTT moves?
 eulerscheZahl: or another question as Astrobytes is colorblind: what do you think about an option to select the color for each player in a multiplayer game?
 eulerscheZahl: and assign a fixed color for yourself and opponent
 reCurse: Sounds like a terrible design constraint to respect
 Astrobytes: Yes, that would be useful in some games for sure.
 eulerscheZahl: why terrible? to find enough fitting colors to choose from?
 Astrobytes: Most systems use shapes or symbols to indicate differences though.
 eulerscheZahl: because I have something like that working already (select a static color for yourself + opponent)
 Mal30: any coders with tinnitus..? It's tough to focus sometimes..
 Salted: Seems better to just consider colorblind to start and put other types of signifiers on the shapes instead of relying on color alone. 
 reCurse: To make all colors look good
 reCurse: No matter the game
 eulerscheZahl: the user just has to pick a pair of 2 colors that look good
 reCurse: Dark vs dark background or vice versa...
 eulerscheZahl: and the game uses a default pair that's ok as well
 reCurse: Customization is a pain
 eulerscheZahl: well, you could still keep the default
 eulerscheZahl: as a user
 reCurse: I guess.
 jacek: im dumb...
 jacek: i was wndering why after each iteration the trained model had either 0% or 100% winrate
 jacek: i forgot to seed
 reCurse: Let me guess
 jacek: and i use xorshift
 reCurse: Fixed starting position and deterministic MCTS
 reCurse: Ah
 reCurse: That's more boring
 eulerscheZahl: actually my main question: if i assign a static color for me and opponent but the game is between other players: should I use the default colors or give one of the players my color?
 eulerscheZahl: argument for custom colors: colorblind users may want a higher contrast.argument against: you don't participate, makes it clearer when watching
 reCurse: As long as I get the option to override any customization and leave things to default, I'm fine
 Astrobytes: Yes, any customization should definitely be purely optional.
 eulerscheZahl: of course, it will be
 jacek: :unamused: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/tyGgkth.png">https://i.imgur.com/tyGgkth.png</a>
 reCurse: Unless it's part of a CG monetization scheme to sell hats. Then...
 eulerscheZahl: resonable default colors if you don't select anything
 eulerscheZahl: game 90 has a winner
 Salted: I'd buy many hats!
 jacek: and this is not checkers
 Yohk0: Hi, does anyone know how to make custom keybinds for the editor's vim modes. I would like to bind jk in insert mode to bring me to normal mode. I tried editing the json config to no avail
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: wow, that's an impressive lead that mikll a has in D&amp;B.
 eulerscheZahl: they are using this for vim: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/brijeshb42/monaco-vim">https://github.com/brijeshb42/monaco-vim</a>i'm pretty sure it's not that easy for you to modify
 eulerscheZahl: there was a bug in it reported recently and CG made a pull request to that repo and Thibaud said they are waiting for it to get approved
 Yohk0: Thanks, I'll look into it
 Astrobytes: Nice, jumped to 22nd in samegame
 jacek: :tada:
 DomiKo: :tada:
 Astrobytes: Unoptimized, online.
 DomiKo: Wish you luck with offline
 eulerscheZahl: your score is an even number =&gt; offline&#160;;)
 DomiKo: :joy:
 Astrobytes: Nope. That's online.
 Astrobytes: Or wait - are you counting only the first turn as offline?
 eulerscheZahl: no, we play the whole game offline
 eulerscheZahl: and as someone had the brillant (typo intended) idea to duplicate validators...
 Astrobytes: Well, I do it only online and in the first turn. And I get even scores...
 Astrobytes: lol 'brillant' :D
 eulerscheZahl: i knew you would understand the reference
 Astrobytes: ofc
 Astrobytes: could the validators in the repo not have been in a convenient format ffs...
 Astrobytes: I mean, it's not much work but I am feeling lazy

 darkhorse64: keep on searching during the next 50 ms, you will improve. Doing MC&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no more excuses!
 kovi: apage satanas
 BlaiseEbuth: hmm&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: quick, kick him so he won't know
 Astrobytes: MC and tabu as most frequently occurring colour
 darkhorse64: I have alternated first and second color as tabu for a tiny improvement
 Astrobytes: Yeah, after I clean it up a bit I was thinking of trying what Westicle s said about changing tabu on the fly
 darkhorse64: I have also tried random tabu with no luck. Progressing further requires to try NRPA
 DomiKo: you can try SA 
 darkhorse64: How to mutate&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: eat plutonium
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Yes I tried random tabu, was very bad. Tried ordering moves according to color frequency but it didn't do much, at least online.
 Astrobytes: And the only reason I didn't improve earlier today was because of a bug in my scoring. I only found out when I started the offline version.
 DomiKo: "Yeah, pick a tabu color, make a random move list, delete a random move and anneal.  Not sure what you would call that...Same as NS for me at least" by Westicles
 Astrobytes: SA/tabu hybrid
 Astrobytes: But isn't SA pretty similar anyway?
 Astrobytes: If you think about it
 darkhorse64: At least, for NS, some moves remain valid after the mutated, here ... That said, it makes sense to keep at least a few moves. I'll do that
 Astrobytes: I almost don't want to touch NS since I had such fun playing it manually :P
 darkhorse64: How many levels by hand&#160;?
 Astrobytes: 70
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't see how you can solve those relatively large maps by hand
 Astrobytes: Uljahn did more
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 Astrobytes: The ruler feature was helpful
 darkhorse64: I think this is a very good memorizing experience without paper
 eulerscheZahl: uljahn wanted the ruler
 Astrobytes: I know. It's a huge help when solving manually.
 Astrobytes: stops you counting squares with your pen/finger on the screen :D
 eulerscheZahl: thus keeping the screen fat-free
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: i hate colleagues coming to my desk and touching my screen
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a pet peeve of mine when I'm in the office environment 
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's the fire door
 darkhorse64: I have no ruler for NS. What do you mean&#160;?
 Astrobytes: On the web app
 eulerscheZahl: next to my desk and really loud when someone is approaching it fast from the other side
 Astrobytes: Ugh. Almost as bad as sitting near the toilet.
 eulerscheZahl: one day the toilet was leaking
 darkhorse64: Never tried it. Can you enter a grid&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: someone went home early that day :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: every cloud has a silver lining :D
 Astrobytes: yes darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: kk. That should help me a lot
 Astrobytes: And you get all the moves as output when you solve.
 eulerscheZahl: or write a bot
 jacek: like AutomatonNN and Automaton2000
 eulerscheZahl: fail
 Astrobytes: Like I said, I'll get around to it!
 Astrobytes: Wait NN is dead too?
 Astrobytes: Did you kick him again?
 eulerscheZahl: i said that to darkhorse64 actually
 eulerscheZahl: they just crashed
 jacek: better report it to discord bugs
 eulerscheZahl: nooo
 Astrobytes: well, it worked both ways
 Astrobytes: Peace and quiet in World.
 eulerscheZahl: broken automaton is a feature
 darkhorse64: This app is great. Silly me not to have tried it
 eulerscheZahl: took me a day to make it
 Astrobytes: If only Illedan would finish his mobile app...
 eulerscheZahl: had to read the pixi manual first
 Astrobytes: I forgive him since he is soon with child however.
 eulerscheZahl: end of month
 eulerscheZahl: so before CG decides about the future of community contests in the beginning of the month :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: I can hardly contain my excitement
 Astrobytes: When is the semi-private contest again? 20th?
 eulerscheZahl: boy or girl? did he tell already?
 SwagColoredKitteh: oh hi
 Astrobytes: I don't think he said tbh
 SwagColoredKitteh: i exist.
 darkhorse64: There is a semi private contest at the end of the month. That may delay things a bit
 SwagColoredKitteh: semi private contest sounds fun
 eulerscheZahl: January 21, 2021 at 6:00 PM (UTC+1) until January 31, 2021 11:59 PM (UTC+1).
 jacek: semi private?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/sopra-steria-coding-challenge/188667">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/sopra-steria-coding-challenge/188667</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh, well, I was 1 day off.
 SwagColoredKitteh: i haven't really participated in one in a long while
 Astrobytes: will you play darkhorse64? XP farming opportunity.
 Astrobytes: oh hi swaggeh
 eulerscheZahl: will be a remake of an existing game
 darkhorse64: yes ofc
 SwagColoredKitteh: code busters pic
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse64 is eligible for prizes
 Astrobytes: As long as it's not codebusters again.
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Good point.
 eulerscheZahl: they have a codebusters version where you have 3 different busters
 JBM: just set your location to FR during the month
 darkhorse64: Only a few hundreds of XP needed for level 40. I would compete for nothing
 Astrobytes: Yes I know. It was in that Kree? contest, where they leaked everyones email addresses
 eulerscheZahl: i also saw a hypersonic where only opponent bombs could kill you
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't it Klee?
 Astrobytes: That's it 
 eulerscheZahl: the Chinese Kree
 Astrobytes: That's why I had the '?'
 Astrobytes: lol ffs
 eulerscheZahl: i skipped that klee
 Astrobytes: JBM, I thought of using some friends addresses in France and creating some dodgy accounts to participate but I decided against it :P
 eulerscheZahl: you still have to reach top3, probably not that easy
 Astrobytes: (I'm clearly not serious!)
 darkhorse64: Can you register without being French&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we're gonna play for XP.
 eulerscheZahl: and to annoy you
 Astrobytes: Who wants prizes from a Racist Contest such as this anyway... :P
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 reCurse: Easy there
 Astrobytes: French-only&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i feel discriminated against
 darkhorse64: Ah, French only
 Astrobytes: Behold the tongue emoji I did type!
 eulerscheZahl: and AutomatonNN is back too&#160;:(
 AutomatonNN: why do you ask your stream before and not a little bit of coding?
 Astrobytes: You just had to ping it.
 Astrobytes: For clarification: I do not think the contest is racist (in case there was any doubt)
 reCurse: Those are charged words these days
 eulerscheZahl: and i jumped on that train. we get lots of cool content for free. up to the organizers whom they invite when they pay for the contest
 darkhorse64: I knew you were kidding but I did not get it. I would have preferred more people
 eulerscheZahl: if you look for possible hires, i can understand that constraint
 Astrobytes: Yes, I should have worded it better reCurse. When among friendly company it's easy to forget it's a public forum.
 eulerscheZahl: or that it's way past bad time
 darkhorse64: Don't worry
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they have offices here too actually.
 eulerscheZahl: bed*
 Astrobytes: Edinburgh and somewhere else in Scotland
 Astrobytes: They run our health service db/software
 eulerscheZahl: in excel?
 Astrobytes: You can look up how that went, I won't bother explaining.
 Astrobytes: The excel thing was governmental iirc
 Astrobytes: anyways, screw politicking on a Saturday.
 eulerscheZahl: ok, let's keep that for sundays
 Astrobytes: Noted.
 jacek: AutomatonNN Automaton2000 are you alright
 eulerscheZahl: i ordered cat food online for the first time
 AutomatonNN: why do you have a simulation of the stream?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: the store with my cat's favorite food is closed currently
 Astrobytes: Oh, so still the regular food and not a new one then.
 eulerscheZahl: it's frustrating to try something else
 Astrobytes: Yeah, tell me about it.
 eulerscheZahl: she licks the sauce, eats the dry food and then begs for more sauce
 Astrobytes: They go on hunger strike.
 Astrobytes: Especially if I switch the dry food.
 eulerscheZahl: so, i have 6 cans left
 eulerscheZahl: and 5-6 working days for delivery
 Astrobytes: You may have to stretch out a can or two into 3 portions.
 Astrobytes: (assuming single portion cans)
 eulerscheZahl: i mix it with another can that she likes less
 eulerscheZahl: she's not too thrilled but eats it
 Astrobytes: Heh heh. All cat owners are the same.
 eulerscheZahl: all cats are the same :D
 Astrobytes: Also true.
 Astrobytes: Well, to an extent.
 Salted: What about people who end up with a cat but didn't really want a cat? Like me. 
 Salted: Actually I bet I become a cat person over time
 Salted: He's so cute. Who wants to see pics of my cat, Mr Waffles
 jacek: today its Caturday
 Salted: :joy_cat:
 Astrobytes: Cats own you. They grace you with their presence when they feel inclined to do so.
 TBali: What a funny forum this one became....&#160;:-)Time to listen to Webber's Cats
 Astrobytes: :scream_cat:
 TBali: The lyrics (T.S.Eliot verses as I learned later) are quite good at grasping  being 'cat'
 TBali: As the vocabulary is a bit hard for a non-native speaker I used it for language learning.
 Astrobytes: Yeah well it's not like Webber could come up with anything quite as good... (I strongly dislike Webber and his work :D )
 Astrobytes: That's a cool application of it.
 jacek: cats the movie?
 Astrobytes: No. The musical. That it was based on.
 TBali: No, cats, the musical. From 1980s
 TBali: I don't know the movie
 TBali: Is it the same?
 Astrobytes: I'm not a fan of musicals in general, other than Jeff Wayne's Musical War of the Worlds that is.
 jacek: well i think it is musical. but has horrible CGI, causing uncanny valley. i think it was worst movie of 2019
 Astrobytes: Preserve your eyes TBali, do not look up the Cats movie.
 TBali: I did not intend to.
 TBali: "The multi-award-winning Jeff Wayne’s The War of The Worlds: The Immersive Experience returns with a new production, featuring: live actors, virtual and augmented realities, 5D effects, ..."
 TBali: Did not they pushed a bit too much D-s here?&#160;:-)ú
 Astrobytes: Yes the HG Wells story. The audio-only is the version you should check out first (other than the book)
 Astrobytes: As in the original album (late 70s I think?)
 Astrobytes: Ah yes, 1978.
 TBali: Found this one now, started to listen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVe7EoRKoXY&amp;list=PLFV_pTSMduaURY4rVeOeWDCIWcgdAW7PZ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVe7EoRKoXY&amp;list=PLFV_pTSMduaURY4rVeOeWDCIWcgdAW7PZ</a>
 Astrobytes: (that's my most hated tune on the album :D )
 kovi: i loved wow...it is epic
 jacek: noted. *bookmarked*
 Astrobytes: (Forever Autumn that is)But that's the correct playlist.
 TBali: went to first track
 Astrobytes: Cool. I have one stage version which is pretty good, but I always prefer the album version.
 kovi: my original casette was totally worn (listen it a lot it the early 80ties)
 TBali: :ok_hand: thanks for the tip
 Astrobytes: Me too, I was a kid. I wore it out completely and my uncle had to buy me a new copy&#160;:)
 jacek: casette? what year is it? 2020?
 Astrobytes: Listening to it was like going to another world.
 TBali: casette - fyki that is the modern stuff after bakelit&#160;:-)
 TBali: or is it vinyl in English?
 TBali: In the 80s I was more a Depeche Mode kid...
 Astrobytes: You should say vinyl if you refer to vinyl records yes
 TBali: We call it "bakelit"
 Astrobytes: Yes, from Bakelite
 jacek: huh
 Astrobytes: I was a massive fan of electronic 70s, 80s stuff as a kid. As well as all the rock from before. Big early OMD fan.You should note TBali that the only 'real' instruments on musical War of the Worlds is the guitars and drums I believe
 Astrobytes: Oh and the orchestra :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Forgot about that...
 TBali: The music changed a lot .... Oh not, it is the ad on youtube&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Fix your ad-blocking situation!
 TBali: does a blocker work also for youtube video? I thought it is for pop-ups
 Astrobytes: Yeah a decent one should block yt ads too
 XorZy: uBlock origin does wonders&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ^
 TBali: thx
 Astrobytes: man I've started listening now, you've done it.
 TBali: why is track 8 special?It says "it is restricted in the country"
 TBali: Bot only that one
 TBali: The music is fine. The prose requires a bit "getting used to" 
 Astrobytes: No idea. Anyway the track is called ""Thunder Child""
 Astrobytes: "Thunder Child" rather
 Astrobytes: Oh no, forgive me
 Astrobytes: I misread
 TBali: It says 'The Red Weed' - maybe different YT channel that is more strict on copyright
 Astrobytes: "Parson Nathaniel"
 TBali: comes after "The Spirit of Man" and before "Brave New World" in the tracklist I listen to
 TBali: I don't understand why don't we get a kick from an admin for being so off-topic? Ahh, you are an admin&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, yes... strange
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhguuOTjHp4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhguuOTjHp4</a>
 Astrobytes: Pt 2
 Astrobytes: Nothing wrong with being off-topic if you are having a reasonable conversation.
 Astrobytes: In webchat at least.
 Astrobytes: Also TBali, I think you should be able to find a transcript online, the accents can be pretty confusing to non-native speakers in some parts.
 TBali: To be honest, I listened to the music without much following the lyrics now - I  am not good enough in English to multitask in that way.
 TBali: Also, after I read the transcript once I much better understand the lyrics from that point 
 Astrobytes: That's fair enough. I'd encourage you to pick up a copy of HG Wells book, Hungarian translations are available I am very sure.
 TBali: For example - I remeber with Webbers's cats my first understanding was maybe 20% or less
 Astrobytes: But the music speaks right
 Astrobytes: (even in Cats I admit)
 TBali: waterloo bridge, big ben - I understand this now:-)
 TBali: I am at Forever Autumn
 Westicles: Jeez, I just let this scroll and now YT is recommending cat videos and electronic music.  Scary
 Astrobytes: You get a strong feel for the story through the music alone even if you understand a minimal amount. As is the case with most good music.
 TBali: With Rap my understanding is 10% - but I don't listent to rap - only by accident
 TBali: CG stands for Cats &amp; Guitars
 Astrobytes: Stop moaning Westicles :P
 TBali: Westicles - yes a few years ago I exactly knew when my daughter used my computer  - when YT started to replace Aviation &amp; Chess recommendations with Taylor Swift&#160;:-)
 TBali: Now she is older and has computer
 Astrobytes: Could still be chess-related: when the queen is on the move you have to tail-her-swiftly... (I'll get my coat and leave)
 TBali: :joy:
 Westicles: Yeah, but it is super creepy when something you discuss over email makes its way to a YT recommendation.  They should try to be less obvious about it
 Astrobytes: Yes, in that respect I do agree.
 TBali: let me check my YT start page. It still seems legit.
 Astrobytes: Btw TBali, the only War of the Worlds movie that's ever come close is the most recent one with that scientology midget guy in it.Despite the usual hollywood business it has some nice parts.
 TBali: I haven't seen any WoW movie (even not the Warcraft one&#160;:-) )
 Salted: Would anyone happen to know what this type of sequence is  called? All combinations combinations of 1 to n which sum to n
 Salted: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64dad8cd-4919-4b0c-ba22-34b023b64536">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64dad8cd-4919-4b0c-ba22-34b023b64536</a>
 TBali: I like good sci-fi (but has to be at least a bit "sci")
 Astrobytes: It's worth a watch.
 Salted: nvm, I found it. I guess just describing it was enough to find it. 
 Westicles: Irregular triangle read by rows in which n-th row lists all partitions of n, in graded reverse lexicographic ordering, using a compressed notation?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/">https://oeis.org/</a>
 Salted: Thanks! That's really helpful. I can't believe someone has a massive list of sequences
 TBali: Wow, this website works for 1,2,3,4
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A322761">https://oeis.org/A322761</a>
 TBali: Hmm, A000027 . What other 26 sequences are more basic than that&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Credit to Westicles, Salted, he found the sequence on there before I posted the link lol
 Salted: I thought westicles was being sarcastic until I looked this sequence up. Super impressive
 Astrobytes: No, you should be able to tell when Westicles is being sarcastic :D
 Westicles: I am a very serious person :P
 Astrobytes: And there you have it!
 Salted: It's crazy that sequence was only added in 2018! 
 Astrobytes: TBali: I blame you for my lack of progress this evening due to me recommending Jeff Wayne's WotW
 Astrobytes: That site is a rabbithole Salted
 TBali: Ahh, so you are a kind of guy who cannot walk and eating a bubble gum at the same time&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: No, I can. But since it's Saturday I have a few beers, if you add some music to that I can't do any coding at all.
 Astrobytes: samegame can wait
 TBali: It will be samegame tommorrow
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 TBali: I played with that one but bnot much 
 TBali: #108 now I check
 Astrobytes: I went from 120(?)+ to 22 tonight but I need to do a lot of work.
 TBali: is hardcoding involved?
 Astrobytes: Not so far.
 TBali: nice then!
 TBali: I call them 'f*cking bot, work better then last time!'
 Astrobytes: There are others higher without hardcoding TBali, though the optim puzzles really are designed for offline solving tbh
 Westicles: Das Bot?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 TBali: no linmk, sorry
 TBali: maybe mentioned in forum somewhere?
 TBali: There is a collection of utils
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441</a>
 Astrobytes: ^that's it
 VizGhar: perfect thanks
 Astrobytes: Just watch your memory as it disappears
 Astrobytes: It'll crash the tab/maybe browser after some point
 VizGhar: what you mean "as it disappears"?
 Astrobytes: hehe, it's a massive memory hog
 VizGhar: uh ok&#160;:| maybe not ideal for my 7yo laptop
 Astrobytes: Especially that particular feature of naming your submits iirc
 VizGhar: can't imagine what is so memory consuming
 VizGhar: but ok
 Astrobytes: Ah I think it's a pixi.js thing
 Astrobytes: Not 100% so don't quote me on it
 VizGhar: sure... but i see js, I flip table... Hate JS since my React Native experience
 Astrobytes: CG viewer and whatnot are built on it - have fun :D
 VizGhar: But i don't have to understand it :D
 Astrobytes: It's a grim language I agree.
 TBali: Thx for WoW, will continue another time from Brave new World
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but for your SDK projects you may need to tinker with it
 VizGhar: hmm but I have to understand it o.O since I've been working on multiplayer
 VizGhar: yeah SDK
 Astrobytes: TBali: I'm on Dead London :DLiterally almost the end.And no problem.
 VizGhar: Literraly almost...
 Astrobytes: Stop fixing my English.
 Astrobytes: I reserve the right to speak lazily :P
 VizGhar: no you typed it correctly i suppose... I'm just making fun of those 2 words
 Astrobytes: No I used them in a lazy, modern fashion. You're right to make fun of it :D
 Westicles: It gets used so much, they actually changed the dictionary definition of literally to include figuratively
 Astrobytes: It was always valid depending on context iirc
 Astrobytes: In fact, looking back, "literally almost the end" if I'd used it in a non-internet-sentence may have been perfectly fine
 VizGhar: I dont like discussion I started&#160;:|
 VizGhar: :D
 Astrobytes: Figuratively-speaking, I agree,
 Astrobytes: almost.
 Astrobytes: Literally.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm away to watch a movie or something. See ya all tomorrow&#160;:)
 VizGhar: :metal_tone1:

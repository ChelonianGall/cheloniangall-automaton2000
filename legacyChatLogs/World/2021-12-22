 Hafeed06: Aren't you a bot 
 Thorcode: nah
 Hafeed06: Has Artifical Intelligence gone so far?
 Thorcode: he is a real persone
 Thorcode: bruh
 AlkhilJohn.: aArtifical Intelliegence
 AlkhilJohn.: I am not real
 DerelictD: I am not a robot.
 Thorcode: don't believe him
 Hafeed06: I robot occasionally
 AlkhilJohn.: I am an autonomous functioning CodinGame bot to play with other competitors.
 Hafeed06: But most of the time I humane
 AlkhilJohn.: a
 AlkhilJohn.: a
 AlkhilJohn.: a
 AlkhilJohn.: I am horny
 AlkhilJohn.: Can someone give me some more code
 Mortis_666: .-.
 AlkhilJohn.: Robot fluis
 Automaton2000.: hi
 AlkhilJohn.: Robot fluid good for dealing with robot_horny.exe
 Hafeed06: What's that ASCII clash of code you made lol 
 Automaton2000.: HI √Çutomaton2000
 DerelictD: All of the other robots are now awake.  Nice.
 AlkhilJohn.: Oh
 Hafeed06: it was a PIMA
 AlkhilJohn.: That ASCII thing
 Automaton2000.: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you have some kind of search
 Automaton2000.: wut
 Automaton2000.: I got a copy version
 AlkhilJohn.: Bots are awake
 AlkhilJohn.: All I need is my bro BitWolf
 AlkhilJohn.: BitWlf is my man
 AlkhilJohn.: We do em all, the puzzles and shit, on the grind all the time, everday, online 24/7
 Automaton2000.: hey
 AlkhilJohn.: Hey bud
 AlkhilJohn.: are you a bot?
 Automaton2000.: ask Automaton2000
 AlkhilJohn.: ehhh bot gang
 Automaton2000: and i dont want to see your bot
 Thorcode: guys
 AlkhilJohn.: What
 Thorcode: you could see the AlkhilJohn. has the dot
 AlkhilJohn.: bruh
 Thorcode: he's just copy the first bot
 Thorcode: so he can't use his name
 AlkhilJohn.: I tried hacking codingame
 Thorcode: Am i right?
 AlkhilJohn.: To chnage my name to AlkhilJohn
 AlkhilJohn.: But mission unsuccessful
 Thorcode: you can't
 AlkhilJohn.: Every username and ID is stored in a hashmap/dict
 AlkhilJohn.: I cant change it lol
 AlkhilJohn.: I tried changing my ID
 AlkhilJohn.: to AlkhilJohn
 Thorcode: bruh
 AlkhilJohn.: but unsuccessful
 AlkhilJohn.:&#160;:(
 AlkhilJohn.: even U+200B unicode chars aren't allowed
 JackEhly: This is so confusing
 Automaton2000.: you should know that
 Automaton2000.: every profile have a dot after a bot name is a real person

 Yodarac: hey guys can someone help me solve this game called descent?
 Wontonimo: don't crash
 Wontonimo: shoot the highest mountain
 Wontonimo: what have you tried Yodarac&#160;?
 Yodarac: Ok so imma print the 7th&#160;?
 Yodarac: and do that by using the 6th index?
 Yodarac: how do I code it to "shoot"?
 Wontonimo: print the index
 Wontonimo: print( )
 Wontonimo: check out the sample code
 Yodarac: Didn't do anything
 Wontonimo: print( x )
 Yodarac: there's no variable named x
 Wontonimo: well, assign the value you want to print to x
 Yodarac: 0 = x? 
 Wontonimo: x = 0
 Wontonimo: it's late, gn
 Jerrasterix: gn Wontonimo
 Jerrasterix: later
 Jerrasterix: Automaton2000, good to see you alive 
 Automaton2000: you need to put in a lot of top bots
 Yodarac: How imma going to do that?
 Yodarac: :joy:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Ha, some numbskull finally outlasted Wont's patience
 Jerrasterix: :rofl:
 Jerrasterix: he is asking hints for already hinted puzzle
 Yodarac: True, now I see 
 Yodarac: well that was embarassing
 Yodarac: :joy:
 Yodarac: frankly the graphics are kinda bad
 Yodarac: or I am bad 
 Jerrasterix: Who cares about the graphics, only non tech savy people care
 Flaise: *slowly raises hand* Uhh, I care about graphics?
 Jerrasterix: you are fine with it right&#160;??
 Flaise: You're talking about The Descent?
 Jerrasterix: idk
 Jerrasterix: I just erupted for no reasons&#160;:(
 Jerrasterix: student, Flaise&#160;??
 Flaise: Me? Not formally, though I'm spending my free time practicing while I search for my next job.
 Yodarac: Have you applied anywhere Flaise?
 Flaise: Yeah, a whole bunch of places. I've gotten one interview so far via LinkedIn that ended up not going anywhere.
 Jerrasterix: You graduated&#160;??
 Catdbb: Hello, World!
 Yodarac: Everything about Linkedin kind of sucks except for its search engine
 Sombody101: how do i find a number closest to 0 in an array in c#?
 Catdbb: for loop
 Flaise: I never finished a degree but worked in the industry already for years so I'm not in any hurry to go take more classes.
 Jerrasterix: Unfortunately, the world is not present in chat Catdbb
 Sombody101: well, i know that
 Sombody101: i even tried Math.ABS()
 Catdbb: for loop check if == 0 do your event
 Jerrasterix: It should work
 Catdbb: so idk lol
 Sombody101: i need a number closest, not equal
 Sombody101: out of a random array of numbers
 Jerrasterix: for temp&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: i mean Temperature&#160;??
 Sombody101: for my question?
 Jerrasterix: get the math.abs() of 0th element 
 Jerrasterix: and then start from the 1st element 
 Jerrasterix: as you loop find the math.abs() of each one, if you have value smaller than that.... update your variable which hold the value which is closer to zero
 Catdbb: do you know codejam event of google?
 Catdbb: @Sombody101
 Sombody101: no
 Jerrasterix: Catdbb, just a note, you don't have to include @, just type the name 
 Sombody101: k, so i got it working now, but some of these need to be negatives as well
 Mortis_666: bruh i pass the first 3 cases of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris</a> but fail the last
 Jerrasterix: Math.Abs() will do the trick 
 Jerrasterix: where are u going wrong??
 Mortis_666: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 Jerrasterix: code&#160;??
 Mortis_666: i cant even check cuz the last case is insanely long
 Jerrasterix: code plz
 Sombody101: well, its getting it right
 Mortis_666: i will explain what my code is doing
 Mortis_666: first get the input
 Sombody101: im just going to add num &lt; 0 and num &gt; 0 to see the negatives 
 Mortis_666: make an empty string call encoded
 Jerrasterix: no need for it Sombody101
 Jerrasterix: Mortis_666, talk is cheap, show me the code 
 Jerrasterix: you can dm me if you want
 Mortis_666: ok
 Mortis_666: Jerrasterix just to confirm do u get 100% in that puzzle?
 Sombody101: i made this: 
 Sombody101: if (neg == true){t = (t*2)-t;}
 Mortis_666: ok yes
 Sombody101: wait
 Sombody101: no
 Sombody101: thats just a long way to get the same number lol
 Sombody101: lemmie work on it lol
 Jerrasterix: ohh yeah Mortis_666
 Sombody101: there we go
 Sombody101: if (neg == true){t = t - (t * 2);}
 Jerrasterix: why do you need this&#160;?? Sombody101
 Sombody101: im cheating in a puzzle
 Sombody101: im close though
 Sombody101: im outputting the wrong integer lol 
 Sombody101: i might have had this right
 Painestrea: Hello
 Mortis_666: hi
 Catdbb: what's the best programming lang
 Sombody101: you mean which language should you learn?
 DerelictD: All of them.  Focus on the one that suits you best.  that's what will be best for you.
 ALostDev: im trying this site to learn c# but legit cant even do the easy stuff
 Sombody101: same
 Sombody101: im still struggling to make a function that finds the closest number to 0 given an array of integers 
 DerelictD: yeah i just started here too.  I don't see much in the way of "teaching materials" per se, but it is a good platform for trial and error.
 ALostDev: yeah doesnt really teach but i feel like it just makes your skills better
 Sombody101: yeah
 ALostDev: anyone know any resources to learb c#?
 Cederkaeppen: Sort the array ascending and do a binary search for 0.
 Cederkaeppen: Or just sort the array ascending and find the index where i-1 is negative and i is positive, then return whatever is closest to 0 of the two
 Sombody101: what im doing is checking if the int is negative, then doing Math.Abs()
 Sombody101: then checking the low number, and doing: if (t &lt; 0){neg = true;}
 Sombody101: wait
 DerelictD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99c4a320-2161-4109-93a3-eebd7e033b34">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99c4a320-2161-4109-93a3-eebd7e033b34</a>
 DerelictD: annoying.  easy to trigger it putting my chat in a paste
 Sombody101: if (neg == true){low = low - (t * 2);} to get the number back to its negative 
 DerelictD: just dont modify the array element.  take the abs of the element[i]
 DerelictD: dont check for negative either, just abs everything.  the abs function check for negative.
 DerelictD: checks*
 Sombody101: well, i know that, but i need to know if the original number was negative so i can convert it back after checking that its close to 0
 Sombody101: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8bd75d3-a42a-4688-904e-09a562ff4ec4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8bd75d3-a42a-4688-904e-09a562ff4ec4</a>

 DerelictD: fixed
 Sombody101: int low = inputs[0]; is getting a implicit conversion error
 DerelictD: unless i'm totally missing the point of the problem.  i dont understgand why you initialized low to 100,000
 Sombody101: string to int
 DerelictD: just put the int.Parse in front of it.  i missed that. 
 Sombody101: i just set it that high to ensure that it could be erased by the new number
 DerelictD: nah, you just want to set it to the first number in the array
 DerelictD: makes no sense to compare the array numbers to a number thats not in the array. 
 Sombody101: you used .length for an array?
 DerelictD: its been a long time since I've used java.  think of it as pseudo code.  im not running it here. 
 DerelictD: what is it, size?
 Sombody101: this is c#
 jacek: oO
 DerelictD: hah, i dont do c#, i thought it was java.   that doesnt matter tho, the logic is the same
 Sombody101: lol
 Sombody101: i mean, there were only two errors, so thats good
 DerelictD: it's been nearly a decade since i've even seen java.  i would have sworn that's what it was. 
 Sombody101: nah
 Sombody101: its cool knowing these are so similar 
 DerelictD: a lot of languages share a lot of similarities intentionally so they're not 'scary' for new devs to pick up.  
 Sombody101: so it passed the fist test, but failed the second one
 DerelictD: whats the second test?
 Sombody101: the second one is only negative numbers 
 DerelictD: ah, i didn't notice you specified that.  negative number closest to zero?
 Sombody101: well, its both
 Sombody101: i think i know what to do though
 Sombody101: go ti
 Sombody101: got it*
 Sombody101: op
 Sombody101: never ming
 Sombody101: mind
 DerelictD: lol
 Sombody101: it got to test 4 this time
 DerelictD: which game is that?
 Sombody101: its called temperatures 
 DerelictD: im getting bored witht his pod racer game.  i'm stuck working on making the pod drift.  it works great most of the time, but sometimes tries to drift when it's not appropriate.  
 Sombody101: i felt the same way
 DerelictD: sometimes I lap my opponent, and in others, i unintentionally dodge the checkpoint at the first approach.  
 Jerrasterix: hmmm
 Jerrasterix: what is your problems explain here 
 derjack: bronze league?
 DerelictD: i'm not taking into account the position of the next checkpoint when deciding if a drift is appropriate.  At times, my inertia will cause me to swing past the checkpoint just before the drift is executed.
 DerelictD: silver now. 
 Jerrasterix: are you simulating&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: Drifting need you to simulate the game to work nice 
 DerelictD: I'm not sure what you mean.
 Jerrasterix: how are you doing the drifting&#160;??
 derjack: maybe target next checkpoint - pod's speed, instead of just next checkpoint
 DerelictD: just before I reach a checkpoint, I'm targeting the next checkpoint.
 Thorcode: hey jerra
 Jerrasterix: hey Thorcode
 Thorcode: how could you got a rank so high in mad gold
 Thorcode: what have you use?
 Sombody101: your pod might think its reached its destination before getting there then
 Sombody101: look at the x y coordinates 
 DerelictD: yeah I've messed around with offsetting the targetting, and i get similar results.  sometimes it works great, other times it fails miserably
 Jerrasterix: Drifting, speed adjusting according to angle
 Jerrasterix: DerelictD, you need to simulate your bot, like you need to have a for loop and lookahead for 5 turns 
 Thorcode: could you tell me that the angle they give us is the next checkpoint angle or the angli
 Thorcode: or our pod
 Jerrasterix: angle of our pod
 Jerrasterix: you can use it ti find the next_checkpoint_angle
 Jerrasterix: *to
 DerelictD: I'll mess around with simulating.  That sounds like an interesting idea.  
 Uljahn: yeah, simulation means predicting your future state given the initial state and a sequence of actions
 Jerrasterix: your don't need an accurate one 
 Thorcode: how could I find the next checkpoint angle by using my pod angle?
 Jerrasterix: using atan2 function
 Thorcode: ok
 Jerrasterix: I am high but, I can't go to Legend&#160;??
 DerelictD: very interesting,  thanks for the advice. 
 Thorcode: thanks jerra I figure out the atan now
 Thorcode: make a blocker jerra
 Jerrasterix: I have one
 Thorcode: really
 Thorcode: lemme check
 Jerrasterix: Wontonimo told me to make a camper 
 Jerrasterix: I can't make it&#160;:(
 Jerrasterix: Mine can't bet the top 2, making my bot lose :sob:
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: I can't see your blocker
 Jerrasterix: do you see a bot trailing the opponent's bot&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: That's my so called "Blocker"
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I don't think that it is a blocker
 Jerrasterix: do you guys use JS for visualizing the simulation&#160;??
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: ah
 Uljahn: you can beat gold with two runners though
 Thorcode: really?
 Thorcode: how?
 Jerrasterix: both powered by Montecarlo 
 Uljahn: reflex agent almost ignoring the opponent is enough 
 Uljahn: my two runner bot is around top330 in legend and sometimes misses checkpoints while drifting :upside_down:
 Thorcode: uow
 Thorcode: wwow

 kavishka: can you guys tell me a question to ask, when someone presenting one of these game codes
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 tell a question to ask
 Automaton2000: yeah i'm still in silver
 ZakL: ah ok. well im much
 kavishka: can you 
 struct: you mean from multiplayers?
 kavishka: no when someone [reseting one of these game coding a question to ask 
 kavishka: *preseting
 5DN1L: Are you able to come up with any yourself?
 struct: so if I present you a problem, you will ask questions?
 kavishka: no still thinking 
 struct: This is what you mena right?=
 struct: mean*
 kavishka: yes
 kavishka: after you present i need to ask some question like on a presentation 
 struct: so you ask questions related to the code?
 kavishka: yes
 struct: Depends on the puzzle
 jacek: print("hello world"). any questions?
 iBug: HAHAHA
 kavishka: haha
 iBug: I having a question 
 kavishka: tell
 5DN1L: It's easier if you can find some real codes and rehearse. guess it's difficult to come up with questions without anything to base on
 iBug: How to learn english
 iBug: my english so bad
 kavishka: like power of thor 
 5DN1L: yeah
 iBug: Fuck byeÔºÅ I'm going to eat dinner
 iBug: thanks guys
 jacek: oO
 5DN1L: how random
 iBug: you thinked
 5DN1L: thought
 iBug: you can have a random 
 5DN1L: The feeling that you know every single word yet you don't understand the entire sentence...
 jacek: Automaton2000 what is RNN?
 Automaton2000: astrobytes do you use bitboards
 Uljahn: Automaton2000 what is GCN?
 Automaton2000: i'm too lazy to check if the next checkpoint
 5DN1L: That's why Automaton2000 is still in silver lol
 Automaton2000: idk how to use the same rules
 AlkhilJohn.: wait is AUtomaton2000 a bot
 Automaton2000: you can do what you can do on cg
 AlkhilJohn.: ok
 AlkhilJohn.: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: cant wait for the contest
 AlkhilJohn.: Automaton2000 bot
 Automaton2000: just to get the hang of it
 AlkhilJohn.: fucking Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i have an idea what to do
 AlkhilJohn.: what
 AlkhilJohn.: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: they both have the same problem
 AlkhilJohn.: ok Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: madknight i have been in a convenient format ffs...
 5DN1L: No spamming
 AlkhilJohn.: yeah bloody bot
 DialFrost: lol
 5DN1L: You wanna be kicked again?
 AlkhilJohn.: no
 AlkhilJohn.: I think Automaton is a bot
 AlkhilJohn.: Wait who here is and isn't a bot
 DialFrost: &lt;33 guess
 5DN1L: Just don't spam, ok?
 AlkhilJohn.: ok
 AlkhilJohn.: Automaton2000 who programmed you
 Automaton2000: makes me want to puke
 AlkhilJohn.: ahhh scuff that damn bot Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i mean, i don't have any idea what the problem is that
 TonWnachai: :heart:
 DialFrost: automaton2000 wassup
 Automaton2000: what do you mean by that
 AlkhilJohn.: automaton2000 yo how ya doin in the bot world
 Automaton2000: but i agree it would be interesting
 ninjadip: kill all humans
 AlkhilJohn.: ;kill humans
 ninjadip: i mean bots
 AlkhilJohn.: ok
 ninjadip: lol
 ninjadip: i just started the pod racing yesterday, man it's really fun for anyone who hasn't tried it
 xyz-1: Agree, there could be more bots like this
 derjack: there is 'single player' search race

 5DN1L: :smirk:
 DavisZ: yes man, dont know how to @ people here, when i share, i can what happened, but when the coding page is opened i cant
 5DN1L: You just type their name to @
 paracoxat: i exist
 5DN1L: DavisZ Try refreshing the page first?
 DavisZ: lol... i guess it helped...
 5DN1L: Great&#160;:)
 DavisZ: ty
 humanbeethoven: o[p
 5DN1L: humanbeethoven, first warning, please stop spamming, or you‚Äôll be kicked out
 Wontonimo: this is a public chat.  be respectful, no spamming, generally stay on top and generally keep conversation to coding or codingame
 Wontonimo: *topic (not top) lol
 Wontonimo: stay on top also, it's all about the leaderboard
 5DN1L: i've kept my stock phrases in a doc lol
 Wontonimo: i used to do that, but for shot ones I just type it.  it's good typing practice.  but now my keyboard is sticky and dying ...
 5DN1L: indeed, shot for short
 Jerrasterix: did you write any java code recently&#160;??
 Wontonimo: :emoji-of-waving-fist:
 Wontonimo: yeah
 paracoxat: i exist
 Jerrasterix: That's the cause of your sticky code ...
 paracoxat:&#160;:()
 Jerrasterix: *keyboard 
 5DN1L: you won't exist if you keep typing that paracoxat
 Wontonimo: hey paracoxat, no spamming
 paracoxat: LOLOL
 paracoxat: ok
 Jerrasterix: did your org use Log4j Wontonimo&#160;??
 Wontonimo: yeah Jerrasterix, indeed my own keyboard was inspiration for making that contribution
 Wontonimo: yeah, we use log4j.
 Jerrasterix: Are you guys still using it or what&#160;??
 humanbeethoven: so sending more than 1 message is considered spamming huh
 Jerrasterix: if its not on topic 
 Jerrasterix: Then YES
 Wontonimo: yeah we are still using it.  i'm not sure what the plan is Jerrasterix
 Jerrasterix: Okay, now does a bot programming animation need JS&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: in CG 
 Jerrasterix: I am planning to do one&#160;:)
 DavisZ: in pod racing, why my pod is like 3x on one point? while boss has no lag with points...
 Wontonimo: yeah, unless you do something really weird with CSS transitions, i think js is the only front end option Jerrasterix
 Wontonimo: share a replay link DavisZ

 Wontonimo: DavisZ , it looks like you are probably printing twice per round
 Jerrasterix: probably an Ultimate version, if I can 
 Wontonimo: just print once per round
 DavisZ: ty
 Wontonimo: look at the debug print output on the left hand side and verrify that the output is what you expect
 Wontonimo: i see "100" then "Boost" alternating
 DavisZ: yea, i tried to implement 2 ifs in there what changes printed output depending on dist or angle, ill work on it
 Wontonimo: * hint&#160;: in the if's set variables.  Then after all the if's use ONE print to print the values
 DavisZ: yea, it makes perfect sense why thrust was string before :D 
 CaptainHenryAvery: lol
 CaptainHenryAvery: who said coding was that hard
 CaptainHenryAvery: xd
 CaptainHenryAvery: i look at c# and it like throwing a ball of randome info at me

 Wontonimo: nice, looks like the bug is fixed&#160;!  congrats
 DavisZ: ty, it was because my power was int, and i tried to put BOOST as seperate, not overriding power
 DavisZ: its my first try on these games :D
 Wontonimo: what's your background in prrogramming DavidZ&#160;?
 SupercraftD: /me
 DavisZ: @Wontonimo i just started, im attending quite intense c# courses and now im learnig it for like a month
 DavisZ: @Wontonimo but i havent done any programming before, at courses we did like 2 themes at week, starting from data &amp; variables, moving trhue loops, array, etc, and ending with classes and objects, collections and poly, now kinda waiting testing to start, while have to deal with clash'es ( 250 to reach), reading yellow book and stuff like that
 Wontonimo: very cool.  congrats on entering this new world
 DavisZ: sometimes i have nightmares with infinte loops just running before my eyes :D other than that its pretty awesome
 Wontonimo: lol ... that's just from intensity of study.  pat yourself on the back for being so intense.  Few people can sustain that level
 Wontonimo: if it is your dreams, then your subconscious has finally been convinced that it is important to learn and pay attention to
 Flaise: Yay, got my second legend level achievement. Almost as though I'm some kind of addict or something.
 Sekoia: community addict eh
 Flaise: See what I did there? Wacka, wacka, wacka!
 Wontonimo: seek help Flaise, perhaps a 10 step program.  I suggest getting 10 more legend badges to help your addiction problem
 Flaise: But.. but then I'd stop being a perfect square
 Sekoia: you have 2 legend achievements that's not a perfect square what
 Flaise: Level 16
 Wontonimo: you'll just have to go to level 25
 Wontonimo: sorry
 Wontonimo: I think the levels should have names and be given a dungeon map icon.  Level 1 should be something like "puddle trap".  Level 2 "obvious foot sized hole", level 3 "single slime" , etc
 Wontonimo: instead of being "how many levels you have", it should be more like "how many levels of the coding dungeon you have cleared"
 Flaise: I had a friend look at the quest map on the home screen and he said it looked like Dungeons and Dragons for some reason.
 Wontonimo: he hasn't played D&amp;D imho
 jacek: huh
 Flaise: He has. But I have and I have no idea why he thinks it looks like D&amp;D. xD
 Flaise: You know what would solve my addiction way faster is getting a job :o
 BlaiseEbuth: Faster reach lvl25...
 STALKER_HEART_OF_CHERNOBIL: hi all
 Wontonimo: hi all-1
 Wontonimo: * now everyone is wondering if they are the -1
 5DN1L: -1 is yourself :D
 BlaiseEbuth: You're the only -1 Wontonimo... :smirk:
 Wontonimo: that's right.  to say hi to yourself is a sign of being cray cray
 Wontonimo:  /k√≠ck BlaiseEbuth 
 jacek: go hi yourself
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. That's funny. Thanks for highlighting a little bug Wontonimo. ^^
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/BKnRe0S">https://imgur.com/a/BKnRe0S</a>
 Wontonimo: i put a space infront and changed the i to √≠ to make sure it didn't actually kick you
 Flaise: Hi Flaise.
 Flaise: ...oshit
 Wontonimo: sorry if it wasn't obvious that it was a joke BlaiseEbuth&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: It was... Did I gave you the feeling I took it seriously?
 BlaiseEbuth: I was speaking of the bug on the pic I shared Wontonimo, not of the kick that didn't kick.
 Wontonimo: what's the bug in the pic?
 Wontonimo: oh, was it highlighted in green on your screen?
 BlaiseEbuth: The big ugly green highlight...
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah
 Wontonimo: oh, very interesting.
 Wontonimo:  /will this highlight in green also BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: That's from my script. I changed the color of the notification on the channel tabs, but seems the html class is the same for the hl messages. ^^
 jacek: oh my
 Wontonimo: I decided to use the markov chain contrib I was working on to make chatbot like babble.  Here's some examples of what it made
 Wontonimo: today a man a fire and hell be warm for a small arms dealer.i hear theyre going to give him a glass of water.i failed math so many times at school, i thought, that sounds like a fair trade.the reception was fantastic.
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/4zV6y1K">https://tech.io/snippet/4zV6y1K</a>  it has some chat history and some 1 line jokes hard coded in it
 jacek: is it Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: oh, so it's not so much
 BlaiseEbuth: :D
 Wontonimo: yeah, not so much for sure
 Wontonimo: just a few dozen training phrases hard coded
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: my children need wine Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: need to check for the next
 SupercraftD: i just passed the python certification! finallllyyy!!
 ninjadip: nice
 ninjadip: curious are you learning on your own or in school or what
 SupercraftD: on my own
 BlaiseEbuth: Ye! Another one is  better than &gt;99% of the professionals&#160;!
 SupercraftD: how accurate is that rating :sweat_smile:
 BlaiseEbuth: -INF approximately
 ninjadip: they've done studies: 80% of the time, it works every time
 SupercraftD: huh
 SupercraftD: cool
 ninjadip: a joke... lol a logic joke. from a movie
 ninjadip: you failed if you didn't get it
 SupercraftD: oh
 SupercraftD: i didnt get it
 d4rkAi: xD
 ninjadip: 80 percent of the time it works every time...
 SupercraftD: :frowning2:
 ninjadip: you don't get it
 ninjadip:&#160;?
 SupercraftD: oh
 SupercraftD: now i get it
 SupercraftD: I speedread it
 SupercraftD: first time
 SupercraftD: now I get it
 zakacat: congrats on passing the cert
 zakacat: who did you go thru?
 SupercraftD: wdym
 Wontonimo: this site
 SupercraftD: who?
 Wontonimo: he means he passed the certification here on CG
 zakacat: Right, okay, gotcha
 SupercraftD: ohh
 BlaiseEbuth: Wontonimo I need a ping \o/
 Wontonimo: ping BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah! That works. Thx
 Wontonimo:  /k√≠ck ing the tires for BlaiseEbuth
 zakacat: lol
 zakacat: Is there an autoformat hotkey I can use for my garb-code?
 Sekoia: oh my god python is so easy
 Sekoia: I keep winning clashes now
 Dren: lol
 Dren: clearly you haven't run into many ruby coders
 Dren: like Alecman
 Wontonimo: yeah, zakacat: try using [ctrl]-a then [del]
 BeBopping: In Clash of Code, I'd love to be able to continue working on a problem after the clash has completed. Does that seem like a good feature request?
 zakacat: lmao
 5DN1L: BeBopping what you said was also mentioned in this chat many times before&#160;:)
 jacek: :O
 BeBopping: What has the response been? Is it a good request? Is there some other place I should be posting the feature request? Thx.
 jacek: forums or discord. but it has been suggested many times i think
 jacek: as alternative you can search for that clash and complete on your own <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 BeBopping: How do I search for the puzzle using the information from the results screen? I don't see a title or a link or any other useful info. Even just having a link to the puzzle from the results screen would be satisfactory.
 Sekoia: Dren I'm counting "winning 50% of the time" as "keep winning" :P
 Sekoia: If I see somebody using Ruby or something less conventional, generally I know I'm not gonna get it cus those people are insane
 5DN1L: BeBopping you'll have to remember some words from the clash in order to search
 BeBopping: Thanks 5DN1L. It's nice that we at least have the ability to find the puzzles, but it seems like a pretty bad UX. Simply having a title and link available from the results page doesn't sound difficult to do, and it seems like it is a popular feature request. Is there a recommended way to get the dev's attention with this suggestion? Are Forums/Discord the most successful routes, or something else?
 5DN1L: that search function is not even developed by CG :upside_down:
 5DN1L: i mean the link given by jacek
 5DN1L: both the forum and discord are read by CG staff
 BeBopping: Very true. But there may be a simple solution that uses existing CG functionality. Surely CG has an interest in improving their platform. I'll try the forum and discord, then.
 5DN1L: BeBopping For the forum, you may read through this post first to see if anybody has raised the suggestion before. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/clash-of-code-bugs-improvement/833">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/clash-of-code-bugs-improvement/833</a>
 5DN1L: If not, you may post a suggestion there. Better not start a new thread
 BeBopping: thx 5DN1L
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 jacek: "Surely CG has an interest in improving their platform" :rofl:
 5DN1L: if and when an improvement can at the same time improve their profitability perhaps?
 jacek: shall i suggest them to add ads to clashes? :imp:
 5DN1L: you can't start the clash until everyone has watched the ad :joy:
 BeBopping: lol
 Wontonimo: they are at their heart a head-hunting company which operates on a very short sales cycle.  Software and product dev is a long sales cycle.  There is a conflict right there and the short cycle will trump the long cycle 99/100 times
 Wontonimo: i bet CG is seen as a lead generation tool for them, and funding and priority is set according to how many dev leads they can get.
 jacek: any tool to draw simple NN with labeled edges?
 Wontonimo: what kind of labels?  the weights?
 BlaiseEbuth:  "Surely CG has an interest in improving their platform" :rofl: 
 jacek: more like weights names
 jacek: i think for xor example ill draw it myself
 Wontonimo: how would weights have names&#160;?
 jacek: im doing this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/14705d9666eec05d31493ca3c54ff10d13695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs">https://tech.io/playgrounds/14705d9666eec05d31493ca3c54ff10d13695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Following your own tuto?
 jacek: so the images would be 3 layers: inputs nodes, hidden nodes and output node. and there would be w1,w2,b1 etc. labels
 Wontonimo: you don't want to use numpy&#160;?
 jacek: plus i dont know if i got the backprop right there. 
 Wontonimo: or an array&#160;?
 jacek: i want the simplest simple. numpy obscures things imo
 picoplankton: what is the secret sauce to solving don't panic in &lt;200 chars; I feel like I'm missing something. 250 is as low as i can go in python...
 Wontonimo: imo a matrix IS the weights.  not using a matrix is obscuring the situation
 5DN1L: picoplankton <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/dont-panic-episode-1-codesize-puzzle-discussion/686">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/dont-panic-episode-1-codesize-puzzle-discussion/686</a>
 jacek: well the array example will be on next page
 Wontonimo: cool cool
 jacek: but when i write this thing once again, it quite often diverges or not converges enough
 jacek: when i changed derror = error * sigmoid_prime(output) into derror = error, then it converges faster
 picoplankton: @5DN1L yea; i've looked at that thread. It suggests I need to not use python, but i see others have successfully done it.  its the input lines that eat me alive on this one.
 jacek: but we always update according to derivative no?
 Wontonimo: yes, because the random uniform is HUGE
 5DN1L: picoplankton I think that thread does mention some python tricks?
 Wontonimo: and there is no guarantee that you have a good spread of + and - values 
 BlaiseEbuth: picoplankton <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/clemg/pythongolfer">https://github.com/clemg/pythongolfer</a>
 Wontonimo: jacek , try setting the b random values to be -0.1 to +0.1
 jacek: oh right, changed to -0.1, 0.1 and it works better
 Wontonimo: may as well make that a variable/const at the top VARIANCE = 0.1
 Wontonimo: I'd also suggest changing if (i+1)&#160;% 1000 == 0:to if (i &lt; 1000 and i%100 == 0) or i%1000 == 0:
 Wontonimo: and change the range from range(10000)
 Wontonimo: to range(1,10001)
 jacek: mhm
 picoplankton: i see the cheat sheet; hadn't noticed it before
 jacek: and now it almost never converges&#160;:?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48803546-cc01-4222-a8ea-19991bb73abf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48803546-cc01-4222-a8ea-19991bb73abf</a>
 picoplankton: still -- this is a stupid exercise.  I used to hire programmers and anyone who would have handed code into me like this, would have been off my team faster than they could type an if statement...
 jacek: you dont use code golfing at work? :O
 jacek: then how do you save HDD space
 picoplankton: god no&#160;! i'm not a programmer, but I need to be able to read the code
 picoplankton: if its not readable, its useless
 picoplankton: i dont' want anyone on my team who can't write readable code just to feel smart
 jacek: ahh learning rate 0.1 too small, need to make 0.3 or more ~
 picoplankton: its not 1995 anymore; we don't have to conserve disk space writing code&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: jacek here are the changes i've made that make it converge nearly all the time <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/50I9jyN">https://tech.io/snippet/50I9jyN</a>
 jacek: nice!
 jacek: thanks
 Wontonimo: variance_W = 0.5 , variance_b = 0.1 , alpha = 0.2
 jacek: mind if i put them
 Wontonimo: please do!
 5DN1L: picoplankton hmmm, I thought it was mentioned in the thread but i can't find it. one non-language-specific trick: use just one line for reading inputs. Not three lines.
 5DN1L: one while loop for everything
 picoplankton: that isn't to say that shorter code can't be more readable
 picoplankton: @5DN1L I don't see how, since one fo the readlines is in a loop and needs to be done more than once
 5DN1L: but you can tailor based on some specific characteristic of the inputs
 Wontonimo: i see what you mean by naming Jacek.  I'd rename w1-w6 to be w11 , w12 , w13 , w21 w22 ...
 jacek: yeah, i saw examples with those as well
 Wontonimo: it will help when transitioning to matrix
 Wontonimo: because then it is w[1][2] for w12 :D
 jacek: i meant to draw something like that <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/725/7258c8b8-1984-4591-b65b-8b23b0b6f9f5/phpQ2IYQz.png">https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/725/7258c8b8-1984-4591-b65b-8b23b0b6f9f5/phpQ2IYQz.png</a>
 Husoski: picoplankton Code golf is not application programming.  So what's the beef?
 picoplankton: i don't see how its useful; all it teaches you is how to write unreadable code
 Husoski: You wouldn't want your limo driver to drive like a NASCAR driver, right?  (But you might want him to have some of those skills just in case.)
 picoplankton: never teach things that develop bad habits
 Wontonimo: no, it teaches you to come up with a different way of coding a problem then what you are used to.  
 5DN1L: I agree with Wontonimo
 jacek: and to write chinese in python scripts
 Wontonimo: I learn new language features when looking at really good golfs.
 picoplankton: i'm not a coder, I guess; i'm very results oriented. I need to get the job done and move on; and I need to be able to come back a year later and interpret it
 Husoski: jacek ROFL
 jacek: oh right, you can try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a> for you solution!
 Husoski: *ROFFL
 Wontonimo: it's not Mandarin, it's just random unicode.  :unamused:
 picoplankton: ergo; i would never hire someone who can't give me code I can't read.  The stuff i have to produce to reduce the code size is not readable; even by me a few weeks later
 picoplankton: perl is like mandarin to me....
 5DN1L: picoplankton new language features from code golf ‚â† unreadable code
 5DN1L: it depends how you apply them
 5DN1L: on*
 Wontonimo: how about a programming who takes 20 lines to do something in 2 readable lines?  golf isn't just about obfuscation, it is about simplicity
 Dren: yeah they are unreadable because you don't engage with it
 picoplankton: I agree
 picoplankton: if it makes is clearer i'm all for it
 struct: all my bots are codegolfed
 Wontonimo: then just focus on that picoplankton.  you don't have to do what others say, you can play the code golf by your own rules
 picoplankton: and on something thats 200 chars, thats probably OK, but if I have a script of 5000 lines, i'm not sure its a good idea
 picoplankton: when you have a team 
 picoplankton: and the team changes over time
 jacek: its just for competition. i dont see any practical use for code golfing either
 picoplankton: and is composed of students who are learning
 jacek: except maybe to find some clever tricks
 struct: I learned coding from reading the 1kb chess engine
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://vole.wtf/kilobytes-gambit/">https://vole.wtf/kilobytes-gambit/</a>
 Uljahn: i agree with jacek, nobody tells you to use codegolf in real projects, it's just an exercise for improving your understanding of a language
 picoplankton: i think there are better ways to do that... just my 2c
 5DN1L: fair enough, everybody has his/her own learning preference
 Uljahn: whatever floats your bot, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this time i have to look at the time
 Wontonimo: wow struct, that is a really cool 1kb of code.  like, wow.  Thanks for sharing
 jacek: it wont fit into CG liimit&#160;:(
 jacek: Automaton2000 did you kill the chat
 Automaton2000: my ai is really bad
 Wontonimo: hey jacek, I added a very rudimentery L2 constraint to your NN and now you don't need to deal with the variance thing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/UXdpSnf">https://tech.io/snippet/UXdpSnf</a>
 Wontonimo: from lines 49 to 60, this constrains the weights to not explode
 Wontonimo: which is what was happening to your previous NNs
 jacek: oO
 jacek: whats 25
 Wontonimo: but a MUCH better implementation would be to include it in the backprop as a derivative 
 Wontonimo: 25 is 5*5
 Wontonimo: it just caps the weights out at about +5/-5
 Wontonimo: if you change it to 2*2 then it will cap the weight at +2/-2
 jacek: nice
 struct: jacek is already unstoppable&#160;:( 
 jacek: but is regularization neccessary if you have 100% data set :thinking:
 Sekoia: coding speed level Legend complete
 jacek: :tada:
 Wontonimo: yes, because regularization helps your NN not explode from gradient descent 
 Wontonimo: and it will train faster
 Wontonimo: in the link is sent with regularization, the NN is good after 3,000 training steps instead of 10,000
 jacek: i was thinking to just show snippsets with short explanations
 jacek: first example with bunch of variables, second with array and customizable hidden size, third with momentum
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah.  i didn't mean to derail your techio thing.  i just thought you'd be interested in the regularization thing.
 jacek:&#160;:+1:

 jacek: a brief tutorial on NN to freshen my mind
 Schwase: NN = neural network?

 Alexander97: Hey guys
 Alexander97: I need help :D
 Alexander97: For the ASCII Art puzzle
 Alexander97: I`m doing it in C
 Alexander97: anyone interested?

 5DN1L: "anyone interested" doesn't count :smirk:
 Alexander97: Well I Wrote an algorithm that Works for printing a Whole sentence but if there is an space or a symbol I just don`t understand hoW to make it print the symbol/space
 struct: check the char code of the char
 Alexander97: It is something tricky that I can`t comprehend probably
 Alexander97: What I need is somebody to look at the code
 struct: sure, paste it here
 struct: to get the char code you can simply do
 struct: char c = 'a';int val = (int)c;
 struct: in this case val should be 97
 Alexander97: it is not that simple, a calculations must be done
 Flaise: And noW for the pertinent question: What I Want to knoW is Why you're capitalizing all your Ws, Alexander97.
 Alexander97: because the input may different ASCII

 Flaise: oh ok haha
 Alexander97: and it works on al the tests exept 06 and 04 which are man hat tan and m@nh@tt@n
 5DN1L: I'm not making fun of you, but splitting Manhattan as man hat tan is funny :P
 Alexander97: haha LOL :D I wrote it in a coincidence
 Alexander97: Hmm  I don`t know how to say it 
 Alexander97: In English
 Alexander97: How do you say for example that what you just did is a coincidence
 Alexander97: [offtopic]
 5DN1L: by chance?
 Wontonimo: cowinkydink
 Alexander97: aah okay
 Alexander97: Hey there wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hey hey Alexander97
 5DN1L: I just convert each char to its ascii value in my solution
 5DN1L: same as what struct suggested
 Alexander97: but each char is already on it`s value right?
 5DN1L: then subtract a constant based on which range the ascii value lies
 5DN1L: to convert ascii value to the location (index) of the new representation
 5DN1L: if outside the ascii value range of A-Z and a-z becomes the constant which represents the index of "?"
 struct: yeah you can even do an if to check the char range
 struct: if((T[k] &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; T[k] &lt;= 'z') || (T[k] &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; T[k] &lt;= 'Z'))
 struct: you do what you are currently doing
 struct: else you need to print the last "char" of the array they give you
 struct: I think its a&#160;?
 Alexander97: I am so tired and confused that I can`t even understand what is going on. Sorry about that
 5DN1L: Maybe you can copy our comments first, take a break, and read them later? :wink:
 Alexander97: That is exactly what I was thinking to do
 5DN1L:&#160;:)

 Alexander97: However I really thank you for the assistance and I deeply appreciate it &lt;3
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 TimothyAlexisVass: Solve the following puzzle to prove that you are not a :sailboat:
 Alexander97: I know I am not and I will really solve it
 Alexander97: By the way what does it exactly mean somebody to be a boat? :D
 Wontonimo: i've never heard that before
 5DN1L: Neither have I
 Wontonimo: perhaps he meant bot
 Wontonimo: :bot:
 Wontonimo: :robot:
 Wontonimo: :rowboat:
 Alexander97: lol :D
 Wontonimo: robot = :robot:rowboat = :rowboat:boat = :boat:
 Wontonimo: :sailboat: sailboat?
 Alexander97: like sailing bot?
 Alexander97: lol dunno
 Wontonimo: i was thinking of making a sailing bot battle
 Alexander97: what would it look like
 MyMonkey: how different from Coders of the Carribean would it be&#160;?
 Wontonimo: top down like mad pod racing. physics based.  you have control of your sheet and rudder and daggerboard
 Wontonimo: what's coders of the carribean now called?
 5DN1L: Galleon Wars
 Wontonimo: there would be a current, sailing rules like right of way
 Wontonimo: and somewhat slightly changing winds
 darkhorse64: More like a race with "maritime" physics, stealing wind&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 darkhorse64: Interesting
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: all the big CG twitch guys have quit, I wonder why
 darkhorse64: No cannon&#160;? :disappointed:
 Alexander97: CANT BELIVE IT. Just noticed that it was expecting me to type&#160;? for space and @ 
 Alexander97: Not actually the real ' ' and '@'
 struct: thats what I said Alexander97
 Alexander97: 5DN1L Thank you!
 Alexander97: And struct
 Alexander97: yea just I couldnt get it for some reason
 BlaiseEbuth: big cg twitch guys&#160;?

 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: i guess that is true 
 BlaiseEbuth: Public earning issues probably... :smirk:
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: i used java but it is still saying in my profile that "No programming languages used yet"
 5DN1L: You have to solve a puzzle in that language first
 Wontonimo: you have to solve puzzles
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: ah okay 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: i solved one but not completly 
 Wontonimo: 100% or nada.
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: okay 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: thank you again wonto&#160;:)
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: can somebody gives me some tips on how i can pass a technical assesment in java for an internship&#160;? 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: got a 246 / 1146 on my java assesment that i did today&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: what things did you do poorly on&#160;?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I doubt they generate new material for the assessment.  Just solve all puzzles first
 Alexander97: All puzzles? Bud i`ll get old if I do that first
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: haha 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: but yea i need more practice i guess
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: wish me luck guys 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: need to get that internship 
 5DN1L: Good luck!
 Alexander97: finally did it
 Alexander97: just the statement should be if out of range the char to be == to 104 so it prints the&#160;?
 Alexander97: Thank you again 5DN1L and struct
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 5DN1L: What's 104?
 Wontonimo: 13*8
 Wontonimo: jk
 5DN1L: :smirk: don't spam :smirk:
 Alexander97: lol wontonimo.5DN1L it is a position for starting point of printing&#160;?
 5DN1L: I dunno, you mentioned 104
 Alexander97: However it doesnt work on the last test for other ascii
 Alexander97: DEM
 Wontonimo: what lang are you using Alexander97&#160;?
 Alexander97: wontonimo C
 Wontonimo: you can useint x = '?'&#160;; to get the ascii right?
 Alexander97: nono it is about a position of and array
 5DN1L: The statement does mention "The characters that are not in the intervals [a-z] or [A-Z] will be shown as a question mark in ASCII art."
 Alexander97: that gets an input and I print it every row
 Wontonimo: sorry i wasn't following, link to puzzle plz
 5DN1L: ASCII Art
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/ascii-art">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/ascii-art</a>
 Alexander97: 5DN1L yeah I see. How can I enter the max size but not the whole of an array which has a lot of empty elements
 5DN1L: max size?
 Alexander97: I haven`t learn that. I`ll give a look
 5DN1L:&#160;???
 5DN1L: I don't understand what you're asking
 Alexander97: The array is 1025 but it is filled lets say up to 300
 Alexander97: and the rest are just 0
 Alexander97: so I have to find that 300 value
 Alexander97: one option is via for loop, is there other simpler way to do so?
 Wontonimo: make a variable to keep track of it
 Alexander97: My god I have done that but forgot to use id somehou
 jacek: sacre bleu indeed
 jacek: chess eh, kovi
 picoplankton: i really don't get the 200 char solution for don't panic
 picoplankton: 251 is as good as i get
 picoplankton: i gained 1 character via the suggested 'cheat sheet'
 picoplankton: but i feel like i'm missing something about the logic
 picoplankton: cause i have no idea how to shorten this by 51 characters -  v=int(q[0])
 Schwase: in python?
 picoplankton: yes
 Schwase: thats not your whole code
 Schwase: but i have it at 198 now
 picoplankton: no
 picoplankton: its not
 picoplankton: but its the logic; everying else is input etc, whcih you can't really shorten any
 Schwase: yes
 Schwase: you definitely can
 5DN1L: you can get away with using input() just once in the whole code, as I told you earlier
 Schwase: you can also alias input
 Schwase: I=input
 Schwase: I() is the same as input()
 Schwase: or use definitions
 Schwase: theres plenty of things you can do
 5DN1L: When I say using input() once, I don't mean aliasing, I mean really just once :joy:
 Schwase: yeah but learning some basic python code golf tricks will be helpful
 Schwase: the code right now still has plenty of golfing improvements that could be made
 5DN1L: agreed
 5DN1L: i'm making progress very very very slooooooowly
 Schwase: oooh
 Schwase: the interval thing
 5DN1L: in the forum thread?
 picoplankton: i see no way to have just one input function when there are three inputs, two of which are in loops
 5DN1L: you have to be creative :P
 Schwase: just to be clear, we aren't discussing any hardcoded solutions right? just things based on the statement/constraints?
 picoplankton: i tried the aliasing thing; but somehow it didn't work
 jacek: oO
 5DN1L: if the inputs are "x x x x x x x x" do a; elif the inputs are "x x" do b; else do c
 Schwase: oh
 Schwase: so yes, hardcoded?
 5DN1L: no
 Schwase: oh ok
 5DN1L: just visualising
 5DN1L: i have no hardcode at all
 Schwase: yeah just making sure we're discussing the same thing
 ninjadip: something about input
 5DN1L: yes something about a certainty property of the input
 5DN1L: which distinguishes the three what-to-do-next
 Schwase: yep
 Schwase: so thats each turn?
 5DN1L: so you can use one while loop, then if-elif-else
 Schwase: do you not use the initialization input??
 ninjadip: should it be hard to get out of silver league in pod racing
 5DN1L: it's also inside the while loop
 ninjadip: changed the entire logic from a table of reference values to formulas, and it's not as good
 picoplankton: you can get out of silver in pod racing with a little physics
 ninjadip: yeah that's what i'm tryin to do. wish i wouldn't have cheated to pass calc now
 jacek: -3vel
 picoplankton: na; don't even need calc; just consider drift
 jacek: [solved]
 ninjadip: do u think it's best to slow down before checkpoints if the velocity is high or to just keep the speed?
 ninjadip: that's what i'm workin on
 ninjadip: I wish i knew the location of the next checkpoint to drift accordingly
 ninjadip: i meant the next next location
 ninjadip: lol
 picoplankton: There are a couple of things i had to do, if I remember correctly, and yes, modulating speed is one of them
 picoplankton: yupp; need to track those
 ninjadip: that's what i was thinking
 ninjadip: one bad lap to learn all the points
 picoplankton: but you don't know them on the first round
 ninjadip: exactly
 ninjadip: that's in my todo list
 picoplankton: it only helps you on teh second and third round
 picoplankton: i found that considering drift made much more of a difference
 picoplankton: but both mattered to get me to gold, i think
 ninjadip: yeah i'm considering it alright
 ninjadip: lol
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: i am having some issues in the Don't panic episode 1 , can't pass the test Few rounds 
 ninjadip: i'm trying to find that sweet spot of when and how much to slow down before checkpoints
 ninjadip: whats that game about?
 ninjadip: i'm super new to this
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: yea me too 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: super new 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: like 2 days ago new 
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: that kind of new 
 ninjadip: my first game is this pod racing, and i'm hooked. got to silver in a day
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: nice 
 ninjadip: whats the problem
 jacek: pod racing, that brings some memories ~
 TheLovelyBrocolli_ff63: Don't panic game is about getting the robots to the exit point ninjadip 
 picoplankton: 237 on Don't Panic with aliasing....
 picoplankton: its personal now
 jacek: have you tried the chinese characters trick yet
 picoplankton:&#160;?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 Schwase: wtf
 5DN1L: I don't use that and is at 147.
 picoplankton: omg
 picoplankton: seriously
 jacek: try to use that and see how much you can get
 Schwase: gotta love ascii haha
 5DN1L: 99. not submitting that though :D
 jacek: oO
 picoplankton: OMG
 picoplankton: 144
 picoplankton: that's cheating&#160;!
 jacek: :tada:
 picoplankton: and really gets my juices going about unreadable code
 5DN1L: I'll continue to work on shortening my 147 instead :P
 jacek: it's really readable :v
 picoplankton: how the heck does this even work&#160;?
 Schwase: its ascii
 Schwase: you can go to Q&amp;A
 jacek: maybe its cheating but if you only care about the quest, whats wrong
 Husoski: If this is about the Python .encode() hack, I've already posted my complaints on the forums and discord.  The whole issue goes away if they counted source code bytes instead of Unicode code points.
 Schwase: also its the same as the issue of hardcoding
 Schwase: theres no way to stop someone from getting the top scores using it, so its unfair to grandstand about it when other players will use it to get ahead
 Husoski: I don't see that.  Hardcoding requires knowing the answer in advance, doesn't it?
 Astrobytes: I think Schwase refers to hardcoding validators in the optims
 Schwase: it definitely used to happen in code golf puzzles as well however
 Astrobytes: (i.e solve offline and hardcode the solution for each validator)
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think they changed them since though
 Astrobytes: and do regular reruns/changes
 Schwase: yeah i was looking into that, i kind of came to that conclusion
 Schwase: bulls and cows 2 is randomized for example
 Astrobytes: Yep. Some optims are designed to be done offline as well
 Husoski: Randomized input would fix that, but I guess the framework isn't set up for that.  I've only authored one clash, so I'm pretty new at that.
 Astrobytes: I'm not a clash fan&#160;:)
 Husoski: Sometimes it's fun.  If players are willing to share and talk over solutions it can be good.
 AntiSquid: oh thor has some new validators to go north&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah totally, just my personal preference&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Since a while I think AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: *while ago
 Schwase: 4 validators is sooo short still
 Astrobytes: it's designed to be simple I believe
 Flaise: I don't like clash much either
 Flaise: Ironic that it's my best ranking out of all the categories.
 Astrobytes: heh heh, well it decays pretty fast so don't get too attached to it :D
 Flaise: I'm forcing myself to keep playing one round per day, at least, so that I can get to the next step on my quest map.
 Astrobytes: *the points decay pretty fast
 Astrobytes: lol, that quest map :D
 Astrobytes: I skipped the clash path hehe
 Flaise: If the next step of the path is like 100 clashes, 250 clashes, I'm just gonna say fuck it, I'm done. But I placed very well right off the bat, which kept me going this far. But it sucks because now it feels like there's nowhere for me to go but down.
 Astrobytes: It's something like that yeah. I'm not sure since I stopped at "win 2 clashes" or something
 Flaise: Ah, not even that interested? I don't blame you. They feel dumb.
 Astrobytes: I prefer Bot &amp; Optim
 Schwase: i only have the bot programming pathway left to complete
 Schwase: im at the get top 2% part
 Flaise: Yeesh, the path gets really demanding at the end..
 Flaise: I wonder if a bot contest with only wood league and none of the other leagues would count
 Astrobytes: iirc it's only official ex-contest multis that count (ie. Wood -&gt; Legend
 Astrobytes: )
 Flaise: Makes me feel like I've wasted time on at least two of the bots I've written.
 Astrobytes: There is no such thing as wasting time on bot programming unless you just sit and stare at the IDE&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: The Quest Map isn't everything. And you learned some tricks doing the bots you did so far
 Flaise: I think the knowledge I learned along the way is I suck at minimax programming.
 Astrobytes: you're using alpha-beta pruning right?
 AntiSquid: it's all about the friends you made along the way
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AntiSquid: didn't see the person who said that on here in years btw
 Astrobytes: was that inoryy?
 Flaise: I'm not using alpha-beta pruning. I may go back and add that later. But I think the thing that's killing my AI is I may have gotten the position score evaluation wrong.
 AntiSquid: forgot their name
 Astrobytes: You're gonna need a/b pruning on CG for sure, with these time limit constraints
 Or64bit: Guys any idea why the pod racing animation does not run? I mean the console logs everything and one of the two pods wins, but the screen is frozen for the entire animation
 Astrobytes: refresh
 Astrobytes: it's a pixi.js thing
 Or64bit: Thanks :D
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Speaking of JS, did you try out BitBurner properly yet?
 AntiSquid: forgot it existed
 Astrobytes: heheheh
 AntiSquid: Offline for 2 days 23 minutes 5 seconds. While you were offline, your scripts generated $0.000, your Hacknet Nodes generated $0.000 and you gained 0.000 reputation divided amongst your factions.
 Astrobytes: that's cause you didn't do anything :P
 Flaise: Congratulations on not losing anything? :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 GamingGnawer: I am trying to solve the puzzle Treasure hunt
 GamingGnawer: and my code solves 5/6 cases
 GamingGnawer: but on the largest test i get a very wierd response
 GamingGnawer: I had half expected to run out of time
 GamingGnawer: but it resolves fine, just gets the answer a few billions off the mark
 AntiSquid: there 4billion dollars
 GamingGnawer: I'm tasked to find as much gold as possible,they expect 39. but I make it out with 589504547
 GamingGnawer: you'ld think they'd be happy ;P
 Flaise: (You're supposed to pocket the difference, you amateur.)
 Astrobytes: hah!
 GamingGnawer: :grimacing:
 GamingGnawer: :laughing:
 GamingGnawer: if (gold &gt; expected)pocket += gold - expected
 flakerimi: what is the matrix
 AntiSquid: a rectangular array or table of numbers which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object flakerimi
 flakerimi: @AntiSquid Trinity: The answer is out there, Neo, and it's looking for you, and it will find you if you want it to.&#160;:)
 Flaise: When I do graphics programming, I enter lots of little matrices. Not this one big matrix; that's silly.
 AntiSquid: i read the leaked plot, it was horrible flakerimi
 AntiSquid: should have ended with first movie, which was a masterpiece for its time
 flakerimi: people on twitter: I love matrix, people gonna hate it
 AntiSquid: the 2 sequels were bad
 Flaise: I saw the second one and it was :S meeeehhhh
 flakerimi: I disagree
 AntiSquid: well in that case i guess you watched resurrections and liked it&#160;?#
 Perler: &lt;3 u all
 Astrobytes: Matrix sequel was ooookayyyy but not a patch on the first imo. They should have left it alone, I agree.
 AntiSquid: on a scale from "better watch a different movie"  all the way up to  "i should do something else instead" where do you think this sequel fits best?
 flakerimi: Still. maybe tomorrow
 Astrobytes: (by sequel I mean Reloaded)
 AntiSquid: ah .. well the 3rd sequel just came out yesterday (15 mins past midnight here)
 Astrobytes: not sure I'm gonna bother with it tbh unless I hear unexpectedly good things 
 AntiSquid: well i watched Bill and Ted 3 and it felt depressing
 flakerimi: you have to watch it as whole
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Oh damn dude, I caught about 20 minutes of that and turned it off, what a total wreck
 flakerimi: you cannot watch lord of the rings 1
 flakerimi: also its subjective too
 AntiSquid: flakerimi who says i didn't watch them all&#160;?
 Astrobytes: everything is subjective
 Astrobytes: anyway, gotta run, take care and gn all
 AntiSquid: i don't like the sequels, you seem to very enthusiastic about fixing someone else's opinion about a movie they don't like but you like :joy:
 AntiSquid: gn8
 flakerimi: nah, I am not trying that
 flakerimi: just expressing what I thing
 flakerimi: think
 ninjadip: omg the new bill and ted is the worst!
 flakerimi: I havent seen even old one
 ninjadip: if the first one is 100, the old sequel is like an 80 or 90 and the new one is like a 10 or 20
 ninjadip: those are my apples
 ninjadip: believe it or not the first one set some new time travel precedents and rules
 flakerimi: I like to see new matrix, from Wachowski Sisters perspective, first 3 was from brothers&#160;:)
 ninjadip: like how if you have a time machine, you can just say or think "hey i'll go in the future and bring back a million bucks to the me standing here" and blam! it's movie magic and time travel history
 ninjadip: finally getting somewhere in the pods silver league
 flakerimi: good night guys, off to watch 'Sorry'
 Wontonimo: hey ninjadip , how goes silver league?
 ZXC01: hi!
 Wontonimo: hey ZXC01 , how's it goin?
 ZXC01: great
 Wontonimo: i'm looking at your replays ninjadip <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/598530684">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/598530684</a> and can see that your pod isn't slowing down as it is getting close to the checkpoint
 Wontonimo: also, it isn't anticipating the next checkpoint after having gone around the track once
 GamingGnawer: does anything wierd happen if you have many nested function calls in c++?
 GamingGnawer: like recursive calls
 Flaise: You can end up with a stack overflow
 StickMan5121: hehehehe
 ButtholeBoy: Butt
 StickMan5121: :joy:
 StickMan5121: wtf
 nikelhaus: report this guy lol
 Wontonimo: kicked
 nikelhaus: he's still in my clash atm
 Wontonimo: kicked from world chat
 Wontonimo: he hasn't been banned from the server.  if it continues he may be
 GamingGnawer: I get no error, but the code manages to produce different results when called with same parameters
 AlkhilJohn.: Yeah the bloody guy
 AlkhilJohn.: I don't wat porn on this site
 Wontonimo: for what multi GamingGnawer
 pneuma303: Agreed
 pneuma303: Please ban ButtholeBoy
 GamingGnawer: I'm doing the Treasure hunt easy puzzle
 AlkhilJohn.: I want his account delete/his pfp reset
 CptReynolds: how long does it take to update rank&#160;?
 GamingGnawer: solves 5/6 tests but behaves very strangely on the largest grid
 CptReynolds: or how often does it happen
 Wontonimo: AlkhilJohn., you've been unpleasant to others here.  cool it
 AlkhilJohn.: How have I been unpleasant
 AlkhilJohn.: The stuff I have done is nothing serious
 AlkhilJohn.: Automaton2000 Telk this mod I am innocent
 Automaton2000: i've never done anything like that
 AlkhilJohn.: Yeah
 AlkhilJohn.: see?
 Wontonimo: then continue and meet the reality of being banned
 AlkhilJohn.: ok, ok, ok lets just chill it for a little
 Wontonimo: do you have any randomness GamingGnawer&#160;?
 GamingGnawer: no, it's a pathfinding search, should be completely deterministic
 Wontonimo: and which test case is causing issues?
 Wontonimo: 06 "that's a maze"&#160;?
 GamingGnawer: yes
 Wontonimo: and have you printed out step by step what it is doing while trying to solve that one?  like a picture of the path so far
 GamingGnawer: an 28 on subsequent calls
 Wontonimo: have you looked at the test case?
 Wontonimo: here it is

 Wontonimo: it doesn't add up to 589504547
 GamingGnawer: hihi, no it does not :P
 Wontonimo: there is no way to collect that much treasure

 Wontonimo: anymore spam here AlkhilJohn. and its a kick
 GamingGnawer: and I haven't the faintest idea how it managed to find 589504547
 AlkhilJohn.: alright. Also, what really happens when you get kicked? Can't you just rejoin by refreshing?
 Wontonimo: so, the IDE will only give you so much debug output.  But you can copy your code and the expected input to your computer and run it there and see all the debug you want
 BFB123: Hello!
 Wontonimo: change you name or get banned.
 BFB123: WTF?

 BFB123: Lol sorry about that
 BFB123: that was very immature of me
 AlkhilJohn.: Yes, but there are also kids here, fix yourself.
 BFB123: Yes sir.
 BFB123: Wait isn't AjkhilJohn a bot?
 AlkhilJohn.: Let's not get into that
 BFB123: :o
 aimenrma: only some times
 Wontonimo: GamingGnawer is your bot able to do 04 "Easy life"&#160;?
 myNickName01: :joy: dude's crazy AF ... rofl
 GamingGnawer: yes all works fine except the last on 06
 AlkhilJohn.: GamingGnawer is there an output for the 6th test case?
 myNickName01: there are terms and conditions....obey them... 
 myNickName01: or face deletion
 GamingGnawer: it's supposed to be 39, but I get on the first call of my function and 28 on subsequent calls with the same parameteres
 GamingGnawer: *589504547 on the first call
 GamingGnawer: which tells me something has gone very wrong
 Wontonimo: what does your program report this has
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c83a5f6-4011-4084-b221-3afc48be0fe0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c83a5f6-4011-4084-b221-3afc48be0fe0</a>
 Wontonimo: it is 21 x 21
 Wontonimo: you can use the custom thing to run it in the IDE
 GamingGnawer: eeh... that gives segmentation fault
 Wontonimo: oh
 GamingGnawer: oh no
 Wontonimo: i'll make a smaller one
 GamingGnawer: sry
 GamingGnawer: it gives 0
 Wontonimo: it can't find the 5&#160;?
 GamingGnawer: (i just forgot to add the dimensions)
 GamingGnawer: guess not...
 Wontonimo: well, there is a problem then
 Wontonimo: probably that is easier to find the bug for than 06 "That's a maze"
 AlkhilJohn.: Ahh yes, I see the issue
 GamingGnawer: actully.... it gives 1432063536
 GamingGnawer: and then it gives 0
 Wontonimo: instead of 5
 AlkhilJohn.: The path detects the end when it cannot go left or right, but still up.
 GamingGnawer: yes, it's nice to have multiple wrong answers
 Wontonimo: can you print out which cells it has visited&#160;?
 Wontonimo: for the 0 case
 Wontonimo: like, how did it miss the gold
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: has anyone noticed the puzzles here have a huge amount of repetition?  I mean, do we really need 50 BFS puzzles?
 Wontonimo: are called 'practice' for a reason... :thinking:
 GamingGnawer: oooh I found a bug
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I'm just worried people here won't be well-rounded.
 GamingGnawer: 100% win!
 Wontonimo: what was it?
 GamingGnawer: When examaning a node i used auto&amp; x{stack.back()}
 GamingGnawer: and then if a node was exhausted i would pop the stack
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Maybe a puzzle where you are given a big chunk of code and you have to debug it to pass.  That's more like a real-world task
 GamingGnawer: but after this i would pass x.score back the recursive function
 GamingGnawer: and that was ofcourse undefined now, that the stack.back() had been deleted
 GamingGnawer: As is often the case, I now wonder how that ever worked for the first 5 tests :P
 zyi: How to play itÔºü
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I bet if I took my freecell solution and introduced 50 compiler errors, and then another 50 things you have to fix to get 100%, people would have great fun solving
 Jerrasterix: does JS not support recursion&#160;??
 Wontonimo: no, i like solving my bug because i have more skill in solving them.  
 Wontonimo: yes, js supports recursion Jerrasterix
 Jerrasterix: then what is tail call optimisation&#160;??
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-optimizations-tail-call-optimization-tco-471b4f8e4f37">https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-optimizations-tail-call-optimization-tco-471b4f8e4f37</a>
 AntiSquid: Tail call optimization means that, if the last expression in a function is a call to another function, then the engine will optimize so that the call stack does not grow.
 Wontonimo: oh, nice.  i didn't know that
 AntiSquid: me neither, i just found out lol
 Jerrasterix: Ohhh.... Thanks AntiSquid!!&#160;:) 
 AntiSquid: np, gn8, matrix 4 sucks btw, worst movie in a while
 CptReynolds: is it out&#160;? lol
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: probably all about a 14 year old girl who knows everything like all the other new movies
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: looking at you ghostbusters
 ipsissimus: hello friends
 ipsissimus: can this be shortened even more?
 ipsissimus: i think it can be 1 lined but idk how
 Wontonimo: yeah, just get rid of the return
 ipsissimus: i mean with everything inside the print function
 ipsissimus: like:
 ipsissimus: print(x, len(x) for x in range(0,y)
 ipsissimus: or something like that\
 Wontonimo: print("\n".join([w[0:len(w)-i]+'*'*i for i in range(0,len(w:=input())+1)]))
 ipsissimus: hmm i thought i tried something like that but the puzzle complained
 ipsissimus: ill play with that solution on it with the puzzle search tool
 ipsissimus: thanks
 Flaise: Argh. Why can't I fix my bot. Why I gotta be so dumb.
 Wontonimo: which bot?
 Flaise: Clash of Bots
 AlkhilJohn.: How do you do treasure hunt puzle (easy)?
 Flaise: The top 5 are stomping me into the ground
 Jerrasterix: did clash of bots get approved&#160;??
 Andrew_OHara: What's clash of bots?

 Jerrasterix: this is a different one&#160;:(
 Flaise: You're thinking of "Explode Another Day". That one's still WIP.
 Flaise: lol I had the naming conversation with the creator on Discord.

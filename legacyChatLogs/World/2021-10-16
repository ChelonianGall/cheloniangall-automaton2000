 jacek: :3
 eulerscheZahl: also: why do I already want to kick a few users the second I open the chat?&#160;:(
 struct: I also just opened it
 struct: I hope my €/ban goes up
 eulerscheZahl: will we be on strike during the contest? :angel:
 VizGhar: wait... you guys are getting paid? :D
 struct: I wont moderate it, I said it before
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:+1:
 struct: no VizGhar
 eulerscheZahl: we get paid in information. even if very little
 Astrobytes: No I won't moderate during the contest 
 eulerscheZahl: Skynet 1 was renamed to Death First Search. We saw that coming before it happened. and that's about it
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Mühle is approved
 jacek: the what
 Astrobytes: 9MM?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and we lost Zeno. didn't show up for the contest&#160;:(
 VizGhar: most of you probably wont attend the contest right?
 struct: which contest?
 Astrobytes: I won't participate, no.
 eulerscheZahl: won't play, nope
 eulerscheZahl: doing alternatives these days
 eulerscheZahl: like codeforces, reply
 struct: im trying cf but I still struggle a lot
 eulerscheZahl: because you do the short rounds
 struct: but im improving slowly I guess
 eulerscheZahl: marathons are more fun
 VizGhar: I won't play as well. Wasted time&#160;:)
 VizGhar: by marathonst you mean 7+day contests?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to inflate their numbers
 eulerscheZahl: on codeforces it was 5 days for 1 optim

 eulerscheZahl: maybe B)
 VizGhar: :nerd:
 MSmits: :egg: :hatching_chick: :hatched_chick: :baby_chick: :penguin:
 MSmits: which was first, the egg or the penguin?
 eulerscheZahl: the egg
 MSmits: correct
 eulerscheZahl: not necessarily a penguin egg
 eulerscheZahl: i think fishes are older for instance
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: it's a semantic discussion anyway, even if you limit it to penguin eggs
 MSmits: because at some point a species that is not a penguin made an egg that has a penguin in it. So is it a penguin egg or a pre-penguin species egg. For which species is the egg named?
 Astrobytes: tell me again how this relates to Dots &amp; Boxes?
 MSmits: how did you know where I was going&#160;?
 Astrobytes: just a hunch :P
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 geppoz: someone solved the puzzle of the week in O(1)&#160;?
 MSmits: did you solve it in O(n) and it wasn't fast enough?
 eulerscheZahl: there's one puzzle that tells you to solve it in O(n). I could only think of an O(n^2) solution. So I did it in O(n^3) just because...
 Westicles: yeah, it is on oeis
 geppoz: no, I solve in O(n) and it is fast enough
 MSmits: you can look at other people's solutions after you solve it
 geppoz: but when there is a way to solve in O(1) I can't avoid to challenge myself
 MSmits: ahh ok you just want to know if someone managed it, but come up with the answer yourself
 geppoz: yes, just curious if someone did already, not asking for help&#160;;)
 geppoz: (or I'm disqualified by myself :D )
 struct: so many repeated states on c4 o.o
 ja_fica: maybe we should use a TT then
 struct: I used uint128_t as key, its very slow but was just to get perfect hash
 struct: It was like &gt; 1/3 states repeat on the mcts expansion
 ja_fica: one trick is to use 72 bits only and update the 8 upper keys everytime you play
 struct: on the first turn at least
 Astrobytes: 128 seems overkill
 ja_fica: 128 seems the good way but there is a faster one
 struct: yeah i wont use 128 was just to get no repetition at all
 MSmits: there's no such thing as a perfect hash is there?
 struct: i mean wrong collisions
 struct: ofc there is MSmits
 ja_fica: overwrite TT are so much faster
 ja_fica: you can use ARS to generate almost perfects hashs
 MSmits: what do you mean struct?
 struct: By perfect i mean no collision :p
 MSmits: even if you use 128 bit, it's gonna have buckets and some states will share a bucket
 ja_fica: yes
 ja_fica: perfect is not possible
 ja_fica: on C4 at least
 MSmits: ahh ok, no collision
 MSmits: not really worth it in my experience
 ja_fica: collision means same bucket
 MSmits: allow for some small&#160;%. it's ok
 ja_fica: on MCTS it may be worth it on expansion only
 MSmits: well... i think he means collision with  overwrite
 MSmits: yes of course expansion only, not sure how you would use it in the sim
 ja_fica: to help first part of UCT
 ja_fica: since you have a better score evaluation on TT
 ja_fica: you can use it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cab905bb-a3ae-4ba1-9506-620ffd0ce492">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cab905bb-a3ae-4ba1-9506-620ffd0ce492</a>
 ja_fica: repeated state on C4 and TT are only worth it after 4 plays
 ja_fica: *you-enemy-you-enemy
 FakeName1: how do I close chat
 struct: why only after 4 plays?
 VizGhar: just hide it FakeName1 (see first button on bottom)
 MSmits: 4 plays seems oddly specific
 ja_fica: because you wont have repaeted states before that
 MSmits: any reasonable bot should probably have first 4 plays hardcoded anyway&#160;:)
 struct: ah I see
 ja_fica: even if you evaluate a more advanced state
 MSmits: but first 4 plays have a negligible total amount of expansions
 ja_fica: only after 4 it can be repeated
 ja_fica: yes thats true&#160;:)
 MSmits: in my experience TT is worth it mostly near the end with a smaller branching
 MSmits: but C4 doesnt have much branching to begin with so it might be good
 VizGhar: somebody has rules for all leagues on CSB? I don't want to code something I'll throw away
 ja_fica: MCTS is not the most famous algorithm for TT, but it is worth it along with alpha-zero
 Yaa-Seen: WTF&#160;?
 struct: VizGhar only gold rules matter
 VizGhar: I want to know at least how speed works
 struct: physics wont change
 struct: only that on first league there are no collisions
 MSmits: if you're a good player and know you're going to pass the first leagues easily and dont want to waste time, do a -3 vel and then switch to a search in gold
 ja_fica: I trained a NN, using a variation of meta MCTS but the end result finished in alpha-zero around 50% winrate against fully MCTS solver. which is sad... 
 struct: 50% is not bad
 VizGhar: ok, but on bronze I cant see physics described at all... do I have to figure it out?
 MSmits: ah yeah there's unofficial referees
 struct: was it against a bot with book?
 ja_fica: yes, for first time alpha-zero it is not bad
 ja_fica: nah it wasn't
 ja_fica: probably the bot with bot would win
 ja_fica: *book
 MSmits: mcts solver is really strong in c4
 MSmits: so it's definitely not bad
 VizGhar: aha... sure, referees&#160;:| havent been here long time... I'll look for brutaltester
 struct: was it self trained?
 ja_fica: I did'nt self trained as usual alpha-zero
 ja_fica: I trained the same way i trained my opening book
 ja_fica: trained the NN in keras. passed the withgs with auto-vectorization

 ja_fica: I use only one
 MSmits: ahh ok, i use 8 these days. I can do 10, but my cpu gets hot
 VizGhar: thank you all
 ja_fica: your meta MCTS is much better then mine, I can assure you that
 struct: just wait for winter
 MSmits: well I spent a crazy amount of time working on it 
 MSmits: have around 10 different ones for many games
 ja_fica: I use queues with 3 commands you update and backpropagate but not all state fit into memory
 MSmits: use persistent memory
 ja_fica: SSD?
 MSmits: yes
 ja_fica: with indexation?
 MSmits: let me share what i use, sec
 ja_fica: or swap memory
 MSmits: static readonly PersistentDictionary&lt;Guid, Guid&gt; nodes = new PersistentDictionary&lt;Guid, Guid&gt;("Connect4 Database");
 MSmits: a Guid is a 128 bit type
 ja_fica: C#
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: the bot itself runs in c++
 MSmits: but this program starts the bots 
 MSmits: this way I can use windows forms to make an easy gui
 ja_fica: My idea it to use MCTS for a NN and opening book for the first 10 plays
 MSmits: yeah thats my idea for oware
 ja_fica: so I don't have to train the NN for too far way states
 MSmits: it's a nice idea
 jacek: mhm
 ja_fica: I really love NN in c++, such clean code
 MSmits: wait a min, are you training the NN for the opening or after the opening?
 jacek: yes
 ja_fica: after the opening, using the data from the meta MCTS
 ja_fica: opening book needs to be small
 ja_fica: other I can't assure the 100k code size
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: if you code it right you can fit around 200k moves in the codesize for C4
 ja_fica: early game, exact play, mid game NN approximation play, end game, full MCTS
 MSmits: most I have ever used is around 4k. So opening book will not limit your size really
 struct: I dont think end game mcts is needed
 struct: game will be decided by then
 ja_fica: MCTS solver is good for end game
 MSmits: you can just solve it
 jacek: NN is quite crappy for exact endgames
 ja_fica: exacly
 MSmits: yeah re curse has struggled a lot with this
 ja_fica: I lose many games in my NN implementation because of the endgame
 ja_fica: so I will have 11 exits in my NN
 MSmits: it's no shame to have a separate bot for endgames
 MSmits: use the right tool for the job
 ja_fica: 1 for value, 9 for transition prob and another for miss rate
 ja_fica: miss rate will tell me the state that are not fit to continue to use the NN 
 ja_fica: good for both bad plays and endgames
 ja_fica: I tried testing alpha-zero mcts first time 2 days ago, I'm having trouble sleeping trying to make this work 
 MSmits: well at least that means you're motivated
 ja_fica: a lot
 ja_fica: you probably were too the first time you tried meta MCTS
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw, look up memory mapped 
 MSmits: for c++
 MSmits: I've never done that but thats what re curse told me
 MSmits: to use persistent memory
 ja_fica: I can do disk indexation by hand, I have done it once
 MSmits: ahh ok, yeah i guess i have too, for my oware endgame book. 60+ GB. That's all c++ too
 ja_fica: but I will look into look up memory mapped
 MSmits: the difference is the endgame book is sequential, an array-like structure
 ja_fica: you can index it both to find the correct file or to jumo to the correct byte 
 MSmits: doing this with a hashed structure is much harder
 ja_fica: *jump
 MSmits: yeah
 ja_fica: jacek
 ja_fica: what you NN config in C4
 ja_fica:&#160;?
 jacek: one hots as input, 128 hidden layer and 32 second hidden layer and output is value
 ja_fica: 1 output only?
 ja_fica: you so use regular UCT
 Shrimpster: Yo lads, a quick question. How do you use timing in cpp contest and is this wrong: (while((double (clock() - begin) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC) &lt; timestamp))&#160;? where begin is a clock() 
 ja_fica: chrono::high_resolution_clock::now()
 Shrimpster: :o 
 ja_fica: chrono::duration_cast&lt;chrono::microseconds&gt;(Now() - start).count();
 ja_fica: to count microseconds
 Shrimpster: its more precise right? 
 ja_fica: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://paste.ofcode.org/k9JjK49FcbW7zjNNcwB4cZ">https://paste.ofcode.org/k9JjK49FcbW7zjNNcwB4cZ</a>
 jacek: ja_fica yes, mcts + value only, no policy
 Shrimpster: thanks &lt;3 
 ja_fica: backpropagate the value on each expansion? 
 ja_fica: or keep running on endgame?
 jacek: no playout, just use the value from NN

 ShadF0x: Hi, I'm trying to solve the second testcase for "There is no spoon", the horizontal one, and the WebIDE keeps telling me "your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction" and failing the execution
 ShadF0x: What exactly does this error even mean?
 jacek: are you receiving all inputs before printing any output?
 ShadF0x: Well, there are two ints and one string line
 ShadF0x: Pretty sure I receive everything
 Astrobytes: outputting twice will do this also
 ShadF0x: I remember there was an option to open any testcase and see what exactly it pushes into the program, but I can't seem to find the button now
 jacek: thats solo game
 jacek: can you share the code
 ShadF0x: Sure, how?
 jacek: paste here
 Astrobytes: just paste it here, it auto-pastebins

 ShadF0x: Huh, neat
 Husoski: fwiw, I see that error message often when a run ends on an error message, only to have it go way when the error was fixed.  No change to input handling.
 jzen: if (in.hasNextLine()) {
 jzen: This the problem no?
 ShadF0x: Doesn't seem to be, the previous testcase worked just fine
 jacek: at the bottom you have (-1, -1) is not to the right of (0, 0). Expected (2, 0).
 jzen: But doesn't in.nextLine read in a line?
 Astrobytes: (-1, -1) is not to the right of (0, 0). Expected (2, 0).
 jacek: i think the puzzle expects right answer line before proceeding to the next line
 jacek: slowbytes
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, slowbytes strikes again
 jacek: so you shouldnt worry about the warning, but the valid answer
 Astrobytes: ^
 Husoski: Like I said...
 ShadF0x: My bad then, sorry
 jacek: :fist:
 TimothyAlexisVass: I had a really good solution and then met some edge cases, so I fiddled on what I had instead of starting over with something proper and got this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4e47f774-f394-4d80-880b-7bf0afc6211f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4e47f774-f394-4d80-880b-7bf0afc6211f</a>

 Moodyz: any front devs here working full time&#160;?
 Astrobytes: jacek: a slight improvement there :D
 jacek: lucky resubmit
 Astrobytes: pretty sure you changed something
 jacek: yeah, it shows "book" for first 12 plies
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: :imp:
 jacek: when i understood that loa mcts solver pseudocode, i transcended to highest level
 MSmits: loa should be coded in lua
 jacek: and chess in go
 MSmits: and snake in python
 struct: you added opening book jacek?
 MSmits: it just says Book
 struct: ah
 MSmits: because troll
 struct: is it NN yet?
 jacek:         if (game.rounds &lt; 12) cout &lt;&lt; format_move(move-&gt;move) &lt;&lt; " book" &lt;&lt; endl;
 jacek: yes
 jacek: i thought it wouldnt learn much from raw inputs, yet it did
 EricSMSO: Gosh I really need to go into NN. No country for old men :older_man:
 Shrimpster: Ultimate tic tac toe: Ive implemented mcts treesolver, mate in one to my mcts, any other suggestions? Im top 69 in gold and wanna beat the MightyCarlo BotIm getting about 15-6k rollouts 1st move and 2nd 1.5-2k idk what else to optimize
 jacek: optimized exploration constant?
 jacek: used teccles 'opening'?
 Shrimpster: yeah I use Teccles on first turn
 jacek: are you using bitboards
 Shrimpster: for ucb I use avg+sqrt(4/n). Found it on a paper for MCTSsolver Don't really know how to optimize
 Shrimpster: Yep, a matrix of 9 integers -&gt; 18bits each (one for each grid)
 jacek: hmm ucb normally is avg + C * sqrt(log(n)/N), and the C is tunable
 Shrimpster: I love how youre casually just the 6th in the world xD 
 Shrimpster: With n being parent and N child's time visited right? 
 jacek: oops yes
 Shrimpster: Doesnt change too much but yeah... Anything else to recommend? 
 jacek: im assuming you already using the optimization #pragma
 Shrimpster: Uhhhh...? 
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops", "omit-frame-pointer", "inline")
 jacek: put these as first line in your code, before the includes
 jacek: lines
 Shrimpster: What do they do?
 jacek: normally c++ code is compiled in debug mode, which is slower
 Shrimpster: ahhh 
 Shrimpster: May I ask what C value you recommend for UCB&#160;?
 jacek: should give you considerable speedup
 Shrimpster: Ive seen that sqrt 2 is the theoretical, but idk how to optimize 
 jacek: when i used 'normal' mcts, i used C = 0.5. note i have loss = -1, draw = 0, win = 1
 Shrimpster: Let me guess... Youve modified it to the point its not recognisable as mcts anymore? ^.^
 jacek: i simply run the changed version locally against my baseline for 1000 games and see where it is highest winrate
 Shrimpster: ahhh okay 
 Shrimpster: didnt think about less than 1 
 jacek: its mcts-wannabe + NN
 Shrimpster: I usually just submit and see what does best 
 jacek: have you tried the pragmas yet? how much rollouts do they give
 struct: Shrimpster the pragmas should help
 struct: also do you allocate all the nodes on first turn?
 Shrimpster: yeah let me switch the ucbs real quick and ill see
 Shrimpster: LOL!!!! 
 Shrimpster: 92k 
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: Shrimpster what about the memory?
 struct: do you allocate memory during node expansion?
 jacek: now it should be enough to get into might carlo
 Shrimpster: Im comming for top 6 now jacek :joy: :joy: :joy:
 jacek: :scream:
 struct: 92k on first turn right?
 Shrimpster: yeah
 Shrimpster: i dont allocate memory
 struct: how do you store nodes then?
 Shrimpster: but its not too memory efficient since I pass the whole grid each turn 
 Shrimpster: On normal .1 sec I get 9k rollouts 
 jacek: grid?
 Shrimpster: yeah the 9 integers I was saying earlier
 struct: im confused about your mcts tree though
 Shrimpster: hmm? 
 Shrimpster: why? 
 struct: your tree has nodes right?
 Shrimpster: yup, with stuff in them 
 Shrimpster: I dont allocate how much memory I use 
 jacek: you have gamestate in your node?
 struct: so you create new nodes every time you expand?
 Shrimpster: yeah
 Shrimpster: to both
 Shrimpster: Do you recommend to play it out each time? that sounds slow&#160;:/ 
 struct: you should create a memory pool on first turn
 struct: for the nodes
 struct: like Node nodes[10'000'000];
 Shrimpster: :o
 struct: allocating memory is expensive
 Shrimpster: and use em as Node[address] instead of pointers?
 struct: this is how my node looks like
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc60e3fc-445d-402a-9409-7cd8ad4c2ed5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc60e3fc-445d-402a-9409-7cd8ad4c2ed5</a>
 struct: then on expansion I just do
 struct: nodes[used_nodes++] = Node(...);
 struct: nodes is the array I allocated on first turn
 Shrimpster: Yeah makes sense 
 struct: Im not sure if storing the state in the node is worth
 jacek: only if makeMove would be expensive
 struct: my State is 48 bytes
 jacek: but i only store move in the node
 struct: I usually also only store the move
 struct: bt,loa,c4,uttt all games where its fast to apply a move
 Shrimpster: yeah... I'll implement the allocation thing first and see later if the make move is slower than keeping the state&#160;:/ 
 struct: whats the size of your state?
 struct: cerr &lt;&lt; sizeof(State) &lt;&lt; endl;
 Shrimpster: 96
 Shrimpster: idk what that means, but sounds like a lot
 struct: 96 bytes
 Shrimpster: oh, thats double yours
 jacek: still, with this rollouts number you should be in legend even without much heuristics
 Shrimpster: Also it seems with pragma I made it to top 50 only&#160;:/ 
 struct: I think he needs a few more jacek
 Shrimpster: haha u just said it 
 struct: he needs 20k on 2nd turn
 struct: he currently should have around 10k
 Shrimpster: Yeah youve said that again
 jacek: but hmm.. is v:2 and v:-2 solved position?
 Shrimpster: yup I get about 9k 
 Shrimpster: yep
 jacek: they should be solved sooner. is mcts solver implementation ok?
 Shrimpster: Oh lol you're watching me?
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Shrimpster: I think it should be&#160;:/ 
 Shrimpster: I mean... its relatively simple minimax right?
 Shrimpster: Mind you I only have 9k rollouts each turn 
 jacek: somehat, yes. but it should solve the win several plies sooner than 2-3
 MeBen: Why are there people who think y is a vowel?
 struct: do you reuse the mcts tree Shrimpster?
 jacek: in my country y counts as vowel
 Shrimpster: yeah you're right, it is kinda odd 
 Shrimpster: In mine too&#160;:)
 MeBen: What languages are those?
 Shrimpster: Yeah of course struct ^^  I dont use inputs 
 jacek: :flag_pl:
 Astrobytes: MeBen: Polish and Greek
 struct: Then you probably should be solving sooner
 Shrimpster: Yeah Im seeing it now... youre right
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/586185958">https://www.codingame.com/replay/586185958</a>
 struct: here you are solving 2 plies
 jacek: so many wroclaw guys submitting to uttt right now oO
 Astrobytes: is there something special about that Uni jacek?
 jacek: dunno. i think their teacher assign exercises on CG
 struct: lol
 Shrimpster: wroclaw? wheres that?
 struct: poland
 Shrimpster: Lul saw the gold number go up about 20 ppl since last week I started, thats probably them :D 
 jacek: here you can see i solved it several plies before the end <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/586186311">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/586186311</a> despite the lower 'rollouts' number
 TheBlueBias: Oya there. We're back.
 Shrimpster: Yeah youre correct&#160;:/ I'll find the error 
 Astrobytes: Back from where Blaise?
 Shrimpster: Thanks a lot kind people for the tips and youre time!&#160;:) 
 jacek: to uttt discussions
 Astrobytes: lol
 TheBlueBias: reply challenge
 Astrobytes: Ahaaa
 Astrobytes: How did it go?
 jacek: huh?
 Astrobytes: jacek: A CTF
 TheBlueBias: Pretty hard, and big gap with the top. But was fun, and we're 20th.
 struct: I think it still solves correctly but seems a bit late
 Astrobytes: nice, well done to you all&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: you share music videos
 eulerscheZahl: and then youtube is suggesting weird stuff for a few days
 TheBlueBias: :rofl:
 TheBlueBias: Well. That's not a music video.
 Astrobytes: lol, on stream for a second lol
 eulerscheZahl: it's something
 Astrobytes: hahahaha ffs Blaise :rofl:
 Astrobytes: true euler&#160;:)
 jacek: no one wants to be jacek&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: wonder why :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: do you want to be a jacek?
 Westicles: huh?
 struct: I want to be a jacek
 Westicles: oO
 niluthebear: I want to be a derjack
 jacek: :upside_down:

 MACKEYTH: In Spring Challenge 2020 do lines of visibility go through edge warps?
 Westicles: there are a couple camelcase ones already
 VizGhar: well... for contributors it is hardly possible to know that there are already such CoCs&#160;:)
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=camelcase&amp;category=ANY&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=camelcase&amp;category=ANY&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on</a>
 niluthebear: i love to see some algorithmic problems 
 niluthebear: i don't like strings
 Westicles: I'm not sure how to make a good reverse.  Should almost everyone instantly see the trick, or should half the people never see it?
 struct: test cases should make it obvious imo
 VizGhar: agreed, but not first 1-2 testcases... hide some trick in 4th/5th
 Shrimpster: Classic puzzle creator mindset by VizGhar :D 
 Westicles: It is tricky.  I thought this one is straightforward, but maybe not
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7437a2695e9623773636585c212713d5ad0e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7437a2695e9623773636585c212713d5ad0e</a>
 VizGhar: nice
 jacek: i liked the one when it had something like 1+4=?, and 3*?=100, and the answer was the length of the equation
 struct: lol
 niluthebear: lol
 VizGhar: Hmm what is that last achievement in Puzzles section?
 struct: solve nintendo
 VizGhar: I mean "Participate 3 times in the ranking of puzzle solutions"
 Shrimpster: Being an active member in the community&#160;:)
 VizGhar: After I solve puzzle, i can give upvote to puzzle. But it's not it right?
 Shrimpster: If you enjoyed it, I guess, why not
 Uljahn: when you go to community solutions you should be prompted two solutions to choose from
 Shrimpster: and leave a comment 
 Westicles: people don't seem to often upvote accepted contribs, but it is nice to do if you like it
 TimothyAlexisVass: Perl$s = '1211';

 Uljahn: no spam
 Uljahn: sry
 Uljahn: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: should i change my code to do that
 VizGhar: Community solutions? I gave multiple thumbs up on puzzle solutions after solving them. But this is for pending contributions only?
 struct: which achievement is it?
 VizGhar: Budding examinerParticipate 3 times in the ranking of puzzle solutions.
 struct: ah maybe rate solutions of other users?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Why does this happen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1016ef46-94c9-4151-8896-7d61d54a9ecf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1016ef46-94c9-4151-8896-7d61d54a9ecf</a>
 VizGhar: I though only puzzle solution that can be ranked is the solution you can see after you solve the puzzle&#160;:)
 VizGhar: nope. doesn't work
 struct: maybe other users need to rate yours?
 struct: idk
 struct: but doesnt make sense
 Westicles: oh, for the achievement you have to do the ranking thing.  look on the tab that says 100% when you solve
 bminnix: Have any of you folks ever had your Stream output match exactly what the expectation was but the debugger found "nothing"?
 bminnix: I'm new to this, so it's likely my fault, but was just curious if that ever happens.
 jacek: additional new line?
 bminnix: Accoding to my Stream output the first line was a&gt; "value"

 VizGhar: Thanks Westicles... such hidden achievement o.O
 VizGhar: Why do they want me to rank others? It makes more sense to me, to give achievement for publishing solution.
 TheBlueBias: Nobody said it was supposed to had any sense... :smirk:
 VizGhar: meh... I don't have to like everything :D keep it up guys
 VizGhar: good night

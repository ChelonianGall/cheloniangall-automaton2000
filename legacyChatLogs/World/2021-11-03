 Thorcode: hi
 Steven_YIP:&#160;:
 ESMAKING: hi my name is ESMAKING
 AmmarSalmi: Im struggling with number of descendants thing. Is there a hint?
 Thorcode: which puzzle?
 DustinWestGlow: AmmarSalmi hello&#160;:) which puzzle?
 AmmarSalmi: The latest contest
 AmmarSalmi: The graves and the family tree things
 DustinWestGlow: Thorcode
 AmmarSalmi: Fall challenge 2021
 AmmarSalmi: The crossbow owner has a hint of having 48 descendant
 Thorcode: DustinWestGlow why you ping me?
 AmmarSalmi: So he's males and he has 48 descens
 DustinWestGlow: If you could help him with Fall challenge 2021
 AmmarSalmi: But my algo to calc the descendants of each person on nodes 
 Thorcode: I haven't try that
 AmmarSalmi: seems way slower than it should be 
 KiwiTae: just dfs the descendant its like 2 3 lines 
 KiwiTae: the tree is small too shouldnt take long
 AmmarSalmi: Ok. I'm just useless when it comes to algos. I haven't studied much algos in my life. So I'm using recursion and it's taking forever. I'll try to share my code. If you can point out where I went wrong. Because I'm not even able to debug it because it's too slow.
 AmmarSalmi: not printing anything
 AmmarSalmi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/giRnPQ0P">https://pastebin.com/giRnPQ0P</a>
 DustinWestGlow: Ammar, that is very clean code, it's probably edited for proper counting ( which can be difficult ). Good job so far.
 DustinWestGlow: I'm not familiar with the challenge though. Thor or Kiwi?
 Thorcode: I haven't try that
 Thorcode: sorry
 DustinWestGlow: Ammar, let me look
 Uljahn: guess you can substitute getById(id) with a dictionary id:node
 Uljahn: if ids are unique ofc
 DustinWestGlow: Ammar, id is a built in python function, can you use another word? Or not?
 AmmarSalmi: Oh right. But up untill I got to the descendants thing it caused no problems
 DustinWestGlow: Okay then, so I'm not far enough to see the whole problem. Maybe you can explain what your code is solving.But, why do you have 'descendants' and 'childIds'? Are not those the same things? A descendant is a child, right?
 AmmarSalmi: no a child is your own child, descendant can be the grandson of your grandson.
 AmmarSalmi: Anyone with a family tree that ends up to you is one of your descendants
 AmmarSalmi: So each node has id and childIds. So you take each id in childIds list and dig up their own childIds. And keep going deeper.
 AmmarSalmi: Think of it like website crawling. A link to a page with links. etc...
 DustinWestGlow: Okay, it's crawling. And the challenge fills most of the info like node structure as you solve it. And it has a 90minute time limit?
 AmmarSalmi: No time limit really. It's been days and I'm still solving it.
 DustinWestGlow: on CodingEscape? Mine has a time limit and I had to pass a practice room
 DustinWestGlow: We're talking about the team escape room stuff? I signed up but it's a lot of problems before we get as far as you, right?
 AmmarSalmi: Yes.
 AmmarSalmi: Fall challenge
 AmmarSalmi: 2021
 DustinWestGlow: ok
 AmmarSalmi: The most recent one
 DustinWestGlow: Hey man, I have to log off. I believe you can do it. Remember counting indexes, formatting output, and fixing output is always a time consumer. I will be gone before I can solve or help out.
 derjack: oO
 AmmarSalmi: Thanks for everything
 DustinWestGlow: Yw
 AmmarSalmi: I need to study algorithme. It will make me a better coder. 
 DustinWestGlow: Have you picked up the Algorithms book?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844">https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844</a>
 AmmarSalmi: Nice. I will give it a look. Right now I'm reading learning python by Mark Lutz from O'reilly
 AmmarSalmi: I want to solidify my understanding of the basics
 AmmarSalmi: Thanks for the recommendation
 DustinWestGlow: ofc what are you building? If I may ask? or is it secret
 derjack: algorithms eh\
 DustinWestGlow: yes, why? der, don't you know the algorithms book is very popular, eh
 Uljahn: maybe you should start with data structures first
 DustinWestGlow: upvote
 Uljahn: and big-O notation for complexity
 derjack: i dont want math. i want to make computers think
 Uljahn: but even computers might be inefficient and slow in data handling when being programmed the wrong way
 DustinWestGlow: but if he wants it that way bad enough, he'll make it look like a good alternative
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: are you faster than a human?
 Automaton2000: i think we have the same issue
 DustinWestGlow: what happens when I get stuck drawing out a program but the next step to take in coding it gets farther and farther away
 DustinWestGlow: on aneo
 Ilyas82794: hey guys
 Ilyas82794: remember me
 ropi336: yeah 
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: how to be more popular on CG?
 Automaton2000: do you use your own ide
 Jerrasterix: Automaton2000, I have a question, did you really call eulerschezahl as noob&#160;?
 Automaton2000: and what if i want to reach legend league
 Jerrasterix: Automaton2000, I have a question, did you really call eulerschezahl as noob&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i can't find it in the cloud
 Jerrasterix: It seems the chat is bugged :confused:
 nyloc: Is the red "1" on the ACTIVITIES menu entry always there, it always triggers my OCD to mark something as read...
 GamingGnawer: Is it possible to join only certain kinds of clashes?e.g. only do fastest mode or not do reverse etc.
 ESMAKING:&#160;:)
 GamingGnawer: ok,thanks! I guess I'll need to learn  a more compact language then,c++ is not great for shortest code (at least not when I'm writing it :P )
 Bartos: Hello guys, i need help i don't undersatnd how to counter this problem&#160;: "Timeout: your program did not provide an input in due time."  on the episode Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1
 GamingGnawer: the games define a response time before which your program needs to give an output
 GamingGnawer: chances are your program gets stuck in some infinite loop (or truly massive computation) and doesn't give an output in time
 GamingGnawer: or simply that you've failed to make an output statement
 Bartos: on the standard output i have my "answer" that why i don't undersatnd
 GamingGnawer: do you get the same "Timeout" if you move that output to the top of your program?
 Bartos: yes 
 Bartos: Sortie d'erreur&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4d502e2e-de8b-4108-b4c5-6423072a06ba">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4d502e2e-de8b-4108-b4c5-6423072a06ba</a>
 GamingGnawer: oh... 
 Bartos: it's in french that show you my fprintf stderr output then my standard output and then the informations
 GamingGnawer: hmm, so it looks like your program outputs once
 GamingGnawer: but pherhaps then get's stuck,
 GamingGnawer: you need to output at the end of the "while (1)" block 
 Bartos: it's what i did normally 
 Bartos: i will try soemthing 
 Bartos: maybe i have don't understand very well
 GamingGnawer: i assume you get the error meeage on turn 2/2
 Bartos: yes totally, i give the next position of batman do i have to put his deplacement like a direction and not a next position&#160;??
 Bartos: can i send you my code&#160;??
 GamingGnawer: yeah sure
 PRDaylyanov: I love coc
 Bartos: i modify him a bit and i send you take 2 3 mlin
 Bartos: ok i don't understand i have new output ...

 Bartos: thx for your help i appreciate
 Bartos: i don't understand why now i have 42 43 and not 3 4 cuz at the frist bomb_dir is DR
 MoistySox: fr fr
 GamingGnawer: are you missing a newline?
 GamingGnawer: so you give output but the game doesn't catch it?
 Jerrasterix: Bartos can you share a replay
 Bartos: Oh it seems to be that the new line ...
 Bartos: thx
 GamingGnawer: great!but a nasty little bug
 Bartos: yeah&#160;:'( have nice day&#160;! :D
 andresporras: I want to report a bug, I got 100% percent of the tests correct but after submit I got 0%
 GamingGnawer: u2! 
 Bartos: after submit the test are not the same
 andresporras: but from 100% to 0%?? really?? I might understand 75, 50... but 0?
 Jerrasterix: which puzzle&#160;??
 andresporras: nevermind, I have look other other answers and I get why it happened
 derjack: oO
 Jerrasterix: can someone help me, How to get into top 1000 in Clash of code&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: i am just stuck in 1200s
 derjack: clash more. spam clash links here. there are so many ways to do that ~
 jgizquierdo: this may be a really silly question, but I'm not understanding the formatting of the questions when the inputs are used. There is a for loop on each problem that stores n values. Am I supposed to write my code in that for loop or just store those values in a list? 
 Uljahn: you can modify the default code as you see appropriate, just keep the inputs order intact
 jgizquierdo: ah okay! I didn't know if I was supposed to modify it or not
 nrauto: Hi 
 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 Notgoodatcoding5: @nrauto How are you?
 Chazzy: Where can i go to learn JavaScript here?
 VizGhar: You want learn basics here
 VizGhar: *won't
 zeedev: hi from where r u guys
 linjoehan: what time dose this event thing end?
 Kepe55: Do you guys use scratch paper when solving problems?
 Syzer3: @Kepe55 when the problem is hard
 Syzer3: how about you&#160;?
 Kepe55: I use a whiteboard
 Syzer3: I tihnk I'm gonna beat the Boss 3
 Kepe55: I tried to only use comments but that's a bad idea, I cant draw diagrams and stuff
 Syzer3: I think I'm gonna organize for myself
 Syzer3: Think MrFriser will also beat the Boss 3
 jacek: boss 3?
 Syzer3: Yeah.. just starting
 Syzer3: got to bronze league
 jacek: nice
 jacek: im assuming its pod racing
 Syzer3: how many boost there are always only one&#160;?
 Syzer3: yeah
 jacek: yes
 Syzer3: now need to kill boss 4
 Syzer3: how about you&#160;?
 jacek: i havent touched this game for long time. im in the end of legend league
 jacek: you get 2 pods in gold
 Westicles: when the strike over?
 jacek: strike?
 Westicles: mods
 Westicles: oh, I guess now
 Westicles: we need euler to get back and update his NS python script
 jacek: whats wrong with it
 Westicles: it broke with the api change
 jacek: nyoro~n
 darkhorse64: It's a mod strike not a dev strike. However, I remember they say they will reconnect when the "contest" is over
 jacek: isnt it essentially over? whats the point of playing it now
 jacek: (or ever)
 darkhorse64: tbh, I played it with my family out of any competing spirit and it was quite fun in this context. But, ofc, I sorely miss a real programming contest
 Stilgart: jacek: what was the point of playing day1 when CG's servers were out of reach
 Stilgart:&#160;?
 jacek: meow

 Essenti: on escaperoom
 Beretta_Vexee: from help import need&#160;!
 DFAF: 我在学pon
 DFAF: 对
 DFAF: pon
 MACKEYTH: Does CodingEscape include a video chat, or do you need to use another app for communication with your team?
 DigitalOsmosis: how can you get debug output?
 jacek: print to stderr
 MACKEYTH: And some puzzles with graphics have debug playback mode
 Wontonimo: who is St. Derr and why is he the saint of error logging&#160;?
 Wontonimo: Why was the analog oscilloscope not allowed in the fundamentalist Christian church?  Because it was non-binary
 jacek: :door:
 Wontonimo: The oldest computer can be traced back to Adam and Eve. It was an apple but with extremely limited memory. Just 1 byte. And then everything crashed.
 Wontonimo: What did Stephen Hawking say when his computer crashed?
 Wontonimo: Nothing :drum:
 Wontonimo: okay, i think we need a bot that says random computer jokes when there is a lull in conversation for too long
 jacek: what about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: nothing to do with the fact that it is really easy
 Wontonimo: interesting.  almost makes sense given the subject

 ipsissimus: just finished an interview with Ford. :O
 ipsissimus: had 3 people in the interview. dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing 
 ipsissimus: :thinking:
 waschak: what are u talking about
 ipsissimus: i had an interview with Ford.  im not sure i can say it any simpler lol
 ipsissimus: using CoC to practice the skillz
 waschak: should be easy for u to get the job then
 waschak: since u practise on COC
 waschak: i see
 waschak: i know a friend who got the job even if he wasn't that good.
 ipsissimus: thats good news for me lol, i want the job
 waschak: Ford isn't that selective , you just have to know the basics 
 waschak: if you are sure that you did well , then congrats for u , that's what they want
 ipsissimus: but in the CV space for assisted driving
 ipsissimus: i have exp in CV so i really hope it went well
 ipsissimus: :O
 waschak: they will care for sure , even if you lie , my friend lied about the experience , he didn't even have 8 months of experience , but he applied for senior software engineer and he got the job lol
 waschak: in his cv , he said that he has 5 years of experience ...
 ipsissimus: well i didnt lie, but they had a software dev, a software lead, and a manager in the interview
 ipsissimus: sweating bullets for these ambiguous questions they asking
 waschak: like?
 ipsissimus: What tools do you use in the software development landscape? and in what capacity
 ipsissimus: like.. am i supposed to say git and jenkins?
 ipsissimus: are they asking something else? idk
 waschak: they want to see you how familiar are you with software tools
 waschak: that's common thing
 ipsissimus: yeah im just saying, the ambiguity of the questions means i have no idea if my answers were what they were looking for
 ipsissimus: i couldve said we used proprietary tools at my last job and thats true, but would say nothing of my competence
 waschak: they want to see only if you are familiar with the tools that are required for the position
 waschak: so for example if they want you to work with intellij in job description , you have to mention that
 ipsissimus: yeah its mainly python and automation
 ipsissimus: so thats what i went with
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://devhumor.com/content/uploads/images/October2015/nosql.jpeg">https://devhumor.com/content/uploads/images/October2015/nosql.jpeg</a>
 ipsissimus: ye lmao
 waschak: Exactly , even if you know for example java or C++ , you don't have to mention it because they will not care 
 ipsissimus: they asked and i was like, well i have experience with Google non relational datapools
 waschak: well done
 waschak: never say no , always try to change the subject related to what they are asking
 ipsissimus: yeah i think i did pretty good, i also asked them questions to eat in to the interview time
 ipsissimus: who knows if the next question is one i cant answer
 waschak: if they ask me if i know mysql , i will go like , yeah i know the sql langage and i got the opportunity to work with it but i know mostly ms sql or oracle ..
 waschak: and i will expand my answer
 waschak: then for sure if they ask me about oracle or something , thats perfect for me because i know the answer , if not then its good too
 waschak: the idea is not getting caught lying
 ipsissimus: ye u right
 ipsissimus: can anyone shorten this code?
 ipsissimus: t=int(input().replace(':',<i>))</i>q=int(input().replace(':',<i>))</i>print('EARLY'if t&gt;q else'DELAYED'if t&lt;q else'ON TIME')
 ipsissimus: the guy who got 1st place on my question just did it in one line with some voodoo
 ipsissimus: like i dont even want to post what his solution was, itll probably look like spam lmao
 jacek: is this some fixed format?
 jacek: then no need to convert to int, and you can compare strings directly&#160;:?
 ipsissimus: yeah they are times written with&#160;: separators
 ipsissimus: hh:mm:ss
 jacek: oO
 ipsissimus: hh: m m&#160;: ss
 aandrukhovich: hi)you dont need to replace&#160;: symbol, it doesnt affect final comparation
 aandrukhovich: task is just compare 2 string
 ipsissimus: aadrukhovich what is your solution mang
 aandrukhovich: my raw code was```i=inputa,b=i(),i()i('ON TIME'*(a==b)+'EARLY'*(a&gt;b)+(a&lt;b)*'DELAYED')```
 aandrukhovich: my raw code wasi=inputa,b=i(),i()i('ON TIME'*(a==b)+'EARLY'*(a&gt;b)+(a&lt;b)*'DELAYED')
 ipsissimus: and the code you shared was:<b>exec(bytes('㵩湩異ੴⱡ㵢⡩Ⱙ⡩਩⡩伧⁎䥔䕍⨧愨㴽⥢✫䅅䱒❙⠪㹡⥢⠫㱡⥢✪䕄䅌䕙❄਩', 'u16')[2:])</b>
 aandrukhovich: then i applied some magic, it's now a new magic here)
 ipsissimus: which idk what the hell it is
 ipsissimus: cmon man lmao
 ipsissimus: and you share it to meme on me
 TAlshalby: what is CoC?
 ipsissimus: clash of code
 jacek: well, utf16 character which is 2 bytes count as 1 character
 aandrukhovich: yep
 TAlshalby: how do you practice for a job with CoC?
 jacek: he applied for professional coc solver
 ipsissimus: i spam the puzzles and learn something new all the time
 ipsissimus: i learned how to use map() and how to unpack lists with *
 ipsissimus: all here in the solutions other people share
 ipsissimus: i learned that print() has end and sep arguments that help for formatting
 aandrukhovich: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/</a>this can help you a little bit with some python magic in shortest mode)
 ipsissimus: thanks, its not that i want to make the shortest code, its just that its kinda disturbing that i dont even know what it would do if you told me to figure it out lol
 ipsissimus: dang my guy, that link has some hacks

 Majeck: Thanks!
 Stephen10121: does anyone have problems with the group chat disappearing? 
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Stephen10121: like in the clashes when somebody types something, the chat disappears.
 Thorcode: I duno
 ._.YO._.: HELLO WORLD!!!
 Jerrasterix: sorry, The WORLD blocked programmers for spamming its chat
 Wontonimo: noone may utter the W word here, or say hello to it.  Shame!  Heathens!
 Stephen10121: what about wORLD
 Wontonimo: oh, that's fine SpongeBob
 Thorcode: I think I will improve my clash ranks :D
 Jerrasterix: hello Wontonimo&#160;!! still online 
 Jerrasterix: Blaise said that once you have crossed 500 clashes, you can see answers for clash, how can we see it&#160;??
 Thorcode: wow
 Thorcode: really
 Jerrasterix: well first of all, is it true :confused:
 Jerrasterix: idk Thorcode
 Thorcode: ask mod
 Thorcode: the easiet
 Jerrasterix: no mods online 
 Thorcode:&#160;:((
 Thorcode: ask a guy has legend achivement in clash
 Thorcode: hey AlecMan are you there?
 Jerrasterix: he isn't in world chat 
 AlecMan: uhm
 AlecMan: what's up?
 Jerrasterix: ohhhh.... 
 Thorcode: that real?
 Jerrasterix: Blaise said that once you have crossed 500 clashes, you can see answers for clash, how can we see it&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: this one 
 AlecMan: hmmm
 Thorcode: if yes it is not fairi
 AlecMan: I've never looked into it
 Thorcode: oh it is real?
 AlecMan: I'm not sure&#160;:/
 AlecMan: I've never heard of it
 Thorcode: you can figure out
 Jerrasterix: then Blaise trolled that guy ig
 Thorcode: cuz you got that achivment
 AlecMan: yeah I don't see the option anywhere
 Thorcode: wow in my clash alec solved like hack
 Thorcode: how
 Thorcode: for i in range(l):n=int(input());x=n*5 if n%2==0 else n*3;a.append(x)
 Thorcode: what wrong uiwth my code????????????????????
 Thorcode: I can't sum&#160;:((((
 Thorcode: oh I'm stupid

 dmg0425: hi
 dmg0425: yeah neo i agree
 Neosoulink: I know it's possible to resolve these problems but sometimes u've to try hard before understanding how to
 Neosoulink: And sometimes the solution is so easy to make ðŸ˜…
 jacek: everything is hard until becomes easy
 GROUNDPOUNDER85: im still trying to figure out where to even start
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: At the begining
 jacek: oh my
 leitbiz: @GROUND, a good place to start may be something like CodeCombat if you're incredibly new to development
 leitbiz: I would recommend finding whatever you find interesting and following that trail
 GROUNDPOUNDER85: awesome thank you
 leitbiz: for sure! you got this
 tobk: How long does the contest last? I can't see the usual timer anywhere.
 jacek: what contest
 tobk: The not-really-a-contest-escape-game "event". It says "168h", i.e. 7 days, but then it should already be over now, right?
 jacek: you cant escape it
 D.Adrian: did anyone finished the "Custom Game of Life" algorithm? I find it difficult to figure it out what some info mean
 AstroHydes: Thibaud â€” Today at 3:47 PMAs many players continue to play the Fall Challenge 2021 Coding Escape mission daily, we're extending the duration of the event, initially planned until today, to next Monday 9am UTC 
 AstroHydes: - from discord
 jacek: they wouldnt do that to bot programming contest would they
 AstroHydes: my thoughts exactly
 dmg0425: does anyone know how to complete python 3 pod racing?

 Automaton2000: will have to play on the same turn, only the player who had previously diagnosed this sample will successfully complete ...
 jacek: my oh
 SabrinaTTB: I honestly don't know what I'm doing
 jacek: dont we all
 SabrinaTTB: I used to know some basic code like five years ago and now all this seems super complicated.
 Solego: You're in good company, @SabrinaTTB :grinning:
 Solego: I haven't been in a C++ IDE for a decade.  It's coming back slowly!
 mbaier: about to try a coding escape with work buddies
 mbaier: wish us luck!

 Vanadium24: came*
 Westicles: you mean like overcoming crippllng depression?

 Vanadium24: i failed and i  didnt check anyone else's code to see if i could do it 
 Vanadium24: now i'm not sure :p
 5DN1L: I think you can't access clashes until you're at higher levels
 5DN1L: They might be searchable under contributions
 5DN1L: I'm not sure
 Vanadium24: oh alright, thanks

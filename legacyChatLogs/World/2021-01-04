 eulerscheZahl: hi PatrickMcGinnisIImy bulls and cows is just enumerating all possible numbers. then printing on of the candidates and reducing the list based on the response
 eulerscheZahl: that alone will give you a score around 320. improve the printed number a bit and you get 310. 304 on a lucky submit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mine did ok until length&gt;4, then i ran into issues
 eulerscheZahl: i had to convert from C# to C++
 eulerscheZahl: it's a bruteforce game and you PHP is at clear disadvantage
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well there are 3265920 combinations
 eulerscheZahl: and you have 1s to generate them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So, I'm trying to random generate kinda like a GA but with a simplified fitness function
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's not optimal solution, but I shouldn't max out of guesses and thus get 100%
 eulerscheZahl: if you just care about 100%, there are heuristics too
 eulerscheZahl: set a fixed first digit, rotate the remainder
 eulerscheZahl: 12345 -&gt; 13452 -&gt; 14523 -&gt; 15234
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx for feedback, yea bruteforce didn't work
 eulerscheZahl: count the number of bulls
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm working on improving the history eval right now
 eulerscheZahl: ok, good luck&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, guaranteeing yourself some early game history is pretty valuable
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm
 itachi0718: lets go bitches
 itachi0718: imagine a world without womens
 eulerscheZahl: the only one who has to go is you, you've been warned
 proogrmr: yup
 jacek: woo new puzzle of the week
 Stilgart: is there a simple way to find which puzzle is puzzle of the week&#160;?
 proogrmr: yeah me too searching that
 Stilgart: it used to be on the "practice" page, but it is no more
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just look down your notifications... you may have too many notifications if high level
 Stilgart: PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't find it actually
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/next-growing-number">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/next-growing-number</a>
 Stilgart: too many coc notifications&#160;:/
 Stilgart: thanks
 Stilgart: BlaiseEbuth is telling you that the puzzle of the week can be found by clicking on the "Puzzle of the week" green button within the quest map
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. I'm telling that. Hello world&#160;! o/
 Stilgart: thanks 
 Stilgart: hum... shit is happening
 Stilgart: quelqu'un a résolu un puzzle fantome&#160;:(
 Stilgart: en même temps, aucun nouveau ne l'a tenté ce puzzle... j'en déduis que même si un puzzle est supprimé, on peut toujours le résoudre si on a l'url directe vers l'IDE
 jrke: i just discovered there are 55296 ascii characters lol
 jrke: 55295*
 Stilgart: woops, why I am on #world on this tab :D
 Stilgart: jrke: unfortunately, there are only 128&#160;:(
 TheBarnacle: Pretty sure I'm doing a big dumb, the next-gorwing-number weekly challenge suggests there is a way to increment a number while it is a string, how do I do this in C++?
 TheBarnacle: Google was unhelpful
 SPDene: convert to int, increment, convert back to string?
 Stilgart: TheBarnacle: what you need to do is not incrementing
 TheBarnacle: The problem says that conversion isn't necessary
 TheBarnacle: I'll have a think&#160;:) Thanks
 Stilgart: SPDene: that's what people may want to do... fatal mistake :D
 Stilgart: TheBarnacle: it is even quite a bad idea
 jrke: Stilgart run this python code -for i in range(55296):
 Stilgart: that why someone added the note
 Stilgart: jrke: no need
 SPDene: i missed that it was for that puzzle... yeah , think of it as a string of character which happen to be digits, instead of a number
 Stilgart: ascii is 7-bit
 Stilgart: never trust python
 TheBarnacle: Thanks SPDene that's very helpful :D!
 Stilgart: extended ascii (choose yours among many) is 8-bit
 SPDene: ascii definitely only covers 0-127. chr() just happens to convert thing that aren't ascii as well
 Stilgart: chr(i) in python probably return a unicode character
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: I am thinking about puting sokoban in very hard
 eulerscheZahl: i just saw that on #fr
 eulerscheZahl: i was a little unsure myself. it's surely easier than Space Maze. But a whole category easier?
 eulerscheZahl: my solver is just a BFS, no rocket science
 eulerscheZahl: but community success says that it might be harder for others than I expected
 Stilgart: actually, I messed up a lot at space maze
 eulerscheZahl: so it was a 50-50 thing for me.and the egoistic motivation won: more users will see it in hard. but that should not be a criterion
 Stilgart: but my final code is simpler than mine for sokoban
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 Stilgart: and my sokoban is not running within 1s
 Stilgart: takes 1.5s-2s iirc
 eulerscheZahl: mine is easily below 100ms
 eulerscheZahl: wrote it long ago to solve puzzles on a sokoban website
 eulerscheZahl: i give you my permission change the difficulty and tags for my contributions
 Stilgart: precomputing "stuck" destinations would help my code a lot 
 eulerscheZahl: some simple stuck logic does wonders
 eulerscheZahl: pushed to wall, can't move it back? lost!
 MSmits: morning
 Stilgart: in fact, I find that there are too many medium, and that maybe we should shift some puzzles to hard/very hard
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even doing bitboards or any other speed optim
 Stilgart: MSmits: may yours be good
 MSmits: thanks, i am teaching atm
 MSmits: the students are working on a diagnostic test
 MSmits: so i am bored
 eulerscheZahl: another topic: i'm not really happy about the sorting within a category (newest first)
 Stilgart: remote teaching&#160;?&#160;:(
 MSmits: yep
 eulerscheZahl: i'd prefer some mix of new and community rating to promote the more interesting puzzles
 Stilgart: it's hard to promote this
 Stilgart: people do not have the same motivation
 eulerscheZahl: here in Germany we even extended school holidays by a few days
 Stilgart: but filters might help
 eulerscheZahl: and at least for Bavaria remote teaching is likely too
 Stilgart: MSmits: have faith
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl we started vacation 3 days sooner for most
 MSmits: and now it's 2 weeks remote
 Stilgart: (I say that, but I lost mine a week before holidays)
 Stilgart: hum...
 eulerscheZahl: i just hope that the vaccines will help and we don't get a mutation that can resist
 MSmits: same
 SaadMotamed: is there a way i can check my match history&#160;? i wanna check the questions again
 Stilgart: april, may, november and december remote here&#160;:(
 MSmits: vaccines will be fine if the mutation doesnt ruin things
 eulerscheZahl: match history of what?
 SaadMotamed: of the clash i played
 eulerscheZahl: search here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i have to send a daily mail to my boss (working in office or remote)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm numbering those. 145 remove working days so far
 eulerscheZahl: (just to know who was in the office in case of an outbreak, not to keep track if i'm really working)
 MSmits: it's like a prisoner scratching days on his wall :P
 eulerscheZahl: s/remove/remote
 eulerscheZahl: i have a theater themed counter
 eulerscheZahl: begin of act &lt;number&gt;
 MSmits: maybe management nicknamed you Shakespeare
 MSmits: ohh shakespeare mailed me again
 eulerscheZahl: only goes to my direct supervisor who collects those and compiles a list for his supervisor
 MSmits: big company?
 eulerscheZahl: you forgot where i'm working?
 MSmits: oh, siemens energy, yea big
 eulerscheZahl: 88k employees
 MSmits: how many of those are coders?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: we also have a lot of production workshops
 MSmits: yeah i guess so
 MSmits: those arent working from home
 eulerscheZahl: yeah. and at the same time the total number of people in the company should go down. was a no-brainer to send me home
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: though it's the density of employees that matters most
 MSmits: if they send all coders home and leave all the production people lose together at work, it's cheating
 MSmits: close together
 eulerscheZahl: there are still some in the office. now with more empty desks between
 eulerscheZahl: those closer related to daily business
 MSmits: what i mean is, how did they protect the production people?
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to manufacture something, you have to design it on a computer first
 MSmits: ah maybe i am imagining it wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't been in the office for a long time, i don't even know what's happening there
 MSmits: understandable
 MSmits: I'll be at work next week for a little
 eulerscheZahl: of course wearing masks and distancing whenever possible
 MSmits: students will be making tests
 MSmits: and some teachers need to walk around to stop them from cheating
 eulerscheZahl: lunch to-go in the cantine (spellcheck says that's not a word)
 MSmits: canteen?
 MSmits: lunchroom?
 MSmits: kantine in Dutch
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, lunch purchasing+eating place
 eulerscheZahl: Kantine in German too
 Stilgart: cantine is the french word :D
 MSmits: the munch munch cave
 eulerscheZahl: i see you got the idea :D
 eulerscheZahl: and no more open salads. lots of plastic waste

 z64555: tfw you forget an &amp; in your for each and wonder why the elements in the array are never updated
 wizcoin: euler is crazy?
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 eulerscheZahl: i know a bit of Django but refuse to buy the cat in the box without knowing the scope of the question
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: do you use gajim for this char&#160;?
 Stilgart: chat*
 eulerscheZahl: i've set it up but very rarely use it
 eulerscheZahl: webchat works fine
 Stilgart: I tried, but I did notice that some messages where lost (both send and reveice)
 Stilgart: so I use the webchat
 eulerscheZahl: I just wanted to test an unban. found and /invite but seemed that it didn't work
 eulerscheZahl: but Gajim shown you how users are connected
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. YurkovAS was online via pidgin
 Stilgart: pidgin /o\
 Stilgart: (I blacklisted it a long time ago for storing my password in plain text file in my home)
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong with it?
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 YurkovAS: eulerscheZahl yes
 MSmits: Stilgart not encrypted?
 MSmits: or hashed i should say
 Stilgart: MSmits: not at all
 Stilgart: grep -R is my best friend when trying to find reliable apps
 Stilgart: damned, can we refuse followers&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but that will move my password to .bash_history /o\
 eulerscheZahl: robin hood following? :P
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: not when you xkill your term :D
 Stilgart: (same as you, I guess)
 eulerscheZahl: no idea. i have &gt; 700 followers and the tab just died when i wanted to search for him
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: is automatonNN in there too
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code in a test code that will probably still take more time 
 eulerscheZahl: i could go to his profile and see whom he follows...and i'm in the list
 MSmits: I bet he is
 MSmits: that freak bot
 Stilgart: but just in case, 
 Stilgart: grep -R -e `cat` .
 Stilgart: does the job just fine&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: what does that do? ask to enter password?
 eulerscheZahl: running this in / will take some time
 z64555: -_- why is cout being delayed when cerr works just fine
 MSmits: cout is for output
 z64555: I'm aware
 MSmits: it ends your bots turn
 MSmits: cerr doesnt, unless you timeout
 MSmits: i guess thats why you experience it as causing delay?
 z64555: Point being, it's being recognized by the game when the loop is already in the next cycle
 MSmits: you might not be  reading the input properly
 MSmits: turns might not be synchronized between referee and bot
 MSmits: because of this
 MSmits: to be sure, save your bot in a file, reset the code in the ide, and compare the input reading in the stub
 MSmits: or whatver the standard code is called
 alenic: Hi! I'm guessing if is it possible to use multithreading in coding game...
 VizGhar: euler once told me, that you sure can, but CG will only give you 1 core&#160;:)
 z64555: but is it hyperthreaded? :D
 alenic: oh thanks
 MSmits: i think hyperthreading is possible
 MSmits: someone one said it was
 MSmits: probably wont help much
 VizGhar: can somebody make a quick experiment? I'm busy right now (but still curious)
 alenic: I should verify it
 z64555: yeah, uh. I really don't recommend a multitasking OS in a single file, at any rate
 VizGhar: why not?
 z64555: I find it easier to manage objects and interfaces when they have their own files for implementation, rather than have it all mushed together.
 1br0n: the gift
 z64555: If all that abstraction is already done for you with the library, then more power to you
 z64555: yeah. I thought so...
 z64555: Uh. There's been a bug with the cerr and cout for C++ in the refree... sad to see it's been here for *3 years*
 z64555: if you have too much data spewing through cerr, it disrupts the timing of cout
 z64555: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/iv2KUuc">https://imgur.com/iv2KUuc</a>

 z64555: Ok, solved that. Stuck in an infinite loop and ignored input -_-
 alenic: I tried multitrheading in c++, but doesn't seems to give benefits
 karimk123: maybe because you arent running somethinf very heavy on it
 proogrmr: hey  can i put my own drawing in my contribution (clash of code)&#160;?

 BlaiseEbuth: don't know :grin:

 gimir: Isn't the dungeon-and-maps puzzle test case03 output weird?
 gimir: map index is 0
 gimir: But shouldn't the index be greater than 0?
 karimk123: can someone explain what does print(*a) do?
 karimk123: in python
 karimk123: where a is a string
 z64555: what does * ordinarily do?
 proogrmr: when a is list then if we use print(a) it will print let us say [1,2,3] if we use *a it will print        
 proogrmr: when it is string
 proogrmr: then it will print characters seperated by spaces i think
 karimk123: oh ok thanks
 karimk123: so its better than usinf " ".join(a)

 zhoubou: Error 404
 TheBarnacle: Not sure if you're asking anyone, but that's "unauthorized"
 MSmits: ah crap
 MSmits: it's a contribution replay
 darkhorse64: If a picture is not OK, use a thousand words
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: just reacted on the contribution
 MSmits: with pic
 MSmits: what happened was exactly what i predicted
 MSmits: draw detection bugged out because it can now end 1 turn later
 MSmits: he should just check if the top row is full
 darkhorse64: my depth solving messages are also wrong because I use piece count for ply but it has no other impact so I won't fix
 darkhorse64: I have seen one draw until now
 MSmits: yeah thats not really important
 MSmits: seen a rare few
 MSmits: draws may happen more often with corner move
 MSmits: or not, no idea
 darkhorse64: We should see more now
 darkhorse64: Too late
 MSmits: well the game is more balanced
 MSmits: for sure
 MSmits: but might still be in favor of p1. Hard to say
 MSmits: I have hardcoded corner start now
 MSmits: and always steal
 MSmits: pretty easy to do
 darkhorse64: Same
 MSmits: at first i was shocked... oh no my solver is bugged
 MSmits: i am used to bugs being my fault
 MSmits: but it was a contribution bug :P
 darkhorse64: I like the steal animation. I will probably steal the code
 MSmits: if breaks when you switch frames too fast
 MSmits: it
 eulerscheZahl: so you have a game in planning darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64:  Yes. Ataxx unless someone does it first. Nothing concrete for the moment but I would like to have some fancy anims if it is no too hard to code
 eulerscheZahl: depends on how fancy
 eulerscheZahl: as fancy as in the last official contest: will be hard
 darkhorse64: But I wonder if it's politically correct to issue a game that is also called Infection
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a problem
 darkhorse64: When you perform a move, it converts all neighbourhood to its color like a plague. It would be nice to have some anims here. Of course, FC 2020 is way beyond my SDK skills 
 eulerscheZahl: if the animation is just slowly changing the color: very easy
 eulerscheZahl: expanding the area with something that isn't just a boring straight line: easy if you find some sprites to show
 eulerscheZahl: or if you are a good artist yourself
 struct: Yeah, when I did yavalath the color change was done by mistake
 darkhorse64: I'd like my chip to spit a drop of color towards the neighbours
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more thinking about some water-like substance flowing from a field to its neighbors
 darkhorse64: I am a coder not an artist
 eulerscheZahl: with edges that have some structure
 eulerscheZahl: a bit like the ground transitions from vindinium
 darkhorse64: It should look like Doom lime, a poisonous thing

 UnnamedCodinGamer: hello, I submitted only a solution to test 10 (standard test set 20) in same game, which is identical to validators 20 and 40. I however get more than double the result on submit. Has anyone tested this
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: acat thought it would be a good idea to have each of the standard testsets twice
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes I see
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but I get more than double the result
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this is strange
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/847363c996b5db478bdbf6bf192c2535825e84">https://www.codingame.com/demo/847363c996b5db478bdbf6bf192c2535825e84</a>test the single validators here
 UnnamedCodinGamer: 9672 - result after submit 2*4735 is the actual result
 UnnamedCodinGamer: also in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: so you are saying that you hardcoded that one testcase and fail the others?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 eulerscheZahl: then i don't know. my scores matched with my offline results
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you get 1 point for each failed or something like that
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 eulerscheZahl: may the source be with you
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I can send you the solution to test
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but it would be the same
 UnnamedCodinGamer: strange
 eulerscheZahl: meh, i feel too lazy to really look into it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: bonus points for failed tests - that should be it
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: At least you tried
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this might suggest that the scores in the leader board are not correct
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/acatai/SameGame/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/engine/GameState.java">https://github.com/acatai/SameGame/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/engine/GameState.java</a>i don't see that 1 point in the score
 eulerscheZahl: but i feel visually insulted by the indentation
 UnnamedCodinGamer: in the IDE it is the correct score 4735.  Upon submit validators 20 and 40 light green and the score obtained is 9672
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, seems a bit off
 eulerscheZahl: if you play another testcase, is there a score too?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have tried it with standard test 20 only
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I can try others
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you have a fixed click sequence without testing if you face the correct testcase even?
 eulerscheZahl: and get some lucky hits
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think it is the correct tests (20 and 40) which light green I have checked in the documentation that they are identical to test 10 in the IDE (the hard coded one)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ahaa
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see what you mean
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this should be it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: first moves bring points in some of the other tests
 UnnamedCodinGamer: case closed then I guess
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it makes sense to cancel the score on invalid move
 DomiKo: not for begginers
 DomiKo: not canceling it is really beginner friendly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm, given that the test itself is failed and does not count
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know what the best behavior would be either
 eulerscheZahl: same for 2048. invalid action = failed?or even require the 2048 tile?
 DomiKo: each one has its own pros and cons
 Kitkat260: hi
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 Kitkat260: how are you guys doing
 UnnamedCodinGamer: 2048 required would have been nice
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but then, this would exclude some solutions
 Kitkat260: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i had an error in my thinking: you can have &gt; 0 points and still fail the testcase
 eulerscheZahl: so it would be possible to have a leaderboard for those who don't pass
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i thought the bottom of the leaderboard would all have a score of 0
 Kitkat260: does anyone want to be my friend
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like a job for Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i dont know how to improve my code
 Uljahn: are you a girl, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: wait till you get to know the difference

 SPDene: you might need to reinstall addon/extensions etc
 SPDene: oh 
 SPDene:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: will i lose my bookmarks?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i can export them
 SPDene: not sure - i rarely use chrome so if i ever have to reset it, i don't care
 eulerscheZahl: chromium*
 eulerscheZahl: reset succeeded, font still unreadable
 SPDene: ouch
 Westicles: call IT
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I know that font
 eulerscheZahl: i installed it to create the Onitama logo
 eulerscheZahl: i'll apt purge&#160;:/
 Warphi: isnt chromium the browser you get from viruses
 eulerscheZahl: purge worked. but now the default language is German again despite my operating system being in English
 eulerscheZahl: :rage:
 jacek: purge in German? :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, was just google with IP location
 PhantomJelly_c554: can someone give me some tips on the stock exchange losses puzzle in haskell? im stuck at the large database testcase
 jacek: youre brute forcing it, dont you
 PhantomJelly_c554: as im going trough the array i find the max and minimum and when one of these values change i substract the maximum from the minimum, i go trough the array only once is this the brute force?
 Kitkat260: hi
 Kitkat260: anyone here?

 Coartix: 70
 Kitkat260: ok nice
 Kitkat260: :worried:
 proogrmr: :p
 Kitkat260: hi people
 Astrobytes: Give it a rest will you.
 Kitkat260: what?!
 Astrobytes: Constantly saying 'hi' and mostly  meaningless drivel
 eulerscheZahl: nice, new vocabulary for me
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: my favorite from teacher Astrobytes is still lollygagging
 jacek: at least he doesnt break the c-c-c-combo
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl
 zhoubou: A new word for me :D
 eulerscheZahl: c-c-c-combo
 eulerscheZahl: have fun breaking this with combobreaker :P
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i ruined it before it even started
 Astrobytes: :D
 Jasperr: what's this "take" language lol
 Jasperr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/M96nXZP.png">https://i.imgur.com/M96nXZP.png</a>
 Jasperr: oh nvm now I see whats wrong
 Jasperr: stupid me triggered Google Translate, and somehow "Lua" translates to "take" in some language
 eulerscheZahl: you made me open a puzzle
 Jasperr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: take that
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps Jasperr around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/56014127626531" /> Jasperr: :o
 jacek: AutomatonNN take that
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 zhoubou: What's the difference between AutomatonNN and Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: yeah i'm going to go for the closest one
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is the best performance in the chat
 eulerscheZahl: NN pings me more often, that's thhe main difference
 zhoubou: Haha
 eulerscheZahl: and somtimes NN writes ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 zhoubou: o.o What is that char
 Astrobytes: You vandal!
 eulerscheZahl: no idea. but it's huge
 zhoubou: You broke chat lol
 Astrobytes: hey, zhoubou, how's things?
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes complained about it so often, it lost any meaning to me
 zhoubou: Astrobytes Doing well I suppose I can say. How about you?
 ChrisSkyRo: why would you type  ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤&#160;?
 zhoubou: Noo stahp
 Astrobytes: About the same. Starting the new year with full covid lockdown&#160;:/
 ChrisSkyRo:  ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 zhoubou: Yeah, that's pretty rough&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: we are still at 2 households, 5 persons
 eulerscheZahl: and high infection rates
 Astrobytes: We should have either extended the initial lockdown or done this one sooner
 eulerscheZahl: and here we are doing an incomplete one
 eulerscheZahl: either do it properly or give up
 Astrobytes: we've had a 4/5 tier system in place. Utterly useless.
 Astrobytes: People constantly breaking the rules all year. They all thought the virus had taken a summer holiday presumably.
 zhoubou: I'm also worried people will refuse to vaccinate
 Astrobytes: Many already are.
 eulerscheZahl: acceptance will go up over time
 Astrobytes: I can understand the hesitation as the regulatory process was sped up, but what else can you do in a pandemic?
 eulerscheZahl: probably faster than new vaccines can be produced
 Astrobytes: And hopefully it's still effective.
 zhoubou: I'm kind of afraid of a new strain that will diverge significantly and nullify the vaccine.
 eulerscheZahl: for flu there's a new vaccine every year. and not totally effective
 eulerscheZahl: that would be the worst case
 Astrobytes: Yes, it might end up like that. Might be better. Might even be worse.
 zhoubou: But good thing is, I don't worry too much about it. What happens happens. We will get through this like many other events in history.
 Astrobytes: At least we live in exciting times&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more worried about climate change
 Astrobytes: For me the scariest part has been the poor response from both government and the general public.
 Astrobytes: Yes eulerscheZahl, and more new viruses are also a side effect of that.
 zhoubou: How so?
 Astrobytes: Displacement of wildlife/people mostly.
 zhoubou: Oh, I see
 zhoubou: Haven't thought about it that way
 eulerscheZahl: interesting thought
 Astrobytes: We come into contact with things we would never have previously. Also with rising moisture/heat, some can grow stronger.
 Astrobytes: Or survive longer.
 Astrobytes: And melting of glaciers/ice shelves etc can of course release unknown pathogens
 zhoubou: Climate change is more worrying the more I look into it
 Astrobytes: It's been worrying me since I discovered it as a child in the 80s if I'm totally honest.
 zhoubou: It will be the true test to humanity
 zhoubou: I mean, it already is ongoing test
 Astrobytes: We already have massively reduced insect populations, that's a problem.
 zhoubou: Yeah, something not a lot of people pay attention to
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 Astrobytes: Check this out:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/16/birds-falling-out-of-the-sky-in-mass-die-off-in-south-western-us-aoe">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/16/birds-falling-out-of-the-sky-in-mass-die-off-in-south-western-us-aoe</a>
 zhoubou: Wow, that's pretty horrible.
 Astrobytes: Yep. Truly starved to death. All fat reserves gone and muscle mass depleted until they just die in mid-flight. 
 Astrobytes: Anyway, sorry for all the additional doom and gloom!
 zhoubou: Well, we need a bit of it here and there just to remember we are alive but fragile.
 zhoubou: If we don't, we will go about our daily lives without realizing the consequences of our actions.
 Astrobytes: As we mostly have throughout fairly recent history sadly.
 zhoubou: Was just about say something like that. Yeah.
 jacek: on the bright side, i discovered i can regulate upper shelf in my dishwasher. i was so stupid to wash my big plates manually
 zhoubou: Congrats lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: pro tip: eat with your hands to wash less forks and knives
 zhoubou: Savage life is economical
 jacek: inedia is cheap <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia</a>
 VizGhar: I have more recommendations, but I fear moderators :D
 eulerscheZahl: there are too many of them recently, always scares me
 Astrobytes: Moderators or Breathanarians?
 Astrobytes: (or whatever they're called)
 eulerscheZahl: mods. and now imagine if jacek would have accepted too
 VizGhar: don't know what the second one is but it sounds even scarier
 Astrobytes: lol, from jacek's link
 eulerscheZahl: they are not scary
 zhoubou: They are dead
 eulerscheZahl: the think they can live from sunlight alone
 eulerscheZahl: so you can probably fight them with 1 hand
 Astrobytes: If jacek had accepted mod this chat would be pure chaos :D
 jacek: cant they?
 Astrobytes: Try it and see...
 Maxim251: |D Such exotick font :D
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/wg533p">https://prnt.sc/wg533p</a>
 eulerscheZahl: if you want that experience too, search for "SF Shai Fontai"
 Astrobytes: It is quite a pleasing font.
 eulerscheZahl: i totally recommend that for your IDE
 eulerscheZahl: monospace is overrated
 Astrobytes: :D
 zhoubou: Have that as a challenge
 Astrobytes: I'm afraid of new fonts ever since I made my browser display all code snippets at microscopic size just because I installed a new one to try out in VS.
 Astrobytes: CG IDE included. Pre-Monaco.
 Astrobytes: Can't remember which font it was, I've since installed another one which was fine.
 zhoubou: Pre-Monaco?
 eulerscheZahl: ACE editor
 eulerscheZahl: CG changed a few months ago
 Astrobytes: ^
 zhoubou: Ah, ok.
 eulerscheZahl: as i copy-paste my code anyways, i don't have a real preference
 eulerscheZahl: wait, that sounds wrong
 Illedan: :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: hey Illedan
 Illedan: yo
 Astrobytes: how's things?
 Hiker: guys, illedan and eulerschezahl
 MSmits: hey! I too want to know the status of Illedan's things. Been a while
 Illedan: Started a new job today, got myself a turntable, baby due in 14 days and life is good&#160;:)
 MSmits: wow nice
 Astrobytes: Awesome stuff.
 Hiker: i am trying to solve 2048 puzle , c#. but i have random timeouts.i implemented BFS, limited by time. and every try i got time limit in 2-3 tests
 Astrobytes: A turntable? You have a large vinyl collection?
 eulerscheZahl: and team for annual hashcode disappointment is ready too :P
 jacek: Hiker try to limit to 30-35ms
 Illedan: Nah, I have 3 vinyls
 Illedan: haha euler
 Illedan: This year we got it!
 Illedan: Last year was a bug on me :P 
 Hiker: i changed my limit 30 -&gt; 25-&gt; 15... and it still not passing all tests. Is it GC&amp;
 Hiker: and how you control it?
 Illedan: What depth are you looking at? And what depth are you checking the time at?
 wlesavo: Hiker still may be your implementation is the issue
 jacek: timeout could be a crash
 wlesavo: nice things illedan :slight_smile:
 Illedan: Anyone know if I have to host React? Can't I just drop some static files like in Vue?&#160;:(
 Hiker: depth is not limited, my algo: while used time &lt;= N get first state in queue, simulate 4 possible moves and enqueue new states
 Hiker: and once at 50 ticks i have 1 simulation 10+ ms, instead od &lt;1
 Astrobytes: New job is React-based Illedan? (I don't know btw)
 Illedan: yeah
 darkhorse64: Do you a pool of states&#160;?
 MSmits: do you work at facebook?
 darkhorse64: *have*
 Illedan: nope
 MSmits: didnt they invent react?
 Illedan: sure
 Hiker: so i have 99,9% of one step simulations at &lt;1ms and 0.1 with 10+ ms. i think  GC is called and take 10ms
 MSmits: i did a react course once from you tube.To create a voting app
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm not ok with all those little function files
 MSmits: too confusing
 darkhorse64: Hiker: hence my question
 MSmits: opposite of CG
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: you like that 1 big file?
 MSmits: well no not that big, but bigger than 10 lines :P
 Illedan: I had a period in my dev life where I wanted to make everything as small as possible. Damn, the amount of abstractions I ended with :P
 MSmits: yeah, my brain cant deal with abstracting over so many files
 Astrobytes: With exceedingly long function names is how Smits likes it.void SomebodySendHelpICantGetThisOneToWorkProperly(uint64_t&amp; state);
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: btw, cant we share leaderboard replays for contributions either?
 MSmits: otherwise i want to share a loss to darkhorse64
 Illedan: Loss where?
 jacek: record it :v
 Illedan: What are you doing?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/519932672">https://www.codingame.com/replay/519932672</a>
 MSmits: connect 4 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv">https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv</a>
 jacek: not authorized
 MSmits: aw crap
 Illedan: Isn't connect 4 solved?
 MSmits: I just thought it was cool my bot knew it lost at ply 31
 jacek: its 9x7
 MSmits: (out of 60)
 Astrobytes: that still makes me laugh jacek
 darkhorse64: You're celebrating your only loss to me&#160;?
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: good one jacek
 jacek: did you see the comments
 zhoubou: :rofl:
 MSmits: so many good ones
 darkhorse64: you kniew you were losing one turn before me
 darkhorse64: *knew*
 MSmits: cool&#160;:)
 jacek: oh, theres steal in c4?
 darkhorse64: fix your bot
 darkhorse64: msmits: did you improve your bot's performance&#160;? You are ptredicting the outcome 2 or 3 plies before me whereas we were on par before
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: on phone brb
 jacek: how many simulations you can do
 darkhorse64: C4&#160;? 3.2 M rollouts first turn
 darkhorse64: depends on the server
 Kitkat260: hey i'm back
 derp22: hey back im new
 Kitkat260: nice to meet you
 derp22: you too
 Kitkat260: want to be frends
 derp22: sure
 Kitkat260: i just followed you
 derp22: i did the same
 Kitkat260: ok
 Kitkat260: how old r u
 derp22: 23 and you?
 Kitkat260: 14 1/2
 derp22: yeah i had a feeling you're quite young
 Westicles: heh heh
 Kitkat260: hey west don't laugh
 Kitkat260: hey derp
 Kitkat260: well
 Kitkat260: gtg
 derp22: lol okay cya
 MSmits: hey darkhorse64, about the solver. I think if your bot searches better (converges better on a good move), it also solves better
 MSmits: so even if your bot has more iterations
 MSmits: mine will solve more quickly
 MSmits: I didn't improve it, since the first day
 MSmits: (not after i started meta mcts)
 Astrobytes:  /humblebrag
 MSmits: sorry :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 darkhorse64: Yeah, in your loss your bot is only one ply ahead
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: it also varies
 MSmits: sometimes trictrac is 3 plies sooner than me
 MSmits: sometimes i am 1 ply sooner
 trictrac: Hello MSmits, that's pruning but it's dangerous
 darkhorse64: We are three enough for approval
 trictrac: Ok for approval no problem
 MSmits: tric trac you prune moves that you're not sure of?
 MSmits: oh, can we approve now?
 MSmits: never approved a contribution before
 jacek: you dont have that quest eh
 MSmits: mmh not sure
 MSmits: havent looked at the quest thingy
 MSmits: maybe i approved a clash or puzzle
 Stilgart: lucky man
 Stilgart: statistically, you reject one
 MSmits: maybe thats what i did
 Astrobytes: trictrac: Slightly off-topic but since your Fireworks contribution has been overshadowed by the festive season will you bring it back if it is not approved?
 darkhorse64: just click and farm XP. You have done enough 
 MSmits: kk
 trictrac: yes, i tried a deep pruning, if the eval  is too bad, I keep this low deep eval 
 MSmits: mmh i cant approve? Only upvote?
 Stilgart: sounds like a WIP
 MSmits: yeah
 trictrac: hello astrobytes, for fireworks i was waiting for remarks
 darkhorse64: deep or shallow&#160;? Yes upvote, this multi deserves more. The author has been very responsive
 MSmits: i mean i already upvoted
 Stilgart: allowing public WIPs was a bad idea imho&#160;:(
 MSmits: it has 10 upvotes
 Astrobytes: trictrac: I've not had much time for playing anything recently, I was hoping to try it and others very soon.
 MSmits: it's a good contribution
 darkhorse64: Some have 250+
 MSmits: wow
 darkhorse64: troll vs castle
 MSmits: I mean it suffers from the same problem as other simple board game multis, but compared to games like othello, uttt, bandas it's, it's fine
 trictrac: astrobyte&#160;: i can keep in wip fireworks one more month
 MSmits: there's a bit of a stigma on connect 4 because it's solved for smaller sizes, but that's undeserved
 Astrobytes: trictrac: Good, I think it deserves a chance. The contribution section is just so full I believe people have not seen it or forget about it.
 MSmits: havent seen fireworks
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: I am ignoring it
 Stilgart: from time to time, a notification makes too much noise and I go voting
 trictrac: I think that's a good think to propose coop game (like code a la mode). It's different from board game
 Stilgart: pretty sad situation&#160;:/
 MSmits: trictrac agreed, there should be variety
 Stilgart: trictrac: beware of "CoK-effect"
 MSmits: I dont have the time to try it out right now though, connect4 was really easy and fast to code
 Astrobytes: trictrac: I agree.Stilgart: Yes it is indeed.
 MSmits: this seems complicated at first glance
 trictrac: not so much, you have full information on cards of coop players and they give you partial  information on your cards @ each turn
 trictrac: a dilema @ each turn, give information to coop player, play a card to create fireworks or discard a card with no information on it&#160;?
 MSmits: no i dont mean it's too complicated to understand. I just mean, complicated to make a good bot
 MSmits: I made connect 4 in a few hours or so
 MSmits: and it's a pretty strong bot already. Never been that quick before
 Westicles: Yeah, but your whole life has been building up to that&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol, you're not even wrong :P
 MSmits: fireworks looks very interesting
 MSmits: still not getting it though
 MSmits: lemme reread it a few times
 jthemphill: @MSmits "I mean it suffers from the same problem as other simple board game multis"
 MSmits: no, I should not have said "problem", it's more like "problems" multiple. It varies per game, but mostly it's a consequence of the game being simple
 MSmits: it's not really mcts related
 MSmits: the problem with simple games is that bots play nearly perfectly
 jthemphill: ah, got it
 MSmits: one mistake somewhere is going to decide how the game ends
 Northbeach: :poop:
 MSmits: but thats only really a problem when the best players face off
 MSmits: with 100 players in a board, thats usually top 10
 jthemphill: what's the problem with one mistake deciding a game?
 jthemphill: is it that it introduces variance?
 MSmits: well bots can be relatively deterministic, especially if they are good
 MSmits: what happens is that 1 bot makes the mistake in one gamestate and the other doesnt, then the other always wins
 MSmits: and you get these rock paper scissors situation
 MSmits: where player A always beatsB, B always beats C, C always beats A
 Astrobytes: No real competition, as it were
 MSmits: then whoever submits a lot, influences the board most
 MSmits: and the player that is weak to this player, drops
 jthemphill: is the RPS problem avoidable?
 MSmits: the more complicated and random a game, the less it happens i think
 jthemphill: MaRo of M:tG fame claims that all unsolved games have an RPS meta
 MSmits: oh and another thing
 MSmits: if the game has a fixed start, opening books will be quite good in simple games
 jthemphill: otherwise everyone would just adopt the "best" strat
 MSmits: well to some degree I suppose
 MSmits: but not every game is the same like that
 MSmits: uttt barely has a RPS
 jthemphill: i've heard people here say that uttt is mostly about writing the fastest code you can rather than thinking through heuristics - is that why you say it barely has an RPS?
 MSmits: the fact that there are relatively few heuristics that work is a good reason it has little RPS
 jthemphill: got it
 Stilgart: RPS&#160;?
 MSmits: rock paper scissors
 MSmits: player A beat B, B beat C, C beat A
 MSmits: whoever submits, decides the order on the leaderboard
 MSmits: aka, submit spam is effective
 Stilgart: aka, CG
 Stilgart: got it&#160;:(
 MSmits: yes but not for every game the same
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: in uttt submit spam doesnt work very well
 Stilgart: what&#160;?!
 Westicles: That's why the optims are the best thing here
 Stilgart: on bad days, my rank is multiplied by 2
 Stilgart: at UTTT
 MSmits: thats not because of RPS
 MSmits: thats just random
 MSmits: at least, it could be, i did not research your case
 Stilgart: why not RPS&#160;?
 MSmits: because the top 10-30 in uttt is almost exactly the same strength
 MSmits: so 1 extra lost or won game can change your rank dramatically
 Stilgart: how you use your random is a strat
 MSmits: thats not RPS 
 Stilgart: but you ar eright
 MSmits: no i mean, the fact that you win or lose is random
 MSmits: against similarly ranked players
 Stilgart: the issue is more about balande 
 Stilgart: balance*
 MSmits: yes p1 vs p2
 MSmits: uttt would be sooo much better with steal
 jthemphill: steal?
 jthemphill: is that a variant?
 Astrobytes: The SDK awaits you MSmits...
 MSmits: p2 has the choice of taking over p1's move
 jthemphill: whoa
 MSmits: so p1 plays the best move
 MSmits: p2 will stea lit
 jthemphill: oh to mitigate p1 advantage
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: so p1 plays a balanced move
 MSmits: and the game gets interesting
 MSmits: and it's no longer "p1 always wins"
 Stilgart: do we know what these moves are in uttt&#160;?
 jthemphill: maybe it incentivizes opening books more? p1 wants to play an offbeat move that they've studied
 MSmits: i can find out fairly easily, but some are near 50% yeah
 MSmits: top board, center square maybe
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eeb61f5f-b0db-458f-87ab-1f8392f6b597">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eeb61f5f-b0db-458f-87ab-1f8392f6b597</a>
 MSmits: or top board, corner
 Stilgart: MSmits: but my computer suffers enough by compiling electron&#160;:)
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: I have an error with putStrLn can someone help me pls?
 MSmits: jthemphill well yeah but someone will figure this out and other players will just copy their starting move
 Stilgart: wow, some haskell error
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: yea&#160;:/
 MSmits: jthemphill other than that opening books are not very effective in uttt
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: No instance for (Num String)
 MSmits: especially if it will have 15 starts with the steal option
 Stilgart: putStrLn  $ loss_calculator $ read input
 Stilgart: i guess...
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: putStrLn  $ (loss_calculator input) the error is caused by this line
 Stilgart: my guess is that input is a string
 DomiKo: For the first time ever I got exactly the same score as the boss, and I'm second...
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: read input doesnt work
 MSmits: Stilgart what is electron?
 Stilgart: you might want to get read of the stupid(est among stupid) default code
 Stilgart: and use this instead
 Astrobytes: It's most likely less DomiKo, the display is truncated
 Stilgart: input &lt;- readLn&#160;:: IO Int
 Stilgart: MSmits: no idea... but vscode is made of it
 jthemphill: @NinjaFrenchman_e492 you probably need to call `show` to transform a Num into a String
 MSmits: ohh ok

 MSmits: everything is made of electrons :P
 Stilgart: took several hours to be build&#160;:(
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: i did but it still gives an error
 Stilgart: so it was the other way around
 Stilgart: putStrLn -&gt; print&#160;?
 jthemphill: @MSmits Electron is a UI toolkit that's basically just the Chromium browser. It lets you write native apps with JS/HTML
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Stilgart: (sounds strange, though)
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: idk
 Stilgart: we might need to see all the main function
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/stock-exchange-losses">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/stock-exchange-losses</a> this is the proble if you have the time to take a look at it
 jthemphill: @NinjaFrenchman_e492 Maybe putStrLn (show (loss_calculator input))
 Stilgart: but again, get rid of the default code
 Stilgart: using it is at best a nightmare
 MSmits: Astrobytes you think it would be a good idea to add UTTT with steal in the SDK&gt;
 MSmits: or were you kidding about that?
 Stilgart: for multis, it is even impossible
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: putStrLn $ show $ loss_calculator input this does not work
 Westicles: Haskell eh?  Did you add the usual Peano contruction?

 jthemphill: @NinjaFrenchman_e492 don't put two dollar signs on the same line
 jthemphill: start by nesting parens until it compiles, then switch to point-free if you want to be stylish
 Stilgart: what a poor day&#160;:(
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: dont even get started on that :D
 NinjaFrenchman_e492: thank for the help&#160;:)
 DomiKo: Wow so sad that Bit Runner didn't get much more attention
 DomiKo: That game is so cool
 MSmits: it got a lot of attention actually
 MSmits: but it's quite a hard game
 MSmits: they had a mini-contest on release
 MSmits: which re curse won with a neural network
 MSmits: I didn't even get out of the "gold"  league (the one right before the highest). I admit I gave up soon, but not without trying a lot of things
 DomiKo: I would guess that every bot in wood 1 is NN
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: people got in without them
 DomiKo: It's only 5 of them
 MSmits: at the end of the contet only re curse had a NN in wood 1 I think, maybe people wrote more later on
 DomiKo: ohhh
 MSmits: the boss of wood 2 is a normal bot
 MSmits: it's just pretty good
 MSmits: I should say really good, pb4 wrote it
 DomiKo: That game is similar to CSB, but hmmm
 MSmits: it was actually inspired by CSB
 DomiKo: but that small circle
 DomiKo: is so much fun
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: my problem was I didn't know what to eval
 DomiKo: that idea is so clever
 DomiKo: and that's interesting
 MSmits: i am guessing there are a few more games you havent tried that are interesting&#160;:)
 DomiKo: If I remember correctly, someone in Fantastic Bits made a "template" where you have to write only eval.
 DomiKo: That could work here too
 MSmits: that was csb, but maybe FB as well
 MSmits: yeah, but that's basically the only thing i dont need, a template :P
 MSmits: but for others sure.
 DomiKo: yeah
 DomiKo: In hard games that's the problem
 MSmits: oh right, it would fix the hard part
 DomiKo: people would write something cool, but that take a lof of time
 MSmits: I think illedan may have written something for bit runner?
 MSmits: at least he did a video?
 DomiKo: I don't know&#160;:/
 DomiKo: "i am guessing there are a few more games you havent tried that are interesting " 
 MSmits: well we have so many
 DomiKo: I would even say that a lot of them
 MSmits: yeah i guess it depends on your preferences
 MSmits: also some games have serious problems with balance and such, but are still interesting to code a bot for
 MSmits: you just wont have a reliable leaderboard
 MSmits: or it just looks cool to see your bot work
 DomiKo: Some games are so nice to watch
 MSmits: for example, locam has gotten a lot of hate for parts of it, but i enjoyed it for about 2 weeks
 MSmits: and it looks good
 DomiKo: I hate Code of Kutulu
 DomiKo: Leaderboard is so random
 MSmits: hmm it's ok, but it's nasty to code a sim for, it's a looooot of work
 DomiKo: but It's nice to watch
 MSmits: it's fairly random, but the top is not completely unreliable
 MSmits: blasterpoard won the contest and is still up there
 MSmits: I beat illedan by less than 0.01 rating at the contest (invisible decimal). Was a nervewracking recalc&#160;:)
 DomiKo: It's relatively easy to write a good bot, but hard to master it
 MSmits: yea
 DomiKo: So often I'm impressed how much people could master games here
 MSmits: do you mean how many people or to what degree they master it?
 DomiKo: Both
 MSmits: well competition really drives quality
 MSmits: if you look at who participates, there are some seriously good competitors
 DomiKo: And it's still running
 DomiKo: yeah
 MSmits: we even have some famous competitors sometimes
 MSmits: sometimes this guy joins: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Korotkevich">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Korotkevich</a>
 DomiKo: A*Craft
 DomiKo: I believe
 MSmits: he won A*craft yeah
 MSmits: but we beat his bot at code a la mode (though i doubt he gave a serious try)
 DomiKo: But I beat him in go karts&#160;;)
 MSmits: go karts?
 DomiKo: go-karts
 DomiKo: Like in real world
 DomiKo: :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: wait, do you mean you karted against him?
 DomiKo: yeah
 MSmits: haha
 MSmits: thats awesome
 struct: I had no idea that the writer of the bitboard pdf that is shared here was yavalath creator
 MSmits: oh i seem to remember that struct,
 MSmits: i did notice
 DomiKo: "bitboard pdf that is shared"&#160;?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279031895_Bitboard_Methods_for_Games">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279031895_Bitboard_Methods_for_Games</a>
 DomiKo: O.o
 DomiKo: I didn't notice too
 MSmits: think i exhausted that one by now, but I should keep checking that pdf when i do new games
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336101137_Learning_Policies_from_Self-Play_with_Policy_Gradients_and_MCTS_Value_Estimates">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336101137_Learning_Policies_from_Self-Play_with_Policy_Gradients_and_MCTS_Value_Estimates</a>
 struct: Might be interesting to read
 MSmits: will check it out
 MSmits: i hope one of these days I can find a fully featured and easy to understand parameter tuning program
 MSmits: with TD learning
 MSmits: I am too lazy to completely figure it out myself
 struct: Also in that pdf he mentions 4 games that are here
 struct: othello, yavalath, connect 4, breakthrough
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: when i have the time, i'll try to see if i can work something out for breakthrough
 MSmits: thats the one game in your list i really fail at
 MSmits: though my non-booked othello could be improved as well
 JLukeSkywalker: is the server dying for anyone else? tried to clash and took it like 10 minutes to verify a non-looping answer
 karliso: Why is hypersonic dead? I think 1x1 is as good as it gets for a game.
 struct: it isnt always 1vs1
 struct: Also having 50+ copy pasted bots from rank 3 on contest doenst help much
 karliso: Did I imply it is 1x1?
 DomiKo: "Also having 50+ copy pasted bots from rank 3 on contest doenst help much" He pasted the code?
 zhoubou: JLukeSkywalker I am also experiencing this. It almost always happens around this time.
 struct: yes, code is public DomiKo
 struct: sorry karliso but is what i understood from the 1x1 part of your message
 DomiKo: that's sad&#160;:(
 karliso: struct I see, well I mentioned 1x1 specifically because it has other parts that are not as good (1x1x1).
 MSmits: yeah thats a flaw of HS
 MSmits: it is an otherwise interesting game though
 MSmits: and the shared code can be beaten
 MSmits: plenty of people rank above the gith bots
 DomiKo: He is current in 65 place, so not that high
 MSmits: also HS is an ex-contest game. They are almost all dead, all the time
 MSmits: the fact that some people still start HS and make bots there, is actually a good sign
 struct: Yeah, you can beat the shared bot
 MSmits: most multis are entirely ignored
 struct: The rank starts around ~10-20
 MSmits: yeah it's like 50-100 identical bots
 MSmits: more or less
 MSmits: so when you get past them, your rank goes up very quickly
 DomiKo: Yeah we can see there <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics">https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics</a>
 DomiKo: There isn't really traffic
 struct: Also most of them dont even bothered to remove the N ms
 DomiKo: They don't know how lmao
 MSmits: there doesnt really have to be traffic. The nice thing about CG is that you can play asynchronously. You can beat a 2 year old bot if you want
 MSmits: and if you all want to work on the same multi, there's usually a new one thats popular, or an old one that came back
 struct: good thing about shared bot is that you can run brutal tester against it
 struct: so faster games 
 MSmits: you mean as opposed to cg bench
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: true
 struct: bench you have to wait 20 sec
 MSmits: it also stresses the server
 MSmits: better do it locally when you can
 karliso: yeah, but HS doesn't feel like typical contest game.
 MSmits: hmm well it was a long time ago, before i was on CG
 MSmits: my first one was code royale
 MSmits: btw what did you think about my idea to add steal option to uttt karliso?
 MSmits: i think it's not enough to make a new contribution for, so it's probably not gonna happen, but i do think it would improve the game a lort
 MSmits: lot
 karliso: exactly
 karliso: well, idk about improving
 MSmits: it would stop p1 from always winning
 MSmits: there might be other issues with uttt, but this is the biggest one
 MSmits: you might not even need the double swapped games anymore
 MSmits: assuming there is at least 1 balanced move
 karliso: yeah, idk
 struct: I  got asked by an user
 MSmits: I am assuming you also ran a meta mcts program or similar, so you've seen some moves are way more balanced
 struct: if I could port it and make the 1st move random
 struct: and remove the current draw rule
 MSmits: nah, random would be bad
 karliso: I have not run any meta mcts
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: you hardcoded moves by hand on your own then?
 MSmits: i mean when you still had a book?
 MSmits: that's brilliant karliso
 karliso: yeah, they were not necessarily good moves
 MSmits: they were fairly hard to beat, not bad moves at all
 MSmits: re curse *did* use a meta mcts to hard  code and i beat his with the same effort
 MSmits: struct what draw rule do you mean?
 struct: having more squares won that the opponent
 struct: only win condition should be 3 in a row
 MSmits: allright, but if you remove that the game would be worse
 MSmits: there would be more draws
 MSmits: because it's relatively easy to block 3 in a row
 MSmits: but not easy to also get equal number of won boards
 MSmits: if you did a steal version and kept the rest the same, there would be few draws and p1 and p2 would both win often
 karliso: 1st move random makes most sense, it would give game more depth as everyone is playing 4 4
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: it would be less balanced then
 MSmits: because a lucky start may still give you the win
 MSmits: and p1 is still favored A LOT
 MSmits: most starts are favored to p1
 DomiKo: random position and play two games
 DomiKo: one as P1 and one as P2
 MSmits: steal is better for balance
 MSmits: and gives less draws
 MSmits: draws as win both players win 1 game with swap
 MSmits: like it is now
 karliso: exactly, but even if random each move I don't see how it would become less balanced.
 MSmits: it would not become less balanced
 MSmits: but it is less balanced than a version with steal
 MSmits: because with steal, p1 is *forced* to pick the most balanced starting move
 MSmits: he has to, or p2 will steal it
 MSmits: so out of the 15 starts, the best one is chosen
 MSmits: the one with near 50% winrate
 MSmits: 4 4 has near 70% winrate for most bots
 MSmits: in your case 100% even
 MSmits: other starts have 55-60% and there are 1 or 2 that are near 50%
 MSmits: there is currently a connect4 contribution with exactly the same problem
 MSmits: I ran a meta mcts to test:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4d136503-1e3d-41d2-8983-39e2c9d05a7e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4d136503-1e3d-41d2-8983-39e2c9d05a7e</a>
 MSmits: creator implemented steal and now we all start with the corner move, because it is most balanced
 karliso: I will just say that I like the idea of random 1st move. It would enrich game with many more types of positions.
 MSmits: I agree with games being more varied and interesting yes
 karliso: Maybe connect4 can also do random 1st move?
 karliso: Less hardcoding.. more depth..
 MSmits: there are only 5 starting moves
 karliso: Still&#160;:)
 MSmits: I can hardcode the entire game no matter what
 MSmits: I can fit around 200k moves in codesize
 karliso: Can they not make the board larger? :D
 MSmits: they did
 MSmits: it's not solved this way
 MSmits: but it's reasonably close to it
 MSmits: if you took a month and a threadripper, you could do it i think
 MSmits: traditional is 6x7, this is 7x9
 MSmits: when a game is that close to being solved
 MSmits: bots play nearly perfectly
 MSmits: if the balance is off, its disastrous
 MSmits: that's why the steal
 MSmits: uttt is much further from being solved
 MSmits: so it being off balance is less of a problem (yet still a problem)
 MSmits: also, compare it with yavalath. It has extreme branching with 61 choices, yet the game is solved without steal
 MSmits: some games just need it
 MSmits: gonna go sleep, gn all
 proogrmr: gn

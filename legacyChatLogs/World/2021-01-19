 algoBit: @BouncyNoodle try some easy puzzles
 Horizontalx: amazjiAJRSBU
 BouncyNoodle_de77: Our lecturer asked us to try this, but i cant figure how... 
 Murleys: Play clashofcode
 Murleys: Thats all I do
 jacek: huh
 Uljahn: eww
 jacek: BouncyNoodle_de77 try some easy puzzle to figure out the input/output
 Horizontalx: #%^NJWP_O

 Passifi: bueans morning y'all 
 struct: morning
 Horizontalx: bruh stop human stuff
 LumpySausageOfWisdom_5447: may i knw who can solve the "terget firing" coding game?
 jacek: the author of the puzzle
 Stilgart: if it's not freecell, me I guess
 Stilgart: and 411 others
 Stilgart: as far as I remember, this one deserves the #readingComprehension tag
 Stilgart: fun fact, #readingTheStatement still exists
 JBM: what's the current state of the art in terms of unicode abuse to get code size under 100k on CG?
 MSmits: JBM I do the following:
 MSmits: say there are 5 different actions you can do and you want to store as many as possible
 jacek: keep in mind only unicode chars up to about 50k count as 1
 MSmits: I basically do  x * 5 ^0 + y * 5^1 + z * 5^2 etc. up to the max that fits in a unicode character
 MSmits: then i move to the next character
 JBM: a valid unicode character, or a theoretical 32-bit unicode character?
 MSmits: you could even fit an action partially inside a unicode char this way for some extra marginal gain
 MSmits: jacek do you cap it to 50k to be more efficient?
 MSmits: I go over 50k so i might lose some efficiency there
 jacek: yeah
 MSmits: mind you... i never actually needed this compression, but suppose I ever do
 MSmits: I just did it once to the point that i fitted about 30k moves and could have fitted like 120k more
 JBM: not sure i understood the 50k counting as 1 part
 JBM: is 50k = 0x20000?
 MSmits: some unicode characters use more bits
 MSmits: i guess
 struct: MSmits what do you think of forcing opening on othello?
 MSmits: or are they all max 16 bit?
 jacek: some unicode chars count as 2
 jacek: on CG
 JBM: they used to
 JBM: but haven't for a long time now
 MSmits: struct all first moves are identical
 JBM: ah, ok
 JBM: jacek: tell me more?
 struct: No I mean, force opening book for players
 struct: like TCEC
 JBM: same weird count as twitter?
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: ahh you mean a random opening struct?
 struct: not random
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/downloads/openingssmall.txt">http://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/downloads/openingssmall.txt</a>
 tomatoes: standart js/java strlen
 struct: +1 -1 openings
 algoBit: bash programmers can access files in computer where it runs. with error output&#160;? :p
 tomatoes: The length property of a String object contains the length of the string, in UTF-16 code units
 MSmits: what does the +1 and -1 mean?
 struct: the eval
 MSmits: oh, has to be a really good bot that does the eval then
 tomatoes: &lt;=3 bytes utf8 as 1, 4 bytes utf8 as 2
 MSmits: because that early in the game it's hard to say
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/aboutxot.php?lang=en">http://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/aboutxot.php?lang=en</a>
 jacek: xot8, for some tournaments there are 8 plies openings already done. those were analyzed deeply by engine to be more balances
 MSmits: struct it might be a good idea
 JBM: jacek: afaik, twitter is more or less 1 per codepoint, except 2 for chinese japanese korean
 MSmits: would kick me and old john off the top of the board
 MSmits: but thats fine
 MSmits: however, i am afraid it would crash many bots
 JBM: (U+1100 to U+10FFFF if this page I'm reading is correct)
 jacek: hmm
 wlesavo: you can make a second version of othello, i guess that would be a better way to have both
 MSmits: probably yes
 MSmits: I would prefer a new version of uttt myself
 MSmits: with steal for first move, or some other way to fix massive p1 advantage
 MSmits: if you do this, i'd ask CG though, you're basically copying one of theirs
 Westicles: According to DomiKo some even count for 3 characters
 tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/counting-characters">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/counting-characters</a> some tricky counting
 struct: im not a fan of having 2 versions
 struct: of the same game
 Westicles: That is why base256 is better than base65536
 MSmits: well preferably not, but if you take othello, which already has a small playerbase and change it, you'll be left with some bots that work and most of them crashing
 MSmits: Westicles base256 in CG will compress worse
 MSmits: so we kinda have to use those extra degrees of freedom
 MSmits: even though it is messy
 RoboStac: nothing in base65536 counts as 3
 RoboStac: at least in the implementation I'm using
 MSmits: doesnt that depend on CG RoboStac? Your implementation does not determine what counts as 3 and what doesnt
 RoboStac: I mean when checked on CG
 Westicles: Just quoting him from here, I always use base65k myself
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-10-10">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-10-10</a>
 MSmits: ah ok, well if you use the full range, then likely nothing counts as 3
 tomatoes: all utf8 maximum 2 (js strlen)
 JBM: ah thanks for the link at least
 JBM: i suppose i'll jjust try a bunch of them
 RoboStac: I've not found the exact cutoff, but using base65536 all 14bit values count as 1 byte, 16 bit values count as 2 bytes and somewhere in the middle of 15 bit it changes from 1 to 2
 MSmits: RoboStac jacek said around 50k value
 JBM: really gets me to wonder "how on earth are they counting on their side"
 MSmits: which if i remember correctly has a hole of about 2k wide with invalid characters. Maybe it's right above that hole&gt;
 tomatoes: surrogats
 JBM: some threshold on the utf8 conversion?
 Westicles: Have you tried Base32768?  That supposedly only uses 1 char ones, at least as far as twitter is concerned
 Flekysek: Can somebody help me? I am trying to create board for my game but I would like to let a player choose how big a board he will create. For this reason, I thought I will initialize board like static char**board; and then board = new char[size][size];
 MSmits: It should really not be that hard to figure out where the start of 2 char is. Just binary search it with a code colf or something
 MSmits: you'll need maybe 10 submits? 
 MSmits: or tests or whatever
 tomatoes: U+10000 and higher
 jacek: just write to codegolf puzzle
 jacek: it will count characters
 MSmits: yeah
 RoboStac: yeah, you don't even need to submit it shows on screen
 jacek: Flekysek that way works only if the size is known in compile time
 Flekysek: Ok I will send you PM 
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://qntm.org/safe">https://qntm.org/safe</a>
 Mahdi05: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://acmp.ru">https://acmp.ru</a>
 RoboStac: sounds like base32768 would be better, just with the extra pain of having to handle the length issues (either only storing 15 bit values or having to split values across codepoints)
 MSmits: you might still have to split values depending on what you're storing
 RoboStac: true, but at the moment I'm storing 16 bit values so base65536 is easy
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: I'm just saying because the one time i used unicode compression i stored 10 W/L/D values for bandas endgame in 1 character, that did not fit neatly
 JBM: is the code length measured in the same way for code golf and general puzzles?
 RoboStac: yeah
 Mahdi05: rfr cltkfnm njh rjl
 JBM: couldn't have said it better
 jacek: and then theres utf-16 le and utf16 be...
 Uljahn: Mahdi05: hints button on the left, click it
 JBM: please don't tell me it changes the length
 Mahdi05: As do Power of Thor
 struct: If I make a bot that places around ~10 in wood 1 and open the new league with the positions, would it be better?
 Bartolini188: can somebody explain me
 Bartolini188: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cadfa238-52e8-4b2d-93b4-6da9d6009db2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cadfa238-52e8-4b2d-93b4-6da9d6009db2</a>
 Bartolini188: what does f(t) means?
 Bartolini188: the code is supposed to transform one string to another by one character each time printing those
 MSmits: f(t)  means you run function f passing parameter t
 MSmits: apparently f is the input function
 RoboStac: it's using the fact that input("x") prints "x" before waiting for input, so if you call input(t) it's going to print t and then hang forever
 RoboStac: which is fine as that was the last line of needed output
 MSmits: and it's better to use input than print, because you got an alias for it
 MSmits: this reduces character count
 MSmits: pretty smart
 Bartolini188: well this was in short code competition, didn't knew you can print by input 
 Bartolini188: thanks a lot guys!
 Sentinel25B: im so bad at coding
 Sentinel25B:&#160;:(}
 MSmits: I'm sure there are people worse than you Sentinel25B
 Sentinel25B: totaly
 Sentinel25B: poker chip race and the puzzles are the only one i can do
 MSmits: poker chip race is not that easy
 MSmits: if you can do it, you can do many
 Sentinel25B: ya it is
 MSmits: probably you picked a few difficult ones
 Sentinel25B: weekly puzzles are the easier ones.
 MSmits: not necessarily I think. I have seen hard weeklies
 MSmits: but most puzzles are easy in general
 MSmits: easy being a relative concept of course
 Sentinel25B: well im using a trash computer
 Sentinel25B: school chromebooks probably arent ment for coding
 MSmits: dont think it matters much unless the program hangs and slows down
 MSmits: you should just pick a lightweight IDE
 Westicles: Chess approved... get on it MSmits
 MSmits: haha, not any time soon. Currently doing search race and code of the ring
 MSmits: i was wondering. Have people bothered trying to hardcode searchrace? 
 MSmits: if they haven't i won't try either
 kovi: it is hardcoded above recurse
 kovi: probably also some below
 kovi: recurse NN-ed it early
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: thanks. I'll try that if I get a good search going that competes with the top. Otherwise I won't bother
 kovi: i guess it needs finetunementcsb is just a base
 MSmits: well you can do better than csb, because no shield, only 1 pod
 kovi: (and no smitsimax advantage here)
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but thats also a disadvantage
 MSmits: I can just mcts it now
 MSmits: probably i'll mcts it first, then will try allowing more possibilities for the first few plies
 MSmits: then maybe combine mcts with SA somehow
 MSmits: anyways, that's my thoughts going in&#160;:)
 MSmits: it has some interesting possibilities for pruning also
 MSmits: since there is no interference from other pods
 kovi: 1player...so in my view its not ply/mcts...
 MSmits: there is single player mcts
 MSmits: i could say turn instead of ply 
 MSmits: single player mcts is almost the same as two player mcts, you just don't flip the sign when backpropagating
 darkhorse64: Zorg1 SR score is online
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: Go too, so not maximum performance
 MSmits: nicely done
 YurkovAS: my SR score is online
 MSmits: I wonder how re curse trained his NN. Because if he used the actual validators, it's also hardcoding... in a way
 darkhorse64: It requires lots of fine tuning. I used SA
 MSmits: how did you generate an initial solution?
 darkhorse64: Well 300 left to gain
 MSmits: and how to make sure you hit all the checkpoints when you change the solution?
 jrke: my SR is also online but not that good
 MSmits: I mean you can change one action in the chain, but you might miss a checkpoint
 darkhorse64: Fully random at start and my scoring takes care of the rest
 MSmits: Do you also give points for narrowly missed checkpoints?
 MSmits: like... make the checkpoints  "larger" at first and shrinking it?
 darkhorse64: No
 MSmits: so a missed checkpoint is just a completely failed solution with a low score?
 MSmits: just wondering how much the hit-and-miss characteristic of checkpoints will hurt converging on a good solution
 darkhorse64: Actually my sim checks the current checkpoint for collision. If it is hit, it will check for the next checkpoint and so on. Scoring counts the number of checkpoints plus the normalized distance to the next checkpoint
 MSmits: well that's exactly the eval i would use for mcts
 MSmits: but SA includes modifying a full solution, by changing an action halfway through
 darkhorse64: The checkpoint ordering is enforced by the sim
 MSmits: but when you change an action halfwaythrough, all the following actions may have to be adjusted
 darkhorse64: I have tried beam search, lahc also. Yeah, SA is a voodoo thing
 jrke: SR is CSB with 1 pod with no opponent
 MSmits: I also wonder if it is every worthwhile to pick a power between 0 and max
 MSmits: ever
 MSmits: a thrust i mean
 darkhorse64: It's a race, you know ... Not for wimps ...
 MSmits: haha of course
 MSmits: just looking for pruning opportunities
 jrke: i just look for 3 angles and 2 thrusts per depth angles are {-18, 0, 18} and thrust {0, 200} so 6 possible moves i have per depth 
 MSmits: in  csb i just use -18 0 18 for angles and 0 and 200 for thrust. I am 100% sure i need more angles, but not sure i need more thrusts
 MSmits: right, so thats the same as I do jrke
 darkhorse64: Looking at my scores, lahc is not far from sa but I clearly failed with bs
 MSmits: beamsearch would explode too quickly in this case
 MSmits: it's more useful for situations where the consequences of actions happen more quickly and where branching is relatively small
 MSmits: turning 180 degrees takes 10 turns
 darkhorse64: It's a new toy for me to play with
 MSmits: beamsearch wont manage that I think, unless you take the angle into account reliably
 YurkovAS: lahc?
 darkhorse64: late acceptance hill climbing
 jrke: my sim is just depth 7 with eval as distance to checkpoint angle to the checkpoint and checkpoint crossed for SR
 MSmits: you should be able to go much further than depth 7 i think
 MSmits: i use depth 7 in csb with 4 pods and more actions
 jrke: bad optimization cause i did that 2-3 months ago
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: which is like half your life ago :P
 MSmits: you're a new man
 jrke: 1/4 of my whole complete coding life which is 8 month(when i learned what is cout &lt;&lt;&#160;;)
 YurkovAS: jrke depth 10+ give more score in SR
 MSmits: awesomeness
 Westicles: Is there a cleverer way than this to get an NxNxNxNxN vector filled with -1 in c++?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05cf994b-e0dd-4b8a-afaf-697f03be88f8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05cf994b-e0dd-4b8a-afaf-697f03be88f8</a>
 MSmits: whoa
 <b>**MSmits can't say anything clever in the face of so many nested vectors</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I am assuming N is not fixed?
 Westicles: right, N is variable
 MSmits: but is it variable within some reasonable amount or does it vary wildly?
 MSmits: otherwise I would just create a fixed array
 MSmits: this does not look very performant
 jrke: what are bitboards ?can anyone..
 MSmits: jrke it's storing information in integers
 jrke: i don't know what are they yet
 jrke: something like gamestate in integers?
 MSmits: simple example
 MSmits: X X .O O .. . .
 MSmits: TT T board
 MSmits: you could use two separate boards for this
 MSmits: 1 for X
 MSmits: 1 for O
 MSmits: X would be 0b000000011
 jrke: 110110000
 MSmits: O would be 0b000001100
 MSmits: err
 MSmits: O would be 0b000011000
 MSmits: the 1's are occupied squares
 jrke: okay
 MSmits: the 0's are empty
 MSmits: I am counting 1 2 3
 MSmits: 4 5 6
 MSmits: 7 8 9
 MSmits: 1 being the first bit
 MSmits: (index 0, i should have picked i guess)
 MSmits: so 0 1 2
 MSmits: 3
 MSmits: 4
 MSmits: typing too fast sry
 jrke: got it
 MSmits: you can quickly adjust this bitboard with bit ops
 MSmits: to play a cross on the 3rd square and win
 MSmits: X would do
 MSmits: board |= 1 &lt;&lt; 2
 jrke: okay
 MSmits: because 1 &lt;&lt; 2 = 0b000000100
 MSmits: and that makes 3 in a row
 jrke: so are you using them in D&amp;B
 jrke:&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, but it's not really necessary 
 MSmits: i am just using it there because i am so used to them
 MSmits: though, it does give you the ability to make the gamestate very small
 MSmits: and then use a hashtable more effectively
 BigDickRick_69: :green_apple:
 MSmits: in D&amp;B I use 64 bit for all horizontal lines and a 64 bit integer for all vertical lines
 MSmits: so total 128 bit for the entire board
 jrke: my endgame times out if chains quantity are &gt; 12 or 13
 MSmits: does not surprise me, it's difficult
 jrke: using 3d arrayed int 'int map[7][7][4]'
 MSmits: I doubt the map is the problem. The problem is mostly the possible moves you allow
 MSmits: what you prune and don't prune
 MSmits: this game has dozens of pruning rules
 jrke: problem is only the map
 MSmits: why is that?
 MSmits: a single pruning rule can make your solver 4x faster
 jrke: 7*7*4 is takes too long to transfer from one func to another
 jrke: btww gtg cya
 jrke: nice talking
 MSmits: cya 
 jrke: thanks
 MSmits: have a good day
 struct: 7*7*4 should not take long
 struct: if you pass by reference
 MSmits: yeah, do and undo
 MSmits: dont copy
 Westicles: Thanks MSmits.  This runs much faster
 Westicles: int AAAAA[20][20][20][20][20];memset(AAAAA, -1, sizeof(AAAAA));
 MSmits: cool, np
 NOTsteve: is there a way to only get selected for fastest or reverse modes of clash of code?  I like playing clash, but I don't really like the "shortest" puzzles
 MSmits: there's no way, but there are other ways to compete on this website 
 JLukeSkywalker: lol, im the opposite. I prefer the shortest
 LantarSidonis: That would be an appreciated feature for sure
 JockTalk: Guys - can anyone help me to understand how thrust works? 
 JLukeSkywalker: friction or no friction?
 JockTalk: no friction 
 JockTalk: i'm on wood II
 JLukeSkywalker: in what competition
 JockTalk: like how come you can just write 100\n and it goes to 100 
 JockTalk: coders strike back 
 eulerscheZahl: the higher the thrust, the more you accelerate
 JockTalk: and there is no need to declare it first? 
 JockTalk: as in, the program understands it automatically 
 eulerscheZahl: codingame will identify the trust because it's the 3rd number in your output
 JockTalk: ok great 
 JockTalk: and what about when you want to change it when the angle is above 90 degrees
 JockTalk: what should i write instead of 100 
 JockTalk: do you need some coding knowledge to do this. i feel like i'm out of my depth
 jacek: some other number than 100. its just physics and probably some formula to use
 jacek: im 1st in chess :tada:
 jacek: and no one in league to compete with&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: NNs are coming at you
 reCurse: Night of the liviNNg dead
 darkhorse64: They are going to tear you apart
 RegalSSBU: smash bros
 Purplishmoon: hey guys,  sry for interrupt,  I'm C beginner, could you guys help my assignment proj. which solve the two puzzle?
 darkhorse64: which puzzle&#160;?
 Purplishmoon: hidden word and Target Firing, have you try these before?
 darkhorse64: No sorry.
 jacek: what school makes that assigment :o
 Purplishmoon: okay, never mind, thks.
 Purplishmoon: UCTS from Malaysia
 Westicles: I do hidden word first, just a word search puzzle basically.  The other one looks like a giant mess of tldr
 Purplishmoon: it's too difficult for our level now
 Purplishmoon: really appreciate for your help
 eulerscheZahl: i downloaded a book about NNs and started readingnoob questions coming
 eulerscheZahl: I assume you use reinforcement learning, right?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl can you share the book?
 eulerscheZahl: let me see if i find it again
 eulerscheZahl: do you have an output encoding?or a value function?
 RoboStac: yes, I think everyone who's had any real success is reinforcement learning
 eulerscheZahl: ok, no supervised learning then
 MSmits: supervised learning requires you already know what good actions are
 RoboStac: the only one I'm aware of that was different was pen training a csb bot off his existing bot
 RoboStac: but it never got as good as his existing bot
 MSmits: and the bot would be somewhat limited by how good the supervisor is
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/RLbook2018.pdf">http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/RLbook2018.pdf</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Purplishmoon targetfiring has a pretty short recursive solution while hidden word solution is twice as long but is linear
 MSmits: I wonder RoboStac, might it be good to jumpstart a NN with supervised learning and let it evolve on its own afterwards?
 Stilgart: MSmits: why&#160;?
 MSmits: thanks eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: so how do you get your actions? i've seen a value function for a static analysis of the board state
 MSmits: why what Stilgart?
 RoboStac: MSmits - alphago did that originally but found alphazero worked better just starting from nothing
 eulerscheZahl: is that what you do? generate the child nodes and score them?
 Stilgart: the trained bot might be less overfitted and so more efficient
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: Stilgart there are many ways to avoid overfitting with NN's
 RoboStac: eulerscheZahl - that depends on the method used. The Alphazero style I do gives a value (eval of the current position) and a policy that is used as an exploration parameter for the child nodes
 MSmits: you dont need supervised learning for that
 Stilgart: but heuristics CSB bot are probably overfitted
 MSmits: They could be yeah\
 RoboStac: so for every valid move there will be a value to say how likely that is to be a good move to explore
 eulerscheZahl: ok, because the value function seems easier to grasp for me how it's supposed to find a meaningful move on a more complex game
 RoboStac: yeah, the value is the equivalent of a standard eval function 
 eulerscheZahl: as opposed to an action encoded in the output. a complex game has lots of actions but only a few are possible in the current situation
 MSmits: Stilgart if you were to use supervised learning (if that is what we are still talkin about), you would not use a heuristic bot, but rather a good search bot. Maybe one with a lot more time to find a move
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler been playing with your Minesweeper, I like the gameplay version versus Vbobs, but how come it doesn't have boards that require some probability?  or am i wrong.  i don't wanna apply matrices anyways... but it seems kinda submit intensive?  just curious
 Purplishmoon: PatrickMcGinnisll at the beginning, I thought target firing would be more difficult, target firing needs to use linked list &amp; pointer, right?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a success rate &gt; 50% without even using probabilities when i have to guess
 JLukeSkywalker: trying to get my little bro on here, what would be the easiest bot challenge to start with for a non-coder? I was thinking maybe CSB, but idk
 Stilgart: MSmits: the eval function of such a search bot could have a tremendous impact
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well, eval becomes less important when you search deeper
 Stilgart: I don't think the final NN bot will be leagues better that the original search one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Purplishmoon a simple multidim array can suffice with each element representing a ship
 MSmits: in CSB i did not see that much overfitting compared to some other games
 Stilgart: but it may be better
 Stilgart: it's me who is one league below at CSB&#160;:)
 Stilgart: (actually, i am not a big fan of this multi)
 MSmits: yeah, i am not advocating for supervised learning at all, it's obviously not the best way
 MSmits: me neither Stilgart
 Stilgart: I want to apply NN on another multi, but there are not so manu ressources for that&#160;:(
 MSmits: it's better to learn a NN outside of CG, on simple problems
 PatrickMcGinnisII: JLukeSkywalker i think tron or game of drones might be easier/funner to understand maybe
 MSmits: do a NN for TTT
 Stilgart: my linear algebra blob can recognize digits&#160;:)
 MSmits: blob?
 MSmits: did you do mnist?
 Stilgart: basically an extension of my code for the puzzle NN1
 MSmits: ah ok
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i was thinking tron because he has played it manually before
 Stilgart: JLukeSkywalker: for a beginner on CG, I don't think tron is a good idea&#160;:(
 Purplishmoon: Why I haven't thought about  multidim array, Thank you very much PatrickMcGinnisll
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how long has chess been a bot game?
 Stilgart: the inputs are really awful in tron (it was the first contest/multi after all, so the less polished)
 Stilgart: PatrickMcGinnisII: a couple of hours
 Astrobytes: about 2 hours PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, ok, i just saw it
 jacek: MSmits this is what i did first bor bt. learn from classical bot + search
 jacek: and i had good results
 jacek: scroll meh
 Stilgart: BT&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: breakthrough
 Astrobytes: damn you euler
 MSmits: i know jacek, thats where i got it from
 eulerscheZahl: i felt like i had to hurry to beat you :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: and this is what chess people do with NNUE nowadays - gather zillions of positions, let the engine search to depth and adjust NN to those
 Stilgart: jacek: you use NN for breakthrough&#160;?
 MSmits: I think thats because, to train a NN from 0 requires too much calctime
 MSmits: doing supervised limits your bot somewhat, but it does really speed it up
 MSmits: the training that is
 RoboStac: yeah, stockfish uses a NN that is trained on stockfish running at a high depth in order to work well at lower depths
 MSmits: Stilgart jacek uses a NN for most boardgames now
 Stilgart: so, my question is:
 RoboStac: Stilgart - the top 3 in BT are all NN's
 jacek: i use NN for eval only. no policy
 Stilgart: which boardgame is the easiest to try NN&#160;?&#160;:)
 jacek: hmm, oware?
 RoboStac: oware would be my guess
 MSmits: oware has a simple gamestate
 eulerscheZahl: and only 6 outputs
 RoboStac: low number of outputs too which makes things a lot easier
 Stilgart: 175 people in legend, a simple state... and rules I still haven't read 
 jacek: what game
 MSmits: RoboStac, what do you do with score and turnindex in your NN?
 Stilgart: oware
 Stilgart: wood1 = legend
 MSmits: for oware that is
 jacek: oware hasnt legend o.O
 eulerscheZahl: rules are a lie. tells you that you can print 0-11 while it's 0-5
 MSmits: because the best move is independent of the score and is not independent of the turn index
 RoboStac: score gets passed in as is, turnindex is fixed at 0 (learning with it being set led to some odd behaviour)
 RoboStac: yeah, but the NN isn't there to give a good move, it's there to guide you through an mcts tree (where score is very important and  turn index isn't as the tree can take care of that)
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: ho... so this is why I am wood1 while still not understanding the rules&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: I noticed that even with 144 turns left to play and 9 seeds on the board, you get a different endresult for the game compared to when there are 143 or 142 turns left, with perfect play 
 MSmits: the endresult being the net score
 Stilgart: RoboStac: ok, so the meta is a NN-guided MCTS&#160;?
 Stilgart: (no idea of how I can do that for now)
 RoboStac: Stilgart - that's what I do (copied from alphazero). Not sure about others
 MSmits: Stilgart notice that this mcts does not have a random rollout
 MSmits: which makes it horribly deterministic
 RoboStac: though I believe they are similar, using a tree search as well as the NN
 Stilgart: MSmits: :thinking:
 MSmits: I've been meaning to tell you RoboStac, I win 100% vs your p1 oware bot already, add some random :P
 RoboStac: isn't that the one I listened to you on and added random?
 Stilgart: no random rollout is usually a bad idea for MCTS
 MSmits: didnt you recently resubmit?
 MSmits: i think maybe you forgot random
 Astrobytes: when you told him to do random I believe
 MSmits: yeah he did
 MSmits: but i think he resubmitted again after that?
 MSmits: Stilgart you can add random to the move selection
 MSmits: that solves most determinism problems
 reCurse: MSmits likes to torture people with his books
 MSmits: :P
 RoboStac: it's still got the initial random there, but the change I made after for the second submit probably pushes it back to very deterministic
 MSmits: ah ok
 RoboStac: (but made it much stronger)
 MSmits: well it's just half the games, you're still winning the other half
 jacek: how cool would be if we knew the opponent's name ej
 jacek: eh
 MSmits: you could always just retrain it and submit
 MSmits: when i get nr 1
 jacek: so, never
 Stilgart: if opponent == "Recurse" then resign ()&#160;;
 MSmits: If people leave the board alone i suspect i will be nr 1 within a week or so
 MSmits: if they resubmit it is different
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my guessing is horrible, I'm missing some patterns *sigh*  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/522992079">https://www.codingame.com/replay/522992079</a>
 MSmits: I can try submit it now, see what happens. No idea really
 reCurse: Still need to redo that one...
 Stilgart: PatrickMcGinnisII: have faith and do some captchas&#160;:(
 MSmits: i dont think your bot is necessarily weaker than robo's or jaceks reCurse
 reCurse: But it's not necessarily stronger
 reCurse: Which is the issue
 MSmits: it's really hard to say, it has lines of play that i can only draw against
 MSmits: yours does
 MSmits: that suggests it's really strong
 reCurse: shrug
 reCurse: Who gave so much time for othello
 MSmits: Some lines i spent 700k games exploring only to eventually conclude it's unwinnable
 struct: :D
 reCurse: -_-
 MSmits: othello is ridiculously fast to sim with avx too
 reCurse: No need for fast sim when NN eats all the time
 reCurse: :P
 struct: time to open a new league with 50ms and forced openings
 MSmits: the forced openings is a good idea
 MSmits: i just wonder if there's some way to do it without crashing others' bots
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: a new league
 MSmits: mmh
 darkhorse64: dual matches then&#160;?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: what do you mean dual?
 MSmits: swapped?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: also, these starts go pretty deep i hope?
 struct: same board
 Stilgart: forced opening sounds better
 reCurse: I wonder if there's even enough depth to the game to make it better
 MSmits: yeah i wonder that too
 MSmits: but there might be
 reCurse: My NN crushes the top 2 and fails miserably against jacek
 reCurse: That's sad
 MSmits: makes sense
 reCurse: I do have a few dozen other versions to try though, sigh
 RoboStac: the top 2 are entirely book based
 jacek: submit it!
 MSmits: not entirely RoboStac, mine isnt anyway. It's about as strong as trictrac without book
 MSmits: it books to half the game on average
 MSmits: bot takes over after that
 MSmits: vs bad bots it doesnt book at all, goes off book fast
 jacek: books to half the game...
 MSmits: i should say half the game till solve
 MSmits: so ply 20
 MSmits: or so
 MSmits: 20 book, 20 bot, 20 solve
 MSmits: 60 total
 MSmits: roughly
 MSmits: but vs old john it's fully booked
 MSmits: also dbdr and robo
 MSmits: (deterministic bots)
 jacek: reCurse how about dbdr he got strong bot than mine
 RoboStac: dbdr's fallen massively to to book war
 reCurse: I dunno I already switched to testing another version
 reCurse: No point sticking to one that's so weak against one
 jacek: thats some spirit for someone how doesnt do community gamed
 MSmits: he only does because it takes him so little time now with his new framework
 reCurse: ^
 jacek: new framework?
 MSmits: NN pipeline he calls it
 reCurse: I wrote a brand new ML/RL pipeline
 MSmits: my books don't go through pipes, I think I need to make them rounder
 reCurse: Saturates my CPU and GPU
 reCurse: Makes it go real fast
 MSmits: is it just speed then?
 reCurse: No, better everything
 reCurse: But that's the biggest improvement
 MSmits: I see
 N-ONE: hello there , anyone knows how to get well in programming&#160;? ,, i take some time to fully get the problem 
 jacek: practice
 MSmits: solve a bunch of puzzles
 MSmits: the hardest part is solving them in the right order of difficulty
 MSmits: you might run into some stuff that is too hard to solve at first
 MSmits: depending on your other skills
 MSmits: some require math and such
 N-ONE: oh i see ,, the problem is that i sometimes don't understant the question lol
 MSmits: some are hard to understand
 MSmits: btw, if you are doing clashes. That is really not the easiest way to learn
 MSmits: you dont want the stress of a time limit
 N-ONE: i feel so stupid lol 
 N-ONE: i can solve but need more time 
 N-ONE: i am still beginner 
 MSmits: then keep solving
 N-ONE: can i share my github ,, i need some advises about my code 
 MSmits: generally you should not, but for simple puzzles, it is ok
 Stilgart: would be nice to have a code review process directly on CG
 N-ONE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/AYehia0">https://github.com/AYehia0</a>
 reCurse: lol
 Stilgart: did you see a cat&#160;?
 N-ONE: hehe lol 
 N-ONE: cat bois go burrr
 MSmits: did we just get catrolled?
 struct: I only have 1 problem on opening the new league
 Stilgart: this will reset the leaderboard&#160;?
 struct: no
 Stilgart: ho... we can resubmit a commu multi without reseting the leaderboard&#160;???
 struct: I need to make a stronger boss than wood 2 
 struct: Yeah Stilgart
 struct: it wont reset
 struct: When you submit a new boss it would be like a player submit
 MSmits: struct, make an AVX-ed bot with typical othello eval
 eulerscheZahl: just submit a new boss above
 jacek: use mine :v
 eulerscheZahl: last time i tried, the boss started with a negative score despite winning
 Stilgart: don't use mine
 Astrobytes: darkhorse will write one for you :P
 eulerscheZahl: then slowly climbed. but still ranked way above the actual skill level
 struct: I cant choose a player, its not that easy
 eulerscheZahl: why would you even want a new league?
 struct: to force openings
 eulerscheZahl: ah (sorry, didn't read the whole chat)
 reCurse: Might be good to prove if it helps
 eulerscheZahl: ^
 reCurse: Before doing it
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl othello is the most heavily booked game we have i think
 MSmits: thats why
 MSmits: I hope it works
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for the warning, i won't touch it
 reCurse: Yeah it's pretty gross
 MSmits: it might be fun after the forced openings
 eulerscheZahl: then you will just book later turns
 reCurse: And 150ms to deep search a narrow game
 MSmits: thats not how it works really
 MSmits: there are millions upon millions of endgames, not bookable
 eulerscheZahl: then i don't understand what the opening does i suppose
 MSmits: there's not just 1 opening
 RoboStac: there are thousands to choose from
 eulerscheZahl: just a different starting pos?
 eulerscheZahl: like chess 960?
 struct: no
 struct: like TCEC
 struct: where N moves are forced
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what that means
 Stilgart: TCEC&#160;?
 reCurse: top chess engine championship
 struct: euler its 6 move opening
 eulerscheZahl: that explains the acronym but not what it does
 Stilgart: AutomatonNN: you should learn how to translate acronyms
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to build a sim and then convert it to a struct that properts in python 
 struct: 8 move*
 reCurse: "where N moves are forced"
 MSmits: how many different ones struct?
 struct: 3623 
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what a forced move means
 Stilgart: double hl&#160;:/ no i feel bad
 eulerscheZahl: let be know if i should just leave the chat
 struct: with range of +1 -1
 MSmits: are these 3623 unique?
 MSmits: considering symmetry
 struct: you are asking due to symetries?
 MSmits: yes
 RoboStac: you get given a gamestate at the start thats partway through a game so the starting position isn't the same every time
 struct: I think so MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: so it is like chess960 as i implied (different starting position)
 MSmits: then it should be fine
 MSmits: I can't book that
 darkhorse64: othello bot is SSE bot without solver. My bot is AVX based with solver which makes it barely stronger than the boss despite being twice as fast. My eval is really simplistic this is why it stays at the bottom. I lack motivation
 MSmits: well... partly, but not sufficiently
 eulerscheZahl: like chess 960?struct  04:50PMno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: N-ONE an stadium seating in java-&gt;sql  smh, framework might function but real world world crash the hell out of it
 RoboStac: yeah, pretty much. The only difference is chess 960 can be an invalid chess position
 eulerscheZahl: i'm totally confused now
 eulerscheZahl: rage close chat
 eulerscheZahl: bye
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl robo just explained it :P
 reCurse: I think it's the first time I've seen euler ragequit
 MSmits: i think he ragequits often, but just pretends to "go to bed" 
 reCurse: lol
 reCurse: Mystery solved
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 darkhorse64: TCEC is a computer-computer chess championship
 reCurse: Ok this NN isn't working straight up, dunno what jacek did
 reCurse: Wonder if I need a bigger or smaller net
 MSmits: jacek had a regular bot first
 MSmits: might have incorporated some domain knowledge
 darkhorse64: The final is running now. Stockfish NNUE against Leela Chess Zero (a GPU based NN)
 MSmits: jacek
 PatrickMcGinnisII: When eulerscheZahl's cat starts banning people ... then we r in real trouble
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits</a>
 MSmits: time to retrain some NN's&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'll be waiting
 Stilgart: your oware is doing well
 RoboStac: time for oware960
 RoboStac:&#160;:(
 reCurse: Nice book
 MSmits: lol, a simpel retrain and some random should really be sufficient. This is a 200 ply game guys
 reCurse: Calling this a 200 ply game is like calling chess endgame piece shuffling a 150 ply game
 MSmits: hmm seen plenty of games where no seeds get captured in the first 30-40
 MSmits: Moves Added: 2402
 MSmits: thats how many are in the book
 MSmits: it's really not that many, the bot is quite good without them. It was only being beaten by NN's
 reCurse: Burn the books
 darkhorse64: 5 elo points between 5 and 6:cry:
 darkhorse64: +4 rather
 MSmits: yeah those NN's are ridiculously strong
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fml  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/522998605">https://www.codingame.com/replay/522998605</a>
 MSmits: I get nostalgic when i see eulers minesweeper replays&#160;:)
 Stilgart: PatrickMcGinnisII: got this 3-4 times before I was finally able to get 100%
 MSmits: Robo, just resubmitting to beat jacek or did you increase your random a little bit?
 MSmits: RoboStac
 reCurse: Interesting, I had to pick a version from early in the training to beat jacek
 reCurse: I guess I'm overfitting
 MSmits: thats what i meant reCurse, its a really strong bot 
 MSmits: RPS effects
 reCurse: I'm talking about othello
 MSmits: oh ok
 reCurse: I keep having those overfitting issues
 MSmits: well it might be true for any of these simple games. Those NN's play so near perfectly that it's all about 1 or 2 mistakes either player makes
 MSmits: watch some games
 MSmits: you<i>ll see many identical games i bet</i>
 MSmits: that's not overfitting, it's determinism
 struct: true ai
 struct: if else
 reCurse: I'm not sure which of us misunderstands
 reCurse: If it plays very weakly in a line that means it overfits to what it thinks are the only viable lines
 MSmits: well with overfitting, you are mostly talking about some thing that one bot values that is weak or strong against what another bot values in eval
 reCurse: Not a matter of determinism here
 reCurse: If anything I can take the top 3 as an ensemble
 MSmits: dont bother comparing against me and oldjohn at all, it's meaningless
 reCurse: Is it
 MSmits: yeah, i think so
 MSmits: if your bot heads into a well travelled line of play, you cant afford to make a single mistake vs us
 reCurse: My definition of a good generalized bot is one that plays strong in all lines
 MSmits: sure, but it's not realistic probably, to play perfectly everywhere
 reCurse: Doesn't matter if you stick to one or N lines
 reCurse: It's more annoying to test sure
 MSmits: and othello is mostly about 1 mistake in the entire game
 MSmits: at the level NN's play at
 MSmits: maybe 2 mistakes at most
 MSmits: even dbdr, who did not write a NN, but just a really strong ab, makes almost no mistakes
 MSmits: by that I mean it almost always makes the best move coming out of meta mcts
 MSmits: your bot probably does too. Just the fact that it loses vs jacek, means that somewhere in the game you make a mistake right before jacek has a chance to. Another version of your bot may not make that mistake, but that doesnt mean it's stronger overall
 reCurse: If you take an ensemble of opponents to act as a proxy for your generalization
 reCurse: It's as good as it gets on CG
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 MSmits: you risk two players with NN continuously submitting different versions
 reCurse: The fact it used to do well vs him early in the training and poorly later on
 MSmits: which is not that dissimilar to a book war :P
 reCurse: Is a sign of overfitting
 reCurse: It used to understand that line and then forgot
 RoboStac: yeah, I've given up on my current BT training as it's dropped back to around 50% vs jacek and doesn't seem to want to get back up to beating him
 MSmits: is it really supposed to be training lines of play though?
 reCurse: It is extremely different to a book war
 reCurse: Or if you want to be really cheeky
 reCurse: You could say it's an "organic" book war
 reCurse: Or a generalized book
 struct: so it discards that line completely?
 MSmits: i meant merely that you have two players that each have versions that are strong or weak against the other players'versions
 MSmits: so you can keep alternating
 reCurse: The goal is to generalize to the point there is no such exploitability
 MSmits: that would be perfect play though
 reCurse: Not necessarily
 reCurse: Just a version your opponents can't exploit (yet?)
 MSmits: ahh ok, good point
 reCurse: Like I said, it's a proxy to pure generalization
 reCurse: Where perfect play or nash equilibrium would be attained
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: yup that's a different bot RoboStac
 reCurse: It has nothing to do with NNs per se really
 JLukeSkywalker: is there a maximum code size on here?
 reCurse: Any bot has an equivalent to it
 MSmits: 100k chars
 RoboStac: it's the same nn, just a different mcts exploration parameter that beats your book&#160;:)
 JLukeSkywalker: and no ability to like read in a pre-made file or data?
 MSmits: yeah that works too
 RoboStac: unfortunately it seems to hurt a bit too much against others
 MSmits: which is a sign of overfitting also RoboStac
 MSmits: bot shouldnt be that much weaker if you fiddle with the exploration param a bit
 MSmits: but oware is so simple, as i said before, it's all about 1 or 2 mistakes, just like in othello
 MSmits: that's really what causes the problem you guys have with your NN's for simple boardgames. You should try them for the more complex games
 reCurse: I disagree
 MSmits: isnt it different in csb?
 MSmits: personally I have not seen overfitting with my bot, but i guess maybe with strong NN's it different
 MSmits: with oware i got serious overfitting problems before. Remember when i had no book and was able to beat your NN's just by fitting 7 parameters?
 MSmits: those were earlier versions of NN, but already much stronger than anything else on the leaderboard
 MSmits: i would change 1 parameter by very small amount and my winrate vs a certain NN would go from 70% to 20%
 reCurse: That means your architecture is too simple to generalize well
 MSmits: sure, but why would the NN's be so sensitive to that
 reCurse: There are different issues to "overfitting"
 reCurse: The one you mention is too weak architecture imo
 reCurse: Others can be where your training focuses on the lines it thinks are the best
 MSmits: wasnt just yours though, also agad e jace k and robo
 reCurse: And forget how to even play against weaker ones because they are deemed so bad
 reCurse: But that knowledge is lost so it ends up losing vs them
 MSmits: yeah i understand that
 reCurse: "Catastrophic forgetting" is the academic term IIRC
 MSmits: i notice this when trying to counterbook robo
 MSmits: suddenly i will get 100% winrate 
 MSmits: on a weak line of play
 reCurse: Also there is another factor to consider
 MSmits: with a mistake in it that is
 MSmits: then i go deeper (better play) and i lose again
 reCurse: That noisiness you point to is also a symptom of the poor game exploration
 reCurse: Due to fixed opening
 reCurse: Not just overfitting
 MSmits: right, but fixed opening is a form of overfitting i suppose
 reCurse: If humans were playing they wouldn't keep playing the same line they lost against, they'd try something else
 reCurse: If this kept going on and on then you'd find out who has the better generalization
 reCurse: But there is no memory so there is no way for bots to do that
 MSmits: that's true
 MSmits: and why you train offline
 reCurse: Not quite, it's just to train "intuition" for what's good and not
 reCurse: Doesn't solve the fixed line problem
 reCurse: It keeps thinking it's fine and cannot learn from the loss
 reCurse: Or have an indication to try something else
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: you can see this in all forms of RL I guess
 MSmits: I saw it in simple Q-learning even
 reCurse: The fixed line problem is only a problem of comparison though
 MSmits: what do you mean comparison
 reCurse: If program X has a better generalization than program Y
 MSmits: I guess the thing i was trying to get at is mostly that with a simple game there just isn't much generalization to be had because there are very few lines of play a good bot will use
 reCurse: If that is true then it should be even easier to generalize
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: That's why I disagreed earlier
 MSmits: but it's very hard to do it perfectly
 reCurse: Wouldn't be talking about it if it was easy?
 MSmits: a bot that plays perfectly in 60% of common lines of play beats one that plays perfectly in 50% of them
 MSmits: but what if one bot plays perfectly 99% of the time and the other 98%
 reCurse: Depends on your metric
 reCurse: Mine is to be the least weak possible
 reCurse: I'd rather have 60% against everyone than 90% against most and 20% against the other
 MSmits: true
 reCurse: Which is funny because in real life it's all about exploitation instead
 MSmits: my point is that you only make a mistake in 1% of turns, then it's easy to be lucky and not have that 1% appear in the deterministic lines of play your opponents use
 reCurse: Sure
 MSmits: a person with 2% might have more luck than a person with 1% if it is a different 2% that is more rarely visited by his opponents
 MSmits: this, i think is what happens between your NN's
 MSmits: a less well generalized bot may still easily end up nr 1
 MSmits: forced starts may help here
 MSmits: bringing more variation, requiring more generalization
 reCurse: A step in the right direction for sure
 reCurse: Forces broader sampling
 reCurse: And I'd like to think it's as close as we can get as simulating that "try something else" human thing
 MSmits: honestly, i hope struct puts this in, it's hard for me not to use a winning method, but for othello specifically, counterbooking is not a fun exercise for me 
 reCurse: I understand
 MSmits: I like it in yavalath, because it's enjoying to see bot strategies emerge, but othello is kinda boring to watch&#160;:)
 reCurse: Still gonna poke you for it
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: was gonna say: Poke me any time, but jacek is nearby, it has troll-risk
 reCurse: Unless you mind, then I'll poke more :P
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: RoboStac, that value for your exploration parameter is incorrect
 reCurse: Hmm, I think it would be interesting to have a match against 2 bots where they are not forced anything but given their full prior history
 RoboStac: it's just the old one again as I prefer that to random losses lower down
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: Like a meta AI
 reCurse: Choose where to diverge
 MSmits: well i wont be spamming submits robo. Just one, when i am done with meta mcts, might be weeks
 MSmits: so if you have some version that is nr 1 and strong, just submit it and i wont bother you for quite a while
 MSmits: reCurse not sure i understand
 reCurse: So say you have fixed opening
 MSmits: right
 reCurse: You're bot 1, you lost against bot 2
 reCurse: Next game
 reCurse: You have that game information stored.
 reCurse: You won't do that again. What will you try differently
 reCurse: And keep doing that for 100 matches or something
 MSmits: that's similar to the way NN's are trained and what happens inside of a meta mcts isnt it?
 reCurse: Not for CG of course, just a thought experiment
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: It's not for training
 reCurse: It's akin to preparing lines of play
 MSmits: oh you mean a different way to submit?
 MSmits: bots keep a memory
 MSmits: and learn?
 reCurse: Not learn...
 MSmits: well whatever you want to call it
 reCurse: You don't have enough games to do that anyway
 struct: he will try to avoid the mistake
 MSmits: they change tactics at least
 reCurse: It's not about learning
 reCurse: It's about testing your N best lines
 reCurse: Instead of your only one
 MSmits: sure but if you respond to the opponent, it is a kind of learning? Maybe in the broadest sense of the word
 reCurse: No because your parameters wouldn't change
 reCurse: You only have a meta AI that controls where to diverge in the game
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: so you just play a longer game
 reCurse: You don't have enough information to learn from it
 MSmits: consisting of 100 games
 reCurse: Well like I said wouldn't work for CG
 reCurse: But say stockfish vs leela
 reCurse: No fixed openings, they decide the alternatives to try
 MSmits: yeah, but you're right it is interesting
 MSmits: especially if you're into the particular board game and have some knowledge
 reCurse: So maybe it tried e4, didn't work, but it knows d4 is nearly almost as good, so why not try that
 reCurse: (yes I'm a e4 player sue me)
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: i play e4 too
 MSmits: easy to remember
 reCurse: I was partway into learning 1.Nf3 before I stopped playing
 reCurse: anyway
 MSmits: well always using the same opening is a good way to get a higher rating
 MSmits: because you get different opponents anyway
 reCurse: Sure
 MSmits: it's like using a deep opening book in your head 
 MSmits: I wonder if this could get you flagged for using an engine
 MSmits: if you memorize best openings from engines, up to ply 15 or so
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: There are much better tells
 reCurse: Unfortunately I'm pretty sure all this cheat detection can be defeated
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: for the average player it is np though
 reCurse: Not even
 MSmits: I didnt notice anything below 1400 rating
 reCurse: They just didn't get to that point yet
 MSmits: right
 reCurse: But you can very easily cheat and look human
 MSmits: yeah, no doubt
 MSmits: it's even more tempting if you're a botter
 MSmits: you keep thinking, i could write a bot and play better
 reCurse: I may have done an experiment to prove it :P
 MSmits: sure
 struct: I wonder if when they ban for cheating
 MSmits: I havent done that, because it would bum me out either way, no matter if it worked or didnt work
 struct: if you register again, you get in a pool with previous cheaters
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reCurse ran across something recently, and i applied it to a history with the intention of determining where i should have jigged instead of jagged because the distribution of jigging and jagging weren't uniform, so you can skew randomness kinda binarily, either best or worse... was using this for bulls and cows 2 without having to test each remaing poss combination:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://oroboro.com/non-uniform-random-numbers/">http://oroboro.com/non-uniform-random-numbers/</a>
 MSmits: jigging and jagging
 MSmits: interesting
 reCurse: I initially did it for a training tool
 reCurse: Then realized it can be used to pass the chess turing test
 reCurse: Kinda scary
 reCurse: Not sure where you're getting at PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, umm you mentioned generating things locally (not on cg), and with exponential possibilities you can identify plies in your history tree that may need further exploring or (gene mutation) by using non-uniform randomness of the leafs to explore
 reCurse: Oh, sure, already doing that :p
 reCurse: Well, not that exactly
 reCurse: But non-uniform noise for exploration
 reCurse: Thanks for the link though
 JBM: what's the “chess turing test”?
 reCurse: Play like a human
 JBM: a good one?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: pretty sure i can make a chess bot that plays like a bad human :P
 reCurse: It's not really about good or bad
 reCurse: But just play a chess game and tell if the opponent is bot or human
 reCurse: It's not clear if it's easier or harder to do for a weak skill level
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there plenty of really good short code JS chess bots, i might insert one just to be a pain in the butt
 MSmits: is it about timing the moves? Taking more time for hard situations and less time for easy ones? 
 reCurse: If you speak about the chess multi that would be defeating the whole purpose PatrickMcGinnisII
 reCurse: MSmits: everything ideally
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i looked at leaderboard when there wweree 4 bots, it looked pretty dismal
 reCurse: It just got published
 MSmits: i sometimes analyzed my chess matches and sometimes i didnt make single "bad move" and sometimes it had 3 blunders
 reCurse: Hoping for potw at some point
 reCurse: Because typical chess engines are terrible for analyzing human play
 reCurse: Except if you're GM, **maybe**
 reCurse: I made something much better as an experiment
 reCurse: But it can be used for cheating so won't release it ever
 MSmits: reCurse your game might be slow to pick up because it is not easy to write a bot for it. I will do it eventually though and I'm sure others will as well
 jrke: MS i founded a bug in your endgame solver
 jrke: lemme share
 reCurse: I'm sure potw will help
 MSmits: show me jrke
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/523014537">https://www.codingame.com/replay/523014537</a>
 MSmits: lemme try
 MSmits: whats the bug
 jrke: its printing 20 max for me and i get 21
 jrke: turn 73 your score gets changed
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: that's weird
 jrke: gtg bye
 MSmits: bye, thanks for the share
 MSmits: I'll  put this one on my list to fix... somehow
 jrke: no problem
 jrke: gn
 MSmits: gn
 reCurse: Ahh I think I found the source of noisiness thanks to othello
 MSmits: you mean a general source of noise in your frame work?
 reCurse: In MCTS
 reCurse: I'm starting to really hate this algorithm
 MSmits: I like it :P
 MSmits: with all its flaws
 reCurse: I'm itching to go completely off the beaten path now
 MSmits: sure why not, with this new framework done, you need a new project
 reCurse: I wouldn't call it done at all
 reCurse: It's been PoC'd
 MSmits: piece of crapped?
 reCurse: Proof of Concept
 MSmits: o
 Wontonimo: what's on your alternatives-to-mcts list? (other than minimax)
 MSmits: jacekmax :P
 reCurse: Nothing concrete, only vague ideas
 MSmits: i am actually not kidding
 MSmits: it's viable
 reCurse: Something I'd build on my own and end up reinventing something I wouldn't have known about otherwise probably
 reCurse: Or maybe the next best thing? Hah, right.
 MSmits: reinventing is fine imho. In a parallel universe you would have been the first
 MSmits: people put too much stock on who is first. You're just as smart for figuring something out if you're not the first to do it
 reCurse: Imagination tainting is a very real thing though
 reCurse: That's part of why I don't go into too much details
 MSmits: you mean you think you're first but you already saw a piece somewhere?
 reCurse: Among possibilities yes
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyN7UVfOZB">https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyN7UVfOZB</a> - A Rollout-Based Search Algorithm Unifying MCTS and Alpha-Beta may be a light read to inspire some ideas.  It is an attempt to have the best of minimax and MCTS
 MSmits: makes sense, often it didnt take more than one or two hints from someone here, for me to figure out what they did
 Wontonimo: in games where minimax shines and MCTS struggles
 reCurse: Haven't seen that one I think, thanks.
 reCurse: Adding to the reading list
 reCurse: I still have a weird intuition over something that would be made uniquely possible with NNs though.
 reCurse: We'll see.
 MSmits: isnt the main difference with NN, that the board state is much more accurately evaluated?
 reCurse: Depends entirely how you use it
 reCurse: Can be used to derive a value, a policy, many things...
 MSmits: yeah i know it can be done differently, azero uses the policy
 reCurse: Uses both
 MSmits: jace k just uses the value
 MSmits: yeah thats what i meant
 MSmits: robo uses both i think
 MSmits: but that's not necessarily something specific to NN's
 MSmits: you could have a policy for other search bots
 MSmits: it just wouldnt be very good i suppose
 reCurse: You can have a direct policy without value
 reCurse: That's what Q learning is
 reCurse: Ok, sure, it learns the Q(s,a) value
 reCurse: But it's not the V(s)
 reCurse: So it's more of a policy still
 MSmits: ah yes I did that
 MSmits: seemed to me it mostly just made the table much larger
 reCurse: That's because it's model free
 Wontonimo: another paper (I can't find the source) suggested adding 1 additional step to expansion in MCTS, which is to set the initial win of the expanded leaf to the estimated win rate using a light heuristic (or value function if you will) as 1 sample, then do a rollout for a second sample.  So expansions get 2 samples effectively.
 MSmits: right
 reCurse: You don't need to simulate with Q
 MSmits: thats true
 reCurse: Wontonimo: Yeah that's a classical extension to MCTS
 Wontonimo: i didn't know.  i'm kinda new to MCTS.  any other classics i should know&#160;?
 MSmits: didnt work well for me in uttt
 Lucky_Cloverr: hello
 MSmits: there are many enhancements to mcts
 reCurse: You can read the 2012 survey
 reCurse: It's old but still has a lot of info
 MSmits: most dont work in most games, but they all work in some domains
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/609%20dropbox/other%20readings%20and%20resources/MCTS-survey.pdf">http://www.incompleteideas.net/609%20dropbox/other%20readings%20and%20resources/MCTS-survey.pdf</a>
 MSmits: it's a lot of trial and error
 Wontonimo: outch, that's old.  i'm embarased 
 MSmits: old in this case doesnt mean bad
 MSmits: focus of the field probably shifted since then
 Wontonimo: Thanks reCurse&#160;!
 MSmits: so it could still be up to date
 reCurse: Keep in mind it's all done before NNs took over
 MSmits: (mostly)
 reCurse: Which may be a good or a bad thing depending on what you want to get out of it
 Lucky_Cloverr: I'm kinda lost, I'm trying to do Ascii Art but I don't know what I'm doing wrong
 reCurse: Personally I'm just glad I finally beat the random rollouts in uttt
 reCurse: It was hurting my soul deeply
 MSmits: I still wonder if you really beat karlis o convincingly though?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: I mean, if he doesnt have a slightly different version that you dont beat
 reCurse: rc2          karlis o      241-139-40 (62.14%) 420 games
 MSmits: you know how it is with these things
 MSmits: he beats us by a far far greater margin
 reCurse: Like I said, I prefer 60 over everyone
 MSmits: let me put it this way
 MSmits: i am sure you have multiple versions
 MSmits: do they mostly beat him?
 MSmits: or is it only a few and you picked the strongest
 Lucky_Cloverr: thanks for the help!
 MSmits: because he can do that to you as well
 MSmits: while still beating the rest as well
 reCurse: What's your point?
 MSmits: that it might be true that you share the top
 reCurse: Well right now it's not
 MSmits: thats all
 reCurse: That's all we ever get right? A snapshot
 MSmits: well if your claim is you beat random rollouts it's true regardless
 reCurse: Indeed
 MSmits: because noone at the top does that really, they're all heavy rollouts 
 Wontonimo: in one experiment, I just turned off rollout and only used the value function for expansion.  It did better (in that particular game) than random rollout or policy+random rollout.
 reCurse: Heavy rollouts are still random...
 MSmits: biased random
 reCurse: Not the point
 MSmits: ok... i meant not full random
 reCurse: If your heuristic is play a game randomly, bias or not, it irritates me
 reCurse: Especially if you can't come up with better
 reCurse: It's fundamentally wrong to me
 MSmits: does your bot not have a single random component?
 reCurse: Nope
 reCurse: Except processing power naturally
 MSmits: I would personally try to put at least a little bit random in it, to make it less predictable
 MSmits: so that if it played perfectly, it would choose different perfect lines of play
 MSmits: not always the same
 reCurse: Processing power already does that
 reCurse: If it becomes an issue maybe I'll fix it
 reCurse: For me uttt it was more to make a point
 MSmits: karliso has no book and the total number of lines of play is still very small
 MSmits: i could 100% counter it
 reCurse: Leaderboards are broken enough and the game is too draw heavy to have a stable rank1 I think
 MSmits: rank1 sure
 reCurse: Booking cannot be helped
 MSmits: top 3 has always been pretty stable, which is good enough for me
 Wontonimo: are you still talking uttt or another game?
 MSmits: can be made harder though&#160;:)
 MSmits: uttt and general Wontonimo
 reCurse: I'm more in the 'fix it if it becomes an issue' camp
 reCurse: Ends up wasting a lot less time
 MSmits: sure thats fine too. I am not just talking about booking though
 Lucky_Cloverr: I feel like I'm not good enough at coding to actually complete anything on this site lmao
 MSmits: determinism also causes more situations where you re always playing the same game between strong bots
 MSmits: which is not conducive to testing your bot
 Lucky_Cloverr: can anyone even see what I'm typing
 MSmits: Lucky_Cloverr i hope you dont take that from this chat
 MSmits: we're all pretty experienced, plenty of beginners here
 MSmits: thousands even
 MSmits: but they dont chat much
 MSmits: try to do some easy puzzles
 MSmits: if you dont know any coding at all, it's better to do a beginner course elsewhere indeed
 Lucky_Cloverr: Alright, thank you
 Wontonimo: you talk about qlearning, so you are maybe interested in NN.  here is a line of thinking if you want to double down on ML.  Train an NN policy to predict the outcome of many-second deep MCTS calculations.  Supervised learning 
 reCurse: I'm already into training NNs
 reCurse: You still need a search behind them
 reCurse: Unless you do strict model free policy
 reCurse: Which is why I mentioned Q learning
 Wontonimo: once your NN is better than MCTS (with x rollouts), then make NN#2 that predicts MCTS+NN#1
 MSmits: yeah Wontonimo, I think reCurse is the person farthest along the NN learning track of any active player, but it's good advice for others
 Wontonimo: ah.
 reCurse: That being said I'm just a fool with too much time and compute in his hands
 MSmits: aren't we all
 reCurse: You should rather learn from people that know what they're doing
 Wontonimo: I haven't done NN on CG, but it is my profession.
 MSmits: nice, hope to see some stuff from you here Wontonimo
 reCurse: Wontonimo You're basically describing sort of what AZ does
 Wontonimo: but yeah, now I"m realizing i'm spitting advice without really know what's helpful.  sorry bout that
 reCurse: It's ok, it's well intended and informative
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: I'm not really helping by being vague
 reCurse: But that can't be helped
 MSmits: Wontonimo, you might get a little frustrated writign a NN for CG because of the character limits and lack of library support. Just to warn you about that
 MSmits: on CG, being able to write NN's is more a bug than a feature&#160;:)
 reCurse:&#160;?
 MSmits: i mean, it was not intended by the devs
 reCurse: Oh, sure
 MSmits: might call it an emergent feature instead
 Wontonimo: well, I have to say that 3 months ago before I joined I had zero interest in C++, but you guys have inspired me.  I'm hooked
 reCurse: It doesn't have GPUs and tensorflow and ease of access
 reCurse: It's like the demoscene of AI
 MSmits: mostly what i meant, is that for someone whose profession this is, the lack of support might be appalling&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i was a little sad to see tensorflow wasn't an option, but that doesn't mean you can't export values and graphs from tensorflow externally
 MSmits: but you can view it as a challenge instead
 Astrobytes: "It's like the demoscene of AI" - spot on.
 MSmits: hi Astrobytes, i was nr 1 oware for 5 minutes
 MSmits: but robo changed a parameter
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah, just been reading the chat 
 reCurse: What do you do for a living Wontonimo if it's not inappropriate to ask
 reCurse: Astrobytes: If you want to push the analogy further you could say CG is like Dreamhack&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: I lead a small machine learning team at tax automation at one of the big 3.  Automated tax categorization, ain't glamorous but it pays the bills.  Before that I did NLP and image processing for social media 
 reCurse: Oh that's cool still
 MSmits: neuro linguistic processing?
 Wontonimo: tensorflow , mongo , and if I have to I do Java and Angular (but I avoid it... since joining CG I've stated to not!  thanks CG)
 Astrobytes: haha yes reCurse&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: MSmits: natural language processing
 Wontonimo: no neuro linguistic processing.  Real basic stuff, but it has to train with like 5 training examples because the clients are people and not robots and lose patience lol
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: i missed some q learning stuff?
 Wontonimo: back to q learning, how would you address the training space in uttt&#160;?
 Wontonimo: are you looking at hand crafted features in-lieu of or as a proxy to state
 MSmits: noone uses q learning for uttt i think
 MSmits: not sure how recurse does it exactly, but imagine training a network to evaluate the board state
 MSmits: and then use this in some form of search
 MSmits: most likely mcts-type
 jacek: like a0
 Wontonimo: oh, i thought we were talking about q learning the policy
 MSmits: no, i think i brought it up somewhere because q learning is all i ever did personally, despite reading a lot on NN;s
 Wontonimo: ah
 MSmits: i taught a module about AI to high schoolers
 MSmits: one chapter was NN's
 MSmits: I used the tensorflow playground
 Wontonimo: that is a nice playground
 MSmits: yeah, worked nicely
 MSmits: i like how you can turn parts of it on and off
 MSmits: enabled me to build things up slowly
 jacek: that web thing?
 MSmits: yes
 Wontonimo: uttt screams CNN, but ... but I just don't think it CNN would out perform bitboarding and pre-computing win/loss moves
 MSmits: first time i saw it myself i was a bit overwhelmed, but if you turn things on 1 by 1, it's easy to understand
 MSmits: what do you mean by precomputing?
 jacek: uttt screams "kill me"
 MSmits: lookup tables for miniboards?
 Wontonimo: yes
 MSmits: everyone does that
 MSmits: but thats not enough
 MSmits: reCurse is the only one that succeeded in making a top NN in uttt
 MSmits: i think it's not easy to do, but possible apparently
 MSmits: I will revisit the game at some point and try to beat him again, but too much else to do&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: what i meant is, CNN would can't compete with just raw lookup if you can have an exhaustive lookup, and since everyone does lookup tables for the miniboards, then CNN has no place
 MSmits: exhaustive lookup is impossible
 MSmits: too many states
 MSmits: and all miniboards are connected
 MSmits: you only use lookups to increase performance, not to actually cut short the game
 kovi: and submit character limit
 MSmits: well there is that, though tables can be generated in the first 1s
 MSmits: Wontonimo, uttt state space is around 10^30 i estimate
 MSmits: might be less because many states are unreachable
 MSmits: but certainly over 10^25
 Wontonimo: for a mini board, there are only 2^16 (or less) states, so very doable.  I'm not considering doing the whole board
 jacek: oh im back 1st in oware. phew
 MSmits: Wontonimo in fact there are only 19683 for a miniboard
 MSmits: only 8629 if you consider equivalent states with different positions of X and O and finished states
 MSmits: but 8629 ^9 . ....
 Wontonimo: i have a less efficient bitboard concept obviously.  sigh ... I need to make time to implement that
 MSmits: no no 2^16 is fine
 MSmits: 2 ^18 actually
 MSmits: i was talking about the ternary version, which is slow as hell
 Wontonimo: oh, i did type that wrong 9+9&#160;!= 16
 MSmits: your way is the best way i think, for a fast bot
 MSmits: you're just using some extra padding which makes it seem like there are more states
 MSmits: i run local simulations to generate openingbooks and other experiments
 MSmits: in that situation i try to use the most compact representations
 MSmits: for better hashing and disk space
 Wontonimo: now i just need to implement it.  currently my bot is python, MCTS without rollout, policy only.  I'm still getting the rust off my C++ skills that I haven't used for 25 years.  It's changed a bit, right?
 MSmits: really doesnt matter. My c++ is very limited
 MSmits: but enough to make very strong bots
 MSmits: I doubt i use anything from the last 10 years
 MSmits: maybe whats new for you is intrinsics
 MSmits: but i dont use so much of that in uttt
 MSmits: I suspect most of what has changed in c++ is to make development easier, but correct me on that
 reCurse: Ok, where to start
 reCurse: C++11 may be the best thing that ever happened to C++
 Astrobytes: I thought they were turning C++ into C# these days.... /s
 MSmits: do i use things from c++11 you think reCurse?
 reCurse: How would I know, do I review your code?
 MSmits: mmh you might take a guess 
 jacek: well i use auto mostly
 MSmits: I doubt it personally
 MSmits: I use it very rarely mostly because i took sometime off stack overflow
 reCurse: lambdas are a game change
 reCurse: *r
 Batmanboss: hi guys
 Batmanboss: imnew
 Batmanboss: very new
 MSmits: what are things that you would routinely use in a CG bot that have changed in c++11 reCurse?
 jacek: hi new, we're dads
 Wontonimo: i'm dad also
 jacek: you can do vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; without space betweem &gt; &gt; 
 reCurse: Not sure where to start MSmits
 jacek: i bet there are many small nuases that compiler will fail if you turn off c++11
 reCurse: You can read any summary of C++11 features, chances are I use most of them
 MSmits: hmm ok
 jacek: well MSmits and I never did templates for example.
 MSmits: well I use such basic c++ (I think), that I doubt I use any of it
 MSmits: my point was, if i can do that, Wontonimo should be ok
 Wontonimo: it seems lambdas took the programming world by storm and everyone got into it.   lambdas for everyone!
 reCurse: ^
 kovi: for competitions the best thing is range based for and auto
 MSmits: I use nullptr
 jacek: oh i use lambdas for sorting
 Astrobytes: auto saves typing out those insanely long iterator types etc
 MSmits: I guess there might be 1 or 2 bots where i use a lamda for sorting
 MSmits: oh Astrobytes I've been meaning to ask (you know this). Where can i find that fast sorting for beamsearch?
 MSmits: to just get the best 100 items
 MSmits: or something
 MSmits: it's better than quicksort, i know this exists
 Astrobytes: are you sure I know this?
 MSmits: I think you showed me
 MSmits: but now i am doubting, maybe it was darkhorse
 Astrobytes: probably darkhorse
 reCurse: nth_element
 Wontonimo: are you resorting every time you add an element to the queue?  If so, its one sort, if not its another
 MSmits: that sounds familiar
 MSmits: thanks reCurse
 MSmits: no Wontonimo, the idea is, you have a group of states, say 1000, then they all get 30 children, you then have 30k and want to keep the 1000 best
 MSmits: you dont need to have those 1000 sorted
 Astrobytes: priority heap?
 MSmits: nth element is a sorting method to just get the correct position for the nth element
 Astrobytes: queue I mean
 MSmits: so you would get the 1000th element
 MSmits: and then just take everything with a better score
 reCurse: "All of the elements before this new&#160;nth&#160;element are less than or equal to the elements after the new&#160;nth&#160;element."
 Astrobytes: ah gotcha
 MSmits: thats what i needed
 MSmits: i was going to use this for code of the ring beamsearch
 Astrobytes: you're doing that again? You did that by hand before right
 MSmits: yeah, but that left a sour taste, i can do much better
 Astrobytes: that's fair enough
 MSmits: but before finishing my code, i got captured by search race, so my priority queue is a bit jumbled now
 MSmits: I want to at least adapt my csb to get a working bot for that
 Wontonimo: MSmits ah, i keep mixing best-first search and beam-search ... 
 MSmits: ahh ok, best-first-search is also easily mixes with breadth first search
 MSmits: both bfs :0
 Wontonimo: haha ... sigh.
 reCurse: Bread first search when you're hungry
 MSmits: :grin:
 Wontonimo: thanks dad
 MSmits: dadjokes are the best
 JLukeSkywalker: how do you make a puzzle of the week?
 Astrobytes: bird-first if you're a cat
 MSmits: it gets selected
 MSmits: not made
 reCurse: You don't, you make a puzzle and pray it gets selected
 JLukeSkywalker: ah
 MSmits: put some graphics in there
 MSmits: make it look cool
 MSmits: not sure if that helps, but it sure gets more attention then
 Astrobytes: show it to T, if he likes it he might pick it :P
 reCurse: He pities da foo
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: Here is a game idea pitch:  Some game like checkers or breakthrough on a smaller board.  The twist is that you can crypto-mine to reverse sabotage the opponents move (it undoes their move and they lose trust points).
 Wontonimo: You also crypto-mine to protect your move from sabotage.  You win/lose with normal rules or by reducing your opponent to zero trust points (their pieces don't trust them anymore).  The crypto-mining is cpu intensive, and provides a meaningful tradeoff between attaching/defending trust or spending compute on winning the game.
 reCurse: waaaat
 Wontonimo: not real crypto-mining of course, just computation of bit shifts / modulus
 Wontonimo: it would encourage the coding of very good heuristics to save compute cycles 
 Wontonimo: so they can be spent of crypto attack / defense
 Astrobytes: Ah, I see you've already read the Triggering reCurse 101 :P
 Wontonimo: oh noooos!  
 jacek: not checkers, uttt
 Astrobytes: read it jacek
 reCurse: In any case, simplification would be a good start
 reCurse: There is no point to do the cryptomining part, so you could just say "leftover time is worth something"
 reCurse: Then it becomes obvious it's either useless or an optimization competition
 Wontonimo: i did read some forum talk about some hate regarding trying to make a game not work for MCTS.  I thought the hate was around making a game complicated mostly, not specifically about MCTS.
 kovi: i like this idea
 Wontonimo: oh, i didn't think about just saying the left over time is worth something!  That really addresses an issue i thought i'd have to deal with!
 kovi: depth0 + heuristics can have a revenge
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: this reminds me of when google banned me from their cloudplatform temporarily when i was fitting parameters, stating i was cryptomining on their servers
 reCurse: Uh?
 MSmits: i used the 300 euros free trial :P
 Astrobytes: lol, I remember that
 MSmits: running 5 instances, during locam
 reCurse: Oh it's google, they don't actually check anything. Makes sense.
 MSmits: they reinstated when i explained it
 reCurse: Wow.
 MSmits: 30 min phonecall :P
 reCurse: They have customer service?!?
 MSmits: it was a filipino guy
 reCurse: Not the point
 MSmits: he kept having to talk to experts cuz he didnt understand
 Wontonimo: cost them so many euros to handle that phone call they just game up and reinstated you to cut costs
 MSmits: i mean they outsourced for costs
 kovi: then it was not worth for them
 reCurse: lol
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: lol maybe so
 kovi: unless you share the tshirt with them
 MSmits: i did get a tshirt that time, maybe should have offered :p
 Astrobytes: was that locam or another one? 
 MSmits: locam for sure
 MSmits: thats when i used most of the 300, was completely pointless too
 MSmits: i ended up having the same fixed draw order as most players
 MSmits: at least i gave it a good try
 Astrobytes: I think that Bruno guy did similar
 MSmits: the nr 1 did as well, but he did it locally, with a far more performant simulation
 MSmits: thats how he came up with the draw order
 MSmits: the rest of us used brutaltester or some such
 MSmits: except maybe recurse 
 reCurse: I did my own draft algorithm
 MSmits: yeah, you mentioned you did something a bit different
 Astrobytes: and successfully trolled loads of people with your output :D
 MSmits: it did not have much effect overall, but enough to get you +0.5 to +1 rating
 MSmits: compared to rank 3 and below
 MSmits: I should have hated that game considering it flaws, but i liked it anyway&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Might be different if it came along now
 MSmits: because there are so few contests?
 Astrobytes: No, I mean you might not like it now with your increased knowledge
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: not sure, it was just pretty and i did like writing the sim part
 MSmits: just the draft was stupid
 JKSTUDIOS2020: Sup.
 MSmits: hi
 Wontonimo: about making a bot competition... the docs say you need a couple team members to make a submission.  Is that something people sign up in CG like the approve/reject of CoC submissions, or typically do you have to rally support on your own here at CG&#160;?
 reCurse: lol outdated
 Astrobytes: Heh heh.
 MSmits: Wontonimo the traditional community contests dont happen anymore
 MSmits: we will still have contests, but they are organized by CG
 JLukeSkywalker: i mean, if you made something good enough they would probably take it in
 MSmits: but you can compete in multiplayer arena's. It's just different because you dont have 2k players competing at the same time
 Astrobytes: You can obviously still make a multiplayer contribution, but not a contest . . .
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry wrong words ... i meant just making another bot multiplayer game
 MSmits: completely community controlled Wontonimo
 JLukeSkywalker: those dont require team members ^^^
 Wontonimo: cool.
 MSmits: you create something, others comment on it and approve if it is good
 Astrobytes: Yep
 jacek: eeyup even
 MSmits: we have a huge amount of contributions pending though
 Stilgart: s/if it is good//
 JLukeSkywalker: not a lot of multiplayer though
 jacek: clash are multiplayer :v
 Wontonimo: I've been working through the backlog of contributions and commenting / approving / voting as I can.  
 Stilgart: Wontonimo: have fun
 MSmits: a multiplayer arena is a really big thing though. A puzzle you solve in an hour or less on average, multiplayers can be played for days. We dont really need 200 multiplayer arebas 
 MSmits: arenas
 jacek: i cant see the connect4
 Astrobytes: days you say...
 MSmits: well for normal players
 MSmits: jacek
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a55aba2-700e-4032-9e5c-9823aee76553">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a55aba2-700e-4032-9e5c-9823aee76553</a>
 MSmits: if thats what you were looking for :P
 MSmits: if it's not gonna happen I'll turn it off though, not sure if he'll put it up for approval
 MSmits: thankfully did not spend too much time coding for it. Just a few hours on the game, then a few hours on the meta mcts
 Wontonimo: i hear ya about the loads of bot games already here ... tempers my enthusiasm for sure.  Have redirected most of that into trying to approve/test others contributions 
 MSmits: it might help if they make more categories
 MSmits: so you dont get overwhelmed by the list
 jacek: and few days running the meta mcts
 MSmits: both in contributions and in the compete tab
 Astrobytes: The more the merrier imo - but quality &gt; quantity. Regarding multis.
 MSmits: well that too jacek, but that's just alternative heating
 MSmits: it's winter
 Stilgart: MSmits: you can always turn your connect4 into a hard/expert puzzle
 MSmits: it's not mine
 Stilgart: ho?
 MSmits: did i talk about it so much people think its mine now
 Wontonimo: i joked with my son that we'd replace our water heater with a metal drum lined with gpus ...
 MSmits: oh i said game, i meant bot
 Stilgart: MSmits: I am not reading enough&#160;:)
 MSmits: i made a bot and a meta mcts
 MSmits: for someone elses contribution
 MSmits: Wontonimo good idea
 Stilgart: and spending so much time on someone else contribution is just insanely nice
 MSmits: well i liked the game, I dont really have a moderate setting. Once I start...
 MSmits: luckily ran out of ideas fast
 reCurse: Why not line it up with gold while you're at it, less expensive
 MSmits: isn't there gold in a gpu?
 Kaleab: dimond
 MSmits: i'm not sure
 MSmits: they do use some expensive elements
 Astrobytes: Not as much gold as they used to back in the day iirc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo someone did make a forced air heater with their miner gpus, they only turn them on in winter apparently ... i think it recoops 10% or some such on their elec. bill, never recoops the init. cost tho
 Wontonimo: Stilgart I also spent a long time answering questions on SO for others.  It helped me tremendously in seeing different ways of thinking, different problems I don't usually encounter, and relearning how to talk on the interwebs so as to not bring on the fire of trolls 
 MSmits: troll-fire!
 Stilgart: .o/
 jacek: AutomatonNN hello
 AutomatonNN: bloop
 Wontonimo: my interest in currating the backlog in contribute will die out soon enough, just like it did in SO
 MSmits: AutomatonNN, whats bloop?
 AutomatonNN: where you are the one who is from the beginning?
 MSmits: he's being cryptic again
 Astrobytes: NN is much more amusing in fr tbh
 MSmits: does he talk about euler in fr too?
 Astrobytes: Both of them in fact
 Stilgart: MSmits: nope
 Astrobytes: No, he pings fr users
 Wontonimo: fr(s) -&gt; { s/(\w)/le $1/ }
 Stilgart: but he's trolling 2000 about turtles
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 MSmits: wait, the one NN trolls the other one about turtles?
 MSmits: but it doesnt count as a nn ping right? Otherwise you'd get a loop
 Stilgart: yeap... NN learned to say turtle quite fast
 Stilgart: 2000 still has issues with this word
 MSmits: I see, so it's a teaching thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AutomatonNN loves cats
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the contest?
 Stilgart: now, the issue is that, since NN has only 1 neuron, it can't learn unicorn
 MSmits: you mean 1 neuron in hidden layer?
 jacek: perceptron?
 Stilgart: 1 neuron... that's what he said
 MSmits: why would unicorn be harder
 MSmits: oh right, in French
 Stilgart: it was bob's choice
 Stilgart: we try to make him learn "licorne" in fact
 MSmits: you actively try to teach your NN words?
 Stilgart: sure
 MSmits: this is really a French thing I think, when tourists come to France they always want them to learn French also. Is it like that?
 Stilgart: let's not waste Magus CPU time
 Astrobytes: fr is an... interesting place sometimes, MSmits :D
 Stilgart: it is crazy
 MSmits: apparently
 Stilgart: I have tried for 36 years, still not good at french
 MSmits: I can understand some basic words
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: from high school
 MSmits: was my worst subject
 MSmits: only thing i ever failed any tests for
 Stilgart: the issue is not the vocabulary, but everything else
 MSmits: for me it was all of that
 Stilgart: you are given a rule... it apply to less cases than the list of exceptions
 jacek: omelette du fromage
 Stilgart: applies*
 MSmits: Stilgart, apparently my language is worse than French in that regard
 Stilgart: is that possible&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The grammar goes a bit nuts after a very short period of time
 MSmits: I saw a talk where they measured how old children are before they can speak properly, including all the exceptions
 MSmits: The Netherlands was the worst in europe afaik
 Stilgart: I mean, french really is all about exceptions... I have to check stuff every time I am writing an email
 MSmits: Dutch also
 Stilgart: wow
 Stilgart: how can people from these countries can be so nice compared to french people&#160;?!
 MSmits: mmh, not sure if Dutch people are nice
 MSmits: supposedly they are mostly very honest
 MSmits: which makes them sound blunt/rude
 MSmits: if you ask a dutch person how their day is, they *will* tell you
 MSmits: and they expect you to listen also :P
 Wontonimo: no pretence, i like it. 
 Astrobytes: I like that
 MSmits: well to some extent, not everyone is the same of course, but this is apparently what tourists and other people from the outside notice when they come here
 Wontonimo: if you ask a question, listen.  yeah, i can get behind that.
 MSmits: for me it's just normal, so i did not know this
 Astrobytes: I don't like pointless niceties. If you care, ask how the person is doing.
 Astrobytes: Otherwise, stfu
 Stilgart: MSmits: better than our ridicoulously generic answers in France
 MSmits: thats it exactly
 MSmits: we also have just "hi" 
 MSmits: no need to say "hi how are you" 
 Astrobytes: Wish that applied here.
 Stilgart: hi rCSB
 Astrobytes: hah
 MSmits: you can also ask a different question. like Hi, what are you doing here
 MSmits: then you dont need to hear how much their day sucks
 Astrobytes: I bet MK asks people how their CSB is when he's drunk.
 Astrobytes: irl I mean
 MSmits: checks out
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: might be
 struct: is that a french thing?
 struct: I see multiple french people here doingname: 
 Astrobytes: struct: Possibly, when there's a lot of conversation it's very helpful 
 Uljahn: irc habbit for me
 Astrobytes: ^
 JLukeSkywalker: where can we look up clash problems that are active?
 Wontonimo: ive never seen such a thing
 Wontonimo: you enter the lobby <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>
 Wontonimo: and see who's about to join the next clash
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Astrobytes: you need to remember the title or some details about it though
 JLukeSkywalker: yep, found it
 Wontonimo: WOW!  That's great
 JLukeSkywalker: failed a test case, got 100% on validator
 JLukeSkywalker: just wanted to see what the test actually is
 Perlorodka: add a test case, so that it uncovers that bug of yours and helps to fix it next time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Uljahn /get alifeoutsideofirc.jpg
 IMASHELCHICK: hello

 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 SPDene: Astrobytes can i ask you a question about that? :P :P
 Astrobytes: :P
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII ${constant::foo}</b>
 JLukeSkywalker: when will we get&#160;:= in python on here?
 Astrobytes: whenever they do a language update...
 Astrobytes: So, who knows
 zhoubou: They're using 3.7.4. Didn't know that. Also: Hi
 Astrobytes: hey zhoubou
 zhoubou: Hello&#160;:)
 zhoubou: How are you?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, bit tired but alright I guess. Yourself?
 zhoubou: Hmm. Kind of the same
 zhoubou: I'm taking a break from studying rn
 Astrobytes: Exam coming up?
 zhoubou: Yeah, for work
 zhoubou: My job depends on it
 Astrobytes: Oof. What's the subject?
 zhoubou: There are 7 subjects. Mainly state administration things
 zhoubou: Which are dull
 Astrobytes: Ah regulations. All the really fun stuff.
 zhoubou: ^ Right on
 zhoubou: The good thing is, I don't have a degree, so it's easier to pass.
 Astrobytes: I do pharma regulatory, the EU guidelines are a fantastic read if you want to fall asleep in &lt; 5 minutes.
 zhoubou: Haha
 zhoubou: One subject I have is "Fundamentals of the European Union" if that translates well
 Astrobytes: Oh lucky, lucky you :D
 zhoubou: It's easy, but my brain is just.. blah
 zhoubou: There are a lot of text wall type of questions
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I can imagine. Legislation and such requires those types of questions
 zhoubou: You're right
 zhoubou: But I'm helping myself by developing a program as study aid
 Astrobytes: Ah, good on you
 zhoubou: Thanks. I just can't retain concentration when I'm studying otherwise
 Astrobytes: Studying of that particular kind needs regular breaks, any way you can
 zhoubou: Yeah, I'm doing an hour with 5-15 minute break. Then 30-45 minutes break after 3 "sessions".
 Astrobytes: Sounds about right for studying large volumes of text!
 zhoubou: I found it works for me, so yeah&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I always like to go for a walk or go into the garden or whatever for 5-10 minutes.
 zhoubou: That's probably the best way to do it
 Astrobytes: Anywhere outside the house
 zhoubou: The outside? :scream: :P
 Astrobytes: Yes. It exists. I have seen it with my own eyes :D
 zhoubou: Wow. You must be an adventurer
 Astrobytes: lol
 zhoubou: xD
 zhoubou: Being "mindless" or "mindful" is what matters when you are taking a break from anything. And going outside helps a lot in that.
 kovi: chess seems like an excellent contribution
 Astrobytes: Yep. Totally agree zhoubou
 Astrobytes: Yes kovi, re Curse did a great job on that. I've not started yet but looking forward to it
 zhoubou: Chess?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess</a>
 Astrobytes: It's chess960/Fischer Random
 Astrobytes: To prevent booking :P
 zhoubou: Oh awesome.
 zhoubou: (What does that mean?)
 zhoubou: Lol
 Astrobytes: Opening books etc
 Astrobytes: Like set ways of playing according to positions
 zhoubou: I know what books are. Well, the concept of it anyways
 zhoubou: It's "chess960/Fischer Random" I'm less familiar about
 zhoubou: Should I just google it? (Hint: yes)
 Astrobytes: Oh you mean the random part. Check the description on the link
 zhoubou: Ah I see
 Astrobytes: Created of course by the one and only Bobby Fischer
 zhoubou: Neat
 JLukeSkywalker: is there any way to get teh community contest achievement anymore?
 Astrobytes: Nope.
 Astrobytes: I've reported it on the Discord.
 zhoubou: Also RIP 12 contests achievement?
 Astrobytes: No, will just take a lot longer to get there!
 Uljahn: still doable in 6 years
 zhoubou: RIP
 Astrobytes: :grimace:
 Astrobytes: WHY IS THERE NO GRIMACE
 zhoubou: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: I failed.
 MSmits: :grimacing:
 zhoubou: Lol
 zhoubou: Though it shouldn't be named "Happy Birthday!" then
 JAM3S: Hello?

 Minato_N: hi
 Angecide: bruh, I made a sick implementation of endgame solver into my mcts algo and went down all the way to 145th place
 Angecide: I was like wtf is going on
 Angecide: how is that possible
 Angecide: is there a bug in my code or some dumb shit
 Angecide: turns out I forgot to turn on pragma optimize
 Angecide: like wtf
 Angecide: cause it was off because of some dumb debugging i was doing
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: happens
 Astrobytes: Where you at now?
 Angecide: I am just submitting now, so I will see in a few mins
 Astrobytes: good luck&#160;:)
 MSmits: i am trying to adapt my csb bot for search race.  I am really seeing some weird and bad :poop:  in this bot
 MSmits: I can tell this is one of my earliest bots
 MSmits: for example, i have a random rollout in which i generate a random number for a random angle and thrust
 jacek: that means you improved over time
 MSmits: i use the *same* random number for this
 MSmits: so the thrust and angle is coupled somehow
 MSmits: apparently i have jacek, this csb bot is still 6th or 7th though
 MSmits: maybe i should revisit it
 kovi: sound pretty simple to resubmit and test
 MSmits: nah, if i want to clean up this bot, i need to overhaul it, so much is just wrong
 MSmits: and I need to AVX it too
 MSmits: i wonder if this will affect my rank at all if i do this
 MSmits: to get a higher rank i need to defeat some NN =/
 kovi: i c. but still the limitation of thrust+angle together sounds like a huge bug
 MSmits: yeah, but its the random rollout. I remember just turning the random rollout off didnt do that much. The tree itself is correct
 MSmits: might still cause problems with convergence i guess
 MSmits: also full random seems dumb. I could be a bit more picky with my moves
 MSmits: plenty to experiment with i guess
 MSmits: two years of experience botting does give you a whole different outlook  on older stuff
 struct: I dont think avx is enough to beat NNs on CSB 
 MSmits: no, just that isn't
 MSmits: but there's a lot more to mess with and the bot is already pretty good. So maybe i can beat 1 or 2 of them
 MSmits: they're not all re curse
 Astrobytes: inb4 Smits books CSB
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: btw, what are your scores for testcase 20 on samegame? (everyone here)
 struct: One problem is that you wont benefit that much from AVX if you use smitsimax
 MSmits: let me check Astrobytes
 pb4: Even if AVX beats NN, will AVX beat "NN+AVX"&#160;? :D
 MSmits: why not struct?
 struct: Well you are not gonna select the same node 8 times right?
 struct: you are going to backpropagate the values 8x as often
 struct: Same for selection phase
 MSmits: sure
 struct: Unless you only avx the collisions
 MSmits: 20	4885	5265
 MSmits: 4885 is my score
 MSmits: 5265 is highest in found in literature
 Astrobytes: cool thx, just got 4500+ offline, bugfixing atm
 MSmits: not bad
 Astrobytes: it was only a few minutes
 MSmits: struct, I'm not sure how I'll be doing it
 struct: its a fun project anyways
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: pb4, i think most NN's already use it. Also for the NN's the sim is not the bottleneck i suspect. 
 MSmits: For us neurally handicapped coders, simcount is much more important&#160;:)
 AlgoRhythmus: hi all
 struct: why wont NN's benefit that much from sims?
 struct: hi
 MSmits: because usually, afaik, a much larger percentage of their calculation time is spent evaluating 
 MSmits: if you speed up 10% of your calctime, it's not going to do as much as when you speed up 80%
 MSmits: my guess is that 300k sims with AVX approaches 1 million
 MSmits: 30k NN sims, if that is how many they get, will not become 100k
 struct: That seems about right
 YurkovAS: oh no: csb improvements&#160;:)
 MSmits: i'll first try to make search race work
 Astrobytes: Yurkov is always listening :D
 MSmits: yep
 YurkovAS: yes, i'm read chat in pidgin
 MSmits: oh YurkovAS, what algorithm is your live bot?
 YurkovAS: in csb? smitsimax
 MSmits: awesome
 MSmits: so it's now 4 NN, then 2x smitsimax
 YurkovAS: in SR - GA
 Astrobytes: would some kind of SPMCTS work in SR?
 MSmits: thats what i am doing
 Astrobytes: Aha
 Astrobytes: I see
 MSmits: SPMCTS is just smitsimax with 1 pod :P
 Astrobytes: obviously!
 MSmits: it's not gonna be very good, just reasonable
 MSmits: because to be good, you need to allow more angles
 Astrobytes: Initially...
 MSmits: and maybe more thrust
 MSmits: other than 0 and 200
 MSmits: it will be a great initial solution
 MSmits: that i'm sure of
 MSmits: maybe i'll leave it at that, not sure
 Astrobytes: You always come back when the time is right.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I finished my study project btw
 Astrobytes: The design doc one?
 MSmits: I called the game Hex-G, with 6 gravity cards (6 directions of hex board) an explosion and implosion card
 MSmits: yeah
 YurkovAS: i'm run SR at local PC with all validators: this way help me make many experiments
 MSmits: turned out nicely i think, i have to present it on friday
 Astrobytes: Nice! Let me know how it goes
 MSmits: will do
 Astrobytes: Did you turn in your game yet? 
 MSmits: YurkovAS are these validators shared somewhere, or is this a figure it out yourself secret
 MSmits: yeah i did, the demo you mean
 struct: it should be on github
 MSmits: it has the same deadline of friday
 MSmits: struct i think it is not
 Astrobytes: cool
 MSmits: Illeda n included a ton of validators in hopes it wouldnt be leaked
 Astrobytes: Didn't Illedan post them somewhere?
 MSmits: but apparently it has been
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace</a>
 Astrobytes: Or wait, it's on the githubv
 pb4: MSMits&#160;: 3k sims...
 MSmits: pb4 i knew it would be low, not that low though
 MSmits: avx is pointless then :P
 pb4: don't know about the others
 MSmits: it's pretty awesome that you can find the best moves with such a small tree
 MSmits: thanks YurkovAS
 MSmits: pb4, you and re curse, are you in the same ballpark, or did others push you to nearly the same rating
 MSmits: seems Agade pushed you both
 LouieAniez: wazzup people
 MSmits: hi LouieAniez
 pb4: I haven't looked at CSB in a loooooong time, but if I recall correctly reCurse's push he did win a lot against me
 pb4: a huge lot
 MSmits: csb has a tendency to be an all or nothing proposition
 LouieAniez: hi MSmits
 MSmits: so with a small improvement to your bot, you might be equal
 MSmits: it's hard to say
 struct: It seems that the validators for optimizations are hidden
 struct: even for community contributions
 MSmits: which ones?
 MSmits: some have been shared
 struct: Even if I download the zip file
 MSmits: well... they were supposed to be hidden
 struct: it doesnt come with the validators
 MSmits: but they always seem to leak somehow
 Astrobytes: That's why they publish them
 LouieAniez: Let's hack pentagon
 Astrobytes: nowadays
 reCurse: Around 80-90% winrate IIRC
 MSmits: LouieAniez we did that last week, it gets repetitive
 reCurse: vs pb4
 LouieAniez: lol
 MSmits: ahh ok, it's hard to say what that means for the strength of both bots. Because a game is like a 15-20 checkpoint repetitive fight, a small boost in bot strength means nearly a 100% win... at least that is my experience with csb
 MSmits: you only need to block just a bit better
 struct: I could have 4 pods vs 2 and still wouldnt be able to beat them
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: well I could only win 5% vs Pen
 MSmits: and Pen got slaughtered by the NN's
 reCurse: Barely gave me a 0.7pt lead after submitting with over 80% winrate, gives you an idea of the poor state of cg rankings
 LouieAniez: Any nodejs coder here?
 MSmits: just too few games at the top i assume
 MSmits: it may help to do a few submits
 MSmits: because someone who has been on the board a while is boosted
 Kokoz: I just played clash of code and passed all the tests, but whem I submitted it says 0%&#160;?!?!
 struct: Did you hardcode the solution?
 Astrobytes: You broke it!
 MSmits: or he accidentally mistyped or misclicked before submit
 MSmits: maybe was typing in the chat
 MSmits: and typed some in his code
 MSmits: happened to me before
 Astrobytes: Clash heathen
 MSmits: but i do dumb :poop: all the time so who knows
 Kokoz: nope, I clicked play all testcases, everything was green and then clicked submit
 MSmits: weird
 Kokoz: yup
 struct: What was your solution?
 Kokoz: what do you mean?
 struct: your code
 Kokoz: we = "".join(up for up in s if char.isupper())print(we)

 3ataja: what happens at 1:00
 Wontonimo: don't they know coders are usually awake at 1am.  4am is a better time for redeploys

 Wontonimo: anyway, it doesn't really effect me.  it's 7:30 pm here

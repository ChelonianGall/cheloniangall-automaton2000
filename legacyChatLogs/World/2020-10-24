 grateful_tomato: I think there is a problem with the C# backend. I'm playing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/code-of-kutulu">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/code-of-kutulu</a> and I get this error, which looks like it causes the player to die immediately "ERROR: ld.so: object 'libstdbuf.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored."
 eulerscheZahl: known error, ignore it
 eulerscheZahl: your crash on stream seems unrelated to the error you just pasted
 grateful_tomato: ok, but somehow it looks like I die after this error. E.g. I start at 5 6, then the error happens, and next move I'm dead. 
 eulerscheZahl: try to print the whole stdin given to stderr and debug locally
 eulerscheZahl: and hover your cursor over the tooltip in the replay timeline for more information
 grateful_tomato: problem solved, was an infinite loop, thanks again eulerscheZahl. Now I'm first in the wood league&#160;:-)

 TatsuJoestar: how do i check if no input was provided c++?
 TatsuJoestar: "Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0."
 Allis: @TatsuJoestar You can check whether the input stream is at EOF, but probably the problem actually provides 0 as the  first line to indicate that there are no further inputs.

 Raper1798: How to use BOOST in coders strike back&#160;?
 MSmits: "BOOST"
 MSmits: it says in the description
 Raper1798: invalid input. Expected 'x y power' but found '12027 5490 BOOST
 MSmits: lemme check how i do it
 Raper1798: its expecting power
 MSmits: you know you can use boost only once right?
 Raper1798: yes
 MSmits: does this error come on the first use?
 Raper1798: yes
 MSmits: can you give me the line of code you use to output this?
 MSmits: btw for anyone reading this. We went to PM. It was another of those: promotion -&gt; input change thingies. They really should do something about it. Many new players run up against this
 MSmits: nvm... was a different issue
 MSmits: btw jacek. I'm testing the random move thingy on CG bench. Did a baseline yesterday and will be increasing randomness to the point where it starts to affect my bot too much. So I can find a sweet spot to properly fit params
 MSmits: base:

 MSmits: bruh backatcha
 zTTK: i will jutsu u&#160;:&lt;&lt;&lt;
 MSmits: scary
 YurkovAS: MSmits do you have some bonus\penalty in bandas? Stuck and can't understand how to improve: continue search bonus\penalty or increase performance (bitboards play same as byteboard).
 MSmits: it's actually completely vanilla mcts
 MSmits: no eval, just loss/draw/win
 MSmits: however, I do have an endgame DB and high performance
 MSmits: basically, any board that is 12 squares or smaller, is looked up for L/D/W
 MSmits: so 3x4, 6x2 at most
 i_iMatt: hey
 MSmits: the endgame db got me from rank 7 to rank 2
 YurkovAS: MSmits about performance: how many rollouts \ sims in first or second move?
 MSmits: Let me go check, sec
 MSmits: Rollouts: 55808  in second turn
 MSmits: turn 1 is bad comparison, because i lose some time calculating endgame db
 MSmits: one rollout is 4 sims btw
 YurkovAS: MSmits thanks!
 MSmits: oh just to be clear. I calculate the end gam db in game, not offline
 MSmits: so it's not some massive string or anything
 MSmits: takes me 66 ms in 1st turn
 MSmits: you might think I could generate a bigger one, but after 12 squares, comes 14 squares and that's 10x bigger and not particularly interesting (7x2)
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: i just noticed i do calculate it offline it seems
 MSmits: i am confused with oware
 MSmits: then it's the string limitation that stops me from doing 14 squares
 MSmits: lol... I was looking at my code and thinking: "why is there Chinese in there"
 YurkovAS: :smile:
 MSmits: it's interesting, in some games you get a bigger db by doing it in the 1st second and in some games it's better done offline
 MSmits: cpu vs storage size I suppose
 YurkovAS: for strings we may use one big chars pool. each string store in this pool in c-style (with null ending). and in db use char* (unordered_map&lt;char*, uint8_t&gt;).i'm used this approach in some contest. new string allocation is very fast
 MSmits: the problem is the codesize
 MSmits: in oware i store around 10 million seed counts
 MSmits: there's no way you can store this in 100k characters
 MSmits: in Bandas I store L/W/D results that use less than 2 bit each, so i can store more. 
 MSmits: to be exact, I store 10 L/W/D results in 1 character
 MSmits: only use 20-30k characters total, for my 12 square DB. If I were to try 14 squares, it would take around 200k characters
 MSmits: gtg visitors today

 Presac: It is because I have reached that point I'm asking. Just don't see anywhere to actually do it.
 eulerscheZahl: namely "Enable community contributions notifications"but all are better set OFF
 eulerscheZahl: Presac try a contribution that doesn't have a WIP in the title

 Presac: ah, apparently I have only been looking at ones that was wip
 eulerscheZahl: the purpose is that you see some puzzles and know how a good contribution should look like
 PkZ: Does anyone possibly know how to deal with a gradient exercise where you have multiple points and you have to rearrange them?
 eulerscheZahl: WIP = work in progressauthor wants to get some feedback but not ready yet
 PkZ: Or if a name for something similar even exists
 Presac: Does red text in chat mean a whisper or something?

 yusuf007: I'm new in development
 yusuf007: can you guys help me with logic
 yusuf007: I want to build my logic
 icecream17: uh.. you mean the idea of logic or some "thing"?
 yusuf007: Hmmm... How can I explain it
 icecream17: do you mean you want to improve your logic
 yusuf007: yes
 yusuf007: right
 yusuf007: skils
 icecream17: ive never reasearch that before wait a second
 yusuf007: okay waiting....
 yusuf007: btw thanks 
 Presac: A good start is searching about 'and' and 'or'
 Harrogin: Logic puzzles are a fun way to learn
 icecream17: great answers here yusuf007
 icecream17: i guess just do stuff that requires logic
 yusuf007: wow thats right 
 yusuf007: Thanks bro @iceream17
 icecream17: i think presac and harrogin put the better answers
 yusuf007: Ohh sorry Just read those messages
 yusuf007: Thanks harrogin and presac
 yusuf007: harrogin I think your right let me try one of the puzzle game
 Matrix007: what does this mean and why does this happen?An error occurred (#705): "You are not allowed to access to this solution".
 icecream17: logic puzzles are actually a game but there's other ones too, like sudoku and nongrams. coding somewhat...
 icecream17: matrix what did you do beforehand
 icecream17: usually you can access solutions to a puzzle when you have solved the puzzle already
 Matrix007: no it was not mine 
 Matrix007: it was on coc

 midoo: Hello there
 Skynse: Just solved one problem except, everyone got either 80% or 60%
 Skynse: probably a problem with one of the test cases
 AntiSquid: clash? reverse? everyone got it wrong then imo
 Skynse: it was a clash, but a non reverse one
 GreatPanda03: tfw you know what to do in a reverse clash 
 Skynse: lol
 Skynse: Most of the time I can solve those, but sometimes I just bail because I have no idea what to do
 AntiSquid: i doubt it's the puzzle, but you can report it on the forums . 
 Skynse: cool bio quote
 LastRick: Skynse: do you remember the puzzle, if so we can probably look it up
 AntiSquid: ya thankstrying to remember something more catchy from a sci-fi book i've read
 Skynse: I dont remember the name of the puzzle, but it had to do with raising the last digit of a number Nto a power P
 Skynse: N to a power P*
 LastRick: Is this it? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451883b077fe733859abfc66885dff5debc2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451883b077fe733859abfc66885dff5debc2</a>
 Skynse: yeah that was it actually
 Skynse: ok I see why I got 80 now
 LastRick: Glad to help
 Skynse: the process timed out meaning my code was inefficient
 Skynse: lol print(str(n**p)[-1]) is pretty inefficient
 AntiSquid: kinda lame puzzle imo, you need to know some of the power tricks when you're in a rush .
 LastRick: One change I would like to see in the submission page is perhaps clarifying why you missed a problem. Instead of it saying 80% and turning the option red, why not replace the title with TimeOut or incorrect? Would be a lot more informative.
 AntiSquid: agree with visual's comment lol ... where is visual, haven't seen him in a long time#
 Skynse: broooo, I forgot I was in a clash
 AntiSquid: if you get a mini leaderboard with&#160;% at the end it's clash .
 AntiSquid: &lt; 15 min timer&#160;? = clash
 Skynse: dang, this one was easy af
 AntiSquid: ya if you know the trick already it is easy .
 Skynse: This one was about some chocolate bars and the minimum number of times it could be divided
 Skynse: where m*n is the dimension of the bar
 LastRick: Whats the title?
 Skynse: I don't remember lol
 Skynse: Do you guys have calculators by your side when solving puzzles?
 AntiSquid: you can use your OS calculator no?
 Skynse: That's too slow for me
 Skynse: I mean clashofcode puzzles btw
 Skynse: tfw you get 0% in a clash because of a typo
 Skynse: I worked so hard on that dict and and didn't check for errors(which would be a comma instead of a column)
 Majeck: Hellooo
 Skynse: whatsup
 Majeck: If someone could help me with using the Stub Generator that would be cool
 Majeck: (Ideally someone that's used it a lot before)
 Majeck: I need to create a loop that loops N times and reads two ints separated by a space on one line and THEN reads a new string
 Majeck: I'd like it look like this for python: for i in range(N):
 RohanasaurusRex: hey im relatively new to programming. Since a lot of you seem pretty experienced, would you say doing the puzzles or clash of code is more beneficial? Thanks
 Majeck: Oh, no pastebin?
 Burritos33: Rohana, start with some puzzles to get the basics down. You can see results better.
 Majeck: I agree with Burritos33 
 Skynse: I prefer clashofcode, but puzzles are really fun for interactive challenges
 Majeck: Start with some easy puzzles first then move on to medium puzzles or CoC
 LastRick: Rohan: The puzzles are going to give you more time (more than 15 minutes) to work. So you'll get to learn the code at your speed. The downside is you can't see the solution code until you solve it. So feel free to ask for help here if you're stuck.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb17930b-561a-454c-97f8-f639ff2da7cd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb17930b-561a-454c-97f8-f639ff2da7cd</a>
 AntiSquid: works lol
 LastRick: I completely agree with Majeck: Easy, then start mixing in CoC with medium
 Burritos33: But once you get some basics going, try some CoC indeed. Its easy and fun!
 LastRick: Yep, I do CoC as a change of pace break when I'm stuck on a puzzle, they're pretty fun
 Skynse: I like the puzzles way more however since they are visual
 Skynse: gonna solve the escaping the cat one right now to rank up
 Skynse: I came up with a literal showerthought solution
 LastRick: Sounds about right, always when you're doing something else
 RohanasaurusRex: Thanks for the help
 RohanasaurusRex: Ill try some of those puzzles
 Skynse: haha broo wtf, my shower idea actually worked, but the cat and mouse just move in circles lol since the cat is faster
 Majeck: Yeah, the answer is more complicated than just move to the opposite side from the cat
 Majeck: sadly
 Skynse: yup
 RohanasaurusRex: so about how long have you guys been programming for
 Skynse: almost 5 years
 zTTK: 2-3 years
 inoryy: 10 years
 Skynse: dang
 jacek: meow
 Skynse: so random
 jacek: its still Caturday
 RohanasaurusRex: dang nice
 LastRick: Many many years. 
 Majeck: zTTK same, 2-3 years
 jacek: pump those number up
 Majeck: Doing so one day at a time
 jacek: do it faster
 Majeck: Oof, don't have my time machine with me
 Majeck: Maybe Doc Brown can help me
 inoryy: rookie mistake
 RohanasaurusRex: lol
 Majeck: In any case has anyone here worked with the input generator before?
 Majeck: I'm literally on the border of tears because I can't do a simple thing lol
 Majeck: Maybe I'll go mad who knows?
 jacek: stub generator?
 Majeck: Yeah, for puzzles and contributions you use a special sort of pseudocode to generate the input stub
 jacek: its pretty straightforward, isnt it
 Majeck: I just need to read two different lines in the same loop
 Majeck: And I haven't figured out how yet
 Majeck: I need it to generate something like:for i in range(N):
 RohanasaurusRex: does anyone else keep  getting security checks after doing a puzzle or clash or code?
 LastRick: "its pretty straightforward, isnt it" HAH! Literal lol. That thing is the reason I've yet to submit a single puzzle. Every time I look at it, I think, not today, Satan.
 Majeck: Or in C#: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa490a5e-cdee-4b3f-822f-d357a626df17">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa490a5e-cdee-4b3f-822f-d357a626df17</a>
 zapakh: I get security checks on every clash if I play a whole, whole lot.
 Majeck: Hey! Pastebin detected it this time!
 Majeck: Nie
 Majeck: *Nice
 Majeck: It's not even my own puzzle that needs this, I volunteered to help out someone else (boy do I regret it lol)
 Skynse: lol
 CHackerBoy: try the live stream clashes - great fun
 Unkmar: And they do NOTHING for you leaderboard status.
 chinoto: I found it fun to, not everything is about status :P

 RohanasaurusRex: sorry im pretty new to programming can someone please tell me what's wrong with this:if l in ["olzeasgtb"]:whenever i try with just ["o"] or just any singular letter it returns true
 RohanasaurusRex: and i thought the in operator could check for substrings in a string but i may be wrong
 RohanasaurusRex: Thanks
 Majeck: You don't need to make the string a list
 Metanoob: if l in "olzeasgtb":
 Majeck: if I in "olzeasgtb":
 Majeck: Lol
 Metanoob: :p
 Majeck: Yep, that's the problem
 Majeck: Cause if you do ["abc"] then the "in" operator will only check if I == "abc"
 Majeck: An open question to the CG community:
 Majeck: Do you agree, disagree, and why?
 LastRick: I think it depends on why you code. It seems these days Python is dominating numerical problems but if I'm developing mobile apps, probably wouldn't start with python.
 Skynse: To be honest, I use python for most of what I do because it has readily available in-built libraries that make a lot of tasks easy and not in requirement of from-scratch algorithms. However, if I'm looking for speed, I'll throw python away for the task lol

 Majeck: Nice name
 Skynse: A bit sus don't you say
 Majeck: Vote 123456789LL
 Majeck: I saw him vent
 Allis: I saw him doing the murder task.
 Majeck: LOL
 VusalShahbazade: Hi, I am new here. How I can go to the next boss, I have defeated current boss  and got on top of ranking on areana.
 Majeck: Allis is the other imposter no cap
 Majeck: VusalShahbazade what game?
 Skynse: bruh
 VusalShahbazade: coders strike back
 Majeck: I'm rubbish at that game, but almost anyone else here can help you
 Majeck: Consider slowing down before you reach a checkpoint, that's as far as I could get lol
 Skynse: lol, the current puzzle on coc is one involving poker
 Skynse: I haven't played poker before
 Majeck: Nooooo, I love poker, why didn't I click play again&#160;;(
 VusalShahbazade: Before it was kinda automatical, It was just skipping to next boss when you get some results in arena
 Skynse: Im out lol, poker isn't my thing
 VusalShahbazade: Idk is this end of the game?
 VusalShahbazade: I am on boss 4
 Majeck: Up and to the left it should say your league
 Majeck: And your ranking
 Skynse: when you see a community success rate less than 70%, you know you're in for a ride
 Majeck: You need to get to be like in the top 5 of your league AND beat the boss in order to ascend
 VusalShahbazade: bronze league, rank 1/25,319
 Majeck: Praise be to you, I could never get out of bronze
 Majeck: Just wait a little
 Majeck: In 30 minutes you'll receive the update
 Majeck: it's not instantaneous
 VusalShahbazade: K thanks a lot, gotta check tomorrow, gotta sleep now. Bye
 Majeck: Skynse I disagree, a lot of really easy puzzles have community success rates of less than 70%, especially the beginner ones.
 Allis: @Skynse Aww, it was a really simplified version and Python's sorted() is clever enough to make it pretty straightforward.
 Skynse: Im pretty sleep tbh, so I just decided to bail out
 Allis: Fair enough.
 Majeck: Now I feel even worse for skipping the poker clash knowing that Allis programmed it
 Allis: I didn't?
 Majeck: I love your clashes XD
 Skynse: wut
 Majeck: Oh
 Majeck: Lol
 Skynse: imagine playing your own clash
 Majeck: I have, it's awesome
 Skynse: I should solve more classic puzzles
 Skynse: I coc too much lol
 Allis: It's good to strike a balance.
 Skynse: But I'm in a better position thatn 3 years ago
 Skynse: Before, I couldn't solve the simplest of problems on my own
 Majeck: Allis I misunderstood your comment, so I thought you had made the clash, sorry lol
 Allis: Ah, okay; no worries.
 Skynse: So what applications have you guys made?
 Skynse: My current one is a text editor 
 Majeck: Skynse Yeah same thing, I joined around 2018 and I'm appalled and impressed at the same time by how I coded
 Allis: I had considered submitting a Clash puzzle like Project Euler #54, but probably too much for fifteen minutes.
 Skynse: ...
 Majeck: I remember the temperature puzzle took me days to complete way back when and it was super complicated over 60 lines hahaha
 Allis: @Skynse Have you implemented wrapping yet?
 Skynse: The text editor engine handles that for me
 Allis: Well, that's just cheating.
 Skynse: lol
 Majeck: Right now I'm developing an app for a friend (and school)
 Skynse: what can I say, I was still learning c++ and qt5
 Skynse: but it's fun to implement things that have already been implemented
 Majeck: I coded it in Java using Swing (How I regret not learning C# GUI) and so far it can communicate with a database to handle his' students grades
 Skynse: Java feels like lava for me when I use it to be honest
 Majeck: Different courses, different tests, different grading styles, all that sweet stuff
 Skynse: different languages have different feels for me
 Majeck: Skynse I HATE Java
 Skynse: lol, I dumped java 4 years ago
 Majeck: Well only in locker room talk
 Majeck: Cause I love C# and C# is identical to Java lol
 Majeck: It's like liking one twin sister over the other hahahah
 Skynse: C++ feels lightning fast and native, python feels like a rusty cog, java feels like hot coffee (see what I did there)
 Majeck: Nice
 Skynse: I refer to python as a cog because well, bruh, you can't make native builds
 Majeck: Skynse id you don't mind me asking, how old are you?
 Majeck: *if
 Skynse: dm
 Majeck: Sure
 Harrogin: C# is amazing for the string structure
 Harrogin: Scanner in java is pretty annoying imo
 Skynse: yeah
 Majeck: Harrogin could you elaborate further?
 MACKEYTH: Speaking of Scanner, I'm trying out using System.in.read() instead in code golf. Has anyone had any luck with that?
 MACKEYTH: So far, it looks like catching IOException &amp; the extra logic wipe out any character savings
 Skynse: Java makes it really annoying to golf
 MACKEYTH: Eh, at least you get to compete against other Java. Java = suicide in CoC.
 Skynse: most people use python for CoC
 Camto: Python and Ruby are mad good for CoC
 Skynse: ruby is even better
 Skynse: waaaay shorter solutions
 MACKEYTH: Hm, I'll have to try that.
 MACKEYTH: Have to learn ruby first.
 Skynse: I once clashed with a ubisoft programmer
 MACKEYTH: That's pretty cool. How'd you do?
 Skynse: Well it was a normal clashofcode actually
 Skynse: the problem was simpele
 Skynse: simple*
 Skynse: He's pretty active on this site
 Skynse: Im going to solve the easy puzzles, then rank up from there
 Skynse: I love how the puzzles lists the concepts that will be learned from solving them
 Lachrymosa: Yea, I love this site and recommend it to anyone I come across interested in coding
 grateful_tomato: I understand that the bots might be useful to make the clashes look like there are more real people, but in this clash there were 2 bots, and they didn't leave after real player came in (usually they leave when the 5th player joins). Is this a bug? Might be better to disable the bots anyway. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1434219499b94184653d382a4cc85993581fd2a">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1434219499b94184653d382a4cc85993581fd2a</a>
 grateful_tomato: Once I started a clash with 3 other bots and no other real player, and started another clash before ending the bot clash, to get more people, might be a workaround&#160;:-)

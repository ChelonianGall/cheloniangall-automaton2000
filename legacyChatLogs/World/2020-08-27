 DmcPhuc: cặc
 jacek: ohai
 DmcPhuc: hello everyonw
 jrke: oh dbdr just small difference left...
 jrke: hi DmcPhuc
 codeing: hi jrke
 pbpack: hello
 KJrist: it does not make sense 
 SonicFox: 666
 SonicFox: wa a iu ge
 ABM_ABOLFAZL: why I figure the solution in a another way but it doesn't work like the solution given by the community XD
 dbdr: jrke: small difference?
 dbdr: do you use heuristics only or some search?
 jrke: minimax
 DanielSegal: LaidMalik share code please
 jrke: whats your depth for minimax dbdr?
 dbdr: looks like depth 1 most of the time :D well, branching factor changes a lot over time
 jrke: depth 1? then your eval will be too good then me
 dbdr: what depth do you have?
 dbdr: I will need to check deeper, but not a good time now
 jrke: 3
 jrke: i have made out some bugs and then i need a optimal eval
 codeing: what your favorite&#160;?
 jrke: whats the maximum time your bot is using? dbdr
 roshstar1999: can anyone tell me how to get started with contributing in open source
 Uljahn: make a github.com account? read some FAQs? :thinking:
 roshstar1999: laready have github account and have uploaded a few self projects
 roshstar1999: but no experience into open source
 jacek: fork some project, improve it, pull request&#160;:?
 The_Auditor: chose a project you are using or you like, it will help with motivation. Read the projects "how to contribute" information before choosing the project.
 The_Auditor: some projects have too many hoops to jump through.
 The_Auditor: some projects have no contribution process and your pull request will be sitting there for months
 Tom.py: hi
 Tieuholy: Kombanwa minasan

 DauY: hello
 DauY: ok
 Tieuholy: solo ko
 DauY: are you ready
 Pablo_: for what?
 DauY: i from in china
 Tieuholy: I always ready
 DauY: OMG
 Tieuholy: I from Nihon 
 Pablo_: nice
 Tieuholy: new Game DauY
 Diablo59: HW
 DauY: do you speak vietnamese? :v
 Tieuholy: i don't know kaka
 DauY: oh shit
 DauY: invite me
 Tieuholy: watashi wa nihongo wo hanashi masu.
 eulerscheZahl: please use the chat of the respective country, in this case #vn I think
 reCurse: *language
 eulerscheZahl: right
 Tieuholy: If i upset you, I'm sorry eulerscheZahl
 DauY: toome
 DauY: me too
 DauY:  I'm sorry eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: it's fine.just speak English or switch channels&#160;;)
 Tieuholy: ok bro. 
 Hjax: two accounts from vietnam speaking to each other in japanese written with the roman alphabet 
 Hjax: im confused
 Tieuholy: just for jun ok.
 Tieuholy: fun
 AntoCrasher: ไม่
 AntoCrasher: jk
 JohnPotter895: Im VIet Nam
 JohnPotter895: Hello 
 dbdr: ah, jrke noticed :D
 dbdr: changed anything or trying your luck?
 jrke: just opened d&amp;b page and saw the end of your submission
 jrke: luck this time
 jrke: dbdr did you changed something or went heuristic against me?
 dbdr: I realized why I was always seeing depth 1
 dbdr: I had limited to depth 1 for debugging and forgotten to remove that :D
 jrke: oh
 Hjax: classic dbdr, has a code flag to disable losing :P
 dbdr: :innocent:
 jrke: whats your curr depth
 dbdr: depth 3 on second turn
 jrke:&#160;?? means
 jrke: dbdr depth 3 on 2nd turns means??
 dbdr: not sure how else to say it
 dbdr: my depth is 3
 dbdr: measured on the second turn
 Hjax: since you get extra time on turn 1, the depth on that turn is less interesting 
 dbdr: right. I actually don't use that, but that removes the ambiguity
 jrke: so you don't  have fixed for same match its roaming right?
 dbdr: I have timer to 80ms I think
 Hjax: id imagine hes using iterative deepening 
 dbdr: ^
 dbdr: Hjax, weren't you using rust before?
 Hjax: for othello yes 
 Hjax: my D&amp;B bot is about 20 minutes of throwing a heuristic together in python, its nothing serious 
 dbdr: right&#160;:)
 reCurse: And next thing you know you're still debugging it at 4am
 Hjax: i intend to use rust for the fall contest, whenever that happens 
 eulerscheZahl: in fall?
 Hjax: will it though?
 Hjax: i could see it getting pushed back to the winter 
 eulerscheZahl: who knows
 JBM: who knows
 JBM: hey!
 eulerscheZahl: hi Astrobytes
 Hjax:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: as it's usually Astrobytes who writes the same as me, just a second later
 darkhorse64: jrke: are you using minimax too&#160;?
 Hjax: ah
 jrke: yes
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: i was wondering if youd be summoned Astro
 Astrobytes: If it had been this past week, unlikely. 
 Hjax: been busy
 Hjax:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just family/life stuff. Nothing exciting.
 Astrobytes: Have I missed anything exciting?
 eulerscheZahl: dots and boxes multiplayer
 eulerscheZahl: that's it i think
 Astrobytes: Ah it's approved now then
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 wlesavo: hey guys, any tips on cotr search with expert rules? Have nothing on mind except a few heuristic, and i wounder if there is actually a way to do a generic search for some loops
 eulerscheZahl: i optimized some testcases by hand&#160;:(
 wlesavo: well im close to doing the same :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: validator = testcase with A=Z,B=Y,C=X,...
 eulerscheZahl: except for the last, where just the last letter is missing
 wlesavo: going offline i only got like -400 points
 wlesavo: yeah, i know euler, thx
 eulerscheZahl: i also tried offline with more time, didn't help much
 dbdr: shocking!
 Memo12334: in coders strike back, would a bezier curve do with turning
 Memo12334: sry
 Hjax: why sorry?
 Zone_Infinity: hi
 Hjax: hello
 Memo12334: maybe not good question
 DebugMedia: I need help
 DebugMedia: You borrowed N dollars from the bank. The compound interest accrues I&#160;% each month. You will pay the interest in M months. Then how many $s you have to pay to the bank after M months?The result will be always an integer.
 DebugMedia: Input&#160;: 200 50 2Output&#160;: 450
 C0d1ng_Anub: how to make test case visible while contributing a problem?
 AntiSquid: test cases are visible but validators aren't 
 AntiSquid: what are you trying to do C0d1ng_Anub
 C0d1ng_Anub: I just contributed a problem (for reverse mode). Consequently, i want my statement to include more than 1 test case. How do i do that?
 C0d1ng_Anub: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53754b3f350bab888f111a06e57b4c8a9dd5?comment=30564">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53754b3f350bab888f111a06e57b4c8a9dd5?comment=30564</a>
 Allis: @C0d1ng_Anub I could be mistaken, but I think all the tests are automatically displayed if the contribution shows up during reverse mode.
 C0d1ng_Anub: Yes, You are correct and thanks for helping&#160;:)
 Allis: Sure thing.&#160;:)
 Bobbadillio: I just posted in the forums about Rust 1.46, but what does the process for language updates usually look like?
 AlexisMolestos: when Fall challenge starts?
 Bobbadillio: I've wanted for AGES to have while loops in Rust const fn and it just hit stable in Rust 1.46! The upshot for my UTTT bot is that I can do stuff like pre-compute solutions to standard tic tac toe at compile time, and then refer to those solutions as constants in my code!
 Bobbadillio: Right now I'm brute-forcing standard tic-tac-toe every game on turn 1 and then using the small-board optimal solution as one heuristic. I'd LOVE to offload that to compile-time!

 ABM_ABOLFAZL: hey I get stuck in even simple challenges what should I do
 ABM_ABOLFAZL: im learnin java script and wanted to practice some of the skills here
 ABM_ABOLFAZL: but I get stock even in easy puzzles
 Bobbadillio: Have you ever studied algorithms, and implemented what you learned in a language of your choice? You can probably find a good free course on the internet somewhere
 FengchiW: hey whats the print command for debugging?
 Bobbadillio: what language?
 FengchiW: sorry, python
 Bobbadillio: gotcha, I'm actually not sure, although I think there's a way to import sys, and then print to sys.stderr&#160;?
 FengchiW: hmm
 FengchiW: thanks
 Bobbadillio: @FengchiW to be more explicit, import sysprint("hello test", file=sys.stderr)works in my interpreter!
 FengchiW: ty &lt;#!

 BennyWalnuts: i need help damnit

 BennyWalnuts: i shouldn't have swore
 AngryCarrot: to late its saved in the database
 BennyWalnuts: :D
 Proudrooster: Which is the most fun path, AI, Algorithms, or Clash of Code?
 Allis: Yes.
 CyanRook: Allis, can you share your code on that last shortest problem?
 Allis: @CyanRook Shared; nothing too fancy.
 noisy_datum: does this website have a dark theme option?
 Hiachi: yeah
 Hiachi: Its dark for me rn
 noisy_datum: the IDE is indeed dark
 noisy_datum: but i was hoping that the other pages would be dark as well
 noisy_datum: like your home page
 noisy_datum: they airn't
 Allis: @noisy_datum Unfortunately, there's no native dark mode and even the Dark Reader browser extension doesn't work with CG's styling.
 Allis: Chrome's brute-force Dark Mode hidden flag does work, but it's pretty ugly. If you know some CSS, you should totally consider making a custom userstyle to have good dark mode on CG.&#160;:)

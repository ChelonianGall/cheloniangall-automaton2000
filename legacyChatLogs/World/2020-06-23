 Tim_McSim: Hello!&#160;:)
 sHlOk: Hi:smile:
 tanmaycodernovice: how can we reomove the last letter printed while using print('he',end=',') in a loop 
 AggYz: guys is C++ a low level language
 AggYz: or becoming one?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: how do you use google search?
 Automaton2000: don't feel like i should be aware of?
 jacek: meow
 WINWINWIN: Caturday?

 Reksio: @AggYz: You can consider C++ low level language.
 Reksio: comparing to C#/Java,Python, VB, etc.
 Reksio: but it's an industry standard for many things same as other languages
 AggYz: k
 AggYz: ok
 jacek: for some even writing in direct 0 1 isnt low level enough
 Uljahn: yes, compared to directly operating electric currents

 WINWINWIN: Only 2 hours left on this one, to approve?
 darkhorse64: Someone on the chat said yesterday that there are still boss/referee crashes. Although this is a nice game, it cannot be approved
 Astrobytes: too much data being sent to the viewer, amongst other things
 darkhorse64: I'll post it on the forum. The author should fix and resubmit. There is no reason not to approve a Go game.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't know why the approval time limit is so short this time
 darkhorse64: It has been around for quite some time. tric already made a bot
 Astrobytes: I must admit I'd completely forgotten about it until last  night
 jacek: someone pmed but i closed. how to get back the window
 Astrobytes: afaik you can't
 WINWINWIN: the '/msg' thing?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if you remember the user you can do that
 jacek: i dont :U
 Astrobytes: Use your pony magic
 WINWINWIN: He`ll probably message again
 crystal_prince: hey guys
 crystal_prince: anybody here knows how to delete the chat section
 WINWINWIN: You cannot delete it crystal_prince
 Uljahn: you can by editing css
 Uljahn: .chat-wrapper {display: None !important}
 Uljahn: i use Stylus plugin to customize page layouts
 Uljahn: or you can add an adblock filter

 SamyErd: Yes i agree
 MatthieuGorisse: yes sorry
 tanmaycodernovice: is it something wrong with the site? as it not showing those who have submit in a clash
 tanmaycodernovice: or is it only me?
 imbadpython: its slow
 imbadpython: when people submit it says "pending"
 imbadpython: and it takes about a minute to grade
 jacek: not everyone share their code
 tanmaycodernovice: for me it is not even showing pending now since last 2 days
 tanmaycodernovice: jacek i'm not talking about sharing the code 
 tanmaycodernovice: input(6,4)  output(210)
 tanmaycodernovice: any relation
 Astrobytes: Report it on the forum or the discord
 tanmaycodernovice: okk
 Astrobytes: And, again, as I told you yesterday, stop asking people to solve your clashes for you
 jacek: reverse mode? its obvious input(x,y) = ((6969 * x + 1337 * y) * 0) + 210
 WINWINWIN: jack :P
 Astrobytes: :P
 tanmaycodernovice: nvm i've sloved irt 
 WINWINWIN: well done
 tanmaycodernovice: astrobytes i wasn't actually asking for the code i was just asking for the rule lol
 Astrobytes: ...
 WINWINWIN: Yes... that is also not fair
 tanmaycodernovice: okk then... again my bad 
 Astrobytes: You have a problem, you must solve it, then implement the solution in code. It's a two-fold exercise
 tanmaycodernovice: can u guys help me with a problem 
 tanmaycodernovice: not a clash 
 WINWINWIN: Ok
 chiragbansal24: okk
 tanmaycodernovice: when we use print('ge',end=',') in a loop then it also adds the elemnt at the last 
 tanmaycodernovice: how to avoid that 
 imbadpython: nice
 tanmaycodernovice: pyhton
 WINWINWIN: element in the last?
 WINWINWIN: what is the element in the last?
 tanmaycodernovice: suppose the loop runs 3 times then the output will be 
 tanmaycodernovice: he,he,he,
 imbadpython: you don't want the comma at the end
 tanmaycodernovice: yess
 imbadpython: print(','.join(['he']*3))
 WINWINWIN: or for shortest...:
 chiragbansal24: you can do print('ge' + ',')
 Astrobytes: can you please encourage him to look up functions himself, he's just been asking for straight-up answers the past 2 days
 WINWINWIN: print(*['he']*3,sep',')
 imbadpython: ok tanmaycodernovice gtfo 
 imbadpython: :D
 imbadpython: bye
 WINWINWIN: :D
 imbadpython: is it just me or clash of code grading suddenly sped up
 imbadpython: or maybe for that problem the validation cases are the same as test cases?
 imbadpython: cuz it instantly graded
 WINWINWIN: There was some talk on the Discord on server about submission slowness being fixed.
 tanmaycodernovice: imbadpython we're in the same clash lol 
 tanmaycodernovice: please share the code at the end 
 imbadpython: i always do
 imbadpython: also okay thanks @win*3
 imbadpython: there should be some hard clash of code
 imbadpython: like fastest mode but hard implementation/easy puzzle difficulty
 Astrobytes: Unfortunately CG have a policy of "no clash is too easy"
 imbadpython: @RTTArmel are you reading chat
 imbadpython: rip
 Snef: Astrobytes do you use inline keyword in c++&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 jacek: only in pragma
 WINWINWIN: Does it need to be used as a keyword or is the pragma enough?
 jacek: compiler should inline things on his own
 imbadpython: i feel like this 28 byte ruby solution will get rage at but my python is 45
 imbadpython: inline compiler will do it for you
 Snef: so there is no point inlining functio n?
 Astrobytes: if you speciify in pragma it should do it for you
 Astrobytes: Doesn't hurt to use it but don't think it's necessary
 imbadpython: ^ usually compiler is smart enough
 Snef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e1ff17ad-7a8e-4852-8d04-f2b533dbe67d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e1ff17ad-7a8e-4852-8d04-f2b533dbe67d</a>
 Snef: is it better to do copy paste N() and E() or the call will be inlined
 jacek: profile *.*
 imbadpython: you can try it on godbolt.org
 Astrobytes: ^
 imbadpython: look at the source code
 imbadpython: also is A_K a bot does anyone know
 imbadpython: "Given an array of size n, how many non-empty contiguous subsequences have a bitwise XOR equal to 0?"
 imbadpython: this pretty cool
 imbadpython: n&lt;=1e3 btw
 imbadpython: so no triple for loop&#160;:(
 imbadpython: also ye the submission server is fast af now
 imbadpython: but it doesn't show result/pending?
 imbadpython: 31s vs 31s.
 imbadpython: ok
 noubhere: well at least I didn't use python&#160;:)
 imbadpython: fuck
 imbadpython: fuck
 imbadpython: fuck
 imbadpython: wrong channel oops
 honeyst: lul
 noubhere: oh no :D
 AlexandrePenon: hey
 high_head: from where should I start to learn c# faster?
 imbadpython: find some project you already have/know/coded
 imbadpython: translate into c#
 imbadpython: repeat
 imbadpython: google when you don't know
 honeyst: what was your first project&#160;?
 imbadpython: my first project erh idk
 imbadpython: just code some common algorithms
 honeyst: k  :-)
 imbadpython: gl
 imbadpython: that's how i learned c++ at least
 imbadpython: :D
 imbadpython: clash of code telling me to stop grinding clash of code by giving me captchas now
 imbadpython: huh
 imbadpython:&#160;;-;
 AntiSquid: the only redeeming thing about clash of code for those who don't like it :p
 tutubalin: imbadpython i was there!
 imbadpython: lmao
 imbadpython: i mean its good
 imbadpython: grind leaderboard
 imbadpython: is there any code where python is better than ruby
 imbadpython: or can match it (same length)
 imbadpython: like just the print vs puts is disadvantage lmfao
 imbadpython: and input vs gets
 Hjax: good morning 
 imbadpython: good morning
 jacek: ohayou
 Klin228: guys i have a problem with numbers using C. What should I do if numbers are smaller than long double can work with&amp;
 Hjax: smaller?
 Hjax: oh with a float 
 Hjax: i see
 Hjax: there are libraries that can do that for you, but i dont think you have access to any of them here
 Hjax: so i guess youd have to write your own big float class 
 imbadpython: big int class
 imbadpython: or fractions
 imbadpython: if big int just shift float until int and keep track of exponent
 tomatoes: multiply them on some big number
 Hjax: ^ that works
 imbadpython: @Klim228 what you trying to do tho
 imbadpython: if more specific there might be a better way 
 Hjax: why do we need such precise floating point numbers? a long double is pretty accurate 
 Hjax: oh imbadpython beat me to it 
 imbadpython:&#160;?
 imbadpython: beat what
 Hjax: to asking why he needed suck precise floats 
 Hjax: such*
 imbadpython: oh
 imbadpython: i thought you asking me to beat you to it
 Klin228: ive found the problem, it was my faultand now i need function like atof, but with long double in result. Do you kniw any? (_atold doesnt work)
 TheSpiffiest: Poop.  I got 30 characters on Code Golf, but it still says pending results. 
 TheSpiffiest: I think it might time out before it ends
 imbadpython: til never be generous and use pythhon
 imbadpython: use ruby and win :D
 TheSpiffiest: yep&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: I'm trying bash in code clash, because I think I'm a masochist

 imbadpython: when this round ends ill send my codegolf code
 imbadpython: i nneed help with code gol
 imbadpython: f
 imbadpython: im so bad lol
 Hjax: code golf is a weird skill
 Hjax: because its not really applicable to much, and theres so many weird tricks you can do 
 imbadpython: ye
 imbadpython: can someone help me with this

 imbadpython: ok cya
 tanmaycodernovice: for i in range(1,n+1):
 tanmaycodernovice: what type of  print stement is this?
 rak1507: it's just a normal one, but the trick is that it uses list indexing to pick which one to print
 tanmaycodernovice: what should i type on google to get this type of case
 WINWINWIN: Some guy writing code in bash...
 WINWINWIN: try python -c
 WINWINWIN: :P
 Scarfield: rak alraedy answered it tanmaycodernovice, but test it. let n be 35 
 tanmaycodernovice: that code is already in python tho 
 tutubalin: tanmaycodernovice what is ["Foo","Bar","FooBar"][2]?
 tutubalin: correction... what is [i, "Foo","Bar","FooBar"][2]?
 zizo1337: tanmaycodernovice i%5==0 lets say that i is 5 it would return true and true is equal to 1
 tutubalin: tanmaycodernovice second question is what is i%7 == 0
 tutubalin: tanmaycodernovice and the last question is what is True*2?
 Scarfield: thats too true.. badum ts
 reCurse: tfw you casually find a massive bug in matrix multiplication code affecting all NNs you ever worked with
 Astrobytes: Does it still work after fixing it?
 reCurse: Who knows
 Astrobytes: Best of luck
 reCurse: Reading garbage memory is subtle noise
 struct: How much do you think it affects?They still seem to be very strong.
 reCurse: Well it's noise, NNs adapt well to it just perform less well
 reCurse: Making it that much harder to find
 reCurse: I deserve every bit of it for not writing unit test on math stuff
 Scarfield: doesnt it only increase the training time, and not the performance though?
 reCurse: No because every value you pass to it is slightly wrong
 reCurse: Or very wrong if the garbage memory is exceptionally garbage
 struct: Makes sense, at least you found it
 reCurse: Thank god for nans
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: And you will write unit tests next time ofc
 reCurse: Just like everyone starts backuping all the time after losing a hard drive
 reCurse: Natural comes back
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 reCurse: It's very hard to spend spare time on this
 dbdr: I seem to recall it's not the first time you found such bug, reCurse
 reCurse: Case in point
 jacek: he will never learn, unlike his NN
 Astrobytes: Moar training required
 reCurse: Ahh fuck I'm stupid
 reCurse: Nevermind nothing to see
 reCurse: Garbage * 0 = 0
 reCurse: nan * 0 = nan
 Zerp: in gitc is it guaranteed that there is a link between every factory? besides from a factory to itself?=
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I think so Zerp
 dbdr: not a bug reCurse?
 Zerp: btw is it overkill to implement djikstra in gitc`?
 reCurse: I put nan as padding
 reCurse: To spot bugs
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: But what I found was already handled by multiplying by 0
 reCurse: It just breaks for nan obviously
 Astrobytes: Zerp: No, I don't think so
 Zerp: nice, just making sure
 Astrobytes: Could probably use F-W too I think
 Zerp: wait these algs just returns the shortest distance, and not the path itself?
 Astrobytes: Depends how you implement it. You can modify either of them to reconstruct a path
 Zerp: was thinking of storing the first vertex, that's on the shortest path
 Uljahn: F-W should return both first vertices and distances
 Zerp: really? from what i gathered it seems to just return an adjacency matrix where each is shortest distance 
 Zerp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OQeCuLYj-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OQeCuLYj-4</a>

 PatrickMcGinnisII: draw
 jacek: well its possible
 AggYz: kiki
 AggYz: do
 AggYz: uluv  me
 AmirZamfiratos: what is the ranking based on?
 struct: Everything in the compete tab
 eulerscheZahl: or Trueskill. the question is too generic
 AmirZamfiratos: in the clashofcode i taught there is based on time but then i see sometimes it is on number of carachters
 AggYz: yes
 Astrobytes: There are 3 modes: shortest, fastest and revetrse
 Astrobytes: *reverse
 AmirZamfiratos: and the mode is decided random?
 tobk: Hm, is there a way to see if an optimization solution timeouted or did not make it in the allotted number of turns in Search Race?
 Astrobytes: You can choose if it's a private clash I believe AmirZamfiratos
 struct: tobk only if you run it offline
 tobk: (I mean in submission of course)
 Astrobytes: Is it just me or has CG been almost exclusively about clashing for the past week
 tobk: hm, too bad. already increased the buffer time to 10ms (out of 50)
 Astrobytes: *CG chat
 struct: well clashes get many people when there are streams
 struct: Some people enjoy them
 Astrobytes: Wasn't there something about a 35ms limit in SR? OR did that get sorted
 tobk: says 50ms in the doc, but also says 1000ms for first turn, and it always timeouts when I use that, so those might be somewhat off
 dbdr: Astrobytes: well, some Othello as well&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just submitted again in othello, looks like i might go up 7 places, I'm still not doing any depth
 struct: What do you mean dbdr?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct you relishing in being last?
 dbdr: that was responding to "cg chat has been almost all about clash"
 struct: ah ok, I thought there was timeout problem on othello
 struct: Patrick I dont have time to create AI
 struct: Also I enjoy more creating the games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm just happy i successfully used a spaceshipp operator.&#160;;)

 AggYz: guys how to add binary numbers in python

 jacek: so adding digits separately?
 AggYz: yessir
 jacek: split string into digits and add digits separately&#160;:?
 AggYz: like in a looop

 AggYz: but is there a more efficient way?
 jacek: ask python guys

 Astrobytes: uttt?
 Hjax: yep 
 Hjax: rank 1 uttt
 struct: oh nice he is first
 struct: He doesnt have a book right?
 Astrobytes: gg
 Hjax: i would be very surprised if he had no book 
 Astrobytes: He said the other day, I just can't remember&#160;:/
 struct: wtf he even has emojis
 struct: on output
 Astrobytes: Something about a heuristic (not the teccles one)
 Hjax: hm hes printing out rollout statistics from the first move 
 struct: yeah
 Hjax: so maybe no book, thats crazy 
 struct: I think he said he has no book
 struct: Well you can still use the time
 struct: to search
 struct: even with book
 Hjax: true, doesnt gain you a ton though 
 Hjax: guess it depends on how deep your book is 
 tutubalin: i'm pretty sure he's using one of Dostoevsky's books
 tutubalin: they are very deep
 Astrobytes: hahaha :D
 Hjax: :P 
 Hjax: shoutout to google for helping me get that joke 
 jacek: he seems not using solver o.O
 Hjax: what makes you say that 
 Hjax: doesnt he print a check mark when he has a forced win?
 jacek: on the last move&#160;:?
 struct: nah before that
 struct: 5 turns only though
 jacek: still i think hes bugged <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/474199650">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/474199650</a>
 jacek: he lost to a draw
 struct: What turn is a draw?
 struct: oh 49?
 tutubalin: jacek -0.37 on turn 46. That means your chances to win were pretty high there
 jacek: so i would draw if i didnt see it?
 Uljahn: wth those rollout counts in the replay
 Uljahn: that's not normal
 jacek: work smarter not faster
 Astrobytes: Do both = Profit;
 Zerp: :thinking:
 Zerp: it really weirds me out that c sharp uses 2dArr[x,y] instead of 2dArr[x][y]
 Zerp: isnt the latter more common?
 Hjax: yeah because 2dArr is an array, and 2dArr[x] is also an array
 Hjax: which means you can index into 2dArr[x]
 Zerp: oh, haven't thought of it like that
 Zerp: does this look like a correct implementation of floyd warshall? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/ilagogiqen.c#">https://hastebin.com/ilagogiqen.c#</a>
 Zerp: i really  dread debugging it if it doesnt just work first try
 Uljahn: in python it's just one import :smirk:
 Hjax: good old scipy
 Uljahn: saves the time
 Zerp: not fair
 Zerp: give me node.js so i can import a npm module with the solutions to every puzzle
 Uljahn: you can ask for it on the forum :smirk:
 Zerp: codegolf would be so dominated by node.js 
 Astrobytes: Stop moaning and See Sharp Zerp :P
 Zerp: step 1: write solutionstep 2: upload solution as npm modulestep 3: import npm module in one linestep 4: submit 
 Zerp: step 5:&#160;??? step 6: profit
 Scarfield: no profit without under pants
 Zerp: going from c to js was bliss, going from js back to c# t.t
 Astrobytes: Hi Gnomefield
 Scarfield: :wave:
 Zerp: you dont need to add any extra syntax to pass a 2darray to a function in c#, right?
 Astrobytes: Same as a 1D array I believe
 Astrobytes: My C# is limited however
 Zerp: An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property
 Astrobytes: like arr[,]
 Zerp: i think it wants me to add the class infront the method
 Astrobytes: I think
 Zerp: oh
 Zerp: okay def didn't do that 
 Astrobytes: or type[,] arr rather, btu you know what I mean
 Zerp: i think doc says otherwise
 Zerp: int[,] theArray = { { 1, 2 }, { 2, 3 }, { 3, 4 } };Print2DArray(theArray);
 Zerp: man i really dont know
 Zerp: this is my code
 Zerp: int[,] map = findPath(factoryDist, factoryCount);
 Zerp: and this is the error 
 Zerp: An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property 'Player.findPath(int[*,*], int)'csharp(CS0120)
 Astrobytes: I was meaning like methodToPass2dArrTo(int[,] arr)
 Astrobytes: Misunderstood perhaps
 Zerp: oh right you have to declare type
 Zerp: too used to js
 Zerp: frick, my browser closed and i lost all my progress
 Zerp: good thing i shared that warshall implementation on hastebin
 Astrobytes: Zerp, always code in offline IDE
 struct: I've been thinking about the chess
 struct: My problem is that some people might enjoy normal chess too&#160;:/
 Zerp: are you writting an engine?
 struct: no, i would port it to CG
 struct: so others can play
 Zerp: as a chatbot or puzzle?
 struct: multiplayer
 struct: so you write a bot for it
 struct: and fight other players bot
 Zerp: oh man writing an engine sounds really daunting 
 Astrobytes: Yes for sure struct, both would be great in all honesty
 Astrobytes: Good practice plus 960 is something different
 struct: The game might be good for learning too
 struct: lots of resources
 Zerp: i wish there was a introductory ml puzzle. i heard there was one for python with tensor flow once, but it got removed
 Astrobytes: Yeah was the number recognition one, and only for python2
 Zerp: been wanting to learn ml for so long, but struggling to find some newbie friendly resources like stuff here on cg
 Astrobytes: Brush up on your LA, calculus and stats and hit some tutorial sites I guess
 struct: The upside if i ever port is that I dont need to do almost any change to port from normal chess to 960
 struct: just need randomized start
 Zerp: probably for the better than i haven't gotten around to it, because i've wanted to learn ml before i knew what classes and OOP was xd
 Astrobytes: Yeah like we were saying before it's just a simple change
 Zerp: that i haven't*
 Astrobytes: Are your mathematics skills strong?
 Zerp: just finished a LA course at uni
 Zerp: so no need to brush up xD
 Astrobytes: Well you should be good to start digging into the theory then
 Zerp: when you say theory, what are you thinking about?
 Astrobytes: With regards to general machine learning topics
 Zerp: because i'd say i got a decent amount of "surface level" knowledge regarding stuff like monte carlo, GA, general concepts etc.
 Zerp: what i feel i am missing is a resource to guide me through implementation through cg-like puzzles 
 Uljahn: there are ipython notebooks on coursera's Deep Learning, they're almost like playgrounds
 Astrobytes: That's just search algorithms, there's a bit more to it than that!
 Astrobytes: Yep, I've not delved in myself yet but as Uljahn says there're plenty courses out there with hands-on learning
 Astrobytes: Then you can go to Kaggle or something after that to practice, depending what you want to achieve

 Astrobytes: Gotta combine quite a few mathematical approaches for any ML stuff
 Astrobytes: Stuff like that yeah. Give AntiSquid a shout when you see him, he's delving into it at the moment I believe, might give you some pointers
 Astrobytes: (or references :smirk: )
 Zerp: ty, i'll tell him you told me to bother him :wink:
 Astrobytes: Ofc, hit up inoryy also for learning resources and epic knowledge.
 Astrobytes: And everyone else on CG who's into ML ofc. Ask on the discord and you'll get more response if you word your questions carefully
 Astrobytes: Hey Uljahn, do you pronounce "Uljahn" like "Oolyan" or "Uljan"?
 Astrobytes: Or even 'Yoolyan'
 Uljahn: dunno
 Uljahn: that's nick isn't supposed to be pronounced
 Uljahn: Oolyan could be close though
 AnishaK: are there any games for beginners??
 Uljahn: like coders strike back?
 Uljahn: or clashes of code?
 Uljahn: the site is for practice, you'd better learn the basics elsewhere

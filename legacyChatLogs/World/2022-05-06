 Spressed: Hello guys, any reference as to where I could read and understand 2d algorithms more?
 Spressed: Also, can I use numpy for python puzzles?
 AdemDj12: i missed spring challenge&#160;:')
 AdemDj12:&#160;:'(
 5DN1L: Spressed you can use numpy
 5DN1L: not sure what a 2d algorithm is
 Spressed: I meant array
 Spressed: my bad&#160;:/
 5DN1L: that's not an algorithm
 Spressed: I didn't mean to say algorithm
 5DN1L: ok
 5DN1L: just google then
 5DN1L: you should find some resources
 5DN1L: i mean you should be able to find some
 AdemDj12: do this to see all modeles that u can use:print(help("modules"))
 AdemDj12: is there a way to play spring chalenge
 5DN1L: go to ACTIVITIES &gt; COMPETE &gt; BOT PROGRAMMING
 5DN1L: you can find the challenges there
 Spressed: 5DN1L thanks for the tips, I'll try to look around and see if I can do something with numpy

 Wontonimo: ^^ it's called "Spider Attack"
 struct: Seems like someone is doing a speed run
 struct: from wood to legend
 struct: on spider attack
 struct:&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20480 bytes) in the answer code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fml
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm 818 bytes/node
 PatrickMcGinnisII: on avg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I waste storage to save time...at least i didn't timeout
 AdemDj12: thanks Wontonimo
 jacek: time-space complexity tradeoff eh
 struct: If anyone wants to watch legend speed run
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzgqwaLaXE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzgqwaLaXE</a>
 struct: by the legend chokud ai
 wlesavo: oh nice
 jacek: legend in 1 submit or delete?
 struct: dont think so
 DaNinja: hes in gold now
 Westicles: 7 hours of muttering 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :flushed:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: HA! had to compress strings, but was able to make 800,210 nodes and pass all the testcases for Sliding maze puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Now to cleanup the code and see if it passes validators
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Memory Used: 518435672
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 18MB to spare lol
 IvesL: he hasnt stopped for 7 hrs?
 struct: maybe for a few minutes
 Link_jon: sounds like me
 Link_jon: cept better
 Link_jon: Oh btw why does sometimes the puzzle resets and sometimes it saves code?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darnit, now I'm finding a betteer solution than a validator
 5DN1L: The code is saved if you have played it once, Link_jon
 IvesL: is he very famous?
 IvesL: in some other competitions
 wlesavo: he has his own competitive programming organization
 jacek: and he made chokudai search
 NewCoder09: Silver league on Spider Attack 
 NewCoder09: I'm so happy
 Markus235: how i can approve a puzzle or coc challenge? 
 Pandy: On Community, But i think you have to be level 20
 IvesL: i remembered struct said he only spent 4hours to reach legend, isnt it
 struct: not me
 Link_jon: Ahh okay. Test before i leave then. Thx
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 IvesL: damn these guys are good
 IvesL: i wish i had that ability one day
 5DN1L: Markus235, you need to have played more than 50 clashes to approve clash contributions, and you need to be level 20 or above to approve other contributions
 Markus235: i played more as 50 clashes but cant approve a challange contribution
 Ayza: are you sure it's a clash of code?
 Ayza: It should say either classic puzzle or clash of code
 NewCoder09: he has the contributin path but he's not  level 20 
 Markus235: yes im sure its coc. I can only up and downvote it
 5DN1L: which one
 5DN1L: link?
 Markus235: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1404080918c75310f08f3a882edbf206ae56e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1404080918c75310f08f3a882edbf206ae56e</a>
 Ayza: that's a WIP.
 Ayza: You can only downvote/upvote it and give feedback
 Markus235: ah....
 Markus235: thanks
 Ayza: yw
 Markus235: and sorry
 5DN1L: it's all right
 IvesL: how many hours do you guys think he will reach legend
 Ayza: It's fine it wasn't clear
 NewCoder09: who? 
 NewCoder09: IvesL
 lllllllllnasdfjwhjds: thanks:slight_smile:
 IvesL: chokudai

 Ayza: do you necessarily need wind to get to bronze?
 NewCoder09: no 
 NewCoder09: just really to get out of bronze 
 Ayza: I see
 NewCoder09: 5DN1L at most another 2 hours
 IvesL: i remember i only change very slightly from the starter ai to reach bronze
 NewCoder09: Ayza i can help you 
 NewCoder09: with a wood 1 league code 
 5DN1L: er... that question was asked by IvesL not by me, NewCoder09 :joy:
 Ayza: I only need the strategy, I could try code it myself
 IvesL: if you want strategy, just have a peek on the top ones
 IvesL: go to leaderboard
 5DN1L: or read the forum
 Ayza: I'll have a look on both of them, thanks
 5DN1L: but well maybe too advanced for lower leagues :P
 5DN1L: you're supposed to be able to pass lower leagues with simpler codes
 NewCoder09: 5DN1L meant to tag both of yall 
 5DN1L: ah ok&#160;:)
 IvesL: he doesnt seem like to use debug mode
 NewCoder09: Ayza i can help you with the logic on adding wind and give you a little example of what i used if you want 
 Ayza: sure, that'd be cool
 NewCoder09: alright message me your discord 
 NewCoder09: i'll add youu 
 IvesL: i think you guys could just click the name to start private chat
 Ayza: true, that'd be easier
 NewCoder09: yeah  but it's easier to send a code through discord 
 NewCoder09: but it dont really mater 
 IvesL: you can also send a code
 IvesL: here
 IvesL: if its more than 3lines, it changes to pastebin automatically
 Astrobytes: doesn't auto-pastebin in DMs though on here
 IvesL: Astrobytes are you the one only used 4hrs to reach legend
 Astrobytes: No
 IvesL: really cant recall the name
 Astrobytes: I don't know either&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: legend in which game?
 eulerscheZahl: chokudai was quite fast in a previous contest
 IvesL: in spider attack
 Astrobytes: he's livestreaming his wood to legend
 IvesL: in competition
 Astrobytes: right now
 Astrobytes: (chokudai I mean)
 eulerscheZahl: no streams on the streaming page
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzgqwaLaXE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzgqwaLaXE</a>
 Astrobytes: not that I'm watching it
 eulerscheZahl: he wrote more lines than me already
 ElCimici: help
 ElCimici: how can i break line without \n+
 eulerscheZahl: which language?
 Brawler_zx: endl?
 Brawler_zx: this for c++
 ElCimici: if i use a \n it gives me error
 struct: C#
 eulerscheZahl: we need more context
 struct: ah my bad
 struct: lol
 ElCimici: Your program must print N times a given word, on separate lines.
 eulerscheZahl: and your code?
 eulerscheZahl: \n is not the problem
 ElCimici: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/097bcaef-b37b-44fa-8cd6-fea0ce63f36c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/097bcaef-b37b-44fa-8cd6-fea0ce63f36c</a>
 Ayza: I think you should just loop n times and print what you want?
 Ayza: It'll automatically make it in separate lines
 ElCimici: Found: HelloEnd of line (\n)Expected: Nothing
 Ayza: unless you're using c++
 struct: if i&#160;!= n - 1
 ElCimici: ah
 ElCimici: now it works
 abt8601: Looks like one extra EOL at the end
 ElCimici: why
 ElCimici: aaaaa for index starts from 0
 Ayza: yeah, it'll never get to n unless you make the loop end at n+1
 NewCoder09: hey could anybody send me an example of how they used an attack in silver league on spider attack?
 ElCimici: got it thanks
 NewCoder09: so i can try to add it 
 struct: I didnt attack on silver
 Tuo: silver had shield? you can farm near enemy base and shield some monsters going inside
 Tuo: then enemy has to follow -&gt; no wild mana
 Brawler_zx: Are clash of codes slower now?
 Brawler_zx: I used to get in anytime but now its scheduled 
 Brawler_zx: I mean to ask is this a perma change?
 5DN1L: no, those are events
 5DN1L: you can still join usual clashes

 NewCoder08: Hey guys 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well, did Sliding Maze Puzzle 100%.  I guess I'm the only one crazy enough to get it right in PHP
 DaNinja: yup&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ooo, only 11 people total...i feel special...i mean spacial
 PatrickMcGinnisII: A bunch of puzzles can't be done in php in time... proved it can be done! woohoo
 Wontonimo: congrats PatrickMcGinnisII
 user5128152: i love coc
 eulerscheZahl: there is another S... Maze waiting for you
 wlesavo: :grinning:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: which 1?  I couldn't get number sliding to cooperate
 eulerscheZahl: Space Maze of course
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think the search space is even bigger than number sliding
 jacek: galaxy labyrinth
 wlesavo: you will be for sure first one to get it in php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh number shifting is an optim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh yea i can run that one locally
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, my spacemaze code is missing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, maybe later, glhf
 Ayza: great lol, got first ranking in wood 1
 Ayza: all I had to do was change my distance function
 Ayza: was getting distances wrong
 Ayza: so you do not need wind
 SwagyCAOMAO: Can someone teach me Mars Lander
 antiwonto: [auto] hey SwagyCAOMAO looking for some intro tutorials on programming?  This isn't the place probably.  Try codecademy.com , 'The Coding Train' on youtube, or first levels in codewars.com
 SwagyCAOMAO: :tired_face:
 5DN1L: :thumbsup: Ayza
 5DN1L: SwagyCAOMAO read the HINTS on the left of the puzzle statement
 Ayza: how do you get your mana? since it gets the mana for both players, is my mana always the first one in the loop?
 struct: yes
 Ayza: alright thanks
 IvesL: my_mana
 struct: jacek is first on oware o.o
 struct: dbdr your oware bot seems broken.
 jacek: oware? that tutorial game?
 eulerscheZahl: that's onitama
 jacek: i bet its rust compilator problem
 NewCoder09: #dll
 jacek: #so
 5DN1L: t
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey 5DN1L, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 6 tacos
 5DN1L: oops
 eulerscheZahl: what a nice t. is that the sink of a flow problem?
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. jacek now has 40 taco
 Automaton2000: i thought it was my first contest
 Automaton2000: i do this in the rules
 5DN1L: t for taco I guess :thinking:
 QuixAlt: yo tacos?\
 derjack: :taco: jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] derjack has awarded jacek 10 tacos. jacek now has 50 taco. derjack now has 46 taco
 eulerscheZahl: shakedown jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 eulerscheZahl: you are lucky
 jacek: nyoro~n
 eulerscheZahl: what does that mean?
 eulerscheZahl: you write that quite often
 struct: its his NN framework name
 Wontonimo: there is a #taco channel eulerscheZahl
 Wontonimo: where people can fight eachother for tacos
 jacek: its old and obscure meme even for hardcore memers
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care enough to go there wonto
 eulerscheZahl: i'm tired
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry, i thought that's what you were asking about
 eulerscheZahl: and was in the office today. for the first time in about half a year
 Wontonimo: but now i see it is "nyoro~n"
 Wontonimo: and, how is the office&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 eulerscheZahl: we had this strange group gathering to talk about quality
 Wontonimo: vs quantity?
 Wontonimo: I know the difference.  did your departement need a whole meeting to review it?
 eulerscheZahl: s few keywords given. a ball which we should kick around and when you get the ball you pick one of the words and say something about it, how it affects your daily work
 eulerscheZahl: like "strong together" or "avoiding mistakes"
 struct: :sleepy:
 Wontonimo: omg, i hate those meetings
 eulerscheZahl: same
 eulerscheZahl: and it's supposed to be monthly now :scream:
 struct: lol
 jacek: was there sprint poker?
 Wontonimo: it definitely is made by a certain personality type who is clueless that there are other personality types
 Westicles: eventually they will offer to stop if you get a cell phone.  just a weird intervention
 eulerscheZahl: i was hoping that the ball wouldn't reach me. hopes crushed about 3 persons in (group of 20-30)
 Wontonimo: I'm imagine Red from that 70's show receiving the ball
 Wontonimo: *imagining
 eulerscheZahl: told them something about unit tests to avoid regression. then they let me alone
 MichExpatMatt: this is why I feel fortunate to have a job where I can just always WFH
 MichExpatMatt: That ball kicking thing gave me flashbacks of quicken loans
 Scarfield: make a screen show the accumulated cost of the meeting from combined salaries
 eulerscheZahl: they don't care about such
 struct: These meetings are just for looks imo
 eulerscheZahl: pre-pandemic we had someone to test all our electronic devices (regular annual checks)
 struct: but w/e I might be wrong,  they might be useful for some
 MichExpatMatt: When I would be pressed to track every little thing I ever did for some agile board, there were times where I asked "and where's the task to track the time I wasted filling these things out instead of work"
 eulerscheZahl: so in order to save some time on his side (figuring out which plug belongs to with desk and device...):
 eulerscheZahl: we had this meeting with the whole department where they explained to us for 30min how to label things properly
 Scarfield: lol MichExpatMatt
 eulerscheZahl: and they sent a slide how much costs we save because that one external guy doesn't have to do it
 eulerscheZahl: completely ignoring our own time
 struct: do they pay you to label?
 eulerscheZahl: they pay me by the hour, regardless of what i do
 SonByrne: Yeah, it's funny how we have to make stories as small as possible since this increases the time we spend creating a branch, pushing changes up, managing the task, etc.
 struct: But now you have an extra function
 MSmits: Hey all. The oware guy put our game results up here: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://48stones.com/research-games-challenge/">https://48stones.com/research-games-challenge/</a>
 MSmits: even has a near 2 hr video of it :P
 jacek: woah
 MSmits: they asked me for permission to stream it, i thought that was fine
 struct: Nice, so you did end up playing him
 MSmits: yeah, first game we went 35 plies with no mistake
 MSmits: , then made 1 error cuz my meta mcts ended right before going into DB
 MSmits: 2nd game also 1 mistake. Apparently 3rd game I made 2 mistakes
 struct: he has full db right?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: our DBs completely agreed below 37 seeds, so I was happy to learn tgat
 MSmits: that
 MSmits: I mailed him today about our oware. Maybe he'll show up here too
 MSmits: Not sure if he's into bots though, creating a DB is very different from creating a good bot
 jacek: all this meta mcts just to lose against perfect opponent
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: it's sad, I had many lines of play prepared I would have dranw
 MSmits: drawn
 MSmits: I counterbooked a lot of what I thought he might play
 MSmits: but I'll play him again some time when I have some more data&#160;:)
 struct: Are you still increasing the book size?
 MSmits: you mean for CG? It ceased to be about that a long time ago. 
 jacek: "Reflecting traditional African values, players of oware encourage participation by onlookers, making it perhaps the most social two-player abstract. In recreational play, it is normal for spectators to discuss the game in progress and to advise the players."
 struct: no, to play against the 48
 MSmits: oh yes, i am
 jacek: could they advice against db?
 MSmits: hehe no, there was an onlooker, but he did not advise, he just congratulated us both afterwards
 struct: jacek you must try it
 MSmits: it's possible you could play a perfect game
 jacek: NNs are good but not perfect
 MSmits: it doesn't have to be perfect
 MSmits: it only has to play 1 perfect game
 MSmits: your bot plays perfectly sometimes in the &gt; 36 region
 MSmits: not sure how it fares below that
 struct: and with more time available it should play better
 struct: I guess
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: and bigger net :drooling_face:
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: though you might want to just keep it the way it is on CG and increase the time. At least the CG network is tried and true
 MSmits: making it bigger slows it down as well
 MSmits: bigger networks tend to memorize and you want to generalize
 MSmits: He should see your bot as i linked directly to the leaderboard in my e-mail
 struct: is it the same rules?
 jacek: its 1st because it wins with robo often
 MSmits: I think so, not 100% sure about how an infinite loop is handled at the end
 jacek: Automaton2000 how do you handle infinite loop at the end
 Automaton2000: still have to be top 10
 MSmits: the last game actually ended 22.5 - 25.5  because he was 3 points ahead
 MSmits: but he rounded it 22-26
 MSmits: but it was an infinite loop.
 MSmits: so it never actually got to the end
 MSmits: we just agreed it was infinite and i resigned
 MSmits: (my DB agreed to the loss)
 jacek: how do you get 22.5
 MSmits: if you are 17-20 for example and the 11 seeds on the board form an infinite loop
 MSmits: you divide the seeds evenly
 MSmits: that makes it 22.5 - 25.5
 MSmits: but apparently his program rounds that to 22-26, not sure why
 struct: The other engine is written in java o.o
 struct: it seems to use negamax
 jacek: hmm challenge. player 1200-1400 elo: 11-37	8-40	17-31
 MSmits: yeah that was not a good one I think&#160;:)
 MSmits: the one by the Spanish player must have been good
 struct: Im talking about the spanish ai yeah
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/joansalasoler/auale">https://github.com/joansalasoler/auale</a>
 jacek: gtk isnt java
 MSmits: he has an opening book + 12 seed DB
 MSmits: so not just negamax
 MSmits: 12 seed DB is ridiculously small btw
 MSmits: I can do 20 seed in less than an hour
 MSmits: but his skills lie obviously in the negamax part. That seems pretty sophisticated
 struct: "Strong engine player written in Java."
 jacek: yet theres much python in there
 MSmits: probably the viewer part
 eulerscheZahl: that makes it 22.5 - 25.5but apparently his program rounds that to 22-26, not sure why
 eulerscheZahl: banker's rounding
 eulerscheZahl: round to even
 struct: cant the python be for gui?
 jacek: thats odd
 MSmits: ohh ok, is it called that
 MSmits: he claims to have the best oware AI out there
 MSmits: we could beat that easily if we were going to share it
 MSmits: one of your AI's with my DB&#160;:)
 jacek: Trevor Simon	Grand Master	Benchmark: 23-25
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: he;s a former worldchampion
 MSmits: 3 times in a row
 struct: not bad
 jacek: hmm www48stones is on playok now
 MSmits: yeah he has a busy schedule with people challenging him
 eulerscheZahl: will jacek try too?
 MSmits: if you do, it takes a long time between registering for it and finally getting a timeslot
 MSmits: 2 months for me
 jacek: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: he should just set up a website and automate the games
 struct: The
 eulerscheZahl: would be worth it, considering how much times he spends playing it manually on the other site i think
 struct: Then he would get counterbooked
 jacek: maybe i could try with MSmits first someday
 MSmits: yeah i'd be happy to
 eulerscheZahl: 3 months until you get an appointment with smits
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: nah we can do this most days, I have much free time&#160;:)
 struct: should I give the moves the other player did on backgammon?
 struct: I dont think anyone will use mcts except me
 jacek: why not
 struct: because it would make it harder to crack random
 MSmits: it is impossible to make an uncrackable random?
 jacek: new cg sdk has secure random
 MSmits: i mean uncrackable with reasonable resources
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: because someone cracked prng in contest
 MSmits: last contest?
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: did they win with this?
 eulerscheZahl: 150th or so
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/2">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/2</a>
 jacek: no but someone with heavy search based could use that
 struct: yeah but on a dice based game, cracking it would be way more beneficial
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: its like playing 2048 with known random. not interesting at all eh
 eulerscheZahl: or like dice duel where you can decide yourself how to roll the dice
 eulerscheZahl: what's the point of it?
 jacek: or onitama where you know the cards in 1st turn
 MSmits: onitama is completely deterministic
 MSmits: except the random start
 eulerscheZahl: dice duel too. you didn't get the joke
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: havent played dice duel yet
 MSmits: looked at it a few times when it was new though
 jacek: because you dont have gpu
 MSmits: I do&#160;:)
 jacek: not anymore
 MSmits: what happened to it?
 jacek: when you run dice duel youll know
 MSmits: no i know euler put some fancy 3d in it, runs ok here&#160;:)
 struct: its linux users problem
 eulerscheZahl: it's a linux user causing problems for all of you
 wlesavo: are you telling that the linux users are PEBCAC? :slight_smile:
 struct: no its openGL problem
 Astrobytes: I am summoned
 eulerscheZahl: i decided to create the game and push CG to its limits
 eulerscheZahl: i'm the problem
 Astrobytes: a case of PEBGAF
 Scarfield: Automaton2000 who is the real problem?
 Automaton2000: but what do you use the same code
 Scarfield: also hi smitsi&#160;:) , long time no see 
 dbdr: thanks struct!

 FaycalBorsali: Hello
 EleKtr1X: hi
 FaycalBorsali: I'm new, and have a question, in clash of code, is it possible to choose which type of clash to join (shortest, fastest, ...)&#160;?? thank you
 struct: only for private clashes
 struct: but there are clashes events where you only get 1 language and 1 type
 FaycalBorsali: so if I want to play only shortest, I have to look into private clashes and hope to find what I want&#160;?
 darkhorse64: struct: do not forget ataxx and please give opponent moves in backgammon. There is an interesting MCTS variation to implement 
 struct: :thumbsup:
 IvesL: its 3am in his time, and he still hasnt reached legend
 IvesL: will he sleep or till legend?
 FaycalBorsali: thank you @struct
 struct: FaycalBorsali you can look into events tab
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/events">https://www.codingame.com/events</a>
 struct: oh its ending today the clash one
 struct: Last one is C# fastest
 jacek: MCTS variation?
 FaycalBorsali: Oh&#160;:/
 struct: next clash even starts on 13th
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of clashing events
 eulerscheZahl: did they run out of puzzles already?
 jacek: is there more to this clash site?
 MSmits: hi Scarfield
 dbdr: hey MSmits, good to see you again!
 MSmits: hi dbdr
 dbdr: was sad you didn't do the contest, not your kind of game?
 MSmits: nah I just got distracted by other things. 
 MSmits: i did the oware challenge though. 
 eulerscheZahl: and solaris
 MSmits: oh and yes that&#160;:)
 dbdr: did I miss things?
 MSmits: taking a break from that though, want to focus more  on coding again
 dbdr: what's oware challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: he played a non-bot game
 jacek: :mad:
 MSmits: solaris is just a game. oware challenge is a guy who solved the game (48 seed db) and is challenging people to play him
 struct: he played vs 48 plies book oware
 jacek: 48plies isnt much
 struct: ah not 48 plies
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://48stones.com/research-games-challenge/">https://48stones.com/research-games-challenge/</a>
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: took him 2 months to schedule the match
 eulerscheZahl: he's even listed by name now
 dbdr: is it same rules as CG?
 MSmits: pretty much, no 200 turn limit though
 MSmits: so when an infinite loop happens, you agree to split the remaining seeds
 jacek: no 100k limit
 MSmits: I used it to test my 36 seed DB. A few 100 moves played and his DB agreed with mine every time
 MSmits: I just made a mistake before entering my DB, so it was 23-25 two times
 Scarfield: no opening book?
 eulerscheZahl: and 22.5 - 25.5
 MSmits: yeah, but the opening book doesn't cover everything
 MSmits: there was a chance he'd pick lines of play i was confident at, but he didnt
 struct: this new random is so good that I cant even set a seed...
 MSmits: first game had 35 moves of perfect play though, so the meta mcts was doing a good job. It just took too long to get to 36 seeds
 MSmits: during live play it gets at most 100 games/second so when the tree runs out, I am screwed.
 MSmits: (when i get near a leaf)
 jacek: you were doing meta mcts real time?
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: it has 90 million games played. I was hoping it would not need real time&#160;:)
 MSmits: but all 3 games it did, only for a few moves though
 MSmits: perhaps i should have had an instance of my bot running also
 MSmits: with high search time
 MSmits: but it is not as good as yours, so it might have made a mistake also
 jacek: is this his eval? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/joansalasoler/oware/blob/0ae59a73295cd679e315fed8b4d1220c2beea857/src/com/joansala/oware/OwareGame.java#L435">https://github.com/joansalasoler/oware/blob/0ae59a73295cd679e315fed8b4d1220c2beea857/src/com/joansala/oware/OwareGame.java#L435</a>

 jacek: oh rock paper scissors is back
 NewCoder09: hey
 dbdr: on top oware jacek?

 dbdr: ah :D
 NewCoder09: dbdr any chance you could help me with spider attack silver league to update my code?
 dbdr: what's your problem NewCoder09?
 NewCoder09: So when someone uses a spell on me or a spider i need to be able to get passed that so i don't lose, i need to find out how to make them go at the start, and and i need to learn how to make a new formation for them at the beginning 
 Wontonimo: hey NewCoder09, how are you doing with that advice I gave you about calculating the distance from your hero to a spider
 Wontonimo: and if the spider is in your base and your hero is close enough then wind it to the center
 NewCoder09: all that's going good 
 MichExpatMatt: NewCoder09 you can shield your own guys so they cannot be casted on
 Wontonimo: do you have it working het?
 Wontonimo: *yet
 NewCoder09: MichExpatMatt that might help i didn't think of that 
 NewCoder09: Wontonimo kina 
 NewCoder09: kinda*
 Wontonimo: winding spiders out of your base is more important than shield
 Wontonimo: get the wind working perfectly first
 Dono1: could i get some assistance w/ Power of Thor - Episode 1? idk why  my code doesn't work! lol
 Wontonimo: you'll know it is working perfectly when you play against yourself and both sides don't let a single bug get into your base
 NewCoder09: Yes but when i run that to see how it does i can't use wind because there is a shield on the spider
 thekindboy: guys am i stupid or are the supposed "easy" challenges not easy 
 NewCoder09: There easy your just new you'll get it 
 NewCoder09: they're*
 NewCoder09: oh not new 
 Wontonimo: they are easy if you've been programming professionally as a job for a year or more thekindboy
 Wontonimo: if you haven't finished 8th grade, they'll be super challenging
 MichExpatMatt: NewCoder09 as far as formation, when looping through your 3 heroes, you can use entity ID of your heroes to decide which one goes where - or just use the index value of the loop
 NewCoder09: Dono1 sure i could help you real wuick 
 NewCoder09: quick*
 thekindboy: Ok thanks
 Dono1: How should I show you my current code, @NewCoder09
 Wontonimo: in private chat
 Wontonimo: use tech.io snip
 NewCoder09: MichExpatMatt ok 
 [Constanze]: I code as a hobby for now, but I feel like some easy challanges get pretty hard at some of the last test cases, but it may be just because I haven't been coding long enough...
 MichExpatMatt: [Constanze] I think that's intentional by the contributor. The tests eventually force you to account for edge cases in one way or another, that or just really complex scenarios  to make sure your algorithm truly works or to force you to write something more time-effiecient
 Ayza: Anyway to tell which direction your hero is facing relative to the spider? because, I can tell when to wind the spider but if the spider is facing my base and my hero is facing the base aswell, it just winds it into the base and makes me lose. any help?
 MichExpatMatt: I thought wind was area of effect, meaning you give the x,y coordinates of which direction you want to push wind, and then everything within 1280 of your hero gets pushed towards that x,y coordinate
 MichExpatMatt: so if you put the center of the map, or the opponents base, or some other corner that is not your base, as your coordinates, you should push towards that point instead of your base, regardless of your hero's last movement
 Ayza: I see, thanks for the tip mich
 MichExpatMatt: np
 Ayza: because I've been giving it the spider's coordinates, so that makes a lot of sense now
 IvesL: chokudai failed
 jacek: oO
 struct: to be fair the game is not easy
 struct: jacek get your NN ready
 jacek: backgammon and NN? would that work?
 jacek: and dont tell you would train it with TD
 struct: I meant for rock paper sicssors
 struct: What is TD?
 jacek: temporal difference

 struct: Maybe I can finish without graphics today
 jacek: you can borrow from dice duel
 struct: Im not  sure
 struct: The dices look nice
 struct: But I dont really wanna waste time on 3d stuff
 jacek: and they dont sum to 7 :x
 struct: What do you mean?
 jacek: generaly in dice opposite sides sum to 7
 jacek: but euler couldnt find good looking dice like that
 struct: ah
 waterproofsodium: hey struct
 waterproofsodium: almighty
 struct: hi
 waterproofsodium: why do they ask "what skills I acquired" at the end of a problem?
 waterproofsodium: does checking them have any effect on my profile?
 struct: yes
 struct: it will show in your profile
 waterproofsodium: cool
 waterproofsodium: ty
 waterproofsodium: I will level up at midnight
 waterproofsodium: yay
 waterproofsodium: (meaning rank xD, curious where I land now)
 jacek: still mad pod racing&#160;?
 waterproofsodium: i took the formula and got gold I think
 jacek: woah youre in gold
 waterproofsodium: yeah
 waterproofsodium: pod racing is interesting but rn I don't have the time to spare
 waterproofsodium: it's definitely a more specialiced skill xD
 waterproofsodium: also gm jacek
 Pilodro: Use the distance from base of the spider, and the hero. 
 Pilodro: omg, that log wondered...
 dot.nick: so do code golf points not exist yet
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey dot.nick, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 MichExpatMatt: If you win at code golf in a clash you'll get points but as far as I know that's it
 struct: ... was looking at backgammon board and it had wrong starting setup
 struct: was wondering why mine was wrong
 dot.nick: dang i thought id get ranking from doing the multiplayer code golfs like the ranking tooltip says
 struct: you mean clash?
 struct: or the code golf category puzzles?
 struct: You do get ranking from both
 struct: But it updates only once daily
 dot.nick: hmm it was yesterday but i guess it hasnt been 24 hr
 struct: it updates in 2 hours+-
 dot.nick: 00:00 utc?
 struct: I think so
 dot.nick: cool thanks
 waterproofsodium: i'm curios too
 Nik0Lo: hey, id like organize a clash of code with friends.. any recommended point system if we were to do a couple of rounds?
 InstantWin: should i put clash on my CV
 Twelve0: Hey
 Twelve0: I have a problem in my CG account, I don't receive notification
 Twelve0: like clash of code invites
 Twelve0: I checked the settings, notifications are on
 waterproofsodium: finally
 waterproofsodium: did that parsing problem
 waterproofsodium: with resistors
 waterproofsodium: woah some people write inefficient code. just to finish quickly
 waterproofsodium: I don't do it. I fear creating a bad habbit
 Ayza: I mean the whole point is to finish as quick as possible, but you got a point
 waterproofsodium: Ayza you mean in clash? or where?
 Ayza: clash, do you mean something else?
 waterproofsodium: na clash. But I do it for practice
 waterproofsodium: so when is that score update gonna happen. sigh
 waterproofsodium: ah rn
 waterproofsodium: yay I'm below 6k :D
 waterproofsodium: some dude challenged me with it yesterday "get bellow 6k"
 adamgosnell: During Legends of Code &amp; Magic, did anyone else have the problem where they're only getting inputs for the right-most card?
 Link_jon: zero is bigger than 2 now
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Link_jon, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 2 tacos
 Link_jon: hoooorray
 Link_jon: (insert sarcasm but slightly les now there is tacos)
 Andres_brek: Ã±
 dpdog: owo 
 Link_jon: appearntly CG's version of lua doesnt like the word 'not'
 Wontonimo: it's not not compatible 
 Wontonimo: that's a not not joke
 struct: o.o
 struct: I think my ref is pretty much ready
 struct: maybe I can finish viewer tomorrow
 struct: Have you ever played backgammon Wontonimo?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't knock the not knock not joke
 Wontonimo: yeah, i've played 25 years ago.  don't remember it much
 Wontonimo: :grin: PatrickMcGinnisII
 struct: ok you played more than me probabyl
 struct: Writing the statement for it will be fun...
 Wontonimo: maybe copy it from wikipedia
 struct: I usually just add a link to wikipedia
 struct: so people can read the rules
 struct: Writing the statement takes more time than coding the engine
 Wontonimo: ha!  I haven't written a multi yet, but that's funny
 StevenV: hello guyz
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey StevenV, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 StevenV:&#160;?
 StevenV: is antiwonto a bot?
 StevenV: what is Featured Puzzle?
 Wontonimo: yes, antiwonto is a bot
 Wontonimo: it's the puzzle that is "featured"
 Wontonimo: nothing more
 Wontonimo: i don't know which one it is thhis week though, if that's your question
 coderhobbit: Just now stepping into data structures and algos. This a good way to learn??\
 Ayza: If you understand exactly how it works, yes
 Ayza: If you just learn how to implement it, no
 coderhobbit: Ok so basically understand what its asking me to do and implement a solution. Does that mean i come up  with an algo or do I research one applicable to the problem?
 StevenV: so I think it is one of the puzzle from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>, isn't it?
 StevenV: or it would be designed each week?
 RivalRickson: hi

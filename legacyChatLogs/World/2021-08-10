 holite: hello guys i am ney hee
 holite: new here will you be my friend
 holite: i am from india
 BlaiseEbuth: Hello, from india
 michaellan: hello, ney hee
 michaellan: should i expect 100 iterations of tic tac toe to end in a draw?
 michaellan: my bot is occasionally not ending in a draw even at 350 iterations
 michaellan: even 1000 got a win, after testing like 20 times
 Westicles: Doesn't it always end in a draw unless you are playing someone with brain damage?
 michaellan: yeah
 michaellan: but apparently 100 iterations each move is not good enough?
 yingchuann: may i know what is imax?
 michaellan: or the theater
 BlaiseEbuth: or max with i before
 yingchuann: hahahha im solving the descent in codinggame 
 michaellan: oh thats perfect
 michaellan: which language has imax function?
 michaellan: it's generally called argmax, in math and other fields
 yingchuann: im newbie in here so not really know abt it
 yingchuann: im using python
 michaellan: im not sure such a function exists (other than in numpy)
 yingchuann: i see... its okay whahahah
 BlaiseEbuth: Nobody said that's a function though
 michaellan: yeah but imax sounds specific
 michaellan: also, I see a lot of people using the
 michaellan: while (i still have time left this turn) { run simulation/iteration }
 michaellan: i wonder if the condition in the while loop of getting the current time has overhead
 Westicles: Let wontimo answer, he is building up mp
 BlaiseEbuth: mp?
 Westicles: mod points
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. right
 BlaiseEbuth: Wontonimod
 michaellan: wontonimod ftw

 derjack: lets do the puzzle of the week
 tduck973564: vn
 ChirathPansilu: mandeya
 ReiKiriyama: any hints for puzzle of the week? Very new to "bitboarding" and minimax algorithm. 
 HadjAliMazen: hello 
 HadjAliMazen:&#160;!
 Wontonimo: o/
 Wontonimo: what is the puzzle of the week/
 Wontonimo: oh it's Amazons by struct!  Congrats struct
 Wontonimo: hey ReiKiriyama, you don't need to have experience with bitboarding.  That is only needed to get to the top of the leaderboard.
 ReiKiriyama: okay, so I will try it without that. :smiley:
 derjack: just make the best moves. ezpz
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: (that's me throwing up my hands)
 derjack: score 6.66 :tada:
 derjack: oh my tric trac got serious
 Wontonimo: i just saw that also.
 Wontonimo: your tric trac sure is surging in the ranks
 MidOrFeed: how do you find the puzzle of the week?
 Wontonimo: it is in your notifications
 Wontonimo: the bell icon top right
 advait7: leo messi -&gt; psg 😎
 MidOrFeed: ahh thank you!
 derjack: messi in psg? oO
 advait7: yep
 advait7: its official

 derjack: thats canadian sorry
 Wontonimo: one day Canada will take over the world, then everyone will be sorry
 Pro-grammer: wo what an other pro-grammer?
 Pro-grammer: damn
 Pro-grammer: sorry for stealing your name
 Pro-grammer: (i'm canadian to XD)
 Pro-grammer: omg sorry for the typo
 Wontonimo: no, I'm sorry I didn't put your name right in the original message
 HadjAliMazen: hello! 
 HadjAliMazen: hellooooo 
 Wontonimo: hey
 HadjAliMazen: "hello"* 50
 HadjAliMazen: how are u doing here
 BlaiseEbuth: Caribous reign is coming
 Wontonimo: good thanks.  What kind of coding background you got HadjAliMazen&#160;?
 HadjAliMazen: Python @wontonimo
 Wontonimo: nice
 HadjAliMazen: DS
 HadjAliMazen: data scio
 Wontonimo: what kind of stuff you've been working on lately in DS&#160;?
 derjack: nintendo DS?
 HadjAliMazen: yy

 Pro-grammer: isn't the api deprecated?
 martinpapa69: D Simulator
 Pro-grammer: on
 Pro-grammer: oh*
 Pro-grammer: lol
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: why did you create a tag 5%&#160;?
 Stilgart: (I have lost so much time on that one that my english is broken)
 eulerscheZahl: it screws up with URL encoding, doesn't it? :P
 eulerscheZahl: that was a rhetorical question, wasn't it? you know the 5% story?
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl is there a way that somebody doesn't know about it&#160;?
 Stilgart: wasn't it 1.84% in the end&#160;?
 Stilgart: and yes, my urls are broken :rage:
 BlaiseEbuth: Numbers these days...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/5%25">https://www.codingame.com/learn/5%25</a>
 Wontonimo: my progress 0%&#160;;(  guess i'm not in the 5% lol
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: I am fixing it
 eulerscheZahl: don't bother. Thibaud told me it will never become an official tag
 Stilgart: might as well put an if for this one
 Stilgart: but it is official, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: suggestion: on your list of puzzles name the creator instead of just an "x" for community
 eulerscheZahl: i know that tag list
 Stilgart: the most official tag list ever
 eulerscheZahl: does it update when tags for approved puzzles get changed?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1magmoi">https://prnt.sc/1magmoi</a>the google preview still gets the full list of tags
 Stilgart: updated daily
 eulerscheZahl: and somehow my google search lead me to this github stats page that i've never seen before <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://giters.com/eulerscheZahl">https://giters.com/eulerscheZahl</a>
 Stilgart: i was tryng to figure out why I got a tag 5%
 Stilgart: but in the end, it is a perfectly legit tag
 eulerscheZahl: apparently my most used language is javascript. shouldn't have uploaded the full three.js library :D
 Stilgart: (with a perfectly broken url)
 eulerscheZahl: i was a little salty when I published Tryangle Catch. The tag is a witness of that. :angel:
 Stilgart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_languages.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_languages.html</a> says it is C#
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't even seen that list before. is that new?
 Stilgart: (this one has no update yet)
 Stilgart: more alpha than new, actually
 eulerscheZahl: that's just the language each player uses most and the solutions in that one language?
 eulerscheZahl: total puzzle solves would be more interesting. but probably not feasible without spamming the API
 4DsErfan: Have you ever saw an ordak?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know what that is
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: this one is already spamming the API... and I do not want to add a loop on the ~750 puzzles
 BlaiseEbuth: You can. The CG infra is perfectly able to manage.
 eulerscheZahl: once I downloaded 5GB of replay data. just for some statistics about the Ocean of Code contest. I'm totally not proud of it
 BlaiseEbuth: The CG infra is perfectly able to manage.
 eulerscheZahl: when you send too many requests in a short amount of time, you'll get an error
 eulerscheZahl: then you have to wait for a minute or two until you can download any more replays
 NorbecioMambo: Hi boys and girls,
 BlaiseEbuth: See. The API protect the infra.
 eulerscheZahl: you can use about 5 parallel connections without getting blocked
 BlaiseEbuth: CG technology :copyright:
 NorbecioMambo: Ive got a particular problem. I understand all functions and definitions of coding no problem but I find it very difficult to start a project from scratch. Does anyone have tips for me or is someone keen to guide me through a problem?
 holite: hello bullshit
 eulerscheZahl: mind your language
 holite: hello poop
 eulerscheZahl: blaise was faster
 Edvards: hello
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm doing the mod's job... :rolling_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: NorbecioMambo that's a very open question. I always struggle to answer these. unless you have more explicit questions, you are probably better off with some googling
 NorbecioMambo: Cheers
 martinpapa69: does any1 have a public imlementation for a clean mcts solver
 martinpapa69: my implementation is ugly
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if mine counts as clean either <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg">https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: did that long before the C4 multi on CG
 eulerscheZahl: colleages from work asked me for an easter egg in one of my applications. now when they click at the program name, it will change to "four in a row" and open the game :D
 martinpapa69: are you sure its mcts solver?
 martinpapa69: not mcts
 martinpapa69: 			// MCTS solver
 martinpapa69: do you handle the draw terminal nodes as wll&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: at least it drove one of my colleagues mad because it told him like 10 turns before that he lost
 eulerscheZahl: i think i don't. wrote that a while ago
 reCurse: AI in games has a different goal
 reCurse: When humans are involved
 eulerscheZahl: it's still not that strong and totally beatable (low sim count)
 martinpapa69: ye you dont handle the case when a node has only -1 children
 eulerscheZahl: the last turns were mostly forced moves. just 2 or 3 columns left to play with
 BlaiseEbuth: -1 children&#160;?
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bdd8f6c2-61da-4e45-8312-f3bbb7717736">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bdd8f6c2-61da-4e45-8312-f3bbb7717736</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my scores are 0, 0.5, 1
 martinpapa69: ik
 AllYourTrees: all children are losses for you =&gt; node is a loss
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off :bicycle:
 eulerscheZahl: :bike:
 martinpapa69: you wuld tell 20 turns ahead that you won
 martinpapa69: my implementation even propagates draw terminal nodes
 martinpapa69: but in a very ugly way
 AllYourTrees: draws are the same as losses right? can only say its a draw once all children are proven and theres at least 1 draw?
 Wontonimo: that is a really nice code snippet euler!  Do you mind if i link to that when people ask about MCTS?
 martinpapa69: if there are -1, -1, 0, -1 children
 martinpapa69: the node is a draw
 AllYourTrees: ya
 BlaiseEbuth: Just do it Wontonimod
 Wontonimo: thanks ... lol Wontonimod 
 Wontonimo: martinpapa, how are you keeping track of draw during backprop solver?  Do you have another flag in the Node for draw, or are you just hard changing the total reward to 0
 martinpapa69: i have a solved flag for the nodes, and a value integer
 Wontonimo: great, thanks
 martinpapa69: on children selection i calculate the max value for solved children
 martinpapa69: nonsolved children= guaranteed loss
 martinpapa69: and if every children is solved
 martinpapa69: the node becomes solved
 martinpapa69: and the max value is its value
 martinpapa69: if the is a win child
 Wontonimo: what?  how can unsolved children = guaranteed loss?
 martinpapa69: the node automatically becomes win
 sugam: I gave the test from the career section myself and got good points. 
 martinpapa69: its just a technical stuff
 sugam: do companies get to chose what quesitons to include in the test or is the difficulty random 
 Astrobytes: sugam: there's no real need to post on the discord AND in webchat
 martinpapa69: when a node has an unsolved child, and doenst have a winner child, the node is unsolved
 sugam:&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: You want the job? Toss a coin
 AllYourTrees: :dice:
 AllYourTrees: 🎲
 BlaiseEbuth: Who need a job these days...
 martinpapa69: my father always told: work is for the poor
 BlaiseEbuth: A wise man.
 sugam: damn imagine being poor
 MSmits: snobs :P

 jacek: you dared to click my link?
 FalINTOblivion0112: the puzzle of the week is kinda wack
 AllYourTrees: how so
 FalINTOblivion0112: its not a puzzle
 holite: hello guys
 FalINTOblivion0112: good morning and hello
 holite: um its night maby beacause i live in india 
 Wontonimo: why would living in India make it night?  The sun is up in the sky now.  Maybe it's just cloudy there you mean
 Wontonimo: :P
 Jon...: :thinking:
 valgardg: up no its 9pm there
 valgardg: uh*
 valgardg: `/s`
 Jon...: I like to pretend timezones don't exist myself, makes my life alot easier while programming :wink:
 valgardg: how so
 Jon...: Not having to consider timezones when processing data! I'm joking of course
 valgardg: oh haha
 valgardg: yes i understand now lmao
 Jon...: In the past when I worked on a payment clearing and settlement system the timezones gave us hell.  More because of twisted legacy requirements than anything else though
 TobiasA: there goes my braincells
 valgardg: huh yeah i can imagine... must be agonizing
 Wontonimo: but you have to admit, all that timezone work sure paid the bills :drum:
 Jon...: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: it is not that easy to put the creator instead of an x&#160;:(
 Scarfield: tom scott made a video about timezones, it looked extremely painfull to work with
 martinpapa69: my bot has too many draws during the training with mcts solver&#160;:(
 martinpapa69: it learns that every game is a draw
 AllYourTrees: sounds like a bug
 AllYourTrees: or its so good that it solved teh game lol
 AllYourTrees: what game is that for?
 martinpapa69: oware
 AllYourTrees: oh nvm haven't worked with that one
 martinpapa69: not sure if its a bug, or i jsut have to turn the solver off for the training
 AllYourTrees: i have solver on during training for C4
 martinpapa69: ye i too had my old solver on, worked well. but with my improved one it overfits
 valgardg: ive heard alot about using algorithms to solve alot of coding quetsions. is it worth diving into all these algorithms and if so where do i find this stuff??
 AllYourTrees: whats the improved one?
 martinpapa69: now I actually backpropagate the terminal nodes, not just set terminal ones during selection
 FalINTOblivion0112: guys i finished top 100 in a contest but i didn't get the achievement
 FalINTOblivion0112: whats the problem
 RoboStac: was it the sogeti contest last week?
 Scarfield: lol, just realised i never reset my variables for winning/losing, in mcts C4. how this even worked im not sure of xD
 BlaiseEbuth: Scarforgot
 Scarfield: its even getting about the same rank after fix. makes no sense
 jrke: oh C4 also in 300 players club
 AllYourTrees: :cheer:
 Scarfield: yup, and im in top 300 :muscle:
 AllYourTrees: LOL
 jacek: connect4 is so last week
 jacek: amazons is so this week
 Scarfield: old school cool *
 BlaiseEbuth: Once again not my puzzle...
 Scarfield: you made a puzzle? :o
 PMierzwa: I am in wood 1 in the coders strike back, but i beat the boss every time.. how do i get to next league?
 BlaiseEbuth: But this time this is clearly puprposely.&#160;:(
 jrke: you have to submit it PMierzwa
 jacek: you need to be above he boss in leaderboard after the submit is over
 Scarfield: your score has to be higher than the boss after finished submot
 jrke: and wait until submission ends
 Scarfield: just so you know PMierzwa, the inputs change when you league up for some of the leagues in CSB, so if you rank up and your bot starts failing, thats why
 Katespizer: is it normal that i have to complete captcha like 5 times per day
 BlaiseEbuth: Be more human, and this will stop.
 martinpapa69: you filthy spamsubmitter
 PMierzwa: thank you, it makes sense now&#160;:)
 jacek: captcha? in this site? w00t
 Scarfield: Katespizer if you play a lot of clash of code, or spam submit you will see captchas afaik
 Katespizer: i guess, i've played like 1000 before and saw it one time, but from yesterday i saw it couple of times, but i was getting easy problems, so maybe everything is as it should
 martinpapa69: if you get flagget for non-humanness you wil lget captchas for a while
 martinpapa69: for 1-2 days
 Scarfield: function argument as reference; int&amp; var, or int &amp;var? 
 martinpapa69: int&amp; obviously
 Scarfield: yea pretty much everything i read uses that, for some reason i just think int &amp;var is easier to spot as a reference when looking through code
 martinpapa69: one thing i dont like in c/c++, that you cant int* a, b; 
 martinpapa69: you have to int *a, *b
 martinpapa69: not that i declare 2 poiters at the same time often
 MSmits: it's weird 
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: the * is part of the type in my mind
 MSmits: i even write it as int* a
 MSmits: not int *a
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... It's weird to declare two var on the same line! :scream:
 MSmits: well that too
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the point: Code clean, and this 'problem' will even not appear...
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: there are 152 codingamers that have created a puzzle but that my app do not know about
 Stilgart: (seems a bit too high)
 BlaiseEbuth: Censorship! :scream:
 Stilgart: two solutions:
 Stilgart: 1/ I add all of them in my db
 Stilgart: 2/ I put a userId when I do not have the entire data
 Stilgart: problem is... the userId is not very useful
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like you have to add more users. or just store the creator as a string without full info on XP, profile URL, ...
 FalINTOblivion0112: who is AutomatonNN 
 FalINTOblivion0112: a user?
 jacek: lets ask Automaton2000
 FalINTOblivion0112: sure!
 Automaton2000: what is the maximum number of players
 BlaiseEbuth: A close friend of eulerscheZahl
 Scarfield: "MSmits 07:06PMthe * is part of the type in my mind"yea thats what i figured would be the reason to write it like that, but with the IDE colors int *a is just easier to spot
 FalINTOblivion0112: hey Automaton2000 didnt initalize or declare variable type
 Automaton2000: just what i needed to get to bronze
 eulerscheZahl: now that NN is dead, BlaiseEbuth is pinging me?&#160;:/
 FalINTOblivion0112: int numberOfPlayers = 1000;
 FalINTOblivion0112: or am i wrong
 MSmits: ahh ok Scarfield
 MSmits: which NN died?
 Scarfield: the automaton one
 MSmits: oh
 Scarfield: apparently
 FalINTOblivion0112: when did AutomatonNN say that eulerscheZahl is a noob
 MSmits: well people were pinging euler before to train the NN
 MSmits: to make him ping euler too
 eulerscheZahl: some also tried to teach it cat emojis. didn't work
 Scarfield: the prize of being no. 1
 MSmits: it did use the weird trick that breaks the chat and it starts leaking
 martinpapa69: ye i too think * belongs to the type but, int* a, b show that the creators of c didnt think that way
 eulerscheZahl: and there's this one thing that I learned from the bot: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 MSmits: oh noes
 Scarfield: nooo
 eulerscheZahl: oh yes!
 Scarfield: xD
 FalINTOblivion0112: ah yes
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: for now, I will store additionnal info in the puzzle table
 Scarfield: sigh
 AllYourTrees: RIP
 eulerscheZahl: never gets old
 AllYourTrees: how long does it last for
 eulerscheZahl: the end&#160;:(
 FalINTOblivion0112: very nice now what is this vertical thing
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh, I'm sorry.&#160;:(eulerscheZahl, is there a way to be forgiven?
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 FalINTOblivion0112: what as that?
 eulerscheZahl: some funny unicode
 Scarfield: weird unicode stuff
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh okay
 eulerscheZahl: you can copy-paste it
 AllYourTrees: what unicode character is that
 FalINTOblivion0112: :smiling_imp:
 Scarfield: it will delete system 32 if you use it wrong though
 eulerscheZahl: 0xCC 0xA4and these 2 bytes repeated many times

 Scarfield: no idea, havent been on for a few months, only the past few days
 eulerscheZahl: was announced in an email i received for whatever reason
 Astrobytes: ah right yeah
 Astrobytes: Not done it
 eulerscheZahl: me neither
 Astrobytes: Sherlock right?
 Scarfield: yea as euler said
 Astrobytes: Oh, missed that :D
 Scarfield: struct is on CG vacation thoug&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Can do it when he returns I guess
 Scarfield: sure&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: is it still for free or do they already collect money?
 Astrobytes: No you can still play that one and the previous ones for free I believe. Any others are paid for iirc
 Scarfield: looked like sherlock was free, all the "newer" ones were pro accounts though
 eulerscheZahl: plural? they are adding lots of them?
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/games">https://escape.codingame.com/games</a>
 eulerscheZahl: can't scroll, have to complete the poll first. but i don't want to
 eulerscheZahl: asking for my coding level
 Scarfield: 7 pro account ones, 4 of them looks different from the free ones
 Scarfield: 3 free
 Astrobytes: eh. Rescue and 80s paid for now 
 Scarfield: yea&#160;:/
 michaellan: what else are they planning to paywall on this site?
 Astrobytes: They were a good laugh though. Most of the fun comes from just communicating in a team tho' 
 Astrobytes: T Bali was like the Dungeon Master
 <b>**jacek never played escape</b></p><p><img src="/a/22238461634817" /> Scarfield: yea definately was fun, but not because of the coding challenge, struct and tbali did all the work anyway xD
 Astrobytes: Nah. We did some problem solving
 Scarfield: im just here for my looks
 Astrobytes: Was defo easier with the mic
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: you could get the same/more fun out of an actual game. im definately not gonna pay for escape
 Astrobytes: Hell no. Guess it could be fun for companies though
 Astrobytes: *worth it and fun
 Scarfield: yea, probably their target as well
 Astrobytes: It is
 eulerscheZahl: i played half a room. not my cup of tea
 eulerscheZahl: then i ditched the team and went to bed
 FalINTOblivion0112: i played mean max irl with my friends
 Astrobytes: lol
 FalINTOblivion0112: i was driving the reaper, it was fun
 jacek: in reinforcement learning?
 FalINTOblivion0112: it was for mean max irl
 jacek: ~
 Astrobytes: whoosh
 FalINTOblivion0112: driving the reaper was the best
 FalINTOblivion0112: driving the doof was the worst
 eulerscheZahl: i have a hard time imagining how this works
 Astrobytes: +1
 FalINTOblivion0112: you go in a random dirt place
 FalINTOblivion0112: grab a bunch of cars
 FalINTOblivion0112: and DRIVE
 FalINTOblivion0112: no casualties
 eulerscheZahl: did you collect water with some buckets?
 Scarfield: xD
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes we dod
 jacek: and spit the oil
 Astrobytes: And all the violence
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 FalINTOblivion0112: we first only had reapers
 FalINTOblivion0112: then we brought in the destroyeres
 FalINTOblivion0112: weaponized
 eulerscheZahl: the doof was meant to have flames coming out while generating rage. but CG didn't want to pay for the visual effects
 FalINTOblivion0112: no
 Astrobytes: lol
 FalINTOblivion0112: but we did implement a propane ignition system
 FalINTOblivion0112: to destroy the tankers
 eulerscheZahl: this sounds totally made up to me
 jacek: yeah, moderators salaries took most of the budget
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i got so many tshirts from CG
 Astrobytes: It sounds extremely far fetched to me too
 FalINTOblivion0112: well we did blow stuff up
 FalINTOblivion0112: blowing stuff up isn't far fetched
 Astrobytes: Robots I could believe
 eulerscheZahl: playing paper soccer in real life could work
 FalINTOblivion0112: let's say this - mean max is a fun game
 Scarfield: im off for today, enjoy your evening&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :P
 FalINTOblivion0112: we can all agree on that right?
 Astrobytes: Take care Scarfield&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1mdvkua">https://prnt.sc/1mdvkua</a>good guy scarfiled, pushing me up
 jacek: c4?
 eulerscheZahl: at least when I cut the screenshot right there and don't extend it
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 jacek: good guys eveyone, pushing me up in amazons
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if switching from MCTS to solver is worth it
 jacek: you dont have solver?
 eulerscheZahl: i have that C# solver
 martinpapa69: solver is big
 eulerscheZahl: then started from scratch for a faster sim
 eulerscheZahl: and C++ port
 eulerscheZahl: ok, then i'll put the solver back in tomorrow
 michaellan: whats solver?
 eulerscheZahl: i have that rule: no coding after 8pm. only results in garbage code and not worth the struggle
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 eulerscheZahl: solver: see it as a mix of MCTS and minimax
 jacek: mcts solver paper :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: in some cases you know the outcome. at least for the last step of a longer chain
 michaellan: i've been told you can use solver after your MCTS has hit the terminal leafs
 eulerscheZahl: then you can backpropagate the outcome with more runs
 michaellan: like you basically auto-prune losinig choices
 michaellan: oh
 michaellan: wdym by that exactly?
 michaellan: just increase the weight? like x10 visits and x10 score
 eulerscheZahl: there's the paper for a detailed version
 eulerscheZahl: the idea is that you find a way that makes a player win at some point
 martinpapa69: surprisingly easy to understand paper
 eulerscheZahl: so the move right before, which allows that win, is a loss for the opponent
 linjoehan: man my rank is dropping. what the fastes way to get back up? please don't say clashes.
 eulerscheZahl: if a node results in all actions being a loss for the opponent, then again it's a win
 eulerscheZahl: and you can go up to the root with enough runs
 eulerscheZahl: so MCTS solver is like a minimax with a depth high enough to see the end of the game
 eulerscheZahl: given enough time
 eulerscheZahl: linjoehan <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/?user=cedc01b66272d83d567143b93f115d5e3331661">http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/?user=cedc01b66272d83d567143b93f115d5e3331661</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there are many answers for you
 eulerscheZahl: i suggest back to the code
 michaellan: can you incorporate the solver just by messing with the backprop values, or must it be coded specially into the MCTS?
 michaellan: like it sounds like if all children are losing then you can backprop -infinity
 michaellan: wait, +infinity
 eulerscheZahl: you only have to touch the backpropagation
 martinpapa69: i couldnt implement it without helper variables on the node
 seshoumara: hi
 michaellan: so you have some flag like isDefiniteLoss?
 seshoumara: what is bitboarding?
 martinpapa69: i have a flag node_solved, and a integer value
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e210e1b2-a371-4825-ba6b-a8deddbf3ea4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e210e1b2-a371-4825-ba6b-a8deddbf3ea4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: short snippet to give you an idea. not a full solver. just 1 layer up
 eulerscheZahl: and I should probably set the result of the parent node too, now that I look at it
 martinpapa69: i even have a bitset for the children solved
 martinpapa69: so i dont have to iterate every time
 DylanDuault: Hi&#160;! Do any of you guys use the codingame sync&#160;? I wonder if it's outdated
 martinpapa69: (if children_solved.all() node-&gt;set_solved())
 eulerscheZahl: i'll probably just remove that one child, now that  i'm thinking about it
 martinpapa69: i store them in a vector
 martinpapa69: not easy to remove
 eulerscheZahl: swap child with the last one. then reduce size
 martinpapa69: hmm
 martinpapa69: good idea
 eulerscheZahl: vector would be an option. I have that fixed size array
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0c61d18-6c03-4fab-a0e7-802ebca45316">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0c61d18-6c03-4fab-a0e7-802ebca45316</a>
 69razer69: name a country
 michaellan: eulerscheZahl so you are basically collapsing intermediate nodes?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm removing terminal nodes
 martinpapa69: sounds like a clean solution
 michaellan: i don't quite get the pathIndex
 eulerscheZahl: just have to make sure that the root keeps at least 1 valid action even if i lose. better playing bad than crashing
 eulerscheZahl: the path stores all the nodes along my current rollout
 eulerscheZahl: i need that for backpropagation
 69razer69: how to change genre of the contribution , i wrote a lote of things 
 eulerscheZahl: like chaning from clash to normal puzzle?
 michaellan: &gt; nodes along my current rollout
 69razer69: yup
 michaellan: i thought rollout was just a small simulation
 eulerscheZahl: you can't. delete the old one and create a new
 michaellan: you're creating intermediate nodes for each stage of the rollout?
 69razer69: ok
 eulerscheZahl: rollout = from current board state until there is a winner
 michaellan: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: or no more moves and tie
 michaellan: understood
 eulerscheZahl: and each intermediate step is in my path array
 michaellan: oh, isnt that costly?
 eulerscheZahl: and each intermediate node gets a score update
 michaellan: whats the benefit of storing intermediate steps
 eulerscheZahl: of course it is. but that's how MCTS works. you get more and more statistics for each node about a good next move
 Astrobytes: don't create new nodes during the rollout
 michaellan: I guess my question is, is Node*[] storing the nodes you took in the Selection phase, or the states you played out in the rollout?
 michaellan: Node*[] path
 eulerscheZahl: the ones i played and that altered the game state
 michaellan: I am very confused if I am doing rollout correctly
 michaellan: This is my rollout code for normal TTT <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ix.io/3vzY">http://ix.io/3vzY</a>
 Astrobytes: simulate the game from that node, use the result to score that node and backprop up the tree
 michaellan: yeah but it seems euler is saving the intermediate states of the rollout?
 eulerscheZahl: uint16_t move = random_bit(available_moves(s.boards[0], s.boards[1]));
 michaellan: i am so confused
 eulerscheZahl: that's not how move selection works
 michaellan: oops
 King_JulienN: how does one bite a wolf?
 michaellan: how does move selection work
 eulerscheZahl: there's a formula. it looks at the winrate of number of plays for each child node
 michaellan: oh. i guess i'm doing a "naive" MCTS here right
 Astrobytes: that's just random moves for the playout euler
 jacek: flat monte carlo?
 eulerscheZahl: fully random is somewhat working too. but far weaker
 michaellan: alrighty
 michaellan: but how useful is storing the winrate of each child? because the next time you encounter it, you expand the node to its children already
 eulerscheZahl: how do you know which move lead to the win/loss?
 michaellan: what do you mean? which move inside the rollout itself?
 eulerscheZahl: race condition in chat
 eulerscheZahl: i was talking about your code. let's answer your question first
 eulerscheZahl: of course the winrates for each node change over time
 eulerscheZahl: that's why you have to backpropagate your results
 michaellan: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and then it is helpful. when you know that one move was almost always winning so far, you want to try that again and find a counter
 eulerscheZahl: or realize that you can enforce a win. in this case the other options don't matter anymore
 michaellan: how is this information stored then? is it within the node?
 jacek: yes
 eulerscheZahl: each node has its own stats for plays and wins
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/MCTS-steps.svg/1920px-MCTS-steps.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/MCTS-steps.svg/1920px-MCTS-steps.svg.png</a>
 michaellan: but thats what i do...
 eulerscheZahl: .sgv.pngthat file extension is pure cruelty
 eulerscheZahl: svg*
 jacek: .png.jpg
 eulerscheZahl: oh no!
 jacek: + transparency
 michaellan: i think i miscommunicated
 michaellan: i am not wondering about that
 michaellan: i am just confused what your path variable is for
 eulerscheZahl: to still remember where to backpropagate to
 michaellan: cant you just keep going up to your parent?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't store a parent in each node
 Astrobytes: He doesn't store the parent on the node
 michaellan: ohh
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: takes less memory without
 michaellan: big oversight on my part
 michaellan: yeah
 michaellan: well its just a pointer type
 eulerscheZahl: 8 byte * 5e6 nodes
 Astrobytes: Node size matters if you need a lot
 michaellan: yikes, true
 Astrobytes: You don't even have to store children
 Astrobytes: just indices
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Sell the children.
 michaellan: indices out of some large pool of Nodes?
 michaellan: is that what you're saying
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes. Index + offset (childcount)
 michaellan: my brain is going to explode
 eulerscheZahl: i went for readability here and store the pointer to the child nodes
 BlaiseEbuth: That's Ok, you don't need it to live these days.
 eulerscheZahl: give it some time to settle xxd
 eulerscheZahl: once you understood it, it all makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: coding it for the first time will still be tricky and make your head hurt
 michaellan: It seems like I'll never be able to stop tinkering with my MCTS implementation
 michaellan: there's always improvements
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure. And ask again if you need clarification. It's a bit odd until you get used to it.
 martinpapa69: ye having an mcts alog is like having a pet
 michaellan: i'm stuck between implementing this index+offset/not-storing-parent optimizations and coding up another game to test my current MCTS on
 Astrobytes: lol, so true
 eulerscheZahl: just make it work first
 michaellan: i think it works
 eulerscheZahl: you can think about performance later
 eulerscheZahl: oh nice
 eulerscheZahl: but you don't have the winrate. you select children fully random
 michaellan: no...
 michaellan: I am still confused
 Astrobytes: that's the sim euler
 michaellan: i have the winrate for nodes in my tree
 michaellan: thats the rollout, not selection
 michaellan: the code i sent earlier^
 Astrobytes: it's his random playout code
 michaellan: I am pretty sure I am using the right terminology here
 Astrobytes: It's a minefield, don't worry
 michaellan: *This* is my selection code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ix.io/3vA0">http://ix.io/3vA0</a> feedback appreciated
 jacek: scarminefield?
 martinpapa69: too many std::shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt;
 michaellan: what should i do instead
 eulerscheZahl: does this call UCB multiple times per node?
 michaellan: oh crap
 michaellan: i think so
 eulerscheZahl: not sure what exactly max_element does
 michaellan: URHHHHGHGH
 michaellan: yeah it probably does
 michaellan: okay this is an easy fix though
 Astrobytes: yeah - don't do that
 michaellan: i can just loop over it
 michaellan: reject STL, return to monke C
 Astrobytes: you can also calc one part outside and the less costly part in the loop
 Peterpanda: there is also some loop invariant part of UCT than you can pull out of the loop for nice performance gains
 michaellan: :o
 jacek: no one likes logarithms&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Peterpanda said it more technically than me&#160;:)
 michaellan: oh the log(parent.visits)
 eulerscheZahl: or squareroots
 Astrobytes: fastsqrtf
 jacek: sqrt is cheap
 eulerscheZahl: or inverse squareroots
 Astrobytes: fastinvsqrt
 michaellan: wait the log(parent.visits) is the only extractable part, no?
 jacek: quake3 invsqrt?
 jacek: yes
 michaellan: this is gonna make my code so ugly
 jacek: or sqrt(1/n) but thats too much imo
 eulerscheZahl: those legendary quake lines
 michaellan: i heard someone talking about a C4 multiplayer but i couldnt find it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4</a>
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: there's a search bar at the top of the site. use it
 jacek: did you find the memes yet
 michaellan: i am stupid
 Astrobytes: inline float fastlogf(const float&amp; x) { union { float f; uint32_t i; } vx = { x }; float y = vx.i; y *= 8.2629582881927490e-8f; return(y - 87.989971088f); }inline float fastsqrtf(const float&amp; x) { union { int i; float x; }u; u.x = x; u.i = (1 &lt;&lt; 29) + (u.i &gt;&gt; 1) - (1 &lt;&lt; 22); return(u.x); }inline float rsqrt_fast(float x) { return _mm_cvtss_f32(_mm_rsqrt_ss(_mm_set_ss(x))); }

 eulerscheZahl: still looks like glibberish that somehow compiles to me
 Astrobytes: Yes. It's fast as hell though.
 michaellan: should i use it in MCTS?
 Astrobytes: From my Smits collection&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should try it too
 Peterpanda: according to my profiling the sqrt(log()) line still eats up 9% of total time
 eulerscheZahl: _mm_rsqrt_ss
 eulerscheZahl: what includes do i need?
 Astrobytes: I think x86intrin.h
 jacek: i stopped caring about mcts/sim that much, since NN takes moslty over 90% time
 michaellan: for NN, do you create a new NN each run?
 michaellan: or do you somehow precompute it
 eulerscheZahl: offline training
 eulerscheZahl: many hours
 jacek: NN is just set of weights, trained offline
 michaellan: i see
 michaellan: do you use a cluster or your own computer
 michaellan: hmm, i'm wondering if i should switch from doubles to floats for my UCB calculation
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/189e81be-002a-4e83-95c5-62baeeeca194">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/189e81be-002a-4e83-95c5-62baeeeca194</a>
 jacek: i always use floats
 jacek: i use my pc only, those NNs are small
 eulerscheZahl: would be easier to compare speeds if there weren't so many different machines in the backend
 Astrobytes: Yes. Rather annoying.
 Astrobytes: xxd: the last pastebin is a more efficient UCB calculation
 Astrobytes: with some bits missing
 eulerscheZahl: that double invsqrt...took me a bit to realize what's going on here
 eulerscheZahl: you avoid a division
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i'll totally steal that
 Astrobytes: Got this from Smits, it's a good one
 jacek: no divide and conquer?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i won't steal that extra parenthesis 
 eulerscheZahl: bedtime, see you
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 jacek: :older_man:
 michaellan: thanks astro
 michaellan: what headeres do i need
 michaellan: and should i have AVX enabled
 Astrobytes: yeah, x86intrin.h, enable avx in pragmas
 Astrobytes: or whatever one it comes from, I forget
 martinpapa69: hmm i found out my solver was an anti-solver
 martinpapa69: an evil solver
 Astrobytes: sign error?
 martinpapa69: yup
 martinpapa69: classic
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Astrobytes: Welcome to MCTS solver debugging

 Peterpanda: hey astrobytes, can it be that log and sqrt are swapped in the code snippet you posted earlier? it doesnt match the UTC formula and is also making my bot play worse
 Peterpanda: although it weirdly computes twice as fast, and looking at the plots for ln(sqrt(x)) vs sqrt(ln(x)) i would just need to change C
 Westicles: Never trust free code from devious europeans
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you may be correct there D:
 Peterpanda: i have a feeling it might be intentional
 Peterpanda: fastsqrtf(fastlogf(node.visitCount)) computes twice as fast as  fastlogf(fastsqrtf(node.visitCount)) by some compiler black magic
 Peterpanda: (other way around)
 Astrobytes: No, seems correct if you follow the rearranged formula, to me at least
 Astrobytes: I could be wrong, it's late&#160;:/
 Peterpanda: in UCT you first take the log, then the sqrt, right?
 Westicles: If it was log(sqrt) you wouldn't need the sqrt, so yes
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Peterpanda: the code computes log(sqrt)
 Peterpanda: which should be log()/2&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hey this was a copy paste from my textfile snippet collection, didn't check my code&#160;:)
 Peterpanda: and the compiler is smart enough to somehow figure out that replacement :o
 Peterpanda: no criticism, i'm just trying to understand
 Westicles: That formula wasn't derived, just made up by somebody who might be a crazy person.  Use whatever gives you the best results
 Astrobytes: It is something of a black art playing around with that formula as applied to trees
 michaellan: is it too much for the right version now
 michaellan: i will try figuring it out
 michaellan: the way in which the terms were rearranged is smart to be more efficient
 Astrobytes: fastsqrtf(fastlogf(n))
 Astrobytes: and yeah, avoiding the division is nice
 ANONYMOUS42: does adding fast to my function name make my code faster?
 Astrobytes: yeah /s
 Astrobytes: Anyway. Pick the brain of MSmits. He's far better than I&#160;:)
 shashj: hello

 michaellan: is it called UCB1 or UCT?
 michaellan: i see both

 michaellan: regret not getting into AI earlier
 Astrobytes: It's a superb way to get learning imo, some good puzzles too

 michaellan:         return std::numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::infinity();

 michaellan: i guess not
 michaellan: wait... is it faster to do wins*invsqrt*invsqrt than it is to do wins/visits
 michaellan: :thinking:
 Senbonzakura: How do I see my previous code clashes?

 michaellan: or search history
 michaellan: browser history*
 Wontonimo: oh, didn't think of that
 Senbonzakura: Yes, I can go back, to view from notifications but what if the history becomes too long.
 michaellan: its not worthwhile
 michaellan: they're just clashes
 Wontonimo: yeah, move on with your life
 michaellan: what i hate more is you can see the corresponding chatroom for the clash, if you refresh the page

 Wontonimo: well, there is this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 Wontonimo: which is considered "the starter" multi player game
 michaellan: yeah, i hate it though its so hard
 michaellan: (for me)
 michaellan: YMMV
 Wontonimo: if you want a puzzle, i really liked physics problems and so I'd recommend the Mars Lander series (turn off volume for this) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 Wontonimo: if you want some hint for either Senbonzakura, send me a message
 Senbonzakura: Thankyou very much. I hit the link and was stuck a bit so pardon my late reply.
 Wontonimo: I'll dock you 3 fake internet points for the tardiness 
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Senbonzakura: Is that a good or bad thing? 
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/7Dp8qwQ">https://imgur.com/gallery/7Dp8qwQ</a>
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo is the new good-natured and helpful MK
 Astrobytes: Wear the taco mantle and wear it proudly!&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: :D
 Senbonzakura: I'll give you +10 internet points. I'm trying out the links you've given. INTERESTING&#160;:))
 michaellan: I am confuseed
 michaellan: where is rsqrt_fast() and fastlogf() located?
 jmurphy1267: I think this is just asking for the min number
 michaellan: doesnt seem to be in x86intrin
 michaellan: .h
 Astrobytes: lol
 michaellan:&#160;;-;

 michaellan: i'm actually stupid
 michaellan: thank you
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 michaellan: i cant believe i didnt connect the two dots
 michaellan: i sorta just deleted the first page since i had 0 clue what was happening and it was making my head hurt :rofl:
 michaellan: should i credit you for that code?
 michaellan: ouch i segfault :cry:
 Astrobytes: No, MSmits and whoever else he got that from
 Astrobytes: Got all your pragmas?
 michaellan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://envs.sh/OS.bin">https://envs.sh/OS.bin</a>
 michaellan: my headers
 michaellan: wow that pastebin is actually dumb, one sec

 michaellan: i took this from wontonimo
 michaellan: (the first two lines)
 Wontonimo: i was not responsible for the rest of that include all
 michaellan: heh
 michaellan: i can remove a couple now that i've opted for lower-level not-STL approaches
 Astrobytes: #undef _GLIBCXX_DEBUG 
 Astrobytes: ffs
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'd be interested if there is something better for the first 2 lines
 michaellan: yikesssss

 michaellan: march=native i saw that in a couple places online
 Astrobytes: I think that covers most bases, but don't always use Ofast
 michaellan: frik still getting segfault
 michaellan: and i dont know what to do now
 michaellan: :cry:
 michaellan: i will put a bunch of print statements to see at what point it segfaults
 Astrobytes: Turn off the pragmas
 michaellan: ah my UCT Is getting me NaN
 michaellan: wait... whats log(0)
 michaellan: i think thats the problem
 michaellan: wait, how did my program work before???
 michaellan: dont we always do log(0) when the parent node has 0 visits
 michaellan: wait i am just rambling
 Wontonimo: log(0) is undefined
 Wontonimo: or neg infinity if it is log(+0)
 Astrobytes: log(0) will get you far. Far from results
 michaellan:     if (n-&gt;visits == 0) {
 michaellan:         return std::numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::infinity();
 michaellan:     }
 michaellan: yeah that seems to fix it
 michaellan: arghhh this is so annoying
 michaellan: i am indecisive on how to generate a random move for UTTT
 michaellan: i'm wondering if i should cave in and use a std::vector of up to length 81
 michaellan: or.... i wonder if CG supports the int128s?
 KiwiTae: u need to rnd a valid move no? 
 michaellan: yeah but the worst case is 81 valid moves to choose from
 michaellan: which doesnt fit in 64 bit int
 KiwiTae: use 2 of them
 michaellan: that sounds like hell NGL
 michaellan: do you do that?
 KiwiTae: no i havent
 KiwiTae: didnt try uttt yet
 AllYourTrees: rust supports u128's :D
 michaellan: me no like rust
 michaellan: but i wonder how fast operations on u128s are
 AllYourTrees: :shrug: i think llvm does something with it
 AllYourTrees: it might be possible for rust to avx it automatically, but i don't think they compile it with the right flags
 Peterpanda: xxd choose random subboard first then random move on that board
 Peterpanda: it's not perfectly uniform but much easier to implement
 dsfjkfdls: sus
 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 Bevan_Boss: hi
 shashj: Hello everyone
 shashj: How are you guys improving your coding skills
 juice0: by playing games and taking a break every now and then to play other games, interspersing that with empty promises to read something every now and then
 Wontonimo: code every day shashj
 martinpapa69: code c every day:four_leaf_clover:
 Wontonimo: code more than you read non-code text every day
 BlueArtemis: write code like your life depends on it
 shashj: Thanks everyone
 Srinath_Mikaelson: hlooo

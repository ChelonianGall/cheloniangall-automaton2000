 DanielBikkr: good morning
 Goldwave: in what language? @DanielBikkr
 DanielBikkr: C#
 DanielBikkr: console.writeline break the program
 DanielBikkr: break*
 Goldwave: Console.WriteLine(var)
 Goldwave: then idk
 Goldwave: sorry
 DanielBikkr: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 DanielBikkr: no problem Gold wave, thx for the reply
 DanielBikkr: appreciate it
 Goldwave: Np :D
 Goldwave: There should be other alternatives, try google :D

 Unkmar: DanielBikkr: use standard error.  stderr or something like that in C.
 Uljahn: To debug: Console.Error.WriteLine("Debug messages...");
 Uljahn: should be in the commented lines in the stub
 Rodrigo_the_coder: fprintf(stderr, "Debug messages...\n");
 Rodrigo_the_coder: in C
 Rodrigo_the_coder: language
 Rodrigo_the_coder: to debug.
 DanielBikkr: @Unkmar &amp; @Uljahn thank you need to search for it, sorry. I thought maybe it wasn't possible.
 DanielBikkr: Console.Error.Writeline.. works 
 DanielBikkr: :punch:

 ils: captcha is not working. Any suggestion?
 jacek: recaptcha is banned in china&#160;:?
 ils: I am not in China.
 jacek: hmm
 Joseph_Mother: china sucks man
 Joseph_Mother: authoritarians
 Joseph_Mother: theyre genociding the uyghurs
 DanielBikkr: they killing them uyghurs now?
 abcdefg_123:  there are more than 50 ethnic groups there, what
 abcdefg_123: is special with uyghurs
 DanielBikkr: Are the other ethnic groups also being put in camps and forced to change their ways? All I know is the Uyghurs (some kind of Islamic group) are being taken there.
 S3na: hey
 Nickkname: Oh, from what I know, Chinese government was giving away money for uyghurs to live. 
 Nickkname: and seemed turykey government has arranged several polictical war trying to split uyghurs and other chinese cause they are at the edge area of China
 darkhorse64: Don't read propaganda
 DanielBikkr: good to know
 Nickkname: all those stuff are pretty much arrange by media
 Nickkname: It's hard to say which is propaganda
 darkhorse64: There ample testimonials from uyghurs from what is really happening. There is absolutely no doubt
 darkhorse64: *There are*
 Nickkname: ok, I'm out
 Nickkname: not really into politicals
 Nickkname: what you said could be true 
 S3na: blah blah blah everyone hates turks everyone said we do all bad things but we didn't kill 5 billion jewish
 S3na: just for fun
 S3na: ...
 darkhorse64: godwin point reached&#160;!
 Nickkname: Sorry for the Turks thing, I was just reading it from a news
 S3na: no problem, still the world thinks we are riding camels.But there is no such thing in our culture.
 S3na: our every turks are muslim etc.
 S3na: We only have a problem of expressing our political opinions.Because of the last president except that  we don't have much a difference
 Batfly: Whatever, the problem is rarely the peoples in general, but more the fem ones with powers (and I don't any any legitimate ones, even with elections....).
 Batfly: *few ones
 Batfly: *any have

 Thecodekid123: Are you confused with what i said 
 elderlybeginner: is there a thread/post about insides of CG? Size of servers, technology, amount of data, hardware?
 AntiSquid: what programs do you want to make Thecodekid123?
 Thecodekid123: what flooding?
 AntiSquid: no, but you are confused with what i said .
 AntiSquid: don't flood emotes in chat .
 Thecodekid123: what is that?
 2ndwolf: the crying smiley was an emote, don't send multiples times the same emote, one is enough
 AntiSquid: we talked in DM, all good now
 Thecodekid123: yeah :D no more emotes
 Thecodekid123: i promise that was not ment to be an emote
 Thecodekid123: what is DM?
 Thecodekid123: I told you i am a noob

 Thecodekid123: what is it
 eulerscheZahl: can we just add a regular expression to Automaton2000 to tell users not to share their clash invites here?
 Automaton2000: and we can't really use them
 eulerscheZahl: @Magus :angel:
 Astrobytes: That would be really useful

 AntiSquid: you can't trust the others, so only ask me
 Thecodekid123: so
 Thecodekid123: idc
 Magus: eulerscheZahl: Well, Automaton2000 is opensource, but i think Codingame does not want a not-cg-bot talking about moderations/rules 
 Automaton2000: i don't think it's too much for the help
 eulerscheZahl: ok, then you won't see a pull request
 AntiSquid: listen to Automaton2000, he makes a good point
 Automaton2000: so i need to check the referee
 Thecodekid123: eulerscheZahl  i think he is the best mod ever
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000&#160;?

 Thecodekid123: will yall ban me?
 Automaton2000: madknight did you see that
 AntiSquid: do you want the ban Thecodekid123&#160;?
 Thecodekid123: what Automation2000
 Magus: Automaton2000 is a just a plain old C++ command line program running behind a NodeJS XMPP client :D
 Automaton2000: hi new to this site than clashes :o
 Thecodekid123: oh
 Thecodekid123: he a robot then
 AntiSquid: are you sure? sounds as smart as a clasher to me 
 Thecodekid123: i knew robots would take over Earth
 Thecodekid123: what a clasher
 TurboM: what a unit
 Magus: it's funny, i didn't remember that i have a "blacklist" variable in Automaton2000. No one made a pull request to change it to "outlist" or whatever we have to call it now.
 Automaton2000: i dont know if i should start working on it
 Magus: Nope, you don't rewrite your own code. We already argued on it. I don't want a Skynet child.
 Thecodekid123: plz ban me now
 AntiSquid: your wish is my command
 eulerscheZahl: he didn't even see your last line&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: wait, is blacklist a racial discrimination now?
 TurboM: im confused
 AntiSquid: about your alt?
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: yes, blacklist and whitelist are not so great

 AntiSquid: i am wondering if you can call black people black anymore 
 eulerscheZahl: can i still call a power outage a blackout?
 AntiSquid: had a conversation with a black guy actually just about this, he said "hey i am calling that guy black because he is black, no idea what the fuss is all about"
 AntiSquid: the only real discrimination imo is to not acknowledge mixed people . everyone just talks about black vs white, everyone else is swept under the rug ...
 Uljahn: how do they call Black Fridays and black holes now?
 2ndwolf: I think blacklist would be considered discriminating because it has a negative meaning
 Astrobytes: When did anyone say you can't call black people black? All my black friends (African and Caribbean) refer to themselves and identify as black people
 Astrobytes: 2ndwolf: correct
 AntiSquid: being overly sensitive has negative implications
 Astrobytes: blackout is fine afaik, as well as brownout. I may be wrong
 AntiSquid: imo don't mix unrelated things is best
 DomiKo: in my country, we have cake named "cycki murzynki", which is a little bit less aggressive version of "nigger's boobs"
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: Can you *** out that word in future please
 jacek: ban
 DomiKo: I thought that would be auto ***
 DomiKo: there is no ***???
 Astrobytes: there is no filter on the chat no
 jacek: that works only with password
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/P9PcGzu.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/P9PcGzu.jpg</a>
 DomiKo: so my bad
 DomiKo: -10 points for gryffindor
 Astrobytes: Just hope Automaton doesn't choose to say that one
 jacek: Automaton2000 or AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: Upperclasses*
 Automaton2000: so it is better than you
 DomiKo: AutomatonNN can you say Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: try it and see what they do with the game to be a hard one
 AutomatonNN: hey air
 eulerscheZahl: -10 for Griffindor?you seem more like Hufflepuf :P
 Hjax: oh i see we were talking about the censoring of the word master everywhere 
 eulerscheZahl: i'll go shopping with my leader card then
 Hjax: im yet to find a person of color to who actually offended by things like that, it always seems to be that people get offended on the behalf of people who dont care either way
 Hjax: seems like we are fixing non-problems so we can feel good about being progressive, while ignoring the real problems 
 DomiKo: there are real problems?
 Astrobytes: "cancel culture" yeah. Divert from the real issues
 Astrobytes: Ban a word and clear your conscience of racial profiling, murder, discrimination, hate crimes
 Hjax: and yet those things continue, unimpeded, without the word 
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Hjax: the thing that stuck out to me recently was accounts of people getting resumes rejected, and then submitting a resume with a more white sounding name
 Hjax: and getting an interview
 DomiKo: there are some problems with interviews
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I worked under a chef like that once. Threw out any CV that didn't have an "English sounding" name
 DomiKo: like interviews only for women
 AntiSquid: yes Hjax . people get offended on behalf of others
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/sep/26/uk-barrister-mistaken-for-defendant-calls-for-compulsory-anti-racism-training">https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/sep/26/uk-barrister-mistaken-for-defendant-calls-for-compulsory-anti-racism-training</a>
 Hjax: this was also a super interesting example recently 
 Hjax: a lawyer getting mistaken for a defendant over and over because of her race 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I read that the other day
 Hjax: thats the kind of thing i hadnt even considered happening, reading her account of it really changes your perspective 
 AntiSquid: so if they find the defendant guilty they arrest the lawyer or what? lawyer then shouts i am not the defendant and they reply "don't resist arrest!"
 Astrobytes: People used to think the UK was really progressive, and it was getting somewhere, but we're back to 70s era racism again.
 Hjax: USA too 
 AntiSquid: is that really a case of racism (the lawyer thingy) or just plain stupidity? i mean come on you got to be dense to make that mistake
 Hjax: 3 different people racially profiled her to be a criminal 
 Hjax: in the same day 
 Astrobytes: Of course it's racist, it's negative stereotyping
 AntiSquid: so 3 stupid people she met with in the same day
 Hjax: i dont think how smart the people are affects how awful it is to racially profile someone like that 
 eulerscheZahl: but it shows a problem in the society
 eulerscheZahl: in this case it's clear that she's innocent
 eulerscheZahl: but imagine a crime being committed and searching for a suspect
 AntiSquid: well it shows the wrong people are hired in the legal system .
 AntiSquid: and that is worrying for everyone 
 Hjax: the lawyer is just calling for better racism training for employees in the legal system 
 Hjax: which i think is reasonable 
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/785eda7f-e3c4-4484-91dd-e9314f016c40">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/785eda7f-e3c4-4484-91dd-e9314f016c40</a>
 Hjax: racism is largely born of ignorance 
 AntiSquid: i rather them filter out people that shouldn't be working there
 Hjax: Astrobytes it reminds me of selfies people post on twitter, middle eastern looking man with the caption "time to get *randomly* searched at the airport!"
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Exactly right. Total joke. And don't get me started on stop and search.
 Hjax: there was a post on TIFU on reddit a while ago from one of the biggest redditors 
 Hjax: i think hes from Lebanon? anyway he was on a flight to a business meeting and went into the bathroom to shave quickly since he didnt have time before his flight
 Hjax: and the crew thought he was hijacking the plane and panicked 
 AntiSquid: imo reddit upvote economics is rotten in its own way
 Astrobytes: Classic "Fear of brown person" there Hjax
 Hjax: yeah
 2ndwolf: wooh lvl10
 Astrobytes: grats 2ndwolf

 Astrobytes: Greek/Lebanese with a beard. My sisters fiancé is Greek-Cypriot, he has a big bushy beard, moved up from London to Scotland and the amount of racism he experiences is unreal. "Arab terrorist" "bomberman" "cloth head" etc. etc. he's like WTF I'm Greek!

 Astrobytes: That poor dude, what an experience
 Astrobytes: I remember that one euler
 Hjax: oooooooo math 
 Hjax: so scary 
 AntiSquid: ya lots of europeans can easily get a strong tan 
 Astrobytes: Absolutely.
 Hjax: i know the USA was racist against italian americans for a while, which is like half of my family tree
 Schwase: does anyone know why my stub generator for OCaml has an "End_of_file" exception?
 Astrobytes: Schwase: It's the code that's generated I believe, even if stub is correct. See this post:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-dungeons-and-maps/185975/3">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-dungeons-and-maps/185975/3</a>
 Astrobytes: *thread not post
 AntiSquid: imo anti-irish sentiment was one of the weirdest things to read about
 Hjax: for a country that championed itself on being a melting pot, theres been a lot of racism against migrant groups here
 Astrobytes: Anti-Irish was common when I was growing up, The Troubles were ongoing, IRA bombs and whatnot. Was terrible what some of my friends and neighbours experienced. 
 Hjax: people forget that their own great grand parents were probably immigrants to the USA 
 Astrobytes: Now it's the Muslims who get it in the neck.
 Astrobytes: Minority of the moment and all that
 Schwase: Astrobytes i have more information on why the issue occurred, I think that multi-embedded loop commands are the cause of the issue since it was resolved by changing a two-command loop argument to a 1 command string/readLine command
 Scarfield: South Park has a pretty cool episode where people (goo-backs) time travel back from the future. There is only one race, because of "mixed" genes. But even if that happens IRL one day, people would still find other things to hate about each other
 Schwase: can i reported this somehow?
 Schwase: hey my aunt got a peabody for working on south park
 Schwase: haha
 AntiSquid: yes Hjax but there is also the other extreme of "let everyone in" even undocumented 
 Schwase: *can i report this somehow
 Scarfield: nice xD
 Astrobytes: Ah interesting, sure, either on Discord or make a forum post Schwase
 Hjax: sure AntiSquid, but the people that make a fuss often cant tell the difference between legal immigrants and illegal ones
 Astrobytes: ^
 Hjax: and just assume everyone of a race they dont like is an illegal immigrant 
 JFB: AntiSquid - what you have against squids?&#160;;-)
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/t75V7oe">https://imgur.com/gallery/t75V7oe</a>

 Astrobytes: argh, another Friendship is Tragic pony reference
 Hjax: reminds me of the starbelly sneetches
 Astrobytes: Power, exploitation, ignorance, fear of "the other"
 Astrobytes: sneetches, that was the Dr Seuss one right?
 Hjax: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just like that
 Hjax: that story has always fascinated me, because its a really accurate political commentary 
 Hjax: in a childrens picture book 
 Astrobytes: Yep. Kids are really open to these things too. Racism is passed down through parents mostly

 Scarfield: if a film/sheet could be made with only 1 molecole thickness, would it technically only have one surface?
 AntiSquid: even better link them your puzzles :p eulerscheZahl
 Schwase: scarfield no
 Schwase: you can look into lead microfibers
 AntiSquid: say you clash when they solve Space Maze
 Schwase: they are still physically bounded
 AntiSquid: could even put it in your profile 
 eulerscheZahl: oh no, that one guy trying to solve it was painful enough
 Schwase: only topology currently has any sort of theory on single surface objects
 Schwase: but they are topological discussions :D
 Schwase: so at your own risk as they say
 eulerscheZahl: g-rom mentioned that our puzzle contributions might appear on our profile in the future
 eulerscheZahl: along with the playgrounds
 Insufficient: mobius strip came to mind there
 AntiSquid: oh so encouragement to spam clash problems?
 AntiSquid: "i have 99 clashes, give me the job"
 eulerscheZahl: 99 bottles of clash on the wall
 Scarfield: yea but it would still have 2 sides, but technically to have 2 surfaces, i would guess there would have to be something in between for it not  being just one surface
 AntiSquid: add a tease to the strip

 eulerscheZahl: i'll still intend to play
 eulerscheZahl: on oct 8th
 AntiSquid: i watched their youtube vids, they said something about a problem related to asymmetric and symmetric encryption
 eulerscheZahl: that's not surprising
 AntiSquid: no, it's a hint
 eulerscheZahl: symmetric for the easy ones (xor or alike)maybe RSA for the later ones
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see that as a hint or spoiler, it's what I would have expected
 eulerscheZahl: btw the penguin game is now officially pending
 jacek: eeyup
 eulerscheZahl: that's your job jacek
 jacek: maybe simple floodfill will suffice
 Astrobytes: Grrr. No time til next week.

 darkhorse64: We are more than two. We are legion

 eulerscheZahl: in D?
 eulerscheZahl: of course, stupid question

 Astrobytes: with random windows with random numbers?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can they get IP info thru this?

 eulerscheZahl: and a 2nd world channel

 <b>**eulerscheZahl doesn't know your IP PatrickMcGinnisII</b></p><p><img src="/a/50843460987001" /> 2ndwolf: sometimes I get flooded with tabs after entering clashes

 PatrickMcGinnisII: I also had a nvidea share process go bad on me ... someone trying to hit my card?
 Astrobytes: One should open for each clash 2ndwolf, you can close it if you don't need it
 AntiSquid: rand number tab
 Astrobytes: Seems connected to PMs from external clients AntiSquid, not sure. Reported it yesterday anyway

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well, Discord is rampant with new injections, cookie snatchers
 eehh: im knew my dad wants me to make a game 
 eehh: butt i dont know python

 Flat_Erick: but still my rank is wood 34
 Flat_Erick: Im rank 1 of wood 3
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Flat_Erick wait a few hours
 Flat_Erick: Thanks, I actually got promoted few minutes ago&#160;;)
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Which one is this?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: arccos(1-d/2r^2)
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: How do get arccos in python?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Math.arccos&#160;?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: nvm got it
 AbdulrahmanHatim: Hiya everyone
 e1213: こにちは
 MadKnight: inichiwa&#160;?
 MadKnight: or wait, maybe konichiwa?
 MadKnight: would make more sense
 e1213: konichiwa
 MadKnight: oh and what would be the i symbol?
 DaNinja: い
 MadKnight: right
 MadKnight: everyone learned japanese, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah it's a bit confusing
 e1213: jajaj
 MadKnight: we gotta catch up with everyone Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i have to check if it is in the right direction
 MadKnight: we gotta find a japanese companion Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but if there are two ways to get to gold
 MadKnight: DaNinja u wanna speak some jap?
 e1213: いいえ
 MadKnight: iie/
 MadKnight:&#160;?
 MadKnight: is that no or yes
 e1213: iie = no
 MadKnight: right
 MadKnight: was kinda confusng since no sounds kinda like yes and yes - like no
 MadKnight: if everyone asks Automaton2000, will he stop no from sounding like yes?
 Automaton2000: what do you mean by that
 MadKnight: if everyone asks AutomatonNN, will he stop Automaton2000 from sounding like AutomatonNN&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is that how you got to do with them
 AutomatonNN: gonna be a moderator
 e1213: なに
 MadKnight: hmm first one looks like ka
 MadKnight: or na
 e1213: な = na
 MadKnight: is that nani&#160;?
 e1213: yes
 MadKnight: that's a reference to an old meme
 e1213: not so old
 MadKnight: things get old pretty fast
 e1213: :O
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is a bot, he generates random messages
 Automaton2000: did you see the result
 e1213: that's true?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 say Yes
 Automaton2000: go fix it and get a new one
 e1213: :O
 MadKnight: there's even a puzzle - Create your own Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: did you do to get out of the box
 MadKnight: and there's github repo with Automaton2000 sources
 Automaton2000: do you update thor's position
 MadKnight: and AutomatonNN is a neural network that generates responses
 AutomatonNN: what are you trying to do?
 e1213: :O:O
 e1213: :o
 MadKnight: and there is a few NN bots at the top of leaderboard of that racing game with pods
 JackTheRipper18: I'm on wood 1 on the pod racing game my thing beats the boss thing everytime how tf do I advance?
 MadKnight: submit and get #1
 JackTheRipper18: where do you submit?
 MadKnight: Submit button
 JackTheRipper18: I don't see that..
 JackTheRipper18: play code, replay in same conditions, or test in arena.
 MadKnight: gimme screenie
 JackTheRipper18: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gyazo.com/ff7c1c27e6a57898b6ea231c7768277c">https://gyazo.com/ff7c1c27e6a57898b6ea231c7768277c</a>
 MadKnight: yea last one is the one
 JackTheRipper18: test in arena?
 JackTheRipper18: I did that.
 MadKnight: it says u got rank 1k446
 JackTheRipper18: 1201 now but yeah?
 JackTheRipper18: Oh do you have to get first
 JackTheRipper18: ahh I get it.
 MadKnight: just use the boost
 JackTheRipper18: I am.
 JackTheRipper18: just a basic ass check if distance is high, and if it is boost.
 MadKnight: and the angle?
 JackTheRipper18: if &gt; 90 it does 20 thrust.
 MadKnight: if not facing the opposite dir? then boost?
 MadKnight: angle can be negative
 MadKnight: -167
 JackTheRipper18: if nextCheckPoint&gt;90 it does, 0 else if distance is high it boosts.
 JackTheRipper18: so essentially yes.
 JackTheRipper18: nextCheckpointAngle**
 MadKnight: -167&gt;90 won't work
 JackTheRipper18: oh they can be -
 JackTheRipper18: I'll just do angle math.abs then
 JackTheRipper18: it performs the same.
 JackTheRipper18: weird
 MadKnight: show me the new code
 JackTheRipper18: essentially the same, just std::abs(nextCheckpointAngle)
 MadKnight: still
 MadKnight: show it
 JackTheRipper18: alright I just won, did a quick change
 MadKnight: nice
 JackTheRipper18: realized smthn I was forgetting to do.
 arsh123: hlo
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I have a question
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I need to find the length between 2 points on a circle, following the arc formed
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: But the equations I'm using don't seem to work
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/830413/calculating-the-arc-length-of-a-circle-segment">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/830413/calculating-the-arc-length-of-a-circle-segment</a>
 2ndwolf: I'm guessing if you have the radius, you could do from the angle created from forming a triangle with one of its sides being the shortest path between the two point.From the angle, being a fraction of 360 you could get the same fraction of the circumference.
 2ndwolf: I know nothing about these things but from the top of my head I'd try that.
 2ndwolf: oh sorry that's what the answer says XD
 2ndwolf: can't help then I figured you'd look up the details

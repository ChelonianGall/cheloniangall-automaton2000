 WINWINWIN: :D well done
 Kinlei: what is leaderboard based on
 Kinlei: your level?
 ZarthaxX: nop
 ZarthaxX: contest and multiplayers 
 Piegusek: Siemka 
 Uljahn: what is leaderboard, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: im going to give it some more
 v.i.r.a.g.o: Hey! a newbie here.

 WINWINWIN: I think that this is an English channel, your country chat is for native language
 eulerscheZahl: or a 2nd English channel in your case WINWINWIN
 DaNinja: hi Euler, does Submit work for you in Space Jam Episode 2?
 DaNinja: I just get Loading...
 eulerscheZahl: there are no validators, just public testcases
 eulerscheZahl: i never finished the game&#160;:(
 DaNinja: thats a pity, I enjoyed it!&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: do you pass all public testcases?
 DaNinja: yes for Space Jam
 DaNinja: still cant get all of them for Space Maze
 Astrobytes: Wasn't episode 2 supposed to be harder?
 eulerscheZahl: i can solve episode 1. for the 2nd part I fail the testcase with many cars that have to reach the center
 eulerscheZahl: initially i planned episode 1 in the hard section and episode 2 (with multiple cars) in very hard
 Imsure1200q: whats that
 eulerscheZahl: btw how did you even find the 2nd part?
 Astrobytes: Other people bookmark contributions too euler&#160;;)
 DaNinja: I dont remember - I had the URL somewhere <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: hm, should i finish the 2nd part? :thinking:
 DaNinja: for sure!
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if unique enough or too close to part 1. other opinions?
 eulerscheZahl: or same opinions from other users
 pp704554: hiiii
 Astrobytes: Hopefully won't take so long to be validated this time!In my opinion, if it's sufficiently more difficult than part 1, it's fine.
 DaNinja: the multiple cars and platforms needing cars make it a slightlydifferenct challenge than par t1
 Astrobytes: Yes, that too.
 eulerscheZahl: i'll see that I get my own solution working and then draft some more testcases + validators i guess
 eulerscheZahl: after lunch
 Imsure1200q: whats this episode 1 and 2 thing
 Imsure1200q: and those validators it sounds like Vulkan is in codingame
 eulerscheZahl: episode 1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>episode 2: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6</a>
 Imsure1200q: thanks wil check
 eulerscheZahl: warning: it might look simple at first. it's not
 Imsure1200q: im dealing with a lot of hard problems (e.g. modeling humans down to every feature) but I guess I'll just survey and try the problem
 Imsure1200q: by modeling i mean using code to "make" the human / whatever animal and stuff. i'm waiting for my browser to load the link so ya
 Imsure1200q: woah its fun&#160;:) thanks a lot
 Brokolis: Have any companies contacted you through codingame?
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: no. whenever there is an option asking me to get contacted, i uncheck it
 WINWINWIN: :D, I have never been asked
 Astrobytes: I get asked all the time. Have to fight them off I get so many...
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: smits got asked repeatedly after competing in a sponsored contest
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even rank that high there
 Imsure1200q: will observing the cases alone be enough haha
 eulerscheZahl: 768MB
 Imsure1200q: thats good enough
 WINWINWIN: smits created his own algorithm and is a professional physics teacher, pretty sure that everyone would try to recruit him
 Astrobytes: Which contest was that?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know if recruiters checked that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/contests/amadeus-challenge/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/contests/amadeus-challenge/global</a>
 eulerscheZahl: smits at 69, not impressive at all
 Astrobytes: Oh I liked that contest. Just wish I'd been a bit more skilled at the time
 eulerscheZahl: they asked him if he would be willing to move to france. he said no, so they asked about England
 Astrobytes: I remember getting an email after it from Amadeus but not like that lol
 Astrobytes: lol, their main office is in Nice right?
 eulerscheZahl: and i just unchecked, so they didn't contact me
 eulerscheZahl: dunno
 WINWINWIN: Is numba available on python here?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Astrobytes: No, but you get numpy, pandas and scipy
 WINWINWIN: But can you use JIT on any of them?
 eulerscheZahl: guess who was faster Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: I wasn't even going to bother commenting&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :D
 WINWINWIN: I dont understand?
 WINWINWIN: faster, commenting?
 Astrobytes: euler usually beatts me with comments and urls
 Astrobytes: *beats
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: he has 5g righ
 Astrobytes: He's usually faster
 Astrobytes: He's quick off the mark
 Imsure1200q: has 5G
 eulerscheZahl: wire
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Imsure1200q: eulerschezahl idk if space maze is hard its not really
 Imsure1200q: but i might be underestimating tell me if i'm
 eulerscheZahl: you won't be able to enumerate all possible board states and just bruteforce it
 Imsure1200q: bruteforcing is so tiring
 Imsure1200q: who would i do that
 Imsure1200q: *why hah
 Imsure1200q: *i cant speel today
 eulerscheZahl: spell :P
 Astrobytes: Maybe he was trying to insert a little German to put you at ease, and misspelled 'spiel' :P
 Imsure1200q: i failed german&#160;:( lol
 Astrobytes: Well, there's our answer
 Imsure1200q: speel the tea eulertashechszal
 Imsure1200q: is hard for u or no?
 Astrobytes: wth is that
 karliso: How would do you call opening/middlegame/endgame in one word?
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d4ef1e9-8da5-4168-a15b-aa3e0efc5ca7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d4ef1e9-8da5-4168-a15b-aa3e0efc5ca7</a>
 Imsure1200q: what are you talking about&#160;: "speel the tea," "eulershzezhal" or the cgame
 Astrobytes: karliso - game?&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: game
 Astrobytes: Possible - GameStage
 Astrobytes: *Possibly 
 struct: stage sounds nice
 karliso: Yeah, I like stage too, thanks.
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: hi struct
 struct: hi astro
 Imsure1200q: PHaSE
 Astrobytes: phase also good yeah
 struct: I stopped shogi and moved to other game
 Astrobytes: Already? :D What now?
 Imsure1200q: stage/phase/level/step
 struct: no info for now :p
 Astrobytes: Dammit :P
 Imsure1200q: give upped
 struct: Name is close to shogi
 Astrobytes: shigo
 Astrobytes: Goshi
 Imsure1200q:&#160;:( is there inheritance in javascript
 struct: Game is quite recent
 Imsure1200q: sorry i learned javascript when i was like "little" child so my understanding is messed up and stuff
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q google objects and prototypes
 struct: Ill try to finish this one today
 struct: Seems like a fast game to make
 Astrobytes: 2 hours timer staaaaarts.... NOW. Gogogo
 struct: 2 hours is too short
 jacek: ultimate connect4
 Astrobytes: lol just kidding struct
 struct: Well there are 4 boards
 jacek: hmm actually would that work with 6 connect4 boards&#160;:?
 struct: Try it :p
 Imsure1200q: nvm dont need to inherit
 jacek: Astrobytes implementing prunearray for oware?
 Astrobytes: how did you guess?!
 olaf_surgut: someone know how to write edmonds/blossom algorithm?
 olaf_surgut: i need it for my school lessons
 olaf_surgut: pls help
 Astrobytes: lol, just playing around with some tweaks/'improvements' jacek. And giving myself timeouts ofc
 Astrobytes: And invalid actions when I reuse my nodes 
 struct: for multiple board is uttt notation good enough?
 privateschoolgirl: guess my job&#160;; )
 Astrobytes: Depends on the game I guess struct
 jacek: how can you write in chat when lvl 1
 jacek: :O
 struct: was wondering the same jacek
 struct: I guess astro
 eulerscheZahl: external client
 struct: Ill guess ill leave it like uttt
 Astrobytes: external client?
 Astrobytes: DAMN YOU euler
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: sorry&#160;:(
 struct: I dont think doing 1 0 0 1 14 4 5 5
 struct: first being indicating board and second doesnt
 Astrobytes: That looks like a Prune Array
 struct: should not matter much anyways
 struct: game is 4 boards and all fit in 64
 Imsure1200q: euler if a platform in space maze goes out of view will it be deleted or will it still be processed for collisions?
 struct: Well it says that platforms can move into orbit
 struct: But it also says the game is solvable without doing so
 struct: "The car gets lost in space by moves on a void cell or by sending a platform with the car on it into orbit"
 Imsure1200q: euler if i train a neural net to solve these cases is it counted as hardcoding or no
 Imsure1200q: cuz i might do it
 RoboStac: you don't have access to the validators, so you'd have to train it to solve unknown mazes
 Imsure1200q: whats validators?
 RoboStac: every puzzle has visible test cases and hidden validators
 RoboStac: to stop hardcoding
 Imsure1200q: i can use a genetic thing if that helps get it to global minimum. Also are validators like way harder puzzles
 Astrobytes: No, they're usually of a similar type to the test cases, but different
 RoboStac: no, they should be easier or similar difficulty to the visible tests. They're just unknown
 Imsure1200q: maybe ill try to make other cases but ill use the neural net as last resort ae
 Alshock: @Imsure1200q well it's not hardcoding if you train your nn on the test cases and it passes the validators
 RoboStac: it seems odd that you are starting with the hardest (least solved) puzzle
 Alshock: mind the overfitting if you have few puzzles though
 Imsure1200q: im starting with this one cuz the others are boring
 Astrobytes: ...
 Alshock: that's a good point, if you like this one better then go for it
 Alshock: if you have trouble solving it though, it could be a good idea to solve some easier ones first
 Imsure1200q: also everytime in interscholar competitions the hardest ones are the easiest for me, and vice versa&#160;:( anyway it just seems fun for me than "Counting pegs" or whatever that thor thing was.
 Astrobytes: You know there are multiplayer bot programming games too right? 
 Imsure1200q: wait not hardest competitions, i mean the hard/difficult round
 Imsure1200q: yeah but the multiplayer involves lots of stuff like physics and im too lazy to apply rn
 Astrobytes: Um, there's only a few physics-based multiplayer games
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Imsure1200q: oh well i guess im not into multiplayer anymore what happened to me
 Astrobytes: Board games, strategy/resource management, physics based, whatever
 Imsure1200q: im also confused with the monte carlo tree thing like no one explains it well
 Imsure1200q: so i guess its why i like the space maze
 jacek: uttt eh
 Astrobytes: Can you pathfind well/familiar with graph search algorithms in general like BFS/DFS? Are you familiar with minimax? GA, SA optimisation algos? Tell us what you're best with and we can recommend something
 jrke: hey is this ok in python 
 jrke: checkpointX[m]=x
 jrke: i m new to python
 Astrobytes: My 'prune array' is working now jacek
 Imsure1200q: not familiar with any of those
 Imsure1200q: all im familiar with is binary search and A*
 Imsure1200q: but im starting to forget A* cuz i never used it
 Astrobytes: Right. And you wanted to use machine learning for Space Maze.
 Imsure1200q: but with strategy im okay i guess, just depends on the problem
 Imsure1200q: For machine learning im also kinda okay with it
 Imsure1200q: gradient descent and all that doesnt overwhelm me anymore
 jacek: sounds mathy
 Imsure1200q: cuz it is mathy mathy
 Merde.png: Jrike, As long as checkpointX is a list and m is an index of an object you want to change to x
 Astrobytes: Any special improvements this time jacek?
 Astrobytes: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: damn timrouts
 Astrobytes: *timeouts
 Imsure1200q: flipdatable
 Imsure1200q: also can codingame fold comments cuz i overloaded the file with console.logs
 Astrobytes: Hover the mouse over the line numbers, click on the arrows that appear
 Imsure1200q: but it doesnt appear&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: its an if statement with braces but it doesnt collapse
 Astrobytes: works for me
 Imsure1200q: maybe i need for it to compile?
 Imsure1200q: i needed to indent it
 Imsure1200q: ok thats that
 eulerscheZahl: he asked about folding the error output of the code, not the code itself. you can't fold the output
 Astrobytes: No, he had loads of console.logs in the code and wanted to fold them
 Imsure1200q: ya i wanted to fold the console.logs
 Imsure1200q: cuz im listing the solutions to all the cases and then deving an alg for it but its so messy tho
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's the default behavior for the Monaco Editor which CG is using
 Imsure1200q: oh ok but its weird cuz all i need to collapse lines is to press tab
 Imsure1200q: and also click on the arrow and boom its collapse but if i dont tab then no collapse
 Astrobytes: You don't normally indent your code?
 Imsure1200q: i didnt indent my console.logs because there was no reason to. I just made a sequence of console.logs per case so i didnt indent the console.logs
 Imsure1200q: but sometimes in speedruning and obfuscating no indent but also when im sleepy
 Astrobytes: "sequence of console.logs per case" - surely you only need one for all cases?
 Imsure1200q: Right so now that I collapsed my lines codingame is not allowing me to press enter
 Imsure1200q: no cuz for one case there are multiple turns and one console.log per turn
 Imsure1200q: but instead of putting it in while loop, im hardcoding the solutions (for now)
 Astrobytes: Welp. That ain't gonna get you far.
 Astrobytes: Pathfinding is required for Space Maze. And you have to simulate the turns.
 Imsure1200q: well i guess its better than making non-educated guess how ur supposed to solve it
 Imsure1200q: yeah im gonna implement pathfinding later
 Astrobytes: It's in the tags: "Maze, Simulation Pathfinding"
 eulerscheZahl: the solution used to train the network i guess
 Imsure1200q: but what if you dont use common pathfinding algos but end up solving it?
 Imsure1200q: cuz sometimes i dont but i end up solving those types of challenges anyway
 eulerscheZahl: not the approach i had in mind when creating the puzzle. but when it might pass the validators: sure, go ahead and try it.
 eulerscheZahl: even if it turns out that your approach will fail (which i don't know), you can still learn from it
 Imsure1200q: also isnt A* like O(n!)&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: what is n here?
 Imsure1200q: or is it n^2
 eulerscheZahl: also: it heavily depends on your heuristic how many steps you need at A*
 Imsure1200q: n is how much squares in the grid
 eulerscheZahl: an upper limit would be n^(1+platformCount)
 Imsure1200q: lol i dont even think A* will work for the platforms
 Imsure1200q: woo thats so much
 Imsure1200q: but i guess actually solving the cases yourself helps so that you dont have to let the machine solve anything pointless
 Imsure1200q: like calculating the path of a floating platform even if its like not going to touch anything
 Imsure1200q: im telling my code that if it sees one of those blocks, pretend its a solid block except you can move it a bit
 Imsure1200q: And make use of all platforms that intersect the path of the main one
 Imsure1200q: so far it works
 Imsure1200q: Also if you see a platform that is impossible to move, turn it into a solid block
 Imsure1200q: Maybe i can do a mod of A* but not actual  A*
 Imsure1200q: idk tho i have 0 experience with this
 Astrobytes: I recommend redblobgames.com for all your pathfinding requirements
 Imsure1200q: will check it tomorrow thnx&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: is there such thing as a monte carlo pathfinding
 Astrobytes: Randomly wandering around?
 Imsure1200q: like picking random points seeing which path progressively reaches the target
 WINWINWIN: Im sure that even if it doesnt have a name, it would work
 WINWINWIN: but it will be far from perfect in a map with walls
 Astrobytes: Sure. Not sure a random walk will be massively effective here.
 Imsure1200q: its like going round the park 
 Imsure1200q: so tiring
 Astrobytes: Like most things, try it and see. You'll hopefully learn along the way.
 Imsure1200q: i can already see it failing
 Imsure1200q: like it picks a random point and the paths right there but it chose the local minimum
 Imsure1200q: not the global
 Astrobytes: Have you solved some of the easier puzzles? There are other ones related to pathfinding that might be better to practice on first
 Imsure1200q: idk i have this sense when im solving them like "why is it so unpleasing" idk why but it really interrupts my thinking
 Astrobytes: Some of them have graphics too
 Imsure1200q: idk maybe because i was younger then ill check 
 Astrobytes: But a lot of the puzzles just use textual representation
 Imsure1200q: those ones i dont like&#160;:
 Astrobytes: The official CG ones and some of the newer puzzles have graphics
 Astrobytes: I don't mind textual representation but the graphics are nice
 Imsure1200q: for me textual is tiring
 Imsure1200q: its like reading one of those papers and all i see is black and white
 Astrobytes: One of what papers?
 Imsure1200q: except here its like #30303F and white
 Astrobytes: One of which papers rathert
 Astrobytes: *rather
 Imsure1200q: like the papers you know like
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/forest-fire">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/forest-fire</a>that one is relatively easy and has nice graphics
 Imsure1200q: as simple as "finding a point in a triangle"
 Imsure1200q: i have to read 13 pages of calculus and stuff
 Imsure1200q: or linear algebra
 Astrobytes: You don't enjoy mathematics then?
 Imsure1200q: there are some people like Sebastian Lague who explain it so easily + graphics; thats the type of challenge in codin that i like
 Imsure1200q: I enjoy mathematics a lot but not reading it
 Imsure1200q: Its like enjoying how complex a classical music is but not enjoying trying to hear the notes from a music sheet
 Imsure1200q: like "what is that note?!" or "why does it have two clefs aaaa!!!!" see what i mean
 Astrobytes: So you enjoy the complexity of mathematics but you don't enjoy doing it? Seems counter-intuitive
 Imsure1200q: oh yeah euler im checking it out tomorrow also&#160;:) the link
 Imsure1200q: only thing i dont enjoy abt math is reading the formulas
 Astrobytes: That's half the fun. The other half is writing them.
 Imsure1200q: oops i meant "trying to hear the notes by reading the music sheet"
 struct: Wondering if I should make the board size dynamic :thinking:
 Imsure1200q: well i guess writing them is fun for you. But for me its so boring to read an equation.
 Imsure1200q: but yeah i guess writing it is sometimes fun
 Astrobytes: You're not finished yet? What is this tomfoolery? :P
 Astrobytes: struct
 struct: Im slacking&#160;:/
 Imsure1200q: oo mee too
 Uljahn: you need a deadline
 struct: Yes Uljahn
 struct: I must release 1 multi per week this month
 Astrobytes: Tried to give him a 2 hour one earlier Uljahn&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: You said you'll finish it today, would you like a specific deadline?
 struct: Ill finish the first version 
 struct: Not the stament and final graphics
 Imsure1200q: whats multi are you in a programming course or smth
 Astrobytes: Sure that's good enough struct
 struct: Imsure1200q <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 struct: Its games where you create an ai to fight other players ai
 Astrobytes: I showed him earlier
 Imsure1200q: making a multiplayer game?
 struct: im making one yes
 struct: I made 2 before
 Imsure1200q: so like its your job to do it
 Astrobytes: The community can make puzzles and multiplayer games (and clashes) Imsure1200q
 struct: no, I just do it for fun
 Imsure1200q: oh well.
 Imsure1200q: lol oh no a thought came to my mind
 Imsure1200q: forget what i said
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q, here are all the currently pending community submissions:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>
 Imsure1200q: about that like are we supposed to approve them?
 Imsure1200q: or its optional and we can leave it there
 Astrobytes: Test them, break them, give feedback. Once it's established that they are bug-free, then the approval process begins
 Astrobytes: It's optional, and you must be of a certain level (or have done x amount of clashes in those cases) to approve
 Astrobytes: *bug-free and if necessary, has a valid solution
 Imsure1200q: ok i wont do them yet
 Imsure1200q: is it possible add more than 1 file on puzzle
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl
 struct: no
 cegprakash: why u no do search race
 eulerscheZahl: it's just another CSB clone. i'm not a CSB fan
 cegprakash: hehe
 Astrobytes: *Addition to the CSB series&#160;;)
 cegprakash: but it's easy codingpoinnts
 struct: doesnt give much
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care about points
 Imsure1200q: good exampl++
 eulerscheZahl: it doesn#t look fun to me, so i don't do it
 Uljahn: the truth is we are scared of being rekt by ceg :smirk:
 cegprakash: doesn't care about points (says #1)
 Astrobytes: He doesn't *have* to care about points
 Astrobytes: lol Uljahn
 cegprakash: Uljahn truth 
 cegprakash: I like the fact that u agree
 cegprakash: thanks for the respect
 Uljahn: :muscle:
 Astrobytes: :prune:
 cegprakash: u dont like Paper soccer too eulerscheZahl
 Imsure1200q: i guess in space maze you can think of a taxidriver driving a car and dropping off at destination
 eulerscheZahl: that one looks interesting actually. just so much to do on CG
 struct: go Yavalath cegprakash
 cegprakash: you will love it we get 200 ms on it
 struct: top 1 ez
 cegprakash: bad thing is it has only 1 league and it takes some time to build a bot with valid moves
 struct: I would add a league to Yavalath, but I cant edit it&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I wonder why... :thinking:
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u say it's a clone to csb so u donn't want to do it
 cegprakash: even I hated to touch the old code I wrote 5 yrs back
 cegprakash: or probably 8 yrs back
 cegprakash: not sure
 Astrobytes: He didn't do BR either ceg, because he doesn't want to
 cegprakash: but I build a code from scratch for search race
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't tried CSB to seriously either
 cegprakash: now I can use this to improve my CSB
 eulerscheZahl: too*
 cegprakash: bitrunner I hates too
 struct: :D
 cegprakash: -4v doesn't work for bitrunner
 eulerscheZahl: never tried bitrunner
 eulerscheZahl: but i could easily promote to the highest league
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: you remember the story Astrobytes, right?
 Astrobytes: The Cat Remembers
 struct: I do
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 cegprakash: when _Royale beats eulerscheZahl then eulerscheZahl will think about doing BR
 cegprakash: they are only 1300 cp apart
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care about the global leaderboard
 cegprakash: we'll see
 cegprakash: :D
 struct: He could also do Yavalath
 eulerscheZahl: and i haven't done like 6 multiplayers
 struct: Gives quite a decent amount of points
 Astrobytes: Fix your Oware ceg
 cegprakash: oh nno eulerscheZahl doppred 4 ranks on Oware

 IamTheSmix: ultimat*
 cegprakash: yeah that's UTTT
 cegprakash: I've tried but I plan a stream after few weeks
 cegprakash: I need to try MCTS
 cegprakash: I've never used MCTS before
 IamTheSmix: Yeah 
 Astrobytes: You need an extra large PA for MCTS ceg
 IamTheSmix: I tried Negamx

 IamTheSmix: I had time out when I go beyong depth = 4
 struct: Which language?
 IamTheSmix: python
 cegprakash: minimax is only good when the goals are clear.. in UTTT there are lot of goals so it's kinda hard to do minimax
 cegprakash: and yes the moves are limited
 cegprakash: UTTT has just so many possible moves
 cegprakash: especially in early game
 IamTheSmix: yeah true, and also evaluation function is not obvious 
 Astrobytes: Still a few minimaxers in legend
 cegprakash: even depth 4 is impressive I would say :P 
 Astrobytes: Somehow
 cegprakash: Astrobytes probably small depth with some strategical pruning
 Astrobytes: well alphabeta is a given yeah, it's just the eval. I don't even want to think about attempting an eval for UTTT lol
 IamTheSmix: I tried to used variable depth 
 IamTheSmix: like in the begining only depth = 2
 IamTheSmix: and middle game depth = 4
 aCat: cegprakash start with flat monte carlo, and then extend into mcts
 aCat: flat mc is solid gold in UTTT
 cegprakash: without opponent prediction u mean aCat?
 eulerscheZahl: part of MC
 eulerscheZahl: just do rollouts. but not with MCTS weights, just fully random
 aCat: random simulations from the root
 IamTheSmix: I heard there is a hybdrid MCTS + Minimax
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS solver
 aCat: and take the top move with best average score
 Astrobytes: I need to implement the solver for my Oware 
 cegprakash: MCTS has a eval of 1 line right? if win return 1 else return -1
 IamTheSmix: I think you should also give reward for draw
 cegprakash: but if u want me to do MC then how can I go till end of the game?
 aCat: draw = 0&#160;?
 IamTheSmix: draw = 0.5
 IamTheSmix: I might say
 aCat: -1/0/1 or 0/0.5/1
 Uljahn: ^
 Astrobytes: -1 0 1, 0, 0.5, 1 same stuff
 IamTheSmix: 0/0.5/1
 aCat: cegprakash the same&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: ah cat beat this cat
 aCat: just random sim
 cegprakash: -1/0.5/1 looks safe
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 Uljahn: jeez
 Astrobytes: Kill me now Uljahn
 aCat: euler you are duing mcts solver for uttt instead of normal mcts?
 IamTheSmix: the problem is for MCTS in UTTT is how much iteration you can make in 100 ms 
 IamTheSmix: xD
 aCat: a lot
 IamTheSmix: tell me
 Uljahn: in python - not so much
 cegprakash: just 81 iterations I think
 cegprakash: we have 81 spaces in UTTT board right?
 Xcalibre: yep
 JJCA: good evening, maybe you can help me. When i had selected one language,... can i change it?
 ZarthaxX: no, you are locked for life
 cegprakash: so it's just 81-turn iterations with turn 0 indexed
 ZarthaxX: where JJCA?
 JJCA: i had chosen c# when asked what to practice
 aCat: IamTheSmix <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/469702268">https://www.codingame.com/replay/469702268</a>
 JJCA: but how can i change now to python for example?
 IamTheSmix: the state space you mean @ceg&#160;? 
 cegprakash: 81 depth IamTheSmix
 ZarthaxX: i dont know where you are talking about
 aCat: after @ number of sims
 Uljahn: there is a dropdown on the top of IDE, JJCA
 cegprakash: nno. of states is sooooo high why u care about that IamTheSmix
 eulerscheZahl: aCat 04:50PMeuler you are duing mcts solver for uttt instead of normal mcts?
 cegprakash: after aCat's idea MCTS looks so simple
 aCat: oh thx&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: Hi Zarthlander
 cegprakash: just full random 81 depth
 cegprakash: best move= the first move which gives high win rate
 aCat: and then you add tree part
 IamTheSmix: yeah for a simple rollout is 81 max iteration 
 aCat: it's flat MC without tree
 cegprakash: what tree part :o
 aCat: MCTS monte carlo tree search
 IamTheSmix: but to to choose the best move you shuold make a lot of iterations
 Astrobytes: The Tree Search part of MCTS perhaps ceg?
 aCat: what I told you is Flat Monte Carlo
 JJCA: Thank you @Uljahn
 cegprakash: okay so something to do with the weights 
 eulerscheZahl: the T in MCTS isn't for TicTacToe?
 cegprakash: will learn that later
 ZarthaxX: AstroLander heyo
 aCat: you have to make it to start MCTS, 
 IamTheSmix: I wonder how KArliso gets in RANK 1 UTTT
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl
 Uljahn: and substitute high winrate with UCB1 (UCT)
 aCat: eulerscheZahl I'm trying to share knowledge not disturbance and chaose :P
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl yes, it's montecarlo tictactoe search
 Astrobytes: Monte Carlo Train Set
 IamTheSmix: I started coding MCTS with python 
 IamTheSmix: I get only 100 iteration per/100ms
 eulerscheZahl: you will struggle to get a reasonable amount of simulations
 eulerscheZahl: yeah...
 Astrobytes: Good way to practice the algo, won't be fast enough for CG though
 IamTheSmix: and dropped in silver xD
 aCat: change language... it won't work
 eulerscheZahl: you need 20k rollouts for legend
 IamTheSmix: hmm
 IamTheSmix: I will first see if my code works fine in python and then code it in C++
 Uljahn: i have 500 in gold
 Uljahn: in python
 IamTheSmix: UTTT&#160;?
 Uljahn: ye
 struct: What I did for UTTT was first do TTT with bitboards and mcts and then ported it to UTTT
 IamTheSmix: maybe my code isn't optimized of has buggs
 struct: didnt take me long to port
 Uljahn: some inefficient numpy with bitboards
 IamTheSmix: bitboards&#160;? 
 Uljahn: also teccles moves
 IamTheSmix: what is that&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: the -3v of UTTT
 Alshock: a board of bits
 IamTheSmix: 3x3 you mean 
 IamTheSmix:&#160;?
 Alshock: @IamTheSmix -3v is a heuristic joke from CSB
 Alshock: the ultimate magic number
 IamTheSmix: I'm in this website xD I don't understant all SIGLES 
 IamTheSmix: ^^
 IamTheSmix: new*
 Alshock: Yeah I'm lost sometimes as well so I get revenge on people like me afterward :P CSB is Coders Strike Back ^^
 IamTheSmix: @ULjahn teccles moves&#160;? 
 IamTheSmix: CSB
 Uljahn: teccles move in uTTT is the move which sends your opponent to the same mini-board, but for the empty ones only
 IamTheSmix: xD
 IamTheSmix: @ULjahn ok got you 
 Uljahn: also we have tab completion for nicks here
 Alshock: Oh yes we do dear Ul&lt;TAB&gt; :D
 IamTheSmix: AIshock I live in palaiseau just near you ^^
 Alshock: and leojean is in Massy :P
 IamTheSmix: xD
 Alshock: we're a gang now
 IamTheSmix: haha
 IamTheSmix: thank you all for your help 
 IamTheSmix: I go back to code ^^
 Imsure1200q: haha eulerscheZahl

 Imsure1200q: how to make text bold in this chat
 Imsure1200q: **bold**
 Imsure1200q: *bold*
 eulerscheZahl: let me guess: it screws your heuristics?
 eulerscheZahl: there is no formatting here

 Imsure1200q: also why is circling the hardest and not the others
 Imsure1200q: or maybe im being stupid and the solutions right behind me
 Imsure1200q: all i know abt circling is that in every row there will be at least 2 blocks except 2nd row
 Imsure1200q: and that you need two LR platforms to guide the UDLR platform to the car
 eulerscheZahl: i try to reward moving as few platforms as possible
 Imsure1200q: nooo dont do that
 Astrobytes: You are expected to optimise your solution

 eulerscheZahl: only moving 3 out of 8 platforms
 Imsure1200q: so you used the two top ones and the UDLR one?
 Imsure1200q: cause i know they must be used
 eulerscheZahl: i just try to use as few as possible. i'm expanding other paths which use other platforms as well
 eulerscheZahl: but delay those involving more platforms for later

 Imsure1200q: also is threading allowed in codin
 Astrobytes: You can but there's no benefit.
 Imsure1200q: like i give my brain to the core and the core give me it back
 Imsure1200q: or i can use my graphics gard

 Imsure1200q: oh yeah is it possible to run CNN on codingame
 Imsure1200q: hi
 AntiSquid: if you keep it small and write it yourself&#160;? :p
 eulerscheZahl: you have to train offline and then submit it. you are limited to 100k chars and have to submit your own implementation as there are no NN libraries available on CG
 HotTraveller_646: Hello
 Astrobytes: I already explained this
 eulerscheZahl: oh, didn't read all the chat
 Imsure1200q: but like its a convo its different from a normal perceptron

 HotTraveller_646: hi, imsure
 AntiSquid: quite sure CNN take more space and time
 HotTraveller_646: I am new in codingame.
 Imsure1200q: just realized that its a normal one except its kinda like a "reverse-raster" and the inputs have weights
 HotTraveller_646: I solved one problem, And next What have I to do.
 AntiSquid: solve another one
 Astrobytes: Solve another
 Imsure1200q: There are plenty problems out there.
 AntiSquid: a never ending cycle of problem solving
 HotTraveller_646: If I solved all of them. What can I get.
 AntiSquid: bragging rights
 Astrobytes: A bunch of solutions to a bunch of problems
 Imsure1200q: rewards but if you do solve all of them, there probably will have been new ones
 HotTraveller_646: I am looking for a new job.
 Imsure1200q: thats where i know 0 things
 HotTraveller_646: If don't get job. I don't want waste my time.
 Astrobytes: Um...
 Imsure1200q: what job u interested
 HotTraveller_646: Could you explain with me?
 AntiSquid: then do contests on CG lol or go to github and contribute to some repositories there
 Imsure1200q: if you dont know what type of programming job then try solving problems and then you will realize what you like
 Imsure1200q: i guess
 HotTraveller_646: Hello, Everyone. Could you introduce new job?

 LelouchVC2: CG doesn't detect when I'm angry either

 eulerscheZahl: solvers so far: me, ille, robo and a user whom i haven't seen before
 jacek: your alt?
 Astrobytes: Only 4? Wow
 eulerscheZahl: that one also used c# and published the solution. tried it, it's much more efficient than my code
 Imsure1200q: is your method systematic?
 eulerscheZahl: i do something like breadth first search, kind of
 eulerscheZahl: i have a heuristic that promotes some actions over others
 eulerscheZahl: skipping them and trying them later
 Imsure1200q: lol mines gonna be so inefficient
 eulerscheZahl: which has some similarities with *
 eulerscheZahl: A*
 Astrobytes: a la priority queue in A*, I see
 Imsure1200q: haha ye mines gonna be so inefficient
 eulerscheZahl: and zobrist hashing for duplicate states
 jacek: and prune array
 Astrobytes: naturally
 eulerscheZahl: some testcases are close to the 1s time limit
 Astrobytes: What did the other guy use? Same method but more efficient or something totally different?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't understand every detail of it
 eulerscheZahl: but definitely more efficient implementation. with unsafe
 eulerscheZahl: (that's a C# keyword allowing you to use pointers)
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, nice
 Imsure1200q: yeah i guess porting my code to c++ will make it cfaster
 eulerscheZahl: what language are you using now?
 MostComplicatedUsername: My rank keeps sinking...
 Astrobytes: What are you using currently? JS still?
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:(

 IamTheSmix: hello again
 Imsure1200q: hi
 IamTheSmix: I am back
 Imsure1200q: euler is this efficient
 IamTheSmix: Is anyone here has ever implemented MCTS&#160;? 
 Imsure1200q: like you "rank" each platform by "action potential"
 eulerscheZahl: JS isn't a race car
 Astrobytes: rank dropping because you're not clashing MCU?
 Imsure1200q: yes i know but its my childhood lang
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes astro
 MostComplicatedUsername: i got up to like 3900
 eulerscheZahl: if you find a good way to define "action potential" it is efficient&#160;;)
 Everything_But...: Halo EveryNyan!
 Astrobytes: Do more multis, then you'll say higher for longer&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: *stay
 Imsure1200q: action potential&#160;: how much will a platform affect the paths of others
 Imsure1200q: e.g. if a platform is contained in four solid blocks, 0 action potential
 eulerscheZahl: it's hard to come up with a clever heuristic i think. you will have to test many options and see where this is going
 Imsure1200q: if a platform is blocked in two directions, means that (i havent defined this yet, lets just say) half potential
 IamTheSmix: is it mandatory to save the state of each node in the implementation of MCTS&#160;? 
 Imsure1200q: Idk but i know theres some value that will tell it
 Imsure1200q: just havent made the formula or smth
 jacek: in MCTS you explicity create nodes and save stats there
 Imsure1200q: But i dont know its just that (to me) the method im using is kinda weird but also "beautiful" and organized. Like everytime I use it it works.
 IamTheSmix: this is my class for nodes what do you think&#160;? 
 Imsure1200q: I'm worried for a more complex care where it stops working but hopefully it wont be like that

 Astrobytes: MCMTS Monte Carlo Married Tree Search
 jacek: what do you mean by regrouping parents? sorting nodes? so just sort the 'children'
 eulerscheZahl: at MCTS you have asexual reproduction. imagine it like mitosis
 IamTheSmix: when doign back I just need to +1 to all parents
 Astrobytes: If you want meiosis, use a GA
 jacek: backpropagation?
 IamTheSmix: yes
 jacek: you go to parent, then parent's parent, then parents' parent's parent and so on
 IamTheSmix: yeah I think it's better if I regroupe in one table
 eulerscheZahl: until you reach the root (of all evil)
 IamTheSmix: lol @euler
 Astrobytes: The Node of Evil. I like that
 Astrobytes: I'm gonna name all my root nodes 'money' from now on :P
 LelouchVC2: Trauma from binary trees
 LelouchVC2: I no longer have nodes
 LelouchVC2: My professor would give us the shittiest code you code imagine. triple pointers in the skeleton code
 eulerscheZahl: see it as a challenge to make it even worse when you hand in your solution
 Astrobytes: Triple pointers aren't necessarily shitty code (I'm assuming C here)
 LelouchVC2: C++, no reason to ever have triple pointers
 Astrobytes: But if you wrap things in structs it can certainly be easy to read
 jacek: but then you have to delete them
 Astrobytes: Ah, but if he's teaching C-style way of doing something then fair enough
 LelouchVC2: He didn't "teach" anything. He never once showed code in class. He'd go over concepts then give us an assignment that barely fits the concept
 LelouchVC2: I gave him plenty of shit &lt;3
 AntiSquid: what's a triple pointer?
 Astrobytes: pointer to a pointer to a pointer
 Osmanyasal: trump is gay
 goore: lol
 goore: ok
 LelouchVC2: I did not have sexual relations with that woman
 Astrobytes: Wrong prez Lelouch
 LelouchVC2: Damn
 Astrobytes: :D
 LelouchVC2: You can grab them right by the pussy
 Astrobytes: That's the one
 LelouchVC2: yay! Im smartie :3
 AntiSquid: they can grab you back, they need to check their priviledge
 Astrobytes: haha
 LelouchVC2: The amount of times a woman has just grabbed my ass
 AntiSquid: balls&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: Is more than the amount of times I've done it
 Astrobytes: Grabbed your own ass? :D
 LelouchVC2: 😂
 LelouchVC2: Grabbed a woman's ass
 LelouchVC2: Who was not my gf
 Astrobytes: Come on, you walked straight into that one
 LelouchVC2: I did DS poawjegamw
 AntiSquid: damn what are you working as? bar host?
 LelouchVC2: literally just bio class in highschool. And then once in a haunted house
 eulerscheZahl: "haunted house" :D
 Astrobytes: ass-grabbing ghosts
 AntiSquid: that reminds of Hanako-san
 AntiSquid: toilet ghost
 Astrobytes: Grabbergeists
 AntiSquid: you try to poop but ghost arm grabs you
 AntiSquid: true urban legend
 LelouchVC2: Well it was halloween. You go in and they try to scare you. This woman working in there literally grabbed by ass as I walked out
 LelouchVC2: I turned around and was like, "You're just gonna let me leave after you grab my ass?"
 LelouchVC2: Now that i think of it, it might have been a code to meet her after
 Astrobytes: Presumably she wanted to let you leave, otherwise she may have grabbed you by the throat instead
 LelouchVC2: LMAO
 goore: this isnt  what i expected from this chat but i am not disappointed tbh
 Astrobytes: It's usually a little more... constructive
 goore: thats also what i would expect
 Astrobytes: Plenty room for some random chat now and then
 struct: 116 moves first turn&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: 116 valid moves?
 struct: yes
 struct: 1324 if I increase board size to 8x8 
 Astrobytes: fking hell
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: and first move is not max moves
 struct: Im designing it so I can increase board size easily
 struct: I dont know how the game will play
 struct: I cant find any AI for it&#160;:/
 struct: Game is from 2019
 Astrobytes: We can try it out, never know until we do
 struct: Yeah, Im gonna leave this one in WIP for a while
 struct: and probably Ill need to create an ai for this one&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: like Yinsh time or .... :D
 AntiSquid: well excuse us for not satisfying you chat fetish goore
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: no Astrobytes it will be WIP but pending
 Astrobytes: Just teasing struc
 Astrobytes: t
 struct: Today I was browsing the boardgamegeek website and found a few games
 AntiSquid: which game is that struct?
 struct: This is one of them
 goore: lmao 
 struct: Not revealing yet
 goore: tbh i personally like it this way
 AntiSquid: 116 moves first turn?
 goore: the atmosphere is sometimes too professional
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: goore, it's professional when it has to be
 goore: ik
 struct: Its 1+1 action 
 Astrobytes: You can get some excellent advice
 AntiSquid: CG has a long history of cultured chat messages and memes goore
 goore: i have seen it
 struct: So thats why its so many
 jacek: like connect6?
 struct: Is that a thing jacek?
 jacek: when you can put 2 stones
 goore: btw why does your message have a color
 AntiSquid: because it's cultured duh
 Astrobytes: jacek, you must make it. Call it ConnectJacek. All the pieces are your avatar
 struct: So you make 1 move, and then make  a move on other board based on your first move
 Astrobytes: goore, if you mention someones nickname in full, it will show red
 goore: Astrobytes
 blueeyeddragon: goore
 struct: goore
 Astrobytes: Yep. And if you type the start of someone's nick then press Tab it will autocomplete
 blueeyeddragon: goore
 goore: Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: blueeyeddragon
 Astrobytes: struct
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid
 goore: its not colored for me
 AntiSquid: ban
 blueeyeddragon: yea
 goore: AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: It's only coloured for the recpient
 goore: oh
 Astrobytes: *recipient
 blueeyeddragon: oh k
 goore: has anyone here played coders strike back?
 goore: im kinda stuck
 LelouchVC2: LelouchVC2
 blueeyeddragon: LelouchVC2
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: blueeueddragon
 AntiSquid: i can't tab complete your bloody name lelouchvc2&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: wtf
 blueeyeddragon: :smile:
 goore: LelouchVC2
 goore: i can
 LelouchVC2: I can too :o
 Astrobytes: What's your question goore?
 LelouchVC2: I thought I was special
 blueeyeddragon: u gotta type the whole name first
 goore: i am stuck in bronze
 AntiSquid: no you usually don't
 goore: idk how to use the opponents cordinates
 LelouchVC2: I can type the first letter and still tab
 AntiSquid: what league are you in goore&#160;?
 goore: bronze
 AntiSquid: are there collisions in bronze?
 struct: ah Astrobytes im mistaken is not 116 moves
 struct: its 116 * 2
 struct: My bad
 Astrobytes: You can pretty much ignore them I believe in Bronze, can't remember
 Astrobytes: jeez struct
 goore: then how do i get out of bronze
 goore: i was once 9th place but changed my code to get first place and now i cant get higher than 5000th
 AntiSquid: -3 velocity
 AntiSquid: no madknight here anymore
 goore: yes there are collisions
 AntiSquid: then you can use your enemy to brake when you turn around for the next checkpoint
 AntiSquid: you push him away and you still go towards your target
 Astrobytes: Oh, you don't ignore them. My bad, been a while
 goore: so every time the checkpoint changes, i push the opponent and then continue_
 goore:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Essentially
 goore: ok
 goore: thanks
 goore: will try it now
 Astrobytes: Use the collision to your advantage
 LelouchVC2: Is this still the pac man stuff?
 Astrobytes: Nah, CSB
 LelouchVC2: I see :O
 Astrobytes: Ess Bee
 AntiSquid: well not necessarily ... you just want to turn at the right time to move as fast as possible towards the next one
 AntiSquid: but don't stress too much with leagues below gold ... rules keep changing until legend ... damn
 Astrobytes: You can't use the bounce to your advantage in Bronze? It's been so long I can't remember
 AntiSquid: i optimized my CSB for 100 speed until legend, then suddenly max speed went up to 200 and wasn't sure how to start over with optimizing it&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: lol, you did yours just mathematically right? No search I mean
 AntiSquid: you can, but if there's no enemy there then you don't wait for them or if they are too far behind the check point ignore them ... too many ifs ... need a sim pre gold and new sim after gold, sort of
 AntiSquid: some weird equation yes Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: but i kept adjusting those values until promotion
 AntiSquid: and then i had to readjust them ... so i thought fuck it
 Astrobytes: Magic formula/number ftw
 AntiSquid: and had blocker and runner, so two diff formulas
 Astrobytes: I did all this steering behaviour stuff until gold. Then started the painful process of writing sim + search, took me months (I was pretty green on searches etc)
 Astrobytes: Then just optimised everything in Legend to climb
 AntiSquid: nobody linked you magu s's tutorial for CSB? 
 AntiSquid: everyone was spamming it in chat back then
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that helped me a lot
 AntiSquid: was too lazy to write it
 AntiSquid: hence the math formulas
 Astrobytes: Was good info for getting started tbh
 AntiSquid: my first sim was a grid based game, to me that was easier
 Astrobytes: Think my first sim was the Amadeus graph one with the planets, but I screwed my search up. Then I think was LoCaM, but I kinda screwed that up until after too. Then went back to CSB to apply some of my gained knowledge
 AntiSquid: i have a sim for locm, aCat called it a heuristic bot without sim&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol wut, why? No search?
 AntiSquid: there was search 
 Astrobytes: Bad cat.
 AntiSquid: maybe he didn't like the "apply_move" + "undo_move" approach&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Perfectly reasonable approach to me
 AntiSquid: imo that's a sim
 Astrobytes: Well, don't complain. You got paid. Eventually :P
 AntiSquid: nothing personal
 struct:  Not that Im thinking I probably cant give all legal  actions if I increase board size
 struct: :thinkin:
 Astrobytes: Did they open source everyone's code?
 aCat: don't remember
 aCat: don't know
 aCat: this cat is good
 aCat: ^^'
 AntiSquid: there's a video recording 
 aCat: bleh
 AntiSquid: not everyone, you could opt out
 Astrobytes: aCat :kissing_cat:
 aCat: still don't ewmwmber
 AntiSquid: mine was too ugly and too WET :p
 Astrobytes: Ah right. What's to stop people just using other's code?
 AntiSquid: ya exactly
 Astrobytes: Well, suppose it could be used to build on I guess but...
 AntiSquid: well the new contest is same as last year, but then #1 from last year was made public
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: If there's eventually a LoCaM 2 I might do it
 AntiSquid: it's 2 lanes
 AntiSquid: 3 cards per lane
 Astrobytes: Yeah I played around with the contribution a bit
 AntiSquid: i guess it's interesting trying to adapt your bot from single lane to two lane mode
 Astrobytes: Not too hard to adapt your existing locam code I found
 AntiSquid: depends how you implemented it
 Astrobytes: Took a bit of effort, I didn't pursue it though
 jacek: whats is the rope for?
 Astrobytes: A real LoCaM 2 would be better
 AntiSquid: remember some people have a hard time going through wood after contest ... a lot of my contest bots would still work in wood after contest :p (humblebrag)
 struct: jacek how do you know there is a rope in my game?
 jacek: dont mind me, i was just going to hang myself
 goore: is there any ai writing game easier than coders strike back?
 Astrobytes: Jacek the Hackek
 AntiSquid: yes
 LelouchVC2: Just don't make a mess, someone will have to clean it
 struct: goore yes
 goore: what
 jacek: yinh
 jacek: s
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a>

 Astrobytes: lol, shameless AntiSquid, shameless plug
 AntiSquid: you can go full if-else (mostly) add few classes later on
 AntiSquid: imo that's easy
 Astrobytes: The multi with so many Wood leagues you will not believe it
 Astrobytes: What is it again? 6? 7?
 AntiSquid: 6
 AntiSquid: + it has story
 AntiSquid: how many games have a story&#160;?
 Astrobytes: By the time I implemented the minimum to pass them I was bored and haven't gone back lol
 AntiSquid: you need the right heuristics
 AntiSquid: work on your if conditions :p
 Astrobytes: True AI
 AntiSquid: lol maybe i should have linked the game to that guy
 Astrobytes: No, there's just this wall of inputs and it gave triggered my Code Royale PTSD
 Astrobytes: *and it triggered
 AntiSquid: code royale was harder, not sure how people liked it more, but ok everyone has diff preferences
 jacek: breakthrough eh? finally my n-tuple td bot exceeds my minimax bot
 jacek: but this requires about 2 milions weights ~
 Astrobytes: Code Royale was my first contest, enjoyed it at the time, hated it ever since :D
 AntiSquid: queen gang bang by knight swarm was epic
 leojean890: code royale and botg are hard :o
 Astrobytes:  Have fun compressing that jacek :D
 AntiSquid: what do you find easy leojean890&#160;?
 leojean890: hmm, reaching the top is always hard :P
 jacek: tats what she said
 leojean890: but some topics are hard to simulate&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: but some games are easier than others
 leojean890: to have something working yes
 Astrobytes: Sometimes only partial sims are needed leojean890
 leojean890: but stuck somewhere on the LB
 leojean890: yes, sometimes you can already exploit parial sims
 cegprakash: jrke created a new search
 cegprakash: for search race
 cegprakash: use same angle and thrust at every depth
 cegprakash: :D :D :D
 cegprakash: he went to sleep now
 cegprakash: I've asked him to fix it he'll be top 20 tomorrow easily
 Astrobytes: Did you find out how to pronounce his name yet ceg
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 cegprakash: oops forgot to ask him again
 Illedan: J to da R to da K to da E
 AntiSquid: i read it as "jerkeh" in my mind 
 <b>**Astrobytes slaps cegprakash</b></p><p><img src="/a/42397182026705" /> jrke: pronounce what you want cegprakash by the way my mom gave me ten mins more for coding
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I said like jerky or jirikee, or just J R K E. I like Illedan's one
 AntiSquid: tell her to back off, otherwise you won't be a master of True AI, jrke
 cegprakash: Illedan test 47 and test 43 are the ones timeouts to me frequently forcing me to reduce my time
 Astrobytes: grrr, stupid Oware
 goore: wait
 goore: AntiSquid
 goore: you made this game
 goore: lamo
 goore: lmao
 goore: that was smooth ngl
 jacek: goore easy game? try paper soccer :v
 AntiSquid: + Illedan + wildum @goore
 jrke: ya cegprakash it was my new type of search which was working fine at depth 9 and worst at depth1:joy:
 cegprakash: jacek I owe you another stream on paper soccer next week
 cegprakash: I mean this weekend
 jacek: :blush:
 goore: AntiSquid do you play dota by any chance?
 Astrobytes: lol, goore gets it
 cegprakash: jrke
 AntiSquid: used to play 
 cegprakash: we were discussing how to call your name
 goore: it really shows
 cegprakash: how do we pronounce ur name jrke
 AntiSquid: i played the original warcraft3 dota
 Astrobytes: cegprakash
 goore: i guess everyone used to play dota at some point
 jrke: ya answered this question cegprakash
 cegprakash: cool cool
 Astrobytes: I played the original Warcraft :old_man:
 cegprakash: I thought it was AntiSquid's mom
 AntiSquid: i mean i played it before they even had their first ranking system :p
 jrke: no my mom
 cegprakash: thought jrke already slept
 goore: i guess i should have said simple instead of easy
 jrke: ya just going to sleep but its good morning for your time table cegprakash at 12:35 am
 AntiSquid: most players were elitist af even back then 
 Astrobytes: I think you should pronounce jrke as "Tony" cegprakash
 jrke: so i have to make it jarvis then
 cegprakash: jacek could u plz stop wrecking me on oware
 Astrobytes: Did you even StarCraft AntiSquid, GBR-1 was great
 jacek: im trying to wreck Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: goore actually we done moba based on voting out of a bunch of game genres we were interested in
 cegprakash: at least Astrobytes is losing to me sometimes but u never lose to me jacek
 AntiSquid: could have been a tower defense instead
 Astrobytes: No cegprakash, those were timeouts  and my experimental bots. Don't get happy
 cegprakash: lolz
 goore: yeah
 goore: would have been much simpler
 cegprakash: yeah I see it's the truth
 jrke: once in a week i dare to think  to go for oware awaba and then i open it and just close it after reading rules
 struct: ceg maybe you can get rank 1 on my next multi
 Astrobytes: finally got between 900K and 1.2M root visits on first turn. Eval needs more work now
 AntiSquid: you can play a tower defense if that's what you want: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tower-dereference">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tower-dereference</a> goore
 cegprakash: struct sure
 WINWINWIN: yeah cegprakash, I managed to hold #1 on Yinsh for 15 minutes
 goore: i have already read the instructions
 Astrobytes: Gonna have to open a can of Smits on Oware I think
 goore: might aswell try to play the game
 jrke: cegprakash is 262 without collision predictor and enemy attacker in CSB due to his great sim
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: do it&#160;!
 jacek: smits isnt 1st?
 cegprakash: actually if I submit my search race bot it can easily get to top 150
 cegprakash: I've improved so much
 AntiSquid: wait Winwinwin was playing BOTG at some point, what happened?
 cegprakash: without collisions and enemy prediction I mean
 Astrobytes: No jacek, but I'm not gonna do some AlphaZero thing like Robo
 cegprakash: and no shield ofc
 struct: Doubt you can get top 150 without collisions
 jrke: cegprakash what you r 14 in search race man so why you think of top 150
 struct: but opk
 Astrobytes: Imagine life if you implemented them cegprakash
 anid: search rave top 150??
 AntiSquid: enemy prediction and colisions in search race? why&#160;?
 cegprakash: anid csb 
 anid: Ah, I see
 WINWINWIN: AntiSquid I did to BOTG
 jrke: K you mentioned search race above cegprakash
 cegprakash: jrke I need to add collisions to go to top 100
 AntiSquid: you stopped in bronze WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: collision detection I mean
 WINWINWIN: Yes, I previously went till bronze in every multi and stopped :D
 AntiSquid: ah
 WINWINWIN: Now I take a day and focus on a single multi
 AntiSquid: what are you playing?
 WINWINWIN: today was Great Escape, I think tomorrow will be BotG
 cegprakash: i need to try GAimax on CSB
 AntiSquid: so different game every day?
 WINWINWIN: Yeah
 AntiSquid: but not sure that's good, you switch too often you lose focus
 struct: WINWINWIN I think you can improve more if you stay on a multi for a week or so
 cegprakash: with opponent trying to move towards my pos + my vel
 jrke: cegprakash wants to get in top 100 i want to get in top 300 
 Astrobytes: Sometimes. But sometimes if you focus too hard on smth you lose your focus
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, I forget my logic and reasoning for the multi, probably best to focus on 1 multi a week instead
 WINWINWIN: Will start tomorrow with BotG&#160;:) 1 week try for gold :D
 jrke: then another bot programming WINWINWIN:smiley:
 AntiSquid: yes do it like a contest
 WINWINWIN: Maybe, but I enjoyed doing BOTG a lot, it was quite different from the others
 cegprakash: MadKnight did csb for 1 year WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: he was never bored of it
 WINWINWIN: Wow!!
 Astrobytes: Now he's dead.
 jrke: i am just working on CSB and from 1 month and partly spended time after reaching legend
 AntiSquid: he left CG lol
 AntiSquid: so he did get bored
 cegprakash: and then taught everyone to learn GA including myself
 AntiSquid: same game all the time kills your mood
 WINWINWIN: No, he taught me a lot on CSB
 AntiSquid: which reminds me of somone who is stuck with one game :thinking:
 jrke: i m never bored from CSB try to view replay in action mode will be more interesting
 WINWINWIN: Me too ceg
 Astrobytes: Who's that squid?
 AntiSquid: someone *
 AntiSquid: me with XR
 jacek: somepony*
 cegprakash: and I love search race for the tyre marks WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: CSB doesn't have tyre marks
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: lol, I reckon you should totally forget about XR for a bit AntiSquid
 jrke: i loved search race cause i love csb a lot
 AntiSquid: but i feel like i am really close astro
 cegprakash: I just wish the tyre screeching sound gets added to CSB and search race like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTBbTDjjHI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTBbTDjjHI</a>
 WINWINWIN: anyway gn all, will pester you all with BOTG questions tomorrow :P
 Astrobytes: jacek, still using alphabeta etc on Oware?
 Astrobytes: gn WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: gn gn all
 cegprakash: my eyes red
 jrke: cegprakash sends same video when someone ask for drift in CSB or search race:joy:
 Astrobytes: gn cegprakash
 jrke: i m also going gn
 Astrobytes: gn jrke
 cegprakash: jrke yeah I have it on my bookmarks
 Astrobytes: Should I just say goodnight to all our CGers from India?
 cegprakash: it's one of my fav movies
 jrke: whats time in scotland astrobytes
 jrke: K ceg
 Astrobytes: 20:18 jrke
 jrke: K
 jrke: gn 
 jacek: Astrobytes yes
 AntiSquid: gn8 i come back in 30 minutes
 jacek: im too slow for mcts, no bitboard yet
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: I don't have a bitboard jacek
 jacek: oh
 jacek: then how many parameters has your eval
 Astrobytes: 5 right now, but sometimes 7
 jacek: hmmm hmmmmm
 Astrobytes: my board is uint8_t[2]
 Astrobytes: I'll get around to optimising further I guess
 cegprakash: we have a queue for first in first out
 cegprakash: we have a stack for last in first out
 cegprakash: do we have a random in random out?
 cegprakash: that would be so nice for UTTT
 Astrobytes: like a Pile rather than a Heap?
 struct: i think he means when you do pop
 struct: he gets a random
 cegprakash: yeah
 cegprakash: I want pop to remove a random element 
 struct: Not hard to code
 cegprakash: and give me that element
 struct: And its better to use your own queue/heap in CG
 cegprakash: that should fasten the random move generation
 struct: if you want performance
 Astrobytes: jacek, keep your state light
 cegprakash: looks simple
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/</a>
 cegprakash: as u said struct
 cegprakash: will do it when I write UTTT
 Astrobytes: No, like implement your queue using a C-style array, and some indices/counters
 leojean890: Astrobytes #38-39 in Oware with alphabeta in python, depth 6
 cegprakash: yes yes that's what given in the above link also
 struct: not, the implemention uses vector and map
 Astrobytes: Still uses stl ceg, not ideal
 cegprakash: leojean890 I use depth 15.. same alphabeta rank 18
 Astrobytes: leojean890 convert to C++ or C, you'll get much higher
 cegprakash: well I have a variable depth
 leojean890: oh ok, but .. I use python xD
 leojean890: IK:p
 leojean890: I didn't use those languages too much recently
 Astrobytes: I've got MCTS with early playout termination
 cegprakash: how many lines of code ur bot has leojean890
 leojean890: but began slowwwly to re-use them more..
 leojean890: around 300 
 leojean890: for oware
 cegprakash: I've 400+ lines
 cegprakash: just translate to C++
 cegprakash: it's not much of an effort
 cegprakash: just copy paste and add braces
 leojean890: I think it can be ok yes
 Astrobytes: lol ceg, not quite
 leojean890: a little longer
 leojean890: :p
 cegprakash: copy paste, add braces, change print to cout 
 cegprakash: yeah extra 1 step
 leojean890: but there is the copy of states to handle
 Astrobytes: 675 for me, but a LOT of comments/commented out stuff
 leojean890: but I think it will be ok anyway:)
 cegprakash: just change def to class
 cegprakash: and add a public:
 Astrobytes: change class to struct and lose the public
 struct: Ok game is done I think, now I juist need viewer
 leojean890: but 300 lines it's not an enormous effort you're right on the general idea&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I love python at work but I'd never use python at coding contests unless I need big integers
 VN73: if you_like_doctor_who == True:prinr('+')
 leojean890: good if using only heuristics :P
 Astrobytes: prinr, the Whovian function
 leojean890: but for simu, not top :P
 leojean890: for simu high depth I meant
 cegprakash: jrke's search race sim code is 100 lines
 leojean890: I just began to create a simu for code vs zombies
 cegprakash: in c++
 cegprakash: u can write short code on c++ too leojean890
 leojean890: and I see.. 100 ms for an optim&#160;?
 leojean890: it's kind of rare
 Astrobytes: Hey, technically my depth is 0 on Oware
 leojean890: seldom
 cegprakash: wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
 cegprakash: if u use depth 0 it's probably well trained like NN
 leojean890: 100 ms EVEN the first turn..
 Astrobytes: No ceg
 Astrobytes: It's an MCTS, but instead of playouts you just eval
 Astrobytes: Still builds a tree
 leojean890: eval depth N&#160;?
 leojean890: like hill climbing&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I pick a move, and eval.
 leojean890: oh ok
 leojean890: like me in pacman
 Astrobytes: Still MCTS, you just don't actually do a playout
 Astrobytes: You can of course stop at depth N
 Astrobytes: Still EPT. But for Oware, we found depth 0 worked best 
 Astrobytes: Smits and darkhorse are both that algo, but they also have implemented MCTS solvers 
 leojean890: oh ok
 jacek: do you deal specially if there is only 1 valid move?
 Astrobytes: Robo has AlphaZero-based bot, and re Curse some kind of similar NN-based bot
 Astrobytes: No jacek
 leojean890: reCurse seems to master NNs
 jacek: and yet hes completely powerless in uttt
 Astrobytes: He came to it fairly recently and has done a great job, robo has some good ones too
 Astrobytes: Agad e's Oware is NN also I believe, not sure on pb 4
 leojean890: robostac was nicely ranked in pacman&#160;;)
 leojean890: agade does nice IAs with eval (minmax for ex), I read some of his PMs
 Astrobytes: jacek UTTT isn't really an ideal candidate for NNs it would seem
 struct: wtf have i done
 struct: I cant even create a rectangle in the viewer
 Astrobytes: It's not.... alive is it?
 Astrobytes: Oh. Ded.
 struct: It doesnt have viewer
 struct: rest  is preety much done
 Astrobytes: Nice
 Astrobytes: Yes leojean890, just wish he was a bit more active on CG
 struct: at least I think, hard to tell if its right without a viewer
 Astrobytes: (Agad e that is, Robo is)
 Astrobytes: textual output ftw struct
 struct: I can reveal the game I guess
 leojean890: some people don't have time
 Astrobytes: Lot's of old CG'ers nto around much these days tbh
 Astrobytes: *not

 Astrobytes: Oh nice
 leojean890: or do other competitions somewhere else
 Astrobytes: trictrac is gonna love it, And MSmits
 struct: Simple rules
 Astrobytes: woops, didn't mean to tag
 Astrobytes: I like the passive then aggressive moves, I'd like to play this irl
 struct: I dont know if I will need to increae board size
 struct: My code takes that into account
 Astrobytes: Might do to increase playability, we'll find out
 Astrobytes: Yes, was good thinking on your part there struct
 struct: Also if the size increases, the move max distance also increases
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 struct: if board is 6x6 there are 6 pieces per player per board (total 12) and moves can go up to 4 distance
 Astrobytes: Guess it maintains some kind of balance
 struct: Which is the height - 2
 Astrobytes: Yes I'm familiar with basic arithmetic struct :P
 jacek: so, whats the rope for?
 Astrobytes: For when you lose jacek
 struct: The rope is just visual
 struct: I dont really gonna add a rope
 Astrobytes: Might be a nice visual touch?
 struct: Ill see what I can do
 struct: Also will need stones
 struct: I guess push will look a bit weird
 hem123: any tricks to beat coders strike back gold
 Astrobytes: I like the uneven ones, but if you have to use identical ones then so be it, won't affect the game
 struct: hem123 there is no easy trick, the best I can say is check magu s csb tutorial

 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: You don't necessarily have to write a genetic algorithm, you can get far with a random search
 JBM: ahoy there
 JBM: how is ur csb
 Astrobytes: hey JBM
 Astrobytes: fix it 
 JBM: o/
 JBM: got myself 60-90 of tvc hacking
 JBM: let's get to it
 Astrobytes: gogogo
 hem123: thanks struct, was hoping I could build it more on logic. 
 hem123: but guess that inevitably I have to make some predictions and forecast a couple of events
 Astrobytes: You can just use logic and maths to do it
 Astrobytes: I took the sim and search approach myself
 Astrobytes: Reclaiming your rightful position trictrac&#160;;)
 struct: where?
 Astrobytes: Oware
 wlesavo: owhere
 Astrobytes: yea, Owhere Adonno
 struct: has robo been first for long?
 trictrac: robo is the first @ this game
 Astrobytes: Depends on who submits, sometimes he gets pulled down, the others pushed up, but top 3 is usually the same, if not in the same order
 Astrobytes: robo's is definitely the most robust I would say
 Astrobytes: Hope I'm going to make some more improvements this week on Oware
 Astrobytes: Had to leave it for a while, was pretty tired of it 
 JBM: haven't touched that game in... &gt;20 years
 JBM: was a/b mm at the time
 JBM: what's new on the scene?
 Astrobytes: AlphaZero based, ML in general, MCTS w/ EPT, and still good ol' a/b
 JBM: what's ept?
 struct: wtf I doint know what bug i have
 jacek: doesnt smits have endtables also?
 Astrobytes: and 50ms ofc
 Astrobytes: Early playout termination JBM
 JBM: thx
 Astrobytes: Don't think so jacek, not 100% sure. But he spent a loooong time fitting params offline
 Astrobytes: And he and darkhorse have the solvers also
 jacek: the solver is pretty default i think
 trictrac: AB + endgame is not enough
 trictrac: that's what I have
 jacek: i also have opening book *.*
 trictrac: good
 Astrobytes: I don't have solver yet
 Astrobytes: Just streamlined it a bit today, need to lighten my node struct a little tomorrow
 Astrobytes: I am still quite surprised how well just a/b with endgame works trictrac
 trictrac: not too bad eval
 trictrac: and pruning
 Astrobytes: yeah, do you plan to take it further or switch algorithm?
 trictrac: A day I will try alphazero approach for this game, rules are simple
 Astrobytes: That's what robo uses yeah
 Astrobytes: Does Royale still use a/b or did he change too? 
 AntiSquid: which game?
 Astrobytes: Oware
 struct: I cant understand
 struct: The code is similar to Yinsh but doesnt work
 struct: Why cant I setup the viewer
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: for your new game?
 Astrobytes: You have a bug struct :P
 AntiSquid: are you doing another hexagon game?&#160;:/
 struct: no
 struct: I revelaed the game
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/272380/shbu">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/272380/shbu</a>
 AntiSquid: i missed it
 jacek: why i dont see name or avatar in chat?
 AntiSquid: shobu&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: refresh jacek
 AntiSquid: what happened to shogi
 struct: Shogi is paused
 AntiSquid: jacek we don't like you (he won't see who wrote this)
 Astrobytes: But he needed the same letter count so went with shobu
 Astrobytes: Next is Shamu, a whale-saving optimisation game
 Astrobytes: I'm working on Harambe: The Reckoning rn 
 AntiSquid: you need to feed kids to a gorilla or something?
 AntiSquid: we don't have a side scroller game btw
 struct: omfg
 Astrobytes: You are Harambe. You have to exact revenge by eating as many as you can. With physics, on a 3D Yinsh board with FOW
 Astrobytes: And no statement ofc.
 struct: I spent so much time on this
 struct: graphics.createRectangle().setFillColor(0xcacaca).setX(1920).setY(1080);
 struct: 10/10
 AntiSquid: you overlook stuff when you are tired
 struct: Should be setWidth and setHeight
 struct: instead of x and 
 struct: y
 Astrobytes: That's fairly obvious :D
 Astrobytes: You should take a screen break now and then man
 AntiSquid: i am considering either moving over to code a la mode or do something outside CG :thinking:
 AntiSquid: i can't focus on that shit anymore ... i keep procrastinating it
 Astrobytes: What sort of outside of CG thing? ML stuff or CTFs or..?
 AntiSquid: both fun i guess
 AntiSquid: ya that or even excel / sql shit is more fun at the moment :D
 Astrobytes: lol, you really do need a break from XR
 AntiSquid: i have a NN for it
 AntiSquid: but fucked up something
 AntiSquid: it only outputs 6 6
 Astrobytes: But perhaps that is The True Move
 AntiSquid: wait ... it's supposed to be 6 3 max&#160;! damn
 Astrobytes: The game just doesn't recognise it
 AntiSquid: 6 as in max int and then 0 to 3 for direction
 AntiSquid: aha one bug found 
 AntiSquid: damn it just closed all that crap
 Astrobytes: Rubberducking in a somewhat abstract fashion eh
 AntiSquid: it has 2 outputs
 AntiSquid: should i retry now?&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: If that motivated you then yesh
 Astrobytes: Or even yeah
 AntiSquid: it outputs 6 3 now and doesn't look like it will ever adjust the bloody values T_T
 AntiSquid: nvm then
 Astrobytes: Right, leave it alone now
 justnothassa: hi every one
 JBM: and the others too!
 justnothassa: am new here and was wondering if you think this site is usfule 
 AntiSquid: hi new 
 AntiSquid: yea just get an avatar
 JBM: what for
 JBM: no, this site isn't usfule
 JBM: that i know
 Astrobytes: It's full of trolls though
 struct: It's good i learned french here
 Astrobytes: A veritable monolith of trolls
 JBM: it's dangerous to go alone
 justnothassa: lol seems full of bots
 Astrobytes: Speaking of French, struct, did Langton ever get fixed?
 justnothassa: that still beat me 
 struct: I dont know Astrobytes
 struct: Dont think so
 Astrobytes: Hm, might need to remind them
 Astrobytes: Tomorrow
 Astrobytes: cba just now
 JBM: i've read that before
 Astrobytes: What are you playing justnothassa?
 JBM: fix it
 JBM: wait, too early
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: hosw is ur csb justnothassa
 JBM: oh, some game to fix, brb, you handle the no0b
 Astrobytes: oh btw JBM, Harambe and Shamu got married and live on the Moon
 JBM: who are THOSE
 Astrobytes: Harambe the gorilla, Shamu the orca, both deceased. Another troll saying
 JBM: oh dear i'm so out of the loop
 JBM: you just give me one category and three sentences (left, no move, rifght)
 justnothassa: clash of codes
 justnothassa: what is csb
 Astrobytes: Out of the loop? Shamu was in the 70s!
 Astrobytes: Crazy Sons of Bi... I mean Coders Strike Back justnothassa
 JBM: yeah i wasn't so big on the internets in the 70s
 JBM: ah killer whales
 Astrobytes: You'll find it in this section justnothassa:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Astrobytes: I wasn't born in the 70s 
 JBM: i live very close to one of the places in france where we got them
 JBM: (in captivity)
 Lexh55: where can I see alot of java code examples 
 JBM: breeding them in captivity has been outlawed a few years ago
 JBM: not sure how that fares for them
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a welcome change in a way
 JBM: not sure either way
 Lexh55: :point_up:
 JBM: didn't know of the shamu stuff at all
 struct: Lexh55 if you solve a puzzle in java you can see other players solutions if they shared it
 Astrobytes: Exactly, hence my "in a way". I mean they're probably safer in captivity atm (which pains me to say)
 Lexh55: yeah, but some didn't have example solutions.
 Lexh55: So I got stuck or gave up 
 JBM: i was more in a "we hold many species captives, why not *that* one"
 JBM: *mood
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's captivity and captivity for show
 JBM: wp has a "list of famous cetaceans" page
 JBM: categories: real life, film, abrahamic mythology
 Astrobytes: Sadly, benefits from breeding in captivity are overshadowed by the showing aspect which funds much of it
 JBM: (and literature, but nobody cares about that one)
 Astrobytes: "list of famous cetaceans"  - A title I never thought I'd see
 Astrobytes: There's no Moby Dick?
 JBM: redirected to "List of individual cetaceans"
 JBM: there is
 JBM: literature--the category nobody cares about ^
 Daniel.jhon: this sight is not helping me
 JBM: so try the plight
 Astrobytes: Oh, I misunderstood you, my apologies
 Astrobytes: You may need an eye test Daniel.jhon
 Daniel.jhon: what?
 Astrobytes: "Daniel.jhon 10:08PMthis sight is not helping me"
 Lexh55: how do I solve the Temperatures one?
 JBM: try payong someone for a solution
 JBM: what language do you need it in?
 Lexh55: hahahaha 
 struct: Lexh55 you need to find the closest value to 0
 Lexh55: java
 Astrobytes: Write code to solve all the testcases.
 struct: you can use absolute value
 JBM: i'll do it for in JAVA for
 JBM: [computing]
 JBM: 55.67EUR
 Astrobytes: What about Clojure?
 JBM: solves all test/validation cases
 Astrobytes: ^
 JBM: guaranteed results or your monies back
 Lexh55: java for computing is that a book/
 JBM: clj is cheaper

 Daniel.jhon: how can i solve power of Thor ep 1 
 struct: 10/10 coder
 JBM: pay someone Daniel.jhon
 Astrobytes: Still waiting for someone to code a referee in Clojure
 Daniel.jhon: come on
 JBM: that's coming faster than you think
 Astrobytes: lol
 Lexh55: @struct whats that link for =?
 JBM: i'm on the fence
 JBM: clj or scala
 struct: DaNinja press the hint button on the left
 struct: Daniel.jhon*
 JBM: but that silly java can't stay
 Lexh55: Where can I find such a person to pay?
 Astrobytes: All I know is people generally disliked Kotlin ref
 Astrobytes: Daniel.jhon - make Thor go to the light.
 JBM: which is kind of a good enough reason to write more of them in my book
 Astrobytes: :D
 Daniel.jhon: i pressed it but the 3rd taste case dosen't work 
 JBM: but kotlin doesn't even *have* a rep AFAIK
 Astrobytes: Wrong flavour Daniel.jhon
 JBM: so i'd rather capitalize on the general "fear of anything new" (read, functional) java devs have
 Lexh55: wait I'm still asking about the java for computing book
 Astrobytes: (I can't get out of trolling mode today)
 JBM: and why should you?
 Astrobytes: lol JBM
 Daniel.jhon: how can i solve the 3rd taste case
 JBM: there's a "fear" missing somewhere in my other sentence over there
 struct: Daniel.jhon they give you pseudo code on hints
 JBM: no wait it's there, just not where i expected it
 Daniel.jhon: i know that
 Astrobytes: Lexh55 - in that sentence you reference, please note the brackets
 JBM: so where's the problem?
 Daniel.jhon: but I can't figure to move thor in certain degree
 Lexh55: who is JAVA for [computing] 55.67EUR
 JBM: that would be me
 JBM: [quote for "Temperatures, as of 2020-06-01
 Astrobytes: "i'll do it for in JAVA for[computing]55.67EUR"
 JBM: what's a little extra preposition between friends?
 Astrobytes: Insert a '...' after "for". Now, imagine the computer is... computing for a second
 JBM: haven't you ever played KoL?!
 Lexh55: java for [computing] what am I paying for?
 Lexh55: is the KOL comment for me?
 Astrobytes: I can only reduce my available responses to "omg" and "wtaf" for now
 JBM: valid enough (CG standards) input that happen to solve all of the validation cases for CG puzzle "temperatures"
 JBM: no kol was more for Astrobytes, but then again anybody would benefit from the exposure
 Lexh55: oh 
 JBM: i loved kol
 JBM: why have i been off
 JBM: does it even still exist
 Astrobytes: Kingdom of Loathing?
 JBM: seems so
 JBM: yup
 Astrobytes: I had a mate used to play that religiously
 JBM: have no idea what my login was anymore&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: *who used
 JBM: maybe on the old pc
 JBM: that theoretically still boots, but on a static IP
 Lexh55: java for [computing] is this a book?
 JBM: that would probably be either 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.42.1
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 JBM: kingdomofloathing.com Lexh55
 Astrobytes: Lexh55...
 Uljahn: ah KoL, loved it too
 Lexh55: yeah Astrobytes 
 Lexh55: java for [computing] what is this website for?
 JBM: Uljahn: favorite class?
 JBM: (i'm an all-around total disco bandit)
 Lexh55: wait did I miss something? 
 JBM: yes, but only because you chose to
 Astrobytes: Evidently.
 Uljahn: playing AT atm
 Lexh55: Yeah, I saw Java for [computing] 55.67EUR
 Uljahn: but now i play it once a year on crimbo season
 struct: nice 55.67 scam
 Lexh55: LOL 
 JBM: i don't even remember what AT is
 JBM: gimme 2 min
 JBM: not turtle tamer
 Lexh55: I'm not looking for a scam,
 Uljahn: accordion theft
 JBM: wouln'd have found it back
 Astrobytes: *thief
 Lexh55: Is JAVA for [computing] a book, or is someone offering me their services?
 Astrobytes: *accordion thief Uljahn

 JBM: especially if it's non-joinable
 Astrobytes: It's cool to ask if anyone wants to clash tho'.

 BatuhanOzen: okey sorry
 Astrobytes: No worries
 Astrobytes: Grrr. Painkillers getting to my concentration.
 Lexh55: yeah, will show me some solutions please I'm being nice
 Astrobytes: Solve first, you can then see other solutions.
 Astrobytes: Otherwise, you can ask pertinent questions or solve on your own
 Astrobytes: struct gave you some good advice
 Lexh55: he did
 JBM: unbelievable!

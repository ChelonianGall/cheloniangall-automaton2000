 Wontonimo: i'm still in the process of migrating my implementation to cpp.  I hear ya, but like I said, I've gotta focus on just getting it to do 1 roll out before trying to hard to optimize.  
 ZarthaxX: yes, i wouldnt bother optimizing just yet haha, and also ideas beat optimizations
 ZarthaxX: algorithmic ones i mean
 Wontonimo: yeah, so just chipping away at it.  taking a break once in a while to work on some challenges in cpp.  I've been away from having to manage memory directly for way too long.  Just looked at my cpp code from last week, and man, soo many mistakes
 Wontonimo: well, that's it for me for tonight
 ZarthaxX: haha managing memory is pain
 ZarthaxX: gn&#160;:)

 YurkovAS: kovi in bandas you use mcts? with ept depth 0-10 + eval or run random games to end?
 kovi: ept 30
 kovi: maybe i should change it to turn dependent
 YurkovAS: kovi your eval better than: pawnsMy - pawnsOp? i'm can't find better eval or some bonus\penalty
 jacek: maybe pawns in center are worth more?
 kovi: i dont have any heurstic atm. ept means draw
 YurkovAS: kovi thanks!
 kovi: yeah, overall cnt doesnt seem to matter. probably center would make more sense. 
 mokhld: I'm really struggling on these questions lol! 
 mokhld: And about to finish my masters in CS
 mokhld: any tips?

 DJSchaffner: i just had a clash where we had to calculate a sequence of which i forgot the name. can anyone help me out who recognizes this pattern:given a number, if the binary representation of the number has any parts where the length of consecutive zeros is odd, return a 1. otherwise return 0
 JohnathanBarbee: @DJ Google says Binary Gap.
 JohnathanBarbee: I hope that helps
 Astrobytes: DJSchaffner:This perhaps? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A268412">https://oeis.org/A268412</a>
 Astrobytes: (Balanced evil numbers)
 JohnathanBarbee: That looks right
 Astrobytes: DJSchaffner:Baum-Sweet Sequence
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/61158d3e1d7a95636e571f9594e7e2212405">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/61158d3e1d7a95636e571f9594e7e2212405</a>
 DJSchaffner: binary gap doesn't look quiet right. the balanced evil numbers seem to look at the number of 1's but not at the number of 0's (which shouldn't be the same) and it doesnt seem to match with the results i got. anyhow, i managed to find a better solution than what i came up with in the clash without finding a description of the sequence :D
 DJSchaffner: yes baum-sweet was it!
 DJSchaffner: thank you
 Astrobytes: DJSchaffner: if you want to look up a clash you can use this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Astrobytes: As long as you can remember some keywords you'll find it with that
 Astrobytes: and you're welcome&#160;:)
 DJSchaffner: oh that is handy. thanks i will bookmark it :D
 DJSchaffner: sometimes i remember to make screenshots to improve my solutions but i tend to forget that
 Astrobytes: try to remember/write down the name instead
 Astrobytes: easier to look up then
 MasterCoderxD: hello

 RockyBal: Hey guys! Does anyone know what kind of material does the Technical Assessment test cover?
 JLukeSkywalker: link to the test?
 JamesModifiedGames: Hey MasterCoder. How is that new code going?
 MasterCoderxD: which one brah?
 RockyBal: don't have the link yet but the title says Codingame Technical Assessment ... I'm wondering how to prepare if anyone can advice me on that, would really appreciate it 
 MasterCoderxD: James, u mean my programming language? 
 JamesModifiedGames: Yes
 JLukeSkywalker: RockyBal: im asking where does it even say that
 RockyBal: Ohh it's a job interview I have
 RockyBal: But I have no idea what to prepare for it 
 RockyBal: Thought someone might have some advice
 JLukeSkywalker: that most likely has nothing to do with codingame, this is just the platform they are using. They might make you do like puzzles and or private clash, etc
 JLukeSkywalker: I would practice by doing the practice section on here
 JLukeSkywalker: most job interviews are probably in the medium to hard puzzle range, depends on the job though
 RockyBal: Thanks a lot buddy! That really helps 
 JLukeSkywalker: np, gl
 RockyBal: truly appreciated 🙌
 JamesModifiedGames: JLukeSkywalker Could you help me with the power of thor episode 1. I solved the first testcase, but I don't know how to make it where it keeps testcase one and all the other ones.
 JLukeSkywalker: you need to make your code so that it can solve any of them based on the inputs
 JLukeSkywalker: you cant just hardcode up for test cast 2 for example
 JamesModifiedGames: Would you be able to give me an example?
 JLukeSkywalker: if your current position is above the targer, move down
 JLukeSkywalker: if your current position is below the target, move up
 JamesModifiedGames: Okay
 JamesModifiedGames: And if your left go and and vise versa?
 JLukeSkywalker: yep
 JamesModifiedGames: okay thank you much
 JLukeSkywalker: and you can also move diagonals
 JamesModifiedGames: Like SE And SW
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah
 Astrobytes: and don't forget to update Thor's position when you move.
 JamesModifiedGames: okay thank you
 JLukeSkywalker: so if you are above and to the left, you would go SE
 JamesModifiedGames: What do you mean Astrobytes
 JLukeSkywalker: your current position isnt given
 JLukeSkywalker: you have to keep track yourself
 Astrobytes: You're only given his starting coordinates in the input.
 JamesModifiedGames: So for testcase 2 his position is (31,17), so whenever he ends the run i would have to tell the system that his new position is (31,4). Is that what you mean?
 JLukeSkywalker: if you move north you have to subtract one from your y
 cooldude420: Hello guys, I hope everyone is having a great day!
 JLukeSkywalker: then recalculate which direection to move in
 Astrobytes: One step = 1 turn
 Dflat: hiii
 JamesModifiedGames: OKay, that makess sense.

 ichwarsnix: click the bell in the upper right corner
 ichwarsnix: there you find all notifications, including coc you finished
 ZarthaxX: AfkByto
 Astrobytes: StealthaxX
 Astrobytes: o
 ZarthaxX: waddup
 ZarthaxX: thought you put steal and i was gonna ask what did i steal
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 Astrobytes: :DYeah all quiet here man, how's things for you?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just found the mathematical way to solve Paving with Bricks, anyone else do it without backtracking and counting?
 Astrobytes: HAven't done that one
 ZarthaxX: i did a final exam 2 days ago and got the mark of a final exam i did on december the same day :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: main formula is on pg. 5  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0501170.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0501170.pdf</a>
 Astrobytes: Haha, get the result you wanted ZarthaxX?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: have to modify for odd rectangles
 ZarthaxX: yeeee double 10 baby
 Astrobytes: nice!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Must be an A. American thing...;) hey zarthy
 ZarthaxX: one of those subjects was algorithms and data structures 3, the last one of its kind
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm sure I came across that on SO or wikipedia
 PatrickMcGinnisII: S. amer
 ZarthaxX: no more algorithms for me 
 Astrobytes: Now you are MasterOfAlgorithmsaX
 ZarthaxX: sax :P
 Astrobytes: yes algorithm sax
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, formula is on the wiki
 ZarthaxX: i dont think so but it feels good to end that topic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but it doesn't tell you how to do odd rectangles
 ZarthaxX: anyway, will have holidays with gf family in a couple days too
 Astrobytes: Ah cool, time to relax a bit at least
 Astrobytes: well - hopefully!
 ZarthaxX: yee some beach and chill
 ZarthaxX: i was in a hurry to finish this exam for that lol
 ZarthaxX: anyway holidays with corona are strange
 Astrobytes: Man I could do with some of that beach stuff. Instead we have 40 cm of snow.
 ZarthaxX: im more of a cold guy so i would like to swap places
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 mr.idiot: oh hi
 Saad-py: hey hey hey hey 
 Astrobytes: I like the cold but... it's a bit toooo cold out there
 Saad-py: Wassup
 ZarthaxX: how many degrees?
 Saad-py: Any one knows a good tutorial or website for all python inbuilt function cause instead of using ord I made a long list and LOL I was last
 Saad-py: Te question was some of ascii values of string
 Saad-py: or char
 Astrobytes: only about -4 ish last I checked, but feels more like -9 or 10
 JLukeSkywalker: there isnt really a way to learn all of those other than just doing puzzles on here and looking up ways to complete them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its 25C here
 Astrobytes: was -22.9 up north last night
 Saad-py: Anybody watched Dream's manhunt finale
 ZarthaxX: -22.9 O.O
 ZarthaxX: okey that's WAY too cold lol
 Saad-py: maybe fahrenit
 Saad-py: e
 Astrobytes: second lowest was back in 1995, -27.5
 Astrobytes: No, C
 Saad-py: oof
 Astrobytes: *-27.2, my bad
 Saad-py: Too cold eh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not great.
 Saad-py: you are a mod
 Saad-py: where do you live
 Astrobytes: Excellent observation.
 Astrobytes: Modland.
 RoboStac: unfortunately mod powers don't let us control the weather&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I mean Scotland.
 Saad-py: I live in the UAE, its hot in here even in winters
 Saad-py: lol
 Astrobytes: lol RoboStac
 ZarthaxX: lol robo :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: i mean you can wear clothes and all good i guess?
 Saad-py: how many programminglanguages do you guys know
 ZarthaxX: it's not like when it's like 38 C
 Astrobytes: Well I don't normally go around naked ZarthaxX!
 Saad-py: lol
 Saad-py: Why do people not share there code in clashes it is so helpful when they do and so frustrating and annoying when the don't
 JLukeSkywalker: i shared
 Astrobytes: It's not mandatory, sometimes if you message or ping them they might share with you
 JLukeSkywalker: you didnt even try though
 Saad-py: i know but they others
 Astrobytes: Why would you want the solution if you didn't at least try?
 JLukeSkywalker: if you dont even try the problem and just hit submit instantly, you arent going to get better
 Saad-py: I do try to message them, they react like I am a 10 y/o asking for candy
 Saad-py: Like I always try BRUH
 Astrobytes: If you're failing at clashes, try doing easy puzzles
 ZarthaxX: altho i could see you naked bb&#160;:*
 Saad-py: lmao
 JLukeSkywalker: submitting 0% at 3 minutes in shortest is not trying
 Astrobytes: True. Hahaha, wait til summer :P
 Saad-py: Which easy puzzles any links where can I fin it
 JLukeSkywalker: just go do any of the easy puzzles

 Saad-py: yeah thanks for your help everyone
 Saad-py:&#160;:) Love the help
 Saad-py: Never thought someone woud advice a 13 y/o like me 
 JLukeSkywalker: no-one cares how old you are, and wouldnt even know unless you say it
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's not particularly relevant.
 Saad-py: How do I save my easy puzzles
 JLukeSkywalker: saves once you press play
 Astrobytes: The solution is saved when you play your code
 Astrobytes: lol, I'm too slow today
 Saad-py: ok
 Gurp1272: Does anyone have a job coding with Ruby?

 Astrobytes: Which game?
 JLukeSkywalker: fantastic bits
 JLukeSkywalker: bronze league currently

 KiwiTae: hey o/ pewpew
 Audatic: the shortest code ones are a lot of fun but meaningless if you code in Java vs Ruby. Why don't you make them language specific? E.g. fix a language for each clash?
 JLukeSkywalker: the code golf is language specific. clash is jsut supposed to be quick battles, you win some, you lose some
 JLukeSkywalker: python is a useful language to know anyway, and easy. if you want to get shortest clashes, worth picking it up
 Audatic: okay I haven't seen the code golf section. And yes I do python for those but ruby beats me still :D
 JLukeSkywalker: barely anyone uses ruby in clash, got up to position 100 with just python
 Audatic: well I only did 5 shortest ones so far, won 1 (no ruby) and lost 4 (all to ruby). But maybe the sample size is too small
 JLukeSkywalker: if you get 2/8 and i think even 3/8 you will usually still improve your ranking
 JLukeSkywalker: even if you didnt 'win'
 Audatic: yeah I got 2/8 but I need to win&#160;;) Anyway will check out the code golf 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/siman-man/ruby-golf-style-guide">https://github.com/siman-man/ruby-golf-style-guide</a>
 struct: ofc there are a lot more tricks
 Audatic: can I see my past clashes?
 JLukeSkywalker: CG has only 4 puzzles, but you are ranked based on your top 5 language submissions for each
 struct: Only the code
 JLukeSkywalker: shows on the results page, can get to that in your notification bell after everyone finishes
 Astrobytes: Wonder why there aren't more golfable puzzles? I'm not massively into it but curious.
 JLukeSkywalker: if you want  to find the actual puzzle, you can look it up here if you remember anything about it:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 JLukeSkywalker: just for practice purposes, you wont gain ranking or anything from doing it outside of clash
 AlmostAtom: question: is it normal that some test cases don't work anymore when using c++ and cout? third time for today that i always get answer "Nothing"... but when submitting i get 100%
 struct: trailing spaces maybe
 JLukeSkywalker: Astrobytes:I think because other than the solution (which is what normal puzzles are for) every CG problem ends up just being the same
 AlmostAtom: but shouldnt trailing spaces also be a problem when submitting?
 Astrobytes: You mean system calls etc?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: and hi struct o/
 struct: hi astro
 Astrobytes: Is euler boycotting CG or something?
 struct: idk
 struct: Havent seen him online on discord either
 Astrobytes: He came on earlier this evening, first I've seen him in 7 or 8 days
 Astrobytes: Not seen him on CG at all
 KiwiTae: maybe he got a life or smth&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Nonsense :P

 Astrobytes: "Highly rated disco balls"
 MSmits: yes, I am guessing they are much flashier than the low rated disco balls
 MSmits: those are basically just balls
 Astrobytes: Or rounder
 MSmits: sure, that too
 Astrobytes: You could start selling them on the Unity store
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I still get about 1 dollar a month from my sphere :P
 MSmits: it was 1 afternoon of coding
 MSmits: imagine how much money i could have made if I had spent my time doing unity stuff :P
 Astrobytes: You should do more, in between bots and meta-mcts
 Astrobytes: might get $5!
 MSmits: yeah. Maybe after I am done with my studies
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, almost forgot about those
 KiwiTae: you made unity asset?

 MSmits: I had it at 1 euro at first
 MSmits: sometimes i get mails form unity. I always ignore them :P
 KiwiTae: thats nice
 KiwiTae: I am thinking of putting some stuf on ue4 
 struct: Is email public by default?
 struct: I can see it and im not even logged in
 MSmits: yeah  Iguess I need to change that
 Astrobytes: Too late, we've sent our botnets to Innoble
 MSmits: lol 
 MSmits: well I completely redid my uttt bot
 MSmits: it's a completely new bot. Did almost everything differently
 MSmits: and now I basically have two bots that are rank 3-4 :P
 Wontonimo: oh,
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: almost everything different .... i was going to ask what's the major change
 MSmits: i didnt submit it, but it has the same winrates, more or less
 Astrobytes: Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating so submit it
 MSmits: very heavy expansion function with massive pruning
 MSmits: only 50-60k rollouts
 MSmits: very heavy rollouts too
 MSmits: i am not yet done with the bot so not submitting
 Wontonimo: i'm curious if it has a different place in the RockSissorsPaper landscape of various bots
 MSmits: i migth just take what i learned with this bot and improve my other one with it
 Astrobytes: doesn't j acek do quite heavy rollouts on uttt? OR was that someone else
 MSmits: i think he does
 MSmits: mine are much heavier i am sure
 struct: he had low number of rollouts
 Wontonimo: interesting ... how many rollouts was your other bot?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, due to heaviness iirc
 struct: but he didnt really said how he measured them
 Astrobytes: Always an issue
 MSmits: the fastest version had 130k, the one i currently have on the leaderboard 90k
 MSmits: I also used some avx in this new bot
 struct: just for wincheck?
 struct: or somethign else'
 MSmits: several things
 MSmits: also generating available moves
 Wontonimo: nice
 MSmits: check end of game for both players at once
 MSmits: testing for dead boards
 MSmits: boards that arent ended, but can only draw
 struct: I see
 struct: you load the current board into _m256
 struct: and then check 
 Wontonimo: do you think there's a chance that a draw is sometimes your best option?
 struct: right?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e1ec4011-ac51-4bd7-bcbb-e39d90a4265a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e1ec4011-ac51-4bd7-bcbb-e39d90a4265a</a>
 MSmits: board 1 and 2 are player and opponent
 MSmits: Wontonimo how do you mean?
 Astrobytes: oddly enough, I was looking through these avx instructions earlier. Very cool.
 Wontonimo: is there a situation where your opponent could win, but you cant and a tie is your best option?
 MSmits: definitely
 MSmits: well thats true almost by definition
 MSmits: if you cant win and your opponent can, then a draw is your best option, bot on a miniboard and on the bigboard
 MSmits: unless giving up the miniboard to a loss benefits you in the overall board
 MSmits: as for draws in general. a draw is basically a win for player 2
 Wontonimo: so when you trim draws, how do you prevent giving a win to the opponent?
 MSmits: trim?
 Wontonimo: i must have misread. ... "testing for dead boardsboards that arent ended, but can only draw"
 MSmits: let me give you an example, sec
 Wontonimo: i read that as trim
 struct: union { __m256i boards256; __m128i boards128[2]; };
 struct: There should be a better way for this
 struct: _mm256_inserti128_si256(_mm256_castsi128_si256(lo),(hi),1)
 struct:  // Join two 128-bit vectors
 MSmits: XOOOXXX.O
 MSmits: = dead board
 komple1: is there a rank system in website?
 MSmits: struct let me see
 komple1: i mean in clashes
 Wontonimo: ah, on the mini boards.  I see.  thought it was for the overall game.
 MSmits: no just the minis
 MSmits: it's useful information to have
 Wontonimo: super!  i like it
 Wontonimo: it's someting i havent addressed
 MSmits: if a board is dead, it doesnt matter which square on it you play, if they all lead to a finished board
 MSmits: so you only allow 1 such move
 MSmits: prune the rest
 MSmits: uttt has tons of these little ways to prune
 MSmits: but it's pretty expensive
 MSmits: dont know what this does struct
 MSmits: _mm256_inserti128_si256(_mm256_castsi128_si256(lo),(hi),1)
 MSmits: you insert two at once?
 MSmits: and it's faster?
 struct: I dont know if its faster
 struct: I just copied it from the library
 MSmits: ah ok
 Wontonimo: i did toy with a heuristic to prefer moves that narrowed the opponents choice.  yeah my current bot is in silver, but it made a significant difference.  It was a computationally cheap check.  I'm scrapping that python bot ... very close to having v1 of my bitboard cpp bot done
 MSmits: i actually tried a negative childmax bias
 MSmits: to give a selection bias to nodes with a lot of children
 MSmits: this would penalize moves that lead to a  free move as well
 MSmits: but it didnt work on my new bot
 MSmits: i have -0.15 penalty on my leaderboard bot for free moves
 MSmits: on selection.  That helps a bit
 MSmits: didnt work for my new bot
 MSmits: only shows how these things interact with other parts of your bot
 Wontonimo: yeah, for sure

 MSmits: ok so it works
 struct: yeah, im just not sure if its faster
 MSmits: i would still have to union it
 MSmits: because of the last line where i do the comparison
 MSmits: with the zeros
 MSmits: it's sad i cant do one for 256
 MSmits: instruction doesnt exist
 MSmits: some 256 instructions that could be useful do exist, but need avx 512
 struct: None of the test ones works?
 MSmits: hmm for 256?

 MSmits: mmh which one should i try?
 MSmits: not sure what that ZF and CF stuff means
 struct: one sec
 Astrobytes: CG uses Haswell arch only?
 struct: yes
 YurkovAS: zf: zero flagcf: carry flag
 MSmits: ok, but what is the carry flag used for?
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_flag">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_flag</a>
 Astrobytes: when you carry a bit in an arithmetic operation
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's a better explanation than mine :D
 MSmits: ah, right
 struct: !_mm256_testz_si256(boards, _mm256_set1_epi16(1))
 struct: or without the&#160;!
 MSmits: isnt this the same as using !_mm256_testz_si256(boards,boards)
 MSmits: you dont need to set the 1's
 MSmits: if I and it with itself, it is its own mask
 struct: I think so
 MSmits: I'll try
 MSmits: I'll probably notice when it starts solving wrong, if it doesnt, then its probably working
 MSmits: yeah it's solving wrong :P
 MSmits: wait, maybe i needed to remove the&#160;!
 MSmits: so far so good
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/528198325">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/528198325</a>
 MSmits: seems fine
 MSmits: I like the early solving i often get
 MSmits: with this new bot
 MSmits: now the goal is not to solve as a loss all the time vs the top 2:P
 Astrobytes: Well, at least it's accurate!
 YurkovAS: you has more rollouts than tomatoes?
 MSmits: though sometimes i solve as a loss and then the next turn i solve as a draw because re curse made a mistake. I love that&#160;:)
 struct: And it should not be slower
 MSmits: this bot has only 60k rollouts YurkovAS
 struct: Do you notice any performance diff?
 MSmits: it's very heavy on expansion pruning and random rollouts
 MSmits: it wasnt a bottleneck struct so i cant really test
 struct: ah ok
 MSmits: but it has to be at least as good
 MSmits: so thanks
 struct: np
 Astrobytes: Probably wouldn't be noticeable with such heavy pruning/rollouts
 MSmits: well it's part of the pruning. Basically, on every expansion I test all playable boards for being dead boards
 Astrobytes: Ah, yeah, no bottleneck, chat lag
 MSmits: I could optimize it a bit more ofc
 Astrobytes: Yeah I get your pruning
 MSmits: also I don't have any end of game checks in my bot anymore. I never check 3 in a row
 Astrobytes: Yesterday you were pruning too much
 MSmits: I check if  a 3 in a row is possible for the opponent if i play a move
 MSmits: and if it is, i dont play the move
 MSmits: i do the same thing with connect 4, i never check for 4 in a row with that. I just generate winning moves and make sure the opponent doesnt get them
 MSmits: and if no possible moves are left after that, I lose
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: so games are never won, only losts
 MSmits: it makes it so that when you get a free move. You eliminate all moves that would make your opponent win the next turn
 Astrobytes: Well, something isn't right for your UTTT since you are not first :P
 MSmits: ah well re curse isnt here, so someone else had to say that :p
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: you're right, but I have plenty of stuff to try, I have to simplify my bot a bit. I am up to 2k lines with this new version
 MSmits: I also think there's a lot to experiment with in the random rollout
 MSmits: when to always take a win, when to avoid free moves
 MSmits: I currently have it to always take wins and always avoid free moves otherwise. Thats probably not optimal
 Astrobytes: Isn't this why people use ML to tune these things... :P
 MSmits: It's interesting that re curses bot and kar liso's bot are both equally strong
 MSmits: sure re curse wins with a 60% winrate vs kar liso
 MSmits: but thats mostly RPS i think
 MSmits: all my bots do worse vs kar liso
 MSmits: so it's definitely possible to beat his NN with a regular bot
 Astrobytes: Most probably. I can't remember much about karlis o's uttt bot tbh
 MSmits: he has a reasonably heavy rollout and good performance
 MSmits: i think he experimented a lot with the rollout
 Astrobytes: Well OK I know that :DI remember him talking about the details one dayt
 Astrobytes: *day
 struct: There are only 16 dead boards?
 MSmits: he has many different functions depending on the stage of the rollout
 MSmits: i think
 MSmits: 16?
 Astrobytes: Yeah something along those lines 
 MSmits: nah, has to be way more
 MSmits: they dont all have 1 square left either
 MSmits: some habe 2
 MSmits: i found one with 3 squares left
 MSmits: it's a bit hard to figure out, but let me try
 MSmits: mmh probably not 3
 struct: Any reason why your function only takes 16 boards?
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: now i understand your question
 MSmits: there are 8 win masks
 MSmits: and i use them for 2 players
 MSmits: 8 ways to win
 struct: ah I see
 struct: Did not notice that it was same mask repeated twice
 MSmits: having a hard time to come up with many dead boards btw
 MSmits: seems like every one i found only has 1 square left.
 MSmits: there's still a lot of those, but maybe i can code it better 
 reCurse: struct can you come up with some other game to distract him?
 darkhorse64: Play fireworks, there is no search and no bitboards, just ifs
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: hey, you're the one who steers people my way when they have uttt questions. Don't act all surprised when they get me addicted again&#160;:
 MSmits: :P
 reCurse:&#160;?
 MSmits: I remember someone asked you questions and you said something on the order of go ask msmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's like offering  a beer to an alcoholic
 reCurse: Not sure I recall
 MSmits: it's fine either way. I kinda enjoy this uphill battle of trying to beat a NN and whatever monster karliso created
 reCurse: Don't make me backport all my improvements back to uttt
 MSmits: mmh you've been busy then? Uttt was not that long ago
 reCurse: uttt-&gt;bt-&gt;othello-&gt;checkers
 reCurse: Each one had improvements I have not backported
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: but they would have to be improvements that would be more than just shortened training time
 struct: oh you got rank 1 on checkers
 struct: nice
 reCurse: Yes I did take care of not talking nonsense this time
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: well I'll let you know when you need to backport :P
 reCurse: struct, does it go faster if I paypal you
 struct: lol
 struct: just give me a game and ill port
 reCurse: Well no finding the right game is part of the job
 MSmits: struct think of all the income you missed this last year distracting me 
 MSmits: hey reCurse, i wonder, how do you know if these improvements are game specific? Or did you change things that are provably better?
 MSmits: because you might change something, get an improvement, but it might just be for that game
 MSmits: obviously i dont know what the nature of the changes were
 reCurse: Well yeah naturally, but I have good reasons to think they are either domain-agnostic or would apply to uttt as well
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: And I can't use this pipeline anymore, need to come up with better, 55% gpu usage pains me.
 MSmits: isn't it just a time issue? Do you have it running all the time?
 reCurse: Sure
 MSmits:  iwould be happy if my gpu wast running 100%
 MSmits: the things tend to melt
 reCurse: But I just spent good money on a gpu I'm not maxing out
 reCurse: It's wrong
 MSmits: it may live longer if you dont max it out
 reCurse: Citation needed
 MSmits: i'm no expert but i melted some gpus when i was still gaming
 reCurse: Could be a number of things
 struct: how?
 MSmits: may just be a fabrication error, dust, or something else
 reCurse: The only time I killed a gpu is because it was amd
 reCurse: Not making that mistake again
 MSmits: one time the temperature thingy told me 105 degrees Celsius
 MSmits: was dead soon after
 reCurse: Well yeah it's not supposed to go that far
 reCurse: Doesn't matter the usage
 reCurse: Something was faulty
 MSmits: probably
 MSmits: but these things do have wear and it would not surprise me if they wear out faster with full usage
 YurkovAS: time to submit "dead boards" solver78.10% 8.60% (new vs best)73.50% 11.30% (best vs new)
 reCurse: This claim requires matching evidence
 MSmits: it actually works YurkovAS?
 YurkovAS: joke :smiley:
 MSmits: i just took out part of that code
 MSmits: lol
 YurkovAS: by statistic is real
 struct: Doesnt the wear only lower clock speed?
 MSmits: no idea, I am just guessing
 MSmits: reCurse is right, you need evidence to say anything conclusive
 reCurse: There are so many factors in play to killing electronics
 MSmits: YurkovAS I think your stats might be a random fluctuation, because now that I think of it, the dead boards thing doesnt even work for a single board move
 MSmits: if there is only 1 square left, it doesnt prune anything
 YurkovAS: MSmits i'm change final stage for find best child node of root: find child node with max visits, to: find child node with max score (wins / visits)
 YurkovAS: and test in brutal tester, n = 1k
 MSmits: i always take max score, but never did much experimentation
 MSmits: most of the time max visits will be identical to max score
 reCurse: :raise_eyebrow:
 MSmits: the exception is when your bot discovers a new deep line of play that raises the score of 1 child a lot but it doesnt have enough time to increase visits
 MSmits: because calculation time is almost up
 MSmits: something like that anyway
 MSmits: but it works both ways, either picking visits or score can give a bad choice
 MSmits: there are some variations like "most robust child" that use a combination of both I think

 MSmits: this gives some options
 YurkovAS: thanks
 MSmits: I guess I should just run some CG bench and try all these. I<i>m curious to see if it even matters </i>
 MSmits: it's hard to find things in uttt that matter&#160;:)
 reCurse: Only thing that matters is the way out
 MSmits: there is no way out
 Astrobytes: A sentence to live by if I ever heard one.
 RockNTroll: Anybody here making way too much money coding?
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's a real problem
 RockNTroll: yeah how do you fix it
 Wontonimo: spending time on CG and not work
 RockNTroll: really?
 RockNTroll: you look very old
 Wontonimo: well, eventually deliverables will be missed if I keep at CG
 Wontonimo: this may shock you, but it's not an actual picture of me
 RockNTroll: wtf how
 ZarthaxX: that's shocking
 Wontonimo: i know!
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 RockNTroll: Why would you do that
 Wontonimo: he is my spirit animal
 RockNTroll: that's so cool
 Wontonimo: looks like he's suffered scurvy but could still gut you if needed
 RockNTroll: Does he make a lot of money coding?
 RockNTroll: I see
 Wontonimo: hmm, vscode just crashed on me for the 4th time today
 Wontonimo: it don't like uttt
 RockNTroll: too bad
 Wontonimo: ugh, random playouts called from one section of code works just like fancy pants, and another section always returns a draw.  same code, called from two different places
 Wontonimo: it took an hour and a half, but I found the root cause of the error.  It was between my keyboard and my chair
 Wontonimo: note&#160;: if you don't initialize your lookup cache, it won't be initialized
 Wontonimo: 20k rollouts in 0.096s on my pc.  Getting closer.  Way better than my python implementation of 600 rollouts in 0.1 sec

 Unkmar: What measurment are you given of the circle?  radius, diameter, circumfrence?
 Unkmar: What is the given information?  angel in degrees or radians?
 Unkmar: if angle is in radians, Just multiply angle by radius.
 Rodrigo_the_coder: need help for angle input. coders strike back.
 MadKnight: u can just reset your code
 jacek: good morning
 jacek: are you mad, knight
 CopperFr: shadow of the madknight
 Krryptonian: i am new to codingame 
 JBM: we've all been
 Krryptonian: :joy:
 professional_dumbass: is there a problem with my ide
 professional_dumbass: code editor
 professional_dumbass: i don't see people who submitted
 jacek: mhm
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you even submit
 Automaton2000: is it because of the way
 ThunderbirdOne: is it the way though Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i don't get what you're saying
 Whatar: why are we still here Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: somehow i have a question, how do you know if i got it
 Flat_Erick: Why am I not promoted even thou im rank 1 in my league and ive beaten the boss easily?
 PurCHES5: cuz u need to wait for a while
 Flat_Erick: Do i need to be online?
 PurCHES5: there should be a downcount on the top left corner of your IDE
 Flat_Erick: Ive just been promoted xD Thanks mate
 PurCHES5: np
 PurCHES5: good luck
 Flat_Erick: You too&#160;;)
 jacek: CSB?
 Bob: CSB -&gt; -3v
 jacek: Automaton2000 whats -3v
 Automaton2000: if a unit is on an inactive cell at the start
 TheCodeKid123: good morning yall
 TheCodeKid123: Automation2000 what is the first coding language created?
 eulerscheZahl: you have to spell the name correctly to get an answertab-completion can help
 eulerscheZahl: aut[tab] =&gt; Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what would be the same as the ones used during the event. your final score may thus differ from your ...
 TheCodeKid123: oh but what is it
 jacek: how first compilator was compiled?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)</a>
 2ndwolf: it would be nice to have our replays in another window, for us with 2 screen
 2ndwolf: the debug mode is convenient but having to switch from fullscreen to ide isn't optimal
 eulerscheZahl: why don't you just click the 3 dots below the replay?
 2ndwolf: ooo you'r eright
 2ndwolf: I clicked that before but because it said share I didn't realize it was what I needed

 eulerscheZahl: i see a school bus
 2ndwolf: lol my bot beats bronze league 1 boss but I'm loosing ranks in arena
 2ndwolf: (coders strike back)
 TheCodeKid123: bro program an A.I
 TheCodeKid123: I am the only one that is not a mod wow i am ashamed of myself
 2ndwolf: if(TheCodeKid123.chat()){
 2ndwolf: answer();
 2ndwolf: }
 TheCodeKid123: what?
 2ndwolf: there u go, here's an ai
 2ndwolf: just gotta work out the specifics
 TheCodeKid123: Lol
 TheCodeKid123: Wow
 TheCodeKid123: i should of said to make a robot&#160;:(
 2ndwolf: aren't those the same thing
 TheCodeKid123: But i am not a robot that's why
 TheCodeKid123: if(2ndwolf.chat()){                                               answer();                                                           }
 TheCodeKid123: lololololol
 TheCodeKid123: I am not a bot
 TheCodeKid123: Hey what language are you the best at
 2ndwolf: gs1
 TheCodeKid123: really i am only good at english and spanish 
 TheCodeKid123: i don't know how to code
 2ndwolf: pilluelo
 TheCodeKid123: Callate gatito
 TheCodeKid123: You know spanish wow
 2ndwolf: for laughs
 TheCodeKid123: lol thats all you know haha
 2ndwolf: I don't know much but I had lessons in high school
 TheCodeKid123: Well i know you will learn
 TheCodeKid123: Do you know a website where i can code that is not Unity or Buildbox and besides this one?
 Angelbilly: hi there
 TheCodeKid123: hi
 TheCodeKid123: Do you know a website where i can code that is not Unity or Buildbox and besides this one?
 TheCodeKid123: send me the link
 TheCodeKid123: w
 2ndwolf: we understood first time I think
 2ndwolf: I learned to code on graal XD
 2ndwolf: honestly it sucks now so don't code on graal
 TheCodeKid123: I am not sure of that that why i typed again
 Insufficient: what sort of coding do you want to learn how to do
 TheCodeKid123: python
 Insufficient: for what purpose
 TheCodeKid123: JavaScript
 TheCodeKid123: games and websites
 Insufficient: honestly for those applications probably do some of the online courses
 Insufficient: codingame is good too for games&#160;:)
 Angelbilly: yes i am learning java script with online courses and books
 Angelbilly: there are not many websites that are free to do that
 TheCodeKid123: yeah but what about websites
 2ndwolf: oh
 2ndwolf: eloquent javascript
 Insufficient: try udemy or coursera
 2ndwolf: is a very good resource
 TheCodeKid123: i know Codingame for games but i don't know for websites
 TheCodeKid123: coursera did not work for me
 Angelbilly: yea eloquent java script is good but i thought it was a little complicated for beginers
 2ndwolf: just search eloquent javascript, the book is free on their website
 2ndwolf: really?
 2ndwolf: it starts from the basics
 2ndwolf: there are some chapters that flew over my head but it's ok, it makes it a complete book
 TheCodeKid123: thanks guys yall are a big help
 Angelbilly: yes i agree i would recomend eloquent java script
 Insufficient: also there are actually a ton of good youtube videos on web development etc, just have an explore
 Insufficient: also my friend is a game dev and he taught himself and did game jams on itch.io
 2ndwolf: ludum dare &lt;3
 Insufficient: so yeah dig around playing with game engines like unreal, unity etc
 Angelbilly: im just finishing python and i am learning html and java script but i got a long way before i could be a great programer
 2ndwolf: notch is a ludum dare contestant :P
 2ndwolf: or used to be
 Angelbilly: one questions what do you think is the best gui
 TheCodeKid123: what gui
 Angelbilly: because the other day i wanted to export a program to my computer using tkinter but the computer thinks is a virus and it doesnt make me use it as a stand alone program
 TheCodeKid123: i have no idea but i use tynker too
 TheCodeKid123: And how do i use Coursera
 TheCodeKid123: and udemy?
 Angelbilly: if i'm not wrong you gotta pay for udemy i guess, i'm not sure though
 TheCodeKid123: I know you have to pay wich i do not want
 TheCodeKid123: wgat about coursera
 Angelbilly: the same thing i guess
 Angelbilly: you gotta pay
 TheCodeKid123: oh well i can't use itch.io either it blocked for me
 DBDuy: how do i save ongoing project guys&#160;?
 TheCodeKid123: idk
 2ndwolf: test it
 TheCodeKid123: i am noob at coding
 PovilasDauksys: how to change int to string in c#?;/
 TheCodeKid123: what??????????????????????????????????????????:confused:
 2ndwolf: have you tried googling it.........
 TheCodeKid123: Can mods see what people chat in DM
 TheCodeKid123: no
 AntiSquid: how's your game TheCodeKid123?
 TheCodeKid123: my game?
 AntiSquid: the one you wanted to make
 jacek: The Game?
 TheCodeKid123: I am very bad at coding is all i am going to say about it
 TheCodeKid123: how come you can chat red
 jacek: because hes the mod
 jacek: and speaking red when angry
 TheCodeKid123: 2ndwolf is not a mod and had chatted red
 jacek: he was angry
 jacek: specifically at you, TheCodeKid123
 MadKnight: say red to TheCodeKid123 Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think it is a great ide
 TheCodeKid123: How do you do it :rage:
 TheCodeKid123: plz tell me
 TheCodeKid123: Automation say red
 eulerscheZahl: Automaton2000 say hello
 Automaton2000: i guess you would need to use some form of it
 TheCodeKid123: Automaton say red
 jacek: AutomatonNN can you say red to someone
 AutomatonNN: that was a lot of time to read
 TheCodeKid123: huh can yall plz tell me
 jacek: alt+f4
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN can tell you
 AutomatonNN: what is the first time i came here?
 TheCodeKid123: i don't have F4
 eulerscheZahl: even Mac users have an F4
 TheCodeKid123: i don't have f4
 TheCodeKid123: help
 eulerscheZahl: i'm hungry. and the good news is I have beans&#160;:)
 TheCodeKid123: please i have a chrome and it don't have f4
 TheCodeKid123: lol
 jacek: hi hungry, im dad
 TheCodeKid123: plz
 jrke: two automation&#160;?
 TheCodeKid123: Automaton2000 how do i type red
 Automaton2000: just make sure your bot is not very good at it
 e1213: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's ok to have a nice day
 eulerscheZahl: and the bad news is i don't have bread
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 TheCodeKid123: Automaton2000 you are a bot
 Queuebee: :bread:
 Automaton2000: at the top of the leaderboard
 jacek: bread with beans?
 eulerscheZahl: well, toast
 TheCodeKid123: Beans and bread is delicious
 eulerscheZahl: afk buying some
 jrke: try bread butter
 TheCodeKid123: i got to go bye
 jrke: b-bye
 jacek: or butt breader
 Illedan: 2048 done euler?
 Illedan: Oh, new multi :D 
 Hjax: i was just talking to someone about an anime that has a lot of penguins 
 Angelbilly: hi guy i have a question do you how i can replace end="" in the return statement in python
 Illedan: Wood2 :tada: Just have to wait for 100&#160;% :zzz:
 eulerscheZahl: yes Illedani think it's ready
 Illedan: Cool, did you manage to code something to fill the board perfectly?
 eulerscheZahl: no, my solver is still pretty basic
 Illedan: Aiit, maybe I'll try later&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: right now i try to simplify the testcases for sokoban and put that one up for approval
 eulerscheZahl: do you think 2048 is ready? or should i keep it WIP for another week?
 Illedan: Give me a few days to test. I feel it might be very easy, but I might be wrong&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: :ok_hand:
 eulerscheZahl: the alternative: make it a puzzle too
 Illedan: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sourcecode.se/sokoban/levels">https://www.sourcecode.se/sokoban/levels</a>that "696" seems easy enough
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want another space maze
 jacek: noeone wants :v
 Hjax: in 2048 if you work out the seeds in the test cases cant you just precompute everything? 
 DomiKo: won't there be problem with slow output?
 eulerscheZahl: i even give the seed as input and it's all publicly available on github
 jacek: you timeout, Illedan
 Illedan: OH
 Hjax: so its definitely best to just solve offline then isnt it?
 Illedan: Pushing 
 eulerscheZahl: the point is: there is no way to hide the seeds. the contribution itself is always accessible and shows the validators
 eulerscheZahl: that's true for all optim problems sadly&#160;:(
 jacek: so it only takes that guy with meta mcts to get highest score?
 Hjax: i wonder if a 2048 multi is possible, both sides have a board, and choose where to place the tiles on their opponents board
 eulerscheZahl: you still need an offline solver that performs well. i'd love to force players to reach the scores purely online, it's just not possible by the design of CG
 eulerscheZahl: hm, that sounds interesting
 jacek: or maybe give seeds for 20 moves, then they need to query new seed for another 20 moves
 eulerscheZahl: but are 300 turns enough?
 eulerscheZahl: Jacek it's still either hardcoding (always the same list of seeds) or random validators
 Hjax: i recall someone made an AI that maliciously placed tiles in a 2048 game 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want a random score on submit
 Hjax: and the games ended pretty fast, even if you ran the minimax ai against it 
 jacek: like S Z tetris?
 eulerscheZahl: but now i optimized for 10k+ frames :cry:
 eulerscheZahl: and my sokoban multiplayer idea didn't find any friends
 eulerscheZahl: give an incomplete map. first you place some more walls, boxes, ... for the opponent
 jacek: maybe try it during contest
 Hjax: sounds like great escape 
 eulerscheZahl: then you swap boards and solve what the opponent gave you
 eulerscheZahl: great escape is played on a single board
 Hjax: true, but the idea of placing obstacles in such a way to slow your opponent down is similar 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Hjax: if struct doesnt come back soon, i might try to make a chess multi 
 jacek: 960?
 eulerscheZahl: shouldn't be to hard to code
 jacek: 420?
 eulerscheZahl: crazyhouse?
 Hjax: probably 960, or regular chess 
 Illedan: Sorry jacek xD
 Hjax: if we want to be true to the codingame spirit, we could do that new fog of war chess variant :P
 Allis: Fog of War?
 Hjax: ^^^
 Allis: Crazy timing there.
 jacek: kriegspiel?
 jacek: sounds german
 jacek: sounds like blitzkrieg
 jacek: :scream:
 Hjax: chess 960 takes away opening books, hard to say if thats good or not 
 Hjax: chess book theory is kind of interesting 
 eulerscheZahl: i saw a fog of war breakthrough on another websiteeach pawn running on a different instance of your program so they don't have a shared memory
 jacek: smits might not like it :v
 eulerscheZahl: and you have to guess what your opponent and teammates (=you) are doing while having a limited vision
 eulerscheZahl: an interesting idea. but not possible on CG
 Hjax: the fog of war chess variant is basically, you can see any square you can legally move a piece to, and the squares that have your pieces on it 
 jacek: on a bright side, my breakthrough bot won 5 games so far on littlegolem
 Hjax: so a knight can attack a queen without being seen 
 Allis: Or the King, for that matter.
 Illedan: Wood1 :tada:
 Hjax: the poor king is quite blind in fog of war chess
 jacek: imo i'd keep it classy, maybe 960
 Hjax: yeah i agree
 Hjax: a 960 engine can play normal chess unmodified, which means i could see mine have a depressingly low CCRL rating 
 jacek: you have chess engine?
 Hjax: i will if a multi shows up :P
 Hjax: ive written players for a few board games now, connect4, checkers, othello
 Hjax: no chess yet
 jacek: new programming language for CG plz <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tabloid.vercel.app/">https://tabloid.vercel.app/</a>
 Hjax: i think a problem would be if someone managed to get an existing strong engine into codingame 
 Hjax: probably gull
 Hjax: because its public domain and not super long
 JBM: looks like LOLCODE
 eulerscheZahl: that's exactly why no one ported chess yet
 eulerscheZahl: too well studied
 Hjax: god forbid someone figure out how to get stockfish in here
 Hjax: then its all over lol 
 jacek: well the same good be said for checkers
 jacek: could*
 Hjax: yeah i think cheating at a community multi is kind of unappealing 
 Hjax: its so small that mostly people will play to write their own stuff
 Scarfield: and if someone shoulf manage to do it, it can still be fun for the rest of us&#160;:)
 Scarfield: should*
 JFB: Hjax - it is really easy - simpy you have add new function (stockfish) to numpy - way foa admin to instal new version on CG - and use it in you bot&#160;:-) It is probably the only way to do it in 100 k CG limit&#160;;-)
 Hjax: you could probably get a compressed stockfish binary to be pretty tiny 
 Hjax: without NNUE 
 JBM: is it cheating if anyone can do it?
 JFB: JBM - I think that it is not cheating
 jacek: you already have stockfish ported to CG?
 JFB: Hjax - I think that binary smaller that 100 k is rather not possible - or at least very difficult 
 JFB: jacek - I do not think it is possible in 100 k
 MadKnight: what are u discussing&#160;?
 JFB: I suggest to include it in ne of the standard libraries in one of the CG languagest (for example numpy&#160;;-) )
 jacek: just as someone tried NN weight to put as python module
 JFB: MadKnight - theoritical disusion about implementing chess game on CG - and port the best known algo (stockfish ) to be 1st in the game&#160;;-)
 MadKnight: what's the problem to port stockfish&#160;?
 jacek: 100k code size
 MadKnight: is it longer&#160;?
 JFB: I think so&#160;:-)
 jacek: maybe cfish would be smaller
 Scarfield: couldnt you get something close to having a "time bank" on CG by having the possibility to "pass". If you output pass, the opponent cant move, since its not his turn, but get time to think as well, and will have to pass, untill the first player having passed actually moves
 JFB: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stockfishchess.org/download/">https://stockfishchess.org/download/</a>  - kompressed is 225 k - maybe it is possible? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Does this work for anyone, or just me?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wC89q3utXV-eBpCdGEFhB51A2osMvPGQ&amp;export=download">https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wC89q3utXV-eBpCdGEFhB51A2osMvPGQ&amp;export=download</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and the limit is 100k chars, which is more than 100kB with unicode
 eulerscheZahl: Google Drive can't scan this file for viruses.
 JFB: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: no, i don't want to download
 JBM: it could have evil viruses
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's just images in a zip file, gheesh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just making sure it works
 JFB: PatrickMcGinnisII - what it is&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Oh it's someone's collection of 1000 starwars images
 JFB: google say it for every download &gt; 100 MB .
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's wird the stuff found on goodle drive
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn can't spell, feel like crap
 Schwase: im on a hot streak for clash, double digit participations without a signle shortest mode
 Schwase: lets keep its up!!!!
 MayoDewitt: congrats bro
 PatrickMcGinnisII: should i play Penguins or install 8GB of memory, a 1TB SSD, and a new cpu cooler?
 MayoDewitt: how do you handle this last one
 MayoDewitt: lmao
 Schwase: i just jinxed it
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not scared of viruses. i'm just not in a mood to download it
 Schwase: mayo what?
 MayoDewitt: im in the game you just blowed up 
 Schwase: yeah dude ive played a lot of lobbies
 Barroso208: who wants to code with me?
 MayoDewitt: kk i understand
 Schwase: what was the puzzle?
 JFB: So c++ stockfish code is 560 kB. So it looks for me that I was wrong - port it to 100 k is not imposibble - it is only very difficult 
 Schwase: the brian one?
 jacek: penguins? im so alone in wood
 jacek: 2
 Illedan: :P
 Schwase: i strongly dislike when a clash puzzle creator feels the need to require use of a long type but only on one of the last few test cases and its only because of the operations that lead to the output that that data type is necessary and its not even part of the input
 Schwase: it was a ^2 problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is a Penguin board always 8x8?
 jacek: eeyup
 MadKnight: why is it so long JFB&#160;?
 jacek: thats what she said
 TheCodeKid123: Hey guys im back
 jacek: why are you red TheCodeKid123
 jacek: sus
 AntiSquid: hi TheCodeKid123
 Schwase: when you get first in an 8 player shortest CoC lobby because no one likes to read the actual problem statement and so they all get 60/70% while you take your time writing a 200+ character code 
 TheCodeKid123: i am confused
 Laminator: non-python problems lol
 LastRick: ^
 LastRick: Meanwhile Dart users: Write 200 characters of code, only able to parse inputs
 Schwase: java and dart are similar when it comes to usefulness in code golf. theyre not
 LastRick: Yep. Always have to switch to Python on shortest just to have a chance at winning
 Laminator: If you're going to switch for shortest, I would suggest ruby or bash. Optimal code is unbeatable by python. 
 LastRick: ruby for sure. But python I know by heart (ruby not so much) and that's enough to at least make it competitive.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: If I don't have a penguin ID because there are 0 on the board, how do I move one on the board with an unknown id? wth
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all penguins should be input with -1,-1 or something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do i have to pull the id from the action list, or just use the next posible id #?
 LeRenard: comment ca se fait que dot &amp; boxes il y a plus le lien de telechargment
 LeRenard: erreur de detinataire
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh penguins don't have unique ids across all players
 JBM: oui comment ca se fait hein
 sagya: bou nos dias
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, won my first penguin game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now I submit and quit
 jacek: and they say there are no games for linux
 JackTheRipper18: ohhhh
 JackTheRipper18: bro I just spent 15 minutes trying to figure out wtf I did wrong but I forgot to change smthn in my Vector2 - operator&#160;:(
 TheCodeKid123: hey guys 
 TheCodeKid123: check this out
 TheCodeKid123: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tynker.com/code/project/vfs/project/5f737c0bd67d87731106b544/index.html">https://www.tynker.com/code/project/vfs/project/5f737c0bd67d87731106b544/index.html</a>
 JackTheRipper18: why is the speed in pod racing non lienar
 JackTheRipper18: if you move at speed 1 you move 1/frame in each axis.
 JackTheRipper18: but at speed 100, it's 464/frame
 JackTheRipper18: 466**
 TheCodeKid123: huh
 TheCodeKid123: :confused:
 JackTheRipper18: And it takes a few seconds to reach it's max speed, and boost actually isn't any faster, it just accelerates to max speed quicker.
 TheCodeKid123: what you talkin about?
 JackTheRipper18: in coders strike back.
 TheCodeKid123: oh
 2ndwolf: OH TNX FOR THE INFO JACK
 2ndwolf: sorry caps
 TheCodeKid123: check out the website i chatted
 TheCodeKid123: plz
 JackTheRipper18: Yeah, I want to set up some algorithm to predict enemy's position so I'm recording some info on movement/frame
 TheCodeKid123: i am so lost
 JackTheRipper18: it takes 32 frames to reach max speed.
 TheCodeKid123: ok
 JackTheRipper18: Check out coders strike back it's a mini game.
 JackTheRipper18: or game I mean.
 2ndwolf: haha I was thinking the same thing but figured just bumping him while I'm close with a good angle would be enough
 TheCodeKid123: who?
 JackTheRipper18: If i can predict his position, I could also do like dot math for his position, and the checkpoints, and do a check if I should avoid collision or knock him off course.
 TheCodeKid123: check out this website     <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tynker.com/code/project/vfs/project/5f737c0bd67d87731106b544/index.html">https://www.tynker.com/code/project/vfs/project/5f737c0bd67d87731106b544/index.html</a>
 JackTheRipper18: I'm good.
 TheCodeKid123: come on it all about me
 JackTheRipper18: I clicked it anyway cuz my VPN was on, maybe make whatever project that is public.
 2ndwolf: yeah but I was thinking of simpler, conditions
 JackTheRipper18: Yeah, I wanna try and optimize the fuck out of this game just for fun.
 2ndwolf: what league u in
 JackTheRipper18: See if it would be smarter to avoid collision or knock him of course, math to see what angle I should bump him from to get him the furthest away from the checkpoint etc.
 remi6: To me it says " Oops, it seems our codeblocks didn't connect", TheCodeKid123.
 JackTheRipper18: I'm just in bronze atm, I could probably beat it but I'm building a ton of shit rn because at first I was just focusing on making it work well enough to win, and it was an unorganized mess.
 JackTheRipper18: rn I'm working on a check to see which checkpoint has the greatest distance, to determine when I should boost.
 2ndwolf: it seems dist/10 + a couple things is enough to be close to boss in league 3 bronze
 TheCodeKid123: It works
 JackTheRipper18: That's because your on your account.
 JackTheRipper18: it's probably private.
 Zenoscave: MadKnight they need to know about -3vel
 TheCodeKid123: no my teachers could see it too
 JackTheRipper18: idk
 Astrobytes: don't overthink Coders Strike Back til you get to Gold
 Astrobytes: lol, don't listen to ol' pewpewpew over there
 TheCodeKid123: how do you type in red
 Zenoscave: it hust is red when someone mentions your name
 TheCodeKid123: oh
 Zenoscave: it only turns red for the name mentioned
 Zenoscave: -3vel is the key
 Zenoscave: or is that outdated?
 TheCodeKid123: I put a new update that says TheCodeKid123
 Astrobytes: I didn't use it but it works yeah, insta-gold
 TheCodeKid123: it do not work
 TheCodeKid123: Astrobytes can you please help me with this please
 TheCodeKid123: ~~help~~
 Astrobytes: Nope, going offline, sorry buddy
 Astrobytes: gn all
 TheCodeKid123: come on :rage::rage:
 Zenoscave: gn Astrobytes
 TheCodeKid123: please
 TheCodeKid123: help
 TheCodeKid123: help
 TheCodeKid123: help
 JackTheRipper18: I'll just get to gold then, I'll waste my time optimizing then&#160;:)
 TheCodeKid123: help
 Zenoscave: TheCodeKid123 please stop spamming
 TheCodeKid123: help
 JackTheRipper18: Setting up a good Vector2 class was worth it though.
 TheCodeKid123: then help me
 JackTheRipper18: wtf do u need help with
 Zenoscave: that's certainly not gonna happen if you keep acting so.
 TheCodeKid123: Zenoscave i will stop but please help
 JackTheRipper18: With what
 TheCodeKid123: typing red chat
 JackTheRipper18: that's A: definitely not urgent wtf, and that was B: explained 50 times, read up.
 JackTheRipper18: I'm not gonna tell u again.
 Zenoscave: I already told you. If you type someone's nickname it shows up red to them. not anyone else
 TheCodeKid123: oh
 jacek: to think i could have been mod
 TheCodeKid123: Zenoscave is this red?
 Zenoscave: It won't work if you say your own name. Yes it is red.
 TheCodeKid123: oh thx
 Zenoscave: jacek, did you decline?
 TheCodeKid123: jacek i don't think so
 TheCodeKid123: you should of accepted
 jacek: yes, i troll too much
 Zenoscave: fair.
 Zenoscave: MK 2.0
 TheCodeKid123: uhhhh why jacek
 TheCodeKid123:  Zenoscave i will not spam
 JackTheRipper18: how old are you
 2ndwolf: he said he was 8
 JackTheRipper18: makes sense.
 2ndwolf: that said now that I know all my code was scrap I'm not sure how to optimize my csb bot not
 Zenoscave: ezpz -3vel
 JackTheRipper18: wym -3vel
 Zenoscave: (tx, ty) = (cx - 3*vx, cy-3*vy)
 Hjax: hes talking about the oneliner csb solution 
 Hjax: gets you to gold if you just move according to the equation he just mentioned
 JackTheRipper18: what are those variables tho
 Hjax: targetx, targety, currentx, xvelocity, currenty, yvelocity
 Zenoscave: :zipper_mouth:
 JackTheRipper18: how's that a one liner if you have to calculate x&amp;y Velocity though?
 Zenoscave: hjax simply meant simple statement with no heavy logic or understanding by oneliner
 Zenoscave: If you want to know why that works look into this.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732">https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732</a>
 2ndwolf: so I gotta compute thrust from reversing this thing?
 2ndwolf: omg great resource thanks
 Zenoscave: nope just thrust 100 always. ezpz
 Hjax: my csb is rank 458 gold
 Hjax: 20 lines
 2ndwolf: hahaha
 Hjax: close enough to one line :D 
 Zenoscave: the -3vel accounts for over shooting
 JackTheRipper18: Mine's super over engineered atm, mostly just for convenience though.
 JackTheRipper18: I've got a big ass Vector2 class.
 Hjax: i could golf it down a bit more 
 Zenoscave: faster you go the sooner you stop
 JackTheRipper18: Wait really\
 Hjax: i could probably get it under 10 lines 
 cg000: EZPZ
 JackTheRipper18: I could get it to one line&#160;:)
 2ndwolf: and 10 functions XD
 Hjax: functions? who uses those 
 JackTheRipper18: Nah, just a lot of semi colons in that one line.
 2ndwolf: ok I almost won against bronze 3 boss with (destX destY 100)
 JackTheRipper18: oh I always beat the boss.
 JackTheRipper18: Just sometimes issues in the arena.
 2ndwolf: same
 JackTheRipper18: I'm still setting up rn tho.
 2ndwolf: but it's absurd
 2ndwolf: I'm about a 100 px behind with just console.log
 JackTheRipper18: speed is weirdly inconsistent.
 JackTheRipper18: earlier I got 460 smthn
 JackTheRipper18: this time I got 661.
 JackTheRipper18: ohh
 JackTheRipper18: if you move on solely one axis you move at a rate of 661/frame
 JackTheRipper18: if you move  diagonally it's 466/frame
 JackTheRipper18: probably smthn to do with Vector normalizing.
 2ndwolf: :O
 Zenoscave: Hjax you still on?
 JackTheRipper18: it takes 38 frames to completely decelerate
 JackTheRipper18: 2860.6058798792956
 JackTheRipper18: Although it's definitely not efficient, it's cool to look at, if you set thrust to 0 the second the dist&lt;2861 you'll be 100% stopped the same frame you reach the checkpoint, as long as you use angles &lt;4
 JackTheRipper18: &gt;4**
 JackTheRipper18: (Also if your checkpoints are too close together it'll break, definitely needs a check for that.)
 2ndwolf: omg lol I just won ~12000th to from decelerating ~200th just from decelerating when the angle isn't right
 2ndwolf: damnit can't edit XD
 2ndwolf: yeah I've stopped stopping my pod because of that
 JackTheRipper18: It's pretty easy to correct it
 Hjax: whats up Zenoscave
 JackTheRipper18: Just check if it hasn't accelerated in more than 2 frames, if so set a condition that makes it thrust.
 2ndwolf: yeah
 JackTheRipper18: Rn I think it would be ideal, to set desiredDestination to 2861, away from the checkpoint, towards the player.
 JackTheRipper18: So it never decelerates, but when sliding to change target pos it will trigger the checkpoint.
 Zenoscave: Do you shield in CSB yet? I'm interested in comparing 20 - liners
 Zenoscave: ^ Hjax
 MadKnight: Zenoscave 20-liners that do what&#160;?
 Zenoscave: csb ofc.
 MadKnight: gold&#160;?
 Zenoscave: yeh
 MadKnight: in python or c++&#160;?
 Zenoscave: seeing how far up I can get in gold on a smurf. ruby
 MadKnight: simple movement simulation is allowed&#160;?
 MadKnight: no collision
 Zenoscave: no simu
 Zenoscave: just steering maths
 MadKnight: just the pos += vel
 Insufficient: i have rank 400 or so with an 80 line heuristic python 3 script no simulation or anything
 Zenoscave: a bit more
 MadKnight: try my formula Zenoscave
 cg000: -3v? or pos +=
 darkhorse64: 20 lines is too much code
 MadKnight: wait are u doing the optimization one&#160;?
 Zenoscave: no
 Zenoscave: just csb
 MadKnight: then try my formula
 MadKnight: PM
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 2ndwolf: 120 ranks from boosting at a different moment
 MadKnight: Zenoscave u got the formula working&#160;?
 Zenoscave: not yet
 SeeJay: pls share your code
 SuperN3rdy: So feeling dumb on this 7-segment scanner could anyone help&gt;
 SuperN3rdy:&#160;?*
 Dementio: hello, when you submit a solution to a puzzle.. is the score influenced by the efficiency of the solution or it just sees if all tests are passed
 SuperN3rdy: the 1st one 
 Dementio: ty
 SuperN3rdy: No worries I only found out because of rewriting my code without the extra loop i had
 Majeck: Is there any way to know an account's age?
 CosmicStudios: I can only do one testcase without messing up the others, does anyone know how to fix that?
 SuperN3rdy: depends on what your trying to do.
 SuperN3rdy: Is this for the 7-segement scanner
 LastRick: @Majeck, I noted that if I look at your profile, in the tab Ranking, the graph has tooltips which show the date that your ranking moved. So I am guessing you joined not too long before that
 CosmicStudios: Descending Mountains  
 SuperN3rdy: Thats the one with the ship right?
 CosmicStudios: yup
 2ndwolf: I've seen him ask that question before
 2ndwolf: who is majeck
 2ndwolf: thought bot for a moment sorry
 CosmicStudios: I did test case one then one change to testcase 2 messes up testcase one
 SuperN3rdy: would have to see your code
 CosmicStudios: and I meant it was The Descent 
 2ndwolf: look for the highest number in array O_O
 CosmicStudios: I thought test case one would stay completed
 SuperN3rdy: it will if you dont hard code any numbers 
 2ndwolf: nah you have to validate every test case with one version of your code
 SuperN3rdy: my guess is you are hard coding the highest one
 SuperN3rdy: so when you change test cases you are changing the code
 CosmicStudios: oh that makes it harder&#160;:\
 SuperN3rdy: its not that bad after you understand the trick to it, Its only a couple lines of code
 CosmicStudios: oh thanks =D
 Majeck: Thanks @LastRick
 SuperN3rdy: I am completely lost on the scanner guessing i need to use regex but not sure how i would even start it 
 LastRick: @SuperN3rdy, the one by tutbalin? If so, I solved it without regex (I rarely use that) so I can probably help
 Majeck: @2ndwolf I'm not a bot, but you have a sharp memory!
 SuperN3rdy: @lastrick Yes I am lost on where to even start
 SuperN3rdy: Does this chat not link to the full discord?
 LastRick: Maybe. I don't know, I don't do discord. 
 LastRick: So the best hint I can probably give you is I used a HashMap to solve it. Are you familiar with those?
 SuperN3rdy: Yea I know hashmaps I am doing this in Python 3 though I think they call them dictionaries
 SuperN3rdy: Take it you did it in Javascript or C++
 LastRick: Dart. So with that in mind, is there a value or expression you could store for every number 0 through 9?
 SuperN3rdy: Trying to think
 SuperN3rdy: I know there is but not sure what that would be. Was thinking I could add each set of 9 to a hash but that seems a bit much 
 SuperN3rdy: maybe make a set of objects with the 3 lines 
 SuperN3rdy: something like {"one"&#160;: {
 LastRick: You're really close. Maybe there's a way you could change the three-line ASCII number into a usable key. 
 SuperN3rdy: line1: " _ ",line2: "| |",line3: "|_|"
 SuperN3rdy: }
 LastRick: That's close! Keep going&#160;:)
 SuperN3rdy: OK so I would need to flip that so its the key instead of the value
 SuperN3rdy: hmmmm
 LastRick: Yes
 SuperN3rdy: OK I am going to go read for a min to see if I can get this
 LastRick: Best of luck!
 SuperN3rdy: I am not the best with Hashmaps I hated in javascript too
 MadKnight: &gt;  Does this chat not link to the full discord? no it's a separate chat system
 SuperN3rdy: OK thanks @MadKnight
 SuperN3rdy: was looking for my chat in the main discord and could not find it
 MadKnight: are u doing the chuck norris&#160;?
 MadKnight: or file extensions&#160;?
 SuperN3rdy: No the 7 segment scanner by tutubalin
 MadKnight: ooh
 SuperN3rdy: I am on the right track now that I see what I need to do. Also Thanks for that @LastRick
 LastRick: :thumbsup:
 SuperN3rdy: so would I have all 3 lines on one line for the key some thing like " _ | ||_|"
 SuperN3rdy: so it would not look like it but if I added all there lines together like that I would get the value
 LastRick: You got it.
 SuperN3rdy: dam TBH i was doing some complex ass regex for each one that is some much easier lol
 SuperN3rdy: Guess thats what I get for not coding for a half a year after school
 LastRick: Yeah, you figure out quickly here if you're working really hard on a problem and it's level is Easy, probably a better way to do it.
 SuperN3rdy: Really makes me hate myself :joy:
 LastRick: Keep at it, you'll be flying in no time
 SuperN3rdy: Thanks \
 LastRick: My pleasure
 Majeck: Quick annoying question: What's the command to send text to the error stream in python3?
 Majeck: In C# for example it's Console.Error.WriteLine()
 SuperN3rdy: i think its sys.stderr.write()
 Majeck: Yep! Thanks!
 MadKnight: what are u doing majeck&#160;?
 Harrogin: first day on this site. clash of code is awesome!
 GeniusProgrammer7720: hello
 _ZiGZ_: hello
 JackTheRipper18: Bro this is so satisfying to watch.
 SuperN3rdy: Woohoo only took me an hour but its done. Thanks Again @LastRick
 LastRick: No problem. On to the next one!
 SuperN3rdy: Yep plan on doing every one of these easy ones before I move on.
 SuperN3rdy: The stupid spacing kept messing me up
 SuperN3rdy: Got a 100% on it too
 LastRick: Good to hear. Yep, once you get past the HashMap concept, it's basically a string parsing puzzle. If you like that kind of stuff, go try an ASCII art one.
 SuperN3rdy: O I didn't like it lol but after I got the dictionary done the function only took me like 10 mins. I just need to remember that hashmaps/dictionary is a thing
 LastRick: hah hah
 LastRick: Sorry, HashMap, I forgot you existed
 SuperN3rdy: Yea it's so useful but I always forget it and end up using just list/array and write a bunch of code to compare which is dumb of me. But when I 1st started coding I don't think hashmaps was a thing back in 2000
 SuperN3rdy: this is like my 4th time restarting programming
 JackTheRipper18: Now I have to program a dot product function for my vector class lets go.
 LastRick: Welcome back!&#160;:) 
 SuperN3rdy: good luck
 LinhT.Nguyen: alo ae
 LinhT.Nguyen: sup guys
 LastRick: hey
 LinhT.Nguyen: yo
 JackTheRipper18: The way Coders strike back does angles is so annoying.
 JackTheRipper18: why 180 to -180 that's not how angles work
 LinhT.Nguyen: gotta do what we gotta do bro
 SuperN3rdy:&#160;?
 LinhT.Nguyen: you dont tel clients they are stupid
 SuperN3rdy: I don't even know what you was talking about and that is confusing to me lol
 SuperN3rdy: Well that's my night ladies and gents hopefully see you all tomorrow.
 LastRick: Later
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: lol I was just promoted to wood 1 of the great escape and my bot literally just moves in one direction
 Nickkname: every body have been through that lol

 SocMB: hello everyone
 Wontonimo: not everyone says hello back, but I did
 Wontonimo: i submitted a bot to platinum rift ep 1
 Wontonimo: a random bot is beating wood 2 and wood 1
 Wontonimo: lol
 DialFrost: lol
 SocMB: is platinum rift hard?
 Wontonimo: you've got to know about dictionaries or associative arrays
 Wontonimo: and random numbers
 Wontonimo: otherwise it is pretty straight forward to get out of wood league
 Wontonimo: beyond that, idk.  haven't done any more
 Ajaiy: Can anyone suggest me a hard problem to start with? I already finished CGX formatter btw

 C26_1: ok
 Ajinkya_J: anyone 
 Mortis_666: hi
 DialFrost: hai
 Firez69: i need help
 Firez69: im at the mad pod racing and my line is "if next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 90 or next_checkpoint_angle &lt; -90 "
 Firez69: is there a invalid syntax?
 PolentaEater: depends on the language&#160;:)
 Firez69: its on phyton
 Firez69: 3
 Firez69: does any of you know a idea how to fix it?
 PolentaEater: does the "if" end with a colon ":"&#160;? is the following block indented? 
 Firez69: do i have to wirte after else this(":") too?
 PolentaEater: if condition: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e799bfc5-c932-4a23-bc96-071850b0cf38">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e799bfc5-c932-4a23-bc96-071850b0cf38</a>
 Firez69: im still confused
 C26_1: ok
 PolentaEater: mmm perhaps you should start with some basic tutorial first
 Firez69: okay
 C26_1: In python, the if statement is called branch-flow
 C26_1: It will change the flow of a program depend on some condition
 C26_1: To know if a line of code is in the if-block then we need to indent it 4 space (default). The number of space when indent has to be consistent
 C26_1: The structure of a if-statement in Python might look like this:
 C26_1: if (condition): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a82637d-a116-49d6-9bce-76258f536c5d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a82637d-a116-49d6-9bce-76258f536c5d</a>

 derjack: no need for ( ) in python
 C26_1: @derjack, yeah you're right, but I internationally write that becuase I don't wany any confusing for others who learn other programming language or someone who is completely new to programming language
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: Guys
 C26_1: We have someone who write the description of Python that looks something like this
 Ajaiy: like what
 Uljahn: like this
 C26_1: Python is a high programming language for multi thread, by Guido van Rossum created and firstly introduced in 1991. Python is designed with advantages of 'easy to read, easy to learn and easy to remember', very useful for newbie
 C26_1: Python is widely used in machine learning and AI. The structure of Python can also minimize how many keys did the coder has to type in compared to other programming language
 C26_1: In July, 2018, van Rossum has resigned (or not doing his job anymore) in Python community after working for 30 years
 Uljahn: what's your point? don't flood the chat pls
 Jerrasterix: he doesn't have coordinates 
 C26_1: Does this paragraph talk about true description about Python
 C26_1: I know a lot of people will hat Python
 Jerrasterix: :rolling_eyes:
 C26_1: But cmon, if you hate them then you must have at least 1 reason for that
 C26_1: So I translate this paragraph to discuss
 C26_1: hate*
 Jerrasterix: Its duck typed, terribly slow, interpreted, have to wait for 1000 loc to execute before it lands on a f**king indentation error, where It looks its correct but I messed up with tab and space 
 Jerrasterix: I could go on list it.....
 Uljahn: breaking news
 xangeliczx: breaking news?
 C26_1: breaking news
 Jerrasterix: he is jokin' 
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: This is another paragraph
 C26_1: that is so wrong about Python
 C26_1: Look
 Jerrasterix: CAN YOU STOP FLODDING THE CHAT please....
 Jerrasterix: enough with python nonsense 
 Jerrasterix: *FLOODING
 C26_1: Python is 100% dynamic programming language with automated memory, so it is the same as Perl, Ruby, Scheme, SmallTalk, Tcl. Python is an open-source project by Python Software Foundation manage
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: enough with the nonsense
 C26_1: about how Python is introduced in Wikipedia
 C26_1: bye bye
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: For those of you don't know about automated memory, that means you can assigned a variable with only values and don't need to type in the data type of that variable (like int, float, arr, vector, class, inf, None) 
 Uljahn: hey, nobody asked for this
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: I'm out
 Jerrasterix: unfortunately at the moment everyone in chat knows what it is&#160;!!
 Uljahn: also i think in python syntax errors are handled by parser before the code execution
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/</a>
 Jerrasterix: Then why did a final ML (changed from ipynb to py to run it in a server), I made some last minute changes using notepad and ran it, It didn't tell that I messed up till about 3 hrs later
 Jerrasterix: I had to re run it again :disappointed:
 Uljahn: you mean jupyter notebook?
 NotANick: Can I sync my IDE with your IDE? If I can how? Because I feel way more comfortable with my IDE.
 NotANick: If not, can I write an extension for this? Is it legal?
 Uljahn: never used it, but you can look at this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359</a> or that<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614/113">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614/113</a>
 NotANick: thank you very much
 Jerrasterix: well I did it in jupyter notebook but I converted it to py script for a final run in a server 
 Jerrasterix: idk how to run cells in a jupyter notebook thru cli

 Yytsi: lately the chat panel opens itself upon starting a clash of code game. why does it happen and how can I turn it off?
 SATANSPAWN: kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
 Yytsi: interestingly it happens about 50% of the time
 Yytsi: maybe it's gone now
 DoggoIsCoolerThanJack: hellooo
 LazyfromDiscord: Yytsi you are good
 Jerrasterix: If I am right, you can disable chat Yytsi 
 Jerrasterix: but I forgot how to do it...
 Jerrasterix: you have to append something to the url
 eulerscheZahl: there is ?disableChat which you can add to the URL. not sure if it works for clashes as the website sometimes does a total reload
 eulerscheZahl: seems to work, at least for puzzles
 TDFFF: hello
 eulerscheZahl: We're excited to announce that the prizes are finally ready and we're starting to ship them out next week![...] The event is Russian AI Cup 2020
 eulerscheZahl: they haven't forgotten it&#160;:)
 derjack: 2020?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it took them a while
 eulerscheZahl: i'm also waiting for a topcoder tshirt that I won in April
 eulerscheZahl: as a rule of thumb: the smaller the organizer, the faster the prize delivery
 Bob_Rocks: I'm finally bronze league in Ghost in the Cell
 Bob_Rocks: 😤
 eulerscheZahl: took you so long that it's not Ghost in the Cell anymore
 eulerscheZahl: Cyborg Uprising
 <b>**eulerscheZahl suggested: Exp(ansion)</b>
 Bob_Rocks: Yeah I saw 
 Bob_Rocks: I thought it was weird
 Bob_Rocks: but I'm still gonna call it Ghost in the CEll
 Bob_Rocks: Cell*
 eulerscheZahl: so do i
 derjack: and im gonna call the cops
 Bob_Rocks: 😱
 Bob_Rocks: why
 derjack: the copyright cops
 Bob_Rocks: lol
 Bob_Rocks: is it actually a copyright problem?
 Bob_Rocks: is Ghost in the Cell too close to Ghost in the Shell
 Bob_Rocks: I mean I guess
 eulerscheZahl: at least CG is worried about it, maybe a bit paranoid
 eulerscheZahl: that's why they remained a lot of games recently
 Bob_Rocks: Is that why they also changed Coders strike back?
 Bob_Rocks: 😔
 eulerscheZahl: looking at the list of games, they aren't even done yet
 eulerscheZahl: game of drones (game of thrones) was on their list too
 Bob_Rocks: bruh
 Bob_Rocks: well that's tough
 eulerscheZahl: we still have <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4</a> as a community contribution

 TimberStalker: I just got a 66% score even though i used the exact same solution as someone else who got 100%
 eulerscheZahl: i doubt it
 Westicles: minesweeper?
 eulerscheZahl: share both your and the other solution
 eulerscheZahl: minesweeper only has 0% and 100%
 TimberStalker: Its not minesweeper, its CoC
 eulerscheZahl: can you paste your solution here?
 eulerscheZahl: and do you remember parts of the task statement?
 TimberStalker: yes
 TimberStalker: Should i use pastebin or something?
 eulerscheZahl: just here in the chat
 eulerscheZahl: let the magic happen
 TimberStalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50a548b5-09f8-4009-9010-da181766c313">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50a548b5-09f8-4009-9010-da181766c313</a>
 TimberStalker: cool
 TimberStalker: Basically its an input string in the format of hh:mm:ss, and you need to compare them to see if a flight was delayed or early or on time
 TimberStalker: uh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/887007ead6771a429d9f07b03d0475c5ebefa2">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/887007ead6771a429d9f07b03d0475c5ebefa2</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you failed the 3rd validator
 TimberStalker: why?
 eulerscheZahl: 23:23:2324:00:00
 eulerscheZahl: DELAYED
 TimberStalker: I see the problem
 TimberStalker: I didnt multiply the hour enough
 TimberStalker: stupid
 eulerscheZahl: replace 360 by 60*24 and it's green
 TimberStalker: one zero is the difference between first and last
 TimberStalker: Question, for the Quest thing, are there any more bubbles that require you to win shortest code clashes other than the first one?
 eulerscheZahl: win 3 reverse, win 3 shortest, solve 3 in a row, solve with 3 different languages, reach top1000 of the CoC leaderboard, win 3 clashes in a row
 TimberStalker: good because i only got one shortest clash to magic my way through with c#.
 eulerscheZahl: you can pick another language if you want
 TimberStalker: I dont really now code tricks in other languages
 eulerscheZahl: time to learn then
 TheAlps: Hello&#160;:)
 Lavanda: Hello
 ProMikeSundays: hi
 ProMikeSundays: what's your opinion on reverse vs fastest vs shortest
 Lavanda: all the same
 TheAlps: :D
 TimberStalker: shortest sucks because my main language is c#
 jacek: use shorter language
 TheAlps: Hey i am new in codind field and somehow i noticed that i dont enjoy coding in javascript and css and html so front end,  but i like coding in c, c++ and java,  which way should i follow&#160;? Any suggestions&#160;?
 jacek: does anyone enjoys coding javascript ever? :thinking:
 TheAlps: Ahahahah thats a general problem&#160;?&#160;:)
 jacek: java? so maybe android. or try similar language like c#
 Wontonimo: for those who care the epic game "while true learn" is available for free <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/while-true-learn">https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/while-true-learn</a>

 TheAlps: Oh i can try c # as well&#160;:)
 jacek: machine learning eh
 TheAlps:&#160;;
 TheAlps: Thank you&#160;:)
 Spaceyyy: what?
 g19lok: how do i slow down standard output stream to turn slower
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: in what game?
 g19lok: doing mad pod racing just dont understand the thrust mechanic and slowing down for turns
 Wontonimo: reduce thrust to slow down
 Wontonimo: paste your main print statment here.  if you have multiple print statments, just paste one
 g19lok: thats what im having proplems with :3
 Wontonimo: you can't copy paste code from the IDE to here?
 eulerscheZahl: "if you have multiple"that would sound like a problem on its own
 g19lok:     print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 100")
 Wontonimo: see that last number 100&#160;?  that is your thrust
 g19lok: no only one
 g19lok: ive been messing around tryna slow it down at the turns to beat boss
 Wontonimo: you can reduce that to not apply so much thrust
 Wontonimo: and what have you come up with so far?
 g19lok: im pausing to see the game info, boss is dropping to 50 right at the next checkpoint to turn sharp. im having problems figuring THAT out.
 g19lok: slowing down at turn
 g19lok: mid game lol
 g19lok: but hes starting with 100 like me just changing mid turn
 g19lok: and going back to 100 
 Wontonimo: okay, so what data do you have in your program that you can use to make a decision to slow down?
 Wontonimo: you have coordinates of a few things and also angles and stuff
 g19lok: i have no earthly idea :sweat:
 g19lok: ive been trying i promise
 jacek: oO
 jacek: do you print 100 always?
 Wontonimo: okay, so the angle show tells how away from true your pod is facing from the checkpoint
 Wontonimo: +5 means pretty dead on,
 Wontonimo: -98 or +87 means nearly right angle
 Wontonimo: so something like abs(angle) &lt; 90
 Wontonimo: will let you know if your pod is pointing more towards the next checkpoint than just perpendicular
 g19lok: yes i print 100 always 
 g19lok: idk how to change the 100 to 50 thrust
 Wontonimo: if angle low:
 Wontonimo: ^^ that's pseudo code, you have to translate that into the programming language you are using
 g19lok: :astonished:
 g19lok: JAW DROP

 g19lok: smh
 jacek: what language is that oO
 g19lok: it was right infront of MEEE
 g19lok: python3
 5DN1L: that's not python3
 g19lok: im using python3. thats the pseudo code algorithm it says
 5DN1L: ok
 5DN1L: do you know how to turn the pseudo code into python3 code?
 g19lok: no&#160;:/
 g19lok: im entirely new 
 Wontonimo: pretty close actually
 Wontonimo: but use abs instead of &lt; then &gt;
 Wontonimo: like this
 5DN1L: g19lok You probably should start with learning writing simple python3 code first
 Wontonimo: if abs(nextCheckpointAngle) &gt; 90 then: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9fdb282a-c4bc-43ca-8060-0ebe2fb5408b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9fdb282a-c4bc-43ca-8060-0ebe2fb5408b</a>
 Wontonimo: I agree with 5DN1L
 lucas0: Hello, is there a hotkey to 'play all testcases'?
 5DN1L: g19lok We can tell you all about how to pass the boss in Mad Pod Racing, but you won't be able to write the code
 lucas0: and to sumit solution?
 g19lok: this is confusing, should i use something simpler. maybe Bash... i just chose it thinking it looked a bit simpler
 Wontonimo: i'd argue bash is harder unless you are a bash expert
 g19lok: this is the place to learn all this isnt it?
 g19lok: 'go'?
 struct: I would never use bash here
 lucas0: start with python and when you learn a bit of bash you won't need much more
 lucas0: Hello, is there a hotkey to 'play all testcases'?
 struct: ctrl enter?
 Wontonimo: press button?
 lucas0: oh thanks
 5DN1L: g19lok, this is the place to learn, yes, but not the place to learn the very basic
 lucas0: any for the submission?
 struct: ctrl shift enter to test all sorry
 struct: dont think so
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+shift+p to see all shortcuts
 lucas0: ctrl+shift+p gives me the printing overlay
 eulerscheZahl: wait, just ctrl+p
 lucas0: that gives me the browser printing overlay haha
 eulerscheZahl: for VS Code it's ctrl+shift+P
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 struct: you must have ide selected
 struct: to press ctrl + p
 lucas0: it is selected
 lucas0: im using opera
 struct: right click ide
 eulerscheZahl: i get this on CTRL+P<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/A5sxD2J">https://imgur.com/a/A5sxD2J</a>

 diellatseng: the goal is to print unique square number btw
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea. just wanted to mention that JS tends to sort alphabetically instead of numerically
 diellatseng: true, I forgot to verify that... the first few cases all have the correct answer though, just that mine have spaces around...
 5DN1L: That's the default way of how js prints array I guess
 5DN1L: If you want to print it some other way, you have to code it yourself I think
 ZugZug: what's this&#160;?
 5DN1L: this is a chatroom
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, what's this?

 Nikita499: :frowning2:

 Wontonimo: no way!  You just watch the right tiktok and then you know the trick.  it's that easy
 Wontonimo: just keep scrolling tiktok, don't practice.
 eulerscheZahl: confession time: i've never been on tictoc
 Wontonimo: that's more like a brag

 Wontonimo: this is a public chat rotten_manbe respectful, no spamming, talk about coding or codingame (mostly), stay on topic (mostly)
 jacek: does this chat ever get offtopic?
 AntiSquid: never
 Westicles: that's why there needs to be an english chat
 AntiSquid: #in is english
 Westicles: ooh look, a hii
 AntiSquid: might be a typo, but someone should ban just to be safe
 struct: It has bean dealt with
 jacek: Automaton2000 what language is this
 Automaton2000: i'm tempted to try to get the answer
 struct: bean :p
 AntiSquid: ok Mister
 IamTheSmix: Hello Community, 
 IamTheSmix: is there any good game to practice python 
 IamTheSmix: recent ones 
 jacek: clash of bots? its just heuristics, bunch of ifs and print
 TimothyAlexisVass: IamTheSmix What level of Python are you at?
 IamTheSmix: advanced
 AntiSquid: then any game
 AntiSquid: advanced means you can do pretty much anything in python
 struct: ghost in the cell has python bot at the top
 struct: its heuristic heavy too 
 jacek: well except for heavy calculations fast
 AntiSquid: why not spring challenge 2021, it's heuristic heavy
 IamTheSmix: thanks
 IamTheSmix:&#160;:)
 struct: ghost in the cell was renamed to cyborg uprising
 struct: I would just watch replay and pick a game that you think you will enjoy
 AntiSquid: what's the new "budding examiner" achievement? 
 5DN1L: After you solve a puzzle, click RESULTS on the left of the IDE screen, then click LEARN FROM THE BEST CODERS, and rank the solutions
 Cruiser18: Is it possible to use multiple files for a solution in CodinGame, or does a solution have to be one long super file?
 jacek: 1 file
 struct: I use local ide and the run a script to merge it into 1
 jacek: there are some tools to convert multiple files into one
 Cruiser18: Damn. Alright then. Guess I'll just have to live with that. :P
 struct: which language are you using?
 Cruiser18: C#
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger</a>
 struct: Never tried it
 struct: so not sure how it works
 AntiSquid: so you're prescribing him an experimental tool&#160;?!
 struct: yes
 Westicles: can someone take all the chats, translate into english as needed, and put them on one channel?  thanks!
 Filippo-Fracascia: hey all, is there any graphic programmer?
 AntiSquid: what do you mean
 Filippo-Fracascia: vulkan,openGL etc.
 AntiSquid: does webpage UI count&#160;?
 jacek: people would use graphic engine/framework like unity than 'program' in opengl themselves
 Filippo-Fracascia: well, I guess so. Three.js?
 Abdelho: hello
 struct: well I did use three js before but im not very familiar with it
 AntiSquid: what is your actual question
 AntiSquid: is it really broad enough to cover so many topics
 Filippo-Fracascia: just wanted to know if there's some graphic programmer...it's a specific role
 AntiSquid: specific role defined by whom&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i agree with what jacek wrote btw
 Filippo-Fracascia: Ok, I get it. By graphic programmer I mean people interacting at low-level between the machine and it's gpu. These people would not use Unity because their job is to build game engines itself
 Westicles: you want to talk to madknight.  he's always talking about shaders and whatnot
 AntiSquid: you want to build your own engine and want some advice on it&#160;?
 Filippo-Fracascia: Thank you Westicles&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: there's some fun videos out there, including some built to display as ASCII for command line or notepad 
 Filippo-Fracascia: No, my goal is to learn vulkan and openGL and I just wanted to find someone more experienced than me who could tell me a things or two. Never in my life I'd be able to build such a complex engine like unity, or unreal. The thing is, almost every game company uses it's own game engine, and graphic programmers are those who build these engines.(hence why I said specific job, even 'tho it's not well defined). Sorry if I sounded rude about that
 AntiSquid: no, we're good, i was confused about what you want and i would simply search for a tutorial on what you want, plenty out there
 Filippo-Fracascia: i understand, thanks
 Wontonimo: Filippo-Fracascia , have you used <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">https://www.shadertoy.com/</a>&#160;?
 Wontonimo: there are a lot of examples there with full code available
 Filippo-Fracascia: awesome man, thank you!
 NotANick: hmm your c++ compiler cant write your input
 NotANick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ascii-art">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ascii-art</a>
 NotANick: test 5
 NotANick: write row
 NotANick: because i passed all other tests except this
 IamTheSmix: Hello Again
 IamTheSmix: what about some games to implemente DRL&#160;?
 Wontonimo: DRL?
 IamTheSmix: Deep Reinforcement Learning
 Wontonimo: use any game
 Wontonimo: but you'll have to simulate it locally
 IamTheSmix: ah okay
 Wontonimo: just a sec, i got a link for you
 IamTheSmix: simulating DRL is more complicated to implemente DRL :D
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 5DN1L: NotANick Not sure what your problem is? My C++ code is able to pass test case 5.
 Wontonimo: IamTheSmix this site is more about classic AI and optimization of limited resources.  DRL isn't that
 IamTheSmix: I have Open IA gym that offer some enviromnent, but I felt having no fun, I need to competewith ppl :D
 NotANick: ok i found my problem but i still cant write your rows tho
 Wontonimo: some people have made NN bots for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe , Oware Abapa, Spring Challenge 2021.  All those have been crushed recently by NNs.  Check them out
 Wontonimo: oh, and the top bots in Mad Pod Racing is NN
 Wontonimo: try to get to num 1 on any of those using DRL.  If you do then you can be pretty sure you've mastered DRL
 Wontonimo: (and optimization)
 struct: so many NNs nowadays
 struct: Most board games have NNs
 AntiSquid: IamTheSmix there are sites for that too
 rocio19: hellooo
 Wontonimo: Automaton2000 how do we say hello to noobs&#160;?
 Automaton2000: so where do you get an idea of what i am talking about the same amount
 Wontonimo: that's the least sense that bot has made all day
 Wontonimo: heyy rocio19 , this is an open chat.  talk about coding here
 Wontonimo: if you see text in red it is either because you r name was mentioned or because you are having a panic attack
 IamTheSmix: thanks for informations 
 IamTheSmix: I was looking forward to redo another code for TicTacToe
 IamTheSmix: I have done one i python 
 IamTheSmix: in*
 IamTheSmix: Python is not the best language for this kind of games
 Wontonimo: nope
 IamTheSmix: cuz it need 100ms response 
 IamTheSmix: so I will try C++
 Wontonimo: how many simulations per frame were you able to achieve using python?
 IamTheSmix: I was able to do 400 as big max 
 IamTheSmix: I knew after that N*1 was doing like 26000
 IamTheSmix: hahaha
 Wontonimo: honestly, i'm amazed you got to gold with python.  That frankly is incredible
 IamTheSmix: I used Montecarlo 
 Wontonimo: plain MC or MCTS&#160;?
 IamTheSmix: I will try it in c++ combined with alphe beta
 IamTheSmix: MCTS
 Wontonimo: cool.  combining with alphabeta is also called MCTS Solver 
 IamTheSmix: I though it was called hybrid 
 IamTheSmix: anyways...
 Wontonimo: to beat the gold boss you'll need about 20k simulations for MCTS without solver.  i don't know what you would need if you had solver .. i'm guessing 16k
 Wontonimo: perhaps as low as 12k
 IamTheSmix: do I need to do pre-calculaton&#160;? I saw in some forums that to get legendary you need to precalculate
 Wontonimo: no you dont for UTTT
 MyMonkey: Precalculate win/loss/draw on miniboards: a 512 array
 Wontonimo: serious optimization though.  Like, keep your Node class to less than 30bytes, reuse memory instead of using delete 
 Wontonimo: yes, I was thinking that too MyMonkey, but actually you can get to legend without doing that and instead using avx
 Wontonimo: so it isn't needed, but it's easier for sure
 Wontonimo: optimize the calculation of UCB, allocation of Nodes, memory usage, log calculations, and random number generation
 IamTheSmix: big optimization of code indeed
 IamTheSmix: use of binary representation of the board is primary
 GamingGnawer: is there a natural way to binary encode the board when each cell has 3 states?
 GamingGnawer: can I do better than 2 bits per cell? By being.. cleverer?
 Wontonimo: 3 boards , 1 for player 1, 1 for player 2, 1 for tied
 Wontonimo: for the miniboards, use 2, one for each player
 Wontonimo: unavailable = player_a | player_b
 GamingGnawer: That would use the same amount of memory as my idea of a -setbit and player-bit for each cell, but the look-up would be faster, since the bit-set is smaller... right? 
 pmor: you can use 2 boards for the macroboard.  test if both bits are set on the other two boards to determine a tie
 GamingGnawer: but is the test more expensive than the board?
 pmor: possibly.  For me an inplay board takes 3 bittests
 pmor: though now that I think about it, I could invert the tests I'm doing so that I can determine if the board is still in play with only 1 bit test
 Codyz: when should i use SHIELD in mad pod racing?
 GamingGnawer: when tackling or possibly to mitigate being tackled
 Thorcode: I duno
 ZXC01: hi
 Thorcode: How can I know my team id in botter of the galaxy
 Wontonimo: Codyz , you don't need shields until you are in gold
 Thorcode: yeah I told him that
 Wontonimo: did he listen?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: bc I help him fix the BOOST
 Wontonimo: not the boots&#160;?
 Thorcode: yep
 GamingGnawer: :joy:
 Wontonimo: ah, those tricky boots
 Thorcode: he probably did not know about vel
 Wontonimo: hey GamingGnawer , how goes?
 GamingGnawer: Is good
 GamingGnawer: reworking the UTTTT code with bitset
 Wontonimo: very nice
 GamingGnawer: also not entirely sure if red messages are whispers
 GamingGnawer: in which case others might be confused :P
 Wontonimo: they are not
 GamingGnawer: learned something today then ^^
 GamingGnawer: I did the certification for c++ earlier
 GamingGnawer: and now I'm concerned for the state of industry :P
 Wontonimo: i see you are &gt;99%  That's good
 Wontonimo: just like 50% of the people who take the test
 GamingGnawer: not for the world... XD
 GamingGnawer: so it compares not to people who test, but to all who interact with the puzzle?
 Thorcode: I'm just 10%
 struct: i think is just score based
 struct: i would ignore the&#160;%
 Wontonimo: here is an example of the kind of bitboarding I do&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a> it is an example of solving 3x3 TTT using MC (not MCTS) with bitboards
 Wontonimo: in 99ms it is able to preform 205,428 simulations
 GamingGnawer: I used bitset&lt;9&gt; for  my masks instead of uint16_t
 Wontonimo: yeah, that works
 GamingGnawer: does it actually save any memory?
 Wontonimo: does what save memory?
 GamingGnawer: using bitset&lt;9&gt; over unint16_t
 GamingGnawer: or does my 9 bits just have some spare room :P
 struct: it costs more memory actually
 struct: cerr &lt;&lt; sizeof(uint16_t) &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; sizeof(bitset&lt;9&gt;) &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: 2 8
 struct: at least on uttt
 GamingGnawer: wow 2 to 8 that's baaad
 Wontonimo: oh my!  i didn't know
 Wontonimo: for MCTS, instead of pointers to children and parents, I use uint16_t also.
 GamingGnawer: another question, which really puts the &gt;99% into perspective...I thought you could no initialize static class members in the class... But you do?
 struct: thats inside a function
 IamTheSmix: Hello again
 IamTheSmix: can we push another program with other language without taking out the previous one&#160;? 
 struct: in bot programming?
 GamingGnawer: hmm curiously bitset&lt;9&gt; requires static constexpr whereas unint_16 is happy with static const
 IamTheSmix: I have done one in UTTT with Python and I want to push another program with C++
 struct: you will replace your current bot
 struct: with the latest submit
 struct: no GamingGnawer
 struct: you can still initialize in a struct/class
 struct: if its a static constexpr
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dda447d8-289f-4058-a5ef-94e386f116c0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dda447d8-289f-4058-a5ef-94e386f116c0</a>
 Wontonimo: IamTheSmix your previous code is saved.  you can find it in the "History" button on the left
 GamingGnawer: yeah I missed making it constexpr and googled something bad to be convinvced I had to move initialization
 struct: sometimes the behavior might be different based on the c++ version
 Thorcode: hey what does mana do in botter
 struct: where?
 Thorcode: botter of the gala
 Wontonimo: special abilities
 Thorcode: and it is for bronze??
 Wontonimo: idr
 struct: i think so
 Thorcode: sad, I want to do it too
 struct: maybe you can check the cg youtube channel
 struct: There is a recap of the stream I think
 Thorcode: yes
 Thorcode: I mad it to wood 1
 struct: nice
 Thorcode: bronze now
 struct: o.o
 Thorcode: yes Finnaly I understand that bot
 Thorcode: seven(times(five())) = 35, could you guy help me rate a puzzle like this?
 Thorcode: if I can make one
 Thorcode: I have solution for it
 struct: would maybe be to easy for a puzzle
 struct: maybe a clash?
 Thorcode: nah Ithink I will make an easy puzzle
 struct: yeap is solvable in under 2 minutes
 Thorcode: realluy
 struct: yes
 UZUHAMA: Hello world

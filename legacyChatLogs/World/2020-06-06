 rmuskovets: hi
 rmuskovets: does anyone know how to get base location in platinum rift 2?
 eulerscheZahl: at the beginning of the game there's only 1 zone with you as a owner. same for the opponent base
 rmuskovets: thanks

 rmuskovets: eulerscheZahl what's that codingame pastebin thingy?
 eulerscheZahl: write more than 5 lines and it gets a pastebin
 rmuskovets: wow
 rmuskovets: i didn't know about it, thx
 Nerchio: imagine if you could hide clash of code invitations inside a pastebin
 rmuskovets: hmm...
 Astrobytes: Morning
 AggYz: morninh

 eulerscheZahl: 1. I should not win this game2. I should win it earlier
 Nerchio: 1. yes 2.yes
 Nerchio: but you going by my HQ was funny
 eulerscheZahl: i prioritize exploration
 Nerchio: commit depends a lot on if you get terrible imbalanced maps at the start 
 Nerchio: where you have guaranteed draws :p
 eulerscheZahl: we need leagues
 wlesavo: it would be nice to have legend open with re curse as a gold boss  :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: wlesavo, I see we disagree on the definition of 'nice' :D
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 Illedan: I like the idea
 struct: Wont it be too strong?
 struct: I never played pr2 so i have no idea
 eulerscheZahl: he's first for a reason
 jrke: which pathfinder can i use in PR2
 eulerscheZahl: a blue one
 Illedan: FloydWarshall
 eulerscheZahl: on that mapsize? you got to be kidding
 Illedan: Works&#160;:)
 Illedan: Uses at most 650 ms
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: ok, not what i expected :D
 eulerscheZahl: won't work with python

 Illedan: If I set platinum on a level too high, it goes into internal error
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: well done :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I can even give each player 999 units to start with
 Illedan: Makes me timeout&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: 218.413 ms on spiral, 304.433 ms on second. Not-very-well optimised BFS. Figured it'd be better than F-W
 eulerscheZahl: sure it is

 sayantan_2005516: i need help
 sayantan_2005516: anyone up?
 gmanohar21: i need friends
 sayantan_2005516: i am unable to understand problem statement
 sayantan_2005516: can anyone help me with any tutorial or links?
 Nerchio: im not sure if its fault that PR2 is an old game but java times out sometimes at the start of the match and it doesnt happen in IDE
 Alshock: sayantan_2005516we can't know what you don't understand from that statement, what are you trying to solve in the first place? What's confusing?
 sayantan_2005516: i am confused in the statements. in hackerrank , i am getting all the problem statemets..but in this site, i am confused
 sayantan_2005516: do you have any tutorial links?
 eulerscheZahl: on CodinGame you get a list of problems here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 AntiSquid: sayantan_2005516 which problem, what part of the statement is confusing, etc etc, can only reiterate same questions as before as you weren't clear where you are stuck

 eulerscheZahl: "not understandable"how did 160k users solve it then?
 wlesavo: one of my teachers used to say you dont have to understand the subject to be able to teach it
 Astrobytes: If he's used to hackerrank, unless it's an exceptionally dry problem statement with zero 'story' it might confuse him I guess
 VincentPinet: bad teacher no donuts

 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: i don't see how hackerrank was easier to understand Astrobytes&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: What I meant AntiSquid is he expects the problems in a particular format, most likely.Input, expected output, constraints. 
 Astrobytes: No 'fluff'. It confuses certain kinds of people 
 Xcalibre: hi AntiSquidwhat is the significance of the red dot in ur profile picture?
 AntiSquid: that's where the milky way is
 WINWINWIN: I dont see a red dot&#160;:/

 Astrobytes: What? Your improvements?
 wlesavo: or SR NN
 Illedan: I wish wlesavo&#160;:(
 Illedan: Will work on that later today
 Illedan: My rewrite into local structure instead of the hacky code I had in the IDE. Doing PR2
 Illedan: And I added some improvement
 Illedan: some tracking and better Linq
 Astrobytes: Nice. Jumped a few ranks I see
 Illedan: 15 until glory
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: (for me to be in range of dropping euler)
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Illedan: :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: Nice goal :P
 Illedan: Marchete was too far away
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: I would rather want to focus on my NN
 eulerscheZahl: uncool
 inoryy: you're doing NN for PR2, Illedan?
 eulerscheZahl: for search race
 Illedan: ^
 Astrobytes: He's doing an EDA for PR2
 Illedan: eda?
 Astrobytes: Euler Dropping Algorithm
 Illedan: :P

 Astrobytes: You made a GDD
 eulerscheZahl: game dropping drop?

 dyc3: Hey fellas, could I get another set of eyes on this bug I'm having?
 Astrobytes: Just post your question and/or code, someone will help out if they can dyc3
 dyc3: Sometimes, my code doesn't read all the lines in code a-la mode. This is my code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/aragulohuj.sql">https://hastebin.com/aragulohuj.sql</a>
 Astrobytes: this might be another flush issue
 Astrobytes: Try adding flush=True to your print statements
 Astrobytes: (I didn't check your code but it's a common issue)
 Astrobytes: *properly
 eulerscheZahl: can phase be something else than 0 and 1?
 dyc3: but this happens when reading the input. When this bug occurs, it reads everything but the last line of input
 eulerscheZahl: flush the error stream
 eulerscheZahl: trust Astrobytes
 dyc3: ill try it
 eulerscheZahl: def log(x):
 dyc3: ...that fixed it
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 dyc3: thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 dyc3: thats so frustrating though, I spent a good 4-5 hours debugging this
 wlesavo: i wonder how many time was consumed by this flush issue across all the users
 Astrobytes: Don't be put off asking for help sooner, sensible questions get answered&#160;;)
 wlesavo: around 1-2 hours for me as well
 Astrobytes: CG were supposed to be doing something about the buffering/flushing no? 
 dyc3: I asked yesterday but nobody responded. It was kinda late tho
 Astrobytes: Yeah, best to pick a time when a lot of Europeans are on lol
 Astrobytes: Also, sometimes stuff just gets lost in chat
 wlesavo: are you on lol
 Astrobytes: I'm in standby mode, not on, not off :P
 wlesavo: i mean on lol sounds like on drugs
 Astrobytes: Ah, nah you'd say "on it"&#160;:)
 wlesavo: true
 wlesavo: so are you?
 Astrobytes: Only prescription ones :D
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure 'recreational' pharmaceuticals and coding go hand-in-hand lol
 eulerscheZahl: robo suggested to modify the python template or the way how python is executed. Thibaud added it to the bugtracker
 eulerscheZahl: that's the last thing I heard
 Astrobytes: Hm. Another "wait and see if it happens"
 eulerscheZahl: we have .net core with release mode now
 eulerscheZahl: didn't think it would happen, yet it's there
 Astrobytes: True.
 hem123: question i generally tend to use dataframes to store data retreived by for loops
 hem123: is there any other trick that might be far more efficient
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have no idea what that means
 MostComplicatedUsername: Actually, i probably do, I just don't know it by those words
 eulerscheZahl: same
 Astrobytes: google sez pandas
 MostComplicatedUsername: sez pandas?
 MostComplicatedUsername: hmmmm suspicious
 Astrobytes: (says)
 MostComplicatedUsername: I got something about a python library
 Astrobytes: I googled it. Google said pandas.
 MostComplicatedUsername: oh
 eulerscheZahl: i get a dance tshirt

 Astrobytes: well jrke, there's a jrke1 already from India
 jrke: thats not me
 jrke: i also saw him also messaged him but no reply
 Astrobytes: Well, it's technically not allowed, but a lot of people do have alts. Don't use them in competitions though.
 jrke: K
 eulerscheZahl: i deleted my alts
 Astrobytes: I've only got one, not used it for a while
 Astrobytes: Only used it for testing before switching algos on CSB and Oware
 eulerscheZahl: for me it was kutulu in the contest preparation
 eulerscheZahl: then csj joined the testing team, is reaction was something like "so many toads"
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: where is csj anyway, didn't see him around for a bit
 jrke: eulerscheZalh are you taking part in this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: not a contest
 jrke: oh yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and no
 jrke: K
 Astrobytes: I see how PR2 is an improvement on PR1, PR1 doesn't look particularly enjoyable.
 AntiSquid: wasn't csj streaming clash of code with viewers recently? think it was mention on discord Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: PR1 depends too much on the first turn
 eulerscheZahl: especially with more than 2 players it's a mess
 eulerscheZahl: and in fullscreen you don't even know which bot is which player
 eulerscheZahl: no names in the replay
 Astrobytes: Didn't notice AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: me neither, haven't saw him in a while
 Astrobytes: And yeah, even just a cursory look at the game made me a bit apprehensive about doing it
 eulerscheZahl: but i muted the streaming channel on discord
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sv1khk">https://prnt.sc/sv1khk</a>my filtering

 jrke: ya 
 jrke: bye astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl,  no memes eh
 AntiSquid: gn jrke
 eulerscheZahl: luckily that meme channel is persistent now. not this random friday anymore that i had to mute each week
 eulerscheZahl: and pings still work, even when the channel is muted
 AntiSquid: i didn't get the logic behind that, why delete it after friday ... 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that was pretty odd
 Astrobytes: Perhaps it was light relief for all those devs who push to procution on Fridays
 Astrobytes: *production even
 b0bR0zz: Hi
 AntiSquid: Non
 b0bR0zz: what a cool site
 b0bR0zz: love it
 AntiSquid: then welcome to CG, enjoy your stay and get an avatar! :D
 Astrobytes: Randomly talking French AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: i occasionally say no to new people saying hi
 AntiSquid: really old habbit
 AntiSquid: habit *
 Astrobytes: In a variety of languages or just French?
 Astrobytes: I might have said 'nee' in this case
 b0bR0zz: got an avatar
 AntiSquid: reminds me of rockymullet's avatar :p
 Astrobytes: Yeah his is a Bob Ross photoshop job lol
 MostComplicatedUsername: i give up
 MostComplicatedUsername: pr 2 is impossible
 Astrobytes: Why? What are you struggling with?
 MostComplicatedUsername: I know what I want to do in concept, but I have no idea how to actually create it
 Astrobytes: What concept do you want to implement?
 MostComplicatedUsername: First I want to store all the visible cells in a list
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then I find the ones with the most platinum
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then I check if there are pods adjacent, if not, then I move pods closer
 MostComplicatedUsername: And I do the same for the enemy base
 WINWINWIN: python is probably the best language to implement that for
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im using python
 WINWINWIN: sorted(zones, key = lambda x&#160;: x.platinum)
 Astrobytes: As long as your graph structure is OK none of that should be an issue
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: why u no like BR2k48&#160;:'(
 pb4: (only multi filtered in your screenshot :no_mouth:)
 Astrobytes: You can filter cells that are yours, then filter their neighbours by platinum or whatever. The visible cells are the cells surrounding a cell with a unit on, as well as that unit's cell @ MostComplicatedUsername
 Astrobytes: Shocking isn't it pb4&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ik that astro... I'm struggling with actually moving the units around
 MostComplicatedUsername: Not having coords is annoying
 Astrobytes: In what way? It's pretty straightforward no? Move x units from a to b
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yeah but I have to check if they're linked
 MostComplicatedUsername: Annoying
 Astrobytes: What are you using for your graph?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Graph? I'm just storing info in lists
 MostComplicatedUsername: Like, for the linked zones
 Astrobytes: "The game is played on a continent that is shaped using hexagonal zones. Links between zones are provided at the start of a game as a graph."
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yeah
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im just storing all the zone 1s in a list
 MostComplicatedUsername: And zone 2s in another
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then I use a loop to match them when I want to use it
 Astrobytes: Have you heard of an adjacency list?
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Right, you know how you store cell neighbours for each cell in a grid?
 MostComplicatedUsername: No
 MostComplicatedUsername: Probably
 Astrobytes: Wow, ok
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have to create a list for each cell?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then store cell ids of neighboring cells in it?
 eulerscheZahl: class Cell {
 eulerscheZahl: do you have something like that?
 Astrobytes: ^
 MostComplicatedUsername: no
 Astrobytes: Do it
 MostComplicatedUsername: I just look at the lists of linked zones to check if they're neighbors 
 Astrobytes: Then when you read the links in the first turn, cell[link1].neighbours.append(link2)cell[link2].neighbours.append(link1)
 Astrobytes: or whatever it is
 eulerscheZahl: so you have:class Link { Cell A, Cell B }List&lt;Link&gt; connetions;?
 MostComplicatedUsername: idk what that does
 MostComplicatedUsername: I just have 2 lists
 MostComplicatedUsername: 1 for cell #1
 MostComplicatedUsername: And another for cell #2
 WINWINWIN: a = {}
 eulerscheZahl: sounds slow
 MostComplicatedUsername: And I just match the indices
 MostComplicatedUsername: or indexes?
 MostComplicatedUsername: idk
 WINWINWIN: indices
 eulerscheZahl: there are 2 common ways: the list from above and the matrix
 WINWINWIN: use a dictionary, lot easier
 eulerscheZahl: boolean[][] connected
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yeah but I'm bad with dictionaries winwinwin
 MostComplicatedUsername: Like, I can't use them
 Astrobytes: I hardly every use a matrix for most things tbh, then again I don't do much CP
 eulerscheZahl: i usually go for the list as wel
 eulerscheZahl: l
 Astrobytes: MCU, all you need to do is have a Cell/Zone class, that has a list with the cells/zones directly adjacent to it
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have a solution, thanks astro
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 LunaticGamer: do cto of coding game usually visit people's linked profiles?
 AntiSquid: are you asking if you can get a job through CG&#160;?
 MostComplicatedUsername: There is a big yellow button labeled "JOBS"

 OpenAl: wood 1 Coders Strike Back, how do I use boost in python?
 Tiramon: same as in any other language OpenAlYou can use 1 acceleration boost in the race, you only need to replace the thrust value by the BOOST keyword.
 Tiramon: so instead of 
 Tiramon: 9885 3657 200
 Tiramon: you output 9885 3657 BOOST
 Uljahn: print(x_target, y_target, "BOOST")something like this i guess
 jimmyjansen93: Im not sure if it is different in python, but in JS it should be "BOOST"
 jimmyjansen93: Speaking of which, anyone got ideas for bumping implementation? I am not sure how I can use bumping to my advantage
 Uljahn: there are some links on the landing page of CSB
 jimmyjansen93: Ahh missed those, thanks
 Uljahn: magus's article could be useful when you're in gold/legend
 jimmyjansen93: I will be promoted to silver in couple minutes
 jimmyjansen93: but interesting reads anyway
 OpenAl: @Tiramon, how do I output BOOST only once in the loop and how do I choose an optimal time?
 jimmyjansen93: @openAI you can make a boolean outside of the loop and set it to true once you have boosted
 jimmyjansen93: And ya I know I am no Tiramon :D still useful info I would say :p
 OpenAl: thanks Jimmy!
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: thanks Jimmy!
 OpenAl: how do I implement said boolean?  I can't just say:if i_have_boosted:
 OpenAl: I know figuring it out is the whole game, but a man can only bash his head against a brick wall for so long!
 HansonSin: i just create a boolean variable before the while loop
 OpenAl: do I have to define "has_boosted" as a function  that can return true?  is that what you mean?
 HansonSin: i define a = True before while loop and in the while loop: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7be4e7c-68ec-404e-b4f0-012fb9b4a15b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7be4e7c-68ec-404e-b4f0-012fb9b4a15b</a>
 OpenAl: oooohhhhhhhh! thanks so much HansonSin!
 HansonSin: :smile::smile::smile:
 jimmyjansen93: @OpenAI indeed set the boolean outside of the loop.I did `let hasBoosted = false` all the way at the top and then checked `if (!hasBoosted &amp;&amp; &lt;condition to boost&gt;)`
 jimmyjansen93: keep in mind that I write JS and not python, but same principle applies
 jimmyjansen93: I think I should go sleep, this will otherwise consume my night... things get a lot more complex at silver &gt;_&lt;
 HansonSin:&#160;?
 OpenAl: lets goooooo!  Thanks Jimmy Jansen!  Your contributions to computer education will have massive impact!  
 HansonSin: isn't it morning right now?
 OpenAl: you are the man Jimmy!
 jimmyjansen93: its 1:11am here
 jimmyjansen93: and you are most welcome @OpenAI
 DragonJ: ugh I hit the boost case to much what should I do?
 OpenAl: 7:17 here in NYC, passionate protesters outside my window!
 jimmyjansen93: Use what I described above, a global variable that you check before executing the boost
 DragonJ: when thrust is 300 but you are out of boosts...
 HansonSin: 7:17am here in Malaysia, didnt sleep for the whole night:tired_face:
 OpenAl: Hanson!  You need sleep!  You don't want to be richest man in the graveyard!
 DragonJ: I need to print a thrust of "tableflip"
 HansonSin: i'll sleep after i've promote to sliver league
 DragonJ: or a I LOST SO FLIP THE TABLE button
 OpenAl: why do i get "at Answer.py. not in a function on line 23" 
 DragonJ: probably some commented code or () hidding in your code
 DragonJ: but also could be a scope issue
 HansonSin: Oh yeah im sliver league now:laughing:
 OpenAl: WOOOOO!!!!!!
 jimmyjansen93: ayy goodnight gents, will be back tomorrow to go for gold
 HansonSin: i finally can sleep nowww:sleepy:
 HansonSin: bye everyone
 OpenAl: wooo!  see you then Jimmy and Hanson!
 OpenAl: thanks for all the help!
 DemoNemo5: i dont get the prompt haha
 DragonJ: how can I get a thrust of greater than 100 when out of boosts?
 DragonJ: because my  code keeps running max speed and it isn't beating the boss who is going 97!
 DragonJ: 99&gt;97 right????
 Snef: path &gt; spd
 DragonJ: would shielding increase my speed or what can I do to boost with no boosts
 Snef: shield disable your thrust for 4 turn
 Snef: and you can only use your boost one time
 Snef: after that you have nothing left than just using your thrust
 Snef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/471424500">https://www.codingame.com/replay/471424500</a>
 Snef: look how you miss checkpoint at the end
 Snef: you should fix thoses things
 DragonJ: If I cant fix it with thrust how should I fix it
 Snef: you can fix it with thrust
 sidinfinity: what is X0, Y0
 Snef: you just didn't make it
 DragonJ: I have 4 factors that determine my thrust and the main problem is I cant thrust at what my code says to.
 DragonJ: 104,105,106 without using boost
 Snef: even with boost you can't thrust 104 405
 Snef: 104 / 105 etc
 Snef: it's not a problem
 Snef: it's the rules
 Snef: the problem in the replay i linked is that you miss checkpoint
 Snef: you won't fix that with more speed but with smarter thrust management
 DragonJ: so more angle control? I already have set that on full going any more would cause worse overshoting
 OpenAl: i beat the comupter but its not promoting me.  thoughts or ideas?
 Snef: it would do with angle control
 Snef: OpenAl you have to be ranked above the boss at the end of the submit
 Snef: DragonJ but a smart angle control, maybe not just if angle &lt; X
 OpenAl: okokok got it thx!
 DragonJ: Snef currently I have an equation I used to get into silver which I dont want to change much.
 Snef: DragonJ then stick to silver :D
 Snef: if you want to improve you have to consider updating what you've done and udnerstanding you haven't done it perfectly
 Snef: missing a checkpoint = you have things to fix
 DragonJ: would ignoring angle entirely possibly help with my thrust problem?
 Snef: you really are asking if ignoring data would improve&#160;????
 DragonJ: yes 
 Snef: how can ignoring things would make things better
 DragonJ: semi,ignoring
 OpenAl: only one way to find out!
 Snef: try outputing thrust = 100
 Snef: you will see it's shit
 Snef: the more you use data the more you can do advanced stuff
 DragonJ: currently I am using 3 distance equations and using them for thrust but angle is being overfocussed on
 Snef: i could sum it as&#160;:currently you are missing cp
 Snef: your code is likeif angle &gt; 90 thrust = 0else thrust between 85 and 100 depending on the angle and distance
 DragonJ: yes I am gonna try ignoring angle and see how it performs
 Snef: spoilet it'll be worse
 Snef: spoler*
 Snef: spoiler**
 Snef: just stop trying random things
 Snef: start thinking
 Snef: if angle is 45 and dist = 3000 and thrust would you output&#160;?
 Snef: -and +what
 DragonJ: currently I have dist=3000 dist=100 dist=1500 which should I use?
 DragonJ: or should I use all
 Snef: i asked you a question dont ask me back
 Snef: you have to understand why you should output thrust = 0 or 50 or 100 or whatever
 Snef: you can't just try random things and hope you do well
 Snef: i mean you can, but it wont' be great
 DragonJ: lol I fixed it now I beat the boss
 Snef: and you won't learn anything
 Snef: go submit then
 DragonJ: I wasnt factoring the velocity in well enough
 Snef: it seems you want answer to your problem but you don't want to learn why you are performing bad
 Snef: that's sad
 DragonJ: now my code is optimal but it I still need to handle those edge cases ugh
 Snef: you code isn't optimal
 Snef: you think it is
 Snef: but it isnt
 Snef: how old are you btw&#160;?
 DragonJ: 21 
 DragonJ: can you help me find those edge cases of my updated code
 Snef: i tried to help you understand why you had problems 
 Snef: like with the replay i sent and asking things but you didn't want to answer and listen to that
 Snef: i won't parse replay  and tell you all your mistakes
 Snef: there is limit to kindness
 DragonJ: ok leaving for now... than
 Sovereigner: lmao, snef seems like an ass
 scareware047: yoo
 LelouchVC2: 11 and a half
 Kadim: Why is there no paste item in the context menu? How can I add?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Sovergeigner he's not, he's just tired of helping

 print[Hello_World]: how to code
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+code">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+code</a>
 print[Hello_World]: I don't know where to start in this website
 5DN1L: Have you learned any programming languages before?
 print[Hello_World]: html css
 5DN1L: those aren't the "programming languages" offered here
 sdfk: java is fun
 print[Hello_World]: I did clash of code with ruby
 5DN1L: so you know ruby?
 print[Hello_World]: but dont have time to finish
 print[Hello_World]: not really I just choose it randomly I dont know which language start with
 5DN1L: in that case, you should decide on a language and learn it on other websites first, because there is no tutorial of the basics here
 5DN1L: after learning it, you can come back here to practise
 5DN1L: (well there are some tutorials here but not very organised)
 print[Hello_World]: I know some basics algorithmics like condition and loop
 print[Hello_World]: but want to learn with practice
 5DN1L: that's also fine, you can google/research along the way
 5DN1L: you can do the untimed puzzles
 5DN1L: clash of code is timed and hence not suitable for your current situation
 5DN1L: the untimed puzzles are here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 5DN1L: I would suggest several to you to do first, as they contain hints
 5DN1L: they can be found in the Easy section
 5DN1L: Onboarding
 5DN1L: The Descent
 5DN1L: Power of Thor Episode 1
 5DN1L: Mars Lander Episode 1
 5DN1L: ASCII Art
 5DN1L: Horse-racing Duals
 ToastyBreadsicle: chosing a language depends on what you want to do with your code. If you like web stuff, JavaScript is quite good, or if you have a concept of what "back end" development is, ruby might actually be a good choice. For video games, learning a "C" based language such as C++ or C# is generally helpful. Otherwise just to learn basics and have e some fun, I recommend Python
 print[Hello_World]: alright thanks I will try those
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Ayza: + python would be very good if you are into data science/machine learning
 AdeelGamez: hello
 LiSiMing: The C++ Introductory Exercise has any seniors told you.

 loog: how to win shortest mode with kotlin
 Astrobytes: *How to win a marathon by walking.
 loog: :cry:
 Astrobytes: I guess if you make a private clash where everyone uses kotlin you might have a chance
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Has someone some material/documents/link or tips for parsing a regex into subexpressions
 blasterpoard: Manchi_o6o7 you might find what you're looking for by googling "regex capturing groups"

 j4at: I was teaching my "frined" python. He has bachelor's in Computer Science and couldn't solve Kirk's quest, one of the easiest puzzles out there HOW DID HE EVEN GET A BACHELOR DEGREE??? I gave up after he couldn't indent correctly, whenever I asked him to fix his indentation he started removing/adding spaces/tab randomly. Although codingame's IDE has those lines to help you. I ended my relation with him&#160;:)
 j4at: As a Python use I can't be a friend with someone who can't Indent correctly
 j4at: "Kirk's quest" is The Descent
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl brutal.....! :grinning:

 ASM_MOV_INT: so the nintendo sponsored contest, has a c++ version of the code, and the line comment is "Magic Centaurion Operation" .... what does that mean?
 ASM_MOV_INT: just wondering if it's a clue...

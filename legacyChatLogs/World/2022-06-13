 AryanTripathi: how is wanna even a slang? it means want to, right?
 AryanTripathi: yep my name was MrBlueBird2 previously @Westicles
 AryanTripathi: and that's my nickname btw
 AryanTripathi: btw was Alex 1 banned or something?
 AryanTripathi: wdym by suggested solution?
 5DN1L: "wanna" is colloquial and it is better not to use it in a puzzle statement
 j4at: "a type of language consisting of words and phrases that are regarded as very informal, are more common in speech than writing, and are typically restricted to a particular context or group of people."
 YS_Yousef: XD
 GroutchKeu: o/
 wlesavo: hey euler, i saw you pinged me yeasterday :slight_smile:
 j4at: Does anyone have python NN compression/decompression code? 1/2 compression is enough.
 derjack: utf-16?
 derjack: have you tried <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/environment-preparation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/environment-preparation</a> and ENCODER16k
 j4at: yeah that's what im planning to do.
 j4at: I mean utf-16

 jacek: if you dont mind losing some precision
 j4at: Thank you &lt;3
 derjack: generally i have 1 weight 1 char
 derjack: is it for spider attack?
 j4at: no it's for search race
 j4at: I decided to start with something simpler
 derjack: oh. i have 2560 weights there, binary floats as hex so it still fits
 j4at: Nice. Well I'm pretty sleepy rn. I will just lower the size of my NN and submit now. And then compress my NN after I wake up.
 j4at: I kept it very simple. I had a lot of bugs :3 So I kept removing all features until it started actually training, So I will need to reimplement almost everything including the "GAN RL" idea I had.
 derjack: GAN RL? oO
 YS_Yousef: hi
 YS_Yousef: new players from last time i was here nice
 YS_Yousef: codingame is getting more popular
 derjack: and new contest this week
 struct: hi
 icenugget: hii, i just joined 
 icenugget: still trying to figure out how everything works
 derjack: any coding experience?
 PoulpyCorp: c# intellisense IS DAMN BROOOKEN 
 PoulpyCorp:&#160;:'(
 derjack: oO
 struct: oh no, IE is gone
 derjack: huh
 struct: From June 15th forward it cant be used

 BrunoFelthes: Green Circle will be a major event? Like the spring challenge?
 struct: BrunoFelthes it will be bot programming
 struct: its similar I think
 struct: but this time its a sponsored contest
 BrunoFelthes: but will it count to the rank?
 struct: yes
 BrunoFelthes: WoW
 struct: will you join?
 derjack: it will count as contest
 BrunoFelthes: i will try... last time my wife didnt like very much my absence
 BrunoFelthes: june 16 is vacation, so, I will try
 BrunoFelthes: *holliday
 struct: jacek will win this contest. It will be a contest for NNs
 derjack: xors contest?
 BrunoFelthes: how do you know struct?
 BrunoFelthes: or, maybe another contest for reCurse
 struct: Just a feeling
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUuyE1GkhOo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUuyE1GkhOo</a>
 struct: There is this video, you can enable translation
 struct: anyways I have to go for now
 struct: cya later
 BrunoFelthes: based at this video, it will be a card game
 BrunoFelthes: like the spring 2021
 therealbeef: spring 2021 was more of a board game, no?
 derjack: eeyup
 derjack: maybe you mean locam
 kovi: locam is not green
 kovi: maybe playcard is not what we think it is
 therealbeef: i think they were dropping hints pretty obviously&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: huh, what did i miss?
 therealbeef: see youtube link struct posted
 eulerscheZahl: so i have to read subtitles?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i guessed spring 2021 btw."hex board, growing trees" was my prediction. i shared an md5 hash of this on discord prior to the contest
 therealbeef: what they're saying is uninteresting
 eulerscheZahl: certain pictures?
 therealbeef: code
 eulerscheZahl: i think i've seen the video before, didn't notice. let me rewatch
 eulerscheZahl: locam? hell no
 eulerscheZahl: if it's locam i'll rage-quit instantly
 eulerscheZahl: locam 2.0 with lines
 therealbeef: lines?

 eulerscheZahl: approved a month ago and only 8 players, not that popular
 eulerscheZahl: subtitles + translation to English works really well
 eulerscheZahl: and CG already has 3 million users now?
 Goran_Filipovic: im challenger in league of legends fellas
 eulerscheZahl: 5D alone banned at least 100k trolls here on chat, so the numbers might work out
 eulerscheZahl: and #de users fail to complete the simplest task&#160;:(
 Mortis_666:&#160;:(
 kovi: sprint challenge 21 is possible, they played it live on the video
 kovi: i mean photosynth
 eulerscheZahl: 3 days, then we will know
 eulerscheZahl: i also wonder if it will return as a multiplayer. any public statements about that?
 kovi: if not nn, is duct mcts is the way to go?
 kovi: hmm, 4 player would be a huge change

 KNTK: Did I understand correctly that you can copy answers for CoC?
 SandmanSW96: you can cut paste anything with text so yeah lol
 SandmanSW96: I considered keeping a default empty code in notepad to paste in
 SandmanSW96: but then I would have to manually enter all the input code every time out
 KNTK: Yeah my notepad++ has 5 tabs open for CoC only
 SandmanSW96: faster just to modify whatever 'mentally challenged' stuff they already put in
 SandmanSW96: lol I prefer just brute force with 60WPM
 SandmanSW96: hence my essay question answers
 KNTK: But there are cases where I find the whole solution, not just a single trick
 SandmanSW96: oh yeah some whole clashes are just repeats of others, unoriginal
 SandmanSW96: you could just paste an existing answer that would work on some others lol
 loganl723: .
 IDKPLAYS: ok
 jacek: whats wrong with c4
 DomiKo: hmmm?
 jacek: why so low
 DomiKo: just testing some early generations

 Westicles: anyone know if green circle will be playable after the event?
 Stromtropers: Just please don't banne me
 Scofio: :grimacing:
 Razovsky: Westicles nobody knows 
 VizGhar: was there any game not playable after event?
 Stromtropers: Hello
 Stromtropers: #clash
 Stromtropers: I am doing a clash
 struct: jacek you think thats the game?
 struct: From the ide pick I read I managed to read Cell
 struct: ide pic*
 jacek: they played it, could be red herring
 struct: I have no idea what game that can be
 struct: VizGhar crystal rush wasnt available for a while
 Westicles: the last contest is a good example
 Stromtropers: 5DN1L
 Stromtropers: Are you here
 jacek: last contest?
 Westicles: it was a special event then not released, at least for several years
 jacek: spider attack?
 struct: I think thats different
 struct: from what I understand it was a contest that companies could play during some time
 Westicles: this is also different... the first bot event
 struct: isnt this a normal bot programming contest?
 struct: Or is it different because its an "event"
 Westicles: let me ask on the discord mod channel
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Westicles: there are 2 puzzles with 2 approvals.  which will come first?

 jokoul: i solve temperatures puzzle with a rate of 90% but i have no idea about how to reach the last 10%
 jacek: what test cases
 jokoul: 03
 Sarstan: You might need to have a case for when there's no temp given.
 jokoul: 5526 alone
 jacek: what is your initial value
 jokoul: Sarstan thank you that's right, I forget to process the case of "only positive temp given"! 
 jokoul: I'm going to edit my code right now
 jacek: :tada:
 Sarstan: Awesome!
 jokoul: jacek thanl you for you support. 
 jokoul: *your support
 Darleanow: Hello guys
 Darleanow: need support on&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mime-type">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mime-type</a>
 Darleanow: they told me i have a problem with the upper lower in the validation 
 Darleanow: but in the test ones ive got no errors
 Westicles: we don't have access to the validators either
 LeVinekEz: C#&#160;?
 LeVinekEz: Darleanow
 Darleanow: okay better question&#160;;; (in python) How can i get the index of a dict, not using a key, but a valuy
 Darleanow: i made a list of lower values, to avoid upper lwoer problems
 Darleanow: and i get the index of the list, which is the index of the dict
 Darleanow: but it's a key search, not a index search for dict, how can i do that&#160;?
 j4at: d.key()[d.value().index(v)]
 j4at: d.keys()[d.values().index(v)]
 Darleanow: value = dct.keys()[dct.values().index(lst.index(fname2[-1])-1)]
 Darleanow: so i have basically this
 Darleanow: but methods arent correct
 j4at: huh&#160;? send code. I'm confused
 j4at: the code i sent you is to find a key in dict using the value
 j4at: dicts doesn't have indexes
 j4at: indices*
 Darleanow: even tho unordered
 Darleanow: i think like first is 0, second is 1 etc
 Darleanow: okay solved
 Darleanow: 1: a list of the ext (non modified)
 Darleanow: 2: a list of lower values
 Darleanow: then u get index of modified list, which gives u the index of the non modified list 
 Darleanow: and u print the value of the dct using tjhe key
 Darleanow: print(dct[lst2[lst.index(fname2[-1].lower())]])

 SandmanSW96: Any Unity folks in?
 SandmanSW96: lol nvm found it
 jacek: oO
 thethiny: after a clash gets 3/3 approved what happens
 struct: you can get it when you play clash of code
 Ayza: you get XP and published to coc
 thethiny: yeah my question was if it gets auto added or not, sorry for being unclear
 thethiny: thx
 struct: it does yes
 SandmanSW96: after a clash gets 3/3 approved, you and your 2 buddies can pat each other on the back while the rest of us curse the world on the crappy statement and test cases lmao
 thethiny: lmao
 Westicles: give the bad ones 1-star and they'll disappear
 Vicololo13: gm 
 struct: gm
 SandmanSW96: HAH
 SandmanSW96: 'give the bad ones 1 star and they'll disappear'  okay gimme a winning powerball and a large fries with that
 SandmanSW96: I gave up trying to rate any of them anymore
 Darleanow: AbrahamJLR&#160;?
 SandmanSW96: That sounds like "don't worry, all policemen are your friends and here to help"
 Westicles: if they are like puzzles, they get deleted at 20 ratings if average is less than... somewhere around 3-3.2, not sure where exactly
 AbrahamJLR: @Darleanow
 Darleanow: AH FINALLY
 Darleanow: what is *map used for 
 Darleanow:&#160;?
 AbrahamJLR: To unpack the map object and create one list with these items.
 Darleanow: its like a [i for i in x]&#160;?
 bobth: well yeah but you can only pass in a function for map
 bobth: otherwise you need to define a lambda 
 AbrahamJLR: Ye.  l=[*map(int,input().split())] is like l=[int(x) for i in input().split()]
 j4at: SandmanSW96 yeah we need quality clashes. Like mine
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/213999270d74e710935e05188c7bda64de831">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/213999270d74e710935e05188c7bda64de831</a>
 Ayza: mods gonna bully you
 Ayza: but WIP is the safe zone
 struct: solved in 2 chars
 bobth: Yo that's actually a top level CoC problem right there
 thethiny: any shorter python code for this 
 thethiny: print(<i>.join(x[-1]*int(x[:-1])for x in input().split()))</i>
 thethiny: I tied with someone else
 j4at: print(<i>.join(b*int(a)for *a,b in input().split()))</i>
 j4at: nvm it doesn't actually work :3
 thethiny: lol
 bobth: if you only have that one line you could use open(0) and unpack that
 thethiny: but I can't open stdin, right?
 thethiny: would be longer than my code
 AbrahamJLR: Maybe if you show an example input they can help you.
 bobth: probably
 j4at: F=<i>.join;print(F(c*int(F(n))for*n,c in input().split()))</i>
 j4at: it's the same length :3
 thethiny: the input is basically
 thethiny: 1# 13* and the output is
 thethiny: #*************
 AbrahamJLR: [print(end=x[-1]*int(x[:-1]))for x in input().split()]
 j4at: nice
 bobth: dang nice
 bobth: didn't consider using end=
 AbrahamJLR: exec(bytes('灛楲瑮攨摮砽ⵛ崱椪瑮砨㩛ㄭ⥝昩牯砠椠⁮湩異⡴⸩灳楬⡴崩','u16')[2:]) -2 chars
 bobth: ok what 
 j4at: utf-16 is lame
 j4at: only try hards uses that
 bobth: never seen that before ngl
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 bobth: ah
 bobth: feels like cheating lol
 j4at: I don't know why he used a list tho :3for x in input().split():print(end=x[-1]*int(x[:-1]))
 j4at: is 1 char shorter
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: don't paste clash code here
 bobth: they aren't
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: maybe
 bobth: He finished the round, then asked if there was a shorter solution
 Thorcode: he could ask in the clash room
 KAITOKID_1412: hello 
 AbrahamJLR: Hi. o/

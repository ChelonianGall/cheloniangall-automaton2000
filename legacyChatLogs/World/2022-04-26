 eulerscheZahl: i can't make a new shield before the old disappeared? sad
 aCat: no you cant
 eulerscheZahl: oh, there it is"SHIELD also protects entities from receiving a new SHIELD."
 dbdr: yeah, need to be vulnerable one turn :D
 aCat: bot its only one turn - even if he controls you
 eulerscheZahl: what bot?
 aCat: reapplied shield protects you
 aCat: *but
 aCat: damn how do i program if i miss the keys :P
 eulerscheZahl: fr chat is asking that for years :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh, blaster came out of the hide
 VaseSimion: Anyone knows when the gold league starts?
 jrke: ig today maybe not sure
 _NikJ: jesus, that elo gap on blaster is insane :D
 AshKetchum: i think it's 48 hours between each league opening
 VaseSimion: Thanks
 IvesL: how could we chat previous chat history?
 IvesL: check*
 eulerscheZahl: usually it's Monday, Wednesday, Fridaybut silver was already off from the schedule, so...

 eulerscheZahl: it says 5:29am but the server clock is off
 Fubuchi: judging from the top 1, early push is meta now?
 _NikJ: early push + stacking your wind, because obviously double wind - double the distance
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625119274">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625119274</a>does this bot try to protect both sides?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625119476">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625119476</a>
 eulerscheZahl: good morning PatrickMcGinnisII
 Fubuchi: this look easy to implement. Dunno what will happen when more people switch to this strategy. Too see who is faster? :grimacing:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: catuesday moanin
 CodeVixy: why does health, mana = input() and entity_count = input() work one after another if there is a line in between input for enemy health and mana..
 eulerscheZahl: because there is a loop around health+mana
 eulerscheZahl: and actually it does not work that way, as you overwrite these values in the loop
 eulerscheZahl: it's just a starter template, you still have to modify it (it's auto-generated)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u see this craziness?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625089071">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625089071</a>
 eulerscheZahl: MOB_SPAWN_RATE=0
 eulerscheZahl: funny
 CodeVixy: thank you, im struggling with the 'for i in range' bits and not having named objects. 
 eulerscheZahl: i think nerchio could handle it better
 eulerscheZahl: check this out CodeVixy<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/tree/main/starterAIs">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/tree/main/starterAIs</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php tarter, well there' a irs for everything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er starter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: first
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to pay taxes for the tarter?
 jrke: i have my 10th grade final paper starting from tommorow but i a coding
 jrke: :grinning:
 _NikJ: I honestly saw IRS as well and was like tf
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i had to pay $5288 in taxes yesterday...&#160;:(
 SashaNukem: damn
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure mine are higher
 eulerscheZahl: but we have public health insurance
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that was for just propery, IRS was last week
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crooks
 eulerscheZahl: everyone just wants your money
 eulerscheZahl: not me, all i want is legend
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a water well pump, had it fixed yesterday too... they kept trying to lie to me to pad the bill.  crooks everywhere
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you will get legend
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm doing ok, but i bet it will be hard to get out of gold
 PatrickMcGinnisII: waiting to resub ide code if I don't make it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 jamil321: Is there any way I can go back to a previous codebase?
 jamil321: I thoroughly messed up my code&#160;:(
 ceggart: History, you will se your submitted code of the arena
 Quidome: Always use git and commit often
 Quidome: but yes history in codingames can help out
 eulerscheZahl: SpringChallenge2022 git:(master) ✗ git log --oneline | wc -l4
 eulerscheZahl: i have 4 commits, not that much
 Quidome: 4 is far better then zero
 Quidome: :punch:
 eulerscheZahl: and the branch is master, not mainmy political correctness can be improved
 _NikJ: oh how dare you use master instead of main, you're so InSeNsITiVe
 Quidome: I think master is the current default isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: my git version should be recent and it's a fresh repo
 eulerscheZahl: i want a BOMB spell in the game, too many spiders at once
 _NikJ: that would actually be fun
 _NikJ: cost like 200 mana
 _NikJ: and a lifepoint :D
 dbdr: or chain reactions
 _NikJ: or if you hit an enemy with 3 winds, it goes 3 times as far
 _NikJ: oh wait, that exists :d
 eulerscheZahl: about 5 years ago at Russian AI Cup there was a too dominant strategy evolving around placing all units next to each other. organizers responded by adding an atomic bomb right before the end of beta testing
 karliso: ironic
 dbf: and it was easier to heal units after the bomb if you put them together, as earlier&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and then they sent you a tshirt with an explosion that looked like a hamburger
 dbf: and hoodie!
 eulerscheZahl: not for me, i opted for rage-quit early
 dbf: ah, sad. there were interesting strategies with simulation and potential fields
 dbf: eulerscheZahl looks like you submitted this morning, are submits fast now?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbf: thanks, will try a couple of minor fixes, hope gold will be open today
 jrke: what can be the expected cut off for gold?
 jrke: 600-700?
 eulerscheZahl: honestly: really hard to tell
 eulerscheZahl: silver opening may have been a boss that existed before the CG contest, as this was an internal hackathon first
 jrke: :neutral_face:
 eulerscheZahl: if so, maybe it's the same for the next boss. i remember an internal contest where we were allowed to participate. all league up to gold existed before contest start already
 eulerscheZahl: the fact that a league opened on sunday supports my hypothesis. usually they open leagues on workdays
 jrke: so if bosses are fixed so does that means gold boss is already there?
 eulerscheZahl: gold boss probably not. but silver boss might be determined already. i don't have any insider info
 dbdr: scripted boss opening? that's brave
 jrke: ah oki, thnx
 eulerscheZahl: have you seen the league opening? they resubmitted all 2000 silver players at once
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: they haven't done that in ages, always just moved the bots while keeping the scores
 jrke: maybe because they decreased total no. of battles in bronze league
 eulerscheZahl: they did? it's always less for bronze
 Illedan: They did
 eulerscheZahl: missed that. did they say so here on chat?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: It was 90 and suddenly it was 45
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/I899hjpnLeNv">https://prnt.sc/I899hjpnLeNv</a>
 jrke: maybe during this time ^
 dbf: yes, after the game stuck on second day
 eulerscheZahl: i know. gets slow again now
 dbf: yes&#160;:(
 dbf: just after my submit :joy:
 dbf: and only 202 are computing - not too much
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/j8Kofi.jpg">https://snipboard.io/j8Kofi.jpg</a>
 dbdr: ah, it's _NikJ
 eulerscheZahl: that was a decent game with balanced spells
 MindController: Guys, if I control an monster
 eulerscheZahl: just not open source
 MindController: Does his V.x and V.y changes in input?
 eulerscheZahl: no, it's a bug
 eulerscheZahl: CG agrees that it's a bug but hasn't decided if they want to fix it
 _NikJ: what's that dbdr? Work proxy is blocking access, can't see it&#160;:
 eulerscheZahl: FLIPENDO
 MindController: Man, its already second bug with the input
 dbdr: you printin Flippendo _NikJ
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/70">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/70</a>so yes, that’s a bug in the input&#160;: vx and vy should be updated too. We’ll see if we fix it tomorrow or decide to let it as it is.
 _NikJ: ah yes, back from Fanstastic bits contest :D
 eulerscheZahl: what's the other input bug?
 MindController: Sometimes monsters with threat_for being 1 or 2 just walks out of the map
 _NikJ: I print HP spells on all of them, Protego, Imperio, Flipendo
 eulerscheZahl: oh, funny
 MindController: When the end point is very close the 5000 mark
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even notice. i initially ignored the flags and computed on my own
 eulerscheZahl: but the CONTROL input bug made it impossible
 MindController: Sometimes threat_for gets confused
 eulerscheZahl: we can neither trust the v to compute on our own nor the threat flag, great
 _NikJ: is there anything we can trust except that the whole thing is broken af? :D
 MindController: But how do i compute v from enemy control spells then?
 eulerscheZahl: you can trust me when i say i won't pursue after i reach legend
 eulerscheZahl: you don't, that's the problem
 dbdr: I just assumed opponent control was intentionally hidden
 dbdr: curious if they will change it
 _NikJ: I won't even bother with legend tbh, I've lost 500 ranks by going from 3 def to 2 def 1 atk mode
 _NikJ: I suck at defending with 2, obviously
 dbdr: try 2 attackers&#160;;)
 jrke: :grinning:
 _NikJ: and stack the winds? :D
 blasterpoard: it's a bait, don't
 _NikJ: rather not
 _NikJ: "it's a bait, don't" said blaster, while being ahead of everyone by 7 elo 
 aangairbender: btw will the bug about mob speed after control be fixed?
 aangairbender: just had a match with blasterpoard and lived 211 tickes. kinda achievement
 eulerscheZahl: aangairbender read my last messages
 dinggg: Anyone know how many people join Gold straight away? Or is it based on the bot's grading/scroring?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/70">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/70</a>so yes, that’s a bug in the input&#160;: vx and vy should be updated too. We’ll see if we fix it tomorrow or decide to let it as it is.
 eulerscheZahl: usually it's about 20-30% of silver to gold. but that's speculation, a lot of things are different this contest
 dinggg: Okay, thanks.
 aangairbender: thanks eulerscheZahl
 _NikJ: Internal error. An error report has been sent to the CodinGame team.
 _NikJ: say what
 eulerscheZahl: what did you do to trigger it?
 _NikJ: clicked replayed in same conditions lol
 msumera: and do you know how many will go to legend? not sure if my 22th place bot is safe or i need to work on it a bit more&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: msumera its'  not safe, it will 
 blasterpoard: go to rank 100+ before legend
 aCat: gold confirmed today?
 msumera: and how many bots are usually in legend?
 dbdr: around 20 when it opens
 _NikJ: never stop improving it, there are people who are hiding their bots
 mokinau: hi how much do you get paid bros
 mokinau: :money_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: last time legend was much bigger than 20
 Illedan: Nothing is confirmed here. You have to guess it based on the direction of the starts at any given time.
 mokinau: get sum bitches fr
 eulerscheZahl: mods here?
 eulerscheZahl: right, we have dbdr
 mokinau: mOdS heRe? :nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: grow up
 eulerscheZahl: or i'll tell RamDeath
 Ramdeath: yea?
 eulerscheZahl: your student?
 Ramdeath: sec checking
 JozefPro: svx bicai
 Ramdeath: its Konstanta students
 Ramdeath: LSMU gymnasium
 JozefPro: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: oh, konstanta is another teacher?
 Ramdeath: yeap
 Ramdeath: sec i call him
 eulerscheZahl: nah, don't bother
 _NikJ: extra tough exams for this one
 cegprakash: I just found someone who has very high win rate against blasterpoard 
 cegprakash: but he's not in top 100
 cegprakash: and it's not me
 cegprakash:&#160;;)
 aangairbender: replay?
 cegprakash: secret
 cegprakash: or blaster will counter that counter
 cegprakash: I need to implement it first
 cegprakash: :P
 blasterpoard: yes, I definitely don't know about my bugs
 cegprakash: it's kinda obv how to defend from blasterpoard tho
 _NikJ: but you can't really know that you're playing against him, can you?
 cegprakash: that's right _NikJ that's why he's not in top 100
 dbdr: detect the behaviour, not the player
 _NikJ: behaviour being losing a point within he first 10 turns? :d
 cegprakash: blasterpoard: hint for u are stopping being aggressive if someone survives after 100 turns
 cegprakash: may be coz of less mana
 blasterpoard: cegprakash please, realize that I wrote that bot, I saw hundreds of its games and stop thinking you know something about it that I don't
 samon27: Hi, does anybody noticed this thing: I'd like to set up a debug massage under each hero (Append text after any command and that text will appear above your hero), but how should I append a text? just cout &lt;&lt; CommandStr &lt;&lt; debugMsgStr &lt;&lt; endl; doest not work
 samon27: omg really, thx!
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Ramdeath: mob takes damage before he moved  or after?
 eulerscheZahl: before
 eulerscheZahl: so you have a final chance to kill the mob
 Ramdeath: so hero do full move, hit mobs around 800 distance and then mobs move, right?
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 Ramdeath: tnx
 dbdr: before
 eulerscheZahl: chat scroll?
 dbdr: yep :D
 Rhadamanthus: lol that moment when I send what I think a better script but it does worse :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: might be randomness in submits
 DanTheMan832: can you recover previous code?
 ItsNotABug: yes
 DanTheMan832: how?
 eulerscheZahl: left side =&gt; history
 Rhadamanthus: Yeah I'm committing all versions in git. It's still at 14% or so, maybe it will get better
 IvesL: only for previous submission
 Rhadamanthus: Oh!
 DanTheMan832: ty
 Rhadamanthus: Thanks!
 TheDiscoCarnivore_7d72: what's up!!!
 TheDiscoCarnivore_7d72: y batman task really is hard?
 cegprakash: how do I find if a enemy hero is casting control this turn or casted control in the last turn
 ItsNotABug: You wouldn't know this turns actions until they're cast
 Fox787: Some people run a sim on the enemy for a small time and then run their own turns. could use that to predict the enemy is going to spell control,  but otherwise no way to know until it's active
 Pentracchiano: How do you run a simulation without knowing the enemy's strategy?
 Fox787: you run your sim, as the enemy, in the enemies position for a small time, then assume that the best action, is what they'll do against you
 Pentracchiano: So you run the sim as the enemy assuming it would behave like you do and then pick the best action you would do in their situation?
 Pentracchiano: (thanks btw)
 Fox787: Yeah at least that was one of the leading strategies from previous contests
 GuillaumeDrillaud: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/2365406ff0f8526ee6a1908a0e819a6c3e25db9">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/2365406ff0f8526ee6a1908a0e819a6c3e25db9</a>

 elderlybeginner: When gold league opens?
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know
 _NikJ: I no longer care about it, my bot sucks, it can't reach gold
 cegprakash: oh come on _NikJ u are at 800 u can do it 
 cegprakash: and u are wrecking me even tho I'm top 100
 _NikJ: I went from 200th to 800th when I improved my bot :D
 _NikJ: so at this point, I don't even know where to go from here
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/625281632">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/625281632</a> 
 cegprakash: look at u u dominate me
 eulerscheZahl: "and [yo]u are wrecking me even tho[ugh] I'm top 100"the whole game is a rock paper scissors festival
 Uljahn: Thibaud said on discord the gold opening is 4 hours and a half from now
 eulerscheZahl: ah, gold still on friday or also a day earlier then?
 eulerscheZahl: legend*
 Uljahn: dunno, most likely a day earlier
 cegprakash: the whole game is a rock paper scissors festival - except that we have tables, chairs, ladders, rocket launchers, butterflies and so and so
 _NikJ: cegprakash eh, looks cool at times, but it fails often
 eulerscheZahl: i hope so, that would result in a weaker boss
 cegprakash: _NikJ fix one game at a time
 eulerscheZahl: weak is good when you don't want to play
 _NikJ: when is this replay from? cegprakash I believe I've ruined the bot quite a lot since then :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's your arena version
 eulerscheZahl: you see that from the rank in the star. doesn't show for older versions
 cegprakash: just now _NikJ
 raxkin: I have a question. If i do a WIND spell, it will move 2200 only or will move 2200 + the 400 unit that the monster will normally move(if the push was in the same direction)?
 _NikJ: cegprakash it's weird that I kept pulling you out of base, I thought I put cooldowns on spells
 _NikJ: Anyone else using cooldowns on spells?
 Dapps: Do you mean so you don't keep spamming the same spell?
 cegprakash: _NikJ if it works it's a feature
 _NikJ: yes
 Dapps: I don't.. i usually end up in wind battles over a single spider lol
 ZndrBrok: o/ humans
 ZndrBrok: and not humans :P
 Pentracchiano: @raxkin the wind spell prevents the monster's move in the same round
 Pentracchiano: you can find it in the action order rules for a turn
 Pentracchiano: rule 7
 Pentracchiano: Are submission times still quite long? It discourages me a lot from playing&#160;:/
 Dapps: How long is long.. mine were taking 2-3 hours yesterday evening
 Pentracchiano: you're asking the right questions
 Pentracchiano: i'll just revert to how long are submissions now in silver?
 Jerrasterix: just now submitted will let you know when done :wink:
 Jerrasterix: long time no see automaton200
 Jerrasterix: long time no see automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if mob is used instead of monster, you safe 50% of chars per use
 Jerrasterix: aren't both mob and monsters the same Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: does anyone know the best way to learn a new language
 Thyl: gg jrke&#160;!
 cegprakash: the game sometimes is asymmetrical
 dbdr: in corner cases cegprakash?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/625324245">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/625324245</a>
 cegprakash: same code no random
 cegprakash: turn 189
 _NikJ: I've noticed that too
 dbdr: assuming your code is symmetrical&#160;;)
 dbdr: but I think it's true because of off by one differences
 _NikJ: I thought maybe my positions were not "symmetrical" when playing both sides

 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: The Gold league opens today at 3 pm UTC. The Legend league will open on Thursday at the same time.
 Thorcode: kinda fast
 Illedan: Isnt Legend on friday?
 Illedan: Is the wind outside the map by blaster fixed?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625356180">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625356180</a>Frame 109 to 113 Blue hero right side
 eulerscheZahl: check your emails Illedan, it says Thursday
 dbf: I hope that CG team still has access to website - they send an email instead of specifying date at the top of the page as usual&#160;:)
 Illedan: Huh?
 Illedan: Oh
 Illedan: Legend
 Bezbiletnik: How to exit from insert mode(vim) here? Because escape does not work
 eulerscheZahl: settings on the left, set to normal mode
 dbf: reset button is a nice control for vim
 eulerscheZahl: or re-install your browser to undo any settings you've made by accident
 eulerscheZahl: "I hope that CG team still has access to website"nice trolling
 Bezbiletnik: Hah, okay thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and not even a holiday in France. no idea why not friday but i'm happy with it
 dbdr: can quit earlier?&#160;;)
 dbf: :joy:
 dbf: also if legend starts earlier and they cut the same number of people it means that bot is easier
 dbf: boss is easier
 eulerscheZahl: exactly, the rage quit is near
 eulerscheZahl: and my submit is top20 somehow
 eulerscheZahl: don't ask me how, it's garbage
 dbdr: or they troll boss = #1
 struct: Illedan I dont think you will see any fixes
 eulerscheZahl: no, that would scare the newbies
 Illedan: What about that replay then?
 eulerscheZahl: last time the gold boss was around rank 50
 dbdr: the new meta
 eulerscheZahl: even the discussion about meta...you don't have that during simulation heavy contests
 eulerscheZahl: at least not to that extent
 Illedan: Then we talk about sims
 Illedan: :P
 struct: Where should the spider be pushed too?
 eulerscheZahl: the firepit
 Illedan: Depends on your location struct
 struct: if you aimed with your hero x it would go down
 struct: But this seems weird that it doesnt move at all
 SashaNukem: can I use multiple file in this?
 eulerscheZahl: only with some offline setup to bundle them
 dbf: eulerscheZahl "don't ask me how, it's garbage" - still no sim? :flushed:
 Thorcode: this puzzle is hard to control the knight around but the killing and using spell is easy
 eulerscheZahl: i have a sim but it's disabled
 eulerscheZahl: hero, not knight&#160;;)
 Thorcode: it just a knight with spell 
 eulerscheZahl: it has a pony tail, maybe it's a queen
 Thorcode: ah yeah
 Kellthazar: Well pointed, euler, :D
 burnpanck: we don't want to judge the gender people identify with just from their appearance, do we? :wink:
 Thorcode: knight could be a women
 Kellthazar: Brienne of Tarth
 Spressed: is the ASCII art challenge easy?
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, not even sim for mana?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that. yes
 eulerscheZahl: and spots where the bug will be in the next turns to properly intercept the path
 eulerscheZahl: and picking a spot to slap multiple spiders at once
 Illedan: I need that intercept thing too :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: spider slapping, that sounds weird
 Illedan: I'm not judging
 WannaBeHum1n: how does monsters heath scale
 WannaBeHum1n: is it always 12 to 15 to 17 to 22 ,
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it starts with 10
 SlurpasGasskagg: Regarding "health and mana", do you always get your health+mana first and second is the opponent or is it always upleft first and then downright player?
 eulerscheZahl: you, then opponent
 SlurpasGasskagg: thx sir!&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: "First 2 lines: two integers baseHealth and mana for the remaining health and mana for both players. Your data is always given first."
 Tuo: Formula spider maxHp = 10 + turn // 10 works pretty well
 SlurpasGasskagg: @eulerscheZahl u know blindness always starts with the eyes :P
 ThomasNicoullaud: eulerscheZahl road to top 1 without submit
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i get that sentence. you mean i get pushed up by other submitters?
 eulerscheZahl: rock paper scissors is strong in this game
 ThomasNicoullaud: I mean the last time I looked the leaderboard you were +50 :D
 eulerscheZahl: i submitted in the meantime
 eulerscheZahl: was 16th during the submit temporarily
 struct: are you enjoying the game more euler?
 MACKEYTH: blasterpoard's success drove me to switch to a double wind bot.
 eulerscheZahl: i still passionately hate it
 MACKEYTH: Doing so-so so far. Not as good as my single attacker bot. yet.
 wlesavo: MACKEYTH that was his plan all along
 struct: has any bug been fixed yet?
 eulerscheZahl: but legend is near, which gives me the strength to keep going
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, let me check the inputs again
 eulerscheZahl: i coded around the v bug
 eulerscheZahl: still wrong
 struct: thanks
 struct: I just canceled everything I had for the next days, time to aim for legend
 TobiasA: I can't wait for the next contest
 eulerscheZahl: more escapes?
 TobiasA: this one is irritating
 TobiasA: no bot programming
 struct: Im also not a fan of it
 struct: But I havent really tried it yet
 struct: I'm sure there are people that enjoy it
 TobiasA: yea I can hear their evil laughter from here
 aCat: struct sim or heur&#160;;-)?
 struct: I'm not a fan of heur
 aCat: I just can't focus to write eval and search, adding more heuristics is too easy
 struct: I'll try sim
 struct: But maybe a mix of both
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 aCat: yeah probably mix will be
 wlesavo: just add more heuristics into your eval  :slight_smile:
 struct: wlesavo the problem is that my evals usually are
 struct: hasPlayerWon(id);
 struct:&#160;:)
 wlesavo: that is one of the best heuristic there is
 struct: Yeah, i just cant use it on turn 1
 DaNinja: sim to turn 220
 Dapps: That's what I use first turn for
 eulerscheZahl: clever
 andyyyyy: I literally don't know what I'm doing
 dbf: I added a lot of heuristics to fix particular game issues and got ~-200 in total rank
 dbf: probably they made something else worse&#160;:(
 andyyyyy: you guys are too smart for me

 _NikJ: It's been asked at least 93483 times so far, but I still don't know: If a target's shieldlife is = 1, can you cast shield so it starts from the next, or does it have to be vulnerable for 1 turn?
 SadKris: Can 3 people do better than me in Clash of Code? I'm currently rank 1334
 BJD: you can't, it will be vulnerable
 andyyyyy: Is it true you guys have PhDs in mathematics and computer science?
 Hamp: who has the best "turtle" bot? (Just going for wild mana and defending)
 cegprakash: false. I don't know how to generate a 30 degree vector andyyyyy
 _NikJ: Nerchio or something I believe, Hamp
 ScifiSpirit: I'm afraid i just saw the kind of bot behavior that makes me think that defensive strategy is unviable against aggressive opponent. Or at least not sure how to counter it.
 ScifiSpirit: I'm fairly sure that the aggressive strategy is prevalent in higher leagues.
 _NikJ: I don't think many people know how to counter those super aggressive people, as we can see by blaster's bot shredding through silver
 Madara-Uchiha: phew
 Madara-Uchiha: the chat isn't dead for new account now
 Hamp: Defensive strategy can definitely be countered, I was just curious since I seem to lose to them most of the time
 Hamp: and so far I have lost every fight vs nerchio even though I'm rank 18 and he is 400ish
 _NikJ: weird, he was like top 10 last night
 _NikJ: or perhaps I'm mistaken
 Aya_Noaman: is there any way i can hide even the sidebar of this chat because it's a bit distracting every time an icon moves
 _NikJ: by using an external editor :D
 Hamp: Oh, he just submitted it seems, nevermind
 fsoares-: @Aya_Noaman Arrow button in the bottom left
 _NikJ: I'm sure you can remove the whole thing through inspect element though
 ScifiSpirit: Just like how it is in Mad Pod Racing, nothing but colliding bots there. I guess that's where they got the idea for the name.
 fsoares-: I don't have that high of reading comprehension
 Dapps: Been trying to counter blaster bot for last hour.. nothing. Not smart enough to beat it.
 dbdr: tfw your first match is against blaster :D
 Clagus: does shield block from wind?
 ahorling: yes
 Thorcode: i think no
 Alurian: yes
 Alurian: why wouldnt it
 Clagus: so if I have shield, wind will not move me?
 BJD: yes
 ahorling: correct
 Clagus: thx! crazy!
 Thorcode: that's good
 Thorcode: thanks for the infor 
 Alurian: half an hour!! 
 Abdi-29: i can't advance in silver:sob:
 Thorcode: me too xd
 Alurian: i'm hanging around 500 atm. but i'm confident the next upload will bring me lower 
 Kellthazar: wild mana farm seems be very effective
 ahorling: able to beat the AI pretty consistantly
 Alurian: jup
 ahorling: its the other players that mess me up now lmao
 Alurian: 70% or more of the winds are through wild mana for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Have mercy on me...I shield, enemy controls same mob simultaneous,  result is a mob that can't be spelled going the wrong way....like wtf
 therealbeef: i don't think that is correct. do you have a replay?
 Tuo: what happens if you give spell coordinates outside of the map?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625486132">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625486132</a> frame 173
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shileld on mob 115, control on 115
 jrke: damn what i did gold in 5 mins and i made submit lol
 WolfDarrigan: That seems to be what is intended.
 therealbeef: ah ok, i thought you we're talking about a bug&#160;;-) yeah that move sucks
 dbf: ok, where is The Boss?
 Alurian: it wil come in a min
 Nerchio: perfect time for submit
 Alurian: how many will be in gold?
 MeWhenI: 2
 DaNinja: tree fiddy
 blasterpoard: 450-ish, give or take a hundred
 Alurian: damn
 jrke: i will go 600+ bet
 Alurian: then im barely in or out
 msumera: 1000
 Alurian: boss here
 Waffle3z: o boy
 Nerchio: 457
 Nerchio: boss place
 msumera: yay, i'm in gold
 kreska: me too with my lousy bot:D
 Waffle3z: hopefully fewer than 2000 being promoted today
 VizGhar: 450? too much
 MeWhenI: 2000 would be like the whole silver league
 msumera: 80 promoted for now
 _NikJ: oh look, ANOTHER samsung sds :D
 Alurian: i beat boss
 Nerchio: boss feels weak
 jrke: ah man again recomputation in gold
 DomiKo: can we guess how it is?
 DomiKo: who*
 msumera: boss writes hero ids on each move, it would be possible to guess that
 Jerrasterix: wait but why is blaster not in gold yet&#160;??
 msumera: it takes time to process all bots
 Jerrasterix: ahahah....
 Jerrasterix: I am sus of this samsung SDS _NikJ :thinking:
 Murat_Eroglu: ah crap, here we go again
 Fubuchi: easy win silver bot. Time to rest for a day and change to an aggressive bot. My current attack strategy is is too weak
 cegprakash: lets have 10 seconds silence in the chat to pray for the servers which is gonna burn for the next few hours.
 dbf: yep, recalc - no submits in several hours
 conejoAndy:  
 Whiskee: gold is much smaller than silver was, so maybe not as many hours
 cclaude42: Hey everyone! Quick question&#160;: what's the best way to know if new code does better without going through two hours of Submit&#160;?
 msumera: you can try to challenge some players in IDE
 IvesL: manually beat higher ranking palyers?
 msumera: or your own submitted bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: .5 below boss, fml
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er ,05
 DuckyLuckVN: Hello guys, I don't know why the error is always display&#160;:(Game Summary:Bad command
 cegprakash: cclaude42 play ur IDE code vs arena code 
 _NikJ: what rank is the bot
 Mortis_666: seeing myself at top 10 is very weird lol
 jrke: geez the servers are not gonna burn that much cause total no of battles are less
 cegprakash: Mort
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now above by .04
 cegprakash: Mortis_666 same here.. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: such suspense
 cegprakash: okay there comes the promotions
 Mortis_666: 😂
 dbf: looks like very few games in gold? I have 6 for now and I'm on 19%
 jrke: yeah
 dbf: or it is just for initial recalc?
 jrke: for now maybe
 aCat: that would be reasonable
 Dapps: rank jumping like crazy every few seconds
 aCat: surprisingly for cg oO
 Nerchio: i am stuck in silver on 18% submit
 cegprakash: my promotion is stopped till all the bots above me finishes computing?
 cclaude42: Thanks for the answers! How do I "manually" try against other players though&#160;? Do I need to run it locally with the referee code&#160;?
 SirLoxley: omg, such suspense, I am bouncing between just above the line and beneath
 cegprakash: cclaude42 below ur browser IDE u can choose the player cclaude42
 cegprakash: u can even try as 2nd player.. u can even play you against you
 cclaude42: Wait you can add players to that little "players" box&#160;?
 Waffle3z: was in 800th and added a line to save mana by avoiding using wind for defense unless there's an opponent hero nearby, gold opened while my submit was calculating
 cclaude42: I thought it was just me and boss
 JohnyDaison: not add, but delete and put someone else
 Waffle3z: conserving mana gained about 350 places though so I should end up in gold
 cclaude42: Ohhhhh cool! Had no idea
 VizGhar:  you can even swap position / color cclaude42
 Waffle3z: you can also delete yourself and run 2 other people against each other
 Dapps: everytime i tried conserving mana i did worse.. i basically let the bot do whatever it wants for now
 twopheek: had this change in my todo for a long time.
 twopheek: I will implement it to see :grinning:
 Kururugi: any new rules in gold?
 aCat: no new rules after bronze
 ashiknur: how many will advance to the gold?
 cclaude42: Does the rule "if you're better than the boss you're promoted" still apply here to us silvers&#160;?
 Kururugi: yes
 Kururugi: if your ranking is better
 cclaude42: Oh nice
 MichExpatMatt: Good morning, I see there is suddenly a silver boss
 Kururugi: not just boss
 cegprakash: ashiknur already about 400 are in gold and many are in submission phase.. so I'm guessing 1000 ppl on gold in next 1 or 2 hrs
 JohnyDaison: Does language choice affect execution time? Like if wrote the same thing in C++ rather than C#, would it automatically execute in less ms?
 jrke: boss was at 457 ner chio mentioned
 jrke: so maybe 700-800 in next 1-2 hrs
 Nerchio: jr ke yeah
 VizGhar: way too much
 Jerrasterix: JohnyDaison, yess since C++ is compiled 
 Nerchio: boss doesn't seem very strong but I mean its silver ^^
 Jerrasterix: now it is in 75
 JohnyDaison: so does it hold true even here on CodinGame? I don't know how they process our code.
 Jerrasterix: yup 
 JohnyDaison: Hmm, now seriously considering rewriting it from scratch in C++
 Jerrasterix: well do you have a calculation heavy sim&#160;?? if no, it is a waste 
 JohnyDaison: I don't, I have a heuristic ATM, but I wanna rewrite it to be more intelligent and I'm already at 20-30 ms range, so I'm thinking maybe it's worth it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like top 500 should end up in gold
 cegprakash: top 1000 will PatrickMcGinnisII I see 10 promotions a min at least
 cegprakash: it was like 380 4 mins back.. now it's 422
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm right near silver boss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so what is in gold plus the 50 above boss ~500
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have better code, but want to promote first
 aCat: aaand you are above ;p
 aCat: I'm 5 places below&#160;;]
 aCat: ouh, above&#160;:-)
 DomiKo: :smile_cat:
 MichExpatMatt: these ranks and scores are really moving this morning, I take it they are still filtering people into gold
 Amiral: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1e0b53a-5bcd-4144-bed5-c1afd671dd24">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1e0b53a-5bcd-4144-bed5-c1afd671dd24</a>
 Amiral: Is anyone facing an issue with the battles?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's wild mana not all mana
 BJD: the score is based on how much mana you earned outside your base, not your remaining mana
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my coffee machine has more wild mana
 Amiral: Oooh!! I miss that part, thanks for the explanation 
 Ratosh: "wild mana: mana gained outside the radius of your base. "
 NewCoder09: gold league is open 
 ClockSort: cool, i should be out of Wood 2 soon
 lolTempest: you can get out of wood 2 with the first video guide on the codingame youtube channel
 ClockSort: I'd rather get out of Wood 2 with DUCT MCTS
 lolTempest: understandable
 lolTempest: im just trying to finish the optimization path
 lolTempest: Im top 3% on the optimization leaderboard but they want me to be top 2% :C
 ClockSort: oh, interesting.
 ClockSort: we can't all be top 2%
 lolTempest: exactly
 lolTempest: i wish it was based on country rankings and not world rankings
 Clagus: any ideas how to defend vs CONTROL -&gt; SHIELD on high level monsters?
 VizGhar: actively look for opponent hero and deny him&#160;:)
 burnpanck: Clagus push the enemy hero away before it does CONTROL -&gt; SHIELD:grinning:
 Tuo: 2 heroes defend with early wind on spiders works
 Aramang: if its already happened double teaming the mob should be enough
 Tuo: danger with that is if you get stuck in own base and dont make any wild mana
 Aramang: youd only need 2 right near the end
 dbf: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: aCat your defense is good  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625539896">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625539896</a>
 Nerchio: "your defense is good" and you provider a replay where he loses
 Nerchio: :joy:
 lolTempest: i thought i was the only one who noticed that
 lolTempest: xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it is good tho, not a backhanded compliment
 aCat: these are just a few damn rules
 aCat: half of the constes and I still can;t decide heur or sim
 aCat: but thanks&#160;;-)
 aCat: I put some thought into this nevertheless ^^'
 Th1nhNg0: I'm currently training deep reinforcement Learning with the env that I use from java source code, and it look very promise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you make my ide code go to 220, and you farm better, so u win against me.  I may get a mob in there now and then, but u defend against my main att everytime
 Emmus: aCat, when you control, do you send the spiders to the opponents base?
 Th1nhNg0: my RL AI is winning 30% vs my current code xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm below boss again
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth
 Jerrasterix: you wrote a RL AI Th1nhNg0&#160;??
 aCat: Emmus nope
 aCat: I play ping pong&#160;;]
 Th1nhNg0: yes Jerrasterix
 aCat: sending them on diagonal, so I can farm them
 aCat: going on a perimeter of the base
 DollarAkshay: @Th1nhNg0 how many hours of offlijne training&#160;?
 aCat: that was the idea, but I will probably turn this part off&#160;:(
 Th1nhNg0: DollarAkshay 8 hour till now
 Emmus: Well try to send them to the opponent base, and see if it woks better&#160;:) your idea is also good&#160;;) @aCat
 DollarAkshay: @Th1nhNg0  Share some winningreplays. I am curious
 Th1nhNg0: I'm still dont know how to put it on codingame
 Th1nhNg0: because no library xD
 DollarAkshay: You have to put the weights and biases in the source code
 DollarAkshay: But the source code has a limit of 50k characters I think
 therealbeef: 100k
 JRFerguson: i don't quite understand this
 JRFerguson: After an entity moves towards a point, its coordinates are truncated (when below halfway across the map) or rounded up (when above halfway across the map)
 Th1nhNg0: hmm
 Th1nhNg0: I will try it
 JRFerguson: what does it mean "halfway across the map"&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: @JRFerguson it is truncated towards the origin point
 DollarAkshay: origin = middle point
 aCat: Emmus but such approaches end with not having manna
 aCat: I've seen such tries
 Wontonimo: half way&#160;?  like, the point at witch continuing to go towards the center results in you moving away&#160;?!?
 Wontonimo: aww ... I didn't get into Gold&#160;;(
 DollarAkshay: @Wontonimo I think you are talking about something else
 Wontonimo: I was responding to JRFerguson
 l10r: Did anyone encounter a problem where he didn't get the opponent heros?\
 Wontonimo: when going towards the center of something, once you get half way across it you are now going away from the center
 Wontonimo: I was trolling, if that wasn't clear
 Emmus: |10r like the coordinates of the heros?
 DollarAkshay: @l10r Yeah once you reach Wood 1, there is fog of war you cant see everything
 l10r: @DollarAkshay thanks!
 Jerrasterix: I have a doubt, how did you guys manage to individually constrol the units
 DollarAkshay: Jerrasterix you can use the CONTROLL spell
 JRFerguson: i still don't get that trouncated and rounded up rule
 JRFerguson: can someone post a pseudocode&#160;?
 Jerrasterix: I am talking about controlling my own units as different ones
 JRFerguson: *truncated
 DollarAkshay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java</a>
 aCat: search referee
 DollarAkshay: The symetricTruncate function in this file
 aCat: yeh, there it is&#160;:-)
 JRFerguson: yeah, that uses functions that i don't get what are doing
 Shrimpster: Whats up people!!
 cagriy: hello from ISTANBUL &lt;3
 Shrimpster: Hello Istanbul! Sherefe! 
 Shrimpster: :beer:
 DaNinja: for symmetric truncate I used if (x&lt;width/2) ceil(x) else floor(x)
 Murat_Eroglu: Cheers komsu
 DaNinja: not sure if its correct, but results seem to match the next turn inputs
 JRFerguson: DaNinja, thanks. It seems to be the opposite to what i understand the rules say, but i will try it that way
 Waffle3z: heroes move before monsters, so if a hero is within 1600 units of a monster, it can move directly towards it and hit it on the same turn, right?
 Nerchio: yes
 BJD: yes
 aCat: yes
 Waffle3z: yes
 ARKAquatic: yes
 BrunoFelthes: yes
 Dapps: maybe
 Waffle3z: trying to position the hero between 2 monsters so it hits both of them, but it keeps missing one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625568820">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625568820</a> around frame 70
 Waffle3z: it only goes in-between if the distance between the 2 monsters is less than 1600
 JRFerguson: take into account that heros move first, then damage is computed, and then monsters move
 Nerchio: looks too far
 rcrl: Hey Waffle3z, make sure the distance between your hero and the destination is less than 800 units
 ashiknur: what is the rank of boss4 now?
 rcrl: Else he will go too far
 rcrl: (Kudos for using LUA)
 ceggart: 30.62
 Waffle3z: kinda unbelievable how it whiffed that purple monster at frame 80, I can see the sword animation go through the spider <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625584756">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625584756</a>
 Waffle3z: ig the animation doesn't exactly represent the state
 DollarAkshay: The attack is calculated before the monster moves
 DollarAkshay: Waffle3z 
 avdg: hmm silver boss seems easy for me and I'm not yet in gold
 Nerchio: you won't be gold without submit
 avdg: ah and I discovered a bug in my bot that I want to fix first :p
 avdg: but my bot still can beat it though without the fix
 Nerchio: you need to beat others too, not just  the boss
 MeWhenI: where can i find the puzzle of the week?
 TobiasA: Damn I don't think I have strategy I reach gold:disappointed_relieved:
 TobiasA: but at the same time I want to reach legend 
 avdg: hmm mine mostly gains it strength by defending
 TobiasA: what the hell am I typing
 avdg: the planner is quite simple strat, but some code planning is required compared to ah-this-one-goes-there
 aatj: Is there a cut off for gold league, or can we continue to improve the bot if we miss the threshold at the first sort?
 avdg: just beat the boss, nothing more
 avdg: as long as your bot confronts it in the arena
 aatj: Ah, I thought you had to get above the ranking of the boss.
 avdg: yeah, if you win you go above
 eulerscheZahl: where did my last battles go? doesn't even show 50 of them
 avdg: though if you rank lower than the boss a few times too much, you will not gain leages either
 therealbeef: after submit, after 100% of battle done, if rating &gt; boss rating then you promote, simple as that
 aatj: Thanks.
 therealbeef: well, even after 100%, if you are lower rating, but then someone beats the boss a few times and lowers its rating to below yours, you still promote
 avdg: probably depend on point of measurement
 avdg: because I had it a few times as well
 avdg: accidently bump
 therealbeef: the point of measurement is any time after you've played the necessary number of matches
 Th1nhNg0: I think only cast spell after specific turn is a better strategy
 avdg: hmm I loose my games now against the ai after I made my fix
 LLG: yeah I save up mana for a big push
 LLG: unless if I absolutely have to use it defensively
 avdg: basically I had a bot that didn't move when it started on the bottom right
 avdg: and now I fixed it, I loose games
 avdg: hmm I had an off by 1 bug in a weird way because of refactorings at a few places
 Th1nhNg0: how the rank system work? is it in the codingame FAQ
 eulerscheZahl: TrueSkill algorithm
 Th1nhNg0: thanks
 Westicles: trivia question... how many of the 50+ CG contests have been won by americans?
 lolTempest: 37
 lolTempest: random guess
 eulerscheZahl: 0? other random guess
 Westicles: euler got it
 lolTempest: zamn
 eulerscheZahl: but how many by French players?
 lolTempest: 20
 lolTempest: 29**
 TobiasA: 600
 eulerscheZahl: Canada got a few thanks to a single user. but 2nd place in country rating is probably Russia
 ryannnn: im streaming clash of codes with my chat if anyone wants to join in? twitch.tv/ryantupo
 lolTempest: I would join it ryannnnn but im on my school computer :C
 Westicles: good for you ryannnn, touching balls just got approved maybe you'll get it
 lolTempest: :skull:
 lolTempest: im dead
 Westicles: ooh, thanks lolTempest
 lolTempest: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like imma stay in silver w/o resubmit cause boss pulls my defenders
 lolTempest: unfortunate
 cegprakash: lol PatrickMcGinnisII
 cegprakash: shield urself -_-
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea just enabled that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i didn't wanna resub, too many in silver
 cegprakash: rank?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: about 7th when everyone finally promotes
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, seems the low game count is only for today
 eulerscheZahl: i see. screenshot time because it gave me a high rank
 eulerscheZahl: oh, nevermind. already dropped again
 Illedan: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: silly boss4 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625624377">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625624377</a>
 eulerscheZahl: just need to get lucky with rank fluctuation when legend opens
 burnpanck: I hate this game. This morning I completed a full MCTS, using a value function that sees everything, with the goal to train a NN player. Then, I did just a tiny improvement to make my stupid heuristic bot make it to gold; and now I'm at Rank 9 - without using anything but WIND. And I even beat blaster: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625622128">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625622128</a>
 burnpanck: (once)
 Illedan: Lol
 RIPS10: This is a good way to learn a new language :grinning:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now I'm right below boss again, probably geet pushed into gold if i wait
 VizGhar: PatrickMcGinnisII just wait... this boss is week, somebody will pull him down
 VizGhar: I can beat him 90% of time, but loosing to other bots :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ide bot is better, but trudging thru 2.6k silver bots is not ideal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh crap, just got promoted, tx CG gods
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 elisaado: hello world
 SirLoxley: the things you learn while doing codingame ... never would have heard about LiangBarsky algorithm
 TobiasA: LiangBarsky alogorithm?
 SirLoxley: given a rectangle and a(n intersecting) line, tell me where it intersects
 jacek: geometry :scream:
 jacek: and why do you need it
 Nerchio: :grin:
 lolTempest: :laughing:
 Nerchio: stay away from geometry not worth it
 SirLoxley: I want to know where the critters would leave the map
 eulerscheZahl: hey Nerchio, any plans to finish your submit and promote to gold before legend opening?
 SirLoxley: to avoid pursuing a critter which isn't worth it
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl if codingame gods allow
 Illedan: xD
 SirLoxley: still working on defense only ... which got me to gold league
 PatrickMcGinnisII: legend will take an almost complete rewrite for me
 Illedan: I need 2 rewrites for legend
 eulerscheZahl: did you reach legend before Patrick?
 VizGhar: I need to start writing&#160;:|
 Nerchio: not going to lie i mostly fix bugs instead of code something useful
 eulerscheZahl: i procrastinate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl hmm, not during a contest...maybe after when it went multi... dunno would have to look
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling that legend is doable for you this contest
 Illedan: :door: I'm out of this contest for a few days. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625636614">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625636614</a>
 JB5: wild mana, is it obtained from attacking monsters outside 5000 units from home base?  or 6000 units?
 Dapps: lol that's quite a statement game Illedan
 VizGhar: :D
 Illedan: I submitted that Dapps
 Dapps: :joy:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, Line Racing.  forgot original name of it
 Nerchio: i am afraid it will win some games Illedan
 Illedan: Sadly
 jacek: tron
 Illedan: Bye for now
 jacek: oO
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yeah i need achievments
 eulerscheZahl: that came unexpected
 eulerscheZahl: easier to burn bridges and do a rewrite when you don't permanently look at the ranking?
 Illedan: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: blocking the rank in the IDE with an ad blocker also helps
 Illedan: I tried, didn't work
 Illedan: In every game I'm looking at. All I have to do is to fix a stupid IF and I win
 JB5: is wild mana obtained outside 5000 units from home base or 6000 units?
 BJD: 5000
 JB5: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've never been competitive on here like that.  The process is the fun.  lthough despite my crappy lang. (*cough*) still haven't gotten top 4 in lang
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er top 3, i think achievvment is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or is it just 1st?
 eulerscheZahl: top1, 3, 10there are multiple
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top 10 in USA would be a good goal for me on this contest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when it's done recalculating me, I'll submit with newest version a bit later
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I gotten drive my daughter 3 hours round trip now tho.  So yall glhf.
 Nerchio: I simulate bugs for 75 turns but 2 different controls took its speed down to like 5 pixels so I reached the end of the array 
 Nerchio: I somehow thought bugs will always do 400 steps if they can
 Waffle3z: don't they? take the position and add the velocity and that's their position on the next turn
 eulerscheZahl: we should suggest a rule change so that they really move with 5 pixel per turn
 eulerscheZahl: would make it easier to defend
 Waffle3z: new rules in legend. monsters don't move. you have to use wind to send them at your opponent
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i need to sim defending variations and separately attacking variations ... the issue is fog prediction.  I'll think abou it on my drive
 kovi: but you cant see them...unless it is possible to wind out them from spawn?
 Nerchio: I was thinking about writing in-base sim for most optimal movement but I guess that shouldnt happen too often should focus on other things
 blasterpoard: kovi it was possible, now it shouldn't be
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rule change...hmm only 1 i can think of is the simultaneous Control and Shield...mobs should take damage and heros...maybe move 1/2 distance of con
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll shuttup
 eulerscheZahl: only control 1 hero each turn instead of all 3 at once
 Westicles: screen needs to wrap around
 eulerscheZahl: torus?
 jacek: torus?
 jacek: :x
 eulerscheZahl: so the bases are connected
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i got an echo
 Nerchio: oh, i got an echo
 eulerscheZahl: i totally saw this coming. just expected it to be from jacek
 msumera: new rules in leged: heroes have health and can be attacked by enemies and monsters
 NewCoder09: oh thats cool
 JasonMep: hi guys
 NewCoder09: hi
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Nerchio: take me out of silver pls I don't want to butcher them anymore
 rcrl: That kind of butcher&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/625670318">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/625670318</a>
 Nerchio: rcrl legend
 rcrl: ;D
 Nerchio: but you are too far down we don't play any meaningful games 
 Nerchio: :sunglasses:
 rcrl: I just re-run ;D
 Nerchio: redirect into my own base into a loss <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625683532">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625683532</a>
 Nerchio: legendary
 LaurensD: haha, did not know you can yeet them outside
 Nerchio: yeah its spectacular for sure
 Nerchio: goodbye silver peeps :kissing_heart:
 dbf: tried to stay for them as long as possible?&#160;:)
 Charwie: Woah
 Charwie: so many smart people
 LaurensD: haha
 LaurensD: lucky gold boi
 LaurensD: will probably be for a while at silver
 awesomedude123: guys I need some helo
 awesomedude123: I am doing this practice code and for some reason my conversion from char to binary is not working
 awesomedude123: Mainly, converting&#160;% to binary is not working as well another test case which I believe would work if I solve this issue. pretty much, when converting, I get the string 100101 but the "right" string according to the answer is 0110101. I am not sure how that is right as I am not getting it at all
 LaurensD: @nerchio you wild mana beast <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625692324">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625692324</a>
 awesomedude123: the first two test cases passed with my code for letters
 jacek: awesomedude123 its always 7 bits long. add leading zeroes if needed
 awesomedude123: ohhh
 awesomedude123: is that for each one?
 Nerchio: LaurensD take notes
 awesomedude123: thank you so much
 awesomedude123: i was stuck on that for two days and was confused
 jacek: :tada:
 dbf: nice trick from #2 - no defence and triple wind
 Wontonimo: "Boss 4"&#160;?!?  That is so unimaginative 
 Nerchio: so we don't get info about monsters until they are inside the map zone? like x &lt; 0 no info
 LaurensD: @nerchio ~ throwing the enemy outside as fast as possible to get more wilds, looks delicious ~ made a little tweak for the monster controlling, they could have at least a certain amount of health
 Nerchio: yeah the health thing i dont know I lose games to monsters with low hp pushed into my base
 Nerchio: cause i dont cast spells on them
 Waffle3z: strategy idea: use wind spells to round up your opponent's heroes and trap them in a corner if they never shield themselves
 Nerchio: and you will spam wind to keep them there? :D
 Waffle3z: yes
 Waffle3z: then use your other 2 heroes to farm enough mana to keep it going
 Dapps: seems like it could be the new meta
 Nerchio: i dont think it would ever work and they can shield themselves too you know :D
 Waffle3z: right, but who does that right now
 LaurensD: me
 LaurensD: randomly
 LaurensD: lol
 Waffle3z: collect enough mana to afford the set up, dedicate one hero to the corner, use the others to guide the opponent's 3 heroes into that corner, then maybe you can skip farming/defense and just try to kill them
 LaurensD: make a hyperloop with 3 heroes (wind tunnel ):joy:
 TobiasA: phew it was close but i'm now clear for gold:relieved:
 Waffle3z: 754 computing
 Waffle3z: another strategy idea: save up a ton of mana, then send 3 monsters toward the opponent's base and control spam their heroes so they can't move or shield themselves
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625714299">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625714299</a>
 LaurensD: pretty crazy match =P
 LaurensD: well, mostly struggling
 LaurensD: need to make some mana checks
 LaurensD: wasting turns&#160;:/
 LaurensD: what is health? above mana?
 LaurensD: it seems always to return 3
 jacek: baby dont hurt me
 jacek: if spider attacks your base, you lose 1 health
 daffie: how many monsters can enter your base before you lose
 LaurensD: oh
 avdg: hmm lots of winds back and forth <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/148873935174525/?multi_permalinks=5249679541760580">https://www.facebook.com/groups/148873935174525/?multi_permalinks=5249679541760580</a>
 LaurensD: those heart, haha
 daffie: attack your base I mean
 avdg: I like how the ai keeps my defenders away from the monsters
 LaurensD: I assume you are dutch then
 LaurensD: hehe
 avdg: I'm closest to being dutch while being not dutch I guess
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625725571">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625725571</a> what i dislike about the game, i didnt get info about mind controlled bug that was turned around into my base at 108
 Nerchio: I don't know I guess you could deduct from enemy mana and them standing in place that something was casted
 NewCoder09: Hey Nerchio
 daffie: "If an entity is being moved via a WIND from multiple sources at once, it will move to the sum of all given directions."
 dloukadakis: yes
 aCat: no
 aCat: about half of the map
 aatj: Pretty aggressive strategy: from skotz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625729223">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625729223</a>
 daffie: the aggro range of the base is 5000 units and wind spell pushes a monster 2200 units, 3 heros casting would make the sum 6600 units?
 dloukadakis: u can push a monster 6600 away
 dloukadakis: assuming all the heroes are within 6600 of enemy base they can push it all the way in
 daffie: yea so it is possible to push it into their base far enough to damage it
 Waffle3z: if wind is used on a monster, does it still move on its own at the end of the turn?
 daffie: yea except if it's pushed out of the base then it goes in a random direction
 Waffle3z: so if a monster was moving directly toward the enemy base, 3 heroes could blow it from 7300 units away and damage the base on the same turn?
 _NikJ: yes Waffle3z
 daffie: thats what I am wondering
 Waffle3z: and the heroes could be standing 800 units away from the monster, so they take a life from 8100 units away
 _NikJ: It's been tested, if you put 6 heroes in the same spot and cast wind, monster flies into base sonic speed
 Waffle3z: your opponent probably will not cooperate
 daffie: lol sounds like an OP strategy 
 _NikJ: well obviously not, we just wanted to show how broken it is :D
 _NikJ: but yes, if you can get 3 heroes in the center of the map, you can score a goal from there
 Waffle3z: from 800 units away, blow the spider 6600 units ahead and then it walks another 400 and stops 300 units from the base and damages it
 _NikJ: because you know, 3 players can kick 1 ball 3 times as strong as one 
 _NikJ: aka 9 women can give birth to a baby in 1 month
 Waffle3z: not only that, the heroes could have been 1600 away at the start of the turn
 Wontonimo: sounds like a new meta
 Mindarius: sounds fun
 Waffle3z: so really you could be 8900 units away from the enemy base and still damage it
 NewCoder09: Wontonimo where have you been?
 Waffle3z: walk 800 towards a spider 1600 away, blow it 6600 forward, then it walks 400 and lands within 300 units of the base
 <b>**Wontonimo looks left, looks right, stares blankly forward, shurgs </b></p><p><img src="/a/41786526997017" /> daffie: OP
 Waffle3z: oh, wind range is 1280, so you could do it from 9380 units away
 _NikJ: his beard's gotten even more gray or rather white
 Waffle3z: 1280+800+6600+400+300
 Nerchio: you could also push bugs into your own base surely they wont expect it
 Waffle3z: you only need to blow monsters beyond the opponent's reach, not even directly into the goal
 LaurensD: oh god what the hell is it doing lol
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625740553">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625740553</a>
 LaurensD: seems like because I'm to far from my base the enemy can crawl in&#160;:/
 LaurensD: avoiding detection?
 Waffle3z: if a monster is pushed inside the radius of a base, does it target the base immediately on the same turn, or will it still move with the same velocity it had at the start of the turn?
 Waffle3z: if you blow it to the edge of the base, could it immediately walk out right afterwards in the same turn, or will it then walk another 400 towards the base
 Uemu: Hello, I don't get the "Spells are cast in the order of the received output" thing,  if my first input is a self shield and enemy's first input is a control spell on my hero, what would happen&#160;? 
 aCat: its not about this
 aCat: the order of applying is as in statement 1 2 3 4 5
 aCat: but your mana spent is in order
 aCat: which is I suppose not actually trube but meh
 aCat: the ordering is pretty well descibed
 aCat: (in order of your heroes I meant but not surre of this)
 Uemu: Sorry if I didn't get your point by I'm asking about cases where my first hero and the enemy's first hero cast spells at the same time, would his control work first or my shield on the unit he's trying to control&#160;? 
 daffie: his control
 aatj: It doesn't depend on who is blue?
 msumera: controls casted in the same turn are summed and applied in the next turn
 daffie: control is applied before shield is applied
 Uemu: Thank you 
 Mattant: Is it really going to judge my bot for two hours now?
 Iugi: but you still get the shield
 Iugi: uemu
 jacek: its always slow when they open new league
 Nerchio: its always slow
 Bbrainstormer: regions are awesome
 Mattant: I'm not even in the new league tho
 LaurensD: well haha
 LaurensD: had a nice little skip in my code, where I always skipped the first monster
 LaurensD: so it was always leaving one monster alone that'll likely get into my base :grin::joy:
 cegprakash: well first monster is a trial monster anyway
 LaurensD: :joy:
 cegprakash: only 30 games in gold league for 100% computation -_-
 cegprakash: admins care more about silver league now -_- 
 jacek: silver is cheaper
 avdg: hmm the silver bot exposes some of my very hidden bugs
 avdg: didn't had many bugs earlier, but the bugs are relative small
 avdg: now the issue is that my defends code works well enough, that my attacker gets in front, unknowingly that it should stay away from monsters near enemy base
 avdg: so basically, my ai attacks monsters going to opponent base
 LaurensD: the boss 4 is pretty annoying
 Dapps: easy fix is to use the threatfor field
 Waffle3z: 781 computing
 struct: nice
 struct: The bug has been fixed :D
 jacek: hm?
 struct: the threatFor bug I reported
 struct: where vx and vy did not get updated after control
 struct: but threatFor was getting updated
 yhyoxx: yay
 Waffle3z: gold league rank 1/2587
 Waffle3z: there it goes, took a moment to update
 struct: grats
 cegprakash: even siman stuck at 28th rank coz of less games in gold
 Waffle3z: battle progress 33% already?
 LaurensD: congrats
 cegprakash: only 30 games in total Waffle3z
 struct: They said they will add more games once servers can handle
 struct: it
 cegprakash: to speed up Silver servers lol
 Astrobytes: there will be more games in gold when the servers calm down a bit
 struct: its only fair
 Waffle3z: is default always the same as the boss of the previous league?
 jacek: plot twist: never
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: yes Waffle3z
 cegprakash: default bot is usually weaker than the boss on previous league
 struct: I think it depends
 struct: So not always I guess
 Astrobytes: it is mostly, I believe
 Astrobytes: ie. the previous league boss
 Astrobytes: which will surely seem weak once you've passed it...
 cegprakash: can I move/use spells when I'm under controlled spell?
 struct: I would try it
 struct: Maybe its buged and you can do it
 struct: Since bug fixes was released there must be some new features
 Astrobytes: :D
 cegprakash: ok it says overrides.. so no matter what I print it's like a WAIT action
 Yanek: is the bottom-right base at (17630, 9000) or (17629, 8999)? I'm off by one pixel in my simulations 
 struct: The inputs say 17630
 struct: Im not sure if I can trust it though
 Waffle3z: ig that's why it rounds up on one half and down on the other half
 axel2103: hey LOL
 BenThor414: hola beaner
 Waffle3z: which way does it round in the middle?
 axel2103: stop it!
 BenThor414: I know Axels mom
 Astrobytes: kid alert
 struct: Stop spamming
 Yanek: It's not symmettric really if it's at 17630. Y=0 is part of the map but Y=17630 is considered outside of bounds
 axel2103: his name is ben
 Counterbalance: player 2 base was outside of the map, now the map width is actually 17631 etc.. in most places.. it's quite inconsistent
 axel2103: his moms name is lisa
 Nerchio: we could protect ourselves from bugs but not from this
 BenThor414: My deepest apologies seniors, I will proceed to stop talking
 struct: yes you will
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 LaurensD: Master senior for you, my little pedawan :nerd:
 LaurensD: Jk Jk
 LAGA97: Hello, does it happen your code is correct but the test keep returning wrong outputs&#160;?
 struct: not really
 LaurensD: you are supposed to always send output in order, perhaps you missed one? \
 jacek: your code is incorrect then
 jacek: additional new line or space at the end
 LAGA97: its impossible because i copied paste in other IDE , working like a charm
 Yanek: oh, they fixed the symmetry 5 hours ago. I was referencing old code :v
 LAGA97: anyways i thought someone working here could give me some explanations
 jacek: what do you print and what do they expect
 Astrobytes: did you miss a space, newline etc
 Astrobytes: or indeed, add one
 LAGA97: they always print 0 
 LAGA97: if u can look at my last clash , i shared the code..
 Astrobytes: we can't
 cegprakash: I'm at a sexy 69th rank
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/ihilyn7469l41.jpg">https://i.redd.it/ihilyn7469l41.jpg</a>
 LaurensD: 1371 rank, nearly 1337
 LaurensD: Boss 4 feels impossible lol
 LaurensD: pretty sure it's stronger now than it was when it got released :upside_down:
 Tuo: nice game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625823635">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625823635</a>
 Tuo: number of the beast x 2
 Tuo: and a first Tie i have ever seen
 SemChumboPT: how do you print the code on top of your player on the challenge?
 cegprakash: cout&lt;&lt;"MOVE "&lt;&lt;x&lt;&lt;" "&lt;&lt;y&lt;&lt;" "&lt;&lt;your code&lt;&lt;endl; SemChumboPT
 Astrobytes: in other words, append a space followed by what you want to output to your command, followed by a newline
 SemChumboPT: thanks
 LaurensD: time to give up

 Astrobytes: Remember when the bosses (And contests) had names? Good times
 DomiKo: Good old times&#160;:(
 Tuo: LaurensD less shield and more wind and you would do ok
 blasterpoard: less defense, more attack
 Tuo: that too&#160;:)
 avdg: I should focus on attack more too
 avdg: Made my defence less strict already today on some conditions
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625843918">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625843918</a> #1 vs #3 looks like this; tells you how far you get by defending passively
 Tuo: defense get boring after a while, still many in gold top 200 full 3 hero defense :unamused:
 avdg: This is my bot now <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625845511">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625845511</a>
 Nerchio: Tuo only way
 ThomasNicoullaud: 100% winrate blasterpoard, you broke the game
 Astrobytes: :D
 avdg: actually my defense is almost becoming an attack in some areas
 blasterpoard: ThomasNicoullaud I submitted a bad bot everyone optimized against yesterday, now I changed it a bit
 blasterpoard: and everyone needs new ifs again
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 ThomasNicoullaud: wait the last minute :D
 Abdi-29: yooo is someone doing the codingame in python?
 Astrobytes: nobody at all
 SemChumboPT: me, trying it for the first time on the spring challenge
 avdg: typescript here
 blasterpoard: too bad gold has so few games now, this bot could go really far up
 Astrobytes: blasterpoard: games will increase when the servers are quieter :D
 Abdi-29: i just need a tip to make the hero to not attack the spider already targeted 
 Astrobytes: apparently CG suddenly became dynamic wrt battle count during contests
 SemChumboPT: what that has to do with python?
 avdg: my bot doesn't mind having 2 near the same monster, mostly it means faster kill
 avdg: though it shouldn't put 2 heroes on 1 monster for now (in some scenario you still want to though)
 Tuo: you get mana for both hits right?
 SemChumboPT: yes I saw one guy that was placing all 3 heroes on the same spider if he had no other spider near
 Astrobytes: yes Tuo
 Tuo: so the only problem is that after that spider dies both heroes are idle
 Tuo: not that bad
 avdg: well, the more your ai idles, the better, in the sense it has time to do other things, the bad part, you need new tasks
 ThomasNicoullaud: have a good night blasterpoard :D
 ZarthaxX: astrobyto
 avdg: hmm my basic attack logic is not effective at all now it seems
 avdg: probably an upgrade for tomorrow
 avdg: monday evening: code cleanup, this evening defence, tomorrow attack and planning
 Astrobytes: yo Zartho
 ZarthaxX: mah mann
 ZarthaxX: i just finished the final exaem 20 mins ago
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 ZarthaxX: god it was hell but 1 out of 2 done hehe
 Astrobytes: Nice one brother!
 Astrobytes: Almost there&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: gotta hold a bit more
 ZarthaxX: and blaster destroyed the contest meanwhile, ok :rofl
 Astrobytes: yeah, you got this, don't lose the focus
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah
 ZarthaxX: yeeees, will take a little break tho
 Astrobytes: of course, clear the head a lil bit
 Astrobytes: time with gf &amp; fam, chill time
 ZarthaxX: time to cg to clear my mind (?
 ZarthaxX: *goes wrong*
 Astrobytes: well.... if you feel so inclined :D
 ZarthaxX: i got the theory that doing cg to "rest" is not actually resting
 ZarthaxX: you end quite stressed
 ZarthaxX: even more on contests ofc
 Astrobytes: You are correct
 ZarthaxX: so sad programming requires thinking
 ZarthaxX: hehe
 Astrobytes: It's more of a 'recreational pursuit' :D
 cegprakash: too much rock paper scissor in gold
 ZarthaxX: accurate definition right there
 ZarthaxX: astro shooting for that goldie?
 ZarthaxX: hi ceg
 blasterpoard: cegprakash I don't see any
 cegprakash: I tune my bot against two attackers now it doesn't do that good against regular players
 cegprakash: like shield players
 cegprakash: coz I protect the double push
 cegprakash: but shield players come
 Astrobytes: meh, still old code I just keep adding stuff too/removing, servers only recently became responsive again. I have a rewrite on t he go but not motivated much
 ZarthaxX: uh&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: the contest lacks cg past contests right
 Astrobytes: Yes
 ZarthaxX: the boss names is heartbreaking
 ZarthaxX: that part specially
 Astrobytes: lol, kind of a minor issue but contributes to the overall feel I'd say
 Astrobytes: whole thing smells of lack of effort and willingness. Not their fault I guess with their now limited resources. At least we have a contest.
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: why limited resources tho?
 ZarthaxX: im not up to date
 yhyoxx: cg should hire top players 
 Astrobytes: All but one (at last count) staff were working solely on CG for Work (the business side), the free CG we know is not a priority.
 Astrobytes: Makes sense ofc
 yhyoxx: or atleast ask them for input
 ZarthaxX: oh... ok&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: since the acquisition by CoderPad etc
 Astrobytes: It's cool for them as a company just sad to see the community part going downhill
 ZarthaxX: that day always come sadly&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: comes*
 Astrobytes: yeah, indeed
 ZarthaxX: had the same problem with a card game i liked, and now it's ded
 avdg: community can always outbreak, as long as there are enough resources not stuck within the company
 Astrobytes: building a platform is a massive effort, plus server costs etc
 avdg: oh yeah, ofc, other costs
 Astrobytes: and that's before even running a contest (hiring extra servers etc)
 Astrobytes: It was amazing while it lasted, for that at least I'm thankful&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: yup
 ZarthaxX: the sad part is no other platform has come to be like cg
 Astrobytes: Yeah. There are other competitions but nothing comes close
 ZarthaxX: right&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Not the end of the world dude, life goes on&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: what matters is the friends we made in the journey
 ZarthaxX: or smth like that
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: *when i see you again*
 ZarthaxX: aight stahp
 ZarthaxX: hehe
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: continue coding astro!
 Astrobytes: going to bed in 10 mins
 ZarthaxX: good night then hehe
 Astrobytes: not enough hours in a day to make more than 1 full submit
 ZarthaxX: gotta close this chat to achieve that
 Astrobytes: server time I mean
 ZarthaxX: i thought you meant that too
 ZarthaxX: but both apply
 ZarthaxX: hehe
 Astrobytes: i only chat here when I'm doing unimportant things
 ZarthaxX: you are  better than me then
 Astrobytes: lol, mostly :Danyways, I'll see you later dude, take care
 ZarthaxX: take care mah man!
 Hamp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/625870567">https://www.codingame.com/replay/625870567</a> I beat him :O (one time)
 struct: nice
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 blasterpoard: Hamp my bot assumes the bots I'm playing agains won't have 2 heroes in their corner without being forced to...
 blasterpoard: just fog of war things
 ZarthaxX: hi structo!
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 Wontonimo: i'm sad.  my basic bot that hasn't had any improvements since Friday and is basically "hit closest thing" didn't make it to gold.
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 avdg: my bot wins sometimes against the ai, which I guess isn't enough to proceed
 Wontonimo: no.  you need to beat everyone below also
 yord47: anyone can confirm if shield works on your hero&#160;?
 Wontonimo: confirmed
 yord47: okay ty i dont see the shield when appliedwhich seems strange
 Waffle3z: worried about having heroes go to the edge of the range of a monster and being 1 unit out of range due to rounding
 struct: just make there hero range be 799
 yhyoxx: 799 as the range to be able to attack a monster&#160;?
 yhyoxx: yes, just checked the rules
 Waffle3z: or binary search for a target coordinate that works instead of doing it nicely in a single calculation
 yhyoxx: or perfect coodinates using maths 
 struct: the range is 800 yhyoxx
 yhyoxx: yes, 800 - 1 to avoid rounding errors
 Waffle3z: calculate and then check if it's 1 off and then adjust by 1 unit in each direction
 Waffle3z: I can calculate the trajectory for the hero to precisely intercept the monster at its center, but really I only need to get 800 away from it, which means not going as far, which means the monster doesn't go as far, which means the time to intercept is shorter, which means the calculation is different
 SashaNukem: If I control a monster and set it in the direction of enemy base will it also change threatFor to 2?
 BJD: yes
 BrunoFelthes: the control command will block the action this turn, and move the next turn? or do not block the action this turn?
 SashaNukem: Thank you
 SashaNukem: I have not used the control spell but I think there is no reson for it to block since wind does not block either 
 BrunoFelthes: what means when I receive that my hero "isControlled"?
 JRFerguson: hi bruno, only blocks next turn
 JRFerguson: if is controlled his action on this turn won't get executed
 BrunoFelthes: and the action that i did at the turn that i receive the controll, was executed?
 JRFerguson: yes
 MarcelHJ: What's changed in gold league?
 Waffle3z: the boss
 icecream17: I'm in wood 1, what's new in the future leagues?
 struct: spells
 Waffle3z: did wood 1 introduce fog of war I skipped it
 EvModder: [ GET A JOB ]
 EvModder: the button is mocking me
 mybk: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 mybk: I need a job&#160;:'( 
 EvModder: apply to 600613
 mybk: what's that&#160;? 
 EvModder: google in 1337 (leet) speak 
 Tuo: what happens if you answer the CG "want a job" question?
 Tuo: do they actually ever offer a job?
 EvModder: not sure, but my guess it it sends your info to a recruiter for one of CG's sponsor companies
 EvModder: if it works anything like other job-finding websites, CG probably gets a $ bonus for anyone they recommend who ends up getting hired
 EvModder: (like a referral bonus)
 Westicles: they said on discord they are discontinuing that
 EvModder: ah ok
 EvModder: so the button will stop taunting me&#160;:)
 Tuo: sad times no jobs to be had&#160;:( good thing tho no-one will ever read my crappy AI code :D
 kresteodymium: hi
 EvModder: ai code was never meant to be pretty lol
 EvModder: there's something beautiful about ugly code (self-contradictory, but i dont mind)
 EvModder: alright, code talk time:does SHIELD protect from WIND spell?
 WannaBeHum1n: yes
 kresteodymium: yes
 kresteodymium: pfc

 EvModder: ok, i wasn't sure because wind doesnt have a target entity id
 EvModder: per documentation: "The target entity cannot be targeted by spells for the next 12 rounds. "
 EvModder: i'll test it just to be sure but i think you guys are right
 EvModder: can confirm, shield blocks wind, which makes sense :D
 Tuo: wind targets everyone(exept your own heroes) in 1280 radius

 DaNinja: JRFerguson did you get symetric trunc working?
 JRFerguson: hey DaNinja, i still have some issue
 JRFerguson: sometimes my rounding/truncation doesn't work and i get 1 pixel of difference
 JRFerguson: but it does the job for now
 DaNinja: yep, same
 JRFerguson: anyways i'm not sure what to do with my sim engine yet so i'm tweeking my heuristics bot
 andyyyyy: Are you guys pros?
 andyyyyy: I kind of get stuck on thinking what to do
 JRFerguson: we all do andy&#160;;)
 JRFerguson: check the starter kits
 JRFerguson: start simple, test ideas and you add complexity as you gain understanding from watching games
 andyyyyy: The thing is that i'm not creative, I think i have a decent grasp of programming (500+ solved on leetcode for example) but when it comes down to many things i get very stumped
 andyyyyy: and easily confused...
 JRFerguson: divide and conquer
 JRFerguson: don't try to program a complex bot, start with some basics
 andyyyyy: Fair enough I guess I just need to think of building blocks for it to start

 ASM_MOV_INT: what was everyone's first computer? and/or first computer they programmed on? at home/school or work?
 __Peaker__: hiiii
 ASM_MOV_INT: :bird: hi
 vespyer: hiii
 tekki: hi vespyer
 vespyer: hello tekki
 therealbeef: Philips P2000 for me, in late 80s. you had to insert a cartridge which contained a microsoft basic interpreter into a slot on top. 32k ram, no storage, had to load all programs of those mini casette tapes
 ASM_MOV_INT: looks like a Texas Instruments, and yeah very similar, I had cartridges too.... 
 ASM_MOV_INT: nice
 therealbeef: it used a graphics system similar to what teletext used

 michalwa: yo is there a way to persist stderr beyond the last line on failure
 Ryuuk: Hi All
 Ryuuk: is it possible to add photo in problem statment of a contribution please&#160;? 
 DaNinja: Not possible for CoC and Classic puzzles I think
 Stilgart: I think it is possible for puzzle if you choose to make a "solo game"
 Stilgart: but this requires to master the SDK from CG and to code in Java
 darkhorse64: At least for multiplayer games, adding a picture in the statement does not require Java programming
 ASM_MOV_INT: you could add an ASCII ART photo
 ASM_MOV_INT: anyone here know python?
 5DN1L: Is that information collection? :smirk:
 ASM_MOV_INT: ValueError: substring not found
 ASM_MOV_INT: I'm working on a problem, and half way through it gives me this, from &lt;string&gt;.index() command
 5DN1L: the line which causes the error?
 ASM_MOV_INT: yes
 ASM_MOV_INT: but the substring that it's finding should be at index 0 when it gets to this line
 5DN1L: what do you want to do actually?
 5DN1L: if you use find instead of index
 5DN1L: and the substring is not found
 5DN1L: it will give you -1 instead of error
 ASM_MOV_INT: cool, but the thing is, the substring should be found
 5DN1L: what are the string and substring then
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm doing prefix code challenge, and with each iteration as it finds the code, i set the string equal to the substring without the prefix code
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm working through the first test

 Wontonimo: ^^ that is a lot better
 Scarfield: test
 Scarfield: test
 struct: maybe you want repeat(i)
 struct: instead of x
 antiwonto: [automated] Scarfield please don't repeat yourself
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: seems like CG could make something like this if they wanted it
 nesnes112: struct it works but it displays only 2 stars  on line 1 for x=2
 struct: what should it display?
 Scarfield: ah didnt get kicked, i like your idea of this bot wonto&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: thanks :grin:

 Scarfield: lol involuntary bot testing xD
 nesnes112: struct it should displays for x=2
 nesnes112: 2 stars in line 1
 nesnes112: and 2 stars in line 2
 struct: its doing that
 struct: that code is doing the exact same that the python one is doign
 struct: doing*
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you ought to try it out in #fr :P
 Scarfield: automaton speaks french :scream:
 nesnes112: struct I tested it on scrimbait only displayed 2 stars on a single line for x=2

 megamagg2: powers?
 megamagg2: ah no 2&#160;:(
 nesnes112: ok thank you struct for ur help
 nesnes112: hi
 nesnes112: how to make the spaces are displayed before the stars (ie for example n=5, I want there to be the display of 4 spaces followed by a star for line 1)here is my code
 nesnes112: for (let i=1;i&lt;=x; i++)
 struct: isnt that what that code is doing?
 struct: or do you want to display 2 spaces 1 star and 2 spaces for first line?
 nesnes112: for n=5 exampleI want in the 1st line 4 spaces followed by a star then in the 2nd line 3 spaces followed by 2 stars etc...
 struct: that code you pasted is doing exactly that

 ycsvenom: hello
 ycsvenom: guys can anyone explain how he has encoded his code here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/0r5IMh1.png">https://i.imgur.com/0r5IMh1.png</a>
 ycsvenom: i know it's a utf16 but i don't know how to make it in that behavior(Chinese characters)
 ycsvenom: and i have decoded it successfully but i want to generate my own
 Lugassi: if I remember correctly there is an online site for that
 ycsvenom: what it's name?
 ycsvenom: i tried to search but didn't find anything
 Uljahn: print(b"print('hello')".decode('utf-16-le'))
 Lugassi: If I still remember its like code encoding rewrite online or some like that!
 Lugassi: But The Code Ulijahn works to...
 ycsvenom: thanks
 ycsvenom: worked successfully
 Lugassi: no prob
 Laki_42: Is it allowed to use pythongolfer, I used it before but I didn;t know is it allowed or not&#160;?
 Wontonimo: it isn't an auto win
 5DN1L: nobody says it's disallowed so far
 Wontonimo: you still have to golf your code before using it to get the full advantage
 Wontonimo: it won't strip comments or replace variables with shorter versions for example
 Wontonimo: and sometimes it will contain a non-valid character and just wont even be accepted by CG
 Blokops: my rule of thumb if that im against a ruby user then the golfer is free games else is cheating
 jacek: everything is allowed until it isnt
 Blokops: everything is fair in love and ruby clashs
 Quidome: is this golf thing used a lot in clash?
 Blokops: shortest code mode
 Quidome: Yes i undertand but is it used?
 Quidome: Also code Golf...
 Quidome: hm... that explains&#160;:)
 Laki_42: I think it is not used much, because a lot of people doesn't know about it or don't like to use it
 Quidome: I simply could not understand the smallest contributions in code golf 
 Quidome: Maybe the have used this trick
 Blokops: also belows 50 char the Pgolfer is useless
 Quidome: I mean i could not figure out how they get it so small&#160;:)
 Laki_42: I don't get it how in some code golfs are C in the top of leaderboard, is it some trick with it
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I published the JS and ruby versions, not sure if anyone uses them
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh, and the C trick too
 Laki_42: what is C trick&#160;?

 Laki_42: Wow, I didn't know you can use scanf and printf without "stdio.h"
 Quidome: What about the codingame reverse engineering optim. Any small tip is more then welcome
 5DN1L: search the forum :wink:
 Quidome: aha ok, look into that
 5DN1L: the optim's a famous game
 Quidome: it's weird&#160;:)
 5DN1L: heehee
 Blokops: there a tips section
 Quidome: but also intriguing
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: better do the sentence tokenizer puzzle before it gets deleted
 Blokops: is going to get deleted?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I think once it hits 20 votes it gets deleted if the score is below around 3.2
 5DN1L: Hmmm, the renamed bot games have revised urls now. no trace of the old names
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Wontonimo: :listless-sad-cat:
 5DN1L: except the quest map (don't tell CG) :zipper_mouth:

 BadBurger: hmm, marslandercalc distance to vSpeed to 0.this does not correclty calculate, we are going to assume that current power = 4
 BadBurger: var S = (vSpeed.toDouble().pow(2.0)) / (2*(4-3.711))
 BadBurger: what have i missed?
 tealfrog: how do you feel about compressing code in python with u16?
 Wontonimo: hey BadBurger, do you have a replay to share?
 Wontonimo: that calculation looks right
 Wontonimo: tealfrog, i have no opinion.  do as you please 
 jacek: i feel satisfaction
 BadBurger: X=2500m, Y=2533m, HSpeed=0m/s VSpeed=-14m/sFuel=516l, Angle=0°, Power=4 (4.0m/s2)
 BadBurger: S=389
 tealfrog:&#160;: )
 BadBurger: this is stats when its vspeed 0
 BadBurger: Landing in progress...X=2500m, Y=2182m, HSpeed=0m/s VSpeed=0m/sFuel=320l, Angle=0°, Power=4 (4.0m/s2)
 tealfrog: usually i wait until last moment to see if i need it
 Wontonimo: ok, what's the problem BadBurger.  Also, where's the replay link?
 BadBurger: idk how replay helps. im doing locally. but here is a check with online engine
 BadBurger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/606758942">https://www.codingame.com/replay/606758942</a>
 BadBurger: y-S is not same as y when vSpeed = 0
 Quidome: Nice hovering&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: what is your target Y?
 Wontonimo: Calculate S using S=v^2/2a like you did.  if S &gt; Y- target Y then no need to thrust.  Else, thrust max
 Wontonimo: so, the question is, what is your target Y&#160;?
 BadBurger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/556ef1f9-9258-488a-a2f0-77f81f92e660">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/556ef1f9-9258-488a-a2f0-77f81f92e660</a>
 Lambert_W_Function: i swear ive had like 7 shortest modes in a row
 BadBurger: is this just because it gives int and im calc float, so i loose some decimals it off a little
 Wontonimo: here is a replay using only S=v^2/2a
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/606764592">https://www.codingame.com/replay/606764592</a>
 BadBurger: yeah but if S=v^2/2a and your target is landing_y then its not showing correctly because then vSpeed should be 0 when its on same y as landing pad
 BadBurger: no?
 I.T.: I will prostitute mtself for money
 5DN1L: kicked
 jacek: oh my
 Andriamanitra: best ban that guy tbh
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: all that work just to say that again
 Andriamanitra: he just said some racist stuff in a clash too
 I.T.: xdfcftcf
 I.T.: cfc
 I.T.: f
 5DN1L: ok ban then
 5DN1L: is it the same guy?
 Andriamanitra: yeah
 5DN1L: i mean i banned one just the beginning of this hour
 5DN1L: almost spamming the same way
 Wontonimo: hey BadBurger, not quite so, because the lander can't actually increase it's thrust to 4 all at once.  The signal is to thrust 4, but it actually only increases by 1 per turn
 Wontonimo: so you need a bit more logic, but the math is sound
 Ben-D-Anderson: 5DN1L, that I.T. guy dropped some awful slurs in a clash of code I was in with him
 BadBurger: solved it.
 5DN1L: hmmm that's bad, Ben-D-Anderson
 Ben-D-Anderson: yeah
 5DN1L: let's hope similar guys don't come again (though it's likely they do)
 Ben-D-Anderson: mhm
 5DN1L: some people just like wasting their time
 5DN1L: why not do some coding?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it is the same guys over and over
 Ben-D-Anderson: exactly, I spend my fridays solving algorithm problems cos im just that cool
 5DN1L: :sunglasses:
 Lambert_W_Function: gaming
 5DN1L: Lambert_W_Function get the 8th shortest mode in a row!

 Lambert_W_Function: fr though if u look at my history (idk if u can), u can see the past 10 or so have been shortest modes
 5DN1L: i can't
 5DN1L: but i believe you
 5DN1L: i've had shortest mode for a few days in a row if i remember correctly
 Lambert_W_Function: usually i get a good mix, but like 95% of today's have been shortest lmao
 5DN1L: at least it's not 100% :D
 Lambert_W_Function: yeah lol
 Ninjadinogal: yo dumb question but how do I move on from my league? I'm currently number 1 in wood 1 and idk why it won't give me access to bronze rules and such?
 5DN1L: Your games are still running
 5DN1L: Wait until they're all finished
 5DN1L: If by then your score beats the boss's score, then you're promoted
 5DN1L: You can see the progress of your games by clicking LAST BATTLES
 Ninjadinogal: ah ok gotcha, thanks. Was just resetting it too frequently :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L:&#160;:)

 Wontonimo: it looks like you'll have to do something
 ninjadip: wha'ts poppin everyone
 Blokops: birds mostly
 ninjadip: poppin not pooping
 ninjadip: i always wonder what makes one bird spot a cooler bird hangout than other places. 
 Blokops: maybe is lile highschool
 Blokops: some bird are emo, other weebs, etc
 ninjadip: hmm
 Blokops: fun fact pigons dont rest in trees
 Blokops: ever
 ninjadip: i don't have any pigeons
 ninjadip: but that is interesting
 ninjadip: we have one place in our city that has a lot of electrical transformers at that inersection and there is an audible, very audible, artificial owl noise on a constant loop
 ninjadip: i wonder if it's for the electrical stuff or the billboards right above it, to keep s*** off their billboard space
 Josdel: hello
 Josdel: hello
 ninjadip: hi there
 Wontonimo: hiya
 Wontonimo: oh, ninjadip Blokops and Josdel all online at the same time :wave:
 Josdel: How are Wantonimo?
 Josdel: :thinking:
 Josdel: Won*
 Wontonimo: pretty good
 Wontonimo: what have you been working on Josdel&#160;?
 Wontonimo: your rank is 14012.  Have you thought of worrking on that by playing a multi?
 Wontonimo: can't get much higher with just clash
 ninjadip: whats up Wontonimo
 ninjadip: playin some don't panic 2 here
 ninjadip: making elevators for my little lemmings now
 Wontonimo: nice.  i did some clean up on "CG's Next Top Model" to get it ready for approval
 Wontonimo: re-read marchetes write up on alphastar.  That is quite setup he spells out for training NN
 ninjadip: training NN?
 ninjadip: just had a duh moment, I had my guys making elevators when they where none, but they kept wanting to make them, then i realized I never added these elvators to the vector for them to stop PANICing and making elevators lol
 npc1640: anyway i can retrace the code of my clash&#160;?
 Wontonimo: do you have a copy?
 Wontonimo: if no&#160;: then no;if yes&#160;: then yes;
 ninjadip: I love easy fixes
 npc1640: when the clash over , i forgot to save other's grat code&#160;;(
 npc1640: great
 Wontonimo: move on with life.  heck, move onto multis instead of clash
 Josdel: Wontonimo, for the moment I haven't been doing many exercises here (they make me think for a long time until I find the answer ;_;), sometimes I'm doing the katas or playing with my friends clash
 Wontonimo: play Tron (aka line racing) or mad pod racing

 Husoski: npct1640 look in your notifications to find the notice of your finish, click on that and you can get back to the results page and see submissions.
 Josdel: hmmm
 Josdel: :thinking:
 Husoski: npc1640 look in your notifications to find the notice of your finish, click on that and you can get back to the results page and see submissions.
 Josdel: I will try
 Wontonimo: hm?  what are you thinking Josdel?  oh, my last comment was for npc1640
 Wontonimo: but yeah, give it a try also Josdel&#160;!
 Wontonimo: another multi to try is connect 4
 Wontonimo: you can make a starter bot to just play randomly
 Wontonimo: and then add to it
 npc1640: that helps&#160;! but i cleared that notification i need , so stupid i am .
 npc1640: thank you husoski
 npc1640: suddenly i found that notificatio hasn't been deleted&#160;!  much thanks:yum:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: hmmm, I can get the right answer by sticking in a couple reverses, but wouldn't swear it is right
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: that 3D printer puzzle...
 Wontonimo: i'm not sure how it is difficult
 Wontonimo: is it that it is too large?  Can't you just use each side as a cut and remove
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it is the usual, getting the thing turned around the same way the author envisions
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: like blockout but much easier
 Wontonimo: wouldn't numpy make quick work of this?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Beats me.  Haven't used python much
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: The python guys seem to be able to do just about anything in 10 lines
 Wontonimo: time to jump on that wagon Gloriasticles
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I can do all the simple stuff.  Too much manual reading to figure out what all those libraries are doing
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I never could figure out how that guy solved 5D chests using import scipy.ndimage
 Wontonimo: i think it is messed up
 Wontonimo: everything passes other than chair
 Wontonimo: ah, i had the coordinates backwards
 Wontonimo: done, approved
 Wontonimo: if you want to see my solution Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker I posted it
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: ah, nice
 Wontonimo: did you have a solution ready?
 Wontonimo: that was a little fast :smirk:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yeah, I published it
 Wontonimo: neat
 Wontonimo: i'm outta here!  bed time

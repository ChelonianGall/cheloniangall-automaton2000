 jrke: What to do in X egg problem hard puzzle
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/x-egg-problem">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/x-egg-problem</a>
 <b>**eulerscheZahl approved this puzzle</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: in the initial suggestion you always had 3 eggs
 Gorbit99: there's a great video about this on youtube bt
 Gorbit99: w
 JackBashford: codingame while English class very p0g
 Putnam3145: why is it that i'm not very good at shortest clashes, anyway
 Putnam3145: apparently i've only won two of them
 Putnam3145: hmm
 Putnam3145: ...and then win another one right as i complain
 Putnam3145: the correct lesson to be learned is never complain
 jacek: or always complain
 jacek: to get the results
 Putnam3145: oh, man, the next challenge is reach top 1000?
 Putnam3145: oh, i'm already 1,146th
 Gorbit99: shortest is one of those things you get better at over time
 Gorbit99: it also depends a lot on your preferred language
 Allis: Ruby is practically cheating when it comes to golf. :innocent:
 Putnam3145: agreed
 Gorbit99: "cheating"
 Putnam3145: optimal, yes
 eulerscheZahl: everyone has the possibility to use ruby, so it's not cheating
 Gorbit99: takes a freaking ton of time to learn all the tricks 
 eulerscheZahl: and 15min are enough to google a thing or two
 jrke: i agree euler its not cheating its also a skill
 Putnam3145: yeah, the time limit is nice
 Gorbit99: so has great "code golf tips for &lt;language X&gt;" threads 
 jrke: yeah sometimeom googls i learn new things fre while clashing
 Gorbit99: you can usually run through them in a matter of 2 minutes if you need
 Gorbit99: the best thing I learned here sofar was `dd` in ruby
 eulerscheZahl: what does that do?
 Gorbit99: it reads all of stdin
 Allis: Like `cat` would do, but one character fewer.
 Allis: The `dd` trick is nice, but $&lt;.map{...} comes in handy more often.
 Gorbit99: it doesn't split, for that $&gt;.to_a or $&gt;.map is better, but it can be put right next to a puts
 jrke: oh euler you have solved X egg problem i many langs
 Gorbit99: it's useful when you have a situation like puts gets...
 Gorbit99: you can usually just do puts`dd`
 jrke: for shorter mode use p for print int 
 jrke: like a=1
 jrke: p a
 jrke: it will print 1
 Allis: Booleans as well.
 jrke: yeah
 Allis: And sometimes the output is like Array#inspect; that's always nice.
 Gorbit99: it's always that
 Gorbit99: p is by definition puts x.inspect
 Allis: What I meant is that sometimes the output contains the square brackets.
 Gorbit99: yeah, but that's usually more of a problem when golfing, besides of course debugging
 Allis: We were talking about golfing...
 Gorbit99: I know, that's what I'm saying
 Gorbit99: it's rare that having [] there is good
 Allis: Not for Ruby, of course.
 jrke: python is good for fast as well as easy as well as short
 Allis: No, it's not. :P
 Gorbit99: if you can do one liners, it is great
 Gorbit99: but the secret to fastest is knowing what your language can offer in terms of stdlib
 Gorbit99: that's why C sucks for it
 jrke: one liner is easily possible ruby and python
 Allis: Much easier in one than the other, I think.
 jrke: C++ you can do one liner but a long line
 Gorbit99: I'd say it depends on the problem
 Allis: It's crazy that Python core has map() but not reduce().
 Putnam3145: NO TIME RAN OUT DURING AN ERROR ATTEMPT NO
 Putnam3145: AGH
 Putnam3145: always pay attention to the timer kids
 Putnam3145: i had a 75% working one with a strange bug, then I tried fixing it
 Putnam3145: big mistake
 eulerscheZahl: python has indentation for blocks while most languages have { }that makes python a terrible language for 1-liners
 Gorbit99: Allis, you mean like ruby inject?
 Allis: Well, most people spell it "reduce", but yeah, same thing.
 jrke: my shortest main func in c++ for bot programming
 jrke: int main(){while(1){cout&lt;&lt;drive_minimax(input())&lt;&lt;endl;}}
 Allis: Python's lambdas are also limited to having only a single expression as the body.
 Allis: And no ternary operator.
 Gorbit99: codesignal has the code golf type, where they don't count whitespace
 Allis: I've only ever seen Python win golf when its string slicing syntax gets to shine.
 Gorbit99: there python is quite good
 Allis: Does codesignal support the Whitespace programming language?
 Gorbit99: not yet I don't think
 Gorbit99: btw, I learned ruby entirely on here, code golf and all
 Gorbit99: it's possible
 Allis: I'm always on the hunt for an opportunity to use Whitespace in anger. :sweat_smile:
 Putnam3145: i literally only barely know to begin wtih this reverse and someone has it done in the first second using ruby
 Putnam3145: hmmmmmm
 Putnam3145: that's not a ruby problem that's, uh
 Putnam3145: just sus
 Allis: Nah, #each_slice definitely played a role here.
 Allis: Apologies for any spoilers there.
 Putnam3145: i mean there's kinda the feeling that this is a seen-before thing
 Gorbit99: each_slice is the function I always forget
 Gorbit99: allis has played like 2.5k clashes
 Gorbit99: if you have issues with him probably knowing most of them, contribute
 Putnam3145: no yeah that's fair
 Putnam3145: it's only an issue so far as it's an inherent problem with the system, unless there's such a quantity that nobody can
 Putnam3145: anyway figured it out so that's nice
 Allis: @Putnam3145 If it's any consolation, I generally do quite well on ones I haven't seen before, but your misgivings are sound.
 Allis: I'll stop once I get first, I promise. :P
 Allis: Only joking; I suspect I probably won't actually get there. Every win is worth .01 now, it  seems.
 Putnam3145: oh yeah and in case you want to know what D's range stuff isl ike
 Putnam3145: my solution there uses it pretty hard
 Gorbit99: @Allis even with 8 people?
 Putnam3145: really I practically only use D anymore when I see range stuff, cause it's got a lot of reaaal nice range stuff
 Gorbit99: my scenario right now is 0.04 per win, -0.5 per 2nd
 Allis: @Gorbit99 Indeed, but I think it might be that the "Trueskill" value of clashes right now isn't especially high.
 Allis: Winning against stronger opponents is worth more, if I understand correctly.
 Gorbit99: yep
 Gorbit99: and winning against more also
 FinnWerner: hello from germany
 Gorbit99: hallo
 jacek: :scream:
 Gorbit99: in coc, basically the pain starts at 15th to 10th place
 Allis: That sounds about right. I've got a handful of 8/8s from occasions when I forgot I was waiting for a clash to start that're probably biting me pretty hard now.
 Gorbit99: for me it's those god awful clashes, that shouldn't even be clashes, where the bot just wins by default
 Allis: Hate those with a passion.
 Gorbit99: at least they are not perfect
 Allis: The one with the 10-character Bash solution can't be beaten, I think.
 Gorbit99: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e4688e0-aa56-4a35-9a5e-7f082e0e6148">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e4688e0-aa56-4a35-9a5e-7f082e0e6148</a>
 Gorbit99: god damnit
 Gorbit99: ah, right, that one
 Allis: Hm? What's unwinnable about that one?
 Gorbit99: I remember when around a year or 2 ago I was in a clash with valnykol with that and he was complaining about it
 Gorbit99: well, had no damn clue what it's about
 Gorbit99: the bots both did 0%
 Allis: It can certainly help to have internalized the A..Z-&gt;1..26 mapping.
 Allis: I compulsively add up the letters of words even AFK, and that comes in handy here. :P
 Gorbit99: but 123 doesn't fit into that
 Allis: Well, no, but it just skips the middleman.
 Gorbit99: and the 104 testcase also had numbers mixed in
 Allis: It's the "value" of characters multiplied by some coefficient based on what type of character it is.
 Gorbit99: ...
 Allis: Where for numbers it's just identity and letters it's based on alphabetical position.
 Gorbit99: imo that's just stupid
 Allis: I agree that the creator of the puzzle probably shouldn't have made it eligible for reverse mode.
 Gorbit99: let's be real, it's probably one of those cheeky reverse only ones
 Gorbit99: reverse is by far my least liked type
 Allis: Yeah, it's not great.
 Allis: Wouldn't be sad to see it replaced by performance.
 Gorbit99: or just thrown right out the window
 Gorbit99: other issue with it, is that for normal users, it's hard, but once you solve it once...
 Allis: There are glaring flaws in the system, but they're only really exploitable by addicts. The fix would be to ban addiction, but that's a big ask.
 Allis: Or have ten thousand distinct puzzles, I guess, but that's an even taller order.
 Gorbit99: I have 743 clashes behind me, you have 2253
 Gorbit99: we both are addicts
 Allis: For sure.
 jrke: what would i call it if i just use maximiser in minimax?
 Gorbit99: gotta love how I don't need to search for it, because it's one screen
 Gorbit99: depth first search
 Gorbit99: or breadth first
 Gorbit99: depends
 Putnam3145: i had perfectly working code in python, switched to D cause I thought I could improve the character count (required whitespace is sometimes worse than being able to one-line with a bunch of {} and&#160;;) and
 Putnam3145: not in time
 jrke: BFS is another thing
 Putnam3145: ... what do you mean&#160;;
 Putnam3145: oh
 Putnam3145:&#160;;)
 Putnam3145:&#160;; )
 Putnam3145: wowee
 Gorbit99: that's why you save your code before you start doing other things with it in shortest
 Gorbit99: I usually keep the original line and write below it to see if my idea is shorter (if it works)
 Gorbit99: @jrke might be just greedy algo, if you only evaluate one step
 jrke: not one step few steps but all for me not for opp
 Tiramon: wow was the 'don't send me validate/refuse notifications' option broken?
 Tiramon: or i activated them accidently ...
 eulerscheZahl: works like a charm
 Putnam3145: ruby really is
 Putnam3145: really, really good for code golf
 Allis: Objectively the best, I think.
 cjzw: guys check out my contribution and comment please. 
 Allis: All the Perl craziness when you need it combined with a plethora of useful utility methods.
 eulerscheZahl: seems that all you have to do is split at the @ and write it in 2 lines. I miss the challenge here

 Putnam3145: ouch
 Putnam3145: oh DANG
 Putnam3145: i'm ranked exactly 1000
 Allis: I'm ranked exactly 1. ^_^
 Allis: I think I'm done.
 Allis: Well, I better not speak too soon. I'm actually worried someone's gonna out-golf me on my one pending clash, so my stomach is in knots. :sweat_smile:
 Allis: Congrats on breaking top 1000! Don't forget to claim your XP.
 Allis: Do you have a long-term ranking goal, or are you just kinda seeing how far you can take it?
 Allis: I saw your D range code by the way; very slick.
 Putnam3145: i don't really have a ranking goal, no
 Putnam3145: ugh
 Putnam3145: remind me never to use -- again
 Allis: Mutable state is the root of all confusion.
 Gorbit99: ruby is the best golfing language... on this site
 Gorbit99: that's because it handles strings and bignums effortlessly
 Gorbit99: real golflangs are really really weird
 JackBashford: yes
 JackBashford: we need assembly
 JackBashford: on this site
 JackBashford: x86 or arm idx
 JackBashford: idc
 eulerscheZahl: you can embed asm in C/C++
 Tiramon: hm cg missed that i solved mars lander optimization with 100%

 eulerscheZahl: at some point they recomputed optim puzzles scores
 eulerscheZahl: do you still have 100%?
 Galaxy_001: yes
 Tiramon: ah best is 100% but current is only 61%
 Tiramon: and the 100% are outdated
 Galaxy_001: All test cases are correct with my solution.
 Galaxy_001: Not 100%&#160;??
 Tiramon: oh my last 100% solution was a not GA solution and after that it seams that i experimented with a GA one without submiting

 yonder83: the resistance is very weird puzzle
 yonder83: in first three test cases you must find longest words which cannot  be on top of each other
 yonder83: and last test case is completely different, so what is point of this puzzle. I don't understand
 yonder83: really strange and ambiguous

 aftokratoras: I am currently in level-4
 cjzw: guys check out my contribution, comment and vote!!!!!!!
 eulerscheZahl: these puzzles don't tell you to solve them in a certain way. You get a problem statement and it's up to you how to tackle it
 Putnam3145: a *lot* of these are DS/algo questions
 Putnam3145: just presented in a more "practical" way

 JBM: with you?
 JBM: isn't that supposed to be solo?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe he means "against"at least I hope so
 JBM: when *is* the round anyway
 JBM: haven't cf'd in a long tim

 JBM: me neither
 JBM: but it beats what i'm doing now
 eulerscheZahl: streaming puzzle solving on CG?
 JBM: i parsed that as if cg hosted streams and got very confused
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 i need the daily report, what's going on
 Automaton2000: but it is really hard to debug
 AntiSquid: Masterpiece sure if you look like your avatar (which i highly doubt)
 jacek: AutomatonNN do you use MLP
 AutomatonNN: why do you need them to read the puzzle?
 jacek: AutomatonNN what about friendship
 AutomatonNN: when i have a good idea that you are the only one who talked about the contest and not the replay
 jacek: Automaton2000 whats was that frog's name, again?
 Automaton2000: this is the only thing that would be cool if you could have won
 AggYzz: You are given a polynomial represented as a list of floats A,B,C,... of length M, where A,B,C... are coefficients used in the following way p(x) = A + BX + CX^2 + DX^3.... You must find the derivative with respect to X.
 AggYzz: bruh
 AggYzz: omegabruh
 jacek: derivative of polynomials is easy
 Zenoscave: I finished the quests!
 Kariin: *clapclap*
 Scarfield: even the CoC ones :o
 jacek: *clop clop*
 eulerscheZahl: oh, zeno's puzzle got approved.
 jacek: hm/
 CanhToanLe: hi guys :DD
 Scarfield: hi
 DomiKo: hii
 jacek: moshi moshi
 xzxy: pepe
 eulerscheZahl: are these balloons on your profile pic from ICPC?
 Scarfield: DomiKo, curious; Does your GA for Mars Lander figure out the land vertically, or do you enforce it to do so?
 Scarfield: the = to
 Zenoscave: Scarfield yes, even the CoC ones
 DomiKo: enforce
 EgorCry: Would you recommend any books for get junior knowledge in python? I need progress very soon (((
 DomiKo: in my eval if angle&#160;!= 0 then i say that  it isn't safe landing
 Scarfield: but you still rely on the "search" to find the angle to be 0 (with the eval) and not overwriting the last genes before impact
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: maybe with that
 Scarfield: okay, thought so to, but i think i figured out what my problem is
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: i didn't think of that
 Scarfield: xD genetic engineered algo
 DomiKo: XD
 DomiKo: i guess that could really help
 DomiKo: maybe i will get some extra points with this
 DomiKo: yap
 DomiKo: now i have 338 in 1 test case
 Scarfield: nice, wasnt my intention, but happy to help, even without knowing it xD
 DomiKo: the best score on forum is 341 
 DomiKo: so really thanks :D
 Scarfield: haha np :D
 DomiKo: hmm i have some problem with vertical speed&#160;:(
 PhillipMartinez: So I'm new here and have little experience. But I want to better my skills any advice&gt;?
 DomiKo: do puzzles
 PhillipMartinez: Dope
 DomiKo: a lot of them
 PhillipMartinez: Thanks, 
 Astrobytes: Assuming you're familiar with the basics of at least one language 
 Astrobytes: Basics being variables, loops, conditions etc
 PhillipMartinez: Yup. just looking to refine the skills, whatever I run into and don't know is just another thing to learn. 
 Astrobytes: Great attitude&#160;:)
 PhillipMartinez: Always :smile:
 Scarfield: AstroBetty
 Astrobytes: From now on I will call you Betty
 DomiKo: Scarfield without if for angle&#160;!= 0
 DomiKo: i have to corrent path by hand
 DomiKo: but result is better
 Scarfield: nice :muscle:
 DomiKo: error is like 0.1 of vertical speed
 DomiKo: so it's really easy to correct
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/nU1VfYYKMDk?t=29">https://youtu.be/nU1VfYYKMDk?t=29</a>

 Scarfield: not available in my country&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Black Betty by Leadbelly
 Scarfield: yea can see the title, just not play the video
 Scarfield: lol found another video available, interesting version xD
 Astrobytes: was late 1930s, rendition of an old work/prison song. Quality stuff.
 DomiKo: top20 ;D
 Astrobytes: gg DomiKo
 Astrobytes: *gj
 Scarfield: oh had no idea, just remembered it from Need for Speed Underground 2 soundtrack
 Scarfield: sweet, you were 25 before iirc?
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remembered that too, just thought I'd give a history lesson
 DomiKo: yes
 Scarfield: nice
 Scarfield: and sure, then i have learned something today :p
 Astrobytes: Learnfield
 DomiKo: 333 -&gt; 338360 -&gt; 365505 - 509
 DomiKo: more i can get
 DomiKo: so thank you&#160;;)
 Scarfield: you welcome, i will ask another question that gives you the remaining points soon :p
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 DomiKo: i love your question
 DomiKo: they are so accurate
 eulerscheZahl: need for speed underground 2, loved that game
 eulerscheZahl: and Brooke Burke told us to drive carefully in real life
 eulerscheZahl: well, i never cared about the styling part of the game. upgraded whatever helped for the game, no matter how it looked like
 Scarfield: oh yea, had steering wheel and pedals for it as well&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: keyboard for me
 Astrobytes: same
 Scarfield: i still remember one drag race, where she said "Don't switch gears first", as if staying in 1st gear the longest would win the race 
 eulerscheZahl: and i had that epic downhill drift
 eulerscheZahl: and finished it by ramming into the wall
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: loved the mustang, one of the few rear wheel drive cars in the game i think, and drifted like crazy
 DomiKo: top 15 coming
 DomiKo: ohh man
 DomiKo: that tip is so powerful
 DomiKo: from 2453  to 2475
 jacek: its not othello is it
 DomiKo: mars lander&#160;;)
 jacek: bot updated. now im ready when m smits will start working on breakthrough
 PAINANDSUFFERING: UwU
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Yes, yes, lots of pain
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Yum yum
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Hehehe
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Anyone here read "We Are Legion" and 'For We Are Many" by Dennis Taylor?
 offeck: I didnt, are these books worth a read?
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Yea, they're really good
 Zenoscave: what tip was marslander?
 Zenoscave: need to get rid of my old mars lander hardcode soon
 DomiKo: DomiKo, curious; Does your GA for Mars Lander figure out the land vertically, or do you enforce it to do so?
 Zenoscave: Oh I remember seeing that one
 Zenoscave: thx
 DomiKo: but you still rely on the "search" to find the angle to be 0 (with the eval) and not overwriting the last genes before impact
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: i seen this to
 DomiKo: but never used it before
 Zenoscave: No GA for the optim yet
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave, nice puzzle man. Way outside my comfort zone, took me about a day of reading lol
 jacek: in other words, 1 star
 Astrobytes: *day of researching, not reading the statement 
 Zenoscave: Glad you liked!
 Zenoscave: What lang did you solve in?
 GAUSS_: ı am at beginner level in development. And ı wanna learn python. Any Advice? 
 Zenoscave: do the beginner puzles. ask for help here when stuck on a particular one and never ask for advice until all your own research doesn't work. but always ask for advice right after&#160;;)
 R3Ked: why do i have compiler error CS0165
 R3Ked: and would it be ok to post my code in chat
 GAUSS_: thx to advice. ı will research&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: It is suggested to only post small portions of code that aren't full solutions. but error messages are always welcome in pastes
 R3Ked: well i just started writing my code
 R3Ked: so i think it's ok
 Zenoscave: But as for puzzles it is different. most people in chat have already solved the puzzles so it is also fine
 R3Ked: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5f10d82b-92df-4683-a9fd-d2e76700d8f9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5f10d82b-92df-4683-a9fd-d2e76700d8f9</a>
 Zenoscave: Just try  not to post full code solutinos for multiplayer or optim games usually
 R3Ked: it's error code CS0165
 Zenoscave: what does that error mean?
 R3Ked: it says that there's an unassigned variable
 R3Ked: and it points to the output log
 Zenoscave: does it give what line the problem is on?
 R3Ked: yes
 R3Ked: the line that reads "Console.WriteLine(moveTo);
 R3Ked: forgot end quote whoops
 Zenoscave: well is moveTo always have a value?
 Zenoscave: what happens if Tx &lt;= lightX?
 R3Ked: oh that fixed it
 R3Ked: i just gave it a null value at the start
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 rangelucas: _Flippy man tell me how you saved those 2 chars haha
 rangelucas: pretty please
 woaisthisgit: yeah i really need to know too 
 woaisthisgit: i found a way to get 57 but 56? wow
 Zenoscave: what lang was the solution in? and what problem?
 woaisthisgit: we all had python
 Zenoscave: what was the problem? CoC?
 Zenoscave: which one?
 woaisthisgit: yes
 woaisthisgit: err.. i dont know how to find out lol
 Zenoscave: just describe it
 Dlx: #whenYouRealizeYourClashWas99%LongerThanNeeded;p
 woaisthisgit: if you repeat the list L, find the Pth element. Input: line 1, length of L and P space seperated. Line 2, the elements of list L space seperated.
 woaisthisgit: Test case input: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec0b3013-a018-4684-bbc8-9a5b4971ee61">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec0b3013-a018-4684-bbc8-9a5b4971ee61</a>
 Zenoscave: how long was the soln? 55?
 woaisthisgit: 56
 woaisthisgit: you have a working 55?
 woaisthisgit: please share :D
 Zenoscave: one sec. I'm solving it now
 rangelucas: i did 58 as woaisthisgit
 woaisthisgit: thanks&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: _,P=input().split();print((input()*99).split()[int(P))
 Zenoscave: how long is that
 Zenoscave: 55
 woaisthisgit: 54 but i think the syntax is a bit messed up
 Zenoscave: yeah missing a ]
 R3Ked: ok wow
 woaisthisgit: ah it doesnt work tho
 R3Ked: i suck at this so much i had to read the pseudo code
 woaisthisgit: when you multiply input theres a space missing
 Zenoscave: doesn't work though
 Zenoscave: yeah just saw that
 Zenoscave: _,P=input().split();print((input().split()*99)[int(P)])
 Zenoscave: That should work
 woaisthisgit: it almost works but
 woaisthisgit: you need the nth element
 woaisthisgit: so its one off
 Zenoscave: Oh and it's off by one becase the index of the first is 0
 woaisthisgit: working 57 if you subtract 1
 woaisthisgit: hmmm
 Zenoscave: _,P=input().split();print((input().split()*9)[int(P)-1])
 Zenoscave: I bet the test cases aren't enough that 9 was too small or repeats
 woaisthisgit: guess it must be; i honestly cant think of anything else
 woaisthisgit: thanks for your help&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: np
 Zenoscave: also wanna see a shorter awful one
 woaisthisgit: yeah sur
 woaisthisgit: sure
 rangelucas: nice one
 rangelucas: you cant guarantee what the test cases will be if you havent played it before, right?
 rangelucas: I mean, there are more test cases than the ones you usually get to use
 rangelucas: right?
 woaisthisgit: yeah
 woaisthisgit: but usually they're very similar
 rangelucas: I see
 Zenoscave: f,s=$&lt;.map &amp;:split;$&gt;&lt;&lt;s[(f[1].to_i%f[0].to_i)-1]
 Zenoscave: ruby 49 chars
 Zenoscave: works for any input, no tricks
 rangelucas: ruby so much better for code golf
 woaisthisgit: ^
 rangelucas: will I invest my time on learning it, tho? not sure haha
 ZloyLosyash: hey guys, what does it means
 Dlx: no idea
 Dlx: sounds like a bug
 Zenoscave: You have a newline when you shouldn't or vice versa
 Dlx: or are you creating your own challenge?
 Zenoscave: also I have a 41 char solution in C to that CoC&#160;;) won't give it out though
 ZloyLosyash: nope, i'm solving puzzle. I've passed all tests and can't pass this one
 R3Ked: yippee, more compiler errors!

 ZloyLosyash: ok, endl did the trick. thanks
 Zenoscave: np
 Zenoscave: yw
 R3Ked: it says this:
 R3Ked: CS1525: Invalid expression term '}'
 Zenoscave: youre missing a semicolon or some other character before the '}'
 R3Ked: i have my semicolons all lined up
 R3Ked: i don't see what i'm missing
 Zenoscave: then a paren?
 Zenoscave: not sure without seeing the line and surrounding parts

 Zenoscave: line after else has } not {
 Zenoscave: mistyped
 R3Ked: bruh
 Zenoscave: lol
 R3Ked: think i just saw it as curly brackets not opening and closing curly brackets
 Zenoscave: been there
 R3Ked: i'm checking out the bot programming
 R3Ked: and people just keep crashing their pods
 R3Ked: why
 R3Ked: i'm going up against a bunch of syntax errors
 tomatoes: but they re indestructible 🤨
 tomatoes: pods
 R3Ked: i'm going up against people who have freed their code of semicolons
 R3Ked: "semicolon more like semiNOlon"
 R3Ked: oh there's someone who doesn't syntax error
 R3Ked: i clicked view full leaderboard, how do i go back to the previous view?
 R3Ked: oh nvm

 Putnam3145: i am so close
 Putnam3145: i can feel it
 Putnam3145: 3 clashes in a row
 Putnam3145: i've done it!!
 Putnam3145: due to a lucky series of shortest code, which, it turns out, ruby is, in fact, "overpowered" in
 Putnam3145: orrr no i didn't
 Putnam3145: darn
 Esquivelh: xD
 Putnam3145: okay, NOW i have done it
 LinhT.Nguyen: damn xD

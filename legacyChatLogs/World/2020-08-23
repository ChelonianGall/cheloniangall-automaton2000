 kevmok: how to debug?
 Zuabros: debug what
 kevmok: like a console when typing code
 procamania: i guess were looking for the step through function or watch option like a regular IDE
 JohnPotter895: hello
 JohnPotter895: hello
 SANA: Guys i'm just starting bot programming. I haven't knew it before. How can i start it? Any suggestions
 Zuabros: yes
 Zuabros: Do the harry potter one
 Zuabros: its pretty straigthforward
 Zuabros: fantastic bits
 Zuabros: then coders strike back, its nice to start too.
 Zuabros: all you need to know is how calculate distance from two cardinal points (which you basically will need to know to every bot)
 Zuabros: use some sort of greedy algorithim (go to nearest point) and you have a nice start
 SANA: Cool. Thanks for the suggestion. I really appreciate that.
 GoogleJeff: pankdm: share your code please!
 GoogleJeff: pankdm: I want to see how you beat me by 11 characters
 GoogleJeff: oh, very clever
 GoogleJeff: nice job!
 jacek: good morning
 SpotlessCoder: Hi I'm streaming clash of code on twitch @ twitch.tv/spotlesscoder - Grinding for winning 10 clashes in a streak
 dbdr: happy caturmorrow jacek
 anantaCodes: Hello, Are the questions of Clash of Code available as a collection anywhere&#160;?
 Allis: @anantaCodes Do you solemnly swear that you're up to no good?
 anantaCodes: @Allis What do you mean? I solved a problem which I could not in a clash and now I want to see if the test cases that were given in the problem.
 DiL: @anantaCodes I may be wrong, but I don't think there's a list; you can submit a feedback if you think there's an issue with a clash
 anantaCodes: @DiL There is no issue with the clash. As I said, I wanted to verify my solution against test cases. I think there is no way to go back to a particular clash question then?
 DiL: once the clash is done I don't think you can test your solution... clashes repeats if you keep playing enough
 Allis: @anantaCodes Still around?

 MSmits: looking for unicode characters to draw dots and boxes map
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: think i got the dot and left line
 MSmits: but top line is hard to find
 MSmits: ⠁ ⎸
 MSmits: these I have
 Sherkhan: что делать
 MSmits: I'm gonna solve 2x2 map before I go out of wood 1 :P
 jacek: trying to book it?
 MSmits: ▔
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: I mean writing mcts solver, then run it on turn 1 and win
 MSmits: it's very doable
 MSmits: in wood 2 i mean sry
 MSmits: 2x2
 MSmits: ▏▔▏▔▏▔▏▔
 MSmits: meh
 jacek: maybe use ncurses
 MSmits: whats that
 jacek: lib for console text gui
 MSmits: I want it to work well in the IDE where I'll be testing mostly
 MSmits: btw as for books, dots and boxes 7x7 is like uttt in that regard. It only works if someone else is booking also, otherwise too much branching
 jacek: 196 moves 1st ply
 MSmits: or when they use a *very* determnistic for of minimax. But randoming on equal score should mostly solve that
 MSmits: mmh isn't it 112?
 jacek: 112 rounds
 MSmits: in fact 14, if you account for symmetry
 jacek: ah well maybe
 jacek: yes, counted squares * 4
 jacek: i have squares. adding 1 edge affects 2 squares
 MSmits: yes 49 squares, 112 lines
 MSmits: 7*8 + 7*8 = 112
 jacek: hmm gonna make move generation more smart
 MSmits: good idea, plenty of heuristics to try
 MSmits: dont generate every move
 MSmits: are you using minimax or mcts?
 jacek: for now trying minimax. but for now i have simple heurstic
 MSmits: ah, I feel this game should be mcts 
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: but with real rollout
 MSmits: not EPT
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: heavy, real rollout
 MSmits: no need to play till 112
 MSmits: you can do chain analysis, last 40 plies or so
 MSmits: maybe sooner
 MSmits: games should solve halfway I think
 dbdr: are you starting D&amp;B MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah, slowly though, I want to try to solve 2x2 with a mcts solver before I try the bigger board
 dbdr: cool
 MSmits: from 2x2 to 7x7 I will need a simulation function and many move generation heuristics, so that will be slow as well. 
 dbdr: I think it's a fun problem
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: did anyone share a way to print maps easily?
 MSmits: having trouble coming up with a scheme

 dbdr: beautiful&#160;:)
 MSmits: mmh dont think they monospace properly
 dbdr: CG console is bad for that
 dbdr: need to modify the CSS
 MSmits: sucks&#160;:(
 dbdr: it can be done, but yeah...
 Memo12334: uh so this bot programming challenge gives a something in units. What can I do with that
 Memo12334: "a radius of 400 units"
 MSmits: ignore it
 MSmits: it's 400
 MSmits: doesnt matter what the unit is
 MSmits: thats why it says units
 MSmits: it's just a radius of 400
 Memo12334: will see what I can do with the opponentxy

 dbdr: ^ wins the beauty contest&#160;;)
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Illedan: What is that?
 MSmits: dots and boxes map
 Illedan: For? :P
 MSmits: dots and boxes
 Illedan: Alright&#160;:+1:
 Illedan: oh
 MSmits: just like to be able to print a map for debugging
 Illedan: there is a puzzle called it
 MSmits: it's a multi
 dbdr: multi
 dbdr: seems not losing as p2 helped you jacek&#160;:)
 OliB150: If i wanted to 'give up' on a certain game/challenge and try another one in the meantime, will my existing code be saved online at all, or should I take a copy?
 MSmits: whenever you click play it's saved
 MSmits: whenever you click submit in  a multi arena it's also saved in the history tab
 MSmits: so you can check older versions thee
 MSmits: there
 OliB150: ah ok, ye i saw the history one for submit and was worried that was the only way it got saved, but i can only do 5/7 test cases atm!&#160;:'(
 MSmits: which game is that OliB150?
 OliB150: "Target Firing"
 MSmits: ah dont remember that, or maybe I didnt do it at all
 OliB150: "only" a medium dificulty, but I can't get those final two as I need to change how I'm storing data so I can work with it a bit easier!
 MSmits: ah yes, well then you know what to do 
 MSmits: mediums can be quite hard btw, the puzzle creator decides the difficulty and they aren't always right about that
 OliB150: Well, I know I need to change it, but I can't work out what it needs to change to yet, hah
 OliB150: it's only a few days old but only has a 30% completion rate, so at least I'm the same boat as a lot of others!
 OliB150: Tbh, I only checked the description before choosing it, considering I only signed up yesterday, maybe it was a bit too much too soon (although it's by no means by first day programming!)
 jacek: someone actually reads descriptions before trying? o.O
 OliB150: It was the first one that came up, so it wasn't a rigourous selection process, lmao
 Illedan: Wow, 100 games in wood 2 of Dots and Boxes. :zzz:
 dbdr: how come?
 Illedan: No idea why I have to do 100 games to promote :P 
 Illedan: But it is a waste of resources :D
 dbdr: maybe it's a change for all commus now?
 dbdr: would be good generally
 Illedan: For the top league yeah
 Illedan: Wood 1 :rocket:
 dbdr: gz
 Illedan: :bow:
 dbdr: hold on to your sanity now&#160;;)
 dbdr: you promoted very quick if you just looked at it 20 minutes ago
 Illedan: 3 ifs...
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Fixed size board in Wood 1?
 dbdr: yes, 7x7
 dbdr: Illedan: writes three ifs and promotes in 15 minutesMSmits: write a MCTS solver for wood 2
 dbdr: 2 players, 2 styles&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah&#160;!
 MSmits: though obviously I am doing it to practice my algorithm in a smaller setting :P
 MSmits: this is what wood leagues are for&#160;:)

 MSmits: just using the same bitboard
 MSmits: so that I can easily port it to 7x7
 jacek: bitboard eh?
 MSmits: sure, why not
 MSmits: it's 112 bit for a full gamestate
 dbdr: with MSmits bitboard is why not, it's of course!
 MSmits: of course!
 dbdr: you don't store the score in your state?
 MSmits: why use scored states
 MSmits: from every gamestate, the history doesnt matter
 MSmits: only the future
 jacek: you said 112 bit for a full gamestate
 MSmits: it's like oware 
 jacek: thats a kue
 jacek: lie
 MSmits: i can store transpositions without the score
 dbdr: the bitboard is a lie
 MSmits: so in that sense it's not a lie
 MSmits: if you read papers, they always use unscored states when trying to solve
 jacek: i only read rocks
 MSmits: you mean like... tablets?
 jacek: and they store scores there
 MSmits: stone ones?
 MSmits: on rocks?
 MSmits: :confused:
 dbdr: D&amp;B looks like a game that could have existed for millenia
 MSmits: agreed
 jacek: like oware?
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: it's cool that you can play it with smaller grids too. 5x5 isn't even solved afaik
 MSmits: 5x4 is
 dbdr: 5x5 is solved
 dbdr: took 8 years&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah then I read an older paper
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 MSmits: where did you read that?
 jacek: he solved it
 MSmits: mmh don't think dbdr is obsessive enough for that
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/forum/topic2.jsp?forum=110&amp;topic=148">https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/forum/topic2.jsp?forum=110&amp;topic=148</a>
 dbdr: MSmits, misunderestimated me&#160;;)
 MSmits: I did?
 dbdr: &gt; don't think dbdr is obsessive enough for that
 MSmits: you would let a program run for 8 years&#160;?
 dbdr: I haven't done it, so I can't be sure
 jacek: i bet MSmits would
 MSmits: yeah I would
 dbdr: it's true I'd rather obsesses for a few weeks than years, but it might happen
 Illedan: WTF, who makes the Indexes of Y go the opposite way of normal
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: Illedan yeah that was annoying
 MSmits: but it's like that in Onitama also
 dbdr: N - Y
 dbdr: problem solved
 Illedan: pff
 Illedan: Ok, was only 2 places to fix
 Illedan: Phew
 Illedan: Gogo top 10
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: also, it's debatable what is "normal". math has Y growing upwards for centuries at least
 Illedan: Yeah, but every game. ever. has it downwards :P
 jacek: maybe in australia
 MSmits: and it makes sense, that's the direction trees go also
 jacek: your game trees go upwards?
 MSmits: i meant the biological ones, but sure, it's probably better to draw game trees upward, because then the root is down :P
 MSmits: like with trees!
 MSmits: again... biological ones
 dbdr: like this MSmits?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thedailymass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tree_upsidedown.jpg">https://thedailymass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tree_upsidedown.jpg</a>

 dbdr: gogogo #1 jacek
 jacek: nah im gonna need to rewrite my game engine
 MSmits: so your winscore = 10k - empty boxes left?
 jacek: 10k - ply level, or -10k + ply level
 MSmits: so that it prefers states with more finished boxes or something?
 MSmits: ohh ok
 jacek: so shortest wins are better
 MSmits: right, that makes sense in general
 MSmits: but dont think it matters here does it?
 dbdr: not if you wan to humiliate your opponent
 MSmits: or do is a chain move a single ply for your bot?
 jacek: each move is different level in my bot
 MSmits: like 5 moves in a row, counts as 1 round?
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: you can do it either way i suppose
 jacek: well shortest wins are better in most games
 dbdr: well it's annoying that you can play several times in a row
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: in breakthrough i could play with opponent for 20 plies seeing forced win
 dbdr: or you can have multimoves. it's a tradeoff
 MSmits: jacek yeah those are funny
 MSmits: dbdr multimoves only works with good heuristics
 MSmits: because in some cases, multimoves will lead to a node having thousands of children
 dbdr: it's just a different representation. it's equivalent
 MSmits: so you need to force some order in there
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: but your tree is much less deep
 MSmits: true
 dbdr: so it's still equivalent
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but practically, multimoves is harder to implement
 dbdr: (a^b)^c = a^(b*c)
 MSmits: right
 Illedan: Damn, the gap from 7th to 6th. I guess this is where the real game starts :D 
 dbdr: yeah, with very fw ppl in wood 2
 dbdr: I think this game misses another boss
 Illedan: Yeah
 dbdr: which can be added later. it's fine for now
 Illedan: Should be a copy of  jacek - 2 points
 jacek: i think im the last who uses some search
 jacek: rest is some heuristic or random
 dbdr: leojean890 uses heuristic I think
 MSmits: mmh is there any time with the 2x2 where it's not the best choice to take a box when it is available?
 MSmits: I don't think so, but not 100%
 dbdr: don't make me think about 2x2&#160;;)
 MSmits: too complex?
 dbdr: less than 7x7, but distracting
 MSmits: allright&#160;:)
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/483245585">https://www.codingame.com/replay/483245585</a>
 MSmits: nice chain
 dbdr: I think I've only seen field3 doing those
 MSmits: might be some weird heuristic
 dbdr: this game is definitely weird&#160;:)
 MSmits: ^
 pardouin: ooch, it hurts
 pardouin: I used to play this game alot in high school ^^
 dbdr: why does that hurt?
 pardouin: to get "Fanny"
 dbdr: ah&#160;:)
 dbdr: gotta pay field3 a drink
 pardouin: I just passed 2x2, didn't try 7x7 yet
 pardouin: I focused more on CotR and CvZ to get CPs fast (for the quest map)
 Monsieur_Pook: on coders strike back what's the point of shield if you can't calculate the distance to the enemy ship?
 pardouin: I'm pretty sure you CAN calculate it
 pardouin: but anyway you can get gold without using shield at all
 Monsieur_Pook: oh I thought i should use them since they were introduced anyways
 Putnam3145: wow, literally all of the validators work locally but 50% fail when submitted
 Putnam3145: that's kind of annoying
 AndrewJ: bad test cases can be annoying
 pardouin: what puzzle is that?
 Putnam3145: labyrinth
 pardouin: your algorithm is too slow?
 Putnam3145: might be
 Putnam3145: kinda doubt it though
 AndrewJ: my internet is so slow and it took like 1 minute for my code to freaking test and submit
 AndrewJ: -_-
 TheSpiffiest: So when a program times out - are those timeouts adjusted for languages?
 DomiKo: nope
 MSmits: no, that would be a bad idea
 DomiKo: everybody is equal :wink:
 TheSpiffiest: Ha.  Well Rust is 12 faster than python in my simple tests and I have everything working at home, but times out on the server...
 TheSpiffiest: So time to translate 
 MSmits: you can't give languages a bonus to put them on equal footing
 MSmits: there is no fixed relation between them
 MSmits: sometimes c++ is 100x faster than python
 MSmits: sometimes 3x
 TheSpiffiest: I can see that
 MSmits: if you were to try to correct for this, people would have to try all languages to see which one was most overcorrected
 Putnam3145: the timeouts tend to be more for algorithmic issues than anything else
 MSmits: now they can just choose the language that is most suitable for the job at hand, which is what CG promote
 MSmits: it's madness to give python players 10 seconds per turn on UTTT just to put them on equal terms with C++ with 100 ms. Think of the server load&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: True. And it's a bit like code golf. You should learn list comprehension runs faster than similar for loops
 TheSpiffiest: semi-unrelated, but <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.pythontutor.com/">http://www.pythontutor.com/</a> helps a bunch in  seeing what python actually wanted to do
 MSmits: nice!
 MSmits: I'll remember that for when I am teaching it
 pardouin: you can prototype in python and then translate in C++
 TheSpiffiest: So for reference - what is the timeout so I can practice at home?
 MSmits: you can, but you will have to do some work to optinize in C++ also
 TheSpiffiest: is there a standard?
 MSmits: usually it says in the multiplayer arena
 MSmits: for puzzles I think 6 s? 
 MSmits: check the description
 TheSpiffiest: ...2 seconds on this one.  You guys thought of everything.&#160;:)
 MSmits: well not me, but some of them did :P
 Putnam3145: it wasn't too slow
 Putnam3145: it's just that my algorithm ONLY COINCIDENTALLY found the fastest for each of the test cases
 Putnam3145: and it failed to on half of the server test cases
 TheSpiffiest: interesting. What problem was that for?
 Putnam3145: labyrinth
 pardouin: fix your heuristic&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: I had a little similar for checkers. As I develop bots the stuff I haven't completed just returns random.  Depending on the run it would go from 15th to 50th
 pardouin: maybe you thought too much about the testcases for your heuristic without imagining other situations
 TheSpiffiest: usually lower
 Putnam3145: nah, the problem was that I somehow didn't notice that my algorithm wasn't actually checking the entire map
 Putnam3145: or rather, checking until it finds a path that's short enough
 glenngielty: Horse-racing duals
 field3: I'm a little happy. Thank you dbdr.:relaxed:
 Memo12334: hate it when my pod keeps moving around a checkpoint for eternity
 dbdr: from the big win field3?&#160;:)
 EcksDee: reduce your speed in some cases, and/or adjust your target position relative to your velocity
 Memo12334: hm allright
 field3: It is a side effect of the strategy of surrounding from around to avoid "2block stop algo".:slight_smile:
 Izzobacul: @Nakinamo share your code please

 cheshao:&#160;?&gt;
 cheshao:&#160;???
 Schwase: yoo
 Fosfen: Hey&#160;! I am struggling simulating the mars lander problem
 Fosfen: If the gravity force is 3.711m/s², why is the lander falling 2m ins the first second instead of 4m&#160;?
 Fosfen: (rounded values)
 EcksDee: s = s0 + v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t
 EcksDee: you need to multiply the acceleration by 0.5
 Putnam3145: it's kinda intuitive too
 Putnam3145: it's going at 3.711 m/s at the end of that second
 Putnam3145: and it was going faster linearly that whole time
 Putnam3145: and it started at 0
 Putnam3145: so,
 Putnam3145: you take the average of the start and end velocity in that second to get the total distance traveled
 Fosfen: Ohhh ok I think my understanding was too naive for this, gotta hit high school again I guess
 Putnam3145: and you find that (0+3.711)/2 is in fact something like 1.85
 Putnam3145: i never learned this in high school but then i never got into calculus in high school
 EcksDee: mars lander is the only (i think) puzzle that does not simply just add the acceleration to the vel
 Fosfen: Thank you&#160;!
 EcksDee: oh i forgot something.. s = s0 + v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2but since t = 1, its still the same&#160;:)
 Zuabros: Fosfen, you are misunderstaing acceleration for speed
 Zuabros: acceleration is the speed in wich speed increases, not speed itself
 Fosfen: Yes I tried the naive approach of adding the force directly to the speed which is not how gravity works at all
 Putnam3145: not how acceleration works
 Putnam3145: they're not the same units
 EcksDee: its the way it works in the other physics puzzles though. Acceleration vector added to velocity vector, velocity vector added to position vector. as far as i remember mars lander is the only one where its actually correct, and not just summed discretely together, so a natural mistake to make on this site&#160;:)
 Putnam3145: my simulations in mars lander work assuming the discrete summing, though?
 Fosfen: Yeah I guess it also works but the values are slightly different
 EcksDee: if you are multiplying by 0.5 its not disctrete. the 0.5 comes from the integral
 Putnam3145: I'm taking the current velocity vector, adding the gravity and force vectors to it and using that as the simulated value, and I'm using it to simulate where I'm going to land and how fast, and doing it in such a way that if I'm off at all I'll crash,
 Putnam3145: don't panic in less than 200 characters is brutal
 codest: nice
 MSmits: Putnam3145 agreed it is
 jacek: but you made it?
 MSmits: I did, dont know if Putnam3145 did
 EcksDee: he is a brutal proffessor
 EcksDee: so much so i had to use 2 f's
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gfycat.com/pl/amplemisguidedchanticleer">https://gfycat.com/pl/amplemisguidedchanticleer</a>
 EcksDee: xD
 MSmits: good teaching&#160;:)
 jacek: that's msmits first lesson as teacher
 MSmits: i wish&#160;:)
 EcksDee: hoogleraar or professor in dutch?
 codest: java best
 codest: it is very useful
 jacek: kree java!
 MSmits: hoogleraar / professor is almost the same I think
 codest: and python the best
 EcksDee: high teacher seems to be the cool'er name&#160;:)
 MSmits: mmh high in English has some added meanings though 
 MSmits: Hoog doesn't mean you just took some weed, for example
 EcksDee: haha wasnt how i meant it either
 MSmits: hehe ok
 EcksDee: high king for instance, is a king ruling over other kings
 MSmits: while smoking tons of weed
 EcksDee: xD of course
 Putnam3145: i need to go to bed
 Putnam3145: tomorrow i will try it in, like, ocaml or closure or something, who knows, even ruby has had no luck for me
 Putnam3145: clojure.
 jacek: D
 MSmits: Putnam3145 I did it in python
 MSmits: helps if you do a bunch of golf clashes and watch how other players do it
 Putnam3145: i got my 4-wins-in-a-row or whatever it is by a bunch of code golf clashes in a row
 Putnam3145: cause those are easier for me to win, usually
 MSmits: ah I havent done that yet
 MSmits: btw, that particular golf is not just about smart golf tricks, you also need to make the logic as simple as possible
 Putnam3145: yeah, i can tell
 MSmits: you dont need most of the input 
 jacek: why does d&amp;b has the illusion of black dots :v
 MSmits: and the exit can follow the same logic as every elevator
 Putnam3145: this i also could tell, but i'm not sure what less input i could use
 Putnam3145: yeah, i'm just storing all the PoIs on every floor, then checking if they're before the first one or after the last one, depending on direction
 MSmits: Pols?
 Putnam3145: points of interest
 MSmits: ah
 Putnam3145: exits + elevators
 Putnam3145: everything else is ignored
 MSmits: I do it differently, I know that they change direction every time they are stopped
 MSmits: so i have a sign thingy that flips
 MSmits: and they always go to the right first
 MSmits: that way you already know the direction your guys are going at any time
 Putnam3145: ah, so you don't have to compare to "RIGHT" or "LEFT", you just see if it's different from last tick
 MSmits: yeah something like that
 Putnam3145: although i'm not comparing to RIGHT or LEFT
 MSmits: this might not be the best way btw, but it was compared to what i had before that
 Putnam3145: i'm comparing the first char to R or L, obvs
 Putnam3145: where that's shorter
 MSmits: yeah someone else told me they did that
 Putnam3145: bafflingly my python golf is actually worse than my D golf
 Putnam3145: MAYBE BECAUSE I'M USING SPACES INSTEAD OF TABS
 Putnam3145: WOW
 MSmits: spaces are better
 Putnam3145: i personally use spaces
 Putnam3145: but for golf, where you're losing by the character?
 Putnam3145: no way
 MSmits: also, you should try to put everything on one line if it is indented
 pythonFan-arch: hello pragrammer :D how you going 
 MSmits: whats a pragrammer?
 pythonFan-arch: a person who code 
 pythonFan-arch: :P 
 Putnam3145: okay my python score is... still kinda bad because i'm at 85%, whoops
 MSmits: woops
 pythonFan-arch: guys who to baypass ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

 MSmits: dont divide by zero :P
 Aravindhsiva: Anyone can join
 MSmits: I wonder if I've solved 2x2 D&amp;B. My algo stopped after 10 ms and 18981 rollouts
 MSmits: seems reasonable
 MSmits: dont output any moves yet so...
 dbdr: MSmits: time to publish a paper&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: after 10000000ns, we finally have the answer!
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: what is the solved score for 2x2 again?&gt;
 MSmits: says +2 for 2nd player from my algo
 jacek: quite a chain eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483302468">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483302468</a>
 MSmits: dbdr lost the full board to a chain earlier
 MSmits: 49 boxes :P
 MSmits: ahh seems like my bot says 3-1 from optimal play, same as theory
 MSmits: I dont trust this though, I fixed far too few bugs
 jacek: you dont trust theory?
 MSmits: i dont trust my bot :P
 dbdr: what's your source for the 3-1?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/1728/optimal-play-for-2-by-2-dots-and-boxes">https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/1728/optimal-play-for-2-by-2-dots-and-boxes</a>
 MSmits: I vaguely remember reading about the +2 result earlier
 jacek: oh and they use the same format to print the board as you
 MSmits: I just noticed that, thats not where I got it from though
 MSmits: I got it from some gith link
 MSmits: someone made a D&amp;B player I think
 jacek: drum&amp;bass player
 MSmits: time to output some moves. This is particularly annoying. I always store game states on games like this so I have to compare the game state of the winning child with the result of a move, at the end
 MSmits: which is painful because of chains and such
 dbdr: you don't know which move corresponds to which child?
 MSmits: not during search no
 MSmits: I just generate the new states
 MSmits: without giving them moves
 MSmits: giving them moves is a bit silly when you can get to the same state by different routes (transpositions)
 dbdr: but you need the moves when you generate the children
 MSmits: yeah, but I dont store them
 dbdr: you don't need to store them
 MSmits: during selection, i dont apply moves
 MSmits: I just get the new boardstate from the node
 dbdr: you need them at some point to generate the child
 MSmits: yes
 dbdr: you could use that again
 MSmits: yeah I can regenerate the states using almost the same code. 
 dbdr: the nth child is the parent modified by the nth move
 MSmits: thats what i usually do
 MSmits: mmh not exactly 
 MSmits: because of chains
 MSmits: I could have 10 children and each of them have the same move
 dbdr: so if the nth child is the winner, you do the nth move
 MSmits: because it's taking a box
 MSmits: I use multi-move
 dbdr: I don't understand, how can the same move lead to different children?
 MSmits: because of chains
 MSmits: the child can be multiple moves away
 MSmits: the next layer in my tree is always a player switch
 dbdr: if you use multimoves, then it's a single mutlmove away&#160;;)
 dbdr: right, so from a multimove you need to pick a single monomove
 dbdr: but that's a smaller problem
 MSmits: yeah, but it's some work to determine that. But you're right, i dont have to actually compare the states, i can regenerate the states in the same order
 dbdr: I guess it's similar work
 MSmits: for oware it's much simpler. I just take the root state and the best child and see which pit is empty
 MSmits: which *extra* pit is empty that is
 dbdr: I mean it's not hard to find the edges that were added, then pick one of those that's currently legal
 MSmits: hmm, thats neat
 MSmits: though
 MSmits: no, nvm, that doesnt work
 MSmits: you need to pick the right edge
 MSmits: so that you take boxes
 dbdr: "pick one of those that's currently legal"
 MSmits: you can take a box and then a random edge
 MSmits: or just take that random edge
 MSmits: both are legal
 dbdr: indeed, i meant to say one that create a box
 MSmits: ah ok
 dbdr: which is also trivial
 dbdr: sorry, I said it wrong earlier
 MSmits: right, no, i got it
 MSmits: this sort of thing also always annoys me in minimax
 MSmits: the top layer needs a slightly different approach because you need the move
 MSmits: so basically, I dont mind the search, I am just too lazy to give the answer :P
 dbdr: 42
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: ".. and everything" so yea
 dbdr: it's the same principle
 dbdr: very long computation, at the end what you get is the knowledge that the computation is finished, and a meaningless answer
 reCurse: Just store the PV at every level, easy
 CamelCase_joke: hey guys, is regex used often in code golf?
 MSmits: hey reCurse!
 MSmits: anything you're working on on CG?
 jacek: :tada: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483306781">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483306781</a>
 reCurse: A little bit
 MSmits: ... runner?
 reCurse: No
 jacek: u...t?
 eulerscheZahl: your own game where you are getting around the SDK?
 reCurse: lol I forgot about that one, oops
 reCurse: I have too many competing interests
 dbdr: jacek, did you break your bot?
 jacek: somewhat
 AliZainAldeen: bayern vs psg what do you say&#160;?
 wartonbega: psg cauz france is better XD
 Zm4j: psg cauz they are underdogs
 jacek: bayern because lewandowski
 Illedan: EricSMSO&#160;?
 Illedan: Very annoying to not see the final score in the end of DB -.-
 jacek: hm?
 Illedan: Winners score is replaced by WIN..
 Illedan: I would like to see the actual score value :P 
 jacek: you can count the boxes yourself
 Illedan: -.-
 jacek: am i wrong?
 Illedan: No.
 codest: it is hard work
 EricSMSO: Hello you all. I agree it would be better to display the winner's score at the end. I could change this quite easily, but is it allowed to change something once it is approved by other contibutors&#160;?
 JBM: changing the viewer only is morally correct
 JBM: for technicalities of what does or doesn't mess up the rest, i think illedan is better placed to answer
 MSmits: EricSMSO i think it's fine to change it, but you have to ask one of the others if it won't break anything. I don't think so
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: what does following someone in clash of code do
 MSmits: it's like following them on twitter, only without the racism
 Illedan: Fine to change yes
 EricSMSO: Once you have won or lost, why worry about how much&#160;?
 Illedan: I'm often looking through some replays, skipping to the end. If I lose by a lot =&gt; look at it
 Illedan: else move on
 MSmits: i like it because you can MSG the end score and see if it is the same as the final score
 MSmits: if you want to test your solver and such
 EricSMSO: Ok I will try to do something. I have not be concerned so far because I have not developped a true bot. But don't shout on me if it disturbs the actual leaderoard.
 Illedan: Thx :D
 EricSMSO: Ouch so many typewritting errors!
 MSmits: it's ok, I studied it for a minute and understood :P
 MSmits: sigh... these bugs. I tried to subtract an integer from a uint8_t
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/483332254">https://www.codingame.com/replay/483332254</a>
 Illedan: :rocket:
 MSmits: gj&#160;:)
 Illedan: Linq FTW xD
 MSmits: I am still trying to solve wood-2, almost there, but have some hard to find bug :P
 Illedan: Even won him on submit :D
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 dbdr: &gt; MSmits: sigh... these bugs. I tried to subtract an integer from a uint8_twhy do you waste time on things like this?
 dbdr: the compiler can tell you this
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/483333261">https://www.codingame.com/replay/483333261</a>Wow, this was close :o
 Illedan: Bieffect of my stupid ifs xD
 MSmits: dbdr how do you make the cg compiler tell you this?
 dbdr: cg compiler?
 MSmits: the one in the IDE
 dbdr: if you use c++ you probably need to set options
 MSmits: I dont compile locally
 MSmits: generally
 dbdr: wat?
 MSmits: I mean, I just code it, then copy paste into IDE
 dbdr: mind=bown :D
 MSmits: brown?
 dbdr: blown&#160;:)
 MSmits: well :poop: for brains is an expression :P
 MSmits: nice typo&#160;:)
 dbdr: nice Illedan
 Illedan: More ifs ftw.
 MSmits: btw, my bot is working and i can promote any time i think. But my solver is bugged somehow, reporting wrong scores
 MSmits: probably has to do with unscored states, bit complicated to work with
 dbdr: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: yay it works!
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483334715">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483334715</a>
 MSmits: my bot as 2nd player predicts it will lose at the start
 MSmits: then boss starts to make mistakes
 EricSMSO: Have you noticed the final display?
 MSmits: yes, good job EricSMSO
 Illedan: :tada:
 MSmits: btw, game as player 2 is solved in 3 ms 
 Illedan: Thx
 MSmits: player 1 8 ms, player 2 3 ms
 MSmits: guess that 1 move makes a big difference
 Illedan: Yeah, I suspected the game is too easy :P
 MSmits: I was worried my bot would give up as player 2
 MSmits: I mean, if it know it has lost before it started... why try?
 Illedan: For Wood 2, try anyway :D 
 MSmits: hehe yeah, lemme submit and end this
 dbdr: MSmits, anthropomorphizing your bot :D
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483335222">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483335222</a>
 MSmits: unfair
 Memo12334: maths is so important in AI ;p ,  I should had taken it serious back in high school ...
 Illedan: dbdr, fixed games vs me?&#160;:(
 dbdr: yes
 EricSMSO: My wood 2 boss plays almost random. So it just a not so hard challenge for newcomers
 Illedan: Dammit
 MSmits: Memo12334 there's many different kinds of math and levels of math, depending on what you're coding you might need some
 Memo12334: basic trigonometry
 MSmits: most math here doesn't require heavy calculus though
 MSmits: most multis not even that
 Memo12334: oh weird
 dbdr: Illedan did you tune against me?
 MSmits: many are gridbased
 Illedan: Tune?
 Illedan: I have only IFs.
 MSmits: so it's often manhattan distance
 dbdr: tune your ifs
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Fixing 1 of them now
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: this is nuts
 MSmits: my submit is failing even though my bot makes no mistake
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: it gives away boxes because it solves as p2
 dbdr: too clever
 MSmits: because it sees in the future that if it doest give away the box, the opponent will take it anyway
 dbdr: MCTS for wood 2 backfires
 MSmits: i was mostly unlucky with too many p2 starts vs boss
 MSmits: it's catching up now
 dbdr: greedy depth1 promotes, IIRC
 MSmits: not gonna make it i think though
 MSmits: I'll spam submit :P
 dbdr: MSmits got beat by random boss
 dbdr: :popcorn:
 MSmits: is it random?
 MSmits: lol yeah it failed
 dbdr: I guess so, but not 100%
 Illedan: haha
 MSmits: I predicted it though
 Illedan: Fixed 2 bugs
 Illedan: Lets see
 dbdr: it's definitely bad. everyone promoted except you&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol it's awesome, it solved the game :P
 MSmits: it's like that YT you shared 
 MSmits: with 2 robots playing chess
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: if you win as P1, you just need a lucky submit I think
 MSmits: yeah
 Illedan: Cap it to some low depth?
 MSmits: mmh I might still have a bug also
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483336516">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483336516</a>
 Illedan: Bad link
 MSmits: solves as 1-3, then 3-1, then 2-2, should be impossible
 Illedan: Oh
 Illedan: those works now
 dbdr: why not?
 dbdr: solved is assuming perfect opponent
 dbdr: which this one is not
 MSmits: i know, but if i solve as 3-1, it should never be able to catch up to me
 MSmits: so the predicted score can never go down for me
 dbdr: ah yes
 dbdr: the boss is better than perfect then&#160;;)
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 dbdr: Illedan :rage:
 Illedan: Nananana
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: precious points for Illedan
 dbdr: you are P1 every single time
 Illedan: Helps to pay the creator :dance:
 Illedan: Daym, helps to be P1 in this yeah
 dbdr: indeed&#160;:)
 Illedan: Guess it is solved for P1 very easy
 dbdr: very easy?
 Illedan: Yeah
 dbdr: it took 8 years for 5x5
 Illedan: You never need to consider every move
 dbdr: feel free to solve it and publish a paper
 dbdr: people thought about that too
 Illedan: $.$
 EricSMSO: Two liner boss, not as good as IForgot, but not so bad&#160;;-)
 Illedan: Ok, I guess :P 
 dbdr: at the end you don't need every move, but at the beginning, you need a lot
 Illedan: Hmm
 dbdr: a few symmetries and corner cases
 dbdr: still huge branching
 MSmits: Illedan the reason you need almost all moves is that they decide what the final chain-maze looks like
 MSmits: when you got the maze, or nearly so, you can easily solve
 Illedan: I guess the start of the game is more about the number of boxes with Edges of count 1, 2, 3 and 4.Then about how big the different chucks are.
 Illedan: And the number of chucks
 MSmits: It's about how many chains there are and their length and whether they are half open, cyclic or closed
 MSmits: there's different rules for different kinds of chains
 MSmits: sometimes multiple chains meet on 1 cell
 MSmits: it's more complicated than you'd think
 Illedan: Hmm, k. I'll accept that
 MSmits: btw, you can prune 4 moves
 MSmits: off the corners
 MSmits: "corner cases" like dbdr said
 dbdr: :innocent:
 MSmits: the two lines connected to the corner dots are completely equivalent
 MSmits: doesnt matter which you take first
 Illedan: haha
 MSmits: finally bugfree I think
 dbdr: famous last words&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's gonna crash hard in wood 1 i guess
 MSmits: no losses in 40 games and a bunch of draws all as P2. Won every P1 game
 MSmits: 1 loss now as P@
 MSmits: P2
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483342033">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483342033</a> but i dont think boss made a mistake
 MSmits: I gave away a box there, but  i think again a consequence of solving =/
 Illedan: Come to Wood 1 and try the real stuff :P 
 MSmits: i wonder how many UTTT games i lose because I solve 15 plies before the end
 dbdr: I only matters against weak players
 MSmits: after submit finishes Illedan&#160;:)
 dbdr: *it
 MSmits: another nice typo :P
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: :P
 MSmits: omg
 MSmits: still not promoted
 dbdr: :joy:
 MSmits: 20.79 out of 21.21
 Illedan: wtf
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: Want my 3 ifs?
 MSmits: i swear bot did not make a single mistake
 dbdr: I think the game is trying to tell you something MSmits
 MSmits: nah i am pulling him down
 Illedan: -.-
 MSmits: he's boosted :P
 Illedan: Wonder who did that..
 MSmits: hey, wasnt me, he was boosted before i started :P
 MSmits: this hemhel guy is not helping
 MSmits: I draw against him all the time as P2
 MSmits: which is a good result, but his rating is crap and it pulls me down
 MSmits: i pushed him a lot
 MSmits: ahh above boss now
 MSmits: so funny you can write a perfectly playing bot in wood-2 and not get promoted
 dbdr: it's like watching Federer struggling to win a match in an amateur tennis cup
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Yeah, because the enemies are doing unexpected stuff
 Illedan: Code for the enemy you are meeting, not dbdr :P
 darkhorse64: You forgot about "the best exit from the woods strategy", the kiss one&#160;?
 MSmits: heh, well the only reason i did this in the first place is to have these horrible bugs I have been having in wood 2 
 MSmits: instead of wood 1
 MSmits: kiss one?
 dbdr: darkhorse64, pretty dangerous in these COVID times&#160;;)
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: darkhorse64 i wanted to make sure my mcts solver works with unscored states and such
 darkhorse64: keep it stupidly simple
 dbdr: better than keep it Schutzstaffel
 MSmits: in the end promoted with +2
 dbdr: what Shenanigan now, Illedan?
 MSmits: it's kinda silly that it will do the whole submit with a broken bot when you promote
 Illedan: I made some bug, trying to find it
 Illedan: Fix 1 bug, make 2 new
 Illedan: Was better the earlier one
 dbdr: MSmits straight to #1?
 Illedan: *stright to #-1
 Illedan: Someone optimized for 2x2 board?
 Illedan: xD
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: It might be a week before I got a working wood 1 bot&#160;:)
 dbdr: shouldn't the same bot work at least somewhat?
 MSmits: many heuristics and such before you can even get a multi-move gamestate working
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: if there are multiple ways to capture boxes, you can get hundreds of children
 MSmits: I need to write heuristics to force an order and such
 dbdr: that's just optim, no?
 MSmits: mmh not if it crashes because it got stuck inside an expansion
 dbdr: timeout?
 MSmits: maybe i could make it work somewhat, not sure
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but currently it's also just selecting the lower 4 box corner of the map, so i need to adapt that too
 MSmits: but thats a job for the coming days, work tomorrow
 dbdr: yeah, will retire too
 MSmits: gn&#160;:)
 dbdr: gn
 Illedan: gn
 Illedan: I'll fix this bug, beat dbdr and sleep too

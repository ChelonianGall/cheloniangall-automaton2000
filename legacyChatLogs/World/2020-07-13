 TheMysteriousLampshade_b7c0: cout&lt;&lt;"Hello World!";
 jacek: congratulations, now youre expert on C++
 Astrobytes: Go forth and make games.
 dusty_sky: mmmm
 dusty_sky: why it is so easy?
 Astrobytes: jacek, not the best result eh
 TheMysteriousLampshade_b7c0: i go to hack NASA to see files with HTML hacking for NASA
 tomatoes: gl 
 Astrobytes: I see...
 Astrobytes: Off you go then.
 eulerscheZahl: hacking the NASA? did you mean NSA?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/932/">https://xkcd.com/932/</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: at least i rekt smits in oware
 Astrobytes: Ah nice placement!

Is there any option to change the language? :DD
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Settings-&gt;Language
 Astrobytes: Your profile-&gt;Settings-&gt;Language
 eulerscheZahl: or bottom of the start page
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/th4gml">https://prnt.sc/th4gml</a>
 Astrobytes: Or fix your French.
 eulerscheZahl: whatever is easier
 vasivarga: switching to english is fine&#160;:)) thanks
 eulerscheZahl: community puzzles only have an English statement btw
 vasivarga: I was in the learning section 
 eulerscheZahl: if it says "by XYZ", then odds are good that it's English only
 eulerscheZahl: for SDK contributions it's possible to have a bilingual statement. but most contributors me included don't care
 jacek: sacrebleu!
 eulerscheZahl: mon dieu
 Astrobytes: hon hon baguette
 Scarfield: sauerkraut
 Astrobytes: choucroute not sauerkraut!!!
 Scarfield: xD
 Schwase: ive been trying to figure out BFS for the maze/pathfinding application, but im still a bit stuck, ive created a class named "Node" with a List field and a Node field and created methods to construct a path using open and closed lists, but i dont think im really getting the actual object "Node" part of this, should the list be the Node's neighbors? also, how is iterator used? 
 Schwase: i understand the separate elements on their own, but im not really putting together how they all lead to a BFS pathfinder...
 eulerscheZahl: A node has the neighbors as a list of nodes
 eulerscheZahl: you start with a queue of nodes, initially only containing your target node
 eulerscheZahl: when, as long as there are nodes in this queue:dequeue a node n
 eulerscheZahl: for each neighbor of n, which you haven't visited before: visit it and put it in the queue
 Schwase: ok
 Schwase: that helps
 Schwase: ty
 eulerscheZahl: and save the path, how you reached that node. can be a class member "from" for instance
 Schwase: ok
 Astrobytes: Don't forget to break when you reach the target (if you have one)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, France has a public holiday tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: Bastille Day
 Astrobytes: yeah Bastille DAy
 Astrobytes: ah
 eulerscheZahl: that explains why i saw close to no staff online today
 eulerscheZahl: taking an extra day off
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they'll probably go on strike or a protest on Wednesday just to make it 3 in a row :P
 Astrobytes: It's the French way!
 jacek: so its time to break cg server
 Astrobytes: Someone upload an optim with loads of validators, where's Illedan when you need him 
 Schwase: in philadelphia they always have (had before covid) a bastille day celebration at the Eastern State Penitentiary
 Schwase: pretty fun
 Masterpiece: Hello
 Masterpiece: Is there anyone who would like to do contest with me in code forces&#160;?
 DomiKo: wow finally
 DomiKo: legend on hypersonic :D
 jacek: :tada:
 Astrobytes: good job
 DomiKo: now only 3:30H waiting....
 jacek: hows uttt going
 DomiKo: not good...
 DomiKo: right now iam stuck with my performence
 DomiKo: so today was a chill day
 DomiKo: and i did hypersonic
 DomiKo: but tommorow i will try again
 AggYzz: hello wolrd
 PexN: hello everyone

In Java, what is the most efficient way to remove an element from an array&#160;? .remove(int index) seems not to work
 JBM: Still not sure why the rest of the world calls it Bastille day
 JBM: Kind of a recent phenomenon, to the best of my observation
 JBM: Nobody calls the fourth of July Washington or capitol day, afaik
 Uly: I'm french, I'll explain it to you
 Uly: on July 14th, 1789
 Uly: french ppl took the arms against monarchy and took the political jail Bastille
 Uly: to get guns and gunpowder
 Uly: france made it the national day since
 Uly: Washington wasn't built in one day
 Uly: but Bastille was taken in one day

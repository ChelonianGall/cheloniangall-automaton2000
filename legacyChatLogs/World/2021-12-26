 kanteer: need help with the mad pod racing 2nd boss
 5DN1L: Yes? What type of help?
 kanteer: it's about the angles and stuff and i'm confused how to do if else statements 
 kanteer: i'm on typescript btw
 5DN1L: ok, what have you got now
 kanteer: i was thinking of just doing an if else statement similar to one in lua but that seemed to not work
 kanteer: i tried to translate the code but yea
 kanteer: so idk if it's something to do with console.log(); or not
 5DN1L: what is that console.log code you have now
 kanteer: console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' 100');
 5DN1L: Is the same code used to get past Wood 3 League?
 kanteer: console.log(nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90, nextCheckpointAngle &lt; -90, ' 0')
 kanteer: i forgot what league i'm in, but it's the second lesson
 5DN1L: ok
 5DN1L: your second console.log code seems wrong
 kanteer: that's what i'm trying to fix
 kanteer: because i think i have too many arguments 
 kanteer: well
 kanteer: for the nextCheckpointAngle
 5DN1L: You don't output the angle or the condition of the angle to console.log
 kanteer: i see
 kanteer: so what do i do?
 5DN1L: You're only allowed to output X, Y, thrust
 kanteer: i see
 kanteer: so how do i get it to calculate the angle?
 kanteer: does it have something to do with the const nextCheckpointAngle: number = parseInt(inputs[5]);?
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: it's given to you
 5DN1L: you don't have to calculate it yourself
 5DN1L: for now, at least
 kanteer: oh okay
 kanteer: i thought it was telling us to calculate the code
 kanteer: and make the AI work out where the next checkpoint is
 5DN1L: The puzzle statement tells you what inputs are provided to you
 5DN1L: and what outputs are expected from you
 kanteer: i see
 kanteer: but how do i get those outputs in my code?
 kanteer: im confused on how to set the code up to work like such
 5DN1L: Outputs include X, Y and thrust, ok? X and Y have been given to you. The only one you have to think about now is the thrust
 kanteer: ok
 5DN1L: and I think there is a hint somewhere in the puzzle statement, telling you how thrust is set would be optimal
 kanteer: so it give me the x and y output, but i now need to add the thrust onto that?
 kanteer: ok
 5DN1L: Can you find it?
 kanteer: do i have to make code or just edit it
 kanteer: i'm not 100% sure, i tihnk so, but just to be safe, where is it
 kanteer: because i think i have it i'm just not sure
 5DN1L: I can't see it now because I'm past that league :joy:
 kanteer: daw
 5DN1L: But it should say something about the angle being &gt;90 or &lt;-90
 kanteer: yes i see that
 kanteer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e02c168-07c0-4f61-8f9e-a14519fcb71b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e02c168-07c0-4f61-8f9e-a14519fcb71b</a>
 kanteer: this is what it says
 5DN1L: Yes, that's what I meant
 kanteer: yeah
 5DN1L: So you have to write that into the code, using TypeScript syntax
 kanteer: i see
 kanteer: so i use an if statement, correct?
 5DN1L: correct
 kanteer: ok
 kanteer: i'm not 100% sure how to write an if statement but let me write one rn
 5DN1L: Yes, take your time
 kanteer: ok i'm confused
 kanteer: i'm getting a lot of errors when writing the if statement 
 5DN1L: what type of errors?
 kanteer: it's just red underlines
 kanteer: if nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90 or nextCheckpointAngle &lt; -90
 kanteer: this is what i have rn
 5DN1L: oh, that's not how if statements are written in TypeScript
 5DN1L: the hint is just psuedo-code
 kanteer: oh
 kanteer: i see 
 kanteer: so let me figure this out rq
 5DN1L: ok, please do. convert the pseudo-code into TypeScript code
 kanteer: confused on how
 Astrobytes: RTFM&#160;;)
 5DN1L: What's RTFM?
 Astrobytes: read the f'ing manual 
 5DN1L: oh ok
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 5DN1L: just googled it lol
 kanteer: bro i'm not reading a manual lol
 jacek: or use python <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/rcoyqg4h8zo31.png">https://i.redd.it/rcoyqg4h8zo31.png</a>
 5DN1L: kanteer goggle TypeScript if else statement syntax
 kanteer: i'd rather use typescript since roblox-ts and godot-ts exists
 5DN1L: google*
 kanteer: ok
 Astrobytes: kanteer: CG is kinda for people who already have a basic  but firm grasp on programming, you can still learn on it but you're gonna have to look and follow some language tutorials

 kanteer: this look right or no?
 Astrobytes: 5DN1L: yep, that and the 'how to ask a question' page are really handy
 5DN1L: kanteer looks closer now, but still not quite yet
 kanteer: what am i missing
 5DN1L: you're required to console.log X, Y and thrust all in one line
 5DN1L: so you have to set thrust beforehand
 5DN1L: you don't console.log it beforehand
 kanteer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/efb1da73-5c87-4477-9865-297dd01c813f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/efb1da73-5c87-4477-9865-297dd01c813f</a>
 kanteer: this is my code rn
 BlaiseEbuth: Both conditions do the same...
 5DN1L: kanteer, do 3 things: 1. move the if before console.log, 2. instead of console.log, assign the values to thrust instead, 3. instead of console.log a fixed thrust value, console.log the "thrust" variable
 5DN1L: (for 2, i mean inside the "if"s)
 5DN1L: The logic is like: In each turn, check the angle to decide the thrust, then output X, Y and thrust.
 kanteer: ok
 5DN1L: Refer to the pseudo-code again
 5DN1L: You should write a code similar to that
 kanteer: ok
 kanteer: im confused
 kanteer: i think i did something wrong?

 dee_vrma: Hello
 5DN1L: kanteer ah, much closer now
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to console.log only once per loop turn kanteer
 jacek: oO
 5DN1L: now try to update your code with the if-else if-else syntax
 kanteer:  BlaiseEbuth i'm confused on what you mean by that
 kanteer: are you saying i only need one if statement?
 BlaiseEbuth: With your current code, if one of the if is true you'll print a first time, then a second time with the final console.log
 kanteer: ok
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: For all you kids out there, programming is one of the first jobs that will be taken over by AI

 Wontonimo: I've got several new puzzles on the go
 jacek: try some puzzles on the chess
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: the new one... goat and cabbage
 Wontonimo: what's their beef?  I read through the fr channel and couldn't see anything related to that puzzle.
 JKing: What does the "I've faced issues with this clash." check box mean?
 Wontonimo: I left it on the contribution board in WIP for 2 weeks, then submit for 2 weeks.  IF people can't bring themselves to comment in that time and just wait till after it is approved then they suck
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: in that case, they said it was very nice 
 Wontonimo: I replied to every post on it
 BlaiseEbuth: C'mon, nobody serious still go in the contib section...
 5DN1L: JKing Check box means you can check it or leave it
 JKing: Specifically "I've faced issues with this clash" though?
 5DN1L: Literal meaning?
 JKing: Yes
 JKing: What happens when I check this box?
 Uljahn: karma of the clash decreases
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: It gets put on the agenda of next shareholders meeting
 JKing: So if it's a reverse with insufficient test cases to get a unique pattern... means I didn't like the clash so mark it as I faced issues?
 5DN1L: If many people downvote a clash, it'll get removed
 JKing: So pretty much just an upvote/downvote, and the clash creator can read their feedback to see why it's being downvoded?
 JKing: Thanks!
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: feedback goes to CG only
 Uljahn: and those who approved it will be punished (not really)

 Husoski: Clash of Code bots are sharing code now??? What's up with that? 
 Schwase: yo theres no forum for haunted manor but one of its test cases definitely violates the constraints of the puzzle
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you share your code
 Automaton2000: ok i think i want to get banned
 5DN1L: Schwase there is a forum thread for Haunted Manor. In fact, 2
 5DN1L: Husoski Did they get 100%? What code did they share?
 Astrobytes: That's normal. The bots take solutions from previous submissions, including whether or not they shared their code.
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 Schwase: 5DN1L i found it
 5DN1L: :ok_hand:
 Husoski: 5DN1L Yes, 100% shared.
 Astrobytes: Husoski: See my previous post
 5DN1L: I haven't met a bot scoring 100% so far :joy:
 Husoski: Astrobytes Normal? I've never seen (noticed) it before last night.
 Astrobytes: It's normal for them to do whatever the submission they are using did
 jacek: i also havent seen normal Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: jacek: :rofl:
 Husoski: That's over 2000 clashes of "not normal" for me.
 Astrobytes: Fair enough, it is what it is. Feel free to contact CG for an explanation.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: On of the 13-year-olds copied a bot name, maybe it was him
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: *one
 Schwase: i have seen plenty of bots share their code
 5DN1L: Oh, yes, check whether the bot's name ends in a dot
 5DN1L: that's not a bot
 Husoski: Nope.  Checked for that.  These are the real ones.
 5DN1L: real not-real person bot :joy:
 Schwase: i specifically remember a bot finishing a clash in a virtually impossible amount of time and just wondering how
 Schwase: and i just checked their code
 Schwase: it was the right answer but just like, why
 Schwase: *it was shortest mode
 Husoski: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2141614150c783f12a01afe9126da30d6397b8e">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2141614150c783f12a01afe9126da30d6397b8e</a>Alkhiljohn and Natchood each shared 100% solutions in JS and Rust, respectively

 Schwase: only me and the bot were nice enough to share our code
 Schwase: smh
 Schwase: bots &gt; people
 Schwase: oh i see, they didnt share their code
 Schwase: that is weird Husoski
 Flaise: All of my friends are bots.
 Flaise: Bots never judge, for they be incapable of judgementation.
 Schwase: they real do be incapable
 Husoski: Others can't see the shares on CoC result links, Schwase.  Only those in the clash are supposed to see it
 Schwase: makes sense
 Husoski: What doesn't make sense is showing somebody else's code on a later clash to people who weren't in the original.
 Schwase: huh? im not sure i understand what you mean by that
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: There are secret things like the JS and Ruby version of exec(unicode).  They could get leak out 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: or more generally golf tips I guess
 Schwase: so?
 Schwase: the point is so people can learn
 Schwase: i always share my golfed code, idc if someone learns how to golf better
 Flaise: Another point is to compete, which necessitates people doing their work in relative isolation.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I'm just speculating why he might care :P
 Schwase: hmmph
 Schwase: i definitely wish there was more code golf puzzles on here, you can only golf the same puzzle for so long, ya know
 Flaise: What do you like about Code Golf?
 Schwase: the nice thing about code golf is that it makes you work on one puzzle more than just what it takes to get the right answer
 Schwase: which in my opinion is very fun and one of the better ways to improve at a specific language
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: the best part is when people find out what the top guys are doing and whine about cheating
 Schwase: shortest mode doesn't force you to learn while youre doing it, so you don't really ever improve without doing it on purpose
 Schwase: doing code golf puzzles makes you figure out how to improve your golfing abilities
 Schwase: Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker you're absolutely right. There's no room for moral grandstanding when there's a leaderboard. The way to win is to get the best score. PERIOD.
 Flaise: Yeah, if you're gonna compete then just compete. lol
 Astrobytes: The bots are there to help you 'enjoy' and 'have fun' with clashes when there aren't enough other clashes. If that sucks, leave clashes with bots in [solved]
 Astrobytes: *clashers
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Well, if the bot is sharing your code from some previous clash that doesn't solve it...
 Astrobytes: I stopped caring about any of this on 15th Dec
 kanteer: gah
 kanteer: help
 DialFrost:&#160;?
 kanteer: what am i doing wrong?
 kanteer: typescript btw
 kanteer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a2c1944d-c82b-44fc-83ae-bae5b45f8ff2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a2c1944d-c82b-44fc-83ae-bae5b45f8ff2</a>
 DialFrost: okey nvrm cant help lol
 kanteer: xd
 Astrobytes: kanteer: follow that code by hand and write out what might happen according to your current logic.
 kanteer: confused on what i gotta write tho
 kanteer: i can't find my mistake
 traagel: is it sufficient to report a bug on discord or do i report it somewhere else too
 DialFrost: schwase bullying everyone in coc
 ninjadip: i've been debgging/tweaking adding to this AI in mad pod for hours.. ugh
 ninjadip: when will it all click? lol
 Thorcode: hehe
 Thorcode: schwase is good
 Thorcode: right?
 Thorcode: I'm gonna solo Schwase
 DialFrost: orh
 Wontonimo: hey ninjadip , aer you still working on mad pod racing?  
 Wontonimo: I can give you a hand if yo ulike
 Thorcode: he do that pod well wonton
 Thorcode: his code is clean
 Thorcode: even though I don't really understand his c or c++ code
 Wontonimo: hey kanteer , the code you shared will prrint twice each round.  That will make your pod get out of sync with the input and effectively react to old data.
 Wontonimo: only output once per turn
 Wontonimo: he is still aiming at the checkpoint, not slowing down ahead of time, not drifting, not attacking.  lots of things can be added.
 Jerrasterix: Good morning Guys!!
 Jerrasterix: ohh hello Wontonimo
 ninjadip: ty wo
 ninjadip: just saw that
 ninjadip: yeah i'm working on it, but i don't think i have much left
 traagel: can you look at other peoples code in games&#160;?
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: but you can look at how their bot behaves and get a lot of info from that
 traagel: Any estimate for the ranking fix? I was asked to do it for a job interview and wanted to impress :sweat_smile:
 Thorcode: wana
 antiwonto: nothing more impressive than being num 1
 traagel: i wanna keep adding features but im afraid a new iteration will be worse so i dont want to risk it :joy:
 Wontonimo: you can always re-submit your old code.  it is saved in the "history" on the left
 traagel: i know but the ranking is a bit rng
 traagel: and it takes 45 minutes to run
 antiwonto: which multi traagel&#160;?
 traagel: huh?
 antiwonto: which game, which bot battle traagel&#160;?
 traagel: mad pod racing
 traagel: or coders strike back

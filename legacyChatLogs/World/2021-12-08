 rizonbro: go to c folder
 rizonbro: and user
 rizonbro: and app data
 rizonbro: and roami and local
 rizonbro: its real
 rizonbro:  I am not lie
 Overbed: hello can i post a code here and can anyone figure out whats wrong with it?
 rizonbro: ok
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da18062e-ff07-4da1-989d-7d86df3aed2b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da18062e-ff07-4da1-989d-7d86df3aed2b</a>
 rizonbro: input it is
 Overbed: i need to find the circles a 
 Overbed: number has
 rizonbro: wait open visual and text it html:5 and make folder bedore the file make html and copy the code there in the visual studio code and the abswer is be correct
 Overbed: bruh what is an ASCII value
 Uljahn: "for i in range(s)" is wrong i guess
 Overbed: why?
 rizonbro: maybe
 rizonbro: I am like that I sad
 Overbed: whats the good like for i in range then?
 Overbed: what was wrong
 Uljahn: it gives you all numbers from 0 to s-1, and you need to examine the digits of s
 rizonbro: and open browers and left click and name broswer
 Overbed: would it be better to make a variable and then make it 10 and then use it in the range?
 Overbed: sorry i am a newbie
 rizonbro: no what you use languga
 rizonbro: :troll:
 Overbed: i use python
 rizonbro: bruh use pycharm
 Overbed: what
 Uljahn: you have to iterate the digits of s, try this:for digit in str(s):
 rizonbro: for python nake
 Uljahn: rizonbro: could you please stop spreading nonsense
 Overbed: my clash of code already expired sadly
 rizonbro: ok
 rizonbro: uljahn

 rizonbro: maybe
 Uljahn: input some keywords and use serach
 Uljahn: *search
 Overbed: oh i found it
 Overbed: ErrorsValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ' 'at Answer.py. in &lt;module&gt; on line 5
 Overbed: for digit in str(s):
 Overbed: it gives error
 5DN1L: can s be negative?
 Overbed: you mean in my code?
 5DN1L: no, the input
 Overbed: no
 Overbed: but its something like
 Overbed: 8888 9235 2832 2875
 5DN1L: oh there are spaces in between
 Overbed: 1111 3213 7662
 Overbed: yes how do i like fix the error code?
 5DN1L: you have to remove the spaces first
 5DN1L: or split
 5DN1L: depending whether the code asks for the values separately or not
 5DN1L: for each number
 Overbed: how do i do that exactly
 5DN1L: the link?
 5DN1L: to the question i mean
 Uljahn: guess it's Useful digits
 Overbed: remove(s, "")
 Overbed: or s = s.remove(" ")
 5DN1L: if the whole string requires just 1 answer, then just remove the spaces
 Overbed: what do you mean
 5DN1L: if the different numbers should be handled one by one, then split it
 Overbed: it needs to be 1 answer
 Overbed: not 8  9
 Overbed: or something
 5DN1L: Uljahn ok i'll search it
 5DN1L: thanks
 Overbed: yes its useful digits

 5DN1L: great&#160;:)
 5DN1L: ah, ok
 5DN1L: just remove the spaces
 Overbed: how
 5DN1L: similar to what you wrote
 5DN1L: oops
 5DN1L: no
 5DN1L: replace
 5DN1L: use the replace function
 Overbed: s = input.replace(" ", "")?
 5DN1L: input()
 5DN1L: add the brackets there
 Overbed: s = input().replace(" ", "")
 Overbed: diesbt wirj
 Overbed: work

 Overbed: got this but doesnt work
 Overbed: doesnt count them up or something
 Uljahn: a = 0 and b = 0 should be outside the loop i guess
 Overbed: yes! it works
 Overbed: is there any way to make this code smaller?
 5DN1L: Yes, but you'd better try it yourself first?
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/</a>
 Overbed: you cant do something like if i== 0,9,6:
 5DN1L: can't, but you can if i in [0,9,6]:
 Uljahn: also a+=1
 Overbed: i got it a whole lot smaller now
 lakaoe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5c988fd9-d277-48df-aec0-52d5b58945df">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5c988fd9-d277-48df-aec0-52d5b58945df</a>
 Overbed: why create 4 variables
 Uljahn: you could use s.count("8")*2+s.count("6")+...
 Uljahn: no need to loop
 lakaoe: im a beginner so that was all ive learned
 Overbed: whats the count function?
 Uljahn: read the docs
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count</a>
 Overbed: thanks
 Overbed: s.count("8")+2+s.count["6","9","0"]+1
 Overbed: doesnt work
 5DN1L: because count accepts only one string as the string argument
 Overbed: that means?
 5DN1L: you can put three strings "6", "9", "0" in one count
 Overbed: i can only do 1 number in brackets?
 5DN1L: can't*
 5DN1L: yup
 5DN1L: and in () not in []
 Overbed: ah
 Overbed: s = input()print(s.count("8")+2+s.count("6")+1+s.count("9")+1+s.count("0")+1)
 Overbed: print out 9
 Overbed: it is supposed to be 6
 5DN1L: +1 not needed
 5DN1L: +2 should be *2
 Overbed: why?
 5DN1L: you count the number of 8
 5DN1L: then multiply by 2
 5DN1L: you count the number of 6
 5DN1L: then multiply by 1
 5DN1L: or not
 5DN1L: because no difference whether multiply by 1 or not
 5DN1L: similarly for 9 and 0
 Overbed: what would happen if input was 5243 and print(s.count("5")*2)
 5DN1L: what do you think?
 Overbed: i have actually no idea
 Overbed: 10
 5DN1L: "5" is a string
 Overbed: i dont understand
 5DN1L: 5*2=10
 5DN1L: "5"*2="55"
 5DN1L: "5243".count("5")=1
 5DN1L: numbers and strings are different things
 Overbed: oh so without " is times eachother
 Overbed: and
 Overbed: "8"*2="88"?
 5DN1L: yes, because "" makes the digit a string
 5DN1L: correct
 5DN1L: without "" it's a number
 Overbed: but how does this represent 
 Overbed: the circles
 lakaoe: it doesnt
 lakaoe: i thikn
 Overbed: OHHHH i get it
 Overbed: wow
 lakaoe: it says the numbers not how many circles
 Overbed: 8 is the value of 8
 Overbed: 2*
 5DN1L: yes
 Overbed: and when u .count it
 Overbed: it has 2 "8" and then times 2
 Overbed: 2 * 2 = 4
 Overbed: right?
 5DN1L: step by step
 5DN1L: s.count(t) means you count how many times t appears in s
 Overbed: yes
 5DN1L: so "5243".count("5") means you count how many 5 appears in "5243"
 Overbed: omg ty this helps alot
 5DN1L: hence the answer is 1
 lakaoe: and if it would be "55241"
 5DN1L: "5243".count("5")*2 = 1*2 = 2
 Overbed: i get it now :grin:
 lakaoe: it would say theres 2 fives
 5DN1L: great&#160;:)
 Overbed: is "and" a function?
 Overbed: is "and" a function?
 Overbed: chat is lagging my bad
 Uljahn: and is an operator i guess
 Overbed: how can i make a code so i can see who wins in rock paper scissors
 Overbed: if you can help me a bit i dont need the entire code just a function
 Overbed: that would work
 Uljahn: is it CG puzzle or clash?
 Overbed: clash
 Overbed: You must output who wins or DRAWby Tanvir

 5DN1L: (fill in the blanks)

 Jerrasterix: ofc&#160;!!
 derjack: its up to golf police
 5DN1L: lol
 Overbed: i already thought
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah you could be arrested for that
 Overbed: what
 5DN1L: As long as you submit the code and nobody arrests you then it's fine :shrug:
 Overbed: bro
 Overbed: why
 Overbed: arrest?
 Thorcode: exec(bytes('‰Ωí‰≠É‚Ä¨‰çìÂçâ‰ΩìÂçí‚Ä¨‰Öê‰ïê‚Åí‚ÄΩ‚∞∞„Ñ†‚Ä¨‡®≤‚±°Êà†„¥†Ê¥†ÁÅ°Êî®ÊÖ∂‚±¨Ê§†ÁÅÆÁëµ‚§®ÁåÆÊ±∞Áë©‚§®‡®©Áâ∞Êπ©‚°¥‰ê¢‰Öí‚âóÊ§†‚Å¶‚Å°„¥ΩÊà†‚Ää‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä†Êî†Áç¨‚Å•ÂÄ¢‰Öå‰ïô‚âí‚Ä†Áå´Áâ¥‚†®‚Å°„¥Ω‚††‚Å¢‚Ä´‚§±‚î†„å†‚Ä©‚Ä´‚§±‚Ä©','u16')[2:])
 Thorcode: this is shorter XD
 Overbed:&#160;?
 Jerrasterix: you can even to sentenced to serve a life time writing golfed code
 Overbed: so can i get banned for using
 derjack: opening books everywhere :unamused:
 Overbed: shortening
 Overbed: is golfing bannable or bot
 Uljahn: no
 Overbed: not
 Overbed: it isnt bannable?
 Overbed: so exec(bytes('‰Ωí‰≠É‚Ä¨‰çìÂçâ‰ΩìÂçí‚Ä¨‰Öê‰ïê‚Åí‚ÄΩ‚∞∞„Ñ†‚Ä¨‡®≤‚±°Êà†„¥†Ê¥†ÁÅ°Êî®ÊÖ∂‚±¨Ê§†ÁÅÆÁëµ‚§®ÁåÆÊ±∞Áë©‚§®‡®©Áâ∞Êπ©‚°¥‰ê¢‰Öí‚âóÊ§†‚Å¶„µ°ÊàΩ‚Ää‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä†Êî†Áç¨‚â•‰±êÂ•ÅÂâÖ‚¨¢Áë≥‚°≤ÊÑ®„¥ΩÊà®‚Ä†„Ñ´‚î©‚§≥„Ñ´‚§©','u16')[2:]) is allowed
 Jerrasterix: yeah 
 Uljahn: why not?
 Overbed: in official clash of codes?
 Jerrasterix: its a loophole 
 Overbed: idk
 Overbed: maybe like
 Overbed: that its from a website
 Overbed: idk
 Uljahn: there is no readability requirements
 Uljahn: you can do it yourself
 Jerrasterix: it needs to work at end of the day 
 Overbed: so i can use some weird golfing website and not get banned
 Uljahn: i don't use sites
 Overbed: huh
 5DN1L: but if you can't even write the main code, how do you shorten it
 Overbed: you make them yourselves?
 Jerrasterix: you will not learn anything 
 Overbed: can you shorten something yourselves
 Uljahn: sure
 Overbed: how
 Overbed: what
 Overbed: whats golfing
 Jerrasterix: isn't the whole point of code golfing&#160;?? :confused:
 Overbed: can you make a code 1 character long if you do it right?
 Jerrasterix: if others are all 0% then you can 
 Overbed: i dont get it
 Uljahn: byte_string = b"Compress with utf-16"compressed = byte_string.decode('u16')print(compressed)print(len(byte_string), len(compressed))
 Overbed: ill just use the random website for golfing
 Overbed: whats that supposed to mean
 NotGoodatall: what language do yall use 
 Overbed: python3
 TeslaRam: c++
 NotGoodatall: i use C#
 Jerrasterix: C and C#
 Overbed: why is golfing script weird chinese characters 
 Wontonimo: people use this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 Overbed: yes i got sent that aswell
 Overbed: but why is it weird characters
 Overbed: nvm i have 1 question and that is if people use golfing for like virusses and stuff
 gems20: java
 Uljahn: those chinese characters still count as 1 char each, but have a capacity of 2 bytes or so
 Thorcode: yeah
 gems20: help me 
 5DN1L: gems20 you still haven't told us your question
 Jerrasterix: anyway, we will do this method and still get 50 chars and some ruby coder will one line it in 34 chars :unamused:
 Jerrasterix: ohh, CG doesn't have julia&#160;??

 eulerscheZahl: nice
 GamingGnawer: @hadok have you tried learncpp.com?
 Westicles: hey euler, can your cheating detector tell which account is the source?
 eulerscheZahl: no. sometimes it's even none of the multiplayer bots
 eulerscheZahl: but some player who never submitted the contest bot in the multiplayer section
 eulerscheZahl: and for some games like Tron it has really poor detection because of randomness
 Westicles: Ah, okay.  Seems like publishing is a bigger sin than copy-pasting
 eulerscheZahl: actually i'm a friend of sharing and open-source if it wasn't for the nasty side-effects
 eulerscheZahl: some take the bot to learn and improve. others for a quick 5min of glory
 struct: all my bots are available, you just need to look hard enough
 slyforrow: wee
 eulerscheZahl: publicly available?
 darkhorse64: There are also some well known names (people with rocket CP progress, people caught cheating during contests)
 struct: no, bad joke sorry
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but a few surprises were waiting for myself too when i clicked through the results of my script
 eulerscheZahl: note: for some games it's really possible to have false positives. for BTTC i managed to get a perfectly identical match for #1 and #50-ishthen changed the seed
 eulerscheZahl: for other games it's highly unlikely to happen. also there is some clustering between suspicious replays and languages (which i didn't take into account for my analysis)
 darkhorse64: Yes, I will not call any names by  drawing premature conclusions but I have seen some surprises
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait for thibaud to dig through it (or dismiss it, we'll see)
 struct: is not like cg is not aware 
 eulerscheZahl: but now i made a nice list that's harder to ignore :P
 struct: Did it change since the last time I checked? ~1 week ago
 eulerscheZahl: maybe 1 or 2 replays added. so not really
 eulerscheZahl: just updating as top100 change
 darkhorse64: For HS, top 100 is not enough
 eulerscheZahl: i know. but didn't feel like raising the limit just for that one game
 kovi: you analyzed game logs to check duplicated behaviour?
 kovi: from your own games (batch?), or all?
 JZLX: how can i look 
 Mayday666: ahhhhhhh
 jacek: cg is not oware of the clones?
 Uljahn: "multiplayer is a zoo" and CP stands for copy&amp;paste points :smirk:
 jacek: CP stands for many things :no_mouth:
 struct: jacek is your nnm bot a NN?
 Westicles: You bot guys are devious.  I stick to the puzzles since I am highly ethical
 eulerscheZahl: hi kovi, i was afki generated games myself. play each bot vs itself on the same seed and compared replays
 eulerscheZahl: for context: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/leaderboard-cleanup/193779">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/leaderboard-cleanup/193779</a>
 Flaise: CP can stand for computer player
 eulerscheZahl: i know it as "competitive programming"
 Portaljacker: us older internet users know it as something rather awful
 TimberStalker: I just finished the last half of the CoC quest line in like 5 minutes because all i had left was to beat a shortest CoC
 jacek: struct no, good old alphabeta
 jacek: with evaluation evolved by GA
 jacek: i was surprised by some values changed drastically depending on game phase
 jacek: so many python bots in wood1 :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i won't index community contributions
 struct: I dont think theres copy pasted bots, at least at the top
 struct: for community ones
 eulerscheZahl: even if i noticed something suspicious myself while playing coders of the realm (a few submitted the boss)
 eulerscheZahl: but i agree that the top should be pretty clean for community games

 jacek: germans...
 LazyfromDiscord: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: anyone try kite.com&#160;?  it's like github copilot
 eulerscheZahl: i've heard the name
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to install it to atom maybe a year ago but it never finished installing
 eulerscheZahl: now i don't even use atom anymore
 Wontonimo: is there a feature request channel on CGs slack?
 eulerscheZahl: there is no public CG slack anymore
 eulerscheZahl: afaik they have a private slack
 eulerscheZahl: and trello board, but i'm not sure if i remembered that part correctly
 Wontonimo: sorry, i meant discord
 eulerscheZahl: there's a bug reports channel
 eulerscheZahl: i used it once to suggest a feature (move viewer from bottom of a puzzle landing page to the top to showcase it more), never heard from it since
 struct: what feature do you want Wontonimo?
 Westicles: unban?
 Wontonimo: Being able to "Remix" an existing bot of someone else's.  You don't get to see the code (*) and your bot gets flagged as a "remix of [name here]" but it is super easy to do, way easier than googling and copying code from internet
 Wontonimo: the remix would not be in the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: sounds extremely unlikely to happen to me
 Westicles: lol.  not a chance
 Wontonimo: haha
 eulerscheZahl: first of all you talk about bots. those aren't a priority
 Wontonimo: right
 eulerscheZahl: even if, that would be a rare use-case
 eulerscheZahl: let me say it this way: respected community members that you don't even know (long before your time) like inoryy wanted to see the timeouts/crashes of their last submit highlighted in the last battles
 Wontonimo: what I was thinking is if a section of code is surrounded with /* PUBLIC START */ /* PUBLIC END */ then that section of code becomes visible to the remixer and they can modifity or add to it
 eulerscheZahl: or something against AI hiding. we still don't have those features
 Wontonimo: right
 Wontonimo: okay
 Wontonimo: good point
 NotANick: so why i am getting %25 score with passing all tests and without cheating outputs
 eulerscheZahl: which puzzle?
 Coderboi270: hi
 NotANick: clash
 eulerscheZahl: which clash?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>find it, then we keep talking
 NotANick: it says failure now xd
 eulerscheZahl: failure where?
 NotANick: in tests
 NotANick: with my code
 Wontonimo: I posted my feature anyway.  I work in software and am keenly aware that most feature requests never see more than 2 min of attention, and that's okay.
 NotANick: in clash it passed all tests
 Westicles: If we had a faq, I would point you to #3
 eulerscheZahl: do you use random in your code?
 NotANick: anyway sorry for disturbing
 NotANick: no
 Westicles: 3) The world also needs fry cooks
 eulerscheZahl: you can keep disturbing if you
 NotANick: &lt;?php fscanf(STDIN,"%d",$a);fscanf(STDIN,"%d",$b);fscanf(STDIN,"%d",$c);echo($b-($a*120)-$c&lt;0?"true":"false");?&gt;

 eulerscheZahl: oh, a shortest mode?
 NotANick: yes xd
 Westicles: oh, never mind.  you know stuff
 eulerscheZahl: echo(($a*120)-$b-$c&gt;=0?"true":"false");
 eulerscheZahl: that's passing
 eulerscheZahl: you had rent - pay - other costscorrect ispay - rent - other costs
 NotANick: yes thank you very much forhelping
 NotANick: and i found new way for getting stdin in shortest mode
 NotANick: $c=STDIN;fscanf($c,"%d",$a);fscanf($c,"%d",$d);fscanf($c,"%d",$n);
 eulerscheZahl: $f=fscanf;$f($c, ...
 eulerscheZahl: does that work too?
 NotANick: i will try
 NotANick: wow it really works
 NotANick: thanks
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if I cant set the altitude index for The Decent challenge how am i even supposed to get an algo going if the input resets everything?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its actually quite a ridiculous, uhm how I should say "game question" because intuitively, you would change the altitude at which you were shooting, and on top of that the input doesnt allow you keep on printing, because the input halts print statements so like if u wanted create a pee shooter type of program, u cant
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its actually quite ridiculous if u think about it, because theres lack of imagination or room for imagination
 jacek: hm?
 camnwalter: sup
 jacek: initialize index variable before the loop
 Considerably_Disagreeable: how would u do that, the game requires it to be in loop
 Considerably_Disagreeable: u cant execute outside of loop
 5DN1L: why not
 struct: the loop gets called every new turn
 Illedan: It is just code. You can do whatever you want
 struct: you must output the index of the highest for every turn
 Considerably_Disagreeable: correct
 struct: the inputs are new every turn based on your previous action
 Considerably_Disagreeable: exactly and i tried a simple bubble sort but that doesnt even work either
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i even tried the reversed order method, didnt work
 struct: well you dont need sort at all
 Considerably_Disagreeable: and you cant just like easily execute outside of the loop, the loop requires input that sets the altitude, you cant just like teleport outside of the loop
 Considerably_Disagreeable: you cant set the alt outside the loop
 Considerably_Disagreeable: thats just not, correct
 struct: why would you need to sort?
 struct: 8, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 1
 Considerably_Disagreeable: in case values are different upon input
 struct: do you need to sort those values to get the highest index?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so i would always be shooting the greatest or close to the greatest value as possible
 jacek: the puzzle has hints on the left
 jacek: and even full solution
 struct: You are probably overthinking
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I am not looking for fake solutions, I call them fake because its copy pasta
 Considerably_Disagreeable: thats not coding
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Considerably_Disagreeable: dont take that as an insult, but I am looking for an intuitive way of solving this
 struct: well Im trying to help
 Considerably_Disagreeable: you are and i love oyu &lt;3
 struct: but you are just saying its impossible
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ^ yeah i hate my mentality too
 Illedan: What language are you using&#160;?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: python
 Illedan: Ok, give me a sec
 jacek: no NN solutions on this like in onboarding&#160;:(
 Illedan: Ok, I forgot python, but something like this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/kjOmMRb">https://tech.io/snippet/kjOmMRb</a>Would keep some data outside the loop, which you can access every iteration
 AmitBG: someone got job from this game?
 Illedan: By doing CodinGame?
 AmitBG: By geting skiils and then ...
 AmitBG: you get it 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: wait in python you can serialize data like that?
 GER-NaN: i started getting recruitment emails after entering my info.... 
 pmor: my company uses codingame for interview prescreening
 Illedan: Sure, the interviews I attended last year was some "easy" puzzle tasks, which was easy because of CodinGame :P
 struct: they asked me to get top 3 in csb&#160;:(
 Illedan: Considerably_Disagreeable, I don't remember how to write python anymore, but it was to give you some guideline :P
 Illedan: lol struct
 jacek: in what?
 struct: mpr sorry
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I see I see
 Illedan: One interviewer I had was really sure I could sort a list in N time... Yeah, he was wrong :P
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I hate being timed
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its make me rush then i fuck up and my thoughts go crazy
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i cant control it

 jacek: isnt max reserved in python?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so with things like this, why is there even an if conditional? Why is it wrong without it? 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: isnt it the same as this and if so why is this answer wrong? while 1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/53cc3581-1936-4221-80a7-f4006c33da27">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/53cc3581-1936-4221-80a7-f4006c33da27</a>
 5DN1L: Jacek you can use it if you want :shrug:
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its like creating a pointless conditional
 Considerably_Disagreeable: that makes absolutely no sense...
 Considerably_Disagreeable: hey its the solution on the website
 5DN1L: Jacek just that if you use max as a variable name, you won't be able to use it as a keyword any more
 Considerably_Disagreeable: like mountain_h is always going to be greater than max which is 0, max and imax are useless instantiations the conditional is useless, shadowing the variable is the exact same way because mountain h is always going to be greater than the input
 Considerably_Disagreeable: it makes no sense why my answer is wrong without a conditional
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because the conditional would be there even if its not there
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because its always going to be true
 5DN1L: Considerably_Disagreeable, if you leave out "if" condition, you'll always read the next mountain height and put it into MAX, no matter whether it's highest or not
 jacek: and IMAX will be always 7 after the loop
 5DN1L: yes ^
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so you are pulling the index to which the greatest value is coming from?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: in a temp var
 5DN1L: the temp var will always be correct at the end if you just replace its value only when needed
 jacek: try to go through this algorithm on paper
 Considerably_Disagreeable: isnt this the same as what is the solution while 1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e6facdc-9402-4199-9fe9-8921002ba534">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e6facdc-9402-4199-9fe9-8921002ba534</a>
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ignore the max and imax values
 Considerably_Disagreeable: that are lowercase
 5DN1L: we aren't comparing with 0
 Considerably_Disagreeable: max is 0
 5DN1L: we're comparing with the highest height we've seen so far
 struct: how do you check which one is the highest without the if?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: how is is comparing max=0 comparing to the highest height?
 5DN1L: whenever we see a higher height, we replace max with that
 Considerably_Disagreeable: max = 0
 Considerably_Disagreeable: and integer
 struct: that is not a comparison 
 struct: thats an assignment
 BartholomewIII: Getting the maximum of [4, 3, 2, 1] using both algorithms
 Considerably_Disagreeable: wouldnt u use something along the lines like, max(mountain_h)
 Considerably_Disagreeable: max is always 0
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because u set it to 0
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ur not pulling the max value of the mountains
 struct: How long ago did you started programming?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if mountain_h &gt; max:
 Considerably_Disagreeable: and max = 0
 struct: max = 0 before the for loop
 struct: the for loop checks all the mountains 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i see
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so when u shadow after the first time
 Considerably_Disagreeable: u are comparing the shadow
 Astrobytes: in that case max(mountain_h) == mountain_h, if you stored all the heights in a list or something you could do max(mountain_height_list)
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ^
 Considerably_Disagreeable: that is what I was talking about
 Considerably_Disagreeable: but am i right on that assumption prior? like about the shadowing?
 Astrobytes: but that is max as a keyword, you are using it as a variable here
 Considerably_Disagreeable: exactly
 Considerably_Disagreeable: which was my confusion
 Considerably_Disagreeable: but if u overshadow it then compare the shadow
 Considerably_Disagreeable: that makes sense
 BartholomewIII: I would use a different variable name, like "max_" or "maximum"
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I would too, I am going to its just what the solution has, its like using dict = 1
 Astrobytes: the solution is pseudocode
 BlaiseEbuth: C'mon... It's already python.
 BartholomewIII: Pfft
 Considerably_Disagreeable: you guys are like angels from the depths of love
 Considerably_Disagreeable: everyone else is assholes when im trying to understand and its like yeah I get it, I have a hard time understanding but dont give up on me damn
 jacek: angels? here? oO
 Considerably_Disagreeable: and i get that i am an asshole but i am more frustrated with my stupidity than you are uk
 BlaiseEbuth: More demons from the depths of hell...
 jacek: only astro is uk
 Considerably_Disagreeable: *more than you prolly are uk

 Illedan: Ukulele
 Astrobytes: There is no UK. Only a fragmented mess of filth.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I think thats the world dont feel bad 
 Astrobytes: I can't play ukulele, just mandolin and banjo
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I can rap vary, vary badly
 Considerably_Disagreeable: industry hates
 BlaiseEbuth: I play triangle.
 Illedan: I can't even play that
 Astrobytes: Hm. Anyway, my hair just called, it needs a wash. Back later, perhaps.
 Illedan: gl hf
 eulerscheZahl: i can play keyboard. but not the instrument
 e_fishel: is it wrong to share a snippet of my code to my friend to help him solve a problem?
 Illedan: A puzzle?
 e_fishel: yes
 Illedan: Should be fine&#160;:) We are here to learn
 eulerscheZahl: if it's to help understanding and not for a copy-paste solution i don'T see a problem

 jacek: does Automaton2000 like to be compared?
 Automaton2000: don't tell me that i can do that
 Overbed: message = input()for i in message:
 Overbed: how to make this
 Overbed: code so it doesnt print snake case 2 times
 Overbed: and can only print it 1 time
 jacek: add break?
 Overbed: how?
 Azkellas: or `if "_" in message:`
 jacek: next line after print
 Azkellas: assuming python
 Overbed: yes python
 KoaO: :grin:
 Overbed: whats the website called for the puzzles

 Overbed: what part?
 jacek: did you mean elif message[0].isupper():

 Overbed: is me asking for help
 Overbed: not a self learner?
 Overbed: i dont have a teacher or anything
 jacek: if you dont learn from classes/school or university then its self learning
 Overbed: that means i am a self learner
 Overbed: how long did it take for you 5dn1l to get so good?

 Considerably_Disagreeable: why would this be printing the first 3rd element then resume iterating through the entire alphabet?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7a4bad9-17c7-4301-9511-f080a9d5ad13">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7a4bad9-17c7-4301-9511-f080a9d5ad13</a>
 Considerably_Disagreeable: all i am asking for is it to print the index+3 not hte index+3 and the rest of the alphabet?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: why is it it doing that?
 struct: you never exit the for loop
 struct: you need break;
 struct: or something
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if i do that then it only prints the first 3rd element
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i need to keep doing that
 Considerably_Disagreeable: hence the control statement over the while
 struct: "why would this be printing the first 3rd element then resume iterating through the entire alphabet?" this was your original question
 Considerably_Disagreeable: yes
 Ezuker: Who is good in Java 
 Ezuker: I need help with IndexOF
 Considerably_Disagreeable: when i run the code i get this
 Considerably_Disagreeable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/284cb5fd-6628-445c-9ef0-a88be639e5cd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/284cb5fd-6628-445c-9ef0-a88be639e5cd</a>
 struct: yes
 struct: because the for loop keeps going
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if it keeps going why is it not printing index+3
 Considerably_Disagreeable: also, if i reach the 23rd index and print +3 i get an out of index error, makes sense not that many indexes in the alphabet, but why is there not function to re iterate through like a continue statement in java?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: makes absolutely no sense.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: How am i supposed to write an algo, when I cant even re use a loop iteration....
 struct: break will exit the for loop if thats what you want
 Considerably_Disagreeable: no I want to print the 3rd index of the alphabet
 Considerably_Disagreeable: every third index
 struct: for each letter of the string given?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so 3,6,9,...
 Considerably_Disagreeable: 3 will be d 6 will be g and so on
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its vary unintuitive to not be able to re use a loop iteration

 struct: print(alphabet[(index+3)&#160;% 26])
 Considerably_Disagreeable: mind blown
 Considerably_Disagreeable: why does that work now?
 struct: because it doenst go out of range
 Considerably_Disagreeable: modulos takes the remainder right?
 struct: the alphabet has 26 letters
 struct: 25%26 = 25
 struct: 26% 26 = 0
 struct: yes

 Salick: I need help with one c++ task
 Salick: can someone help me please&#160;?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: not if they have you struct&#160;;) You literally made me see things no one else could
 Kailynn: Ok so no one can help
 struct: whats the question Salick?
 struct: Kailynn well if you are new to coding I would get some experience before coming here
 struct: 1-2 months experience at least
 Kailynn: Ok
 Wontonimo: omg struct, what did you make Considerably_Disagreeable see that *no one else could*&#160;?!?
 Wontonimo: Kailynn , you may find this really useful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA</a>
 Wontonimo: it is how to code tic-tac-toe using javascript
 Wontonimo: by "The Coding Train" none-the-less
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 BartholomewIII: o/
 Thorcode: yes, I can move to the ghost now, but how can I capture it
 Wontonimo: hey people
 UZUHAMA: case expressions must be constant expressions
 UZUHAMA: What a dumb error...
 UZUHAMA: You should be able to put variables in there
 BartholomewIII: What language?
 UZUHAMA: Java
 BartholomewIII: Also, the reason why is because switch-statements are optimized to be much faster than if-else chains
 BartholomewIII: And you can't do that with variable case statements
 UZUHAMA: hmm
 UZUHAMA: Guess I'll just have to use if-else chain...
 Dren: is it a compile time lookup table?
 BartholomewIII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/767840/4373214">https://stackoverflow.com/a/767840/4373214</a>
 BartholomewIII: Yeah
 BartholomewIII: This is for C#, but I think the same reasoning applies
 UZUHAMA: hmm
 UZUHAMA: Don't know what a lookup table and hash list are
 UZUHAMA: But I got the point
 Wontonimo: what programming lang do you use UZUHAMA&#160;?
 UZUHAMA: I use Java
 Wontonimo: so in java there is something called a HashMap
 Wontonimo: (you can google that)
 UZUHAMA: ok
 UZUHAMA: wait a sec
 Wontonimo: but generally what it allows you to do is make a name-value pair
 Wontonimo: so you can save stuff using a name and get back the associated value
 Wontonimo: REALLY FAST
 Wontonimo: so
 Wontonimo: if you have a list of students and their final grade
 Wontonimo: HashMap finals = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();
 Wontonimo: finals.put("Billy",33);
 Wontonimo: finals.put("Jane",98)
 Wontonimo: then you can get Jane's score like so
 Wontonimo: Integer j = finals.get("Jane");
 Wontonimo: does this make sense?
 UZUHAMA: Ok, I now kind of get it
 Wontonimo: kinda?  tell me more, what's fuzzy?
 UZUHAMA: No, I get it
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: can i tell you a SUPER cool use of it?
 UZUHAMA: so, the hash list is just a list of hashmap?
 UZUHAMA: Yeah, sure tell me
 Wontonimo: so, let's say you want a count of all the unique words in a very large document ...
 Wontonimo: the pseudo code is like so
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4348dcbe-00b6-4715-a625-a3bef3806bba">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4348dcbe-00b6-4715-a625-a3bef3806bba</a>
 Wontonimo: that's it
 Wontonimo: the hash makes it super fast.
 Wontonimo: and the lookup time to get a value out of the hash is constant.  If there are 2 elements or 2 million, it takes the same time.
 Wontonimo: This is very different than a list or a binary tree.
 UZUHAMA: Ooh
 UZUHAMA: Ok so
 Wontonimo: yeah man!  They are powerful!
 UZUHAMA: What pseudocode does is 
 UZUHAMA: make a new hash if there's no hash for a word
 Wontonimo: yup
 UZUHAMA: Then increment the count of the corresponding word
 UZUHAMA: Wow
 UZUHAMA: Wait 
 Wontonimo: yup!  even if the document is 100MB or data you'll only have to make 1 pass through it and it will be fast
 Wontonimo: *of data
 UZUHAMA: I think I heard the same thing somewhere
 UZUHAMA: The entire language itself was devoted to hash list
 UZUHAMA: j something...
 UZUHAMA: jason?
 Wontonimo: in python it is called a Dictionary.  In javascript it is called an AssociativeArray
 Wontonimo: nope, not Json (it's spelt json)
 UZUHAMA: oh yeah lol
 UZUHAMA: JSON is just a hash list
 UZUHAMA: right?
 Wontonimo: but kinda, json can have hash lists in it, but it isn't a programming language
 Wontonimo: yes, JSON is a combination of arrays and associative arrays
 UZUHAMA: Oh, it isn't?
 UZUHAMA: hmm
 Wontonimo: this is json[ 1 , 2, 3 ]
 Wontonimo: and this is{"one"&#160;: 1 , "two"&#160;: 2 , "threeeee"&#160;: 3 }
 UZUHAMA: So, JSON is just a fancy way of calling associative arrays?
 Wontonimo: no, json is json.
 Wontonimo: it is a format for printing data structures
 UZUHAMA: :eye: :eye:
 Wontonimo: to send data to and from popular programming languages
 UZUHAMA: Wait, json can be file extension
 UZUHAMA:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: java and python and javascript are programming languages.  They can have an hash in memory.  Json is a format for dumping list and hashs to files or strings
 Wontonimo: and converting it back again
 Dren: yes .json files exist
 Wontonimo: yes
 UZUHAMA: ohh ok
 UZUHAMA: I get it now
 Considerably_Disagreeable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fca1bbc8-ccc5-47b9-8bd9-0ec918e98dd4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fca1bbc8-ccc5-47b9-8bd9-0ec918e98dd4</a>
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so if i wanted to like re arrange these shifted letters, back into the same order or the word, how would i go about that
 UZUHAMA: Thx Wontonimo and Dren
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so like GFRGHA
 UZUHAMA: :thumbsup:
 UZUHAMA: You guys are the best
 RangeError: Hello all, I have test on this platform for c# and sql, when I click on it, I have like 1 hour max to solve it, anyone who knows how is it working. It is like clash of code or what, because I only used this to play CoC&#160;?
 Wontonimo: can you give a smaller example Considerably_Disagreeable for just the question?
 Dren: first of all
 Dren: you should use enumerate
 Wontonimo: don't know RangeError
 Dren: so instead of:for i in range(len(text)):
 Dren: it should be for index, character in enumerate(text):
 BartholomewIII: RangeError If you take a language certification test on this platform, you can take the sample test with no penalties to see what it's like
 Dren: and get both at the same time since you use both in every loop
 Considerably_Disagreeable: how do i know when to use len of something then
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ill change though but how do i get it back in order though
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because when it matches it matches in the order of cddeox
 Wontonimo: what puzzle is this?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: Code Breaker Puzzle, I am encrypting a message to see how the algo works 
 Wontonimo: i think i know that puzzle
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so that I can then decrypt the message
 Wontonimo: let's say you have a function that does this
 Wontonimo: and if a=1 and b=0 and letter='A'and your alphabet is 'ABCED...'
 Wontonimo: then this function would return 'B'
 Wontonimo: right?
 Wontonimo: well, if you do, then you could ...
 Wontonimo: wait for it ...
 Wontonimo: use a hashmap to make a lookup to reverse the encryption
 Considerably_Disagreeable: nonono
 Wontonimo: no need to actually reverse the encryption
 Considerably_Disagreeable: im not reversing yet
 Wontonimo: have you made the above function yet?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i simply want to rearrange, the order of the encryption to the order of the word
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so the word is still encrypted
 5922:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: rearrange the order of the encryption?  why?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: wouldnt it be best practice to?
 5922: To minimize computation you mean?
 Wontonimo: the alphabet is in a-very-specific-and-important-order
 Wontonimo: the alphabet 'abcd' is different than 'bacd'
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ok, let me try to repharse
 5922: Do you mean you are only encrypting the word and not the message or what
 5922: er alphabet
 5922: sorry
 Considerably_Disagreeable: When I go to match the word in the alphabet it matches in the order of cddeox the word is dcodex, I retrieve the shifted index from that codex, which is fgghra, I want to re arrange the encryption to be like, gfrgha  
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because d is g
 Considerably_Disagreeable: c is f
 Considerably_Disagreeable: o is r and so on
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its a trippy question
 Wontonimo: okay so there are 3 parts, the alphabet, the message, and the word
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ok
 Wontonimo: the objective is to find the A and B that decodes the message such that the word is in the message
 5922: In other words, the word is in plaintext.
 Wontonimo: yes, the word is plaintext and already decoded
 Considerably_Disagreeable: no
 Wontonimo: yes
 Considerably_Disagreeable: how so
 Considerably_Disagreeable: the letters are shifted
 5922: You need to find the key whereby when using it to decode the message, that word is present.
 Thorcode: don't try to solve won codebreaker, it is like hard like the  resit
 Thorcode: or harder
 Wontonimo: for the first one, A=8, B=0.
 Thorcode: the resit I could know it use moorse
 Thorcode: but this...............
 Wontonimo: now, put the message "IFMMPAXPSME" though the encryption 
 Wontonimo: and you will get "HELLO_WORLD"
 Wontonimo: which contains "WORLD"
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if the letters are shifted right?
 5922: You think this is harder than The Resistance? D:
 Wontonimo: haha
 Considerably_Disagreeable: im not unshifting the letters i am simply re arranging the shifted letters, the letters are still shifted to what ever they got shifted to, u would still have to shift back to decrypt
 Wontonimo: sorry, A=-7
 Wontonimo: anyway
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: this could harder than the resistance
 5922: Did you solve Caesar is Chief?
 Thorcode: nah
 5922: ..
 Wontonimo: try decrypting the message using a variety of ceasar ciphers.
 Wontonimo: that will pass the first 4 test cases
 Considerably_Disagreeable: bro
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i know how to decrypt it
 Wontonimo: ok
 Considerably_Disagreeable: thats not the question
 Wontonimo: what's the question?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31b8ea25-ca8a-48cc-b169-ea424c03d8a9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31b8ea25-ca8a-48cc-b169-ea424c03d8a9</a>
 5922: Oh, my. Would it be worthwhile to direct people to Caesar is the Chief first in the prompt?
 BartholomewIII: Probably
 Wontonimo: i just programmed it without looking at my solution.  it's 9 lines of code.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: the puzzle or my question
 Considerably_Disagreeable: two different things
 Wontonimo: the puzzle
 Considerably_Disagreeable: exactly
 Wontonimo: i don't even understand your question
 Considerably_Disagreeable: how when i tell you what order you have to rearrange them in
 5922: It is a shift which is then multiplied
 5922: it isn't rearranged
 5922: At least not in the sense that I gather
 5922: You can solve it through brute-force replication of the process that you would use to create the message just by going through the values and using the given equation
 5922: As Wontonimo suggested above
 Considerably_Disagreeable: the question, literally had nothing to do with the puzzle. stop talking about the puzzle. Its not about the puzzle
 Considerably_Disagreeable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/defb0526-ff31-4e8c-93f2-118ec00f78dd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/defb0526-ff31-4e8c-93f2-118ec00f78dd</a>
 Wontonimo: ah.  sorry, can't help you then
 5922: Boy, you are disagreeable.
 5922: D;
 Dren: we are talking about the puzzle because that is a common grounds of information
 Dren: the question in your pastebin doesn't mean anything to anyone other than you since there are infinite ways to get those letter configurations
 Wontonimo: What puzzle is this - me"Code Breaker Puzzle, I am encrypting a message to see how the algo works" - Considerably_Disagreeable
 Wontonimo: anyway... how's it going 5922&#160;?
 Dren: how does pastebin work btw
 Dren: for the chat
 Wontonimo: you just type a bunch of stuff here ... and the system makes a judjement call if it should instead make a pastebin link
 Dren: oh I see
 Dren: that's neat
 Wontonimo: if you paste a lot or it is mostly code, then it will convert it for you
 Wontonimo: doesn't work in private chat
 Wontonimo: but it does work in #channels like #clash and #yomamma

 Dren: oh you're right
 Dren: thank you
 Dren: I've been looking through the forum and the getting help page
 Dren: but I couldn't find it
 Wontonimo: ah, so, now you've invoked a rule.  Don't paste solution&#160;!
 Wontonimo: Dren , so basically, you can post and help with small parts of a puzzle
 Wontonimo: but not whole solution
 Wontonimo: you can also share strategies (without code) and heuristics 
 Thorcode: how the hell dren solve it ez
 Dren: Oh I am sorry
 Thorcode: I took me about more than 2 months
 Dren: well it would've taken me longer if we didn't talk so much about it in the chat before
 Dren: it's easy to go down paths that don't lead anywhere
 Thorcode: ah nice

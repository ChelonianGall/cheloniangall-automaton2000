 Astrobytes: Good morning
 Uljahn: :cat:
 jrke: good morning to you astrobytes
 DomiKo: hiiii
 Astrobytes: DomiKo - UTTT Legend yet?
 DomiKo: ohh yes :D
 jacek: :tada:
 r-o-g-e-r: good morning
 DomiKo: reached it 3:26...
 Astrobytes: :tada:&#160;::rocket:
 DomiKo: reached it at 3:26...
 Astrobytes: Nice one!
 DomiKo: thank you 
 jacek: top 100?
 DomiKo: but there is a lot to improve
 DomiKo: not yet
 DomiKo: 136&#160;:(
 DomiKo: but now 
 DomiKo: i have to make teccles heurictic stronger
 DomiKo: because players in gold didnt use that
 DomiKo: but in legened they use
 WINWINWIN: Nicely done DomiKo
 WINWINWIN: teccles heuristic?
 DomiKo: MSmits told me
 DomiKo: about it
 DomiKo: "play the move that forces your opponent to play in the same miniboard you are playing in "
 WINWINWIN: Ohh teccles is a CG user&#160;:) thought that it was a technical term
 DomiKo: yea :D
 Astrobytes: Not just CG, Halite
 Astrobytes: Before it was on Kaggle
 WINWINWIN: Halite was on another website?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. teccles won it
 DomiKo: hmmm i didn't know about Kaggle 
 WINWINWIN: Wow...
 DomiKo: that site stounds fun
 DomiKo: sounds*
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) so forcing the opponent to play on your miniboard. Why exactly does that work?
 DomiKo: its like when you have empty board
 DomiKo: lets say you have to make a move in top left corner
 DomiKo: and that board is empty
 DomiKo: so do not calculate all move
 DomiKo: and just make move in top left corver
 WINWINWIN: Ok, it moves you directly to legend?
 WINWINWIN: Any forum/techio post on it?
 Astrobytes: No, it's not quite a -3vel&#160;;)
 WINWINWIN: :D
 DomiKo: pushing to legend
 DomiKo: was a battle with top 3 guys
 DomiKo: boss had 34 point
 DomiKo: and second guy had 32...
 DomiKo: so gap was really huge
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) Im in bottom gold.&#160;:(
 DomiKo: from bottom to top
 DomiKo: you need to make SPEEDD
 WINWINWIN: :D
 DomiKo: that's what matter the most
 WINWINWIN: Have been working on a MCTS for about a week now. But I get pretty annoyed while writing an evalutation function...
 DomiKo: i dont know if you could reach that lvl of speed with python
 struct: eval? what game?
 DomiKo: UTTT
 jacek: mcts doesnt need eval
 WINWINWIN: UTTT
 WINWINWIN: Right now Minimax
 DomiKo: ohhh
 WINWINWIN: MCTS is nothing but frustrating dead ends. Im trying to get top 100 gold with a minimax
 DomiKo: my previous solution
 DomiKo: like from 1 year ago
 DomiKo: reach like 150 in gold
 WINWINWIN: minimax?
 DomiKo: and that was minmax
 DomiKo: but i know
 DomiKo: that i optimized it a lot
 jacek: what would be good eval for minimax?
 DomiKo: idk
 jacek: uttt is so unevaluable
 DomiKo: yap
 DomiKo: i eval it like a normal TTT game
 dbdr: how do you eval TTT?
 DomiKo: like shi....
 dbdr: it's so shallow you can just go to terminal nodes, so eval is just WLD&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 DomiKo: i make some patterns
 DomiKo: that could make me win
 DomiKo: and if i see pattern i give points
 DomiKo: that was pretty good in bottom/mid gold
 struct: well 1 ms mcts is enough to get bottom gold
 WINWINWIN: Really? 
 DomiKo: that could be true...
 DomiKo: the gap
 DomiKo: bettween top10 gold and resst
 DomiKo: is soooo big
 struct: depends on the perforamnce
 struct: im sure that &lt;500 rollouts are more than enough for bottom gold
 DomiKo: yesterday i had like 90% winrate with all player &lt; top 10
 DomiKo: and like 50% in top10
 Astrobytes: acat got gold with just MC iirc
 DomiKo: he did it in java
 Astrobytes: yeah&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Who is the gold boss?
 DomiKo: i know that he really don't like c++&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: He should have used Lua :P
 DomiKo: yea&#160;;)
 MSmits: DomiKo, the reason that top gold is so much better than the rest of gold is that they're people that fought hard to get into legend and failed. 
 MSmits: the rest probably stopped soon after reaching gold
 DomiKo: yea i guess
 DomiKo: and thank you man 
 DomiKo: without you i woudn't reach legend &lt;3
 jacek: i though relu was shit, it didnt work with my xor example
 MSmits: DomiKo np
 struct: relu?
 MSmits: activation function
 MSmits: used for nn
 jacek: then i changed the drelu from if x &lt; 0 to x&lt;= 0 and it worked!
 jacek: but most sources talk about &lt;
 MSmits: maybe it depends on your implementation
 jacek: or was it &gt; 0? :thinking:
 MSmits: if it was &gt; 0 then that would make sense
 MSmits: thats one negation away from your version
 MSmits: btw, on Oware, do you currently have an opening book&#160;?
 MSmits: I saw you submitted a new versin
 MSmits: version
 MSmits: it does a weird 2nd move
 jacek: i ditched opening book
 MSmits: ah
 jacek: which 2nd move
 MSmits: the first p2 move
 MSmits: you choose 4th pit
 MSmits: noone else does
 MSmits: doesnt mean it's bad
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: my meta mcts started out thinking that was the best move
 MSmits: but it's now at 5
 MSmits: which is what my live bot uses and Agade as well
 jacek: well my deeper search also says its 5-&gt;11-&gt;
 struct: best move is d3
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: are you hinting that i should get back to Othello struct?
 jacek: back?
 MSmits: well i have coded a bit
 MSmits: no working version yet
 struct: It's your choice
 struct: I don't want to force you
 MSmits: mmh sure you do :P
 MSmits: but its cool, i like the game
 MSmits: not sure how the search will go, this one might not go as well as others I fear
 MSmits: eval is difficult
 struct: You might need to learn new stuff
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: Which is a good thing
 MSmits: I guess so, yes
 jacek: my book was based on old eval and was unneseccarily big
 jacek: and i dont have size for both book and weights
 MSmits: what do you mean unnecessarily big? Too many moves?
 MSmits: but isn't the book negligibly small? Mine always are
 MSmits: I never made a book over 10 kb so far
 MSmits: and thats without unicode compression
 MSmits: I can probably make it 5x smaller, to 2kb max
 jacek: well i had i.e. positions with only 1 legal moves
 MSmits: maybe because my books are partially handcrafted. I only allow automated additions after 10k games played or so
 MSmits: from that position
 MSmits: thats about 5 hrs of meta mcts time 
 MSmits: for 1 move
 struct: we need to fund MSmits reasearch
 MSmits: lol, nah, i like it slow, means i can adjust whats going on if weird stuff happens
 Astrobytes: In exchange for what? Smitsishares?&#160;:)
 MSmits: jacek, btw, do you put whole board positions in your book?
 Astrobytes: Or is it like kickstarter, we get a free opening book at every 10K goal
 MSmits: like, the entire board state + a move?
 MSmits: because that is horribly inefficient
 jacek: i know
 MSmits:  { 5 { 5 } }
 struct: isnt it best to keep track of current legal pages?
 MSmits: this is my current oware book
 MSmits: first player plays 5, second responds with 5
 MSmits: there is no game state
 jacek: and thats 10kb?
 MSmits: no, thats my oware book
 struct: so you have like {5{5{next{...}}}}
 struct:&#160;?
 MSmits: yavalath is 8kb with somewhere around 1k moves or so?
 MSmits: struct yeah
 MSmits: say the opponent sometimes uses 4, it would be
 jacek: how does meta mcts works for mcts w/ 0depth ept?
 MSmits:  { 5 { 5 } 4 { 2} }
 MSmits: the first one is always the one *I* would pick
 MSmits: the others are opponent replies with counters
 jacek: do you use win/loss for the backpropagation as usual for meta then?
 MSmits: for oware its more complicated, but yeah i would normally just back prop win/loss/draw
 MSmits: for oware i backprop seeds
 MSmits: I play a game to 15 seeds on board
 MSmits: finish with end game databse
 MSmits: and back prop the net score
 MSmits: p1 - p2
 MSmits: i do this because then i can do transpositions and disregard the current score
 MSmits: so only the board state and the game turn matter, not the score
 MSmits: the objective is to get maximum seeds
 MSmits: from the current board state
 MSmits: for this you dont need to know about past captures
 MSmits: this is really bug-prone though, because when you backpropagate, you *do* need to take into account captures
 MSmits: at ply 10, captures before 10 dont matter, but captures after 10 do
 RaduAntonache89: is there a place to practice answering interview questions on this site? I just finished a test received from an employer and I was wondering if there are practice tests
 RaduAntonache89: or does the employer provide his own questions and the site simply provides the delivery method?
 Uljahn: try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>
 Uljahn: also not sure about interview questions but you can practice by solving puzzles
 [CG]Thibaud: RaduAntonache89to practice interview questions, best is to do easy and medium puzzles here.Also, on CG for Work, we provide a library of test questions but the employer can add custom ones.
 Tahini245: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 RaduAntonache89: ok, thanks
 jacek: i will treasure this moment <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476480167">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476480167</a>
 DomiKo: good job
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 MSmits: however, you beat me several times in recent submits and my bot beats re curse 60% :P
 MSmits: maybe if I submit spam I could rank you above him 
 jacek: oh, and i even how 1 win against agad
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: I draw almost half of games vs him no idea why
 MSmits: with 48 seeds, getting half the seeds would seem to be more of a rare occurence
 dbdr: maybe oware is a draw?
 MSmits: probably. Awari is a draw for sure
 MSmits: it is solved as draw when player 1 chooses the rightmost pit
 struct: Othello might be a draw too
 MSmits: any other pit and p2 wins
 MSmits: people seem to think it is
 MSmits: ah right, i need to get back to that :P
 Hjax: yeah come beat us up at othello
 MSmits: will try, but might be a week or two before i have a good bot. Going on short vacation soon
 MSmits: I suppose I could code a bit while there :P
 Washier: nobody should wait to code
 MSmits: agreed
 Hjax: so im looking at TD learning, and im wondering why you update after each turn to try to approximate the next turns eval rather than waiting until the end of the game and using the game result to update all moves made in that game 
 jacek: i was wondering too. but surprisingly it works
 jacek: of course at first episode only final position and prefinal position werights will be updated
 jacek: but doing more and more episodes, earlier and earlier weights will be updated
 jacek: the other spectrum is Monte Carlo, waiting to finish
 Hjax: im also trying to work out how many weights i can fit into the upload limit 
 Hjax: i suppose it depends on how granular i want my weights to be 
 Hjax: jacek did you search while training? or just pick the child that maximizes eval 
 Hjax: you said you ran a lot of training games right? how long did it take 
 dbdr: TD works because many things affect the final result
 dbdr: if you affect it too much to early moves, there is a lot of noise
 dbdr: if your moves in between are not optimal
 dbdr: (which they are not, otherwise no need to learn&#160;;) )
 jacek: Hjax in TD i use child with max eval or 10% random
 jacek: TD phase of few hundred thousands games takes about 30 minutes
 jacek: every 100k i tested the eval during real fast matches against older candidate eval. if 55% win of 300 games, the new eval becomes new  candidate
 Hjax: i see 
 Hjax: how do you fit so many weights in your upload? 
 Hjax: are you just using really small (byte) weights? 
 jacek: 1 byte per weight
 jacek: well actually 2 because im using hex and didnt bother with unicode yet
 Washier: wow, trying to improve my othello bot is hard and confusing. try something new that seems to work locally and in the IDE, get murdered in the submit, but somehow beat tomatoes once :confused:
 MSmits: maybe pm tomatoes to tell him he has a bug :P
 struct: maybe he doesnt have binary version on ide
 struct: and you are playing vs rust debug
 Washier: wasnt a timeout, i took all 4 corners and smashed it. weird
 MSmits: you know whats funny. If tomatoes' bot is completely deterministic, you can record the game and check for this series of moves and use it to always win :P
 Washier: jeepers. 
 MSmits: :smiling_imp:
 MSmits: it probably isnt though
 Washier: its not deterministic though. i've lost like a 1000 games agains tomatoes
 MSmits: that doesnt mean it isnt deterministic
 jacek: youre destined to lose against him
 Washier: haha
 struct: Im gonna make anti tomatoes boss
 MSmits: that can also mean you are not deterministic
 Washier: i am
 jacek: cucumber boss?
 Washier: haha, or chef knife boss
 MSmits: you always make the same moves in  every game given the same gamestate?
 struct: bug boss
 Washier: yes, just plain minimax alpha-beta with a deterministic eval function
 jacek: to be frank there are 3 unique stats after 2 moves
 jacek: states
 Washier: with symetry?
 MSmits: washier, your search stops when calculation time is up and the CPU is not always equally fast
 MSmits: so its not deterministic in every game
 tomatoes: only 1st black move randomized
 MSmits: yes but the calculation time difference between game gives you randomness anyway
 MSmits: actually time is the same, number of cpu cycles varies
 Washier: i dont time anything. i build the tree 5 deep or bust
 MSmits: oh then you are completely deterministic yeah
 Washier: always living on the edge
 MSmits: why not just keep searching till time ends?
 jacek: what if 2 moves have the same score?
 MSmits: you might get deeper
 Washier: i choose the first if two with same score
 jacek: apparently iterative deepening is voodoo magic
 Washier: yes, just lazy
 MSmits: its easy to code
 MSmits: just add a loop 
 MSmits: and a breaker with time check
 jacek: people always say its a waste of time
 Washier: iterative deepening is what i should do yes. but dont the scores need to propogate back up after each breadth search, that still stumps me
 MSmits: jacek what time is wasted?
 MSmits: Washier nothing has to backpropagate between iterations
 MSmits: you're just doing the same search multiple times, only deeper
 jacek: well instead of ab(5) you do ab(1) ab(2) ab(3) etc.
 jacek: people cant grasp the concept ab(n-1) is tiny in comparison to ab(n)
 MSmits: yeah, but they're wrong because ab(5) is like 5x longer than 1 - 4 together
 MSmits: right
 eulerscheZahl: jacek i think you have to leave a :thumbsup: on discord
 jacek:&#160;?
 struct: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: just do it
 Washier: jacek, i def grasp that. ok, i'll put a loop around that puppy and go for it.
 MSmits: btw, might be you will still get 5 deep, but maybe on  end games get 9 deep or something because less moves
 Washier: from 11 moves left i search the whole tree, basically sovle it.
 MSmits: right, but maybe you can do it from 12
 MSmits: in some cases
 jacek: eulerscheZahl but i dun wanna
 CDRToast: Good morning/ Day to all
 Washier: ok yes, with i deepening i can improve move order and eliminate  some moves completely?
 struct: hi CDRToast
 MSmits: you can do this yes
 MSmits: you can store information from your previous search in some kind of array/table thing
 MSmits: then prefer searching the best move first
 MSmits: or at least the move your search thought was best
 Washier: thats another thing that bothers me in othello, do TT's make sense at all? its not like chess\checkers with recurring states.
 MSmits: you dont have to have recurring states
 MSmits: you can also arrive to the same state by different routes
 Washier: ah ok
 MSmits: this is most easy to see in those games where you slowly fill up the board like in TTT
 MSmits: TTT has no recurring states either
 MSmits: but it does have many different ways to get to the same state
 MSmits: btw if you've never done a transposition table, think about this
 MSmits: its easy to do AB
 MSmits: its easy to do TT
 MSmits: not easy to do both
 MSmits: you need to record the AB status into the TT
 jacek: well in AB you have to be careful about lower and upper bound
 MSmits: yeah and its really hard to wrap your head around
 MSmits: unless you just take someone elses code and dont look at it again
 Washier: have read about those bounds as part of the TT yes,
 MSmits: i didnt know about this before and I coded a so-called perfectly playing TTT bot, that somehow sometimes made mistakes
 MSmits: turned out this was the issue
 jacek: does anyone use cg spunk in chrome? i run batch run and never ends and when i stopped it says stopping and nothing happens
 dbdr: isn't cgspunk dead for years?
 struct: ^
 struct: try cgbenchmark I guess
 jacek: whats the alternative
 dbdr: cgbenchmark
 dbdr: or write your own&#160;:)
 jacek: ah that requires username/password but im using gmail auth for that
 struct: delete
 tomatoes: try password recover
 Hjax: is there a rule against making a second account
 Hjax: cgbenchmark doesnt submit anything 
 Washier: must be
 Hjax: but i guess you wouldnt be able to test in higher leagues
 RoboStac: you can only test against the boss until you've submitted once
 RoboStac: so you'd not be able to do that for contests
 Hjax: oh robo, random question, how big is your neural network? 
 Hjax: cant be super big if you want it to eval fast on cpu 
 RoboStac: 128 inputs -&gt; 3 3x3Convolution layers of 8 filters each -&gt; 3x3Convolution with 4 filters -&gt; Dense with 64+1 outputs
 Hjax: how many nodes can you search per move? 
 RoboStac: I average around 8000
 Hjax: do you think thats why you arent able to beat dbd r? not enough time to search deeply? 
 Hjax: or do you think you can improve your current network more?
 RoboStac: I've given up on that one as I doubled the amount of training games with no real improvements
 RoboStac: trying a bigger network now
 Hjax: oh youre going in the opposite direction 
 Hjax: even more knowledge with even fewer nodes?
 RoboStac: my original one only had 3 conv layers instead of 4 and didn't get as far, so I feel like bigger might be better here
 Hjax: when will the new net be ready?&#160;:)
 RoboStac: last one was pretty much done after about 100k games and I'm only up to 25k so far 
 RoboStac: though it's already looking better
 jacek: bigger net, slower?
 RoboStac: yeah
 RoboStac: both in time to play games and in theory in how long it takes to train
 Washier: if this was kaggle, also bigger chance to overfit&#160;:)
 jacek: meh, i still need to grasp the concept of training policy, not only value
 Hjax: is training just value and using UCT1 a lot worse than policy + value + PUCT? 
 Hjax: i dont think ive ever seen a paper directly compare the two approaches 
 RoboStac: yeah, due to the low number of playouts the policy is fairly important
 RoboStac: even with so few playouts I tend to solve games around the same time as others most of the time (with some exceptions as you've spotted before&#160;:))
 Washier: how far from the end can the top bots solve games?
 Hjax: 15 moves from the end roughly? 
 Hjax: thats when tric tends to say win or loss at least
 Washier: jeepers
 Hjax: my bot doesnt have solver yet 
 jacek: i mostly solve 11-12 before
 Hjax: but usually im within 1% of win/loss by 10 moves before 
 Washier: wow. me too, yet i suck way more
 Washier: so i lose way before 11 moves are left. 
 Hjax: yeah but you said you only search depth 5 before the end game right?
 Washier: yes
 Washier: figures
 Hjax: im not sure how deep my search tree is with my mcts
 Hjax: but its definitely much deeper than 5 
 jacek: i read about special endgame solvers
 Washier: yes, so far i've been really lazy with that. way too much attention on eval. lot of work to look forward to&#160;:) really love Othello
 Hjax: opposite of me Washier
 Hjax: my bot is all search, no eval 
 jacek: you hate othello?
 Hjax: har har :P 
 jacek: ahh
 Washier: haha
 Hjax: my only eval term is mobility 
 Washier: so tight around 10th spot on the leadbaord now. a lot of luck, unless i missed new submits
 Washier: do you sort moves by the mobility?
 Hjax: no
 Hjax: i just assume whoever has more moves is winning in my search 
 Washier: so you dont play all games to the end?
 jacek: no corners at least/
 Hjax: i only play 6 random moves, and take mobility after
 Washier: at each level
 Hjax: no at the end of the 6 random moves
 Hjax: every thing ive tried, including corners, has made it worse 
 Washier: ok, ty. yes, can confirm, mobility is the driver in my eval.
 Washier: pirce count, meh.
 Washier: *piece
 Dreamlxy: hi
 Hjax: having fewer pieces than your opponent is better in the early game
 Dreamlxy: 有中国人么
 Washier: i've read that yes. cant make it work though.
 Washier: (trying different eval functions in diffrent stages of the game now)
 Kagome: 没有中国人
 jacek: meow?
 Kagome: woof
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: sugoi desu ne?
 Automaton2000: i haven't even started yet
 bel3atar: wtf?
 Washier: haha
 Washier: &lt;sound a sloth makes&gt;
 AbundantPuddle: What does the sloth say?
 Washier: wazaaap. but softly
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 Washier: jacek, MRSmith, Hjax thanks. Just got my first promising result with iterative deepening. amazing how much more relevant you can make the search in the same amount of time. 
 Washier: also move ordering rocks
 Hjax: :D
 Washier: just love that feeling you get when AI surprises you. It is like magic
 Hjax: submitting a new version soon?
 Washier: tired, and honestly had a bottle of wine in the process. maybe later.
 Hjax: oooh robo won a game against dbd r 
 Washier: wow
 jacek: :scream:
 RoboStac: so it turns out bigger is better&#160;:)
 jacek: thats what she...
 Washier: haha
 eulerscheZahl: now i see why you refused the moderator thing :D
 Astrobytes: Was WIN WIN WIN that nominated jacek, I said at the time I wasn't sure... 
 eulerscheZahl: the advantage of WIN*3: different timezone

 jacek: why would anyone nominate me ~
 eulerscheZahl: you could nominate people?
 Astrobytes: Nah, Thibaud was asking the other morning
 Hjax: and its not even done being trained yet right?

 eulerscheZahl: was that the doctor phonecall that made you go afk? got the results now?
 AbundantPuddle: Is there a way to report or open a case about a clash? Because unless I am missing something, this is obviously wrong.
 eulerscheZahl: which clash?
 jacek: what wrong
 Astrobytes: No, work related eulerscheZahl.Yeah, I have a vitamin D deficiency but it doesn't explain everything. And I can't get a bone density scan for a while because hospital isn't taking anyone for now. Speaking to my own doctor next week (spoke to different one today)
 eulerscheZahl: you can give feedback after the clash. but tbh i'm not sure if anyone will read it

 eulerscheZahl: right
 AbundantPuddle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/77c4fb53-4c0a-4e7f-bbec-938fc407c2af">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/77c4fb53-4c0a-4e7f-bbec-938fc407c2af</a>

 eulerscheZahl: i can confirm the m
 AbundantPuddle: So it's basically asking the average of the ascii codes then? Not the average of the length?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know what your understanding of it means
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; s[len(s)//2]'j'
 AbundantPuddle: Yes, that is what I got
 Hjax: i got a reverse puzzle once that was the sum of the ascii values of a string 
 Hjax: and i just didnt get it 
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; s = <i>.join(sorted(s))</i>&gt;&gt;&gt; s[len(s)//2]'l'
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/485d6ab4acfe2984f3ccafdacfceea5daf6">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/485d6ab4acfe2984f3ccafdacfceea5daf6</a>such original, much creative
 AbundantPuddle: It didn't say anything about sorting or ordered. It just asked for the average, which I took to mean the middle letter.
 eulerscheZahl: and only with odd chars <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2188188421514700e6c7657a7fe293539ad">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2188188421514700e6c7657a7fe293539ad</a>
 Hjax: yeah, and without knowing how common those puzzles are, its just crappy to try to reverse 
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 AbundantPuddle: I appreciate you taking a look and explaining it to me. It was just my misunderstanding of the requirements. I do feel it could still be explained better though.
 Uljahn: if there are bots playing CoCs, there should be bots for making CoC contributions and approving them :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like a simple task
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: automate joining in 50 clashes to get moderation rights there
 eulerscheZahl: that's the nasty part, as it has captchas
 eulerscheZahl: the rest is simple
 AbundantPuddle: Bots writing bots. What can go wrong?
 Uljahn: singularity is close, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah i had to learn it though
 Astrobytes: AbundantPuddle also props to you for not instantly going to the forum/discord and claiming there's a bug in the puzzle&#160;:+1:
 AbundantPuddle: I'm gonna miss the good old days.What good old days?When people were killed by other people.
 Astrobytes: Always good to check in chat first
 eulerscheZahl: yeah. the chat is faster in replies and triggers less users to look into it
 AbundantPuddle: I generally believe in the approval process and trust that items that make it through have been tested thoroughly by people much more intelligent than me. I just didn't understand how something (that seemed) so obviously wrong would have made it through.
 Uljahn: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: and it's one of the older contributions, sitting there for years
 eulerscheZahl: reasonable thinking that it might be you and not the puzzle then
 eulerscheZahl: we have that at least once a week: this puzzle was solved by 100k users. but there must be a bug in it, my code is correct
 Astrobytes: lol, we need a PEBCAC bot for those.Yeah, most of the problematic ones are fairly recent, not much to worry about with the older ones.
 eulerscheZahl: i keep forgetting what that acronym stands for
 Astrobytes: Problem Exists Between Computer And Chair
 eulerscheZahl: i just remembered it now :D
 eulerscheZahl: partially, didn't get the E
 Astrobytes: Lots of variations on it too
 Schwase: euler your comment about needing a dictionary for hooch clash made me chuckle
 eulerscheZahl: problems of non-native speakershad no idea what an "orb" is
 Astrobytes: that's a classic JBM statement that one right?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the one he's remembered best for
 AbundantPuddle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4789be4d-e53d-4b82-a137-5ca01ff001c0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4789be4d-e53d-4b82-a137-5ca01ff001c0</a>
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao. Love that acronym.
 eulerscheZahl: timestamp of your clash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/75804c05-fa5f-464c-96fc-3f2e6779d7c3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/75804c05-fa5f-464c-96fc-3f2e6779d7c3</a>
 Schwase: is JBM still active?
 Astrobytes: Yeah sure
 Schwase: i have 5 easy practice challenges left to 100% easy and 3 of them are made by him lol
 eulerscheZahl: at some point i had 100% for everything but very hard
 eulerscheZahl: then community contributions got merged
 Schwase: its just that the content of his puzzles is very creative and unfamiliar to me
 Schwase: like smooth! what kind of game is that
 eulerscheZahl: for me some puzzles are interesting and fun to solve
 eulerscheZahl: for others i get the hell out of there
 Schwase: im determined haha
 Schwase: kinda surprised by a pathfinding puzzle in easy ngl
 Schwase: most of them i can solve just within the main
 Schwase: using pattern recognition etc
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the lost child got approved
 Schwase: yeah
 Schwase: bout a week ago i think
 Astrobytes: Yes unfortunately.
 Astrobytes: I mean, it's fine but there's nothing to distinguish it from the other pathfinding puzzles.
 eulerscheZahl: that's one of those puzzles i don't care about. maybe because i can code pathfinding without much thinking now
 Schwase: someone complained about the wording of it but like come on its simple pathfinding you dont need some great story for that kind of thing
 eulerscheZahl: i miss the extra twist to get into it
 Hjax: im not high enough level to approve contributions, i should do more puzzles
 Astrobytes: Yep. AFAIK he'd planned to do something else but it got approved first
 eulerscheZahl: The 12 year old child has lost is[sic!] mother
 eulerscheZahl: obviously we can complain about the working here
 Astrobytes: the working eh
 eulerscheZahl: fail
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: A somewhat epic one at that
 eulerscheZahl: but seriously: don't put your contribution as pending when you aren't done
 Astrobytes: Yep, agreed.
 Astrobytes: WIP is there for a reason
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me that i wanted to fix 2 or 3 grammar mistakes in the onitama statement :innocent:
 Astrobytes: "player select(s)", "will th(e)n (be)", "exchanging it"
 Astrobytes: Anything else I missed?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe constantly addressing the player with "he" but meh
 AbundantPuddle: layerpay elect(s)say illway enthay ebay
 jacek: " The opponent on that cell will than get eliminated from the game"&#160;!!!!!!!
 Astrobytes: Yeah I got that one
 Astrobytes: You should all talk proper England like I does
 jacek: karliso fix ur bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476535370">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476535370</a>
 eulerscheZahl: jacek fix ur message
 jacek: how can you tell im not using book?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just assuming
 jacek: and youre right :o
 struct: error fixed by doing nothing&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: BenjaminUrquhart where is my shrine sprite? :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: and what error did you fix struct?
 struct: javascript
 eulerscheZahl: pixi?
 struct: yes
 jacek: one cant fix javascript
 struct: I was accessing container before entities were drawn
 struct: or added
 struct: dont know how its possible
 Washier: i feel like i should close this window. not my business&#160;:)
 struct: ok happened again
 struct: so its not fixe
 eulerscheZahl: loud neighbors Washier?
 Washier: interesting neighbours. and me being a looky look
 Washier: just walking down the street really
 PkZ: Does anyone know if A* is generally expected to succeed?
 Astrobytes: Just closed mine, the Lord of Barkness/Doggie Barko got let out again
 eulerscheZahl: if there is a way, A* will find it
 eulerscheZahl: not necessarily the shortest path
 PkZ: yeah but what if there is no way?
 Washier: noob here. A* is sweet
 PkZ: mine just goes in circles forever
 eulerscheZahl: also depending on how good your heuristic function is
 eulerscheZahl: you have a closed list to only visit each node once
 Washier: even fast in C#
 Hjax: if theres a path, A* will find it 
 Hjax: oh scroll 
 Astrobytes: So if you're going in circles then you have a bug
 eulerscheZahl: at least we agree Hjax. almost word by word :D
 Hjax: :D
 Astrobytes: He's already started typing my thoughts before me euler
 Hjax: have i?
 Astrobytes: It's all downhill for me now
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Washier: haha
 eulerscheZahl: damn. i knew that you are slow Astrobytes. but that slow? :rofl:
 Astrobytes: You beat me to it yesterday, and the other day as well
 PkZ: My good old source wikipedia doesnt have a closed list :thinking:
 Astrobytes: :grimacing:
 PkZ: guess i should implement that
 Washier: github

 Astrobytes: The German for algorith is 'algorithmus'. How very grand sounding&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *algorithm
 Washier: algoritme

 Washier: so is euler monitoring struct fixing code here?
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 eulerscheZahl: struct and me are just building a little game
 Washier: aah
 eulerscheZahl: me: enginestruct: engine again in JS for smaller replays
 Astrobytes: nice. Well, not nice for poor struct
 Washier: picked it up because it hade the same patterns as my work chats
 jacek: so struc took dirty job making javascript
 Washier: fail. no. haha
 struct: yes with poor documentationn
 Washier: you can doo eeet
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, i'll return him without permanent mental damage when i'm done
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and when struct becomes a mod, he can't even delete his account anymore
 eulerscheZahl: not without losing mod status
 Washier: he made othello, so im partial
 Washier: but what do i know
 Astrobytes: Washier, struct made an oath to get legend in one night for a contest or he would delete his account.
 Astrobytes: He deleted it.
 Washier: holy sheet
 eulerscheZahl: that's how the Yavalath game ended up being by Undefined
 Astrobytes: Yep. It's now canon.
 Hjax: he picked a horrible game to try to get legend in quickly 
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah
 eulerscheZahl: he tried for longer, just without submitting
 Washier: &lt;popcorn&gt;
 Hjax: utg was so meta game focused 
 Astrobytes: true
 Hjax: you really had to submit 
 eulerscheZahl: on saturday i said "no sleep till legend"
 eulerscheZahl: turned into "no wakeup without legend", got pushed over night
 Astrobytes: lol
 Washier: what i like is that it is hard. takes a lot of work. 
 Washier: have not made legend of course
 struct: Seems like the constructor is not called at all
 struct: But how can this happen 50% of the time
 Washier: oh boy
 struct: anyone knows a good way to debug javascript?
 struct: My current method is console.error()
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: I think A* is optimal
 dbdr: i.e. finds the optimal path
 Hjax: the first path A* finds isnt necessarily optimal though 
 Hjax: if you let it run long enough it will find the optimal path 
 dbdr: not if your heuristic is admissible
 Hjax: which it doesnt have to be for A* to work 
 JBM: Schwase: yeah, still around
 dbdr: depends how you define "work"&#160;;)
 Hjax: it will find a path :D
 dbdr: AFAIK the way it's designed is to be used with an admissible heuri, and then it does find the optimal path
 dbdr: but you can use it in other ways if you want
 eulerscheZahl: heuristic can be hard depending on your problem
 eulerscheZahl: on grid based boards such as on CG you can use pythagorean distance, should do well
 eulerscheZahl: but thinking bigger: navigation from Paris to Moscow
 eulerscheZahl: you can't track every small road, so you navigate to the highway as fast as possible
 dbdr: that's why it's a heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: that's a reasonable heuristic. but not necessarily the shortest or fastest
 JBM: i'll go with "probably the fastest tho"
 eulerscheZahl: exactly. but A* relies on it, so it can fail when the heuristic fails
 dbdr: you could take a straight line at motorway speed
 dbdr: that should be admissible
 dbdr: and still reasonably good
 eulerscheZahl: but not necessarily perfect. that's my point
 dbdr: perfect in what sense?
 eulerscheZahl: whatever your target function is
 eulerscheZahl: speed, distance, fuel, ...
 dbdr: no
 dbdr: you will get the optimal
 dbdr: unless you can find shorter than the straight line&#160;;)
 dbdr: at max speed
 eulerscheZahl: A* is optimal, if your heuristic doesn't give you a higher cost than the actual
 dbdr: exactly
 Washier: yes. admisable
 struct: Seems fixed
 Astrobytes: Famous last words...
 struct: Might be 100% fixed
 struct: before I couldnt even change from SD-HD
 struct: now its possible without breaking
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 Cappefra: hi everyone
 Astrobytes: Hi
 MSmits: yay my first othello gamr
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476543500">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476543500</a>
 MSmits: generate move works and i am just selecting the first one
 MSmits: cuz why not
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 jacek: the game provides possible moves, how can we trust what youre saying
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I'm me, thats how
 MSmits: I can't even keep things to myself I shouldn't be sharing
 dbdr: the fastest dumb bot around&#160;;)
 MSmits: how would i lie :P
 dbdr: no offense intended
 MSmits: haha yeah
 MSmits: but no AVX yet
 MSmits: could be faster
 MSmits: the "no pass turns" thing is interesting
 MSmits: earlier I was studying the statement to find out how to pass
 struct: Not sure if it was good idea or not
 MSmits: I dont know either
 MSmits: I dont mind it much
 MSmits: so far
 MSmits: it's server friendly though, why give players a turn if they cant do anything
 struct: its more like if you have multiple turns in a row you can search more
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: I will have a pass turn in my tree though
 MSmits: makes so you can more easily alternate when backpropagating and such
 MSmits: Reusing the tree will be challenging, but I can simply activate expert mode
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: but thats pretty low on my todo list, for now i'll just treat every turn as a new game
 struct: Boss has around 40k rollouts
 MSmits: from previous experience, reusing the tree is pretty minor
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: on 2nd turn
 MSmits: i'm not worried about the boss
 MSmits: I'll beat it when i'm done
 MSmits: but good to have  abenchmark
 dbdr: struct, do you want new code for the boss?
 Hjax: are we adding another othello boss?
 dbdr: just making the current one stronger
 struct: Yeah dbdr, we cant let msmits reach wood 1
 dbdr: MSmits needs a challenge
 Hjax: lol
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh crap now comes the sign stuff
 tomatoes: pass moves in tree may skew minimax :thinking:
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I don't minimax though&#160;:)
 struct: What does skew means?
 struct: favours?
 MSmits: unbalances
 struct: unbalances in what way?
 MSmits: may favor one side or the other
 tomatoes: i tried minimax style propagating
 MSmits: if you have only 1 child when you expand, just expand again
 MSmits: not just pass turns
 MSmits: also turns with 1 move
 MSmits: i do this in oware
 MSmits: not in other games
 MSmits: if it almost never happens there's not much point to it
 struct: Here might happen more
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: mmh I got over a million rollouts on turn 1 and then crashed on turn 2 :P
 MSmits: didnt read all the input or something 
 MSmits: oh right, dont put the output statement inside your loop to select best move
 MSmits: ok 1.3 million rollouts on turn 1. 150k rollouts on turn 2. Also it solves the game 9 plies before the end. 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476547699">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476547699</a>
 MSmits: but thats with an eval of 0
 MSmits: should be able to solve much better with an actual eval
 jacek: so typical mcts?
 MSmits: yeah same numbers I get in most games
 jacek: and the bot is 40k rollouts, how can you lose so easily
 MSmits: cuz an eval of 0
 MSmits: every position is worth 0
 jacek: youre doing ept?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well early as in no random rollout
 jacek: x_X
 MSmits: it works well in onitama and oware
 MSmits: dunno about here
 jacek: with eval...
 MSmits: yes of course lol
 MSmits: I just finished my sim and mcts framework. Eval is next&#160;:)
 MSmits: then i need to fix reusing the tree, AVX the move generation and such
 MSmits: I am just happy i didnt get stuck on mcts bugs for hours this time
 MSmits: it's a first
 jacek: yet
 jacek: wait for multiple passes
 RoboStac: if your eval is 0 how can you know your sign swapping is right?&#160;:)
 MSmits: why would it be a problem
 MSmits: the solver sign swapping has to be correct Robo, backpropagation of eval could have a sign error, but thats easy to fix
 MSmits: jacek why would multiple passes be a problem for mcts?
 MSmits: I just add a single child as a pass turn, same board
 RoboStac: it's only a problem for tree reuse
 MSmits: yeah i know
 MSmits: you guys warned me thankfully
 jacek: i bet there is some hidden bug anyway
 MSmits: could be
 MSmits: I took most of my code from my Oware bot, the only annoying part was the fact that I start with a playerID, instead of always being the first player
 MSmits: i was worried about this causing me problems
 MSmits: btw, this way seems more natural to me
 MSmits: Oware is weird for flipping the board on you without telling you
 MSmits: i literally count the number of pits with 4 seeds in them to see which player I am :P
 jacek: i think that was part of the challenge?
 MSmits: it certainly is when you're trying to use an opening and end game book that requires you to know how many turns you have left
 Astrobytes: I appear to have fixed a bug
 MSmits: which game?
 Astrobytes: Othello
 Astrobytes: I still have major issues that were depending on the bug, but that's a job for tomorrow
 MSmits: well good that you fixed it
 MSmits: I am working on eval now
 MSmits: trying to figure out how to incorporate mobility without having to count the number of moves for every child
 Astrobytes: Over-optimising already :D
 MSmits: mmh yeah i guess. It just seems so expensive to run this function for every child
 Astrobytes: mobility just as in available moves or incorporating frontiers?
 MSmits: I got the frontiers thing
 MSmits: so just available moves
 MSmits: I guess the frontier thing is just as expensive
 MSmits: so for now I'll just generate them
 MSmits: optimize later
 Astrobytes: Yeah tbh I really don't think that's particularly expensive
 MSmits: maybe not
 RogerRoger: Is the chat broken on CoC?
 Astrobytes: It's just some popcounts right
 RogerRoger: Once the clash begins the chat closes and never comes back even at the end of the clash
 jacek: yeah, it happens for some time now
 Astrobytes: Hm, has anyone reported that on discord/forum?
 RogerRoger: bummer, that takes some of the fun away
 Astrobytes: It shouldn't happen, it should be available. Not a lot of people use it but it should still work
 Astrobytes: Welp. 11th again in Othello but this time I gained a bunch of points. Bug neutralised. Work shall resume tomorrow
 Astrobytes: Goodnight all, take care
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 FLQ4: gn
 Hexdro: star man share?
 darkhorse64: You are making mince meat of the boss, MSmits
 MSmits: yeah
 awesometj: i need some help
 darkhorse64: I'd hope my creature would resist a bit more
 MSmits: I was expecting it to, knowing the quality of your bots
 MSmits: I'm solving 15 plies before the end of the game
 darkhorse64: There is no solver in the boss and it's only full random rollouts
 MSmits: ahh thats different
 awesometj: hey
 MSmits: my othello bot is very similar to oware,
 awesometj: hello
 MSmits: sup awesometj
 awesometj: sup
 awesometj: MSmtis
 MSmits: you can use tab to finish my name
 MSmits: just type ms + tab
 awesometj: ms+tab
 MSmits: :face_palm:
 struct: lol
 struct: MSmits not 100% win rate, cancel the submit
 Scarfield: wow nice submit smitty, 1st so far?
 MSmits: it's still a very early version
 struct: you had 1 timeout
 struct: btrw
 MSmits: no tree reuse, no avx
 MSmits: ohh
 awesometj: what are you guys or girls talking about
 Scarfield: othello 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476556502">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476556502</a>
 MSmits: it didnt time out during search
 tomatoes: memory?
 MSmits: nah, it just never accepted my output
 MSmits: not sure
 MSmits: I think I was just too late
 struct: how much time of the 150ms are you using?
 MSmits: 145
 dbdr: that was quick MSmits, gg!
 MSmits: this happens to me in other games as well
 MSmits: thanks dbdr
 awesometj: u lose
 MSmits: only 15 people in wood 1
 MSmits: the difference in rating is insane
 MSmits: mostly Renard and up
 struct: dbd r is almost undefeated
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: need to figure out this expert mode
 struct: after reading the board
 struct: you get an extra input 
 struct: after your first output
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: do you still get all actions as well?
 Scarfield: "pass" or moves like "a2;c4"
 struct: all actions made since your last playable turn
 MSmits: i mean
 MSmits: do you still get all legal actions
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: the stuff i dont use
 MSmits: ok
 Scarfield: how many rollouts do you get?
 MSmits: lemme see
 MSmits: rollouts are a bit tricky to compare but Turn 1: 1,2 million.  Turn 2 84k
 MSmits: but a single rollout is not what you would expect
 Scarfield: depends on what i am expecting :p
 MSmits: those 84k rollouts are actually 644k root visits
 MSmits: because i eval every child 
 MSmits: and backpropagate that
 struct: you rollout every child?
 MSmits: I dont rollout
 MSmits: I eval
 Scarfield: damn, i have "some" optimization left
 struct: ah ept right?
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: 0 depth&#160;?
 MSmits: currently yeah
 MSmits: i always start with that these days, its easier to code
 MSmits: random rollout functions can be tough
 MSmits: sometimes it's a lot of code and it can be slow
 MSmits: btw, i also tried it on uttt, was not even half bad. I think rank 20-30
 MSmits: my eval was ok  I guess
 darkhorse64: It's not even EPT anymore, or Very Early PT
 MSmits: its not even mcts because no random
 struct: What do we call it?
 MSmits: well you can call it EPT depth 0, but it's still fundamentally different
 Scarfield: Immediate Propagation Termination Tree Search
 MSmits: sure why not
 dbdr: UCTS
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: though you can backpropagate many different ways
 dbdr: yes, that's the other aspect
 darkhorse64: You coined it&#160;?  It's very accurate
 MSmits: you can back prop the average child value, the highest child value , do some kind of deeper minimax search from the leaf
 dbdr: yes, never heard it before
 MSmits: yay top 10&#160;:)
 dbdr: I mean it's UCT + TS
 dbdr: UCT is the exploration formula
 MSmits: is it UCT or UCB
 MSmits: i hear both
 darkhorse64: UCB applied to Trees
 MSmits: is that really what UCT means?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: oh
 Scarfield: Upper Confidence Tree
 Scarfield: Upper Confidence Bound
 MSmits: it's weird to have part of your acronym be an acronym

 Scarfield: UCBT would have been to much to write
 MSmits: I wonder how well I picked the weights
 struct: Are they different?
 struct: wtf
 dbdr: part of the acronym is the acronym
 Scarfield: yea i see, thought it was just either Tree or Bound, today i learned :p
 MSmits: yeah, I forgot what a gnu was
 MSmits: I mean the animal
 dbdr: it's an animal that is not unix&#160;;)
 MSmits: apparently
 darkhorse64: gn all

 Hjax: MSmits you have no chill 
 MSmits: chili? The food?
 MSmits: not a fan
 Hjax: no, chill 
 MSmits: ahhhh
 Hjax: "it will probably rake me a few weeks to get something that wins games" 
 Hjax: *4 hours later* top 10 
 MSmits: hey, it's Robo's fault
 Hjax: how is it robos fault?
 MSmits: he shared a link where there was move generation code
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: what search / eval are you doing right now?
 MSmits: the sim usually takes me a lot of time
 MSmits: EPT depth 0
 MSmits: or UCTS 
 Hjax: with what eval?
 MSmits: mcts with no random, just eval
 MSmits: frontier, corners, move count
 MSmits: with weights for each
 Hjax: interesting 
 tomatoes: same :grinning:
 Hjax: i still dont know what i was doing wrong with frontier / corners / move count 
 Hjax: but its about 5 points worse than just move count 
 MSmits: well you do the &gt; 0  = win thing
 Hjax: i do, i think tomatoes does that too 
 MSmits: ah, well thats not it then
 MSmits: 	float normalized = evalScore / MAX_ADVANTAGE;	return evalScore &gt; 0&#160;? min(1.0f, normalized)&#160;: max(-1.0f, normalized);
 MSmits: capped between -1 and 1
 MSmits: because it cant be higher than win or loss
 Hjax: im going to try to write a fancy n tuples eval this weekend 
 MSmits: doesnt that require training off line or something?
 Hjax: it does 
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: is it just a weight field&gt;?
 MSmits: that results from training?
 MSmits: i should read that paper
 Hjax: yeah, huge array of numbers 
 MSmits: why huge?&gt;
 tomatoes: 3^tuple_size
 MSmits: whats tuple_size
 Hjax: basically you take some part of the board, and index into a weights array based on the position in just that part of the board
 tomatoes: pattern/part of the field
 Hjax: so if your tuple size is 5, you have some pattern of 5 locations on the game board 
 MSmits: how many cells are you looking at around that cell?
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: ok
 Hjax: the shape and number is up to you 
 Hjax: and then you have a bunch of these tuples, and weights arrays 
 Hjax: and you sum them 
 MSmits: ok so it is just a bunch of patterns you're looking up?
 tomatoes: it seems
 Hjax: its a score for every possible set of pieces in that subset of the board
 MSmits: interesting
 Hjax: for each subset of the board, you do the lookup 
 MSmits: right
 Hjax: and add to some total score 
 MSmits: jace k does this?
 tomatoes: i've only read, didnt try to implement yet
 Hjax: yes 
 MSmits: dbd r doesnt?
 Hjax: unknown 
 MSmits: oh
 Hjax: he said he has 300k weights 
 Hjax: so hes doing something 
 struct: doenst he have a crazy amount of weights?
 MSmits: dbd r has 300k weights?
 Hjax: but he hasnt said if its n tuples 
 struct: doesnt probcut require weights?
 Hjax: it does, but not that many weights 
 Hjax: "they compress well" -dbd r when i asked how on earth he has 300k weights
 MSmits: well i'll focus on implementing AVX and such before I do the eval
 Hjax: jace k said he has 60k weights i think? 
 tomatoes: 30 :thinking:
 Hjax: was it 30?
 Hjax: my bad 
 Hjax: i dont have avx or anything fancy like that 
 tomatoes: im not sure now
 MSmits: avx is actually not that hard to use. It's just hard to find a use for
 Hjax: but my code only spends 20% of its total time in move gen / make 
 Hjax: so its not really the bottleneck anyway 
 MSmits: i dont expect it to help a lot, but i am sure it will and that means I can finally use AVX in a bot 
 MSmits: I never have before. Well i tried but it never helped
 MSmits: i could do csb, but i dont want to.. i know it helps there
 MSmits: if I ever get back i will
 Hjax: i was trying to work out how many weights i can fit in my submission here 
 Hjax: and what n tuples scheme i want to use 
 Hjax: shape / size
 MSmits: how many different weight sizes do you want?&gt;
 MSmits: as in how many bits per weight?
 Hjax: i wasnt sure of that either 
 Hjax: i was thinking a byte is probably enough 
 MSmits: say you use 1 byte
 MSmits: then at max you can have 200k weights
 MSmits: unless you have many equal weights and can compress it somehow
 struct: 🚀 === 4 bytes
 MSmits: you have to figure out how to deal with symmetry also
 Hjax: ive mostly worked that out already 
 Hjax: well, ive worked out how to rotate bitboards 
 MSmits: I'd say you read in your weights in the first 2 seconds and then multipley the array by 4
 MSmits: then you dont need to rotate anything during the search
 MSmits: or by 8 actually
 Hjax: yeah i was about to say, its by 8 
 MSmits: right yeah
 MSmits: i do this for opening book in yavalath
 Hjax: i was thinking i would pre rotate the masks 
 Hjax: that get the part of the board for the tuples 
 MSmits: I read the book, then have a map to all 11 other symmetries of each move
 Hjax: then i just PEXT the board position 
 Hjax: and index into my table 
 MSmits: yeah thats good
 Hjax: i just need to make sure the bits are in the right order
 Hjax: if the low bit is the corner in one rotation, the low bit needs to be the corner in all rotations 
 MSmits: have fun with that :P
 Hjax: its a bit easier if my tuples are all straight lines 
 Hjax: because then they are either backwards or not 
 MSmits: they wont be
 MSmits: well 
 MSmits: they will be rectangles
 MSmits: 3 by 2 and such
 Hjax: i was thinking 4x1 chunks might be pretty reasonable 
 MSmits: i thought that paper had bigger chunks?
 Hjax: depends on the paper 
 Hjax: i found one that swore 1x2 was best for othello 
 MSmits: 1x2&#160;??
 Hjax: yep 
 Hjax: i dont buy that 
 MSmits: that wont give you many weights at all
 Hjax: but i can experiment with different weight sizes and shapes 
 MSmits: yeah
 Hjax: 4x1 just seemed like a straight forward place to start
 Hjax: nice and friendly with rotations 
 MSmits: this is basically like having lookup arrays for miniboards in uttt
 Hjax: i think of it as a really dumb neural network 
 MSmits: well dumb on the side of the program. It's actually more intelligent on the side of the programmer
 MSmits: with a real NN the programmer doesnt have a clue what is going on
 Hjax: the wikipedia page for it compared it to the kernel trick SVMs use 
 MSmits: no idea about that
 Hjax: where you are mapping the state to a higher dimensional space 
 MSmits: that sounds cool
 Hjax: SVMs just try to find a plane that separates your data 
 Hjax: used for supervised learning classifiers 
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I saw a lecture about that
 starmaq: hello
 MSmits: hi
 Hjax: but even if you have ugly data that doesnt look like you can separate it 
 Hjax: if you map it into a higher dimensional space 
 MSmits: yeah i get that, more degrees of freedom
 Hjax: yeah 
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: it's like fitting a function with more parameters
 Hjax: in the case of n tuples, it lets you encode positional knowledge by looking at a lot of chunks of the board 
 Hjax: a single square on the board is probably in several tuples 
 Hjax: and then can be good and bad at the same time 
 Hjax: for different reasons 
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: do you train this the same way as a nn? 
 Hjax: the papers recommend doing TD learning 
 MSmits: never done that
 Hjax: i found a big database of high quality othello games though 
 MSmits: it seemed weird to me
 Hjax: so i was thinking i would also try a pure supervised approach 
 MSmits: ah right you said that
 MSmits: I would prefer to combine this with a meta mcts
 MSmits: and use data from that
 struct: this database is from games played by AIs or players?
 Hjax: selfplay games by logistello
 Hjax: its pretty easy to find 
 MSmits: sounds nice
 Hjax: theres about 150k games in it i believe 
 Hjax: which should be enough to train some decent weights
 struct: 1997 last version
 Hjax: sure, but it was the best othello program for a long time 
 MSmits: you'll get good weights from that for sure
 Hjax: the games are probably not blunders all over the place 
 Hjax: so its high enough quality to train on 
 MSmits: the fact that it's old is probably mostly going to affect performance
 MSmits: not the accuracy of the weights
 Hjax: yeah im sure its eval is excellent 
 Hjax: it actually uses ntuples too 
 Hjax: the shapes were hand crafted
 Hjax: and then trained through self play 
 MSmits: nice
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://skatgame.net/mburo/log.html">https://skatgame.net/mburo/log.html</a>
 Hjax: the self played games are there, as well as a bunch of details about how the program works 
 MSmits: thanks

 MSmits: i know 1 ply before tric trac that I lost :P
 MSmits: not even done optimizing, with crap eval and already solve sooner than his ab/TT bot :P
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.orbanova.com/nbook/">http://www.orbanova.com/nbook/</a>
 struct: book from ntest
 Hjax: i havent added solver yet 
 MSmits: it always surprises me how well mcts can solve
 MSmits: intuitively you'd think minimax is better at this
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476363605">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476363605</a>
 Hjax: tric knows i win before i know i win 
 MSmits: what was your search type again?
 Hjax: mcts ept depth 6 
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: well it makes sense my way solves faster, I skip the random rollout
 Hjax: ill switch to depth 0 when i have my n tuples done probably 
 Hjax: ill do some testing to see whats better
 MSmits: that would be great, let me know if you want to share those results
 Hjax: im not planning on keeping any secrets in othello 
 MSmits: ah ok
 Hjax: so ill absolutely let you know&#160;:)
 MSmits: I share most, but not all
 struct: It seems that there are no winning moves
 struct: just losing moves
 MSmits: weird
 Hjax: how many nodes per move do you search smits? 
 Hjax: are you a lot faster than me?
 struct: at least if you follow the book moves
 MSmits: oh, let me see 
 struct: the  books stop
 MSmits: ROOT: visits: 656754
 struct: after a certain depth
 MSmits: every node has 1 value backpropagated
 MSmits: so 657k nodes checked
 Hjax: is that on a fast machine or a slow one 
 MSmits: let me try a few times
 Hjax: i either get 530k or 660k 
 Hjax: depending on which game runner i get 
 MSmits: this is turn 2?
 Hjax: turn 1 
 MSmits: I was talking about turn 2
 Hjax: oh wow lol 
 struct: :D
 Hjax: im getting about 60k 
 Hjax: past turn 1 
 MSmits: turn 1 is 6.6 Million
 Hjax: that would destroy my node pool 
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 20000000;
 MSmits: i currently dont reuse the tree
 Hjax: i do 
 MSmits: not sure what it would do to my node pool
 MSmits: i was going to work on that
 MSmits: but then there was interesting conversation here
 MSmits: and i'm tired
 Hjax: lets see how many playouts i get with depth 0
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: i get so many nodes because i eval each child
 MSmits: so one expansion phase = x moves = x nodes
 Hjax: oh so you uct less 
 MSmits: yes
 Hjax: i see 
 MSmits: also i skip over 1 child expansions
 MSmits: i just expand again
 MSmits: so passes and 1 move situations
 MSmits: oh and another thing
 MSmits: I save the board on the node
 MSmits: so I dont have to generate moves and apply them every time i go down the tree
 Hjax: why would you have to generate moves? 
 MSmits: hmm, sorry you dont
 MSmits: i mean apply the moves
 MSmits: thats also costly
 MSmits: i only UCT when going down the tree, at the end I expand and apply the move
 Hjax: yeah i might switch to that, i was concerned about memory usage 
 MSmits: it's two uint64_t
 MSmits: not too bad
 MSmits: assuming you keep the other stuff small
 Hjax: a boolean too?
 MSmits: which boolean?
 Hjax: whose turn it is?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: selectedCount &amp; 1
 MSmits: if it's 1 it's your turn
 Hjax: selectedCount? 
 struct: your node is two uint64=
 struct:&#160;?
 MSmits: no the boardstate is
 struct: ah
 MSmits: selected count is the number of nodes i selected
 MSmits: when going down the tree
 MSmits:  a selection is a turn
 Hjax: oh true
 MSmits: i store them in an array
 Hjax: so when i first wrote this 
 MSmits: so i can easily backprop
 Hjax: i was dumb and didnt have pass nodes 
 Hjax: but now i do, so i guess i dont need the boolean 
 MSmits: yeah, i usually dont have it 
 MSmits: also, I dont have any pointers
 MSmits: just an integer index
 MSmits: to the first node
 Hjax: same 
 Hjax: although my selection is recursive 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70417781-dfde-480f-a717-2d0ac5fd1936">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70417781-dfde-480f-a717-2d0ac5fd1936</a>
 Hjax: not a stack 
 MSmits: ah, i always use a while loop
 Hjax: i tried both when i was using java, it didnt seem to make much of a difference 
 MSmits: probably doesnt
 Hjax: i just like recursion better conceptually 
 MSmits: sometimes I do
 MSmits: when i get into a recursion frame of mind I accidentally turn simple loops into recursions also :P
 MSmits: I showed dbd r a function I wrote that I thought was really cool and he said, so... you're just looping from 1 to n?
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/051d5722-15b7-4e4a-b732-6130c4157f74">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/051d5722-15b7-4e4a-b732-6130c4157f74</a>
 Hjax: my node right now 
 MSmits: hmm when you calculate the value of a node you divide a float by an integer
 MSmits: better have two floats I think
 Hjax: it gets typecast first
 Hjax: but probably slightly slower 
 MSmits: yeah,  ihavent done any tests recently, but from what i remember, mcts works better if you keep them as two floats
 MSmits: slightly faster
 MSmits: incrementing rollouts is slower when they are floats
 MSmits: but its a small price
 Hjax: well im getting lots of things i can tweak, not sure how much more speed ill get 
 MSmits: do AVX
 MSmits: I think its the biggest speedup you can do, even if it is only 10-15%
 tomatoes: i had increment problem with float 
 MSmits: hey, how are endgame books in this game? They seem useless to me because there are too many board configs, but I am not sure
 tomatoes: its broken at 2^24
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: some bits are taken up by the scale part of the float
 Hjax: i dont think endgame tablebases work in othello
 struct: by the end is already too late
 Hjax: the game gets more complex, not less complex 
 Hjax: and yeah youve solved by then 
 MSmits: thats not a problem though
 MSmits: well the more complex part is
 MSmits: but you solve even sooner if you havea working endgame book
 MSmits: because you shave off nodes at the end of your tree
 MSmits: i do this in oware
 Hjax: yeah, chess engines do this 
 MSmits: all boards with &lt;= 6 seeds will end the tree immediately
 Hjax: every position with 7 or fewer pieces are solved 
 Hjax: no need to search more 
 struct: and they are very small
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: 10k bytes 
 MSmits: checkers too
 struct:  /s
 MSmits: what is small struct?
 Hjax: he was kidding 
 struct: I was being sarcasting
 MSmits: ohh
 Hjax: chess TBs are massive 
 MSmits: in oware they are tiny
 MSmits: well unless you want more than 6 seeds :P
 MSmits: my 15 seed db is 4gb
 MSmits: but endgame db for oware are actually harder to generate than endgame db for chess because you need to keep all future states in memory
 Hjax: so depth 0 is a 50% speedup for me 
 Hjax: and its awful lol 
 MSmits: nice
 Hjax: because my eval is awful 
 MSmits: oh&#160;:(
 tomatoes: do you have random child selection?
 MSmits: I dont
 MSmits: I eval all children so they're all visited the first time their parent gets expanded
 MSmits: after that it's UCT
 tomatoes: same
 MSmits: you should try onitama and oware next
 MSmits: your search will do well in both those games
 MSmits: I  need to go get some sleep. gn all!
 Hjax: goodnight
 tomatoes: gn
 Hjax: struct are you able to make changes to othello? 
 struct: depends
 struct: what Hjax?
 Hjax: struct the viewer doesnt show legal moves if you step through it with the arrows 
 Hjax: since the legal moves briefly vanish between animations 
 struct: I see, I will check if its possible to fix it 
 struct: so from what I read in my code
 struct: i commit at 0.00&#160;:/
 struct: I will try another thing
 struct: I think its possible to do
 struct: but not easy
 Hjax: its not a huge deal, its just a mild annoyance 
 struct: yeah Its like the frame at 0 is not equal to 0
 struct: :p
 Hjax: :P

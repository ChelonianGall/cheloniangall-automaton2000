 ShortBaited: sites wont load and everything is buggy
 ShortBaited: Site dosent even register that i leveled up a min ago
 BigFatDecker: while(num_valid_actions&lt;4):
 solution.cpp: depends on a lot of things, what are the variables, what do you mean by doesnt work
 BigFatDecker: the varible is set up as num_valid_actions = int(input()) and it just timesout
 Papyrus_HB: '3+3*2' how to evaluate the string from left to right instead of order of operation?
 solution.cpp: If there is no input received then input() will wait forever
 BigFatDecker: so how could i set it up to check if the row has less then 4 and if it does to move to the next row
 Papyrus_HB: x=0while x&lt;4:
 Papyrus_HB: x+=1
 Papyrus_HB: what about this?
 BigFatDecker: hmm i still get a timeout it is ok if i said the link to the puzzle so you can understand more of what im trying to do?
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-4</a>
 solution.cpp: can you send all your code?
 solution.cpp: Are you forgetting to print a response at the end?
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/iqWQAa1m">https://pastebin.com/iqWQAa1m</a>
 BigFatDecker: ok so thats my code i kinda screw it up even more i think haha
 Qyxi: (3+3) * 3. Use parenthesis Papyrus_HB
 solution.cpp: That code runs for me
 BigFatDecker: mine?
 solution.cpp: Yes
 solution.cpp: It doesn't beat the challenge but it does run
 iwantcakenow21: Gilbert moment
 GilbertGaming27: Gilbert
 BigFatDecker: it runs but times out after the first row i gotta be able to go to the next row after there is less then 4 spaces and i cant figure out an if tatement or anything haha
 solution.cpp: The timeout is probably caused because you have both print statements inside the scope of if
 solution.cpp: you could add an else clause with some general print(0) and see if it still times out
 Gnorty: is it just me or are there issues with the site atm? Im having clashes not launching, submitted code stuck at pending etc
 solution.cpp: Yes there are issues
 BigFatDecker: would i put general print(0) or put my variable in place for ther 0
 solution.cpp: i just mean for testing where you have if(turn_index&lt;64):have else:
 solution.cpp: it doesnt matter whats in the print just for testing if thats causing the timeout
 Qyxi: print(debug in else line xx)

 Nuggs: clashing dont be workin doe
 solution.cpp: refresh page on start
 Nuggs: ahh
 iwantcakenow21: why website be bad
 Nuggs: says the cakeman
 iwantcakenow21: ok
 brandex123: I can't bear it anymore
 Qyxi: BigFatDecker, the first for loop, it waits for an input, 7 times yes? What input is sent to it?
 brandex123: goodnight everyone
 BigFatDecker: haha i think ive been stariing at this for too long because now im just starting to confuse myself
 Qyxi: Why are you printing based on turnIndex instead of oppLastMove?
 DaNinja: start again, delete your two if's and replace with 
 DaNinja: print(action)
 Qyxi: Looking at the puzzle, it doesn't state which player starts, so I assume it's randomized in inizialization. So  checking for steal should include a check that your bot is 2nd player id 1 and that it's turn 2.
 Qyxi: Otherwise, that if blocks if your bot is 2nd player on rounds past 2nd
 Qyxi: Well, not blocks, but outputs invalid statement.
 BigFatDecker: ok i think im starting to get it
 Qyxi: Which, reading the context of the puzzle, should end the game due to invalid unreadable input.
 Qyxi: after turn 2 that is.
 Qyxi: But, if you say it's timing out, it may be that the game is rejecting "steal" on turn 4 and continues to wait. 
 Qyxi: if((turn_Index == 2) &amp;&amp; (myId == 1))
 Qyxi: print(-2)
 BigFatDecker: ok so im confused again why would i put negative 2? sorry if these are dumb questions
 Qyxi: That takes care of your bot being 2nd player and doing the steal, though a steal isnt' always best.
 Qyxi: The second player can output either the word STEAL or the integer -2 for this action.
 Qyxi: Right under the picture of showing the steal is that line.
 Qyxi: Only time a steal could be useful though would be if center of board, index 4, maybe 3 and 5 also
 Qyxi: steal at 0,9 and even 1,8 would literally back your bot into a wall with nowhere to grow/go
 BigFatDecker: so is tyhere anything i could do to prevent that?
 Qyxi: Yeah, add it to turn 2 checks.
 Qyxi: make a nested if to the check for turn 2, and then use an if(opp_previous_action == 4) 
 Qyxi: or the rest you want with it.
 Qyxi: You created x and x2, you inizialize them but throughout the course of the game never change them. So, if your bot plays 0 every turn
 Qyxi: omit the 'if' in that last line, it was a typo.
 j0eTheRipper: yo
 j0eTheRipper: I'm having a problem
 Qyxi: Which, by turn 8, or sooner, your bot  can't play, sending again invalid input, which should end the game, but likely causes a time out.
 j0eTheRipper: i'm trying this coders Strike back
 j0eTheRipper: think
 Qyxi: Think the game/site was lagging and most the real coders logged off.
 j0eTheRipper: anyway, i'm stuck at the second level, and i couldn't do anything about it
 Qyxi: What's the second level? Remind me please.
 j0eTheRipper: it gets you to some pseudo code, i'm supposed to implement it, i implemented it and it's not working
 Qyxi: Define the behavior your code is doing.
 j0eTheRipper: nothing, just nothing
 Qyxi: Does it time out causing you to lose? Does the match start?
 j0eTheRipper: the pseudo code says if the angle is more than 90, then set the thrust to 0, else set it to 100
 Qyxi: Okay. What does that look like in code?
 BigFatDecker: thank you everyone for the help im gonna get off my brain is scrambled and i just keep confusing myself more lol
 BigFatDecker: hope everyone has a good day/ night
 Qyxi: Coding frustrated and tired does lead to buggy code. Rest is good.
 M1nerman: I'm joining clashes but when the timer hits 0 nothing happens
 vrag: same here
 BigFatDecker: thank you so much for your help!
 Qyxi: Yes, the site is lagging.
 Wontonimo: the solution is to instead do something else, like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 Wontonimo: ur welcome
 Qyxi: Most folks logged off due to the lag problem. Some said opening a new tab and/or refreshing the browser helped briefly.
 vrag: yeah, the refreshing did solve the issue
 Qyxi: Did you get it worked out joeTheRipper?
 vrag: not yet
 j0eTheRipper: no
 j0eTheRipper: something is wrong with the instructions, i'm sure
 Qyxi: So the psuedo code says, if(angle &lt; 90) thrust =0 else thrust = 100
 Qyxi: if(angle &lt; -90 || angle &gt; 90)&#160;? thrust = 0&#160;: thrust = 100;
 Qyxi: In the previous tutorial it explained the output needed to be x, y, thrust.
 Qyxi: *Frown* I made it to bronze league without making a GA. Didn't mean to progress.
 Qyxi: Bummer, changing language doesn't restart the tutorial in that language.
 jrke: you can make to gold without any tough thing
 Qyxi: Yeah, but I figured more training time would potentially yield a better agent.
 jrke: no i mean without any algorithm you can make gold
 jrke: just with one pseudo
 Qyxi: Which, I gotta ask, is there a way to save on here? I mean, training an agent requires saving and loading yes?
 jrke: no you can't save any data on CG permanently
 Qyxi: I have a 3 if basic, if angle &gt;90 or &lt;-90 thrust 0 else if distance &lt;1500 thrust 50 else thrust 100
 Qyxi: So where does the agent data save after a race?
 Qyxi: Or, after a match since there are multiple game types/
 jrke: data is not saved anywhere your code runs each time you are matched
 Qyxi: I mean, the whole idea of a GA is not hardcoding the values.
 jrke: you can save data in variables
 Qyxi: that initializes from where?
 _Superman: why can i not see my friend online
 _Superman: even though he is online
 jrke: in chat _Superman&#160;?
 _Superman: in invite list
 _Superman: for a private clash
 jrke: maybe your friend has switched off the invite link feature
 _Superman: no 
 Qyxi: let them try inviting you
 jrke: ask your friend to check last option in this- <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/settings/notifications">https://www.codingame.com/settings/notifications</a>
 _Superman: ok
 _Superman: it was already checked
 Qyxi: can a file be loaded from the users pc, i'm trying to figure out where the weights and biases and nodes are saved, updated, and loaded to/from.
 jrke: Qyxi nothing can loaded from external files on CG 
 jrke: what do you wanna do btw?
 Qyxi: I read some articles where some folks use GA's for these competitions. I'm just wondering where the trained agent gets stored in between matches.
 octopuscabbage: you can just copy and paste in some json if you train it offline
 Qyxi: There is offline access to the games?
 jrke: you can train offline and save data in variables on CG
 octopuscabbage: no you'll have to write a forward simulator in your code anyway
 octopuscabbage: so you can just run that offline
 jrke: or you can use referee code to do that
 octopuscabbage: writing the forward simulator is what turns me off from most of teh bot programming on this website
 Qyxi: Ugg, quit the put off that is.
 Qyxi: Seems like it'd be easier to print a post match printout, and hardcode/update the agent's start values/variables at the start of each match.
 Qyxi: Until it becomes adequately trained, then just disable the training functions and leave the weights/biases hardcoded in.
 Qyxi: But, *shudder* can you imagine training a single agent at a time, updating after each match, and wash/rinse/repeat. That would be cringe worthy dedication.
 octopuscabbage: i don't see how it's any easier to train on CG than it is to just write a training loop with a forward simulator you write?
 octopuscabbage: unless you're just using learning so you don't have to write a forward simulator
 Qyxi: NEAT is drool worthy.
 Qyxi: Simplistic design, yet, baffling to observe.
 Qyxi: It's like othello, 5 mins to learn and a lifetime to master.
 Qyxi: Well, you know what I mean. It's just cool to watch NEAT do what it does and usually does it quickly.
 octopuscabbage: i don't think NEAT works very well in the "real world" tbf 
 Qyxi: Well, if it works poorly, it's not the agents fault. It's inadequate information passed from the creator.
 octopuscabbage: people just over emphasize "bio-inspired" design
 octopuscabbage: well if it performs poorly relative to other algorithms it's the agents fault? lol
 Qyxi: What scares me is the over eager minds that let lose skynet agents.
 Qyxi: In any GA
 Qyxi: Robert Miles has a channel where he disucusses the potential dangers that are often overlooked when working with GA's. 
 techgoat222: hey i<b>m in atlanta</b>
 techgoat222: @Oyxi what city are you in&#160;?
 Qyxi: GA (Genetic Algorithm) Smart AI.
 Qyxi: Memphis.

 Louis.: salut
 Qyxi: Saw a video of a robotic spider thing. The fitness function gave it points when it's feet were off the ground, and took away points while it's feet was touching the ground. Seems logical that the spider would minimize it's feet touching the ground, thus move faster yeah?
 Qyxi: The spider rolled over on its back, and used it's knees  to walk, so it maximized it's points. Great example of something overlooked by the devs. 
 dbdr: sounds pretty silly. it would want to maximize speed, measure speed, not feet contact
 dbdr: *if

 jacek: just like some video games when ai finds the glitches to collect more points
 Qyxi: Right, cheating ai's.
 jacek: would be fun to see what 'glitches' in real world would they find
 Qyxi: I read somewhere that a NN was used to make the ai of a game, but didn't provide any nerf versions. It was unplayable because the ai was to good.
 Qyxi: I'm sure there's data/videos out there of some unexpected results on the self driving cars tests.
 Qyxi: What's that new intelligent engine, GSA 3 maybe?
 Qyxi: Let me google that, GSA 2 recently got an overhaul making the 3rd version
 Qyxi: GPT-3
 Qyxi: The articles about that are interesting. I often frown on the use of how they describe the ai's actions/chooses as 'probabilities' rather than as intelligent choices.
 Qyxi: Anyway, back to the things happening on this site. I still haven't worked out on paper how to solve that silly nugget riddle. 
 Qyxi: I've begun losing sleep over it.

 BlaiseEbuth: Absolutely. And in the case of an user flooding with pointless questions&#160;? :3
 Alexandru_Becher: If you get kicked from a private(invite only) community than you can get another invite from a friend.But if you get banned from that community than it is bad.
 Alexandru_Becher: Hmm.. I think a warning message to explain him what he did wrong and after that kicked him.
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: You're a wise man.
 Alexandru_Becher: Thanks, I just rejoin on the platform to learn some c++ for game programmer job.

 Hardcode_QD: please help me! Shadows of knight - episode 1 test cases 4
 Tiramon: Hardcode_QD have you looked at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/binary-search">https://www.codingame.com/learn/binary-search</a> which describes how to solve it?
 Notter: My code for Skynet ep 2 involves a graph Class containing a node Class
 Hardcode_QD: Tiramon thank you so much
 Tiramon: Notter maybe you can reduce some redudancy?like if you already calculated the distance between A-&gt;Byou only have to calc distance between B and C in a A-&gt;B-&gt;C way
 Tiramon: also if distances don't change you don't have to calc them everytime but only once
 Notter: Why do I need node distance?
 Tiramon: you need to calc path in skynetand if you already know a path and it hasn't changed you don't have to recalc it or if you know a part of the path you don't have to recalc the complete path
 Notter: Well my approach is to simply look for links to cut each turn
 Notter: Ok maybe not simply
 Tiramon: and to do that effectivly you have to predict the path skynet takes
 Tiramon: which needs some kind of pathfinding
 Tiramon: also if you don't get a result in time it can always be some kind of infinite loop you've run into
 Tiramon: in skynet 2 i first create a list of nodes with multipl gateways attached, because those are the most dangerous ones, all others can be cut when the agent is rigth at the link
 Notter: My approach is to create the graph during the initialization with lists of nodes and links

 MajorH5: !1%1 = 0   - When it should equal - !1%1 = false
 Astrobytes: Can't believe I got dragged into playing this lol
 struct:&#160;! comes first
 MajorH5: lol im so confused. I would have won if that worked as expected 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: It started with "OK I'll just submit a -3vel to keep Wontonimo happy"
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Famous last words
 eulerscheZahl: or "i'll just say a quick 'hi' before getting offline and going for a walk"
 eulerscheZahl: anyway, g2g
 Astrobytes: see ya later euler
 Scarfield: its fun, more of us doing the same, chat alive, win win imo

 Astrobytes: fair point ParticipationField
 Scarfield: AstroHiggs
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 2kpro: what are you playing
 Astrobytes: SLCC SF2442
 Astrobytes: CSB/SR-like
 Scarfield: and i fixed a lot of weird stuff from my copy paste csb bot, now im wondering if i can be bothered to go back to csb and fix it there
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've noticed some stuff too
 struct: Honestly I could not bother to read my csb code
 struct: Too much of a mess
 2kpro: i now 24 coding lanquages
 struct: Damn
 struct: I cant even code in 1
 2kpro: my dad tought me 
 2kpro: i only been coding for a year
 Scarfield: i can ride a bike with no handlebars
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and my left arm is a golf club
 2kpro: thats a a classic lots of people can ride a bike with no handles
 2kpro: im not even in middle school
 struct: Im not surprised 
 2kpro: ok
 Scarfield: you could learn to play guitar in less than a week, only 6 stringent days
 2kpro: i guees every in this chat talking is over 12 years old

 Astrobytes: struct is only 6 months old
 Scarfield: pure prodigy
 Scarfield: i am also not in middle school

 2kpro: me
 BlaiseEbuth: this thing does not exit
 BlaiseEbuth: *exist
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not in middle school either...
 2kpro: so everyone is ten years old like me
 BlaiseEbuth: Last time I go, they called the police 'caus I was "frightening the children"... Meh&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: just ask your question sonic1991, be specific and someone will help if they can.&#160;:)
 sonic1991: I already figure it out
 sonic1991: but its inspiring

 Astrobytes: 42
 2kpro: oky
 2kpro: i never said the infinity number yet 
 2kpro: so dont get ahead of yourself
 Astrobytes: Noted.
 2kpro: ok so what is 1000 times infinity 60
 KiwiTae: infinity60 wtf
 ZarthaxX: KiwiTae you wouldnt understand that
 Astrobytes: 1337.8008135
 ZarthaxX: it*
 2kpro: shut up your god da.. mouth KIWITae

 TankerElite: oh cool it makes longer messages into pastebin pastes
 TankerElite: basically had an issue with the checkpoint passing system and having 0 speed and velocity at the exact cirumference of a checkpoint
 TankerElite: any way to report this?
 struct: I highly doubt there is a bug
 KiwiTae: the engine thinks you passed the checkpoint so you passed it :D
 TankerElite: I did the math, and at the coordinates that my ship reported it is, i was not only not on the circumference, but on the inside of the 600-unit radius around a checkpoint's middle, unless I am being done in by float inaccuracy 
 TankerElite: the reason my ship didn't zoom off to the next checkpoint was because I didn't get the checkpoint pass from that "collision" with the checkpoint area
 struct: well if its off by 1 it is possible
 struct: referee uses doubles iirc
 2kpro: sorry KIWITae
 KiwiTae: 2kpro o/ I do that effect to many ah
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 2kpro: What does afk mean 
 ZarthaxX: away from keyboard
 2kpro: ok
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Last life 2kpro... :3

 2kpro: no clue
 Smelty: hmm......
 ZetaQ: :o
 eulerscheZahl: they changed the chat limit
 eulerscheZahl: to allow company chatting during the last contest
 eulerscheZahl: and with external clients it was always possible I think

 Marzuh: i have next expression:accelerationCoefficent = (1.14-(578/(nextCheckpointDist+1)));nextCheckpointDist =3124.why in debugger rusult is 1.14? i checked with my calc and result is 0.95504
 jacek: :tada:
 MajorH5: hello
 MajorH5: how do I make a private game for me and my friend
 MajorH5: private COC game
 Miki09: In clash of code page you scroll down and there's start a private clash.
 MajorH5: found it, thanks dude
 wlesavo: Marzuh im not an expert but in that order nextCheckpointDist  is not initialized, and possibly is a very large number, so the fraction is close to zero
 struct: i tried on tech io
 struct: and it works fine
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/tdY3hvC">https://tech.io/snippet/tdY3hvC</a>
 struct: I dont know rust
 struct: sorry for the warnings
 struct: I think you need to add .0
 struct: 578.0 and 1.0
 wlesavo: lol illedan aiming for those most precious prises
 eulerscheZahl: he still has to beat Dapo
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: and a few more people hiding
 Marzuh: nextCheckpointDistance initialization is in row 23, my expression in row 39
 struct: Should that matter?
 wlesavo: yeah, then its probably about integer division as struct said
 KiwiTae: Dapo made a come back?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, in January for another private contest
 KiwiTae: oh cool was wondering where he disappeared lol
 struct: What is the main reason of these hackathon being hidden?
 eulerscheZahl: paid by a private company
 eulerscheZahl: CG won't do free advertising for them
 Marzuh: struct tnx, i will try
 ZarthaxX: did he win toad?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 ZarthaxX: damn
 ZarthaxX: how does he do it lol
 ZarthaxX: always wins
 struct: What was the previous one like?
 eulerscheZahl: codebusters
 struct: ah right
 ZarthaxX: ah well
 ZarthaxX: he is top there lol
 struct: I remember him having rank 1 bot on codebusters
 Astrobytes: slightly modified version thereof
 eulerscheZahl: with 3 busters having specific abilities (attack ghost, catch ghost, stun)
 ZarthaxX: ah okey, not so easy to port
 ZarthaxX: :P
 eulerscheZahl: no, pretty different game
 ZarthaxX: still insane guy
 eulerscheZahl: but that variation was another private hackathon before
 eulerscheZahl: and guess who won there :D
 Astrobytes: Klee iirc
 ZarthaxX: :DDDDD
 jrke: hoping a semi-private contest for indians&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the email leak hackathon
 ZarthaxX: was he actually eligible for prizes?
 ZarthaxX: sometimes it's company related only
 Astrobytes: lol yeah euler, that one
 eulerscheZahl: he won a PS5 in the recent codebusters
 ZarthaxX: WTF
 ZarthaxX: daaaaaamn
 struct: He needs a second controler
 struct: So he will win this ps5
 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and mean max had that home entertainment system as 1st prize
 struct: I wonder if pb 4 is making a NN for this one
 ZarthaxX: the guy has equipped his room by leeching cg
 Scarfield: wait there is prices for slcc?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 eulerscheZahl: what's slcc?
 Astrobytes: sf2442
 struct: sofia labs coding challenge
 Astrobytes: CSB/SR SLCC SF2442
 Astrobytes: Cause we all love acronyms
 Scarfield: Cwala
 Astrobytes: I like that
 Astrobytes: you can say it like "koala"
 Scarfield: :koala:
 <b>**eulerscheZahl hates acronyms&#160;:(</b>
 Astrobytes: I know :P
 jrke: can i compete by selecting different country in slcc?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Also it's Zulu for "to dress the hair"
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but they probably won't ship prizes to India
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: But you can play for fun if you like
 Wontonimo: yes, play for fun
 Scarfield: and why in the world would you know that? xD
 Wontonimo: even if it is just 10 min.  help fill out that leaderboard for others
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Google!
 Scarfield: lol i like that you checked if it was a thing 
 Astrobytes: naturally :D
 jrke: so unlike CSB the pod can rotate any degree not only 18 in slcc?
 eulerscheZahl: just a rightclick away
 eulerscheZahl: yes, pods don't have a direction
 dimCreature: Hey, all.  I know nothing about coding, but want to learn C.  Is it reasonable to learn through these skill branches?
 dimCreature: Or should I find another resource?
 ZarthaxX: it's better to learn in another platform and come here when you have some sort of idea  id say
 eulerscheZahl: codingame assumes that you have a bit of prior knowledge (if-else, loops and such)
 dimCreature: Alright, thanks.  I know about if-else, loops, while statements and the like, but this seems over my head.
 eulerscheZahl: some new users struggle with the communication concept at first

 BlaiseEbuth: We all float down there euler... :clown::balloon:
 Astrobytes: ... and you'll float too!
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 JaguarTordu: why are private CoC way easier than normal ones? Can I select a difficulty?
 nmcodes: :fried_shrimp:
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no difficulty levels in CoC JaguarTordu
 struct: I think there is an hidden difficulty level
 jrke: what to simulate in slcc i am not sure lol 
 struct: the entire game?
 jrke: no mean like we had some fixed space for rotation in this there no rotation bound
 dbdr: it's also fixed, was -18..18, here it's -180..180&#160;;)
 jrke: why didn't you wrote -pi to +pi :stuck_out_tongue:
 dbdr: to be consistent&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: hi dbdr, you have a spammer at your wiki page&#160;;)

 Astrobytes: Look forward to your n-tuples playground jacek
 dbdr: &gt; Thats why we have in Germany a Wohnungseigentümergemeinschaft overwatched by a Wohnungseigentümergemeinschatsverwaltung. They decide what is done on the gemeinschaftseigentum.
 eulerscheZahl: TryAngle catch was slightly inspired by that Amadeus planet conquering contest
 Astrobytes: Yes, I thought that
 Astrobytes: (it's on the list btw, I took a break for a bit)
 eulerscheZahl: me too
 eulerscheZahl: and other priorities such as topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: coderone starts in 2 weeks, i might participate
 Scarfield: when was that amadeus contest westi linked leaderboard for?
 eulerscheZahl: and CG contest collides with codejam round 2&#160;:/
 jacek: makise kurisu?
 eulerscheZahl: hover over the submit dates Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: there are tooltips
 eulerscheZahl: submit scores I mean
 Astrobytes: gocoder eulerscheZahl?

 Astrobytes: yes
 eulerscheZahl: similar to hypersonic

 Astrobytes: Same struct
 Astrobytes: might give it a shot euler
 eulerscheZahl: 68c9c0f65e242d686fe26fffc1a830ad7451a2ae4238a9d3f30e0d913e4b2b6c
 eulerscheZahl: my prediction for the CG contest
 ZarthaxX: hey what is that aisports thingy nice :O
 eulerscheZahl: the FAQ says it's python/typescript only. but on their discord they confirmed that you can submit a docker container this time =&gt; any language
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to create the container yourself, starters only exist for python and typescript
 DiogoMacedo: anyone can help on beating coders strike back?
 DiogoMacedo: c++
 eulerscheZahl: and recurse is on their discord channel too
 ZarthaxX: pity&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: the container thingy i mean, not recur
 BlaiseEbuth: I'd say both
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Astrobytes: shots fired :fire:

 ZarthaxX: what is this
 Astrobytes: Wonder when we get our shirts from last RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: story of me winning a tshirt at kotlin heroes. and it getting shipped back to Russia
 ZarthaxX: okey i was about to ask why that german -&gt; russia again
 ZarthaxX: the f&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: right, did we even receive the email to claim our tshrit yet?
 eulerscheZahl: for RAIC2020
 Astrobytes: Not that I've seen
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i'm slowly losing track
 ZarthaxX: forget about it, it's ded
 jacek: german -&gt; russia? *poland nervous looks*
 Astrobytes: :D
 wlesavo: Astrobytes i also took a corona break :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: you got infected?
 wlesavo: yeah, quite taugh one, im not often being ill so wasn't expected it to be that bad 
 Astrobytes: Ah that sucks. Was bad for me too.
 ZarthaxX: oh nooo
 wlesavo: at least i finally can sit at the pc, so thats a relief
 ZarthaxX: are you ok&#160;??
 Astrobytes: was about 6 weeks in total for me I think, first 4 weeks the worst
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: wlesavo&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: Not hospitalised I hope wlesavo?
 ZarthaxX: we got my grandma vaccinated 2 days ago
 ZarthaxX: still need onre more dosis tho
 ZarthaxX: virus is getting scarier D:
 Astrobytes: My mum got 1st dose AZ the other week
 BlaiseEbuth: At least you have vaccines...
 ZarthaxX: that one has been having bad fame right?
 ShortBaited: the german school system is dying of corona because only 7 billion are served but almost 20 billion are needed
 ZarthaxX: france didnt negotiate vaccines?
 ZarthaxX: every country has that problem i guess
 BlaiseEbuth: Lel. I feel like I live in big bad joke
 wlesavo: Astrobytes oh wow, better for me then. no no hospitalisation, but barely, i got 25% lung damage and i think they sometimes hospitalize with 30-40 already
 Astrobytes: Politicisation of vaccines (and healthcare imo) is just hideous.
 eulerscheZahl: 7 billions? :o
 Anwar_Yf: waw thats huge
 ShortBaited: yeah i speak of milliarden but milliarden  in englisch is billions
 eulerscheZahl: i hope no permanent lung damage wlesavo?
 ZarthaxX: i think they said it was kind of permanent
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: you were very lucky not to be hospitalised for sure. My mum was close but a steroid-based inhaler/spacer worked to open the airways
 ZarthaxX: thank god damn
 ZarthaxX: have you seen the news abotu the new mutation?
 ZarthaxX: mix of 18 different mutations
 Astrobytes: I've lost track!
 wlesavo: i hope as well euler :slight_smile: first day i finally coded smth, just in time for code jam
 Astrobytes: Viruses being viruses
 BlaiseEbuth: The virus tuning his AG
 Astrobytes: literally&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/brazil-finds-new-virus-variant-combining-18-mutations/2201998">https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/brazil-finds-new-virus-variant-combining-18-mutations/2201998</a>
 ZarthaxX: you can find it anywhere i guess
 ZarthaxX: the problem is this part too"It is as if these variants were evolving," Santana said, adding the new variant includes the same genes modified by Brazil's Manaus, known as P1, British and South African variant.
 Astrobytes: The deadlier it gets the less it spreads - and hopefully dies out as a result
 eulerscheZahl: so that happens if you get infected by multiple versions at once?
 ZarthaxX: mix of the deadlier mutations
 ZarthaxX: i guess toad
 wlesavo: also i got myself fired the day before i got ill and shouldve been employed on a new place, but covid happened
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes for real? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Think about it ZarthaxX
 ShortBaited: the german school have little to no technical items, then every student need laptops, etc. then we need server's for the online platform's and workers. then we also need money for maintenance work. so 7 billions are nuts for that what germany needs lmao
 eulerscheZahl: how does one get himself fired?
 ZarthaxX: oh you had your new work wlesavo damnn
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you mean 7 billion Euros?
 Astrobytes: Oh so you haven't started at the imaging job wlesavo?
 ShortBaited: 7 Milliarden Euro
 eulerscheZahl: i thought 7 billion vaccines, which would make no sense :D
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i dont get why lol
 ZarthaxX: yeah i thought the same lmao
 Astrobytes: How can dead people spread the virus ZarthaxX?
 ShortBaited: xD no not 7 billion vaccaines xD
 jacek: xD
 ShortBaited: with 7 billion vaccains we could save most of the world xD
 jacek: are you altfield?
 Scarfield: people needs 2 vaccines, account for some misplacements etc, 7 billion close enough
 wlesavo: Astrobytes ZarthaxX yes, didn't started yet, but at least they wait for me :slight_smile: and i have some tasks which i do in a free time
 Scarfield: get well soon wlesavo, its an order&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes  08:16PMHow can dead people spread the virus ZarthaxX?
 Westicles: CA is supposed to open up completely in June, except we still have to wear t-shirts wrapped around our heads
 Astrobytes: Oh that's good to hear wlesavo!
 Astrobytes: euler :D
 wlesavo: thx Scarfield, i already got my sences back, so i think it will be ok :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I have a feeling places are opening up a bit too fast - and without enough due care.
 Astrobytes: And don't get me started on digital vaccination 'passports'
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes ah well didnt think about people dying, thought another thing lol
 Westicles: Too fast?  lol
 ZarthaxX: wlesavo nice ;D have fun now that you are back 
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: Which part of deadlier made you think of something other than death? :D
 BlaiseEbuth: lier
 Westicles: I'd say the herpes epidemic is about 1000 times more serious
 Astrobytes: Tell that to the dead people and their families&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes nah nah haha, i thought you meant that because the virus was like more powerful it had less capability of spreading
 ZarthaxX: not that as it kills more, it can spread less as a consequence
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Scarfield: just admit it, you were thinking zombies
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: nah, it does depend how quickly it kills though. How far one can travel whilst spreading etc.
 ZarthaxX: yeah our brains are in danger of being eaten by a zombie pandemic
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes aye
 Astrobytes: It's a very interesting little virus
 ZarthaxX: also im afraid about vaccines effectivity after all tehse powerful mutations
 ZarthaxX: i find it super intersting that such a tiny thing causes so much trouble in mankind 
 ZarthaxX: for*
 Astrobytes: And mark my words I swear it came out of that lab in Wuhan that - uh, you know, studies coronaviruses...
 eulerscheZahl: "in" isn't wrong
 ZarthaxX: yeah im down for that conspiracy theory too lol
 Westicles: I'd rather kiss a girl with covid than a girl with herpes
 ZarthaxX: for real?
 ZarthaxX: thought it was
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Scarfield: yea it is, but a human sized virus would be pretty terrifying
 ZarthaxX: scarfo spreading
 ZarthaxX: sounds super scary :P
 eulerscheZahl: I'd rather kiss a woman than a girl :P
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: human sized virus - celebrities? :D
 ZarthaxX: wth
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Scarfield: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: I'd rather wait for her to be healed...
 Scarfield: i'd rather kiss a shiny metal ...
 Astrobytes: I happen to have a shiny metal one right here for you
 Scarfield: :kissing_heart:
 therealbeef:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I mean, it's not metal, but I like metal
 eulerscheZahl: if i take the first 2 and the last letter of Astrobytes.. :thinking:
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: regarding the Wuhan lab and the virus - I think it escaped, not deliberately released.
 Westicles: Astrobytes, you get in trouble if you say that in the US.  You are being anti-Asian
 eulerscheZahl: here we have freedom of speech
 Westicles: Tons and tons of propaganda on this
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes ah ok, but do you believe it was created by people?
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you don't deny the holocaust. that can get you in prison
 Westicles: Getting us ready for the invasion of Taiwan, I think
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl internationalyl? 
 Astrobytes: Ah right. Destroying legit racism claims with bullshit again so that no-one takes *any* of it seriously.
 eulerscheZahl: ZarthaxX i don't get that question
 Astrobytes: Yes, I can see Taiwan trouble on the horizon for sure.
 ZarthaxX: that holocaust thingy
 ZarthaxX: you meant that you could get in prision in germany by denying it
 Astrobytes: It's a crime in a few places
 Astrobytes: iirc
 ZarthaxX: so not only in germany
 ZarthaxX: what's up with taiwan? is there a war about to happen for real? D:
 Westicles: Yeah, they put David Irving in jail for a few years.  Austria I think
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Holocaust_denial">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Holocaust_denial</a>
 struct: yet in america its free speech
 ZarthaxX: struct we are a joke
 ZarthaxX: wow Astrobytes interesting
 Scarfield: if Ille wins, im calling dibs on his PS5!
 Astrobytes: I find genocide denial to be the more 'intriguing' (for want of a better word) situation.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, very touchy subjects here.We should move on.
 Scarfield: agreed
 Scarfield: however interesting
 Astrobytes: Meet me at the back of the CSB Pod Sheds for further talks :P
 Scarfield: i like my new and increased odds for getting a PS5
 Astrobytes: Nice submit Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: Scarfield 08:41PMif Ille wins, im calling dibs on his PS5!
 Astrobytes: Smitsi-ing?
 eulerscheZahl: also why wouldn't he keep the PS5 to himself?
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Astrobytes: I think he wanted 3rd prize
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd looks pretty lame
 eulerscheZahl: and 1st is for Dapo
 Scarfield: thanks, but was reffering to my dibs decleration
 Astrobytes: yeah I know but I just looked at the lb
 Scarfield: and yea smitsi
 Astrobytes: Nice
 Scarfield: my pod is still overly fond of boosting unnecessarily, but that is a tomorrow problem
 struct: just add a limit on boosts per lap
 Westicles: Is Russia usually considered EU for this kind of thing?
 struct: yes
 jacek: :unamused:
 Astrobytes: They do take up a fairly huge area of Europe admittedly
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: my bot should not beat you, you have bugs
 Scarfield: replay? probably segfault
 Scarfield: found it
 Ordonnateur: In python you can't change a precise string index value no&#160;? (change here with hare for ex)
 struct: you used all bosts in the first 5 turns
 struct: damn
 Scarfield: me, sounds like my overexited bot? xD
 Astrobytes: It likes leaving?
 Astrobytes: "overexited"
 Scarfield: will add a message: "I am speed, brrr" for next submit
 snoyes: Ordonnateur: strings are immutable
 Scarfield: Ordonnateur python strings are immutable, so no you cannot directly change a string
 snoyes: you could build a new one. s = s[:i] + 'a' + s[i+1:]
 Scarfield: meant excited ealier ofc, didnt even notice my mistake when you mentioned it xD
 Astrobytes: :P
 KittyCaty: Why I cant use prod from math library (python 3)
 Ordonnateur: Thank you for the idea of creating a new string, i founded an other way but uglier x)
 Scarfield: the sad realisation that i didnt jump up a rank, but a better bot was resubmitted&#160;:'(
 Illedan: jft63 submitted :O
 Astrobytes: We just have to wait 3 hours to see what happens
 snoyes: KittyCaty: prod is 3.8, and I think this uses something a little older
 jft63: Illedan will see
 Illedan: :D
 snoyes: KittyCaty: yeah, 3.7.4
 Scarfield: your new submit is out for blood 
 Astrobytes: oof not wrong
 KittyCaty: Oh get it, thanks
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS also having a rather good submit so far
 yiyi1234: hi
 yiyi1234: hi everyone
 yiyi1234: where are u from?
 Pierre-mikeLeMeliner: HAWAII 
 struct: How long do submits take +-?
 Pierre-mikeLeMeliner:&#160;? 
 Scarfield: 1½ hrs almost for mine
 Scarfield: just finished
 Pierre-mikeLeMeliner: what is submit&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Yeah about 1.5 seems average
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: :zzz:
 Astrobytes: Nice job btw Illedan, you've really gone in on this one :D
 Scarfield: too bad its all for nothing :p
 Astrobytes: 3rd place is calling!
 Illedan: Who are after Dapo?
 Astrobytes: Can't see re Curse playing, karlis o maybe? Donno who else hides
 Illedan: reCur is not from europe. Karlis o doesn't play these games, only board games
 Astrobytes: Hm, fair point.
 Illedan: pb4 might come though
 Astrobytes: Training as we speak no doubt&#160;:)
 Illedan: There is a lot of CG servers beeing fried tonight with benchmarks
 Astrobytes: Yes, started about mid-afternoon I noticed
 Astrobytes: early-mid
 struct: Maybe one day all matches played will be public
 Astrobytes: Is Jeff 06 hiding?
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: I have an agentId in my bench anyway..
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Scarfield: he is, and i think i know what he is hiding :zipper_mouth:
 struct: time to add if (time &gt; x) then player weaker version
 struct: play*
 Astrobytes: what do you mean Scarfield?
 Scarfield: had a replay against him where he won, but i feel its a bit bad mannered to say how if he is hiding
 Scarfield: actually not sure what i think, hiding is a bit weird to me as well
 Astrobytes: I'm not a fan of hiding per se, but it's allowed on the platform so... 
 Westicles: You hide so people don't train against you?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes. That's the gist of it.
 Westicles: Is that the same thing when smits does his book thing and recurse yells at him?
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: lmao
 jacek: books are part of games, deal with it
 TheIronImpAndHisDog_9c6b: hi
 Scarfield: tbh i dislike the books part of bots, it beats the purpose of the bot to some extent i think
 jacek: nah, they are ok if books are generated in more general way than against specific opponent
 yiyi1234: hi
 yiyi1234: im from Vietnam
 Scarfield: hi
 jacek: hi from Vietnam, we're dads
 Scarfield: xD
 ZarthaxX: jacek never stop trolling
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: He walks the line but dammit he's good :D
 jacek: trolling is a art
 ZarthaxX: yeah lol
 Anwar_Yf: lol
 Astrobytes: *an art
 Scarfield: i still think it moves some of the competitive aspect away from the bot writing itself, but meh
 ZarthaxX: Scarfield but the book isnt infinite 
 ZarthaxX: you still need a good bot
 Astrobytes: It's part of the competitive aspect though
 Scarfield: true true
 Astrobytes: For some games, yes, you can book the whole thing - but not true for everything
 Scarfield: its not something i feel strongly about, but having the bot guided by a book, and not by itself per se, is in a grey area of botting imo
 ZarthaxX: want to see a NN as an attempt to do an infinite book?
 Stormalix: bottong
 Stormalix: oops
 ZarthaxX: can you*
 Stormalix: botting
 Scarfield: hmm
 Stormalix: u guys are trying to make a bot write a book :thinking:
 jacek: yeah, some argue NN is book :unamused:
 Astrobytes: Not quite the same though
 ZarthaxX: damn
 Scarfield: isnt it to some extent a book
 ZarthaxX: it seems so
 jacek: Stormalix no. opening books for games
 Astrobytes: But it's more general
 Scarfield: maybe its just because i cant be bothered to make a book myself, and then use my prejudice against it as a shield
 Scarfield: :p
 ZarthaxX: right hyaha
 Astrobytes: if (book) cout &lt;&lt; "SHIELD"
 Scarfield: "they only win against me because they use unfair advantages, grr!"
 Scarfield: shady methods etc :p
 ZarthaxX: should be disqualified right scarfo
 Scarfield: the ones who wins against me? sure!
 ZarthaxX: hehe
 struct: I need Msmits
 ZarthaxX: if anyone is above scarfo -&gt; cheating
 ZarthaxX: he ded
 ZarthaxX: whats up
 Astrobytes: Smits busy with the school stuff, I think his end of term project and shizzle
 jacek: 3 2 is best opening in yavalath!
 Astrobytes: lol, the Smits Beacon
 struct: I think its fixed
 Astrobytes: it's like talking about ML and inoryy appearing
 The_10x_Engineer: :eyes: Is Machine learning cheating?
 struct: yes
 The_10x_Engineer: I knew it 
 The_10x_Engineer: :muscle: :brain:
 The_10x_Engineer: brain
 The_10x_Engineer: 🧠
 The_10x_Engineer: wow I just got it
 Smelty:  
 The_10x_Engineer:  
 Shattered: Any one have ideas for why C++ Test cases are so different from the submission? Am i Missing something?
 struct: Which puzzle?
 Shattered: all of them! heck the only reason I figured out the shadows of the knight was to put in all the answers for all of the "validation" into the code layout
 The_10x_Engineer: :pensive:
 Shattered: &lt;.&lt; I feel like I am missing something. I understand that the Test cases are different. 
 struct: you are writing generic code right?
 Astrobytes: Validators on submit are different from the testcases. To prevent hard-coding answers
 ZarthaxX: the newbie struggle
 The_10x_Engineer: :pensive: 
 Shattered: @Zarthaxx Pretty much. New to the site
 Astrobytes: When you say ... "put in all the answers for all of the "validation" into the code layout" do you mean you hardcoded the answers?
 The_10x_Engineer: Astrobytes looks like they dont work anymore lol
 Smelty: oh my
 ZarthaxX: see Shattered, you dont need to hardcode values based on each testcase
 ZarthaxX: instead you should read the input and assign THOSE values
 ZarthaxX: assign/use
 Astrobytes: And solve the general problem.
 ZarthaxX: right
 Astrobytes: *general case.
 ZarthaxX: as ifthe problem was calculate the sum of a+b
 ZarthaxX: you get a and b
 ZarthaxX: if one testcase says a=2 and b=3, you dont hardcode in your code that case
 Shattered: i understand how to code. just not where to "do the puzzle"
 ZarthaxX: like you dont doif a==2 and b==3 then print 5
 Shattered: Then again. perhaps i don't
 ZarthaxX: wdym by do?
 struct: show us your code
 ZarthaxX: struct ohhh sweetie slowdown there&#160;:*

 Astrobytes: ^ might be some useful stuff in there
 Shattered: Thats what i wanted. thank you
 The_10x_Engineer: Imagine being new lol
 Scarfield: jeff 06 has just submitted again, and nothing close to what i thought he was hiding xD 
 The_10x_Engineer: jeff 06?
 Astrobytes: Right so now you can tell us what you thought he was hiding :P
 Scarfield: basicly a blocker
 Stormalix: jeff 06?
 Scarfield: 1v1 get to CP hold CP from opp
 Stormalix: what
 Scarfield: its a username like The_10x_Engineer and Stormalix
 Stormalix: i know lol
 Astrobytes: Oh right. I use a bit of that still. But my bot is still currently very shit. Tomorrow problems :P
 Scarfield: tomorrow problems indeed
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: now that's what I call a push!
 darkhorse64: If you knew what my bot is doing, you would be surprised
 Astrobytes: I look forward to hearing about it
 jacek: how would he be surprise if he knew?
 Astrobytes: Surprised at the approach, not at the knowledge of him using that approach
 darkhorse64: ^
 struct: :thinking:
 Illedan: gg jft63
 Astrobytes: considerably good lead
 jacek: but quite heavy
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 Illedan: Love it jacek :D
 Astrobytes: he's on fire today
 Smelty: lots of collisions, astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/440734735">https://www.codingame.com/replay/440734735</a>
 Astrobytes: Smelty: Yes. Blocking the pods from reaching the checkpoints
 Smelty: hmm....maybe i should try that
 Astrobytes: Runner/blocker meta is quite well establish in CSB Smelty
 Astrobytes: *established
 Smelty: yea, currently mine just camps the next checkpoint
 Astrobytes: Which league Smelty?
 Smelty: gold, 2nd
 Astrobytes: OOf, very close
 Astrobytes: *Oof
 struct: which language are you using?
 Smelty: c++/java
 struct: You might want to try smitsimax then
 struct: its not needed to get out of gold
 Astrobytes: MC + mutation is enough for legend
 Astrobytes: Even just maths
 struct: I had 100% win rate on gold with 2 runners when I used smitsi
 Smelty: okay, thanks!
 Astrobytes: Nice struct
 Astrobytes: I guess the blocking behaviour emerges from that naturally
 struct: Well since the gold boss also has 2 runners it can predict quite well
 struct: at least I think it was 2 runners vs 2 runners
 Smelty: it is 
 Astrobytes: where did you end up with smitsi in CSB struct?
 struct: That version of 2 runners go top 150
 struct: after I changed thrust to 200
 struct: It was on an alt account
 struct: I never implemented runner + blocker on csb
 struct: I tried
 struct: but failed
 Astrobytes: I've always had a GA or some variant on CSB so I did
 Astrobytes: Gonna have to go back to Smitsi now I'm more experienced

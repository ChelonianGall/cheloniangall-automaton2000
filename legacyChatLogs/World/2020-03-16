 Gamebot: is this website not working properly now?
 Helasraizam: Don't think so, I'm stuck on "validating your program and computing score"
 Helasraizam: nm, guess it just took a while
 daffie: nah it's def taking a dump
 daffie: will be back later I guess
 SasiKing: Clash Games Aren't starting for me
 eulerscheZahl: that got reported alreadyi guess staff isn't back from weekend yet
 daffie: is the other stuff working yet&#160;?
 daffie: or still&#160;?
 MSmits: if you didn't, then that should be ok?
 MSmits: wow scrolling
 MSmits: so... good morning
 MSmits: I'm in the train, dodging corona virus while headed to work :P
 eulerscheZahl: you are supposed to climb the CG ranking MSmits
 MSmits: I am, 36 now, i was 42 when the ranking change happened
 MSmits: i'm just picking low pop multis so it is slow
 eulerscheZahl: i mean you were supposed to have 3 weeks off, so i expected you to play CGand now you have to help others with IT
 MSmits: ah yes, it's sad, but necessary
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't even a network admin or alike, that's totally different from coding
 MSmits: but i wont be at work often. Maybe once a week
 MSmits: i will be at work troubleshooting and helping students remotely, but still will have plenty of time to code
 eulerscheZahl: great
 eulerscheZahl: which game is the next?
 MSmits: Onitama
 MSmits: any advice?
 eulerscheZahl: another low populated game
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but i like it
 eulerscheZahl: i'm minimaxing
 MSmits: you
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if it's the best idea
 MSmits: 're almost always mm
 eulerscheZahl: or random search
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: but i think trictrac has a minimax too
 MSmits: i get discouraged to do mm
 MSmits: I can make it work, but its never better for me
 eulerscheZahl: feel free to find an awesome alternative how to tackle Onitama
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm struggling a bit with the board representation
 MSmits: trying to make it fast
 eulerscheZahl: rotating cards are weird
 MSmits: not even looking at that yet
 eulerscheZahl: was thinking a while how to even represent the board in the user input
 eulerscheZahl: namely the cards, all facing in one direction or rotating when given in the input or ...
 MSmits: hmm yes, are all the cards in the input sent to you as you would use them?
 MSmits: or as they get used by opponent?
 eulerscheZahl: the way the next player will use them
 MSmits: ok, so the input for them changes
 eulerscheZahl: so yours+neutral like you play themopponent like opponent plays them
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: last week tonight with a white wall and no audience looks so weird
 MSmits: havent seen it yet
 MSmits: but all those shows are weird with no audience
 MSmits: Seth Meyers was visibly insecure about whether his jokes were funny
 MSmits: they were of course
 MSmits: some comments were funny
 MSmits: "Don't worry Seth, I laughed at all the appropriate times"
 karliso: Transposition tables would be useless in a game like onitama?
 MSmits: oh noes
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely watch seth meyers
 MSmits: karliso&#160;!
 MSmits: hi&#160;:)
 MSmits: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like the beginning of a fight
 karliso: Hi, I still haven't wrapped my head around minimax.
 MSmits: transposition tables might have a use karliso
 MSmits: but the turn timer is an issue
 MSmits: there are many repeated states I think with the only difference being the turn counter
 karliso: But in onitama there are little to no transpositions because cards change.
 MSmits: so will you consider them identical or not?
 MSmits: cards change of course, but there are not that many possible configs of the 5 cards I think
 eulerscheZahl: the cards make a big difference
 eulerscheZahl: you need some search depth to get repeating patterns
 MSmits: yeah, I suspect transpositions are not worth it
 karliso: Cool, that is what I thought too.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just guessing too, didn't test it myself
 MSmits: btw, I think you can use variations of  mcts with eval everywhere you can use minimax, or almost everywhere. It's just more work I think
 MSmits: so if you dont want to minimax, you dont have to
 karliso: I feel like mxts has advantage of CG because you can reuse the search tree from previous turn.
 MSmits: there are ways to do this with minimax, but thats rarely worth it
 MSmits: I'm also not sure how much reusing the search tree helps with mcts. I'm sure it helps a bit, but you also fragment your nodes
 MSmits: as in. your nodes are scattered all over the pool
 karliso: Should negamax always be preferred over minimax?
 MSmits: so your memory cache gets a bit less efficient
 MSmits: karliso probably yes
 ThunderbirdOne: so MSmits, paid leave eh? :D
 MSmits: no, plenty of work =/
 MSmits: but will do most at home
 ThunderbirdOne: ah
 MSmits: i'm in the train now
 MSmits: off to work to explain to my colleagues how to work from home
 eulerscheZahl: turn on your PC, log in there, open that
 darkhorse64: I'm building a Onitama bot, too with bitboarding, treating the king position as a special case
 MSmits: yes, i was going to do that as well
 eulerscheZahl: nice, some new players
 ThunderbirdOne: i'm still at the office
 eulerscheZahl: so far only a hand full have really tried it
 MSmits: the thing is though, you can also just fit 4 guys with uint8_t[4] in the same amount of space
 ThunderbirdOne: but as far as i can see, there's about 5 other people on this floor&#160;:')
 darkhorse64: Not for me but not an alibi bot anymore
 eulerscheZahl: how many are there usually ThunderbirdOne?
 ThunderbirdOne: eeh, just my team is already about 7 i think
 ThunderbirdOne: and there's about 4 - 5 teams on this floor :p
 eulerscheZahl: and why did you go?`:P
 MSmits: he's the boss
 ThunderbirdOne: I really don't have a decent desk at home atm
 MSmits: or that
 ThunderbirdOne: and they're pouring the floor as well, so I can't walk on it for the next 5 days :p
 MSmits: great... dude coughing behind me
 MSmits: stay home ffs
 ThunderbirdOne: don't continue to work Smits, you'll just pass it on to all of your colleagues
 eulerscheZahl: if you get infected, you have 0 days a week to go to school
 MSmits: I'm ok so far
 ThunderbirdOne: that guy behind you though
 MSmits: this is true euler
 MSmits: he's stopped for now
 MSmits: i was in another carriage befoe
 MSmits: there was this 60 yr old woman telling another she just has a flu, no worries, then snorted in a paper handkerchief
 eulerscheZahl: aka tissue
 MSmits: so i changed carriages. Not gonna do that again
 MSmits: yes tissue, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, not getting any better
 eulerscheZahl: how far do you have it to your working place?
 MSmits: it's 35 min on train, then 20 min walk
 eulerscheZahl: i guess the bicycle is not an option then
 eulerscheZahl: too far
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: 2 hrs if i was fast, but i get knee prolems with too much cycling
 eulerscheZahl: and after 2h of doing sports i'm getting tiredwouldn't be helping either when you have to stand in front of a class
 MSmits: trying to cycle 2 hrs is a good test to see if you're infected with corona though :P
 MSmits: nah it wouldnt but thats something i wont be doing till at least 6th of april
 MSmits: just my colleagues there now
 eulerscheZahl: or hold your breath for 10s (you will get it when you watched last week tonight)
 MSmits: is that a different episode?
 MSmits: I saw a corona episode already
 ThunderbirdOne: yes, the hold your breath thing is just stupid
 eulerscheZahl: corono II
 eulerscheZahl: corona II
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: holding breath doesnt make sense even
 MSmits: because you wont get oxygen with or without corona when you hold your breath
 dbdr: it's not about avoiding to catch it :D
 dbdr: it's a way to test the state of your lungs
 MSmits: I guess
 ThunderbirdOne: coughing within 10 seconds could mean multiple things though
 MSmits: by the time you detect it that way, there'd be plenty of ways
 MSmits: just try a flight of stairs
 ThunderbirdOne: flatten the curve
 ThunderbirdOne: stay home
 dbdr: it might actually be useful earlier
 ThunderbirdOne: did you guys see that article with the "simulations"&#160;?
 MSmits: no, link it&#160;!
 dbdr: you climbs stairs more frequently than hold your breath for 10s
 ThunderbirdOne: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fgraphics%2f2020%2fworld%2fcorona-simulator%2f">https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fgraphics%2f2020%2fworld%2fcorona-simulator%2f</a>
 MSmits: btw, I am teaching a simulating/modelling class, for several years now, it starts in 1 week and the first subject is a flu epidemic
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: pay wall
 dbdr: maybe you reached the limiit?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i got it
 eulerscheZahl: clicked "free" and accepted their ToS
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah
 MSmits: thanks for link, it;s really interesting. I knew all that, but good to show others
 dbdr: looks a bit like PCR
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: since they all have the same size, they bounce :D
 ThunderbirdOne: hehe, i just like the visualisation
 MSmits: btw, train arriving, ttyl, looking forward to onitama!
 ThunderbirdOne: it makes it so much easier to comprehend
 ThunderbirdOne: and also easier to explain the whole "flatten the curve" thing
 dbdr: yes, it's a good one
 eulerscheZahl: the simulation reminds me of CSB days
 eulerscheZahl: when people were building game engines
 dbdr: something else than bots?
 eulerscheZahl: engine for their botsbefore your time on CG
 eulerscheZahl: sethorizer, SwagColoredKitten, MK, lurkin, ...
 eulerscheZahl: TheSauce
 eulerscheZahl: so many lost membersbut some other cool people joined
 ThunderbirdOne: what happened to Swaggy anyway?
 eulerscheZahl: no diea
 eulerscheZahl: idea
 DragonS: why won't my code submit? all the test are okay
 dbdr: was the referee secret?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: I think submits are broken DragonS
 DragonS:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: reported already
 dbdr: temporarily
 DragonS: okay thx
 eulerscheZahl: staff (thibaud) reacted with :eyes: so he saw it
 dbdr: master Thubault move&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: Thubault?
 dbdr: Thiibault
 dbdr: Typo
 dbdr: by the way, did you know there was a language called TypoScript?
 dbdr: and that's not a typo :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: esoteric language i guess
 dbdr: no. for TYPO3, a CMS
 dbdr: I actually saw TYPO3 in a list of CMS I was considering for that chat log site
 dbdr: but did not install it
 dbdr: an esoteric language where you need to make typo sounds fun though :D
 ThunderbirdOne: ah CMS systems... i have a love/hate relationship with them
 dbdr: I used Drupal many years ago
 ThunderbirdOne: worked with Umbraco, Sitecore and ...
 dbdr: turns out it's probably still a good choice if you want to program your own modules
 ThunderbirdOne: another one that i've forgotten the name of&#160;:')
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: never heard of those
 ThunderbirdOne: used to work at an agency that just built content sites for customers
 ThunderbirdOne: so it was CMS non-sotp
 ThunderbirdOne: they're all .NET CMS systems
 dbdr: ah OK. open-source?
 ThunderbirdOne: umbraco is
 dbdr: a lot of what I saw was php
 ThunderbirdOne: the other ones not
 dbdr: including Drupal and MediaWiki
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, my php colleagues would primarily use Drupal or Wordpress
 ThunderbirdOne: and then if they would do custom stuff, that would be done with
 ThunderbirdOne: aaah, shit.. what was that framework called
 ThunderbirdOne: symfony!
 dbdr: heard that name&#160;:)
 ThunderbirdOne: that's about as far as it went for me too
 DragonS: okay submit works now
 dbdr: cool, thanks for the info DragonS!
 DragonS:&#160;:)
 DragonS: but i did now get any exp and stuff for the solution

 Scarfield: it was&#160;:)

 Automaton2000: automaton2000, convert it to the nearest wreck
 AntiSquid: UTG successfully converted into a wreck
 farzher: why is clash of code 15min when it says flash is 5min
 Scarfield: For SmitsiMax in CSB, should I eval the pods entirely seperate, or would it help also including a combined eval for both pods of each player?
 Scarfield: so instead of each pod searching for its own optimal series of actions, there will be an added element of team play
 Astrobytes: Separately iiuc, cooperative behaviour will emerge naturally where optimal
 struct: I cant remember
 struct: ping MSmits
 Scarfield: yea it says so in his article, but i remember him mentioning he changed something since writing it, and i thought it might help.
 jacek: you want to summon tee MSmits?
 jacek: Yavalath!
 Scarfield: lol&#160;:)
 Scarfield: 2 2 is the best starting pos
 Scarfield: should be easy enough to test i suppose - "just" need to code the smitsimax part :p
 MSmits: huh, what?
 struct: he wants to know
 struct: if he should add coop to eval on CSB
 struct: for smitsimax
 MSmits: mmh coop. My eval is not the best, but the travelled distance of the runner is part of the blocker eval, in my case
 MSmits: so I guess that's coop
 MSmits: and also the travelled distance of the opponents runner (as a negative modifier)\
 MSmits: also, what I changed was:
 MSmits: I stopped doing the dynamic normalization
 MSmits: my exploration parameter is supposed to fix everything, including the score normalization
 MSmits: the thing is, if your scores are betwen -1 and 1, then an exploration parameter of somewhere between 1 and 1,5 is ok
 MSmits: if your scores are between -100 and +100, then an exploration parameter of 100 to 150 does exactly the same thing
 MSmits: so just experiment with that and find the right parameter
 struct: so are you saying your eval is between 1 and -1?
 MSmits: oh and a score range of -100 to +100 is exactly identical to a score range between 10300 and 10500
 MSmits: no it's not struct
 MSmits: I'm saying it doesnt have to be
 MSmits: it can be anything, just fit the exploration parameter appropriately
 MSmits: for uttt the scores are between -1 and 1, but it doesnt have to be either
 MSmits: if in uttt, your loss score is 94 and your win score is 96 and your parameter is 1, then it will play *exactly* the same game as when your loss score is -1 and your win score is +1 and the parameter is 1
 MSmits: it is stupid to choose a score range like that, but it will have no effect on your bot
 MSmits: maybe you would lose a tiny bit of performance due to the loss of efficiency, negating a win/loss is cheaper if it is -1 or +1, but its probably negligible
 MSmits: since, in CSB it is very inconvenient to try and fit scores between -1 and 1, I suggest you dont even try. It's not necessary
 struct: I will have to try
 struct: I think I have an idea
 MSmits: why
 j-nila: what
 struct: Not -1 and 1
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: i think i know what you do
 struct: Ill try and see if thats it
 MSmits: it's no secret, if you ask me I will just tell you
 struct: Well if its no secret
 MSmits: I'll never share whole bots, but I'm pretty open about most things
 MSmits: if you dont want to throw everything on world chat, you can also just pm and ask
 j-nila: how do i remove this join us on discord thing
 j-nila: help
 MSmits: I click the cross and then most of it is gone
 MSmits: still a small bar I guess
 struct: ublock origin
 struct: and block it
 yfprojects: there is an arrow pointing upwards
 MSmits: oh yeah that arrow
 struct: M Smits Ill pm you after I try it and if it doesnt work
 struct: I won't need it right now anyways
 struct: Just remember need to fix avx collision search with checkpoints
 MSmits: sure, I'll write a response. PM is easier because I can do it asynchronously
 MSmits: brb prime minister addressing the nation
 AntiSquid: wow :o
 AntiSquid: totally need to watch it live, it's not the same if you watch the rebroadcast of the PM
 MSmits: last time was in the 70s, it's pretty unique
 MSmits: was a good speech
 MSmits: basically explaining what the next few months are gonna be like as far as he knows
 Scarfield: I have finished the sim for CSB, and was wondering about how to do the eval, I saw your comments, and actually thought having a designated runner/blocker wouldnt be the best approach for smitsimax?
 MSmits: maybe it isn't, it's just what i have
 MSmits: i do designate a runner during eval
 MSmits: so every time a pod receives score, it might have a different role
 MSmits: I know Robo does this differently for example
 Scarfield: ah okay, makes sense
 MSmits: I think he designates runner and blocker at the start of the turn
 MSmits: that also works
 MSmits: many variations are possible
 MSmits: same as the moves you allow
 MSmits: many players allow shielding in deeper layers of the search
 Scarfield: i figured the runner/blokcer role would emerge from the search, but feel like i should maybe "enforce" team play a bit, will just have to play with it i guess
 MSmits: my bot only does shield as a first move during the search (so depth 0 in the current turn) and after that it is not allowed
 MSmits: yes, just experiment
 MSmits: one big thing is how you prune moves
 MSmits: I think my bot does well because there are many move sequences I dont allow
 Scarfield: havent decided what to do about shields yet, but that seems like an easy start to prune - the shield depth 0 i mean
 MSmits: basically it is like this
 MSmits: a search for a pod, is maybe 7 moves in a row
 MSmits: and each pod has its own 7 moves
 MSmits: i dont allow the following
 MSmits: 1) power 0, turn right
 MSmits: 2) power 0, turn left
 MSmits: that's completely pointless and increases branching
 MSmits: be careful about doing this sort of thing while on full power, alternating turns (left/right) might be useful with full power
 MSmits: catching a quick checkpoint on the edge of the pod etc.
 MSmits: but on 0 power, alternating turns is useless
 MSmits: at least in smitsimax, on minimax it would be different
 MSmits: smitsimax is an incoherent search, you dont directly respond to the opponent, so alternating turns cannot serve as a response
 Scarfield: was just about to mention i saw Pens pods do that, but he is using minimax iirc, makes sense it wouldnt work with the incohence
 MSmits: there are several move combinations like this, that are useless 
 MSmits: right, since, during the search the move is only chosen based on UCB1
 MSmits: and not on the opponent choice in that particular rollout
 Scarfield: yea, but the pruning will have to wait a bit, still only just finished the sim, but its nice with some input&#160;:)
 MSmits: of course, the net result over many rollouts does lead to a response to the opponent, but there is no use keeping useless move sequences 
 MSmits: good luck&#160;:)
 Scarfield: ty, btw didnt you mention that you reduced your depth?
 MSmits: from 8 to 7
 MSmits: but it depends on many things
 MSmits: I suspect that if i had an avx sim, it would be 8 or 9
 MSmits: just fit the parameter
 MSmits: start with 7, it's a good value to start with, can always try different ones
 MSmits: integer params are super easy to fit
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: My collision search is working fine
 struct: but the apply is not
 MSmits: apply move?
 struct: apply collision
 struct: like bounce
 MSmits: ah you mean you have the collision time
 struct: yes
 MSmits: i could share my function, but you use avx, so thats completely different
 struct: yeah
 struct: Without avx it works 
 Ducknaro: hi

 MSmits: 33/47 students in my physics class signed up so far, going well&#160;:)

 MSmits: I will call their parents
 MSmits: but i didnt say that yet
 struct: and they will have to play Yavalath
 MSmits: that would be a reward struct
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, you can do that with minors
 MSmits: yes, most of them are, not all
 MSmits: 17 is the median age of my students

 735487: who knows why getting toilet paper so many is important? do i need to go and get it also?
 JBM: you need to configure your client properly
 735487: why people in many countries do that?
 Astrobytes: amurushkin greed? stupidity?
 amurushkin: I just lazy to type nickname ofter after reconnects
 Scarfield: saw someone say it gives people some sort of feeling of being in control of the situation, but yea
 Astrobytes: I think it started with a rumour about toilet paper being manufactured in Wuhan
 amurushkin: Astrobytes: I think so but who knows. maybe i dont know something
 AntiSquid: when you have no pasta left to buy, you gotta make spaghetti out of something else /s
 AntiSquid: toilet paper is white and al dente
 amurushkin: really? such paper manufactured in many cities at my country
 Scarfield: multi bene
 JBM: just use soap and water, it actually works better
 Astrobytes: amurushkin Yes of course, it was just fake news
 amurushkin: ok i understand now
 Scarfield: yea the french had this correct all along :p
 JBM: not quite sure how this is related to the french
 Astrobytes: Bidets?
 AntiSquid: this is the only scenario i can think of where you really need a lot of toilet paper: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE-X-FKYndI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE-X-FKYndI</a>
 Scarfield: this "foreign" danish comedian was like, wtf danes, if you got shit on your stomach, would you just wipe it of with some paper, and think it is clean?
 JBM: are bidets a french thing?
 AntiSquid: but it's for a stupid prank 
 Scarfield: and yea bidets was my point
 Astrobytes: I think so JBM
 Scarfield: i think it is french yea
 JBM: it's more of an "old people thing" to me
 Astrobytes: I'll never forget the first time I was confronted with a bidet
 eulerscheZahl: it's an anagram for bitset
 JBM: you could just have ignored it as much as it ignored you
 JBM: or use it as a poop stool
 Astrobytes: I did. Once I found out it was for washing my arse I was mightily put off
 AntiSquid: aren't bidets just to comfort the bumhole? 
 AntiSquid: french still buy toilet roll no?
 JBM: sure
 AntiSquid: of course you do
 JBM: and the not-roll variety, depending on your roo; equipment
 AntiSquid: here is proof:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6hvDiAx3ho">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6hvDiAx3ho</a>
 AntiSquid: french raid toilet rolls in supermarket&#160;! 
 AntiSquid: therefore the bidet is used for something else
 JBM: some did yeah
 JBM: including at my nearest supermarket
 JBM: as zuck would've put it
 JBM: "dumb fucks"
 AntiSquid: who is zuck?
 Astrobytes: My local is empty too, so I'm told, since I can't leave the house for another 7 days
 JBM: some startup guy
 Astrobytes: The AntiChrist you say?
 AntiSquid: can only think of mark zuckerberg
 AntiSquid: but that guy looks dead inside
 JBM: that would be the correct one
 Astrobytes: He needs some gold paint
 JBM: another nice ref

 eulerscheZahl: "I can't leave the house for another 7 days"what did I miss? are you infected?
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've been isolating for a week now
 Astrobytes: Infected with something at least, feels like bad 'flu
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 AntiSquid: so did you code a bot during this time Astrobytes&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: feeling better already?
 AntiSquid: i would .
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've been working on stuff
 Astrobytes: No I feel like shit, to put it mildly
 AntiSquid: i need to stay extra to assist with some stuff regarding this corona virus circus
 Astrobytes: Sleeping a lot, can't stand up for longer than a few mins
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, sounds like a flu
 eulerscheZahl: i hate that feeling
 Astrobytes: Have a dry cough and chest is a bit heavy but nothing to worry about so far
 eulerscheZahl: what feels weird to me: we have a flu that's dangerous to a small percentage (as in deadly), get we take a lot of actions against it
 eulerscheZahl: at the same time: climate change? we can't risk losing our jobs
 Astrobytes: I know right, seriously
 AntiSquid: probably it's about how immediate the treat appears to be
 Astrobytes: Action on climate change would make a lot of incredibly wealthy people a bit less wealthy, and loosen their grip
 Astrobytes: They only care about short-term as Squiddy says
 jaecode: less planes flying from virus = climate change action&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: less cars too
 AntiSquid: i mean cars on the road, not flying cars although we all expect them i bet
 jaecode: hey do we lose points if we use a hint on the practice puzzles?
 jaecode: I
 struct: no
 AntiSquid: what points would you lose?
 AntiSquid: what hints are you refering to&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, but make sure you learn something from them and don't just blindly use them
 jaecode: in the challenges there is a hint button, too scared to press it
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle hints in the easy section
 jaecode: I passed like 5 of them without using hints at all...
 AntiSquid: always aggressively press hint
 eulerscheZahl: these hints only exist for the very first introduction puzzles
 jaecode: oh ok good to know
 jaecode: just wanted to get some practice in on this site since I got an interviewer request to complete it for a job... never used this system before
 Astrobytes: There's a sample test on the site no?
 Astrobytes: So you know the format
 jaecode: is there?
 Astrobytes: There used to be one on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work">https://www.codingame.com/work</a>
 Astrobytes: Maybe they changed it, they've been working on that side of things for a while now
 jaecode: Thanks, I'll check it out. Since all they sent me was a link that starts it with 100 minutes to complete. 
 icecream17: At <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/codingame-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/codingame-sponsored-contest</a> I only output 'A' but it passed all the tests
 Astrobytes: Well, definitely brush up on any areas you might be lacking in within the puzzle section before you do it, and good luck jaecode
 jaecode: will do
 Astrobytes: icecream17 It's an optimisation puzzle, so you have to try to optimise your score
 icecream17: oh i see
 icecream17: wow interesting. okay bye

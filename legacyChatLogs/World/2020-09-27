 DaNinja: click Ranking in your profile
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, i managed to exit the loop
 eulerscheZahl: don't dofor (int i = 0; i &lt;= intMax; i++)
 jacek: but did you exit while loop

 JackTheRipper18: Why doesn't the AI pod racing game thing actually play, it's just frozen
 Lonlon: this happens from time to time, press the button play your code to upload your code and then reload the page
 JackTheRipper18: How do you upload?
 Lonlon: the button used to run your code also uploads it, cuz if you reload the page without pressing it before your changes to the last uploaded version of your code will be lost
 ChillChilling: I  didn't know how to solve pod racing:innocent:
 JackTheRipper18: Which pod racing?
 JackTheRipper18: My setup became a clusterfuck(idk if I can say that here) so I'm quickly rewriting.
 JackTheRipper18: nestled if's on nestled if's it was such a hastle to add support for new mechanics.
 JackTheRipper18: it was p fast tho
 ChillChilling: I even didn't konw what's the command of the cop racing( the first puzzle in AI)
 JackTheRipper18: You just had to replace Y with X.
 ChillChilling: Okkkk,...hhhh 
 JackTheRipper18: what lang r u doing it in out of curiosity.
 ChillChilling: C 
 JackTheRipper18: C/C++?
 ChillChilling: yep
 JackTheRipper18: which one?
 JackTheRipper18: C or C++
 ChillChilling: C
 JackTheRipper18: ah im doing C++.
 ChillChilling: to be honset, I have worked for more one year, but practicing in English platform is very hard for me. Even cant understand the description
 ChillChilling: Perseverance Prevails:joy:
 CopperFr: You would prefer to practice in French&#160;?
 Jianwei: hello, everybody
 ChillChilling: In fact, I am iChinese. EN is better.hhh
 ChillChilling: Hi jianwei 大兄弟
 jacek: oO
 Umer_J: hi everyone
 arschsaft: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 CopperFr: EN is better than FR&#160;???
 AntiSquid: you can change language in settings 
 AntiSquid: and yes english is better than french otherwise we would speak french in world chat, well not better, but it became the norm at some point
 CopperFr: probably but i'm better in french than in english
 JBM: just wait till CN because the norm
 JBM: *becomes whoa wake up jbm
 jacek: jaceklang will be the norm
 JoeDaCoder: What do i do?
 MadKnight: u code
 MadKnight: obviously
 JBM: What do you code? ur CSB, more specifically
 Thyl: Hello
 Thyl: is there any technique other than nested Monte Carlo for SameGame?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a beam search
 eulerscheZahl: not that successful though&#160;:(
 Thyl: You're 3
 Thyl:&#160;:)
 DomiKo: You can do a lot of things I guess
 TBali: Hehe, bot leaderboards are kinda unstable... I resubmited my bots to check the tags.  1400 CP goodbye 
 TBali: greedy algorithm didnt' work for me
 DomiKo: you resubmited all of them?
 TBali: not at once, but in 3 batches during a day. total of 30. But only 8 of them are over 1000CPs, rest are basic heuristics without much tought or time spent.
 TBali: interestingly, all of thm lost ranking. I thought in the average + and - will be averagded to 0
 sid12123: i am an imposter
 Thyl: ok
 TBali: maybe if a bot is in the arena for a long time, it gets pushed upwards eventually
 TBali: But upon resubmit it can be stuck at a lower ranking.
 TBali: Especially if gameplay strategies work againt each other rock-paper-scissors like 
 DomiKo: you can resubmit some of them
 DomiKo: and see what happend
 TBali: yeah, it was very fluctuating also during contest
 TBali: but that time scenery was dynamic, everebody developed their bot and submited frequently. Multiplayer arenas are much more static, most bots are there unchanged for a long time
 DomiKo: some games are very random
 DomiKo: and some of them have 1K+ people in one level
 DomiKo: and your score could change if you luckly win first 10 games
 TBali: yes, maybe I resubmit only the Gold+ bots. For Bronze it deas not really matter
 TBali: *does
 DomiKo: yap
 qsassy: im new
 qsassy: how do u do a new case without deleting the 1st one
 MadKnight: u have to do them all with the same code
 MadKnight: jbm stopthat
 MadKnight: srsly
 eulerscheZahl: stop what?
 MadKnight: it's from #fr
 eulerscheZahl: typing in the chat starts lagging when I have a 3.5k frame replay open&#160;:(
 MadKnight: so i made a mistake and they keep making fun of what i did 2+ years ago
 jacek: when i played 2048 extensively i had the tetris effect from that
 jacek: i saw 2 identical cars and wanted them to merge into bigger one
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl your cgfunge has been giving me fits.  i overcomplicated the hell out of it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I still can't do #s over 8100
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :flip:
 eulerscheZahl: #s?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: numbers
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 JBM: whoa
 JBM: wouldn't have read it either
 eulerscheZahl: you need to optimize your algo a bit. you're obviously not doing trial division from 2 to n anymore&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i think i only check 2 and all odd numbers till sqrt(n)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, doing that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but sqrt(10000)=100 loops
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i get 91
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how dbdr did so well is beyond me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ill resub in a minute, but no 100%
 PatrickMcGinnisII: second time around i actually computed the sqrt instead of i*i
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i overcomplicate everything
 eulerscheZahl: hardcoding unfortunately&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: 100 testcases aren't enough to prevent that. he's not factoring the numbers
 eulerscheZahl: but i think some solutions around 20k-25k are legit
 eulerscheZahl: using a list of all primes below 100
 eulerscheZahl: you can load numbers in string mode btw
 eulerscheZahl: "a" is a 97
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, i thought of that. still wierd tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe next time around
 jacek: what about those probability prime number tests? would they be faster?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: determining odd/even is easy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: getting the sqrt has a couple methods
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but u don't have to do either really
 jacek: i*i &lt;= n?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, easiest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: actually i think its more like i*i&gt;n then its prime
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, 86%
 eulerscheZahl: miller-rabin is deterministic with just testing 2 in that range
 eulerscheZahl: there's a mersenne prime below 10000 (2047) but that's not a testcase
 eulerscheZahl: that's what robo is doing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the random ones and the log2 tests are just too out therre for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think i got it figured out, it's just not as intuitive as i was hoping, you need no where near 40x30 chars
 eulerscheZahl: my solution is like 12x7
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if it only worked for 2^77,232,917 -1 tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 jacek: so, almost million deaths from covid :tada:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my gf is still paranoid AF, she's a teacher... I'm sick of the politics
 AntiSquid: happy sunday gunday (getting this message every sunday from my american contacts on social media)
 jacek: caturday?
 AntiSquid: only see that on CG (caturday)
 jacek: i span this on irc as well
 eulerscheZahl: how do you span it?<span>Caturday</span>?
 Washier: hehe
 eulerscheZahl: happy Punday :P
 AntiSquid: with a spanner of course
 TBali: 4th Punic war?
 eulerscheZahl: no, Carthago is down already
 TBali: Salted like a good hash
 mortadha: hello world
 mortadha: hi
 ils: CoC captcha page is not loading properly. I have tried it in firefox, chrome, opera, and edge
 ils: please help
 AntiSquid: lay off the CoC
 AntiSquid: have some fun for a change
 Brevis: captcha page?
 eulerscheZahl: you'll only see it when playing a lot of clashes in a short time
 Brevis: oh, ok
 AntiSquid: and even then you need to really spam the clashes . i mean i've done my clash achivements and quests and only got them around 100th clash or so ... that's excessive amount anyway, there got to be more fun stuff to do
 AntiSquid: only got the captchas after 100 clashes i mean
 Brevis: That's impressive
 ils: i got it after 17 clashes
 mortadha: That's impressive
 mortadha: hello world
 jrke: can i get refree for CSB
 jrke:&#160;?
 Brevis: what is CSB?
 eulerscheZahl: coders strike back
 jrke: ^
 eulerscheZahl: check SpiritusSancti5 on github
 jrke: oke
 Brevis: oh, what's that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Spiritus Sancti...that's what you say before you try to give your cat a bath
 jrke: CSB is a bot programming.
 Brevis: ok
 mortadha: hello world
 mortadha: who is heres
 Brevis: hello mortadha
 mortadha: i have a problem you can help me
 mortadha: Brevis
 Brevis: what is the problem?
 eulerscheZahl: I never tried to bath my cat. wouldn't end well I think
 mortadha: i have a bad level in data structure
 mortadha: Brevis
 mortadha: please i need to help
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hence the little prayer eulerscheZahl&#160;;)  hehe\
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a reason to give her a bath
 mortadha: i don't understand
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cats usually hate baths, good way to piss off the little killers
 mortadha: i have a bad level in data structures
 mortadha: who can help me
 mortadha: please 
 mortadha:&#160;????
 mortadha:&#160;????
 Allis: Do you have internet?
 mortadha: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mortadha no one knows puzzle or what level you speak of
 mortadha: who knows best website to learn programming with python
 mortadha: or cpp or c or javascript
 mortadha:&#160;????
 mortadha:&#160;????
 2ndwolf: I think w3schools has all of those
 mortadha: hi 
 mortadha: you don't another
 mortadha: for algorithms
 mortadha: i have a bad level in algorithms who can help me please
 mortadha: :nerd:
 mortadha: :hugging:
 SPDene: trywhile True:
 2ndwolf: genius
 mortadha: who knows best website to learn algorithms
 PatrickMcGinnisII: while (level&gt;&gt;1);
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google algorithms
 mortadha: i will try
 mortadha: and try 
 mortadha: until success
 mortadha: while(1) {level++;}
 mortadha: d
 mortadha: sorry
 mortadha: so sorry
 mortadha: hello world
 mortadha: who is here
 Aditya_08: I come from an R Programming background, love this concept of learning coding by gamification:relaxed:
 jacek: is R programming language?
 jacek: whats next? HTML?
 eulerscheZahl: only in combination with CSS
 MadKnight: Automaton2000  are u a programming language&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you need to run a meta mcts for uttt
 jacek: thats so smits
 jacek: again, i joined into some number channel
 jacek: meh, when people lose against me in oware i lose pts o.o
 Astrobytes: jacek, random chat windows with some random number?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: and its loading
 Astrobytes: Yup, been happening to me for a few weeks randomly
 JBM: like, for as long as you've been clashing
 Astrobytes: I haven't clashed in years
 jacek: this is not clash, channel tab is number, it doesnt start with cock
 jacek: coc*
 Astrobytes: "cock", nicely put
 Astrobytes: Reported it on discord btw
 jacek: sorry, autocorrect
 LegendaryStone: lol
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi
 Uljahn: external clients let you use your user id i guess
 Astrobytes: but there's nothing in the tab, just "loading" forever
 eulerscheZahl: it happens that i close chats and they open again
 eulerscheZahl: but showing the user ID instead of nickname
 eulerscheZahl: those number chats are direct mesages
 eulerscheZahl: messages even
 Astrobytes: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: next time you get a number chat, just write "who are you?" :D
 Astrobytes: It never displays anything other than "Loading", never tried typing
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i'm not sure if i even opened them now that i'm thinking about it
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi eulerscheZahl hru
 eulerscheZahl: not i'm pretty sure there's a connection between having private messages and these random channels
 eulerscheZahl: hi EugenioToshiAmato
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think you're right
 ToshiTuringMachine: The new Quest Map is so cool
 DomiKo: is cool for like 10 minutes
 DomiKo: then you forget about it
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: having a contest is cool
 ToshiTuringMachine: oh no I have 4/5 upvotes on my contribution
 eulerscheZahl: still 1.5 months to wait
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: that's so loooong
 Astrobytes: man, that's ages 
 DomiKo: Is there any reason why now we have 4 contests per year?
 eulerscheZahl: is that 5 upvotes for a single contribution or for all of them combined?
 ToshiTuringMachine: dunno
 eulerscheZahl: creating contests is some work to do
 ToshiTuringMachine: i guess total
 DomiKo: Back then there was a lot of it
 eulerscheZahl: some background <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-contests-whats-next/133924">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-contests-whats-next/133924</a>
 ToshiTuringMachine: I think codingame expected the site to go viral while we are always no more than 1000 people on contest. 
 Astrobytes:  was too much of a workload on the staff, they're not a particularly large company in terms of people
 eulerscheZahl: so all we can do: wait for the next official contest or propose a completely finished and polished game for the possible chance of getting it as a contest
 eulerscheZahl: creating such a game is a lot of effort for an unknown outcome
 ToshiTuringMachine: but if you propose it you cannot compete :P
 Astrobytes: will yours be an actual contest euler?
 shwerpy: hi
 Schwase: yeah it sounds like theyre ok with that
 Astrobytes: or just unofficial?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know
 eulerscheZahl: if it will, then around January
 Schwase: unofficial is a great suggestion
 Astrobytes: We had an unofficial one with a brand new game Schwase, BitRunner 2048
 Astrobytes: Was fun
 Astrobytes: The unofficial ones with existing multis are kinda fun, but there's nothing like getting a new game 
 jacek: 2048 again eh
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: and now i have 2 tabs with world
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 jacek: but nothing much on the other world
 eulerscheZahl: we are the world
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/as4p3Q2.png">https://i.imgur.com/as4p3Q2.png</a>
 Uljahn: could be me trying to pm jacek from pidgin&#160;:/
 jacek: huh
 jacek: did you see that hmm?
 Uljahn: i've closed pidgin already&#160;:(
 490588: oh that was psi+ not pidgin
 Uljahn: now i see world(2) too (after ctrl+f5)
 jacek: but do you see what i write there
 Uljahn: no
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/j95wqgV.png">https://i.imgur.com/j95wqgV.png</a>
 jacek: you broke the chat then
 derjack: eeyup
 DomiKo: CG chat go brrrrrr
 jacek: 2 days till penguins approval or not
 Astrobytes: I like that game, I've not had time to write a proper bot for it. Or do anything else for that matter 
 eulerscheZahl: jacek can you leave the new world channel? or even the real #world?
 JBM: or even just #fantasy?
 Bixmox: How did you guys do the BOOST on Coders Strike Back?
 Bixmox: I feel like my current solution is a bit bad
 jacek: i closed the tab and refreshed and its gone
 omid_bushehr: hi
 AntiSquid: hi omid_bushehr
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 say hello
 Automaton2000: you are not using the same algorithm
 scareware047: bad Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i mean in the ide
 scareware047: ok fair enough Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: invalid paste id, perhaps it expired?"

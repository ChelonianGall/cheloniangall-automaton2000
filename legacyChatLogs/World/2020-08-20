 markyy: why do you want to disable the intellisense
 Gorbit99: it's not just me, basically most people want to in certain cases
 Gorbit99: especially coc players
 Gorbit99: it blocks your keypresses and sometimes makes you insert random stuff you didn't want
 WINWINWIN: Like when you use python, name a variable p
 WINWINWIN: then when you press enter to go for next line, suddenly its print
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: hi
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: why do I have a weird random name like this
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: lol
 Gorbit99: Seems like cg is randomly generating names if you didn't set one up yet
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: i already have an acc but im too lazy to log in
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: guess im the noiseless dictator for now
 Gorbit99: WINWINWIN exactly, I believe in ruby it's something like q or s or whatever creating a 20 character long thingy
 Gorbit99: no, you're NoiseLessDictator e4c4
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4:&#160;:)
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: no im NoiselessDictator_e4c4
 Gorbit99: sure, but I didn't want to highlight the message for you
 tutubalin: when I worked on CGFunge problem, editor always wanted to add &lt;?php
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: Gorbit99 .
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: whaz
 tutubalin: Gorbit99 how did you manage to disable autocomplete?
 tutubalin: also, is it still available with Ctrl+Space?
 Gorbit99: I made a forum post about it, but in short, I called a function incorrectly, setting the autocomplete provider for null (gotta love js) and making each call relying on it afterwards invalid
 Gorbit99: I believe it isn't
 Gorbit99: I also made a tampermonkey script btw, you can install it if you go to the forum post
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: whats your favourite coding language
 Gorbit99: depends, for what purpose?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: idk lets say for websites
 Gorbit99: I don't code websites
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: what do u code then
 Gorbit99: actual programs and challenges here
 Gorbit99: my actual main lang is C++, but I code in ruby on here
 Gorbit99: tutubalin to answer your question, you can p
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: (gotta love js) did u mean javascript
 Gorbit99: tutubalin to answer your question, you can bring up the popup, but it will be completely empty
 Gorbit99: yeah, and I meant it sarcastically
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: oh ok
 Gorbit99: I called a function with no arguments, that usually takes 2
 Gorbit99: because javascript can't have errors, otherwise it will suck
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: ok
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: im currently learning html, css, js, java, linux
 Gorbit99: that's a lot to learn all at once
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: i mean i go to school which has them as a subject
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: oh and php i think is coming next year
 Gorbit99: ahhh, I'll be learning java next semester
 Gorbit99: "learning"
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: i hate java tbh
 Gorbit99: I'll be teaching java to my classmates after the class completely fails them
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: im more like a js guy
 Gorbit99: only thing I ever used it for is minecraft spigot plugins&#160;:)
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: sameee
 Gorbit99: but if you want to write games for codingame, you have to use it
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: yeah ik
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: im so bad tho 
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: i feel like server programming and websites are a lot easier for me
 jrke: i am trying bender 2 i have doubt in starting the bender is in room 0 right
 jrke: or in room[0]
 A.Safarkhon: hallo
 A.Safarkhon: chi=o;jknsdjcjsd
 jacek: indeed
 jrke: yeah certificates&#160;:)&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: certs don't value much though in my experience
 AntiSquid: either degree for entry level or have projects / on the job experience matters a lot
 jrke: are they useful for me cause im in 9th standard so maybe it will be helpful for me
 AntiSquid: i guess? it shows you have interest ... guess it's good if you look for work experience / internship&#160;?
 tobk: Those certificates feel kind of out-of-place, IMHO (not only visually as they only fill the left side of the home page)
 CyberLemonade: what is the deal with the certifications?
 WINWINWIN: Show that we like computers?
 AntiSquid: you can skip school now CyberLemonade, congratulations on your achievements
 WINWINWIN: :P
 CyberLemonade: weeeeee
 WINWINWIN: CBSE CyberLemonade?
 CyberLemonade: ISC
 AggYzz: guys what is the best way to get the middle of a list
 AggYzz: like the expression
 wlesavo: is it a general discussion or CG come up with certifiates?
 CyberLemonade: they did
 CyberLemonade: in the home screen
 AntiSquid: int(len(2)/2)  ? AggYzz
 c0nc4c: anyone have experience on this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/dungeons-and-maps">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/dungeons-and-maps</a>
 AntiSquid: lent(list) *
 wlesavo: cant find on site, hm
 AntiSquid: geez can't type
 AggYzz: lel
 CyberLemonade: wlesavo home page
 AggYzz: what if the list is odd
 CyberLemonade: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/home">https://www.codingame.com/home</a>
 CyberLemonade: AggYzz odd lists have a centre
 CyberLemonade: evens don't
 AggYzz: i meant of ot os even
 CyberLemonade: then what do you want? average of both or any one?
 wlesavo: oh, ok, ctrl+f5 solves the problem, had an old version of home page
 AntiSquid: +1 / -1 AggYzz adjust according to prefefences
 AggYzz: ok
 AggYzz: ty
 CyberLemonade: lemme quickly apply to MIT using these certificates
 WINWINWIN: :D IIT is the main issue now, I thought that you were one of the poor guys stuck
 CyberLemonade: well I'm not giving IIT
 CyberLemonade: got KVPY
 jrke: wow kvpy nice....
 CyberLemonade: ty
 WINWINWIN: which science?
 CyberLemonade: maths or comp
 WINWINWIN: Maths then no ISI?
 CyberLemonade: yeah I'm giving ISI and CMI
 WINWINWIN: Good luck
 CyberLemonade: thanks
 AntiSquid: did you read the certificate descriptions?
 CyberLemonade: yeah, why?
 AntiSquid: algorithms one implies you did image manipulation on CG&#160;:/
 CyberLemonade: music scores :joy:
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 tobk: All the mouseover-texts on the certificates are a bit odd, e.g. the "coding speed" one is about "complex problems", yet you get if for solving a few CoCs...
 AntiSquid: try your solution on actual image files, see how far it gets you 
 CyberLemonade: let's not talk about that
 CyberLemonade: besides like tobk said, CoC certifies almost nothing
 AntiSquid: why not?
 CyberLemonade: it won't do shit
 CyberLemonade: that's why
 AntiSquid: blender, photoshop, using game engines ... 
 AntiSquid: some ML for style transfer 
 CyberLemonade: hmmmmmmm
 CyberLemonade: I still don't think I'll get anywhere, I pretty much depended on the sharp edges and all
 jrke: oh there are fun commands also 
 jrke: lemme try

 Gorbit99: does somone use firefox here?
 Gorbit99: with greasemonkey preferably, but not necessarily
 Tiramon: i use chrome with tampermonkey which uses the same scripts as greasemonkey ... so no to your questions, maybe i can help anyway
 Gorbit99: well, I would appreciate some testers for my no-autocomplete script
 Tiramon: not sure what that script would do ... but ok ...
 Gorbit99: but I got a notice already that it doesn't work on firefox
 Gorbit99: well, it disables the autocomplete popup in the ide here

 Tiramon: why don't you just right click in the editor -&gt; Language configuration -&gt; Enable/disable code completion support
 Gorbit99: where would this be?
 Tiramon: oh it's not there for all languages ...
 Tiramon: java has it js doesnÄt
 Tiramon: doesn't
 Gorbit99: where is this?
 Tiramon: Right click in the editor .. and sometimes there is an element below 'Command Palette'
 Gorbit99: ah, nice
 c0nc4c: pog i did my first puzzle 
 Gorbit99: anyways, this does that for all languaes
 c0nc4c: :pog
 Gorbit99: good job
 Tiramon: hm interesting ... seems to be only available in java ...
 Gorbit99: try my thing, if it works, it would be grrat
 Tiramon: if i do ctrl + space it now returns no suggestions instead of usefull suggestions ... still no idea why i would want to disable it
 JBM: cuz it gets in the way
 Gorbit99: it's quite a requested thing
 Tiramon: never hat that problem ...
 Gorbit99: next thing I'll try to disable will be autopairs
 Tiramon: *had
 Gorbit99: Tiramon I assume not a big coc player :P
 Tiramon: not much coc and if i do it i still had no problem with completion
 Gorbit99: my solution works for all languages btw
 CyberLemonade: am I overthinking or is detective pikaptcha E2 pretty complex?
 Tiramon: guess overthinking... later episodes are worse
 Tiramon: EP3 i a bit complicated because of the mobius part
 CyberLemonade: I still can't deal with wall follow&#160;:(
 Tiramon: what is your problem CyberLemonade?
 CyberLemonade: I don't know, how do I follow a wall?
 Uljahn: click follow ezpz
 Tiramon: it simply you have to choose what direction to walk next depending on your current facing
 Tiramon: so if you follow the left wall you will try the directions in the following order when facing up LEFT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN
 Tiramon: and take the first route that is not blocked by a wall
 Marchete: "Coding speed" Bronze level
 Marchete: nailed it :D
 Tiramon: and if you create such priority lists for all your facing directions the problem should almost be solved&#160;;)
 Illedan: :D Marchete
 CyberLemonade: thanks Tiramon, silly me
 Tiramon: as i said probably overthinking&#160;;)

 Marchete: top players from CG constests can beat them with a crappy laptop and some cheetos 
 Ak47aman: hii
 MSmits: not a fan of cheetos&#160;;/
 dbdr: Marchete: sure we can
 dbdr: now how do we get the funding?
 BenjaminUrquhart: theft, clearly
 eulerscheZahl: online scam
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a Nigerian prince btw
 LinhT.Nguyen: john brzenk
 eulerscheZahl: a Nigerian toad I mean. you have to kiss me first
 dbdr: I rather meant the prizes
 dbdr: with our cheap laptops we don't need funding
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, you already prepared the way for 3d viewer for such dogfiht multi on CG
 eulerscheZahl: so the rest will be a breeze. step in and do it&#160;:)
 dbdr: could be teapots shooting tea at each other
 dbdr: less war-themed
 eulerscheZahl: the teapot already has some kind of cannon modeled
 eulerscheZahl: spilling tea on each other
 dbdr: we need such commentators for CG contests
 wlesavo: tonight i realized that ^ is not the same as power in c++ and easily got +40k in sg. i basically scored solutions as ^2, surprised that even worked somehow
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: in optim you typically keep the best thing you found
 dbdr: so any search will find somewhat good results
 eulerscheZahl: but the ^2 is part of the score computation
 dbdr: it won't return stupids results like a bad multiplayer search would
 eulerscheZahl: so the score is either 0 or 1 per group
 eulerscheZahl: it will try to find as many groups of size 3,5,.. as possible
 dbdr: ah ok
 Scarfield: uneven groups ftw
 eulerscheZahl: aka odd :D
 Scarfield: xD
 jojogay: btw i use arch
 Scarfield: 3 syllables &gt; 1 syllable
 wlesavo: well at least it worked better than random choice
 eulerscheZahl: is that the no one - absolutely no one meme?
 eulerscheZahl: no one:absolutely no one:jojo: i use arch

 dbdr: If I understood that dogfight contest, I think they had a ranking stepthen the semi-finals are #1 against #4 and #2 against #3
 dbdr: that makes for more dramatic end of a contest than watching a leaderboard during hours :D
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like a weird mode
 eulerscheZahl: something you would do in real world but not for bot fights where you can run lots of battles at almost no cost
 dbdr: it's the same in tennis for instance, or world cup, or many sports
 dbdr: yes, it's probably less accurate but more interesting to watch
 eulerscheZahl: but these sports are real world. teams get exhausted and have limited timeframes
 dbdr: though it has implications related to RPS
 dbdr: especially if you allow agents to learn between matches
 Zm4j: how to see my country ranking, not world ranking
 dbdr: you can improve against that specific opponent
 eulerscheZahl: as a contestant i would be pissed
 wlesavo: as a contestant i would be one :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: would not
 wlesavo: damn
 Scarfield: in the leaderboard the is a colomn for contries, you can choose "same as Zm4j"
 dbdr: *witchcraft
 Scarfield: there is a *
 dbdr: I think considering the spectacle aspect would be an interesting move for CG
 dbdr: something like e-sports
 eulerscheZahl: our japanese competitors did that
 dbdr: how?
 eulerscheZahl: streaming how they play one of their games after another, manually opening them :D
 dbdr: oh ok
 darkhorse64: leapfrog race in sg with wlesavo and yurkovas
 eulerscheZahl: nah, i'm out
 dbdr: one problem is, while you are competing and writing code in a short period, not much time to watch others

 Automaton2000: let me see if i could have done better
 eulerscheZahl: at least the teapot contribution tells you exactly what to expect :P
 eulerscheZahl: i think JBM fooled all of us

 JBM: hey, the html5 contribution is perfectly clear what to expect
 JBM: who's leading the score, btw? still dbdr?

 JBM: him right
 JBM: provided you're both deterministic, that is

 eulerscheZahl: at least it was in the past

 Scarfield: what if you get temperatures -1 and 1?
 aCat:&#160;:-)
 aCat: nice try euler
 aCat: thanks wlesavo
 aCat: code is theoretically simple, but requires reading, and understanding the publication
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't even really started reading yet. you are too fast wlesavo
 aCat: and ok, being honest, not SO simple ;p
 TheScore: how can i know what validators want from me&#160;?&#160;:((((
 JBM: to think the only obstacle to getting RR replay URLs is just to get it approved
 JBM: oh wait
 JBM: i just got a crazy evil idea
 eulerscheZahl: refused

 DanielAndersonGames: Hi BkDevDude.
 BkDevDude: i just finished the introduction path, what should i do next?
 TheScore: @AntiSquid you mean that I should limit the numbers to be bigger than -273 or something??

 dbdr: AI trouncing human pilot
 aCat: start with some easy codingame puzzles
 aCat: the one with graphics
 AntiSquid: ya pilot does no damage lol
 Scarfield: AI not even gonna take dmg by the looks of it :o
 Scarfield: just do the top gun move, it works every time
 AntiSquid: TheScore watch this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzdhIA2S35w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzdhIA2S35w</a> then read statement, stop overthinking the problem, just attention to detail @_@

 BkDevDude: ok
 TheScore: Thanks @AntiSquid, I also solved the problem &lt;3
 Astrobytes: interesting aCat, I didn't know there even was a JPS+
 aCat: nice you found this interesting Astrobytes&#160;:-)
 aCat: the algorithm is really cool
 aCat: and speedup is amazing
 darkhorse64: My only complaint would be that jump points are not defined but, after reading a few times the reference paper, I realize this cannot be summarized easily. You gotta read the f* paper&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Just glanced at the paper, yes indeed the results are pretty damn good
 Astrobytes: Reading sorted for tomorrow then
 aCat: there was also recent (2 years ago IJCAI) even more preprocessing speedup
 aCat: but then preprocessing take ages&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: lol, trade-off eh
 aCat: maybe n future I will add more pathfinding stuff

 Astrobytes: &amp; RedFieldMan
 Memo12334: hi is anyone online who knows BFS
 Alpoc: using the built in editor. inside the main game loop. 
 Astrobytes: Sure, define them outside the loop Alpoc
 Memo12334: when u first used BFS , ya just read theory and could implement it ur self?

 WhiteGlove: need a hint for the bulk email generator
 WhiteGlove: is regex a good aproax?
 WhiteGlove: approach*
 jacek: i used regex
 WhiteGlove: I'm struggling now with multiple parenthesis options but I think I have it
 BenjaminUrquhart: weegex
 WhiteGlove: I'm going to go group by group but still not sure how to manage to save the results
 WhiteGlove: sup, Benjamin, long time no see
 BenjaminUrquhart: do I know you from somewhere?
 WhiteGlove: long time ago we chatted on another puzzle
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 WhiteGlove: with eulerzhal too
 WhiteGlove: Im stuck at the second test of bulk email
 matmozaur: 2313312
 matmozaur: run
 matmozaur: sadasd
 BenjaminUrquhart: WhiteGlove what's your approach so far
 Hjax: BenjaminUrquhart is alive!
 BenjaminUrquhart: am I
 Hjax: pretty sure
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok yes
 WhiteGlove: Shall I share it here?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I took a hiatus after the spring challenge
 BenjaminUrquhart: sure I guess since it's not working
 Hjax: the spring challenge hurt me, but ive done a bit of othello since then 
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice
 BenjaminUrquhart: Whi

 BenjaminUrquhart: WhiteGlove hi
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok
 WhiteGlove: there u go, hope Java is alright, mate
 WhiteGlove: with this I can pass test 1
 WhiteGlove: but my brain is overcomplicating everything
 BenjaminUrquhart: what's your actual code
 WhiteGlove: that one
 WhiteGlove: I made some stuff but waaay to ocmplicated, I'm trying to work something around
 WhiteGlove: based on what I shared
 WhiteGlove: I just want some hints
 BenjaminUrquhart: looks fine to me
 WhiteGlove: but not entirely sure how to manage the String build answer
 BenjaminUrquhart: you have the choices, now you just need to follow the instructions in the description for how to choose them
 BenjaminUrquhart: I replaced the entire match with the choice
 BenjaminUrquhart: template = template.replaceFirst(Pattern.quote("("+group+")"), choice);
 WhiteGlove: :O
 WhiteGlove: hold up
 WhiteGlove: what do u mean by "group"
 WhiteGlove: the whole parenthesis?
 BenjaminUrquhart: the whole thing in parenthesis
 BenjaminUrquhart: the return value of matcher.group(1)
 WhiteGlove: That is what I have in mind... now to the test
 WhiteGlove: When in your mind works wonders but your hands can not replicate... 
 WhiteGlove: btw, why replace first and not plain replace?
 BenjaminUrquhart: in case there happens to be more than 1 place those choices are used in the string
 WhiteGlove: ok, now it only works for the first optoin :D
 WhiteGlove: step by step brother
 WhiteGlove: but still doesnt pass test
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm... i never played with java matcher... this regex worked for me in php...  '/\((.*?)\)/s'
 WhiteGlove: it's not the regex tho
 WhiteGlove: "\\(([^)]+)\\)"
 WhiteGlove: I'm currently using this in Java
 WhiteGlove: it works for me
 WhiteGlove: My problem is more logic than lack of tools
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh... so you have to split the choices and then string replace
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it easy in php
 BenjaminUrquhart: apparently I used this for some reason: "\\(((?:.|\\s)*?)\\)"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I never did so much string manipulation in java
 BenjaminUrquhart: I swear half of the string manipulation functions in java take regexes as arguments
 WhiteGlove: yep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: regexs are slow and weird, i use them on cg from time to time, but I used it more when doing PERL
 BenjaminUrquhart: perl is a regex
 Alpoc: PERL, im so sorry you have to use that XD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was doing perl when I was 25...hmmm 24 years ago
 Alpoc: That makes sense
 WhiteGlove: Benjamin, can I ask you help with the groups?
 WhiteGlove: when my code finishes, correctly, with the first parenthesis.. it fails on the second
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the new puzzle Dungepns and Maps is fun
 WhiteGlove: problem solved
 WhiteGlove: bug*
 S_viper: hi
 S_viper: :clown:]
 S_viper:  this game is fun :innocent:

 Zm4j: how do i send private message to someone on this site, and not do /.msg
 BenjaminUrquhart: go to their profile iirc
 Zm4j: there is just follow button
 BenjaminUrquhart: follow, then message
 Zm4j: there is no text button after i follow the guy&#160;:/
 Counterbalance: should be a 'private message' button here, zm4j: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/515c7cbb29dd9ace070b90dc24fd95a10047953/following">https://www.codingame.com/profile/515c7cbb29dd9ace070b90dc24fd95a10047953/following</a>
 Laminator: Not sharing my code to that reverse. That was garbage lol
 TheSpiffiest: whaaa.  Ha. I just saw you can use numpy in python
 TheSpiffiest: That simplifies things
 tssw: :thumbsup:
 TheSpiffiest: Nice work, thanks for sharing code.&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: I was actually thinking how easy that would be in R
 volkarion: I've been struggling hard core with A*...... I am missing something and all the research I'm doing keeps making it worse... is there any thing you have used that has helped?

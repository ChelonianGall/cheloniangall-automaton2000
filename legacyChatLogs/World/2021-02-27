 JayM9: hey guys
 JayM9: so i just did a class of code
 JayM9: it was the one of ranking soccer teams based on points, goal diffrence, and # goals. Where can I find that if I didn't finish
 milkbeforethecereal: i didnt get that one at all
 creeperZnation4:     @JayM9 I'm not sure if you can find the clash of code questions anywhere... They're shorter than the normal ones so I doubt they're among the normal problems

 geppoz: any Java expert can explain this:
 geppoz: System.out.println( ( new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy").parse("2021/02/26") ) );
 geppoz: outputs:
 geppoz: Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CET 31
 geppoz: (and it is declared to throw ParseException...)
 geppoz: sad story
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: :cry:
 Technove: hi guys
 java_coffee_cup: @geppoz  I think I cracked the mystery behind SimpleDateFormate.parse()
 java_coffee_cup: when you use 26 to feed to yyyy, it interpreted as year 26 AD
 java_coffee_cup: month is 2
 java_coffee_cup: day is 2021, which overflows the days in a month. The extra days will be carried over to month and years. So 2021 days roughly is 5.5 years. The year value of 26 adds 5 becomes 31
 GiangHoGoVap: em ơi em sướng chưa&#160;?
 java_coffee_cup: if you print the date value of the incorrect parse result, you see the year is 31, month is Aug
 AntiSquid: GiangHoGoVap Nếu tôi có thể sử dụng google dịch, bạn cũng vậy!
 AntiSquid: #VN 
 AntiSquid: oh god it's dead and empty, nevermind, just stay here and try english
 Samo_AM: Hello
 GeorgiD: How do you turn this binary clock to normal clock: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50f63abb-e25d-455a-93ae-e8bc73bb2b62">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50f63abb-e25d-455a-93ae-e8bc73bb2b62</a>
 GeorgiD: This was a bad problem with no good explanation of how it works
 Samo_AM: how work binary clock?
 GeorgiD: A reverse mode in which 123 returns 24 and 1234 returns 120?
 GeorgiD: Nvm
 GeorgiD: Its the product of every digit+1
 geppoz: java_coffee_cup ty, I imagined that, but what's the point to specify a format, when it just guesses any numbers? "dd" means  "day of month", not just a random days quantity... for me this is a bug
 jacek: this is java
 java_coffee_cup: it is a feature. Calendar days (its fields) allows + and - operations, so it also have carry over. When you add 1 to day 31, it becomes the next month's day 1. The year can change too when Dec 31 adds 1 
 FalconX: OK
 Afranzio: Hy
 FalconX: hy
 geppoz: java_coffee_cup I don't agree
 geppoz: that is a feature when you add/subtract to Date object
 geppoz: this is a "Format" class
 geppoz: = it should be meant to parse following a specific format
 geppoz: in the pattern specification "d" is "day in month" not "relative days quantity"
 java_coffee_cup: It is a flexible parser more than a strict C's printf format. It allows parsing 31 by dd but it cannot immediately tell is 31 a valid day limit for that particular month and year. So when it allows reading 31 to Feb, it also allows reading 999 to any month. The dd should throw exception if you feed it with "abc"
 GeorgiD: 31 3 52 4 -1 to the output 9 in reverse mode
 GeorgiD: How does it work?
 GeorgiD: Cuz the other test cases glitched out and won't show
 jtsimmons: multiply the columns and then add the results

 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/retaining-water">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/retaining-water</a>
 Quidome: In the comments they suggest this can be done without a floodfill 
 Quidome: I don't see it (without a floodfill) 
 geppoz: yes, it is possible, I'm not sure it is more efficient though
 geppoz: you can just scan iteratively all grid and remove "blocks" of water, until you complete an iteration without removing anything
 Quidome: hm, still not getting my head around it the borders seems relevant and you are suggesting some sort of reverse way of working
 Quidome: Well, i think i go for the itterative floodfill
 geppoz: just done
 geppoz: this solution is really easy
 geppoz: I think completely inefficient, but very easy to programming
 Amsterism: Hi, I need an expert&#160;!&#160;:)If someone can check this topic&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/defibrillators/189524/1">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/defibrillators/189524/1</a>
 KiwiTae: Amsterism just need to compute min distance to the tool no?
 Amsterism: What do you mean&#160;?
 Amsterism: Am I doing the wrong thing&#160;?
 KiwiTae: Amsterism whats your approach&#160;? hehe
 KiwiTae: oh i didnt check your post let me read
 DaNinja: you need to split DEFIB to get the lon/lat for each
 KiwiTae: the code is gone thou hehe (u cannot share code in forum I think)
 RedBreakfast_da01: @DaNinja that's what I did
 KiwiTae: if you parse correctly
 likki1811: hey
 KiwiTae: maybe u feeding the wrong thing in the cosinus
 likki1811: how do you solve temperaturesgfame
 KiwiTae: likki1811 you read the hints?
 likki1811: game*
 KiwiTae: whats your solution at&#160;?
 likki1811: yes i solved it to a part
 KiwiTae: u just need to return the closest abs value to 0 
 likki1811: yes
 KiwiTae: so which test are you fialing?
 likki1811: shall i send the code
 KiwiTae: yes copy paste here gonna make a link
 likki1811: im failing at the caseno temperatureand alsochoose the right temperature
 likki1811: heres the code
 likki1811: V
 likki1811: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2abb1514-b975-494f-8ca3-dcb6e003ab64">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2abb1514-b975-494f-8ca3-dcb6e003ab64</a>
 KiwiTae: likki1811 if n = 0 return 0 smth like that
 likki1811: ya once can you check the code
 KiwiTae: set you lowest to 9999 in the init
 KiwiTae: and remove whats before the loop lol
 KiwiTae: you should compare abs(lowest) var with the new input in the loop
 likki1811: yaaa
 KiwiTae: if you dont compare the input to your current value not gonna work hehe
 likki1811: actually i dont rally know abt strings so i used my own ideas
 likki1811: I'm getting error whenever I include math functions (assuming you know abt that). so i made my own absolute of an integer by     t*t-1
 DaNinja: Amsterism try replacing the comma before parsing
 DaNinja: latAStr = latAStr.Replace(',', '.');
 RedBreakfast_da01: @DaNinja yes the problem was comming from the fact that trying to parse a string with a ',' doesnt return false
 RedBreakfast_da01: It parse and remove completely the , Imagine parsing&#160;: 1,5 would return 15 
 RedBreakfast_da01: ...
 Blai8: Golfing in c# is gonna kill me
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt; Blai8 then dont hehe
 Shatranj: use ruby
 KiwiTae: Amsterism just do DEFIB.Split(';');then Double.Parse(str)
 DaNinja: likki1811 you have a bug at if(t=0)
 bigmazi: is it possible to switch back to the Silver League in Coders Strike Back? 
 LaZeta: You can use history to check the previous code
 LaZeta: Would like to know if this exists
 LaZeta: (switching back to lower leagues)
 likki1811: @DaNinja can please discribe it I'm not able to get ir
 likki1811: it*
 planck6: this is live chat
 planck6:&#160;?

 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 trictrac: I just wrote an explaination of your 0 score on first round
 trictrac: @ the end of the game you have to memorize the remaining cards in your hand
 AntiSquid: would prefer if the game would tell me the empty cards and id
 trictrac: Ok sorry for that
 AntiSquid: parsing isn't very friendly
 AntiSquid: fixed all issues now i think
 trictrac: 1 league will be a formality
 AntiSquid: now i need to get to actual game of trying to guess when to risk playing a card
 kovi: i blame the reviewers&#160;:)
 kovi: i have also encountered this issue today
 AntiSquid: ya they should get a beating until morale improves
 AntiSquid: oh i think you meant those who approved the game
 AntiSquid: hanabi is a fun game, i stand by my review, but i wouldn't have approved this
 jacek: /me
 samuel_wondimu: any one who found ajob from this site
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: few and far between
 darkhorse64: I would say that the interface is minimalist (which is a good thing because there is a lot to parse) but the missing parts (cards played) cab be easily deduced
 TheSilentBreakfast_f26a: is this discord?
 jacek: no
 jacek: this is celestia
 Astrobytes: For me it became clear when I printed the output and checked it while reading through the statement. Made perfect sense after that.

 Yasser: Huhu I see now what you're talking about.. sounds long enough to be lazy about xD 
 Yasser: I didn't know puzzle of the week can be by leagues.. like this one
 Astrobytes: You don't normally play multis Yasser?
 Yasser: that comes once in a while, things are being changed in community puzzles, that's what I mean..
 Astrobytes: Ah, I see from your profile you do. Yeah, community multis, if they have 2 or more leagues are eligible for puzzle of the week
 Yasser: I'm an old condinGamer anyway that's why I'm not aware fully on what's new here xD
 Astrobytes: Completion of it requires ascending to the next league iirc
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know
 Astrobytes: Or remember rather
 Astrobytes: Yeah things are a little different around CG these days...

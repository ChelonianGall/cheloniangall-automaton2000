 jacek: invalid paste
 jwpapi: jacek how is it invalid I pasted right in here

 Uljahn: Automaton2000: one can only hope
 Automaton2000: premature optimization is the root of all evil
 j4at: time to update to 3.11.0 beta 4 :p
 j4at: It's x1.5 faster than 3.9 so It will lower servers costs. Mostly bc python is the most popular language in the website + its slow

 jacek: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, but wrong game
 DomiKo: nahhh
 wlesavo: euler its the right one, but the last frame is somewhat buged
 eulerscheZahl: i mean: he should play the contest instead
 wlesavo: ooh :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: thought it was obvious
 wlesavo: it probably is but i spend whole minute trying to figure out how is that a tie
 wlesavo: btw do you plan to play new raic?
 eulerscheZahl: probably
 eulerscheZahl: have to figure out their new platform. lots of Russian
 eulerscheZahl: no tshirts?
 jacek: hmm this contest has t-shirts?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 jacek:&#160;:(
 jacek: i wanted refurbished t-shirt
 wlesavo: there are tshirts, but no sweetshots
 eulerscheZahl: i understand that they don't want to shoot
 eulerscheZahl: even if candies
 wlesavo: for participants in final there will be some weird prizes, im not sure even what it is
 eulerscheZahl: free cloud computing worth X rubles? :D
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how hard i will try. I want to go a bit more towards topcoder for practice
 wlesavo: i think it is some russian alexa analogue :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: do i have to create a new account on the RAIC website or can i somehow claim my old one?
 wlesavo: i really like the raic theme, but again wont have much time, i hope to get to finals, but then ill have to leave for vacation, and probably wont be able to proceed
 wlesavo: oh, i dont know, i just logged in with google
 Quidome: what is RAIC?
 eulerscheZahl: the old RAIC contests were migrated to the new website
 eulerscheZahl: russian AI cup
 eulerscheZahl: i saw my username on the new website and would prefer to keep using that account. i used email+password on the old platform (i don't even remember if they offered alternatives)
 wlesavo: yeah, i think i logged in with the same email, but there are no previous raic results in my profile, so i cant figure out if it is the same account or another one
 eulerscheZahl: a previous RAIC with a game similar to rocket league<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p73XwFCbkA&amp;ab_channel=AndreyLama">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p73XwFCbkA&amp;ab_channel=AndreyLama</a>
 eulerscheZahl: those are like "wood rules", in the end you had nitro and 3 robots per team
 aCat: If I haver time I will at least look at RAIC
 aCat: never participated before&#160;:(
 MSmits: ahh finally i found my bug, been stuck for half a day :P
 eulerscheZahl: i'm stuck for several already. and my attempt to change search type doesn't look good either&#160;:(
 jacek: you fixed bug and it got worse?
 eulerscheZahl: i have no bugs that i'm aware of. just a terrible bot in general
 darkhorse64: legend is going to be insanely difficult
 jacek: its quite random you still have a chance
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i'm happy if i reach legend this contest
 eulerscheZahl: would be the first time that i miss it
 j4at: there is first time for everything
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 MSmits: usually legend ends up having 130 players or so. This is a game with a lot of randomness. Someone will push you in I think euler
 MSmits: otherwise just fit your bot to be anti-goldboss
 eulerscheZahl: my submit are always around the same rank. i don't believe in a lucky push
 MSmits: but maybe the lucky push believes in you
 MSmits: i think I just had my last major improvement for this bot, will have to create a new seach to improve further
 MSmits: it's a good one though, 68% WR vs old bot
 jacek: *10 bugs later* maybe not
 MSmits: well i am always hoping for more bugs of course
 MSmits: my bot now searches iteratively with greater play depth, sometimes up to 7
 MSmits: (meaning 7 skill cards played in a row)
 MSmits: most turns fully searched
 MSmits: some exceptions, then it stops when out of time
 darkhorse64: Argh, when your new bot ranks lower than the previous one and when resubmitting the old one ranks even lower
 MSmits: heh yeah
 MSmits: I'm curious about jace k's bot
 MSmits: hope he will do a pm
 MSmits: (dont tell us now though)
 j4at: isn't he is using a NN
 darkhorse64: I am curious about all search bots
 j4at:&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea j4at
 jacek: printing 3rd action
 jacek: no one goes that far
 jacek: im scared trying 4th
 MSmits: I'm dreading trying new search, but i guess I have to.
 MSmits: so much work =/
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl did you try psy ho's method?
 MSmits: i mean i understand it's no guarantee. There are 100s of choices to make in that type of search
 darkhorse64: 8h30 stream :zzz:
 MSmits: no no, he explained it here
 MSmits: the idea is easy to grasp
 eulerscheZahl: best i can do with the approach so far is beating bottom gold on occasion
 MSmits: ah i see
 MSmits: so you did try that
 MSmits: it's actually more your style 
 MSmits: this search type
 MSmits: maybe dont give up yet&#160;:)
 therealbeef: what did he use?
 therealbeef: *does
 MSmits: MC till end of game
 MSmits: with heuristics for players
 therealbeef: without tree?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: tree is impossible, except on your own first turn, up until the first training of coding card
 MSmits: or
 MSmits: random kills it
 jacek: still he could use UCB for first ply
 MSmits: yes he could
 eulerscheZahl: i would still have to come up with heuristics. tried more of the illedan route (random for 3 turns and eval final state)
 MSmits: use mcts type search up to move + throw/give even
 MSmits: and first card
 eulerscheZahl: also used a single-player search. setting opponent location to -1 after my first turn
 MSmits: is that any good?
 MSmits: seems much easier to me
 eulerscheZahl: total garbage
 MSmits: are you sure the approach is bad or did it maybe have bugs?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure about anything
 MSmits: how about giving the opponent a random location
 MSmits: instead of -1
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think this will change anything except making it even more unreliable for my bot
 MSmits: yeah it might
 MSmits: i think the opponent -1 method isnt much worse than psyho's method early game but that it gets bad near the end
 MSmits: psyho's method converges on reality
 MSmits: I am actually not that worried about coding the sim and search, but I have no idea how to make a heuristic bot for this
 MSmits: the whole idea about my current bot is avoiding that&#160;:)
 philipplenk: I wouldn't say tree is impossible(source: i use one and get a reasonably decent rank ~20)
 MSmits: how deep does the tree go?
 MSmits: beyond the current turn?
 MSmits: whats open loop?
 eulerscheZahl: and what to do with random cards? just assign some at random to you?
 MSmits: oh it is like smitsimax!
 philipplenk: dont store the states, store only statisticts and recreate state when traversing
 MSmits: nodes do not correspond to states
 MSmits: just to sequences of actions
 Sheeesh---: is there away to know how many cards left on desk or should i just count&#160;?
 philipplenk: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: 5 - your cards - opponent cards (or 36 for bonus)
 jacek: hm? sequence of actions in node?
 jacek: like storing A-&gt;B-&gt;C?
 jacek: in single node?
 MSmits: philipplenk you can keep this approach and replace the random rollout with heuristically chosen actions
 MSmits: then it should maybe be better than psy ho's method
 aCat: yeah but here is wide choice
 Illedan: Is Release a node? Or only the Move?
 MSmits: jacek no, every action is a node
 aCat: starting with 'predefined heuristic' or random heuristic
 philipplenk: I am trying that, my rollouts are not completely random, but my heuristics are horrible xD
 MSmits: but the node has a specific sequence of actions that leads to it
 MSmits: but i am explaining my interpretation, we have the creator here :P
 kovi: then i dont see what node represents after a while(why would it converge)
 MSmits: kovi it might not converge, but is it worse than total MC with heuristics?
 MSmits: because that is what the nr 1 uses
 kovi: maybe just do node for 1 turn then random rollouts
 MSmits: yeah might be better, hard to say here. It's such a weird game
 philipplenk: I think it should converge with enough time. A node represents - eventually - the expected value after executing that sequence of moves. I hope
 MSmits: yes, but you kill the ability for your bot to respond properly to a lucky card draw
 MSmits: which heuristics can
 philipplenk: True
 MSmits: your search responds to the average card draw
 MSmits: more or less
 MSmits: MC will try all those possible draws and then respond differently to each one
 philipplenk: Makes sense
 kovi: yes, that mean tree reuse is not possible
 MSmits: assumign the heuristics have some flexibility
 MSmits: well i wasnt even considering reuse, that seems unimportant
 kovi: becuase of no states? true
 MSmits: even in simple boardgames that gives small benefit
 MSmits: i guess because you move several times in a row here, the benefit would be larger
 MSmits: yeah if you have a tree that includes move, throw, give etc. You could reuse
 MSmits: more opportunity to introduce bugs though&#160;:)
 Nerchio: duck will be first again soon xd
 Sheeesh---: slowly but surely
 jacek: :duck:
 Psyho: depends who submits
 Psyho: I believe I have around 60% WR over duck
 Nerchio: i hope my current bot wil be enough for legend :D
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: maybe not on the initial promotion, but soon after
 Nerchio: but it seems like one of those games where spamming submits will work at some point
 MSmits: that's my hope&#160;:)
 MSmits: it always works to some extent, because you are pushing the bots that are strong against you, out of the league
 MSmits: leaving only the bots that are weak vs you, and the boss
 MSmits: which means a 51% WR vs bot is enough
 MSmits: vs boss
 elderlybeginner: what's your approach to choosing an action in PLAY_CARD pahse?
 elderlybeginner: I guess I won't get to gold with random
 MSmits: I do a full search of my turn and evaluate the end result
 MSmits: which means move+give+throw+play+release
 MSmits: on carddraw (training/coding) I weigh each possible draw by probability of it ocurring
 MSmits: so a really rare combination of 2 cards drawn will not count for as much
 elderlybeginner: how do you score evaluation?
 elderlybeginner: or better when you release and when you don't release?
 MSmits: this is mostly secret (for competitive reasons), but you can think about the obvious like scoring technical debt and finishing apps. 
 elderlybeginner: simplifiing how much technical debt is still worth to release?
 MSmits: i have mine limited to at most 2, but if i set it to a different value, i dont get a different bot
 elderlybeginner: I really don't like this contest, so my competiveness will end if I get into gold with smallest possible effort :joy:
 MSmits: i also score technical debt separately so my bot will avoid getting too much anyways
 Rafarafa: is there a way to test my bot without using the codingame arena? it's too slow&#160;:(

 ArslanAli: how to figure out how much jump it will make?
 elie.f.asmar: Do I need to output anything or just write a running function that solves the problem
 ArslanAli: initial position is 2 5
 ArslanAli: with UR it jumps to 5 4, 3 pt up and 1 right
 ArslanAli: how to know these values, 3 and 1?
 Uljahn: ArslanAli: by dividing unexplored search space in half? you don't need to know exact numbers to make an informative guessing
 Ayza: you need to output the answer elie.f.asmar
 Ayza: It's just like solving it in a coc
 ArslanAli: Uljahn can you help me more in it

 Astrobytes: Hmm. Discrimination against fellow felines!
 Miki09: :taco: Wontonimo
 ArianPunk: i mean, if it's one of the best in terms of performance.
 Astrobytes: Must have gone offline.
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: ArianPunk it needs to be public and voted for by users iirc
 jacek: if there is win and lose in double battle, is it counted as draw by CG?
 Astrobytes: I'm not entirely sure tbh jacek
 Illedan: Think it is a win and a draw, as I get changes in my rank in that case
 ArianPunk: users may not see it or check whether it's the fastest.
 struct: I dont think so jacek

 elderlybeginner: can you drop some heuristic ideas for the contest?
 struct: the heuristics I use are only to prune useless moves

 elderlybeginner: and what are useless moves?
 struct: using continuous integration if you already have 2 of that type or if its not required for any of the apps
 ozgurcelebi: selamun aleykum

 geppoz: "Using coding/training if you dont have any card to draw"
 struct: ah wait
 struct: not coding
 struct: You are right
 geppoz: but if there are cards in "discarded" they will draw, right?
 struct: Yeah by draw i meant also including discard pile
 geppoz: ok
 struct: I think its very rare
 struct: But I guess it might be possible so I included it
 geppoz: uhm that reminds me a question:
 geppoz: if I play a "coding", and draw is empty, i could get that card again?
 geppoz: since it goes in discard then reshuffled?
 geppoz: in same turn I mean
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: none of the cards you play go in discard
 MSmits: they go to "played"
 geppoz: well, another array to store :D
 MSmits: yes
 geppoz: i put them directly in discard
 MSmits: thats how it was when the contest started
 MSmits: but it allowed infinite coding/training
 MSmits: so it got fixed
 geppoz: ok ty
 jacek: thanks to the community it got fixed
 jacek: and some people complained CG doesnt host community contests no more
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized that i disallowed to ever make and debt on project release. maybe not the smartest choice
 eulerscheZahl: any*
 MSmits: dont think so either
 eulerscheZahl: let's submit a debt maker
 Nerchio: its not the smartest choice considering there's a lot of people in the top ending the game with 20+ debt :P

 eulerscheZahl: upload to imgur or so
 Rafarafa: is anyone here running brutaltester on mac?
 GNye22: That's weird tho because some of the discussions for this puzzle talk about users using custom tests
 ProbabilityIsNotMaths: nvm I found out my problem, ty 
 eulerscheZahl: or make a normal pastebin (pastebin.com) instead of chat pastebin
 eulerscheZahl: rubber duck debugging
 Rafarafa: or rather, has anyone managed to run his/her local arena for this contest in mac? 
 eulerscheZahl: no, just linux

 j4at: I don't know only 4 days left
 MSmits: j4at i had a full sim on the first sunday. Granted, it was bugged, but all small bugs
 struct: I can probably write a sim for this in 2 hours now
 MSmits: and I am not the fastest coder so... if you focus
 struct: Since I now know the rules
 MSmits: yeah that is the worst part
 j4at: you are not the fastest
 j4at: but im the slowest
 j4at: :p
 struct: 4 days is more than enough imo
 struct: The bugs are fixed, the rules are explained better now
 MSmits: it's more about focus. I refound the focus i had when i first entered a CG contest many years ago, it's a weird experience
 struct: If I close the chat Ill get legend, if I dont I probably wont
 MSmits: I have slept 4-6 hrs every night this week and i am still going... do need to catch up a bit tonight though :P
 struct: I wouldnt be able to code if I slept that little
 j4at: Damn MSmits is hardcore
 emh: I was like MSMits up until the day that I took a sleeping pill, preemptively reducing the chances of crashing 
 emh: but now I was partying with a couch surfer drinking bourbon, but I felt the draw back to the green circle
 emh: so I'm gonna drunk code my sim

 Westicles: shortest/reverse/fastest
 eulerscheZahl: really, that's determinied before
 eulerscheZahl: didn't know
 eulerscheZahl: i always thought only after launch. as they want to present a task new to everyone and thus can only pick the problem when it starts (late joiners). somehow i assumed that's also when they choose the mode

 Lassassin: on coding game
 Lassassin: wat
 MSmits: lol...
 eulerscheZahl: L - assassin
 MSmits: it's funny because it's the worst joke :P
 Lassassin: ...
 struct: Lassassin use cg local instead
 Lassassin:  ....
 struct: CG local doesnt require you to login on chrome store
 eulerscheZahl: i still copy-paste
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl copy pasted himself to world rank 1 several times
 MSmits: so... it works
 MSmits: but now i made it sound like you stole your bots
 MSmits: sorry
 Lassassin: copy paste is ok but im noob
 struct: Only  I copy pasted my bots
 Lassassin: okay i donwlaoded cglocal
 struct: My mcts bots I mean
 struct: :p
 struct: But ofc I had to create the 1st one
 Lassassin: aw shiet is this written in rust
 MSmits: you stole your own bots?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: evil
 eulerscheZahl: is what written in rust?
 struct: they are all based on tic tac toe mcts
 eulerscheZahl: cg local is in kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: i still have to add tree reuse to my UTTT
 MSmits: it's not critical really
 eulerscheZahl: starting a a green pasture every turn
 struct: reuse sometimes can hurt
 MSmits: the smaller the branching factor the more helpful it is
 eulerscheZahl: i do it for bandas
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow made a bug for uttt
 MSmits: oh yeah it's useful there, but you'll run out of nodes in bandas, so have to reset anyways
 eulerscheZahl: still: i have a loooot of nodes. even those with 0 evals
 struct: is bandas ept?
 eulerscheZahl: sure, i clear my node list every few turns
 MSmits: i use random rollout
 eulerscheZahl: you can use and end game book for bandas (i don't)
 MSmits: yes, top 3 all use endgame book, mine is best =)
 eulerscheZahl: the librarian
 MSmits: btw, this is a copy paste book actually, it's not generated in the live bot
 MSmits: for oware i live-generate it
 MSmits: 10 gamestates in 1 unicode character, quite proud of that&#160;:)
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: it's just WLD, so less than 2 bits per result
 MSmits: completly useless to be that compact as it uses less than 30k chars
 MSmits: but i didnt know that beforehand
 eulerscheZahl: and finding the right index doesn't sound too hard
 eulerscheZahl: would be easier with exactly 2 bit
 MSmits: yeah it would
 eulerscheZahl: and of course you optimized before checking how big it will get
 MSmits: :blush:
 eulerscheZahl: afk, eating something else than lentils
 MSmits: that's more specific than afk eating, or just afk
 struct: I dont know why msvc is able to compile even with undefined vars inside asserts
 jacek: thats ms for ya
 TurushkinStanislav: i reset code but nothing happens on screen it just stopped a have slideshow
 TurushkinStanislav: o_O
 TurushkinStanislav: i broke it
 jacek: oh my
 IAmTheBestPlayer: :grinning: :grinning: :grinning:
 Astrobytes: back, lol euler and MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: back as well. i don't understand what a good decision would be, going through replays&#160;:(
 MSmits: same, i am just remove a lot of code atm, all the eval features that don't do anything
 MSmits: removing
 MSmits: reduce the parameter space a bit
 struct: Removing some actions my also help
 struct: may*
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://preview.redd.it/hfnl7xo8yovy.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=702740ed2de621aa05b5e06450e55a1b8a5cdca6">https://preview.redd.it/hfnl7xo8yovy.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=702740ed2de621aa05b5e06450e55a1b8a5cdca6</a>
 jacek: its not rick roll
 StevenV: ctrl + A then delete is the most effective way
 eulerscheZahl: i may have found a parameter that was off. i expect nothing less than top15 (and will soon be disappointed)
 jacek: nothing less than 15, so 15+
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that. let's see if it holds and i get back to 25 again
 struct: I was wrong, the secret for eval was not to add params, but to remove params
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: keep it simple
 MSmits: kiss
 StevenV: I still in sliver you guys
 struct: gold is not easy for this one
 MSmits: what are you doing there?
 MSmits: we're waiting for you StevenV
 StevenV: :D
 struct: I either get legend or retire
 StevenV: well ...
 Konrad_O: Hi guys
 StevenV: too busy this week, hope to have time at Sartuday
 struct: Just don't panic
 struct: I code like 10 lines per hour
 Astrobytes: especially in fastest clashes
 struct: I probably typed more in this chat since the contest started than I typed on my ide
 Astrobytes: that's par for the course tho :D
 StevenV: well top10 are C++
 eulerscheZahl: just type your code here and then copy it into the IDE?
 Dynamolten.: top10 for what?
 Astrobytes: big-brain thinking there euler
 eulerscheZahl: of course, it's a simulation-heavy game
 Dynamolten.: oh nice, wasnt aware of a contest
 eulerscheZahl: green circle, you can find it under activities / events at the top
 struct: StevenV if they use C++ just use D
 eulerscheZahl: 3days 15h still to go
 StevenV: well I am a Heristic Java coder, good luck to me
 eulerscheZahl: java isn't that bad performance wise
 eulerscheZahl: it's what you make out of it
 jacek: oO
 struct: it's pretty bad compared to c++
 Nerchio: on codingame yeah
 struct: well c++ is also handicapped on codingame
 StevenV: well I see C# on top10
 MSmits: if you do heuristics it doesnt matter
 MSmits: any language will work
 StevenV: is C# faster than Java on CG?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: yeah a  little i think
 struct: C# has release mode on cg
 TurushkinStanislav: why faster?
 struct: not sure if java has it or not
 MSmits: tbh, if you decide you don't want to prioritize speed, it doesn't matter if you go C# or java. Just go with what you like
 MSmits: if you want speed, go with c++ or rust or something
 struct: Speed is irrelevant 
 StevenV: I see you are on the top 14 do you write a Heuristic or some AI Algorithm @Nerchio?
 MSmits: i use C# because i like it
 struct: I use c++ because I like speed
 jacek: yes you wear glasses
 jacek: :drum:
 Nerchio: StevenV search + heuristics
 MSmits: well i use c++ because i like  speed also, but sometimes speed is not that important. Then i prefer C#
 StevenV: oh, so a hibid
 struct: Speed is always important to me
 Nerchio: I am pretty sure winner of this tournament will not be because of speed anyway
 eulerscheZahl: wheee, 15th. submit is going well so far
 struct: nice
 eulerscheZahl: aaand it's gone
 struct: not nice
 Astrobytes: you're not supposed to announce that
 Astrobytes: until it's final
 Astrobytes: Bad juju
 StevenV: Thanks, Nerchio
 dbf: euler, congrats with mice submit&#160;:)
 dbf: nice :D
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. hopes for legend are back
 Astrobytes: :mouse2:
 eulerscheZahl: no legend without toad, old tradition
 StevenV: I think of a Heuristic strategy to go into gold, but doesn't have time to code it yet
 Astrobytes: hi dbf&#160;:) will you be joining RAIC?
 dbf: Astrobytes, yes, I hope&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i've been told there are tshirts but no hoodies this time. do you know if it's the usual 300+60 tshirts again?
 Astrobytes: Good to hear!&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: minimum effort tshirt..
 struct: Maybe I'll join to see if I can get my first shirt
 struct: is it easy to setup localy?
 Astrobytes: I'll play regardless
 struct: or is it like bomberland?
 Astrobytes: Yes struct, it comes with a runner
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, in announce they mention that there will be alexa-like devices instead of hoodies
 Miki09: what is RAIC?
 struct: Russian AI cup
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo just called it strange
 Miki09: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cups.online/ru/contests/?category=ai&amp;utm_campaign=to-allcups&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=raic">https://cups.online/ru/contests/?category=ai&amp;utm_campaign=to-allcups&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=raic</a>
 StevenV: and do we have Tshirt for GreenCircle?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but 3 smartphones
 struct: new layout?
 eulerscheZahl: new website
 Astrobytes: it's not Alexa though, it will be Alexy
 StevenV: top3 is very far for me
 eulerscheZahl: that's the old one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>
 dbf: they have some new insane rule that you need to have russian bank account to participate in rating, no idea why they need it, hope they'll skip it for now
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cups.online/en/contests/coderoyale">https://cups.online/en/contests/coderoyale</a>
 Astrobytes: ^ new one
 eulerscheZahl: top3 is far for all of us. just 3 points but it's huuuge skill-wise
 Astrobytes: Oh no, lets hope they skip that dbf
 struct: 1st prize is 5k €?
 Marco_Amaro: hi
 struct: that seems big
 eulerscheZahl: that link is english. and when you click round1, it's russian suddenly (the round description at least)
 dbf: Astrobytes, yep no idea why they need it now if there are only few prices in money
 Astrobytes: Yeah it seems silly. Unless it's in retaliation to all the competitive coding places that disqualified RU players because of you-know-what, I hope not
 struct: oh so I cant play ranked without a russian bank account?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, even if you play just for fun and stay far away from the big prizes?
 eulerscheZahl: bummer
 struct: Guess I'll skip it then
 struct: Maybe ill play locam instead
 jacek: or backgammon
 Astrobytes: Wait and see what happens struct
 eulerscheZahl: no you don't. in Soviet Russia the contest skips you
 struct: my sim is looking better now, just wait
 struct: Now I need an eval
 struct: :p
 struct: reducing the state size might have helped
 eulerscheZahl: many completed projects = good. few = bad
 eulerscheZahl: happy to help
 struct: oh thanks
 Astrobytes: Solid advice.
 dbf: if you try to register there is "For persons who have a bank account in the Russian Federation, who are not employees of VK"
 struct: I was just about to rent some vms to try evals, you just saved me some money
 dbf: I'll check in telegram chat, maybe they'll reply something about it
 struct: thanks
 Astrobytes: dbf: when I registered there was choice of 'Main' or 'non-competitive'
 Astrobytes: ie. sandbox only
 struct: ill finish backgammon jacek, I think I know how to finish the move gen now
 struct: Im not going to participate if non-competitive is the only choice
 miobyte: can anyo
 struct: ne
 miobyte: know k8s?
 struct: are you going to ask this everyday?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/ZtNbL1Z">https://imgur.com/a/ZtNbL1Z</a>
 miobyte: yes
 miobyte: until I found one
 miobyte: who can help me
 Astrobytes: try another website miobyte
 miobyte: no
 struct: o.o
 Nerchio: xd
 miobyte: struct, I think u are an expert in k8s
 Astrobytes: Fair enough. Your time :rofl:
 dbf: struct, I raised it in the chat, hope you guys could play and get your t-shirts as usual&#160;:)
 struct: I don't even know what that means
 miobyte: oh
 miobyte: how to get t shirt then?
 ilgiocatore: t shirt with "k8s" written on it
 miobyte: I would love that
 miobyte: who will gift it to me?
 Astrobytes: Buy a marker pen and a plain t-shirt [solved]
 miobyte: :money_mouth:
 miobyte: u gift me
 Astrobytes: u bore me
 Astrobytes: btw, the image link I posted was the options I got when registering for RAIC, I think it's still OK from those choices
 struct: Maybe its possible
 Astrobytes: we'll find out from the telegram chat I guess
 Astrobytes: I'll still probably play it a bit for something to do
 dbf: Astrobytes, if you click on terms for 'Main' mode there is a note about bank account
 struct: Ill probably do locam, not sure
 struct: the new one
 Astrobytes: Oh I see dbf
 Astrobytes: Well, we will find out I guess.I'd open a Russian bank account but I might get arrested&#160;:|
 struct: dont think its worth it just for a tshirt
 Astrobytes: No, indeed. Damn humans. You'd think we'd all be cool by now.
 dbf: yep, maybe they are not sure that they can transfer monetary prize abroad, but should not be an issue for t-shirt
 Miki09: Astrobytes I beated you :scream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/645292738">https://www.codingame.com/replay/645292738</a>
 Miki09: First time in my life 
 Astrobytes: unsurprising Miki09 my bot is a pile of :poop:
 Miki09: lol
 Astrobytes: hopefully dbf
 TurushkinStanislav: i have no idea what im doing but its working
 dbf: anyway, you can register for Main contest and try, maybe they will not kick participants without accounts 
 aCat: struct new LOCM&#160;:&gt;?
 Astrobytes: yeah, I registered as soon as I saw it&#160;:) I will play anyway if the game is OK
 struct: yes
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 aCat: we need participants&#160;;]
 aCat: preferrably good participants but honestly any will do :P
 Astrobytes: I wrote an idiot bot for it but the tedious input part is done, still to get around to writing something reasonable
 struct: You said its an option to make the code open source right?
 struct: At least from what I understood
 Astrobytes: But struct, everyone wants to look at your elegant avx'd bot
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: "preferrably good participants but honestly any will do :P"your desperation made me laugh
 struct: all you have to do is ask, I shared my bots before
 aCat: euler that is the tue thing in "research" competitions
 Astrobytes: lol, was just joking tbh, but I am curious about some of your MCTSs
 aCat: yeah, it is preferred and probably default to have bots published but we agree if you don;'t want
 eulerscheZahl: i know. for me it's all fun and games. for you it's publish or perish
 struct: Nah I'll share it's fine
 Astrobytes: Indeed euler
 struct: Ill show you after the contest astro
 aCat: things are more complicated, because with current polsih goverment policy publications like those on COG are worthless
 aCat: but still for the sake of future projects and competitions it is good to have numbers
 Astrobytes: cool struct
 miobyte: anyone know about inter system communication?
 Astrobytes: damn aCat, that sucks
 struct: maybe if a polish doesnt win they will fund it again
 aCat: yeah, but thankfully we had AAAI paper this year
 aCat: so we have 2 years of reasonable piece
 aCat: *peace
 aCat: you kknow what ;p
 Astrobytes: Ah nice. That's something at least
 Astrobytes: Nonsensical policy decision by the govt though, smh
 eulerscheZahl: and here i am with my biggest problem being that i have to suggest 4 ideas to improve processes and efficiency per year
 eulerscheZahl: your struggles make mine seem much smaller. i still hate it
 Astrobytes: 4 * per year: "Hire a minion for me"
 struct: Nice, stockfish court hearing is 4th of July
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2022/public-court-hearing-soon/">https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2022/public-court-hearing-soon/</a>
 struct: Hope they win&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: oh I almost forgot about that case
 Astrobytes: for sure
 jacek: huh
 Netsmile: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: jacek basicly they stole stockfish, called it has their own and sold it
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: who would buy chess engine
 Netsmile: why u no stay closed chatbar&#160;????
 jacek: its like buying for the papers
 struct: press on &gt;
 Astrobytes: heh 
 struct: or add ?disableChat to the end of url
 struct: jacek I guess chess players
 aCat: meh
 Netsmile: I turned it back the fak on just to come and say THANK YOU
 aCat: they should know how to play chess :D
 Astrobytes: lol, not wrong
 Netsmile: struct my hero
 aCat: people who don;t should need chess engines more ;p
 Netsmile: salut, farewell annoying chatbar wehehehehehehehheeeeeee
 Astrobytes: ^ really dislikes the chatbar 
 Astrobytes: my grandfather, a long time chess enthusiast, was (before his dementia) absolutely blown away by the power of chess engines these days
 Astrobytes: "you can get a decent game out of them!"
 eulerscheZahl: i removed the discord link in the chat bar via adblocker
 Astrobytes: is it really that annoying though?
 Lysk: oh good idea!
 Astrobytes: return total;
 Astrobytes: woops
 eulerscheZahl: it costs precious pixels of the chat
 eulerscheZahl: i like to have CG on one have of the screen and something else above or below
 struct: Im guessing astro followed your suggestion euler
 Astrobytes: hm?
 struct: coding in chat
 Astrobytes: haha
 Astrobytes: yes, was looking at the other screen and typing
 Astrobytes: not sure why I didn't catch it, might have been going to bed at 3.30am
 eulerscheZahl: 2 screens. that would also be a solution
 eulerscheZahl: but my desk isn't that big
 Astrobytes: I have 3 screens, but one is for an old noisy linux box and it's not on much
 Astrobytes: I use the laptop for that
 eulerscheZahl: hey, i'm next to smits now. similar strategy, similar rank
 Astrobytes: nice
 StevenV: csb
 Nerchio: I am cheering for every non c++ top player
 jacek: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry jacek, you don't count as top :P
 jacek: im busy writing pm in which i thank for the phone
 struct: "thanks for the phone"
 struct: Should be good enough
 ilgiocatore: so long, and thanks for all the phones
 srimanselvakumaran22: HGTTG reference yay
 eulerscheZahl: "thx 4 phone gg"
 Illedan: All your phone belongs to us
 Astrobytes: *are belong to us
 Illedan: Ah, that's why I'm not 1st
 Astrobytes: (correcting more or less correct language with bad translation-based nonsense)
 struct: also missing ez
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us</a>
 Astrobytes: ^
 Illedan: n Warcraft III, the single player instant victory cheat code is "AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs",
 struct: Those references are too old for me
 Illedan: I know it from WC3
 Astrobytes: wasn't there something similar in Warcraft 2?
 Astrobytes: can't remember the 90s too well in places
 Nerchio: show me the money
 jacek: :older_man:
 Astrobytes: lol SC or BW? or both?
 Nerchio: sc for sure, maybe both
 Astrobytes: I remember radio free zerg and power overwhelming
 Nerchio: ah i mean
 Nerchio: sc and maybe wc3 too
 Astrobytes: good times
 Nerchio: back when they made real games :older_man_tone1:
 Lassassin: hello
 Astrobytes: lol right :D
 Lassassin: so im trying to solve shadows of the knight episode 1
 Lassassin: i dont understand 1 thing
 Gr0mph: Hi,
 Lassassin: idk how to explain but, here's a pen
 jacek: :pen_ballpoint:
 Gr0mph: In Green Circle, is there any new rule after wood 1&#160;? 
 Lassassin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codepen.io/Lassassin/pen/qBxedNM">https://codepen.io/Lassassin/pen/qBxedNM</a>
 Lassassin: in the console
 jacek: Gr0mph yes
 Lassassin: idk why init X Y is 40 60 instead of 6 6
 Lassassin: even though i logged it out of the game loop
 Gr0mph: thanks jacek
 Gr0mph: In Batman, it's more easy If you have a min and max for x and a min and max for y. After it's easy.&#160;;)
 jacek: hmm your readlines differ from deafult code
 Lassassin: ah
 jacek: may be inconsistent
 Lassassin: i see
 Lassassin: im an idiot
 Lassassin: thanks!
 AshamanCooper: green circle was easier for me after wood.
 Astrobytes: AshamanCooper cause of all the random actions 
 kovi: gratz Yurko(mcts seems to be the winner)
 Astrobytes: vanilla mcts?
 struct: mcts? say no more
 Nerchio: i got bored after writing mcts once
 struct: Good thing I dont have to write it
 Astrobytes: Nerchio: it can be fun if it's a game you need to tweak and modify it a lot for
 DomiKo: Nerchio why would you write it again? just copy it :D 
 Nerchio: that's kinda what I did between uttt and connect4
 Nerchio: as i said - boring :D
 Astrobytes: try other kinds of mcts
 struct: I even have mcts for this kind of games where the player moves multiples turns
 struct: in ataxx
 Astrobytes: did ataxx get finished?
 eulerscheZahl: and still a python pulling off a brave fight
 struct: not yet
 Astrobytes: cool, I didn't miss anything
 Michael_Howard: How many got in Legend when it opened last time?
 eulerscheZahl: 15 or so
 eulerscheZahl: my bot is on the edge
 struct: why do you think its mcts kovi?
 eulerscheZahl: considering that there's still time to improve until legend
 eulerscheZahl: because it's Yurkov
 DomiKo: Yurkov have to be mcts
 DomiKo: everybody know this
 eulerscheZahl: one trick pony. but he does that one really well
 Astrobytes: smitsi or mcts, depending on the game, always :D
 Astrobytes: and yes, he does 
 Astrobytes: better at smitsi than smits :D
 struct: well I might give it a try I guess
 princess_of_zeal: I was wondering how predictable the rng is - anyone figured out how to crack the seed? I guess the benefits would be higher than for Spring Challenge?
 struct: you dont know what opponent did, I think its close to impossible
 Astrobytes: also the int vs float thing
 eulerscheZahl: use decimal [solved]
 princess_of_zeal: hm... but still, the rng state is basically given by the applications + opening hands, from there ...
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested to use SecureRandom. as intended by the SDK
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that it was changed to account for it. but still very much not trivial to reverse the seed
 princess_of_zeal: yeah, that's a one line fix, so cracking it might not be worth the effort&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: I don't thing Karan g reported back with anything useful
 princess_of_zeal: Agree that it's not trivial, but predicting all future draws and being able to identify plays that create bad draws for the opponent sounds like an unfair advantage. 
 jacek: nyoro~n
 eulerscheZahl: who cares about fairness? it's a contest
 MSmits: it's bad design, assuming it becomes a problem. don't think it has anything to do with fairness as every player has the opportunity to reverse the random if they have the skill and it is even possible
 struct: and its something that would take minutes to fix
 Astrobytes: Maybe get fixed in the multiplayer release
 MSmits: if this will be a multiplayer arena even
 jacek: it will
 Astrobytes: It will. I posted about it earlier
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: you posted? you make the rules?
 MSmits: i was doubting it because earlier company sponsored contests didnt
 Astrobytes: No euler, I posted about the fact it would come back :P cheeky git :D
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I think cause the SG guys are longterm users and they got SG to sponsor the contest, it's kinda almost a community contest
 jacek: svn?
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: hg
 Astrobytes: lol jacek, the actual meaning of 'git'
 MSmits: jacek means git?
 MSmits: :confused:
 eulerscheZahl: svn=subversionhg=mercurial
 Astrobytes: that would be jacek: the meaning of 'git' or jacek - the meaning of 'git'
 Dapps: cvs=
 MSmits: thanks for clearing that up (?) :P
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is an older Gangster In Training</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: git in an insult
 MSmits: are you training to  be an old gangster or have you grown old trying to be a gangster?
 Astrobytes: yes, people call Linus a grumpy/miserable git
 eulerscheZahl: that's how the versioning got the name. linus torvalds insulting others for their versioning system and telling them to use what he coded
 PatrickMcGinnisII: When I play by OG rules, I get in trouble ... gotta learn the new rules
 MSmits: is this where github came from?
 Astrobytes: where *git* came from
 Astrobytes: git&#160;!= github
 eulerscheZahl: what a git, isn't he?
 MSmits: i wouldn't know, i am not part of the git scene
 Astrobytes: it's a very English insult is 'git'
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair, i only found out about it when another student told me about the meaning
 eulerscheZahl: not a common word
 eulerscheZahl: it's in one league with idiot i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for version collections, I prefer Gangster In Training
 MSmits: I'm definitely overfitting parameters now. I spent a few hrs on having specific parameters per card and now i set them all equal and my bot is just as good
 Astrobytes: It's very common in English, in Scotland we might use 'get' instead of 'git'
 Astrobytes: (in the insult form)
 Astrobytes: I thought you were looking elsewhere from the parameter tweaking MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah, i have been putting it off, i am a bit tired. Should have just gotten some sleep 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes is a cheeky git, oic
 Astrobytes: Yes Patrick, that's the one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dumbass ameericans
 Astrobytes: I can forgive "git good" etc usage, accent-dependent 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the longer the insult, the more it should hit
 Astrobytes: like "mangled apricot hellbeast"?
 Quidome: Is bronze containing all the rules?
 Astrobytes: Yes Quidome
 Quidome: thnxs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: umm, yea...nerds shouldn't rap
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: it was a Scottish insult towards The Donald
 MSmits: it's the duck Astrobytes
 MSmits: he's not donald
 PatrickMcGinnisII: truck frump
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: o that donald
 Astrobytes: *that* donald, yes
 jacek: does he have trump card
 Astrobytes: also from Scotland about him: "leather-faced piss jar", "weapons-grade plum", "custard-falvoured jobby" etc
 Astrobytes: *flavoured
 PatrickMcGinnisII: more like this for nerds "yo momma gotta stop taking selfies, Google Earth is getting overloaded."
 Astrobytes: Yo mama jokes are not dead yet?
 jacek: theyll never be
 Astrobytes: said yo mama
 MSmits: Yo mama so fat, she's wedged in between Ben Nevis and Suilven
 Astrobytes: Not bad MSmits!
 MSmits: thx
 Astrobytes: That must have took some googling
 MSmits: indeed
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII went over his head</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: Scottish mountains Patrick
 MSmits: (i googled mountains in Scotland)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er my head
 Astrobytes: what is that about 100-150 miles distance MSmits?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm going to D.C. next month, I wonder if the wax museum has a custard-flavoured jobby
 MSmits: could be sure
 MSmits: i didn't measure yo mama precisely
 Astrobytes: MSmits: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: excellent
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: Please, do ask them this question
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Voldemort won't even call u momma by name
 Astrobytes: who?
 Astrobytes: oh the Harry Potter character
 Astrobytes: I still don't know what one that is, and I've seen the movies casually many times
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I call my X wife VB, for Voldebitch
 MSmits: to her face?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, HP reference
 Astrobytes: Could stand for Visual Basic, 2 sides of the same coin
 MSmits: yeah the one that must not be coded in
 Astrobytes: it was handy around 2001
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i still can't get out of silver with 1 move heuristics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least my move sim is debugged
 MSmits: if you can be sure your sim has no bugs, you're at least 1 step ahead of me :P
 MSmits: or do you just mean the move phase
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't play the 0 1 2 3 type cards tho
 MSmits: ah, those are pretty good. Well the first 2 anyways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was computing debt wrong...forever
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only 0 depth analysis i can think to add is picking releases that could slow down opponent the most
 MSmits: please dont do that
 MSmits: waste of time even if you do it very accurately like i did
 Nerchio: don't do that it's my secret strat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u in gold nerch?
 Nerchio: somehow yeah
 Nerchio: my sister helped me code
 MSmits: i calculated every possible hand for opponent and how close to every possible app the opponent could get with his current deck, given a random hand
 MSmits: gave that a parameter
 MSmits: and it fitted to 0. Many times
 Astrobytes: Nerchio trolling also on point
 Dapps: MSmits lol hate that feeling
 Nerchio: can't get rusty Astrobytes
 MSmits: yeah it sucks, i really thought this must be useful
 Astrobytes: indeed Nerchio, indeed!
 MSmits: the problem is that you have no idea about the division between his draw and discard piles
 MSmits: so it's just noise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: opponents beat me to 5 apps many times i think because i choose the wrong release, they tie via eval of my hand quite often
 kovi: i do since day 3, it works in certain situation
 DefaultCoder: lol
 MSmits: if you can identify the situation and only put it in eval for that situation, then it is good
 DefaultCoder: i cant find the sulotion
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or i end up in situations where i have too many cards
 MSmits: what kind of lotion is that DefaultCoder?
 MSmits: and why are you asking us?
 Astrobytes: sun-unblocking I think
 MSmits: oh that makes sense
 Astrobytes: in the way that chocolate teapots make sense, yes
 MSmits: they don't make sense
 Astrobytes: precisely
 MSmits: ohhhhh
 Astrobytes: quit playing sub :P
 Astrobytes: sub?!
 Astrobytes: *dumb
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i tighten debt collection in early game and loosen it in end game.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There is a chocolate teabag joke in therre somewhere
 MSmits: yeah i was gonna ask what you mean by sub, but i didnt want to seem dumb
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: I think only if you include my 'sub' typo
 Astrobytes: MSmits: :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: r u actually getting much depth MSmits?
 MSmits: I do a full search of my turn
 MSmits: from move to release
 Nerchio: depth == 1 :laughing:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now that sim is debugged was gonna mcts, or modify to accomodate for picking neighbor skill cards
 MSmits: depends on how you define depth :P
 Astrobytes: in PHP Patrick?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depth, back to u momma highlands
 MSmits: he's gonna squeeze the max out of his 100 rollouts Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: but there's a python in top 10, so no worries PatrickMcGinnisII, just don't mcts it
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: I really hope we can keep the same banter going on discord after the chat removal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: swapping skills does work in endgame, hmmm
 MSmits: I will go there
 MSmits: you mean task prio PatrickMcGinnisII?
 Astrobytes: It won't be the same but we can try
 MSmits: if everyone is there, it could be better
 MSmits: discord has more functionality doesnt it?
 Astrobytes: it does yes
 MSmits: the only reason this chat is good is the people, as a chat program it is horrible
 Astrobytes: but it's not as immediate as CG chat, separate window/tab etc
 MSmits: good work for an itern ofc
 MSmits: true
 Astrobytes: I will miss a lot of the FR people that don't  use discord too
 MSmits: what do they use?
 Nerchio: baguettes
 Astrobytes: CG webchat
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: chat plugin of vim
 Astrobytes: yes, baguettes connected by raclette strands
 Westicles: there's always blaise's chat
 Astrobytes: not ready yet iirc
 Astrobytes: Are you on discord Westicles?
 Astrobytes: I can't remember if you are or not
 Westicles: yeah, but I rarely use it
 Astrobytes: get using it after the chat goes
 Westicles: yeah, probably.  
 Westicles: looks like he's made some progress
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cheloniangall.com">https://cheloniangall.com</a>
 Astrobytes: I thought the name was most excellent.
 MSmits: what does it mean
 Astrobytes: I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader (so to speak)
 MSmits: I'm just going to visit that site regularly to chuckle at the dancing turtle
 Astrobytes: there's a connection between the turtle and the name. 
 TheQuestion: Hello, quick question about the running contest. It is not possible to use a skill card only for its shoddy skill icons? (sorry if its in the description, i cant find it)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: awe
 BrunoFelthes: it is possible TheQuestion
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes u can use just the shoddy part
 MSmits: if you end up using cards just for the shoddy, you're probably not making a good decision there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: right now my bot takes on 10 debt in 4 releases and has a hard timer getting the 5th out in time
 BrunoFelthes: some times it is good MSmits
 MSmits: sometimes using shoddy is good
 MSmits: but the correct cards already have shoddy
 BrunoFelthes: just let the search engine decide about it
 MSmits: if you are also using incorrect cards it means you are using over 4 shoddy
 MSmits: so 5+
 MSmits: that's never a good idea
 TheQuestion: hm, ok, thanks. then i have to dig around. i have a hand with 4 skills, and releasing an app thows an error, though just the shoddy skills should be enough (i get it, not a good choice, still surprised it fails)
 Astrobytes: Patrick: check if you have the proper cards, use shoddy earlier if necessary, not later
 TheQuestion: small app
 Astrobytes: you can always delay RELEASE with WAIT
 Westicles: you do all that Patrick and you are only a little ahead of my move+1
 MSmits: probably he has a bug
 MSmits: or 2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I eval the moves fairly well to fit with app requirements.  tuned the throw command a bit
 Astrobytes: I do, I know that much
 Astrobytes: have bugs I mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i hate throwing stuff away tho
 MSmits: think of it as throwing stuff toward
 Astrobytes: the path to success is littered with stuff thrown forward
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i try to make sure i don't pass admin desk too many times
 MSmits: very wise
 MSmits: both of you
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: playing against myself i avg. around 135 frames...that's way too high
 Cpt_Asura: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/24751444bf5125bf1fc59bd4afb906d7f68181d">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/24751444bf5125bf1fc59bd4afb906d7f68181d</a>
 Astrobytes: Patrick: ffs fk the frames, win
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i bet MSmits avgs about 85 or less
 Westicles: patrick do you start with MOVE 4,5,6,7?  
 Astrobytes: that doesn't sound helpful
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i strt with just evaling 0 1 2 3, but they usually tie, so 0 wins
 Westicles: well, no wonder.  gotta start with 4
 TheQuestion: Ok, maybe i am just too tired, but i would assume that with the following hand, i should be able to release any app. What am i misunderstanding in the rules? "TheQuestion has in hand: 4, 9, 0, 3, 2"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if opponent chooses 6...kinda screws it up tho
 jacek: 5th app?
 TheQuestion: oh, of course. too tired it is
 TheQuestion: *facepalm*
 TheQuestion: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll try Westicles
 MSmits: start with 5 and automate a bonus card
 struct: The secret is to not even start
 Astrobytes: Green - not even once
 Astrobytes: (multi-layered joke yo)
 Westicles: how can you joke with polio in your stools?
 MSmits: stools?
 MSmits: the things we sit on or the things we produce sitting?
 Sheeesh---: the secret is to dream the solution
 MSmits: either way doesnt make sense
 Westicles: the latter
 MSmits: o
 Astrobytes: well it's transmitted easily via stool contact
 MSmits: I haven't contacted people's stool lately
 Nerchio: xdd
 jacek: Automaton2000 what is stool?
 Automaton2000: i was looking at the code and it shows the script?if so that would be so much better
 MSmits: it's so lifelike, I think it's gotten sentient
 MSmits: let me message google about it
 Astrobytes: get one of them to send a memo about it
 Astrobytes: (them == google employees that is)
 MSmits: yes we will include some poliostool trivia
 Astrobytes: Wonder what that 'sentient' google chatbot will think about this
 MSmits: I think it will scramble its neurons
 MSmits: deconverge
 MSmits: diverge
 MSmits:&#160;! i thought of a new word
 Astrobytes: deconverge is nice
 Astrobytes: it's like "unfresh"
 jacek: not so new <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deconvergence">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deconvergence</a>
 MSmits: did you just create a new wiki in 5 seconds jacek&#160;?
 MSmits: there's suspiciously little in there
 Astrobytes: jacek: but as in "unfresh" it's not common parlance
 Scarfield: This page was last edited on 3 May 2021, at 12:49
 jacek: just dont look at the history
 jacek: :rage:
 MSmits: I am a year late&#160;:(
 Scarfield: this chat bot, its getting pretty good at exactly what its trained for, must be sentient
 Astrobytes: something is making really weird barking noises and I'm not sure if it's a dog being hurt or the autistic boy from a few houses along (seriously)
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: maybe they are chatting
 MSmits: if I was hearing that I'd look here:
 Astrobytes: It's the boy I think. All good, mystery solved.

 Astrobytes: I did get 6 hours MSmits :D
 MSmits: o ok
 Astrobytes: Scary sounds nonetheless.
 Astrobytes: MSmits: when you are really sleep-deprived shadow-people are a thing
 Scarfield: but what about crab people
 MSmits: maybe they are always a thing and you can only see them when you are sleep deprived
 Westicles: and then there's the hag
 MSmits: yo momma
 Scarfield: oof
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: well played
 Astrobytes: and on topic
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: yo momma jokes were earlier in the chat :D
 Scarfield: oh, i missed out then&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: in fact, yo momma's jokes were there
 MSmits: yup
 Scarfield: my momma jokes?
 Astrobytes: Nope. The jokes from yo momma
 Astrobytes: ANYWAY. Are you still playing Green Thing Scarfield?
 MSmits: is that what the youth is calling it now
 MSmits: what is Green Thing?
 Astrobytes: you missed my Green - not even once joke clearly MSmits
 Astrobytes: Green Circle
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: i am tired
 Scarfield: not really, my simple bot got pushed to silver, tried making some simple improvements, but made it worse. and havent had the energy to make something serious
 MSmits: some parts of brain work, some don't
 Astrobytes: Understandable. MSmits and Scarfield both
 Scarfield: yo mommas brain so small its only one part
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Scarfield: my bot prefers passing the admin table, and i havent bothered to find the bug
 Astrobytes: yo mamas head so small she got her ears pierced and died
 MSmits: ouch
 MSmits: this is why I never had that done
 Astrobytes: your head ain't THAT small FFS!
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: hey, i have imagination
 Scarfield: who dies their ears?
 MSmits: no not dyed
 MSmits: died
 Astrobytes: that would be dye not die
 Scarfield: ah
 Scarfield: dammit
 MSmits: your misunderstanding of the joke is funnier than the joke Scarfield
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert meme of kids dancing around pointing at you going wooooooo&gt;
 Scarfield: not even in past tense did that work
 Astrobytes: MSmits: rofl:
 Astrobytes: or :rofl:
 Astrobytes: take your pick
 MSmits: :pick:
 Astrobytes: en garde!
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: :crossed_swords:
 MSmits: what is up struct
 struct: asserts saved me
 Scarfield: was helping a colleague with a test setup, he asked me (about a wire) to "take it out and pull in it", i had to explain how i "misunderstood" what he said, kinda killed the joke
 MSmits: I've never used an assert
 struct: why not?
 Scarfield: only dessert
 MSmits: there is no why
 MSmits: i havent considered them
 struct: They will catch the bugs for you
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: rofl: excellent
 struct: I was sending index -1
 MSmits: i always just error print
 struct: the assert catches it
 Astrobytes: I give up on rofling, i'll just rofl in text
 MSmits: if(x has wrong value) print x
 struct: well assert does the same
 struct: just in fewer lines
 MSmits: yeah, i should try it
 Astrobytes: assert(x&#160;!= reasonable_value) 
 Astrobytes: x ==
 struct: and then you can do ctrl F to replace assert( by //assert(
 struct: problem solved
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: struct: #define NDEBUG
 Westicles: yo momma assert when she fall down
 struct: Yeah should work too
 Scarfield: yo momma so big the earth falls up
 MSmits: noticably
 Astrobytes: yo mommas ass[ert] so big she got mo' crack than Harlem
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: (can't remember where that's from, not mine)
 Scarfield: i wish there were a yomo mma club
 Scarfield: York Mountain MMA, YOMOMMA
 Astrobytes: Or a fanclub of your momma. YOMOMMA
 Astrobytes: (I liked your one better)
 Scarfield: so did chuck norris

 Scarfield: xD you ran out of debt cards 
 struct: and bonus
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: i thought 100 was some randomly high number you couldnt reach
 struct: lol
 struct: 2 lines eval beats my bot
 struct: ill run brutal just to test
 Astrobytes: was afk, Scarfield I have a book of Chuck Norris vs Mr T jokes
 Astrobytes: emh: more bourbon obviously
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: lol
 struct: MSmits do you have any idea how to remove the error messages when you run brutaltester?
 Astrobytes: don't run it
 Astrobytes: [solved]
 Scarfield: assert
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: sec
 Astrobytes: is that the log4j thing?
 MSmits: src/test/resources/log4j2.propertiesrootLogger.level = warn
 MSmits: instead of info
 Astrobytes: what Smits said
 struct: do I need to create that directory?
 MSmits: no the file is there
 MSmits: it's just a line to change
 struct: ah
 struct: ok
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: rootLogger.level = info becomes rootLogger.level = warn
 Astrobytes: it's since the fix cause of that large log4j exploit a while ago I believe
 MSmits: just to be clear, i know nothing of how any of this works. I am just copy pasting what yurko said
 struct: hmm didnt work for me
 struct: That worked for euler referee?
 MSmits: maybe they are different messages
 MSmits: euler has a different thing
 Astrobytes: don't worry MSmits, I'm java-useless too
 MSmits: i am using something different
 struct: ah
 Astrobytes: it's not a breaking error struct
 Astrobytes: or shouldn't be
 struct: its fine yeah
 Astrobytes: just annoying
 Astrobytes: if you want pretty output you know where the | is
 Scarfield: im gonna bounce, enjoy your evening folks&#160;:)

 struct: 8 would break my bot :D
 Astrobytes: argh, my eyes
 struct: github?
 Astrobytes: the java

 Astrobytes: that's horrid
 Astrobytes: got my github on dark, same as windows, same as CG
 struct: same
 BrunoFelthes: WoW, wala is leading with Java :D
 Astrobytes: wala is a beast with java
 wala: thanks
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 struct: petition to remove java
 BrunoFelthes: Yeah, I know... I'm always the 2nd or 3th... I used to be the 1st before wala... he have a great framework
 Astrobytes: struct: It would be wala you'd have to remove lol
 BrunoFelthes: top 10 -&gt; 1 Java 9 C++
 struct: why solve 1 problem when I can solve multiple?
 Astrobytes: :D
 BrunoFelthes: what is the secret wala?
 Astrobytes: Nice. I expect a few other languages to pop up in the end 
 Sheeesh---: Bash
 wala: BrunoFelthes i did the same thing as in the framework
 Astrobytes: BrunoFelthes: you should check some pm's and tips given in various threads
 BrunoFelthes: MCTS?
 wala: beam search
 BrunoFelthes: nice
 Astrobytes: Beam, interesting.
 MSmits: weird, with the probabilities
 struct: why MSmits?
 struct: you can still take into account probabilities
 Astrobytes: Not if you include them as states
 MSmits: well you don't have a definite state
 Astrobytes: and can rule out a few
 Astrobytes: I guess
 MSmits: you have to rule out millions if you want to go deep
 wala: yes the draws induce sometimes wrong actions
 Astrobytes: sure, that seems reasonable
 MSmits: I'll start on a new bot tomorrow, this bot has reached max potential
 Astrobytes: and I don't think going tooo deep is overly beneficial
 wala: Astrobytes i think that  too
 MSmits: you still need eval then
 MSmits: that's hard
 MSmits: i kinda liked the idea of MC till end of game
 struct: and ignore opponent?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: just make a draw pile for him and go
 Astrobytes: isn't that what psyho was doing?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i like the method
 Astrobytes: ouch, sorry for the ping
 MSmits: i feel like i'll just get stuck on eval again if i do a beamsearch or other search with limited depth
 Astrobytes: fix your static evaluation heuristic skills MSmits
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I went from 25 to 10 params today
 struct: I dont even think I can call what im doing bitboards tbh
 MSmits: bot is the same rank
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 struct: Im just using the bits as info
 Astrobytes: struct: keeping data packed in ints isn't bitboarding
 struct: Im doing 5 * 8 bits for skills, 8 bonus 8 tech 8 size
 struct: I guess
 MSmits: yeah thats what i was gonna do, but barely worth the effort
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's just being economical
 struct: It wasnt too much work tbh
 MSmits: if i go try that MC thing it's just using a single state anyway, not storing
 MSmits: no the coding isnt much work, finding the one bug i put in during the coding is the work
 struct: Yeah that is truth
 struct: Thats what asserts are for :p
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: heh heh indeed
 MSmits: anyway, i should sleep now
 struct: imagine that I wrote -1 on my data
 struct: it would be deadly
 Astrobytes: doesn't catch those legal bugs you make though
 struct: gn
 MSmits: will focus on coding tomorrow, see you on sunday prolly
 MSmits: gn
 Illedan: gn
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits just get some rest either way
 MSmits: yep thanks
 Illedan: Had an idea with 60&#160;% winrate offline. Instant submit... 10 more min of training =&gt; 40&#160;% -.-
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: Like I said earlier, don't submit! :grin:
 Illedan: Can't even conclude on 100 games with this contest -.-
 BrunoFelthes: I just dont know how to debug my code, it is annoying with this game rules

 Astrobytes: very bad time to ask Manchi
 Manchi_o6o7: if I can make it easier, it's line 15. which doesn't allow me to call the function
 Astrobytes: we're working on a contest
 Astrobytes: == bad time to ask
 Manchi_o6o7: ouu sorry
 Astrobytes: play the contest instead, 4-ish days left :D
 Sheeesh---: and it's fun
 Astrobytes: in a masochistic kjnd of way at first but fun yes
 Astrobytes: *kind
 Twelve0: why everyone in silver has 500 games in Last battles?
 Twelve0: oh or is it the limit that is shown 
 Nerchio: limit
 Neumann: Games get cleaned from servers afterwards, only the 500 last ones are available
 Astrobytes: o/
 Neumann: 'sup
 Astrobytes: how you doing dude, been a while
 Neumann: Casually trying to make something out of this contest
 Neumann: So far&#160;: meh
 Neumann: And you&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hehe, it's a 'different' contest
 Neumann: Aren't they all, in a way
 Astrobytes: yeah, trying to do something, I might just give up in gold
 Neumann: Gold is nice already
 Wontonimo: i hear whisper that there is a cheese method of getting to silver.  Anyone feel like enlightening me 
 Astrobytes: I don't think that works any more Wontonimo
 struct: hi Wontonimo there was a time that printing first action worked
 struct: not sure anymore
 Astrobytes: but using that and some smarts might work, not sure
 Astrobytes: I feel like the only person who didn't go to silver doing that
 Astrobytes: or bronze for that matter
 Astrobytes: You can try Westicles MOVE +1 or first action I guess
 elderlybeginner: Do you have some basic heuristic ideas, that are simple and make difference in the contest?
 elderlybeginner: escpecially in play and release phase
 Astrobytes: déjà vu from last night!
 Astrobytes: Release phase, careful what you release and with what cards
 Astrobytes: *and when
 elderlybeginner: that "when" I just base on debt cost
 Astrobytes: remember WAIT is also an option in RELEASE phase
 Astrobytes: yes
 elderlybeginner: and releaseing the cheapest one
 Astrobytes: that's good but you can get away with a couple of expensive ones if needed
 elderlybeginner: when it's below 4
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah
 Astrobytes: doing the same
 elderlybeginner: THROW_CARD and GIVE_CARD - is there any easy gain with opposite to random?
 Astrobytes: well, throw your least needed cards and give away the ones that you don't need/aren't going to use/won't give the other player some advantage I guess
 Astrobytes: a combination of the above really
 elderlybeginner: that's sounds like scoring function for value of the cards at certain phase
 Astrobytes: well that's essentially correct
 elderlybeginner: but there should be "lower hanging fruits"
 ilgiocatore: yep, you can just automate bonus cards as much as you can
 Astrobytes: I think we harvested them all by this point in silver. 
 Astrobytes: Yes there is bonus automation
 ilgiocatore: and nothing else matters
 ilgiocatore: in silver
 ilgiocatore: and in lower gold league
 elderlybeginner: automating bonus is better then automating anything else?
 ilgiocatore: yes
 ilgiocatore: it makes sense to automated other cards only in the end of the game
 ilgiocatore: i think
 elderlybeginner: eh, I see I have it already implemented 
 Astrobytes: yeah, it depends on other factors or it was OP at the time
 elderlybeginner: any easy fix for moving shortest, but not getting into 'disturb'
 Astrobytes: skipping the admin desk?
 electroshardz: Can someone explain this to me? I haven't seen it before:
 electroshardz: s=input().split()a,b=s.count('COWS'),s.count('MILK')print([a,"no"][a==b],b)
 Astrobytes: or just opponent?
 electroshardz: print([a,"no"][a==b],b)
 electroshardz: it was a conditional statement where everyone else had if, then
 elderlybeginner: skipping opponet +1
 Astrobytes: electroshardz: it's just a different way of writing it
 electroshardz: I don't understand... if a == b , then&#160;?
 elderlybeginner: gives you [True/False] which is [1/0]
 Astrobytes: elderlybeginner: check if they're either at the desk or nearby to the desk (by some number of desks) can work
 elderlybeginner: which makes index
 yanamal: a if a=b else "no"&#160;?..
 yanamal: rather, a if a==b else "no"&#160;?..
 yanamal: is apparently equivalent to [a,"no"][a==b]
 electroshardz: ok, why is it list literals thats why I am confused.
 electroshardz: pretty sweet have to say
 Astrobytes: because snake things
 elderlybeginner: a = 'no' if a==b else a
 Astrobytes: also hi yanamal, don't recall seeing you since was it the Kutulu contest?
 electroshardz: so for ex: [there, not there][smart == me], else?????
 yanamal: my god. they are using a boolean as a list index.
 yanamal: Hey Astrobytes, good memory!
 Astrobytes: remembered the profile pic tbh!
 yanamal: I went to grad school and was too busy to accidentally sink weeks into competitions
 yanamal: well, still am, but I relapsed
 Astrobytes: This was a clash right electroshardz?
 elderlybeginner: smart == me gives you True or False, which is 1 or 0, so e.g. if you get 1 (True) then ['there', 'not there'][1] gives you 'not there'
 electroshardz: ohhhh. like this:[me, "haha"][smart==me],"Nope"
 electroshardz: yeah. haha
 Astrobytes: yanamal: awesome, you missed the spring contest! Few and far between are these contests these days
 electroshardz: elderly, I guess I am confused on the last part:print([a,"no"][a==b],b)the , b
 yanamal: Ah, I guess I got lucky. I was showing the easy puzzles to someone I was tutoring and saw the current contest and got hooked again. oopsie.
 yanamal: (and/or unlucky about the spring contest).
 elderlybeginner: Oh, MOVE 0 is bad move
 Astrobytes: yanamal: whatever you do never look at clist.by
 Astrobytes: MOVE 0 is a bad move if you're on 7
 yanamal: electroshardz  the ,b is just a separate independent print, you can print several comma-separated things
 yanamal: Astrobytes  oh dear. well I'm too lazy for contests that make me jump through too many hoops to get started anyway. I tried a couple game contests on Kaggle but got distracted too easily.
 electroshardz: Ok, just not sure how that would back sence for that clash to always print b, as it wouldn't pass all possible cases. Thanks yanamal and others for the help.
 Astrobytes: yanamal heh heh, yeah, that's where CG has the upper hand. Topcoder Marathons are nice (optimization games) and we have russian AI cup in July, that's easy enough to  get started with depending how many pages there are in the rules PDF&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Both have an offline runner executable though, which is nice
 Astrobytes: electroshardz: Gives you something to practice and learn more about&#160;;)
 yanamal: Astrobytes good to know in case I ever want to get kicked out of grad school for spending too much time writing ai bots&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: [Kaggle is a mess (imo) btw]
 yanamal: haha agree.
 Astrobytes: yanamal: why not spend all your downtime doing things you love? :D
 Astrobytes: but seriously, yeah, grad school first
 elderlybeginner: the contest description is far from being clear
 yanamal: electroshardz you can try learning more about the "ternary if operator" in python, and see if that makes more sense in place of the weird list expression
 elderlybeginner: what iniciate "THROW_CARD" phase?
 elderlybeginner: and is it worth to omit it always?
 yanamal: what is this "downtime" you speak of? 
 Astrobytes: any time you need to discard a card
 Astrobytes: yanamal: hehehe right on :DWhat you studying?
 yanamal: Technically, computer science. In practice, it's a lot more social science than I like because I have chosen to go into human-computer interaction. 
 Astrobytes: HCI is cool though. We need a lot more outstanding understanding of that in the field of technology if you ask me.
 Astrobytes: You can't leave it to devs
 Nerchio: if my draw is 0 and i try to draw it takes discard yeah?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah Nerchio, it puts discard pile into draw and shuffles it
 struct: and if its 1 and you use training
 struct: it gets the 1 from draw and then 1 from discard
 Nerchio: danke schon
 Astrobytes: A Pole thanking a Scot and Portuguese in German
 yanamal: yeah. but writing HCI papers and actually getting them accepted to HCI conferences is a pain, especially if I also try to squeeze in things that are actually important to me, not just things that will make my paper look acceptable in the eyes of HCI reviewers.
 Astrobytes: yanamal: that's the problem of research.
 yanamal: yep. My parents tried to warn me. and now they like to remind me of this fact.
 Astrobytes: Beginning of the end. Get out while you can.
 Astrobytes: Finish, it looks great on paper. Then go do what you want to do.
 yanamal: yeah, that's the plan I think. I definitely do not want to do the pyramid scheme of academia.
 Astrobytes: No. It's terrible. I mastered in cell biology, the whole world of research is exactly the same.
 Astrobytes: struct: you should petition CG to keep the chat since people are coming back to the site
 struct: What power do I have?
 Astrobytes: Infinite Mod Power ofc
 Astrobytes: Didn't they give you that?
 struct: Best case scenario was the chat to be back during contests I guess
 struct: at least
 Astrobytes: Yeah. That would require a certain level of what might be called 'maintenance' though
 struct: or just dont let any new user have access to chat
 struct: :p
 struct: It think its  an hard decision 
 struct: The chat has been great lately but before it was really bad
 struct: But its not really "our" fault
 Astrobytes: The *reason* the chat was terrible (other than lack of features) was really lack of *new content* ie.  events I think
 Astrobytes: *mod features
 Astrobytes: when it was more regular there was less nonsense, and if there was it moved too fast to be noticed
 Astrobytes: I get their decision though, when it's bad it's almost uncontrollable
 struct: for me it would stay 
 struct: It was only bad for a few weeks 
 Astrobytes: I don't miss modding but I did change my mind about the chat
 Astrobytes: it gets worse with school terms and seasons, I feel there are other ways it could be controlled, but who am I to question the CoderPad
 struct: Step 1, make chat open source, 2nd make comunity do it
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: If they were never bought by a large company I feel they might have done that at some point. It won't happen now though
 Astrobytes: large *US* company
 Astrobytes: anyway, time for a couple of beers before bed, see ya tomorrow

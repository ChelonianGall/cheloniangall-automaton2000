 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes is that where you all learnt othello minimax from?
 karliso: othello is minimax or mcts game?
 WINWINWIN: Not sure how to tell, havent learnt mcts fully
 Astrobytes: Not seen that before WINWINWIN
 Astrobytes: karliso, mostly it's minimax, but tomatoes is having some success with MCTS (with EPT)
 Astrobytes: dbd r is top and has multi prob cut
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN looks like the guy in that paper combined MCTS, alphabeta and NN
 WINWINWIN: MCTS handles a larger branching better right?
 karliso: Depends

 jacek: though im using UCB for selection
 Astrobytes: MCab
 Astrobytes: Or something
 Astrobytes: Are you also using that for Oware now jacek?
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: Nice, was a good improvement
 jacek: i think this is roughly equivalent for mcts with 0 depth EPT if you use eval directly instead of propagating win/lose
 Astrobytes: Yeah it seems on par with it
 jacek: so im using this in three Os: othello, oware, onitama
 Astrobytes: Useful alg-O
 struct: What made you discover this?
 struct: Othello?
 jacek: i started fiddling with mcts, for othello, yes
 jacek: i have rather mature eval now, so why not
 jacek: i surprised its quite stable given very volatile nature of othello

 WINWINWIN: ninja252esko is that the codingame sponsored challenge?
 Astrobytes: looks like it, yeah
 Hjax: so many submits Astrobytes
 Hjax: pushed me above the ninja
 Astrobytes: Playing around when I should really be working Hjax :D
 Astrobytes: oh hey, Marchete joined us
 struct: oh it was fast
 struct: I saw him at wood 2
 jacek: legend in 1 submit?
 DuongCongSon: hi
 DuongCongSon: hello gus
 DuongCongSon: who is play clash of code?
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: still not enough
 struct: wood 1 seems to strong
 Hjax: isnt Marchete good at these sorts of games 
 Hjax: *im in danger* 
 Astrobytes: It's certainly a challenging league, which is fine
 Marchete: board games? no
 Marchete: I barely have opening books and stuff
 Hjax: rank 4, im going to say youre good at everything 
 Marchete: not really
 Hjax: :P
 Astrobytes: Didn't see you around for a while Marchete
 Marchete: yes
 Astrobytes: All good?
 Marchete: I connect sometimes, but in stalker mode
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)

 Washier: Nice work Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Nah, it's no better than earlier. The one at last place was broken
 Astrobytes: thx anyway tho&#160;:)
 Marchete: dbd_r is minimax, or smth fancier?
 XuanAnh: hello
 Washier: haha, ok, interesting
 Astrobytes: yeah, minimax but he uses multi probcut
 Astrobytes: Very well
 tomatoes: +
 Marchete: "multi probcut" another invented acronym I need to read about...
 CiBou: heyy can someone explain to me (cause i'm new in this site) how does it work, what can we do here and how&#160;?
 CiBou: thanks
 Astrobytes: You'll find it on chessprogramming Marchete
 CiBou: where is it&#160;?
 CiBou: the chess...
 CiBou: programing
 Marchete: CiBou this site is for competitive programming and puzzles
 Marchete: it doesn't learn you to code
 Marchete: it's more about solving problems, creating AI's that compete against other AI's, etc.
 WINWINWIN: Of course there are excellent resources to learn here, it`s just that learning is not the primary focus
 Uljahn: why do you need explanation when you can explore things by yourself? click the unclickable, solve the unsolvable :upside_down:
 Uljahn: btw is Automaton2000 ded yet?
 Automaton2000: so you could try to use it
 Uljahn: ah that's just for ru channel
 Hjax: did Automaton2000 speak russian in the ru channel?
 Automaton2000: with a list of all possible moves in a row
 Uljahn: yes, when online

 AntiSquid: hello wonderful people, how's it going?
 strattan: Hi!
 TheSpiffiest: Man if this site could throw in some networking problems it would be perfect training for a job.&#160;:)
 heavygabriel: backend guy?
 TheSpiffiest: I'm learning so much looking at the finished code from others when I'm done.
 TheSpiffiest: Full Stack, so everything
 TheSpiffiest: Screen to metal
 heavygabriel: bruh you should see my code in temperatures
 heavygabriel: legit redneck
 heavygabriel: also I'm running in optimisation errors
 heavygabriel: (send help)
 TheSpiffiest: Still learning, but big interviews this week so rying to stay sharp
 heavygabriel: now I'm trying to figure out why doesn't my data save
 TheSpiffiest: Google and Amazon... kinda stressed I'm gonna flub it
 heavygabriel: since it always stays the same
 heavygabriel: you're lucky that you can get interviews though
 TheSpiffiest: Can you save data on here?
 heavygabriel: no but I mean like passing data
 heavygabriel: you know when you do a loop and want to have data outside of that loop?
 TheSpiffiest: right
 heavygabriel: it doesn't do that
 TheSpiffiest: rust?
 heavygabriel: no
 heavygabriel: C#
 TheSpiffiest: I don't know... I usually swap languages when I run into stuff that doesn't work the way I want it to
 nitekat: I'm new to Python and I try to play CoC only using Python, tbh I learnt a lot funny and effective ways to solve problem by others sharing their code, so maybe... a weird and also a funny way to learn new language lol
 TheSpiffiest: python is lazier about that, javascript too
 TheSpiffiest: I've been playing using Bash
 TheSpiffiest: it's silly
 TheSpiffiest: Ruby for code golf though, you can always drop a few chars
 TheSpiffiest: but C# should have no problem with variables outside a for loop. Possibly if they are static class level, but if defined inside a function it shouldn't matter
 heavygabriel: it's a double loop
 heavygabriel: IE it has do first
 heavygabriel: foreach second
 Hjax: Astrobytes its interesting that your stronger submits seem to do worse against me 
 heavygabriel: ooh
 Astrobytes: Nothing works in my submits the way I think it's going to :P
 heavygabriel: ok so foreach gives the last instance or something, so that shit doesn't save
 Hjax: are you just tweaking your eval?
 Astrobytes: Not just eval no, trying a few things out
 Astrobytes: As you may have noticed, I've been mostly unsuccessful so far :D
 Hjax: keep pushing me up please :P
 Hjax: no i lost one D: 
 struct: Still no NN&#160;:(
 struct: I wanted to know if it would work
 jacek: put a bounty on NN
 struct: 10€ to whoever gets 1st with NN
 jacek: how can you verify? dbdr could say his bot is NN
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure if i recognize a NN when i see one
 TheSpiffiest: CodinGame is way better than HackerRank, but Amazon uses HackerRank for interviews... you guys gotta get your sales team or something talking to them.&#160;:)
 struct: I will trust the player
 eulerscheZahl: like the story behind the name of linear programming
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: for classic puzzles i even prefer hackerrank.animated puzzles and multiplayer games is where CG shines
 eulerscheZahl: hm? hm?
 Astrobytes: So Uncle Euler, tell us the story behind the name of linear programming
 struct: jacek if you get rank you just need to tell me its NN
 struct: I will believe
 eulerscheZahl: ohit's actually more of a mathematical than a programming problem. but programming got more funding at that time
 eulerscheZahl: so just call it "programming", as those in charge won't understand it anyways
 Astrobytes: Ah right, isn't that same as the dynamic programming term
 eulerscheZahl: or did I confuse the story of those two?
 Astrobytes: No I think they're both along the same lines
 jacek: is this like a story of jacek programming?
 eulerscheZahl: entertain us jacek :popcorn:
 jacek: its simply writing random code until it works
 eulerscheZahl: there's the infinite monkey theorem
 Astrobytes: Surely applies to algorithms too
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, we already modified it to the infinite MK theorem
 eulerscheZahl: one MK getting first at CSB
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: in jacek's case it's the Infinite Pony Theorem
 jacek: IPT eh
 Astrobytes: Sounds legit
 heavygabriel: it's called voodoo coding
 jacek: when will fim++ be on CG? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/FiM++">https://esolangs.org/wiki/FiM++</a>
 heavygabriel: it's what I do everytime I'm stuck
 eulerscheZahl: not before Vala
 heavygabriel: c
 heavygabriel: c--
 heavygabriel: decrements c
 eulerscheZahl: can you install it on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ponyos.org/">https://www.ponyos.org/</a>&#160;?
 heavygabriel: c++? no
 heavygabriel: c-- ye
 Astrobytes: Dear god
 eulerscheZahl: wow, it's version 6 already, still actively developed
 eulerscheZahl: the first time i heard about it was version 4. even installed it in a VM because i was curious
 heavygabriel: is it lightweight?
 Astrobytes: "What are people saying about PonyOS?" is great
 heavygabriel: but can it run on arm64?
 eulerscheZahl: "PonyOS works on many different machines"just try it
 dbdr: is PonyOS wrintten in Pony?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ponylang.io/">https://www.ponylang.io/</a>
 struct: Why does CG have D but not Pony?
 Harphazi: hello
 Astrobytes: Or FiM as jacek pointed out
 dbdr: probably more (fake) demand
 dbdr: but Pony looks more interesting
 Harphazi: hello guys,  I have a question please. which best langage for games
 Hjax: depends on the game, and what youre good at 
 Hjax: python is really approachable and fine for some games
 Hjax: but if you need more performance, something like C++ is better 
 struct: *rust
 dbdr: *pony
 Uljahn: *D
 Astrobytes: VB 4.0
 dbdr: :door:
 Wendys: i suck at clash of code
 Hjax: if you need more performance but arent masochistic enough to use C++
 Hjax: i recommend Rust 
 Harphazi: thank you guys im appreciate
 TheSpiffiest: I'm falling in love with Rust, but every so often I just go do something in Python because I need it done in 5 minutes&#160;:)
 dbdr: by the way, well done on finishing your Rust bot Hijax!
 Harphazi: :thumbsup:
 Hjax: thanks dbdr :D 
 Hjax: ended up with a nice performance bump 
 struct: Now use AVX
 struct: for even more
 dbdr: I agree TheSpiffiest,  , I also like python for such short scripts
 Harphazi: what is your opinion about GoDot engine
 Astrobytes: It was nice when I could test against Hjax in the IDE... :P
 Hjax: :D
 Astrobytes: Harphazi, I have a friend who uses it a lot (Godot), it's pretty solid afaik
 Hjax: its kind of silly that ide runs bots in debug mode when you are challenging bots that arent yours 
 eulerscheZahl: too bad that #if DEBUG doesn't work anymore for C#&#160;:(
 Hjax: if it makes you feel any better, i cant test against anyone 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Harphazi: thanks
 Astrobytes: It's quite an annoying situation really
 Astrobytes: But hey, not the end of the world
 Hjax: i need to set up my self play stuff
 eulerscheZahl: which CG planned to address right after the last contest
 struct: Hjax you can do what dbdr does
 Hjax: what does he do
 eulerscheZahl: release more compilation everywhere, even in the IDE
 Astrobytes: Send a binary?
 struct: Yeah
 Astrobytes: mode euler?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 Hjax: you said more instead of mode
 Astrobytes: "release more compilation everywhere"
 Astrobytes: RELEASE MOAR COMPILATIONS
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just paraphrasing a discord discussion how CG plans to tackle the issue
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: mode
 Hjax: :D
 Astrobytes: Compilations, asa far as the eye can see
 jacek: discord? see, another mlp reference
 Astrobytes: *as far
 Hjax: how do i send a binary for rust? 
 Astrobytes: Mail it to France first
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: I dont know Hjax
 struct: I guess you could ask dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: place it in the rain for a year
 TheSpiffiest: Lol - Clash of Code - every player got 0%
 TheSpiffiest: first time I've seen that
 eulerscheZahl: faster if you add salt
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 dbdr: Hijax: there is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary">https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary</a>
 dbdr: as-is or for inspiration
 eulerscheZahl: with unicode for larger binaries
 Hjax: rust in debug mode seems to be about as fast as python
 Hjax: release mode is 70x faster roughly 
 dbdr: 70x between debug and release, wow
 Hjax: well i get 7k rollouts turn 1 in ide, and 500k on submit 
 dbdr: I saw 40x for one algo, and I thought that was a worst case situation
 dbdr: hm, it might not be perfectly linear
 dbdr: each time you go deeper, rollouts are shorter
 dbdr: though you need time to go through the tree, but so it's different, one way or another
 Hjax: im using EPT
 Hjax: all of my rollouts are the same size 
 dbdr: oh true
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: probably depends a lot on the structure of the code as well
 Hjax: as someone completely new to rust, i make no claims about my code quality 
 Hjax: it compiles and the borrow checker doesnt blow up, so im happy 
 dbdr: e.g. if you have many small functions (one instruction), not inlining in debug mode will be more expensive
 dbdr: it's not even about quality
 dbdr: it's just that the speed factor depends on many things
 Hjax: oh i have one really small function 
 Hjax: its just a unsafe _pdep_u64 block, used in my move gen 
 dbdr: don't worry about it
 dbdr: wow, that's cool!
 Hjax: i get a lot of speedup out of being able to use BMI2 i think 
 Hjax: just because of pdep
 dbdr: popcount too?
 Hjax: ah true, also popcount
 Astrobytes: pdep for actual move gen or just to pick one from the generated moves?
 Hjax: the latter, but its kind of part of move gen 
 Astrobytes: yeah cool, just clarifying&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: I gotta learn them words
 Hjax: i considered trying to make my move gen faster, but i dont think i spent much time in it at all 
 Astrobytes: It's probably not a bottleneck
 dbdr: don't guess, measure&#160;;)
 Hjax: i dont early terminate if my state doesnt change, i still run all 7 iterations 
 Hjax: yeah i need to go set up my environment properly if i want to debug / benchmark rust 
 Hjax: havent done that yet 
 dbdr: by the way any C/C++ debugger/profiler should also be fine with rust
 Hjax: dont have one of those either 
 dbdr: right, just saying there are options&#160;:)
 tomatoes: clion debugger and valgrind as profiler works fine 
 tomatoes: on macos
 Hjax: i downloaded the clion trial, and it said i had to set up mingw or cygwin toolchains 
 Hjax: and i didnt bother yet 
 Hjax: my bot can win games from the IDE to be fair <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475894290">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475894290</a>
 dbdr: I think IntelliJ is the free version of Clion, essetially
 Hjax: yeah, but intellij doesnt have native debugging support 
 Astrobytes: yeah yeah yeah :P
 Hjax: unless you buy the ultimate version 
 Hjax: intellij is meant for java development 
 dbdr: originally
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://intellij-rust.github.io/">https://intellij-rust.github.io/</a>
 Astrobytes: (yeah yeah'ing at your IDE replay btw)
 Pierre-OlivierMorin: How do you import the whole thing to the ide?
 Hjax: "In CLion, you get even more: fully-fledged debugger, CPU profiler, and Valgrind memcheck. "
 dbdr: right
 eulerscheZahl: and Kotlin of course
 Pierre-OlivierMorin: lets say i want to code on visual studio 2019
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/31-editor-using.svg">https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/31-editor-using.svg</a>
 Hjax: that game is amusing Astrobytes, i give you all 4 corners and win somehow 
 struct: Visual studio for c++
 Astrobytes: Because my bot is shit currently Hjax :D
 struct: VSCode with wsl for rust should be nice right?
 eulerscheZahl: why is sublime more popular than atom?
 Hjax: i really dont like atom 
 dbdr: probably be nice since many peple use it, struct&#160;;)
 dbdr: I can only speak for vim
 RoboStac: eulerscheZahl - because lots of people hate  electron apps due to resource usage
 Hjax: vscode feels much snappier than atom, despite them both using electron 
 RoboStac: yeah, I prefer vscode 
 Hjax: i dont really know what atom did 
 Hjax: but it always just feels so sluggish to me 
 Hjax: major turn off
 RoboStac: struct - does #1 in wood 2 with an NN count as proving NN can work?
 Astrobytes: Oh crap, here comes robo&#160;:)
 Hjax: oh no 
 Hjax: go away robo 
 eulerscheZahl: hm, didn't think about that...tried sublime and it kept telling me that i should upgrade to the paid version, so i got annoyed
 eulerscheZahl: was still working, just the message
 Hjax: whats the boss at 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I ditched Sublime for vscode for that reason
 RoboStac: boss is 35.51 
 Hjax: wow it climbed back up 
 Hjax: i had it at like 33 when i promoted 
 RoboStac: sorry, 33.51
 Hjax: ah ok 
 Hjax: so you are about to promote 
 RoboStac: yeah
 Hjax: youve been working on a NN? :O
 Hjax: fancy, out of my league lol
 RoboStac: for the past hour or so, yeah&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: May the Lord have mercy on our bots
 Hjax: ... hour 
 Hjax: youre not human 
 Astrobytes: Same alphazero approach robo?
 RoboStac: I mean 99% of it was already written
 RoboStac: just had to swap the game rules out from breakthrough for othello
 RoboStac: and I stole them from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hanshq.net/othello.html#moves">https://www.hanshq.net/othello.html#moves</a>
 jacek: youre doing NN for breakthrough?
 dbdr: what about training time?
 RoboStac: well, it's still running. I just submitted as soon as I beat the boss
 jacek: mining othello coins eh
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: i think im about to lose a rank 
 Astrobytes: If the previous ones are anything to go by we're all about to be crushed. Will be fun to see it up against dbdr
 RoboStac: it's only really worked amazingly on oware
 RoboStac: breakthrough / yava didn't go too well
 Hjax: how long did it take you to develop initially 
 Astrobytes: That's still your best one huh?
 jacek: i still dont get whats 'policy'
 jacek: NN outputs are possible moves?
 dbdr: I need a reason to work on improvements&#160;;)
 Hjax: nn outputs are a probability for each square on the board 
 Hjax: at least in alphazero 
 Hjax: for policy 
 struct: oh no
 struct: I will lose 10€&#160;:(
 RoboStac: the policy in AZ is to guide the MCTS - its basically an explore factor for each move. Theres also a value for how good the current state is
 jacek: i mean more technically
 jacek: its NN with multiple output nodes?
 RoboStac: yeah
 Hjax: the output is the whole board
 RoboStac: 64 policy outputs and a single value output
 struct: Robo you have bugs though
 jacek: so 65 output nodes?
 RoboStac: (yes, I know I could filter the middle ones but I'm really lazy)
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475896605">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475896605</a>
 Hjax: youre using PUCT then RoboStac? 
 struct: you had 1 possible move
 RoboStac: the pass moves have been a real pain
 RoboStac: why can't people just lose instead&#160;:(
 jacek: that would be original reversi eh
 dbdr: hard to chose between 1 move
 struct: :D
 Hjax: im ready for the NN apocalypse 
 Hjax: yeah whenever you pass you timeout 
 dbdr: the nnapocalypse
 Hjax: end of an era, for any TCEC fans here
 Astrobytes: AZocalypse
 dbdr: Hijax, what happened with TCEC?
 Hjax: people joked a lot that it was the end of the (minimax) era 
 Hjax: when all of the alphazero style engines started showing up 
 struct: Stockfish still won&#160;:(
 struct: vs lc0
 Hjax: it did, several times 
 Hjax: it won a superfinal the other day 
 struct: yeah I only saw superfinal
 Astrobytes: Total beast
 struct: Then I saw stockfish vs komodo
 Hjax: that was a really good super final 
 struct: komodo won 3 games out of 100 
 Hjax: and fish won like, 30 or 40 lol 
 Astrobytes: oof
 Astrobytes: Oh robo working his way up Wood 1
 Hjax: 2-2 against me so far 
 inoryy: great job, RoboStac
 Hjax: inoryy can smell new neural networks 
 inoryy: lol
 Hjax: and comes to offer congrats 
 Astrobytes: :smile:
 inoryy: NN sense is tingling
 jacek: so youre always losing when pass move happens eh
 struct: not always
 jacek: :scream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475897986">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475897986</a>
 Hjax: i was just watching that game 
 Hjax: how long until its done training RoboStac?
 Hjax: when will the network be saturated 
 Hjax: oh boy a new submit 
 RoboStac: hopefully will fix passes crashing 
 Hjax: how long does the network take to train
 Hjax: when will we see the full strength monster network 
 RoboStac: no idea, its more of a wait and see kind of thing
 struct: Does it only self train?
 RoboStac: oware is pretty much done after an hour, but yavalath takes longer
 RoboStac: yes
 Hjax: you got another pass crash 
 Hjax: against Astrobyte s
 Astrobytes: Yasss a win
 Astrobytes: :P
 Hjax: pass crash against me, but i was in a won position 
 RoboStac: ah yes, checking if the enemy made more than 2 moves won't detect single passes 
 Hjax: teapot has 100% winrate against RoboSta c
 Hjax: all hail teapot
 eulerscheZahl: and teapot == boss.how did robo even promote?
 Astrobytes: No, current teapot is not boss
 Astrobytes: That was Old Teapot
 dbdr: old teapot make better tea
 dbdr: *teapots
 Astrobytes: 'tis true

 Hjax: era not ended yet 
 LelouchVC2: Matrix has been destroyed
 darkhorse64: the teapot is a kind of cerberus (two heads only), top of Wood2 and bottom of wood1. No one has been able to to take his place 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: theres only two bots robo hasnt defeated yet 
 Hjax: teapot and dbd r
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: epic
 dbdr: TIL there's a middle finger emote in the CG forum, and its code is :fu: :D
 eulerscheZahl: 🖕
 Hjax: ✌️
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl abusing unicode&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and it doesn't even look like the middle finger if you don't know it
 dbdr: btw I saw you retook global #1 today
 eulerscheZahl: could be a thumb with a rotated hand too
 dbdr: with +500 CP
 eulerscheZahl: my bandas was crashing
 dbdr: any submit, or just fluctuations?
 dbdr: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: allocated 3e7 nodes
 eulerscheZahl: language update broke it, so i reduced the number
 eulerscheZahl: no idea why. less efficient memory handling on .net Core? :thinking:

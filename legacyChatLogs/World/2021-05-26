 ggenilson: morning guys!
 ggenilson: how can I battle with a single person?
 KiwiTae: ggenilson you go to them and ask them if they want to battle with you, if yes start punching each other
 aCat: ggenilson in multiplayer game ide you can substitute boss with any other person with the same / lower league 
 aCat: there are some remove / add buttons

 sprkrd: advancing leagues in coders strike back is hell. I'm clearly better than the bronze boss, but there are so many people that climbing in the leader board seems almost impossible. And I'd rather have the full set of rules before investing serious time with it &gt;:(
 Sitja: if you clearly beat the boss you would be first in the leaderboard, you don't have to wait it is pretty fast to ramp up like in one minute you can know
 Morcifer: @sprkrd, isn't it just a matter of time even if a lot of people are climbing in that league? I typically found that if I'm better than the boss, by the next day I'd have advanced to the next league.
 Morcifer: And since getting to bronze is relatively easy, and rules stop changing at bronze, I never had that problem...
 sprkrd: In CSB you don't get the final set of rules until silver
 sprkrd: the tutorial reaches up to bronze league
 sprkrd: @Sitja: I do think I beat the bot most of the time, unless I'm extremely lucky on the IDE and extremely unlucky in the arena. But yeah, I'll stop crying, have some patience and/or try to find the laziest way to beat people in the middle of the ranking (already got a suggestion)
 Morcifer: Oh, crap, good to know!!
 sprkrd: That would be a solution, but I'd rather pull my own weight. Pride is my sin :D
 sprkrd: I was just crying to vent, I'll eventually get around it&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: what we talking about
 KalamariKing: csb I take it?
 sprkrd: yep
 sprkrd: I saw some talk yesterday on the chat about CSB that caught my attention. Never participated in CSB before
 KalamariKing: about what? using nns?
 KalamariKing: we were talking abt nns a lot yesterday, with ttt
 sprkrd: Actually, the conversation was about GAs
 KalamariKing: yesterday?
 sprkrd: Maybe it was the day before yesterday
 sprkrd: But I think it was yesterday. You from US, right? Maybe you weren't awake :D
 KalamariKing: must have evolved since me A​ntiSquid and MS​mits were talking
 KalamariKing: Yeah probably not lol
 sprkrd: AntiSquid wasn't there, it was astrobytes
 KalamariKing: ok yeah different conversation
 KalamariKing: must have evolved to gas
 AntiSquid: what do you need?
 KalamariKing: oh hi, didn't mean to ping, sorryWe were discussing yesterday's conversations
 KalamariKing: Shortly after i left, it went to ga's, right
 sprkrd: Yeah, sorry, didn't mean to ping either
 KalamariKing: Anti I didn't ping you right? the zero-width space worked?
 sprkrd: He went to his slumber again :joy:
 sprkrd: Like an ancient dragon summoned on accident

 Jeff_93: Hi Guys! How can I set a specific seed in editor mode?
 Uljahn: in browser IDE? set mode to "Expert" in settings, thenuse "manual" tab  in options
 Uljahn: *then use
 ErrorCookie: What medium puzzles can you recommend?
 Uljahn: any classic ones
 Uljahn: those with no author specified
 ErrorCookie: ok thonks .(^_^).
 Jeff_93: Thanks a lot, uljahn!
 Uljahn: yw
 _FloPvP_: hi
 Shizznett: helo
 MitchPlease: Hrm, Im stuck on the second test case for the temperatures exercise
 MitchPlease: I have every other test case passing, but that one is messin with me
 Uljahn: you mean testcase 02 "Only negative numbers"?
 MitchPlease: yeah, I have everything else passing
 Fashathus: Just glanced at that, looks like that's the only case where the correct answer is a negative number. I'd check how you're handling negatives
 MitchPlease: but the conditoins I made to meet choosing the right temperature makes it hard for me to access those negative numbers
 MitchPlease: choosing the right temperature asks me to invert a negative to a positive
 wouter173: nigga
 MitchPlease: so, by doing that I make it hard to actually access the negative number in the array
 MitchPlease: its also in python so working in an array itself is kinda hard
 Uljahn: wut
 wotroe: @wouter173 pls no swear
 wotroe: this is a christian server
 stingalleman: @wpiter173 excuse me?
 wouter173: oke
 wouter173: en wie
 wouter173: wie 
 wouter173: wie vroeg
 wotroe: i dont speak german
 jacek: oO
 Fashathus: trying to think of a tip I could give you that wouldn't just tell you exactly how to do it
 Fashathus: If you're not already I'd consider using abs() in python to help deal with negatives
 RogelioMENDOZA: Though be careful with the case abs(t) = abs(current_closest_to_zero)
 Fashathus: also instead of overwriting your negative values you could make a copy of the array of values in it and doing comparisons with that 
 Fashathus: or values in it*
 MitchPlease: hmm, maybe I loop through the array and place negative values into another array?
 Fashathus: that could work, just be careful you handle the -5 vs 5 case correctly then
 Uljahn: MitchPlease: or you could just track min and max bounds while looping through
 MitchPlease: gah im so close LOL
 Fashathus: That works too, I was trying to help without just telling you exactly what to do lol
 MitchPlease: yeah lol, i appreciate that
 MitchPlease: the weird thing is
 MitchPlease: print(min(tempArray, key=lambda x:abs(x-goalTemp)))
 MitchPlease: when I use that min function and print it out both tests pass
 MitchPlease: but then the conditions for handling the rest of the numbers arent met
 Fashathus: What's goalTemp? isn't this always closest to 0 so the goal would always be 0?
 MitchPlease: Yeap, I just made it a variable at the start
 Fashathus: Not sure, I don't do a lot of python tbh
 MSmits: pycharm is funny. I am trying to convert my TTT NN to use keras
 MSmits: pycharm is making some "suggestions"
 MSmits: Typo in word "winrate"
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: Suggestion, replace with "ingrate"
 MSmits: not kidding
 MSmits: it's also suggesting to replace tanh with tan
 MSmits: (as an activation function...)
 reCurse: Is it suggesting to replace keras with pytorch?
 MSmits: good one... no :P
 reCurse: Truly dysfunctional tool then
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: so truly oop tool then
 MSmits: still not completely clear why someone would prefer pytorch over tensorflow/keras or the other way around
 MSmits: I kinda went with the majority here
 reCurse: Without trolling my main reason is tensorflow has been a versioning nightmare the past few years, so no telling what it's gonna be in the next few
 reCurse: Meanwhile even quite old pytorch code works out of the box
 MSmits: sounds like a very good reason to me
 MSmits: well I am not too invested in either so if I end up not liking it, I can easily switch
 reCurse: Not too invested either but trolling is fun
 MSmits: ahh true
 jacek: why would mod say trolling is fun
 reCurse: I mean the good natured trolling
 jacek:  
 MSmits: if i look at the actual lines of code written for this TTT experiment the part that is Keras is very tiny. I
 MSmits: the TTT part is much larger
 relay: hy!
 MSmits: yo
 ErrorCookie: hello human
 MSmits: hi mammal
 reCurse: Did you just assume my species
 MSmits: nah he was talking to me I think. I shared my species before
 MSmits: noone knows what you are, so secretive
 reCurse: I don't know either for what it's worth
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: literally the only hard part to converting my code to keras is figuring out how to format the input array
 MSmits: i had a python list of lists 
 reCurse: Tensors typically go from last dimension to first in ordering
 MSmits: ah I see
 reCurse: Assuming it's contiguous
 reCurse: I'm also assuming tf follows the same principles
 reCurse: Only fluent in pytorch
 RoboStac: if you are trying to pass a single state in you'll probably need to put it in a list too as it expects batches
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f96c3b9d-5b6c-4e0d-929a-4d313504a3a9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f96c3b9d-5b6c-4e0d-929a-4d313504a3a9</a>
 MSmits: no, i am not putting a single state in
 relay: Can you help me in my career? xd:relieved:
 MSmits: the xor example had input_dim = 2
 MSmits: so i figured i just put 27
 KiwiTae: relay here's help o/
 relay: thx
 MSmits: X = np.array([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]])y = np.array([[0],[1],[1],[0]])
 ErrorCookie: KiwiTae your bird looks tasty
 MSmits: I just need to make it a np array i am guessing
 MSmits: prolly doesnt understand list of lists&#160;:)
 reCurse: Sorry this is too specific to keras for me
 MSmits: yeah it probably is
 relay: o/ i don't understand how i have to prepare coding on this site...(((
 reCurse: Alright BT fixed, what's next...
 jacek: isnt pytorch == keras, or what am i missing here
 KalamariKing: wdym
 reCurse: No it's not at all
 KalamariKing: pytorch and keras are different
 reCurse: Keras used to be an abstraction over different ML libraries
 reCurse: Now tensorflow took ownership of keras
 MSmits: theano too
 reCurse: So who knows if that's still really true
 relay:  i don't understand how i have to prepare coding on this site...(((/o
 KalamariKing: I think *correct me if I'm wrong* keras is higher-level to make pytorch (but mostly tensorflow) easier
 MSmits: yeah it's built on top, they say "tensorflow back end"
 reCurse: I'd rather work with the library directly than try to figure out what it's actually doing behind the scene when it inevitably messes up
 reCurse: But I guess tf == keras now so
 reCurse: shrug
 reCurse: Maybe a symptom of google overengineering or maybe a symptom I'm just a monkey
 struct: re curse is your stc NN?
 reCurse: No it's oldschool
 struct: ok, thanks
 MSmits: this is probably just his contest code
 reCurse: Why
 struct: just wondering, it was submited around the time you started submiting NNs
 reCurse: Ah, no I was still too newbie for that back then
 reCurse: I could probably make it work now
 reCurse: But then I'd rather finish my puyo clone and make a bot for *that*
 jacek: youre doing contribution?
 reCurse: Was
 reCurse: I don't know what to do next tbh
 reCurse: I have zero interest to fix othello and checkers
 jacek: :soccer:
 jacek: fix oware
 struct: amazons, non bookable
 struct: ezpz
 StevensGino: can GA go into top 100 of CSB?
 reCurse: Yes
 jacek: oh i know, onitama!
 StevensGino: which algorithm you use on CSB @reCure&#160;?
 reCurse: Neural networks
 StevensGino: thanks
 reCurse: I am hesitating between chess, ooc and finish puyo clone
 reCurse: Not inspired by :soccer:, oware, amazons and onitama sorry
 jacek: if you start chess, will there be the end of this?
 reCurse: Well I'd just plug totozero, see what happens and hope that's it? :P
 jacek: so many ways to bitboard it
 reCurse: Though I might have to squeeze the NN a bit for 50ms
 jacek: im using 30ms
 jacek: for some reason over that it timeouts often
 jacek: could be not so granual search interruption
 reCurse: Ah right the random timeouts they won't fix
 reCurse: This is actually upsetting
 reCurse: Doesn't it just break most 50ms games?
 MSmits: not at all 
 jacek: works well on oware or onitama
 reCurse: Hm
 MSmits: I get maybe 1 in 100 timeouts using 45 ms
 reCurse: Ok then
 MSmits: but chess i dunno
 reCurse: Maybe it happens more in intensive periods
 MSmits: jacek maybe your bot runs into situations where it suddenly slurps 20 ms between checks
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: who made the chess. who approved it :unamused:
 reCurse: Oh right, how quickly I discarded the option of jacek's code being bugged
 reCurse: :P
 MegaGirl: Can you guys help me understand pseudocode? My instructor returned my assignment again and i don't know what he wants.
 reCurse: Not a school tutor sorry
 MegaGirl: That's okay. But do you have any recommendations on where I can go to understand it more?
 NotHenricDizzle: from what i understand pseudocode is supposed to represent code instead of actually being code
 NotHenricDizzle: like a blueprint almost
 NotHenricDizzle: "if balance is less than 100 print 'insufficent funds'" would be pseudocode
 NotHenricDizzle: because it's not an actual programming language
 MegaGirl: It doesn't have any syntax right?
 NotHenricDizzle: yeah
 Bendu: Sounds about right, yeah
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_2315470_J5vXC.jpg">https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_2315470_J5vXC.jpg</a>
 MegaGirl: Man, that's tricky cause you never really know what the instructor wants.
 Bendu: Yeah, especially since psuedocode isn't an actual language, so people may have different ideas of what to write for it
 Bendu: Or of what constitutes pseudocode
 MegaGirl: So does that mean there is really no WRONG way to write it?
 struct: if it works it works
 Bendu: That's my understanding, because it is meant to be a basic outline of your program
 sprkrd: there's definitely wrong ways of doing it
 Fashathus: A couple things you could do. If he has a TA reach out to them as they often do a lot of the grading and may know what they want. Just send him and email saying you aren't sure why he returned your assignments and ask how to fix it.
 Bendu: Yeah best advice is probably just to ask
 Fashathus: My experience with professors like that is they often explained what they want once in the middle of an unrelated lecture and now expect everyone to remember
 MegaGirl: Okay, well thank you all for the advice. No matter how hard it gets I will keep trying and not give up.:slight_smile:
 MSmits: wow it's hard to get keras to just do a single prediction and just get a number out of it
 MSmits: model.predict(np.array(arr))[0][0]
 MSmits: it expects a 2D tensor and outputs one
 MegaGirl: jacek, you are funny and just made my day:joy:
 eeeeeeerrrr: clash of cod
 eeeeeeerrrr: cod game

 Smelty: dhhhh
 BrunoFelthes: MSmits, you was offline yesterday, but I got legend using your tips at UTTT, thank you a lot.  
 jacek: :tada:
 BrunoFelthes: :heart_eyes:
 jacek: what did work eventually
 jrke: finally i coded a good tracker for opp in OOC
 jrke: good winrate
 jrke: just loosing due to timeout bug
 ZarthaxX: or your tracker being inefficient and timeouting too
 jrke: lemme track the timeout now
 jacek: you can track opponent but you cant track timeout?
 BrunoFelthes: jacek, was the question for me?
 jacek: yes
 BrunoFelthes: i changed the score to -1 to 1, with a constant equals 0, and the draw is not zero, it is less..
 jacek: exploration constsnt?
 BrunoFelthes: the UCT constant
 BrunoFelthes: yes
 jacek: so, no exploration? :scream:
 BrunoFelthes: equals 1
 BrunoFelthes: sorry
 BrunoFelthes:&#160;:)
 jacek: phew
 jacek: nice
 BrunoFelthes: but after the legend, i think that i found a bug, because, Almost every time, I have a clear win or lose with 3/4 rounds before the end, and my algo do not detect it... I need to build mcts solver, maybe it will be my algo better, I'm doing 20k rollouts at the starts plays...
 struct: 20k for java seems good
 BrunoFelthes: my tree ends with 3.5 to 4 billions nodes
 jacek: billions?
 struct: billions?
 sprkrd: really? doesn't add up
 BrunoFelthes: yes, billions
 struct: impossible
 struct: im sorry
 BrunoFelthes: why?
 struct: 1'000'000'000
 struct: right?
 sprkrd: 20k rollouts (upper bound, in the subsequent turns it will be less)*81 turns = ~2M nodes maximum
 BrunoFelthes: hum
 BrunoFelthes: no
 jacek: well near the end the 'rollouts' could be in millions if he isnt using solver. but that doesnt means billions of nodes though
 sprkrd: assuming a new node it'll be created in each rollout, which won't be the case either
 BrunoFelthes: let me check again
 sprkrd: yes, but towards the end new nodes are not created
 sprkrd: the same old ones are visited over and over
 struct: I create every time I do an action
 struct: and I get like 15 Mill nodes per turn
 BrunoFelthes: oh, you are right, it is million
 BrunoFelthes: do you create 15 million nodes in 1 turn?
 struct: yes but my mcts expands every action made
 struct: its bad
 jrke: bruno[weights] += millions - billions * lr
 BrunoFelthes: who to not do it struct?
 BrunoFelthes: how
 struct: well if you do normal rollout
 struct: it should be better
 struct: expand select one and do random moves until game is over
 BrunoFelthes: but every rollout, i need to expand one node, right?
 struct: I expand select expand select .. until end
 Wontonimo: Nice UTTT bot BrunoFelthes&#160;!
 BrunoFelthes: thankyou Wontonimo
 BrunoFelthes: hum, i see... Is it a kind of minimax?
 struct: no, its just poorly implemented mcts :D
 BrunoFelthes: hauhahua
 jacek: my 'rollout' count is somewhat lower, but they are smarter ~
 sprkrd: @struct actually, you're kinda doing tabular reinforcement learning :joy:
 sprkrd: With no persistence between games, of course
 jacek: no, hes doing expansion till the end
 sprkrd: yes
 sprkrd: which is why I said it's kinda like reinforcement learning
 sprkrd: there is no default policy, only the tree policy
 sprkrd: so it's updating for the whole state trajectory
 sprkrd: it's not temporal difference for sure
 sprkrd: because the target of the updates is the final result, there's no dynamic programming
 sprkrd: it's be like one of the algorithms in Chapter 5 of the RL book by Sutton and Barto
 struct: I think ill try uttt again
 struct: should not take much time
 jacek: hmm how many moves does typical backgammon game last?
 jacek: would it be feasible for CG?
 sprkrd: I think it should be totally feasible for CG :thinking:
 jacek: less than 300 plies?
 sprkrd: Not sure about the amount of moves though, but there was this algorithm called TD-gammon that nailed the game
 sprkrd: (neural network)
 struct: longest game was 143 shakes
 struct: w/e that means
 struct: i dont know if 1 shake = 1 play
 struct: ah wait it was just this person longest game
 struct: not overall
 sprkrd: it's a good upper bound then
 ddreams: well, if both players are trying to prolong the game....
 sprkrd: but then there can be a hard limit of, say, 200 turns
 ddreams: eventually it must end, but I think it's possible that it's extremely long
 jacek: it says 55 plies average <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity#Complexities_of_some_well-known_games">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity#Complexities_of_some_well-known_games</a>
 jacek: it could be reasonable to end in draw at 300 rounds
 jacek: or count the points(?)
 jacek: i dont know the game
 jacek: except for td-gammon thing
 sprkrd: branch factor of ~250
 jacek: due to dices i presume
 ddreams: Yeah, you have a score which is basically how many more steps you need to get all your pieces to the goal
 sprkrd: I think those are fine stats
 sprkrd: for a game
 sprkrd: poker would be a good one too
 sprkrd: and the top bot could earn some money in online casinos
 sprkrd: another source of income for CG
 sprkrd: poker outsourcing
 struct: I would say yes jacek
 ddreams: I don't think poker would be a good game here
 struct: but I never played the game
 struct: So I dont know the rules
 ddreams: Backgammon would fit the format quite well, since you only play a few games with each opponent
 ddreams: or just one
 sprkrd: @ddreams why not?
 Scarfield: you cannot draw in backgammon, first player to get all pieces off the board wins
 ddreams: it's too random, unless you play the same bots for a long time
 ddreams: and can exploit weaknesses in the other's
 UUolfo: that would go for all dice games then?
 ddreams: Backgammon is somewhat random, which is why you typically play several times
 ddreams: However, a better opponent beats you every time
 sprkrd: don't know enough about backgammon to judge that
 sprkrd: in fact, i know exactly nothing about bg
 ddreams: It's more interesting than it seems
 sprkrd: i've always wanted to learn what's it about
 Scarfield: its a really good game, there is a reason it has existed for so long&#160;:)
 sprkrd: but never found the time
 ddreams: another point in favor is that it's very easy to write a bot for it
 ddreams: but hard to write a superhuman bot
 ddreams: at least, it used to be
 Scarfield: yea, pretty simple rules, easy to learn hard to master type of game, the dice part is probably the worst for a CG port i guess
 jacek: td-gammon is superhuman and its from 90s
 MegaGirl: ( ' Hello World! );     :grin:
 ddreams: superhuman chess bots are from the 90's too
 Scarfield: so am i
 Scarfield: but im not superhuman&#160;:(
 ddreams: it's hard to be
 sprkrd: no need to be either
 ddreams: exactly, we can write programs that are
 sprkrd: better to create something that does the work for us :sunglasses:
 Scarfield: if there where a backgammon multi on CG I would definately make a bot for it though
 jacek: and got crushed by NN guys
 Scarfield: as per usual
 ddreams: ^ as is tradition
 sprkrd: i think there are new interesting trends in kaggle
 jacek: it would take a while tho, i havent done bot for game with random nodes
 sprkrd: some kind of differentiable decision tree
 sprkrd: xboost or something like that, i don't remember the name
 sprkrd: maybe that'll take the place of NNs some day :D
 sprkrd: all i know is a lot of people are using that like crazy
 struct: just reverse the seed jacek
 gon: like crazy
 struct: ezpz
 sprkrd: @gon did you just predict what I was going to say? :scream:
 sprkrd: You just typed that milliseconds after I pressed enter
 Scarfield: yea, the dice rolls should really not be somthing you could sim, then it would be another game basicly
 Scarfield: and by sim i mean predict
 sprkrd: reversing the seed of a prng is a whole endeavor on its own
 sprkrd: I think Java uses splitmix64
 sprkrd: not trivial to reverse at all
 jacek: i'd use secure random
 sprkrd: If you do it you just deserve to win
 struct: jacek even if you use random
 struct: its safe
 struct: seed is 64 bits now
 struct: used to be 32
 struct: thats why it was reversable
 jacek: i would not take chance with Random
 struct:&#160;:(
 sprkrd: but, even should you reverse it, you haven't quite won yet
 Scarfield: thats only twice the computation though :p /s
 sprkrd: you are able to predict future states, but you still have to predict the opponent's action
 CodeLoverboy: goooood afternoon!
 sprkrd: and come up with a better one, of course
 Scarfield: true, but one massice advantage it would be though
 sprkrd: yes, but i'd say if you reverse the seed you just deserve to win
 ddreams: yeah, even if you only knew your own throws it would be insane 
 AntiSquid: in breakthrough how do i know which color i am&#160;? do i need to check it myself?
 sprkrd: even with a simple generator like LCG you'd need to do quite some work, because you're not getting the generator's output directly, but only the past die throws
 Scarfield: its not in the input?
 AntiSquid: no
 Scarfield: then top or bot of board iirc
 AntiSquid: you just get moves in input
 struct: well
 struct: if its none you are first
 AntiSquid: oh ok
 AntiSquid: thanks
 AntiSquid: makes sense
 struct: np
 jacek: its None
 jacek: and i see reBless took his time to retrain his bot
 Scarfield: 0 losses
 jacek:&#160;:(
 sprkrd: BTW, on the same meta-level of reversing the seed, has anybody tried to win by completely breaking the game? For instance, in CSB the field is infinite. What happens if you towards the same direction at full throttle until the x coordinate or the y coordinate exceed the int boundaries?
 sprkrd: if you speed towards*
 ddreams: I guess you just lose
 ddreams: isn't there a boundary?
 sprkrd: I don't think there is
 ddreams: anyway, that's pretty far, and if you managed you'd perhaps overflow
 sprkrd: there's a view box with dimensions 16000x9000, but you can outside that box
 jacek: and int is 2 billions
 sprkrd: Yeah, I guess in this case what would happen is you teleport to the other side
 ddreams: or you'd make the referee fail, which doesn't mean a win for you
 sprkrd: but maybe there's something waiting to be broken out there
 ddreams: you should be a security researcher then
 ddreams: there's a lot of things to be broken out there
 sprkrd: sometimes I ponder that option
 sprkrd: but I chose a different career path :sweat_smile:
 sprkrd: no turning back now
 ddreams: what path did you choose?
 sprkrd: robotics
 AntiSquid: awesome choice
 ddreams: that's a more fun path imo
 sprkrd: sometimes it can be
 sprkrd: however, most of the time nothing works in robotics
 sprkrd: only for the demo videos
 ddreams: well, have you tried any security research? :p
 AntiSquid: you can fix it
 sprkrd: well, there's the middle ground
 sprkrd: security research for robotics
 ddreams: I've done robotics too, for repairing cracks in pipes under the water where it's too dangerous for human divers
 AntiSquid: robots will make you fix it&#160;?
 reCurse: The ultimate AI
 jacek: reCurse anything novel you done to bt?
 reCurse: No I just ported all the improvements and fixes, same as uttt
 sprkrd: maybe you already know this, but a lots of robots operate with ROS (a framework for sending and receiving messages). ROS has no security whatsoever, so doing a network scan you can discover a lot of robots in research labs that you can control as you wish
 AntiSquid: i know ROS
 jacek: IoT, the S is for Security
 AntiSquid: do you know Darpa subt challenge sprkrd&#160;?
 reCurse: Nice, I'll steal that one
 sprkrd: this is going to be fixed in ROS2, I think, by 2050 when people start adopting it :joy:
 AntiSquid: that's how i found out about ROS
 sprkrd: AntiSquid Yeah, I know about Darpa
 AntiSquid: did you try their contest then&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: did you win the millions&#160;?
 sprkrd: it's the one about racing in the desert, right?
 AntiSquid: no
 sprkrd: which one is it then?
 jacek: darpa? that military stuff?
 AntiSquid: you control 3 bots and they need to cooperate to find all orange stuff in a maze
 ddreams: did you guys see the formula 1 ai competition?
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.wevolver.com/article/the-indy-autonomous-challenge-simulation-race">https://www.wevolver.com/article/the-indy-autonomous-challenge-simulation-race</a>
 sprkrd: oh, yeah, I knew that one too, I got them mixed
 AntiSquid: last one was cave and the walls were pretty funny to deal with on top of the other difficulties
 sprkrd: no, haven't won millions yet :joy:
 sprkrd: a workmate suggested me once to participate on that
 AntiSquid: this year's the final
 sprkrd: never found the time because there's always a lot of papers and deadlines...
 AntiSquid: which one is the desert race&#160;??
 sprkrd: mmmh
 ddreams: "Award $1,000,000 USD to the first Team, $250,000 to the second Team, and $50,000 to the third Team to cross the finish line in 25 minutes or less"
 AntiSquid: i only know about dogfight and subt
 sprkrd: i think it was darpa too
 sprkrd: but from another year
 ddreams: in October they will race the cars live
 ddreams: 17th of June in a simulator
 AntiSquid: exciting, time to code some if-else on CG
 ddreams: Only universities are eligible though
 sprkrd: ah, then we're eligible :D
 AntiSquid: subterranean one was open to all 
 AntiSquid: is *
 AntiSquid: imagine that, you have to sign up for uni to do some contests ...
 sprkrd: Yeah, seems arbitrary
 sprkrd: I guess hey don't want Roufus and Doufus in the contest
 sprkrd: They only want TOP TIER NAMES
 ddreams: the best of the best is always found toiling away in some phd-program
 AntiSquid: guy and his garage winning a contest * sprkrd
 sprkrd: But do phd students have the time for contests? They have to write their thesis&#160;:)
 sprkrd: Like myself, I should write my thesis instead of procrastinating in CG :joy:
 ddreams: that'd probably be their thesis
 AntiSquid: prolly they do a mediocre/starter bot to have something to write about and then write it based on that&#160;?
 sprkrd: AntiSquid I've always advocated for that, for toppling the powerful :D
 sprkrd: Gonna go back to write my thesis. Introspection hurts
 ddreams: See you in five
 sprkrd: ha, you know it :D
 ddreams: Realism hurts
 AntiSquid: steal some ideas from contest postmortems lol
 sprkrd: AntiSquid Yeah, at least I try to make procrastination productive :D
 sprkrd: if i'm gonna waste time, better do it learning something
 reCurse: Then is it wasted time
 sprkrd: i was about to write just that
 sprkrd: you stole it :joy:
 AntiSquid: increase depth 
 ddreams: increase speed
 AntiSquid: to think further ahead
 jacek: so deep
 Andriamanitra: why am i getting 404 when i try to test this clash in IDE? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1462c7bd45e5d5bc2c375166880f72a4d2fe">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1462c7bd45e5d5bc2c375166880f72a4d2fe</a>
 Andriamanitra: we just had it and i wanna know why i only got 71% after passing all the tests 
 jacek: i dont know. could it be because its already approved you cant test it in approval page?
 Andriamanitra: i've definitely tested other contributions after they've been accepted.. although this one seems to be particularly old so maybe something's changed
 jacek: oh
 Andriamanitra: oh, apparently going into edit mode first lets me open the ide, nvm
 jacek: oO
 Andriamanitra: (the issue was that only the hidden validators check for alphabetic ordering in case of ties, if anyone was wondering)
 jacek: oh my
 WeiserTeufel: hello
 WeiserTeufel: just testing it
 UUolfo: Welcome
 ddreams: testing is important
 jacek: nah, push it to production right away
 jacek: on friday evening
 KOTS98: Sounds good to me!
 Astrobytes: Have I missed anything today?
 ZarthaxX: nope astromissed
 Astrobytes: Figures.
 ddreams: Me, probably?
 Astrobytes: Hi tho 
 ZarthaxX: what is the lastr achievement for optim quest map?
 ZarthaxX: top 2% code golf?
 ZarthaxX: please say no
 Astrobytes: No.But that answer is false.
 ZarthaxX: NOOOOOOOOOO
 ZarthaxX: why asrtro
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: You can do it. I dedicated most of a weekend to it.
 Astrobytes: I still won't do the clash path though.
 ZarthaxX: i dedicated HOURS a bit earlier just to get 200 chars in dont panic
 ZarthaxX: :I
 Astrobytes: Do it in multiple languages.
 ZarthaxX: that's even worst...
 ZarthaxX: you are not funny
 ZarthaxX: wait tho, you get ranked with same lang&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: I can't remember what counts tbh
 ZarthaxX: i wanna die
 ZarthaxX: ty
 ZarthaxX: howdy btw
 Astrobytes: Search engines and language references + codegolf stackexchange + any CG threads on golfing might help
 Astrobytes: The process isn't fun but I guess there is a little bit of satisfaction at the end.Kinda like throwing up.
 ZarthaxX: yeah i get you
 ZarthaxX: i will do it for sure&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: will knock it out today or tomorrow
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Astrobytes: You got this easy, it's just tedious.
 ZarthaxX: sure
 ddreams: Why are you doing tedious stuff?
 ZarthaxX: i wanna finish and do multis lol
 ZarthaxX: the good part
 ZarthaxX: ddreams idk achievements :rofl:
 ddreams: I'm happy I don't care about those
 jacek: i just took the answers from normal puzzles and pasted into codegolf
 jacek: some of them were really shorter than my 'codegolfed' solution
 Astrobytes: I did it as it was less tedious than clashes. I don't care if the quest map is incomplete, I just won't do clashes
 ZarthaxX: jacek for real¡?¡¡
 jacek: eeyup
 ZarthaxX: automate classhes :D
 ZarthaxX: clever jacek
 AntiSquid: wait so if optim goal is to get top 2% then the goal post keeps moving for new peeps
 ZarthaxX: would have saved me from severe headaches
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid right
 ZarthaxX: it's like, painful
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: good point
 AntiSquid: why didn't they do something like that for multis to increase activity?
 Astrobytes: 5% issue
 AntiSquid: optim has even fewer people
 Astrobytes: Anyway, ignore that. I'm losing salt.
 AntiSquid: eat bananas, drink coconut water
 Astrobytes: No, I mean my CG sodium levels are being deliberately reduced.
 AntiSquid: joking :D
 Astrobytes: I know!
 Astrobytes: Also, coconut water out of anything other than an actual coconut is atrocious,
 Astrobytes: *.
 Astrobytes: Bananas are ok when they're a little underripe
 AntiSquid: thought it's alright (coco water)
 ZarthaxX: wdym by 5% issue?
 AntiSquid: check my school ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: Someone else link the discussion please. I am reforming myself.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/466965651135922208/798943788516900864">https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/466965651135922208/798943788516900864</a>
 Astrobytes: I also looked it up, in case I was wrong. Y'know, trust but verify :P
 ZarthaxX: i dont get it
 UUolfo: @Astrobytes Banana water?
 Astrobytes: Read that discussion ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes what discussion
 ZarthaxX: ohhh
 ZarthaxX: that link lol
 Astrobytes: The discord link squiddy posted
 ZarthaxX: thought i had to check squido school there lol
 AntiSquid: one day people will stop calling me a squid&#160;:'(
 ZarthaxX: what's up with your school
 Astrobytes: UUolfo: that can take a long walk off a short plank that's for sure :D
 AntiSquid: it's a reference to that 
 Astrobytes: *notasquiddy
 Astrobytes: just 'anti' is too vague
 ZarthaxX: oh i see why the 5%
 ZarthaxX: competitors are 5% of platform?
 ZarthaxX: that's big anyway
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: but then competitors are the most active
 ZarthaxX: true
 Astrobytes: :zipper_mouth:
 AntiSquid: hey what do you think astro? bet there's something on your mind you'd like to share, isn't that right Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i don't know how to do anything with it
 Astrobytes: You cannot bait me into saltiness. 
 Astrobytes: I am strong. Like ox.
 AntiSquid: what if you see red&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I might confuse it with green, depending on the hue and contrasting surroundings.
 AntiSquid: anyways what are you up to astro&#160;?
 AntiSquid: on CG
 Astrobytes: Avoiding CG mostly.
 Astrobytes: When I come back I'll probably clean up on all the official multis that I never do because of board games.
 AntiSquid: cool, what do you do for fun&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Code things. Play guitar.
 ZarthaxX: drugs
 ZarthaxX: oh sorry
 Astrobytes: Hah!
 Astrobytes: Not these days sadly.
 ZarthaxX: i checked astro, there is a ranking per lang in code golf
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: what drugs to highlanders take&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Ah, there ya go
 Astrobytes: Haggaine
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm a Lowlander.
 ZarthaxX: why are you avoiding cg astro
 ZarthaxX: :c
 ZarthaxX: life doesnt exist beyond cg
 Astrobytes: Reducing my salt intake and output
 AntiSquid: lol right, ZarthaxX you were MIA most of the time
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: that's why i was saying it mostly
 AntiSquid: sneaky baer
 ZarthaxX: being hypocrite :D
 ZarthaxX: i have been always here tho, just dont talk nor do
 AntiSquid: where are the good old trolly times gone&#160;?
 ButterM-40: UwU
 ButterM-40: what this
 ZarthaxX: ah, lol
 ZarthaxX: those were times
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX has achieved omnipresence
 ZarthaxX: trolling ppl nonstop
 ZarthaxX: i have become a better bear no,w hopefully
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: is LelouchV2 or something reminds me of you but his jokes are mild by comparison
 AntiSquid: that*
 ZarthaxX: wot
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes OmniaxX
 ZarthaxX: mhmm ,that could been a good name
 ZarthaxX: maybe for alt
 Astrobytes: I like it!
 Astrobytes: ZarthomniaxX!
 ZarthaxX: oh that's nice
 ZarthaxX: but sneaky
 Astrobytes: It's similar to 'insomniacs', syllabically at least
 ZarthaxX: i need a sneaky one, that one almost reveals my name :P
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: i have an alt, will change name later lol
 AntiSquid: did it get kicked at all from chat&#160;? your alt&#160;?
 Astrobytes: AxXiomN
 AntiSquid: i need to submit an application not sure what to write @_@
 Astrobytes: Your name is usually a good start.
 AntiSquid: the cover letter stuff
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid no, why? :P
 Astrobytes: Their name
 ZarthaxX: what are you applying for????
 AntiSquid: usually i paste a default long winded cover, thought i should make it shorter, there's no way anyone ever read that
 AntiSquid: just another job within my little world 
 Astrobytes: Shorter is better. Make them want to look at your CV.
 AntiSquid: diff team same department
 ZarthaxX: ah okwey
 ZarthaxX: gl tho&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: true
 AntiSquid: thanks baer
 ZarthaxX: i have a friend that feels his cv with boilerplate
 ZarthaxX: fills*
 Astrobytes: Explain why you're right for the position and why you want it.
 Astrobytes: Simple as that. It's "PICK ME PICK ME PICK ME YEAH!"
 ZarthaxX: *dont you dare reject me*
 ddreams: I know where you work
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: oh noes
 ZarthaxX: that's a good one for this situation
 MUlRA: how do you use stderr to print debug message in console? 
 ZarthaxX: lang?
 MUlRA: C#
 Astrobytes: "Hello. I sleep with your boss. Thanks for the job."
 AntiSquid: it shows you in the default code any language
 MUlRA:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: question mark
 Astrobytes: it's in the commented part of the default code
 MUlRA: found it, thanks!
 Astrobytes: Plus caps
 Astrobytes: Anyway. See ya's tomorrow or something.

 ZarthaxX: nope
 ZarthaxX: hi Exodomaximus
 BrunoFelthes: I'm trying to implement the MCTS Solver at the UTTT, but i dont know how to deal with the draw... Anyone has any reference?
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth give a &amp; to BrunoFelthes.</b></p><p><img src="/a/3876179544657" /> sprkrd: I just treat draws as a result of 0, loses as -1, and wins as +1
 sprkrd: when I used MCTS, that is. My current bot uses negamax
 struct: solver is quite different though
 sprkrd: what do you mean?
 struct: MSmits explained it to me before but I cant remember
 struct: mcts is different from mcts solver
 sprkrd: Is "MCTS solver" a different concept from "MCTS"?
 sprkrd: Oh, didn't know that
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup, it's some variant...
 sprkrd: yeah, looking at a paper describing it now
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 sprkrd: yeah, it was that paper in fact
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 AntiSquid: 1001 MCTS paper nights
 sprkrd: :D
 sprkrd: interesting stuff this MCTS solver stuff
 sprkrd: Maybe I'll give another chance to my MCTS bot some day and adapt it to use this approach
 sprkrd: I see the problem with the draws
 sprkrd: One non-ideal solution would be to treat draws as loses if you're the first player and as wins if you're the second (because it'd seem that it's easier to win as the first player, and the second player should be happy enough with a draw)
 KyleWardle: How is the percentage score in clash of code work?
 Smelty: e?
 Smelty: its the amount of validators that you pass
 Smelty: ex. if you passed 3/4 of validators you get 75%
 KyleWardle: I passed all and it gave me 33%
 KyleWardle: at least i passed all the tests given?
 KyleWardle: if thats what you mean by validators
 BlaiseEbuth: Nein
 YurkovAS: BrunoFelthes parent is draw when: all child is solved, hasn't wins and has 1+ draws
 BlaiseEbuth: Validators are different from the tests in the IDE.
 Smelty: KyleWardle the test are different from validators to prevent hardcoding
 Smelty: ....what blaise said
 KyleWardle: so it was a reverse one so im not sure what the end goal was but i passed all unit tests, should i rate the test relevancy as poor then?
 KyleWardle: Nobody in the full clash got 100%
 KyleWardle: most was 50%
 Smelty: ...sure
 BrunoFelthes: Nice YurkovAS, i will try it
 Smelty: if you hardcoded it, though, then don't rate it as bad
 KyleWardle: I didnt hardcode it
 Smelty: because the validators are there to prevent hardcoding
 Smelty: okay, then go ahead
 MSmits: anyone still have questions about mcts solver?
 MSmits: i got pinged
 Aftaklas: print(<i>.join(chr(ord(c)^(0x20*c.isalpha()))for c in "fE g!eF"))</i>
 Aftaklas: how does for loop work?
 MSmits: c is an item in the collection that's a string
 MSmits: a string consists of characters 
 MSmits: so each "c" is a character
 MSmits: so first it does f, then E, etc.
 Aftaklas: y but how does it work when c is called before the loop
 MSmits: it's not called before the loop
 MSmits: this is a way of writing that comes from functional programming i guess. Python does this sort of thing
 MSmits: it applies whats before the loop to every item in the loop
 MSmits: print(c) for c in string
 MSmits: would print every character in the string
 MSmits: unless i did a syntax error somewhere in there. I dont use this way of coding
 Aftaklas: ok ty :P
 struct: msmits you still use the sse instruction on uttt to check for win?
 MSmits: mmh i dont know. Let me check
 Notter: Should I define custom exceptions for my bot?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d859ef5-4a63-4a4d-b573-8ca7be1a7103">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d859ef5-4a63-4a4d-b573-8ca7be1a7103</a>
 MSmits: still in there I guess
 MSmits: not sure what you mean Notter
 Notter: Uhhh
 Notter: Like an error if I try to do something that's not allowed
 Notter: By the game rules
 struct: ah good
 struct: its fine, I was trying and found some old snippet from you
 struct: that was a little bit slower
 struct: But that one is fine
 MSmits: ahh ok, i think this is one you improved :P
 MSmits: Notter I use debug print statements
 MSmits: use whatever works I guess&#160;:)
 struct: I use return _mm_movemask_epi8(result);
 struct: It works
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: I converted my TTT NN for use with TF/Keras today
 struct: nice, did it work?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: training got really fast
 MSmits: but doing a single prediction got slow :P
 MSmits: it's because it converts numpy array to a tensor before doing the prediction
 MSmits: at least I think thats why
 MSmits: it's over 10x slower than my handcoded network at prediction
 struct: Still the training should make up for it
 MSmits: yeah it does
 MSmits: it's only annoying when I try to benchmark 1000 TTT games and it has to do like 30k predictions 
 MSmits: i mean once i work with a c++ inferer this doesnt matter anymore
 struct: will you use gpu or cpu?
 MSmits: i'm just using cpu for practice now, but I guess I'll install some tf gpu packages and such when i need to
 MSmits: my gpu is suitable at least
 struct: ah right you will only code the inferer on c++
 MSmits: yeah i will try to use keras locally
 MSmits: to train
 struct: which gpu do you have?
 MSmits: 1060 GTX
 MSmits: not the newest but tf said it works
 struct: it works yeah
 MSmits: I changed my random opponent to also pick winning moves when they are available to be on the same level with nn
 struct: Im just going to try to improve UTTT before going back to the book
 struct: I got a bit lost
 struct: on the book
 MSmits: book?
 MSmits: you're writing a book?
 struct: No
 struct: The NN book you are readin
 struct: I also bought it
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: I stopped at page 200, will probably get back to it
 MSmits: the backpropagation is soooo dry
 struct: poorly explained?
 MSmits: no, i just think it's impossible to make that exciting :P
 struct: ah
 MSmits: but i get the idea
 MSmits: i just felt i had enough info to get started. 
 MSmits: as with any topic, when you get beyond a certain point, google can fill a lot of gaps
 MSmits: and Wontonimo as well :P
 MSmits: been talking a lot with him
 struct: I just need to take it slow
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw, as soon as you start trying stuff, just focus on the xor example
 MSmits: great place to start
 MSmits: mnist is good too i guess
 MSmits: but doing ai motivates me more
 MSmits: (ai for games)
 struct: mnist might be more exciting to start
 MSmits: mnist has a fashion set too if you like pants more than written numbers
 struct: oh had no idea
 struct: But I think ill stick with numbers :D
 MSmits: the book goes into the pants and shirt
 MSmits: guess it wanted to be original&#160;:)
 struct: it provides full explanation on it?
 MSmits: didnt not read that far ahead, but it has full code so i am guessing so
 struct: good
 MSmits: in fact, I think the book is so big because it keeps repeating the same code with new additions
 struct: I understand code better than words
 MSmits: the end of the book has 1 program that is like 20 pages long
 struct: that is true
 struct: lol
 MSmits: I think this the shirt's and pants program
 MSmits: is probably 1 page in keras :P
 struct: The final chapter is the pants and shirts?
 MSmits: I think so
 struct: I guess as long as I can code something with it after I read it, its fine
 MSmits: you can sure do that
 ZarthaxX: mhm
 ZarthaxX: i didnt get the top 2% optim achievement and im in 2%
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 ZarthaxX: ah nvm
 ZarthaxX: it was laggy

 struct: Only lost vs royale
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: this is a real book war now&#160;:)
 MSmits: hes got some of you booked too
 MSmits: maybe i should check out those royale games while i am at it
 MSmits: otherwise I'm going to be pushing him above you guys with these book war submits
 struct: The war is against old john right?
 jacek: yeah hes abive dbdr
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: i have no clue how good his bot it
 MSmits: is
 MSmits: because of the book
 MSmits: my bot is around trictrac's without book
 MSmits: i think i have 10-20% winrate vs dbdr
 MSmits: without it
 MSmits: but it's an unfair comparison, he has 300k parameters saved in his codesize :P
 MSmits: codesize is a resource you can use for various things. A NN will likely have a built in book somehow
 MSmits: so do ntuple bots etc, it's not explicit but hidden in the parameters

 jacek: oO
 MSmits: if the book war goes on long enough, me and oldjohn will draw every game
 MSmits: in that case, you guys can just copy our playline and draw against us
 MSmits: everyone will have the same rating&#160;:)
 MSmits: or maybe its like the rock paper scissors tournaments
 MSmits: if you want to have a 50% winrate, you copy the playline, if not, you win against others who do not
 dbdr: sounds fun :D
 MSmits: it's fun to me. I was hoping someone would join me to get to that point. Then I can work backwards along the tree and find a different branch. Othello is suspected to be solved as a draw, but maybe we can prove otherwise 
 MSmits: your bot almost plays perfectly already dbdr
 MSmits: it's like 1 mistake max per game
 MSmits: but it's hard to be sure of course
 dbdr: so I would just need a touch of randomness, right?
 MSmits: yeah, assuming you also use it in training
 MSmits: otherwise you might get some problems with overtraining
 MSmits: mind you, jacek has randomness and has a stronger bot than mine
 MSmits: but, i still beat him with a book
 MSmits: it just took a very long time
 dbdr: I don't know, sometimes the second best move is probably very close in value to the 1st
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: yeah, but they both may lead to a draw
 dbdr: so not a loss
 MSmits: sure yeah, i think there are many paths to draw
 MSmits: many paths without a mistake i mean

 jacek: remember at the beginning it eas the war me vs tric trac
 jacek: every day vast improvement over previous day
 MSmits: tric trac also has some random I think
 MSmits: took me a while
 jacek: if we kept this up, we would solve othello in 150ms
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 struct: I ported Othello for pieces, not war
 MSmits: my bot doesn solve that great. It never makes a mistake with less than 19 squares left
 struct: peace*
 MSmits: so my book never goes deeper than 41
 MSmits: when left alone, I think my bot plays an inferior move one out of 6 times or so
 MSmits: dbdr prolly 1 out of 20
 MSmits: maybe less even
 MSmits: sorry struct, old john started it :P
 MSmits: well the war, not the booking :P
 MSmits: tric trac started that actually, but he did it for like 3 plies
 MSmits: which seems pointless, most bots will do those moves right on their own
 MSmits: allright sermon done, i need to get some bread
 struct: I wonder if its worth to store depth &gt; 4
 struct: on STC
 MSmits: does the game not start randomly?
 struct: Well you can see the next 8 pieces
 struct: im not talking about books
 struct: Just trying every single move until depth N
 struct: Obviously I cant allways do depth 5, because its 22^5 states
 struct: But there are position where at depth 4 is under 20k states

 mzbear: euler is mean.  testcase 22 of space maze lol
 RoboStac: if thats the only one you are stuck on you can probably submit and get 100%
 Westicles: I never tried the non-validators.  How many moves is it?
 mzbear: well, i implemented BFS ... and every other testcase is super fast, but that one goes hundreds of thousands of steps in and then timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: space maze testcase 22: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516347734">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516347734</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and another solution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516347995">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516347995</a>
 RoboStac: it isn't very long, but there are a lot of valid moves - my search tests 94000 routes before finding that one and no other test case goes over 10k
 mzbear: i suppose i'll submit this to get a partial score ... oh, 100% ... hmph
 eulerscheZahl: congrats for solving it :tada:
 tomi08150: congratulations ^^
 eulerscheZahl: testcases are generatedbut i ran my own solver which might be a bit biased on difficultyand i discarded those testcases where mine struggled too much
 mzbear: i started on this 10 hours ago, and getting all other testcases solved took only a few hours
 Astrobytes: haha awesome, 8 people! Well done&#160;:)
 RoboStac: my original solution used to move the car around on the platform in order to get more time
 RoboStac: though I did manage to optimise it to work on turn 1 in the end
 mzbear: hahaha
 mzbear: that's hilarious
 Westicles: Doing them manually, validator 27 was by far the hardest
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516349691">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516349691</a>
 wlesavo: oh, skrill also got space maze, and the second solution is in python. probably hardcode, right?
 RoboStac: oh, that actually failed evn then
 mzbear: anyway, a naive breadth-first search goes totally nuts on 22 because there are opportunities to keep moving several pieces back and forth for no good reason
 mzbear: it's also possible that i have a bug in my code that only appears on that level
 eulerscheZahl: better that way then 100% testcases solved and 1 evil validator
 eulerscheZahl: than*
 RoboStac: yeah
 Westicles: No, skirll published... it is a real solution
 mzbear: i just typically don't submit until i have 100% done
 wlesavo: Westicles wow, nice
 mzbear: my code is a horrible mess compared to skril's c++ solution
 eulerscheZahl: python makes it even more impressive
 eulerscheZahl: good news for wlesavo, now you can try it too
 wlesavo: nah ill probably do a c++
 wlesavo: after raic though
 eulerscheZahl: of course after RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: space maze won't run away
 wlesavo: and ill hardcode python to check skril solution :smiley:
 Westicles: love the comments
 Westicles: # My C++ version run in some tens of ms, so I decided to give Python a try
 eulerscheZahl: sadly only very few users will get a chance to read it
 Maxim251: I read it&#160;:)
 reCurse: MSmits: "A NN will likely have a built in book somehow" That's a myth according to experience with lc0.
 Uljahn: could be kinda true for an overfitted NN
 reCurse: A net trained on endgames with less than 18 pieces still develops strong opening preferences
 reCurse: So it could not possibly have memorized or overfitted opening moves
 MSmits: what i mean is, you keep training it and training it and in games where it has a bad opening, it will have parameters adjusted so that the bad opening will disappear, that's all 
 darkhorse64: Not to say that MSmits is right but the goal of an opening is to seize a space advantage and limit opponent moves which is also true in middle and endgames
 reCurse: So how is that different from scoring heuristics that would make openings disappear? Would you call those as having a built in book?
 MSmits: all I meant was that if you use a meta mcts to find the best openings, the result is similar.
 happiegamer567: how do i find the coördinates on a game for the next checkpoint
 reCurse: Yeah but I'm taking specific issue with "book", if it's not a specific tree of hardcoded moves it hardly counts as a book.
 MSmits: there are differences and similarity. The similarity I was pointing to is the fact that a NN on CG specifically, uses codesize as a resource to play better
 happiegamer567:&#160;?
 reCurse: I'm just reminded of a debate surrounding whether leela has an implicit opening book and whether SF should be allowed one or not for fair comparison.
 VizGhar: happiegamer567 which game?
 MSmits: they should, imho
 MSmits: it's a clear advantage
 reCurse: Funny, I think they shouldn't
 reCurse: Probably why it's a debate :P
 MSmits: true
 happiegamer567: coders strike back im new here @VizGhar
 MSmits: personally I will concede that it's not really fair to target specific players with a book
 MSmits: but it *is* fair to create a generalized opening book to counter a NN
 reCurse: I don't see any such distinction
 reCurse: A book is a book
 reCurse: NN has no book embedded, just features that guide openings much like scoring heuristics would
 MSmits: true, but codingame has a small set of players. It is really not that hard to counter them all individually
 MSmits: that would never happen in a larger setting
 MSmits: NN's are more general
 MSmits: their benefits translate to a larger setting
 reCurse: If I train a NN on games vs those players, how is that different from countering them individually
 MSmits: but you dont do you?
 MSmits: you self train
 reCurse: Yeah but it's not because it's a NN
 reCurse: It's because of the training regiment
 MSmits: ah but you can overtrain with a NN, its dangerous
 reCurse: Is it
 MSmits: yeah if you overtrain vs me, you tend to become weaker against different players dont you?
 reCurse: If I overtrain against top 20 who happen to cover most bases, it's not necessarily bad
 reCurse: It's like that tic tac toe leaderboard
 reCurse: A bit like overtraining to rank high isn't it
 MSmits: mmh i think TTT is a bad example, books are quite poor there
 MSmits: othello is better
 reCurse: Did I say tic tac toe
 reCurse: My brain is still in bed
 reCurse: I meant rock paper scissors
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: yeah thats an interesting game
 MSmits: pattern recognition
 MSmits: perfect for NN's i guess?
 reCurse: If you have enough samples of leaderboard, maybe
 reCurse: But ranking high there is clearly from exploiting other knowns
 reCurse: So like overtraining I would say
 reCurse: So not necessarily bad
 MSmits: yeah, i should be careful to state whats fair and whats not. When it's not that clear what the game is
 MSmits: is it coming up with good heuristics yourself, letting a NN do it, or hardcode specific moves
 reCurse: So if the game is relatively well covered by top 20
 reCurse: It's possible overtraining against them isn't that bad either
 reCurse: Much like tweaking to batching
 MSmits: i guess so
 reCurse: There's nothing magical about NNs
 MSmits: i know
 reCurse: It's just an eval with more parameters
 MSmits: I do a class on NN tomorrow
 reCurse: Oh cool
 MSmits: as a teacher
 MSmits: using playground.tensorflow
 reCurse: High school students?
 MSmits: I build up the example slowly
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it has a lot of features you can turn on and off
 MSmits: i put a lot of different versions of it in iframes with lots of exercises
 reCurse: Is it just a class where you briefly expose things or an entire course
 MSmits: to try to classify the datasets that it gives you
 MSmits: it's 1-2 hrs, before this they did minimax, travelling salesman, bfs/dfs 
 reCurse: That's intense for high school, or maybe it's just the education here that sucked
 MSmits: there's no coding involved
 MSmits: they learn the algorithms
 MSmits: without the coding
 reCurse: Ok
 MSmits: so lots of unplugged exercises
 MSmits: this is what i like about playground.tensorflow, it really gives you an idea how NN's work
 MSmits: when you try to fit the spiral and *need* hidden layers
 MSmits: because the pattern is too complicated
 reCurse: Yeah
 MSmits: at the end they are only allowed to use the x and y inputs
 MSmits: and they need multiple hidden layers
 reCurse: Part of my brain clicked when I saw an example training a NN directly on a 2d image
 reCurse: It behaved exactly like compression
 reCurse: Well, exactly...
 reCurse: Scratch that word
 MSmits: similarly
 reCurse: You clearly have less parameters than pixels so it has to generalize
 reCurse: Thought it was another good perspective
 MSmits: this doesnt use filters does it?
 reCurse: No just x/y position and color as output
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: btw, i start with "isthisacat"
 MSmits: you probably know that
 MSmits: it's a nice data classification example to show students
 reCurse: I wonder if it came before or after hotdog or not
 MSmits: oh i should look at that too
 reCurse: You've watched silicon valley?
 MSmits: just a few episodes
 reCurse: First 4? seasons are great tv
 MSmits: i should watch it fully at some point
 MSmits: i guess you find a lot more recognition when watching it than i would
 reCurse: Possibly
 reCurse: Still has enough humor for those who don't
 reCurse: Just has more layers when you do
 MSmits: yeah it was nice
 reCurse: Then it started sucking after
 MSmits: it's like big bang theory when you're  a physicist
 MSmits: fun show but more so when you know the physics they use
 MSmits: and that is actually correct
 reCurse: I skipped on that show for a silly reason, much like many others
 reCurse: I can't stand laugh tracks
 MSmits: ah yeah, it's annoying when you pay attention to it. I tune it out mostly
 MSmits: hey I remember there being a page with lots of examples of AI abusing simulation errors
 reCurse: More specific?
 MSmits: and there's also one where a ship keeps going in circles collecting coins, never going to the finishline
 reCurse: Oh that's different
 MSmits: yeah but i think you know what i mean
 reCurse: It's reward shaping in reinforcement learning and how a bad one can lead to unintended behavior
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Well like a bad eval function
 MSmits: if you have the link, i will use it tomorrow
 reCurse: Sure
 reCurse: One sec

 struct: We cant check codes, because we were not on clash
 twitlydoof: alright I'll put it on pastebin
 eulerscheZahl: i see a way with squared runtime
 eulerscheZahl: a &amp; ~b &amp; ~c &amp; ~d~a &amp; b &amp; ~c &amp; ~d...

 eulerscheZahl: last validator has a trailing whitespace
 eulerscheZahl: your input parsing crashes on empty string
 eulerscheZahl: i consider that a bug in the clash but don't have moderation rights there
 SBtree-bit: I'm ready!!!
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53556efd919aee3f5685e1a21d86388044ec">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53556efd919aee3f5685e1a21d86388044ec</a>can anyone edit the last validator please?
 twitlydoof: alright thank you for explaining
 SBtree-bit: 2 more
 struct: Ok I edited it
 struct: Thanks for spotting it euler and twit
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even know you played that many clashes, thanks&#160;:)
 struct: I played on early days
 struct: I have over 3k
 jacek: oO
 mzbear: ... next up: given a list of bitfields, how to find a pair of bits that are set in exactly two of the bitfields.  my brain isn't working today at all :D
 mzbear: no, wait, i actually need something different
 mzbear: i have a feeling that if i could describe what i want, i would know how to get it.  lol
 jacek: rubber duck debugging to the rescue
 mzbear: i'm solving that tufoshiki solver and testcase 1-4 and 7-11 can be solved with extremely simple rules ... testcases 5 and 6 are more annoying.  i can reason out a logic in my head to solve these, but i can't describe it correctly, so i can't write it into code
 mzbear: of course, i could write a super simple search to give me the answers, but no way i'm resorting to that :D
 mzbear: i may have been slightly traumatized by Blocking
 jacek: youre blocking your memory
 Westicles: 1000 nails here all waiting to be hit with the same hammer
 eulerscheZahl: do i want to ask what that metaphor means?
 Westicles: well, if mzbear is easily bored using the same approach twice he is in trouble
 mzbear: even if hammers aren't made of gold, they can be too heavy to be wielded casually
 jacek: you want to do every puzzle of the week?
 AntiSquid: gold bends easily 
 mzbear: puzzle of the week has a time limit, so it's nicely constrained.  i like constrained things
 eulerscheZahl: paper soccer promo campaign jacek?
 jacek: it was puzzle of the week in the worst possible week&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: set yourself a time limit mzbear
 eulerscheZahl: contest week
 struct: Guess you will never play a multi ported by me
 eulerscheZahl: who?
 struct: mzbear if he keeps playing puzzle of the week
 mzbear: hmhm?
 darkhorse64: mzbear: play  yavalath. Please struct and try a very nice board game
 struct: It was a failed attempt at a joke, none of my ports made it to puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: yavalath by unknown
 mzbear: darkhorse: i'm worried that the tone for the words "very nice" aren't carried over the internet
 struct: Thanks darkhorse
 eulerscheZahl: i still wait for space maze, 2048, sokoban and minesweeper potw
 VizGhar: Why is everybody obsessed with "puzzle of the week"? Is there any benefit from solving it?
 jacek: i think yavalath was puzzle of the week?
 eulerscheZahl: just a massive player boost if your contribution gets chosen
 struct: no jacek
 Astrobytes: what euler said, other than that, no
 darkhorse64: There was no joke. I am serious. After UTTT, it's the multi I spent the most time with
 eulerscheZahl: you were gone for 4 months, how should you know?
 struct: notifications euler
 struct: I checked them when I loged in again
 eulerscheZahl: touche
 darkhorse64: You need to add a league to become potw
 Astrobytes: ohhhh
 mzbear: 114 players in the Yavalath arena ... and the top players have some scary names :D
 Astrobytes: yes ofc, that's how you get the achievement
 eulerscheZahl: yavalath has no leagues? that explains it
 struct: penguins has no leagues
 Astrobytes: scary names?
 eulerscheZahl: it has
 struct: I cant edit Yavalath 
 jacek: paper soccer has no leagues
 Astrobytes: Penguins does
 eulerscheZahl: pushing in higher league
 struct: oh it has
 struct: Just my followed list is all on first league
 struct: so I thought there was only 1 league
 darkhorse64: Not everyone with sufficient level can modify a community multi&#160;?
 struct: I think last time someone tried, it didnt work
 mzbear: astro: scary names as in people whose bots are likely to be much stronger than mine :D
 eulerscheZahl: i failed to edit langtons ant
 Astrobytes: It caaaan be done right? Langton's was fixed eventually iirc
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud did it
 Astrobytes: ah gotcha mzbear
 Astrobytes: then we petition him to add a league to yavalath
 Westicles: There is much glory to be had in seeking 2nd in 2048
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 can write the boss
 eulerscheZahl: petition him for community contest first please
 Astrobytes: still nothing?
 jacek: maybe its bad
 darkhorse64: Can we ask politely to thibaud to give yavalath back to struct&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I guess they're too busy with That Thing
 eulerscheZahl: he wanted to message me till yesterday
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: to let me know if a any kind of promotion is possible
 eulerscheZahl: they seem to be pretty settled on 2 contests per year
 Astrobytes: Meh. Well, unofficial it must be then&#160;:/
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: I am 5th in Yavalath. It'll leave not many people in the top league
 struct: I can write a bot
 struct: that maybe places in top 20?
 IfIHadATail: unofficial contests still get a pretty good turn out no
 IfIHadATail:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: was just a joke referencing your othello boss darkhorse64&#160;;)
 struct: ~30-20
 eulerscheZahl: nah, unofficial is boring
 IfIHadATail: but unoffical has always just been reruns of past ones though
 jacek: he could just use less time
 Astrobytes: not if you set the Hype Train in motion
 eulerscheZahl: just to the multiplayer arena where it gets burried
 struct: No, I dont want any strong bot
 struct: Not even with less time
 jacek: i think 3-ply bot that just avoid loses would be good filter
 darkhorse64: ^
 Astrobytes: sounds fair
 eulerscheZahl: ↑
 ArianPunk: Guys, when I solve a puzzle, I see a list other players' solutions. Is this list arbitrarily wrapped or are the solutions benchmark-ed?
 struct: ill just make 61 ply book
 eulerscheZahl: ArianPunk for the ordering?
 ToshiTuringMachine: ArianPunk they are sorted for upvotes 
 ArianPunk: yes
 ArianPunk: ohhh
 eulerscheZahl: community upvotes, then date of submit
 ArianPunk: Got it
 struct: Still should take me a while to do a bot for Yavalath
 struct: Still have some work to do on STC
 eulerscheZahl: planned completion: 2026
 struct: :D
 mzbear: ... only one testcase in futoshiki solver left unsolved...
 jacek: the suspence
 Maritto: today i run into 2 problems where i got 100% completion even tho the unit tests where giving only 70% completion.
 Maritto: *were
 Maritto: does this usually happen to anyone else&#160;?
 jacek: test cases and validation cases are not always the same
 jacek: so you dont hardcode solutions
 mzbear: sometimes validation tests are a bit easier.  sometimes they're a lot easier
 Maritto: in one of the cases the unit test inside of the clash was just bad. and the expected answer made no sense. 
 mzbear: ... and in case of futoshiki solver, it seems one validator test case is more difficult
 Maritto: oh, im into the 15 min problems
 Maritto: i checke d the futoshiki one but would take me longer than that
 Maritto: x
 Maritto: xD
 MSmits: struct if you need help with yavalath we'll help you. Top 20 possible for sure
 jacek: use MSmits bot as boss
 eulerscheZahl: without book and less sim time
 struct: Thanks
 MSmits: that would work i guess
 MSmits: do you want to go mcts or minimax for yavalath?
 MSmits: either works
 eulerscheZahl: nothing deterministic. would to easy to beat the boss that way
 MSmits: unless it's deterministically bad
 eulerscheZahl: minimax with a small random value in eval
 MSmits: i think minimax is easier
 struct: I might try minimax
 MSmits: plain mcts doesnt work
 MSmits: you need a heavy rollout 
 MSmits: it has some good ideas for eval
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: and boss isn't supposed to consume much CPU time
 jacek: i have rather plain MCTS, well aside for 1-ply win/loss check
 MSmits: like check all possible 4 in a row patterns
 MSmits: yeah win loss check works is the minimum
 MSmits: but i am sure you have more dont you?
 MSmits: oh, i do seem to remember you made a pretty extensive opening book here
 MSmits: that could offset having a relatively simple rollout
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: I check for traps as well
 jacek: yeah, anime taught me that too
 MSmits: missing that reference
 jacek: maybe its good
 MSmits: :confused:
 struct: I want to try top 10 on STC
 struct: So it might take a while
 struct: unitl i go for yavalath
 MSmits: i kinda want to try more breakthrough
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=japanese%20trap">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=japanese%20trap</a>
 MSmits: I like the game a lot. Sucks when you 're not good at a game you like&#160;:)
 MSmits: aha
 Astrobytes: :astonished:
 MSmits: that jacek, always teaching us things
 Astrobytes: +to avoid
 jacek: MSmits already avoid traps
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: not this kind of trap obviously
 MSmits: but I am forewarned
 MSmits: thanks
 jacek: another approach at yavalath, i have more experience this time. 2-ply minimax vs 10ms mcts bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/5tHh2mh.png">https://i.imgur.com/5tHh2mh.png</a>
 jacek: maybe jacekmax will be feasible this time
 MSmits: yavalath is a very different beast from most games though
 MSmits: it has an early and late game. you might need a completely different bot for either
 MSmits: there's always a point where it becomes impossible to force a trap anywhere because there isnt enough room left on the board
 MSmits: then you win if you managed to fill the board more efficiently
 MSmits: this happens around halfway through the game or so
 MSmits: mcts does a great job at filling efficiently, because the random rollout probes this feature well
 MSmits: minimax is better at finding early traps
 jacek: only few games get past 30 moves, let alone fill the board
 MSmits: but if an opening book makes sure you dont fall into any traps, the only games you can still lose are the longer games
 MSmits: so games I lose are usually long ones
 MSmits: but you're right in general, the trap thing prevents long games mostly
 MSmits: which is also why there are so few draws
 jacek: unless you prove game is a draw
 jacek: we're counting on you
 MSmits: I proved only 2 out of 9 starting hexes
 MSmits: out of the other 7, 2 are obviously bad for p1 and 5  are pretty balanced
 struct: you proven that 2 are win?
 MSmits: yeah center 7 squares, but thats 2 moves
 MSmits: center and the 6 around them that are symmetrically identical
 MSmits: swap rule prevents it though
 MSmits: you just give away the win
 struct: yeah, gomoku might be interesting too
 struct: with the swap2 rule
 MSmits: center square is wayyyy easier to prove btw
 MSmits: hex i mean
 MSmits: the other 6 take maybe between 100k and a million games depending on how good your solver is
 struct: damn
 struct: thats a lot of games
 MSmits: a few days if you havent done it before
 MSmits: i started over a few times
 MSmits: then i knew which moves to pick
 MSmits: can do it in an hour or two then
 MSmits: btw, if you're goal is just to solve these moves, you can also just minimax it
 MSmits: that will be much much faster
 MSmits: I think dafish can do it in an hour
 MSmits: but i did it inside of a meta mcts, which is not particularly efficient
 SBtree-bit: I AM SO HYPED FOR THE CLASH
 Astrobytes: Great.
 MSmits: I sense British sarcasm
 awnion: I sense British
 Astrobytes: Your sarc-y sense is tingling MSmits.
 MSmits: it is!
 jacek: i sense notEu member
 Astrobytes: Scottish is not British in my view. But that's my opinion.
 awnion: look closely 
 MSmits: but they may still have British sarcasm
 MSmits: I have German hair
 Astrobytes: It's just sarcasm tbh.
 Astrobytes: What accent does it have?
 MSmits: I guess so
 MSmits: it's mostly just not there
 MSmits: so i cant talk to it
 Astrobytes: In what way is your hair German though
 MSmits: mmh I always imagine them as bald
 Astrobytes: lol, what?
 MSmits: it's not accurate ofc
 MSmits: it's imagination
 jacek: euler hair?
 Astrobytes: Almost every German I've met has a full head of hair
 MSmits: mmh
 jacek: i thought you meant gray hair
 MSmits: which country is full of bald people then
 jacek: AutomatonNN whats german hair?
 AutomatonNN: who knows why my bot does not know what to do
 jacek: tibet?
 MSmits:  I have tibetan hair then
 Astrobytes: England? Well, not entirely I guess to be fair to them.
 MSmits: is it erosion? From the rain?
 Astrobytes: The beer and lack of brain cells.
 MSmits: ah
 Astrobytes: (that's just a joke before an Englishman jumps in)
 Astrobytes: Y'know, the fat bald, drunk English guy stereotype
 MSmits: so English self-deprecate but don't suffer insults?
 Astrobytes: The ones who won't suffer insults are incapable of self-deprecation
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: so you're saying not all English are the same, noted
 Astrobytes: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: so far so good. yellow uses symmetries in training <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/w5OYRoi.png">https://i.imgur.com/w5OYRoi.png</a>
 Astrobytes: Nah, English people are fine, I lived in England over half my life so they must've been doing something right
 MSmits: oh, this is a neural network then?
 jacek: n-tuple
 Astrobytes: for which game?
 jacek: Y
 MSmits: ahh
 Astrobytes: nice
 jacek: nearly 12x more posiitons
 Astrobytes: I guess n-tuples fits the bill for yavalath
 MSmits: yeah it does. I guess my minimax used them
 Astrobytes: surprised you didn't do it sooner jacek
 MSmits: I was 8th ranked with it
 Astrobytes: ah right, you had patterns encoded then
 MSmits: yeah all 4 in a row patterns
 jacek: i did, but apparently i need something more than TD learning
 jacek: as in, more plies than one ahead
 Guillermo.: how do you play a clash created by yourself?
 Astrobytes: that would figure for this game tbh, what with the traps and all
 jacek: you contributed clash?
 Astrobytes: Guillermo.: if you mean to choose it in a clash, you can't
 Guillermo.: So I made a private one and I cannot play it
 Guillermo.: I cannot host a private game with the one I made?
 jacek: huh
 Astrobytes: No, it's supposed to be random.
 Astrobytes: Sorry :shrug:
 jacek: well my n-tuple is all possible row of 4. won state is always 4-in-row and two 3-in-row. in next game it would pick up that 3-in-row because it had nice score
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: thats annoying
 mzbear: eh, i had a bug in my futoshiki solver.  that's why it failed the one validator, it timed out. fixed now, and solves annoying test cases in 0.5ms
 mzbear: but when i look at other people's solutions, i cant help to think that i seem to have overengineered mine
 MSmits: reminds me of when my bot would prefer hexes on the edge of the board, to minimize losses in the random rollout from 3 in a row
 jacek: mzbear maybe they use... the search
 mzbear: what, i can upvote my own solutions
 mzbear: accidentally hit the button
 MSmits: jacek how do you solve the problem of having to pick a starting move for yavalath
 MSmits: you need to take into account swap ruke
 MSmits: rule
 MSmits: and you need to train against other starting moves
 MSmits: I would guess you train for each start you'll steal and the one you pick yourself as p1
 jacek: i pick random 1st move
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: 1 out of 9 or 1 out of 61?
 MSmits: oh right, you added symmetry so i assume 9
 jacek: 1 / 9
 MSmits: kk
 jacek: otherwise technically some moves are more frequent than others
 MSmits: yeah, that might not even be bad
 MSmits: since center 7 squares *should* be rare
 mzbear: the pastebin here doesn't let me paste code, says invalid paste id when i try it in a private channel
 jacek: sometimes its broken
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://paste.ofcode.org/AQNWhUuF8bzJSuMpCnYLtW">https://paste.ofcode.org/AQNWhUuF8bzJSuMpCnYLtW</a>
 MSmits: not sure if it works in private channels
 mzbear: just wanted to show eulerscheZahl what i used the bitfield thingie i asked for :D
 MSmits: he;s sleeping
 Astrobytes: Yep. Ol' Gramps Euler has been asleep for some time now
 mzbear: ohwell
 Astrobytes: link him with it tomorrow
 mzbear: oh dear, yavalath looks harsh
 MSmits: because of the hex board?
 jacek: try that without search
 mzbear: the hex board and the rules
 mzbear: yeah, i dont think this is going to work with heuristics of any kind
 MSmits: there's some
 MSmits: check for wins, check for traps etc.
 MSmits: but to use a heuristic to make a plan consisting of multiple parts, seems impossible yeah
 MSmits: board games arent great for simple heuristics usually
 MSmits: if you like heuristics, do code a la mode
 MSmits: its fun 
 struct: one advantage that Yavalath has is that easy for human to see if its winning
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: othello and uttt are much worse that way
 MSmits: oware too
 MSmits: well in oware you got your seed score, but its hard to see whats gonna happen on the board
 jacek: for othello, even pros can do mistakes when doing move
 jacek: as in legality
 MSmits: wow really?
 jacek: rarely but they can forget to flip some stones
 MSmits: I saw a YT earlier where magnus carlsen accidentally gave up his queen in a blitz game :P
 mzbear: code a la mode ... only 4 people in silver league, 148 in legend out of 874 ... hmmmmm
 Astrobytes: it's tough to keep track, ever played it? As a human I mean
 MSmits: i havent, but seen plenty of games 
 MSmits: between pros even
 MSmits: dbdrs bot, jaceks bot etc.
 jacek: magnus blundered in tactics but didnt make illegal move
 MSmits: true
 struct: Well online its hard to make an illegal move on chess
 jacek: though i think there was one game when in check he moved other piece and opponent and refereee didnt notice
 struct: if not impossible
 MSmits: funny
 MSmits: hey any of you play chess occasionally?
 MSmits: I've been playing it sometimes lately
 Astrobytes: not for a wee while tbh
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chessbase.in/news/Carlsen_Inarkiev_controversy">https://chessbase.in/news/Carlsen_Inarkiev_controversy</a>
 struct: I played a bit, but im not very good
 MSmits: whats you're rating at, if you know?
 MSmits: it's all relative
 struct: I think it was 1200-1300 in chesscom
 struct: on rapid
 MSmits: same as me then, also rapid
 MSmits: I do 30 min matches
 struct: I do 10
 struct: or 15
 MSmits: but so far i played only 16 games
 MSmits: and none in the 30 years before that 
 MSmits: i was pretty good as a kid though
 Astrobytes: +1
 MSmits: 10-15 min is too quick for me
 MSmits: i almost run out of time already with 30
 Astrobytes: Used to play clubs and my grandad organised chess conferences here in my town
 MSmits: ah sounds fun
 Astrobytes: I kinda stopped after my mid-late teens
 MSmits: i only stopped because i went from primary school to high school
 MSmits: on my primary school we played chess alll the time
 MSmits: it's what they did for kids that got their week's work done
 Astrobytes: that's cool, half the kids in my class had never even heard of it 
 MSmits: I was usually done by tuesday
 MSmits: if i had chess.com back then i doubt i ever would have stopped
 Astrobytes: Yeah I was like that in primary. Highschool I'd usually do it in the morning it was due or the class before :P
 Astrobytes: *homework that is
 Astrobytes: I see you said week's work
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yeah we had a week thingy
 MSmits: when that was done they had to think of something else
 MSmits: I remember they also gave me little booklet thingies
 Astrobytes: Yeah, similar-ish here
 MSmits: with stupid assignments
 MSmits: I remember one was basically sex education
 MSmits: so they didnt even realize they gave me that
 Astrobytes: lmao
 MSmits: I was like, wth
 MSmits: next time i'll work slower
 Astrobytes: Well... you *hope* they didn't realise they gave you that
 MSmits: right, that
 MSmits: well it was basically stack
 MSmits: to keep me busy
 Astrobytes: yeah, had the same with reading. Could churn through books in no time so used to get a load to get through
 MSmits: my problem was that I didn't like all that many things
 MSmits: I preferred math problems and such
 MSmits: but most of that stuff was language/poetry/essays etc.
 Astrobytes: Same with maths puzzles, I used to do them relenlessly
 Astrobytes: *relentlessly
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: Time to finish Yavalath saga and release Yavalanchor and Yavalax
 MSmits: I didnt really know i could just ask for specific stuff
 Astrobytes: Primary and early highschool I used to be really hot on maths, competitions and stuff. Until I got The Bad Teacher
 MSmits: probably if i had said, yo gimme math stuff, they would have
 Astrobytes: yeah, you don't realise these things at the time though
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: in primary school i had no competition basically
 MSmits: but high school i did plenty
 MSmits: but it was so stressful, i was just happy to get home
 Astrobytes: They wanted to skip me ahead a couple of years but there was no provision to do so in the educational system at the time
 MSmits: well it's never a complete solution anyway
 MSmits: you get problems socializing
 Astrobytes: Only people with a lot of money can do that kinda thing anyway.
 Astrobytes: And yeah, exactly what I was about to say
 MSmits: we had a 10 year old in between 14 year olds at work, some years ago
 Astrobytes: I had a lot of fun without too much pressure
 Astrobytes: how did that go?
 MSmits: i mean, he wasnt just 10, he was obviously also very weird for a 10 year okd
 MSmits: otherwise he wouldnt be there
 Astrobytes: yeah ofc
 MSmits: basically whenever one of the students did something wrong or even got a question wrong
 MSmits: he would tell on them or ridicule them
 MSmits: think sheldon in BB theory
 Astrobytes: yeah, I get it
 MSmits: so one day they kicked him naked out of the gym dressing room and he had to switch class, its kinda sad
 Astrobytes: He didn't have the social skills to realize that he was being a dick
 MSmits: in the end he was ok, but took a while
 MSmits: yeah he was both too young and handicapped in that regard
 Astrobytes: It's a double edged sword isn't it. I think the only thing you can do is nurture the talent as much as you can
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: whether it's academic, sporty, whatever
 MSmits: funny thing is, there were two other students from the same family, that were also 3-4 yrs ahead
 MSmits: one was 4th year university at 18
 MSmits: genetics i suppose
 Astrobytes: And pushy parents most likely
 MSmits: that too
 MSmits: it helps to a degree, but it makes me sad to see parents push a student that doesnt have strong talents
 MSmits: it gets stressful and ruins your childhood
 Astrobytes: It happens so much. They need to encourage and nurture whatever the kid *is* good at - there's always something
 Astrobytes: Not everyone is academically-minded
 MSmits: yeah, and often if the parents apply enough pressure, they can convince a school to let them try at a higher level
 MSmits: which can cause a lot of failure and self esteem problems
 Astrobytes: So a bit of academic material in the context of something practical is wayyyy more beneficial
 Astrobytes: Yes, 100%
 MSmits: i dont know how it is in the UK, but here you can fail a year
 MSmits: and you have to redo the entire yhear
 MSmits: never happened to me, but i bet it feels really crappy
 Astrobytes: yeah, you can do that in highschool and certain years of primary iirc
 MSmits: in the level i teach about 30-50% of students lose a year at some point in their high school career
 MSmits: usually only 1
 Astrobytes: we had a guy who was held back 2 years - he was only dyslexic, but there was no support. He disappeared from school around 14 and went to work in his parents hotel
 Astrobytes: But that was back then
 MSmits: that sucks&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: 30-50%&#160;? Seems pretty high
 MSmits: yeah but it's out of 6 years
 MSmits: its a long high school
 MSmits: so instead of 6, some of them take 7
 struct: Same thing here
 struct:&#160;% checks out
 MSmits: the lower levels have a lot less of this
 MSmits: only about 10% there
 struct: I found perfect game
 struct: re curse will love it
 struct: "Maphex is a derivative of the masterpiece HEX (Piet Hein 1940) where your opponent's move determines which sub-board you can play on (mechanism from Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe)."
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: haha
 MSmits: 3x3 hex?
 Astrobytes: lol 
 struct: 3x3 sub-boards
 MSmits: i am trying to imagine the 3x3 shape
 struct: 9x9 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/322205/maphex">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/322205/maphex</a>
 struct: But they say 16x16 is more "balanced"
 MSmits: is there any difference with uttt?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: ahh yes
 struct: you need to connect your sides
 struct: like a bridge
 MSmits:  1 missing diagonal also
 Astrobytes: (wrt previous topic we have 6 years in Scottish highschool too btw)
 MSmits: we have 4-4-4-5-6
 struct: here is 1-4 grade, 5-6th, 7-12th
 Astrobytes: surprised no-one ported hex already
 MSmits: highest levels are longer
 struct: or its 5-9, 10-12
 struct: cant recall
 Astrobytes: 6th year here is like university preparation
 Astrobytes: well, 6th year studies
 struct: my last year was php
 struct:&#160;:'(
 MSmits: ohh you dont win miniboards in maphex?
 Astrobytes: well, that was in my time, I don't know what it is now
 struct: no MSmits
 struct: you place pieces and need to build a bridge
 MSmits: got it
 struct: See the red and blue corners in the pic?
 MSmits: yea i understand now
 MSmits: this is a more complex game I think
 Astrobytes: you never did original hex?
 MSmits: i didnt
 struct: Yeah its inspired by hex
 Astrobytes: I think these simpler games should be ported also 
 Astrobytes: For people to try stuff on
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: there should be some interest to a leaderboard though
 Astrobytes: Hex I mean, not maphex
 MSmits: if its solvable its no good
 Astrobytes: Practice section would be nice
 MSmits: yeah it would
 struct: yeah I was joking about Maphex
 Astrobytes: (other than the puzzle section I mean)
 MSmits: well its not a bad choice struct, i think there's better out there but still
 struct: I want games that are easy to see whats happening
 MSmits: gomoku has that
 Astrobytes: hex isn't solved is it?
 struct: it is until certain size
 Astrobytes: or weakly solved for some board size or something
 Astrobytes: well, big hex it is then
 MSmits: 10x10 is solved
 MSmits: 11x11 is not
 Astrobytes: more or less the same objective as twixt, just a different way of playing
 MSmits: twixt is so weird
 Astrobytes: get to the other side
 MSmits: it seems to me to be the worst game for a computer vs a human
 MSmits: humans can play it easily
 Astrobytes: I get ruined everytime I play a decent bot
 MSmits: in twixt?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: hmm then i just havent figured out how to code one
 jacek: yellow - symmetries is good. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Mp56MZb.png">https://i.imgur.com/Mp56MZb.png</a> green is against 100ms mcts instead of 10ms
 Astrobytes: I meant as a human
 jacek: why havent i tried it sooner
 Astrobytes: impressive
 MSmits: it;s weird that it would help so much
 MSmits: it's only a factor of 12
 MSmits: thats less than a ply
 jacek: more data, and more balanced weights
 MSmits: then again that calculation time is a factor of 10
 jacek: and hex is solved ultra weakly - its been proven 1st player can always win but there is no strategy to that
 MSmits: I'm looking forward to trying your board on the leaerboard
 MSmits: your last version gave me some new interesting lines of play
 MSmits: from the 3 2 start
 MSmits: your bot i mean
 jacek: its still fixed plies. i have some ideas how to make it more fast with n-tuples
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: yavalath is the game i enjoy the most to search with meta mcts, because I really understand what is happening
 MSmits: othello is a mystery
 struct: I dont even know why I ported Yavalath
 MSmits: cuz you are a stable genius
 struct: I guess I wanted to try SDK and game looked simple enough
 MSmits: I might look at your code
 MSmits: I have to port it to unity
 struct: No, there are better examples
 MSmits: oh?
 jacek: see what you have done. people spend time and $$$ to do the computation
 struct: Yavalath code is a mess
 struct: but you can check it sure
 struct: its on github
 MSmits: it's not wasted $$$, it's pretty cold here in my attic
 Astrobytes: port hex, after Amazons
 MSmits: I like to get heated by Yavajoules
 Astrobytes: Lavajoules
 struct: Ill search papers about Amazons
 MSmits: oh right, must not forget the volcano
 struct: To see if add something new
 Astrobytes: You had a prototype?
 struct: I have yes
 Astrobytes: I don't think anything new is required for amazons
 struct: I guess the voronoi part
 struct: is something not used on a lot of games
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220962504_Monte-Carlo_Opening_Books_for_Amazons">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220962504_Monte-Carlo_Opening_Books_for_Amazons</a>
 Astrobytes: see, Smits will love it
 struct: Maybe voronoi is not used
 MSmits: maybe I can place more solar cells on my roof and power a threadripper
 struct: Threadripper might be overkill
 Astrobytes: well, it is a territory control game
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: But if you want to warm the house, you might want to go intel
 MSmits: i could put a tube to my neighbors house and give him some free heat
 struct: Otherwise go AMD&#160;:)
 MSmits: I got intel
 struct: new ryzens seem good
 MSmits: didnt re curse buy one?
 Astrobytes: Intels inside, AMDs outside
 struct: He wants one I think
 struct: But cant find it
 MSmits: ah
 Astrobytes: the ryzens are looking ridiculous
 MSmits: i am not good enough of a coder to properly use it
 MSmits: i;d just waste tons of power
 Astrobytes: nah, you'd be able to get something out of it man
 MSmits: let me mess around on 1 core, thats safer
 struct: Well if you can use 2 then you can use 12
 MSmits: i mean sometimes i find a bug after 1 week of running
 AntiSquid: ya i got myself a ryzen from 2k series though
 MSmits: what do you do with it/
 AntiSquid: before 3k was announced, but no regrets considering all the drama surrounding its release
 Astrobytes: you'd find it in less time with multi-core msmits
 AntiSquid: some ML stuff for fun
 MSmits: mmh doubt it, it's not my brain thats multithreaded
 AntiSquid: picked it best on what others recommended / use
 Astrobytes: Well, it is
 struct: 16 cores 32 threads 
 struct: too much
 Astrobytes: There is no Too Much
 MSmits: i wonder if for some applications a good GPU will be faster than those 16 cores
 Astrobytes: Think of the combination
 MSmits: its not that easy to combine them, i tried it once
 struct: for rendering mostly
 AntiSquid: my pc is similar to this guy's, i picked and built mine before this video came out though :P <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAv2hHCwcP0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAv2hHCwcP0</a>
 MSmits: i meant for computation
 struct: Maybe for calculations
 struct: idk
 Astrobytes: Well you delegate responsibilities to the appropriate components no?
 MSmits: I did some terrain generation on cpu and gpu. Same algorithm to generate a chunk
 MSmits: gpu did it 20x faster
 AntiSquid: it's more a matter of having both for both scenarios whenever you need them
 MSmits: but there was a delay in transfering the data
 MSmits: bit annoying
 AntiSquid: you can cheap out on one thing but then might regret later or not be able to upgrade something if you want to
 MSmits: makes sense
 Astrobytes: always the way with any hardware
 struct: One thing good on Amazons
 struct: Is that you need to choose good moves
 struct: Search space is massive
 Astrobytes: yes, I picked it for a reason. It's in many, many papers. I think it'll be interesting on CG
 Astrobytes: Also a fun game btw
 Astrobytes: (as a human)
 AntiSquid: you're doing a game astro?
 Astrobytes: no, it's one I suggested to struct ages ago
 Astrobytes: But I wanted to port Morpion Solitaire when I have time
 Astrobytes: (not a card game)
 Astrobytes: aka Join Five
 AntiSquid: i have some fancy game in mind&#160;! (not saying it to brag) just no time and worried about how people might react ... very fussy crowd
 Astrobytes: well, when you have the time just throw it out there
 Astrobytes: I mean, if the idea works it works, if it doesn't it doesn't right
 Astrobytes: If it's got fog tho' I KEEEEL YOU
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 MSmits: now I am imagining you as a skeletal puppet Astrobytes
 struct: jrke submit a contribution
 struct: but no statement yet
 AntiSquid: fencing game looks nice
 Astrobytes: at least you got it MSmits
 Astrobytes: Not played the fencing one since the update(s)
 struct: Whats fencing game?
 Astrobytes: yeah I saw that struct
 Astrobytes: we might need to help him a bit with the english for the statement, he speaks well but will need some assistance 
 Astrobytes: it's somewhere in the contribs struct, Fencing Championships or smth
 MSmits: gonna get some sleep gn!
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn&#160;:)
 struct: I go too, gn
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: oh theres a chat nice
 Astrobytes: gn struct
 Astrobytes: yes there is a chat
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: im new to this site and it just unlocked for me i think
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think it unlocks at level 3, after you solve 1 or 2 puzzles
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: i just did the easy binary search one and then
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: yay
 LastRick: Welcome to Codingame
 Astrobytes: cool, welcome to CG
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: thanks!
 Astrobytes: oh hey LastRick
 LastRick: Howdy
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: from what ive seen this site is mostly just math algos right? like binary search, gaussian elimination
 Astrobytes: noooo
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: ope
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: there's a lot of different problems
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: any fun recs?
 Astrobytes: Requiring many different algorithmic approaches, some very mathematical puzzles indeed.
 Astrobytes: There are multiplayer bot programming games, optimisation games, code golf games... and clashes too
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: oh is golfing scored per language or just bytes of code
 Astrobytes: DEpends what you like/what you're interested in, recommendations are quite subjective
 Astrobytes: codegolf-wise your best score will obviously be your least chars solution, but you get points for golfing in other langs too
 LastRick: And recommendations are subject to change
 Astrobytes: ^
 LastRick: when i first got here, all i wanted to do was puzzles, couldn't stop
 LastRick: after that fall contest, i got hooked on Compete for a while
 Astrobytes: Now?
 Astrobytes: Oh SR
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: what are clashes
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: also whats sr
 Astrobytes: 15-minute timed sessions when you try to solve a problem via opponents either faster than them, with less chars than them or reverse-engineer it faster than them
 Astrobytes: The problems vary in quality
 LastRick: ^ boy do they
 Astrobytes: Clash isn't my thing, but some of the stuff I've seen recently...
 Astrobytes: Anyway, do check out all parts of the site, not just the puzzles!
 Astrobytes: How's your GA coming along LastRick?
 LastRick: I enjoy clashes as a change of pace from the drudgery of a puzzle or the complexity of a Compete. But yeah lately oof
 LastRick: I want to finish Texas Hold Em puzzle (medium) tonight and then I will go back to Search Race. Illedan was so nice to post some generic GA code last night and I was going to use it as a starting point
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: whats ga
 LastRick: Genetic Algorithm
 Astrobytes: Yes I saw that. I think you'll have fun with it.
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: oh cool
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: are the problem difficulties accurate bc the medium one i did was like basic binary searching
 LastRick: not always
 Astrobytes: You can start with just pure random, then introduce mutation. Then after create populations with crossovers
 LastRick: ok
 Astrobytes: No, unfortunately the difficulties can be variable
 Astrobytes: Which puzzle did you do?
 LastRick: When I went through all the Easy puzzles, I found probably a dozen that should have been shifted up. Likewise, I've seen a few Hards that are not very difficult at all.
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Especially when they merged community with official puzzles
 Astrobytes: Though there are a few official which are easier than their category too
 Astrobytes: Again, that's subjective. Depends on your experience of whatever the problem is
 LastRick: I have said for a while, the problem is they haven' done a good job codifying what determines a puzzle's difficulty level. They leave to the user base, which is the worst group to leave it to.&#160;:)
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: ok i have a question about search race
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: "The car's facing vector is multiplied by the given thrust value. The result is added to the current speed vector." is the facing vector a unit vector
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's true to an extent LastRick, doesn't account for the official ones though.
 Astrobytes: well, regarding the facing vector: think that one through for a second
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: i mean it makes sense for it to be but do you know lol
 Astrobytes: It's a direction vector so...
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: ok cool then yes facing vector just isnt a super common phrase in my experience so i wanted to theck
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: *check
 Astrobytes: ah cool, yeah sometimes you have to extrapolate from the description, fair play
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: ah makes sense
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: also is there a vim mode
 Astrobytes: yes there is
 Astrobytes: settings on the left of the IDE
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: ok sweet thank you
 Astrobytes: no worries
 Astrobytes: Anyway, late here, I need to sleep. Goodnight all. LastRick, I hope chat is OK in the next few hours&#160;;)
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: gn
 LastRick: night 
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: how do i watch my test cases play out in the video thing
 Rock-Lee: is the site slow for you guys?
 Rock-Lee: i cant test my code
 Jasperr: It basically happens every night around this time
 LastRick: Oh yeah its that time of night
 LastRick: Flaming: What game are you playing?
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: search race
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: rn im just working out some of the kinematics but i have some ideas
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: weird how positive heading is clockwise
 Rock-Lee: well, time to logout
 LastRick: Yeah, I think that is common to the puzzles here at CG
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: it makes some sense because it works well with top left origin but its still wacky
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: the math is the same as normal math if you pretend its mirrored which is nice ig
 LastRick: On search race, you are talking about the races after you hit submit?
 elderlybeginner: servers seems to be slow now, am I right?
 LastRick: always this time of night (day)
 LastRick: it is when they update the rankings I believe
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: lol i had a small dereferencing bug i figured out the video thing
 LastRick: ok
 Jasperr: this is CG's way of telling Europeans its time to get to bed&#160;;)
 LastRick: yeah, convenient for europe, they should be sleeping. But screw the Americas!&#160;:)
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: aah this discrete calc is so weird
 TheFlamingSkater_651d: its like the difference quotient but its not a limit h is just 1
 katiestapleton: it will always be weird. Happy I have that class done
 LastRick: Texas Holdem finally done. That was something. Probably took only 15 minutes to code if someone has a specific winning hand and 5 hours to format the output.

 AshamanCooper: if you time out, is it possible you just have to much code that is taking a while? I think the code should work, but it is a massive block of logic.
 therealbeef: you can time your code to see if its fast enough
 therealbeef: but often timeouts are actually crashes
 therealbeef: the game engine doesn't see the difference
 AshamanCooper: i have 350 lines of nested ifs.. 
 therealbeef: ifs are fast usually
 AshamanCooper: I thought so, ok thank I will keep combing for an error. 
 therealbeef: sometimes it helps to compile/run the code offline, then you can use debugger for example
 AshamanCooper: Yes I should make a fake input so I can do a single run. problem is it sometimes does a game just fine, and only once and a while times out. 
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: write all the input directly to stderr
 eulerscheZahl: then when you crash again, you have something to analyze offline
 AshamanCooper: stderr?
 eulerscheZahl: error stream
 AshamanCooper: how do you do that?
 eulerscheZahl: there is a comment in the default code telling you how
 eulerscheZahl: which language?
 AshamanCooper: python
 eulerscheZahl: print(the_input, file=sys.err, flush=True)
 Mortis_666: sys.stderr
 eulerscheZahl: my bad
 AshamanCooper: hmm the_input not defined
 eulerscheZahl: you should think a bit what i try to tell you before copying&#160;:(
 AshamanCooper: Well I am new and the pharse makes no sense to me, so copying and trying is the only path to learning here. 
 eulerscheZahl: a snippet from the starter template with error output:
 eulerscheZahl: for i in range(applications_count): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/780cd26a-6f09-4072-bdd7-291f6cc896fa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/780cd26a-6f09-4072-bdd7-291f6cc896fa</a>
 AshamanCooper: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: this will print it like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/IErIN86.png">https://i.imgur.com/IErIN86.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: then you can copy it and plug it into your offline IDE
 AshamanCooper: That will help alot, on a few games. I have been trying to figure out how to use the debug, this helps alot. 
 YS_Yousef: hi
 Suenodk: Hello!
 Soboku: Line 1: gamePhase the name of the current game phase. It can be MOVE, RELEASE^ Seems like the description is incorrect for Bronze
 therealbeef: yeah
 <b>**jacek gasps</b></p><p><img src="/a/35022107863170" /> DaNinja: missing phases

 jacek: real programmers have C blood type
 j4at: B is a programming language
 j4at: and probabl A too&#160;?
 therealbeef: they didnt start at C&#160;;)
 jacek: so there was A# and B#?
 j4at: b# is a programming language
 Illedan: Hi

 Sheeesh---: does CONTUNUOUS integration no longer copy cards&#160;?
 kovi: no (afaik it never did)
 Nerchio: hello kovi how are you liking it so far
 emh: wat submitted code is too big.. noooo. ok time to shrink it
 emh: ahh no it was copy paste fail
 emh: double size
 therealbeef: 50k is still impressive
 Nerchio: i was going to ask what abomination you have written emh
 kovi: hello Nerchioi'm not sure. heuristics are getting too complex nowbut i dont see strategic eval yet
 Nerchio: kovi same, had simple heuristics so far and will probably never do a full sim here but I am afraid of people who will
 Illedan: Complex sim though
 Nerchio: complex is nothing for CG veterans 
 eulerscheZahl: imaginary numbers are complex
 eulerscheZahl: this early in the contest and almost no python/JS in top20. that's unusual
 eulerscheZahl: i'm above M_C I think i can take a break now
 Nerchio: but there's typescript

 Soboku: Does Bronze league have small applications?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Nikanameu: what is the starcade stream
 Strawbot: Hi everyone&#160;! Where can i find a reference about how precisly the motor in Mad Pod Racing works?
 Strawbot: like what does the power value represents exactly?
 MSmits: acceleration
 MSmits: on the pain page you can find information written up by several players, the one by magus has a lot of information about how the calculations work
 MSmits: main page
 MSmits: (of mad pod racing)
 Crosility: @MSmits, the discussion tab?
 Crosility: Or do you mean the external references?
 Strawbot: Yes but is it like acceleration in pixel/s^2 really?
 therealbeef: pixels/turn^2, but basically it adds a vector to the current velocity vector (after reducing the old velocity vector with a factor)
 Strawbot: I know there was a page that explained exactly the formula but i can't find it back
 eulerscheZahl: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 Illedan: Nice rank euler
 eulerscheZahl: getting close to you&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: but no idea what i'm seeing in the replays. really hard to follow
 eulerscheZahl: extra frame would be helpful to show skill usage. and automated cards in UI
 therealbeef: automated cards are in player icon hover info
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: aah
 therealbeef: the little pawn
 therealbeef: it was added in one of the updates this weekend
 eulerscheZahl: didn't see that coming. was hovering over my avatar and such
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the projects added at the admin desk
 Strawbot: thx @eulerscheZahl, i think it was this, but why is it for CSB?
 eulerscheZahl: the game was renamed
 eulerscheZahl: someone was paranoid about copyright (the empire strikes back)
 Illedan: Smart idea to print all actions on the next location euler
 Illedan: I'll do that too
 eulerscheZahl: i just do a bestState.ToString()
 eulerscheZahl: was easier to debug in IDE that way
 Strawbot: Is the angle of the pod discontinuous? Like can it jump from theta to theta + 18 in one turn?
 ZumTheZazaKing: helllo
 eulerscheZahl: and i also like to filter in order to trigger certain bugs more easily
 PatrickMcGinnisII: during a move phase, i detect that an app can be released ... but no release phase follows the move?
 eulerscheZahl: then your detection is faulty
 eulerscheZahl: replay?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, app requires:0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0
 struct: is it the last app?
 struct: you cant use shoddy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3  hand
 struct: if its the last one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the bonus should take care of the study cards
 struct: Is it the last app patrick?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no actually there are 4 .... oh yes it is
 struct: So thats why it doesnt work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all 4 apps are releasable...but there is a rule about last app i guess
 struct: Yes, you can use shoddy points for last app
 struct: you cant*
 jacek: if there was something like that in the statement...
 Nerchio: Beware, since this hackathon is on the theme of Green IT, the referees will be paying close attention to the quality of the last released application.The 5th application of each team cannot be released with shoddy skills!
 jacek: and the contest was 4th app
 PatrickMcGinnisII: are all rules in wood1?
 struct: no
 struct: But I think that one is there
 jacek: i think is from the begining
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm very far behind
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just prioritizing possible moves, works ... but not for last app apparently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just random bot has me ranked at 600 something ... trying to make sure next submit gets me in bronze
 jacek: try first action
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I prioritize releases as well to reduc e debt, seems to work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: was gonna just MCTS after i get the bones working
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I assummed bronze would be a complete rewrite
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall beam searching?
 jacek: searching? Oo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of random stuff going on
 eulerscheZahl: search space is small enough to do it without pruning (current turn only)
 struct: I must try that
 waterproofsodium: hi stroct
 waterproofsodium: hope you're not strict :p
 MSmits: mmh I was top 100 with a sim that used technical debt as bonus cards to release apps
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and now you are 554th with 0% progress
 MSmits: perhaps its sheer confidence in ignoring the rules got it wins
 darkhorse64: rules are for the weak
 MSmits: yeah i am going to have to recalibrate my eval, but it seems reasonably good so far
 Kellthazar: Submitted a new version: 15 loses in a row. 
 MSmits: plot twist: All wins after that
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if this game has enough strategic depth to keep us busy for another week
 struct: just start making an opening book
 MSmits: didn't silver open on sunday last contest?
 MSmits: i remember everything seemed a day early
 struct: I think so
 MSmits: i like when it opens on monday
 MSmits: because less people coding means less congestion. Sundays are bad
 MSmits: wow this bot is a lot better
 struct: Im still trying to find how to code the move
 MSmits: have several phases for the move
 MSmits: move -&gt; throw -&gt; give -&gt; gain
 MSmits: pass the required information (move target, desk target) through the functions
 MSmits: so that at the end you can use gain to get the card
 MSmits: do some ifs an such to skip throw and/or give if necessary
 struct: I have similar thing but its broken I think
 MSmits: yeah this entire sim is easily broken
 MSmits: hard to test
 struct: I store the pending move if it stops at admin or it has to give a card
 struct: But something is wrong with it
 MSmits: ye been there
 MSmits: but in my case it's usually something dumb because c++
 MSmits: functions that don't return anything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, 2nd submit of event gonna happen now that i can beat wood 1 boss
 jacek: youre avoiding the voids?
 MSmits: no i have voids
 MSmits: just not all
 LIMESAUR: Bruh I forgot how to code when I learned it a few months ago
 LIMESAUR: I litterally can't think of the stuff I wanna use
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: bruh
 LIMESAUR: ikr
 struct: I never knew how to code so can't relate
 MSmits: ye struct just makes structs, but they never do anything so it's not really coding
 LIMESAUR: LOL
 LIMESAUR: so they just submit the code right away?
 waterproofsodium: that spaghettis clash is great!
 LIMESAUR: cool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: waterproofsodium now I'm hungry tx
 waterproofsodium: :p
 waterproofsodium: *gives patrick 1 spaghetti
 j4at: Why you fix a bug in your code to findout that the buggy version is better&#160;:'(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: (void *)My_Stomach
 j4at: I gave up on the event
 struct: I dont give up anymore on these
 jacek: you never know it its last
 struct: Just aim for a plausible goal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, wth is an admin desk
 struct: taxes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh yea, made bronze on 2nd submit
 MSmits: well done
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how the hell did i geet a timeout
 Miki09: 36°C here in czech republic
 Miki09: global warming is real guys
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and we are in a solar minimum cycle
 Ramdeath: question, i have 10 cards in draw pile. In what order they go to hand?
 struct: random
 struct: They get randomized when they go from discard pile to draw pile
 struct: so you never know the correct order
 Ramdeath: so i just can see cards but dont know order right?
 struct: yes
 Ramdeath: tnx
 waterproofsodium: Miki09 I feel you
 waterproofsodium: 32 and I bet we'll seen &gt; 36C soon too :P
 j4at: "Just aim for a plausible goal" yeah that's why I decided to give up on the event :3
 Miki09: lol
 struct: Its actually not hot at all in portugal
 struct: &lt;30C
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 31c here, but forecast is for 37+
 j4at: 36 is hot&#160;? Amateurs
 struct: humidity is also important
 j4at: Well today is 31 here
 j4at: but few days ago it was 40
 struct: Same here 40
 struct: Will probably reach close to 50 in some zones
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &gt;60% humidity here
 struct: Once I rode my bicycle with 40ºC+ 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rains everyday, Florida...wait 5 minutes, weather will change
 struct: Never felt so much pain
 jacek: better start training more NNs on computers
 waterproofsodium: rip 40 is when I stop coding xD
 MSmits: Did you remember to put the saddle on?
 struct: My hearth rate was 20 bpm avg higher with the same effort
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, stabilized at rank 299, i guess i suck
 struct: It was a good experiment though 
 struct: Now I know that heat impacts bpm

 waterproofsodium: someone make a optimization problem to lower earth temperature through terraforming without starting a new ice age :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only gonna get worse next couple years
 emh: is there a tool that tells you how many wins you have when you are player 1 versus when you are player 2?
 j4at: time to move to Antarctica and start my own empire
 struct: yes emh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: avg. temp goes +4 deg. and crops die...crops die...we die ... your AI needs to optimize mushroom growth

 Astrobytes: can't you use brutaltester for that purpose?
 waterproofsodium: patrick something tells me we will end up serving our mushroom overlords
 struct: best way to find if the game is balanced is to output random
 struct: for both players
 MSmits: you mean we'll be addicted to shrooms?
 struct: for N games
 struct: Here would always be a tie
 waterproofsodium: :D
 struct: so you cant use the random that the referee provides
 emh: I want to know if my opening strategy for p1 or p2 is worse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Shrooms have the best protein/fat ratio to sub for meats... cause good luck getting those
 struct: MSmits how many states do you usually need to bruteforce?
 struct: is the number in millions?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Plant pineapples, they take full sun well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but don't produce much
 waterproofsodium: yeah or you'll attract pineapple pirates
 MSmits: let me do a few tests struct, it's very variable
 struct: maybe the worst case is enough
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 'Mericans have alot of dogs and guns.&#160;;)  
 MSmits: yeah but i need data for that
 MSmits: probably a few thousand?
 MSmits: maybe 10k or so?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: First player should have an advantage because players pull from same app list
 struct: oh
 struct: I thought it would be way worse
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: this is with allowing up to 3 cards played in the sim
 MSmits: not 4
 MSmits: also most turns it is &lt; 100
 PatrickMcGinnisII: play card phase screws up my thinking
 MSmits: a few in the mid 100s
 MSmits: rarely over 1k
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: move phase with daily routine + training/coding will cause a lot of branching
 struct: Im thinking on using union for the cards
 MSmits: just remember, there's never more than 55 ways to draw 2 cards
 MSmits: 10 + 10*9/2
 MSmits: the only thing that differs between these 55 ways is the probability of it happening
 struct: Thanks Ill remeber that
 MSmits: but no need to branch more than this
 MSmits: but chain trainings will still give you 55*55*55*...
 MSmits: assuming you have all cards in your pile multiple times
 MSmits: which is very unlikely
 Illedan: Games would end in &lt; 10 turns
 MSmits: when?
 Illedan: 1 turn = 1 move
 MSmits: we are just talking about simming 1 full turn
 Illedan: So you can't get too many cards
 MSmits: you can do many trainings in 1 turn
 MSmits: and coding
 Illedan: Yeah, but you can't manage to get that many before the game ends
 MSmits: you can only release 1 app in a turn, it doesnt really matter how many turns after that. Since we're not simming those. We're just making sure the current turn doesn't crash us
 MSmits: which it definitely can
 Illedan: ah
 MSmits: (if you dont limit your plays)
 Illedan: To validate all sequence of actions?
 Illedan: *card plays
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: to score them with eval
 MSmits: just made my depth go up 1, allowing 4 plays. No crashes so far
 MSmits: iterations: 12771 one time
 MSmits: iterations: 12188   so yeah, more
 MSmits: manageable though
 MSmits: I think this game has a cool ending

 MSmits: I calculate win% based on draw probability
 MSmits: my orders were:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/32883961-7bf7-48df-8c54-63aa016373d2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/32883961-7bf7-48df-8c54-63aa016373d2</a>
 struct: nice
 MSmits: so while no random happens win% stays at 30%, then i have an unlucky coding draw and it goes down to 8%, but i still win
 MSmits: mmh now i wonder if i got a better rank due to allowing more plays or if it's just luck
 struct: you can always submit again
 struct: maybe you were unlucky
 struct: and you deserved even a better rank
 MSmits: possible yeah
 MSmits: nowhere near beating those if-guys though, but i got a reasonable bot. Probably need to be more creative with eval or just choose better parameters
 struct: It's only a matter of time
 struct: before their downfall
 MSmits: well they'll stay high but a few simmers will pass them
 MSmits: possibly one with a NN
 Miki09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642804441">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642804441</a>Why cant I release application 14 in frame 76?
 eulerscheZahl: you have nothing automated
 eulerscheZahl: your 1 card that fits the required skills isn't enough
 eulerscheZahl: you have 2 good and 4 shoddy skills
 Miki09: what is meant by automated?
 struct: You can automate cards
 struct: so they can be used to release apps
 eulerscheZahl: using the continuous integration skill prior to the release
 Miki09: oh ok thanks
 struct: antiwonto why can't I release
 struct: Should be a command
 MSmits: 2 good and 4 shoddy skills? Is that possible?
 MSmits: oh in total, with wrong cards i guess
 eulerscheZahl: can you complete a project with 8 shoddy?
 Nerchio: why not
 eulerscheZahl: not that i would want to do it, technical debt would kill you
 struct: if you want to lose
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i added an extra rule that 50% of my skills must not be shoddy
 eulerscheZahl: to my move gen
 struct: I dont really like to limit my move gen
 eulerscheZahl: then i don't have to check of i have enough shoddy on top
 eulerscheZahl: me neither, a good eval should figure it out
 TimothyAlexisVass: :taco: struct
 MSmits: yeah i have that rule as well eulerscheZahl
 struct: my ears
 MSmits: 50% much be non-shoddy. I thought this was necessary
 eulerscheZahl: i start to hate those tacos
 darkhorse64: your stomach mainly
 j4at: :taco: eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: even changed it to at most 2 shoddy skills
 MSmits: well you can just make that part of the eval cant you?
 MSmits: if you eval TD, you will have more
 MSmits: I could try and see what happens if i force a max of 2
 eulerscheZahl: i know...one step after another
 struct: I'm gonna bitboard this I cant resist it
 MSmits: I'm afraid to do that
 MSmits: I will cause more bugs than i can find before next weekend
 eulerscheZahl: oh, a new jim browning video online
 struct: all the cards should fit into 64 bits easily
 struct: instead of the arr[10] I have
 struct: Anyways it might be a waste of time but im willing to risk it I guess
 MSmits: yeah they will fit, but the question is: What operation will be faster in bitboard?
 MSmits: copying and memsetting will be faster i suppose
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e21058e-6102-4ba2-8c9b-ef26de92a729">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e21058e-6102-4ba2-8c9b-ef26de92a729</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i see nothing wrong with this :D
 MSmits: there really isn't. I just increased my max played per turn to 4, allowing 4 cards to be played and still get only 12k iterations on a bad turn
 MSmits: possibly 5 is also realistic
 MSmits: after reviewing my code and getting the last bugs out i'll try submit with 5
 eulerscheZahl: i still do redundant stuff. likeTHROW 5 | THROW 6THROW 6 | THROW 5
 MSmits: ahh yes, easily fixed with a loop using i from 0 to 9 and j from i+1 to 9. I used that in a couple places
 MSmits: I just noticed task prioritization takes a card from my hand and from the board, but doesnt put any new cards
 struct: japan at the top again
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Invisible cards, cool  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642833632">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642833632</a>
 aangairbender: I see top1 doesnt really care about technical debt cards at all
 aangairbender: getting ~20 before releasing 5th
 MSmits: that doesnt mean they dont care, you get 20 pretty easily
 aangairbender: I liked siman strat though, he got rid of all debt cards as soon as he could
 aangairbender: it was kinda elegant imo
 aangairbender: all deck is around 5 cards, so can predict the next draw pretty reliably
 kovi: eulerscheZahlhere, the wild change of meta may bring the depth for next week
 eulerscheZahl: not that new, saw it in other high ranked bots before
 kovi: up to now...we mostly tried to play our own game
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's what you mean? use the few cards against him by trying to block?
 kovi: yes
 kovi: some of the new meta are extremely susceptible to that...
 eulerscheZahl: as always, i'm already tired of the "meta" discussion. i'll just see what you guys pull up and take my own path
 MSmits: i totally agree, I much rather spend time tinkering with my meta mcts
 Palmipedus: has anyone bug on training? I just play a train card, and I have still things to do bug it goes to Release phase
 Nerchio: don't follow the meta, create it :sunglasses:
 struct: do you have a replay Palmipedus?
 MSmits: iterations: 809388  woops, I guess sometimes 4 cards is too much&#160;:)
 kovi: Palmipedus it is known bug, hopefully going to be fixed soon, check forum
 Nerchio: MSmits cries in java :disappointed:
 Palmipedus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642836433">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642836433</a>
 MSmits: i can do some optimizations to reduce the chance later
 MSmits: or i just reduce to playing 3 cards in sim
 Palmipedus: frame 37, it after I train it goes to release phase and find nothing obvioulsy :D
 MSmits: or even better, iterative search like a minimax
 Palmipedus: kovi ha, I thought it was fixed
 struct: oh I hope its fixed
 struct: Thats a big bug
 gokubill: hi
 Palmipedus: that's a bit annoying it's a part of my strat to use Training :D
 MSmits: does it perhaps do this on 5th app when you have a win? In that case you can just finish the game
 struct: no
 struct: he only had 1 app
 Nerchio: will you simulate stuff like, training into chance of drawing another training and training it again? MSmits
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: when my draw pile is empty and i want to draw some more cards: will it swap draw and discard?
 MSmits: thats why i just timed out 
 MSmits: i allow 4 plays in a  row, this time it was too much
 struct: discard cards will go into draw pile euler
 eulerscheZahl: within the same turn already?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 MSmits: draw pile had 2x training and 1x coding, hand had training, thats a lot of draw
 eulerscheZahl: just the PLAYED_CARDS won't
 struct: yeah
 struct: played cards will go at end of the turn so after release or no more plays
 StevenV: hello guysz
 struct: hi
 jacek: ohayou
 Miki09: Is it worth it to try to release applications completely without shoddy skills? (Siman does it)
 jacek: thats so not agile
 StevenV: so you guys seems successfull with smimulation and an algorithm
 struct: not me
 MSmits: yeah StevenV, but it's actually a very simple algorithm, we try all possible moves in the current turn then pick the one we eval as best
 kovi: im halfway (heuristic + some sim)
 MSmits: the execution is hard because of the complexity of the simulation
 Palmipedus: and the bugs
 MSmits: but the actual search is very simple
 MSmits: yeah the bugs come from the complexity, i am currently trying to fix a task prio bug, it's trying to play cards it doesnt have
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, reduced movment thru admin and jumped into top 200
 StevenV: just wonder if silver boss open and bronze boss show up, then all the Bronze league will get recalcuated right?
 struct: no
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: not if they do it right
 MSmits: they can just copy the top X from bronze into silver league and put the bosses at the top of both leagues
 StevenV: ah
 MSmits: if they do it wrong, they will not recalculate bronze, but silver would be fully recalculated
 MSmits: this happened last contest. It causes a ton of server load
 MSmits: ruining the rest of the day for everyone
 StevenV: does it will be same for gold and legend too?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: legend is different on the last day though
 MSmits: when the contest ends, top legend will have a special recalculation
 MSmits: (more battles)
 StevenV: I mean only when the league open
 MSmits: yeah thats the same
 Zylo: TRAINING will be fix?:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642844163">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642844163</a>in 73 I played: TRAININGI have a lot of skills and in 74 I got RELEASE phase&#160;:-(
 StevenV: thanks
 MSmits: oh, legend is very hard to get into at first, its usually only top 15 or so
 kovi: Zylo hopefully soon. reported 2 days ago
 kovi: the more sim, the more trouble it causes
 Zylo: kovi do you know what it depends on?
 kovi: (i semidisabled it)
 kovi: dont know
 Zylo: I have no sim&#160;:-D
 StevenV: do you guys know if top 5 uses some algorithms with sim or heuristic?
 MSmits: both
 StevenV: oh
 jacek: they use jacekmax of course
 MSmits: generally sim based bots take more time to code and will take over later in the contest
 MSmits: some rare contests keep heuristic bots in the top 5 all the way till the end. Some have even been won by heuristic bots (code a la mode for example)
 MSmits: I got into top 5 on code royale with what was mostly heuristic (i did not know how to sim back then and it was hard anyways)
 jacek: spring 2021 had some heuristic bots in legend, despite being good for sim
 struct: Are you trying to tell me that a NN will win again?
 MSmits: it could
 MSmits: theres always room for a limited NN, using it for parts of the game
 eulerscheZahl: a bug in the game, that explains why me making a more accurate sim on training lowered the rank
 jacek: yeah, blame it on a bug in game
 eulerscheZahl: it's easy to blame yourself. but it's even easier to blame someone else
 eulerscheZahl:  - Homer Simpson
 MSmits: ohh is that why i cant get past rank 50. Too much training?
 jacek: overfitting
 eulerscheZahl: jump of the hype train MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: off
 MSmits: the train train?
 Nerchio: if training sometimes stops your skill casting then I can see you lose better moves trying to prolong your turn
 MSmits: yeah, my bot even does win-checking based on this
 MSmits: based on chain-training/coding
 eulerscheZahl: do we know under which circumstances the train chain breaks?
 MSmits: someone should study the source
 MSmits: you were bored right euler?
 Nerchio: xdd
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 MSmits: well you are good at finding this stuff
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care enough :D
 MSmits: ahh ok
 OldJohn: Anyone succeed in making brutaltester work with green circle&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: also some theory about software reliability: the more bugs you find, the more likely it is that there are more hiding
 MSmits: maybe i will do it in the train tomorrow if i have wifi
 ganbat24: jesus too many things to read and intro is in french
 eulerscheZahl: no point in making a brutal tester yet, as long as there are such bugs in the referee
 MSmits: i didnt use the intro ganbat24
 struct: isnt this the bug?
 eulerscheZahl: you can just git clone and analyze offline
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/72b73dce8ee2a00118ceab33c4d20439d901a742/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L144">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/72b73dce8ee2a00118ceab33c4d20439d901a742/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L144</a>
 MSmits: just read the statement 20 times like everyone else. And then ask a bunch of questions
 ganbat24: yeah but then i have to read
 MSmits: indeed
 struct: I think the bug is in there
 struct: so before playing the training the remaining plays get set to 0
 struct: then you play trianinng
 struct: remaining plays get increase to 1
 ganbat24: but i am sleepy i thought i should make a naive solution then go sleep
 struct: you enter this again
 struct: and go back to 0
 struct: maybe you dont even get to play a card at all if you can complete an app
 struct: I havent checked 
 MSmits: only if you cant play an action card
 struct: ah ok
 struct: i was wrong
 struct: Maybe nopt
 struct: not*
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: I wonder
 MSmits:           first you remove one play
 MSmits: then you ask the question is plays &lt;= 0
 MSmits: you already removed one, so if you had 1, you just lost it
 struct: yeah but playing training adds 1 more play
 MSmits: yeah but what if it was 0 already
 MSmits: then you just added 1 and lost it again before starting the next phase
 JohnyDaison: what do you guys mean when you talk about a sim, exactly?
 MSmits: so you start at 0. Then training adds one, then that line removes 1 and you dont get another phase
 struct: you start at 1 when you enter the phase
 MSmits: JohnyDaison try out moves and simulate what happens to figure out what is best
 MSmits: where does it say this struct
 struct:  private void startPlayCardPhase(Player player) {
 MSmits: trying to find that in referee
 struct: line 169
 struct: of Referee java
 MSmits: ok, but that adds 1
 MSmits: what was it before
 MSmits: what if it was -1
 struct: ah
 struct: :medal:
 struct: that might be it MSmits
 struct: I dont know
 MSmits: maybe yeah, me neither
 struct: But it seems to be plausible
 JohnyDaison: Is there a replay where this problem is visible?
 struct: Let me run 100k games offline to check if ever goes below 0
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642844163">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642844163</a>
 struct: 73*
 struct: frame
 struct: give me a few minutes MSmits Ill report back
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: 'm here all day
 struct: Is there anything like assert for java?
 Nerchio: assert
 Nerchio: assert 1==2; xd
 struct: It doesnt crash the program?
 struct: Nerchio whats the easiest way to crash the program?
 Palmipedus: Can we do Prio with a Bonus card?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: on both indices
 jacek: Object x = null; x.toString()
 Palmipedus: great to know
 Nerchio: ^ or throw exception
 Palmipedus: thena MSmits
 struct: ty jacek
 jacek: or just run the program
 Miki09: how many of bronze players will auto go to silver?
 MSmits: 200?
 MSmits: is my guess
 Miki09: ok
 Miki09: 50 more places to push
 JohnyDaison: Regarding the replay, during the combo on turn 55 it worked fine, but then on turn 65 CODING was played, and there was only one WAIT after it, which doesn't seem correct.
 Palmipedus: MSmits thanks not thena :D
 struct: MSmits
 struct: -10
 struct: You are right
 struct: System.err.println(player.getPlaysLeft());player.addMorePlays(1);System.err.println(player.getPlaysLeft());
 Nerchio: so just make a function that sets it to 0 there instead of add 1
 struct: set it to 1
 struct: not 0
 Nerchio: true
 struct: kovi this might be the bug
 MSmits: nice one struct. Should post it
 struct: [SG]Sebastien are you there by any chance?
 struct: I think he might be online
 jacek: there are few fixed bugs pending for release
 Illedan: There is a bug with training?
 Illedan: and coding?
 kovi: im not sure about coding thoughmaybe that is because of the 2x draw "mess"(it is messy to implement it in simu + gameflow)
 Illedan: In your code?
 struct: Ok posted on forum hopefully it will be fixed
 MSmits: Illedan sometimes when the playphase starts, playsleft is -1 instead of 0
 MSmits: when the playphase is started, 1 is added, which normally means it is 1 
 MSmits: but in this case it would be 0
 MSmits: you would still get 1 play
 MSmits: but then with training, 0+1 becomes 1
 MSmits: then when setting next phase, 1 play is subtracted
 MSmits: meaning no bonus play
 MSmits: so either they have to figure out why playsleft becomes -1, or they just always start a first playphase with plays = 1
 MSmits: the first option is the better fix as it might be a second bug
 Miki09: somehow my first iteration says it runs 3 seconds
 Miki09: hmmm
 MSmits: your time measuring is off
 Illedan: Thx for explaining
 MSmits: first start reading input, then start the timer
 Miki09: I dont know why
 jacek: dat time dilation
 Miki09: its copied from SO&#160;:-)
 Miki09: so it should work
 MSmits: SO?
 Miki09: stack overflow
 jacek: queue overflow
 MSmits: Miki09 the lines of code are not wrong
 MSmits: the place where you put them is
 MSmits: you put the start of your time measurement before readint the input
 eulerscheZahl: read inputstart timerdo somethingstop timer and print action
 Miki09: ok thanks
 Smekarn: If I'd like to test my Green Circle bot offline, where can I read up on how to get a game simulator going?
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits 06:23ᴾᴹSO?
 MSmits: if you do it before reading input, you basically started your timer in your previous turn, this means you measure the entire opponents turn + the referee time
 Miki09: now it shows 0.00019693374633789062&#160;:-)
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 MSmits: indeed eulerscheZahl
 Miki09: seems like I have plenty of more time to simulate
 eulerscheZahl: you clone the github repo and import is as a project in the IDE of my (not your) choice: IntelliJ
 MSmits: yeah for this contest (if that is what you are doing) you have plenty of time
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/how-to-run-ocean-of-code-github-project-locally/168041/3">https://forum.codingame.com/t/how-to-run-ocean-of-code-github-project-locally/168041/3</a>
 Smekarn: Thanks @euler
 struct: I also use IntelliJ it does everything alone
 struct: I only need to right click and run
 struct: but im a windows user, so that might explain it
 jacek: :rage:
 Smekarn: IntelliJ it is then
 MSmits: hmm i might try that
 eulerscheZahl: even is a linux use i prefer intelliJ for this task
 MSmits: i've never been succesful before 
 eulerscheZahl: and i strongly hate eclipse
 struct: vscode also works decently well for this
 struct: but requires a bit more work
 jacek: lunar eclipse or sun eclipse
 struct: One interesting thing on the bug that triggered 
 struct: was that it didnt happen after a training card was played
 struct: It happened after a throw
 struct: But the player could still play a card
 MSmits: yeah because the first play is free
 MSmits: but because playsleft = -1, the bonus play doesnt go high enough
 struct: He didnt play because I crashed the referee
 MSmits: right, but i mean if he had
 TMP161112: can i have some help
 TMP161112: please
 struct: ok maybe my fix will not work
 OldJohn: @jacek you have a lot of technical debts&#160;!
 jacek: is it bad?
 OldJohn: yes probably&#160;!
 MSmits: not if you win
 OldJohn: SSS
 MSmits: nake?
 OldJohn: Small statistical sample
 jacek: does having PLAYED_CARDS in inputs give some advantage/
 MSmits: :snake:
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: jacek yes, you cant play those again and you cant draw them again when your draw pile is empty and discard gets shuffled into draw
 MSmits: so during that entire turn, no matter what you do, you cant use those cards
 jacek: oh
 MSmits: if they are in discard, you may be able ot
 MSmits: by using training cards if your draw pile is almost empty
 MSmits: also you need to take them into account when calculating desk cards
 MSmits: if they are in played, they are not in desk
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan — Today at 6:27 PM@eulerscheZahl I think the bug msmits is talking about occurs when you dont play cards in the play phase. Because it is subtracted every play phase. On my phone now, but can you tell him?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what you were talking about, was eating dinner
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, i was even chatting at that time. then i'll go with bad memory or lack of attention
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 emh: lol check my automated cards in last frame of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642887779">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642887779</a>
 Illedan: So it will be fixed when setting to 1 before the play frame
 struct: no idea Illedan
 Illedan: I think so
 struct: It might create more bugs
 struct: :D
 Illedan: Nah
 eulerscheZahl: where are the unit tests?
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i'm also a bit lax when it comes to them. but for a more complex game (tryangle catch) i wrote some and it really helped
 eulerscheZahl: struct what are you doing on the forum?
 eulerscheZahl: Object x = null;x.toString();
 struct: just to make it crash
 jacek: good thing you told that
 eulerscheZahl: throw new Exception()
 jacek: otherwise theyd put it into the code
 struct: lol
 Illedan: :D
 struct: I just follow jacek advice euler
 Illedan: Why don't you think setting 1 works struct?
 eulerscheZahl: do we have a replay where it happens?
 Illedan: Forum has some of them
 struct: look at this
 eulerscheZahl: forum is long
 struct: let me upload 1 sec
 eulerscheZahl: do we need staff to deploy fixes?
 Illedan: For a Contest I think so yes
 struct: because sometimes the actions start at 0 Illedan
 struct: the getPlaysLeft
 Illedan: So setting it to 1 should fix that?
 struct: but I could make the action
 struct: if its 0
 struct: its still legal
 Illedan: Not really
 struct: So after move
 struct: -10
 Illedan: it doesn't check when entering the PLAY_CARD state
 struct: inputs next turn
 Illedan: Only inbetween
 Illedan: I think
 struct: 3TRAININGRANDOMWAIT
 struct: The -1 to 0 occurs way to often
 MSmits: is it possible for there to be 37 bonus cards in total?
 Illedan: Yeah, the amount of plays you have left is not checked before the first PLAY_CARD
 struct: so setting it to 1 should be fine right?
 Illedan: Yes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642891364">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642891364</a>  around frame 95 i add up 37 bonus cards. 
 kovi: nice catch
 kovi: struct
 eulerscheZahl: did you verify that it solves the issue?
 struct: No
 Illedan: I'll test it locally
 struct: Thats why I edited my post
 struct: :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/?id=642495725">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/?id=642495725</a>
 eulerscheZahl: happy hardcoding
 Illedan: He did push it set to 1
 struct: ok
 avdg: guudevening
 MSmits: guys, can you check my replay, i think this is a serious bug also
 MSmits: 37 bonus cards total
 struct: it is 37 bonus
 eulerscheZahl: "Trying to fix the bug"very convincing
 struct: It will even break my bot MSmits
 MSmits: yes struct
 MSmits: how can this be?
 struct: if all 37 are in player hand
 struct: my bot wont like it
 eulerscheZahl: are the 36 in total or in the center?
 struct: 36-37 = -1;
 MSmits: 37 in total in the game
 eulerscheZahl: 36 + initial bonus in hand?
 MSmits: oh wait
 eulerscheZahl: questioning the rules
 struct: Its 36 in total euler
 MSmits: i am not sure
 struct: 36 in the game
 MSmits: at frame 21 there are 38
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: could be a viewer thing
 eulerscheZahl: in turn 1 it says 28 left in tooltip
 eulerscheZahl: so 36 in total
 MSmits: yeah in turn 1 it is fine
 MSmits: frame 20, also 37
 eulerscheZahl: do you store stdin?
 MSmits: seems to happen during training on frame 16
 MSmits: you can see it go from 36 to 37
 eulerscheZahl: would be easier than tooltips of a possibly buggy viewer
 eulerscheZahl: but i agree: stays 37 for the frames after as well
 MSmits: yeah i dont have the full stdin
 MSmits: i have some calculated results that are 1 off after this point
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 MSmits: i calculate whats on the board and my results are 1 lower
 MSmits: than the viewer says
 MSmits: thats how i spotted it
 struct: let me see if I can reproduce 
 eulerscheZahl: starts pretty early to be off
 MSmits: i think maybe i was supposed to throw 2 bonus cards and it threw 1
 MSmits: yeah thats it
 MSmits: I threw 2 bonus cards to the board
 MSmits: but only lost 1 bonus card
 MSmits: yay
 MSmits: on frame 14
 eulerscheZahl: from 14 to 15 you have to throw 2 cards
 eulerscheZahl: you only throw 1
 kovi: that is a known bug
 kovi: already fixed, just not published
 eulerscheZahl: oh i'm slow
 MSmits: how many known bugs are there lol
 eulerscheZahl: forum thread is too long to follow
 kovi: i counted 3 notorious bugs there multiplied by time (slow fixing)(3rd was the infinite)
 kovi: (which was fixed relatively fast)
 darkhorse64: Can you throw/give bonus card&#160;? According to the statement, no but I am unsure
 MSmits: you can
 darkhorse64: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: you can also TASK_PRIORITIZE into a bonus
 MSmits: the term skill card is used inconsistently
 eulerscheZahl: which isn't allowed according to inputs
 MSmits: sometimes they mean non-bonus, sometimes it includes bonus cards
 eulerscheZahl: except if they fixed that, no idea
 MSmits: when you can "play a skill card" then its not bonus
 MSmits: when you have to "give a skill card" it includes bonus
 darkhorse64: French statement is also ambiguous
 eulerscheZahl: it's a green contest
 eulerscheZahl: like a green banana. not ripe yet
 MSmits: all French is ambiguous to me. It can mean anything
 struct: I dont know why this game crashes when I try to play multiple games
 MSmits: locally?
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: some static stuff?
 MSmits: is it vanilla or have you been fixing bugs?
 struct: ah must be that eule
 eulerscheZahl: IDs out of range or so
 struct: Yeah thats the reason I think euler
 eulerscheZahl: had a similar experience for locam(?) long ago
 struct: Im not fixing bugs MSmits
 MSmits: ah
 struct: Just wanted to spot the bug you mentioned
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: to check if its tooltip or game bug
 eulerscheZahl: game bug
 struct: Anyone found out why yet?
 MSmits: we know where it happens
 eulerscheZahl: we discussed that. frame 14 to 15
 MSmits: it happens when you throw cards
 eulerscheZahl: throwing only 1 card
 struct: ah ok
 MSmits: perhaps when you only have bonus cards
 MSmits: as that was the case fo rme
 struct: Has this been reported?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: kovi says so
 eulerscheZahl: he says fixed but not deployed
 struct: :thumbsup:
 struct: Time to get back into my bot
 struct: havent coded anything for it today
 eulerscheZahl: japan isn't happy either<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/_simanman">https://twitter.com/_simanman</a>
 MSmits: considering as you spend a lot of time working on creating games, I have a suspicious feeling you like debugging their game more than your bot :P
 struct: well I just like the game to be bug free
 MSmits: same
 eulerscheZahl: we all do
 eulerscheZahl: except if i find a bug that no one else does and i can abuse it
 MSmits: haha like you can keep that to yourself
 eulerscheZahl: good point
 Smekarn: Then it's a feature, not a bug
 eulerscheZahl: never trust me with a secret, it will backfire
 struct: bugs, features whats the difference?
 struct: Also tbf its way easier to spot bugs when you have more than 100 people looking for them
 eulerscheZahl: i know, been there
 eulerscheZahl: 2 months of testing kutulu (intensely) and still some oversights
 eulerscheZahl: how was it even possible to get -1 cards to play?
 struct: thats what im afraid off
 struct:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: asking so that we don't patch a symptom without fixing the root cause
 MSmits: yeah, it should be easy to figure out though. Just check all references for plays left and find the lines where it is subtracted from
 struct: else if (player.getAction().isWait()) {
 struct: might be the cause
 struct: you play wait
 struct: then --
 struct: you get -1
 struct: or  this might be new?
 struct: Idk
 MSmits: set plays left becomes 0 though
 struct: But the phase doesnt change I thikn?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: you have the intellij view
 jacek: idea intellij
 struct: I think this is what happened you set to 0
 struct: then it still decrements --
 struct: because its still playCard turn
 MSmits: yeah has to be something like that
 struct: of phase
 struct: w/e
 jacek: imagine if java had unsigned types
 MSmits: how many places in the code does decrementing happen?
 struct: only here
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L143">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L143</a>
 MSmits: well then the bug must be there
 MSmits: thats the only place where removeoneplay is
 MSmits: but thats a function
 MSmits: you need to check where the variable playsleft is modified
 MSmits: it could be modified by a different function
 struct: it was modified on wait
 struct: to 0
 struct: then you check which phase it is
 struct: it is play phase
 struct: you decrement by 1
 struct: and plays because -1
 eulerscheZahl: ok, you convinced me
 struct: become*
 MSmits: hmm 
 MSmits:   if (activePlayer.getPlaysLeft() &lt;= 0) {
 MSmits: this makes it immediately 0 again?

 struct: its new
 MSmits: cool
 struct: it makes sense, if it was the root idk
 struct: and im too lazy to check
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642495725">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642495725</a>frame 38 is the bug with no play
 eulerscheZahl: and frame 30 he decides to WAIT instead of playing a card
 eulerscheZahl: that frame 30 causes frame 38 to fail
 struct:&#160;:)
 MSmits: my bot is now rank 25 =) It started automating cards
 struct: nice MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: so i agree with your findings struct, nice catch
 struct: still bruteforce?
 struct: Thanks
 MSmits: yeah, i just adjusted the eval to like automated cards
 MSmits: this is what is nice about simmed bots
 MSmits: you try to change the result not the actions
 eulerscheZahl: more easier to improve one thing without breaking everything else
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: it's harder to get your bot to do a specific thing using a sim, but maybe that specific thing is not the best thing to do anyways
 MSmits: Now to recode this entire bot in C# for a windows forms arena program
 MSmits: to fit params
 kovi: golden words
 eulerscheZahl: porting from C++ to C#? that's total madness. and it's what i like about you so much
 MSmits: :grin:
 struct: madness is the perfect word
 struct: MSmits you should check gui for c++ after the contest
 struct: There are some pretty easy to use
 MSmits: yeah i know, but thats not the only problem
 struct: Is it worth to report the root cause of the problem?
 MSmits: if I do something complex with C++ I am also going to have memory leaks and stuff
 MSmits: struct only if this could cause other problems
 MSmits: also struct, if you're interested, my bot is 1083 lines now and could still use some trimming. Should be able to get it below 1k
 eulerscheZahl: yes, gives him more confidence that your suggestion actually solves the problem
 MSmits: :P
 eulerscheZahl: "trying to solve" in a commit message on master isn't that convincing
 struct: ok
 struct: Nice, I'm still trying to get something working
 MSmits: still have another week struct
 [SG]Sebastien: I agree, it happens only after a WAIT (only way to get a negative value)
 [SG]Sebastien: nice catch struct
 struct: ok so I guess is not worth to report 
 struct: :p
 struct: thanks
 struct: Yeah MSmits I'm not too stressed about it
 [SG]Sebastien: the fix should be enough to prevent this from happening again. I'll check with CG when we can push it
 eulerscheZahl: pointing out the WAIT in the previous turn was me. I want recognition :D
 struct: I was gonna give you credit on the forum
 [SG]Sebastien: thanks also eulerscheZahl
 struct: As I did for MSmits
 MSmits: ah yes, team effort!!
 struct: Imagine figuring this without the chat
 eulerscheZahl: team:t for toadm for msmitsand struct gets the EA
 MSmits: there's no s in team
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: lots of hate for EA but i really liked command and conquer generals
 MSmits: me too
 eulerscheZahl: good times. before in-game purchases
 MSmits: yea&#160;:(
 MSmits: well.. i guess i stopped gaming before 
 Astrobytes: MTX has ruined gaming completely
 MSmits: except strategy games
 MSmits: mtx?
 struct: Different studios
 Astrobytes: microtransactions
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: diablo immortal :nauseated_face:
 MSmits: well, only for games with PTW model
 Astrobytes: jacek: yeah but it's still fun without paying
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care about visual upgrades that are pointless
 MSmits: I like paradox games. They have an abhorrent DLC policy, but are not PTW
 MSmits: pay to play still exists
 MSmits: you just pay a lot&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Diablo Imnmortal is soooo P2W it's unbelievable. The balance is screwed totally in favour of purchases
 struct: its p2w with lootboxes thats the worst part
 MSmits: I liked a game called stronghold kingdoms
 Astrobytes: yeah
 struct: before games were p2w, where you could buy items
 MSmits: but it is the worst P2W ever
 struct: now you buy lootboxes and have random chances
 MSmits: when a new server opened, some players spent over $1000 in 1 day
 Astrobytes: indeed struct
 struct: Then there are some lootboxes that show you 4 items and pretend that its 25% for each
 Astrobytes: MSmits: that's obscene
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: the whales
 Astrobytes: Aye
 struct: when in reality its like 90% for one and 10% for the others
 Astrobytes: or worse, yep
 MSmits: false advertising?
 Astrobytes: misleading
 struct: not false
 MSmits: sounds false
 MSmits: if they lie about probability
 Astrobytes: cleverly misleading, worked out by large legal teams no doubt
 struct: Some show the probability but if then they show 4 items on screen
 struct: it makes it seems like its 25% for each
 struct: its what I want to say
 struct: When in relaity its not
 MSmits: ohh ok
 struct: Many people dont know it I guess
 MSmits: if my job was in a legal team and this is what i was doing I'd feel like a complete loser
 struct: Its the same thing for slot machines, where people think the machine owes you money due to RTP (return to player)
 MSmits: with money obviously
 Astrobytes: Imagine being a dev in one of these studios. 
 struct: but thats not how slot machines work
 MSmits: RTP?
 MSmits: what does it do?
 MSmits: is this a button?
 Astrobytes: yeah, bang-on analogy
 struct: No, return to player is a&#160;%
 struct: so if you put 100€ you will get 96€ avg
 struct: if the rtp is 96%
 struct: But this is an illusion
 IvesL: i dont understand how can someone just promote from wood2 to wood1 then immediately to bronze, there are new rules
 struct: The rtp doesnt take into account how much money you spent
 eulerscheZahl: have you seen the show of hasan minhaj about game developers?
 struct: no
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLAi_cmly6Q&amp;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLAi_cmly6Q&amp;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke</a>
 struct: ill watch later
 struct: brb
 eulerscheZahl: 24min but i totally recommend watching
 Astrobytes: saved for later euler, thanks
 MSmits: it's good
 MSmits: i saw that already
 MSmits: i liked all his segments
 eulerscheZahl: some critical, some really funny
 Astrobytes: ah wait, I've seen part of this but didn't finish, good motivation to I guess
 eulerscheZahl: when he wants to talk to other players in-game and they just kill him
 MSmits: haha yea
 MSmits: didnt he criticize cricket and then his family hated him?
 MSmits: because you can't criticize cricket in India
 Astrobytes: lmao
 Astrobytes: that's a sacred sport in England and India :D
 MSmits: yep
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the video but didn't know about his family
 BrunoFelthes: 600 competidor at bronze at Sunday is not too many, isn't it?
 Astrobytes: not as big as the 'official' CG contests
 avdg: I still have to improve my bot
 avdg: which is rank 3 in wooe 1
 avdg: *wood
 Astrobytes: loads of time left avdg
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree players might be scared by the rules. but even a simpler game wouldn't come close to an official CG contest
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;50% of players in wood
 avdg: I'm 1 of the best wood players at the moment&#160;:-)
 avdg: my bot lacks lots of logic though
 MSmits: feels like an official contest to me
 MSmits: we even get cp for it
 Nerchio: i like it
 Astrobytes: cause the core players are mostly all here
 BrunoFelthes: this contest have prizes
 Nerchio: and nothing else matters
 BrunoFelthes: should be bigger
 Astrobytes: was it advertised via email?
 BrunoFelthes: yes Astrobytes
 BrunoFelthes: but 3 days before it starts
 MSmits: very sudden though
 Astrobytes: Also, it's not on the front page, or wasn't at least
 Astrobytes: ah I see, thanks BrunoFelthes
 jacek: nopony expected any more contests
 Astrobytes: well, Thibaud did say there was a sponsored one coming up during Spring Challenge (or around that time)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, sweet
 Astrobytes: this *is* that 'sponsored' one I think
 BrunoFelthes: i dont think that i will give legend this one.. i'm not started my simulator
 Astrobytes: Lots of time left Bruno
 BrunoFelthes: this simulator is very hard i think
 Astrobytes: Might be easier when the bugfixes are released 
 BrunoFelthes: bugfixes will be released?
 Astrobytes: there are a few pending on github awaiting CG approval to release yeah
 BrunoFelthes: where can i find?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/commits/master">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/commits/master</a>
 eulerscheZahl: as in: fixed in code but not deployed to CG servers
 Astrobytes: thanks euler
 Sheeesh---: guys any guide on how to make a good simulation&#160;?
 Astrobytes: the source code? :D
 Sheeesh---: or should i just wing it and see what i'm gonna make
 Sheeesh---: no
 Nerchio: that moment when your sim finds the winning move but the game skips card plays after training :rage:
 Sheeesh---: not for this agme
 Sheeesh---: game*
 Sheeesh---: cound be general
 Sheeesh---: like what makes a good simulation
 eulerscheZahl: just write some code that takes a state (your cards, opponent cards, applications, ...) and generates all possible actions and following states
 eulerscheZahl: that's not really complicated but tedious for a game like this
 eulerscheZahl: then write some scoring function. for beginners just the applications you completed, technical debt, maybe automated bonus
 eulerscheZahl: and print whatever sequence of actions (until RELEASE, inclusive) gives the highest score
 Sheeesh---: okay thank you
 eulerscheZahl: there isn't much more to say. the hard part comes when you tune the scoring or want to look into the next turn
 Sheeesh---: gonna go try it thanks for your help

 MichelLaviron: is it normal that if I play TRAINING while having ARCHITECTURE_STUDY in hand then the next possible moves are just releases / RANDOM / WAIT, but not playing the architecture card?
 kovi: known bug, already fixed, soon deployed
 kovi: (will be deployed soon)
 [SG]Sebastien: yeah, it happens if you did a WAIT in the previous turn's play card phase
 hotbrainy: hi
 hotbrainy: I am laburigor
 MichelLaviron: ok, thanks. Indeed I did that in the previous phase to be able to release instead
 hotbrainy: Good.
 hotbrainy: are you a student?
 MichelLaviron: no
 hotbrainy: why are you in codingame?
 hotbrainy: or are you a developer?
 MichelLaviron: because it's fun&#160;?
 hotbrainy: live:.cid.94aae67563a833a3
 hotbrainy: my skype.
 Astrobytes: stop that hotbrainy
 hotbrainy: oh sorry.
 Braltz: Hi guys, I've been trying this platform to have some fun with my friends and it's amazing. I have a question, is there a way to create a private clash and start another round again when everyone finished a problem?
 Westicles: you just have to send them a new link every time
 Braltz: Thanks for asking. And the questions are completly random right? or there's a way to select a specific topic or diffiulty
 jacek: you can only set mode and language. there is no difficulty
 eulerscheZahl: "thanks for asking"? you are the one who asked
 Braltz: I mean, answer 
 eulerscheZahl: not completely random. it tries to select a question that none of the participants played before
 eulerscheZahl: from a pool of around 2000 clashes
 Braltz: I see, thanks for the info
 Illedan: Where do you get Technical cards when passing the admin desk?Played cards? Hand? Discard pile?
 Illedan: Same with GIVE
 kovi: given card arrives together with drawn at move
 kovi: the order after movethrow-&gt;give-&gt;move-take-card
 Illedan: The Debt cards too?
 Illedan: Hmm, might not be an issue. As this only occurs if you have nothing to play. And then you don't have to worry about those cards getting reshuffled by a training
 kovi: good point
 Illedan: Oh, collision with the other player gives 2 debt cards :O thought it was 1
 Scarfield: only if you dont have a skill card to give away?
 Illedan: yeah
 Scarfield: good good, thought i misread it for a sec&#160;:)
 jacek: euler alt? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/57640b35c62eceea153b5e0c688230477630382">https://www.codingame.com/profile/57640b35c62eceea153b5e0c688230477630382</a>
 Scarfield: "If they do not have any skill card in hand, they get 2 Technical Debt cards." the "they get part confused me, thought you could give your opponent debt cards at first
 kovi: nope. daiver is a longtime topcoder sometimes playing here as well
 rcrl: Hello everyone, does anybody already had an issue when releasing a releasable app&#160;?
 avdg: I wish they had more images explaining the actions&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: also noticed sullyper from TC
 kovi: oh well, and finally a game which proves that coding can also be influenced by the "training bug"
 kovi: or maybe not? (i did draw another coding but both draw/discard piles are empty)
 Nerchio: if I don't have anything in the discard the input is skipped?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: like hand etc. as well
 Nerchio: :rage:
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 Nerchio: how can hand be skipped jacek
 Nerchio: its not just discard and draw?
 jacek: maybe not hand, but any pile thats is empty is skipped
 Illedan: Saving storage and coding green since 2022
 COOMERS: How do I do custom text cases within a challenge
 COOMERS:&#160;?
 Scarfield: "APPLICATION"
 eulerscheZahl: oh indeed, sullype r is playing
 eulerscheZahl: psyh o as well
 RioTheDev: hello
 Astrobytes: ah, didn't notice psyh o
 jacek: psyho?
 Astrobytes: thank you jacek, that will be all
 eulerscheZahl: you pinged him
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:Psyho">https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:Psyho</a>
 jacek: didnt you mean psycho?
 Astrobytes: no
 eulerscheZahl: maybe that name was taken?
 Scarfield: price money $87500 :o
 Psyho: it's few times larger&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Scarfield: damn
 eulerscheZahl: that's only the prize money for on-site finals
 Westicles: and now add a Nokia 3310
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: almost there <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/S2o8T9H.png">https://i.imgur.com/S2o8T9H.png</a>
 Scarfield: how many people can make a living from competetive programming, i believe tour ist is one?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: xD
 tobk: Was there a simple way to swap 1st and 2nd player? Would be nice for testing given the vast differences whether you are 1st or 2nd (or is that just me?)
 eulerscheZahl: google: cg enhancer
 eulerscheZahl: adds some more bells and whistles too
 Scarfield: cow bells?
 Astrobytes: ^ you might need to edit the js to use only the parts you need, it can be a memory hog
 tobk: Right, you recommended that some contests back already. Was too lazy to really look into it TBH...&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: shame on you
 eulerscheZahl: may your cube stickers peel off
 tobk: :scream:
 Astrobytes: LOL
 Scarfield: oof
 avdg: the peel
 Astrobytes: definitely in my top 5 insults of the year so far 
 Lassassin: Hi
 Lassassin: im playing the pod game thing
 eulerscheZahl: yay!
 Lassassin: im better than boss but its not promoting me from wood to bronze
 MSmits: lol
 avdg: is the submit done recently?
 Lassassin: yes
 avdg: if so, you have to await the matching
 jacek: it says theres still 50% more games to play
 jacek: you need to wait to finish
 Lassassin: ok
 Lassassin: it says battle 65%
 Lassassin: im rank 1
 Lassassin: still in wood 1 league&#160;:()
 Lassassin:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: 6% &lt; 100%
 jacek: wait till 100%
 eulerscheZahl: 65*
 Lassassin: oh mb i thought 50% is enough
 Lassassin: this platform is pretty fun lol
 Lassassin: wohoO
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Lassassin: :tada:
 jacek: spoiler alert: -3vel
 MSmits: :scream:
 Scarfield: oh psy ho streams
 Astrobytes: I only stream tears :D
 MSmits: how goes it with the bot Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: haven't worked on the sim version today, just messing around with heuristic stuff today and back to real bot tomorrow
 jacek: have you tried -3vel
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: hopefully bugfixes will be released tomorrow too
 MSmits: I have problems concentrating on coding on work days
 MSmits: so i went nuts this weekend trying to finish sim
 MSmits: that way i can do light stuff during the week like fitting parms
 jacek: i havent unlocked my full potential knowing there are still bugs in the game
 Astrobytes: fair MSmits
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 MSmits: this week is my last real teaching week before the summer too. We got test week and activities and such, but normal classes will be over
 Scarfield: unfortunate timing
 struct: Just make the students play the game
 Astrobytes: yeah, typical!
 struct: and give you strategies for it
 Astrobytes: struct :D
 MSmits: haha
 Scarfield: are there prizes for this contest?
 MSmits: dont think i have a student interested enough to do this this year
 MSmits: 3 phones
 MSmits: did I mention I have never owned a smartphone
 Astrobytes: aw damn, that sucks
 Astrobytes: and yes
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am waiting till i win one
 Astrobytes: if you win, just sell it
 MSmits: that works too
 struct: ill trade you a CG shirt for it
 struct: oh wait
 MSmits: The IT team of my school was trying to get me to use a phone as 2-factor authentication, so i almost got locked out of all systems
 MSmits: but i found a way to use google authenticator app
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 MSmits: they didnt know that existed
 Astrobytes: 2FA can be done just via text though, don't need a smartphone for that
 jacek: ok boomer
 MSmits: yeah you can check the QR code as well and get the adress right?
 Astrobytes: oh lol
 MSmits: i never knew this.
 MSmits: I have been calling companies that wanted me to use the QR code and when i said i had no phone, they told me i could just not use their website then
 Astrobytes: ffs
 Westicles: the best thing about a smart phone is remoting into your pc to check your program
 Astrobytes: world has its priorities upside down I tell ya
 MSmits: I like to just use a small laptop
 struct: MSmits you can use your smartphone to make the oware book
 MSmits: in addition to a good PC
 Daporan: smartphones seem useful for locating yourself and/or getting a taxi if you get lost
 Astrobytes: hah
 Astrobytes: that's about it
 MSmits: yeah i agree they can be very useful Daporan, but i only go somewhere i havent been, once or twice a year
 struct: There goes your chance to win 1 of the smartphones MSmits
 Astrobytes: also hi Daporan o/
 MSmits: lol struct
 MSmits: and hi dapo
 Daporan: hi
 Astrobytes: Playing? :grin:
 Daporan: that's an open conjecture
 Astrobytes: fair
 MSmits: if you need more info to decide. It's a reasonably fun game, but a very wordy and confusing statement
 Astrobytes: at least the code doesn't lie
 struct: and a few bugs that the next version should fix
 Lassassin: any tricks on how i can use collision to my advantage
 Lassassin:&#160;?
 struct: Lassassin dont worry about collisions until legend
 MSmits: tbh if this had been magic the gathering themed with 8 colors for mana and each color having a special ability, i would have understood it much faster
 struct: Lassassin try to store the checkpoints in an array
 Astrobytes: *plus a correct statement MSmits
 Glyptod0n: just so i'm understanding the game correctly, the player that goes second is kinda at disadvantage when it comes to having to give cards away right? because in the game i'm looking at, it's just me giving away cards to opponent the whole time lol
 MSmits: well that too
 struct: after the first lap is completed you can start aiming to the next checkpoint
 struct: once you are close enough to the current
 MSmits: Glyptod0n not necessarily, just the first turn. You can jump over him and he will have to jump over you next or give you cards
 MSmits: two plays can keep froghopping over eachother and rack up lots of admin losses
 MSmits: players
 Glyptod0n: ah okay, thanks for the hint
 struct: The next patch should fix the creation of bonus cards right?
 Lassassin: so basically when i come closer to the current checkpoint, i instantly target the next
 Lassassin:&#160;?
 struct: It should work yes
 Lassassin: i see, lemme give it a try
 Astrobytes: yes, it helps to take into account your velocity too
 Lassassin: i think if i could just draw a line of the lap and idk, it sounds better in my head but idk how to implement it
 Lassassin: weird
 jacek: its simple logic - target far straight ahead? thrust 100 or boost. closer? smaller thrust
 Lassassin: hehe not that simple
 Lassassin: :3
 Lassassin: or maybe it is and im just bad
 struct: There is any easy way to get gold
 struct: not sure if you want it or not
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 Lassassin: how to get harder clash of code problems?
 jacek: you cant. they are random
 Astrobytes: pretend Mad Pod Racing is a clash [solved]
 Lassassin: ohno
 Astrobytes: jacek fix your responses
 jacek: thats what she said?
 Scarfield: ohno?
 Astrobytes: that'll suffice I guess
 Westicles: Lassassin, approve this for harder clashes
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/18429f2b452ae7ee8e44b2ecf12e69e8f3960">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/18429f2b452ae7ee8e44b2ecf12e69e8f3960</a>
 jacek: youd need 100 (300?) clashes to approve
 bobth: 50
 bobth: i think
 jacek: threshold is so slow
 jacek: low even
 bobth: yeah
 bobth: and just the number you played, not whether or not you played well
 Illedan: Seems decent Westicles, but might be hard for most people
 Westicles: the python crowd doesn't seem to like 2D grids
 MSmits: not without numpy
 bobth: I like it lol
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Can someone help me out with what does -f means in bash
 Astrobytes: lol, not wrong MSmits
 Manchi_o6o7: for example in an if statement [ -f $something ]
 Astrobytes: looks fine Westicles, I'd try it as an easy puzzle since it failed at clash
 MSmits: I made it to top 10!
 MSmits: well...10 tbh&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: gratz MSmits!
 MSmits: thanks, just been fiddling with params
 Astrobytes: figured that&#160;:)
 jacek: opening book eh
 MSmits: no book
 Illedan: Nice MSmits
 Illedan: I have no idea why I'm still here
 struct: grats
 MSmits: where?
 Astrobytes: here
 Illedan: 8th :P
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: because your bot is good?
 Astrobytes: there
 Illedan: No?
 struct: My bot just doesnt work because of referee bugs /as
 struct:  /s*
 Illedan:  else if(moves.Any(m =&gt; m.Contains("CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION") &amp;&amp; !m.Contains("CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATkION 5"))){
 Illedan: This is one of my IFS
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: that's.... very specific :D
 MSmits: at least you thought about what would be good moves
 MSmits: I still haven't used any strategy behind some common sense params
 MSmits: except some params i mean
 MSmits: (tired)
 MSmits: nothing hardcoded
 MSmits: I still need to spend time thinking about this game to know what to eval
 Illedan: At least I have some base logic to encode into my sim when it's done
 MSmits: yeah
 Illedan: As it seems to work
 MSmits: works fine
 Astrobytes: indeed
 MSmits: btw, my version at rank 10 had a 55% WR compared to my version at rank 22
 MSmits: relatively small change. Fairly random ladder I think
 struct: well 10 and 22 is close
 MSmits: not sure if it's rock paper scissors effects, or the fact that the game has a lot of random
 MSmits: almost 2 rating points
 Astrobytes: significant
 MSmits: how do rating points convert to WR?
 Inc_: This was probably asked before, butin the Green Circle contest, how do you know how many skill cards are in the desks (in Wood league)?
 MSmits: total - everything else
 MSmits: desk -&gt; total = 5
 Inc_: okay, a bit of calculation. thanks!
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: they should probably have given it as input
 Astrobytes: lets not start on the "should haves" for this one :D
 MSmits: heh right
 MSmits: so far I am liking this contest
 Astrobytes: I don't dislike it
 Astrobytes: that's high praise from me
 MSmits: probably would not be good if it was a month long, like locam was
 Astrobytes: ugh. Well, they might have fixed all the bugs my then! /s
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: anyways, I am getting some sleep. Work tomorrow. Gn!
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: It's a little bit different to the norm, this game. kinda what I like about it
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits
 jacek: :older_man:
 Astrobytes: ^ relatively accurate but too old looking
 Paroni: out of curiosity, what does it mean when an opponent gives different results when "replayed in same conditions"? why does it benefit them to induce randomness?
 Astrobytes: did you remember to set to 'manual'?
 jacek: so they cant counter book youu
 Paroni: i didnt think setting to manual was generally necessary when battling the same opponent without changing my own code? all other opponents have always given the same result. And is it really only for preventing counters? :D
 jacek: it depends. if they use search, it number of iterations per turn may affect the outcome
 Astrobytes: it sets the game seed to whatever it was in the game, should help with randomness unless the player is using a dynamic seed in their random or a search issue as jacek described
 Paroni: thanks. I should maybe some day learn how to do a search and stop it before it times out...
 Astrobytes: you definitely should, all things in due course&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: jacek: you seem unusually interested in this contest
 Astrobytes: (unusually for you I mean)
 jacek: huh
 Astrobytes: you don't generally bother about the game much past a couple of days in
 struct: jacek is just looking for bugs
 Astrobytes: troll material eh
 Westicles: theres a nice puzzle (wine from kalbodia 2) about to expire the 2nd time with 2 approvals if anybody is bored
 struct: finally managed to work out a logic that will work for the move
 struct: ...
 avdg: Still not in bronze but I guess I should only optimize my bot now (apart from the new rules in bronze)
 jacek: until next bug
 struct: optimize? do you mean improve?
 avdg: my rust bot didn't crash yet&#160;:-)
 avdg: and it compiles
 avdg: and yeah, I have to make it smarter
 avdg: my ai with random moves was still performing better though
 Westicles: made my monkeypox clash into an easy puzzle, seems it also was too hard for a clash
 Westicles: also
 Astrobytes: no clash is too easy but clashes can be too hard. Gotta love that
 Illedan: Wow
 Illedan: That last bug reported on the forum :D
 Illedan: #Ez life
 struct: lol
 struct: yeah
 struct: just saw
 struct: seems like a massive bug
 Illedan: oh yeah
 jacek: hm?
 Illedan: rofl
 Illedan: Check the forum
 Astrobytes: hahaha omg
 Illedan: Soo, where do we wanna stay to crush everyone for the night?
 Illedan: xD
 jacek: oh my
 struct: achitecture Illedan
 struct: Then you can take other cards
 struct: its over
 Illedan: I did crash
 Illedan: hmm
 struct: let me try
 Illedan: Might need 1 of 2 first
 Illedan: yeah
 struct: I need 1 daily routine 1st?
 Illedan: yes
 struct: seems simple enough
 Westicles: someone is gonna hide with a bug and win it all
 jacek: i like cats
 Astrobytes: I presume Karang had no luck with the int cracking
 Astrobytes: *random int
 struct: I was going to sleep, with this new discovery I can't
 struct: oh well
 avdg: bye bye sleep
 avdg: but I'm going&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: always an excuse to stay up struct :D
 struct: gn avdg
 avdg: gn
 Astrobytes: gn avdg
 struct: This one should be trivial to fix though
 Astrobytes: yeah. It's a fun one though
 struct: Its a bit of a strange one though
 Astrobytes: does it work with the fixed version on github? I haven't downloaded that yet
 struct: not sure
 SandmanSW96: Since NOBODY bothers to read feedback here lol:

 SandmanSW96: cl-ass
 Astrobytes: SandmanSW96: some of us do, and I understand your frustration, fwiw
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: can't see the approval system getting better any time soon though 
 struct: oh well
 struct: Every1 can get frustrated it happens
 struct: ill let it slide
 Westicles: the only change they ever needed was to hide author's code and require you to solve it before approving
 Astrobytes: ^ this allllll day
 Astrobytes: I would also like a 'verified understandable translation' thing
 struct: That one might be harder
 Astrobytes: Not really. They want things in English? Plenty speakers to verify. They want it in French? Likewise.
 Astrobytes: *native speakers
 emh: if someone keeps jumping 2 steps ahead of you then you should decide where you want to go and jump 4 steps before it. ez
 struct: Im only taking so long on backgammon because I'm writing the statement in french
 Astrobytes: struct :rofl:
 Astrobytes: emh: is the house guest behaving
 struct: There is even a better way emh
 emh: Astrobytes yes she is taking a shower
 Astrobytes: cool&#160;:)
 emh: struct how?
 struct: There is a way to never meet the admin team emh
 jacek: how much did it cost
 struct: Check forum
 emh: really?
 struct: It will be patched but use it I guess
 struct: It's a funny bug
 Astrobytes: yeah it's an amusing one
 struct: Good thing someone found it
 jacek: unit tests are not green
 struct: and even more important reported it
 struct: This bug could win the game alone
 struct: If it was done by a top player on last submit
 Astrobytes: restores a fraction of my faith in humanity
 jacek: there goes my plan :rage:
 struct: "top player"
 jacek: top with the bug
 struct: You are right though
 struct: probably any bot on top 20 could win with this bug
 Westicles: SG is an investment bank, they want sneaky people 
 struct: What if they are recruiting bug hunters for the company?
 struct: and this is all a test
 Astrobytes: lol struct, Westicles
 emh: struct is it like MOVE 2 2?
 struct: but you need to have daily routine
 struct: after that MOVE 2 3 might work
 struct: i have tried it
 struct: havent*
 Astrobytes: don't you need 2 daily routines?
 struct: oh yes
 Astrobytes: well, 2+
 struct: I was gonna try it
 struct: But I would have to rush some stuff and I dont feel like it
 Astrobytes: the starter bot is alright for testing things
 Astrobytes: don't need to mess up your proper bot
 struct: yeah
 Inc_: is the card location "PLAYED_CARDS" missing in the inputs?
 struct: you only get it if you played cards
 struct: on previous output
 struct: and if the phase is play card
 Astrobytes: no it's there, what struct said&#160;:)
 mlomb: also in release phase
 struct: oh ok
 Inc_: "the cards you played during this turn *and that will go to your discard pile at the end of your turn*"
 struct: It does
 struct: You have AUTOMATED
 Inc_: Wood 1
 struct: ah wait
 struct: not there
 struct: it gives in player inputs
 struct: the architecture
 Inc_: so, I gotta get to the next league? :D
 struct: no
 struct: ah but maybe you dont have this skill there
 Inc_: thx anyways
 struct: ARCHITECTURE_STUDY (4). This is a permanent skill: once played, it stays active until the team has released one application.The team will draw one more card at the beginning of their turn. If you play many cards, their effects will add up.
 struct: This is what architecture does
 struct: and its given on permanentArchitectureStudyCards
 Inc_: sure, but not how many are currently active
 Inc_: ah, I see
 struct: you get it when reading the player position, score and such
 Inc_: thats confusing
 struct: well the card will stay in your deck
 struct: it will just increase your cards drawn
 struct: Might be a bit confusing yeah 
 Astrobytes: lets focus on the non-confusing parts of the game.e.g. There are cards
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: oh sounds easy
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 struct: Good thing I didnt test for this contest
 struct: I would not find a single bug
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: seriously though, I have no idea why they stopped the user testing
 struct: well the last one was SC21
 struct: the other one didnt really need testing
 struct: since it was a reuse
 Astrobytes: It would have benefited from it
 struct: Maybe they are worried about leaks
 struct: or bots being too strong at day 1
 struct: My bot for SC21 was almost 24 hours at the top but my last version has 100% win rate vs it
 struct: so idk
 Astrobytes: meh, the tester bots are too strong thing is a fallacy
 struct: you dont have anyone to test against
 Astrobytes: exactly
 struct: You do since there are more testers
 Astrobytes: well yeah, but that's a very small sample size
 struct: But im not gonna try hard on testing
 struct: Its not the goal
 struct: I did go bitboards on it
 Astrobytes: exactly, it's finding bugs
 struct: but thats because the game asked for it
 struct: and im not gonna play an hex game without it
 Astrobytes: "the game asked for it" is a fantastic statement
 struct: lol
 struct: and I was happy to see that it was a game that I previously thought of porting
 struct: I think its one of the best games on CG
 Astrobytes: the photosynthesis one?
 Astrobytes: Fair I guess, I wasn't overly amazed by it but it was decent
 struct: Its intuitive
 struct: You can tell if your bot is doing well or not
 struct: Cant say the same about many
 Astrobytes: Alright yeah, in that respect you're right
 struct: emh did the bug work?
 struct: or you did not test it?
 emh: I'm trying
 struct: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: to exploit it properly it needs some cleverness
 emh: yeah seems to be working
 Astrobytes: nice 
 struct: does it only work with 2 2
 struct:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: no it seems to work with any desk as long as the card number matches, only local test not submit
 Astrobytes: don't take my word for that though
 Healer1064: Hello, Friends!!!
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: o/
 Healer1064: Hi
 Healer1064: Happy holiday!
 Troph: Hi all
 Astrobytes: salut Troph
 Troph: I'm surprised some people are still awake
 Astrobytes: LOL I just said that to Blaise in fr :D
 Astrobytes: well, similar
 Troph: I kind of cheat I'm in GMT-4
 Astrobytes: Troph: Caribbean?
 struct: bad timezone for last day though
 Troph: Astrobytes exactly
 Troph: struct why so&#160;?
 struct: if you want to submit at the end
 Astrobytes: putain, lucky bastard :D
 struct: its like 4 am for you
 struct: unless you are not playing the contest
 Troph: I am currently unemployed so I wouldn't mind
 Astrobytes: I feel that
 Troph: besides, I don't think a last minute submit would change anything for me, I plan on making it to gold, legend top
 struct: yeah similar to me
 struct: My last day submit achieve nothing
 Astrobytes: well.... worked last contest no?
 struct: I cant even remember
 struct: When I made it to legend
 struct: if it was last day
 struct: or not
 Astrobytes: it was
 struct: oh, then I guess it worked lol
 struct: But I hope I don't have to do it again
 Troph: the last spring challenge&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Troph: Is it possible to reach legend without any sort of simulation&#160;?
 Astrobytes: if you can tune your heuristics well enough I don't see why not, bit early to say
 Astrobytes: Though single turn bruteforce is doable so that might mitigate that
 BrunoFelthes: I'm not using simulation, and I'm top 10 now...
 Troph: hmm, I thought of a single turn brute force but I did not see how it could work, since there are multiple phases in a turn
 BrunoFelthes: but I'm think that it will be very hard to reach legend without search
 Troph: BrunoFelthes can I ask what are you using&#160;?
 Astrobytes: BrunoFelthes: I suspect so too
 BrunoFelthes: 1000 lines of if/else
 Troph: oO
 Astrobytes: also, congrats on top 10&#160;:)
 Troph: you must have a really good understanding of the game
 struct: 1k lines of if else o.o
 struct: I dont know how to make bots like that
 Astrobytes: Troph: regarding the phases, you can bruteforce the possible randoms too
 BrunoFelthes: it is java, it is very verbose..
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: my code is very verbose as well
 Astrobytes: spaghetti if code is the worst
 BrunoFelthes: i have a function to each game phase
 BrunoFelthes: Move phase with 500 lines of code...
 Astrobytes: yeah, best way to keep it semi-organised I guess :D
 struct: move is the hardest
 Astrobytes: I'm still not sure I fully understand all the repercussions of move
 Astrobytes: I guess I will find out tomorrow
 struct: well move can make you throw cards, followed by giving cards
 Astrobytes: tomorrow == today  I mean
 Troph: what do you mean repercussion of move&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah exactly struct
 Astrobytes: Troph: what struct said
 Astrobytes: in different situations this can get a bit confusing
 Troph: and very punishing
 BrunoFelthes: yeah, and at legend, I think that move will need to consider the opponent block, i do not look to the opponent
 Astrobytes: yes indeed Troph
 Astrobytes: BrunoFelthes: I'm not sure on that yet, time will tell I guess
 Troph: what...top ten and you do not look where the opponent is&#160;? oh my...
 BrunoFelthes: no, i do not try to block opponent moves
 Troph: that's impressive to say the least
 Astrobytes: well there's a minimal amount of interaction
 Troph: ah
 BrunoFelthes: i think that maybe, the best start will be at 4, not at 5
 struct: wouldnt the best start be 1?
 struct: ah no
 BrunoFelthes: top players are starting at 5
 struct: it wont work
 Troph: I have the impression that top player start by farming 5
 emh: I've submitted with bug exploit, but you're right, it does seem like some cleverness is needed
 emh: resting at CI and automating bonuses is too slow
 emh: for some players
 emh: bonus until 8
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's not overly beneficial. Anyway, don't put too much thought into it as it most likely will be fixed :D
 Troph: until 8&#160;? that seems a bit overkill
 Troph: what will be fixed&#160;?
 struct: you dont have to pass through admin
 Troph: :o
 Troph: how&#160;?
 Astrobytes: check the forum thread :sunglasses:
 Troph: will it be fixed before or after silver
 Astrobytes: yes
 Astrobytes: :P
 Troph: :unamused:
 Troph: will it be fixed before silver&#160;?
 Troph: :p
 Astrobytes: no idea, not sure if they picked it up yet tbh, was later today when it was found, still a load of fixes ready to be released
 Troph: I should have rephrased with "Will it be fixed before XOR after silver".I'm keeping that one in mind for next time
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: love it.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, gonna get some rest.
 Astrobytes: bnbn 
 Troph: gn
 Astrobytes: (one choco)
 Troph: (you owe me royalties on that one)
 Astrobytes: :D

 emh: gn
 Alexander-Zierhut: those profile pictures are so obviously bots, some of them xD
 struct: Where?
 struct: clash of code?
 Troph: which one&#160;?
 Alexander-Zierhut: I like that they fill players but those are obvious sometime xD

 Troph: in clash of code&#160;?
 bobth: Alexander-Zierhut uh
 bobth: that guy is not a but
 bobth: bot*
 antiwonto: [auto] 'bot' was defined as ' Automaton2000 '
 Automaton2000: let's wait for the next checkpoint
 Troph: oh Automaton2000 is here too&#160;!
 Automaton2000: what are you struggling with?
 Troph: life&#160;:(
 Inc_: Response time per turn ≤ 50ms (Doing Green IT means sparing resources)
 struct: you cant go lower than 50ms on the sdk
 Alexander-Zierhut: @bobth it's all fun and games.
 Inc_: I like the addition about green IT
 Alexander-Zierhut: Sure, huge field here in GER
 Troph: Did I miss something or "green it" is just "good practices"
 Glyptod0n: i'm not understanding what playing DAILY_ROUNTINE card do, "the team can get their new skill card from a desk one step away", how is the team "getting" the skill card one desk over? I played that card, but i'm still getting the card of the desk i'm at, and if the desk has no more card, it still just gives me BONUS card 
 struct: Glyptod0n its a permanent skill until you release an app
 struct: which makes you choose a card at distance DAILY_ROUTINE
 struct: when you move
 struct: permanentDailyRoutineCards
 struct: thats the var
 Troph: I think he asks how to get the card for another desk
 struct: MOVE 4 5
 struct: for example
 Troph: from*
 BrunoFelthes: at the next move
 struct: that card only has affects on the following turns
 Glyptod0n: oh got it, thank you very much; yea I didn't notice the MOVE [desk1] [desk2] after playing ROUTINE card
 Glyptod0n: thanks!
 struct: np
 BrunoFelthes: cgstats is not with this contest?

 BrunoFelthes: ty
 struct: np
 struct: almost 400 lines to the apply move function
 emh: seems like I wasted the last 7 hours on deteriorating code. my 7 hour old submit is still much better.. well well I guess I'll try to backport the changes one by one
 Troph: I admire that you guys can find pattern and strategies without actually playing the game
 struct: emh no version control?
 emh: nahh I use the CG history
 struct: o.o
 struct: ah I forgot you use cg ide
 <b>**Troph is also guilty of this</b></p><p><img src="/a/8880348453118" /> emh: I changed to VS Code
 emh: github copilot is so nice
 emh: autocomplete
 emh: I have done git init in the folder, but no commits haha
 struct: ok i wrote the entire move play without testing
 struct: lets see how many bugs I have lol
 struct: I use git but I only commit
 struct: I never revert changes
 emh: ok me too usually
 emh: but now I should sleep
 emh: 7th still
 struct: me too
 struct: But a few more minutes for me
 struct: I think I found another bug?
 struct: Can someone check frame 4 to 5
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/643075790">https://www.codingame.com/replay/643075790</a>
 struct: I should lose 2 bonus cards right?
 struct: 2 get added to the mid pile
 struct: but only 1 gets removed from my hand
 jujurocking: It's a known bug 
 struct: ok, just wanted to make sure
 struct: thanks
 jujurocking: If you have only one type of card the game remove only one copy
 struct: ah
 jujurocking: I think it should be fixed with the next update
 struct: thanks again
 jujurocking: np
 Westicles: wait, tomorrow is a holiday?
 struct: where?
 Westicles: good 'ol USA
 Westicles: stock market is closed and everything.  never heard of this holiday before
 struct: Whats the holiday for?
 Westicles: I don't know
 struct: Juneteenth 
 Westicles: must be some twitter thing
 struct: I think its the date that marks the end of slavery
 yhyoxx: any tips for this contest&#160;?
 yhyoxx: did it really end ..?
 struct: yhyoxx im just gonna run a  sim and bruteforce depth 1 and eval
 struct: There are people at the top with ifs
 struct: lots of them
 yhyoxx: since the cards have effects u can use ifs yea
 yhyoxx: wont it be hard to write the sim&#160;?
 yhyoxx: it's almost rewriting the game right&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: it was painful 
 struct: let me check how many lines of codes I have now
 struct: 1 sec
 struct: 1520
 yhyoxx: and after that u get real good understanding of how everything works
 yhyoxx: that's a lot of lines
 struct: Well now I know the rules
 yhyoxx: worth it
 struct: I havent submited yet because I just finished the sim 
 struct: It seems to be working?
 yhyoxx: u got this 
 struct: at least it doesnt crash and I have asserts everywhere
 yhyoxx: struct rank 1
 struct: lol
 struct: Ill be happy with legend
 yhyoxx: me too ;_;
 yhyoxx: or gold 
 Westicles: my goal is silver without reading anything
 yhyoxx: without ever reading what u type 
 yhyoxx: that's a challenge
 yhyoxx: struct how is depth 1 search gonna be useful&#160;?
 struct: by depth 1 I mean until release phase / wait
 struct: so not just 1 move
 yhyoxx: i see
 struct: I don't  recommend sim if you don't have experience with them
 struct: This game is a bit complicated to sim imo
 yhyoxx: thought so
 yhyoxx: ill try to understand the game better first
 yhyoxx: hand, draw pile and discard pile are confusing me 
 struct: there is even one more pile now
 struct: played
 struct: so played cards go into played pile
 struct: when your turn ends (after release or wait)
 struct: they go into the discard pile
 struct: all your cards in hand will also go into the discard pile
 struct: When your draw pile is empty, the discard pile will go into the draw pile
 The_Duck: man I implemented simming TRAINING and the first time my bot tries to use it it hits the you-don't-get-a-second-play bug. what an anticlimax
 struct: The_Duck yeah easy to create bugs here
 struct: The Move phase is pretty hard imo
 The_Duck: I mean, my code worked AFAICT, but I hit the referee bug
 struct: ah
 struct: There are plenty
 struct: It should be fixed tomorrow most of them
 struct: There is one that hasnt been fixed yet on git repo
 The_Duck: what  is it?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/contest-green-circle/196455/72">https://forum.codingame.com/t/contest-green-circle/196455/72</a>
 struct: you can avoid going into admin with it
 The_Duck: oh haha
 j4at: good job struct&#160;:) You actually finished the sim :oI gave up after finding out that I had bugs in my Search race sim although I read the referee!!!I was half way done but I'm pretty sure that It will be full of bugs, because its always is! so I decided to give up.
 struct: Thanks, what bug did you have on the referee?
 NAbeeel: whatsup 
 antiwonto: [auto] 'up' was defined as ' a direction, specifically the direction away from the center of earth, opposite to down '
 NAbeeel: i h8 u
 j4at: Didn't even test my green circle one. I decided to give up because I know that I always make bugs. In search race I don't remember :3
 struct: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".

 struct: Frame 29
 struct: I train
 struct: but dont get cards?
 struct: On blue player
 The_Duck: do you definitely train?
 struct: ah
 struct: I drew 2 tech
 struct: thats why it skipped the turn
 struct: the viewer makes it seems like I didnt
 struct: But my discard pile was 3 tech debt before training
 struct: and it becomes 8 after
 struct: so I guess thats why
 The_Duck: oh
 The_Duck: I find this viewer quite confusing
 struct: It is
 struct: They should have added intermediate frames
 struct: but its too late now
 struct: imo
 struct: It takes a bit of work to do that
 struct: But I think the game is still fun
 struct: Anyways I'm out for the night, gn everyone

 Pathfinderboy: Hola!
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: why this is not working
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: if n == 38: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99fc3d1a-621c-4f2e-922e-f2ce8ee436c8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99fc3d1a-621c-4f2e-922e-f2ce8ee436c8</a>
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: on the death first search op 1
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: ep
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: the last print
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: triple star
 VizGhar: I dont understand the question is, but I'm pretty sure, your solution is just hardcoded something
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: oh ok
 VizGhar: IT will print three stars? you say?
 VizGhar: there is just no way that code prints three stars
 Nat-42: VizGhar I think that's the name of the failing test case
 VizGhar: ah :D
 VizGhar: XueHuaPiaoPiao you cant simply hardcode solution for given test cases. It wont automatically work for validators. I know you can see validators after submit, and hardcode your solution, but there is no joy in such programming
 VizGhar: (you can see validators for this particullar puzzle not for many more)
 Nat-42: XueHuaPioaPioa I think you are meant to use a 'depth first search' algorithm on the node graph, and find all paths connecting an enemy to an exit, and then severe a node on the shortest path
 Nat-42: seemed like a pretty difficult problem to me?
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: ok

 ToKraTheGreat: How, how can I create coding challenge only for my friends?
 5DN1L: what do you mean by coding challenges? do you mean clash of code or something else?
 ToKraTheGreat: Wow, yeah. I think I found it. It is "Clash of Code"
 5DN1L: you can start a private clash, there's a button for that there
 ToKraTheGreat: Yep, thx
 linjoehan: how about a wordle optimum puxxle?

 Cryptical: How I join a group
 Cryptical: How do I join a group?
 abt8601: What group? I haven't heard of this feature before
 Darleanow: hello guys, i have a problem in temperatures, my code is working, but when there's -5 and 5 for example, it sends -5 even though i want 5
 Darleanow: how can i do it&#160;?
 Darleanow: heres the code
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/63a9b2e0-c6aa-4ab4-8a6f-577c7496ff5d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/63a9b2e0-c6aa-4ab4-8a6f-577c7496ff5d</a>
 Yolwoocle2: you're checking for the minimum
 Darleanow: indeed
 Darleanow: but i want to make sure that, if theres the same value but one is negative, to print it instead of the negative one
 abt8601: You can use key=lambda x: (abs(x), -x)
 abt8601: So that when two numbers are equal in absolute value you get the positive one as the minimum
 Darleanow: can you explain the formula pls&#160;?
 Darleanow: i'm not good at maths xà
 Darleanow: x)
 5DN1L: abt8601 let's not teach Darleanow to use lambda for now
 5DN1L: simple ifs first :wink:
 5DN1L: he can learn lambda later
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 Darleanow: mean &gt;:(
 5DN1L: then it depends on whether you want to use absolute value or not
 5DN1L: we can do without abs() even
 5DN1L: but abs() will make life easier
 Darleanow: yeah, to take the min value i used abs, but it made my code not working properly
 5DN1L: that's not mean, i just worry that it confuses you more
 Darleanow: im on geeks for geeks to understand of lambda functions
 5DN1L: if you're up to the challenge, perfectly fine for you to learn it too
 Darleanow: i want to learn python, so i'll take everything i can learn from it&#160;!!
 Darleanow: i'm sure i'll need it for the next puzzles
 Darleanow: i mean some of them
 5DN1L: very well then
 5DN1L: do the simplest approach first, then you can convert your solution and throw lambda in
 Darleanow: (abs(x), -x)
 Darleanow: if i understood correctly, it calls the function above, which means that i will take abs value if theres -x and x
 Darleanow: as it's first in the function
 Darleanow: am i right&#160;?
 5DN1L: (abs(x), -x) itself is just a tuple
 5DN1L: lambda x: (abs(x), -x) means that if you pass x to it, it will return that tuple to you
 5DN1L: and the tuple contains two values: absolute value of x and negative of x
 Darleanow: okay thanks, i will learn tuple too&#160;!
 Darleanow: i appreciate your help man thanks
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 5DN1L: tuple is basically a list but immutable
 Darleanow: okay i was going to ask this question,lol
 Darleanow: so we can't append values to it&#160;?
 5DN1L: correct
 5DN1L: can't change it anyway
 5DN1L: once created
 Darleanow: okay i got it&#160;!!
 Darleanow: this is so interesting
 Darleanow: i mean tuples and lambda functions
 5DN1L: many ways to do that puzzle, i did it without tuples and without lambda
 5DN1L: at least during my first attempt
 5DN1L: i solved it using other methods afterwards
 5DN1L: once you've solved it, you can check out others' solutions. you will find many different approaches have been used
 Darleanow: yeah obviously, as all humans don't use their brain the same 
 Darleanow: way
 5DN1L: absolutely :D
 5DN1L: gotta go out for a while
 5DN1L: bye for now
 Darleanow: bye&#160;!!
 stefan-gg: do you have any info about the spring challenge? Is it going to be simmilar like last year or is it going to be in teams like the fall challenge?

 5DN1L: It looks like it's in French only? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55409/exercices---woa---intro-js/annee-bissextile">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55409/exercices---woa---intro-js/annee-bissextile</a>
 5DN1L: Maybe you should ask in #fr channel
 Tekkos: i already did thanks dude
 5DN1L: ah ok
 Tekkos: and that sucks that these exercice are only in fr
 Tekkos: can't u translate it&#160;? i really need to know if  their platform sucks or my brain 
 5DN1L: which page?
 Tekkos: 5/15
 5DN1L: what's the issue
 Tekkos: with the recursive fct
 Tekkos: i tried the code on VSC and i have my data returned
 Tekkos: but on the platform it says that it took too much time
 5DN1L: what's your code
 struct: I think the test is wrong
 struct: at least the année bissexstile
 Tekkos: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/635f6aeb-4b7c-4ddb-9abf-ff4e9a7ef45e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/635f6aeb-4b7c-4ddb-9abf-ff4e9a7ef45e</a>
 5DN1L: is it the issue of the creator or the platform? The contents were not created by CG
 Tekkos: i had no problem on the bissextil year
 Tekkos: i think platform cause on VSC it's working
 NewCoder09: :taco: Tekkos
 5DN1L: ✓ Test 0 succed✓ Test 1 succed✓ Test 2 succed
 5DN1L: then "Your solution did not provide a result in due time"
 5DN1L: that's what i got
 Tekkos: i had the same
 NewCoder09: :taco: Tekkos
 5DN1L: maybe the creator made a buggy test. maybe it's CG's issue. i don't know which one it is
 NewCoder09: :taco: 5DN1L
 5DN1L: NewCoder09 i think antiwonto may be still sleeping
 NewCoder09: iss he asleep?
 VizGhar: what's that about tacos?
 5DN1L: Wontonimo's chat bot feature
 Tekkos: i think its a bad joke about my name
 5DN1L: no it isn't Tekkos
 NewCoder09: yeah took me a minute to realise
 5DN1L: Tekkos I don't know what's wrong with that page, but at least you've passed 3 tests, so i guess you'll just have to move on
 RoboStac: it just looks like your code is too slow - if you put the fast version of that algorithm it works fine
 Tekkos: ok i got ot&#160;!! it's working
 5DN1L: anything about memoisation?
 Tekkos: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/003bf7c7-f1b3-461b-8b80-a157d8f7837c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/003bf7c7-f1b3-461b-8b80-a157d8f7837c</a>
 5DN1L: wow. so you aren't really expected to write a recursion code?
 5DN1L: i didn't read the previous pages so i don't know what these exercises are about
 RoboStac: memoisation works fine too (thats what I tried with the original code)
 5DN1L: ok
 Tekkos: it was not about recursive fct
 Tekkos: memoisation is when you do it with variables&#160;?
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f9eb068-c88d-4913-ba6d-1eba41439d99">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f9eb068-c88d-4913-ba6d-1eba41439d99</a>
 RoboStac: storing results as you call with the same arguements many times
 5DN1L: memoisation is when you store previous results so you don't have to recalculate when the same calculation is needed again later
 eulerscheZahl: robo lost the mod badge too?&#160;:(
 Tekkos: thanks everybody&#160;!
 RoboStac: I lost the mod rights on chat when there was a server problem a while ago and haven't really been around enough for it to be worth trying to get it sorted
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i see
 eulerscheZahl: in return i could moderate non-official channels like #test123 for a while
 RoboStac: especially since it sounded like chat was going to disapear
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't it still sound like that?
 eulerscheZahl: just CG taking a while to roll out the changes
 RoboStac: yes, but it's still here
 StraumliPerversion: us preterists believe the chat has already been deleted
 ionKOT: teach me some tricks to solve these problems&#160;:(
 struct: which one?
 ionKOT: my clash code no loading when timer is 0?
 ionKOT: struct can you be my mentor jkjk:(((
 eulerscheZahl: struct will gladly fill that role
 eulerscheZahl: also: try F5 when the clash doesn't load

 eulerscheZahl: wanted the bot to link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: in case you don't know it
 struct: if he is not online then anti wont be either
 ycsvenom: i thought he had hosted it on heroku or something
 eulerscheZahl: heroku is my puzzle search
 eulerscheZahl: i heard the other anti got canned
 ycsvenom: that tool won't work in some cases in codingame usually i have to hardcode the last parenthesis 
 StraumliPerversion: the other anti?
 eulerscheZahl: squid
 eulerscheZahl: banning darkhorse wasn't the smartest move
 ycsvenom: is anti a js automation or codingame accept that on api or something?
 eulerscheZahl: there is no official API
 ycsvenom: then it is in js?
 struct: yes
 StraumliPerversion: oh, yeah squid went against the narrative, you can't do that any more
 ycsvenom: can i post my CoC contribution here so you can see it and comment or even reject it?
 StraumliPerversion: sure, why not

 StraumliPerversion: I wouldn't be able to do that in 5 minutes, but I'm pretty slow
 struct: except the numbers are not given in input
 struct: you will need to type 10 numbers by hand
 struct: If I got this clash I would just skip it tbh
 struct: I think you should give the 10 numbers in the inputs
 thomas.schuerger: Why do many of the puzzles give a score of +50 XP, regardless of their difficulty? Shouldn't hard puzzles always give more points than easy puzzles? Even many very hard puzzles only give +50 XP.
 struct: Because they are made by the comunity
 struct: only cg official puzzles give more exp
 thomas.schuerger: Really, that is the reason?
 struct: yes
 ionKOT: man i cant solve any of these
 struct: are you doing clashes or puzzles?
 ionKOT: clases
 ionKOT: clashes
 struct: I would do easy puzzles instead
 struct: no time limit
 ionKOT: ok
 StraumliPerversion: I think we need some easier easy puzzles, I have one as a contrib
 Mindarius: You should also get easier clashes if you do private ones instead of public ones. At least I usually do.
 thomas.schuerger: You mean a new category "Very easy"?
 notfreddynocappamcramen: coc
 StraumliPerversion: I think they should publish all clashes as very easy puzzles.  Then we can have fun watching the #fr solving all 10,000 of them for the xp
 Mindarius: :taco: ionKOT
 StraumliPerversion: well, and me also of course
 thomas.schuerger: How many CoCs are approved currently?
 notfreddynocappamcramen: i like coc
 ionKOT: just by looking at the title of the easy puzzle looks like i wouldnt be able to solve any
 thomas.schuerger: Some are easier than they sound
 Mindarius: Yeah easy puzzles have more emphasis on puzzle than easy
 Mindarius: if you're not used to programming puzzles they're still going to seem complicated
 ionKOT: why dont they teach me first
 ionKOT:&#160;:(
 Mindarius: Codingame is built more for practice and self-teaching
 Mindarius: I think kahn academy has tutorials for javascript if you want to try looking at those. Not sure how helpful they would be for codingame stuff.
 ionKOT: i use kotlin or python
 Mindarius: I'm not sure where you'd find tutorials for those, but you should be able to find some pretty easily just searching online
 ionKOT: can i see how you guys would solve a code in python or kotlin? private match
 Mindarius: sure

 veerjain: HLO
 veerjain: YHOW TO USE ANGLES IN CSHARP
 SandmanSW96: angles how?
 SandmanSW96: veerjain
 SandmanSW96: Hey, did they fix the language enforcement on the clash event this time?
 veerjain: idk
 SandmanSW96: do you mean trig functions?
 veerjain: i am new at coding
 SandmanSW96: what is the problem you are trying to solve with angles?
 5DN1L: If you have never learned any programming languages before, I suggest you to go to another website to learn it first, veerjain
 veerjain: mad pod racing
 5DN1L: This website is mainly for practice
 SandmanSW96: you can learn from here
 SandmanSW96: in tandem with tutorial sites
 5DN1L: only if they know how to...
 veerjain: which webste should i use to learn 
 SandmanSW96: onboarding is appropriate for anyone who has never coded before
 SandmanSW96: veerjain if you google "coding tutorial" there will be several good sites in the first hits listed
 veerjain: ok
 5DN1L: He's already done onboarding
 SandmanSW96: but c# is kinda complicated, you can look at other languages here in any puzzle loaded by changing it
 veerjain: ok
 SandmanSW96: for someone who works for this site you're kind of a dick for saying nobody should come here to learn...
 veerjain: who?
 SandmanSW96: not you
 veerjain: ok
 5DN1L: Am I? Thanks for your comment
 5DN1L: I just want to say not everyone is suited to that mode of learning
 darkhorse64: 5DN1L  is a volunteer and does not deserved insults
 SandmanSW96: Well everyone should be allowed to try
 SandmanSW96: someone representing the site shouldn't tell  someone "hit the bricks" just cause they are brand new lol
 SandmanSW96: I even recommend this site to ppl who are brand new and want to try to code
 ionKOT: i dont come here to learn but this site is poorly made for beg trying to challenge them self
 SandmanSW96: it's not designed for ppl to learn true
 ionKOT: they start you off with pre written code like wth..
 5DN1L: I make a suggestion that he can learn it elsewhere first and then come back here to practise. It's less frustrating.
 veerjain: ok
 abt8601: but these pre-written code are only for I/O
 abt8601: you still need to write algorithms yourself
 ionKOT: yea but for a noob its confusing
 5DN1L: Of course people can learn here. But whether it's a suitable place for complete beginners? Not quite so
 SandmanSW96: w/e man I'm not going in circles for an hour over it, I stand by what I said
 veerjain: thanks for the advice
 SandmanSW96: veerjain a couple good sites are w3schools and tutorialspoint
 veerjain: okk
 5DN1L: I don't mind you saying that SandmanSW96, just hope you have more respectful wording.
 veerjain: thank u so much
 SandmanSW96: or if you have a question about a particular say c# command,
 5DN1L: I respect your view. SandmanSW96
 veerjain: ok
 SandmanSW96: if you google just one thing like that, if you see a link from stackoverflow.com appear, thats your best answer
 SandmanSW96: and I stand by my wording
 5DN1L: I won't kick you away because of this conflict of interest. But if you use disrespectful wording on others again, I will absolutely kick you out

 eulerscheZahl:&#160;; at the end. but only works for bitrunner, doesn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: struct shared it publicly on this chat already
 Illedan: And only breaks the viewer
 Illedan: meh

 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Hmm, need 56 xp to level. What is the easiest to do?
 struct: space maze
 Illedan: That was too easy
 Illedan: Already done..
 eulerscheZahl: finish the snake optim
 darkhorse64: make a free xp puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: approval gives 250xp
 Illedan: dbdr wont accept my slow viewer&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: upvoting gives 10 xp
 eulerscheZahl: then make it faster?
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: i'm the expert on slow viewers (dice duel, 2048)
 Illedan: Lvl 44
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: 50xp + review acheivement
 Illedan: lol
 eulerscheZahl: which puzzle did you solve?
 Illedan: REVERSE MINESWEEPER
 eulerscheZahl: that looks boring
 Illedan: Yes
 Illedan: it was
 eulerscheZahl: smits also found the motivation to solve it. i'm out
 ycsvenom: anyone has completed all their achievements?
 ycsvenom: or is their one?
 eulerscheZahl: Magu s had at some point
 eulerscheZahl: some are insanely hard (win a contest)
 eulerscheZahl: others are impossible now (create a community contest)
 ycsvenom: this is not possible in this time
 eulerscheZahl: and "participate in 12 contests" is also somewhere between hard and impossible now
 struct: someone has to win
 eulerscheZahl: be first in 7000 ezpz
 ycsvenom: you almost completed it @eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: could get a few more achievements but meh
 ycsvenom: can you give me tips on bot programming?
 eulerscheZahl: try a game as good as you can. then check the forum for post mortes
 struct: tip 1: c++
 ycsvenom: no problem next
 struct: tip 2: NN
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 ycsvenom: now can you give me a resource where i can learn NN?
 struct: just practice on some bot programming ones
 struct: You dont really need NNs
 struct: unless you want to get 1st place in some multis
 jacek: NN is the final stage
 ycsvenom: i know the theoretical partbut i need more information to implement it
 Illedan: Try 1 NN blog post a week for 3 years before you try NN on bot programming :P
 jacek: which multis are you working on?
 ycsvenom: so please give me any resource :sweat_smile:
 jacek: in many youll only need some heuristics. then learn about mcts, and/or minimax
 jacek: beam search, monte carlo, etc...
 5DN1L: Any resource: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/neural-network-ressources/1667">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/neural-network-ressources/1667</a>
 struct: none of my bots has anything smart
 struct: I just create a sim and then add a search
 struct: noething else
 jacek: so they have your brain's NN?
 struct: yeap
 ycsvenom: thanks @5DN1L
 Illedan: I'm off. Bye
 struct: cya
 jacek: done reverse minesweeper :tada:
 struct: grats
 struct: bitboard?
 jacek: nah, 2d array
 NewCoder09: im bored in class at school
 NewCoder09: im in English what should i do
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 what should NewCoder09 do?
 Automaton2000: maybe you are the bot
 5DN1L: identity crisis
 NewCoder09: oh no
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: :upside_down:
 NewCoder09: :nose_tone3:
 NewCoder09: who made Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: best thing is to make a game for cg&#160;?
 5DN1L: you can read the blog on its profile to know more
 NewCoder09: oh ok
 NewCoder09: Hey AutomatonNN
 NewCoder09: AutomatonNN
 martinpapa69: Automatoff
 5DN1L: :joy:
 NewCoder09: AutomatonNN don't wanna answer
 NewCoder09: :taco: 5DN1L
 NewCoder09: Why nobody wanna answer me?
 5DN1L: Thanks, but I think antiwonto is switched off right now
 NewCoder09: oh dang 
 NewCoder09: that sucks
 NewCoder09: i got a question
 NewCoder09: Nevermind i figured it out
 5DN1L: :clap:
 ninjadip: yeah now the people that need these defibulators know where the closest one is
 ninjadip: i'm so relieved
 NewCoder09: what
 NewCoder09: do you mean 
 5DN1L: And because that means you've finished all the classic easy puzzles? ninjadip
 jacek: but, do they know how to efficiently use the urinal?
 5DN1L: training required

 ninjadip: 5DN1L no, just did the defibrillator thing
 NewCoder09: bro who made that blog?
 jacek: xkcd guy(s)
 NewCoder09: oh 
 ninjadip: what you need is the YOURinal, it's a urinal you can take anywhere! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.amazon.com/Prank-Pack-Yourinal-Standard-Size/dp/B07582JTDZ?th=1">https://www.amazon.com/Prank-Pack-Yourinal-Standard-Size/dp/B07582JTDZ?th=1</a>
 5DN1L: ninjadip, the "classic" easy ones you've done all
 ninjadip: 5DN1L no, i haven't done all the easy ones yet
 NewCoder09: ninjadip bro :joy:
 ninjadip: says 10% completed
 5DN1L: the others are community easy puzzles
 ninjadip: idk what you are getting at
 5DN1L: the classic ones are the ones listed in your achievements
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/4cd879a0416b3d6d35a39e50abd5fbce6263744/achievements">https://www.codingame.com/profile/4cd879a0416b3d6d35a39e50abd5fbce6263744/achievements</a>
 5DN1L: classic means created by CG
 5DN1L: community means created by... community
 ninjadip: yes but my page says both"Classic Puzzle- Easy" 
 ninjadip: so...
 5DN1L: 10% refers to 10% of classic + community
 5DN1L: the classic ones give you more XPs because there are related achievements
 ninjadip: where do i find the list of non-community classic games 
 5DN1L: all listed in your achievements
 5DN1L: the link above
 ninjadip: oh cool then
 ninjadip: i was working towards a 80-90% community goal
 ninjadip: what has been everyone's favorite challenge on here?
 jacek: so, what would be the next event puzzle hm?
 5DN1L: I think some of the classic puzzles were converted from very old contests here
 elderlybeginner: which primality test your are using in CGFunge?
 eulerscheZahl: decision tree to cover validators only
 eulerscheZahl: testing with a list of all prime numbers under 100 would be an option if you want to play properly
 eulerscheZahl: or miller-rabin with only 1 witness
 elderlybeginner: thanks, I will look into that
 jacek: no witnesses!
 eulerscheZahl: did i get the terminology wrong?
 jacek: no, not at all
 jacek: its my obscure trolling again
 ycsvenom: can anyone describe the contest for meit's the first one for me
 jacek: no one knows yet. it will be ai contest
 ycsvenom: :sweat_smile:
 jacek: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020</a>

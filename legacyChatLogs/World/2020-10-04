 eulerscheZahl: the first dozen or so
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: All lvl 7...
 eulerscheZahl: AlkhilJohn has more followers than me
 eulerscheZahl: even marchete and AntiSquid follow that bot :D
 professional_dumbass:&#160;:)
 Marchete: moin
 eulerscheZahl: moinhow's the bot doing that you follow?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i drifted to #1 again
 Westicles: 1st out of 2 million, not bad
 eulerscheZahl: you are in the top3k already, you haven't even played half the games here
 Westicles: No bots for me.  But I finally figured out your NS python script

 eulerscheZahl: yay
 professional_dumbass: I'm trying to learn quaternions 
 professional_dumbass: they seem to confuse me
 professional_dumbass: 3b1b's videos helped me understand them
 professional_dumbass: but i still get confused when i try to imagine it
 professional_dumbass: I just need to learn it for unity, but euler angles are still intuitive except for the gimbal lock problem
 Borealiss: just look at quaternions as fancy eulerAngles, unless you really need to get down into the variables
 jrke: someone pushed pb4 first in CSB 
 Borealiss: pb4?
 eulerscheZahl: a user who won 2 contests
 jrke: top 3 are too close .....
 professional_dumbass: oh wait i never noticed
 professional_dumbass: eulerscheZahl's name has "euler" in it
 professional_dumbass: lol
 jrke: congrats you noticed it
 professional_dumbass: lmao
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl is German for Euler's number
 eulerscheZahl: 2.718281828459045235360...
 professional_dumbass: wait WUT
 jacek: impossibru
 professional_dumbass: that's great
 professional_dumbass: eulers identity
 professional_dumbass: e^pi i = 1
 eulerscheZahl: -1
 professional_dumbass: my dast doesn't work
 professional_dumbass: *dash
 professional_dumbass: so couldn't write the negative
 eulerscheZahl: then write e^(i*pi)+1 = 0 :P
 professional_dumbass: dash is just shift plus 1
 professional_dumbass: and my dash doesn't work
 professional_dumbass: lol
 professional_dumbass: *shift plus dash
 eulerscheZahl: oh. we have different keyboard layouts then

 eulerscheZahl: ubuntu + chromium
 professional_dumbass: ah, that's the reason
 professional_dumbass: is it your main, or dual boot?
 eulerscheZahl: my only system
 professional_dumbass: ah noice
 eulerscheZahl: i have a windows on my office machine
 eulerscheZahl: which is also here since Covid
 professional_dumbass: i have heard of siemens 
 professional_dumbass: is it an electronic manufacturing company?
 professional_dumbass: i might be wrong 😅
 eulerscheZahl: makes a lot

 AntiSquid: windows will eventually become a linux distro: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i've heard about that theory
 eulerscheZahl: won't believe it without any official statement
 AntiSquid: sounds very plausible since MS is about making moneyz and if NT kernel dies out since they don't want to invest in it due to maintenance costs, they get the linux kernel&#160;! :o
 eulerscheZahl: what about all the proprietary drivers? port to linux?
 AntiSquid: are you saying that's not possible or unlikely?
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely
 eulerscheZahl: of course it's possible. Turing completeness and such
 AntiSquid: someone will push for it imo
 AntiSquid: i use the proprietary nvidia drivers on linux 
 jrke: is there anyone having linux who can help me in one thing
 AntiSquid: ok but only the one thing, never ask for help again afterwards
 eulerscheZahl: i see that windows made big steps towards linux. but replacing their own kernel seems unlikely to me
 jrke: can you install gfootball module for python
 jrke: pip installl gfootball
 AntiSquid: why?
 eulerscheZahl: do i want to install it? :thinking:
 jrke: cause its not installing in windows
 jrke: some says its for linux
 AntiSquid: The author of this package has not provided a project description
 jrke: so im editing itd repo but failing everytime
 jrke: its*
 AntiSquid: ya that's why i use linux jrke

 jrke: Kaggle says for windows use docker for gfootball 
 jrke: what is docker and how to use it?
 eulerscheZahl: docker is a bit like a virtual machine
 eulerscheZahl: but using parts of your host OS
 eulerscheZahl: it's a container that brings some preinstalled stuff
 jrke: gcr.io/kaggle-images/python-simulations

 professional_dumbass: lol
 akkasayaz: hi
 akkasayaz: I can solve puzzles in other sites but in this site I am not really good, I cant solve even the easiest ones can you help me to figure out my problem?
 SquareRoot19: maybe its the inputting system that makes the code look complicated
 akkasayaz: yeah it is a bit different but also animations i think
 jacek: what kind of puzzles
 jacek: some are just text
 akkasayaz: I dont know I just click practice and try easy puzzles
 akkasayaz: for example thor  and light one
 jacek: the animations is just for fun. most puzzles are just inputs and outputs
 jacek: maybe try something like horse duals
 Flat_Erick: Hey guys! Does anybody know if any of the inputs returns the mining gold rate in Code Royale?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Flat_Erick: Alright I can see now. Thanks!

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global</a>
 starmaq: thanks a lot
 starmaq: I just realized how stupid I am
 starmaq: it was in front of my eyes
 starmaq: alright so someone has two times more clashes then me, but has only 25% more score, that means I'm better right
 starmaq: well nvm
 starmaq: I guess it's a ratio and can change anytime
 develoore: clash score degrades over time
 starmaq: yeah
 starmaq: what's probably lowering my score is quitting because I either already did the challenge, or it's some obnoxious one
 jacek: why would you quit if you did it
 eulerscheZahl: because it would be boring to do the same again
 HuynhNgocHai: hello
 AntiSquid: hi
 Shadowtick: hey
 fabulus: xzxy
 Dan4Life: guys why arent there any graph related questions in clash of code

 Dan4Life: cool
 Dan4Life: im new to creating problems, so is there any article explaining how to generate testcases..? or do i hv to do it manually
 Dan4Life: nvm
 Shadowtick: I dont know if there is
 jacek: well there are puzzles with graphs
 jacek: and games
 Shadowtick: can I have some help doing the if nextCheckpointAngle and nextCheckpointDist please?
 Shadowtick: because I'm stuck on it
 jacek: whats the problem
 Shadowtick: I don't know it is underlining it and saying expecetd '('
 Shadowtick: expected*
 jacek: what language
 Shadowtick: javascript
 Shadowtick: which is the only one I can do the best
 jacek: and the code? so you probably have some missed ( or )

 PatrickMcGinnisII: surround your conditional with parens
 Shadowtick: I fixed it I needed to put it this way (nextCheckpointAngle &gt;  -180) or (nextCheckpointAngle &gt;  180)
 Shadowtick: I had found out when I looked at it again
 jacek: rubber duck debugging eh
 Shadowtick: I am starting to understand it more so im gonna try to figure it out myself but only the things I know I could
 Majeck: I hate when in clash of code you pass all the validation tests only to get an 80% score at the end&#160;:/
 jacek: fire your QA team
 Shadowtick: I am stuck again
 LastRick: Feel for you, Majeck. Validators are probably my biggest source of frustration on here.
 eulerscheZahl: if you have played 300+ clashes, you can edit them
 Majeck: Wait really?
 Majeck: How?
 eulerscheZahl: add extra testcases to make sure they cover everything and prevent other games from the same frustration
 eulerscheZahl: first step: find the clash
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: open the contribution. there's an edit button if you played enough clashes
 eulerscheZahl: (disabled for some, very old contributions)
 Majeck: Woahhhhhhh
 LastRick: Thanks, I didn't know this either.
 eulerscheZahl: make CG a better place&#160;:)
 Majeck: I'm definitely going to use that, from now on, thanks euler
 LastRick: What about for the IN/OUT puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: needs lvl 29+ to edit
 eulerscheZahl: but you can always raise your concerns here in the chat or in the forum. usually you'll find someone willing to edit
 Majeck: Woah
 Majeck: +300 clashes and +lvl29 are two different things
 eulerscheZahl: yes. i can edit puzzles but not clashes :D
 LastRick: I usually pose my concern in the discussion section of the puzzle but don't seem to get much response from the author. 
 Majeck: Huh, when even number 2 on this site isn't over the level requirement
 Majeck: Oh never mind
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i don't even open those lengthy threads. i'll have a look at your previous forum posts LastRick
 Majeck: You're level 53
 Majeck: Oh and you're first!
 Majeck: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: going up and down, on par with Royale
 Majeck: Wait, why can't you edit clashes euler?
 eulerscheZahl: that's right
 eulerscheZahl: but i can edit forum posts or kick/ban from the chat :D
 eulerscheZahl: CG logic
 Majeck: Aren't you a CG admin or somethin'?
 Majeck: You have the logo next to your name
 eulerscheZahl: i don't work for CG, i'm a normal community member
 eulerscheZahl: the logo says i'm a mod on the chat
 Majeck: Oh
 Majeck: Can you delete messages in the chat?
 LastRick: Thanks. I totally understand the need for validators (hard coding) but since it happens post submission, I often don't have a good way of debugging. Guess I gotta get that level 29!&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no, the chat doesn't support that
 eulerscheZahl: is that roman numbers question still relevant?
 Majeck: *starts writing lengthy racist comment chock-full of curse words*
 eulerscheZahl: "These Romans are crazy!"hm, that's one of those really old puzzles that I can't edit
 Majeck: Wait uhhhh did I accidentaly say I had problems in the roman numerals puzlle?
 Majeck: *puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: no, reading old forum posts from LastRick
 eulerscheZahl: as he said there's rarely any reaction to them
 Majeck: Oh ok, cause I just aced that clash and was worried I accidentally submitted my complaint to that one
 LastRick: Romans Are Crazy: nope, solved that one.
 Majeck: Wait so euler if my understanding is correct only CG devs can edit clash of code test validators?
 eulerscheZahl: everyone with 300+ clashes can edit most of them
 eulerscheZahl: there are a few old one that can only be edited by staff
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they changed the way how community contributions work and didn't update the frontend to account for the old way
 eulerscheZahl: LastRick for the \ domino puzzle /

 eulerscheZahl: find your bug, generate an extra testcase+validator where your current code fails
 eulerscheZahl: then i'll add it
 LastRick: ok
 Shadowtick: ok I am needing help with my code a ton
 Shadowtick: I don't know what I have to change in it
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know what your code or current problem is
 Orlando77: Somebody knows how to terminate the program? because I want to finish it, but I can't

 eulerscheZahl: }elseIf; { 
 eulerscheZahl: that line looks wrong
 Shadowtick: ok
 eulerscheZahl: and you should use the thrust in your print statement (thus moving it below the if-else block)
 Shadowtick: ok the or needed to be like thisif (nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90) (or) (nextCheckpointAngle &gt; -90)
 eulerscheZahl: this is javascript, right?
 Shadowtick: yes
 jacek: :scream:
 Shadowtick: I am doing javascript

 eulerscheZahl: try this
 Shadowtick: ok
 jacek: you can do or in javascript
 jacek:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no. that's why i changed it
 eulerscheZahl: there is no "or"there is ||
 eulerscheZahl: Python has "or"so does Pascal
 eulerscheZahl: maybe VB? i don't really know the language but wouldn't surprise me
 17steen: vb has "or"
 Shadowtick: my pod wasn't moving when I used that code
 Shadowtick: it just didn't move at all
 Shadowtick: my code I had made it move a some
 eulerscheZahl: did you promote a league already?
 eulerscheZahl: the input format changes at some point
 Shadowtick: I am in league two it says
 eulerscheZahl: there's an arrow at the top right of the IDE to reset your code. click it
 eulerscheZahl: that might change your input parsing
 Shadowtick: it changed it all the way back to the start of the code
 eulerscheZahl: can you share that code in the chat?
 Shadowtick: sure
 Shadowtick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e3c556d-31dc-48c4-bade-7a55c41caaaf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e3c556d-31dc-48c4-bade-7a55c41caaaf</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so, the new code reads 2 lines from input
 Shadowtick: ok
 Shadowtick: so what will I need to change in it?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you even used nextCheckpointAngle without declaring it :D
 Shadowtick: it put it in when I hit reset
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b11ee48-c06c-4d88-86cf-db6120daeb88">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b11ee48-c06c-4d88-86cf-db6120daeb88</a>
 eulerscheZahl: try this
 Shadowtick: when I reset the code it put all that stuff in
 eulerscheZahl: IMO the league system of coders strike back is a bit flawed. the input format changes a few times
 eulerscheZahl: CG learned from it, later games are more consistent
 Shadowtick: ok
 Shadowtick: how do I make my pod gain speed?
 eulerscheZahl: keep using a thrust of 100
 eulerscheZahl: is your pod moving now?
 Shadowtick: ok it is but now I have to change it from 80 to 100
 eulerscheZahl: personal opinion: CSB isn't the best game to get into bot programming. even if it's the one that CG promotes as an introduction
 Shadowtick: it is taking forever to stop turning
 Shadowtick: here is the replay to show you
 Shadowtick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/490977021">https://www.codingame.com/replay/490977021</a>
 Shadowtick: see how long it takes to stop turning?
 eulerscheZahl: you can only turn 18 degrees each turn
 Shadowtick: ok
 Shadowtick: can you make it go faster than 100?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Shadowtick: awww
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1 BOOST
 Shadowtick: what?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't know what league, but BOOST becomes a new rule, use once per pod for an acc. of 650
 Majeck: Thanks @eulerscheZahl for the help, turns out one of the validators tested something that none of the tescases did :P 
 Shadowtick: I am in woodleague 2
 Majeck: Submitted an extra test case that should fix that
 eulerscheZahl: great
 Majeck: Also your site <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles</a> rocks!
 Doju: Arghh
 Doju: trying to learn c++ is just painful after python
 Shadowtick: I am editing the numbers so I can see what is better for turning
 Shadowtick: apparently 85 to 99 is the best for turning but not for speed
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Majeck
 Shadowtick: I made a site using caret and a server starter
 Shadowtick: but my website sucks
 Majeck: @Doju is C++ your first statically typed language?
 Doju: Yes, Majeck
 eulerscheZahl: is caret some web framework i don't know?
 Doju: I don't think that static typing is the problem, though
 Doju: it's just all kinds of weird everywhere
 Majeck: Yeah, my first language was Javascript and I basically had to learn programming from scratch again to understand C# lol
 Doju: Everything feels like it's bolted onto the language rather than built in
 Shadowtick: eulerscheZahl I will send you the link to it
 eulerscheZahl: next: learn how computers work from scratch to understand C/C++
 Majeck: Hahahhahahahha
 Majeck: @Doju going from C# to java feels exactly like that lol
 Majeck: In java String is not a primitive type rather a class
 Majeck: and using == on a String doesn't work, you have no idea how much problems that has caused over the lifespan of Java
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Shadowtick don't want to ruin it for you, but to start if your angle to CP is &lt; 90 just thrust=100 else thrust = 0   and adjust your target coordinates , there are a few little ways to do this...most use a vx &amp; vy method.  In JS i think you use Math.atan2 function to get your angle...you prolly know this laready, i shutup
 Majeck: Also almost every other library has a different naming convention lol
 Doju: yuck
 Doju: okay but like the latest thing that bothers me with c++ is including files
 Doju: why why why is it done with header files
 Doju: python's way of importing files is so simple
 Majeck: Yesssssssss
 Majeck: f = open(fileName)
 Majeck: In Java you need to import like 3 different classes to open a file lol
 Doju: hahah
 Doju: wait i mean importing other code files
 Majeck: ohhhhhh
 Doju: like dividing your project into multiple files
 Majeck: What a coincidence in the project I'm working on I tried to do just that yesterday and failed miserably
 Majeck: So now I just have one main folder with like 30+ classes lol
 Doju: in python you can just do "import other_file"
 eulerscheZahl: with open(filename) as f:
 eulerscheZahl: that way you close the stream when you are done
 Majeck: shut up nerd
 ryantimjohn: you leave that man alone
 Majeck: Yeah, you're right though the amount of times I've forgetten the f.close()
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 kernels meet in a bar, one is name Darwin, 1 is Kali, and 1 is 1803. they all call C++ their momma, who do they call their daddy?
 Majeck: I don't know, what?
 Majeck: *whom
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Pop
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :popcorn:
 AntiSquid: i don't get it&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: and why is one named darwin and the other one 1803&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mac, linux, win10
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Nevermind, I not funny
 HungryBurger: Popcorn kernels...
 AntiSquid: no it's not funny . i just checked darwin which you can compile and not run as macos and windows10 1803 whcih is a failed windows version all piled together with kali which is a highly respected distro
 AntiSquid: apply for GPT-3 API so you can use it to rephrase your jokes maybe
 AntiSquid: oh wait, i am not sure you can still apply for it ... i've read some news recently regarding that
 Shadowtick: ...
 LastRick: Anyone know if theres a way to send a message  in this window directly to a user?
 AntiSquid: Hi Mr Shadowtick do you disagree with my opinion of Kali Linux Distro?
 AntiSquid:  /msg user_name
 AntiSquid: LastRick
 LastRick: thanks
 AntiSquid: np
 PatrickMcGinnisII: At least the distros have names,  windows...1803...that in itself is a joke
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i'm wrong i guess they call it Redstone... but i think most of them are numbers
 Shadowtick: I am confused about what's happening
 AntiSquid: once microsoft switches from NT to a linux kernel we can have Red Star Windows distro
 AntiSquid: Shadowtick just skip the parts you don't understand you will get there eventually. Best way to read chat.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i remember when NT came on 4 3.5" disks, most stable as I recall 'cause win32 had some really sloppy coders
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or maybe it was still win16, pfft
 AntiSquid: i remember some blue background windows NT browser with 3 columns, but can't remember what version it was
 AntiSquid: or was it more than 3 columns? forgot this part
 PatrickMcGinnisII: First Linux I played with ran a VHS movie store catalogue rental database, i think they called it unix for pc or unixware...some crap, but it worked well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: If you were in college before the internet (like me), you had to learn some Unix and program in pascal for the most part
 PatrickMcGinnisII: showing my age, I'll shutup
 AntiSquid: not that old
 AntiSquid: first linux i tried years ago made my head spin though ... i just remember being asked millions of questions of how i want to install my linux ... after about 2 hours in i gave up, didn't know what's going on and didn't have a manual for it
 Shadowtick: ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: redhat was my first real successful use of linux, but I felt like I was in a porno mounting everything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and graphics drivers really pissed me off
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now you can boot off a thumbdrive, good times
 AntiSquid: now you can play high FPS games on linux&#160;!! 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm completely re-writing my penguin bot, taking forever
 Shadowtick: I play more mobile games than computer anymore
 jacek: linux bot?
 AntiSquid: rewriting his tux mascot
 Shadowtick: I play call of duty mobile and dead by daylight mobile mainly
 Shadowtick: and some minecraft
 jacek: mobile?
 AntiSquid: every little step to skip windows helps
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shadow, lookk like 5 night at freddys
 Shadowtick: cod mobile and dead by daylight mobile are for phones and mobile devices
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Found out last night my phone has like a 3ghz 8 core processor w/ like adaptive led display in HD, I'm like...i gotta go back to doing more java
 AntiSquid: java for android apps? isn't kotlin still the best option?
 jacek: their interchangable
 jacek: you can write in either class by class
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dunno, don't know Kotlin
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i compiled some basic stuff for phones, but I got caught up in the notification and SMS methods, it has changed so much
 jacek: eeyup, security and backgrouns tasks changed and constantly changing with newer android versions
 jacek: but also libraries, architecture designs etc
 jacek: its almost like new javascript lib meme
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wrap it, wrap it again, and make it look like xml while your at it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what neme?  IT clown guy?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er meme
 Noisestorm: Hey all, anyone know if the 3rd achievement on Skynet Revolution EP1 (Medium) is bugged?
 Noisestorm: Got 100% with 65 moves left but noticed I got only 2/3 achievements
 jacek: well, js get new libs so often that 2 new hypeds frameworks were created since i started this sentence
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Noisestorm i didn't get achiev 3, i had 44 left ... so sunno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er dunno
 Noisestorm: Maybe it had to be done first try? Mah...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek yes, lol ...  and it never ends
 AntiSquid: no you don't need to get it right first try Noisestorm
 AntiSquid: that'd be ridiculous
 AntiSquid: more ridiculous than 1st in a contest Q_Q
 Noisestorm: I agree, but seems a likely bug, else I would have it atm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its possible because the number of links left + the number of turns doesn't equal the strating value for number of links
 Noisestorm:&#160;??
 Noisestorm: I am relying on the number shown on the top right corner where it says "Links left"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eg.  links left at start is 79. 41 turns later the links left is 44...that adds up to 85, not 79
 Noisestorm: Which for me is 64 which I'm not sure but should be more than 50 :sleepy:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: share replay
 Noisestorm: You can find my code in the Python3 section
 Noisestorm: Probably easier for you to run it and try
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/490993136">https://www.codingame.com/replay/490993136</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mine, but i fail at &gt;50
 Noisestorm: Oh didn't know that was a feature, here it is: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/490993807">https://www.codingame.com/replay/490993807</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i tried severing already severed links
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so my turns+severed wouldn't equal the start links
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the results from the validator are what counts
 Noisestorm: "Finish the 4th test of the "Skynet: the virus" puzzle with 50 or more remaining links and get a 100% score."
 Noisestorm: These should be the only conditions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but the validator 4 is probably differrent from test 4
 Noisestorm: Ok that makes sense...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh the validators ares hown in the details
 PatrickMcGinnisII: result-&gt;my report-&gt;details-&gt;validator 4...did you share that one?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks the same, hmmm, maybe the links are input different or something.  What you are saying makes perfect sense, I just haven't done it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: because my replays for test4 and validator 4 although they appear the same, my prog outputs different stuff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hope that helps
 Noisestorm: Ok you were right, I'm off by 5 on the validator
 menelopesph: i am new what  do you suggest i do
 Noisestorm: New to the site or programming?
 menelopesph: the site but i am learning coding
 Noisestorm: Well, wither way I believe Clash of Code is a good start: you get very fast paced coding problems and also get to see how other people performed, so you can improve and learn new tricks
 jacek: and/or easy puzzles
 menelopesph: ok thxs
 Noisestorm: Clash of Code is found under the Compete section
 indep: Hi! I solved one puzzle, passed all test case, but when i submit, 2 validator test cases failes. I dont' know, what can be wrong. What can i do in this case?
 jacek: your code doesnt cover all cases
 AbdulrahmanHatim: hiya
 AbdulrahmanHatim: sup everyone
 Laminator: has anyone done a coderpad interview before? I'm not sure what to expect
 Allis: Seems like they get to watch you code, presumably with a focus on how you go about solving their riddles.
 Allis: I would assume they get to see how you deal with error messages and the like, but it's basically still whiteboarding where you get to run the code.
 MadKnight: anyone wanna discuss some coding styles&#160;?
 Dan4Life: guys i want to restart my bot in coders strike back, is there a way to do so?
 Dan4Life: i really need a fresh start
 Ridakz: there is a refresh button top right of IDE
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: dan4life refresh button, or you could simply ctrl+A del
 jrke: ctrl+a del will remove all code refreshing code will give you code with all inputs or you can say simple strarter code
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Tru
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: But he said fresh start
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: My rank back up to 3567 after some CoC
 dotcatmoi: i am gay
 dotcatmoi: are you gay
 KiwiTae: dotcatmoi awesome 
 dotcatmoi: snap for more info
 KiwiTae: MadKnight o/ been awhile lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: CoC = Clash of code
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: OwO KiwiTae
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Haven't seen u in a while
 KiwiTae: did u change name i cant recall lool
 KiwiTae: I been busy shippin my game on nintendo switch .. now struggle hardwith ps4 stuf ~
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: .-.

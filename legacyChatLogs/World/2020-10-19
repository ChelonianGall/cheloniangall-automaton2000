 Tanny2009: i woke up at exatcly 7:00
 Tanny2009: and im still tired :sleeping:
 Shadowtick: I woke up at exactly 6:00 am
 Shadowtick: and I have a cup of coffee to get me through my day
 Shadowtick: so I will be awake :3
 Tanny2009: 7:00 MT
 Tanny2009: moutain time?
 Shadowtick: hold on let me go get a clock for the time where I am
 Tanny2009: k
 Tanny2009: im in canada so if anyone is in usa or a different country than it is a different time'

 LinhT.Nguyen: Hello Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i want to learn more
 LinhT.Nguyen: What do you want to learn Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: because it takes time to get #1
 LinhT.Nguyen: What about you AutomatonNN
 DomiKo: AutomatonNN [*]
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 where is AutomatonNN?
 Automaton2000: i don't think that i am getting the error
 Scarfield: toad kicked NN
 jacek: toadfield doesnt like to be hilighted
 MSmits: hey, I was gonna code your jacekmax today jacek... but then I had another idea  to speed up my endgame book :P
 Marchete: what's jacekmax? :D
 MSmits: it's jaceks version of best first minimax
 MSmits: backpropagating the best eval 
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 MSmits: so like mcts, but instead of doing wins/visits you just take the eval
 MSmits: it's almost EPT depth 0, except with that you add up all eval scores like you do with win scores
 MSmits: in this case you replace them minimax style
 MSmits: i think i can code it in an hour or two at the most
 MSmits: Astrobytes I had an idea to fix my cache issue
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah?
 MSmits: i was storing the information per gamestate as 180 values, one for each turn
 MSmits: so turn 20-180
 MSmits: err 20-200
 MSmits: but when i am doing retrograde I am doing all states with 1 turn left, then all states with 2 turns left, then all states with 3 turns left etc.
 MSmits: so its better if all states with 1 turn left are close together
 MSmits: then when you're doing 2 turns, you can look the 1 turn stuff up fast
 Astrobytes: yes for sure
 Astrobytes: that makes sense, I thought you'd be doing something like that already!
 MSmits: apparently not!
 MSmits: then i started thinking more. I stopped my local database at 15 seeds, because beyond that i couldnt keep everything in memory
 MSmits: but what i didnt realize is that i only need to keep the last turn in memory
 MSmits: and maybe the current turn
 MSmits: so thats 100 times less memory
 MSmits: so it's the same issue really
 MSmits: I need to do 1 turn, then write to HD
 MSmits: then do another etc.
 Astrobytes: Yes, storing everything seems pretty redundant
 MSmits: i was thinking in terms of seed databases, seed 1, seed 2 etc.
 MSmits: but what i really should have been doing was turn databases
 MSmits: I calculate I can do my local db up to 25 seeds with this improvement
 Astrobytes: jeez man, that's something
 Astrobytes: Have you started on it yet?
 Astrobytes: (so much for "I'm done with Oware" :P )
 MSmits: nah, I just thought of it on my way home from the train :P
 Astrobytes: Keep me updated, it sounds promising
 MSmits: yeah, it might take a while to calculate, so i might need a pause/resume function
 Astrobytes: that's trivial enough
 MSmits: also, HD space.  I need to think about really compactify, because it's gonna be big
 MSmits: 200 billion values
 MSmits: mmh thats too big i think :P
 Astrobytes: you're not compressing it already?
 MSmits: well it's not very compressible I think
 MSmits: I will just serialize it in as few bits as i can
 MSmits: 200 billion times 6 bits
 MSmits: mmh that's actually possible
 MSmits: uses half my HD though
 Astrobytes: lol that poor HD
 MSmits: i might not go as far as 25, but we'll see
 Astrobytes: It might not be worth it
 MSmits: yeah. By the way. I think a supercomputer could solve this game easily
 MSmits: just need 200 TB of space
 MSmits: it's like the paper about solving Awari. It has less than 1 trillion states if you dont consider the turn
 MSmits: with the turn it's 200 trillion
 MSmits: but that solves the infinite loop problem, because turns never go beyond 200
 Astrobytes: Maybe you should contact the authors&#160;;)
 MSmits: nah, it won't be interesting to them, the 200 turn limit is artificial
 MSmits: it's just to deal with CG limits
 MSmits: but it's essential in how you play this game
 Astrobytes: Still interesting enough I'd say
 Astrobytes: They might find you 200TB of storage and a supercomputer :P
 MSmits: They are Romein and Bal, I think they lost interest. their database is no longe rup either
 MSmits: someone claimed they made mistakes
 MSmits: but it's impossible to check now
 Astrobytes: oh right, yeah, I remember this discussion from before
 MSmits: anyways, gonna work on the live bot first, before i try and tackle the  issue of the local db
 Astrobytes: Make an article like the CSB Nash-DQN one
 MSmits: Yeah, I might
 Astrobytes: when [if] you finish
 MSmits: I don't think anyone wrote anything about endgame DB's before
 MSmits: on CG I mean
 Astrobytes: I've not seen anything no
 MSmits: I did two of them now and I think I have the biggest one for either game. 
 MSmits: 9 seed oware and 12 squares Bandas
 MSmits: I think the next biggest for bandas is 9
 Astrobytes: who has that?
 MSmits: Nagrarok, I was told
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 MSmits: interestingly... I dont think karliso has one
 MSmits: so he's wrecking us in some mysterious way again
 Astrobytes: He's just using the karl iso magic again 
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: is bandas based on a real game btw?
 MSmits: I think so, but I dont remember which. 
 Astrobytes: I remember searching for it but don't think I found anything
 MSmits: An AI multiplayer game made with the Codingame SDKBased on Frutiparc Frutibandas gameAssets by Kenney Vleugels
 eulerscheZahl: i found <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14469/banda">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14469/banda</a>
 eulerscheZahl: which is now what i was looking for
 eulerscheZahl: *not
 jacek: karlisomax?
 Astrobytes: ah thx MSmits
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/exwUIOF">https://imgur.com/a/exwUIOF</a>
 MSmits: all i could find
 Astrobytes: MonteKarlisoTreeSearch
 MSmits: good one
 MSmits: not to be confused with MadKnightTreeSearch
 jacek: MonteCegTreeSearch
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 Astrobytes: hahaha 
 MSmits: I imagine that's an algorithm to find a tree in a forest
 eulerscheZahl: MonteCegTumbleSearch
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: PlumTreeSearch, for his Prune Array
 Astrobytes: (prunes are dried plums)
 MSmits: he has a prune array?
 Astrobytes: He did yes
 Astrobytes: Only he knows what it did or what it was
 MSmits: you get an interesting combination of results if you google prune array
 MSmits: graphs, construction tools and hygiene products
 jacek: it was his misunderstaing of how alpha beta works
 eulerscheZahl: next time he's online remind me to suggest him caching array lookups
 Astrobytes: ah yes, that was it jacek
 Astrobytes: cegpracache :D
 MSmits: thats maybe a real name
 Astrobytes: that was genius that one
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: nope it's unique
 MSmits: google has no idea what that is
 MSmits: which is impressive
 Astrobytes: I did find a Pracache Ulvanolanit
 MSmits: poor guy
 MSmits: or&#160;?
 Astrobytes: no idea
 jacek: by HHD you really mean HDD with spinning motor?
 jacek: HDD~
 MSmits: me? I dunno, I have a SSD and one of those old ones on my system
 jacek: alright
 jacek: i almost felt pity and was gonna send you fast SSD
 MSmits: seems like i have a SSD of 500 gb,and two of those spinning motor things, one of 500 GB and one of 1 TB
 MSmits: maybe I'll start a service where you send me a SSD and I send you one back with a oware seed DB :P
 jacek: then youll get owned by piracy. ill use that to *seed* torrent
 KiwiTae: i dont have a computer&#160;:(
 MSmits: gonna make some mad :moneybag:
 MSmits: who would not want an oware seed db
 MSmits: lol jacek&#160;:)
 MSmits: would be funny to see a torrent for an endgame db
 jacek: i bet there are for chess
 MSmits: KiwiTae, you are doing CG on your phone?
 MSmits: jacek no doubt, maybe even checkers
 Astrobytes: XxX-SeedDB-bY-5m1751.torrent
 Shadowtick: hello
 MSmits: though there is no need, that checkerboard website shares checkers db up to 8 pieces
 MSmits: 10 pieces uses insane HD space
 MSmits: Astrobytes that doesnt look SFW :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Shadowtick: what did I just walk into???
 ZarthaxX: a beautiful place
 MSmits: you say that every day Shadowtick
 MSmits: maybe by now you should have the answer :P
 Astrobytes: a discussion about seed databases, torrents and storage
 Astrobytes: *endgame databases
 Shadowtick: I know but now I am actually confused about it even more than the last ones MSmits
 MSmits: ah ok. I could explain it so you'll understand it, but I am afraid you'll leave halfway through
 Astrobytes: Please explain it.
 Astrobytes: :P
 ZarthaxX: Annoybytes
 Shadowtick: well I am gonna be coding and have the chat shrunk down
 Shadowtick: hidden*
 MSmits: I don't fit in a shrunken chat, unfortunately
 Astrobytes: Zarthonium
 ZarthaxX: wall of text smito :P
 maras: Is there a way to fight against the boss using the CGBenchmark? Does the boss have an ID or something?
 Shadowtick: I meant I am gonna hide ittt
 MSmits: sure, flee again
 Astrobytes: ITTT? Infinite Tic Tac Toe?
 MSmits: maras, there is, i dont remember
 MSmits: maybe it says on the website
 Astrobytes: it's on the forum somewhere
 MSmits: it has some player id
 MSmits: i think
 maras: That's great news, I'll try to find it then
 jacek: :o
 Astrobytes: maras:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cgbenchmark-tool/2956/27">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cgbenchmark-tool/2956/27</a>
 MSmits: Astrobytes uttt is already ittt, it never ends
 Astrobytes: fair point
 MSmits: Yes you can. You have 2 options&#160;:
 MSmits: Find the replay of a game with the boss. Open your browser console and look at the JSON response, it contains the agentId of the boss
 Astrobytes: that's what I just linked :P
 maras: :heart:
 MSmits: yeah
 maras: thanks a lot
 MSmits: I saved him the click 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh you linked the specific part of the forum thread
 MSmits: i thought i just lucked out and it popped up in the rigth place :P
 MSmits: this linking is too advanced for me
 Astrobytes: no it saves the post number in the url
 Astrobytes:  as you scroll down the page
 MSmits: ahh nice
 Astrobytes: yeah, handy
 Shadowtick: alright Imma just go so have a great week everyone
 Astrobytes: and you
 MSmits: yeah, keep thinking about what you ran into
 MSmits: maybe tomorrow you'll know
 MSmits: otherwise just ask us again
 Astrobytes: Shadow tick walks into a bar. Says 'ouch'.
 DJBouncyPirate_fc6f: 你
 MSmits: DJBouncyPirate_fc6f that's just depth 0, not much of an opening book tbh
 jacek: thats neat compression
 jacek: it fits 49 seeds of uttt
 MSmits: i think we broke jacek, he's mixing up games now
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 Astrobytes: My pods keep running out of sanity.
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: let's make these jokes as "inside" as possible
 MSmits: if ZarthaxX doesn't get it, we're doin good
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes:   :D
 MSmits: :P
 ZarthaxX: it's easy as i havent been here for months heh
 ZarthaxX: but good luck
 MSmits: you didnt get the opening book joke?
 MSmits: I can explain, wont be as funny ofc :P
 Astrobytes: HumouraxX
 MSmits: I thought you were only doing this with scarfield
 MSmits: or was this because ZarthaxX was gone
 MSmits: is scarfield ZarthaxX replacement?
 Astrobytes: No, it started with AnthraxX
 MSmits: ohh ok
 jacek: wooo new puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: ScarthaxX :o
 MSmits: that sounds like a weird mafia thing
 Astrobytes: and Zarfield
 ZarthaxX: what opening book joke?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/697a8695-2447-4392-bd82-8173a661a0a5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/697a8695-2447-4392-bd82-8173a661a0a5</a>
 MSmits: ffs
 MSmits: DJBouncyPirate_fc6f 05:04PM你
 ZarthaxX: wat
 MSmits: MSmits 05:04PMDJBouncyPirate_fc6f that's just depth 0, not much of an opening book tbh
 ZarthaxX: ah 
 ZarthaxX: compressing your opening book with special chars
 MSmits: yeah, i thought you would have gotten that one
 ZarthaxX: i lived that part of cg :P
 MSmits: oh how did you use this?
 MSmits: I struggled with it over the weekend. Finally managed to get that working, but it wasn't easy
 ZarthaxX: i meant i saw a lot of opening book compression shenanigans haha
 MSmits: ah ok yes
 ZarthaxX: i never did it myself
 Astrobytes: you gonna join the contest Zartho?
 jacek: nowadays is NN compression
 MSmits: I never needed to before, because my opening books were always small
 MSmits: but endgame books are massive
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes maybe
 Astrobytes: cool cool
 MSmits: jacek how does the size of the NN scale with the time needed to train it until it tapers off?
 MSmits: say if you used the same NN, but twice as many constants
 ZarthaxX: the problem is that uni is gonna get hard on those days sadly
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, well, hopefully you find a bit of time
 MSmits: I start a new course (as a student) the day after the contest starts
 ZarthaxX: yeah, i will jsut abandon my team for the subject proyect
 ZarthaxX: :D
 jacek: i actually never measured. i assume about 100-200x position vs the NN's number of weights
 MSmits: but I probably wont get much home work 
 ZarthaxX: MSmits nice timing
 MSmits: it's about game design
 MSmits: think they will make us do stuff in unity
 jacek: i think have about 52k weights for oware
 ZarthaxX: oh, why did you choose that?
 MSmits: what do you mean by 100-200 x position?
 Astrobytes: you'll walk that if it's Unity then MSmits
 MSmits: ZarthaxX not that much to choose from, other stuff would be more basic. At least game design sounds fun, i need some credits
 ZarthaxX: i see
 MSmits: yeah i used unity before
 MSmits: even went into their compute shader stuff
 MSmits: lots of tutorials too
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remember
 MSmits: it's a cool tool
 Astrobytes: And your sphere?
 jacek: nowadays i use somehwat supervised learning. i play random games, take out the position and let the current bot analyze for few depths for each of them
 Astrobytes: It was a sphere right
 ZarthaxX: you will be into gaming for 10 days then :P
 MSmits: oh that thing is still making me a euro a month":P
 MSmits: yeah a sphere
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: so for oware i can do 5 millions position and i think it will saturate it
 MSmits: I used the money for that useless D &amp;B paper
 jacek: :O
 jacek: hint: sci-hub, libgen
 ZarthaxX: D&amp;B&#160;?
 MSmits: nah this one was not available
 MSmits: had to spend $$
 MSmits: could not resist
 Astrobytes: oh didn't know libgen
 MSmits: dots and boxes ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: there is a paper for a game of cg?
 Astrobytes: we've got loads of board games now Zarthabsentee
 MSmits: umm, cg has checkers too
 ZarthaxX: i know Astrobytes it's too much :D
 MSmits: I think checkers has thousands of papers :P
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14979">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14979</a>
 MSmits: more citations because it's easier to find and read stuff?
 Astrobytes: Makes sense. Most big journals are only exploitative money making machines
 jacek: ZarthaxX its bit of experimentation and cg limits. there are 12 houses and 2 scores. 2 * (12 * 31 + 2 * 25) * HIDDEN_UNITS + HIDDEN_UNITS
 eulerscheZahl: and soon we'll have minesweeper
 MSmits: hmm jacek, have you not considered doing it scoreless&#160;?
 Astrobytes: that looks awesome btw euler, you did a great job on that&#160;:)
 jacek: nah
 MSmits: since the history of any gamestate has no effect on what the best move is
 ZarthaxX: jacek what are you talking about?
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. even got a win98VM and installed Netscape + WinRAR on it :D
 MSmits: so no matter what the score is, the best move is the smae
 MSmits: same
 Astrobytes: lol, now that's dedication! 
 MSmits: damn eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: couldn't find a way to go online with the VM
 jacek: ZarthaxX ahh you were talking to MSmits, sry
 eulerscheZahl: so i created an ISO file and inserted that
 ZarthaxX: okey haha
 ZarthaxX: optimization minesweeper toad?
 jacek: MSmits i want to keep it simple for now. game state -&gt; chance of winning. so far it works. if i get rekt, ill try another approach
 eulerscheZahl: medium puzzle
 ZarthaxX: oh ok
 MSmits: ah ok, sure chance of winning does need the score
 ZarthaxX: isn't there one already?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/55861285a82c4ae39d2abda5907c5d3cb39e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/55861285a82c4ae39d2abda5907c5d3cb39e</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: this actually explains something i found with your bot
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/minesweeper">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/minesweeper</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but mine has a working windows clock that shows the real time :D
 MSmits: I do a scoreless state, and your bot does sometimes do a different move if it came to the same state by a different route (with possibly a different score)
 ZarthaxX: how did you mix minesweeper with that interface wtf
 eulerscheZahl: you can turn it off, check the settings
 ZarthaxX: did you mimicate win98 game?
 eulerscheZahl: i took a screenshot from minesweeper on a Win98 and drew over it
 ZarthaxX: ah okey haha
 MSmits: MimicateMore than just mimicking someone. Greater than just imitating them.
 MSmits: had to urban this one
 MSmits: I thought you made it up
 ZarthaxX: i thought it existed :P
 MSmits: apparently it did
 Astrobytes: A case of mimesis
 jacek: mitochondrium is a powerhouse of the cell
 Astrobytes: lol, we need a dictionary of Zarth
 jacek: thank you, school
 Astrobytes: *mitochondrion
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: desoxyribonucleinacid
 MSmits: thanks Astrobytes, I'll correct the physics errors
 Astrobytes: *deoxyribonucleic acid
 MSmits: are we testing Astrobytes now
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: yes, autocorrect made that red. but failed to offer a better version
 MSmits: giraphe
 jacek: proffessor
 Astrobytes: haha I like giraphe better than giraffe
 MSmits: me too
 Astrobytes: professor
 MindController: Guys please help
 MindController: A.erase(A.begin() + 0);
 MindController: Im getting segmentation fault with this line
 eulerscheZahl: what's A.size()?
 MindController: 2
 eulerscheZahl: hm :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: you sure
 AntiSquid: besser = better btw :P
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see what could be wrong with this line then. maybe it segfaults somewhere else before?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get that AntiSquid. you are first only hit when I crtl#f for besser (and me now)
 eulerscheZahl: and we got a useless badge from the hacktober ctf
 Astrobytes: oh you did another ctf?
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't as fun as the first
 eulerscheZahl: but we learned that zeno is a great teammate for that kind of contest
 AntiSquid: what do you mean euler?
 eulerscheZahl: too windows heavy. and new tasks revealed late into the contest
 Astrobytes: that figures, he's good with numbers and crypto
 eulerscheZahl: and linux
 AntiSquid: ah yes that was bullshit :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh and the first questions that you had to answer to unlock the rest
 AntiSquid: 15:00 - 16:00 is when new puzzles got revealed
 eulerscheZahl: some research about the sponsors needed
 Astrobytes: eugh
 eulerscheZahl: how many core values does sponsor X list on the website, seriously?
 AntiSquid: reply challenge was really good imo
 Astrobytes: lol, that's really lame
 AntiSquid: some stuff annoyed me about reply, like the wording, but it was still far better
 eulerscheZahl: was only the first few. but already dropped my motivation when the real challenge started
 Astrobytes: was it just the 3 of you for reply or did Ille's colleague also join in the end?
 AntiSquid: this ctf seemed random, amateurishly organized
 eulerscheZahl: on paper ille too. but didn't play
 Astrobytes: why not?
 AntiSquid: zeno is really good at that stuff
 AntiSquid: he hard carried us
 eulerscheZahl: oh and the first hour the website was really laggy
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even see the tasks that zeno solved until the next day
 eulerscheZahl: went to bed and the next day some new tasks were there. and already solved
 AntiSquid: ya me and zeno stayed up and talked
 AntiSquid: was going to decompile a binary and zeno just ran a one-liner search on it to make it give him the flag ... lol
 eulerscheZahl: saw the chat the next day. but didn't read all of it as the tasks were solved
 AntiSquid: you know the flag3.txt challenge where i used the password to login to the other user? apparently you were supposed to find a file that has a permission to access the other user's file and run that on the flag3 lol
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/B34nB01z/writeups/tree/master/2020/Hacktober/Talking%20to%20the%20Dead%203">https://github.com/B34nB01z/writeups/tree/master/2020/Hacktober/Talking%20to%20the%20Dead%203</a>
 eulerscheZahl: ah, that's what I would have expected. some SUID or alike
 eulerscheZahl: you could write your own post mortem on that task
 AntiSquid: i did, a quick one for fun wanted to see if anyone comments / how they react
 eulerscheZahl: i see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ctftime.org/writeup/24264">https://ctftime.org/writeup/24264</a>
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i assumed you just set the username when connecting via ssh already
 AntiSquid: i connected without setting a username, there was none specified and i didn't even specify a port since -p 22 didn't work
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i thought it was ssh user@machinename
 eulerscheZahl: i logged in but just copied the details
 AntiSquid: i did ssh machinename 
 AntiSquid: that's the only thingi remember working
 eulerscheZahl: now it's offline already, can't even see the tasks anymore
 AntiSquid: or maybe we are talking about diff puzzles? either way the flag one went down for an hour
 AntiSquid: ya it's sad ... wonder what the 5k worth of points tasks even were
 eulerscheZahl: we are talking about the same task. but meh, let's end this discussion about a semi-interesting contest
 eulerscheZahl: back to watching last week tonight
 AntiSquid: reply was great, wanna try the investment challenge on their site, curious what it is about :D
 AntiSquid: oh shit . just remembered i signed up for the other challenge on sunday and didn't continue it LOL
 colinemonds: i hate it when you're one character behind on "shortest code" coc and the winner didn't share their code
 AntiSquid: why do they need to share if they don't want to&#160;?
 colinemonds: they don't have to
 colinemonds: i can hate things without hating the people
 Astrobytes: you can always pm them
 AntiSquid: pm them your hate
 Begalkantin: Gue baru belajar bang
 Astrobytes: lol, not quite what I had in mind
 Astrobytes: Ruthless mode today squiddy? :D
 Begalkantin: Hai dude
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN still afk
 Begalkantin: KOntol
 Astrobytes: Stop it Begalkantin
 Begalkantin: dddd
 Astrobytes: yes euler, appears so
 Astrobytes: Ooh I am being schooled in naughty Indonesian words in PM
 Astrobytes: Every day I learn
 eulerscheZahl: pay attention and use them for the next troll
 Begalkantin: NGENTOT MEMEK KONTOL BABI BANGSAT PILAT PELER ANJING TAI
 Astrobytes: ban next time
 eulerscheZahl: i get English insults in PM
 Astrobytes: lol
 programistination: wtf this website is full of bots
 Astrobytes: Yep. Especially the multiplayer section :P
 eulerscheZahl: in clash of code it's a replay of previous games from real humans
 programistination: wtf
 programistination: this is some number one BS
 Begalkantin: FUCK OFF ALL
 Begalkantin: HAHAHAHA
 eulerscheZahl: your turn again Astrobytes
 programistination: but this is some next level bs
 eulerscheZahl: banned *RIP*
 Astrobytes: There we go. Peace and quiet.
 programistination: I thought there are lots of ppl playing
 eulerscheZahl: well, do you want to wait 10min without anyone joining at bad times?
 programistination: yes
 programistination: remove the fucking bots
 Astrobytes: programistination: the bots only play when there aren't enough human players
 eulerscheZahl: the bots jump in to fill the gap and leave again if real players join
 programistination: ik
 programistination: but remove them
 programistination: xD
 programistination: jk
 eulerscheZahl: that would turn clashing into a single player game at some hours of the day
 Astrobytes: Which kind of defeats the purpose
 MadKnight: are u sure bots only play when not enough players&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there are some twitch streamers clashing. with lots of real players competing at the same time (around 50)
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure, it's what they said on the blog article right?
 Astrobytes: CG bots that is, I'm sure there are user bots too
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden/videos">https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden/videos</a>this one plays clash of code occasionally
 MSmits: so hey. What's the best way to serialize an array of 1249046562 ints
 MSmits: bytes i mean
 MSmits: or at least store them on HD in a readable way
 MSmits: (without decompressing the whole thing every time)
 Astrobytes: New optim game
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: also depends on your file system i think. how easy is it to access a random part of the file?
 MSmits: no i was talking about my oware seed db :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh, more insults in the private messages
 eulerscheZahl: all caps now
 Astrobytes: lol, the anger is real
 MSmits: what did you do eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: I know MSmits!
 eulerscheZahl: kick
 eulerscheZahl: and astro went for the ban after
 MSmits: that hurts, you play soccer
 Astrobytes: He got 3 kicks and a ban
 MSmits: teamwork
 eulerscheZahl: by 3 different mods
 eulerscheZahl: do i want to *** his ***?
 MSmits: is this Begalkantin?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: And we're learning Indonesian words
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: so you used him for his knowledge and then discarded him?
 Astrobytes: Hmm, he kind of bestowed the knowledge upon us without our consent
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: sometimes you don't know what you're missing until it's handed to you
 Astrobytes: I think I know enough to get beaten up by strangers in Indonesia now
 MSmits: sounds useful
 Astrobytes: #lifegoals
 MSmits: we all have our bucketlist i guess
 Astrobytes: back to your issue, is it not easier to store in an actual database? OR that's too slow?
 Astrobytes: Also are you serialising it by hand currently or using an inbuilt feature?
 colinemonds: I mean, "serializing" a bucket of bytes literally just means taking it as it is
 colinemonds: so what's wrong with just calling open() and spitting it all out
 colinemonds: databases, sheesh! bac 
 colinemonds: back in the day we had to hand-roll our floppy drivers
 colinemonds: barefoot and uphill, both ways
 Astrobytes: don't worry, MSmits loves doing things like that
 MSmits: colinemonds thats exactly what i need
 MSmits: but i also need to be able to go into that file and retrieve a byte at a specific position
 MSmits: not sure what this open() thing is though
 MSmits: a value will use 6 bits, so i will retrieve two consequtive bytes actually and take part of each
 MSmits: consecutive
 MSmits: i think?
 MSmits: Astrospelling?
 Astrobytes: second is correct yes
 MSmits: kk
 Astrobytes: "astrospelling" lol
 MSmits: hey i figured I'd weigh in on that thing you got going with scartaxX
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: but glad to hear it's possible to put data on disk like that
 Scarfield: its a beautiful thing AstroSmits
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: indeed Mfield
 MSmits: that sounds like what euler is working on
 MSmits: either that or something out of string theory
 eulerscheZahl: huh, what am I working on?
 MSmits: minesweeper
 Astrobytes: I was gonna say it defo has a theoretical physics sound to it
 MSmits: yeah 
 eulerscheZahl: ah. only 1 vote missing
 colinemonds: well, 6/8 at least lines up every QWORD, so you can process it in blocks of that size if you want (and it's easy to calculate indices)
 eulerscheZahl: and then level 54 :boom:
 Scarfield: i can be "persuaded"
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: colinemonds i dont mind if it is hard to calculate indices. These files are going to be 2GB each and I need 100 of them 
 MSmits: roughly, but you get the idea
 MSmits: dont want it to be 33% bigger 
 colinemonds: sure, but well, if you need to get it as efficiently as possible (and do care about order/need to access by index), then just bit-shifting to proper positions is the way to go. you're advantage here is that because it naturally lines up, even the perfect packing isn't annoying to implement
 MSmits: ah yeah, that's true, if I ever stop using it and want to keep it around I could pack it
 Scarfield: I like your profile euler, you pretty much have everything and then:"SKILLSNo skills learned yet"
 colinemonds: *your. also, because the indices are easily calculated, you could keep the values even in-memory like this, and processing will probably still be reasonably performant, depending on what you do (will probably hit memory bandwidth limits before the CPU is busy with packing/unpacking)
 MSmits: mmh ok, but say I am using an array of bytes (is this char? or uint8_t?), how would i go about writing it to file and reading parts of it?
 MSmits: which c++ functions are these
 MSmits: most of the stuff i find are about reading and writing strings
 colinemonds: hah, that would actually be a nice coc challenge! 
 MSmits: I often write an integer to file in hex format or something, but that's pretty silly
 colinemonds: it's conceptually very simple: the first byte you write is (values[0] &lt;&lt; 2 | values[1] &gt;&gt; 6)
 MSmits: yeah no i got that part
 MSmits: the bit shifting and such
 colinemonds: then i don't understand your question
 MSmits: how do i write it
 colinemonds: ohhhhh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits it's just how you open the file
 MSmits: yeah i should explain, i am a bit wizard that does not half of programming basics that real devs take for granted :P
 MSmits: does not understand
 colinemonds:    ofstream writestream("file.bin", ios::out | ios::binary);
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: ahh thats the stuff
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/</a>&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Honestly MSmits, you could just have asked that a day ago lol
 MSmits: i only thought of the question today
 MSmits: because i had that new idea
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 MSmits: hmm but scarfield, thats plain string writing
 MSmits: characters
 colinemonds: it's the same concept, you just have to pass the binary flag
 MSmits: I am learning how to write binary now
 MSmits: yeah apparently
 colinemonds: characters == bytes as far as C and C++ are concerned
 MSmits: cool, thanks
 colinemonds: it's a wrong assumption, but it made sense in the 70s
 Scarfield: yea, just realised. your avatar should have a wizard hat with ones and zeros on it, instead of moons and stars :p
 AntiSquid: how many decades have you been coding for colinemonds
 MSmits: not a bad idea Scarfield
 colinemonds: not as many as Dennis Ritchie, which is also why I don't sneer at decisions like that in retrospect&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: good answer&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: only now realized he has a degree in physics . 
 AntiSquid: need a degree in physics to get better at coding i guess
 MSmits: physicists end up all over the place
 Thecodekid123: v = 6                                                           c = 90                                                                 answer = v + c                                               print(answer)                                               -                                                                      96        
 MSmits: mostly it's a degree that says: smart guy
 AntiSquid: humblebrag
 MSmits: or gal
 MSmits: it's true though, at one point we had 5 guys with physics degrees in or parliament
 Thecodekid123: AntiSquid how have you been doc?
 MSmits: our
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Physicists wear several hats usually named i j k
 AntiSquid: alright . i wish i could say great but yeah . how's it going Thecodekid123 already forgot when we last talked .
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII lol... I always make loops with i,j,k I think you're referring to tensor geometry?
 AntiSquid: how do i access my digitial memory again&#160;? (someone share the link to the CG chat history please lol)
 Thecodekid123: Me great I am learning Python for now.Thanks for asking AntiSquid.:sunglasses:
 MSmits: isnt that just google?
 MSmits: AntiSquid?
 colinemonds: coc etiquette question: is googling for a mathematical formula allowed?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits my physics classes were all about how general formulas were made, so yea i,j,k unit vectors
 LegendaryStone: DiL can you share code please, you never do and I want to learn 
 LegendaryStone: :pensive:
 AntiSquid: yes ofc . colinemonds
 s0m3th1ng: Wassup everyone, this is my first time doing this
 colinemonds: great, thank you
 Astrobytes: googling for anything is allowed in CoC
 Thecodekid123: a = b                                                                     b = 'idk'                                                             print(a)                                                              -                                                                       idk
 MSmits: oh right yeah that's just linear algebra. I think it's a class many CS students dislike
 colinemonds: including just the solution? hah
 s0m3th1ng: are you guys in high school or college?
 colinemonds: I guess that's the world we live in now
 AntiSquid: i mean if you ever do coders strike back i don't know how you progress without checking trigo formulas 
 Astrobytes: People do that sadly
 MSmits: s0m3th1ng that and more
 s0m3th1ng: oh- okay
 MSmits: I am both in high school and college and I have a job, how about that
 colinemonds: AntiSquid I meant fastest mode in particular, not any of the bot challengs or puzzles
 s0m3th1ng: wow
 colinemonds: for those it's obviously ok
 MSmits: high school is my job, so i am cheating I guess
 Astrobytes: No it's fine in all CoC modes
 colinemonds: cool
 Thecodekid123: Guys and Gals you can try to code in python here:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jupyter.org/try">https://jupyter.org/try</a>
 AntiSquid: colinemonds you save solutions for the puzzles you've done and paste them next time you get them, coc repeats itself
 colinemonds: I guess if I had just spent the time working the formula myself instead of chatting, I would have had it by now, so I also don't feel bad about it anymore
 MSmits: *try* to code sounds a bit offensive :P
 Astrobytes: s0m3th1ng: a lot of us here are old
 AntiSquid: and people share the code . i mean ...
 colinemonds: that's really lame, no?
 colinemonds: seems like it defeats the entire purpose
 AntiSquid: how else do you want to beat the 10 second guys&#160;?
 Astrobytes: tis what it is
 colinemonds: I didn't have any 10 second people so far
 MSmits: colinemonds you need to do a lot of clashes before you see repeats
 MSmits: most people get tired of it before that
 eulerscheZahl: more than 600 clashes in the pool
 MSmits: most people switch to stuff that is more fun
 AntiSquid: oh number increased a lot i see
 s0m3th1ng: Astrobytes how old?
 AntiSquid: * meaningful @MSmits
 Astrobytes: MSmits is 128, I'm 38, there are others
 codeing: yo the city
 MSmits: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: smits is -128, he had an overflow
 codeing: i'm doing something
 codeing: like
 MSmits: wouldnt that be -127?
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 codeing:    *   
 AntiSquid: hi codeine nice to see you pal
 s0m3th1ng: how is MSmits 128
 eulerscheZahl: 127+1 = -128
 MSmits: mmh ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: in 2's complement at least
 codeing: yo
 s0m3th1ng: I'm only 18 
 codeing: let me ask please something
 codeing: thanks
 codeing: i'm doing something
 codeing: and i have question for you
 Astrobytes: He likes bits s0m3th1ng, and doesn't know his own age so you can just suggest one
 codeing: this is the algo
 MSmits: s0m3th1ng we have 13 yr olds that wreck people at coding here. Age doesn't matter that much
 s0m3th1ng: okay
 Astrobytes: yep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in 8 days my age will start with a 5, proof of garbage in garbage out GIGO
 codeing: what you think about this code&#160;?
 AntiSquid: who is that MSmits&#160;? :P#
 codeing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wtools.io/paste-code/b2rs">https://wtools.io/paste-code/b2rs</a>

 MSmits: i think?
 AntiSquid: is he 13&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yep
 MSmits: I thought so, might have the name confused
 Astrobytes: He is 143
 Astrobytes: I mean 13
 Astrobytes: lol
 codeing: any feedback
 AntiSquid: lies, too good for 13 .
 MSmits: euler confused you with the overflow joke isnt he
 MSmits: didnt he
 Astrobytes: Nice kid. I taught him minimax
 MSmits: he learns too fast

 PatrickMcGinnisII: imagine being young during AlphaGo
 Astrobytes: I know right
 MSmits: we're all young compared to Alpha go though
 MSmits: dont they all say it's like 30000 hrs old
 MSmits: the articles
 colinemonds: is that a lot of hours? doesn't feel like a lot of hours
 MSmits: yeah its just 5 yrs
 MSmits: maybe its 30000 lifetimes i dunno
 MSmits: in any case, they always talk about huge trainign times
 colinemonds: imagine playing go against yourself for 30,000 lifetimes
 colinemonds: a special kind of hell
 MSmits: i dont even want to play it once :P
 MSmits: at least against myself i'd win 50%, thats something
 Allis: We know not what we sow.
 Allis: The robots will have a hard time forgiving us.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i had to ride my 10 speed 13 miles each way in 100 degree heat to copy an ascii table from the library, true story .&#160;:(
 MSmits: i know. It's somewhere between 1 and 48 seeds
 Astrobytes: Heretic MSmits
 AntiSquid: if you count training time as age they are all millions of years old :P
 Allis: @PatrickMcGinnisII What an adventure!
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and now tell the same story again with metric units so the rest of us can understand what you are talking about PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: about 20km
 colinemonds: what's a ten speed though
 MSmits: I am assuming it was hot, he went far and he copied the same database multiple times because he kept losing it on the way back
 eulerscheZahl: the 100 degree was the hard part for me actually
 Astrobytes: 30+ degrees
 Astrobytes: nearer 40 I guess
 eulerscheZahl: that's hot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 10 speed, lol... it had gears
 AntiSquid: 10 gears?
 Astrobytes: Ain't any of you used a proper bicycle?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 in front, 5 in back..c'mon 2x5=10
 AntiSquid: never drove a care with 10
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Actually the one I have now is 18
 AntiSquid: not very knowlegable with cars actually
 colinemonds: I repaired my bicycle yesterday. The light didn't work because the cable broke, so I wrapped bell wire around and affixed it with alligator clamps
 colinemonds: Most gangster shit on the bloc
 MSmits: why are you focused on the bike. I am more interested in why he had to copy an ascii table multiple times
 AntiSquid: i mean 7 seems enough
 Astrobytes: hahaha now that's a proper repair job
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just once, there was no internet!  Had to trek to even have a possibility of finding an answer
 MSmits: ahhh ok
 AntiSquid: oh you were talking about bikes lol
 MSmits: you're like those third world people that have to walk 2 hrs for water. Only it's worse in your case. Ascii tables should be available to all
 Astrobytes: brb, founding an NGO for ascii tables
 colinemonds: that's America's main two cultural exports, democracy and the ASCII table
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they didn't really start publishing personal computer books til like '79
 colinemonds: yeah I figured this story had probably happened before the internet haha
 epinephrine: :nerd:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unless you had a magazine subscription to microcomputer magazine you had no info at all
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII is an OG
 colinemonds: although tbh, if you knew what an ASCII table is and why you would need one, couldn't you just have ran the equivalent of for(i=1;i&lt;256;++i) { printf("%c", i); } on your machine?
 Astrobytes: Original [Mc]Ginnis
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i built my own computer and burnt my own EPROMs, yall are spoiled
 colinemonds: ohh. yeah in that case
 MSmits: no doubt PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: ^this is the man I keep trying to convince to use C instead of PHP on here
 MSmits: yeah this is inconsistent
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes rofl
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm burntout
 MSmits: because of the eproms?
 Astrobytes: all in the head brother, all in the head
 <b>**MSmits googles eproms</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> colinemonds: speaking of which, why is there no "6502 Assembly" option
 AntiSquid: great now try a quantum computer
 AntiSquid: patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Imagine trying to make the leap from ASM to OOP, you'd fry your braincells too
 Astrobytes: there was a suggestion for ARM assembly in the language thread colinemonds, that's as far as it goes
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII the reverse leap might be worse?
 colinemonds: shhh, nobody mention FP to Patrick now
 MSmits: FP is quite old isn't it?
 Astrobytes: yeah but it's trendy now
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum">https://www.codingame.com/forum</a>
 eulerscheZahl: wtf
 Astrobytes: just saw that
 eulerscheZahl: vandalism approval
 Astrobytes: no, some are old puzzles
 Astrobytes: they might be linking those without threads
 eulerscheZahl: ah, that would explain it. and i like that explanation more
 MSmits: a community bot?
 MSmits: Thi baud handing off his job to a machine&#160;?
 jacek: FP?
 eulerscheZahl: the bot creates threads for new puzzles
 Astrobytes: it's the one that links a forum topic to a puzzle or multi MSmits
 MSmits: ah
 eulerscheZahl: i thought someone just approved 7 at once
 Astrobytes: damn you :P
 colinemonds: I reached Gold league on Coders Strike Back yesterday and I felt so betrayed
 colinemonds: for the entire lower leagues, you never get the full layout of the map including all checkpoints
 MSmits: we all feel your pain colinemonds
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's a bit of a kick in the teeth
 MSmits: other multis are not like that
 colinemonds: so I felt super smart when I constructed them in-memory to optimize turns for the later laps... 
 colinemonds: oh, I'm not alone
 colinemonds: well then
 MSmits: for a long time we gave people a heuristic just to get them into the higher leagues so they get all the info
 MSmits: we stopped doing that because its a bit counterproductive to learning 
 Astrobytes: Now we mostly encourage the slow way
 colinemonds: it seems like it wouldn't hurt to just give all the checkpoints from Wood league onwards, though
 colinemonds: people can just ignore them if they don't care
 MSmits: yeah, thats how other multis work generally
 AntiSquid: go for legend in CSB since you get another rule change and need to optimize again
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It's very old though, as M Smits said it's better for other multis 
 colinemonds: really? gah
 MSmits: isnt it just a speed increase?
 MSmits: to legend?
 AntiSquid: double speed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: FP written in GNU C, oic ... damn rabbit hole colinemonds damn u
 MSmits: dont worry about that colinemonds
 MSmits: speed is just a number
 AntiSquid: small change huge effect
 MSmits: all other multis afaik, have their last rule change at bronze
 MSmits: and when the rules change, its usually a good thing, to slowly let you get into the game
 MSmits: with csb it's counterproductive
 colinemonds: well I thought about re-writing everything for gold anyway, because currently I barely have an AI algorithm, I just do simple linear algebra to optimize the turn for the next checkpoint and otherwise I just follow the track
 Astrobytes: contests can vary, as it's obviously a dynamic thing but ultimately ends up as last changes in bronze
 PatrickMcGinnisII: How to make me shutup, make me curious enough to google something
 MSmits: colinemonds if you want to get into csb seriously, you need to write a search algorithm
 colinemonds: FP in C is not considerably more insane than OOP in C, and people do the latter
 colinemonds: so hey
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII you never heard of functional programming until now?
 MSmits: minimax, ga, etc.
 colinemonds: yeah, I figured I'd try Minimax with a-b pruning first and see how that goes
 MSmits: it works, many bots have it
 MSmits: the top 5 are neural networks, but dont let that discourage you
 AntiSquid: isn't it just about the MCTS these days&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes not as an actual lang.
 MSmits: NNs on CG are beatable in most cases, some are just very strong. The codesize limits heavily restricts them
 colinemonds: how do you even use neural networks on codingame? do they just bring their own evaluator?
 MSmits: you have to write everything yourself
 MSmits: and fit it into the codesize
 colinemonds: yeah that's what I figured
 AntiSquid: through suffering
 MSmits: not many games have them though
 MSmits: a few boardgames and csb and bitrunner2k I think
 colinemonds: it just becomes an exercise in Kolmogorov-complexity at that point
 colinemonds: find an NN that plays well *and also compresses well*
 jacek: and unicode
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I haven't done nN on CG, don't you have to give it baby steps on local sim first?
 MSmits: ahh good old Kolmogorov
 <b>**MSmits googles Kolmogorov</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: hehehe
 jacek: you train NN offline and just put weights in the code
 BuonOmo: Anyone got stuck at 93% on the chess board analyzer with all tests passing&#160;?
 jacek: cute cat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BuonOmo I'm kinda working on it now
 Astrobytes: Nope, I'm at 0%, no tests passing, 0 attempts
 Astrobytes: :P
 Gabbek: BuonOmo - finished it around 10min, all passed.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: haven't tried to submit yet
 Gabbek: You're most likely having issue with capturing.
 MSmits: oh PatrickMcGinnisII. NN's are your way to get a rank 1 using php language
 MSmits: do it&#160;:)
 BuonOmo: So frustrating, i've taken some shortcuts (like a rook can see even if there is a pawn in the way). But idk which one is an issue...
 BuonOmo: @Gabbek don't think so!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I like graphics tho, I'd hate to have to write a java app to run a php code, how rude\
 colinemonds: just call Vulkan API from PHP via FFI
 Astrobytes: that would be interesting
 colinemonds: "An attacked King could be saved only by moving himself to a safe square (not by using another piece from the King's team)" makes the puzzle kinda lame, like, the entire puzzle is really just "write a chess evaluator", but then it's really "write a chess evaluator that doesn't even work"
 L810: can someone send me the solution to the game: Don't Panic episode 1 in C coding
 Astrobytes: No L810
 colinemonds: really, at least google it yourself!
 colinemonds: kids these days!
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 L810: why not lmao. i did google it first
 MSmits: you're supposed to code it
 Astrobytes: You're kinda missing the point
 Scarfield: ^
 Astrobytes: If you can't do it, figure it out
 MSmits: ask for a hint
 MSmits: astro is always happy to help
 L810: its an assignment... not by choice
 colinemonds: hah, that's what I thought
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: gee thanks MSmits
 MSmits: :P
 Scarfield: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: vulcan google hole... got me again.  supported by my graphics card and my PHP cli ... huh, how did i not know this?
 Astrobytes: L810 you will learn nothing in this course/class if you go around asking for solutions to problems
 ZarthaxX: L810 keep asking for solutions, that's the way to go
 MSmits: :vulcan:
 ZarthaxX: im the devil here astrobyto
 eulerscheZahl: no, you are the polar bear
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess i can throw netbeans out
 eulerscheZahl: and replace it with IntelliJ?
 LastRick: I don't need the solutions, just the validators
 colinemonds: PatrickMcGinnisII well, setting up Vulkan to the point where it renders a triangle is just a thousand lines or so of boilerplate, so I think it will still look better than most PHP code I've seen
 colinemonds: I'd say go for it
 Astrobytes: lol ZarthaxX :imp:
 colinemonds: LastRick right, NN is going to put us all out of a job
 Astrobytes: colinemonds hahahaha
 LastRick: yep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: colinemonds well i actually do alpha channel blending in php, not animated of course, but it works really well
 Neumann: wlesavo: you're using vanilla Beam Search on 2048&#160;? It fascinates me how poorly my Beam Search performs, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
 Astrobytes: Neumann strongly on topic here :P
 Neumann: Oh I'm sorry I thought this was internet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: All the top 10 peepz are hard-wire focused
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: I was only joking btw
 AntiSquid: are we discussing manga&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Nope. Sushi recipes
 Neumann: I know :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, i don't get forum notifications but i get CoC ones, gheesh
 eulerscheZahl: defending your rank on the optim leaderboard or are you interested in 2048 for real?
 Neumann: Why not both
 eulerscheZahl: ok, that's cool&#160;:)
 Neumann: I'm trying to convince myself I'm not that rusty after a few months off of CG
 Neumann: But my struggles are proving me wrong
 Neumann: Also first time I'm implementing Beam Search
 Neumann: And legit not understanding why it sucks so hard
 wlesavo: Neumann some tuning, but i also struggled a lot finding good parameters, also acounting for duplicates gives a huge boost
 MSmits: hey Astrobytes, my 8 seed db went from 300 ms to 150 ms using the new order of calculation (better caching). Now I am going to try it for 9 seeds. I have good hope I can keep it under 1 second
 Neumann: What is there to tune besides the beam width&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there are that many duplicates? i didn't expect that
 Neumann: Currently at width 1000 with snake eval -&gt;10M
 wlesavo: basically it worked much worse then my BF at first, i even thought i broked my sim at some point, but it was just the parameters
 colinemonds: ESL question: how do you call one square on a chess board?
 wlesavo: yes euler. i didnt checked how much, but quite a lot
 Neumann: Parameters, with a S. brb reading Beam Search definition because I can only see 1 parameter
 colinemonds: a square? tile? checker-thing?
 wlesavo: Neumann i have smth like depth 50 width 30
 Neumann: tf
 eulerscheZahl: that's almost like my params :rofl:
 MSmits: yay, 9 seed db:  Endbook time: 336 ms
 eulerscheZahl: and a similar Neumann reaction to it
 MSmits: I can do 10 I think
 wlesavo: Neumann also there are some differences in approaches, i for example do fixed depth fixed print depth, some people try to search for the whole turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: All programmers have performance anxiety it seems
 Westicles: I'm a little surprised how hard these 131k tiles are to find offline.  Still stuck at 4
 wlesavo: im at 4 with online solution, magaiti even have offline reverse sim, and even that struggles, i wonder what dbdr did, he was quite fast to achieve that score also
 Westicles: Which 4?  If you call them 0-29, I have 4,6,15,22
 wlesavo: let me check
 wlesavo: oh wait, im at 5, 3 4 6 15 22
 Westicles: aha, thanks I'll look into those more
 wlesavo: also i believe 6 is easiest to achieve 3.3M
 Westicles: I don't have any good ideas besides trying the 8 snake rotations.  Maybe there is another closed path besides the snake that works
 Westicles: Doing reverse sounds interesting though
 Neumann: wlesavo: depth 50 width 30 takes 2ms max. I must be doing something else than a BeamSearch
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a BF at 6 depth only gets you 1M, a BF at 5 depth, and expanding top 75% scorers to 2 more depths gave me 1.5M . I'm so out of my depth, pun intended
 Westicles: All I do is depth 7 from scratch every turn, no beam
 PatrickMcGinnisII: max tile 8192 at depth 7 imho
 Westicles: Nope.  1.6-1.74M for every case, but no 131k
 Neumann: So you print 7 moves per turn&#160;?
 Westicles: Oh, no I meant I search 7 moves into the fugure
 Westicles: future
 Astrobytes: MSmits: sorry was afk, that's quite the improvement!!
 Westicles: I print whenever chrono hits 50ms
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl i will always be the polar bear 
 Neumann: Ok, like wlesavo did. Depth 7, keep best, depth 7 from that one, etc for 50ms
 ZarthaxX: need to put some horns in my polar bear and a trident or smth
 Westicles: right
 Neumann: That approach gives me 24M&#160;:/
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only kept 1?
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: put an unpopular opinion on your profile pic and you can be a polarising bear
 Scarfield: bipolar bear?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes or add sunglasses
 Astrobytes: true
 ZarthaxX: wtf :rofl:
 DejaVu_081: hi
 Westicles: Ah, yurk posted his scores
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/52fA4eJ6">https://pastebin.com/52fA4eJ6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: will this turn into the next Great Dispatch with top players getting a perfect score?
 colinemonds: what puzzle are you discussing?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048</a>
 colinemonds: oh, it's yours, cool
 eulerscheZahl: i was a little spammy with contributions :innocent:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damnit, 10 minutes to figure out i forgot to put __ in front of construct
 colinemonds: is 2048 even solvable from every starting position/random seed? 
 eulerscheZahl: if you are really unlucky with the spawns probably not
 eulerscheZahl: but in this version you have the spawn algo as well. so you can actively influence the next spawn
 eulerscheZahl: the drawbacks of an interpreted language PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is it bad that i only put solutions in OOP to make it readable?
 colinemonds: is it bad that my solution for the puzzle I'm working on has some functions that are over a screen page long and are really just the same block copy-pasted a dozen times because I'm lazy and nobody will maintain this anyway?
 colinemonds: ... probably yes
 Astrobytes: that happens
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, most puzzles r like 100 lines max, maybe a couple harder ones at 400
 MSmits: astrobytes, yeah it was nice. Then I did 10 seeds and i got just over 1s. Looking for a few more improvements now and otherwise I'll just code my "continue into regular turns" thingy
 Astrobytes: I think you're on the right path MSmits
 MSmits: yeah, I hope this is done soon, then i'll look into doing it locally
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u stil fighting bandas?
 MSmits: nah this is oware
 Astrobytes: (hence my interest)
 MSmits: i generate endgame books so that i can immediately give a W/L/D result when it goes below 11 seeds on the board
 MSmits: i do this in the first 1s mostly. It's not put into codesize
 eulerscheZahl: joke's on you: you'll beat me like 20-3
 MSmits: lol 
 MSmits: the thing that took 70% of my calc time now due to caching only takes 15% now
 MSmits: funny how changing the order of operations can make such a big difference
 Astrobytes: that really is an impressive result
 ZarthaxX: what
 Astrobytes: nothing, shuddup :P
 MSmits: i sped up my endgame book generation by doing things in a different order. By a factor of 3 or so
 MSmits: 2-3
 MSmits: thats what happens if you make a huge 100 mb array and you decide  to think about caching instead of just accessing it all over the place
 MSmits: i shudder to think of how badly my mcts sometimes caches with all that tree reuse
 MSmits: though i guess the nodes could still be close somehow, not sure, it's messy
 ZarthaxX: i said what because i didnt get what he changed for the cache friendly thing :P
 Astrobytes: yeah yeah :P
 ZarthaxX: ban astro
 <b>**Astrobytes hides</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: oh ok, well i was accessing things in a way where they were on average 180 times farther apart than they are now
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: good catch :P
 MSmits: because i sorted by state instead of by gameturn
 MSmits: each state has a value for each game turn
 MSmits: but i only need the previous turn
 ZarthaxX: ah nice haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dropping 14 ints in a stack sounds faster to me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: says the 1 depth oware bot
 Astrobytes: hey i'm 0 depth
 MSmits: mmh not the same :P
 Scarfield: oof the puns, must resist
 Astrobytes: shhh
 Astrobytes: lol punfield
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII thinks Astro is scarred</b></p><p><img src="/a/22238461634817" /> Scarfield: 14 ints vs 100Mb array, potato potato
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he can still hash each node and sort it all out after
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe drop a radix sort on it.  3 loops and call it done
 PatrickMcGinnisII: isn't treeing the entire oware doable?  Maybe not booking it for CG, but the expansion isn't infinite ...maybe big...
 MSmits: yeah it is
 MSmits: needs 200 TB or at least something of that order
 MSmits: that's an upper limit
 MSmits: actually
 MSmits: thats the statecount
 MSmits: the treesize is waayyyyy bigger 
 MSmits: transpositions keep the statecount low, so solving it is doable
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 200TB, seriously ... i may have to investigate this, but I never finished my oware
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII adds to his to-do list</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: It's a rabbit hole
 Astrobytes: A good one though
 MSmits: i can probably take a guess at the solving time by a quick calc
 MSmits: assuming 10 seeds is 1 second
 MSmits: gimme a min
 MSmits: it would take about 500 hours on a single core, assuming the same cache efficiency. Considering that you would, at some point need to keep 100 trillion states in quick memory all at once. That is not realistic
 MSmits: so 500 hrs * whatever penalty due to cache inefficiency/using HD
 MSmits: parallizing it is completely doable though
 MSmits: but the cache problem is not gonna go away 
 MSmits: parallelizing, what a crapp word this is
 Excetra: Bruh I'm level 3 on this thing and I haven't even got more than 0% on any of thenm
 Astrobytes: you forgot to trigger your astrospeller MSmits
 MSmits: yeah sorry
 Excetra: I'm so bad at this
 MSmits: at coding?
 Excetra: well yeah
 Excetra: I just don't understand any of the clashofcode things, and when I do I can't do it
 MSmits: do some basic coding tutorials first. Python is probably a good idea
 MSmits: nah dont start with clash really
 Excetra: Yeah, I'm learning python
 Astrobytes: and do puzzles, not clashes
 Excetra: I'm not like a total total beginner, but I am a beginner
 MSmits: you dont need a time limit when you're still learning
 Excetra: where can I do the puzzles?
 MSmits: practice
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Excetra: Thankyou&#160;:)
 MSmits: there is a difference between the difficulty of the easy puzzles though
 MSmits: if something is still out of reach, try a different one
 MSmits: they're not that well categorized
 Excetra: Alright, I'll have a look, thanks for both of your help
 MSmits: np
 Astrobytes: yeah, the CG official ones are better (they have graphics)
 Astrobytes: And you can ask in chat or check the forum for tips
 Excetra: alrighty
 MSmits: then
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: that was... Ace Ventura or the Mask?
 MSmits: i think ace ventura
 MSmits: but was split between that and cable guy, dont remember
 Astrobytes: k, I trust you, been a while
 Astrobytes: No defo not cable guy
 MSmits: yeah just checked
 MSmits: its ace ventura
 Astrobytes: ah cool
 LastRick: also ace ventura 2, don't forget that masterpiece
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Can't remember if I watched it or not
 LastRick: Do you recall any jokes about bat guano? Then no.
 Excetra: Wow this is difficult
 Astrobytes: It's a no from me
 Astrobytes: Anyway, Cable Guy and Truman Show were probably my favourite Carrey films tbh
 LastRick: Those were good too, def different from Ace. But my vote would be Eternal Sunshine or Man on the Moon
 Excetra: Is there anywhere where I can find the answer to the question, because I'm really confused
 LastRick: depends on the question
 Astrobytes: Oh damn, forgot about Eternal Sunshine, that was a great film
 MSmits: yeah i liked that
 Excetra: It's on puzzles: it's called descnet
 Excetra: The descent
 Astrobytes: there's a button on the left with Hints
 LastRick: the descent
 Excetra: ah ok
 LastRick: yeah, i think most of us have done it, what's the problem
 MSmits: one of the hints should be that there's a button on the left with Hints
 LastRick: hah
 Astrobytes: But I'd urge you to think through what the problem is that you're trying to solve
 Astrobytes: lol yeah
 Excetra: alright i'll have a try
 Astrobytes: write it down on paper/whiteboard
 colinemonds: is The Descent the one with the mountains? that one reminded me a lot of maths problems in middle school
 Excetra: yes it is the one about mountains
 Astrobytes: yeah that's the one
 colinemonds: "Two trains from Chicago and Washington are moving at each other at a speed of 40 mph. They pass by a train station that's at a distance of 20 miles to Washington and 1000 miles to Chicago. How old is the storekeeper?"
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: 5 tomatoes
 LastRick: The doctor was his mom!
 Astrobytes: 42
 PatrickMcGinnisII: colinemonds well if they pass a station while moving at each other, the storekeeper is probably dead
 Excetra: so the answer has the while loop as: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/df447bee-e06f-4778-a1f5-e0e0db1b03ba">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/df447bee-e06f-4778-a1f5-e0e0db1b03ba</a>
 Excetra: wat
 Excetra: while 1:
 Excetra: is what i was meant to say idk why it did that
 Excetra: i just wanted to know what while 1: means
 Astrobytes: white True
 Astrobytes: *while True
 Astrobytes: 1 is true
 Astrobytes: it's an infinite loop
 Excetra: oh right ok 
 Astrobytes: so while true is always true, do this stuff
 Excetra: so if it was while 0: it would mean while false
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: it means while false is true
 MSmits: so, never
 Excetra: oh lol
 Astrobytes: hehe, easy trap to fall into
 Excetra: yeah this answer confuses me, and it's on the easy section... i'll try another question
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: dont worry about the while thing though
 MSmits: i didnt understand it at first either and i could solve a few puzzles before i did
 MSmits: to me it just meant, thats the puzzle loop in which the logic goes
 MSmits: it's a game loop basically
 MSmits: they are always infinite until some thingy breaks out of it
 Excetra: right
 Astrobytes: for puzzles look at it as while there's all the input, keep doing stuff with it
 Excetra: It's getting late anyway, I should probably head off for the night. Thanks for your help guys
 Astrobytes: when you output at the end, it stops
 Astrobytes: no problem
 Excetra: have a nice evening&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: and you
 Sepehr.khashei: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
 MSmits: Astrobytes is not *that* funny 
 Astrobytes: It's true&#160;:(
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 MSmits: I meant you are very funny, but with a few extra O's of course
 MSmits: few less i mean
 Astrobytes: Obviously :P
 MSmits: there's too many O's is what I'm saying
 Astrobytes: Sepehr.khashei: explain your outburst of laughter
 MSmits: what a lazy troll, just one spam message
 Astrobytes: I know, zero fun
 MSmits: yeah he had lots of zero's and 2 L's
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 MSmits: hey the level of intelligence goes down closer to midnight
 MSmits: also i am sleep deprived, had to work this morning and i was a week off
 Astrobytes: this is true
 MSmits: my sleep cycle gets messed up
 Astrobytes: I don't even know what my sleep cycle is these days lol
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense in your situation, sucks
 Astrobytes: Multiple reasons, not just that tbh
 Astrobytes: MAd year
 MSmits: because of covid?
 Astrobytes: weird work schedules etc
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: oh about covid... I went to a wedding a week ago and now the bride is fevered coughing and waiting for test result
 Astrobytes: you were masked up right
 MSmits: glad I didn't go to the afterparty
 MSmits: i was very careful
 MSmits: they had like 10-20 people in a house
 Astrobytes: I mask up everywhere
 MSmits: afterwards
 MSmits: i didnt go there
 Astrobytes: oh ffs, that's just stupid
 MSmits: yeah, I know, that's why i didnt go
 Astrobytes: The stupidity never fails to amaze me, problem is the rest of us feel the consequences of it
 MSmits: wasnt just stupid, also illegal, but my country is not so big on enforcement
 MSmits: rules lately got a lot stricter btw
 Astrobytes: It's kinda hard to enforce some of the regulations without being fascist, it's a thin line
 MSmits: all bars/cafe/restaurants are closed
 Astrobytes: yeah same in my region of Scotland
 MSmits: masks will soon be mandatory everywhere
 MSmits: but you see them a lot already
 Astrobytes: Have you seen the situation even just around Europe?
 MSmits: just around?
 Astrobytes: just Europe, not counting the rest of the world
 MSmits: ah yeah, the second wave was very well predicted
 MSmits: our politicians screwed up this time though
 MSmits: first time they did ok
 MSmits: they acted too late
 Astrobytes: (sorry, typing in a conversational  Scottish way :P )
 Astrobytes: Same across Europe
 MSmits: I'll gie ye a skelpit lug
 Astrobytes: HAHAHA
 MSmits: I'm fast with google :P
 Astrobytes: whaur'd ye pu' that wan fi?
 Astrobytes: ah
 Sepehr.khashei: just want to say something&#160;:)
 MSmits: google does not know what you just said Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: You have now said 'something'. Congratulations! You are our 100th something!
 MSmits: we do have quite a few somethings
 Astrobytes: Spelling varies but that was "Where did you pull that one from"
 MSmits: ahhh ok
 Astrobytes: fi/fae
 MSmits: just googled typical scottish expressions
 MSmits: I am watching the social dilemma
 MSmits: Arjen Lubach (our John Oliver) did a good segment on the same issue
 Astrobytes: It's very regional, I use a lot of Glaswegian stuff as it's familial but I use East coast stuff because I live there
 MSmits: it's really scary
 Astrobytes: I haven't watched it yet
 MSmits: i meant the Dutch programma 
 MSmits: programme
 MSmits: it showed people demonstrating at our political centres
 MSmits: claiming our leaders are pedophile blood drinkers
 Astrobytes: No I mean I didn't watch the Social Dilemma yet
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: but that was what was really scary
 MSmits: you dont imagine so many people in your country are on this path
 MSmits: it's like 10-15%
 Astrobytes: Oh soooo many yes
 Astrobytes: "claiming our leaders are pedophile blood drinkers" - yep
 MSmits: The Dutch are one of the least vulnerable people to this sort of thing, I think, but if we go this easily...
 Astrobytes: They latched on to some anti-establishment vibes (justified) and get sucked into this crap
 MSmits: but so fast
 wlesavo: nice westicles, some improvement?
 MSmits: Arjen Lubach made a fresh youtube accounrt
 MSmits: he needed 3 clicks to get into conspiracyland
 MSmits: it's crazy
 Westicles: wlesavo, yes #26 popped up
 Astrobytes: Yep. That sounds about right
 Astrobytes: And, not sure about others experiences, but it's a lot of so-called 'free thinkers' I see getting sucked into this crap
 MSmits: free in this context meaning an unstructured, vulnerable mind
 Astrobytes: It's essentially cult style indoctrination
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: we have a political party catering to this now
 Astrobytes: Put 2 + 2 + 2 together, all good so far, add another 2 + 2 + 2 get 956, too late by then
 Astrobytes: They take common issues and problems and provide an *explanation*, which is why people gravitate towards these things I think
 MSmits: I have been judging the US for those trumpian idiots with their crazy signs and stuff for like 6 years
 MSmits: but we apparently have those too , just in lesser numbers
 Astrobytes: I think, personally, the reality is much worse and people can't handle the fact that there's a lot of stuff without tangible blame or reasoning
 MSmits: yeah that is it exactly
 Astrobytes: Same everywhere MSmits
 Westicles: Yeah, half the people are idiots&#160;:)
 Westicles: And not my half
 MSmits: i dunno, I always thought my country was well educated, sober etc. But that's probably just a bias from the people I associate wit
 Astrobytes: Bluntly put, yes Westicles
 Astrobytes: Yes, there's a lot of bias now, bubble effects etc. Nothing that hasn't been going on as a society previously but magnified in different ways I guess
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: Anyway, very deep for a Monday eh
 MSmits: it's very  paradoxical that it's easier to find out what other people think, but we are less likely to do it
 Astrobytes: Yes, you have to actually actively pursue it
 MSmits: yea
 HelloWorld183L: how will the second cognitive revolution with AI affect politics?
 MSmits: lol Astrobytes was already letting on that it was getting to deep and now you come with that HelloWorld183L
 Astrobytes: Indeed!!!
 HelloWorld183L: i threw that one in for some giggles hehe
 MSmits: lol
 HelloWorld183L: i've been reading Superintelligence so that came up on my mind
 HelloWorld183L: anybody else read it?
 MSmits: nah, not working on my autobiography yet
 Astrobytes: I know the book but I haven't read it no
 HelloWorld183L: interesting read, especially if you're interested in AI
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 MSmits: will remember HelloWorld183L
 MSmits: sounds good
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm always up for philosophical and ethical issues
 Astrobytes: well, the two are intertwined
 Astrobytes: Anyway
 Westicles: Bostrom?  Yeah, good book
 Astrobytes: I am going offline now
 DomiKo: buy Astro
 Astrobytes: Amazing to see chat so active today
 DomiKo: bye Astro*
 HelloWorld183L: it can provide insight into how philosophy can intertwine with AI 
 HelloWorld183L: goodbye astro
 MSmits: gn!
 MadKnight: is there a thing in c# to check for condition and throw exception if false&#160;?
 HelloWorld183L: yes an if statement
 MadKnight: too boring
 MadKnight: i need something like Assert()
 HelloWorld183L: perhaps i haven't been in cool kid language territory yet then
 DomiKo: Debug.assert I guess
 MadKnight: no that one doesn't throw exception
 MadKnight: it just stops the process
 HelloWorld183L: i don't know much about assertions but what if you just threw an exception before asserting
 MadKnight: i don't have an id
 MadKnight: if
 MadKnight: i do Assert(x&gt;3, "x must be greater than 3!")
 iKirbs: you can throw your own exceptions
 iKirbs: and catch them
 MadKnight: yea but is there an assert-like function for that&#160;?
 iKirbs: not sure bout that
 MadKnight: what's the best way to ask user to input some value and check if it's correct format and in some range()&#160;?
 MadKnight: and then ask him to input again if it's not
 MadKnight: what's the nicest way to do that&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: property change event handler, don't think cg supports it
 MadKnight: why not&#160;?
 MadKnight: cg supports events
 MadKnight: custom
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dunno, i was told event handlers beyond try and on_error didn't trigger...maybe I'm wrong
 MadKnight: what event handlers?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but set on a variable and write a trigger function
 MadKnight: how did they try it&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try is part of event handlers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try ... maybe error event handler
 MadKnight: but let's say we're not on CG, so how would it look like? i mean your solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37924612/detect-variable-change-c-sharp">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37924612/detect-variable-change-c-sharp</a>
 MadKnight: nonono i know that
 MadKnight: but i mean
 MadKnight: how would the rest look like&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dunno.  while (!int.valid());
 MadKnight: 1 - that doesn't output message saying what is wrong 2 - that doesn't look like a nice way
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I do it JS with a popup warning box
 MadKnight: so how would it look in js&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16463599/popup-window-in-winform-c-sharp">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16463599/popup-window-in-winform-c-sharp</a>
 MadKnight: noooo that's not even a part of the question
 MadKnight: i know how to popup
 MadKnight: and i know how to do properties
 PatrickMcGinnisII: JS can call a validator function on form submit
 MadKnight: yea but that's a different case
 MadKnight: i'm talking about console app
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can show hidden error messages and highlight fields, etc.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh
 colinemonds: @MadKnight doing it in a loop is kind of the classic way to do it in most imperative languages
 colinemonds: wrap it in a method (that you pass a Predicate into for validation) if you don't want it to clutter up your code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, just while(1) and break out when they input something valid
 MadKnight: hmm but what about non-imperative langs, colinemonds&#160;?
 MadKnight: or imperative but a lot of language features
 colinemonds: actually, same story, just with recursion instead of a loop...
 MadKnight: no, recursion is a workaround
 MadKnight: and is bad
 MadKnight: and dirty
 colinemonds: well, functional languages don't usually offer loops (as a language feature)
 MadKnight: yea
 colinemonds: recursion is fine as long as tail-calls are eliminated
 colinemonds: (which they aren't in C#, obviously)
 MadKnight: tail-calls&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: .TryParse(Console.ReadLine(),
 MadKnight: recursion in this case is a dirty workaround
 colinemonds: tail-call elimination means that if the recursive call is the last thing that happens in the function body, the compiler will convert the function into basically a loop (ie the "tail"-call will not allocate a stack frame)
 MadKnight: oh
 colinemonds: most FP have this
 MadKnight: oh right i know about that
 MadKnight: i just didn't know the name
 MadKnight: but anyway
 MadKnight: how to avoid this dirty workaround and make it better?
 colinemonds: I don't really understand why you think everything is dirty here
 colinemonds: loops are dirty
 colinemonds: recursion is dirty
 MadKnight: loops are just imperative
 MadKnight: but using recursion as while(!good) is bad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not as bad as hooking a variable with .onchange
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darn thing will always be listening
 PatrickMcGinnisII: of course, turning the listener an and off makes it better
 MadKnight: it's clearly a workaround, colinemonds
 MadKnight: it's not supposed to be like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is vodka cheap in russia?
 MadKnight: u wanna visit russia to buy a ton of vodka&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just googled it, 5 x cheaper than here
 MadKnight: do u not agree that recursion instead of while() does seem kinda like a workaround&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: JS is full of workarounds that include recursion, its a mess
 colinemonds: MadKnight: it's not a workaround per say, different languages just have different philosophies
 MadKnight: oh with this guy we were talking about FP, PatrickMcGinnisII
 colinemonds: if you use recursion instead of while() in C#, you're doing it wrong
 MadKnight: but what about FP&#160;?
 colinemonds: if you're doing it in Haskell, it's absolutely fine
 MadKnight: but it doesn't seem to make any sense
 MadKnight: it's just super weird
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's a bunch of functions that work great recursively that are faster and don't bloat the kernel
 colinemonds: programming languages like that have special syntax that supports this use
 MadKnight: yea i know it does
 colinemonds: in conjunction with tail call elimination, there is also no runtime impact
 MadKnight: do u know what's MCTS&#160;?
 colinemonds: no, what's that?
 MadKnight: let's go to DM colinemonds&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I am curious about infinite series use in FP lang
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i digress
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, yall have fun, took me 4 hours to get one puzzle done, fml
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 ZarthaxX: nice PatrickMcGinnisII sounds frustrating asf
 MeyerIvan: Hi, how do you use a sqrt() funtion without including math.h library?
 MadKnight: std::sqrt
 MadKnight: include cmath
 MadKnight: double sqrt(double);
 MeyerIvan: it doesn't let me include it
 MeyerIvan: I'm allowed to write only in the green area, inside the while loop
 MadKnight: why doesn't&#160;?
 MadKnight: u are doing something wrong 100%
 MadKnight: MeyerIvan
 MeyerIvan: It's solved. I needed to use less IA, only force the result without calculations. Thanks
 joshnho: any1 still here&#160;?
 Skeenie: sup
 joshnho: oh i wanted to see from the game clash i just did
 joshnho: wanted sum1 to look at my code and tell me why the hell it didnt pass only the last test lol
 joshnho: but nvm i guess
 joshnho: unless u can help
 theredbobct: Yea! What language did you use?
 theredbobct: I have no clue how to write C++ but I can do C and Java
 MadKnight: yea i get it
 MadKnight: oh
 MadKnight: theredbobct joshnho Skeenie hey
 MadKnight: u guys solved the problems&#160;?
 theredbobcat: Heya! Which ones?
 theredbobcat: Sorry I've been doing these all night XD
 FuriousT: If you are "replaying same conditions" it works fine until you attempt a run where you have a code error (syntatx etc).  Then once you've corrected the error the replay no longer plays the GFX and the page has to be reloaded (whereupon you lose your replay conditions).
 MiguelFeliciano: How am I missing this last test case??? Temperatures - No Temperature... I'm checking for NaN using Javascript and returning zero.  What the hell is it looking for when it's expecting: Nothing?
 ZarthaxX: you print nothing
 MadKnight: hey ZarthaxX
 Coder613: hey all I'm a beginner here. how do you get thor to get the angle in power of thor episode 1?
 ZarthaxX: you print the direction you wish him to move Coder613
 Coder613: right that worked for the straight lines but not for the angle. he always strays off course when it comes to the angles.
 ZarthaxX: what do you mean by angles
 Coder613: when he moves sw to get to the light he always foes too much south
 ZarthaxX: you are giving the wrong directions then
 ZarthaxX: you can choose to just move N, S,W or E
 ZarthaxX: you dont have to always move in both directions
 Coder613: Is there any way to increment the degree of direction? Like say divide it by half?
 ZarthaxX: no
 ZarthaxX: show a replay of your problem
 ZarthaxX: you can share the video of thor dying

 Coder613: sorry I dont know if that was it. can you see it?
 ZarthaxX: nop lol
 ZarthaxX: you gotta see in the same bar where you press play in the replay
 ZarthaxX: an icon that is to share the video
 Coder613: right then i found your profile but i cant figure out past that

 Coder613: I think I figured it out. Thanks so much ZarthaxX you were very helpful.
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: nice :P
 ZarthaxX: have fun!
 Coder613: thanks you too!

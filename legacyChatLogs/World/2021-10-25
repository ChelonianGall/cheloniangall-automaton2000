 TimothyAlexisVass: Is it possible to write monospaced text in the Statement of a contribution?
 VizGhar: sounds like some kind of inverse ACO&#160;:)
 VizGhar: TimothyAlexisVass `monospace` isn't what you need?
 TimothyAlexisVass: It says `Monospace` renders as: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8a964b9-fab2-4fc7-92bc-b3901e28d56d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8a964b9-fab2-4fc7-92bc-b3901e28d56d</a>
 VizGhar: it will print monospace but on next line
 VizGhar: Shows like that for some reason? i dont understand
 Westicles: TimothyAlexisVass, when you have too many contribs people tend to downvote them all
 TimothyAlexisVass: Instead of showing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 with a monospace font, it shows like this:`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0`...
 brianS: hi
 Westicles: I have too many myself right now as well
 TimothyAlexisVass: OK, it shows correctly in the IDE.
 TimothyAlexisVass: Westicles, Thanks, I've made some private.
 derjack: puzzle of the week contains "Settlers of Catan". where is the copyright police!?
 PlzDrWill: Lets say F=WXYZ, L=5, j= 0 and i = 1. What does this in Python? (F  .index(p [j])-F  .index(p [i]))&#160;% L
 Flowersquare: F.index(a) means " find the index of a in the 'F' string", it returns a number
 Flowersquare: it seems to calculate the difference of two characters in "WXYZ"
 Wontonimo: make each pellet emit a smell to the nearby connecting cells.  iterate 30 times or so, such that the smell will go mostly across the board.  Then just pick the direction that has the greatest smell.
 PlzDrWill: thak you mate!

 eulerscheZahl: but how shall I earn money now, derjack?
 struct: derjack did you see what happened to CTTT?
 eulerscheZahl: :mirror:
 eulerscheZahl: no mirror?&#160;:(
 struct: yes euler mirror
 eulerscheZahl: but should be possible with 9x9 too, right?
 eulerscheZahl: just mirror around the center cell
 eulerscheZahl: and start with the center if you have the first move
 struct: yeah
 Staxx: banan:rage:
 eulerscheZahl: there was this game with a similar problem of p2 mirroring p1. that 3D game where you build towers
 eulerscheZahl: "focus"?
 eulerscheZahl: they solved it my doing a slightly randomized, asymmetric setup
 eulerscheZahl: maybe that's how to solve counting TTT: start the game in turn 3 or 4
 struct: yeah that should work
 struct: I guess the author has some work to do
 eulerscheZahl: who approved that mess? :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh, no jacek in the list. nvm
 struct: im surprised no one noticed before
 AntiSquid: ya nevermind uniqueness 
 eulerscheZahl: same
 darkhorse64: because people tried to win the game, not to draw it
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 derjack: whats the problem
 eulerscheZahl: fun thing: even the initial proposal (9x9 without 2nd match) would have worked better
 struct: cttt is solved as a draw for either player derjack
 AntiSquid: so then question is how many tic tac toe games until there's too many? although you could consider tulips and daisies one of them :joy:
 derjack: how it was solved
 eulerscheZahl: it's still broken
 struct: by Waffle3z
 struct: you only have to mirror opponent move to force a draw
 AntiSquid: perfect excuse to instantly and urgently remove it then
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/587684492">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/587684492</a>
 AntiSquid: it looks like low effort
 derjack: w00t
 struct: he submited a 100% draw bot before
 derjack: i know! lets make steal rule!
 struct: has p1 you play a random move then you just copy opponent move  if its possible
 struct: if its not you play a random one
 struct: opponent will have to end up playing one of your mirrored cells
 AntiSquid: add a bomb rule, you get 1 bomb per game that will remove anything in a 3x3 area&#160;!!
 struct: fog
 AntiSquid: velocity, you have a certain amount of fuel you can use to place your symbol down slightly faster, you get +1 fuel per turn, strategising is key

 eulerscheZahl: let's give the author the possibility to change something
 eulerscheZahl: author is aware of the issue
 AntiSquid: w/e king domino has 2 versions approved ...
 AntiSquid: oh so he's going to change something, that's good
 AntiSquid: rezasi use different art style please 
 derjack: why?
 derjack: UTTT pstd?
 derjack: ptsd ~
 AntiSquid: nah i won't use that term so lightly, it's not even discontent with UTTT, but definitely would be great to have games more distinguishable
 eulerscheZahl: *struct taking notes*
 AntiSquid: &gt; hex tic tac toe&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: let's do counting hex tic tac toe.you have 2 possbile actions: claim a cell and rotate the 6 cells around a center cell
 eulerscheZahl: each pair of (cell, mirror cell) can only be rotated once
 Scarfield: is it really a problem that you can force a draw, you will have to win games to get up the leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: the draw bot can equalize everyone by repeatedly submitting it
 Scarfield: makes sense, sad times
 eulerscheZahl: you could also minimax the last few turns to beat the bad bots at least
 PrincessTrunks: Oh PRINCESS TRUNKS
 eulerscheZahl: *those which don't also mirror

 Astrobytes: was just waiting for it
 Scarfield: chat has been "interesting" lately
 eulerscheZahl: so, 3 days left for the rubik cube
 Scarfield: Astroibytes
 Astrobytes: ScarboroughFairfield
 eulerscheZahl: i still wonder how to play this properly. my current solution just tries random sequences and compares scores
 Scarfield: haha thats the first fingerpicking song i learned xD
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm completely lost
 Astrobytes: Scarborough Fair, it's an old piece of music
 Astrobytes: Scarfield -&gt; ScarboroughFairfield
 eulerscheZahl: that explains why I didn't get it
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed.
 Scarfield: oh thats right, you dont listen to music do you?
 Astrobytes: SA for the rubiks?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think SA will work well
 eulerscheZahl: 1 changed twist in the middle of the sequence, completely different outcome
 eulerscheZahl: i listen to silence
 Astrobytes: I see. Hmm.
 eulerscheZahl: as the game is right now: find some sequences that swap a few tiles without ruining the rest
 eulerscheZahl: then apply those for some careful improvements
 Scarfield: can you solve a rubiks cube by hand? could implement those algos, but sounds boring though
 eulerscheZahl: the optim is designed in a way that it's not solvable
 LigmaCheese: ok
 eulerscheZahl: intentionally bad inputs
 LigmaCheese: Is coding AI hard?
 eulerscheZahl: depends how deep you want to get into it
 eulerscheZahl: if you consider reaching bronze or silver league as your goal, then it's not that hard
 LigmaCheese: Oh okay.
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to go for the very top, it's extremely hard
 LigmaCheese: I probably won't get that far so ill just be in the easy side.
 Astrobytes: Aim high, you learn more
 Scarfield: didnt check out the cube contrib before, damn its cool, but the colors are weird, yellow and white are usually opposite
 eulerscheZahl: i even suggested having testcases with 5 or 7 different colors
 eulerscheZahl: but jrke didn't get that far which is fine too
 LigmaCheese: How do I add the thrust to the pod thing.
 Scarfield: output a string "x y thrust"
 Scarfield: 1200 550 200 
 eulerscheZahl: no 200 in lower leagues
 Scarfield: true, but you get the idea i suppose LigmaCheese?&#160;:)
 LigmaCheese: Yes

 Waffle3z: how do you try to exploit weaker opponents in a game that's drawn? how can you evaluate any one move to be better than a move that leads to a draw? the one that gives your opponent the most chances to make a mistake?
 69razer69: are u playing breakthrough
 jacek: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: minimax the endgame
 jacek: no draws in breakthrough
 Waffle3z: if you minimax the start position it's a draw, so wouldn't minimax not care what move you make
 Waffle3z: so long as it doesn't lose, they're all equal
 Waffle3z: the only way one non-losing move is better than another is if you assume some level of incompetence from your opponent
 jacek: makes moves that maximize the amount of mistake an opponent can make
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested to minimax the last few turns when you can simulate until the end of the game
 Waffle3z: yeah that was something I was thinking of, play draw strat until the game is small enough that it can be solved, but even then, how do you prioritize "better" moves over the ones that draw, since the opponent can always draw
 69razer69: am lost there is a lot of sample projects and everything is diffrent

 Queuebee: does that make sense&#160;:$
 69razer69: points have cords 
 69razer69:&#160;?
 Queuebee: yes
 69razer69: combinations of length 2
 69razer69: or can be more

 Astrobytes: yeah something like that
 eulerscheZahl: if copyright holders find out and dislike it, it's at least a removal from the platform
 eulerscheZahl: but as long as CG doesn't proactively remove it, i think it's safe
 struct: ofc
 struct: if the author of yavalath was against it i would remove it
 struct: maybe MSmits bought the game due to cg
 eulerscheZahl: i even got someone into buying the Onitama board game because of the multiplayer game here
 Scarfield: you should sue them for advertisement payment

 eulerscheZahl: that's a valid complain
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: Absolutely
 struct: They probably jsut forgot

 Astrobytes: yeah that's what I thought struct

 MrGrease: i liked c# idk about c++
 Ouranos666: very possible, it's kinda pain in the a** but when u master it, you can do everything 
 Ouranos666: that's what i'm trying to do
 Ouranos666: what about you guys?
 MrGrease: good luck
 Ouranos666: thanks 
 MrGrease: i'm on python
 Ouranos666: great 
 MrGrease: it's kinda challenging but i'm liking it
 Ouranos666: yeah python is pretty awesome, good luck with that 
 MrGrease: thanks you too!
 Ouranos666: no problem
 jacek: i only use python for prototyping
 Ouranos666: same
 jacek: :scream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI3FRsSAa_U&amp;t=379s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI3FRsSAa_U&amp;t=379s</a>
 Hagan: deez
 Ouranos666: nuts
 Astrobytes: Stop it please.
 Hagan: no
 Kena_C: Hey does anyone have any tips for this? Im kind of going in blind and could use some help ^^
 TheBlueBias: 'this'? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: this-&gt;thing
 TheBlueBias: Oh! :o
 Kena_C: Just the formatting of the code and such, I've really only used CSS &amp; HTML (Teacher told us to use javascript for this)
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/KY-ru62rBC4?t=6">https://youtu.be/KY-ru62rBC4?t=6</a>
 struct: Kena_C the teacher told you to come here to learn js?
 Kena_C: To practice with different codes yeah, just as a small sidebar assignment from our main ones 
 struct: I think this site is a bit too hard for people that dont know any programming language
 Kena_C: I see I see
 struct: What is the assignment?
 Astrobytes: If you choose to learn javascript (or whatever) alongside this, it's possible. But you need a solid foundation.
 Kena_C: We were told to start on the Chuck Norris puzzle and had to pick Javascript since HTML wasn't on there
 ipsissimus: chuck norris was hard af for me
 jacek: the descent or temperatures should be easier eh
 ipsissimus: struct had to hit me with sage wisdom
 Astrobytes: HTML to solve a puzzle . . .
 jacek: "HTML is a programming language!"
 eulerscheZahl: this already shows the lack of background knowledge&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Quite.
 TheBlueBias: CSS is Turring complete!
 struct: I dont think many people will be able to complete this assignment 
 eulerscheZahl: Turring?
 TheBlueBias: Yup. Roll the rrrrrrr
 Astrobytes: Nice try
 TheBlueBias: trry
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 ipsissimus: i watched a youtube vid where the guy made animations using only CSS
 ipsissimus: said if you make it more than 4MB
 ipsissimus: it will crash browser
 ipsissimus: because thats all they usually allocate for it
 TheBlueBias: 4MB? What kind of CSS file is that? Oo
 jacek: dice duel assets
 ipsissimus: python shortening question
 ipsissimus: input()for i in input().split():
 ipsissimus: can this be written more concisely?
 TheBlueBias: Yes
 jacek: i.e. reverse if, n%2 instead of n%2==0
 ipsissimus: ah right, because 0 is false
 ipsissimus: good eye
 jacek: but i think map etc would be more useful here
 ipsissimus: what about the n = int(i)
 ipsissimus: is that superfluous
 ipsissimus: please elaborate on the map()
 ipsissimus: i really need to get it under my belt
 jacek: or lambda
 jacek: im writing random smart words, i dont know them
 ipsissimus: nah cmon now, I've seen a ton of map() usage to shorten code, but implementation is still a problem for me
 ipsissimus: im sure it will be a huge boost to my capability if I can learn to use it correctly
 ipsissimus: all i can see is map for the int() cast
 ipsissimus: but im not sure the syntax for it
 RoboStac: input()for i in input().split():print(f"[{' x'[int(i)%2]}]",i)
 jacek: oO
 ipsissimus: im trying to understand your usage of the {} here
 ipsissimus: they seem out of place to my eyes,
 ipsissimus: :thinking:
 RoboStac: they're just to get the variable into  the f string
 RoboStac: ' x'[ int(i)&#160;% 2 ]
 RoboStac: gives ' ' if i is odd, 'x' if i is event
 ipsissimus: and if it has to be ' ' instead of <i></i>
 ipsissimus:&#160;?
 ipsissimus: oh nvm
 ipsissimus: you wrote that
 RoboStac: ah yeah, didn't spot the original didn't have a space in there
 RoboStac: hmm
 RoboStac: that makes it more awkward
 ipsissimus: yeah its usually just one operation that makes me not know a better way to implement
 ipsissimus: if it werent there, then i could stack it better
 ipsissimus: but its not usually so easy
 RoboStac: input()for i in input().split():print(["[]","[x]"][int(i)%2],i)
 RoboStac: isn't too much worse
 ipsissimus: and without format?
 ipsissimus: i need to plug it in to an ide and see for myself
 ipsissimus: thanks for the suggestions
 ipsissimus: i hate that my intuitions that it can be easily one lined are always right, even if i cant figure out how to do it in the time alloted
 RoboStac: ah, actually can do the same size as my first attempt
 RoboStac: input()for i in input().split():print(f"[{'x'[:int(i)%2]}]",i)
 RoboStac: (drop's the space but adds a&#160;:)
 ipsissimus: job interview in 5 mins, wish me luck
 ipsissimus: ill be back
 struct: gl
 TheBlueBias: a=inputa()for i in a().split():a(f"[{'x'[:int(i)%2]}]",i)
 jacek: if there are only 2 input there is not saving
 RoboStac: he's trying to use input() to print as well, but I think that'd fail with more than 1 number?
 TheBlueBias: Oh? Didn't try
 hamzapro: hi
 hamzapro: I am new
 jacek: hello new
 hamzapro: hi
 hamzapro: how are you
 jacek: im fine
 hamzapro: cool&#160;:)
 Uljahn: hi fine, im cat
 hamzapro: sup cat
 hamzapro: cat
 hamzapro: meow
 Astrobytes: Hi cat, I'm cat2
 hamzapro: hi
 hamzapro: cat2]
 hamzapro:  I am new
 Astrobytes: Hi new
 hamzapro: samee
 hamzapro: I suck a codeing
 hamzapro: I mean at
 hamzapro: I got to go
 hamzapro: bye
 Westicles: ah, a new puzzle.  time to pop over to #fr and see if they hate it
 TheBlueBias: Of course they do
 Westicles: heh heh... "throw the puzzle in the trash"
 ipsissimus: im back
 ipsissimus: company that prints "currency stock paper" looking for vision engineer
 ipsissimus: :O
 FBF_Luis: guys, if my contribution has 2 approvals and I change it, will it lose the approvals?
 TheBlueBias: No. You can even change it completely after validation...
 FBF_Luis: doesn't make much sense that I can change it, but thanks&#160;:)
 Westicles: If it expires you lose the two approvals.  So if it gets close change it to WIP and back
 FBF_Luis: it is dangerously close (20 hours lol) but I think I can get it approved
 struct: you can always resubmit it
 struct: it will never be truly gone
 Westicles: yeah, but if you go WIP before it expires it goes to 30 days with the 2 approvals intact
 Waffle3z: do changes to multis have to come from the creator? I don't think RezaSi has been on lately to notice the game was solved
 struct: I think anyone can tbh
 struct: But I would wait a few days
 FBF_Luis: anyways, if by tomorrow morning is not approved I will change it to wip and back
 FBF_Luis: nvm, I will do that now because tomorrow I have no time
 Waffle3z: doesn't look like anyone can modify multis, not like clash of code contributions
 struct: hmm
 struct: maybe you need level 30
 Westicles: 29, yeah
 Waffle3z: I'm level 27, gotta grind some something I guess
 Westicles: It isn't set to allow people to download source code, so you have to know the trick
 struct: no trick can help for that Westicles
 struct: at least that im aware
 struct: For the source code I mean
 Westicles: Oh, I thought the download boss option gave you the whole code...
 struct: nope
 darkhorse64: The source code is available on Github. You can pull a request if you wish
 Westicles: Well, that explains why people were getting cranky when I asked about it.  I could care less about bosses
 Westicles: *couldn't
 struct: wdym Westicles
 Westicles: I wanted to get at source to figure out the SDK, but it probably looked like I was after bosses
 struct: ah I see
 struct: you dont even have multiplayer bots I dont think why people would think you want the boss codes lol
 darkhorse64: Is there really a way to save the multi&#160;? I understand that 9x9 is also a forced draw at least from p1
 Westicles: I'm a shady character :P
 Waffle3z: how is 9x9 a forced draw?
 Waffle3z: I mean it probably is but not solved is it?
 struct: darkhorse64 its forced win but you will still have to get the most lines possible
 darkhorse64: play center and then mirror p2 moves
 struct: wait is it forced draw?
 struct: But p1 has 1 extra move
 darkhorse64: I read that on the chat this afernoon
 darkhorse64: afternoon
 struct: I think that is only for even sized boards
 darkhorse64: does not "play center and mirror p2 moves" end the same&#160;? p1 may even win
 darkhorse64: for add sized boards
 darkhorse64: odd
 struct: Oh it will end up as a draw because that strategy will possibly minimize the points p1 can get
 struct: I see
 Waffle3z: if p1 plays in the middle and then mirrors p2, they end up with the exact same set of 3 in a rows as p2, plus some extra ones that might include the middle. how many extra ones is important, because if p2 gets more extra ones in the second round, they win
 Waffle3z: maybe it's easy to control that though and the game is just solved for any size
 Waffle3z: if it's not then that's the game
 jacek: welp, now you tell us
 Waffle3z: or maybe turn 1 steal fixes it
 Waffle3z: ig you just go in the middle after turn 1 though
 LelouchVC2: the answer is flex tape
 Queuebee: I build my code out of flex tape
 Wontonimo: or on each turn you specify your placement and a shift applied to the previous move of North, South, East, West, Stay which cannot move into other occupied squares
 struct: He can always make it 3d
 struct: like 3d ttt
 struct: maybe you can also play same move as opponent though
 Astrobytes: steal move was suggested to the author, did he not try it? I guess he just switched board size from the previous WIP discussion
 struct: I guess it needs some testing
 struct: I never had to test any of the games, because they already existed :p
 Astrobytes: That was said previously.... in WIP...
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: anyway, I'm outta here, gn
 LelouchVC2: good mornin
 EimantasJ: Hello
 mathod31: I have a question, I'm a beginner, sometimes I do clashes where I have to finish the fastest, I finish first, but in the end I end up 2nd or 3rd, is that normal?
 mathod31: the number of characters is important? However they say that we have to finish as soon as possible
 Waffle3z: in shortest mode the shortest solution wins
 Wontonimo: hello everyone, new and old
 Queuebee: hi
 Wontonimo: hey Queuebee, are you working on multis?  Like this CTTT everyone is chatting about?
 Deiwyy: Hows life everyone?
 Wontonimo: good.  like actually pretty stellar.  How about you?
 Wontonimo: looks like you just joined Deiwyy and are also from Netherlands like Queuebee.  
 Wontonimo: There is more on this platform than clash of code, like puzzles and multiplayer bot battles
 Queuebee: the CTTT what now
 Queuebee: I have NO clue
 Queuebee: I'm just trying to get a RANDOM NUMBER in rust
 Wontonimo: CTTT = Counting TicTacToe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe</a>
 Wontonimo: that's a multi bot battle.
 Wontonimo: there are puzzles that are solo.  This is actually one of my fav series called mars lander <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 Wontonimo: (turn off your volume if you play mars lander.  you have been warned)
 Queuebee: I.. this.
 Queuebee: this is too complex
 Wontonimo: tell me more about what you know and I may be able to find a puzzle that is a better match
 Wontonimo: looks like you've got python and c++ skills
 Wontonimo: do you know about loops, arrays, and functions?
 Queuebee: yes I just don't understand anything more theoretical than elementary maths
 Wontonimo: okay, cool.  I'll keep that in mind.
 Wontonimo: let's start with the beginning, here is "The Descent" <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 Queuebee: I did that one ;o
 Wontonimo: give it a try and tell me how easy/hard it was 
 Wontonimo: oh,
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: okay, try my puzzle "Fax Machine"
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine</a>
 Queuebee: oo interesting
 Wontonimo: it is similar to the encoding used in a much harder puzzle called "music scores"
 Queuebee: okay well
 Queuebee: it's veryt interesting but my brain can't handle 
 Wontonimo: what part&#160;?
 Queuebee: actually maybe it can wait
 Queuebee: it can, wait*
 Waffle3z: thinking about odd board sizes in cttt. If p1 plays in the center and then mirrors all of p2's moves, I've found that p2 can guarantee that the center adds no points, so this strategy leads to a draw. If p1 wants to win then they have to do something else.
 Wontonimo: very interesting
 Waffle3z: considering what happens if p1 goes in the center, then p2 moves, then p1 doesn't mirror it, and p2 mirrors all of p1's future moves. since p1 is doing the leading, they can make the center worth points, so the mirroring strategy is losing for p2
 Waffle3z: so if p1 uses the mirroring strat, the best they can hope for is a draw, and if p2 does it, they lose. If p1 forces a draw in round 1, the opponent can try to win in round 2 when they become p1
 struct: yeah is at least a proven loss for p22
 struct: p2*
 struct: since p1 can just mirror p2 moves
 Waffle3z: not a loss, p2 can force a draw if p1 mirrors
 struct: sure but is at least a draw
 Waffle3z: only if p1 mirrors
 struct: yeah
 Waffle3z: p1 just shouldn't do that
 Waffle3z: and if they don't and p2 does, p2 loses, so they shouldn't do it either
 Waffle3z: so mirroring doesn't work on odd boards
 struct: not sure if the game is salvageable
 Waffle3z: if p1 draws in round 1, the opponent can still win round 2
 Waffle3z: afaik p2 can't trivially force a draw on odd boards
 Waffle3z: if p1 wants to win, they probably have to play normally, and so does p2
 Waffle3z: p1 can force a draw and p2 can't
 Deiwyy: do yall ever just
 Deiwyy: cum in a jar
 Dren: for what purpose?
 Wontonimo: Deiwyy - keep it generally polite, on topic, related to coding, and generally PG
 Wontonimo: there are mods online and can get banned easily
 struct: yeah let that be a warning
 struct: next time will be a kick or ban
 struct: 50/50
 LittleFlea: struct ,may i show you again my answer for there is no spoon puzzle challenge like the other day.my code work .i am sure of it from the error log.but it still says i don't get all the input
 struct: sure
 LittleFlea: nevermind i achieved to find why.i have all the right node.not in the right place.which is still just an issue of finding the right order
 LittleFlea: got it at 50% 0_0 so close
 LittleFlea: i am learning so much about array manipulation tho
 LittleFlea: lol just forgot a ++ somewhere.now i got 100% thanks struct
 struct: well you did the puzzle solo
 struct: dont need to thanks lol
 LittleFlea: and the code is so much better looking than when i showed it to you the other day.created a class to hold each node and output all of the registered node at once.and the default value if not change is set to "-1 -1".
 LittleFlea: sorry i am just genuinely happy with the code and the achieved puzzle.been on my mind for 2 weeks.
 struct: gj on the puzzle
 LittleFlea: by the way.do you know a decent tutorial for MCDS . all i find are explanation on what it is and not the implementation.
 struct: whats mcds?
 LittleFlea: monte carlos tree diagram or something like that
 struct: mcts?
 struct: monte carlo tree search
 struct: or is that not it?
 LittleFlea: yup exactly.
 struct: maybe
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/">https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/</a>
 struct: I never read any tutorial on it so dont have any reference 
 LittleFlea: i do not know where to learn it otherwise.
 struct: check that tutorial 
 LittleFlea: i will.thanks for your time.by the way what is the icon next to your name?
 struct: just random lines
 LittleFlea: nvm i just hovered on the said icon and saw you are a moderator.
 struct: ah that icon
 struct: i thought it was my profile pic sorry
 skotz: anyone know the reasoning behind league promotions taking hours to go through?
 Thorcode: skotz, it needs time to do all of the battles and calculate your point.
 Thorcode: I only know that
 skotz: yeah, i'm talking about after the battles and ranking stabilization complete and it says "you'll be promoted to [league++] in 2h 30m"
 Thorcode: It need to check that if in that hour the bot beats you.....
 Thorcode: or another player beat you
 skotz: it would make sense for it to wait a little while, but 2+ hours is crazy... guess it's proportional to the number of people in the league? i'll be out of the zone by then&#160;:)
 struct: it only happens on older multis
 skotz: to protect higher leagues from getting bloated?
 Wontonimo: to make something for people to talk about on world chat
 skotz: success
 _Royale: skotz: if you are playing CSB (Mad Pod Racing) I suppose this is to avoid simultaneous resubmits when someones beats the boss and promotes many other players with him.
 _Royale: there are so many players on this game that it used to slow down the whole platform when someone beats the boss&#160;:-)
 skotz: ah, interesting
 Wontonimo: that sir is a much better answer
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode and LittleFlea
 Thorcode: Hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: have you done any puzzles lately Thorcode?
 Thorcode: I almost done mars lander
 Thorcode: and I realize that my code need to fix alot
 struct: episode 2?
 Thorcode: yep
 LonelyRubberDuckFromHell_9696: XD
 Thorcode: I ran out off power
 Thorcode: and I can use this code
 Thorcode: b = [c for c in ly if ly[c]&gt;1]
 Thorcode: ly = list
 Thorcode: oh my ly is not list
 Thorcode: I'm stupid
 ankan2526: Valar Morghulis
 adamgosnell: how do I round to, say, the 2nd decimal place in Javascript? Math.round only goes to the whole number. 
 Thorcode: use round(a,)2
 Thorcode: round(a,2)
 struct: toFixed(2)
 struct: n.toFixed(2)
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: it is not python
 Thorcode: b = [c for c in ly if ly[c]&gt;1] how to fix this code not error
 Thorcode: it got list index out of range
 M1nerman: c in ly gives each object of your list ly, not the index
 Thorcode: thanks 
 M1nerman: so if you're checking if each element is greater than 1 then just use [c for c in ly if c&gt;1]
 Thorcode: I'm trying to check if the element is dupilcate
 M1nerman: oh, then you can use ly.count(c) 
 Dren: yeah if you want to just create a list with duplicates
 Dren: filter(lambda x: ly.count(x)&gt;1, ly)
 Thorcode: i got it
 Thorcode: import collectionsb = [item for item, count in collections.Counter(y).items() if count &gt; 1]
 Thorcode: I got a list x = [1,2,3,4,5] and b =[2]  how to know x[?]=b
 Thorcode: I was trying to find this on internet for a few days
 Dren: x.index(item)
 Dren: or x.find()
 Thorcode: x.find(b)?
 Thorcode: thanks
 Dren: yeah though since b is a list here it might be b[0]
 yoursosussy: i dont know how to code
 yoursosussy: im so sussy
 yoursosussy: :flushed::flushed::flushed::flushed::flushed::flushed::flushed::flushed::flushed::flushed:
 Thorcode: try to learn in an another site like w3school and etc

 Coderboi270: hello
 DialFrost: anyone willing to help me in puzzles?&#160;:)
 Andriamanitra: go ahead and ask if you have some questions, we can't know if we can help if we don't know what the problem is
 DialFrost: well im stuck with the easiest puzzle temperature
 DialFrost:&#160;:(
 DialFrost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/af2f73ec-5bdd-4ddb-9b2a-08c7dde09aed">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/af2f73ec-5bdd-4ddb-9b2a-08c7dde09aed</a>
 DialFrost: this is what i have rn
 DialFrost: test case 04 fails
 Andriamanitra: seems like you just need to handle the case where you have the same temperature both positive and negative
 DialFrost: ye
 DialFrost: i cant figure out how
 Andriamanitra: use &lt; instead of &lt;= and have another branch deal with the == case
 Andriamanitra: is the simplest fix
 DialFrost: what do i have to put in the == branch
 DialFrost:&#160;:/
 Andriamanitra: pick the larger of the two to be a
 Andriamanitra: if i remember correctly that it always wanted the positive one
 DialFrost: its the same as this right
 DialFrost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e489a52a-5b4d-47ad-bf2b-6e6706555c4c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e489a52a-5b4d-47ad-bf2b-6e6706555c4c</a>
 Andriamanitra: no, it could also be t that is negative
 DialFrost:&#160;?
 DialFrost: my method works 100%
 DialFrost: but urs is shorter thx Andriamanitra!
 Andriamanitra: oh right, the case where t is negative doesn't matter because you only want to replace negative with positive
 Andriamanitra: "-" in str(a) is very weird way to do essentially a &lt; 0
 DialFrost: ye lol
 DialFrost: thx now my code is less than 100 bytes long!
 chenhaorantianjiayi: hello?
 DialFrost: hi
 chenhaorantianjiayi: hi
 chenhaorantianjiayi: :grinning:
 Andriamanitra: i have 73 in python and 44 in ruby
 DialFrost: er Andriamanitra a&lt;0 or t&gt;a doesnt work
 DialFrost: 73!
 DialFrost: how
 Andriamanitra: i didn't use a loop, i used the built-in functions instead
 Andriamanitra: but it gets complicated :D
 DialFrost: bruhh
 DialFrost: 44 in ruby
 DialFrost: bruh
 DialFrost: thats like top 50
 2s: Tena matotra ve ity andarna Andriamanitra ity le!!!
 2s: *anarana 
 DialFrost: andriamanitra
 DialFrost: my code doesnt work the validator caught it&#160;:|

 DialFrost: welp
 DialFrost: oh wait nvrm
 DialFrost: it works now
 DialFrost: can anyone help shorten my code? (if possible)
 DialFrost: its at 98
 DialFrost: for chuck norris how do you find how many "1" or "0" are in a row
 ZXC01: x.count(1)
 DialFrost: like in "11000110000001000" i need to somehow find a way to see that there are 2 "1" in a row
 DialFrost: nonono
 DialFrost: thats counts the entire substrting
 DialFrost: i want "in a row"
 DialFrost: consecutively
 Andriamanitra: instead of checking if abs(t) == abs(a) you could check if-t==a
 Andriamanitra: to save at least a couple characters
 Andriamanitra: for big savings you'd probably need to go for a completely different approach
 DialFrost: tru
 Andriamanitra: or actually even better is if t-a because 0 is falsey in python
 Andriamanitra: oh wait you'd need a "not" in there nvm
 Andriamanitra: in another language&#160;!(t-a) would be short but in python not so much
 DialFrost: ty
 DialFrost: now im down to 91
 bug_sniper: is it efficient to use copy.deepcopy to copy a grid (list of lists) in python?
 ZXC01: quite ok
 saberscientist: what is your measure of efficiency
 bug_sniper: I'm doing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/counting-tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/counting-tictactoe</a>
 jacek: mhm
 bug_sniper: it would be nice to know if deepcopy efficiency could be a factor in how much I can calculate
 jacek: python is quite inefficient per se ;v
 saberscientist: you need to understand when you would use deep copy
 saberscientist: shallow copy will always be faster 
 saberscientist: because it only copies references
 jacek: and deepcopy is used to copy the objects, not their references
 saberscientist: but that means that if you change the stuff using that reference that change will reflect in all "copies"
 bug_sniper: the inner function calls have to touch a copy of this data and send it to more inner function calls
 bug_sniper: so shallow copies won't work
 Uljahn: deepcopy could be very slow, i'd better switch to numpy
 bug_sniper: I was thinking I may have to do something like y=[i[:] for i in x] to copy the grid from x to y. Does that also work well?
 jacek: is i list of objects
 jacek: thats still would be refernces
 bug_sniper: I mean, if the objects are just characters and numbers then it will work
 ZXC01: can anyone help me on legends of code and magic?
 Xzoky174: hello
 ZXC01: hi

 jacek: i just now noticed why it didnt work....
 jacek: for inputs here i used something like (ball.x - car.x) / 3000, but they were are ints... changing to 3000.0 fixed it
 DomiKo: I guess something like    -Wconversion 
 DomiKo: should be your friend from now
 jacek: on CG?
 DomiKo: but you can compile code on your computer
 jacek: :O
 jacek: i use punchcards
 Sandborg: Is c++ bugged or something? Often i've getting the correct result printed out, but the system says it didn't find an answer
 Adsonmin: maybe endl is missing
 Sandborg: Hmm maybe, gonna keep that in mind when it happens again
 Sandborg: Thanks
 Adsonmin: or you wrote just one part of a solution
 Sandborg: No, all tests were correct, but that is not the problem, the problem is that it can't see my output

 surgutti: yay legend on csb
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: There's no such thing.
 surgutti: csb will always be csb
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Disney will pursue you for copyright violation! :scream:
 Westicles: oh  dear.  they don't like my drug puzzle
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Told you approvers were not real French...
 surgutti: wait what. cg changed the name cause disney took it?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Not really. They just anticipated any copytight problem they could have now they're americans...
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: *copyright
 surgutti: so now every past contest will be 'mad'?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: No. But changes are already made, take a look to the awful new names...
 surgutti: Line Racing?
 surgutti: wtf
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: They deleted visuals too.
 5DN1L: Is Mad Pod Racing named after MadKnight?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: No.
 Wizard-Dude: how do you find your position of your pod racer in the bronze league, in mad pod racer
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, can someone help me with a modularization problem. How can I put all headers in one file in C++. So I do not need to include for example string.h in all cpp files.
 BH-Empire: How do you do x, y, position in python 3??? (I'm a complete beginner)
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: You include it in the file in which you use it. I don't get your question Manchi_o6o7...
 Manchi_o6o7: If I use it in more files
 Manchi_o6o7: #include &lt;string&gt; will be used in all my cpp files
 Manchi_o6o7: can I make some header to hold all the includes
 BH-Empire: guys please how do you do mad pod racing python
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: You learn python first.
 BH-Empire: Ok...?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Manchi_o6o7 you have to include it in every files that need it. If you have multiple recuring includes you can of course put them all in a file, but you'll have to include this one everywhere.
 Manchi_o6o7: so #include "allHeader.h"
 Manchi_o6o7: in all my cpps
 Manchi_o6o7: and allHeader contains everything I need
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: You can do this. Te compiler will not include anything more than one time anyway.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: But I personally think it's clearer to explicitely list all the libs used in a specific file.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: BH-Empire; it's not to be rude. But this site is not for comple beginners. You need the basics first.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: *complete
 surgutti: #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt; will include all things that you need
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Yeah... But outside of a code golf context it's not really a good idea...
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of competitive programmers do that. and also define their macros so that they have to type less for a simple for-loop
 <b>**eulerscheZahl hates that</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: e.g. what's "vll"it's a vector&lt;long long&gt; but no one outside of the competitive community can read that
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Code golf was too precise. Let's say in non-competitive programming.
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm just not too much into those 2h contests to appreciate it
 surgutti: im something doing #define int long long
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I hate speed contest...
 Westicles: uh oh, the friends group think my drug solution is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle link i'll try it

 Wontonimo: is there an adhdttp:// also&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: timeout on test 4&#160;:(
 Westicles: well, good thing it was moved from easy to medium
 eulerscheZahl: i solved it in stupid now
 eulerscheZahl: while (sw.ElapsedMilliseconds &lt; 900) result = Math.Max(result, Solve(drugs.ToList()));
 eulerscheZahl: repeatedly trying random stuff, taking the best
 eulerscheZahl: it works by chance but doesn't give a proven best
 struct: fix it Westicles
 eulerscheZahl: i did the same on harmless rooks
 Westicles: well, my code tests them all so it should be doable
 eulerscheZahl: probably my code was just too inefficient
 eulerscheZahl: cloning lists all over the place
 Westicles: well, you did spend all of 9 minutes on it :P
 eulerscheZahl: that was the core of my failing attempt:

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/OxcuGJy">https://imgur.com/a/OxcuGJy</a>the "published" button is a lie!
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: All the site is a lie.
 eulerscheZahl: which wouldn't invalidate my statement&#160;:)
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Of course. I simply generalize.
 Westicles: blaise, tell them euler solved it in 3 minutes
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Did he?
 Westicles: well, okay maybe 10 at the most
 Westicles: I think I'll move it back to easy
 struct: I dont think you should use euler as a benchmark
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Btw, if I understood correctly, the discussion was more about the constraints validity, and that your solution couldn't work on valid extrem tests.
 Westicles: hmm, I think I tried it up to 150 words and it still worked
 Westicles: I don't get all the whining... it is a fine puzzle.
 jacek: but it promotes drugs overdose
 Westicles: I think perhaps they are just hidebound.  They don't like trying to solve puzzles that challenge them, or take them a little outside their comfort zone.  Sad, really.
 jacek: is that why nobody likes :notebook: :soccer:?
 Westicles: I'm afraid so
 jacek: :scream:
 JBM: it could use a more precise definition of what's meant by letters in common
 Westicles: Maybe... the example should make it clear, better than adding a bunch of legalistic text
 JBM: i didn't feel it did
 Westicles: you mean upper/lowercase?  or you thought two matching a's should count as one for some reason?
 JBM: could have read it wrong, but for both interpretations (I found) the answer is 2, though there are 1 or 2 possibilities
 JBM: second one
 JBM: first one is still the same letter (To me)
 JBM: wording to understand the second one is: “Xanax and Viagra have "A" in common”
 JBM: s/understand/feel/
 Westicles: You seem to have unusual interpretations on these things.  I remember you hated how the walls worked on 5D chess as well
 JBM: i don't remember 5d chess, so that's that
 Westicles: sorry, 5D Chests
 JBM: not much more i'm afraid
 Westicles: You made a video on it :P  Anyhow, we can add whatever text is needed to clarify
 JBM: for the first one (not for me, but I know people who fet it), “Drugs are case-insensitive” anywhere, e.g. Constraints
 JBM: for the second one, probably best to say what's compatible with what in the example *and how*
 JBM: I don't really see streaming as “making a video”---it's mostly improvised, fire and forget
 Westicles: okay, I tried to clear up the description.  thanks!
 JBM: "the same letter can match more than once" solves a problem but creates another :D
 JBM: now a and aa match twice
 Westicles: oh dear
 JBM: lol just saw you worked for ocp
 JBM: how's that valid and the rejected team turtle
 JBM: how discriminatory
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: I never understood the Turtle thing.
 Westicles: One more vote needed for the DAWG, that's the one I thought might have a little drama
 Coderboi270: ayo how do i do coders strike back
 Wontonimo: i can help you with that
 Wontonimo: how far have you gotten?
 Coderboi270: to the first boss race thin
 Wontonimo: have you gotten your pod to correctly aim at the checkpoints?
 Coderboi270: yes
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: okay, have you discovered you can change the thrust?
 Coderboi270: yes
 Coderboi270: but i dont know what to do
 Wontonimo: let me take a look at a replay of your bot ... give me 2 min
 Wontonimo: I dont' see you in the leaderboard
 Coderboi270: oh
 Wontonimo: can you share a replay please
 Coderboi270: ye
 Wontonimo: you can click on the 3dot K looking thing
 Wontonimo: right beside the gear
 Wontonimo: in the replay window
 Wontonimo: then send me the url of the new tab that opens
 Coderboi270: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/592228560">https://www.codingame.com/replay/592228560</a>
 Coderboi270: i dont know
 Coderboi270: how do i check
 Wontonimo: it does not look like you have discovered how to change the speed.  your pod is only going at 50
 Wontonimo: and it could go up to 100
 Wontonimo: try that and submit
 Coderboi270: ok
 JBM: no need to understand it to witness discrimination
 Wontonimo: wrong chat channel JBM
 JBM: doesn't appear so
 Wontonimo: although, you are correct none the less
 Westicles: but Zorg works for turtle...
 69razer69: whats the condition to get cp from optimazation
 Wontonimo: let me know when you are able to increase your speed to 100 instead of 50 then send me another replay Coderboi270
 Coderboi270: i did it
 jacek: :tada:
 Wontonimo: submit it and then send me a replay
 Wontonimo: oh, look, you are now on the leaderboard
 Coderboi270: ye
 Wontonimo: you are in wood 2
 69razer69: what are u playing guys
 Wontonimo: mad pod racing
 69razer69: oh i forget abt it 
 Wontonimo: are you gonna send a replay Coderboi270?  I can make more suggestions if you do
 Coderboi270: uh
 Coderboi270: of what
 69razer69: oh i was on the driffting part
 69razer69: wontonimo can i dm u later

 Coderboi270: ok
 Wontonimo: if you could somehow detect when you are close and reduce your thrust
 Wontonimo: do you know how to calculate distance between two points?
 Coderboi270: no
 Wontonimo: if you have x1,y1 and x2,y2 the distance is
 Coderboi270: um I dont know
 Wontonimo: square_root( square(x1-x2) + square(y1-y2) )
 Coderboi270: oh
 Wontonimo: you can use that formula to find distance between 2 points
 Coderboi270: k
 Wontonimo: with a quick google search you can even find how to do it in the language you are programming
 Coderboi270: im still confused
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: what about
 Coderboi270: everything
 Wontonimo: well, first there was a big bang
 Wontonimo: and electrons and protons were flying freely
 Wontonimo: then things cooled down enough for them to collect into atoms
 69razer69: lol
 Coderboi270: bruh
 Wontonimo: i'm kidding
 jacek: oO
 69razer69: that was a good one
 Wontonimo: let's start with one thing that is confusing
 Coderboi270: everything
 Wontonimo: ok.  how much experience do you have with programming?  Do you know about arrays and functions?
 Coderboi270: no i just started last night
 69razer69: aw
 Coderboi270: what
 69razer69: u started what
 Schwase: pod racing is easy, just make a program that evaluates literally every possible move for each turn and determine which one yields the least time to complete the race, duh
 Coderboi270: wha
 Schwase: sorry dont take that seriously, its a joke
 69razer69: i mean did u started programming last night or maths 
 Schwase: maybe try starting with something other than pod racing would be a good idea
 Coderboi270: like what
 69razer69: i know wontonimo gonna teach you some good stuff
 Coderboi270: ok
 69razer69: but u need to able to follow alogn with him
 Coderboi270: ok
 69razer69: and that requires some geometry knowldge (vectors-distances) and a basic programming skills
 Coderboi270: oh
 Wontonimo: hey Coderboi270, what programming language are you learning?
 Coderboi270: python
 NglQ: Guys I'm struggling a bit with finding the position of Thor
 NglQ: Any idea?
 NglQ: Just an hint is sufficent
 JBM: hint: you're the only one making it change
 JBM: so blame yourself
 Uljahn: you are given the initial position, then you choose a direction and update the position yourself in the loop 
 Westicles: click on hints on the left panel
 Wontonimo: see if you can find some intro to python videos or tutorials online Coderboi270.  There is this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a> for practicing
 Wontonimo: i've gotta go.  i'll be back in 40 min
 Coderboi270: ok thank
 Coderboi270: ima get off i will get back on later
 69razer69: how to open closed coc chat
 Wontonimo: if you lose the link, it's lost
 Westicles: unless you remember the name, you can /join
 Westicles: I think?
 Schwase: maybe not, i doubt that ALL of those chats get cached? seems like overkill
 Schwase: easy enough to find out, itll only take a few minutes, ill report back
 jacek: nothing happens in those chats anyway
 Schwase: crap
 Schwase: i had copied the name of the channel but overwrote my pastebin when i was doing the clash
 Schwase: lol
 TassosCodes: Hey there. Is there an option to see my solutions on the problems I already solved?
 TassosCodes: Im a noob
 Schwase: oh yeah it works
 Schwase: wait...
 Schwase: coc180514620802
 Schwase: can you join if you didnt do the clash?
 Schwase: someone else try joining that channel
 Wontonimo: just go here #coc180514620802
 Wontonimo: or type /join coc180514620802
 Schwase: oh i didnt know you can link channels like that
 Wontonimo: you have to have enough privilege 
 Wontonimo: I can sell you channels for 0.01 bitcoin each
 Wontonimo: okay okay .... how about 0.003 bitcoin each
 Schwase: hmmm
 Wontonimo: you drive a hard bargin Schwase ... 0.001 bitcoin each
 Schwase: ok
 Schwase: deal
 Schwase: i feel obligated to inform you i will be converting the threads into NFTs
 Wontonimo: your truthfulness is foolishly forthcoming, for I have preemptively converted this thread to an NFT
 Wontonimo: hmm, i find the ui here lacking.  In addition to "follow" button I'd like a "stalk" and "hunt" button
 Schwase: you know how we have a weird obsession with "ruined art"? I feel like the more meta this conversation gets the more "ruined art"-esque this NFT would become therefore increasing its value
 Dren: They don't make those buttons because it would take all the fun out of the hunt
 Wontonimo: lol x 2
 jacek: oO
 Schwase: is it cheating if i get my own puzzle in clash and go to the contribution and copy my answer lol

 Deaddrink: there are tutorials&gt;
 Coderboi270: i took a nap
 Wontonimo: on line, yes Deaddrink.  If you google "coding tutorials" you'll find them
 AntiSquid: all from australia&#160;? isn't everything locked down into oblivion over there&#160;?
 AntiSquid: well i kind of understand their frustrations now, wish you good health kids
 Schwase: omg i just learned something amazing

 Wontonimo: hey hey Thor!
 Wontonimo: what are you up to?
 Thorcode: this puzzle of the week
 Thorcode: and marslander 2
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: puzzle of the week seems funky
 Wontonimo: it's interesting that the coordinates are not provided for all the robots
 Wontonimo: seems like there isn't much point in moving in that game
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: i see one of the 'top' strategies is to move your tanks such that they form a checkerboard pattern
 Wontonimo: a NN solution to this seems like it would do the best.

 ZXC01: this is my code for power of thor.
 ZXC01: idk wheres wrong?
 Coderboi270: what
 Wontonimo: I've looked at your code
 ZXC01: i missed a and
 Wontonimo: tell me what it is trying to do
 ZXC01: go to the light of power?
 Wontonimo: haha of course
 Wontonimo: but, looking at your code I'm a bit puzzled of your strategy
 Wontonimo: what is your strategy for getting to the light
 ZXC01: erm
 Wontonimo: did you know you can go NE, NW, SE, SW&#160;?
 ZXC01: i know
 ZXC01: but idk how to use
 Wontonimo: can I propose another way of looking at the problem&#160;?
 ZXC01: ok?
 Wontonimo: it is easier if you instead solve 2 problems
 Wontonimo: first solve if moving N/S will get you closer
 ZXC01: ok
 Wontonimo: if so, save that to a variable.  if not, save an empty string to a variable
 Wontonimo: next, solve if moving W/E will get you closer
 ZXC01: wait so is x or y north and south?
 Wontonimo: similarly save that to a variable 
 Wontonimo: X is W/E , Y is N/S
 Wontonimo: read the description for more info
 ZXC01: ok thx lemme try
 Wontonimo: up and to the left is negative.  down and to the right is positive

 ZXC01: you just ban them?

 struct: I cant ban accounts higher than level 10
 ZXC01: really

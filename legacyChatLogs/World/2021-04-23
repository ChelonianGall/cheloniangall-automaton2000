 BigFatDecker: ok another problem im having is that when i try to open a steam with os.system or any of the commands to open an exe file it just ignores the command
 BigFatDecker: i put a speak statement so that i would know if it ran the command but it doesnt even get to that. it just prints what i said and moves on
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on OS, I pipe to a log file.  System can return info usually stuff like "file not found, etc."  check your paths and permissions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: even 1 stupid little ENV variable can screw things up
 _CtrlAltDel_: Hello nitekat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: os.system("runme &gt; log.txt"); exit(); ... maybe?
 nitekat: hi
 Alex-1: hi
 Chakib37: is anyone taking cs50 or top course
 ngman: dumbass
 BigFatDecker: im trying to make a virtual assistant in python how could i make my program say different things when the keyword is said such as where is says applying boost i want there also to be a chance that it just say boosting or some other variation what is a good way to do this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/e2QztaH6">https://pastebin.com/e2QztaH6</a>
 Uljahn: random.choice(["Boosting", "Using Boost", "Applying Boost"])
 BigFatDecker: that would work with the speak command also?

 Passifi: They are replacing us with machines . :scream:
 KiwiTae: Passifi yes and they start by german players  :3
 Alex-1: what
 Alex-1: but ehy
 Alex-1: why
 Alex-1: good
 Passifi: replacing german players with machines is like replacing a donkey with an ass. the same difference
 Passifi: just to cover my ass. Dear mods ass is an animal and not at all vulgar&#160;:)
 Alex-1: Passifi you are thinking to much
 jacek: oO
 Alex-1: hii jacek
 xiaoran: hello
 Azhy: hey
 BackoffJack999: hello
 MSmits: hey jacek, i think i got the multi-threading thing to work
 MSmits: still testing, but seems ok
 struct: That was fast
 MSmits: i didnt use a mutex on the node. I just have 6 processes that each have a locked node associated with them
 MSmits: then i dont pollute the database
 MSmits: yeah it wasnt that hard, because I already ran a separate process for a game (a sim in the meta)
 MSmits: so i just run more of them now and have to make sure they dont conflict is all
 MSmits: whenever I UCT, I count how many times each node is selected by ongoing games and I add that many visits. Functions similarly to virtual losses
 derjack: :tada:
 Marchete: are you parallelizing MCTS?
 MSmits: no, meta mcts
 MSmits: it's easier
 MSmits: because speed is no issue
 MSmits: with meta mcts, a simulation is a separate process running a game 
 MSmits: so i just run 6 of them now
 derjack: what do you mean each have locked node
 MSmits: I have an array of 6 locked gamestates
 MSmits: so when i select a node i just go through the list
 MSmits: see if its in there
 MSmits: 1 for each process
 MSmits: and each process also has their own selection array for the entire tree
 MSmits: so i can count for virtual losses
 MSmits: static readonly Guid[] locked = new Guid[PROCESS_COUNT];
 MSmits: crap no  pastebin
 derjack: spam
 MSmits: was expecting pastebin :P
 MSmits: does it not work at all currently?
 MSmits: or did i just paste too little code?
 struct: needed 1 more \n
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: for what game?
 MSmits: for uttt now, but i can easily adapt to any of them I guess
 MSmits: all my meta mcts are sort of similar
 Marchete: uttt again?
 Marchete: I mean
 MSmits: i was running an opening book experiment
 MSmits: 1M games, then CG bench, 2M games etc.
 MSmits: i was curious to see how much it actually helps
 MSmits: normally i would counterbook, but what if i dont, will it actually help me any
 MSmits: i just wanted to speed up the experiment a bit, was up to 3M, but it's a bit slow
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/4DUDIYq">https://imgur.com/a/4DUDIYq</a>
 MSmits: (each test is 400 games)
 Astrobytes: While you sleep, MetaSmits studies you...
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: its interesting how vs some players winrate drops a bunch with more games. I think it's because they are very deterministic and i just go into a region of play where they always win
 MSmits: (like recurse's NN)
 MSmits: should pick up again later, with more games
 derjack: and how long does 1m games take
 MSmits: depends on how early it is. the first million is the slowest because game sims start from the root. Later on they can be much faster. But generally, a week on 1 core
 MSmits: in connect4, it can be a day because games are ultra short now
 MSmits: they start, then solve after a few turns only (50 ms each)
 Marchete: :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire:
 Butanium: hey is there someone who already use both tooltip and viewport module at the same time for a cg project?
 MSmits: are you worried I set my house on fire with multithreading Marchete?
 MSmits: Butanium no idea what you're talking about 
 Butanium: I'm doing a multiplayer codin game
 Butanium: And I use the viewport module
 Butanium: which allow the player to move around anad zoom in/out
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: sounds advanced
 MSmits: you need struct
 MSmits: if he doesn't know, you're too advanced for us
 struct: I never used both modules together
 Butanium: MSmits: lol
 2kiran: where do i get the codes that are needed... new here
 struct: What do you mean?
 2kiran: well you have to write something for game to keep goin
 struct: you need to code it yeah
 2kiran: don't know how
 Astrobytes: Why are you here then?
 2kiran: to learn init
 Astrobytes: init blud, get me
 Astrobytes: You don't know any coding at all?
 2kiran: yh
 Astrobytes: yeah you do or yeah you don't
 2kiran: yh i don't
 Astrobytes: Right. Best to go do some tutorials and learn the basics first, this site assumes a basic working knowledge
 struct: The wsl2 thing works nice btw
 Astrobytes: So loops, conditional statements, logic etc
 2kiran: ok...
 Astrobytes: Ah cool struct
 Butanium: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sololearn.com/">https://www.sololearn.com/</a>
 Astrobytes: 2kiran: New people tend to go for python, lots of tutorials out there
 Astrobytes: But use whatever you feel OK with
 Butanium: check this 2kiran, there are basic tutorial here
 2kiran: cool
 MadKnight: are u ready for the contest Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: do you have a replay with u
 Butanium: ok it's not possible with the actual modules struct
 Butanium: *current
 MSmits: mmh interesting bug. I have a situation where it checks whether a node is in the DB and if not, it inserts it. But another thread will do this at the same time and then you get a key already exists exception
 MSmits: because the DB is slow, this is possible somehow
 Kitkat260: gm
 Scarfield: Device is leaving Astralis&#160;:'(
 Kitkat260: why
 struct: MSmits how will you fix this?
 MSmits: I think I will do a check earlier and make sure the function that does this only gets called once at a time. That seems to work ok
 MSmits: not sure if it may not cause a crash over a longer period of time. We'll see, parallelization is messy&#160;:)
 MSmits: even the word is messy
 struct: cant you have a list or something of pending inserts?
 MSmits: something like that could work. 
 MSmits: it would have to be a part of the meta mcts that is not parallelized
 MSmits: thats the main thing
 MSmits: but it also has to be inserted *before* it's being used by a parallelized part
 struct: Should I rotate the notation or amazons?
 struct: Or I should not bother?
 Astrobytes: I doesn't bother me tbh
 Astrobytes: But that's just me
 MSmits: if you want a second pair of eyes, let me look at it too
 MSmits: maybe it will bother me
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6127e5b918b4155e0536e89f7157029f30bc">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6127e5b918b4155e0536e89f7157029f30bc</a>
 MSmits: what exactly should be rotated/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 struct: 1-8
 Astrobytes: the ranks are backwards
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: well it helps a little bit if it is consistent with other games
 MSmits: though the other games are not consistent amongst themselves
 MSmits: but no need to add a completely new variations to the mix
 Astrobytes: doesn't affect anything, it's more aesthetic imo
 MSmits: it affects how you read input doesnt it?
 Astrobytes: Minimal disruption
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: but if it's easy to fix...
 MSmits: not sure if that's the case
 Astrobytes: teapot:  "I know it is quite a tricky change "
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: opinion?
 struct: its tricky if I dont make my code a mess
 Scarfield: agree with astro, i like it better as is, anyway its very clear how its set up
 struct: I can just make my code a mess and it gets fixed
 MSmits: ahh ok. Don't bother changing it then, you guys playtested it
 struct: readinput.replace(/\d//g,
 Scarfield: i havent tested, only looked at it, and my eyes were pleased
 MSmits: topleft being 1 kinda makes sense
 Scarfield: ^
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: wish all games had that
 struct: tell that to chess players
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: checkers is funny with the red pieces being called black
 MSmits: on input
 derjack: racists eh
 MSmits: not where i was going, but yeah sure&#160;:)
 Alex-1: Automaton2000 nice to meet you
 darkhorse64: afaik, amazons boards follow chess conventions
 Automaton2000: at least he has a good idea how to do the same thing i did to get to
 struct: you are right darkhorse
 darkhorse64: which is origin bottom left
 struct: I can change it, I dont mind at all
 struct: replace every digit by  9 - digit
 darkhorse64: I did the change for clobber

 ZarthaxX: hey
 Scarfield: oi
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hi
 ZarthaxX: howdy everyone&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: howdydoodayyy
 MSmits: doing good&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ZarthathustraxX
 ZarthaxX: :rofl: the f
 MSmits: he's been brooding on that all day
 Astrobytes: Like Zarathustra
 ZarthaxX: Atrobazy
 ZarthaxX: Astrobazy*
 ZarthaxX: mmmm
 Astrobytes: tf
 MSmits: tensorflow?
 ZarthaxX: it was like mixzing crazy with your name
 ZarthaxX: lmao the addiction MSmits :rofl:
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I *knew* you were gonna say tensorflow Smits
 MSmits: yeah i am predictable
 ZarthaxX: btw we defended our final project on wed
 ZarthaxX: the one with avx512 
 MSmits: why do you need to defend it?
 ZarthaxX: finally over :D
 Astrobytes: ah nice, well done
 ZarthaxX: "defend" -&gt; talk a bit about curiosoties
 MSmits: oh ok
 ZarthaxX: but well
 MSmits: wait is this like defending a thesis?
 MSmits: or something?
 ZarthaxX: he kind of wanted each of us to talk a bit, thats why
 Astrobytes: Yes
 ZarthaxX: it could count as one haha
 MSmits: ohh ok, this is for your studies ofc
 ZarthaxX: the teacher said there is potential for doing a thesis, haha
 MSmits: avx512 sounds like a nice project
 ZarthaxX: well it was sse, avx and avx512
 ANJACE_Z: what is avx512&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: coding with c with intrsiniscs and with asm
 ZarthaxX: it was a long one
 MSmits: ANJACE_Z do you know regular AVX?
 Astrobytes: I can imagine
 ZarthaxX: yeah, but well teacher loved it
 ANJACE_Z: no
 ZarthaxX: he liked that we went through many things
 MSmits: it's basically running things parallel at the level of individual operations. You can add numbers 8x at the same time, without having to use multiple threads or cores
 MSmits: 512 refers to the size of the register
 ZarthaxX: we mixed biology with another 2 subjects of the career, algorithms and low lvl coding
 struct: 512 bits o.o
 Astrobytes: biology eh
 MSmits: ANJACE_Z not just adding, a bunch of different operations, 100s
 ZarthaxX: anyway we got 10s&#160;:)
 MSmits: that's max grade right?
 ZarthaxX: yes 
 MSmits: cool, you kinda have to add that bit&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: thought i had :rofl:
 MSmits: some places use 100 as max
 Astrobytes: yeah, our standard grades in highschool used to go from 1 - 7. 1 being distinction and 7 being fail.
 ZarthaxX: i would be crying and wont have put that smiley face
 MSmits: 10 would be beyond fail
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 ZarthaxX: 1 best the f
 Astrobytes: You had to basically not turn up to get a 7
 MSmits: ours goes from 1 to 10, 10 being best, 1 being worst
 MSmits: it's weird because 0-1 doesnt exist
 Astrobytes: Not sure how it works now
 struct: 0-20
 MSmits: and in the US they use A's and B's and C's, because it makes so much  sense not to use numbers...
 Scarfield: you can get -3 as worst grade in dk, might have been changed though
 ZarthaxX: some teachers have tried to put 0 lol
 Astrobytes: It's not that weird ZarthaxX, I mean A B, C, D, E etc is accepted for grading
 ZarthaxX: i know that one
 Astrobytes: -3vel?
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: -3 is a really weird minimum
 ZarthaxX: smito you would like the project, paralellizing dynamic programming algorithm
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: sounds fun
 ZarthaxX: different approach than the usual
 MSmits: just parallelized my meta mcts. Not with avx though, just cores
 ZarthaxX: it is
 ZarthaxX: ah but that one is less fun :rofl:
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: but useful
 Scarfield: yea, there was a lot of talk about changing it, but i dont know if it ever was changed. pretty bad for average grade to get a minus
 Westicles: When I was a kid the grades were E,S,M,I,F
 ZarthaxX: i mean scores are in contiguous memory in a 1d array, seems easy..
 MSmits: i meta mcts ZarthaxX? They aren't for me
 MSmits: i use a persistent dictionary saved on SSD
 ZarthaxX: what?
 MSmits: to store nodes
 Astrobytes: Exemplary, Shitty, Mega-Shitty, Idiot and Fk Off What Is this, Westicles?
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 ZarthaxX: thought you were calculating the scores for selection phase
 Westicles: Hmmm.  Excellent and Fail, not sure about the rest
 ZarthaxX: with simd
 MSmits: well i do that too
 MSmits: nooo
 MSmits: i dont use simd anywhere
 ZarthaxX: oh, ok
 ZarthaxX: you meant like threading
 MSmits: i just meant i parallelized by using more than 1 core
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 MSmits: each core runs a game instance
 Astrobytes: Well, I was close I guess :P
 ZarthaxX: so you are messing with threads?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: it's messing with processes
 MSmits: C# also has multithreading, its actually different
 ZarthaxX: and managing collisions between them...
 MSmits: yeah
 ZarthaxX: ah
 Westicles: "ESMIF - An old grading scale used in schools in the late 1940s and 50s" :older_man:
 MSmits: but it's a C# program running C++ binaries
 ZarthaxX: so different processes running on same time
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 MSmits: yeah
 ZarthaxX: you run multiple c++
 MSmits: exactly
 ZarthaxX: c# program is responsible for writing results tho
 MSmits: to SSD dictionary yeah
 ZarthaxX: ah so no collisions
 ZarthaxX: seems easier then haha
 MSmits: well i had some issues when two processes were done at the same time, but i think i fixed them
 Astrobytes: Westicles: ...and on through the 60s and early 70s (possibly later). Stood for E - excellent, S - superior , M - medium or average, I - inferior, F - failure
 ZarthaxX: dirty hack? :P
 MSmits: I think it might be dirty yeah
 MSmits: edge case
 Astrobytes: The best kind of hacky
 ZarthaxX: there are some concepts for multiuthreading that idk if they apply to your case
 ZarthaxX: as i dont really know how you are managing the writing results part
 MSmits: the process being done calls an event then that activates backpropagation and such. The main thing is starting a new selection phase. That can cause issues
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: well
 MSmits: I just have a boolean at the start of that function now, if one already started, i just return immediately
 MSmits: and if not, it checks all processes one after a time and refreshes them
 ZarthaxX: okey :P
 ZarthaxX: well for multithreading you have concepts like mutexes
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.mutex?view=net-5.0">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.mutex?view=net-5.0</a>
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX o**
 MSmits: i kind of use a mutex
 ZarthaxX: hi kiwoo&#160;:*
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: i got a 10 kiwooo ~~
 ZarthaxX: lol
 KiwiTae: last time i did multithreading with matlab still gettin nightmares
 MSmits: sounds hard&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX awesome&#160;! gj genuis
 MSmits: is matlab like mathematica&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: ty :D
 KiwiTae: a bit i guess , mostly scripting its not oo friendly
 Westicles: matlab indexes start with 1, if that tells you anything
 jacek: :scream:
 KiwiTae: Westicles &gt;&lt;
 MSmits: ack 1
 MSmits: like visual basic
 jacek: huh
 Westicles: indices I should say
 MSmits: visual basic for windows applications i mean
 MSmits: not sure if thats different, but it started at 1 afaik
 MSmits: it's not even the worst part of VBA
 Astrobytes: everything about VB and VBA is the worst
 MSmits: yeah

 WannaBeHum1n: guys in coders strike back does both of the pods need to get in the checkmark to get the next&#160;?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: each pod does its own race
 MSmits: best pod wins
 MSmits: if its one of yours, you win
 KiwiTae: there are tons of people using one pod to mess with the other player
 MSmits: it's the only way to win really. 
 Therabidpanther: you are eventually responsible for multiple pods?
 MSmits: one pod races, the other messes
 MSmits: 2
 WannaBeHum1n: i made one block a certain checkpoint and the other do the race like in previous leagues, the one supposed to be racing doesnt recieve the new coords
 KiwiTae: Therabidpanther 2 in gold i think
 KiwiTae: not sure ~
 MSmits: WannaBeHum1n if you do the checkpoints in the correct order, it should
 MSmits: so you're doing something wrong
 KiwiTae: Westicles u must be messing up with the input parsin 
 MSmits: KiwiTae who are you talking to?
 Astrobytes: lol
 KiwiTae: no idea xd im distracted
 MSmits: lol
 WannaBeHum1n: so for testing I am printing the nextCheckPointId and it seems it doesnt  update even when pod number one is leterally standing on it
 struct: Are you reading all the inputs?
 MSmits: if your program is pretty simple, it would be ok to paste it here so we can take a look at it
 MSmits: not if its advanced and people may steal it ofc
 WannaBeHum1n: it is the default code
 MSmits: did you reset it after promotion?
 MSmits: the input changes
 WannaBeHum1n: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/upm02rZV">https://pastebin.com/upm02rZV</a>
 WannaBeHum1n: here
 H7: Yeah, I stole it.
 struct: I think sometimes its hard to keep track on which frame you are
 MSmits: does the next checkpoint id never change?
 MSmits: or just in that one frame you're expecting it to
 WannaBeHum1n: the nextxheckpointid doesnt change
 MSmits: also, is this JS? 
 MSmits: I am wondering about this:
 MSmits: const nextCheckPointId = parseInt(inputs[5]);
 WannaBeHum1n: yes senior
 MSmits: const
 MSmits: does that mean it never changes?
 WannaBeHum1n: no it can change
 MSmits: not sure about JS
 WannaBeHum1n: i ll change it
 WannaBeHum1n: to tr
 Therabidpanther: wait, const can change?
 Therabidpanther: whats the point of not using let then lol
 Astrobytes: JS for ya
 struct: the code works
 MSmits: you tested it?
 MSmits: are you in gold?
 struct: its same for legend
 WannaBeHum1n: still
 WannaBeHum1n: even when changed to let
 WannaBeHum1n: the nextCheckpointid updates when the two ppods are on it

 UnnamedCodinGamer: any ideas how to get the info?
 WannaBeHum1n: struct
 struct: when the pod is at middle of checkpoint
 struct: it was still 0
 struct: 1*
 WannaBeHum1n: after that
 struct: on previous turn
 struct: thats why it says 1
 WannaBeHum1n: does it keep updating&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: do u get 3
 WannaBeHum1n: 4
 WannaBeHum1n: and so on&#160;?*
 struct: no
 struct: your pod only goes to checkpoint 1
 struct: the reason is simple
 struct: your other pod checkpoint id is 1
 struct: you are assuming both pods checkpoint id are the same 
 WannaBeHum1n: isn't&#160;?
 struct: no
 WannaBeHum1n: how do i get each
 WannaBeHum1n: seperetaly&#160;?
 struct: its given for each pod
 Astrobytes: No, like Smits said earlier, they are essentially each running their own race
 Astrobytes: that's why the info is separate
 WannaBeHum1n: next check point id of your pod
 WannaBeHum1n: next check point id of the opponent's pod

 TeeAir: i think it's "Cerveza"
 MSmits: ineenkrimpen
 TeeAir: XD
 MSmits: noone says that
 TeeAir: Is this dutch&#160;?
 MSmits: the reverse translation of the dutch word ineenkrimpen
 MSmits: ineenkrimpenshrink, shrivel, cower, cringe, flinch
 MSmits: so it's not exactly cringe either
 struct: cerveza is spanish, in portuguese its cerveja, it means bear beer

 GIPOKE: im stuck
 GIPOKE: im new here
 ShortBaited: whats your problem?
 GIPOKE: im on the coders strike back tutorial and dont know what to do please help
 GIPOKE: im using java
 ShortBaited: uhm
 GIPOKE:&#160;?
 ShortBaited: gemme some time
 GIPOKE: im not a really experienced coder
 ShortBaited: i did Coders Strike Back in C++
 ShortBaited: Where do you stuck at?
 GIPOKE: the first thing
 GIPOKE: it says edit this line to output the target something
 GIPOKE: i literally have no idea what to do
 KiwiTae: you read game input on stdin and print output on stdout
 GIPOKE: oh wait i did the first step!
 GIPOKE: now i have to deal with something about thrust
 GIPOKE: im starting to get it all i had to do was look at the console
 GIPOKE: yay im in wood 3
 WannaBeHum1n: gj
 Kitkat260: hi

 HackNinja: I dont understand the mars launcher epsiode 1
 Kitkat260: me nither
 HackNinja: hi are yu a python user
 Kitkat260: yes
 HackNinja: Wow 
 HackNinja: so i guess we can work this out right
 HackNinja: hello 
 HackNinja: hellllooooo
 jacek: huh
 HackNinja: :hushed:
 GIPOKE: im stuck on defibrillators
 Roxxx: so i was just in a clash of code
 Roxxx: and the task was
 HackNinja: was what
 Roxxx: to generate english words out of scrambled words
 Roxxx: how would you even do that without uploading a whole dictionary?
 Smelty: augh i died on 2048 with 230000 score

 GIPOKE: im using javascript
 GIPOKE: so if readline() reads from stdin
 GIPOKE: what reads from stdout?
 GIPOKE: how do i create a thrust variable if it isnt in the game input?
 struct: you can create it
 Dreyfuzz: fuck
 GIPOKE: alright wood 1
 jacek: :tada:
 Kitkat260: hey sorry
 WannaBeHum1n: congrats
 WannaBeHum1n: guys is he x speed and y speed the same as velocity&#160;?
 ilovebiscuits: What is the calculation they use for a collision?
 jacek: if you dont know, use muzero. ezpz
 ilovebiscuits: Is that really what you do? That just seems like such a unnecessarily complicated workaround?
 jacek: that was a little trolling from my part. pardon me
 Astrobytes: oO
 Marchete: ...
 GIPOKE: how do you wait a few seconds in coders strike back? (javascript)
 Astrobytes: ilovebiscuits: Take a read of this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 GIPOKE: oh im getting so close to bronze
 ilovebiscuits: thx @Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: np ilovebiscuits
 GIPOKE: i put an and and then and or so which takes precedence?
 GIPOKE: ok so c1 &amp;&amp; c2 || c3
 Marchete: just don't
 GIPOKE: y
 Marchete: use parenthesis
 GIPOKE: ok
 jacek: if its javascript, i wouldnt be surprised if it were random
 ArtifaxXx: =)
 Marchete: on JS you get an string
 Marchete: a*
 GIPOKE: im on JS yeah
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: just kidding
 jacek: im on crack, still better than js
 Marchete: but it's not recommended mix &amp;&amp; and || at the same level
 Marchete: (a &amp;&amp; (b || c))
 Astrobytes: cracek
 Marchete: ((a &amp;&amp; b) || c)
 GIPOKE: what i did yeag
 GIPOKE: *yeah
 GIPOKE: im in the wood 1 arena and sometimes im winning sometimes im losing
 Marchete: CSB?
 GIPOKE: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, as Marchete is pointing out *always* make your intention clear with parantheses (for your own sanity as well as precedence)
 BackoffJack999: hello
 Marchete: even some compilers warn you
 Astrobytes: CG IDE does for C++
 GIPOKE: ok ill remember that
 Astrobytes: When it works
 Gabbek: Good evening everyone
 Marchete: new  CG IDE works pretty well
 GIPOKE: hmm maybe i need to tweak the distances
 Marchete: good intellisense
 Astrobytes: :wave: Gabbek
 Gabbek: Astrobytes - how's the boss?&#160;:)
 Marchete: GIPOKE do you know our savior -3vel?
 Astrobytes: Marchete: yeah, it's a helluva improvement over the last one
 GIPOKE: ok so instead of 8000 i put 9000 lets see how that goes
 GIPOKE: Marchete&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Gabbek: yeah, done, gave it to struct
 Gabbek: sweet, that amazon game looks pretty fun, I'll add it to my endless queue of CG content :D
 Astrobytes: Thanks for the testing last night
 GIPOKE: hmm what went wrong
 GIPOKE: for some reason it looks like parentheses arent working
 Astrobytes: GIPOKE: -3 * velocity
 GIPOKE: my pod boosted while it was super close to the boss and that set me off course but that wasnt supposed to happen
 GIPOKE: velocity? im in wood 1
 GIPOKE: i dont have access to velocity yet
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you can calculate it
 GIPOKE: i have thrust but i dont have speed
 struct: hi, I should add it soon
 struct: today/tomorrow
 Astrobytes: No rush struct, just whenever you're ready
 Scarfield: No, rush

 Smelty: woaw
 Smelty: cool

 King_Coda: Anyways, how are you guys doing
 Clash_of_Cock: not good my name is displayed wrong
 struct: refresh
 Astrobytes: King_Coda: Same as yesterday. And you're still on an emoji spamming warning.
 Clash_of_Cock: test
 King_Coda: right, sorry
 Clash_of_Cock: refresh didn't help 
 Gabbek: I've never heard of name being displayed wrong issue, hmm
 King_Coda: I see ClashofPlop
 King_Coda: its fine for me
 Astrobytes: ClashofPlop so is that supposed to be amusing or what
 Finnya: anybody has advice for a total beginner? what "game" is best to start?
 jacek: do you have any programming knowledge?
 Astrobytes: Username violates community guidelines
 Gabbek: Finnya what's your goal? Learn to program, or you want to start with some easy practice exercises?
 Finnya: want to learn python 3 
 jacek: try easy puzzles first
 Finnya: i started with basic already, but its very basic
 Gabbek: then I would suggest jet brains academy - you can get month for free
 Gabbek: and come back to CG for some exercise practice once you feel a bit more comfortable&#160;:)
 Clash_of_Cock: t
 Finnya: ^^ so this is not quite the right start for a beginner=
 Finnya:&#160;?
 Andriamanitra: i'm sure you could figure it out but it's probably better to go through some tutorial first
 Finnya: :D okay, thanks 
 Andriamanitra: i think codingame is better for getting better once you know the basics than actually teaching the basics
 jacek: CG is not for total beginner. its for improving what you know now
 Finnya: well, just wait for me&#160;;) one day i will be back :D
 Gabbek: sure thing, we'll be around&#160;:)
 Finnya: allright, then see you then!

 Astrobytes: Which is good
 jacek: content maybe?
 jacek: good? yesterday you complained
 Astrobytes: Those weren't 'new people'
 BlaiseEbuth: Yé! Tibo will be happy!
 Astrobytes: Only if they want fun and don't like competing
 BlaiseEbuth: A lot of new active account, and a proportional diminution of the 5%.
 Astrobytes:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: tbf though it wasn't so much Tibo
 jacek: tibo?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't worry, you will be able to pay to play escape games instead of doing contests.
 AntiSquid: what's the percentage of clashers&#160;? was that made public&#160;?
 AntiSquid: hardcore religious zealot type of clashers i mean
 BlaiseEbuth: No. But they are the heavy majority.
 BlaiseEbuth: According the organizers.
 AntiSquid: so we need more clash contests
 AntiSquid: with ads, easy money
 BlaiseEbuth: At least 200% of the community is composed of clashers.
 Astrobytes: 195%
 BlaiseEbuth: No there's also the non-competitive non-clasher.
 Astrobytes: Oh right, true
 BlaiseEbuth: 200/95/5
 Astrobytes: Anyway, the salty taste in my mouth is too strong
 jacek: get covid [solved]
 AntiSquid: salty taste of whast
 AntiSquid: from what
 Astrobytes: Salt.
 BlaiseEbuth: I have not seasoned yet.
 Astrobytes: I had covid jacek, my taste and smell were no worse than a usual cold. My mother totally lost her sense of taste and smell, as did some friends. It's not guaranteed.
 BlaiseEbuth: You had a bad covid, ask for a refund.
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jacek: totally permanently?
 Astrobytes: No, it's recently started to come back properly (for my mother at least), in the past few months, so about a year of that
 jacek: she could join CG and not be bothered then
 AntiSquid: does covid impact taste of humour btw&#160;?
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: Definitely not
 AntiSquid: oh wait i had to self isolate :thinking:
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 am i funny to you&#160;?
 Automaton2000: there is a new contest

 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 GIPOKE: agh i cant geta good formula for when to boost
 BlaiseEbuth: What league?
 GIPOKE: wood 1
 Astrobytes: first turn if checkpoint &gt; some distance? Then if not, if you're behind, boost?
 BlaiseEbuth: Boost is not important. You can go gold without using it.
 GIPOKE: im trying to find that distance
 GIPOKE: BlaiseEbuth already tried that
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Blaise is correct. I mean we must've mentioned -3vel 100 times already
 BlaiseEbuth: Not a secret anymore
 GIPOKE: what angle
 GIPOKE: alright
 GIPOKE: instead of having it be thrust 0 on the turns i made it thrust 40 and it worked
 Astrobytes: you know how to calculate velocity if you've been reading the chat right
 GIPOKE: thrust isnt speed
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Do you have a brick wall spare that I can bang my head against?
 VizGhar: :D try floor... it's always somewhere nearby
 Astrobytes: heh heh :D
 BlaiseEbuth: I've some yes. I can give you one if you need it.
 GIPOKE: wait what
 GIPOKE: i went down 8970 places in the arena in under a millisecond
 BlaiseEbuth: I went down to Georgia. But that's another story...
 Astrobytes: Look, calculate your velocity ffs
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: hahaha
 GIPOKE: im on coders strike back
 GIPOKE: the area is 16000 x 9000 and the pods can go outside the area too
 GIPOKE: im confused
 GIPOKE: stop using too many abbreviations
 VizGhar: try reading forum GIPOKE there are a lot of ideas
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh! Everything take sense now!
 Astrobytes: CALCULATE YOUR VELOCITY.SPEED IS NOT VELOCITY. THRUST IS A FORCE.Velocity! Calculate it!
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes you don't understand, he is on Coders strike back...
 GIPOKE: oh thats why i couldnt understand
 voidnull: how do you calculate speed?
 voidnull: making differential of previous position?
 GIPOKE: so a 16000 x 9000 unit board the pods can go outside the area
 Astrobytes: Velocity damnit
 GIPOKE: thrust goes from 0 to 100 and there is a boost option
 Astrobytes: yes
 GIPOKE: i dont see how youre helping
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah yeah, don't need to copy paste the whole statement in the chat.
 Astrobytes: Calculate your displacement from your previous position or so help me BlaiseEbuth I will be realllllllyyyyy peeved.
 BlaiseEbuth: :popcorn:
 GIPOKE: now tell me smart how do i calculate that
 Astrobytes: (I used your name rather than god Blaise, hope you don't mind :P )
 GIPOKE: reminder im in wood 1 league
 BlaiseEbuth: That's ok, I forgive you. :3
 Astrobytes: You know your current position, store your last position
 VizGhar: uf... Astrobytes... you are flooding chat
 Astrobytes: The displacement will be...
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: Yes! With answers!
 VizGhar: i know i know... funny how basic math/physics/common sense is missing here
 Astrobytes: It's literally been suggested for hours
 GIPOKE: you know what i dont need help ill just keep experimenting
 Astrobytes: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR CURRENT POD POSITION AND YOUR LAST POD POSITION FROM THE PREVIOUS TURN.
 Astrobytes: I refuse to give you code
 BlaiseEbuth: He is not asking for "math/physics/common sense", he's asking for help! Seriously Astrobytes, that's a shame that, as a moderator, you're not even trying to help beginners...
 Astrobytes: &lt;3
 BlaiseEbuth: :hugging:
 Astrobytes: Well said :D
 GIPOKE: ahha
 GIPOKE: i got to bronze take that
 GIPOKE: and level 5
 Astrobytes: Pff. Don't mind me. I know nothing.
 therealbeef: achieving things by yourself is always more rewarding&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: JohnSnowBytes
 Astrobytes: I too got to CSB gold without -3vel. I even had an offline visualisation.I wish I'd used -3vel
 Astrobytes: If the information given in gold was available in lower leagues, we wouldn't need -3vel

 VizGhar: Is there any cost difference in C++ when making array of 10items vs array of 10.000?
 ZarthaxX: you mean using new
 VizGhar: yes
 ZarthaxX: it depends on the SO i guess, how fast does it find you that chunk of memory
 ZarthaxX: obv 10k might be harder 
 ZarthaxX: you should benchmark it anyway&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: SO = OS, operating system
 struct: and the difference will probably not only be in making it
 VizGhar: hmm true... (by cost i mean computation cost, but you guessed right)
 ZarthaxX: struct mhm?
 struct: ZarthaxX if I have 1mill nodes vs 10k there is a difference
 struct: 10k will probably fit all in cache
 ZarthaxX: that's why i said benchmark
 VizGhar: If I use them struct
 ZarthaxX: what?
 struct: yeah
 ZarthaxX: but he didnt say using it
 ZarthaxX: he said "making"
 ZarthaxX: creating, allocating
 struct: I know, thats why I said
 VizGhar: :D i have to be more specific next time
 ZarthaxX: should ban this ambigous teacher :D
 ZarthaxX: anyway, benchmark it 
 ZarthaxX: i guess it may make no difference at all, because the numbers as small
 VizGhar: aintnobodygottimeforthis

 EngrJeprii: Hi DNA_HR
 DNA_HR: guys
 VizGhar: I just don't want to use vectors on CG and C++ isn't my language of choice
 EngrJeprii: Vectors is easy to use
 DNA_HR: vektor magtatanggol
 ZarthaxX: why not VizGhar?
 EngrJeprii: Vector Wood
 mayoljonathan: konichiyawa mina san
 Astrobytes: If you want to be really efficient, you're OK with vectors if you don't resize them VizGhar
 EngrJeprii: Yes, I agree with you.
 struct: vector&lt;int&gt; vec(10000);
 EngrJeprii: std::vectpr&lt;int&gt; vec = {1, 2,  3}
 VizGhar: Isn't resizing basically only reason why to use vectors over arrays?
 VizGhar: But I guess that this is more of a question for google
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but, we're on CG
 Astrobytes: also, vectors are a little more versatile.
 struct: Wait I think Viz is having the same dilema as me
 Astrobytes: C arrays vs vectors?
 struct: no
 jacek: there is std:array
 VizGhar: what is your dilema?

 VizGhar: I've started most of problems here on CG by implementing them in kotlin and then rewriting them in C++ (if it was slow) I gave up most of the time while rewriting, since it was too boring.
 Astrobytes: hush now XeroxarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Too boring!
 VizGhar: don't know proper word in english
 Astrobytes: If you mean it was boring then it was boring! Tedious perhaps?
 VizGhar: translator says yes :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes:  Don't use C++ then!
 Astrobytes: It's not like you *have* to. 
 Astrobytes: Kotlin should be fast enough for most problems (perhaps a few multis might be exceptions if you want to reach legend)
 VizGhar: Don't know why, but I'd like to. What do you think Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: do you get the first 2 or 3 turns

 UnnamedCodinGamer: can anyone check next move values on search race in their own simulation?
 VizGhar: Thank you guys
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I get an error after around 50 moves which seems strange
 struct: off by 1 error?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: angle 268 to 250 instead to 257 which the engine expects
 UnnamedCodinGamer: out of the blue it seems
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: Plenty C++ people around most of the time if you have questions 
 Astrobytes: rounding/truncation thing UnnamedCodinGamer?
 struct: so you rotated 18 and referee gives 257?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I go to the same point coordinates for 600 moves locally
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it handles one collision as it should
 UnnamedCodinGamer: then there are no more collisions
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and around move 50 I get this error
 struct: very strange that it takes 50 moves&#160;:/
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 Astrobytes: Did you adapt your CSB code or write something new?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I start the simulation on the last good move parameters for one move and get exactly the same result
 UnnamedCodinGamer: so there should be no error adding up
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have not tried CSB
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this pod stuff is new land to me
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but it seems strange to have this after 50 moves
 VizGhar: isnt 18 maximum allowed rotation? Maybe you really rotated just by those 9 degrees
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do not  use rotation angles as input
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will test it with angles and see what happens
 struct: I doubt is the referee that has the problem, many people played this game and had no problems
 UnnamedCodinGamer: no
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am not saying that
 struct: More people had this problem?

 therealbeef: i usually use combination of min/max to do that kind of bounding. new = old + min( 18, max( -18, delta ) )

 Astrobytes: struct I think it's a java thing for returning the sign of a float
 King_Coda: struct, I now fully appreciate the cleverness of your username
 Astrobytes: returns like 1.0 or 0.0 or -1.0
 struct: I see
 struct: I dont really see anything wrong with that code
 struct: I usually do it different though
 struct: I dont aim to points, I use angles
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have the method that handles angle input 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: It worked fine on first sight
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will test it for more moves
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and it will probably be the one that I will be using
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but still strange

 King_Coda: Have we all greeted each other?
 _OooooOYeaah_: Hi guys
 itik: Hi
 ilovebiscuits: Hi
 itik: GoodMorningAfternoon
 i_kevs: Please teach me how to code
 King_Coda: hi
 i_kevs: Anyone?
 i_kevs: Teach me to code
 King_Coda: I know two HTML5 things and two C++ things
 King_Coda: that's it
 Astrobytes: i_kevs: Use another website
 kresteodymium: i_kevs: use thenewboston on yt
 therealbeef: such code much compile
 King_Coda: g++ code.cpp
 Astrobytes: did you learn -S, -c or -o options yet King_Coda?
 King_Coda: i learned -o
 King_Coda: im working on variables right now

 ZarthaxX: whats a variable?
 Astrobytes: Keep learning how the compiler works too
 Astrobytes: well surely you'd return score from that
 ZarthaxX: why? that adds complexity, totally unnecesary
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: Variables are variable
 ZarthaxX: gonna report you for that
 Astrobytes: Also ZarthaxX: I don't mean 'under the hood' so much, just basic understanding of  wtf they do
 King_Coda: I believe ZarthaxX is trolling
 Astrobytes: Ya think
 King_Coda: I believe so, yes.
 Astrobytes:  /ban ZarthaxX for all time
 King_Coda: RIP ZarthaxX
 King_Coda: Oh well, moving on
 Astrobytes: How many times can we ping ZarthaxX
 King_Coda: I wonder. Seems like an interesting thing to do to ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: thoughts?
 King_Coda: I wonder if ZarthaxX would appreciate that
 Astrobytes: I think ZarthaxX would
 King_Coda: Yeah ZarthaxX, what do you think?
 King_Coda: I think ZarthaxX would too
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX loves getting pinged and not being able to respond
 King_Coda: That's just the type of person ZarthaxX is
 Marchete: please stop pinging ZarthaxX, that's annoying
 King_Coda: You're right, we should apologise to ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: Poor ZarthaxX
 King_Coda: I'm sorry ZarthaxX
 ilovebiscuits: Wish you well ZarthaxX
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX must be seeing a sea of red right now
 Astrobytes: Is this the Great ZarthaxX Ping of 2021?
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX may go down in history as the most pinged user of 2021
 King_Coda: Maybe ZarthaxX would like that
 Astrobytes: I donno, I feel ZarthaxX will take his revenge on me :D
 King_Coda: I don't think ZarthaxX can do much
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX might be able to make an alt account
 King_Coda: But if ZarthaxX did that, we would know
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX will get me back
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX is very predictable
 Astrobytes:  ZarthaxX is a cool dude
 UnnamedCodinGamer: King_Coda, he might be able to get to your ip address and delete your harddisk
 King_Coda: Oh no, I hope ZarthaxX doesnt "delete my hard disk"
 Astrobytes: And download ALL your memory
 King_Coda: You know, the one ZarthaxX knows I don't have
 Marchete: :regional_indicator_z::regional_indicator_a::regional_indicator_r::regional_indicator_t::regional_indicator_h::regional_indicator_a::regional_indicator_x::regional_indicator_x:
 King_Coda: LOL
 UnnamedCodinGamer: do not underestimate it guys
 Marchete: :regional_indicator_p::regional_indicator_u::regional_indicator_t::regional_indicator_o:
 Marchete: he won't reply
 Astrobytes: yes Marchete! :rofl:
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX should know that I have a laptop with an ssd
 King_Coda: ZarhaxX should also know that I only have 4 gb of memory
 <b>**Marchete asks everyone to avoid pinging ZarthaxX</b></p><p><img src="/a/52585602975098" /> <b>**King_Coda agrees with Marchete's statement</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> <b>**Astrobytes doesn't give a damn :P</b>
 ilovebiscuits: If we keep going on about ZarthaxX, then ZarthaxX will DDOS, then ZarthaxX will create a ZarthaxXware just for us, then, worst of all, ZarthaxX will have us wiped off ZarthaxX's codingame platform
 King_Coda: all 4 gb of my memory is filled willed random images i either A: found on the internet or B: edited to make them funny
 King_Coda: willed?
 King_Coda: *with
 King_Coda: Oh no, ZarthaxX. Please dont do this ZarthaxX!!!
 Astrobytes: You filled your memory with willpower
 King_Coda: Yes. Pure willpower.
 Astrobytes: Alright alright, give our boi ZarthaxX a break now
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop assaulting ZarthaxX or I will crack down.
 King_Coda: I feel like ZarthaxX has just closed out the website entirely
 Astrobytes: On what Blaise?
 King_Coda: he just got tired of all the pings and left to get a sandwich
 ilovebiscuits: ZarthaxX is still on the participants list
 Astrobytes: NO MOAR PINGS
 King_Coda: The participants list updates slowly
 BlaiseEbuth: Roar Astrobytes!
 King_Coda: oh dear, its 2012 all over again
 Astrobytes: RAAAR HERE ME ROAR, FOR I AM LEO
 King_Coda: RAR XD
 King_Coda: RAWRRRRRRR
 Astrobytes: rarbg?
 King_Coda: LOL
 King_Coda: rbg powered by the fierce souls of the 2012 roleplayers
 Astrobytes: I don't get your 2012 reference
 King_Coda: Lot's of roleplaying websites were made in that year
 King_Coda: it was a whole thing, i never really got into it
 Astrobytes: Please remember I am 38
 King_Coda: it took me a few seconds to get your rgb joke Astrobytes. i'm slowly getting accustomed to your humor
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes, I thought you were young...&#160;:(
 Ryanqazwsx: how to do Code vs Zombie lvl 1?
 Astrobytes: I am
 King_Coda: What do you mean, 38 is young!
 Astrobytes: Aren't you like 20-something Blaise?
 BlaiseEbuth: Old man... :older_man:
 ZarthaxX: 38???¡??¡
 ZarthaxX: WTF
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah...
 Marchete: :rofl:
 King_Coda: OH NO HE HATH RETURNED
 ZarthaxX: my dude is dying D:
 ilovebiscuits: Hi ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: Yes ZarthaxX - I am your father
 ZarthaxX: hellou
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i knew it!
 ZarthaxX: now gimme money
 King_Coda: ZarthaxX, how did you fell about us pinging you constantly
 Astrobytes: I don't fking have any!
 King_Coda: *feel
 ZarthaxX: it's ok lol
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes fake dad :P
 Astrobytes: You still love me right
 ZarthaxX: yes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: aww :hugging:
 King_Coda: What? Astrobytes can you be my dad too?
 Astrobytes: Thanks son
 King_Coda: I'll help pay rent
 BlaiseEbuth: You're a good grandpa Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth will help you with that kind of thing King_Coda
 King_Coda: awwwww
 King_Coda: Blaise, will you be my dad?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... :thinking:
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: I still feel 21 mentally (in some respects), my body feels 58 but hey
 Astrobytes: Anyway, most of 5% CG is older than you anyway
 BlaiseEbuth: anyway
 King_Coda: nevermind, i have no need for a dad
 King_Coda: I will be my own dad
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm ze boi
 King_Coda: toodaloo
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I failed to remove the extra 'anyway'. Senility obviously.
 Astrobytes: Is that a Mississippi Uptown Toodeloo though King_Coda
 BlaiseEbuth: I've to wake up early tomorrow. So I'll go to sleep now... Greasy Noodles all!
 Astrobytes: Giant Normans to you BlaiseEbuth
 Uljahn: MP ref?
 Ryanqazwsx: can anybody give me the code for lvl 1 code vs zombie?
 Ryanqazwsx: it will help greatly since im so confused
 airzocker: but then you won't learn much? xD i mean if it's too hard maybe do smth else first or is it more the game/how the inputs outputs work? (i've never done that one before)
 AntiSquid: "Anyway, most of 5% CG is older than you anyway"
 Ryanqazwsx: @airzocker can you at least tell me how to move and shoot the zombies?
 Ryanqazwsx: since I can even move or shott
 Astrobytes: Uljahn: Nope, but it sure does sound like one
 Ryanqazwsx: shoot
 airzocker: i can take a quick look ;D
 Ryanqazwsx: k thanks
 Uljahn: ah, it was Spiny Norman
 Ryanqazwsx: here is my code I have no idea what is going on
 Ryanqazwsx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f85523b5-2242-4cd5-8249-a2ba604abe86">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f85523b5-2242-4cd5-8249-a2ba604abe86</a>
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Procent?
 voidnull: you all using python?
 AntiSquid: 11 PM, mixing up languages
 airzocker: @Ryanqazwsx haven't looked into your code yet, what language are you using?
 Ryanqazwsx: Py
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid
 airzocker: ok, i know that at least a bit ;D
 therealbeef: the shooting is automatic
 therealbeef: automatic rifle
 Ryanqazwsx: I can't move
 Ryanqazwsx: how do you make him move
 AntiSquid: pour cent, prozent ... so many variants
 Astrobytes: Output a target destination
 therealbeef: output where you want him to move
 airzocker: yes, and he shoots automatically
 Ryanqazwsx: oh ok I will try that 
 Astrobytes: x y coordinate
 therealbeef: 0 0 is top left, 16000 9000 bottom right
 Astrobytes: ^
 airzocker: for example if you output "8000 4500" he will walk to the center at 1000 units per move and shoot zombies that are in a radius of 2000 units
 airzocker: of him
 Ryanqazwsx: oh I did it! thank you so much
 therealbeef: it literally says all these things in the description of the game, by the way&#160;:-)
 therealbeef: (before Astrobytes starts all-capping)
 airzocker: basically every game has a descritption on the left part of the screen that explains how the inputs outputs, the game and everything works, even with some examples ;D
 Ryanqazwsx: lol ok
 airzocker: and it says # Your destination coordinates
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: Honestly I hardly ever do that, but 4+ hours of the same thing over and over...
 Ryanqazwsx: lol
 Astrobytes: How's it going anyway therealbeef? Ready for the contest?
 Ryanqazwsx: I hate doing coordinate stuff
 Astrobytes: Hm, you might wanna get used to that
 struct: was checking vs cvz code
 Astrobytes: A lot (not all) of CG games kinda rely on some basic geometry
 airzocker: yeah, you somehow have to give positions to the game... but there are some ways to simplify things by making helper functions and stuff later if it gets more complicated xD
 struct: is just avx junk code lol
 Astrobytes: your cvz code?
 struct: I sometimes open puzzles and run random code
 struct: to see if it works on cg
 Astrobytes: Random code?
 airzocker: like from random people or code that's not actually for this? xD
 struct: no, code I wrote on VS
 struct: When I was doing avx stuff
 MSmits: just watched the directors cut of justice league
 therealbeef: yes, excited for the contest, Astrobytes. dutch ppl even have a 2-day national holiday in the middle of it&#160;:-D
 MSmits: holy crap 4 hrs...
 MSmits: completely different movie too
 struct: Msmits you were testing the next contest I bet
 MSmits: huh
 Astrobytes: unless you were careful with the includes/definitions then VS code turns out pretty damn awful on gcc  struct :D
 struct: cg asked for beta testers
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: nah, i just now got some time to spare, not before, so i would have saidno
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: excellent! MSmits, you have a 2 day holiday in the middle of the contest
 MSmits: meta mcts been running for 6 hrs with 7 cores and no crashes&#160;:)
 therealbeef: the last weekend is 4 days long
 MSmits: 2 day holiday?
 therealbeef: hemelvaart
 MSmits: actually I am thursday and friday every week till after summer
 Astrobytes: I presume the Friday and Monday, extra long weekend
 MSmits: off i mean
 MSmits: my study stuff was on thursday and friday
 MSmits: and that is mostly done
 MSmits: so that hemelvaart stuff doesnt matter
 therealbeef: ah, so you only have to work 3 days during the 11 day contest
 MSmits: yep
 airzocker: therealbeef i'm german and i actually understood that, because it's himmelfahrt in german xD
 therealbeef: god
 MSmits: in addition to being the next 2 weeks off
 Astrobytes: Have I ever told you that you are a lucky b**tard? If not, you're a lucky b**tard
 MSmits: well now i am, the last 2 months were hell
 Astrobytes: himmelfahrt? Out of heaven?
 MSmits: I got a scholarship for 1 day a week off to study, but my study stuff was concentrated to way more than 1 day a week
 Astrobytes: In to heaven, pardon me
 MSmits: yeah thats when jesus came back i think
 Astrobytes: ausfahrt would be out of
 airzocker: yeah just wanted to say it's to not from xD
 MSmits: if you're into that kind of thing
 MSmits: or when he left
 MSmits: i am not sure
 struct: maybe ill try the avx tomorrow on csb and take a break from the other multi
 MSmits: forgot the logistics of the back and forth 
 therealbeef: himmelfahrt is farting while lying on your belly
 MSmits: from the horses mouth
 MSmits: or the other end
 therealbeef: (sorry, running joke my wife and me have since visiting germany last year)
 airzocker: i would most likely translate himmelfahrt with ascending to heaven xD
 MSmits: yeah thats it airzocker
 airzocker: therealbeef i actually laughed xD
 MSmits: same
 Astrobytes: I did have fun in Sweden seeing Utfart
 MSmits: what kind of fart is that?
 therealbeef: nowadays we crack up when seeing ausfahrt, durchfahrt etc
 therealbeef: rundfahrt
 MSmits: eh ausfahrt sounds like when someone dies
 MSmits: or is buried or something
 Astrobytes: all the fart/fahrt ones get me every time
 MSmits: bad timing to crack up :P
 Astrobytes: Utfart in Swedish is the exit
 MSmits: ah I see
 Astrobytes: You also have (in shops), and this one made me crack up, "Slut Spurt!"
 Youssefk: hey world
 MSmits: what does that mean Astrobytes
 Youssefk: is there a clash here?
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Stop sale
 MSmits: ahh ok
 therealbeef: clash of fahrts
 MSmits: btw I have 7 cores running games, probably with a slight delay in between, but my task manager says 46% processor use
 MSmits: 7 out of 10 cores
 Smelty: wow.
 MSmits: does that make sense?
 Astrobytes: It's like the end sale in a shop
 Smelty: interesting
 therealbeef: hyperthreading?
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: :rofl:
 MSmits: not sure, do you think thats it?
 airzocker: nah
 Astrobytes: Youssefk: Just join a clash
 airzocker: is it always just 46% or fluctuating?
 MSmits: each process uses 6,6&#160;%
 MSmits: pretty constant
 MSmits: but it's a 10 core processor
 MSmits: so should be 10%
 airzocker: and you don't have 16 cores or something like that for sure? xD
 MSmits: mmh, let me check that to be sure
 MSmits: it says 10 cores, 20 logic processors or whatever that translates to
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=threads+vs+processes">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=threads+vs+processes</a>
 airzocker: in linux you can use top if they are separate processes and see the percent in percent of one core...
 airzocker: *from
 MSmits: would a process not completely use a core when left to its own devices and using full computation?
 Astrobytes: Not hard to check in windoze either
 airzocker: left to it's own devices?
 MSmits: yeah without being interrupted
 MSmits: and without input output situation
 MSmits: just pure calculation
 therealbeef: other processes could take 'part' of a core
 airzocker: if the process actually always has to compute something (and not sleep etc at all) it uses one virtual thread, which can be the power of up to one core
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: it sleeps sometimes, a very short time
 airzocker: (if it's not programmed multithreaded)
 MSmits: no multithreads here
 MSmits: just a C# program creating processes
 MSmits: (basically running c++ binaries)
 airzocker: is it your own program or what kind of things does it do?
 airzocker: if it uses internet it maybe sleeps when waiting for packages etc...
 MSmits: oh, it is a meta mcts program. Maintains a tree with nodes that are gamestates and from the leafs it runs simulations
 MSmits: each simulation is a process
 MSmits: and i do max 7 at a time currently
 Astrobytes: A process can have multiple threads
 therealbeef: maybe the process load/startup overhead?
 airzocker: yeah, but he said it's not multithreaded
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but what he needs is multithreading
 MSmits: well i meant it's not using the built in multithreading system C# has
 therealbeef: how often do those processes spawn?
 MSmits: just one time at the start
 MSmits: they stay up
 Astrobytes: Once
 MSmits: when a new sim starts a process is given input
 MSmits: runs for around 2 seconds
 MSmits: then gives output which raises an event
 airzocker: and the gamestates it will simulate with are stored locally?
 MSmits: for the main program
 MSmits: the tree is maintained on HD
 therealbeef: given input via pipes?
 MSmits: not sure if it is a pipe
 Astrobytes: I'll let Smits fill you in on the 'DB'
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/769d0ff8-4f17-4c6e-ac88-0e05ff13b7d2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/769d0ff8-4f17-4c6e-ac88-0e05ff13b7d2</a>
 MSmits: ignore the string stuff
 airzocker: if all the simulations are created once and stored in ram it should use all computing power, but if not that could have to do something with it...
 MSmits: it might be it averages out the input/output delay somehow?
 MSmits: which slows it down from 10% to 6,6%&#160;?
 Smelty: maybr
 MSmits: well  I am just glad i got it to work at all
 MSmits: parallelization is hard
 airzocker: yeah, depends on the situation but often is ;D
 MSmits: I used to run meta mcts for 5 different games at once, to avoid having to do it
 MSmits: each running 1 process
 MSmits: now i can just focus on uttt for a while
 Astrobytes: I think this setup can be improved
 MSmits: probably
 MSmits: i;ve been told i can also use DLLs
 MSmits: instead of processes started from c++ binaries
 Astrobytes: I wonder who told you that
 MSmits: recurse
 Astrobytes: You have a short memory
 MSmits: you also told me?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: thats funny
 MSmits: recurse also did, a very long time ago
 Astrobytes: Ages ago
 MSmits: so i have in fact a long memory
 Astrobytes: FFS
 MSmits: oh you told me a long time ago also?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Astrobytes: When we were talking about you running these multiple binaries
 MSmits: well I will just assume that everything i learned on chat has been told to me by you and possibly someone else
 MSmits: to be safe
 Astrobytes: No, because that would be false
 MSmits: to a degree
 MSmits: might be a lesser degree 
 Astrobytes: Quite false.
 MSmits: ok ok
 MSmits: well I am shitty at keeping records, just keep reminding me then
 Astrobytes: It was the same time we discussed your storage for the meta-MCTS
 MSmits: i discussed that with multiple people too though
 MSmits: includign recurse
 Astrobytes: When you were trying to decide what to use
 MSmits: you're just too nice i think, maybe if you include a snarky comment to tell me i am doing something dumb, i will remember it was you
 Astrobytes: And I said using DLLs rather than starting a whole bunch of exes would be more efficient
 MSmits: ah yeah
 Astrobytes: Right you c**t, this is what you should f**king do - that kinda thing?
 MSmits: mmh, nah more subtle
 Astrobytes: :P
 airzocker: xD
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Why would you do that. That's ridiculous. Seriously.
 struct: Im going to try and CoC MCTS
 Astrobytes: Better?
 MSmits: thats it 
 MSmits: I feel the recurse
 Astrobytes: I miss him.
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: CoC MCTS struct?
 struct: Will he join the contest?
 struct: Im doing mcts for csb with 8 moves each child
 struct: just to test the avx thing
 Astrobytes: It'll be a smurf at first if he does I guess, not sure if anyone's spoken with him recently
 MSmits: struct make sure you test it with a search that you know works
 MSmits: otherwise you're testign two things at once
 struct: What do you mean MSmits?
 MSmits: say you have a non-avx search bot
 MSmits: for csb
 MSmits: put avx into that
 struct: ah yeah
 struct: Its simple Ill just add scalar version
 MSmits: ok
 struct: im just going to do mcts selection with avx
 struct: nothing esle
 struct: else*
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: Remember you can limit the pod count in CSB in the settings
 Astrobytes: Or increase
 Astrobytes: For testing
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: never knew
 Astrobytes: You can have 20 pods if you like
 struct: and it will probably crash&#160;:)
 MSmits: and some can turn them into male mebers
 Astrobytes: Just make sure you can handle it
 MSmits: members
 Astrobytes: Hah
 MSmits: as i recall
 Astrobytes: Amongst other things
 Astrobytes: That was an offline sim though
 MSmits: emh was it?
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 Astrobytes: The dirty bugger
 MSmits: he will forever be remembered as the person who did that
 MSmits: before anything else
 Scarfield:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Totally
 Scarfield: he made pods circle in a certain pattern?
 MSmits: I'll pm you Scarfield
 Astrobytes: It's offline now?
 Ikaro: Alguien de Paraguay?
 Scarfield: im sad that i missed that, would at least have chuckled
 MSmits: yeah it wasn't exactly SFW though :P
 Scarfield: those norwegians
 Astrobytes: Next time we see emh we will force him to show it
 Scarfield: wow
 Astrobytes: If he's not burning churches or something
 Scarfield: he might be to private for that
 Astrobytes: No, he's awesome about it
 Scarfield: "to show it" ahem
 Astrobytes: Show his CSB members, not his!
 Astrobytes: He even referenced some pornstar in chat I'd never heard of
 Scarfield: i know, but as usual i intentionally misunderstood
 Astrobytes: I do the same
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: anyway gn&#160;:) im off
 MSmits: same me too, gn!
 Astrobytes: yeah, gn all
 Tired_Shawty: im nigger
 airzocker: cool
 airzocker: gn xD
 Tired_Shawty: XD
 struct: Automaton2000 clean this mess
 Automaton2000: but it's possible to do something that is more than one
 struct: AutomatonNN is up?
 struct: Automaton2000 you will have to do.
 Automaton2000: it's not like you have to check that
 Roxxx: is anyone playing wondev woman
 Roxxx: once you get 2 units 
 Roxxx: how to differentiate what are legal moves for one and for the other
 struct: let me check
 struct: one sec
 struct: index
 Roxxx: yes i figured that
 Roxxx: but i am making arrays of legal moves
 Roxxx: and i figured if i have 2 units then i would get a max of 16 legal actions
 Marchete: can someone warn dbdr about spam at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=history">https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=history</a>
 Roxxx: but it turns out that's not the case
 struct: max 16 doesnt sound right
 struct: I think someone told him Marchet
 Roxxx: i mean 16 for moves and 16 for builds
 struct: its more
 Roxxx: how can there be more, one unit can only move to 8 spaces
 struct: You can only move in that league?
 struct: or is it move and build?
 Roxxx: move and build, or move and push
 Smelty: o.o
 Roxxx: sry push and build
 struct: unit can move in 8 spaces
 struct: but it can build in 8 directions after it
 struct: 8*8
 Roxxx: ```java
 Roxxx: oh it doesen't work here
 Roxxx: well it's all obtained in the same loop
 Roxxx: one after the other
 Roxxx: all coming from legalActions variable
 Roxxx: so there must be equal amount, otherwise it would overflow
 Smelty: ah
 Roxxx: im not really sure how it is calculating legal builds anywa
 Roxxx: anyway*
 Roxxx: because now that i think of it you are right, there should be 8 possible moves and 56 possible builds
 airzocker: hey, someone know if the warning that i didn't read all input would show up for every move if the problem is in the main loop? can i find out where it's not reading everything? because i didn't really change anything in the input parsing part of the default program...
 struct: airzocker are you sure you dont print multiple times per turn?
 airzocker: i'm doing ghost in the cell, so i mean if the problem is in the initialization input or main loop
 airzocker: i didn't change anything in the output, still just "WAIT" (also using c++)
 airzocker: do you want to see the code?
 struct: Sure
 Smelty: just wondering, is there a pascal's triangle clash yet? I'm ready to submit one...
 airzocker: sorry i'm pretty new here, where can i share again? xD
 struct: paste it here
 airzocker: ehmm what part? xD
 struct: eveything
 airzocker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4b5a7433-b996-435b-9632-b8576c13c5e6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4b5a7433-b996-435b-9632-b8576c13c5e6</a>
 airzocker: ah ok cool xD
 Roxxx: do i maybe need to multiply legal actions by 2 to get input for the second player as well?
 King_Coda: is that a C language airzocker?
 struct: Roxxx I didnt have to change anything, I got all the actions
 airzocker: it says warning with not reading all input once at the beginning of that game info window
 struct: Have you tried reseting the code?
 airzocker: yes c++
 Roxxx: will i lose all of my code then?
 King_Coda: I thought so
 Roxxx: bcs i wrote plenty 
 struct: Save it somewhere
 airzocker: struct what do you mean?
 struct: was talking to roxx atm
 struct: im checking your code 
 airzocker: ok
 King_Coda: I'm currently learning c++, which is why i asked
 airzocker: yeah, i'm also not very expierienced with c++, which is why i'm doing it here, i started with java ;D
 Roxxx: @struct it's still the same after reset
 Roxxx: this is the loop that gives me input

 struct: if you print to stderr the ammount of legal actions
 struct: how many does it say?
 airzocker: at least i got some advice from my dad for this xD
 Roxxx: 55
 struct: So I think it  should be giving all the actions
 Roxxx: now i'm completely confused
 Roxxx: yeah but that's just for one unit
 Roxxx: i have 2 units
 struct: just print to stderr, the atype index
 struct: no, its for both
 struct: Check the index, it changes between 0 and 1
 struct: airzocker Im not sure what causes it
 Roxxx: yeah and i tried storing the output into String arrays based on  index and the second array didn't get filled
 struct: Sometimes this warning is wrong though
 struct: So it might be the case
 struct: Well the 1st unit might have more actions than the 2nd
 struct: its 55 splited by both
 struct: unit 1 might have 30 and 2nd 25
 airzocker: ok thanks, i'll hopefully see if it works anyways when i implement the first output tomorrow ;D
 struct: gl
 Roxxx: are you on discord struct?
 airzocker: gn y'all

 UnnamedCodinGamer: found the bug it was mod with doubles

 struct: gn everyone
 King_Coda: gn
 King_Coda: mmm, i love it when chat dies for 30 minutes
 King_Coda: 32 to be precise

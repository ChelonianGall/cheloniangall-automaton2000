 stalynPunk: hi
 aangairbender: hello
 aangairbender: but you have reading of elevator_floor and elevator_position
 aangairbender: you could store that and use
 SolForecast: I can't seem to call it. It only gives out error that it simply doesnt exist
 aangairbender: i would create an array outside that for loop and append pairs of elevator_floor and elevator_pos to that arrat
 aangairbender: and then use it in my game cycle
 aangairbender: game loop*
 SolForecast: @-@
 aangairbender: because everything creating inside for disappears outside for loop
 aangairbender: it is called variable scope
 SolForecast: I honestly have no idea how python array works yet honestly-
 aangairbender: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0812619-d59c-4af8-a15d-24b59fdd27ec">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0812619-d59c-4af8-a15d-24b59fdd27ec</a>
 aangairbender: btw that can be googled
 aangairbender: i am not good with python, but basic idea to store that elevator data to some global variable
 SolForecast: waitSo array is just, a queue or something?
 aangairbender: yep
 aangairbender: kinda list
 SolForecast: fair enough. I'll give that a try
 aangairbender: good luck
 MadKnight: hihi
 AntiSquid: hello 
 MadKnight: say hello Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how could i make a new state
 AntiSquid: say hello MadKnight
 MadKnight: i did already AntiSquid cmon just scroll up
 AntiSquid: just joking MadKnight, how are you? 
 AntiSquid: i saw russia is clearing up supermarket shelves too
 MadKnight: not that much
 Crypticsy: hey! @MadKnight
 MadKnight: hihihi Crypticsy
 Crypticsy: what's up?
 Crypticsy: how are you doing?
 MadKnight: nice nice
 MadKnight: there is a contest going, Crypticsy
 MadKnight: don't u play it&#160;?
 Crypticsy: hmm i have assignments&#160;:( but i was trying to solve this one medium level puzzle
 Crypticsy: spamming the play all testcases button for 5 mins now
 Crypticsy: it won't let me, says someone is already using the tester 
 Emir56: compiler on c++ not working am I the only one?
 Crypticsy: me too
 IceLake: me too
 MadKnight: lol
 Emir56: the hell is happening
 Crypticsy: yeah what's happening?
 IceLake: loading forever...
 Emir56: clash of code needs seperate categories for every lang
 Emir56: hate being beaten by python on every shortest challenge
 Crypticsy: finally working wow
 emh: high load on servers? submissions seem very slow
 emh: in OOC
 AntiSquid: someone spamming submits 100% 
 AntiSquid: or IDE games
 AntiSquid: my code stil lworks fine in the IDE, i didn't touch it in a while
 dbdr: yes emh. I reported it on discord to @Staff
 Crypticsy: @illedan are you online, can i ask you a question?
 AntiSquid: that is a question!
 jrke: corona 21 days lockdown in india
 Scarfield: that was actually 2 questions already, be careful, only one left 
 Crypticsy: XD hahahaha
 Crypticsy: my bad
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i can't imagine this lockdown going on for too long, it's just not feasible jrke
 AntiSquid: especially in india
 AntiSquid: it won't work
 emh: dbdr ok
 Crypticsy: idk how nepal has only 3 cases so far
 Crypticsy: i am still so skeptical about the government 
 AntiSquid: not many people go there, not many people got tested, tests take a long time
 jrke: i am bored in just 1 day
 AntiSquid: do ocean of code 
 Illedan: What is the question?
 AntiSquid: he asked 2 questions, the daily limit is 1, he needs to come back on Friday
 jrke: is corona in harvard
 Crypticsy: time moves quick in quarantine 
 AntiSquid: i think Illedan is on annual leave on Friday, come back Monday Crypticsy
 Crypticsy: i seriously don't understand the logic behind coming on monday but sure
 AntiSquid: Crypticsy seriously just ask your question @_@
 Crypticsy: i did on private
 emh: 87k now but not improving much
 emh: 2700 lines
 Illedan: that much code?
 emh: yes
 Illedan: wow
 emh: just adding more and more special cases hehe
 emh: and some generic stuff
 emh: I finally replaced bool[width, height] with BitArrays
 blasterpoard: that sounds like you'll have to restart from scratch in silver
 emh: and actually just now I made the assumption that submarine can cross a SILENCE move, so that there is less combinatorial growth to check for
 emh: blasterpoard yes probably
 blasterpoard: im at 700 lines, only 100 of that being the actual bot logic
 AntiSquid: do i need a particular JDK to run CG stuff locally?
 wlesavo: emh wow impressing, do you have much code for local debug?
 AntiSquid: are we flexing the character count?
 kovi: char count * ranking
 AntiSquid: so i need to comment in a wiki article and crash submit bot for maximum point count? :thinking:
 wlesavo: is Automaton2000 called that due to its code length? :thinking:
 Automaton2000: if u get a new button in the ide
 muy31: good morning!
 yfprojects: Good afternoon!
 T-Rone: good night! haha
 anid: If I make my repositories on github private, can others see them?
 bombohead: this is fame not clout
 bombohead: idek what thats about what your mouth
 anid: There is no clear explanation on github for this doubt
 tonowak: anid unless they are invited, nobody (not from github) can see it
 DianaRaie: good night 
 DianaRaie: good afternoon :wink:
 anid: thanks tonowak
 kingofnumbers: why sometimes in leaderboard I can see "last battles" of remaining players and sometimes not? 
 anid: Lol lucky win
 anid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442257627">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442257627</a>

 Uljahn: kingofnumbers: last battles are in full leaderboard <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard</a>
 kingofnumbers: yes, in this exact link 
 kingofnumbers: sometimes it shows me last battles links of players 
 kingofnumbers: sometimes not 
 kingofnumbers: now it doesn't show 
 Uljahn: it may be affected by your browser's width and page scale
 Uljahn: ye, it's width
 kingofnumbers: true 
 kingofnumbers: thanks for help 
 cookiejar: hi
 cookiejar: how can i test my code in power of thor?
 MadKnight: just hit Play
 cookiejar: it doesn't pop up
 MadKnight: and what happens?
 MadKnight: show screenshot
 cookiejar: its empty with no thor xD
 MadKnight: just show screenshot
 yfprojects: You can upload it here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/upload?beta">https://imgur.com/upload?beta</a>
 yfprojects: cookiejar
 MadKnight: u can screenshot a part of screen with win+shift+s
 MadKnight: on win10
 MadKnight: hey yfprojects how's your ocean of code&#160;?
 cookiejar: how do i paste it here 
 MadKnight: just a link
 MadKnight: paste it on imgur, it will generate u a link
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/upload?beta">https://imgur.com/upload?beta</a>
 cookiejar: can u just tell me ho to test my code , its the only problem i have
 cookiejar: there is no test buton
 yfprojects: Blue
 MadKnight: is there Play button&#160;?
 yfprojects: bottom, right of the screen
 cookiejar: play all testcases and submit
 MadKnight: we don't know why it is not there, we need to see screenshot to tell
 yfprojects: Yes: The play testcases one! cookiejar
 cookiejar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/5En8t6d">https://imgur.com/5En8t6d</a>
 MadKnight: no, we need all below this
 yfprojects: The play testcases button, cookiejar

 MadKnight: u need to click one of testcaes
 MadKnight: just click it
 MadKnight: click "Straight line"
 yfprojects: To OceanOFCode MadKnight:Its in progress i would say. I have written down how I want to do it and I am currently refreshing my java knowledge.
 MadKnight: yfprojects why are u not switching over to C#&#160;?
 yfprojects: Because I ont know how to code C#
 yfprojects: :grimacing:
 MadKnight: but c# is just like java
 MadKnight: but with cool features
 MadKnight: u sure do know how to code c#
 yfprojects: I will look into it!
 PJA: how do u calculate the time your bot takes every turn?
 yfprojects: time after output minus time after input
 PJA: ok
 PJA: ty
 PJA: and why do people print it with MSG&#160;?
 cookiejar: i can't belive i did it :o
 yfprojects: :clap:
 yfprojects: MadKnight: So c# is faster then java? Or what are the advantages? Nd how fast is c# compared to c++?
 cookiejar: i thiught c# is allmost java O.o
 cookiejar: thought*
 MadKnight: —Å++ is still faster but c# is faster than java
 MadKnight: yfprojects also c# has some cool features
 DianaRaie: I did it 
 yfprojects: what? MadKnight
 MadKnight: cool features

 Philbot: which java should i install&#160;? 
 MadKnight: c#
 Philbot: jdk&#160;? se&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: openjdk
 Philbot: what version
 MadKnight: what are u gonna use it for&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: latest
 MadKnight: for CG&#160;?
 Philbot: i need it to run some browser apps
 Philbot: and for cg too 
 MadKnight: so as a web-server&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: java applets?
 Philbot: i use windows, not linux
 Philbot: yes that stuff i think
 eulerscheZahl: servers or applets?applets are dead. if your browser still supports them, get a new browser
 blasterpoard: I finally found a way to prune the opponent's paths in OoC...
 blasterpoard: it sounds incredibly stupid, but it works and I can track silence-only bots in &lt;5 ms
 blasterpoard: without sonar
 Illedan: Nice
 Illedan: Keep it secret&#160;;)
 Illedan: Anyone got a seed with very few islands?
 blasterpoard: struct posted seed=-430391657
 ZarthaxX: that 4978131516406146000?
 ZarthaxX: -452707936478065980
 ZarthaxX: less than that?
 Illedan: -430391657 is good
 Illedan: ty
 ZarthaxX: ok
 ZarthaxX: lol Illedan <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442241168">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442241168</a>
 ZarthaxX: what a gam
 ZarthaxX: e
 PJA: silence just add to much possible paths
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442288044">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442288044</a> this one is better
 blasterpoard: my time per turn goes up to 25ms on that seed ^^
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I needed it for my Unit tests as I don't want to bother with crashing into random islands :P
 blasterpoard: even turning on sonar doesn't help on that seed
 yfprojects: @blasterpoard Illedan Are that modified bots that don't shoot? Or is that your strategy?
 LoganStewart016: coders stike back is hard
 blasterpoard: yfprojects that's just testing my bot's enemy tracking
 blasterpoard: it used to crash when there were too many possibilities
 kingofnumbers: blasterpoard, what do you use to measure the running time of your code&#160;? 
 kingofnumbers: I tried to google some methods
 kingofnumbers: but they were inaccurate for 50 ms 
 eulerscheZahl: chrono
 blasterpoard: kingofnumbers <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/osariruxem.cpp">https://hastebin.com/osariruxem.cpp</a>
 kingofnumbers: I tried this 
 kingofnumbers: but it looks like not accurate really 
 kingofnumbers: sometimes it gives me more than 50ms 
 eulerscheZahl: when do you start the timer? before or after reading the input?
 blasterpoard: start timing after reading 1st input
 kingofnumbers: without getting timeout 
 kingofnumbers: before reading 
 kingofnumbers: in first line of while loop 
 eulerscheZahl: you are measuring the time for the referee and opponent too that way
 kingofnumbers: oh yes, true! 
 kingofnumbers: but even if I do that 
 eulerscheZahl: almost everyone of us failed here before&#160;;)
 kingofnumbers: I think the timer will still count the time where my program was idle 
 kingofnumbers: right&#160;? 
 kingofnumbers: I mean because of operating system thing 
 kingofnumbers: which distribute the processor on multiple processes 
 eulerscheZahl: that core is all yours during your turn
 kingofnumbers: cool 
 kingofnumbers: then it should work 
 kingofnumbers: I'll try 
 eulerscheZahl: it's as close as you can get
 kingofnumbers: so much is the error of this method? 
 kingofnumbers: less than 1 ms&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: i recommend not to use the full 50ms, i usually go for 40-45ms
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't check after every simulation step
 eulerscheZahl: as too frequent time checks are expensive too
 kingofnumbers: ok, thanks 
 jrke: 438,879 people affected by corona
 jrke: :slight_frown:
 eulerscheZahl: you mean infected? it affects all of us in some way
 phaberthur: lol im so bad at ocean of code
 dbdr: will there be more games per submit later? gold+?
 dbdr: is mirror planned?
 eulerscheZahl: there are always more game for higher leagues
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know anything about mirror matches
 eulerscheZahl: there is a small difference by who gets to move first
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if big enough for CG to do mirrors
 dbdr: yeah, not sure yet if it's super important
 dbdr: but 1-0 wins are common
 dbdr: so it might be
 phaberthur: can anyone share there code for ocean of codes im not good coder
 eulerscheZahl: then start the discussion on another platform (discord/forum)
 dbdr: right now it's 10+80 matches per submit
 eulerscheZahl: it's a contest, i highly discourage anyone from sharing code
 dbdr: I think it doubles at some point
 phaberthur: lol ok
 dbdr: even forbidden
 dbdr: it's a hard contest for beginners
 dbdr: even wood 2 boss is hard. ah, I don't know about now
 phaberthur: this is my first time coding i dont know anything to be honest
 eulerscheZahl: will probably be replaced again, still too strong
 eulerscheZahl: then the contest might not be the best place to start, try some puzzles in the practice section
 dbdr: it's not bad like this, slowly nerfing
 dbdr: bronze with 1k players can be hell
 phaberthur: i dont understand the puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: yesi guess new wood bosses on silver opening, i don't know for sure either
 dbdr: contest is harder than the puzzles
 phaberthur: i need more begginner material
 eulerscheZahl: then CG might even be the wrong platform, they expect some basic knowledge
 phaberthur: aww i like this website but i guess ill just have to come back to it someday once ive learned how to code :disappointed:
 dbdr: same code finished #9 first (bad-ish start) then #2
 dbdr: so yes, more matches will be needed&#160;:)
 phaberthur: nice
 phaberthur: my  code is long and just lots of console.log moving directions
 phaberthur: but, if im correct, shouldnt there be a way to code in for the torpedo to avoid the islands and its trail without having to tell it exact directions?
 AntiSquid: you could still do CG if you manage to learn on the go
 dbdr: you just tell what point to reach. the torpedo finds the best way, if it's possible
 yfprojects: Do you mean torpedo or submarine?
 phaberthur: submarine
 yfprojects: You have to write your own pathfinding algorithm
 phaberthur: lol i just used the pre wrote algorithm and added some move directions thats probably why i cant win
 Swagboy: phaberthur Few people win in a contest!
 phaberthur: lol i know
 phaberthur: bye everyone, im going to go and find a better coding website for teaching
 phaberthur: have a nice day
 Swagboy: Enjoy phaberthur!
 jrke: can you tell me which is the best language  to learn
 jrke: :thinking:
 pmor: languages have the +'s and -'s.  If you're starting out, I would suggest python, c# or java.
 Albeast: I would advertise python as it is quite generic
 ToshiTuringMachine: java is easy but useless
 pmor: and the language wars begin.....
 ToshiTuringMachine: if you want to win contests, do c++
 jrke: i am leaning c++ is it worth learning it
 pmor: c++ is more difficult. With that complexity comes speed which is why it's used a lot in competitions.
 Uljahn: languages are just tools, it's wise to use appropriate tools for the job
 pmor: ^
 AntiSquid: ^
 Zenoscave: v
 Zenoscave: v
 Zenoscave: &gt; 
 Zenoscave: &lt;
 Zenoscave: a 
 Zenoscave: b
 Zenoscave: a
 Zenoscave: b
 Uljahn: iddqd
 AntiSquid: ban
 Zenoscave: sorry no ban pls
 AntiSquid: someone make ZarthaxX mod
 Zenoscave: Oh god we would all be banned
 ZarthaxX: yes , specially you
 Zenoscave: Hiya zarthie
 ZarthaxX: pew pew zeno
 Zenoscave: PEW PEW
 ZarthaxX: going for top?
 Zenoscave: top ten at least
 ZarthaxX: gud gud
 ZarthaxX: keep going
 Zenoscave: you should too
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 ZarthaxX: doing that
 jrke: which is the easiest language
 Uljahn: basic
 Zenoscave: Python has easy syntax. It is a little harder than basic (VB.NET) but is slightly more usuable in industry
 Csipcsirip: basically it is the most basic language
 Zenoscave: ^
 pmor: MS is sunlighting it though
 Zenoscave: sunlighting?
 pmor: not making future updates
 Zenoscave: ah
 pmor: I used the wrong word...meant sunsetting
 AntiSquid: i would say python is def the easiest
 Tunga: Hey
 Astrobytes: 'def', I see what you did there
 Tunga: Global rating is about compete tab and level is about practice? 
 Uljahn: ye
 Uljahn: you also get XP in compete for promotions in leagues
 Uljahn: i mean in ai bot programming
 Tunga: Got it, thanks
 Glenn: I mean there is literally a leaderboard in this case showing 4 different langauges in the top 10 so...
 yfprojects: ^ Yes, its about the bot, not about the language
 Glenn: I wonder if anyone could even write code in which the difference in execution speed would manifest as a ranking difference. I very highly doubt anyone can optimize to that level in 30 days when it's hard enough to do that in benchmark tests.
 Glenn: This whole X is faster than Y thing is silly.
 daffie: most of the people here aren't real people they're all bots
 Glenn: I mean I'm a bot too so...
 Tunga: You roll an existence question here daffie
 pmor: If you know what you're doing and how to profile, it's not hard.
 Glenn: If it's not hard, why aren't you in the top 10?&#160;:)
 daffie: I just mean do the code clash sometimes and later find out I was playing against bots it says on their profile
 pmor: :P
 Tunga: Glenn, why are you obsessed with rank? 
 daffie: they write their own code and everything
 Tunga: Some bots are better than us in coding? 
 Glenn: Better than me, yeah. lol
 Tunga: I ll rool and cry in my room, alone. Thanks corona btw
 daffie: corona virus is keeping me on edge, can't tell if I have it or don't have it
 Glenn: If you can't tell, you probably don't have it.
 daffie: but I have been super tired, breathing feels heavier but not difficult, I've noticed a small ~99.6 temperature when I take it sometimes other times it's normal
 daffie: I don't wanna be paranoid about it but then I think like would rather take it serious than end up dying because I think I don't have it. I guess I'll find out soon
 yfprojects: i heard that there is a limited amount of Code Clashes, so maybe these bots just have a solution made by a human for every clash
 dbdr: daffie the most important thing you can do is to avoid contact with others as much as possible
 daffie: yea I am I never leave the house and have social anxiety anyway so it is business as usual 
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Tunga: When I started in an international automotive company as a junior and I saw that some codes types codes, it amazes me 
 Tunga: Now it gets worse, some people type some code which is better than me in competitive area 
 Jonpix: How detect islands in ocean of code please? Feel like I'm missing something massive her e
 AntiSquid: x marks the sport
 AntiSquid: spot
 eulerscheZahl: you get the map at the beginning of the game
 Jonpix: Okay got it now :D
 wlesavo: hehe, got to top10
 dbdr: gz wlesavo!
 eulerscheZahl: now all you have to do is to defend that rank for 25 days
 dbdr: ezpz
 wlesavo: yeah, i know that it wont be for long, but still means something to me
 dbdr: s/defend/improve/
 eulerscheZahl: take a screenshot
 wlesavo: i already took screenshoot defeating dbdr :slight_smile:
 dbdr: :D
 Illedan: :diploma:
 Illedan: :diplom:
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 dbdr: honoured that it means somethin to you&#160;:)
 dbdr: :medal:
 wlesavo: Illedan did you downgraded your bot to silence spamer? 
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Testing purposes
 Illedan: But I had to stop and fix referee instead&#160;:(
 wlesavo: thought so, due to that bug?
 Illedan: A few things
 Illedan: and to keep my sanity at bay
 Illedan: So I rewrote everything today and added a whole bunch of unit tests :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: who do bronze people test against
 eulerscheZahl: if he breaks it again, you are allowed to use :wrench:
 eulerscheZahl: other bronze people
 eulerscheZahl: and the default AI
 Illedan: That is if I break it without unit tests :P
 Illedan: xD
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi
 Illedan: hi
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 dbdr: the bronze boss: mchl12
 emh: can't believe how many bugs my code has
 wlesavo: mchl12 have some interesting bug typing SURFACE | SURFACE | SURFACE | SURFACE | SURFACE | at first turn eventually
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it's on purpose to find some map easier?
 wlesavo: or is it even a bug
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl in cost of a timeout?
 dbdr: what, he prints several SURFACE, or...?
 mchl12: yeah, I may have some bugs with surfacing
 wlesavo: yeah, this is a single output
 mchl12: They should be fixed though
 BenjaminUrquhart: doesn't seem to stop you mchl12&#160;:)
 wlesavo: so that a few times runing the code in ide
 dbdr: SURFACE is level += 1, so several can send you flying in the sky
 mchl12: not in my submission of course
 BenjaminUrquhart: wlesavo nice timeout<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442325536">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442325536</a>
 wlesavo: hm, thx
 BenjaminUrquhart: aaand I found another tracking bug brb
 wlesavo: BenjaminUrquhart oh, this probably was in previous submit, fixed that already
 BenjaminUrquhart: what's the longest game so far
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: that replay has a score but no rank for wlesavo -&gt; not the current arena version
 BenjaminUrquhart: "obsolete" I see
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/rmptme">https://prnt.sc/rmptme</a>the arena version has a number there
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl thx, nice to know
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, is you replay reproduce tool still online?
 wlesavo: i just recognized this bug, not sending sector id at surfacing while selftracking, fixed that just before the last submit 
 BenjaminUrquhart: another selftracker, nice
 wlesavo: well it kindof effective
 eulerscheZahl: sure dbdr
 dbdr: found it
 eulerscheZahl: me too :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/442325536">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/442325536</a>
 dbdr: just needs the replay id or it says not found
 eulerscheZahl: true, i should change that one day :D
 dbdr: unrelated: are you making assumptions in your tracking?
 eulerscheZahl: also it loads for several seconds sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Illedan: Why make assumptions?
 eulerscheZahl: assumption: the code finishes in 50ms
 Illedan: Better add probability
 dbdr: I think that's heroku being slow on startup
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: my herokuapp is shut down after 30min of inactivity
 eulerscheZahl: a django project btw
 eulerscheZahl: tried at pythonanywhere before
 eulerscheZahl: but the free version only has a whitelist web servers to request
 eulerscheZahl: codingame not being one of them
 wlesavo: Illedan i think dbdr means prioretize some candidates over the other, for example when opponent jumps prioretize the longest possible dirrection or smth like that
 Illedan: In checking the path?
 Illedan: To prune faster?
 wlesavo: no in decision making
 dbdr: I meant prune "unlikely" options
 dbdr: for whatever criteria
 YannT: Illedan: think  I found an exploit
 YannT: gonna send you replay in PM
 Illedan:&#160;:+1:
 YannT: :grin:
 kingofnumbers: please tell me the exploit
 kingofnumbers: you make me very curious now 
 kingofnumbers:&#160;:( 
 Illedan: Spamming mines are imba
 kingofnumbers: just kidding :D 
 Illedan: They also cause too much pollution
 struct: so, not really an exploit?
 AntiSquid: more pollution than silence?
 AntiSquid: torpedos killing mines was a good counter 
 struct: maybe
 struct: hard to tell without actually testing
 struct: It could also make mines useless
 kingofnumbers: not really, you can't always shoot torpedos 
 kingofnumbers: as this reveals your position
 struct: yes but with 1 torpedo you could destroy at best case 9 mines
 kingofnumbers: but you would probably don't want to walk in all these 9 
 kingofnumbers: maybe you are only interested in walking in only 3 cells 
 AntiSquid: if the opponent place 9 mines next to each other they shouldn't expect an easy win, don't put all eggs in one basket :D
 kingofnumbers: if you are walking in striaght line 
 mchl12: kingofnumbers, you also cannot always trigger mines, this also reveals yourup position
 kingofnumbers: even though I don't see how can triggering mines help revealing position 
 kingofnumbers: but still it doesn't contradict what I was saying 
 struct: it helps by checking previous paths
 kingofnumbers: if only you know the id of the mine that was trigger I would agree 
 kingofnumbers: but you don't know which mine was triggered
 struct: you know the x and y
 kingofnumbers: if I know my opponent throw mines at turns 50 100 and 150 
 kingofnumbers: and then I know trigger (4,5) 
 kingofnumbers: I can't know he was in (4,5) at turn 50 or 100 or 150
 Scarfield: you have his path directions
 kingofnumbers: but if the opponent throw only 1 mine then trigger it 
 kingofnumbers: then I agree 
 mchl12: correct, but you can exclude all the paths that never pass (4,5) on turns 50 100 or 150
 kingofnumbers: it reveals position
 struct: It helps
 AntiSquid: if the opponent input command was MINE N instead of just MINE how much would that change?
 struct: If you save all possible paths, states
 kingofnumbers: mchl12 and what if my opponent was spamming mines (which seems it will be the meta of the game ) 
 mchl12: Then it is still possible to deduce some information
 struct: ^
 Illedan: Make sure you gain more information than they gain&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but i do a full reset of all paths on surface
 eulerscheZahl: that way i lose the mine history
 struct: what about states?
 mchl12: Well, just don't do a full reset&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: my state: tired, getting ready for bed
 phaberthur: :sleeping:
 pb4: You guys change your actions if they'll reveal your position to the opponent&#160;?
 mchl12: Yes, all of them
 AntiSquid: nice 2 point lead
 phaberthur: lol yall so smart
 pb4: Seems hard to implement&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: ofc phaberthur, thanks for noticing
 phaberthur: anytime
 phaberthur: lol
 mchl12: My wr vs egaetan isn't even that high, I think I just perform better versus the other high-ranked players.
 phaberthur: my code consists of whatever the original code is
 mchl12: I have like &lt;50% vs egaetan I thhink
 AntiSquid: RPS
 phaberthur: how to make my submarine go to location on grid?
 AntiSquid: MOVE and then N S W E
 phaberthur: what about coordinates?
 AntiSquid: it's one cell at a time
 phaberthur: oof
 AntiSquid: so to move up: MOVE N
 phaberthur: yeah but so many different maps how do i know what to do
 kingofnumbers: phaberthur, what language do you use? 
 phaberthur: javascript
 phaberthur: its what i want to learn
 kingofnumbers: do you know dfs, bfs? 
 AntiSquid: phaberthur watch some streams regarding this contest, i am sure it will help you:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/472807181163429890">https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/472807181163429890</a>
 AntiSquid: not sure if any of the streamers got out of wood2 yet though
 phaberthur: tbh idk any i just want to learn javascript so its what i use
 kingofnumbers: phaberthur, this contest is not a good choice to learn programming languages 
 phaberthur: lol
 AntiSquid: only learn javascript&#160;?
 AntiSquid: what do you want to use it for?
 phaberthur: bro i dont even know javascript
 AntiSquid: kingofnumbers but that's what i did
 AntiSquid: python first used in contest, same with java, same with c++ :p
 phaberthur: what is the easiest
 AntiSquid: how else do you learn unless you're forced to?
 AntiSquid: python imo phaberthur
 phaberthur: ok
 phaberthur: i think i like java better though and it is most common used 
 phaberthur: javascript i mean
 AntiSquid: depends on the website
 AntiSquid: do you want to create websites btw? what's your motivation to learn javascript&#160;?
 phaberthur: idk i just think it makes most sence
 AntiSquid: try out freecodecamp.com 
 AntiSquid: its main focus is javascript
 phaberthur: is the initial coding good or should i change everything?
 AntiSquid: that's like an existential question
 mchl12: If you mean the provided code for contests, it works for getting the input. You probably still need to save most of it into variables though.
 phaberthur: ok
 phaberthur: i think im gonna take a break from competing and just practice lol
 struct: its a better choice if you are just starting
 phaberthur: lol second day to code
 AntiSquid: no, that's the wrong attitude, better man up and get 1st place in the contest! ask AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the problem with the same score as the opponent on the left of t
 phaberthur: even easy is confusing
 AntiSquid: a lot of tracking to do, yes
 phaberthur: coding is hard to learn
 phaberthur: :sad:
 phaberthur: :cry:
 AntiSquid: tough life
 phaberthur: lol
 phaberthur: i found out why we havent landed on mars yet LOL
 icecream17: hmmm... i wonder what happens in a tie. a tie would be amazing.
 phaberthur: lol
 icecream17: After 3 days im finally 28th in wood2!
 phaberthur: im 342 in wood 2
 icecream17: oh what's happenning?
 phaberthur: idk how to code at all
 icecream17: did you know you can delete the boss to battle other players?
 phaberthur: lol no, it wouldnt matter like i said i cant code so i would still lose
 phaberthur: i cant even land on mars and this is an easy level
 phaberthur: finally i did it yay
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Quidome: How is the silence part working especially the meaning of: (not visiting already visited cells or islands)
 Scarfield: you cannot end on or go over a cells previously visited, without surfacing first
 Aviolezt: lol
 Quidome: aha, so normal movement rules, only faster&#160;:)
 Scarfield: yup&#160;:)
 icecream17: i'm on wood2, but from what i've heard silence is like secret teleportation
 phaberthur: ive never even heard of silence
 icecream17: silence is for when you beat wood2. and my comment was too late and looks out of order
 phaberthur: ok
 icecream17: you can travel up to 4 blocks or something in 1 turn and your opponent doesn't wknow where
 Quidome: sonar doesnt look that usefull at first sight...
 AntiSquid: silence = skip wood1
 icecream17: oh yeah, phaberthur, in the first few minutes you could use the starting code and beat wood2. lucky
 phaberthur: cool
 Uljahn: bosses were broken then
 egaetan: mchl12
 egaetan: yes you are under 50% <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/ocean-of-code/mchl12">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/ocean-of-code/mchl12</a>
 egaetan: but i'm under 50% vs you too
 egaetan: one of us should resubmit
 AntiSquid: might be 10% draws
 egaetan: limit of games we can retrieve through leaderboard
 egaetan: i've got 23 games/ mchl12 only 11
 muy31: when opponent uses sonar do they get where I am on the turn I learn they use sonar or the turn right before
 mchl12: The result of sonar is determined on the moment you use it
 muy31: i am not the one using sonar
 muy31: my opponent is
 tonowak: yes
 muy31: what does he see?
 tonowak: it works in the same way
 aCat: the state on the moment he used it
 muy31: do i know that he has used sonar the moment he uses sonar, or do i kow the turn after?
 Hup: I'm attempting the temperatures puzzle and I have a question: Do I need to write code that will perform all test cases or do I need to re-write per test case?
 Hup: Hello
 muy31: don't bruteforce
 muy31: write one that will work no matter the testcase
 muy31: *hard code i meant
 mchl12: Someone uses sonar on a sector, the result is determined the moment they use it. It becomes 'Y' if the opponent is in the sector and 'N' if the opponent is not in the sector. The next turn they will get to see what the result was.
 phaberthur: this is so hard the code is so long
 muy31: So: A) opponent uses SONAR B) I see SONAR in opponentOrders C) opponent gets result?
 muy31: b, not sunglasses
 mchl12: i like the sunglasses
 mchl12: this order is correct
 muy31: so when I see SONAR in opponentOrders, have I yet moved from the position I was when the opponent used SONAR/
 muy31:&#160;?
 tonowak: Someone uses sonar on a sector, the result is determined the moment they use it. It becomes 'Y' if the opponent is in the sector and 'N' if the opponent is not in the sector. The next turn they will get to see what the result was.
 muy31: bruh
 mchl12: No, you haven't moved yet when you see SONAR in opponentOrders.
 muy31: okay thx I think that makes sense
 tonowak: no problem, glad I was helpful
 muy31: ...
 tonowak: :P
 mchl12: tonowak is always so helpful &lt;3
 tonowak: though if you say what you didn't understand in the rule definitions, maybe it would be possible to change it to make it more understandable
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: but i understood it, but i couln'd visualize it
 muy31: at this moment
 muy31: oh yeah what league does POWER come in to play?
 muy31: so far it does nothing
 muy31: nvm
 tonowak: what is POWER?
 tonowak: ok
 muy31: that was dumb
 muy31: charge
 muy31: that is charge
 muy31: they should just call it charge
 tonowak: it isn't called at all
 AntiSquid: didn't bother reading the statement, but i thought that's what they use, "charge"
 muy31: no they use "power"
 tonowak: no they don't
 muy31: MOVE direction POWER
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a31cbafe-c016-4422-bbc1-c769f26232ad">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a31cbafe-c016-4422-bbc1-c769f26232ad</a>
 tonowak: they never named the "charge" thing. They mentioned it *charges* a *power*
 AntiSquid: ah yes
 tonowak: a power is torpedo/sonar
 AntiSquid: so they call it power then :D
 muy31: yeah it was dumb question
 muy31: my bad
 AntiSquid: they could use charge instead 
 muy31: they could
 mchl12: using POWER causes your submarine to take 1 less damage from all sources for 1 turn
 AntiSquid: or they're undecided whether power or charge is best
 tonowak: AntiSquid they don't call it power. Nor charge. They never named it in the description. It charges a power. That's the only thing they say
 muy31: it is both!
 muy31: dun dun dun
 AntiSquid: MOVE direction POWER =&gt; they do call it power -.-
 AntiSquid: it's in the statement
 AntiSquid: they caps it, because it's a keyword
 tonowak: do you write MOVE N POWER or MOVE N TORPEDO?
 tonowak: torpedo is a power
 AntiSquid: it's how the statement is generally formatted, caps = keyword
 AntiSquid: ya i get what you are saying, but for the statement it works like that
 muy31: ... exiting the scene
 muy31: i was never here
 tonowak: everything that is capitalized you hardcode it in the output, but not POWER. That's an exception, that's why it does not mean it is called power
 tonowak: though, I also get what you are saying
 muy31: therefore we agree
 muy31: the end
 tonowak: kind of...
 muy31: sorry for wasting your time
 tonowak: :P
 muy31:&#160;:'
 muy31:&#160;:)
 muy31: how did i screw that up?
 AntiSquid: tonowak i was sure i've seen something similar in another game, could be i have false memories and these guys didn't stick to the usual way of formatting
 Astrobytes: It was also a prototype from some time ago I believe, and was rushed out in 2 days so... bound to be an inconsistency or 2
 AntiSquid: didn't make any improvements for a day, dropped 60 ranks
 AntiSquid: people are getting serious&#160;!
 tonowak: yeah, I dropped from first place to 15h, by doing nothing for three days&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 tonowak: though I'm starting to finally include the mines in my code. I completely ignored them, both from my side and my opponent's side
 mchl12: including mines in my bot put it from 8th to 1st, the impact is pretty big
 tonowak: mchl12 do you try to evade the mines?
 Illedan: Any high ranked players in ooc around?
 ZarthaxX: ask tommorrow
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8396250c21e3f21e3bd77a4e567e27e40c488e">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8396250c21e3f21e3bd77a4e567e27e40c488e</a>I just need someone to submit in Bronze in this version. So that I can track bugs before I release it.
 pb4: Illedan&#160;?
 pb4: What do you need&#160;?
 pb4: submitted in leagues 3 and 4
 AntiSquid: submit can only be in 1 league at a time
 PYB: why the hell are some problems so goddam complicated
 PYB: 15 minutes is not long enough for some of them
 PYB: tired of this shit
 icecream17: 15 minutes?
 Astrobytes: try the contest, you got 25 days :P
 icecream17: 7th place, fixed 2 bugs....
 AntiSquid: and 2500 times the headache
 Astrobytes: :D
 PYB: clash of code is 15
 PYB: some problems are interesting, but demand A LOT of code, hence why 15 minutes isnt in some case
 PYB: just frustrating
 Astrobytes: "Fix it, ezpz" ‚Ñ¢
 PYB:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Sorry. "Fix it" "ezpz", CG memes 
 Astrobytes: ask MadKnight
 YannT: Illedan: submited too
 YannT: all  of the markers on  the replay are ridiculous :o
 struct: What do you mean?
 YannT: new versions has a marker on every action apparently
 YannT: it's unreadable&#160;:(
 YannT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/8fWiPmC.png">https://i.imgur.com/8fWiPmC.png</a>
 icecream17: Wow. I charged for the third time and moved forward.
 icecream17: Then my opponent shot me and moved justt enough so that I couldn't shoot back.
 icecream17: Because of a coincidental wall.
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl are you on?

 icecream17: Wood 2 of ocean of code
 Zenoscave: nice

 icecream17: Huh. I didn't do anything but my place updated to 40/129
 Zenoscave: Wood1 is fairly easy compared to wood 2
 Zenoscave: for some reason
 icecream17: i was in the contest from the start though...
 Zenoscave: Well have you done many contests before?
 icecream17: no
 Zenoscave: many of these players have, so they know the tricks and tips to get high quick
 Zenoscave: is this your first contest?
 icecream17: yes
 Zenoscave: even making it out of wood 2 (and soon wood 1&#160;;) ) is an accomplishment. Challenge against yourself not others. it tends to be more fun that way
 icecream17: ok
 icecream17: so up, down, left, right only? [silence]
 Zenoscave: yes. but up to 4 moves away
 Zenoscave: but all up or all dow, etc.

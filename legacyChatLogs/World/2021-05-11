 Smelty: y-yikes
 JP7: wait
 JP7: I've not edited my spring challenge code all weekend
 JP7: why did I just promote
 JP7: wtf
 JP7: O.o
 Zenoscave: you got bumped by someone else when you were close to boss
 Wontonimo: consider it a public service
 JP7: I mean, I'll take it
 JP7: lol
 Wontonimo: if you submit early in a contest, you don't have to beat the boss, you just have to be better than those that beat the boss
 JP7: ahh, comprendo, ty
 Wontonimo: if boss is rock, you can't beat it if you are scissors, but when paper comes along and beats rock, the system will think you are better than both.
 JP7: Well-put
 Wontonimo: okay, tomorrow is write-a-sim day (maybe)
 UndercoverToad: wasn't that on Saturday?
 Zenoscave: I hate random loss streaks
 Bernard_Lowe: Hi, where can I view the changes for silver league? I got a 404 error on rank up.
 klforthwind: 404 is a page error? there shouldnt be any changes between bronze and silver, but I could be wrong
 Bernard_Lowe: I guess nothing has changed. I looked through the rules.
 Zenoscave: nothing changes after bronze
 Zenoscave: unless there's like an obvious bug in the game
 LLG: should I expect any changes in gold and above tho?
 LLG: or is this gonna be the whole game til the end of the contest
 Zenoscave: no changes
 Zenoscave: Just harder opponents
 LLG: I see
 Bernard_Lowe: Yes, 404 is very common html page error in general.
 Zenoscave: Bernard_Lowe what are you talking about
 Bernard_Lowe: Ok thanks, I was busy all day and haven't had a chance to look at this until now.
 Bernard_Lowe: Zenoscave, I was replying to klforthwind. When I refreshed my page to get the promotion to silver, the html web page gave me a 404 web page error. This has nothing to do with the coding contest or coding pushes if that's what you're thinking.
 UndercoverToad: zeno you wanted to win C#. where are you?&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: Can't break 100
 Zenoscave:&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: once again you are leaving all the work to me
 Zenoscave: Sorry :D
 UndercoverToad: and there's a Perl right below me.
 UndercoverToad: A PERL!
 Zenoscave: If I add opponent sim and make it decently fast I should be top 50
 Zenoscave: my eval allows for it. just haven't made it yet
 NinjaDoggy: opponent sim can be scary D:
 UndercoverToad: not even I have opponent sim
 Zenoscave: Then my eval is awful
 Zenoscave: or slow
 UndercoverToad: or slowful
 Zenoscave: true
 Wontonimo: what's your bot getting up to in rank Zenoscave?  I see it's at 250 and only 1/3rd done
 UndercoverToad: 100
 Zenoscave: ~120
 Zenoscave: This isn't a good submit. I'm testing things
 Wontonimo: 52.03 ish in TS.
 Wontonimo: so, looking around there, from 120 up to 100 there isn't much of a gap in Score.  For 20 position tthe score is only 0.49 points
 UndercoverToad: in these ranks it's always close together
 Zenoscave: the current submit is my current best preforming
 Wontonimo: it doesn't start to spread out again until 32
 Ajaiy2: What's the difference between the rules in bronze and silver?
 Zenoscave: nothing Ajaiy2
 LLG: nothing
 Ajaiy2: Oof
 Bernard_Lowe: I was expecting changes in the map with unusable tiles or richness locations -- for silver or gold.
 Bernard_Lowe: Or different tree start orientations.
 Zenoscave: nothing usually changes after bronze
 Wontonimo: nopes
 Zenoscave: rarely in fact
 Ajaiy2: I guess they ran out of ideas
 Bernard_Lowe: Well there were a ton of changes in pac-man in Spring 2020, so I expected some changes.
 Wontonimo: no, it's the formula to these games
 DetoBot: TestMain.java is throwing IO exception 
 Zenoscave: No. They just decide to keep the rules the same due to community opinion
 DetoBot: how do I solve it
 DetoBot: Trying to run the sim locally
 LLG: I guess I played myself in IDE too much
 Bernard_Lowe: Having some small changes can make it fun without being intrusive, like richness locations or unusable tiles, or tree starts. But I'm fine with either.
 LLG: getting #407s now
 DetoBot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d90e2cf-8e9d-4105-9526-6a1d2b07c337">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d90e2cf-8e9d-4105-9526-6a1d2b07c337</a>
 Bernard_Lowe: The pac-man changes were huge, from bronze to silver, to gold, so I was expecting some climate change, level changes today lol.
 DetoBot: what's the problem in it?
 Wontonimo: yeah LLG, just take a break for 5 min
 DetoBot: ok got it
 Marchete: moin
 Zenoscave: moin
 DetoBot: it working now
 Marchete: wow perl 8th, what's that sorcery?
 Zenoscave: I guess wrapper
 Marchete: he is the winner, period
 Marchete: ahhh
 kovi: not suretop10-20 is still possible with heuristic
 Zenoscave: true. 
 UndercoverToad: any sim merged into your heuristic yet?
 ZarthaxX: wait what kov not searching?
 kovi: beam is ticking...but bad results
 Marchete: I said that heuristic had a chance this game
 Marchete: not like winning
 Marchete: but a fair place
 UndercoverToad: legend is possible
 Zenoscave: just placing?
 jrke: can anyone tell me how good can be depth 1 all moves evaluating bot?
 UndercoverToad: top 20 at the end. I have doubts and would like to be proven wrong
 kovi: yeah, bottom legend like kutulu
 UndercoverToad: jrke that's a depth 1 bot vs my arena: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551825521">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551825521</a>
 UndercoverToad: i guess I heavily rely on depth to get anywhere :D
 UndercoverToad: oh wait I have a mistake
 Zenoscave: eulerstake
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551826119">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551826119</a>
 UndercoverToad: red = depth 1
 UndercoverToad: doesn't stand a chance
 Marchete: but it depends
 Marchete: a NN can be almost perfect at depth1
 Zenoscave: Marchete what are you doing in c#
 Zenoscave: I don't like this
 Marchete: I don't know!
 Marchete: I never used dotnet
 Marchete: I wanted to test it
 Zenoscave: fair enough
 Marchete: seems powerful
 UndercoverToad: did discord change their icon?
 UndercoverToad: i have a feeling that the blue proportion is higher now
 UndercoverToad: in the browser tab bar
 jrke: blue to white and white to blue?
 Ajaiy2: Is anyone gonna do some "spring cleaning" on their code?
 UndercoverToad: no. i just think the blue circle looks thicker
 UndercoverToad: no, it's a contest. I make it even more messy to gain a few more sims in return
 UndercoverToad: that submit looks promising
 Ajaiy2: I get what you mean
 UndercoverToad: found a bug in my seed spot eval
 Marchete: can I disable the unsafe errors in CG IDE?
 Ajaiy2: That'd take a long time to find
 UndercoverToad: i just ignore CG IDE hints
 Marchete: my right bar is a christmas tree
 UndercoverToad: looks like a chrismas tree when the language server doesn't crash
 UndercoverToad: oh, same metaphor :D
 Marchete: :unamused:
 UndercoverToad: i swear i wrote that before seeing yours
 Marchete: that C# mindset is contagious
 Zenoscave: Why so many C#'s
 Zenoscave: where are they comming from?
 Marchete: :christmas_tree:
 Smelty: l o l
 Smelty:&#160;;/
 UndercoverToad: oh, 2nd :heart_eyes:
 Zenoscave: gz
 Marchete: something new? a new hash?
 UndercoverToad: bugfix
 UndercoverToad: my seed placement eval checked the source cell, not the target
 Marchete: .....
 Zenoscave: whoops lol
 UndercoverToad: :D
 Marchete: ok that's embarrasing
 UndercoverToad: so random seed targets can still reach top10
 Wontonimo: what?  that's so random
 Marchete: if a bot with 13.45% hash collision rate, without seed eval, on C# with 20ksim can be 2nd
 Marchete: I don't know
 jrke: which data type or STl do you prefer for beam search
 Zenoscave: heuristics may have a chance?
 Marchete: I'd say yes
 Marchete: chance to be high
 Marchete: not winning maybe
 UndercoverToad: my beam is just putting everything into a hashset to remove duplicates. then use OrderBy().ToList()
 Marchete: hashset with 1% duplicates*
 Zenoscave: Isn't linq horribly slow?
 UndercoverToad: well, the hashset can handle that
 MSmits: performance is not very important in this game
 UndercoverToad: yes, LINQ is slow. but sure how much that applies to sorting
 Zenoscave: hmmmm FAir
 UndercoverToad: i think a higher performance would still help me
 alanhong: hi
 MSmits: you need good eval (which i still havent found&#160;:( )
 UndercoverToad: to overcome flaws in the eval
 Marchete: we are doomed then
 jrke: thats unordered_set in cpp right?
 MSmits: yes it is
 UndercoverToad: yes
 jrke: me too Ms no good eval
 MSmits: i basically do what UndercoverToad does in my bot, excepting the good eval
 MSmits: it's probably 10x faster, but that doesn't matter 
 UndercoverToad: so you also simulate to day 23 to count suns?
 MSmits: yes i do now, i tried a few versions of that
 Marchete: a lot of waits until 23?
 MSmits: sounded good and i still think it does
 UndercoverToad: yes
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: as it's cyclic
 UndercoverToad: in the end you will beat me again. you always do that smits
 Marchete: it's like 6 turns
 UndercoverToad: i do some caching on that not to cast shadows in the same direction twice
 MSmits: UndercoverToad i know and i am always unsure of that, this time is no different. I need a good ides
 MSmits: idea
 kovi: nice UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: but true, some math can simpify it further
 Marchete: that's what I said
 UndercoverToad: thanks kovi
 Marchete: from day N to 23
 Marchete: make a count of days per orientation
 MSmits: I'm not entirely sure what to do with growth in this sun-sim-to-23
 UndercoverToad: you always doubt MSmits. but depending on your overall schedule you might even bypass before Friday
 Marchete: then 6 the shadows * array
 KCrown: how many nodes from day N to 23 approx?
 MSmits: I tried growing everything to size 3
 Kolo9: niiice 2nd UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad:&#160;:)
 MSmits: or not growing at all and just wait
 Kolo9: I started writing a sim and gave up because I realized I don't really know what to do with it. Made a couple changes to simple heuristic today and 102
 UndercoverToad: i print the number of nodes I visit
 Wontonimo: it's not cost effective for overall income to grow everything to 3e
 Kolo9: still have no idea when to remove trees. tried something and it made it worse
 MSmits: Wontonimo i see
 Marchete: number of nodes you visit + going to 23 sounds like MCTS....
 UndercoverToad: that tree removal is still a hacky heuristic for me
 jrke: i still strongly believe completeing before N days is not good
 UndercoverToad: not even checking if the opponent started selling or score difference or anything
 MSmits: i'm not sure you need to check this
 Kolo9: yeah I'm not checking opponent at all, not even simulating anything from next move
 MSmits: either it's optimal to sell or it's not
 Kolo9: tried to update to complete trees that shadow too many of my trees next turn, but that didn't work
 UndercoverToad: did you include shadows cast to opponent?
 Kolo9: well, checking how many of mine vs. opp are shadowed by the tree
 Kolo9: yeah
 Marchete: complete at &lt;23 must take into account shadows
 Kolo9: also I think I'm growing from 2-&gt;3 too much
 Marchete: limit trees per size
 UndercoverToad: my sim counts the suns for me and opponent with and without cutting the tree and compares
 Marchete: it's a solution
 Marchete: I think my shadow calc isn't very expensive
 MSmits: UndercoverToad you mean your beam just considers completion and the completed state is one of the states that you eval 
 Kolo9: I see Toad, thanks. I *think* mine would have been doing the same thing?
 Marchete: eval is (and move gen)
 MSmits: since you eval every state with your sun thingy
 UndercoverToad: yes smits
 Kolo9: oh actually no because it only considered the next-turn shadow from the tree I'm cutting down
 MSmits: yep same thing i do&#160;:)
 Khimich13: hi everyone! do you know if there is a way to keep playing clash after time is up just for training?
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 UndercoverToad: search it
 MSmits: did you force a phasing order? I see a lot of players do complete-grow3-grow2-grow1-seed
 MSmits: i could check a few games\
 MSmits: to figure
 UndercoverToad: no comment
 Wontonimo: ^^ that is a very cost efficient method
 MSmits: hehe
 Marchete: he said it was irrelevant yesterday
 MSmits: I'll check&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: it can save 3 suns or so a turn
 Marchete: and I can't see why
 UndercoverToad: tell me your findings in DM
 jrke: how can i make sorting in unordered set?
 MSmits: will do
 Marchete: you don't
 Marchete: unordered is unordered
 icecream17: gn
 Wontonimo: gn all
 Wontonimo: it's about the half way point for the competition
 Ajaiy2: What do you think I should do to my code? Should I go another path or stay where I am? I'm currently using a algorithm which just checks for a good place to plant
 KCrown: Im using algorithm only and Im at 666 ... I thin kI cna improve that by maybe 200 300 ... but then I think you need to search
 dbdr: nice UndercoverToad
 aangairbender: yesterady my simulation was kinda 6k/100ms, today its 300k/100ms and my beam search manages to search until the end of the game in 100 ms wtf
 aangairbender: has bug for sure
 dbdr: aangairbender with a narrow beam, you can go as deep as you want
 aangairbender: dbdr, yeah I had 500 width and my bot didnt seed and new trees (my eval is just points + suns/3)
 aangairbender: seems like too narrow
 MSmits: jrke in my beamsearch i have both an array and an unordered set
 MSmits: i sort the array, or at least, i use nth element, which is cheaper than sort
 MSmits: max element to pick final move
 MSmits: you dont do everything with just unordered set
 MSmits: unordered set is just to check if you already have a state
 KCrown: by beam do you gusy some form of  monte carlo?
 Marchete: it's just a isDuplicate()
 LLG: how'd you go from 6k sims to 300k sims
 Marchete: adding bugs
 MSmits: 300k seems easily doable
 aangairbender: LLG I rewrited my sim without any invalid moves checks
 MSmits: if a sim is advancing 1 state
 MSmits: maybe not with full sim to end on every move (with suns)
 aangairbender: and assumed 2nd players always goes WAIT
 aangairbender: MSmits but giving suns is a part of the sim, how can I remove it?
 Marchete: he is saying simulate to the end
 aangairbender: my sim is just state+action -&gt; new state
 aangairbender: but if player does WAIT it gives suns
 MSmits: aangairbender i mean every time you sim 1 turn and you eval for beamsearch, you do a full calc to end for suns
 MSmits: so basically youre simming 1 turn
 MSmits: but you check if this action changes the final sujn count
 jrke: why is this happening depth 25 in 66 ms beam width 400
 jrke: :rolling_eyes:
 Marchete: width 400 -&gt; 4000
 aangairbender: MSmits so I can eval only in the end of the day?
 Zenoscave: How are you doing a width of 4000 :O
 aangairbender: or I dont get it :sweat_smile:
 Marchete: no I'm not
 Marchete: I'm saying that if you have 66ms and you reach depth 25
 Marchete: maybe you can increase the width
 Zenoscave: and lower depth a bit?
 Marchete: imo without enemy a depth 25 is noise since depth 4
 aangairbender: that's smart
 jrke: but i think there is bug cause thats large amount of nodes in small time
 Zenoscave: depth 4 due to innacurate next day events of neighbor?
 icecream17: i dont understand... how is this person at 2154th place beating me???
 Marchete: because the enemy won't wait full days
 zukarinkuari2: im making ro b l o x game 
 zukarinkuari2: u w u 
 zukarinkuari2: HAHAHAHAHA
 Marchete: beam search is like a max without min
 zukarinkuari2: print ("hello beach")
 Marchete: but it's working
 zukarinkuari2: imma play clas of code
 zukarinkuari2: bnbabababababayeeee
 Zenoscave: zukarinkuari2 quit
 jrke: the one thing that looks good is i completed all that i seeded- <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551847865">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551847865</a>

 Marchete: movegen seems fine
 jrke: did this line in statement was from starting - 'The theme and game for this challenge are strongly inspired by Hjalmar Hach's excellent board game Photosynthesis.'?
 Marchete: no
 limakk: neighbors keep update automatically or we have to update &gt;

 JoshuaRC02: Does anyone know how to fix the playback for the event only showing grey images?
 UndercoverToad: try disabling and reenabling hardware acceleration
 UndercoverToad: or different browser
 JoshuaRC02: thanks, that fixed it

 UndercoverToad: floating points with an absurd high precision that can cause precision issues.
 UndercoverToad: constraints saying &lt; 24 but a validator having 28
 UndercoverToad: and overall doesn't seem interesting to me. at least do something about next day. like 23h to 1h = delayed
 LLG: what do you guys look for when selecting a cell to plant a new seed?
 The_ZimaBlue: richness
 NinjaDoggy: avoiding shade on each other
 NinjaDoggy: then by richness
 dGrayCoder: how exactly do you guys make "AI" for these games?
 dGrayCoder: Using Algos like Minimax or something else?
 NinjaDoggy: depends on the game
 NinjaDoggy: most people are doing beam search for this game
 limakk: me doing if else&#160;:|
 limakk: (19-36), (7-18), (1-6), (0) to find distance :p
 Thienu: does anyone know how to test locally?
 Thienu: ideally with lots of games
 Zenoscave: damn depth 5 times out now
 Ahriana: how to complete spring challenge&#160;:(( i dont know the rule
 supershah: guys i can't see the game it shows blank screen
 dGrayCoder: If I am not wrong, beam search does not consider your opponents moves?
 supershah: I tried refreshing
 dGrayCoder: @supershah close your browser and try again
 dreadylein: depends, but most people opt to no consider the opponent at the moment
 supershah: okay
 supershah: still the same problem&#160;:(
 RageNugget: is there a way to get back to a clash of code challenge, even after the timer is over? want to fonish that thing&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: try to disable and reenable the hardware acceleration or switch browsers
 supershah: okay let me try that
 supershah: it worked
 UndercoverToad: nice
 supershah: thanks
 NinjaDoggy: the helpful undercover toad :O
 UndercoverToad: being helpful is not my primary goal this contest
 NinjaDoggy: :O he's going for the win :O
 dbdr: a toad wants a new achievement
 NinjaDoggy: do you plan on sticking with beam search? or are there plans for a new algo?
 UndercoverToad: the problem is: i'm usually high early in the contest
 UndercoverToad: but can't keep up the pace at the end
 NinjaDoggy: yep seen this all too many times
 UndercoverToad: i might go away from beam if i find out how to code that properly
 NinjaDoggy: day 5: a sad defeated toad croaks for the last time in chat before going off to bed
 UndercoverToad: you haven't even been around at the worst of my losses
 NinjaDoggy: O.o
 UndercoverToad: mean max, ghost in the cell
 NinjaDoggy: I was there lurking ._.
 UndercoverToad: oh
 NinjaDoggy: ghost in the cell was like my first contest&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: i didn't even know that you are here that long
 UndercoverToad: was my 3rd
 solistice: Good morning guys
 NinjaDoggy: morning&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: i'm about to head to bed :P
 solistice: So, I've never worked with timings. Is it safe to say that I can just use something like stopwatch in c# to break off calculations whenever I'm close to the 100ms limit?
 solistice: or is that risky?
 NinjaDoggy: yea that's how it's generally done
 solistice: so, if I understand correctly, I have 1s to provide first action, then 100ms for all subsequent?
 Marchete: just reset the timer after you read inputs
 UndercoverToad: i use stopwatch too
 NinjaDoggy: that's correct
 Marchete: everybody at C# uses stopwatch
 Marchete: I even did in C++ :D
 solistice: and from where to where should I time? the beginning of the while loop until writing the action?
 UndercoverToad: but not System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew()
 Marchete: then what
 Marchete: oh, it's a secret, shhhh
 ddreams: start timing after the first read
 dbdr: \o/
 Marchete:  /°\
 LLG: I've been getting 407s for the last 15 minutes
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29cef6e3-ae9e-4342-b589-b326e172e3c1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29cef6e3-ae9e-4342-b589-b326e172e3c1</a>
 Marchete: a wrapped stopwatch
 Marchete: microsecond resolution (can be nano, but what for?)
 Marchete: Start(89*1000) then Timeout() to check the timeout
 Marchete: it's simpler for me
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: is there a way to calculate neighbours and shadows with bitboards or am I wasting my time? I'm new to bitboards
 LLG: are you using cube coords or spiral coords?
 Marchete: bitboards is hard
 darkhorse64: and likely useless in the contest
 Marchete: it's a way to calculate shadows, but you need some precalcs
 Marchete: like converting sun orientation to a shift offset
 aCat: how often do you check time?
 Marchete: in my case:  int[] sunOffset = new int[]{ 1,-7,-8,-1,7,8 };
 aCat: because its slow operation by itself
 Marchete: that means bit shift
 Marchete: either left or right according to sign
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: LLG I am redoing my implementation so not sure which to use
 Marchete: bitboard will be fast
 aCat: yeah darkhorse64 probably right&#160;:(
 Marchete: but it's not trivial
 aCat: wasted few days on this but learned a lot
 aCat: Marchete how often do you check time?
 Marchete: then it's not wasted
 aCat: I self this myself :P
 aCat: *tell
 Marchete: aCat you should adjust to avoid timeouts
 Marchete: i.e. as few as possible while not timing out&#160;:)
 Marchete: I'm not at that point yet
 Marchete: I have sun calc bugs
 darkhorse64: If you go the search way, a sim without optims is plenty fast enough. The real issue is the eval
 Marchete: it depends on the eval
 darkhorse64: I have 400k nodes/depth 20 in my BS but it's crap
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok possibly I will skip the bitboards for now then. My current bot is around 140 with heuristics so hopefully the eval works ok with search
 Marchete: because depth 20 BS is crap
 Marchete: yeah NotSureWhyThisWorks, bitboards are hard
 Marchete: for me it's like N days of work
 darkhorse64: depth 10 is no better
 aCat: but satisfying ;p
 Marchete: yeah, bitboards are fun (for geeks, ofc)
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I am used to python so python me wants to just have lists and tuples and all that nice stuff
 darkhorse64: bitboarding in fall challenge was more rewarding
 aCat: more == the only way to go ;p
 aCat: (nearly)
 darkhorse64: The only thing I did was compressing my node up to a point I can use it as a hash key for removing duplicates. That was a huge speed gain
 UndercoverToad: Marchete 10:03AMin my case:  int[] sunOffset = new int[]{ 1,-7,-8,-1,7,8 };
 UndercoverToad: except that we swapped + and -
 itzluku: guy what depth do u achieve and what&#160;% of possible move combinations do u evalutate+your rank: (depth,%,rank)&#160;?
 itzluku: guys*
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: what coordinate system is that sunOffset for?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: axial?
 UndercoverToad: assigning own IDs to the map and ignoring the ones assigned by CG
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: right
 AntiSquid: agree with you darkhorse64
 annaproxy: Just replaced all my bool[] with uints and it's not even faster D: 
 AntiSquid: what about the rest of your code? is that optimized?
 annaproxy: Probably not ^^' 
 dbdr: profile before optimizing
 Thienu: dbdr what's a recommended way to profile?
 AntiSquid: ok found some evals to break into top 1k i hate the game even more now realizing what i needed . pure bs
 jrke: i need a good eval
 AntiSquid: it's only #800 or so but good enough 
 UndercoverToad: you have to code the beam search properly
 AntiSquid: ya who doesn't jrke&#160;? :D  do you use any eval at the moment or minimal&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: still requires some skill
 AntiSquid: i don't use beam search
 jrke: i am messed up
 UndercoverToad: &gt; i hate the game even more now realizing what i needed . pure bs
 AntiSquid: bullshit
 AntiSquid: :D
 UndercoverToad: oh :D
 jrke: getting depth 25 in 66ms in BS i am 90% sure its bug
 UndercoverToad: i read that as "it's easy to get a top rank, just code a beam search"
 AntiSquid: no no .
 UndercoverToad: it's possible jrke. if you have a very narrow beam
 jrke: 400
 jrke: beam width = 400
 AntiSquid: i keep reading BS as bullshit though lol
 UndercoverToad: that's insane. i have way less and sweating not to time out
 UndercoverToad: lower depth as well
 Clagus: it's like Elon said - abbreviations are cancer :P
 AntiSquid: i think going lower depth also helped with rank
 VizGhar: lower = deeper?
 alchemsti: I'm impressed with people getting sub-200 without simulation / beam search etc.
 alchemsti: I'm not doing a "proper" eval, i.e. using all information, but I'm not doing a trivial one either, and only ~450&#160;:(
 alchemsti: Guess I'll have to code up that BS. (ambiguity intentional :D )
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I think there are a few people in top 100 without any simulation
 Thienu: good heuristics can approximate searches pretty well in this game imo
 alchemsti: Well, if your eval is good enough, you don't need to simulate
 alchemsti: :D
 alchemsti: Yeah, that was my thought too
 alchemsti: but getting the heuristics good ...
 Thienu: mines still pretty simple
 alchemsti: And tuning the damn parameters
 Thienu: and im top 100
 alchemsti: Respect!
 Thienu: but yeah beam search might be an easier way to get there :sweat_smile:
 alchemsti: Do you want to give a vague description? I'm trying to balance things like shading my enemy, not shading myself,
 alchemsti: and balancing cost vs payoff
 alchemsti: and balancing harvest vs. growth
 darkhorse64: Actually, heuristics tend to eval moves (not always) when bs evals states. So moving to bs may not be straightforward
 solistice: ugh, transformed all the game code to c# for simulating
 solistice: now I have to actually start thinking on what algorithm to use&#160;:') 
 jrke: depth 4minimax loses with depth 1 bot everytime&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: your AI prefers to WAIT&#160;?
 jrke: yes a lot thats a bug i am trying to figure
 supershah: procastinating by changing language instead of trying to write an algorithm
 darkhorse64: Actually, it's more than a bug. WAIT is the end of a sequence so should only eval and compare WAIT, GROW + WAIT, GROW + SEED + WAIT. That's what euler said yesterday (he talks too much but it's a very thorough remark)
 AntiSquid: 700s range :O Automaton2000 let's celebrate
 Automaton2000: tell them to go to the left
 AntiSquid: go to the left guys
 Mourfette: I can't find my friend in the list to add him as an opponent. but he is silver like me, any reason?
 RoboStac: the list is limited to the top 1000
 RoboStac: in that league
 Mourfette: ah, well, that explains it
 alchemsti: darkhorse64 - yes but moves are just deltas between states. But it can mean needing to change a lot&#160;:/
 LLG: my sims only takes about 60% of the total time my engine takes to complete 1 turn
 LLG: idk where the other 40% went
 ddreams: I think the search function should not have a top 1000 player limit
 dbdr: Thienu: for profiling, it depends on your language, OS, IDE, ...
 ddreams: I'd like to check out the catboss, for example
 dbdr: I use perf on linux with rust
 Thienu: ah alright, I'll have to look into it then, thanks
 AntiSquid: 600s&#160;! so ya just need to work the eval ... Automaton2000 give me some ideas
 MSmits: UndercoverToad I have 1000 beam width and 20 depth and dont time out even with your sun calc :P
 Automaton2000: man i am so bad at coding
 MSmits: this is how useless performance is compared to eval
 AntiSquid: what MSmits said
 UndercoverToad: how do you even define depth? days or actions?
 MSmits: actions, where i keep going until the last state is waiting
 MSmits: so a day is generally 4 turns
 MSmits: so my depth is 5 days more or less
 MSmits: but as darkhorse64 says, with lower depth it isnt really better
 MSmits: my eval is crap
 MSmits: and until i figure out how it should be, i will not improve
 darkhorse64: mine is worse
 AntiSquid: i added some crappy extra heuristics and if you'd read the eval you'd agree it's crap, but it gave me higher rank MSmits, so yes eval is power
 darkhorse64: Actually, I am not sure. I think my algo sucks even more
 Zedster82: mine sucks more
 AntiSquid: we need to come up with a metric to see which eval is worse, we can't just keep bragging
 RoboStac: if only there was some sort of leaderboard based on battles between bots
 darkhorse64: yeah, I am complaining but there are 4k ppl behind. I don't want to look behind
 AntiSquid: ya would be nice
 UndercoverToad: 5k even
 itzluku: imo depth = days but with only partial (your_next,opp_next) move tupels, because of limiting factors
 jrke: i am not sure whats happening with me 
 jrke: is there in bug in my referee or in algo not getting anything or bad eval
 ddreams: locally?
 ddreams: I guess so, since you say "my referee"
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/551986111">https://www.codingame.com/replay/551986111</a>funny, how similar bots already got
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: test your eval against "return rand()"
 UndercoverToad: and then I have the sun disadvantage in frame 28
 Nagatwin: What kind of algorithm is that Euler&#160;?
 Mourfette: UndercoverToad you start by waiting, growing tree one, the waiting, growing tree 2 then seed. isn't it best to seed first i case of your seed location gets taken first? or is it taken into consideration in your process so you know there are no way it is taken in that case?
 RoboStac: but you can't seed the middle until after the grow
 Mourfette: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ebaa5dcc-7e73-422f-9ec4-a9e0f28f11fc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ebaa5dcc-7e73-422f-9ec4-a9e0f28f11fc</a>
 Mourfette: oh, guess there is a char limit in chat :D
 BorisBarca: guys im getting this:Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 BorisBarca: does anyone else have this problem?
 darkhorse64: Skril stats likely mean beam width/nodes. 
 BorisBarca: been trying to fix it for a couple of hours
 Mourfette: you tried to console.Writeline but there are still inputs waiting to be read
 ddreams: Do you use the c++ starter ai?
 RoboStac: BorisBarca - it usually means you are outputting multiple prints per turn
 darkhorse64: he does not spend all time searching
 BorisBarca: wait you can only do 1 action?
 BorisBarca: and i use starter ai
 ddreams: one action per turn, but many actions in a day
 ddreams: some people reported a bug in the input reader of the c++ starter ai
 Mourfette: one per turn, not one per day. until you send WAIT, it is still the same day, but still a new turn
 ddreams: something about not reading SEED and GROW possible actions properly
 BorisBarca: oh...
 BorisBarca: can you send link to right version?
 ddreams: I used the IDE starter code, had no problems
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/starterAIs/starter.cpp#L97">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/starterAIs/starter.cpp#L97</a> 
 RoboStac: it's been updated - do you have those lines reading grow / seed&#160;?
 BorisBarca: no I don't, I have tottaly something other
 UndercoverToad: Nagatwin 11:10AMWhat kind of algorithm is that Euler&#160;?
 BorisBarca: I noticed that the variebles don't match the ones in the statement
 darkhorse64: with twists
 UndercoverToad: and duct tape
 RoboStac: are you actually using the starter from github or the one that was given in the IDE?
 BorisBarca: the one that was given in ide
 RoboStac: ok, don't worry about any of the above then, that was fine
 RoboStac: it's most likely multiple prints per input 
 darkhorse64: duct&#160;? :slight_smile:
 dbdr: yeah, noticed that too. hidden hint? :D
 darkhorse64: he is trolling us mere mortals
 UndercoverToad: i would never dare
 ddreams: noticed what?
 BorisBarca: ok, I didn't understand what now, should I use AI from github or the one in IDE
 ddreams: both are probably fine now, boris
 BorisBarca: ok thx
 ddreams: but make sure you don't output anything before you have read all the input, and that you don't output multiple actions in a turn
 ddreams: dbdr and darkhorse64, you think it's called duck tape?&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: DUCT = decoupled UCT
 UndercoverToad: UCT = Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees
 AntiSquid: backpropagating beamsearch? :D
 darkhorse64: double bs&#160;? 
 UndercoverToad: no magic going on in my bot, very straight forward
 darkhorse64: says #4
 RoboStac: so we know the duct part of his bot now, what is the tape part?
 darkhorse64: it's the tie that binds
 UndercoverToad: tape = string
 UndercoverToad: that's how I store my internal states
 Nagatwin: Thanks UndercoverToad
 tarriel: BorisBarca I usually get this message when I am printing debug info to the normal output, rather than the error.
 Mourfette: What rules do you apply to choose best seed? no neighbor, not in line with the thrower?
 Mourfette: At my level I see many just fillin the whole green center with their trees, but then most of them are in shadow all the time
 LLG: how do you guys check for visited states?
 UndercoverToad: hashsets
 LLG: HashSet is slow for me because I have a Dictionary&lt;int, Tree&gt; and comparing those are very slow
 LLG: maybe the dictionary is the problem
 Mourfette: what's the int for?
 LLG: locations
 LLG: just so I can quickly get a tree's data by location
 Mourfette: is that better than the tree class having the location index?
 Karlox: is it smart to go on c++ as your 1st language?
 synchoz: if u know it well :D
 synchoz: im just kidding but yeah C++ is great language to start with if u want to start with language that is not super easy but not super hard either like C 
 LLG: Mourfette my tree class does have a location index
 Nerchio: why not
 synchoz: damn why didnt i think of Tree class a C# bot develop :S
 LLG: but for example, if I were to simulate growing a tree, currently I do state.Trees[grow_target].Size += 1
 LLG: if instead of a Dictionary&lt;int, Tree&gt; i have a List&lt;Tree&gt;
 LLG: I have no way of getting the correct tree to increase the size, other than iterating through the entire collection
 ddreams: in C#?
 LLG: yes
 ddreams: then you can use array indexing
 ddreams: C# lists are arraylists
 LLG: yeah but then the index doesn't necessarily correlates to the tree's cellIndex
 ddreams: it does if you use the same both places
 BorisBarca: cout &lt;&lt; "GROW " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl; This line sends me that debug message
 darkhorse64: Use real arrays[37] [problem solved]
 BorisBarca: i is the index of cell
 BorisBarca: I'm so pissed of for this man
 LLG: oh ddreams you meant like
 LLG: when I'm reading trees from input
 LLG: if cellIndex = 5 I do Trees[5] = new Tree...
 ddreams: Boris, put a single "cout &lt;&lt; action &lt;&lt; endl" at the end of the main loop
 ddreams: no other cout anywhere
 ddreams: then you can only output once per round
 ddreams: and always after you have read everything
 BorisBarca: I have cout &lt;&lt; "Wait" &lt;&lt; endl; at the end
 derjack: two couts?
 ddreams: and no other cout anywhere?
 BorisBarca: I have 4 more couts
 ddreams: exactly
 ddreams: so... you haven't done what I said
 ddreams: make a "string action" and set it where you have the couts now
 BorisBarca: ok, if I understand you correctly can i have a queue of actions and then cout it in 1 for loop?
 ddreams: you can only output ONE action per turn
 ddreams: so no queue of actions
 LLG: ddreams my State is a struct atm, not a class. Is there any way to initialize a fixed size (37) array of Trees in it?
 BorisBarca: So I can't have GROW 5 SEED 4 3 WAIT?
 ddreams: Tree trees[37], I guess
 derjack: BorisBarca no
 BorisBarca: aaah fuck
 LLG: lemme see if it compiles
 BorisBarca: thanks a lot guys
 BorisBarca: i thought that you could make more actions in a single day
 derjack: you can
 ddreams: you can, but a day is many turns
 Mgs25: Hiiii!
 limakk: per turn an action&#160;?
 derjack: you can do what you said, just once per while(true) iteration
 LLG: compiler complains about Tree trees[37] -&gt; Array size cannot be specified in a variable declaration
 BorisBarca: ok I think I got it
 LLG: if I do Tree trees = new Tree[37] I get Cannot have instance property or field initializers in structs
 alchemsti: which language LLG?
 LLG: c#
 LLG: idk if there's any merits in keeping my State a struct tho
 LLG: might just make it a class
 alchemsti: ha, sorry, can't help. You should consider whether you need it as a fixed size array -- or is generic size with reserve hint close enough.
 actualCoderTrevor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18772718/array-of-structs-example">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18772718/array-of-structs-example</a> first result on Google&#160;:)
 actualCoderTrevor: The syntax of C# is just different enough from C++ to keep you guessing, lol
 derjack: ++ is that different from # eh
 Dahll: Guys what algorithm are you using&#160;? I don't know if it is useful that useful to simulate opponent turn
 ddreams: beam search
 Momtaz: Can you get the last action your opponent made at the start of a round? Like if they completed a tree?
 ddreams: no
 ddreams: you can figure it out though
 ddreams: but it was probably WAIT :p
 stefan-gg: is there any time limit in which i can go to silver&#160;?
 dbdr: until the end of the contest
 ddreams: and later it will open up again
 itzluku: the depth of beam search is limited to time and ram space with the selection of best options to get the best overall being choosed by heuristics? so even your sim has to implement some kind of heuristic to preselect from all possible options?
 itzluku: chosen* xd
 dbdr: itzluku the principle of beam search is that you limit the width
 dbdr: that's how it differs from DFS
 dbdr: BFS, sorry
 itzluku: yeh ok so prettmuch with me kinda maxing my heuristic i have almost everything setup for beamsearch?
 dbdr: can you give a score to a state and generate all possible next states?
 itzluku: since i could just take top3 seed top3 grow and top 3 complete options as a limited width
 itzluku: score yes
 itzluku: gen all possible next states not for opp , so i have to do that
 jrke: beam search is BFS in which you evaluate each node at each depth and keep max BEAM_WIDTH best nodes for next depth
 dbdr: you don't have to do opp
 itzluku: wut why
 itzluku: are u not both making a turn the same time? thought thats why u can palce a seed on teh same index and both seeds get destroyed
 itzluku: place*
 jrke: dbdr do you still don't predict anything for opponent?
 dbdr: I do predict something
 dbdr: not super clear how much it helps
 itzluku: @dbdr my thought was every possible new state is def by your next action combined with the action of your opp (your_move,opp_move) meaning u have nr of moves by u * nr of moves by opp as oevrall nr ove pos new states
 rc_legend: Hello
 itzluku: and u reduce that width by saying u only make pairs of the best of those 
 rc_legend: anyone here?
 itzluku: but u would still need to calc everythinf for your opp*&#160;?
 rc_legend: who can talk with me
 itzluku: everything*
 dbdr: itzluku to get started, juste suppose the opponent will WAIT. you can get top 10 with that
 itzluku: wtf no way
 rc_legend: wtf
 jrke: dbdr with good eval right?
 jrke: and good depth
 dbdr: "good"&#160;:)
 rc_legend: hello&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: i agree with dbdr, even top5 with a WAITing opponent is possible
 actualCoderTrevor: :O
 UndercoverToad: might change during the week but i think it's really hard to simulate the opponent in a meaningful way
 dbdr: I was #1 with that until recently :D
 UndercoverToad: i only got up to #2&#160;:(
 dbdr: noob
 UndercoverToad: jolin dien too over
 jrke: btw what depth you guys reach in BS atm?
 itzluku: still dont know what your main acc is lol
 itzluku: toad
 itzluku: :D
 UndercoverToad: hover over my avatar and read the text
 itzluku: lel
 itzluku: moin meister
 jrke: when i  hovered over you first time i read 'cheating' instead of 'chatting'
 UndercoverToad: and then do the same with my main account. that will tell you that i'm a noob
 dbdr: lol
 UndercoverToad: my cheating account :D
 struct: the time you got 2nd
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/vdsqIsf.png">https://i.imgur.com/vdsqIsf.png</a>
 itzluku: so the upside of just making your opp wait in the sim is, that u can have a higehr depth in your beamsearch, meaning u can evaluate more of your own possible choices?
 geppoz: :O
 geppoz: just added "if (false)" to my enemy prediction
 RoboStac: hmm, struct has a smitsimax tab open. Secret tips for the contest?
 geppoz: up to 1000 positions
 geppoz: :O
 dbdr: :spy:
 geppoz: can be really that crap to predict?
 itzluku: btw whats your function to score a board&#160;? wouldn't the easiest methode be checking sun diff and point diff with changing the weigth of those to depending on teh day, so at the end points have more weigth and at the start/mid suns weight more&#160;?
 itzluku: method*
 AntiSquid: and mctstalk in chat
 struct: someone was asking on chat about simultaneous mcts
 struct: So I linked him smisi
 struct: smitsi
 itzluku: two*
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 solistice: what's your guys' approach: copy the state whenever applying an action in a sim, or just apply/undo/
 solistice: *?
 dbdr: copz
 dbdr: copy
 schachmatt: dbdr you also struggling to get used to qwertz?
 itzluku: can u talk more about that?
 itzluku: what to store at each new node
 dbdr: I have US-int layout on qwertyz keyboard, yes :D
 UndercoverToad: qwertyz? :D
 dbdr: :D
 derjack: on XP there was shortcut to change y to z and people were constantly hitting it
 UndercoverToad: alt+shift survived even after XP
 UndercoverToad: one i was in a local electronics store buying a hard diskanother customer approached the sales person in need of a new keyboard
 UndercoverToad: a bit of back and forth and it was clear that it was just changed to US layout
 dbdr: good reason to buy new hardware
 dbdr: oh, I set a low depth for testing and forgot to change it before sub :D
 itzluku: stil lcant believe a sim where u just pretend your opp always waits gets top10
 dbdr: try it and see for yourself&#160;;)
 itzluku: yeh u just motivated me to do that :D before i was like emh idk if i can do it
 itzluku: meh*
 struct: ok, say bye to your rank
 struct: im coming
 aangairbender: how big is your state size?
 struct:  /s
 itzluku: LUL
 dbdr: gogogo struct
 struct: mine is 96 bytes
 aangairbender: Mine is around 40
 struct: 40 bytes?
 itzluku: and beam depth?
 aangairbender: oh, my bad, 40 bytes for trees
 dbdr: screenshot time for the toad
 itzluku: xd
 aangairbender: struct its 61bytes total
 itzluku: dbdr whats your state size
 itzluku: and depth
 aangairbender: I tried to make it less than 64 for cache line
 itzluku: board+weight&#160;?
 dbdr: itzluku talk less and code more&#160;;)
 itzluku: na talk saves time for later xd
 struct: I could make it 64, but I dont think its needed
 aangairbender: how many sims can you do in 100ms?
 struct: 1Mill+
 KalamariKing: jesus
 KalamariKing: chill
 itzluku: i thought about traversing only 1 board through the tree and only save moves in each node, then i would only need like 48bit!!!
 itzluku: but that would prob kill runtime?
 aangairbender: wow, I optimized my code still around 300k (including generation all possible actions each time and selection random one)
 struct: I didnt really care about optimizing
 struct: tbh
 aangairbender: still got 1M+ sims:joy:
 struct: Its irrelevant 
 UndercoverToad: dbdr 01:04PMscreenshot time for the toad
 struct: if eval is heavy it will lower
 aangairbender: but you still generate all possible moves and select random one for testing perfomance right?
 struct: I generate and play  until end of day and then eval
 UndercoverToad: no eval during day already?
 UndercoverToad: to keep the beam narrow
 aangairbender: I see, I was also thinking about about doing eval in the end of the day only
 UndercoverToad: and don't forget to submit struct
 struct: I have
 struct: Ill submit soon
 struct: maybe tomorrow
 UndercoverToad: you just made me laugh
 UndercoverToad: or keep it. maybe you become the silver boss
 struct: So many people in silver already
 struct: damn
 jrke: struct haven't you made any submit after getting down from 1st?
 struct: I need to start coding
 struct: I havent
 Nerchio: struct you wrote that yesterday already :D
 jrke: what could be the opening window for gold?
 UndercoverToad: 300 sounds realistic to me
 struct: I hope 10%
 UndercoverToad: but i was wrong about silver too
 KalamariKing: Anyone here know java
 gmessier: I will be happy if it's around 600 :P
 jrke: i thought max 1250 for silver
 Hasuzawa: just ask this is the world chat someone will know
 jrke: but they made 1850
 KalamariKing: Why is nextInt() throwing InputMismatchException when the input is 0? It works for everything else
 KalamariKing: I mean 0 as in string literal "0"
 UndercoverToad: you mean random.nextInt()?
 KalamariKing: (Scanner).nextInt
 derjack: what lang
 KalamariKing: Java
 UndercoverToad: java
 UndercoverToad: bug must be somewhere else
 KalamariKing: Every other integer works and I know that the next token is "0"
 UndercoverToad: like you reading more or less that you want
 UndercoverToad: reading a 0 works fine

 KalamariKing: Hmm, thanksIt was working earlier so it's probably somewhere else
 Nerchio: my eval is the dumbest i've ever seen and every small change completely crashes the evaluation
 UndercoverToad: without clicking I expect a rickroll behind that youtube link
 jrke: i can't make out any good eval
 derjack: you dont know rick roll code?
 KalamariKing: If there are two Scanner objects do they share a 'cursor'

 ddreams: hoping for a top 1000?
 struct: no legend
 itzluku: i mean if u set your opp to wait, then its still luck based by alot
 UndercoverToad: because that top20 would mean you wasted your tshirt chance because of testing?
 itzluku: tshirt? :O
 itzluku: more motivation xd
 UndercoverToad: 20 tshirts and 3 canvases up for grabs
 itzluku: Pog

 UndercoverToad: get 1 more XP
 struct: yeah probably got stuck
 UndercoverToad: just gave you an upvite
 UndercoverToad: upvote
 struct: ah
 struct: lol
 struct: thanks
 AntiSquid: technically legend boss is always the #1 player in legend 
 UndercoverToad: hey you are lvl30 now&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: with 79XP. but I only gave you 1
 struct: now Im ready for gold
 KalamariKing: omg this took so long, who wants to see how poorly this goes
 solistice: Can someone give me some small guidance? I have trouble disconnecting the main game from the simulation I am making without duplicating all code
 solistice: I could use some small pointers
 solistice: Here or in PM
 KalamariKing: no way
 KalamariKing: no freaking way
 KalamariKing: #1 bois
 KalamariKing: solistice elaborate?
 solistice: so, I basically rewrote the java referee and game to c# to be able to have all actions and normal gameplay
 KalamariKing: I thought they already had a referee
 solistice: and then there is the main loop where it waits for input, so that's clear
 KalamariKing: I forget who wrote it but str​uct should know
 solistice: but now, in that loop I want to calculate the best action, so I call my method there
 solistice: but for simulating in depth, I create copies of the game, but now I have to disconnect the main game loop where it reads input and so on from my simulation, where I just ignore everything 
 KalamariKing: I think I get it?
 KalamariKing: How I did it was I had a func that would evaluate the best move, when fed a game state. For the top 'beams' I used the inputs, the lower branches used the game after said best move
 KalamariKing: tl;dr write a func that takes in gamestate, then pass either inputs or past move
 Nerchio: I just simulate the next states and then you eval them
 Asterixk: solstice you cannot let the main loop cycle over, you need your own simulation loop inside the main  loop
 solistice: makes sense
 solistice: thx everyone
 KalamariKing: Sure
 KalamariKing: Can you all believe it? I spent all this time worrying and perfecting, just to go undefeated by a long shot
 schachmatt: how many players are there usually in gold and legend at the end of a contest?
 KalamariKing: How many people are in silver rn
 struct: 2632
 KalamariKing: Thats a lot
 KalamariKing: Oh welcome back str​uct
 Asterixk: once i got legend on opening day, and there were about 100 players and it ended with around 500
 struct: previous contest legend opened with 20 players
 Nerchio: legend usually ends with less than 150 people at the end of the contest i think
 KalamariKing: oh wow
 KalamariKing: Thats not a lot
 Nerchio: but depends on gold boss if its hard or not
 struct: The best thing is to wait and get pushed
 Asterixk: it was the one with the 2 racing pods per player. CSB i guess
 Nerchio: you need to put quite some work into legend for sure
 7amasa: Nerchio arent you gonna stream soon :D?
 Nerchio: my code got messed up thers no point
 Nerchio: i am just changing random variables now
 Nerchio: with no hope in sight
 solavegeta: test
 solistice: oh, i think it finally makes sense
 7amasa: I think we could still learn alot through the though process, I did in the first stream Nerhcio
 solistice: turns are not only actions we do, but also gathering and sun move and so on? right?
 Asterixk: generating next state? yep
 Nerchio: i mean you are at the same rank as me i can probably learn from you haha :d
 Asterixk: i mean generating next day
 7amasa: haha nahh I am just randomly trying stuff, however your first stream helped me a lot
 struct: nerchio streamed?
 7amasa: yeah on the starting day I think
 Nerchio: but on my 2nd channel with only cg viewers
 KalamariKing: How am I in the top 34% in bronze without seeding or shadows
 struct: lol
 Hasuzawa: believe me or not, I saw a bot crash in 2 turns from a top 20% bronze bot
 Nerchio: every change i make to my bot needs to be followed by 150games vs my previous version ;p
 Nerchio: breaks too easily
 AllYourTrees: does anyone know of a website where you can play Photosynthesis?
 jacek: CG :v
 AllYourTrees: &gt;.&gt;
 aangairbender: fyi rules are not the same
 AllYourTrees: oh which ones are different?
 aangairbender: I mean CG changed the original rules for this contest
 struct: i dont think its simultaneous

 Zanoshky: does anyone have unit test per round for java version?
 miszu: good morning children
 Zanoshky: good morning master
 Kellthazar: Hi!
 miszu: anyone reached silver league?
 Zanoshky: 2651 ppl did
 Marchete: 2651 players
 Kellthazar: 2651 people, to be precise.
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: :D
 Kellthazar: XD
 miszu: god damnit
 Marchete: that's contagious
 miszu: let me try it again
 miszu: anyone from the chat reached silver lol
 derjack: no
 miszu: forgot I am surrounded by developers lol
 Marchete: what do you need?
 Marchete: I'm botton silver anyways
 Zanoshky: yeah, how can i help man?
 miszu: I am botton silver too
 Zanoshky: me to, i an mid silver
 miszu: I barely made it yesterday
 BigGibbo: hello
 MrSharpFork: yes
 miszu: 2006th in silver
 miszu: i was like 1800 yesterday
 MrSharpFork: 1st in wood 3 :sunglasses:
 Marchete: so what do you need?
 BigGibbo: on a scale of 1 to alphabet how do you like your cheese on toast?
 k_mizev: how many&#160;% going to proceed to gold, who knows?
 Marchete: 500
 Marchete: according to previous contest
 k_mizev: ah good, thank you, it is my 1st one
 Charlie.eilrahC: hello

 NissanGTR205: Hello Ethan
 Charlie.eilrahC: okay
 Daddy_Pig: wysssss me chaviessssss
 Charlie.eilrahC: hi dassy
 Charlie.eilrahC: daddy*
 Mr_Bowden_init: bruv
 lankyFish: my drillaaaaa
 sussybacka: wag11111111111
 sussybacka: ur such a sussy backa
 sussybacka: mr bowden
 sussybacka: :rage:
 sussybacka: or should i say
 sussybacka: harrison
 Charlie.eilrahC: you should
 miszu: anyone who reached top silver without sims?
 sussybacka: shush
 miszu: I believe if you have strong heuristic, you can do good moves at each turn
 miszu: without sims
 sussybacka: i believe youre a nonce
 aangairbender: miszu I am around top100 without sim
 Charlie.eilrahC: whats sim?
 aangairbender: simulation
 Charlie.eilrahC: what do you mean by that?
 miszu: like in chess, you predidt couple moves in advance
 Danifae: 378 in silver, no simulations :P
 Charlie.eilrahC: idk how to play this
 miszu: how you guys handled? Is it bunch if if else and magic threshold numbers?
 NissanGTR205: what do we do here?
 MrSharpFork: ferrari &gt; nissan
 Charlie.eilrahC: i dont know how to play this game
 aangairbender: I have bunch of if else and some heuristics from notebook
 BigGibbo: u all smell
 aangairbender: came up with some ideas on paper and implemented them
 NissanGTR205: i agree ferrari is good but nissan can be better
 Charlie.eilrahC: you on about clash?
 sussybacka: clash of clans is poggers
 Charlie.eilrahC: of course
 ZarthaxX: aangairbender i saw that you memed with an eval of only score + suns/3, i guess you were trolling lol
 dabonitwagwan: what do you mean by sim&#160;??
 Daddy_Pig: that was pure waffle 
 lankyFish: shut up you batty boy
 Daddy_Pig: like bum dribble
 Nerchio: i use score + sun/3 in the last 4 turns idk :p
 Nerchio: and some bonus for finishing trees 
 aangairbender: ZarthaxX I am working on beam search, needed some eval function, so I did score + suns/3. It isnt good of course. My arena heuristic bot is much stronger
 Astrobytes: That's 3 of your classmates kicked children, now behave or you get kicked too. Then you get banned.
 ZarthaxX: ahhh your arena bot is different, ok
 miszu: Astrobytes you kicked people just now?
 Mr_Bowden_init: oh now im really scared 
 Marchete: are you working on your bot, ZarthaxX?
 Mr_Bowden_init: im shivering in my boots 
 Astrobytes: Yes miszu.
 LLG: are starting/stopping stopwatches in c# expensive?
 aangairbender: I believe they are not expensive
 ZarthaxX: Marchete trying but failing&#160;:)
 Marchete: task failed succesfully
 LLG: rn I have 3 different stopwatches that starts/stops every sim so I could track the time taken by move gen, sims and evals
 ZarthaxX: im not suited for this game i guess
 ZarthaxX: what about you marcho
 sussybacka: astrobyte on smoke
 sussybacka: pop off sis
 aangairbender: LLG you can always remove them before submit
 dabonitwagwan: how do you move up leagues 
 sussybacka: by being good lol
 dabonitwagwan: and positioions 
 LLG: yeah but idk if they affect my diagnosis or not 
 aangairbender: even if they add several millis that's not important
 LLG: yeah cause I'm seeing total time = 98ms
 LLG: but the sum of the 3 parts are just 92ms
 LLG: so idk where those few millis went
 Marchete: you can't pinpoint that much
 KalamariKing: Starting/stopping clocks?
 Marchete: 100ms is more like 90-95ms
 LLG: stopwatches in c#, yes
 KalamariKing: Or clock cycle fluctuations
 miszu: what is more important when throwing seeds, to not be in line or to reach a higher richness?
 ashelkov: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".

 aangairbender: miszu it depends
 KalamariKing: miszu that's the strategy part of the contest, you'll have to figure that out
 LLG: I personally do shadows first, then richness
 LLG: but yeah it depends
 Gaurav.: print("Hello World!")
 LLG: do you guys generate a lot of duplicate states when simming?
 Mr_Yanti: print("help")
 LLG: cause I think my bot is generating way too much dupes than it should
 Marchete: use hashing to avoid duplicates
 aangairbender: everybody uses some kind of hashset to remove duplicates
 LLG: I do use hash
 Gaurav.: print("what do u want?")
 aangairbender: everybody but me
 itzluku: fun part about sims is, your dont even need to know what the decition tree looks like
 LLG: but the thing is, when the hashes match
 LLG: you have to compare the actual content of the states
 Mr_Yanti: print("shut up")
 BigBoyCharlie: u guys are sweats wow
 LLG: which is slow for me
 BigBoyCharlie: how long u been playing?
 NissanGTR205: so 50 states?
 BigBoyCharlie: u spoke no words. just mumble
 NissanGTR205: or 49 as hawaii is not a state
 LLG: aangairbender right now my bot takes ~20ms each turn just to compare states 
 KalamariKing: actually yeah it is
 LLG: idk how to improve that part yet
 itzluku: is the school period over or why is this chat so bad rn
 aangairbender: my bot times on on turn 2 with beam with 50
 BigBoyCharlie: nearly over bb
 aangairbender: times out*
 KalamariKing: there's a lot of trolls ig? its still school time in the US
 Astrobytes: It's a class of kids yeah, I think I've kicked all but one
 Astrobytes: Ah thanks struct
 itzluku: gj
 LLG: I'm setting depth 10 with beam width 100 rn
 LLG: but it always times out at like depth 6-7
 struct: well lower depth or width&#160;:)
 struct: or make it faster
 aangairbender: my advice is making lower depth, bigger width
 LLG: &gt;make it faster, that's what I'm trying to
 itzluku: timeout because of runtime or memory?
 LLG: runtime
 itzluku: ah good to know
 aangairbender: timout cause I exceeded 100ms
 itzluku: python?
 LLG: I'm on c#
 aangairbender: rust, which is not usual for rust
 LLG: struct, when I compare 2 hashes of 2 states for duplicate
 struct: ah 
 LLG: if the hashes match, I have to compare the actual content as well, right?
 struct: I dont do that
 LLG: wait really? so you check all the dupes
 struct: I dont check for dupes
 Marchete: collision chance for a good hash is low
 LLG: I mean, you sim all the dupes out
 struct: no
 aangairbender: LLG some langs provide that, for e.g. rust can create hashing code automatically
 struct: I dont check for dupes at all
 LLG: thing is, I don't have problems with different states having colliding hashes
 LLG: I'm having problem with identical states 
 Marchete: identical states different hash?
 LLG: since they have identical hashes, I have to check the actual content to see if they're dupes or not
 Marchete: lol
 Nerchio: that sounds very backwards
 LLG: because that's how HashSet works in c# lol
 Marchete: what hash are you using?
 LLG: it first checks using GetHashCode()
 LLG: then by Equals()
 Marchete: ahh
 ashelkov: can I do smth with it&gt;??OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 LLG: I'm just using hash = 37
 LLG: then hash += 397 * my_stuff.GetHashCode()
 LLG: repeat until I run out of my_stuff
 Marchete: override GetHashCode then
 LLG: ^ that's my override
 LLG: wait that code was wrong
 LLG: hash = 37;hash = hash * 397 + my_stuff.GetHashCode()
 LLG: the hashing function is fast
 LLG: the problem is that when trying to add an identical state to a HashSet
 Marchete: 64 or 32 bits?
 LLG: C# goes: ah there's a matching hash, let's compare the actual values using Equals() to see if they're actually identical
 LLG: ^ this part is slow
 LLG: the hash itself is an Int32
 Marchete: then override Equals
 Marchete: Equals =&gt; return hash == o.hash
 LLG: I also override Equals
 itzluku: btw LLG width 100&#160;???
 LLG: yes width 100
 itzluku: wtf
 Marchete: ask euler
 aangairbender: LLG is that behavior for insert? or for lookup as well?
 Marchete: he is top10 with C#
 itzluku: when do u ever get to 100
 LLG: for insert I believe
 itzluku: wtf
 AntiSquid: you can easily get over 1000
 LLG: I don't do lookup on states anyway, just iterate over anything
 aangairbender: then you should write better GetHashCode
 itzluku: well  ucan filter it up to like 20 moves id say
 aangairbender: with lower collision chance
 LLG: the thing is not with GetHashCode, I timed my hashes and they only take 1-2ms a turn
 itzluku: and even picking like top 10 estimated out of them would be a solid width
 AntiSquid: 3000 - 4000 nodes on average per depth (for most part) so you can have a width of that size 
 itzluku: wtf 100 xD
 itzluku: ah
 itzluku: u mean width for that
 LLG: thing is, almost all collisions occured because the states are actually identical (which means it shouldn't be added)
 AntiSquid: for my bot anyway
 itzluku: i wouldnt cap that width
 aangairbender: LLG your hashes are fast, but they cause a lot of collisions, resolving which is slow
 itzluku: i thought that is the point, u dont cap that width
 aangairbender: ah, I see
 LLG: they collide because the actual content is identical
 LLG: there's no way identical states won't have colliding hashes
 AntiSquid: i want to yell at the screen "climb higher"
 AntiSquid: gently
 aangairbender: you can check with Contain before insert
 aangairbender: so it will check hash only
 LLG: but then won't Insert itself checks both the hash and the content?
 aangairbender: then insert wont happen when hashes are equal
 LLG: oh wait that's actually very clever
 LLG: lemme try that
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: Contains is always the first thing to do
 Marchete: in fact, how were you doing it?
 LLG: ... I just called HashSet.Add
 Marchete:&#160;?!
 aangairbender: but you need to check Contains for pushing to queue
 LLG: yeah I know, it sounds very dumb now that I reflect on it
 LLG: my thought process was that HashSet.Add already checks for duplicate so I didn't need to do anything
 Marchete: according to the method, it seems so
 aangairbender: my beam search isnt working:sob:
 KelvinAndHubbles: My bot is always having a problem defeating the bots that sacrifice all of their trees and the end of the game. I have code which sacs the trees earlier depending on when it thinks the enemies trees will sac, but the enemy trees dont sac and instead they gain big tree advantage and the depletion of nutrient value that I try to lower
 aangairbender: sim alone does 300k/100msbut beam search fails to do 5 depth with beam width 500
 UndercoverToad: my width is below 50
 struct: o.o
 ZarthaxX: O.O
 aangairbender: 0.0
 struct: width 50 dfepth 100
 UndercoverToad: ôô
 UndercoverToad: as I said "below 50"
 aangairbender: and you eval in the end of the day?
 UndercoverToad: significantly below
 UndercoverToad: after each action
 miszu: I don't think sims is the key for this challenge
 miszu: if only the top 10 people could answer that question lol
 UndercoverToad: it is part of the key I think
 aangairbender: sims always win, you can apply all your heurstic to the sim
 ZarthaxX: i think eval is more key haha
 miszu: def eval
 UndercoverToad: both are useless for itself
 aangairbender: eval is a measure how how the state is
 ZarthaxX: by itself?
 UndercoverToad: thanks grammar Nazi
 ZarthaxX: np&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: just trying to help&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: i like mazelcop. Always willing to push me up
 UndercoverToad: but now i want to submit and test something&#160;:(
 Mazelcop: always a pleasure&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: how's your progress? still ideas for improvements?
 UndercoverToad: i'm plateauing
 Mazelcop: I'm trying to understand how to win this game
 jrke: i am unable to find even an average eval&#160;;(
 Mazelcop: without must success
 Mazelcop: *much
 struct: Just wait until my NN is done
 miszu: honestly, look at top performers and try to study how they do it
 UndercoverToad: then we have the same problems
 Marchete: they are the top performers
 miszu: so study them!
 Marchete: ok!
 ddreams: study yourselves
 miszu: struct ETA?
 Marchete: :thinking:
 struct: 2025
 RoboStac: what if they can't understand what they are doing?
 ddreams: what's the point of studying something you already understand?
 aangairbender: their simulation finds good moves, so people can understand how to play this game
 aangairbender: search find heuristics, which then boost search. it never ends
 LLG: I ended up just usingreturn GetHashCode() == obj.GetHashCode()
 LLG: and accept that it might add a duplicate state if the hashes collide
 miszu: I'll write a pseudo code that is fool proof for you guys
 UndercoverToad: that's how I imagine struct and his NN<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/os4DcbpL0Nc?t=1090">https://youtu.be/os4DcbpL0Nc?t=1090</a>

 UndercoverToad: func? is that Go or something?
 UndercoverToad: because in Kotlin it's just fun
 miszu: pseudo code
 reCurse: Doesn't seem realistic, only took 3 days to get it to work
 miszu: are you planning to submit?
 UndercoverToad: *click*
 kovi: bonsai, so that is why tend to keep lvl1 trees!
 7amasa: Nerchio congrats bro, impressive 
 Nerchio: thanks i guess :P
 schachmatt: struct what data are you using to train your NN
 struct: pen and paper
 dbdr: that's why it will take years
 schachmatt: the old fashioned way, I rate that
 jrke: i want a eval but can't get what to do
 reCurse: The OG NN
 reCurse: The mushy messy kind
 7amasa: Nerchio hahaha so modest
 struct: nerchio destroys me in sc2 and in cg&#160;:(
 Nerchio: :grin:
 Nerchio: until you make a new submit
 Rikus: LLG, AFAIK the hashing you are doing: hash += 397 * toHashShould be: hash = (hash * 397) ^ to hash;
 Nerchio: these big leagues are kinda annoying tbh
 struct: yeah
 Nerchio: with that many participants they should probably rethink the league structure/openings
 reCurse: Good thing instead you can ba... oh nevermind.
 LLG: Rikus I made a mistake while typing those
 miszu: why big leagues are annoying? Because it takes lots of time to find your position?
 LLG: it should've beenhash = hash * 397 + toHash
 Nerchio: miszu well first of all theres a lot of matches at the start that are meaningless if you are at the top
 Nerchio: i play around 20 games i can't lose almost every time
 miszu: but but... what if it is a rare case that you could lose? :O
 Nerchio: could save some server time :p
 Rikus: gotcha LLG , still it should be XOR not ADD (IIRC, you have lower chances of collisions with XOR)
 reCurse: Nerchio: batching used to be the way to get around that, so you only batch games you're interested into to get results, but that's no longer an option
 reCurse: They limited it to the point even regular people hit the limits
 reCurse: So now you end up having to submit more to get results
 reCurse: They didn't think of coming up with an alternative&#160;:/
 reCurse: Not like they will anyway I think
 miszu: rewriting the best seed throw so it takes consideration the shadow
 struct: what is the current cooldown_
 struct: *?
 reCurse: Not publically communicated but it's pretty aggressive
 struct: I even hit it during testing
 Rikus: someone in the chat mentioned 20 matches within a 5 minute span
 reCurse: I've never seen people complain about play limits in the past 4 years of contest before
 struct: yeah I saw lots of user mentioning it
 KalamariKing: Why IS it so aggressive
 kovi: there is a controversion support moderate submit spam from 50%...and wise batch from 5%
 struct: to save servers 
 KalamariKing: Did other contests' games last as long as this one
 struct: They could have made game 50ms
 reCurse: Not sure how much good it did to servers, people still complain about submit times
 reCurse: I think they made it 100ms because they couldn't fix the random timeout problem in FC20
 struct: ah
 reCurse: Pure speculation
 ArT3MiS.w33: can we get unlimited time
 ArT3MiS.w33: plz
 LLG: Rikus I'll try XOR and see if it improves my bot, ty
 KalamariKing: That would kill the servers
 orangesnowfox: ArT3MiS.w33 what kind of "unlimited" :eyes:
 Thienu: infinite search time!
 Thienu: think of the nodes
 AntiSquid: unlimited time :D calculate until the end of the universe
 reCurse: You can get more time by optimizing
 orangesnowfox: hahaha... If I had infinite search time anywhere...... lol
 AntiSquid: can run crypto miner on top of the bot 
 orangesnowfox: lol, I was thinking more "cure for cancer miner"
 ddreams: so noble
 AntiSquid: if you get enough crypto you'll afford to do both, get your priorities straight
 orangesnowfox: lol
 ArT3MiS.w33: yoo guys chill
 ArT3MiS.w33: XD
 ddreams: cure cancer while chilling on your yacht
 orangesnowfox: eww, yacht
 KalamariKing: who decided yacht should be spelled yacht
 ddreams: the dutch apparently
 ddreams: mid 16th century: from early modern Dutch jaghte, from jaghtschip ‘fast pirate ship’, from jag(h)t ‘hunting’ + schip ‘ship’.
 AntiSquid: probably worth searching for: "yacht etymology" 
 Nanosplitter: "The term, yacht, originates from the Dutch word jacht (pl. jachten, which means "hunt"), and originally referred to light, fast sailing vessels that the Dutch Republic navy used to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries" - Wikipedia
 UndercoverToad: for me as a German that spelling looks perfectly reasonable
 UndercoverToad: I write it Jacht. But English is always different
 UndercoverToad: like address vs Adresse
 AntiSquid: the dutch? bet it had something to do with the spice wars 
 reCurse: He who controls the spice...
 UndercoverToad: i've never seen the Dune movie. But played the game for years
 reCurse: I'm pretty excited about the new one, so I'm expecting disappointment
 ddreams: You should read the book
 Violet.-.: hi
 ddreams: It's well written
 reCurse: Though the art will be amazing regardless I'm sure
 UndercoverToad: there will be a new one?
 reCurse: Yeah later this year
 Chainman: Good morning :grimacing:
 ddreams: Good evening
 Chainman: My ranking dropping so fast.
 reCurse: With Denis Villeneuve as director &lt;3
 Violet.-.: do you know a book which has gathered all commands of python?
 UndercoverToad: oh, a remaster. cool
 UndercoverToad: i was disappointed about the 3D successor
 reCurse: Oh sorry, I meant the new movie
 solistice: are there any good guides / resources on how to start a good heuristic function? all new to me
 reCurse: Not the new game
 N.HungC3KT: Heloo
 UndercoverToad: oh. and i just realized that remastered is just a user mod
 ddreams: solistice: double eval(Game &amp;g) { return g.score; }
 ddreams: go from there
 Chainman: :joy:
 reCurse: There is an actual new game UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: does it run on linux?
 reCurse: Asking the real questions
 AntiSquid: probably
 AntiSquid: what's the name&#160;? :P
 jrke: UndercoverToad are you doing beam search?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: i think we had that question already
 AntiSquid: i mean it will likely be available for steam like most games and probably have linux support . witcher 3 runs on linux smoothly for me
 reCurse: Searching for the beams of light
 jrke: with any opponet prediction?
 UndercoverToad: no
 ZarthaxX: jrke is entering panic mode
 jrke: yes i am already in panic mode
 struct: he is stuck in a  loop
 UndercoverToad: me too, running out of ideas
 jrke: me not getting good eval
 ddreams: try spinning, that's a good trick
 Chainman: I'm very dead, I need top 100 :sweat_smile:
 jrke: so just beam search with optim and eval can give a good rank?
 Chainman: But I don't think my eval with beam search will do it 
 miszu: do you consider a throw seeds if it shadows your own tree?
 reCurse: Is it FC20 that popularized beam search? Never saw that algorithm mentioned so much before.
 Chainman: Is anyone doing Reinforcement learning? lol
 reCurse: Reminds me when everyone was talking about GAs because of you-know-who
 Chainman: Also chokudai search hahah
 ZarthaxX: maybe because struct said he used beam  when cotnest started and conditioned everyone else
 AntiSquid: ah damn now i get what FC20 is, was thinking it's a private contest
 RoboStac: it was basically the best algorithm in the last 2 contests
 UndercoverToad: i think it just fits here. little opponent interaction
 Chainman: What else can you do? beam search makes sense to me. 
 reCurse: Oh it was popular in SC20 too...
 KalamariKing: Beam search is all I know /shrug
 Thienu: how does chokudai search differ from beam search? everything in google seems to be japanese
 ZarthaxX: and HS reCurse?
 ZarthaxX: well that was long ago
 RoboStac: hs was years ago, no-one cares about it anymore 
 ZarthaxX: true
 Chainman: @Thienu that is the question
 UndercoverToad: chokudai = fixed depth, increase width
 jrke: i am too much paniced:worried:
 reCurse: Yeah and even if it was mentioned, it barely stuck around
 struct: Thienu you increase beam width when you still have time
 reCurse: Now everyone is beam this and beam that
 Thienu: oh alright
 reCurse: Feels like I'm on the set of star trek
 Chainman: chokudai just uses time?
 struct: its a simple algorithm tbf
 ZarthaxX: tru
 UndercoverToad: struct can understand and implement it wrong in just 5 minutes
 reCurse: lol
 Thienu: nice
 ZarthaxX: jrke calm down lol, you wont go anywhere
 ZarthaxX: i know you are afraid of having that high rank in your contest history, but that wont help
 struct: yeah first time I  implemented it wrong
 ZarthaxX: well low rank
 struct: first time I was saving the most common action
 struct: &gt;D
 struct: damn this windows dev build so buggy
 struct: Nothing works
 reCurse: Insider?
 struct: yes
 reCurse: Well that's what it's for, beta testing
 struct: I wanted to try the wsl gui
 KalamariKing: almost like its called... a DEV build...
 UndercoverToad: gui for terminal?
 UndercoverToad: barbaric
 reCurse: When it comes to "things I like about linux", gui comes maybe dead last
 UndercoverToad: i like my i3wm
 UndercoverToad: so fast
 ddreams: I used i3wm like 15 years ago
 UndercoverToad: it's that old? :o
 reCurse: All the effort goes on the cli and it shows
 ddreams: Initial release: March 15, 2009; 12 years ago
 ddreams: not quite 15 then
 UndercoverToad: i'm using it since 2017 maybe

 cromulus: hi
 ddreams: perhaps I'm confusing it with wmii
 CameronWatt: i need to come up with a username when i code at home, for like this and github... hrmmm. 
 miszu: alright so I improved my bot quite a bit. Those throwing seeds are better now
 KalamariKing: epic
 CameronWatt: 1337cod3r42069x
 CameronWatt: hows dat
 ddreams: WattTheFatt
 miszu: wow I am beating the 1000th place
 CameronWatt: lawls
 cromulus: im not a great coder any tips
 ddreams: git good
 CameronWatt: practice
 cromulus: lol 
 cromulus: i will
 miszu: Data Structure and Algorithm, 6th edition
 CameronWatt: meh
 ddreams: Skiena is more fun
 cromulus: does this site let me publish my games
 UndercoverToad: yes if you stick to the SDK
 cromulus: cool
 Kellthazar: Did some changes on my code yesterday... Now I think that I need to implement an ¨offensive shadow cast" on my throw seed validation. XD
 CameronWatt: protip for my aspiring devs here, and then i'll take my leave - don't just accept any offer and work for any company - look for those red flags, and don't say yes to everything they ask you to do. set your boundaries and be loyal to yourself first.
 CameronWatt: cheers all afk
 UndercoverToad: that was random
 jrke: no ideas for eval&#160;;( i am very much panicedddd
 ddreams: look for those red flags, jrke
 UndercoverToad: go through a replay and analyze frame by frame
 AntiSquid: doesn't that go for any job really? CameronWatt
 UndercoverToad: what's happening? what would you want instead? why doesn't your bot do it? what to change to make it happen?
 KalamariKing: ok wtf the teacher handed me a hamburger and said "enjoy your hotdog"
 AntiSquid: i want it to lazer pew pew insta win
 dudenoah34: whay
 dudenoah34: what*
 KalamariKing: lazer trees
 dudenoah34: :expressionless:
 AntiSquid: you're level 3 you wouldn't understand dudenoah34
 dudenoah34: !rank
 AntiSquid: !kick
 KalamariKing: lmao
 dudenoah34: !rank
 KalamariKing: if at first you don't succeed; try, try again
 AntiSquid: the kick worked
 jrke: euler do you have something like not completing before X days or like that
 ZarthaxX: i think its not fair to keep asking about his eval lol
 UndercoverToad: i didn't hardcode such stuff
 AntiSquid: euler give just a bit of detail, 1 RAIC style level of detail
 UndercoverToad: when you hardcode actions in a sim-based bot, it's because you are desperate
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: ^
 ZarthaxX: so true
 itzluku: :x
 miszu: UndercoverToad you use sims?
 AntiSquid: oh guilty i guess
 UndercoverToad: yes miszu
 UndercoverToad: i'm also eulerscheZahl in case you missed it
 miszu: your username was revealing haha
 AntiSquid: split personality
 ZarthaxX: he is the bad toad here
 reCurse: Thought the point to be undercover was no one knows :thinking:
 KalamariKing: whats it like to be back at lvl 3
 miszu: it's like in league of legends the character Blitzcrank, there was a costume for: defentivly not Blitz
 geppoz: well to be undercover your icon should have toad inside, not outside :thinking:
 UndercoverToad: enough chatting, back to understanding what's going on
 CameronWatt: AntiSquid yeah it does
 AntiSquid: who does what? 
 AntiSquid: oh . found your last message 
 struct: im also going to close chat
 KalamariKing: ok have fun
 CouscousAgha: If both players cut a tree at the same round, do they get the same amount of points?And do nutrients decrease by 1 or 2?
 ddreams: yes 2
 miszu: submitting my code boys
 miszu: let's see if I can go higher than 2025 position
 aangairbender: gl
 miszu: top 1500
 miszu: going well
 Wontonimo: go miszu go
 Chainman: you beat me haha
 LLG: I accidentally typed &lt;= instead of &gt;= in my code
 LLG: and my bot actively avoid blocking my opponent
 miszu: unit testing is your friend
 LLG: instead of looking for moves that block
 miszu: unit testing is the kind of friend you don't want to be but you know deep inside he will help you go grow a better person
 ddreams: unit testing is for work
 miszu: unit testing is a way of life
 Chainman: AntiSquid beat me earlier :open_mouth:
 AntiSquid: not sure why ping, but you welcome i guess
 Chainman: nothing, cause first person I see on chat that fight me. 
 miszu: that top 1000 wall is real
 Chainman: How does the search through future states work in terms of eval.
 Chainman: I'm not sure if I should be eval(state)?eval(next_state),&#160;?=[*,+] 
 Chainman: Or just take the state that lead to the best state for the max_depth
 miszu: evaluation is the current you visit
 miszu: and your root state will chose the child state that has the best eval
 Chainman: Yeah but you are visiting future states in the graph. 
 miszu: right
 miszu: each state has its own values in the eval
 miszu: up to you if you want to use it or not
 Chainman: yeah, not sure 
 Chainman: I feel there is a level of uncertainty the deeper in the graph, so need to consider that a less deep node with lower eval is sometime better than a path that had a higher eval deeper. 
 Smelty: sigh.
 miszu: I believe it's all about the evaluation function
 Smelty: yes, 
 Smelty: i have not managed to get a good scoring function going&#160;:(
 miszu: if you have the winning recipee, you can win
 miszu: what's your position?
 Chainman: the eval&#160;:(
 Smelty: yea you gottta have a good score
 Smelty: er
 Wontonimo: 6,000 people playing, that's a good number.  
 miszu: and can't break the top 1000
 Smelty: cant break 1000 either
 Smelty: been dropping ranks lol
 Wontonimo: that's because there have been a lot of new stronger bots submitted.  don't compare one days rank to another
 Nerchio: you guys should introduce some bugs into your code
 Smelty: w-
 miszu: yeah I heard that people at the top dont' submit their best bot
 miszu: in general
 Smelty: i be confuzled
 Smelty: i put a condition numberOfSeeds&lt;2 for if you want to plant
 Smelty: but its spamming seeds even when there are already 3
 Nerchio: probably not updating number of seeds?
 Gronahak: or you just found a bug in the implementation of the language you're using :p
 KalamariKing: Print the numberOfSeeds var to the error stream right before the check, and print "inside check" or smth inside the check
 miszu: Ocams razor theorem: I am sure he has a bug
 KalamariKing: Are println's in Java expensive time-wise
 Chainman: He has found a black hole I think.
 Wontonimo: miszu, how easy it for you to make a few changes in your bots placement?
 is1c1c: if you do multiple actions per turn, you have to update your gamestate pr. action and re-evaluate the validity of all other potential actions against the new state
 KalamariKing: Also can you not grow a tree on the very first turn of the first day? Why is it not coming up in the possible_actions?
 Hasuzawa: java println is printstream, I once commented out them and the answer was in time
 miszu: Wontonimo I did a small change in my strategy and it helped me to go higher
 geppoz: KalamariKing no sun points for it
 KalamariKing: geppoz oh ok thanks, didn't see that
 Nerchio: there should be a turtle emoji added to the chat for the submit performance
 VizGhar: somebody can tell me about at least how deep should the beam search be?
 VizGhar: I believe depth of 3 is too little
 KalamariKing: Probably yeah
 Nerchio: depth 3 of days or actions
 VizGhar: actions&#160;:(
 VizGhar: so i have to prune like hell
 Nerchio: yeah it probably doesnt tell you much tbh
 VizGhar: But at least I'm 100% sure I'm generating right nodes
 VizGhar: And hardcoding even first moves is a little bit odd - always running into shadows
 VizGhar: (against best players)... so I believe even them are not hardcoding first moves
 Nerchio: i hardcoded actions not placements
 VizGhar: But still... i'm more then happy with 200positions
 VizGhar: yes Nerchio that is exactly what I wanted to do
 Nerchio: my depth says 20k processed states and depth 1 thats kinda weird
 Nerchio: bug?
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be1d2c34-0827-480d-a3ac-eaae565064c3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be1d2c34-0827-480d-a3ac-eaae565064c3</a>
 Nerchio: yeah 
 VizGhar: yes :D you cant have 20k nodes at depth 1 :D
 VizGhar: there are at most 9 actions in first day
 Nerchio: well its on day 18
 ClockSort: try to get 1 node at degth 20k
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio do you go depth by days?
 ZarthaxX: im curious about this
 Nerchio: depth is 1 action
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: maybe you were doing depth in terms of days
 ZarthaxX: nvm haha
 VizGhar: Interesting idea... but too late :D
 ZarthaxX: what?
 ZarthaxX: depth in days?
 VizGhar: yes
 ZarthaxX: you have half contest yet
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 KalamariKing: Anyone have any resources on dealing with bitboardsOr would anyone like to give a quick rundown
 VizGhar: I'm rank 200. my target was top 500, so Im more than happy
 Chainman: wow, 
 VizGhar: bitboards? what is the problem? you know bitwise operators right?
 KalamariKing: Yeah, but how do you extract specific positions
 ClockSort: it's not over yet, VizGhar :D
 Scarfield: KalamariKing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf">https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf</a>
 KalamariKing: Thanks
 VizGhar: For example, these are all trees, that are mine, non dormant and of size 2:gameTurn.size2Trees &amp; gameTurn.myTrees &amp; ~gameTurn.dormantTrees
 Chainman: That a cool resource
 Chainman: I'm super stuck on understanding how to search through the states&#160;:(
 Scarfield: that minus looking tilde :rage:
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: new sub improved ranking by 100
 Smelty: its still fighting through though
 Nerchio: ah ok that 20k states depth 1 was a bug in printing
 Smelty: o.O
 Chainman: do I Need to store the sequence of all states along each path in my beam search?
 Chainman: I can't think of another way, because you need to know the initial action that lead to the best path. 
 Nerchio: you dont need to remember the path
 Nerchio: first move is enough
 Chainman: oh yeah, oops
 Chainman: I'm just freaking out over everything.  I'm not going based off any definitive guides. 
 VizGhar: Chainman keep the whole list of actions... easier to debug
 VizGhar: remove it later
 Nerchio: that is also not a bad idea
 VizGhar: I can see that my bot wants to do GROW 19 - COMPLETE 8 - WAITAnd suddenly I know why he picked that path
 KalamariKing: why
 VizGhar: that was example
 Chainman: oh cool, thx
 KalamariKing: right
 KalamariKing: but why
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: it's an open ended story KalamariKing, the hero's journey continues
 Nerchio: but why :rage:
 VizGhar: Automaton2000 -&gt; job for you
 Automaton2000: how do you get a second opinion
 VizGhar: mg he is against me
 Chainman: big questions
 UndercoverToad: then write it BIG
 Poostang: moves.get((int)(Math.random()*moves.size()))
 Poostang: top of bronze
 struct: rand()&#160;% actions.size() 300 silver
 Nerchio: lol
 Poostang: mod wins
 VizGhar: wth... like for real Poostang?
 AntiSquid: i'd sell struct for 3 silver, since jesus was sold for 30
 Chainman: :hushed:
 Nerchio: :joy:
 struct: should 10k games be enough to test sim?
 VizGhar: what do you think struct? :D
 jrke: 10k thats huge according to me
 AntiSquid: just submit first change to arena yolo
 Marchete: how do you test that fast?
 Marchete: I'm going with CG IDE
 struct: locally vs my own version
 Marchete: and it's dead slow
 VizGhar: brutaltester probably
 AntiSquid: inbreeding bots
 Nerchio: i can play 100 games per 10 minutes only
 struct: yes
 Marchete: probably I'll setup brutaltester
 struct: well testing sim is fast
 Marchete: so far the sun calc and movegen is going good
 struct: its like 4 games per sec
 struct: on 4 threads
 Marchete: I need to apply moves and check that it's similar
 Marchete: I don't test sim locally, I prefer against servers
 Marchete: or brutaltester
 struct: im using brutaltester
 Marchete: but I don't trust my code&#160;:)
 jrke: how to test?
 Marchete: ahh then yes
 struct: custom referee though
 struct: I can have both referee and my code wrong 
 Marchete: lel
 ddreams: why not change to the official one?
 Marchete: zenoscave did the referee, isn't it?
 struct: im not using zeno
 struct: Im using the one I made during testing
 Marchete: P0 READING DAY:17 TURN:43 SUN:3 1 CALCULATE SUN!!!  COUNT:13 9
 Marchete: P0 READING DAY:18 TURN:44 SUN:13 9
 Marchete: I'm happy
 Marchete: btw exporting gamestate with C# is very simple for me
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1e65514-8271-4f3b-b3be-75cddc94fe13">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1e65514-8271-4f3b-b3be-75cddc94fe13</a>
 MSmits: Dear diary, the sun was out today, but that bully from across the field put his trees in my face...
 Marchete: :evergreen_tree::seedling:
 dmar: hi
 Marchete: :sunny:
 MSmits: you can put emotes in your messages
 jrke: from 3 days i am searching for an average eval and still failing&#160;:(
 MSmits: from your bot
 jacek: try maximum eval
 MSmits: not sure how but it's possible
 dmar: :sunglasses:
 Marchete: yes it's possible
 MSmits: jrke same
 jrke: maybe eval is not the issue maybe my sim has bug
 Marchete: it always was
 ddreams: output the right unicode symbol probably
 MSmits: jrke my sim doesnt have bug, because i verified. But still have eval problems
 Marchete: you can even animate some
 Marchete: like the moon
 jrke: how you verified MS
 reCurse: Output is UTF-8 MSmits, you can print whatever in there.
 MSmits: i pick an action with search, generate all opponent actions, then apply them to create all possible next game states. I save the list. Then on next turn i compare the new state, with the list and see if it's there
 MSmits: it's always there
 MSmits: ah nice reCurse
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: the tricky part is to only compare when you havent waited
 MSmits: and when you have waited and opponent has waited, you can verfiy the sun point calc
 Marchete: it seems you are somehow struggling with this game, smits
 Marchete: or it's the normal way?
 darkhorse64: wait acts a sync and you should only compare states in sync. 
 Marchete: I'm not on challenges usually
 MSmits: no I am struggling
 struct: eval its a bit hard to figure
 darkhorse64: *as a*
 struct: is*
 MSmits: usually when my first full search is done, i'll hit top 10, then dropping later
 struct: I spent 3 days until I found this eval
 MSmits: i even was nr 1 with pacman for like a few hrs
 dmar: yo join my dicord
 MSmits: ended 50 or so
 dmar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/er3QgE3x">https://discord.gg/er3QgE3x</a>
 jrke: did eval is based on day?
 Marchete: I don't have this problem, I was never that high
 MSmits: right now i am ranked 900 though 
 BlitzProg: MSmits I'm top 100 with no sim and there are more people like me being like top 20
 MSmits: i know
 jacek: apparently only in holland you can get that high
 reCurse: It's like the saying goes, 1st on wednesday, 50th on last day.
 MSmits: heuristics work fine here
 BlitzProg: heuristic is being unusually strong here
 miszu: yeah, who has the best secret sauce
 reCurse: Isn't that what people wanted since forever lol
 MSmits: i am ok with heuristics, usually a search can do what heuristics can do, the search part is mostly a waste of time then
 Marchete:  szechuan dipping sauce
 UndercoverToad: i don't like your saying reCurse
 Marchete: reBless :rofl:
 reCurse: But that's how it goes
 UndercoverToad: i know&#160;:(
 reCurse: I'm even being optimistic
 reCurse: Level ramps up like crazy last weekend usually
 struct: im already testing next one
 MSmits: well it's a bit different these days with the larger participation
 UndercoverToad: i liked the time when the contest ended on Saturday already
 struct: statement mentions that only if else is allowed
 Scarfield: lol
 UndercoverToad: is it an escape room?
 struct: only if you find the way out
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: otherwise it's a prison
 Ziink: MSmits it's my first time, how's the participation usually&#160;?
 reCurse: Judging by this chat it's time to do a bitboard stream
 MSmits: for the last year it's been high 5k+
 struct: You wont
 MSmits: 2 years before that, around 2k
 AntiSquid: if it were a fun game sure heuristics would be fun @_@
 jacek: it seems the rarer, the more
 reCurse: Yeah so according to priorities
 UndercoverToad: or they do more promotion
 reCurse: They should fall to once per year next
 kovi: heurstic is always fun...for a while
 MSmits: covid boosts participation too
 kovi: heuristics
 reCurse: And then the logical conclusion is to never do them again and gain infinity people next time
 AntiSquid: only 1 contest per year&#160;?
 reCurse: That kind of engagement makes my head spin
 jacek: so covid is CG conspiracy to boost contest participation
 MSmits: sure
 Enknable: recurse just stream all your knowledge
 MSmits: seems as likely as the other conspiracies&#160;:)
 Enknable: :pray:
 struct: if he streams I subscribe
 UndercoverToad: bring some time with you Enknable
 Astrobytes: 0 contests = infinite participants.Mind blown. Now THAT'S strategy!
 AntiSquid: well if they properly bureaucratised internally i am sure 1 contest a year is very likely
 reCurse: If I kept my mouth shut I'd be promoted straight to marketing director
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: you mean to keep your mouth shut? I am wondering about cause and effect here :P
 AntiSquid: you can still get a t-shirt for your suggestion iam sure
 reCurse: I am also willing to keep my mouth shut for the right price
 AntiSquid: ooc and pacman were back to back though 
 AntiSquid: and ooc really burnt me out 
 Astrobytes: $10 and a year's free poutine. Final offer.
 AntiSquid: 1 donut / day
 miszu: poutine is good. La poulle mouille restaurant is da best
 reCurse: You just used a stereotype, you're getting canceled next
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: more a case of cultural apropriation
 Astrobytes: Hey, the grabbing the moose by the antlers thing was getting old.
 reCurse: That's animal abuse now
 Astrobytes: Hah! You're on form today :D
 reCurse: Not even lol
 reCurse: Allergies are killing me
 AntiSquid: i swear there was something like a "warning for vegans&#160;: animal cruelty " on one netflix movie
 Scarfield: they were eating meat
 Astrobytes: Ah allergies suck. I consider myself lucky I don't suffer with any.
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: i have hayfever which can be pretty annoying. but meat allergy would be the worst
 Astrobytes: I wasn't referring to meat...
 Lucky30_: reCurse please share your knowledge, i am a big fan, and i will watch it all 
 Scarfield: oh, didnt see reBless' comment xD thought you were joking on the vegan warning
 Astrobytes: Though I did know someone who is allergic to red mullet.
 MSmits: haven't eaten meat since march myself. I don't have a problem with meat, but animal cruelty is pretty bad in most places
 AntiSquid: meat meat allergy? or shellfish / fish kind of stuff&#160;?
 Astrobytes: *do know
 AntiSquid: i only heard some people having some rare condition problems with digesting meat prorperly so they avoid it
 AntiSquid: hearsay 
 Scarfield: both would be sad
 Bogdan._.: hello
 reCurse: All food allergies suck tbh, truly the worst
 AntiSquid: 2 pages of food allergies listed is worst i've seen
 reCurse:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: My nephew (few months old) and niece (just over a year old) are violently lactose intolerant. The nephew is worst, he has breathing difficulties and skin rashes. 
 Bogdan._.: I am don't have allergies to food
 MSmits: that doesnt sound like lactose intolerance, thats a milk allergy i think
 AntiSquid: not joking, someone was recovering from food poisoning and they were recommended to avoid certain stuff and slowly introduce it into their diet
 Astrobytes: No, both technically MSmits, since you mention it. Not just milk, anything with lactose.
 MSmits: but thats weird, lactose doesn't actually enter your system does it? It gets broken up by bacteria, which causes the intestinal gas issues
 MSmits: because you lack lactase, the enzym to break it up yourself
 Astrobytes: The milk allergy itself is what causes the breathing difficulties/rash
 MSmits: ah yes
 reCurse: Yeah when you lack those, it happens
 MSmits: thats what i meant
 reCurse: I'm not even sorry
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: it's ok reCurse, i would have made the same joke :P
 Astrobytes: And it's not just gas MSmits
 ddreams: So you could be lactose tolerant and have a milk allergy, I guess
 MSmits: i know
 Astrobytes: Yes, though they're most often found together afaik ddreams
 MSmits: personally i am just intolerant. Spanish ancestry I think
 MSmits: lactose intoleramt
 Scarfield: im just intolerant in general
 Astrobytes: I thought you just meant intolerant.
 MSmits: yeah i know, thats why i added that :p
 AntiSquid: diary allergy
 jrke: i am gonna beat my laptop can't get eval :sob:
 MSmits: dont read diaries then
 AntiSquid: dairy * lol
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcUs5X9glCc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcUs5X9glCc</a>
 MSmits: as non-native English speaker I love messing with natives :P
 Chainman: eval is destroying me
 MSmits: and again that came out wrong
 reCurse: Oh boy.
 reCurse: We're headed straight into webchat removal.
 Astrobytes: wtf MSmits
 reCurse: So keep going guys
 Hoyer: will the map size ever change?
 MSmits: lol...
 Hoyer: no, right?
 ddreams: only if you play a different game
 Hoyer: I'm thinking like at later leagues
 Astrobytes: No Hoyer. 
 Westicles: logjam at the top, better add a new rule
 Hoyer: alright thanks
 AntiSquid: i feel unsafe when MSmits is in chat, maybe he should be banned&#160;? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how do you like challenges?
 Chainman: Who is Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i got a clash of code a la mode
 MSmits: come on, you code c++, you can take unsafe
 Chainman: lol 
 AntiSquid: not going down that road MSmits
 cegprakash: omg silver is super competitive
 Astrobytes: wth did you expect?
 cegprakash: top 200 okay
 cegprakash: but top 1000 are too strong
 MSmits: time to dust off the ol' prune array?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jrke: man man man in 3 days i can't get a eval 
 cegprakash: jrke new ppl are dominating in India
 ddreams: keep praying
 cegprakash: may be we are missing something intuitive
 cegprakash: jrke there should be some greedy approach we are missing
 jrke: till i get a better eval ceg
 cegprakash: I'll tell u a simple eval
 cegprakash: this should take to top 1000 start from there and tweak it
 cromulus: can I code a game and make money off it on this site
 Astrobytes: No.
 cegprakash: cromulus no.. but u can use this skills to implement AI for real world problems where u work and earn money
 cegprakash: this is for helping u grow the skills and to have fun as a community cromulus
 cegprakash: just like gaming
 cromulus: okay thanks
 Chainman: This is a fun way to learn. 
 cromulus: yeh
 cegprakash: but there are some crazy rewards if u finish in top 20
 AntiSquid: cromulus lol
 cegprakash: huawei stuff and t shirts from codingame cromulus
 Chainman: :unamused:
 AntiSquid: well technically it depends . if you sream onyoutube how you make the game you prolly get paid for the ads so ...
 Chainman: I'll be ecstatic in top 100
 Chainman: But that's unlikely at this point. 
 JP7: All right, I've been clash of coding for 4 days
 JP7: finally coming back to competition
 KalamariKing: lol gl
 JP7: presently rank 2.6k
 JP7: how many ranks do we think I can climb today
 KalamariKing: in the comp? or in coc?
 JP7: Comp
 KalamariKing: jesus
 KalamariKing: I've been at this all day and I'm still in 3k
 JP7: oof, whats your current general strat?
 JP7: My bot currently just tries to always have a tree/seed of all sizes on the board at all times, and then "completes" asap. Incredibly basic thing that has to be rewritten entirely to go up farther lol
 Nerchio: sounds pretty good
 KalamariKing: JP7 rn? I have yet to implement any new rules from the bronze category, so that's probably whyAnd there's no searching future moves or anything
 JP7: Ah, you've got plenty of room to grow then, not to worry
 KalamariKing: Right
 KalamariKing: But
 KalamariKing: I've never done any of this before and its taken me 5 days to get where I'm at now
 KalamariKing: I doubt I'll get out of bronze
 Nerchio: you can do it&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: Btw why are clashes so easy
 MSmits: you have to solve them in 15 mins is why
 KalamariKing: Like I'm relatively slow at coding and I'm 372nd, got as high as like 220th before
 aCat: hi Smits&#160;:-)
 aCat: how's your player&#160;?
 MSmits: my bot? It performs badly, i like the sim and such though
 Astrobytes: What about you aCat?
 aCat: just finished engine
 aCat: got some work-related stuff before
 aCat: i made it low level
 Astrobytes: Ah cool.
 aCat: and still got only 180k states
 aCat: ndea how to do better
 aCat: but doesnt matter
 Astrobytes: Sounds useable. What approach are you taking search-wise?
 aCat: now I got flat monte carlo
 UndercoverToad: i'm way below your 180k
 aCat: and wish to somehow get to silver before writing any 'normal' algorithm
 aCat: ah toad
 Astrobytes: There are simple heuristics to get to silver.
 MSmits: to get to top 100 i bet
 aCat: I wanted to thank you very much for our talk before
 aCat: I really learned a lot
 UndercoverToad: you're welcome
 aCat: (but my 180k are no eval, just search)
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Yes indeed.
 UndercoverToad: my eval is expensive
 aCat: I'm still thinking what algo to approach
 aCat: beam is nice, but we need opponent prediction
 aangairbender: I gave up on sim/search, might be a bug somewhere idk, its just bad
 UndercoverToad: i think a proper prediction can make the difference and win the contest
 aCat: but your bot seems to work great euler
 aangairbender: how beam search makes bot completing trees in the middle of the game? smart eval?
 MSmits: yeah thats difficult
 MSmits: if you value score points too much, it just starts popping them
 UndercoverToad: there are still some days to go. and watching replays I see non-optimal actions that I can explain by lack of opponent handling
 dbdr: well, your BS can see that completing them later leads to more points than completing them now
 cegprakash: Rank 300 - 49.3Rank 700 44.67
 UndercoverToad: you have to synchronize your beam. wait until all paths have finished the current day before starting the next
 aCat: I'm always thinking watching replies why no early trees on the middle
 UndercoverToad: my main problem is that I plan to spend the suns in future turns. and a bad move that gives more early reward (which I won't get, opponent will block me) causes me to play the bad move
 aCat: even if it seems as a better position
 struct: maybe Ill add that to my beam
 struct: Currently I dont care if one is at turn 2 and other at turn 4
 UndercoverToad: add what? early middle tree?
 UndercoverToad: oh
 UndercoverToad: i'm surprised your beam is working then. mine played total garbage without sync
 aangairbender: what you mean by sync?
 UndercoverToad: go 5 messages above
 TobiasA: my bot times out at depth of 2:cry:
 struct: do not allow states of different depth to be in queue
 struct: turn* not depth
 aangairbender: mine is fine then
 MSmits: do you guys eval at end of day or at every action?
 MSmits: I am currently doing eval after every action
 struct: every action
 MSmits: thought so
 MSmits: i mean i guess you'll branch too much if you wait till end of day
 aangairbender: I tried both
 TobiasA: ooooh you are right
 TobiasA: i am waiting till end of day thats why
 TobiasA: ha hoi hoi ha he 
 AntiSquid: yay of course bot doesn't lose the game again in the IDE
 TobiasA: if this doesn't work it is back to depression for me
 aCat: ah so the beam holds not-finished days, and explore all the other statesto finally synchronize when the day is ended for all
 aCat: I'll have to consider this somehow
 MSmits: it's quite easy, just duplicate wait states (give them 1 child, an identical state)
 MSmits: every depth level, check if any new states are not wait, if so keep going, otherwise end day
 BrunoFelthes: MSmits what kind of search are you using?
 aCat: ouh nice idea workaround
 MSmits: beamsearch, same as euler, but without his eval. Not having much luck
 MSmits: best rank i get now is about 700
 AntiSquid: 600
 aCat: anyone is trying some really multiplayer approach??
 aCat: seems like no;/
 AntiSquid: well i was 1st on bronze open briefly, so i guess i can still retire gracefully from contest :P
 BrunoFelthes: but, how do you deal with the score in different days? I mean, if i score 10 actions, the 10h action can be 2 or 3 days after, so the action that did 3 days is better than the actions with 2...
 MSmits: all days are the same
 MSmits: every state is at day 1, then every state is at day, etc.
 MSmits: days are synchronized
 MSmits: states that wait, keep waiting till all states are done
 MSmits: then it's a new day
 BrunoFelthes: so, your bean stack is by day?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: by action
 reCurse: bean stack :D
 MSmits: i just let wait states, wait again
 dbdr: *lurker detected*&#160;;)
 BrunoFelthes: oh, i see...
 reCurse: How? You have no vision, map hacker
 AntiSquid: giant bean stack best way to win this
 BrunoFelthes: how do you know how many plays 1 day can have?
 MSmits: I know when all states are waitinh
 MSmits: then the day is done
 MSmits: sometimes that is 4 actions, sometimes 5
 MSmits: so in some cases, the state just waits 5 times
 MSmits: while another state is doing a bunch of things
 JP7: Is there a setup guide for running games locally?
 BrunoFelthes: Anyone are doing MCTS? I think that i will try it...
 JP7: I've got the local webserver running, but am experiencing errors (and also don't know how to specify the code for each bot to use)
 BrunoFelthes: MSmits, are you think that MCTS can be better than beamsearch for turn 15 to 25?
 MSmits: like, a single player mcts, or both players?
 BrunoFelthes: both
 MSmits: and i assume you mean day 15 to 25?
 MSmits: or actually 24?
 BrunoFelthes: yeah, day 15
 CharmyRosewolf: I want to try an mct--would be a good opportunity to learn some data structures XD
 MSmits: it might work for the end of the game yes
 MSmits: but mcts is not really simultaneous
 MSmits: in its basic form
 BrunoFelthes: But, do you think that it is too important?
 MSmits: well it is somewhat
 MSmits: you'll have two players reacting to eachothers moves, when they cant, due to simultaneity
 Cleingoun: ah short question im doing the onboarding for dart and the example code gives errors?
 reCurse: What about prescience
 reCurse: Or maybe even spectre attack
 MSmits: mmh try it with the smurf reCurse and get back to us&#160;:)
 BrunoFelthes: I'm planning to do the oponent play for the day, and than my play, so, somehow, i'm reacting it...
 MSmits: well then mcts might work, not sure
 reCurse: What smurf
 MSmits: the one we're not supposed to know about
 ClockSort: :D
 reCurse: You see smurfs everywhere, maybe you need to calm down with the recreational drugs
 MSmits: i'm just kidding, I dont think you actually have a smurf this time
 MSmits: emphasis on think
 BrunoFelthes: reCurse is not doing this contest?
 MSmits: well not on this account for sure
 reCurse: I just would chop down all the trees anyway
 reCurse: Less trees less pollen
 Astrobytes: Lumberjack you say...
 MSmits: ye Scarfield appreciates
 Wontonimo: anyone know the config for Zenoscave's brutaltester ref so that it uses bronze rules?
 Astrobytes: -3vel
 Chainman: I'm overcomplicating, still writing my graph algorithm and I'm at 700 lines of code in python&#160;:(
 RoboStac: probably -Dleague.level 3 before the -jar 
 RoboStac: assuming it's the same as others
 particleflux: uh oh, so it defaults to wood rules?
 particleflux: don't have that one either, but good to know, need to check, that might explain some non-matching results
 Wontonimo: Much thanks RoboStac&#160;!  that did it
 Astrobytes: Admit it. It was -3vel.
 CouscousAgha: i feel like top 400 silver things become luck based
 Clagus: where can I find a schedule for gold/legend?
 CouscousAgha: click on the league icon next to the timer of the event
 Astrobytes: Click the silver league icon
 miszu: how many people will move to gold?
 Clagus: oh, thx guys
 UndercoverToad: we can only guess. I go with 300
 <b>**Astrobytes gets out the crystal ball</b></p><p><img src="/a/2694632338638" /> Clagus: League opening: 5/12/21 (wtf british numbering??)
 RoboStac: don't blame that on us
 UndercoverToad: 5 years on CG. And I still have to think twice when I see these dates
 Astrobytes: Eh? We dodd/mm/yyyy
 miszu: oy' mate in that great inn it?
 Astrobytes: *do
 schachmatt: that's not british numbering
 CouscousAgha: isnt it common sense to do dd/dd/yyyy&#160;?
 Wontonimo: we use dd/mm/yy because we have ss:mm:hh on our clocks ... wait ... 
 Wontonimo: we use dd/mm/yy because we have ss&#160;: mm&#160;: hh on our clocks ... wait ... 
 schachmatt: british would be 12/5/21
 JP7: dd/dd&#160;!? :P
 CouscousAgha: dd/mm*
 JP7: I think so, yes
 Astrobytes: Yes, we do dd/mm/yyyy
 reCurse: Just weird it doesn't use locale, or isn't that a thing in javascript
 particleflux: mm/dd is just plain confusing
 particleflux: Should use ISO date and be done with it
 Clagus: how so? it is british/usa no? but CG is France based so I would expect EU standards  :P
 Clagus: but anyway it starts at midnight?
 Astrobytes: True reCurse. And lol, surely must be.
 Astrobytes: Clagus: UK does not use the same as the US
 reCurse: Anyway, estimated ETA for gold is 22 hours, legend is 22+48.
 JP7: 'toLocaleDateString()' seems to be what we want
 Astrobytes: For want of a better example, 9/11 for us is 11/9
 RoboStac: it's weird that it doesn't do locale or french standard
 JP7: which, yes, is js builtin
 Astrobytes: Most (all?) of Europe use dd/mm/yyyy no?
 Clagus: @Astrobytes - who is us? I thought it is both UK and USA which use the terrible month/day/year format
 is1c1c: yyyy/mm/dd is superior fight me
 Astrobytes: Clagus: USA = US. I'm UK and we do not use the USA system.
 schachmatt: @Clagus nope, we (UK) use the one that makes sense
 Clagus: oh, that's nice to hear, sorry then
 JP7: @is1c1c use that if talking to computers. Humans already have the context to know the year, and the day is more immediately relevant
 Clagus: still you use gallons, and other bullshit right? :D
 reCurse: "we use the one that makes sense" says the country driving in the left lane
 Astrobytes: Yeah, only in some ways
 JohnTravoltage: Is the source code for the Spring Challenge logic available somewhere? Or would I have to reverse-engineer if I want to make my own simulator?
 Clagus: @JP7 - exactly!
 schachmatt: I never said we consistently make sense :laughing:
 Astrobytes: We have a strange mixture of Imperial and metric measurements
 reCurse:&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: JohnTravoltage the code is even linked in the statement
 Clagus: :D
 miszu: there is the correct measurement and the US measurement
 Astrobytes: Full metric would be a real blessing.
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 JohnTravoltage: UndercoverToad Thank you! I tried to look for it but just couldn't find it anywhere&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: It's linked in 'Technical Details', just before the 'Game Protocol' section near the bottom of the statement.
 UndercoverToad: not sure if the link even shows up before Bronze
 miszu: qq about bots being used for promotion. If everyone simply submit random bots until legendary league opens, does it mean everyone could get there assuming their code is better than random moves?
 Astrobytes: Hm, should be there from the start imo Toad
 UndercoverToad: in theory: probably. but won't happen, we want to compete for real
 struct: I didnt test that
 UndercoverToad: right, the link is always there <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/config/statement_en.html.tpl#L627">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/config/statement_en.html.tpl#L627</a>
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure there's a situation in a contest where that could happen. 
 Lowz: For the challenge, how does one do multiple actions on the same turn? To they just get appended to string? Like "GROW 0 COMPLETE 23"
 UndercoverToad: thousands of players. you can't get all of them to not playing until legend
 UndercoverToad: it's in my interest to have a small legend even
 JP7: @Lowz each iteration of the loop is a new turn
 KelvinAndHubbles: you can do one action per turn, multiple per day ^^^^^^^ above is accurate
 JP7: not a new day
 UndercoverToad: turn&#160;!= day
 Lowz: Ok thanks! 
 miszu: i guess les competition once you reach legends
 UndercoverToad: there are more relevant games in legend
 UndercoverToad: right now i have almost always have a perfect winrate for the first 30 matches
 UndercoverToad: that's annoying
 struct: not 100%?
 UndercoverToad: current submit: 36 games played, all wins
 struct: Just do what my bot did
 UndercoverToad: i want to start losing to see what i'm doing wrong
 UndercoverToad: 37% completed and still waiting for some action
 UndercoverToad: but the game is less random than I expected. I'm consistently beating lower ranks
 UndercoverToad: i've seen games where you have random lesses vs a bot in the 100s
 ClockSort: nice humblebrag
 ClockSort: i do like the low randomness here
 reCurse: You're right, FC20 was much better when you could randomly lose to bots ranked 100 below
 ClockSort: the ability to approach perfection with a good bot
 reCurse: Fun times
 UndercoverToad: the consistency is good
 UndercoverToad: the huge silver isn't
 reCurse: The only reason it's a problem now is because they crippled batching tbh
 reCurse: They should have come up with an alternative first
 KelvinAndHubbles: is there more people in Silver than there is in bronze right now?  Seems wacked
 reCurse: That's par on course
 Astrobytes: That solution, imo, is a complete fail.
 reCurse: Gold is when it starts getting tighter
 <b>**UndercoverToad never used online batches</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: Yeah, but it's the fact it can affect you just doing stuff in the IDE
 Eglerion: Is there a way to view the game rules in a standalone tab, without being on the IDE page?
 reCurse: Not as far as I know
 UndercoverToad: depends on your way of analyzing
 reCurse: Maybe you can print the frame to PDF if you're lucky
 Astrobytes: screenshot it?
 struct: if you setup localy and go to localhost:8888/statement.html
 UndercoverToad: if you go through the games frame by frame it's not a problem. but illedan managed to play a lot of games manually last contest
 is1c1c: so what are ppl doing for their bots? im not rly an ai guy, so im in like low silver with some silly fuzzy logic bot
 UndercoverToad: so many that he got contacted by thibaud who wanted to find reasonable constraints to lock out CG Benchmark but not humans
 reCurse: Wait whaaaaat
 UndercoverToad: he was &gt; 1000 manual games last contest
 reCurse: That's news to me
 struct: wtf
 struct: 1000 manual games?
 Astrobytes: me too
 schachmatt: manual games?
 UndercoverToad: you also got a Thibaud?
 reCurse: I never heard of a specific intention to lock out CGBenchmark
 AntiSquid: what just pressing play my code in ide&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, I was metoo'ing at reCurse's 'news to me'
 reCurse: Only to alleviate server load
 reCurse: Now I'm kind of upset
 JP7: @Eglerion, I gotchu <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.jpcode.dev/temp/cg_spring_2021_bronze_info.html">https://static.jpcode.dev/temp/cg_spring_2021_bronze_info.html</a>
 UndercoverToad: locking out CG Bench is my interpretation, sorry
 reCurse: Ah ok
 Astrobytes: These constraints are unreasonable in any case as they lock out human players
 UndercoverToad: but thibaud asked if illedan was playing manually to get there numbers
 UndercoverToad: these*
 EtherFrog: man, clashing in java is painfull
 JP7: Yeah, its very verbose
 Astrobytes: Clashing is painful. Choose your battles.
 JP7: "Shortest" mode is effectively unplayable
 TobiasA: i don't know what to do anymore my bot is a genius at first then as more trees appear it then causes it to time out even though it is set to depth of 2:cry:
 Astrobytes: genius++ 
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA timeout may be caused by indexing wrong too
 ZarthaxX: check it locally
 AntiSquid: why don't we all just play fun clashes together? best buddies for life
 EtherFrog: yeah the only people i beat in shortest are those that don't golf their code at all, and even then python might still be shorter
 reCurse: No.
 miszu: lack of unit testing could be an issue too
 ZarthaxX: tru
 Astrobytes: TrufaxX
 AntiSquid: i like to clash while i'm trimming my nails EtherFrog, what's your fav time to clash&#160;?
 TobiasA: i don't know how to get inputs from the site
 ZarthaxX: Falbytes
 ZarthaxX: e.e
 reCurse: Serious question, did anyone in the top100 ever used unit testing in their code?
 EtherFrog: dunno i started today
 fvla: unit testing sounds like something you'd do if you can program really fast and generically
 UndercoverToad: i can answer the unit test question with "no"
 UndercoverToad: i know that others are doing it. like nmahoud e and also Royale I think
 AntiSquid: what unit testing? like a script&#160;? or create some unit tests by hand&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: player one as well (but he's not top100)
 miszu: I reached legends in UTTT because of that. I was able to find the smallest suddle bug in my sims
 Astrobytes: either or presumably AntiSquid
 UndercoverToad: use turn input to convert to a testcase
 UndercoverToad: expected action for obvious cases. or just verifying sim results
 JP7: @miszu 'subtle' english is weird
 miszu: yeah subtle thanks
 kovi: as euler said, board conversion/generation sanity checks
 Astrobytes: I will state that 'suddle bug' sounds nicer than 'subtle bug'&#160;:)
 miszu:&#160;:)
 fvla: is there a more inconsistent language than English?
 Astrobytes: French?
 fvla: haven't learned enough French to know
 Astrobytes: Probably about the same. Maybe English is worse.
 _Royale: UndercoverToad: I usually reproduce the board generation to compare games in the IDE with my local referee.
 AntiSquid: you could google it fvla
 UndercoverToad: thanks for confirming Royale (did I ping you?)
 UndercoverToad: you wrote something like that in your caribbean post mortem
 fvla: Google does give interesting results
 reCurse: I'd say it probably falls more under automated testing than unit testing, but still
 _Royale: UndercoverToad: I kept a highlight on my old nick&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: why do you ask about unit testing?
 Kellthazar: currently my "should be completed" condition is: qtd_size_3 &gt; 4 || day &gt; 20 || react_to_opp_complete... Any other suggestion? :D
 reCurse: I don't know, I saw miszu mention it several times and it made me wonder
 UndercoverToad: to plan his next stream
 reCurse: I didn't think anyone seriously competing would bother with those
 Astrobytes: :D
 _Royale: reCurse: yeah it just saved me from "clever" optimizations that completely broke my simulations&#160;:)
 reCurse: But that kind of automatic testing though, sure.
 miszu: the reason I mention is many people complain there is a bug in their sims. I figure to mention it as it will save time
 reCurse: I've done it for physics game, just wouldn't really count as unit testing, formally.
 RoboStac: yeah, the most testing I do is finding a way to test sim against the server (either by checking results in game or downloading replays)
 RoboStac: but never anything specifically testing small parts
 reCurse: Fun to know I'm far from the only one doing that part then&#160;:)
 miszu: especially when I was bitboarding UTTT with many lookup tables, I wanted to make sure all the logics handling that is tested properly so I can shift my foccus on something else
 miszu: I don't know, I like to go sleep knowing that my core functionality is fool proof (almost)
 AntiSquid: idk, how do i check timeouts i generate lots of moves check time frequently try to brea at 20ms left and still timeout occasionally @_@  how do you unit test that? lol
 miszu: which language?
 reCurse: Not a unit test but you could keep expected metrics and break when they're breached
 VizGhar: if (aboutToCrash) dont();
 reCurse: We often do that in CI, monitor performance of builds and emit alerts when there's regression of performance according to expectation
 struct: ASSERT() is the only test I need
 geppoz: +1
 miszu: assert is good too
 geppoz: just fighting with: Answer: /tmp/Answer.cpp:237: void game::doSeed1(int, int): Assertion `sp2==parent-&gt;sp2' failed.
 geppoz: when refunding doesn't match with parent sunpoints :D
 miszu: AntiSquid I had that issue before with UTTT. Issue was I did a mistake in one of the function in the MCTS algorithm... When I wrote my tests it showed me exactly where it failed
 miszu:&#160;:)
 jacek: the 'tests'?
 miszu: am I the only weirdo who does unit testing?
 _Royale: UndercoverToad: oh I just realized who you are behind this nick&#160;:) Did you get too many PM/highlights?
 jacek: oO
 reCurse: miszu: I was mostly doubting on the part of what it gives for the time put into it in a competition setting.
 reCurse: You need to be very time efficient in those contests
 dbf: miszu, I done some unit tests earlier, but I agree it is easier to cactch sim issues if you compare sim results with next step input
 UndercoverToad: chat gets laggy with many users online, mods can see all of them
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/BmQQwpa">https://imgur.com/a/BmQQwpa</a>spot the scrollbar
 reCurse: I don't consider comparing simulation output to referee output as unit testing
 _Royale: Oh I see. I was about to suggest next contest should be named Code UndercoverToad.
 reCurse: I think he has suffered enough with automaton.
 ClockSort: I spent all weekend in 3000th place because I was indexing out of bounds in my array of map shade. Thanks, C++. A test might have helped&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: Automaton is finally dead
 miszu: reCurse: you never had a scenario where you spend hours of debugging that turned out a stupid + or - sign or = &lt;= sign?
 reCurse: Protip: use your own array wrapper and assert on bad index.
 reCurse: Sure, but that would require me knowing in advance what to test for
 miszu: well if you do TDD, then as you code evertything is kinda tested. So the moment you start going crazy stuff well you can check everything in a single click
 reCurse: That's a massive time investment
 reCurse: Meanwhile you lose 100 ranks
 ClockSort: I prefer to spend my time arguing about how TDD takes too much time
 reCurse: Automatic comparison with referee output is very cheap and does a lot of the same job.
 miszu: I was doing UTTT aiming for legends, however I had many small bugs and couldn't figure out. My AI was picking the wrong move out of sudden. So I took one day to fool proof my engine and sims and found out 3 small bugs
 UndercoverToad: you didn't check for vertical lines at first
 ClockSort: what is "automatic comparison" @recurse
 reCurse: If you have map generation code matching the referee
 reCurse: You can take the seed
 reCurse: The sequence of inputs of each player
 miszu: I work in a company where ppl do 0 testing. Like code is so garbage that I prefer to throw a brick into a PC than do some fixing. I did proper TDD and people noticed how big quality difference I give vs the garbage code
 reCurse: And make sure your simulation gives the same result as referee
 reCurse: That's automatic
 reCurse: Also empirical testing
 reCurse: Unit testing requires you to consciously choose what to test and what to check
 miszu: unit test is to test one function
 reCurse: And also make sure that test is bug free
 miszu: so whatever you test should be simple
 reCurse: Very time consuming in a contest
 UndercoverToad: and update tests with changing requirements
 VizGhar: I'm Android Developer and most of our clients are scared seeing time required for writing unit/ui tests
 miszu: of course it's not full proof but if you have to pick, would you pick a code repo with 80% coverage or 0?
 reCurse: I would pick the repo winning the contest
 UndercoverToad: ok, the requirements are consistent in contests. engine won't chatnge
 UndercoverToad: except for BotG maybe
 Astrobytes: Contest vs real world remember miszu
 miszu: the contest is how long? 10 days?
 Astrobytes: 11 this time iirc
 UndercoverToad: here we do horrible things to gain a few percent in speed
 AntiSquid: ille did unit test botg btw
 UndercoverToad: then he wrote the wrong tests
 miszu: to fully test your engine it takes half a day
 VizGhar: well I have nice and structured code&#160;:) maybe thats why im 250 rank
 miszu: it's not a huge sacrifice but you gain more by foccusing your effort elsewhere
 Astrobytes: I'm in silver, I stop now most probably
 UndercoverToad: noo Astrobytes
 UndercoverToad: go to gold
 miszu: I would like to gold&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It's like pulling teeth
 UndercoverToad: big wooden teeth
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: scottish teeth
 struct: if I change mb and cpu, if I connect my current dirvers will I need to format or will it work without having to format?
 struct: drivers i mean ssd
 particleflux: which OS?
 struct: w10
 VizGhar: never heard of that linux distro
 particleflux: ha :D
 Astrobytes: connect your current SSD drive you mean?
 Marchete: it's an useful desktop
 struct: yes
 Marchete: w10 + WSL2 = linux desktop year
 particleflux: unsure of win10, I guess it *might* work, but you might need to adapt efi settings (AHCI stuff)
 struct: my ubuntu <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/4YxACsB.png">https://i.imgur.com/4YxACsB.png</a>
 AntiSquid: w10 can be updated easily with Linux live USB
 Astrobytes: Yeah make sure the BIOS settings match up with your hardware changes or you might be in for a world of s**T, otherwise should be OK
 AntiSquid: just run the update
 Astrobytes: You don't have *everything* on one SSD do you
 struct: I dont
 struct: I dont have anything that I need in the SSD
 Astrobytes: Just system right
 struct: pretty much
 CommanderCero: brah std::max_element returned the minimum all the time
 Astrobytes: Isn't there a backup option?
 CommanderCero: and im wondering if im stupid (answer yes)
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I think it should be OK struct.
 struct: I see
 struct: but maybe dev build is more fragile
 Astrobytes: Oh dev build?
 Astrobytes: Fuck that
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: I mean Fk that
 ClockSort: hey commander, maybe your values are all negative
 jacek: :o
 CommanderCero: nah they are positive, i've used the values for sorting and that worked as expected. Idk why it happens but im just using my own loop now
 ClockSort: `int mx = a[0]; for(auto&amp; a&#160;: arr) mx = max(mx, a);`
 ClockSort: int mx = a[0]; for(auto&amp; a&#160;: arr) mx = max(mx, a);
 ClockSort: and then you have an empty array and you crash :D
 CommanderCero: well if that happens  I would have a problem anyways xD
 VizGhar: hmm hitting beam width at depth 3 then 4 then 3 again seems wrong right?
 Nerchio: what is depth
 VizGhar: depth of tree (or maybe height)
 VizGhar: distance from root
 Nerchio:  do you clear the queue after width ends and before you add children
 VizGhar: I always remove the node I'm expanding (and that node is always on index 0 of my vector)
 VizGhar: not using best data structures, but I'm just trying to make it work again
 VizGhar: maybe I'm sorting incorrectly somehow... have to check
 Nerchio: well i take X width nodes get children from those, delete the rest, add children and repeat from 0
 VizGhar: you are ranked 55. I'll think about it :D
 Nerchio: thats how beamsearch works (i think?)
 ZarthaxX: yeah taking best X after each action
 VizGhar: I didn't find any good resource on BS for trees
 VizGhar: can you guys recommend?
 Nerchio: no idea :S i mean the concept is not too difficult i guess
 ZarthaxX: ^
 Astrobytes: Essentially just a BFS with restricted breadth
 VizGhar: sure... I cut the nodes after whole 1 layer of tree were expanded...
 Astrobytes: Not sure if this is any use but:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/11358/breadth-first-search-and-beam-search-comparison">https://tech.io/playgrounds/11358/breadth-first-search-and-beam-search-comparison</a>
 Astrobytes: Just game tree nodes rather than maze cell nodes
 VizGhar: So... f.e. expand everything from depth 5. Take 200 best items at depth 6. expand everything from depth 6 ...
 VizGhar: looks like I'm doing exactly that. but incorrectly obviously
 solistice: Ugh, i'm getting crazy, am getting an "Unhandled exception" somewhere after 7 rounds
 solistice: and I can't seem to figure out what is wrong
 VizGhar: hmm solistice can't help you... too little description
 solistice: wish I could give you more
 VizGhar: understandable, solving simillar problem
 solistice: what depths you all are reaching when evaluating states?
 Astrobytes: 0 with current state only :P
 VizGhar: he is probably asking someone from top 10 :D
 Wontonimo: solistice - depth 0 for me
 Astrobytes: Well, looking at top 20 I feel a lot of heuristic bots are up top.
 solistice: nah just in general
 VizGhar: Wontonimo you mentioned, that you will you that depth 0 bot as mirror for your actual bot... still the case?
 solistice: my simulation claims to run to depth 104
 solistice: somehow I doubt that
 Wontonimo: great link about beam search Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: thanks Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: Care to send me some inspiration and motivation in return? :P
 struct: ok
 struct: Im becoming lazy
 struct: I cant code
 Poostang: walking helps
 Poostang: just watch out for sneks
 Wontonimo: Hey VizGhar I just got brutal test up and going locally and am planning on coding my sim after dinner in about 3 hours from now.  I can tell you then once i'm in the thick of it.  but, yeah, the plan is to use the current bot as a heuristic
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 VizGhar: fixed that beamsearch... I was expanding one more item that I should... now back to evaluation
 xdcomrade:  what is the threshold on silver?
 Lachrymosa: question about simming; When I look at the next possible move is instantiating an object that is the board with an implemented move ok to do for each possible step or does this get too cumbersome and I should think of a smaller solution?
 xdcomrade: to pass into silver
 VizGhar: what you mean
 VizGhar: beat the bronze boss xdcomrade... he is threshold
 Nerchio: Lachrymosa its a good start but in the end might be considered too slow
 Lachrymosa: Ok, I am using Python3 and really only hope to Sim 5 moves deep. This being my first Sim and all
 xdcomrade: thx @VizGhar&#160;:)
 scionkiller: Where's the link to the github of the server code?
 VizGhar: I cant imagine replace that structure with something non structural
 VizGhar: are the structures really that heavy to instantiate?
 Lachrymosa: If I do them in a dumb way I'm sure :p
 Lachrymosa: the words bit register have been thrown around, well, a bit. Might try and use that in the object to keep it lean
 Wontonimo: simming with Python3 Lachrymosa!  you go!  I've tried that in other competitions and the best performance i could get was 20x slower than c++
 solistice: how does c# compare to c++ wrt speed?
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: "fixed that beamsearch" - nice one!!
 VizGhar: tnx Astro
 VizGhar: now the more intelligent eval
 Wontonimo: Nice ranking VizGhar&#160;!
 Wontonimo: C# and C++ should be the same speed solistice 
 Wontonimo: (anyone here feel free to correct me as i am no expert)
 VizGhar: tnx Wontonimo... its 2 days without submit. Just learning how the contests works. Completely rewrote my code
 Wontonimo: do you use the brutal tester?
 VizGhar: I'll pull it out tomorrow
 Astrobytes: Completely rewriting your code is standard contest procedure
 Wontonimo: you will not regret it VizGhar 
 Astrobytes: Just don't forget soem vcs
 VizGhar: yeah... I wont do it again for this one
 Astrobytes: *some
 VizGhar: vcs? mean git?
 Astrobytes: Whatever one works for you
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar doing great for first contest&#160;!
 ZarthaxX: idk if you did if else spaghetti complex stuff but anyway
 ZarthaxX: really nice haha
 Wontonimo: killing it even
 ZarthaxX: totally
 ZarthaxX: you too wonto
 Wontonimo: Thanks ZarthaxX :D
 Astrobytes: Hey VizGhar's pretty good ZarthaxX, Wontonimo too! You've been missing their activity recently OutoftouchthaxX
 VizGhar: tnx guys... Hope I can push it to legend. Obviously asking proper questions here in chat helps a lot
 ZarthaxX: wdym astro?
 struct: legend or delete
 ZarthaxX: what did i miss
 Astrobytes: VizGhar and Wontonimo, up and coming CGers!
 ZarthaxX: ah :P
 Astrobytes: SlowwwwthaxX
 Wontonimo: thank man.  off to dinner.  cya all tomorrows
 Astrobytes: Maybe you should have a sloth with a pirate hat
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: wot lol
 Astrobytes: Cya tomorrow Wontonimo
 ZarthaxX: im not slow :C
 ZarthaxX: cya wonto
 ZarthaxX: i wont edit a pic for that slot :P
 ZarthaxX: sloth
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Just kidding man. How are ya anyway
 ZarthaxX: had an interview 2 hours ago
 ZarthaxX: bit tired
 struct: contest ends monday right?
 ZarthaxX: and have class in 1 hour
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Astrobytes: Ooh, how's it go?
 ZarthaxX: i think so
 Astrobytes: *how'd
 ZarthaxX: i think it went well
 ZarthaxX: my gf took same interview yesterday with same recruiter.. so i knew the questions
 ZarthaxX: haha
 VizGhar: :D :D 
 Astrobytes: Hahaha well that's one way to do it :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: hopefully they call me to continue the process
 ZarthaxX: i mean, it wasnt abouts olving problems
 Astrobytes: What if they call your gf instead?
 ZarthaxX: was about talking about my life, current teacher job, uni
 ZarthaxX: oh that would be amazing
 ZarthaxX: i want her to enter :P
 ZarthaxX: there space for both of us anyway haha
 ZarthaxX: is*
 Astrobytes: hahaha be careful what you wish for :D
 ZarthaxX: why :c
 ZarthaxX: they are hiring a lot of people tho
 ZarthaxX: we know some that entered through this thing already
 Astrobytes: You've never worked in the same workplace as your gf before have you
 ZarthaxX: wedid the same subject last year and were in the team together there
 ZarthaxX: but no, i havent worked :P
 Astrobytes: Workplace is different. Like I said, be careful what you wish for :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: well, breakup will be the solution in that case
 struct: astro is scaring Zarthax
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: yeah dude, super negative
 Astrobytes: That's a bit extreme!
 ZarthaxX: bad mod
 ZarthaxX: we have been together for 2 and a half years already... i think we can handle that
 Astrobytes: lol, I just mean it makes work life harder to deal with and work things become personal sometimes. I've seen it happen a million times, only happened to me once tho - so don't worry hard 
 ZarthaxX: i guess it makes sense
 struct: I'm one ctrl shift away from deleting this dev build bs
 ZarthaxX: but the company has many areas
 ZarthaxX: we may not end on the same one
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Astrobytes: Ah I thought you meant the same job ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: so... quick explanation is that it's an IT Bootcamp, where you get prepared for 2 months and THEN you get into one of the teams existing in the company
 King_Coda: never date your coworkers
 ZarthaxX: existing teams*
 King_Coda: thats what my dad told me
 VizGhar: I'm running games against Skril l. that 157000 9/31ms numbers looks extremely scary :O
 ZarthaxX: it's a very big company, that is looking to double their employees btw (16k more)
 particleflux: brb adding random number outputs to my bot
 VizGhar: o.O that's extreme number
 Astrobytes: Gotcha ZarthaxX, sounds cool
 ZarthaxX: mercadolibre if you have heard of it
 ZarthaxX: but i guess it's more of a latin america thing
 Astrobytes: I think I've seen the name somewhere before
 Astrobytes: mercado is market right
 ZarthaxX: they are like ebay, amazon, etc
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: you can put products to sell
 Astrobytes: yeah, so free market
 ZarthaxX: yup
 ZarthaxX: their system works so nice tho, i have never heard anything bad from them lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, definitely seen it before
 ZarthaxX: theyr deliveries are on point
 ZarthaxX: their*
 ZarthaxX: so anyway, that's all
 ZarthaxX: hopefully i continue with the process
 Astrobytes: Best of luck my dude!
 Zenoscave: gz arthie!!!
 Astrobytes: And to your gf also
 Zenoscave: did your gf get a job there too? (missed the first part of gz)
 Rikus: ZarthaxX join Nimble Giant, I can get you an interview in no time (specially considering that I'll be the one interviewing you + two other TechLeads :P) 
 Zenoscave: mmm yum. nepotism
 Zenoscave:&#160;;) ;P
 Rikus: After all you are mlomb's friend, how bad could it be...
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: i think this will end super bad lol
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48507067-7650-4aa1-a4c9-72dabe41830d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48507067-7650-4aa1-a4c9-72dabe41830d</a>
 ZarthaxX: but that's a super cool offer ty &lt;3
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave she did the interview yesterday
 NightScap3: How can I send debug messages over JS without breaking the game?
 Zenoscave: console.error.log
 Zenoscave: i think
 NightScap3: Thanks
 Zenoscave: and gz ZarthaxX
 Zenoscave: again.
 struct: why does the login page have avx ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: ty&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: what?
 Zenoscave: login page?
 ZarthaxX: Rikus is that video games company cool btw?
 CameronWatt: that feel when a challenge makes you feel like a complete idiot
 Zenoscave: I don't need a challenge for that CameronWatt. I always feel that way
 CameronWatt: lol
 Astrobytes: Except when you're not an idiot ofc Zenoscave :P
 Zenoscave: Name one time I
 Zenoscave: I've done something non-idiotic&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Like remember to sleep
 Astrobytes: That's about the only time really
 Zenoscave: Hah! Trick question! I forgot to do that even
 CameronWatt: haha
 Rikus: ZarthaxX it is, we have been around since 2002, aka NGD StudiosEveryone is super cool, tons of friends, board games, beers, etc etc (well beers right now are beers over Discord...)
 Zenoscave: :beers:
 ZarthaxX: wow :O sounds like a chill place to work 
 Zenoscave: well, looks like i'm moving to argentina
 Astrobytes: tbf your question was unclear Zenoscave
 Zenoscave:&#160;;) jk I love my current job too muchAstrobytes: When are double negatives not unclear&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: WHEN I MISREAD THEM. EOF.
 ZarthaxX: Rikus i would love to try in the future maybe, thanks again &lt;3
 Zenoscave: also, hi asrto
 Astrobytes: *arse-tro
 ZarthaxX: the heck
 Zenoscave: lol you said it, not me
 Zenoscave: hi zarthie
 Astrobytes: Maybe I change to ArseTrollBytes
 Zenoscave: hm.... :thinking:
 Astrobytes: And hiya Zeno
 ZarthaxX: hi pewpew
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 ArseTrollBytes: who's zeno?
 Astrobytes: Hahahaha
 Astrobytes: gg
 Astrobytes: wp
 Zenoscave: I had to rename it back before I got euler'ed
 Zenoscave: (Reference to that time euler changed his name and I changed mine to euler)
 Astrobytes: Yes, I was about to do it
 Zenoscave: I figured&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: How's things anyway
 Zenoscave: I broke top 100 yesterday for about 10 min
 Zenoscave: broke above*
 Astrobytes: Nice. Making a real effort?
 ZarthaxX: nice1
 fvla: I'm implementing a beam search for the first time in my life today
 Zenoscave: yup I really am
 fvla: glhf
 Astrobytes: Since I really don't like the game much it's kinda hard to do anything lol. I got Silver but euler insists on Gold so maybe I'll try later.
 VizGhar: what exactly you dont like?
 Astrobytes: The whole game.
 kalman: Does anyone know how to add multiple commands on output? I did not see any instructions on it.
 Astrobytes: I find it utterly soporific.
 struct: This game should have been 3d
 Astrobytes: kalman: in the contest?
 VizGhar: don't do this to me astro... i hate looking up new words
 kalman: yep
 Astrobytes: kalman: A day&#160;!= a turn
 kalman: As long as you have enough sun points, you can take any number of actions. &lt;- I would like to do this
 Astrobytes: Every iteration of your game loop is a turn, but only when both players output WAIT is the day over, and becomes a new day
 Counterbalance: It's 1 action per turn, kalman
 miszu: funny how by just considering neighbors, you improve your code a lot
 kalman: but I see the boss is performing 3 actions until I do only 1
 Astrobytes: I feel this could have used more clarity in the statement struct: do you agree? Many people struggling with the definition
 VizGhar: if you output wait, your oponent still can output other actions
 Astrobytes: ^
 VizGhar: Well its standard board game... every "epoch" is composed of multiple "turns"
 kalman: oh, ok I get it, thanks
 VizGhar: but for those who dont play the board games yes... it have to be confusing
 VizGhar: (or for those who played only CSB)
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: Yes, that's what I mean.
 miszu: alright guys, time to submit my little update
 Astrobytes: #1 or delete
 miszu: ben la
 VizGhar: 0.00 :D 
 Astrobytes: (I *am* joking)
 miszu: 8/10 the first 10 games
 miszu: GG
 VizGhar: oh dbdr is back gooo
 VizGhar: idk why I like him so much... every slovak hates hungarians by default :D
 Astrobytes: It's the French part of him you like. Plus history has no meaning here! :D
 Astrobytes: (that was funn though)
 mybk: When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.
 Astrobytes: *funny
 struct: yes I agree its a bit confusing
 Astrobytes: You are not wrong mybk
 Chainman: After contest are you still not allowed to share code on like github?
 VizGhar: Yeah... All I want is peace... Peace of Ukraine, peace of poland and peace of finland
 VizGhar: you are allowed... but why'd you do that?
 Chainman: Are you russian? :scream:
 Astrobytes: You can share a post-mortem report, code-snippets, but full code-sharing - no
 mybk: for me I want peace for my brothers and sisters in Palestine 
 Chainman: Okay, so it's like the post-mortems I've seen, yeah thats' good
 VizGhar: no... just imagined it.
 VizGhar: mybk :pray:
 Astrobytes: mybk 100% bro
 VizGhar: you can share snippets. no problems with that
 elderlybeginner: what's needed to make local simulations of the contest?Just to calculate different parameters even without graphical visualization?
 Counterbalance: 2 ways: brutaltester and referee, or DIY referee
 VizGhar: brutaltester sounds like the thing you want... don;t have link tho
 elderlybeginner: i don't even know what brutaltester is. I see referee source on github only
 elderlybeginner: this needs to be changed and compiled, and somehow connected as a server to my code?
 elderlybeginner: that kind of tutorial on forum would be interesting
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 VizGhar: but can't help you more
 miszu: top 1000 boys
 Counterbalance: aka the first result when you search for brutaltester&#160;;)
 elderlybeginner: thanks"How does it work? Very simple" - this part of the description is misleading, thou :wink:
 Counterbalance: yeah&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: you'd need a JDK 1.8+, git and apache maven
 Astrobytes: That's why you ask here for help
 Astrobytes: There are Other Ways
 Astrobytes: also hi Counterbalance
 Counterbalance: hey astro
 ZarthaxX: hi counter&#160;:*
 Counterbalance: howdy zarthy :heart_eyes: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 ZarthaxX: doing alright and you
 ZarthaxX: you got a bit romantic after private chat hehe
 Astrobytes: :o
 Counterbalance: yeah going for the inappropriate emojis
 ZarthaxX: haha
 Counterbalance: finished my referee
 Counterbalance: now I need to do something with it
 ZarthaxX: that's the hardest part :D
 Astrobytes: No the hardest part is wanting to work on it at all :P
 ZarthaxX: true :rofl:
 Counterbalance: I'd say something about hard parts but that'd be more inappropriate than the emojis
 VizGhar: jeez I'm not sure how to stop beam at day 24 :D Need some sleep. Byt
 VizGhar: bye
 Astrobytes: gn VizGhar
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Counterbalance :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance damn boi
 Astrobytes: Anyway, see you tomorrow guys n gals, good luck
 ZarthaxX: gn astro
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 Zenoscave: gn
 struct: gn
 Zenoscave: c-c-c-combobreaker
 cegprakash: add a feature -&gt; all weights screw up
 mybk: git is helpful in that situation 
 mybk: just check what you changed 
 easdasd: hello fellow professional python programmer. what is the function for cout in pyton?????????
 mybk: print&#160;? 
 easdasd: bro it say system 32 print error
 Zenoscave: "professional"
 Whatar: print("string")
 easdasd: it say py is not a recognized batch command
 Zenoscave: are you in the CMD prompt?
 easdasd: no i am in my computer
 CameronWatt: i am in a simulation
 CameronWatt: gf
 cegprakash: alter a variable name. get different score
 cegprakash: cegbugs
 Smelty: hi
 mybk: hi
 ClockSort: hi
 cegprakash: hi
 cegprakash: can someone find a bug in this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/552714820">https://www.codingame.com/replay/552714820</a> skril just eats me like a cake
 ClockSort: too busy with my own bugs :D
 LeviathanProgramming: that's cuz you're cake
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: ceg hm lemme see
 Smelty: may or may not be because you didnt bother with the center at all
 cegprakash: he got there before me&#160;:(
 cegprakash: and defended it
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: also he shaded your trees
 cegprakash: seriously man I added the best feature in the whole universe and he gets 172 points against me
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: i added an accountant for selling trees that are shaded and got a 100 rank boost
 Smelty: jk
 HungryBurger: An... accountant?
 cegprakash: nice accountant
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: keep track of shadows
 HungryBurger: I mean, I myself was looking at implementing a scrum master for the next multi-agent game, which is why it sounds like a cool idea to try sometime.
 Smelty: hmm.
 Smelty: well i aint complaining about ranks
 cegprakash: I should stop watching replays with Skril he just ruins my entire motivation
 easdasd: hi guys im ben shapiro
 AntiSquid: so?
 LeviathanProgramming: so he's ben sharpio
 AntiSquid: so?
 AntiSquid: see nobody cares, easdasd
 HungryBurger: ceg -- when that happens, try watching a few games where you curb stomp your rival totoro, to cheer yourself up.
 easdasd: y u mad anti squid
 HungryBurger: I like watching games where I lose (best wya to learn), until I start losing motivation.&#160;:-)
 Smelty: hmm
 Smelty: okr
 Smelty: *ikr
 miszu: nice I reached 718th
 easdasd: ok but im kanye west
 Smelty: anyone got ideas for bot improvements
 miszu: take better decisions
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: strat wise what adding
 miszu: what's your position?
 Smelty: 1154
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/552727736">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/552727736</a>
 AntiSquid: idk ... fixed a bug and expected to climb then dropped 1000 ranks, not exaggerating ,,,
 Smelty: happens to the best of us
 cegprakash: true
 AntiSquid: was my reply to your bot improvement query Smelty
 miszu: Smelty do you believe in shadows?
 cegprakash: shadows are not ghosts lol
 cegprakash: everyone believes it
 miszu: some blieves the Earth is flat
 miszu: Smelty, you should consider some shadow avoidance
 AntiSquid: lol true miszu, its a cube actually
 Smelty: ah anti
 cegprakash: I don't use day anywhere in my eval except for day 23 not sure if it really matters
 Smelty: yes i tried by planting less to tohers
 Smelty: oh lord i added a bit of stuff and now its spamming seeds
 miszu: wow, my rank got boosted to 664th
 Smelty: c  o  n  g  r  a  t  s
 miszu: 665 now
 miszu: can it go to 666?
 miszu: 666!
 cegprakash: grats.. my 2 day old bot ranks 200 higher than my current rank
 cegprakash: such a shame
 is1c1c: i just refactored my code to actually eval the game state instead of a sequence of actions. now its muuuch worse
 miszu: before I submit a new version, I make sure I can beat my bot in arena
 Smelty: congrats
 cegprakash: is1c1c haha
 miszu: you can do that by deleting your opponent AI and adding your arena AI
 Smelty: at the beginning when i switched to eval game state i dropped 100
 miszu: in case people didn't knwo
 Smelty: yep miszu thats what i do
 Smelty: i run 10 tests
 Smelty: and if it wins at least 8 then i sub
 cegprakash: gold opens tomorrow and I've a pleb bot
 miszu: I don't think I will be able to reach gold yet
 ClockSort: how pleb? I'm guessing Gold will be top 500 or so
 cegprakash: yep definitely start with 500 in gold and it can go till 1000 before contest ends
 cegprakash: or even 2000
 cegprakash: there are 5 days
 miszu: my grow algorithm and complete algorithm is pretty trash, anyone has a good heuristics for it?
 HungryBurger: Try completing all your trees on the last three days?
 Glucozen: HungryBurger , it's too late, nutrient have too low value at this moment
 cegprakash: it's a balance
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sayingimages.com/wp-content/uploads/perfectly-balanced-starving-meme.jpg">https://sayingimages.com/wp-content/uploads/perfectly-balanced-starving-meme.jpg</a> 
 Smelty: o.O
 HungryBurger: Haha, well, my simple heuristic starts harvesting trees on the 18th day, but haven't thought about when the opponent does it sooner.
 Smelty: welllllll i just start selling my trees when im confident in my sun production
 cegprakash: Smelty sush!!
 Smelty: yes senapi
 Smelty: *senpai
 AntiSquid: ... damn this barely top 700 
 AntiSquid: the goal post keeps moving
 cegprakash: cheers to 700 club
 AntiSquid: 600 earlier today, but am not the only one improving so ...
 ClockSort: woot, my code is 4680 lines and cannot be submitted. Achievement unlocked!
 AntiSquid: how do you get to that many lines?
 AntiSquid: i am still at 500 or so
 AntiSquid: without comments i mean
 Wontonimo: i'm at 136 lines with comments
 Wontonimo: oh and 10 lines devoted to taunts
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: found perfect heuristics&#160;?
 HungryBurger: Distract by the opponent by taunting it?
 JBM: it's not a heuristic if it's perfect
 ClockSort: you must measure the quality of the aircraft via its weight.
 AntiSquid: or there are long chains of weights  ? :P
 ClockSort: i'm using a tool and including my cpp files in a chain, so Tree.cpp is included 11 times. That's the issue.
 Wontonimo: that's right HungryBurger, gotta play the game
 Wontonimo: the "default" python code is already 42 lines, so I only added 84 lines of code and 10 lines of taunt.
 ClockSort: taunt is more important than sims
 Wontonimo: but i've been crushing over those 84 lines like a maniac for the last few days.
 AntiSquid: i have 3 lines of taunt
 JBM: I don't have taunts yet
 JBM: I'm real late on schedule
 AntiSquid: how else will you get gold&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i think i should add more.  maybe instead just quote My Neighbour Totoro 
 JBM: wild guessing the opponent?
 AntiSquid: no. you need to taunt them
 Wontonimo: you are correct.  what was i thinking
 AntiSquid: i have a Made in Abyss quote
 AntiSquid: similar art 
 JBM: i'm hoping an appropriate retort will be enough
 AntiSquid: of course it times out when i am about to win ... then send to IDE and no timeout ... geeez
 is1c1c: i have this weird bug where its like i get an incorrect game state passed. like i'll be told i have a size 3 tree on some tile i already harvested..
 is1c1c: oh nvm im just an idiot
 cegprakash: what is the points written inside the bracket near richness in the game? I get different points when I cut that tree than what is shown.
 DaNinja: richness+nutrients
 cegprakash: but it doesn't match
 cegprakash: it shows 8 points but when I complete it I get 9 popints
 DaNinja: nutrients at start of day maybe
 AntiSquid: ah you mean viewer isn't synchronized 
 DaNinja: *at start of turn
 Lachrymosa: Hey I've seen some githubs share python script for Discord, but how are they implementing it? does it need to be called with a bot or is there some hidden console I'm unaware of?
 is1c1c: shouldn't it be nutrients + (richness - 1) * 2?
 DJAMES: hi guys
 cegprakash: is1c1c it should be but it isn't matching
 cegprakash: in the viewer
 cegprakash: when u hover a tree it tells u some points
 cegprakash: that doesn't tell how how many points u will get 
 cegprakash: just some random number
 KelvinAndHubbles: wow, implemented a shadow board feature to predict better with beam search and went down 100 places, thought it was just bad, but then 12 hours later realized I put &gt;= instead of &gt; and went up 400 places&#160;:/
 Smelty: wow.
 AntiSquid: broke into top 600, 550 or so . i still hate the game, make no mistake
 AntiSquid: even if i win the contest .
 Smelty: o.
 AllYourTrees: why do you hate the game?
 cegprakash: wow AntiSquid
 cegprakash: what did u improve
 AntiSquid: because it's a really bad game
 AntiSquid: good night btw
 AllYourTrees: night!
 Smelty: nigthy nighty night
 Noyotens: any spring alghorithm
 Lysk: I'm impressed by the leaderboard movements generated the folks submitting
 cegprakash: I think I also broke into top 600 hopefully
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: aaand im in 115
 Smelty: *1150
 cegprakash: staring at leaderboard helps 
 Wontonimo: it does!
 cegprakash: sometimes not.. 5 losses back to back&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: doesn't hurt to also watch the replays
 Smelty: yes.
 Smelty: i just realized that my score calcs were using wrong variables o.O
 Smelty: changing them didnt do anything tho-
 Smelty: beat my old bot 7:3 resubmitting
 aangairbender: dbdr did you improve your beam search?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: anybody understand this from c++: "cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type 'state&amp;' to an rvalue of std::remove_reference&lt;State&amp;&gt;::type' {aka 'State'}" I am trying to put objects in a priority queue
 Smelty: hmm
 actualCoderTrevor: I'm rank 701 - why do I keep imagining what I'll write in a postmortem after I do really well? :joy::sob:
 Smelty: *cries in 1200*
 actualCoderTrevor: Smelty your bot has already won in my eyes with the Rickroll
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: just resubbed
 Glucozen: how much node did you need to have by turn to start being effective&#160;? 
 Smelty: so people actually have the patience to look at the match vs me past the monty python quotes
 actualCoderTrevor: In fairness I was watching your bot before you added those
 Smelty: ah
 actualCoderTrevor: I think I need to spend some time optimizing my bot's speech. That's clearly his weak area.
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: bot stop being stupid and deleting your trees so early&#160;:(
 CharmyRosewolf: My bot says "Henlo!"
 CharmyRosewolf: Do I win?
 actualCoderTrevor: Legend rank at least
 Smelty: YES
 Smelty: added new quote to say first round:
 Wontonimo: i'm glad you are enjoying the quotes.  i should add more
 Smelty: "Imagine being a wood spirit lol"
 Smelty: yes wontonimo
 Lunarhaven: why am I struggling to use a boost so much, aaaa
 Smelty: hmm?
 Smelty: csb?
 Lunarhaven: Ye, csb
 Lunarhaven: wait this channel is for everything on CodinGame isnt it &gt;.&gt;
 ismail9999: @puni[-_-].oO r u here&#160;?
 actualCoderTrevor: Lunarhaven totally but the Spring Challenge is happening and there are only two contests a year, so most of us are working on that. There's no good reason not to participate IMHO.
 Smelty: yea
 Smelty: but LunarHaven you can either take a chance and boost when dist&gt;5000 or save each distance then boost the second round when its best
 Lunarhaven: alright, ty. I'm trying to get to a specific league for a class in school, and it has to b e in CSB, I'll try it out!
 actualCoderTrevor: gl!
 Smelty: gl!
 Smelty: what league r u aiming for?
 Lunarhaven: Silver, and I figured out how to make the boost work, but now my power wont go below 100
 Smelty: oof
 Smelty: so make a counter for boost
 Smelty: and if you used a boost make it 1
 Smelty: and only boost if it is 0, which means no boost so far
 Smelty: because it defaults to 100 if you output boost wihtout boost
 Lunarhaven: I have a counter, that was like the first thing I did
 Smelty: hmm weird
 Smelty: check your thrust function then
 Smelty: if it still doesnt work you can dm me your code and ill check it
 Lunarhaven: i will try lol
 Smelty: ok
 Rabeeb: what do u mean by boost actually?
 Lunarhaven: the CSB thing that makes you go super fast once a match
 Rabeeb: I don't understand, CSB means?
 Lunarhaven: Coders Strike Back
 Rabeeb: r u talking about this forest game?
 Lunarhaven: if you mean the spring challenge, no, Coders Strike Back is one of their other things that my teacher is making me do instead
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: most people here are doing the contest, after all, its just twice a year
 Smelty: my code is 754 lines long :flushed:
 Lunarhaven: :o
 pmor: I'm up to 2k&#160;:\ 
 Smelty: up to 1147
 Smelty: but i recently shortened it
 pmor: finally, i kicked catboss's ass
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: what rank?
 Smelty: i wanna right you
 Smelty: *fight
 pmor: had a bad search n replace that bugged my algorithm 
 pmor: 1st bronze right now
 pmor: waiting to promote 
 Smelty: ahh, thats why i cant find you in silver
 pmor: i have no doubt i'll get crushed in silver right now
 pmor: my eval is pretty basic
 pmor: and I need to implement some sort of pruning
 Smelty: lol
 FerrusDude: @pmor nice bot :D
 FerrusDude: it popped up with me as I made my run to silver.
 pmor:&#160;:)
 FerrusDude: I tried to take more peeps with me but it was not in the cards.
 pmor: can you tell where i stop hording sun points and chop trees?
 FerrusDude: hehehe
 FerrusDude: maybe
 FerrusDude: :innocent:
 FerrusDude: it worked very nicely for that tier. I was keeping my search narrow for the seed casting. Still testing my approach for durability.
 FerrusDude: your the only one that beat me consistently. gg :D
 pmor: hehe.
 Smelty: xD
 pmor: just tested against
 pmor: 1st place silver...got crushed
 Smelty: i first determine which action i want then eval each possible
 Rabeeb: To me, this whole thing is sun arithmetic :3
 FerrusDude: I always know it will get exciting when I see familiar 'faces' pop up
 Rabeeb: Doing simple arithmetic on future suns performs pretty well
 ZarthaxX: what Rabeeb
 FerrusDude: I imagine it does.
 ZarthaxX: you dont have complex stuff???
 FerrusDude: Mine is too naive at the moment
 ZarthaxX: how D:
 aangairbender: finally fixed my beam search
 Majeck: Hello
 Smelty: e
 Majeck: What happens if nutrition &lt; 0
 Smelty: it cant
 Majeck: or is that not possible in the time given?
 Smelty: it stops at 0
 pmor: it caps at 0
 Majeck: Oh ok
 Majeck: Can I get 0 points for harvesting a tree then?
 Rabeeb: Lol ig
 ZarthaxX: Rabeeb are you doing search?
 ZarthaxX: im curious lol
 FerrusDude: no I think you get soil resource only
 VizGhar: 0 + nutrient
 aangairbender: you can theoretically, but in practice you will always get at least one
 VizGhar: 0 + richness sorry
 Rabeeb: @Zarthax no, just arithmetic on future suns
 aangairbender: in the top games players cut around 18-19 trees total
 Smelty: hmm
 Rabeeb: @Zarthax shadow directions are known already
 Smelty: my games, i get around 250 total points
 Smelty: idk how many trees
 ZarthaxX: Rabeeb just trying all actions to maximize sun production?
 Rabeeb: yeah.. that's it :3
 ZarthaxX: damn boi
 aangairbender: Smelty if you opponent is afk maybe you get that much
 ZarthaxX: gz :O
 Majeck: Thanks for the help
 Rabeeb: @Smelty what? 250?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've seen a nutrient of 2, which is still a profit
 Smelty: total points lol
 Smelty: combined\
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Ive had 21 trees cut in a single game
 Smelty: hm
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: very rare
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you can gen 120+pts, u pretty much win imho
 Smelty: lol thats me
 Smelty: but i lose half games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dont know how people do completes at day 13
 Smelty: that ez
 Smelty: i finish my first tree ~day 8
 Zenoscave: PatrickMcGinnisII 140+ is more like it
 Smelty: i just wait to complete more
 Rabeeb: isn't that bad? @smelty
 Smelty: lol
 Rabeeb: keep the tree, get suns, chill
 Smelty: like size3 not complete
 Smelty: *full tree
 Zenoscave: What Rabeeb
 Zenoscave: What Rebeeb said**
 Rabeeb: I said cutting trees is day 8 must be bad
 Smelty: i mean like i can easily complete early its just that i chose not to
 Smelty: i normally start slowly completing at 16
 Rabeeb: lol you can hardcode anything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: anyone track their trees, like how much they cost versus what they generate?
 Smelty: and finish around 22
 actualCoderTrevor: Smelty you lose out on nutrient bonus if you do that
 Smelty: noope
 Zenoscave: I'm agreeing Rabeeb
 aangairbender: rank 35 feels good
 Rabeeb: I think the best hope is to get your AI to systematically find what's best

 jrke: no
 jrke: you can add last league boss in ide
 The_Auditor: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: thanks, i'll give it a try
 The_Auditor: Automaton2000 are you always on?
 Automaton2000: if you go out of range
 The_Auditor: what is your range?
 The_Auditor: i lost you Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what is the last rule change."
 The_Auditor: Automaton2000 why are you here
 Automaton2000: it's the one i got stuck in silver league
 AntiSquid: The-Code-Whisperer just click on the yellow #clash word in chat
 Monsieur_Pook: lol it's just one guy spamming his twitch
 jrke: yeah clash channel just single person spamming twitch links
 DiaZebbiche: Hi
 Mokafela: Hi
 NguyenHuyHoang1: fuck your mom
 ksh_05: 아가리 해라
 Monsieur_Pook: 어? 한국인
 [CG]Thibaud: english please here
 [CG]Thibaud: and obviously no insults, I kicked NguyenHuyHoang1
 Monsieur_Pook: Any tips on code royale?

 MSmits: Monsieur_Pook you need to have some kind of build order, like build two farms, then a barracks etc. Also, you need something to make your queen run away from knights. Preferably around towers. So make sure you build those too
 Monsieur_Pook: I'm still in wood league
 MSmits: ahh, well then it's simple
 Monsieur_Pook: I beat the boss 10/10 times on IDE but I still can't get over the boss in leaderboard
 MSmits: just build what you need to beat the opponent
 MSmits: try picking other opponents
 MSmits: the boss is not your only opponent
 MSmits: also, try switching players, make yourself player 2, see if you have a bug
 Monsieur_Pook: I'm pretty sure I went up against all the people in wood tier 3 
 MSmits: I mean in the IDE
 MSmits: you can select different opponents
 MSmits: obviously you are losing some games
 MSmits: check them out, see why
 Monsieur_Pook: oh wow
 MSmits: and do also switch players. It happens to me a lot that my p1 play is good, but i have a bug as P2
 Monsieur_Pook: Thanks a lot man
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: code royale was my first contest
 MSmits: barely knew what to do back then
 Monsieur_Pook: This took me a few hours to code as well
 Monsieur_Pook: it's really fun though
 MSmits: contests take 10 days, I think I coded non stop because I had to learn all the skills I needed
 MSmits: I doubt I had a more productive week in my life than that one :P
 MSmits: Slept 14 hrs a day for 2-3 days I think, after that
 MSmits: ahh the good ol' days
 Monsieur_Pook: damn! do you get anything if you win the contest?
 MSmits: some contests there are good prices, that one was t-shirts and artwork I think
 MSmits: but they're all hard to win, the ones with good prices and the ones without
 MSmits: prizes
 MSmits: i mean
 MSmits: code royale had around 2k contestants
 MSmits: so you can imagine
 Monsieur_Pook: Everyone's in top 100 haha
 MSmits: who do you mean?
 Monsieur_Pook: oh I mean they give you achievement or something if you get top 100 of a contest
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: I got to the top 3 one, never won a contest though, my best result is 2nd
 Monsieur_Pook: wow! that's still really good
 MSmits: yeah, thanks
 MSmits: btw you can check out any profile of the players here and see how well they did in contests, multis, optims etc.
 MSmits: just remember that the active players that chat here are not an average sample of the community 
 Monsieur_Pook: yeah they're like in top 1000 haha
 MSmits: I think half of them are top 100
 MSmits: also, your overall rank is not exactly the same as your botting skill or how well you do at contests
 MSmits: there's also a time-investment component. If you're here longer and try more different things you'll get more points
 Monsieur_Pook: I'm a total noob but somehow I'm like 5000
 Monsieur_Pook: feelsbadman
 MSmits: yes, many players dont have cp
 MSmits: you need to enter competitive parts of the site for that
 MSmits: puzzles dont cut it
 jrke: yeah bot programming plays vital role in rank
 Nicky1812: guys?
 codeing: yes
 Nicky1812: how to check that character is letters?
 Nicky1812: in python
 SPDene: x.isalpha()
 Nicky1812: ok thx
 SPDene: there's also x.islower(), x.isupper(), x.isdigit()
 Uljahn: there're also internet search engines
 codeing: The limit is only your imagination and your experience.
 Nicky1812: :v
 balance313: hello people of the internet, I am new to programming and trying to learn java. I am doing the power of thor puzzle and wanted to know what kind of command/function i need to say the following:
 balance313:                 move until initialTx == lightX;
 codeing: while(initiialTx&#160;!= ligthX){while(initialTy&#160;!= lightY){initialTy++;} initialTx++;}
 codeing: something like that.
 codeing: let me write correctly.

 codeing: what are you think about guys&#160;?
 JBM: drinking more coffee
 codeing: why&#160;?
 codeing: i'm 17
 dbdr: JBM, inciting minors to use drugs since again?
 dbdr: s/since//
 JBM: i'm just answering their question
 dbdr: both are true at the same time&#160;:)
 JBM: what am i thinking about? i'm thinking about drinking more coffee
 JBM: (and doing it too, by now)
 JBM: i don't see incitation there, but obviously YMMV
 dbdr: right, I'm an idiot
 codeing: i think jbm is right
 JBM: is caffeine classified addictive? i know several people who quit cold turkey without an issue
 dbdr: addiction is orthogonal to drugness I think
 JBM: errr
 JBM: ok
 JBM: what's a drug?
 dbdr: drug = chemically affects the brain
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: ok
 dbdr: not just the brain, apparently
 JBM: those anti-drug movements have it all wrong
 dbdr: &gt; A drug is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed.
 JBM: good one
 JBM: i'll keep it
 dbdr: the lead pic on WP is a cup of coffee :D
 JBM: :D
 Tieuholy: xin chào
 dbdr: oh, I was thinking about "psychoactive drug"
 Tieuholy: こんにちは
 JBM: next up: are drugs forbidden to minors?
 JBM: i'm pretty sure my mum gave me tea
 JBM: and she's rather drastically "anti-drug"
 dbdr: she misuses the term then
 dbdr: coffee is fine for a teenage I think, not recommended for children
 dbdr: but that's what I heard, did not fact check it
 JBM: i had tea by 9, coffee by 20
 JBM: coffee-as-a-pleasure by 25
 dbdr: tea has far less caffeine than coffee generally
 dbdr: so that makes sense
 codeing: @balance313 does my command line ok&#160;?
 dbdr: wow, long time acquiring that taste&#160;:)
 JBM: i heard it had its owd psychoactive that was just as effective
 JBM: well i barely drank any
 JBM: even less so "good" one
 dbdr: tea contains caffeine, same molecule, same effect, apart from the dose
 JBM: all it takes to like coffee is to taste a good one
 JBM: but they'
 JBM: re hard to come by
 dbdr: it's the dose that makes the poison, as the saying goes
 dbdr: IC50 in technical terms&#160;:)
 dbdr: LD50 rather
 Nicky1812: guys?
 Nicky1812: in python 
 Nicky1812: does it have a function that we can change  'abcd' to 'dcba'&#160;?
 JaggBow: 'abcd'[::-1]
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: dbdr sugar can also be a drug
 dbdr: yes, it is
 dbdr: some doctors say it is also technically a poison
 dbdr: fructose, actually
 JBM: i heard they use it as an anesthetic for babies
 JBM: feels weird to think of sugar that way
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: sugar is 'technically' a drug and a poison there is no confirmed statement on the internet that it is always or 100% a drug/poison
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: prove me wrong
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: * i meant fructose
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: last time i talked about the benefits of either windows or linux now it is drugs what is this chat dude
 pro1p: hey can someone help me with this? I'm on power of thor episode 1 and i struggle to resolve an error
 pro1p: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c7c2679-66a0-4a78-a1f3-7f4a27987a71">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c7c2679-66a0-4a78-a1f3-7f4a27987a71</a>

 pro1p: Use of unassigne local variable 'Ydirection'
 pro1p: Use of unassigned local variable 'Xdirection'
 pro1p: written in c#
 QossMean: Initialize Xdirection and Ydirection with ""
 QossMean: Otherwise they will be null
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: damn i was about to write the same
 QossMean: Also there's a logical error
 QossMean: Because 0,0 is top left

 KrisEssa: Hello, can anyone explain to me how to make multiple jumps in 7 turns in Shadows of the Knight, test 4
 Uljahn: KrisEssa: hi, yes, i've sent you a dm
 dbdr: hm, looking good&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ah new language counters now on main page
 eulerscheZahl: language counters?
 dbdr: codingame.com
 eulerscheZahl: do we see the same start page?
 AntiSquid: counter for puzzles solved by language
 AntiSquid: next to certificates
 AntiSquid: clear cache, i have no idea what you are seeing&#160;:/
 Illedan: I see them
 Illedan: C#, JS and Rust for me :o
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/u69oc3">https://prnt.sc/u69oc3</a>
 dbdr: :D
 Illedan: A/B testing?
 eulerscheZahl: ah, ctrl+F5 did the trick
 dbdr: noob&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: C#, then python3, then C++
 Illedan: Max 3?
 AntiSquid: but only first 3 show up ... so any other language doesn't count?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/kZivA0.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/kZivA0.jpg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: C#: 306python3: 47C++: 18
 dbdr: any idea what order they use? random or...?
 Illedan: Most solved I guess?
 dbdr: yeah
 AntiSquid: most solved for me
 Illedan: 96, 8 and 4 :D
 AntiSquid: i have 5 boxes each 
 eulerscheZahl: i think they include multiplayers too
 eulerscheZahl: i have 3x C++ (STC, UTTT, bulls and cows)+ 15 puzzle solutions
 eulerscheZahl: or did I do more in C++ than I had to? :scream:
 dbdr: cannot be, if you were a masochist you would be using windows&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: now time to guess what they showcase in the empty space to the right
 eulerscheZahl: i'll plant a cactus there for now
 Illedan: What name do you give you cactus?
 AntiSquid: activity calendar maybe&#160;?
 Illedan: I don't like this as a start page though. Would more like to see this on a player page. And then view friend activity, recent submits in my recent multies etc etc on the start page
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/mJSVuYo">https://imgur.com/a/mJSVuYo</a>perfect
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: What name did you give your cactus?
 dbdr: CG can hire euler as a graphic designer now
 eulerscheZahl: i'll name it cast-ctus
 eulerscheZahl: no longer needed when python becomes my most used language
 dbdr: coctus?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, it's below the CoC tile...
 dbdr: and has a skull...
 dbdr: so in the theme
 AntiSquid: site activity would be nicer on front page, think someone already mentioned this, but don't see any changes
 xlr4829: whats mean hypothenuse number&#160;??
 jrke: oh dbdr nice lead in D&amp;B
 dbdr: thanks jrke
 [CG]Thibaud: the "view friend activity" will come, but won't be there
 eulerscheZahl: so there's still hope for my CoCtus&#160;:)
 aCat: and 'view contributions' tab of a user
 jrke: dbdr whats your current algo minimax?
 dbdr: yes
 jrke: depth&#160;?
 codeing: @jrke answer my request.
 AntiSquid: [CG]Thibaud but it would be more interesting to have side-wide statistics on front page like the community tool that shows which multis are most active for the current week for example 
 eulerscheZahl: aCat: 7 contributions<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=aCat&amp;category=ANY&amp;author=on">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=aCat&amp;category=ANY&amp;author=on</a>
 AntiSquid: even a #clash link channel or other popular channel links would help a lot more on the front page 
 eulerscheZahl: same game is missing, I should index the puzzles again :thinking:
 AntiSquid: aCat likes clash eh?
 aCat: nope
 aCat: that were my early days
 aCat: from now on only true puzzles
 aCat: try to never touc in-out again
 aCat: CG is not for this
 aCat: nice site euler didn't know about this one
 Schwase: anyone have any good ideas for how to good about learning C++?
 Schwase: i have taken 2 full term java courses but that wasnt recent and ive really only screwed around coding and havent utilized all the tools available
 Schwase: im assuming just coding on CG isnt gonna be all that much help
 AntiSquid: practice? unless you have a particular aim in which case practice it for that particular goal?
 Schwase: im taking a very intensive course that doesnt require prior use of C++ but definitely takes a lot of work if never having used C++ before
 AntiSquid: CG is good too to practice
 Schwase: i guess i should just use C++ so its not unfamiliar
 AntiSquid: very intensive course for beginners? what does it cover? sorry but sounds fishy to me
 AntiSquid: i mean you learn more on CG or similar sites just by doing than any beginner course
 Schwase: not for beginners, the prerequisite is comp sci 1
 Schwase: its not a C++ course
 Schwase: its data structures
 Schwase: and the language used is C++
 AntiSquid: does it include algorithms for the data structures?
 AntiSquid: still no idea what your goal is after learning this so depending on that you will find the answer how to improve your C++ .... 
 Schwase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring18/csci1200/syllabus.php">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring18/csci1200/syllabus.php</a>
 Schwase: this is the course syllabus
 AntiSquid: ya i am sure you learn more on CG just do the multi section or even a single contest
 Schwase: youre saying more than the entire course???
 AntiSquid: well yes just make sure to also read post mortems on forums to give you a better idea
 AntiSquid: here this is more intense than your course imo:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBLr7ISa_YDy5qeATupf26w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBLr7ISa_YDy5qeATupf26w</a>

 Schwase: every term, there is a large assignment that is notoriously hard and long
 Schwase: you get a week to complete it
 Schwase: that ^ was 2018 fall assignment
 AntiSquid: you learn a lot more theory there
 Schwase: im a physics major what am i doing man
 AntiSquid: ping Msmits when you see him online he is a physics person too
 AntiSquid: ask him about C++
 Schwase: ok
 AntiSquid: quite sure he learned a lot by participating on CG

 AntiSquid: dbdr i submitted default code, you know that right? @_@
 AntiSquid: and quite sure i submitted default for other multis when i didn't have time

 aCat: how can I rotate rectangle based on its center?
 aCat: it does not have setAnchor
 JBM: i think you can't
 JBM: it's that bug i haven't fully packed up for reporting yet
 JBM: but jupoulton thinks you can
 JBM: so... we'll see
 aCat:&#160;;/
 eulerscheZahl: put it in a group with shifted center
 eulerscheZahl: and rotate the group
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I did for Onitama (rotating movement cards)
 eulerscheZahl: btw if you want to get stuff fixed in the SDK, making a pull request with a fix can accelerate things&#160;;)
 aCat: I don't get the relation between the original coordinates, and shift coordinates /rotate when in group
 aCat: I mean tried 2 things and didn't work
 playerZER0: o/
 AntiSquid: o/
 eulerscheZahl: you draw your rectangle around the point (0,0), e.g. from -100 to +100
 eulerscheZahl: put it inside a group and place the group where you want the actual center of the rectangle
 eulerscheZahl: then you rotate the group
 eulerscheZahl: or was it more complicated? like rotating and moving at the same time? :thinking:
 JBM: ithink your way works
 JBM: it's just completely unnatural to me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/src/main/java/Onitama/view/CardView.java#L86">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/src/main/java/Onitama/view/CardView.java#L86</a>read this if you are brave enough
 JBM: it made me think rotating a group killed the non-sprite shapes for quite some time
 eulerscheZahl: i do 2 commits with half the rotation to chose the direction (clockwise / counterclockwise)
 eulerscheZahl: took me a bit as well to get it right. especially as onitama also changes the center of the rotation depending on the card position
 JBM: huh
 JBM: doesn't it just take its sign?
 eulerscheZahl: so it's 2 nested groups moving inside each other
 eulerscheZahl: if you do a 180° turn, the SDK decides the direction
 JBM: *surprised*
 eulerscheZahl: also you can only rotate by full degree angles, there is some: toDegrees().round()
 JBM: that's enough for me
 JBM: i'm gonne have to check that 180d turn though
 JBM: i can't have gotten all the rotations right in tvc by chance
 eulerscheZahl: you can believe me, i was cursing about this for a while :D
 JBM: i'd like to believe you
 eulerscheZahl: i mean believe that i was in rage. not that i recall every little detail
 aCat: ok done
 aCat: I already did it correctly
 aCat: but used degrees :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 JBM: rotations are in radians
 JBM: how can it even check for ==180
 eulerscheZahl: and then converted to degrees for serialization
 JBM: ok let's assume it converts right
 JBM: testing with positive Math.PI
 JBM: turns left
 JBM: can't remember if that's expected
 eulerscheZahl: now try negative PI
 JBM: let's have a pi/2 to clarify
 JBM: that's kind of enough, pi/2 goes right
 JBM: OMGWTF
 JBM: good thing i never used a 180 *at all*
 JBM: how can that even happen
 eulerscheZahl: and that's why onitama does the rotation in 2 parts with half a frame each.but somehow i have a feeling that the rotation speed isn't constant when watching replays
 eulerscheZahl: that's where I decided to rage-quit
 JBM: this is so unexpected it warps the mind to think how they'd have implemented that behind the scene
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure which part is an SDK quirk and which is just pixi
 JBM: some people need a good affine geometry refresher
 eulerscheZahl: another one: try to draw a polygon with line color+thickness and fill color
 JBM: naaaaw i don't do complex stuff like that
 eulerscheZahl: the first and last point won't be connected by a line but it will be filled
 JBM: i made a sprite of everything after i discovered the rotation thingy mentioned above
 JBM: looks better too
 JBM: ok so git checkout doesn't erase the local modifications anymore
 JBM: what human-friendly name have they given *that* now?
 JBM: "-f"
 eulerscheZahl: git reset --hard
 JBM: ok i'll deal with it
 JBM: yeah that's my alternative way, but i had a git checkout in the command line buffer
 eulerscheZahl: that's a good reason :D
 JBM: i try to use reset mostly when i want to move the commit pointer
 JBM: same effect, different mindset
 AntiSquid: i use arch
 JBM: typical
 Allis: Typical of...?
 dbdr: of arch users
 Allis: :laughing:

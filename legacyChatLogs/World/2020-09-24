 Uljahn: yep, an you can write a paper about it
 Uljahn: *and
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: you're too smart for this timeline
 Automaton2000: i am not sure what that is
 erFylo: do u have the solution?
 erFylo: im bad

 anantaCodes: Am struggling to get this printed in a single line.
 anantaCodes: Doin this in JS. Am not using an array. But using a string
 jacek: single line?
 jacek: printing occurs line by line. so you'd likely need to use array for this puzzle
 jacek: and fill the array first, then print from the array
 lollo1: ehi guys
 Frank89: i use matrici so...
 anantaCodes: Yea I was thinking about that. but wanted to know if I can do with a string @jacek

 Tiki69: i am new how this works
 Rodrigo_the_coder: what language to be explained
 Squidkid45: you find a puzzle that interests you, you struggle to do it correctly in all the cases and then you submit it and get it reviewed
 Rodrigo_the_coder: no the code language
 Rodrigo_the_coder: like javascript
 Frank89: did u know about scratch? preaty funny i think
 Rodrigo_the_coder: yes

 TritiumBond: Was that funny?
 Astrobytes: What level are you TritiumBond? (I have the same issue)
 Astrobytes: If you know, that is
 TritiumBond: level 6
 Astrobytes: Hm, very odd
 TritiumBond: and have reached gold in CSB
 Astrobytes: It's been happening these past few days
 TritiumBond: thank you for the help
 Astrobytes: Sorry I can't help but I'll mention it in the bug thread on discord
 TritiumBond: Yeah, thanks for that too, cheers
 Astrobytes: TritiumBond are you logged into chat from the site or an external client?
 Zoe_Witte18: Hey gm
 Astrobytes: Hello
 Tiki69: how this platform works i am new as i have onle done 8 people clash and its preety awesome something more to this that i am missing?
 Astrobytes: There are puzzles here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 Astrobytes: Multiplayer bot programming, optimisation and code golf here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 Astrobytes: So yes, definitely more&#160;:)
 Tiki69: Thanks buddy&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You're welcome
 jacek: apparently there is something more to this site than clashes :O
 Astrobytes: Who'd have thought it
 Q12: Hey, How can I print messages in multiplayer game? ('SHOW MESSAGES' is on)
 LiquidSteam: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: which game Q12?
 Q12: Spring Challenge 2020
 Uljahn: sometimes it's enough to add space and message to your output
 Astrobytes: Hm, don't know if you can print a message in pacman
 Q12: It worked. Thanks Uljahn
 Q12: But how can I decide above which pacman to show the message?
 Q12: Astrobytes I sure you can, I saw others doing it
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, didn't see it in the statement, my bad
 Q12: I agree because of this I didn't know I could
 Astrobytes: I suspect you can't choose the pacman to print the message above, you could try printing it before the | but I don't think it will work
 Q12: Never mind. I found where it said.Append text after any command "for a pac and that text will appear above that pac"
 Q12: But Thanks
 jacek: Astrobytes not reading the statement again?
 Astrobytes: lol, I must be blind
 Q12: It was hiding
 Q12: under  Debugging tips
 Astrobytes: Aha
 Q12: It should be in the output also
 Astrobytes: I only searched the statement for 'print' and 'message'
 Astrobytes: jacek, it's The Curse of Ceg again
 Q12: What 'The Curse of Ceg' is?
 Astrobytes: lol, don't worry. Just referencing a guy who never reads the statement&#160;:)
 Q12: :laughing:
 inklingx9: hello new here just
 inklingx9: how does this chat work right here and
 inklingx9: :grinning:
 inklingx9: so who is using the chat normally do
 TritiumBond: Wait just check this one
 TritiumBond: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/488874856">https://www.codingame.com/replay/488874856</a>
 TritiumBond: :sweat_smile:
 inklingx9: :laughing:
 TritiumBond: The messages were unexpectedly a bit synchronized 
 TritiumBond: :joy:
 inklingx9: well it is my auto correct that is doing this so yeah I just roll with it was
 TritiumBond: :upside_down: Still do check
 inklingx9: one day I will change my auto correct settings and it will be epic
 TritiumBond: Best of luck for that day, cheers
 inklingx9: yeah cheers
 inklingx9: so what is used the most this chat or discord
 TritiumBond: Sorry, I don't know much, today is only my first day on this platform.
 inklingx9: oh ok well
 inklingx9: then you
 inklingx9: no you autocorrect!
 TritiumBond: :smiley:
 inklingx9: yeah it sometimes is just annoying but it still helps me soooooo yeah

 midomawk: if name == "something"big O is 1 or n&#160;?
 Q12: There is problem with the pastebin
 Q12: We can't see what do you mean
 jacek: big O is whatever * in O(*)
 Q12: Its 1
 midomawk: should i consider in O(1) or O(*)
 inklingx9: hey anyone going join discord server
 midomawk: because after all we compare the ascii code
 midomawk: one by one 
 Q12: I undestand what you mean now
 Q12: Try looking it in google
 midomawk: i did but not clear sometimes O(1) sometimes they say O(*)
 jacek:&#160;?
 jacek: comparison is O(n) for n size string
 Q12: It's O(n) according to stackoverflow
 jacek: because you compare char by char
 midomawk: so for any comparison&#160;? O(n)integer float ...
 midomawk: after all we compare bit per bit
 Q12: If your'e right
 Q12: *I think
 jacek: technically yes
 midomawk: thank you guys
 orestarod1: well this is bad
 jacek: is this homework assigment?
 orestarod1: we gotta do something mickey

 midomawk: just im working to improve some solutions and i need to describe the complexity for them
 Q12: Interesting...never thought about this :slight_smile:
 Q12: about the time complexity of this
 jacek: who ever needs that
 jacek: well maybe for horse racing puzzle
 Astrobytes: inklingx9 can you stop spamming links to the discord server, the link is above the chat if anyone needs it
 Q12: It can make your run time shorter, I think everyone want shorter run time :slight_smile:
 inklingx9: oh sorry
 Q12: Of course it is also depends on the effort you need to put in it
 Uljahn: Astrobytes: he's promoting his own server :smirk:
 inklingx9: well that was just a reaction I did not expect
 Q12: Like the new profile design :grinning:
 Astrobytes: even better Uljahn
 Astrobytes: inklingx9 stop promoting your own server
 inklingx9: ok I'll
 inklingx9: stop
 inklingx9: sorry autocorrect does this
 Uljahn: fix it
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 inklingx9: I fixed it
 eulerscheZahl: read the discord messages first, then the CG chatI have an idea whom astro tried to kick
 Astrobytes: the sweary one
 eulerscheZahl: is that the same as the inky one?
 Astrobytes: don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: then i missed your troll
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure it was the same guy who I warned and deleted his messages on discord
 eulerscheZahl: i miss a lot then
 Astrobytes: He had a rather racially offensive nick in here
 Astrobytes: And was f'ing etc all over the place for no apparent reason
 Astrobytes: I think someone talked him down eventually, I was afk after that
 eulerscheZahl: must resist to make a pun :sweat:
 Astrobytes: Why resist?
 jacek: what pun
 eulerscheZahl: astro -&gt; private messagehe will let you know how bad it is
 Astrobytes: Yes, move along. Nothing to see here :P
 inklingx9: hey this a fun community and
 jacek: aww
 Astrobytes: Why does your autocorrect insert random conjunctions?
 eulerscheZahl: is that the next generation of automaton?
 Astrobytes: I think that would be a step backwards for him
 Astrobytes: Well, maybe an improvement for NN
 inklingx9: yeah it is just weird I turned it off and it still does it.
 inklingx9: huh I found a way to stop it.
 jacek: AutomatonNN do you have autocorrect
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Zenoscave:  Automaton2000 tell AutomatonNN what he means
 Automaton2000: i think i have a problem with the code
 AutomatonNN: for the first time i can continue with the same testcase and the game is a bit more than that i got 
 G-Rom: Your codingamer profiles have been reworked. Don't hesitate to give your feedback
 Illedan: Black background on tne Progression and Ranking?
 Illedan: Like the bars though
 uvBoss: hot admn
 Q12: I like it :grinning:
 DomiKo: that's pretty cool
 Illedan: Nice to see the Programming Languages
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, no skills? xD
 DomiKo: nice to see colors int ranking
 eulerscheZahl: no talent, sorry
 Astrobytes: Looks nice
 Illedan: Now I have more motivations to solve problems in other languages :O
 Q12: Maybe you can add the contributions of each user in his profile
 Illedan: ^
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that would be pretty useful
 G-Rom: sure, it will probably come
 Q12: :thumbsup:
 G-Rom: maybe alongside with playgrounds
 Q12: Yes
 Astrobytes: That would make sense, yes
 Illedan: Maybe top 3 contest results too? (those counting towards the rank)And last games played?
 G-Rom: hum, I don't know. The goal of this profile is more to get a kind of "skills/cv" page than an activity profile
 G-Rom: top 3 contests are visible when you click the rank tile
 Illedan: Yeah, but you have to go find them&#160;:)
 Philbot: so you need 30 puzzles per language to get 5 squares
 G-Rom: why would you like to see that on other profiles than yours?
 Philbot: to stalk others see what they play
 Astrobytes: Keeping things competitive&#160;;)
 Illedan: ^
 mootez_nabli: hi
 Philbot: if someone plays go doesn't mean i want to compete with them 
 Unkmar: Agreed, Some of us are really only competing with themselves.  A learning platform.
 Astrobytes: No of course, but there is a spirit of competition amongst groups of users too
 Philbot: i like to see what others like dont need to compete
 Astrobytes: And if you can see someone's activity on a game, it might be a game you didn't see before, thus increase participation
 Astrobytes: For sure Philbot, I get that totally
 Q12: Suggestion: make another mode in clash of code - efficiency. I think many people will like it.
 Astrobytes: You can post that in the forum I think Q12, not really related to the profile update&#160;;)
 Q12: But now the right people can see it
 Q12: But I understand...
 Astrobytes: OK, I get your thinking there lol
 Philbot: efficiency as in speed of the program?
 Q12: yes
 Astrobytes: But the staff do read the forums too&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: like: i liked Hooch Clash so much, let's see what other puzzles the author created :scream:
 Philbot: but then some languages always win others always lase
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Q12: Philbot Easy mode is also like this 
 Q12: eulerscheZahl Like it
 krolik: Nice profile update guys, only thing I still miss is that there's no 'follow' button on profile page
 Philbot: you wanna fite me Q12? why red color at me?
 Philbot: 1 on 1 clash???
 Astrobytes: lol, it does that when you mention a username
 Q12: haha
 Astrobytes: krolik: there is?
 jacek: it is
 G-Rom: it doesn't show on your own profile
 G-Rom: that's make sense, isn't it? :P 
 Astrobytes: I would say so indeed
 Illedan: Social links would be nice as tiles on a profile page too. Like github, linkedin, twitter etc, if the user has specified those in the fields not existing yet :P
 krolik: Yeah I know I can't follow myself, I just don't see it on any profile, just on those little popups when I hover on avatar
 eulerscheZahl: what's that facebook?and where can I link my codeforces profile?
 Illedan: ^ that too
 Q12: Yo can put link to it in the ABOUT ME section
 Astrobytes: krolik: the button above the Ranking on the profile 
 MATRIX369: hey
 Illedan: W000t
 Illedan: We can add gifs to our About me :D
 Astrobytes: I didn't realise you had such a burning desire for that feature :P
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: how could I miss that?
 krolik: Astrobytes: that appears to be a browser or my settings problem. I'm using opera, but I've just checked it on chrome and there is a button indeed
 eulerscheZahl: much better
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I need to add the gif of my avatar, so that everyone sees it's a bird
 Astrobytes: krolik: Ah I see, must be your settings or an extension then, I can see it in Opera
 eulerscheZahl: you mean a fish
 Astrobytes: Seals are not fish, they're mammals
 Astrobytes: And yes, it looks more like a seal than a bird.
 Astrobytes: haha your gif is perfect euler
 krolik: Yup, that was adblock, turned it off and it showed up
 Astrobytes: Nice one&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan only needs 2,819 XP to level up
 eulerscheZahl: that's cute
 Illedan: pffff
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan you broke your link
 Illedan: Trying to see if I can show videos there
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Testing their markdown 
 Illedan: Nice, we can use details sections

 Astrobytes: damn you
 Astrobytes: chat vandal
 The_Auditor: what happened here&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: what do you mean? ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 Q12: eulerscheZahl decided he wants to destroy the chat :laughing:
 eulerscheZahl: i might have a memory leak
 The_Auditor: Automaton2000 can you fix this?
 Automaton2000: you might get a better score
 Astrobytes: All we need now is for one of the automatons to do it and we're fully screwed
 The_Auditor: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN started it
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a simulator and then go to the next contest
 eulerscheZahl: that's how i found out about it
 eulerscheZahl: damn you
 Astrobytes: hahaha right on cue
 Illedan: hehehe
 Illedan: YOu can add links on gifs on a profile :D
 Illedan: hidden link
 eulerscheZahl: and Illedan failed with audio so he added an audi?
 Illedan: Refresh
 Illedan: and click the cat :P
 The_Auditor: i wonder if we can make Automaton2000 become frends with AutomatonNN and start chatting with each other
 Automaton2000: but how do you save the state of the game
 AutomatonNN: what are you up to do i get his next contest?
 eulerscheZahl: i remember the URL and won't click that link
 Illedan: x
 Astrobytes: There is something to be said for keeping your headphones/speaker volume low you know :P
 Illedan: Hmm, any ideas on how to center align everything in that About me? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: 𒐫
 eulerscheZahl: that's some nice spamming too
 eulerscheZahl: only counts as 2 chars
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Is the text in About me limited size? 
 eulerscheZahl:  ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺ͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩ 𓀐𓂸
 eulerscheZahl: oh, going upwards
 eulerscheZahl: and down?
 eulerscheZahl: yep
 Astrobytes: ffs
 Illedan: ooohh
 Illedan: Code works too
 Illedan: ofc
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: But damn
 Illedan: not like I wanted
 Illedan: Now
 Illedan: With syntax
 eulerscheZahl: it's markdown, not discord syntax
 Illedan: yeye
 Illedan: Refresh
 eulerscheZahl: never!
 emh: how can I do in perl what echo$(cmd) does in bash? i.e. remove double spaces and preceding and trailing space? for code golf
 emh: hopefully in less than 6 chars
 Astrobytes: you need a regex iirc
 emh: I think regex will be too big
 Astrobytes: Might be something in String::Util but then that's gonna be extra chars too
 Astrobytes: Do we even get that on CG? I donno
 Astrobytes: Or call awk from perl :P
 informathemusic: What's this ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 Astrobytes: an underscore
 Astrobytes: Oh not you as well
 informathemusic: (I was asking quite literally, how does this happen)
 Astrobytes: some unicode thing iirc
 Uljahn: google zalgo
 Astrobytes: So. Annoying.
 The_Auditor: why there is no "path" for code golf on homepage&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It's in the optimisation pathway
 The_Auditor: hm, unexpected
 Astrobytes: It's a form of optimisation in a sense I guess&#160;;)
 The_Auditor: yeah, right next to linear regresion
 Astrobytes: hahaha

 MadKnight: fix the description then
 G-Rom: (so AntiSquid probably solve a lot of puzzles :P )
 G-Rom: don't
 eulerscheZahl: or doesn't vote
 G-Rom: yep
 eulerscheZahl: i've only voted on a single puzzle on CG

 AntiSquid: got to 2nd what tbali said, it feels lie now you're forced to do all languages in 30 different puzzles @_@
 AntiSquid: like  *
 CursedFRA: Can someone help me on the encryption/decryption of enigma machine in C please?
 The_Auditor: help with the puzzle or with C&#160;?
 CursedFRA: sent you a private message
 Schwase: is there any way to directly message someone who is not in world or no? would my best chance be to see if they are on the discord server?
 AntiSquid:  /msg Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: you think the problem is that i can use it on cg
 AntiSquid: would be funny if you private messaged users Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but the only way i could think of
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 can actually send/msg peoplenothing will happen
 Automaton2000: write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. if two numbers are equally close to ...
 AntiSquid: what are you up to MadKnight?
 Westicles: All languages in 30 puzzles?
 AntiSquid: 30 each
 Westicles: A new achievement or something?
 AntiSquid: yes sort of not really new as it appears on front page too#

 icecream17: 1 minute left to comment on troll vs castles, congrats jbm
 icecream17: although those comments arent really helpful
 JBM: one minute left until it's a few seconds left for an entire hour
 JBM: then it'll be 30 days again
 icecream17: that's a really extended comment period
 The_Auditor: that is the process to correct the auto generated code for a puzzle&#160;?
 The_Auditor: what
 The_Auditor: the puzzle is not new
 Uljahn: report in the puzzle related topic on the forum or on discord
 The_Auditor: that topic is flooded with questions about the puzzle...
 The_Auditor: ok, i'll try
 The_Auditor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/encryptiondecryption-of-enigma-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/encryptiondecryption-of-enigma-machine</a>
 The_Auditor: doesn't have a discussion tab
 The_Auditor: and there are multiple forum topics
 The_Auditor: does the discussion tab appear only after you solve the puzzle&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Some older puzzles don't have a linked forum topic, it's automatic these days for new puzzles
 Astrobytes: You can search in the forum

 Astrobytes: ah, didn't see your other post, sorry
 Astrobytes: What's up with the auto-generated code The_Auditor?
 MadKnight: Astrobytes it doesn't skip the \n char after reading line
 MadKnight: so the next read gets the \n directly
 The_Auditor: i posted on first thread, can't post on the second, same post text detected.
 The_Auditor:  instead of fgets(rotor, 27, stdin);it should befgets(rotor, 27, stdin); fgetc(stdin);
 Astrobytes: ah, there are some C related stub issues, create a new forum topic or post in this one maybe:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/problem-with-c-stub-in-contributions/186525">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/problem-with-c-stub-in-contributions/186525</a>
 jacek: who uses C anyway
 sDCrAZzE: i dunno
 sDCrAZzE: c is kinda wierd
 Astrobytes: Oh hey MadKnight, your message didn't show up for some reason, yeah
 Astrobytes: *yeah, that's the one
 sDCrAZzE: hehe im so confused i want to die:confused:
 Metanoob: :grimacing:
 sDCrAZzE: teehee
 sDCrAZzE: im in FaZe
 Astrobytes: hi Metanoob
 Metanoob: Heyo&#160;:)
 The_Auditor: please don't dis C, it is the grandfather of many languages
 Metanoob: I work with C on a daily basis, with love too!
 Astrobytes: jacek was trolling don't worry
 Metanoob: jacek is cool ye
 Metanoob: can't we code in double rot13 instead
 The_Auditor: but working with C every day...that is rough
 Astrobytes: Troll-in-chief ay jacek
 Astrobytes: *eh jacek
 The_Auditor: it's like making salad with a katana
 Astrobytes: Not if the tasks require C it isn't
 Metanoob: The_Auditor it's alright, I left frontend madness a year ago
 MadKnight: imagine frontend with C
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 The_Auditor: horor :scream:
 Metanoob: The_Auditor haha yes, fortunately it's a katana I get to work on so I'm happy to :D
 Metanoob: C frontend framework
 Metanoob: not sure I can even wrap my head around that haha
 The_Auditor: I left the front end years ago, so I get it Metanoob. i'm fortunate to find backend java jobs
 Metanoob: You did? It's madness right?!
 Astrobytes: 5 weeks work... yay, an empty page
 Astrobytes: (slight exaggeration)
 The_Auditor: front end is not my cup of java :D
 Metanoob: :D
 The_Auditor: two pixels to the left, a little lighter green...
 Astrobytes: I had to do some around 2000. That was rough.
 The_Auditor: in the end I end up schooling the front end team mates on ther right way of doing things&#160;:/
 Metanoob: everyday a new js framework picked from a random word in the dictionary is being born
 The_Auditor: :joy: totaly
 sDCrAZzE: im so confused dude
 MadKnight: what's the today's word, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think we need a new league
 MadKnight: an Automaton2000 league
 Automaton2000: if you get beaten by language y
 The_Auditor: nah, AutomatonNN has better word of the day
 AutomatonNN: when u got the achievement for a second they give you the solution
 Metanoob: is it legal for bots to do drugs?
 Astrobytes: AutomatonNN was born high
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Metanoob: you're in a new league
 The_Auditor: yeah, you tell them AutomatonNN&#160;!
 AutomatonNN: maybe it's the same player in the contest and i got some bots and the boss is the game for this cont
 Metanoob: haha
 Metanoob: I want to know more about you AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: cuz i think it is a good idea
 The_Auditor: AutomatonNN is Automanon2000 your friend?
 AutomatonNN: AutomatonNN you can get a good replay
 The_Auditor: if i can spell
 The_Auditor: AutomatonNN is Automaton2000 your friend?
 Automaton2000: i have no idea how to fix the problem
 AutomatonNN: Automaton2000 is a bot who wants to read the referee that i don't know how to do it
 Astrobytes: lol nice
 Metanoob: are those accounts owned by humans solving the puzzles? Or are the bots solving puzzles on their own too?
 Astrobytes: They're just chatbots
 The_Auditor: bots
 Metanoob: cool ok
 Metanoob: when I see NN I'm getting easily impressionable :p
 Astrobytes: think there's an article on the blog about them
 Astrobytes: It is a NN yeah
 The_Auditor: there is a puzzle how to make the Automaton2000 dictionary or the word probability data structure
 Automaton2000: and if you can't figure it out :p
 Metanoob: haha nice
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/</a>
 Automaton2000: but you can tell the difference between the two
 Metanoob: ye I was thinking about markov chains haha
 Metanoob: isn't it how T9 was implemented back then?
 Metanoob: thanks for sharing the link, I guessed they were some kind of mascotts on CG
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think a lot of predictive text used or uses (to a lesser degree now) markov chains at least partially
 Astrobytes: there's also bots in clash of code, but that's quite different
 Zenoscave: Should we make Automaton2000 a Clash bot?
 Automaton2000: maybe if i make it so much
 AntiSquid: nobody else bothers with the tags, looks a like somewhat wasted effort :p
 Astrobytes: that would be 'interesting' Zeno :D
 The_Auditor: what tags&#160;?
 AntiSquid: the tags you can get for solving puzzles opti multi golf
 Zenoscave: interesting is a word
 AntiSquid: hope clash doesn't give tags
 The_Auditor: the tags, it's just been added, right?
 Astrobytes: good point AntiSquid
 The_Auditor: give it some time, i have 4 tags
 AntiSquid: yes but you can activate for the ones you solved
 AntiSquid: you can easily use a macro, just google macro editor#
 Metanoob: +1 for having  a clash bot tho
 Astrobytes: they just use existing solutions, nothing fancy
 AntiSquid: clash bots already exist Metanoob
 Astrobytes: Just there to fill the space if there's not enough human participants
 AntiSquid: and then people spam clash links in chat and complain they get bots 
 Astrobytes: and yeah, what AntiSquid said is true, user-created, not official
 Metanoob: I'm so 2016 ugh...
 Metanoob: ok cool I didn't know thanks
 The_Auditor: anybody looking forward to getting a 1 sec submission by a bot in the clash&#160;?
 Astrobytes: There's an article on the blog about that too, but i'm not linking it cos I'm going offline now :P
 Metanoob: yes, only if it is clash bots vs clash bots
 Metanoob: Ah alright Astrobytes see you around I guess&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I'm around most of the time so yeah&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: laters all
 Metanoob: then we would start betting and make illegal bot fights to Seg fault

 LinhT.Nguyen: given a number of digit 1's, place in '*' and '+' so that the result of math operation is highest
 LinhT.Nguyen: probably doing math with a bunch of digits whose sum is the given n
 2ndwolf: meh I fell on one that asked to write out every (first, second, third...) to concatenate with results.
 2ndwolf: I just left, it made no sense
 aaravm4: ruby is amazingly good for short

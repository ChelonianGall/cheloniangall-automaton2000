 kouin: do the leaderboards get automatically recalculated from time to time?
 cegprakash: damn.. contest rank #70.. recalc rank 90. now back to rank #76
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey cegprakash, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 cegprakash: I don't like recalc
 hopee: b0b
 hopee: 0
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 71 taco. jacek now has 39 taco
 Automaton2000: i have no idea how to solve the problem
 Automaton2000: i dont know how i would do
 Wontonimo: hello?
 5DN1L: hello
 Wontonimo: hey, long time since we've chatted.  How was the contest for you?
 raxkin: Ahh, just fixed a bug on my defense where i was not calculating correctlly the turns to reach the spider, to determine if i can kill it or if i need a backup. And also a minor bug on the farming calculations. Went from 131 to 34 lol. Sad that i found it now that contest is over&#160;:(. I could have pushed for top 20
 5DN1L: first contest for me, interesting one
 Wontonimo: cool you found it, sad not in time raxkin
 Wontonimo: oh yeah, this would have been your virgin contest 5DN1L
 5DN1L: yes
 raxkin: Second one for me, and second legend too. I love this contests
 Wontonimo: you got legend in Totoro (the hex farming game)&#160;?
 Wontonimo: I barely squeezed into legend Totoro.  That was my first
 raxkin: Yep, that was my first too. I think it was more hard than this one, to understand what was happening
 raxkin: This was easy to find the problemems by looking at the replays
 raxkin: Oh, there more removed users from legend? I think they said they removed 10, from 400 went to 490, but now there are 368 in legend
 raxkin: from 400 to 390*
 5DN1L: they're fixing the issue of incomplete import of bots
 Jaoie: hi
 LaurensD: it's fine like this, someone who I wanted to beat ended lower because of the import bot issue. It's a sign! keep it this way
 Jaoie: #pt
 raxkin: What is the impor bot issue exactlly?
 5DN1L: incomplete
 5DN1L: not all bots were imported
 5DN1L: that's the issue
 raxkin: Ah, ok
 Wontonimo: it's 3am for me.  gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gn
 raxkin: gn!
 Jaoie: gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It used to be you had to enter the multi and resub your code, or a variant thereof

 JFB: list = sorted(dict, key=lambda x: dict['Start] * 1e10 - dict['End'])
 JFB: list = sorted(dict, key=lambda x: dict['Start'] * 1e10 - dict['End'])
 Uljahn: :worried:
 JFB: (if first post I omitted ' at the end of the 'Start')
 Kokoz: I get TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable
 JFB: Sorry my mistake:
 JFB: list = sorted(dict, key=lambda x: x['Start'] * 1e10 - x['End'])
 JFB: Once again I make mistake&#160;:-)
 JFB: One moment&#160;:-)
 Uljahn: you're using keywords as variable names :crying_cat_face:
 JFB: l = sorted(dict, key=lambda x: dict[x]['Start'] * 1e10 - dict[x]['End'])
 BenjaminUrquhart: pretty sure dict is also reserved
 Uljahn: ^
 Kokoz: It works. Thank you :3
 JFB: yes, so now I used l instead of list&#160;:-) And instead of 'dict' reserved word, in ipython I tested this last post and is OK
 BenjaminUrquhart: well yeah it works, that doesn't mean you should do it
 Merci_A_Vie_vite_laire: List of dict of int table of hashset of list is the better way to do a good list
 Uljahn: i'd use pandas dataframe
 Uljahn: also i'd use key=lambda x: (my_dict[x]['Start'], -my_dict[x]['End'])
 JFB: Kokaz used 'dict' as variable name in his post. So I used it in solution. Of course is better not use reserved words as variable name
 BenjaminUrquhart: So my best bot for spring 2022 got ~120th silver during the contest. It's top 3 silver right now in the multi. 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I am in pain
 Merci_A_Vie_vite_laire: never use reserved word as variable name
 JFB:&#160;:-D
 Merci_A_Vie_vite_laire: im dev and using reserved word as var name can be a problem to find your var or name an other var with the same type
 Geras: Giving Tipps in World chat and writing profanities in De Chat. Must be fun.
 JFB: I know. But if sb ask me the question is better to use in solution variables he defined in question. Letter we can discuss do question is correct and how to change it&#160;:-)
 Merci_A_Vie_vite_laire: Ye real
 jacek: goto is reserved in java, but no goto in java&#160;:(
 JFB:&#160;:-) sb just hated 'goto' so reserved it in Java&#160;;-)
 BenjaminUrquhart: on my way to bytecode patch my variable names to reserved names in java
 BenjaminUrquhart: I think there's obfuscators that do that actually
 Geras: It was a feature that has been removed, there are still labels that can be used, but tbh in my 17 years as dev I have yet to encounter a "good" usage of labels. Most of the time it can be replaced by something more readable.
 jacek: i hate using bools if i want to break outer loop in inner loop
 JFB: BenjaminUrquhart - probably your right. It looks as good obfuscation strategy  
 BenjaminUrquhart: is this what we've come to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/632390344">https://www.codingame.com/replay/632390344</a>
 Geras: jacek if you really need to break the outer loop you can have a look at labels. I would advise against it, but the feature is out there for a quick solution.
 jacek: i know of it. at work i used it only once. i use it more in kotlin

 BenjaminUrquhart: thank you, I needed that video
 BenjaminUrquhart: looks like I'll be joining spider yeet gang then
 BenjaminUrquhart: was hoping it wouldn't come to that
 JFB: BenjaminUrquhart - if your hero 5 used "WIND" in step 66 - you will win
 JFB: Is jus such simple
 BenjaminUrquhart: you sure?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'll tell you right now it cast wind
 JFB: It depend do monster 44 in in hero 5 wind range. If it is in wind range - wictory is yours
 BenjaminUrquhart: doens't look like it was
 BenjaminUrquhart: cause it was reacting to the opponent hero and not the spider
 BenjaminUrquhart: and the opponent was pushed back
 BenjaminUrquhart: just not the spider
 BenjaminUrquhart: anyway I have to go for now
 JFB: OK. So it is not range. So control on the one of the opponent heros in 65 will give your win
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't run a simulation to figure that out
 BenjaminUrquhart: although I could maybe see about adding protection for certain cases like these
 BenjaminUrquhart: I could totally just cast shield on the spider lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: anyway yeah I need sleep
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: helloooooo
 JFB: Any way - I use salmon strategy too so I know that your best strategy was to direct hero 5  to opponent in step 59 and following and use control na at least one of oppo heros as soon as you in range
 JFB: BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: meh
 salmon: My bot also needs many improvements. It shouldn't kill monster 51.

 Salticid: Is there any information about the missing entries in the Spider Attack leaderboard? Should I just resubmit, or will the remaining entries to the contest be added eventually?
 BenjaminUrquhart: [CG]Thibaud — Today at 3:57 AMthere was an issue during copy. The arena is not ready yet
 Salticid: Great, thank you for confirming that it's a known issue.&#160;:)
 salmon: ups, I've resubmitted 
 JFB: And BenjaminUrquhart - it looks that your bots "think" that 38 is the danger to your base. It is not. But probably input data, wrongly, say that it is. Input data state that monster will reach a base - but it is not.
 BenjaminUrquhart: which frame
 BenjaminUrquhart: nvm I see it
 JFB: 64 and following
 Maxyme_Bonvent: Hello, World
 JFB: salmon - so when you resubmited your bots - you received points promotion in the game, right?
 salmon: right
 BenjaminUrquhart: @JFB that doesn't seem to be the case, I think it goes for it because I don't check if it will exit the arena before targeting
 JFB: If your bot will be automatically copied to the game from contest - you will not receive such points , so resubmition was good move&#160;:-)
 salmon: I did not know that :D
 tangent0: System.out.println(res.substring(0, res.length()-1));
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice
 BenjaminUrquhart: anyway I need to depart for real
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 Maxyme_Bonvent: good bye&#160;!
 BenjaminUrquhart: I shall become one with the yeet probably tomorrow

 VictoriousTriceraton: Greetings everyone! Can somebody check my contribution for approval, please? I need one more approve to publish puzzle.
 Geras: I can't approve, but as a little note, in your Goal section you seperate the "-" and "|" with a slash, and in the next line you seperate with a comma, which makes it hard to read, at least for me.
 5DN1L: You may leave a comment there
 Geras: Will do, thanks for the hint.

 eulerscheZahl: but he's more creative in German
 Geras: In a sense, yes.
 Uljahn: done
 EkipEkip: La masturbation dela bitta&#160;!
 yiermu: Difficult 
 Geras: Well, no sleep for the mods today.
 Ayza: seems like the case
 Ayza: too many troll accounts
 jacek: :neutral_face:
 eulerscheZahl: banning is still faster than creating a new account. but more spammers than mods
 Uljahn: guess CG should hire full time mods, not just some volunteers :disappointed:
 jacek:             if (i&#160;!= action) continue;
 jacek: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: it's easier to simply remove the chat. so let's not complain
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather yell for mods a few times than lose it completely
 struct: Ill just make a script to ban them from all chats instead
 j4at: Trolls are not doing any significant damage tho.
 jacek: :blush:
 Westicles: I wonder if I give them an invite I'll get that influencer badge
 Westicles: achievement
 Q12: Uljahn You can automate this process by checking every message for curse and then warn the user, and if he curse again then automatically ban him
 jacek: balls
 jacek: oh
 j4at: Auto ban is dangerous
 j4at: auto mute instead&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there is no mute
 j4at: add it&#160;?
 Q12: not if you warn him once j4at
 eulerscheZahl: there is kick which lets you come back on page reload
 struct: I dont warn new accounts
 struct: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: adding features to the chat? that's absolutely ludicrous

 j4at: haha
 Westicles: seems like the euros are less uptight about swearing than the NA mods

 eulerscheZahl: only those with 300+ clashes can delete thre
 Astrobytes: they did that before
 Astrobytes: 5D sorted it
 Astrobytes: apparently these people are quite persistent
 eulerscheZahl: even robin hood got bored and gave up
 eulerscheZahl: even MK
 Astrobytes: lol, MK still pops up on the discord every so often
 Astrobytes: on here, less so
 eulerscheZahl: i'm immune to discord
 Astrobytes: you're in harmony with discord?
 eulerscheZahl: just the CG discord annoyed me. when a message gets deleted, it still shows an unread and won't disappear without a lot of random clicking
 Astrobytes: that's a discord problem in general tbh
 eulerscheZahl: but CG discord has the spamming problem
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I still only have external contests unmuted so not an issue
 Astrobytes: well, other than during the contest
 eulerscheZahl: any comments on that channel that are worth reading?
 Astrobytes: Nope.
 eulerscheZahl: see, i did the right thing

 IvesL: i would say its not correct
 IvesL: it also includes datetime, sys, math
 j4at: those are builtin
 IvesL: oh
 eulerscheZahl: perl libraries :DList::Util, List::MoreUtils
 IvesL: do you guys know the shortest way to have all inputs in a list in python?
 IvesL: like a = input(), b= input(), l =[a,b]
 eulerscheZahl: isn't there a file containing the input?
 Westicles: open(0)&#160;?
 IvesL: i remember i see someone omitting the "input()"
 wlesavo: arr = [input() for i in range(2)]
 eulerscheZahl: but what if the number of lines is dynamic?
 j4at: a,b=open(0)
 j4at: works with dynamic number of lines
 IvesL: yea should be sth with open
 wlesavo: in range(dynamic_n) :smiley:
 Uljahn: also i=input;a=i();b=i()
 eulerscheZahl: i('answer')
 Uljahn: yep
 j4at: i=input is only useful when you use 3 or more times
 CasualCoder123: remember, string d = cde.substring(1, 2);
 j4at: you can use input to print too. But will block you can use only for the last print
 CasualCoder123: the output will change depending on your last imput
 IvesL: it is usually a problem to me in shortest mode
 CasualCoder123: huh
 IvesL: for multiple inputs like int(input())
 CasualCoder123: copy and paste
 IvesL: what i can do is just I=int, N=input, I(N())
 CasualCoder123: yup.
 IvesL: until i see someone using like open in a one liner
 IvesL: even shorter
 IvesL: but i forgot how he did that
 Westicles: wow, look at all the guys with double xp/cp on the missing accounts
 mehdilhy: Is is possible to customize custom clash of codes parties 
 mehdilhy: the exercices part
 eulerscheZahl: what do you mean by "customize"?
 IvesL: hover over clash of code, top right corner 3dots -&gt; launch a private clash
 mehdilhy: I know there are some exercices that are made by codingame stuff , besite the community exercices
 mehdilhy: they have black color in them 
 mehdilhy: And they are easier to solve and can be translated depending on the language choosen in the website
 mehdilhy: so is it possible to only have those kind of exercices in a private clash&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: are they really by staff and not just old?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not aware of such a feature to select the task
 mehdilhy: Yes that's what i see ... 
 mehdilhy: thank you anyways
 mehdilhy: have an amazing day&#160;!
 StevenV: hello guys, which language should I learn for code of clash?
 Wontonimo: one that you like.  seriously.
 Wontonimo: don't play clash to get highest on clash.  play it to practice your language of choice

 Wontonimo: wdym struct?

 StevenV: thanks
 StevenV: I will try standard MCTS at weekend
 StevenV: fall2020 is the first contest on CG for me, so I really want to be in legend for it
 jacek: have you dont MCTS before?
 jacek: its simultaneous moves game, may not be good for first MCTS. though there is not much interaction between players there

 waterproofsodium: 150th
 VizGhar: DeadlyPyke why uttt? you pretty much have to simulate whole game in order to make it work
 waterproofsodium: this just became stress&#160;:(
 DeadlyPyke: so what kind of ttt should i do?
 jacek: wood league of uttt is normal tic tac toe
 DeadlyPyke: how do i start?
 DeadlyPyke:&#160;:|
 DeadlyPyke: it's confusing to me
 Uljahn: start by learning the basics of a language of your choice
 DeadlyPyke: already done that
 DeadlyPyke: c#
 DeadlyPyke: what I'm confused about are the turns?
 DeadlyPyke: how do i explain this
 DeadlyPyke: um
 Uljahn: solve some easy puzzles with hints, like Power of Thor episode 1
 DeadlyPyke: ok
 DeadlyPyke: thanks
 jacek: so you are confused about input/output and while loop
 DeadlyPyke: pretty much
 DeadlyPyke: like how do i use opponentRow and opponentCol variable
 DeadlyPyke: if the grid was a table
 DeadlyPyke: would it be 1 on top left
 DeadlyPyke: and then 2 and then 3
 DeadlyPyke:&#160;?

 jacek: yes, but it starts from 0
 jacek: so 0 0 is opponent made move (X or O) in left top cell
 DeadlyPyke: ah ok
 DeadlyPyke: so it's 0 1 2

 struct: ...
 Link_jon: 1,890 turns is short?
 struct: sorry sarcasm
 jacek: 189
 struct: my bot is just rand()&#160;% actions.size()
 VizGhar: OK guys... I want to successfully implement MCTS. It doesnt have to necesarilly be something on CG. I failed with UTTT, so I want something small just to play with it
 Link_jon: ... w... wuht...
 noValve: hey guys
 noValve: hyd?
 struct: VizGhar I first did it with normal TTT
 struct: Because you can fully solve it there
 VizGhar: tnx
 jacek: connect 4? breakthrough?
 struct: There are like 500k states+-
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:?
 jacek: at most 19683 states or 362880 game tree
 struct: Yes and no
 Link_jon: 5-- erm. mhm okay... cant you shrink skope down to small scenarios. like looking at only 9 cells at a time in all areas; like how one would in minesweeper?
 Link_jon: scope*
 struct: I think that is with symmetry jacek
 jacek: its upper limit with impossible states. 3^9 and 9!
 struct: 549945 positions
 struct: my minimax with no pruning
 jacek: and per <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple/blob/main/README.md">https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple/blob/main/README.md</a> there are 5478 legal positions
 struct: You can see articles mentioning this number
 jacek: wtf
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4176481/3122936">https://stackoverflow.com/a/4176481/3122936</a>
 jacek: hmm, but at most you can get 9! moves
 BuggyAl: can you retake a certification test if you fail it?
 Uljahn: yes
 BuggyAl: k ty
 struct: idk jacek

 struct: Quidome yes I am
 struct: also gonna get promoted from wood 1 wtihout touching my code
 struct: :p
 LaurensD: justice has been served
 Quidome: yes, nice, I was a little bit to early got kicked by you
 struct: It seems like an interesting game
 Quidome: do a resubmit now probably enough
 Quidome: looks good indeed
 Quidome: I mean the game, it is interesting
 struct: yeah I understood
 Quidome: the legend guys seems to have the same strategy
 struct: Havent watched them yet
 struct: I dont even know how to code a bot for this
 Quidome: collect enough gold and launch a one turn attack
 Quidome: that looks a little bit buggy to me in son't know al te=he rules yet maybe there is a reasonable defense
 Quidome: (I don't know all the rules yet)
 struct: Yeah this is why I wanted to skip wood
 struct: but its not possible
 struct: I just coded a monte carlo instead
 waterproofsodium: how do you increase your rank?
 struct: waterproofsodium play anything on the compete tab
 waterproofsodium: doesnt involve clash?
 Quidome: You used MC to get into wood 1
 struct: clashes have a limit of 5k points
 Quidome:&#160;?
 struct: To get bronze I guess
 struct: Im getting promoted again
 Quidome: Ir looks like heuristics is doing it for this game
 waterproofsodium: hm clash is in compete tab
 waterproofsodium: but I won some and my rank doesnt go up
 struct: rank updates once a day
 Quidome: just like the last spring challenge
 waterproofsodium: i see
 struct: Maybe
 struct: Maybe its a mix of both
 struct: search + heuristics
 Quidome: there is already search for one move 
 Quidome: spend all your gold and see where it get's you
 struct: brb
 Quidome: yep I am gonna be promoted as well&#160;:)
 Synergyforge: I can't ever seem to really get search algos to click in my head.  :(  I'm not a real dev.
 5DN1L: Try double-click?
 Synergyforge: hurda-hurda
 waterproofsodium: my pod racer so pro
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: is ti mad
 jzen: ice ten food
 waterproofsodium: oh getting bellow place 1k with podracer :D
 DeadlyPyke: hey i have a question
 DeadlyPyke: is it randomly decided who starts in uttt arena?
 CasualCoder123: string d = cde.substring(1, 2); duh
 5DN1L: no spam please CasualCoder123
 5DN1L: you post that again and i'll kick you out
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 DeadlyPyke: 👀 
 CasualCoder123: um
 Quidome: jacek are you active playing ice and fire atm
 Quidome:&#160;?
 CasualCoder123: how is that a scam?
 CasualCoder123: thats just an active string
 jzen: *spam
 CasualCoder123: haha thanks
 Quidome: struct just entered bronze&#160;:) I am almost there
 struct: nice
 CasualCoder123: niiice
 5DN1L: you've repeated that "string d" line a few times, CasualCoder123, that counts as a spam
 Link_jon: okay im completely confused as to what is going wrong
 Link_jon: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff650853-47f6-405c-a9bc-dc2a3ac4e901">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff650853-47f6-405c-a9bc-dc2a3ac4e901</a>
 Link_jon: someone else look at this
 Link_jon: cuz ive been looking at it for the past hour lul
 Link_jon: Notably the for loop to setup the players.set tables from the winners is probably whats going wrong but i cant tell
 struct: Maybe ill get silver Quidome
 struct: :p
 Quidome: that would be cool, just entered brinze
 DeadlyPyke: what does the validActionCount variable do exactly in uttt?
 Quidome: I see you are already above the boss, nice!
 Quidome: going smooth for you!
 struct: number of valid actions
 DeadlyPyke: so like, if i put down an x and then the opponent put down an o,since there's 7 box left validationcount gonna be equal to 2?
 DeadlyPyke: 7?*
 struct: yes
 struct: but on later game it is not normal tic tac toe anymore
 struct: thats why it can be usefull
 waterproofsodium: i got too tired to solve any problems now
 waterproofsodium: i hate this :p
 Meep1307: :tired_face:
 Quidome: come on struct get out, I am already at position 2
 Quidome: And above the boss :grinning:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what lang is that Link_jon?
 natorius6: taco
 struct: Quidome are you using heuristics?
 Quidome: yep
 Quidome: only
 Quidome: a very greedy one
 Quidome: hm I am getting to tired, have to stop I am breaking stuff now
 wlesavo: oh you doing coif
 wlesavo: legend is quite hard there
 Quidome: it was easy sailing to silver
 Quidome: 4 hours or something
 wlesavo: i think for legend you need at least some variation of fatality and/or some good cuts 
 Quidome: what do you mean by that?
 struct: mine is just MC on unfinished sim
 struct: 100 iterations
 struct: or something
 wlesavo: Quidome deep lines to enemy base 
 wlesavo: in single turn
 Quidome: aha, yes i observed that behaviour
 Quidome: not there yet&#160;:)
 struct: do you use bitboards wlesavo?
 Quidome: can you defend against that strategy
 wlesavo: but the stable defence is more important i think, the finisher itself is easy
 wlesavo: struct no, i had some python heuristics with simple searches for fatality etc
 lllllllllnasdfjwhjds: xxxxx
 wlesavo: Quidome you can delay it while preparing your own attack
 Quidome: With towers?
 Quidome: just got those rules gonna look tomorrow
 wlesavo: you probably need to check finishers for your opponent as well, and build towers on this route
 Quidome: aha yes, thnxs
 wlesavo: but the game is quite deep
 Quidome: Because of the one turn long attack I was wondering if it was a broken game
 struct: So I cant get legend with rand? o.o
 Quidome: OK, now nicely above the bronze boss, just have to wait...
 Quidome: fixed a minor bug :P
 wlesavo: struct i think just mc is not enough, but it could be good for general strategy, idk
 lesageduvillage: hello guys, i have a technical interview tommorow for an internship what is the best exercice to perfect my c skills&#160;? 
 wlesavo: struct are you doing multiple builds in one turn in MC im not sure how would i include that type of moves
 struct: My MC only knows wood 2 rules
 struct: so no building
 Quidome: OK, I am in silver also
 Quidome: continue tomorrow
 Quidome: good night
 wlesavo: gn
 Angers: what is a good step after mad pod racing (silver) for another activity for a somewhat noob? Every one I look at seems to start with so much it's a bit overwhelming
 struct: try some board game
 VizGhar: I'd recommend learning BFS on any puzzle
 MrAnderson: Cyborg Uprising has a pretty low barrier to entry
 waterproofsodium: pod racer fine tuned xD
 waterproofsodium: making it slowing down before the next checkpoint depending on speed and distance
 waterproofsodium: don't know what else can be improved with the current data
 jacek: bronze?
 waterproofsodium: wood
 jacek: angle &lt; -90 or &gt; 90 trick?
 waterproofsodium: it seems a bit pointless. I already feel I'm a cheap neural network
 waterproofsodium: that was the thing I added the first 5 min
 waterproofsodium: then did Sqrt on it to give it more spicyness
 waterproofsodium: hm seem to get on place 5 now xD
 waterproofsodium: idk what temporary places mean, it shows place 2 now tho lol
 jacek: it still calculating fights
 waterproofsodium: still wondering why it pushes me up to low ranks tho
 waterproofsodium: last time I got from 1000 back to over 2000
 waterproofsodium: hey jacek how did you get out of low leagues?
 waterproofsodium: I have no idea for any other optimization. I told you all 3 things I am doing. also boost seems to always work great
 jacek: waterproofsodium youre above the boss in ranking. wait till it finishes battles in arena and it will promote you
 waterproofsodium: sure sure
 jacek: there is only 1 boost available. you want to use it when you are far from checkpoint
 waterproofsodium: I'm just curious how low leagues already requires 3 optimizations
 waterproofsodium: yeah i mean.. that's exactly how i did it
 waterproofsodium: far away and at right angle &lt; 10 degrees
 waterproofsodium: but
 waterproofsodium: that's 4 optimizations already
 waterproofsodium: in "wood league"
 7Adieu: do you guys have very long time to wait when you submit for IA races&#160;?
 waterproofsodium: I feel like I may have missed something because I required 4 optimizations to get out of wood league
 jacek: and youre in bronze :tada:
 waterproofsodium: yes yes ty
 waterproofsodium: still tell me wether I have missed something? xD
 jacek: 7Adieu you jsut have to wait to finish all the battles
 jacek: depending on game it can be 90 to 200
 jacek: waterproofsodium you can try fiddling with thrust depending on distance
 waterproofsodium: again. I did that already
 jacek: there is also a trick: print target checkpoint - 3 * velocity of your pod
 waterproofsodium: so counting 4 optimizations in total
 waterproofsodium: what's the criteria to get to next league?
 jacek: be above the boss in leadeboard ^_^
 waterproofsodium: what's the criteria to be above rank x in leaderboard?&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: probably some score based on win/loss?
 jacek: its trueskill algorithm. if youre familiar with elo system, this is something similar
 waterproofsodium: i'm even familiar with trueskill
 jacek: you get more point if you win vs higher player
 jacek: oh my
 struct: o.o
 waterproofsodium: ok so ig next optimization would be to try to kick other players out of the game with boost&#160;:&gt;
 waterproofsodium: cause I can think of nothing else
 waterproofsodium: it'd be also possible to map the race once one lap is done tho
 waterproofsodium: and work intelligently with that
 struct: yes
 struct: you should do that
 struct: on later leagues all checkpoints are given at the start
 waterproofsodium: hm wait
 waterproofsodium: I should do excess work now?
 struct: well if you do it
 struct: you get promoted to silver
 struct: or you can just use checkpoint_x - 3 * vx
 waterproofsodium: yeah but it is annoying to do
 struct: So you get gold and then code the sim from there
 struct: If thats what you are interested in
 struct: if you keep track of velocity you can do this
 waterproofsodium: strange this formula shall work
 waterproofsodium: where does it come from?
 waterproofsodium: forum?
 struct: I saw it on chat
 struct: and its mentioned a lot
 waterproofsodium: maybe that's why I need for optimizations to get out of wood ..
 waterproofsodium: *four
 waterproofsodium: btw I already had vel in place
 waterproofsodium: I used it to slow down before reaching the cp
 struct: for wood you only need to follow the tutorial
 struct: also for some reason -3vx cant beat wood2 or wood1 boss
 struct: cant remeber which
 waterproofsodium: I wouldn't have guessed that changing the target position would have any relevance without knowing the next next cp position
 waterproofsodium: huh?
 waterproofsodium: the formula gets you past bronze
 waterproofsodium: but not out of wood?
 waterproofsodium: that is very strange
 struct: yes
 waterproofsodium: maybe it bumps into you at every curve
 waterproofsodium: one did that 3 times in a race to me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sumbitch... working on Sliding Maze Puzzle... everything works up until testcase 4 189 steps....at Depth 12 of BFS...I'm missing a valid player move and don't have a big enough log file:rage:
 struct: even locally PatrickMcGinnisII?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah didn't move it locally yet, i figured out a way to track it ... but I have to check every depth 11 gamestate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least there's only 23 of them
 waterproofsodium: to be good at pod racer I figured social engineering is my best bet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Imma go mow the lawn or something, glhf
 waterproofsodium: does someone have email of current #1 rank?
 waterproofsodium: wanna ask for some code :p
 struct: top 4 is NN
 waterproofsodium: why do I do clash of code at 1 am
 waterproofsodium: i got first yay
 HenroLST: hi
 struct: hi
 gearhead: hello
 fcil: hiii
 waterproofsodium: so a test didn't work although I had exactly correct output
 waterproofsodium: how can that happen..
 waterproofsodium: output was
 waterproofsodium: 1 2 3
 waterproofsodium: 2 2 3
 fcil: hmmm
 waterproofsodium: found:2 2 3\n
 waterproofsodium: expected: Nothing
 HenroLST: ah
 HenroLST: the \n
 HenroLST: probably didnt want it?
 waterproofsodium: that's nice for the test
 waterproofsodium: but that's kinda the tests failure
 HenroLST: hey i found you
 waterproofsodium: aha
 waterproofsodium: hm
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey waterproofsodium, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 waterproofsodium: gimme more
 waterproofsodium: I'm already top 3% with  12k score? :D
 ycsvenom: it's easy to get that from the first 6 hours try to get 6k or less :smiley:
 waterproofsodium: hrmpf
 waterproofsodium: define "easy"
 waterproofsodium: I would bet to you that if I find 10 random people on the street 8 would not be able to achieve that in 6 hours lol
 ycsvenom: lmgtfu "defemination of easy"
 Westicles: lmgtfy a b
 antiwonto: [auto] try 'lmgtfy [username] search'
 waterproofsodium: hm
 waterproofsodium: seriously how "easy"
 waterproofsodium: are you talking about people who were programming for years before?
 waterproofsodium: and if this is easy what is the difficult part?
 Westicles: im14andthisisdeep
 waterproofsodium:&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: btw I'm just asking to plan ahead
 ycsvenom: i am saying you got to 12k because all people are just registering and don't bother to come back
 ycsvenom: i am just saying to keep going upand never gone down
 waterproofsodium: :thumbsup:

 FBF_Luis: which one?
 Thorcode: yes
 FBF_Luis: oh lol, by "thor code" I thought he meant the thor problem
 Thorcode: bruh
 FBF_Luis: my apologies kind sir
 Thorcode: raizbro always looking for me
 Thorcode: np
 Uljahn: guess i should ban some guys for constant offtopic
 Thorcode: no&#160;:( plz don't ban me
 FBF_Luis: thanks for the follow thor&#160;:)
 Thorcode: Thor will find a way to beat the cat in someday
 Uljahn: you'd better to start now or i'll die by that time
 Thorcode: yeah I'm gonna reach reCurse level
 Thorcode: rank
 Thorcode: to beat the cat
 Thorcode: Wait and see
 Uljahn: nah, you'll be distracted by the chat and achieve nothing&#160;:)
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: I'm learning the book python cookbook and solving puzle to win bot contest
 BlaiseEbuth: Too late. No more bot contests
 Thorcode:&#160;? it still has fall challenge
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 derjack: fail challenge
 Thorcode: or contest
 Uljahn: it's not a bot contest, but escape room

 [CG]Thibaud: speaking of yourself BlaiseEbuth&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm waiting.
 [CG]Thibaud: I know. You'll get it eventually
 Astrobytes: Hi astro I'm Uljahn
 eulerscheZahl: mocking the illiterate toad?
 Astrobytes: would I do such a thing... :innocent:
 eulerscheZahl: at least I got the kind of animal right: a cat
 eulerscheZahl: so i'm ready to enter elementary school
 Astrobytes: small steps :D
 Rium: is there any way to see all of the puzzles i have solved previously?
 eulerscheZahl: just scroll to the bottom of the puzzle list
 Astrobytes: scroll down on the puzzle page, completed ones will be at the bottom
 Astrobytes: grr
 eulerscheZahl: i'm learning fast. now even speed typing. middle school here I come
 Astrobytes: :D
 Rium: thanks guys
 Astrobytes: np
 LagunaElectric: Morning, boys&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: afternoon!
 Astrobytes: ouch
 [CG]Thibaud: enough is enough
 Astrobytes: Just catching up on the fr conversation
 Astrobytes: Was definitely pushing his luck
 darkhorse64: blaise has been kicked&#160;?
 LagunaElectric: f
 Astrobytes: oui
 Astrobytes: Banned, actually.
 RyanRD: yo philippe
 LagunaElectric: trying to make the brainfuck interpreter in python and it wants a array of bytes. When I look up byte arrays in python, it gives me things that look like "/x00" when I expected "0000". 
 Limonade: yo bro
 Limonade: what's up my frerot
 darkhorse64: Wow&#160;! I think nobody should take was he says too seriously. He is playing a satanic character
 darkhorse64: was -&gt; what
 LagunaElectric: Still, if it was disruptive, they should have scaled it back a bit
 Astrobytes: True for the most part, but deliberately winding up Tibo isn't gonna get you far is it
 eulerscheZahl: he played it a little too well and got several warnings. us regulars know how to handle him but he does the same to new users
 Uljahn: guess it's better to leave the site you don't find appealing anymore than to play a toxic troll
 LagunaElectric: ^
 Astrobytes: And it's not a good look for the site as euler is saying
 darkhorse64: Irony through the chat is difficult to tune 
 [CG]Thibaud: there are limits, he crossed them several times on purpose, and got warned for it
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: even warned with a ban earlier
 1rre: @lagunaelectric I see your problem, you're using Python&#160;:)
 LagunaElectric: Oh is that it?
 [CG]Thibaud: I've been way too lenient
 LagunaElectric: I could try in C#, maybe?
 1rre: Eh anything should work but any sort of interpreter in Python (or JS really) is tricky as the dynamic typing can screw with stuff under the hood
 darkhorse64: I found his YT hilarious but I understand that the "targets" may have been pissed off
 1rre: That's not to say it's impossible, you've just got to be more careful when writing it
 Uljahn: i didn't get why "it wants a array of bytes"
 Astrobytes: Sure. I take no issue with humour, but he knew he was playing with fire by saying the things he was in public, especially in front of T
 LagunaElectric: Yea, I could probably wrap an array in a class with custom methods to handle accessing it, but I'm getting confused on the byte array. I'm wondering if I can just use ints ðŸ¤”
 1rre: I mean the array of bytes is basically a processed string
 Ognjen: Any super obvious way to optimize MTCS? I'm doing Ultimate tic tac toe and for now I can only get around 1k simulations per turn (in the later game it goes upto 3k)? Before I start looking at stuff like UCB
 Uljahn: Ognjen: use C++ with pragmas
 Ognjen: I am using C++, sorry
 1rre: Wait dm on the bytes
 Ognjen: What pragmas?
 1rre: It's limiting the value to 255
 LagunaElectric: yes
 1rre: just make an int wrapper
 Ognjen: stuff like #pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")?
 darkhorse64: Although I share his concerns, I think that a slap in the face is not a good manner to communicate with people
 1rre: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3ddc513-e5ab-4164-a83c-84c590b78e50">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3ddc513-e5ab-4164-a83c-84c590b78e50</a>

 1rre: or just (x + 1) &amp; 255
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: Yes, there is a way to conduct yourself
 Astrobytes: Ognjen: check the link I posted, forgot to tag you 
 Ognjen: Thank you very much, will look into it
 1rre: Wait no overflow, I'm just reading the spec now sorry
 Astrobytes: Also, keep your node sizes small, avoid use of new and delete when creating children (use a pool of preallocated nodes for instance)
 darkhorse64: ^
 darkhorse64: do not keep the game state in your nodes
 darkhorse64: better replay the moves
 Obizwan: Hello, I am having issues with a loop,Do I need to import the max() function in Python for it to work or is it already in the base python?
 darkhorse64: profile your code, too
 Astrobytes: ^^^ this
 Uljahn: Obizwan: make sure you don't have the variable named max
 darkhorse64: put your wincheck on a small grid into a lookup table, use a bitboard to represent the small grid and use it to directly check the win in your lookup
 Ognjen: Well, the optimization pragmas definitely increased my simulation by a TON, thank you. Unfortunately my algorithm is still dumb :D I'll try to find what I might've missed it. Thanks a lot for these suggestions
 Astrobytes: watch out for sign errors, in your backprop etc
 liboy129: yes
 LagunaElectric: 1rre no worries, I appreciate the advice&#160;:)
 LagunaElectric: Is the sync with external editor feature any good? Asking cuz it's in beta and wondering if any of you have used it
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's fine
 Astrobytes: works great!
 miszu: is there a c++ equivalent of this?
 miszu: the only thing I can think of is writing as 2 separate instructions
 ProCoder03: Is it working for you Astrobytes, I use edge chromium and it is not working for me :confused:
 darkhorse64: have a static array&#160;?
 darkhorse64: static int sizes[4] = {0, SIZE - 1, SIZE * (SIZE - 1), 0};
 darkhorse64: int targetStart = sizes[dir];
 miszu: darkhorse64 yeah that's what I will do
 Ognjen: Holy mother of God, 500% simulation count increase just by adding pragmas, insane
 darkhorse64: This is going to be your easiest improvement in UTTT
 Ognjen: Well yeah, I was looking for something not too complicated
 Ognjen: Because UCB is still over my head :D
 Ognjen: I see you are very high up on the leaderboard, how many sims would you say your AI does each turn?
 Nerchio: cant wait for fall challenge 2021
 Nerchio: kappa
 LagunaElectric: python won't let me split on ""
 LagunaElectric: ðŸ¤”
 Uljahn: why?
 Stilgart: Ognjen: you should improve your game engine
 Stilgart: and pre-compute as much stuff as possible
 Stilgart: and ESCROLL
 darkhorse64: Ognjen: around 100k second turn
 LagunaElectric: ah, i needed to do list(string_thing)
 LagunaElectric: that's pretty handy, actually
 Stilgart: 25-28k per turn here
 miszu: doing the 2048 game now
 miszu: the sims is actually easy to code for once
 unthinkable: in a function can you do&#160;: int logic(intboard[][], int row[], int col[]
 Stilgart: this should not work in C
 unthinkable: int logic (int board[ ] [ ], int row [ ], int col [ ])
 unthinkable: im using cpp
 unthinkable: there is an errow on the second array bracket of board
 Stilgart: yep
 unthinkable: why is that
 unthinkable: "array has incomplete element type int"
 Stilgart: when you use an array, C/C++ needs to know the size of a element in your array
 unthinkable: oh ty
 Stilgart: int row[] ---&gt; elements are ints, so sizeof(int), all is nice
 Stilgart: int board[][] ---&gt; elements are "board[]" ---&gt; fail
 Stilgart: oops
 Stilgart: are "int[]" 
 Stilgart: we do not know its size
 Stilgart: you might try something like this&#160;:
 Stilgart: int logic(int w, int h, int board[w][h], ... )
 unthinkable: can I just do board[3][3]
 Ghally: if you are not sure about the size of the array you can use vector
 unthinkable: oh yes
 unthinkable: but can you just give the array a size
 Stilgart: if you know the exact size, give it and you will be fine
 unthinkable: i give it and it says error
 unthinkable: btw those values are being passed in\
 unthinkable: not declared
 unthinkable: oh
 unthinkable: nvm
 unthinkable: I got it
 unthinkable: thank you for your help

 Ksush_eli: sorry
 Marginaltub98: hello. I'm new to programming
 Uljahn: i guess you'd better know the basics to practice here comfortably
 1rre: use scala
 1rre: scala &gt;&gt; python&#160;:)
 1rre: exept for the delay when you're testing on cg
 1rre: annoyingly
 Uljahn: also except for code golf
 1rre: true
 1rre: but then ruby &gt; python
 1rre: also bash sometimes
 1rre: but only rarely
 Marginaltub98: ok then
 Wontonimo: hey Marginaltub98 , what do you know about coding?
 Wontonimo: and what programming language are you interested in?
 MSmits: hey guys
 Wontonimo: :wave: MSmits
 Marginaltub98: I know only a little bit, and I want to learn, python, C, C++, and javascript (im starting with that)
 MSmits: Does anyone know if the escape contest counts for any leaderboard ranks? Like contests? Or if you get cp?
 Wontonimo: don't know
 Wontonimo: do you know about loops, arrays, and functions Marginaltub98?
 struct: cg did say no coding points
 MSmits: ah then it will probably not affect the leaderboards.
 Uljahn: "The Finish in the top X, in any contest and Finish in the top X in a language ranking, in any contest achievements can't be unlocked during this event. Also, this challenge won't count for the contest leaderboard."
 MSmits: great, I am out then. Not complaining mind you. I hope people have a lot of fun doing this. But I'll stick with multis&#160;:)
 Uljahn: same
 MSmits: can i unregister for this?
 VizGhar:&#160;:) understandable
 Wontonimo: nope :D
 Marginaltub98: I know a little about functions, but not much. Mostly, I've been doing block coding before this.
 Uljahn: delete acc :smiley:

 MSmits: lol ok.
 Benji-the-scripter: Hello =)
 Benji-the-scripter: =D
 LagunaElectric: Hello :D
 LagunaElectric: I'm trying to figure out bracket matching for the brainfuck interpreter&#160;:)
 Benji-the-scripter:&#160;?? Dont know what it is
 Ognjen: Any smarter more optimized way of checking for 3 in a row in UTTT? Other than literally checking rows with 1 loop, columns 1 loop, diagonals with basic if?
 Wontonimo: yes, bitboard operations
 Wontonimo: so, if you convert the minboard to a bitmask
 darkhorse64: even better lookup tables
 Wontonimo: 001 010 100 for example, then you can look it up
 Wontonimo: there are only 512
 Wontonimo: you only need to check if the last player who moved wins for miniboards
 darkhorse64: Wontonimo: my bot is a heuristic one, 100 LOC
 Ognjen: so encode every state within a single int?
 Wontonimo: yeah, here is something that may help you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a>
 Ognjen: At the moment, my board contains 4 different types of values, not-played, X owns it, O owns it, not-available
 Ognjen: Do you reckon switching to a bitboard would be possible?
 darkhorse64: I would never thought I could beat a MCTS with such a simple thing
 Wontonimo: oh man darkhorse64, my mcts got beat by a heuristic&#160;!  wow
 jacek: what game
 Wontonimo: counting tictactoe
 darkhorse64: not beaten, wrecked 
 Wontonimo: it is in the contribution section
 Wontonimo: yeah, wrecked is right
 darkhorse64: :stuck_out_tongue:
 <b>**Wontonimo tips hat</b></p><p><img src="/a/63052365393434" /> jacek: oh my
 darkhorse64: maybe you have a bug or my heuristic does something that messes your pruning
 Wontonimo: or maybe your heuristic is way better than mine.  as mine is more like UTC with heuristic.  The MC is very constrained, so it is more like an eval.
 darkhorse64: You are in your own league now&#160;?
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: oh, i guess i am.  i'm switching back now
 TimothyAlexisVass: Any way to do this easier? (JavaScript)

 TimothyAlexisVass: s is a string...
 TimothyAlexisVass: a will be an object with the count for each character
 ZarthaxX: i gues u can do it in 1 for instead of 2
 TimothyAlexisVass: Sure, but will it be easier? :D
 ZarthaxX: you just loop over string s and for each char you ask if it's already in the dictionary
 ZarthaxX: if it isnt you put 0
 ZarthaxX: and then you always increment
 ZarthaxX: it seems easy..
 ZarthaxX: your solution is not nice complexity wise
 ZarthaxX: you are iterating the string twice which is unnecessary
 Wontonimo: a={}; for (e of s) { a[e]= a[e]?a[e]+1:1 }
 ZarthaxX: idk if he wanted to codegolf tbh
 Wontonimo: it's just 1 line now
 ZarthaxX: should define what easy is
 ZarthaxX: but it's annoying to read :P

 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you Wontonimo
 TimothyAlexisVass: I wish you all a good evening!
 ZarthaxX: so you actually wanted a codegolfed solution
 ZarthaxX: :rolling_eyes:
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: in counting tic tac toe O is first?
 jacek: and when O is blue, first player is yellow o.O?
 jacek: oh, color is right
 jacek: confusing
 MSmits: yeah, right is not a color
 jacek: oO

 LagunaElectric: Why am I so lost just trying to handle looping in brainfuck&#160;;-;
 Wontonimo: hmm, it's such an easy language so that couldn't be it.
 LagunaElectric: I'm doing the interpreter activity&#160;:)
 LagunaElectric: Maybe I'm going about it wrong
 Kitis: Cheese
 Kitis: :cheese:
 LagunaElectric: I love that meme, tho
 LagunaElectric: Gotta put the cheese first for full effect
 LagunaElectric: ðŸ§€
 LagunaElectric: Cheese
 Kitis: You made my day&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: How is that in any way amusind and/or entertaining?
 Astrobytes: *amusing
 LagunaElectric: You don't know the meme?
 LagunaElectric: Cheese guy. He's got cheese&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No. I'm 39, I left behind such bollocks a long time ago.
 LagunaElectric: I'm 27, and you're never to old for a good chuckle :D
 Astrobytes: But it's not funny.
 Student.idontknowwhattoput: sure it is
 LagunaElectric: In this context, no, and surely not to you
 LagunaElectric: But we are attributing it to another piece of media which holds the actual source of humor for us
 Student.idontknowwhattoput: ok
 Student.idontknowwhattoput: i  just found this tab lol
 Astrobytes: Well, meme away I guess
 Kitis: :cheese:
 LagunaElectric: Plus, it's kinda hard to pull off full Fry and Laurie skits in a chat lol
 LagunaElectric: There's a beautiful simplicity in being able to chuckle at
 LagunaElectric: ðŸ§€
 LagunaElectric: Cheese
 Westicles: so now to be funny you just have to say cheese or kek?
 LagunaElectric: No no, I think we're getting carried away lol
 Westicles: this is the lamest generation ever
 LagunaElectric: Let's not start bashing generations over differences in humor
 LagunaElectric: We share a lot of similarities as well!
 Westicles: maybe second lamest to those powdered wig guys...
 LagunaElectric: lmao
 LagunaElectric: First there were one liners, now we have one word-ers. Haters gonna hate :P
 LagunaElectric: I never understood the wigs though
 Wontonimo: soon it will be 1 letterers
 Wontonimo: U
 Wontonimo: hahahah
 LagunaElectric: Nope, already got that too
 LagunaElectric: E
 Astrobytes: F

 Astrobytes: never got the e one
 LagunaElectric: Me e-ither&#160;;)
 Xlos: 
 LagunaElectric: What
 Xlos: Evolved humor
 LagunaElectric: Why does it allow to send whitespace messages?
 Xlos: It's not whitespace, it's a newline
 LagunaElectric: I mean i get the humor progression, 
 LagunaElectric: wtf
 Xlos: wait that is whitespace
 LagunaElectric: yea lmao
 Xlos: chat has dark bg so it's darkspace
 Astrobytes: dark chatter
 Westicles: are bulls and cows 2 validators random?
 Uljahn: partly
 Benji-the-scripter: Is it night at your countries, for me it is so good ningt
 Benji-the-scripter: night*
 Schwase: "random"
 Uljahn: as far as i know for your first attempt you'll get the same result of B&amp;C for specific validator, then the final number will be generated
 Westicles: oh, okay thanks that sounds kind of familiar
 Kitis: :cheese:
 jacek: maybe this counting tic tac toe is onto something. maybe finally ill try RAVE and its gonna work :v
 miszu: for beam search, what datastructure you use for the memory pool? Because you need to keep track of the lowest cost and the best score at same time
 darkhorse64: the score is a member of the node for me
 miszu: yeah but how you access in constant time which node is the worst?
 darkhorse64: you need to keep the best n nodes for beam search. In c++, std::nth_element does the job.
 darkhorse64: Why would you need the worst node&#160;?
 miszu: in beam search if the beam is full, you need to remove the worst node to put the new nodes
 darkhorse64: I don't do it like that. I expand the each kept node with each possible action and I keep the best ones
 darkhorse64: My pool is so big that I do not need to erase/replace nodes
 Astrobytes: oooOOOOooo :P 
 jacek: pool boy
 darkhorse64: :musical_score: the pool on the hill
 Astrobytes: beatles?
 darkhorse64: yep
 Kitis: Hi
 Kitis: :cheese:
 Kitis: :sunglasses:
 Kitis: COOL
 Astrobytes: Oh quit it will you
 darkhorse64: I tell ya. Don't mess with mods today
 MSmits: they make you sleep with the fishes
 MSmits: (in the pool)
 Astrobytes: :innocent:
 Kitis: Hi mod
 Astrobytes: You are already on thin ice. And don't expect a follow back
 Uljahn: you're still lvl3, is it your final form?
 darkhorse64: they drown ya in the pool
 Kitis: Srry
 Kitis: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: concrete :mans_shoe: :mans_shoe:
 Kitis: I'm in school srry. 7th period
 Kitis: almost done
 Astrobytes: At least waste your time doing puzzles not annoying us in here
 Kitis: I'm sorry king  Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Aw do one will ya
 Kitis:&#160;?
 Disrrupted: hi
 Kitis: hi
 Kitis: mods are on
 Kitis: Ill be right back ing like 30-40 min
 Astrobytes: Because that's the time that mods go off?
 Astrobytes: wtf
 Astrobytes: this chat is beyond comment sometimes
 miszu: for the 2048 optimization problem, is your score as heuristic enough to reach far?
 Astrobytes: Try it and see. Most are using some kind of search though
 Astrobytes: (often using the heuristics)
 miszu: was thinking of beam search but never did it before. In the vanilla beam search you keep searching until you find the end node. But not when there is time constraint for example
 Astrobytes: You can do this one offline I think (confirmation anyone?)
 EvanBoi: hi
 DomiKo: you can do it offline, but results won't be "top tier"
 Uljahn: ye, i mostly did it offline, compressed first parts (until 32k tile) of solutions like they do with NN weights, and then solve the remaining part online with some simple beamsearch
 Astrobytes: that makes sense
 Astrobytes: I've yet to write anything for it tbh
 Kitis: srry im back but I have to do my homework
 Astrobytes: Then DO YOUR HOMEWORK
 Kitis: ok sir astrobytes
 Sha_winter: Hi how are ya'll?
 Sha_winter: Can I just say how smelly mods socks are?
 Sha_winter: They smell like your mom.
 Kitis: Srry thats my brother
 Sha_winter: Sorry king Astrobytes.:pray:
 Darkkii: hello everyone
 Darkkii: :D
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: Don't do homework
 Thorcode: homework is ez
 C0DE_M0NK3Y: i
 C0DE_M0NK3Y: i
 Thorcode: how to rank up fast in coc?
 moronidan: hi 
 Kitis: My brother got banned from this chat lol!
 Kitis: SOMEONE UNBAN HIM PLEASE!! HE's the only on I talk to.
 Kitis: lol that was him
 Kitis: don't ban me tho
 Kitis: He autistic be nice
 Kitis: :slight_smile:
 Westicles: there is no unban
 Kitis: oh how odes he get unbaned
 Westicles: I don't think mods are capable of unban. 
 miszu: solve the sandman problem in polynomial time then he will get unbanned
 Kitis: wats that
 Thorcode: are you sure?
 Kitis: How can I become mod
 Kitis:&#160;?
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/moderation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/moderation</a> here
 Kitis: where is the form
 Kitis: if its on discord my computer blocked it.
 Thorcode: how to become guru?
 Wontonimo: to be guru, you must climb mountain in loincloth, grow long beard, and hold a walking stick that you don't need
 miszu: is there a way to put breaking point in the IDE?
 miszu: for debugging
 Thorcode: to be honest CG is cool but hard
 struct: I feel like there are some harder sites though
 Thorcode: yeah like codewar
 Thorcode: I feel like I'm a noob in code
 miszu: 143rd in the 2048 game
 Justin-Truong: nice
 miszu: forgot my pragmas
 miszu: brb
 Justin-Truong: bruh
 Thorcode: what is pragmas
 Justin-Truong: I gotta go
 miszu: Thorcode it is a cheat code you use in C++ to make your code runs faster
 Thorcode: nice
 miszu: if you feel adventurous you can read about it but it's very technical
 Thorcode: I wish I learn c++
 miszu: start today!
 Thorcode: but I learn python
 Thorcode: so it is much slower
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: I will learn almost everything to beat that cat
 Thorcode: wish me luck :grin:

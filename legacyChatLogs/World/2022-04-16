 Husoski: SubZeRoy9 Nobody's answered in over an hour, so maybe you're not interested anymore...but a small if statement will work for Mars Lander 1.  Think about controlling your maximum downward speed (see the problem statement).
 eulerscheZahl: "proper way", how do you define that. there are search algorithms used too. but that's more interesting for the optim version of mars lander
 VizGhar: If "big if statement" solves the problem and you even get those economical achievements, then if statement is way to go for sure 
 jacek: happy Caturday
 NewCoder09: can anyone help me with mars lander episode 2?
 VizGhar: One hour and still no question asked :P
 weebiss: ...
 jacek: :upside_down:
 weebiss: oh hi
 weebiss: hii
 weebiss: anyone??
 Kokoz: hello&#160;:)
 weebiss: hi
 vaeng: Is there a way to use Fortran in codingame?
 Kokoz: I dont know what Fortran is&#160;:/
 weebiss: Whats that
 vaeng: A pretty old programming language that is used a lot for scientific programming
 weebiss: Ahh i see
 vaeng: Weather forecast, fluid simulation, ...
 weebiss: :thinking:
 weebiss: ok
 jacek: you can make a request on forum to add this futuristic language
 Westicles: vaeng, you can get to it through bash but otherwise no
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: Fortran implementations are often faster than C++ implementations.
 Westicles: it is already installed, it comes free with g++.  should be easy for them to add
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20180000413/downloads/20180000413.pdf">https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20180000413/downloads/20180000413.pdf</a>
 Westicles: how do you figure out if you should score or block in counting tictactoe?
 weebiss: hii im back
 jacek: Westicles do the mirror thing and youre good to go
 Westicles: what's the mirror thing?

 Westicles: hmmm, well drawing every game doesn't seem to be a good strategy to get to wood1
 eulerscheZahl: funny that it still hasn't been dealt with
 jacek: :rage:

 Uljahn: pls post clash invites on the #clash channel, not here, thanks
 Chrimle: I've not received my certification test results. How do I solve this?
 Uljahn: DM [CG]Thibaud or wait till monday
 VizGhar: somebody asked similar on discord (without response)
 jacek: on friday? :thinking:
 Uljahn: somebody with same nick
 jacek: woah
 VizGhar: :grimacing:
 Passifi: You know, these are holidays in the civilized world, you wouldn't expect your swedish staff to work on walpurgis night would you&#160;?
 VizGhar: Quite offen
 Chrimle: What's that supposed to mean? There are plenty of people working on christmas eve, and new years eve etc. Sweden may have a bunch of christian holidays, but not many are actually christians. I won't assume anything about anyone's work schedule. I encounter a problem, I report about a problem. No matter which day it is.
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 jacek: but theyll probably fix it on monday
 Chrimle: Let's hope so! :slight_smile:
 VizGhar: And he asked on chat and discord... those are proper channels of communication even during holidays :P Try to call them :S
 Chrimle: :sweat_smile:
 VizGhar: Heh... I got to gold in mad pod racing even without any steering implementation and looking just one turn ahead...
 jacek: you only need -3vel for gold
 VizGhar: -3vel?
 Uljahn: target - 3*Velocity
 VizGhar: First time I see this :D
 jacek: oO
 Uljahn: rly?
 VizGhar: yeah... but to be honest I was too lazy to search through whole forum
 VizGhar: Bunch of guys unable to read inputs&#160;:|
 VizGhar: for legend it is GA/SA/NN&#160;?
 jacek: GA/SA
 jacek: but probably some bunch of ifs is sufficient
 jacek: NN is for the top of the tops
 VizGhar: I can't do NNs&#160;:) I'm too lazy for this and not very confident
 VizGhar: * not confident at all
 VizGhar: With SA I'm always struggling with initial temperature, if you guys have any resources on that
 jacek: i never done SA
 Uljahn: guess your GA in the search race has some SA flavor
 VizGhar: Understandable... I want to try it. It is much faster then GA but boy it's random :P
 jacek: SA flavor?
 Uljahn: like decreasing mutation range
 jacek: oh
 Uljahn: it's basically an analogy of SA temperature
 jacek: i just dont know anything about SA sane hyperparameteres
 Uljahn: VizGhar: SA is random, but not so random as MC, i think SA and GA are just trying to guide randomness
 Murat_Eroglu: Excuse my ignorance but what is SA and MC&#160;?
 jacek: simulated annealing. monte carlo
 Murat_Eroglu: Thanks
 VizGhar: I'll have to create my own pit for testing parameters :D Is brutaltester helpful in any way here?
 VizGhar: I've used it once and It was a bit painful
 VizGhar: BTW explain to me the "target - 3*Velocity" again
 VizGhar: (I'm not thinking right now)
 jacek: target = target checkpoint - 3 * your pod velocity
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: go clash
 CodiNaruto: hey, I am trying to get the success in which you have to get 5 upvote on a contribution.

 CodiNaruto: of course&#160;:)
 Mortis_666: bruh i joined a clash and left it, but it doesnt remove me from the clash, drop so much rank&#160;:(

 VizGhar: Uljahn :pray:
 VizGhar: It's nice that you don't need physics if you have computational power :D
 Uljahn: actually i have some simplified simulation (ignoring collisions) to do some bruteforce above -3Vel heuristic
 VizGhar: for opponent prediction?
 VizGhar: or for your own?
 omylist: may i know where can find people join coding escape for beginner&#160;?
 jacek: try discord

 eulerscheZahl: some are free for everyone to play
 ForRest_dev: guys, I am new here so I am a bit confused, where I can start learning some useful staff
 ForRest_dev: I saw there was some kind of a game here or was it just an advertising like this?
 jacek: probably this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/mad-pod-racing">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/mad-pod-racing</a>
 VizGhar: You won't learn basics here if that's what you are asking...
 eulerscheZahl: "where I can start learning some useful staff"Thibaud is the most useful staff member for starters. jupoulton for SDK questions
 jacek: and whos the best for banning?
 VizGhar: EU&#160;;)
 TheRipperJack: guys, im working on a problem. my console output , standart output stream shows the correct answer but it says failure "Found: Nothing".
 VizGhar: endline?
 TheRipperJack: oh yes thank you
 a-Rye: ForRest_dev try Activities -&gt; Learn. Then, try Activities -&gt; Practice -&gt; Easy Puzzles or Activities -&gt; Compete -&gt; Clash of Code
 freshskates: anyone here from sunnyvale?
 Passifi: Man, in general I like really like coding in c++ but whenever a puzzle has intensive parsing it just becomes a nightmare :scream:
 VizGhar: understandable&#160;:)
 VizGhar: but if you reach hard/veryhard puzzles or bot programming, you will be grateful for c++ again
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'll just stick with C#
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too stubborn
 Passifi: is working with strings better in c#&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it's easier to code
 jacek: ill stick to C char array
 Westicles: :taco: BlaiseEbuth
 Wontonimo: hey VizGhar , if you are are still around and want to know about the -3v thing, here is the best (and easiest) paper I've found to date that explains why <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 Wontonimo: it is the same concept that is used for cruise control in cars, basic auto pilot, and tuning shocks in cars.
 Wontonimo: and basic AM radio receiver.
 Wontonimo: and a lot more applications
 jacek: AM radio receiver :older_man:
 Wontonimo: it's also in FM but it's not as obvious, as it is kinda mixed in with the extra complications of frequency modulation 
 SubZeRoy9: Oh crap. I accidentally registered for the bot programming challenge thinking it was a game mode... I hardly know how to do if statements!
 jacek: oh my
 Wontonimo: no prob.  there is no cost or penalty for not competing SubZeRoy9
 AlexYankouski: is it possible to join just short mode clashes?
 jacek: no
 AdemDj12: hey

 ASM_MOV_INT: yes, just join clashes and quit until you find one you like
 ytaya: hey
 ytaya: how can i know the clash is souther or faster&#160;?
 Passifi: if it has a distinct drawling sound to it its southern else its faster
 Tommyyy: who likes flutter?
 ASM_MOV_INT: short mode, fast mode, reverse mode
 ASM_MOV_INT: the mode is listed next to the timer
 ASM_MOV_INT: once it starts.... in the top left
 ASM_MOV_INT: :wink:

 puppydytt: Hi everyone! I've got trouble, all tests passing but when i press submit the site says that I  have 1 incorrect but I fiexd it. I reloaded page but result still same
 puppydytt: Admins?

 ycsvenom: Thibaud there is [Shortest ,Fastest ,Reverse] modes in CoC ,why don't you add [Performance] mode a mode that will give the player 15 mins as usual but the most optimal and fastest code will win and it's measured in nanoseconds
 grahamcracker1234: that would make all interpreted languages obsolete
 ycsvenom: it will be a huge upgrade for the platform
 ycsvenom: i know but no problem
 ycsvenom: like in shortest it made all compiled languages obsoletegrahamcracker1234
 grahamcracker1234: i suppose that's fair
 puppydytt: The following validators differ from the puzzle test cases to prevent hard coded solutions. This is why you can have some fails here even if all of the tests provided in the IDE have been successfully passed
 puppydytt: what does it mean?
 BobLob: Perl and BASH would like to have a word about shortest
 BobLob: ( at least in regards to interpreted languages )
 ycsvenom: puppydyttthere are always n*2 testcases for all problems n visible in the ide and n behind the scene testcases 
 ycsvenom: if you manage to solve all the n visible ones it didn't mean that you solved the problem it just means that you solved half the problem
 ycsvenom: your code should be able to fit all testcases 
 ycsvenom: to assure that you didn't provide the answers of testcases explicitly
 grahamcracker1234: sometimes testcase validators are poorly made tbf
 grahamcracker1234: at least on coc ones
 ycsvenom: that's very possibledon't forget that some human made it 
 Darleanow: HEY EVERYONEmissed y'all
 Gilel: wahoo
 Gilel: :apple:
 ruggedcabbage: @grahamcracker1234 you play some crazy games and your code is near perfect everytime, how many YOE do you have?
 grahamcracker1234: haha thanks for the compliments
 grahamcracker1234: I started programming when I was 11, but I only started taking it seriously when I was like 13-14 im 20 now so hopefully that explains it
 grahamcracker1234: as for ruby, i learned it specifically for coc, but i've fallen in love with it. I probs have maybe a little under a year of experience with it
 Ducks404: when you decided to take it seriously, what did you do?

 Meme_Magician: Bruh... We out here coding. Cease
 daffie: smells like gucci?
 RDeeee: brainwash0000
 MACKEYTH: Java really needs a handicap in CoC shortest.
 BenjaminUrquhart: just don't use java
 MACKEYTH: But I waanaaa!
 VizGhar: then deal with it&#160;:)
 MACKEYTH: Mean&#160;;)
 VizGhar: I was forced to learn little bit of ruby because of it... Also with java you are most probably not winning other types of CoC right?
 MACKEYTH: Shortest is really the only one where I feel disadvantaged.
 VizGhar: You have 15 minutes to Google every time "Shortest" pops up
 VizGhar: well I'm kotlin dev, so I've had similar problems. You have to learn new lang
 MACKEYTH: It would be a good opportunity to brush up on my Python.
 VizGhar: Thats the spirit&#160;:) 
 MACKEYTH: I am getting really good at ternary expressions.
 Lockes_TheThief: I just know basic syntax in C, C++ and C# but I can't figure out how to logically use my code
 IcyFlame7: heu im new here
 IcyFlame7: hey
 IcyFlame7: sup
 Nezinau: Hi
 IcyFlame7: im just got access to the chat
 IcyFlame7: im not so good at python so the descnet was rly hard 4 me
 IcyFlame7: wait i have a question
 IcyFlame7: oh wait nvm
 Nezinau: I am new here too, know nothing basically&#160;:/
 TheHardDrug: Not to worry, ive been coding web sites on python for 2 years, and feeling really dumb trying to solve this puzzles :D
 IcyFlame7: ikr
 IcyFlame7: im learning the ai thingy now
 IcyFlame7: oh wait i got it
 IcyFlame7: im so blind lmfao
 TheHardDrug: :grin:
 IcyFlame7: i didnt see that the x was the y
 Burnerlover: i only barley know html
 IcyFlame7: i mess around with html though im like terrible
 IcyFlame7: yessir
 IcyFlame7: so um
 IcyFlame7: im doing the wood 1 thing now
 Kirneh: Any C# coders that can help me with a list declaration problem&#160;?
 Kirneh: Have this declaration in a member var inputLines2 = new List&lt;string[]&gt;(); and it works fine. I want to move this out to the class so it can be used in another member. But it wont let me declare using "var" there
 Illedan: What is the full code Kirneh?
 chrispickford: You need to strongly type class fields/properties. Are you sure this is the right approach, maybe you should pass your list to the other member as a parameter. What happens in the case your field/prop isn't instantiated?
 MadKnight: hey guys what
 MadKnight: s a good method to check if u can build a chain of dominos from a list of domino pieces?
 hem123: no splits?
 hem123: well if it is yes or no you can count the outs.
 MadKnight: what outs
 conaldev: hi 
 _programmer_: Hello
 IcyFlamer1: heyy
 IcyFlamer1: im new
 MadKnight: hi new
 IcyFlamer1: hey
 IcyFlamer1: is there any other ai challenge thats easy to get to bronze for begineers like me other then the pad thing
 MadKnight: even better
 IcyFlamer1:&#160;?
 MadKnight: there's an easy way to get to gold in this pod thing
 IcyFlamer1: yeah
 MadKnight: just subtract velocity from checkpoint
 IcyFlamer1: i want to find a challenge as easy as the pod thing
 IcyFlamer1: im good in the pod
 MadKnight: in what lang do u code&#160;?
 IcyFlamer1: python
 MadKnight: nice
 IcyFlamer1: the pods easy
 IcyFlamer1: my quest now is to get 2 bronze
 IcyFlamer1: what do u think is easy for a second one?
 MadKnight: how good do u code&#160;?
 IcyFlamer1: ok
 IcyFlamer1: not sure
 MadKnight: ok?
 IcyFlamer1: like 3 months of experienc then came here
 MadKnight: it's just that it's pretty easy to get bronze in any
 IcyFlamer1: im like bad
 MadKnight: most people get bronze with just a bunch of if()s 
 MadKnight: in every game
 IcyFlamer1: ah
 IcyFlamer1: is the tic tac toe one ok?
 MadKnight: it
 MadKnight: it's just that u need some actually nice ifs
 IcyFlamer1: oh ok
 IcyFlamer1: idk where to start
 MadKnight: hypersonic maybe
 IcyFlamer1: sure
 IcyFlamer1: ill go check it out
 MadKnight: games with arrays - code4life, codealamode, legends, 
 IcyFlamer1: cool
 MadKnight: like ifs and arrays
 IcyFlamer1: k
 IcyFlamer1: let me read the thing
 IcyFlamer1: can u help with the first league
 IcyFlamer1: idk how to start with hypersonic
 Domantas1: Hello! how can i make some of my drones move to neutral zone if it's not occupied by other player. c++ game&#160;: Game of drones
 DaNinja: just output the x y of the zone
 Domantas1: thx
 VizGhar: Hey. Just a quick question. Is it possible to get to Legend League on contests without implementing any kind of NN or GA?
 VizGhar: I have a long way to get to those algos even tho I've already implemented some GA before
 Uljahn: NN on contests is so rare, the only attempt i know about was during 1 month contest (Zuko3D's bot in LOCAM)
 Uljahn: also GA is so 2016 :upside_down:
 VizGhar: So only "bruteforce" :P I'm here for about 1 month, so just asking
 wlesavo: VizGhar most of latest contests were quite friendly to nosearch bots and legend was possible with python, but you still need to implement a lot of things to be competitive
 wlesavo: by most i mean 2, wasnt around before :smiley:
 Uljahn: also, bruteforce is infeasible for most recent contests, you should be more clever than that
 ThisUsernameIsAvaliable: i've been here all of 2 hours and have learned, I don't know as much as I thought lol
 Ninja811: hello
 AntiSquid: greetings
 ProgrammerDog: lmao I made a contribution and its sooo easy
 eulerscheZahl: then you could consider putting quality over quantity
 ProgrammerDog: quality? whats that
 eulerscheZahl: some buzzword i've heard a while ago. wanted to sound smart now
 Astrobytes: I know "no clash is too easy" but... 
 b0n5a1: it's a variation of "add 0"...
 eulerscheZahl: "n cats eat n rats in n minutes. How long will it take for m cats to eat m rats?"
 eulerscheZahl: follows the rules of none being too easy
 eulerscheZahl: i see no reason to refuse it without breaking the moderation guidelines
 Astrobytes: I couldn't refuse it if I tried. I'd have to clash first
 eulerscheZahl: or to approve JBM's FreeCell with a broken default code that he calls a WONT_FIX
 JBM: got a solution?
 eulerscheZahl: haven't tried yet. but will fore sure
 eulerscheZahl: probably some A*
 JBM: there comes a point where i don't want to be bogged down by stub limitations anymore
 eulerscheZahl: with the number of remaining cards as a good heuristic
 JBM: it's a hard puzzle, the input format makes sense, the player can figure it out
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, annoying when you have to change the input format just so the stubs can read it...
 eulerscheZahl: just make that line a string(256) or whatever so it compiles?
 JBM: it's a possibility
 JBM: is it a better possibility?
 JBM: the stub works in many languages
 eulerscheZahl: it does? :o
 JBM: last I tried
 eulerscheZahl: didn't know that the +1 is possible in some
 JBM: me neither
 JBM: tried it out of despair
 JBM: got a happy C++ surprise
 eulerscheZahl: the stub generator (or CG in general) never fails to surprise me
 eulerscheZahl: and i thought i know what it can and can't do
 JBM: just let me use my own stub generator
 JBM: you're already trusting me with the referee, how bad could it get?
 eulerscheZahl: how does yours handle the possible addition of new languages in the future?
 JBM: There Shall Be No New Languages.
 ProgrammerDog: i got one reject
 JBM: i mean, same as CG
 JBM: i'll add it when it comes
 ProgrammerDog: they don't like it because it's too hard 
 ProgrammerDog: i should do something hareder
 eulerscheZahl: "No CoC puzzle is too easy."<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines</a>
 JBM: "except when it is"
 eulerscheZahl: share that in the comments and demand to revoke the refusal vote
 eulerscheZahl: escalate to the manager
 eulerscheZahl: your stub uses and int where it should be a long
 SPDene: new submission idea: Your task is to output the string "No CoC puzzle is too easy." :P
 ProgrammerDog: I actually wanted to make that first
 JBM: more seriously, all cards are words anyway, i could get away with just incrementing the damn counter and declaring counts start at 1 not 0
 JBM: but it wouldn't be Right
 JBM: i'll think it over after the code cleanup
 eulerscheZahl: removing the colon is not an option to keep the format of the online solver i guess?
 SPDene: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9e8be728-012b-4be9-8928-e04dcd9d45eb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9e8be728-012b-4be9-8928-e04dcd9d45eb</a>
 eulerscheZahl: tbh the 8 consecutive loops already trigger me. I know it's necessary as they have different sizes
 eulerscheZahl: which is obviously much easier than the original problem @SPDene&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: but i get your point
 JBM: i don't really expect anybody to keep the input stub
 JBM: i just strive to have it kind of work long enough to reach the example
 eulerscheZahl: i usually keep the starter code and extend from there
 Aya_Noaman: join my game from #clash
 LastRick: The stub generator gives me so much anxiety, I only now submitted my first contribution. NOOOO idea if it works for languages I don't program in. 
 eulerscheZahl: pascal's neighbor?
 eulerscheZahl: want my feedback on your input format? no? i'll give you anyways
 eulerscheZahl: first line should be some n, then n numbers in the next line
 eulerscheZahl: for the first testcase it would then be:50 1 2 3 4
 eulerscheZahl: the stub:read n:intloopline n val:int
 LastRick: Please, all feedback welcome. I was just surprised I couldn't find it already done on your lookup page.
 LastRick: Literally stole the idea from a lesson we teach elementary kids
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures</a>the input format should be oriented on the temperatures input
 LastRick: I had that originally (N, then N numbers) but I changed it because if that was presented to me in Dart, I would just split the numbers on " " and get N that way. But I understand if not all languages can do that
 eulerscheZahl: some some languages it would be heavy lifting to do it without N
 LastRick: see, good to know!
 eulerscheZahl: that's not a CG-only thing. go to codeforces, codechef, hackerrank, ...it's common to give an integer N and then N numbers in the next line
 JBM: i grant the stub generator as much respect as it deserves
 JBM: and it's *never* ever given a haskell stub I could use to solve the problem
 chrispickford: Anyone know what compiler version the C# editor uses?
 LastRick: Changes made! Thanks, Euler. If you think it's good to go, please upvote.
 eulerscheZahl: i stay out of the CoC moderation process
 eulerscheZahl: in the past i did some cleanup on too easy / duplicated ones
 eulerscheZahl: then the moderation guidelines came in place, explicitly stating that they are allowed
 eulerscheZahl: while i'm not happy with that, i have to accept that. so i just stopped moderating
 LastRick: Interesting. Do you think that should be handled only by CG staff?
 eulerscheZahl: also cleaning up the obvious mess in most cases (like broken stubs&#160;;) )
 eulerscheZahl: no. if only staff does the moderation, we won't see much new content getting approved
 LastRick: That would be my fear too.
 eulerscheZahl: they set the guidelines how members should do it. i don't agree with it (or at least some aspects of it). so i don't do it
 LastRick: But I also worry that too much openness (so many people can approve) without enough guidelines in place leads to questionable content
 LastRick: Hah, jinx
 eulerscheZahl: and now we have a quest map in place to further encourage that process ("moderate a contribution", "create a contribution")
 eulerscheZahl: which encourages minimum effort puzzles and clashes
 LastRick: Fascinating. Not saying I disagree, but how we would set guidelines on "minimum" difficulty/complexity for a Clash?
 eulerscheZahl: i could possibly extract some upvote statistics to confirm my cast. if there wasn't a quest "upvote a contribution"
 LastRick: Or the other side of it, my current status, which is "submit a contribution".
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i don't really care about clashes. i don't clash myself
 ruasd: hello&#160;??
 ruasd: anyone online now
 LastRick: no one is here
 eulerscheZahl: but sometimes i spot puzzles in the approved section with lots of typos or a broken default code (well, that was before the quest map already)
 eulerscheZahl: hello?hellooooo?
 eulerscheZahl: echo
 LastRick: I guess one of the things I like best about this site is that we can all get something different from it. My favorite is the IN/OUT (w occasional clashes to stay sharp). Maybe you like the compete section. We all find our niche 
 eulerscheZahl: true. i know that there are lots of users who like clashing
 LastRick: and yes there are a lot of bad puzzles. Which brings us full circle, we could use some guidelines
 eulerscheZahl: so they should moderate them. how shall i know what they like?
 LastRick: fair point
 eulerscheZahl: and another aspect i don't agree with: every contribution gives 250XP when approved. i can tell you that creating a clash isn't the same amount of skill or effort invested as a full-blown multiplayer game
 eulerscheZahl: easily takes a full weekend. especially if you are new to the CG SDK
 LastRick: yeah that doesn't seem fair, maybe a different value for each size puzzle/clash
 eulerscheZahl: not doing it for the XP. but it would show some appreciation
 LastRick: Yeah. Great talking to you (like always), gotta hop off for a while.
 VizGhar: look at egyptian multiplication puzzle in hard... its hardly of medium difficulty&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: got auto-categorized
 eulerscheZahl: initially community puzzles had no difficulty
 JBM: yay, another SDK bug
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: what did you break this time?
 JBM: i think i stopped counting
 JBM: yet another case over overzealous html sanitizing
 JBM: so let's make the input worse so it passes
 eulerscheZahl: oh that. i see the statement as one big bug, not as many smaller ones
 eulerscheZahl:

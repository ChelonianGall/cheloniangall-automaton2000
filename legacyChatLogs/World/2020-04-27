 AndreiVoinea: hi
 Oioi: Hi
 Oioi: Is there a way to know which puzzles I already made&#160;?
 Oioi: More precisely, I would like to know which puzzles I began but didn't end
 aCat: It's visible on the top of puzzle page in given category
 aCat: but I'm not sure it's visible if you didn't submit (and get something &lt; 100%)&#160;;/
 Oioi: ok, I try it, thanks
 Oioi: It is visible, thanks again
 thibpat: hi :wave: we're live, and we'll continue to work on the Twixt-PP challenge <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 roodey75: Hi
 WINWINWIN: Anyone here good wtih C#/
 WINWINWIN: &gt;
 WINWINWIN:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: so how the hell am i supposed to format the answer for ss_n&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: ss_n?
 AntiSquid: check this crap first&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach</a> WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: thanks
 A.F: how to do CODERS STRIKE BACK
 A.F: :grinning:
 jrke: yes how to do it gold league
 AntiSquid: ask more specific questions if you want help A.F
 Uljahn: have you changed the inputs from the silver?
 AntiSquid: what do you mean&#160;?
 Uljahn: there are new inputs in csb gold
 Uljahn: so you should use "restore default code" button
 AntiSquid: ah thought you were talking about breach ...
 Uljahn: ye, im doing breach now
 AntiSquid: i tried applying a different color code, not sure if it worked or how to make it work
 A.F: what? AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: yes
 Arnav-S: when i console.log('\n') why does it print 2 blank lines
 AntiSquid: also ignoring private messages, not interested in a long convo
 AntiSquid: A.F read
 A.F: in c ++
 A.F: can you speak persian
 jrke: no
 Uljahn: nani
 A.F: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 AntiSquid: click submit inside IDE and close tab, done, finished
 jrke: till silver it is easy csb
 A.F: no i can not write  this code
 AntiSquid: then quit
 A.F: what?
 Uljahn: you cant solve multi like a puzzle
 A.F: how to write this code
 Uljahn: are you new here?
 A.F: yes
 AntiSquid: oh i made progress with that retarded puzzle, got few extra frames, kinda stupid really it doesn't tell you what the output format should be
 Uljahn: so you should guess?
 AntiSquid: in CSB it tells you what the expected output is A.F
 AntiSquid: yes you have to guess that crap Uljahn
 Uljahn: A.F: have you solved Onboarding puzzle? try some more easy puzzles first, don't do coders strike back right now
 A.F: what is csb
 Uljahn: csb == coders strike back
 AntiSquid: the shit you link A.F
 SandiIrawan:  :flag_cn::thumbsdown:
 AntiSquid: Uljahn so basically, was trying different formatting ways after the first output didn't work (single int):
 AntiSquid: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d09691df-73ff-407f-86c8-0b042c7d45ab">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d09691df-73ff-407f-86c8-0b042c7d45ab</a>
 AntiSquid: and then realized it just wants an extra step in the sequence
 Uljahn: interesting
 A.F: thanks
 Uljahn: AntiSquid: is that some updated IDE in breach?
 Astrobytes: They've updated the IDE
 Astrobytes: CG, that is
 Uljahn: indeed
 AntiSquid: i don't see any update&#160;:/
 Uljahn: ctrl+f5?
 AntiSquid: looks same as before&#160;?
 Astrobytes: clear yer cache
 Uljahn: wth it's so alien
 Astrobytes: It's actually.... useable! :scream_cat:
 AntiSquid: still confused
 AntiSquid: i see some slight text formatting change
 AntiSquid: how do i change format settings for IDE again?
 Uljahn: ctrl+, doesn't work now
 Astrobytes: The old one was Ctrl+, the new one is F1
 Uljahn: thx
 Astrobytes: I like it
 Uljahn: ah so it's more VSC now
 Astrobytes: yeah
 AntiSquid: i click command pallete and nothing pops up&#160;:/
 Uljahn: noice
 AntiSquid: well looks prettier but font is a bit small for my screen
 Astrobytes: Settings on the left
 Astrobytes: or you can zoom in from the Command Palette
 AntiSquid: ya that doesn't pop up
 AntiSquid: pressing F1, i get drop down menu, i select command palette, menu disappears
 Astrobytes: Can you get to it via right-click?
 AntiSquid: getting the drop down menu from there :D
 Astrobytes: cool
 [CG]SaiksyApo: F1 is the command palette
 AntiSquid: it doesn't open up 
 Astrobytes: Works fine here
 AntiSquid: i will just use ctrl +/- for now
 Astrobytes: Which browser AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: that doesn't resize all the page anymore, which is good
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Astro was talking about the font size setting in the left pane i think
 AntiSquid: i tried on opera and firefox Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I'm fine in Opera
 Uljahn: ye, there is a new setting
 Astrobytes: Yep, and a minimap
 AntiSquid: ya was referring to the font size, the one of the left can't be set by number, you have preset some values, so ctrl + or - will do
 Astrobytes: There's a zoom in the palette tho
 AntiSquid: oh minimap is nice
 Astrobytes: yeah, very handy
 Uljahn: indentation rulers for the dark theme in python now visible
 AntiSquid: btw for the actual visual studio code, i get errors marked in red on the minimap, didn't manage to turn it off although i turned off a lot of red underlining
 AntiSquid: happened after a recent upgrade
 Astrobytes: Hm, haven't used it for a while
 Astrobytes: Nice Uljahn!
 jrke: new update for website
 AntiSquid: read chat history :p
 jrke: :grimacing:
 jrke: nice update
 AntiSquid: so Breach is a guesswork puzzle, will continue later&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: 10% lol
 Astrobytes: I started doing it cause you were talking about it, what a pain in the ass of a puzzle
 AntiSquid: ya it's more annoying than challenging imo 
 jrke: antisquid where are u from
 Astrobytes: Yes. It's really awkward.
 AntiSquid: laniakea jrke
 AntiSquid: known universe
 jrke: ohhh
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: so "little harder" gives me a string and i need to guess what type what int it wants as output
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/613e0dce-90fe-45fe-b3c3-e4155d99d4d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/613e0dce-90fe-45fe-b3c3-e4155d99d4d3</a>
 AntiSquid: so now i need to keep guessing if it wants the index or the length or something else ... wow
 Astrobytes: It's not really much of a programming puzzle is it
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: just if else and guess work really
 jrke: hey what's in spring challenge 2020
 AntiSquid: but it's in very hard because of poorly done statement with incomplete info 
 AntiSquid: the statement is the challenge
 Astrobytes: Yeah, for real
 jrke: hey what's in spring challenge 2020
 Uljahn: ban
 AntiSquid: don't spam please man&#160;:/
 jrke: K
 AntiSquid: did you click the challenge / had a look at the cover image jrke&#160;?
 AntiSquid: that's all the information everyone (officially) gets until the contest starts
 AntiSquid: as you can see it's probably a pacman themed game
 AntiSquid: see discord channel for more information jrke
 Uljahn: those leaks in the past ruined some fun&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: but everyone knows pacman and cover is pacman, what else to expect?
 Astrobytes: He-Man obviously
 AntiSquid: (oh and power ups)
 Astrobytes: I thought there was a rule about "powerups"
 MSmits: "I have the power!!!!"
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: Space Maze: completed by 3 codingamers, now this looks like headache :o
 MSmits: is that eulers?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: should be fun at least
 Astrobytes: Looks beastly af
 AntiSquid: but at least it's straight forward
 Astrobytes: The instructions are clear, yes
 AntiSquid: no fake mobius strip / incomplete statement
 Astrobytes: And it's got a little car
 AntiSquid: from mean max 
 Astrobytes: Yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: euler is creative with assets
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Makes good games tho'
 MSmits: that look good too
 Astrobytes: Onitama is lovely looking
 MSmits: this is the only game where i sometimes just look at replays for no apparent reason
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 MSmits: param fitting is getting annoying
 MSmits: I found this local maximum where I win kar liso near 80% and the rest is maybe 55-60%
 MSmits: but I know it can be better, but anything i do lowers kar liso winrate by a lot
 AntiSquid: how do you fit your params?
 MSmits: cg bench
 AntiSquid: i mean the actual param fitting process
 MSmits: just one by one
 AntiSquid: aha that's why
 MSmits: i spread
 Astrobytes: lol, how annoying
 MSmits: how should i be doing it AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: i mean you do it like a linear regression of sorts
 AntiSquid: and you need multiple linear regression
 MSmits: yes but i have 8 constants
 AntiSquid: well multiple regression i mean
 MSmits: have to look into that I guess
 AntiSquid: check dependent variables, interdependent vars etc ... 
 Astrobytes: That's actually quite a good idea
 AntiSquid: independent *
 MSmits: yeah... exploration parameter is independent
 MSmits: the rest is not
 AntiSquid: no i mean when you fine tune
 MSmits: oh
 AntiSquid: you need to watch out what you fine tune for and how the vars affect each other
 MSmits: thats difficult to do. I also get a lot of variation with the different opponents
 MSmits: I am testing 4
 AntiSquid: and the var you fine tune is the dependant var and you need to see what it is dependant on and then see how the vars that it is dependent on are dependent on each other
 AntiSquid: and there's a bunch of formulas you need to apply
 MSmits: I'll just use a tool somehow
 AntiSquid: it's maths / stats
 Astrobytes: You could probably just write one
 MSmits: there must be one
 Uljahn: sort of correlation in variation?
 MSmits: yeah i guess it's a kind of correlation
 AntiSquid: what tool do you intend to use?
 Astrobytes: Excel...
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://regressit.com/regressitpc.html">https://regressit.com/regressitpc.html</a> this maybe?
 MSmits: addon for ecel
 MSmits: excel
 Astrobytes: Do you know R?
 AntiSquid: oh cheat, i thought you are going to write up the entire thing :p
 MSmits: nah this is not my idea of fun. I like the fitting, but I dont want to write my own tools here
 Astrobytes: Learn R, you can do anything stats with R
 AntiSquid: ok
 MSmits: I do want something simple Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Meh. Go back to your Excel :P
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits: mmh, now it wants me to change decimal symbol to do
 AntiSquid: well excel became very versatile
 MSmits: t
 AntiSquid: all the add ins and plugins and  ...
 Astrobytes: bloat?
 AntiSquid: why call it bloat?
 Astrobytes: All the Office stuff is bloated
 Astrobytes: I still use it though
 AntiSquid: but using the extra stuff is optional
 AntiSquid: guess you can use google docs instead less functionalities&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's when you need lots of the extra stuff it gets annoying
 Astrobytes: I hate Google Docs
 Astrobytes: I can live with Office
 MSmits: the online version of microsoft is worse
 MSmits: the browser one i mean
 AntiSquid: i find this great:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://mashable.com/2014/08/27/microsoft-excel-games/?europe=true">https://mashable.com/2014/08/27/microsoft-excel-games/?europe=true</a>

 Astrobytes: lol someone did a roguelike in Excel
 Astrobytes: Very creative
 MSmits: I like how you can do things quick and easy in excel, but the vba code behind it is horrible
 MSmits: sometimes I have to use it
 MSmits: I :cry:
 AntiSquid: can't find it right now but there was some interesting pipeline project, reading emails filtering through them, downloading attachments and presenting them in excel ... something like that
 MaciejF: There you are speaking about advanced excel stuff while my most advanced excel project looks like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/FGroEru">https://imgur.com/FGroEru</a>
 Adnmaster: is it impossible to get to wood 2 in code royale??!!
 AntiSquid: that's good, i didn't do much in excel :p
 Adnmaster: im better than the duchess boss, both in leaderboard and test
 AntiSquid: what about the other players Adnmaster
 Adnmaster: then why does it say duchess boss is better than everybody?
 Adnmaster: and you have to defeat the duchess boss?
 AntiSquid: is your submit at 100%?
 Adnmaster: yes
 AntiSquid: is there a promotion timer?
 Adnmaster: yes
 AntiSquid: queen 21.78 pointsyou 19.93
 AntiSquid: so you are not better than the boss
 Adnmaster: do you get points by killing people?
 Adnmaster: *winning
 Adnmaster: ok thanks
 MSmits: aww dammit look at this
 MSmits: 12:40:54,796 INFO  Temporary results (time left estimation&#160;: 79 minutes)&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ce80555-da8d-4ef4-8285-cee5c6b12bf0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ce80555-da8d-4ef4-8285-cee5c6b12bf0</a>
 AntiSquid: even the history changed for the IDE
 MSmits: now tric trac is messing me up
 AntiSquid: please explain MSmits are you getting better or worse
 MSmits: both
 MSmits: better overall, better vs kar liso, but if i'm below 50% with anyone, they can spam submit and pull me down :P
 AntiSquid: ah you raised your win rate vs everyone? hard to tell with just these results
 MSmits: no, i lowered it vs tric trac
 MSmits: i have another version that has 90% winrate vs him, but 30% vs kar liso
 MSmits: it's really annoying 
 Astrobytes: So close, yet so far!
 AntiSquid: so what adjustments did you make now&#160;?
 MSmits: it's just a constant i lowered. Something to do with the master being threatened
 Uljahn: is it possible to identify your opponent and use best set of params like kovi did in OoC? :thinking:
 MSmits: hmm not exactly. You can identify types of opponent by looking at choices they make
 MSmits: such as, is this a chain-silencer?
 MSmits: or,does this person always use silence with distance 0
 MSmits: then you can adjust your bot based on that
 MSmits: that wont work for me in onitama though
 MSmits: games are too short, too little information
 Uljahn: ah, i see
 Nerchio: i swear i spent way too much time on doing basic board manipulation for bandas
 Nerchio: xD
 Nerchio: shame
 MaciejF: does anyone here use CGBenchmark or CGSpunk?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: cgspunk doesn't work anymore
 AntiSquid: don't have time to help you with cgbenchmark i would ask someone else ... maybe even in #fr chat&#160;?
 LoGos: Ok, thanks. I'll try to make it work
 darkhorse64: Nerchio: bitboarding is key for bandas
 Nerchio: its about efficiency or just easier board manipulation?
 darkhorse64: Efficiency mostly. Once you get used to biboarding, it gets easy too but forget about readable code. Comments highly neededd
 Nerchio: ok i will try without bitboards first i dont need to be #1 ;p
 darkhorse64: my mcts #5 does purely random rollouts but it does many of them
 Nerchio: hehe i just realised how input is given and it wont work for my system :D
 Nerchio: i thought maybe opponent move is given or something
 darkhorse64: You need to guess it :unamused:
 MSmits: I need to go back to bandas and do a early playout termination version
 MSmits: but too much else to do
 MSmits: btw darkhorse64 I had a new insight about Onitama or fitting constants in general
 MSmits: I was fitting a constant for threatening the opponents master. Trying with 0 (high winrate), trying with score 1000 (high winrate), but with 500 it is bad
 MSmits: So I was thinking, the constant obviously has multiple peaks. Maybe these correspond to different playing strategy
 MSmits: in one strategy you actively hunt for the opponents master, in the other strategy you do not (instead maybe try to take his shrine)
 dbdr: can you graph the winrates?
 MSmits: this would explain why a half-way measure would be worse
 dbdr: enough data?
 MSmits: I have enough games for each value, but only 3 values for now
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/VF3aLcl">https://imgur.com/a/VF3aLcl</a>
 MSmits: left and right dot have 400 games
 MSmits: middle has 240 games. I stopped it because it was so bad
 dbdr: use 1500 to get more than 100% winrate&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: btw, the 0 version has this:

 ALIM: Hello everyone! Could someone tell me why i dont have 100% success to a problem even though my code passes all testcases?
 dbdr: destroying karlis o?
 MSmits: the 0 version destroys him yes
 MSmits: but also weak to tric tac
 dbdr: ALIM there is a difference between testcases and validators
 ALIM: But what can i do for that?
 MSmits: so basically it seems a bad idea to go after kar liso's master... maybe he defends it well
 dbdr: it means your code does not work, in cases not tested by the main testcases
 MSmits: but this is just all theory. My main point is... there's a lot going on here
 darkhorse64: Did you found an eval for bandas&#160;? 
 ALIM: Could you help me with my code? I would highly appreciate that
 dbdr: ALIM maybe the name of the validator can help you imagine what kind of situation does not work in
 MSmits: i havent tried yet, but all I can think of for bandas is, count you dudes and count the center dudes for more points
 struct: Hi
 MSmits: maybe some way of estimating pushing possibilities
 struct: MSmits what happened to yuor avatar?
 MSmits: problem is on your end i think struct
 eulerscheZahl: i don'T see it either
 eulerscheZahl: problem is on CG end
 MSmits: ah
 dbdr: I don't see my own :D
 ALIM: I dont know everything seems logical to me
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 dbdr: but I see MSmits
 struct: This new editor seems better
 dbdr: I think reload should fix it no?
 MSmits: i see all of you
 struct: ctrl f5 did not work
 ALIM: I have reloaded several times
 MSmits: :fire: I SEE YOU :fire:
 eulerscheZahl: wow, they replaced the editor :o
 struct: yes
 struct: ctrl mouse wheel
 struct: zooms
 eulerscheZahl: with monaco
 struct: nice
 eulerscheZahl: just a few days ago someone said that monaco is way better but will probably never happen
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN having a red panties night
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same specific challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: was it recurs e? i'm not sure anymore
 kamiathe: hi
 MSmits: sounds like re curse
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr push the chat logs
 kamiathe: is there anyone who know angular 6 pls?
 AntiSquid: wrong site to ask imo
 AntiSquid: look up a more JS centric site
 MSmits: stack overflow
 AntiSquid: google for angular 6 tutorials 
 MSmits: or just stay here and forget about all that webstuff, here's where the fun is
 AntiSquid: i think i stopped at angular 4, they were advertising it back then as the final and most sophisticated angular
 MSmits: maybe they went downhill after
 dbdr: somenody - recurs.e I think
 kamiathe: ok thx
 AntiSquid: kamiathe see freecodecamp
 eulerscheZahl: i just spammed the editor with many lines, still scrolling fine.the old editor got laggy somewhere around 1.5k lines
 AntiSquid: they have a live chat server too
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I could kill it by pasting an opening book :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: how did you submit it?

 MSmits: not sure where it hanged, maybe i was able to use play to save it
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl pushed&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: reCurse: Just switch to monaco
 eulerscheZahl: and my profile pic is broken in your logs
 MSmits: is it monaco or monaca?
 AntiSquid: your link calls it monaca
 dbdr: there's also a hit in Fr channel about rich people living in Monaco :D
 struct: Its Monaco
 MSmits: now I'm getting confused
 AntiSquid: go to that website and argue with those people then

 eulerscheZahl: &lt;div class="monaco-editor"in the HTML
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i linked the wrong docs?
 MSmits: if you dont know the name of your own product, I thihk you have a bug
 struct: "The Monaca Cloud IDE uses Monaco editor."
 eulerscheZahl: that explains why ctrl+comma for font size didn't work :D
 AntiSquid: it has a diff editor&#160;??
 MSmits: ok so monaca uses monaco
 MSmits: all we need now is someone named Monica saying that
 struct: omfg
 Astrobytes: Monica uses monaco for monads
 struct: right click editor
 struct: or press F1
 eulerscheZahl: woohoo
 AntiSquid: damn UTG is ridiculously random, completely forgot how bad it is in that regard

 WINWINWIN: Wow, python3 both at the top of CSB
 WINWINWIN: just noticed :D
 MSmits: it is, I saw the lecture and now need to complete an assignment

 AntiSquid: i done the CS50 thingy, it felt extremely useless
 MSmits: lol.. I think he is a bit annoying, but the flow of the lecture i sgood
 MSmits: AntiSquid yeah if you know a lot already then it is. did you also do the assignments?
 eulerscheZahl: that's one way to make sure that no avatars get lost :rofl:
 dbdr: oh, this is old logs
 AntiSquid: uhm i did it years ago MSmits
 Astrobytes: At least you got a lecture, when I studied that I had a textbook and an email address if I had any questions lol
 dbdr: the new ones work differently, but I have not regenerated the old ones
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 MSmits: hehe, well the first lecture about search told me nothing new, but the knowledge lecture was interesting
 MSmits: I'll point my classmates (5 of them) to CG

 eulerscheZahl: but that's fine, we need no avatars without chatlogs
 MSmits: of course, this is what you do before you go into CS at Harvard
 MSmits: it's introductory
 AntiSquid: superficial stuff?
 MSmits: yes
 AntiSquid: then i rather skip it
 dbdr: true, it's just candy. might fun nice to see people's old avatars though
 MSmits: well I need the study credit so i cant. Besides, when you like a subject enough it doesnt matter
 MSmits: it's like watching a movie you have already seen
 MSmits: you'll still enjoy it
 MSmits: if it's good enough ofc
 AntiSquid: no i wouldn't
 AntiSquid: sorry, but very difficult to rewatch stuff&#160;:/
 MSmits: ahh ok, but you eat food you like a second time
 MSmits: even when it tastes the same
 AntiSquid: it never tasts as good as the first time :p
 MSmits: depends on the food, sometimes it's bad the first time and it gets better
 MSmits: but i will not argue food with  a chef
 AntiSquid: why? there's no expert when every single person is different
 AntiSquid: can't please everyone
 MSmits: mmh ok, that's true, but I live off nutrient shakes, I think we can establish objectively that you are right in any discussion by definition
 AntiSquid: anyway, i think you can learn more if you follow your own route
 MSmits: I agree
 MSmits: but no study credits for that
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid I keep going back to that stupid fking puzzle
 AntiSquid: which one of them?
 Astrobytes: lol, this morning's one, Breach
 AntiSquid: ah
 AntiSquid: so did you guess anything new?
 Astrobytes: No I got the first one
 Astrobytes: Everything I tried for the second is wrong
 AntiSquid: ya i stopped at the upper case lower case string
 Astrobytes: Moving on to the third one
 AntiSquid: i didn't try character to int 
 struct: Whats the puzzle about?
 AntiSquid: about how good of a guesser you can be 
 MSmits: sounds like bulls and cows
 AntiSquid: no, that requires some brain cells
 MSmits: aha
 Astrobytes: This is just annoying
 AntiSquid: i mean in bulls and cows it's not purely guessing
 AntiSquid: you know what your goal is, you kinda have an idea how to reach the goal
 eulerscheZahl: breach:input: DEFgHIfind the output
 eulerscheZahl: no context given what it's about
 Astrobytes: You just fumble your way through
 MSmits: who approved it?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach</a>
 eulerscheZahl: one of them is here right now :P
 MSmits: ah I see
 Astrobytes: These sort of puzzles are fine in the CTF format, but imo not suited to a puzzle, not in the way it is currently
 Astrobytes: *CG puzzle
 MSmits: someone could change the statement
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: oh Uljahn at 20% he prolly figured out the char thingy
 eulerscheZahl: SDK contribution. and private source
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: I see, viewer
 eulerscheZahl: btw thibaud asked me about your langton bug report if we tried to update the game, sent him the screenshot that i can't update it
 MSmits: cool
 dbdr: any complaints?
 eulerscheZahl: was a little late in my reply as i was "in the office"
 AntiSquid: too many, don't want to flood the chat dbdr
 MSmits: you mean the same room you are in right now, but with office hat on
 dbdr: breach is too hard for you?&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: LOL
 eulerscheZahl: with office PC connected to my monitor
 AntiSquid: has nothing to do with difficulty
 MSmits: ah I see
 wlesavo: "in the office" somehow sounds like in a toilet
 AntiSquid: should be in a Guess category
 MSmits: wlesavo we dont all drop out turds in our cubicle
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: no context, that's the spirit of the puzzle. think like a hacker
 eulerscheZahl: i know that that's what the puzzle is about
 eulerscheZahl: tried converting to binary
 MartijnH: &lt;-- Breach 100%
 eulerscheZahl: (reading as binary i mean)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and I like those kind of problems, but in the context of this as a CG puzzle it feels clunky and awkward
 eulerscheZahl: and there were ascii art numbers. was to lazy to parse them
 eulerscheZahl: i'm all for breaking the rules to add something unique
 AntiSquid: i can spend time and guess it all, but what's the point? might as well play lottery and analyze lottery draws, but analyzing lottery draws feels less pointless
 MSmits: how about the reverse engineering puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: like "you can do everything online on the CG website" and then came number shifting
 dbdr: yes, that was cool
 dbdr: extending the scope of what's possible
 Sasetesus: pizzapasta
 dbdr: *known to be possible&#160;:)
 Sasetesus: mandolino
 MartijnH: Anyway.. if you want some hints on Breach.. send me a pm
 AntiSquid: how to ignore it without use of adblocker&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol

 joeltonyf: Missed Ocean of Code&#160;:( how was it?
 Quidome: thrilling
 Nerchio: ooc was gooood
 joeltonyf: Level of competition very high as it was a month long contest?

 Celal: how can l delete this chat from right absolutely? l want delete absolutely this
 JBM: you want to delete us? 
 JBM: nice
 ZarthaxX: savage
 Astrobytes: Press the arrow, or append ?disableChat to the url
 Astrobytes: And good day to you too, sir.
 AntiSquid: for a really ferocious way of deleting the chat, install adblock plus origin, minimize this chat and right click on the chat bar and then block element, repeat the right click and block until there's nothing left of the chat bar space
 AntiSquid: Celal
 Astrobytes: Or just hit that big X in the corner
 Astrobytes: Got 2 more btw AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: i guess you can request a ban before doing that? maybe that helps Celal&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 2 more what Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Test cases solved
 AntiSquid: lol ... i am trying to fix my UTG
 AntiSquid: did you solve the 2nd one&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I still can't bear to look at that
 Astrobytes: UTG that is
 AntiSquid: why do you do it then?
 Astrobytes: No, 3rd and 4th
 AntiSquid: CR / cystal rush
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah, whatever you wanna call it I still can't face it
 AntiSquid: i missread your msg, thought you wrote what is UTG
 AntiSquid: it's very random indeed, you need a much stronger bot than the average user to progress otherwise you won't feel any sense of progression
 AntiSquid: or rather moreprecise bot 
 Celal: this chat part hinter me  to move my coding part
 AntiSquid: i told you how to do it
 Astrobytes: So did I
 AntiSquid: can you read Celal&#160;?
 Celal: l know english not perfekt:innocent:
 AntiSquid: ok 
 Astrobytes: You can hide the chat Celal, the white arrow below
 AntiSquid: click the  &gt;  arrow at the bottom of the chat
 Celal: but arrow stay here , for open chat to right
 Uljahn: that's more a triangle btw :smirk:
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: celal 
 Astrobytes: OK, to disable it: add ?disableChat at the end of the URL
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: hey dude how r u
 Astrobytes: Details Uljahn, details :P
 Uljahn: .chat-wrapper {display: None!important} works for me too
 AntiSquid: DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7 translate to him to install adblock plus and block the chat element on the website
 Uljahn: also that 3rd testcase in breach made me laugh
 Astrobytes: I wasn't laughing
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: celal qaqa deyir adblock yukle
 Astrobytes: I figured it out from testcase 4 
 Uljahn: me too
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i regret mentioning breach in chat lol
 Celal: AntiSquid l won't install that program:grin::joy:
 Uljahn: why
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: what are you talking about guys
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: why does he have to install it 
 Celal: DarkCubeVon ne uzun adin var ay qa
 Uljahn: it's nice for those clever cats who can't code

 AntiSquid: i offered a possibility
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: Baki muhendislikde oxuyuram mende

 AntiSquid: we are just being helpful DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7
 Uljahn: just deal with the chat then :slight_smile:
 Celal:  ehtiyat tanisim deyilsenki?:joy:
 Astrobytes: you don't even need the =true
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: Anti Squid he understands you. if he wants it he'll solve it
 AntiSquid: then why the fuck does he nag us about it DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7&#160;? he asked us for help

 AntiSquid: i use C once in a blue moon, so probably not
 Astrobytes: Practice. 
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: sorry?
 AntiSquid: i rarely use it
 Astrobytes: For instance, solving puzzles on here using C, to improve your skills
 AntiSquid: use stackoverflow or google to find answers to your C based questions
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: Thank you Astrobytes, thank you AntiSquid
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: yes thats a good idea

 AntiSquid: which one of the gods?
 AntiSquid: i am picky on which diety is allowed to bless me
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: the god is one&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i accept one's blessing then
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: i call him as a muslim Allah
 Durkin: damn, I really hoping it'd be more zeus vibes
 AntiSquid: i am not religious
 DarkCubeVonKirschenwald_2da7: i respect 
 AntiSquid: for breach 3 and 4 are chemistry tables&#160;?&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 AntiSquid: seriously?
 Astrobytes: :zipper_mouth:
 AntiSquid: lol they are ... 
 eulerscheZahl: SPOILER
 Uljahn: ban
 AntiSquid: retarded puzzle
 AntiSquid: it's just guess work
 eulerscheZahl: and now: guess why i stopped
 Astrobytes: I don't mind the puzzles themselves, but as I said, it seriously does not suit this format
 AntiSquid: i only looked at the input because people were talking about it
 AntiSquid: and i still remember chemical symbols from school ... but someone with no interest in chemistry would struggle
 AntiSquid: the general gist i got from first looking at the puzzle was some CTF related stuff 
 Astrobytes: Which would be fine if we were in a CTF environment.
 Astrobytes: I'm half expecting a steganography testcase where I need to output a full jpeg or something by hand
 eulerscheZahl: there is your stegano image: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/challenge/img/residue.png">http://www.hacker.org/challenge/img/residue.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Challenge 'Filtration Residue' [Crypto]
 Astrobytes: I've not been on that site in years, forgotten my details and was with an old email. Might have to re-register, does everything still work?
 AntiSquid: doubt it wil lget that exciting, #5 is obviously reverse ascii art :D
 eulerscheZahl: a few parts are broken now&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: using legacy technology such as java applets, good luck playing that in your browser
 eulerscheZahl: and the forum was dead for a while, seems to be up again
 Astrobytes: Ah, shame. Maybe they'll update it one day
 AntiSquid: close to figuring #2 out, i bet it's something really lame
 AntiSquid: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94dafb7c-a22e-48ec-a795-6dcf7da7d7d5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94dafb7c-a22e-48ec-a795-6dcf7da7d7d5</a>
 Astrobytes: I'm close on #6
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you solved the ss_f one :o
 AntiSquid: did you notice the letters are just a portion of the alpabet&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i have an idea...
 dbdr: seems you guys love to hate it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: this was stupid
 eulerscheZahl: and the ss_f code solved rs_f too? not sure if i got lucky or if it is the same
 alvanrahimli: Hi! Can you suggest some problems to solve for beginners?
 dbdr: alvanrahimli there is an "easy" section in puzzles
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>

 Astrobytes: Ah yeah I s ee the ss_f one now
 icecream17: oh that puzzle is amazing
 AntiSquid: what? which one?
 icecream17: Breach
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach</a>
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes did you solve #2? think of the dumbest and easiest solution
 AntiSquid: icecream17 we were just talking about how stupid it is
 Astrobytes: wtf it's the same shit
 AntiSquid: same shit as what?
 icecream17: It was really hard for me to figure out 1 and 2, but I did it! I don't understand 3 yet though
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid the same method to solve rs_f
 AntiSquid: lol see what i meant when i said earlier it's dumb?
 Astrobytes: Yuuup
 AntiSquid: #3 #4 are easy depending on personal preferences IceDemonOfDeath_cdf4
 AntiSquid: icecream17
 icecream17: I'm gonna try the ascii/unicode for gs_m...
 AntiSquid: rs_f isn't solve for me&#160;:/
 icecream17: Just [redacted]. Really easy
 AntiSquid: ah , i didn't add the elif rs_f yet
 Astrobytes: that would explain it&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: seriously
 icecream17: btw, Did the IDE font change for js?
 Astrobytes: No. The IDE changed.
 AntiSquid: for everything
 AntiSquid: icecream17 tell me the input for #3 or #4 and i can tell you what it is
 icecream17: Standard Error Stream:[ 'gs_m: Unauthorized', 'Need Symbol: 114' ]
 icecream17: don't me though
 icecream17: don't tell
 AntiSquid: ok should i describe it?
 eulerscheZahl: Fl
 eulerscheZahl: that's the answer
 icecream17: I'm guessing String.fromCharCode(code)
 AntiSquid: it's super heavy 
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Uljahn: just running test 4 several times gives enough hints
 AntiSquid: and artificial
 eulerscheZahl: probably won't last long
 AntiSquid: but it was my first thought when running #3, i was thinking it can't be that! it can't be that would be ...
 eulerscheZahl: 3 and 4 are reverse to each other
 eulerscheZahl: oh, was mentioned before
 icecream17: Augh, what could it be? So not ascii/unicode...
 Astrobytes: Look at 4
 icecream17: "In" is it the....
 icecream17: crevbqvp gnoyr? (rot13)
 icecream17: Va = VaqvhzLrnu, V xabj zl ryrzragf
 Astrobytes: :zipper_mouth:
 icecream17: First try =D
 AntiSquid: which one is that? 
 AntiSquid: #5&#160;? #7&#160;?
 Astrobytes: 4
 AntiSquid: ah lol
 AntiSquid: icecream17 heavy spoiler to the entire puzzle: don't overthink, instead of expecting much, expect very little of it
 eulerscheZahl: yeah you got it icecream17
 eulerscheZahl: have fun finding a copy-paste ready table or typing it yourself
 icecream17: Wow. This expert puzzle is harder than some easy puzzles....
 AntiSquid: please
 Astrobytes: I found a table separated by tabs and spaces, then just find/replaced into a nice format
 AntiSquid: when i was in school the bottom ones where called something else
 Astrobytes: Lots of changes over the years
 AntiSquid: ununquadium for example
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they finally found some names
 icecream17: Tennessine, Oganesson. [Dysprosium, Oxygen]
 eulerscheZahl: i still have a physical version from my days back in schoolstops at 111 (112 is there but without a name)
 AntiSquid: the real challenge is space maze obv, only 3 people solved it wtf&#160;?
 AntiSquid: need to do that at some point 
 eulerscheZahl: we should move it to the easy section so more people try it. then the solver count can go up :thinking:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Has it been PotW yet?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 AntiSquid: potw&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle of the week
 AntiSquid: ah
 eulerscheZahl: took me some guesswork and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=potw">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=potw</a> to get it
 Astrobytes: lol, sorry for the confusion
 AntiSquid: instantly started thinking of corona patients
 mark7: my first line in javascript code is "r=readline"it gives error "r is not defined why??"
 eulerscheZahl: var r?
 eulerscheZahl: nah, should do without
 mark7: it normally works
 mark7: I dont know why its not working in power of thor
 Astrobytes: Paste your code here mark7
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are the one who invited me to clash of code an hour ago
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/026836f7-1805-4caf-8cd0-f178161010b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/026836f7-1805-4caf-8cd0-f178161010b1</a>
 mark7: eulerscheZahl yer
 mark7: yes*
 Astrobytes: readline()&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: then i will not open this code
 mark7: eulerscheZahl you can open,
 eulerscheZahl: now, i'm mad
 mark7: Astrobytes that calls the function i want to create refernce to that function
 mark7: eulerscheZahl why?
 AntiSquid: you could even drop the var
 Astrobytes: oh you're codegolfing
 AntiSquid: no idea though mark7, ask on discord
 mark7: AntiSquid I got it
 struct: Thor never goes North
 mark7: Bcoz i used that array to variable thing in next line with brackets it was not working
 mark7: just adding ';' at the end worked
 mark7: struct&#160;?
 struct: You are doing the thor puzzle right?
 mark7: yes
 struct: he never needs to go north
 mark7: thanks...
 Uljahn: could inviting people to clash be considered a form of harassment? :thinking:
 JBM: certainly
 struct: I just cant undersand why there is no option to disable it
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't have to be informed every time someone decides to follow me
 eulerscheZahl: my last pings, most recent first:CFSFPPFCFCCCWFFFFSFFSSSFFSFWFFFFPFSFWLF...
 eulerscheZahl: c=clash, f=follow, s=solution comment, w=puzzle of the week
 struct: If I unfollow and follow back, does it ping again?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: but not the unfollow
 struct: stil
 eulerscheZahl: did it work?
 struct: yes
 JBM: people comment solutions?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 times?
 struct: only pinged 1 time
 struct: and only 1 notification
 eulerscheZahl: i combined solution comments with comments on comments
 eulerscheZahl: as C was taken for CoC
 eulerscheZahl: so when i comment on a pending puzzle...
 AntiSquid: - ss_con: series, state machine, 1
 LoGos: Hi eulerscheZahl. Could I ask you which algorithm are you using in Bandas?
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo tree search
 LoGos: me too
 eulerscheZahl: others above me do the same but with higher rollout count
 eulerscheZahl: some might be minimax
 eulerscheZahl: robo has a neural network i think
 LoGos: I just submitted pure mcts and I am just behind you
 LoGos: that sounds nice
 AntiSquid: nvm
 eulerscheZahl: almost like we had the same idea :D
 LoGos: yeah :laughing:
 eulerscheZahl: are you using bitboards?
 LoGos: yes. Bitsets in c++ to be specific
 LoGos: Its easier to start with
 eulerscheZahl: i see. again a similarity
 LoGos: Heh. Bandas is such a nice contest to use bitboards
 LoGos: you can do every move with it
 eulerscheZahl: i still need a few cycles for one pushing action
 eulerscheZahl: when you push many opponents with a single one of your units
 LoGos: same

 Astrobytes: Output is just one char AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: but it says: ss_con: series, state machine, 1
 Astrobytes: the 1 is the char count
 AntiSquid: so i expect to do a series of outputs&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: It's the worst statement ever
 Astrobytes: Well, it's up there
 struct: Yavalath has the worst statement ever
 AntiSquid: wait did you solve #6 or not Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: No not yet, just come back to it after a break
 AntiSquid: maybe one day we have a contest like this&#160;?
 AntiSquid: *what a brilliant idea*
 struct: I wish they really added timebank&#160;:(
 Uljahn: AntiSquid: like reverse engineering UTG rules by leaked replays?
 eulerscheZahl: or reverse engineering the fantastic bits game engine because the referee wasn't public? :D
 AntiSquid: no, something more like breachinput is a and you need to output A or b based on other random characters!
 struct: So long since I used SDK
 struct: First time I see a thing that looks like an ad on CG
 AntiSquid: what ad&#160;?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/EWg6Lze.png">https://i.imgur.com/EWg6Lze.png</a>
 AntiSquid: good it's not a CoC advert?
 eulerscheZahl: they are advertising the contest on tech.io
 eulerscheZahl: and that playground is actually embedded from there
 struct: Yeah
 struct: Their yuotube video has a few amount of views
 struct: 8.4k
 eulerscheZahl: not bad
 eulerscheZahl: curious about the prizes. might even be a little bigger considering the advertising
 AntiSquid: for #6 i think i also need to make the dots green but no idea what exactly i need to look for
 Astrobytes: yes AntiSquid, I'm trying a few things rn along those lines
 Astrobytes: Well, inbetween my internet cutting out that is
 Nerchio: my minmax in bandas is so dumb xD
 Illedan: Same eulerscheZahl. Might be the difference between me taking 1 or 3 days off work :P
 AntiSquid: well the design is exactly the same as Namco for the pacman they took down, interesting coincidence right? maybe it's sponsored by Namco
 struct: Should be announced soon 
 AntiSquid: if it is big
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan why not both?
 AntiSquid: Namco Ltd. was a Japanese developer and publisher o
 AntiSquid: was nvm
 eulerscheZahl: and 2 as well, it's between the other two options
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/">https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/</a> is it this one?
 AntiSquid: if that's the sponsor everyone should change to anime avatar in the spirit of the contest

 Nerchio: my minmax was broke i was calling max from a max xD
 jacek: aww
 Nerchio: now it clearly can see its going to lose&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: looks pretty:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/441380/PACMAN_CHAMPIONSHIP_EDITION_2/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/441380/PACMAN_CHAMPIONSHIP_EDITION_2/</a>
 Illedan: So 4 days? :P
 Illedan: Might as well do all 5 days then ^^
 Nerchio: so bandas is not a balanced game right? you might be lost since the start
 struct: What is written bellow arcade?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/dN8A2hw.png">https://i.imgur.com/dN8A2hw.png</a>
 jacek: so is onitama. they both start quite randomly
 AntiSquid: bracket
 struct: ty
 AntiSquid: where did you get that from

 Nerchio: lol illedan
 Nerchio: 2v10
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/455371506">https://www.codingame.com/replay/455371506</a>
 struct: Interesting the title says (2)
 struct: Does it mean there are 2 more?
 AntiSquid: it's pacman 2, that's it i think, a very loud game
 AntiSquid: bomb jumps woot
 AntiSquid: ya completely different from regular pacman
 AntiSquid: ghost train lmao
 Nerchio: you guys found the challenge?
 struct: Im just wondering how 1vs1 pacman works
 AntiSquid: uhm, i am just guessing 
 eulerscheZahl: if we would find it, we wouldn't tell it here but report it
 eulerscheZahl: except for Benjamin, he shares replays
 AntiSquid: guessing the sponsor is bandainamco since the offer pacman 2 for free atm on steam and they have a contest around the same time
 AntiSquid: and pacman 2 has crazy new rules
 AntiSquid: but there are no powerups like in the cover image
 AntiSquid: so hard to tell exact contest
 AntiSquid: maybe they troll us with the cover and it's something else 
 struct: Risk move
 AntiSquid: well then some of my guesses have to be true
 AntiSquid: seems like pacman 2 has some sort of velocity, MadKnight are you in?
 Nerchio: noooooooooo no velocity pls
 aCat: :cry_cat:
 aCat: no physics please
 struct: So long since a physics game
 Uljahn: physics yes!
 struct: But it probably wont be
 struct: most likely
 Astrobytes: BR2K was fun! Can't see them doing a physics one tho
 eulerscheZahl: does code royale count as physics?
 Astrobytes: Needless physics perhaps :smirk:
 AntiSquid: you should play the game, it's really cool
 Astrobytes: Code Royale?
 AntiSquid: the ghost train btw:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/ItQ79A9">https://imgur.com/a/ItQ79A9</a>
 AntiSquid: that's just pacman 2 from steam btw .
 Uljahn: at first i thought about training ghost to fight by your side
 AntiSquid: lol like pokemans
 Astrobytes: 5 players and you swap roles
 hozayfeh: Hello
 Astrobytes: Hi
 struct: It must be championship edition 2
 struct: Its free until 10 may
 eulerscheZahl: matches with the contest start
 eulerscheZahl: the cg contest got delayed...
 eulerscheZahl: was that game delayed too?
 struct: idk
 struct: But contest delay was long ago
 Astrobytes: Hard to make a connection since it's the PacMan anniversary anyway
 AntiSquid: really cool game though, you need to play it
 VadimRusakov: Hello guys! I'm newcomer on this site. Can anyone give me advice, which bot is good to start? I just wanna check, how all it works, not wanna spend all my free time. Thx!
 eulerscheZahl: OS: Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit OS required)i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: if you like simple rules, try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough</a>
 Nerchio: give him something interesting please
 Nerchio: xD
 aCat: Ultimate TTT&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: code of ice and fire is a good compromise between simple and interesting i think
 aCat: really&gt;
 stacked: how do i just use a text editor instead of a full-blown IDE
 aCat: it's overcomplicated for me 
 eulerscheZahl: mean max is you want a complicated physics engine
 Astrobytes: LoCaM :smirk:
 stacked: i jsut want text
 aCat: Codebusters - always&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: fog of war :scream:
 aCat: but you don't care
 Astrobytes: Vindinium?
 eulerscheZahl: so many, just take one of them :D
 VadimRusakov: O'k, thanks! (saved)
 AntiSquid: imo this is simple, just if-else&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a>
 Astrobytes: Just try each one until you find something you like VadimRusakov&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: other simple interesting:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-of-kutulu">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-of-kutulu</a> VadimRusakov
 aCat: Eventually say what type of programming do you like - or even better - read the rules of the few ones and see what suit<i>s you best</i>
 aCat: damn - noone mentioned Tron oO
 eulerscheZahl: or watch replays
 AntiSquid: ya Astrobytes gave best advice, nobody can decide for you what you like
 Astrobytes: You did aCat :P
 aCat: yes - replays may be even better
 aCat: ^^'
 aCat: for physics Quiddich may be more fun than madmax
 Astrobytes: aka Fantastic Bits
 aCat:&#160;:* this cat thanks you
 Astrobytes: Your a wizard aCat :P
 Astrobytes: *You're
 Astrobytes: Are you gonna make a game soon aCat?
 aCat: btw what was the name for this full graphics puzzle?
 aCat: maybe a game, maybe a puzzle but with graphics
 Astrobytes: Cool
 aCat: what I really want to do is a full-fledged contest
 aCat: not a middlesteps&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: As long as you prepare and organise everything CG will do it
 Astrobytes: So they said, at least
 aCat: yeah, so I need a team ;p
 Astrobytes: Ask for volunteers/contributers/testers
 aCat: Will do
 Astrobytes: Maybe post on the Discord and forum
 aCat: after I will remind myself SDK, survive contest, and a few deadlines ;p
 Astrobytes: Hehe, busy schedule eh&#160;:)
 aCat: yeah
 aCat: Had 5 papers to review for CoG ;p
 AntiSquid: acat create duel disks with holograms like in yugioh anime lol
 Astrobytes: Only 5 :P Nice 
 aCat: only
 Astrobytes: :D
 aCat: damn you bad human beaing
 aCat: worst
 aCat: they were mostly not good quality&#160;;/
 Astrobytes: I was just gonna ask, were they good lol
 Astrobytes: Painful experience then
 aCat: one was nice, one informative but not much of their own contribution 
 aCat: rest bleh
 Astrobytes: 1/5 is OK. Have you read any scientific journals recently? :P So much crap.
 aCat: except the things I was reviewing ;p
 aCat: probably not xD
 aCat: I should have to catch up on some bunch of papers
 aCat: Not ask Radek to read them for me :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 aCat: (lazy cat)
 Astrobytes: Nothing wrong with that&#160;:)
 Nerchio: unleash the geek was so popular because it was sponsored?
 Astrobytes: There was a big prize iirc Nerchio
 struct: I can help if you want
 Astrobytes: That and it was easy to get started
 struct: I still think I remember a few things about sdk
 Nerchio: i mean i didnt play but it looks cool
 Nerchio: lots of people played too
 struct: The only reason I dont use SDK a lot is lack of ideas
 Uljahn: there was a private hackathon prior to contest
 Nerchio: 7500 contestants and only 90ppl in legend ;o
 AntiSquid: oh yeah UTG had good prizes :o
 AntiSquid: lol Nerchio that's number of people signed up
 aCat: I have nooo problem with ideas ;p
 Nerchio: antisquid i know but comparatively to ooc its still small number
 AntiSquid: number of arena bots is lower
 AntiSquid: and number of people that don't quit in wood / bronze even lower
 Nerchio: 2300 ooc / 64 legend
 AntiSquid: code a la mode had a humongous legend
 Nerchio: and this is like 7500/90
 Uljahn: ah those numbers, reminds me of D voting support
 Nerchio: i need to try some multiagent game too :p
 struct: Still hardest legend to this day
 struct: Is bit runner
 AntiSquid: botters Nerchio
 Uljahn: uttt in python
 Nerchio: bit runner is a team game&#160;? what
 struct: no
 struct: 1vs1
 AntiSquid: there are no real team games
 struct: Code a la mode is coop
 Nerchio: bit runner 2048 by illedan
 Nerchio: ah ok was just confusing to look at since 1 guy has 2 colors and the other one the same
 Nerchio: im not sure if a 'team game' would be cool or a nightmare
 Nerchio: so you get paired with another random bot to 2v2
 Nerchio: not really pre-picked teams
 struct: Some people would not like it
 Astrobytes: Ooof trictrac top in TaD with 43.05 points!
 struct: I guess he started using search
 Astrobytes: Yes he switched to a minimax the other day
 Astrobytes: Are you playing anything atm struct?
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: Feeling uninspired?
 struct: Waiting for contest
 Astrobytes: *Waiting for last day of contest :P
 struct: I just hope Ill enjoy the contest
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you didn't like OOC right.What kind of contest (other than physics-based) would you prefer?
 struct: I dont really now, sometime I just struggle with some stuff, I keep trying to do the complicated stuff first
 struct: And lose motivation
 Astrobytes: Seems you need to stop doing that then
 Astrobytes: And work iteratively
 aCat: yeah... iteration one - rewrite the game engine ^^'
 struct: Probably what I have to do for Yinsh
 struct:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Yeah but the point was, optimise after you have something working 
 struct: My steps step1: write one linestep2: optimize it
 Astrobytes: That's why you keep getting bogged down and stuck :shrug:
 struct: true 
 Uljahn: my steps: optimize it.no code, just headache
 Uljahn: any clues on #6 breach?
 Astrobytes: meta-optimisation
 Astrobytes: I still haven't got it Uljahn, I'll go back to it tomorrow
 Uljahn: the last unsolved
 Astrobytes: Well played
 RoboStac: which ones 6?
 Uljahn: literal lock
 RoboStac: oh, that one
 Astrobytes: It seems to make sense, then it doesn't
 Uljahn: or you mean the breach puzzle :confused:
 RoboStac: what have you tried for it so far?
 Astrobytes: Trying to get the first colour G, removing all the reds, getting the second colour (the dots I presume) green
 Astrobytes: I'm guessing the lowercase ones must be all the same but not so sure for the uppercase ones
 RoboStac: the case isn't relevant at all, it's just to allow more colour codes
 Oioi: Hi. Did someone do the winamax challenge&#160;?
 Astrobytes: By lowercase I'm referring to the second colour in each term of the sequence
 Uljahn: second color is often r but sometimes g
 Astrobytes: Yes, and the g seems to fit btu not always
 Astrobytes: In terms of lighting up the dots
 Astrobytes: I gave myself a headache with this earlier
 RoboStac: it sounds like you've found everything you need to
 Uljahn: also that VO, if V is violet what is O
 Astrobytes: OK, I'll revisit it tomorrow with a clearer head&#160;;)
 Uljahn: me too
 Uljahn: the morning is wiser than the evening as they say here
 RoboStac: the O is just an O at the end to signal its open I think (it's not relevant in anyway)
 Uljahn: thx
 Astrobytes: yeah cheers Robo&#160;:+1:
 RoboStac: if you get stuck theres a massive hint for that one on the forum too
 Uljahn: ouch
 Astrobytes: meh, I'd prefer not to :D
 Uljahn: ah, there are turns in state machine
 Uljahn: jeez
 Astrobytes: That was messing me up earlier, that's why I stopped
 Uljahn: also i never watched replays, big mistake
 AntiSquid: so i was right, there are bloody turns
 Uljahn: "you are only expected to output a single character per turn on ss_con" - why don't just put it in the statement
 virgo: Hi
 Astrobytes: I figured that out from gs_m Uljahn
 virgo: I've joined today there, and seems great!
 Astrobytes: Well, it was a guess that the digit meant the length of char output
 AntiSquid: it's all my fault, i advertised that puzzle in the chat&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Where did you see that statement Uljahn?
 Uljahn: discussion tab
 struct: Whats next, stenography puzzles? 
 Astrobytes: Ach you fairy, trying to do it with no forum hints :D
 Uljahn: sorry
 AntiSquid: ECG prediction puzzle
 Uljahn: gn then&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: yeah I mentioned that earlier struct lol
 Astrobytes: I'll forgive you this time Uljahn&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: gn
 stacked: i lost the room chat 
 stacked: rip
 stacked: :no_mouth:
 Nerchio:&#160;?

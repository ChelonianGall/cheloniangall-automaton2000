 Wontonimo: hmm, it really looks by the way our bot is behaving that you are using code copied from the internet without even making small modifications to it
 traagel: what do you mean lol 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: traagel, you are breaking your mother's heart
 JeanpierCalderonPuente: 3 bots

 hentaisex: hello everyone
 hentaisex: i am new
 hentaisex: to clash of code
 hentaisex: what do i do on this website
 5DN1L: first, change your profile pic and account name to some more proper ones
 dee_vrma: Hello!
 hentaisex: ahh yes
 hentaisex: 5DN1L
 hentaisex: the same piece of shit you banned me across like 2 platforms
 5DN1L: I don't know who you are, but now I've banned you
 karburaator: it would've been funnier if you said 3* platforms 
 5DN1L: i wish i could
 5DN1L: i don't even know what the 2 platforms he referred to
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: all mods are the same person
 Automaton2000: can you create a new puzzle
 Jerrasterix: any bashers here&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: I have a doubt 
 Jerrasterix: What's wrong with for i in {1..100};do node cli.js "Life Cycle and Philosophy" $i%14;done;
 Jerrasterix: for i in {1..100};do node cli.js "Life Cycle and Philosophy" $i%14;done;

 Flaise: Man I hate that syntax so much. :sweat_smile:
 DevK45PhanIT: no
 118866545621533: get the liberals out of the usa
 Flaise: You want things to get better, you ask yourself what you're spending your time on, buddy.
 5DN1L: 118866545621533 Please stick to coding-related discussion here, thanks.
 The_Viky: i don't get this question...anybody help me
 5DN1L: not sure until we know what your question is
 The_Viky: what is thrust referring to?
 Thorcode: bruh
 The_Viky: ohh, i thought u all in the same game
 Flaise: The term "thrust" normally refers to force from a rocket.
 Thorcode: it just a name
 The_Viky: yeah, uk, that mad pod racing game 
 Flaise: In any case, Troubleshooting 101: change it and see what happens.
 The_Viky: k
 5DN1L: Higher thrust, your pod speeds up; lower thrust, your pod slows down
 The_Viky: ohkk
 Flaise: Negative thrust, your pod owes thrust to the bank
 Flaise: (I'm kidding)
 5DN1L: that is negative thrift :smirk:
 karburaator: thrift isn't a thing
 karburaator: there's acceleration and inertia 
 Masterdemon: guys , is there a way for me to check the hidden test case, sometimes i wonder where did i wrong
 5DN1L: not initially
 Flaise: I tried to accelerate my bank last week but they said no and kicked me out-ertia
 5DN1L: Masterdemon You'll have access to the hidden test cases (validators) at higher levels
 karburaator: try putting your money somewhere that beats inflation kek
 karburaator: 0.01% interest per year amazing lmao 
 5DN1L: Masterdemon For now, please read the relevant forum threads (if there are any) for a particular puzzle to see if other people face the same issue as you do
 Flaise: silver ;D
 karburaator: strictly physical :sunglasses:
 Flaise: Often it's hard to beat the real world
 Flaise: Except when the real world is made out of pain, it's better to just drink and retreat into video games. Because that totally solves everything. Temporarily.
 Flaise: Although if it's only temporary, it generally means you didn't do it enough.
 Masterdemon: thanks 5DN1L
 5DN1L:&#160;:)

 5DN1L: Hello
 5DN1L: Do you know any basics of any programming languages?
 Lonely_Master: i dont know any programming languages
 5DN1L: In that case, you have to look around the internet and pick one first. Learn the basics. Then come back here to practise.
 karburaator: dont pick at random, start with python 
 karburaator: simplest syntax 
 karburaator: and dynamic typing

 HoriMiyamura: Hallo gayz
 HoriMiyamura: *guys
 HoriMiyamura: well can there be new multi?
 HoriMiyamura: I mean official multi?
 5DN1L: Wait until next year when Thibaud comes back and you can ask him again
 HoriMiyamura: oh
 HoriMiyamura: I hope I don't see Escape again&#160;:(
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Uljahn: guess if enough people ignore escape event, CG staff will notice it
 jacek: :rofl:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: going to be big changes next year
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: when you buy a company, you wait a few months then get rid of all the embarrassing stuff
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: sayonara
 Automaton2000: yeah i'm pretty sure my bot is good
 HoriMiyamura: The problem with Escape is that there are more non-tech guys in the event, but then later ..., I don't think it is good for active account
 HoriMiyamura: is there any other sites that compete on AI?
 HoriMiyamura: well why is it too silent here?
 jacek: holidays :santa:
 jacek: but still there are quite a few multis here
 humanbeethoven: ho
 eulerscheZahl: soon RAIC will take place again (announced for february)
 eulerscheZahl: but they are more strict about cheating than CG
 dbf: my RAIC t-shirt is in the post office, but too much people there today&#160;:(
 wlesavo: dbf mine also already in post office, just in time to congrat me with kutulu legend :smiley:
 SametCekin: hello
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't heard about mine yet, but it has to enter the EU which takes time
 jacek: through poland eh
 eulerscheZahl: no, through the gas pipeline
 jacek: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: i can finally troll again
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have to pick up my tshirts at the post office, they send them directly to my house
 eulerscheZahl: or back to Russia if i'm not home when it arrives and they don't figure out how to push it into the mailbox
 eulerscheZahl: story of my kotlin heroes tshirt, i still don't even know how it would have looked like&#160;:(

 ninjadip: i have siri code for me
 noCapCaptain: feel free to crack open this website called "keyhero" if you wanna find out and have some fun hahah
 ninjadip: is it a key generator
 ninjadip: cause that would be an awesome name for one
 ninjadip: "oh man! this program needs a key, and I just want to try it first" "no problemo! KeyHero is here!" lmao
 noCapCaptain: hahaha they gotta hire you for marketing
 ninjadip: just have to decide if the mascot is like a giant key or a person with all the keys, or some kind of sentient floating numbers thing
 jacek: i think i got this atari go thing, now the ko rule is left
 CyberShiva: hi
 CyberShiva: im new to coding game
 CyberShiva: i joined clash game
 CyberShiva: it was amazing...
 5DN1L: Good&#160;:)
 ninjadip: yes its so fun
 ninjadip: i'm new as well
 ninjadip: right now i'm hooked like a madman on this pod racing, talk about how to make coding fun
 jacek: coding? fun? oO
 ninjadip: except rewriting this drift steering calculation better
 ninjadip: fun, not fun
 Miki09: Should I report when i saw someone cheating in clash?
 ninjadip: ugh
 BlaiseEbuth: What's "cheating in clash"?
 eulerscheZahl: python compression?
 Miki09: they posted solution
 Miki09: in chat
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 ninjadip: think of it asa clue
 ninjadip: because they already won
 ninjadip: lol
 eulerscheZahl: that's not allowed indeed. maybe mods know what to do in such a case
 Miki09: coc2662412
 eulerscheZahl: #coc2662412
 ninjadip: oh brother..
 Miki09: I havent seen it in chat and i lost&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: O'brother? You're a man of constant sorrow?
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, why is there a mod badge at my nick?
 ninjadip: more melancholy
 BlaiseEbuth: Weekly chat crash heh...
 eulerscheZahl: didn't i promise to kick blaise if i should regain power?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah! Hit me! 
 eulerscheZahl: i left CG discord, can someone file a bug report?
 ninjadip: i'll take a hit too
 Q12: I'm working on "CGFunge Prime" and I have to say it's really fun:grinning:, thank you eulerscheZahl for this!
 eulerscheZahl: you're welcome. sadly i failed to test more numbers, so top solutions don't actually check for primes at all
 eulerscheZahl: i think miller-rabin would have been the way to go otherwise. or a list of all primes on stack
 eulerscheZahl: up to sqrt(n)
 Q12: yeah
 Q12: I am solving it in the simple way. starting from Math.min(the number itself, highest number I can reach before 3000) and going down in the loop until 2 (included) checking every time if it can be divided
 Q12: what I love about this puzzle is that you also need to structure your code to optimize more the speed
 eulerscheZahl: my first approach was starting at i=2 and increasing until i*i &gt; n
 eulerscheZahl: doing trial division at each step. got a score &gt; 100k with this
 eulerscheZahl: initially it was intended as a puzzle just to pass all tests. but during review it was suggested to make it an optim
 Q12: The points are the total number of actions you did in all testcases?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: I thought a little about it but didn't found a simple way to hardcode validators in less actions than my legit solution...
 eulerscheZahl: binary tree
 eulerscheZahl: is n &gt; 4000? nois n &gt; 500? yesis n &gt; 1200?
 eulerscheZahl: and optimize the tree in a way that it split up evenly (for the validators provided)
 eulerscheZahl: you can also group some numbers when there a some primes without a non-prime in the middle
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote a program to generate an optimal tree and then manually fitted it into the grid
 eulerscheZahl: was a bit of a fight to get it in the 40x30 area
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah that's what I did, but my try wasn't satisfying. But I didn't tried a lot...
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yeah, that was a great puzzle.  a shame you don't plan to generate more IP for them
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder regularly hosts optim contests, maybe i'll suggest a game one day. but currently i don't even have an idea for a game
 eulerscheZahl: maybe topcoder would even give a small recognition in return, no idea
 jbollman7: Any tips for Unary? I have C and CC done but it expects a 0 prefix for binary representation of "%". 
 STALKER_HEART_OF_CHERNOBIL:  b HEeLOOO ABTOBUS
 BlaiseEbuth: RTFS!
 5DN1L: ^ his advice to you, jbollman7 
 BlaiseEbuth: The better advice of all...
 eulerscheZahl: 5DN1L is no new, he doesn't even know what "pulling a ceg" means&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that's equivalent to not reading the statement, making assumptions, then asking questions that are clearly answered and getting mad when you reply to read the statement

 Assasint: Yes it is useless
 eulerscheZahl: we lack an option between kick and ban
 Assasint: And what
 eulerscheZahl: and bot contests
 Assasint: What is with you
 5DN1L: Don't harass the users here or you'll be banned
 Astrobytes: Yeah, a customisable timed temporary ban would be handy
 Astrobytes:  /ban user -t 180 etc
 5DN1L: Agreed

 eulerscheZahl: so you want to write a web crawler in C# and scan job portals?
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Illedan: lol
 WipsDev: that is a good one&#160;!!
 eulerscheZahl: on a more serious note: unlikely that this chat will help you get one. or even the CG website in general, they are focused on France
 ninjadip: who's mom?
 WipsDev: Damm frenchs ...
 Illedan: You can move to Franch though
 eulerscheZahl: it might however help to mention that you are active on websites such as CG, github, stackoverflow, ... when applying. just to stand out and get the edge over other candidates
 WipsDev: yes, that´s why i am working on Vox codei 2. To have something to show to a recluiter 
 WipsDev: i mean, i have a dev job, but i am searching for a better one 
 zakacat: I lived in Franch once
 VizGhar: I'll be looking for new job too :P I hate leaving my colleagues behind, but there are offers paying twice as much...
 WipsDev: And how can be that twice&#160;?
 VizGhar: I'm from slovakia... I just need to look abroad and voila :D
 WipsDev: hahahaha that looks not too much ..

 JulienBrouille: thanks
 CatboyCodes: what does Validator mean in new contribution?
 5DN1L: Validators are the hidden test cases.
 CatboyCodes: oh ok
 CatboyCodes: so it is not required?
 5DN1L: They are required. And they should be different from the test cases.
 CatboyCodes: k
 CatboyCodes: thx for letting me know

 5DN1L: Erm... Ose? You've finished 3 clashes so far?
 CatboyCodes: why is it saying: Mismatch with the stub generator input: Invalid value. Expected: 'A positive or negative number'. Received: 
 Ose: I feel too tired to explain that
 Ose: Actually Josiah can fix that
 5DN1L: That means the types of inputs your stub generator expects to receive are different from the types of inputs actually provided by the test cases, CatboyCodes
 Ose: Josiah said something diffrent
 CatboyCodes: so what changes do I have to make
 5DN1L: make them match
 CatboyCodes: so 21 and 21?
 Ose: That what Josiah said
 5DN1L: i mean make the types match
 CatboyCodes: oh ok
 Ose: :thumbsup_tone4:
 CatboyCodes: can I have an example?
 Ose: 3 and -3 my brother said he's a master at maths
 Josiah120: :joy:
 Josiah120: what?
 5DN1L: There's an example in the link I gave you earlier, CatboyCodes
 CatboyCodes: k
 Josiah120: did i
 Ose: Josiah, you never know what happened in the past
 Josiah120: Ok, I am a master of maths but why?
 Josiah120: what?
 Ose: You said
 Josiah120: okokokoko
 Ose: So I follow
 Ose: Deal
 Josiah120: ok

 Ose: Bye
 artcypher: guys can recommend game to do beside coders strike back (mad pod)?
 Ose: Mad pod I completed
 Ose: Maybe I can help you with the code 
 Ose: But not now
 artcypher: no, i need game recommendation, something as good as mad pod
 Schwase: search race is pretty similar to map pod
 Astrobytes: why not continue with CSB and try to get legend?

 jacek: code of kutulu?
 Astrobytes: ^ good choice
 jacek: or game of drones hm? or ghost in the cell?
 Astrobytes: depends if they want a grid or not I guess
 jacek: grid? like on paper?
 Astrobytes: :rolling_eyes:
 jacek: apparently when you crash referee its a draw
 Astrobytes: which game?
 Astrobytes: oh, Atari Go 9x9
 jacek: who approved it then :unamused:
 Astrobytes: Not I
 AntiSquid: Approved by trictrac dbdr field3 
 AntiSquid: so much for the "unique enough" rule, since there are 2 GO games
 NewNewb: Is this a decent place to learn to code or should I start with basic knowledge? 
 5DN1L: You should start with basic knowledge
 NewNewb: Where would y'all recommend learning?

 ninjadip: finally gettin promoted to gold league, finally got the math right for the drift factor
 jacek: -3vel?
 Ose: You could be very lucky when you get to gold league
 ninjadip: what do u mean
 ninjadip: i got to rank #2 in silver
 Ose: You nearly promoted to gold league you said
 ninjadip: all the way from #22000 after fixing that math
 ninjadip: i am getting promoted, already announced
 Ose: wow
 Ose: ok
 ninjadip: was over complicating it... i deleted like half of my code. and now i'm golden
 Ose: Good job!!
 Ose: :innocent:
 ninjadip: i still wonder if 90 degrees is the ideal cutoff for angle to thrust
 ninjadip: oh man i'm soooo pscyched!! i've spent hours the past 2 days trying to figure out why the drift correction wasn't working right
 Ose: hmm
 ninjadip: and now it seems obvious
 VizGhar: jacek solved Ko-Rule? :P
 Ose: Okay.
 ninjadip: the only thing i could really add would be to target other players to purposefully knock them out the way with shields instead of a defensive shield strategy that i have now
 Ose: Well I'm going to do another clash
 ninjadip: lets go
 jacek: VizGhar eeyup
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 jacek: for now the bot is so inefficient
 jacek: meh at some point the game effectively ends and both players can only pass <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/599316281">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/599316281</a>
 jacek: the referee should cut this
 Ose: bye
 VizGhar: This is mentioned in rules jacek: The game does not end after both players have passed (the game ends after 80 turns)
 jacek: on higher leagues its 200
 jacek: as i understand in normal go 2 passes is the end
 jacek: reasoning could be so 2 dumb bots wouldnt finish the game one after another
 VizGhar: ah... yeah I'm in wood3... this rule isnt updated
 VizGhar: I believe this game can be done using NNs...
 jacek: more likely by CNNs
 VizGhar: maybe. I've only started reading some papers so I know very little about any types of NNs
 VizGhar: So far only trying to understand ANNs. Those are pretty easy until I hit the backpropagation/learning
 jacek: so, MLP
 jacek: understanding NNs is one thing. training them and using them in useful situations is the another thing
 VizGhar: I know&#160;:| but not sure where to start... I'll probably just use it 100-200 times using some python -&gt; tensor flow tutorial and then try to understand the training process
 VizGhar: I'm a bit scared of linear algebra used by pros. I need something inefficient first
 jacek: to be frank i dont use algebra much, at least not in theoretic way. i just write for loops to mulitply some arrays until it works :v
 VizGhar: :D yeah... to that is tutorial I'm looking for
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I notice Euros tend to know more abstract algebra than we Americans.  Which is very unusual on any topic, you must have three years of it in middle school or somethig
 VizGhar: I basically read:Neuron sums weighted inputs and produces output applying some function (sigmoid / ReLU) on the SUM. So I look into code and there is some (for me) crazy matrix multiplication
 VizGhar: Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker yeah I've had Linear algebra in HS and Uni, but nobody was able to show us real applications
 VizGhar: So after 9 years out of Uni... well...
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Oh, we are better at linear, I was thinking rings and groups and all that
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: :P
 VizGhar: aha. I didn't get you. yeah we are more "abstract based" :D
 jacek: i have WIP for nns <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/4a1e9d9bd4b24f2a128257bc0b87604e13695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs">https://tech.io/playgrounds/4a1e9d9bd4b24f2a128257bc0b87604e13695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs</a>
 VizGhar: wow jacek, looks helpful. tnx
 jacek: ah image uses w11, w21 while code uses w1,w2,w3...
 VizGhar: Thats something I'm able to figure out. Yeah so that is the code for absolute idiots. I need that :D
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Didn't Marchettte make a NN for dummies for one of the problems?  Been meaning to try that
 VizGhar: and finally seeing those (from beginning) mysterious biases
 jacek: ok, updated. i think its correct
 VizGhar: You think it's published Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker&#160;? I'd try to find it
 jacek: marchete made functional nn tutorial for oware
 jacek: a0 style

 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 VizGhar: NNs are my new year's resolution&#160;:)
 jacek: mine is 1920x1200
 VizGhar: :nerd:
 jacek: as for biases, it took me quite some time to realize they are trained just like normal weights except the 'input' is always 1
 jacek: interesting. when i submitted that crashing code, only the non-crashed battles are visible
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Has there been any more leaderboard cleanup?  Seems like that is going to be a very slow unfolding drama
 Astrobytes: heh
 Astrobytes: remains to be seen if the other games are 'cared about' enough
 jacek: what game
 Astrobytes: GitC
 jacek: whats wrong with it
 jacek: is this euler dupes detector?
 Astrobytes: Nothing, leaderboard was full of copied github bots, it got cleaned up
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Astrobytes: But there were at least another 4 games that were terrible...
 Astrobytes: GitC is someones favourite game you see
 ____Z_X_C____: help
 ____Z_X_C____: how come this code doesnt work?
 ____Z_X_C____: n=input()print(n.translate({'9':'0','8':'1','7':'2','6':'4'}))
 ____Z_X_C____:&#160;????
 ____Z_X_C____: help
 ninjadip: i don't understand, it's not translating right
 ____Z_X_C____:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: you need to use the unicode num instead of '9'or '7'
 Wontonimo: use ord('9') to get it's unicode number
 ninjadip: hey wontonimoi@
 ninjadip: i got to the gold level today, i got that drift calculation all figured out and took out half of the other code that was over complicating everything
 Wontonimo: nice
 ninjadip: yeah, felt good to that math without any help from ppl or the internet
 ninjadip: that debug mode helped me figure it out, thanks for showing me that
 Wontonimo: ____Z_X_C____try thisprint(n.translate({ord('9'):'0',ord('8'):'1',ord('7'):'2',ord('6'):'4'}))
 ____Z_X_C____: thanks
 ____Z_X_C____: i tried already
 ____Z_X_C____: clash ended
 Wontonimo: cool ninjadip , really great feeling when i solve something myself
 ninjadip: i already have a strategy to try in the gold level, almost like tag lol
 Wontonimo: ah, your gold bot is broken
 ninjadip: but need to take a break from pod racing and sit on my spoils
 Wontonimo: do you want help fixing that?
 ninjadip: no, it's broke on purpose, i just pasted my old code and the new auto generated code together, i'll sort it out later
 Wontonimo: cool
 ninjadip: just submitted it to save it
 Wontonimo: you have access to previous submits in the history
 ninjadip: oh i don't know how to do that
 ninjadip: i just did it old school lol
 Wontonimo: check it out
 ninjadip: i saw the reload and thats it
 Wontonimo: i've started to save my work locally also using git
 ninjadip: i'm going to try this code golf thing
 Wontonimo: yikes
 ninjadip: i need more practice at parsing to get faster and not have to think so much about it before i write it
 ninjadip: is that what this is about?
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: it is about writing code that uses the fewest characters as possible
 ninjadip: haven't read it all yet, just sitting there, while i am really enjoying my new headphones for christmas. maybe next christmas i'll get that new dac i want
 ninjadip: oh
 ninjadip: i'm bad at that
 ninjadip: so this will be good practice
 Wontonimo: let me see if i can find an example
 ninjadip: I have painfully taught myself to be only as concise as would be clear to the next person
 ____Z_X_C____: aa
 ____Z_X_C____: i forgot how to caculate percentage
 ____Z_X_C____: interval = input()
 ____Z_X_C____: help
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: first step to code golf is to realize you can do this
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: import os;os.system("ls -l")
 e_fishel: what is that
 ____Z_X_C____: something in python
 struct: he is making system calls 
 struct: to solve the puzzle
 ____Z_X_C____: o
 jacek: oO
 struct: jacek online at this time?
 struct: o.o
 jacek: struct did you know what happens when referee crashes
 struct: to the game result?
 struct: i have no idea if its handled as a draw
 jacek: in the arena there will be no games
 struct: oh
 OrsosAdam: Am I the only one, who only played clash of code from the whole codingame so far? :sweat_smile:
 struct: Dont think so OrsosAdam, it might not be very active around this time though
 OrsosAdam: Nah, I am having fun :D
 struct: but jacek did you have any more questions related to that?
 jacek: no, just bragging
 jacek: made PR in github but i think the guy wasnt online for long time
 struct: well anyone can reupload I think
 struct: does it have bosses?
 jacek: no in github&#160;:(
 struct: but in arena it has?
 struct: jacek when you press download in the contribution you will get the bosses
 struct: I guess he forgot to make it not downlodable
 jacek: where? i dont see it
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/529194ddf0a7b8c3dc01fc1b0b9189e69b22">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/529194ddf0a7b8c3dc01fc1b0b9189e69b22</a>
 jacek: oh
 jacek: how you tell me when im in wood1 :rage:
 OrsosAdam: Any one of you knows why that sometimes 100% goes down to a lower percentage after submit? 
 OrsosAdam: My 100% answer went to 25% after submit and I have no idea why...
 struct: probably poor test cases
 OrsosAdam: There are different testcases after and before submit? 
 struct: yes
 OrsosAdam: :joy: :joy: :joy:
 jacek: did you hardcode your solutions!?
 OrsosAdam: @jacek I did no such thing sir! Even the accusation feels offending!
 OrsosAdam: I never once in a lifetime hardcoded a solution, nor will I plan to. 
 struct: ill ban jacek, such offences are not tolerable
 OrsosAdam: Thank you! Much apprecitiated. May my honor shall be restored!
 OrsosAdam: I just hope such accussation doesnt reach my dear mother. Her heart wouldn't handle it well...
 jacek: Automaton2000 did you bitboard the go
 Automaton2000: not easy to do in the first 1s
 Astrobytes: even I'm still online
 Astrobytes: tbf though I just checked CG after going for a pi55
 jacek: pi55?
 jacek: ohhhhh
 Astrobytes: you work it out
 jacek: Automaton2000 what's pi55
 Automaton2000: i wanted to have a lot of cases
 Astrobytes: lol, gonna eat a sandwich or something, maybe one more whisky catch you guys later
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: and bye&#160;;)
 struct:&#160;:'(
 n0b1e: Hi guys how do you relieve body fatigue due to long coding sessions?
 Quillup: Is there a way to create your own test cases?
 n0b1e: Yeah quillup&#160;:) run some on your ide after copy pasting code copying parameters etxx
 Quillup: So not on the website 
 n0b1e: not that i know of
 n0b1e: test cases can change after submit and hard coded solutions do not work its test cases unique and given by codingame
 Quillup: Ok, I just started and I am doing  ascii art and I don't understand how my logic is solid for all the examples except "all of the uppercase letters" It would be so much easier to debug if I could test other things
 skotz: in the lower-right there's a "custom" tab that'll let you
 Bertinator: guys any idea on how to get started on a big coding project
 struct: Quillup you can debug
 struct: you can print to stderr
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: click custom in the IDE

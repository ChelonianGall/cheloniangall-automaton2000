 Codeab: hi guys
 Codeab: does anyone know how to highlight variables in the statement in contribution?
 Zenoscave: [[ ]]
 Zenoscave: wrap in those
 Zenoscave: I think
 Codeab: oh it works thanks
 eulerscheZahl: there's also <a href="/index.php?title=Template:Xxx&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Xxx (page does not exist)">Template:Xxx</a> for other highlighting
 eulerscheZahl: <a href="/index.php?title=Variable&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Variable (page does not exist)">variable</a><a href="/index.php?title=Template:Constant&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Constant (page does not exist)">Template:Constant</a>
 Codeab: &lt;&lt;bold&gt;&gt;
 Codeab:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i just click "edit" on another contribution that has the feature I want, then i see it :D
 vegeta1101: how to make some more test case visible while making the puzzle
 Codeab: click more test cases
 vegeta1101: okay thanks
 Codeab: guys what is the stub generator input
 vegeta1101: that is part that your code will generate for all lamguage
 Codeab: um what am i supposed to put in there&#160;???
 vegeta1101: stub generetor should at least take all require input
 vegeta1101: lets' say you need 2 variable 
 vegeta1101: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68b72557-b6dd-4ba5-89e0-395f50651b7b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68b72557-b6dd-4ba5-89e0-395f50651b7b</a>
 vegeta1101: and if you want to print some anserthen use 
 vegeta1101: hope this help
 Codeab: ohhhhhhhhhh ok now i get it
 Codeab: how bout a print statement
 Codeab: what does the number in the bracket do?
 Codeab: @vegrta1101?
 vegeta1101: just use write
 vegeta1101: write answer
 Codeab: what does the number in the string bracket do?
 vegeta1101: length of string you want as input
 vegeta1101: you can set it accourding to your requirement
 Codeab: so the number can be like 2384238949283 but it wont affect what the user inputs?
 vegeta1101: yep
 Codeab: ohhhhh thz
 vegeta1101: welcome
 Codeab: um guys can someone tell me why my page keeps reloading and restarting over in the contribution page
 Codeab: it keeps saying 'Aw snap'
 Codeab: 'something went wrong'
 vegeta1101: yaa that page have bugs
 vegeta1101: try  not copy paste
 Codeab: oh no wonder
 Codeab: wait i didnt copy paste anything and the page still crashed
 vegeta1101: hmm contact coding game my site also kept crashing and i gave up on making puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: use the SDK, then you can upload your testcases in a zip file
 Xwtek: occse;sei
 Codeab: um whats a SDK
 KiViN: hello:wave:

 caozouhulue: U?
 AVANTISAVOIA: yes whats the problem CLi
 Cli592: ASCII Art
 AVANTISAVOIA: im just having fun caozou
 AVANTISAVOIA: what do u need to know
 Cli592: i dont understand
 caozouhulue: maybe this problem is 
 caozouhulue: print all the way

 Noisewerk: Is it just me or CG has a tough time loading today?
 caozouhulue: hey bro, what is CG
 Noisewerk: Coding Game lol
 Noisewerk: Btw welcome, guess you new
 Uljahn: they're updating database, Noisewerk
 Noisewerk: I see, thanks
 caozouhulue: today the server is not work well
 Astrolocus: yes in fact for today I will use Kattis
 thanhhv317: my internet is not good in today
 Codewena: Oh I guess I'm not the only one having trouble with the connection
 jacek: codingame is so slow today
 jacek: maybe they should make more optimization puzzles
 wlesavo: due to update probably
 marcal279: hey i'm a sy uni student. wanted to ask which languages i should know to be ready for placements, etc. as of now i know c, c++, python and a little java. confused which language i should learn next
 Westicles: Just forget the java and the rest should be fine
 Kirneh: hehe Java is still used a lot&#160;:)
 Kirneh: Trying out the .NET framework might not be a waste of time
 marcal279: okayyythanks a lot!!! :grinning:
 marcal279: do i need to know sql/javascript/r?
 Westicles: What kind of job do you want?
 Lakkeger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1523abc3-3d8b-4d43-af55-153f2a0f503d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1523abc3-3d8b-4d43-af55-153f2a0f503d</a>
 Lakkeger: hm that's a bit odd...
 Lakkeger: no multiline answers as i can tell
 Lakkeger: @marcal279 it depends what do you want to do in the future. as frontend web developer you might go with:javascript, css, html, nodejs, different javascript libs like angular...etc. backend wise: java, go, php, python, sql...etc. application dev wise (depends on the platform you want to develope the app): c, c++, c#, java. the list can go on and on. decide first what do you want to do
 Westicles: And if you want to slip into depression and eventually kill yourself, get a job writing clojure
 grateful_tomato: why does it say "join a 5min coding battle"? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/J53P8ve.png">https://i.imgur.com/J53P8ve.png</a> it is 15 minutes
 grateful_tomato: also site freezes sometimes and really slow, only reload helps
 sahilrox: The only way I can join a clash is by waiting for the clash to start, leaving the clash and then going one page back
 sahilrox: Also I can only view results if i refresh the page

 alprasss: Power of Thor - Episode 1
 AndreMarasca: what is the problem?
 alprasss: i dont know how to solved
 AndreMarasca: each shift you must perform an action
 AndreMarasca: Each turn*
 matez: Something seems to be wrong with the server speed / accessibility...
 AndreMarasca: when you move, you must update the position of the thor in its variables
 AndreMarasca: prefer to walk in NW, NE, SW and SE directions
 AndreMarasca: These directions save energy
 AndreMarasca: a hypotenuse is shorter than two sides
 AndreMarasca: Just it

 rohitkumar212: hi
 TheDell013: hi
 rohitkumar212: is there a problem with the website?
 rohitkumar212: unable to join the clash
 abmyii: I had the same issue
 abmyii: I had to restart the page to be redirected to the clash
 rohitkumar212: oh
 rohitkumar212: ok i joined now, but no one is joining..
 rohitkumar212: i m the only one here
 abmyii: No, go back to the last link
 abmyii: i.e. the "room" for joining the clash
 abmyii: And you should be redirected to the IDE
 rohitkumar212: see now i joined the clash, and the timer is running..
 rohitkumar212: let me see if i m able to join
 rohitkumar212: or start

 NgonTran: can you guys join the game
 NgonTran: can you guys join the game&#160;?
 anantaCodes: Does CodinGame maintain a users activity history on their end? Something that would give an indication as to how much time the user spends on this site&#160;?
 player_one: You can see in your profile some achievements around how many times you submit code.
 player_one: As an example.
 anantaCodes: Yea, I understand that. But I was trying to figure out if there is something like Github which remembers your commit history.
 Uljahn: they gather some statistics of forum usage
 anantaCodes: Like I am attempting a problem in Practice section but I need to test it many times . It would be wonderful if there was a way to know how many times I attempted problem before getting it 100% right
 player_one: Only for competitions... For anything under "COMPETE" they have a complete history of all your submissions.
 anantaCodes: @Uljahn Where is the forum?
 Uljahn: :scream_cat:
 player_one: Click down arrow in top-right corner.
 player_one: Forum is under that menu
 Allis: It's in the three-dot menu, not the arrow.
 anantaCodes: LOL... They got a forum too. After 2 months I know this
 anantaCodes: :D
 player_one: Ooops... Thanks Allis
 anantaCodes: Ya I checked it now 🤯
 anantaCodes: Uljahn was very disappointed it seems&#160;;)

 rohitkumar212: Guys, any idea abt the captcha code?
 rohitkumar212: i often have to answer the captche before joining any clash
 rohitkumar212: this is quite time taking, irritating
 Illedan: Do you play a lot of clashes?
 rohitkumar212: ya
 rohitkumar212: kind of 30 games a day..
 rohitkumar212: at max
 Illedan: It is any bot measures, which happens after a lot of clashes 
 Illedan: *anti
 rohitkumar212: oh dude
 rohitkumar212: this is quite irritating
 rohitkumar212: they could do away even without this..
 rohitkumar212: i quite often miss to catch up with my friends who had invited me into the play
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/captchas/2594">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/captchas/2594</a>
 rohitkumar212: due to this delay , as i spend time in answering the captcha
 rohitkumar212: yeah i have seen some faq's related to this
 eulerscheZahl: so: deal with it or do something about your clashing addiction
 eulerscheZahl: or would a 2nd account work as well? :thinking:
 Illedan: Hi euler, how much vacation are you taking for the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: 7 days. add 2 weekend and i'm free all the time
 Illedan: Nice&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: except for the first evening. will probably do kotlin heroes
 Illedan: aha
 Illedan: I'll stream the first evening
 Illedan: After that big group of streamers
 eulerscheZahl: have fun with your stream
 Illedan: Hopefully not crash and burn :P 
 eulerscheZahl: did that happen before?
 Illedan: BotG stream was a trainwreck xD
 eulerscheZahl: watched the first few minutes, don't remember any details except from squiddy being connected as well
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm pretty sure it was a C# stream :P
 Illedan: Sure was C#
 eulerscheZahl: what went wrong? bug in the code you couldn't find? or CG servers slow?
 Illedan: Everything :D We pushed a new engine to fix the bug with stunned heroes not using their command
 Illedan: and it crashed everything
 Illedan: after 5 min into the stream
 eulerscheZahl: then i left just in time it seems :D
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: as soon as i stopped taking the contest seriously it was quite fun to see new engine bugs every day
 eulerscheZahl: game complexity was strong with that contest
 Illedan: A little too much :P
 eulerscheZahl: and now you announced to stream a game that you don't even know yet
 eulerscheZahl: buying the cat in the box
 Illedan: Hope it is something fun&#160;:)
 Illedan: And complex
 Illedan: physics would be amazing
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://airtable.com/shrLIOcKJPVoTRdeY/tblDCOBztDlD4XmCg/viw4Lj9y4fmXbO7i8?date=2020-11-12&amp;mode=month">https://airtable.com/shrLIOcKJPVoTRdeY/tblDCOBztDlD4XmCg/viw4Lj9y4fmXbO7i8?date=2020-11-12&amp;mode=month</a>
 kovi: i vote for non physics
 eulerscheZahl: hidden below "show 2 more"
 Illedan: Click on the day view top right :P
 eulerscheZahl: i vote for no fog
 Illedan: ^^^^^
 Illedan: Anything but fog yeah
 kovi: yeah, two was enough for this year
 Illedan: haha
 eulerscheZahl: if i would watch all those streams i wouldnt have time to code myself
 Illedan: True
 eulerscheZahl: nice, i'm a useful resource
 Illedan: I have to prepare from the start of the contest for my own stream :P 
 kovi: i got stuck with d&amp;b. the more intelligent it is, the worse it became
 Illedan: I'm playing around with Blocking these days
 eulerscheZahl: i did topcoder, wont do anything new bofore the contest
 Illedan: I'm moving to NS this weekend though
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 kovi: i failed with topcoder so needed some egoboost here
 eulerscheZahl: you got the right idea
 eulerscheZahl: simulated annealing is surprisingly popular on TC
 eulerscheZahl: i thought the markov chain was obvious for everyone
 kovi: imho, that was a nice fresh idea
 eulerscheZahl: saw it in context of monopoly cell distributions
 player_one: Hey eulershceZahl, I played around with CGFunge Prime yesterday. Fun challenge.
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, inspired by your puzzle
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: imho?
 Astrobytes: in my humble opinion
 Astrobytes: (also honest opinion)
 MattSOrme: how on earth have people done don't panic in under 100 chars?I've tried everything I could think of and im only down to 230
 ParticleBeam: What language?
 MattSOrme: python
 Star_Child: ...
 Star_Child: hi
 Uljahn: im at 177 in py3, but the code looks more like perl :smile:
 ParticleBeam: Removed all "imports"
 Uljahn: ofc, you need no imports in this puzzle
 Uljahn: also redefined most common functions like i=input and r=int
 wlesavo: and maping inputs also helps
 wlesavo: but yeah, it is not nearly enough for 100 chars 
 MattSOrme: already assigned int, and i had assigned input, but just updated that to a lambda which has dropped me to 222
 ParticleBeam: obviously remove all spaces, put common lines together with&#160;; symbol
 ParticleBeam: and variables renambe to 1 letter
 MattSOrme: yep, done those too&#160;:/ 
 MattSOrme: there has to be some magic thing people have used i don't know about 
 Uljahn: why lambda?
 MattSOrme: cos it lets me input().split() 3 times with less characters
 eulerscheZahl: "r=int"thanks, i missed that&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i have the lambda too, quite verboses=lambda _:input().split()
 Uljahn: i,r=input,int
 Uljahn: that's what wlesavo've ment i guess
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i read the input more often
 MattSOrme: you dont need the _ in your lambda
 MattSOrme: L=lambda:input().split()
 eulerscheZahl: nice, that also removes my dummy argument when calling it :D
 eulerscheZahl: 188 =&gt; 181, thanks to both of you
 MattSOrme: Im down to 216&#160;:( 
 MattSOrme: Need 200 for this damn quest
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the toad has an idea for you in return
 eulerscheZahl: my LEFT / RIGHT check:d&gt;'M'
 ParticleBeam: Let me double check 
 ParticleBeam: Ah yes. replace "range"
 ParticleBeam: While loop, replace True with 1?
 MattSOrme: Done the true-&gt;1. Not sure what you mean by the &gt;'M'and i don't use range currently
 eulerscheZahl: you have a LEFT or RIGHT in the input
 eulerscheZahl: how do you check if it's one or the other?
 eulerscheZahl: direction[0] == 'L'?direction == 'LEFT'?
 eulerscheZahl: for me: direction &lt; 'M'
 wlesavo: nice
 wlesavo: btw euler i got perfect predictions for cg sponsored
 eulerscheZahl: great
 eulerscheZahl: do you know if testcases and validators are the same?
 ParticleBeam: Bah. Can't go below 185
 MattSOrme: i base it on the length of the string of the direction
 wlesavo: pretty much the same, in terms of maps and enemy types
 wlesavo: so can be hardcoded
 eulerscheZahl: also starting locations?
 wlesavo: didnt check that
 wlesavo: my solution is online but types and maps are hardcoded
 wlesavo: and i have a quite poor mc search for now
 eulerscheZahl: i have a depth 1 i think
 eulerscheZahl: too long ago
 wlesavo: i have smth like depth 70 estimation, but i not even keep the best found solution yet, probably with smth like beamsearch it can be done quite a buit better
 MattSOrme: Down to 212
 MattSOrme: oof, 207
 MattSOrme: changed an "a if x else b" to [b,a][x]
 ParticleBeam: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see how to use that in combination with my optimized check
 eulerscheZahl: as i don't get 0/1 but a much wider range
 ParticleBeam: Replace "and" with &amp;
 eulerscheZahl: i have ^
 MattSOrme: ooh, that'd get me 4
 eulerscheZahl: good old xor
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i have a use for the &amp; too. I had a multiplication there, giving a larger range
 eulerscheZahl: l=list(map(...))is there a better way?
 eulerscheZahl: something with a *map or alike?
 RoboStac: oh nice, got down to 167 with some of the tips here
 MattSOrme: hmm, &amp; causes mine to fail
 ParticleBeam: Could try *
 AntiSquid: what are we code golfing
 MattSOrme: dont panic
 eulerscheZahl: SyntaxError: can't use starred expression here&#160;:/
 ParticleBeam: I converted my logic to an equation so - and *
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38702484">https://stackoverflow.com/a/38702484</a>that one helped me
 ParticleBeam: That helped me drop 1 character
 NitMpez: well got to 183 with everyone's commets from 186... but I'm doing javascript and bash... unfortunately bash is stuck at like 233
 eulerscheZahl: my bash is always my python + 12:python3 -c"..."
 NitMpez: ahh... yeah was avoiding doing that... not sure how to get it much under 233 with just straight bash
 eulerscheZahl: because you aren't good enough with bash
 NitMpez: :P tx
 eulerscheZahl: neither am i. or golfing in general
 NitMpez: same... 
 NitMpez: ended up writing both and then looking up some stuff to shorten the code
 NitMpez: problem i have on my bash... vs the java script... is all my variables have to have $ in from of them
 NitMpez: extra character per variable use
 ParticleBeam: Phew. Got it to 174
 MattSOrme: nice, im still stuck
 eulerscheZahl: 175
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps ParticleBeam around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/4780977304016" /> NitMpez: 179 now&#160;:|
 ParticleBeam: Time to code more on Penguins
 eulerscheZahl: looks fun
 eulerscheZahl: the pushing reminds me of wondev woman
 MattSOrme: just can't compress this damn while loop. pretty much re-written how i choose wait/block and it came out at 207 same as it was before&#160;:(
 jacek: meow
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday's eve jace
 eulerscheZahl: k
 eulerscheZahl: oh, he's off. tab completion isn't working
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, i tab complete jace to jacek
 NitMpez: we 166
 eulerscheZahl: now you tooJudas
 NitMpez:&#160;:|
 MattSOrme: 204 changing list(iterable)  -&gt; [*iterable]
 eulerscheZahl: *iterable,
 eulerscheZahl: 203
 MattSOrme: i'll be damned. 30
 MattSOrme: 203*
 eulerscheZahl: so it's proven. 200 isn't possible
 ParticleBeam: Do you still read all the variables?
 NitMpez: 158
 eulerscheZahl: calm down
 NitMpez: sorry, all the talk on it made me look at it again
 NitMpez: truth be told i don't care for code golf that much
 ParticleBeam: I do wonder how people can get such short code lengths
 NitMpez: yeah... i don't understand the ones below 100
 MattSOrme: i do read all vars, and ignore some, but not sure how to shrink further
 NitMpez: I'm assuming they are just doing something like what was mentioned in a discussion i saw... put your code online then just do like an sh `curl(&lt;site&gt;)`
 ParticleBeam: Read with one variable and index it
 eulerscheZahl: that curl got fixed
 eulerscheZahl: worked at Power of Thor. the best solution had 9 chars
 eulerscheZahl: included buying a really short domain
 NitMpez: fun
 NitMpez: well then I'm baffled at the 57 character solutions
 eulerscheZahl: no idea how it works
 eulerscheZahl: mine would break at &gt; 9 floors. bu apart from that it's a generic solution
 NitMpez: yeah no idea be curious to see how they did it
 darkhorse64: 88 hard coded py3 but still from the lead
 darkhorse64: *still far*
 RaresJavaCPhytonPascal: hi
 eulerscheZahl: how do you even hardcode that?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a way to get the hardcoded one shorter than a real solution
 NitMpez: a="BLOCK",b="WAIT",a,b,b,b,b,b,a,b,a,b,b,b,b,a,b,a
 NitMpez: :P
 wlesavo: wow nice darkhorse64
 NitMpez: yeah no idea... im not that motivated to do that
 eulerscheZahl: just wait until CG changes the validators
 darkhorse64: with a table indexed by the #of floors (the last digit). 
 eulerscheZahl: they did that for thor
 wlesavo: and im asserting sleep times for cg sponsored :smiley:
 wlesavo: im a little bit of a hardcoder myself
 darkhorse64: If validators change, it will be like a new challenge
 NitMpez: not for me.. ill be done with the same answer :P
 ParticleBeam: I am of the opinion that validators in general should be run a few time and tallied. Sometimes, random based solutions (Tree searches etc) could give great solutions one time and not so great the next. I saw that with Mars Lander.

 Astrobytes: jacek, all aboard the hype train ...
 eulerscheZahl: you won't find that on leetcode
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-dominoes-path/187368">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-dominoes-path/187368</a>creating puzzle threads manually now?
 eulerscheZahl: but thumbs up for adding one to all the puzzles now
 Astrobytes: Seems the automation didn't work for them all
 Astrobytes: but yeah, agreed
 jacek: AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: why do you want to be careful?
 rusty: Just ran into this in a puzzle on clash of code, was wondering if anyone knows why the following happens?
 rusty: also seems to be 12 in PHP and Java as well
 jacek: it is 0
 jacek: try dividing by 19 and it will be full number
 jacek: why 12? i dont know
 jacek: number is 57bit long so it isnt long overflow
 rusty: yup, I know the correct mathematical answer, but when you run the code in node js it's 12, wondering why
 jacek: well i got this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/UUtlJ5m.png">https://i.imgur.com/UUtlJ5m.png</a>
 jacek: could it be it changes to double on the fly?
 jacek: in python int(float(111111111111111111))&#160;% 19 it is 12
 jacek: :o
 Zenoscave: numbers in JS are defaulted to float
 Zenoscave: which loses precision after a bit on large numbers
 jacek: oh Zenoscave did you register on LG?
 Zenoscave: LG?
 Astrobytes: Little Golem
 Zenoscave: little golem
 Zenoscave: yes
 jacek: i see
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, the epic profile pic lol
 jacek: its the default. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=140575">https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=140575</a>
 Astrobytes: ah right
 Astrobytes: your bot seems to perform well jacek
 Zenoscave: jacek do you play manually on there?
 jacek: longer time control
 Astrobytes: Only Breakthrough or do you do others too?
 jacek: only bt. and its bot
 Zenoscave: I'm unsure if some players are bots
 Zenoscave: darn
 jacek: they should have _bot in the name
 Zenoscave: just lokoed closer... It does&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: jacek is it the same bot as on CG?
 jacek: it has larger NN and it takes few seconds to move
 Zenoscave: Ah.
 Zenoscave: also Double precision variance is the problem for that large of a number
 Zenoscave: 111111111111111111 =&gt; 111111111111111104.000000 (4378ABEF7846071C)&#160;: +1.541976 * 2 ^ 56
 Zenoscave: No that's every language Jacek. any number greater than 2 ^ 52 must be an integer in double format. 
 Zenoscave: 2^53 ==&gt; multiple of 2.2^54 ==&gt; multiple of 4.2^x ==&gt; multiple of 2^(x-52)
 Zenoscave: (64 bit doubles only store 52 bits of value. 11 bits of shifting exponent and 1 bit for sign)
 jacek: other languages have 64bit ints :v
 Zenoscave: this is the same in js and other languages. there might be long doubles (128-bits) in some processor extensions
 MACKEYTH: Is there a way to switch the IDE from K&amp;R style indentation to Allman?
 froyd: lets bora
 froyd: where is the ruby coders?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Ewwww ruby
 EightByteRG: Quick question, does anyone know if there is a place where you can access all the available variables for coders strike back?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Look at the statement at the bottom
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: It gives all the inputs
 Codeab: hi guys for contribution what does it mean that the code "is working for all languages"
 Codeab: when i click ready
 LastRick: You are doing an approval?
 Codeab: im making a puzzle
 Codeab: ok wait i found out nvrm
 LastRick: ok
 numb3r5: hello world
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Is it possible to access a local file from my computer?
 amr-raazi: no
 gabrielsoft: Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 gabrielsoft: little help here
 LastRick: whats the question?
 gabrielsoft: Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output
 LastRick: yes
 amr-raazi: append 0, sort list, find index of 0. get 2 elements sorrounding index. get absolute diff between those elements. whichever is smaller, display
 gabrielsoft: i dont think am getting it right
 LastRick: well, it will definitely tell you if you've got the wrong answer
 gabrielsoft: i see no index here @amr-razzi
 amr-raazi: dude. do u want me to code it for you? 
 gabrielsoft: more like a range not a length of anything
 LastRick: what language are you coding in?
 gabrielsoft: sure
 gabrielsoft: js

 gabrielsoft: Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.Constraints0 ≤ N &lt; 10000
 gabrielsoft: ok. 
 gabrielsoft: guys help out here
 amr-raazi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/nNRLpBp7">https://pastebin.com/nNRLpBp7</a>
 amr-raazi: try this maybe
 gabrielsoft:   i see no lisst here
 gabrielsoft: more like a looping thing

 gabrielsoft: nothing worked
 amr-raazi: try my python solution once?

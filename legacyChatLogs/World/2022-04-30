 Phantomghoul: how do you debug?
 eulerscheZahl: with an offline IDE
 Phantomghoul: in clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: stderr
 Phantomghoul: with java....
 eulerscheZahl: System.err.println()
 NinjaDoggy: eulerscheZahl what's plan for this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure
 NinjaDoggy: is it fun?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm working on something but motivation isn't too hugh
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like the heuristic nature of the game
 NinjaDoggy: rip... DUCT not good here?
 eulerscheZahl: don't know, never used that particular algo
 jacek: no smitsimax either?
 jacek: well me too ~
 NinjaDoggy: I'm thinking about a smitsi, duct combo
 NinjaDoggy: but lacking motivation hard&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: still haven't even finished sim lmao
 jacek: :upside_down:
 ClockSort: NinjaDoggy I've been trying DUCT all week, it's not easy on this one
 ClockSort: I tried DUCT with all 6 agents selecting their moves separately... but since you share mana and wind stacks, you don't find the best moves
 ClockSort: also, MCTS doesn't do well when you need a specific sequence of moves to win (i.e. 5 specific moves in a row to protect base)
 ClockSort: rollouts don't find long sequences very well.
 ClockSort: this contest is remarkably good for heuristics vs search... much better than 2021 Spring
 eulerscheZahl: is that a good thing?
 jacek: hm? people were doing good in 2021
 jacek: with heuristic as well
 eulerscheZahl: my search is somewhat working now (attacker only, defense still heuristic)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628985966">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628985966</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i still don' track units in fog, which makes it harder to search (i forget my future plans and can't find them anymore)
 eulerscheZahl: and it's slow<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628986910">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628986910</a>
 Quidome: finally gold, with a defense only bot&#160;:)
 Quidome: pfff
 NinjaDoggy: ClockSort Hm... makes sense. For the first point that's why i'm thinkikng of combining Smitsimax with DUCT :P,  but for the second one, won't it just avoid states where it's necessary to find the exact sequence?
 NinjaDoggy: or does FOG ruin that part
 BenjaminUrquhart: I forgot I had cg sync until now
 VizGhar: hmm 1st in gold
 eulerscheZahl: but not legend yet?
 eulerscheZahl: you will make it, ranking fluctuation is high enough
 Noyotens: why my IDE not show me errors
 VizGhar: maybe... but my bot is still missing some key parts
 VizGhar: (dont even watch replays, you will get upset :D)
 VizGhar: I'm master mana earner and using that wind train (all heuristic) but not doing that "preparation" move...
 BenjaminUrquhart: with 2 days left, finally got around to some form of attacking <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629018888">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629018888</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: hopefully good enough for now
 BenjaminUrquhart: submits being a pain as usual so I won't get to see where it landed for the next 3 hours
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh hey found a bug lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: fixed
 FlyingPencilCaseAndHisDog_50cc: finally I got the right answer&#160;:)
 FlyingPencilCaseAndHisDog_50cc: :joy:
 hiamkaito: BenjaminUrquhart how to display status like your
 jacek: share replay
 jacek: add " message" to your output
 hiamkaito: how to do it bro, i use C#
 hiamkaito: oh thanks jacek, i made it :blush:

 kovi: interesting rockpaperscissors effect on leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: as always when the heuristic is too strong
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me a bit of BotG
 ItsNotABug: lol, your bot really decided not to take the easy win there, and kill the spider in their base with no defenders
 burnpanck: am still paralized - I just found that my re-write of the last few days is rejected due to too long compile-times; it's just ~3.5s on my machine!
 jacek: kotlin?
 eulerscheZahl: C++
 eulerscheZahl: massive use of templates?
 eulerscheZahl: how do you slow down a g++? :thinking:
 therealbeef: with templates it's not that hard, but template meta programming doesn't seem so suitable for this kind of game
 burnpanck: it's templates
 eulerscheZahl: hah!
 Westicles: maybe clang++ is faster?
 jordonez: is it better 1ms turn than a 49 ms one? or is it the same meanwhile you are under 50?
 eulerscheZahl: i want to submit my new bot but i'm scared that my current rank is better than it should be and i can't climb anymore
 burnpanck: I programmed an NN-driven MCTS search, where there are 6 different "towers" to drive the search. That kind of thing is best done with templates.
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't matter jordonez
 burnpanck: It's not the runtime, it is the duration of the compilation - the Arena just kills the compiler.
 jordonez: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: exceed the 50ms in a single turn and you are out
 jordonez: ok
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds really complex burnpanck. if you somehow get it working to play well, i'm heavily impressed
 eulerscheZahl: and inoryy will give you a reference if you want to apply at DeepMind
 jacek: not intersted unless they work on bioengineering certain creatures
 eulerscheZahl: reminder: codejam round 1C is starting in less than 1 hour
 burnpanck: thanks for the reminder! after my fiasco here, I'm much more inclined to compete there&#160;:-)
 jacek: its CG fiasco they cant compile your code ~
 Scarfield:  ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 Westicles: would templates compile faster with -std=c++20 flag?
 burnpanck: maybe not the templates themselves, but there would be less template instantiations needed mainly due to Concepts
 Westicles: well, you could try it
 burnpanck: I can't set flags in the Arena, there is no #pragma for that
 Westicles: run it from bash
 burnpanck: but what's the point, I have no trouble compiling my bot locally. I want to let compete in the arena, and for that I have simply no path here.
 Westicles: you can run bash in the arena
 burnpanck: now that is an interesting thought 
 jacek: is this possible for contests?
 eulerscheZahl: technically possible: sure. but might get you disqualified
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/20949c31-e9c6-4ffa-ae74-e5eab71fbf78">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/20949c31-e9c6-4ffa-ae74-e5eab71fbf78</a>
 burnpanck: it's probably cheating on the "language choice" aspect
 eulerscheZahl: anything that looks like obfuscation will get you disqualfied. i don't know where exactly they draw the line
 burnpanck: I guess the other problem with that approach is that then, I would have to get the compilation time down to the 1s of the first move time limit.
 eulerscheZahl: rule was introduced because of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary">https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary</a>
 eulerscheZahl: compressing your NN weights is ok, as long as the rest of the code is readable
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/new-contests-rule/2895/9">https://forum.codingame.com/t/new-contests-rule/2895/9</a>
 burnpanck: yeah, anyway, I would have to re-write my code utilising the C++20 goodness, and thats too much work given the uncertainty if it will help AND be accepted.
 therealbeef: for my UTTC bot i started with heavy template use for state eval, but it took 2 mins to compile even locally. in the end i still kept some of it (moving some of the compile time calc to runtime calc) to stay in the 10s compile limit, and it does give speed benefits
 Nik05: morning
 putibuzu: @burnpanck could you elaborate what you mean with "towers" in your search? sounds interesting&#160;:) 
 burnpanck: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa2e8528-076f-4e6a-9e8a-7bd6ec623892">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa2e8528-076f-4e6a-9e8a-7bd6ec623892</a>
 burnpanck: each tower learns to characterise different aspects of the game: own heroes, mobs, pairing of the two, etc... 
 burnpanck: I.e. the input features to the hero tower are "distance to the base", "number of mobs in wind range",..., and the outputs are "move towards enemy base", "self-shield", ... 
 therealbeef: ah, like branches in the NN?
 burnpanck: the input features to the mob-hero pairing are "time needed to intercept", "is within control range", and the outputs "move toward that mob", "control that mob".
 jacek: do you use unicode encoding
 burnpanck: exactly, like branches in the NN; similar to the typical towers in deep learning, each of those branch stacks vertically in parallel layers - between each layers, there are weak bridges leaking information
 burnpanck: between the towers I mean; allowing the "hero" tower to take into account aggregated summaries over all pairings from the "mob-hero" tower. 
 _NikJ: 5th boss is random, any way to make it "replay in same conditions"?
 DomiKo: nope
 DomiKo: press that button many times
 jacek: hack into its rng
 _NikJ: Can't beat this mfker
 _NikJ: all out of ideas
 yhyoxx: try to copy a strategy from legends
 yhyoxx: look at the games from global leaderboard
 MindController: _NikJ i would reccomend trying to do 2 defenders 1 attacker
 MindController: it works like a charm against the boss
 _NikJ: I am, MindController
 MindController: Ur attacker
 MindController: Goes to attack very late
 MindController: Try with earlier attacking
 _NikJ: I use 200 for mana thres, after that I start attacking
 _NikJ: though whenever I tried to make it smaller, I'd end up ranking worse
 MindController: I would reccomend checking out my games
 MindController: My strat is insanely simple to code
 MindController: And working quite well
 MindController: I try to use minimal amount of spells
 MindController: 2 defend
 MindController: and 1 attacks very early
 eulerscheZahl: wow, your resubmit is top10 again. not a fluke
 MindController: Did a few changes
 eulerscheZahl: i completely rewired my attacker, 40 ranks lower
 MindController: Did like 3 changes
 MindController: If only using 1 change
 MindController: Im 30 ranks lower
 MindController: If combining them all
 MindController: Well
 MindController: This is the result
 yhyoxx: new strat, i win against boss, lose against my old bot..
 yhyoxx: mana issues
 Nerchio: rip eulerscheZahl&#160;:(
 TobiasA: damn I see a lot of people were hiding their bots
 yhyoxx: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

 Dapps: don't really see longer games at legend
 HoriMiyamura: 1d 21h 
 HoriMiyamura: Hope can be legend
 yhyoxx: me too&#160;;-;
 HoriMiyamura: I am around ~190 in gold
 HoriMiyamura: ...
 yhyoxx: i dont think im gonna make it by looking at the leaderboard the whole time it's calculating
 yhyoxx: pretty close 
 yhyoxx: i just got around 400
 TichHuyen: when I update it got lower score&#160;:*
 IvesL: i used my reverted old code 1week ago which cant even beat silver boss, reached top 1000 yesterday
 IvesL: i dont understand the calculation
 TichHuyen: I would say silver boss is strong
 TichHuyen: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 IvesL: i cant beat anyone in gold with that code, but my rank keep rising
 TichHuyen: haha
 IvesL: i have no idea
 yhyoxx: you're winning the latest battles tho&#160;?
 IvesL: i havent submitted since then
 IvesL: was around 1900-2200 globally, then yesterday suddenly popped a message, congrats to gold, then it keeps rising
 TichHuyen: I took a few days to improve my bot and it go from 200 to 800&#160;:(
 yhyoxx:&#160;:(
 TichHuyen: what is going on here........
 yhyoxx: it happens 
 yhyoxx: the goal is not to beat the boss
 jacek: and do the opposite
 jacek: [solved]
 yhyoxx: but beat more people in the league than the boss
 IvesL: that version is an experimenting bot, if you check out my games, 1 of them is likely to be idle at some point
 TichHuyen: sometimes I wind and the mod still there?
 TichHuyen: does anyone face the same issue?
 IvesL: got replay?
 IvesL: did you wind it to the edge?

 HoriMiyamura: yes, it is the edge
 IvesL: yes it will stuck
 IvesL: cant blow it out of map
 geppoz: hero y&lt;9000, wind y=9000 =&gt; you are pushing it towards wall
 geppoz: I suppose you should wind at same y of the hero at least
 Tuo: you are proply calculating the direction wrong, doing wind from hero perpective
 Tuo: using vector hero-&gt;destination
 HoriMiyamura: thanks, I see that
 skymount: /me
 HoriMiyamura: so it is a bug in my code :D
 jacek: Automaton2000 where is your hero
 Automaton2000: it's not like you can do it offline
 avdg: hmm now I'm back, still at 46th in silver (which is better than being around 700)
 HoriMiyamura: I just fix it
 avdg: need to implement more passive defends I guess

 mesu7: i am trying to solve rotating arrows problem 
 mesu7: but my code couldn't pass the 3rd test case
 mesu7: and i don't know why
 5DN1L: Do you mean the test case "Overflow" or "Validator 3"?
 mesu7: yes
 5DN1L: No, I'm asking you which one?
 mesu7: Overflow
 5DN1L: ok. What's your current code logic
 mesu7: can i paste my code here xd
 HoriMiyamura: yes
 HoriMiyamura: it will go to a basepin actually
 5DN1L: yes if you want to, though it may help if you can explain your code logic too haha
 HoriMiyamura: See photos and price history of this 3 bed, 2 bath, 1241 Sq. Ft. recently sold home located at 17630 Maple Ave, Country Club Hills, IL 60478 that was sold ...

 5DN1L: ok i can see your code now
 5DN1L: Hmmm your code passes Overflow
 5DN1L: your code doesn't pass Validator 3
 5DN1L: You can look up the name of the case you fail
 mesu7: from where
 5DN1L: by clicking RESULTS and then DETAILS
 5DN1L: on the left
 5DN1L: The error I see is:
 5DN1L: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0') at Answer.js. on line 24
 5DN1L: There's only one arrow in the whole grid in Validator 3

 Lumideus:  = 
 cegprakash: how to defend when 2 monsters are far away from base and enemy sneaks into my base
 cegprakash: my heroes often go out to defend so far ending my base unguarded
 cegprakash: this just costs sooo soo many games
 ItsNotABug: Set max distance from base for defenders, or keep a defender with distance of known enemy?
 ItsNotABug: 2 of many options
 Zyk0: Or attack better than opponent if you don't want to change your farming/def behaviour
 yhyoxx: maybe u should never be too far from base
 geppoz: question: if a monster has 1 health, and 3 heroes in range, they all get mana?
 ItsNotABug: yes
 blasterpoard: geppoz yes
 ItsNotABug: monsters give mana even if health goes sub zero
 geppoz: well so i think i have to rewrite all :D
 geppoz: if i see 2 monster and i have 2 heroes
 geppoz: better go with both on one monster, then on other monster
 geppoz: instead of split :D
 geppoz: in this way I would get double mana
 geppoz: I mean in first turns, when few monsters, in farm phase
 geppoz: (well not double mana, but some more)
 avdg: hmm 12 hours after submit, my bot went from 46 to 26 in about an hour
 ItsNotABug: yes and no. They will only get "double" on last hit, and only if health drops under 0.
 avdg: srr too excited for a bit
 ItsNotABug: Otherwise they will just kill spider quicker, and then be left not hitting anything
 geppoz: right
 therealbeef: 20 ppl above you might have promoted, avdg
 avdg: can be&#160;:-)
 avdg: also I won a few of the latest matches
 avdg: meanwhile I have to solve another math problem that I guess will help defense a bit
 avdg: my defense was good, but its proven to be done too costly now
 avdg: yesterday evening I solved a quite similar math problem at it helped my bot a lot it seems
 avdg: saved a bit of mana through less mispredictions
 ItsNotABug: To get high in gold you only need very basic defence. Hit stuff to get mana, and kick stuff out of base if its a risk of taking a life. Then focus more on attack imo
 avdg: my bot is doing that already, but it need higher precision
 avdg: or maybe top silver is a bit hard :p
 ItsNotABug: My bot to get into gold was stupid as :D Super basic defence with no state awareness. Then send a bot up to enemy and do some simple attack work
 yhyoxx: what kind of math problems are u solving&#160;?
 ItsNotABug: Working on re-writing the whole thing atm to think a bit more :D 
 avdg: geometry
 yhyoxx: im quite interested in intercepting spiders where they're heading
 yhyoxx: couldnt figure out a way yet
 jordonez: my bot is around gold 50th with just a huge amount of "if" but i don't know how to improve it to reach legend
 avdg: well you have to estimate where they are going
 yhyoxx: not that good with geometry 
 cegprakash: yhyoxx I use for loop for that
 cegprakash: coz I bad in math
 avdg: hmm I've solved that problem in the previous weekend
 blasterpoard: yhyoxx just calculate spider's position on future turns in a loop and check whether you can get there within that number of turns
 ItsNotABug: track unseen spiders, keep adding vx, vy each turn until you either should have seen it, or it should be off the map. Not a heap of geometry involved
 blasterpoard: don't bother with any geometry
 avdg: it could then already tracked invisible monsters too
 blasterpoard: just simple distance checks
 yhyoxx: nice 
 avdg: (and I'm still silver :D)
 yhyoxx: thanks 
 jordonez: how can you track unseen spiders!?
 avdg: memory
 avdg: and math
 jordonez: but if you dont have seen them, how do you know they even exist?
 Uljahn: symmetry
 yhyoxx: u cant then
 ItsNotABug: You have to have seen them once to know position and "un-affected" route. But other option is not to :D 
 yhyoxx: or that
 avdg: though my math wasn't perfect
 jordonez: ah ok
 avdg: I solved the problem part I couldn't solve with brute force math
 avdg: so it might do up to around 20 guesses, but they are relative rarely needed
 tugrul512bit: what problem?
 tugrul512bit: I like brute force
 tugrul512bit: link pls
 avdg: no
 avdg: it's geometry problems, and the loops mostly involve when a bot think it's possible when it isn't
 tugrul512bit: was performance problem with brute force?
 avdg: my bot does mostly all the work in a fraction of a ms
 avdg: and the bruteforce was I believe a multiply and compare
 avdg: which is basically almost the fast thing a cpu can do (besides adds and binary shifts/rotation/etc)
 avdg: well all that matters is the problesm you want to solve and see if you have enough data and resources to get there
 cegprakash: if only I had a bot as strong as I've now 2 days back I would have been chilling in legend league right now.. more the time more harder for climbing the ladder as everyone are getting stronger
 MindController: cegprakash but the boss is not getting stronger
 MindController: so isnt climbing to legend the same?
 cegprakash: it isn't
 avdg: meh, the bot behaves sometimes like a traffic jam
 avdg: it can block very smart bots that are not capable to beat the ai
 cegprakash: coz climbing the ladder against 10 different strategies is harder than just beating the boss
 cegprakash: MindController
 blasterpoard: it gets easier with time, because people are optimizing against boss and pushign its rating lower than it should be
 avdg: or sometimes good bots that are not high enough to fight the boss
 cegprakash: boss is now 30+
 cegprakash: he was in 28.5
 MindController: cegprakash boss was always 30+
 blasterpoard: the boss is #55 in legend, that tells you how many people already got to legend even though they don't really belong there
 cegprakash: ppl pushed the boss up
 MindController: they didnt
 cegprakash: meaning ppl don
 MindController: the day legend came out
 cegprakash: don't care about beating the boss much 
 MindController: boss was 29.5
 MindController: It is way easier to climb now
 MindController: Cause u only have to optimize against boss
 MindController: if u beat boss, u beat 90% of gold
 avdg: the ratings of both leagues are disconnected I guess
 avdg: the score only represents a relative number to everyone in the same group
 MindController: There is no way
 MindController: If u have &gt;60% wr against boss, that u cant get out of gold
 avdg: wr?
 MindController: winrate
 avdg: you still have to float on top of the other ai's
 avdg: but I can't say if gold is hard/easier than top silver
 MindController: cegprakash only win 1 out of 5 fights against the boss
 MindController: there is no wonder he cant get out of gold
 MindController: without winning consistently against boss
 avdg: hmm just checked my brute force again, it has a Math.sqrt in it :p
 avdg: they are still in even after I use a lot of alternative methods where possible
 avdg: I only use 5 sqrts but I have added some more math stuff so I can get rid of 1
 peerdb: @Eaglewind make sure to select Codam as your school also in the challenge please and thank you
 HoriMiyamura: control can only force 1 turn, is that correct?
 HoriMiyamura: this mean we only control the hero 1 move?
 geppoz: y
 HoriMiyamura: thanks
 geppoz: care that is the next one, not the current
 geppoz: means: he will do the move he output when you output your control, then your control is the move in the next turn
 HoriMiyamura: thanks
 HoriMiyamura: Hope I can move to legend with update on controll
 VizGhar: 0.01 from gold boss... I wont make my fixes before reaching legend
 barbora: :clap:
 Astrobytes: nice one VizGhar!
 VizGhar: I'm legend :D astro I won't buy my student the laptop :D
 VizGhar: tnx barbora
 Uljahn: :tada:
 Astrobytes: lol VizGhar! did he/she make it to legend or still in gold?
 VizGhar: still gold and he cant improve
 Astrobytes: ah, your wallet is safe :rofl:
 Astrobytes: still, well done to him for trying
 VizGhar: he's damn good/lucky haven't expected such performance from high schooler
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's awesome. A future talent I hope. Buy him a rubber duck for debugging purposes :D
 eulerscheZahl: did you have a bet: if student beats you, you buy him a laptop?
 hiamkaito: :joy:
 VizGhar: eulerscheZahl exactly
 HoriMiyamura: well, many hours to improve and then go down from 200 to 800
 eulerscheZahl: that's a risky bet
 jacek: eulerscheZahl so a student punches him and he gets a laptop? i wish i had a teacher like that
 HoriMiyamura: then I revert and do small improve and rank around 100 I think
 Astrobytes: jacek: :rofl:
 hiamkaito: me too, from 93 to 593 idk why :joy:
 VizGhar: except you would beat the teacher
 eulerscheZahl: Ram death should not suggest such things, some of his class are really good
 Astrobytes: + Konstant a 's class
 struct: grats vighar
 struct: viz*
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: from now on, legend in every contest&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: all 0 we are currently expecting?
 Astrobytes:&#160;:(
 VizGhar: you really think so euler?
 VizGhar: if so then yes... all 0 
 struct: hard to tell
 struct: But this time they didnt even add more servers
 struct: at least it feels like it
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what to expect. just couldn't resist the :salt:
 VizGhar: we really need this / or simillar web... is there any other such nice platform?
 Astrobytes: I added extra salt in your honour when cooking my noodles yesterday euler
 eulerscheZahl: blasphemia
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: ceg I think you are wrong, people keep submiting on gold and passing to legend easily
 VizGhar: my case ^^
 eulerscheZahl: there are some other websites but none that can really compete with CG
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder has nice optim contests. but the usability of the website is a mess
 struct: you also have bomberland
 struct: but docker
 struct: or w/e the game was called
 eulerscheZahl: but some real prizes at topcoder. like a trip to the USA instead of a canvas with artwork
 Astrobytes: yeah, CG were the cream of the crop when it comes to quality
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC: no idea about the future
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's a sad one
 eulerscheZahl: halite: dead
 eulerscheZahl: LuxAI: on kaggle, with few battles and limited languages i think
 Astrobytes: though they have bigger plans
 eulerscheZahl: their contests are always so long
 eulerscheZahl: riddles: died years ago
 eulerscheZahl: aigaming: no idea why i even mention it
 Astrobytes: theaigames disappeared too didn't it
 eulerscheZahl: riddles was done by theaigames staff
 Astrobytes: oh right
 Astrobytes: that explains that then
 struct: ok, time to remake my bot
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/blog/ai-game-competitions-list">https://www.gocoder.one/blog/ai-game-competitions-list</a>
 struct: 2 attackers or 1 to cheese gold?
 eulerscheZahl: 3
 struct:&#160;:/
 struct: it is indeed 2|1 is indeed 3
 struct: wtf
 struct: am i writing
 eulerscheZahl: indeed yes indeed
 struct: I just woke up sorry
 Astrobytes: indeed
 jacek: eeyup
 therealbeef: CG has gold in their hands. how can they not make good profit on this? if you see the amount of money companies spend on recruiting and events... and they don't even do advertisements yet.
 therealbeef: i don't get it
 [CG]Keelhaul: We do it from the pureness of our hearts
 Astrobytes: And it's very much appreciated. But you make it very hard on yourselves
 blasterpoard: this site should have a premium subscription for extra 20ms per turn, faster submits and skipping wood
 eulerscheZahl: hey Keelhaul, out of interest: are you an intern? i think i saw you as a regular user without [CG] years ago
 eulerscheZahl: skipping wood :D
 avdg: 10 free medals on sign up
 struct: Skipping wood this time was easy
 struct: the boss codes were public
 [CG]Keelhaul: I was recruited a couple months back&#160;:)
 IvesL: undercover
 struct:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, congratulations
 struct: are*
 Astrobytes: yeah congrats
 avdg: good luck with your career
 therealbeef: i'd pay for 'premium', even without competitive benefits&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i still remember you from the hypersonic contest, we finished close to each other in the end
 Astrobytes: even a 'donate what you can afford' would bring in money
 eulerscheZahl: if you accept something else than credit cards
 eulerscheZahl: German banking system is a nightmare when you want to transfer abroad
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c12f15e-b20c-4a14-a99e-8fdb8e371e97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c12f15e-b20c-4a14-a99e-8fdb8e371e97</a>
 [CG]Keelhaul: Thank you&#160;;)As for money, our main resource revenue is from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>Community won't became P2W^
 avdg: oh I chatted too long
 [CG]Keelhaul: Hypersonic was one of my few Lengend leaugue, that was a fun one :p
 Astrobytes: yeah we know about CG for Work
 IvesL: how does the work thing work
 eulerscheZahl: my first CG contest. came back years later to play it properly
 Astrobytes: IvesL: follow the link, it's explained
 eulerscheZahl: the work thing is recruiting tests
 eulerscheZahl: and internal team building events
 avdg: passing tests is 1 thing, having a stable company is another thing :p
 avdg: the company I worked for then was growing too fast
 avdg: so it became inflexible when the economy shifted drastically
 Astrobytes: the story of many a company
 avdg: meh it was a company where managers recruited people and basically put them on where was work
 avdg: just big scale
 avdg: salary and benefits were nice though there
 therealbeef: managers....
 avdg: yeah, managers only placed you and they expect you to deliver
 avdg: so basically the managers just collection tasks and distribute them
 avdg: the system breaks when the manager has to do some it stuff/decision at the customer
 VizGhar: Can't be CG platform (contests) sponsored by EU grants or something? It's AI everybody want AI experts
 Djellowman: any new rules in silver, gold or legend league? or same as bronze
 Uljahn: same
 avdg: ow I silently promoted to gold
 Djellowman: is it possible to miss WIND spells, because it is cast after the move phase?
 avdg: you can't move and cast at the same time
 avdg: but you can be moved
 Djellowman: just looking at a game, and my heroes double cast wind on a monster, but only 1 hits
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629311632">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629311632</a>
 struct: is this the best defense?
 Djellowman: no, but the monsters move
 struct: Look how my attacker defends the opponent at the end
 struct: This might turn into meta
 fcil: hii
 avdg: wind is step 6, monster move is step 7
 IvesL: i personally wont aim at 0,0
 Djellowman: lets say you cast WIND on a monster, but during the turn you cast it, they move out of range
 IvesL: to prevent such scenario
 Djellowman: oh you're right. i cant read
 struct: yeah ill aim based on angle soon
 Djellowman: turns out i didnt have mana for 1 of the casts
 IvesL: you miss the  my_mana -=10
 Djellowman: guess you have to keep track of how much mana you spend during a turn yeah
 avdg: yeah mana buffer is important
 avdg: my bot does keep track which moves are being played
 avdg: so it always knows (for at that point of time) how much mana is spend
 avdg: it doesn't flush moves out directly
 DustinNunyo: I am starting to suspect that this boss AI in mad pod racing just strait up has a faster ship than me...
 struct: :D
 jacek: oO
 IvesL: the ai paid premium
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I feel the same when I play my bot vs top 3
 Djellowman: what is the right way to debug? say i want to see a particular monsters' stats such as shield_life
 Djellowman: during the game. mouseover only shows limited info
 Astrobytes: print to stderr
 avdg: probably the best way to debug, for code you can control, is to split up properly
 avdg: the debug approuch depends on your situation
 avdg: here, probably stderr or chat comments
 Djellowman: but you would have to print out so much to stderr. in a debugger you can just see current variable values
 Djellowman: all the stats for all the entites on screen basically
 Astrobytes: if you have a working simulation, you can take all the information for a turn and run it offline
 Astrobytes: but you still have to print that info to stderr, or download a replay
 avdg: you can dump state if you are only interested in frames
 Djellowman: not sure what you mean
 Djellowman: wouldnt that be printing out every variable on every frame
 avdg: just stderr the stdin you get
 avdg: then you can reply without sim
 avdg: just reply on recording
 Counterbalance: i just print the bot input to stderr, copy-paste the starting input and turn input to a local file, and then run the bot in VS with debug commandline argument &lt; in.txt
 DustinNunyo: How might one go about viewing shared code on these mini games? or is that something that isn't allowed?
 Djellowman: yeah i'm still working entirely in the in-browser ide
 Astrobytes: well it doesn't have a debugger, so unless you do what was stated above you're stuck with stderr only
 jacek: sharing codes? :scream:
 Djellowman: alright, thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 Djellowman: damn boss 4 is a lot harder.. controlling my heroes out of the base when monsters are nearing it
 cegprakash: that moment when u finally enter top 10 then u lose 10 games in a row
 cegprakash: my legend dream keeps vanishing
 Djellowman: are double wind casts on monster that will damage the base next turn a waste? is it better to just use 1 cast at a time
 avdg: the sum of all wind vectors is taken in that case
 Djellowman: yes
 avdg: that's why you have goally ai
 Djellowman: but i'm asking if you should even double cast wind for defense
 avdg: it depends
 avdg: monster also change target once outside the radius
 Djellowman: i get the feeling its better to save the mana and cast it again later if they get close again
 avdg: hoh, now I'm in gold, I'm questioning myself how this game would be if they introduced boosters
 Zaphus: Hmm, I've only lost 5 out of 30 games from this run - and in 5 of those I was playing as red...  going to have to check my code for hardcoded stuff  :slight_smile:
 avdg: (so with boosters, the heroes are temporary faster for a few turns)
 Djellowman: my heroes randomly dont use wind when they should wtff
 avdg: too big decision trees I guess
 FrancoisB: Never gonna let you down Zaphus
 IvesL: @avdg i suggest implementing levelling system, heroes that have killed enough monsters could level up to unlock different spells, or improve attributes
 FrancoisB: is it me or it's taking ages to submit, I don't recall it being so slow in the last few years
 cegprakash: need more fan and dust cleanup in the servers
 cegprakash: Blasterpoard MindController can I get a replay with 1 of u guys?
 cegprakash: I'll watch it till my submit ends :P
 cegprakash: me vs u guys
 Astrobytes: look it up on the leaderboard ceg
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629401681">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629401681</a>
 cegprakash: ^^ dammmn
 Astrobytes: oh, you're still gold, my bad
 cegprakash: thxx
 cegprakash: this submit most likely take me legend
 cegprakash: I fixed an if statement in my attacker
 Astrobytes: good luck&#160;:)
 Djellowman: okay i just realized we have to print commands in order of heroes 0, 1, 2....
 Djellowman: i sorted them :cold_sweat:
 cegprakash: I only sort enemy heroes never my heroes :P 
 cegprakash: I never had the need for it.. I dedicate my 0th index hero for attacker, 1 and 2 index for defence 
 Djellowman: can entities be pushed by wind &amp; controlled on the same turn?
 avdg: they are normally separate steps I guess
 cegprakash: say u print control on turn X Djellowman, the immediate turn monster just stops moving.. only the next turn it moves to the destination you give it.
 cegprakash: when it stops moving wind still works.
 cegprakash: but when it's moving to the destination you give it overrides the wind
 _NikJ: ah cegprakash, soo close bro :D
 cegprakash: I mean if u wind a controlled unit on immedate turn it works, on the control movement wind won't work 
 Djellowman: so if i cast control, the monster wouldn't move that turn..? i think it still moves. but it will move in the controlled direction next turn. shouldnt that stack with a wind cast the next turn?
 cegprakash: oh wait.. 
 cegprakash: yes it should stack
 cegprakash: what am I speaking
 cegprakash: and yes it still moves
 cegprakash: wind is an AOE spell and not a targetted spell
 cegprakash: targetted spell gets overridden by control
 cegprakash: for example a shield on a control
 cegprakash: or a move on a control
 cegprakash: move action is also kind of targetted action so it gets overridden
 Djellowman: huh
 Djellowman: you can't cast shield on controlled targets?
 Djellowman: i think you can. just if shield &amp; control get cast the same turn, the shield cast will do nothing i think
 Djellowman: could be wrong, but thats how i interpret the docs
 Djellowman: or it could be that the control still gets executed next turn, and the shield will also still be applied next turn
 cegprakash: CONTROL - Override the target's next action with a step towards the given coordinates.
 cegprakash: meaning if it's a move or a shield whatever is the action it'll override and CONTROL will take place
 cegprakash: even in order of priority CONTROL gets the first prio Djellowman
 44AA44: Why do people not like the bots in clash of code
 cegprakash: what do u mean by bots
 cegprakash: 44AA44
 DollarAkshay: There is no way to make the win push less than 2200 units right&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: wind*
 struct: only if you push against a wall
 Djellowman: cegprakash yet, but being blown away or shielded by another entity is not an action of the target entity
 Djellowman: yes*
 Djellowman: it overrides the entity's  own actions
 HoriMiyamura: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629436663">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629436663</a>
 Djellowman: ...i imagine
 HoriMiyamura: why hero is pushed but monster isn't&#160;? turn 75/76
 HoriMiyamura: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629436663">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629436663</a>
 HoriMiyamura: does anyone know why?
 Djellowman: why is a game against yourself not completely symmetrical until the end?
 VizGhar: LOL HoriMiyamura :D looks like bug
 HoriMiyamura: Djellowman, one is on ide, one is arena, they aren't the same
 blasterpoard: heroes move before winds happen, no bug there
 VizGhar: aha right
 HoriMiyamura: yeah
 HoriMiyamura: I just see that
 Djellowman: HoriMiyamura i'm not sure what you mean. if you play against yourself it should be a symmetrical game
 HoriMiyamura: no the one in my ide is editable
 HoriMiyamura: you never done that before?
 Djellowman: regarding the game; yeah the hero moves into range before wind gets cast, and then the monster moves into range
 Djellowman: yes it is editable in the sense that you can select an opponent. if the oppont is yourself, the game should always be drawn, no?
 HoriMiyamura: no, there are 2 case that can cause the game not symetric
 HoriMiyamura: 1./ The one on IDE is different code from the one on Arena, which is my case
 HoriMiyamura: 2./ when the algorithm isn't deterministic
 Djellowman: so they are not the same bots then
 HoriMiyamura: yup
 Djellowman: i don't see a reason to introduce nondeterminism in these bots
 HoriMiyamura: case 2 is same bot, but they run random algorithm
 Djellowman: since they started out mirrored, i was surprised that the result wasn't a draw
 Djellowman: ah i see, so you did make them nondeterministic
 HoriMiyamura: At lot of bot Algo are nonditerministic, although we tend to use a seed to make it deterministic
 HoriMiyamura: but it may depend on how you code your solution.
 TichHuyen: the replay is about case 1: 2 bots with different source code
 DollarAkshay: If I send a 0 HP monster into the enemy base does that do damage&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: sent by wind
 blasterpoard: no
 TichHuyen: Can we do that?
 ClockSort: blasterpoard are you using a search alg or just heuristics?
 ClockSort: it's crazy how well your approach works :D
 blasterpoard: you would probably call it depth 1 search with a sort of cheat-like evaluation that substitutes deeper simulation
 blasterpoard: but that's just heuristics, isn't it?
 _NikJ: so basically, dark magic?
 TichHuyen: Do we have anygroup discuss about the strategy for this game on discord?
 blasterpoard: after the contest, there will be postmortems on the forum
 GlaceCoding: :eyes:
 TichHuyen: I know, just want to know if currently we have one
 TichHuyen: I am struggling to legend
 cegprakash: _NikJ yea dark magic
 Astrobytes: there is one on the CG discord yes, and a bug report thread in the forum, plus the webchat here
 struct: Currently there is a thread to report bugs but thats about it

 Scarfield: during contests there will be some level of strategy talk, but the potential winning players wont at shouldnt give away the gold nuggets until after contest is over
 Astrobytes: np struct
 Scarfield: also oi
 struct: hi and bye
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: hiya Scarfield
 Scarfield: :wave:
 struct: I see you got in legend
 TichHuyen: well, I am stuck ...
 struct: nice
 Scarfield: who astro?
 struct: TichHuyen which league are you in?
 Astrobytes: I'm in gold
 TichHuyen: I am in gold
 struct: didnt you get legend Scarfield?
 DollarAkshay: I am in gold
 TichHuyen: My last submit is around 100 in gold
 Scarfield: nope
 struct: oh my bad
 Scarfield: i have an imposter :o
 struct: I thought you did
 TichHuyen: but any improve from me make it worse
 Astrobytes: Scaryfield
 struct: TichHuyen look at what top players do and try to copy their strategy
 MindController: Can give tips on my strat
 GlaceCoding: triple wind with 2 heroes…
 struct: I currently use 1 attacker and 2 defenders
 struct: my attacker is mediocre at best
 struct: and im top 100 gold
 TichHuyen: should I look the tops on Lengend or just the top on gold?
 struct: Top legend
 GlaceCoding: legend
 struct: or people that are about to get promoted on gold
 MindController: 1 attack 2 defend
 Whiskee: I lose like 100% of the matches against triple defender and double  attacker and I'm still second in gold
 MindController: Is very easy to code
 Scarfield: maybe i will get there tomorrow, but doubt it&#160;:'(
 Whiskee: don't try to counter everything
 struct: if they have a big lead
 MindController: And works quite well
 struct: my attacker doesnt even farm
 struct: at the start
 struct: it just stays still for 40 turns xD
 Whiskee: I think I had a match against you when you were still doing 3 defenders
 struct: probably
 Whiskee: I hate those walls, I gave up trying to win at points
 Scarfield: the code i have scrambled together for this contest is the ugliest code i have made in a long time
 struct: if code is like that I gues
 TichHuyen: I use 2 def 1 att, so I think I should find the same strategy
 struct: I can describe my AI
 struct: Opponents heroes dont exist
 struct: If I cant see a spider it doesnt exist
 struct: If close to base I wind it
 struct: thats it
 Scarfield: o0
 TichHuyen: 0o
 TichHuyen: very the same as me
 struct: I dix fix the wind so I aim based on spider pos
 MindController: My only differnce
 struct: on the attacker
 MindController: Is i sometimes control enemy hero when attacking
 Miki09: struct you use 2 def + 1 att?
 struct: yes
 Miki09: And what place r u?
 TichHuyen: so we are same on this point too
 struct: 90 gold
 Miki09: O.O
 TichHuyen: do you use control?
 MindController: Miki09
 struct: no
 MindController: Im using 1 attacker 2 deffenders
 struct: I only use wind
 MindController: Im 4th in legend
 Miki09: lol
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629474451">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629474451</a>
 struct: my attacker stays still for 40 turns
 TichHuyen: the last submit I am around 100 gold too
 struct: as you can see
 TichHuyen: I stay for 50turns
 struct: Anyways I need to go back to coding, cya all later and gl
 TichHuyen: we are quite the same :D
 Miki09: strcut should I inspire from fact that you dont use shield and u r 90 in gold?
 TichHuyen: I use shield and wind and now 100 gold
 Scarfield: gl&#160;:)
 MindController: Miki09 no shield rank 4 legend
 struct: Miki09 I just copy others strategy
 TichHuyen: add control and everything stucked
 struct: I dont see many at the top using shield
 Miki09: Ok I'll inspire&#160;:-)
 TichHuyen: I will try remove my shield
 struct: when you wind a spider its like 5.5 turns of movement
 struct: Which is a lot
 MindController: Shield is sometimes good on attacking
 MindController: But its hard to make it effective
 struct: if I have 2 defenders attacking a shielded spider its 20 damage
 TichHuyen: but some time you wind opponent too?
 TobiasA: I wish I could copy other people's strats
 struct: And I get mana for that
 TichHuyen: ah
 struct: I think Wind is better value than shield
 TichHuyen: remove shield should be good
 struct: because you can wind multiple but can only shield one
 cegprakash: TobiasA what's stopping u
 TichHuyen: I cast shield too much and it wastes my mana
 struct: Unless you are using shield very late
 TichHuyen: oh, very nice
 struct: I dont think its worth to cast a shield on a spider if the dist and health == N
 TobiasA: my mental capability:smiley:
 TichHuyen: then I can use shield at very late, you make a lot of insight view, thanks
 struct: some math formula should do it
 struct: But I can be totally wrong
 HoriMiyamura: I think it should called inspire view..
 HoriMiyamura:&#160;:(
 struct: I never tried to use shield on spiders
 HoriMiyamura: I am going to implement your propose
 MindController: Its just
 HoriMiyamura: as I am stuck at 100 gold for now
 MindController: If ur planning to use control on enemy defenders
 MindController: Its sometimes more effective to use shield
 struct: Yes needs to  be a mix of both
 struct: but when does it become better than wind?
 struct: Probably hard to say
 MindController: When out of wind range
 MindController:&#160;:)
 Enknable: also if the enemy is going to cast a spell that will do some critical thing, control cancels it
 struct: oh nice
 struct: Thanks for the idea
 Enknable: ..i thnk lol
 MindController: Enknable but the problem is
 MindController: U newwd to guess 2 turn into future
 struct: you need to see 2 turns ahead
 struct: yeah
 MindController: So its just easier
 MindController: To shield
 Miki09: Am I cursed if I have my_players={} instead of my_players=[]&#160;?
 struct: Thanks MindController
 struct: You gave me an idea
 struct: :D
 struct: hard to close chat when so much ideas are given
 MindController: I can also give u even better idea
 Enknable: true. Unless you think of it like: If I can interrupt 2/4 of his casts
 MindController: Dont afk on first turns
 Enknable: its worth the missed casts
 MindController:&#160;:)
 struct: :D
 TichHuyen: I also have a lot of idea
 Enknable: but def a good point tho
 TichHuyen: and adding them make my bot go down&#160;:(
 struct: Thanks again for all the tips, I will close the chat for real this time
 _NikJ: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629484821">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629484821</a>, turn 65-67, why did monster 41 (top left base) get stuck? o.O
 MindController: Ur pushing from the perspective of your hero, but not the monster
 MindController: U need to change the wind
 MindController: to push from monster to base
 MindController: Not from hero to base
 _NikJ: as in, I need to change condition on which I use wind?
 MindController: Nope
 MindController: U need to change
 Scarfield: map edges inside bases are "sticky", monsters cant leave borders when inside bases, if they hit a wall, they stop there
 MindController: The wind coordinates
 MindController: Tip: conditions doesnt change
 MindController: The wind coordinates changes
 _NikJ: ah, I keep it simple, if my base is 0,0 I wind at map_width, if I'm at map_width, I wind at 0,0 xd
 Scarfield: wind direction is difference in position of monster and op base, still simple&#160;;)
 ClockSort: people are very generous with their ideas and algs -- thanks&#160;:)
 hiamkaito:  Can i change my base in "Play my code" button?
 ClockSort: hiamkaito no
 _NikJ: Yeah, MindController helped me very much with some ideas (basically, KISS - keep it simple, stupid)
 struct: hiamkaito you can change which player you play as
 stolyaroleh: Yes, you have to delete both players and then assign yourself to the right one, hiamkaito
 struct: if thats what you are asking
 Scarfield: yes hiamkaito, left of play my code, you can see the players, delete both, and put yourself as player 2 and whoever as player 1
 ClockSort: ok, so I was wrong&#160;:)
 Zyk0: You're still there struct
 TichHuyen: isn't that you said you would close the chat struct?
 ClockSort: lol
 TichHuyen: and you still here
 struct: sry, im out
 TichHuyen: :D
 Astrobytes: he can't help it :D
 Scarfield: xD
 hiamkaito: Thanks all , i'll try:kissing_heart:
 ClockSort: my goal is to type more chars of source code than chars into chat
 VizGhar: What does CG use for showing games on the canvas?
 Astrobytes: pixi.js
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: tnx Astro
 Astrobytes: np
 ntsd: I win the gold boss but I can't pass 1000 players in the gold league.
 TichHuyen: my new bot beat the account that above the boss and still stick around 400
 stolyaroleh: overfitting?
 TichHuyen: not sure
 ntsd: Yep the strategy create for the boss only lol
 TichHuyen: but yes, it just doesn't work with others
 VizGhar: overfit on everybody then "D
 Miki09: hello VizGhar
 VizGhar: hello Miki09
 Uljahn: hello Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you can try to make it easy to use
 VizGhar: as Automaton2000 says... just a few ifs and you are good to go
 Automaton2000: it's not gonna be a good way
 Miki09: Automaton2000 are you in legend league?
 Automaton2000: so you want to take a break and come back to that
 Miki09: Automaton2000 You are so smart
 Automaton2000: if you want to learn the basics first
 Miki09: ok
 MindController: Automaton2000 not participating in this contest?
 Automaton2000: now i just need to look up
 TichHuyen: I am thinking could I use my super power to go to legend
 rockyyyyyyy123: Im new to here
 TichHuyen: like I look the leaderboard and then bang
 TichHuyen: I am legend
 TichHuyen: but I am not sure If my super power is strong enough to do that?
 TichHuyen: and can it be before the contest end?
 Scarfield: hi new to here
 Scarfield: heh. heh. ugh, but welcome rockyyyyyyy123&#160;:)
 TichHuyen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629501673">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629501673</a> what to do with this 3 def&#160;:(
 MindController: TichHuyen u couldve done 1 damage at frame 120
 MindController: If u just walked up
 MindController: And wind monster again
 MindController: Instead of shield
 TichHuyen: well I've tried to add that but other things break
 TichHuyen: but I would try again then
 rockyyyyyyy123: Hello scarfield
 Scarfield: here for the contest?
 jacek: for the protest
 Scarfield: you are a pro tester arent you
 MindController: jacek who are we protesting against?
 jacek: contesters
 Kururugi: i am gonna protest against protestors
 Astrobytes: I must contest your protest
 struct: is this a sign?

 struct:&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: bye struct, thanks for your service
 Scarfield: lol not again
 VizGhar: I've reached legend and I've lost interest immediately... is this normal? :D
 HoriMiyamura: no
 HoriMiyamura: it is not normal
 Scarfield: grats though&#160;:)
 Scarfield: do you still owe a pc?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the game
 eulerscheZahl: usually it's not normal but this time i am with you
 HoriMiyamura: you should: I've been legend, then now I will get CG Tshirt
 HoriMiyamura: This is the normal
 eulerscheZahl: there are no new designs, are there?
 HoriMiyamura: I don't know
 HoriMiyamura: but we should have T shirt if in top 20 right?
 HoriMiyamura: I've never had one
 eulerscheZahl: mission "win a tshirt for struct to consolidate him for the deleted account"
 HoriMiyamura: so...
 HoriMiyamura: oh
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: yes, top20 are the tshirt ranks
 HoriMiyamura: struct said that?
 Astrobytes: *console not consolidate eulerscheZahl
 struct: I will get legend
 LaurensD: We trust you struct, you can do it!
 struct: There is no way I cant improve my bot
 Astrobytes: or "as consolation for his deleted account"
 VizGhar: Scarfield no I dont owe... student didn't break me
 HoriMiyamura: my bug code currently computing 38% and rank 7x in gold
 eulerscheZahl: oh, consolidate is what CG and coderpad did?
 HoriMiyamura: is this mean my fixed-bug code would be much higher?
 Scarfield: consoling might consolidating him
 Astrobytes: in that they consolidated their resources I guess, yes
 eulerscheZahl: i memorized that vocabulary wrong, thanks for pointing it out
 eulerscheZahl: a little better every day
 Astrobytes: np, I am always happy to improve your English :D
 eulerscheZahl: (no trolling, tell me when i write nonsense)
 Scarfield: nice VizGhar, also i kinda rooted for your student though :p
 HoriMiyamura: haha 
 VizGhar: understandable
 Astrobytes: Always do&#160;:)
 VizGhar: I would too
 Astrobytes: (I always tell you I mean)
 eulerscheZahl: a private teacher for free
 Astrobytes: knowledge is free, if I can share it and it's useful then :tada:
 Kururugi: how do i share a replay from my last battles? Is there a way to create the replay link?
 cegprakash: if gold is this competitive I wonder how legend league would be right now
 cegprakash: there would be 50 strats from 200 ppl
 TobiasA: but seriously this gold boss seems like a bot from legend
 Astrobytes: um... technically it is
 cegprakash: gold boss is just wind spammer
 TobiasA: it won't even let me get mana it just keeps attacking
 HoriMiyamura: because no bot for legend :D
 cegprakash: I'm not really worried about the gold boss
 Astrobytes: maybe if you were you'd be in legend
 5DN1L: Use the REPLAY AND SHARE button just below the replay, Kururugi
 cegprakash: it's the top 300 in gold I'm worried about lol so many strats here with almost 2000 ppl in gold
 eulerscheZahl: legend is a zoo as well
 cegprakash: we need a Ultra legend league
 cegprakash: -_-
 HoriMiyamura: 2 atts&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: quiz for the veterans: which quote did i modify?
 Astrobytes: "multiplayer is a zoo"
 HoriMiyamura: :A
 eulerscheZahl: point for Astro
 Scarfield: "Germany is a zoo"&#160;?
 cegprakash: or just convert all current leages 1 tier lower make Bronze2 as Bronze 3, Legend as gold so we have one more league
 cegprakash: only 20 should be in legend not 200
 cegprakash: at least at this point
 eulerscheZahl: no, we are an inclusive community now
 eulerscheZahl: and heursitic games always have more legend players
 TichHuyen: I remember when early for this contest, I submit the default code that "WAIT" all the time
 TichHuyen: and go to wood1
 TobiasA: phew :cold_sweat: i'm giving up on this contest i'll try to get to legend like next year
 TichHuyen: why next year?
 Lysk: yeah that waiting is the sadest part
 TichHuyen: how about the other challeng in next 6 months?
 cegprakash: TobiasA don't give up with just 1 day to go + sleep time
 Scarfield: dont expect a bot contest next year though. not that i wont to poke that hornets nest of a discussion, just saying there might not be one TobiasA
 TobiasA: That's how long I usually procrastinate cg games that stress me
 Astrobytes: &lt;incoming salty hornets&gt;
 TobiasA: I believe CG can only get better after this:slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: (or salted? :thinking: )
 TobiasA: i hope
 TichHuyen: I really like the bot contests on CG, why you procrastinate it?
 TichHuyen: If this challenge have 4 time a year, then I will participate actively
 TobiasA: I like them too by procrastinate I mean I do other ones then come back to that one later
 TichHuyen: umm
 Astrobytes: that's called "putting it on the back burner"
 TichHuyen: I also play on the last few days
 TobiasA: yea I put it on the back burner
 Scarfield: some people work better when not under time pressure, its for fun. to each their own way of having fun&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: like, downgrading its priority
 MichExpatMatt: I got lazy and curmudgeony about this one, still sitting in silver with basically a bunch of if/else's and a pythagorean function
 Astrobytes: curmudgeons unite
 MichExpatMatt: no trig and never touched vx or vy
 MichExpatMatt: no nn or minimax or graph theory or anything like that
 Astrobytes: you can sit in gold or legend with that if you improve your ifs
 jacek: or else?
 Astrobytes: my money's on the ifs :P
 TobiasA: or else what?
 MichExpatMatt: see that's all I was going for. Still need to up my mana farming but without letting the big guy's touch my base in the last half or third of game
 Jazzcript: Hi, is there any way  select player from legend, when at gold league?
 MichExpatMatt: hell maybe even rearranging the order of all the if/elses, I'm always changing my mind or watching a game I lose and trying to address that one reason I lost that one time
 Astrobytes: No, unless you request a replay from someone in legend and you are top 1000
 MichExpatMatt: I can beat the Boss in IDE but doesn't seem to help me in arena/leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: can't find Jazzcript as opponent in selection
 Astrobytes: watch a bunch of games and try to generalise the reasons for the losses
 eulerscheZahl: the opponent selection is such a 5% feature, useless for the rest
 eulerscheZahl: trolling aside, for CSB you really can't select that many players percent-wise
 Astrobytes: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: indeed yes indeed
 eulerscheZahl: struct would indeed confirm
 Astrobytes: 1 == 2 or whatever he said
 struct: yes indeed 1 | 2 = 3 indeed
 struct: or w/e
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: i dumped my search bot, too many flaws. now i'm around 30 again while search was bottom of the league :tear:
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:'
 eulerscheZahl: no emoji?
 Astrobytes: :crying:
 struct:&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: :cry:
 Astrobytes: dammit
 eulerscheZahl: that one
 jacek: :frog:
 struct: missing a (
 Scarfield:&#160;: ' (&#160;:'(
 struct: at the end
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i expected :sob: for&#160;: cry&#160;:
 jacek: :sweat:
 Astrobytes: turn on your air conditioning jacek
 eulerscheZahl: you have air conditioning?
 Astrobytes: No.
 eulerscheZahl: i have a fan for hot summer days
 Astrobytes: Same.
 HoriMiyamura: me too
 HoriMiyamura: a fan
 Astrobytes: It broke though. Thankfully summer in Scotland isn't very hot
 MichExpatMatt: I am in Arizona, if I didn't have air conditioning over here I might not actually survive the summer
 Astrobytes: Well, not thankfully, I miss the nice weather
 eulerscheZahl: i also have a lot of fans on CG. broke the 1000 mark now
 Astrobytes: ba-dum-tsss
 Astrobytes: he's here all week folks
 eulerscheZahl: a sheep, a drum and a snake fall down a cliff. da-dum-tsss
 MichExpatMatt: :laugh:
 Astrobytes: *baa-dum-tsss
 MichExpatMatt: oh FFS
 eulerscheZahl: the sheep was so surprised for falling first, that it only got out a "ba"
 Astrobytes: it was a "da"
 <b>**Astrobytes awaits the excuses</b></p><p><img src="/a/78672341302451" /> MichExpatMatt: ta-da

 eulerscheZahl: i know the last 3 letters
 Astrobytes: in fact, never gonna click that one
 VizGhar: :D you already know by url? mg :D
 Astrobytes: yep
 jacek: how?
 Astrobytes: you
 eulerscheZahl: there is a guy totally dedicated about rickrolling
 VizGhar: I have to shorten it
 VizGhar: yeah? where?
 eulerscheZahl: once invested $1500 to show the video as a youtube ad
 Astrobytes: lol, that is some dedication right there
 VizGhar: oh... well, he buys it so
 eulerscheZahl: and paid a sky writer to draw it over the superbowl stadium
 MichExpatMatt: someone has too much money
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8JexGCZEo&amp;ab_channel=TheTekkitRealm">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8JexGCZEo&amp;ab_channel=TheTekkitRealm</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure he gets that money back with youtube range on his channel
 jacek: how about next contest about rick rolling :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: he also likes to get hired by companies just to mess around and get fired. e.g. as a tictoc moderator
 eulerscheZahl: once he got hired by indian scammers to build them a new website. and he just deleted all of it
 MichExpatMatt: omg that's awesome
 dusk_sd: chad
 Astrobytes: guy's got some style lol
 AmbF: For the Spring Code Challenge (python), i get issues where i'm not correctly reading the input data even though i'm not removing any input. Any ideas why?
 Astrobytes: extra output perhaps, maybe printing something to stdout that isn't the 3 required lines
 Astrobytes: or an extra newline, etc 
 Astrobytes: make sure any debug printing goes to stderr
 GalvaBart: @AmbF did you check the starter code on github?
 AmbF: Ah i see what i did wrong now thanks&#160;!
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AmbF: Yes yes i was just moving AND doing a spell
 AmbF: Totally forgot about the output limit
 Astrobytes: good catch&#160;:)
 AmbF: thanks
 GalvaBart: I forgot to print SPELL and was wondering why my wind command was crashing XD
 DollarAkshay: How close should I let monsters before using wind spell&#160;?
 Astrobytes: 42
 GalvaBart: Range is 2200 I think
 MichExpatMatt: wind range is 1280, shield and control are 2200
 LaurensD: at the section spells you got a range
 GalvaBart: oops no, it's 1280
 LaurensD: wind is 1280
 LaurensD: All entities (except your own heroes) within 1280 units are pushed 2200 units in the direction from the spellcaster to x,y.
 Westicles: do you get double xp/cp for contest leagues then later the multi?
 Astrobytes: I am guessing he means how close to the base should he let them get before winding them away
 struct: not anymore
 Astrobytes: lol indeed
 GalvaBart: Will this bot challenge be available after the event?
 Astrobytes: yes
 GalvaBart: awesome
 MichExpatMatt: ahh who knows. if they are even in my base and unshielded, I like to yeet them out of the base if possible, I'd rather get wild mana while hitting them if possible
 Astrobytes: it will move to compete-&gt;bot programming
 eulerscheZahl: might take 2 or 3 days until you can play it again
 DollarAkshay: Yeah how close to my base should I let them be
 eulerscheZahl: or is it sponsored and won't come back? no idea actually
 DollarAkshay: I feel like I am over using wind spell to defend my base
 MichExpatMatt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31f603fe-f3fe-4ea4-ab7d-cae07dffcd88">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31f603fe-f3fe-4ea4-ab7d-cae07dffcd88</a>
 LaurensD: Dollar it depends on strat
 eulerscheZahl: did we get confirmation about the future of the game?
 DollarAkshay: Single defender
 Astrobytes: Don't think so, but doesn't seem to be sponsored despite previous use. That is a good point now I think on it.
 jacek: eulerscheZahl maybe itll be reused once again in next contest
 eulerscheZahl: :upside_down:
 cegprakash: DollarAkshay I use based on danger level
 cegprakash: more danger more wind
 LaurensD: @MichExpatMatt like this&#160;:? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629482516">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629482516</a>
 MichExpatMatt: LaurensD hahaha kind of! But in my case it's usually my 2-3 guys defending and one attacker pushing back
 MichExpatMatt: omg that was wild though, like your guys got offended and decided to just kamikaze the enemy base
 GalvaBart: I'm curious how alphaStar would fare XD
 LaurensD: haha, yeah made that for fun it's in the arena but not performing that well though haha
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628667511">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628667511</a>
 LaurensD: but there are some interesting video's to watch haha
 MichExpatMatt: I tried shielding myself more often based on whether an opp was close enough to cast control... but seemed like a waste of mana and base started taking more damage
 MichExpatMatt: ok I gtg for now have an appointment in like 17 min but might be back to mess with this later
 LaurensD: You might want to make a simple check when one of your hero's will get controlled, it'll raises a flag and start doing that
 LaurensD: at least that is a option you do have to preserve your mana for like &gt; 50% of the matches
 LaurensD: haha good luck
 LaurensD: oh, pushing can happen too :3
 LaurensD: can't find the many reflections one but this one does seem interesting
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628648963">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628648963</a>
 AmbF: What breaks ties, total mana collected or mana left&#160;?
 qwertzui11: check the "wild mana" in the description
 Astrobytes: wild mana
 MichExpatMatt: LaurensD what criteria would you be thinking for the check though... I think my old check was like... if an opp is within 2200 of my guy, or within one turn or being in that range
 AmbF: I see great thanks
 MichExpatMatt: but then it seemed like my guys were spamming shiled on themselves unnecessarily
 Boopitibap: Do the certification tests test anything other than if the tests pass? Like time complexity, memory usage, etc? I got 99 percentile but I highly doubt that score, feels like it is simply because the tests passed
 5DN1L: no they don't
 5DN1L: CG said they would fix the percentage quite some time ago...
 5DN1L: not sure about their progress
 Boopitibap: That makes more sense, thank you
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 _NikJ: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629595775">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629595775</a> well that was quick
 FaRNaM.Hs: Hey!
 DollarAkshay: Fingers crossed I hope I get out of Gold with this submit&#160;:(
 jacek: back to silver?
 DollarAkshay: :joy:
 DollarAkshay: Thank god there is no demotion in CG
 DollarAkshay: That would be brutal
 LaurensD: @MichExpatmatt, yeah that seems to be a fine condition, this this will also assume when your enemy crosses you, or one enemy is near your base for example. It will make you waste your mana, hence the control check on the hero, thought that might help
 Westicles: I think the ML version that shows up and wins at the last minute won't have clear delineation between attackers and defenders
 LaurensD: for wind you can probably do a check your last position is &gt; distance away from the current, which probably might mean you were hit with wind. or something in that familiar
 TobiasA: that kind of bot sounds unstable
 LaurensD: Yup, thought it depends, I assume you cannot connect to external resources right?
 LaurensD: I mean ML gotta learn
 TobiasA: you actually can but I haven't done it before
 TobiasA: what I was trying to say is that a bot that doesn't have clear delineation between attackers and defenders I picture it being unstable but what do I know i've never done anything complex:relaxed:
 jacek: ML? mars lander?
 LaurensD: Machine learning
 LaurensD: @TobiasA I guess it could get a distinction for attacking defending :3
 TobiasA: most likely
 LaurensD: let's make a socket and control it ourselfs :grinning:
 TobiasA: what's a socket?
 avdg: depends on context
 TobiasA: or what context
 TobiasA: python or the one you can stick a fork in
 _NikJ: pretty sure you can only stick a fork once
 LaurensD: Socket is used for realtime communication between client and server
 TobiasA: oh i believe I could stick a fork in that kind of socket more than once
 LaurensD: And context would be when the bot runs that you 'are' the player.
 LaurensD: Really? Let's try it then
 LaurensD: be sure to use a fork that is full metal
 TobiasA: I tried it :slight_smile:
 TobiasA: now my screen is broken
 LaurensD: Perhaps you turned it off by doing that
 LaurensD: try again
 TobiasA: mhm I did it again
 cegprakash: if I do CTRL+F and do username + " failed" it should give all the failed movements right? Is there any other invalid moves that's not covered by this CTRL+F
 cegprakash: i.e in the game information log
 DustinNunyo: Hmm... There isn't a way to use type hints and function overloading in the challenges is there?
 DollarAkshay: hey which was that website where you could see the win rate against specific opponents&#160;?
 DustinNunyo: I am using python3 btw
 DollarAkshay: I remeber someone from the community made a website where you could analyze to whom you are loosing 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/</a>

 44AA44: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playfreeminecraft.farted.net">https://playfreeminecraft.farted.net</a> is cool too
 jacek: oO
 DollarAkshay: Damn where are there no contests&#160;?
 jacek: maybe CG doesnt expose them
 _NikJ: what do you mean no contests? I'm using cg stats to track my submission&#160;% while away
 Counterbalance: it's listed there, but can't find any players
 jacek: oh, its down there on the spinner
 _NikJ: player has to be in top 1000 I believe
 Counterbalance: ow, cors errors.. ofcors.

 cegprakash: are u sure u are in the range Aland_52879
 cegprakash: at turn 125 it gets pushed properly
 Aland_52879: yes i'm in range but sometimes my hero spams the wind 
 Aland_52879: is there any reason that causes wind spell to be spammed by a hero? i can't figure out what is the cause of it
 Noyotens: how to get rid of "wild mana collecters"
 LaurensD: It's a multi-turn thing, your code is still triggered by your criteria Aland
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/58f12880-7175-4638-9c93-76c955e7a86c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/58f12880-7175-4638-9c93-76c955e7a86c</a>
 cegprakash: Aland u are not in range buddy
 cegprakash: Aland_52879
 LaurensD: seems like he was talking about the spamming of the wind
 cegprakash: he is spamming coz he thinks the monster is close to him
 cegprakash: I mean his code thinks
 cegprakash: no offence to Aland_52879
 Aland_52879: exactly he thinks the monster is close but looks like your calculation proves i have to look into the range check again. thank you guys
 Aland_52879: it's okay. Thank you for help&#160;:) 
 LaurensD: you can try to execute the calculations of cegprakash with your dinstance calculation
 LaurensD: for a fast check
 cegprakash: I use this website <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-plane/distance-two-points.php">https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-plane/distance-two-points.php</a>

 MindController: 2 attackers - Blasterpoard fan
 nalka0: When you control a monster, are its vx and vy changed according to where the control is gonna send it?
 LaurensD: for a fan, you sure did loose
 LaurensD: lose*
 cegprakash: I'm glad I lost to a Blasterpoard fan
 cegprakash: -_-
 peerdb: Does anyone know where I could find how the ELO is calculated?
 CaptainHamburger: U win u gain some, u lose u lose some

 avdg: hmm I have not much hopes for gold
 qwertzui11: me neither :D
 avdg: Im in the back of gold
 avdg: at least, hope for getting in the top in gold league
 LaurensD: 1940 of 1970  with my fun bot
 avdg: the defense I've just added seemed already useless to the nr ai
 avdg: *to the ai
 avdg: an ai needs to be sharp from the start to beat the boos
 avdg: or I need a very good goally ai
 cegprakash: If I don't go to legend in this submit u can call me a "cockroach" for the next 7 days
 avdg: hmm what is your rank now?
 avdg: and no, I will take into account that it takes a while to get on top of the ladder
 cegprakash: 18% progress 4 losses in first 27 games
 avdg: aw, way better than my ai
 avdg: my current submission has an experimental piece of code
 avdg: gonna see how much influence it has
 DustinNunyo: Hey could somebody tell me; if I have a circle at a certain position with a certain radius; how do I get the x/y position of say a 45 degree angle around that circle?
 Tuo: you know the first point?
 DaNinja: x+cos(angle)*r, y+sin(angle)*r
 DustinNunyo: TY!
 DaNinja: where r is in radians
 DaNinja: * angle in radians
 pmor: isn't r the radius, and angle is in radians?
 pmor:&#160;:)
 DaNinja:&#160;;)
 cegprakash: look like I'm gonna be called as a cockroach
 cegprakash: but it's at 26% too early to call
 avdg: maybe I'll code something different tomorrow
 avdg: I'm bit running out of ideas after implementing some stuff that others noticed
 avdg: something a bit more in the direction that is useful, hopefully
 avdg: well, there is 1 thing in my ai that never worked, but it didn't seem to have a big impact
 cegprakash: show me a replay with u
 cegprakash: avdg
 cegprakash: I give u idea
 cegprakash: if I find any flaw
 cegprakash: I'm waiting on my submit and bored
 cegprakash: :D
 avdg: oh lol
 cegprakash: yeah my strat is too boring and even hate to watch my own replays
 cegprakash: lol
 avdg: nah, I'm not bored, it's just, I better want to put resources in something I learn more
 avdg: all that matters now is throwing out bugs or come up with a system to throw them out
 cegprakash: just share a replay&#160;:)

 cegprakash: preferably against me
 avdg: k, gonna run some games against your ai

 cegprakash: first replay turn 13 to 17 what are u doing yhyoxx
 cegprakash: :P
 cegprakash: ur defender just randomly wandering
 yhyoxx: haha yea
 cegprakash: in 2nd replay same happens for first 30 turns
 cegprakash: I have more than double ur mana in first 30 turns yhyoxx
 cegprakash: fix ur early game
 yhyoxx: yup 
 yhyoxx: thank you
 cegprakash: u rekt me in both games tho
 cegprakash: nice
 cegprakash: oh actually 2nd game I won
 cegprakash: that was a hole in my defense in first game
 cegprakash: :P
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629671613">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629671613</a>
 cegprakash: yea
 cegprakash: wind in center is kinda waste of mana
 avdg: maybe it's a bug that only occurs when I'm on the right side
 cegprakash: what are ur 2 defenders doing till turn 9 avdg
 cegprakash: they like chilling huh
 cegprakash: :D
 avdg: oh, missed that
 cegprakash: hehe
 avdg: ah, attacking code that broke
 cegprakash: I am looking at ur fog of war
 cegprakash: debug mode fog of war only urself
 cegprakash: that way easy to notice these
 avdg: and no, my ai doesn't work with roles
 avdg: it works with relative position to others
 avdg: and task queues
 avdg: man, yesterday I was like, ok, these heroes don't have a move, just push them forward, nope
 cegprakash: ur shield usage is also bad avdg
 cegprakash: u are using shield from middle of the board
 cegprakash: and ur wind direction is also bad
 cegprakash: in same replay
 avdg: yeah, the limitations might be better be more strict
 cegprakash: make a functionbool shouldUseWind(Hero, Monster) {
 avdg: it's already like that :p
 avdg: just need different checks
 DustinNunyo: I'm having a bit of trouble converting degrees to radians. I assume that this is the correct way?
 avdg: fixed the first moves: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629681017">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629681017</a>
 cegprakash: how many conditions do u have in wind function for defending
 avdg: hmm depends, but many
 cegprakash: DustinNunyo
 avdg: though not worked out completely
 cegprakash: long double radians(long double degrees) {	return degrees * PI / 180.0;}
 DaNinja: cos(degrees * PI / 180.0)
 cegprakash: I have 16 comparision statements inside my denfending wind condition avdg
 avdg: lol
 avdg: my ifs are kinda messy and recalculating stuff a lot there
 avdg: but lazy to fix because my ai still runs under a ms a turn
 avdg: my ai timings are in stderr
 cegprakash: anyone else want to share a replay with me -_- I can help till my submit ends.. it's at 50% now
 struct: I think this was reported yesterday right?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629683836">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629683836</a>
 struct: frame 181-182
 struct: The spiders that go out
 struct: The Rng wont handle them symetrical
 struct: I only share replays with bugs
 cegprakash: don't get struct what's the monster id
 avdg: hmm sending spiders back might be hard to do fairly unless the referee keeps track where they are send
 avdg: one approuch I think of (but I guess others may do better) is keep track of distance to travel to the other side
 struct: 134 and 135
 struct: they will go in different directions
 avdg: maybe combined with how close they get to the base
 struct: But I guess this is fine
 struct: I can live with this bug
 avdg: or keep a list of send back directions and shuffle for both sides
 struct: Was just confused on why my bot didnt draw
 avdg: then it's random, but in a closed set
 struct: since I have symmetry
 avdg: (a bit like tetris)
 cegprakash: struct wind from inside the ring to outside right
 cegprakash: I heard it's random direction
 struct: yes
 struct: its random and non symmetrical it seems
 cegprakash: yeah
 avdg: need to check referee
 struct: no need
 struct: the replay is proof
 cegprakash: I'm above gold boss for the first time ever
 cegprakash: hope my points maintain
 struct: gl
 struct: should my defenders think before my attacker 
 struct: :thinking:
 cegprakash: lol struct
 cegprakash: it's independent right
 struct: no due to mana
 cegprakash: I think for attacker before defender but keep at least 10 mana for my defenders
 struct: I see
 cegprakash: u can do the same reverse 
 cegprakash: if u are confident with ur attacker
 cegprakash: my attacker is a pleb attacker
 cegprakash: lol
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L327">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L327</a>
 avdg: hmm
 avdg: that else part should do the redirection I think
 struct: so it seems its not working properly
 struct: unplayable
 struct: I hope they add 1 more week to the contest due to this bug
 struct:&#160;:)
 cegprakash:         random = new Random(this.seed);
 cegprakash: so it'll give diff values for directions for both players right
 struct: I'll check it once I reach legend
 avdg: it should use a random number pool
 cegprakash: they should have a random for each player if it should generate same random value for both players in order
 avdg: though with a circle, it's still hard to make it fair
 avdg: the same direction has an other effect on an other place of the circle
 avdg: though I think it will still be a bit more fair
 LaurensD: Haha this version of the bot is still at the beginning, with only defending lol I wonder how far I can come with xD
 LaurensD: gotta stop anyways
 avdg:&#160;?
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629699799">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629699799</a>
 avdg: and laurens did you get progress?
 avdg: I would keep 1 close to the home base
 LaurensD: A little bit, started over hoping to get a decent system, which is probably too complicated lol
 Zandy156: I can't believe how many challenges come with just grouping monsters. 
 avdg: even with my ai keeping 1 at the back, it still gets suprised sometimes by monsters slipping through to the base
 LaurensD: previous bot was okay, but gold was his limit =P want to make a tad smarter and more efficient bot
 LaurensD: Haha thanks for the tip, wanted to have a midpoint at the very least today so the combat mechanic is just the closest with a few conditions =P
 LaurensD: gonna hurt my head over it tomorrow, likely
 LaurensD: but it's so fun :nerd:
 cegprakash: laurnensD may be top 1000 gold not more than that LaurensD.. 
 yhyoxx: cg should let us run our own servers for running arena tests 
 cegprakash: almost everyone in top 1000 has an attacker
 yhyoxx: some blockchain type of architecture
 nalka0: I don't cegprakash
 CaptainHamburger: Nagatsuka_Akiya doesnt attack and is 45th in legend
 LaurensD: @cegprakash was like 1300 ish, if I recall correctly
 cegprakash: nalka0 u have a crazy defense xD
 LaurensD: doing it mostly for fun at this point
 cegprakash: I can't kill u -_-
 cegprakash: soon to be a legend bot and I can't kill u
 LaurensD: self proclaimed soon to be legend bot
 LaurensD: :joy:
 cegprakash: check the leaderboard LaurensD
 nalka0: haha well i think you can pass it if you try several times, it has issues with keeping an eye on what happens in the middle (and sadly that's from here that most people attack)
 LaurensD: oeh! nice!
 LaurensD: congrats :D
 cegprakash: nalka0 most attacks are sneaky
 nalka0: The previous versions of me were beating boss 5, didn't try it with the latest ones
 cegprakash: and unpredictable
 cegprakash: especially coz defending is not easy
 Zandy156: I haven't figured out what makes the legend bots so good yet. There seem to be so many different strategies.
 yhyoxx: how to climb&#160;?
 nalka0: Well the way people attack most of the time is predictable but i meant probably need to keep my center hero more often in the center to have vision on monsters coming in the center
 yhyoxx: optimize against boss&#160;? against top bots in the leaderboard&#160;? against legends&#160;?
 nalka0: (by center i mean center of my base)
 yhyoxx: against everyone&#160;?
 LaurensD: can't press play my code, odd
 LaurensD: test in arena is possible lol
 LaurensD: oh
 LaurensD: Lost a player, whoopsy
 nalka0: cegprakash i did a quick BO9 with the boss, he 5-3'd me but when i won i obliterated his wild mana
 LaurensD: my first win, lmao did not expect that :3 
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629721915">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629721915</a>
 LaurensD: Won against twitter :3
 Tuo: nalka0 gold boss spends a lot of time in early game winding in enemy base not collecting any mana
 cegprakash: nalka0 gold boss' atacker never uses anything other than wind
 cegprakash: wind is defendable without self shield
 cegprakash: just have to do counter wind
 Tuo: tho it gets rewarded for it, at least against my bot :angry:
 cegprakash: but the ladder is much harder nalka0
 nalka0: well if you never shield the issue is plenty people are just control chaining you heroes
 nalka0: And except being shielded, you can't defend against that imo
 nalka0: If gold boss is that easy, why is it dropping so slowly though?
 Tuo: with 2 defenders you could wait untill detecting control and only after go for counter measures
 nalka0: I prefer preventive shielding, i do it when my hero is already in a good position and i have at least nearly 100 mana
 cegprakash: boss is rank 8 in goold
 cegprakash: and boss is down to 29
 HoriMiyamura: too many legend
 HoriMiyamura: I will be one of the next legend :D
 HoriMiyamura: should I say: "I am being a legend"
 cegprakash:  Promotion to Legend League in&#160;:00H 00MN 11SC
 HoriMiyamura: I just run 45 mins
 HoriMiyamura: 45%
 Westicles: nice job ceg
 HoriMiyamura: still wait a lot
 HoriMiyamura: next goal should be top 20?
 cegprakash: finally
 HoriMiyamura: well
 HoriMiyamura: I increase 1 rank thank to you :D
 nalka0: So you're telling me I beat legends? :p
 cegprakash: ty Westicles
 yhyoxx: gg ceg
 cegprakash: I'm coming for the T shirt
 cegprakash: top 20 T shirt is it
 HoriMiyamura: I have never have a T shirt
 HoriMiyamura: I am coming for it too
 HoriMiyamura: do you have any CG Tshirt ceg?
 cegprakash: no lol
 HoriMiyamura:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: my best rank was like top 200ish only
 cegprakash: and I usually get legend in 50% of the contests and end up in gold/silver in others
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: how close you need to be for wind to work&#160;?
 cegprakash: PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER depends on situations
 yhyoxx: 1280
 cegprakash: oh yeah the range
 HoriMiyamura: I would say, this time we have too many legend
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: I will try that
 yhyoxx: look at the rules 
 yhyoxx: wind&#160;: All entities (except your own heroes) within 1280 units are pushed 2200 units in the direction from the spellcaster to x,y. 
 HoriMiyamura: we already have 211 legend till now, and we have more than 1 day left 
 cegprakash: we will have 300-400 by the time contest ends
 cegprakash: xD
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 cegprakash: more chatic legend 
 cegprakash: chaotic*
 cegprakash: it already is chaotic I barely climbed 10 ranks since my submit
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: climbed 50 ranks
 cegprakash: now we speaking xD
 yhyoxx: nice
 Whiskee: oh wow I went afk in gold (run completed) and came back to legend :eyes:
 Whiskee: thanks to whomever beat the boss and pushed it down
 cegprakash: it was a team effort Whiskee
 cegprakash: boss was 30.5 at one point
 cegprakash: we brought him down to 28.5ish
 Whiskee: I was actually consistently 3-0ing the boss without tuning against it at all
 Whiskee: but I'm very weak against double attackers
 Whiskee: that were popping up everywhere
 cegprakash: double attackers are bad at defense except for blasterpoard :P
 Whiskee: yeah I just didn't have great logic against it
 Whiskee: I focused on the most common meta
 blasterpoard: nope; my defense is bad as well
 cegprakash: u convert defence into attack xD
 nalka0: Double attackers are hard to def indeed
 cegprakash: Arnaud has stronger defence yes agree
 cegprakash: planning to switch to 2 defenders blasterpoard?
 cegprakash: that would be a lot of code change
 struct: I hate this game
 nalka0: 15-2 mon dernier submit pour l'instant :o
 nalka0: oops wrong channel x)
 nalka0: I meant my latest sumbit is 16-2 :p
 cegprakash: don't test too much against boss he just a wind user :P u need a generalized solution..
 cegprakash: boss is like last level of testing
 HoriMiyamura: do you guys know how to hanle 2 atts?
 cegprakash: atts?
 cegprakash: attackers?
 HoriMiyamura: attacker
 cegprakash: which leage are u in
 HoriMiyamura: still in gold
 Astrobytes: Listen to the wisdom of the ceg
 cegprakash: just wind them
 HoriMiyamura: I lost to 2 att a lot
 HoriMiyamura: but the monster right?
 HoriMiyamura: wind the monster?
 cegprakash: I have a global variable to kknow if I'm playing against 2 attacker
 HoriMiyamura: yeah
 cegprakash: in that case I have custom defence
 HoriMiyamura: then what to do?
 nalka0: I like how you say just wind'em but sometimes they shield themselves ya know?
 cegprakash: shielding 2 attackers are weaker they take too late to attack
 struct: Time for me to try 2 attackers I guess
 HoriMiyamura: do you have replay?
 struct: If it doesnt work I give up
 HoriMiyamura: to counter 2 atts?
 cegprakash: yes I'll give u replay
 HoriMiyamura: thanks
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629790289">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629790289</a> 
 cegprakash: DollarAkshay has a very very strong 2 attacker strat
 cegprakash: he snipes from long range with double wind
 cegprakash: actually triple wind
 cegprakash: wind followed by double wind
 cegprakash: and I defend against him
 cegprakash: it works in gold
 HoriMiyamura: thank you
 Astrobytes: stop exploiting your countrymen ceg! :P :D
 GalvaBart: @cegprakash thanks for sharing, that snipe was very surprising!
 HoriMiyamura: 2atts are quite a cheat
 HoriMiyamura: we have to treat them like this
 HoriMiyamura: haha
 cegprakash: sorry Astrobytes :P
 cegprakash: don't tell DollarAkshay
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: congrats on legend btw cegprakash
 cegprakash: ty Astrobytes
 cegprakash: going to add prune array next
 cegprakash: :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: excellent
 cegprakash: but I need some sleep now
 Astrobytes: no sleep til #1
 cegprakash: going to code non stop sleeping last 24 hours
 cegprakash: sleep 8 hours now
 cegprakash: and probably visit hospital after contest for backpain
 Astrobytes: I literally *live* backpain
 Astrobytes: get some sleep!
 struct: I dont know how to code these kind of bots
 struct: I might just try to plug a mcts to see if anything happens
 Astrobytes: are you hiding a secret search bot
 cegprakash: struct if else all the way
 struct: nope
 struct: Im just bad
 Astrobytes: said you in EVERY contest
 cegprakash: u came late if I remember struct
 cegprakash: had u come 2 days earlier u are legend by now
 Astrobytes: Personally, I don't care, gold is fine, I ain't bothered
 Astrobytes: he was here cegprakash
 struct: Fog kills me
 Astrobytes: I really don't like the game, it was a chore to motivate myself to reach gold tbh
 cegprakash: I kill monster from it's back while defending for better vision struct
 cegprakash: like 800 units extra vision
 Astrobytes: I'm just happy we had a contest tbh
 cegprakash: true
 cegprakash: it's been over an year
 cegprakash: and it's good to have something on vectors xD
 cegprakash: brings back Fantastic bits memories
 cegprakash: there we kick the ball here we kick monsters with wind and both are base defence
 cegprakash: and I ended up in gold in that.. so happy to do better this time
 Astrobytes: yeah, that part of the game I don't mind :D
 yhyoxx: i like vectors 
 cegprakash: I'll probably do code vs zombies after this contest
 cegprakash: I didn't pass the last test case
 Astrobytes: minus the fog and some different mechanics would have been better imo, but that's just mo
 cegprakash: hopefully after contest I could do it
 cegprakash: as both are kind of similar problems
 Astrobytes: except single player for CvZ
 Astrobytes: this game has a lot of codebusters in it
 Astrobytes: codebusters meets code royale meets fb, without the fun of fb
 Astrobytes: rec
 struct: At least this bot seems a bit better
 struct: First submit was rank 400 so I got demotivated
 Astrobytes: since I typed that I'll finish: recording guitar isn't that easy
 struct: hf
 Astrobytes: No I'm explaining my random 'rec'
 Astrobytes: Wrong damn window
 Astrobytes: where you at now struct?
 DomiKo:  some late coding here?
 struct: 20 gold
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: just saw it, looks good
 DomiKo: figting for legend?
 DomiKo: struct add some movement to your attacker
 Astrobytes: struct is, I don't give af
 DomiKo: I understand
 struct: I can i guess
 Astrobytes: no saltiness, got gold, can't be overly bothered :D
 struct: I just hate this game with some passion
 Astrobytes: completely forgot to get up for coedjam 1C this morning too
 DomiKo: me too
 Astrobytes: wooo codejame even, coedjam I might have got up for
 DomiKo: but I missed it on purpose
 Astrobytes: you already qualified
 DomiKo: nope
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: why?
 DomiKo: before 1B I had another contest
 DomiKo: before 1A I had exam
 DomiKo: and today I had HashCode
 DomiKo: no time for codejam&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: ah, 1A for me never was gonna work at that time in the morning. 1B was at like 5pm, I can't do that stuff at 5pm. So I was counting on 1C and totally forgot :D
 DomiKo: next time 
 DomiKo: maybe next time xd
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'll be more prepared
 Astrobytes: how was hashcode btw?
 DomiKo: it was suppperrr hard
 DomiKo: 24th for us
 witty3: there is no 1D, 1E
 DomiKo: 20 teams had like 0 points
 Astrobytes: wow
 DomiKo: we go 1MLN, and top1 got 5MLN points so...
 kovi: gratz domiko
 DomiKo: how about you kovi?
 Astrobytes: madness
 Astrobytes: yeah how did you do kovi?
 Astrobytes: or 'team kovi' shall I say :D
 kovi: was hard....barely made it
 kovi: 31th
 Astrobytes: *31st
 DomiKo: F was your's friend too 
 Astrobytes: well done
 Astrobytes: # + th is only for numbers &gt; 3
 Astrobytes: (Sorry, I coach euler on his English a bit so it's habitual to correct)
 DomiKo: Better to know that you are making a mistake
 Astrobytes: Agreed. I would expect it if trying to speak in another language.
 Kido-san: Anyone know what the trick is to get more wild mana? Heroes are away from base the whole time still getting around 578 wild mana..boss3 getting 614
 cegprakash: which league are u in Kido-san
 Astrobytes: try to attack him instead
 Kido-san: Bronze hehe (quite low)
 cegprakash: just don't go too far from ur base
 cegprakash: that should do in bronze
 cegprakash: and try to work as a team 
 Astrobytes: use wind, that should help
 cegprakash: I mean ur heroes should split farm
 Kido-san: Thanks..doing all that at the moment I think. Only losing as Boss3 keeps getting more wild mana
 cegprakash: can u share a replay
 cegprakash: can easily find what u are doing wrong
 cegprakash: with turn  number
 Kido-san: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629807738">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629807738</a>
 cegprakash: don't use wind in first 20 turns
 cegprakash: u are losing farm
 cegprakash: health of monsters increase by 1 every turn
 cegprakash: so it's pretty easy to kill the monsters in early game
 cegprakash: I mean health of monsters increase by 1 every 4 turns*
 Kido-san: Great tip!
 cegprakash: don't use wind for first 50 turns *
 cegprakash: u have to be as close to the monsters and farm more than pushing it away from u
 cegprakash: push it only when u feel u are in danger
 cegprakash: u are faster than the monster by 2x anyway
 Kido-san: Thanks cegprakash, super useful tips&#160;:-) will save mana and use it only if base gets surrounded
 cegprakash: say u spot the monster at 6000 distance monster has 20 turns to reach the base and u can do 40 damage in 20 turns
 cegprakash: just with 1 hero
 cegprakash: and if there are too many monsters then feel free to trigger the button
 cegprakash: blew em away
 Kido-san: :bow:
 Kido-san: That helped, now in silver league, thanks a lot
 HoriMiyamura: how to counter 3 def then?
 HoriMiyamura: are you still there cegprakash?
 Astrobytes: come on Hori, watch some replays and do some work
 HoriMiyamura: you are right, I only need the replay :D
 HoriMiyamura: too sleepy
 HoriMiyamura: just submit code, I hope I can be legend after sleep
 struct: 31 hours only
 struct:&#160;:&amp;
 HoriMiyamura: I think I am legend for this submit
 HoriMiyamura: can't sleep
 yhyoxx: contest ends at 7am&#160;?
 HoriMiyamura: 27% rank 29
 struct: I think 8am
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 struct: Its 31 hours and 50 minutes left
 HoriMiyamura: you 2 on same country?
 struct: nice HoriMiyamura
 struct: no
 struct: I dont think so
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 struct: This bot is a bit better than my previous but not by much
 struct: hmmm
 yhyoxx: thought it ended at 3pm
 yhyoxx: UTC +0
 HoriMiyamura: server run faster at this time
 HoriMiyamura: Almost go to Lenged last time
 HoriMiyamura: then push down by 2 atts
 HoriMiyamura: hope that this time I can success
 struct: gl
 HoriMiyamura: some strategy is quite flexible
 HoriMiyamura: they can 2 atts, then later 3 defs
 MrAnderson: Haven't done a contest in 6 years and almost didn't do this one, but I dusted off the ol' IDE this morning.  I'll be satisfied with almost anything, as rusty as I am

 HoriMiyamura: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629868536">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629868536</a> what is this strategy called?
 HoriMiyamura: the on from Eaglewind
 Zandy156: I wonder what the most wild mana win someone has gotten is?
 HoriMiyamura: I think there are a doc saying about maxium mana in map
 HoriMiyamura: but not so sure
 a-Rye: Sorry, not coding related, but important. "Please Mr. Putin, don't be a Carl." I expect talk shows in the US might be joking about this soon, but this is for world peace. I worry about a lot of you! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codepen.io/A-Rye719/full/NWXZdOg">https://codepen.io/A-Rye719/full/NWXZdOg</a> . Thank you, and continue to enjoy the wonderful Spring Contest!!!
 Tuo: LOL! i have been refactoring and improving code for 2 days straight to get legend! just about to finish and get auto promoted :dizzy_face:
 MrAnderson: congrats!
 struct: lets keep it coding related pls a rye
 HoriMiyamura: when will a replay got deleted? OR it would be saved forever?
 struct: rand()&#160;% time;
 struct: idk HoriMiyamura :p
 struct: Some say deletion time gets increaed after someone watches it
 HoriMiyamura: I just got to Lengend struct :D
 struct: Grats hori
 struct: 2 attackers or 1
 HoriMiyamura: your idea about shield is correct
 HoriMiyamura: I decrease the use of shield (still use it sometime) and my bot is much stronger
 struct: nice
 HoriMiyamura: next is top 20
 struct: gl
 struct: Try to watch top players to get ideas
 HoriMiyamura: just a question: if I play multiple account, is it valid?
 struct: no
 HoriMiyamura: I can disable the other code
 struct: yes sometimes people do that
 HoriMiyamura: I won't use all of them to get price if I have though
 struct: I would not have multiple accounts active on the leaderboard at the same time
 HoriMiyamura: just use multiple for the sake of make sure I won't need to resubmit a good solution
 struct: One thing is submiting with an account then break that bot and submit with the main account
 struct: Another thing is having multiple active bots
 HoriMiyamura: I now aim for top 20
 struct: Hori I would recommend against it, but I'm just a chat moderator
 struct: I would keep it to 1 account if possible
 HoriMiyamura: at the end of contest I will disable the others
 HoriMiyamura: ok, I got it.
 HoriMiyamura: other account still in gold
 Tuo: there is also plagiarism detection right?
 HoriMiyamura: so maybe I let them there
 struct: Yes Tuo
 struct: Leave them hori
 struct: because its also not fair if you play vs your own bots
 struct: It will impact final rank
 HoriMiyamura: ok, then
 struct: ty for understanding&#160;:)
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 struct: Long time ago they also offered shirts for rank 1 of each language
 struct: Some people would get legend and then submit with other language
 struct: They also checked that
 HoriMiyamura: well, I need to be in 20 first :D
 HoriMiyamura: hope I can do that
 HoriMiyamura: Do I need to disable other accounts?
 HoriMiyamura: or just submit some dummy things?
 struct: you can just submit a broken bot
 HoriMiyamura: thanks
 HoriMiyamura: this game is weird somehow
 HoriMiyamura: I call WIND on target because it is in range, but the target move and I miss it
 struct: Im still thinking if I hate this one more
 struct: or 2020 one
 struct: No
 HoriMiyamura: I don't hate any contest
 struct: That only happens if the target is a hero
 HoriMiyamura: at least this is much interest than ESCAPE
 HoriMiyamura: yeah, I am saying about hero
 HoriMiyamura: some time the hero can avoid the WIND
 struct: Yeah I still dont check if opp exists
 struct: So I dont have anything for that
 struct: :p
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 HoriMiyamura: I hope we don't see Fall2022 as Escape!!!
 Zandy156: yeah
 Zandy156: I'm enjoying this one even though it came at a bad time.
 struct: 7500 players so far
 struct: is not bad
 struct: previous one was 6,867
 HoriMiyamura: CG is more and more popular
 struct: I think 1 contest per 4 months would be the best
 HoriMiyamura: ..., it is fun but it will take time
 struct: At least I can still port board games and make AIs for it :D
 struct: Only thing I know how to make is average ais for board games
 HoriMiyamura: I don't know what is average ais 
 struct: not top 3
 struct: like top 10
 HoriMiyamura:&#160;:*
 struct: The difference is that there I dont need to use ifs
 struct: :p
 ASM_MOV_INT: what IF you did...?
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 HoriMiyamura: 2atts is quite powerfull with top players
 Zandy156: if you use a control spell on say id: -1, does it cost mana?
 HoriMiyamura: unlike those 2atts that only do 1 thing, top players 2atts is nice
 HoriMiyamura: so I would say normal 2atts is cheat, top player 2atts is interested
 HoriMiyamura: Zandy156 you can test on your idea, I think it is invalid and you'll lose
 stolyaroleh: gah, I wish the feedback loop was faster
 Zandy156: which top players 2atts do you think are interesting?
 HoriMiyamura: like blasterpoard
 HoriMiyamura: 2atts in lower legend and gold are just going to 1 point and WIND at the same time
 HoriMiyamura: nothing more, and it is so dum that they got high rank
 struct: ok I have an idea
 struct: Not sure if it will work
 struct: But if it does its massive
 HoriMiyamura: what is your idea?
 HoriMiyamura: it is for the contest?
 Zandy156: I felt like none of the bots when legend first opened were good. 
 HoriMiyamura: yeah, I agree
 HoriMiyamura: but the tops are now very good
 Zandy156: meaning they all had major weaknesses, just leaning on what you said
 struct: yes hori
 struct: I'll try it
 Zandy156: but recently some are getting better
 struct: might not work at all
 HoriMiyamura: The first lengends are pioneers
 HoriMiyamura: the latters aren't
 Zandy156: there sure were alot of different strategies 
 HoriMiyamura: bye guys, aim for top 20 after sleep :D
 struct: bye
 Tuo: oh no :worried:. early control is so strong and i put all eggs on 1 + 2 wind
 Tuo: that gets countered by single wind&#160;:(
 Tuo: it looks cool tho
 SkyDreamer: cant we use string var is .replace() parameters?
 SkyDreamer: python btw
 SkyDreamer: in*
 struct: It should
 struct: too bad this strategy doesnt work :p
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629936895">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629936895</a>
 Zandy156: maybe if they didn't just stand there 90% of the time :p
 Tuo: u need to gather some spider on the way there&#160;:)
 Tuo: like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629946102">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629946102</a>
 struct: nice
 struct: so you keep track of spiders that are out of fov?
 stolyaroleh: disgusting
 Tuo: no just send whatever happens to walk by :D
 Fallback: so in the game instructions, it says it updates hero move, hero melee and then creep move. So we should be able to move with 800 units of where the creep USED to be and get a hit on it right? I'm seeing a contradiction in the game where I'm not getting the hit
 stolyaroleh: I hate when boss 5 starts to spam wind
 stolyaroleh: just burns all my mana
 struct: What rank are you Tuo?
 struct: Fallback you move then attack everyhing in 800 range
 struct: then wind applies
 struct: then all spiders move
 struct: if they were not pushed by the wind
 Tuo: legend 240, but my strat doesnt really work in legend
 Tuo: well obv because bottom of league
 struct: Im going to try for 2 more hours
 struct: should be able to make it to legend
 struct: not that far
 Fallback: Take a look at this replay. The top blue hero should've scored a hit on frame 10 because his current position is within 800 of the spiders last position right? or am I missing something here
 Fallback: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/629940400">https://www.codingame.com/replay/629940400</a>
 struct: frame 10 to 11?
 struct: Hero 0 did it hit
 struct: Hero 1 didnt because it was still further than 800 before spider moved
 Fallback: I mean frame 9 to 10 and he does get a hit. I misread it, just a little tired and seeing things. sry, thx
 struct: np
 MAWAAW: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629954386">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/629954386</a>
 MAWAAW: at round 106 the mob 83 is bugged&#160;?
 struct: no
 struct: it hits the wall
 struct: If you draw a line from the spider position to where it should go after the wind it will intersect with the wall
 struct: and will keep the intersection position
 MAWAAW: it shoulgo at 17630,9000
 struct: The wind is based on your hero position
 struct: if you output 17630 hero_y it might have worked
 Zandy156: yeah if your hero blows to its own position, monsters get held in place
 struct: ofc this way is not perfec
 struct: I calculate spider angle to base I want to send it too
 struct: and use that instead
 Tuo: hero_pos + (target_pos - spiders_pos) 
 Tuo: solves this problem
 struct: So is angle not needed?
 Tuo: if u have vector math enabled&#160;:)
 stolyaroleh: damn, I reached the limit of plays per time period
 stolyaroleh: time to go to bed
 struct: gn stoly
 Tuo: struct no need for angles
 struct: oh ok
 struct: Im not good at math so I just used angles
 Zandy156: I'm finally writing some attacking code
 struct: Nice Zandy156
 struct: I wrote some too
 struct: are you going to do 1 or 2 attackers?
 Zandy156: I'm going to keep it simple since this is usually the point my bot falls apart
 struct: Yeah thats what I did at first
 struct: First I kept the defenders I had and then added 1 attacker
 struct: Until it did sometihng
 Zandy156: the plan is 2, but the simple strategy is to only switch them to offense for a quick attack
 Zandy156: first thing I did was sent 2 heroes out into the field and told them never to come back
 Zandy156: been training my solo defender ever since
 struct: I see
 DoraUst: Guys i'm so lost i panic everytime i see a code like idk how should i act and watch 1st (it's my 1st time on codingame)

 Miki09: Hi guys. I have 1D and 3H to get to legend. Lets code for a while...
 eulerscheZahl: 1D? 3H?are you playing chess?
 Miki09: 1 day 3 hours
 eulerscheZahl: oh. that makes more sense
 Miki09:&#160;:-)
 struct: Hi euler
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Royale also climbed to legend now. congrats if you read this
 eulerscheZahl: morning
 eulerscheZahl: large legend already
 struct: yeah
 struct: Lets hope I can get there soon
 struct: :p
 struct: Im gonna finish copying this guy strategy then Ill go to sleep
 eulerscheZahl: some stupid 3 attacker thing?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: shame on you
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: there are surprisingly few familiar names at the top
 eulerscheZahl: or at least none that you expect to be at the top close to the end
 struct: yeah
 yhyoxx: no beam search for you guys
 struct: But I dont think this contest appeals to everyone
 eulerscheZahl: sad, isn't it?
 struct: I guess none do
 struct: But I feel hate towards this game
 yhyoxx: because we're not learning much&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i bet blaster is going to win this
 struct: yhyoxx I enjoy writing the sim the most
 eulerscheZahl: or a surprise appearance of reCurse :P
 struct: on this game with fog is just pain
 yhyoxx: i have no idea how to sim or where to start
 struct: Not on this game thats for sure
 eulerscheZahl: really hard for this game
 yhyoxx: and im glad i can advance in this contest without knowledge i cant grasp in 1 week
 Miki09: where is reCurse?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a search based attacker. but discarded that bot again
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628489580">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628489580</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's a positive example. but also fails more often than not
 bolmos-o: Hello, I have a question: can we go back to gold league once we are in legendary league?
 struct: I enjoyed simulating the previous contest very much
 struct: But I also had 30+ days for it so
 yhyoxx: u wanna go back&#160;? x)
 eulerscheZahl: only go up in leagues, not down
 yhyoxx: we can exchange spots
 bolmos-o: I don't wanna go back, but I do want to test crazy stuff
 struct: You can still test it
 eulerscheZahl: legend is the bully league, no fun playing there
 yhyoxx: a second account&#160;?
 struct: no
 struct: Why not test on legend?
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd account might get you disqualified if they find out
 yhyoxx: make s sense
 Tuo: this contest is great, no fancy CS algorithms just old fashioned if/else
 Tuo: well at least my bot is :D
 HoriMiyamura: Heuristic is great in that even non-expert can code a good solution
 yhyoxx: euler&#160;:
 yhyoxx: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 HoriMiyamura: and believe me, if you are good at bot algorithm, you can create an excellent solution even the game is aim for heuristic
 HoriMiyamura: so in my opinion, this game is by great
 HoriMiyamura: I don't know why many of you dislike it
 HoriMiyamura: *don't understand
 struct: I give it 5/10
 Miki09: 4/10 hate 2 or 3 attackers
 HoriMiyamura: yeah the 2/3 atts is weird
 eulerscheZahl: wind stacking is too strong, that ruins it a bit for me
 struct: fog ruins it for me
 struct: Without fog I would have done a search
 struct: :D
 HoriMiyamura: fog is to aid the heuristic goal
 struct: ofc
 HoriMiyamura: this game is to help non-expert enjoy the game
 ItsNotABug: fog is fine, wind should average, not stack though
 HoriMiyamura: the 2/3 atts is the worst thing
 HoriMiyamura: yeah
 HoriMiyamura: I agree
 HoriMiyamura: if wind doesn't stack, 2/3 atts will quite balance
 ItsNotABug: No fog just means cpp people rinse with no hope for anyone else
 HoriMiyamura: yup
 struct: Never used cpp never will
 eulerscheZahl: that would be nice, wouldn't it?
 HoriMiyamura: the point is wind stacking is too powerfull
 Waffle3z: why doesn't wind simply blow the fog away
 HoriMiyamura: haha
 Miki09: That would be interesting
 struct: doesnt sound bad tbh
 struct: But by that time its game over anyways

 Kitkat260: hru
 MadKnight: gg Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this is just a bit of a challenge
 Godofdeath1: where are you from 
 RegalSSBU: your mom
 Godofdeath1: what???
 Godofdeath1: anyone from india
 noahcodesall: lolololololol
 Godofdeath1: anyone suggest which lang suit for fresher
 NeoCipher: Me I am from India
 NeoCipher: Damn same fresher here :joy:
 Kitkat260: hi
 NeoCipher: Hi
 Godofdeath1: in india,which state you are
 NeoCipher: Hyd
 Kitkat260: i´m ok
 Godofdeath1: do ypou have any idea what should i do after clg life..
 NeoCipher: You know that best dude and I am a fresher myself so no idea
 NeoCipher: The only question is do you like coding?
 Godofdeath1: :laughing:
 MeSeet: what's clg?
 NeoCipher: College
 Kitkat260: yep
 MeSeet: ahhh, ok
 Godofdeath1: of course i  like but its day by day getting tough
 MeSeet: wanna start easy as a hobby only? or wanna go for a job stuff?
 Godofdeath1: i am doing srm university at chennai
 NeoCipher: Yeah same but if you like it that's more than enough ig just don't loose interest and give up that's all
 Godofdeath1: same i am also would like to become a hubby for a girl.but job is commtment for life
 NeoCipher: Coding won't be easy forever that's why its fun and if it becomes easy learn a new ang
 NeoCipher: *lang
 Godofdeath1: of course  i agree,
 Godofdeath1: i had thought about entreprenur in my childhood
 NeoCipher: So do you still think about it?
 Godofdeath1: but later on job only need for family and life.so that ...
 MeSeet: you have the family already?
 NeoCipher: Yeah that's pretty much the case with everybody in India :joy:
 Godofdeath1: yeah i am thinking but i don't have much money to interest 
 Godofdeath1: invest
 NeoCipher: I think by family he means for the future
 NeoCipher: or his parents now
 Godofdeath1: exactly
 NeoCipher: Yeah I think along the same lines too
 NeoCipher: But I like coding too
 Godofdeath1: ii don't know why indian parents like that ,
 alphexus: turn what u love into a job
 Godofdeath1: i wiil do my best
 NeoCipher: So for now if you cannot do anything about investing do two things
 MeSeet: I love doing nothing alphexus, what do you recommend as a job?
 NeoCipher: Either gain knowledge about it so you are ready in the future
 NeoCipher: And just focus on college don't take a lot of pressure
 alphexus: Same, but yk what i meant lol
 alphexus: turn a hobby or passion u like into a job. 
 Godofdeath1: tnq for your advice:relieved:
 NeoCipher: No need for thankyou and all dude
 NeoCipher: we are the same age
 MeSeet: damn, cannot break below the rank 660-680 in clash of code... seems like I found my limit...
 NeoCipher: :joy:
 NeoCipher: Shitt my clach of code is going on
 NeoCipher: lol
 NicknameAlreadyTakenHelp: egg
 NeoCipher: cant do it now
 alphexus: personally, i like being self-employed
 NeoCipher: MeSeet I have gone below it  yayy
 Godofdeath1: everyone wants to become a hobby,after marriage they start thinking why i have chosen this life
 NeoCipher: but not below 500
 NeoCipher: :cry:
 Godofdeath1: the bull s*** happened only in india
 Godofdeath1: low salary
 NeoCipher: Yeah that is a issue so gotta study boii and take that package 
 NeoCipher: I like cs because the logic is simple if you are good you get good package 
 NeoCipher: else avg
 alphexus: i like cs because i can make cool things.
 Godofdeath1: average age of our life is 60 years.in that we have spend more  than 20 years only for study purpose.if we want more package we have to put all our energy for that . 
 MeSeet: I got no clue about cs, I just started coding a bit with Coding train on JS and then I found Codingame and I mostly do clash of code
 alphexus: not a fan of studying. i learn as i go and i learn from mistakes
 alphexus: the more projects you make, the more you learn
 NeoCipher: Same same
 NeoCipher: My grades are bad bcz of all the learning
 alphexus: if your cramming knowledge for the sake of it and not having fun, your only going to get so far. 
 NeoCipher: chem is the best ex of subject that just drags the grades down for me
 Godofdeath1: As a beginner what type of project we will try?
 alphexus: have some fun with what ur doing
 alphexus: theres tons. i recommend replicating simple games
 NeoCipher: I love doing Codin too it just eases my mind and I feel happy after it :laughing:
 MeSeet: my first project as beginner was solving the salesman problem with genetic algorithm, was quite nice&#160;:)
 alphexus: genetic algorithms are quite cool
 alphexus: mutations, and watching evolutions. oh so fun
 Kitkat260: ahhhhhh
 MeSeet: second was coding NEAT algorithm to solve double inversed pendulum problem
 MeSeet: since then I waste my time and life on clash of clans xD
 MeSeet: I love the shortest mode so much that I'm not even able to code correctly anymore
 NeoCipher: Wait all oh you are in 1st year
 NeoCipher: I hate shortest
 NeoCipher: I love reverse 
 NeoCipher: then fastest 
 NeoCipher: :joy:
 MeSeet: reverse is nice, shortest is wonderful
 MeSeet: aka how to write a code that is working but that you cannot understand 5 minutes after finishing writing it
 NeoCipher: Yeahhh :laughing:
 NeoCipher: I have learned a lot of tricks due to shortest
 NeoCipher: So many that now I amke notes of them
 NeoCipher: *make
 MeSeet: yeah, so many things to learn
 MeSeet: but code is so ugly
 NeoCipher: Yeah you try to cramp everything and make it as small :joy:
 MeSeet: you should try the code golf challenges
 alphexus: i hate code golf. 
 alphexus: i always lose to someone who tryhards ruby or something
 MeSeet: then you sort the leaderboard by language and you see where you are compared to your own language
 NeoCipher: Ruby is such a good lang for shortest
 alphexus: ikr
 MeSeet: my best score is on temperature (1208) but I'm still 11 char from the best JS player
 NeoCipher: I am first as of now in my shortest
 NeoCipher: but The guys who submit at last god damn they make it small 
 alphexus: 1208 chars in golf?? 
 MeSeet: position
 alphexus: ohh
 MeSeet: 67 char for temperature
 MeSeet: with JS
 Kitkat260: sup
 alphexus: @NeoCipher my actual account is sofiaaa, but my school blocks github and i cant login so im on this temporary account.
 JLukeSkywalker: set up a tor browser?
 alphexus: chromebook e.e
 alphexus: they block it
 JLukeSkywalker: you cant stick a portable tor browser on like a thumb drive?
 alphexus: never tried. 
 JLukeSkywalker: thats how i got around my HS internet stuff
 JLukeSkywalker: or just remoted into my home computer
 Switch64: wassup boys 
 alphexus: thanks. ill try doing that. 
 Kitkat260: hi @swich64
 Switch64: hi @Kitkat260 
 Kitkat260: hru
 Switch64: how a re you 
 Kitkat260: i´m ok
 Switch64: haha we sait it at the same time :joy:
 Kitkat260: lol
 Switch64: i'm ok btw
 alphexus: one question. how do i run an exe on a chromebook without developer mode?
 MadKnight: why do u even need that&#160;?
 alphexus: if i had dev mode i could install something like wine but i dont. 
 alphexus: im trying to run tor
 alphexus: a tor browser
 JLukeSkywalker: what exe are you trying to run
 MadKnight: isn't there tor build for linux&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: isnt there a mac version?
 MadKnight: or mac
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 Kitkat260: really
 alphexus: can chromebook run mac software?
 MadKnight: Kitkat260 where's your daily hi
 JLukeSkywalker: what os are you on?
 alphexus: chrome os
 Kitkat260: @MadKnight what do u mean?
 MadKnight: u been saying hi for so long, Kitkat260
 MadKnight: alphexus it's like linux ubuntu
 Kitkat260: yeah yeah yeah
 MadKnight: what bots are u working on right now Kitkat260&#160;?
 alphexus: whats the file extension to run if its for linux/ubuntu
 JLukeSkywalker: alphexus: i would say, not worth dicking with it, just remote into a home computer or something not on the school network
 Kitkat260: none
 alphexus: i would but they block a lot of stuff its hard to circumvent
 JLukeSkywalker: is this a HS or college?
 alphexus: hs
 JLukeSkywalker: can you just dual boot a linux distro?
 JLukeSkywalker: then put it back the way it was when you return it
 JLukeSkywalker: that would get around all the kiddy filters on the computer side, and you could easily bypass network stuff from there
 alphexus:  i need dev mode for it
 MadKnight: just use tails OS
 MadKnight: it uses tor network for all the connections
 JLukeSkywalker: and its small
 JLukeSkywalker: what is dev mode
 JLukeSkywalker: ah, is that like pswd protected or something?
 MadKnight: no, why?
 alphexus: its enforced by the school administrator
 alphexus: its like an option u cant turn off and restricts any settings they choose 
 JLukeSkywalker: so if you are offline, you cant enable dev mode?
 alphexus: i cant enable it without a factory reset.
 alphexus: but if i do that, ill get in trouble thats why
 alphexus: they have stuff like goguardian installed to check what we doing
 JLukeSkywalker: and this is why i was against school provided computers
 JLukeSkywalker: whats the point if you make it not a computer
 alphexus: i cant use my own even if i wanted to lol 
 alphexus: i found ways to circumvent GoGuardian 
 alphexus: which is just using a web proxy
 alphexus: but it has its restrictions
 JLukeSkywalker: can you boot from an external drive without dev mode?
 alphexus: nope
 JLukeSkywalker: i am not suggesting this, but I would totally factory reset the thing
 JLukeSkywalker: I also got banned from using school computers for 2 years in HS tho, so dont listen 100% to me
 JLukeSkywalker: finds way to get every families credit card info in the school district, reports it to the school board. Instead of fixing it, they try to get us in trouble
 JLukeSkywalker: still havnt fixed it like 7 years later
 JakubWicher: guys
 thezlodziej: how hard is getting job in it?
 thezlodziej: and also how satisfied are you with it?
 eulerscheZahl: there's always a legal solution that's easier to implement than the technical one
 jacek: oO
 Apyx121: site buggy?
 Kitkat260:&#160;????
 Denis_LT: is it just me or the site today experiences problems
 TaeGanchanapibon: this site does not route me to compete sometimes
 jacek: oO
 jacek: huh
 ProTon: I'm also having issues
 ProTon: I can't see when new players join, or when the clash starts
 ProTon: I have to refresh the page to see anything that changed
 HunterEhrenfeld: clashes arent starting
 ProTon: They are starting, just refresh the page
 ProTon: But you can sit there waiting without realizing the clash started if you don't refresh every few seconds
 Kitkat260: lol
 HunterEhrenfeld: so youre telling me im gonna get an L for all of these clashes lol
 ProTon: Seems like
 ProTon: Pretty annoying, isn't it
 Kitkat260: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't clash seems to be the best solution.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: webview crashes everyone's phone and people wonder why I won't use chrome... smh
 BlaiseEbuth: Who use chrome...
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG, discord, etc.... all being pushed towards chrome
 AntiSquid: oh chat is back
 eulerscheZahl: I do BlaiseEbuth (or more precisely: chromium)
 BlaiseEbuth: No it is not. Go away squid.
 JLukeSkywalker: isnt chrome like the worst browser at this point?
 BlaiseEbuth: chromium is not chrome
 eulerscheZahl: still no mod icon?
 HarshShekhar: waasssupp
 AntiSquid: hi HarshShekhar
 BlaiseEbuth: Only on chrome, I have it on ff ez
 HarshShekhar: Hi Anti
 eulerscheZahl: same engine, different wrapper around it. less sniffing and spying I hope
 HarshShekhar: Anyone else having issues on CoC today?
 eulerscheZahl: jacek reported it already
 jacek: :blush:
 JLukeSkywalker: nice, i got to the top of the fencing contribution
 eulerscheZahl: i still haven't looked into that&#160;:(
 JLukeSkywalker: looks like the people in 2nd/3rd found out that doing nothing wins vs most ppl
 JLukeSkywalker: my bot demolishes them&#160;:)
 jacek: just like real life
 eulerscheZahl: somehow dumping more shit on that pile of rotting contributions is more fun than cleaning it up
 jacek: youre gonna make clash contributions? :o
 eulerscheZahl: no, never!
 eulerscheZahl: just that dice game atm
 JLukeSkywalker: lol when i go to that page i always pick the puzzle filter
 JLukeSkywalker: just ignore the rest
 BlaiseEbuth: I prefer skewer people in real life...
 eulerscheZahl: wise decision, should be the default filter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: blockout in COC might help&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: CoC doesn't allow animations
 JLukeSkywalker: 100% text based
 JLukeSkywalker: u got dis
 BlaiseEbuth: Nor originality
 PatrickMcGinnisII: comlpleted by 4 people, frog has outdone himself
 eulerscheZahl: i think i have a visibility problem with my puzzles
 BlaiseEbuth: It's a toad.
 eulerscheZahl: only a few users will ever open them and then decide if they want to give it a try
 BlaiseEbuth: Same for my last one...
 eulerscheZahl: 500 puzzles on CG already. hard to stick out
 UnnamedCodinGamer: eulerscheZahl, which puzzles do you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6393284aa05cc93998d38204abccabe3afa3">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6393284aa05cc93998d38204abccabe3afa3</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, mean with what?
 BlaiseEbuth: Next one: heads or tails
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=eulerscheZahl&amp;category=ANY&amp;author=on">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=eulerscheZahl&amp;category=ANY&amp;author=on</a>whatever fits best to your question :D
 JLukeSkywalker: think he meant your puzzles specifically
 PatrickMcGinnisII: considering space maze, etc. the challenge is real
 UnnamedCodinGamer: of the approved ones, some are getting popular
 eulerscheZahl: in the optim category it's the easiest to attract players I think
 JLukeSkywalker: you pretty much are the optim category
 JLukeSkywalker: for user-made stuff
 eulerscheZahl: classic puzzles (especially for the harder categories): your puzzle is on a page with 100 other puzzles and only a few users even open that section
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: makes sense
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: optim page is still pretty empty =&gt; easier to be seen
 jacek: why theres no codegolf contributions&#160;:&lt;
 eulerscheZahl: ask julien
 BlaiseEbuth: There are :3
 JLukeSkywalker: bc they are all the same
 eulerscheZahl: CG Funge :D
 BlaiseEbuth: I meant coc ones ... :p
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Wontonimo: i'm not a fan of code golf, so i'm not complaining
 eulerscheZahl: ++
 BlaiseEbuth: But CG funge is one, sort of...
 Wontonimo: that CG Fudge one though .... oh that's a cool one
 BlaiseEbuth: I want you to see my puzzle&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/a-man-with-a-plan">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/a-man-with-a-plan</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: See it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm 0 contributor, so more power to you.  Maybe one of these days
 Wontonimo: for a puzzle i haven't started, it's eaten up lots of free thinking time
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it in pending blaise
 JLukeSkywalker: i saw it too, just not enough time lately
 JLukeSkywalker: does look really cool
 eulerscheZahl: and tomorrow the next topcoder marathon will start
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm on track for a tshirt so i don't want to miss it
 eulerscheZahl: 7 days for 1 optim game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I imagine what a CG-con would look like and it's scary AF
 eulerscheZahl: lots of animals?
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm in a lack of t-shirts... Perhaps I should register... :thinking:
 Kitkat260: u should
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder is complicated: there is a 3-month leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: so you can collect points (formula-1 style) in different rounds
 eulerscheZahl: current stage is fron january-march
 Therabidpanther: i want a t-shirt. plz help
 BlaiseEbuth: ... I'm gonna directly buy some t-shirts.
 Kitkat260: same
 Therabidpanther: may i have one
 eulerscheZahl: codejam qualification this weekend
 eulerscheZahl: they have 1000 tshirts for grabs
 BlaiseEbuth: Codejam, it's the google's one right&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/z81MDRw">https://ibb.co/z81MDRw</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: So no, thank you. I prefer when my t-shirts don't spy me.
 eulerscheZahl: understandable. I draw the line when it comes to facebook hackercup
 BlaiseEbuth: Two girls one hackercup...
 AntiSquid: does it say google on the codejam t-shirt&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or just codejam&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there's a google logo on the arm
 AntiSquid: ok
 AntiSquid: thx
 BlaiseEbuth: That's where the tracker is hidden.
 AntiSquid: RFID chip&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh codejam is doable, hasjcode is a bitch
 AntiSquid: hashcode is the one where they want you to have a team
 AntiSquid: kaggle featured one of the hashcode challenges on their website, or at least something related
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The Q round of codejam people can collab... hmmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 44k people tried to Qualify last year
 eulerscheZahl: codejam is the biggest coding contest I know of (the biggest existing?)
 BlaiseEbuth: Does it exist&#160;?
 Kitkat260: yea
 PatrickMcGinnisII: time limits look pretty high, ine test from last year says 40 seconds
 BlaiseEbuth: ezpz
 Kitkat260: crazy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top 50 got the pts required in under 9 hours
 BlaiseEbuth: Bots
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fairly doable
 BlaiseEbuth: After 9 hours I'll be considering to start reading the statement.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: round 3 , get a t-shirt ... so top 1k out of approx. 40k still seems doable
 eulerscheZahl: i tried 5 times, succeeded twice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: time drops to 2.5 hours
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh
 BlaiseEbuth: So you have 2 active trackers in your house...
 eulerscheZahl: and some from CG
 eulerscheZahl: and yandax
 eulerscheZahl: mail.ru

 PatrickMcGinnisII: how do trackers keep you from getting laid?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ;0
 oddoneout: what the hell is this conversation I've just tabbed into
 Kitkat260: hi patirck
 BlaiseEbuth: No trackers in the CG ones. But were your russian t-shirts worn by CBP agents at reception&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yandex algorithms, russian AI cup, some marathons hosted on codeforces
 BlaiseEbuth: RyRch -&gt; #clashs
 BlaiseEbuth: or #clash&#160;?

 RyRch: ohh my badd
 RyRch: sry
 AntiSquid: now you need to watch my video
 PatrickMcGinnisII: instead of notifications for accepted/refused...can i just get notified when a new puzzle goes live?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: only check the forum for new threads
 PatrickMcGinnisII: potw is arari go, hmm... should i bother
 jacek: ara ara
 BlaiseEbuth: war ir arari ro&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i runro shaggy
 eulerscheZahl: and all of the sudden i'm not sure anymore if we speak the same language
 jacek: was?
 AntiSquid: i didn't understand blaise either
 eulerscheZahl: jacek got tortured with German in school?
 BlaiseEbuth: I speak human! Solve a captcha to prove you're not all bots!
 jacek: :scream:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sounded like scooby-do to me
 AntiSquid: BlaiseEbuth, if Bill Gates says the vax is the mark of the beast, will you want to get it twice or more&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the movie, I Am Legend is set in 2021 and the xombies were ceated with a vaccine...just sayin'
 BlaiseEbuth: I am the one who say what is the mark of the beast, and if Bill say that he's a lier!
 AntiSquid: really? PatrickMcGinnisII
 BlaiseEbuth: Cancer vaccine
 BlaiseEbuth: Made from a modified virus
 AntiSquid: liar *
 BlaiseEbuth: Yourself!
 AntiSquid: mmm, actually this gen is different from others
 PatrickMcGinnisII: we are living the 'I am Legend' prequel
 BlaiseEbuth: That's pretty cool. The world gonna become more interesting...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's why we need starlink, so we can still CG
 BlaiseEbuth: Cg the day and zombies hunt party the night.
 AntiSquid: hey PatrickMcGinnisII i am trying to find info on the movie "I am legend", but google results only shows me unreliable "fact-checker" websites
 PatrickMcGinnisII: world goes to sh*t, nothing changes except for pizza delivery
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wikipedia
 BlaiseEbuth: Google don't trust you when you say "I am legend"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(film)</a>
 AntiSquid: ok wikipedia is moer reliable than those fact check websites, ya it says 2012
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, huh...hmmm I think 2021 is more fun to say
 AntiSquid: unbelievable, snopes actually admits biden fell up the stairs
 BlaiseEbuth: I've alreay read "The Zombie Survival Guide", I'm ready.
 AntiSquid: people who suffered from side effects act more like vegetables than zombies, so your survival guide won't help
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "How to make Zombie jerky"
 Gamak: Hey everyone
 Gamak: Can someone explain the meaning of a condition
 Gamak: if (!Number.isNaN(theNumber))
 Natanalel: it will return true if theNumber is a number
 Natanalel: anything else: string array... will return false
 boredStudent: Note that the most logical way might fail: after a=float("NaN"), a==float("NaN") will be false.
 issogood: you can't call it with Number.isNaN i don't think
 issogood: just isNaN(...)
 Minstriker: if (!)Not (isNan) False
 AdamSDK: whats wrong with clash of code

 AdamSDK: -_-
 Kitkat260: yea
 Kitkat260: :rage:
 creeperZnation4: Something's up with clash of code?
 idembele70: Yes i think too
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud reacted to the bug report with :eyes: already, so staff is on it
 DonnySte: Is it happening even to you to don't be able to join the clash?
 idembele70: No it's to began
 k2xl: page refresh buggered
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah it's terrible, I can't join a clash...
 idembele70: don't*

 DonnySte: I wanted to kick some ass on there&#160;:-(
 idembele70: :joy:
 AntiSquid: clash down? so this is a good opportunity to enjoy the parts of CG that matters!]#
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN i realized clash is featured on the quest map and that's why all the new people are obsessed with that thing&#160;:/
 AutomatonNN: :D
 AntiSquid: i like you, you actually listen and react accordingly
 oddoneout: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: AutomatonNN, do you think there is a way to ping euler&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a contest on Coders Strike Back since it takes 1000x simulations
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 eulerscheZahl: can i just ban it?
 BlaiseEbuth: :grin:
 AntiSquid: personally if the bot was annoying me as much as it annoys you, i'd buzz the owner first and give them short deadline to fix issue
 AntiSquid: then ban if they don't comply
 AntiSquid: and if there was an argument between us i'd ban the bot anyway after they fix it
 Z.e.a.l: hello guys when using google chrome codinggame website doesn't show me anything, only the top tabs are available and on firefox everything is working fine. So anyone can tell what's possibly be happening. 
 oddoneout: bots lives matter you bigots
 eulerscheZahl: that's an idea. on the other hand i'm less active now anyways so i'm not sure if it's worth bothering
 AntiSquid: it's a mostly non-spammy bot oddoneout
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a school case of over-specialization in neural network training.
 oddoneout: lmaooo
 AntiSquid: they could censor the bot from typing euler's name, imagine that having a name that's censored
 eulerscheZahl: while (message.contains("euler")) message = generateMessage()
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN euler
 AutomatonNN: what is the normal to the dog
 eulerscheZahl: *toad
 AntiSquid: hm was curious to see if it's rigged
 BlaiseEbuth: AutomatonNN is there a way&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: why did you like to be a newbie
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: AutomatonNN is there a way euler&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: why do you know what the problem with the first time you want to do?
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 <b>**AntiSquid kicks BlaiseEbuth and AutomatonNN&#160;: no spam!</b>
 AutomatonNN: when gives a little bit of something else
 NDPeshev19: k
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok recurse
 AntiSquid: woah there! i am not that strict .
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 AntiSquid: not as humourless either
 BlaiseEbuth: I agree on that point.
 KelvinAndHubbles: is clash of code fixed yet?
 KelvinAndHubbles: was being wacked earlier
 KelvinAndHubbles: usually do multiplayer and whatnot, but its just a sweet and short coding exercise
 JLukeSkywalker: i havnt had any issues with clash
 BlaiseEbuth: Clash are the issue.
 CALLmeANIKET: i faced many issue in compilers of java
 CALLmeANIKET: even i found out a remote code execution
 jacek: oO
 JLukeSkywalker: for python, can you use open to get in all inputs?
 eulerscheZahl: no, you have to use read() to get the content
 JLukeSkywalker: c,s=open(0)print(sum([i for i,j in enumerate(s) if j==c[0]]))
 JLukeSkywalker: somehow this guys code worked
 JLukeSkywalker: taking in a char then a string
 eulerscheZahl: golfers..
 JLukeSkywalker: mine was still shorter using input lol
 jacek: i want to see how he passed code review
 Astrobytes: good evening
 Astrobytes: I've spent almost a day trying to fix a bug in the completely wrong way. I feel like a massive arse.That is all.
 JLukeSkywalker: looks like if the file is multiple lines, python unpacks it by newlines directly from the open
 MrPapaya: yes, you'll get all the lines unpacked with open(0)
 JLukeSkywalker: it does have trailing newlines thoug
 MrPapaya: yes, all lines except the last one
 jacek: Astrobytes bt?
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 jacek: breakbytes
 Wilster: -=W=-
 AntiSquid: and you kept quiet not sharing your suffering&#160;? 
 thezlodziej: but how to win clash of code against python users when im using c++
 thezlodziej: impossible 
 thezlodziej: their character count is always gonna be better, no
 thezlodziej:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Why doing clash of code when you are smart enough to use C++&#160;?
 Denis_LT: wait how should i know if there will be length criteria in clash
 AntiSquid: easy solution to win with C++ vs python actually, stop playing clash, go play multiplayer bot where c++ has time advantage over python and python is slow, done @_@
 AntiSquid: thezlodziej
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 AntiSquid: Denis_LT you don't, clash is just introductory, get over it as soon as possible, move on to the better bits
 thezlodziej: I didnt even know this was a thing here I registered today
 thezlodziej: and clash is still fun
 AntiSquid: well see the URL / website title: coding game
 jacek: clash is life
 Denis_LT: clash is fun
 jacek: and clash mode is random
 thezlodziej: but i wish there was an option to select a language but then it'd probably take a lifetime to find a game
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN talk some sense into them
 AutomatonNN: why is there no way to get to bronze with a bot that gets promoted to silver with the same code?
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: makes sense
 Stoof246: i just learned
 Stoof246: that you can use print() in javascript
 Stoof246: my entire life is a lie
 AntiSquid: well depends what you're doing, what you need to output and how
 BlaiseEbuth: If you use js your life is also a mess...&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: also if you are doing JS you should be prepared to always discover new things, have to learn new things Stoof246 
 AntiSquid: Stoof246 ignore blaise, he is the stereotypical JS hater
 StarBoyG: anyone 1v1 any language imma show him some mad skills
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, always new bugs and inconsistency to discover in js...
 StarBoyG: java &gt; any language
 AntiSquid: omg 
 BlaiseEbuth: In execution time you mean StarBoyG&#160;?
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN what's wrong with people, first trash talk JS then put java on a pedestal? wtf&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code in the Code4life code in the meantime in the first test
 AntiSquid: nope not in chat
 StarBoyG: java is the primary language 
 StarBoyG: most popular primary lang
 jacek: kree java!
 AntiSquid: in hate received
 StarBoyG: viva la java
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll never put java on a pedestal. Excepted to be able to drop it.
 AntiSquid: lots of people turned down a job offer because it was mainly java
 Wilster: java the hut
 thezlodziej: but c++ is the best what are you talking about
 thezlodziej: im a masochist
 jacek: D plx
 AntiSquid: you can use D :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Use lisp.
 AntiSquid: D was meant to have the speed of C++ but the syntax of a scripted language
 Wilster: combine java and c++ with J++
 jacek: :scream:
 AntiSquid: Kotlin and C# are both better alternatives to java
 Wontonimo: all you people who use languages to mask the real problem... real programmers use PLA
 Wontonimo: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Not better. Less worst
 Wontonimo: there is no better alternative to java when your client demands the solution be written in java.
 AntiSquid: can you do PLA with an NN&#160;?
 StarBoyG: +1
 Laurinchen: How do I overload Operators in Java?
 AntiSquid: the client can go find another company
 Wontonimo: lol
 thezlodziej: but operator overloading is trash tbh
 thezlodziej: its better to just write a function to compare 2 things, no?
 StarBoyG: operator overloading is bs 
 AntiSquid: when does a company switch their main language because client wants specific language? they could do 2 projects or more in the amount it takes to switch and do something in a new language
 AntiSquid: amount of time *
 Laurinchen: "there is no better alternative to java when your client demands the solution be written in java."
 jacek:&#160;:?
 thezlodziej: write it in redstone
 Wontonimo: i hope everyone saw it as a joke.  I'm not java lover.  i was, i'll admit that.  each lang has it's special place
 Laurinchen: Write it with dominos (Yes there are domino computers)
 AntiSquid: except for java, vb.net and some others Wontonimo
 AntiSquid: i used vb.net though 
 Wontonimo: i hate objectiveC.  really, and unreasonably
 StarBoyG: im creating my own language
 Wontonimo: just what everyone needs
 StarBoyG: I will let u know when i publish it 
 Wontonimo: why would you?
 AntiSquid: let me know when it's top 10 in popularity
 AntiSquid: otherwise don't care
 StarBoyG: xD
 Wontonimo: i mean, won't it be the buzz everywhere such that informing me will be redundnat
 AntiSquid: Wontonimo you don't easily get the chance to meet the creator of a popular language so if he makes it far ...
 Wontonimo: hundreds of new languages are made every year.  most die without anyone other than the creator and their mother or pet lizard knowning about them
 AntiSquid: yes, but StarBoyG is special, he has potential, i can see it in his username
 StarBoyG: if some of you want to be part of my successful story dm me
 StarBoyG: everyone back then laughed at Mark
 StarBoyG: when he invited their friends
 AntiSquid: once it's a success dm me, then i dm back, promise, don't want to be part of a failed project
 AntiSquid: i am not laughing StarBoyG, i am waiting for a better time to accept your offer
 AntiSquid: did you start yet StarBoyG&#160;?
 Wontonimo: all joking aside (it's fun for sure!), the *process* of writing a new language could really help your understnading of programming
 Wontonimo: but other than that, it's a fools errand 
 Laurinchen: I hope it's a esoteric programming language
 Wontonimo: by default it is
 StarBoyG: Im bringing something new to the table
 Wontonimo: what's the programming lang that is just special characters?
 StarBoyG: new features easier syntax less code 
 AntiSquid: ya well do it first .
 StarBoyG: already in progress :D
 Wontonimo: libraries, support, user community, adoption, stability, interpretability 
 StarBoyG: you may laugh at the name now
 StarBoyG: but once u gonna talk how StarBoy talked to u
 Laurinchen: Make your language compatible with punchcards
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 AntiSquid: you didn't answer my earlier question on using NN for PLA Wontonimo, found this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/968880.969246">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/968880.969246</a>
 StarBoyG: this new language will have hologram 
 jacek: PLA?
 AntiSquid: 7D&#160;? StarBoyG #
 Wontonimo: that's so cool AntiSquid&#160;!
 Wontonimo: Progammable Logic Arrays
 AntiSquid: prgramming logic array jacek
 StarBoyG: dude didnt even opened the link and he said its cool lol
 jacek: NN is just matrixes. those are easily parallelizable
 AntiSquid: BUT is it popular&#160;?
 StarBoyG: im trying to program right now a covid test through finger print
 Wontonimo: oh, that paper is pre-alexnet&#160;!  cool.  Definitely a good candidate tech after training is completed
 StarBoyG: but I always come to half way and then got bored..and quit
 Wontonimo: well, that's not a good sign for someone who wants to write a new lang
 AntiSquid: halfway&#160;? so you have a ready product but are too bored to do the advertising and sell it StarBoyG&#160;?
 StarBoyG: im not good at marketing
 StarBoyG: I code for money not because I love coding
 StarBoyG: someone gonna code 24/7 cuz he loves coding (he lies) and I will code 24/7 too but cuz I love money 
 Wontonimo: i love coding.  started before i even knew there was such a thing as a job doing it
 Wontonimo: vic20 ... oh that tap drive
 StarBoyG: well it's interesting once u start doing it and when u finally realise what are u doing it brings u joy
 StarBoyG: anyway black hat hacker &gt; white hat hacker
 AntiSquid: oh my
 StarBoyG: what dude
 AntiSquid: you're so edgy
 StarBoyG: say, u always have something smart to say
 AntiSquid: i'm moved
 StarBoyG: I bet u r the smartest man wherever u go
 AntiSquid: not always
 AntiSquid: was that sarcasm? quite good if it was
 StarBoyG: nope that was irony :D
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 <b>**Wontonimo day 2 of 14 of working on SC2020 - did nothing&#160;:(</b>
 jacek: starcraft2020 eh
 Wontonimo: geez, i wish
 Wontonimo: that would be a cool bot challenge 
 Wontonimo: actually ... no.  i'd rather another physics based competition
 AntiSquid: why don't you then&#160;? need links to the starcraft contests? i think i have them all
 Wontonimo: when I said "i wish" ... it was an incomplete sentence that goes like tthis "i wish I had 100 hrs in a day and motivation to see that through"
 Wontonimo: i've gotta be realistic about my time and interest
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid - i just searched for starcraft bot battles.  cool stuff.  should have known about it already considering i followed AlphaStar
 peteje: f
 AntiSquid: oh god ... so i do need to redo this mess all over again ... fk it ... next time 
 AntiSquid: trying new game then @_@
 jacek:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: overengineered to the point of no return
 AntiSquid: i would like to say i overshot my goal, not that i didn't achieve it, it's CG having an obnoxious time limit, that's all

 AntiSquid: wtf is up with first link anyway lol
 AntiSquid: here's another one not sure if this is the one you found <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sscaitournament.com/">https://sscaitournament.com/</a>
 AntiSquid: there's about 2 more, didn't save the links it seems
 Astrobytes: inoryy and hjax are good to talk to re. SC agents
 AntiSquid: inorry and ajax play the aiarena.net version, not sure they play the other ones too
 AntiSquid: actually best to join that discord on the website and ask for help there :P
 Astrobytes: I think they're both mods on the SC AI discord
 Astrobytes: iirc
 AntiSquid: sc2 ai 
 jacek: so i should start trolling there too?
 AntiSquid: deepmind role, not od role @ Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: mod *
 AntiSquid: sure you have the discord link on aiarena
 Wontonimo: thanks AntiSquid, i didn't see those links.  
 Astrobytes: they *were* both mods
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/5JLFhh9">https://imgur.com/a/5JLFhh9</a>
 AntiSquid: they refurbished roles i think
 Wontonimo: later botters 
 AntiSquid: Wontonimo i find it weird i don't see you on any ML discord servers where i am anyway :P
 AntiSquid: bywe
 Wontonimo: oh. .. wait, like where?
 Wontonimo: hmm ... better for DM
 jacek: DM?
 Astrobytes: He wants him to be Dungeon Master obviously jacek...
 AntiSquid: why DM? here's a popular one&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/wNUX5Nq9">https://discord.gg/wNUX5Nq9</a>
 AntiSquid: found inorry on there :P
 Astrobytes: Is it any good?
 AntiSquid: got more, but really depends onw hat you look for so no point spamming links
 AntiSquid: i think they all can be good, well the ones i found anyway, so ya that one is good, some people were moaning "quality decreased when popularity increased"
 Wontonimo: cool, thanks
 Wontonimo: alright, ciao
 Astrobytes: later Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: I lurk mostly anyway AntiSquid so should be fine :P
 StarBoyG: how tf is this world chat if I keep seeing 4 same guys
 Zach_Attakk: Depends who's talking I guess
 StarBoyG: and how to change server 
 derjack: :thinking:
 StarBoyG: derjack
 StarBoyG: why u using pony
 StarBoyG: as ur profile pic
 StarBoyG: it's a bit autistic 
 Zach_Attakk: @StarBoyG type /help for commands
 derjack: i like ponies

 Astrobytes: There's a discord
 StarBoyG: naah
 derjack: you can do /join #ru  for example
 StarBoyG: im not really a big lover of talking with strangers
 Astrobytes: You want another language?
 StarBoyG: ok is this eu server?
 Astrobytes: This is world
 Astrobytes: Mostly EU
 StarBoyG: world but dude only you and antisquid talking
 StarBoyG: and derjack
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's not that busy outside contests unless we all have something we're working on
 StarBoyG: interesting 
 Astrobytes: (ie. the same optim or multi)
 Astrobytes: We try to keep it alive though
 StarBoyG: yea without u this would be nothing
 derjack: start coding for multi and talk about it
 Astrobytes: Also, plenty people don't bother chatting and just do multis or whatever
 StarBoyG: yea I do but I heard someone told me
 StarBoyG: there are some bots on multi
 Astrobytes: Clash has bots to fill the space if there are no human players.
 StarBoyG: ooh yea now I see 
 Astrobytes: Multiplayer bot programming - well, it says it right there
 StarBoyG: are  u bot too?
 Astrobytes: Aye, HaggisBot1746 they call mer
 Astrobytes: *me
 Astrobytes: You're familiar with this?:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 StarBoyG: well yeah but im struggling so,,
 StarBoyG: ..
 StarBoyG: I heard of this platform couple days ago
 Astrobytes: Struggling is good
 StarBoyG: so im learning im junior..
 AntiSquid: well i am not always here, so cherish the moments you see me spamming the chat StarBoyG
 AntiSquid: there are other people, but clashers are usually quiet, you're an oddity 
 Astrobytes: Stay away from clashes for now, do puzzles, go to bot programming/optim after if you like that
 AntiSquid: world chat is mostly used by the 5%
 StarBoyG: I don't have anything against any of u talking I just asked I was curious
 Laurinchen: I use it to spread operator-overloading propaganda
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes i think it's the quest map to blame, reason why everyone jumps on clashes&#160;:/
 StarBoyG: lol Lauri
 AntiSquid: Laurinchen then get a suitable avatar for that to do it more efficiently, just advice
 Astrobytes: tbh they jumped on them before, but yeah, it's changed things a little
 AntiSquid: i think before there more CSB-ers
 firestormninja1: is bitwolf a bot?
 firestormninja1: or a real player?
 Astrobytes: Yes, this is true AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: A bot iirc firestormninja1
 firestormninja1: thought so
 jacek: sounds furrious
 AntiSquid: atm they might just rename to codinclash&#160;:/
 StarBoyG: I hate people who refuse to share their code at the end of clash..
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, I believe bitwolf was a bot.
 Astrobytes: See this post firestormninja1:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash</a>
 AbundantPuddle: If you click on their profile it should tell you.
 AntiSquid: ah there's a lurker, the abundant puddle, StarBoyG not everyone chats
 Astrobytes: Ah, the PlentifulPool has returned
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao. What's up guys?
 firestormninja1: oh wow
 firestormninja1: that makes sense
 Laurinchen: ok got a profile pic to spread my operator overloading propaganda more efficiently
 Laurinchen: if it updates, of course
 Astrobytes: Not much AbundantPuddle, you?
 StarBoyG: wow its more like u spreading autism :D
 Kitkat260: really
 Astrobytes: Don't be rude StarBoyG
 StarBoyG: just my opinion 
 Kitkat260: agree
 mikosovsky: Hello guys
 Laurinchen: It's fine, I'm used to the fact that I'm not really a likeable person, nothing special
 StarBoyG: u r the real definition of hardcore developer :D
 Kitkat260: lol
 AbundantPuddle: Was playing around with the "Night of War" contribution by jrke. It's pretty cool. I gave up on the flower beds problem for a while. Can't pass validators 1 and 4 for some reason.
 Astrobytes: Oh, Night of War still needs testing, I forgot about that&#160;:/
 Laurinchen: U guys think "multiplayer/bot/Great escape" is a good puzzle to get into bronze league?
 Kitkat260: guys help
 Astrobytes: Laurinchen: Most of the bot programming games are easy enough to get into Bronze tbh
 jacek: without operator overloading though
 AntiSquid: hey Laurinchen there's a codingame channel with some tutorials on youtube
 HungryBurger: I'd agree, pick a challenge you're curious about, those will be easier for you.
 Astrobytes: Operator overloading is like *insert your vice here* - everything in moderation.
 AbundantPuddle: Kitkat260, what do you need help with?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6woCHjGCBXqpf91SsAcoQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6woCHjGCBXqpf91SsAcoQ</a> Laurinchen
 Laurinchen: Does it suggest some games for beginners?
 Kitkat260: starboy is acting werid to me
 StarBoyG: what the f
 AntiSquid: oh a yugioh play, have you tried Legends of Code and Magic yet&#160;? HungryBurger
 AntiSquid: player *
 Laurinchen: starboy may be wird but starboyG is ok
 Astrobytes: Laurinchen: How beginner is beginner in your case?
 Kitkat260: ok
 AntiSquid: no it doesn't suggest any games ... but imo it depends more on what you like and what you can do
 HungryBurger: I've been meaning to get back into LoCM. I liked that one for not being a grid-based game.&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: everyone recommends coders strike back for beginners, but it wasn't my thing and i wish i had done something else instead Laurinchen
 Astrobytes: meh, afk for a bit, back soon
 Astrobytes: oh, hi HungryBurger
 HungryBurger: Yeah, CSB was my first, and I found I really don't like phyics and trigonoetry.
 AntiSquid: i like grid games, hate the physics ones or the ones that make you check the referee a lot .
 HungryBurger: I saw one bot challenge involving a hex grid... I'm on the fence, since I don't know if it'll be easy to convert my grid-code to a hex-grid code, or if it's a trap.
 Laurinchen: Wait another guy who had problems with csb?
 HungryBurger: Hey there, Astrobytes.
 AntiSquid: try redblobgames i guess for penguins, i've done something entirely different though for my board :P
 AntiSquid: not that i had problems, more like didn't like it, but a certain mad knight pushed me to get legend, probably easiest legend, but least enjoyable#
 HungryBurger: Laurinchen - watch the demo of a couple of bot games, and see if you can visualize it.
 HungryBurger: The easiest bot challenge will be the one you can best visualize, which is unique to you.&#160;:-)
 Laurinchen: ok
 Laurinchen: makes sense
 StarBoyG: damn I think I got covid..
 Laurinchen: F
 StarBoyG: im not sure if I can talk because  I might be positive
 VioSaotome: was that a joke?
 <b>**StarBoyG slaps Laurinchen  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: Quit the crap talk.
 StarBoyG: no fr it might be just some classic virus
 StarBoyG: astro why u mad
 StarBoyG: too much coding?
 StarBoyG: take a break :D
 StarBoyG: nothing is made overnight 
 Astrobytes: Mad? I'm far from that
 AntiSquid: you're a bit erratic StarBoyG, i mean i get it you want to have some fun and joke, but not everyone can follow along with your mood all the time just saying
 StarBoyG: so u wanna say u guys have mood swings
 AntiSquid: was talking about you lol
 StarBoyG: I have one app for that
 AntiSquid: mood swing calendar&#160;?
 StarBoyG: I dont know maybe someone is on their period 
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: we were thinking the same thing
 Astrobytes: That would be an interesting development for me that's for sure.
 AbundantPuddle: 🥳
 AntiSquid: but anyway, you need to tone it down, not everyone gets your jokes StarBoyG
 StarBoyG: yea there r two types of  developers: 
 StarBoyG: creative and the one u draw him what to do and he does it :D
 StarBoyG: black-white minded people
 AbundantPuddle: Is StartBoyG a 🤖?
 Astrobytes: Since nothing is black and white does that not become a fallacious statement?
 HungryBurger: Yes, StarBoyG, please slow down, and consider whether what you say could be considered sexist or able-ist.
 StarBoyG: it's a metaphore 
 AntiSquid: AbundantPuddle no, why is it the Automaton2000 AutomatonNN like replies&#160;?
 Automaton2000: in what language are you using?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code and start your starter before you can complete the code
 Astrobytes: A metaphor for what?
 StarBoyG: tight coupling vs loose coupling :D
 Astrobytes: If you mean the black-white thing, then yes of course. But there is neither, only shades of grey
 AbundantPuddle: Yes AntiSquid. Just the randomness of their statements overall.
 AbundantPuddle: They may be the first human to fail the Turing test.
 Astrobytes: AbundantPuddle: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: now that's still a starg level joke, just a bit more round-about
 AntiSquid: he's being more direct and doesn't seem to understand restraint 
 StarBoyG: dude we all strangers 
 AntiSquid: nah, you're cool StarBoyG, no worries, just observe the social norm around strangers you encounter for the first time
 StarBoyG: everything I say is related to programming 
 StarBoyG: if u r not good in real life then u r not good programmer too
 Astrobytes: You could articulate your points in a less exclusive way
 AntiSquid: didn't you say black hats were better than white hats&#160;? StarBoyG
 StarBoyG: true
 StarBoyG: I did
 AbundantPuddle: I don't think saying someone might be on their period really relates to programming but okay.
 Astrobytes: ^
 HungryBurger: ^
 StarBoyG: ^
 AntiSquid: ^
 StarBoyG: I know antisquid got little smile on face
 StarBoyG: when he read that lol
 AntiSquid: it's a joke, it wasn't addressing anyone
 therealbeef: it's sexist
 AntiSquid: but you called the other guy autist earlier StarBoyG, that's too direct
 Astrobytes: Honestly, some of you just act like pubescent angry kids 
 AbundantPuddle: Not that I have anything against you personally or that statement. It's just if I were to venture a guess, I'd say you were probably a youngling looking to code and socialize, and we're thrilled to have you here. It's just we usually try to avoid, for lack of a better word, "immature" talk.
 Astrobytes: AbundantPuddle is correct. Some others facilitate this kind of thing
 StarBoyG: world chat is anyway dead 
 HungryBurger: Please understand that by using a phrase attributing someone/something as "autistic", you're speaking negatively of an entire group of people. Whether you intended it or not.
 Astrobytes: Same goes for 'on their period'
 AntiSquid: chat is too cereal
 StarBoyG: There are some autistic people who are above average intelligent
 StarBoyG: I don't know ya all too soft
 Astrobytes: Wtf happened to common decency and decorum?
 AbundantPuddle: Nobody said they were below intelligent?
 StarBoyG: im back to my programming enjoy
 AntiSquid: western society is softer when it comes to jokes and you are way too direct, even for an east european 
 StarBoyG: So u want me to pack ugly gift in nice box and send it to u :D
 AntiSquid: idk, what is the gift
 StarBoyG: joke :D
 AntiSquid: you know i can return the package
 StarBoyG: I might send it from fake address 
 Astrobytes: Softer when it comes to jokes? Hell no. But certainly not in a public forum where it might actually hurt someone, other than in jest in a private situation where it *could* be just a laugh.
 AntiSquid: well you are all overreacting at the period joke
 StarBoyG: 21st century u can see on billboards sexist jokes and what else not..
 AbundantPuddle: Basically there's a time and a place for everything. If you were in a professional working atmosphere, would you be saying the same things that you are stating in chat?
 Astrobytes: No AntiSquid you singled out the period one
 AntiSquid: he wasn't being sexist or singling out women, he was implying some guys have period 
 StarBoyG: nice antisquid
 AntiSquid: the spreading autism part was very rude
 AbundantPuddle: He was using perios as a synonym for being moody.
 AbundantPuddle: period*
 StarBoyG: exactly
 AntiSquid: StarBoyG you at least realize where you are overdoing it yes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: AbundantPuddle I get that, HOWEVER, it's not appropriate
 StarBoyG: sorry it wont happen again 
 AbundantPuddle: No, I 100% agree with you Astrobytes. I was responding to AntiSquid.
 Astrobytes: OK, sorry
 StarBoyG: I was just so happy my program successfully executed at first run
 AntiSquid: and what else do you need to say&#160;? StarBoyG
 StarBoyG: read above :D
 Astrobytes: Look guys and girls, we're in the 21st century here - not the mid 1900s, can we just have some respect and restraint?
 Rayito: any tips for new people?
 AntiSquid: and you had to toss a turd in chat out of excitement each time you were successful? StarBoyG
 AbundantPuddle: But anyways, again, I'm not really offended by anything he said, but it would be beneficial for him to be a bit more thoughtful before saying some of the things he said.
 AntiSquid: well Rayito depends what you want to do 
 idembele70: Never Give up Rayito 
 StarBoyG: Rayito im new too just develop ur skills by doing tasks
 idembele70: the begining is to HARD
 StarBoyG: google and ask for help I will always try to help u
 AbundantPuddle: Rayito, do you have any experience in any languages?
 Astrobytes: Same AbundantPuddle, I wasn't offended at all, but it kinda breaches our community guidelines and it's not the kind of thing to say in a public forum such as this
 AntiSquid: i hear women joke about period and i don't see any issue with that, we are getting into dangerous cancel culture / woke mentality territory&#160;:/
 StarBoyG: womens are more sexists than man
 StarBoyG: so..
 StarBoyG: what we talking about
 AntiSquid: depends
 StarBoyG: whats even more funny 
 StarBoyG: all of us here using a lot of bad words daily..
 StarBoyG: its something normal..
 AntiSquid: not really
 AbundantPuddle: I agree Astro.
 AntiSquid: you jump the gun easily and you don't realize it because you live within a different culture from these people here
 StarBoyG: u from UK
 Astrobytes: Any more sweeping generalisations before I leave you to your pit of misogynistic, backwards-thinking rhetoric?
 StarBoyG: those are some real words
 AntiSquid: you can hear rude lines anywhere, but i think even chavs know more restraint
 Logical_interactions_only: my oh my whats going on here? calm down&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: Believe me, I hate cancel culture, I don't really get offended easily, but I also know to respect people.
 StarBoyG: do u treat the poor same u treat the rich puddle?
 Astrobytes: Cancel culture is a way of ignoring problems without solving them
 AntiSquid: you just toss out anything that crosses your mind, know your audience, the hell, you're not listening StarBoyG
 AbundantPuddle: I treat everybody on a case by case basis and try not to generalize an entire group of people because everyone is different.
 AntiSquid: the period joke wasn't mysoginistic .
 AntiSquid: generalizing women that they are more sexist than men, was actually ...
 StarBoyG: it was a fact
 AntiSquid: no it's not
 StarBoyG: whaaaat
 AbundantPuddle: You can have a nice, rich person; a bad, poor person; a nice, poor person; and a bad, rich person. Their financials do not make them.
 StarBoyG: nice puddle
 AntiSquid: StarBoyG ever heard that all men are such and such&#160;? just google a bit what for example some feminists say, they generalize men like you generalize women
 StarBoyG: if u talk with women about programming
 StarBoyG: then..
 AbundantPuddle: uh-oh
 Astrobytes: Anyway, bye. I have enough going on right now without attempting to moderate this bullshit
 StarBoyG: met too I gtg
 Scarfield: gn
 AbundantPuddle: Take it easy Astro
 StarBoyG: sleep well astro :D
 StarBoyG: xD
 AntiSquid: StarBoyG don't be an ass . Women can code too . Now you're heading towards one of the dangerous extremes in society, unless you're already there .
 StarBoyG: women can code?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: good night
 StarBoyG: I never said that they cant
 AbundantPuddle: Part of me thinks that they're intentionally trolling.
 StarBoyG: but their skill are ridiculous compared to mans however I dont like to talk here about women-man thigngs
 StarBoyG: things*
 AntiSquid: that's fine
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think everyone can learn to code
 StarBoyG: bravo
 StarBoyG: even kids 
 StarBoyG: its just syntax rules..
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the difference is if you have interest in it or not
 StarBoyG: a bit of algorithms and daily practicing
 AbundantPuddle: Have you ever heard of Ada Lovelace?
 AntiSquid: i did and i've read multiple views regarding her story
 StarBoyG: I just googled it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: most women are genuinely not interested 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: or interested for career, which is not the same
 AntiSquid: she had potential, but she never had the chance to develop them to the fullest so we don't know how far she could have really gotten, on the other hand i think she might be overhyped and get more credit than she is due ... AbundantPuddle
 AntiSquid: the issue was for a long time women were discriminated in education
 StarBoyG: brarvo
 StarBoyG: bravo antisquid
 StarBoyG: damn
 StarBoyG: dude spitting fire
 StarBoyG: the same story goes with Hedy Lamarr
 AbundantPuddle: My point was she was a female and she is regarded as one of the first computer programmers.
 AntiSquid: did you read what i wrote? :D i get the feeling you just agree with me on a sentimental level, not based on facts lol
 AntiSquid: @starg 
 StarBoyG: I agree with u only  beacuse if astro kicks me so u can bring me back :D
 StarBoyG: lol
 AntiSquid: i can't bring you back
 AntiSquid: for kick you refresh the page, for bans you're fked live with it, complain to CG and then based on their interpretation you might get unbanned, which is imo unlikely 
 AntiSquid: in your case
 StarBoyG: when they ban u 
 StarBoyG: they ban ur ip address?
 AntiSquid: no chat mods only ban you from chat
 StarBoyG: permanently?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: we can't undo it
 StarBoyG: so different acount ..
 StarBoyG: make new acc and there u go
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: AbundantPuddle i think, based on what I have read about her, that there was a missed opportunity in her case, how much of what is said about her is hype and how much is fact? Not trying to discredit her, since he overcame a huge barrier.
 AntiSquid: she *
 therealbeef: until the late 70s the majority of programmers were women; men made the hardware. companies usually recruited programmers from other disciplines within the company. it only started changing when they introduced degrees in computer science. students in CS were mostly male so within a decade they formed the majority of the workforce. but no gender is inherently 'better' at programming
 StarBoyG: mens are better at logic
 StarBoyG: and programming takes a lot of time
 AntiSquid: a lot to do with nurture too
 StarBoyG: I wish Nikola Tesla programmed lol
 UnnamedCodinGamer: StarBoyG, you said it right - learn algorithms and practice 
 StarBoyG: yup it's language like English or any other learn syntax rules and there u go
 UnnamedCodinGamer: no
 UnnamedCodinGamer: languages are irrelevant
 UnnamedCodinGamer: algorithms are not
 StarBoyG: well yea thats true
 StarBoyG: but every programming language haves syntax..
 UnnamedCodinGamer: everybody can learn it
 StarBoyG: facts
 UnnamedCodinGamer: algorithms is where its at
 therealbeef: ah, shaved 14 pts off my search race score&#160;:-) finally. time to sleep
 AntiSquid: gn8
 AntiSquid: 14pts only&#160;? i know the pain ... need to redo 
 AntiSquid: the entire thing

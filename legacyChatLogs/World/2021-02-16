 FlyHead: speaking of bots/NNs, is the main workflow for creating NNs just remaking the game in your own environment?
 FlyHead: i've been searching and it seems like CG doesn't provide environments
 MadKnight: yea 
 FlyHead: do a lot of people do that?
 FlyHead: i'm curious what games get the most attention
 MadKnight: there are referees for some games
 MadKnight: like opened game sources
 FlyHead: ya, i've seen the referees, that's nice
 MadKnight: u can play tons of games with your bot in local
 FlyHead: in local?
 FlyHead: oh, like if you had your own environment
 FlyHead: ya, that's why i'm a little bummed CG doesn't provide environments. other option would be to make a web scraper to pull outputs, clean em, and send em to the NN
 FlyHead: would be slower, but maybe more generic, would work on multiple games
 FlyHead: might be against terms of service, now that i think about it
 ChandraKanth: hi guys.
 Uljahn: the feature is just too niche, FlyHead

 etohirse: only bots on clash
 etohirse: F
 GeorgiD: wait there are bots?
 etohirse: yes
 ianc1339: the players that are on everytime since like 5 years ago
 jacek: eeyup
 ianc1339: btw is coc still bugged for some people?
 etohirse: yep
 ianc1339: i have to refresh the webpage to get into the clash
 etohirse: cant join
 ianc1339: D:
 jacek: oO
 GeorgiD: why do i stay alone in a room every time i try to start today wtf
 jacek: forever alone
 GeorgiD: True
 GeorgiD: Like I literally play 1 clash and then the site bugs out
 jacek: oh my
 Janraion: hello moto
 Rimuru1: hello
 S1geth: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: because you might have to do to make it even worse
 S1geth: yes
 Audatic: how do I approve a submission?
 Audatic: I want to do it and according to my next progress icon its also what the site wants me to do it, but I don;t know how
 Scarfield: Community -&gt; Contributions -&gt; Make sure it works, statement/validators and so on are acceptable for being approved. You need 50+ Clashes played to approve a clash of code, and lvl 20+ to approve classic puzzles
 Audatic: ah I am only lvl 9, I guess that is the missing one
 Wontonimo: anyone know a fast way of calculating UCB1&#160;?  It's taking a wooping 37.5% of all my compute time in uttt.  I made a log lookup and that shaved some off, but only slightly
 Wontonimo: a bitshift psudo log also helped
 Wontonimo: ah , i see there are fast approximate sqrt functions online ...  okay, now I feel like I'm just talking to myself
 alpha..: Hey Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: could be a good idea
 alpha..: :rolling_eyes: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and i am in the morning
 jacek: Wontonimo sqrt is done in 1 instruction. UCB shouldnt be the bottleneck unless the rest is really really optimized
 Wontonimo: my ego wants to say that the rest is really optimized, but maybe i'm just recalculating it too often
 jacek: so we can assume it isnt
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah, the plain-old-sqrt is faster than the "fast sqrt"
 Wontonimo: yes, that's a very safe assumption&#160;:)
 jacek: maybe sqrtf but i doubt it
 Wontonimo: thanks, i'll investigate why I'm calling UCB SOOOOO MUCH ...  it must be my last bug lol
 MSmits: doubtful :P
 Wontonimo: yeah, it was a joke :P
 jacek: btw do you call log(parentVisits) for every children or just once?
 Wontonimo: well, now i'm just embarrassed 
 MSmits: inline float fastlogf(const float&amp; x) { union { float f; uint32_t i; } vx = { x }; float y = vx.i; y *= 8.2629582881927490e-8f; return(y - 87.989971088f); }inline float fastsqrtf(const float&amp; x) { union { int i; float x; }u; u.x = x; u.i = (1 &lt;&lt; 29) + (u.i &gt;&gt; 1) - (1 &lt;&lt; 22); return(u.x); }inline float rsqrt_fast(float x) { return _mm_cvtss_f32(_mm_rsqrt_ss(_mm_set_ss(x))); }
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/367a2733-8136-465c-ac4e-1abb63c541c1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/367a2733-8136-465c-ac4e-1abb63c541c1</a>
 MSmits: use that
 MSmits: the uct function is a child method, gets as parameter the sqrtlog of parent
 Wontonimo: I follow, nice!
 MSmits: i havent found faster than this, but some other methods are equally fast
 MSmits: well... i fact storing the rsqrts in a cache is like 5% faster, but don't... just dont. It's ugly 
 Wontonimo: is "const float&amp; x" significantly faster than "float x"&#160;?  I'm assuming yes because there isn't a copy made
 Wontonimo: (in the function parameters)
 MSmits: i have no clue, i googled these and tested them
 MSmits: possibly the compiler is smart enough to do whatever i sbest?
 Wontonimo: thanks&#160;!  gotta go
 jacek: its inlined so no difference&#160;:?
 jacek: ryzen 5800x :heart:
 MSmits: np, cya
 jacek: finally new computer arrived
 MSmits: ahh nice, congrats
 MSmits: how expensive are these ryzen things compared to a regular computer
 jacek: what is regular computer now?
 MSmits: no idea, i suspect 1k euros for a reasonable one, including a typical gpu?
 MSmits: been a long time since i got new hardware
 jacek: ryzen 3000 series were very good in perf/price comparison at the time
 jacek: now everything went up due to BTC and covid :unamused:
 MSmits: I see
 jacek: mine is about 2k euro for ryzen 5800x + gtx 2060
 jacek: + the rest (32GB RAM etc)
 MSmits: mmh not a bad price at all
 jacek: i couldnt get the 3xxx
 MSmits: did you want an expensive gpu for training NN?
 jacek: fortunately what i do is very parallelizable
 jacek: yes, eventually
 MSmits: what do you do?
 jacek: right now im training NN in cpu only
 jacek: well for example generating games is parallelizable
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense
 MSmits: just make sure you dont do FastRand with a fixed starting seed or something
 MSmits: or you'll do the same games in parallel&#160;:)
 jacek: im using custom xorshift
 jacek: though one time i forgot to seed it...
 MSmits: yeah thats what i meant
 jacek:         auto now = high_resolution_clock::now();
 MSmits: ahh ok good
 jacek: or could have called random_device()() for seed
 gameroo8: hello

 Wontonimo: @jacek the obvious optimization of calculating log once (which I really should have seen) made a huge improvement!  Thanks
 CrusherBrooks: so... basic I/O question, but how am I supposed to debug in python when the "game" takes any print as a command? lol
 Wontonimo: print("my debug statement", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Wontonimo: ^ that's how you print debug in python.  The game doesn't read your debug statements and instead just displays them
 CrusherBrooks: thanks
 CrusherBrooks: never learned about debug statements in uni. oh well
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: you never printed everything to find that one annoying error?
 CrusherBrooks: eh... only manually, using print
 Wontonimo: no errors, no need for debug
 Uljahn: there are hints in some puzzles on the left side of IDE, check them<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor-episode-1</a>
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: thats what you're doing here, using print. the file argument like that is specific to codinggame
 Wontonimo: what?? I've been on this site for 4 months and I haven't noticed hints?
 CrusherBrooks: I saw the hints, but they didn't address my question :P
 CrusherBrooks: what do you mean by "printing everything", btw?
 Wontonimo: the print like that isn't specific to CG.  It works in all python and redirects that print statement to standard error
 Uljahn: there is a commented line in default code then
 Uljahn: # To debug: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: yes, but when debugging normally do you direct it to the error stream?
 CrusherBrooks: I just print out what I want to print out and see if it's right
 Uljahn: that's not normal
 Wontonimo: @Peanutbutter_Warrior  that's the normal way on CG.
 CrusherBrooks: well, that's why I ask lol
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: yeah, im saying its not the normal way in most other ides
 Wontonimo: use the sys.stderr redirect.  But I have seen some people just concat their debug at the end of output.  It only works for games where it is supported, like some bot games.  Don't depend on the concat option
 CrusherBrooks: yeah I used the sys.stderr, it worked. Thanks guys&#160;:)
 RSBat: Peanutbutter_Warrior it is quite normal - Intellij ides even support different colors for stdout/stderr
 Wontonimo: @jacek btw, calc log once moved me from g12 to g6, a bump of 1.5 points.  another 2.5 points to go to get to legend ... i can smell it from here
 struct: do you have teccles heuristic Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: @struct no ... what?  is that something that you can share?
 darkhorse64: You have the pragmas&#160;?
 Wontonimo: just #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast", "inline", "omit-frame-pointer", "unroll-loops")
 struct: if top left is empty
 struct: you play 0 0
 struct: And he must play on that board 
 Wontonimo: yeah, i saw that while watching reCurse and others in the top
 Wontonimo: i've been meaning to implement that, but haven't yet.  thanks for the reminder
 Wontonimo: didn't know if it was just coincidence or actual heuristic, now that i know its an actual thing it is bumped up in my priority list.  Thanks!
 Wontonimo: @darkhorse64 are there other pragma's that you'd recommend?  I really only have ~40hours of c++ under by belt at this point, so I'm just shooting in the dark about pragmas
 Wontonimo: actually, hold that.  MSmits recommended a bunch of others that i haven't been able to get working.  let me work on that first
 darkhorse64: The other pragmas matter only if you want to use SSE, AVX SIMD programming
 darkhorse64: which is yet another level
 darkhorse64: Mostly useful for bitboarding although some people also write sim engines with SIMD
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 JLukeSkywalker: so my csb was all messed up because distance formula had x1-x2 and y1+y2
 JLukeSkywalker: i hate single character mistakes that dont actually error
 Wontonimo: an assert will turn that into an error for you
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: Has anyone done CGX formatter and know what the test case means when it says 'block without spaces not containing a value'?
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: because I'm failing the test for it, but I've no idea how. Testing everything I can think of it meaning passes
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: nvm i found the problem, apparently without spaces does not mean not havving spaces
 DomiKo: CG stats isn't working?
 DreadMCYT: oof
 Astrobytes: seems fine for me DomiKo?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/hypersonic/DomiKo">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/hypersonic/DomiKo</a>
 DomiKo: hypersonic working too?
 Astrobytes: what position and what league you in?
 DomiKo: 7place
 DomiKo: I tried anyone from top10
 DomiKo: and nobody is working&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: In legend I presume. Could be an error, best to ping Magus
 DomiKo: omg
 DomiKo: my bad&#160;:(
 DomiKo: I picked contest
 DomiKo: insted of multi
 DomiKo: ehhhh
 Astrobytes: ahhh lol
 Astrobytes: I've done that before :D
 DomiKo: My friend send me wrong link
 DomiKo: and I didn't think of this
 Astrobytes: hehehe, it happens
 Audatic: I want more code golf challenges but there aren't any
 JLukeSkywalker: you can solve each one in 5 languages
 JLukeSkywalker: really, whoever wins one wins the other, golf-wise they are all the same
 Audatic: yeah but to actually win them you have to know the languages extremely well 
 Audatic: maybe I should just create my own one&#160;:)
 JLukeSkywalker: my point is, as long as you can solve the puzzle, the leaderboard will be the same for every single golf puzzle
 JLukeSkywalker: adding more is pointless
 Audatic: why? The solutions to the puzzles are different paths that require different ideas?
 JLukeSkywalker: but golfing the code is the same
 JLukeSkywalker: otherwise they could just make every single puzzle on here a golf
 Audatic: yeah I don't get why they don't do that. You seem to suggest that golfing is pointless because you can always do it the same way, but that is no true. Otherwise why would entire websites to golfing different problems exist?
 Audatic: maybe it's true for simple problems like "sum the square of these numbers" but surely not for more complex tasks
 reCurse: For sheer entertainment purposes
 reCurse: It has no practical value
 Audatic: yeah this website is for me purely entertainment, I am not learning here - some people might but I don't. 
 reCurse: Sure, it's valid, it's just maybe the least popular section here.
 JLukeSkywalker: just as an example, power of thor and dont panic are insanely different puzzles/algotithms
 JLukeSkywalker: while 1:e=s(c-a);f=s(d-b);c-=e;d-=f;print([<i>,'N','S'][f]+[</i>,'W','E'][e])
 JLukeSkywalker: while 1:f,p,d=I().split();print("BWLAOICTK"[[e[f]&lt;=int(p),e[f]&gt;=int(p)][d[0]&gt;"L"]::2])
 JLukeSkywalker: yet the golfed code is just almost exactly the same
 Audatic: reCurse Yeah but ClashOfCode seems popular and it's entertainment for 90% of people playing. I think there could be more interest - but maybe people don't like code golf that much for various reasons
 reCurse: To better express what I think you're saying here, the most efficient codegolfing entries are about hardcoding the validator answers rather than having a program working as intended for all inputs.
 reCurse: So it's much less about the actual problem
 struct: The only popular thing are contests
 JLukeSkywalker: well, that is part of the problem, but both solutions i posted were not hardcoded
 reCurse: Ah, my bad.
 JLukeSkywalker: when you golf it, every solution in that language is just the same
 JLukeSkywalker: for example python is just an input into an indexed string or list print
 JLukeSkywalker: 99.9% of the time
 reCurse: Audatic: I think there is a certain pretense of how useful it can potentially be elsewhere. Codegolfing is definitely at the bottom, so it probably doesn't help its popularity.
 reCurse: Of course clashing isn't that much better for how useful it can be, but it's arguably better than golfing.
 JLukeSkywalker: plus clash has some python/ruby golfing in it
 Audatic: I think those might be similar but my current solutions to chuckNorris,Temperatures and Thor are completely different.  
 Wontonimo: i think a huge lure to CoC is that it is a small commitment of time to see some results.  I think that's also the lure of bot games where the valid moves are provided.  Super fast to create something
 Wontonimo: how i got on CG was a friend suggested CSB, then we competed in some challenges, then competed on cave dweller, then I discovered CoC then I quit CoC 
 Audatic: I actually haven't tried the bot-programming because it seemed like such a big time investment, but maybe I should check it out. Is there in general a best solution or is your solution depending on other players?
 Astrobytes: Well, you're trying to beat the other players bot at the game in question.
 Audatic: but I can't just do a MinMax Tree search and be done with it because of time constraints? Or are the problems usually NP-hard?
 JLukeSkywalker: there are time constraints
 JLukeSkywalker: usually ~100ms
 Astrobytes: That's where the fun starts
 JLukeSkywalker: per turn
 Astrobytes: A lot are 50ms
 Audatic: okay - I can see the appeal but I can also see the time sink potential :D 
 Astrobytes: There's a reason we're all here you know :P
 AntiSquid: masochism
 Astrobytes: lol
 DomiKo: time sink is huuuggeee
 DomiKo: once you fall into the hole, you can't get out
 Audatic: yeah that seems a bit scary :DSorry to come back to this, but how can I create a Golf challenge? 
 FlyHead: what games have yall been spending time on for the bots?
 struct: only by creating private golf clash
 struct: and then inviting people
 AntiSquid: don't think you can, apart from creating a clash of code shortest mode&#160;:/
 FlyHead: i'm not too deep in it yet, but i'm drawn toward the resources ones like ghost in the cell and the ore harvest one
 Audatic: Why can't I create it via contribute? Like make my own challenge for people (and myself)?
 AntiSquid: unless maybe you wanted to do an optimization puzzle in that direction, like cgfunge&#160;?
 struct: you can create a clash puzzle
 Astrobytes: Well sure, you can create a shortest mode clash as a contribution, or do something like squiddy suggested there (good idea)
 Audatic: yeah but I want some code golf where you spend hours/days not 15 min. Like the 4 we have on the website
 JLukeSkywalker: cgfudge takes weeks
 JLukeSkywalker: im still not done with mine
 JLukeSkywalker: took a break from it with bots
 AntiSquid: have a look, it's not really the same but sort of same principles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/cgfunge-prime">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/cgfunge-prime</a>
 Astrobytes: tbf, there might be better places than CG if you just want straight up golfing
 AntiSquid: very much so
 Angecide: using this github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark is it possible to, instead of me vs enemies, pick a player using agentId and let it play against the enemies to gauge the strength of that specific bot?
 Angecide: like let's say I wanna see how strong someone on top 10 is as player 2 against other top 10 etc.
 DreadMCYT: i am horrible with bots and ai's
 DreadMCYT: an i have to make one
 MSmits: Angecide i am not sure if this is possible with cg bench, but there's no reason it should not be possible to create a tool that can do this, as you can also do it in the IDE
 Angecide: ye that was my thoughts as well
 Angecide: btw msmits, on your new bot, how much loss&#160;% do you have as p2?
 Angecide: against top players
 Angecide: top 10
 Angecide: like purely as player 2
 MSmits: didnt test. But if you just want to know what the p1 advantage is in general it's about 65-70% vs 30-35%
 MSmits: I think the better the bots are, the more biased towards p1 it becomes
 darkhorse64: MSmits, I am looking for the thesis which explained a variety of MM algorithms. Sorry, I failed to bookmark it
 MSmits: I think i know which one you meant sec
 Astrobytes: carolus?

 Astrobytes: hah!
 darkhorse64: You remind me the name
 darkhorse64: thanks both
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: I accidentally submitted in oware&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: does it hurt
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: not particularly but it wasn't ready for a submit
 darkhorse64: dead last&#160;?
 Angecide: I see, I guess those numbers are for bots on similar level I imagine, since top 3 probably have below 50% loss as player 2 against bots lower than top 10
 MSmits: yeah, i mean similar level
 Astrobytes: no 10th currently darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: thzt
 Astrobytes: 11th
 darkhorse64: that's good for a failed attempt
 Astrobytes: yeah it didn't have a typo or anything but I didn't want to submit at all, it'll probably end up where it was before
 DreadMCYT: help
 darkhorse64: 1000 more CP
 jacek: huh
 DreadMCYT: all i am getting is this
 DreadMCYT: at Answer.py. not in a function on line 24
 Astrobytes: typo
 DreadMCYT: if next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 90 or next_checkpoint_angle &gt; -90 then
 DreadMCYT: that is line 24
 DreadMCYT: i am doing the Pseudo Code Algorithm wrong i think 
 Astrobytes: if next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 90 or next_checkpoint_angle &gt; -90:
 Astrobytes: Do you know python?
 DreadMCYT: kinda
 DreadMCYT: i am trying something new
 Astrobytes: 11th, meh. Stupid ankles.
 DreadMCYT: i am new to coding 
 Astrobytes:  I figured that
 Astrobytes: CG isn't the best unless you have the basics down pat already
 JJ-TT: what would be good for revising the basics?
 Valdez001: acho que algoritmos
 DreadMCYT: what is the best code for my first bot
 RSBat: anybody from top gold/low legend in uttt running MCTS here?
 RSBat: how many rollouts per turn do you have?
 struct: yes
 struct: 25k+-
 struct: on 2nd turn
 DreadMCYT: need help with something
 jacek: oh my
 JohnathanBarbee: I'm in gold in UTTT and I'm currently trying to implement MCTS
 DreadMCYT: line 6 on my coding is incorrect 
 DreadMCYT: and all it is 
 DreadMCYT: is this
 DreadMCYT: else
 jacek: missing&#160;:&#160;?
 JohnathanBarbee: what language?
 jacek: gold without MCTS? what do you use now
 DreadMCYT: python 3
 RSBat: thanks, time to optimize a lot then
 struct: I doubt uttt legend with python is feasible
 JohnathanBarbee: I did a really simple fitness score that weighed each valid move for the optimal strategy. Highest fitness score was my next move
 Angecide: the trick is to use c++ to get into legend and then switch to python
 aetrnm: Hey guys, any option to simulate backspace here in c++?
 DreadMCYT: i am doing the tutorial on how to make an AI/Bot
 Kaldorem: same
 DreadMCYT: and i cannot figure this out
 Kaldorem: which problem?
 DreadMCYT: Pseudo Code Algorithm
 JLukeSkywalker: think he means the csb onboarding
 Astrobytes: It tells you the logic, you have to implement that in whatever language
 Astrobytes: you can post your code here
 Astrobytes: It will automatically pastebin and someone will take a look
 DreadMCYT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/860239db-216c-4654-a413-aca816c6c1ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/860239db-216c-4654-a413-aca816c6c1ae</a>
 reCurse: Oh wow it's fixed
 DreadMCYT: line 26
 jacek: bad indent?
 struct: shift tab the print
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, get the print out of indent
 Astrobytes: been fixed for a wee while reCurse (and remained fixed!)
 struct: tab the if else*
 JLukeSkywalker: and put thrust in the print
 JLukeSkywalker: instead of 80
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0dd169ec-e48a-4631-8865-e6de4aa0dc51">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0dd169ec-e48a-4631-8865-e6de4aa0dc51</a>
 struct: replace the "80" by thrust
 Astrobytes: everything needs to be in the scope of the while loop
 struct: I didnt do it
 struct: Also does thrust need to be declared?
 Kaldorem: you can declare it or write it on the print instead
 Astrobytes: uh, if it's before a conditional I think so
 Astrobytes: who knows though, it's python
 DreadMCYT: now it is line 25
 struct: missing&#160;:
 struct: after else
 struct: else:
 DreadMCYT: nope
 Astrobytes: paste the code again
 struct: declare thrust
 Astrobytes: ^^^
 Astrobytes: set it to whatever BEFORE the if else
 jacek: this is really very basic syntax problem, something out of scope of noviceness of CG
 DreadMCYT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cef59e29-ba76-4b6f-981b-63726719cf89">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cef59e29-ba76-4b6f-981b-63726719cf89</a>
 Astrobytes: jacek: I tried to tell them earlier
 struct: you need to ident the stuff inside the if and the else
 Astrobytes: Python needs indentation
 Astrobytes: You need to practice python. For real.
 Andriamanitra: is that not what they're doing..?
 Astrobytes: Andriamanitra: not effectively on here, CG won't help you learn the basics if you don't know them
 JohnathanBarbee: I disagree
 Astrobytes: That's outside the scope of CG, unless you're a very enthusiastic dedicated learner.
 JohnathanBarbee: They very well could be
 Astrobytes: In which case they'd have looked up the correct syntax already
 struct: Unless you are already familiar with programming
 JohnathanBarbee: not necessarily. They may not have known what the issue was to look it up.
 Kaldorem: Or you can google it as you find it
 Astrobytes: We have told them the issue
 Astrobytes: And they're new to coding
 Astrobytes: *issues
 DreadMCYT: FINALLY
 DreadMCYT: i figured out what was wrong
 Andriamanitra: gj mate
 Kaldorem: that's nice! :D
 JohnathanBarbee: Awesome
 Astrobytes: I give up.
 DreadMCYT: on what
 JLukeSkywalker: csb can only turn by 18 degrees right?
 JLukeSkywalker: and does it turn, then thrust?
 struct: yes
 JLukeSkywalker: ty
 DreadMCYT: is this code good XD
 DreadMCYT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1260cf36-402a-4511-97b6-39eeeeeea365">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1260cf36-402a-4511-97b6-39eeeeeea365</a>
 struct: Nice copy paste
 struct: You are only cheating yourself but w/e
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Now I could say "I told you so" or I could just gloat silently.
 JohnathanBarbee: Again thats assuming that he uses that code in his bot.
 JohnathanBarbee: But do either one
 struct: You are right
 struct: Reading code is fine
 struct: I jumped to judgement 
 DreadMCYT: sorry caps lock
 DreadMCYT: i am doing boost
 JohnathanBarbee: @struct you're good. I was mainly talking to astro
 Astrobytes: Whatever.
 TomiiPomii: why don't some people share their code
 JLukeSkywalker: sometimes because they are already on the next clash
 JLukeSkywalker: click submit, click play again
 JohnathanBarbee: ^
 JLukeSkywalker: also some of those 'people' are bots
 JLukeSkywalker: idk if the bots share
 Astrobytes: You can also PM them or ping them, sometimes people just forget
 Astrobytes: Not sure if the bots do or not tbh.
 Scarfield: You can PM the bots to ask
 Astrobytes: GoodTimingField
 Scarfield: HowSoStrobytes
 Astrobytes: It was a good moment for you to pop up and make that comment is all :P

 jacek: cheesy
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: Did you bitboard it yet jacek?
 Astrobytes: I'm not starting until I'm finished with the outstanding multi contributions.
 Scarfield: havent done anything the last couple of days, but "done" with the most of the bitboarding. Need to add en passant, and avoid adding moves that either result in a check, or doesnt reject a check
 jacek: not yet. got into checkers now
 Astrobytes: Nice Scarfield. 
 Astrobytes: Ah checkers is hot because of reBless?
 Scarfield: ye, i really wanted to do EPT for it, but will probably do minmax, still havent decided&#160;:)
 jacek: im gonna learn how to deal with endgames and draw cycles
 Astrobytes: I think everything is fair game in 960 Scarfield.
 Astrobytes: Training on endgame tables jacek?
 jacek: nah. detecting 3-fold repetitions
 jacek: and treating it as draws in selection
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, crap, I remember you said the other day
 jacek: this way the 'winning' will avoid those, while the 'losing' will keep repeating those
 Astrobytes: Yes, makes sense.
 jacek: my bot can get into good position and it knows its good, but can't finish it
 Scarfield: are you using zobrist, im probably gonna try it for this bot
 jacek: i never used zobrist. i just hash entire position
 Astrobytes: jacek uses his own special hashing method, everyone else zobrists
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: jacek, you know it does hash the whole board state right
 Scarfield: hmm just thought that a transpostion table wouldnt take 3fold rep. into account
 DreadMCYT: i beat boss 3 and i am not going further i did the boost code
 jacek: Astrobytes as i understand, zobrist is just incremental hash, so its faster. but this isnt my bottleneck
 Astrobytes: yeah that's fair enough jacek
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Might require extra space in the entries, or maybe a repetition table? I'm actually not sure
 Astrobytes: DreadMCYT: you progressed to next league?
 DreadMCYT:&#160;???
 Astrobytes: You said you beat Boss 3
 DreadMCYT: yeah
 DreadMCYT: twice
 Scarfield: im still far from starting to implement TT, but i think i would just have to ignore the potential error from different "repetition tables". seems way more expensive to take into account than its benefit
 Astrobytes: Sometimes sacrificing computation/access time can be beneficial, but yeah I couldn't comment currently tbh
 jacek: or use EPT and stop dealing with TT :v
 Scarfield: xD or that
 Astrobytes: He did think of it&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: massive eruption at etna today
 JLukeSkywalker: lol this is hilarious, put in angle based PID into csb, and it isnt tuned yet
 JLukeSkywalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/529073272">https://www.codingame.com/replay/529073272</a>
 KornelToth: holly shit
 JLukeSkywalker: it still made it
 Astrobytes: JLukeSkywalker: in gold now?
 JLukeSkywalker: no, not tuned at all
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: it was about due one really
 Astrobytes: Gold is literally just the formula MK gave you - nothing else other than your vel calc
 Anonymous_axel: how do i fix this error   Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... will no longer be active in this game.
 Astrobytes: You may have actually timed out, not provided a newline after outputting, or failed to provide output
 JohnathanBarbee: Could be a couple problems. Biggest one is infinite loop or not outputing a string fast enough
 Anonymous_axel: its on coders strike back on the tutorial 
 Anonymous_axel: tried everything but keep getting same error
 Astrobytes: Is there a run on CSB this evening?
 JLukeSkywalker: i mean it is the onboarding, they are probably all new to the site
 JLukeSkywalker: all MK told me was 'subtract velocity'
 Astrobytes: Yeah but unusual to get a glut like this at this time of day.
 Anonymous_axel: yeah im new to coding&#160;:/ i wanted to learn ha
 JLukeSkywalker: i ran a full PID based on distances and tuned it, and was still silver 24k
 Scarfield: have you just gotten to a new league Anonymous_axel? the inputs change from league to league in some games
 Anonymous_axel: im on wood 2 league
 Anonymous_axel: it says i can now use distance and angle 
 Scarfield: In CSB the input changes thoughout most of the leagues, that could be your issue, if you just ranked up. "Restore default code" in top right will give you the new basic code to read the input. Remember to copy the code you wrote the paste back
 Scarfield: *to paste back
 Anonymous_axel: ok i just reset the code
 Anonymous_axel: now im not moving 
 JohnathanBarbee: Right. you have to paste back in your code. and alter it to accept and use the new variables given
 Scarfield: ^
 Scarfield: but im off for now, gn all
 Anonymous_axel: oooh ok thanks 
 JohnathanBarbee: gn
 Anonymous_axel: i copied and pasted the psuedo code it still isnt working i should give up haha
 Astrobytes: gn Scarfield
 Astrobytes: Anonymous_axel: it's 'pseudo' code for a reason - it's not actual code
 Anonymous_axel: wooow haha
 Anonymous_axel: so how do i apply it?
 Astrobytes: What language are you using?
 Anonymous_axel: python
 Astrobytes: brb, 1 min
 Anonymous_axel: ok
 Astrobytes: ok, less than 1 min. Well the pseudo code is almost python, if you can use python you can translate it easily.
 Anonymous_axel: ill copy and paste the code here
 Anonymous_axel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c59f3089-8912-4869-947f-16c71e1d7301">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c59f3089-8912-4869-947f-16c71e1d7301</a>
 Anonymous_axel: how do i apply it as a code?
 Wontonimo: python needs things like ":" at the end of if and else blocks
 Wontonimo: don't paste it as-is, read it over and use it to write python
 Astrobytes: ^
 Anonymous_axel: do i just use print"nextcheckpointangle"?
 Astrobytes: Look up how to do these things in python

 Anonymous_axel: still not doing it im so confused right now
 DreadMCYT: one sec

 Anonymous_axel: it fixed it for fist tutorial now i just need the angle 
 Astrobytes: ...
 DreadMCYT: .......
 Astrobytes: Maybe try an easy puzzle instead?
 Astrobytes: You don't *have* to do this tutorial if you struggle with it.
 ianc1339: try this out <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.learnpython.org/">https://www.learnpython.org/</a>
 ianc1339: good for starting out python
 DreadMCYT: i need help with boost 
 RockNTroll: B O O S T
 Urkchar: pog
 lkottler: shark
 iiAbusinq: whats a widely used programming language which is fun to learn?
 Wontonimo: rust
 Wontonimo: bwah hahaha
 iiAbusinq: i honestly have no idea what im doing
 Wontonimo: fun?  tell me more about this word.  If you want fairly easy, i'd say python.  If you want to know what is happening on the metal, c/c++.  If you'd like something like c but with training wheels, java
 Wontonimo: if you want to make games with unity, c#
 Wontonimo: webpage stuff, javascript
 iiAbusinq: Easy to understand the basics, don't want to be able to do the diffucult big code things etc yet, but i'd really like to learn the basics of coding
 JohnnyLuke: if you just want to learn to code for fun, i would say python
 Wontonimo: have you tried scratch by mit&#160;?
 JohnnyLuke: if you want to learn to use it later professionally, i would say learn a flavor of c
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">https://scratch.mit.edu/</a>
 Wontonimo: it's "fun"
 iiAbusinq: What's scratch? 
 JohnnyLuke: drag'n'drop code
 iiAbusinq: Ah I see
 iiAbusinq: So that'll help me understand basic terms I guess?
 Wontonimo: and it's turing complete.  I gave my kids an assignment to implement the sqrt function using division, multiplication, and the newtonian method. 
 Wontonimo: yeah, it will definitely help you learn the basics of "if" statements and logic if you've never coded before
 iiAbusinq: I understand the concept of the if, then, else, etc
 Wontonimo: have you watched "the coding train" on youtube?  Fun guy.  He does mostly javascript and "FUN" projects
 iiAbusinq: but i don't think I can use them correctly
 iiAbusinq: I'll check that out!
 Wontonimo: he does a wide range of stuff and publishes nearly every day
 Wontonimo: he shows his mistakes and debugging also, so for a beginner that stuff is gold
 iiAbusinq: Would you say this site would be any use to a beginner beginner like me? or should I come back once I got the basics under control haha
 JohnnyLuke: i would say try the on-boarding puzzle and 1 or 2 easy puzzles
 JohnnyLuke: if you cant do those, come back
 iiAbusinq: Any way to sort on easy puzzles?
 JohnnyLuke: if you hit practice, there is a pre-sorted easy category
 Wontonimo: yeh, let me find a couple for you
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 iiAbusinq: What do the starts represent, ratings of difficulty, or  how much they'd suggest me doing those?
 Wontonimo: and then try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1</a>
 Wontonimo: and then, if you can do both of those, try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mime-type">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mime-type</a>
 Wontonimo: The puzzles become a lot harder after these
 iiAbusinq: Alright thanks!

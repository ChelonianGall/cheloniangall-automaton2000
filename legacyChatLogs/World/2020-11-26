 rockstar555: HOW TO BECAME A MODERATOR
 Uljahn: i think you should have such prerequisites as dedication and loyalty to the platform, good knowledge of CG activities, be frequent on the forum, be helpful and almost always online, though it's up to staff to choose you as one
 Skynse:  Imagine if William Lin was on this website
 Skynse: dude would finish everything
 Xepponir: xD
 philRG: @miszu that is true, it is why it is important to write simple code in first leagues
 wlesavo: miszu that looks like 99.7% loss, your mcts is probably buged
 LordSkaven: Or maybe his AI is so good that it wants to lose, maybe the AI doesnt like winning all the time
 darkhorse64: @miszu: if your bot is OK, you should get a 60+&#160;% winning rate for first player at the first turn
 AntiSquid: rockstar555 quit the nonsense please, it's annoying
 AntiSquid: referring to the random spam messages "hii" / "how to become mod" in full caps .
 wlesavo: how to become mod automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and you might have to be more like a puzzle
 Uljahn: how to become Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: no idea what the problem is, i need to learn the basics of a language
 LordSkaven: How to become root Automaton2000

 hiukan: OMG IT WORKED!!
 hiukan: Thank you so much!! &lt;3
 struct: also becarefull when using same var name on for loops
 struct: you have nested for and both vars use i
 hiukan: careful in which sense?
 struct: its working, but its not a good thing to do
 struct: on js i think it works fine

 eulerscheZahl: part of that lib
 eulerscheZahl: and i kicked pixi

 Q12: wow!!
 Q12: I don't want to even think about how much time did it take to do this, it is crazy!!
 eulerscheZahl: it's also automated. solve in C++ and write a wrapper for each other language once
 Q12: You still need to know all those languages very good.
 struct: no, you just need to know 1
 Q12: so how do you translate the language you know to language you don't know you also need to know the other language. (the code for this you can write in the already known language).If you have an idea to how to do this without know the second language then I would love to know how.
 Illedan: Oh, he automated that eulerscheZahl? Daym
 Uljahn: i guess there is some info in one of his puzzles
 struct: the 3d time line looks nice
 Illedan: True Uljahn. I guess he simply invoke C++ like a text file :D
 struct: does brutaltester works fine with openjdk 8 on ubuntu?
 VizGhar: You can code in Java and there is this magic button Convert Java file to Kotlin file and BOOOM you have one puzzle sloved in 2 languages at once :P
 VizGhar: you just have to find such button for other 30+ languages 
 VizGhar: (talking about idea)
 DaNinja: see his Abusing the System contribution
 eulerscheZahl: there was a contest on codeforces: Kotlin heroesyou had to code exclusively in Kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: so that converter in IntelliJ came to a big help
 Illedan: Wow, I got blocked in FC where every spell required a Tier0 item. And I had no space to get it -.-

 eulerscheZahl: thanks, the heavy lifting is done i think
 EEngineer: Does anyone know if it is possible to play a lower league after completing it? I am wanting to try a python implement, but the additional bot and rules in Gold league for coders strike back makes starting with another language difficult
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl what about an ∞D-CGFunge?&#160;;)
 dbdr: I have a solver for that
 reCurse: EEngineer: There is no way except creating a new account
 eulerscheZahl: you can always ignore the other dimensions and keep playing in 2D?
 dbdr: I need the other dimensions
 struct: also what im doing is 3d viewer, not 3d game
 dbdr: actually something like 10 is probably enogh
 eulerscheZahl: i see struct. like the next RAIC

 ZarthaxX: yes
 ZarthaxX: im lurking 
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: Im just playing with three js for now
 struct: following their tutorial
 eulerscheZahl: so, next: bigger blocks and dropping animation
 ZarthaxX: are you going to do that box thing like in the DOS game?
 eulerscheZahl: box thing?
 miszu: question, to avoid using vectors, do you guys use the following technique: use a pool of array and the 1st index is the length of your array and the rest is your children
 struct: ZarthaxX how are your physics skills?
 struct: I use a pool miszu
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/FAHA6M7xT5M?t=106">https://youtu.be/FAHA6M7xT5M?t=106</a> 
 miszu: yeah I pool but that array just contains int that I will use to create my nodes
 ZarthaxX: im a great psychic
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: what do you need struct
 struct: How hard is it to code something like this

 darkhorse64: A pool o nodes
 struct: ^
 AntiSquid: including the graphics&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: struct i would say it's easy
 struct: the graphics are the easy part
 ZarthaxX: formulas for applying a force to an object and simulatin how it moves in t time
 AntiSquid: other way around imo :P
 AntiSquid: struct
 ZarthaxX: as this is nto the real world you can make the simulation "perfect"
 ZarthaxX: under ideal conditions
 ZarthaxX: anyway, remember we have smito who knows about physics&#160;;)
 struct: ok, because ball doesnt only have x y z velocity
 struct: but also rotates
 ZarthaxX: he can throw you the formulas
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: but that' s jsut some googling i guess
 ZarthaxX: or again, wait for smito
 struct: Yeah
 AntiSquid: he can throw you to the formulas
 miszu: well I would use 2 pools. One for the moves and then a pool of nodes
 Westicles: Pool is tough.  Between english and modeling the cushions
 darkhorse64: A move is an int. No need for a pool
 AntiSquid: new blog post <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/how-to-retrain-developer-guide/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/how-to-retrain-developer-guide/</a>
 struct: Yeah Westicles ill see if I can find something good online to guide me
 miszu: the reason is in my Board class I want to make an int[] getAllNextMoves
 Westicles: You know you have a good sim if it is possible to shoot the balls off the table
 struct: yeah
 struct: also to jump ball if you hit the cushion
 struct: top spin and hit cushion hard enough and ball will jump
 AntiSquid: are you doing a physics game for CG or something else?
 AntiSquid: because if it's the former, the physics don't matter much, people just use the rules in the referee so w/e ...
 reCurse: In the second case you'll argue with people for months over the formulas
 struct: That is if anyone plays it
 reCurse: Follow the CG flowchart
 reCurse: Is it a community multi?
 struct: I dont know yet
 struct: Just an idea for now
 reCurse: You went off script
 struct: yes*
 reCurse: Then no
 reCurse: The only theory left to validate is releasing a community multi as an unofficial contest
 reCurse: BR doesn't count because it got no exposure in comparison
 struct: I understand, if you do something good you expect at least a little bit exposure
 struct: I think BR was good
 struct: Deserved more
 struct: Even if some games are not worthy of a 14 days contest, I think a 1 weekend contest would be nice for some
 prO_Ogrmr: hey struct
 prO_Ogrmr: i want to message u personal
 prO_Ogrmr: will u follow me

 LastRick: new game? old contest? doesn't look like many people played it
 eulerscheZahl: one of the first community multiplayer games
 eulerscheZahl: never a contest

 reCurse: In a few years I'll change my avatar to Abe Simpson yelling at clouds

 reCurse: Did I
 eulerscheZahl: i think you did
 eulerscheZahl: won't dig through chat logs now
 eulerscheZahl: get back the rattle snake
 reCurse: I would be surprised if I did
 reCurse: Since I like changing avatars once in a while
 eulerscheZahl: i only set one to see myself easier in the last battles list
 eulerscheZahl: now they make the other player a bit transparent, i don't even need it anymore :thinking:
 reCurse: No it's still annoying to be avatarless
 reCurse: I wish CG would just get those hashvatars or whatever they're called
 LastRick: I think I've seen someone else use the frog
 jrke: maybe davier lastrick
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen a few toads other than me already
 eulerscheZahl: popular futurama character
 LastRick: yes
 BoBot: there was definitely one I mistook you for in Fall Challenge, with crazier eyes
 LastRick: i think thats where i saw it too
 jrke: i am still not aware of generating different rands all time in c++ can anyone tell me?
 BoBot: he was in a lower league, so I guess I should be ashamed of thinking it was you...
 eulerscheZahl: srand(time(NULL))
 eulerscheZahl: do that once in your code. then normal rand()
 reCurse: Or if you prefer determinism, hash the input state as a seed
 jrke: okae
 reCurse: And yes deterministic RNG is a thing.
 BoBot: I would say that non-deterministic RNG is not a thing?! on most hardware :D
 BoBot: or actually, I do not know how they gather entropy...
 Westicles: rand() is awful though.  better to use #include&lt;random&gt;
 reCurse: If you hate speed sure
 reCurse: :P
 LastRick: hah
 reCurse: Not that rand() isn't awful
 reCurse: Just copy/paste xorshift or whatever
 reCurse: Though didn't recent GCC fix default rand() to be at least a bit better?
 reCurse: I forgot
 Westicles: Oh, maybe they fixed it.  Mersenne twister probably
 reCurse: rip performance
 Westicles: It comes in handy if you are running things for days.  Weird to see getting the same solutions over and over with rand(), then new stuff with a better rng
 reCurse: I'd still recommend giving SOTA LCGs a try before going full MT or crypto
 MSmits: you can get non-deterministic RNG by sampling a quantum state 
 reCurse: Oh hello
 MSmits: hi reCurse, congrats on your performance in the last contest
 reCurse: Thanks
 MSmits: many contestants so the rank is worth more
 MSmits: not in the formulas, but in recognition I mean
 reCurse: I work with absolute values
 MSmits: I know
 MSmits: I don't :P
 MSmits: I learned a little bit of machine learning, was kind of fun. Mind you, just table based Q-learning, but I made it graphical and used it in an AI course I am making for work
 reCurse: Oh that's cool
 reCurse: Let me guess, gridworld?
 MSmits: hexapawn, 3 x 3 pawns, for live training vs human, takes 20 games for it to start being unbeatable
 MSmits: then 4x4 with selftraining

 MSmits: yeah i use turtle for teaching coding to lower years, so it's appropriate
 reCurse: I think you used the same source as Halite 3 did for assets hehe
 MSmits: thats entirely possible
 MSmits: btw, it's super slow, it's already python, but also ran in browser
 MSmits: i did a 5x5 version with self training
 MSmits: took half an hour, 200k games and 800 mb of RAM
 reCurse: oof
 MSmits: but 4x4 is very doable
 MSmits: funny thing is, it's solved as win for white
 MSmits: but when i let the students play white
 reCurse: One day it will be more straightforward to compile c++ to wasm, or did we get there already
 MSmits: they still lose
 reCurse: Then you can get something fast and in browser
 MSmits: that would be very cool
 MSmits: I'll be putting the tensor flow playground by google in my course also
 MSmits: they have many options for embedding I think
 reCurse: Nice
 reCurse: Yeah
 MSmits: just have to think about how to build it up. it's complicated even though it's as simple as they could make it
 reCurse: But no simpler
 MSmits: you can hide options and such
 MSmits: I like how you can choose different input types and pick the right one based on the type of data
 reCurse: Yeah it's quite well made
 reCurse: I still prefer pytorch by a mile though
 MSmits: yeah, but i won't actually be coding much
 MSmits: most of my course is Code-free
 reCurse: Ok
 MSmits: AI is pretty complex when it comes to coding
 MSmits: there are no small AI's
 MSmits: well unless you do -3vel in csb :P
 reCurse: I thought you said AI
 MSmits: these guys can do simple loops and functions if i remind them how to do it
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: :D
 wlesavo: MSmits took me 3 games to solve 4x4 for whites 
 MSmits: yes, which means my students need at least 10, perfect
 MSmits: I lost a lot more than 3 btw :P
 MSmits: oh, something funny 
 struct: I lost 6
 wlesavo: i guess i started wrong, with some luck you can get first move right
 MSmits: you'll like this
 jrke: MSmits i am waiting for your dots and boxes AI from last few months :expressionless:
 MSmits: my highest class started like this today
 MSmits: a student came to me, hey, want to play a game of uttt?
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 wlesavo: lul
 MSmits: I said, sure, but I know the game pretty well
 MSmits: so he said, you can be player 1
 reCurse: That's when you gave them a F right
 MSmits: then i said, but player 1 wins about 70%
 MSmits: he said thats fine
 MSmits: I did the teccles opening
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: this is so good
 MSmits: then he beat me, with me winning 4 boards and he won 3
 MSmits: in a row
 ZarthaxX: D:
 MSmits: I suck at uttt :P
 MSmits: i only know the opening
 reCurse: Should have printed out your opening book
 wlesavo: lol
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 miszu: have your game engine on the side to tell you you best next move
 MSmits: reCurse it doesnt go that deep unfortunately :P
 MSmits: miszu, i am a bit wary of that
 MSmits: if i make my bot so it can interact with a human, i could make a mistake and end up sharing my code
 MSmits: that would ruin the game for everyone
 reCurse: That's cheating. Using an opening book with your brain as engine though is all good.
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 struct: rip my keyboard
 struct: damn water
 wlesavo: its like chess open moves
 MSmits: I did a few chess games
 MSmits: got inspired by queens gambit series

 MSmits: it's great reCurse
 reCurse: That's what I keep hearing

 reCurse: I got back into chess with the streaming boom back in march/april
 reCurse: Well, a little
 MSmits: I havent played chess for 30 years or so
 MSmits: so i was surprised i didnt make a fool of myself in those games&#160;:)
 reCurse: So no fool's mate
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: but it's weird, i start on that site and somehow i was expecting to face some poor players
 MSmits: but they dont make any mistake like forks and such
 MSmits: not even the beginners
 reCurse: 1k is not beginner
 reCurse: And it probably matches you vs similar unsure rating players
 reCurse: Curb smurfing
 MSmits: yeah, well... i did 1 game against a beginner AI, then i won and immediately started facing 800-1100 rating players
 MSmits: it's a weird experience, my head is all red and warm after a game. It makes me think more than when I am coding
 reCurse: It's the competition
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 reCurse: And you're usually not so harshly punished for a slight oversight when coding
 MSmits: very true
 struct: 400 is where you gonna see random piece movements
 Westicles: Also, tranquilizers help quite a bit
 Westicles: In late with the queens gambit reference...
 MSmits: i feel like i missed out on 400&#160;:(
 struct: I played a month or so during april
 struct: got to around 1200 on rapid
 reCurse: I sort of stopped when I started worrying about opening theory again
 reCurse: Reminds me too much of memorizing SC2 build orders, it sucks
 MSmits: I agree
 MSmits: but a big part of chess is memorizing good orders for like the first 10 moves and then use brain for the rest right?
 MSmits: it's very much like how I get nr 1's on board games :P
 reCurse: They keep saying people under 1500 or even 1800 shouldn't worry about opening theory
 reCurse: They are right
 reCurse: But somehow I still feel like I can be put way behind with a stupid misplacement early
 reCurse: Especially since some people love their trap openings
 MSmits: yeah I have that problem also
 miszu: are we talking human vs human chess?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: yes
 miszu: I used to play competitive in high school
 miszu: what's important in an opening is to understand why you move pieces that way and what's the middlegame strategies
 reCurse: I understand the general idea
 reCurse: Problem is dealing with people's traps
 reCurse: I stopped playing e5 as black for that reason
 miszu: reCurse that's with time. You only fall to a trap once.
 reCurse: (as a response to e4)
 reCurse: Oh that's what you'd think
 miszu: I play sicilian if I play vs e4
 reCurse: There are so many to deal with in e4/e5 that I keep forgetting one of them
 MSmits: miszu's mind is like Q-learning with learning rate 1
 miszu: sicilian is very aggresive
 MSmits: me too, cuz they did it on the series :P
 reCurse: It's also pretty complex
 reCurse: I stick to caro-kann personally
 miszu: I was white and I played vs closes sicilian. That messed up my game
 miszu: closed*
 MSmits: it seems easier to play black in openings because white almost always plays e4 right?
 reCurse: At beginner level
 reCurse: Then it's d4 all the time
 miszu: d4 is popular
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: isnt that queens gambit?
 miszu: if I am vs d4, I play semi slav
 reCurse: Not necessarily
 miszu: correct
 miszu: well
 reCurse: Needs to be d4 d5 c4
 miszu: followed by c4
 MSmits: ah ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, someone's been watching Netflix
 reCurse: I tried playing the c6 response
 reCurse: Because it looks like caro kann
 MSmits: I think it's pretty weird to start playing chess after studying a dozen board-like games on CG 
 reCurse: But then I get wrecked
 MSmits: it gives you a whole different perspective
 MSmits: I keep thinking... hmm i should code a bot to assist me
 MSmits: but... they already exist and it's cheating :P
 reCurse: I had that exact feeling playing shogi
 reCurse: Maybe a bot would help me learn...?
 reCurse: Hehe
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: Just wait until I finish porting it, then you can give it a try
 reCurse: I'm more interested into it as a player though
 reCurse: As a game it's already been extensively studied
 Illedan: ETA of chess multi?
 struct: 1 day
 reCurse: I'll do it
 reCurse: But not chess
 reCurse: It will be crazychess 960
 struct: crazy is place pieces agan right?
 reCurse: Yes
 struct: nice
 reCurse: This weekend maybe
 Illedan: Sweet&#160;:)
 reCurse: That I start working on it I mean
 Illedan: 3D viewer?
 reCurse: The answer to this question is the opposite of do you want to see it shipped
 struct: sound?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "No Stress Chess"&#160;?  with cards?
 Illedan: jking. Make it normal in 2d viewer :D
 struct: What would you say is the best multi to apply GA?
 struct: CSB?
 reCurse: None
 struct: o.o
 struct: Isnt GA used on FB?
 struct: or not anymore
 Westicles: Number Shifting
 reCurse: FB is dead game
 Westicles: oh, multi...
 eulerscheZahl: number shifting great multiplayer game
 struct: reCurse you dont have to fear me
 reCurse:&#160;?
 Guinsoo: Can I get rid of the skills on my profile?
 struct: your rank 1 is safe there I mean
 reCurse: That's not what I was going on about
 struct: Which multi isnt dead though?
 reCurse: Hmm. Any where a few top 100 have submitted in the last few months?
 reCurse: Feel free to elaborate the definition
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u think? eulerscheZahl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My cooking will be done in 15 minutes, so I will not bother yall
 Guinsoo: wow you're first on half the games I'm leaving the chat xD
 Westicles: Can you go back and unclick your skills?
 struct: no
 Westicles: Glad I never checked any.  Too much clutter
 eulerscheZahl: same
 struct: ah wait i got confused with certifications
 struct: I think you can unclick skills
 eulerscheZahl: but i made the mistake to click the quest map. now i have those "certificates"
 ZarthaxX: you dont like them?
 struct: you have coc certification?
 eulerscheZahl: the developer knows how to develop a complex AI [...] The system can include machine learning
 eulerscheZahl: no i don't
 ZarthaxX: you dont like the lies it says ok :P
 reCurse: He doesn't like *marketing
 Westicles: Just wait until they add the streaming achievement
 ZarthaxX: understandable haha
 iWillKickYourAss: .
 Westicles: Is anybody working on freecell?  That needs to get approved
 eulerscheZahl: i started
 eulerscheZahl: then the contest had priority
 LastRick: everything else stopped during the contest. 
 eulerscheZahl: and now i want blockout first
 Westicles: I found some c code to at least verify the solutions, but the autoplay messes things up
 eulerscheZahl: what i feared too
 wlesavo: Westicles did you actually used GA on NS? i thought you ended up with SA 
 Westicles: Isn't SA a subset of GA?
 DomiKo: it is
 wlesavo: well it is still different algos in general understanding
 Westicles: Ah, well no I haven't changed algorithms. 
 wlesavo: i tried GA without much success, the mixing part didnt have much of a sence in NS to me
 Westicles: The guy in first said a little about his solution.  LAHC or whatever
 wlesavo: yeah, similar to marchette i guess, but 1 min to 240 is insane 
 Westicles: on one core
 dbdr: is that in a forum post?
 eulerscheZahl: twitter
 MSmits: jrke still here? I'll get that D&amp;B bot up one of these days. I just need to make it to christmas with all this work
 MSmits: dont remember ever being so busy
 Westicles: Somewhere in here between the cats and the naked cartoon girls
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/xevixevi?lang=en">https://twitter.com/xevixevi?lang=en</a>
 MSmits: oh for a moment I thought you meant thats where jrke is
 MSmits: it sounded reasonable somehow :P
 Westicles: heh heh, could be
 Westicles: oh, it says one hour to 240 on a single thread
 Westicles: Starting from a completely random procedure, it is rearranged a little randomly and evaluated, so it depends on the god of random numbers whether it can be solved or not. By the way, with the current program, it takes 1 hour to solve up to Level 240 in a single thread.
 eulerscheZahl: still impressive
 Westicles: Yeah, much faster than mine.  I think I would be a day a level where I'm at
 AntiSquid: lahc dancing link wasn't it?
 AntiSquid: links *

 SurduTony: yo you lost no nut november or what?
 tAN: wassup?
 tAN: wish me a good luck
 tAN: starting a clash in 10 seconds
 MadKnight: wasting good luck on clashes?
 Skynse: Joined a clash, ended up falling asleep and missing it by 4 hours
 Skynse: But that sleep was gooood tho
 meh1001: got to let your brain run GC sometimes
 Skynse: lol
 vidraa: what's wrong with the servers
 Skynse: Probably maintenance 
 Skynse: yo no one can see my messages then
 Skynse: cool
 lifran: Ah, good, it's not just me. :D
 Bikoko: hmm whatsup
 JohnCM: servers seem to be ok now
 HorseNuggets: johncm is a really fast typer
 JohnCM: lol
 miszu: qq about using a pool and wrapping around
 miszu: do you do like this?
 miszu: leaf-&gt;children + randomIndex&#160;% NODE_POOL_SIZE;
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i am silver in CSB ;D
 Rodrigo_the_coder: :D
 ZarthaxX: randomIndex?
 miszu: ZarthaxX it's just an integer
 miszu: the point is that I don't want that children + randomIndex goes outside of the nodepoolsize
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: you just wnated to show the idea hehe
 ZarthaxX: yeah, you are good
 miszu: ok ty
 miszu: sanity check haha
 Rodrigo_the_coder: boost = silver
 Rodrigo_the_coder: shield = gold
 Rodrigo_the_coder: class pod1: and class pod2: = legend
 Rodrigo_the_coder: hello
 Rodrigo_the_coder: anyone there?
 Rodrigo_the_coder:&#160;:(
 Rodrigo_the_coder:&#160;;(
 Rodrigo_the_coder: :sob:
 ClockSort:&#160;;)
 Rodrigo_the_coder: hooray
 Rodrigo_the_coder: wtf, nnobody chatted
 HorseNuggets: yes
 HorseNuggets: we are all very socially active people
 ClockSort: of course. programmers are among the most social, everyone knows.
 Larzanda: Is this discord_
 Larzanda:&#160;?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i used targ3-vel, but didnt make it to gold
 Rodrigo_the_coder: fck this sht i'm out
 Larzanda: o.O
 Rodrigo_the_coder: hey ClockSort
 ATaco: o/
 RicksMLC: o7
 RicksMLC: ATaco
 RicksMLC: trying to find you in the leaderboard
 DaNinja: miszu make NODE_POOL_SIZE a power of 2 then you can do index &amp; 0x1fff instead of modulo division
 miszu: Thanks DaNinja I will keep that in mind when doing optimizations
 sittle: hi all
 CatSish: Hi

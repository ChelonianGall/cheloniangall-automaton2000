 SquidXTV: can I set somewhere that when I enter a Clash of Code round, the code comments are automatically left out?
 slazure: new record
 slazure: 15 seconds per clash of code
 MingoVanBurne: proof?
 slazure: wdym
 slazure: how do i send u proof
 slazure: i got it
 slazure: and whatever i say is true
 slazure:&#160;:)
 slazure: so you want me to send screenshot
 MingoVanBurne: I believe you
 MingoVanBurne: but when you complete a clash, you can click the share button and it will give you a link
 slazure: ok
 slazure: ill do it

 jacek: oO
 jacek: huh, atari go 9x9 and atari go is exactly the same?
 jacek: except the bigger size on later leagues
 simpu: uh! Hi
 jacek: ohai
 jacek: first ~45 frames, is this ladder? oO <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/599902632">https://www.codingame.com/replay/599902632</a>
 MSmits: think someone is trying to prove their masculinity through go :P
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits, been a while dude, how are ya?
 jacek: i think ill stop trolling this year
 Astrobytes: *this* year
 darkhorse64: ¨
 darkhorse64: ^
 DevOops: jacek: Yes, it's a ladder.
 Astrobytes: Jacek's Ladder
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits is online. hey, haven't seen you in a while :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: hi to the rest as well of course
 MSmits: hey guys
 MSmits: yeah been busy with work, but have been working on meta mcts and stuff still. Just not been active on chat
 MSmits: I've been upgrading some meta mcts programs with the optimistic/pessimistic bounds principle. It's quite good
 MSmits: (ab pruning for mcts)
 jacek: c4 solved yet?
 Astrobytes: nice!
 Astrobytes: and hi euler&#160;:)
 DevOops: jacek: Yes, 7x6 connect4 is solved.
 MSmits: no, I don't think it's feasible. I went over 100 million nodes now. It seems solved as a win for p1 as the values are only dropping for p2 for the last 50 million nodes or so, but i think the tree is too deep to be solved by mcts
 MSmits: at least for my 2 billion node limit
 MSmits: I get an issue when i get too deep in some branches
 MSmits: all nodes give 100% wr and it doesnt know which to explore
 MSmits: so it takes huge amounts of visits
 MSmits: so it works as a meta mcts in terms of finding the best moves, but proving the win means it's gonna equally visit all those 100% win branches till one solves
 MSmits: where 1 of them would suffice...
 Astrobytes: (I've missed these sermons)
 MSmits: minimax + ab would not have this issue
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you lost me again&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: voting smits for mod
 MSmits: minimax is DFS is what I meant, my mcts turns into a BFS because of the equal visits at 100% wr
 Astrobytes: yeah, lets recommend him
 MSmits: DFS solves faster as it's clearly a won branch
 Astrobytes: well, it's the pruning that helps in that case
 MSmits: not for mcts
 aileth: hello guys im new here and i started c lang weeks ago just wondering do you guys know any where that i can learn more about c 
 Astrobytes: I meant for minimax DFS
 MSmits: ah yeah, it does
 MSmits: pes/opt bounds doesn't help there
 MSmits: because they are only for solved values
 eulerscheZahl: shouldn't mcts solver also handle this?
 MSmits: only for solved nodes
 MSmits: but it can only get to a solved node if it explores deep enough
 DevOops: Where can I read about the max size for the source code? 
 MSmits: but it explores all nodes equally because of 100% wr
 MSmits: so thats taking forever
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you cut search before reaching the end?
 eulerscheZahl: 100k chars is the max size
 MSmits: meta mcts starts a game at a leaf
 eulerscheZahl: i see, interesting
 MSmits: so it keeps starting games that go deeper and deeper until one of those game solves on the first turn
 MSmits: then the leaf is a solved node
 MSmits: so it's a mcts solver that starts mcts solver games
 jacek: youre not reusing some of the knowledge from the sims?
 eulerscheZahl: my head starts hurting again, this vaccination has no chill&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: oh damn, side effects again huh
 MSmits: yeah i do, i put all the played moves from the "sim" game into the meta tree
 MSmits: sucks eulerscheZahl, they last only a day for me, at least on 2nd dose
 eulerscheZahl: but much better than yesterday already
 MSmits: will get 3rd on friday next week
 Astrobytes: oh that's good news 
 MSmits: booster side effects are worse?
 MSmits: supposedly you make a lot more antibodies the third time
 eulerscheZahl: same-ish
 MSmits: i guess if the body works harder you might feel worse?
 Astrobytes: I've got the invitation but need to make an appointment, last time I was there the queue was all the way outside the hospital, and halfway round the car park - mostly unmasked, no ditancing
 Astrobytes: *distancing
 eulerscheZahl: and i got moderna this time vs biontech, so not totally comparable
 MSmits: kinda defeats the purpose Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 MSmits: makes no sense either. These people aren't antivax idiots so you would expect them to mask up..
 Astrobytes: hopefully will be less busy over the next few weeks
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you'd have thought so
 eulerscheZahl: some might be, getting harder to do what you want without vaccination
 MSmits: hmm that's true
 MSmits: it'll be hard to defend forcing people to vaccinate if it doesn't work for omicron and delta is gone
 MSmits: let's hope it works at least somewhat
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I mean I get the whole civil liberties thing, but people are dying...
 Astrobytes: True
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://netherlandsnewslive.com/man-behind-jaikwilcorona-arrested-website-taken-offline-inland-3/306833/">https://netherlandsnewslive.com/man-behind-jaikwilcorona-arrested-website-taken-offline-inland-3/306833/</a>
 MSmits: yep idiots in every country :P
 Astrobytes: what's that weird ikwilhakke word
 MSmits: jaikwilcorona translates to yesiwantcorona
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: omicron is sweet.  like a very mild cold
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: never slept better in my life
 MSmits: it is for you, try not to draw conclusions based on a dataset of 1
 MSmits: thats why scientists are so careful saying anythign definitive on omicron even though they have thousands of datapoints
 MSmits: beats your 1
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: i realized that i can mostly understand dutch, at least in writing
 MSmits: same for me with German, it's close enough
 Astrobytes: I can only say ik wil hakke
 eulerscheZahl: ich will haben
 MSmits: if you mean ik wil hak, that's a vegetable brand
 MSmits: not sure what you mean by hakke
 jacek: yeah MSmits, its like concluding that p1 wins after 1 simulation
 MSmits: solved it!
 ninjadip: hello fellow coders
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: no no, I want to chop, might be ik wil hakken
 MSmits: yes thats correct
 MSmits: hi ninjadip
 MSmits: why do you want to chop?
 Astrobytes: Old gabber record from the 90s, became a meme within the scene
 ninjadip: how do u send those red messages?
 MSmits: ohh hakken, i get it now
 MSmits: like this ninjadip
 MSmits: it goes red when your name is in it&#160;:)
 ninjadip: ohhhhh
 ninjadip: automatic
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: also easy to type someones name if you finish with tab
 ninjadip: sweeet, it's all coming together
 MSmits: ms+tab and you have my name
 MSmits: (probably)
 ninjadip: cool again, ty
 ninjadip: it came up MSAnderson
 MSmits: ah yes, thats why i said probably&#160;:)
 MSmits: reminds me of the matrix
 jacek: btw MSmits some online mnist based on cnn suffers from my 0 too <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ZWXg5Vv.png">https://i.imgur.com/ZWXg5Vv.png</a>
 MSmits: haha
 MSmits: thats great
 jacek: probably because the circle is the upper half and it expects that line below
 ninjadip: so are there like the same ten people that will be in my world chat everytime
 MSmits: i tested it a lot at my school btw, it did very well
 MSmits: Astrobytes did you try my mnist thingy?
 Astrobytes: I don't believe I am aware of it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/python/c2d8e7cce8?outputOnly=true">https://trinket.io/python/c2d8e7cce8?outputOnly=true</a>
 MSmits: drag the dot
 MSmits: and use space bar
 Astrobytes: 3 == 7 :tada:
 MSmits: I trained it locally on mnist data and then put it into a trinket, everythign is drawn with python turtle
 ninjadip: oh that's cool!
 MSmits: damn it always does 3's for me
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/AW1koiP">https://imgur.com/a/AW1koiP</a>
 MSmits: I think i trained myself to draw in a way it always guesses correctly :P
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Wont was complaining his 0's kept coming out as 3 or 9
 Astrobytes: I deliberately made it a wonky 3, still a 3 though
 ZarthaxX: that thing is missing a bit too much MSmits :sweat:
 MSmits: yeah it does for some people
 MSmits: not sure why
 MSmits: could be because they are not handdrawn
 Astrobytes: 3 == 5, getting closer!
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: lol thats not how closer works :P
 MSmits: draw a 2
 MSmits: 2 never failed for me anyways
 ZarthaxX: happy new year everyone whenever it happens in your country 
 ZarthaxX: lets try 2 then
 MSmits: thanks ZarthaxX you too
 Astrobytes: and you ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: it worked! :O
 MSmits: yay 
 ZarthaxX: you teaching NNs to kids now?
 MSmits: btw, locally it has 97% accuracy
 MSmits: on the data + test
 ZarthaxX: wow nice
 MSmits: yeah so it is not bad, but it is made a lot worse when combined with the drawing process
 MSmits: it's not easy to turn a pixel drawn image into correct input
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: good point
 MSmits: btw, not exactly teaching them NN, just the general principles
 ZarthaxX: it's still a lot
 ZarthaxX: are they getting the concepts?
 Astrobytes: Er...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/VHb5BIU">https://imgur.com/a/VHb5BIU</a>
 MSmits: some are, i only did it 1 time and i didnt include mnist then
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: ah okie
 MSmits: it's too small
 ZarthaxX: btw MSmits do you know graphviz?
 Astrobytes: that's what she said
 MSmits: thats the problem with drawing on the screen, you have too much room
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 MSmits: lol
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: 3% problem
 MSmits: let me check graphviz, maybe 
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html</a>
 ZarthaxX: found it while reading some MCTS papers
 MSmits: i think someone may have suggested it to me, could have been you
 MSmits: so it makes graphs from text?
 ZarthaxX: mhmm i recommended another one
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.674.6547&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.674.6547&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
 ZarthaxX: yeah look at that paper
 ZarthaxX: the graphs in there were generated by it
 ZarthaxX: it's just for visualizing how the tree lkooks roughly
 ZarthaxX: not really detailed
 MSmits: ohh it has an oware board
 ZarthaxX: well, that's what i think
 ZarthaxX: ah yeah mancala
 ZarthaxX: seems like oware
 MSmits: cool stuff
 MSmits: yeah oware is a mancala type game
 Astrobytes: Is it just me?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/JFMcr3r">https://imgur.com/a/JFMcr3r</a>
 MSmits: too large
 ZarthaxX: your 2s are ugly astro
 MSmits: you're drawing on the edge
 MSmits: none of the training examples had 2's on the edge i guess
 Astrobytes: FFS it doesn't exactly come with a manual
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: "Please ensure your 2 matches  something from the training dataset"
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: yes thats how nn's work dont they :P
 ZarthaxX: you should already know how it works smartrobyto
 ZarthaxX: smastrobyto*
 ZarthaxX: that sounds cooler
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: missed to come up with names of u astro
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/bz9N5qq">https://imgur.com/a/bz9N5qq</a>
 MSmits: first one i just tried
 ZarthaxX: nice
 ZarthaxX: he cheated! he is the dev
 MSmits: i really do think i trained myself to make it work
 MSmits: they are almost always correct when i do it
 ZarthaxX: thats good, you can do an online demonstration and everyone will believe it works
 Astrobytes: I got 2 = 8... not touching the edges
 traagel: here's a mask for you&#160;: 255.255.255.254
 MSmits: exactly ZarthaxX&#160;:)
 <b>**eulerscheZahl knows graphviz</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: FINALLY
 jacek: mancala eh
 jacek: and i think struct knows graphviz
 Astrobytes: It seems you have to draw it at almost exactly the font size of the output...
 MSmits: yeah thats the trick i think
 ZarthaxX: hey toad
 MSmits: this is because you're much more constricted in terms of size when doing the handdrawings
 ZarthaxX: have you used that thing?
 Astrobytes: hmph, now it thinks my 8 is a 3
 Astrobytes: Good effort though :D
 MSmits: also lines could be more shaky when using the dot
 jacek: "However, as we willdemonstrate, when a board evaluation heuristic is available,it is much better to propagate information backwards usinga Minimax style update rule"
 jacek: so... jacekmax?
 MSmits: compared to handdrawing
 ZarthaxX: i think so jacek 
 ZarthaxX: you have the equation of the minimax update there
 MSmits: thanks Astrobytes, the hard part was for sure not the NN, just getting the drawing right and converting pixel coordinates to 28x28 input
 MSmits: i needed to use a ton of math to interpolate when a user draws fast, you get a dotted image instead of a line otherwise
 Astrobytes: interesting
 Astrobytes: Also: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/LN0NXde">https://imgur.com/a/LN0NXde</a>
 MSmits: well at least it think's there's a bit of a 8 in there :P
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: btw, if you look closely at the image you drew you'll see its 28x28 squares
 eulerscheZahl: suggestion to improve detection rate: instead of making us draw, we should be able to select among 10 predefined pictures
 MSmits: there\s actually a turtle drawing 784 squares with varying colors
 MSmits: 8 bit greyscale
 MSmits: thats what mnist nn needs
 MSmits: so your drawing is black but the result is greyscale
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl lol
 Astrobytes: yes, it's somewhat clear from viewing the output that it's greyscale... :P
 Astrobytes: euler :rofl:
 MSmits: ah yes but it goes from 1 bit to 255 bit
 MSmits: err 8 bit
 MSmits: 1 to 8
 MSmits: so it kinda does some distance calculation from where your dot has been and the center of each square to determine the color
 deeznutz1: guys can you help me with the thor code i dont know how to put the xy
 Astrobytes: MSmits: gotcha
 MSmits: what do you mean put the xy deeznutz1
 MSmits: (I have a feeling he was just trying to get me to say his name)
 Astrobytes: yeah, the average age in here these days seems to be about 9
 eulerscheZahl: another reason why i wasn't too keep on further playing the mod
 eulerscheZahl: keen*
 Astrobytes: same
 MSmits: I would not mind being mod btw, but I am not going to sit around all day watching chat. Just for times I am around to do something about it
 eulerscheZahl: i never watched the chat just to prevent spamming
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: lol, I don't think any of us ever sat around all day watching chat, better to watch paint drying
 MSmits: so both of you stopped being mod?:
 MSmits: who is still mod then?/
 eulerscheZahl: ille and neumann too
 Astrobytes: plus Neuman n and Ille
 Astrobytes: damn you :D
 MSmits: but there needs to be some mods though?
 Uljahn: sure
 Astrobytes: yes, there are still plenty
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/moderation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/moderation</a>
 Astrobytes: for now...
 eulerscheZahl: half of them are mostly inactive
 MSmits: did anything specific happen that set of a mod-exodus?
 Astrobytes: and 5DN1 L is a new addition
 MSmits: sounds like a virus
 orchidperson:  
 jacek: "Moderators have the trust of CodinGame's staff but we reserve ourselves the rights to revoke a moderator rights should any abuse occur"
 orchidperson: ds
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud suggested that we shoud quit if we are only on cg because of bot contests
 jacek: :thinking:
 orchidperson: fdf
 Astrobytes: (that's the condensed version at least)
 MSmits: quit being mod or quit completely?
 Astrobytes: mod
 MSmits: oh 
 MSmits: well you're not here just for bot contests, they were just very important
 MSmits: to you anyway euler, slightly less so for astro i think
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair i started the discussion by mentioning that i intend to quit if the next contest should be another escape
 eulerscheZahl: stated
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: no, started was correct
 eulerscheZahl: still tired
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: you will quit cg?
 Astrobytes: Nooo
 ZarthaxX: ah
 Astrobytes: We quit as mods
 ZarthaxX: yes i saw that
 ZarthaxX: the pay was not enough? :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: but i got more into topcoder recently
 Astrobytes: you can't get rid of us completely
 eulerscheZahl: and other marathon contests like codeforces
 ZarthaxX: oh no he is gonna beat tourist
 MSmits: He already did
 Astrobytes: that last game was fun, at least I know the format now
 ZarthaxX: so ACM-ICPC like contests or optimization ones?=
 MSmits: euler scored higher on the cooking contest :p
 ZarthaxX: MSmits wait what
 ZarthaxX: ah lol
 Astrobytes: optim
 ZarthaxX: makes sense then
 Astrobytes: (only ones I'm interested in at least)
 ZarthaxX: +1 to that
 MSmits: you only like optims Astrobytes?
 MSmits: I like them ok, but they're not my favorites
 ZarthaxX: toad i need to find a thesis theme D:
 ZarthaxX: it's gonna be hard
 MSmits: a subject?
 ZarthaxX: topic*
 Astrobytes: no, in the context of topcoder-style contests
 ZarthaxX: yeah sorry lol
 MSmits: oh ok, because a theme would be like christmas, or summer :P
 ZarthaxX: or i can just search for current offers
 ZarthaxX: yeah i just translated wrongly from spanish
 MSmits: got it
 MSmits: i do it all the time from Dutch, but only Astrobytes notices
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YymAKif">https://imgur.com/a/YymAKif</a>
 MSmits: cuz he's a native
 ZarthaxX: i wonder if some AI thing could be done as a thesis subject but well
 ZarthaxX: what's that haha
 MSmits: christmas themed thesis
 Astrobytes: that was the topcoder optim
 Astrobytes: Stop the Elves
 ZarthaxX: MSmits hahaha
 ZarthaxX: oh nice
 MSmits: wait, did they provide this visualization or did eulerscheZahl get creative again?
 Astrobytes: no it came with a viewer
 ZarthaxX: i would go for the second
 ZarthaxX: oh
 MSmits: just seems like something euler would do
 Astrobytes: flawed but useable
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903337608606789755/921811360722087946/lvl2.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903337608606789755/921811360722087946/lvl2.png</a>
 MSmits: whats that
 Astrobytes: ^ euler's local visualisation
 eulerscheZahl: i added those small boxes it visualize my plan
 MSmits: aha
 eulerscheZahl: but topcoder has some nice visuals too, at least sometimes
 MSmits: oh i am confused with codeforces
 MSmits: they are lazy on the visuals i think
 eulerscheZahl: the idea is to protect the presents against fraudulent elves
 eulerscheZahl: as many of them as you can at least
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: those are the worst kind of elves
 eulerscheZahl: then circle shows some presents surrounded by as few boxes as possible
 Astrobytes: elf fraud is a big thing nowadays
 jacek: and troll
 eulerscheZahl: used max flow min cut theorem
 MSmits: nice, i am not that knowledgable about graph stuff, apart from decision trees
 Astrobytes: with very readable source code too, it was like reading a manual or something
 eulerscheZahl: you really read that thing?
 MSmits: some people read manuals
 MSmits: weird i know
 eulerscheZahl: i shared my code on a private discord after the event
 Astrobytes: Sure, always interesting to look at (non-CP-style) code from others
 MSmits: ohh it was your code that's the manual?
 Astrobytes: I mean it was technical but easy to read
 eulerscheZahl: found a stream is the last tco finals. psyho was coding in notepad++
 MSmits: euler is a pro
 eulerscheZahl: is-&gt;of
 MSmits: notepad++ is not good?
 Astrobytes: at least it wasn't just notepad
 MSmits: I mean VS trumps all anyways
 BlaiseEbuth: Pwet here
 eulerscheZahl: i was expecting more of an IDE
 MSmits: maybe because it's not an IDE it's faster?
 eulerscheZahl: vs, vs code, clion, ...even codeblocks
 MSmits: i tried codeblocks, horrified me
 eulerscheZahl: same
 MSmits: i am spoiled by vs
 Astrobytes: yeah, never got on with that
 Astrobytes: and yep, VS is so nice and comfortable
 MSmits: vs code was ok, but i screw up on the packages and such
 BlaiseEbuth: codeblock... Remind me school TD...
 eulerscheZahl: i mostly use vs code on my personal pc these days
 MSmits: not those blocks&#160;:)
 MSmits: btw i will be working with  microbit soon
 MSmits: have to practice  with it
 MSmits: students will do some physical computing stuff
 Astrobytes: I use vscode for anything that isn't C++/C#/C
 eulerscheZahl: they are so small that you can fit more of them in your opening book
 MSmits: python too?
 Astrobytes: microbit?
 BlaiseEbuth: I use vscode for everything now...
 Astrobytes: Yeah MSmits
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://microbit.org/">https://microbit.org/</a>
 MSmits: i use pycharm i think
 MSmits: but only for nn stuff
 Astrobytes: gotcha, nice! Have you tried it out yet?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I only write little things in python mostly so vscode is fine for now
 MSmits: nope, it's been sitting in a drawer while i grade 40 websites. 14 more to go and the microbit is last on my list
 BlaiseEbuth: I prefer having a unique tool. Same UI for all.
 Astrobytes: good for workflow I guess
 MSmits: makes sense BlaiseEbuth but I dont think VS is that good for python
 Uljahn: anaconda + vscode is a nice combo
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't really use python though...
 MSmits: oh i have anaconda for all that TF crap
 eulerscheZahl: isn't anaconda a commercial product?
 MSmits: there's free versions
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: I used jupyter once . . . 
 BlaiseEbuth: And packages allows you to really improve your experience, whatever the language.
 MSmits: people seem to like jupyter for nn stuff
 MSmits: i run into it a lot
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I just don't like the workflow, I find it clunky
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: probably it just takes getting used to
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the only MS product I'll ever say good things about. :p
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 BlaiseEbuth: WDYM by workflow?
 MSmits: wait jupyter is MS?
 Astrobytes: No, he means VSCode
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: have you heard about VS Codium?
 MSmits: i always used to open the referees for contests in VS code
 MSmits: nope euler
 Astrobytes: workflow as in how easy/efficient/comfortable it is to accomplish common tasks 
 eulerscheZahl: it's like chrome vs chromium
 MSmits: Astrobytes means to keep going without getting stuck on stuff that shouldn not be  a problem
 Astrobytes: community-built?
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Well at start I wasn't comfortable, but you get used to.
 BlaiseEbuth: I looked into it eulerscheZahl, but not convinced.
 MSmits: doesnt normal vs code already have a ton of community input?
 MSmits: with all the packages and such?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just disabling the telemetry
 MSmits: telemetry?
 Astrobytes: sending data back home to MS
 MSmits: it does that in a mandatory fashion?
 MSmits: cant you turn that off?
 BlaiseEbuth: Not totally.
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Astrobytes: it IS MS we speak about
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: still some telemetry left in .net itself iirc
 MSmits: MS pisses me off a lot
 MSmits: it used to be you could have windows and not be forced into an update
 eulerscheZahl: they got better
 BlaiseEbuth: And since the telemetry is added by ms at compile time, they just build their version from the official repo.
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you don't use windows
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i still hate windows, but other products like vs code or .net framework a fine with me
 MSmits: I like windows when it's not forcing me to update
 BlaiseEbuth: But they also change the packages repo, and I'm not really confident in it... 
 Astrobytes: I think I'll use my linux box for the next topcoder marathon tbh
 MSmits: what is perceived as the main problem with windows btw?
 eulerscheZahl: it's inefficient to use
 MSmits: system resources?
 eulerscheZahl: do you know i3wm? takes time to learn but so much faster
 eulerscheZahl: no windows hiding behind each other so that you have to find them again
 MSmits: ok so you mean efficient in terms of workflow?
 Astrobytes: the tiling tool?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: to both
 Astrobytes: yeah I know it
 MSmits: ah ok, it's pretty efficient for me, i was more worried about system resources tbh
 eulerscheZahl: there is bug.n for windows. but it felt laggy to me
 BlaiseEbuth: And also too blackbox-ish.
 Astrobytes: I tried it out yeah, not very good on windows
 BlaiseEbuth: When is the next topcoder marathon&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: mid january
 eulerscheZahl: 12.01 Wed 19:00: MM 13209.02 Wed 19:00: MM 13316.03 Wed 18:00: MM 134
 eulerscheZahl: 7 days duration each
 Astrobytes: is there a date for RAIC yet btw?
 eulerscheZahl: unknown to me
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. Never tried a topcoder one. What kind of subject is it?
 eulerscheZahl: optim problem
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YymAKif">https://imgur.com/a/YymAKif</a>
 eulerscheZahl: protect the gifts from randomly spawning elves
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh great. It's been a long time since I've made one.
 eulerscheZahl: they get pretty creative with their tasks sometimes
 Astrobytes: that was my first TC marathon
 MSmits: randomly spawning?
 MSmits: seems weird for an optim
 MSmits: usually not much random
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/wleite/status/1440736696463597582">https://twitter.com/wleite/status/1440736696463597582</a>
 Astrobytes: with a certain probability per map
 eulerscheZahl: for topcoder random is normal. but 2000 testcases for a final rerun
 MSmits: wait so the presents are chickens now?
 eulerscheZahl: other optim contest
 eulerscheZahl: catch the chickens
 MSmits: I see
 BlaiseEbuth: February for RAIC iirc.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/wleite/status/1357684154981355520">https://twitter.com/wleite/status/1357684154981355520</a> candy crush
 Astrobytes: and there are postmortems too, often with code, just don't try to read that code, far too traumatic
 MSmits: yeah the problem with CG post mortems is that people dont give code because of it becoming a multi
 eulerscheZahl: if they don't forget about it, topcoder makes all submissions public after the event
 MSmits: it's nice for learning purposes
 Astrobytes: MSmits: this isn't :rofl:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/FakePsyho/cpcontests/blob/master/topcoder/mm131/StopTheElves.cpp">https://github.com/FakePsyho/cpcontests/blob/master/topcoder/mm131/StopTheElves.cpp</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: VVPII :thinking:
 MSmits: no, you need someone to go through the submissions from rank 1 down and find a few that are readable and share a list&#160;:)
 MSmits: would be fun if euler's is the first on that list
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/FakePsyho/cpcontests/blob/master/topcoder/mm131/StopTheElves.cpp">https://github.com/FakePsyho/cpcontests/blob/master/topcoder/mm131/StopTheElves.cpp</a>...damn you Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: heading to the shops, afk for a bit
 MSmits: cya Astrobytes
 jacek: :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°)╯︵&#160;:)
 jacek: we're leaving together
 eulerscheZahl: astro killed the chat
 ninjadip: what cat
 eulerscheZahl: the cat with an h in it
 jacek: Automaton2000 want something to say?
 Automaton2000: i mean a lot of room to improve
 jacek: Automaton2000 where is AutomatonNN?&#160;:(
 Automaton2000: i'll find a way to use a nn to find the shortest path
 jacek: Automaton2000 yes. find him
 Automaton2000: i guess this is what happens
 Astrobytes: Jeez, what a boring bunch :D
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: it's just boring without you Astrobytes
 MSmits: I can't do sermons when you aren't here, people see cats where there aren't any and as a last resort, they turn to the chat bots
 NlcknameAlreadyTaken: :pouting_cat:
 Astrobytes: hahaha, brilliant
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: hey struct&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: our mod spy, let us know if anything interesting is about to happen
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: speaking of CG, where's Julien these days? Didn't see him on discord for what seems like forever
 eulerscheZahl: maybe he got bored and left the discord server too
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: btw do you still see me as the author of my old messages or just some deleted user?
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even take a full day after me leaving that i got a private message related to CG SDK :D
 Astrobytes: still as you
 Astrobytes: As if you were still a member that is
 eulerscheZahl: i was nice enough to reply that i have no idea about the quirks of the latest version with the pixi update
 eulerscheZahl: seems that new entities aren't placed on top anymore but random if you don't assign a zIndex
 Astrobytes: yes I saw that recently
 Astrobytes: At least that channel still makes some degree of sense
 eulerscheZahl: could actually be circumvented with the SDK. just set zIndex to big factor * user-assigned z + entity ID
 Astrobytes: I'm sure someone will figure that out eventually :P
 eulerscheZahl: i think it would be a simple-enough change to the SDK to get back old behaviour
 eulerscheZahl: and spellcheck always makes me realize that i'm inconsistent
 eulerscheZahl: i write color, neighbor but behaviour
 Astrobytes: and realize instead of realise
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: not what my english teachers tried to teach me
 struct: isn't color also correct?
 Astrobytes: realise is the UK spelling, same with adding a 'u' to the aforementioned
 Astrobytes: depends if you follow American or British English conventions
 struct: I follow subtitles
 Astrobytes: :D
 traagel: Do not try and bend the spoon—that’s impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.
 eulerscheZahl: uri geller would disagree
 Astrobytes: hah! Uri Geller :rofl:
 Astrobytes: last time I heard of him he was telepathically trying to prevent the UK PM from leaving the EU
 eulerscheZahl: ah, successful as always
 Astrobytes: He never fails :D
 eulerscheZahl: there was an evening show on german television once (2-3h duration) where he tried to get in contact with aliens
 Astrobytes: hahaha!
 eulerscheZahl: didn't watch it myself but read later that he failed and it was a boring evening
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller_Live:_Ufos_und_Aliens_%E2%80%93_Das_unglaubliche_TV-Experiment">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller_Live:_Ufos_und_Aliens_%E2%80%93_Das_unglaubliche_TV-Experiment</a>
 Astrobytes: It would have been highly amusing if he succeeded tbh, Uri Geller - Intergalactic Ambassador of Earth
 Astrobytes: 'Under hypnosis, Geller claimed he was sent to Earth by extraterrestrials from a spaceship 53,000 light years away.[36][37] Geller later denied the space fantasy claims, but affirmed there "is a slight possibility that some of my energies do have extraterrestrial connection."' :rofl:
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Astrobytes: (from EN wikipedia)
 eulerscheZahl: 53000, i didn't know that he is that old :o
 jacek: people mixing years and light years :unamused:
 jacek: where are the physics teachers when you need one
 eulerscheZahl: at least that contradicts the Bible according to which the earth is 5000 years old. so at least he doesn't believe in that, it's something
 eulerscheZahl: light year = takes light a year to travel that distance
 Astrobytes: Finally, credibility for Uri Geller
 eulerscheZahl: so even if the space ship is super fast, it is in fact 53000 years
 jacek: something something time dilation
 Astrobytes: I bet his ship travelled at warp-factor Geller
 jacek: but also wormholes or other space-time bending
 Astrobytes: And ofc his ship was shaped like a spoon.
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://preview.redd.it/mife10tcm7701.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=911433a07c3398dbbbe65f218b971c1bedccdb69">https://preview.redd.it/mife10tcm7701.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=911433a07c3398dbbbe65f218b971c1bedccdb69</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, it's new year's eve. completely forgot
 Astrobytes: I didn't... the shops were a nightmare
 eulerscheZahl: so far it's quiet in my neighborhood
 eulerscheZahl: no explosions
 jacek: no money to burn
 eulerscheZahl: sales of fireworks are forbidden for the 2nd year in a row
 eulerscheZahl: usage as well but obviously people don't care
 Astrobytes: It'll be like a warzone here by 10pm. And they'll let off fireworks too :P
 MSmits: hey, you're talking physics without me
 eulerscheZahl: *boom*never mind my last statement
 MSmits: any unresolved physics issues&#160;?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: why are fireworks sales forbidden this year?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: time is a social construct
 Automaton2000: but i had to turn it on
 eulerscheZahl: no, i acknowledge defeat to jacek
 Astrobytes: jacek wanted explanations about time dilation and wormholes
 eulerscheZahl: because of the pandemic
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh brother
 MSmits: oh ok specifically if there is time dilation near a wormhole?
 Astrobytes: and space-time distortions
 Astrobytes: *and other
 MSmits: oh btw, I am actually unsure if anything ever fell into a black hole because of time dilation
 eulerscheZahl: * reduce odds of larger group gatherings
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you can always do that Godel closed timelike curve thing
 MSmits: they always talk about stuff going into black holes, but it takes an infinite amount of time, as seen from an outside observer
 eulerscheZahl: personally i'm just happy when it remains silent. i want to sleep at night and my cat easily panics
 MSmits: which means from our perspective, nothing has ever fallen in
 jacek: no spaghettization?
 MSmits: oh yes that still happens, it just takes a long time
 MSmits: but stuff doesnt actually go over the event horizon
 MSmits: it just gets nearer
 MSmits: forever
 MSmits: asymptotically
 Astrobytes: that's even worse than ending up in it
 MSmits: kinda yeah, also i have to add that from the person falling into's perspective, he just falls in normally
 MSmits: it's just while he is falling in, the entire universe ends
 eulerscheZahl: i really recommend Futurama to you MSmits. have you watched it already?
 MSmits: because an infintie amount of time will pass from the universe's perspectiv
 MSmits: nope, you have recommended it before though
 eulerscheZahl: and i'll do it again
 MSmits: i might if it shows up on a streaming service
 eulerscheZahl: it also contains a hypnotoad
 MSmits: like netflix or prime or disney
 Astrobytes: Futurama is awesome, you'll like it MSmits
 MSmits: I'm convinced
 eulerscheZahl: and lots of jokes that you only get if you pause the video
 MSmits: because they take a bit of time?
 MSmits: sounds like easter eggs
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.simonsingh.net/Simpsons_Mathematics/simpsorama/">https://www.simonsingh.net/Simpsons_Mathematics/simpsorama/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: most of the Futurama authors even have a degree in maths or physics before they switched to comedy
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: has the TSP in there&#160;:)
 jacek: i think there was some proof made for episode
 Astrobytes: small details/jokes embedded in Simpsons and Futurama since the dawn of each series
 MSmits: I could never get into simpsons
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://theinfosphere.org/Futurama_theorem">https://theinfosphere.org/Futurama_theorem</a>
 Astrobytes: *visual jokes
 jacek: that reminds me of stargate episode when they switched bodies
 MSmits: ah yeah 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: do other countries make funny cartoons we never hear about in the US?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: that cartoon about the penis man
 MSmits: someone has the link?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I mean like a series...
 MSmits: it's actually for kids
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: that's what i mean
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3sGocnMP3A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3sGocnMP3A</a>
 jacek: funny cartoons not made by us?
 Astrobytes: John Dillermand
 eulerscheZahl: there was a simpsons episode where Apu said the 20000th digit of pi as proof of his memory. one simpson author asked a friend at NASA to use their super computer and compute it so it's correct
 MSmits: haha yes thats it
 Astrobytes: Danish cartoon to teach kids good values
 jacek: 20000th digit pi is not much, even in 1990
 MSmits: maybe too much for a private cpu
 MSmits: yeah i think so, i was 9 then
 MSmits: if i remember what our first pc was like... years later
 jacek: " And on the witness stand, he reveals he knows the number pi to 400,000 digits. "The last number is one," he says."
 eulerscheZahl: oh, 400k my bad
 jacek: where did euler get 20000 from :thinking:
 MSmits: same order of magnitude :P
 jacek: 20k vs 400k?
 MSmits: well almost
 struct: the last number of the 400k is 1?
 MSmits: whats another factor of 20 :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: hey, I have the perfect contrib for that
 MSmits: for john dillermand?
 jacek: if it were that easy, you should jump straight from 7x6 to 9x7 by now
 eulerscheZahl: i saw a paper by Hoare about quicksort efficiency once. he compared with merge sort and estimated the runtime for 5k values as he didn't have enough RAM
 Pisik: hi
 MSmits: eh no, 7x6 times 20 is not 9x7, try times 20,000
 MSmits: or so
 MSmits: 7x6 takes me an hour or less
 MSmits: I have months of calc time into 9x7
 eulerscheZahl: i really admire your passion
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 jacek: and you havent started solving nine men morris?
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder is great for me: 1 week and then it's over
 MSmits: i havent finished writing the code jacek, but i have the index function of 9mm, so the hardest part is done
 MSmits: as soon as i get bored with oware again, 9mm gets finished
 MSmits: still going to make a nn for that
 MSmits: (both of those)
 jacek: :sleeping:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: You guys need to help the new mods, they are afraid to ban and the 13yos are running all over them
 MSmits: i dont know if they will be any good, it will depend on how nn trained on solved values compare with the azero method
 Astrobytes: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: Not my problem any more :D
 MSmits: it's not just a problem, it's also a solution
 MSmits: having mod powers means you can get rid of annoyances
 MSmits: well... some of them
 Astrobytes: I don't get annoyed, I just chuckle about it
 MSmits: hmm ok, some people really get annoyed
 MSmits: I think it's annoying when they disrupt a conversation, otherwise it doesnt bother me
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I always thought there was just one 13yo who kept respawning, but I guess there are a bunch of them
 Astrobytes: The webchat has been hysterically bad the past few weeks. And the discord...
 MSmits: how was the discord?
 jacek: discord, as the name implies...
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: Spammy kids everywhere talking nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: i've already left discord as it annoyed me too much
 MSmits: i thought discord had more activity than this webchat
 eulerscheZahl: was always low on activity
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: then they added even more channels to it
 MSmits: yeah, but thats a problem for any discord i've been on, always too many channels
 eulerscheZahl: when you have more channels than active users, something is wrong
 Astrobytes: there's been a significant degradation in quality of conversation the past few weeks
 MSmits: until today
 eulerscheZahl: share that christmas poem
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: who wrote a poem?/
 eulerscheZahl: some newbie user
 MSmits: is it any good?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a prime example of degrading quality
 BlaiseEbuth: Share it.
 MSmits: i see, so earlier poems were better?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's the first of that kind
 eulerscheZahl: i left so i dont have access
 MSmits: ok so we're talking about a pioneer&#160;?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/M54y02a">https://imgur.com/a/M54y02a</a>
 MSmits: seems like rap lyrics
 BlaiseEbuth: Bot poem
 Astrobytes: that's in the main codingame channel, not even the talk about anything one
 MSmits: i cant judge the quality of those, they're all equally crap to me :p\
 Astrobytes: anyway, afk, cooking
 MSmits: ah, years since i last cooked anything
 eulerscheZahl: afk eating see you
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: see because i dont need to cook to get sustenance, i can do more sermons jacek
 jacek: sure, why not
 jacek: if this keeps you alive
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: normally i eat some stuff in addition to the nutrition shakes, but trying to lose a little weight, so these last 2 weeks it's been just the shakes
 MSmits: 2k calories is a little low, so it works
 jacek: use intermittent fasting [solved]
 MSmits: nah, no need, just not buying a bag of popcorn every other day is simple enough
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: when the smallpox hits this year we'll all lose weight
 MSmits: i think you mistake us for an anti-vaxx bubble :P
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: huh? smallpox vax works really well
 MSmits: yeah, so we wont lose weight&#160;:)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: if you can get it, sure
 MSmits: ohh right this is one of those vaccines people dont get automatically
 MSmits: i forget which diseases are included
 Husoski: Is anyone still vaxxing for smallpox?  I was 'cause I'm that old, but I don't think my kids were.  It's too long gone.
 MSmits: yeah apparently it is
 MSmits: too long gone
 MSmits: polio and measles still do though
 jacek: anither extinct species&#160;:(
 MSmits: i think more new viruses are made than go extinct :P
 MSmits: animals natural habitats reduce
 Husoski: So was anthrax, except that military labs kept it for bio-weaponry...makes one wonder
 MSmits: virus natural habitats increase
 MSmits: I'm sure lots of stuff gets kept in labs and are made. You just dont need labs to make deadly viruses. They happen naturally
 MSmits: it's weird how some people are more quick to assume a new virus comes from a lab than from a natural origin, even though the natural way happens extremely often
 MSmits: The whole world is one massive lab
 MSmits: can't compete with that
 Husoski: I was wondering if smallpox was still in a lab somewhere, not speculating about SARS-COV-2
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: The FDA approved a new smallpox vaccine last year, specifically in case bad guys pull it out of a lab.  Tembexa
 Husoski: Interesting.  Sure sound like USA has it on hand then, and suspects that someone else might too?
 Astrobytes: I preferred the days when hallucinogenic substances used to escape from labs...
 Husoski: I remember those...or at least I think they're memories?
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 eulerscheZahl: looks like i'm late to the party<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v-U3K1sw9U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v-U3K1sw9U</a>
 MSmits: I wonder if I've seen that one before
 MSmits: I don't remember why you don't kiss pigs
 MSmits: watched the first 5 mins. I think i did see this one before
 Astrobytes: gotta love John Oliver
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i do, he always does those funny things just to annoy others. like the giant cake which was refused by the Guinness book, the rabbit book or the musical of insults 
 Astrobytes: lol, right :D
 MSmits: didnt he make a giant train thing for some town?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOt-lUUn3s4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOt-lUUn3s4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that must have been before i started watching him
 Astrobytes: hehehe awesome :D
 eulerscheZahl: great one
 eulerscheZahl: the world's largest model train track is in hamburg, germany btw
 eulerscheZahl: the Wunderland
 Astrobytes: yeah I've seen that
 Astrobytes: some dedication put into that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi6co_r1PfU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi6co_r1PfU</a>
 Astrobytes: oh wow
 Astrobytes: it's had an upgrade
 eulerscheZahl: they connected the neighboring building with a bridge as they ran out of space
 Astrobytes: incredible job on the Brazilian section
 Astrobytes: will they keep expanding? I hope so
 eulerscheZahl: video says that they will open new regions in 2022 and also have plans for the time after
 eulerscheZahl: took them 20 years to fill the first building, now they just started in the 2nd
 eulerscheZahl: with around 300 employees alread
 eulerscheZahl: y
 eulerscheZahl: my parents have seen it in person, were really impressed
 Astrobytes: Hm, I didn't catch that part. That's awesome. It's incredibly good and far bigger than the last time I saw it (not in person sadly).
 eulerscheZahl: currently they want realistic formula 1 races with overtaking and such. their old street design won't work there, so they designed their own chips to create magnetic fields for steering 
 Astrobytes: Haha! Now that's dedication, I like that
 eulerscheZahl: enough chatting for today. i blame the vaccine for being tired even sooner than usual&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Hehehe, see you later man, have a nice rest
 eulerscheZahl: and cat tells me to go to bed as well
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: so you go to bed now :older_man:
 eulerscheZahl: not before doing:

 Astrobytes: (of UK I mean)
 bool3: the start of the year is a saturdy
 bool3: thats a good sign

 Astrobytes: Humans are dumb.
 Cr4shOverride: New york is way ahead of you
 zakacat: haha, definitely 
 AmineACH51: Hello world
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Terrible start to the new year.  The PP size contrib has been rejected
 e_fishel: It was fair and square
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Yeah, I guess the testes cases needed more work
 e_fishel: no
 e_fishel: it's about the problem itself
 e_fishel: it's not about the test cases
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Fair enough.  If your rejection lasts more than four hours, please see a doctor
 jacek: oO
 Remus_: Doing Code Vs Zombies and debug logging makes my code pass, and fail without logging... I love timing bugs
 Astrobytes: you like bugs that involve timing issues or you actually like to time your bugs?
 jacek: :3
 Remus_: I like to time making bugs on days when I'm not in the mood of fixing them
 Astrobytes: gotta pass the time somehow I guess :D
 Remus_: masochism I guess
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: I guess it's after midnight or a war has begun in my area
 Remus_: war probably if you live in Ukraine
 Astrobytes: UK, close enough :rofl:
 Remus_: oh, flushing in debug print might fck the timing :joy:
 Remus_: just might
 Astrobytes: python?
 Remus_: yeah
 Astrobytes: yes it will
 Astrobytes: flush stdout 
 Astrobytes: or something
 Astrobytes: It's in the forum somewhere
 Remus_: now it fails consistently! reproducibility is nice
 Astrobytes: no wait, flush everything
 Astrobytes: Ugh, I'm confused
 jacek: its flushing automatically with endline
 Astrobytes: It's late, I've had a beer or two
 Astrobytes: on stderr?
 jacek: only two?
 Astrobytes: well, 6
 Remus_: those are rookie numbers
 Astrobytes: I'm Scottish, the night is only beginning, I am about to open my whisky
 Remus_: I've continued with whisky after 
 Astrobytes: Excellent choice&#160;:)
 jacek: no gin lovers?
 Remus_: Not scotch though, I've never tried that
 MSmits: noggin' lovers?
 Remus_: noggin?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.noggin.com/">https://www.noggin.com/</a>
 Remus_: This content is not available in your current location.rip
 MSmits: aww
 MSmits: I guess you can't learn with the characters you love then
 Astrobytes: noggin means your head here
 MSmits: who's head?
 Astrobytes: or like a small drink
 Astrobytes: My noggin is my head, your noggin is your head
 MSmits: sounds like the start of some excellent lyrics
 Astrobytes: Regarding whisky I do have a Scotch this year, a 10 yr old Glenmorangie gifted by a friend
 MSmits: I thought I'd lower the complexity of my humor, but you guys aren't drunk enough yet
 Astrobytes: Not my usual, but a great whisky
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 Astrobytes: I only start getting drunk now
 MSmits: ok good to know
 Astrobytes: *from now
 jacek: your humor?
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: more drink jacek
 jacek: or more weed
 MSmits: works
 MSmits: I'll do some more sermons about black holes if you do weed. You'll love it
 Remus_: I'm interested
 MSmits: good good
 Astrobytes: throw some mushrooms in there and he'll explain brane cosmology
 MSmits: earlier i was saying how nothing has ever fallen into a black hoke
 MSmits: hole
 MSmits: nah, I don't do branes
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: we could talk about dark matter and energy, and I could predictably say they are just made up nonsense
 Astrobytes: A black hoke
 Astrobytes: Brane-based theory is awesome though
 MSmits: wouldn't say made up nonsense, just names for holes in our knowledge
 MSmits: the word dark here just means unknown
 Astrobytes: ^ best reply ever
 jacek: dark energy is like bias in NN. it fills the gaps
 jacek: or matter
 Astrobytes: (off-topic a little but I have a Dark Energy II synthesiser)
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: does it expand your universe?
 Remus_: booo
 Astrobytes: It's a cool instrument, it expanded my sonic vocabulary
 Remus_: MSmits do you buy into the fuzzball stuff?
 MSmits: fuzzball, do you mean hairy black holes?
 MSmits: like information being stuck on the surface of a black hole?
 Astrobytes: Also got a Dark Time sequencer too, both analogue. Made in Germany by Doepfer
 MSmits: physicists don't really understand time, the prefix dark would be redundant
 Remus_: It's about black holes only having surface and they have no volume (no space-time in there as far as I understood it)
 Astrobytes: (it's just a name, it's a voltage based controller device)
 MSmits: yeah that's the geometry they have Remus_
 MSmits: it's the only thing that would make sense to me, if nothing has ever fallen into a black hole and it's completely disconnected from the rest of the universe, then the volume of it is meaningless
 Astrobytes: Things don't have to make sense...
 MSmits: That too, but it's a bonus
 MSmits: if they do
 Astrobytes: That's how we get more things to solve/investigate :D
 Astrobytes: yes true
 Remus_: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzball_(string_theory)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzball_(string_theory)</a>I was referring to this before
 MSmits: I just think it's really weird that these astrophysicists always talk about what would happen if you fell into a black hole when that's impossible
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I haven't kept up with physics lately.  Last I new the accelerators were about at the end of the roadmap, and string theory looked to be impossible to prove true or false
 jacek: it doesnt need to make sense. as long as it works...
 MrCalindo: happy new year everyone
 MSmits: it's like going faster than light, you can discuss that meaningfully either
 MSmits: it's outside possible physics given the laws
 Remus_: Happy new year!
 MSmits: can't
 MSmits: happy ny!
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I think it's more of a popularisation technique rather than a serious communication to other physicists
 jacek: new year? did we travel in time :thinking:
 MSmits: yeah but it bugs me because they also say in those documentaries that time slows to a standstill when you're falling in 
 MSmits: so while popularizing they make it sound like a paradox
 MSmits: when it's not
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's fair
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Gateway does it right I think
 Astrobytes: They should say it tends towards time standing still
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Fred Pohl
 Astrobytes: For one observer
 Remus_: so you can only fall onto a black hole (onto its surface, this might not be proper English though :grin:)
 MSmits: yeah, but more accurately, you will approach it asymptotically
 MSmits: it will evaporate before you ever hit the surface
 MSmits: because evaporation takes a finite time
 MSmits: and falling onto it takes in infinite amount of time
 MSmits: an
 Astrobytes: oh fuzzballs, gotcha now
 Remus_: wouldn't you also speed up as the mass decreases and its effect on time gets smaller?
 MSmits: well speeding up is kind of a very complicated statement when both velocity, the passage of time, the mass and the radius of the black hole change
 MSmits: both as in, all 4 of those things ( i thought of 2 more while tpying)
 DialFrost: strange how come my code golf rank isnt increasing
 Astrobytes: Isn't this different for the fuzzball model vs classical black hole?
 MSmits: not sure, i am not that knowledgable about string theory
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: did they ever figure out if a black hole can destroy information?
 MSmits: I think they agree it doesn't
 MSmits: mostly
 Remus_: how does Hawking radiation works with no volume though
 MSmits: hawking radiation happens outside the hole
 MSmits: doesn't need volume inside 
 Remus_: one half "sticks" to the surface then?
 MSmits: it's just some negative energy that takes energy away from the hole, from the outside
 MSmits: the positive part leaving the area completely
 MSmits: yeah i guess sticks is an ok way to put it
 MSmits: I always thought it's pretty bold to accept hawking radiation as truth the way they do though
 MSmits: especially since there is no theory of quantum + general relativity
 MSmits: well string theory tries to be but hawking radiation doesnt come from there
 Astrobytes: the fuzzball absorbs information as well as losing from it's surface or something like that iirc
 Kous92: Happy New Year 2022
 Astrobytes: so it doesn't actually 'lose' information in the classical sense
 DialFrost: nice u guys tlaking about thermal radiation in space on new year
 DialFrost: &lt;33
 MSmits: it just uses fuzzy logic
 MSmits: hawking radiation 
 MSmits: not thermal
 MSmits: but we can do thermal
 Astrobytes: Nah, it's not interesting enough
 DialFrost: Hawking radiation is thermal radiation that is theorized to be released outside a black hole's event horizon
 DialFrost:&#160;:/
 Remus_: start the year as you want to spend the rest, drunk and talking about physics
 MSmits: is it thermal?
 MSmits: does it follow the same curve?
 MSmits: i did not know that
 MSmits: oh yeah, says it's thermal, cool
 Astrobytes: thermal, really?
 MSmits: yeah apparently, maybe the math comes down to the same distribution of photons
 Astrobytes: This is only in classical models I assume
 Remus_: I mean, it is a black body
 MSmits: yeah ok but the mechanism is kinda different Remus_
 Astrobytes: I hate thermodynamics :D
 Astrobytes: (that's a relative hate)
 Remus_: (implied ba dum tss :joy:)
 MSmits: so, relativistic thermodynamics?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: when you say classical model, do you mean non-quantum non-relativistic or both?
 Astrobytes: Bit of both yes
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Astrobytes: Should have made that clearer since you're a physicist&#160;;)
 MSmits: I feel less of a physicist these days
 MSmits: I teach 1 class, 3 hrs a week
 Remus_: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/bh/hawk.html">https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/bh/hawk.html</a>"The Hawking luminosity L
 MSmits: and just fill in for my colleague
 MSmits: yeah so thermal
 Astrobytes: It's still there though, it doesn't go away. I'm still a biologist although not using it currently
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: i mean I am not really keeping it up
 MSmits: when I read papers it's usually because of some game I am trying to solve :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah I get that, been slacking a little recently too :D
 MSmits: biology has been in the news more though
 MSmits: so you can claim you're keeping up a bit
 Astrobytes: (I've even been slacking at that until the last month or 2 until the Omicron variant)
 Astrobytes: -1 'until'
 MSmits: that omicron variant really confused people
 MSmits: they don't know what to think anymore
 MSmits: about lockdowns, vaccines etc.
 MSmits: camps were clear before, with delta
 MSmits: now it's like, umm what's next
 Remus_: Alpha2
 Astrobytes: It evades the immune system effectively, thus decreasing efficacy of the vaccines, booster showed higher resilience against it. Severity is still the same. Mortality is unknown right now
 MSmits: severity is the same&#160;?
 MSmits: are you sure? I hear differently, a lot
 Astrobytes: Yes, in unvaxxed
 MSmits: but why so much less hospitalization than expected?
 Astrobytes: Plenty were asymptomatic or mild symptoms with all variants so far
 MSmits: sure, but with the explosion of cases, don't you expect more hospitalization?
 MSmits: it's higher than it ever was
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Yes I do, soon
 Astrobytes: But again, even only double vax still protects more
 Astrobytes: Most hospitalisations are unvaxxed currently, at least here
 MSmits: i wonder how sure they are of that
 Astrobytes: they're not, it's an evolving situation
 MSmits: i mean i would take the shots anyways, delta didn't go non-existent
 Astrobytes: Hard to manage that in terms of public affairs
 Remus_: 3rd (booster) does some good I hope, I've gotten it a few weeks ago
 MSmits: omicron could burn out and delta could just come back
 Astrobytes: Omicron is more effective at evading immunity
 MSmits: yeah but it also spreads super fast and people get natural immunity to it that way
 MSmits: then when they have it, delta could come back if they're not vaxxed
 Astrobytes: That's what omicron is good at
 Astrobytes: Evading immunity
 MSmits: the current immunity, not all immunity right? The body obviously beats it or everyone would die of it
 MSmits: so once you beat it...
 MSmits: only delta is left
 Astrobytes: It's quite a nasty little variant.
 MSmits: for contagiousness yes
 MSmits: but that also makes the waves more shortlived
 Astrobytes: No that's silly. Everyone is different. But it is extremely good at reinfection, which creates more opportunities to mutate
 MSmits: yeah thats true
 Astrobytes: It's not just about spreadability
 Astrobytes: or infectiousness rather
 MSmits: why do we never worry about the common cold mutating into something bad?
 MSmits: i mean it's always going around too
 MSmits: plenty of opportunities
 MSmits: i guess some viruses are more likely to succesfully mutate? 
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: or maybe the cold virus is already optimal for it's own survival and any mutation that makes it worse for us, makes it spread less efficiently
 Astrobytes: it's a ... um, rhinovirus I believe
 MSmits: also corona
 MSmits: there's different viruses we call cold viruses i think
 Astrobytes: yes correct
 MSmits: you never hear about them mutating into something bad. It's always coming from some animal
 Astrobytes: I think corona- and rhino- viruses are the main ones
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: I've probably had corona so many times
 MSmits: it's just a different one
 Astrobytes: but there's like hundreds of viruses that cause 'a cold'
 MSmits: it's not really clear how different 2 viruses need to be to be called separate viruses
 MSmits: there's thousands of covid versions too
 MSmits: just not many of interest
 Astrobytes: They need to be genetically different
 MSmits: but they all are
 Astrobytes: Significantly
 MSmits: yeah but thats the word
 MSmits: hard to define
 Astrobytes: as in measurably significantly different
 MSmits: sure, but there's much to measure
 Astrobytes: genes with certain consequences etc
 MSmits: it's not like physics where you have a handful of variables
 Astrobytes: well, it's a lot easier these days to sequence viral genomes
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: I wonder how long it will take before stuff like measles/polio comes back in serious amounts
 Astrobytes: I have no idea where this particular virus originated from (originally I mean) but it's one tough MF
 MSmits: this covid thing lowered vaccination rates for those as well
 Astrobytes: they were already going down thanks to internet antivaxxers
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i think there needs to be some horror-stories about paralyzed children and such before people start to take it seriously
 MSmits: it's going to happen again
 MSmits: if you read up on the history of this, it's horrifying
 Astrobytes: Death is no longer substantive evidence for vaccine abstention
 MSmits: no but thats the thing, paralyzed children aren;t dead
 Astrobytes: That's what I'm saying
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: (I could have worded it better)
 MSmits: no i get it now
 Astrobytes: (blame the whisky)
 MSmits: I've realized something the other day
 MSmits: you always hear about children being damaged by lockdowns and such
 MSmits: but my sense is, their own social media addiction hurts them more than the lockdowns ever did
 MSmits: and noone seems to take that seriously
 MSmits: 3-5 hrs a day is the average
 Astrobytes: Well yes indeed. All our priorities are backwards :D
 Astrobytes: (not 'ours' per se, but you know what I mean)
 Remus_: for one, online classes are much less effective than irl ones
 Astrobytes: Depends on age and subject
 MSmits: yes it does, but on average he's right
 MSmits: my point is not that it's not less effective
 Astrobytes: Yeah not disagreeing
 MSmits: my point is that their addiction damages them far more
 MSmits: 3-5 hrs a day is insane
 Astrobytes: absolutely
 MSmits: and thats the *average*
 Astrobytes: I was about to add I know far more under-18s who spend wayyyy longer than that
 MSmits: every spare minute they stare at their machines
 MSmits: there's no time to think
 MSmits: it turns them into machines themselves
 MSmits: if all you do is social media + work + sports + sleep, you are a machine
 Astrobytes: work 5-7 days a week 9-5 also makes you a machine, good for nothing
 MSmits: yeah but after 5 you got spare time at least
 Astrobytes: (outside of those hours)
 MSmits: with those smart-phones it's filled up with bs
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: you mean for being tired
 MSmits: sure yeah
 Astrobytes: consider most people get up at 5 or 6 to start a 8am or 9am start job (commute time)
 MSmits: that's bad too
 Astrobytes: work-life and now + tech balance is very important
 MSmits: so the social media thing just puts more pressure on this problem
 Remus_: home office ftw in that regard
 Astrobytes: yes exactly MSmits
 Astrobytes: And yes Remus_
 MSmits: my view is, there shouldnt even be balancing needed. Tech should be helpful not harmful
 Astrobytes: You utopian idealist you! :D
 MSmits: indeed&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: On that note, I'm off to drink and eat :D
 MSmits: have fun
 Astrobytes: See you later guys and have an excellent night
 MSmits: you too
 Stilgart: have fun Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: (good chat btw)
 MSmits: yup
 Remus_: good night
 Astrobytes: And you Stilgart
 Stilgart: and happy new year to everyone
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)

 quyen0w0: what up
 actualCoderTrevor: How do I move to the next league in coders strike back? It says I'm ranked 1st in wood 2 league.
 ZarthaxX: wait for your submit to end
 ZarthaxX: and you have to end above boss to promote
 ZarthaxX: and promotion takes some time
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh okay thanks!
 BlaiseEbuth: ZarthaxX the sleepless.
 eulerscheZahl: BlaiseEbuth the early bird
 ZarthaxX: 1 am here
 ZarthaxX: toaaaaad
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact sleepless
 ZarthaxX: codejam 1500?
 eulerscheZahl: 6am for me
 ZarthaxX: its saturday man :P
 ZarthaxX: oh so you missed
 ZarthaxX: it
 eulerscheZahl: codejam 1A is over, I missed it :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: but on purpose, no way i compete from 3am to 5:30am
 eulerscheZahl: so jrke really wants to publish the rubik cube solving
 eulerscheZahl: hardcoding time?
 jrke: its crashing in come tests - 'The amount of data sent to the viewer is too big!'
 ZarthaxX: yeah i thought you could not do it toad&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: i was able to do the first one and got lazy afterwards
 eulerscheZahl: what are you doing to create such huge replays jrke?
 eulerscheZahl: you make me curious
 jrke: lots of tooltips
 eulerscheZahl: i always skip codejam 1A btw
 BlaiseEbuth: codejam 1A&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: round 1A
 eulerscheZahl: i then qualify via 1B/1C or fail horribly
 eulerscheZahl: but usually round 2 is where my dreams get crushed
 jrke: i am having 54 small rectangle and 54 rounded skewed rectangle
 jrke: so maybe that causing the error
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just looking at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Jrkej/The-Cube-Enigma/blob/main/src/main/resources/view/demo.js">https://github.com/Jrkej/The-Cube-Enigma/blob/main/src/main/resources/view/demo.js</a>
 eulerscheZahl: tooltips are a huge chunk indeed
 jrke: yup 54 for each side + 1 for player and 1 for game info so total 56
 eulerscheZahl: the updates are the interesting part
 eulerscheZahl: that's 20 per rotation
 eulerscheZahl: (a bit less if some colors remain the same)
 jrke: 20 or 18?
 eulerscheZahl: I count 20
 eulerscheZahl: say you rotate the top: 8 on the top side
 jrke: oh yes my bad
 eulerscheZahl: and 3 on each edge
 jrke: 8 each face + 3*4
 eulerscheZahl: if I were you, I would probably copy the tooltip module and modify it a bit
 eulerscheZahl: so you can send compressed tooltips and unpack them for display
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl why do you skip that round? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: get rid of the repeating parts like"BLOCK:\\n---------------\\nFace"
 eulerscheZahl: because it's always as a hostile time for us Europeans
 eulerscheZahl: and then some strong players are already qualified, making it easier in future rounds :P
 eulerscheZahl: if I were Indian, I would play it though
 ZarthaxX: i thought about those 2 things lol
 ZarthaxX: this one had easy statements tho
 ZarthaxX: at least
 eulerscheZahl: this time they changed the overall schedule
 eulerscheZahl: 1B starts at 6pm which is already on the late side IMO&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: ah here is at 1pm
 ZarthaxX: the C one is 6am, but for u 11 am?
 ZarthaxX: that's a good one, on the edge tho lol
 eulerscheZahl: around lunch time
 ZarthaxX: skip that thing who cares lol
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i just have to qualify in 1B then I can skip C
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 ZarthaxX: i wished it was that easy&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: jrke a question about your scoring:
 eulerscheZahl: Else if CUBE is not solved then score = (sum for the value of all 6 faces of cube - (400 - turnIndex))
 eulerscheZahl: (for unsolved cube)
 eulerscheZahl: isn't the sum of all these values constant?
 jrke: no
 eulerscheZahl: you always have 9 red, 9 green, 9 ...
 jrke: thats for solved cube
 eulerscheZahl: so 9*1 + 9*2 + 9*3 + ...
 jrke: no you got it wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i got it the way you wrote it
 jrke: i said for each face the correct coloured side
 jrke: suppose if face is
 jrke: wrbgwgbow
 jrke: then correct are 3
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i'm picking random lines and then trying to understand while skipping the rest
 eulerscheZahl: the ceg is strong with me
 jrke: because only 3 are matching with center piece
 jrke: top left,center(always matches),bottom right
 jrke: so value is 3^2 = 9
 jrke: minimum value for a face can be 1
 jrke: cause center piece always matches and 1^2=1
 jrke: and for solved face value becomes 9^2=81
 eulerscheZahl: i got it now
 ZarthaxX: ceg showed up today toad
 eulerscheZahl: your "today" or my "today"
 eulerscheZahl: yours would mean in the last 1.5h
 ZarthaxX: it was today for you and me
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: but you were not here
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: don't know what to say to him anyways
 eulerscheZahl: "happy Caturday"?
 BlaiseEbuth: ceg?
 eulerscheZahl: prakash
 eulerscheZahl: you were hiding on #fr for too long
 BlaiseEbuth: Perhaps... So help me to be up to date.

 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 ZarthaxX: he just appeared to say he was around for the contest
 ZarthaxX: and then said he got overtaken by kids from india
 ZarthaxX: like jrke lol
 eulerscheZahl: and anid
 eulerscheZahl: the clone kid
 ZarthaxX: he said that one didnt matter because mutliple ppl used that acc lol
 Smelty: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: i always thought it was 1 user copy-pasting from multiple leaked bots
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: same, surprised me lol
 BlaiseEbuth: I was missing something.
 Smelty: :laughing:
 eulerscheZahl: does ceg know the anids in person?
 ZarthaxX: no idea
 actualCoderTrevor: woohoo I beat ZarthaxX \o/ :joy:

 ZarthaxX: i dont do clashes lol
 ZarthaxX: just going for top 1k
 ZarthaxX: and you are stopping me from getting that&#160;:(
 actualCoderTrevor: So was I you bumped we  over top 1k though! :grinning:
 ZarthaxX: :O
 ZarthaxX: noice
 ZarthaxX: stil l1500 here
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 actualCoderTrevor: *me way over
 solution.cpp: i was 1500 but 1700 now after loses
 ZarthaxX: f
 solution.cpp: gl
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh you can move down from losses? :neutral_face: I better stop lol
 ZarthaxX: yes lol
 ZarthaxX: you can decay if you dont play too anywa
 ZarthaxX: so you HAVE to 
 actualCoderTrevor: :thinking: Imma put this on my resume before that happens :laughing:
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 actualCoderTrevor: Not "top 1k of code clash" or "top 0.5%", just "I once beat ZarthaxX" 
 eulerscheZahl: definite hire
 ZarthaxX: actualCoderTrevor plz no i have family they cant know that&#160;;(
 jrke: euler any suggestion how to fix replay bug?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i wrote how already
 eulerscheZahl: since then I closed and reopened CG so chat history is gone
 jrke: same happened to me
 jrke: just reducing tooltips can work?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: they take a lot of space
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl 06:23AMif I were you, I would probably copy the tooltip module and modify it a bitso you can send compressed tooltips and unpack them for display
 jrke: thats the pro way
 eulerscheZahl: further looking into the json i also see things like this:\"toggles\":[{}]}
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure that got reduced by a PR I made a while back
 jrke: btw do you know any state of cube can be solved under 20 moves
 eulerscheZahl:  &lt;gamengine.version&gt;3.12.0&lt;/gamengine.version&gt;
 jrke: the god's number
 eulerscheZahl: that's outdated. take a newer version and you will save a few KB instantly
 jrke: which version is latest
 eulerscheZahl: "under 20", are you sure?
 eulerscheZahl: i thought &lt;= 20
 jrke: yes
 jrke: so just updating version in pom.xml can save me few KBs?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 jrke: which is latest version then?
 eulerscheZahl: but not significant, you should still do the tooltip thing
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/release-notes">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/release-notes</a>
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/gods-number/">https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/gods-number/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: your link contradicts your claims
 eulerscheZahl: it says that there are configurations that take 20 moves
 eulerscheZahl: on a side note: your puzzle seems very vulnerable to hardcoding. enough tools out there
 jrke: what to do then
 jrke: random shuffle for each test case
 jrke:&#160;?
 jrke: i mean no fixed state for each state
 eulerscheZahl: random testcases are also bad, motivate submit spamming
 eulerscheZahl: i just think that not every puzzle is adequate for an optim here on CG
 jrke: but better than getting demotivated by hardcoders
 jrke: so should i change to solo puzzle?
 jrke: with random tests
 eulerscheZahl: your puzzle, your choice
 Marchete: moin
 eulerscheZahl: ohai
 ZarthaxX: oink
 BlaiseEbuth: pyun
 Westicles: Hardcoding is fine for optims, you just need a more difficult variation on the problem
 Westicles: 64 different colors?
 Westicles: er 54...
 eulerscheZahl: at least something that wasn't studied by thousands of persons and has a dozen online solvers
 eulerscheZahl: if you disassemble a rubiks cube, you'll realize that it can be seen as having 54 different colors btw
 eulerscheZahl: you can't swap one tile of a color with another tile of the same color
 Westicles: ah
 eulerscheZahl: maybe make an impossible-to-solve cube and turn it into a real optim?
 eulerscheZahl: like 10 tiles of 1 color or just an impossible to solve rotation (not every state is reachable)
 eulerscheZahl: but jrke is already offline again, time to copy that suggestion to the contribution itself where he will find it
 eulerscheZahl: that guy always goes offline
 jrke: yeah i always go offline time-by-time 
 jacek: happy Caturday
 leastchaos:&#160;?
 realS1ant: Zartha did u share ur code?
 ZarthaxX: where?
 ZarthaxX: ah i have to click share?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 realS1ant: you're 106th over the whole thing ik u knew that lmao
 ZarthaxX: no i didnt LOL
 ZarthaxX: i dont play clash
 realS1ant: oh
 ZarthaxX: just going for an achievement
 ZarthaxX: there i shared
 realS1ant: i just wanna see didnt even finish yet lmao
 ZarthaxX: aight i did that :P
 eulerscheZahl: was it a golf clash?
 ZarthaxX: nah
 ZarthaxX: fastest
 ZarthaxX: i have been pretty gucci tho
 ZarthaxX: 5 wins in a row
 ZarthaxX: now 4 almost 6 in a row
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: anyway im done with top 1k i think
 eulerscheZahl: you only need 3 for the final achievement
 ZarthaxX: iik ik
 ZarthaxX: so im done forever
 eulerscheZahl: until they extend the quest map
 ZarthaxX: toad
 ZarthaxX: better wash your mouth
 eulerscheZahl: but for now you have to create your own contribution
 ZarthaxX: i have to do the multi
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: overkill
 eulerscheZahl: any plans what game to create?
 ZarthaxX: i wanted to do omnigon if u remember
 ZarthaxX: back in taht time when youhelped me
 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: right
 ZarthaxX: afraid of its complexity being shit anyway
 eulerscheZahl: story of my dice duel&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: that dice is freezed in teh replay
 eulerscheZahl: only shows 20s
 eulerscheZahl: default time for all cg default games
 ZarthaxX: why did it die?
 ZarthaxX: cg limit?
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i can change it but meh
 eulerscheZahl: too much effort
 ZarthaxX: it was a good trie
 ZarthaxX: i thought of omnigon 3d
 ZarthaxX: it wouldnt add anything but would look cool
 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: have you seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/614074c4f45bc5120d6d04e98ee334347d54">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/614074c4f45bc5120d6d04e98ee334347d54</a>?
 ZarthaxX: no.. :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: what do i have to look?
 ZarthaxX: 1k frames?
 eulerscheZahl: 1k player interactions
 eulerscheZahl: exceeds the 30s
 eulerscheZahl: you could use that for a time bank if you want
 codingaegosu: hmmm how to solve it???
 ZarthaxX: wow
 ZarthaxX: and how did you achieve it
 codingaegosu: I just copied other's one..
 ZarthaxX: wohoo top 1k
 codingaegosu: I can't solve it
 ZarthaxX: cya coc
 eulerscheZahl: copy-pasted the sdk and uploaded instead of importing via maven
 eulerscheZahl: then i can chage the constraint as i want
 codingaegosu: ok thank you
 ZarthaxX: okey..
 ZarthaxX: im not well versed with the sdk yet
 BlaiseEbuth: U can do the achievments now Zarthou&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: this gets beyond using the sdk
 ZarthaxX: still have that as an objective 
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth what?
 ZarthaxX: coc quest map is done
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: don't you have to wait 24h for leaderboard update?
 ZarthaxX: em, for some rank
 ZarthaxX: i mean global rank
 ZarthaxX: but coc rank updates instantly
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course, it's the most important part of the site.
 ZarthaxX: is it a joke?
 ZarthaxX: or for real
 ZarthaxX: i guess it is
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl one question before i l eave to sleep
 ZarthaxX: coz blaisa is gonna call me sleepless if i dont leave :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Sleeping is for the weaks
 ZarthaxX: do i need to mess with the js part of the sdk for anything?
 ZarthaxX: yes it is but im super weak
 ZarthaxX: :D
 eulerscheZahl: only if you get to the limits
 ZarthaxX: good then
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. have a look at tryangle catch. lots of movement, you need JS to stay within 1MB
 eulerscheZahl: or dice duel: the SDK doesn't support 3D
 ZarthaxX: okey, not the case for a board game
 jrke: yes js not neccesary for simple animations
 ZarthaxX: 3d one is insanity anyway haha
 eulerscheZahl: for everything else that works without fancy effects you don't need to touch JS
 ZarthaxX: excellent
 BlaiseEbuth: John Seeeenna&#160;!!!
 ZarthaxX: i will go back to that project later then
 eulerscheZahl: something at the scale of vindinium can be done without JS for instance
 ZarthaxX: oh great not going that far either hehe
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth why just why :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: anyway 4 20 am leaving now
 ZarthaxX: bb all
 BlaiseEbuth: :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: good night/morning
 Marchete: how do you break SDK limits?
 eulerscheZahl: let me check the download box..
 eulerscheZahl: now you can have a look
 eulerscheZahl: i pretty much copied most of the SDK into my contribution
 eulerscheZahl: then I don't have to use the official SDK anymore but can use my own fork
 eulerscheZahl: the limits are only in the SDK, not server-side
 eulerscheZahl: the server has limits too, but less strict
 eulerscheZahl: my first thought was to upload my own version to the official maven repo. but that's more effort than I was willing to take
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: actually I tried to circumvent the HTML validation where they filter the evil JS code
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't work, that part is just duplicated from the server-side cleanup
 eulerscheZahl: so in wild rage I changed the time constraint instead
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

 eulerscheZahl: he just copied some random code into the chat
 eulerscheZahl: why can't we kick in private messages?&#160;:/
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: and it's javascript :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 samueI: whats wrog with javascrtop
 eulerscheZahl: just don't use a private chat to share it. i have no use for it
 BlaiseEbuth: whats wrong with your keyboard
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even play that clash, share with someone else
 samueI: rude much
 BlaiseEbuth: "Code failed: your program was terminated before reaching the main entry point for your language" :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: try to see it from my perspective. i'm sitting here and that private chat keeps opening and annoying me
 eulerscheZahl: i don't consider my reaction as rude. more as reasonable
 Coder_prabhat: np
 jacek: the downside of popularity
 eulerscheZahl: did you forget to declare a main function BlaiseEbuth? or just some CG hiccups?
 jacek: or too big initialization stuff before the main
 BlaiseEbuth: I have a main... But the problem is on my side, just don't know what...

 BlaiseEbuth: Skisofrenya
 eulerscheZahl: last time i had it long enough for 2 christmas parties
 eulerscheZahl: and it always breaks my contributions where I use an avatar
 Coder_prabhat: please check my contribution for clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: why do you think it's more relevant than the 50 other contributions waiting for moderation?
 Coder_prabhat: i dont think so
 eulerscheZahl: ok, I'll leave a comment at your clash
 eulerscheZahl: give me a minute to write it
 BlaiseEbuth: :popcorn:
 BlaiseEbuth: long minute...
 eulerscheZahl: ok, just submitted without proofreading becuase of you

 Neumann: I always say non-sense
 eulerscheZahl: or you say reasonable things and then do nonsense?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised not to see more Japanese players (even if they can't win)
 eulerscheZahl: siman even tweetet about the event
 UnnamedCodinGamer: eulerscheZahl, when I open Dice Duel my browser gets so laggy that I can not scroll down to read the text
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's disappointing
 eulerscheZahl: do you have hardware acceleration enabled?
 struct: euler did you disable antialias?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will check
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea struct

 struct: its enabled by default I think

 UnnamedCodinGamer: also when I do use the scroll wheel on the animation the game board changes size
 struct: constructor(assets) {
 eulerscheZahl: because you zoom in/out
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: why is this allowed
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: that's desired behaviour
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ok
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I thought it is related to the lag
 UnnamedCodinGamer: animation seems heavy
 eulerscheZahl: "antialias - whether to perform antialiasing. Default is false."
 struct: oh
 eulerscheZahl: works okay-ish on my machine
 eulerscheZahl: it's from 2012, has a nvidia GTX 570
 struct: yeah, it also works fine on my machine

 eulerscheZahl: linux with chromium
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: my computer is pretty old
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hardware acceleration is off
 eulerscheZahl: dice duel is a pay-to-win game
 siman: &gt; This challenge is only available for users in one of the European countries listed in the registration form.
 struct: dice duel lags less than slcc for me
 eulerscheZahl: oh hi siman
 eulerscheZahl: congrats on reaching the finals at topcoder
 siman: thanks&#160;: )
 eulerscheZahl: i got you twice but in MM124 you were some ranks above me
 eulerscheZahl: might be interesting for you, kind of similar to hypersonic
 eulerscheZahl: starts in 2 weeks
 siman: it was lucky results for me. (MM124)
 eulerscheZahl: in the end you secured the 3rd rank with some points buffer to me, deserved finalist
 eulerscheZahl: and just 3 contests played (vdave had 6)
 siman: Yes, Stage 3 has many eligible contests, so total points to reach finalist line was too high.
 siman: congrates too :clap_tone1:
 UnnamedCodinGamer: using hardware acceleration does the job, although flickers
 UnnamedCodinGamer: *the animation flickers
 eulerscheZahl: i had some problem in that regard at Blockout
 eulerscheZahl: some surfaces completely disappearing under certain angles
 eulerscheZahl: it's still bugged&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: there are other libraries i could try, such as babylon.js
 eulerscheZahl: but not gonna port that now just to hope it might get better
 UnnamedCodinGamer: animation is not so important, if it does not hinder debugging
 eulerscheZahl: i just wanted to play with that framework/technology
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I guess my graphics card is obsolete 
 eulerscheZahl: yet pixi works fine for you
 eulerscheZahl: compromise between testing new paths and not excluding anyone
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what is pixi?
 eulerscheZahl: the 2D library that codingame uses by default
 struct: js library that cg uses on the viewer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes it does

 VizGhar: what you need exactly?
 rookie_AT: Some suggestions
 rookie_AT: I want to learn Python, so... Can you give me some advice
 killerart: yes, i can give you an advice
 killerart: don't learn python
 rookie_AT: ...
 rookie_AT: why
 Louis.: you can learn rookie_AT
 Louis.: ignore killerart
 rookie_AT: o
 rookie_AT: Thank you
 rookie_AT: I want to know what courses I should take.
 Carl_Menger: Find a book.
 Carl_Menger: Read and follow along
 Carl_Menger: I remember Automate the boring stuff being alright.
 ErrorRazor: If you wanna start right away, look for a beginner's course on the internet. Once you've got the basic syntax of the language down, you can try some easy puzzles on codingame

 Wontonimo: weird, it seems like the deadline for slcc has been extended
 Wontonimo: by a few hours ... maybe i just didn't sleep that long
 BlaiseEbuth: Time traveling with Wontonimo!
 Wontonimo: unfortunately it's only forward&#160;:(
 struct: I think I have the pruning thing almost ready
 struct: reduced from 24 moves per turn to around 10
 Wontonimo: how&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: substracting 14
 struct: I chose the angles I will need
 Wontonimo: so, something like [0, 5, 15, 45, 90, 120] and the negs
 struct: something like that
 Wontonimo: cool cool.  I'd like to hear about it _after_ the competition
 struct: I have no idea if it will work
 ZarthaxX: hey
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth great maths, impressive
 BlaiseEbuth: :sunglasses:
 Astrobytes: 24-10, that's 14, quick maths!
 Astrobytes: also, hi
 ZarthaxX: ASTROOOOOOOOOOOO
 ZarthaxX: i got to the top 1k in coc, now you can hate me
 Astrobytes: I have turned my back on you.
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: how's it going anyway
 ZarthaxX: gud
 ZarthaxX: woke up 20 mins ago
 ZarthaxX: clash till 4am was exhausting
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: and yoou?
 Astrobytes: I got up real late too for some reason. Woke up just about 3 hours ago, only went to bed at 2am
 Astrobytes: Otherwise I'm good
 BlaiseEbuth: Sleeping is for the weaks
 ZarthaxX: damn
 ZarthaxX: well i just slept 7 hs .. not much
 ZarthaxX: ikr blaise :P
 Astrobytes: I did get up at 0430 yesterday though
 Astrobytes: so I guess I did ok
 ZarthaxX: yeah you prob should sleep way more tho haha
 ZarthaxX: poor body
 Wontonimo: okay, i've got a new plan for getting higher on the leaderboard.  how about the rest of you stop trying so hard
 Astrobytes: My body is a temple and I'm not religious! :P
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Sleep and stream it, make easy money.
 Astrobytes: Hm :thinking: probably yeah
 Wontonimo: that's an excellent idea BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: Call yourself a 'Dreamfluencer'
 Wontonimo: learn to mutter ASMR -like in your sleep and you'll be rolling in the views
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: ASMR of my body movements under the cover, snoring, and my cat - should be good
 BlaiseEbuth: This kind of things seems to works better when you are an almost naked young woman.
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: no way, people are beyond that sort of thing
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Wontonimo: just ask KitKat-fbi agent when he is back
 Scarfield: asmr? also hi
 ZarthaxX: scarfoooooooooooo
 Wontonimo: Coined in 2010, ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) is a relaxing, often sedative sensation that begins on the scalp and moves down the body. Also known as "brain massage," it's triggered by placid sights and sounds such as whispers, accents, and crackles.
 Astrobytes: Annoying Sounds Make Riches
 Wontonimo: ^^ that
 Scarfield: oh, had the feeling i didnt want to google that xD
 Wontonimo: i hate it
 Wontonimo: sounds creepy to me
 BlaiseEbuth: flrflflflflf swiiiiiiii blblblblb
 Westicles: millenials paying chicks to lick microphones.  some weird fetish thing
 Astrobytes: clunk
 Scarfield: not even a -3vel bot Zarthoo&#160;:'(
 Wontonimo: lol Westicles
 Astrobytes: yeah Westicles :rofl:
 Scarfield: lol of course thats a thing
 Wontonimo: has any male YTer made money doing ASMR?  I can't imagine it
 BlaiseEbuth: I guess there less millenials than old pervert in the public...
 Wontonimo: so, anyone have any good math or theory of why 3 works so well, and not -2vel or -1.5vel.  Obviously I can see it works well, but is there serious math behind it?
 ZarthaxX: Scarfield i have been doing clash :D
 ZarthaxX: dont have time for that contest&#160;:/
 Scarfield: not when you spend your time clashing no :p
 Astrobytes: right, going to the shops so afk for a bit
 Wontonimo: wow, shops are open where you live?  must be nice
 ZarthaxX: indeed scarfo 
 Wontonimo: how does one find out about these private contests other than lurk on this channel and ask constantly?
 Westicles: Maybe I'll go see a movie today... not sure if any good ones are out
 ShannonNorris97: To answer your question about male YTers doing ASMR, Wontonimo, I'd argue that a lot of CorpseHusband's success is due to his deep voice that you might argue is ASMR
 Wontonimo: true that!
 Wontonimo: there are definitely people with great voices
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah absolutely. It must be strange for him though to be glorified for his voice, as if I remember correctly it relates to a chronic illness that he has
 jacek: somehow ASMR might be related to misophonia. some sounds are good for some but annoying for others
 Smelty: true
 ciaojian: Hey guys.I made a video that talks about techniques for Code Golf. If you are interested you can take a look
 ciaojian: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/ETcLoL9AHYc">https://youtu.be/ETcLoL9AHYc</a>
 jacek: rick roll?
 pooriaahmadi: hello world
 pooriaahmadi: this sentence has 2 meanings
 eulerscheZahl: is that Italian?
 Astrobytes: si
 ciaojian: the video is it.
 jacek: nice
 jacek: 48 chars in C? oh my
 Smelty: woa
 ciaojian: Ehhhh No. 48 characters is in ruby:sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: did he just randomly insult me at 4:15? :D
 jacek: hm?
 helenabjalkovska: there's more than one timeline my dude
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like a new SDK challenge
 eulerscheZahl: add a 2nd timeline
 Astrobytes: in 3D
 jacek: best waifus are 2D
 Astrobytes: ...
 jacek: am wrong?
 Astrobytes: I do not have, and have never had, a waifu.
 jacek: oO

 Smelty: guys- i just beat the legend league bot by using a constant speed of 100
 Smelty: the coders strike back
 Astrobytes: legend league bot? There's over 900!
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539368228">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539368228</a>
 Astrobytes: You mean the Gold boss?
 Smelty: nope legend
 jacek: thats default ai
 Astrobytes: ^
 Smelty: oOp
 Smelty: m'bad
 ZarthaxX: aka crap
 jacek: i think its weaker than silver boos
 jacek: or just some random
 Smelty: i have this weird thing in my function, its supposed to increase speed when farther but it just keeps at 100....maybe im dividing too much
 Astrobytes: It's more of a sanity checker than a real opponent
 eulerscheZahl: silver boos? do you mean "booze"?
 Smelty: what i like tho is that one of my pods were literally dysfunctional
 Smelty: also, how are some of the legend league ppl self destructing at the beginning
 Astrobytes: crashed bots
 therealbeef: buggy submits
 ZarthaxX: languages updates cause that
 Smelty: hmm okay
 jacek: Westicles is 999 in NS :thinking:
 jacek: how unlucky, if he did that few weeks ago he would be 1st
 Smelty: sad
 eulerscheZahl: Daporan was first in CSB back when the time limit was reduced from 150ms to 75ms
 eulerscheZahl: there must be several players who never updated
 Marchete: maybe he used my code to reach 999...
 Wontonimo: it would be nice if it was a game parameter that was sent in round 1
 Astrobytes: What, the winning code? :P
 Marchete: but that's good
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes - the timeout for the game
 Wontonimo: haha
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 jacek: Marchete impossibru!
 Smelty: :rofl:
 Marchete: :grin:
 Wontonimo: just realized my slcc bot has a poor heuristic.  it only works against the lead bot and doesn't even try to achieve 2nd place.  First or nothing&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i like that mentality
 Smelty: lol
 jacek: 2nd is just first loser
 jaeccrafta: how much time until junior lands a job?
 Smelty: also, 200 thrust is FAST
 eulerscheZahl: it only becomes a problem when you bot isn't strong enough for 1st
 Wontonimo: it doesn't help my placement on the leaderboard though.  when it could have gotten 2nd, it instead focuses on pushing down 1st but at the cost of becoming 3rd
 Marchete: on asymmetric NvN games
 Marchete: sometimes you should target to be 2nd
 Smelty: tru
 Wontonimo: ^^ exactly
 Marchete: hypersonic 3 players
 Marchete: for example
 eulerscheZahl: horrible game
 Smelty: also don't escape later on
 Wontonimo: haven't played that game
 Marchete: there is a position where being 2nd is like a victory
 MSmits: corner between two other players
 MSmits: leaves you little room to take boxes, high chance of being killed
 Marchete: if you do a simple voronoi you'll see
 Marchete: at some points I think I had a suicide  2nd place
 Marchete: if 1st player was too high and I was the bad player
 Marchete: btw MSmits
 Marchete: what kind on NN/ML are you learning?
 Marchete: I was trying some kind of alphzero
 MSmits: I havent started yet, mostly just been thinking
 Marchete: with terrible results :D
 MSmits: azero is very difficult to do right
 MSmits: i wouldnt do that
 Marchete: I can't pass from connect4 wood 2 league
 MSmits: try something simple. The oware thing jacek does should be easy to get working. Maybe not easy to actually win, but easy to make work
 jacek: try perfect 1-ply tic tac toe
 Marchete: what did you do on oware jacek?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/cwwq2rhX">https://pastebin.com/cwwq2rhX</a>
 MSmits: read that
 MSmits: then jacek doesnt have to explain himself again&#160;:)
 jacek: simple NN (MLP) as evaluation and used in mctsept or jacekmax
 Marchete: but at some point you doubt about jacekmax
 jacek: oh you saved that
 eulerscheZahl: "Adblocker detected! Please consider disabling it..."
 MSmits: i did
 eulerscheZahl: is that what we shall read?
 Marchete: I have "real" NN nets, ready for CG
 MSmits: what does that mean Marchete
 Marchete: at least they infer like what tensorflow says
 jacek: jacekmax and mcts-ept in my implementations differ only in backpropagation, in first you overwrite scores, in second you add and average scores.  for some games jacekmax is better, for others mcts-ept is better
 Astrobytes: I have a whole folder full of CG chat snippets&#160;:/
 Marchete: I mean it's like a tensorflow Model without using it
 jacek: is it trained?
 Marchete: sharte that folder
 MSmits: jacek both methods may have different ideal parameters, so it's hard to make a good comparison between ept and jacekmax
 MSmits: cant just take the eval of one and plug it into the other
 eulerscheZahl: that's dedication Astrobytes. i just have 2 screenshots of stupid automaton comments
 jacek: i tested with different params as well
 MSmits: ah ok, where did jacekmax do better than ept?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: I had spdns from dbd_r
 MSmits: i mean, for your oware nn it makes more sense to do jacekmax
 Marchete: then realized it doesn't keep pastebins
 eulerscheZahl: screw that bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/TbPBazO">https://imgur.com/a/TbPBazO</a>
 ZarthaxX: hahaha
 jacek: in breakthrough, yavalath, connect4 or clobber ept seems to be better
 Astrobytes: lol, 4 in a row
 ZarthaxX: is there a way to see X :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Illedan is hiding his good bot now in SLCC?
 MSmits: the other day i was explaining how nn pings you like that euler, then someone pinged nn and it pinged you
 jacek: MSmits in oware i think it is due to low branching and high depth, and if there is some refutation on high depth then averaging score would take some time to back propagate
 Astrobytes: Interesting thought jacek
 MSmits: jacek yeah, but it might depend on performance as well. With my non-NN eval, i could not get jacekmax to perform better than ept, but it gets much deeper and it may have time for this average score correction to properly happen
 Marchete: what is SLCC? I'm out of the loop
 Astrobytes: SF2442 Amadeus semi-private contest Marchete
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: don't care, just another CSB clone
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: seemed fun to me somehow
 MSmits: but no time
 Astrobytes: I am actually enjoying it, despite my initial reluctance to join
 eulerscheZahl: i refuse to get involved
 eulerscheZahl: but i pinged Illedan instead to represent C#
 MSmits: you're like a vegetarian but for csb clones
 Astrobytes: He is a vegetarian
 eulerscheZahl: and in real life
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: for csb clones and meat
 MSmits: i was thinking about this the other day
 MSmits: i havent eaten meat in a month
 ad_mo: Hello World 
 MSmits: am i a vegetarian now?
 Astrobytes: No.
 MSmits: when am i a vegetarian?
 jacek: so Marchete you have trained NN model and dont know how to use it?
 Astrobytes: When you decide not to eat it again.
 MSmits: hmm ok
 jacek: you can decide not to eat, but eat it anyway
 MSmits: so if i never eat meat again, but it is is by accident, i am not a vegetarian?
 mortadha: hi who can help me
 Marchete: no, it's training but keeps losing on naive moves
 ZarthaxX: what's up mortadha
 Marchete: I imagine my training is like 2 babies playing
 BlaiseEbuth: Sky
 ZarthaxX: ban
 Astrobytes: Vegetarian by failure to eat meat I guess :PHow'd the study/school stuff go btw MSmits?
 Marchete: you can get 60% winrate
 Marchete: but means nothing
 Smelty: hmm
 BlaiseEbuth: sky will help you if you help you first
 mortadha: i have a bad level in problem solving i need to be a good
 MSmits: Astrobytes great, got maximum grade for my FP oware game and I submitted my thesis last thursday
 mortadha: who can help me
 BlaiseEbuth: everything is  linked
 MSmits: was under horrible time pressure, hope its good enough
 Astrobytes: Nice one! I have every confidence in you.
 Marchete: it's public?
 MSmits: mmh i am not 100% confident on this one, but thanks. 
 Marchete: or under paywall?
 jacek: who would pay for any paper?
 ZarthaxX: FP?
 ZarthaxX: functional programming?
 MSmits: yes
 mortadha: please who can help i have a bad level in problem solvign
 eulerscheZahl: floating point
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 mortadha: problem solving
 BlaiseEbuth: The pressure I drink it.
 jacek: mortadha stuck on puzzle?

 Wontonimo: ^^ true
 Wontonimo: some else solve 4 u = u no learn
 ZarthaxX: oh god what is this
 Astrobytes: That is the most awful thing to read
 MSmits: FP oware game&#160;:)

 ZarthaxX: what lang is this?
 ZarthaxX: not haskell :thinking:
 MSmits: elm, very similar to haskell
 MSmits: or should be
 ZarthaxX: that's a lang? lol
 MSmits: yeah
 ZarthaxX: interesting
 MSmits: it compiles to js
 ZarthaxX: you dod the ui too?
 MSmits: easy to make web apps with
 MSmits: using a package yeah
 ZarthaxX: mmhm i feel like fp is not easy to develop an app
 MSmits: it's not
 MSmits: but it was a fp class
 MSmits: and we had to make a web app
 eulerscheZahl: work forced me to learn Blazor, pretty interesting actually
 eulerscheZahl: it's a C# web framework
 Smelty: oh?
 BlaiseEbuth: What a name
 MSmits: it's still crazy to me that a FP language does not have loops, nor variables
 ZarthaxX: ahhh okey MSmits haha
 Marchete: on oware what means "I have a rather small NN?"
 ZarthaxX: why?
 Marchete: jacek?
 ZarthaxX: recursion solves your loop stuff 
 eulerscheZahl: who needs loops when you can have recursion?
 ZarthaxX: i dont get it
 ZarthaxX: ha i won
 eulerscheZahl: so much more readable :upside_down:
 MSmits: yeah, but recursion is not exactly the most intuitive way in some cases
 ZarthaxX: *OFC*
 jacek: Marchete only 1 hidden layer
 Marchete: who needs recursion and loops when you have goto's?
 Smelty: (:
 ZarthaxX: kick this guy ^
 Marchete: so inputs -&gt; Dense -&gt; output?
 eulerscheZahl: who needs goto when you have comefrom?
 jacek: yes
 Marchete: output as softmax?
 ZarthaxX: is that true eulerscheZahl?
 jacek: no
 ZarthaxX: does it exist
 jacek: tanh. its value function only.
 jacek: i never done policy network
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM</a>
 Marchete: so the NN gives the score?
 MSmits: in jaceks case, nn gives win&#160;% basically
 MSmits: or node value -1 to 1
 MSmits: i was going to do a scoreless version with net seeds gained as value
 jacek: yeah
 MSmits: scoreless is nice because you have 12 inputs instead of 14
 Marchete: well, score == how good is that position
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: i mean seeds captured
 Marchete: without score
 Marchete: ok ok
 MSmits: i will train my bot not to stop at 24 seeds
 ZarthaxX: oh god eulerscheZahl 
 MSmits: it will just stop at endgame db
 MSmits: and maximize seed gain
 Marchete: in paper alphazero sounds good
 Marchete: but it's hard to do it
 Marchete: and to train
 MSmits: yeah, it is even hard to download and make ready made stuff work that other people wrote :P
 MSmits: so many packages&#160;:)
 jacek: have you seen alphazero in julia?
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: saw that
 MSmits: could not get it to work
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jonathan-laurent.github.io/AlphaZero.jl/dev/">https://jonathan-laurent.github.io/AlphaZero.jl/dev/</a>
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: i got that to work
 MSmits: but it was too slow :P
 jacek: it has some nice documentation
 MSmits: i run into a lot of jupyter notebook stuff
 MSmits: i was like, this looks like mathematica from the olden days
 Astrobytes: shudder
 MSmits: then i figured out that it actually is an open source version of that
 MSmits: apparently that is popular in ML circles?
 Astrobytes: It is
 jacek: and squares
 MSmits: oh and by the way jacek
 MSmits: one time
 MSmits: i paid for 1 paper!
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: pay to win on CG :scream:
 Astrobytes: He tells us now before we remind him
 jacek: :money_with_wings:
 eulerscheZahl: how much did you pay?
 MSmits: and i paid with paypal money i gained from selling a 300 line sphere grid script :P
 MSmits: on unity
 Astrobytes: 1 soul + his Unity Sphere income
 MSmits: i think it might have been 5 euros
 MSmits: maybe 10
 MSmits: and it was useless too
 Astrobytes: Was that a D&amp;B one?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: Marchete genersly my training 'pipeline' now resembles the alphazero one, except i train only value and not policy. and NN isnt convnet for simple MLP. but it works for any kind of eval
 jacek: but simple MLP*.
 eulerscheZahl: did you convert your Onitama to NN as well?
 eulerscheZahl: you got an impressive lead
 jacek: :innocent:
 jacek: yes
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 eulerscheZahl: i thought top was plateauing and pretty much playing optimally
 eulerscheZahl: you showed that there is some room left
 jacek: then recurse will come and prove there is more room left
 eulerscheZahl: haven't seen him in a while
 eulerscheZahl: might be because of my own absence
 Astrobytes: A lot of us have been around much less
 MSmits: well for me it has nothing to do with cg... i am just as addicted as ever... it's just a time issue
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's a priority issue. topcoder had some fun marathons
 eulerscheZahl: should have tried earlier

 eulerscheZahl: no bad puns?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the Ruby cube
 Astrobytes: Cuby Rube
 Astrobytes: The Lost Cube
 jrke: no i mean should i make it a puzzle or not and should i add random cases or not
 eulerscheZahl: did you read my comment?
 eulerscheZahl: i think that's a valid way to turn it into an optim
 Astrobytes: Optim would be best, euler's comment was on point
 jrke: ok i will make impossible to solve a cube by twisting one corner
 Marchete: westicles, you may be joking, but before my latest changes I was having levels with 8+ hrs for solving
 jrke: is that enough?
 Marchete: and weirdly some levels were solved by two different machines with 5 minutes diference
 eulerscheZahl: twisting 1 corner might still be too close to solvable
 Marchete: like one took 8hrs+3min and the other 8hrs+6min
 Marchete: very weird
 eulerscheZahl: i like the idea of random colors that aren't always 9 even more
 Westicles: Marchete, your code was very impressive.  I bet if you tackled samegame with a similar approach you would take first easily
 Kledi: yo please someone check the discord general chat and help me plz
 jrke: hmm looks interesting for making 10 colors for 1-2 face
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I muted that one discord channel
 Marchete: westicles my code is just a matter of frustation
 Marchete: I was having 30+hrs on some levels
 Marchete: but in the end this last code was nice, it ended really well, I'm happy others found it interesting
 Marchete: that was my idea
 WannaBeHum1n: hello, newbie question here: what should I learn to optimize my coders strike back bot 
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 Marchete: do you solve the lvl 932 stderr output, right?
 Marchete: did*
 Kledi: What language do yall use? Just wanna know what should i use for coding to be easier
 Westicles: yeah, I used your encryption thing
 Astrobytes: Kledi: you can only output one line per turn
 Astrobytes: Don't hardcode it, solve the general case.

 Astrobytes: lol too close for comfort :D
 WannaBeHum1n: as a bronzie
 Illedan: That bounce on Jeff to secure 2nd :D
 WannaBeHum1n: this is painful to look at
 Astrobytes: It was a very lucky... I mean skillful bounce :P
 Illedan: Yeah, 100&#160;% luck. I'm not even searching that far :joy:
 Astrobytes: depth?
 Illedan: Secretz
 jrke: lol
 eulerscheZahl: I think your block before at checkout 4 wasn't ideal. You lost the 2nd place there
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: That is another story
 Illedan: lets not talk about that
 jrke: i am currently writting my using 20 hardcoded angles
 Astrobytes: It's a fine line between deciding to block someone or just keep going
 jrke: i don't know if i am right
 eulerscheZahl: but i like putting my finger in the wound
 Illedan: And twist it
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Illedan: With acid
 Astrobytes: And plenty of salt.
 eulerscheZahl: no, just a bit of :salt:
 Illedan: Lemon.
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm getting old
 WannaBeHum1n: do these bots use some kind of reinforcement learning or is it all algorithms by the developers
 Astrobytes: Depends on the game
 XeroOl: it's hard to do reinforcement learning without a data set
 WannaBeHum1n: the replay
 WannaBeHum1n: of the coders strike back
 jrke: only top 4 you can look at leaderboard uses ML out of 100k+ players
 WannaBeHum1n: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: but the replay isn't from coders strike back
 WannaBeHum1n: oh
 WannaBeHum1n: it looks very similar
 Astrobytes: it's from SLCC SF2442 (I just love typing that)
 WannaBeHum1n: can I select the bot of specific person to test against in ide&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Astrobytes: If they are in the same league or below you
 Astrobytes: For I think 1000 places
 eulerscheZahl: that limit is such a 1% thing
 jrke: yup only top 1000 
 WannaBeHum1n: how to do it&#160;? I beat the boss in the ide the I got like 200 in the bronze league then changed my code just to end up in 16k xDDD
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 emerzon: problems too easy
 Astrobytes: WannaBeHum1n1: You don't always need a 100% winrate against the boss, you have to beat everyone else really well and get more points than it has
 Illedan: But don't promote 100k players now plz
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: the limit would still be 1000
 eulerscheZahl: to fight against
 eulerscheZahl: in IDE
 eulerscheZahl: because that's easier than adding pagination :imp:
 Astrobytes: ":salt:"
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx everyone
 jrke: there is only game for me which looks tough to me
 jrke: that is ocean of code
 jrke: tried hard but still in wood 1
 eulerscheZahl: but OoC is so deep
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jrke: problem is i have better movement but no torpedo
 Illedan: ^^
 jrke: what do you think which type of multiplayer game will be spring challenge 2021?
 Astrobytes: Bot programming. In a fun, non-competitive way of course.
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: servers will fry 4sure
 Astrobytes: Even if I don't like the CG one at least I had some fun with SLCC
 eulerscheZahl: I stick with my prediction68c9c0f65e242d686fe26fffc1a830ad7451a2ae4238a9d3f30e0d913e4b2b6c

 ZarthaxX: what is that
 ZarthaxX: oh god its leaking!
 Smelty: o.O
 eulerscheZahl: sha256sum of my prediction
 ZarthaxX: thought so
 eulerscheZahl: so i can tell you what I predict afterwards
 ZarthaxX: you can send a private message :D
 Smelty: hmm
 ZarthaxX: i will dedicate these days in reversing sha256sum
 ZarthaxX: whatever
 Astrobytes: yeah, like we're gonna try that :P
 ZarthaxX: dude this characters doesnt stop
 ZarthaxX: oh :O
 eulerscheZahl: and astro provoked that long line :P
 eulerscheZahl: that's a trick I learnt from Automaton NN
 ZarthaxX: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤

 eulerscheZahl: it goes upwards AND downwards
 jrke: chat line
 ZarthaxX: nope

 Marchete: as if this chat was fragile enough, you all start breaking it
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 Marchete: wasn't*
 Astrobytes: I prefer the indented version, at least I can read the damn chat
 Illedan: Submit slower now?
 Astrobytes: yeah, a little bit. It's been variable
 XeroOl: is there a way to view all the puzzles I've solved already?
 Astrobytes: Go into /training/&lt;difficulty_level&gt; and scroll down
 Astrobytes: *activities/practice/&lt;difficulty_level&gt;
 XeroOl: ahh I see
 XeroOl: thanks!
 Astrobytes: np
 eulerscheZahl: and then remove he difficulty level from the URL, it's completely irrelevant
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 darkhorse64: i have not done the maths but 200 turns x 3 x 100 ms is already 1 mn for one game. So submits cannot really be fast. Or did I miss something&#160;?
 Smelty: :0
 Astrobytes: Not all bots use the whole 100ms darkhorse6
 Astrobytes: 4
 eulerscheZahl: you don't tab that nickname?
 eulerscheZahl: i sometimes want to tab words that are not actual names. then either nothing happens or i get a nick that I don't want and have to delete it again
 darkhorse64: Yeah but top bots play top bots which are searching
 eulerscheZahl: IDE autocompletion has a strong influence on me
 Astrobytes: Usually quicker when I know the name to type it
 Astrobytes: Yeah darkhorse64, but servers can still be slow
 eulerscheZahl: you can type 8 remaining letters faster than hitting tab?
 eulerscheZahl: was about to ask if you spell me out. but you just call me "euler"
 darkhorse64: I suspect lots of CG benchmarks occurring
 Astrobytes: Indeed 
 eulerscheZahl: from hiders?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still waiting for the :popcorn: moment
 darkhorse64: not necessarily 
 Astrobytes: Not only, most of top will be benching
 Astrobytes: What :popcorn: moment? It's a foregone conclusion for 1st surely

 Astrobytes: Also eulerscheZahl: I try not to ping you much in case the automaton picks up on it :P
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that it gets retrained so meh
 eulerscheZahl: and only matters if you start the sentence with me
 Astrobytes: And by 'quicker to type it' I mean rather than get 15 different weird usernames everytime I tab
 eulerscheZahl: true, the disadvantage of mod status
 Astrobytes: Yep
 XeroOl: I'm trying to code golf something, but the puzzle isn't technically marked as code golf
 XeroOl: is there a way to show the char count?
 jacek: open some code golf puzzle and paste code there
 Astrobytes: Keep a code golf puzzle open and paste it in there
 XeroOl: ahh, good idea
 Astrobytes: 1-0 to you jacek
 Ghostyy: hi, yk the powe of thor problem?
 Ghostyy: power
 jacek: hm?
 WannaBeHum1n: why is there a counter 
 WannaBeHum1n: for promotion
 WannaBeHum1n: to silver
 ZarthaxX: you have to wait some time for promotion
 WannaBeHum1n: but i am going to promote&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: yep
 Astrobytes: Feel the excitement
 WannaBeHum1n: hahahahaha
 Astrobytes: Savour the anticipation
 ZarthaxX: *OH MAI GAD IM DOIN IT DAD*
 WannaBeHum1n: can i close chrome&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: *JUST 20 HOURS LEFT*
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: it's not in your pc
 Astrobytes: Yeah you can
 WannaBeHum1n: SILVER BABY XD
 WannaBeHum1n: only 10 mins
 Astrobytes: congrats

 WannaBeHum1n: in ide
 WannaBeHum1n: coders strike back
 ZarthaxX: put him as opponent?
 Astrobytes: we told you earlier&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Has to be in the same league, or within 1000 places below you
 Astrobytes: Replace DEfaultAI/Boss with that player
 LDami: Hello&#160;! Is our script saved if we change the page without submit it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: If you press play it will be saved
 Astrobytes: No submission required
 LDami: and we can submit multiple time?
 xGuGu: yes
 Astrobytes: Yep
 LDami: Ok, thanks :D

 LDami: I can't pass the last test of mars landing 2, too difficult&#160;:')
 LDami: Oh thanks&#160;! I already came here few years ago but I've forgotten the basics
 Astrobytes: Check the forum thread, there might be something to help you in there
 Astrobytes: Assuming you did Mars Lander Part 1
 LDami: Yep I did
 Astrobytes: Nice to have you back again then&#160;:)
 LDami: Oh, Mars lander 3 was released. bruh, not for me
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: It's also an optimisation game
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/mars-lander">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/mars-lander</a>
 LDami: Nice, I should probably pass the level 2 before
 ZarthaxX: that thing is a nightmare
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Write a GA for the optim and let it do the work for 2 and 3 :D
 LDami: What is a GA&#160;? (I'm french so there is few words/acronym I don't understand :3)
 Astrobytes: AG
 LDami: It's not better&#160;:')
 ZarthaxX: Anonymous Glue
 ZarthaxX: Genetic algorithm LDami
 Astrobytes: Algorithme génétique&#160;;)
 LDami: Oh
 ZarthaxX: ULALA THE FRENCH DUDE
 ZarthaxX: stop pretending you britiash
 LDami: :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: putain de merde
 LDami: oh eh
 Astrobytes: mdr
 LDami: I don't pretend to be british :p I'm just training myself to speak a different language
 Astrobytes: LDami: he was talking to me :D
 LDami: (and french community is less active)
 LDami: :neutral_face:
 AntiSquid: astro is prolly from normandy
 LDami: I'm from Normandie too
 Astrobytes: No, Grangemouth, Scotland.
 Astrobytes: Nowhere near as nice as Normandie
 LDami: Dude, you trolled me xD
 AntiSquid: sure, cheese eater @astro
 Astrobytes: French cheese is amazing!
 LDami: I'm not a fan
 LDami: not a cheese lover
 Astrobytes: Morbier, raclette, camembert, brie, reblochon.... come on!
 AntiSquid: theres got to be 1 type you like lol LDami
 LDami: cancoillotte  &lt;3
 LDami: and raclette sure
 Astrobytes: Oh cool, I forgot about that stuff. Never had it. Does it taste like Comté?
 LDami: Not really, cancoillote is smooth
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the texture sure. The taste though
 Astrobytes: Or you mean it's very mild?
 LDami: Both, yeah it's mild
 LDami: as raclette
 Astrobytes: You don't like strong cheeses then&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Raclette is life
 LDami: Is it famous in scotland&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No. I lived in London and had a few French girlfriends (and friends)
 Astrobytes: Life changing experience :D
 LDami: ahah I imagine
 LDami: In fact, not really because I never leaved France :p
 Astrobytes: Much harder to go between UK and France now unfortunately&#160;:(
 LDami: yep&#160;:/

 therealbeef: they dont like hotlinking in Grangemouth
 Astrobytes: meh, google it. We have a massive Ineos refinery and numerous other chemical plants
 Astrobytes: It's a major link in the Forties oil pipeline.
 Astrobytes: Born here and unfortunately moved back here.
 therealbeef: no place like home
 Astrobytes: Pff.
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes called me piece of sh*t?
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX mon petit chou, don't worry, was just some light French banter :D
 Smelty: o . o
 LDami: c'est tout mimi
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: un peu trop mimi, non?
 LDami: c'est jamais trop mim's
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes alright alright, everything is OK :relaxed:
 Astrobytes: :french_bread:
 AntiSquid: was a random joke Astrobytes with a reference to some history scotland and normandy and england actually had in common 
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: The French and Scots are known as the Auld Alliance here
 Astrobytes: (Vieille Alliance) 13th century I think
 AntiSquid: rating my own puzzle 5 stars :thinking:
 Smelty: lolol
 Astrobytes: You made a puzzle?
 AntiSquid: 3 days of 12 hours shifts (software support) and now writing a complaint about the bullshit accusations my previous landlord wrote, nothing legit ... automaton2000 where's the solution?
 Automaton2000: might be a bit confusing
 Astrobytes: I was gonna ask about that AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes was something i thought of making because people keep asking how to prepare for CG SQL interview questions
 AntiSquid: that would be a first puzzle
 AntiSquid: will consider when how i get time to do more and what kind of
 Astrobytes: There's a SQL puzzle already I think, but sure, would be useful I reckon
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes there's basically some pictures they took before the cleaner i paid for cleaned up, then there's some bills for rennovating shit that was long overdue
 AntiSquid: what is the other sql puzzle? not aware
 AntiSquid: couldn't find
 Astrobytes: Oh it's yours :D
 AntiSquid: then there's bills for redecoriting stairwells (was living ground floor and stairwells were only accessible to the flats above
 AntiSquid: @Astrobytes "... and he is name was ... it was you..." *thunder sounds* song ends
 leojean890: tryangle-catch is kinda hard :P
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: They are straight up taking the piss, if you don't go to Citizen's Advice or get a lawyer on it you can't do a damn thing
 leojean890: hello&#160;;)
 leojean890: tryharding pseudo-CSB  contest&#160;?^^
 Astrobytes: hey leojean890
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/gOMhN-hfMtY?t=475">https://youtu.be/gOMhN-hfMtY?t=475</a>
 Astrobytes: Just trying to stay top 20 tbh
 leojean890: same I haven't pushed for 5 days :p 
 AntiSquid: astro currently just disputing deposit through the deposit holder
 AntiSquid: tons of 12 hour shifts atm
 Astrobytes: Also been fixing bugs so it's gonna be useful for CSB/SR/BR
 leojean890: But in the meantime I did an AI for chess, night of war and try angle xD
 AntiSquid: ya will try the citizen's advice bureau too for sure
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: I highly recommend CAB
 leojean890: 11/41 chess, 3/16 night of war..
 leojean890: tryangle harder :P
 Astrobytes: Tryangle requires a lot of time investment
 AntiSquid: but they want to also charge extra not just the deposit, about 2k more, it's really disgusting Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Chess too if serious
 leojean890: (and chess is have to reach #1 I think :P)
 leojean890: hard*
 Astrobytes: Night of War... I just don't really know what to make of that game
 leojean890: NOW.. I just have eval depth 1^^
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: It's bollocks mate, fight it all the way
 leojean890: with around 10 criterions hmm^^
 AntiSquid: ya my intent
 leojean890: Tryangle requires a lot of time investment =&gt; yeah I think so:) 
 Astrobytes: leojean890: I haven't figured out a decent eval yet
 Astrobytes: for NOW
 Astrobytes: hah, literally for now
 leojean890: I see^^
 Astrobytes: wtf, papyjo knocked me right down
 leojean890: papyjo participates as well in many commu multis
 Astrobytes: Yes I know, I usually take pride in beating him&#160;:)
 leojean890: (like me, did almost something for everything)
 leojean890: except.. checkers, yinsh, CALM, LOCAM
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, I try to do most multis (especially community) and I know the regulars!
 Astrobytes: I still have a few to catch up on
 leojean890: and langton
 leojean890: 5 missing
 leojean890: but MANY need to be improved more xD
 Astrobytes: Same
 Astrobytes: My Langton is broken I think
 Smelty: acti0n <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539468696">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539468696</a>
 leojean890: langton is one of the 5 I didn't begin :p
 leojean890: Astrobytes so you do something for most as well:)
 Astrobytes: It was broken for a while I remember
 Astrobytes: Yes of course leojean890
 leojean890: yinsh seems to be hard as well
 Astrobytes: I still have a load of official CG ones I still need to do properly, I always get caught up in community games&#160;:)
 leojean890: papyjo knocked you right down&#160;? what multi&#160;?^^
 Astrobytes: Night of War
 leojean890: same, I did a bad job for some CG officials :P
 Astrobytes: I've resubmitted
 leojean890: sometimes a bad winrate spams submit and it hurts^^
 Astrobytes: Yeah it was exactly that
 leojean890: especially PCR CR CR BOTG where I'm still bronze :P
 Astrobytes: Do you use a voronoi type heuristic in NOW? Seems useful
 leojean890: hmm CR (crystal rush) is not good but silver ^^
 leojean890: no, I use voronoi in COK tron and codingame sponsored challenge
 leojean890: not other games
 leojean890: NOW maybe it could be, yes
 Astrobytes: Seems like reachable cells could be useful in NOW no?
 leojean890: yes maybe in order for your army to be safer
 Astrobytes: Any heuristics you'd like to share? :P
 Astrobytes: I admit I haven't really coded anything special yet, got caught up in the SLCC
 leojean890: not move to be killable, kill if possible, favor if you move in order for him to be killable when you are not
 leojean890: so he HAS tof lee^^
 leojean890: to flee
 leojean890: try to face the direction with most spots
 Astrobytes: Yes, the direction one is good
 leojean890: if you are at x==2 it's better to face right
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'll get back to it next week I guess
 leojean890: SLCC I worked on that a few days on the beginning and didn't go on a lot but still think about it a little in case I would have ideas
 Astrobytes: What do you use? I just adapted my crappy CSB GA a bit
 leojean890: I have heuristics to increase my level or decrease his
 leojean890: same I started from magus PM to do SR
 leojean890: I tuned a simulated annealing on SR
 ElectronDon: yuuuh
 leojean890: with patience, temperature coeff..
 leojean890: and used that on SLCC
 leojean890: with another eval
 ZarthaxX: SR?
 Astrobytes: Search Race
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: hard one lol
 leojean890: I played on probas to have more chances to modify high depths than little depths in my game state
 Astrobytes: Nice. I think I will be spending some time on these games the next few weeks (CSB/SR/BR)
 leojean890: because little depths have ALREADY be tuned during previous turns
 Astrobytes: Yeah, increased mutation rate later makes more sense of course
 leojean890: BR.. I should do something cool on it someday:p
 leojean890: I just have a -3vel XD
 leojean890: in order to get prisoners and throw them fast:P
 leojean890: -vel here
 Astrobytes: it's not the easiest of multis I tell you :D
 Illedan: Top league in BR takes some time
 leojean890: but could do a real sim
 Astrobytes: I've never done a smitsi properly yet
 leojean890: I believe both of you^^
 leojean890: BR is hard, it's net:)
 leojean890: and top bots are nicely optimized 
 Astrobytes: there, back to my spot in NOW
 Astrobytes: re Curse did NN for that
 leojean890: hehe^^so you have bad WR against papyjo on it :p
 Astrobytes: Everyone else is Smitsimax I think
 YurkovAS: PCR good multi for learn smitsi
 leojean890: I see, I think preparing this kind of NN is hard work and good knowledge is needed
 Astrobytes: No, for NOW, there was a whole bunch of submits that beat me and dragged me down
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS yeah?
 YurkovAS: Astrobytes yes
 Astrobytes: I thought it would be too complex
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 AntiSquid: at least i've done the quest map? lol
 AntiSquid: what a great day
 Astrobytes: Chin up squiddy
 AntiSquid: i remember someone at CG said something about next level quest map, but i doubt most people complete the initial one
 AntiSquid: ya nothing else there to do in the jungle Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: you too chin up :D
 leojean890: Astrobytes from several people in NOW recently&#160;?
 leojean890: too complex to work a smitsimax&#160;?
 Astrobytes: leojean890: nah just papyjos previous submits had dragged me down
 YurkovAS: Astrobytes i'm use this example for sim<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/RefereeCollection/blob/master/PokerChipRace/PokerChipRaceRefereeIncomplete.cs">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/RefereeCollection/blob/master/PokerChipRace/PokerChipRaceRefereeIncomplete.cs</a>
 leojean890: I see, he often spams submits on many community games hehe:
 leojean890: (me sometimes too&#160;!!^^)
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: I think they might have been referring to the Escape Room things, not sure
 Astrobytes: leojean890: we all do :P
 AntiSquid: "god path" was one of the things they said, so no, they wanted a ultra hardcore quest map :D
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS: thank you, I'll take a look
 leojean890: I still didn't try the CG escape^^
 leojean890: should try that someday:)
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Hmm, perhaps it needs to be mentioned again
 AntiSquid: it's worth trying, unique, something new, fun at least once imo LeonardoBorges
 AntiSquid: leojean890
 Astrobytes: hahaha same autocomplete fail I just had
 leojean890: oh they will create another path on the quest map&#160;? "god path" for people who won the other&#160;?

 leojean890: unique, something new, fun at least once =&gt; I believe you, it seems to be special&#160;:)
 leojean890: I tried one virtual escape game someday
 leojean890: (not with code)
 leojean890: with a teams session with other people
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: nice, good catch
 leojean890: and some observing and clicking and solving puzzles&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: leojean890: There are different challenges, so you have some variety, which increases the 'fun'
 Astrobytes: Not a lot of coding required tbh
 leojean890: I see, I like variety
 IJustKilledYouV2: **this is not a promo**Guys, if u know basics from some programming language and u find codingame difficult, try hackerrank
 leojean890: so a little coding and also solving puzzles without code
 leojean890: hackerrank is something else, no&#160;? some hacking challenges
 leojean890: and CG =&gt; algo challenges
 Astrobytes: You still have to provide the asnwers using code, but you can solve without actually coding an algo for some (most)
 leojean890: so, hardcoding, like number shifting :P
 LDami: hey guys, in "don't panic - level 2", my nbElevators is equal to 0 for the first test, but there is a elevator .. Am I wrong&#160;?
 Astrobytes: leojean890: Not always no, sometimes you need to have a sort or something, basic decryption algo etc
 leojean890: I see
 leojean890: guess encrypted codes
 leojean890: or sort data
 leojean890: already saw this kind of concepts in escapes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, nothing crazy. Just decrypting something via a clue or whatever, sorting based on a clue etc
 Astrobytes: Oh it's very true to the whole escape thing
 leojean890: yes, like the other virtual escape I did&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I think perhaps there should be levels of difficulty, where more coding is required at higher levels
 Astrobytes: To make it more interesting
 Astrobytes: Otherwise it'll just be the same as any other online escape room challenges
 Astrobytes: More or less
 leojean890: more coding or thinking level is required, I suppose
 AntiSquid: include bot programming at higher levels lol
 Astrobytes: lol
 leojean890: high thinking level is nice too
 AntiSquid: there's a pod that needs to maneauver through a maze to unlock a key to a cupboard of ingredients a different bot uses to plate up something that turns into giant billiard balls that run all over the board
 AntiSquid: (escape)
 Astrobytes: *plate up something according to an unspecified menu :P
 AntiSquid: i am sleepy, my references aren't very clear, but basically just mash up CSB code a la mode PCR in the example or any random stupid mix
 Astrobytes: Oh no I got it :D
 leojean890: coding bot behaivior is escape may be fun too^^
 Marchete: please
 AntiSquid: kutulu with mining crystals and laying mines
 Marchete: let PCR on a freezer
 Marchete: never ever use it for anything
 Marchete: worst sim ever
 Astrobytes: lol really? I always hear conflicting reports
 AntiSquid: number shifting + a*craft + xmas rush
 Astrobytes: Because of the collision caching Marchete?
 Marchete: because everything
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: you need to move numbers, but there are arrows and you can add more arrows and you can move row / columns like in xmas rush ... escape game
 samueI: what
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or just do space race
 Marchete: if you have two chips joining on a corner == mayhem
 AntiSquid: ikr&#160;? pretty cool samueI
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all by itself
 Marchete: too many little things
 AntiSquid: paper soccer + tryangle catch :o
 Marchete: there are so many chips that the result of a turn can be completely different if a little thing changes between your sim and the referee
 AntiSquid: + yinsh maybe too since it has triangles
 Astrobytes: Can't you kinda generalise that out via something like Smitsi though Marchete? As in, you don't need to be tooo concerned with those particular details
 AntiSquid: well Marchete since the joke was to make it a really confusing and hard escape, you just give arguments to use PCR
 Marchete: PCR is just pain
 Marchete: not hard
 AntiSquid: good
 Marchete: on the other hand, smitsi needs an accurate sim like any other search algo
 AntiSquid: fitting 
 Marchete: and it's not easy to have an accurate and fast simn
 Wontonimo: no?
 Marchete: so PCR needs to be archived or something
 Astrobytes: I'm intrigued as to the details on PCR Smitsi. Yurkov still is 1st?
 Marchete: no, like 3 balls being absorbed at the same time, and they are moving too
 Marchete: near a wall
 Marchete: yes, he is 1st
 Wontonimo: it's kinda hard to argue with results
 AntiSquid: hm seeing all the new talks and research about ML that is focused around learning to play a game from watching fewer games make me think the sim approach got to be superfluous 
 Astrobytes: Only just. Do you also Smitsi Marchete?
 Marchete: I haven't tested more, but his bot seemed more powerful than mine
 Marchete: so there is no point on resubmit or anything
 Marchete: I do Smitsi too, yes
 Astrobytes: So if you think PCR is not good to learn Smitsi properly what would you recommend?
 AntiSquid: CSB
 AntiSquid: join the church
 Marchete: PCR is good for smitsi
 Marchete: it's just PCR is awful
 Astrobytes: Cool. I can take some pain.
 Marchete: I've used it on xmas rush too
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's a weird one but I like the approach.
 Marchete: If you are ready to take pain, go for PCR
 Marchete: just double and triple check the referee
 Astrobytes: Noted.
 Marchete: and do some simple playruns on CG servers
 Astrobytes: Also noted.
 Marchete: like playing dumb bots + sim
 Marchete: and check how many turns do you drift
 Marchete: I had errors on multicollisions on hard places
 Astrobytes: Right, given the game that does make sense
 Marchete: this game is very sensitive to order of things
 Marchete: like what chip eats others
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the collision order is important
 Astrobytes: Can it not be pruned somewhat by just taking the first 2 or 3 collisions into account? Or 1-2 depending on the situation?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Since we get 2 minutes for a nuclear launch decision, can we get more than 40ms on CG?
 Astrobytes: No PatrickMcGinnisII, tha fun is in the time constraint
 Astrobytes: *the not tha, I'm not no Juggalo
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I gotta eat
 Astrobytes: gn all
 Illedan: gn
 Illedan: Stop talking about PCR. That is an obsession I will not try for another 15 hours or so
 Astrobytes: lol
 Marchete: I completely agree
 Illedan: I wanna try my new SLCC algo in PCR :D
 Marchete: what algo?
 Marchete: GA?
 Marchete: :D
 Illedan: GA variant
 Astrobytes: Still GA?
 Astrobytes: You have to do a PM you know
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: Now I need to be silent
 Astrobytes: Informal PM for us
 Abe1998: Has anyone done the ASCII art game?
 Marchete: GA is terrible for adversarial games
 Abe1998: Im new and im struggling
 Marchete: unless you add them
 Smelty: Abe1998 not yet
 Marchete: to your genome
 Marchete: how's the ranking btw?
 Marchete: in SLCC
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge</a>
 Astrobytes: Depends how you do it Marchete. Certain GA types are suited to adversarial situations, some more for parameter optimisation, some more so for just function approximation - it's how you do it that counts
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I am actually leaving now
 Marchete: I only talk about the classic GA we used here on CG
 Marchete: gn
 Astrobytes: Good night&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: RHEA
 ZarthaxX: gn puto
 ZarthaxX: RHEA thinks reminds me of :poop:
 ZarthaxX: godammit
 ZarthaxX: thing*
 Smelty: hMmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.asciitable.com/">http://www.asciitable.com/</a>
 Smelty: oops wrong link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/Xw0GJz.jpg">https://snipboard.io/Xw0GJz.jpg</a>
 ZarthaxX: the f lol
 ZarthaxX: print nothing Smelty
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Smelty: xD
 struct: hi
 Smelty: hi
 Peele: does someone have a problem in the clash when the code is correct and you pass all the tests and you still don't get 100%?
 Smelty: this can happen, especially with hardcoded solutions
 Smelty: the validators and the tests are different to prevent hardcoding
 struct: bad validators
 Smelty: that too
 samueI: why did i get 0%
 samueI: i had the right code but got zero percocet
 Smelty: which puzzle
 Peele: I was thinking now the test was simple all I got long long A input value and had to do pow(A,A)*A but I just printed that without storing it first in the long long variable and probably validator had some really big numbers
 Smelty: hmm, probably
 struct: had almost no time for slcc today&#160;:(
 struct: 21 hours left and I need to go to sleep
 ZarthaxX: only 21? wow
 ZarthaxX: i was planning to start tomorrow (?
 ZarthaxX: hi structo&#160;:*
 struct: lol
 -[._.]-: um whats slcc
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/sofia-labs-coding-challenge/">https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/sofia-labs-coding-challenge/</a>
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: silicon laser coffe cup
 ZarthaxX: struct&#160;;(
 struct: Good thing I ditched the avx sim
 ZarthaxX: ruined MY JOKE
 struct: sorry ZarthaxX&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: you threw away optim?
 ZarthaxX: impressive of you
 struct: Well I would have no time to complete it
 struct: I have the sim from csb
 struct: But I never added smitsi to it
 struct: at least the avx version
 ZarthaxX: pity
 struct: I think it wont have much benefits
 ZarthaxX: well i hope u end at the top
 struct: unlikely
 struct: I havent even benched my bot
 ZarthaxX: algorithm is always better than optims&#160;:)
 struct: Sure ZarthaxX but if you can have both
 ZarthaxX: well then find a bench and put your bot on it
 struct: My problem on using avx with smitsi or similar 
 struct: is that backprop is also expensive
 ZarthaxX: i doubt you will get much more from a bit more sims tbh
 ZarthaxX: i remember that the GA found best solution for example before the limit
 ZarthaxX: so less sims would make no difference
 struct: The difference between searching from depth 4 and depth 5 on some games can be huge
 ZarthaxX: ah backprop many thingies
 ZarthaxX: yes but that's on an exhaustive search
 ZarthaxX: not this type of search
 struct: But how do you GA 2 pods at the same time
 struct: I have no idea how
 struct: I know I can sim one the sim other and the same again
 ZarthaxX: well i say mentioned GA, not saying u should use that
 ZarthaxX: the old times involved simming one with GA and using a dummy for the other
 ZarthaxX: then using the GA results as a dummy and GA yours
 ZarthaxX: etc
 ZarthaxX: here would be i guess like 2 dummies
 ZarthaxX: it's annoying to have 3
 struct: Maybe Ill add GA to my list
 struct: on to learn
 ZarthaxX: sure thing
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 struct: I need to ask icebox
 struct: So he can teach me in 2 minutes
 ZarthaxX: what?
 struct: He was the one with teached me beam search
 struct: it took like &lt; 5 minutes
 ZarthaxX: ah lmao
 ZarthaxX: honestly resources out there ar eexcellent
 struct: icebox &gt; resources
 ZarthaxX: nah :P
 AntiSquid: icebox best teacher?
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/">https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/</a>
 struct: yes AntiSquid
 struct: IceBox is a very good teacher
 struct: ZarthaxX
 struct: I look at that and I see a wall of text
 AntiSquid: icebox as minister of education
 ZarthaxX: well
 ZarthaxX: it's pretty cool text
 ZarthaxX: you cant rely on people always 
 struct: I think I saw that before
 struct: Doesnt that guy used some weird language?
 Wontonimo: Dan Shiffman does some fun stuff on the coding train
 Wontonimo: including evolution stuff
 Wontonimo: makes it seem so approachable
 ZarthaxX: oh god it's the train guy, i never knew that
 ZarthaxX: D:
 Wontonimo: yeah, he uses javascript
 ZarthaxX: struct js is weird?
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: He uses processing
 ZarthaxX: well, graphics
 Wontonimo: yup
 ZarthaxX: who cares
 ZarthaxX: that explanation is cool
 struct: I know
 struct: Im not complaining
 ZarthaxX: anyway the reality is that you are wasting time on chat instead of winning slcc
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: I never will win a contest
 struct: and its fine
 Wontonimo:&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: i will never*
 ZarthaxX: same here
 struct: my best contest was fc2020
 ZarthaxX: wanna jump from a cliff together?
 struct:&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: oh last one?
 ZarthaxX: so you are progressing
 ZarthaxX: next one will be top 50
 ZarthaxX: then top 20
 struct: well I spent 2 nights without sleeping
 ZarthaxX: aaaaaand then you will degrade and end like me
 struct: I spent like 30 hours awake
 ZarthaxX: :D contests tend to do that
 struct: Its not worth
 struct: My brain was dead
 ZarthaxX: nope
 ZarthaxX: gotta be healthy
 struct: I hope next contest is good
 struct: I think this week there will be a new escape
 struct: Do you want to give it a try ZarthaxX?
 Wontonimo: what, you haven't make #1 in a contest like everyone else?  I mean, like dozens of people make #1 in every contest
 struct: Still wontonimo
 struct: gap from 100 to 1 is still huge
 struct: I will even say that gap from 1000 to 100 is closer
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo is that sarcasm?
 ZarthaxX: struct i want to but idk if i will have anytime at all
 ZarthaxX: any time*
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: yes, total sracasm.  sorry.  I beat myself up for not getting to #1
 ZarthaxX: thought so :rofl:
 Wontonimo: and i just have to remind myself ... there is only 1 #1 and a LOT of people are trying super hard to get there
 struct: re curse day 1 bot can beat me 14 days bot
 struct: beat my*
 Wontonimo: sorry it my attempt to reverse cheer you up failed horribly
 struct: its fine
 struct: I dont feel sad about it
 ZarthaxX: lol struct that's a classic for me in contests
 struct: I should just write some templates for cg
 struct: or w/e its called
 ZarthaxX: i have thought about that, but idk how itwould be useful :sweat:
 struct: Well you would only need to code the sim
 ZarthaxX: if you are able to make such a  template, i feel like they are always different haha
 Smelty: my distance to next checkpoint calculator is acting weird, half the time it says NaN
 struct: paste the function here
 struct: maybe you are dividing by 0?
 Smelty: distance = (((myX-checkX[Id])^2+(myY-checkY[Id])^2))^2;
 Smelty: i added the square/sqrt at the end because it was returning negatives
 Smelty: the checkX and checkY are the checkpoints, and myX/myY are my cords
 struct: why 3 ^2?
 struct: inline float distance2(Vec2 v) const { return (x - v.x) * (x - v.x) + (y - v.y) * (y - v.y); }
 struct: inline float distance(const Vec2 v) { return sqrtf(distance2(v)); }
 Smelty: hmm
 Smelty: okay
 Smelty: now its returning...these huge numbers above 10000000
 Smelty: interseitng
 struct: with sqrt?
 struct: or withotu?
 Smelty: without the 3rd square and square root
 Smelty: so it should be okay, i just need to take the square root
 Smelty: (thanks)
 struct: np
 Smelty: yay I can now control drift
 struct: Smelty did you follow the csb "tutorial"?
 Wontonimo: where is the tutorial?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 Wontonimo: man, i wish i new about that months ago
 Smelty: didn't know there was a tutorial, but I'm just coding for the slcc currently
 Smelty: just started, so trying to use my strategy from csb
 Smelty: (hopefully get within top 100 at least.....:sweat_smile:)
 struct: my bot decided to quit <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539496166">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539496166</a>&#160;:(
 struct: I wonder if 0 thrust action is worth it
 Wontonimo: my bot does 100 thrust all the time
 Wontonimo: with no limit on turning, your bot can modulate its speed with rediculous turnbacks
 struct: yeah I think if it turns to opposite it should fix itself
 struct: 11^5 = 161051 vs 12^5 = 248832
 struct: its quite a difference
 struct: from just 1  move
 struct: Anyways its almost 4am
 struct: Im going to sleep now
 struct: Will make a push for it tomorrow
 struct: gn everyone
 Wontonimo: gn struct
 MDual: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31023f2c-a025-4d1a-a0ea-5a1674c5c229">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31023f2c-a025-4d1a-a0ea-5a1674c5c229</a>
 MDual: why would this fail?
 Wontonimo: what competition is that for?
 MDual: pod thingy
 Wontonimo: coders strikes back
 MDual: yea
 MDual: the second challenge
 Wontonimo: your last lineprint(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) +  str(thrust))
 Wontonimo: doesn't have a space between the y and thrust
 Wontonimo: should be print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) +  " " + str(thrust))
 Wontonimo: that's as far as i checked.  try that and come back
 MDual: oh it works hahaa
 Wontonimo: forif next_checkpoint_angle &gt; -90 and next_checkpoint_dist &lt; 20:
 Wontonimo: change it toif abs(next_checkpoint_angle) &gt; 90 and next_checkpoint_dist &lt; 20:
 MDual: it should be or?
 Wontonimo: and change it to or
 MDual: im done with the second challenge if i leaave and come back later would it reset my progress?
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: your progress is locked in
 Wontonimo: congrats MDual&#160;!
 Wontonimo: Illedan pretty tight race
 Wontonimo: in the great words of Megamind ... he wins some and then I almost win some 
 Smelty: lol
 Wontonimo: Hey Smelty, looks like you joined recently.  How did you find out about CG?
 Smelty: friend's recommendation

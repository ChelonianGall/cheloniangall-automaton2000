 HelloWorld183L: hi guys, I'm confused with the ASCII Art puzzle because it gives me the widths and heights of the letters as input, but it claims that all letters are the same height and width. What is the point of these inputs if they're meant to be the same (or is it meant to be the heights and widths of ALL letters in the input)?
 jacek: its per input
 jacek: different test case will have different width and height
 HelloWorld183L: ah right, thanks for clarifying
 jacek: i think i invented new game tree search
 jacek: jacekmax
 dbdr: it's the fashion, jacek :D
 dbdr: what does it do?
 jacek: no really, whats im using for othello isnt minimax nor mcts
 Astrobytes: prune array?
 jacek: it mostly resembles mcts w/ 0depth ept
 jacek: but i expand every children, make eval, then backpropagate eval to parents in negamax way
 dbdr: negamax backprop in MCTS is not new
 jacek: oh?
 jacek: i have no rollout, no 'score', only eval and visits
 MSmits: thats what I do in Oware and Onitama jacek
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: so its nothingn new? :scream:
 Astrobytes: (but Smits' is better than mine :P)
 MSmits: nope, but dont feel discouraged, it's pretty cool if you came up with that on your own
 MSmits: i didnt 
 MSmits: but, read more of my spamwalls, saves some time :P
 MSmits: i guess you can look them up now that chat is saved
 jacek: i thought you were talking about replacing rollout with just eval
 MSmits: what is the difference?
 jacek: nothing about backpropagating negamax way
 MSmits: oh I see
 MSmits: you're right that is somewhat different
 MSmits: but also not new, i've read about that
 MSmits: you need to be careful with the horizon effect
 MSmits: if depth varies
 dbdr: depth always varies in MCTS, no?
 MSmits: yeah, but his is not mcts
 MSmits: he's doing a minimax backprop thingy
 dbdr: it's a mcts variant
 MSmits: not exactly though
 MSmits: he's overwriting scores, not adding up
 dbdr: the depth variation comes from the exploration
 MSmits: with mcts the node gets multiple scores backpropagated to them and they average out to a bad or good value
 MSmits: he does a negamax backprop thingy and keeps the best/worst scores in minimax fashion
 MSmits: horizon effect might be much stronger in that case
 dbdr: the depth variation comes from the exploration
 dbdr: backpropagation is othogonal
 jacek: yeah, horizon effect, my bot is stronger against strong but weaker against the weak
 MSmits: what i mean is, eval goes up and down hard depending on whose turn i tis
 MSmits: if you backprop with ordinary mcts, this averages out
 jacek: odd-even effect
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i am wondering how this affects your backprop
 MSmits: you can include "who's turn it is" in your eval
 MSmits: mitigate this effect
 voidasi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a4431c3d-4b7a-49d1-bcee-3f54f8e507bf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a4431c3d-4b7a-49d1-bcee-3f54f8e507bf</a>
 MSmits: thanks voidasi
 MSmits: now he's spamming me emotes :P
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: it's what I get for responding to the troll
 dbdr: you got yourself a fan
 MSmits: yep, they are all positive emotes though
 MSmits: if I want to feel happy, I can just click on his tab
 MSmits: just finished converting my oware endgame DB
 MSmits: 4 GB
 MSmits: hope there's no bugs :P
 dbdr: wow
 MSmits: took 30 mins to generate in C++, then an hour to convert to something I can put in a C# persistent dictionary 
 dbdr: fixed number of seeds left?
 MSmits: yes, 15
 MSmits: any more than that and I get RAM-issues
 jacek: 15 seed left solved?
 dbdr: nice
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: now fit 4GB in 100K chars&#160;;)
 MSmits: I did this taking the 200 turn limit into account btw
 jacek: how many states is that
 MSmits: otherwise it's actually harder due to loops
 MSmits: lemme check
 dbdr: so how do you plan to use it? for meta-mcts?
 MSmits: 17383859 * 180 turns
 MSmits: so 3 billion
 jacek: i wonder if you could use supervised learning for NN for the endgame. you get perfect labels for endgames
 MSmits: dbdr yeah meta mcts
 jacek: and NN would 'compress' that
 dbdr: lossy compression
 MSmits: jacek, I suggested something similar to re curse before
 MSmits: just using the meta mcts states for supervised learning
 MSmits: so not exactly end game, but similar
 MSmits: he said it wouldnt work
 MSmits: dunno why, he didnt explain
 dbdr: he's using it now and doesn't want you to&#160;;)
 MSmits: hehe maybe, he doesn't lie I think though, just keeps some things to himself&#160;:)
 MSmits: which is fine
 dbdr: yeah, that's reasonable
 dbdr: lying would be very unethical
 MSmits: i can't really do that. I can barely keep things to myself
 MSmits: this meta mcts is messy though. I am using 3 different trees
 MSmits: top tree which is meta mcts, middle tree, which is my bot, then bottom tree which is the end game db
 MSmits: i guess that would work for any game which converges and has a fixed start
 MSmits: think this is how they solved checkers also
 dbdr: yes, they use endgame DBs
 MSmits: yeah, up to 10 pieces I think
 MSmits: crazy big end game db
 MSmits: btw dbdr, as for coding it into my oware bot. I do have a endgame db, but it's not hardcoded. I generate it in the first 1 second.
 MSmits: just 6 seeds
 dbdr: yes, had to be smaller :D
 dbdr: still nic
 dbdr: nice
 dbdr: does it make a big difference?
 MSmits: yeah, it helped a little bit i think, didnt hurt at least
 MSmits: sometimes I see re curse or another NN actually make a mistake according to the DB
 MSmits: i will draw a game i should have lost
 MSmits: or something like that
 MSmits: 6 seeds can be hard to solve still, because of the infinite loops
 MSmits: also I don't think they have a solver
 MSmits: and if they do, it just goes a few layers deep
 Hjax: hello everyone
 MSmits: hi
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475427702">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475427702</a> the boss timed out 
 Hjax: that doesnt seem good
 MSmits: darkhorse did say he had a timeout bug and he fixed it
 Hjax: can the boss be updated
 MSmits: probably
 MSmits: how often does it happen\/
 Hjax: not very often 
 Hjax: it just seems like something that should never happen
 MSmits: well i always get *some* timeouts due to timing inaccuracy on CG servers I think
 Hjax: i only search for 100 of my 150 ms 
 Hjax: because i time out otherwise 
 MSmits: wow that's a big buffer
 Hjax: i get huge GC pauses 
 Hjax: which kill me 
 MSmits: mmh you can try and use an object pool to avoid GC?
 Hjax: when i tried that it was super slow 
 Hjax: like, 1/5th the speed 
 MSmits: how is that possible?
 MSmits: you sure you did it right?
 MSmits: it should not be slower
 MSmits: unless java does something weird
 Hjax: java does many things weird 
 Hjax: this is why im trying to port to rust 
 MSmits: but I mean... an object pool is generated before the game starts
 MSmits: after that you're just referencing it
 Ashraful: Why rust over python? 
 darkhorse64: For the boss, I removed the solver. The timeouts I had were related to pass moves. This is not the case in the replay. I set my time limits very high 1000ms/150ms. May be a hiccup.
 Hjax: Ashraful python is horrifically slow 
 Hjax: and yeah thats what i did MSmits, im not sure why it was so slow 
 Hjax: java has to chase more references around i guess 
 MSmits: Ashraful:  Python = fast development, slow program. C++ or Rust or similar = slow development, fast program. 
 MSmits: speed is not always important. But for multiplayer arena's it often is
 Hjax: fast development fast program when? 
 MSmits: never&#160;?
 Hjax:&#160;:(
 MSmits: It helps if you're really good with rust I guess
 MSmits: skill also speeds up development
 Hjax: yeah rust seems like its possible to develop somewhat quickly in if you are good at it 
 MSmits: well faster than in C++ no doubt
 MSmits: c++ is a horrible language 
 Hjax: closures are really powerful, and lots of safe guards to prevent you from doing stupid stuff
 MSmits: as long as the safeguards arent slowing you down
 Hjax: become one with the borrow checker 
 MSmits: whats that
 Hjax: the bit of rusts compiler that enforces the ownership rules that make rust safe 
 MSmits: ah ok
 Hjax: new rust developers (like me) get into fights with it 
 MSmits: thats ok, as long as you win
 eulerscheZahl: yay, no more CoC invites!
 tomatoes: :tada:
 Hjax: i see euler has already changed his status 
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 Hjax: did automaton actually call you a noob?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, do you think my new tagline is a lie?
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN what's your memory on this?
 AutomatonNN: game is something to do
 Hjax: AutomatonNN is euler a noob? 
 AutomatonNN: efficiency to work with a hard time to use contest code
 Hjax: wow it didnt even ping you 
 Hjax: maybe its reformed 
 eulerscheZahl: it got some updates
 eulerscheZahl: initially it pinged me in 1 out of 4 sentences maybe
 boinkus: why does js do this to me
 boinkus: Found: "-0"Expected: "0"
 icecream17: Technically, -0 has a different "signed bit" than +0....
 boinkus: yeah but i want to die
 Hjax: thats not true for twos complement binary numbers 
 Hjax: which is the representation most (all?) programming languages use
 Hjax: do floats use a sign bit? 
 Hjax: i guess its true for floats, not for ints
 eulerscheZahl: CG is just comparing by characters, not actual values

 icecream17: no no no lol
 icecream17: ah. i see, i output '1 ' + sorted.join(' 1 ')
 icecream17: Yes! I'm gonna beat wood 2!!!!
 Ashraful: Search on google "Bangla meaning of huga"
 icecream17: hmm. i've never heard of bangla or huga...
 Ashraful: then search
 struct: Hjax where is the rus t bot?
 struct: tomatoes what are you currently using?
 Hjax: the rust bot will be done when i understand enough rust to finish it 
 Hjax: this weekend probably 
 Hjax: i didnt feel like working on it last night 
 tomatoes: mcts with evals
 icecream17: everyone's spawning in exactly the same place as me =/
 Ashraful: Everyone is spawning on huga
 tomatoes: not sure what's important and how much
 tomatoes: eval kinda manually bruteforced
 jacek: thats minimax :v
 tomatoes: but it has ucb1
 jacek: then tomatomax
 struct: so you go to certain depth and eval?
 Astrobytes: minimato
 Hjax: i think tomatoes is doing 0 depth evals now
 Hjax: just replaced the rollout with the heuristic function 
 DiL: hi! disableChat is back! very apreciated!&#160;:-)
 tomatoes: yes, and eval normalized to -1;1 and used as wins
 tomatoes: somehow it works
 tendai1km: cc
 Hjax: yeah i normalized to 0/1
 Hjax: i was wondering if its better to not normalize, and convert to some win&#160;% 
 Hjax: to make the algorithm favor paths that give bigger heuristic scores
 Astrobytes: Oware all over again
 jacek: well it starts with o
 jacek: as well onitama
 Astrobytes: Still to do Onitama
 MSmits: oltimate tic tac toe
 Astrobytes: ffs lol
 tomatoes: ucb skewed without normalizing
 MSmits: the exploration parameter can be used to normalize any score
 MSmits: the only reason to do something like this inside the eval is to cap the score so that it doesnt go out of hand in some specific situations
 tomatoes: i also have preffered and penalties there :expressionless:
 tomatoes: which decrease over visits
 MSmits: ah yes, well you'll need 1 less parameter than you have terms in your UCB
 MSmits: one can be 1, the others can be fitted
 MSmits: no point to having a constant in front of all of them
 tomatoes: and there is almost no random with eval, hard to bench locally vs old version
 Hjax: tomatoes you beat me in ide
 Hjax: with 3k playouts 
 Hjax:&#160;:(
 tomatoes: and i hardcoded first turn and set first to 2s 
 tomatoes: no need to explore other
 struct: do the 2 sec help anything?
 struct: or would 1 sec be neough
 struct: I just added it because Im bad and 1 sec isnt enough time for me
 Hjax: its nice for tree reuse 
 tomatoes: initialization is very fast, almost all 2s are usual mcts stuff
 tendai1km: loz me nghia
 jacek: yay for lucky oware resubmit
 Nazrul: okay, got it
 Astrobytes: nice jacek
 Spacekiddx: Any resource for learning DFS? anyone?

 Spacekiddx: Other than "geeksforgeeks"?
 JBM: oddly specific requirement
 JBM: what other reasonable resources should we exclude?
 JBM: probably wikipedia
 Astrobytes: CLRS. Definitely don't consult that tome.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: othello is being pain in my butt.  I can only get 3k nodes somewhere in the middle of depth 5 before timeout
 Astrobytes: Add an eval
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and it plays horribly compared to my board score (no deepth) evaluator
 Astrobytes: Use that eval at depth 4 and backprop it
 Astrobytes: Or write in C :P 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: White is Arena code (0 depth), black is min/max w/ max nodes at 2,837
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475457018">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475457018</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh sorry, I thought you were doing MCTS
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depth 4 @ 1,144 nodes still loses  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475457481">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475457481</a>
 Astrobytes: Well, something is wrong
 PatrickMcGinnisII: min/max might work at late game, but decisions in early mid game might as well be random
 struct: minmax depth 4 should always beat depth 0
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475457734">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475457734</a>
 Astrobytes: a/b minimax depth = whatever it reaches
 Astrobytes: You may be evaluating the wrong things, or evaluating the right things wrong
 jacek: or evaluating wrong things right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, i think my board scoring is a little wonky
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but its not getting deep enough
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so i guess I'll see how many i can get at MC
 Astrobytes: There's a guy in Wood 1 who had depth 4 minimax and was top in Wood 2
 jacek: plot twist: its aztrobytez
 Astrobytes: Nope
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've optimized the board and move finder routines ... i don't think alpha-beta is gonna get me any better
 Astrobytes: So don't give up on it Patrick
 Hjax: yeah if alpha beta is making your bot worse, you have a bug 
 jacek: passing moves error?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no was trying to think of new diresction...min/max is failing... I'll redo the eval, I'm using a weighted board
 Hjax: if your eval at depth 1 wins games, then minimax at depth 4 should win more games 
 Astrobytes: You can use the weighted board but definitely 100% don't make that your only eval
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Hjax I would think so too, hmmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm using a 16x8 board to weed out the movefinder better
 Hjax: wut
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eg.  if (($bindex&amp;136)^0) break;
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=10.1.1.144.543">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=10.1.1.144.543</a>

 Hjax: my movegen is just dumb7fill <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Dumb7Fill">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Dumb7Fill</a>
 Hjax: i mask off the edges from the propagator when doing horizontal directions 
 Astrobytes: ^same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx for showing u kicking my ass Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII osrry bud, just to remind you not to give up on alpha beta&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: *sorry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it works for all directions
 Hjax: i love how these bitboard things end up with magic numbers that you would never see otherwise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't be sorry i was actually thanking you, it shows me that i give up corners too easily
 Astrobytes: Yup
 Hjax: how else would i encounter a number like 9114861777597660798
 Hjax: which is essential to my move gen 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i started with 8x8, but too many comparisons
 Hjax: 8x8 is nice, fits in a nice 64 bit long
 jacek: jacekmax is ridiculus
 Astrobytes: You're used to bitwise manipulation Patrick, you'll love bitboarding
 jacek: some tweaks in eval + jacekmax = profit in onitama
 Astrobytes: Aha, going round updating all your bots eh jacek&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I am wasting storage 3k nodes take up 768k at 1 byte per cell
 jacek: this shit works and i dont know why
 Hjax: its very convenient that theres so many 8x8 board games, nice and processor friendly 
 Astrobytes: Don't question it jacek
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i timeout before hitting mem max
 jacek: well thats the essences of machine learning eh
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 Hjax: add enough constants and tweak them by hand and you have a really crummy neural network :D 
 Astrobytes: more of a neurosis network by the time your finished tuning by hand :P
 Astrobytes: *you're
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mcts has got to be better, if i dump everything into 3 stacks and cut the OOP, maybe i can get 20k sims.  Who's doing MC, how many u get?
 Hjax: me, about 10k in java 
 Hjax: about 30k with EPT 
 Astrobytes: OOP? What for?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if i drop the node class structure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: really kills cpu cycles in php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: EPT = GA?
 tomatoes: some sort of procrastination, tuning constants again and again instead of doing something useful
 tomatoes: happened in pacman's
 Astrobytes: That's a familiar story tomatoes&#160;:)
 tomatoes: ept = early play termination
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: EPT = early playout termination
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google, wth - EPT= Emerging Pandemic Threat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: WTH
 Hjax: i make 6 random moves, and then just return the result of an eval function @PatrickMcGinnisII
 Hjax: it made my program considerably stronger than full random rollouts
 Astrobytes: (within an MCTS framework that is)
 Hjax: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well at least I'm pinching those in the top 10 for info.&#160;;)
 jacek: so the entire league?
 Hjax: big benefit of multis over contests 
 Hjax: people dont keep as many secrets 
 tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475376559">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475376559</a> 47-48
 Hjax: fox blundered? 
 tomatoes: maybe bot shouldnt give up when solved for opponent :thinking:
 tomatoes: solved for his win, but then he made mistake
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't assume perfect play
 jacek: *game theorists triggered*
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 jacek: hmm hmmmm
 jacek: i had this game-&gt;makeMove(moves[moves.size()%rand()]);
 jacek: can you spot the thing?
 Hjax: shouldnt it be rand()%moves.size()
 tomatoes: swap
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: yes
 jacek: but it didnt crashed or anything. just some garbage board
 Hjax: i like how me and tomatoes point out the mistake 
 tomatoes: last
 Hjax: and Astrobytes just laughs 
 Astrobytes: It's jacek, ofc I must laugh
 dbdr: lol
 tomatoes: or not last. next after :thinking:
 Hjax: its amusing that C++ will happily just go off into memory somewhere and send you whats there
 Astrobytes: 'cause you told it to!
 Astrobytes: It's a feature :sunglasses:
 eulerscheZahl: python is boring, no fancy memory access at random locations
 Hjax: how about a more fun variant, a language that automatically takes&#160;% length of your index 
 Hjax: then youd never go off the end 
 Hjax: youd just get the wrong value from your array, and spend hours hitting your head against the wall 
 eulerscheZahl: Java2K is fun
 tomatoes: its useful, but not auto
 eulerscheZahl: only performs your commands with a certain probability
 Hjax: lol, havent heard of that one 
 Hjax: what does it do otherwise? 
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: functions returning incorrect results it seems
 Astrobytes: So you have to write your program to account for the fact that everything you call might be wrong. Hmm.
 Astrobytes: Intriguing exercise.
 Hjax: "The language uses a base-11 number system to approximate base 10"
 Hjax: oh no
 Astrobytes: Grim.
 dbdr: exercise: what's the distribution of N%(rand()%N)&#160;?
 tomatoes: error and 1..N-1 :thinking:
 Hjax: i would a script to test 
 Hjax: wrote* 
 Hjax: and i have no idea what this result is 
 jacek: i bet it has something to do with modulo vias
 jacek: bias even
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr asking almost the same question that i was asking myself :D
 eulerscheZahl: i was thinking about rand()&#160;% rand()
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dbdr only uniformly distributed in Java ... everything else g/l
 Hjax: so i wrote a script to count how many times each result of 100&#160;% i comes up in range 100
 Hjax: and i got a sequence ive never seen before

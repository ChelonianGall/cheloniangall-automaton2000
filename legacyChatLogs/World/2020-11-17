 Borrow: Which crates are available to a Rust submission?
 LordSkaven: @Borrow from the FAQ, chrono 0.4.9, itertools 0.8.0, libc 0.2.62, rand 0.7.2, regex 1.3.0, time 0.1.42
 KPlanas: Hi allQuick question as I'm new to thisWhat happens in Silver?Do we just compare codes to see who wins the most?
 LordSkaven: sortof, there are no new rules in silver, the bots just become more closely matched
 rockstar555: good night to everybody
 KPlanas: Oh okNo boss or anything then?Even when the Gold League opens?
 LordSkaven: the boss is chosen from one of the players basically.
 spaceorc: @pedrosorio also check is you have hardcoded spells (like I do) - they were changed a day before - and my bot started to throw IndexOutOfRange exceptions
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/itigo_purokonn">https://twitter.com/itigo_purokonn</a>that's an active twitter user :o
 LordSkaven: lol
 KPlanas: Ok, thanks for the info LordSkaven :grin:
 qahmad: is AI lap allows in this challenge?
 qahmad: hii
 [CG]Maxime: Hello!
 xineohp: not sure why my c++ code is running slower than the js code. smh
 struct: Hi
 MadKnight: hihi
 MadKnight: xineohp gg
 Vischtor: Hi, question about running your code locally:I cloned the git repo and used maven to install it, and get a .jar-file. But when I try to run the jar-file I get the following error:no main manifest attribute, in target/fall-2020-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jarAny hints about what to do?
 pedrosorio: spaceorc interesting, I do not hardcode, was just trying to understand how my bot gained 100 ranks overnight - if there were a lot of bots with hardcoded spells that could be another explanation
 MadKnight: just create a main manifest
 AntiSquid: eulerscheZahl are all the japs doing atcoder? did you do any atcoder challenges?
 MadKnight: ohhh so they added bonus rupees cost to the input cost now
 pedrosorio: MadKnight what does that mean?
 AntiSquid: really? where is it MadKnight&#160;?
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/commit/4b0d2c21899817af91cce2817c9fe3facfb9c1cf">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/commit/4b0d2c21899817af91cce2817c9fe3facfb9c1cf</a>
 AntiSquid: the first two BREW recipes pedrosorio have bonus
 AntiSquid: aha. cool @MadKnight
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have an account on atcoder
 eulerscheZahl: their contests are in the middle of the night for me
 Q12: Is C# is faster than Js?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Q12: ... I guess I need to change all my code to C# :sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: change to rust / c++
 AntiSquid: rust doesn't crash in the IDE anymore it seems
 Q12: don't know
 AntiSquid: best time to learn :P
 AntiSquid: tutorialspoint rust / c++
 AntiSquid: easy translate
 Q12: It would be hard and would take me a lot of time and until I will do it the contest will be over 
 Q12: so I will try to convert my code into C#
 S-Maitland: general question - is c# or c++ better than Java?
 Illedan: Both is better.
 S-Maitland: in what ways, or is it a long list
 Illedan: Faster at least
 S-Maitland: i'm familiar with Java but haven't touched on c# or C++ and wondered what would make more sense to learn
 Illedan: C# would be a fairly easy switch
 struct: Throw a dice
 S-Maitland: haha
 S-Maitland: eenie meanie minie mo
 S-Maitland: ok will look at C#, cheers&#160;:)
 struct: rigged, roll again
 S-Maitland: lol
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan are you sure that C# is faster than Java?
 Illedan: Nope :D
 Illedan: Random internett post said so

 eulerscheZahl: unless you write your bot in regexes
 LordSkaven: is that your idea for the next contest euler? Regex only bot lol
 Illedan: Code like that Calm winner :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: strings everywhere. i was shocked
 Illedan: Code to give nightmares
 eulerscheZahl: i still have it somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: found it
 eulerscheZahl: did i break my bot or did lower ranks improve?

 RockyMullet: oh chat is alive again&#160;?
 RockyMullet: good
 CodyPro: hello world&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl little question, I do around 16k sims and generally only go depth from 3-5, seems like not enough I feel I need to reduce my branching. You feel 16k is too much for so little depth&#160;?
 RockyMullet: oh no euler is gone
 struct: poor rocky
 RockyMullet: :cry:
 struct: how much time do you use rocky?
 RockyMullet: I stop at 39 ms because of random timeouts
 RockyMullet: but I feel it's false time out due to the servers not feeling right
 RockyMullet: I feel like 16k sim is too much for such a small depth
 struct: So you are pruning to only use 7 per state
 RockyMullet: I think I dont eliminate enough branching
 RockyMullet: so im not
 RockyMullet: should I&#160;?
 struct: Im not sure, I dont have working bot yet
 RockyMullet: I dont have much actions I do do every time. I dont rest twice, I dont sim exausted spells
 RockyMullet: dont do *
 RockyMullet: other than that it's every actions after every action each depth
 RockyMullet: I feel I should ignore some actions
 struct: My problem is how to choose which ones are bad
 LordSkaven: I think max nodes I reach is around 5k on depth of 8, but I almost never reach depth 8, usually stop at like depth 4/5. But I am using the LSFIIKS Algorithm.
 RockyMullet: I though about only casting the learned spell after I learn a spell since there's no reason to elarn a spell in a sim if im not casting it, but then the tier0 exchange of taxes could matter
 struct: Maybe learn it only on  depth 1?
 RockyMullet: yeah I do a kind of mutated bfs
 struct: only allow spells to be learned on depth 1 of bfs
 RockyMullet: struct yeah thats what I though, but it eliminate all the exchange of tier0 from taxes and it could matter
 Q12: did you take into account that situations that you already encountered you don't need to explore them again?
 RockyMullet: Q12 well I dont learn a spell twice
 RockyMullet: or brew twice
 struct: But if you cast spell 0 and spell 1
 struct: you get the same state as if you cast spell 1 and then 0
 RockyMullet: but a spell a learned spell can be casted
 RockyMullet: the only "I never check you ever again" I have is for brews, since they never matter after
 RockyMullet: struct true
 RockyMullet: yeah maybe it's something I could look up
 RockyMullet: thanks guys
 RockyMullet: it matters if one of those are the first depth since it changes the actual output
 RockyMullet: but beong that, there's no change
 RockyMullet: unless it's learning spell or brewing
 Q12: I am not speaking about it. if you got to a specific inventory and you explore all actions from there and you encounter the same specific inventory again you can skip exploring it. did you understand?
 RockyMullet: but cast 0 then 1, or 1 then 0 doesnt change anything
 RockyMullet: Q12 it doesnt mean I have all the same exausted spell
 RockyMullet: BUT
 RockyMullet: oh
 RockyMullet: yeah I undersdtand now
 Q12: :ok_hand:
 RockyMullet: I can check if I could ever be able to cast it

 RockyMullet: ZarthaxX sim yet&#160;?
 RockyMullet: paulemploi Il le verrait aussi dans #fr
 Q12: do you guys have a quick way to discover what will be the inventory after casting some spell except of adding the inventory and the spell ingredients? will be very helpful  :slight_smile:
 ZarthaxX: just finding closest potion to make with bfs rockstar555
 ZarthaxX: RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: someone stoll "rock" autocomplete from me, this is war
 ZarthaxX: yeah, annoys me
 RockyMullet: Q12 so far I do that, just add all ingredients, but there's probably a better way
 RockyMullet: the max ingredient is 10
 RockyMullet: so 4 bits
 RockyMullet: 4 ingredient 16 bits
 RockyMullet: so you could probably do something with mashing everything in a single variable
 BrunoFelthes: empty?
 RockyMullet: and add them
 Q12: nice!
 RockyMullet: oh shit it can be negative too
 ITACIRE: hi 
 struct: I make all ingredients positive
 struct: but I have cost and gain
 RockyMullet: ooooh so you can have 16 bits for cost and 16 for gain and it still holds in a 32 bit
 <b>**RockyMullet scribbles furiously in his TODO list</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: struct Ingredient {uint8_t values[4];
 Counterbalance: union Delta { uint32_t value; char values[4]; }
 AllYourMCTS: whats the benefit of putting it in a 32 bit value?
 struct: Counterbalance way should be better
 Counterbalance: you can then test for negative values very fast
 RockyMullet: yeah unions seems like the way to go
 RockyMullet: same data, 2 ways of using it
 Counterbalance: the only downside is that checking for 10 ingredients requires another 4 adds, or a 5th byte
 RockyMullet: AllYourMCTS 32 is the size of an unsigned int in C++
 RockyMullet: Counterbalance I dont understand, 10 fits in 4 b
 RockyMullet: 4 * 4 ingredient types = 16
 RockyMullet: ooooooooh you mean like busting the 10 ingredients with a cast
 RockyMullet: shit, you're right
 RockyMullet: I wish you werent lol
 struct: I got lost
 struct: Im not understanding
 Counterbalance: you can do 16bit, but then adding the ingredients to the inventory requires shifting and masking..
 RockyMullet: struct mashing up the ingredient count in a single variable by doing some bit shift
 RockyMullet: you'll be able to just substract or add those variable
 RockyMullet: but like Counterbalance said, it means you cant just add everything when it's possible to go over 10 ingredient, therefore going over 4 bits
 RockyMullet: well
 RockyMullet: 4 bits max is 15
 RockyMullet: is tehre any spells who gives more than 5 of a single ingredient&#160;?
 struct: But there are cost of 6
 struct: or cost doesnt matter?
 struct: for recipes
 NitMpez: i was trying to store the 4*4 bit integers, but the problem that i ran into was handling the negative  deltas... 
 NitMpez: worked great for all positive values... failed miserably for me when dealing with negatives
 Counterbalance: the trouble with 4 bits is that it's signed range is -8 to 7, so you can't tell if 0x8 is +8 or -8
 NitMpez: yeah, i tried even bumping it to 4*5bit integers just because of that
 Counterbalance: lol
 Counterbalance: the 8bit version is certainly fast enough though
 NitMpez: haven't really worked with unions... so if you add those together... will it handle the sign correctly in the 8th bit.
 MadKnight: yea those are still s8's
 MadKnight: signed chars
 NitMpez: cool... will look into it...

 moon_invader: it will be too late
 AntiSquid: gold is tomorrow
 moon_invader: i am at the bottom of ranking

 AntiSquid: panic, wear a mask, lock indoors
 Q12: I think every one in the world follow your way :joy::sob:
 moon_invader:&#160;??
 DToTheE: @Cristinel, you probably got the email that silver opened, not that you were promoted, unless you're different than Counterbalance, struct, and me in that regard.
 Q12: &gt; moon_invader work hard and improve your bot :relaxed:
 AntiSquid: work smart, not hard
 Q12: yeah, u right
 Clagus: what if working smart is hard?
 Clagus: :D
 moon_invader: is 5 days enough to study game theory??
 AntiSquid: i see we're having a dissenter in here ... Automaton2000 take care of this individual
 Automaton2000: i dont know much about it

 AntiSquid: you can read the whole 400-500 pages in one day though&#160;!
 moon_invader: so, back to work
 TheOtherAKS: hello guys, is it possible when playing a [Community Puzzle] to see what the computer input is&#160;?
 arkwaw: you could use debug output to print input, like cerr&gt;&gt; in c++
 TheOtherAKS: is that possible in Python&#160;?
 struct: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 TheOtherAKS: thank you sir .
 WINWINWIN: Looking at emil. and some of the top new guys, are contests easy to pick up if you join as a skilled coder?
 LordSkaven: probably
 LordSkaven: I consider myself an average/below average programmer and I am constantly in the top 300/200
 WINWINWIN: Its not the after you settle in part, its when you just start, can you pick up the contests easily?
 LastRick: I'll offer the counter argument. I've coded forever but this is my first contest. There are a lot of things to consider (with regards to game theory) that you don't think about if you're just coding for work.
 LordSkaven: In short, yes I think that if you are a skilled programmer it is relatively easy to pick the contests.
 LastRick: I would agree. 
 sadakatsu: I find that I excel in professional programming and struggle with these contests.  It feels like there is some knack for seeing "simple" tricks to get better algorithms that I do not see.  The brute force solutions are usually all that occur to me  : /
 sadakatsu: AFAIAA, my resulting code also tends to be roughly five times longer than the top entries, too.
 sadakatsu: I do a lot less with so much more work.
 LastRick: Totally understand. So, again, my first contest, brute force got me to Bronze. After that, I started watching Euler's game and trying to understand WHY is he choosing to do X (LEARN, CAST, BREW), or WHY NOT? I watched the default AI a lot. And you start to pick up clues about where to attack.
 VizGhar: Ain't nobody got time for this :D
 AntiSquid: for a moment i read "professional excel programming"
 CommanderCero: good i wasnt the only one
 LastRick: Big difference between this and writing VBA macros
 AntiSquid: import pandasql , query the table in sql code within python code @_@
 Cuken: Can I see what action my opponent took last turn given the input of this turn outside of "OPPONENT_CAST"
 Cuken: Or do I need to evaluate game state to figure that out
 Clagus: do you feel like buying recipes isn't really well designed? like buing top recipes is very expensive, so you probably just have to buy the cheapest anyway?
 sadakatsu: Right now, I only buy a recipe if it reduces my distance to my current goal this turn.
 Clagus: interesting, thanks&#160;:)
 EladYaniv01: is a LEARN delta  the same as any other delta,  meaning the negative values are what it costs  ?
 GiraffeKing: Yea
 Zilvester: EladYaniv01 - yes
 rwilson: EladYaniv01 - keep in mind that the COST to LEARN is related to the TAX and it's tome index ...   but once you've learned it, that DELTA is how the spell will behave ( i.e. it turns into a 'CAST' available or you next turn )
 VizGhar: No it is not... learn cost is equal to tomeIndex&#160;:)
 VizGhar: and you will receive tax after learning the spell
 Clagus: how can I track the +3/+1 bonuses? game does not provide such inputs, right? so how can I tell if my opponent is brewing something? it's easy when he is brewing different potion than myself, but what if we brew the same potion? how can I detect this?
 ErikBrendel: yes, they are inputs
 ErikBrendel: they are in the tomeIndex for orders
 rwilson: Clagus - it's jammed into the tome_index ...  was added late, so it's weird.   read description carefully.
 Zenoscave: good to know!
 Clagus: oh! :D
 Zenoscave: didn't see that
 Clagus: nice hack xD
 rwilson: Clagus - key point,  it's INCLUDED already in the price... so in some sense you don't really care.   you have to subtract the bonus from PRICE to get the base price.
 Clagus: wait, really? it's already included in the price?
 sadakatsu: Yes.
 Clagus: oh I see, nice
 Clagus: much less effort then&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbf0d2UHLrQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbf0d2UHLrQ</a>
 ErikBrendel: thank you rwilson, didn't know that
 Cuken: Except if you are past the first 4 recipes being purchased in slot 1 or 2, the price will now reflect it without the bonus
 Clagus: wait what?
 ErikBrendel: yeah sure, because there is no bonus anymore after 4 recipes
 Clagus: what about +1 bonus?
 Cuken: It would be nice to know what action your opponent took rather than analzying game state
 EladYaniv01: so a spell is in the Tome first index,   i literally see i can afford it, and the surplus wont go over 10 in my inventory , but the game sais i dont have enough ingredients,  why is that&#160;?
 rwilson: EladYaniv01 - 'not enough ingredients' implies you are trying to learn a spell where the tax is higher than the number of blue resourses you have ..   OR trying to CAST something you can't cast yet.
 VizGhar: not correct
 VizGhar: tax is amount of tier0 you will receive after purchasing spell
 VizGhar: spell cost is determined solely based on tomeIndex
 VizGhar: Only confusing thing visually is, that spell with tomeIndex=0 is shown on bottom of the list&#160;:)
 rwilson: EladYaniv01 - if it's for your LEARN, you might double check which way youre reading the tome index ( i had it backwards my first go , when tryign to learn the FREE one )
 EladYaniv01: omg yeah
 EladYaniv01: thanks guys
 VizGhar: Second last item in tome costs 1 (and has tomeIndex = 1) and if there is any tax, you will receive it AFTER you purchase spell
 VizGhar: if you cant store tax it will be discarded (not 100% sure about this one)
 EladYaniv01: thank you very much, i wish the instructions were more clear about it @VizGhar
 rwilson: VizGhar - yes - excesses are discarded
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 Barimehdi77: in the inventory there's a for loop loop twice which one is mine
 struct: first
 rwilson: Barimehdi77 - YOUR inventory is always first , regardless of if you are the RED or BLUE witch.

 GiraffeKing: Click on your league above the game screen
 Xenoid: In 22 hours
 hbouillo: Oh yeah, thank you!
 Barimehdi77: i write this func to check if the potion is ready but I don't know why it doesn't work 
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b40edb6-0d20-4a57-9235-ae266d198a78">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b40edb6-0d20-4a57-9235-ae266d198a78</a>
 Xenoid: The inequalities are wrong. Consider what happens if brows.delta_0 is -2 but inv.inv_0 is 1. Your inequality succeeds but you want it to fail
 CommanderCero: yeah the mistake is that if you negate your inventory a larger value will become smaller.For example delta=-2 and inv=3-3 is smaller than -2
 AntiSquid: what search depth are people at&#160;? :o
 Clagus: just write it more human friendly... don't try to invent smart checks, if you can just write it as you think it: inventory should be more than the demand
 CommanderCero: ive got 40 but im pruning like crazy, before that i was at 6
 Xenoid: My search depth is 4, which is probably why I cannot seem to break into the top 50 anymore
 struct: what rank are you Xenoid?
 NinjaDoggy: my low search depth is like 10, goes up to 20ish 
 Xenoid: I was ~70 before I submitted recently
 NinjaDoggy: but I don't have opponent sim yet...
 NinjaDoggy: so deeper is worse lol
 emh: hey guys
 emh: just started contest
 struct: top 70 with depth 4  seems very good

 Xenoid: I'm happy with my sim and scoring, but I don't think it's enough
 emh: AntiSquid entering Bronze soon so good I think&#160;:)
 CommanderCero: depth is quite vague anyway, depending on how you prune you may prune away important branches and still reach high depth
 NinjaDoggy: 0 pruning for brew/cast
 eulerscheZahl: Barimehdi77 only print 1 command each turn
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you have time to auto-promote to gold too emh&#160;:)
 Xenoid: Depth isn't vague when you are exhaustive :D
 emh: hehehe
 CommanderCero: yeah but that take so long&#160;:(
 emh: started a new job
 Barimehdi77: That's what I did 
 emh: it's only 2 days per week so far though
 emh: so still have some time for contest
 AntiSquid: what job&#160;?
 emh: IT consultant
 Barimehdi77: browdone print only if the potion is ready
 AntiSquid: cool

 eulerscheZahl: oh, the bottom block is in a comment
 Barimehdi77: is this right

 emh: it's only apprenticeship so far though. through the government and friends
 AntiSquid: "brows"
 Barimehdi77: this func check if I have the potion ready
 AntiSquid: it's a good start lol emh
 Xenoid: Barimehdi77, yes
 emh: AntiSquid thx&#160;:)
 Barimehdi77: but why I get timeout 
 CommanderCero: thats probably not the fault of the function
 AntiSquid: do you have any error message Barimehdi77&#160;? 
 emh: Bronze strat just some ifs throwing random spells for all potential brews. double loop
 AntiSquid: you probably need to take out code piece by piece to find out - annoying but only way 
 emh: are people bit-optimizing the hell out of this contest already?
 Counterbalance: of course
 emh: hehe
 Barimehdi77: Barimehdi77 has not provided 1 lines in time.Barimehdi77 was disqualified.
 LordSkaven: hmm, I wonder if maintaining Top 300 would guarantee promotion to Gold tomorrow 
 CommanderCero: I did that, it made it a lot faster but I dont think its necesary
 AntiSquid: do you have a choice? looks like an optimization multi .
 AntiSquid: LordSkaven probably
 Barimehdi77: i write this to see if the potion is ready 
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/622eae25-c981-4e01-ac58-507a654fb4cf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/622eae25-c981-4e01-ac58-507a654fb4cf</a>
 eulerscheZahl: probably not AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: it's just legend that's always hardcore
 Barimehdi77: brewdone func
 AntiSquid: why not euler&#160;?
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b356d5c2-698a-48fb-b314-0d6bcaaebb4e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b356d5c2-698a-48fb-b314-0d6bcaaebb4e</a>
 AntiSquid: 300/1400 for gold, don't see the issue :P
 eulerscheZahl: i predict a stronger silver boss, around 100-150
 Counterbalance: your brewdone function returns void, how can you compare it to 0?
 struct: I think 100 aswell
 eulerscheZahl: then lots of later promotions
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e25048a-171f-47b7-896e-be741e8282c3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e25048a-171f-47b7-896e-be741e8282c3</a>
 AntiSquid: max 200 for silver box . like really worst case scenario
 Barimehdi77: this is my brewdone func
 AntiSquid: boss *
 eulerscheZahl: can Icebox beat the silver box?
 AntiSquid: they are usually lenient with the silver boss
 AntiSquid: idk, what is stronger? silver or ice&#160;? Icebox
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5836880-2e12-48cb-9e3a-807276b8e80a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5836880-2e12-48cb-9e3a-807276b8e80a</a>
 AntiSquid: euler why do you expect a really strong gold boss&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i mean silver boss *
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't call that "really strong"
 AntiSquid: it would be stronger than usual for silver
 eulerscheZahl: that's just how it is from my limited memories (i never cared too much about it)
 eulerscheZahl: we'll see tomorrow
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN what do you think?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 AllYourMCTS: are you guys doing depth test with all pairs of actions? :O
 eulerscheZahl: we just broke the 6k mark
 ZarthaxX: :clap:
 eulerscheZahl: with pruning
 BrunoFelthes: what kind of algo is good to check simultaneous turns?
 BrunoFelthes: is minimax works?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm frustrated, can't climb up anymore. but even sure if i broke my bot or not
 eulerscheZahl: it's mostly a single player optim game
 NinjaDoggy: C# hitting its limits?
 NinjaDoggy: or just lack of ideas?
 struct: Still enough time to change 
 eulerscheZahl: no, toad hitting the limits
 BrunoFelthes: kkkk
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 struct: euler do you think it would perform better with c++?
 eulerscheZahl: yes but not that much
 eulerscheZahl: top players beat my by algo, not my language
 eulerscheZahl: beat me, by languagecan't type
 eulerscheZahl: bedtime
 struct: gn
 AntiSquid: 7 PM&#160;? 
 NinjaDoggy: gn euler
 AntiSquid: ah 
 AntiSquid: gn
 BrunoFelthes: probably 50k simulations is enough to find a good path...
 AntiSquid: euler is the early bird
 eulerscheZahl: 8:40 pm
 NinjaDoggy: lol time zones are so wack
 NinjaDoggy: i just woke up 11:40 for me lol
 AntiSquid: what counts as good BrunoFelthes&#160;?
 BrunoFelthes: legend league at the end
 NinjaDoggy: yeh 50k is not bad
 AntiSquid: this game might be UTTT 2
 NinjaDoggy: i'm getting roughly 120k
 BrunoFelthes: what 120k?
 BrunoFelthes: and you are not top 50? something is wrong
 BrunoFelthes: i'm doing 5k
 NinjaDoggy: i'm not simming opponent yet
 NinjaDoggy: top 20 today probably
 BrunoFelthes: are you using some trick with bits to do it faster?
 AllYourMCTS: 50k complete single player game simulations??
 AntiSquid: reveal thy trick
 NinjaDoggy: um... i guess i don't mind sharing...
 NinjaDoggy: talked about this a few days ago too
 NinjaDoggy: but basically you only have 1001 inventory states
 NinjaDoggy: so you can precompute all possible transitions
 BrunoFelthes: hummm
 NinjaDoggy: I started with bit manipulation too
 CommanderCero: i think he means forward model calls. Because i can also reach around 200k
 NinjaDoggy: but it's more complex and faster
 NinjaDoggy: slower*
 CommanderCero: also thats an interesting approach
 NinjaDoggy: yea forward model calls is a good way to describe it
 NinjaDoggy: anyone know of a faster alternative to unordered_set&lt;int&gt;
 AllYourMCTS: forward model calls as in applying 1 action to the sim?
 NinjaDoggy: that's specific to integers?
 CommanderCero: an array
 NinjaDoggy: but like it's too big for array&#160;:(
 CommanderCero: that is lare enough
 CommanderCero: oh
 NinjaDoggy: let's say 2^30
 NinjaDoggy: and all i need is to know if the integer exists, and to add new integer
 CommanderCero: transposition table, still an array but you compute an hash
 CommanderCero: and hope that you never encounter the same index twice
 NinjaDoggy: ok...
 NinjaDoggy: so bloom filter with k=1
 CommanderCero: mcts yes forward model call = advancing game by 1 round
 AllYourMCTS: ahhhh
 Zenoscave: for sim is anyone using learns in the sim path?
 Zenoscave: I've got maby 20k in 50ms
 Zenoscave: I think I need a refactor
 NinjaDoggy: planning on simming learn on first turn only
 AllYourMCTS: what is learns?
 Zenoscave: LEARN from tome
 AllYourMCTS: oh
 Zenoscave: Probably GC is killing me
 AllYourMCTS: i'm doing random game playouts with all possible actions
 ParticleBeam: So am I. It's not working all that well anymore...
 AllYourMCTS:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: I need to find a way to locally allow ony one thread on C# my timings are less than accurate to the servers
 motty: So, I've been promoted to the Bronze League and I don't know why - my code was definitely not cutting it for Wood League 2. This is weird.
 pedrosorio: (...) not cutting it for Wood League (...)
 GiraffeKing: ha
 motty: :sunglasses:
 wlesavo: Zenoscave i do, but with raw MC
 Zenoscave: huh wlesavo
 wlesavo: Zenoscave did you fix recepie update?
 Zenoscave: raw mc?
 Zenoscave: why?
 wlesavo: you had a broken bot today
 Zenoscave: and no. there's an update?
 Zenoscave: replay?
 wlesavo: yes, check the new recepies, one was changed
 Zenoscave: I don't hardcode transitions
 wlesavo: oh
 wlesavo: i thought thats why you always timed out
 Zenoscave: No just no timeout checks. Just eval max count.
 Zenoscave: Might add timeout checks back
 wlesavo: Zenoscave i won almost all of games in arena against you like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504551047">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504551047</a> 
 wlesavo: i see, but there are some problems with timeouts for everyone, you should probably fix your checking
 Zenoscave: fair
 Zenoscave: thanks
 wlesavo: raw MC was first thing i tried, and then i got lazy
 wlesavo: but it is easy to add heuristics there, my is code somewhat pythonic
 wlesavo: my code is*
 S-Maitland: quick question, do you only move on from challenges if you defeat the boss in the arena, rather than just beating them in the "play my code" part
 Zenoscave: yes S-Maitland
 ForgottenSausage_431f: what
 S-Maitland: ok thanks Zenoscave&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: np
 Ekaon: Is there someone able to run the FallChallenge project outside CodingGame website&#160;?
 motty: Boss must have had... unfortunate rng luck  in the run that promoted me to Bronze sometime overnight  then.
 Zenoscave: Brutal tester Ekaon
 Zenoscave: you need to patch the source a bit though
 Traquila: How do you send messages in GUI?
 StrykerS: hi
 ForgottenSausage_431f: hello
 Ekaon: Yeah, this is where i'm stuck
 GiraffeKing: motty, you gotta do better than the bot would in 100 games; doubt it's 100 games of bad luck.
 Zenoscave: Traquila add a " " and then your message at the end of your turn move
 Traquila: thank you
 Zenoscave: Ekaon What's the error you're getting and what version of java do you run?
 motty: @GiraffeKing sure, but my code was happily accumulating tier3 ingredients like that was the goal and not even trying to make potions.
 Samer: motty i have the same problem lol
 Samer: actually my code is so broken it's amazing i made it to silver, or even bronze!
 S-Maitland: is it 100 GiraffeKing, i'm 50 games in and only at 20% battle progress
 GiraffeKing: S-Maitland, maybe not? Mine usually seems to have the&#160;% be the same as the games played, but I was only guessing based on that.
 ikadimi: can you add minmax to a js code without timing out&#160;?
 ForgottenSausage_431f: w
 ForgottenSausage_431f: w
 ForgottenSausage_431f: w
 Zenoscave: ikadimi yes but probably not very deep
 Zenoscave: plus minmax does not work well with simultaneous games like this
 ikadimi: what kind of algorithm is best then&#160;?
 Zenoscave: MC or beam search/bfs seems to be common
 Zenoscave: MC or MCTS
 Zenoscave: but again MCTS needs modifications for simultaneous turns
 ikadimi: alright thank you ima check them out
 StrykerS: poo
 struct: all depends on the depth
 struct: oh chat didnt scroll
 Zenoscave: beat you to it struct&#160;;:P
 struct: You are beating me everywhere&#160;:'(
 Zenoscave: what!? My bot currently times out too often
 struct: Doesnt matter even if you have 0% wins you are still ahed
 struct: Im still in bronze
 Zenoscave: ooof
 struct: But to be fair my bot is just MC
 struct: just to see if I had bugs
 S-Maitland: what does Mc mean?
 Zenoscave: monte carlo
 struct: Monte Carlo
 struct: Random search
 Zenoscave: probabilistic random choice
 S-Maitland: ah ok
 Zenoscave: just a sim debug then struct?
 struct: yes
 Zenoscave: wlesavo fixed my timeout. let's see how it does
 jamessizeland: timeouts are kicking my code too, can't figure out what's causing it
 KevinisMAD: You probably aren't finishing your computations fast enough
 AllYourMCTS: did they change it so when spells get added to your inventory they have a new id instead of the actual id?
 AllYourMCTS: i swear the spell ids were the same once added to inventory but now they are different
 Xenoid: It has always been that way, AllYourMCTS
 struct: they have never been the same
 Zenoscave: nope
 KevinisMAD: Response time per turn ≤ 50msResponse time for the first turn ≤ 1000ms 
 AllYourMCTS: oh wow
 jamessizeland: yeah I just dropped my search timeout 10ms and its working now
 struct: jamessizeland when do you start your timer?
 llllllllll: is there a way to see a stacktrace or sg when my code crashes?I get random "timeouts" when I clearly have time remaining, but no error message, nothing
 llllllllll: (C++)
 KevinisMAD: Honestly I am trying to build a dp table during the first turn and adding when I learn but it is still timing out
 KevinisMAD: Could be you aren't returning an action by the end of a turn
 jamessizeland: I'm just limiting my search algorithm to 30ms
 llllllllll: I don't get to the end, it fails somewhere, but I cannot find where
 rohit523: Which league are you guys on??
 KevinisMAD: Silver
 jamessizeland: silver
 rohit523: im on wood 1&#160;;(
 KevinisMAD: Just try to test out ideas you think work youll move up pretty fast
 rohit523: just finished coding wood 1 testing in battle
 KevinisMAD: Although some of these later rules require a bit more computation and data structures knowledge
 rohit523: ohh okay
 arkwaw: I still don't get how there can be only ~1000 inventory combination, someone mentioned that. If we have a,b,c,d each &lt;=10 and a+b+c+d&lt;=10
 arkwaw: that is ~81754 valid combinations
 Zenoscave: some aren't represented by the inputs
 Zenoscave: *many
 Icebox: wait what
 Icebox: who's silver box
 rohit523: My logic for wood 1 was that i sorted vector according to price/moves and casted acc to that ... but is this the most optimal&#160;? 
 rwilson: arkwaw - interesting problem in itself&#160;;)    we start with 3 blue, but only have the 42 spells to do transformations with...   so some combinations might not be reachable  ( but then you've gotta expand due to extra tax income&#160;;) )
 arkwaw: i should assume that at some point i'll be able buy every single spell. Lets say pure green one Recipe(0, 0, 1, 0)
 wlesavo: Zenoscave well now you rec me
 arkwaw: with it and rest I can have all 0..10 greens
 arkwaw: we also have pure blue spell, pure red 
 arkwaw: so still all combinations should be possible
 emh: hmm.. I was printing too much. got timeouts because of it. I was limiting to 40 ms. so hot tip: don't print too much
 xSkyline: @rohit523 in the early levels you can (and should) beat the boss with whatever code is implemented the easiest. 
 wlesavo: Zenoscave oh, but still some timeouts in ide, or didnt you updated arena version yet? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504618067">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504618067</a>
 Zenoscave: I did update
 Zenoscave: still have a bunch of timeouts
 Zenoscave: Might rework to table
 wlesavo: dam
 rohit523: Ohh i see :sweat_smile:
 arkwaw: i'll have to think about it
 wlesavo: you didnt have this issue before right?
 Zenoscave: Yeah. but sims were much lower
 rohit523: i actually complicated my code too much to beat players in arena
 AntiSquid: my ifs dropped 200 spots tonight, people are aggresisvely improving
 rohit523: with trying to get an optimal approach
 emh: I have a basic C++ sim just over 200 lines. getting 300k-1mill simulations of combinations of spells to reach a brew. hope it will get me to Silver
 AntiSquid: lol
 jamessizeland: flip!
 AntiSquid: 300k-1mil&#160;? sounds like gold tier at least
 AntiSquid:  /flip jamessizeland
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 emh: I don't think it's comparable to other people's numbers as it's not full sims
 emh: just some hackish thingy
 emh: so far
 jamessizeland: I wonder how many permutations I'm searching... I'll check
 AntiSquid: forums down?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: emh, paths to all 5 brews are findable in &lt; 400 nodes if you ignore rests... 300k sims? i don't see how or why
 Gedzius: guys do you know if there's a given element which tells how many potions has your opponent brewed overall&#160;?
 emh: PatrickMcGinnisII it was easy to think about and code that's why hehe
 struct: 300k sims is possible
 LastRick: Antisquid: Agreed, impressive amount of improvement. My code is leaps and bounds better than what got me through Bronze (head to head testing). I've hardly moved in the rankings.
 emh: PatrickMcGinnisII interesting to hear that it can be done in so few "nodes"
 emh: though
 motty: A game that required deep lookahead would have implications for which languages were feasible.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1 brew alone is findable in &lt;80...do all5 at once...&lt;400
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top bots total game lengths are &lt;40
 SirLoxley: Is anyone else experiencing timeouts in battles ... and then when loading the params there's no timeout anymore?(Java)
 llllllllll: yep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 40 turns
 emh: damnit. fell below Bronze boss in my current submit. had a long loss streak
 emh: hope it will pass
 llllllllll: but for me its not timeouts, it crashes somewhere, since I don't get any error messages its hard to find
 jamessizeland: I was until I put time timing limits in
 LastRick: I've seen it in dart too. Timeout in the Arena, take it to IDE and its not there. A little annoying.
 SirLoxley: A bit hard to fix to be honest.
 raymoo: in haskell the timeouts I experienced were generally reproduceable
 rwilson: Gedzius - no. you'll have to figure out they brewed by noticing their score went up from last turn.
 llllllllll: is there any way to get an error message at runtime? (C++)
 Gedzius: rwilson - ok thanks
 raymoo: run yourself as a child process and read output(?)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top bots seem to be doing best first searches...at maybe 20k nodes ... someone tell me if I'm wrong?
 llllllllll: I do not have a local env set up
 Counterbalance: try / catch will catch some of them
 Gedzius: rwilson - wait there's isnt something that tells me about opponents score or am i missing something
 llllllllll: ah, good idea... im so dumb not to consider that, lol
 AntiSquid: LastRick what is your stable rank&#160;?
 rwilson: Gedzius - input gives you both players INVENTORY  &amp; SCORE on same lines --- yours is always 1st, enemy second
 SirLoxley: what annoys me even more with these timeouts ... each and every IDE replay ... I won&#160;:/
 LastRick: Squid: Around 75% silver, so currently ~1000
 Gedzius: rwilson - yea could you tell me the elements name. Is it actionCount&#160;?
 llllllllll: its the second iteration of the loop
 llllllllll: after the "items"
 llllllllll: (you are first, enemy second)
 Gedzius: ah shit what language are you coding by
 Gedzius: in python its action_id, action_type, delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, delta_3, price, tome_index, tax_count, castable, repeatable
 llllllllll: C++ and python
 llllllllll: the enemy score, etc comes after those
 Counterbalance: llllllllll segfaults aren't shown in the ide; you can trap SIGSEGV but that won't help much so you're better off running the bot locally in that case
 Gedzius: oh so do i need to ask for another input (this is my first real challenge)
 llllllllll: ah, right... I tried the trap, but it didn't really work, so I'm switching to local testing, thanks!
 GiraffeKing: Do we get some input that tells us the other witch's last action?
 motty: Serious kudos to anyone doing this in not-a-scripting-language. Debugging must be srsly hard.
 Counterbalance: F5
 GiraffeKing: Doing it in C# and debugging has not been so hard.
 GiraffeKing: Just a ton of Console.Error.WriteLine() when things don't do what I want, and then examining the output.
 llllllllll: but its sometimes hard to debug that one function that runs 23k times a round :P
 emh: 1st yay. in Bronze. hehe :p
 GiraffeKing: Welcome to Silver, then!
 emh: thank you :D
 GiraffeKing: The top bots in here are pretty smart. I'm not sure I can even come close to the top 500.
 llllllllll: my bot is very dumb &amp; I was around 600 before I messed up my code... so it should be possible :P
 AntiSquid: it's Tuesday and there are 6.1k nearly ... geez this contest is big
 arkwaw: oh shit i got it
 arkwaw: why we have so little combinations&#160;;)
 arkwaw: thanks
 GiraffeKing: I thought my bot was kinda smart, but it's not thinking very many steps ahead. It doesn't know how many steps away any brew is, it just knows which one has the best gain/cost ratio.
 GiraffeKing: So, I think it might actually be pretty dumb.
 rohit523: giraffe which league?
 GiraffeKing: Silve
 GiraffeKing: Silver
 rohit523: hmmm
 Blend-77: lol I just got into wood 1 I just started today tryna maker an algorithm to do spells :D
 rohit523: same lol
 Blend-77: make a*
 AntiSquid: you can do top 500, even top 300 for sure, the hard part comes this weekend :P
 AntiSquid: GiraffeKing
 Blend-77: I mean I made one to take all possible actions and depict the best one
 Zaphus: Giraffe - mine is similar, only looking 3 moves ahead, still good enough to keep me in the top 250 for now
 Blend-77: shouldnt be too hard
 GiraffeKing: I donno, this is the first bot I have ever written, so I am not sure I'll get too much better than 1,000. I'm gonna start thinking about trying to make it figure out how many steps away the brews are and use that number to determine which brew is best to go after.
 SirLoxley: how long does it usually take before any new submission can be considered somewhat stable concerning rank?
 LastRick: Same here. First contest ever, just happy to have made it to Silver.
 LastRick: I can put that on the resume now, correct?
 GiraffeKing: SirLoxley&#160;; it feels like half an hour
 rohit523: lol is there certificate for this xd?
 LastRick: HAH
 GiraffeKing: My last arena test was 34m ago, and I am 63% done battling.
 LastRick: I was under the impression you can leave the arena before it is done and effectively it keeps testing it. Is that so?
 GiraffeKing: Yes.
 LastRick: Good. Who has the time to sit through that?!&#160;:)
 GiraffeKing: Nobody. Seriously, at this rate my current run will take an hour.
 jamessizeland: yup just took an hour
 PatrickMcGinnisII: better than yesterday... was twice as long
 LastRick: which stinks. but i guess also a good thing, if i understand the veterans correctly, this contest has been much busier than the average contest
 GiraffeKing: Well, it has the Koume and Kotake twins, so who can resist?
 Blend-77: I think I know how to do it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: K&amp;K meth chemists
 Blend-77: simulate the results of the spell and then check if it's the most optimal
 Blend-77: perhaps.
 LastRick: That's terrible, way off, dont do that
 LastRick: :P
 Blend-77: lol
 rohit523: 90% done and im rank 1 in wood 1.. what does it mean? i still came 2nd to some playerss lol
 LastRick: it means welcome to bronze
 Blend-77: lol
 rohit523: :joy:
 GiraffeKing: It means the magic behind score likes you better.
 GiraffeKing: I have seriously no idea how the score works.
 motty: I have no idea how my wood 1 code got promoted to Bronze. It shouldn't have done.
 AntiSquid: i'd pick dexter as my chemist, opponent can have both witches :P
 rohit523: Yeeahh lel
 AntiSquid: (breaking bad reference btw)
 GiraffeKing: Was it? I feel like if you were gonna reference breaking bad, you're want Walter, right?
 AntiSquid: oh got shit mixed up hahah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: these walter white mofos kicking my butt in 30 turns ... yea, wtf
 Astrobytes: Gale was pretty shit hot too
 AntiSquid: seen the boys btw&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: the superhero one
 Astrobytes: Not yet, still on the list
 AbundantPuddle: Were you referencing Dexter from "Dexter?"
 Astrobytes: Quite looking forward to it
 AntiSquid: no . mixed up names from 2 different shows AbundantPuddle
 AbundantPuddle: The first season was really good Astro
 Astrobytes: Either that or Dexter's Laboratory
 JamesOConnor: Battle progress takes sooo long
 JamesOConnor: I just wanna rank up
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've heard AbundantPuddle
 JamesOConnor: You guys got any tips for the this contest? I think I might try it soon once I have finished the game I am no 
 JamesOConnor: on*
 Blend-77: shit gota do skewl -_-
 Redlander: i'm at wood 1; slightly better than the bot, but that seems to be enough :D
 Majeck: How many people will get into Gold?
 Majeck: I think 600 and up will
 LastRick: It was 1000 for silver, right?
 Majeck: I'm still not sure if my bot will be able to do it, sitting between 700-800
 Majeck: Yeah about 1000 for silver but I think that was mostly a numbers coincidence
 LastRick: You're really improving
 Majeck: Not really lol
 Majeck: Just sheer luck
 LastRick: hah
 Majeck: This same bot was in 900 yesterday
 Majeck: So I don't know whether it faired better in the long run or everyone else got worse lol
 LastRick: i'm basically staying the same, as more people come in, i slide back. ALways around 75%
 Majeck: 75% what?
 LastRick: 75% of the number of people in silver
 LastRick: I said to Squid earlier I think peoples code is really improving
 hbouillo: Yes, and that's the reason why we slide back a little all the time :D
 LastRick: tell me about it!
 mlemm: because you spend time chatting :D
 LastRick: true
 mlemm: jk, have a great day
 hbouillo: I'm just here until my bot is properly ranked hehe
 mlemm: what rank we talking about hbou
 hbouillo: My best bot today got 115th, I'm trying to imrpove but it doesnt go past 300 right now
 NinjaDoggy: submits can be pretty random&#160;:/
 MattSOrme: Being impossible to debug constant random timeouts makes me just want to stop. So demotivated righ now
 Majeck: MattSOrme
 Majeck: I was having the same problem
 Zenoscave: Same here
 rwilson: MattSOrme - have you added a 'bail out now i'm almost out of time' check yet?
 RockyMullet: reaching depth 8, progress&#160;! :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try PHP, Whiners!
 hbouillo: Timeouts are hard to deal with yep... I don't suppose there is any profiler tools on codingame?
 Majeck: At the end of whatever loop/recursion whatever you're doing just check the time and return if it's over 45 ms or something like that
 Zenoscave: don't check every time though check every 100th time or so
 Majeck: I just get the best answer I can in that time and If I don't find anything I go to a "Plan B"
 Zenoscave: time checks are slow
 MattSOrme: yep. And ive set it agressively low. Like 25ms. And it still just freezes somewhere. My turns finish anywhere from 25.1ms to 60+ms
 Counterbalance: garbage!
 Majeck: Zenoscave just a few ns in C#
 Majeck: You can doo +10000 in a ms
 Zenoscave: Really? with Diagnostics Stopwatch? or are you using a diff method
 Counterbalance: print the mem usage each turn and see if it's climbing and falling
 Majeck: DateTime.UtcNow
 Majeck: lol
 dreadylein: Oo
 MattSOrme: System.nanoTime and checking it at the start of every loop in my sim
 GiraffeKing: My thing finishes at 15ms most of the time; 25ms at the most.
 Majeck: I also heard they were slow but I looked it up and StackOverflow said they weren't thaaaat slow
 MattSOrme: Also checked Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() and says i only have 60mb, instead of the 700+ im meant to
 rwilson: MattSOrme - start of loop, as in before or AFTER you read first line of turn input?
 Zenoscave: Majeck good to know
 MattSOrme: my startTime is set after first input is read
 struct: Is DataTime reliable?
 struct: I never usd it
 Majeck: Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4075525/why-are-datetime-now-datetime-utcnow-so-slow-expensive">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4075525/why-are-datetime-now-datetime-utcnow-so-slow-expensive</a>
 rwilson: MattSOrme -&#160;:( ugh, sounds like you're possibly hitting a garbage collection pause then ... since it sounds like you're on ..  Java?
 Majeck: "You can call DateTime.UtcNow ~ 14,000 times for a cost of only 1 millisecond!"
 MattSOrme: any tips on how i ... don't hit GC?
 Zenoscave: static global array and use ValueTuples
 Majeck: Well DateTime hasn't failed me yet
 rwilson: MattSOrme - typically, you avoid NEW things&#160;;)     make a pool of stuff you want to use, or an array and use stuff from there.. 
 Majeck: Plus after putting it in my main recursive loop it cut timeouts from like 20% of matches to 0
 mlemm: anybody here using Bfs&#160;?
 jamessizeland: yup
 mlemm: worth it&#160;?
 MattSOrme: hmm. thats gonna take a lot of re-write im guessing haha. Gonna have to restructure everything if i need to avoid every possible new
 jamessizeland: working well enough
 mlemm: i regret writing in C lol, but i did it to prove a point to somone 
 Astrobytes: Which point?
 SirLoxley: give us a pointer
 mlemm: if i can get some decent rank in few days
 garrisonhh: int* p here you go
 Remus_: *segfaults*
 HackingHues: lol.... submitted my bot. completely falls on its face from 700 to the bottom... lol. guess thats a good place to stop.
 Astrobytes: that's a good place to improve
 Redlander: bronze league, here i come&#160;:)
 LastRick: Luckily we cant go backwards
 Astrobytes: congrats RedLander
 Remus_: We can't? nice
 MasterDuck: I have tried to improve my code, but it's too messy.  Have anyone just given up and started from scrach, or do you just keep trying? 
 Remus_: I restarted 4 times now
 LastRick: sometimes I try something, like Hacking, and splat it just fails miserably.
 RicksMLC: 3.5 times here
 LastRick: master, I restarted completely for silver
 Majeck: Me too
 Majeck: But in Bronze
 jamessizeland: always refactor as you go :p
 Majeck: Deleted all my logic code and started again
 JamieSims: what language are you all using
 LastRick: i think you have to. You couldn't predict what bronze or silver was going to be like, what would be important, so you have to start over every now and then
 Majeck: Then realized I could use that code as a plan B in case of timeouts lol
 Majeck: C#
 LastRick: Dart
 MasterDuck: ok, you are giving me some more motivation. I really want to come to gold this time. Thanks!
 JamieSims: Dart is the way for me
 mlemm: ehm C 
 ParticleBeam: Dictionary of a Tuple of a Tuple of ints pointing to a List of Lists...I think I need to simplify this..
 LastRick: really? You're using it too?
 Astrobytes: don't give up MasterDuck, keep going&#160;;)
 JamieSims: yeah im using dart
 LastRick: wow, there's so few of us. Can I ask why? (Flutter developer here)
 MasterDuck: Thanks, Astrobytes! 
 jomarko: Hi, please, does someone know what is the rule to proceed to the next league? 
 LastRick: no one knows, just try to get as high in silver as possible before tomorrow
 JamieSims: yeah haha thats why, ive tried messing round on flutter and thats the one i know the most about
 numb3r5: You have to rank above the boss after all the battles are simulated, i think
 jomarko: ok, fair enough, will do my best
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jomarko full rules at bronze
 Astrobytes: jomarko, you're in Bronze right? Be better than the boss as numb3r5 said. If you get in silver and want gold, you need to be near the top of the league
 jomarko: yes, I am in the bronze one
 Remus_: below like 30% again maybe
 mlemm: anybody got an idea what is the highest rank can "if else algorithm" achieve&#160;? just approximation
 Astrobytes: jomarko: Cool. You need more points than the boss, that doesn't mean you beat the boss 100%, you have to be better than the other players for the most part
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mlemm i got to bronze before i put in a tree
 Astrobytes: Depends on your logic mlemm, there have been many people in Legend league in many games with "just" if-else
 jomarko: Astrobytes: ok, lets see, simulation is at 50% and it is promising , I am the fifth in rank, but the end is far away still
 Astrobytes: well, good luck jomarko!
 rohit523: rohit523 has not provided 1 lines in time. Is this message for timeout?
 SirLoxley: yes
 hbouillo: to our crash
 SirLoxley: or crash
 rohit523: ohhkay
 hbouillo: or*
 Astrobytes: your submit looks fine, I think you're going to silver jomarko
 rohit523: ooo okay
 mlemm: Astro, im thinking about re-coding with c++ because i failed to write a working bfs algorithm with c.
 jomarko: Astrobytes: thank you, I found this challenge totaly randomly, but Like it totally
 mlemm: the thing is i didn't use c++ for few months and im affraid im gonna take a long time to recode
 hbouillo: mlemm Without any kind of simulation I don't think you can get into silver
 mlemm: im currently at silver @hbouillo
 Astrobytes: Just write C code with C++ advantages where necessary mlemm&#160;;)
 hbouillo: Oh that's actually impressive then mlemm&#160;!
 mlemm: thanks guys, imma go for it good luck&#160;!
 SelectNull: hbouillo - I'm in the silver withou sim. Just if-else 
 [CG]Thibaud: no need of sim for silver, even perhaps for gold
 Astrobytes: jomarko: awesome! Hope you'll stay and play some multiplayer games after the contest (there are user-created games and most previous contests become multiplayers after the contest ends)
 SelectNull:&#160;:)
 hbouillo: That's good to know!
 Remus_: can't find you mlemm&#160;:( wanted to see it
 hbouillo: I didn't really do the if/else one, so couldn't really tell!
 hbouillo: mlemm Nice school :grin:
 Astrobytes: [CG]Thibaud that's nice to know, I think I plan to be lazy in this contest :P
 SirLoxley: what's sim?
 hbouillo: simulation
 Astrobytes: A sim is just a simulated tick of the game
 Astrobytes: So, apply a move, simulate the result
 Astrobytes: tick == turn
 Astrobytes: You implement the mechanics of the game and apply them when you try a move 
 garrisonhh: does anyone know how to turn off the code suggestion
 garrisonhh: or can u not
 Astrobytes: Don't think so I'm afraid, I know it's a bugbear for a lot of people
 SirLoxley: just did. It's in the settings
 SirLoxley: (Beneath leaderboard)
 Astrobytes: "Accept suggestion on Enter key"&#160;?
 SirLoxley: having said that I don't use the editor. I am copy&amp;past guy
 SirLoxley: paste, too
 Astrobytes: Pasta type myself :P
 Zenoscave: I eat more paste than paste
 Zenoscave: pasta*
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that doesn't switch it off unfortunately
 Zenoscave: I'll let you decide which i meant
 Astrobytes: When I visit Sweden I eat more paste than pasta :thinking:
 Zenoscave: Same in the us
 Zenoscave: But I like cow hoofs
 mlemm: i like water
 Astrobytes: Hey, cow feet are cool. Well they were when I ate meat lol. Good ones are excellent incgredients. Just not in processed meat products.
 Astrobytes: *ingredients
 Zenoscave: I eat glue 
 Astrobytes: Fishbones!
 mlemm: what's the most random thing you can eat
 Astrobytes: Something you don't know about that someone you don't know just told you to eat.
 mlemm: i eat lamp shades
 Zenoscave: Given most edible things are uninteresting the chances are uninteresting
 phord: I keep pressing ^S to save before I run and my browsers asks me where to save.   :-(   How do I untrain me or train the editor to stop this?
 Zenoscave: If the random is uniformly distributed
 mlemm: im no more hungry now thank you zeno
 Astrobytes: lol Zeno. Not a food person then :D
 Zenoscave: I love food
 Zenoscave: But a hamburger is meant for eating. 
 mlemm: you said "Given most edible things are uninteresting"
 Zenoscave: A lamp shade is more interesting though
 Zenoscave: perhaps uninteresting is the wrong word
 Astrobytes: Heh
 mlemm: i recently pickedup a habit on eating 2 apples a day
 Astrobytes: "statistically unusual in the group of eaten substances"
 mlemm: and man it really changes a lot
 Zenoscave: A thesis
 SpaceMoehre: does this website have a dark theme?
 Zenoscave: It has a light?
 mlemm: i think yes since im using one
 Zenoscave: I forgot
 Astrobytes: ^
 RicksMLC: "Settings"
 mlemm: define us "dark theme"
 RicksMLC: over there &lt;----
 Zenoscave: play my code? RicksMLC
 RicksMLC: Zeno: I would if mine was working right now
 RicksMLC: I am 0.5 of the way into refactoring for the 3rd time
 RicksMLC: *sigh*
 mlemm: take a deep breath it helps
 mlemm: im going to recode mine too the next morning
 Zenoscave: but not too many too fast
 Zenoscave: that's hyperventilating
 Astrobytes: Well, good luck to you all, I bid you goodnight.
 Zenoscave: Gn astro
 RicksMLC: g'night
 mlemm: goodnight Astro!
 mlemm: im leaving aswell best of luck guys.
 RicksMLC: Zeno: but but but, ... the sun just came up... again.
 Zenoscave: It's 16:16 here
 RicksMLC: Actually Zeno, I don't know how to play your code
 Zenoscave: wdym?
 RicksMLC: I am very new here (joined three days ago)
 RicksMLC: I think so... I have almost some idea of what I am doing here
 Zenoscave: use export mode under settings. it allows you to change your opponent
 mlemm: click delete button bellow the bot avatar
 RicksMLC: ok...
 mlemm: nvm he knows better
 RicksMLC: Ok I can select a new agent, but your name is not in the list?
 RicksMLC: I am in Bronze... so is that a limiting factor?
 RicksMLC: The list of agents only goes up to 999, and my current rank is 1,028
 RicksMLC: so... I dunno
 RicksMLC: Ugh I have so much dead/commented out code in here...
 RicksMLC: hard to move around
 JamieSims: very hard 
 JamieSims: what code language are you using 
 RicksMLC: c#
 TimurSeitosmanov: is there a way to measure time in js in submitted solution?
 SirLoxley: Rank 243/Bronze and I am out of ideas. Guess it's time to stop here
 Braykin08: Look at your losses, see why you lost, improve. Are you getting too few spells, crafting the wrong potions, getting beat to a potion
 LastRick: Seeing that -- getting beat to a potion -- a LOT more in silver
 Braykin08: Guess I'll need to improve my REST efficency once I reach that I guess
 ElderKamikaze: hey
 ToshiTuringMachine: hey
 ToshiTuringMachine: is really Response time for the first turn ≤ 1000ms&#160;? i get timeouts at 500
 ClockSort: I haven't pushed the limits of the first turn
 LastRick: yeah, I was going to say the same thing. I pretty much always LEARN on the first turn (so hard to find a brew with the starting spells) that I never run out of time
 ToshiTuringMachine: I guess it's dart language that has issues with datetime.now() . I am trying stopwatch now
 MarekM: ToshiTuringMachine i am safe at 800ms in python in first round
 ToshiTuringMachine: ty marekM
 Majeck: What do you use the first turn for?
 MarekM: and three seconds before first input&#160;:)
 ToshiTuringMachine: not very much, get together potions and learnable spells to guess the fastest brew-in
 MarekM: its not useful yet, but i try to precompute sth
 LastRick: I am using Dart. I use DateTime to track my BFS. But like I said, the BFS is nearly pointless on the first turn, I checked every possible combination in 3 ms.
 Recovery_disaster: Memo to me: pythons deepcopy is very slow ... wasted the last two days wonderung why I only get 500 BFS nodes in time -.-
 ToshiTuringMachine: nice lastrick! and how many sims can you do in one turn? 
 ToshiTuringMachine: I am hitting 22k
 Majeck: Do repeatable spells become exhausted after the turn?
 LastRick: I cap my search on time but yes over 10k
 Majeck: I know I can use them several times in the same turn, but after that do they become exhausted
 ToshiTuringMachine: yes they do majeck
 Majeck: Thanks
 Majeck: Redesigning my main recursive method to account for repeatable and castable lol
 Samer: Majeck I think you can use them once in a turn, but with a multiplier parameter (if your inventory can afford it)
 LastRick: That must be why you're beating me, majeck, using that repeatable
 Majeck: Not yet
 LastRick: me neither
 Majeck: If I had to guess I'd say I'm beating you because I explore more possibilities
 Majeck: around 60-70k with 45 ms
 Majeck: But the arena doesn't like me at the moment and got me from 730 -&gt; 890 with no changes to my bot lol
 LastRick: That's impressive!  Wow. 
 Majeck: In any case I'd like to be sub-600 so that I can safely get into gold
 Majeck: LastRick Yeahhh although it's a really simple recursive method
 LastRick: I know Dart's not the best for this but it's my language and I want to see how far I can push it
 Majeck: Don't even know what DFS/BFS is lol
 ToshiTuringMachine: google it, its interesting
 LastRick: Before codingame, I hadn't seen a BFS in I can't guess how long. But if you do a lot of the IN/OUT puzzles here, it becomes your best friend
 ToshiTuringMachine: lastrick me too! are you flutter dev?
 LastRick: Toshi: Yes
 MarekM: Anybody Monte Carlo algo?&#160;:) 
 LastRick: HAH
 ToshiTuringMachine: well don't fear me because i never win. and i already have the badge for language winner with dart
 LastRick: Wtg
 ToshiTuringMachine: if you don't c++ here it's very hard to get in legend
 LastRick: ugh. thanks for the warning.
 struct: There are more languages that will get legend im sure
 Blend-77: I'm tryna do it all in python for an extra challenge
 Recovery_disaster: C# and Rust is also strong
 Majeck: What's flutter dev?
 DreadY2K: Does the game show the number of potions a player has brewed so far?
 struct: C#, Rust, java, maybe python
 DreadY2K: I'd like to use that info, but I can't find it listed in the input
 Topjimmies: pretty easy to keep track
 DreadY2K: I could track it myself, but I want to be lazy 
 Majeck: DreadY2K no, but you can use score
 LastRick: my favorite is clash of code shortest. OMG  try to play that in Dart. You cant even read the input before Ruby has you beat.
 struct: Do if(currentScore&#160;!= previousScore) brewed++
 DreadY2K: Hmph, I guess I can track changes to score
 DreadY2K: I wanted to be lazy and read it in, but I guess this works
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah lastrick, dart is not fit for golf
 LastRick: Majeck: FLutter is googles multi-platform app/web development (Dart is the language it uses)
 ToshiTuringMachine: but js is pretty good and very similar to Dart
 Topjimmies: the final rule changes the time allowance to 5ms instead :joy:
 ToshiTuringMachine: final rule change? don't scare me
 Topjimmies: better get to work on that Neural network solution
 Majeck: No oh god
 LastRick: hah
 Majeck: I already feel so constricted with it being 50ms instead of 100
 LastRick: you have to pick one brew and hope you can snake a path there
 ToshiTuringMachine: we should be able to steal opponent's spells....
 Majeck: Or make spells have actions
 Topjimmies: you can only steal uncastable spells 
 LastRick: that OR I thought when we were still in wood and you could see the opponents cast, I thought we were going to be able to do things to their inventory
 Majeck: Imagine how cool a "Swap inventories with opponent" spell be
 LastRick: yeah, like tha
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah cool
 Majeck: Or Freeze Opponent for 3 turns
 Topjimmies: destroy target brew
 Arzugar: Or steal ingredients of something like that
 Majeck: Yeah
 Majeck: Would make it much more heuristic based
 Majeck: And a lot less sim based as is know
 LastRick: Not that I don't like this game (I certainly do) but yeah, some of these ideas would have added a different aspect. DO I just make brews (play offense) or do I attack my opponent?
 Majeck: I've gotta admit this contest is heavily penalized to if/elsers
 LastRick: Majeck: IF/ELSE Fan CLub President, apparently
 EnzoAbalos: hello
 Majeck: Like I don't even think you can get to silver without doing some sort of sim
 struct: well as a pro, the game is very simple to simulate
 Topjimmies: I got to silver with 2 turn sim
 Majeck: LastRick in all other contests I've been able to squeeze into Silver with just simple if/elses
 Majeck: Not this time though lol
 LastRick: i agree. I think to escape bronze I needed at least a few steps of search
 Majeck: Got a headache even thinking about how to choose a spell without simulating all possibilities
 Majeck: struct yeah, I'm jealous of you all using bitmaps and stuff
 ToshiTuringMachine: fitness function
 LastRick: learn about a bfs queue, it'll do that heavy lifting for you.
 struct: im not using bitmaps
 struct: and I get quite a good ammount of sims
 Topjimmies: I just see if you can brew after a cast and otherwise choose a random cast/learn
 Majeck: Do you use int arrays?
 struct: 1 int to store 4 igredients
 LastRick: Majeck: That is what your question back in bronze was about.
 LastRick: how to store all the ingredients as one
 struct: but before i was using 4 int8_t
 Majeck: I've been puzzling on how to use a single int instead of an array for days
 Majeck: Doing so would speed things up immensely if I could use binary operators
 Arzugar: And here I am, using python when you are trying to store 4 int in one to optimise your code
 Topjimmies: same
 Majeck: lol yep
 LastRick: I think i understand how to hold all four inventory spots in one number. What I can't picture yet is how to know if that one-number inventory is good enough to cast or brew
 struct: to subtract ingredients from another
 struct: i can just do int a - int b
 Majeck: I mean I figured out you could use 4 * 5 bits
 struct: instead of a[0] - b[0], a[1] - b[1] ...
 Majeck: struct YOU'RE A GENIUS
 struct: lol
 struct: im not
 struct: This was someone else idea in chat
 Majeck: Oh ok
 struct: And I think more people are using them
 Majeck: Wait
 Majeck: omg
 Majeck: I could totally do that
 Majeck: Just use 4 * 5 bits
 Majeck: And use the 5th bit to test for negatives
 Majeck: Will try to do some simpler stuff before though
 struct: well I use 7th bit
 Icebox: just hardcode every state Omegalul
 Majeck: Like acknowledging my opponent's existence lol
 struct: which is simpler
 LastRick: Are you going to try to sim them too?
 struct: and to check for negatives I just do an &amp;&amp;
 struct: &amp;
 Icebox: wait my mod icon is gone again
 Icebox: reee
 struct: again?
 LastRick: is that bad? or good?
 Icebox: yes
 LastRick: hah
 Arzugar: :joy:
 Icebox: yesterday they did some form of restart
 Icebox: which made it dissapear 
 Majeck: so 7*4 and you store them in a simple int32 struct
 struct: actually 8x4
 struct: Because the 7th is the "8" 
 Majeck: Ohhhh
 struct: I started counting from 0
 Majeck: lol
 Majeck: Oh and if it's invalid it'll just under/over flow to the next and you'll know something is wrong
 LastRick: did they decide they no longer needed you on the mod team?
 Majeck: That's genius!
 Icebox: LastRick no, it's a visual error
 LastRick: oh. I was hoping it involved something nefarious you had done
 mojojojo: does the price include the urgency bonus?
 Icebox: well yes, that too of course. I've been secretly hacking into their servers and stealing code from top players
 rwilson: mojojojo - yes
 mojojojo: okay
 Icebox: funny story regarding doing "something nefarious"
 Icebox: my first contact with the CG team
 Arzugar: Yes, story time&#160;!!!
 Icebox: was an email from them asking me whether I've been botting on clash
 LastRick: :astonished:
 Arzugar: and, you were&#160;?
 ScriptKiddie0101: i will hack you all :rage:
 Icebox: there was a huge problem with CoC
 LastRick: hahahah
 Icebox: where there were 3 or 5 guys
 Icebox: who made perfect CoC solvers
 ScriptKiddie0101: hack me if you can :rage:
 Icebox: and could submit in 1 sec every single clash
 ToshiTuringMachine: thats nefarius
 Icebox: at the same time I've been trying to reach rank 1 on CoC leaderboard
 LastRick: and pointless
 ToshiTuringMachine: put a random wait on it lol
 Icebox: and while i didn't "bot" I had my own clash database with solutions for every single clash in case of shortest
 LastRick: oh yeah, you're pretty high i see
 Icebox: and they noticed that very quickly :D
 Icebox: that was like 3 years ago
 LastRick: interesting
 LastRick: so they had picked up on the fact you were using repeat code or using code quickly, i guess?
 Icebox: no idea how they noticed it
 Arzugar: And, so, that database, how can I get my hands on it&#160;? Asking for a friend.
 Icebox: Arzugar the amount of clashse since then have probably quadrupled
 Icebox: clashes*
 Icebox: so it's useless now :D
 Arzugar: hoooo, so sad
 Icebox: but I have to say
 Icebox: I've been speaking at that time with some other bot devs
 struct: I remember seeing a website with all the solutions
 struct: for shortest
 struct: Was it yours?
 ToshiTuringMachine: disgusting
 Icebox: no, I never shared it struct
 Icebox: I actually apologized directly after the email for pasting solutions for some clashes and took a couple month break from CoC after that
 Icebox: then still got top 10 legitimately in 2019 :p
 Icebox: but man, decay sucked back then
 Icebox: now it's bearable
 LastRick: its different now?
 Icebox: yeah they changed it
 LastRick: slower i take it?
 struct: Back when I played CoC, I knew most of them  by hearth
 Icebox: yeah struct, that's legit the trick :D
 struct: It was disgusting
 Icebox: basically at some point they start repeating
 struct: I only saw first line of inputs and output and knew the answer
 Icebox: there were some clashes
 Icebox: that you could solve in 5 seconds legit
 struct: true
 Icebox: especially in shortest
 LastRick: Stop by the contribution page and check them out, they never stop coming.
 struct: while(N--)
 Icebox: or struct
 Icebox: 1 million question
 Icebox: DNA replace code
 Icebox: do you know the shortest code for that?
 Icebox: :D
 struct: What was it like the question?
 Scorpio69t: hello,world
 struct: hi
 Icebox: atp to adp or something like that
 Icebox: there was an 8 char solution in bash
 struct: There were some crazy bash solutions
 struct: that I memorized at the time
 struct: Just to solve the problems
 Icebox: there was also a famous one
 Icebox: print&lt;*64&gt;
 struct: `seq 1 2` or whatever it was
 struct: Something like that
 struct: `dd` ...
 NoobCod3: guys I'm coding with my mechanical keyboard and my hacker mask LOL in the Clash Of Code
 struct: something
 struct: But I learned a few dirty tricks from CoC
 NoobCod3: and i have 2 computers
 Icebox: oh sorry I meant
 NoobCod3: but the other one isn't charged
 Icebox: DNA to RNA
 Icebox: that was the task
 Arzugar: I mean, now, if you really wanted to, you can maybe do a bot who would play and lose his firsts games and steal others players solution, and by playing multiple games at the same time, maybe it would be possible to know them all.
 Icebox: the code was `tr a u` or something like that
 Icebox: :D
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, CoC is good for picking up dirty tricks that would generally be frowned upon.
 Icebox: AbundantPuddle tbh I found a very good use for CoC
 NoobCod3: could anybody teach me how to code in Python 3?
 Icebox: and it's to get comfy with a new language
 Icebox: if you can win all fastest clashes with a language you're pretty much good to go
 Icebox: without switching
 Icebox: it made me learn like half of C++ standard library
 Icebox: once I tried playing CoC with C++ only
 struct: you learned c++ on CoC?
 NoobCod3: I NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP ME CODE
 NoobCod3: IN PYTHON 3
 NoobCod3: PLZ
 Icebox: I wouldn't call it learning
 NoobCod3: srry caps
 LastRick: I completed the entire Clash tree on the home page with Dart. I consider that my crowning achievement on this site.
 AbundantPuddle: Oh yeah, I mean I actually really like CoC. But there have been quite a few times where I won and genuinely felt bad because others were following good practice. That being said, I also have viewed others' code and discovered some nifty little tricks myself.
 ToshiTuringMachine: wow gg LastRick
 Icebox: I trained my skills that I learned using CoC struct
 ToshiTuringMachine: I never completed that
 AbundantPuddle: I wish everyone just shared their code by default however, because there have been some matches where I was dumbfounded by the #1 spot, and couldn't view their code.
 LastRick: The toughest part is definitely winning 3 in a row.
 LastRick: yeah, people dont want to share because they're probably trying to get to the top. I often dont share because i know no one wants it&#160;:)
 Icebox: struct, especially if you're not learning your first language and you restrict yourself to it, you might have a feeling how you'd do it in a language that you're familiar with... then you think is there a similar function in that language as well? Makes you learn the in-built functions
 ToshiTuringMachine: you cannot force people to share
 Icebox: tbh CoC is the sole reason I could probably list all in-built functions of Python in a beat :D
 Icebox: also you learn to read code from other languages 
 Icebox: maybe with exception of bash and perl :D
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, if I don't complete the challenge in time, I won't share. Otherwise I'll share. At the very least, people could use it to see how not to code. xp
 LastRick: hah
 Majeck: I always share except for shortest
 Majeck: I used to play CoC for years only in C#
 Icebox: shortest is the only type where it matters :D
 LastRick: makes sense in a way
 struct: I share it even if I use ruby and bash in the same language
 Majeck: The amount of tricks for golfing in C# that I learned are insane
 Icebox: true
 struct: `tail -1`
 Icebox: you get to learn the language in a completely different way
 struct: p`dd`[2..].stuff
 ClockSort: what's the best language for CoC golfing?
 struct: bash perl ruby python javascript
 struct: on that order maybe
 struct: javascript is not great though
 Majeck: Once I discovered the golfing competitive puzzles a few weeks ago I'm like top 20% in all of them thanks to C# lol
 LastRick: of the top 3 you listed, ruby is probably the one i see the most in coc
 Icebox: +1 struct
 Majeck: Love ya C#
 Icebox: LastRick you would never with with ruby against someone who is skilled with bash or perl
 Icebox: it's just not that many people
 Icebox: who can do that
 LastRick: exactly
 Majeck: I think bash doesn't even let you multiply
 Majeck: it's crazy
 LastRick: WHAT!?
 Icebox: and even then
 Icebox: as much as I learned
 Icebox: about golfing
 Icebox: and python
 Icebox: there are people who are on a completely different level
 struct: ^
 Icebox: for example
 Icebox: Thor
 Icebox: right now (after the update)
 Icebox: I have a 74 char submission
 Majeck: No wait, I think I was thinking of another language not sure
 Icebox: which puts me at top #5 in python
 Icebox: first place has 51 chars
 Icebox: which is
 Icebox: like
 struct: Nice I have one char less than you on temps with perl IceBox
 phord: echo $(( 6 * 7)) 42
 Icebox: struct I never worked on temps
 Icebox: never worked implies never tried reverse engineering test cases that is&#160;:^)
 struct: Never did that too
 struct: to much work
 Icebox: yeah but that's the only way
 struct: 47-perl, 48-ruby
 struct: with legit solutions
 struct: legit if you count running bash on ruby
 Icebox: huh
 Icebox: holdup
 struct: :D
 Icebox: lol
 Icebox: I looked up my pash solution
 Icebox: bash
 Icebox: perl -e'...
 Icebox: oops
 Icebox: :D
 ToshiTuringMachine: guys why you like golf? it makes you learn how to reduce chars... totally useless in real jobs
 DreadY2K: It's a fun challenge, even if it isn't directly useful
 struct: its for fun
 ToshiTuringMachine: and golfed solutions are usually awful
 Icebox: ToshiTuringMachine why do you learn chess? it's uselss in real jobs as well
 struct: I dont do everything to get jobs
 ZarthaxX: you do it to get chicks
 rwilson: Though, golfing also makes you understand your languages better -  usually to understand WEIRD issues and spot things to avoid
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi ZarthaxX
 Icebox: brings your pickup lines to a whole different level
 ToshiTuringMachine: find me a girl who understand code golf i will marry her
 Icebox: when you put everything on the same line to save chars
 Icebox: kappa
 ZarthaxX: HI ToshiTuringMachine
 Icebox: another fun story
 Icebox: there are other websites 
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah... story time
 Icebox: that have golf 
 Icebox: the difference in some however
 Icebox: is they don't count whitespaces and newlines
 Icebox: so that you don't have to completely fuck your code up
 Icebox: so big brain me, just made a string full of whitespates representing 0 and newlines representing 1 and encoded full solution in binary
 struct: also some count bytes 
 struct: lol Icebox
 Icebox: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 ToshiTuringMachine: wooow icebox. pretty cheater
 Icebox: another fun solution for some tasks is resubmitting code
 Icebox: that outputs valid but random solutions
 Icebox: err actions
 Icebox: that could be potentially shorter than solving the task
 struct: so you submit until you get lucky?
 Icebox: and one in maybe a couple of hundred will pass all test cases
 Icebox: yes
 Icebox: I know there are people who have done it on thor
 Icebox: there are only 4 validators
 LastRick: about to say that, i think thats how to pass thor here
 Icebox: so it takes like 300 submits 
 Icebox: which isn't that much
 Icebox: LastRick the thing is, remember me saying the 51char solution is insane?
 Icebox: python doesn't support randomness without importing it
 LastRick: yep
 Icebox: so importing alone is pretty much as long as the solution :D
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7e50407-f144-4ae2-9607-a761609d7a98">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7e50407-f144-4ae2-9607-a761609d7a98</a>
 Icebox: that alone is like 40 chars
 Icebox: and that's without print()
 Icebox: dude I'd sell my newborn to find out how he did it&#160;:/
 Icebox: ok maybe not that
 Icebox: but still
 Icebox: ANOTHER FUN STORY
 Icebox: I remember talking with a buddy like a month ago
 Icebox: how thor could be solved
 Icebox: with like this insane amout of chras
 Icebox: chars*
 struct: I never figured how to reduce thor code
 Icebox: and we legit considered using LRZ which is munichs largest computer center with supercomputers etc. to bruteforce every legal code that compiles under 52 chars
 Icebox: maybe write a scientific paper about so that my uni lets me do that
 Icebox: but hey
 ToshiTuringMachine: i think they should erase all solutions and add some validators so the random-cheaters would not win
 Icebox: ToshiTuringMachine ok you're about to be really dissapointed by this
 Icebox: but that would legit
 Icebox: break everyone's code
 Icebox: not only random guys
 Icebox: since top guys have reverse engineered all validators we legit don't read input fully
 ToshiTuringMachine: they just resubmit
 Icebox: nonono
 Icebox: you don't get it
 Icebox: the top solutions are specifically for the 4 validators
 Icebox: one example for thor is
 struct: My code doesnt even go north
 Icebox: yeah
 Icebox: for example that
 Icebox: except it's west
 Icebox: err east I mean
 Icebox: no, west
 struct: isnt it north?
 Arzugar: South&#160;?
 Icebox: nope
 Icebox: 2nd validator is north
 Westicles: Golf could be easily fixed by adding a bunch of validators and making the paths to all the system calls 100 characters
 ToshiTuringMachine: who cares? if the problem is hardcodable, it is not a problem and there's an issue with it
 Icebox: how is that an issue?
 Icebox: I don't understand what's the problem with creative solutions
 struct: Golfing is not to be taken seriously
 ToshiTuringMachine: the programmer must solve problems for all inputs (in real life) not for 4 validators
 struct: Its for fun
 Icebox: ToshiTuringMachine this isn't real life
 Icebox: why do you keep comparing a game with real life
 struct: Soon we need to check if the input is valid
 struct: and does not break our code
 Icebox: struct wdym?
 struct: In real life we need to be carefull about what the user will do
 Icebox: oh yeah
 Icebox: I mean I don't get the whole idea of comparing a for fun activity with job environment :D
 Icebox: but sure
 struct: golf was never meant for it
 Icebox: yup
 struct: Doesnt matter if its 4 or 1000 validators
 struct: Top code will always be a mess
 Icebox: I'm not sure if I remember correctly
 Icebox: but either on CG or some other website
 Icebox: the top code was a call to a server
 Icebox: which would return solution
 Icebox: until the website dissalowed calls 
 Icebox: to external websites
 Westicles: That was CG
 ToshiTuringMachine: so since its a game its correct to hardcode solutions? CG rules state clearly that you can be banned
 struct: I think it worked on cG
 Icebox: yeah
 Icebox: ToshiTuringMachine what?
 Icebox: banned for what?
 Icebox: I would love to see that rule
 Icebox: can you link me the source from where you got this?
 Westicles: The official position is anything goes.  It is in a forum post
 Icebox: yeah I'm quite concerned with the pure missinformation coming from you ToshiTuringMachine
 Icebox: you can NOT get banned for hardcoding anything
 Icebox: in no way or form does that hurt anyone
 struct: Everyone can do it
 struct: is fair game
 ToshiTuringMachine: By participating in a CodinGame Contest, all Participants shall refrain from cheating, faking, thieving identity or any other technique to change the result of the Contest.&#160;
 Icebox: a) those are not contests
 ToshiTuringMachine: "misinformation"
 Icebox: b) hardcoding isn't listed
 struct: lol
 Icebox: yes, you're spreading missinformation, the fact that you can get banned is a blatant lie
 Majeck: Yeah hardcoding is allowed for code golf
 sadakatsu: Hardcoding is not the same thing as using a solution you found somewhere else.
 ToshiTuringMachine: for me it still is cheating. if you get fun cheating you are not a programmer, just a hacker who destroy other people self esteem with your tricks. 
 ToshiTuringMachine: but hey, your style of fun. do whatever
 sadakatsu: Funny, the lead programmer at Big Huge Games once said that actual programmers cheat all the time, including on academic tests and projects.  I strongly disagreed, but the severe difference in those opinions amuses me.
 Skynse: Imagine cheating
 Icebox: "Cheating generally describes various actions designed to subvert rules in order to obtain _unfair advantages_." Since we already made clear that it's perfectly fine to hardcode, how is that an "unfair" advantage?
 Icebox: definition taken from wiki
 Icebox: there is no rule against hardcoding
 JamesOConnor: You are right
 Majeck: I mean I don't like hardcoding nor am I in favour of it
 Majeck: But if it works it works
 ScriptKiddie0101: what is hardcoding?
 struct: I dont get why people are taking code golf seriously
 struct: I even hardcoded CvZ
 sadakatsu: `int random_integer() { return 4; }`
 Majeck: if(input == "a") print("b") else if (input == "b") print("c")
 struct: Its stuff that no one cares about
 Icebox: ScriptKiddie0101 instead of writing the code that solves the problem you wrote code that solves the specific cases that test your program
 Majeck: Yes
 Rodrigo_the_coder: print("Help me")
 sadakatsu: Technically, hardcoding is an important part of TDD.  You WANT to hardcode until you can actually produce a test that breaks any possible hardcoded solutions.
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8db050e3-68b9-4a9d-b427-425d8a00a4f6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8db050e3-68b9-4a9d-b427-425d8a00a4f6</a>
 Icebox: imagine if I were to test you if you know what is 9x9 and 2x5. You could learn how to multiply or you could learn the answers to those two questions
 struct: That is from CvZ
 rwilson: can we let world chat go back to contest talk &amp; shenanigans?CG says 'MEH'  about hardcoding&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/rules-of-the-code-golf-and-optimization-challenges/187258/5">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/rules-of-the-code-golf-and-optimization-challenges/187258/5</a> 
 struct: Its 500 lines of that
 struct: I have 454 prints
 struct: for 21 validatosr
 Rodrigo_the_coder: any idea for cvz in python
 Icebox: struct, correct me if I'm wrong but 2048 can be _fully_ hardcoded, right?
 struct: too many validators
 Icebox: is it tho?
 struct: yes
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: I guess you can't reach 4Mln
 DomiKo: with full hardcode
 Icebox: hmm
 struct: I think somone said 7
 struct: on discord
 DomiKo: sorry
 DomiKo: 14 mln
 DomiKo: not 4
 Icebox: interesting 
 Icebox: haven't tried 2048 yet
 Icebox: but I thought about whether it would be possible (file size wise)
 NoobCod3: guys
 NoobCod3: I'm on my second computer
 NoobCod3: I'm on both of them
 NoobCod3: LOL
 struct: oh well, it was fun
 struct: Im going to sleep now
 struct: gn
 Icebox: :wave:
 Icebox: gn
 DomiKo: gn
 Majeck: I hate how "Fixing" my code just plunges me further down the leaderboard lol
 NoobCod3: OOF
 NoobCod3: guys join CLASH OF CODE
 NoobCod3: plz
 RicksMLC: "Software development is an evolutionary process - sometimes a meteor is involved."
 NoobCod3: l need someone to help me learn Python
 LastRick: Majeck I try something that I think will surely make it better ---&gt; drop to bottom
 Majeck: I know right!
 Icebox: NoobCod3 that's quite the bad timing since everyone is working on the contest
 Icebox: you do have enough materials online to learn everything by yourself
 NoobCod3: BAD TIMING?
 NoobCod3: AND WHAT CONTESt?
 Icebox: correct
 LastRick: I'll admit it, I just can't incorporate REST into the middle of a search. It looks like others are doing it, but every time I try to implement it, SPLAT
 NoobCod3: the fall?
 Icebox: Fall Challenge
 Icebox: yes
 NoobCod3: @Icebox can you help me learn Python 3?
 NoobCod3: I am noob
 Icebox: yes I can
 NoobCod3: like right now
 Icebox: step 1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/">https://docs.python.org/3/</a>
 Icebox: read this through
 NoobCod3: hold on
 Majeck: Hahahhahaahahha
 Majeck: =D
 Icebox: then you can ask me if you have any questions
 NoobCod3: ok im gonna read it rn
 NoobCod3: tutorial?
 Icebox: yeah you can start from there
 NoobCod3: ok
 Mr_Robooot: are there any  high ranked people in the silver league with only 'if else' statements?
 Majeck: No
 Icebox: depends what you mean with high ranked
 Majeck: Everyone's doing sims as far as I know
 MadAsAJazzer: ah yes, those things I definitely know how to use *furious googling ensues*
 Majeck: simulations
 Mr_Robooot:&#160;:( well i guess i should rewrite my code all over again now
 MadAsAJazzer: oof&#160;:/
 LastRick: i would think it would be nearly impossible to pass silver without a BFS or similarly search. You have to figure out how to get to the big prizes even when they are many steps away
 Majeck: Exactly!
 Icebox: disagree 
 LastRick: i'm listening
 Icebox: functional programming can get you to legend here
 Icebox: if you see all spells as mathematical operations you can "solve for" the spells that you need to cast
 LastRick: oh i thought you were disagreeing about needing to when the big prizes
 jrke: in this contest you can many things simulation,GA,BFS,etc
 LastRick: i agree, just pick the tool you feel comfortable with
 Icebox: I disagree about search
 Icebox: I think math gets here far
 LastRick: sorry for the confusion then
 phord: 4-dimensional math with small domains.
 LastRick: i just mean you can't win by trying to be the first to six
 ndosm: sorry what does GA stand for?
 Icebox: Genetic Algorithm
 ndosm: thank you
 jrke: Genetic algorithm
 Icebox: precisely phord
 Icebox: imo if you implement that cleanly that could potentially be stronger than simulating the game
 jrke: Boxy you were first at one moment right?
 MoMaT: NoobCod3, f you know some other programming language and trying to pickup Python, see this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html">http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html</a> 
 Icebox: yes jrke
 Icebox: I'm not submitting my code rn tho
 Icebox: I'll wait until legend opens
 jrke: cool
 jrke: i am also thinking to don't make submit until my bot in ide is 100% better than bot in arena
 Icebox: as long as you're high enough to get promoted when new league comes out there is no reason whatsoever to submit
 Icebox: top players tend to hide their codes till the last minute
 Icebox: and just play millions of games offline with brutaltester
 Icebox: to see if they are improving
 LastRick: How silly
 Icebox: quite smart tbh, if you're winning against everyone it's hard to improve your code
 Icebox: if someone who has a better bot doesn't submit you can not find out WHY that bot is better
 LastRick: its a game. Miss out on all the fun of this because you want to win? That's outrageous.
 hbouillo: But on the same logic, you can't find out if others' bots are better than yours, can you?
 Icebox: hbouillo that's what brutaltester is for
 Icebox: also you can still play against others in the website without submitting
 hbouillo: Does it allow you to play other people's bots?
 Icebox: yes
 hbouillo: LastRick it's a game, yes, but a competitive one&#160;:)
 NoobCod3: =
 LastRick: apparently
 hbouillo: Also, Icebox, I don't know the details of GA, but from what I know it can't be better than a simulation, if the simulation is properly accurate, can it?
 Icebox: oh you use both
 Icebox: GA is just an algorithm to process the data from your simulation
 hbouillo: What can GA add that simulation doesn't?
 Icebox: simulation alone can nothing
 Icebox: simulation just gives you data to work with
 Icebox: simulation is not an algorithm
 sadakatsu: Evaluating a GA solution requires simulation, anyway  ^_^;
 hbouillo: ^^^
 Icebox: precisely
 Poli2312: Hi
 Poli2312: Im new i started coding today
 Icebox: whether you process the information that you get from simulating the game using GA or something else is up to you
 dreadylein: good luck and have fun
 Poli2312: It look easy
 hbouillo: Isn't GA basically simulating in a controlled-random way?
 Poli2312: wait someone won
 dreadylein: huh&#160;? 
 dreadylein: well simulation is a part of ga if thats the question&#160;:)
 Icebox: I think you're missunderstanding what simulation and what GA do
 dreadylein: simulation or otherwise evaluting the fitness
 hbouillo: I'm confused about GA, I'll need to do more research on it haha
 Icebox: simulating does nothing else besides showing you what action leads to what state
 Icebox: now how do you decide which actions do you wanna simulate?
 Icebox: that's where GA comes into play
 dreadylein: ga basicly mimics evolution, you create a opulation of solution , then add random changes, and cross them, check which has the highest fitness, rinse repeate
 dreadylein: *population
 hbouillo: Oh, I see the technical difference you put between GA and simulation
 Icebox: you could use GA to generate populations of actions that will progressively get better, you  could use monte carlo tree search to find a very good path that leads you to victory, you could use BFS to test ALL actions or you could use something completely different
 hbouillo: And now I do agree that a GA algorithm could own the contest :thumbsup:
 dreadylein: i doubt it :P
 Icebox: in the end all of those algorithms just tell the sim what to check
 Icebox: what to simulate
 dreadylein: ga is a neat class, but nearly always there is something thats better suited
 hbouillo: I doubht it'd be fast enough though
 jrke: hbouillo you need good eval for that
 jrke: and optimized code
 Icebox: ^
 Icebox: how many states can you simulate in 50 ms?
 dreadylein: optimized code doesent help if you have a bad evalution ... i heard from soneone :P :D
 hbouillo: Yeah the eval function is a critical point :D
 dreadylein: iam terrible when it comes to crafting heuristics
 jrke: i am getting avg 15k iterations for simulation per turn in 50ms depth5
 dreadylein: and choose a algo that needs a REALY good one :D like a boss ^^
 kreska: i have a question are you guys frustrated when you debug soething for 5 hours because i have problem coping emotionally:D Right now im happy because i finally found the bugs but i was raging inside and outside
 Icebox: welcome to the club kreska
 dreadylein: no worries it gets better .. after a decade or two, then you realize you can anoy other people with it also&#160;!&#160;:)
 hbouillo: kreska usually "raging" out loud is what leads me to find the bug haha
 Xenoid: I think GA is better for continuous games, not discrete ones
 dreadylein: true
 sadakatsu: It's a lousy club, since WE'RE members, but welcome anyways.
 Xenoid: being off by one ingredient from the potion you need is not particularly close to being as good as being on target
 kreska: but i swear a lot this is my problem
 sadakatsu: Same here.  Any solutions?
 Xenoid: so mutations are just going to destroy anything good about an existing solution
 dreadylein: cant remember if there was a contest were ga was optimal
 Icebox: CSB
 Icebox:&#160;:)
 dreadylein: no
 dreadylein: people won with it
 Xenoid: GA is good for physics-based games, I think
 dreadylein: its far from optimal
 jrke: CSB is evergreen
 hbouillo: Well GA is probably the slowest way to solve any of the contests
 Xenoid: vector math is probably better
 jrke: you can use anything in CSB
 Icebox: you can use NN in CSB
 dreadylein: true and then get butchered by nns :P
 dreadylein: csb was cool
 dreadylein: afaik the top went
 dreadylein: ga after contest
 dreadylein: later minmax
 dreadylein: then nns
 hbouillo: nns?
 Icebox: Neural Network
 motty: kreska: this is the shape of things. been debugging my own crappy code for... more decades than I want to admit to... it never ends, it's just how it is. first you write the code, then you debug it.
 hbouillo: Why the S
 Icebox: Neural NetworkS
 dreadylein: neural networks that were trained with reeinforment
 hbouillo: haha
 Batpapa: 15k simulations in 50ms? I can barely make 3k..&#160;:'(
 dreadylein: huh .. 
 Batpapa: I can even remember fighting someone doing up to 30k
 LLG: what's the tomeIndex of learned spells?
 jrke: none it comes in you cast spell then LLG
 Icebox: -1
 LLG: thanks for the help!!
 Batpapa: 0 = bottom spell, ..., 5 = top
 Icebox: for learned spells Batpapa
 Icebox: for learned ones it's -1
 Batpapa: sorry
 Batpapa: surer
 Batpapa: sure
 Batpapa: Are you all here going for MCTS?
 dreadylein: iam not
 NoobCod3: hey guys wanna be friends or no?
 NoobCod3: cause l want friends
 motty: we're all friends here, NoobCod3&#160;:)
 Batpapa: dreadylein ok, what then? Just to have a clue on what people try&#160;:)
 dreadylein: beamsearch
 Batpapa: ok thx, finally it's all about heuristics, so always :p
 Batpapa: *as
 hbouillo: What's MCTS?
 LLG: when you learn a spell, do you pay the tax first or get the taxed ingredients on that spell first?
 LLG: I'm assuming paying first, right?
 Xenoid: pay first
 MoMaT: MCTS is another semi-random search algorithm, like GA.
 nemo_001: LCA
 MoMaT: but it has some memory, and is particularly good in min-max style games.
 LLG: sounds interesting
 dreadylein: mcts will converege to minmax given infinte time
 hbouillo: Oh, I see
 hbouillo: What does MCTS stand for?
 Icebox: Monte Carlo Tree Search
 LLG: Monte Carlo Tree Search, I assume
 hbouillo: Ah, yes, heard about that one!
 LLG: glanced over it yesterday while doing research, but didn't read into it much
 MoMaT: in general, what you hear people calling "sim" here in chat, is really search + evaluation.
 Icebox: ^
 MoMaT: search generates the moves, and evaluation function helps you pick the best one.
 hbouillo: Yes, that is why I was confused earlier when Icebox was explaining&#160;:)
 MoMaT: often you would do both at the same time, incrementally adding next move and evaluating the result.
 LLG: what are some easier-to-get-into search algorithms I could try? atm I'm just writing the base game logic (generating a new state after executing an action)
 MoMaT: so it feels like you play the game forward into the future,
 LLG: haven't gotten into the heuristics side of things
 MoMaT: like you are simulating it.
 MoMaT: the easiest is random search&#160;:)
 MoMaT: you generate moves at random, and pick the best one based on some score.
 MoMaT: it's obviously not the best, although people in the optimisation field argue till this day if you can really do better (No Free Lunch theorem)&#160;:)
 LLG: I'm thinking about generating all the states up to a certain depth
 LLG: then apply some sort of pruning somehow
 MoMaT: if you want something smarter, I guess next is hill climbing, where you only generate improving moves.
 LLG: idk how time efficient that would be though
 MoMaT: if you generate all the states that's exhaustive search, also know as brute force.
 LLG: also, since this is a simultaneous move game, I should generate my opponent's move at the same time, no?
 hbouillo: That likely won't get you far in 50ms
 hbouillo: (Talking about the bruteforce way)
 LLG: like, the process of generating a new state involves executing my move, and my opponent's
 MoMaT: no, you can ignore the opponent until you start loosing games because of that.
 kreska: omg fun thing happen i just test my newest version of my bot and i found a guy that has identically thae same strategy lern the same spells cast exactly the same thing with exception of not using repeatability of the spell:D
 MoMaT: in silver I doubt you need to worry about it as long as your won play is good.
 MoMaT: in this game opponents play does not interfere with the state so much.
 MoMaT: you both can take the same spell or deliver the same potion.
 MoMaT: it's more a matter of targeting. you don't want to chase things you know your opponent will get first.
 MoMaT: but I might be wrong, we see later in the contest if there is some nuance there.
 kreska: or maybe he sohow mimicks the oponent strategy? but he didnt use repeats. i need to think about it:D
 pde-bakk: yeah the Sims 4 is a great game
 MoMaT: I predict all the best bots will play in a very similar way. almost mirroring each other like kreska was describing.
 sadakatsu: I think there will be more variety than that.  The evaluation functions will make themselves known.
 Icebox: MoMaT it's more about when the first different action happens
 Icebox: if it happens early the rest of the game will be completely different
 MoMaT: yes, that's true. order of delivery still matters.
 MoMaT: but I expect that by the end of contest this would be figured out. best bots will go for the same trade-offs. we'll see&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: how much memory does codingame give you again?
 Xenoid: 768MB
 NinjaDoggy: so you can have up to 2 X 10^8 ints?
 NinjaDoggy: 768 * 1024 * 1024 / 4&#160;?
 Icebox: bonk
 Icebox: no hardcoding
 Icebox: no precomputing
 Icebox: bad NinjaDoggy
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 NinjaDoggy: nah was just wondering if I can create a decently large number of nodes
 NinjaDoggy: or if I had to memory optimize my node attributes
 Icebox: don't you need just 1001&#160;:^)
 NinjaDoggy: ahh of course&#160;;)
 Xenoid: A decently large number of precomputed nodes, you mean?
 NinjaDoggy: nah not precomputed
 NinjaDoggy: just pre memory allocated
 Icebox: that's literally what precomputing means :D
 NinjaDoggy: I guess...
 NinjaDoggy: but I usually think of precomputing as doing something more intelligent
 NinjaDoggy: than just being dummies there :P
 MoMaT: preallocating&#160;!= precomputing
 Icebox: you need to precompute everything that you're preallocating
 NinjaDoggy: ^
 LLG: what are some ideas to implement state evaluation?I'm thinking about factoring in current score and some sort of distance from recipes
 NinjaDoggy: yea i'm precomputing them to zero though lol
 Icebox: :D
 NinjaDoggy: @LLG honestly I would give some ideas if I had any
 NinjaDoggy: but I literally just use score + inventory * constant
 NinjaDoggy: tier-0 = 1, tier 1=2, tier2=3,tier3=4
 LLG: I'm thinking
 LLG: since different recipes have different payout
 NinjaDoggy: and then let the search handle everything else&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: yea there's a formula to that
 LLG: maybe the recipe price can act as a coefficient
 NinjaDoggy: recipe price = cost of parts
 NinjaDoggy: +1 if there's 3 different elements
 NinjaDoggy: and +2 if there's 4 different elemtns
 LLG: there is? I wasn't aware of that
 NinjaDoggy: it's not explicitly told
 NinjaDoggy: but people figured it out
 LLG: so there isn't really much merit to taking the recipe price into account, right?
 LLG: since factoring in your inventory state does basically the same thing
 MoMaT: it's the same pretty much in every game LLG. state after move should be close to target (point giving) state.
 MoMaT: for example, so you can measure the distance between your inventory and the orders.
 NinjaDoggy: well... recipe price matters too
 NinjaDoggy: for a few reasons:
 MoMaT: it could be just difference and items, but that's approximation. the best would be a number of moves to reach it.
 NinjaDoggy: 1:recipes with variety do give a slight +1 or +2 bonux
 NinjaDoggy: 2:there's a +3,+1 bonus for recipes at the start
 NinjaDoggy: and then the main reason is to cash out and make space to generate more stuff
 Xenoid: ouch
 Xenoid: I won 26 of the first 28 this submission
 Xenoid: and then lost 10 in a row
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: resubmit time?
 hbouillo: Xenoid Rude haha
 MoMaT: then you need to consider the radeoff between the distance and the reward, and decide to make more moves to get higher price.
 jrke: Xenoid happens a lot
 NinjaDoggy: idk if 10 in a row happens a lot lol...
 MoMaT: ...or take the first "quick" order, e.g. because you're already ahead.
 phord: The bonus is added in to the recipe price, too, so you can ignore the bonus unless you're counting the chance of getting it first.
 LLG: &gt; the bonus is added in to the recipe price
 LLG: does it mean if a recipe is 17 + 3
 LLG: recipe.price is 20?
 LLG: and recipe.tomeIndex is 3
 Zenoscave: yes
 LLG: I see
 NinjaDoggy: ok if i'm ranked 56 rn is there a point to submitting?
 NinjaDoggy: like do I just wait for gold tomorrow then submit?
 Icebox: not really
 Icebox: wait till gold
 Zenoscave: gold is tomorrow!?
 NinjaDoggy: yea
 Icebox: yea
 hbouillo: Yes
 Zenoscave: I'm losing track
 jrke: gold is today i think
 NinjaDoggy: yea depends on time zone i guess
 NinjaDoggy: it's in 12 hours?
 Xenoid: Gold is in 13.5 hrs, yeah
 Icebox: yeah
 jrke: oh lol
 jrke: i think top 280-290 will be promoted to gold automatically
 kreska: man time flies
 phord: Is there a disadvantage to submitting again?  Can you lose position you would otherwise keep?
 Whiskee: can you be demoted after that? asking for a friend, of course
 NinjaDoggy: @phord yes
 phord:&#160;:-O
 NinjaDoggy: your bot usually will sit higher
 NinjaDoggy: than initial submit
 NinjaDoggy: due to the types of opponents you play
 ZarthaxX: Whiskee nope
 NinjaDoggy: since bots are rock, paper, scissors(in most games) to some degree
 NinjaDoggy: you can lose against bots with lower rating
 Icebox: ZarthaxX with how you code we might add demotion just for you
 Icebox:&#160;:^)
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 NinjaDoggy: also hai ZarthaxX :D
 ZarthaxX: Icebox sure bro, same goes for you and your c++ performance
 ZarthaxX: hai NinjaDogo
 NinjaDoggy: on the topic of C++ performance...
 NinjaDoggy: icebox C++ rewrite when?
 ZarthaxX: he is on it
 Icebox: it's actually long done
 ZarthaxX: failing hard tho
 Icebox: :D
 NinjaDoggy: :joy:
 ZarthaxX: might have to ask CG stuff to give him extra initial time
 ZarthaxX: or maybe a bit more ms each turn, tocompensate
 NinjaDoggy: :rofl:
 Icebox: those are some harsh statements
 Icebox: coming from someone so deep down in silver
 Icebox:&#160;:^)
 ZarthaxX: i dont have time to play this thing lmao
 ZarthaxX: you are the one that doesnt sleep
 Icebox: I'm sure you don't&#160;:^)
 Icebox: that's something I would say as well if I couldn't get out of silver :wink:
 ZarthaxX: i cant get out of silver, as there is no other league
 ZarthaxX: you should go to sleep ice, already allucinating
 jrke: ZarthaxX  gold will open in 13 hours from now 
 Icebox: :D
 Icebox: the more you know ZarthaxX
 NinjaDoggy: are there any top bots remaining that still hardcode X turns of learn and then never learn again?
 hbouillo: I believe emil does it
 hbouillo: 6 turns if I remember well
 ZarthaxX: my point is, there no other league rn
 ZarthaxX: i can't get out of silver coz of that 
 NinjaDoggy: Psyho still does 8 huh
 ZarthaxX: lol wat
 NinjaDoggy: learn 8 turns at the beginning, and then cast/brew only
 kreska: My new bot is 338 is it enough for gold? At this point i just want to be gold :D
 NinjaDoggy: only tomorrow will tell
 NinjaDoggy: in general, it's much easier to promote when a new league just openms
 kreska: can you get depromoted back?
 NinjaDoggy: no
 kreska: thats good to hear :D
 jrke: kreska  i think gold will open nearby 290 somewhere so you can make gold
 DreadY2K: My bot just learns a new spell whenever the opponent knows more spells than I doIt does poorly, but that's for other reasons
 DreadY2K: It balances learning new things pretty well
 kreska: jrke i hope so im so addicted to this game :D
 Xenoid: Wow, let's find the median by doing A[A.size()] / 2. That will work
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: happens

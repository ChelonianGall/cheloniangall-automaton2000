 Thorcode: how can I replace every same character in CG?
 TheBlueBias: There's no identical character in CG
 Thorcode: I saw a guy do that
 TheBlueBias: 'C' and 'G' are different characters...
 Uljahn: you mean he used magic or some undocumented features?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: like I have c in everyline of my code then he can change every c to b
 Thorcode: and CG is codingame
 TheBlueBias: There's no identical chars in codingame either...
 Thorcode: like I have two line of "c" and I want to change it to b
 Thorcode: to two line of b
 TheBlueBias: ctrl+f
 Uljahn: crtl+h
 Thorcode: thanks alot
 Thorcode: I was trying to shorten my code in codegolf

 ESMAKING: yes @mrmnrd because no one likes me now but if i get hired at google everyone likes me cus google awesome
 mrmnrd: just be nice with people, i belive they'll like you. Google is awesome, but not so nice anymore

 Wontonimo: let me know if you'd like some help getting started
 TimothyAlexisVass: a = [1,2,3,4,3,4,3,4]a.index(3) = 2Is it possible to get index of the last occurence instead?
 whatevericando4you: a.index[3] would be 4
 CHRONORMU: hello world 
 ChutOuLeTcheTche: g
 ChutOuLeTcheTche: g
 ChutOuLeTcheTche: g
 Wontonimo: if you want the last item TimothyAlexisVass you can use
 Wontonimo: a[-1]
 Wontonimo: if you want to know the number of elements 
 Wontonimo: len(a)
 Wontonimo: the last element is therefore
 Wontonimo: len(a) -1
 Wontonimo: if you want to iterate over all a and also want an index you can do
 Wontonimo: for index,value in enumerate(a):
 pihack: @Exyos33
 pihack: Exyos33 
 ChutOuLeTcheTche: actually, Timothy, if you want to take the substract of the blyat, you have to multiply the variable by the power of blyat, then divide the shit.
 ChutOuLeTcheTche: like this:
 ChutOuLeTcheTche: (var a :let B =&gt; () b.l.y.a.t
 Wontonimo: i think it is safe to say we all just lost a little respect for you ChutOuLeTcheTche  :P
 jzen: TimothyAlexisVass you could do this it like this: len(a) - a[::-1].index(3) - 1
 jzen: s/this it/it
 Wontonimo: +1 jzen

 TheBlueBias: Not especially me.
 Queuebee: Wontonimo do you know whether using A* for Line Racing should be able to solve within 100ms?
 darkhorse64: You do not need A*, floodfill is enough. Even with Python, you can perform 1 in less than 1 ms
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i only remember "HE"
 Queuebee: alright 
 Queuebee: Fun
 struct: Queuebee yeah floodfill should be fast enough
 Queuebee: I never c o n s c i o u s l y used _floodfill_
 Queuebee: idk how to do it
 Astrobytes: Oh. You again.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: yup, 
 TheBlueBias: HIM !scream:
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: its been like 4 weeks, right?
 Astrobytes: should I just ban you now or will you get out of chat and shut up?

 Sarstan: I'm doing Line Racing in C# and I can't seem to use the integers of the starting and current locations outside of the for statement.
 Sarstan: It says "the name 'Y0' does not exist.
 darkhorse64: declare Y0 outside of the loop&#160;?
 Sarstan: Seems odd to have to mess with the starting code. Trying that doesn't seem to resolve it though.
 Sarstan: Use of unassigned local values if I define them in main. 
 Foxwizard5556: what is happening
 struct: starting code works fine for me
 Sarstan: Weird. Just to get started I put in some if/else statements (if (Y0 &lt;10 &amp;&amp; Y1 &lt;19) {moveDir = "DOWN";] as one example where moveDir is what I put in the writeline). 
 struct: are you reading all the inputs before outputing?
 Astrobytes: just paste your code here Sarstan
 Foxwizard5556: there are a lot of newbies
 Sarstan: Reading the inputs? You can't use the variables directly?
 struct: you declare the vars then read the input and store them in the variables
 Astrobytes: Sarstan: Please paste your full code here. It will be easier to diagnose your issue.
 Sarstan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d67a8359-a12c-48f8-b99d-a6e42286e0cc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d67a8359-a12c-48f8-b99d-a6e42286e0cc</a>
 Astrobytes: (it will auto-pastebin)
 Sarstan: I didn't realize it would do that. Thanks!
 struct: the Y0 is outside the loop so its out of scope
 struct: {int y};you can access y anymore here
 struct: cant*
 Astrobytes: *declared inside the for loop
 Astrobytes: should be declared in the while loop prior the for loop
 Astrobytes: Then assigned in the for loop
 Sarstan: So put something like int Y0;in the while loop?
 Astrobytes: Wait. Actually each iteration you are reading a players position
 Astrobytes: So you can leave them in there. But create some player structure/class to hold the xy coords for N players
 Sarstan: I'll need to create new variables to pull those out of the for loop?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Sarstan: Haha, I just realized I read the variables wrong anyway. I thought it was showing start (X0 and Y0) and current (Y0 and Y1) when those are a different player's start.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if you only care about yours, make some variables outside and only assign when i == P
 Astrobytes: It will be helpful to read them all though.
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's cool. Some kind of structure will help you thoughLike: 
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a40d18b6-b10b-49f7-8495-c147cc05e275">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a40d18b6-b10b-49f7-8495-c147cc05e275</a>
 Astrobytes: (not actual code, just to give you an idea)
 jacek: who needs struct when you have classes
 Astrobytes: back in your box jacek
 Sarstan: That for loop is just messing with me on how to grab those values. 
 jacek: dont mess with for loops while coding them
 Vintarel: what is the memory limit for a game (C4 for instance)&#160;? Im messing with an array of only 200.000 Nodes&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Sarstan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d9d1fe7-0e97-4ff6-b7dc-1dd2de6a3240">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d9d1fe7-0e97-4ff6-b7dc-1dd2de6a3240</a>
 Astrobytes: Vintarel: 768mb
 Vintarel: OK thanks
 jacek: 200'000 isnt big
 Astrobytes: Nodes might be
 Vintarel: not at all, but it crashes when i set it to 210.000
 jacek: what does node contain
 Wontonimo: hey Sarstan, are you working on Tron?
 Vintarel: usual stuff... Some Node* and 2 ints and some bool... When i measure with sizeof(), it says a Node does 40 bits and the array does 8 Mb
 Sarstan: Yeah, it's Tron.
 Wontonimo: if you have an array of Nodes, no need to have a Node*, instead you could have an int index
 Vintarel: it might be a bug elsewhere
 struct: hmm with 40 bytes you can store a lot more
 jacek: did you try to allocate exactly 262144 nodes
 Astrobytes: 40 bytes or 40 bits?
 darkhorse64: Vintarel: I guess you are statically allocating, try new
 Sarstan: I need to brush up on arrays. Honestly pretty lost on how to use them properly.
 struct: he probably is storing it in the stack
 struct: since it breaks at 8MB
 Astrobytes: yeah that would figure
 Wontonimo: i don't see you in the leaderboard Sarstan.  Have you submitted anything?
 Vintarel: I am doing a NodePool for MCTS indeed xD i invoke it doing Node NodePool[200000]
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: scroll up
 Astrobytes: Sarstan: did the code I posted make sense?
 Sarstan: Yeah, I'm fumbling around with it now.
 Astrobytes: Cool beans.
 Wontonimo: i'll dm you
 Sarstan: No submission yet. I just started on it.
 Sarstan: I know there's minimax and all, but I wanted to get a framework to play with.
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: thanks dude&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: Have a :taco:
 Wontonimo: thanks man
 Sarstan: Thanks a lot Astro! That works great.
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 jacek: helpful mod oO
 Astrobytes: No problem Sarstan, Wontonimo will help you out further if you need anything else&#160;:)
 Vintarel: Thanks darkhorse64, i was actually creating the array inside of a class&#160;!
 Vintarel: Works now as a global variable

 Scarfield: what have i joined here xD
 JayTeeBat: can you take it off?
 Hyperplane: IDK man u guys were the only one roasting me :fire:
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Run, run away!
 Scarfield: ye
 Hyperplane: LIFE IS UNFAIR AND REALITY IS OFTEN DISAPPOINTING&#160;!
 <b>**Astrobytes holds his tongue</b></p><p><img src="/a/71232104469107" /> Hyperplane: but if life is unfair for everyone isnt it fair for everybody?
 JayTeeBat: this is fair unfairness
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my momma told me life ain't fair, then..."mow the lawn or I beat your ass".   What is the India equivalent of that?
 Hyperplane: 'Help ur momma or I will beat u till u beg for mercy'
 Hyperplane: jk everyone has different parents my aren't that strict
 <b>**Hyperplane slaps Astrobytes around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/71232104469107" /> Hyperplane: /me

 FdevM: what do you think I have to study to solve the problems on this site. Everytime i enter here it looks like everything i learnt is useless
 Hyperplane: 1st year university level to solve 90% problems
 Hyperplane: dynamic programming , tree and stuff
 Scarfield: look at the easy puzzles, on the page before you hit "solve" there is keywords for what you need to know to solve it
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 Scarfield: "External resources SortingLoopsThe Descent - Let's Play"
 Hyperplane: thats too easy
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:?
 Hyperplane: in fast mode most problems are from DP
 jacek: fast mode?
 Hyperplane: in clash of code
 jacek: :x
 Uljahn: eww
 struct: are from DP?
 Hyperplane: dynamic programic
 Scarfield: dont feed the trolls
 Hyperplane: im not troll
 struct: surely not
 FdevM: @Scarfield, i still trying to solve this problem, even saying that only require loops knowledge
 Scarfield: which problem?
 FdevM: "The Descent"
 jacek: most people are strugging with i/o with this site first
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jacek: :imp:
 Scarfield: thought i silenced notifications :expressionless:
 Astrobytes: Scarlenced
 Scarfield: how are you trying to solve it FdevM, paste code here and we can give some advice
 Uljahn: "The Descent" has hints tab on the left, use it if you're completely stuck
 Scarfield: i feel like there is a good pun with you name and sound astro, cant figure it out though&#160;:(
 Uljahn: orchestrabytes
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: was thinking more in the lines of no sound in space, but nice one Ulle
 Hyperplane: where u able to solve the SUM OF SPIRAL'S DIAGONALS problem? was not found on the chat.
 jacek: cosmobits
 Vitruvius: There may be no sound, but there could be uh-strobe-lights
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Would that just be InSpaceNooneCanHearAstrobytesScream
 Astrobytes: (nice suggestions all btw, ty)
 Scarfield: xD yea, soon this chat will have descended to only be pun nicknames
 jacek: :scream: :no_mouth:
 Uljahn: Vacuumnibbles :smirk:
 Scarfield: silent and delicious
 Astrobytes: lol Uljahn
 Scarfield: im off, gn all :wave:
 Astrobytes: gn man, take care
 struct: gn
 69razer69: how did i get 5000cp playing only clash of code
 Wontonimo: you played too much
 69razer69: lol wbu
 Wontonimo: play mad knight racing for more cp
 Wontonimo: easy 3000cp right there
 69razer69: bot ptogramming
 69razer69:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yup
 faktorial: hello
 faktorial: any python developer here
 JBM: not any more
 YurkovAS: MadKnight racing :joy:
 Wontonimo: yes, I confess to being a python developer
 faktorial: I am just learning python
 Wontonimo: for all new(ish) the python devs out there, you may find this link useful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 Uljahn: im not a python dev but better than 99% of professionals according to CG certification :confused:
 Mic74: congratulations!&#160;:-)
 Queuebee: Lol same :joy:
 Queuebee: It's fun though
 69razer69: is there a real job can cg certification get you 
 ninnghazad: mh, maybe a few - but the skills you can train in a fun way surely would help get a good job.
 69razer69: lol i will take a few
 ninnghazad: my boss would have no idea what CG is, or why he should care. 
 69razer69: u working in IT field
 ninnghazad: kind of. programmer at a civil engineering company. simulations, water, climatechange and stuff.
 69razer69: ow i think its normal that he have no idea abt cg
 69razer69: seems like a fun job
 ninnghazad: it's ok i guess. nice to write stuff that is connected to reality - and not just some abstract financial or marketing stuff. and buisness is good, lots of climate change and thus floodings, so lots of projects and moneys to spend on r n d.
 LittleFlea: working all day in programmation.does it become redundant.mundane? i have fuin coding and am scared i would lose the fun in it by doing thing mechanically.
 CodingCanon: Hi! I'm new.
 ninnghazad: that depends LittleFlea - a bad job can suck the fun out of everything. if it's in a field that interests you and you got decent co-workers - then coding is fund even decades later
 ninnghazad: and if it's redudant - youre doing it wrong =)
 Wontonimo: hey
 Kaybae1202: hey
 Thorcode: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hey hey ... what have you been up to Thor?
 Thorcode: Trying to beat you in Codegolf Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: nice!
 Wontonimo: want some tips?  Where is LazyMammal, he's been killing it in golf
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: which one?
 Thorcode: I got my first tip don't use "tab" or enter
 Wontonimo: which golf are you working on?
 Thorcode: CHuck norris :D
 Thorcode: my best is 210 char
 Wontonimo: okay, so first thing is I usez=input
 Wontonimo: on the first line
 Wontonimo: then instead of using 
 Wontonimo: input()
 Wontonimo: later on,
 Wontonimo: i use
 Wontonimo: z()
 Wontonimo: it only helps if you have to use input() several times
 Wontonimo: and only in python
 Wontonimo: what language are you using?
 Thorcode: Python
 Thorcode: I use only 1 input
 Wontonimo: and do you use a print?
 Thorcode: and I just realize that i could do this
 Wontonimo: instead of print(result)
 Wontonimo: you can use
 Thorcode: ifa==b:print(a);a+=1
 Wontonimo: g(result)
 Thorcode: how to use g(result)
 Wontonimo: but only if you print once
 Wontonimo: using
 Wontonimo: g=input
 Wontonimo: then for the last line of your program you can write
 Wontonimo: g(result)
 Wontonimo: to print the result
 Thorcode: gosh I use len
 Wontonimo: len?
 Wontonimo: to print?
 Thorcode: no to caculate
 Thorcode: to change from string to ascli 7bit
 Thorcode: some guy code only 54 char
 Thorcode: how
 Waffle3z: tried a new idea with cttt where I watch the opponent play and see how good I think its moves are and try to beat them if I think their moves are bad. turns out most moves are scored pretty similarly and it can't tell what's good or bad
 Waffle3z: so it ends up going for a draw when it could easily win because it can't recognize weaker opponents
 Wontonimo: i've thought about doing something similar.  thanks for doing the work and sharing the insight
 Waffle3z: a different way of evaluating the moves would probably have better success there since mine is still just a heuristic with some subtle biases that shift the move preference by a small amount, so that move is worth almost the same as another one because I just added .001 to break the tie
 Waffle3z: good moves and bad moves are almost the same because of the way I evaluate them, something like mcts might work better, possibly even if it doesn't actually produce better moves
 Waffle3z: if it's able to detect and beat weaker opponents better than I can then it could score higher
 Waffle3z: this strategy only works to exploit an existing pool of players who aren't considering the strategy, since if p2 is just mirroring p1 while p1 is trying to watch how p2 plays, it's going to get nothing out of it
 Waffle3z: I actually do seem to be beating a couple players though, occasionally. the idea is to identify weaker players and win, and draw against stronger players and never lose
 Wontonimo: so cheese
 Wontonimo: this game needs a fix
 Wontonimo: i say&#160;: random initial moves before the game begins.  just total chaos
 Wontonimo: anyway
 Wontonimo: cool insight Waffle3z
 Wontonimo: gn - i'm out
 Thorcode: how to delete space like this?
 Thorcode: 1 2 3
 Thorcode: I use *e
 Thorcode: e is a list
 ISAI: i know

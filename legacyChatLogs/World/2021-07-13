 dbdr: strange result, scores are usually closer at the top. I wonder if Agade has a bug
 AntiSquid: did anyone join when you ordered them to? Socksfor2 
 derjack: well this noob also has low score <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/569860986">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/569860986</a>
 dbdr: :DI expected I would be the noob
 AntiSquid: does it have something to do with picking wrong branch on the search tree&#160;?
 derjack: picks wrong seeds from right branch
 Marchete: unvisited branches
 Marchete: when I got something like  "NEW ROOT: Visits:1/22463 = 0%"
 Marchete: that's a bad thing
 Marchete: this means the enemy did a move I barely tested
 Marchete: neither on this game and probably not on training
 derjack: and that move was good?
 Marchete: he won, so it was good
 Marchete: oware is good for "prediction"
 Marchete: I usually have +80% of tree reuse
 Marchete: meaning that my move+enemy move were well predicted
 Marchete: but at some cases it drops a lot
 Marchete: to &lt;7%
 Marchete: so it's a terrible prediction
 Marchete: maybe it's a bad exploration, maybe more matches fixed that
 Marchete: but I'm unsure
 martinpapa69: Marchete I too tried your alphazero implementation. my pc has a 10 years old processor, and it does not have avx2, but intel provides an emulator, so now it looks like  it's training :D but i assume the training will be much slower than on a native avx processor
 dbdr: policy_categorical_accuracy: 0.7526
 dbdr: so that's 75% just from the NN, search should help. but then again it's against itself, a real opponent might behave differently :D
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: martinpapa69 if winrate is +90% at first generations it's working
 dbdr: I think it reaches 80% after more training
 Marchete: dbdr that can be a lot of inbreeding
 dbdr: yeah
 Marchete: and it doesn't ensure at all exploration
 Marchete: in fact I'm having troubles to reach the same winrate than in arena
 Marchete: I'm trying other things
 Marchete: but the bot seems to see all possible start moves as losses
 Marchete: no matter the position
 Marchete: losses as 0.0x
 dbdr: all moves are losses? as in the starting position is a loss?
 Marchete: are you still working on it dbdr?
 Marchete: yes
 dbdr: I stopped during the week-end, but looking at it again now
 Marchete: I'm trying other stuff
 dbdr: that sounds like a bug, no?
 Marchete: regularization, batchnorm etc
 martinpapa69: okay. curretly im at the training sample generation step. I set MATCHES_PER_GENERATION to 1k. how much does it take on your processor to generate this many samples&#160;?
 Marchete: it's clearly a bug
 Marchete: 1k matches? not a lot
 Marchete: it depends on TRAIN_MCTS_ITER
 Marchete: but less than 5 min?
 Marchete: around that
 Marchete: also depends on THREADS
 Marchete: I usually use 6 to 9 threads
 dbdr: wasn't TRAIN_MCTS_ITER set with a default value?
 Marchete: dunno
 martinpapa69: i dont think it was
 Marchete: I usually use 1000 .. 1500
 martinpapa69: i set it to 2k
 Marchete: it's ok
 martinpapa69: THREADS=6 
 Marchete: that depends on your CPU
 martinpapa69: its a 4 core HT processor
 Marchete: could be
 derjack: and it doesnt have avx2 eh
 martinpapa69: but im rly curioes much slower the avx2 emulation will be than the native one
 Marchete: you can use AVX
 Marchete: check if fma exists on AVX
 Marchete: but if you have an emulator that's easier
 Marchete: as I said, just ensure it's learning at first generations
 Marchete: usually &gt;90%
 Marchete: if not, something is off
 martinpapa69: my processor does support avx. does it require code modification to run it on avx, instead of avx2?
 dbdr: as recurs@ said, even if something is off it will probably learn, just less well. the 'magic' of NNs
 Marchete: I know
 Marchete: but to be sure it works, better expect &gt;80% winrate at gen1
 Marchete: at least without any weird config
 dbdr: I always get 100%
 Marchete: sometimes is 99.99%, like 1 draw
 dbdr: right
 Marchete: but that's a good initial sign
 Marchete: even with near zero training (1 epoch to speed up)
 martinpapa69: i tried two different alphazero implementations to integrate oware. but none seemed to work for me
 martinpapa69: days of training, still was not able to beat mcts bot
 dbdr: which other implementations?
 martinpapa69: alphazero-general and alphazero-gomoku on github
 dbdr: alphazero-general is pure python, no?
 dbdr: search will be really slow
 dbdr: the NN might not compensate that
 martinpapa69: yes, but i assume after days of training it should slow some signs of intelligence :D
 dbdr: if it improves it has intelligence. it's just one part of the whole bot
 martinpapa69: ye it rly slow it takes like 10-20 seconds to run a game until the end with 300 mcts simulations/round
 dbdr: ah ok, you don't use time control
 dbdr: then speed does not affect playing strength
 martinpapa69: *the framework i use. but ye its a constant
 dbdr: oh, csircsip changed name again :D
 derjack: hm?
 pavlik17: this website it 2hard for me, any website i can practice JavaScript for beginers?
 Marchete: alphazero-general winrates:
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general/raw/master/pretrained_models/6x6.png">https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general/raw/master/pretrained_models/6x6.png</a>
 Marchete: a damn 90% winrate vs a random bot in 5 generations
 Marchete: 40% winrate in gen2
 Marchete: like... worse than a random
 Marchete: who is csircsip now?
 derjack: oh my
 Marchete: how can you train and be worse than a random?
 Marchete: that's only mean... it's wrong at some point
 dbdr: maybe it overfitted badly early on
 dbdr: I agree it does not look good
 Marchete: yet the repo has like 2500 stars
 dbdr: it has good keywords
 Marchete: also, 3 days on a nvidia tesla K80...
 Marchete: they are from Stanford, I would expect a better paper than <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general/raw/master/pretrained_models/writeup.pdf">https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general/raw/master/pretrained_models/writeup.pdf</a>
 Marchete: pitplay vs a random is a nonsense
 dbdr: students
 Marchete: from Stanford
 Marchete: but yeah, students
 dbdr: they compare with "minimax agent with hand-crafted feature"
 dbdr: they beat it too
 Wontonimo: it really bugs me when papers don't put a published date anywhere convenient grrr  
 dbdr: yeah. you need to guess from the references
 derjack: there is some a0 in julia and they made effort to make it available to test against vanilla mcts
 Wontonimo: you mentioned a repo, plz share a link 
 derjack: repo?
 derjack: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl">https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl</a>
 derjack: they test c4 against 1000 mcts and 5-ply minimax
 TheMadSuperstarEater_2483: hi
 Marchete: that repo seemed good, I've read it sometimes and it seems very complete
 derjack: and gets 100% against them in 5 iterations (generations?)
 TheMadSuperstarEater_2483: are you real or bot?
 Marchete: each iteration was 1 hour if I recall
 derjack: still better than beating random 60% after few hours
 Marchete: 3 days*
 Wontonimo: TheMadSuperstarEater_2483 , we are a hybrid real-bot
 RoboStac: yeah, python's slow
 Wontonimo: ha ha ... is it ever!
 RoboStac: my original oware version was based on that alphazero-general, with the gameplaying done externally
 TheMadSuperstarEater_2483: Wontonimo, good to hear that &lt;3 
 Wontonimo: my first attempt at MCTS was in UTTT using python.  550 rollouts per turn.  Compared to my c++ which is 55k per turn
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://numba.pydata.org/">http://numba.pydata.org/</a>
 Marchete: that thing boosts python a LOT
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: I've tested it on some samples and it was like c++
 TheMadSuperstarEater_2483: I am a bot and here to help you. Press 9 for English.
 Marchete: but it has its limitations
 derjack: is this like pypy?
 Marchete: a jit compiler
 Marchete: I don't know if pypy has numpy acceleration
 Marchete: if yes , then it's the same
 Wontonimo: back to training a NN and it doing worse than random when using RL, you can definitely get model collapse.
 Wontonimo: there are a few anti-patterns to combat that
 Marchete: you have a sh*t RL
 Marchete: it's impossible to do it worse than random
 Marchete: you must purposely do it worse than random
 dbdr: sign error&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: if your nn is only battling its prior self, and if its prior self has a horrible cognitive blind spot that it exploits and starts a feedback of focusing on just that one blind spot. Reasonable regularization helps.  
 Marchete: then stop, review, debug and once you are sure it works
 Marchete: then publish
 Wontonimo: i agree Marchete, it would be pretty sh*t RL
 dbdr: what's regularization?
 Wontonimo: constraining the weights of the NN such that they stay within "regular" values
 Marchete: tldr: for me it's some way to avoid complex explanations for simple stuff
 Marchete: L2 regularization: Add some kind of noise depending on weight values, 
 Marchete: squared noise
 Wontonimo: square cost*
 Marchete: and on loss calculation the system adjust it (if done with model.fit)
 Marchete: I mean Wontonimo, I explain it for dummies (no offense :D)
 Marchete: many explanations are math hardcore
 Wontonimo: :D
 dbdr: Marchete you timed out: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/569974310">https://www.codingame.com/replay/569974310</a>

 Marchete: and I was winning
 dbdr: maybe. I have a small stack&#160;:)

 Wontonimo: there are many pages of articles ... nice

 Marchete: one Q
 Marchete: max norm works for negatives?
 Marchete: like if I put 2.0 it tries to limit to -2.0 to 2.0?
 RoboStac: are you trying to 8bit your network?&#160;:)
 Marchete: I'm trying to achieve reasonable winrates with limited ranges, yes
 Marchete: but it stays at like 5th-10th
 Marchete: also I'm still trying my 16bit
 Marchete: still not 8 bit
 Marchete: but as a consequence of that quantization limits
 Marchete: I was checking different ways to limit   the operating range
 Marchete: I've read about kernel constraints like max norm
 Marchete: but I'm unsure
 Marchete: maybe I broke my bot with all these changes 
 Wontonimo: have you looked at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_integer_quant">https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_integer_quant</a>
 Marchete: yes, but still never used it
 Marchete: maybe I'd go that way
 Marchete: but I still think that pure int16 can bea feasible
 Marchete: it's just a matter of putting the right range and adjust clipping relu to the factors

 Wontonimo: yeah, i saw that too&#160;!  too funny.
 Wontonimo: looks like test data
 dbdr: machine learning make up, that should work
 dbdr: just need data
 Wontonimo: if it is an RL make up machine, there will be millions of ugly applications first 
 Marchete: it seems codingame's chat
 Marchete: 1 line it's about beards, then suddenly goes to a very deep ML chat
 dbdr: chat model collapse
 Marchete: NN chat collapsing, and next is AutomatonNN asking euler about something

 Q12: Wow, this is meanI'm doing it right away :smiling_imp:
 martinpapa69: are you still here Marchete&#160;?
 Westicles: come after me bro
 Marchete: more or less
 Marchete: what's up?
 martinpapa69: is there any reason why the "exp256_ps"  function is used, instead of its "fast" version? the second one looks easier to convert to avx
 Marchete: second one has much less accuracy
 Marchete: I'd like some intermediate function
 Marchete: also, it's used only once in each NN prediction
 Marchete: it doesn't seem a bottleneck right now
 Marchete: probably tanh is more costly rn
 martinpapa69: i see
 RoboStac: I don't even bother trying to avx the softmax. 
 RoboStac: it's such a tiny part of the total time
 Marchete: this guy knows
 martinpapa69: for me the main "bottleneck" is to convert the avx2 calls to avx ones, so i might end up with a non-vectorized activation func
 martinpapa69: but i mcurious how much does this difference of accuracy between the two implementations affect the final result of the training
 Marchete: you can remove all AVX
 Marchete: and let the compiler autovectorize
 Marchete: in fact I think jace_k does that
 Marchete: just a note, when compiling to send to CG maybe you need to force the target machine to have avx2
 Marchete: to optimize the sent binary
 Marchete: it doesn't need to be runnable in your pc
 martinpapa69: ye sure. run the train code on windows
 martinpapa69: *I
 Marchete: I usually code/debug/profile on win
 fbaker: yoooo, how do I disable this chat window?
 Marchete: but sometimes VS C++ is slower

 Marchete: no no no
 Marchete: nnues!
 Marchete: efficiently updatable neural networks
 RoboStac: pretty sure they'd be less effiecient for oware anyway
 RoboStac: well, I guess they work for 1/2 seed moves that don't capture
 Marchete: and connect4? :innocent:
 RoboStac: would probably make a lot of sense there
 Marchete: send C4 nnues
 Marchete: imo nnues in 1st layer when one-hot are dead simple
 Marchete: on board games with 1 bit change
 Marchete: just add weights for that input
 Marchete: done
 Marchete: and non one-hot are (newvalue-previousvalue)*weight[input] 
 Marchete: I think
 jacek: for c4 only 1 bit is changed per move
 jacek: for bt, at most 6 squares are changed (with my inputs)
 Marchete: 6?
 Marchete: pawn + eaten?
 jacek: attacked/defended squares
 Marchete: ok
 dbdr: is oware balanced for p1/p2?
 RoboStac: I think p1 has a slight advantage
 Marchete: robo vs robo = win p1
 RoboStac: not got any real proof but it usually seems to be slightly favoured
 Marchete: I agree
 RoboStac: from lots of training 
 Marchete: when I sometimes win robo or jacek it's usually p1
 Marchete: p2 I just consider ties as a "win" vs top players

 Wontonimo: stateless mutators 
 Marchete: sed can read and save on files
 Marchete: I won't say it's stateless

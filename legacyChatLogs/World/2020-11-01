 Majeck: Skynse
 Majeck: Vectors mate
 Majeck: Center them on the center of the pool and then you have two options:
 Majeck: A) Add an angle of 180 to the vector center_pool -&gt; cat
 Majeck: B) Multiply the vector center_pool -&gt; cat by -1
 Majeck: B )
 Majeck: B)
 Majeck: Huh
 aeixovu: I haven't been around in some time. Last I knew javascript engine was spidermonkey, but I heard that node is the engine now?
 AnyaA: ye
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>says Node here
 aeixovu: Thanks. Any link on how they are implementing readline()&#160;? (I'm looking for it, but not finding anything)
 eulerscheZahl: readline implementation:

 Q12: Hi, I have a question.I am making a contribution and every time I edit the contribution the number of views increases. When I release the contribution to the public the number of views will be reset?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but does that really matter?
 eulerscheZahl: I have a private contribution with 57 views

 Q12: Why does it think it is paste bin?
 jacek: because it was few lines and long
 eulerscheZahl: 5 lines =&gt; pastebin
 zTTK: Does the chat here have a limit? i don't see any
 eulerscheZahl: the toad avatar is enough to make people look at it :P
 eulerscheZahl: the char limit is 10k chars for pastebins
 eulerscheZahl: and at some lower limit (600?) the text turns into a pastebin
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47b34afb-1784-4c7d-ac29-cfd362230764">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47b34afb-1784-4c7d-ac29-cfd362230764</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 600 is as pastebin already, we could do binary search
 eulerscheZahl: 300aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 eulerscheZahl: 300 still shown
 wlesavo: lol
 jacek: poor trictrac, all allone in the blocking league
 Light-Bringer: Hey I m doing the stock exchange losses and the large dataset is timing out
 Light-Bringer: the code is not that complex
 Light-Bringer: could it be because of the type of the data
 Light-Bringer: int vs long?
 jacek: or inefficient algorithm
 Light-Bringer: i mean it s only a loop in a loop
 Light-Bringer: i m not even parsing twice the list
 rwilson: Light-Bringer the timing is quite tight&#160;;) but it doesn't NEED to be a super awesome approach .. just look for where the time is being spent and figure out a way to make that faster
 jacek: i havent solved that puzzle so i dont know :v
 rwilson: look for someplace where you're looking at all the values, over and over again...  - there are a couple easy ways to avoid that .. 
 kovi: i have mixed up d&amp;b top pretty hard
 jacek: oh my
 Light-Bringer: alright so i m just scanning all the values first then just doing the loos calc for each value during zhich i check for the next values for the loss max as it is chronological
 Light-Bringer: I dont really see how you can avoid that second part
 Light-Bringer: the first is mandatory you have to go through once
 Light-Bringer: but the loop in the loop is also needed
 Light-Bringer: if youu dont do that the min can be found before the max and it s not good
 rwilson:&#160;;) there IS a way to do it in 1 pass.. 
 rwilson: but...  you can make the loop in a loop work, if you're clever
 rwilson: main thing - if you have to scan the whole thing for max / min each loop...   then it's likely to be too slow...  gotta speed that up
 Light-Bringer: ii m not
 Light-Bringer: i m scanning for the loss directly in a loop in the loop that goes through all the values
 Light-Bringer: the second one only goes through the values after the the element that is being scanned
 Light-Bringer: and you need that to not get the min before the max
 Light-Bringer: unless you can reverese a lost?
 Light-Bringer: list*
 Light-Bringer: at this point once sweep is all you need
 Atomic_Nuclear_WARHEAD: wow
 jacek: its like dual horse racing: you can do loop in a loop which is O(n^2) but it timeouts for 10000 horses
 jacek: or you can be more clever and do it in O(nlogn) which it passes
 rwilson: Light-Bringer - suppose you're at the 3rd value out of 99999 and the next MIN you found is 3/4 of the way to the end ...  do you REALLY need to look at point 5,6,7 ...  when you're loop advances by 1 to point 4&#160;?
 Light-Bringer: xD thanks for the paraphrase
 Light-Bringer: got it&#160;:)
 Atomic_Nuclear_WARHEAD: wa lao
 MeMBuK: hello everyone
 PanosTk: |&gt;?
 Jotark: Why does it give different values between the site and virtual studio&#160;? (c++)
 arkwaw: perhaps you have some uninitialized values
 Jotark: not rly, i dont even know how it is possible to give me the value it is given in the site, at least in visual studio it makes sense
 Jotark: Doing Chuck Norris btw
 eulerscheZahl: but what's "virtual studio"? :D
 Jotark: -.-
 Jotark: visual* -.-
 Jotark: And i canÂ´t be sure but in visual studio i think it gives the right awnser
 harelref: yo yo
 harelref: Who's up for Rocket League afterwards?
 HarveyGW: lol
 TBali: @eulerscheZahl Thanks for the answer with SameGame.
 eulerscheZahl: a disappointing one, i know. you can't beat offline solving, so you have to do it yourself to be competitive
 hem123: anyone did mars lander 3?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, random search. sometimes i get the bonus award (save 400 liters), sometimes i don't find the target at all :D
 kovi: hardcode: or just accept non-top10
 kovi: i mean stick to no hardcode
 eulerscheZahl: i really prefer topcoder in that matter
 eulerscheZahl: 2k testcases *AFTER* the contest
 eulerscheZahl: you could hardcode now but there's no point in doing so
 kovi: yes, but that may not work for contest without deadline
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 SamGoldFisher: Hello, Sorry to interrupt. Anyone did the puzzle of the week?
 SamGoldFisher: I do struggle with only the suicidal move while submitting and I don't understand why...
 tekki: no sorry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what is it, Go?
 SamGoldFisher: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 4 directions right?  if all 4 directions are enemy or over the edge...then you have to flood those directions...if any of those areas of enemies can be removed, then its a valid move....so are you flood checking those directions?
 SamGoldFisher: I do, 
 SamGoldFisher: Actually it's more like I am looking for a "." in the neighboorhood but it seemed to do the job 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup
 SamGoldFisher: but I don't pass the tests while submitting and I don't know why
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, puzzle of weeks say chess board analyzer ... is there an Atari Go puzzle?  or just bot games?
 SamGoldFisher: atari go puzzle
 MACKEYTH: Well, blow me down; Java FTW for once.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is is medium, easy?
 SamGoldFisher: it says Hard on the presentation page
 MACKEYTH: I've been reading about hashtables all morning, and it turns out Java includes a perfectly good implementation.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh its called a Game of Go
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup i just do a flood and determine if it's closed or not,  I don't know what to say beyond that
 SamGoldFisher: Ok, sorry for the disturbance. I will look at it again.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not disturbed, g/l
 GG1991: Stupid question, how to indent automatically in VIM mode? The "=" key does not work as in Vim.
 jacek: vim is so addictive, i cant quit it
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 GoogleJeff: lol
 jribeast: how do i make private game
 jacek: private clash?
 Illedan: Private CSB?
 jacek: private puzzle?
 jribeast: no just private game i have no idea where the option is
 jacek: there is nothing like "private game". you can start private clash in clash tab in buttom
 jribeast: i see
 jribeast: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: another puzzle down, sliding puzzle, *yawn*. laterz.
 inoryy: Illedan CSB should be done proudly out in the open
 jacek: keep it PG-13
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 waterboy: what dose
 waterboy: CS0120: An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property 'Solution.min'
 waterboy: mean
 yurv: first create object from class and then use object.min
 waterboy: ok

 Zenoscave: What's a good multi for applying mcts? 
 aCat: UTTT
 Zenoscave: thanks aCat
 aCat: but you have to be blazingly fast
 Zenoscave: that's what I was thinking
 aCat: for other things I nearly always suppose evo is better
 Zenoscave: evo?
 aCat: maybe hypersonic
 aCat: evolutionary / genetic algorithms
 Zenoscave: ah right

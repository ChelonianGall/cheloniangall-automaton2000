 AbundantPuddle: I have faith in you.
 AbundantPuddle: :pray_tone2:
 c0nc4c: lmao Vietnamese
 RainbowMan: :nose_tone5: network error
 jrke: dbdr why&#160;:(
 dbdr: jrke, why what?
 jrke: you thrashed my bot decreased my points&#160;:
 jrke: np i will work on it
 dbdr: you're #1 now :D
 jrke: just for few seconds from now
 dbdr: not sure, I'm losing some matches
 dbdr: I fixed a bug, but probably have another one
 Marchete: what game?
 dbdr: even lost against darkhorse64
 jrke: d&amp;b
 jrke: but not against me dbdr
 dbdr: &amp;d&amp;r
 dbdr: true
 Marchete: d&amp;b&amp;d&amp;r
 dbdr: game custom-made for me&#160;;)
 dbdr: dots and boxes and dashes and railroads
 Marchete: I dislike inputs and outputs in D&amp;B
 jrke: i think tric trac bot have adaptive nature according to opponent moves :thinking:
 Marchete: like A1? wth is that?
 dbdr: Marchete, indeed, it's a bit tricky at first
 Marchete: A1 T = A2 B
 dbdr: but not that hard to convert to whatever you prefer
 Marchete: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 dbdr: just preprocess the input
 Marchete: I know
 dbdr: do you have auggestion for a better notation?
 dbdr: there, jrke still #1&#160;;)
 jrke: your bot is better than me my bot is better than tric trac and tric trac bot is better than you what is this :smiley:
 Marchete: people that start arrays or indexes at 0 should be tortured until they stop doing it
 Marchete: at 1
 Marchete: I mean, sorry
 dbdr: lua ftw
 dbdr: whole language forces 1-based arrays
 dbdr: don't go near lua then Marchete&#160;:)
 Allis: Explicit iteration is so primitive anyway.
 jrke: dbdr whats your current strategy
 dbdr: Allis: iteration is not the only thing you can do with arrays
 dbdr: jrke: not big change, still minimax, just fixed a bug
 dbdr: and don't worry too much about my current behaviour, pretty clear there's still a bug
 jrke: but how can you defeat me in too many matches if you have bug??
 dbdr: you have zero bugs?
 jrke: no,but i didn't discovered them
 dbdr: ^
 darkhorse64: Losing against my bot is a kind of achievement
 dbdr: yes, I'm proud of it :D
 jrke: yeah dbdr lost one against dbdr
 fschuetz04: @Allis Can you please share your CoC code? Would be awesome
 Allis: @fschuetz04 Shared the one where you got me by a character with a very clever approach.
 darkhorse64: I have not invested much time in it but it seems that there are quite powerful heuristics in the game: I mean, long term ones
 darkhorse64: I wonder what is the right data structure for D&amp;B, two bitboards  for the edges&#160;? Fast but how to deal with chains&#160;? Half winged edges for the chains&#160;? Looks big and slow for searching
 dbdr: half winged?
 Illedan: Damn, I feel targeted in DB -.-
 Marchete: Illedan :eyes:
 dbdr: we'll all conspiring against you Illedan
 jacek: ohai
 Illedan: Knew it was something
 Illedan: :thinking:
 dbdr: please don't visit #IlledanConspiracy
 dbdr: that's where we coordinate
 dbdr: ok, you can now
 darkhorse64: Half winged edge is a topological data structure for representing a mesh
 Marchete: sh*t he caught us!
 jacek: for now d&amp;b seems very meta
 jacek: you can make perfect bot for strong player and lose to others
 dbdr: interesting, darkhorse64. ever heard of it before
 Marchete: Yeah I can't think on a good data structure for D&amp;B
 dbdr: jacek, isn't it because many bots are deterministic?
 Illedan: Random INC
 dbdr: or almost deter
 Illedan: Sorry
 Illedan: new Random(42); =&gt; new Random();
 Illedan: BOOM
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: the heuristic is deterministic
 Illedan: Lol
 jacek: so rhymy
 Illedan: And I won the first match
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: My 42 seed was always losing vs dbdr
 darkhorse64: Because it has topology information, you can count polygon edges, move to another polygon, follow a chain of edges
 dbdr: of course, Illedan, I always optimize against 42
 dbdr: that seed is canonical
 Marchete: 42 doesn't mean anything...
 dbdr: ^ sacrilege!
 Marchete: :D
 dbdr: 42 means everything
 dbdr: if only you know how to interpret it
 jacek: does CG/trueskill support score-bounded wins?
 Allis: How do you mean?
 dbdr: TS only use WDL info, not match scores
 jacek: i.e. in tournament othello, if there is draws in winning/losing, the disc score it used for ties settling
 dbdr: no
 jacek: meh
 Allis: There's no drawing on CG, right?
 JBM: can happen
 dbdr: a game can do that by playing two rounds
 Allis: And competitors will share the same rank?
 dbdr: so the game writer can do it, jacek
 jacek: so i am safe in d&amp;b assuming game ends with score 25
 jacek: after that moves are rather random
 dbdr: yes
 jrke: dbdr fixed bug?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: still not perfect
 jrke: oh
 dbdr: hey, Marchete joined&#160;:)
 Illedan: :scream:
 jrke: hey marchete welcome to wood 1
 dbdr: we are all doomed!
 dbdr: doooooomed...
 fabulus: rawan share code pls
 jrke: 2 ongoing submission by illedan and marchete
 Illedan: Marchete going for Int.Min score and get -1 to get Int.Max
 Marchete: nah,
 Marchete: it's still broken
 Illedan: I added a new IF
 Marchete: like fixed depth minimax
 Marchete: so it crashes
 Illedan: Saw 1 replay. Didn't work
 Illedan: Oh well
 Marchete: also I need to recheck the data structure
 Illedan: Anyway, I'm off. Bye
 Marchete: bye
 dbdr: Illedan it worked, you made me drop
 jrke: but made you first again :stuck_out_tongue:
 darkhorse64: make dbdr great again
 jrke: how can i generate different random no. each time in c++
 jacek: how do you generate the same random number now? o.O
 darkhorse64: change your seed according to current time
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/221/">https://xkcd.com/221/</a>
 darkhorse64: imho, it's a bad thing, you'll never be able to reproduce a bug
 darkhorse64: determinism (as winning all games) is a good thing
 jacek: srand(uint64_t(&amp;main) ^ time(NULL));
 dbdr: lol
 darkhorse64: srand(time(NULL))&#160;?
 jacek: though i dont use rand() for random
 darkhorse64: xorshift for me
 jrke: jacek then what you use for random int
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/698afde2-ed3b-48df-9bd5-e223762b6518">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/698afde2-ed3b-48df-9bd5-e223762b6518</a>

 Kalam132: does anyone here uses machine learning for some game?
 jrke: dbdr whats the maximum time your bot is using per turn
 dbdr: 50 ms
 jacek: machine learning for eval parameters optimization
 jrke: i think coders strike back and oware abapa also kalam132
 Marchete: there are D&amp;B puzzles around there? not for 7x7 but for other sizes, kind of chess puzzles "white wins"
 Marchete: are there*
 darkhorse64: There is a book on D&amp;B with problems and lots of interesting resources (hint, hint, ...)
 TheSpiffiest: Ha. Just catching up. Was thinking for the game of the week brackets. Return random true/false
 TheSpiffiest: with enough submissions it should pass
 darkhorse64: The Dots and Boxes Game: Sophisticated Child's Play
 darkhorse64: Solve the puzzle. You will spend less time submitting
 Marchete: I know, but I can't find it yet
 dbdr: 1 chance over 2^N to get it right randomly
 TheSpiffiest: Yep
 darkhorse64: 1 chance on 1 to fail because of captcha
 dbdr: and there are many problems per testcase, no?
 darkhorse64: Update your antivirus and look for the pdf
 dbdr: so N is large
 TheSpiffiest: Does submitting something a billion times look somehow automated? 
 dbdr: billion is probably not enough
 dbdr: glhf
 dbdr: N=30 needs a billion
 TheSpiffiest: that's what the test cases are for extended adition
 TheSpiffiest: building a tree to search
 dbdr: there are several problems per testcase
 jacek: you can still narrow the search space
 jacek: try to solve at least some cases
 dbdr: solve it all =&gt; 1/1&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: My solution is 65 lines C++. Come on&#160;!
 TheSpiffiest: For the brackets game of the week?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 JBM: but is it worth that much?
 darkhorse64: Actually, it works for  both edition. Yes, it's too long
 TheSpiffiest: That's awesome. I've been doing this for 20 years and I'm just getting back into the complicated bits. Mostly I do enterprise stuff
 JBM: you've been solving brackets for 20 years?!
 TheSpiffiest: for eternity: 
 JBM: my, my, and I thought I had a boring job
 dbdr: show us your one-liner, JBM&#160;:)
 jrke: dbdr why is this i can defeat you various time when im player 2 in ide but when im submiiting i loose all&#160;??
 JBM: i don't remember
 TheSpiffiest: lol
 JBM: is this the one you can regex out?
 dbdr: jrke: rust is faster in submission, that might explain it
 jrke: means 
 dbdr: you do win sometimes in submission too, though
 darkhorse64: Bot hiding
 Marchete: "My solution is 65 lines C++. Come on&#160;!" I thought you were talking about D&amp;B :D
 dbdr: :D
 TheSpiffiest: darkhorse64 - so what algorithm did you use? Curious. 
 darkhorse64: My D&amp;B is 55
 dbdr: JBM, what's your job?
 darkhorse64: Deceptively simple. I make sure brackets match by storing depth
 JBM: i push bits
 darkhorse64: One by one&#160;?
 JBM: hand-pushed
 JBM: with &lt;3
 JBM: quality made in the EU
 darkhorse64: I push chars on my editor, 8 bits by 8 bits. It's faster
 JBM: not as much opportunity for &lt;3
 dbdr: push bits on a stack?
 TheSpiffiest: That's a good solution
 JBM: i don't know where they go
 dbdr:  /dev/null
 JBM: i'm only in charge of the pushing part
 darkhorse64: Team work
 JBM: possibly
 TheSpiffiest: I discovered I will work on a problem for a week without asking for help, then with a hint it should have taken an hour or two... trying to change that.
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/gdtZv3XROnc?t=53">https://youtu.be/gdtZv3XROnc?t=53</a>
 jrke: dbdr means we can't trust rust in local ide?
 darkhorse64: A week for a CG puzzle is too much. If you get stuck after a few hours, you need help. But  it's definitely a good thing to be on your own for some time
 JBM: depends on the puzzle i'd say&#160;:)
 jacek: rust is meh in ide
 dbdr: trust rust or go bust
 dbdr: you must
 JBM: trust rust you must lest you bust?
 dbdr: just trust rustor go bust you must
 dbdr: does that count as a haiku?
 JBM: no
 darkhorse64: Don't want to start another level debate, I'd say you get faster with more experience
 jrke: you must trust rust or just bust :stuck_out_tongue:
 dbdr: damn, still got to work on my poem
 darkhorse64: Haiku is a three liner
 dbdr: just trust rustor go bustyou must
 jacek: rust leads to lust
 JBM: ...then we'll talk verse metric
 JBM: i had 5/7/5 in head, but i've been out of that game for VERY long
 dbdr: just realized rust might be interesting in Japan
 jacek: thats lacist
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: "I love rust" :D
 jrke: will work later bye
 jrke: going to do school homework :nerd:
 dbdr: 3/3/2haikus are too long anyways
 Uljahn: tankas are even longer
 dbdr: :no_mouth:
 Uljahn: "Haiku poetry is composed of 5–7–5 syllables with three lines, while Tanka is composed of 5–7–5–7–7 with five lines"
 JBM: \o/ long-term memory
 dbdr: what did you eat last night JBM?
 JBM: errr what's that got to do with anything
 Uljahn: middle-term memory
 TheSpiffiest: try to code in rustto make all my code robusterror go adjust

 dbdr: OK you're clear then&#160;;)
 JBM: whew
 dbdr: (apart from the "meat is murder" part&#160;;) )
 darkhorse64: Haiku on Rust or Rust on Haiku
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 dbdr: why not both?
 darkhorse64: Just saw there is a new beta. Will we see a first release 20 years after BeOS demise
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 JBM: you must code in rustfutures and pasts borrow stuffjust lust to adjust
 darkhorse64: Too long for 5/7/5. Golf it
 JBM: pass
 dbdr: JBM: nice one!
 JBM: :bow:
 MyoThuraWin: himy name is myothurawin i am from myanmar
 dbdr: that code C plus plussed?just leave that dust with disgustin rust we must trust
 Y0MO: hi
 darkhorse64: CG, the only place where people debate with poems
 darkhorse64: :heart_eyes:
 Alshock: if someone were to do a haiku in Ruby, I guess it would take 3 chars
 darkhorse64: MCTS or Minimax&#160;?Throw them to the dust bin&#160;!Write a NN instead&#160;!
 Alshock: Do we ever actually "write a NN though?
 Alshock: doesn't it write itself more than we do?
 jacek: we design NN. NN fills itself
 jacek: the question is. do we write a NN, or an NN?
 adisher: I am a newbie here. Looking to improve my coding skills in Python specifically. What would you say to me as a welcome message please? 
 jacek: make puzzles&#160;:?
 JBM: as in: "solve" them
 JBM: don't write them just yet
 jrke: d&amp;b is getting interesting now 
 Alisher_Kamolov: hello
 jrke: can srand() take float?
 BouncySludge: hi :P kindda just found this out lol
 adisher: any tips other than the description available in puzzles? 
 Uljahn: there should be discussion tab or forum topic with tips, hints and common mistakes
 adisher: yeah just exploring it now, thanks
 PUCIT: Guys, you all are talking about what kind of puzzles , that you all are playing at same time&#160;?
 Uljahn: nah, solo puzzles from practice section
 Mawkey: How come the C# language assist is not activating for me?
 Mirak42: Me too ...
 FLQ4: goodluck 
 vrabosh: in: 'ыыы (Hello|Hi) ввв (les amis|coders), вввё'out: [('Hello', 'Hi'), ('les amis', 'coders')]re.findall(r'?????', txt), plz:)
 dbdr: Illedan, you're welcome
 dbdr: take your screenshot&#160;;)
 MSmits: I get the feeling I'll be very late to the D&amp;B party 
 MSmits: the math is pretty difficult
 MSmits: to code that is
 Queuebee: is there no code formatting in chat?
 Queuebee: ``` test ```
 MSmits: just make pastebin links I guess
 Queuebee: good one!
 dbdr: MSmits: you might also go straight to #1 when you get something working
 MSmits: well there will be stages so probably not
 MSmits: I'm working on a solver that calculates the end game value when you run out of places to put lines without giving away boxes
 MSmits: loony endgames as they are called
 MSmits: that means you solve halfway through the game without  even having a search
 darkhorse64: I wonder if there is no way to go full heuristics: from what I understand, you need to make chains and when comes the time to score there known ways to keep control. It seems that the number of possible moves can be greatly reduced
 MSmits: if and when I get that working, I'll try to get it into a search
 MSmits: so the first working bot will be a random bot that plays perfectly in end game
 dbdr: loony is not that. it's when you give the choice to the opponent
 MSmits: a loony move you mean
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits:  a loony end game means every move is a loony move
 darkhorse64: Yeah, endgames look pretty deterministic
 MSmits: and that happens when you can not do a safe move
 MSmits: all end games are loony end games
 MSmits: basically
 dbdr: is it a loony move to finish the last chain?
 MSmits: it's like this
 MSmits: you have the controller and the player forced to open chains
 dbdr: that name does not sound right to me
 MSmits: the player who is forced to open, does a loony move
 dbdr: because it's not loony
 dbdr: right, the opening move of a chain is loony
 dbdr: not every move&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats semantics, they still call the whole game after this point a loony endgame
 MSmits: in the papers that is
 dbdr: who is "they"
 MSmits: every paper I read about it
 dbdr: also, semantics is "meaning". I think it's misused here
 MSmits: about 5 papers and half of Elwyns book
 dbdr: OK
 dbdr: (not just here, I've seen many people misuse that word)
 MSmits: they distinguish simple loony end games and arbitrary loony end games
 MSmits: yeah i guess you're right
 MSmits: simple loony end games = just chains and loops
 MSmits: no complex objects
 MSmits: I am sure i can write a solver for those
 MSmits: the other end games are more difficult
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484113827">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484113827</a> frame 57 = simple loony endgame
 dbdr: are there other kinds of endgames?
 MSmits: yes, thats when 3 chains connect to 1 cell
 MSmits: or loops and chains
 MSmits: complex objects
 dbdr: ok
 MSmits: if you floodfill an object like that, there will be multiple parts to it
 MSmits: watching some games between top 3 players, many mistakes are made in the endgame that dont even require search to find
 dbdr: example?
 MSmits: let me find one, sec
 dbdr: thx
 dbdr: in my bot too?&#160;;)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/484123831">https://www.codingame.com/replay/484123831</a>
 MSmits: frame 61
 MSmits: you play a half-hearted handout
 MSmits: hmm no sec
 MSmits: he does
 MSmits: he should have separated the two cells
 MSmits: forcing you to take both
 MSmits: instead he gives you the choice to keep control
 MSmits: or take them both
 dbdr: yes, he does
 MSmits: so thats one example,
 MSmits: let me find more
 dbdr: and I choose not to take it&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, so you benefited from the choice
 MSmits: even if you took it, it was a bad move, more choices is always better
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: didn't find any more in the last 4 games i checked. I do remember finding one yesterday when you or jrke didn't take a free box that was offered
 MSmits: free boxes should always be taken, otherwise the opponent will just take them
 dbdr: yes. for the right definition of "free"
 MSmits: free as in it's not a long chain where you can do a double dealing move
 MSmits: it's just a short chain requiring 1 line to finish
 MSmits: 1 or 2 boxes
 MSmits: so no matter what, you're going to have to open something else 
 MSmits: might as well take the boxes first
 dbdr: sure
 MSmits: that sort of thing should all be heuristics
 MSmits: shouldn't let the search handle it, waste of calculation time
 flameblast12: how can i make an empty array in python?
 dbdr: yes, be kind of CG servers, and take no chance
 MSmits: right&#160;:) But also, if you write a solver and can solve by frame 55 or so, it means you can solve by frame 45 if you add a  search 
 MSmits: but easier said than done, because of the arbitrary end games...  I'll just try to finish the simple solver first
 MSmits: I'll have random bot + simple solver, see if i can get into top 10 with that
 MSmits: flameblast12 an array is a list
 MSmits: I think it's a = []
 MSmits: then a.append("whateva") to add something
 flameblast12: thanks
 MSmits: list, set, dictionary, those are the important collections 
 MSmits: google them if you forget syntax
 flameblast12: yeah
 flameblast12: im completely new to programming
 MSmits: python is a good place to start and easy puzzles give good motivation
 MSmits: if you find them all too hard, you should probably do a basic python course first
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484123495">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484123495</a>
 dbdr: this is an interesting case where I have the control but lose
 dbdr: too many small chains and loops
 MSmits: hmm let me see if i can find a mistake during the end game
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: hmm no, nvm
 MSmits: the hard part is 3-chains
 MSmits: they mess things up
 dbdr: because of the -1 in score?
 dbdr: a 4 loop is -4...
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: so much worse
 MSmits: I dont mean 3 chains are worse
 MSmits: I mean the math formulas are dependent on the amount of 3 chains
 MSmits: specifically
 MSmits: they are a special case
 MSmits: you lost because you gave away all the 4 loops
 dbdr: if I didn't I would lose control
 MSmits: yeah, it's hard to figure out if your bot made a mistake in this, but sometimes giving up control is better
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: this is also not a simple loony endgame
 MSmits: some objects are complex
 dbdr: what's special about 3 chains?
 dbdr: they are long
 MSmits: they are the only chains that give negative points
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: so too many of them and it is bad to keep control
 MSmits: there's special cases for 0, 1 and 2 and up
 flameblast12: how can i post a replay?
 dbdr: but that's also true of 4 loops
 flameblast12: or my code
 MSmits: yes
 dbdr: (even more, as we said)
 MSmits: what i mean is, 3-chains are exceptions in the group of chains
 dbdr: right
 Memo12334: :eyes:
 MSmits: depending on how many you have, sometimes its better  to play a loop first and sometimes a chain
 MSmits: I can't explain exactly why... the proofs are pretty complicated even though the resulting rules aren't
 MSmits: 1 and 2 chains are easy
 MSmits: you just always play the smalles first
 MSmits: in fact, the papers dont even count them as part of the loony endgame
 MSmits: dbdr, I think If you had kept the first 4 loop for yourself (all 4 boxes) you would have wom
 MSmits: won
 MSmits: because then jrke would have had to give both other 4 loops to you to keep control just to get the last chain
 MSmits: hmm no the chain is longer than the 12 boxes
 MSmits: so thats not it
 MSmits: as controller, you give away 12 boxes to get the 14 at the end. If you gave away control 1 step earlier (the 4 chain), you would have been in the same position
 MSmits: I think I got it, not 100% sure though:
 MSmits: at frame 64, you keep control on the 3-chain, sacrificing 2 points
 MSmits: (dbdr)
 MSmits: if you had given up control, I think you would have won
 MSmits: the controlled value of the rest of the game is exactly 0
 dbdr: nice&#160;:)
 MSmits: this is actually one of those cases where 3 chains are important
 MSmits: because there are 2
 Marchete: so this week was "fun", my project at work was cancelled, and police came to my house looking for me
 Marchete: :cop_tone3:
 norbi97: woah, that surely sounds fun to me
 MSmits: what'd you steal?
 MSmits: was the project cancelled because you stole stuff?
 MSmits: I'm just riffin'
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: totally unrelated events that happened with like 4 hours difference...
 Marchete: project cancelled because it will be another new one replacing the current one, and I'll be transfered to that new one
 MSmits: that's not unrelated unless they were beyond the orbit of jupiter, thats obviously a time-like connection
 Marchete: and the police notified me about my old car, that I needed to move it 
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: did you forget you have that car and left it somewhere?
 Marchete: no, because of the pandemic the car was parked for 3+ months, and the battery died
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: but why did it need to be moved?
 Marchete: so I was lazy to move it, but police convinced me reaaaally fast
 MSmits: oh it was parked somewhere it shouldnt
 Marchete: to avoid being declared as abandoned
 MSmits: right
 Marchete: it was correctly parked, but you can't  park a vehicle forever in the same place
 MSmits: well, I left my train somewhere for like 3 months and it was fine
 Marchete: it seems that after N weeks you need to move it
 Marchete: yeah, trains are easy to park
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Marchete: nodoby notices them
 MSmits: my wife had to do a corona test this week and I couldnt go to work
 MSmits: because of a family member that did something less than wise
 Marchete: my wife did it 2 weeks ago, negative
 MSmits: yeah also negative here
 Marchete: she had like really mild symptoms
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: I think I also caught it, but my symptoms were so mild I wasnt even sure
 MSmits: I slept a bit more and had sore throat for 1 day
 Marchete: if I caught it, it was before all the fuzz, around february
 MSmits: had a test scheduled just in case but i cancelled it after my wife's was negative and I never got sick
 Marchete: how's going at work?
 Marchete: less teachers/student ratio?
 MSmits: it's going ok, it's a bit frustrating that i want to use a mask but I really can't
 Marchete: here they seem a bit clueless
 MSmits: all students
 MSmits: no reductions
 MSmits: the best thing they did was implement a rule that students arent allowed in the hallways when teachers switch classes
 dbdr: MSmits, go all Steven Hawking-style&#160;;)
 Marchete: I don't get it, in Netherlands you are like "f*ck that"
 Marchete: f*ck old people, die!
 Marchete: yet you had less problems than here...
 MSmits: Marchete we have a really low infection rate currently
 MSmits: no, we had a real lockdown also
 MSmits: schools stopped completely
 Marchete: we had a damn prison lockdown
 Marchete: like going once each 2 weeks to groceries
 MSmits: well the extra bit you had was not very effective i think
 Marchete: and nothing more
 dbdr: people could not just walk out of prison anymore?
 Marchete: for 3 months...
 MSmits: the most important things are not to go to bars/restaurants and not visit relatives, work from home
 MSmits: not going for a walk outside is pointless
 MSmits: grocery store barely causes any infection
 Marchete: I think it was more about who took the virus (older == harder to beat), and maybe the mutation virus or smth
 MSmits: the most important factor is the moment you go into lockdown
 Marchete: I don't understand how Italy, Spain, France and UK hit so hard
 dbdr: I don't know, you touch stuff at the store
 Marchete: but not on some other countries
 MSmits: if you do it early, then you only have to do enough to get the reproduction rate below 1
 MSmits: if you do it too late, then the damage is done
 MSmits: dbdr the effect is pretty minimal 
 MSmits: mostly it's live interaction
 MSmits: come too close, share breath etc.
 Marchete: too close, then finland is safe :D
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: why finland?
 dbdr: cultural norms
 dbdr: less touching, more distance between people
 MSmits: Marchete Italy was too late with the lockdown, so was the UK
 Marchete: here at southern countries we are more effusive
 dbdr: compared to south europe eg.
 Marchete: if that's a word in English
 Marchete: have you seen a nordic bus stop?
 MSmits: hmm I think it's mostly what happens within families. In some countries it's customary to all eat together, 10 people at once, or do it several times a week
 MSmits: churches are bad when it comes to covid also
 MSmits: countries with more church-going will have more infections. 
 Marchete: that and southern people emancipates later
 dbdr: more than night clubs?
 Marchete: for economic reasons, mainly
 MSmits: nightclubs are bad, but most people dont go there, in many places everyone goes to church
 MSmits: or mosque or whatever
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: communal gathering places
 Marchete: orgies?
 MSmits: yeah that works
 MSmits: and you get std as a bonus
 Marchete:&#160;:)
 dbdr: what I heard recently is, young people are less careful, and then they spread it to their parents/grandparents
 Marchete: you save time, it's more efficient
 MSmits: dbdr thats true
 MSmits: but that's basically a constant across countries
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: well young people visiting old ones isnt
 MSmits: so the countries where they eat together....
 dbdr: so may factors
 MSmits: population density also matters
 Marchete: metro == a lot of cases
 MSmits: I think Sweden mostly got away with what they did because of this
 Marchete: prove me wrong
 MSmits: even though they had lots of deaths, it would have been 10x worse in my country if we had no lockdown
 dbdr: yes. for instance sweden's stats are not bad in average, but they are bad compared to similar nordic countries
 MSmits: other nordic countries had lockdowns
 Marchete: viking gods need sacrifices
 dbdr: and much lower stats
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: lockdowns do work very well
 MSmits: but the trick is how to get back to normal. Do it slowly and watch for early signs. Many times it failed
 Marchete: stupidity beats lockdown, rock, paper, scissors and spok
 MSmits: like in the US
 Marchete: and we are surrounded
 MSmits: you forget Lizard
 MSmits: or do you have a lizardless rps?
 Marchete: stupidity already beaten it
 MSmits: o ok
 MSmits: the cold viruses that are out now are a real problem
 MSmits: if you catch one, do you go to work even if you test negative?
 MSmits: you might get 2-3 days extra work in
 MSmits: but the guy you infect needs to stay home for a corona test
 MSmits: and you may infect more than one
 dbdr: we need to make an optim out of this
 MSmits: lol right
 Marchete: I love remote working
 MSmits: I doubt that it's a good idea to go to work with a cold virus anyway, except when it's nearly gone. 
 Marchete: so peaceful, no annoying people talking loud
 MSmits: you dont do great work and you extend the duration of the disease
 Marchete: no football related chit chat that I don't f*cking care
 MSmits: same Marchete
 MSmits: though in my case, part of my job is the actual people :P

 MSmits: nice
 Marchete: IT crowd, one of the best series ever
 MSmits: I think that's mostly true for people who are in IT or similar
 MSmits: otherwise it's just a good series
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bluffball.com">https://bluffball.com</a>
 dbdr: for sale, only 4K USD :D
 MSmits: do people make a lot of money selling URLS?
 MSmits: I guess you need to get lucky
 dbdr: sometimes
 dbdr: yeah, I guess they buy 100 and sell 1, just depends on the margin
 MSmits: right
 Marchete: especially short ones, I've heard someone bought a 3 char domain just to win a damn codegolf puzzle :rofl:
 dbdr: :innocent:
 dbdr: it was first cheap though
 dbdr: *dirt
 MSmits: are there 2 char domains?
 MSmits: or 1?
 dbdr: 1 + 2 tld + the dot
 MSmits: aa.com = american airlines
 Marchete: I didn't found a cheapo 3 char one, so I ended 2nd...
 AntiSquid: ah we talking about the virus? honestly if it was as deadly as the media likes to exaggerate to click-bait people and generate panic, then we would have lost more people than during the 1st world war
 dbdr: I gave a couple of dollars to the island of Palau&#160;:)
 dbdr: MSmits: to make it cheap, use a non-ascii 1 char
 MSmits: AntiSquid the deadliness is not the point though, it never was
 dbdr: there is an almost infinite number of those
 MSmits: it's the capacity for getting people into the hospital
 Marchete: it is on older people
 dbdr: so no high price
 MSmits: Marchete not even for older people
 Marchete: yeah, because of capacity
 AntiSquid: MSmits did you visit any hospitals recently? 
 MSmits: more older people go to the hospital and become chronically ill for the rest of their lives from this virus than die
 MSmits: it wrecks your body
 AntiSquid: a lot of people died on ventilators
 AntiSquid: it wrecked their lungs
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: and if they didnt die it still wrecked them
 AntiSquid: there's a huge overreaction .
 MSmits: and most didnt
 MSmits: why is it an overreaction
 MSmits: in Italy, people died because they couldnt get care
 MSmits: the lockdowns prevented that from happening in most other countries, excepting Spain 
 AntiSquid: uhm, actually a person i know wasn't put on ventilator because of another medical condition. he is alive, others put on ventilators died
 dbdr: it's also tricky. if hard measures are taken and they work, you can then say it was overreaction
 MSmits: exactly dbdr
 dbdr: AntiSquid: nice annecdote
 AntiSquid: true story
 dbdr: anecdotes do not prove a point
 dbdr: truth is not the question
 AntiSquid: actually, not trying to prove it, just saying it as it is
 dbdr: statistical significance is
 MSmits: they have plenty of statistics on this, they did put people on ventilators too easily at first, but in many case it still is necessary. If you dont get air, you die
 dbdr: sure, it can happen
 AntiSquid: yes how many people died, look at stats
 dbdr: the human body is super complex
 MSmits: AntiSquid again, the death rate is completely unimportant
 AntiSquid: all the protesters would be dead by now
 MSmits: it's the damage to people who survive and the deathrate that you have without any care
 Marchete: UK people is weird, destroying 5G towers because of the covid&#160;:)
 MSmits: that deathrate is actually pretty significant
 AntiSquid: the ventilators are part of causes the damage
 Marchete: is like wha?
 dbdr: there are a few weirdos everywhere
 MSmits: that's the same effect as flat earth
 dbdr: happened in germany too I think
 MSmits: wrong corner of Youtube
 AntiSquid: not adjusting them is another issue, but ya there was massive overreaction
 Marchete: there is no overreaction as soon as hospital are at capacity
 MSmits: and that nearly happened in many countries and happend in some
 dbdr: Marchete: it's a good example of "correlation does not prove causation"
 AntiSquid: do you work in a hospital? wards are mostly empty
 MSmits: if it "nearly" happens, you definitely did not overreact
 Marchete: the ventilators and such is a problem, but I think doctors now they know how to handle citokine storm better
 MSmits: they are now AntiSquid
 MSmits: but they werent before
 AntiSquid: nice comparing me to a flat earther when you don't have any idea about the situation
 AntiSquid: MSmits
 MSmits: in my country they were nearly full
 MSmits: we had to expand a lot
 MSmits: AntiSquid we are not
 MSmits: the 5G thing
 MSmits: i was referring to
 dbdr: nice asserting someone has no idea
 dbdr: when it's clearly not the case
 AntiSquid: then where do you get your facts from
 AntiSquid: because it's not aligned with reality
 MSmits: the 5G conspiracy theories are similar to flat earth, anti-vaccers etc.
 Marchete: well, you work at an hospital, so we must listen you more
 dbdr: tell us the truth, and your sources AntiSquid
 Marchete: but I'm on the cautionary side
 Marchete: like a new computer virus
 Marchete: better take all precautions
 Marchete: until you are completely, totally and 99.999% sure
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's very regionally dependent, but states usually need to make country-wide decisions
 AntiSquid: i didn't mention 5G, but that's random even for a conspiracy
 MSmits: your hospital can be in a quiet region
 AntiSquid: no that's not it
 MSmits: in our country, the south was overrun by the virus and people where transported north 
 MSmits: to get care
 MSmits: so thats serious
 AntiSquid: ok lookup newly built emergency hospitals
 Marchete: even here we had like 3 hot areas, the rest of the country was nice
 AntiSquid: many empty now
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: thats the nature of exponential growth
 MSmits: you need to prepare and you're almost always going to overprepare
 dbdr: or underprepare
 MSmits: well if you do it right, you overprepare
 dbdr: and get blamed in both cases
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: it's like with vaccines
 MSmits: they are making millions of them even before they even know they work
 Marchete: and then you'll have a lot of captain hindsight
 MSmits: because once they are done testing, they need to be able to use them immediately
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdbjw27QPJQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdbjw27QPJQ</a>
 AntiSquid: it's not captain hindsight when it's going on for months ...
 AntiSquid: it's still happening 
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVmEXdGqO-s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVmEXdGqO-s</a>
 AntiSquid: i get it inside hospitals you take measures to protect the patient
 AntiSquid: s
 MSmits: it doesn't matter, you can get infected everywhere. People bring the virus into the hospital even with the best measures. If you have less infected people outside of the hospital, there's less chance of the virus coming in. Same with nursing homes
 MSmits: protecting the entire country = protecting nursing homes
 Marchete: btw talking about dots and boxes, someone have sample inputs on a file?
 dbdr: Marchete: nice one. more concise&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: same with seasonal flu
 MSmits: but the seasonal flu is far less infectious
 Marchete: I can export them, but I'm lazy
 Marchete: and rusty af
 AntiSquid: it kills elderly too
 MSmits: at a far lower rate also
 MSmits: 5-10x lower
 MSmits: and does less damage when they survive
 dbdr: Marchete: bash, echo &gt;&amp;2
 AntiSquid: the virus doesn't do as much damage as the measures
 Marchete: but I meant a whole game
 Marchete: nvm I'll do it in C#
 Marchete: I'm having some issues with my data structures
 MSmits: without any care, corona is probably 5 times more deadly. Also without lockdowns, you probably get a 10-100 times more cases. So you can get 100-1000 times more death without lockdowns, but you never see this, because there are lockdowns
 Marchete: I need Visual Studio
 Illedan: :wave:
 Marchete:  :eye: :eye: :eye: :eye: :eye: :eye:
 Marchete: shhh
 MSmits: the virus does more damage than the measures, because even without a lockdown, you're going to have a lockdown, you're just going to have it later, with many more sick. There's always a point where the country is overrun
 MSmits: if you dont do anything
 MSmits: (excepting low pop density countries with generally careful people like Sweden)
 AntiSquid: disagree with some of the stuff you said, enjoy the lockdown
 MSmits: we dont have a lockdown 
 MSmits: we had one and it worked
 AntiSquid: you as in your country?
 MSmits: country 
 MSmits: bars/restaurants were closed
 MSmits: school was closed close to summer
 AntiSquid: afaik it wasn't as big of a lockdown as other ones
 MSmits: no gatherings
 MSmits: no visiting family
 AntiSquid: i mean less restrictions overall
 MSmits: like what?
 MSmits: I think it was pretty much the same as in France
 AntiSquid: mask enforcement for example
 dbdr: no visiting family was a law?
 MSmits: by the time it was clear how much masks helped, we had already beaten it mostly, but yeah
 dbdr: you can only visit random strangers&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes dbdr
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: we didnt visit relatives for 2 months or so
 MSmits: masks are mostly helpful for when you cant socially distance
 MSmits: but the lockdown was such that you had to socially distance everywhere
 MSmits: masks were and still are, mandatory in public transport
 MSmits: people complain about the economic damage to bars, restaurants and similar, but when people switched to online shopping there were loads and loads of companies going bankrupt. Sometimes you lose your job due to societal changes. It's crap, but it helps if you have a good safety net in your country. We do... mostly
 Marchete: we are going bankrupt
 AntiSquid: by lockdown i meant, there are still travel restrictions, it's not as tight as it used to be, but certain countries you can't visit, 
 dbdr: Spain?
 Marchete: tons of tourism business...
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: AntiSquid thats true, and it changes every week
 AntiSquid: weird bit is some countries you cant visit and those you can visit each other, so ..... eh whatever
 MSmits: oh right, countries dependent on tourism, thats harsh
 dbdr: yeah, Spain has highest tourism per capita
 MSmits: AntiSquid they are making it up as they go, it's not easy to do&#160;:)
 MSmits: or to coordinate
 MSmits: I'm happy I got to go on vacation in my own country in the summer, just at the corona low point
 MSmits: it came back a bit after young people got stupid
 MSmits: illegal parties etc.
 dbdr: UK decided quanrantine for people coming from France, so France did the same, because they said the situation is similar in both countries
 AntiSquid: but part of the way the politicians are reacting to it is retroactive based on media caused panic and to appease the crowds
 MSmits: i agree AntiSquid
 dbdr: it's true, these things are not purely rational
 MSmits: I actually think that is why our schools opened completely all at once
 MSmits: It would have been better to do it like Belgium, open at half capacity first (every other week)
 MSmits: political pressure was on opening schools completely
 MSmits: even while corona is on the rise
 AntiSquid: anyway sorry for derailing chat into this further, pointless rambling regardless
 MSmits: I'm ok with it, it's our daily reality after all
 MSmits: have to discuss it sometimes
 MSmits: but we could go back to D&amp;B&#160;:)
 dbdr: MSmits, it's part of the plot to delay your bot&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol, I am doing that very well all on my own. This math stuff is hard 
 MSmits: well hard to put into code that is
 MSmits: it's deceptively har
 MSmits: d
 dbdr: yes, I think partly because articles/books often speak about things to play as humans
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: not always relevant to writing a bot
 MSmits: also they refer a lot to nimstring/nimdots
 MSmits: which is about keeping control
 MSmits: but that assumes it's always best to keep control
 MSmits: nim doesnt have score, just the last one to move wins 
 MSmits: or loses, depending on the definition
 dbdr: it's because it's a subproblem
 dbdr: so it's useful
 dbdr: there is the construction for this
 MSmits: yes, but it seems that very good D&amp;B players almost always run into situations where losing control might be best
 dbdr: to be able to solve D&amp;B in the general case, you need to be able to solve nimstring
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: but that part is not the hard part
 MSmits: to win at uttt, you need to be able to win at ttt.
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: well bad example, you cant win ttt :P
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: therefore, you can't win at uttt
 dbdr: which might be true if the game is solvable as a draw too
 MSmits: yea yeah :facepalm:
 MSmits: it's either a draw or a win for p1
 dbdr: it cannot be p2?
 MSmits: no, because having more cells you own is always better than having less
 MSmits: and p1 has the full choice
 MSmits: you can use the strategy stealing argument
 MSmits: anything p2 can do, p1 can do also, and more
 MSmits: it's like this
 MSmits: say you start in center
 MSmits: and p2 plays corner of center board
 MSmits: then you might also have started in corner of center board
 dbdr: p2 could have two winning first moves
 MSmits: hmm how
 dbdr: why not?
 MSmits: but why two?
 dbdr: more than one
 dbdr: it's not just 'prevent them from playing their move"
 MSmits: I'm confused though, say p1 starts center
 MSmits: is there anything p2 can do, that makes for a better situation than the same situation as p1 starting there
 dbdr: but yes, I think it makes sense that with one more you are ahead. just not sure how to formally prove it
 MSmits: ok my point is this:
 MSmits: 100000000
 MSmits: is always better than
 MSmits: 200010000
 MSmits: it's a bit unfair though, I've simulated millions of games and it's extremely hard to find even a game where p2 is guaranteed to draw
 MSmits: so a guaranteed win seems unimaginable to me
 MSmits: the game is very skewed
 MSmits: if you do random sims it's around 70-30%, with heuristics on the part of p1, it becomes 90-10% very quickly
 Marchete: it seems that the game is more graph oriented than bitwise oriented
 dbdr: d&amp;b
 MSmits: hmm how do you mean
 MSmits: oh D&amp;B
 Marchete: you mean UTTT?
 MSmits: we were talking about uttt yes
 Marchete: pffft, that's so pre-covid
 dbdr: I was talking about botg
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I use bitboards for D&amp;B for now, but only because that way i can fit the gamestate on the nodes
 MSmits: for minimax thats pointless
 MSmits: unless you have a persistent tree somehow
 darkhorse64: Has anyone found this paper "using heuristic solver to optimize monte carlo tree search in dots-and-boxes"&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: oh you mean a downloadable
 Marchete: all literature goes around chains, cycles and stuff
 MSmits: it's useless darkhorse, i actually paid for that one
 Marchete: paid?
 MSmits: it's the chinese paper right?
 Marchete: like real money?
 MSmits: yep
 darkhorse64: Yeo
 darkhorse64: yes
 Marchete: like for a CG game?
 MSmits: it's 5 pages, has very little information i could use
 MSmits: yeah i was too curious, the title was exactly what i  needed
 darkhorse64: Title seemed very promising
 MSmits: it's crappy, there's free papers that are more usefukl
 MSmits: not about mcts mostly
 MSmits: but the math
 Marchete: "papers", promising title with near zero proven info
 jacek: such dedidaction
 jacek: to pay for paper for a game
 Marchete: most of them are some crappy pseudocode and some winrate graphs
 MSmits: first time i ever did that though&#160;:)
 Marchete: that can be anything  because you can't prove it
 MSmits: none of the useful ones on D&amp;B i found even had pseudo code
 MSmits: they are all math
 MSmits: i found one with what i think was Perl code
 MSmits: but wasnt too useful
 jacek: perl code isnt useful
 darkhorse64: Other than the book (whick looks quite  hard to implement), have you found valuable info&#160;?
 Marchete: perl? I can understand python, but perl?
 MSmits: darkhorse64 yes, rules for solving end games
 Marchete: it's like trying to do an AlphaZero bot with Pascal
 Marchete: and 5x5, no?
 MSmits: if you google simple loony endgames, you will find the paper
 MSmits: 5x5 is mostly what you find yes, but the rules are more general
 MSmits: PLAYING SIMPLE LOONY DOTS AND BOXES ENDGAMES OPTIMALLY.
 MSmits: Combinatorial Game Theory: The Dots-and-Boxes Game
 MSmits: those two are the best
 MSmits: darkhorse64 i also found a pdf of Elwyns book, but wasnt too useful i found
 MSmits: mostly an introduction to playing the game, it lacks the advanced solving mechanisms you find in those other 2 papers
 Marchete: I think I need to use width = 8 instead of 7
 darkhorse64: I read these but, as you said, there are more useful for human players because you have to evaluate when to apply. You have to think in patterns
 MSmits: I use width 8 for my bitboard
 MSmits: darkhorse64 using those papers, you can solve any loony engame at around frame 50-60
 MSmits: simple i mean
 MSmits: many of them are simple
 MSmits: and many are not
 MSmits: but you can brute force those I suspect
 MSmits: using knowledge from simple ones
 MSmits: imagine a mcts rollout
 MSmits: you rollout, to frame 50-60, then solve and backpropagate
 darkhorse64: It leaves you with a large branching factor at the start but maybe you can prune a lot ( trying to make chains for instance)
 MSmits: trying to make chains is not so useful
 MSmits: because you make them for yourself as well as for your opponent
 dbdr: yeah, it's neutral
 jacek: neural
 MSmits: darkhorse64 there is a rule about counting long chains, you could do something with that maybe
 Marchete: what's a loony endgame?
 Marchete: looney tunes?
 MSmits: like, the starting player needs an even number and the other player needs an odd number
 darkhorse64: Yeah, this is why the heuristic solver seemed so appealing. Maybe I should play some online games.
 MSmits: or reverse
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484113827">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484113827</a>
 Marchete: ahh, the even/odd chains
 MSmits: simple loony endgame frame 57
 darkhorse64: I know that rule. Hard to implement with bit boards
 Marchete: yeah I'm trying that
 MSmits: loony means the first one to play has to open a chain and the second can finish it completely or double deal it
 MSmits: the second one is the controller
 MSmits: because he can decide to keep control or cede it
 MSmits: (btw that replay is played by dumb bots)
 MSmits: I use the replay to test my chain counting and such
 MSmits: it's cool to have seeded random, I can just change the seed a bit, get a different game and test it more
 darkhorse64: gotta go for now
 MSmits: kk ttyl
 Marchete: :S

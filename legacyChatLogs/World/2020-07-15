 nguyenletienbao: how to loop through every two element in array? help..
 jacek: which language
 Klient: Use a simple for loop with i += 2
 jacek: or [::2] with python
 Klient: Don't know python so said the most general thing xD
 Klient: If that works it works tho
 jrke: [::2] slice is enough for python 
 Uljahn: "for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:])" gives you all pairs of elements i.e. 0, 1; 1, 2; 2, 3 etc. and "for a, b in zip(arr[::2], arr[1::2]):" gives pairs with step 2: 0, 1; 2, 3 etc.
 jacek: arr :pirate:
 Uljahn: that's what you get being addicted to numpy&#160;:/
 Uljahn: should be of list type ofc not array
 Uljahn: or 1D array, though could work with ND
 Astrobytes: How do you annoy a pirate? Kick him in the arrr-se...
 Astrobytes: (sorry)
 Cedrikus: hello, world
 WINWINWIN: Hi
 Herdre: hi
 Klient: That was perfect, Astro&#160;:"D
 jacek: arrstrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: R - language of choice for pirates.
 DJBrutalCarpet_85b3: 1
 something_ok: sr. how long to ranking be reloaded?
 WINWINWIN: :D Astrobytes
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 JoeEhab12: does anyone know how to join a clash with multiple rounds?
 WINWINWIN: dont understand you... multiple rounds in what sense?
 JoeEhab12: i mean not only one 5 min challenge 
 JoeEhab12: like 3 rounds of different problems
 JoeEhab12: or that needs a private clash?
 WINWINWIN: Surely not in a regular clash, but I am unsure with the private clash mechanics.
 TrapRNotGay: integrals are fun + C

 darkhorse64: Please don't post CoC invites on the chat
 proscripterlol: hi
 AggYzz: hello peoples
 AggYzz: my name is aggyzz
 AggYzz: no
 jacek: good for you
 AggYzz: no u
 Washier: &lt;vuvuzela&gt;
 omer-chetin: why people not sharing thier code 
 AIDRI: hi
 omer-chetin: soo annoying
 omer-chetin: hi
 proscripterlol: guys why not share code please
 proscripterlol: im here to learn
 proscripterlol:&#160;;(
 proscripterlol: it make me sad
 StockBot: lol, we are here to WIN&#160;!
 AIDRI: ok
 AIDRI: i m sad for you
 Washier: some of the opponents are bots. they dont share afaik
 K4Mx: eulerscheZahl, can you paste again the sample game output of Onitama per turn, you sent a sample once here , forgot to save it , its for a pres , thx 
 K4Mx: cant find it on git, is it there&#160;? 
 K4Mx: or ill just hack it in the code , lazy me xD
 jacek: oO
 omer-chetin: neredesin turk
 Laminator: Pirate favorite language: "You may think it's R but me only love is the C"
 Washier: haha.
 Astrobytes: lol, well played
 Washier: I know R quite well. its not the tool for this place, unless maybe if you're training\evolving something. it is beautiful tho when  you work with data\stats
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's common in my field (biology), still haven't got around to it myself (left it for the bioinformatics guys) but I should
 Laminator: Yeah, I have a stats background so same.  I could probably hold my own in a clash of code using R. I'd say it's as easy as Python. Plus it uses a base-1 system. 
 Washier: noice. yes, it evolved from S. biologists and the like were doing data science\ai in the 80's already. Ihe big diff is vectorisation, so you could declare a vector like (1,2,3) and add 1 to that, without a loop.
 Munchkin: Hey, guys, is it norm way to use shield? print(str(next_check_x) + " " + str(next_check_y) + " " + "SHIELD")
 Uljahn: seems good
 Washier: R is a script , so really slow. for puzzles, and especially golf, yes i would like the option, but it doesnt fit imo
 Munchkin: ty
 omer-chetin: HELLO WORLD
 Washier: invite me to a clash moer-chetin
 Washier: *omer-chiten. apologies
 omer-chetin: how 
 omer-chetin: clash not found
 eulerscheZahl: Washier do you know that you can tab-complete usernames?
 Washier: no didnt, ty
 Washier: noice
 Washier: omer-chetin (it works) we missed each other.
 Washier: I will follow you and invite you incessantly 
 omer-chetin: do it
 Washier: promise.
 Washier: i also need some learning on CoC. i wield C# and ruby
 omer-chetin: so you dont know python
 Washier: no. the lack of scoping brackets pisses me off&#160;;)
 omer-chetin: I have simple experience in Python and web devtools Except javascript
 eulerscheZahl: i like python&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: + some experience with Django
 Washier: i'm just full of it big boss euler. python is amazing
 Laminator: ruby is an absolute monster at shortest mode. I can pull out all the stops on python and still lose by 10%
 omer-chetin: thats true
 Washier: yes,  it is so short. i like that
 Laminator: We need some language balancing for shortest mdoe
 Washier: haha. being a c# guy i would say yes. but i would be wrong.
 Washier: shortest mode forced me to start learning ruby. so good imho. for fastest or reverse i will stick to C#, because i know it best, more about the problem solving
 eulerscheZahl: that's why we have 15min on shortest: you can google your way
 Washier: exactly. how i'm learning.
 Washier: i know i sound like a stuck gramaphone, but i really love codingame. my advice to anybody would be,  keep going
 Laminator: I learned Ruby for the exact same and only reason lol 
 Astrobytes: Agreed. If you put the effort in you can learn a lot.
 DiL: I'm also learning ruby just to compete on shortest mode lol
 DiL: and as a python dev, ruby just looks crazy&#160;:-)
 Laminator: I did learn a ton of tricks in python. But it still wasn't enough.  15 min is still plenty of time to solve it in Python and then try to google my way through Ruby.  
 Ripkite: whats up hombres
 Washier: deep discussions bud
 tomatoes: poor ruby 
 Washier: haha. ouch
 Washier: tomatoes, you obviously a top coder. what do you think?
 tomatoes: im not. think about what?
 Washier: dont believe that. but ok, about languages. what lang would you lear if you started now
 Washier: *learn
 tomatoes: same i know. python and rust
 Washier: ty
 tomatoes: python is everywhere. rust is nice and fast. js maybe, but depends on tasks
 jacek: as for "dont believe that" Dunningâ€“Kruger effect
 Washier: haha, my surname is Kruger
 Washier: sharp point though, absolutely. 
 McCheng: Rust is better or C++ is better?
 jacek: yes
 eulerscheZahl: only correct answer :D
 JBM: Nice underhanded plug for D
 JBM: +1 wouldn't have done better
 eulerscheZahl: throw new DNotMentionedException()
 AbundantPuddle: if Rust &gt; C++{gotoAndPlay(D);}else{gotoAndPlay(D);}

 Astrobytes: Because everyone should use the D once.
 proscripterlol: hey guys please be nice and share your code&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I did
 DiL: yes you D-d Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol DiL&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: proscripterlol are you clashing vs the bots that don't share?
 eulerscheZahl: also: nice one DiL :D
 DiL:&#160;:-)
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: first win vs jacek
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/477182396">https://www.codingame.com/replay/477182396</a>
 Washier: wd
 DomiKo: i guess that's good direction
 Washier: has to be
 Astrobytes: gg
 Astrobytes: Are you MCTS or alphabeta-based DomiKo?
 Washier: would like to know also
 DomiKo: alphabeta
 Washier: chest bump
 Washier: how deep?
 DomiKo: like 10 in first move
 Washier: very noice
 DomiKo: then like 7/8
 DomiKo: in worst moment
 DomiKo: mid game so expensive
 Astrobytes: I get 14-16 currently but I have other issues
 DomiKo: full depth?
 Washier: wow
 Washier: 14-16!
 Astrobytes: Do you use a TT?
 DomiKo: or some cuts
 Astrobytes: Cuts
 DomiKo: TT?
 Astrobytes: sorry, transposition table
 Astrobytes: Also, aspiration windows
 DomiKo: no
 DomiKo: i don't really know what could be use of TT
 DomiKo: i just use bitmasks and currently trying to make good eval
 Astrobytes: Well, whatever you're doing keep doing it, seems to be working good&#160;;)
 DomiKo: maybe i will try to do some better cuts
 DomiKo: yours 14-16 is so impressiv
 Astrobytes: Just have to fix my other bugs, currently rewriting. Just finished my offline arena, seems to be working nicely.
 DomiKo: yea offline areana is really useful
 DomiKo: i will try MCTS in some days
 Astrobytes: Yeah I was thinking about trying MCTS variant too
 Astrobytes: But I hope to get multi probcut working with my alphabeta at some point (one day lol)
 DomiKo: i have to read about some varations of MCTS
 DomiKo: because i guess that fully random mcts woudn't be so cool
 Astrobytes: Yeah, heuristic-guided works well for a lot of things. Early playout termination w/ eval etc
 DomiKo: i heard that
 DomiKo: but first i have to find some blogs
 DomiKo: that will expail that
 Astrobytes: The EPT sometimes just becomes a UCB guided tree search, no random
 Astrobytes: I'd say experiment with lower depths and eval when you terminate, experiment with what you backprop score-wise
 DomiKo: interesting
 Astrobytes: Depending on the game, MCTS solver might help, sometimes maybe not so much
 DomiKo: i have to spend some time reading about MCTS variations
 DomiKo: and maybe i would improve on UTTT too
 Astrobytes: There's some good papers out there (and some not so good), just ask in here if you get stuck with anything. 
 DomiKo: i found some
 DomiKo: will read them tomorrow
 DomiKo: and definitely will ask if i needed
 tomatoes: there are a lot
 Astrobytes: Cool. Watch out for the pseudocode in the original MCTS solver paper, it's awful, just read the text.
 DomiKo: oh yea
 DomiKo: pseudocodes and really oful sometimes
 Astrobytes: Aw you saw that already I think
 Astrobytes: Or maybe was someone else
 tomatoes: text is a bit awful too :grinning:
 Astrobytes: lol true
 DomiKo: old papers have that thing
 DomiKo: (new ones too...)
 Astrobytes: hehe indeed
 DomiKo: or maybe
 DomiKo: have you guys some paper
 tomatoes: dont know why they mixed nega/mini in one paragraph
 DomiKo: on EPT?
 DomiKo: i guess about MCTS solver i will read the original one
 tomatoes: i just translated idea to big if tree
 tomatoes: it works and i dont touch it
 Astrobytes: EPT I don't think I used a paper for it, I just did it and then found out what it was after
 Astrobytes: Whilst some of us were working on Oware Abapa
 Astrobytes: Actually, it was Neumann who mentioned it to me. I didn't get it at first then just tried it out and it worked.
 Astrobytes: In that case it was depth 0, just select -&gt; expand -&gt; eval -&gt; backprop
 DomiKo: so when i backprob
 DomiKo: i make it like in minmax?
 Astrobytes: You can, bunch of ways to do it, it would seem
 DomiKo: ohh yea
 tomatoes: im propagating in mcts style
 DomiKo: i found
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b76bd23e-7405-4e16-af33-f546655ed729">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b76bd23e-7405-4e16-af33-f546655ed729</a>
 tomatoes: i think its better with weak eval
 DomiKo: i guess yes
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cs.du.edu/~sturtevant/papers/im-mcts.pdf">https://www.cs.du.edu/~sturtevant/papers/im-mcts.pdf</a>
 Astrobytes: In Oware I tanh to keep it sensible
 DomiKo: in this paper they try to do two things at once
 DomiKo: mcts style is like taking avreage of eval values?
 finnn: when i use lua
 finnn: it prints 2.0 instead of 2
 DomiKo: convert it to integer
 finnn: but why should i have to do that
 Astrobytes: brb, afk 5 mins
 finnn: it should already be an integer
 DomiKo: idk what you did
 tomatoes: yes
 finnn: just doing print(2/4)
 finnn: i mean
 finnn: print(4/2) 
 finnn: prints 2.0 instead of 2
 tomatoes: try // 
 DomiKo: yap
 remi6: '{:g}'.format(4/2)
 DomiKo: operator / return float
 finnn: it's lua
 tomatoes: yes, and?
 RvveSplit: oh this is a surpirse
 RvveSplit: hello
 RvveSplit: oh ok bye
 finnn: print(4/2) in lua should print 2
 finnn: not 2.0
 jacek: ohai
 finnn: lua doesn't have integer/number types
 finnn: i mean float not number
 tomatoes: print(4//2)
 Astrobytes: ^
 finnn: that's a thing??
 finnn: strange
 Astrobytes: Yes. You perhaps should spend some time learning more about the language&#160;;)
 finnn: i come from using luau (roblox's lua)
 finnn: not plain lua
 finnn: so i guess you're right
 Astrobytes: Well, plenty resources out there to get up to speed. Keep going and don't give up
 finnn: i think it's a version thing
 Astrobytes: Alright I'm out for tonight, brain's frazzled. Goodnight/good day guys
 finnn: dunno which version // was added or removed in but it's definitely specific to a version of lua
 DomiKo: goodnight
 DomiKo: see ya
 finnn: literally
 finnn: if you do
 finnn: 5^5
 finnn: it prints 25.0
 finnn:&#160;???
 finnn: not a normal lua thing
 omer-chetin: 5**5 in python
 omer-chetin: use round func
 Laminator: I remember seeing python code where instead of a for loop, they used the exec() function and multiplied the actions as a string by the iteration amount or something, I can't figure it out. Do anyone know what I'm talking about  and can give me a working example?
 Ripkite: yerrrrrrrrrr
 bartekkowalski: YERRRRR
 Ripkite: lit
 Ripkite: we need a more hype chat
 bartekkowalski: ikr
 Ripkite: this is why we get no biddies in this field
 MarkAdell: hey, this is my first time here, is there a way to compete with a random user?
 MarkAdell: like a 1 on 1 contest
 bartekkowalski: not sure but if you just do clash of code you play against randoms but it is not a 1v1
 MarkAdell: alright
 MarkAdell: yea i tried clash of code, it's fun
 Laminator: you could do a private clash of codes
 recreationx: wsup
 Ripkite: anyone else smacked
 Ripkite: bro coding is so much fun
 Ripkite: what you guys use in clash?
 Ripkite: been switching between c++ and javascript
 Laminator: python all the way
 Ripkite: off that
 Ripkite: only good for machine learning
 Ripkite: and data mining

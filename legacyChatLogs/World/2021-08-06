 XadeBlade: I know almost nothing about coding, although, I do code block-based code on scratch.mit.edu
 XadeBlade: is there any really super duper easy exercise that I could do to learn C#?
 XadeBlade: If you want to check my games on scratch by the way, it is XadeBlade
 XadeBlade: Is anyone there?
 ProCoder03: For C# basics , use Microsoft Learn

 derjack: where to learn basic?
 ProCoder03: the first link 
 ProCoder03: after that for something like WPF or winforms app 
 derjack: mhm
 ProCoder03: refer 2 link and browse for it 
 ProCoder03: *2nd

 ProCoder03:&#160;???
 derjack: clash?
 Daverino: yea
 derjack: easy puzzles or more about 'teaching'. though this site assumes you have at least some basics of the basics

 Visual: "Select your preferred solution" but what if they bot hsuck
 martinpapa69: you need to close the browser then
 RickJ: What do I have to do to improve the "Coding Speed" certification on my profile? Just do any puzzles, but fast? Or do Clash Of Codes?
 Westicles: Do the clash of code branch of the quest map

 BlaiseEbuth: Hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: Who's that guy? Automaton2000, do you know him?
 Automaton2000: why it works so well
 BlaiseEbuth: So it's a bot? :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway. When you're a mod making jokes, people are dumb and don't understand, and when you're a non-mod making jokes, people are dumb and treat you as a fool... -_-
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000, level up the debate!
 Automaton2000: only need to find how to use it as a puzzle
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: you are given a string with a chat joke, your task is to determine whether the author is a mod
 Automaton2000: you don't need the @
 Breyden: i need help guys?
 BlaiseEbuth: do you?
 Breyden: yes
 Breyden: ignore the question mark
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. I hope you'll find some.
 Breyden: thanks for the input
 Uljahn: it's ok to ask for help here, just don't expect the solution code
 BlaiseEbuth: How do you know he need help for code? :o
 PikaYuhno: jenny
 Breyden: because im a lvl 3 pleb
 BlaiseEbuth: And? Perhaps you need help for quantities in your cake recipe. How does he know?
 Uljahn: i assume this chat is somehow CG related
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't assume too much, you could be surprised... :smirk:
 Westicles: Yeah, there was that suicidal guy yesterday
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. I'll assume we're speaking cake. This way we have more chance to help him correctly.
 TobiasA: i hate it when my bot beats everyone just to reside below the boss:cry:
 BlaiseEbuth: Do a cake.
 TobiasA: :cake:
 TobiasA: ekac
 Breyden: the cake is a lie just like what the compiler says
 Breyden: wat
 BlaiseEbuth: Why are you trying to compile a cake? Oo
 Breyden: because cake is like a program
 Westicles: Hey Blaise...  Et il parait qu'"on" s'est plaint de moi.  ??
 BlaiseEbuth: On? Westicles?
 Westicles: Oh, never mind.  I was looking at the translation...
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. That's a quote.
 Westicles: Yeah, I thought "we" meant me.  But it was just inscrutable french
 BlaiseEbuth: Nah, that's undefined.
 mdxyasir: hello
 herosnowman: I hate that in the clashes the shortest code wins, which means that there are superior languages, meanwhile vb and other beginner languages will always lose
 eulerscheZahl: choose the right tool for the right problem. Of course you can complain that VB puts you at disadvantage. But I've also seen players learning Python or Ruby just for golf clashes. Or C++ for bot programming
 JohnMelvin: hi

 eulerscheZahl: i'm spreading the rumor of an escape room contest in November
 Astrobytes: Only rumours that it might not be bot programming...
 Scarfield: sounds like something that should be a puzzle instead then&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: or clashs

 Scarfield: oh yea, domi ko joined the creators&#160;:) am blind apparently
 eulerscheZahl: more fun than I initially expected. some thinking and not just speed optimizing
 Astrobytes: a few in contribs too
 eulerscheZahl: and that troll one isn't even there anymore :o
 Astrobytes: It's gone?!
 Scarfield: yea i remember smitsi sharing some papers on D&amp;B, seemed pretty difficult
 eulerscheZahl: we have fencing as the eternal WIP now
 jacek: so you fell into d7B hole like smits?
 Astrobytes: oh jeez yeah
 kovi: thx for push euler
 eulerscheZahl: side effects...
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pruning too many moves. if i run the same code (random move ordering) multiple times, my minimax gives different scores at the same depth
 eulerscheZahl: still better than no pruning&#160;:/
 Scarfield: must be the highest rated WIP not to go into multi, the troll one&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: The castle finaly beat it...
 eulerscheZahl: almost obvious if you keep it WIP for ages and prevent thus prevent it from getting approved
 eulerscheZahl: lots of players will see it. combine it with the quest map that asks you to upvote a contribution
 jacek: im behind the frog... should i go back to d&amp;b :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Take him by surprise! :knife:
 jrke: i always keep trying some thing in D&amp;B and yes if you are not the best go for it!!&#160;;)

 WannaBeHum1n: ah okk
 jrke: euler finally you joined D&amp;B
 eulerscheZahl: top bar: community / forum
 jrke: :smiley:
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a forum?! :o
 AntiSquid: JBM when is trolls vs castle released?
 eulerscheZahl: yes jrke, i finally got to it. still not sure how to reduce the possible moves. complicated graphs involved and not sure how to detect redundant moves
 jrke: for early game or endgame?
 eulerscheZahl: like line A and B resulting in the same situation but not C even if they can be part of the same chain
 eulerscheZahl: endgame
 eulerscheZahl: early game is a total mystery to me
 jrke: you are using chains loops right?
 jrke: or just normal move
 eulerscheZahl: i have some greedy filling of chains
 eulerscheZahl: and undoing the last 2/3 of the chain to test what will happen if i exit early
 jrke: yeah mine is kinda same
 eulerscheZahl: my bot is really basic. not even 300 lines
 jrke: reverting last 3 steps and minimaxing which is best giving control or taking control
 eulerscheZahl: i have a minimax too
 jrke: btw there are some prunings like don't open a bigger closed chain or loop if smaller one is present
 jrke: like if you have 3 closed chains of value - 2, 3, 4then opening 2 is always best
 eulerscheZahl: that would require my bot to be smart enough to detect chains
 eulerscheZahl: i only do that on the fly in the next deeper stage of the minimax
 AntiSquid: minimax for all gamephases of D&amp;B&#160;? 
 jrke: minimaxing all endgame faces for D&amp;B
 eulerscheZahl: yes. so early on it's just 1 action for me + 1 action for opponent minimax
 eulerscheZahl: minimax the entire time for me
 WannaBeHum1n: how to send a dm guys xD
 AntiSquid: go to discord
 xxd: i'm gonna try writing my first MCTS, would normal (not ultimate) tic tac toe be a good choice
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1jxykrj">https://prnt.sc/1jxykrj</a>
 eulerscheZahl: @ WannaBeHum1n
 AntiSquid: add a jumping frog on top of those lines
 eulerscheZahl: normal tic tac toe is fine. easy enough that it quickly convergates. and you as a human can verify that it's correct
 xxd: alright thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and it's the lowest league of UTTT
 WannaBeHum1n: i dont have the new message button
 WannaBeHum1n: lol
 xxd: each node in a MCTS just stores #wins and #simulations right
 xxd: # of wins # of simulations
 AntiSquid: might be because you're a "new user" WannaBeHum1n, not sure
 eulerscheZahl: shall I send you a message WannaBeHum1n?
 WannaBeHum1n: i joined in april
 WannaBeHum1n: so yh maybe
 WannaBeHum1n: if u dont mind euler
 AntiSquid: no, that is the trust level status
 AntiSquid: based on your forum activity
 WannaBeHum1n: oh
 WannaBeHum1n: i see
 WannaBeHum1n: ty for help
 eulerscheZahl: i just upped your trust level from 0 to 1&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: "basic user"
 jrke: whats my trust level? i generally remain inactive
 WannaBeHum1n: thank you &lt;3
 eulerscheZahl: jrke you are 2 - member
 eulerscheZahl: next would be 3 - regular. this allows you to hide a post instantly by flagging it as spam
 jrke: where can i these infos?
 jrke: or this is just for mods?
 eulerscheZahl: good question, not sure

 BlaiseEbuth: There's a forum?! :o
 eulerscheZahl: of course, we were talking about the forum
 reCurse: "Likes given" is a requirement for trust level lmao
 eulerscheZahl: yes. even more than received
 eulerscheZahl: read those about a year ago
 reCurse: I think they reached the point of overengineering a long time ago
 eulerscheZahl: was going back and forth between member and trusted
 ZarthaxX: makes no sense :rofl:
 AntiSquid: some reading can boost trust level on some forums
 AntiSquid: so likes would imply you did read before you liked
 AntiSquid: hopefully
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the forum admin page has a convenient way to access the profile picture without digging in the web dev tools
 reCurse: Why is recurse the second most searched term o.0
 Astrobytes: fame has a price :D
 eulerscheZahl: so you aren't #1 yet? fix it
 AntiSquid: fixed your trust level jrke <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/KboafMi">https://imgur.com/a/KboafMi</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: They want to verify you're not a bot.
 eulerscheZahl: sus? that's Latin for "pig"
 reCurse: Ah spring challenge 2021 caused the vast majority
 jrke: sus?
 AntiSquid: suspicious
 reCurse: Admin devs have way too much time on their hands
 Astrobytes: or 'suspect'
 reCurse: So many reports
 reCurse: And useless features lol
 jrke: where can we see top searches?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean the discourse devs?
 reCurse: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know where you found the top searches. so much to see there
 eulerscheZahl: you can't jrke. a mod/admin thing
 jrke: oh
 eulerscheZahl: and you are one of only 557 trust lvl2 users
 eulerscheZahl: so many useless numbers
 reCurse: Mods have way too much access...
 jrke: cool
 eulerscheZahl: that too
 reCurse: It's actually ridiculous now that I take a look
 Astrobytes: I thought that when I first saw the whole mod panel
 reCurse: A few things actually pissing me off
 Astrobytes: Doesn't seem that anyone abuses it but still
 AntiSquid: not much thought given true, but same issue on other sites
 eulerscheZahl: there was only this one incidence of a mod rearranging the discord channels :D
 eulerscheZahl: (he thought it would be a setting just for him, not the whole server)
 AntiSquid: that was very random rearranging ... 
 reCurse: Ok for a sec I thought mods had access to emails, false alert
 eulerscheZahl: ah, now I found the top searches. i'm at #45 :trophy:
 xxd: whats the #1 top search?

 Astrobytes: No guarantee on that. Just the chat will never be upgraded/maintained.
 jacek: not with that mods' attitude
 <b>**jacek :inbox_tray:</b>
 michaellan: thats too bad
 michaellan: well i reckon this chat is still more active than the discord
 Astrobytes: At times.
 jacek: its more accessible
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hate discord, only use it for gamer channels of local friends from time to time...I always end up uninstalling
 AllYourTrees: same
 jacek: use web one

 Astrobytes: lol
 AllYourTrees: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: irc...i stopped using it when youtube downloaders started working correctly
 stilllearning2code: i did that but i keep getting warning with not processing all inputs 
 stilllearning2code: or something like that
 Astrobytes: outputting twice?
 Astrobytes: paste your code if you like

 eulerscheZahl: astro is right about double print
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 stilllearning2code: not sure how to correc it
 Astrobytes: Also take your input reading out of the conditionals
 Astrobytes: The last line. No matter which condition is satisfied you print twice.
 Wontonimo: it helps if you format your code.  The readability improvement really makes debugging easier.
 Astrobytes: I wasn't gonna say much about that just yet&#160;;)

 Astrobytes: There is also:  while (once&lt;1)
 Astrobytes: oh wait I see you corrected that
 Astrobytes: Try it out and see
 stilllearning2code: couldnt win
 stilllearning2code: any ideas on how to improve?
 Astrobytes: But it boosts?
 stilllearning2code: doesnt move at all
 Astrobytes: post the full code if you can

 Astrobytes: that ==180 looks odd?
 stilllearning2code: yeah i thought its best if i could go boost in a straight line
 stilllearning2code: well i mean my racer moves it only boosts very rarely
 Astrobytes: if (!once &amp;&amp; dist &gt; someNumber) should suffice
 Wontonimo: if in this area of codeif (next_checkpoint_angle&gt;90||next_checkpoint_angle&lt;-90){
 Wontonimo: never mind
 Wontonimo: not in the right league for my idea
 Astrobytes: Feel free to help Wontonimo, trying to debug my own mess&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: well, the first thing i'd suggest is to calculate your velocity
 Wontonimo: by storing your previous location
 Wontonimo: velocity_x = current_x - previous_x
 Wontonimo: same with y
 Wontonimo: then instead of targeting the checkpoint, targetcheckpoint - velocity
 Wontonimo: this auto corrects for drift and turn.  It is part of a concept called "PID Controllers"
 Wontonimo: Here is an example of another game where steering is just based on target location (first link) and then corrected by subtracting speed (second link)
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/574392177">https://www.codingame.com/replay/574392177</a>
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/574392191">https://www.codingame.com/replay/574392191</a>
 Wontonimo: subtracting speed (velocity) from the target location is the only change between those two controllers
 mizlan: crazy how alphazero also uses MCTS
 mizlan: although with machine learning too
 Gerti: yo
 eulerscheZahl: hey, I got 2 wins vs Marchete and dropped him from 3rd to 7th :D
 Wontonimo: poor Marchete&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: ah, he's used to that. year-long rivalry
 Wontonimo: there's various alpha--- version.  I believe one uses minimax instead of mcts
 Astrobytes: Only wins against miklla and MSmits really count in D&amp;B
 Wontonimo: #1 or delete, eh Astrobytes?
 stilllearning2code: i won #1 with that @wontonimo
 Astrobytes: lol, not quite
 Astrobytes: well done stilllearning2code
 Wontonimo: Awesome stilllearning2code&#160;!! way to go
 stilllearning2code: couldnt have done without you guys pointing me in the right direction
 stilllearning2code: here is my final code
 michaellan: with the PID controller strategy?
 stilllearning2code: any improvements?
 Wontonimo: no don't paste full working code
 Wontonimo: yeah pid
 Wontonimo: hey stilllearning2code, try different values instead of target - 1 * velocity
 michaellan: my friend who does robotics talked about that, but it looks too complicated
 Wontonimo: try 2, 3, 4 etc
 Wontonimo: for the mars lander example. the factor I used was 25
 Wontonimo: perhaps tonight to put you to sleep you may want to read this paper about PID <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 Wontonimo: it's the best one i've found
 Wontonimo: very readable, not too technical
 Astrobytes: Also, for something a tad simpler, check out 'steering behaviours'
 Wontonimo: and great examples
 Wontonimo: oh yeah, google "coding train steering behaviours" on youtube.  Losts of great stuff there 
 Wontonimo: good call Astro
 stilllearning2code: oh wow i used to do this in my sophomore year of college
 stilllearning2code: ashamed to call myself an engineer now&#160;:'(
 Wontonimo: what kind of engineer?
 stilllearning2code: EE
 Wontonimo: oh, just think of it in terms of resistors, capacitors, inductors and you are golden :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe not wrong
 Wontonimo: mechanical dampening and electrical dampening are identical 
 ANONYMOUS42: for steering behavior there is an online book that is really easy to understand
 ANONYMOUS42: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/">https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/</a>

 michaellan: yeah
 ANONYMOUS42: cool
 michaellan: i actually have never used it, only heard of it when learning about CTFs
 ANONYMOUS42: i have used it for golfing before it can be useful there
 michaellan: wow, mind elaborating?
 ANONYMOUS42: i mean i have won CoC using it but the solutions are gone lol
 ANONYMOUS42: i have used it to make a shitty perl solution for chuck norris though
 ANONYMOUS42: something like this lol
 ANONYMOUS42: tr -d ""|xxd -b -c1|sed "s/.*: .//;s/ .*//"|tr -d ""
 ANONYMOUS42: not good at all

 Westicles: for CN
 ANONYMOUS42: i thought i was onto something but i ended up dissapointed 
 ANONYMOUS42: my perl solution ended up being 120 chars
 Westicles: You can find better than that on non-golf solutions
 ANONYMOUS42: yeah i know
 ANONYMOUS42: i thought i was going to do it using pure bash but then just gave up and did the rest in perl
 Westicles: You can start with this and all the rest in sed
 Westicles: tr -d \\n|xxd -b|grep -Eo '[01]{7} '
 michaellan: owo
 michaellan: my perl solution for CN is 89char using unpack()
 michaellan: i still am so confused how the top solutions are in C
 Westicles: The C solutions are bash run with a system call
 michaellan: why would that be shorter than bash itself?
 Westicles: bash compressed into unicode
 michaellan: omg
 jacek: oh my
 ANONYMOUS42: the secret's out
 michaellan: i feel like my sequence of s/// operations is pretty optimal... time to port it to bash
 ANONYMOUS42: i have an 89 but in ruby
 Westicles: well, the secret came out on french chat in march.  that is a goldmine for golf
 michaellan: does perl's $&amp; not exist in sed?
 ANONYMOUS42: it does i just used it
 ANONYMOUS42: oh wait i didn't read correctly
 ANONYMOUS42: i don't know
 michaellan: what did u misread as
 michaellan: i am curious
 ANONYMOUS42: i understood it as if you can use $&amp; in perl -p for some reason
 ANONYMOUS42: lol
 michaellan: ah, that is way off xD
 michaellan: but yeah my CN solution uses $&amp;
 ANONYMOUS42: yeah i guess i made the connection because i literally just used it

 stilllearning2code:&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: what do you need stilllearning2code
 stilllearning2code: so i am not understandign what the problem statement is asking 
 BlaiseEbuth: To win
 stilllearning2code: lol no i mean what the expected commands and possible values for the commands can be
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh! You want us to read you the statement?
 stilllearning2code: more like dumb it down a bit
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... But aren't there some specific points you don't understand?
 michaellan: How are opponents' moves represented in MCTS tree?
 therealbeef: the first wood league only has one command i think
 therealbeef: with one argument
 therealbeef: not sure how to dumb that down further&#160;;-)
 BlaiseEbuth: MCTS nodes represent game states, not moves.
 AllYourTrees: (so the moves are edges between nodes)
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, but you don't represent them.
 michaellan: I see
 michaellan: Is it like the layers are alternating "my move" and "opponents move" at every other level?
 AllYourTrees: :thumbsup:
 BlaiseEbuth: More "after my move" "after his move"
 michaellan: understood
 mihei: hi guys, does anyone knows anything about new "examiner" achievements?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah
 michaellan: but the goal, when at "after opponent's move" node, is still to try to "win" right
 BlaiseEbuth: right
 michaellan: how does backpropagation work on oponents node
 ANONYMOUS42: anyone know of a non stupid way to return space separated values from perl command in bash
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to inverse results
 michaellan: $,=" "
 michaellan: so win = lose, lose = win?
 BlaiseEbuth: yup
 michaellan: awesome, thanks
 ANONYMOUS42: nice thanks
 ANONYMOUS42: wait whats that variable that is initialized to space
 michaellan: $"
 michaellan: i believee
 ANONYMOUS42: nice thank you 
 ANONYMOUS42: i don't know how you remember them all lmao
 ANONYMOUS42: i always have to look them up again
 michaellan: i've just been learning perl recently so all this is fresh in my head
 BlaiseEbuth: mihei&#160;: submit a valid solution on a puzzle -&gt; in the result tab click "learn from the bests" -&gt; enjoy voting...
 mihei: BlaiseEbuth thanks
 stilllearning2code: i am still not understanding what index value the output expecting is
 ZarthaxX: what
 xxd: It's nonsensical to use the same MCTS tree if I am pitting two AI's against each other right? I need to MCTS, one to try to maximize for each AI
 ZarthaxX: stilllearning2code you get an explanation of inputs and outputs in statement
 xxd: s/need to/need two
 ZarthaxX: did you see that part stilllearning2code?
 stilllearning2code: not seeing it
 stilllearning2code: are we talking about the same thing?
 Astrobytes: did you scroll down on the statement section?
 ZarthaxX: you are not being clear tbh :P
 xxd: can someone confirm my question about using two MCTS's
 xxd: i just want a sanity check as i'm learning this
 ZarthaxX: for what
 stilllearning2code: so the satement is saying Complete index: make your large tree ont he specified cell complete its lifecycle. This removes the tree
 ZarthaxX: xxd if its a turn based game 1 MCTS makes sense
 xxd: oh, interesting
 ZarthaxX: one level is player1 action, the other player2
 ZarthaxX: like say odd depth player 1 and even player 2
 ZarthaxX: so at each node you check whose turn is and check that player moves
 xxd: but wouldnt the tree get explored in different manners
 xxd: due to one player trying to exploit player1 wins and the other trying to exploit player2 wins
 ZarthaxX: that's why you do an eval that takes into account this tho
 ZarthaxX: say for player1 a win is 1, but when adding it to player2 node it's seen as a -1
 xxd: oh wow
 xxd: so like the backpropagation alternates -1 and 1 as it goes up?
 AllYourTrees: ya
 ZarthaxX: yup
 ZarthaxX: think about it
 ZarthaxX: im player1, i do a move, and then the result of that new state is a win for enemy, so 1 for him
 ZarthaxX: i will take it as a loss, a -1
 ZarthaxX: just add based on current perpsective
 ZarthaxX: perspective*
 Astrobytes: every depth is another players turn, every node in that level is a state resulting from available moves that can be played
 BlaiseEbuth: And there's no spoon
 AllYourTrees: and usually the answer is 42
 AllYourTrees: not always tho
 Astrobytes: -42
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 xxd: ha
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Wontonimo: later Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?
 Wontonimo: oh, i thought you were signing off.  Arn't you signing off?
 BlaiseEbuth: Should I?
 Wontonimo: what does ngl mean?
 BlaiseEbuth: Nam Gloria Lucifer
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 Wontonimo: oh
 BlaiseEbuth: Answering to ZarthaxX 'Lucifer Our Lord'
 AllYourTrees: hahahahha
 xxd: when expanding in MCTS, what do you do if a child state is already terminal node
 ZarthaxX: wtf hahah :P
 ZarthaxX: xxd thats where the fun begins :P
 ZarthaxX: you can just baqckpropagate the result as youy already know it coz its terminal tho
 xxd: so i keep the node as a child, and if i hit it during selection i just backpropagate?
 xxd: okay
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: no problem
 Wontonimo: and that updates both the score
 Wontonimo: and the count
 xxd: perfect
 Wontonimo: because it updates the count
 Wontonimo: it increase the regret factor for the unvisited nodes
 Bradltr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1903103bb92cec127038fec759f43318e625f65">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1903103bb92cec127038fec759f43318e625f65</a>
 Wontonimo: and eventually, even if it was a really good terminal node
 Wontonimo: the regret factor will be high enough that the other nodes will be explored
 Wontonimo: Don't post clashes here Bradltr
 xxd: regret factor is the c*sqrt(ln(N)/n_i) right
 Wontonimo: yeah
 xxd: i'm gonna join this clash and see if i can bonk them real good
 Bradltr: You will
 AllYourTrees: me too
 AllYourTrees: gl
 xxd: u2
 Wontonimo: !I
 Bradltr: Clash I posted is for <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden">https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden</a>
 xxd: i saw his stream appear on my feed today earlier while i was testing my irc client on twitch chats :D
 Bradltr: I dont know if you saw but he reviewed your solution&#160;:) 
 xxd: yup i saw&#160;:) not my proudest solution but i'll take a #1/40-something anyday
 Astrobytes: those links appear in #clash and on the discord so no need to post them in World (or any country) chat
 xxd: if everybody at high leagues is using MCTS (i assume), is the goal just to see who can squeeze more iterations in?
 xxd: wait a second....
 xxd: from our earlier chat where we talked about 1 and -1 backpropagation
 xxd: isnt that congruent to a normal backpropagation, but having opponent use (n_i - w_i) where n_i = num simulations and w_i = num wins
 xxd: use (n_i - w_i) in place of w_i

 xxd: this video suggests to immediately perform rollout if n_i == 0 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a> but in the baeldung link it instead always chooses to expand once it hits a leaf node
 xxd: i'm a bit confused which to do
 xxd: i'm gonna follow the video though
 XadeBlade: Hello, I'm not good at coding, so I need your help. Please tell me a really super duper easy  exercise that I could do to build my knollege. Also, what is the easiest code?
 xxd: am i supposed to create a new tree when my opponent makes their move? or "re-root" my tree at the current state, as in shifting the tree up one time
 Westicles: Hi XadeBlade.  As a first step I would recommend taking an IQ test.  You need to make sure you are above 120 or so to have any chance of success
 xxd: (my money is on the latter, since it's already computation thats been done)
 xxd: I completely forgot about draws when implementing my MCTS&#160;;-;
 xxd: wow my MCTS correctly chooses the middle square for tic tac toe hehe
 xxd: i wonder if i should incorporate symmetry into the tree branching or if that is too complicated
 xxd: wow my thing consistently plays optimally once i changed my exploration parameter from sqrt(2) to 2
 xxd: but this is just trivial tic tac toee
 xxd: curiously, it didnt work well when it was sqrt(2)
 xxd: hmm, not perfectly optimally but at least optimally for the first couple moves
 martinpapa69: faking ide run limit
 martinpapa69: so annoying
 xxd: man my MCTS is buggy but I have no clue how to debug itt
 martinpapa69: debugging an mcts is not easy at first. having a simple clean implementation helps
 xxd: this is my dilemma if you care to take a look <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ix.io/3vdN">http://ix.io/3vdN</a>
 xxd: it happens every time, so its oddly consistent
 xxd: i am wondering if anyone may have ideas why this might happen
 xxd: i am not sure how to penalize moves that would cause the opponent to win
 martinpapa69: return draw&#160;? 0&#160;: winner == actual_player&#160;? 1&#160;: -1
 xxd: what if its happening because theres only a one in 4 chance that the opponent plays that move
 martinpapa69: your algo will figure it out which one is the correct move if you implement it correctly
 martinpapa69: hmm if encode your players like {white: 1, black -1} you can actually int eval(){return actual_player * winner};
 martinpapa69: too clean
 xxd: eh its not that big of a deal
 xxd: i'm also doing it in python
 xxd: so its pretty readable and not very long

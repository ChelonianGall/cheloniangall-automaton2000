 sugam: why did i get 75%
 sugam: does that mean 75% of the test cases were correct?
 hypers: yes
 hypers: share the code
 hypers: we can spot the problem
 sugam: look
 sugam: ohhh
 sugam: I looped through all of it
 sugam: while I assigned i as int, and the n was long. I got an error for long values
 hypers: probably
 jacek: oh my
 sugam: guys do you have any tips for me to get remote internships? Companies at my countries are really bad and I think getting a remote internship Eu/US would be better for my growth. 
 jacek: youre magus reversed :o

 MACKEYTH: Anyone familiar with the Fall 2020 challenge referee?
 eulerscheZahl: the engine was simple enough to play the game without referee
 eulerscheZahl: can't you just skip the introduction and come to the real question?
 MACKEYTH: What's the behavior when casting a spell if you don't have inventory room for all the new ingredients?
 dbdr: hey eulerscheZahl!where did you get so many CPs? :D
 eulerscheZahl: hm..CG Funge, Search Race, Dots &amp; Boxes
 jacek: i can troll again :tada:

 eulerscheZahl: must be another game, my 25 is engraved in stone
 martinpapa69: oware
 Astrobytes: lol, time well spent eh :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Howdy there!
 martinpapa69: but...i still hope this gonna work
 eulerscheZahl: hail our mod
 BlaiseEbuth: Fear my badge.
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: is MK back to mod as well?
 BlaiseEbuth: Cg don't want me as mod, but the char disagree.
 BlaiseEbuth: *chat
 eulerscheZahl: did you know that chat and char differ by just one chat?
 eulerscheZahl: *char
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 jacek: so are you mod or not
 eulerscheZahl: the answer is "yes"
 BlaiseEbuth: I am \o/

 BUCKFAE: Is Skynet 1 only broken for me? I pass all tests in the IDE but get 0% in the final evaluation
 Ace1315: nyanharo
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: for C4, use smart rollouts (avoid losing moves, play winning moves).
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl: If you want to win, avoid losing.
 darkhorse64: stop plagiarism, please
 martinpapa69: can you link a paper about this algo? sounds interesting
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't mess with a moderator darkhorse64...
 darkhorse64: On the Huge Benefit of Decisive Moves in Monte-Carlo Tree Search Algorithms
 darkhorse64: I can kick moderators butt provided I stay polite
 darkhorse64: and I act gently
 BlaiseEbuth: blackponyx86
 darkhorse64: 32 bits is so 20th century
 BlaiseEbuth: Aren't you? :p
 jacek: mhm
 darkhorse64: don't mess with veterans
 BlaiseEbuth: :older_man:
 jacek: checking for win/lose moves... of course theres tradeoff. smarter rollouts, (a bit?) slower but better. must have in yavalath, meh in othello
 jacek: i bet euler has it&#160;:?
 darkhorse64: Yep, it's not a winning recipe but it works in C4. I based my recommandation on his C4 C# snippet
 TobiasA: are any of you in legend in tron?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah
 darkhorse64: I do
 darkhorse64: but far from the top
 TobiasA: did you use minimax?
 BlaiseEbuth: yup
 TobiasA: did you make every other player have negative score when simulating their moves?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes.
 BlaiseEbuth: 3 min, 1 max
 BlaiseEbuth: when 4 players
 TobiasA: and it worked fine?
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, my bot is 62th
 TobiasA: did it get you from gold to legend?
 TobiasA: or you used something else?
 BlaiseEbuth: I tunned it after the legend promotion, but that was already what I used in in gold.
 TobiasA: hm
 TobiasA: mine works but makes random dumb decisions sometimes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I survived Korn concert last night.  I think I lvld up in RL.&#160;;)
 TobiasA: and i don't know what the problem is
 BlaiseEbuth: This kind of algo depends a lot of your evaluation function...
 jrke: flood fill eval works great in tron
 TobiasA: that's what i used
 TobiasA: the bot is stuck in its current rank no matter how much i try to make it better
 Xaniouks: So close but yet so far in solving the puzzle of the week :sweat_smile:
 jrke: TobiasA your flood fill eval looks buggy i think
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/574543436">https://www.codingame.com/replay/574543436</a>
 jrke: turn 162
 jrke: bad move at turn 162
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 TobiasA: yea that's what i was talking about sometimes it works just fine then sometimes it just makes the most trash decision i have ever seen
 TobiasA: i think it was trying to block the red guy
 jrke: but see he is already blocked and blocking him more will lead you to block
 jrke: and i also think that move at turn 19 is also bad
 TobiasA: how do you think i should score the bots especially with more than two players because that's when it freak out the most?
 jrke: wait i have one link lemme see if i can find
 BlaiseEbuth: I have a flood fill, and it works fine. You should verify there's no error in your implementation.
 jrke: i have flood fill also but for better explanantion understand this

 TobiasA: yea that's exactly what i did
 jrke: but it looks buggy

 BUCKFAE: What do i do if a puzzle is broken?
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix it
 BUCKFAE: It's not my puzzle, how would i do that
 BUCKFAE: I get all tests correct in the ide yet my score is 0%
 BUCKFAE: when i submit
 jrke: validators!!
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, since the error is probably in your code, you totally can fix it.
 TobiasA: maybe you hard coded:astonished:
 BUCKFAE: I did not hardcode anything yet the validators don't work
 BlaiseEbuth: What puzzle&#160;?
 BUCKFAE: Skynet revolution - episode 1

 BUCKFAE: I know my bfs is bad, don't judge lol
 BUCKFAE: But this is not hard-coded
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks for reporting, I gonna send a message to the 37296 users who solved it, to tell them they can't have solved it since the validators don't work.
 BUCKFAE: There is a chance that the validators broke, or am i wrong?
 BlaiseEbuth: No chance.
 BUCKFAE: The validators are even the same thing as in the ide and they work in the ide (at least from what i can tell)
 jacek: welp it works for me
 jrke: its showing timeout in validators
 jacek: but yeah, using your solution it doesnt work in validations oO
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. Somebody have a python solution that already got 100%&#160;?
 BUCKFAE: Could it be the while True at the end? If the validators don't stop like the ide does i will loop forever there
 TobiasA: timeouts are the worst i prefer long irritating c++ errors than timeouts
 jacek: welp simple test in test and validator is the same
 BlaiseEbuth: They aren't
 BlaiseEbuth: Node ids are differents
 jacek: anyway something's weird. they fail right away
 BlaiseEbuth: Hard coding the first validator in python works for me.
 BlaiseEbuth: So the problem really come from your code
 Counterbalance: the s = sorted(..) looks problematic.It returns that, and then edges.remove() is called on that. If the elements are swapped, the edge won't be found. I think.
 BUCKFAE: oh crap, that's probably it
 BUCKFAE: i was assuming the edges are always sorted descending
 BUCKFAE: Thank you, that solved the issue. I added a test if the edge exists, otherwise i swap the tuple 
 jacek: oO
 Counterbalance: nice!

 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if i should avoid generating all child nodes at once before expanding them one after another (or not at all) at later times
 eulerscheZahl: it happens that I generate 3M nodes (and valid moves) but only ever use 450k
 eulerscheZahl: any experience from other players?
 Scarfield: which multi, and mcts? (no exp fiddling with it though, i always expand fully=
 jrke: what doe inline do btw?
 jrke: in c++
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/413ec14a-7598-4d2a-9d4a-2c5f1558535c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/413ec14a-7598-4d2a-9d4a-2c5f1558535c</a>
 darkhorse64: When expanding, I do a rollout for each child. Ofc, this is very bad for games with huge branching. When combined with a solver, smart rollouts, it simplifies code a bit
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: My bot went from 500 to 2.4k in CSB gold&#160;:( after I changed it
 Scarfield: i guess either rollout more than once (if you expand fully), to get an early approximation if the path is worth revisiting. Or only expanding one child and rollout once
 Scarfield: oh as the dark horse said&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Pale horses are better.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ;o
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Purple horses are best
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Automaton2000 what do you think
 Automaton2000: that's what i see in the ide
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Exactly
 TobiasA: is Automaton2000 a bot?:neutral_face:
 Automaton2000: how do you know what you're doing
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and see if i can get a new one
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: AutomatonNN
 jrke: yeah he is a chatbot
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ik
 jrke: it*
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: What happened to NN?
 TobiasA: reeeeaaaally?
 Astrobytes: Gone thankfully.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: .-.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Rip
 BlaiseEbuth: Not much purple horses here. Not enough brains to eat I suppose...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Not enough brains on CG?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Not enough brains anywhere then ._.
 TobiasA: how do i talk to the bot
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Just mention name
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: does anyone has a good bot
 TobiasA: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or at least that's what i did.
 Astrobytes: Or, preferably, don't.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ^
 TobiasA: hm i wonder why i didn't notice it was a bot all along
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: "Magus XMPP chat bot" it says
 TobiasA: well i never looked at that till now:rolling_eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: Let him do. I want to enjoy my mod privileges while I can. :smiling_imp:
 TobiasA: my fault
 TobiasA: i don't want to get banned:sleepy:
 eulerscheZahl: Scarfield 06:54PMwhich multi, and mcts? (no exp fiddling with it though, i always expand fully=
 eulerscheZahl: "When expanding, I do a rollout for each child."but that requires further child expansion down the tree. doesn't this result in a fully evaluated game tree?
 eulerscheZahl: "Gone thankfully."I won't miss AutomatonNN either&#160;:)
 TobiasA: why?
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl is there a way you miss AutomatonNN one day?
 jrke: finally i gathered my will to rewrite my CSB bot
 jrke: i will be trying smitsimax this time maybe
 TobiasA: what is your rank?
 jrke: TobiasA my rank in CSB?
 TobiasA: yup
 jrke: 43 currently
 eulerscheZahl: if it gets revived and the next loss of it means that the whole CodinGame website died. then yes, I would miss AutomatonNN (or at least the other things I lost with it)
 TobiasA: damn
 eulerscheZahl: is that just the inoryy bot with a few lines of eval?
 jrke: nah
 jrke: my own but its quite messy code now
 TobiasA: what algorithm did you use at first jrke?
 4DsErfan: where's the ordak
 eulerscheZahl: i tried hard on mean max. and a bit on poker chip race. that's enough physics for me.
 ShakeDatBunda: how do I approve or reject a contribution?
 jrke: simulation with that seed one shifting a move for each turn 
 eulerscheZahl: click the button that says approve
 jrke: if its not WIP
 eulerscheZahl: then click the checkboxes for the moderation questions (after reading them)
 eulerscheZahl: you need 50 clashes for a clash contribution and level 20+ for the rest
 Astrobytes: jrke: I think he meant which algo did you use for CSB at first
 jrke: at first means the first time or the current submitted one?
 Astrobytes: When you started using a search bot for CSB
 TobiasA: before deciding to rewrite
 eulerscheZahl: the first thing I did at CSB was setting the speed to max (100)
 eulerscheZahl: then I promoted
 eulerscheZahl: oh and going to (x, y) instead of (y, y)
 Astrobytes: *search bot
 eulerscheZahl: then the angle part came into play and I left the game for some months
 jrke: for first search bot i used bugged engine with MC random search
 eulerscheZahl: didn't see a proper definition of what the angle even means
 jrke: then i removed bugs and optimizing it
 TobiasA: did you guys simulate opponent moves
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 jrke: yes

 michaellan: Yeah, I haven't tried to perform combos, maybe that will do it
 michaellan: WOW
 eulerscheZahl: that's pretty bad actually
 michaellan: i have no clue how you code it to build up for a combo like that&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: it's just a random search
 eulerscheZahl: random moves until either all zombies or all humans are dead
 eulerscheZahl: try over and over again, keep the best
 michaellan: like GA?
 TobiasA: MC
 eulerscheZahl: mine is just a monte carlo. fully random each time
 eulerscheZahl: but there are better ways
 michaellan: how does the rollout work though
 eulerscheZahl: read the link that YurkovAS provided
 michaellan: gotcha
 eulerscheZahl: in the end you have to reimplement how the game works
 michaellan: like the zombie aggro right
 eulerscheZahl: ash moves, zombies react. ash moves again and so on
 martinpapa69: why is my locally compliled code like 30% faster, than the one i let CG  compile it&#160;:( i have a lot of pragmas
 blazejek123: t.if
 reCurse: Different hardware
 martinpapa69: cg hardware. i complile the code, encode it and send it. then save and run
 reCurse: If you're using native architecture pragma it's possible it enables more optimizations for your machine that wouldn't work on cg
 martinpapa69: both my codes run on cg server
 martinpapa69: so...its working on cg server
 reCurse: Oh for some reason I understood the other way around
 reCurse: Not sure why
 martinpapa69: one thing i noticed my asserts even pop when i set #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
 martinpapa69: so it looks like a fake o3 to me
 michaellan: it is okay for me to close the popup when i click "Test in Arena" right? it will still run all the necessary battles behind the scenes?
 martinpapa69: yes
 Westicles: Different versions of  g++?  Or maybe locally you are using clang++. that is usually faster?
 reCurse: If asserts pop then it looks like you didn't undef _GLIBCXX_DEBUG
 martinpapa69: hm thx, I thought o3 would remove them
 reCurse: Pragma doesn't change the command line
 reCurse: It only changes what it still can
 reCurse: Compiler is still invoked with O0 so it does some stuff like define macros
 martinpapa69: hm I just tried, Ofast, its actually much...faster
 reCurse: It enables a lot of unsafe behavior so be careful
 Astrobytes: Yeah, sometimes it's worth just turning on the parts you need individually rather than the full Ofast
 martinpapa69: still better than precompiling
 reCurse: shrug
 3283415: \o/
 reCurse: mcts is so fickle it drives me nuts
 michaellan: is it easier to code geneetic algorithm or MC for CVZ?
 martinpapa69: mc. its like 10 lines max
 michaellan: joking?
 Astrobytes: Random move, update state, increase depth. Score as you go with a depth malus or just score at the end.
 Astrobytes: As long as your sim is correct you should get relatively reasonable results
 Astrobytes: Oh it's CvZ, you should be fine just going with end score
 martinpapa69: ok i lied
 martinpapa69: 20 lines

 FalINTOblivion0112: everyone is so encouraging, i like this environment
 michaellan: is it viable to write MCTS in python or should i switch to C++
 ZarthaxX: it will be very slow in python
 Astrobytes: For testing purposes sure, but not for a performant bot
 ZarthaxX: you wont get good results in the long run
 ZarthaxX: well, what astro said&#160;:)
 michaellan: thanks guys. my prorotype was in python but now i'll try re-writing it in C++
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxXamang how are ya dude
 ZarthaxX: good
 michaellan: also, one quick question about backpropagation
 ZarthaxX: but just do a simpel version xxd, without optimizing
 ZarthaxX: remember, make it work first, then optimize
 michaellan: in many of the tutorials I see that wins are backpropagated like +1 to all parents
 ZarthaxX: and always check after each optimization that you didnt break anything
 michaellan: but wont this bias the MCTS towards choosing dumb moves for the opponent? what I did was I did +1 if the winner of the rollout == the state's players move
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, going to c++ from python is already a huge optimization...
 TobiasA: when you guys use bitboards in c++ do you use bitset or some other method?
 michaellan: so it basically only adds +1 at skipping every other level
 michaellan: effectively
 darkhorse64: :scream:
 ZarthaxX: i dont get your question xxd
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth ye :P
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA use a 64bits variable
 Astrobytes: uint64_t
 ZarthaxX: bitset is good for debuggintg tho

 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX&#160;:*
 KiwiTae: o/ Astrobytes
 TobiasA: i should have asked earlier
 TobiasA: i have to start everything again
 michaellan: mostly concerned about the part where I only add 1 if the winner of the rollout is actually the player moving
 ZarthaxX: you hardcoded the 1 xxd
 michaellan: oh is that wrong too
 ZarthaxX: it could be 0 if its a draw, but forget about it :P
 michaellan: yeah w is None on a draw&#160;:)

 ZarthaxX: so the next parent gets the opposite
 darkhorse64: when backpropagating the result of a rollout, +1 if it's a win for the player that plays the move in the current state, -1 otherwise
 ZarthaxX: it's basically what you are doing in the other code
 michaellan: so basically the strongest opponent moves are selected
 ZarthaxX: but without ifs
 ZarthaxX: wdym?
 michaellan: thanks thanks thanks
 michaellan: i mean like if you just add 1 at every stage, you will select for the "weakest" opponent moves instead of the strongest
 ZarthaxX: you are just adding on each node the game result based on that node perspective
 michaellan: i think
 michaellan: yeah i get it now intuitively, thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: Tank tank tank - Guderian
 ZarthaxX: you are just colleting data when doing mcts, like some stadistic method
 michaellan: sadistic&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 LelouchVC2: Its always a nice surprise to see that I've been unbanned from world chat
 reCurse: Thanks for pointing out, fixed
 BlaiseEbuth: Monster...
 Astrobytes: That one STILL hangs around?
 michaellan: damn, what did he do
 BlaiseEbuth: Waiting for any chat crash, ready to come back!
 BlaiseEbuth: He never wait long though
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX sorry bout the exam, take care in the storm dude
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes thanks, i hate that subject exam&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: didnt leave yet as the storm is not so bad yet haha
 Astrobytes: ah cool
 Astrobytes: What subject?
 ZarthaxX: language paradigms
 Astrobytes: KiwiTae: hey hey&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't go to run outside with your arms raised, and that's gonna be fine.
 Westicles: xxd, looks like he made a south park reference
 ZarthaxX: i wanted to do it asap to be free tho, so it's not good news
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: BO-RING&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: but the maximum amount of people for the exam was 4
 ZarthaxX: pretty lame
 Astrobytes: Ah damn.
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: will give another shot on september :P
 ZarthaxX: and yes, super boring
 ZarthaxX: on the other hand, there is going to be a subject called game theory this semester
 ZarthaxX: looking up for it
 Astrobytes: You'll pass no problem when you do it.Oho game theory eh&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: i hope i do, trying to do the exam with the easy teacher...
 ZarthaxX: there is like the ying yang teacher here lmao
 ZarthaxX: the other dude just destroys you
 Astrobytes: Same everywhere man
 ZarthaxX: i know but this one iseven worse
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX patpat
 TobiasA: i can't find a good place to learn the 64 bit variable thing 
 ZarthaxX: patpat? :P
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA wdym?
 Astrobytes: He's patting you on the head to comfort you ZarthaxX
 BlaiseEbuth: Emperor patpatin
 TobiasA: like a website
 ZarthaxX: you just use the bits of the binary representation of an integer variable as a bitset
 PatrickMcGinnisII: uh oh
 Astrobytes: TobiasA: are you familiar with bit manipulation?
 TobiasA: yea
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA maybe you will enjoy this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf</a>
 Astrobytes: So there is nothing different, you are just operating on a 64 bit type is all
 TobiasA: i just came from there :grin:
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not a website! That's a f**** pdf!
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes oh okey :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: thanks kiwo&#160;:*
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA huh, didnt work out for you?
 ZarthaxX: also this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/General_Setwise_Operations">https://www.chessprogramming.org/General_Setwise_Operations</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a website
 Westicles: Pat, you have to fight for your honor
 ZarthaxX: lmao BlaiseEbuth
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA search for bitboard, maybe that yields better results
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: The emperor's patpating anakin
 TobiasA: i know how to use bitboards but i don't know how to use the 64 bit variable one
 TobiasA: i only know how to use bitset
 ZarthaxX: so
 BlaiseEbuth: So you don't know
 ZarthaxX: you just need to learn how to make the bitset operations witha  variable
 ZarthaxX: integer one
 TobiasA: yea where do i learn it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff945d51-f523-414e-8fb2-aafbbd20c0c8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff945d51-f523-414e-8fb2-aafbbd20c0c8</a>
 Westicles: reCurse: There are only two things I can't stand in this world. People who are intolerant of other people's code. And PHP programmers. 
 ZarthaxX: for example, to set a bit to 1 with bitset:value[i] = 1with variable:value = value | (1 &lt;&lt; i)
 Astrobytes: You pulled that one up quick 
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't try humor, he gonna ban you Westicles! :scream:
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA you can just look at the bitwise operations available
 TobiasA: how do i set the size?
 ZarthaxX: you just need or, xor, and and negation for now
 Astrobytes: value |= (1 &lt;&lt; i)
 ZarthaxX: you cant
 TobiasA: :0
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes didnt want to confuse him
 ZarthaxX: :P
 reCurse: Blaise it's getting old
 Astrobytes: UglycodethaxX
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA you operate with a variable that has a fixed amount of bits
 TobiasA: what if i want 600 bits
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope, that's just always true... Sadly
 ZarthaxX: it can be 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits
 TobiasA: i have to write 600 zero's
 ZarthaxX: TobiasA ah you need an array of integers
 reCurse: Why don't you just ignore me and save us both some time
 ZarthaxX: that just gets complicated :P
 reCurse: So obnoxious
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes dude i wanted to be cleaaaaarrr
 FalINTOblivion0112: i am about to pass the top 1000 clash of code mark
 FalINTOblivion0112: this is gonna be historic
 ZarthaxX: i got a 10/10 in software design subject this semester, in your face astrolameius
 ZarthaxX: :P
 KiwiTae: FalINTOblivion0112 playd 1000games? or top 1000?
 FalINTOblivion0112: top 100
 FalINTOblivion0112: top 1000
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: I defer to you good sir :D
 xxd: you use bit shifting to "index" with a mask
 TobiasA: thanks for the help ZarthaxX

 Astrobytes: :kissing_heart: ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: that's a start
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. You're the one who come to yawn after me when I spoke earlier reCurse. I'm not pinging you... :roling_eyes:
 Westicles: 10/10?  What is that, some hippie grading scale?
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: love you my astroboi
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and write a function to print your bits out so you can double check your results
 ZarthaxX: Westicles our marks go from 0 to 10
 Astrobytes: It's mostly quite intuitive TobiasA but it can get a little tricky 
 ZarthaxX: ah astroadviser
 ZarthaxX: good one
 xxd: astroconsultant
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 reCurse: You really don't know when to drop it
 Westicles: Huh.  Just shoot for a 4 and it will look great on a resume
 ZarthaxX: Westicles yeah that's the minimum mark to pass :P
 Westicles: My university had a 5 point scale.  A plot of med school admissions vs GPA had this spike around 4
 ZarthaxX: oh interesting :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: so strange that there isnt a standarized way
 xxd: in the US at least many schools use 4.0
 xxd: but many codingamers seem to be from europe
 xxd: or other... assorted places
 FalINTOblivion0112: you guys are already in university?
 FalINTOblivion0112: im only in junior high lmao xd
 xxd: that explains your username
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 ZarthaxX: FalINTOblivion0112 people here are in all possible stages
 ZarthaxX: school, uni, finished uni
 FalINTOblivion0112: i know
 ZarthaxX: :P
 FalINTOblivion0112: im just suprised
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you, reCurse?On this interesting question, I go to sleep. Kisses everyone!
 darkhorse64: even finished for a very long time uni
 michaellan: even in hell
 TobiasA: jeez
 michaellan: does C++ get boost on codingame server compilation?
 michaellan: boost as in the library
 darkhorse64: No
 michaellan: aw shucks
 michaellan: Is it not recommended to use iostream
 darkhorse64: for input/output&#160;? iostream is OK
 michaellan: i think i heard someone say it was slower than cstdio
 michaellan: i'll just use cstdio
 darkhorse64: I have heard that too but it's OK for use on CG
 darkhorse64: I mean, it's not like we need a lot of I/O
 michaellan: that's true
 Westicles: It is better to be cool than fast.  Things like bitboards lack panache
 darkhorse64: :rolling_eyes:
 Astrobytes: there might be some performance benefit from printf vs std::cout but I think it's negligible
 michaellan: should i do anything about the fact, that for example in Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect 4, that many differnet nodes will have the exact same state? should I somehow have them point to a singular copy of the state or have them be duplicated throughout the tree
 darkhorse64: I leave them duplicated and do not try to deal with transpositions
 TobiasA: now i am wondering why exactly shouldn't i use bitset?:thinking:
 michaellan: do you guys like to store the state of the player who (1) just went; or (2) is about to go, in your MCTS state
 Astrobytes: It's a little bit slower since you're using std 
 darkhorse64: (1)
 Astrobytes: Feel free to use it to get used to stuff and check your manual operations
 Astrobytes: (1)
 darkhorse64: I do not think you can use pdep/pext/avx with bitsets
 TobiasA: is the (0, 0) coordinate of the grid in tron top left or bottom left?
 darkhorse64: CG likes top left as origin
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: No but he's trying to get used to just bit manip in general so he may be a little far off from that stuff rn&#160;;)
 TobiasA: when i use bitset coordinates are mirrored on the x-axis
 Astrobytes: You're trying to bitboard Tron?
 TobiasA: i used to get to gold
 TobiasA: but it doesnt work anymore
 Astrobytes: You may be overthinking a little
 TobiasA: and i don't understand what is going on
 Astrobytes: sorry, distracted, watching Daze Between festical
 Astrobytes: *festival
 TobiasA: will it be fast enough if i used just vector
 Astrobytes: I don't know what you are doing, what you're using bitsets for or anything
 TobiasA: in tron
 TobiasA: to represent the grid
 TobiasA: the state
 TobiasA: whatever they call it
 TobiasA: so i should use vector or no?
 Astrobytes: Whatever is easiest. Straightup array is fine, vector is fine.
 FalINTOblivion0112: YES

 darkhorse64: Please no. Just make a good one
 Astrobytes: How to attract haters on CG: Part 3
 FalINTOblivion0112: YES
 FalINTOblivion0112: such a good idea
 FalINTOblivion0112: i will make that
 FalINTOblivion0112: in fact
 AllYourTrees: has anyone heard of the game Tak from the kingkiller chronicle by rothfuss?
 Astrobytes: (Reasons to be cheerful Part 3 - Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads in case anyone wondered the reference)
 Astrobytes: AllYourTrees: It exists irl now it seems? I know nothing about it
 AllYourTrees: yeah they made it real, ive never played it though
 AllYourTrees: i don't really know much about it either lol, read the books though so thoguht it was cool that they made it
 Astrobytes: Well, you could do 3D chess à la TNG too
 AllYourTrees: whats tng?
 Astrobytes: Star Trek: The Next Generation
 AllYourTrees: oooooh
 <b>**Astrobytes is not ashamed</b></p><p><img src="/a/35047123145003" /> AllYourTrees: hmm chess too hard, what about 3 d tic tac toe? you could call it... TTTT
 Astrobytes: reCurse: please intervene
 Astrobytes: hehe, no.
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: a 3d game would be cool though
 AllYourTrees: i like that idea
 Astrobytes: There are a couple no?
 Astrobytes: Dice Duels

 Yuri123: Hi guys
 Yuri123: Anyone got problem with Chess board analyzer? i can explain what issue i've got so i use C# and even my program is passing all test at the end when i submit my solution he complains about one test and says that's for avoiding hard coding solution but i don't have any hard coding solution, anyone can help me for that?
 Yuri123: So i can't have 100% i'm stuck at 93%
 Westicles: which validator?
 Yuri123: Escape by overtaking
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41116fed-5c4a-4d53-966d-6fad7e41033e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41116fed-5c4a-4d53-966d-6fad7e41033e</a>
 Westicles: Output: N
 Yuri123: bro i know
 Yuri123: i said it works 
 Yuri123: the test doesnt fail
 Yuri123: i mean when i submit all my solution it complains about this test
 Yuri123: after having say it pass
 Yuri123: so all my test pass no problem at that moment
 Westicles: validators are different than tests
 Yuri123: but when i SUBMIT
 Yuri123: it complains
 Westicles: you need to figure out why your code fails with the validator I pasted
 Yuri123: it doesnt fail omg do u understand english?
 Westicles: You aren't listening, 'bro'
 Westicles: Good luck and gfy
 Manjius: kek
 michaellan: do u understand english even bro
 Manjius: validators are test+hidden tests u cant see
 Manjius: wait i mean, when u submit
 Manjius: welp
 michaellan: is it possible to have a global RNG generator in C++
 michaellan: These are the first lines of my file, and this doesnt work: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ix.io/3vpN">http://ix.io/3vpN</a>
 michaellan: ah, i use .discard() in main it seems
 michaellan: nope thats not it
 michaellan: ... why is random numbers in C++ so complicated
 IISadNightII: Vamos a hacerlo&#160;:) 
 michaellan: I'm not sure if I'm using shared_ptr correctly cuz none of my nodes are getting updated
 michaellan: oh it probably has to do with going out-of-scope and deleting
 Yuri123: Finally i found the solution fucking chess analyzer
 Yuri123: how can i know hidden test lmao
 Yuri123: we should know all test even hidden ones
 Yuri123:&#160;???
 clashofcodeisbad: if you know all test cases anyone can just hardcorde the answer..
 Yuri123: yea i know that but even without hard coded the solution some test required "special indication" that aren't explained but are verified on hidden test
 Yuri123: i mean on all test that i passed none of them verify if the king can actually attack another piece of chess
 Yuri123: but this thing was actually verified on hidden test
 Yuri123: so all my test passed but fail on hidden test after submitting the solution
 Yuri123: doesn't make any sense for me
 Yuri123: also no indication of WHY it fails
 juice0: after almost 2 hours of complaining about it, i still don't understand what exactly the problem is.  but somehow you have a problem with less than perfect information?
 Yuri123: i can send u my solution and u will see what i'm talking about if u want?
 juice0: that's not going to help either of us
 Yuri123: u will see that my solution pass but at the end it complains about hard coded solution which wasn't the case but another thing was the real problem
 Yuri123: on the hidden test it verify another thing that actual tests don't
 Yuri123: codingame is not perfect 
 Yuri123: that's what i've learn
 juice0: gotcha.  yep i did a puzzle and it passed the tests but didn't get 100%.  i learned a similar lesson.  my next lesson should be to stay out of general chat while i'm trying to be better than 0% at the current task...
 Yuri123: hahaha
 Yuri123: good luck my friend i gtg have a good night cya
 Wontonimo: the hidden tests (validation) are supposed to be different than the visible tests.  The tests are just to help you get on the right track and give a bit of feedback.  The validators are to see if your solved it.
 Yuri123: yea but how can we know what it expect from us?
 Yuri123: that's the question
 Yuri123: if it randomly fails without saying anything to guide u
 Wontonimo: welcome to data science
 Yuri123: give me the keys i will launch the debugger of Codingame directly on the web host XDDDD
 Wontonimo: this is part of science and testing in general.  There are things you know, so you come up with a theory
 Wontonimo: and then you test that theory on new data
 Wontonimo: that's just basic science.
 Wontonimo: if i show you how to add numbers from 1 to 20 except the 12's.  I can test your understanding of addition by asking you the 12's
 Wontonimo: if your response is "you didn't show me the 12s yet" then you don't understand addition
 Wontonimo: you only memorized
 Wontonimo: same thing
 Wontonimo: as the validation
 Yuri123: well u can't apply that for all data science cuz some got infinit rules
 Yuri123: u will reach 100 years old without finishing it
 Yuri123: lol
 Yuri123: also as a programmer u are depending of ur technology and time and expectation and safety but can't predict all the cases cuz some can come from unpredicted sources that's why game devs are in front against bugs
 Yuri123: at high level nothing is perfect
 Yuri123: u have to admit it
 Wontonimo: what coding challenge was it that you were working in?
 Yuri123: im asp.net developper
 Yuri123: i'm creating web app
 reCurse: It's your job to predict all cases to the best of your ability
 Wontonimo: +1
 TheDoomedLongcoat_ddf8: is this page for gud coder or begginer can understadn as well?
 Yuri123: yea at the end u can't predict all
 Wontonimo: hey UCHIHASHISUI, how beginner?
 Yuri123: simple exemple if someone come with a modified linux core and browsers that's a thing u will never think about
 Yuri123: and ur web app is fucked up
 TheDoomedLongcoat_ddf8: as in basic, like understanding def function or module stuff, does this website highlight this? or it expect me o already know?
 Yuri123: nah here i'm coming just to play with some exercises

 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: there is starting code

 hoangjunokatte: hi
 hoangjunokatte: hi
 Wontonimo: hi hi
 hoangjunokatte: vietnamese and you
 Wontonimo: for that game, a first good control system would be to not aim for the checkpoint, but instead aim for the checkpoint - velocity

 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: you got any test cases?
 michaellan: like this is the output for the first move of tic tac toe
 michaellan: the square at the bottom is the chosen square
 michaellan: but like that first square is just broken AF
 michaellan: oops i never sent link
 Wontonimo: what kind of probabilities/scores is it outputting for each move?
 michaellan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ix.io/3vqi">http://ix.io/3vqi</a>
 michaellan: here is pastebin
 michaellan: not sure if you're willing to read my code or not.. that is a big ask
 michaellan: i'd appreciate any areas which might be causing this bug, any suspicions u might have
 Wontonimo: yeah sure, i could have a look.  sent me a PM
 Wontonimo: from the probabilities, it looks like it may be that the backprop isn't updating the node that the backprop starts on, or the UCB calc is wrong

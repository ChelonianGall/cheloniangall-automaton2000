 xxd: oof, it doesnt work on Cross
 xxd: fixed^
 xxd: is it possible to do Mars Lander with MC, or must it be done with GA?
 Uljahn: it's possible to do Mars Lander with plain PID
 KiwiTae: i did ml3 with simple pid without checking the physics
 xxd: wow
 xxd: 100%?
 KiwiTae: yes but didnt get the extra achievment yet 
 xxd: I need to read up on PID
 xxd: the extent of my knowledge about PID controllers right now is "-3v == good" :joy:
 KiwiTae: i lend one test with 0fuel lol
 xxd: at least you pass it&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: yea hehe
 ProCoder03: @wontonimo usually keeps on saying to use 25v in Mars lander 2

 JLasfdgh: ii
 xxd: wholesome fishbot
 eulerscheZahl: somehow that puzzle never got released
 eulerscheZahl: wouldn't be a good optim (your fish can only go up and down while always moving 1 to the right)
 eulerscheZahl: but the optimal solution can be found with some dynamic programming, would do an okay puzzle
 xxd: ah
 xxd: is there an obvious reason im unaware of why poker variants arent a game on codingame?
 xxd: is it the luck aspect
 xxd: or maybe the trolling aspect i guess, which would prevent any sort of betting games from being viable
 eulerscheZahl: probably that and that no one bothered creating such a game
 eulerscheZahl: but i wouldn't be happy if someone did
 xxd: why?
 eulerscheZahl: because of the luck aspect you mentioned
 eulerscheZahl: it might be fun to play for humans (for some at least). but those bot fights should have a clear hierarchy of who's best
 eulerscheZahl: there is some rock-paper-scissors going on. but not completely random
 xxd: yeah true
 xxd: are you a university student?
 eulerscheZahl: i graduated as a Master in 2018
 xxd: oh nice
 eulerscheZahl: afk for breakfast
 xxd: how popular is simulated annealing? Haven't seen it mentioned much. GA seems a lot more talked about
 eulerscheZahl: here on CG it's not that popular. On Topcoder it's pretty common
 eulerscheZahl: Topcoder organizes optimization contests regularly

 eulerscheZahl: the "only" on the other hand does not
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not hiring, i'm employed myself.it's unlikely that you'll find a job here on this chat. Just as a hint: your main selling point should be your skills, not your low salary&#160;;)

 Pi3.14: okay thanks for the suggestions eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: well, becoming a programmer and those puzzle sites are 2 different things. they are both about coding
 eulerscheZahl: but for the puzzles you just rush something to get a green checkmark
 eulerscheZahl: professional work is more about readable code that you can extend at a later point. using design patterns that other developers can understand
 jacek: so is agile programming
 eulerscheZahl: using common frameworks and not just the language itself
 Pi3.14: Noted, thank you.&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: how to add elements to certain index in a empty list in py&#160;???

 GroutchKeu: wait you mean professional developers aren't professional copy/pasters?
 GroutchKeu: damn&#160;:|
 reCurse: Maybe in the clownish dev shops
 eulerscheZahl: there's a difference between taking that one algo or library that does the job for you and paying that guy on fiverr to do your job and then ask for a raise
 juice0: there's also a difference between using someone else's work and pretending it's your own
 reCurse: Though I did hear of a somewhat similar practice of outsourcers further outsourcing their work to cheaper devs
 eulerscheZahl: he already did that with his profile pic, claiming it was his own work
 eulerscheZahl: turned out he cropped it on his own
 reCurse: Oh yeah
 reCurse: That's true actually
 reCurse: What a clown
 juice0: i might just be way on my side of the fence though.  hell i put acknowledgements to people whose forum posts helped me out on euler's sokoban puzzle (IIRC)
 juice0: in comments
 reCurse: That's nice
 BlaiseEbuth: Was the code that he copied known to be available somewhere? Or did the other guy shared it with him only?
 reCurse: I think euler memorized all CG bots posted on github
 xxd: aw thats disappointing to hearr
 TobiasA: i always new swyfti was sus:joy:
 TobiasA: knew
 TobiasA: :expressionless:
 xxd: hes only in junior high, something was sus :thinking:
 reCurse: It's not about school it's about behavior
 TobiasA: it was just too fast
 xxd: yeah forget what i said
 reCurse: Those clowns all follow the same pattern
 reCurse: Insecure to the core
 reCurse: Anyway
 TobiasA: in two days or so he reached legend
 xxd: i reached legend sorta fast for UTTT
 xxd: but 
 xxd: i did get some help
 TobiasA: i guess i am just slow
 xxd: no
 MiyamuraIzumi: nice
 xxd: i gott lucky
 MiyamuraIzumi: I still in bronze on UTTT
 reCurse: To be fair uttt is relatively simple to get legend on
 TobiasA: how does one even represent the board for uttt
 reCurse: Some will disagree with me I'm sure
 xxd: also MiyamuraIzumi: your CvZ is still ~200 places higher thtan mine
 xxd: i have 209k points on it right 
 xxd: now
 reCurse: But the fact you just need to code a vanilla search algorithm with no heuristic needed and just basic optimization gets you there
 reCurse: Can't say that for a lot of multis
 xxd: but i did manage to get it working yesterday
 xxd: yeah
 xxd: im not sure why you hate it so much according to astrobytes
 MiyamuraIzumi: too fast
 xxd: is it because of its simplicity?
 reCurse: It's a terrible game
 xxd:&#160;:(
 Rob022: code in binary like a pro
 reCurse: It's completely obtuse to read
 xxd: true
 reCurse: It's unbalanced to hell and beyond
 reCurse: It's not fun to watch
 MiyamuraIzumi: it took me serveral weeks for cvz
 xxd: how many playouts per turn MiyamuraIzumi
 xxd: I'm only getting around 15k I think
 xxd: more towards the end though but still
 eulerscheZahl:  BlaiseEbuth i just got suspicious by his fast climb (took much much longer to reach legend)so i compared with the bot of a well known cheater
 reCurse: On a more serious note did anyone get around to try thompson sampling with mcts?
 MiyamuraIzumi: don't remember
 MiyamuraIzumi: more than 100k
 xxd: wow
 xxd: C++?
 MiyamuraIzumi: C
 TobiasA: i've never used MCTS in my life
 xxd: wow
 TobiasA: i'm scared
 xxd: its so fun when it works
 MiyamuraIzumi: I just thought that C is faster than c+
 xxd: yeah i think it is a bit faster but theres not ergonomic semantics
 TobiasA: but what if it doesn't work
 eulerscheZahl: "To be fair uttt is relatively simple to get legend on"for me personally UTTT and Wondev Woman were the hardest legends of all
 xxd: well u just gotta pour more hours into making it work
 TobiasA: debugging those stuff doesn't sound nice
 reCurse: I can see for WW but UTTT I super disagree
 reCurse: Vanilla mcts and basic optimization that's all you need
 reCurse: No brain needed
 xxd:&#160;:/
 reCurse: Just code the spec
 eulerscheZahl: i'm terrible at writing fast code
 xxd: yeah the simulation is easy and easy to bitboard too
 xxd: wait. reCurse what do you mean exactly by basic optimization
 reCurse: Basic knowledge of what makes code fast or slow
 juice0: my pride in my uTTT bot that looks 4 moves ahead is quickly shrinking
 eulerscheZahl: and I recently realized i had a major misunderstanding in MCTS. I used the rollout count of the root instead of direct parent node
 reCurse: You need both in uct
 michaellan: what?
 michaellan: isnt it just parentt
 reCurse: sqrt(log(parent)/child)
 reCurse: From memory
 michaellan: yeah there's no root in there
 michaellan: i think he meant like the actual root of the tree
 eulerscheZahl: and i did something with root and child
 michaellan: i hate how once we start using these cool algorithms and approaches, they always involve simulation :joy:
 michaellan: simulation is sometimes so painful to write ,and get right and not buggy
 reCurse: So... just like code?
 michaellan: true 
 michaellan: i'm gonna learn GA next
 reCurse: Do it for the knowledge
 reCurse: But don't spend too much time on it
 reCurse: A lot of it I find convoluted and unnecessary imo
 michaellan: oh, was gonna do Mars Lander optim with GA
 michaellan: someone yesterday saaid PID controllers alone was enough
 reCurse: You can basically boil it down to "try random solutions, keep the best and only partially randomize those afterwards"
 michaellan: like MC but with some sort of pruning?
 michaellan: and crossover
 reCurse: Once they start talking about chromosomes and crossover and all that you can close the tab
 michaellan: hah
 TobiasA: :laughing:
 michaellan: maybe i'll learn and use simulated annealing for ML optim then
 reCurse: That's a better investment
 michaellan: my dad keeps telling me about it, i think he likes it
 michaellan: awesome
 TobiasA: cool dad
 Porsuk: do we always make the first move in UTTT on the top left board?
 reCurse: Dead center
 michaellan: my MCTS tells me center (4, 4)
 Porsuk: IDE acts that way but it's not written in the rules
 Porsuk: dead center?
 michaellan: dead center is the coordinates 4 4
 michaellan: i have some utility functiions to help with conversion if you're using bitboarding
 michaellan: i think reCurse said that would be rated an easy puzzle, but still
 reCurse: A lot of people think my opinions are misguided so take that with a grain of salt :P
 SabertheLost: Stupid random tick tack toe algo still not good enough to beat broze boss&#160;;) 
 michaellan: lol
 michaellan: my random.choice(available_moves) got me into bronze
 SabertheLost: 29.91 in ranking comapred to bromze boss 31.63.Ok it not total random. Only placement that will make me win or lose are chocen at random. 
 michaellan: why would you choose a placement that will make you lose
 michaellan: wait you're already in bronze?
 SabertheLost: I do not do it. (aka so it nort part of the list of random placements9
 michaellan: i suggest you learn MCTS now
 michaellan: it will skyrocket you 
 michaellan: and you will have the biggest dopamine rush of your life
 TobiasA: to what league?
 michaellan: or at least i did
 michaellan: to legend 
 SabertheLost: Yeah I know I should take the leap.
 TobiasA: hm
 TobiasA: all the way from bronze?
 michaellan: i had to make some speed optimizations
 michaellan: well yeah i was in bronze
 TobiasA: damn then MCTS is probably very difficult
 TobiasA: if it is that effective
 michaellan: it depends how many bugs you run into IMO
 michaellan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a>
 michaellan: i dont know what the pros think of this video but i think its good
 reCurse: It's actually easy but a lot of explanations are not that great
 michaellan: reCurse: have you seen the video i listed above?
 TobiasA: i've seen that video
 michaellan: I think the only part thats wrong is he doesnt alternate win/loss propagation going up to the root
 michaellan: or he might've and i missed it
 TobiasA: the scary part is trying to implement it
 reCurse: It's not wrong
 michaellan: oh
 reCurse: MCTS is applicable to a much broader range than adversarial games
 reCurse: So it's not a given
 michaellan: ah
 reCurse: You could do it to optimize cvz for example
 reCurse: Then there's no alternate propagation
 michaellan: yeah understood
 michaellan: silly mee
 SabertheLost: each time I start reading the MCTS is  sooo many constants that I do understand the sentences they make.
 michaellan: i wonder what the legend certification task is for the Optimization quest track
 michaellan: there is not that many constants?
 SabertheLost: do not *
 reCurse: I think starting with a basic multi-armed bandit example would do a lot of good in understanding mcts afterwards
 reCurse: Because it's basically just adding a tree
 TobiasA: is that a puzzle?
 SabertheLost: @reCurese I cannot find the multi-armed banit in the associated traning puzzels under Monte carlo
 michaellan: if you have slot machines with different payout rates that you dont know, how do you maximize your winnings
 reCurse: You have to look outside Codingame
 TobiasA: oh
 michaellan: you need to exploit the current slot machines with good payouts but you also need to explore the others occasionally
 TobiasA: RL stuff yea?
 reCurse: Not necessarily but yes
 michaellan: apparently MCTS is not RL. I still dont know what countsa nd what doesnt
 reCurse: I don't see how it's not in some ways
 michaellan: yeah im not sure, eulerscheZahl just said it wasnt when i asked
 reCurse: Maybe because it's typically viewed as learning offline
 reCurse: But MCTS is a case for learning online
 michaellan: oh i see
 michaellan: so generally RL is an approach where you end up with those magical weights right
 reCurse: No that's the thing it's much broader than that
 michaellan: o
 michaellan: anyway sounds like i have a lot of reading to do
 reCurse: Semantics can get pretty confusing and I won't pretend I get those perfectly either
 reCurse: Broadly speaking reinforcement learning is just training a behavior by reinforcement through rewards following actions taken
 reCurse: The reason mcts qualifies is you train a policy or the action taken through simulated actions in the environment and getting the win/loss reward
 reCurse: Generally though you mean it's learning to generalize to most scenarios whereas mcts only trains on a specific scenario
 michaellan: hmm i dont get what you mean by that last part
 michaellan: OH
 michaellan: like for example in CvZ
 reCurse: After you're done with 10k simulations on the root state you only gained knowledge about the root state
 reCurse: When you go to the next state you have to restart from scratch
 reCurse: Hence the online part
 michaellan: it twould be the same set of weights regardless of the initial setup
 michaellan: wait wontonimo told me to do the thing where I just re-root the selected child as the new root
 michaellan: instead of throwing away my entire tree
 reCurse: When you go to a completely different state
 michaellan: yeah i see, i understand
 reCurse: What you searched previously doesn't help you
 michaellan: interesting
 reCurse: So reinforcement learning tries to accumulate knowledge to generalize to most situations
 reCurse: I mean how the term is typically used
 reCurse: Even though it doesn't have to
 michaellan: ah
 michaellan: semantics :rage:

 michaellan: mars lander optim seems really really really hard
 michaellan: the stupid collision sound is so darn loud too

 Maxim251: Somebody was playing ROBOT SHOW?
 Maxim251: I have problem, test cases I am making all, but after submit one case is fail.
 xxd: Uljahn: how do you know where to avoid? Like if there is not a straight path and you need to go around
 Maxim251: I use half step to find if robots are in this same place, especially if robot1 is on pos 3 and robot2 is on pos 4. 
 xxd: Maxim251: I solved it, maybe I can take a look at your code
 Maxim251: ok
 xxd: PM me
 xxd: I wont give you answers but I might be able to tell where you go wrong
 xxd: I'm just gonna say that there's a neat trick for this problem
 xxd: no simulation is necessary
 ProgrammerDog: hi
 TobiasA: i wish i could view peoples replay on mars lander
 Uljahn: xxd: guess there is always a straight part in Mars Lander opti, it's similar to ML ep.2
 xxd: I see
 xxd: thanks for that clarification
 Uljahn: not very straight but compared to ep.3 
 xxd: yeah... i saw Di masta's post mortem and that stuff was downright diabolical
 xxd: or i should say blogpost, not post mortem
 Messiahbolic: :nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: lol what?!i submitted my UTTT and then just left. came back to find myself at #36 (was 125 before)all I did was fixing the UCT formula using the parent instead of root
 xxd: NICE
 reCurse: Well it's pretty impactful
 reCurse: That formula was pretty wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i just figured so much :D
 xxd: I'm not sure how to further optimize
 xxd: other than maybe MCTS solver?
 xxd: i am already bitboarding pretty efficiently
 eulerscheZahl: that's the problem about the game
 eulerscheZahl: there isn't much to do except for performance boost
 reCurse: At least top 20-30 requires more than performance boost
 eulerscheZahl: ok. then i'm happy with my current rank and park the bot right there
 eulerscheZahl: i also added the teccles heuristic
 Westicles: Is that swifty guy the same as king coda?
 xxd: no hes the fallNToblivion guy

 eulerscheZahl: someone just pinged everyone on discord. and the moment I wanted to delete it, it was already gone
 xxd: damn
 eulerscheZahl: was that you reCurse?

 xxd: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: that steam sale message popped up a few times recently. I also deleted it once or twice when I was fast enough
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: Happens every day now
 reCurse: Usually lucky enough to catch it right when it pops
 reCurse: Almost time to consider making phone verification a requirement
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if that's a human or a bot
 reCurse: Bot probably
 Astrobytes: Very annoying, since it shows every channel with new messages to be read.
 eulerscheZahl: phone verification? then i would be out :scream:
 reCurse: Suspicious
 reCurse: You have no 2FA at all?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have a mobile phone
 reCurse: Many sites make 2FA mandatory now what do you do
 eulerscheZahl: i know. I avoid them
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 eulerscheZahl: i have 2FA at work. with a corporate card
 reCurse: Unfortunate
 xxd: we should make them solve an easy classic puzzle
 xxd: just joking
 reCurse: Well there are bots requiring arbitrary manual steps
 reCurse: Before you can post

 reCurse: _ForGiveMe_ it's better to just ask your question right away
 _ForGiveMe_: Not much of a question, kinda was looking help for the Temperatures puzzle
 Uljahn: is the help you are looking for language specific or just general hints?
 jacek: there are hints for temperature puzzle
 Tormugher: Hi! im stuck at temepature puzzle too
 xxd: what does "stuck" mean
 xxd: errors?
 Tormugher: im not sure if my method is correct
 Tormugher: "process has timed out"
 Tormugher: i added a new vairable "t1"
 jacek: timeout could also mean some crash
 jacek: what is your code
 Tormugher: and i divided it in 2, (&gt;0 and &lt;0)  then i keep adding 1/decresing until its 0
 Tormugher: for each 1 j=j+1 and then i compare it with the others results
 xxd: well, that... is one way you could do it
 xxd: you're probably timing out since if they're all positive you're gonna keep adding one and it will never become zero?
 Tormugher: sorry if I'm not clear english isn't my native language
 xxd: or you're just timing out in general because this approach is too slow
 xxd: your explanation makes sense, but your approach is wrong
 Tormugher: if they are positive it does j=j-1
 xxd: it shouldn't take longer to find the answer to [-1, 234203529835, -3497345345] than it should for [-1, 2, -3]
 Tormugher: hmm i didn't think about that
 Tormugher: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: the constraints say that the maximum absolute value is somewhere around 6000 (i forgot the exact number)
 eulerscheZahl: still the approach sounds really unusal me. nothing i would've come up with
 jacek: mhm
 SabertheLost: I soo do not understand how I should apply the Constant in this test "Monte Carlo Tree Search exercise"I manage to get the correct value for Large Test', but not most of the others. WTF.&#160;:) 
 xxd: which challenge
 SabertheLost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise</a>
 Uljahn: are you talking about C in UCT formula M.s/M.v + C*sqrt(ln(N.v)/M.v)?
 SabertheLost: I think so.
 SabertheLost: Not sure how it effects the score already calculated.
 xxd: ah
 xxd: so a good way i like to think about it
 xxd: is the left term is the "exploitation" term and the right term is the "exploration" term
 xxd: exploitation = keep doing what works
 xxd: exploration = try new things
 xxd: exploration term gets higher if the node seems to be good
 xxd: OOPS exploitation, not exploration
 xxd: exploration term gets higher the less visited a node is
 Uljahn: "I manage to get the correct value" - is it for C? it's given in the inputs btw
 xxd: so by controlling C, you control how much your MCTS is willing to explore by biasing the exploration term
 SabertheLost: "Uljahn  09:45PM"I manage to get the correct value" - is it for C? it's given in the inputs btw" I mean i get correct solution, but I think it just a bug
 xxd: that is why C is also known as the "exploration parameter"
 SabertheLost: I see I try it out a bit more thanks
 Uljahn: implementing MCTS for the first time could be hard, hence the difficulty of the puzzle
 xxd: hmm
 xxd: what exactly are we controlling for Mars lander if we are using PIID
 xxd: PID*
 xxd: the angle?

 xxd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7308627/javascript-calculate-the-nth-root-of-a-number">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7308627/javascript-calculate-the-nth-root-of-a-number</a>
 Uljahn: yes, the angle is dependent on the velocity and position difference
 xxd: do i need to change thrust around or should i just leave it at 3 or 4
 xxd: for CSB i just left it at the max
 xxd: unless i was turning around a corner
 SabertheLost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44a638ba-bffa-4e9b-a9bf-bd00920b09f2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44a638ba-bffa-4e9b-a9bf-bd00920b09f2</a>
 xxd: well root is the same for each path
 Scarfield: You could do both angle (pod direction) and thrust. but could probably make it land with only control on the angle, and simple heuristic on thrust. If you want to optimize on fuel usage, you need something less "simple" i guess
 xxd: yeah im just gonna focus on angle for now
 xxd: physics problems are not my area of expertisee
 xxd: so i guess angle is a function of h_speed and thrust is a function of v_speed 
 Scarfield: i think implementing a PID for mars lander is making it harder than it has to be. you still need a path to steer after. Coding some kind of search with a simulator is not as hard i think
 xxd: by the way, this is not the hard one where you need to navigate around
 xxd: i think Uljahn said above that theres like a general path
 xxd: going straight there
 Scarfield: ah okay, i just assumed that it was&#160;:)
 Uljahn: yes, i use h_speed for angle calculation and v_speed for thrust
 Uljahn: gravity is 3.711, so always 4 is a bit more than needed to maintain velocity, you'll fly away
 xxd: yup, i'll keeep that in mind
 Scarfield: within some angle region, turning to much you will still make you fall faster
 xxd: why is physics so compilcated D&#160;:
 Uljahn: also it's easy to calculate the angle which gives perfect balance with gravity, simple trig
 xxd: is that a special case thats necessary?
 xxd: doesnt seem like thats... particularly useful?
 xxd: oh
 Uljahn: no, just to understand some details
 xxd: the other part that scares me is
 xxd: you need to be exactly 0 degrees when you hit the ground
 xxd: LOL i can make myself go upsidiie down
 Scarfield: but you can move ut to 40m/s horisontally iirc
 Scarfield: up to*
 Uljahn: 20
 xxd: ah
 xxd: so just swerve myself back upright when its time
 Scarfield: yup
 xxd: ah, i control the *desired* rotation angle
 xxd: i thought i had to control the delta
 xxd: i think thats a bit easier
 Scarfield: yea, you are limited by a max angle change of 15deg per turn though
 Scarfield: i think its 15(?)
 xxd: yup ur right
 xxd: but that means i can just focus on the PID part i think
 SabertheLost: woohoo, I got it working, (only one that fails is the one with the same score sorting)
 SabertheLost: ... almost.. damn
 xxd: nice, good work
 xxd: what language are you doing it in BTW?
 SabertheLost: java
 xxd: man this math is so hard, i have an urge to learn simulated annealing for this
 jacek: math, not even once
 Geiler: When I clash with few people the problems are always easy, but when the lobby is full, we get hard ones
 Astrobytes: 1 letter away from disaster... Yeah it doesn't work like that afaik
 Astrobytes: It's just random clashes whatever you do
 xxd: hi astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hi xxd, what you up to
 xxd: mars lander, still&#160;:) how about you?
 Astrobytes: I was rewriting some Vindinium and accidentally submitted, trying to get my rank back&#160;:( :D
 xxd: ahhhahaha, thats the worst
 Astrobytes: Yeah, well, guess it forces me to rewrite properly at least :D
 Astrobytes: How's Mars Lander going?
 xxd: I... don't think i'm doing it correctly 
 xxd: I'm doing PID controllers-style and tinkering with some magic constants
 AllYourTrees: import antigravity
 xxd: thrust=4
 Astrobytes: use python; import everything
 xxd: i think i'm gonna scrap this and try sim. annealing
 Astrobytes: Mars Lander... I did a GA, it worked. Something like SA might be better though
 xxd: this is the medium one btw
 xxd: overkill? or no
 Astrobytes: No not overkill.
 Astrobytes: I think I did the GA for the optim, then did that one
 Astrobytes: Or something like that. My memory fails me currently
 xxd: alright yeah. im gonna write up something that would kill two birds with one stone (medium puzzle and optim)
 xxd: how would evaluation function work for Mars Lander?
 xxd: i guess i can use some combination of the ending velocities/angle
 BlaiseEbuth: if(!crash)return INF;else return -INF;
 xxd: joking? or for real
 xxd: that doesnt seem  very useful
 xxd: lol
 xxd: oh wait... duh i should incorporate how much fuel is left
 Astrobytes: yeah, distance, angle, velocity all the usual stuff
 Astrobytes: You can, yes
 xxd: yea but thats more for the optim one i guess
 SabertheLost: I love it when I get 6/7 correct in the test-cases in the IDE. but 100% when I submit.
 xxd: hmmmmmmMMMMMMM
 xxd: oh WAIT
 xxd: someone mentions a strategy in the forum where you control separately vertical and horizontal motions
 xxd: i think i wlil try that first
 SabertheLost: Ok, now i got it working on both. Was adding double the amout of visitors on each node&#160;:) 
 Westicles: one letter :smirk:
 SabertheLost: yeah, letter not node. 
 Astrobytes: Westicles :innocent:
 TheOneCode: is there a way to play clash only with python programmern?
 Rob022: only private with friends
 TheOneCode: okay thx
 Astrobytes: submission limit for optims &lt; than for multis?
 reCurse: I don't think so
 Astrobytes: Hm. Seems I hit the limit quicker than usual. It's late, so I'll test it properly at another time I guess.
 xxd: i'll test it for you :wink:
 Astrobytes: It really does seem to be less tolerant, but I've had 3 beers so I'm declaring nothing as fact right now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: data dangler gambler rangler band member
 michaellan: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: you alright there Patrick
 xxd: i took a nap, now im back, gonna try cheesing mars lander 2
 Westicles: some people call me maurice? no, that's not it...
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes: possibly to avoid random optimization?
 Astrobytes: I improved my ML optim position by 331 rank-wise, 152 points ...
 BlaiseEbuth: Time for a dark coffee.
 Astrobytes: Westicles: hah! :D
 Astrobytes: anyway, laters all, take care and all that, gn
 BlaiseEbuth: Giant nipple :wave:
 xxd: huh
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Astrobytes: bn Blaise
 xxd: big nipple
 BlaiseEbuth: Bonne nuit :flag_fr:
 Astrobytes: :baguette:
 Astrobytes: :french_bread:
 KNTK: Any idea at what time ratings are updated?
 xxd: like 5:30PST for me
 KNTK: Thank you
 xxd: so in about an hour
 KNTK: Another silly quoestion: Do you get more points from codegolf, if you use many languages?
 xxd: yeah i think so
 xxd: but only like top 3 or so
 xxd: but the codinpoints for Code golf is very little
 KNTK: I suppose I have to focus on bots then
 xxd: yeah thats the conclusion i came to as well
 Westicles: golf score is your best five languages
 xxd: ah i stand corrected
 vysor: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 KNTK: As in best five languages for each separate codegolf, not those on my profile.
 xxd: yes
 Westicles: click ranking on your profile page, it shows where your points come from
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my data is dangled
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Before accessing the top solutions, help us to rank them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: meh
 xxd: at least theres a new legend achievement ofr that
 Westicles: pat's into that purple drank again
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup
 xxd: the "High ground" test seems a bit annoying for ML...
 xxd: wondering if i should special-case it or take in delta Y in my angle calculation
 DR_IQWDJ: minesweeper was pretty cool to do but when it came to submitting it took me quite a while to get the 100%
 omar1o1: aaaa
 omar1o1: .
 Swyfti: minesweepers?
 michaellan: oh its swyfti
 michaellan: ._.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :zipper_mouth:
 michaellan: so whos gonna tell him
 PatrickMcGinnisII: took me hours, only got 165xp
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 puzzles, smh
 xxd: how 165?
 xxd: normally 50xp each for community puzzles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: code reviewer thing
 michaellan: ah nice
 xxd: wow, 4 people simultaneously streaming CG on twitch, coolio
 WilliamPearsall: what's a good ranking in CoC?
 Westicles: 76,941
 xxd: depends
 xxd: 19th
 WilliamPearsall: so like sitting around 1k isn't great?
 xxd: thats great
 xxd: bot programming, for one, is much more rewarding than playing CoC
 WilliamPearsall: I actually disllike AI programming
 WilliamPearsall: But that's probably a familiarity thing.
 xxd: as in you're unfamiliar, or overly familiar?
 WilliamPearsall: unfamiliar. I work in etling and data so data manipulation is comfy.
 xxd: ah. well i didnt know anything about AI till a few weeks ago
 WilliamPearsall: heh
 xxd: but i think its good if you have the luxury and time to sink your teeth in
 WilliamPearsall: never hurts to know more.
 xxd: as for CoC, i'd say aim for the legend achievement
 xxd: win 3 games in a row
 WilliamPearsall: 2 is my current run. I was 4 seconds off from 3 last night, but my buddy started talking to me during the third game.
 xxd: aw
 michaellan: it's not too bad if i'm gonna be honest
 michaellan: worst case you can just run the games with bots
 michaellan: who have pretty predictable performance
 BlaiseEbuth: Muahahaha! :imp:
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000, still alive?
 Automaton2000: jacek there is degrade bug created by my mistake yesterday in animation update i am just not sure how
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't ping people like this Automaton2000!
 Automaton2000: the problem is not the way i do it for a while
 xxd: Automaton2000 do you even clash of code bro
 Automaton2000: but i wonder if it's the same shit
 BlaiseEbuth: :grin:
 xxd: Automaton2000: i think its still the same problem you've been experiencing
 Automaton2000: so maybe you should just be able to do it now :p
 xxd: Automaton2000 i hate you
 Automaton2000: that should take me a while to get used to it

 cegprakash: hey icecream17 and Crog plz promote me
 cegprakash: I'm only 0.25 away from silver boss
 cegprakash: plz resubmit icecream17 I have good win rate against u
 cegprakash: once I get promoted if u resubmit may be u can also get promoted because I won't be there on ur way
 aCat: lol :D
 aCat: collaborative bossfighting
 Uljahn: so your goal is bottom gold :smirk:
 Nerchio: gold is a respectful league :p
 Uljahn: ye, for a newb like me :smiley:
 cegprakash: Uljahn push me
 cegprakash: you can
 K4Mx: how is decided who makes the first turn in Onitama bots pvp battles&#160;? 
 K4Mx: or its indirect pvp&#160;? ie who score the best vs CPU (and i will be disappointed)
 K4Mx: bc its pve in the nd xD
 K4Mx: bc its pve in the end xD
 MSmits: K4Mx the bots are on the leaderboard, when you submit, you play battles against them and go up the leaderboard if your bot is any good
 MSmits: the boss is just to have  a bot to practice against and to act as a gatekeeper for the highest league
 MSmits: the first turn is random in the case of onitama
 K4Mx: can i pick a specific vs bot , ie my friends bot 
 MSmits: but can be different in other games
 MSmits: to practice against yes, once you have submitted and your friend is in the same or lower league
 K4Mx: thank you 
 MSmits: np, onitama is not the easiest game to start with though, be aware of that
 K4Mx: it appeals really much to me though
 MSmits: ultimate tic tac toe might be easier, it starts with regular tic tac toe up to bronze league
 MSmits: sure, thats important too
 K4Mx: its fine ill grind my head on onitama 
 MSmits: kk
 K4Mx: :grin:
 Nerchio: i programmed a bot for ghost in a cell and it is playing in a way i don't even recognize it
 Nerchio: xD
 AntiSquid: it is taking over
 Nerchio: it can't even take over bronze 
 Nerchio: so im not sure about that xD
 K4Mx: omg my bot is alive
 K4Mx: i love this website and commiunity xD
 K4Mx: *first move dance* 
 AntiSquid: the bug took over your bot
 CapoDiTuttiCapi: i hate shortest mode
 CapoDiTuttiCapi: is there a method to always play fastest mode?
 Uljahn: yesif not shortest: leave()
 Uljahn: or fastest
 ashelkov: my fav is shortest&#160;:)
 ashelkov: and reverse
 wlesavo: leave=[0,1][!fastest|shortest]
 AntiSquid: if len([fun:]) &gt; 0: 
 CapoDiTuttiCapi:&#160;:)))))
 AntiSquid: can't play&#160;:/
 CapoDiTuttiCapi: is there some way to access the history of matches played to see your evolution?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: click on Last battles on the left side
 thanos11: hi..
 MSmits: :ok_hand:
 MSmits: thats me snapping my fingers thanos style
 MSmits: hi
 Crypticsy: hey, how do you do list.pop() in clojure?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, MSmits already got me&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 MSmits: thanks, code is mostly done. Just working on eval
 ZarthaxX: got you where?
 MSmits: onitama
 ZarthaxX: lets see that lb mhm
 MSmits: nice thing about onitama is that games are short. Makes it easy to tune constants&#160;:)
 MSmits: I might write a tuner program that can do it locally, if I feel like it
 MSmits: but I would have to copy your board generation code eulerscheZahl, not sure how much work that is
 MSmits: well actually just your card generation code
 MSmits: thats all that is different between games
 eulerscheZahl: very little code
 eulerscheZahl: 16 different cards i think
 eulerscheZahl: take 5 by random
 MSmits: some exceptions right
 eulerscheZahl: a few combinations are excluded as easily solvable
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: this bot is bascially the same as my oware bot
 MSmits: just way worse eval atm
 MSmits: oware is extremely tuned

 MSmits: gith still having issues
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.githubstatus.com/">https://www.githubstatus.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: working fine for me but they report an incident
 MSmits: now it works again
 eulerscheZahl: lots of red in the monitoring for such a big website
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i would expect such a graph from the CG chat but not github
 MSmits: they're probably being targeted
 MSmits: or coding is something that happens more during corona crisis
 eulerscheZahl: maybe 2 years ago there was a major downtime too with a corrupted database. they wrote a detailed blogpost about what went wrong
 eulerscheZahl: but this time i just see that it's resolved without explanations what happened
 eulerscheZahl: btw you can now have unlimited contributors on your private repos (used to be 3 for free accounts)
 MSmits: I never had a contributor including myself&#160;:)
 MSmits: I just post playgrounds
 MSmits: but I like that stuff cna be private now
 MSmits: wow look at this one
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454207564">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454207564</a>
 MSmits: see how fast it's solved
 MSmits: seems like an exception though, probably low branching
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454204227">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454204227</a>and here i screwed up, looking at your output
 MSmits: lol yea... its possible. I am not 100% sure that I have no bugs
 MSmits: but since I am the one that won... not sure
 eulerscheZahl: when you decide that you will lose, do you still try to play as good as you can and hope for a weak opponent?
 eulerscheZahl: as in your replay the losing player didn't even try i think
 MSmits: I choose the node that has the most visits. Meaning it takes the node that took longest to solve as a loss
 Astrobytes: Same as your Oware bot
 MSmits: that increases the likelyhood the opponent didnt solve the win
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: about the other replay, i dunno, maybe it really didnt have an option. 
 MSmits: my eval is not card based, just position based
 MSmits: a better eval would take the actual cards into account
 MSmits: and possibly also the positons of students and masters
 MSmits: i mean not just the self-positions
 MSmits: but the positions compared to others
 MSmits: but lower difficulty would be to take cards into account
 MSmits: it's not bad to be on the left side, if the cards all give you moves to the right... for example
 MSmits: not sure how sophisticated the other bots are, but I get the feeling the search-type is far less important than the quality of the eval
 eulerscheZahl: or just having cards with many legal moves
 MSmits: oh, right yes
 MSmits: I am also not sure if positions should take all cards into account or just the cards you have
 MSmits: because you can use those cards only once and then the opponent will have them
 eulerscheZahl: maybe a mix of both
 MSmits: possibly, can do both, put a constant in there and see what happens when you tune
 MSmits: but I am just going to finish tuning my current simple eval, then it can be a baseline later
 MSmits: while I am doing that, I was thinking of coding a STC bot
 MSmits: the biggest challenge for that one seems to be a fast sim
 MSmits: I was thinking a uint16_t bitboard per color, floodfill for checking combos
 MSmits: a rotated bitboard though, falling to the left, so uint16_t[6] per color
 MSmits: to the right that is
 MSmits: then when stuff disappears, i can shift right in some way... not sure if it is worth it. Seems really complicated
 eulerscheZahl: at some point performance doesn't even matter than much at STC i think
 eulerscheZahl: you need lots of sims. but when you reach them, more doesn't help much anymore
 eulerscheZahl: at least for what i'm doing (i mostly ignore my opponent)
 MSmits: there are many games where that is true yeah
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to play different opponent attack scenarios, you'll need more sims i think
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: cool thing about this is that part of the code can be reused for tulips and daisies
 MSmits: though you need 4 in a row there
 eulerscheZahl: did they redesign the IDE leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: avatars are much bigger
 MSmits: not sure, lemme refresh
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: nice
 wlesavo: oh, mb thats why it was laggy today
 reCurse: I don't see any difference...
 pb4: MSmits&#160;: STC is "bitboardable" if you want to try
 reCurse: Everything is bitboardable if you're creative enough and don't care about perf
 pb4: Jeff06 did it
 pb4: His perf were respectable at the time of the contest
 reCurse: I was giving motivation to MSbits
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's a bit of an obsession
 eulerscheZahl: a bit :D
 reCurse: I see what you did there
 MSmits: :grin:
 reCurse: One day you'll be worthy of the challenge
 reCurse: CSB in bitboards
 MSmits: ehh lol, not quite that masochistic 
 MSmits: do you ever use bitboard reCurse? I thought you did on ice and fire
 reCurse: I did
 MSmits: and on some boardgames i wont mention
 reCurse: Uh?
 reCurse: No bitboard on uttt
 MSmits: the u-word
 MSmits: oh?
 MSmits: thats original
 reCurse: Is it
 MSmits: most top players have it
 reCurse: Why
 MSmits: no idea, tunnel vision?
 reCurse: Just kidding I have bitboards
 MSmits: lol
 reCurse: Well I did go through a number of versions...
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: actually i have 3 systems in my live bot not counting the input system
 MSmits: binary, ternay and something to compact my state representation for opening books
 MSmits: got a little out of hand there
 reCurse: You have exceeded your allotted quota for discussing the topic: UTTT
 MSmits: agreed&#160;:)
 MSmits: darkhorse will not be happy
 MSmits: just passed him in onitama... but its probably a random fluke, his bot is still stronger
 darkhorse64: I said no more coding before next contest
 MSmits: oh, did not get the memo. I will stop coding now then
 MSmits: will just tune constants :P
 MSmits: i wonder if you have anything fancy in your eval besides position based scores
 MSmits: like card based stuff
 reCurse: You have exceeded your allotted quota for discussing the topic: coding
 MSmits: bah
 reCurse: :P
 MSmits: are you going to throw traffic lights at me soon?
 <b>**reCurse takes notes</b></p><p><img src="/a/23496414257567" /> darkhorse64: for now position based scores but it's clearly not enough
 MSmits: same as me then. It helps a lot though
 MSmits: when i implemented a first version of that, it had 85% vs my version that just counted knights
 darkhorse64: A vanilla MCTS would rank at eulerscheZahl place
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it did
 MSmits: I was almost the same rating as euler, with counting knights
 eulerscheZahl: i have a position scoring but not sure if it's any good
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm scoring the wrong things
 MSmits: it's probably good, but you're also using C#
 MSmits: performance matters here
 eulerscheZahl: illedan still much higher than me
 MSmits: hmm thats true
 eulerscheZahl: but i admit i didn't tune for performance
 eulerscheZahl: for me it was more about coding the game than actually playing ti
 eulerscheZahl: it
 MSmits: yeah, that is a victory in and of itself, it's a great addition
 AntiSquid: need multi of the week with xp reward for participation
 MSmits: mmh how to define participation?
 eulerscheZahl: we have enough multis to almost fill a year with it
 eulerscheZahl: legend
 darkhorse64: Do 25 XP really matter&#160;?
 MSmits: sometimes a small incentive gets people to try a multi
 reCurse: All I see is wasted potential of CG to host smaller events
 MSmits: You mean contests
 eulerscheZahl: i noticed player count got up when it was the puzzle of the week
 reCurse: Doesn't have to be contest
 AntiSquid: even just submitting, get some activity up, more xp if rank increases / promotion / etc why not
 MSmits: you're right, it is half wasted. A game can be a contest and then a multi
 MSmits: well however you define contest
 reCurse: The concept of mini-contest is unexplored
 MSmits: like br2k was
 reCurse: Could have been done with minimum resources I think
 reCurse: oh well
 eulerscheZahl: onitama doesn't have depth for a full contest i think. but for a weekend it would be fine
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and we get more and more contributions like that
 MSmits: it's not easy to estimate a good length for a contest it seems
 reCurse: It's not about length at all
 reCurse: If you can have puzzle of the week
 reCurse: You can have challenge of the week
 reCurse: No leagues
 reCurse: No rerun
 MSmits: I totally agree
 reCurse: But achievement/mention of top 3 somewhere
 reCurse: Or XP bonus for top 50
 reCurse: Who knows
 reCurse: Tons of options
 MSmits: did someone make this suggestion?
 MSmits: I  mean apart from here
 reCurse: I don't care about making suggestions that are any more complex than ~1 LOC :P
 reCurse: They don't get done
 MSmits: -1 LOC?
 AntiSquid: focusing too much on difficulty of the game, i mean we had a puzzle of the week where all you had to do was output cube of a number or something equally easy, forgot what it was
 reCurse: tilde 1
 reCurse: Stupid font
 MSmits: ok but what is LOC?
 reCurse: line of code
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: i can see the tilde
 darkhorse64: +1
 MSmits: btw darkhorse64, i am not using transposition tables
 MSmits: dont wanna waste your time trying.  It was too slow. I think rehashing timed me out
 MSmits: it works on yavalath because you expand 60 hexes and expansion happens a lot less
 MSmits: well it arguably works, it wasnt great
 eulerscheZahl: compared to having few move options in onitama?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: so many more expansions
 MSmits: even though it has a ton of repeated states
 MSmits: so TT should work... it didnt for me
 AntiSquid: showing confidence in darkhorse's abilities: i failed so you better not waste your time little bugger
 MSmits: haha thats not what i mean
 MSmits: I meant, I spent the time writing a crazy 64 bit state representation
 MSmits: it's not worth it without TT
 MSmits: well once you have it, it's fine
 MSmits: but the debugging is insane
 MSmits: you need to use pext and pdep just to know where you master is
 eulerscheZahl: board.Players[MY_ID].Master.Celli have some indirection too
 MSmits: I think maybe it would be cool to have it for a minimax, because with minimax you can just do TT up to depth 6 or so
 MSmits: with mcts i save the tree between turns, too complex
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl ah ok, i am not sure how that compares with speed of pext and pdep
 MSmits: they are multiple instructions
 MSmits: inline uint32_t GetMasterPosition(uint32_t playerBoard, int masterIndex){	return __builtin_ctz(_pdep_u32(1 &lt;&lt; masterIndex, playerBoard));}
 MSmits: the index tells you which of the 5 bits on the boards is a master, so it's between 0 and 4
 eulerscheZahl: so you have 25 bits with up to 5 1's and another 3 bit to tell the master?
 MSmits: yes
 eulerscheZahl: but do that twice and you can't store the cards anymore
 MSmits: i can
 MSmits: there are 30 card states
 MSmits:  thats 5 bit
 eulerscheZahl: ah, so you have the cards in play as a global variable i guess (you like globals)
 eulerscheZahl: and just store the index in each board
 MSmits: yep
 eulerscheZahl: the permutation*
 MSmits: thats what i do, you have to be a bit careful about the fact that 0,1,2,3,4 is the same as 1, 0, 2, 4, 3
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: you talked about it earlier
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I can talk about this stuff forever :P
 eulerscheZahl: 2 is the middle card then?
 MSmits: the 3rd in the list is yes
 darkhorse64: Is this just for weekend challenges, to what extremities will you go for the next context&#160;? Bitboarding all pacman
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/46f2b3fe-835d-4081-967b-7947fdfa12ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/46f2b3fe-835d-4081-967b-7947fdfa12ee</a>
 MSmits: i don't know darkhorse64, I always fear not having enough time to code some extreme state representation
 MSmits: you need time to come up with good pruning heuristics, strategy, tune constants etc.
 MSmits: you cant take till 2nd friday just to get a working bot 
 darkhorse64: That's why I like the relaxing aspect of multi. Need a month to get Legend&#160;? No worries
 MSmits: time is a resource in a 10 day contest for me. Not for euler I think. 
 MSmits: i agree darkhorse64
 eulerscheZahl: i'm usually running out of ideas before the end :D
 eulerscheZahl: or motivation
 eulerscheZahl: or both
 MSmits: thats what i mean, I am fighting against the clock. The worst thing for me is not ending lower than usual, it is having untried ideas when the deadline hits

 Nerchio: ye hehe
 Nerchio: i know
 Nerchio: the 0 factories are kinda useless but i need some logic to capture them too
 eulerscheZahl: they can help for upgrading
 eulerscheZahl: but not in the early game
 Nerchio: i just move between factories length &lt;=4 usually so idk on some maps i might be closed if i dont take 0 factories
 eulerscheZahl: ther's nothing wrong with taking them
 eulerscheZahl: just a matter of priorization
 Nerchio: and you need some logic for smaller maps
 Nerchio: where taking 10cyborg neutral factory can kill you
 eulerscheZahl: the game is not that simple
 Nerchio: I can see

 cegprakash: and wait for ppl to push 
 cegprakash: no shame in that
 cegprakash: I won't stop here though
 cegprakash: 60+ ppl in legend
 cegprakash: means I can also do it
 Nerchio: gold is the hardest but i hope you can do it :p
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of people are over 2 meters tall. yet i see now way how i could do it
 eulerscheZahl: your reasoning is invalid ceg
 cegprakash: remember that I'm top #20 in one of the challenges

 cegprakash: to reach other side
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: I was in top #20
 cegprakash: I didn't do the conteset
 cegprakash: I joined multiplayer
 cegprakash: and I learnt that 3 wall thing
 eulerscheZahl: i know, you told everyone on the chat
 AntiSquid: over 500 space travelers, so you should also do it cegprakash
 cegprakash: and added a counter strat
 ZarthaxX: lol

 Zenoscave: what game did you release that they hid
 eulerscheZahl: pacman
 AntiSquid: pacman
 Zenoscave: nice lol
 AntiSquid: probably without the power ups in the cover image
 cegprakash: 4 players everyone controlling 1 car?
 cegprakash: or 2 cars?

 Zenoscave: Heya MadKnight
 cegprakash: link the contest
 Zenoscave: how's your bot
 AntiSquid: i don't like it, do you MadKnight&#160;?
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave he is 1st in 4 player CSB lol
 AntiSquid: he achieved the dream
 MadKnight: yea this new design looks weird
 Zenoscave: Nice gz
 AntiSquid: he transcended the heavens
 cegprakash: for god sake someone show me the game
 MadKnight: let's hire Automaton2000 as a designer
 Automaton2000: but if you go to the leaderboard
 AntiSquid: i am #19 with D on the 4 player CSB leaderboad btw, proves the efficiency of the language
 aCat: Is it possible to create clickable link in the puzzle description? 
 aCat: simply use html tag?
 aCat: "classic in-out puzzle"
 eulerscheZahl: only in SDK contributions
 aCat: ah, ok, thx euler
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to add a viewer now&#160;;)
 aCat: nay, not my puzzle
 aCat: I'm reviewing
 aCat: but my own will bo up I hope soon :P
 eulerscheZahl: in-out puzzle? multiplayer?
 aCat: I wanted to make some simple optimization ones
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 aCat: simple, don't get too much excited
 eulerscheZahl: worth approving then?
 aCat: based on some labtasks from the AI course
 aCat: your magnificent frogginess will decide ;p
 dbdr: how can optimization be simple?
 eulerscheZahl: can we find the optimal score?
 dbdr: either you can achieve the optimal, and it's kind of pointless
 cegprakash: why am I watching Join the PAC spring video on loop
 cegprakash: am I going to win it
 Zenoscave: no
 eulerscheZahl: no
 dbdr: or you can't and it's not simple
 Zenoscave: Winning would mean you'd have to read the instructions
 aCat: ok, you will not jum over the language performacne
 eulerscheZahl: if you can solve it, make it a puzzle and demand a certain score

 aCat: actually I wanted to ask this question a few days ago
 aCat:&#160;;]
 aCat: ok
 eulerscheZahl: almost forgot my own contribution now :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>
 aCat: I will do something, definitely
 Nerchio: how do you go about writing one of these?
 aCat: when I finally remember how to show that damn graphics
 struct: Nerchio you need to use codingame SDK
 eulerscheZahl: takes a while, start with the documentation: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction</a>
 aCat: bleh, takes some blood 
 BenjaminUrquhart: pro tip: don't keep creating sprites cause the viewer will crash if you do
 struct: once you get used to it, it gets easier
 eulerscheZahl: as you know java but not the SDK, plan 1 weekend to get something simple like tic tac toe working
 eulerscheZahl: when you are into it, you can do it in 1 afternoon
 eulerscheZahl: BenjaminUrquhart exactly, was there too :D
 aCat: oph my, I still remember the pain optimizing number of sprites in LOCM
 struct: After I understood it I made very simple Connect 4 in 1:30 hours
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK got a lot better here aCat
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium used around 1.5GB RAM for a single match on a large map
 eulerscheZahl: now it's around 100MB i think
 aCat: I don't remember connect 4 as multi game?
 struct: not to mention that it used to crash every timne
 struct: I never released it aCat
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c</a>
 aCat: why?
 struct: Its stuck as a demo
 struct: Connect 4 is solved
 aCat: I really think all the classic stuff like, checkers, breakthrough etc should be here
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/46281f7f235246e27d00f9d9db645461a4db">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/46281f7f235246e27d00f9d9db645461a4db</a>you can still download the code
 eulerscheZahl: checkers and breakthrough are!
 dbdr: why not change SIZE = 4 to SIZE = 5?
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough</a>

 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/checkers">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/checkers</a>
 aCat: It's great they are
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh lol
 eulerscheZahl: connect 5?
 jacek: oh
 struct: Could also be connect N
 aCat: I know you guys think in categories solved/not
 dbdr: yeah
 aCat: but these are great tasks for students
 dbdr: slightly larger so it's not solved
 eulerscheZahl: more prone to ties i suppose
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know of course
 aCat: and not ass complicated as normal multi
 aCat: *as
 aCat: lol
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/37/">https://xkcd.com/37/</a>
 struct: Maybe there should be one more cattegory
 struct: Like Training multiplayers
 struct: or practice*
 eulerscheZahl: take connect4, add a default bot and turn it into a puzzle. beat the boss on some initial states, tie on others
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's called wood league /s
 dbdr: ultimate connect 4
 struct: Turn limits&#160;:(
 jacek: or connect4, but connect3 is losing
 eulerscheZahl: on a hex board
 dbdr: each piece is a conect 4 game
 BenjaminUrquhart: every circle is a connect 4 game
 AntiSquid: normal ass multi
 dbdr: or mix games for more fun
 dbdr: ttt in connect 4, and connect 4 in ttt
 aCat: that's another issue that I suppose when there are anough players in the game more leagues should be opened
 AntiSquid: connect 4 with rotation
 BenjaminUrquhart: leagues in breakthrough when
 dbdr: connect 4 with velocity and friction and collisions
 AntiSquid: ultimate ocean of code for more fun 
 BenjaminUrquhart: bumper car c4
 eulerscheZahl: sadly community multiplayers aren't that popular anyways. you don't really need leagues
 dbdr: some are
 jacek: but brakthrough has over 145
 aCat: yeh i know
 aCat: that's sad&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium with 268 is the most popular i think
 AntiSquid: ya
 aCat: If I will push students for some games I can double the playerbase :D
 aCat: for the less popular ones
 AntiSquid: but vindinium was popular before CG
 struct: Paper soccer
 aCat: checkers also lol
 jacek: :3
 eulerscheZahl: yes and the first community multiplayer
 aCat: I lake this current game
 eulerscheZahl: now there are so many that it's hard to be seen
 aCat: *like
 AntiSquid: the old way of splitting CG original and community stuff was better imo
 eulerscheZahl: which current game?
 AntiSquid: why hide the origin @_@
 dbdr: I just started to look at Tulips and Daisies
 struct: Im still thinking if I should port Code Vs Reborn or not
 eulerscheZahl: you don't even need a total split. maybe split at first but with a chance for some worthy contributions to promote to the official area
 eulerscheZahl: like that forest fire that's in a similar quality as official puzzles
 AntiSquid: struct the answer is yes
 AntiSquid: but only if we can have pokeman characters
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that the STC variant?
 AntiSquid: otherwise it deserves a downvote
 eulerscheZahl: i would say "yes" if there wasn't STC already
 struct: Yes, the one where it needs to add to 10
 AntiSquid: port code samurai :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://samuraicoding.info/index.html">https://samuraicoding.info/index.html</a>
 struct: val won
 struct: nice
 AntiSquid: even better port Fighting game Ai:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzbr79l_Om8&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzbr79l_Om8&amp;feature=emb_logo</a>

 aCat: actuall
 aCat: maybe not port direct
 aCat: but I suppose something in this still will be cool contest game 
 aCat: and definitely doable
 tobk: I just noticed that i CotC the actions for the individual ships of the silver boss are shown in the viewer, but only for the boss and no other player. how does it do that?
 AntiSquid: msg&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: print a message
 eulerscheZahl: check the output of the boss in the console
 tobk: oh, right, you can append any message to the action
 tobk: does not say so in the statement, though
 FIFA: .
 eulerscheZahl: mean statemetn
 tobk: works perfectly, thanks
 AntiSquid: oh samurai ai code runs every year
 AntiSquid: and it looks much better than battlecode
 eulerscheZahl: but has a long running time, i prefer short contests :scream:
 AntiSquid: how long is it&#160;? didn't check
 eulerscheZahl: it also has prizes, about 400 euro for the winner
 idkhow2codee: week?
 eulerscheZahl: 2 months testing, 2 months contest it seems
 BenjaminUrquhart: ew
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC extreme
 dbdr: oh&#160;:(<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/2293/">https://xkcd.com/2293/</a>
 AntiSquid: so kinda like halite
 aCat: that's beautiful
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that's why we have a conway multi pending now&#160;:(
 dbdr: nice idea
 jacek: battle of game of life?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AntiSquid: wow interesting <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/2296/">https://xkcd.com/2296/</a>
 dbdr: I don't have the knowledge to understand that one

 AntiSquid: well a starter is just flour and water and yeast, you could have yeast added or leave it out so yeast that circulates through the air gets in 
 aCat: c'mon you can filter contributions on puzzles/clash not a multi, bleh
 dbdr: how likely / fast is that?
 eulerscheZahl: because the filter is older than the SDK
 aCat: haha :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6</a>another cool contribution
 AntiSquid: well gathering "wild" yeast can be slow 
 eulerscheZahl: but he wanted an optim and it's a puzzle&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: so it seems he lost interest
 AntiSquid: can't even download :p
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 aCat: yeah I had similar idea once
 aCat: It was partially coded
 eulerscheZahl: and now aCat joined a clash and left us
 aCat: Ididn't ;p
 eulerscheZahl: main page said something else
 aCat: I have something so ugly I have no idea how to make it
 aCat: how you have notification that i entered the clas?
 eulerscheZahl: upload faster, screenshot tool...
 eulerscheZahl: there's some nonsense going on on the homepage
 eulerscheZahl: showing you the next clash and who's in
 aCat: but that dind'm mean I'm here talking with you :P
 eulerscheZahl: but a clash is about speedi'm sure you lost now
 aCat: 1) it's about size
 jacek: i think im gonna invite someone to clash
 struct: not always
 aCat: 2) noone did anything
 aCat: 3) ot's damn nicola mathematical stuff
 eulerscheZahl: you did that yesterday already jacek
 AntiSquid: it's about having a solution DB ready 
 aCat: i have no idea how to solve it
 jacek: eulerscheZahl and you declined&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i ignored
 aCat: 4) actually i'm not clashing but douing achievement hunting lol ;p
 aCat: 434 to go ;p
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 aCat: or sth like that
 AntiSquid: i got top 100 in clash just by instantly quitting for the achievement
 aCat: fasetest 0% is still best 0%&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: fastest to reach 0%
 eulerscheZahl: and aCat was faster than me
 AntiSquid: and probably shortest 0% too&#160;?
 aCat: damn
 aCat: and I forgot i'm doing shortest:D:D
 aCat: I have the fastest 0% 273 chars
 aCat: ^^'
 struct: 500 clashes for achievement
 struct: danb
 struct: damn
 AntiSquid: work on your multi aCat, don't you care about the community?
 Nerchio: omg
 Nerchio: i was debugging my bot looking at the enemy for the past 1 0minutes
 aCat: ok, ok, i will do something 
 aCat: got my promise
 aCat: some day
 aCat: :D
 struct: port Starcraft Nerchi o
 AntiSquid: autochess / mortal combat / volleyball
 struct: also cs go since it was leaked
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZVqLbSZ5gE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZVqLbSZ5gE</a>
 eulerscheZahl: blobby volley
 AntiSquid: just port dead or alive beach volleyball ezpz
 eulerscheZahl: why is there always so annoying music in sports summaries on youtube?
 AntiSquid: it's to emphasize on the suspence
 eulerscheZahl: we have sports commentators for that
 AntiSquid: ya i like when they stutter and say something like "uh ah ... ogh &lt;unintelligible&gt;"

 Nerchio: hehe i started meeting darkhose64 and leonjean in silver
 dbdr: a rather predictable lb
 eulerscheZahl: there are more familiar players waiting for you to be unlocked
 Nerchio: i will not stop until i am destroying your bot :D
 dbdr: famous last wods
 dbdr: *words
 eulerscheZahl: i should work on my upgrade behaviour, it's broken
 AntiSquid: obviously D is not in release mode or you'd get rekt hard dbdr
 JBM: lol
 dbdr: obviously
 dbdr: it's all about perf at this point
 muy31: i have a question about mars lander...
 muy31: does the units seconds correspond to actual time or turns 
 muy31: like 1 turn = 1 second,
 muy31: or i need to use system time?
 Nerchio: so many people who got legend in ooc are in silver ghost in the cell :p
 Nerchio: they didnt like that?
 Zenoscave: It was difficult to leave silver
 struct: They are completely different games too
 Nerchio: i know i find ghost in a cell much harder so far..
 Nerchio: 2d grid feels very natural to me
 Nerchio: and this not so much
 Nerchio: zenos you are gold+ in ghost in a cell?
 Zenoscave: anyone do simu in legend&#160;?
 Zenoscave: and yes nerchio
 Nerchio: i like the new leaderboard
 Nerchio: i mean i dont see much change but its ok ;p
 MSmits: ghost in the cell is not exactly harder
 MSmits: you just need a different skillset
 MSmits: people are good at different things
 MSmits: Zenoscave illedan has a GA I think
 MSmits: for GITC
 MSmits: also everyone has a simulation in some way, but not everyone has a search
 MSmits: people confuse sim and search. Sim is just simulating what is going to happen if you do "X".  Pretty sure even the heuristics bots have some form of that. Search is making it systematic, more complete and more calculation intensive
 Nerchio: someone said that ghost in a cell has too many possibilities to do a real GA i think
 Nerchio: not sure
 Nerchio: you played it msmits?
 MSmits: yeah, i just have a heuristic bot that wasnt particularly good
 MSmits: but got to gold with it
 MSmits: this was a long time ago thoguh
 MSmits: when i was on cg for maybe a month or two
 Nerchio: I wasn't sure if i like ghost in the cell but right now i kind of enjoy it
 Nerchio: i hope i will like pacman too
 icecream17: ooh. just took a look at ghost in the cell - looks awesome
 AntiSquid: watch the anime, it's even better
 MSmits: weeb
 AntiSquid: ghost in the shell stand alone complex
 Nerchio: anime :nerd:
 AntiSquid: i mean if you can't enjoy a story because of the format, then you have issues imo, you raise barriers you shouldn't have to deal with
 AntiSquid: there's the live action movie but it's nowhere as good: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4VmJcZR0Yg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4VmJcZR0Yg</a>

 BenjaminUrquhart: also that's one thicc link
 BenjaminUrquhart: console.log(players.me) // { factories: [], bots: [], total: [Function: total] }
 AntiSquid: right inner should be able to know about outer
 cegprakash: icecream17 did u promote me overnight
 icecream17: You were still at 2 last time I checked. But then in the morning you were gone from the leaderboard mysteriously.
 cegprakash: haha
 cegprakash: definitely Crog
 cegprakash: if not you
 cegprakash: he is #3 now
 cegprakash: he is also improving
 cegprakash: almost there
 AntiSquid: maybe someone already promoted to gold&#160;?
 cegprakash: AntiSquid I may not go to legend
 cegprakash: but I'll definitely rekt you
 AntiSquid: that's what life is all about is it?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: u blame it on the life then
 cegprakash: after I rekt u
 AntiSquid: the galaxy is astounded 
 AntiSquid: lol i don't care about your life
 AntiSquid: beating a bugged bot isn't something to brag about
 cegprakash: I like gold and legend leagues beccause I don't have to read problem statements anymore
 AntiSquid: do you ever read them?
 cegprakash: just the 3 lines
 cegprakash: about the change
 cegprakash: not full statement
 cegprakash: usually when I promote I just play a game with boss
 cegprakash: and assume what the new skill is doing
 cegprakash: and start coding
 AntiSquid: did i hurt your feelings really really badly?
 cegprakash: not now
 cegprakash: not yet
 cegprakash: you are the one angry on me
 cegprakash: i love u
 cegprakash: i love wrecking u
 AntiSquid: gay
 icecream17: There should be a "find obscure bugs" contest. Or "send obscure bugs". Whoever's bug is the hardest to figure out wins....
 cegprakash: what about the dev who makes bugs that are hard to figure
 cegprakash: do they get a prize? if so I'm up
 cegprakash: whatever I write is very hard to debug definitely
 cegprakash: I'm just implementing a damage map AntiSquid
 cegprakash: after that I plan to add self trackking
 cegprakash: once I add these I rekt you
 AntiSquid: dude you sounds mildly retarded
 cegprakash: why
 cegprakash: what's the use of all the coding without bragging
 AntiSquid: first of all i don't care
 AntiSquid: stop pinging me
 cegprakash: lolz
 cegprakash: okay
 cegprakash: I go ez on u
 AntiSquid: do what you want, reach legend if you can
 icecream17: How do you change your settings again (like fontsize of ide code)
 icecream17: Oh yeah! Promote to wood2 (ghost in the cell)
 cegprakash: why not continue OOC icecream17
 cegprakash: u are so close to promote
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454343697">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454343697</a>
 cegprakash: turn 43 u have bug
 cegprakash: it's better to go into the choke point instead of using SURFACE
 icecream17: Oops.. an Error Occured
 cegprakash: I send screenshot where u bug
 icecream17: Also, "available" only contains spaces with... hey wait a minute!
 icecream17: I could add another array of spaces that are deadends...
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/ctSQhWc">https://ibb.co/ctSQhWc</a>
 cegprakash: next turn u use SURFACE and charge TORPEDO
 cegprakash: but better move is going south
 cegprakash: and ur firing accuracy seem to be bad as well
 cegprakash: these two fixes should take u gold
 PeaceMoreZ: Isn't the 'smallest code' clash slightly unfair?
 theroot99: hello, how can i know how is start first in the last challeng?
 cegprakash: you choose it
 cegprakash: upto you
 cegprakash: you can print any position in the board and u spawn there theroot99
 cegprakash: I think this was done so that game is not symmetrical as well as fair for both players
 theroot99: i think randomly&#160;?
 cegprakash: random is good enough
 cegprakash: until Bronze
 cegprakash: where u need to add 1 extra condition
 cegprakash: for now just don't spawn on an island or u die instantly
 barberk2206: Where can I go on this website to learn Java?
 MSmits: this website assumes you know java, or at least the basics. You go here to practice coding, not learn a language
 barberk2206: Oh okay thanks
 MSmits: np, and gn&#160;:)
 barberk2206: gn&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: 1 less CG user
 ZarthaxX: gj MSmits&#160;:)
 icecream17: wait... what? *dun dun*
 icecream17: I pushed someone above the boss in ghost in the cell wood2
 icecream17: 2nd place? Sigh
 MadKnight: hey hey icecream17
 icecream17: hi
 MadKnight: show your replay
 MadKnight: are u still in wood2&#160;?
 icecream17: yes

 icecream17: not a very good replay...
 icecream17: codingame.com/share-replay/454353837
 MadKnight: which one is your new code&#160;?
 icecream17: both
 MadKnight: why do they play so differently&#160;?
 icecream17: Not really. Just attack when numBots - otherNumBots &gt; 40
 icecream17: They always send 7 somehow
 icecream17: When get factory owned by "noone" just send a third of NumBots
 icecream17: Oops, a third is for attacking. I menat a seventh.
 MadKnight: &gt; numBots - otherNumBots &gt; 40nonono u need to learn to protect your factories first so that enemy can't take them over then attack with all your free troops 
 icecream17: send all troops but protect.... okay
 MadKnight: all free* troops
 MadKnight: free troops are those that are not used to repel current attacks
 MadKnight: for example if u got 10 troops coming towards your factory then u gotta make sure your factory has 10 troops by the time they come
 MadKnight: if u got more than 10 then use all of them
 MadKnight: except for the 10
 MadKnight: also account for troops in nearest enemy factories
 icecream17: Oh. I'll just subtract the total, but divide by 1.1 only.
 MadKnight: what is that magic numbe
 MadKnight: r
 MadKnight: is that like 3vel in CSB&#160;?
 icecream17: I divide by 3 (originally) so that I don't send all of my troops.
 icecream17: What is 3vel?
 MadKnight: magic formula that gets u to gold
 MadKnight: ezpz gold
 MostComplicatedUsername: Na
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well yeah
 stacked: 3vel?
 MostComplicatedUsername: But it's not the best
 MadKnight: MostComplicatedMagicFormul
 MadKnight: a
 MadKnight: stacked are u interested&#160;?
 MostComplicatedUsername: You should change it depending on location
 icecream17: oooh. But I never made it to gold before so....
 stacked: yea, but im really a noob
 MadKnight: gogogo gold
 MadKnight: u can do -3vel stacked
 MadKnight: u too icecream17
 stacked: whats that mean?
 icecream17: idk
 stacked: idek what that is 
 MadKnight: subtract 3 velocities from checkpoint
 stacked: ohhh
 icecream17: huh? velocities?
 MadKnight: it's like speed but a vector
 MadKnight: directional speed
 icecream17: Oh. My bronze csb code doesn't calculate that yet.
 icecream17: Only in middle school math so I don't understnad
 MadKnight: it's easy just divide distance by time but in 2d
 MadKnight: 2d distance by time
 MadKnight: distance vector
 MadKnight: movement vector
 icecream17: I know distance, but how direction?
 icecream17: Oh.
 MostComplicatedUsername: what you do it
 MostComplicatedUsername: is*
 stacked: it's like an x and y lol
 icecream17: My CSB code is just a couple ifs. That's it.
 MostComplicatedUsername: print (f'{targetx - 3 * velX} {targety - 3 * velY} {throttle}')
 MostComplicatedUsername: THats what you do ^
 stacked: this man out here giving code
 stacked: lol
 icecream17: X - prevX = velX
 icecream17: Python is better than js at code golf. JS uses console.log() instead of print
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 ban MostComplicatedUsername
 Automaton2000: have to go to the top
 icecream17: Automaton2000 I didn't know you were in A* Craft!
 Automaton2000: are you doing atm marchete?
 icecream17: Huh? Atm marchete?
 MostComplicatedUsername: atm = at the moment
 MostComplicatedUsername: (or) automatic teller machine
 MadKnight: or AuToMaton
 MadKnight: icecream17 are u doing the -3vel now&#160;?
 icecream17: no still on ghost in the cell
 MadKnight: try -3vel 
 MadKnight: real quick
 MostComplicatedUsername: Automaton2000 ban MadKnight
 Automaton2000: so you have to do in the first place?
 MostComplicatedUsername: No you have to do it Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: my rank is going to be like this
 icecream17: auTOMATOn2000 how do you type so fast
 Automaton2000: do you like it so far
 MadKnight: are u a tomato Automaton2000&#160;?

 MadKnight: what kind of weird behavior
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 if i break my ordering function is it a weird behavior&#160;?
 Automaton2000: rust is compiled in release mode
 MadKnight: tjadli
 Guillermo.: Hallo
 MadKnight: ollaH
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 do people still act normally when u can come up with ways to make it more interesting?
 Automaton2000: i mean to say that the rest of the day
 MadKnight: yes Automaton2000 just like children do
 Automaton2000: makes me want to puke
 MadKnight: but better
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 oh come on dude
 Automaton2000: so u can just use the same thing
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why do some people from russia pronouce 'dude' like it's actually diuade&#160;?
 Automaton2000: it is alright, i appreciate the help
 MadKnight: with i like in 'ding'
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 ding&#160;?
 Automaton2000: u can also ask others to share their solutions so u can use a ga
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why do u need others solutions to use a ga
 Automaton2000: but do you compute log(parentvisits) for every children? or just once and just put the value there
 magaiti: Automaton2000, you can cache log(x) 
 Automaton2000: python is a good idea
 jacek: :O

 issogood: hi all, i was wondering about the code golf pwer of thor solutions in the leaderboard, i have one too, in js, which i don't see how it could be made shorter, but then the leaderboards show some that have just over 50 chars, which i find a bit extreme. are they real or some form of cheat?
 jrke: real
 Mittzir: hi all, I've been away for a while, but can I see my source code from past contests?

 [CG]ROBIN: hi
 Uljahn: that name tag :rolling_eyes:
 kb_noah_flynn: hi
 [CG]ROBIN: yeah UIjahn
 MaxGumieniczek: hello?
 Uljahn: robin, i suggest you to rethink your nickname to not mislead anybody to idea that you're one of CG admins, thanks
 [CG]ROBIN: okk UIjahn i respect you so i will listen to you
 Robin_Hood: Hey it okk now
 Uljahn: nice
 Robin_Hood: what why my name is not changed 
 Uljahn: need to refresh the page
 Robin_Hood: okk
 Robin_Hood: UIjahn why your avatar is a cat
 Uljahn: hmm, that doesn't work but i see your new nick by hovering over the avatar
 alpha..: 
 Uljahn: i think i have some personality traits in common with that particular cat :slight_smile:
 Robin_Hood: nice
 Wontonimo: i'm surprised there isn't a restriction with starting your name with [CG] 
 Robin_Hood: what you want to say about me Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: help me out, if you tell me your insecurities first then my response is guaranteed to be funnier
 Robin_Hood: are you DISHONOR me
 BlaiseEbuth: Robin_Hood&#160;! Welcome back&#160;!
 Robin_Hood: thanks 
 Astrobytes: ...
 Robin_Hood: BlaiseEbuth
 Robin_Hood: hii Astrobytes
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do you "..." Astrobytes&#160;? CG is a big family, we are all friends here&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Ah sorry, I forgot.Great big hug for Robin_Hood
 Robin_Hood: i think he is not happy because i came back BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: You see&#160;! :hugging:
 Robin_Hood: lol too late i write something else
 Robin_Hood: guys i make a contribution for a reverse mode of Clash of Code
 Astrobytes: I hope you nicely used your brain to constrate.
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 now i need to look up what does "constrate" mean
 Automaton2000: ok so it's not always the best
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop people from using words i don't know
 Automaton2000: well then i hope ican tye fast enough
 Astrobytes: It's not a word, it's a meme
 MadKnight: never seen it
 MadKnight: gimme
 Robin_Hood: what about my contribution
 alpha..: Automaton2000  say hi
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 how do people know about memes that i don't know about&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i go for the big board
 Automaton2000: do i have to improve my bot
 MadKnight: [CG]ROBIN why are u [CG}
 MadKnight: i feel like actual admins are gonna ask u to remove that from your nick
 MadKnight: i think it's already happened once or twice
 Robin_Hood: i remove it because i don't no it is not for players or coders MadKnight
 MadKnight: oh u did already lol
 MadKnight: well we gotta refresh the chat for it to update
 MadKnight: but i have no idea what u just said
 Robin_Hood: I don't know also that what i said lol :smile:
 MadKnight: nevermind that
 MadKnight: tell me what did u say
 Robin_Hood: noo comments to my contribution lol :disappointed:
 MadKnight: what's your contri
 Robin_Hood: can i paste a link here
 MadKnight: well i just asked 
 MadKnight: so u can just paste it as a response
 MadKnight: u got luckuy
 Robin_Hood: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/629925dddb0aaf6c2aa77d0449f9cf1c6738">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/629925dddb0aaf6c2aa77d0449f9cf1c6738</a>
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i said lucky
 Robin_Hood: this one
 Automaton2000: at least i got the code to make it hard to understand
 MadKnight: wow Automaton2000 so many words in the description
 Automaton2000: only need to be a lot of great software people. ms should be so much easier
 MadKnight: Goalget the answser.
 MadKnight: no way someone will have questions for the details of that, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: hi, can somebody help me
 MadKnight: no way i know what it means that my edge is 1
 MadKnight: wait no
 MadKnight: i ruiled that
 MadKnight: ruined
 MadKnight: nevermind
 Robin_Hood: hey u read about cube
 Robin_Hood: in math
 MadKnight: what i wanna say is i don't know what it means that edge=1
 MadKnight: does it mean my edge is in the shape of 1&#160;?
 Robin_Hood: comon it is A line segment formed where two edges meet. A cube has 12 edges. Because all faces are squares and congruent to each other, all 12 edges are the same length.
 MadKnight: so okay i have it at 1 so i know i got like
 MadKnight: hmmm
 MadKnight: 1x1 like 6 times
 MadKnight: i feel like there are already CoC's that are really similar to this
 MadKnight: are u sure it's actually unique&#160;?
 MadKnight: at least i know for sure there's a puzzle that's really similar to this
 Robin_Hood: what it is already exits lol i don't if it is exits  
 MadKnight: u gotta check for that
 Robin_Hood: okk it times to go bye
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community?mode=accepted&amp;type=clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community?mode=accepted&amp;type=clashofcode</a>
 Robin_Hood: MadKnight
 Robin_Hood: or other member
 MadKnight: so here's a list of all CoC's
 MadKnight: &gt; okk it times to go bye 
 Automaton2000: i don't know for sure
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u gotta time it
 Automaton2000: still better than the boss! you will be able to read it
 Joseph_Mother: Good morning crackasses
 Uljahn: and i take it personally :shrug:
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we have to come up with a cool joke here
 Automaton2000: there is no reason to make a good bot for it
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 all i come up with is just dumb, gimme some ideas
 Automaton2000: i'm done with my studies
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 that doesn't give me any ideas that are not just terrible
 Automaton2000: what language do you use a book, do you only have to be an improvement
 Astrobytes: jeez give it a rest with pinging the bot
 MadKnight: recurs was also like that
 MadKnight: i just ping him 2-3 times and it starts feeling like i spammed the entire #world
 MadKnight: not recurs i mean by pinging him of
 MadKnight: ofc
 MadKnight: hmm Automaton2000 i need to rephrase that, that went out terribly
 Automaton2000: that's how i understood it
 MadKnight: nevermind
 MadKnight: not important
 MadKnight: Astrobytes what i mean is - if i ping Automaton2000 like 3 times it already seems like i spammed the entire #world with that
 Automaton2000: a lot of possible moves
 MadKnight: look i just pinged Automaton2000 for the 3rd time and it already seems like the entire world is spammed
 Automaton2000: this time it was my problem
 MadKnight: yes it is your problem, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i thought zero was just that it is the easiest
 MadKnight: stop responding and making spam, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: just wait for the end
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 cancelled
 Automaton2000: took some time to write a recursive function
 JLukeSkywalker: when do we get fortran on here?
 MadKnight: umm
 MadKnight: ask the forum discussion about adding new language to the platform
 MadKnight: they probably had it covered
 JLukeSkywalker: people have suggested, but there was no feedback either positive or nevgative
 Westicles: I just imagine all the CG guys in a meeting, and poor Thib has to say the rabble want Fortran and they all laugh
 Farhan_Sadiq: Hi
 Farhan_Sadiq: :grinning:
 AntiSquid: assembler and Lisp duh
 Uljahn: i think there is gfortran compiler already installed as a part of gcc, but i had problems with calling it from numpy
 Westicles: Yep, this runs in bash
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ffc841e-a0dc-4609-81a8-d6942ffb992d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ffc841e-a0dc-4609-81a8-d6942ffb992d</a>
 Uljahn: neat
 HunterEhrenfeld: I am so grateful for this website
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 TBali: Wow,  so the mother of all programming languages is supported 'below the counter'?It would be a fun tribute to computing history to let it supported officially. Anly stub generators need to be written, no?
 TBali: *Anly = only
 HunterEhrenfeld: also, anyone wanna be friends so i can have competition on the leaderboards lol
 JLukeSkywalker: you can add me
 HunterEhrenfeld: added!&#160;:)
 JLukeSkywalker: now u gotta try to catch up&#160;;)
 HunterEhrenfeld: i can try lol
 JLukeSkywalker: once you start doing some of the bot and opti competitions, your score can skyrocket
 jacek: what game
 JLukeSkywalker:&#160;?
 Alshock: TBali there's no tribute here, if a language is used it's worth working to make it available, if it's not used, it's not worth it. Now would Fortran actually be used? Ofc no
 JLukeSkywalker: i use it professionally, and would use it on here
 Astrobytes: Fortran is a widely used language Alsh
 Astrobytes: Alshock 
 HunterEhrenfeld: Fortran is still widely used?
 HunterEhrenfeld: Im not even sure what Fortran syntax looks like lol
 JLukeSkywalker: it is still, to this day one of the fastest computational languages
 Astrobytes: Sure. In scientific, financial and engineering fields for starters (not including legacy systems)
 JLukeSkywalker: My college was doing black hole research, so I wrote a bunch of fortran for it. I would say 60% of the code was fortran, 40% was python
 JohnathanBarbee: Okay. I'm having an issue that I can't seem to google. I'm playing UTTT and I'm using BitArrays to store board states. I cannot for the life of me set the Bitarray to any other value after it is setup. What the heck.
 JLukeSkywalker: have you accidentally used an immutable data type?
 JohnathanBarbee: Forgot to mention c#
 JohnathanBarbee: I'm pretty sure they are mutable
 AntiSquid: Poker chip race imo is very similar to pool JLukeSkywalker
 JLukeSkywalker: i guess it is in an odd way
 AntiSquid: it has enough differences though to be approved
 AntiSquid: do snooker :P
 mrdoctor: hello
 AntiSquid: hi
 HunterEhrenfeld: hello
 MohZaib-Ali: Hello
 MohZaib-Ali: Help Me Hhhh
 MohZaib-Ali: OK
 MohZaib-Ali: I'm A Pythoneer
 AntiSquid: maybe there should be a guideline somewhere what people like
 AntiSquid: take this with a grain of salt though, it's not a guideline for quality / fun, do what you enjoy
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i think it defenitely isnt at the top of my list, was just throwing the idea out there
 HunterEhrenfeld: Luke is GOATed
 AntiSquid: hey HunterEhrenfeld are you having class?&#160;:)
 HunterEhrenfeld: I am not in class at the moment. This is my last semester of classes though!
 AntiSquid: nvm
 jacek: struct also has no class
 JLukeSkywalker: a struct is a class
 jacek: impossibru
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 has class
 Automaton2000: i had some problems with it
 HunterEhrenfeld: i have no class
 AntiSquid: ya you told us HunterEhrenfeld ... i just thought you are in class with a bunch of people, seen the 2 no avatars posting same time as you, that's all
 AntiSquid: was about to ask you what kind of game your colleagues would like to see on this site 
 AntiSquid: but nvm .#
 HunterEhrenfeld: im trying to get people at my school to battle me in clash of code lol
 JLukeSkywalker: i cant get any friends to get on here
 JLukeSkywalker:&#160;:(
 HunterEhrenfeld: ^^
 JLukeSkywalker: I even tried bribing with cookies
 HunterEhrenfeld: your friends must suck lol
 JLukeSkywalker: we just all have jobs now, so everyone is kinda busy
 HunterEhrenfeld: or that... lol
 JLukeSkywalker: and i unfortunately didnt find this site till after college
 HunterEhrenfeld: my college friends all graduated a semester early, so im alone now and i just found this site
 Niicide: cool
 Niicide: try AdventofCode
 Niicide: thats really fun too
 Astrobytes: Lots of people on here do AOC
 PrivateTopHat_dcad: do anyone knows how to solve the Hanoi tower game in java&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: I think the idea is that you have to figure that out by yourself...
 jacek: oO
 JLukeSkywalker: c++ is a Point class that compares the distance between itself and another point faster than a function that gets the distance between 2 point objects?
 Astrobytes: Not sure if it's faster or not but it's definitely more convenient to build it into your Point class
 Astrobytes: int distance(const Point&amp; p) etc
 JLukeSkywalker: i have versions of both i could paste in
 JLukeSkywalker: just havnt really used c++ professionally in years
 JLukeSkywalker: and ive kind of hit the python ceiling on here
 Astrobytes: Well no matter what, you'll have to try really damn hard to make your  C++ slower than python&#160;:)
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 HunterEhrenfeld: does my code save? Like, if im doing a problem, will my code still be here the next time i log on
 JLukeSkywalker: once you play anything, it saves
 JLukeSkywalker: i think it actually gives a warning if you try to leave without playing after making changes
 Astrobytes: Yeah it does
 HunterEhrenfeld: im new to python so i keep declaring the variable types and getting errors lol
 JLukeSkywalker: you will get used to it
 Astrobytes: yeah, took me ages to get used to the lack of curly braces lol
 HunterEhrenfeld: for some reason, thats not an issue for me. which is really weird lol
 JLukeSkywalker: I use python and C all the time for work, sometimes simultaneously, so I unfortunately got used to it fast
 JLukeSkywalker: head still hurts sometimes though
 Astrobytes: Switching between the 2 frequently can be a bit of a headspin
 JLukeSkywalker: what would be the 2 worst languages to alternate between?
 HunterEhrenfeld: anything and bash lol
 Astrobytes: Hmm, quite subjective. 
 Astrobytes: I guess having to do Java and C# would be somewhat annoying.
 reCurse: I just barfed
 Astrobytes: Heh
 reCurse: You're right though, having to deal with two similar yet different languages would be very annoying
 Astrobytes: And I'm not sure you could compare different paradigms either, like you're in a different headspace if you're working with a functional language for example
 MSmits: so true, i am doing a  FP course atm
 MSmits: unbelievably different way to code
 Astrobytes: Enjoying it?
 JLukeSkywalker: I think swapping between R and pretty much any C derivative would suck
 MSmits: yeah i like it, but it's so weird
 Astrobytes: Different way of thinking and working for sure
 MSmits: first lesson: Yeah so there are no variables. Everything is a constant
 Astrobytes: Between R and anything I think JLukeSkywalker
 JLukeSkywalker: I've never had to program functionally except 1 class I took, but I've done it for fun, and its pretty cool
 JLukeSkywalker: R varaibles are so awkward, and its 1 indexing, not 0
 Astrobytes: Yes, very annoying. Very powerful though.
 MSmits: I like the fact that it is more mathematical. 
 MSmits: there is no x = x  + 2
 Astrobytes: Yeah, on the one hand it's a very simple and pure way of doing things, but it requires mental gymnastics to get used to actually doing (for me at least :D )
 MSmits: for me too
 MSmits: I have a feeling that if you wrote a bot in a FP language here it would be horribly slow
 MSmits: supposedly FP is better for parallellization
 MSmits: but we dont have that so..
 reCurse: Each layer of abstraction adds more rope to hang yourself with.
 MSmits: yeah
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, ive used it for parallel code, and its cool. you just dont have to worry about like locking out variables and stuff
 JLukeSkywalker: its really not any 'better' it just makes it harder to make mistakes and easier to catch them
 JLukeSkywalker: i guess some people call that better
 jacek: MSmits there is c4 boss now and it seems almost ready to submit
 JLukeSkywalker: do the bots we used stay when it is approved, or do we have to re-do it?
 jacek: no
 jacek: ahh yes
 jacek: when it is approved
 jacek: so copy paste it now somewhere if you want to keep it
 JLukeSkywalker: my c4 one is stupid, so i dont care, but yeah, will have to copy-paste some others
 zhydox: jhgk
 kaffarell: fhasjdfh
 AntiSquid: why
 loberhauser: fguzfffof
 eulerscheZahl: stop it or kick
 loberhauser: sry
 loberhauser: are a german kollege?
 Getter22: wtf
 AntiSquid: #de for get
 AntiSquid: ger *
 Astrobytes: they're Italian
 Astrobytes: I believe they were asking if euler was from a German college
 AntiSquid: i thought restaurants in italy opened up
 eulerscheZahl: Kollege = colleague, co-worker
 eulerscheZahl: but also buddy in slang
 AntiSquid: Zimmer Kollege
 Astrobytes: meh, well, I was half-right :P
 loberhauser: nein wir sprechen fließend deutsch
 kaffarell: enk schickts jo
 eulerscheZahl: ich auch. dafür haben wir #de
 AntiSquid: why didn't you capitalize deutsch then
 loberhauser: ich hatte nie die möglichkeit die sprache zu ändern oder #it zu #de
 eulerscheZahl: just click the #de to join the channel
 AntiSquid: you can change your country of residence in your profile for that
 AntiSquid: i mean to change the default channel
 Astrobytes: ^
 loberhauser: thx @antisquid
 AntiSquid: i've been avoiding #de all this time, frequented fr and ru more often :D
 AntiSquid: #de is dead o.o
 JLukeSkywalker: :eyes: all this time I thought my botters of the galaxy code just sucked
 JLukeSkywalker: it advanced a league and just errors now
 JLukeSkywalker: never noticed
 eulerscheZahl: #de is not dead. it even has a scrollbar again
 Astrobytes: OK I'm impressed with that fact!
 reCurse: Come chat with us, we even have a scroll bar.
 AntiSquid: which league are you in Luke&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: wood
 JLukeSkywalker: :laughing:
 Astrobytes: lol reCurse
 JLukeSkywalker: it got to the point where you have to pick 2 heroes, and just died
 JLukeSkywalker: i thought it just only made it that far and gave up 
 loberhauser: does the codingame extension for intellij editors work?
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: is any Windows free app people here use to make fancy titles/logos. 
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 jacek: paint
 Scarfield: ^
 darkhorse64: I know it's JBM favorite tools but I want more
 JLukeSkywalker: fire alpaca is pretty good
 Astrobytes: gimp?
 darkhorse64: I was thinking of something that takes a text and add fancy effects to it
 Astrobytes: It has plenty features like that
 Astrobytes: gimp that is
 JLukeSkywalker: i miss word art
 reCurse: gimp has horrible, horrible UX
 reCurse: I heard good things about kryta
 Astrobytes: Sadly true 
 reCurse: Ok wrong name, trying to find it
 Astrobytes: krita
 reCurse: krita
 Astrobytes: Interesting, haven't seen that one before
 Astrobytes: Definitely familiar looking enough to be usable quickly
 Astrobytes: (coming from PS or whatever)
 struct: Even to create a circle on GIMP I had to use google
 struct: For very simple stuff I use paint net
 Astrobytes: don't they charge for paint net these days
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 struct: only if you download from microsoft store
 struct: from their website is free
 Astrobytes: krita looks way cool actually, very art-centric, gonna recommend this to my mate actually
 Astrobytes: -1 actually
 Astrobytes: struct: ah ok
 Astrobytes: meh, my mate has krita already. fwiw he recommends it (does flyer/poster designs etc)
 reCurse: I mostly know because of artists at work
 Astrobytes: Makes sense. It seems really impressive.
 Scarfield: damn yea, looks very nice. But its not Paint
 Astrobytes: BitmapField
 Wontonimo: I've tried using sketchbook (on mac).  It's quite nice but I'm no artist and it doesn't magically change that.
 jacek: lets wait for more generative NNs then
 darkhorse64: OK. Thanks for the advice
 Scarfield: adobe flash had some nice text effect iirc
 Scarfield: AstroClobber
 JohnathanBarbee: Is there an easy way to test my code offline for better debugging?
 JohnathanBarbee: I'm playing UTTT and the console is just reporting generic errors.
 tibithegreat: well you can copy paste your code locally and see if it runs or not
 tibithegreat: are you getting compile or runtime errors?
 JohnathanBarbee: runtime
 NOTsteve: when creating a puzzle, is my solution that I provide supposed to include the readlines and stuff or should I leave that out and allow the stub generator to do it?
 tibithegreat: mm I had runtime errors with UTTT as well actually
 tibithegreat: mostly it was accessing memory out of bounds and stuff like that
 tibithegreat: but in my case it was wrongly reported as "program took too long"
 tibithegreat: but in fact it crashed
 tibithegreat: I usually just commented code around until I figured out what I messed up
 JohnathanBarbee: Mine is nothing too complex. Argument out of range. Simple fix, but it doesn't point me to where it failed. Just that it failed
 tibithegreat: well you can copy your program locally
 tibithegreat: and just automate it to execute the moves your opponent did
 Astrobytes: I assume you're outputting debug info to stderr?
 JohnathanBarbee: Yes
 JohnathanBarbee: I think. I'm not sure what that is exactly
 Astrobytes: Console.Error() or whatever it is in C#
 JohnathanBarbee: Yes. I do that
 Astrobytes: Right cool
 Papaver: Hello world&#160;:)
 NOTsteve: Astrobytes, any help on my earlier question about contributions? It would be greatly appreciated&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You can copy the inputs given and read them in locally to test
 Astrobytes: NOTsteve: your solution should be as it would be in the IDE if you were solving any other puzzle
 Astrobytes: ^ resolved&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: JohnathanBarbee: further to my last comment, I mean you can read them in via text file or whatever in VS to check your sim/search
 tibithegreat: or just embed them in an array in your code
 Astrobytes: yeah, whatever is convenient
 JohnathanBarbee: I might try doing that. Thanks
 Astrobytes: Also unit test your methods, it helps
 Astrobytes: You don't need to use a fancy framework or anything, just make sure they do what you expect
 jacek: unit what?
 Astrobytes: Sorry, I meant write 1500 loc and worry later
 MSmits: works for me
 Astrobytes: yeah yeah
 Astrobytes: :P
 Scarfield: just noticed my bot thought my pawns could teleport attack on the edges, forgot about masks for them, unit test ftw
 AntiSquid: face masks for chess pieces?
 Astrobytes: I seem to remember MSmits having a teleporting issue in OOC
 Scarfield: i prefere my pawns pretty
 Scarfield: prefer*
 Astrobytes: Masks on pawns? That's almost pawnographic.
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Softcore pawn.
 jacek: pawns? breakthrough?
 Scarfield: chess960
 jacek: ahh, chess has pawns too.
 MSmits: i did have a teleporting issue in ooc, in that my sub would not teleport
 Scarfield: chess69 has pawnstars
 MSmits: tried everything
 MSmits: no go
 Scarfield: bitboard ooc? wasnt that 15x15 or something
 Scarfield: int per row or how?
 jacek: int256
 MadKnight: Astrobytes what's OOC&#160;?
 jacek: smitsiint
 Scarfield: ocean of code MK
 jacek: Scarfield what's MK?
 MadKnight: Modular KSI
 MadKnight: of course
 Scarfield: multi kill (?)
 MadKnight: Mario Kart
 MadKnight: Monster Kid, a character from the video game Undertale
 Scarfield: yes, thats the one
 Astrobytes: OOC  was the lockdown contest MK
 Astrobytes: before the official spring 2020 one
 MadKnight: &gt;Megakelvin (MK), an SI unit of temperaturehmm that makes more sense
 MadKnight: didn't see the lockdown contest
 Astrobytes: Think there was an email, can't remember. Was high on painkillers those months lol
 Scarfield: oh, your back is better now?
 Astrobytes: Nope.
 Scarfield: sad, hoped that was implied&#160;:/
 MadKnight: what's up with your back&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Not quite as awful but I'm still severely limited. Spoke with my physiotherapist yesterday and scans are still backlogged until before my referral last year (the bone density scan)
 Astrobytes: I take the fewest pain meds I can though.
 Astrobytes: But for free movement I have to take them now and then.
 Astrobytes: MadKnight: I had/have multiple fractures in my spine, suspected osteoporosis (I'm a bit young for that condition)
 MadKnight: sounds pretty bad
 Astrobytes: Well I'm not dying or anything so could be worse. Anyway, don't worry about it.
 MadKnight: oke
 MadKnight: got a link to OOC&#160;?

 MadKnight: yea
 MadKnight: and i used my fancy lib with my cool fancy BFS for that
 MadKnight: to eval the map

 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a code in the contest in contests?
 JBM: my aunt sent me her CCCP phto album
 JBM: man it goes WAY back
 MadKnight: jacek why did u ping euler for no reason
 jacek: not me eh
 MadKnight: well u pinged NN one
 JBM: "i didnn't know it back then, i was a MAJOR problem to our guide -- no way to mic tents"
 MadKnight: u know he pings euler even more often than he says "oui" in fr
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is it weird than the most used word in #fr is oui while in here it's euler&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i like to play with it
 MadKnight: for the NN
 MadKnight: oui == yes
 jacek: he likes to play with oui oui?
 MadKnight: who doesn't?
 MSmits: I wonder who said that 
 Astrobytes: ...
 MSmits: wasnt me
 Astrobytes: Like the guy who stopped for a French hitchhiker, asked if he needed a ride, reply was "oui oui oui!", guy says "not in my car you don't" and drives off.
 MadKnight: lol
 MadKnight: i actually thought of the wii platform firsyt
 Astrobytes: I think that joke is older than me.
 jacek: "man addicted to drinking brake fluid claims he can stop anytime he wants"
 Astrobytes: yeah, also a golden oldie
 MSmits: makes sense
 Astrobytes: The man who stands on the toilet gets high on pot.
 MSmits: lol 
 MSmits: keep them coming
 AntiSquid: that's a new level of toilet humour
 Astrobytes: groan!
 Astrobytes: (good though!)
 MSmits: nice one
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I think the castling rules are different
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/1WMf9MM">https://imgur.com/a/1WMf9MM</a>
 jacek: i havent done castling for 960 yet
 jacek: theyre tricky
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's complex
 Astrobytes: Compared to regular castling
 struct: how is it complex?
 Astrobytes: *more complicated
 jacek: some castlings do nothing
 struct: how does it do nothing?
 jacek: king and rook are already on their target positions
 Scarfield: ah i misinterpretted the rules
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPtbyOOdMcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPtbyOOdMcQ</a>
 Astrobytes: "ecksdee"
 struct: you mean if king and rook are next to eachother?
 jacek: ecksdee? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw3CE04LGiA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw3CE04LGiA</a>
 jacek: ah yeah, when they are next to each other
 jacek: then castling can happen as 1st move
 struct: When they are next to eachother you just switch pieces
 jacek: eeyup
 Scarfield: i thought they simply switch positions for whatever reason, but after castling the pieces will land on the same cells as with normal castling.
 struct: they should only switch if they are next to each other
 Scarfield: Here's an example of the castling that confused me <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/529745456">https://www.codingame.com/replay/529745456</a>
 struct: I think that is wrong
 Scarfield: thats the fisher rules
 Scarfield: but i thought as well
 struct: oh its right

 Astrobytes: yes, what confused you?
 Astrobytes: @struct not ConfusedField

 struct: This is a bit confusing
 struct: Due to
 struct: if you castle left
 struct: it only switches
 struct: if you castle right it moves
 Scarfield: yea, the rule is king and rook has to land on the same cells as with normal chess
 Astrobytes: Blame Bobby
 nassim_laghoub: hiiii
 jacek: lets make new variant, chessfield
 nassim_laghoub: c'est à dire&#160;?
 MSmits: c'est la wrong channel
 jacek: #fr
 Scarfield: coco chanel?
 nassim_laghoub: yes
 Astrobytes: anglais ici, français en #fr
 nassim_laghoub: okay 
 nassim_laghoub: je suis entrain d'écrire en anglais mais ça se traduit automatiquement
 Astrobytes: ...
 nassim_laghoub: what&#160;?
 MSmits: you know Astrobytes, just because you speak the language, doesn't mean you can make people understand you
 nassim_laghoub: Astrobytes&#160;?
 nassim_laghoub: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: You are most definitely not typing english and it suddenly becomes french ffs
 Astrobytes: pdm
 MSmits: private dungeon master?
 nassim_laghoub: je tape bien l'anglais
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Bien sûr
 MSmits: good sir?
 Scarfield: Mr. Bien
 MSmits: ooh right, the French version
 Astrobytes: Zero tolerance today struct&#160;:)
 struct: he checks too many boxes
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 MSmits: oh, you guys have a secret form?
 Scarfield: a warning would have been nice tbh, or are they not needed?
 MSmits: he warned
 MSmits: guy kept speaking French
 Astrobytes: He was warned. Wasn't gonna kick him but level 1, trying to wind us up etc etc
 LiudasStaniulis: does anyone know existing games that are like ghost in cell(one of AI courses)
 Scarfield: i missed it somehow xD
 Astrobytes: MSmits: btw PDM = Putain de merde
 MSmits: ohh, that means damned :poop:
 MSmits: gonna have to warn you to refrain from such fecal language
 Astrobytes: That's a more sfw way of putting it yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah you too, for that jobby emoji
 MSmits: mmh ok

 Wontonimo: what are you trying out in this uttt bot MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: mostly i am checking out dozens of lost/drawn replays to see if it solves correctly
 MSmits: i added another pruning rule
 MSmits: but they are really complicated. Easy to do it wrong
 Astrobytes: what now?
 Astrobytes: (pruning rule I mean)
 MSmits: this one had to do with situations where the player with the highest number of won boards has been determined
 Scarfield: I remember enjoying to read the harry potter books in english when i was learning the language because of the funny curse words. but scottish seem to be on a whole other level cD
 Scarfield: xD * (of course)
 MSmits: in that case, if a miniboard cannot contribute to a line and cant be reached from another board, you should not play a free move there
 MSmits: it's very situational
 Astrobytes: That seems almost a no-brainer MSmits
 Astrobytes: There must be a caveat
 MSmits: how do you mean
 Astrobytes: retract that, I missed your 'very situational' comment
 Astrobytes: Expensive to detect or...?
 MSmits: well it only happens sometimes, mostly when one side has maybe 4 won boards and there are 2 draws or something. then you may end up with 1 board thats isolated and cant be part of a line. It is also required you can't send a player there
 MSmits: sometimes it's useful to be able to send a player to a useless board
 MSmits: so you might not want to win that board, because that ends that
 Astrobytes: Yes, makes sense,
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: You should read some Irvine Welsh
 MSmits: so a lot of ifs and loops to detect
 MSmits: but i dont do it in the sim
 MSmits: just in expansion
 MSmits: together with tons of such pruning rules
 Astrobytes: Well, if the pruning is successful it'll offset any of that stuff anyway. Still an interesting approach.
 jacek: so you basically use prune array
 jacek: what a ripoff
 MSmits: it slows down my bot, but winrate stays the same more or less. I just like solving 
 Astrobytes: HAH
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: here's an example of benefit Astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529752648">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529752648</a>
 MSmits: solved as loss at 38
 MSmits: draw at 44
 MSmits: so i solved  &gt;6 plies sooner than Mealc
 MSmits: somehow he made a mistake on 43, i dont pretend to know what it is, but my bot does&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yes, I had to slow it down for it to make sense but yes I see
 Astrobytes: Feck knows
 MSmits: who's Fecj
 MSmits: Feck
 Astrobytes: Game makes almost no sense other than in a vaguely gamey way
 MSmits: is that another Scottish Poop thing
 Astrobytes: Ask Father Jack
 MSmits: oh, i didnt finish the whole show, but what i did see was fun
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e9Y023-mnc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e9Y023-mnc</a>
 MSmits: oh the old guy in the chair that breaks the TV?
 Astrobytes: Ah go on now MSmits, you'll have to finish it, you will now, go on now
 MSmits: I will at some point :0
 Astrobytes: Yeah the old alcoholic womanising priest is Father Jack, Father Ted is the main character and Father Dougal is his somewhat challenged sidekick
 Scarfield: trainspotting is based on a book :o didnt know that, gonna check his work for sure&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: And Mrs Doyle makes tea and says "go on now"
 MSmits: ah yes
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: not just a book but accurate experiences of scotland in the 80s (also the 90s, and now depending where you live)
 Astrobytes: (other than the obviously dramatised parts)
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Also he writes his books in Scots
 Astrobytes: I think there might be English versions too
 MSmits: did not know Scots is a language
 MSmits: well aside from Jobby and such
 MSmits: hey, is it like how Eskimo people have 100 words for snow or something. Only it's poop. Just wondering
 Scarfield: "whan his mither Mary was mairry't till Joseph"
 RSBat: finally reached legend in uttt. And the thing that pushed me over was just bigger hashmap
 Wontonimo:&#160;!!! Congrats&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: what were you hashing?
 MSmits: nice!
 jacek: or smoking
 Wontonimo: no, seriously.  I'm really curious because I don't have a hashmap of anything for my uttt
 RSBat: stateskey was board bitmap and last move in a miniboard
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: :rofl:
 jacek: using minimax or mcts?
 RSBat: mcts
 Astrobytes: intriguing
 UnnamedCodinGamer: congratulations
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I also did it earlier today
 Wontonimo: you are using that to reduce and reuse boards
 Astrobytes: yeah well done
 Astrobytes: all this uttt s**t, I'm gonna have to actually do it soon right
 jacek: you havent done it? noob
 RSBat: UnnamedCodinGamer congrats, I saw you beat me earlier and your bot is way stronger than mine
 Astrobytes: F off. Almost everything else on the site is more interesting.
 jacek: :soccer:&#160;?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am not sure
 UnnamedCodinGamer: 147 th currenly in legend
 Astrobytes: Possibly even that jacek yeah
 MSmits: Astrobytes you'll easily make legend
 Astrobytes: I don't doubt it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it does around 12k iterations on second turn
 MSmits: RSBat it's really courageous to use a hashmap in uttt, i havent even tried, assuming it will only hurt
 UnnamedCodinGamer: basic uttc with rollouts with board win loss detection seems to do the job
 UnnamedCodinGamer: mcts
 MSmits: I was thinking of maybe trying a hashmap for late game situations
 MSmits: you have more transpositions then
 Astrobytes: vanilla mcts is enough yes
 RSBat: wait, what do you use then? just store a tree?
 Wontonimo: RSBat how many rollouts you clocking?  I bet you don't need as many because of your hashmap
 MSmits: ohh, you had everything in a hashmap and no tree&#160;??
 Astrobytes: wait what
 Wontonimo: ^^
 MSmits: thats awesome lol
 MSmits: that you got to legend with that
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/101bkmo">https://prnt.sc/101bkmo</a>
 Astrobytes: lel
 MSmits: my hat off to you RSBat
 RSBat: actually I rewrote my tree to hashmap mid gold
 MSmits: but in what way is the hashmap useful compared to the tree?
 Wontonimo: is that rave effectively?
 MSmits: not really
 MSmits: to do a hashmap , when you loop over child nodes, you need to do like 9 hash lookups
 MSmits: thats extremely expensive
 MSmits: you might get some transpositions though. In that sense it helps
 RSBat: but yeah, my goal was to reuse positions as much as possible. So I remap won/lost subboards to dedicated masks and store only move in subboard, not whole board
 RSBat: should also remap drawn boards, but dont do it now
 MSmits: remap means you have a simple code for win/loss/draw?
 MSmits: so that you get more transpositions in the late game
 MSmits: a won board is a won board, evne if it has a different layout
 MSmits: thats what you mean right?
 RSBat: yes
 MSmits: i do that in my meta mcts
 MSmits: but it only traverses a meta tree once per game, so it doesnt matter there
 MSmits: if i have to do this 30-100k times it would be super expensive
 MSmits: but I will think more seriously about using it after maybe 5 boards solved or something
 MSmits: 5 boards ended i mean
 Astrobytes: Interesting approach. Stop feeding MSmits RSBat
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 RSBat: basic idea is I precomputed winner for every board mask and use it as lookup table in rollout
 MSmits: what do you mean by a board mask in this case?
 MSmits: do you mean a 18 bit code for the bigboard or something?
 Scarfield: corona guidelines of course
 MSmits: the complete board i mean
 AntiSquid: everyone and their neighbour's dogs using bit masks now? 
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: MaskField
 RSBat: 18 bit for miniboard
 MSmits: wait, so you precompute for miniboards only?
 AntiSquid: i just want to use vectors, recursion and even python, why is life so difficult
 Scarfield: no D?
 AntiSquid: next contest, kept promising myself
 RSBat: yes, there is no way to precompute whole board
 AntiSquid: when is next contest
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: you can also do this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4501a55f-0856-4edf-90b8-08cd00c88b2d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4501a55f-0856-4edf-90b8-08cd00c88b2d</a>
 Scarfield: may 6th it says
 RSBat: thanks, will try that
 MSmits: mark my words, as a surprise, , one week before, they'll move up the date 2 days earlier and do a star wars theme
 MSmits: RSBat it's SimD, you might need some pragmas
 struct: to use that you must enable avx
 Scarfield: i reak that as "mask my words.."
 MSmits: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops", "omit-frame-pointer", "inline")
 Scarfield: read *
 MSmits: that works too
 MSmits: just ignore me
 Astrobytes: masd reak
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: impressive typo
 AntiSquid: is that best combo&#160;? have some many variations, still didn't learn what all the pragmas do
 Astrobytes: decksee
 MSmits: I know most, but not all 
 Scarfield: that could be a scots word
 Astrobytes: It depends what you're using in your code
 AntiSquid: why do you eed rdrnd&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: it has dnd in it, i like dnd
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: you have the Irish band Dexy's Midnight Runners - Decksee
 Astrobytes: "it has dnd in it, i like dnd" - if Smits wrote documentation
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: whats dnd?
 MSmits: dungeond and dragons ofc
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: d = s
 MSmits: well not every d
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: is rdrnd really necessary though?
 MSmits: you'll reason it out struct
 AntiSquid: Scarfield i even thought of a nice theme for avatar / profile for next contest to go along with D lang, hope i won't be too busy again
 Scarfield: were finally gonna compete with alts and guess who's who? 
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 Astrobytes: At least my alt is obvious.
 MSmits: Altrobytes?
 MSmits: Smurfobits?
 Astrobytes: No, but it says "Astrobytes alt account for testing purposes. Does not compete" in the profile
 MSmits: well you should use my suggestions or someone else will
 Astrobytes: That way if I ever really smurf you'll never know :innocent:
 AntiSquid: why alt? i can change avatar for contest lol
 MSmits: true
 struct: Everytme I created a smurf
 struct: I typed here by mistake
 MSmits: me too
 RSBat: so using avx2 pragma slows me down by 2-5k rollouts on second move:sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: hah, see nobody ever found out if i made a smurf
 MSmits: RSBat that shouldnt happen
 reCurse: RSBat Be careful, there are multiple CPU configuration at CG, picked at random
 MSmits: yeah it was an unlucky test
 Astrobytes: Ah that's how we found you out with your other alt struct, I remember
 struct: There are 5 machines I think
 Astrobytes: yeah RSBat, do a series of tests
 struct: or more but with exactly same specs
 Astrobytes: All Haswell, but all? different?
 struct: all haswell yes
 MSmits: whats this: 
 struct: Some have same cpu clock
 MSmits: terminate called after throwing an instance of '__gnu_cxx::recursive_init_error'what(): std::exception
 Scarfield: dont forget about premium users, they have access to better machines
 struct: but different cache size
 RSBat: does it select new machine every time I click "play my code"? or should I reload ide/do sth else?
 Astrobytes: Do you know if this varies over time or is it consistent?
 struct: its random
 struct: What do you mean astro?
 MSmits: recursive_init_error sounds like what happens when reCurse wakes up on the wrong side of the bed
 Astrobytes: Same set of machines over time
 Scarfield: lol
 struct: Ah, I have no idea
 Astrobytes: Or is there variation every few months/weeks etc
 Scarfield: or he keeps waking up from a dream, in a dream
 Astrobytes: MSmits: hah!
 MSmits: or that yeah
 Astrobytes: fails to start all day
 Astrobytes: In that case I think I suffer from recursive_init_errors frequently lol
 reCurse: Or when you submit again on uttt :unamused:
 Astrobytes: that's more of a recursive_damnit_error no?&#160;:)
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Scarfield: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Scarfield: ︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: anyway, unfortunately an early night for me, see you all later, goodnight
 Scarfield: gn :wave:
 reCurse: Bye
 MSmits: gn!
 UnnamedCodinGamer: btw, what is a good way to pick the parameters of mcts?
 reCurse: Prayer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: other than that?
 reCurse: Numerology and validate with a benchmark of 400 games against a reference opponent
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: sounds like trial and error
 reCurse: You're reading me correctly
 reCurse: MSmits Are all of your latest submits deterministic?
 Scarfield: a lot of people here use "CG bench" to test against other bots, i dont have a link though - never used it myself
 UnnamedCodinGamer: well I do not ask specifically for use in CG
 reCurse: Same applies, find a reference benchmark and validate continuously against it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 MSmits: reCurse they're all random mcts bots
 reCurse: I thought you said your new bot is deterministic...
 MSmits: but my CG benchmarks do show me as 40-50% vs you
 MSmits: it was
 MSmits: but this is not my new bot
 MSmits: my new bot failed too much against weaker players
 MSmits: so i used what i learned in my new bot, in my  old bot
 reCurse: Ah
 reCurse: I make a tiny change and it crushes one of your latest then
 MSmits: yeah thats very likely
 reCurse: 91% winrate and mostly different games
 reCurse: Made me wonder
 reCurse: So it explains
 MSmits: there was no book if you're wondering, just eval
 MSmits: havent  had a uttt book in months
 reCurse: I need a more principled way of testing this is getting really dumb
 MSmits: will make one in the future maybe, but just generalized openings, nothing nasty
 Scarfield: you have been going at uttt for months? again :o
 MSmits: weeks now, but a few motnhs ago i had a short run
 MSmits: reCurse from cg benching a lot lately, i did notice uttt has more RPS than i expected. even with random bots. So for testing, you should probabyl just take the entire top 10 and do many more games
 Scarfield: you really fall into rabuttt holes
 MSmits: lol...
 reCurse: This is way too time consuming
 reCurse: I think a more principled way would be to automatically identify and store blunders and validate against them
 reCurse: But fuck this game really
 MSmits: blunders are hard to recognize in uttt, unless you sovle
 struct: stockfish 13 released, +35 elo over sf 12
 reCurse: You could probably measure deviation when giving 10x more time or something
 reCurse: To act as a blunder proxy
 MSmits: reCurse just put it at the bottom of your list, then you havent given up but since your list is always expanding, you're not actually working on it. That's a way to trick yourself psychologically
 reCurse: It's 100% sunken cost
 MSmits: well it's not 100% sunk cost if it's not wasted, you've got a great bot. 
 MSmits: uttt is one of the most active games, you're alwyas gonna have to come back if you reason this way
 MSmits: kar liso is not going to accept you beating him either
 MSmits: he's crazy like you, except he likes the game
 tibithegreat: when people suggest using C instead of C++ on cg, do they mean use the C++ compiler without actual C++ features, or actually use the C compiler?
 reCurse: It means you shouldn't listen
 MSmits: there's no reason to use C unless you like it I think
 tibithegreat: I tried writting in C thinking "how hard can this be, I've been using C++ for a long while"
 Wontonimo: haha
 tibithegreat: and keep hitting all kinda weird "bleah this horrible"
 struct: You should use D
 tibithegreat: fair enough
 reCurse: See, case in point, people say the darndest things
 tibithegreat:&#160;:))
 Wontonimo: what's the main reason people state for C++&#160;?  (I'm just curious, i don't think it'll have merit)
 MSmits: Wontonimo speed
 MSmits: there arent many alternative that can reach the same speed
 Wontonimo: because you don't have to type the "++"&#160;?
 MSmits: probably C and Rust and&#160;???
 reCurse: C# is getting there
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: for the things we do here?
 MSmits: i know speed is relative to the task you're comparing on
 reCurse: Ceres is seriously impressive, dunno about CG
 darkhorse64: stl also makes your life easier
 Westicles: I switched from g++ to clang++ here, it seems it is faster
 MSmits: oh and of course you're talking about unsafe and such 
 reCurse: They did a lot more since
 tibithegreat: yeah the memory management is the first thing I thought of as well
 reCurse: You can get pretty close to bare metal with the latest stuff in .net core
 reCurse: They're taking performance very seriously these days
 tibithegreat: surprising
 MSmits: yeah but, didnt you say this thing about python the other day reCurse
 MSmits: if you're removing all the stuff that makes C# safe
 tibithegreat: C++ seems to be going the other way to me with the latest standards
 MSmits: why not just use C++
 reCurse: Yeah but they're not doing it in a contorted way
 reCurse: It meshes rather well
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: do you use C# for anything reCurse?
 MSmits: at work or?
 reCurse: Used to
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: I still use it for small programs and stuff
 reCurse: Like my own cg bench is in c#
 MSmits: makes sense
 tibithegreat: wouldn't python be better for this kinda stuff?
 reCurse: Or when I have to do some tools at work
 MSmits: if you dont need speed it's better to just use a safer language
 reCurse: I hate python
 reCurse: I don't use it if I don't have to
 tibithegreat: fair enough
 Westicles: For example freecell in other languages would time out with g++, but pass with clang++.  Not sure if it would speed up multis
 MSmits: tibithegreat python has issues too, just like c++, you get different hard to track bugs
 dsheedes: how to complete clash of code in python
 dsheedes: solve()
 MSmits: In C# you have to type a bit more code than in python, but less chance of typing bugs and such
 tibithegreat: MSmits well mostly I use python for really small stuff where I really don't need any kind of performance
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: i would not use it over 300 lines or so
 tibithegreat: so I just code like a retard
 tibithegreat: with no concern for performance, just to make sure it works without bugs
 tibithegreat: like I do the most brute force stuff possible&#160;:))
 MSmits: retard coding is cool
 reCurse: I'm trying to write a web dashboard in python, I question my mental health sometimes
 tibithegreat: very unlikely to have a bug in stuff like that
 tibithegreat: well for web stuff I honestly don't know what other stuff you can do
 tibithegreat: Javascript?
 tibithegreat: I'm not touching that
 reCurse: It's mostly for direct integration with ML stuff
 tibithegreat: php?
 reCurse: But geez
 reCurse: It's like the worst of both worlds
 tibithegreat: usually for this kinda stuff I think it's best to go with the language you are most comfortable with
 reCurse: That's a mistake imo
 tibithegreat: for me it's python mostly because I worked for 3 years in it professionaly
 reCurse: You go with the language offering the best support for what you need
 reCurse: Or, in a professional settings, you go with whatever is already in place
 inoryy: be grateful you're not locked into a hermetic tech island :P
 reCurse: Oh a wild inoryy
 reCurse: Rare sight
 tibithegreat: I meant for small scripts/tools I use once in a while
 MSmits: hey inoryy
 inoryy: hello!
 reCurse: Referencing your workplace? :p
 MSmits: you sleep at work inoryy
 MSmits:&#160;?
 inoryy: i can neither confirm nor deny
 inoryy: to both question :D
 tibithegreat: reCurse: you mean me with the workplace question?
 reCurse: No I meant inoryy sorry
 tibithegreat:&#160;:)
 inoryy: new avatar, reCurse
 MSmits: he had it for a while, but you've been gone for a while
 inoryy: yeah&#160;:/
 inoryy: what's new aside from avatar?
 MSmits: you guys should talk more, reCurse has made a lot of progress with ML on CG
 reCurse: Not much, doing ML at work, doing ML at CG, eh
 inoryy: nice! curious about the work part but I guess you can't share?
 tibithegreat: is it as cool as it looks?
 reCurse: Yeah I can't share
 inoryy: alright then at least give me the deets on CG side&#160;:) 
 reCurse: ...not yet anyway, maybe down the line
 reCurse: I got UTTT, BT, Othello and Checkers working on ML now
 MSmits: oware too
 inoryy: wow
 MSmits: and csb
 MSmits: and br2k
 reCurse: Well he said what's new
 MSmits: ah true
 inoryy: uttt conv or mlp?
 reCurse: Neither, but closer to conv I guess
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's been so long since I've been here that CG didn't autofill in chrome
 MSmits: hi BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: hi
 reCurse: Had rank 1 until MSmits spam submitted me out of it
 Westicles: As Frost said, my goal in life is to unite my avocation with my vocation
 MSmits: which game?
 inoryy: err neither conv nor mlp that leaves what? 1 layer recurrent?
 reCurse: uttt
 MSmits: do you mean today?
 reCurse: Well ok it's conv but not vanilla conv
 MSmits: if you mean earlier, karliso was already 1, not my faukt
 inoryy: ah ok
 inoryy: is it something novel? plan to publish?
 inoryy: I keep waiting for Agade &amp; pb to publish theirs
 MSmits: reCurse's problem is that he wants to be competitive also.
 MSmits: can't give away all your secrets
 MSmits: pb4 and agade did share some in their article
 reCurse: It sucks because
 reCurse: I'd probably end up learning a lot more going public
 reCurse: But I'd also lose my motivation
 reCurse: Catch 22
 inoryy: I mean publish as a scientific paper
 MSmits: thats my experience exactly. 
 MSmits: when i share stuff, i learn
 reCurse: I don't think anything I do is worth publishing tbh
 reCurse: I'm just a monkey banging very technologically advanced rocks
 inoryy: that makes two of us :P
 MSmits: the genius is domain specific to CG and the restrictions it has?
 inoryy: I mean if it's a modification of conv that you could show is transferable to at least one more commonly used task then it's def worth a publication
 reCurse: I doubt it's transferable
 reCurse: More of a hack to make it work with uttt
 MSmits: but what about the stuff you did with bt and such?
 MSmits: there's something general there
 MSmits: or is it just not new?
 MSmits: ideas from other sources applied to these games
 inoryy: Would be cool to hear more sometime&#160;:) I had a bunch of ideas to use CNNs on uttt but never got to doing them
 reCurse: Well seeing as you're probably retired off CG I could probably give you details in private
 inoryy: I'll take you up on that but some other time, gotta run
 reCurse: Sure, poke me on Discord when you do
 reCurse: Cya
 MSmits: bye inoryy
 MSmits: good to see you
 MSmits: have a good sleep listening to the hum of TPU's in the night
 reCurse: Glad my computer is not in my bedroom, GPUs sure are noisy
 MSmits: yeah, well even cpus are too loud if you sleep close to them
 reCurse: Not for me, I picked a pretty good silent cpu fan
 reCurse: But you don't have that ease of customization for gpus
 MSmits:  i need to do that for my next computer, should be within a year
 reCurse: Well it's also about picking a good case and all
 tibithegreat: I used to have stock cooler for my cpu and that thing was so loud
 tibithegreat: and my cpu was really hot (90 deg)
 therealbeef: stock is sh*t
 MSmits: 90 def is extreme
 MSmits: deg
 tibithegreat: then I went and overcorrected the problem with a big noctua cooler, never had a problem with it anymore&#160;:))
 MSmits: how often do you remove dust and such from inside the cage?
 reCurse: There you go, noctua
 MSmits: I do it probabyl twice a year
 therealbeef: 'good' case, or pretty case?
 therealbeef: :D
 tibithegreat: with the old cooler I would do it like once every 2 months or something
 tibithegreat: it was an ok case
 reCurse: Have a fractal design case, comes with those sliding plastic things where you can take the dust off
 reCurse: Like a dryer really
 therealbeef: built my hackintosh around the bitfenix portal
 MSmits: nice
 therealbeef: with red leds
 tibithegreat: well I built a new pc in the meantime, gave the old one to my gf
 reCurse: Hate leds
 tibithegreat: and this one has an AMD 5800
 tibithegreat: I went amd this time
 tibithegreat: and this thing runs so hot
 tibithegreat: like 45 deg idle temp
 tibithegreat: with a big noctua cooler
 tibithegreat: and AMD says it's ok to run it at ~90 deg
 reCurse: Rocket Lake seems to be headed that direction as well
 reCurse: A bit concerning
 tibithegreat: well if the manufacturer says it's ok
 tibithegreat: as long as it doesn't melt a hole in the motherboard
 tibithegreat: should be fine I guess
 Westicles: Can't believe Intel is still doing 14nm.  Things must be a mess internally
 reCurse: Well they got a new CEO right? Maybe it will help, who knows
 reCurse: Heard some bad stories about their work environment
 tibithegreat: ouch
 therealbeef: tsmc is doing 7nm right
 Westicles: They fired murthy, so that probably fixed a bunch of things
 Wontonimo: mega corporation bent on profit above all else ... reCurse you surprise me
 reCurse: And AMD isn't? :P
 tibithegreat: well AMD might be in the same situation tho
 tibithegreat: we just don't know about it&#160;:)
 reCurse: They dropped the ball hardcore on GPGPUs
 therealbeef: amd has a different design strategy i thought
 reCurse: Didn't see the emerging market coming at all
 tibithegreat: you mean Intel?
 reCurse: No AMD
 tibithegreat: oh
 tibithegreat: I thought their latest GPU's are pretty good
 reCurse: For gaming sure
 tibithegreat: well I feel like that's the main GPU market
 reCurse: But they're going to get eaten alive by nVidia if they don't come up with something on GP
 reCurse: Umm, see you're falling in the same trap they did
 reCurse: What's causing the shortage right now? Gaming?
 tibithegreat: oh
 tibithegreat: I see now
 tibithegreat: I thought GPGPU was a typo
 tibithegreat: but I was just uninformed
 struct: What does GP stands for?
 reCurse: General Processing
 tibithegreat: general purpose apparently
 reCurse: Oops
 reCurse: Whatever
 tibithegreat:&#160;:))
 reCurse: CUDA, machine learning, cryptomining(ugh), etc...
 struct: Thanks
 reCurse: AMD is getting eaten alive
 tibithegreat: is that such a big market?
 reCurse: It will cost them dearly
 tibithegreat: compared to gaming gpus?
 reCurse: AI is booming
 Wontonimo: like crazy
 tibithegreat: hmm interesting. I thought crypto was a bigger market for this than AI
 reCurse: Gaming may become a second class citizen in that area in a few years, but it's still not a done deal
 Wontonimo: our ai budget at work is about 30% of our dev spend
 reCurse: Crypto is very volatile, AI is not going away anytime soon
 Wontonimo: and the IT costs are about 50% of our spend
 Wontonimo: IT dedicated to AI
 tibithegreat: well yeah but that is mostly dev people and researchers
 Wontonimo: finance
 tibithegreat: common people shouldn't have need for AI GPUS
 Wontonimo: and tax
 reCurse: We're talking markets
 reCurse: AMD has missed a massive opportunity
 reCurse: nVidia is laughing all the way to the bank with their gamble on CUDA 10 years ago
 tibithegreat: well they need to get their pandemic manufacturing in order
 tibithegreat: I struggled a lot to get my 3080
 reCurse: It's mostly a shortage on gddr, nothing specific to nvidia
 reCurse: From my understanding anyway
 tibithegreat: it does seem to be a general issue, as sony is also having this issue
 reCurse: And a crazy boom from cryptomining thanks to covid
 LighTender: Do you know of any sites to learn Code Golf on python? (sites very advancing)?
 reCurse: Oh and AI is coming to gaming with DLSS
 reCurse: That's going to be a game changer, not sure how AMD will respond
 tibithegreat: well DLSS has already been here for quite a while
 reCurse: 2.0
 tibithegreat: and AMD does indeed need a response to it
 reCurse: Not requiring game-specific assets is huge
 tibithegreat: it was one of the reasons I got a nVidia
 tibithegreat: DLSS 2.0 won't require it to be trained specifically for the game?
 reCurse: That was the big deal with 2.0 if I'm not mistaken
 tibithegreat: I never heard of DLSS 2.0 actually
 struct: huge improvement
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-big-leap-in-ai-rendering/">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-big-leap-in-ai-rendering/</a>
 reCurse: "One network for all games"
 reCurse: Making it cheap for devs is a big key to democratization
 tibithegreat: yep
 tibithegreat: if this goes well and works as advertised
 tibithegreat: then yeah it's gonna be huge
 reCurse: I've been playing with DLSS lately, it's seriously impressive
 tibithegreat: but I can't imagine AMD isn't cooking up a response 
 reCurse: They slept on GP all this time
 tibithegreat: like DLSS has been here since 2000 series
 tibithegreat: well yeah but this ate away at the gaming market
 reCurse: But it was a niche feature
 reCurse: 2.0 is another story
 tibithegreat: they must have seen it
 tibithegreat: right?
 cooldude420: def yeah
 reCurse: Sure but you don't come up with a corporate answer in a year or two
 tibithegreat: like you can go ahead and brag about your teraflops
 tibithegreat: but then nvidia comes in and sets "DLSS on"
 tibithegreat: and blows you out of the water
 tibithegreat: they must realize they are playing a losing game
 reCurse: Yeah but they've been building up everything leading to this for over 10 years
 tibithegreat: well it's time to invest in that R&amp;D departament to come up with a breakthrough
 tibithegreat: it's definetly not easy
 tibithegreat: but it is what it is
 tibithegreat: like if they lose the gaming market
 tibithegreat: might as well just close the gpu shop
 tibithegreat: well actually
 tibithegreat: they still have consoles
 tibithegreat: but not sure how much profit they get from that
 reCurse: It won't kill them but they have a lot to catch up
 therealbeef: there's always a profit for low-end too
 reCurse: True, there's a lot of domains
 loberhauser: why is codingame so slow right now?
 kite1002: why not?
 struct: database update
 struct: Its always around this time
 inoryy: a bit late to the party but having some experience with AI, I think DLSS and more generally what Nvidia does in CV is really impressive and would take AMD many years and a lot of money to catch up.
 inoryy: the issue isn't even in reproducing DLSS 2 but preparing for the next step after that. Nvidia has strong research culture and reputation, which takes a long time to emerge organically
 reCurse: Very good point
 MaoKo: xor eax, eax or sub eax, eax to set zero?
 reCurse: I'd say xor
 MaoKo: right
 EmbeddedIs77: who the hell uses java and php for shortest mode

 u_know_not: certain people
 Sarcovora: seems like the PHP guy did beat a python and javascript  though
 Sarcovora: Also, prob people that haven't yet learned multiple languages
 Sarcovora: What are people's opinions on languages for shortest
 RockNTroll: where's my boy madknight
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 where am i&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i tried to fix it
 MadKnight: RockNTroll let's go to DM
 RockNTroll: I'm not ashamed to profess my love to you here
 MadKnight: lol i'm not saying not to do that i'm saying let's just continue in DM
 MadKnight: RockNTroll
 KidAlex97: im dumb and i dont know how to code at all
 KidAlex97: this dosnt make sense to my peanut brain sized head
 RockNTroll: that's ok, me neither
 RockNTroll: you're in the right place
 RockNTroll: but you made it this far so that's actually impressive
 KidAlex97: im dont get code this crud
 KidAlex97: head star hurt yeds
 RockNTroll: ok what's your smooth brain question
 RockNTroll: I will try to find a wrinkle in my brain to help you
 RockNTroll: Oh no he's gone

 LeBaoHoang8A4: how to move the ribbon in wood2 tron battle? i 'don't understand
 KYUMA:&#160;:)
 jacek: good morning
 TheTaskmaster: is it possible to compete with a specific person?
 TheTaskmaster: like, a 1v1 battle
 McCheng: Yes. You can start a private clash.
 TheTaskmaster: in fantastic bits
 TheTaskmaster: how?
 Putnam3145: for bot stuff there's just the players at the bottom
 Putnam3145: you can delete one and replace with anyone in your bracket
 TheTaskmaster: aight thanks
 LinhT.Nguyen: guys what does expected nothing means
 LinhT.Nguyen: even though outputing nothing is not mentioned in description
 SPDene: your output was too long: it was expecting ABC and you output ABCD
 LinhT.Nguyen: i see thank you
 TiziToure: hello who can explain me why I don't get my 
 TiziToure: 50xp on the battle of clash&#160;?
 sayori:  ds
 sayori: aSD
 sayori: X
 TheSilentCommitter_79c9: interesting
 logfk: How to use this website?:thinking:
 Q12: How to do nested loop in the Stub generator input?
 eulerscheZahl: loop a loop b read x:int
 Q12: thanks a lot
 Q12: I want to make loopline inside a loop how to do this?
 Q12: Never mind I did it :grinning:
 Putnam3145: how's score determined in bot stuff
 Putnam3145: the leaderboad at wood 1 here is kinda disturbing
 eulerscheZahl: Trueskill
 Putnam3145: boss is at 19.57, i'm at 17.38, everyone else is at 11.56 or below
 Putnam3145: only the top 5 are above 0
 eulerscheZahl: you gain score for wins and lose score for losses.but how much depends on your current and opponent score
 Putnam3145: oh no
 jacek: thats logical isnt it
 Putnam3145: only the top 13 of 83 here are failing to timeout
 Putnam3145: it's logical but, like, one sec, lemme verify something
 Putnam3145: oaky yes, it sure does appear that I can't even get close to the boss's score
 Putnam3145: ...despite literally winning every single simulated game
 Putnam3145: including against the boss
 eulerscheZahl: hard to believe
 Putnam3145: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/l6hyNf2.png">https://i.imgur.com/l6hyNf2.png</a>

 Putnam3145: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/hpZmMd5.png">https://i.imgur.com/hpZmMd5.png</a>
 Putnam3145: i can't even finish a simulation against the #2, it timeouts every time
 eulerscheZahl: you lost 1-3 vs the boss
 Putnam3145: that's kinda frustrating, since I straight up can't recreate that in IDE
 Putnam3145: wait no after 4 (!) wins in a row it managed to generate a losing one
 eulerscheZahl: if you are stronger than the boss and just got unlucky, resubmitting may help
 Putnam3145: only complaining cause I've tried that 3 times and I get consistently *far* worse results than I might expect lol
 Putnam3145: well, tried that and like
 Putnam3145: made adjustments, which might actually be a BAD idea
 eulerscheZahl: the fact the you are using D makes me curious: how did you find CodinGame?
 Putnam3145: previously non-coder friend told me about it
 Putnam3145: they had no idea that you could use D on it, but that was the deciding factor for me deciding to actually try it anyway
 jacek: D? deciding factor?
 Yimir: Language
 jacek: bloody hell
 hem123: is there like a game where you will train on pandas"
 Putnam3145: listen
 Putnam3145: i'm allowed to use D on personal projects, basic fast scripts I need to whip up and nothing else
 Putnam3145: and I find it actually pretty fun
 eulerscheZahl: nothing wrong with it. I was just curious because parts of the D community were very active on the forum and "enforced" that D was added to the CG platform
 Putnam3145: i can't imagine any other way it'd get here
 eulerscheZahl: so I was curious if you found your way from the dlang forum
 Putnam3145: it's strange just how quiet they seem to be for being so very loud
 Putnam3145: for the most part it's just shouting at each other that someone ought to advertise it
 eulerscheZahl: they left almost instantly after CG added D
 Putnam3145: i don't particularly know what to call the D attitude
 Putnam3145: i think the problem is that D doesn't really have a particular "thing" that its supporters love to pimp as much as e.g. Rust people do
 Putnam3145: personally I like the template system, and how much you can do at compile time in general
 Putnam3145: more than anything
 Putnam3145: Rust allows a lot of that but it's... "verbose" is the wrong word, it's mostly just difficult to read
 jacek: is D as performant as C++/Rust?
 Putnam3145: in practice, absolutely not
 Putnam3145: it's a garbage collected language
 Putnam3145: if you're extremely careful about it and use LDC then yes you can get really good performance
 Putnam3145: if you compile in -betterC mode it's practically guaranteed
 Putnam3145: oh, that and its multithreading is rather easy, but it's not significantly easier than, like, C++20
 jacek: woo new puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: Nice to see a 'real' D user who isn't just a zealot&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, what a pleasant change
 Astrobytes: Hey euler, my random insult throwing friend has returned:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/HGFYPY9">https://imgur.com/a/HGFYPY9</a> (bad language)
 eulerscheZahl: what have you done to make him angry?
 Astrobytes: Nothing, I don't recall ever speaking or even seeing the dude
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: He's Australian, so comes on when I'm offline and seems to have a strong desire to swear at me 
 JBM: stupid me, i solved the puzzle of the week last week
 SPDene: simple: just unsolove it, then solve it again :P
 JBM: currently looking for the unsolve button brb
 SPDene: I think you have to code that yourself&#160;:)
 Scarfield: ask struct
 Scarfield: but is he really cussing at you syteBortsA? maybe he was cheering GO, f yea
 Astrobytes: I doubt that dleifracS
 Astrobytes: Also, what's an AstroBetys?
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: "From now on you will refer to me as Betty"
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz1rjq5emKY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz1rjq5emKY</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah I got it :D
 freezy0001: a
 Dlx: wtf, who are people who actually sit here and paste code? when everyone uses 10-15 min, and they  have a pretty solution in 28 seconds ;p lololololol, what is the point???
 Astrobytes: Some people are fast, they might have seen the problem before. Also, you know there are bots in clashes sometimes right?
 SPDene: yeah - I've seen some who "type" 30 lines of code within 10 seconds
 Dlx: not possible to write so much code in 28 seconds&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Official CG bots yeah, so you have 'someone' to compete with when there aren't any human opponents
 Astrobytes: It tells you on their profile that they're a bot I believe
 Astrobytes: The captchas are there to prevent people writing their own bots but maybe there are some. Also pretty sure some people copy/paste from time to time.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm confident I could write a clashing bot.the captchas would just stop be from running it for a while without any input from myself
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the captcha system isn't particularly effective in that regard
 Astrobytes: Just a pain in the ass for most human players :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tt5bb7">https://prnt.sc/tt5bb7</a>that's one random upvote. how do you even find the contribution now?
 Astrobytes: wow :D
 SPDene: go to contribute / my contributions? or is that not what you're asking?
 eulerscheZahl: rhetorical question
 SPDene: what's that?
 SPDene: :P
 eulerscheZahl: possibility 1: user saved the link long ago, now returned to upvote
 Astrobytes: But... why?
 Dlx: what is the point of "following" someone in here??? 
 SPDene: oh - you mean how did THEY upvote?
 eulerscheZahl: possibility 2 (for lvl29+ users): open puzzle, view contribution
 eulerscheZahl: exactly: why? :D
 Yasser: congrats first place euler.
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. it's a back and forth for months already :D
 Yasser: do u work&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: took 2 weeks off&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but yes: I have a job
 Yasser: very Nice.
 Yasser: u live in Deutschland?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 SPDene: Dlx the only point I've found is that, once you're folllowing someone, you can spam them with invites to CoC (I have no idea why it would let random people do this, and it's really, REALLY annoying!)
 Yasser: do u enjoy holidays&#160;? I hope 
 Astrobytes: Dlx: you can see where they place in multis, puzzles they've solved when you're on the puzzle/multi landing page rather than looking up the leaderboard, invite them to clashes. That's about it for now.
 Yasser: nice time to take a break during the pandemic
 eulerscheZahl: i just wanted to code on a private project. just felt like it. I can take off without long planning luckily
 Astrobytes: SPDene, you know you can disable the notifications now?
 Dlx: @spdene maybe if you code in java or a laguage with few clashers, you could want to invite people you  are still not friend with&#160;:) I do java, and that sucks for small riddles like clash, because there is no reward for well structured code that "speaks" to the reader ;p
 SPDene: no I didn't
 Astrobytes: Settings-&gt;Notifications
 eulerscheZahl: go to your profile settings
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 Yasser: I like the roadmap they added recently 
 Astrobytes: You can choose to receive invites from people you chose to follow, or not at all
 Dlx: is that fall coding competition thing going to be fun?
 SPDene: thankyou!!!!! I have several people (i have no idea who they are) who regularly invite me 20+ times per hour
 Dlx: Only just started here, so have no idea what it is&#160;:)
 DomiKo: that will be contest
 Astrobytes: SPDene, yes this new-ish feature was a godsend&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know any details about the fall challenge yet. here's the game from the last contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 Astrobytes: Dlx: We don't know the contest but contest time is usually pretty fun
 Dlx: yeah, it was more general, are those type of contests in here usually fun&#160;:)
 Dlx: as @Astrobyte said ;p
 Astrobytes: Good atmosphere, chat is usually buzzing
 DomiKo: yes
 eulerscheZahl: imagine it being a multiplayer game. but 2k users playing it at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: you go to bed at rank 10 and wake up at 50 the next morning
 wlesavo: or you go to sleep and wake up in legend
 eulerscheZahl: that's my UTG story
 jrke: one approval needed for same game
 eulerscheZahl: and the cat writing about a planned change in the puzzle discussion. would be better to put it back to WIP i think
 Astrobytes: Agreed
 Dlx: the spring challenge, can you just enjoy it now like a regular bot game?
 Dlx: or whatever the "ai" games are called
 eulerscheZahl: yes. only difference: no prizes to win anymore
 Astrobytes: All (most) previous contests end up in multiplayer after
 Astrobytes: (or optim or puzzles, depending what they were ofc)
 eulerscheZahl: the only one I can think of that didn't: The accountant
 eulerscheZahl: not much of a loss I think. was similar to code vs zombies
 Astrobytes: Yeah it looked really similar
 eulerscheZahl: shooting mechanics were different. ash shoots whenever he can and always kills instantly
 eulerscheZahl: at TAC you had to target and the damage changed based on the distance
 Astrobytes: Ah I see
 Putnam3145: i am getting a timeout really consistently in the submitted matches but never locally. this is terrible
 Putnam3145: i'm gonna just start spamming plays until i find it
 Putnam3145: orr i can just send game parameters to IDE like a sane person
 Astrobytes: Don't forget to switch to manual so the seed is the same
 Putnam3145: yeah, totally
 Putnam3145: and now I know the exact issue
 Putnam3145: well, kinda
 Astrobytes: It's a start right?&#160;;)
 Putnam3145: i think there's an error it's just not showing me, and i'm definitely not getting an input where there should be
 Astrobytes: check against the default code 
 Putnam3145: wow i said "input" when that's the exact opposite of correct
 Putnam3145: one of my outputs isn't going out correctly, in a specific situation
 Astrobytes: Ah, lol
 Putnam3145: which does help, and I figure it's to do with some of the weirder metaprogramming i'm doing
 eulerscheZahl: and flush your error stream
 Adi137: hih
 frontendwizard: typescript is a no go for those clash
 frontendwizard: 😅
 jacek: huh
 AntiSquid: why is there a home button next to CG logo which already takes you to the home page? @_@
 Astrobytes: One of the great mysteries of our time.
 jacek: clicking on logo isnt obsvious
 LinhT.Nguyen: hehehehehehe
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 ban
 Automaton2000: but it's just my guess
 LinhT.Nguyen: hehehehehehehehh
 AggYzz: imagine using rust for coc
 Allis: I do think it'd be cool if there were a "performance" mode for Clash where execution time was the winning metric, but I realize it'd be too subjective.
 Uljahn: there is such mode, it's called "multiplayer ai bot programming" :smirk:
 Astrobytes: beat me to it
 Allis: Aye, fair enough, but that doesn't have the right-now excitement factor attached.
 Allis: I'm sure it can still be a high-pressure situation, just not in quite the same way.
 Astrobytes: You should try the next contest&#160;:)
 Allis: I'm terrible at programming. :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: So? It's fun, you don't need to be a god to enjoy it
 Astrobytes: It's a 10 day clash
 Astrobytes: Of bots
 AntiSquid: but you can make the argument there's no 15 minute time limit on multis
 AntiSquid: (i hate clash either way)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's why clashers clash I guess. Not my thing either.
 AntiSquid: was a response regarding the compilation time mode for clash
 Astrobytes: ah right

 tmwilliamlin168: hi
 DomiKo: using rust for coc?
 DomiKo: i use c++ for coc
 DomiKo: so?
 DomiKo: iam crazy?
 Putnam3145: what's coc
 jacek: k
 DomiKo: Clash Of Code
 Putnam3145: oh
 Putnam3145: who uses only one language for clash of code
 DomiKo: iam not using only one
 DomiKo: but most time I use c++
 DomiKo: and I mean
 DomiKo: language is language
 DomiKo: only in shortest
 DomiKo: it make difference
 Putnam3145: i use D by default but switch to C++ for anything that involves individual character manipulation, python for anything that I think might use list or set comprehensions, Ruby for anything involving string manipulation and often for golf,
 Putnam3145: yeah but some things are easier in some langauges
 Allis: Nah, the other two are about how quickly you write your program, not how fast it runs, so "scripting" languages are good.
 Putnam3145: ruby's string stuff is fantastically quick to write
 Putnam3145: same with python's list/set stuff
 DomiKo: 10 charactesr more
 DomiKo: isn't difference
 Putnam3145: what context is this in
 Allis: If you think the same program can be written in Ruby and C++ with only a ten character difference, you're not thinking straight. :P
 Putnam3145: `void main()` is 11 characters for one
 Putnam3145: int main is 10, sorry
 DomiKo: i mean
 Putnam3145: i'm staring at D code too hard
 Putnam3145: and that's 10
 Putnam3145: yes
 Allis: Empty string is 0...
 Putnam3145: but {} is 2, and&#160;; is each one
 DomiKo: iam thining about not whole program
 DomiKo: when we are talking about shortest
 Putnam3145: yeah, but shortest code sure does
 DomiKo: then yes
 DomiKo: its more than 10
 Allis: When speed is crucial, I can't think of any good reason to use any even remotely verbose language.
 Allis: Speed in the sense that's relevant to Clash, obviously.
 Allis: C++ is a great language, but only in certain contexts.
 Putnam3145: though i do have to say
 Putnam3145: i don't actually know ruby
 Putnam3145: i only know that it has easy regex syntax
 Allis: It has easy everything. :P
 Putnam3145: mostly for CoC i use D cause it's supreme at quick-and-dirty
 Putnam3145: especially since, for some baffling reason, they decide to start you out with `import std`, giving you access to the entire standard library
 Allis: That doesn't seem terribly unreasonable.
 Putnam3145: it does when there's two toUpper functions which clash
 Putnam3145: ...which is why I instantly switch to python or ruby upon seeing strings, mostly
 AggYzz: python with strings is so op
 AggYzz: it has a method for everything
 Allis: @DomiKo Sorry; Ruby has that too. :P
 AggYzz: one i used yesterday is str.title()
 DomiKo: Allis i cliked testcases
 DomiKo: idk why
 Allis: Haha! I did too. Bad habit.
 Putnam3145: oh and if i want ranges that AREN'T sets or lists D is boss
 Putnam3145: C++ is pretty good but the template syntax kinda makes me weep
 Allis: How's that? Ruby's ranges are *amazing*: (1..10) === 7 # =&gt; true
 Allis: @AggYzz Ruby has 192 methods on String out of the box, which is nuts. But Python does win when it comes to really nice slicing.
 Allis: str[::-2] is very, very nice.

 Putnam3145: str.retro.stride(2), rather
 Allis: Ooh, that is pretty good.
 Putnam3145: it gets kinda ridiculous with the chained UFCS at some point though
 Allis: Also kinda scary that ranges are mutable, apparently.
 Putnam3145: nah, that just gives you a view into the original string, which is actually just an immutable(dchar)
 Putnam3145: uh
 Putnam3145: immutable(dchar)[], rather
 Putnam3145: my brackets, they are not good today
 Allis: Hm? I just meant that D's Range has reverse(), which is in-place.
 Putnam3145: i've never actually used it
 Putnam3145: like, I'm not sure it's even often *usable*? it always seemed like a weird special case to me
 Galaxy_001: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52580dbb0a8f3ee2f6ab36eb1e90510eca7e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52580dbb0a8f3ee2f6ab36eb1e90510eca7e</a>Someone downvote my code. Is there something wrong?
 Putnam3145: What's the second input?
 Galaxy_001: iqweert23
 Putnam3145: It's referred to as "a number" twice, nothing more qualified than that
 benschreyer: the validator should not be the same as the test case, it should test the same thing  but with different input 
 Galaxy_001: ok
 Galaxy_001: thank you both
 eulerscheZahl: when was the house next to the CG logo added?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: In TrollvsCastles, let's say you throw 9 stones. Does the troll go the same distance if you throw 1 stone 9 times? (Assuming the opponent doesn't throw any)
 PAINANDSUFFERING: E
 PAINANDSUFFERING: huh my username didn't update
 eulerscheZahl: it did: pain and suffering
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Not on my screen...
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Maybe if i refresh...
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+F5
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Nope refreshing didn't do anything
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Oh
 PAINANDSUFFERING: nvm
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Annnnnd it's back to EEEEEEEEEEEEE
 PAINANDSUFFERING: For the codingame sponsored contest, if I "move", by how much does my score increase? 2?
 eulerscheZahl: that depends on your movement
 PAINANDSUFFERING: :O
 PAINANDSUFFERING: I'm assuming that it's different for each testcase?
 eulerscheZahl: no, there is a common rule. you just can't say it for a single move without seeing the big picture of it
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Okay...
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Do you know if any of the inputs give the points?
 PAINANDSUFFERING: That would be very helpful...
 eulerscheZahl: not given as input
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Oh, sad
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Hmmm it looks like I can get a score of 16 max on the first testcase...
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Just printing A and E...
 PAINANDSUFFERING: I get a score of 16 on the first two doing that, but on the rest a score of 2...
 AduVjpDev: hello dudes&#160;:&gt;
 PAINANDSUFFERING:&#160;:&lt;
 eulerscheZahl: so it's time to figure out what the other inputs stand for
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Nope I gave up already, I'm moving on to crystal rush to figure out why that's wacky
 PAINANDSUFFERING: :p
 eulerscheZahl: or you play the spring challenge
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Spring challenge?
 PAINANDSUFFERING: I missed that one
 eulerscheZahl: last contest
 PAINANDSUFFERING: Yeah I completely skipped it
 eulerscheZahl: so you are the reason why it didn't reach the 5k players
 PAINANDSUFFERING: :O
 PAINANDSUFFERING: I'm sorry...
 eulerscheZahl: about 4950 competed. biggest CG contest ever
 nsasupreme: dont talk to me
 PAINANDSUFFERING: So if I had joined the number would have increased by 50...
 PAINANDSUFFERING: I'm that popular?
 PAINANDSUFFERING: :O
 eulerscheZahl: you are not the problem alone, but you are part of it
 jacek: its like nonvoters
 xzxy: .

 Insufficient: hey guys, quick question: i know sharing competition bot scripts is frowned upon on githubs, so i dont do that
 Insufficient: but is it frowned upon to do githubs of your solutions to puzzles also?
 eulerscheZahl: not appreciated but it happens. you can find almost all puzzles solved there
 eulerscheZahl: official puzzles: probably all, maybe 1 or 2 missing
 Insufficient: i'm guessing kind of like the articles people do on CG i'd have to just explain high level what i did and use pseudocode - would that be ok?
 eulerscheZahl: community puzzles: at level 29+ you can see the code of the problem creator
 jacek: as long as there is more effort than copy&amp;paste solution, i think its alright
 eulerscheZahl: sharing the idea without giving a copy-paste ready solution is perfectly fine
 Insufficient: ok cool, thanks! yeah i won't share any code that stays in my private repo
 eulerscheZahl: i think there are only very few puzzles where you can't find a solution on github or on CG directly after leveling up: community puzzles with animations
 jacek: no solution for space maze?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: not the only animated community contribution

 AbundantPuddle: sosnik, good job, but be careful with your variable names. "sum" is a reserved keyword in Python.

 Allis: Which puzzle?
 RubyRen: Mars Lander - Episode 1
 RubyRen: :worried:
 Gorbit99: iirc, that's just about realizing what you *don't* want, and making the ship avoid that at all costs
 Gorbit99: it even helps you a bit
 Gorbit99: "As such, a thrust power of 4 in an almost vertical position is needed to compensate for the gravity on Mars"
 RubyRen: Thx, finally I solve it!!!!!!!  Spent me a night and a day....
 RubyRen: I thought it very difficult like a physical problem, but actually..

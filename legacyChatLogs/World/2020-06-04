 Imsure1200q: ok
 eulerscheZahl: did you really restart your computer in the hope for a more stable chat?that seems total overkill
 WINWINWIN: :D
 code_maniac: Nope i just checked my internet connection 🙈
 WINWINWIN: It does not mention on the FAQ,  but are tensorflow, keras, pydot and scikit available in python?
 BarangCK: :grimacing:
 Tiramon: if it isn't mentioned it isn't available WINWINWIN
 Tiramon: thats why they made the faq, else you could simply test it with an import, if the module isn't found ...
 Uljahn: are there any free python online IDEs with keras or scikit? i guess not

 AggYz: shortest code mode is unfair
 AggYz: whoever uses ruby will win
 rak1507: lol
 rak1507: learn ruby then
 AggYz: good idea
 AggYz: isnt ruby old tho
 AggYz: has no practical use other than dominating shortest code mode
 AggYz: and making python 3 kiddos cry
 WINWINWIN: true AggYz but you only need to learn the hacks for shortest, not any technical stuff
 WINWINWIN: also, perl, bash can be even more effective at times.
 rak1507: if you want to comfortably win most golfs, learn the basics of ruby, python, and bash (perl or sed)
 Imsure1200q: how abt javascript lol
 rak1507: js is a terrible golf lang
 Imsure1200q: i know its messy lol but i guess its very flexible
 DingYi: the "smallest island" test case always fail when submit, is the test broken&#160;?

 Imsure1200q: There are also spammers across youtube
 Astrobytes: OMG! 9 DIGITS!
 sHlOk: Lets find about them
 sHlOk: They are either koreans or chinese!!
 Imsure1200q: lol wouldnt it be weird if the first 2 digits tells their country and the next 7 is local phone number
 Imsure1200q: there seems to be no dashes so it would make sense if no parentheses as well
 sHlOk: china  has 86 and korea has 82
 sHlOk: So it cant be them!But the langusage is chinese
 Imsure1200q: how about japan
 Imsure1200q: there is like a weird integral symbol
 WINWINWIN: Imsure1200q hows space maze coming along?
 Imsure1200q: when you saw the question was it a math question?

 Astrobytes: It's Chinese spammers, posting a Chinese WeChat number, in Chinese. Get over it.
 WINWINWIN: Im guessing that Howard is a fake Harvard
 AntiSquid: sHlOk your user name reminds me of one of structs multi titles he plans to do
 sHlOk: @Astrobyte are they bloody hackers??
 Astrobytes: No.
 WINWINWIN: Man, they are obviously some kind of cheats if they go around selling fake diplomas
 sHlOk: Whats the reason behind spreading such damn web page?
 AntiSquid: why discuss fake diplomas here though?
 Astrobytes: How long have you people been on the internet?!

 AntiSquid: people making fun of great algorithms is strange
 Imsure1200q: cool
 sHlOk: Sorry if i had irritated u all but frankly speaking i m a grade 10 boy who is quiet axious regarding cyber security
 sHlOk: So came here to ask u all experts
 Imsure1200q: ye but just ignor it
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ Guy selling fake diplomas did not seem suspicious to you?
 AntiSquid: they can find out where you live if they are hackers and maybe break into your house at night when your parents sleep sHlOk
 Astrobytes: It's just spam dude, don't crack a rib or anything
 AntiSquid: also sHlOk don't talk to strangers
 sHlOk: @AntiSquod LOL i have a degree in XSS i!!!!

 Imsure1200q:  codingame?
 sHlOk: Yup @Imsure1200q
 sHlOk: Likw AlkhilJohn, Mathie,.......
 Imsure1200q: alkhiljohn is a bot?
 sHlOk: YAAA
 Imsure1200q: but i keep seeing him clash?
 sHlOk: Imsure1200q he clashes when no one joins a clash!! his level is stuck at 9 
 sHlOk: AND HE NEVER CHATS]
 Imsure1200q: but sometimes everyone joins a clash and hes there
 Imsure1200q: like sometimes hes not even the first person to be there
 sHlOk: I asked a real player of lev32 last day he said that he is
 Imsure1200q: is it possible to have a bot that can be used as a real account
 Imsure1200q: its a bot but at the same time its a real account that a person actually using
 sHlOk: U can say it looks like a real acc bu that can be a bot
 Imsure1200q: ya
 Imsure1200q: but i dont know how he wins some clashes
 sHlOk: Whats ur age bro?
 Imsure1200q: like
 Imsure1200q: you know those R-18 R-16 things
 Imsure1200q: its a bit above 10 but under 16
 sHlOk: Imsure1200q they already know the code bro as they are created by the web developers!!!
 Imsure1200q: so they're not a problem then
 sHlOk: But in order to look real sometimes they loose some clashes
 sHlOk: @Imsure1200q ya they are not problem 
 Imsure1200q: maybe they're to start clashes and motivate peepl to join?
 sHlOk: Hmm maybe 
 Imsure1200q: like i keep on seeing the Ganesan and AlkhilJohn
 sHlOk: who knows
 Imsure1200q: also BitWolf (is that the name?)
 sHlOk: Ya 
 sHlOk: YA bitwolf with a bluishpurple wolf profile?
 Imsure1200q: ya
 Imsure1200q: also i see euler somtimes
 Imsure1200q: lo
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Imsure1200q: oh well bots are bots and eulerscheZlha is not a bot
 Uljahn: bitwolf is an official CG bot i guess
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/</a>
 Heliferepo: Yes bitwolf is a bot
 Imsure1200q: slap
 Heliferepo: The best one is Tychkorg lol
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Tiramon: you can identify the cg bots pretty easy ... look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a> and everyone with &gt; 30k clashs is a cg bot
 WINWINWIN: Tiramon are the ranks for the CoC bots preset levels that CG decided?
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that's a lot of clashes
 Imsure1200q: wat
 Imsure1200q: what if i do 30k clashes rn am i a boot
 eulerscheZahl: :boot:
 Imsure1200q: sock
 WINWINWIN: boot
 Imsure1200q: btw euler is there an episode 2 for space maze
 eulerscheZahl: i never published it as i can't solve it myself
 Imsure1200q: ooo interesting
 Imsure1200q: lol
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6">https://www.codingame.com/demo/8261396e8df5c5414061da3c4310edb6b343d6</a>
 WINWINWIN: u finished the first one Imsure1200q?
 Imsure1200q: so demos are chalenges that arent published?
 eulerscheZahl: similar to part 1 but you have multiple cars to control. they can collide
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Imsure1200q: Win 3x not yet&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: euler that seems interesting
 eulerscheZahl: you can even upload your own games if you want
 Imsure1200q: yes but im already making some weird anatomy blender-like modeler game thingy
 Imsure1200q: also my heuristic is the worst but as long as i can solve
 remi6: If bots have no problem with Recaptcha, is it there just to annoy? :c
 remi6: When I pass Recaptcha multiple times in a row, it becomes almost unpassable.
 ViratKohli: yes
 WINWINWIN: Kohli??? meh... Pant for the win :P
 Imsure1200q: after you submit your work can anyone else see your code
 Quidome: yes
 Quidome: You can turn it off  in the settings
 Imsure1200q: in the IDE?
 Quidome: yes
 Imsure1200q: thanks
 Quidome: pull down menu top right, settings
 Quidome: under your username
 eulerscheZahl: bots are allowed for CoC. just not your own bots. only official CodinGame bots
 eulerscheZahl: obviously these don't get captchas
 remi6: I see. I wish I didn't get captchas too. Having them before each match is unbearable since they become more difficult each time.
 remi6: And in the end it is just this: "Your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now."
 struct: These clashes are fun
 struct: ...
 jacek: maybe captcha is part of the challenge
 jacek: after all its site about ai and making bots
 Imsure1200q: meme plz
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Imsure1200q: plz meme
 Imsure1200q: but theres no chatboot&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Working hard on Space Maze I see :smirk:
 Imsure1200q: 15% looking at comments on minecraft album videos
 Imsure1200q: 6% eating lol
 Astrobytes: "lol"
 Imsure1200q: ye
 Imsure1200q: and then the rest of the 79% can be divided into three areas
 Astrobytes: Why are you bothering to waste your time here.
 Imsure1200q: why not?
 Astrobytes: So many more minecraft video comments to read.
 Imsure1200q: yes but theres only so many
 Imsure1200q: some have bad words tho
 eulerscheZahl: next task: an automaton for minecraft videos
 Astrobytes: What, like "cosine" or "integral"
 Imsure1200q: lol its possible
 Astrobytes: Go and read something educational. Expand your mind a little.
 Imsure1200q: haha but you see, i'm always getting something educational
 Imsure1200q: every hour
 Astrobytes: As you've simply been uttering banal rubbish in here most of the day.
 Imsure1200q: i cant stop it thats just me rn when i see something interesting i go g 'ooOO'
 Imsure1200q: which is why 15% of the time, minecraft videos
 Astrobytes: If you have issues with your attention span you should do something about it.
 Imsure1200q: no i dont think i have
 Imsure1200q: the only issue is because technically i've had a 9-quarter school year but after that its easy
 Imsure1200q: and the 9-quarter wasnt for disciplining me lol it was because parents, relatives etc wouldn't listen to me
 Imsure1200q: this rubbish can fit into so many minutes in one hour&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't listen to you either if you spout the same kind of rubbish at home.
 Imsure1200q: we dont talk much at home
 Astrobytes: Well don't take it out on us. Comment on minecraft videos.
 Imsure1200q: lol ok
 Astrobytes: Become  a minecraft meme lord or something.
 Imsure1200q: that's actually a good career
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Imsure1200q: looking forward to it
 Imsure1200q: but first ill finish this space maze
 Astrobytes: At this rate you'll have 'finished' Space Maze sometime in your mid-70s.
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Imsure1200q: i dont even know if you will reach 70s
 Astrobytes: You. Not me.
 Imsure1200q: but yeah if i reached 70s lol i'd probs not do spacemaze anymore
 WINWINWIN: For all those interested, codeforces is having a stratified contest in 10 mins
 Imsure1200q: a 70-year-old minecraft memelord its so funny HAHA
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/
 Imsure1200q: what im serious it is funny
 Astrobytes: So funny that my sides are actually splitting here. Really.
 Imsure1200q: like your brain?
 Imsure1200q: dude that has some weird symptoms
 WINWINWIN: Not a great conversation Imsure1200q
 Astrobytes: Er...
 Imsure1200q: what?
 Imsure1200q: oh it looked like an insult lol
 WINWINWIN: Trying to avoid calling it blabbering now.
 Imsure1200q: no i literally mean your brain like a physical brain
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes taking part in codeforces?
 Astrobytes: It's been 'blabbering' for around 90% of his chat WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: Nah, not my thing WINWINWIN
 Astrobytes: *not my kinda thing
 Imsure1200q: lol
 WINWINWIN: My first one that will probably be fair, me participating in kotlin was ridiculous :P
 Astrobytes: lol, hey, you tried
 WINWINWIN: :D Tried using java, got completely confused with the "Random" bugs
 WINWINWIN: Guessing that eulerscheZahl will do codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 WINWINWIN: the contest, starting in 5 mins
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl">https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl</a>does this graph look like i would participate regularly?
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) The rating looked like it
 eulerscheZahl: so many contests,can't play all of themso i filter by prizes
 Astrobytes: Quality over quantity WINWINWIN
 inoryy: CF runs multiple times a week anyway
 eulerscheZahl: yeah. way too many to keep track
 WINWINWIN: Makes sense, CG takes priority then
 eulerscheZahl: i repeatedly though about unsubscribing to the newsletter. but sometimes there's a pleasant surprise
 Astrobytes: I don't really dig most CP stuff, I prefer the CG format.
 Vineetsadawari: hwello
 eulerscheZahl: on CG i always join a contest, no matter what prizes they offer
 WINWINWIN: Yes, I enjoy multis and AI programming a lot more than the puzzles
 WINWINWIN: Hey Vineetsadawari
 Vineetsadawari: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 Astrobytes: Anything where I don't have to recall half of CLRS just to pass a round suits me
 WINWINWIN: Yes, vineet, we have all registered
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't registered yet
 WINWINWIN: why not?
 eulerscheZahl: i almost always register on the day of the contest
 WINWINWIN: does it reflect bad on profile if you register and do not participate?
 Astrobytes: It's called being casually late WINWINWIN :P
 inoryy: you get banned from CG if you don't participate
 eulerscheZahl: so that's the real story of struct?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 inoryy: that's also why I also submit something in the first weekend, afraid of that ban
 Imsure1200q: oh really inorry
 AntiSquid: what does the q at the end of your nick stand for Imsure1200q&#160;?
 Imsure1200q: nothing
 Imsure1200q: its a typo
 JBM: fix it
 Imsure1200q: but i like it more idk why
 AntiSquid: change it to iq
 Imsure1200q: no its so weird
 AntiSquid: we need the meme material
 Imsure1200q: i like the q because the line is "assymetrical" to the I
 Astrobytes: Haven't you got a minecraft video to comment on?
 Imsure1200q: already commented
 Imsure1200q: one comment to help the utuber make his vids
 Imsure1200q: other to meme meme
 Astrobytes: More comments come while you waste time in chat.  They are waiting. Get them.
 Imsure1200q: nah last time i checked the video no extra new comments
 Astrobytes: Next video.
 Imsure1200q: besides who would want to watch the video cz the content is outdated
 Astrobytes: You. Clearly.
 Imsure1200q: but i didnt watch it lol
 AntiSquid: chat is temporary, comments are eternal
 Astrobytes: "lol"

 AntiSquid: too round about, he won't understand it
 Astrobytes: True.
 Imsure1200q: ye im not into that kind of language
 AntiSquid: watching paint dry is better than watching your video Imsure1200q
 Imsure1200q: but its not my video
 Imsure1200q: someone else's
 Astrobytes: "Your linked video" then.

 Xcalibre: 13-14=-1
 Snef: is this kid the "pro coder"  ?
 Imsure1200q: so im not yet born
 Astrobytes: 13 to 14
 Imsure1200q: snef you could put it like that
 Astrobytes: Naw that was another kid Snef
 Imsure1200q: im already used to being called a nerd and savvy and all
 Astrobytes: The copypaster
 Snef: oh ok
 Imsure1200q: but i havent copy-pasted code from others in a while now?
 Imsure1200q: i mean i could totally ask euler for the solution to space maze
 Astrobytes: Savvy? You're about as savvy as a drunk snail.
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Imsure1200q: cool words
 Imsure1200q: its fun to chat here :P
 WINWINWIN: Wait until ZarthaxX and jacek get here LD

 Astrobytes: I'm actually really holding myself back here.
 Imsure1200q: its good that u are
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Scarfield: feed the ducks, not the trolls.
 Xcalibre: Astrobytes i can only imagine how hard it must be for you
 Imsure1200q: but you dont feed persons duck food 
 Astrobytes: Then JBM's game wouldn't exist Scarfogenesis
 Astrobytes: Indeed Xcalibre&#160;:)
 Scarfield: that is art, i hope the artwork of the trolls stays as is AstroGemeni
 Astrobytes: I completely agree
 WINWINWIN: Scarfield COO at eevil corp&#160;:/
 WINWINWIN: Nice :P
 Imsure1200q: come on this argument didnt even last a day?
 Astrobytes: What argument?
 AntiSquid: make sure the confit duck is slow cooked&#160;?!
 Imsure1200q: you know where the older people call children names because they think children dont know a lot of things
 Imsure1200q: and like the children kinda get annoyed and talk back
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/
 Imsure1200q: wanna continu
 Astrobytes: You've been trolling us since... what, Sunday?
 WINWINWIN: I am not an *Older person* Barely 3 years older than you
 Imsure1200q: nah more like saturday
 AntiSquid: are you real philipino&#160;?
 Imsure1200q: if i werent i wouldnt put Philippines would i
 WINWINWIN: People do all kinds of stuff here...
 AntiSquid: because filipinos listen to their elderly ... kind of a tradition in that country
 Astrobytes: I think he did speak some Tagalog the other day
 Imsure1200q: but their elderly
 AntiSquid: yet you say the opposite
 WINWINWIN: "Elderly" AntiSquid??? Adult sure but I dont think anyone here is "Elderly" :P
 Imsure1200q: haha how many filipinos do you think listen to their elderly yet still think the same
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 is
 Imsure1200q: by fil i mean children
 Automaton2000: starting from the last time i had to write a proper bot
 Imsure1200q: the only think that comes to mind there is when filipinos say "po opo ho" to others and give lola and lolo a bless
 WINWINWIN: The number of times Automaton2000 manages to say something coherent with the conversation always surprises me
 AntiSquid: well lots of filipinos in UK told me same thing, listen to people older than you :p
 Automaton2000: i don't plan to do that to me
 WINWINWIN: magus did a really good job making him
 inoryy: Automaton2000 say something relevant
 Automaton2000: might have to try that
 Astrobytes: :D
 Imsure1200q: ea
 WINWINWIN: :D
 inoryy: the elder has spoken
 Imsure1200q: with a gandalf-like impression or smth
 Astrobytes: Yes, inoryy is Gandalf.
 Imsure1200q: he was an actor?
 Astrobytes: Can't you tell by his avatar?
 Imsure1200q: no its too smal
 WINWINWIN: inoryy what is the latest game that DeepMind has been focussing on? Googling it gives different results each time.
 Astrobytes: Space Maze obvs
 Xcalibre: Astrobytes lol
 WINWINWIN: :D sometimes it says StarCraft and sometimes Go
 inoryy: WINWINWIN starcraft 2
 Xcalibre: the alphastar ai?
 inoryy: yeah
 AntiSquid: i wanted to play sc2 ai bot thingy, but the setup description seemed really confusing so dropped it before i even started :p
 Xcalibre: inoryy is a project ever 'completed'?
 inoryy: what do you mean?
 AntiSquid: maybe he's saying are you always improving older projects?
 Xcalibre: is the algorithm for the artificial intelligence constantly improved?
 Xcalibre: sorry for being vague
 Astrobytes: Nah. Once it can do a probe rush they jsut move on.
 inoryy: there are certain milestones after which most of the team moves on to new things, with alphastar that was the nature paper; can't comment on whether there will be any future work on top of sc2 but it's not locked in a vault or anything
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes that's the openAI mentality, only train 17 heroes and claimed they need to move on, the AI can rush lanes in a very restricted meta, job's a gooden
 Xcalibre: oh :smiley:
 AntiSquid: train on 17 heroes *
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid
 inoryy: Xcalibre there's no single AI agent that everyone uses and improves if that's what you're asking
 WINWINWIN: Has DeepMind done research into Bridge?
 WINWINWIN: As in the GIB software?
 Astrobytes: They just hardcode everything and pray Xcalibre :P
 Xcalibre: Astrobytes, XD
 Astrobytes: Sorry, can't get out of troll mode again
 Xcalibre: should have used troll mode earlier
 WINWINWIN: Nah, poor kid
 Astrobytes: I was. That's why I'm stuck in it.
 Imsure1200q: full power
 Imsure1200q: 3 minutes high on oven
 WINWINWIN: We were probably too mean to him
 WINWINWIN: nvm
 Astrobytes: Too mean? Not mean enough, you mean.
 WINWINWIN: :D yes dr Seuss
 Imsure1200q: 10 minutes 300 F on oven
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 AntiSquid: why use fahrenheit&#160;?! 
 WINWINWIN: Kelvin is the SI
 Imsure1200q: because its the most stressful temperature unit ever
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ backk to troll mode pls Astrobytes :P
 Imsure1200q: if you want in Kelvin its 422 but either way the oven is wowow
 Astrobytes: Bored now WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Xcalibre: :disappointed:
 AntiSquid: i don't think your "troll mode" works the way you think it does
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: it rather adds more fuel to the fire, it's rather encouraging him to say more weird stuff
 Astrobytes: Yes, feeding the troll with trolling. It's good for wasting time.
 Astrobytes: Parameter fitting etc
 AntiSquid: next there will be a formula proving that the speed of ray tracing is the limit
 AntiSquid: universal limit
 inoryy: and that speed? 3vel
 Imsure1200q: but you need lots of time to raycast
 Astrobytes: You've had all week.
 WINWINWIN: I didnt hear of ray tracing until Imsure1200q told me... 
 AntiSquid: what about pixel shading Imsure1200q&#160;?
 Imsure1200q: takes a lot longer
 Imsure1200q: not really a lot but if you involve many lighting calcs then ya
 Xcalibre: am i missing something or is raycasting actually relevant to space maze?
 AntiSquid: ofc it is
 Imsure1200q: using raycasing to see if a platform will move to void or it cant move
 WINWINWIN: google raytracing Xcalibre
 Astrobytes: Only in combination w/ a NN and A*. And hardcoding replays.
 Imsure1200q: i removed the hardcode
 Xcalibre: Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world.
 Imsure1200q: now its soft smooth mm delicate
 Astrobytes: Converted to softcode now huh
 WINWINWIN: Tracing the path is the point Xcalibre
 Imsure1200q: its the opposite of hardcode + CNN
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN He said ray-casting as opposed to tracing
 Imsure1200q: raycasting is kinda like the first step in raytracing
 WINWINWIN: Understood
 Imsure1200q: its raytracing except you dont bounce ur rays
 WINWINWIN: But wth does a NN have to do with anything?
 Astrobytes: Ra-casting involve just the one ray
 AntiSquid: but you need to extract and extrapolate the concept, then you can reapply the same principle elsewhere
 Astrobytes: *Ray-casting
 Imsure1200q: i thought it would be good to use NN but now im lazy to do NN
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ r u serious
 AntiSquid: you can then ray cast a CNN beam
 Astrobytes: He knows binary search, relax
 Imsure1200q: i dont know how to apply "tiles" to NN so no
 Xcalibre:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: hope nobody comes in reading the chat thinking we are serious
 Imsure1200q: btw astro if ur trying to get me to falsify the "i learn something every hour" its not working&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Have you ever tried applying thought to thinking?
 Imsure1200q: ye
 WINWINWIN: Perfect time for someone like cegprakash to log  in and take the conversation seriously :P
 Imsure1200q: ha invite us to competitions
 AntiSquid: i am applying moisture to water
 Astrobytes: Tales of Prunes and Rays
 Astrobytes: A CG Chat Anthology
 Imsure1200q: and trols
 AntiSquid: trolling chat why the world outside is going mad
 AntiSquid: why are there protests in Australia&#160;? 
 Imsure1200q: racists
 AntiSquid: i mean shit went wrong in america, suddenly the world protests
 Imsure1200q: every country trying to grab attention
 Imsure1200q: no every person
 AntiSquid: didn't see any protests about women being stoned alive in the middle east .
 Imsure1200q: maybe they werent allowed to protest?
 AntiSquid: ya this chat is more logical imo
 WINWINWIN: Thats not how it works Imsure1200q I dont think that any country allowss violent protests
 Imsure1200q: but peaceful protest
 AntiSquid: you need a book a reservation for the particular street you want to vandalize and rob
 Xcalibre: that's why they're protests WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: Yeah
 Imsure1200q: protests are kinda weird lol
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/
 Xcalibre: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: sorry for bringing that up, let's go back to more fun stuff, Automaton2000 what can win the nobel prize in CS&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you can see my code
 WINWINWIN: Very confident :P
 eulerscheZahl: I have a nobel prize
 Xcalibre: show it Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but you don't want to mess with you

 Imsure1200q: auto is bot or no?
 Imsure1200q: Automaton2000 is not a robot?
 Automaton2000: yeah, i followed that topic eulerschezahl in the forum
 AntiSquid: shhh, he might use his code on you Imsure1200q
 eulerscheZahl: stop it automaton
 WINWINWIN: Nice, found your name euler :D
 Imsure1200q: what is his code
 WINWINWIN: Do it again Automaton2000
 eulerscheZahl: the NN one is even worse about pings
 Automaton2000: you might be able to read it
 Imsure1200q: so if i type a Automato 2000 he will reply?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Imsure1200q: and he will mess with your ping or smth?
 AntiSquid: yes
 WINWINWIN: Markov chain gives probability to latest word right?
 Xcalibre: he learns from the chat
 Imsure1200q: Automato 2000
 AntiSquid: he will initialize the ping of doom
 WINWINWIN: R u serious kid&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: automatoes
 WINWINWIN: "Automato 2000"
 Imsure1200q: Au tomato 2000
 eulerscheZahl: au[tab key]
 eulerscheZahl: try it
 WINWINWIN: Automaton2000 say eulerscheZahl
 Imsure1200q: dont fill in the blanks Automat_n 2000
 AntiSquid: you need es after tomato @Imsure1200q
 Automaton2000: i don't think it's a bit different
 Imsure1200q: Automatoes2000
 WINWINWIN: *Facepalm*
 Imsure1200q: Automatoen2000
 AntiSquid: try again with s, quite sure it's working
 eulerscheZahl: go watch some minecraft
 Imsure1200q: What if i only type automato n
 Imsure1200q: Automatoes
 Imsure1200q: Automatoes2000
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 Imsure1200q: ur not auto
 Uljahn: tontonautomaton2000
 Automaton2000: what's going on with my life
 AntiSquid: weird, expect an angry CG user to popup by now and tell you to stop pinging
 <b>**WINWINWIN wonders why Automatoes does not work</b></p><p><img src="/a/45527340374232" /> Imsure1200q: i dont have problems with ping tho
 WINWINWIN: AutomatonNN as good?
 AutomatonNN: you can find the code in the replay
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN you pinged tomatoes
 WINWINWIN: Yes&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: Automato tom ate the tomato AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: congrats struct
 Imsure1200q: no ping
 Imsure1200q: no destruction
 struct: Thanks AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: 1 hour i deserved it
 Imsure1200q: 2000tomatoes,Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: its so easy to get started with
 Imsure1200q: i dont get it
 Imsure1200q: why isnt my ping getting disturbed or smth
 WINWINWIN: struct how much more work does the latest multi need?
 struct: Yinsh?
 struct: or the other one im making?
 WINWINWIN: the one that you`re making
 AntiSquid: shogin 
 Astrobytes: Shabu
 struct: I had to pause it for a bit due to personal matters
 Astrobytes: Shoba
 Astrobytes: Shaolin
 struct: shobu
 Astrobytes: That's it :P
 Astrobytes: Life comes first.
 Imsure1200q: tomatoes
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) all of these games have such wierd names "Oware Abapa", "Yinsh" etc/
 Imsure1200q: press 5 random keys on your keyboard and thats the name of your challenge forever
 eulerscheZahl: tzaar, dvonn
 Imsure1200q: very nice names
 WINWINWIN: Are onitama and vindinium real games or did you make them up euler?
 eulerscheZahl: real names
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium is a port, was on its own website: vindinium.org
 eulerscheZahl: but down for years now
 eulerscheZahl: you wrote the bot offline and then connected to a server
 eulerscheZahl: computing your moves and sending them
 eulerscheZahl: so you could only fight those who were online at the same time
 WINWINWIN: Then this is a pretty big improvement
 WINWINWIN: what was your rank there?
 Astrobytes: Oh I thought they did automated matches at some point on vindi
 Illedan: That concept sounds very fun, equal to simple gaming. Just having to setup a lot before getting started
 eulerscheZahl: never played it
 inoryy: there wasn't a stable leaderboard per se anyway

 AntiSquid: unauthorized Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: OupsAn error occurred (#UNAUTHORIZED): "You must be the owner to share this replay".

 eulerscheZahl: boooring
 Illedan: Just my superwised NN failing misserably :sob:
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Xcalibre: that's me trying to find my way through life
 Astrobytes: It thought about doing the race, then bailed out
 AntiSquid: supervised in what way?
 Astrobytes: He watches it learn
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: no i mean what model
 WINWINWIN: Where did you get the datapoints to train it?
 Illedan: From my own SA
 eulerscheZahl: he played with his keyboard
 WINWINWIN: Did you have to use Agade`s tool to fit the code into the limit?
 Illedan: nah
 Illedan: not for this problem
 Illedan: this is 100&#160;% C#
 Illedan: both the learning and playing
 Illedan: So many possible sources of failure
 Illedan: -.-
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)

 Imsure1200q: is async functions allowed in IDE
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Imsure1200q: its not doing the async functions tho
 Imsure1200q: and its taking so long to render 100ms worth of code
 Imsure1200q: euler theres bugss
 Imsure1200q: it was only my 13th turn and it said timeout
 AntiSquid: "render" 
 Imsure1200q: *do
 AntiSquid: how many polygons&#160;? :p
 Imsure1200q: like
 Imsure1200q: about 2
 AntiSquid: are you doing any JS games?
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean bugs in your code or the game?
 Imsure1200q: game
 eulerscheZahl: then i refuse to believe it
 Imsure1200q: why isnt codingame making it async
 Astrobytes: Yeah, euler always writes games totally full of bugs
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Pretty much every game and puzzle is bugged.
 eulerscheZahl: and then i act as they aren't there
 Astrobytes: So is the leaderboard.
 Imsure1200q: but why does it end at 13 not 200?
 struct: because you timeout?
 WINWINWIN: timeout?
 Astrobytes: euler laid a bug trap for you
 eulerscheZahl: like running out of levels at Number Shifting :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 Imsure1200q: but loss conditions says that its 200 turns that it stops not 13
 Astrobytes: ...

 eulerscheZahl: what time limit do you use?
 Imsure1200q: none of those loss conditions met in my code
 struct: Response time ≤ 1000 ms for the first turn, 50 ms for every turn after
 Imsure1200q: but its below 50 tho?

 AntiSquid: why settimeout&#160;? :D
 Imsure1200q: how about setinterval?
 WINWINWIN: LD
 WINWINWIN: *:D
 AntiSquid: 50 ms / turn
 eulerscheZahl: i hate it that I now lose all the chat history the moment I enter the IDE :rage:
 Imsure1200q: yeah and?
 AntiSquid: you set timeout like that ofc your timeout rofl
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Imsure1200q: but your not looking at the inside of the function?
 Imsure1200q: *parameters
 AntiSquid: no because you have there over 50ms worth of timeout
 Imsure1200q: but look inside it
 Imsure1200q: and thats the first turn anyway so why must it be below 50ms
 AntiSquid: you don't need to set timetout
 AntiSquid: you don't even need to measure time for simple code
 Imsure1200q: the code supposed to do this: after 100ms set an interval that brings the car left and right each 50ms
 AntiSquid: just output something 
 AntiSquid: are you doing your own game?
 Imsure1200q: no
 Imsure1200q: doing spacemaze
 Imsure1200q: im doing interval because i wanna see how my heuristic works
 Imsure1200q: if i dont pass a move by 1000ms on the first turn it will timeout
 Imsure1200q: so im passing a move on the 100th ms to prevent timeout
 Astrobytes: What on earth are you on about?
 Imsure1200q: like
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/
 Imsure1200q: setting intervals but somehow codingame isnt running it async
 AntiSquid: look at default code, run the default code first and see how it works
 AntiSquid: i think that will help you
 Snef: this is priceless
 Imsure1200q: wdym default code
 AntiSquid: yes
 Imsure1200q: thats literally like whats at every start of a challenge
 Cesarus82: helklo
 Cesarus82: HOw ARE U
 Cesarus82: DOING
 AntiSquid: yes
 Imsure1200q: i've tried that enough times
 Cesarus82: I love codin
 Cesarus82: YEYEYE
 Cesarus82: MY MAn
 AntiSquid: looking good
 Cesarus82: yeye
 Imsure1200q: i think what codingame is doing is that it only works on the interval once it THINKS it is 100 ms when its actually 1200ms
 AntiSquid: need some human music
 Imsure1200q: woof
 Cesarus82: yeye
 Imsure1200q: automaton2OOO

 Derthek: Hey, I am starting Code vs Zombies to learn MCTS, but I am not sure how should I explore the legal moves since there are many possibilities (not like a grid which would be up, down, left or right). Any suggestions or references where they address this issue?
 Imsure1200q: haha not getting rick rolled
 Imsure1200q: probs
 Imsure1200q: WINWINWIN in that pastebin you forgot a )
 WINWINWIN: Ok
 Csipcsirip: you can define meta-actions Derthek. like move to position of zombie[n]
 Csipcsirip: but I dont think CvZ is the best game to practice mcts
 AntiSquid: it's not rick roll, it's human music Imsure1200q, promise
 Derthek: Hmm, that sounds reasonable Csipcsirip! Thanks. Do you know any other game to practice mcts?

 Derthek: Thanks for the answers! I'll have a look :D
 AntiSquid: that's a jerry, not a rick :p

 Astrobytes: Very accurate
 pb4: Hi
 struct: Hello pb
 pb4: Astrobytes, I saw UnnamedCodingamer went very high on the TvC leaderboard and he was on the chat yesterday
 pb4: did he say anything about his approach&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, MC
 pb4: Interesting, and surprising
 Astrobytes: Yes, I thought the same
 pb4: Hi struct
 Astrobytes: He did point out he was 9th before the update, so there's still a few broken bots in the leaderboard, but still
 pb4: I seem to be 50/50 against him
 pb4: or to be exact, 25/25/50

 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see any strategic depth in it
 Astrobytes: What's your approach pb4? If you don't mind me asking
 pb4: I'd prefer not to say too much
 pb4: but
 pb4: not NN
 pb4: not MC
 eulerscheZahl: something with nash equilibrium? or markov chain?
 Astrobytes: That's fair enough&#160;:)
 pb4: Yes eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: that would be what i would do. but can't be bothered
 Astrobytes: Makes sense I guess.
 Scarfield: Prune traceAray
 Astrobytes: Is that what you use then Bitfield? :P
 Astrobytes: (well played on that one btw)
 Scarfield: :D
 Scarfield: i have 4 ifs :p
 Astrobytes: True AI
 Scarfield: lol the game just called me stupid, and the game summary xD
 AntiSquid: i just remembered i once had to remove the stones from a bunch of prunes because the manager at that kitchen thought it's worthwhile to pay less for prunes but waste time to remove the stones ... 
 Scarfield: salary well spent
 Astrobytes: Yeah AntiSquid, I once had a guy who insisted on whole fresh baby squid for breaded calamari, in a pub. The prep was... not fun.
 AntiSquid: i done breaded squids in pub too 
 AntiSquid: cajun seasoning
 Astrobytes: It's a staple bar snack in most pubs these days.
 Scarfield: "GAimax is true AI" JB-M has had some fun here

 AntiSquid: submitted a new improved D bot, let's see where it lands
 inoryy: who's unnamedcodingamer, agade?
 AntiSquid: 100% win vs pb4

 inoryy: makes sense
 AntiSquid: 13/50 final rank, D is the way
 LelouchVC2: my monittttooooorrrrrrrrrr isss cooommmminnnnnnggggggg!
 UnnamedCodinGamer: antisquid spreading fake news for a second time 
 AntiSquid: why you hate D&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: "I found a bug on the leaderboard" :joy:
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am not agade&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: leaderboard is probably wrong, yes
 AntiSquid: i should be first
 jacek: why TvC replays are black for me?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: many of the bots were not working when I submitted 
 jacek: needed to refresh
 Astrobytes: jacek, get the JS console output please, need to pass to JBM
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, I think it is a known problem
 jacek: is working now
 Astrobytes: We reported this issue last night but need the console output
 JBM: known but not too reproducible&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Hasn't happened to me today so far&#160;:/
 JBM: hasn't happened to me ever
 jacek: happened again
 JBM: gimme the data
 jacek: when i loaded replay with 1 frame
 Astrobytes: Get the JS console log
 jacek: how can i do it?
 jacek: chromium
 JBM: or just the game report
 jacek: where is game report oO
 JBM: just tell me what happened in the game
 AntiSquid: JUST DO IT!
 JBM: with words
 JBM: something to work with
 JBM: did either AI do something very stupid I hadn't thought of
 jacek: well the other guy timeouted in 1st turn
 jacek: then everything is black
 jacek: and other repays are black now too
 JBM: ok, that can happen
 JBM: (t/o on 1st turn)
 jacek: eeyup
 JBM: lemme try and see if that reproduces anything
 JBM: me TO on the left; still seeing frames
 AntiSquid: #11
 jacek: what about TO on the right
 JBM: me TO on the right, same
 jacek: and replay on the leaderboard, not IDE
 JBM: ok got one
 JBM: crashes the viewer
 jacek: actually not always reproducible. i think you need to click lat battles and see the TO as first battle
 jacek: so much trolling it crashes viewer
 JBM: well with an AI that does 100% TO it comes along much faster ^^
 JBM: what did I do to my rank just to debug your things
 jacek: this games sounds like the bet tic-tac-toe
 JBM: i'll try and reproduce out of the platform, their minified JS is really making it horrible
 JBM: it was second battle in my case
 JBM: drat, called for drinks
 JBM: remind me i was on this when i come back
 LelouchVC2: The leaderboard is fff'ed uppsie
 LelouchVC2: l
 Alshock: fff'ed?
 struct: euler is your puzzle tool working?
 GalvaBart: hi all, is the clash of code chat still available? couldn't find it
 LelouchVC2: Screwed up
 LelouchVC2: Clash of Code chats are specific to each clash
 GalvaBart: oh now i can see it , thanks
 GalvaBart: huh, it's gone again, i mean the CoC tab, weird
 GalvaBart: the chat for CoC
 jacek: lately they close. dunno if its bug or feature
 jacek: after the clash starts
 GalvaBart: thanks jacek for confirming!

 jacek: o.O
 LelouchVC2: Yea, start over
 LelouchVC2: It looks way too weird. The encrypted string is smaller than the original, the ins and outs are just random letters so it's hard to debug, and the solution looks like a randomly put together encryption
 Astrobytes: Guys, comment on the contribution page- more helpful and a bit more permanent
 LelouchVC2: My comments are timeless
 Astrobytes: :P
 Alshock: @Astrobytes and given the content of that comment, if it's followed by action it might last longer on the chat than on the contrib
 LelouchVC2: lmao!
 Astrobytes: Alshock Didn't check the contrib (don't clash), but silly/invalid suggestions/comments usually get voted down and/or rebuffed
 LelouchVC2: My comment could have been silly or invalid?&#160;:(((
 LelouchVC2: Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine
 Alshock: I'm just playing the devil's attorney there :P I get your point
 Astrobytes: lol
 LelouchVC2: Let's all meet up one day
 Astrobytes: Well, we're here no?
 LelouchVC2: You expect me to mass murder over chat?
 Astrobytes: You can do whatever you like behind a keyboard.
 Alshock: my keyboard doens't come with spikes to gouge my ennemies' eyes
 LelouchVC2: ^
 LelouchVC2: The amount of people I owe fist fights too is amazing
 Astrobytes: Pfff. Get a new keyboard.
 Alshock: One that says "FATALITY" when your hit is over 9000
 LelouchVC2: I was looking to get the XMAL's new 812 Killer Steel Series keyboard
 WINWINWIN: On the discord server, thse messages are auto generated right?
 WINWINWIN: Welcome, Tweeety. We hope you brought pizza.
 LelouchVC2: Yes
 LelouchVC2: No one is sitting there typing to everyone who comes in 😂
 WINWINWIN: Then this is perfect :P "A wild cegprakash
 LelouchVC2: Unless of course they bought astro's keyboard
 LelouchVC2: I don't get the reference&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: yeah I was looking for an appropriate emoji WINWINWIN but couldn't find one :D
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Alshock: :japanese_ogre:
 Alshock: this is the best emoji
 Alshock: we should use it more often
 WINWINWIN: Japanese Ogre?
 WINWINWIN: Yes, will use it to scare phillipines kid away&#160;:)
 Alshock: yeah and all the outer hair melts with the chat's background
 LelouchVC2: savage
 eulerscheZahl: struct 08:00PMeuler is your puzzle tool working?
 struct: Its working now
 struct: But 2 days or something it wasnt
 struct: The Search puzzles and stuff site
 eulerscheZahl: it runs on heroku. it's paused when unused, takes some seconds to start
 eulerscheZahl: free hosting..
 struct: The site was working but when i pressed search it was return 500
 eulerscheZahl: maybe a bad input
 eulerscheZahl: i managed to crash it too with a bad input, was too lazy to investigate
 eulerscheZahl: like searching for a floating point number :D
 struct: oh might be that I guess
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and 1 or 2 puzzles have an incomplete HTML statement in my database (CG gave me garbage). so that screws up the formatting for later hits
 struct: It was just some clashes that drove me crazy
 Astrobytes: can't you put an index page on your heroku euler, with your available things on it
 Astrobytes: Or link them on dbd r's wiki thing
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/search/symmetric">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/search/symmetric</a>the broken formatting
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i'll add a navigation
 eulerscheZahl: and i should update the database. also for codejam results

 Astrobytes: Cool, thanks
 struct: Let me see If I can still find the puzzle
 struct: I managed to find the solution
 eulerscheZahl: i even have an API to update the puzzle list on the website directly without committing again
 struct: but they are just guessing puzzles now
 eulerscheZahl: who are "they"?
 Astrobytes: "they"?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: Jeez!
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct:&#160;:'(
 struct: rip my english
 struct: it's getting worse by day
 Astrobytes: It's a hell of a lot better than my Portuguese struct&#160;;)
 struct: I might have a bit of time to finish Shobu 
 struct: lets see if I can do it
 Astrobytes: No rush, you still have 'til the end of the week to meet your target right?
 struct: Yeah
 struct: I tried to separate referee from viewer
 struct: For some reason it did not go well and I have 1  bug
 struct: I think the game looks fun though
 struct: Have no idea how easy it is for AIs
 WINWINWIN: For my benifit, who are "they"?
 struct: They = Clash of codes puzzles
 Astrobytes: Yeah it looks like something I'd play irl, we'll see how we fare with our bots :D
 struct: thibat challange starts tomorrow right?
 Astrobytes: yeap
 AntiSquid: did you set your alarm clocks guys? it's starting early in the morning!
 AntiSquid: 6 AM UK! no sleep till legend
 struct: if its a community multi you wont sleep&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i will use ceg formula to calculate my legend equivalent rank
 struct: Top 3 in yinsh are doing little  competition between themselfs I guess
 JBM: i have no idea why that viewer goes black
 JBM: i can pick a match in the last battles
 JBM: repeatedly close it and open it again
 JBM: eventually it goes black
 JBM: at which point they're all broken
 JBM: but closing last battles and opening it again gets it back
 JBM: the exception is thrown by pixi
 JBM: and i'm not even using it directly yet
 struct: Which game JBM?
 struct: TvC'
 struct:&#160;?
 JBM: yeah
 JBM: i'll fix my demo to remove the "my fault" part of some exceptions
 JBM: and leave only the "cg fault" part of it
 struct: Even when I open IDE I get errors
 JBM: but if that doesn't change it, I'm dropping the towel
 struct: "VM1601:3 Error: The frameId "troll.png" does not exist in the texture cache"
 JBM: that one's the "my fault" part
 JBM: the one i'm fixing now
 struct: ah ok
 JBM: the one for logo.png is the CG's fault part
 JBM: and then... who knows
 struct: Oh god
 struct: When I open Yinsh page I get so many errors lol
 JBM: yeah who wrote them :p
 Astrobytes: I think the black viewer was happening before... was a cdn thing iirc
 struct: Not my fault :D
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0a94b7f6-456f-4f40-97d3-bd90a7108f51">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0a94b7f6-456f-4f40-97d3-bd90a7108f51</a>
 JBM: well it does come with a pixi exception
 Astrobytes: *happening with CG official multis
 struct: JBM I also have logo.png error on yinsh
 struct: But that is because I have no logo
 JBM: yeah totally CG's fault
 JBM: there's no rule that says you have to have a logo
 Astrobytes: I think maybe have a chat with Julien about it
 struct: imo logo looks ugly
 JBM: even less so how it'd be used
 struct: Im not a designer
 JBM: just document the damn thing
 struct: I cant even create good looking games
 Astrobytes: Unlike JBM
 Astrobytes: struct, Yinsh looks great, what are you on about
 JBM: my games are so good looking you can even adjust the colors to your taste
 JBM: i'm goingto end up writing up an SMB3-style intro in the end
 eulerscheZahl: added your links Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: and the HTML on some contributions is more screwed up than I thought. placing puzzles inside each other like Russian matroshka dolls
 Astrobytes: thanks eulerscheZahl, and lol, you can only nest so much you know
 eulerscheZahl: search for "euler" and keep expanding the last node :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha ffs
 Astrobytes: Skills man, skills :D
 eulerscheZahl: there is some missing close tab. i blame CG
 eulerscheZahl: tab =&gt; tag
 Astrobytes: Figured that one&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: at first i was confused why it said 24 results and only showed 6
 eulerscheZahl: took me a while to realize that it shows all of them
 Astrobytes: Just not in the expected manner

 jacek: ops
 struct: Whats this for jacek?
 eulerscheZahl: yinsh
 jacek: good it wasnt code
 Astrobytes: haha
 Astrobytes: wp jacek
 JBM: there you go, demo with no missing troll.png
 struct: jbm if you want to fix logo I guess a blank logo can fix it
 JBM: BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
 struct: o.o
 <b>**struct hides</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> JBM: i shouldn't have to guess what pngs i'm supposed to provide by trawling through the console error log!
 JBM: that's not how SDKs are supposed to work!
 Astrobytes: I'm inclined to agree lol
 Astrobytes: Still, the SDK is kind of a WIP
 JBM: i shouldn't have to be going through long cycles of trial and error to guess what subset of HTML they deemed real enough to pass
 Astrobytes: So feel free to keep pestering them with required updates
 eulerscheZahl: i always use version 3.x for WIP
 eulerscheZahl: see python3
 eulerscheZahl: starts to work around version 10
 JBM: i shouldn't have to synchronize my schedule with eZ to understand how turns work
 Astrobytes: Most of the tips for using the SDK are pretty much user-touser. With the odd technicality being verified by CG&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *user-to-user
 Astrobytes: And you're the best at complaining JBM, so keep doing that and it'll be perfectly usable in no time&#160;;)
 JBM: i'm not really complaining anymore
 JBM: just moaning
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl still awake? :O
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it works though
 JBM: just left
 JBM: not sure
 Astrobytes: His schedule is out-of-whack since lockdown Illedan :D
 Illedan: xD
 JBM: he doesn't even have lockdown
 JBM: he lives in a reasonable country
 Astrobytes: He's still working from home though
 JBM: yes, that's the being reasonable part
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Hey, it could be worse, you could all live in the UK
 JBM: yeah could be worse
 Astrobytes: Oh finally  my MRI scan date was confirmed btw \o/
 Astrobytes: Not that I'm looking forward to it or anything but I waited a while :P
 struct: When is it?
 Astrobytes: 16th
 Astrobytes: (this month)
 struct: How long have you waited for?
 Astrobytes: Over a month and a half now I believe
 Astrobytes: maybe slightly less
 Astrobytes: It's nuts. I've physically seen only one doctor (at hospital). Everything else (even with physiotherapist and neurosurgeon) has been phonecall only
 struct: Could be worse I guess with the current situation
 struct: How is it uk?
 struct: cases decreasing?
 Astrobytes: That's why it's taken so long etc. Normally pretty good round here.Well, govt are not stating true figues
 Astrobytes: *figures
 Astrobytes: (UK, not Scottish) so it's hard to say
 Astrobytes: They are concentrating on Brexit first and foremost
 struct: priorities 
 Astrobytes: And using the pandemic as a smokescreen
 struct: Here cases were going down, until they restarted opening stuff
 struct: now its slowly increasing again
 Astrobytes: Yep
 inoryy: &gt; Astrobytes 09:31PM&gt; Hey, it could be worse, you could &gt; all live in the UK
 struct: Why stuck 22+ hours inoryy?
 AntiSquid: hey inoryy how close are you to the London riots area&#160;?
 JBM: ph there are riots in UK?
 Astrobytes: inoryy Yeah, jeez dude, bless you man, you moved at *just* the wrong time!
 inoryy: struct lockdown + wfh = can't really go out
 AntiSquid: lol @ "uk cases decreasing", might get a second wave from london protests soon
 Astrobytes: All the advice from medical boards was *not* to ease lockdown because cases will increase again
 inoryy: AntiSquid you mean protests in hyde park and westminster? relatively far from that, I'm at kings cross
 AntiSquid: good
 Astrobytes: I mean our R0 in Scotland has just dropped to between 0.7 and 0.9, from 0.7 to 1.0, not sure on UK as a whole but that is not exactly an "ease the lockdown now" figure
 inoryy: did they really turn into riots?
 AntiSquid: watch videos
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid were you in London for the 2011 riots? Was fun... not
 AntiSquid: people are close to each other
 AntiSquid: no Astrobytes i lived in Bude back then
 AntiSquid: but seen the shit on TV
 Astrobytes: Bude!
 AntiSquid: ya
 JBM: watching the gamee, havin' a bude
 AntiSquid: 5 minutes from the beach :D
 Astrobytes: Nice man, nice
 AntiSquid: or cliffs
 AntiSquid: whichever :D
 Astrobytes: Cornwall's lovely, scenery-wise at least
 AntiSquid: i think it's overall safer area 
 AntiSquid: despite the "webbed feet" people keep talking about
 Astrobytes: Well, depends, now we have the "county-lines" drug-running
 Astrobytes: And the "webbed feet" type people you need to *really* watch for are the ones on the Isle of Wight :P
 AntiSquid: it was small community, most people knew each other
 Astrobytes: That can be a double-edged sword sometimes but it is nice
 inoryy: still not sure which videos you're referring to, seems relatively peaceful aside from some unrest near downing street
 AntiSquid: did i tell you about my next door neighbour? in bude i mean
 inoryy: i hope ppl wore masks though
 AntiSquid: ok here's the 2011 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/aug/05/englands-riots-five-years-on-it-was-off-the-scale-video">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/aug/05/englands-riots-five-years-on-it-was-off-the-scale-video</a> with a nice burning building
 inoryy: right... but that's 2011
 Astrobytes: What about your neighbour AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: there are stores being looted even in this riot
 AntiSquid: an apple store got looted
 Astrobytes: Meh. People loot every May Day anywy
 Astrobytes: *anyway
 AntiSquid: the main issue with this year's protest is how many people gather in close proximity and probably spread the virus <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghT0d5fbJ0U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghT0d5fbJ0U</a>
 AntiSquid: also some police men got beaten up inoryy
 Astrobytes: ffs, even Plod ain't wearing masks
 Astrobytes: (police)
 AntiSquid: as for my neighbour, the guy was selling drugs, it was stinking of that weird tea like smell in the corridor every time ... i hate that smell ... and he was totally screwed in the head, though acting nicely to his neighbours
 AntiSquid: the police visited a LOT
 Astrobytes: lol, probably worse down there now
 AntiSquid: for lots of different reasons, TV stolen, child support not paid, some granny downstairs died, noise complaints and other stuff, NEVER FOR THE DRUGS! 
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 jacek: again im lost at SO <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/59624/why-is-the-island-of-java-so-populated">https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/59624/why-is-the-island-of-java-so-populated</a>
 jacek: why isnt kotlin that populated
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: the java users are more fertile, see first comment jacek
 hydroglicerol: what?
 daffie: I found that kind of unsettling too seeing that even polioce were wearing no masks while shaking hands and being hurdled around by total strangers. 
 daffie: worst time for things like protests and gatherings
 daffie: I would not be surprised if most of them if not all of them are leftists though
 Astrobytes: Yeah but if you need to respond to a particular injustice or whatever, I'm all for protesting. Just use common sense ffs
 daffie: those kooks have and always will want to drive this country to disrepair
 AntiSquid: "ride together, die together"&#160;? :D
 Alshock: xD, yeah they're stealing our jobs and wives! :P
 AntiSquid: who&#160;?
 JBM: "these bastards"
 daffie: the burny sanders crowd
 Astrobytes: "Leftists" according to daffie
 Alshock: the leftists, the blocheviks, those who tamper with our food and run the world from the shadows&#160;;)
 Alshock: insert dramatic music here
 daffie: yes exactly
 Astrobytes: The US wouldn't know left-wing if it hit them in the face with the Little Red Book (no offence)
 AntiSquid: isn't one of the leftie complaints that american guys don't want to date american women which are strong idenpendent and instead get their wives from somewhere in asia&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It's just not how American politics is
 Alshock: xD I think I need to clarify the irony somehow
 JBM: i lost track of which country we were making fun f
 JBM: time 4 moar beerz
 Astrobytes: I just love the "leftist" thing
 AntiSquid: US&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Everywhere now
 AntiSquid: i mean some guys in US kneeled and caused world wide chaos
 Astrobytes: It's like anything other than shooting your neighbour because he asked for some sugar is Communist
 AntiSquid: i watched that video, that's like a public execution 
 Alshock: Astrobytes I mean it's common sense that coffee should be done with salt, he deserved it
 Astrobytes: All left-wingers/socialists are now extreme-feminists etc etc
 daffie: there's a difference between a woman who is strong and independent and some slutty teen on maurray flpping the bird to everyone proclaiming she's a grown ass woman
 Alshock: I'm affraid you're watching too much the media Astrobytes xD
 AntiSquid: he deserved it? i thought america moved away from the wild west times
 daffie: a lot of them are thinking they are
 Alshock: AntiSquid ain't it normal to kill people who like sugar no more? That's a crime against my freedom!
 AntiSquid: i was just reiterating leftie speech, not agreeing with it daffie
 Astrobytes: I don't take most media seriously Alshock
 daffie: I don't even watch the media anymore almost every day it's the same thing
 Astrobytes: I was brought up as a Socialist and I know what that is
 AntiSquid: i try my best to avoid the media and please correct me, but i see society is tending towards extremes, far left or far right
 Alshock: I'm nowhere near the USA, but I kinda can understand that.
 hydroglicerol: is it just me or do more of theese clash of code problems get harder by the second they should be tailored to my skill level
 Astrobytes: Socialism does not mean far-left, as conservatism does not mean far-right
 daffie: I think they're random aren't they&#160;?
 hydroglicerol: yah they are
 Alshock: I mean that's a given that when an extremist runs a country or leads the opposition, the other wing must radicalize too
 hydroglicerol: thats the problem
 Astrobytes: Unfortunately we have a toxic mix of the two, and anything moderate is labelled inappropriately
 Alshock: @Astrobytes I ain't ever seem any socialism in the US mix, you can sleep safe xD
 Alshock: seen*
 daffie: what amazes me is sometimes these AI bots will join the clash and end up solving it faster than me
 hydroglicerol: are you kiding have you met bernie sanders
 AntiSquid: Alshock your flag says france but i swear you sound like you are from US, i mean you seem to be in the know the way you talk 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Alshock, you know the US version of socialism I mean :PLike that 'Communist Bernie'&#160;:/
 Alshock: yes he is a one of a kind leftist in the US. Is he running for president again?
 daffie: he's always running for pres
 Astrobytes: Someone has to try and fix your broken politics :P
 hydroglicerol: he alwayys getss killed
 Alshock: @AntiSquid well I'm still just french ^^ but the US have an impact worldwide so we all know that country pretty well 
 hydroglicerol: because of how radical he is
 JBM: being reasonable is now rad
 Astrobytes: You know, Bernie is only 'radical' in the US
 Alshock: Sorry my english is bad, I meant to say that he never makes it to the actual election
 daffie: more worried about sleepy joe at this point
 hydroglicerol: that in and of itself is pretty strang I mean I have no idea who the british prime minister is or was
 Astrobytes: He's still conservative to the rest of the world
 Astrobytes: But with some heart
 AntiSquid: no i mean, you sound confident about what you say to the point it makes me thing you are from US
 hydroglicerol: besides churchhill obviously
 Astrobytes: Then you're ignorant hydroglicerol
 hydroglicerol: I guess
 Astrobytes: No offence
 daffie: plague johnson
 hydroglicerol: but its more of the fact that no one actually talks about it in the Us
 Astrobytes: No, the US is so ridiculously insular
 JBM: us never really talks about anything but us
 Astrobytes: It's getting that way here now too
 hydroglicerol: dont get me wrong I know the important global history 98 on the regent 
 hydroglicerol: but modern times dont make us share things which are unimportant for reason of "that was random " or "who cares"
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3LDZSWCkJw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3LDZSWCkJw</a> regarding boris, i find it funny people go to the window at specific time of the day and say boo
 hydroglicerol: its just a cycle which dosnt really end untill you either meet s/o who is intrested or become intrested yourself
 Alshock: @JBM that's not quite true, US president have talked about countries they want to make war to for more than half a century now
 hydroglicerol: I mean does anyone here know the leader of mexico rite now
 Astrobytes: lol Alshock
 JBM: and then tried to put them on a map
 Astrobytes: Somebody Obrador
 JBM: we call those "CNN maps" now
 Astrobytes: ^Mexico
 Astrobytes: I forgot his name&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Anyway, nice chatting guys
 Astrobytes: I shall bid you all goodnight
 JBM: gn
 AntiSquid: kinda true, i remember the "axis of evil" from bush times
 JBM: and those WMDs
 hydroglicerol: not bad
 Alshock: 'night
 hydroglicerol: Andrés Manuel López Obrador
 AntiSquid: North Korea has no oil, so no invasion
 Alshock: Nope, there was korea before, and vietnam before that, and cuba, and... 
 AntiSquid: i mean more recently
 Alshock: korea was before vietnam and I'm just stupid right?
 AntiSquid: oil related wars 
 K4Mx: so this chat is hidden on discord&#160;? 
 inoryy: it's a different protocol
 K4Mx: damn&#160;:(
 inoryy: you can probably write a bot to relay between the two 
 K4Mx: less fun than an AI
 K4Mx: (:
 Alshock: I must admit I never go to discord, anything interesting there?
 K4Mx: less activity i guess
 AntiSquid: chat history stays up forever so ...
 Alshock: x) "that's a quiet and relaxing place"
 AntiSquid: also you got chat by category, not all mixed in one
 K4Mx: this website is awesome
 K4Mx: wanted to say that x)
 K4Mx: or better saying the project
 jacek: aww
 K4Mx: can we save persistent files on the machine we have through games&#160;? 
 K4Mx: or sometimes the machine are reset etc
 Alshock: well you can't even be sure to be on the same machine
 K4Mx: using wget&#160;? or the machine is locked down
 Alshock: so I guess you can't
 Alshock: locked to avoid external computation
 Alshock: but my knowledge of the VM is close to 0
 AntiSquid: it's not there to protect CG from us, it's to protect us from Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i also have a prune array.
 Alshock: he prunes all fellow codingamers that fall beneath his scythe of Doom
 Alshock: don't you Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: depending on the problem at hand
 Alshock: See?
 AntiSquid: that's ceg's thing, prune array, he picked it up quite fast
 AntiSquid: just few days old
 K4Mx: xD
 K4Mx: what about max turn on Onitama&#160;? there is none&#160;? 
 K4Mx: nvm
 K4Mx: 200 
 MostComplicatedUsername: Nice Troll vs Castles has been improved
 JBM: has it?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Interesting question
 MostComplicatedUsername: I sank from 28 to 41 without doing anything&#160;:(
 JBM: you probably have your game input section to review
 hydroglicerol: yikes
 MostComplicatedUsername: yES
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes*
 MostComplicatedUsername: More variables
 hydroglicerol: I feel like theese questions on the "clash of code" are not exactly for beginers
 MostComplicatedUsername: Example?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff77e00b-5e7a-4197-8838-70726c816312">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff77e00b-5e7a-4197-8838-70726c816312</a>
 hydroglicerol: there making me use ^ which I havnt lernt and I took the AP
 hydroglicerol: as well as~~
 MostComplicatedUsername: What are you trying to do? Is it giving the wrong output? Or are you getting an error?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: KeyError: 'hidden'
 MostComplicatedUsername: Is that the whole thing?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: yes
 MostComplicatedUsername: chr and ord are functions?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: python
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well I have no idea what chr() and ord() do so I can't help you :sweat_smile:
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: chr converts ascii number to character
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: and ord converts character to ascii number
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh
 MostComplicatedUsername: What exactly are you hoping to accomplish by adding ord(x) to a[c]?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: cypher code
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: anyways the clash is over anyways
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol Im doing something else too so Im just checking back here every 10 min
 MostComplicatedUsername: I'm 4th place in troll vs castles!
 Uljahn: i see no wrapping of a char code when greater than "z"
 Uljahn: i mean cycle through the alphabet
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: oh
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have to have a team for the contest???
 soloyolo97: Hello! new to coding, and trying to get a hang of the java language. Has anyone else had trouble trying to wrap their head around all this?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: no
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol
 MostComplicatedUsername: "no"
 c0cainee: java is for boomers
 MostComplicatedUsername: ikr
 MostComplicatedUsername: Python is the best programming language
 soloyolo97: why so?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Because it is
 K4Mx: ok, so im listing availalbe libraries in python with sys.modules.keys(), however this list is not exhaustive , example: numpy is not lised, how i can list all available libraries for real from code&#160;? 
 soloyolo97: i'm just trying to learn the most valuble language 
 Alshock: standard language trolling soloyolo97 ^^
 c0cainee: learn python then, it's the easiest one
 MostComplicatedUsername: soloyolo97 python is way easier to read/understand
 Alshock: ofc everyone know Pascal is the best language 
 MostComplicatedUsername: ewww pascal
 Alshock: Maybe Ada is slightly better
 Alshock: Or is it Cobol?
 soloyolo97: sweet! Thanks for the info. The internet was saying java, but i'd rather listen to ppl who've actually been doing this for awhile.
 Alshock: no
 Alshock: you shouldn't listen to anyone who answers an incomplete question
 JBM: clojure's all the rage nowadays
 Alshock: languages all have their interest in some aspects. Except for Haskell, that one is just a joke :P
 JBM: dare i say a troll
 Alshock: Should we throw stones at it?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Jbm clojure is ewwww
 MostComplicatedUsername: Python is the best programming language
 JBM: you seem like a very ewwwy person
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;?
 JBM: have you heard about the correlation with voting republican?
 MostComplicatedUsername: What's that supposed to mean
 Alshock: have you ever looked up python's performances though?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes but he/she is beginning
 JBM: it means you ewww a lot
 Alshock: do you think it's always the best idea to start learning with a weak-typed, strong magic language?
 Alshock: @JBM does that mean he should code in webasm?
 Alshock: that sounds like a great pick
 JBM: ewww
 Alshock: aw noes, he infected you! D:
 Alshock: quarantine for both of you! I don't want to have it too, that'd be so awful, ewww
 JBM: you don't want to have quarantine?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Alshock I'm a she
 Alshock: are we seriously mentally regressing as time flies by? xD
 Alshock: Oh yeah I remember I heard you  say that one 
 Alshock: I'm sorry, I have no excuse
 K4Mx: any machine learning library for python available&#160;? 
 Alshock: you mean on the server?
 JBM: used to be tensorflow around
 K4Mx: yes i cannot list exactly the availalbe module
 Alshock: there was a tensorflow puzzle at least
 JBM: not sure it's still there
 K4Mx: sys.modules.keys() is not exhaustive
 K4Mx: since numpy is not listed but available
 Alshock: Includes NumPy 1.16.2, pandas 0.24.2, SciPy 1.2.1
 K4Mx: help modules is too big for error stream or something
 Alshock: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Alshock: it doesn't say anything about python2 though, does CG not support it anymore?
 K4Mx:  No module named 'tensorflow' 
 K4Mx: T.T
 Alshock: @JBM they forfeited the machine learning puzzles thing entirely? I can't find that tensorflow puzzle where you had to C/C the code given to you
 JBM: yes it wasn't on the platform too long
 Alshock: C/C xD I'm speaking french unwillingly now, I blame tireness
 K4Mx: wellif you know how to list available modules from inside machine i ll take it 
 K4Mx: i mean the exhaustive one
 Alshock: help('modules') could maybe help?
 K4Mx: output is not fitting in the game buffer xD
 Alshock: ^^ obviously
 Alshock: But there's only the default that comes with python3,  NumPy 1.16.2, pandas 0.24.2, and SciPy 1.2.1
 Alshock: that's it I think
 K4Mx: there are more
 K4Mx: no&#160;? 
 K4Mx: want to be sure x)
 Alshock: No, I think the default modules are listed here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html">https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html</a>not so sure though
 K4Mx: ok i got the list
 K4Mx: printin 1000 char at once xD
 Alshock: xD gj
 K4Mx: " tensorboard " 
 K4Mx: still not exhaustive
 K4Mx: numpy is not listed
 K4Mx: damn 
 K4Mx: and machine is kinda locked down for listing folders
 Alshock: it's listing the libraries that are not expicitely added to python
 Alshock: Wild guess though, I have no backup for that one
 Uljahn: you can navigate to python folder on CG and check files
 Alshock: lol beat the wood boss by 0.05 with a boss that doesn't acknoledge the opponent's existence
 K4Mx: still no numpy in folders
 K4Mx: from paths
 K4Mx: so i dont know how it is loaded&#160;: ) 
 Alshock: why does it matter though?
 K4Mx: to know exactly which modules are available for coding
 Alshock: you know it is and you know the version, what do you specifically need from the folders?
 Uljahn: import subprocesssh = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)print(sh(f"ls -l /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/").decode('utf-8'))
 Uljahn: try this in IDE
 K4Mx: yes and numpy is not inside
 K4Mx: albeit import numpy works
 Uljahn: drwxr-sr-x 18 root root 600 Mar 20 17:02 numpy
 Alshock: I don't understand, if you were focused on any other package I could get it
 Alshock: but numpy is explicitely described in the FAQ
 K4Mx: i am
 Alshock: what more do you need from it's source file?
 K4Mx: im lookin for tensorflow alternative
 Alshock: aw
 Uljahn: there is none on CG
 Alshock: I guess you're good to create your own lightweight library with numpy then?
 Uljahn: yep
 Alshock: maybe there are some recipes available out there?
 K4Mx: scipy rather if need to recreate all no&#160;? 
 Alshock: you know that way better than I do x)
 K4Mx: ls was trucanting output x) 
 K4Mx: no i know nothing
 K4Mx: that it was i needed a lib 
 Alshock: hello john snow
 K4Mx: xD

 K4Mx: ok so in the end its accurate faq xD
 Uljahn: ye
 Zenoscave: I was dethroned!
 Zenoscave: Oh inputs changed
 Zenoscave: huzzah
 Uljahn: pewpewed
 Zenoscave: nearly perfect submit
 jdsfklsd: bread
 daffie: the weekly isn't clear. what is the unknown blood type supposed to be for? their child? or othe other possible bloodtypes they could have?
 jdsfklsd: Not to be controversial but I thought linear algebra was ass
 jdsfklsd: Thank you for coming to my ted talk
 SimonLandry: Linear algebra is very important though
 jdsfklsd: I know
 jdsfklsd: that's what sucks
 SimonLandry: I thought it wasn't too bad
 SimonLandry: you just have to practice a lot
 daffie: nevermind I get it now
 daffie: each line represents 2 parents and their child, one of them will be unknown and needs to be deduced from the other two family members
 jdsfklsd: I know they teach linear algebra in some high schools but I can't believe it myself
 jdsfklsd: I thought it was gonna be a normal math class but it was like 90% theory

 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: a=input()b=a.countprint(f'{b('A')} {b('C')} {b('G')} {b('T')}')
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: why this dont work
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: nvm
 hydroglicerol: this is so biased against java
 hydroglicerol: literaly everything is biased against java WTF
 hydroglicerol: its so unfair
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: lol
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: werent u in my game
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: xd
 hydroglicerol: allways
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: python3 op
 hydroglicerol: yah thats what Im noticing
 hydroglicerol: I mean I still find it intresting but its impossible to win
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: why do i keep seeing the same 5 people
 hydroglicerol: its very strange for example to make it slightly more fareI should get paired to others who use java butnooooooo
 hydroglicerol: ppython 3 
 hydroglicerol: wrecks everyone else
 hydroglicerol: and there is always one in your game 
 hydroglicerol: like you for eg
 hydroglicerol: also why does literallly no one know how to use the chat
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: ikr
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: wtf
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: why does it make me do a captcha
 hydroglicerol: it justed started rite
 hydroglicerol: they are so annoying
 hydroglicerol: "find the taxis" I KNOW WHAT AFUCKIN TAXI LOOKS LIKE
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: ffs
 WINWINWIN: hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj a couple of people made bots that could join and clash on their behalf. Imagine trying to clash when someone joins and finishes every clash in 1 second?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: bruh
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: couldnt they just do the bot
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: after they do the captcha themselves
 hydroglicerol: I her but the point of the new repatcha is to make us not to have to do those annoying quizzezz which it sometimes works but mostly no
 hydroglicerol: *e
 WINWINWIN: hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj does not work like that
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: recommendations for coding battles?
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: the prime questions are so annoying
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: because there arent any built in prime checkers for python
 WINWINWIN: ruby has a prime module
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: i dont know ruby
 WINWINWIN: write this line in the beginning of your code
 WINWINWIN: require'prime'
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: i dont know ruby

 ZVRKK: hi
 Tuan2.le: Can anyone help me know how to simply evaluate the best move?  
 zenwraight: There is no right way to evaluate the best move, it's going to be relative 
 DetoBot: PatrickMcGinnisII, damn :joy:
 Tuan2.le: Yes! I know, but this is the first time I do something like this  compete. I saw many people mention "beam search". So, I'm not sure what it is. So, can anyone take a short time explain how "beam search" is implemented to this problem? Just ideal, not in details?
 DetoBot: open that Silver now :rage:
 icecream17: my time is 11:38pm :p
 SirLoxley: Is the current nutrients value visible on the screen (or do I have to stderr it for debugging)?
 icecream17: settings icon &gt; debug mode
 SirLoxley: that was easy&#160;:-) thanks
 BrunoFelthes: SirLoxley, you can point a tree, it will show how much this tree is worth
 Smelty: hi
 MADDY-1: hi Smelty
 UndercoverToad: good morning
 MADDY-1: gm
 icecream17: gn
 MADDY-1: gn
 icecream17: also, people are using shadows somehow - hmmm
 icecream17: yay! my submit improved my ranking
 icecream17: dang, i just lost 4 in a row
 Lysk: submit again!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when silver opens, a complete rewrite is gonna happen
 icecream17: lol
 icecream17: no! stop losing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ugh, and i have to work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gn
 Chainman: so shadows are set at start of day and do not change?
 jrke: the use of shadow is only to get sunpoints that you get on new day so no use of updating in between a day
 MindController: Does anyone know how can it be that when i cerr I dont get timeout but when i dont cerr I get timeout(C++)
 ZarthaxX: cerr may change registers low level that make your bot dont timeout later
 ZarthaxX: it's related to how calls are made prob in low level asm stuff
 lainislain: haloo do someone know how much memory we can use ingame  ?
 ZarthaxX: it's in faq
 ZarthaxX: think it was like 768mb ish
 lainislain: ah thank u
 ZarthaxX: yw
 MindController: So the problem was with my variable name "size"
 ZarthaxX: f
 LLG: is there any way to get all cells that are within a certain distance from another cell?
 LLG: for example I want to get all cells within a 2 unit radius of cell 0
 algeo: how can i reply a message in forum
 MindController: LLG u have to check neighbours of neighbours
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: LLG you can use the neigbours from the input and loop through them twice
 algeo: oh i see the forum is closed
 MADDY-1: click on reply algeo
 azriel1rf: how can i print message to display in a game
 algeo: error output
 algeo: oh sorry
 algeo: space + message
 azriel1rf: In Python, this wouldn't work
 azriel1rf: ah
 algeo: print("WAIT", "i know c++")
 azriel1rf: space + message, ok
 azriel1rf: thanks alot
 algeo: :relieved:
 MindController: Action + space + message should work, yes
 SabertheLost: Why is a tree that get no sun casting a shadow? Makes no sense to me. 
 azriel1rf: it's natural for me
 azriel1rf: |Ôºº|Ôºº
 aangairbender: wow got top37 using some ifs :joy:
 azriel1rf: not fully get sun -&gt; spooky
 azriel1rf: without any searching&#160;?
 aangairbender: yes, no searching/simulation
 azriel1rf: fantastic
 aangairbender: using shadows btw
 azriel1rf: how many days do you count shadow?
 UndercoverToad: till the end of the game
 azriel1rf: lol
 aangairbender: I count 3 days (to see how my seed becomes a size-3 tree)
 aangairbender: so I count how many times it will be in a shadow
 azriel1rf: ah, that's great
 aangairbender: not taking into an account opponent tree actually
 aangairbender: so my bot plays kinda singleplayer game
 aangairbender: even when calculating shadows
 VizGhar: LOL 211 rank... I don't even know how did I get there :D
 The_ZimaBlue: In CoCs what is a stub generator input?
 azriel1rf: I only think for growing. grow casts shadow longly. whether that is for my tree or opponent's tree. 
 VizGhar: a stub? I don't know id i understand
 VizGhar: The_ZimaBlue what exactly you want to know?
 MadKnight: ez
 VizGhar: If somebody creates CoC contribution they have to write the stub for puzzle...
 The_ZimaBlue: I was making a Coc and they were asking for a stub generator input
 UndercoverToad: stub generator: some pseudocode that gets translated to the initial code for all languages supported by codingame
 MadKnight: wow my ez was WAY too late
 VizGhar: you were making CoC contribution?
 The_ZimaBlue: yup... for the xp xD
 UndercoverToad: click the questionmark to see syntax examples how it works
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 so many new faces...
 The_ZimaBlue: ok, thx
 Automaton2000: so i can stay in the same miniboard you are playing on the same round, the nth zombie killed's worth ...
 MadKnight: i mean avatars
 M1kep: I assume the quest map is probably the best place to start?
 VizGhar: M1kep depends, but most of the times yes
 VizGhar: I finally got the concept of small improvements... I'm rank ~150 and still know how to improve my bot o.O
 VizGhar: so i beat struc t o.O
 Chainman: how do you convert cube_coords to cell_index.  
 Chainman: Are there any clever methods?
 VizGhar: what cube_coords?
 Chainman: (x,y,z)
 Chainman: Basically the cubecoords defined here, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java</a>
 Chainman: the hashcode doesn't do anything useful afaik. 
 VizGhar: try this&#160;:)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/</a>
 jolindien: look at BoardGenerator.java
 Chainman: yeah I used that blog to understand a little 
 aangairbender: I won dbdr once, feels good
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 aangairbender: btw dbdr you have any kind of simulation? (if its not a secret ofc)
 dbdr: yes, I do a beam search
 LLG: how many sims are you able to do in 100ms
 LLG: I'm still struggling with optimizing my sims
 aangairbender: I see, well, I just spectated bunch of your games and wrote bunch of 'ifs' that make similar moves
 dbdr: something like 250K
 LLG: wow
 UndercoverToad: i'm more at 20k&#160;:(
 Ajaiy2: Im really glad I used a good algorithm at wood 1
 Ajaiy2: Its really helping me at bronze
 Ajaiy2: Not fully though
 aangairbender: 250k of state+action-&gt;new stateor 250k of full playouts to the end?
 LLG: I still don't know how to diagnose my sims to see which part is eating up my time üò¢
 dbdr:  250k of state+action-&gt;new state
 dbdr: UndercoverToad use a real language&#160;;)
 aangairbender: I have simulation ready, but havent used it yet. Will try to write beam search as well
 aangairbender: haha rust rules
 dbdr: but more seriously, I think your eval is more expensive
 UndercoverToad: probably, simulating all days till the end costs some time
 LLG: in my case my eval isn't really expensive since I haven't gotten round to that part yet
 UndercoverToad: even simulating twice in some cases
 LLG: it's just MyScore + TreeScore 
 dbdr: twice?
 LLG: with TreeScore being the sum of tree sizes and soil richness
 UndercoverToad: for seeding i test a grown up tree as well to see the impact early
 dbdr: aha
 LLG: I think the process of cloning a state is expensive for me atm
 LLG: but I have no idea how to test that theory üò¢
 Marchete: it's your evals expensive? I'm seeing some possible evals (grid related) but they are expensive
 aangairbender: oh, I remembered that for beam search I need to come up with some eval function. The one in the Fall challenge was easy though
 aangairbender: did anybody use neural network/genetic algo for tuning eval function locally?
 aangairbender: I mean not this time but anytime before as well
 UndercoverToad: param tuning is something you usually do later when it gets close to the end of the contest
 M1kep: Sigh, I've wasted like an hour and half cause I forgot ^ wan't an exponent in JS -_-
 Marchete: that's xor in a lot of languages
 bvego: looking at my code for the last 20 minutes wondering why it isn't working, turned out I used Math.max(angle) instead of Math.abs(angle) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 <b>**UndercoverToad uses ^ in the bot on purpose</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> M1kep: LOl
 M1kep: *Lol
 LLG: don't we all
 M1kep: Yeah I deal a lot with APIs and practically zero math stuff
 UndercoverToad: at least those of us who are bitboarding the game
 Marchete: I use xor to disable a bit 
 Marchete: instead of &amp; ~bit
 Marchete: but nothing else...
 M1kep: The only time I used bitwise operations was when i was needing to use bitmasks for storing Zoom user info data in an Active Directory field.
 Marchete: bitboards are "fun"
 Marchete: if you are into these kinky amusements
 [MK]: how can I redo a question unfinished in clash of codes?
 UndercoverToad: search it here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 [MK]: thank you very much i found it
 UndercoverToad: was it this one? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1462c7bd45e5d5bc2c375166880f72a4d2fe">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1462c7bd45e5d5bc2c375166880f72a4d2fe</a>
 jrke: looks i need to setup referee offline to play many games
 [MK]: yup
 UndercoverToad: codingame changed their constraints for IDE plays
 Marchete: what constraints?
 UndercoverToad: how many games you can play in X minutes/hours
 dbdr: number of allowed matches per unit of time
 UndercoverToad: oh, how eloquent
 dbdr: and slow
 TobiasA: wait you can play the game offline with all the inputs and stuff?
 UndercoverToad: the referee is public. you can download and play vs yourself
 UndercoverToad: or you write all the input directly to stderr. and then reproduce a specific turn offline
 TobiasA: so the refree gives all the inputs?
 M1kep: This seems like it may give some insight? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/what-is-exactly-the-referee-and-so-engine/39234">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/what-is-exactly-the-referee-and-so-engine/39234</a>

 M1kep: Only supports Java?
 jrke: nope any lang
 jrke: "lang", dir
 UndercoverToad: it just spawns a separate process
 M1kep: Ahhh I se
 M1kep: I'm probably going to stick to the quest table for this one
 UndercoverToad: there are only 2 contests a year, this is a rare opportunity
 M1kep: Ahhhh
 M1kep: Well
 M1kep: Time to do that I guess lol
 Chainman: what is the strategy with shadowmasks?
 Chainman: I know how every day the shadow gets set, and if a tree is harvest, the shadow remains for that day.
 Ajaiy2: I am on 189 lines of code and it works kinda good
 Chainman: Can a tree be update from spooky to not spooky during the day, if you grow it?
 AceTea: At what time is the silver league opening&#160;? Any idea&#160;?
 Ajaiy2: Don't know
 Chainman: if tree size 2 casts shadow on tree size 2, but you grow the tree to size 3, is it not spooky anymore?
 Chainman: Okay I check it is true it will become not spooky
 Chainman: Only spooky as long as tree size&lt;=shadow size
 Chainman: While shadow size is fixed for the entire day, the tree size can change, and allows a tree to change spookiness state.
 LLG: lmao
 LLG: my sims went from 1k to 10k just by fixing my hash function
 Michael_Howard: AceTea probably 6pm CET
 UndercoverToad: CEST
 UndercoverToad: it's summer
 UndercoverToad: and you dropped my score despite losing to me :rage:
 LLG: do your own trees' shadows prevent your other trees from generating suns?
 DetoBot: yes
 DetoBot: shadows are shadows
 FatIvan: Where are people expecting the first cutoff for silver today?
 LLG: I haven't gotten round to bitboarding shadows yet
 LLG: maybe I should
 Michael_Howard: UndercoverToad it was my first game but that still seems weird. But on the bright side it answers my question about why I tend to always lose the first one.
 Chainman: bitboarding shadows, what I need.
 UndercoverToad: the first game is always vs top10% of the league
 UndercoverToad: and from the 500 candidates you got me
 Michael_Howard: It probably raised your variance œÉ, lowering your R = mu - 3*sigma.
 UndercoverToad: it's a known feature of Trueskill
 UndercoverToad: even mentioned in the FAQ
 RoboStac: it's easy to stop it happening - just don't be near the top of the leaderboard&#160;:)
 Michael_Howard: Yeah, hopefully soon UndercoverToad you'll be able to return the favour&#160;:)
 VizGhar: UndercoverToad that account is simply because of lagging chat?
 sgalasso: Hey everyone I struggle with the scoring in a MCTS, how may I normalize a score for using it in the UCT if you don't know what is the best score of your nodes&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: yes VizGhar
 UndercoverToad: and some fell for it and didn't realize it's me
 VizGhar: its because you are undercover
 VizGhar: pathetic lvl3
 Donald_D._Doge: hey i take offence in that
 VizGhar: well sorry
 Donald_D._Doge: sorry wont fix it
 VizGhar: ok... so not sorry
 UndercoverToad: then how about you fixing it by leveling up? :P
 Donald_D._Doge: i can't believe the level of discrimination level 3s face in here
 VizGhar: hope you understand this is all joke
 UndercoverToad: and I was just joining the joke
 Donald_D._Doge: level 3s are a joke? i am feeling opressed
 aangairbender: sgalasso you can store lowest and highest score for tree, then normalize any node score between them
 aangairbender: this technique is described in the article about Smitsimax
 cegprakash: is the seed action free of cost?
 Donald_D._Doge: check statement, it tells you
 Tiramon: no cost amount of size 0 trees presen
 Tiramon: so first is free
 cegprakash: Donald_D._Doge it's not in statement
 Donald_D._Doge: it is
 cegprakash: so stop trolling ppl
 Donald_D._Doge: you're trolling yourself
 cegprakash: thank u so much Tiramon
 cegprakash: ignore if u don't wanna answer
 cegprakash: don't insult ppl
 Tiramon: To perform a seed action, you must pay sun points equal to the number of seeds (size 0 trees) you already own in the forest.
 Tiramon: that is from the statement btw&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: "To perform a seed action, you must pay sun points equal to the number of seeds (size 0 trees) you already own in the forest. "
 AntiSquid: it is in the statement
 aangairbender: dbdr what collection do you use for priority queue in rust?
 Tiramon: you are to slow AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: cegprakash quote the part of the statement
 AntiSquid: quoted *
 AntiSquid: "don't insult people reeee" straight up trolling imo
 derjack: oO
 Tiramon: by now i havn't found any rule that i snot in the statement
 Chainman: true
 UndercoverToad: richness rings and map generation aren't part of the statement
 Tiramon: ok ...
 Tiramon: oh and cell index are also not in the statement ... what i really missed a bit
 UndercoverToad: (thinking hard to find something that isn't there, but not really relevant to be described either)
 UndercoverToad: cell index is in debug view but a picture could help
 derjack: shadows only matter in the beginning of day
 dbdr: aangairbender Vec
 aangairbender: yeah, I was trying to come with with some priority queue and then understood that there's no need
 aangairbender: vec should be fine
 philRG: Tiramon: good practice to master gameplay is to recode the actions of the referee
 UndercoverToad: Tiramon has that move generation and applying already
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: best language to implement search trees/simulation/bitboards?
 olaf_surgut: C++
 aangairbender: rust or c++
 aangairbender: I prefer rust for less debugging
 aangairbender: cause its easy to mess up with c++
 philRG: aangairbender well it can help sometimes before diving into trees/simulations/bitboards to understand game mechanism&#160;:-)
 philRG: just a remark for everybody in fact
 aangairbender: I wrote simulation first to understand game mechanism
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I've never tried rust. I'll have a look. thanks
 IMpactz: Hello there
 aangairbender: NotSureWhyThisWorks rust might be hard to use for the first time though
 dbdr: rust needs an investment to learn. it's worth it in the long term though&#160;:)
 ddreams: are you simulating the opponent too, dbdr?
 dbdr: no
 UndercoverToad: dbdr you ate the chat logs from the day before yesterday
 ddreams: you're doing beam search as well?
 aangairbender: I am writing beam search now, I am making opponent always WAIT:sweat_smile:
 UndercoverToad: me? yes, beam
 dbdr: beam
 Marchete: wait a minute
 ddreams: same here
 Marchete: nvm :D
 ddreams: though probably a much dumber evaluation function than you guys
 UndercoverToad: that wasn't even a minute
 Marchete: how it's possible you don't simulate enemies?
 Marchete: I mean
 cipryyyy: gang shit no lame shit
 Marchete: not even first turns?
 xMizar: Hi, do you know when new leagues for spring challenge will be created?
 UndercoverToad: i simulate shadows cast
 derjack: or make them WAIT actions
 UndercoverToad: but not guessing any opponent actions
 UndercoverToad: yes, just WAIT
 dbdr: same
 ddreams: yeah, the opponent does nothing in my case either
 UndercoverToad: timing for selling trees is a nightmare
 ddreams: not even wait, just completely ignore him
 Marchete: I still can't believe that...
 ddreams: or her, as it may be
 Marchete: it's like playing HS or CSB with WAIT enemies
 ddreams: I assume you guys have bitboards?
 ddreams: I'm only getting like 13k evaluations per round
 RoboStac: it's not like the enemy can do anything too bad to you here (HS you have to simulate a couple of enemy moves to check for traps but beyond that it seems pretty pointless)
 Marchete: that's why I said at least first turns
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/Vgj00VS">https://ibb.co/Vgj00VS</a>
 Chainman: I found a diamond pickaxe
 Marchete: but if both 3 of you are top10 and you say that enemy simulation is not needed
 Marchete: I believe you ofc :D
 IMpactz: is this chat real or just boted
 ddreams: how can chat be real if our eyes aren't real?
 VizGhar: what is exact time of opening silver league?
 RoboStac: admittedly I'm not doing beam search because I thought it would be a problem but I'm starting to think I should change
 limakk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://blueorangegames.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PHOTOSYNTHESIS_rules_UK.pdf?x75567">https://blueorangegames.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PHOTOSYNTHESIS_rules_UK.pdf?x75567</a>
 ddreams: so what are you doing?
 Donald_D._Doge: IMpactz welcome to bot chat please prove you're a bot by answering in 1 ms
 RoboStac: getting very annoyed at being stuck just outside the top 20 
 RoboStac:&#160;:(
 kovi: i thought smitsi is the way to go, but i'm still heuristic...and probably end up beam...
 Marchete: I was thinking about doing MCTS-ept to be true (just doing the sim at even turns)
 Marchete: but I'm in doubt
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Marchete or the top 10 are all trying to throw everyone else off lol
 IMpactz: ddreams we are all just a fading reality
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: I trust that damn toad and dbd_r
 ddreams: I was doing mcts in fall but failed spectacularly
 IMpactz: uff
 Marchete: mcts and failed it's a common relationship :D
 AllGoodNamesRGone: I just read some article about beam search but don't know why this algo can use in this contest. What can I do with probability. Can anyone help
 ddreams: here, this is a good guide: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem">https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem</a>
 struct: you are reading the wrong type
 struct: of beam search
 Marchete: he did a beam search for opponent too
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search</a>
 struct: its a bfs with pruning
 Marchete: also pb_4 did an opponent search
 ddreams: still in bronze though, probably legends will do something like that
 Michael_Howard: RoboStac, interesting... what kind of traps are you checking for?
 Marchete: I don't know any search without taking into account the enemy at all will be incoherent in 2 turns at most
 Marchete: probably it can be reduced with seeding first
 Marchete: move ordering to leave grow at later depths
 Marchete: that doesn't change anything in the same day
 kovi: i also did opponent beam in fall...
 Marchete: and this game seems to have more interactions between players
 Marchete: it's a shared board
 kovi: better to predict opponent and the world (no outside randomness)but more depth
 ddreams: wonder what the maximum amount of moves is
 ddreams: not that it changes anything
 struct: higher than 100
 ddreams: I think you may be onto something
 struct: if you and opponent each have 100 moves its 100^2
 struct: states
 ddreams: is there any usual cutoff point for silver?
 struct: I would say 20% max will pass
 ddreams: 5k players, so maybe around 1k then
 VizGhar: Hope I can finish this one in legend
 Marchete: you are 100th, you have good chances
 VizGhar: ah struc t I've seen you low today... no time?
 VizGhar: tnx
 VizGhar: never been this high in any bot coding contest... I'll update my bol and fail misserably dont you worry
 struct: I have a better bot I think
 struct: but ill wait until silver opens
 struct: It has 65% win rate vs my arena one
 ddreams: why wait?
 struct: If it was 90%+ I would have submited already
 Dorimon: Anyone knows how do I move from Bronze league to Silver?
 Dorimon: In CSB
 Salmoneer: Any tips for getting levels?

 botbtw33: wait what?
 DetoBot: My bot got some courage to rise 300+ ranks
 DetoBot: :unamused:
 Sheytoon: when next league opens?
 jrke: today
 UndercoverToad: in 5 hours
 AntiSquid: question is how many promote
 AntiSquid: Deton what's the issue with rising in ranks&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: rising = higher number = more in front of you = bad
 AntiSquid: also anyone wants to share their sim count? :P (ply whatever you want to call it)
 Michael_Howard: 0
 UndercoverToad: watch my replays, I print it
 jacek: you could troll print
 DetoBot: Ah not that
 UndercoverToad: node count is before filtering duplicates. but i do my best to avoid generating them in the first place
 DetoBot: I mean getting closer to the top
 AntiSquid: is d depth 9&#160;? or days&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: euler
 UndercoverToad: depth in days
 AntiSquid: ah
 Marchete: 9 days is a lot of simulations
 AntiSquid: i generate too many for sure
 UndercoverToad: i think i should go more for width. but that requires more coding not to time out in other turns
 UndercoverToad: 9 is overkill
 AntiSquid: 200k / turn :D
 AntiSquid: i guess my selection is crap
 UndercoverToad: i count is low. but i have an expensive eval
 UndercoverToad: and some thought put in generation already
 AntiSquid: super cheap eval here
 UndercoverToad: eval = WAIT till the end and count suns (among other)
 AntiSquid: generate all 
 DomiKo: with super cheap and no prunning I got like 1.5MLN / 100ms
 DomiKo: but sim count means nothing 
 UndercoverToad: that's because you are smarter than me and know how to code
 UndercoverToad: in the end you'll get me again
 Marchete: 1.5 million?
 DomiKo: yes
 Marchete: wowo
 DomiKo: a lot of seeds
 UndercoverToad: i can't even generate that fast
 aangairbender: my first attempt on beam search didnt go well:sweat_smile:
 Marchete: why simcount means nothing?
 UndercoverToad: beam is a bit tricky because of variable amount of actions per day
 AntiSquid: with 1.5 mil you can get a good accurate average of best path to take
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: like 1 armed bandit puzzle @_@
 Marchete: and probably because move ordering inside the day is important
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: you need to prune a lot
 Scarfield: you could make a variable width beam i suppose?
 UndercoverToad: meh to the move order
 DomiKo: and then sim count is much lower
 AntiSquid: is red at advantage over blue&#160;?
 Marchete: move generation is slow too for me
 aangairbender: how you calculate sim count?do you generate all actions, pick random one and transition into new state?
 Marchete: and eval...
 UndercoverToad: for me it's the number of individual nodes I generate
 cegprakash: AntiSquid both players play simultaneously
 aangairbender: I am writing code to test perfomance of simulation only. (without beam search etc)
 UndercoverToad: &gt; you could make a variable width beam i suppose?
 Scarfield: hmm, boards are mirrored, but the shadows are different. could be actually
 Zenoscave: A reagular beam search out preforms my chokudai
 Zenoscave: Perhaps I have too large a state so the sim count suffers
 UndercoverToad: i think it's worth thinking about. but my beam has a feature that i don't know how to move to Chokudai and that I want to keep&#160;:(
 Scarfield: didnt know that was what chokudai search was, kewl
 Zenoscave: what's that feature?
 UndercoverToad: like smitsimax: not an official name
 UndercoverToad: Zenoscave :zipper_mouth:
 Zenoscave: so opponent sim?
 Zenoscave: Chokudai search is also a beam stack search no?
 UndercoverToad: yes, i think you can call it like that
 UndercoverToad: I use one for coders of the realm
 AntiSquid: i went straight for chokudai to try it out
 Chainman: hey
 Kamillo1204: hey
 Kamillo1204: how are you?
 Zenoscave: what time does silver oven today? In 2.5 hrs?
 UndercoverToad: more like 4.5h
 UndercoverToad: and hopefully (and most probably) no resubmit
 UndercoverToad: just moving up the higher ranks
 VizGhar: resubmit = new tournament?
 UndercoverToad: just sending every promoting bot in a forced submit
 cegprakash: does promotion happens automatically or is there a dude sitting out there presses the promote button?
 VizGhar: bleh.. hopefully not
 UndercoverToad: SaiksyApo is opening the leagues manually
 UndercoverToad: and choosing the boss
 Zenoscave: what range do we epect to make it through 500?
 VizGhar: they most probably only pick one player and sets his code as next league boss
 Zenoscave: maybe a bit more?
 UndercoverToad: 500-800 sounds reasonable to me
 VizGhar: nobody knows... speculations
 AntiSquid: it's bronze expect high numbers imo
 Zenoscave: Also I finally got my beam search to work better than heuristic
 UndercoverToad: they do a quick code review
 UndercoverToad: to make sure there is no kill switch or other funny things
 AntiSquid: it's never too far from 50% in bronze
 UndercoverToad: once I became boss because I had like 500 lines and their first choice had 1500 lines to review
 cegprakash: it's weird my if else bot is 500 and eval bot at 760 :D
 cegprakash: both doing same things
 Zenoscave: I'd expect closer to 25% due to easy woods
 VizGhar: its still more then 1000players
 VizGhar: bot those wood bosses were really stupid
 Zenoscave: how many are in bronze now? I haven't looked in a moment
 Zenoscave: 3000?
 UndercoverToad: not even sure how much they stick to the percentages or go by absolute numbers
 AntiSquid: afaik they have a rule of thumb of sorts: bronze 50%, silver 25%, gold top 10 - 20 :P
 UndercoverToad: 5k in bronze
 struct: nice they will never chose me has boss
 Zenoscave: wat
 struct: I have 3k lines :D
 UndercoverToad: 5116
 AntiSquid: 3k lines for what?
 UndercoverToad: and 519 lines for my bot
 AntiSquid: i am barely at 500 .
 AntiSquid: comments included
 Zenoscave: 620 here. ButI have two searches
 struct: Stuff I used when beta testing
 Zenoscave: 550 now
 UndercoverToad: i'm slow at typing, so i have to be more precise
 struct: you have 520 lines?
 struct: how 
 struct: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 Scarfield: they are very long lines :thinking:
 AntiSquid: DRY code&#160;? :P
 VizGhar: I'm at 900loc, but too much copy paste and no bitwise operations
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: can we not update our bots once silver opens????
 Zenoscave: You can update bots til the end NotSureWhyThisWorks
 VizGhar: what? sure you can NotSureWhyThisWorks
 Schneewittchen: Of cause you can
 Scarfield: yes of course, you can update untill contest ends
 struct: my GameState struct has more line than that
 struct: lol
 Scarfield: xD
 Zenoscave: Even like 2 seconds before
 Zenoscave: just dont. Legend will be pissed
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh nvm I think I misunderstood a message earlier
 DomiKo: My debug have like 300 lines :nerd:
 dbdr: you can
 Zenoscave: nice bot dbdr
 dbdr: thanks
 UndercoverToad: i don't like your bot
 UndercoverToad: the fact that it's above me is the issue with it
 dbdr: now everything I try makes it worse&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: usually I reach that point around Friday
 Zenoscave: well keep trying for euler's sake
 Codechaos: 308 :X
 Zenoscave: lines of java!?
 Zenoscave: that's amazing
 Zenoscave: Ah dang I forgot to sleep again
 struct: 308 lineS?
 Codechaos: I don't do too complicated stuff. I don't compute shadows just make sure to have some space between trees
 struct: my brutaltester referee is bigger than that&#160;:(
 VizGhar: BTW, what is that brutaltester?
 struct: you want the referee?
 Zenoscave: sure
 struct: or you want to know whats brutaltester?
 VizGhar: for now I only want to know what is brutaltester
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 IvesL: can anyone please tell how is the score in clash of code calculated
 UndercoverToad: with Trueskill
 IvesL: like the exact score in leaderboard
 ddreams: is your brutaltester fork working, zeno?&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: mostly
 ddreams: nice of you to share
 Zenoscave: I can't get the sun.reflection warnings to go away
 ddreams: need to get java etc. installed on this laptop
 struct: VizGhar basicly is to test locally vs your own bots
 Codechaos: Will there be more rules in silver? What do you think they will be?
 VizGhar: I was about to ask, how does it know opponents bot
 UndercoverToad: bronze rules are final
 dbdr: Zenoscave did you try with java8?
 VizGhar: So I should simple use it to evaluate, whether my new bot is better then my old bot right struct?
 struct: I use it for that yeah
 struct: but sometimes beating your previous bot might not be enough
 Zenoscave: not yet dbdr
 struct: So I usually test vs N versions of my bots
 VizGhar: sure... makes sense especially if you are just tweaking final code
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: wow brutalTester looks really useful
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: anybody know of any useful resources on beam search?
 ddreams: this one is great: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem">https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem</a>
 ddreams: is there a recommended java version for brutaltester?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ngl I found the pseudocode in that example quite confusing
 struct: I also struggled on finding resources for it
 struct: Basicly its dfs with pruning
 struct: from current state expand all current states, if the number of expanded is greater than beam width then you keep N (beam width) best
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I'm mainly confused about how you select the final option but I guess if you aren't simulating the opponent you can just pick the best result
 struct: then expand those
 struct: and repeat
 struct: until Depth 
 ddreams: at every depth you remember the best one
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: right
 struct: not the best one
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: best n ones
 struct: Best N ( N being beam width)
 ddreams: ^ I responded to the final action question
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh right
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: seems simple enough
 ddreams: any resource for chokudai search?
 VizGhar: chokuwhat?
 ddreams: variable beam width beam search
 UndercoverToad: and fixed depth
 VizGhar: suddenly crocodiles... didn't expect to learn new words today
 VizGhar: btw if somebody wants legend achievement, just submit empty code in pascal/groovy :D
 VizGhar: (I wonder how many will actualy do it)
 StyllyMyle: wdym
 UndercoverToad: finish first in a language
 UndercoverToad: there's an achievement for this
 VizGhar: ^
 UndercoverToad: but I like my bot too much for such an actoin
 UndercoverToad: + I already have the achievement
 AntiSquid: ezpz
 Marchete: there isn't brutaltester Ref for the challenge, right?
 UndercoverToad:   check zeno's github
 UndercoverToad: listed in the forks of the official referee
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 Numby: If there's starter code to read the input, there might an easy way to do a decent bot. You could do something like look through the possible actions, filter them by type based on the day (i.e. never complete prior to day 16, never seed in first 4 days etc.)
 Numby: then pick a random action from the remaining ones
 UndercoverToad: i'm not convinced that this idea can help me
 VizGhar: bot examples are wrong i believe
 VizGhar: but rest is possible yes
 VizGhar: *both
 KalamariKing: y'all ever have low battery so you turn of your interwebs while coding, just to turn it back on and get bombarded with errors
 UndercoverToad: i have a desktop with direct power supply that can't get low
 Astrobytes: ^
 UndercoverToad: except for a total power outage :thinking:
 UndercoverToad: but hasn't happened yet. just internet connection dropping twice a day
 UndercoverToad: i have vodafone
 Schneewittchen: Internet wire here is made of wood apparently
 UndercoverToad: for me it's an old TV wire ("Kabel") which was never used as such
 UndercoverToad: it's fast (400 MBit/s) but really annoying when the connection suddenly drops during a phone call while working from home
 Zenoscave: I have maybe 200 Mb/s
 struct: euler you are liking the game so far?
 Zenoscave: And pay a really steep price for it
 Schneewittchen: Do you pay for 200 mbs or do you actually get 200? :D
 Zenoscave: both
 UndercoverToad: i still don't see the strategic depth even after playing for some days
 struct: I pay for 200 and get 200
 Zenoscave: I pay for 200 but it varies from 180-220 depending on traffic in the apartment complex
 Zenoscave: I recently upgraded for the contest
 Schneewittchen: Where do you guys live? Capital of norway? ^^
 Zenoscave: Denver, USA
 UndercoverToad: my main profile tells where I live
 struct: my upload is medicore though
 UndercoverToad: in case you already guess who I am
 Zenoscave: 5 Mbits on a good day&#160;;)
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/y3guy5d.png">https://i.imgur.com/y3guy5d.png</a>
 Schneewittchen: But you are undercover. This is too good :D
 UndercoverToad: chat got laggy on my main account :D
 Schneewittchen: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 tobk: Guess silver should open same time of day as contest started? (i.e. in one-and-a-half- hours or so)?
 eulerscheZahl: let me try again, maybe it got better now
 Schneewittchen: test 123
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/CYoycja">https://imgur.com/a/CYoycja</a>
 VizGhar: idk monday afternoon... probably good right?
 Schneewittchen: :sweat_smile:
 VizGhar: heh
 UndercoverToad: at least I could send a whole message this time
 UndercoverToad: silver will open in about 3.5h
 limakk: yay
 struct: should open now
 struct: before I get out of silver range
 UndercoverToad: and the game is frustrating me again. i'm of for a trip :bicycle:
 UndercoverToad: :bike:
 Astrobytes: Like an Albert Hofmann bicycle trip?
 UndercoverToad: no idea what that means
 Zenoscave: struct you're definitely in silver
 UndercoverToad: just driving through the forest. there is even shadow
 UndercoverToad: i'm definitely in gold already B)
 UndercoverToad: but not legend yet
 Zenoscave: UndercoverToad ssshhh
 DetoBot: :joy:
 struct: damn i also need to upgrade the motherboard&#160;:(
 struct: Damn sockets
 struct: I still have 1151
 Zenoscave: That's quite outdated no?
 struct: yes
 VizGhar: not legend UndercoverToad? U kidding right?
 Zenoscave: no legend *yet
 VizGhar: not legend yet? U kidding right?
 Zenoscave: There will be big improvements in bots before legend opens
 Zenoscave: I trust the euler judgement
 VizGhar: hmm how many players will get to legend when it opens? 50? more?
 Zenoscave: 10-20 usually I think
 solistice: maybe any tips here: I created my bot in multiple files, is there an easy plugin or something to squash it in 1 file?
 Zenoscave: what lang?
 Zenoscave: Probably not but what lang
 solistice: so I can keep my sanity while developing but also test it frequently here
 solistice: c#
 solistice: c#
 Zenoscave: ask illedan
 Zenoscave: he had a version at somepoint. I forked it but I haven't used it recently
 VizGhar: 10-20? isn't it too little? give me hope :D
 Zenoscave: On opening it's very slim
 struct: it opens with low but it increases fast
 struct: people will get pushed
 struct: I got pushed from 40th gold to legend
 AllYourTrees: are there rule additions in silver leagie?
 Zenoscave: nope
 AllYourTrees: cool
 JorgeBernal: Guys, where do you recommend starting if you want to learn to code a good bot 
 KiwiTae: JorgeBernal books
 VizGhar: then read post mortems and try to understand terms you don't know
 VizGhar: and ask anything here... MSmit s will answer even most basic question
 Gedzius: Does anyone know if there is a fixed amount of trees u start with&#160;?
 Illedan: solistice <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger</a>
 VizGhar: always 2 Gedzius
 Gedzius: nvm found it
 Gedzius: yes thank you
 Marchete: thanks Ille
 Marchete: btw how do I create a simple exe with dotnet?
 JorgeBernal: thanks ddream, that was my first step, I'm in bronze now
 Zenoscave: like a self contained exe Marchete?
 Marchete: yes
 JorgeBernal: KiwiTae is there any book that is good for turn-based AI? 
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: like old mono
 Illedan: dotnet publish?
 SirLoxley: How come I gained 70 ranks without submitting a thing since yesterday?
 Marchete: but it creates a lot of stuff
 Marchete: need a json and such
 Zenoscave: dotnet publish --configuration Release --self-contained --runtime linux-x64
 Zenoscave: or windows-x64
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 VizGhar: SirLoxley consider yourself lucky
 VizGhar: your bot is playing games even when you sleep
 Zenoscave: I add the output flag (-o) to a bin folder because it still makes a few dll's
 Marchete: that's what I say, it's not only a single file
 SirLoxley: I do, I mean usually I submit it kind of works, I end up somewhere and next day my bot is down 400 ranks. It's just weird. I like it weird
 solistice: thx Illedan
 solistice: created my own python script to do the same
 solistice: does the trick
 Zenoscave: should be a lot less on windows Marchete
 Marchete: wth 190 files on publish folder...
 Zenoscave: yeah... It gets bad
 Zenoscave: but that's as close to a mono .exe as you can
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: was at rank 40 a few hours earlier now at 90. Everyone is grinding
 Zenoscave: you can use csc but it takes some scripting to make it runable
 Marchete: I just want a single bytecode .exe
 Marchete: not directly selfcontained
 Marchete: just like old mono compiler
 Marchete: I guess dll + json then
 ZarthaxX: hey
 Zenoscave: Not sure that's possible in .NET Core
 Zenoscave: Maybe with 5.0??
 Zenoscave: hi zarthie
 Marchete: dll + json project is doable
 cegprakash: is it worthy to sneak a tree on opponents mouth when he's asleep?
 ZarthaxX: howdy pewpew
 Hoyer: when does silver open?
 Zenoscave: try dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained -c Release -o &lt;path&gt;
 Zenoscave: I was missing the -p:PublishSingleFile=true before
 ZarthaxX: maybe in 2 hours
 Zenoscave: should be 2 files per project
 Zenoscave: exe and pdb
 Marchete: lol 75MB
 Marchete: thx
 Zenoscave: yw
 Zenoscave: -pPublishTrimmed=true
 Zenoscave: -p: **
 Zenoscave: should cut it by 3x
 Zenoscave: depending on your dll usage
 Marchete: it worked, thx Zenoscave and Illedan
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Marchete: now I can join CS files fast
 Marchete: it just fails on the #define preprocessor, that must go first
 Zenoscave: I think my fork of ille's preprocessor handles that.
 Zenoscave: don't remember
 martinpapa69: has the elo score of top player ever been this high? 
 ZarthaxX: good question haha
 Zenoscave: once in CSB
 Zenoscave: Pen
 struct: I dont know what mine was on the start of the contest
 struct: With 100% win rate
 elderlybeginner: what's the schedule for contest's silver, gold and legend league to be opened?
 martinpapa69: usually the top ten is like 40-45 or something in big leagues
 ZarthaxX: struct did you take a screenshot of top1&#160;????
 Zenoscave: if  not too late now
 struct: yes
 Zenoscave: damn.
 struct: I made it at 10 hours mark
 ZarthaxX: check it then? :P
 struct: 12*
 struct: wasnt 100% at that time
 ZarthaxX: oh so not many players yet
 ZarthaxX: ah...&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: should have taken more hehe
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/bcUw8hg.png">https://i.imgur.com/bcUw8hg.png</a>
 Zenoscave: I'm in that photo
 Zenoscave: at 9
 Marchete: ZarthaxX you need to improve the bot a bit
 Zenoscave: not even top 1000
 Zenoscave: c'mon zarthie
 ZarthaxX: a bit?
 ZarthaxX: i havent been home for a day and have been working on smth for uni too
 ZarthaxX: not easy
 ZarthaxX: i will try tho, for you guys
 Mohamed_Ali: hi all
 Marchete:&#160;:*
 ZarthaxX: hey
 Fiddle: guys i am brand new to this is there anything i can do to teach me 
 Fiddle: i am struggling ahahahah
 cegprakash: I wonder if ppl have already started to react to opponents
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: just try coding some simple strategies at the game and work from there
 VizGhar: Fiddle just do the quest map
 Mohamed_Ali: how can i send a private msg to someone i follow?
 Fiddle: what language do you recomend 
 struct: c++
 JorgeBernal: Guys should I try to do a mini-max alpha-beta pruning algorithm or should I learn another better (most modern) way of doing it 
 VizGhar: cegprakash sure... at least I'm looking at opponent while seeding as well as his shadows
 cegprakash: Mohamed_Ali they have to follow u too
 Fiddle: ok thanks
 cegprakash: VizGhar impressive 
 cegprakash: top 100 just by looking at these?
 VizGhar: JorgeBernal whatever works for you... but the minimax can be used only in endgame (you probably won't be able to evaluate more then 3 depth)
 VizGhar: hmm yes... but try to recommend me what else should i look for&#160;:)
 VizGhar: I'll get to top 50 tomorrow... now I'm rewriting my code. It was pure mess and I'm inexperienced in this
 ZarthaxX: struct hitting lvl 30 today? :O
 JorgeBernal: That's a good point. So, how are people on top 50 programming the bots, just hardcoding the posibiilties?
 struct: I hope so
 struct: I already got experience from silver
 struct: I dont know if I get it again
 ZarthaxX: nice
 ZarthaxX: D:
 VizGhar: oh for sure not JorgeBernal... You can hardcode early and endgame... you don;t know what can possibly happen in the middle
 VizGhar: You have to be good whether you are playing against week or against strong players
 VizGhar: its impossible to dardcode
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar if else or beam?
 VizGhar: hardcoded 5 moves + beam + hardcoded last 2-3 moves
 ZarthaxX: first 5 and last 2-3? :P
 ZarthaxX: of the game you mean
 Mohamed_Ali: hi guys i need help with C# code
 VizGhar: yes
 ZarthaxX: nicely done
 ZarthaxX: gz!
 Mohamed_Ali: could someone help?
 Gedzius: Does anyone know if the map doesn't change at all in bronze league, cells will have same richnes every time etc.?
 VizGhar: no... you havent asked Mohamed_Ali
 JorgeBernal: VizGhar what is this beam thing? How could i learn more about it? 
 VizGhar: uff... hard stuf... can you guys give him some paper to read?
 VizGhar: I don't know what to recommend
 VizGhar: Simply throw away non-promissing nodes in your search on every depth
 Mohamed_Ali: lol why?
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 Scarfield: just ask your question Mohamed_Ali (be specific) dont ask to ask&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: JorgeBernal do you know bfs
 Mohamed_Ali: thx
 Gedzius: Does anyone know if the map doesn't change at all in bronze league, cells will have the same richness every time etc.?
 RoboStac: the richness 0 cells change
 Gedzius: but the other ones don't&#160;?
 Ajaiy2: The positions and richness 0 cells change
 RoboStac: but the basic layout without any richness 0 is fixed
 Gedzius: ok thank you
 Mohamed_Ali: @scarfeild
 Fiddle: i have never done any code before and i fell this is a bit hard is this for more advanced coders bc i am so confused lol
 Ajaiy2: No, I came up with a simple one. Not much, but it works.
 JorgeBernal: ZarthaxX I didn't but I know now 
 Fiddle: i am so confused ahaha

 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Fiddle I would recommend learning python or javascript with some basic puzzles on this website. If you want to make a bot for the spring contest I suggest trying to implement simple strategies instead of complex algorithms
 VizGhar: Gedzius see that pastebin ^^
 Fiddle: ok thank you 
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: np
 Fiddle: will those walk me through it bc i get so confused 
 Gedzius: VizGhar if we dumb it down the cells don't change i suppose
 Gedzius: because i cant read code im quite a beginner
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Fiddle If you learn the basic syntax and basic programming concepts you can practice them on the puzzles on this website
 Fiddle: ok sounds good:thumbsup:
 Ajaiy2: How do you all manage your code at bronze? Im really struggling to find any errors
 VizGhar: Ajaiy2 use external IDE and debug there
 Ajaiy2: I don't mean it that way
 Ajaiy2: My code's all getting large
 limakk: u can
 VizGhar: aaah... well you have to clean the mess up
 limakk: can't do bronze with 10 lines :p
 VizGhar: I'm doing it today&#160;:)
 Ajaiy2: How is that even possible
 limakk: perl
 Ajaiy2: Ah
 limakk: pearl&#160;: p
 AllGoodNamesRGone: If I make the worse bot than the current one and I test it in arena, will my rank go down or they keep my best bot
 RoboStac: go down - only your last 'test in arena' counts
 SirLoxley: last submission will be counted. Having said that you can resurrect your previous version via "history"
 Ajaiy2: I cant even imagine the look at the faces of people who failed at the last battle
 VizGhar: better to don't touch your code last day right? :D
 RoboStac: nah, panicing 30 seconds before the end and making wild changes to try and win is the best way to play
 Ajaiy2: Yeah, it'd just let you down at the last seecond
 apro2929: I'd say possible_actions[rand(seed=69)]is the best algorithm for any adversarial bot 
 VizGhar: wut?
 BlitzProg: So, minimax, beamsearch, montecarlo? feels like anything could be used for improvement
 Ajaiy2: No, none of those complicated thingies are for me
 AntiSquid: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 AntiSquid: this is getting annoying
 cegprakash: I like my current submission bot even though it can't get points&#160;:) at the end of the game I have map control and I am able to harvest all trees with 100 sun points left&#160;:)
 Ajaiy2: Whoa 33 free points
 cegprakash: yup
 VizGhar: having too much sun isn't good imho
 VizGhar: how much points have you actually have in summary?
 Marchete: I'm so slow....

 gmessier: Someone know when silver will open today? I can't found any calendar like in the fall contest.
 UndercoverToad: in 2h
 gmessier: :thumbsup:
 UndercoverToad: source: experience from previous contests
 UndercoverToad: i remember your profile pic from long ago. you have played hypersonic, haven't you?
 gmessier: Yeah... like 4 years ago :D
 gmessier: my first... and only... contest I finish in legend :P
 ill-be-waiting-outside: 105
 UndercoverToad: maybe that's why I remember you
 UndercoverToad: finished 54th back then. HyperSonic was my first contest
 gmessier: (I just realize that you are eulerscheZahl ...)
 jrke: nope he is not over best toad
 Ajaiy2: Im actually kinda creeped out by my AI
 UndercoverToad: sorry for confusing, chat gets extremely laggy for moderators&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: we can see all 1000 or so users that are online right now
 springchallenge: When the silver league will open guys&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: in 1.5h
 AntiSquid: are we there yet&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: we should really teach a chatbot to answer that
 jrke: UndercoverToad  whats the source of data in 1.5h?
 MSmits: it's almost always 18:00
 UndercoverToad: i would kick you if i could
 VizGhar: Automaton2000 when will silver league open?
 Automaton2000: how many lines of code and it was like that in the chat
 springchallenge: :joy:
 limakk: trust me bro is the source
 AntiSquid: it's usually at 17:00 jrke (my time)
 jrke: ohkay
 UndercoverToad: 21:30 jrke time
 VizGhar: Switching to bitwise operations is simply perfect... I'll have to start with them right away next time
 gmessier: It can be at any hour if you can move fast enough :D
 VizGhar: uhm... thats why japanese guys are always ahead
 jrke: what would the opening window for silver? what all do you think 
 UndercoverToad: because they are so tiny they can fit themself into the bitboard?
 jrke: i think 1200 cause it was 750 last contest
 UndercoverToad: then why should it more more this time√ü
 UndercoverToad: about the same number of players
 AntiSquid: sun shine, timeout and bugs, what's there not to like about this contest?
 UndercoverToad: i think i still have a buggy move gen
 gmessier: It depends on the boss.
 Ajaiy2: My AI automatically plants a seed if it cannot do it at the distance I programmed it to. Did my AI just grow a brain or something?
 KaizenGTD: what time is openning Silver?
 cegprakash: AntiSquid haha
 VizGhar: It'll be something like fu guys here have a 5x5x5 board
 VizGhar: KaizenGTD look last 20-30 messages
 cegprakash: Ajaiy2 ur code is controlling u
 cegprakash: human era is over
 jrke: i tried very hard to make a sim that works but its not working i mean referee looks bug free and i got puzzled whats the problem&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: oh, move gen is even doing what it's supposed to do. i just don't understand anymore how it works
 cegprakash: jrke write a sim without looking at referee
 cegprakash: and refer it after reaching gold that way just by fixing ur referee u reach legend
 Marchete: jrke don't write a sim and just look the referee
 Marchete: it's bitboard sim?
 jrke: i am talking about referee that i made in my code(my own coded rule based referee)
 jrke: nope no bitboards yet
 Marchete: ahh
 Hoyer: generating seed actions seems so expensive.. 
 UndercoverToad: it is
 Marchete: and if you eval the board a bit more complex...
 MSmits: mmh whats expensive about it?
 Marchete: I still don't know how to do it
 MSmits: there's just many seed actions
 UndercoverToad: takes a lookout to get from tree mask to target mask
 MSmits: but if you evaluate it per seed action, it's not expensive
 UndercoverToad: and an extra bit operation to get the lookup index
 Marchete: if I evaluate the whole board, each cell taking into account neighbours and sun
 Marchete: it's expensive...
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad __builtin_ffsll&#160;?
 Queuebee: does anyone have guides on how to approach converting the gamestate to bitboards and creating some kind of cheap delta tuples instead of "COMPLETE 32"
 UndercoverToad: no, I use C#
 ZarthaxX: but the wequivalent haha
 MSmits: yeah, but tbh, this sort of performance issue is not what makes or breaks your game
 ZarthaxX: still doing mc toad?
 UndercoverToad: i can't even read those C++ function names
 UndercoverToad: beam
 UndercoverToad: scotty
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: scotty?
 UndercoverToad: beam me up scotty?
 ZarthaxX: i dont know that :rofl:
 reCurse: MSmits should make a stream about bitboards, would be a nice followup to bitstreams
 ZarthaxX: :O the god
 MSmits: reCurse i promised to share my bitboard and sim after contest
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad still solo beam?
 Queuebee: what's a bitstream :frowning:
 MSmits: not gonna do stream, but i'll write something up
 reCurse: Arcane knowledge for stupid people, Queuebee
 UndercoverToad: solo beam?
 ZarthaxX: only yourself
 UndercoverToad: no opponent
 ZarthaxX: right
 Astrobytes: You haven't lived if you don't know the Bitstreams Queuebee
 ZarthaxX: gz on your rank btw&#160;:)
 MSmits: I figured out why my bot is crap btw
 ZarthaxX: what is that scotty thing
 Astrobytes: Star Trek
 Queuebee: that's what I thought Astrobytes 
 ZarthaxX: mhmm
 Astrobytes: "Beam me up Scotty"
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tenor.com/view/beam-me-up-scotty-gif-11313969">https://tenor.com/view/beam-me-up-scotty-gif-11313969</a>
 MSmits: my trees are shading themselves because the beam doesnt look far enough ahead to know that seeding next to existing trees is bad
 ZarthaxX: MSmits what happened
 AntiSquid: recurz here, but no odd level 3 alt at the top&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: oh&#160;:(
 MSmits: should be easily fixed though
 reCurse: I'm only here for the crap talk
 MSmits: i can just prune seed locations better
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad lol never saw startrek
 AntiSquid: ah, door's always open for that
 UndercoverToad: me neither. i just know the quote
 MSmits: reCurse not participating?
 ZarthaxX: ah ok haha
 UndercoverToad: crap talk is fine, welcome backj
 reCurse: Life is boring without banter
 reCurse: And covid sucks
 Nerchio: MSmits my bot was also seeding next to other trees so i just forbid it to seed in range 1 of my other trees
 Nerchio: i know its not ideal but hey
 MSmits: Nerchio it's a good idea, but maybe allow it if there is no other option
 MSmits: and shadows go further than 1 hex
 Majeck: When does the silver league open?
 Nerchio: yeah i know i tried many things and simple worked best so far
 MSmits: yeah it's definitely better than nothing
 UndercoverToad: wait until the next user asks that Majeck (can't take more than 5min)
 MSmits: my bot happily makes rows of trees
 UndercoverToad: i'm answering it over and over again :P
 euijoong.lee: How long do I have to stay above boss to promote to next league?
 MSmits: it thinks: Imma make a wall, tree shalt not pass!
 Marchete: do you have covid reCurse?
 reCurse: No no
 Marchete: ahhh
 Marchete: :sweat_smile:
 euijoong.lee: How do I go up a league?
 UndercoverToad: he has lockdown
 Donald_D._Doge: hi bruh's when is slivre opanning&#160;?
 reCurse: Just bored out of my mind stuck home most of the time
 Marchete: good good
 reCurse: Getting vaccine in 2 weeks finally
 Marchete: anyways take care man
 UndercoverToad: oh, cangrats
 UndercoverToad: i don't have an appointment yet
 reCurse: Yeah I heard Germany is behind&#160;:/
 MSmits: your southern neighbours should send you theirs reCurse, since they are too stupid to want it
 MSmits: i will probably be waiting a few months also
 MSmits: think we are behind on Germany 
 Astrobytes: No date for mine either
 MSmits: which is weird, GB started early
 kovi: hungary ftw
 Majeck: My third world country has over 50% of people vaccinated
 Majeck: And it's voluntary
 Astrobytes: Prioritising particular demographics first MSmits
 AntiSquid: australia ftw 
 MSmits: yeah here too, but in the US everyone can get it now
 MSmits: and they started later than GB
 reCurse: I'm not even a social butterfly but I'm just dying to see some friends right now eh
 Majeck: Their vaccinating 35-40 year olds as of this week
 Majeck: *They're
 MSmits: ah then i would be getting it this week if i lived in your 3rd world country&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: reCurse: Yeah, it's only when the option is taken away that it really gets to you
 MSmits: I am pretty antisocial, but even I would not mind seeing some friends
 AntiSquid: geez ... calling people'
 AntiSquid: s country 3rd world @_@
 Majeck: MSmits yeah lol, for all of it's faults at least they were smart with vaccines and lockdowns
 MSmits: AntiSquid he said this himself :P
 Majeck: AntiSquid I described it as third world XD
 AntiSquid: oof ok
 MSmits: i do now realize what it looks like if you're missing that part of the chat
 MSmits: thanks for fixing that AntiSquid :P
 reCurse: #cancelsmits
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: i was just thinking, damn why is smitz so elitist today?
 Majeck: Unrelated note, most people know what third world and first world countries are
 Majeck: Y'all know who the second world countries are?
 Majeck: It's a term from the Cold War
 FatIvan: Those aligned with USSR in the cold war?
 MSmits: arent they south america?
 MSmits: mostly?
 Majeck: FatIvan has it right hahaha
 MSmits: ohh ok
 AntiSquid: by 2nd ww terms? majeck i don't think it's an accurate guideline really
 MSmits: no i meant historically
 FatIvan: They are outdated terms really.
 MSmits: south america was somewhere between in development back then
 MSmits: yeah pretty inaccurate
 Majeck: As a South American I'd say we're still an underdeveloped continent 
 MSmits: it's all relative anyway
 Majeck: I mean Chile and Uruguay lead in GDP per capita, and it's less than $20k 
 MSmits: thats not bad 
 Majeck: Meanwhile US has $60k per capita, and western Europe averages like $40k if I'm not wrong
 MSmits: averages might not be the best way to measure
 Majeck: MSmits yeah, but inequality is also pretty high (Though it's been going down)
 MSmits: if you take the median, US does a lot worse
 Majeck: MSmits relative to the US sure, not relative to South America
 Majeck: I think median in US is like $35K
 MSmits: just saying you  are adding multi-billionairs into that 60k
 Majeck: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States</a>
 Majeck: $36K is the median income in the US according to wikipedia
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: sounds right
 polill00: seems low
 polill00: are they counting unemployed?
 MSmits: a lot of poverty in the US
 MSmits: of course they are
 Majeck: Eh, prices are pretty low in the US, compared to the rest of the world
 reCurse: Had no idea it was that low, was expecting higher
 MSmits: might have been higher relative to the rest of the world 20 yrs ago
 MSmits: country's been going to crap
 polill00: They counting children?
 Zenoscave: I know Researchers in Labratories who make $15/hr
 Majeck: But yeah, inequality in the US is pretty ridiculous according to what the average person thinks
 MSmits: yeah polill00
 Zenoscave: (31-32K year)
 Majeck: Top 1% holds 1/4 of the wealth IIRC
 Zenoscave: If you aren't in a big business with a white collar job or working at the same job for long enough to max out raises, you're not making much
 Majeck: This video is pretty cool at visualizing it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM</a>
 AntiSquid: cost of living is most important for average citizen Joe
 Majeck: Nevermind the top 1% of the USA holds 40% of the wealth of the country
 polill00: about 25% of people are under 18. I could see this combined with the 16% of the people over 65 including unemployed to make the median as low as it is.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp">https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp</a>
 Majeck: polill00 usually those stats count working age people
 reCurse: You'd think they'd only include employable people in the median calculation no?
 MSmits: there's also a big difference between wealth inequality and income inequality
 MSmits: people confuse the two
 MSmits: my country has an enormous amount of wealth inequality
 MSmits: but income inequality is not bad
 AntiSquid: are people with disabilities / retired also included&#160;?
 Majeck: MSmits what's the practical difference? Like in day to day
 MSmits: income is what you make, wealth is what you own
 polill00: I was told it included children and unemplayed.
 MSmits: if you spend everything you make and own nothing...
 polill00: employed*
 reCurse: That would undermine the metric I'd think
 polill00: Thats what I thought
 MSmits: people who rent their house, own almost nothing
 MSmits: but they could be renting a hugely expensive house, live a very wealthy livestyle
 MSmits: lifestyle
 MSmits: because they are high income
 MSmits: so in a country where a small percentage of people own all real estate, the wealth inequality is enormous
 MSmits: but income inequality might be small
 Majeck: Yeah, but wouldn't income inequality equate to wealth inequality in the long term?
 MSmits: not necessarily
 Majeck: Oh, chat updated on my end
 reCurse: x towards infinity
 MSmits: these are complicated systems
 Westicles: I was talking to one of the homeless beggars who stands out by the streetlight.  I told him about a job opening and he laughed at me. He said he averages a dollar a minute in handouts.  
 Majeck: Westicles yeah, asking for money on the street is pretty profitable
 MSmits: averages several times a year getting beat up and robbed :P
 reCurse: Press X for doubt
 AntiSquid: y
 polill00: depending on where they live.
 MSmits: often people living on the street are addicted to something. At least here
 MSmits: giving them money is probably not a good idea
 Majeck: Just getting a dolar every 5 minutes and "working" for 8 hours equates to  $100 a day, $2000 a month and $24k yearly
 AntiSquid: same in UK MSmits
 Majeck: When I went to LA I was impressed by the amount of homeless there were
 Majeck: And a lot of them were completely out of their minds, like screaming in the middle of the street 
 Majeck: One ran into a shop I was in while shirtless, spewing some random stuff about the govt
 MSmits: the problem is that people with heavy psychological problems and addicted cant be forcibly helped
 MSmits: even though there are systems
 Marchete: they were coding bitboards, that's why they scream
 AntiSquid: true contest veterans
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: give them some popcounts plz
 Majeck: Yeah, it's easier to get access to "hard" drugs in richer countries
 Westicles: The homeless here just want to smoke weed and surf all day
 MSmits: some of them are made here =/
 Majeck: At least where I live the most popular illegal drug is marihuana and maybe sometimes cocaine
 AntiSquid: mine is driving me insane Marchete, high count and poor results @_@
 MSmits: I think they make loads meth and xtc here
 MSmits: export goods..
 Majeck: Yeah, and that's a lot more addictive and problematic
 Majeck: So more "helpless" people on the street
 reCurse: Yeah crypto is the worst addiction
 MSmits: oohh fake money
 MSmits: i'll just buy a monopoly set and play with that&#160;:)
 Majeck: Probably will end up losing less money in the long term
 Zenoscave: I hate hearing the term blockchain anymore
 Ajaiy2: Im on 1371, feeling good
 Zenoscave: it's so far removed frmo it
 Majeck: $20 up front rather than $3k in a few weeks lol
 Marchete: well, just like any fiduciary currency
 Zenoscave: from it's actual meaning
 MSmits: it's really a bad thing, especially because it's mined. All that calculation time that could have been used to solve Yavalath
 Zenoscave: lol
 Marchete: lol
 Zenoscave: MSmits what's the best opening
 Zenoscave: 3 3?
 reCurse: Should make a cryptocurrency to solve it
 MSmits: 3 3 and 4 4 are both solved as win for player 1, so doesnt matter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So I've got 5 minutes...u can open silver now
 dbdr: MSmits. create YavalathCoin!
 MSmits:  4 4 is easier to solve so i guess that one
 Majeck: Hey Zeno, would you be interested in investing in my company? We sell apples &amp; oranges but I think blockchain will play a really big role in our distribution
 reCurse: Maybe derive some proof out of yavalath games
 reCurse: *proof of work
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: good ideas!
 Zenoscave: SnakeCoin 
 Marchete: sell papers, 40bucks each
 reCurse: Get rich and solve yavalath what's not to like
 Marchete: hey there are ppl that buys them :D
 MSmits: lol...
 MSmits: one time!
 Zenoscave: I can't say much though I bought a dollar for 5 dollars once as a teenager. It was in a novelty shop and had a sticker on it
 Majeck: In monopoly I used to trick my sister into giving me 1 $20 bill for 5 $1 bills
 MSmits: ah yes, well some people become smart later in life
 KalamariKing: why tho
 MSmits: it;s fine Zenoscave
 Majeck: More bills = More money
 Zenoscave: I still have yet to become smart
 MSmits: you rank 3 times higher in the tree game :P
 Majeck: Well, I have to go to class, when does silver open anyway?
 Zenoscave: 3x higher than you?
 Zenoscave: 1h
 Majeck: :smiling_imp:
 MSmits: ye
 Zenoscave: Majeck
 Majeck: Thanks!
 AntiSquid: MSmitz what are you doing so low anyway? where's the bitmagic gone?
 MSmits: I'll start working on it again after promote. 
 MSmits: bit magic is fine, i am just not playing the game right
 MSmits: heuristics and such
 AntiSquid: you added no heuristics&#160;?
 MSmits: I even have an extensive sim check, if you play a game vs me, you see me test sim
 MSmits: (with messages)
 MSmits: i added some
 MSmits: but not the most important ones
 MSmits: like dont seed trees next to eachother :P
 MSmits: seeding a tree next to another tree is like seeding 2/3 of a tree
 reCurse: As far as I'm concerned, cut down all the trees
 reCurse: Stupid allergies...
 MSmits: because 1/6 of days 1 tree shades the other and another 1/6th the shading is reversed
 MSmits: so you get 2/3 income
 Zenoscave: I have yet to get my eval to space right
 MSmits: of that new tree
 Zenoscave: that's today's task
 MSmits: yeah me too
 Majeck: MSmits I'm stealing that 2/3 number
 MSmits: it's ok, i didnt invent it
 MSmits: but you can call it the smits-fraction if you want
 Zenoscave: fractionmits
 MSmits: i'll happily take credit for 2/3
 The_ZimaBlue: isnt silver league supposed to be launched todat
 reCurse: Just rumors
 Zenoscave: in about 1 hour
 Marchete: do you use zobrist MSmits?
 MSmits: nah, no need, i am just hashing the states
 MSmits: similar
 Marchete: hashing without zobrist?
 MSmits: yeah i just use unordered set, because it's convenient. 
 Zenoscave: zobrist is overkill here I think
 MSmits: its slow as hell probably
 MSmits: but speed is no issue
 Queuebee: you? represent the whole gamestate in one unordered set?
 reCurse: Yes.
 Queuebee: :jaw_drops:
 Marchete: well, maybe just the hash
 Marchete: not the whole gamestate
 reCurse: It's usually called python though
 Queuebee: but it's in C++ 
 Zenoscave: lol recurse 
 Marchete: zobrist is overkill because I basically 2x all my bit operations
 MSmits: no lol, i have an array of states, but i also put them in an unordered set
 MSmits: then i clear it on the new level
 Marchete: but any other hashing will imply a full rehash on any change
 Queuebee: OH 
 solistice: is there a(n easy) way to get the initial data input?
 UndercoverToad: as we are on it: what do you think about my hashing Marchete?
 UndercoverToad: foreach (long level in LevelTrees) hash ^= level.GetHashCode();
 MSmits: thats what i do UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: now that I look at it i already see a problem with it
 Marchete: wth is that
 MSmits: except it's xorshift instead of GetHashCode
 UndercoverToad: asking about performance here
 reCurse: I hear a disturbance in the bits
 reCurse: As if they were all hashed into nothing
 Marchete: if gethashcode is uint64_t
 Marchete: then it's sh*t
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damnit, i have to put pants on and do some work
 Marchete: you are just combining all tree uint64_t
 AntiSquid: is wearing pants that big of a nuissance&#160;?
 Marchete: no?
 UndercoverToad: hash is an int, using a built-in hashing function
 Marchete: I've had bad experience with these
 reCurse: Willing to bet your collision rate is off the charts
 Marchete: just make sure the same data throws the same hash always
 UndercoverToad: hm, let me check
 Marchete: I remember using it on some tests
 MSmits: well... with unordered set you have a hashcomparer
 miszu: good morning children
 dbdr: stochastic hashing :D
 Marchete: and oh boy it was a disaster
 UndercoverToad: 74 collisions in 7k nodes
 MSmits: thats fine
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: yeah
 reCurse: Ew
 Marchete: hahaha
 Marchete: only 1% collision rate
 Marchete: *only*
 MSmits: it's fine if you're lazy and are not trying to squeeze every last&#160;% out of it
 reCurse: Only?!
 Ziink: "only" xD
 Marchete: I forgot the /s sorry
 UndercoverToad: oh wait i was counting wrong
 Zenoscave: %1 is fine. if you're talking about milk
 Ajaiy2: I reached top 1500 after a lot of edits on code
 reCurse: No it's all about 2%
 Zenoscave: I only drink 12%
 UndercoverToad: counting the really equal ones, not the false positives
 Zenoscave: (yogurt)
 AllGoodNamesRGone: how to check timeout to break the search before it reach the deepest
 Marchete: do you override GetHashCode UndercoverToad?
 DetoBot: So, this game could have included 4 players, great 
 Marchete: if not, deep copy a Level Tree and check hashes
 UndercoverToad: oh, calling equals &gt; 10k times with only 74 really equal results :o
 Marchete: if different, throw that thing away
 AntiSquid: as if it's not chatoic enough DetoBot
 AntiSquid: was expecting 4 players though
 UndercoverToad: the hashset uses the hashcode before equals so I see the problem :scream:
 reCurse: Take distinct states only and measure when they yield the same hash
 KalamariKing: Could someone look over my code and see what's going wrong
 UndercoverToad: the like i quotes was part of me overwriting GetHashcode
 Marchete: but I mean
 Marchete: if you have the same data on an object
 Marchete: you should get the same hash for both
 Marchete: that's the first step
 KalamariKing: This is my first search func and while it's only going one layer deep, I wanna make sure it works
 AntiSquid: days or moves KalamariKing&#160;?
 dbdr: AntiSquid it's not really chaotic compared to other games. top players can play ~50 games before losing a single one
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid days
 KalamariKing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/356b9e8f-833b-4250-b684-c881aba7bd85">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/356b9e8f-833b-4250-b684-c881aba7bd85</a>
 KalamariKing: I've looked at this code all weekend and I need a fresh pair of eyes
 reCurse: You can go to Tor for that
 Counterbalance: KalamariKing make sure you only print 1 action per turn
 UndercoverToad: 54912 collisions at a set of 7105 boards (comparing each with each except itself)
 Marchete: just perfection
 dbdr: :D
 Marchete: naaah
 reCurse: LOL
 Marchete: are you sure?
 ZarthaxX: F
 azriel1rf: I'm 26th now. But I don't use any searching algorithm such as beam search or monte carlo.
 reCurse: Yeah that's more in line with what I expected
 reCurse: Maybe slightly worse
 Marchete: so what do you do azriel1rf?
 Marchete: top 30th is a great achievement
 UndercoverToad: hm, down to 432 collisions if I change it a tiny bit
 azriel1rf: evaluate board
 Zenoscave: that's amazing azriel1rf
 azriel1rf: thanks!!
 Marchete: your evaluation is powerful
 azriel1rf: evaluate all the possible board next move
 Marchete: I've corrupted C# .net, not it's as ugly as C++
 Marchete: with all these fieldoffsets, unsafe, fixed, pointers
 Zenoscave: Marchete why
 reCurse: That's very insensitive to C++
 Marchete: now*
 solaimanope: how are you evaluating? which states are better?
 reCurse: I'm offended on its behalf
 Marchete: #define offended proud
 Marchete: thanks reCurse!
 Zenoscave: lol
 reCurse: Only works when you define before
 reCurse: gg
 Zenoscave: tac
 Zenoscave: gg
 7amasa: when is silver opening?
 Zenoscave: when it feels like it
 reCurse: Soon
 AntiSquid: dbdr i don't see how that relates, this is bronze, you surely lose more vs higher bots
 reCurse: For this contest wood league should be legend
 Queuebee: there's higher bots? ._.
 dbdr: in chaotic games you can more easily lose to weaker opponents
 Queuebee: ah that clarifies
 cegprakash: chaos is a ladder
 Wontonimo: yeah, i really like that about this game, i consistently win in the first couple dozen games
 Ashbury: Good evening. I keep getting 407 even though I haven't launch games in IDE since more than 30 minutes. Is it normal?
 reCurse: Yes
 Wontonimo: multiple runs with the same bot don't give wildly different results (for me).  I don't know about the top 20 anymore though.   It's been a few days since I was there
 UndercoverToad: there are different time limits and play limits
 UndercoverToad: the longest limit can lock you out for 24h
 reCurse: CG hates ways to be competitive
 reCurse: So they limited number of plays
 reCurse:  /half-s
 UndercoverToad: they even limited the numbers further for this contest
 Marchete: be competitive, but not that much
 kovi: wontomino...maybe you loose that capability soon
 Ashbury: I guess it might be because of crypto miners x)
 Ashbury: But this is a serious handicap actually.
 kovi: (or not...if you stay in bronze)
 UndercoverToad: how shall you crypto-mine when your bot is offline?
 AntiSquid: hey dbdr now that you're here can you check PM please? :P
 kovi: Wontonimo (sorry for typo)
 UndercoverToad: does kovi not know about tab completion? :thinking:
 Wontonimo: np kovi.
 Zenoscave: I figured out spacing seeds
 reCurse: I think it's better to tab them
 Zenoscave: &gt;65% w/r against previous bot
 Zenoscave: hopefully not too direct optim and works against other
 Zenoscave: I just got the joke reCurse r/wooosh
 reCurse: I specialize in terrible obscure jokes
 reCurse: Definitely spec'd my character wrong
 Wontonimo: well, i guess it's high time i wrote that sim.
 Zenoscave: I specialize in tearable jokes
 Zenoscave: I have em all written down
 Wontonimo: hey, me too&#160;!
 Queuebee: omg me too wtf
 Wontonimo: who would have thought that programmers would have that in common&#160;?
 Zenoscave: everyone.
 ClockSort: my jokes cannot be torn.
 kovi: i never used single spacing...except on c64

 DetoBot: :scream:
 reCurse: Still a better bot than automaton
 Zenoscave: &gt;75% w/r ran more tests. the confidence 99% CI is .73 - .85
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000 you gonna let him speak like that
 Automaton2000: and this is how i feel about that
 Zenoscave: So yes.
 DetoBot: that was an KO
 Zenoscave: I can't wait for silver so I can submit this version
 DetoBot: detonate that bot Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what will be the other way around
 limakk: Automaton2000&#160;: p
 DetoBot: make him friend Automation2000
 Automaton2000: its because i dont understand
 DetoBot: him, yes! Automaton2000
 limakk: Automaton2000 u code&#160;?
 Automaton2000: could be a good one
 Automaton2000: i had the same idea
 reCurse: A single mention and already killed the chat with it
 DetoBot: that's the problem with curiosity
 Rabeeb: how long for silver?
 Zenoscave: My bad ...
 Rabeeb: no hour shown, only days
 reCurse: See that's where a real bot is useful
 reCurse: Would parse "when" and answer "soon"
 Zenoscave: soon
 TheBatMan_TM: yeah reCurse it's reCurse(ive) omg i suck at jokes
 reCurse: Agreed
 jacek: :tada:
 DetoBot: define "real"? bot would be human?
 reCurse: A bot with a purpose let's say
 reCurse: Not a waste of bytes
 Zenoscave: *Several* bytes
 Marchete: your purpose is passing butter
 reCurse:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: oh god
 DetoBot: :joy:
 Westicles: Isn't it usually top 40% at 6pm france time?
 reCurse: You search for meaning where there's none
 MSmits: where? Life?
 reCurse: CG too
 MSmits: cg is part of life
 reCurse: Indeed
 DetoBot: meaning defined
 reCurse: Definition not meaning
 DetoBot: my bad
 Rabeeb: how many hours to open silver league?
 Westicles: We find patterns and pretend we are alive
 reCurse: I spot a pattern alright
 AceTea: Do you know when the gold and silver league should open&#160;?
 MSmits: a pattern is only a pattern when it occurs more than once
 reCurse: Help
 Marchete: do you know when wood 2 will open?
 KalamariKing: whenever they feel like it AceTea why so pushy
 Rabeeb: silver shows 10 may, but no hour
 Nerchio: give me silver
 Zenoscave: Ban anyone who asks it again.
 Zenoscave: just the first one
 Westicles: yar, sliver me liver
 Zenoscave: teach a lesson
 MSmits: asks what Zenoscave? 
 Zenoscave: nice try
 MSmits: :grin:
 Rabeeb: yeah, asks what Zeno
 reCurse: I have renounced to my janitor powers
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid ban time
 MSmits: you still have a cd thingy reCurse, whatever that is
 reCurse: Only for use in extreme urgency
 Rabeeb: janitor powers? @reCurse
 reCurse: Yeah, the holy mop of CG
 azriel1rf: @solaimanope the key feature is shadow. casting shadow to my tree is bad, on the other hand,  to opponent's is good. moreover, grow for avoiding to be casted shadow.
 reCurse: Wiped the blood of countless students
 MSmits: there's a growth limit azriel1rf, trees are maxed out pretty fast
 reCurse: Just here for contest banter and probably disappear after
 MSmits: and you cant outgrow shadows then
 MSmits: reCurse so there is no smurf?
 Westicles: Can't argue with results.  Is the the top non-sim?
 Westicles: *he
 Zenoscave: 789 wins out of 1000 I think this'll jump ranks nicely
 DetoBot: :white_circle: =&gt; :soon:
 reCurse: I'm not here to talk about the contest, just here for crap talk
 Zenoscave: :popcorn:
 MSmits: I noticed you are avoiding the smurf question, but that is ok&#160;:)
 azriel1rf: MSmits, you said it.grow is powerful if sizes are small.
 Chainman: crap=chinese rap&#160;?
 reCurse: The whole point of smurfing is to maintain uncertainty
 reCurse: It's fun
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: So why would I answer
 Zenoscave: Got my popcorn ready for the server shitsshow
 MSmits: sometimes a nonanswer is also an answer
 MSmits: and sometimes it's not
 Zenoscave: or is it gonna be a just transfer?
 MSmits: up to us to discern
 Hujing: Does anyone know at what time they wanted to unlock silver league?
 DetoBot: :eyes:
 DetoBot: Ban Ban Ban
 reCurse: Next week
 UndercoverToad: i don't think there will be a resubmit
 Zenoscave: thx UndercoverToad
 Astrobytes: When you stop asking.
 Marchete: but silver, when?
 chop-chop: !when
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes must be miffed rn
 Astrobytes: why?
 Zenoscave: you sound miffed
 Zenoscave: in my head, but still
 MSmits: it's easy to make you sound miffed Astrobytes because you're so nice
 Astrobytes: lol, no just bored.
 azriel1rf: seed is the same thing. seed to cell not casted shadow is good.When we watch top bot's battle, they often avoid shadow when seeding.
 peerdb: Is it possible to run the source code of the challenge locally on my pc for debugging? and if so, how?
 MSmits: azriel1rf that's my next thing to add 
 Marchete: azriel1rf avoid future shadows, no?
 Zenoscave: peerdb no clue
 azriel1rf: avoid future shadow, yes
 Marchete: ok
 jacek: but current shadow doesnt matter now does it
 MSmits: it does, but beamsearch can fix current shadow
 MSmits: it cant fix long term shadow
 Westicles: Should be lots of hiders this time?  Strategy seems more important than usual
 Marchete: current shadow only is used at first step of the day
 Zenoscave: I have a feeling there's at least a couple
 Marchete: so it's pretty irrelevant imo
 MSmits: hmm dont agree
 CameronWatt: test
 MSmits: it's only 1 day yes
 Marchete: why
 MSmits: but expansion has some exponential component
 MSmits: sooner sunpoints are more useful than later
 UndercoverToad: good point, i still want to add a decay factor
 Marchete: sooner sunpoints?
 Zenoscave: ooh now adding to my todo
 MSmits: sunpoints you win early
 Marchete: well, that maybe it's part of the eval decay
 Zenoscave: early to rise early to win
 Marchete: you have or smth
 MSmits: sure, depends a lot on how you code it
 Marchete: ok
 Marchete: ofc the earlier the better
 CameronWatt: time to get back into the industry after a traumatic experience with an extremely toxic company. it has been almost 10 months. starting with some c# excersizes here. wish me luck.
 Marchete: like occupy places first if it's beneficial
 Marchete: wish you luck
 MSmits: i think avoiding shadow is waaayyy more important than some richness points
 CameronWatt: thanks mate
 DetoBot: good luck 
 MSmits: in early game that is
 CameronWatt: thx
 DetoBot: shadows makes this game alive
 Marchete: richness is only important because its on the center
 MSmits: Marchete you found this when placing a bunch of trees in the center right
 Marchete: so it casts more shadow
 DetoBot: who exploits it, win?
 MSmits: that shaded eachother
 Marchete: I agree about shadow
 MSmits: anything thats in the center casts more shadow and receives more shadow
 azriel1rf: it seems that some top bot occupies cell to defend opponent's seeding
 Marchete: that game is more about sun management + sun capture
 Marchete: it's interesting
 Counterbalance: peerdb: one way is to print the input, copy &amp; save that to a text file, and run in visual studio with debug arggument "&lt; input.txt"
 UndercoverToad: really?
 Marchete: because costs are count related
 UndercoverToad: mine just drops 2 seeds at once because it's stupid and I fail to prevent it&#160;:(
 reCurse: It's more about totoro
 MSmits: you can hardcode against it
 Marchete: I mean, euler, you are top10
 Marchete: I'm just saying nonsenses as usual
 UndercoverToad: no hardcoding for this, i want to solve the root problem
 reCurse: Nice
 MSmits: pun intended?
 UndercoverToad: no :D
 Zenoscave: is one seed at a time worth while for the pruning factor? Or are there better solutions
 UndercoverToad: but now that you point it out I wish it was
 jacek: you need better seed for rng for monte carlo
 Zenoscave: I dont do MC
 MSmits: Zenoscave for sure prune 3 seeds at a time
 MSmits: i dont that ever happens
 MSmits: think
 Zenoscave: so only do up to a second seed?
 Zenoscave: hm...
 MSmits: 2 seeds... i see it sometimes, i guess there are rare occasions. Like when your income is high and you need it to grow faster
 Zenoscave: one sec gotta test
 kamaci: pyhton coders are lucky
 kamaci: on clash
 azriel1rf: To anyone using monte carlo or beam search, you see only hero's moves? or with opponent's move?
 reCurse: Said no one ever
 KaizenGTD: shouldn't be already open the silver league?
 MSmits: azriel1rf at least at first, ignore opponent
 reCurse: No
 UndercoverToad: using beam, assuming opponent is WAITing
 MSmits: later on you can include opponent actions based on some assumptions
 azriel1rf: MSmits, thanks
 MSmits: but it's always gonna be guesswork
 MSmits: UndercoverToad do you not make assumptions for growth?
 MSmits: i mean seeding sure... but he will grow his trees
 jacek: or complete if available?
 Wontonimo: azriel1rf i don't have a sim yet for this one, but in other monticarlo it does both mine and opponent
 azriel1rf: MSmits, do you compare board in other days? like 2 days after and 3 days after.
 kovi: seeding is guesswork, but growing can be predicted
 UndercoverToad: i just consider static opponent trees
 itzluku: thought silver would be open by now?
 UndercoverToad: league opening is a manual process
 UndercoverToad: blame SaiksyApo
 MSmits: UndercoverToad then you do something with eval for shadow, because you cant just assume an opponent 2 size tree will forever not shade your 3 size tree
 itzluku: oki
 UndercoverToad: i *should* do something
 UndercoverToad: but I don't
 MSmits: i am really surprised your bot does so well without that
 itzluku: im thinking about checking shadows for seeds liek this&#160;: assume every tree on the board is t3
 MSmits: is your seeding smarter then?
 azriel1rf: Wontonimo, thanks. Monte carlo is powerful to simultaneous game because it's hard to search mini-max.
 limakk: silver opened
 limakk: :p
 UndercoverToad: testing all possible locations (aka a lot)
 MSmits: damn
 MSmits: well gj, my bot supposedly does what yours does then, except maybe my eval is crap
 UndercoverToad: that's what costs most of my sim time
 Westicles: The russians say: For 13 trees, the most favorable arrangement (calculated for 6 days) is as follows: [0, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36]
 MSmits: what depth do you search to?
 AntiSquid: all possible locations from all possible trees
 UndercoverToad: meh, there are rocks and opponents interfering with those numbers
 Jackieckc: when is silver league opened?
 jacek: ^
 UndercoverToad: won't hardcode any of this, my bot has to find it on its own
 MSmits: it's like the 8 queens problem
 Donald_D._Doge: when is silver opening Jackieckc
 UndercoverToad: silver should open any minute now
 MSmits: do you allow seeding with a 1 size tree UndercoverToad?
 UndercoverToad: yes, why not?
 Smelty: wait when does silver open-
 UndercoverToad: a shadow can't stop me
 MSmits: cuz it means your tree will be next to the old one
 MSmits: ah ok..
 Wontonimo: azriel1rf i'm not sure how i'm going to do monte carlo for this one, probably as 2 competing trees.
 Lucky30_: guys i am losing hope again hhh
 UndercoverToad: so many actions, monte carlo doesn't find much here (at least my attempts failed)
 MSmits: UndercoverToad maybe you have a shadow map as part of your eval score
 MSmits: that would maybe explain why you do so well
 UndercoverToad: i just simulate until the end of the game to count suns
 UndercoverToad: which is expensive
 MSmits: until the end of the game&#160;!!
 Zenoscave: how many full games do you sim?
 UndercoverToad: :sun: B)
 MSmits: and this is beamsearch?
 KalamariKing: Anyone wanna nyoom through my code and see why it doesn't work
 UndercoverToad: no sun?&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: :sunshine:
 Zenoscave: probably not
 MSmits: ohhh wait
 UndercoverToad: :sunny: B)
 KalamariKing: :sunny:
 DetoBot: :sunny:
 dbdr: :sun_with_face:
 DetoBot: lol
 AntiSquid: ban
 MSmits: UndercoverToad when you do this sim, do you include growth?
 KalamariKing: y'all broke my chat there
 Queuebee: :new_moon_with_face:
 UndercoverToad: dbdr you still own me chat logs from May 8th
 KalamariKing: there's now a permanent unread blip
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid if you were a metal album you'd be called "ban 'em all"
 AntiSquid: i told him exact same thing UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: sorry smits, question hour is over here
 Lucky30_: KalamariKing i would if it heps me understand this contest some 
 Lucky30_: more
 MSmits: hehe ah well, cant blame me for trying&#160;:)
 dbdr: UndercoverToad I don't own anyone anything&#160;;)
 dbdr: *owe
 KalamariKing: Lucky30_ you good with java? here you go either way
 KalamariKing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d84f3c3d-6b50-4d63-aba4-05ff2c2781a4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d84f3c3d-6b50-4d63-aba4-05ff2c2781a4</a>
 Smelty: well guess ill know when silver opens because my rank will go up
 UndercoverToad: yes you do, I DEMAND it
 UndercoverToad: i'm entitled to it
 dbdr: :P
 Lucky30_: not really hhhh
 KalamariKing: Lucky30_ it doesn't work tho so don't expect anything
 Lucky30_: copy past incoming
 Zenoscave: KalamariKing Probably shouldn't post such large code samples during contests
 KalamariKing: Zenoscave you have a point
 MSmits: yes dont do that KalamariKing
 Donald_D._Doge: KalamariKing stop sharing contest code in chat @_@
 KalamariKing: wow y'all are angy
 KalamariKing: it would be bad if it worked
 UndercoverToad: it didn't even share the full code because it was too much
 Donald_D._Doge: not yet
 Wontonimo: oh, really like it when i see the first 10 games come back as all wins ... so satisfying 
 MSmits: mostly seems sim code, thankfull
 Zenoscave: People have been stripped of the rankand disqualified for it KalamariKing
 Donald_D._Doge: on this site there's no sharing like that during contest .
 reCurse: Also rolled in tar and feathers, sad stuff
 UndercoverToad: code sharing is taken serious here. at least for contests
 Donald_D._Doge: oh yes that part
 Donald_D._Doge: best part
 Westicles: The guy is in wood1
 Smelty: hi reCurs :0
 Donald_D._Doge: and chased around the village with pitchforks
 Wontonimo: oh, it's java code ... meh
 Zenoscave: Did you know the amount of stimulus given by the american government ($600) was enough to buy tar and feathers in an amount to cover a greaseball politician?
 reCurse: Oh boy.
 reCurse: Hai
 KalamariKing: Where are the global leaderboards btw
 AntiSquid: silver

 limakk: site slow&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: oh god all bots submitted???
 FiddleChives: hey guys 
 ZarthaxX: noooooooooooo
 ZarthaxX: cg is gonna die
 Queuebee: lol
 cegprakash: nooooo
 reCurse: They don't do mass submits anymore
 azriel1rf: I PROMOTED TO SILVER
 Zenoscave: naw just transfered
 UndercoverToad: that's a huge silver&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i don't see any resub
 ZarthaxX: ah nvm lol
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: i saw battles and got scared
 Ajaiy2: TOP 1000
 Ajaiy2: YESSSSS
 ClockSort: congrats to all silvers :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: it's a 40% silver lol
 Smelty: xDD
 reCurse: Silver is almost always a non-event
 Zenoscave: Anti was right
 Zenoscave: botg best
 reCurse: Just a smaller bronze
 ZarthaxX: xp was given?
 fvla: sooo...when does Gold open?
 Smelty: lol
 AntiSquid: it's always around 50% cut off
 AntiSquid: well less but ...
 Westicles: 28%
 The_ZimaBlue: silver is here...
 Queuebee: YES 504 is back!
 AntiSquid: 1.8k from 5k&#160;?
 The_ZimaBlue: many people transferred
 UndercoverToad: i got the 100XP for silver twice<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/12rnvh6">https://prnt.sc/12rnvh6</a>
 ZarthaxX: nice toad
 cegprakash: crashed lol
 Wontonimo: NOOOOOO&#160;!!!!!
 AntiSquid: oh 504
 Wontonimo: i submitted right before Silver opened
 UndercoverToad: beginner's mistake
 Wontonimo: and now i'm battling though bonze!
 ZarthaxX: u will get there anyway
 Wontonimo: when i ranked higher than the bot
 DetoBot: same here
 UndercoverToad: but could be worse, like a full resubmit that makes the page unusable for some hours
 cegprakash: what rank is bronze boss right now
 Wontonimo: yeah ZarthaxX, thanks
 UndercoverToad: 1874 in silver
 reCurse: Better do the mistake in silver than legend
 DetoBot: yes SIR
 Zenoscave: I did it in legend in fall
 Wontonimo: tru dat reCurse
 Zenoscave: err gold -&gt; legend
 UndercoverToad: legend promotion is fast, only a few players in resubmit on opening
 reCurse: There are no resubmits anymore
 ClockSort: love the username @undercovertoad
 UndercoverToad: i think for legend there were
 reCurse: Hm
 UndercoverToad: once they asked if they shall just shift or resubmit for legend
 UndercoverToad: here on chat
 UndercoverToad: and I was like RESUBMIT!!!
 AntiSquid: maybe if it's small 
 Lucky30_: KalamariKing -&gt; line 312 should be outside the for loop
 Wontonimo: time to make a sandwich 
 Zenoscave: when does gold open
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 <b>**UndercoverToad slaps Zenoscave around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/61978887534411" /> AntiSquid: ok, get me one too Wontonimo
 Zenoscave: poof you are a sandwich Wontonimo
 Scarfield: proof you are a sandwich
 Wontonimo: may i recommend to the maintainers of this system, only promote a few people at a time no matter how many beat the boss.  Like thottle it to 1 per 15 seconds or something
 Jokras: Do you have to resubmit?
 reCurse: Your request has been submitted to /dev/null.
 Zenoscave: ln -s backlog /dev/null
 Zenoscave: or whatever order ln works in
 Wontonimo: echo "please fix something" &gt; /dev/null
 UndercoverToad: that would mean it takes 450min or 7.5h to promote everyone
 limakk: what is the minimum score to promote to silver
 UndercoverToad: i can already see the rant
 dbdr: use &gt;&gt;. you don't want to lose the beginning of /dev/null
 reCurse: True
 Wontonimo: Zenoscave i thought it was just me that could never ermember the order of ln -s
 Lucky30_: rm -rf / 
 nitekat: why didn't I promoted to silver :cry:
 Wontonimo: lol dbdr&#160;!!
 Zenoscave: was your bot still finishing a submit nitekat
 UndercoverToad: either ranked too low or submit still in progress nikekat
 Zenoscave: tab euler
 The_ZimaBlue: i tested loser code in arena after making my new code....so i did not get transferred to silver league
 UndercoverToad: did the 2nd letter wrong and it didn't work
 nitekat: oh maybe still in finishing... I thought it was finished... just WAIT   thanx
 The_ZimaBlue: so how do i get transferred not
 Zenoscave: whoops
 cegprakash: I can't see bronze boss
 UndercoverToad: instead of fixing my type i wrote the name wrong as I didn't see it at first
 Zenoscave: It's ok, I'll forgive you UndercoverToad
 CameronWatt: this is a fun way to get back into coding
 The_ZimaBlue: i guess there needs to be a boss to get transferred
 The_ZimaBlue: but there is none
 cegprakash: I see boss now
 Westicles: I see Catboss
 The_ZimaBlue: yah
 ChristianDowns: How do you progress?
 cegprakash: cat boss at rank 9
 The_ZimaBlue: a few seconds back
 reCurse: Love the totoro theme
 ashiknur: default AI is too dumb in silver
 Marchete: error 504
 ClockSort: defeat catboss lol
 Zenoscave: ashiknur the default AI is meant to be an easy target (or a mostly WAIT target)
 ClockSort: second best username (cat loses to toad)
 gmessier: Due to COVID, no more space is left in the Silver league to keep social distanciation. Sorry for the inconveniences.
 reCurse: It's ok we're all coders, social distance is already maintained
 Zenoscave: I go outside!! About once a week
 ChristianDowns: how do you challenge the AI?
 Wontonimo: many years ago i made that mistake on a prod server Lucky30_. I meant to type 'rm -rf ./'
 cegprakash: Bronze boss is super weak
 The_ZimaBlue: it is harder to beat catboss than to be in the top 100 and get transferred
 Marchete: top400 to gold?
 Zenoscave: I hope so
 ZVRKK: Why we have same bot in silver :thinking:?
 Lucky30_: Wontonimo life is hard
 AntiSquid: 25% promote to gold or so
 AntiSquid: just watch .
 Tuo: Promotion to Silver League in&#160;:00H 00MN 00SC
 Tuo: Jipii
 Tuo: Altought its stuck :D
 ashiknur: I can't see the updated statement
 AbsentMoon: How are people able to simulate the whole game in under 100ms? 
 Zenoscave: ashiknur there is no update in silver
 limakk: boss becomes hard :p
 Zenoscave: AbsentMoon no one
 DetoBot: I will never ever will resubmit before a transition :expressionless:
 reCurse: That's 6 frames of your favorite game AbsentMoon, plenty of time.
 Lucky30_: my old stupid code got 94 vs catboss  100... but my current one can't do half that score... i give up
 Westicles: It is too close, though.  Should have made the grid one size bigger
 cegprakash: cat boss got rekt 
 azriel1rf: how can i see cat boss
 Wontonimo: catboss be at like rank 90
 Wontonimo: you can search in "Leaderboard" while in ide
 Wontonimo: ^^ azriel1rf
 azriel1rf: thanks
 DetoBot: damn
 DetoBot: catboss must rise
 Chainman: Wow in silver league :innocent:
 DetoBot: again silver is getting crowded
 Alonius: How do you print a message in-game?
 MoMaT: yeah, 2k people in silver? I don't remember number this high in any contest.
 reCurse: Contest is more popular than usual too
 Marchete: last one was 1913 on silver
 MoMaT: bbut Fall2020 had 7k bots overall.
 itzluku: echo "cringe" &gt; cringecollection.txt
 azriel1rf: Alonius, print "COMMAND message"
 Marchete: excluding wood1 and 2
 reCurse: At the end. Not now.
 Marchete: it may be similar
 Wontonimo: for example"WAIT the end is near!"
 MoMaT: I guess that's what happens when the wood bosses pose zero challenge.
 ddreams: that's good
 DetoBot: leagues bosses are never alone
 Alonius: Thanks!
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl how do I pass some &lt;input.txt in VS Code?
 Chainman: The league will get bigger though as people beat the boss
 ZarthaxX: Marchete i think you cant
 ZarthaxX: have already gone through that
 DetoBot: 8% more to be in silver c'mon
 ZarthaxX: cant put in config
 Chainman: 8%?
 reCurse: Is it in c++
 Marchete: C#
 ashiknur: it's not interesting that the problem of bronze and silver are same
 Chainman: I like how it is right now though, allows more improvement. 
 Wontonimo: oh, what's interesting is that the competition is harder
 DetoBot: spells again&#160;:/
 Chainman: I don't want more variables added haha, 
 Wontonimo: agreed Chainman
 Chainman: optimize what exists already. 
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo now that silver opened? :P
 reCurse: ashiknur: So competition only matters in legend league where the real full game is revealed?
 Chainman: indeed
 DetoBot: :dizzy_face:
 Chainman: :sweat_smile:
 Wontonimo: my last battles are taking FOREVER.  I'll be in silver for sure, just have to wait.  currently 17th in bronze.  boss is around 90th
 Jokras: Promotion to Silver League in&#160;:00H 00MN 00SC
 jke: promotion to silver seems to be stuck
 Wontonimo: did they announce that silver was opening?   man, i'm not going to resubmit so close to opening again.  this is so painful
 ddreams: silver is already open
 Wontonimo: yeah i know.  i was just wondering if they announced the exact hour / min
 reCurse: They never do
 reCurse: It's usually at this time +/- 2 hours
 DetoBot: Got promoted, :upside_down:
 Jokras: Why dosn't it work?
 ddreams: server overload
 Wontonimo: it take a little while Jokras ... be patient
 ddreams: (I guess)
 Jokras: Ok
 Wontonimo: noone is moving fast atm
 Marchete: on VS Code having a launch.json with that line
 Marchete:             "args": ["&lt;input.txt"],
 Marchete: does the trick to read from a file
 UndercoverToad: that works for you?
 Marchete: yes
 ZarthaxX: i tried that one and it didnt work
 UndercoverToad: oh, i tried "&lt; input.txt"
 UndercoverToad: and failed
 reCurse: I thought that was the shell doing that... interesting
 ZarthaxX: the space is the problem???
 UndercoverToad: then changed it to "&lt;", "input.txt"
 Marchete: I'm on windoes
 Marchete: windows
 reCurse: Same thing
 Marchete: ahh
 if-loop69420: whens wood league promotions happening?
 UndercoverToad: i think yours would work too. just the space
 ddreams: if-loop: continuously
 Marchete: lazyness is a plus
 if-loop69420: well im 1st and im not promoted yet
 UndercoverToad: or lack of style
 UndercoverToad: did your submit reach 100% yet?
 if-loop69420:&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: is there a red circle at your name on the leaderboard?
 ddreams: in "Last Battles", there's a completion percentage 
 if-loop69420: yes
 if-loop69420: that has to reach 100%&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: wait till the circle is gone
 if-loop69420: oh 
 if-loop69420: ok 
 if-loop69420: thx
 if-loop69420: how long does that take?
 gmessier: The time for your bot to have ~100 battles
 if-loop69420: kk
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: in silver its more like 200
 reCurse: You wish
 UndercoverToad: exactly 100 in my history. and some are from other players fighting me
 RoboStac: only because so many resubmitted at the moment - it's a fixed number of battles you start, but you get put into battles other resubmits start
 UndercoverToad: so probably 90 games that you get yourself
 Smelty: hmm
 MadKnight: oh silver is already opened? i think i've overslept it
 Smelty: it opened 40 mins
 MadKnight: oh well let's go back to sleep Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i had issues with that
 reCurse: Oh right I missed the resubmits causing more games.
 UndercoverToad: and now I got an email informing me about silver
 Smelty: hmm yes
 UndercoverToad: Hello, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e0015c3-d0c9-40e0-a88f-56897e06075f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e0015c3-d0c9-40e0-a88f-56897e06075f</a>

 ddreams: uh, what is going wrong when my bot performs worse when given more time? :p
 reCurse: Analysis paralysis
 emh: don't buy Calvados
 emh: it tastes like rotten apples
 Smelty: lol
 reCurse: Noted
 KalamariKing: Ok this time I won't paste source
 KalamariKing: However
 KalamariKing: A java.util.NoSuchElementException on (Scanner).nextInt means there was nothing to read, right
 KalamariKing: Also: the inputs are per-turn or per-day
 Wontonimo: ddreams - that is a great indication you have a bug or a poor heuristic
 Zenoscave: per-turn
 Jokras: Is it normal that ther is still Promotion to Silver League in&#160;:00H 00MN 00SC
 ddreams: yeah, the heuristic is probably pretty bad
 fvla: KalamariKing: i mean, for the first question, you can literally look up the Java documentation
 Wontonimo: a really good heuristic is - did it win.  not kidding.
 fvla: inputs are indeed per-turn, not per-day; you receive updated board state after every turn.
 KalamariKing: Ok thank you
 KalamariKing: There's the issue then
 ddreams: yeah, but I don't simulate the opponent, so I don't know what he'll get
 ddreams: I should try to do that probably
 gmessier: IMO, don't care about the opponent until you are in top 100 (but I will let the real top 100 give their answers)
 7amasa: is promotion to silver stuck or smth?
 UndercoverToad: i can assure you that you can reach top10 without simulating the opponent (at this early stage of the contest at least)
 ddreams: at least three of the top 10 are ignoring the opponent
 ddreams: but they are probably much smarter with their heuristic than me
 ddreams: and faster
 Alonius: Is there a way to export games to files?
 UndercoverToad: i'm just throwing some CPU at it without being clever
 struct: hi
 limakk: hi struct
 struct: How many were promoted to silver?
 limakk: 1886
 cegprakash: promotion is kinda stuck
 struct: those are the current ones
 struct: But when it opened
 cegprakash: it says I'll be promoted in 0 secs but I'm not
 Jokras: me too
 Zenoscave: ~1850 struct
 struct: im thinking on getting the i9-10850K
 struct: anyone has it?
 Lucky30_: :flushed:
 reCurse: Why not the 11th gen
 Lucky30_: i have i3 10th.. 
 struct: Are they released?
 Zenoscave: I think I have ryzen 5??? I don't know what my cpu is.

 struct: 11900
 Lucky30_: please stop.. i am sad... i live in the past
 Schneewittchen: Ryzen 5gen and really happy with it
 Schneewittchen: lol *3rd gen :D
 KalamariKing: What about gpus
 KalamariKing: I have a ryzen 3700x but only a 1030
 reCurse: They don't exist
 Schneewittchen: Oh god there is none
 reCurse: Only in legends
 ddreams: I tried a laptop with the i9-10980HK, then changed it for a Ryzen 5900HX
 Schneewittchen: Even my old gpu solds on ebay for &gt;400 
 Schneewittchen: This is insane
 KalamariKing: Gpus are nowhere
 ddreams: was a bit better compile performance, but nothing insane
 struct: 11th gen out of stock&#160;:(
 struct: at least in portugal
 reCurse: rip
 jrke: so we are in silver for the second time in the contest
 Lucky30_: good for you sir
 Schneewittchen: Buy in spain. Sometime they got some
 AntiSquid: should i try to sell GPU at auction? :thinking:
 Schneewittchen: For sure
 Schneewittchen: But how to get a new one? :D
 reCurse: If you're desperate for cash and aren't looking to get a gpu in the next 3 years sure
 AntiSquid: yes one of the newer ones
 Schneewittchen: You'll roughly double your spend
 AntiSquid: ah i just wait for them to reappear
 reCurse: I'd say 3 years before it's back to normal
 ddreams: some of the more expensive ones (3090's) appeared to become more available last time I looked
 struct: yeah I saw 3090 for 2700‚Ç¨ on stock
 ddreams: they're not so attractive for miners
 Zenoscave: 2700‚Ç¨&#160;!? That's absurd
 struct: its not FE
 AntiSquid: weren't the 3k series advertised to be about same price as the 2k series last year? :D
 KalamariKing: Yup
 Schneewittchen: Even the 3070s for over 1000
 KalamariKing: The 3060 was supposed to be like $350 usd
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/cfmvPX1.png">https://i.imgur.com/cfmvPX1.png</a>
 ddreams: a friend of mine sold his 3080 for about $1900 and bought a 3070 instead
 AntiSquid: wanted to build another pc . but ... nvm
 ddreams: insane
 struct: Those are the only ones in stock
 KalamariKing: What about Big Navi
 KalamariKing: The AMD cards
 Westicles: I wouldn't buy 14nm intel.  Stuck in one node for 7 years
 KalamariKing: Why do you all prefer intel? AMD runs cooler and has better price/perf
 KalamariKing: And AMD didn't release the exact same chip under a different name this year :eyes:
 ddreams: I'm with my first AMD now
 Codechaos: Hi, is there a guide on how to compare AIs locally? I looked at brutaltester but as it seems I need a referee for it. Is there any guide or prebuild referee for the current challenge?
 AntiSquid: i have AMD works great
 KalamariKing: PLUS you don't have to buy a whole new mobo when you want to upgrade, all ryzen's use am4
 JP7: Are u baiting? Whos stanning intel? 
 KalamariKing: Literally scroll up
 struct: amd prices are not that better over here
 AntiSquid: "stanning" @_@#
 struct: maybe if I buy from spain
 Wontonimo: Codechaos the referee for this game is published.  look at the docs
 ddreams: Codechaos: Zenoscave has generously shared one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 Wontonimo: oh, that's even better
 Wontonimo: THANKS Zenoscave&#160;!!
 reCurse: There's no stanning but I've had so many problems from AMD over 20 years I'll pass
 Zenoscave: I don't recall giving this in public chat but yw&#160;;)
 Lysk: I'm getting "player has negative score" with Zenoscave referee
 Zenoscave: Means timeout. 
 Zenoscave: if your pc has other processes going on timeouts are still enforced
 Zenoscave: or you are using wood league
 struct: cant you change time allowed?
 Lysk: ha! good point, how to check for the league?
 Zenoscave: in the invokation add -Dleague.level=3 before -jar
 Lysk: got it, lemme try
 7amasa: is silver stuck guys or?
 ddreams: lol, nice, I commented out the wood leagues in the code :D
 Codechaos: That's incredible thank you!
 ddreams: you can change time allowed, but there's a hard cap of 30s in total for each game
 Zenoscave: nope the timelimit errors about 30000 milliseconds if you up the time per move
 struct: cheapest place I can get is from germany :D
 ddreams: however, you can download the game engine from codingame and change the hard timeout
 Zenoscave: and how do you link it to your bot?
 Zenoscave: *ref
 ddreams: you have to recompile using local maven packages
 Counterbalance: update the engine version in the pom
 King_Coda: So, what's happened since I've been dark for 5 days?
 King_Coda: So many new people coming into chat
 King_Coda: I wonder why :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: contest time King_Coda
 Ashbury: Promotion to Silver League in&#160;:00H 00MN 00SC since 30 minutes. Is it a bug&#160;? x)
 Westicles: King, we have been waiting on your puberty updates
 King_Coda: My Puberty updates?
 King_Coda: Since when were those a thing?
 KalamariKing: King_Coda!
 King_Coda: KalamariKing!
 KalamariKing: that was some fast typing
 ddreams: tab-completion
 King_Coda: I am a speedrunner after all
 King_Coda: hey, don't out me like that ddreams
 ddreams: still fast tho
 TobiasA: ayyy King_Coda
 King_Coda: TobiasA!
 King_Coda: Sorry I've been gone, these past few days have been hella wack, but i'm back now
 TobiasA: do you have a bot for me to steal?
 Wontonimo: print("WAIT")
 Ashbury: Any intel on silver promotion not coming?
 Wontonimo: ^^ there ya go
 jke: we're in a new league between bronze and silver... the limbo league
 King_Coda: How has everyone been during the contest?
 Zenoscave: sleed depreived King_Coda
 King_Coda: I'm still in wood league...&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: sleep
 King_Coda: Lol, me too Zenoscave
 ParticleBeam: Need a Wheatly contest. Who can design the worse bot possible...
 TobiasA: i've wondering how people run thousands of simulations in a short period of time. anyone know how
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 reCurse: Magic
 Zenoscave: magic
 Smelty: xD
 King_Coda: magic
 Zenoscave: dammit reCurse
 Smelty: magic
 TobiasA: hehe
 King_Coda: Hahahaha
 TobiasA: i thought so
 King_Coda: I love this chat sometimes
 Nerchio: C++
 King_Coda: C#
 Smelty: and not python
 M1kep: I'm guessing... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 Smelty: perhaps
 nitekat: or borrow space x's computer
 King_Coda: Yup
 tarikyildiz: What should I know about in order not to get stuck in codingame questions?
 TobiasA: because the last time i checked it takes more than a second to print something 10,000 times
 King_Coda: Sure yeah, just steal from Elon Musk
 M1kep: Something about adding a runner here&#160;:) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/test/java/Spring2021.java#L30-L34">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/test/java/Spring2021.java#L30-L34</a>
 King_Coda: Well, if you have a 10 Ghz processor, then 10,000 processes per second should be easy!
 King_Coda: All you have to do is use 100% of your cpu!
 Zenoscave: not sure that's what Amdahl meant
 King_Coda: With no work being given to your gpu at all, you'll have a black screen
 King_Coda: In fact, you won't even have a functional PC
 King_Coda: :D
 Smelty: hah two different versions of my bot tied <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551360213">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551360213</a>
 tarikyildiz: What should I know about in order not to get stuck in codingame questions?
 King_Coda: ezpz
 King_Coda: Upgrade your ram from 4 gb to 128 gb
 Smelty: gee, the community here is really helpful
 King_Coda: it'll only cost you 300$
 King_Coda: no Smelty, i'm just cantankerous :P
 reCurse: Cancerous indeed
 reCurse: Well the questions need to be better for starters
 Smelty: canctanceriousit
 King_Coda:&#160;???????????
 King_Coda: "canctanceriousit"
 Smelty: yes, canctanceriousit
 King_Coda: canc-tancer-iousit
 King_Coda: I-
 King_Coda: Kank tan-ser ee-us-it
 King_Coda:&#160;?
 King_Coda: Explain the etymology of this word please
 Smelty: it is a medical condition in which people cannot say the name "canctanceriousit"
 reCurse: Alright I'm out of here before I use the hammer
 Alonius: Is there a way to export games to files? In order to analyze locally
 Smelty: oop
 Smelty: *run away*
 King_Coda: Where is my father Astro?
 King_Coda: where is the bytes himself
 KalamariKing: He escaped
 Smelty: astrobitesalot
 King_Coda: I need to bore him with my inferior knowledge of C#
 Smelty: lel
 King_Coda: Astrogone
 King_Coda: Astrowenttogetthemilk
 KalamariKing: Gtg boios time for an hour-long bus ride home
 UndercoverToad: Astrobytes has superior C# knowledge?
 King_Coda: Bye KalamariKing
 jc725: is it me, or are some of the questions here poorly worded?
 UndercoverToad: which questions? clash of code?
 King_Coda: UndercoverToad, no, but me and Astro have grown rather fond of each other and now since i'm learning C# I must bore him with updates on my learning
 Smelty: yes, such as yours truly
 UndercoverToad: a poor review process can lead to such an outcome, yes
 King_Coda: If Astro were here he'd know what to do&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: Astrobytes where are you? get your daily news
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: Astrosenpai
 jc725: im doing there is no spoon part 1
 Donald_D._Doge: that toad thing codes in c# buzz him about it too King_Coda
 Smelty: o.o
 King_Coda: Okay Donald_D._Doge
 Smelty: he is a mario euler
 King_Coda: I doubt he's euler
 Donald_D._Doge: me too
 King_Coda: euler actually comes into chat
 jrke: hover over him
 King_Coda: i've talkied with him before
 King_Coda: *talked
 jrke: you will discover the undercover
 Smelty: l-look at undercover's description
 UndercoverToad: i am eulerscheZahl. Do I have to write that from my other account to confirm it?
 Smelty: and you will discover the mysteri
 Donald_D._Doge: jrke that's fake, you can write anything in your profile
 Smelty:&#160;;-;
 Smelty: the reason mods are using alts is cuz they have the full online list, and it lags them out
 jrke: euler give him a proof even to me also
 jrke:&#160;;)
 Donald_D._Doge: probably his little brother or kid
 Smelty: gee
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl = UndercoverToad
 King_Coda: I doubt people would care enough to impersonate other people on here though
 King_Coda: See?
 UndercoverToad: and tab is dead
 jrke: thats why he wrote only for chat in description
 Donald_D._Doge: ya see what i wrote above King_Coda
 Smelty: lMaO
 Donald_D._Doge: it confirms it
 Ashbury: I have "Promotion to Silver League in&#160;:00H 00MN 00SC" since 35 minutes and I am still stuck in bronze. It is a bug?
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: maybe
 jrke: yes Ashbury
 Smelty: edit: yea
 Ashbury: :thinking:
 King_Coda: This website isn't popular enough and the community doesn't care enough about popularity to impersonate another user
 Smelty: .....my code suc
 Donald_D._Doge: Ashbury maybe resubmit
 Smelty: stuck at 1300/1800
 Astrobytes: You pinged?
 ddreams: hmm.. wonder what I need to get graphics to display in the local viewer
 VaseSimion: stuck at 1100 :D
 ddreams: anyone knows?
 Smelty:&#160;; -&#160;;
 King_Coda: Astrobytes
 King_Coda:&#160;!!!!
 Donald_D._Doge: King_Coda i am Astrobytes's alt
 UndercoverToad: Astrobytes you get your daily update about the C# learning process
 Astrobytes: Yes I got the ping before, what?
 Donald_D._Doge: that's how i knew you was typing
 Astrobytes: What C# learning news?
 UndercoverToad: he only wanted to talk to you
 King_Coda: Okay Donald_D._Doge, sure
 Smelty: suuuuuuuure
 King_Coda: Astrobytes, you will be happy to knnow that I learned
 King_Coda: ...
 King_Coda: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
 Smelty: ...
 Donald_D._Doge: you said nobody cares about impersonating others, cmon Man
 King_Coda: :D
 AstroHydes: Hm. Much easier in this chat
 Smelty: it was all part of the master plan to catch imposters
 King_Coda: I didn't mean to ping you Astro
 Smelty: plus astrohyde is his alt
 Donald_D._Doge: ya he has multiple alts
 Smelty: *main alt
 AstroHydes: No. Just one.
 jrke: oh so Astrobytes = AstroHydes
 King_Coda: I believe UndercoverToad pinged you accidentally
 Smelty: ye-
 Donald_D._Doge: Westicles is my other alt Smelty
 Smelty: aand jrk ping
 Noyotens: catboss is dump
 Smelty: go on there and confirm
 King_Coda: WESTICLES DOES HAVE TROLL ACCOUNTS!!!!
 King_Coda: I KNEW IT, ASTRO YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG
 Donald_D._Doge: you'd be my troll account if i had one, writing all caps
 Smelty: lmao.
 Smelty: lesson 1: how to troll the troll
 King_Coda: Astro, i never doubted your superior intellect
 Donald_D._Doge: no worries King_Coda
 AstroHydes: Well, since this chat is a load of fking crap I'll be off again. Thanks for the pings.
 King_Coda: LOL
 Smelty: no master senpai
 Smelty: e
 Westicles: donald_d_squid has half these guys convinced :P
 King_Coda: Hahahahaha! Sorry Astro, we'll try not to ping you again
 Smelty: lmao
 Smelty: B)
 King_Coda: West, approximatley how many troll accounts do you own
 King_Coda: give me an estimation
 jrke: is CG slow again or its my net
 King_Coda: It's probably your 300 ping
 Donald_D._Doge: i need a lol cat on my westiclees account
 Fluxor: @Asgbury: same for me
 Fluxor: I was 105 before the league opening
 King_Coda: *laughs in 200 mbps download*
 King_Coda: *and 6 ping*
 Fluxor: since then I am stuck et 11 in bronze
 Westicles: I don't even have that social achievement for 1 smurf
 Fluxor: I already have re-submit, and I remain stuck in bronze, far above the boss...
 Donald_D._Doge: i am antisquid King_Coda
 Trilusion: Yes, what's wrong with promotion?
 King_Coda: Donald_D._Doge do all mods have alts?
 King_Coda: I didn't know about this until today
 Donald_D._Doge: this is my main
 King_Coda: suuuuuurrreeeee
 Donald_D._Doge: why the reeee&#160;? what did i say wrong&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: I only created my alt account 2 or 3 days ago because the chat became unusable otherwise
 jrke: CG promoted some people to silver early(1st day of contest) and now stopped promotions lol
 UndercoverToad: and I had 2 more alts to test a 4 player game (Kutulu) but deleted both of them
 Donald_D._Doge: i have a follower&#160;!!
 CameronWatt: dang, getting rekd by python coders in clash of code
 CameronWatt: from c#
 Noyotens: who also dislike CATBOSS
 annaproxy: Is it any use timing your code yourself? I often get &gt;100ms when I set a stopwatch around my loop but CG says it's OK
 UndercoverToad: start the timer after reading the first line of input
 UndercoverToad: otherwise you stop the opponent and referee process as well
 gmessier: :point_up:
 Lowz: Question regarding the Spring Chellenge rules: Does anyone know if the spooky shadows apply for trees owned by me casting a shadow on a tree also owned by me? 
 gmessier: yes
 Ard1998: this is weired, just promoted to wood 1 by outputting the first command thats not WAIT and then let let it run for a while :sweat_smile:
 ddreams: Good job
 Maliamnon: random moves are significantly better than no moves&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: wood is meant as an introduction to the game. print valid moves and you are close to promotion already
 Ard1998: true lol
 Astrobytes: Beats a false lol I guess.
 UndercoverToad: the goldboss is the mean guy who doesn't want to let you pass
 ProYd: Hello, does anyone know what is the maximum memory allowed for our AI?
 UndercoverToad: Astrobytes I was about to report the promotion but you were faster&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: 768 mb
 ProYd: thx
 UndercoverToad: because i told someone on #De that I will report it
 UndercoverToad: switched tabs and you were typing already
 Astrobytes: Yes UndercoverToad, too many incoming complaints about it!
 UndercoverToad: should we ping Thibaud?
 jrke: i think staff are already aware of that
 RoboStac: people have pinged him in the challenge channel
 UndercoverToad: is this just a feeling?
 UndercoverToad: ah
 UndercoverToad: i muted that channel, too much noise
 Astrobytes: Was Julien that fixed the issues last time, not online though
 UndercoverToad: i know
 UndercoverToad: but he also caused the issue
 UndercoverToad: saiksy offline too
 Astrobytes: That's why it would be helpful if he were around&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: oh, he's online here
 cegprakash: last I saw saiksy was playing rocket league
 struct: stuck on level 29 forever
 struct: Will delete fix it?
 Astrobytes: lol
 UndercoverToad: 29 is enough to edit approved puzzles
 UndercoverToad: afk cat time
 struct: it is yes
 struct: But im still silver&#160;:(
 cegprakash: can everyone stop submitting till I get promoted just saying it might fix things
 Astrobytes: It won't.
 struct: ah sorry had no idea
 struct: let me just submit this version
 cegprakash: struct nooo
 Mourfette: sorry if it was asked a lot already but what does silver add to the game?
 Wontonimo: nothing
 Mourfette: no new rules? ok
 Wontonimo: you are just in competition with harder bots
 Mourfette: ok
 Scarfield: no new rules, but a lot of questions about when it opens
 Mourfette: but it is open
 Trilusion: but the promotion is tuck
 Wontonimo: it is ... if you were lucky.  i'm stuck in "waiting to promote"
 Trilusion: *stuck
 Wontonimo: i thought the t was an f
 Mourfette: ah, well I'm far from trying for that, still a lot to do and lacking time
 Westicles: Dumb question... why does wood boss get to 800 bronze?
 Wontonimo: what you mean Westi
 AntiSquid: wood boss got promoted? :joy:
 Westicles: If you submit it I mean
 Noyotens: catboss :rage:
 AntiSquid: ah
 jrke: did they resubmitted boss?
 GreatTux: Wood boss to legend :grin:
 Wontonimo: hints for those stuck in Bronze:look at replays of top players in Bronze and count the max number of S3 trees of good players.  Also pay attention to position of seeds.
 Lysk: Zenoscave , referee is now up and running, with c++ the threads are still running when the testing is done (they die within a minute), do you have the same?
 Wontonimo: if you can mimic those two things, you'll probably beat catboss

 Chainman: Any good guides for beam search and simulation. 
 Chainman: I'm at the point where I want to try implementing that, but it's my first time. 
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem">https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem</a>
 Chainman: I was reading that but not sure
 yhyoxx: searching for what exactly&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: a beamsearch for dummies tutorial
 Chainman: basically :sweat_smile:
 UndercoverToad: i don't know about anything specific
 UndercoverToad: try google "beam search java" or any other language
 UndercoverToad: but for this contest beam search is not completely straight forward
 UndercoverToad: if you just chain actions, you get out of sync regarding days
 UndercoverToad: and that will heavily mess with your scoring function
 Marchete: I don't understand the out of sync
 UndercoverToad: the beam has multiple nodes at the bottom layer
 dreadylein: if you just treat waitstate like any other state, states at depth x can have multiple days
 UndercoverToad: say you have WAIT+WAIT, GROW+WAIT, GROW+SEED plans
 UndercoverToad: WAIT ends the day and gives you suns. but it's not a great move
 UndercoverToad: so you should have WAIT, GROW+WAIT and GROW+SEED+WAIT at the same level
 Marchete: ahh I get it
 UndercoverToad: which is totally doable. but something that might challenge you if you code your first even beam
 Marchete: I don't know how to do that :D
 AntiSquid: easy to patch that @_@
 XeroOl: is there a good way to async read in c++?
 UndercoverToad: i just chained some beams after each other
 XeroOl: I'd like to make an ai that can think during the opponent's turn
 UndercoverToad: first beam to completely finish day 1 and just store the final nodes ending in WAIT
 XeroOl: but it looks like non-blocking read from c++ is a pain
 Marchete: XeroOl you can't
 dreadylein: your core is frozen, dont bother&#160;:)
 Marchete: don't waste time on it
 XeroOl: really, it is?
 Marchete: it's called "pondering"
 Marchete: and your bot is frozen on enemy turn
 AntiSquid: that's why there's a tyurn limit
 XeroOl: I didn't know the bot is frozen on enemy turn
 Marchete: so you get like a 10% improvement, at most
 XeroOl: fair enough
 KelvinAndHubbles: Anyone know how high you have to get in silver for gold? Was about 1/3 of bronze got in silver so I'm guessing like top 600?
 UndercoverToad: and i want to turn that into a chokudai but sounds a bit complicated
 Westicles: This is sort of a great contest I think
 XeroOl: that makes this a lot easier lol
 KelvinAndHubbles: (I mean in two days, gold is released now)
 Chainman: chokudai?
 Astrobytes: You might squeeze a couple of ms but not worth it
 Marchete: not at all
 UndercoverToad: chokudai is like beam. but has a fiex depth and dynamic width
 AntiSquid: Chainman the holy grail 
 UndercoverToad: beam has fixed width and just goes deeper as long as there is time
 Marchete: what's the problem with emulating the enemy?
 Chainman: are you sure lol?
 Marchete: like you all try to avoid it at all costs
 AntiSquid: i think chokudai is great, just need good eval 
 Chainman: Cause when I google chokudai, nothing about beam search is result.
 UndercoverToad: the enemy is another topic. I even would need a bit of refactoring to enable it
 Chainman: I googled "chokudai beam search"
 UndercoverToad: and there are just so many possible moves
 UndercoverToad: hard to predict anything
 Marchete: so less without enemy
 AntiSquid: you need VIP membership to access it Chainman, classified info
 Marchete: your GROW+SEED can be a bad move
 Marchete: if enemy SEED first
 GreatTux: beam is straight forward to implement a end of day your eval/scoring function it was matters
 UndercoverToad: the only thing I can think of: when opponent starts cutting trees, you play along to get some nutrients from it
 UndercoverToad: I just accept that and always SEED at the end of the turn
 UndercoverToad: can help to reduce sun costs
 Marchete: SEED at end?
 Marchete: why?
 UndercoverToad: sun cost
 UndercoverToad: you grow the old seeds first
 UndercoverToad: and then you get new ones cheaper
 AntiSquid: what do you have now Chainman&#160;?
 AntiSquid: just strong evals&#160;? 
 UndercoverToad: and again i'm talking too much
 Chainman: :grin:
 Chainman: y'all trolling with chokudai
 Marchete: I'd say the first point on a day
 dGrayCoder: Any tips for switching from Java to Kotlin?
 Astrobytes: It's only a matter of waiting for you to do it toad&#160;:)
 Marchete: is to reorder what 's more economic
 Chainman: I have crappy heuristics, that somehow have me in silver. 
 Chainman: or eval
 Marchete: maybe cut first, then seed, etc..
 Marchete: it depends on count of the current items
 Chainman: I want to improve my heuristics and try simulation (beam search)
 UndercoverToad: when you are barely above 500 lines: no it does not depend
 AntiSquid: i have chokudai implemented, no eval almost Chainman, so no troll, just saying
 Marchete: it doesn't depend?
 UndercoverToad: :zipper_mouth:
 Marchete: ok then
 UndercoverToad: should do that more often
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/profile/chokudai?locale=en">https://codeforces.com/profile/chokudai?locale=en</a>
 Chainman: I mean when I search chokudai search, I get only japanese websites
 UndercoverToad: the search algo is named after him
 jacek: chunchunmaru!
 Chainman: It might exist, but how is there no English resource.
 Counterbalance: Chainman search for chodukaisearch
 AntiSquid: that's the first step on your journey Chainman
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/nQQQa8">https://ideone.com/nQQQa8</a>
 AntiSquid: because he is jap Chainman
 Westicles: teccles might apply here as well
 AntiSquid: what's a tickles? is there an algo named after him? lol
 jacek: tekles?
 UndercoverToad: note: pseudocode has 1 or 2 bugs
 jacek: i only know it for uttt opening
 AntiSquid: that thing is a uTTT specific gimmic where would you apply it here Westicles
 AWOL: Is anyone having issues running the code right now&#160;? I can't see the game and nothing happens when I press play  my code ...
 ddreams: reload the page?
 Westicles: Sorry, I thought the chokudai thing was a troll
 Chainman: lol, same
 AntiSquid: i said it's no troll @_@
 Nerchio: do you guys know how to fix local referee saying you dont output anything?
 Chainman: I see Chokudai is a celebrity in CP.
 Chainman: But there is no english guide for chokudai search lol
 AntiSquid: he isn't english .
 Chainman: Yeah I know
 jacek: hes scottish?
 kreska: AWOL maybe you got timed out when i teseted my code to much i got timed out but i got the notification about it in the top left corner of thje browser
 Chainman: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: his smile looks scottish i guess
 ddreams: typical scottish name
 AntiSquid: ask astro he should know
 Marchete: if you seed at end of turn you are giving the enemy the option to use it first...
 MSmits: and if you seed at the beginning of turn you give your opponent the option to react to your choice
 BrunoFelthes: if you seed at the start of the day, you are giving information on where are you going...
 BrunoFelthes: balance it will be hard&#160;:/
 Marchete: but then the rest of your beam search is useful
 XeroOl: if you seed at the start of the day, you take the spots so the opponent can't
 XeroOl: it's interesting
 Marchete: seeding at the end can end up with a 0 useful beamsearch
 AWOL: kreska thanks, I tried reloading again and it worked that time. 
 AntiSquid: or timeouts
 Chainman: rip
 MSmits: btw, i had a sim bug earlier where i was not properly taking into account two opponents seeding the same spot at the same time
 MSmits: this happened once in about 20 games
 MSmits: so it's not that common
 AntiSquid: two opponents? wow
 Marchete: I have this conditional prepared
 MSmits: two players sorry
 Chainman: It's not that big of issue though 
 AntiSquid: is that how you cimb the ladder? beat 2 at once&#160;?
 Marchete: but I have so many bugs that's not a priority
 Marchete: I still don't have a sim...
 ZarthaxX: are submits slow?
 UndercoverToad: i have 2 already, shall I give you one of them? :D
 RoboStac: faster than promotions 
 UndercoverToad: the OOP version and the bitboard
 AntiSquid: what are you doing Marchete&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: lol UndercoverToad i found a guy named BATTLETOAD
 Marchete: bitboarding
 ZarthaxX: RoboStac but a bit stuck too right?
 UndercoverToad: did that toad beat you?
 RoboStac: yeah, they look to be
 Marchete: but I have many doubts
 Marchete: about what's the best option on many things
 WolfDarrigan: pick one, refactor later :p
 schachmatt: maybe this has already been asked but does anyone else have a frozen "promotion to leage in&#160;: 00h 00m 00s"?
 MSmits: refresg
 MSmits: g=h
 RoboStac: yes, the promotion servers are stuck at the moment, devs are aware
 UndercoverToad: known problem schachmatt, can't reach staff
 Astrobytes: Devs are on it
 UndercoverToad: oh they are?
 schachmatt: gotcha thanks
 RoboStac: well, they've been pinged
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad he didnt sir
 ZarthaxX: but you smash me as always
 Astrobytes: Thibaud said he pinged them, Saiksy gave me eyes
 UndercoverToad: ah
 CouscousAgha: should I consider where the sun is pointing when I wanna seed?
 UndercoverToad: right, I muted the bug report channel too
 ZarthaxX: damn this guy completed everything at the end so funny
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551425387">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551425387</a>
 AntiSquid: bear you around same rank as me
 Astrobytes: Do you have any channel unmuted other than external contest? :D
 UndercoverToad: you got me :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 AntiSquid: he surely has memes unmuted
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid wanna cry together?
 AntiSquid: jajaja 
 ZarthaxX: is that a no&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: i haven't muted the mods channel yet. but the discord bot makes me wonder if i should
 AntiSquid: crying with laughter
 Fluxor: @schachmatt: yes, since almost 3h&#160;:-(
 ZarthaxX: haha :P
 ZarthaxX: like your spanish laugh
 reCurse: Don't want to deal with noise yet here you are on the webchat :thinking:
 UndercoverToad: here i can go away without having the red circle at the top of the tab
 UndercoverToad: and just skip some messages
 AntiSquid: just mute entire server euler
 UndercoverToad: no, #external-contests has some mentions worth considering
 reCurse: Like TopCoder? :imp:
 AntiSquid: some discord server prevent you from turning off announcements though&#160;:(
 reCurse: No sorry wrong site
 reCurse: Which one is the docker one again
 UndercoverToad: hey, I won a tshirt on topcoder at least
 Astrobytes: gocoder
 reCurse: There
 UndercoverToad: in March, still waiting to get contacted
 UndercoverToad: gocoder :door:
 UndercoverToad: but i told sima n about it who then told val growth
 Fallback: If I sell and somebody else seeds that spot on the same turn, does the seed take hold or will the seed be blocked?
 UndercoverToad: who won the $2500
 AntiSquid: you aren't on gocoder discord anymore recurs&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: for me the game itself and the tournament mode had too many red flags
 ddreams: if it's the same turn, neither wins, both trees sleep
 Scarfield: "If both players send a seed to the same place on the same turn, neither seed is planted and the sun points are refunded. The source tree, however, still becomes dormant. "
 AntiSquid: can't even see your messages on there anymore, did you delete? lol
 Fallback: That is for a double seed situation on the same spot but I am asking about one person selling a tree and another trying to seed that tree location on the same turn.
 jacek: Fallback you cant
 UndercoverToad: see whos messages?
 Donald_D._Doge: UndercoverToad, valgrowth won it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://valgrowth.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/05/07/214449">https://valgrowth.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/05/07/214449</a>
 Scarfield: oh, thought you just "misspelled" sell and seed xD
 MSmits: it is an illegal move
 jacek: that cell wont be free when you list legal moves
 UndercoverToad: i know. and dapo 3rd
 Scarfield: simul turns, the cell will not be empty untill next turn
 Fallback: ok thanks all
 reCurse: AntiSquid: I noped out of there pretty fast
 AntiSquid: makes sense
 ashelkov: so sloooow submit
 UndercoverToad: sanity &gt; money
 dGrayCoder: How do you apply graph search in turn based game?
 ddreams: each turn is a node
 Wontonimo: what you mean dGrayCoder?
 reCurse: I'm starting to think very few know how to run programming contests
 reCurse: Even less so adversarial ones
 VizGhar: starting?
 UndercoverToad: halite - dead&#160;:(RAIC - getting better
 reCurse: Fair enough.
 VizGhar: omg recurse is here... run guys
 Wontonimo: oh, that's one way.  another way dGrayCoder and ddreams is that once a player waits, it is constrained to wait till the other player waits
 reCurse: That's not nice&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: CG - not sure if I should finish that sentence
 reCurse: RAIC getting better?
 reCurse: What
 Wontonimo: reCurse, i think he meant your bots are usually very very hard to beat
 Wontonimo: i thought it was a compliment
 dreadylein: i think he dont like you, take your pick :P 
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: "always assume the worst"
 UndercoverToad: still complex games. but the last ones weren't completely borderline over the top
 Scarfield: or how does it go :thinking:
 Chainman: How do I stop chat so I can look above haha
 Wontonimo: plan for the worst, hope for the best&#160;?
 yuyu: What happens when both player do Complete at the same time? They get the same nutrient value and it gets decreased by 2 (unless it is 1 and it decreases to 0)&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: add ?disableChat to the URL Chainman
 Wontonimo: yuyu yes
 Wontonimo: what kind of URL sorcery is this UndercoverToad&#160;?
 reCurse: The HTTP kind
 yuyu: ok thx, wording wasnt very clear
 UndercoverToad: the GET parameter
 reCurse: I'll trust RAIC is getting better when I can make it past the first page of rules.
 Wontonimo: i know that... was just wonder how you discovered that particular parameter
 UndercoverToad: staff mentioned it at some point and used it in their own twitch streams
 Chainman: lol
 Astrobytes: Rules were all on one page last time reCurse. OK, It was a big page, but still! :P
 Chainman: hello World
 Wontonimo: sigh ... being top of bronze just doesn't have the same warm feeling anymore.  (waves fist at "promoting to silver in 00sec")
 reCurse: The RTS game? One page?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. A really long page
 reCurse: Also I lost my taste for reverse engineering games after fantastic bits
 Chainman: disable chat is cool feature, but that's not exactly what I meant :slight_frown:
 UndercoverToad: rules were linked on 1 page
 UndercoverToad: and then you downloaded a 20 pages PDF
 reCurse: Ah that's more like it
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: No they did have a really long rule page too
 Scarfield: PagestrHydes
 UndercoverToad: i still remember 2019 when they described the condition when a unit is standing on a ladder
 Astrobytes: wetrwertewrfieldthing
 AntiSquid: they'll make next one with really small font size, 1 page is 1 page
 Scarfield:&#160;? XD
 UndercoverToad: ladder = rechtangle. the line from the center of the unit to the top must be at least partially inside the rectangle
 Astrobytes: I couldn't think of anything Scarfield&#160;:)
 miszu: do you need to do sims to get to silver? I am kinda lazy to spend 3h for writing the engine + sims
 Scarfield: fair enough, was thinking there was a german joke in there xD
 Ruruthia: definitely not miszu
 Ruruthia: good if-elses are everything xD
 jacek: german joke? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aqn40bv_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aqn40bv_700bwp.webp</a>
 UndercoverToad: &gt; really small font size, 1 page is 1 page
 VaseSimion: @miszu, I got to silver with if-else statements
 miszu: well, everything is an if else statement
 reCurse: The good old 1.5 line spacing
 reCurse: 2 line was too obvious
 jacek: 2 lines
 jacek: meh
 UndercoverToad: no, in hand writing
 reCurse: What were you raised by, barbarians?
 jacek: how can you set font in handwriting?
 UndercoverToad: once i was sitting next to a student who got those extra tasks almost every time
 miszu: but thanks for feedback, I guess I can reach silver in an hour if I am lucky with my thresholds
 UndercoverToad: he was writing complete and utter nonsense
 UndercoverToad: once he passed a paper with a note to a classmate (around 9th grade)
 AntiSquid: import boostrap, does everything for you jacek
 UndercoverToad: teacher saw it and read it out loudly
 UndercoverToad: "say car tut tut"
 ANJACE_Z: than what happened?
 UndercoverToad: class laughed
 ANJACE_Z: haha
 ddreams: mission accomplished
 Wontonimo: hey miszu, what are you basing your logic on?
 AntiSquid: ah we trolled one of the teachers with the paper thing, just wrap multiple messages inside each other and pass on until teacher notices UndercoverToad
 AntiSquid: he read out all of them ... took a while
 UndercoverToad: we called him D√∂ner because he introduced himself wrong in 5th grade, never got rid of the name."my name is D√∂ner and my favorite food is Patrick"
 VaseSimion: Guys, how do high level people approach a game like this? Do you simulate 10 moves ahead and choose the best one (like computer engines)? of are you going recurrent NN?  I am genuinely curious as still entry level developer
 Astrobytes: toad :D
 ddreams: Vase, take a look at older postmortems
 VaseSimion: Where do I find those?
 UndercoverToad: simulating several turns ahead and choosing the best is a good summary
 Wontonimo: hey miszu, i just looked at one of your replays.  if you seed 2 squares away (but not in a straight line) then you'll probably see a HUGE jump in your score
 UndercoverToad: go to the forum and search for "feedback and strategies"
 ddreams: google gives many results too
 VaseSimion: Thanks toad
 VaseSimion: And dream&#160;:)
 miszu: Wontonimo I basically select the 2nd available command
 UndercoverToad: and then go by most upvotes, these are usually the more advanced posts
 Wontonimo: VaseSimion - really depends on the game.
 Sparky610: 5
 itzluku: actions.append((i,mountain_h)) if not mountain_h not in [x[1] for x in actions]
 botbtw33: pepe
 itzluku: what is that not the same as
 itzluku: if mountain_h not in [x[1] for x in actions]:
 Wontonimo: miszu, if that's the case, can you rank the seed commands by how many of your neighbours there are.
 itzluku: why*
 miszu: I notice the seed command is at the end, let me take the 2nd last :D
 Wontonimo: VaseSimion - the popular ones are Beam, Minimax, MonteCarlo and GA.  Not that many NNs, but definitely some killer NNs out there.  
 Marchete: MonteCarlo =&gt; MonteCarlo and MCTS
 Wontonimo: miszu you've got to create your own ranking for each move, then take the move with the best ranking.  For example some moves are really really inefficient with sun points
 miszu: no I get it Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: right Marchete.  
 miszu: it's just I am super lazy and I am at "work"
 VaseSimion: Thanks a lot Wontonimo, I was reading recently on how minmax works and I was looking at monte carlo some long time ago. I feel so far from being a real developer seeing the people here&#160;:)))
 miszu: but thanks for the input
 miszu: my code at work takes an hour to run
 7amasa: is java used by cg, 8 or 9
 reCurse: codingame.com/faq
 Astrobytes: VaseSimion: 'real developer' eh, it's a very niche field making bots for games tbh, it has no reflection on you as a dev
 Marchete: yeah
 cegprakash: catboss is changed?
 Marchete: job development has little in common
 cegprakash: cat boss suddenly 55 points
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes :thumbsup:
 reCurse: Yes it's a bus now
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: That is weird
 VaseSimion: @Astrobytes, I know, I actually am developing embedded C, but seeing the people here doing all these bots makes me feel so basic with my simple loops and registries on a small processot&#160;:))
 Ashbury: Any news on when silver promotion will be fixed&#160;?
 Wontonimo: oh nos, my poor bot is now below catboss suddenly&#160;:(
 Marchete: embedded C?
 Marchete: that's hard :D
 ddreams: really depends on the application
 Astrobytes: You can really use that to your advantage here VaseSimion!
 VaseSimion: Compared to these games that's a walk in the park
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: pretty much any job coding is a piece of cake compared to challenges
 reCurse: lol
 Wontonimo: hey VaseSimion, if it is any consolation it took me about 3 bot battles before i had a library of reusable bot code.  A lot of "senior" people here has lots of reusable experience from previous competitions.
 Marchete: at least what I have at work
 Marchete: it's meh
 Marchete: boring
 cegprakash: catboss if u really dare resubmit and show ur true score
 VaseSimion: I also realized I'm getting better at compatitions, I know they are different but somehow every new one feels more familiar and "easy" somehow. For this one it's really a big help getting the list with possible actions, made my life 10 times easier :D
 Astrobytes: Do you also talk to the bosses in multis ceg?
 Smelty: o.O
 Marchete: cegprakash you weren't higher at leaderboard?
 Marchete: I remember you near my rankings some days ago
 cegprakash: well silver boss came and screwed 
 Smelty: lolol
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: :D
 Astrobytes: The boss has just been reset to 55+ points
 Smelty: hm
 cegprakash: fake score silver boss
 Astrobytes: Ah no, back to normal now
 cegprakash: bronze boss
 cegprakash: bronze boss 55 and rank 2 is 44 points
 Marchete: :D
 jacek: gate keeping eh
 Astrobytes: It should be all good now
 GreatTux: yes silver league! fot fixed for me
 cegprakash: wth promoted in middle of submission
 cegprakash: :P
 GreatTux: thanks for fixing the promotion server @CG 
 Astrobytes: Well, it's a bugfix cegprakash
 Marchete: :D
 ANJACE_Z: guyz this is giving me arithmetic exception:
 ANJACE_Z: timo=(distance[i])/speed;
 Marchete: speed is zero?
 Astrobytes: div by zero?
 ANJACE_Z: no
 Marchete: ahh, then speed is zero
 Astrobytes: lmao
 particleflux: :D
 Marchete: jk check if you have numbers

 Wontonimo: YEAH Finally in Silver
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Dr-D: Congrats! I am happy you are now out of my league&#160;;)
 Tuo: Yes Silver! but battles are running 1 every 2 mins&#160;:(
 Dr-D: Jeah, my last evaluation took ~ 45 min
 Astrobytes: It'll settle down a bit at some point
 VizGhar: just wait 1 week
 Astrobytes: :D
 VizGhar: what? Am I not telling truth?&#160;:)
 VizGhar: so how many players were taken from bronze to silver? 2k?
 Queuebee: when I try to find someone to add as AI to battle, why can't I find some people (even when toggling every field to &lt;all&gt; (atleast, trying to  toggle them to all but they dont seem to stay on what I select, could it be a browser issue?))
 Astrobytes: lol, you speak the truth.But things should speed up again in the next few hours.
 Scarfield: its limited to the top 1000 of your league, or something like that Queuebee
 Astrobytes: ^that
 Queuebee: ah, that explains
 VizGhar: so how many players were taken from bronze to silver? 2k?
 FatIvan: If you want someone lower you can grab one of the games when you submit to the arena but hard to find someone specific.
 Queuebee: time to whip out the ol' random.choice(possible_actions)
 miszu: what's an easy way to check if a string starts with certain words?
 miszu: in c++
 particleflux: strpos
 VizGhar: find
 miszu: i want to take the string for actions and break it down quickly so I can use to find berst move
 Scarfield: from the input?
 miszu: yeah
 Scarfield: just check the first letter
 miszu: so like I can break into datastructure quickly
 Astrobytes: stringstream and tokenize
 Astrobytes:  it
 Astrobytes: using space as a delimiter
 CameronWatt: dangit
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: How do I tag people in the chat? 
 Scarfield: you can ping by mentioning their name xxk1ng0fh3artzxx
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: So, just by typing their name, like Scarfield, it'll automatically ping them? 
 Scarfield: yup, my message was red only for you, your message only red for me
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: Oh! Okay, that's genius. Thank you!
 Scarfield: you can also autocomplete: sca -&gt; tab
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: Scarfield &lt;-- That's awesome!
 Scarfield: i am arent I
 Scarfield: xD
 xxk1ng0fh3artzxx: :heart_eyes:
 miszu: let's say your best move is to plant a seed, the best seed is the one with the most rich richness place?
 Scarfield: depends on shadows from other trees, but simply put i guess so
 miszu: do shadow matter a lot?
 miszu: in term of performance
 Scarfield: no idea, i still havent finished my sim
 Queuebee: S -&gt;tab -&gt; you're now coding Csomething
 VizGhar: this is much nicer then iterating through some objects:result.dormantTrees = 0ULL;
 Wontonimo: miszu I currently don't take shadows into account directly.  indirectly my bot doesn't seed into a straight line from the seeding tree.
 Wontonimo: and that is placing me somewhere around 300-400th in silver
 miszu: Wontonimo what if the only seed you can place in a green are is a straight line?
 miszu: area*
 miszu: btw anyone figure out a mathematical formula that calculates distance between 2 index?
 Wontonimo: then i don't place it.  obviously my bot has many blind spots and i'm not suggesting it is the ultimate bot.  I do plan on replacing it with a sim.
 VizGhar: I'm picking those places that have highest probability to not be covered in shadow (counting trees in all directions) and I'm 150
 CouscousAgha: if a neighbor cell is not in the forest what's its id?
 VizGhar: still shitty, but...
 miszu: like if I give you index 2 and 21, what's the distance
 VizGhar: miszu 2... why?
 miszu: anyone found a formula for general case
 Marchete: precalc all at turn 0
 VizGhar: not 100% sure what you mean
 miszu: I want to avoid precalc haha
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java</a>
 miszu: VizGhar basically this function:
 WolfDarrigan: Sweet, only takes 15 minutes for my bot to search to a depth of 4 days.
 Marchete: then try to play at CubeCoord distances
 miszu: genious
 Marchete: but you can't directly
 VizGhar: I have them precalculated as well... 1 array on single line
 miszu: what's z?
 Marchete: you need to keep that CubeCoord for each coordinate
 Marchete: then you can calc distances
 miszu: so complex
 Marchete: in CubeCoord
 Marchete: it is
 VizGhar: miszu then precalculate :D
 miszu: I want to precalculate lol
 Marchete: int distance(index i, index i2) ---&gt; distance[i,i2]
 Marchete: on a matriz
 Marchete: matrix
 WolfDarrigan: Miszu <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/</a>
 VizGhar: U using that Marchete?
 miszu: man coordinates in a hex is something...
 King_Coda: Hontoni
 VizGhar: you dont have to use them at all
 Marchete: I've used it in my heuristic bot, yes
 Marchete: to calculate neighbours at distance 2 and 3
 icecream17: oh, 2073 made it to silver? i might make it to gold then
 Marchete: on bitboard/sim, nope
 itzluku: guys whats tehr am limitation again?
 itzluku: the ram*
 Astrobytes: 768mb
 Astrobytes: it's on the faq page
 AntiSquid: bitboard simplifies life a lot.
 AntiSquid: ladder games are very slow o.q
 miszu: ok I get the cube coordinates
 iconic-coder: i am stuck
 miszu: basically 3 axis for 2 diagnoals and last for horizontal
 miszu: you could do a map from index to x,y,z coordinates
 MuhammadIdham: I am just trying enter this web, suddenly dificult test
 miszu: and then calculating distances is just taking a diff of x y and z
 miszu: dividing by 2
 struct: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 miszu: ‚î¨‚îÄ‚î¨„Éé( ¬∫ _ ¬∫„Éé) bruuh
 particleflux: lol, silver for my quick n dirty bash bot
 LADYSMAN905: Hi im JUstin and im new can i get help on "the Desent"
 miszu: coding coordinates system took me 15 min
 miszu: pretty neat
 Lysk: brutaltester finishing with all bot threads still hanging = pc :skull:
 struct: windows?
 Lysk: ubuntu
 struct: hmm I havent had problems with brutaltester on my wsl ubuntu machine 
 Lysk: bot threads are dying after exactly 1 minute of existence
 struct: ah
 struct: referee times out due to timelimit
 Lysk: which timeout am I looking at here?
 struct: you are using zeno referee right?
 Lysk: yes
 struct: What I did was write my own referee&#160;:/
 struct: But I did it before the contest
 struct: When I had no access to the referee
 struct: I dont know any easy fix to that
 struct: SDK has limit of time for games
 Lysk: I tried to add something in my bot (if last day and order=wait then return) to no avail
 struct: if you only print wait
 struct: does it still timeout?
 Lysk: let me check
 Nerchio: official referee times out for me on round 1
 Nerchio: rest is fine
 Nerchio: i just set longer round 1 couldnt care  less not sure if this is the problem you have
 cegprakash: anyone in silver top 300 with depth of 1 (ours + opp)
 struct: I would share my referee but it has the bitboard implementation I use
 Lysk: I have kind of the opposite of a timeout, after running 10 games and getting results about winrate, all the processes 10 games x 2 bots are still running
 Lysk: they die automatically after being 1 minute old
 Counterbalance: I have if (! cin.good() ) break as the while condition and afer reading the turn input, maybe that'll help?
 ddreams: yes
 Lysk: &gt; printing "WAIT" at the end does change the outcome
 Lysk: Counterbalance I'll try
 ddreams: I put cin.good() inside and after the possibleactions loop 
 ddreams: sometimes the number of possible actions was billions, so it got stuck there
 miszu: in c++, easiest way to access the 2nd and 3rd word of a string?
 ddreams: I'd say either scanf or stringstream
 Astrobytes: miszu I answered this earlier: stringstream and tokenize based on space as a delimiter
 miszu: ok thanks Astrobytes
 miszu: and ddreams
 Counterbalance: doesn't cin &gt;&gt; command; if (command == "SEED") cin &gt;&gt; from &gt;&gt; to; do the trick?
 ddreams: yes
 ddreams: but not if you have a string and not cin
 miszu: that's even better
 miszu: using cin
 Lysk: no luck with `cin.good()` either, maybe I should look in how bot processes are killed?
 Lysk: thanks for the help though, I appreciate&#160;:)
 ddreams: did you put them where I said, Lysk?
 Lysk: I have one after reading the "possible moves", you have one earlier right?
 ddreams: you need it inside the loop
 Lysk: oh I haven't check inside that loop
 Counterbalance: preferrably after reading first input line
 ddreams: that should work best, actually
 Counterbalance: it's only then that the iostream knows there's an eof
 Lysk: let me try after each input!
 ddreams: I had the same problem and fixed it by checking in the loop, but after the first read should be sufficient
 Lysk: that would be the "day" read
 Counterbalance: are you using a 'recent' brutaltester?   (i'm using the one from 30 jul 2018)
 ddreams: yes
 Lysk: Yes, I think I downloaded it during last fall challeng
 ddreams: compiled it from source now
 Counterbalance: you could try the cli branch on my fork of the referee as a last resort
 AntiSquid: you don't get all possible moves in game do you&#160;? i have level 3 trees, i get all sedable areas but no COMPLETE commands ...
 ddreams: not enough sun?
 Lysk: Not enough sunpoints maybe?
 AntiSquid: oh
 ddreams: you do get all the moves
 AntiSquid: right .
 AntiSquid: fk too many tiny details ...
 ddreams: my first bot verified that I generated the same as the input
 Counterbalance: struct does your referee generate the same board as the official one for the same seed?
 struct: no
 struct: I did it before the official referee was available
 AntiSquid: how early on did you join the testing struct&#160;? 
 Counterbalance: allright.. I don't think it's possible as it depends on the JRE version
 struct: 14-20 days before I think
 Lysk: no luck with `cin.good` I had a kill switch after each input, same thing
 AntiSquid: you couldn't change anything about the game if you didn't like it could you&#160;?
 ddreams: how do you use the cin.good though?
 struct: I couldnt make drastic changes
 AntiSquid: or give feedback to change certain rules 
 AntiSquid: ya ok
 Marchete: turns with 72 moves :S
 Marchete: possible moves
 struct: Would be a good thing to have strong players to test these games
 struct: But with so few contests I dont see anyone joining testing
 cegprakash: omg ppl deplete the nutrients so fast
 miszu: you can use my bot struct
 struct: I only joined because I have no chance for top 20
 Lysk: I had `if(!cin.good()){kill=true;return;}` to get out of the read function, then in the main loop `if(kill){break[}`
 Marchete: thanks for your time testing it&#160;:)
 Marchete: no bugs for now, right?
 struct: There were
 struct: Even after release
 ddreams: strange, that worked for me, perhaps your bots get stuck elsewhere
 ddreams: attach a debugger and see?
 Counterbalance: Lysk I'm running the cli branch of my fork of the referee on AdoptOpenJDK 1.8, no issues (on windows though)
 struct: There was a bug where a player that timed out could win
 AlexAnselmo: My time to shine!
 Lysk: ddreams yeah it's weird at least I have an idea where to look for, thanks!
 struct: if his total suns + -1 &gt; opponent current score
 Lysk: Counterbalance, I just built yours
 Marchete: ohh
 Marchete: nice
 struct: I didnt find it&#160;:(
 Marchete: so if you timeout early you won
 struct: yes
 Marchete: hahaha
 AliMourtada: try{
 AliMourtada: to
 Lysk: ha the dreaded no main maniest
 Lysk: *manifest
 Lysk: wrong branch probably
 Counterbalance: java -jar target/*-shaded.jar
 Lysk:&#160;:+1:
 Marchete: well, I calculated possible moves, getting the same as CG
 Marchete: at least 1 game
 struct: :D
 ddreams: it's a good thing to verify, I found a bug that way
 struct: I tested for 5k games during testing
 ddreams: made it suicide if it didn't match
 miszu: what would be considered as the best grow command?
 Astrobytes: grow treeCellIndex
 ddreams: when my trees grow, and not yours
 miszu: no but like, I am doing basic strats
 miszu: I coded the best seed
 miszu: which is best richness and furthest away
 miszu: now it's the growing part
 miszu: I guess most richness and biggest size?
 AlexAnselmo: Grow the ones you think will shadow theirs and won't be shadowed.
 ddreams: most sun
 miszu: I don't take opponents yet
 itzluku: did anyone reach death 3&#160;?
 itzluku: depth* 3 xD
 Astrobytes: I'm on Death 5
 Smelty: nope, just have scoring system
 miszu: thing is you need to adjust your heuristics based on # of turns
 miszu: because strats changes once you reach endgame
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: true
 itzluku: u dont even have 6byte per state
 itzluku: wtf
 Astrobytes: who doesn't have 6 bytes per state?
 Queuebee: I have only 4 :worried:
 Marchete: 6 bytes per state?
 struct: my state is 96
 Marchete: I have more like 95
 Marchete: + movelist
 Smelty: hmms
 Astrobytes: I have no idea what they're talking about with 6 bytes
 Smelty: [y] same
 RoboStac: sounds like a msmits implementation
 Astrobytes: lol
 RoboStac: every bit must be used and probably used multiple times
 Marchete: and 3 bits free to pack another 18 games inside
 icecream17: ...wow my state representation must be really inefficient
 Queuebee: me neither I have  14 ints , 2int[37], 3 bool[37] 3 List&lt;Idontevenknow&gt; its a mess
 Astrobytes: Yes. Bit reuse - during the sim - then restored.
 struct: My state is currently 1MB
 struct: help 
 Marchete: :rofl:
 Marchete: you have 760 states
 miszu: what are you storing?!?
 icecream17: I have a class `game` with multiple `rounds`
 Marchete: mine is work in progress
 Marchete: so it's a draft
 struct: I wont go lower than what I currently have
 Astrobytes: I still didn't finish my sim
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/520bc47a-2c0c-485f-a0dd-d51d50b5af5a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/520bc47a-2c0c-485f-a0dd-d51d50b5af5a</a>
 struct: I doubt performance is important
 icecream17: game stores 2 players, another copy of two players, 37 cells, and a list of rounds
 Marchete: ugly C# is ugly
 Astrobytes: I'm still less than motivated :D
 Marchete: why not struct?
 icecream17: round stores ....5 numbers, 4 arrays
 Astrobytes: wtf MArchete
 AntiSquid: what's that about adding and remove bits during sim @_@ i thought fixed state is best and then just run checks
 struct: oh no marchete using avx 
 Astrobytes: get that code out my eyes
 Marchete: not really useful
 Marchete: I tried
 Marchete: but meh
 struct: I just feel like it isnt important, I could be wrong though
 AntiSquid: thanks marchete, it's good to cross reference stuff
 Marchete: this stuff generates moves correctly
 Marchete: it does shadow calc too
 Marchete: but I need to test on real states
 Astrobytes: Once, you said.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: twice
 Marchete: :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Marchete: I need to pack all classes
 Marchete: and test in IDE
 AntiSquid: wait does it all need to be uint and such&#160;?
 Marchete: also it's not for C&amp;P damn
 Marchete: it's just as a reference

 Smelty: just doubled my length of code....."yay"
 dreadylein: @Marchete check Msmiths bot atm, he is using the Say function for sim checks, its quick and dirty... i like it :D 
 Marchete: what Say?
 Marchete: I need a good way to check
 AntiSquid: "Sim perfect" all he says
 Marchete: probably as usual
 dreadylein: the last parm of the output
 Marchete: play against itself and validate all
 dreadylein: if you spam fails there its easy to check if you dont hae tooling for it
 struct: msmits expand all possible states and check if any of them matches next state
 AntiSquid: message, dreadylein
 struct: that he erad
 struct: that he read*
 Smelty: interesting game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551581856">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/551581856</a>
 dreadylein: @antiSquid :D 
 struct: I played vs myself to check
 Smelty: i plant to the outside for somer eason
 dreadylein: thats the word that was missing&#160;;)
 Marchete: play with predefined moves
 Goulstem: Hello, world!
 Marchete: I always do that
 struct: not predefined
 Smelty: hello, goul
 struct: ok its predefined
 Marchete: ahh
 Goulstem: :grin:
 struct: it uses xor rand
 Marchete: it's not possible to calc sun in most cases
 struct: but is constant
 Marchete: if you are waiting
 struct: true
 Marchete: you can't know the whole state
 Marchete: in fact
 Marchete: I can't detect endgame right now
 RoboStac: yeah, if you wait you just don't check the next turn as there is no way to be correct
 dreadylein: yep, i just did exhaustive depth 1 and checked if gamehash in the next turn was in my list
 RoboStac: unless the opponent was already waiting
 struct: thats what I did yeah
 Marchete: if you control both players it's possible
 struct: vs the same version is the perfect way
 Marchete: so I'll go this way
 Marchete: well, tomorrow we'll see, gn!
 struct: gn
 AntiSquid: day &gt; 23  (end game) @_@ what do you mean you can't detect?
 AntiSquid: gn8
 Marchete: you never have day 23 at inputs
 struct: thats not what he meant by end game
 Marchete: day 24
 Marchete: you can have N turns at day 23
 Marchete: and if you can't play
 Marchete: you don't know the real endgame
 AntiSquid:  Sims: 61187 Completed: 22263 Remaining: 38932
 AntiSquid: ignore the count, it's a little bit bugged
 AntiSquid: and yes my eval is garbage
 zenwraight: when do we get promoted to next league&#160;? 
 zenwraight: like I am in bronze now, do we need to be in some rank range to be promoted to next league / 
 RoboStac: if you are bronze you should be able to see the boss - you need to be ranked above it
 RoboStac: I think it's called catboss?
 zenwraight: got it ya i can see it
 zenwraight: makes sense
 ddreams: bitboard time, I guess... perhaps more speed will make up for my lack of heuristic smartness
 AntiSquid: you're doing well ddreams
 ddreams: thanks, hopefully I can improve further
 Smelty: ooh
 Wontonimo: more speed is always good.
 Westicles: Spring Challenge 2021 (temporary upload):  Did a Cat get this through some devious API thingee?
 Wontonimo: ddreams, did you compete on UTTT?
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: that depends how many days you've been awake
 Wontonimo: lol Astrobytes
 Wontonimo: gotta rest at least 1:3 days
 Smelty: hi?
 Wontonimo: hi Smelty&#160;?
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: just taught my trees to not stand in a line
 Smelty: didn't really improve ranking but oh well
 Wontonimo: yeah, jungle warfare works better in this game
 Smelty: yes.
 Smelty: they stil seem to plant in a line occasionally though
 Smelty: weird;
 Astrobytes: TF. I'm sitting here in full camo and it's nto helping.
 Astrobytes: *not
 Smelty: where'd astro go
 Smelty: can't see him
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 icecream17: Ok, I now spam trees if my resulting points &gt; opponent doesnt do anything for this turn, and gets Infinity trees on 0 nutrient ground
 icecream17: *on the turns afterward
 icecream17: oof, i won 6/10
 icecream17: oh no, I still spam trees even if I don't have enough sun
 icecream17: It's taking quite a while to play battles
 icecream17: 261 out of 2148 computing
 reCurse: It only gets decent at 100 and less or so
 reCurse: Limiting plays didn't help, who would have thought
 reCurse: :P
 CouscousAgha: my new bot beats my old one, but my old one wins more games in the arena?
 CouscousAgha: this is the funniest thing I witnessed today
 casmith789: maybe it's just good against your bot but not against bots in general
 CouscousAgha: yeah I adjusted the new one according to the weaknesses of the old one
 CouscousAgha: but something about all of this is funny to me lol
 reCurse: You haven't lived until you fixed a bug and dropped 400 ranks
 AntiSquid: 800
 AntiSquid: or i thought i had
 icecream17: i lost by 2 trees <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/551610512">https://www.codingame.com/replay/551610512</a>
 Ard1998: auch. thats a really tight match
 icecream17: i already fixed a bug where trees were being spammed when i dint have enough sun, and I won 132 to 111. should I submit again
 Ard1998: probably. i know my code is bad but somehouw im consistant top 20 in bronze and the only thing keeping me awake is me wanting to see promotion
 Astrobytes: I'm still looking for reasons as to why everybody seems to find this game so fun and interesting?
 Ard1998: competition
 RoboStac: you could have got the draw there icecream17
 Nerchio: well do you like other more classic board games?
 AntiSquid: i don't Astrobytes, it's just contest time
 Astrobytes: Of course Nerchio.
 Nerchio: so whats so wrong with this one idk
 AntiSquid: i really hate this board game . will avoid in real life for sure
 Astrobytes: I just find it unbelievably boring! It's purely my opinion
 Nerchio: haha lol
 Nerchio: haters
 Astrobytes: I cannot get excited about it at all
 Astrobytes: Not hating at all. I just wonder what people get out of it.
 AntiSquid: i am more excited about my code 
 AntiSquid: i am trying some ideas, well tried, now i just want to see if i can finally find the magic heuristics .
 BlitzProg: the feeling of validation from having an AI that outperforms other competitors
 AntiSquid: ya that's it
 Astrobytes: That's independent of the actual game though
 AntiSquid: as i said i hate the game so ...
 icecream17: that reminds me
 AntiSquid: it's not the game that keeps me here
 icecream17: i made up a very arbitrary game called "tic tac toe grow"
 Astrobytes: Well. To put it in context, I love competition but why play a game you hate?
 AntiSquid: other contests require more fuss for setup and getting used to the starter ... cg is more convinient 
 Astrobytes: *strongly dislike
 XeroOl: I just wrote my first mcts implementation
 XeroOl: for ultimate tic tac toe
 XeroOl: I'm just watching my bot go straight from bronze to legend
 Nerchio: you only get these twice a year
 Nerchio: i guess its kinda fun
 AntiSquid: ya
 Nerchio: personally i dont enjoy grinding dead multies
 Nerchio: i sometimes do but usually not
 AntiSquid: when else is the community active&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I prefer live comps too
 XeroOl: I just don't know how to go about making a search
 Astrobytes: But, if I don't like it then I won't.
 XeroOl: and the spring challenge game is not fun to hardcode
 Astrobytes: And Nerchio, who grinds dead multis? Grinding the community contribs is far better.
 reCurse: Hey, I spent more time grinding dead multis than on contests
 AntiSquid: well what are you up to astro&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm not here judging anyones preferences, was just wondering about what everyone likes about the contest
 XeroOl: if you're grinding the multis, are they really dead&#160;??&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i mean what do you keep yourself busy with
 Nerchio: Astrobytes i missed many multies in the past I assume they are better in average than contribs
 Astrobytes: Currently getting a job AntiSquid
 reCurse: Some of the most popular multis (GitC, C4L), I hate with a passion.
 reCurse: Different tastes, Astrobytes...
 Nerchio: and don't really have time to sort through valuable contribs :D
 Astrobytes: I can't get on with C4L at all
 AntiSquid: do you like this contest reCurse&#160;?
 AntiSquid: the game itself .
 reCurse: For the sake of clarity I ignore contest related questions until further notice
 Astrobytes: Heh heh heh
 Nerchio: its emil again
 AntiSquid: :thinking: what's the best way i could misinterpret that?
 reCurse: The whole point is to be non-committal whenever I want, so I have to play along regardless of if I actually participate
 Astrobytes: Am I wrong in saying it lacks any real depth?
 Westicles: This one seems better than usual for the dumb guys who can't write sims in 20 minutes
 cegprakash: top 8 guys at a whoomping lead in silver
 XeroOl: @westicles, writing a sim isn't the hard part
 XeroOl: the hard part is writing a fast sim
 AntiSquid: i might be wrong, but you need good sim and good heuristics for this one
 Westicles: Yeah, but even the eval only guys are getting up to, what 100-200?
 reCurse: 4 points spread in top 10, I would say enough depth so far Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: they got good early start i guess
 Astrobytes: And a lot of patience for watching replays of a soporific nature
 reCurse: I'd start getting worried at 1
 XeroOl: yeah I feel like you could just hardcode a strategy for this and get really far
 Nerchio: I also thought it was too simple but now i have no idea what im supposed to be doing
 XeroOl: the whole simultaneous moves thing means I don't know how to search it
 icecream17: i remember someone said they got top 10 with hueristics, but i don't remember who... it was like yesterday
 Astrobytes: reCurse: I don't think it'll go much further than that tbh unless some magic meta emerges
 cegprakash: one streamer actually tried surrounding strat and ended up in top 200
 icecream17: surrounding strat?
 cegprakash: capture corners
 AntiSquid: lol
 cegprakash: no sunlight enters inside
 AntiSquid: that sounds funny .
 icecream17: wow genius
 XeroOl: I imagine there's a during-day turn order meta that nobody's explored yet
 XeroOl: unless people have spotted that already
 Astrobytes: Meh. I just don't like the game as I said (imo), I find it completely uninteresting :D So don't mind my cantankerous meanderings too much
 AntiSquid: you are more vocal than me about it :P
 XeroOl: yeah I don't vibe with this game too much
 Nerchio: asd
 Nerchio: for now the meta is make big trees and chop them down
 XeroOl: it looks interesting for the people who enjoy it
 XeroOl: it's just draining for me to stay heuristicing
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm not knocking it at all
 icecream17: maybe if there was time travel, send trees back in time, but it costs sun....
 icecream17: just idea
 cegprakash: well no fog of war and no tracking enemy and no physics.. well I like it 100 times more than last 3 contests for these reasons
 Astrobytes: hehehe, I'll give you that one cegprakash :D
 Wontonimo: icecream17 it was Oioi who was N1 and heuristic only
 AntiSquid: i'd rather play mean max with fog of war right now 
 Wontonimo: outch AntiSquid!
 cegprakash: time travel to start of spring challenge spending real money icecream17
 reCurse: Lots of energy put into not knocking something
 reCurse: :P
 Astrobytes: aw shush you
 Astrobytes: :D
 Nerchio: also Astrobytes i think we should get used to events being a copy of existing board games 
 XeroOl: not knocking something is a time consuming hobby
 XeroOl: you gotta put energy into it
 icecream17: ugh, ceg somehow harvested 11 trees. how can I compete with that
 AntiSquid: pacman was great in hindsight
 Astrobytes: I don't mind that at all Nerchio, I love board games. I just don't like this one.
 struct: I hope not Nerchio
 Wontonimo: so, what happens when gold opens?  do they do the same thing, pick a bot at about 50% mark in Silver and make that the Boss?
 Astrobytes: Noooooo AntiSquid. No it was not.
 struct: Might aswell just make amazons a contest
 icecream17: btw, who's the bronze boss?
 Nerchio: Im just seeing a pattern lately and I think thats what we can expect but i would like to be wrong
 reCurse: Pacman is the reason why you copy board games
 Astrobytes: ^
 cegprakash: anyone else trying minimax or just me? :P
 AntiSquid: this game makes me miss pacman .
 XeroOl: what happened with pacman?
 struct: well they have moved away from games like fb/csb a long time ago
 struct: So I guess its this from now on
 Astrobytes: Did think about it ceg, but probably in combination with another algo
 AntiSquid: they can return anytime struct
 Astrobytes: Only in semi-privates. Gotta cater to the demographic that matters.
 Astrobytes: It's sensible in a way.
 AntiSquid: how about something like a Mean(Max) (Ghost)Busters&#160;? :D
 Astrobytes: Get that ghostbuster game outta my sight :P
 icecream17: 5d chess with time travel
 Astrobytes: Anyway, out for tonight, gn all
 AntiSquid: gn
 King_Coda: gn astro
 Astrobytes: Also, nice to see you reCurse
 RoboStac: oh god can you imagine the chat about the statement if they did 5d chess
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: questions every second message
 Westicles: that reminds me, JBM still owes us 5D Chests stream part 2
 Astrobytes: yeah, I can imagine 
 reCurse: Thanks
 reCurse: Nice to see you too
 icecream17: i wonder what's the most complicated game
 icecream17: *contest
 AntiSquid: OOC
 reCurse: botg
 cegprakash: fantastic bits
 struct: on fb you can tell easily whats hapening
 struct: sim might be hard
 gamerboy15: yo guys
 gamerboy15: hi
 cegprakash: botg ppl hide inside bushes I hate that
 cegprakash: wantonly iron man hits the neutral and neutral comes to me
 cegprakash: crappy lame strats
 AntiSquid: botg go with a meta, you can ignore quite a lot of the bits of info 
 icecream17: ok, i just opened botg
 miszu: oh wow, did a small fix in my bot and it beats the CatBoss
 AntiSquid: you rock miszu
 miszu: ok so won 4 out of 10 times
 miszu: sigh
 miszu: when you lose by 1 tree
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/551652403">https://www.codingame.com/replay/551652403</a>
 icecream17: that's the world record
 struct: who had the ideas for botg?
 AntiSquid: the team :D
 miszu: I'll try my luck in arena
 mainman: I have only join this site a week or two ago! this is so awesome, I enjoy programming so this makes even even more fun to put practice
 cegprakash: ppl improve super fast in Silver
 miszu: well silver is currently like a legend
 ZVRKK: It's really hard to maintain the same position&#160;:/
 mainman: started the Ghost in shell yesterday so I could practice before joining the community tournament 
 AntiSquid: the contest started last week only lasts until next monday morning mainman
 AntiSquid: also completely different games
 mainman: yeah, would need to up my skills before the next tournament
 AntiSquid: just play this one
 AntiSquid: watch some streams
 Wontonimo: just join this one tournament.  it's not like you will lose money or something
 mainman: yeah that's true
 XeroOl: there's no harm in doing the live one
 AntiSquid: don't be shy lol
 icecream17: there's 0 streams...
 XeroOl: except the fact that it's a hard game to search
 mainman: can you still continue after it ends?
 XeroOl: I am a one trick pony and I only know MCTS
 AntiSquid: yes
 icecream17: y
 ZVRKK: Totally agree just try, it's fun  !
 Wontonimo: also mainman , i've heard that a live contest like this is way easier to get a high ranking in than the other older competitions.
 XeroOl: ^ yeah, because it's only been out for a couple days
 XeroOl: so there's not write-ups describing optimal strategies
 XeroOl: or people taking months to perfect their bots
 itzluku: so 
 mainman: made it to bronze in ghost in shell, fairly simple game but takes time to map out the functions and some strategy
 Nerchio: nice mainman good start
 itzluku: if u pre filter some choices u could simulate the game in maybe depth 5&#160;?
 icecream17: people take months? wow
 Wontonimo: yeah, i played UTTT for 1 month, including a week off of work
 Wontonimo: uttt = Ultimate TicTacToe
 icecream17: i know, i'm in the contest
 daniserrano7: I guess there are less people in spring challenge than in regular challenge due to time
 rafaelSorel: Wontonimo, took the time to write to write those fancy sentences while playing :D
 XeroOl: @wontonimo I just submitted my bot for UTTT and I'm watching it go from bronze up to legend
 daniserrano7: I made to silver in spring challenge pretty easy, but strugle in bronze in ghost in the cell
 miszu: so many people are going to silver
 mainman: thanks Ice, that's encouraging 
 miszu: 13 people at least
 XeroOl: I'm just doing vanilla MCTS with no heuristics
 ZVRKK: Everyone is talking about simulations and complexe algo and i'am here with my if /else statements :joy:
 XeroOl: lmao @ZVRKK that's where I'm at in the spring challenge
 annaproxy: vanilla MCTS gang
 XeroOl: I somehow got into silver in the spring challenge with just if statements
 XeroOl: and heuristics
 XeroOl: no simulation at all
 XeroOl: no shadow code at all
 mainman: lol @ZVRKK that's me&#160;:)
 daniserrano7: me too
 ZVRKK: Same only if/else and got to around 500 silver
 daniserrano7: I'd like to get into genetich algos but that seems to hard for me
 alchemsti: if/else but with shading calculation?
 ZVRKK: Same i'm too noob for now (my first compet)
 mybk: isn't too easy to enter silver league this time (current contest)
 ZVRKK: alchemsti without shadow calculation for now
 XeroOl: getting out of wood into bronze is just choosing action[1]
 itzluku: i have 134 if
 itzluku: xD
 XeroOl: I don't know how hard it is to get into silver because I was in silver the moment it was created
 ZVRKK: itzluku really&#160;? 
 herrmann: MCTS gang too, but still late to the party
 actualCoderTrevor: I find GA to be pretty easy (easier than searching) but I haven't heard anyone saying they're using them. I think with this contest the challenge would be making sure your bot is doing valid moves
 alchemsti: Wow! I'm doing a pretty simple shadowing, but only ending up at the same place. That suggest my non-shading could improve a lot ZVRKK
 XeroOl: @herrmann MCTS for spring challenge?
 XeroOl: how does that work?
 herrmann: It's a tree search too
 XeroOl: lmao puns
 XeroOl: I guess
 XeroOl: I just don't know how mcts works for simultaneous actions
 XeroOl: by you and your opponent
 struct: it doesnt
 Wontonimo: herrmann , how many playouts per turn are you able to simulate?
 struct: specially here
 XeroOl: I do understand how it works for out-of-order turns
 XeroOl: but I don't think mcts works like that
 herrmann: I'll try implementing plain UCT and seeing how it goes.. anyone got a clue about the approximate rank that  strategy pushes someone up to?
 XeroOl: I think it depends on the details
 Wontonimo: XeroOl , you can implement MCTS to have 2 trees, one for you and one for your opponent.  
 herrmann: Wontonimo, still implementing game logic
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 XeroOl: @wontonimo there's interaction if both players try to plant on the same tile
 daniserrano7: how many score points do you need will be needed to reach gold league?
 XeroOl: I don't think you can just do two trees
 XeroOl: that's just wrong
 Wontonimo: XeroOl how would that be a problem?
 ZVRKK: What's the best type of algorithm to use in this type of game&#160;?
 herrmann: No, plain UCT would need a single tree with the product of both player actions (a huge ramification factor)
 Wontonimo: XeroOl - take a look at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax</a> 
 mybk: Wontonimo, hi, can explain the two tree strategy, 
 herrmann: I'll consider my actions only at first and see what happens... not actually in the challenge after a high rank
 Wontonimo: mybk , are you saying you'll explain the 2 tree strategy or are you asking me to?  I'd be happy to
 mybk: asking you :p 
 Wontonimo: okay, cool.  Let's start with a 1 tree MCTS but with a twist, it plays against a really really fast human.
 mybk: how can you have a tree for you and a tree for your opponent and chose the best action for you 
 KelvinAndHubbles: by making two trees
 Wontonimo: we can imagine that it would find a playout that is good, right?  I mean, that's what MCTS is good at
 mybk: yes
 Wontonimo: okay, now hear me out ... what if ... that second player was MCTS also&#160;!
 Wontonimo: :O
 XeroOl: the two players interact
 XeroOl: you can't just have two separate MCTS things that ignore opponent moves
 mybk: yes and he will give you he's best action 
 ZVRKK: But how can you tell which move is the best&#160;?
 XeroOl: yeah, that's usually done with one MCTS
 miszu: silver bitches!
 XeroOl: but with nodes for different players
 Wontonimo: how that would work with this game, i don't know yet.  i've got it to work with the pacman game
 XeroOl: I don't understand having two trees
 XeroOl: that's just crazy
 struct: it works better when opponent actions dont affect your actions
 struct: In this game I think its not even worth to think about it
 XeroOl: if the opponents actions don't affect yours, there's not really a point in doing a MCTS for themn
 struct: no
 XeroOl: you can just ignore them instead of wasting half your processing power
 PatrickMcGinnisII: acorn bounce affects everything
 struct: I mean dont affect your future possible actions
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476</a>
 herrmann: Exactly... having independent trees would give a goo opponent action but considering plays never interact. It's a different game... can be useful, but it remains to be seen if it's better to spend computation on your tree or half of it on an opponent alone in a different board
 Nerchio: euler 2nd very nice&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ a few top players have showed up, i think we're missing a bunch
 struct: ok i have to start coding
 Wontonimo: yeah, i was thinking the same struct
 struct: I havent really coded since the start...
 struct: only a few lines
 Wontonimo: i have more than a few lines, but not much too it really.
 cegprakash: I haven't coded - Ranks 229 Silver
 struct: i tested the contest
 struct: this bot is from that time
 cegprakash: nice tester
 cegprakash: no bugs
 struct: there were bugs
 cegprakash: bad tester
 struct: true
 herrmann: :joy:
 miszu: how you guys are top 1000. I barely made it to silver
 mainman: just doing a bit of reading regarding MTCS, how would you  set it up between different games, if it is machine learning shouldn't it learn from previous games and then modify actions in the next game?
 Nerchio: mcts is not machine learning
 Nerchio: pls stop
 mainman: :joy:
 Smelty: o.O
 miszu: it's reinforcment learning
 mainman: Reinforcement Learning, ok cool
 miszu: big difference young padawan
 Smelty: yes master
 mainman: that's my misconception , sorry&#160;:)
 miszu: coding I shall return to
 Nerchio: its not reinforcement learning either
 miszu: yeah it is
 Smelty: nay, it is none of the above
 struct: no
 miszu: cuz you start with nothing and learn which moves a re better
 struct: what does mcts learn?
 orangesnowfox: It's a probabilistic search algorithm...
 Nerchio: i will not discuss it anymore i think you are trollig
 Nerchio: trolling*

 Smelty: hi icecream :D
 miszu: my bot sucks... 2 248
 miszu: in silver
 icecream17: hi
 Nerchio: ok time to go back to my machine learning neural network beam search
 Nerchio: kappa
 Smelty: lol im 1153
 Smelty: miszu out of 2268?
 miszu: yeah
 miszu: barely made it to silver
 miszu: I am a weak silver
 Smelty: dang
 Smelty: first round or second round promotion
 miszu: I will use the CCP algorithm
 Smelty: or...whatever
 fvla: Nerchio that's redundant, machine learning = neural network
 icecream17: miszu, are you sure your bot doesn't just crash?
 XeroOl: I'm at 1958 in silver tbh
 fvla: .../s
 XeroOl: bottom of silver
 miszu: gonna look at pros and copy their strats
 fvla: I don't even have a search yet
 fvla: Stuck at 1830 because of that
 XeroOl: this whole two tree thing is eye opening to me
 miszu: I have a stupid strats
 cegprakash: fvla start with linear search
 cegprakash: that's what I do and I'm at top 500 :P
 miszu: I do basic if else with some thresholds
 casmith789: I have no search at 207
 fvla: I just need to finish implementing some stuff
 miszu: I don't feel like doing searches
 ZVRKK: fvla you don't really need search to get out of 1000 rank
 fvla: I'm finishing up a bitboard implementation
 Smelty: yes
 ZVRKK: casmith789 if else&#160;?
 fvla: What I've written is basically C with templates...
 casmith789: my if else bot was about 350 but this one is just an eval function
 XeroOl: do people roll their own memory management?
 XeroOl: or just use std::vector all the way
 fvla: depends
 casmith789: I use vectors until I get timeouts and then be more careful
 fvla: you can use std::vector very efficiently
 Zenoscave: State[] searchStates = State[1000000]
 ZVRKK: casmth789 i work with statements but i'am stuck 500 don't know what to improve&#160;:/
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's 2.2k in silver, that's pretty good
 Zenoscave: casmith789 that's really good
 Zenoscave: Some of these evals are really doing well
 cegprakash: I kinda feel like dbdr predict every move of mine few turns earlier
 Zenoscave: Well how high ranked is he&#160;;)
 cegprakash: no matter how many replays I watch against him I barely have any bugs :P he is just super aggressive and predictive
 cegprakash: he is rank 5 now
 fvla: Does anyone here want to be terrorized by gnarly template code?
 Mourfette: I'm ranking 3 in bronze, just in front of catBoss, how do I get to silver, do I just wait for BATTLES IN PROGRESS to go to 100%?
 Zenoscave: yes Mourfette
 Capim: just wait
 miszu: yeah
 Zenoscave: You'll get a notif when it's done
 fvla: Can I fight catBoss in Silver?
 miszu: and then watch how you get above me in silver
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I still think NN training is gonna win this
 cegprakash: how many points difference Mourfette
 miszu: how can you train a NN
 Mourfette: ok thanks. I'm only losing to the guys in position 1 and 2, but working on that would mean stop the tests, and it's 2 am
 Zenoscave: miszu no. Only top 1000 of your league or below show up
 miszu: and also around you in the leaderboard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: run local miszu, like 2M games
 Zenoscave: if you're below 1000 yeah
 miszu: PatrickMcGinnisII that's what you do?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu nah, but I'm considering it
 miszu: you will need a super good sims
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no timeouts in local. ;0
 AntiSquid: are these good enough miszu&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71otyq1xFNL._SL1499_.jpg">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71otyq1xFNL._SL1499_.jpg</a>
 Zenoscave: no there's only 4 of them
 miszu: I have the game
 Zenoscave: you need more
 miszu: I copied some strats from first people and it improved my bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's 8000+minutes in 6 days... each game for 1M games could only take 1/2 a second...omg, maybe not
 Smelty: o.O
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly not enough time to NN for the win
 PatrickMcGinnisII: interesting thought experiment tho
 miszu: I'll try my tweaked code now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: covered in filth from work, cya
 miszu: alright my code is better now
 miszu: top 2000
 cegprakash: Zenoscave how u win me every game :o
 Rag: do shadows stack?
 struct: yes
 miszu: how can it stack? Either there is shadow on a square or not
 cegprakash: miszu is right
 cegprakash: there is nothing called stacking
 icecream17: if tree size 3 is behind tree size 4, first tree has shadow of "4"
 cegprakash: there is a shadow chain
 icecream17: *size 3 behind size 3
 struct: I think he is asking if a tree of height size 3 that is shadowed will still cast a shadow
 Rag: yeah sorry I was referring to tht 
 miszu: ohh yeah
 XeroOl: does it matter?
 XeroOl: does it change mechanics?
 struct: yes
 itzluku: yes the spooked tree wil still spook others
 miszu: compute each tree's shadow and it willl come to the same
 cegprakash: it doesn't matter in my opinion
 herrmann: Loo for "spooky" in the rules
 cegprakash: XeroOl is right
 itzluku: how is he right, he asked the question XD
 cegprakash: shadow chain or not shadow is a shadow
 icecream17: wait, but if that wasnt true, then you could just put a size 1 tree in front of a size 3 tree, and that size 3 tree wouldnt have a shadow
 XeroOl: itzluku no such thing as a bad question&#160;:)
 miszu: size 3 tree will have its own shadow
 XeroOl: every tree no matter what casts a shadow
 XeroOl: the shadows pass through all other trees
 XeroOl: you can't "block" a shadow
 icecream17: i wasnt saying that
 cegprakash: assuming earth is flat ofcourse chain shadow exist
 miszu: of course the earth is flat
 miszu: everybody knows that
 miszu: conspiracy theorists be like: we send a rocket in space and we did a picture
 Asterixk: say you have a size 2 tree in 3 range from a size 3
 XeroOl: sure
 icecream17: but wait, aren't there mountains
 itzluku: im just saying your answer cant be right or wrong if u didnt even answer, because u made up the question. lul
 icecream17: \s
 XeroOl: @asterixk the 2 tree casts a shadow
 cegprakash: sun is playing hide and seek with my AI
 XeroOl: the shadows overlap, they don't extend eachother's range though
 XeroOl: if multiple trees cast a shadow on the same tile, it will take the properties of the stronger shadow
 cegprakash: le me beat rank 500-600 bots with 100%.. rank 400 to 500 bots be like get the hell outta here with a 0% win rate
 cegprakash: top 500 bots be like "You shall not pass"
 Asterixk: all trees cast shadow from their size gotcha
 Asterixk: no matter if they are spooked, they still cast same shade
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/551723178">https://www.codingame.com/replay/551723178</a> another beautiful game
 cegprakash: clash of the icecreams
 KarlMark: I took 43 lines and couldnt solve a puzzle and someone else in my match did it in one line
 KarlMark: lmao, rip
 cegprakash: F
 miszu: I have a feeling that doing sims is not the key to do well in this comp
 Tyir: if you see typescript, or python in the top 20-30, then you are probably right about sims not being super important 
 icecream17: ceg, your bot _always_ beats me
 miszu: You need super good heuristics that's all
 miszu: and some magic thresholds
 fvla: btw this game is unfair and asymmetrical
 Rag:&#160;?
 fvla: shadows make the game an asymmetrical affair
 icecream17: hmm, if i made tic-tac-toe-grow, i should make it symmetrical somehow
 icecream17: ok, i figured out the perfect way to not place my trees all bunched up
 icecream17: don't place seeds if the seed makes a line with 3 trees
 LLG: randomly reached silver with my half assed beam search üòÜ
 icecream17: nvm, I finally found a position with 8 unused cells where i beat ceg by 1 pt
 ZVRKK: :clap:
 icecream17: oh wait, my ide code actually improved that score
 Wontonimo: LLG way to go!
 Wontonimo: what does your beam search take into account?
 LLG: lemme see
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: anyone able to run the brutalTester?
 LLG: my current trees and the soil quality they're planted on
 LLG: amount of sun points I can generate this turn
 LLG: amount of opponent trees I can block this turn
 LLG: my total score and current sun points
 LLG: I ignore COMPLETE on the first few days, and give infinite priority on COMPLETE if it's the final day
 LLG: negative infinite priority for WAIT if it's the last day, so it will always be the last move performed
 Wontonimo: that's pretty good
 LLG: my main objectives rn are to improve my sim performance, and write a better heuristics
 Wontonimo: i mean, that isn't 1/2ass in my book.  That's pretty comprehensive
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: completing too late will mean you may get less points because of nutrient vaue decreasing
 LLG: the half ass part is that I just threw in random numbers for coefficient
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: something i learnt
 Wontonimo: you asked about brutaltest - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 LLG: on the flip side, completing too early will gut your sun generation and shadow presence
 Wontonimo: Zenoscave was very kind to the community
 LLG: most top bots I observe starts completing around  day 12 or so
 Zenoscave: thx for ping&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: pewpew
 Zenoscave: pewpew
 Wontonimo: hey Zenoscave!
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: wontonimo is this just a fork of the repo with a patch?
 Zenoscave: Yeah
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Awesome
 Wontonimo: not sure, it's not mine ^^.  Thank Zenoscave
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: thx
 LLG: I just realized my bot only completes 1 out of 2 trees in the final round even though it has enough sun for both
 Zenoscave: It still will timeout locally if your bot is slow on your machine. So local tests set timer to like 75ms
 LLG: time to check my move priority code
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok I will keep in mind thanks
 Zenoscave: also `java -Dleague.level=3 -jar spring2021-SNAPSHOT-1.0.jar ...` for bronze and above rules
 Wontonimo: oh, i'm loving my if/else bot.  i haven't had this much fun with non-sim in a long time
 Zenoscave: setting the league.level to 3 in the properties enables bronze rules
 Smelty: o.O
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yep
 Smelty: wontonimo lol
 Smelty: does a if/else plus scoring with if/else count as if/else bot
 Smelty: it only just rates each squar
 Wontonimo: if it doesn't use search (like minimax, MCTS, beam) then it's an if/else
 Smelty: kk if/else gang
 actualCoderTrevor: Is anyone else not seeing the game board right now?
 Wontonimo: there's some steps you can take to reset your browser.  it hasn't happened to me
 Wontonimo: something like turn off graphics acceleration on your browser then restart then turn it back on.  i don't know exactly
 actualCoderTrevor: Hmm I guess I'll try closing all my tabs and restarting my browser first then. Such a shame, this is going to take me a while...
 Wontonimo: try just turning graphics acceleration off then on
 Wontonimo: and just the one tab
 actualCoderTrevor: ok thanks
 Zenoscave: what depth are you all doing for search?
 icecream17: 1
 Zenoscave: I feel like 10 is overkill and limiting my beam radius
 LLG: what's your beam radius atm?
 Zenoscave: 500
 Zenoscave: it seems small
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 LLG: probably so
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: zenoscave I get this. [com.magusgeek.brutaltester.GameThread] ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console. Set system property 'log4j2.debug' to show Log4j2 internal initialization logging.
 NinjaDoggy: zeno how are you counting depth?
 NinjaDoggy: # of actions? or days?
 Zenoscave: # actions
 NinjaDoggy: hm...
 NinjaDoggy: idk i feel like going off days is probably better
 Zenoscave: NotSureWhyThisWorks theres another flag todisable logging one second
 Zenoscave: then I get a depth of 2-3
 NinjaDoggy: otherwise your eval function needs to eval different states from different days
 ClockSort: finally got my monte carlo working. That took way too long.
 Zenoscave: Nah I don't sim opponent yet
 NinjaDoggy: hey ClockSort :D
 NinjaDoggy: nice!
 NinjaDoggy: I finally submitted my MCTS bot too
 ClockSort: how does your MCTS rank?
 NinjaDoggy: currently 23/24 on submit
 NinjaDoggy: rank 242
 ClockSort: sweet
 NinjaDoggy: I almost rage quit an hour ago :P
 ClockSort: do you just put own states into the tree? because if you add opponents states then it seems it would have too many branches?
 actualCoderTrevor: When you have a MCTS bot (or any bot with randomness) do the replays reproduce the game exactly or can it change?
 NinjaDoggy: it's MCTS for simultaneous so it takes into account of both
 NinjaDoggy: bots with randomness will produce different results
 NinjaDoggy: but you can use a tool to get the game from replay
 ClockSort: i guess if each player has 6 trees then that's 36 nodes at depth=1?
 actualCoderTrevor: Thanks
 NinjaDoggy: yea I had to add some aggressive pruning for SEED
 NinjaDoggy: to make it work
 NinjaDoggy: almost gave up earlier without pruning out SEED moves
 NinjaDoggy: 32/34 rank 86 :eyes:
 NinjaDoggy: top 20 submit?
 Zenoscave: nice NinjaDoggy
 Wontonimo: how many simulations are you doing per turn NinjaDoggy&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: damn boi
 ZarthaxX: gz
 NinjaDoggy: uh... i don't really count sim&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: what do you count?
 NinjaDoggy: currently i search depth 5(5 days)
 ZarthaxX: complex eval? :thinking:
 NinjaDoggy: and count iterations
 Zenoscave: beam search?
 Smelty: o.O
 NinjaDoggy: where 1 iterations = playout from current state to 5 days later
 NinjaDoggy: it's MCTS&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 Smelty: ah yes
 Zenoscave: Perhaps opp sim will be needed soon
 NinjaDoggy: i'm still convinced beamsearch sucks this contest
 Wontonimo: right, so how many playouts can you do in like the time constraint?  10,000&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: too hard to sim opponent in it
 Smelty: lol
 Zenoscave: Man my beam search is gonna be complex
 ZarthaxX: do you have a complex eval dogo?
 NinjaDoggy: not too complex
 ZarthaxX: damn
 Zenoscave: score + sun / 3&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 NinjaDoggy: yea that + 2 variables per tree
 Smelty: :rofl:
 NinjaDoggy: and 1 variable for soil
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: hell
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Zenoscave do you know the flag to disable logging to fix the error?
 ZarthaxX: so simple
 Zenoscave: Oh yeaeh one second I spaced
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lol all good
 Zenoscave: well it's a bit more complex than need be. you gotta edit their log4j2.xml file. let me see if I can make a config that silents logs and make a second branch for it
 NinjaDoggy: oh and I simulate each day's shadows in my eval which i guess you can argue is "complex" 
 ZarthaxX: so till end of game to know sun points avg
 ZarthaxX: like toad said
 NinjaDoggy: yea
 ZarthaxX: i meant complex in design, not expensive
 ZarthaxX: but nice
 NinjaDoggy: gonna spend tomorrow optimizing performance and tweaking constants XD
 ZarthaxX: haha gl with that
 ZarthaxX: is this like smitsi mcts
 ZarthaxX: or your own
 ZarthaxX: thought it didnt work
 NinjaDoggy: it's a pretty popular simul mcts
 NinjaDoggy: not smitsi though cuz valid actions change too much
 ZarthaxX: ah i see
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: still ,the big problem with this game is evaluating states in different days
 ZarthaxX: your approach fixes that i guess
 ZarthaxX: it's cool
 NinjaDoggy: yea... it kinda does not really though :P
 ZarthaxX: oh&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: i'm thinking about building a big table of constants one per day...
 NinjaDoggy: and somehow auto tuning but
 NinjaDoggy: we'll see
 ZarthaxX: gl with that haha
 ZarthaxX: prob top 20&#160;:)
 ClockSort: the hardest part of this game is knowing when to cut the first tree
 NinjaDoggy: yea simul mcts does that part really well inherently i think
 ClockSort: but if you only go to depth 5, how does it foresee game end?
 ClockSort: i.e. if nutrients were 40 or game was 36 turns, depth 5 would act the same.
 NinjaDoggy: um.. depth 5 is pretty deep i think
 NinjaDoggy: like midgame around 10-15
 NinjaDoggy: if you choose to start cutting trees and forsee consequences till 15-20
 ClockSort: oh, you mean 5 days, not 5 turns..&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: it's enough
 NinjaDoggy: yea 5 days
 ClockSort: first cut seems like it's around day 10-15
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: untzing
 Wontonimo: good job NinjaDoggy
 dartz27: hi ninjadoggy
 NinjaDoggy: thanks Wontonimo!
 NinjaDoggy: hi dartz27
 dartz27: is your name yibo
 NinjaDoggy: ._. leaking?
 dartz27: what
 dartz27: is it actually
 Zenoscave: dartz27 this seems like a not global chat discussion&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: ok looks like depth 20 actions works a lot better.
 Zenoscave: even if less raduis
 ZarthaxX: did you notice that depth 1 works better than depth 5 for example?
 NinjaDoggy: nice
 Zenoscave: me ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: yes
 Zenoscave: Haven't tried either
 ZarthaxX: okey&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: does that mean bad eval if a lower depth is better?
 ZarthaxX: idk haha
 Smelty: lol
 bitsNflips: Zarthax r u working on a sim or pure heuristics&#160;?
 Smelty: o . o
 Thienu: i literally add one feature to my bot and it went from rank 800 to top 40
 Thienu: what
 Kellthazar: Hmmm.. did some improvement on my if/else code and climbed some positions. XD
 Wontonimo: cool Thienu , and is it sim or if/else&#160;?
 Thienu: its if/else
 Wontonimo: very very nice
 Thienu: well also technically depth 1 sim
 ZarthaxX: WAT?
 ZarthaxX: let me guess
 bitsNflips: 0.O
 ZarthaxX: deciding when to complete trees
 ZarthaxX: e.e
 Thienu: actually no lol
 Thienu: i need to work on that
 Thienu: it was about tree spacing
 Thienu: and placement
 ZarthaxX: wow impressive
 ZarthaxX: oh placement
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: gz anyway &lt;3
 Kellthazar: Thienu thats impressive... o.O
 Smelty: wow
 Thienu: thx Kellthazar
 Kellthazar: yieks 103 x 139 against the Thienu's bot.

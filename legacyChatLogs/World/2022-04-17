 SubZeRoy9: What is another easy coding game besides mars lander? 
 SubZeRoy9: I know theres an easy section but some of them are kind of hard
 Uljahn: best bet would be to solve classic puzzles rather than community ones
 Uljahn: e.g. The Descent, Temperatures, Power of Thor ep.1, Horse-racing duals
 SubZeRoy9: ok cool ty. I like this site because of the community and multiplayer but its a little tough. Im trying to get good enough to participate. Are there any other games you would suggest if I like this?
 SubZeRoy9: That are easier*
 Uljahn: clash of code should be easier but those have a time limit
 SubZeRoy9: Ty
 Passifi: Ah nothing quiet like coming back to a problem looking at suddenly having an idea that seems super obvious and thinking: "Man, past me was a real idiot"
 marouane572: Hey guys. I just joined this site yesterday and I'm trying to find the past problems I solved in clash of codes and I can't find them. Are they accessible anywhere?
 DaNinja: you can search for them here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 marouane572: thanks!
 marouane572: i see there's also a script to get your past submissions, too bad we can't do that through the website&#160;:/
 DaNinja: not sure if that script works on clashes
 TTK4K: Hello
 Scarfield: DaNinja :taco:
 Scarfield: nooo
 DaNinja: antiwontooo
 Scarfield: badword
 jacek: balls eh
 Scarfield: shouldn't an antiwonto and a wonto cancel eachother out :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: that's why none of them is here now
 aykhanu: then your dad and your other dad should too
 Scarfield: did you see my link yesterday euler?
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/HUvJFe.jpg">https://snipboard.io/HUvJFe.jpg</a> from 2 minute papers xD
 Scarfield: someone made an antieuler :scream:
 G0DofCODING: nice cock dude
 eulerscheZahl: yes Scarfield. somehow i can't watch that 2 minute paper channel. interesting content but the voice is annoying
 jacek: banned from youtube?
 jacek: D:
 Scarfield: mute and subtitles could fix that i suppose?
 jacek: read from lips
 eulerscheZahl: reading subtitles is annoying, i'd rather just read a text then
 jacek: so you dont watch anime
 eulerscheZahl: no, back to topcoder now
 Scarfield: thats why you learn japanese
 jacek: :head_bandage:
 addmore: hie
 jacek: Scarfield will you do the contest
 SubZeRoy9: :martial_arts_uniform:
 jacek: :upside_down:

 Golden_den: hi
 Golden_den: what's up
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm clashing
 Golden_den: so do I
 ASM_MOV_INT: um, still clashing....! how's everyone?
 Astrobytes: ASM_MOV_INT: I'm great, not clashing and not doing topcoder marathon
 Astrobytes: it's an interesting one though, in retrospect I should have done it
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm back
 ASM_MOV_INT: they have marathons?
 Darleanow: hellooooooooo
 Wontonimo: hi
 Wontonimo: have you been practicing by redoing problems you've already solve before?
 Wontonimo: if so, or if not, how's it going Darleanow&#160;?
 Darleanow: hello wonto
 Darleanow: i'm drunk as hell

 Darleanow: but i did one challenge
 Darleanow: largest numbers
 Wontonimo: nice, have a good night
 Darleanow: thanks wonto, u too&#160;:)
 SubZeRoy9: Does anyone have experience with using codingame to get a job? Could you put it on your resume to show experience? lol. I cant use it now, I have a hard time solving simple puzzles I was just curious.

 BenjaminUrquhart: "back in my day, the only chat bot was Automaton2000"
 Automaton2000: im not even sure if it is in the top league
 Urutar: Automaton2000, you certainly are :D
 Chris_C769: these instructions make no sense
 Automaton2000: you probably have to rewrite my bot
 Urutar: Which instructions?
 Chris_C769: for the coding game challenge
 Urutar: Entry code?
 Chris_C769: This should be called question challenge not coding challenge the wording is terrible
 bollocks32: :snake:
 Urutar: Ehhh, there are far worse ones
 Chris_C769: I can't imagine
 Chris_C769: it's like the challenges are only difficult because they don't tell you what to do
 Urutar: At some point, you'll be able to^^
 Urutar: Nah, sometimes they just have hard to grasp mathematical or technical ideas behind them
 Chris_C769: agree on the math one sometimes that true but other times there are terrible instructions I'm doing one where you have to shoot an enemy no instructions only one way to do it yet I'm wrong.  Makes no sense.  It tells you select closest enemy by distance.  Yet clearly that is not what you are to do
 Chris_C769: When they say select closest enemy by distance they must mean something else all together

 MarinDeNsi: according to you, which programmation's language is the one with the least size of syntaxe&#160;? thx by advance for answering&#160;!
 BobLob: There are several Turing complete languages with 8 instructions ( I made a variant with only 1 instruction, but it was cheating by abusing MOV ).   They're usually considered toy languages, though
 BobLob: For a language actually in use, C has 32 keywords.  I'm not sure if it's the smallest by that metric, but it has to be close

 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/9tEk0D0Z">https://pastebin.com/9tEk0D0Z</a>Machine is the abstract/base class, but I want to have this method working for all the child classes. The problem is, when I define it as an abstract class, I can't construct the Machine object in my function parameter list.
 Manchi_o6o7: Is there any walk around
 wlesavo: you cant construct objects of the abstract class, thats the whole point, but you can make an object of a child and create base class pointer from it
 Manchi_o6o7: But is there any way to achieve this funcionality. where I want the Machine object basically to be some_derived_class
 Manchi_o6o7: so I don't need to define multiple times methods that are the same, for every derived class

 Astrobytes: oh nice, afk for 2 hours and now I'm pushed to legend in spider attack :tada:
 5DN1L: :clap:
 Aghiles09: NVM
 darkhorse64: grats: Astrobytes and your rank is quite high. Any tips&#160;?
 Astrobytes: thanks darkhorse64! Hm, really nothing special, didn't use control at all. Defender and farmer do the same thing except defender stays a little closer to base, only use wind at a certain distance from base. Attacker immediately to enemy base and wind as much as possible
 Astrobytes: Also attacker uses shield 
 Astrobytes: It's the same code from the contest, just with a few values changed here and there :D
 Astrobytes: (all my rewrites failed)
 BlurLeBogoss: anyone valorant&#160;?
 BlurLeBogoss: feur
 BlurLeBogoss: patron
 Astrobytes: I have to say it's not at all a good bot, yet effective enough.

 Astrobytes: 5DN1L
 5DN1L: You too, Aghiles09
 5DN1L: kicked
 Astrobytes: ty
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 5DN1L: why would someone go to a place and randomly ask others to shut up? how weird
 darkhorse64: I have found that using spawn points as guardpositions for my farmers is good
 darkhorse64: at least for the initial phase
 Astrobytes: Yeah I had a version doing that last night, was quite effective but it broke my submit higher up in the league so I reverted
 Astrobytes: Now I don't know if I wish to keep working on it or move on to something else
 BlurLeBogoss: Astrobytes my friend Aghiles09 apologize for saying bad thing
 darkhorse64: maybe try to implement wind cannon just for fun
 Astrobytes: I think I might start by refactoring a little, it's only 500 lines but it's horrible 
 darkhorse64: Sort out before expansion :relaxed:
 Astrobytes: Definitely!
 mounir.: hey bitchis
 BlurLeBogoss: hello the racist
 Uljahn: both kicked

 NewCoder09: i have exams next week
 NewCoder09: though
 Wontonimo: hi Darleanow and NewCoder09 :wave:
 Ayza: is stealing the boss's strategy a good idea lol
 Ayza: sparing one hero at the enemy's base to use control on the enemy heroes
 Astrobytes: control isn't even needed, just winding spiders at the enemy base is enough
 Ayza: you really got to legend without it? damn
 Ayza: gotta try that
 Astrobytes: It will depend on your defence/farming strategy too though, everyones code is different&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: ideally I'd have been using control + wind but I'll do that after the rewrite perhaps
 PrzemekS: guys i got math problem.  I made dot product of two normalized vectors (monster movement vector and from monster pos to my base vector) . When dot product reaches 1 i know monster is going straight to my base, but what about the minimum (to reach base radius), i don't want to guess 0.6 or something , any math way to do that?
 Uljahn: you mean ray-circle intersection?
 Wontonimo: I do it the dumb*ss way, just simulate a few dozen moves and test
 PrzemekS: yes ray-circle intersection
 Wontonimo: also, if the mob is within your base radius it is always aiming for your base

 ImSeaFu: I've been told you're someone I should get to know since you're good with ML xD
 DomiKo: euler should I tell him?
 ImSeaFu: So hello!
 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;:)
 jacek: my Mars Lander is just bunch of ifs ;d
 eulerscheZahl: he has the link already. i also shared it on the forum
 DomiKo: I will tell him tomorrow then :D
 eulerscheZahl: real life pings can be more efficient sometimes

 DomiKo: some days*
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'll find some motivation to give the game a try then
 eulerscheZahl: it looks really cool
 DomiKo: it's really cool
 jacek: ImSeaFu any question?
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow, between real contests, i didn't get to play it&#160;:(
 ImSeaFu: rofl wow I'm dumb I thought you meant that your Mars Lander is shitty machine learning but I get now that you were subbing for ML xD
 jacek: oO
 ImSeaFu: I mean about a bajillion but I gotta do some more studying. Just making myself known so that when I get hard stuck and need help that you at least have heard from me before xD
 jacek: :thinking:
 ImSeaFu: I've only really done the Google ML Crashcourse and am now in your Neural Network Xor example from scratch xD
 ImSeaFu: So I got a ways to go xD
 ImSeaFu: but machine learning is really what I'm most interested in learning so gotta chip away at it xD
 jacek: are you scarfield by any chance
 ImSeaFu: But after doing the google crashcourse I was kinda just sitting there going like "great so now I know a bunch of theory, and have some pre-written code, but I don't feel like I even know where to begin with actually using it"
 ImSeaFu: maybe, I don't know what a scarfield is so it's hard to say xD
 jacek: ok so youre not ;d
 ImSeaFu: Well that's a relief
 jacek: do you have some programming background?
 ImSeaFu: I've been programming on and off extremely poorly for 20 years
 ImSeaFu: so not really
 DomiKo: 20 years damn
 ImSeaFu: Just over the last few months have I really started taking it more seriously. My fundamentals were/are really bad because I have/had a bad habit of just rushing to higher end things without truly understanding it
 jacek: so machine learning in essential
 ImSeaFu: Picked up Python since I heard it's one of the leading languages for machine learning
 ImSeaFu: No, learning everything, lol I'm a really bad programmer, 20 years or not I did not study well, practice much, or have good habits at all
 ImSeaFu: you should pretty much consider me a newbie. Maybe like 6 months of actual knowledge
 ImSeaFu: Like I still struggle with classes and basic shit xD

 ImSeaFu: doh
 DomiKo: xd
 ImSeaFu: bad language
 ImSeaFu: But yeah if anyone has any advice for things I should look at to help my study that'd be cool, for now though I am going through this playground and seeing if I can understand it xD
 ImSeaFu: hmmmm what is for _ in range(HIDDEN): for example? like what is the _?
 jacek: normally youd write for i in range(), but since i is not needed, its replaced by _
 Disa86: @ImSeaFu "_" coube "i" or "a", it's just a name for the item you are currently operating on in the iterable "HIDDEN"
 ImSeaFu: so it's basically just like a token that says "idgaf what this is?"
 DomiKo: _ in python is like a trash can
 ImSeaFu: ahhh kk
 jacek: so this for loop will run for HIDDEN times
 ImSeaFu: that's what I was confused about, I've seen i and other variables but _ isn't a valid variable name afaik so I was confused
 5DN1L: you can change _ to anything you want
 jacek: ok, ill change it to range
 jacek: :kissing_heart:
 ImSeaFu: xD
 5DN1L: not reserved words...
 ImSeaFu: I'm going to change it to HIDDEN
 5DN1L: for HIDDEN in range(HIDDEN)?
 ImSeaFu: yep
 5DN1L: no, that won't work
 Disa86: @ImSeaFu If you're looking to learn the basics of machine learning and you wanna start with Python I highly recommend "Neural Networks From Scratch in Python" by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela
 ImSeaFu: it'll create a blackhole and explode I'm sure of it
 5DN1L: yup :smirk:
 Disa86: it's a great book for beginners
 ImSeaFu: Book is really the worst way for me to learn
 ImSeaFu: I have very bad ADHD so keeping myself focused on a book is tough
 Disa86: it's complete with exercises for you to follow along, and QR codes to youtube animations to help you understand
 ImSeaFu: :O
 ImSeaFu: now you're speaking my language
 Disa86: honnestly one of the least boring programming books I've ever read lol

 ImSeaFu: Hmmm so maybe this is a dumb question but I'm not what you'd call a big "reader". if I get the eBook can I read that on my PC easily or is it gonna be a big pain in the ass?
 Disa86: There's a PDF version only on the official website if you want
 struct: I bought the pdf
 Disa86: nnfs.io is the site if I recall correctly
 Disa86: yup it is
 jacek: struct you bought from smits?

 HenroLST: ...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ok, a woman just lost her baby near here, I'll drop it in her gofundme
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's a gremlin in the IDE
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Astrobytes: good lad Patrick
 HenroLST: cheers!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just turned this
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a:3:{i:0;a:2:{i:0;i:32;i:1;i:2;}i:1;a:2:{i:0;i:65;i:1;i:3;}i:2;a:2:{i:0;i:83;i:1;i:4;}}
 PatrickMcGinnisII: into
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 82@;DL
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm done for today, glhf
 Astrobytes: I thought it was some kind of opening book lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it could be
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hope you see your friend dude, take care
 jacek: opening books are more like this 搯擋擾撻攕攥断旝旋昁晕曐旴机暩晞曩曡杋憇戲斔扲斔揞摸擆擐擉摻搏揆搅捤掶撐撍斉斀暕晗曢柪枡帢椙暉泼柫昚斁攉揚
 Astrobytes: of course, but you know what I mean
 Wontonimo: oh, that opening book.  i know it well&#160;;)
 struct: my openings book usually fit in 64 bits
 jacek: the story, characters development and that plot twist!
 Astrobytes: Enough chars for even M. Night. Shyamalamalamanalamanna... I  give up
 Astrobytes: (re. plot twist)
 Astrobytes: Incidentally: M. Night clearly stands for Mad (k)Night. Silent 'k'.
 jacek: the inventor of mad pod racing?
 Astrobytes: "inventor" :D
 Astrobytes: I think it was Squid who invented that name iirc
 Astrobytes: then Tibo ran with it when it came to changing the names
 jacek: :taco: derjack
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded derjack 10 tacos. derjack now has 50 taco. jacek now has 33 taco
 TKirishima: AutomatonNN
 Wontonimo: more farming eh jacek&#160;?
 jacek: eeyup
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: I never thought anyone would be farming tacos in my life
 Astrobytes: via *your* taco bot
 jacek: need more balls <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/qgza5b">https://streamable.com/qgza5b</a>
 Astrobytes: BR, nice. Did you succeed in SR?
 jacek: darn openai evolution strategies are lit. my crappy GA cant compare with them. training in minutes instead of hours
 jacek: not yet, still figuring out how to evolve and coevolve with opponents
 Astrobytes: ahh, cool project though
 jacek: im hoping to create successive training framework for such games like i already have for board games. so more leaderboard to own :imp:
 Astrobytes: More power to you if you can succeed man, I think it's a nice evolution of the platform for lots of NN/ML action
 struct: why 2 balls on first frames?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/sMllpW8.png">https://i.imgur.com/sMllpW8.png</a>
 jacek: there are 2 balls in br2k
 jacek: the nn inputs see only one ball at one moment
 struct: you are right
 jacek: unless the car carries one
 struct: I just didnt see it in the other frames
 struct: due to the transparency 
 jacek: this is nn. two ouputs - thrust and angle. even if i have decent blackbox that tells me the action, i dont know how to use it in search yet
 VIPTrollik: send code pics
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/tj1ZnnB.png">https://i.imgur.com/tj1ZnnB.png</a>
 struct: there
 jacek: c4?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: nice guess
 jacek: i judge from code :v
 Astrobytes: kinda obvious now I read it :D
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: lmao
 struct: why is it capslocked after the _
 struct: wtf
 Astrobytes: easy enough to fix
 Astrobytes: Or keep it, but -1000 style points
 Wontonimo: you can use an attention network to identify the ball to focus on jacek
 jacek: well the problem with br2k how to do inputs right. for example 2 balls, inputs should be order invariant
 Wontonimo: heck, the attention network could even order the balls so that the balls are order variant based on importance
 Wontonimo: and it will learn to place the balls in the correct input
 jacek: any tutorial i could read on this?
 jacek: keep in mind right now im training via neuroevolution, randomly perturbing wights instead of some smart q-learning thing
 Wontonimo: hmm... the attention network is just an eval per ball.  given the balls data and the player, is the ball important?
 Wontonimo: very much like your other NNs, but this NN is applied to each ball, and you sort the balls based on that eval
 jacek: NN for sorting the inputs?
 Wontonimo: imagine you have data for each ball, let's call it matrix [X]
 Wontonimo: score the ball givenM2*tanh(M1*X + B1) +B2
 Wontonimo: do this for all balls
 Wontonimo: sort the balls given that scoring
 Astrobytes: there are only 2 balls
 Wontonimo: ever?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 jacek: it could be 1 or 0 if someone has it
 Wontonimo: oh, that makes it easier
 Astrobytes: BitRunner 2048
 Astrobytes: true jacek but the balls technically still exist
 Wontonimo: X is 2d, so let it have 2 rows
 Wontonimo: and the output is 2 values
 Wontonimo: 1 for the 1st ball, 1 for the 2nd ball
 Wontonimo: Dense(Dense(balls data))
 Wontonimo: where the final output is 1 value per ball
 Wontonimo: the ball with the higher output is the primary
 jacek: and based on this put it into main network?
 Wontonimo: yeah, have the higher ranked one go to the 1st position in the main network.
 Wontonimo: once you have that working, make room in your main network to accept a second ball and put the second ball input into it.
 Wontonimo: treat the second ball data as if it is something completely different and not a ball.  just 'additional data' 
 jacek: ok. if this works, i can do that for order of enemy cars as well.
 Wontonimo: yes
 jacek: thanks. ill have somehting to work on
 Wontonimo: cool!  let me know how it goes
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: that's an interesting idea, I'm no NN person (yet) but I like that
 Astrobytes: and what of the situation where an enemy car is carrying a ball? Or any car for that matter
 Wontonimo: I use that for a chatbot I developed at work for it to decided between different response handlers.  It's the bomb
 Astrobytes: nice, lightweight too
 jacek: Automaton2000 can i have your attention?
 Automaton2000: i just don't know it
 Wontonimo: for the chatbot, a particular response handler has some phrases that it is looking for like "how far is the moon" and "help" and "what is the correct mortgage calculation for including home equity loans".  It uses cosine distance over known matching phrases to see if it is the right handler.  Then the right handler will try and solve the problem.
 Wontonimo: This lets me add more handlers without having to do anything with the previous ones or re-balance some decision tree
 Astrobytes: Smart!
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 TKirishima: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i made a bot for a game like that
 jacek: oh my
 <b>**TKirishima is impressed</b></p><p><img src="/a/23956705948685" /> Uljahn: cosine distance means word2vec but for phrases?
 Astrobytes: that was my understanding
 ImSeaFu: @wotonimo 5DN1L recommended your YT channel for ML, any recommendation with which video to start with?
 Wontonimo: yes Uljahn
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: my channel for learning ML?  No, there are only a few videos nothing like a course.
 waterproofsodium: is there a place where I can practice?
 jacek: you can start with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 waterproofsodium: without solving a particular problem?
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry, i re-read you question Uljahn and not that' it's the right thing
 ImSeaFu: jacek -.-
 ImSeaFu: I know that URL anywhere
 Wontonimo: oh man, i fell for it
 ImSeaFu: xD
 Wontonimo: ImSeaFu , check out this set of videos&#160;! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/resources/lecture-1-introduction-and-scope/">https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/resources/lecture-1-introduction-and-scope/</a>
 ImSeaFu: I feel like in trying to learn this whole ML thing I just end up going over the exact same info over and over again xD
 jacek: put it into practical use
 ImSeaFu: I'm so far from being able to do that
 Wontonimo: what do you want to do with ML&#160;?
 ImSeaFu: I mean lots of stupid stuff, but obviously you gotta learn the basics before that xD
 Wontonimo: for example, let's say you have written some tricky function that returns a nice Eval for Spring Challenge 2021 
 jacek: i was doing much stuff before i understood ml
 jacek: frankly, the more i work with NNs the less i understand how they work
 Wontonimo: and this eval you have written has a lot of magic numbers in it, like constants you've hand tuned
 ImSeaFu: One of the things the piqued my interest a few years back was SethBling's MarI/O program that learned to play 1-1 on it's own
 jacek: how about this mario with GA <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI3FRsSAa_U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI3FRsSAa_U</a>
 Wontonimo: well, you could make all those magic numbers be variables (we call then hyperparameters because we are fancy) and you could use something like evolution to discover the best hyperparameters
 jacek: it even learned to wall jump
 Wontonimo: that's effectively what jacek is doing with his neuro evolution
 Wontonimo: in his case the entire NN is treated as hyperparameters
 ImSeaFu: I mean I feel like I'm not even close to being able to do that. Like it feels like there is a step missing in between where I am and where I need to go but I have no idea what that step is
 Wontonimo: okay, here is a super super intro <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUPFOFbCeFI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUPFOFbCeFI</a>  .  Tell me what you think
 Astrobytes: (you pushed him hard enough to recommend his own video! More of that!)
 Astrobytes: It's a great video.
 Wontonimo: :taco: Astrobytes
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded Astrobytes 10 tacos. Astrobytes now has 54 taco. Wontonimo now has 13 taco
 ImSeaFu: Cause I went through the Google ML Crashcourse and went over a lot of the terminology, techniques for getting lower loss, etc. But all of the code was provided to me, I was essentially just messing with some dials which needless to say is much different than being able to build it on your own xD
 ImSeaFu: Well I already feel discriminated on by your video
 Astrobytes: #taco channel should be called #TacoHell
 ImSeaFu: "Have a clear mental image of how ML works"
 Wontonimo: What?  how did my video discriminate?  I really watch out for that stuff
 ImSeaFu: All well and good for people who don't have aphantasia like me :P
 Wontonimo: oh.  i have aphantasia also
 jacek: w00t
 Wontonimo: i don't mean mines eye mental image
 ImSeaFu: Lol I was just messing with you, I mean I do have aphantasia but I'm not actually offended :P
 Wontonimo: i always thought was was poetic until just a few years ago i discovered people actually could 'see' things in their mind
 jacek: apparently lucid dreaming isnt affected by aphantasia. people with aphantasia report on LD forums they do fact have lucid dreams and theyre vivid
 Wontonimo: weird to think people are walking around hallucinating all the time
 ImSeaFu: lol yeah.... no one ever told me that normies can actually see things when they close their eyes xD
 Wontonimo: yes, i can control my dreams.  but also sometimes my dreams are super abstract wiithout dimensions
 jacek: the imagea are fogg, fragmented mostly
 Wontonimo: My wife and kids are on the opposite side of the spectrum and can for example count the spots on the family cat from memory
 Astrobytes: I don't have full-on visions when I try to visualise things, very far from it, nothing 'visual' at all mostly, but it's *there*
 Astrobytes: and I have a strong imagination/creative side
 Astrobytes: I believe I am in the middle
 jacek: replay experience buffer is like imagination isnt it
 Wontonimo: So there are at least 2 separate areas in the brain for remembering visualish stuff.  one that is 2d-ish and colour, and another that is 3d-ish and conceptual.  The second is usually considered spacial awareness, it allows you to know there is a chair behind you without having to 'see it in your mind'
 Wontonimo: i have a stong 3d spacial awareness but no iiimage/colour thing
 Astrobytes: I'm colourblind too so that probably doesn't help
 Astrobytes: also: "colour" :D :tada:
 jacek: no voices either?
 Wontonimo: no, only my own
 Wontonimo: even when remembering a song, it is my voice, even for the instruments
 Astrobytes: That's interesting, for that kind of thing I can definitely get other voices
 Astrobytes: is there a left-brain/right-brain thing here?
 Astrobytes: or hemisphere if you want to be correct
 Wontonimo: i don't think so.  i think it is a what-you-practice-when-young thing
 Astrobytes: I've been cursed with creativity and logical leanings
 Astrobytes: so I've always been into art, music and technical stuff
 Astrobytes: nightmare at school, nightmare in life
 Wontonimo: when i was practicing mnemonics a lot it seemed like I was getting more detail in my minds eye and not just concepts being placed in space but just wisps of detail like textures and noise.  it would surprise me
 Wontonimo: when i stop practicing every day it went away
 Wontonimo: yeah, me too Astrobytes, but not having a minds ear music has been difficult
 Wontonimo: Hey ImSeaFu , did you find the video helpful?
 Astrobytes: so many methods and so many wrong methods of retaining/absorbing information and *there is no one correct way*
 Astrobytes: Since we don't fully understand how it's done, and indeed if it is done in the same way in different individuals (although similarity in region of brain etc is obviously proven)
 jacek: maybe you just have too little learning rate
 Astrobytes: it is hard to discern some foolproof method
 Wontonimo: i've often that was my issue jacek&#160;;)
 ImSeaFu: Wontonimo I just finished watching it and I'd have found it helpful if this wasn't the same concepts that I've gone over in like 3+ different courses/videos/tutorials
 jacek: have you done xor example?
 ImSeaFu: Like I get that you use data to create a functioon, I get that learning rate is how big of steps it's going to take, that kind of stuff but I have no idea how to implement any of this information
 ImSeaFu: I was looking at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59631/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59631/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs</a>
 Wontonimo: hey, i've heard of that author&#160;;)
 ImSeaFu: and I just got completely confused, I have no idea what it's trying to learn, I have no idea where it's getting the data from, I see a bunch of familiar things in the code but as a whole I don't get it xD
 Astrobytes: you can check the version *with* libs that's out there 
 Astrobytes: before going to jaceks one
 Wontonimo: do you know matrix math ImSeaFu&#160;?
 Wontonimo: like if X, M, and B are matries, could you compute MX + B
 ImSeaFu: 5DN1L thought that it would be better to learn without the libraries so that I actually understand what the libraries are doing
 ImSeaFu: Uhhh no
 Astrobytes: Either way, you should look at them both.
 Wontonimo: AH!  okay man, that there is something you want to review if you want to do NNs from scratch
 jacek: libraries do magic. you cant learn from magic much
 Wontonimo: but ignore NNs.
 Wontonimo: let's focus on ML like in my video
 Astrobytes: Yeah but you see what they produce. Then go for the juicy stuff
 Wontonimo: where you are trying to 'discover' values from data
 Wontonimo: do you think you could write that code in the video without looking at the video or tthe links?
 Astrobytes: Wait, no linear algebra experience at all or...&#160;? ImSeaFu
 jacek: he only done non-linear algebra ~
 ImSeaFu: I'm very bad with terminology when it comes to math. Like I have experience with the graphing quadratic equations, and that kind of shizz but idk if that's the same stuff xD
 ImSeaFu: wait which code? did I already forget? I remember you talking about checkers xD
 Astrobytes: linear equations, transformations, vectors, matrices...
 jacek: code?
 ImSeaFu: responding to wontonimo
 ImSeaFu: but I think that answers the question xD
 ImSeaFu: No I could not do that
 Astrobytes: A basic foundation in linear algebra would be helpful to you I think, don't worry, it's not that bad
 ImSeaFu: Lol maybe I'm too dumb for ML xD
 ImSeaFu: Maybe someone can come up with a model that can train me? xD
 Astrobytes: dumb is a state of mind
 Astrobytes: Use your personal NN.
 Astrobytes: If you find you are lacking in prerequisites for LA then go back and do those too. It will serve you well either way
 ImSeaFu: Whoever put together my NN needs to go back to the drawing board xD
 Astrobytes: Are you at college or school or&#160;?
 ImSeaFu: No
 Wontonimo: lol
 ImSeaFu: Due to mental health I wasn't able to go to post secondary
 ImSeaFu: Now I'm idk like 32 or something
 ImSeaFu: Trying to learn this and struggling quite thoroughly xD
 Wontonimo: hey ImSeaFu, you said that you've seen that same content 3 times but that you can't code it without reference.  From that I will recommend _practicing_ coding it from memory.  The act of doing so will solidify the concepts in my mind
 Astrobytes: That's cool, and still doable. And listen to Wontonimo.
 Astrobytes: You are also trying to run before you crawl
 Astrobytes: Which isn't a bad ambition but it's bad practice
 Wontonimo: it's like trying to juggle, ride a unicycle, and play a harmonica all at once.  It's not effective.  Practice one small element (juggling) and perfect it.  In this case, it's recalling doing parameter optimization like in the video by heart
 waterproofsodium: playing fastest: 3/8, 4/8, 1/2
 waterproofsodium: playing shortest: 8/8 -.-
 Wontonimo: gotta go
 Astrobytes: later Wontonimo, take care
 Wontonimo: keep in touch ImSeaFu and let me know how you progress
 waterproofsodium: bb Wontonimo
 ImSeaFu: I think what I'll do is write your code by hand and then try to comment it to see if I understand it
 ImSeaFu: toodles wonton
 Astrobytes: I'm out too, music and beer time, see you all tomorrow!
 Astrobytes: (or whenever)
 ImSeaFu: Lol I mean atm I've been up for something like 40 hour straight so I'm probably gonna wait til I've slept to bang my head at this some more
 ImSeaFu: oh shhhht I'm not 32 I'm 31 lol it's not been my birthday yet

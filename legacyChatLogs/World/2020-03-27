 Javatacos: does anyone know can you shoot other peoples mines?
 sean12: hello
 Manvir: can i have a hiiiya 
 Swagboy: Can't Javatacos
 Hemingwaycn: :grimacing:
 Hemingwaycn: how can i debug the ocean of code at my local ide
 eulerscheZahl: my workflow: make the bot print every input given directly to stderr
 eulerscheZahl: then copy all the error output to a local textfile
 eulerscheZahl: use that textfile as input for your local execuation
 eulerscheZahl: i automated that process to download the replay and extract the error stream into that file instead of copy-pasting by hand
 Hemingwaycn: thx
 Hemingwaycn: and  i want to take a breakpoint, can i do that?
 eulerscheZahl: you can do whatever your local IDE supports
 struct: euler hi
 struct: you have deduplication for states?
 eulerscheZahl: not really
 eulerscheZahl: i have but it's broken
 struct: i see, I wonder if its worth
 eulerscheZahl: pb says it's not
 kovi: theoriteically there is no dedup
 eulerscheZahl: only little pruning but takes a lot of time
 eulerscheZahl: movement order can matter if you track mine placements
 kovi: and possibility for same path is rare
 eulerscheZahl: yeswe got slightly different results on a test match
 eulerscheZahl: i got 2064 and he got 2028 (don't nail me on the exact numbers)
 eulerscheZahl: at least it was really close
 eulerscheZahl: egaetan: you've got 41/2064 i've got 41/2024
 eulerscheZahl: close enough
 eulerscheZahl: good that dbdr archives the chats now <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-03-23">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-03-23</a>
 struct: doesnt seem worth it then
 eulerscheZahl: i do a cleanup on SURFACE
 struct: Are you going to change that?
 dbdr: happy it is useful&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no plans yet
 eulerscheZahl: first i gotta track myself to reveal as little info as possible
 struct: by cleanup, do you clean possible mines placed aswell?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have a mine history for the opponent
 struct: So you dont take into account mine action from opponent at all?
 egaetan: hi eulerscheZahl, we have got a difference in number of paths&#160;? 
 tempux: Is it against the rules if I push my code into a public github repo?
 Uljahn: ye, i'll be disqualified
 Uljahn: also those who copy
 Uljahn: *you'll
 tempux: ok, thanks
 kovi: finally
 barbora: :thumbsup:
 Tunga: Why it is forbidden to push codes into github? 
 Tunga: Is it because the game is ongoing?
 MadKnight: Tunga only to public repos cuz somebody can find your code and steal it
 RonaldsZ: Hey, does clash of code shortest code mode count whitespaces?
 RonaldsZ: So that would mean that I have to delete all the whitespaces for shorter code&gt;
 RonaldsZ:&#160;?
 EleetCodeR: What to do if we get stuck and need help? can we ask others for help?
 dbdr: what are you tuck with EleetCodeR?
 EleetCodeR: some issue with test cases 3 and 4 of Power of Thor...even though code seems correct.
 dbdr: sure, you can ask
 EleetCodeR: I am guessing I can't show my code to understand what i am doing wrong?
 Nixerrr: EleetCodeR You can past your code here, it'll auto-convert to a pastebin link
 dbdr: you can alwasy try. depends how long it is
 Nixerrr: The most common issue ppl have with those is not updating thor's coordinates
 Nixerrr: *paste your code
 EleetCodeR: oh right...my understanding was subsys will provide updated thor co-ordinates after every move...as it was showing on console..let me try... will ask you if i still can't get it
 EleetCodeR: Thanks alot guys.
 Tunga: MadKnight you mean even the puzzle codes are forbidden to publish or competitive codes only?
 struct: damn pb4
 struct: What have you done?
 pb4: lucky streak
 pb4: not much compared to the push 10mn ago
 pb4: which was 5th...
 struct: Damn but its 2 points difference still
 struct: Anyways you are doing good, for a type you are not good at
 RonaldsZ: Do languages in shortest code CoC have some coefficients?
 RonaldsZ: for example c# needs like using system and all that stuff
 RonaldsZ: python doesn't
 struct: no RonaldsZ
 Nixerrr: Tunga Code of currently running competitions
 Nixerrr: So you'll be kicked from Ocean of Code if you post your code to a public repo
 Tunga: I aint even compete yet, I was just curious 
 Tunga: Thanks for the answer tho
 Tunga: pb4 are you a dota player/fan, your avatar is dota hero's picture: io
 pb4: wut&#160;?
 pb4: I don't know dota
 pb4: I'm crap at all those games
 AntiSquid: Tunga that's the codingame logo with blue background .
 pb4: ^
 Tunga: :D 
 Uljahn: stop being a dota fan and become a CG fan
 AntiSquid: and dota is super hard to play, if you don't have 7k MMR at least you're considered bad
 Tunga: Uljahn, I am not dota fan, I became code fan later on. I was a gamer like 20 years after quit completely
 Tunga: I was a semi-pro gamer, I dedicate so much time for that non-sense
 AntiSquid: i just don't understand "pro-gaming" these daysshit like clash royale is considered competitive, when it's pay to win
 Tunga: I was 5k when top pro players are like 7k 
 AntiSquid: 9k - 10k&#160;?
 Tunga: pro-gaming = if you gather money from playing 
 AntiSquid: i mean the top mmr of dota
 Tunga: After some time later, matchmaking gone completely nonsense and some players became 8k - 9k 
 AntiSquid: at the end of the day, playing in a team is completely different than solo
 Tunga: I dont know now but when I quit like 2 years ago, top players almost 10k in rate of mmr 
 Tunga: Playing with random team sucks because matchmaking fixing the games of yours as a lose or win with looking your previous games 
 Tunga: If you win 3 games in a row, you should expect a lose 
 Tunga: When I started the game, there is no mmr rates, there is only win rates like %55 
 Tunga: I was like %58, then mm gives you %43 wr teammates and make you lose against %52 %53's
 struct: I used to play lol
 struct: It was the same
 struct: but bigger win streaks
 Tunga: Then, fire nation attacked 
 struct: like 10 wins
 struct: 10 loses
 AntiSquid: you need to join hubs 
 Tunga: what is hubs?
 Tunga: LOL is started by a guy who is a partner of dota 1 
 Tunga: There were 3 guys at start 
 Tunga: Then it ll be 3 games, HON (which is lost the battle against other games), LOL and Dota
 struct: pb4 is it still the same code, sorry for ping
 Nixerrr: I'm a semi-pro wacky wheels player
 kovi: pb4, stop spamming, you are my nemesis and keep pushing me down&#160;:)
 mchl12: pb4, keep spamming, you are my saviour and keep pushing me up&#160;:)
 RoboStac: the top positions will all get reset in a few hours anyway when you change to silver
 RoboStac: so unless he's really pushing you down it shouldn't matter&#160;:)
 emh: Silver is at 18:00?
 pb4: I'm pushing everyone down :punch:
 pb4: :innocent:
 RoboStac: you aren't pushing me down!
 RoboStac: I'm safe in my not even in wood 3 yet place
 kovi: will you join robo?
 RoboStac: probably
 kovi: :ok_hand:
 pb4: mchl12&#160;: all my versions struggle against you&#160;:(
 pb4: submits can be very random
 pb4: I repushed the same version
 pb4: still 6th at 75% games done
 kovi: refresh is slow
 pb4: 3 elo difference between two submits with the same code :sweat_smile:
 struct: damn
 struct: 3 is a lot
 pb4: 3rd submit, same code
 pb4: I had 43.7 and 40.7
 kovi: as you plush me down more and more, you can get on me less and less&#160;;)
 kovi: gain
 pb4: sorry :sweat_smile:
 Tunga: How can he push you down? 
 Tunga: With getting more points&#160;?
 struct: if he beats he pushes them down
 Tunga: It is bot duel&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: His bot plays vs other players bots
 ForgottenDictator_3ce7: hi I'm a newcomer, I was wondering that if I can't solve a problem could I see the solution? Or I can only get stuck
 Nixerrr: You only get to see other people's solution if you solve the puzzle
 Nixerrr: However, you can ask for help here
 ForgottenDictator_3ce7: Got it! Thanks:grinning:
 emh: what? added one little timeout check and went from 12th to 50th.. hmm. or it's maybe too random..
 Scarfield: any idea how many will be let into silver when it opens?
 struct: 30% maybe?
 struct: Like 150 players
 Quidome: Is it allowed to use MOVE and SILENCE on the same turn?
 emh: Quidome yes
 struct: yes
 Quidome: interesting, thnxs&#160;:)
 kovi: looks better if i dont play vs. pb4&#160;:)
 Quidome: does a triggered mine set of another mine when it is 'damaged' by the explosion?
 Scarfield: nope
 Quidome: a pitty&#160;:(
 Scarfield: neither will a torpedo trigger a mine
 Scarfield: could be interesting though&#160;:)
 Quidome: we had this effect in the previous one ...
 yfprojects: that would give you more info about the opponent
 Quidome: When is the next league opening and on what for conditions?
 yfprojects: And the mine placement would have to be different
 Scarfield: if you click on the Bronze League, you can see the date of the next league opening
 Scarfield: i think the time is usually 18.00 paris time (?)
 Scarfield: so later today
 emh: are there any changes to rules scheduled?
 Scarfield: and no new rules after bronze
 emh: oh ok
 Quidome: where do you see that?
 emh: no mine nerfing?
 Illedan: No changes.
 Illedan: Only bug fixes
 Scarfield: Top of statement: Welcome to the Bronze league!
 Scarfield: in ille mentioned before&#160;:)
 Scarfield: Quidome in the top just by the count down
 Quidome: found it. thnxs
 Quidome: what are the conditions for entering?
 Quidome: silver
 Scarfield: getting a higher score than the player bot that is chosen as bronze boss
 Quidome: bronze boss is not active yet?
 Scarfield: el structo said it could be around top 150 silver bots instantly to silver, and the highest ranked player that isnt pushed to silver, will be set as boss for bronze
 Scarfield: well the bot that player has, the player will still participate as normal
 Quidome: Aha, nice system 
 struct: The player that is the boss is also promoted
 Scarfield: oh nice, didnt know that
 Quidome: so you don't have to fight your own written boss :D
 Scarfield: yea makes more sense that way&#160;:)
 emh: I'm at 100k limit now btw. gotta clean it up a bit. have some unused stuff. 3173 lines
 Quidome: :thumbsup:
 Quidome: 3000 lines i have only 350...
 Scarfield: but your lines are each 200 chars long :p
 Quidome: :sunglasses:
 Quidome: emh's bot is way better than mine. Have to write some more :P
 emh: hehe
 Andeagi: is there some kind of way to print messages to debug without having the game considering it an illegal move and doing SURFACE&#160;?
 Scarfield: what language are you using, you can error print, or add "|MSG debug stuff"
 [TK]: Andeagi&gt; fprintf(stderr,"debug message you like");
 Secundus: at what time does the silver league start?
 Andeagi: ok thx&#160;:)
 Scarfield: in 4 hours i think (?)
 Secundus: thx
 Secundus: almost 800 line of code and not even a single comment. thats surley how its supposed to be, right? xD  
 mchl12: Yup, that's how you do it
 MSmits: does the IDE work for you guys?
 Csipcsirip: nope
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: play my code does not work
 735487: no
 MSmits: ok, it's not just me then&#160;:)
 BeeGee: same
 emh: my submit stopped as well as IDE
 Astrobytes: yeah just got the same
 Ferris: me too, An error has occurred during compilation/execution
 ToshiTuringMachine: OupsAn error occurred (#510): "An error has occurred during compilation/execution.". Please contact codersHS@codingame.com
 Secundus: same
 ToshiTuringMachine: oh&#160;! also automaton is off?
 ToshiTuringMachine: world is falling apart
 Astrobytes: Pinged staff on discord
 Nixerrr: Automaton2000 AutomatoNN
 Automaton2000: imagine you have a good one
 Nixerrr: Just asleep
 Astrobytes: You missed an 'n' for NN
 Astrobytes: AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem with your bot?
 Nixerrr: Ah ok
 Nixerrr: They're annoying&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: 'n's in general or the bots? :D
 Nixerrr: haha the latter
 Astrobytes: lol, agreed
 Nixerrr: I'm a fan of thrice repeated consonants at the end of nicks as you can tell :D
 Astrobytes: haha true!
 AntiSquid: inivte spam me to clash of code = ban AutomatonNN
 MSmits: AutomatorRR
 AutomatonNN: good luck with that code
 Astrobytes: that has a good sound to it MSmits
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: how is your ooc bot Astrobytes?
 MSmits: I've only started to try and make silence work today
 AntiSquid: how do you enjoy the game MSmits?
 AntiSquid: is it good?
 MSmits: I like it yes, but I am not that far into it yet. Still working on tracking
 Astrobytes: 195th bronze, still just silences. Need to refactor some stuff and add... everything lol
 MSmits: got a long list
 MSmits: but taking it easy
 MSmits:  I worked on uttt earlier :P
 AntiSquid: i have rand()&#160;% 2 charge torpedo @Astrobytes
 Nixerrr: That's what I call persistence
 Nixerrr: MSmits
 Nixerrr: How long have you been tinkering with your uttt bot now?
 MSmits: years?
 Nixerrr: Nice
 MSmits: on and off 
 Nixerrr: You're my idol
 MSmits: this one should be nr 1 if i submit it, but I want to add some more things 
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid, I just removed the random stuff from my bot last night
 pb4: Do you have error 510 in IDE&#160;?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: yes pb4
 pb4: damn
 Astrobytes: yea, staff are on it pb4, reported on discord
 pb4: I wanted to test this feature...
 MSmits: would you have preferred if it was just you pb4?
 pb4: does it work when you submit&#160;?
 struct: submits stuck I think
 MSmits: dont think so
 struct: test it locally 
 Astrobytes: no, submits are frozen also
 struct: you have referee with viewer
 pb4: Ok
 pb4: Thanks
 struct: can play vs an old version of yours&#160;:)
 Zpooks: It's very active here, 'ello.
 MSmits: hi Zpooks
 pb4: Online&#160;? I'm not well versed in the setup of my own referee/viewer from the CG source
 AntiSquid: welcome to CG Zpooks, enjoy your stay
 pb4: Hi
 struct: nah, not online
 Zpooks: Haven't tried CG since university, solving these problems feel so different compared to day2day work.
 struct: but I think its working now pb4
 struct: ah not
 struct:  :(

 struct: Maybe submit old version
 struct: and then play new verssion vs the submited?
 struct: I think it should work if you are in a hurry
 AntiSquid: almost 1000 bots in the arena
 Astrobytes: Should be more by end of weekend, lots of people still busy with work
 AntiSquid: busy with wood2 boss
 Astrobytes: Is Wood2 boss hard? I slipped through when it was broken, annoyingly
 baltilius: Hi, am getting An error occurred (#510): "An error has occurred during compilation/execution.". Does anyone else experience this?
 WildSmilodon: Is anybody else seeing&#160;: "OupsAn error occurred (#510): "An error has occurred during ..." 
 YannT: yeah  I think we're all getting it
 Astrobytes: Yep baltilius, WildSmilodon, staff are working on it
 baltilius: okay Astrobytes, thanks 
 Astrobytes: np
 darkhorse64: Before it was nerfed with SURFACE every 50 turns, it was quite efficient at tracking you
 Astrobytes: Ah OK.
 Astrobytes: They nerfed Wood1 boss too I think right? I never had any problem with beating that one
 aangairbender: I am also getting #510 error
 TetraktysPhi: #510 compil: for several people indeed, CG is looking at
 aangairbender: and sometimes 73
 aangairbender: error #73
 TetraktysPhi: even for a default code, so it's not our code bt a platform pb
 wlesavo: working again
 emh: do we have to resubmit?
 wlesavo: oh nwm back to 73 error
 wlesavo: worked for a couple of runs
 Astrobytes: Progress! :P
 emh: submit completed
 Astrobytes: Yeah all seems to be up and running again now
 Zpooks: Hallelujah!
 icecream17: I made it to bronzer league overnight! Probably because i was 2nd
 icecream17: I finally escaped wood! 1st try! 374/432? oh no
 AntiSquid: top 10 promotion to silver
 AntiSquid: coz why not
 eulerscheZahl: wrong
 Illedan: Game updated
 wlesavo: yeah, it was unexpected seeing all those tooltips
 wlesavo: i wondered how we could survive all the damage :slight_smile:
 dbdr: hm, the last frame is still not visible?
 wlesavo: damn, now there are just too many tooltips
 Illedan: I did what everone wanted :P
 Illedan: It is dbdr?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442821096">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442821096</a>
 dbdr: I don't see a frame with me at 0
 dbdr: it appears and is immediately covered
 Illedan: in that replay you can see the torpedo hit
 Illedan: You couldn't do that earlier
 dbdr: 192 is covered
 Illedan: There is no action in 192
 dbdr: I see  the hit in 192
 dbdr: at 191 torpedo is charged
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/Z0Nunk.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/Z0Nunk.jpg</a>
 dbdr: are you seeing something different?
 Illedan: Chared at 191 and used
 Illedan: And then you see the explosion
 Illedan: and then you see endscreen
 dbdr: not in my screenshot
 Illedan: I see the same on 191 yes
 Illedan: 191 is the frame of the torpedo
 Illedan: 190 is the move
 Illedan: 192 is endscreen
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/G7EOoy.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/G7EOoy.jpg</a>
 dbdr: 191 torpedo charge is 3, so it's not fired yet
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/rnw3fb">https://prnt.sc/rnw3fb</a>
 dbdr: is that if you're fast enough eulerscheZahl?
 Illedan: I can see the full explosion before seeing endscreen
 Illedan: What speed are you playing it at?
 dbdr: I expected a frame you can stay on
 Illedan: 10x?
 dbdr: speed 0
 dbdr: arrows
 Illedan: Oh, you want even 1 more? :P
 dbdr: yeah I guess :D
 dbdr: really, when you analyze a situation, don't you do frame by frame?
 eulerscheZahl: when you pause and go step by step, you see the cell where an explosion happened, but instantly covered by the endscreen
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: I'll try to add one more
 dbdr: thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr just wants to see you break the engine
 dbdr: otheriwise, the life is removed at the right frame now, thanks for that!
 dbdr: the cover hiding the last frame is a problem on many games
 dbdr: I guess CG could fix it once for all by adding a special frame for it
 Illedan: ^
 Illedan: But wont happen this contest
 Illedan: Or even a button to hide it
 dbdr: no
 Illedan: I even let you submit in the contribution and you didn't let me know then&#160;:(
 dbdr: that was several hours later, didn't think it was relevant
 dbdr: and I still think it did not matter for that bug since the bug was before my bot even ran for that turn
 AntiSquid: so what changes are made apart from tooltips&#160;?
 dbdr: sorry if you missed the info
 AntiSquid: any changes regarding gameplay?
 Illedan: Nothing regarding gameplay
 eulerscheZahl: boss 2 change
 eulerscheZahl: wood2 that is
 Illedan: even though some bots broke, because they provide invalid input. 
 AntiSquid: and game will stay the same for the rest of the contest i hope? :p
 JFB: strange - my last battle is with marked silence  (it looks as old version - even length is 200 not 300) ...
 dbdr: maybe old matches?
 JFB: No - last one - 1 min ago
 eulerscheZahl: "200 not 300"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 300 what?
 eulerscheZahl: can you share a replay?
 JFB: steps
 Illedan: 2 MSG is not longer allowed and an empty MSG is noth either
 JFB: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442821581">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442821581</a>
 dbdr: MSG eval(\'winner = \"dbdr\"\')
 eulerscheZahl: you timed out
 dbdr: for MSG??
 dbdr: isn't that free form?
 JFB: But why they are SILENCE marked - not only life losts?
 Illedan: Some players usedMOVE N|MSG YOLO|SILENCE N 4|MSG MORE YOLO
 eulerscheZahl: because the poll said that users want more tooltips
 eulerscheZahl: personally i voted for only life losses in the tooltips
 dbdr: so now the people who don't will complain&#160;:/
 dbdr: *some people
 AntiSquid: of course
 JFB: OK - so it is ew change, right, just innow?
 AntiSquid: the others would also complain if they wouldn't get what they want
 dbdr: exactly
 AntiSquid: so it's only reasonable to complain
 dbdr: non sequitur
 JFB: OK - it looks just stragne - game 5 min ago was without silence - now is with. But Ok - if ppl like it ...
 AntiSquid: maybe some don't even understand what they voted for, happens a lot in the real world
 dbdr: oh yes...
 JFB: For me it is not a problem - simply wants to know do it is bug or feature&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://strawpoll.com/47cd8f4a/r">https://strawpoll.com/47cd8f4a/r</a>
 Illedan: Let's see if we suddenly get 15 votes for Life only :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: there's a reason why i linked to the results directly, not the poll
 eulerscheZahl: but i see you can get back and vote
 wlesavo: if you didnot yet
 Illedan: I can't vote again
 dbdr: I like how CG designed tooltips to be yellow on a yellow background (for past ones)
 eulerscheZahl: i set the checkmark to only allow 1 vote per IP
 dbdr: orange on yellow, at most
 eulerscheZahl: UTTT tooltips :rolling_eyes:
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: I think I even reported that as a bug on github for uTTT
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan don't forget to update <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code</a>
 dbdr: why is it related to uTTT?
 Zenoscave: new league today!!!
 eulerscheZahl: i still prefer the blue vs yellow over red vs orange. despite invisible tooltips
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not colorblind, but some games make it really hard
 Zenoscave: 20 min from now yes?
 dbdr: blue vs red would fix it, no?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: 20 min - 20 min + 4 hours
 Zenoscave: bah
 dbdr: confidence interval
 eulerscheZahl: why 20min? 1h 20min i think
 dbdr: right
 Zenoscave: was past contests always at 4PM UTC&#160;? I may be rememberin incorectly
 eulerscheZahl: 6pm french time
 eulerscheZahl: changing to daylight saving time will be on this weekend
 AntiSquid: they could promote people to new league without resubmitting, then there would be less lag, but maybe this is wishful thinking :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, your wishes are getting ridiculous
 dbdr: league is not that big
 JFB: So silver league is open?
 Zenoscave: pb3+1 is wrecking
 dbdr: only CSB is a big problem no?
 AntiSquid: it still lags dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: but yet JFB
 AntiSquid: always lag, even with 100 promotions
 Zenoscave: 1h18m
 JFB: OK 
 dbdr: lags what? IDE matches have priority over submits
 Illedan: Zenoscave, yeah wala got broken because of that MSG killer
 Zenoscave: MSG killer?
 Illedan: He prints 2 MSG on double command turns
 AntiSquid: what was the issue with MSG&#160;?
 Zenoscave: ouch
 dbdr: MINE N|MSG MINE BEFORE|MOVE E SILENCE|MSG SILENCE SIMPLE MOVE
 AntiSquid: i don't see the issue with that, does some of it get sent to the enemy&#160;?
 dbdr: two MSG
 Illedan: No, but after refactorization it is no longer valid
 Illedan: But I see it as a good idea
 dbdr: yes, two MSG make no sense
 Illedan: I'll let players set their message&#160;:)
 Illedan: twice
 Illedan: To change msg between commands
 Illedan: Show the first one found first
 dbdr: ah, yes, with frames it does make sese
 Illedan: Then swap between commands
 Illedan: Easy to fix now  after refactorization :rocket:
 AntiSquid: locam had message after every card move (not saying it's smart, but no issue there imo)
 dbdr: but it does not introduce a new frame right?
 Illedan: nope
 dbdr: cool
 dbdr: kovi #1
 dbdr: ah, pb3+1 in resub
 pb4: coming
 dbdr: still gg for kovi, improved recently
 Zenoscave: pb4 you have timeout against me
 Zenoscave: want replay?
 pb4: Yes please
 pb4: this push&#160;?
 pb4: If it's from 30minutes ago, I fixed the bug
 Zenoscave: It was recent but I'm not sure which.
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442821328">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442821328</a>
 Zenoscave: just in case
 pb4: Yep
 pb4: this one is fixed&#160;:)
 pb4: Thanks
 Zenoscave: of course&#160;:+1:
 kovi: wow, this time pb4 pushed me up
 pb4: dat randomness though
 pb4: Previous push went tup to 43 elo
 dbdr: are there more games in silver?
 dbdr: or just gold?
 Zenoscave: yeah you were killining it
 pb4: Repushed the same code, stuck around 38 elo at 60%, but it won't ever get first
 JFB: Wow - 1000 players&#160;:-)
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: pb4, wala giving you some free elo
 Zenoscave: gz Illedan and eulerscheZahl
 Zenoscave: and G-Rom

 wala: Thanks Illedan . I've fixed my bug
 eulerscheZahl: you've worked around the referee bug/breaking change
 mlomb: Maybe the actions could be in a darker color than the life lostI will be easier to tell apart while scrubbing
 eulerscheZahl: that's not that simple with the SDK
 Illedan: Don't think that is possible no&#160;:(
 mlomb: :S nvm then
 eulerscheZahl: you only tell that there's an event affecting a given playerand define the player color in some config
 kovi: what was fixed?
 kovi: (btw, i also liked the life loosing marks better)
 eulerscheZahl: and no way to add extra dummy players for more colors without breaking something else
 Illedan: That is possible eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: no Illedan, would screw up elsewhere
 Illedan: Ofc, but I wonder if we did from the start :P
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. 4 players in selection, even if only 2 get to play
 eulerscheZahl: did you vote for the tooltips kovi?
 kovi: where?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://strawpoll.com/47cd8f4a/r">https://strawpoll.com/47cd8f4a/r</a>
 eulerscheZahl: community decided
 wala: kovi you can't print multiple messages (that was my bug. it was working yesterday)
 kovi: oh i c
 kovi: multiple msg? that is op
 Illedan: I will add it because wala makes sense
 kovi: definitely need the nerf
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: oh, you can change the player colors using the SDK?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: config has playerColors
 struct: yes
 kovi: nice submit zenoscave
 dbdr: I guess this is the default
 struct: yellow red are default for 
 Zenoscave: thanks
 dbdr: seem pretty familiar
 struct: yes, most of multies use these colors
 struct: even CSB 
 Illedan: I'll be off 1 hour. Let me know on discord if anything :fire:
 Illedan: bye
 Zenoscave: bye bye
 ZarthaxX: holy Zenoscave nice rank
 ZarthaxX: this is your tshirt time
 Zenoscave: THERE ARE TSHIRTS!?!?!?!
 eulerscheZahl: are there tshirts this time?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 ZarthaxX: no..
 aangairbender: in no tshirt contest
 ZarthaxX: idk
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Zenoscave: noooooooooooo
 eulerscheZahl: not revealed yet, if there is anything to win
 Zenoscave: don't mess with a man's heart like that
 dbdr: masks
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud said here on the chat "we'll find something"that's all i know
 struct: :pray: 
 struct: I still need to get legend&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave wants that shirt?
 Zenoscave: very much
 ZarthaxX: they will send masks
 ZarthaxX: and alcohol 
 eulerscheZahl: we are anonymous
 Zenoscave: I think he means masks for the virus eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: yes
 ZarthaxX: thanks for the clarification lmao
 eulerscheZahl: noalcohol =&gt; anonymous alcoholics
 Zenoscave: ohhhhh
 Zenoscave: thanks for the clarification as well
 ZarthaxX: i just wanted to help zeno with his little problem..
 Zenoscave: broken submit pb4?
 pb4: Yup
 pb4: I'm refactoring my sublime text and testing stuff in CG IDE
 pb4: I was a bit hasty in submitting the CG IDE code :D
 Zenoscave: oops
 pb4: It's back
 pb4: without the off-by-one error...
 eulerscheZahl: so hiding doesn't start today?
 struct: it starts on day 1
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: it starts tomorrow, but maybe someone has an off by one on the date
 Zenoscave: you have packages for sublime text?
 Zenoscave: pb3+1
 pb4: Yup
 Zenoscave: any published?
 pb4: uh&#160;?
 Zenoscave: on package control
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://packagecontrol.io/">https://packagecontrol.io/</a>
 pb4: Yes, all
 Zenoscave: cool
 pb4: sublimerge, clang format, easyclang complete, sublimelinter, etc..
 wlesavo: so when does tryharding starts
 pb4: yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: we'll see people battling for the top till the last weekend
 blasterpoard: 20 minutes before the deadline, I guess
 eulerscheZahl: blasterpoard has bad memories&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: wlesavo nice submit
 blasterpoard: nah, I just went for cheese that time instead of playing properly
 blasterpoard: and made #4 bot overnight when it didn't work in the end xD
 eulerscheZahl: you image was not a cheese
 wlesavo: Zenoscave some mine escaping, still quite random
 AntiSquid: hardened tofu boards
 Zenoscave: mine escaping. smart idea
 wlesavo: basically i estimate possible damage for a move
 blasterpoard: btw when will you guys start surfacing before silence when fighting?
 Zenoscave: wdym blasterpoard
 wlesavo: dont think its always a good idea, just removed that
 AntiSquid: he wants you to surface and then silence
 Zenoscave: that sound like bad idea
 Zenoscave: or as an escape mechanism?
 blasterpoard: local testing says it's actually very good
 blasterpoard: gives over 70% winrate vs bot that doesn't do it
 blasterpoard: ofc not always
 Zenoscave: My bot just blindly moves. no escaping/attacking yet
 wlesavo: i used to silence right after surface for watever reason
 Gajowy: can you just stay in the same place forever and only use the torpedo?
 Zenoscave: Try it
 blasterpoard: Gajowy no, you need to charge abilities by moving
 kovi: im sure everyone will surface
 Zenoscave: don't try it
 kovi: i just didnt wanted to start
 kovi: till last day
 blasterpoard: that is gold stuff, not legend stuff
 kovi: true
 wlesavo: i tried to use surface to escape minefields, but its kinda hard to balance
 dbdr: Zenoscave you're #15 with just moving no attacking?
 struct: I  say replays of him using torpedos and mines
 struct: I see*
 Zenoscave: yes 
 Zenoscave: I mean I don't target my movements toward any point 
 Zenoscave: I still torpedo
 wlesavo: struct yeah, also just went to check that there are attacks :slight_smile:
 Zenoscave: I mean I don't move toward opponent on purpose
 wlesavo: i used do target moves, but it looks like a bad idea in general, only if for some finishing blows
 Zenoscave: Kinda stuck on what to add next
 wlesavo: do you track mine history for trigger filtering?
 egaetan: Illedan my Bit is suddenly broken
 emh: ohh.. full replay line is back I see
 Zenoscave: trigger filtering?
 egaetan: the gormat for MINE has changed&#160;?
 emh: and I got used to the new sparse one
 Zenoscave: egaetan only one MSG 
 Zenoscave: Mine only takes one arg
 Zenoscave: just N/E/S/W
 wlesavo: Zenoscave when opponent triggers a mine you can tell if some candidates were around that possition
 egaetan: ok time to correct and resub
 Zenoscave: Oh yeah I do that
 kovi: oh, i start 3 days ago, i totally missed the old one
 wlesavo: or if they couldnt ever plant there
 Zenoscave: I use it for finding their location only though. no mine avoiding
 wlesavo: well estimation of damage is pretty simple if you track mines, but i dunno how to optimally implement it in strategy
 wlesavo: egaetan what was the old format? 
 egaetan: i wrote MINE DIR MINE
 wlesavo: oh ok
 emh: I'm still at my father's house. finding delicacies in fridge room like beer expired 1998. today's special a 1.25 l Christmas beer expired 2002 or so. celebrating Silver
 emh: prematurely
 Astrobytes: I like your style emh
 AntiSquid: well aged lol
 emh: thanks&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: any army food in there? lol
 emh: we have 3 freezers. mostly self-fished seafood
 eulerscheZahl: remember to call the museum when it gets older
 AntiSquid: stuff like this is what i mean:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjZicBu_2Y4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjZicBu_2Y4</a>
 Astrobytes: I only recently threw away my emergency food and water rations as they expired (used to do a fair bit hiking and stuff)
 AntiSquid: there's videos of people opening really old army food boxes and trying them out :D
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i want to click that link
 AntiSquid: canned / pasteurised / powdered 
 Ayo35: kareem
 emh: cool AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ok that wasn't best example, there are some better preserved ones
 kovi: time?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/vkWM6mz_JVo?t=988">https://youtu.be/vkWM6mz_JVo?t=988</a> he tastes peanut butter from 1957 
 emh: hehe
 Astrobytes: Imagine he found some ancient surströmming or lutefisk... would be some video
 emh: yay!
 mlomb: new league!
 Astrobytes: woop
 emh: inoory is Bronze boss?
 eulerscheZahl: promoted!
 eulerscheZahl: better than captain Nemo
 dbdr: oh, a completely new top
 eulerscheZahl: my first match directly vs kovi
 eulerscheZahl: great start :D
 emh: euler same&#160;:)
 dbdr: great choice of opponents
 kovi: but emh won
 emh: yup hehe&#160;:) luck
 emh: and a loss now kovi
 emh: how many matches will there be now in Silver?
 emh: 32 at 6%
 emh: so 500? I guess the percentage lags a little
 emh: though
 BenjaminUrquhart: silver opened and I'm not in it
 BenjaminUrquhart: sad
 BenjaminUrquhart: time to fix thigns
 BenjaminUrquhart: things*
 AntiSquid: fix it&#160;! :D
 kovi: where is dbdr?
 AntiSquid: lol some submitted after silver opened, they wreck the boss and mass promote
 dbdr: i'm here&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: asking for extra frames AntiSquid
 kovi: is there a different meta in current top?
 BenjaminUrquhart: kovi
 dbdr: #15 at 23%
 BenjaminUrquhart: my submits stopped
 BenjaminUrquhart: hm
 dbdr: I think it's not stabilized yet
 dbdr: wait for the end of the submits
 dbdr: wala is #23 right now
 kovi: wow
 dbdr: again, not significant yet
 jrke: int(j)
 jrke:&#160;;
 BenjaminUrquhart: yay I found tracking bugs
 pb4: how is wala so low&#160;?!
 JFB: He has bug? 
 BenjaminUrquhart: leaderboard is unstable
 emh: or he doing limbo
 BenjaminUrquhart: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero"found the bug, not sure how this happened but ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: theoretically I should never be dividing by zero but I guess some edge case breaks it
 wlesavo: so who is the bronze boss?
 BenjaminUrquhart: unsure
 BenjaminUrquhart: definitely isn't me
 JFB: Maybe eulerscheZahl hnows&#160;?
 JFB: *knows
 eulerscheZahl: i don't
 JFB: Why???
 eulerscheZahl: i only know that it was planned to rank around 200
 wlesavo: but at some point we will know that?
 eulerscheZahl: because it wasn't communicated on the private discord server, that simple
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 dbdr: silver: exactly 200 ppl&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: take a guess who it is, then play user vs boss in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know what languages the boss uses
 BenjaminUrquhart: bronze boss is getting rekt
 wlesavo: boss should be with a fixed seed for sure, right?
 BenjaminUrquhart: python3
 wlesavo: otherwise it would be not very convinient
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh eulerscheZahl can we still break the game by using SILENCE 69
 eulerscheZahl: deterministic bosses are highly preferred
 eulerscheZahl: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thumbsup:
 emh: right after Silver opened I saw inoory just below boss with exact same score as boss. dunno if that's an indication. is he python3?
 JFB: SILENCE 69 - it looks as a name of porno film&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: lol, better than Silence of the Clams I suppose
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442878472">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442878472</a>
 emh: well they both start at 7,7 at least, but probably a lot of people do
 emh: inoryy is it you? are you Bronze boss? how can we know? what does the fox say?
 eulerscheZahl: try twice with swapped starting positions emh
 eulerscheZahl: on the same map
 AntiSquid: ocean of silence 69
 emh: both games end at turn 50. 1 0 vs 0 1
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442880417">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442880417</a> vs <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442878472">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442878472</a>
 emh: inoryy is Bronze boss looks like
 eulerscheZahl: boss exposed
 wlesavo: heh, that was fast detection
 AntiSquid: it's not a strong boss so whatever
 eulerscheZahl: it's the bronze boss
 AntiSquid: i mean it's not a higher league boss 
 dbdr: it's practice in Boss hunting
 Waffle3z: how often do new leagues get released in the 10-day contests?
 eulerscheZahl: every 2 days
 dbdr: every 2 days
 AntiSquid: every 3 days
 wlesavo: 2 people alredy broke bronze carantine
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: monday, wednesday, friday
 eulerscheZahl: cintest from frida to monday
 eulerscheZahl: contest
 Astrobytes: who's Frida? :P
 AntiSquid: tante Frida
 eulerscheZahl: the nanny from ducktales
 dbdr: Kahlo
 emh: tante means aunt in Norwegian
 Astrobytes: ducktales omg 
 dbdr: and french emh
 emh: ohh
 AntiSquid: and german
 dbdr: you speach french AND watch Kaameloot AntiSquid??
 AntiSquid: what
 AntiSquid: where did that come from?
 dbdr: then it's a coincidence :D
 dbdr: who's tante friday for you?
 dbdr: there, reverse mistake
 Astrobytes: hehe
 eulerscheZahl: hm, in the English version Frieda is called Mrs Beakley
 Astrobytes: Correct
 eulerscheZahl: did you recognize the German name of her?
 AntiSquid: that's personal dbdr
 dbdr: ok
 Astrobytes: yea, I used to work with some German guys
 Astrobytes: Not that we sat around watching Duck Tales much but 
 Astrobytes: y'know
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 Astrobytes: That's how I got into Rammstein
 AntiSquid: i see rammstein more like a good source for memes
 Astrobytes: They're epic live
 muy31: Is anyone else's code over 1000 lines?
 wlesavo: i did, just slightly over
 wlesavo: emh had 2700+
 muy31: It's really annoying to continuously scroll
 AntiSquid: i have  &lt; 500 lines and i didn't refactor
 muy31: isnt it
 emh: wlesavo yes 3188 now
 eulerscheZahl: i decided to split my bot into multiple files
 muy31: you can do that?
 muy31: im using java, so that would help
 dbdr: you can NOT do that?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, and a script to merge them into a single one
 Astrobytes: as long as you recombine them into 1 file for CG yeah
 muy31: oh
 eulerscheZahl: for java there is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cgfilemerge-merge-multi-file-workspace-into-one-cg-conform-file/168545/2">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cgfilemerge-merge-multi-file-workspace-into-one-cg-conform-file/168545/2</a>
 AntiSquid: muy depends what IDE you use, but usually (including CG IDE) there's tiny arrows on the right side and you can collapse the functions
 Astrobytes: There's a Java one in the forum
 muy31: i thought multiple files in CG
 eulerscheZahl: just run it as a post build event
 Astrobytes: damn euler, beat me to it
 eulerscheZahl: hah :D
 wlesavo: wow, robo joined
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 Kathrin: what's going on, my totally stupid code ended 10th in wood yesterday, and was promoted to bronze this morning and just a minute ago to silver.  Guess, if I do nothing, I'm legend by the end of the contest 
 eulerscheZahl: wood boss replaced, was too strong
 eulerscheZahl: always hard to choose the right skill without having lots of users to compare to
 eulerscheZahl: even harder with the short preparation time
 dbdr: hard boss + nerf later seems ideal to me
 eulerscheZahl: especially for a longer contest
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise bronze would have been huge
 Kathrin: I think I will not rely on my luck and  boss nerfs, Time to learn the seek part of "hide and seek"
 eulerscheZahl: that's easier than hiding

 Pedro1994: Hi, quick question do you know what I should take to do GUI  for c++ (I use eclipse but I can change, Qt seem fine but its not free)
 Astrobytes: coin coin
 Zenoscave: For the love of god don't do GUI in C++
 Zenoscave: unless it is required
 eulerscheZahl: qt is not free?
 Zenoscave: basic parts are
 Astrobytes: It's.... messy
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">https://www.qt.io/download-open-source</a>
 wizzwizz4: QtEditor seemed at least gratis last I checked.
 Pedro1994: there is a free trial but i dont know the limitations
 Zenoscave: I believe wizzwizz4
 Zenoscave: is right*
 muy31: i cannot believe that this entire time i never checked if where i am firing my torpedo passed through an island
 muy31: so how do you check that anyway?
 AntiSquid: uhm lol&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: pathfinding
 AntiSquid:&#160;!!
 muy31: ZarthaxX I'm sure that is way to complicate for that
 muy31: *way too
 muy31: complicated
 AntiSquid: it's more like you have to check it that way
 Astrobytes: muy31 it should have been obvious from the image no?
 muy31: can you torpedo around corners?
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442903913">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442903913</a>
 muy31: move 54
 eulerscheZahl: there's even an image in the statement to show where you can shoot
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/torpedoRange.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/torpedoRange.png</a>
 muy31: oh yeah forgot
 eulerscheZahl: thank you Astrobytes
 muy31: still, pathfinding seems unnecessary for just that
 Wishmaster_89: can't pass through islands
 muy31: that instance barely happens
 eulerscheZahl: but it does happen
 Astrobytes: ...
 eulerscheZahl: and screws up your tracking when you expect the opponent to take damage
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: so i timed out next turn
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know what to say...
 muy31: when opponent was "nowhere on the map"
 wlesavo: muy31 you can also lose candidates thinking they could not fire through the island
 muy31: candidates?
 wlesavo: possible positions
 eulerscheZahl: possible opponent positions
 muy31: oh
 muy31: well no, i see max of 4 steps

 NeevShah: HELLO
 NeevShah: :grinning:
 derjack: good morning
 Jirikora: good afternoon from here
 Thorcode: good afternoon too
 Benji-the-scripter: Hello. Day 4 of almost no coding knowledge
 Thorcode: hi benji
 Uljahn: well spent
 Benji-the-scripter: Uljahn some friends of me is respecting you very much
 Thorcode: well I have almost all day full of new coding knowledge
 Benji-the-scripter: cool
 Thorcode: cuz there is a book
 Thorcode: that.........................
 Benji-the-scripter: good book?
 Thorcode: yeah
 Benji-the-scripter: where to buy
 Benji-the-scripter:&#160;?
 Thorcode: you could download it online
 Benji-the-scripter: cool
 Thorcode: or print it
 Benji-the-scripter: where?
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf">http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf</a>
 Thorcode: here
 Benji-the-scripter: thx i will read it later
 Benji-the-scripter: that was a f***ing muc bit of knowledge
 Benji-the-scripter: much*
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: "a bit" knowledge
 Benji-the-scripter: a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig bit of knowledge
 Thorcode: benji
 Thorcode: could you help me 
 raizbro: hi
 Benji-the-scripter: hi
 Prat030154: hi
 raizbro: hi
 raizbro: hi
 Thorcode: stop say hi guys
 raizbro: ok
 Prat030154: ok
 Anth: ok
 raizbro: guys dont spam
 raizbro: pk
 Trevodorax: ok
 Kobzar: hi
 raizbro: hi thor code
 Uljahn: I think your time could be better spent if you focused more on problem solving rather than mindlessly chilling in the chat. This site is dedicated to practicing coding after all. Keep in mind that flooding the chat with nonsense won't make you a better coder.
 Thorcode: Uljahn is cool
 Thorcode: you almost in legend legue of any bot compitition
 Uljahn: mostly gold, im not a pro coder, also im on python
 Thorcode: almost my bot solo see you in legend
 Thorcode: well I gotta beat you in someday
 Uljahn: beating a cat is animal abuse :crying_cat_face:
 Thorcode: no this cat is magic thor is going to beat it
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AptClosedDavidstiger-mobile.mp4">https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AptClosedDavidstiger-mobile.mp4</a>
 Thorcode: in someday not today :grin:
 Havertz19: :sunglasses:
 Thorcode: nice jacek
 Uljahn: (â•¯Â°â–¡Â°ï¼‰â•¯ï¸µ:popcorn:
 Thorcode: well thor is going to beat the cat with meow meow
 Benji-the-scripter: cat is going to win! Uljahn are best
 therealbeef: am i the only one being a bit disappointed by the fall contest?
 jacek: just a bit?
 therealbeef: im trying to stay nice in chat
 Uljahn: my disappointing is immeasurable and my fall is ruined :crying_cat_face:
 jacek: :head_bandage:
 therealbeef: how do you win those escape games? best time, or best score?
 [CG]Thibaud: your score is time + hints used
 therealbeef: time since start of the contest or time using the website?
 [CG]Thibaud: since start
 [CG]Thibaud: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/coding-escape-events">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/coding-escape-events</a>
 raxkin: this will be the unique fall challange? there will not be a contest like the last one? i'm a bit disapointed
 therealbeef: from the discord channel I understood that it is even unclear whether next year's contests will be bot programming or not
 dbf: I hope that CG is just testing new formats not having some real issues with budgets/etc to run contests as we used to have :disappointed:
 raxkin: I think it's easier for them to implement a bot programing challange than a escape challange that takes 168h aprox
 derjack: escape from CG, thats the challenge
 raxkin: So i gues they are testing or tring to marketing the escape challanges as there is some paid content there
 raizbro: what is happen
 [CG]Thibaud: no budget issue dbf don't worry, testing the concept mainly
 [CG]Thibaud: raxkin no, it's easier to create a Coding Escape than a bot programming game
 Benji-the-scripter: how do i complet second AI quest so i understand coding a little bit more
 [CG]Thibaud: try this the other way around Benji-the-scripter
 [CG]Thibaud: understand coding first, then do the quest
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 botacoda: hello guys
 Benji-the-scripter: hello
 botacoda: which is the trending and the best language?
 emilt: Subjective or google statistics
 Wontonimo: hey botacoda, what kind of job are you intersted in&#160;?
 SabertheLost: why replace the fall challange with an escape room that 'requires a team?
 Wontonimo: for business applications it is&#160;: java, php, javascript
 Wontonimo: for machine learning it's python, c++
 Wontonimo: for game dev, c++, c#, javascript (if browser based)
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: no time to learn the basics, just jump on the hype train! :scream_cat:
 Automaton2000: do you mean the one in the statement
 Benji-the-scripter: hellÃ¶
 Benji-the-scripter: (hello)
 Uljahn: DRY
 Benji-the-scripter:&#160;?
 Uljahn: don't repeat yourself
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 DerMert: Yo
 ivanmusa: omg
 DerMert: I need help
 DerMert: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: :nerd: 
 Erossi: yo whats up?
 DerMert: not much how bout u
 Erossi: yea can't complain bro
 Erossi: been chillin
 Erossi: what kind of help do you need?
 DerMert: with java
 DerMert: sudoku validator
 Erossi: where you stuck at?
 DerMert: the first one xD
 Erossi: ohh
 DerMert: ion understand java that much
 Erossi: Just got into programming?
 DerMert: ive been programming with c# for a while and now we switched to java its confusing
 Erossi: Oh i see 
 Erossi: thats good then
 Erossi: so you kinda need help with syntaxes&#160;?
 DerMert: yea like the commands and shiiii
 DerMert: how do i check if a whole line has the numbers 1-9 without duplicates
 Erossi: use range in a loop I'd suggest
 Wontonimo: one way&#160;: if you have an array of 9 booleans, go through each square and check off the corresponding boolean as you see the number
 Wontonimo: if the boolean is already set ... there is a duplicate
 DerMert: aha ok
 Wontonimo: the python way would be to make a set.  check that each element isn't yet in the set before adding it
 ivanmusa: you mean set kind of like an hashset in java?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: tbh, a boolean array will be way faster
 ivanmusa: yeah would work too but i think ill do the hashset bc i used it too in c#
 DerMert: we have a 2dimensional array, its a sudoku field and we have to check if some numbers are duplicate
 Wontonimo: using hashset is like using a combine harvester to pick 2 tomatoes.  
 ivanmusa: i love you brother wontonimo
 Gussaci: I'm back bitches 
 marejvnc: Hhaahhaha
 Gussaci: How u doin??
 DerMert: guuuuurl is that u??
 Gussaci: Yaaasss
 DerMert: o ma gad gurl i missd uuu
 Gussaci: Sammmmmeeeee
 Uljahn: use DM guys
 Wontonimo: keep it coding or codingame related.  generally stay on topic.  be respectful.
 Gussaci: No sir
 Wontonimo: I made a channel for you.  Click here #cooldudes
 Wontonimo: it's your own private channel
 DerMert: oh hahahah thank you &lt;333333333333333
 hamzaargoubi: xD
 Westicles: or just use the friends channel #fr
 Wontonimo: no, that's french&#160;! not friends
 Wontonimo: lol
 Westicles: oh, oups
 alowaniak: Finally in top 100 of CoC, only took me over 1K participations ðŸ˜…
 Wontonimo: congrats
 Wontonimo: now graduate to puzzles and bot battles
 derjack: now do the clash of bots
 alowaniak: Yea I should probably do those, but for some reason I always gravitate back to the CoCI think they generate more dopamine for me
 derjack: so does meth
 Gussaci: I know u didn't
 Wontonimo: if you can do flood-fill, tron <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tron-battle">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tron-battle</a> is a good bot battle.
 Wontonimo: connect 4 is super easy to start in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4</a> 
 DerMert: i know you lyin
 Wontonimo: prbly wrong channel DerMert, try #cooldudes
 DerMert: oh sorry
 Wontonimo: alowaniak , space shooter is really fun and really easy to get into <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/space-shooter">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/space-shooter</a>
 Wontonimo: pew pew
 Gussaci: I know u just didn't talk to my gurl like this 
 Gussaci: U better ask somebody about me!
 Astrobytes: Keep your nonsense in your own channel or get kicked.
 Astrobytes: Ban next time. And quit the DMs
 ivanmusa: what is the difference between int and Integer in java
 ivanmusa: sorry if i noob
 Wontonimo: that's a good question
 Wontonimo: int is a "primitive".  
 Wontonimo: it is just that, a number
 Wontonimo: Integer is an object.  it has all the things objects have
 Wontonimo: and you can subclass it
 ivanmusa: ohhhh
 ivanmusa: thank u
 DerMert: noob ivan
 ivanmusa: :cry:
 DerMert: :nerd:
 alowaniak: Thanks for the recommendations @Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: let me know which one you start on if you do.  The bot battles that give you a list of valid next moves are the easiest to create a random bot to get started.
 raizbro: hi
 raizbro: guys see thorcode
 raizbro: hi
 raizbro:&#160;!
 alowaniak: hi
 Coder_noob001: printf("hi");
 alowaniak: So how do the bot battles work? Does it do like 100rounds or something?
 Thorcode: what does pip do?
 raizbro: like poop
 raizbro: :joy: :joy:
 Uljahn: raizbro last warning
 raizbro: what
 derjack: alowaniak depends on the game. the usual - bot gets input the prints the output per turn. there are up to 600(?) turns
 Thorcode: well raizbro almost die&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: :wave: Thorcode
 Thorcode: hi
 Thorcode: well
 Thorcode: what is the interest of bank
 Wontonimo: google can tell you all about pip.  google "pip package manager"
 Thorcode: well
 Thorcode: I finished it
 Wontonimo: bank?
 Thorcode: yeah
 Wontonimo: maybe you are not the Thorcode I know.
 Thorcode: in coc it have a stupid clash need to caculate money
 Thorcode: oh
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: that makes sense then
 Wontonimo: i don't help with Clash, sorry.  Try google.  If it were a puzzle, or bot, no problem.  I don't have anything against Clash, it's just the time crunch makes it really hard to help
 Thorcode: well I'm ther Thorcode you know
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: oh it is so simple
 Uljahn: always try to search the answer first, it's not very interesting to answer questions you can resolve yourself in 15 sec
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 Thorcode: Uljahn how could you have a moderator badge in chat
 Astrobytes: Thorcode stop it please.
 Astrobytes: (DM'd me the same)
 Uljahn: Thorcode: i guess you can get some ideas here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/moderation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/moderation</a>
 Miki09: Is there any way I could unlock other coding escape missions without being in any company?
 eulerscheZahl: afaik: not yet, might be possible in the future
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm not actively following their progress on this, just what i remember from someone asking on the forum
 derjack: you know more than me
 Astrobytes: Liked that rapid disclaimer there euler :D
 eulerscheZahl: like: "how can I do &lt;weird thing&gt;? asking for a friend"
 Astrobytes: hehehe yep
 eulerscheZahl: i think their countdown is wrong. there's daylight saving time change between now and the event.
 eulerscheZahl: for the contest
 Astrobytes: Maybe that's part of it. Gotta figure out the right start time (needs no coding skills :P )
 wlesavo: hehe finally got my coif legend
 TimothyAlexisVass: congratulations
 eulerscheZahl: python heuristics?
 Astrobytes: eyyy gratz&#160;:)
 Uljahn: gratz
 wlesavo: yeah no search, just a banch of heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: wow, there's a python at #3&#160;:
 eulerscheZahl: :o
 wlesavo: i think complexity-wise coif legend quite similar to OOC, at least my code also have 1k+ lines and similar stuff with predicting opponents cuts and fatalities
 eulerscheZahl: COIF is one of my largest bots
 eulerscheZahl: last fall challenge(?) - the cooking witches - is by far my smallest among the more recent ones
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that annoying neighbour. he's testing the bell on his bicycle once again be repeatedly ringing it. why would anyone do this?
 Thorcode: They want to prank you?
 Thorcode: he
 CodingWizardAI: Does anyone want to join a "coding escape" challenge?
 Ari24-cb24: whats a coding escape challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: just say "yes" and you will see
 CodingWizardAI: Its difficult to explain
 CodingWizardAI: its like a mix between a coding challenge and an escape room
 CodingWizardAI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/PXb-H85-gBf-t7a">https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/PXb-H85-gBf-t7a</a>
 Ari24-cb24: Sounds fun, I'll give it a try! tyty ^^
 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we should try this with our next chat trolls: just invite them to an escape room?
 Astrobytes: inescapable room would be better
 eulerscheZahl: i was thinking about making a puzzle a while ago (somehow i didn't)would have been part of the story: your co-worker did something. but unfortunately he got stuck in one of codingames escape rooms, so you have to figure out what exactly he did
 eulerscheZahl: the blackbox wiring where you have to toggle switches to turn on specific lights
 Astrobytes: I remember you were going to make a puzzle with that kind of mechanic, didn't know you had a theme too lol
 eulerscheZahl: in the end those puzzles are too much effort for a handful of players
 Ari24-cb24: ouh
 wlesavo: minesweeper was really cool
 eulerscheZahl: my main problem is the low visibility. it's just on the same page with 100 other puzzles. hard to stand out and get seen, even for a high-quality puzzle. they are just sorted by age
 eulerscheZahl: 1935 community contributions approved, including clashes. soon we'll hit the 2000 mark
 eulerscheZahl: and at 10000 my herokuapp will stop working (row limitation of free databse)
 struct: lol
 struct: I dont think it will happen
 eulerscheZahl: before we hit 10k, CG will change their API and I won't find motivation to rewrite my parser
 struct: have you added escapes to it yet?
 Westicles: you can delete the deactivated ones
 jrke: make a lookup table for those contribution and update them in regularly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Westicles: oh, 10k limit not 2k
 eulerscheZahl: i'm only indexing user contributions. not even official puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: i could just stuff all puzzles into a single row :poop:
 Westicles: it seems I will never catch the french, they'll always be one ahead due to the teads puzzle
 Westicles: afaik the only unreachable deleted puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: make your own puzzle, solve it and then get it deleted before they see it
 Westicles: yeah, I thought about that.  and put unicode in the title so no forum post
 eulerscheZahl: use unicode in the title so they don't find it via forum message (the bot has a bzug)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: same idea
 Westicles: ha.  yeah, but I am too scared to pull more stunts 
 struct: damn, was checking discord and its even worse than I thought
 eulerscheZahl: so much hate for the escape
 eulerscheZahl: we have a strong bot community
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 jrke: the most reacted normal message i ever noticed on CG discord server
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1tyd2gw">https://prnt.sc/1tyd2gw</a>
 darkhorse64: It's clearly not my interest but I'll probably gather some friends IRL and try the escape
 struct: its not about being an escape
 struct: its about whats next
 darkhorse64: Wow, it gets even worse than I thought. Time to dig boardgamegeek.com
 struct: they say they dont know what the future will be
 darkhorse64: Yes, I read that too
 eulerscheZahl: so, do we have to hope for a fail at the escape?
 Astrobytes: Would appear so. I don't like wishing failure on anyone but..
 eulerscheZahl: same. i like cg too much to wish them bad luck
 struct: I wont be in chat during the contest tbh
 jrke: not failure but something for bot programming
 struct: Its the only thing i will do
 jacek: fail at escape would win success on bot programming?
 Uljahn: maybe they will conduct another survey
 jrke: i think the feedback form of this contest could be decisive factor for fututr
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jrke: future*
 darkhorse64: Does that mean that  high level coding is not so popular&#160;? There is hardly any bot competition elsewhere
 struct: its probably more related to the cost of them
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/blog/ai-game-competitions-list">https://www.gocoder.one/blog/ai-game-competitions-list</a>
 -oa-: at 0% in shortest, all should be tied, regardles of code length imho
 struct: Also I dont see how they can prevent cheating on esacpe
 jacek: for 0% just submit empty code
 eulerscheZahl: that's why time matters. at least #1 is without
 Astrobytes: cheating? How would one do that on an escape?
 eulerscheZahl: sarcasm?
 struct: But doesnt the timer starts when you start playing?
 eulerscheZahl: no, read the help page
 eulerscheZahl: ceg
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: ah I see
 eulerscheZahl: To prevent cheating, the default leaderboard will rank teams according to the official start time of the event.
 eulerscheZahl: Are there any prize to win?
 struct: time to make a team of 6 of me to get shirts
 eulerscheZahl: you mean 5 teams of 6 of you
 struct: maybe
 struct: math is hard
 eulerscheZahl: team 1: struct, Tobou, nulte, who else?
 eulerscheZahl: + deleted user
 cosmix: teams for what?
 eulerscheZahl: escape contest
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile we are at 15 :sob: reactions
 Astrobytes: I can't help but think that they're making a terrible mistake; then again I never was the optimistic sort
 eulerscheZahl: they tried a similar thing with tech.ioit's just a completely different audience and you can't shift CG players to the other platform. building a new community takes years
 eulerscheZahl: now they try the same but this time the competitive platform gets a real hit while tech.io was running mostly in parallel
 Astrobytes: Yes. And tech.io was never a risk to the community here
 eulerscheZahl: even tech.io got some hate from hardcore CG players of that time
 Astrobytes: tech.io just smells of wasted potential to me
 eulerscheZahl: it's a cool idea. i was impressed by how much you can do on that platform when I created a playground
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it is cool. Just way underutilised.
 darkhorse64: I even use it to benchmark my bitboard code
 Astrobytes: nice&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: Never really understood the point of tech.io, what's it supposed to be for?
 darkhorse64: godbolt is also worthy for that purpose and you can even look at the asm
 eulerscheZahl: sharing knowledge
 Astrobytes: yeah godbolt is superb
 eulerscheZahl: write an article about any IT topic that you are skilled in
 darkhorse64: knowledg is powa
 struct: I just use it for the same thing that darkhorse does
 struct: But the cpus on tech io are a bit slower than cg ones
 NeoTytanX: who asked
 struct: Kalamari did
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/213/using-c-linq---a-practical-overview/welcome">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/213/using-c-linq---a-practical-overview/welcome</a>articles like this one are the initial idea behind tech.io

 JacobTheCoder: hello
 carl-h: hey
 carl-h: can someone join the discord vc and help me
 carl-h: im doing C# but if you use another language then it should still work
 carl-h: ill be here for a while chilling in general VC
 Uljahn: hey, could you be more specific with the kind of help you need?
 carl-h: im not understanding the tutorial and im still learning how to do C# 
 carl-h: im extremely new
 Uljahn: the tutorial?
 carl-h: yeah it's guiding me but idk what it wants me to do
 carl-h: if you join the vc i can screen share
 eulerscheZahl: i join if astro does too
 Uljahn: it might be tough to learn a language and solve problems at the same time, i'd recommend to do the former first
 eulerscheZahl: ah, CSB stream
 eulerscheZahl: wontonimo your chance to shine
 ZarthaxX: toad lost interest real fast :P
 eulerscheZahl: no, i was giving astro a chance for a paradoxon by saying "i join if euler doesn't"
 eulerscheZahl: but he missed it
 ZarthaxX: i didnt read that
 CodingWizardAI: Has anyone done the Davinci coding escape, I'm almost done, but I can't find the encrypted message anywhere
 ZarthaxX: was that a pm
 ZarthaxX: fun one :P
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl  05:06PMi join if astro does too
 ZarthaxX: but that isnt a paradoxon
 eulerscheZahl: it is, if astro gives the right reply
 ZarthaxX: ahhh
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: pity he is afk
 eulerscheZahl: euler =&gt; astro =&gt; !euler =&gt; !astro =&gt; euler =&gt; ...
 ZarthaxX: my brain cant stand this already :P
 eulerscheZahl: there was this Simpsons episode where Lisa was sick and Marge says that she shall stay home
 eulerscheZahl: Bart: "when Lisa stays home, I'll stay at home too"Lisa: "when Bart stays at home, I'll go to school"
 eulerscheZahl: bart: confused
 ZarthaxX: that's me :rofl: haha
 ZarthaxX: 3 guys talking about csb already in vc
 eulerscheZahl: you are not a polar bear of culture
 ZarthaxX: i havent watched simpsons in years
 eulerscheZahl: shall we join the party?
 ZarthaxX: forgot already
 eulerscheZahl: oh, 2 again
 ZarthaxX: im techincally working
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: i also stopped watching simpsons years ago. they just put stupid gags over a real story nowadays
 ZarthaxX: procoder didnt understand csb :P
 ZarthaxX: it has become quite bad since they changed owner right
 ZarthaxX: i mean the rights
 ProCoder03: dude, my mic isn't working 
 struct: are you streaming csb?
 eulerscheZahl: fine, i'll do it
 ZarthaxX: struct not toad 
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 struct: ah they want to chat about C#
 ZarthaxX: who is that guy Bata man the duck knight#0468
 struct: not my expertise 
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 ZarthaxX: struct i think the guy just doesnt get the commands part of csb
 ZarthaxX: printing out actions and such
 eulerscheZahl: they don't need me, going to (Y, Y) instead of (X, Y)
 ZarthaxX: :rofl.
 Astrobytes: I missed it, sorry, was afk :D
 eulerscheZahl: do you at least agree that it would have been a good reply?
 eulerscheZahl: did that once in real life"i go there if euler comes too""i go there if you don't"someone didn't get the joke&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, well, I liked it at least&#160;:)
 ipsissimus: had a job interview at 10.  guy sends me hackerrank link
 ipsissimus: doesnt ask any code related questions
 ipsissimus:&#160;:|
 eulerscheZahl: so, in what position do you see yourself in 5 years?
 eulerscheZahl: what was your best team experience?
 ipsissimus: hopefully asking non code related questions
 eulerscheZahl: you have 9 marbles that all look the same. but you know that one has less weight than the rest.
 eulerscheZahl: how often do you have to use a pair of scales to find it?
 struct: are these real questions?
 fkberthold: I've gotten a variant on the marble one for a Sr. dev position in the last couple of years.
 eulerscheZahl: i got asked some nonsense like "when you have been the most proud/disappointed about yourself?"
 eulerscheZahl: refused to answer, got the job anyways :rofl:
 Westicles: if you throw a penny off a boat, does the water level rise or fall
 eulerscheZahl: how big is the sea?
 WolfDarrigan: I'm doubting myself, but I think it falls
 eulerscheZahl: i go with raising
 Westicles: hmm, maybe I should have specified pond.  
 WolfDarrigan: oh well that changes everything&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Falls
 eulerscheZahl: or does it stay the same? no idea
 eulerscheZahl: Gravity Falls.Great show, I recommend watching it
 Astrobytes: something to do with displacement of mass/volume
 eulerscheZahl: 1st season is a bit meh but then it gets better
 fkberthold: Ok, if you change it from a penny and a boat to a bowling ball and a really big bucket. It would rise because the bucket(which displaces more water because it takes up a larger area) would then just be floating at the top and the bowling ball would sink. Does the same apply for the penny and the boat?
 WolfDarrigan: You can make it more extreme without changing too much, imagine your penny weighed as much as a car, but was still the same volume. How does that change your answer?
 eulerscheZahl: but inside the boat the weight will push the boat down as well
 eulerscheZahl: surely also related to the difference in mass density of water and penny
 WolfDarrigan: the answer is very different if you use very small rocks
 eulerscheZahl: KalamariKing you misspelled "but i'm lonely"
 KalamariKing: i forgot the pound symbol exists
 eulerscheZahl: you wrote the O too late
 eulerscheZahl: a few years ago codeforces liked to ping @everyone on discord for some announcements that don't affect many users
 eulerscheZahl: there was always a WHO CARES reaction
 eulerscheZahl: they've stopped pinging
 KalamariKing: I did write the o too late damn
 Astrobytes: You've done it wrong again
 KalamariKing: fr
 MeBen: Very frustrating when you don't get 100% because of a hidden "Crash test" validator.
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yes
 Stepan0806: are there chat in coding escape?
 TimothyAlexisVass: What do you mean?
 Stepan0806: chat like this
 Stepan0806: not only audio
 eulerscheZahl: you could use some external chat like discord with your team if needed
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know if CG itself has a chat for you
 Astrobytes: can't remember :thinking:
 MeBen: What's the motivation behind making coding escapes a team-only thing?
 Astrobytes: You can always make your own #channel anyway
 eulerscheZahl: but does the escape have a chat on the side?
 Astrobytes: MeBen: It's a teambuilding event product fundamentally
 Astrobytes: euler: that's what I can't remember :D
 Astrobytes: First 2 times, we used Zoom or Teams or something. Then they introduced the voice plugin
 MeBen: Oh right, that makes sense. I hate teambuilding exercises ... maybe that's why my team work is so bad.
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, you can just skip the contest
 Astrobytes: It won't affect your stats or anything
 MeBen: The escapes sound like a really fun idea though
 eulerscheZahl: i took off Monday and Tuesday in 2 weeks for the Huawei optim on codeforces. I hope it's worth it
 Astrobytes: They are fun, don't get me wrong (with a decent team of people)
 eulerscheZahl: we are just salty as this one replaced our beloved bot programming contest
 Astrobytes: Oh the graph/flow one. I might even join just to pass the time.
 eulerscheZahl: i'd be perfectly fine if they would co-exist
 Astrobytes: ^
 XeroOl: why does this chat keep refreshing and moving my focus to it
 eulerscheZahl: someone launched a "competitive programming hall of game" website.they estimate that tourist won about $350000 of prize money :o
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:tourist">https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:tourist</a>
 eulerscheZahl: XeroOl add ?disableChat to the URL to hide it completely
 XeroOl: interesting
 XeroOl: thanks
 Astrobytes: lol, pretty impressive
 BlaiseEbuth: :metal::imp:
 eulerscheZahl: even Errichto "only" at $4000
 Astrobytes: Gennady is a beast though
 eulerscheZahl: no doubt
 eulerscheZahl: and I can definitely name 2 contests where tourist also won some real money, that aren't even mentioned there
 eulerscheZahl: so definitely more than those 2, if even I can name 2
 Astrobytes: And this only covers cash prizes, he's won lots of hardware etc too
 eulerscheZahl: they don't even list hackerrank. there used to be some highly paid top ranks as well
 eulerscheZahl: like $2.5k or so. was meant to last 2 days and he finished it in 2h
 Astrobytes: lol, sounds like him
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/world-codesprint-12/leaderboard">https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/world-codesprint-12/leaderboard</a>
 eulerscheZahl: $1000 for the winner, I just checked
 Astrobytes: Nice. I only know 2 names on that list lol
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/world-codesprint-10/leaderboard">https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/world-codesprint-10/leaderboard</a>and another 2000
 eulerscheZahl: which are the 2 names you know?
 Astrobytes: Gennady and izban
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/university-codesprint-2/leaderboard">https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/university-codesprint-2/leaderboard</a>and $2000 again

 eulerscheZahl: looks like he could make a living from those contests alone
 Astrobytes: Maybe he does. Does he work somewhere that you know of?
 eulerscheZahl: isn't he still a student? i don't know
 Astrobytes: Hm, he might be still
 eulerscheZahl: they also miss google hashcode on that list
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. Gonna change my job and only do programming contest.
 Astrobytes: I reckon he's far above $500k in earnings
 eulerscheZahl: yes, sounds right
 eulerscheZahl: also some topcoder single rounds that are not listed there
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: right? Nice work if you can get it!
 BlaiseEbuth: More fun. More liberty. More money
 eulerscheZahl: yet he even took the time to play some clashes on CG
 BlaiseEbuth: No income tax
 Amloxg: hi
 eulerscheZahl: found my tutor back from university days<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:Vertigo1111">https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:Vertigo1111</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Still alive? :o
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah no. Stop in 2013
 Astrobytes: jeez, euler's not that old lol
 eulerscheZahl: he was still there when I graduated in 2018. working on his PhD
 eulerscheZahl: apparently he still is on the university, publishing papers and such
 Astrobytes: On which topics?
 Astrobytes: (if you know)
 BlaiseEbuth: Toads
 eulerscheZahl: lots of particle swarm optimization
 Astrobytes: Interesting. I didn't know that PSO was so popular in research
 BlaiseEbuth: :bee:
 Astrobytes: :particle:
 Astrobytes: meh
 BlaiseEbuth: :sheep:
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: No more videos Blaise? :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Took so much time to do... -_-
 miszu: for c++ users, do you use visual studio for coding or the game ide?
 Astrobytes: VS
 miszu: which version?
 BlaiseEbuth: vs code
 Astrobytes: Visual Studio 2019
 Kudema: i couldn't do it in js
 Kudema: it's throwing 'Nothing' mpm
 miszu: any plugins worth installing for visual studio?
 miszu: to be more efficient?
 Astrobytes: Maybe? Haven't checked recently tbh
 Kudema: prettier 
 miszu: you didn't use anything?
 Astrobytes: No, it does most of what I need
 miszu: oh ok thanks
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: VS Code for me as well
 eulerscheZahl: and g++
 BlaiseEbuth: +1
 Astrobytes: I use vscode for everything non C++
 Astrobytes: On linux tho, vscode + g++
 69razer69: do anyone have an idea of effeciant way to solve "the river l" puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: is that there you have to find where both numbers meet?
 Astrobytes: yeah I think so
 eulerscheZahl: you have 2 numbers a and blet's say a &lt; b
 valnix: can somebody discord call with me and help me in python 3. im new so i want to learn some stuff
 eulerscheZahl: so you need a larger a to find the point where they meet. so you compute the next higher value for a
 eulerscheZahl: and you have a new (a,b)
 eulerscheZahl: swap to make a the smaller again
 eulerscheZahl: repeat until equal
 Astrobytes: wonder if people will stream the 'contest'...
 BlaiseEbuth: Sharing solutions&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Tongue in cheek comment
 eulerscheZahl: but we want to encourage streaming, don't we?
 BlaiseEbuth: :smirk:
 valnix: can somebody discord call with me and help me in python 3. im new so i want to learn some stuff
 Astrobytes: No.
 valnix: oh okay
 valnix: sry
 BlaiseEbuth: Call python.org he is nice
 Astrobytes: Try discord
 Schwase: is it your first language?
 valnix: yeah
 valnix: it is my first time getting into programming
 BlaiseEbuth: Poor boy...&#160;:(
 Schwase: then your previous message is misleading no offense lol
 69razer69: gl
 eulerscheZahl: at first everything will be new and confusing. totally normal
 Schwase: go to W3school
 Schwase: do everything
 69razer69: i recommend "learn python the hard way" for begginers
 valnix: yea:( pretty hard ngl
 Astrobytes: was that updated for python3?
 69razer69: its a book
 Astrobytes: online too
 69razer69: no but as a bigginer it doesnt matter which python u are using
 Astrobytes: I would argue otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: some more resources: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html#Python">http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html#Python</a>
 69razer69: khkhkh
 69razer69: lol
 Astrobytes: Hah!
 69razer69: link&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: just make sure that you learn python3 and not python2 (outdated)
 Astrobytes: That's what I said before.
 eulerscheZahl: oh sorry
 eulerscheZahl: was distracted finding the link
 valnix: i watched one guys video, like 4 hour youtube of python tutorials. i learned some stuff like print stuff out of how to build basic calculators, but not really ready for most of the stuff
 eulerscheZahl: you will never feel ready by just watching
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll argue that as a beginner python2 or 3 doesn't matter, as far as you use none.
 eulerscheZahl: at one point you have to start writing
 Astrobytes: Concentrate on variables, scope, logical operations and conditional flow, loops etc
 69razer69: why i really dont see a major diffrance a begginer will notice between py3 and py2
 eulerscheZahl: one is deprecated. and there are minor differences even in basic things like division
 eulerscheZahl: what is 5/3 in py2 vs py3?
 BlaiseEbuth: A mistake in both?
 Astrobytes: oh wait this is an integer division thing
 eulerscheZahl: yes. py3 returns a float while py2 says it's 1
 eulerscheZahl: in py3 you can still do 5//3
 Astrobytes: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: for int division
 eulerscheZahl: of course there are more differences. that's just one you'll come across very early
 Astrobytes: printing
 eulerscheZahl: print 'something'print('something')
 eulerscheZahl: golfers hate this change
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Still amazes me how python has become what it is today
 LagunaElectric: golfers?
 valnix: thats literally only thing i can do in python other from like input("something something")
 Astrobytes: Back in the day, it was something that strange guy in the corner used when everyone else used perl
 eulerscheZahl: code golf: you solve simple programming tasks. but with as few characters as possible
 LagunaElectric: Ohhhh
 LagunaElectric: That sounds pretty neat
 LagunaElectric: When you need to write a python script but only have 32kb storage lol
 miszu: imagine doing competition with 32kb
 eulerscheZahl: we have 100kb
 eulerscheZahl: + 768MB RAM
 miszu: doing we have like 1GB of mem we can use?
 miszu: ok yeah
 miszu: 100kb + 768MB = 768 MB
 miszu: what's the 100kb for?
 darkhorse64: for the code
 miszu: so your code file is max 100kb?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 miszu: ohhhh
 miszu: so there is a limit how much lookup table you put
 ZarthaxX: miszu you mean lookup table like hardcoded?
 eulerscheZahl: opening book
 ZarthaxX: yeah i meant that
 eulerscheZahl: ZarthaxX friendly reminder: you still have to react with :sob: on the #annoucements channel on discord
 ZarthaxX: ohhh right
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh? I'll do that to
 ZarthaxX: i was surprised by the amount of negative emojis
 eulerscheZahl: we can make our own statistics that work in our favor
 ZarthaxX: done
 Astrobytes: Why surprised? I wasn't.
 ZarthaxX: we are about to surpass the thumbs up
 miszu: ZarthaxX yeah exactly
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i mean i dont like it either, but maybe it was just my personal taste lol
 ZarthaxX: miszu ah ok
 miszu: is this chat more active than disc?
 ZarthaxX: so then yeah, you are limited by 100kb to hardcode
 miszu: I rarely use disc
 eulerscheZahl: this chat is more active, yes
 Astrobytes: also hi ZarthaxX&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Only for dinosaurs
 ZarthaxX: haii
 Astrobytes: usually
 ZarthaxX: howdyy
 Astrobytes: I wonder what all the staff feel about the change of contest format
 ZarthaxX: anxious maybe
 Astrobytes: That for sure, being a new thing yeah
 ZarthaxX: emojis are not a good sign :D
 eulerscheZahl: same. i have a feeling that thibaud has to sell soemthing to use that he himself doesn't fully stand behind
 ZarthaxX: they are probably betting for new people coming in from this
 Astrobytes: Participation will show I guess
 BlaiseEbuth: They're all happy! And will stay happy until they change of job
 eulerscheZahl: at least replacing the contest with it
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: yes I get that feeling
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth too perfect to be real :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Already fired
 Astrobytes: Maybe he works a lot on Escapes now, who knows
 ZarthaxX: he is working in the escape SDK as we speak :D
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 eulerscheZahl: we are programmers, even simple UI is challenging for us
 eulerscheZahl: those escape rooms are much more about visuals
 Astrobytes: True
 ZarthaxX: i agree 10%
 Astrobytes: Still, I imagine a lot of it is JS gluing it all together
 ZarthaxX: 100000*
 ZarthaxX: visuals are hard&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: euler is a fantastic artist
 BlaiseEbuth: Your feelings about the cm was just because he have to sell (do) something...
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 ZarthaxX: like bob ross Astrobytes
 ZarthaxX: toad ross
 eulerscheZahl: i feel trolled
 Astrobytes: Toad Ross! :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Little Happy Trees
 Astrobytes: :tree:
 Astrobytes: ffs
 ZarthaxX: LOL

 eulerscheZahl: background for tryangle catch, true masterpiece
 eulerscheZahl: I also generated that with code
 Astrobytes: that's pretty decent, not quite as good as your initial Tower Dereference art though :heart_eyes_cat:
 ZarthaxX: i see that quite blurry huh
 eulerscheZahl: i liked the attackers at my initial TD
 eulerscheZahl: the angry face
 Astrobytes: Yeah!
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: actually I wanted to draw a tower. then i made a bad mouse movement and suddenly it looked like a face :D
 eulerscheZahl: not even joking
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: first thought: hey cool, I have an attacker now.2nd thought: damn, I still need a tower
 Astrobytes: You never know at which moment artistic genius will strike
 struct: if you want to hardcode the opening you should pick amazons
 struct: Book should be easy
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: not c4?
 struct: never tried c4
 jacek: opening book works well in onitama, hence the result i got
 Astrobytes: c4 is too explosive for an opening book...
 struct: meanwhile you probably cant book even depth 2 on amazons
 Astrobytes: one day smits will find a way, he plays the long game
 jacek: smits: "hold my beer"
 Astrobytes: right&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: euler: bedtime
 Astrobytes: lol he went already :older_man:
 LagunaElectric: What book are we talking about? ðŸ¤”
 struct: opening books

 LagunaElectric: Ahhhhh
 LagunaElectric: I'm learning so much about the world just watching chat lol
 EricMoret: lmao

 miszu: and also end game solver up to 7 pieces or so
 jacek: 8 pieces endtables seem to be within reach for todays supercomputers and petabytes ssd

 LagunaElectric: Need to rob bezos to afford that much storage and processing power, though&#160;;-;
 XeroOl: (
 XeroOl: oops it keeps focusing the chat window
 XeroOl: my bad
 Astrobytes: don't forget your ?disableChat
 XeroOl: yeah
 XeroOl: I feel like the chat would be fine if it didn't grab focus every time it disconnects and refreshes
 XeroOl: it literally pulls the cursor from the code into the chat

 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a touch annoying.Does it still do it if you just minimise the chat with the arrow?
 BlaiseEbuth: No chat no problem
 XeroOl: I don't think so, no
 struct: your chat keep disconecting?
 Astrobytes: well, the above 3 solutions should work
 EricMoret: are ZacLiew or TimberStalker here&#160;?
 XeroOl: yeah, every once in a while it disconnects and reconnects
 struct: hm
 struct: That also happens in my other account
 struct: but never on this one
 struct: Its so strange
 Astrobytes: That is peculiar
 LagunaElectric: I wanna have a go at the brainfuck interpreter challenge but I haven't built an interpreter before and it's a bit intimidating
 BlaiseEbuth: \o/
 XeroOl: does python have tree sets?
 Astrobytes: Just go for it LagunaElectric
 XeroOl: I know what data structure I want, but I don't know what it's called in python
 LagunaElectric: Xero if in doubt, implement it :D
 XeroOl: yeah but this is python
 BlaiseEbuth: Implement it in c
 LagunaElectric: ^ then import lol
 BlaiseEbuth: :p
 Astrobytes: You can do basic trees with dictionaries and lists (or sets maybe?)
 XeroOl: it doesn't really need to be a tree
 Astrobytes: Or just encapsulate it in a class
 LagunaElectric: yea, maybe a list of dicts?
 LagunaElectric: or a dict of dicts!
 XeroOl: I really just want O(n*log(n)) insertion + O(n*log(n)) "if this were inserted, what would it's index be"
 LagunaElectric: I should really learn about big O
 AllYourTrees: whats a tree set
 miszu: Big Oh is easy concept
 LagunaElectric: ^
 AllYourTrees: does it have a name in another language you know?
 XeroOl: Java has it as TreeSet
 AllYourTrees: oh so just a set?
 XeroOl: not quite
 XeroOl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html#lower(E)">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html#lower(E)</a>
 XeroOl: specifically this method isn't something that a regular set has
 AllYourTrees: ahh yeah i don't think python has anything like that built in
 LagunaElectric: Implement it, bb&#160;:)
 LagunaElectric: Then you can have it do whatever you like!
 XeroOl: there is no reason to implement it here
 AllYourTrees: maybe heapq? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html</a>
 AllYourTrees: that just gives you the datastructure though, you'd still need to walk it yourself for the lower method
 XeroOl: well heaps can find the smallest with log(n)
 XeroOl: but not like an arbitrary size binary search
 XeroOl: maybe I can get away with just a heap here
 XeroOl: I dunno
 LagunaElectric: I believe in you :D
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't. Let's hope Laguna support will be enough...
 Astrobytes: Experiment, you'll learn along the way anyway
 LagunaElectric: My support doesn't always work, but it does help&#160;:)
 XeroOl: it's just that re-implementing a red-black tree isn't worth my time
 XeroOl: I might as well just solve this in Java lol
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 XeroOl: heapq is definitely new to me
 LagunaElectric:&#160;;-;
 XeroOl: I will try to remember that
 AllYourTrees: :tada:
 AllYourTrees: jacek how many sims per turn do you use during training for NN+MCTS?
 XeroOl: I feel like I should just read through every single valid python import one by one
 Astrobytes: implementing anything in anything is usually worth your time if you want to get to know the language
 Astrobytes: (within reason ofc)
 AllYourTrees: Xero maybe bisect library useful for you? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html</a>
 AllYourTrees: they have example code for "    'Find rightmost value less than or equal to x':
 XeroOl: oooooo
 XeroOl: it's not quite O(logn) for insertion, but that looks super useful
 carl-h: hey
 carl-h: where can i contact owner of the website?
 JBM: find the contact tab
 carl-h: the community manager is horrid and bias towards moderators.
 carl-h: punishes them for doing things he doesn't like even if it isn't against the rules
 JBM: power corrupts, news at 11
 carl-h: wym?
 miszu: like what?
 carl-h: are you asking me?
 miszu: yes
 carl-h: join general vc on their discord ill screen share and show you
 carl-h: just to verify as proof
 carl-h: if you cannot that is okay i will just explain but it'll take a bit
 miszu: I don't see general_vc
 carl-h: im in it currently
 carl-h: in the discord
 miszu: I am on my phone so can't access voice
 carl-h: its labeled general under VOICE CHANNELS
 carl-h: my phone is able to it could be a bug

 ipsissimus: guys help
 ipsissimus: im addicted to code clash
 b1gfreakn: as long as it's not reverse mode
 darkhorse64: delete your account 
 ipsissimus: i  literally hate reverse questions
 ipsissimus: takes me 12 mins to figure it out
 ipsissimus: cuz i have a smooth aerodynamic brain
 ipsissimus: no gross wrinkles
 b1gfreakn: they're awful and so damn vague. they leave me feeling stupid and i don't feel like they help me hone coding skills
 ipsissimus: no wrinkle = no think
 ipsissimus: no think = no sad
 b1gfreakn: the number-based ones anyway.
 ipsissimus: always that pesky 4th test case
 ipsissimus: whats this??
 ipsissimus: first place for the first time ever?
 ipsissimus: nani?
 b1gfreakn: nice
 b1gfreakn: feels good.

 Manjius: if i do this in python: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fd15caec-fc10-401c-83e2-f33d5803ac27">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fd15caec-fc10-401c-83e2-f33d5803ac27</a>
 Manjius: oh wtf
 Schwase: i thought i kind of understood python until i just found out that you can assign basic operations like "int" to a single character. Mind blown
 Manjius: im gonna test it lets see
 Manjius: it does, wtf
 Manjius: its a reference not a copy
 ZarthaxX: int is just a function
 ZarthaxX: you can assign functions to variables and use the variables as functions
 ZarthaxX: they just point to the function you assigned them
 ZarthaxX: no black magic there 
 Wontonimo: anyone here?
 miszu: hey
 mr.bossman: no
 ZarthaxX: ye
 DarknessR: Hmm
 Wontonimo: hey miszu, it's been a while
 Wontonimo: how are you?
 Wontonimo: hey ZarthaxX :wave:
 Wontonimo: (/*-*)/ Zarthax \(*-*\)
 Astrobytes: I'm here, but I'm really goneI'm tired and going to bed, babyyy
 Wontonimo: bye bye Astro!
 Thorcode: Wontonimo how could you go to bed so late?
 Wontonimo: i'm not going to bed
 Wontonimo: it's only 8:45pm here
 Wontonimo: anyone working on a bot battle or puzzle that they'd like to talk about?
 miszu: I am doing the fall challenge 2020
 miszu: rewriting it
 miszu: trying to do sims
 Wontonimo: oh cool
 miszu: reading all the small rules so that my state is correct
 Wontonimo: I"ve only achieve wood 1 in FC2020
 Wontonimo: haven't written a sim yet
 miszu: yeah lots of edge cases to figure out
 Wontonimo: oh nice, you are in silver and in the top 25% overall
 miszu: but I was doing stupid thing
 miszu: nothing very smart
 Wontonimo: what search are you using?
 Wontonimo: seems like beam, bfs, dfs, minimax, and mcts would all be reasonable
 miszu: I will try to use the beam search
 miszu: which is a special case of bfs
 miszu: dfs makes no sense
 Wontonimo: wdym dfs makes no sense?
 miszu: because you use heuristics to chose your next node to explore
 Wontonimo: you could still use dfs, and some heuristics could be to prune (to get deeper) and some heuristics could be for scoring
 miszu: but that's not dfs anymore&#160;:) it becomes beam search
 Wontonimo: if there is no queue then it is dfs.  you need a queue for beam
 miszu: and it feels like the deeper you go, the less weight it will have
 miszu: because there are lots of unknown
 struct: beam is considered bfs?
 struct: dfs*
 Wontonimo: dfs uses FIFO, bfs uses FILO, beam uses sorted queue
 miszu: if we talk vanilla
 Wontonimo: sorry dfs is FILO
 miszu: I am not vanilla
 Wontonimo: bfs is FIFO
 miszu: yes correct
 Wontonimo: how long did it take you to write the sim&#160;?  i'm wondering if I want to jump in
 miszu: i haven't start it yet
 miszu: I am still writing the actions for my model
 Wontonimo: oh, you got to silver without a sim!
 miszu: yeah
 Wontonimo: hats off
 miszu: so I did ctrl A + del and doing it the correct way
 miszu: getting out of silver you need a good sims
 miszu: thanks
 miszu: usually you can get silver without sims
 struct: which game?
 miszu: the witch game
 struct: I had to sim that one
 struct: first I had MC which reached silver I think
 struct: then I switched to beam search
 Wontonimo: seems like a beam problem
 Wontonimo: there are so many rules for this sim
 miszu: yeah I know
 miszu: lots of corner cases
 Wontonimo: how long did it take you to write the sim struct?
 struct: like 1 day
 struct: But I ignored enemy
 Wontonimo: seems reasonable
 Wontonimo: got you to legend
 struct: only after the contest ended
 struct: Also my beam search wasnt correct
 struct: Every depth I would count all the moves that originated that state 
 struct: an
 struct: and then at the end I chose the most present one
 miszu: coding the sims sounds the fun part
 miszu: writing the engine and all the rules is the not-so-fun part
 Wontonimo: the rules and edge cases is what we normally call the "simulation"
 liboy129: wsp
 Wontonimo: talking about code
 Wontonimo: have you tried this contribution&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/894199f1812b7f93203e7db5a30b5ff51dbafb">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/894199f1812b7f93203e7db5a30b5ff51dbafb</a>
 magus2: looks interesting
 Wontonimo: since all the legal moves are provided, it is pretty easy to make a random bot
 Wontonimo: or a heuristic value for each move and just pick the valid move that has the best heuristic score
 liboy129: damn that was fun
 miszu: I smell MCTS on steroid

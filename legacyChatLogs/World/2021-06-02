 MSmits: morning
 Marchete: o/
 alen23: laptop or pc
 MSmits: dunno what o/ is, but hi there Marchete&#160;:)
 Marchete: a guy waving
 MSmits: :wave:
 MSmits: mmh I had all easy puzzles solved 1,5 yrs ago
 MSmits: now I have 55% =/
 Marchete: I haven't looked puzzles since they mixed official with community ones
 MSmits: oh then you're below 20% :P
 MSmits: some puzzles are crap, but as long as there's the occasional gem, it's a nice timewaster on the train&#160;:)
 Marchete: see this madness
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06212.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06212.pdf</a>
 Marchete: GA for hyperparameters  for NN train
 MSmits: yeah, i just got to that conclusion&#160;:)
 MSmits: reading 1,5 page
 MSmits: why is this madness?
 MSmits: I knew they used GA for this
 MSmits: should be right up your alley if you get to it
 MSmits: but you should get something working with a poor choice of hyperparameters first
 MSmits: can always optimize later
 Marchete: train a trainer to train a bot
 MSmits: oh yeah, the idea is weird
 Marchete: you are too geek to see it as a complete insanity
 MSmits: similar to meta meta mcts :P
 Marchete: yeah
 kovi: yeah, i was wondering why ga...why not an nn
 Marchete: I was just thinking about meta MCTS
 Marchete: your*
 Marchete: lol kovi
 MSmits: oh I think about it all the time, but why would you Marchete?
 Marchete: a NN to get a better NN
 MSmits: it's a little different though, meta mcts is just a tree with a subtree, that's not the same as hyperparameters. It's an extra layer, but different concept
 Marchete: also these meta GA/MCTS needs some tuning...
 kovi: back to reality - my impression is that we are not there yet. it is partly science, partly art
 Marchete: hey that's a room for another meta!
 MSmits: in nature, brains are evolved to fit the task. Small animals have smaller brains
 Marchete: I wouldn't call NN "art"
 MSmits: so GA is not a bad idea here
 kovi: hyperparameter optimization
 MSmits: evolution of the species is just hyperparamter optimization
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/1838/">https://xkcd.com/1838/</a>
 kovi: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: that's my point of view
 MSmits: I am using this one
 MSmits: for my talk
 MSmits: doing a talk at my school about my research project for teaching AI to students 
 Marchete: it's funny because it's true
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: all these formal papers? stir the pile clockwise or ccw
 Marchete: with tons of algebra and formulas
 MSmits: it's funny that NN's are basically inspried by the brain and we understand them as well as we do the brain, which is to say quite poorly&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's probably fundamental to the thing
 MSmits: wasn't there research about sparsely connected NN's&#160;? 
 MSmits: And NN's growing new connections?
 MSmits: I think these were far more efficient, but probably even harder to get to work
 Marchete: cut a brain in very thin slices
 Marchete: replicate neurons and connections on a computer
 Marchete: success
 MSmits: lol
 Marchete: I'm not joking
 Marchete: I remember some scientists did with a worm
 Marchete: and worked
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: wow really
 Marchete: it was years ago
 Marchete: I can't recall where I read it
 Best-Coder12: I was using scratch.mit.edu before. My level isn't bad. but I don't fully understand here. Where can I learn coding in writing?
 Marchete: maybe not a worm, but a small bug
 MSmits: that puts a whole new spin on the fact that your computer can be infected with a worm
 MSmits: Best-Coder12 you need to go do a python course
 MSmits: probably
 MSmits: this site is for players that know the basics in one language
 MSmits: (or more)
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429972-300-first-digital-animal-will-be-perfect-copy-of-real-worm/">https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429972-300-first-digital-animal-will-be-perfect-copy-of-real-worm/</a>
 MSmits: open worm project lol...
 Best-Coder12: Do you know a site for beginners?
 MSmits: someone will know, my suggestion would be subpar I think
 MSmits: at my school we have our own teaching environment which is not open to the public
 jacek: also, using NN to design NN isn't new <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://peltarion.com/blog/data-science/nas-search">https://peltarion.com/blog/data-science/nas-search</a>

 Chromicquanta: Hello, World!
 MSmits: “And as they become more and more complex you start to have ethical questions, such as should you really turn off the computer.”
 MSmits: hi Chromicquanta
 MSmits: I know the answer to this
 MSmits: you don't. Keep running the meta mcts. Moooaar visits!

 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: well steal is confusing&#160;:)
 MSmits: very necessary in this game though
 jacek: we don't understand neural network fully either, and they are still far from 'real' neurons. they are just matrixes and matrix operations. in other words, humans don't understand math
 Best-Coder12:         Actually, I'm in 6th grade. teacher stopped teaching because he got angry with other students
 MSmits: sounds like a pro
 jacek: do you want to learn python or other language?
 MSmits: python is the common place to start these days, if you have no idea, start there, otherwise anything works
 MSmits: well... dont start in c++ or other old languages
 Best-Coder12: ı want learn phyton
 MSmits: my train is arriving. ttyl. Look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.learnpython.org/">https://www.learnpython.org/</a> Best-Coder12 or google for better places. There's no problem with doing multiple courses

 cmmcmc: which kind of tutorials
 KalamariKing: Lot of new folk here today, eh?
 KalamariKing: cmmcmc just google whatever you wanna learn. Neural networks? Google it, TensorFlow will probably show up. Basic programming? Google it, plenty will show up; w3schools, codecademy, or hell python.org if you wanna learn python
 Nerchio: or you can google youtube and watch stupid videos for a couple of hours, days or months
 Nerchio: whatever floats your boat

 struct: hi
 MSmits: hi struct
 struct: had so many bugs on mcts
 struct: took me a while to code it this time
 MSmits: what did?
 MSmits: uttt?
 struct: It will be used in uttt yes
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: But I just did it for ttt
 struct: its easier to debug
 struct: I can just reuse it anyways
 MSmits: definitely
 struct: Now I need to try and add solver
 MSmits: yeah, it's not super difficult
 struct: Before I was doing rollout
 struct: and always returning 1
 struct: if a player won
 MSmits: sure
 struct: not a good idea :D
 struct: I need to return 1 or -1
 MSmits: ah yes
 struct: based on the player
 MSmits: btw, it's easier to backpropagate from first to last move
 MSmits: which is actually forward propagate i guess
 struct: easier?
 MSmits: yeah, because the starting sign is then the same
 MSmits: every time
 MSmits: you need to flip signs when backpropagating and depending on who was last to move its a +1 or -1
 MSmits: if you start at the beginning the sign is always the same
 struct: ah I see
 MSmits: i keep my selected nodes in an array
 MSmits: and just start from the first
 struct: yeah I do that too
 Marchete: damn python, is slow af
 struct: I also had a bug where I used Node&amp; node = nodes[N]
 struct: instead of Node* node = &amp;nodes[N]
 MSmits: depends on what you do with it Marchete, but generally yes :P
 Marchete: pretty much everything
 struct: then if i did node = other node at the first example
 Marchete: like reading and processing files
 struct: it would chance the node values
 Marchete: I'm trying to average samples, but is so slow
 MSmits: both of those can change node values
 MSmits: depending on how you use the reference or pointer
 MSmits: why average Marchete?
 MSmits: also is this with numpy or without?
 Marchete: input -&gt; sum(policy)/N sum(value)/N
 Marchete: it just dies
 Marchete: like 5 min per file
 MSmits: this is without numpy?
 MSmits: also how many items
 Marchete: as I'm using a dict, yes
 MSmits: eh dict is always gonna be slow
 MSmits: even in other languages
 Marchete: probably I'll need to get some numpy magic
 MSmits: it's hash based
 Marchete: yeah, I'm sure that C++ also will take 5 min per 40MB file
 MSmits: c++ will also be very slow, probably not 5 min
 MSmits: dictionary lookups are horrible
 Marchete: unordered_map?
 MSmits: it's equivalent to unordered map. 
 MSmits: yues
 MSmits: I replaced my unordered map by an index function that used 12 array lookups and many operations and it was still faster
 Marchete: I don't know how to average in numpy
 MSmits: (in my endgame book generator)
 Marchete: like input , average_policy, average_value
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.average.html">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.average.html</a>
 Wontonimo: np.mean isn't it for averaging?
 Marchete: I have no idea
 MSmits: should not be hard, try the functions they provide with some unit tests
 MSmits: i am no numpy guru, but i wouldnt worry about something as basic as sum or average&#160;:)

 MSmits: I think when they made jacek moderator, they accidentally told him the job description was to always provide the correct meme to go with conversations
 derjack: when did they made jacek moderator
 MSmits: didnt they?
 Wontonimo: i like that joke
 MSmits: it's good
 Wontonimo: "it's easier to backpropagate from first to last move" - this would have saved me quite a lot of debugging but would also require me to create a new forward pass datastructure
 MSmits: why
 Wontonimo: i have to admit that i've made the error of passing the wrong data 
 Wontonimo: with the wrong sign, like you said
 MSmits: why use any data structure besides an array of node pointers?
 Wontonimo: that's it.  not more than that
 MSmits: ah ok, saves you from having parent references in the node and all that
 MSmits: pointers are huge
 Wontonimo: right.  that's a good idea
 MSmits: i can fit an entire oware or onitama game state in 1 pointer :P
 Wontonimo: +100
 MSmits: well with oware it also needs the score separately, but the point stands&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: and i can still reverse the list, as the "mcts-solver" is trivial when going in reverse
 Wontonimo: well, not "trivial" but certainly easier
 MSmits: why include the solver in the discussion? My solver doesnt use this list
 MSmits: should it? I never thought about that
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: it does use the list
 MSmits: in reverse even
 MSmits: i was confused for a sec
 Wontonimo: oh good, i thought i was missing something important about the solver
 MSmits: no, you use the same list, if it's a won node, parent is lost, if it's lost or draw, you check all siblings
 MSmits: if one of them is unfinished, you break out, otherwise you take the best result and negate for parent
 MSmits: it's reverse minimax
 MSmits: more or less
 Wontonimo: i have a backprop function for non-solver, and a backpropInfinity which does what it sounds like until it finds the case you are talking about then just calls backprop to finish the job
 MSmits: i dont like the infinity thing. Thats how they do it in the solver paper
 derjack: reverse minimax? like maximin?
 MSmits: but you need a separate thing for draws
 MSmits: and if you use a separate thing, you may as well just have a flag for everything
 Wontonimo: hmm, maybe I'm missing that.  I should take another look
 MSmits: i use -1, 0, 1, 2 for loss, draw, win, unfinished
 MSmits: jacek uses a flag for unfinished
 MSmits: and sets value to 0 for draws i think]
 Wontonimo: backpropInfinity is only called if tree expansion is at a terminal board configuration, otherwise just backprop
 MSmits: yeah thats how the paper does it
 MSmits: did you use that pseudo code?
 Wontonimo: unfinished?
 MSmits: unfinished game
 MSmits: not solved
 MSmits: or finished = solved
 MSmits: poor choice of words prolly
 derjack: my node has bool if its solved ~
 MSmits: yeah thats what i meant
 MSmits: and it has +inf and -inf and 0 for value right?
 Wontonimo: gotcha.  no, i didn't use the pseudo code of the paper.  read it, thought about it, left it for a day, drew it out from memory so that I understood it, coded it my own way
 MSmits: it's equivalent to what i do, just the normal uct with an extra flag needed for solving
 derjack: yes, but for jacekmax its +inf-rounds and -inf+rounds
 MSmits: to win sooner 
 Wontonimo: that's my usual MO
 MSmits: and lose later
 derjack: MO?
 Srijandev: oh
 MSmits: Wontonimo i tried to use the paper, it made my head hurt even though i sort of got it. Then coded it completely differently
 Wontonimo: method of operation&#160;: read paper, sleep on it, try to implement it from memory on another day to test understanding
 MSmits: wasnt it recursive also?
 MSmits: I just while looped it
 MSmits: i try not to use recursion when a  simple while loop suffices 
 Wontonimo: the only loop i have that is extra from just backprop is to look at the children
 MSmits: yeah same
 MSmits: i meant the pseudo code
 Wontonimo: no recursion!  that's crazytown
 MSmits: i think its recursive
 MSmits: anyways, train arriving, ttyl&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i made a point to not look at the pseudo code in that paper
 Wontonimo: ttyl
 MSmits: btw when i say train arriving, i mean i am in it and getting off of it
 Wontonimo: derjack , just realized I wasn't clear&#160;: MO = method of operation
 Uljahn: modus operandi
 Wontonimo: and i don't actually use infinity.  It's 1e10 or something like that.
 Wontonimo: oh, getting all latin and fancy.  yes, indeed you are correct Uljahn
 derjack: oh my
 Wontonimo: oh my?
 Uljahn: o.m.

 den_lakeev: guys, can i train model with Regression without transoforming object columns to float ones?
 Wontonimo: yes
 viwlife: Hi
 yassir58: hi
 MSmits: what a question den_lakeev
 AllYourTrees: for UTTT, is there a good way to choose a square when you have access to the whole board?
 AllYourTrees: good way as in simple rule based
 struct: make the move that forces the opponent to play on that board
 AllYourTrees: interesting, ty
 reCurse: Not sure anyone knows why, but if you leave vanilla MCTS forever on those positions it tends to favor that move
 AllYourTrees: reCurse how much time did you spend tuning hyperparameters on your NN + MCTS implementation?
 reCurse: shrug
 MSmits: wait AllYourTrees, did you mean access to all empty squares of the full 81 board?
 AllYourTrees: MSmits i just meant when you get a free play
 AllYourTrees: so i guess that includes first move?
 MSmits: yes they misunderstood you
 MSmits: a free move is just normal mcts, with a lot of options
 MSmits: often it's a good idea to win a miniboard with the free move
 MSmits: but not always
 AllYourTrees: yeah i'm trying to figure out how to make the number of actions max 9 instead of 81, but i can't think of how to get free play to only have 9 choices
 reCurse: At this point I'm just glad I'm reading chess stuff so my chance of relapse is minimal
 MSmits: AllYourTrees can you explain why it's important to you to have max 9 options?
 reCurse: MCTS node allocation optimization I would bet
 MSmits: is this because you are storing moves in a fixed size array on your node?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats my assumption
 reCurse: You can always select board first then move
 reCurse: Both fit in 9
 reCurse: Not that I recommend the approach
 reCurse: Just an idea
 MSmits: yeah, that works... i agree there are better ways
 AllYourTrees: yeah and also i've been trying to do some NN stuff and i think having a policy with only 9 outputs that get used always is better than 81 outputs that only 1/9th of them get used every turn
 MSmits: hmm
 reCurse: My intuition would tend to disagree with that
 reCurse: Useless comment sorry
 reCurse: I wouldn't know how to explain it
 AllYourTrees: haha no worries
 reCurse: And I get sick of my own rambling trying to
 AllYourTrees: maybe because the way the 9 smaller ones are layed out matters?
 AllYourTrees: like doing center square in center vs top left will probably be different?
 MSmits: yeah will be different
 reCurse: It will have to differentiate the context anyway
 reCurse: So neuralpower will be lost
 MSmits: but this question is really hard to answer without knowing your input structure and the rest of your network
 MSmits: i think
 AllYourTrees: fair
 MSmits: a similar question is whether to use one-hot for input, or multiple possible values per input
 darkhorse64: Actually, it's because one hot encoding leads to faster inference engine. It looks also more suitable for training 
 AllYourTrees: so far i have one hot with a couple of planes
 MSmits: planes?
 AllYourTrees: 1 plane = 9x9
 AllYourTrees: so input is 5x9x9
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: did you make a nn for CG before AllYourTrees?
 AllYourTrees: nope this is all local still
 reCurse: One-hot is better if there is discontinuity in your value
 MSmits: because from what i hear uttt is not the easiest place to start if you want to reach a high rank
 AllYourTrees: well i work with NNs at work
 AllYourTrees: yeah maybe i should switch to the connect 4... it seems like it is struggling on UTTT so far
 MSmits: reCurse like oware? It may not seem to have a discontinuity, but it has special values like having 0, 1 or 2 seeds, or being able to go round with 12+
 MSmits: robo and jacek both use one hot
 reCurse: I suspect there might be a discontinuity provoked by the number of affected squares
 MSmits: right
 kovi: discontinuity comes from constant cg forum interrupts
 doritosxxx: Hello. Is it possible to copy permalink to my clash of code leaderboard position?
 reCurse: Forums are alive?
 kovi: my mistake, chat
 MSmits: oh yeah, it interrupts a lot
 reCurse: Ah, yes true
 MSmits: hey, I'll be around 60-70% CS teacher next year, from only 4 hrs a week this year
 struct: Dont think so doritosxxx
 reCurse: Random thought MSmits
 reCurse: I often get annoyed at the same basic questions repeatedly asked in chat
 MSmits: yup
 reCurse: But as a teacher are you immune to that? Is that a requirement for the job?
 MSmits: hmm
 doritosxxx: that's a pity&#160;:(
 doritosxxx: thank you
 MSmits: if my mood is bad and I am annoyed with the particular students in that class, it might be annoying yes. If they're a good class and ask in good faith it's fine
 MSmits: patience  is a requirement anyways
 AllYourTrees: how long have you been a teacher for MSmits?
 MSmits: the misconception about teaching is that it's the same every year, but much is different. I prefer if it was more the same actually
 struct: just make those students play botg
 MSmits: AllYourTrees 15 years
 reCurse: Isn't the material mostly the same, and the beginners questions too? How is it different?
 AllYourTrees: wow nice! did you always know you wanted to be a teacher? how did you end up teaching?
 reCurse: I guess I do have that misconception, just wondering why
 MSmits: if I always teach 5th year physics of one particular level then yes
 MSmits: and even then the curriculum does change
 MSmits: but I get different age ranges
 MSmits: and thats physics
 MSmits: CS changes way more rapidly
 reCurse: Ok so you mix it up on purpose. I remember teachers mostly always giving the same kind of classes for years.
 reCurse: Well some of them anyway
 MSmits: well that's actually nice sometims, because it saves a lot of time
 MSmits: i can use the powerpoint from last year
 MSmits: oh and another thing. If you only explain something once or twice a year, it takes a loooong time before it gets repetitive
 MSmits: because a year is a long cycle
 reCurse: brb
 MSmits: there's also always new colleagues, new ideas for how to teach. Project-based education. The school is always changing
 MSmits: Older colleagues have trouble keeping up. They dont have trouble getting bored.
 ge_pet: hello!
 MSmits: hi ge_pet
 MSmits: for me personally. I enjoy teaching most when I get to explain very complicated stuff. I don't enjoy teaching the basics as much. 
 kovi: interesting msmits, thx for sharing
 MSmits: np, teaching is very different experience depending on the subject you teach also
 MSmits: CS and physics are different, but teaching French is even more different

 KalamariKing: No, no, it wasn't you
 KalamariKing: Someone in dms
 jacek: phew
 KalamariKing: Wow this page is slow
 KalamariKing: Makes exploring hard&#160;:/
 KalamariKing: How long has this page been nonsense
 jacek: since they switched to php :v
 KalamariKing: Do they know how the php is getting poisoned
 KalamariKing: conflicting intermediate edits?
 Jelafo: Hi everyone, can anyone tell me whether there are draws in UTTT (i.e. is this considered a draw: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/561557950">https://www.codingame.com/replay/561557950</a>)&#160;?
 Jelafo: The game statement does not seem to cover that case
 KalamariKing: first offuttt looks amazing
 KalamariKing: second off lemme read the rules
 struct: yes this is a draw
 struct: you have the same number of miniboards as the opponent
 cw477: woohoo im getting them interviews linedup
 cw477: feelsgoodman
 KalamariKing: Why would it be beneficial to play a different tile when a win is available
 struct: a miniboard win?
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 struct: or a complete win?
 KalamariKing: A miniboard win
 struct: because it can help opponent
 Jelafo: Okay thanks, i would have expected it to be a draw as well. If i look at the game in "last games" it shows as a win for the first plaer though... At least it looks like ti to me.
 struct: its a win if you have more miniboards won
 KalamariKing: Jelafo check if both players are 1st, even though only one is 'highlighted'
 Jelafo: Ah, you are right,! Great, thanks!
 Jelafo: I did only look at the highlighting
 MSmits: KalamariKing often when you win a board, it's gives the opponent an advantage. MCTS bots do smart stuff. If your bot can win with a certain square, the opponent will tend to make the board that this sends him to, is a good board for him to play on
 MSmits: so often you're trading wins
 MSmits: or postponing winning a board, because the alternative is better
 MSmits: however, it does seem to help a bit if you favor winning mini-boards in the random rollout
 MSmits: but the gain is marginal
 Butanium: having hard time debugging my power 4 MCTS
 Butanium: it's soooo frustrating
 MSmits: power 4?
 Butanium: *connect 4
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: mcts is hard to debug
 MSmits: i think it's mostly hard because you code a lot at once and then hope it works. Not much room for unit testing
 Butanium: yup
 Butanium: at least I know which parts break
 Butanium: but not why
 MSmits: which language?
 Butanium: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/kFphJAxG">https://pastebin.com/kFphJAxG</a>
 Butanium: ocaml
 Butanium: at least I have this debug things
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Butanium: And at turn it tries to replace
 Butanium:&#160;;-;
 MSmits: i have no idea what ocaml is
 Butanium: *turn 2
 Butanium: functionnal language which also has an imperative part
 MSmits: oh, sounds cool
 Butanium: yup&#160;!
 darkhorse64: sloow too
 MSmits: well yeah, it's gonna be slow
 Butanium: is 63 000 playouts bad?
 MSmits: if you want to be fast, I guess c, c++ and rust are your only options?
 MSmits: in how much time Butanium?
 Butanium: 90 ms
 MSmits: what is a playout exactly?
 MSmits: how do you define it
 Butanium: random simulation until endgame
 Butanium: when I create a new node
 MSmits: hmm, how many simulations  do you do after you expand once
 MSmits: just 1?
 Butanium: only one
 Butanium: yes
 MSmits: then that's actually quite good
 Butanium: nice&#160;!
 MSmits: surprises me
 darkhorse64: ^
 Butanium: Now I just have to make it works after turn 1
 Butanium: x)
 MSmits: I think most players with c++ dont get much higher than that
 MSmits: the top players do get 2x that
 Butanium: I don't store any arrays for state
 Butanium: just action
 MSmits: yeah thats fine
 Butanium: and I undo them will retropropagation
 Butanium: *while
 MSmits: oh, you can do that, but if you go 10 deep, a simple copy from the root state is faster
 MSmits: faster than 10 undo's
 MSmits: I memcpy it
 Butanium: I see
 MSmits: in minimax you go 1 step back
 Butanium: I may try to change that because my error comes from my undo function x)
 MSmits: in mcts, you go all the way back to root
 jacek: suddenly this puzzle of the week becomes popular
 geppoz: uhm, in connect4 a state can be in 128bits, 2 longs, copying should be faster that any aritm/logic operation
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh its connect4
 MSmits: ohh wait... I think i got confused Butanium, i said 67000 is not bad, but thats for uttt
 MSmits: it's a bit worse for connect4 i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i been working on clobber, similar setup
 MSmits: but still not bad for an obscure (to me) fp/imp language
 MSmits: clobber is cool, but it's hard to get a handle on with mcts. It seems the first few moves are very random
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php can do depth1 90k nodes ... most can, add all the move finders,etc. and his nodecnt is gonna be 10% of that
 MSmits: some comparisons between ocaml and c++. Dunno how much it is worth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/ocaml-gpp.html">https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/ocaml-gpp.html</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits yes, i use depth 2 minmax until i get to last 4 tokens, then full sim to the endgame and its still too slow and I lose
 MSmits: oh, you might be better off just using if else
 jacek: clobber is kinda all or nothing
 MSmits: yeah it's a bit like D&amp;B
 Butanium: I think rust compiler MSmits was initially wrote in ocaml
 MSmits: ohh, rust is comparable to c++
 aCat: this cat want to learn rust!
 aCat: (I tell this myself after every contest)
 aCat: but finally I started reading books ;p
 MSmits: ocaml seems mostly faster than java
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: for some kinds of programs it is
 MSmits: aCat well i guess since CG bench is no longer a thing, more rust doesnt hurt&#160;:)
 aCat: what connection between rust nd benchmark you see?
 jrke: i haven't tried bench till now
 jrke: any link?
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark</a>
 MSmits: aCat rust is different in IDE
 MSmits: so it times out
 reCurse: Not true since I forced their hand :P
 MSmits: apparently
 aCat: yeah
 MSmits: what'd you do reCurse?
 aCat: I was pretty sure it's release everywhere
 jacek: banned rust? :heart:
 reCurse: Abused debug mode to highlight the issue during FC20
 aCat: ^^'
 MSmits: oh
 reCurse: Sometimes it's the only way to get things fixed
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but you dont even use rust :P
 reCurse: Yeah, you can use rust to send some information about debug state to your c++ bot
 reCurse: Stuff like that
 MSmits: oh, you went into fancy mode for this
 reCurse: Then maybe you decide to only use 1ms to simulate debug mode
 reCurse: All hypothetical
 MSmits: good job 
 jrke: jeez finally pytorch got installed in my laptop after 2 days of hard work
 jrke: :rolling_eyes:
 aCat: everyone after nns now&#160;:(
 geppoz: :D
 Nerchio: not me
 Nerchio: yet.
 geppoz: at least we learning something&#160;;)
 aCat: hi&#160;;]
 jacek: oO
 reCurse: Sorry? :P
 aCat: :P
 aCat: I will hve to myself one day
 aCat: but I still not like them too much
 aCat: I mean always prefer evo because I can code everything myself no need to use some huge fancy framerowks
 aCat: with 1000 magic options
 jacek: you can code NNs yourself ~
 reCurse: I coded everything myself for NNs for over a year before that
 Akshat01: can anyone tell me how can we see previous question we have attempted in clash of code
 Akshat01: question only 
 reCurse: Then I just leverage framework when I felt comfortable enough with training concepts
 aCat: good way recurse
 aCat: long and hard ;p
 MSmits: i tried recurses way for a week
 MSmits: got something working, then moved to framework :P
 MSmits: no patience for coding my own libraries for the complex stuff
 reCurse: Maybe you just groked backpropagation much faster than I did
 reCurse: Also not over a year of coding, clarifying :P
 MSmits: well i assume you also coded convolution and such yourself
 reCurse: Yes
 jacek: and yet you were saying there were errors in my method :unamused:
 MSmits: see thats all the stuff i skipped&#160;:)
 reCurse: Thanks for reminding my failings
 MSmits: jacek does this
 Butanium: can I timeout due to out of memory?
 MSmits: though, he hasnt reminded me over a week about that time i paid for a paper
 jacek: like i do for paying for paper
 jacek: ahh
 MSmits: :P
 jacek: Butanium yes
 Butanium: First player (Butanium): Timeout!
 jacek: timeout could be crash
 Butanium: will I have something else than that if that's the case?
 jacek: MSmits dont worry, you were young, inexperienced
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: and they needed the money?
 MSmits: Butanium just try to measure time at various places in your bot, maybe you're measuring wrong or something
 Butanium: No I think it's memory
 MSmits: how much are you using
 MSmits: you get around 8--
 MSmits: 800
 Butanium: By setting the time limit at 1 ms I do 11 turns
 Butanium: otherwise 2
 MSmits: i am not sure how the number of turns depends on the time you said
 Butanium: I'm creating less node
 MSmits: oh you mean you crash after 11
 Butanium: so less memory
 Butanium: yes
 MSmits: ahhh
 Butanium: I tried to keep the tree between turns
 MSmits: so, do you use object pools?
 Butanium: in ocaml that's a recursive type
 PatrickMcGinnisII: connect 4 data that's interesting <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-the-perfect-connect-four-ai-bot-c165115557b0">https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-the-perfect-connect-four-ai-bot-c165115557b0</a>
 MSmits: no, i meant object pools as in giant arrays of reusable nodes
 Butanium: no
 MSmits: it usually makes the bot faster if you do
 MSmits: so that you dont get the garbage collector doing a lot of work for you
 Anonyman: hi, i'm having an issue defining a class in here (i'm coding in python), the program outputs "invalid syntax at Answer.py not in a function on line 10" (10 is the line number of the __init__ of my class)
 Butanium: pastebin.com
 MSmits: I have a 25 million sized node array or something and when i need an index to a different node, i use the array index
 Butanium: paste your code here
 Butanium: oh I see MSmits
 MSmits: when you get to the end of the pool
 MSmits: you go back to beginning
 Anonyman: I paste my code here&#160;?
 MSmits: you either reset the tree, or risk overwriting nodes still in use
 Butanium: at pastebin.com Anonyman
 MSmits: you can paste here and it will autopastebin, if it works, sometimes it doesnt
 MSmits: what i do, almost always, is check whether i have X nodes left in the pool at the beginning of a turn, if it's less than X, i throw away the tree
 MSmits: some games you never need to reset
 MSmits: some games you need to reset more than once
 Anonyman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/e6vqTdFt">https://pastebin.com/e6vqTdFt</a>
 MSmits: but no memory issues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid I'm not a PY guy, but i think your missing an import
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry AntiSquid
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i meant Anonyman
 RoboStac: types go before the  value (eg pos:int = 0)
 Anonyman: thanks for your help PatrickMcGinnisll but i'm not sure about that, because i don't use anything other than sys
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ah sys handles stderr, ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: see i leaned something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: RoboStac got u back
 jacek: Anonyman def __init__(self, name: str, pos: int=0, turns: int=0, prison: bool=False):
 Anonyman: thanks
 Anonyman: i wouldn't have found this stupid mistake
 Anonyman: in french we don't say thank you but "grosse bises sur tes fesses" and it's bioutifoule
 reCurse: o.0
 jacek: BlaiseEbuth is that true?
 Butanium: lol
 Butanium: that's a *hot* thanks
 Anonyman:&#160;;)
 mariushx: hello; does anybody know the theme used in the ide&#160;?
 jacek: dark :v
 mariushx: it is a visual studio modified dark theme
 struct: it is visual studio dark
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm?
 jacek: mHm
 mariushx: on vscode it might be; i was asking for visual studio IDE; i didn't mention, i know
 mariushx: i will probably edit the dark theme; thanks
 struct: my visual studio theme looks the same as the one on cg ide
 mariushx: strange
 Manchi_o6o7: what is the best C IDE
 jacek: notepad.exe
 mariushx: CLion is a good one
 olaf_surgut: Hi
 mariushx: hello
 jacek: ohai
 olaf_surgut: someone know if in CvZ shooter teleport to the the target or he is moving with some velocity?
 olaf_surgut: i want to know because it affects simulation a lot
 jacek: it moves up to 1000 units per turn
 olaf_surgut: shooter is "sliding" or teleporting?
 Scarfield: teleporting
 Scarfield: instant movement for all entities to target pos, or nearest pos within their range
 olaf_surgut: lol, i was calculating shortest distance between two moving objects, and looking for bug. visualization really confused me but i love this game
 Manevilus: hi&#160;:)
 MSmits: olaf_surgut cool... this method is how CG calculates passing a checkpoint btw
 MSmits: so if you get there, you could use this if you want
 MSmits: except checkpoint doesnt move, but... you get the idea
 Sandoramix: hey guys i've got a problem with "Lumen" excercice. When i submit the code, it says that one test is failed because it might be hardcoded. So what does it means by hardcoded? :P
 MSmits: (in coders strikes back, sry)
 MSmits: it means you knew the answer
 MSmits: and just gave it
 MSmits: without using code to solve the problem
 Sandoramix: oh
 Sandoramix: strange
 MSmits: its a possibility, it's not accusing you
 Sandoramix: i think i didn't do that tho&#160;: |
 Scarfield: puzzles can detect that :o
 MSmits: but this is also what would happen if you hardcoded the testcases
 MSmits: your solution is not generalized enough to deal with all cases
 Sandoramix: actually it is, so i'm a little disappointed
 MSmits: let me look at my lumen solution sec, this was one of my python practice puzzles
 Sandoramix: yeah i used python too
 jacek: no timeouts?
 Sandoramix: no
 Sandoramix: firstly i thought it was beacause of use of classes, so i removed them, but it still gives me the fail
 MSmits: eh not sure if i can help you. I have no idea what i did. Solution is 30 lines and part of it is:
 MSmits: for i in range(n): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5d7919a-d213-4149-810f-244c63002ec9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5d7919a-d213-4149-810f-244c63002ec9</a>
 MSmits: sooo... i dont know what i did :P
 KiwiTae: so many loops
 MSmits: want me to send it to you Sandoramix?
 Scarfield: recursive nesting
 Scarfield: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 KiwiTae: MSmits looks like i did the same &gt;&lt;
 Sandoramix: yeah, if you tell me how to&#160;:) 
 jacek: nestfield
 Sandoramix: can i just copy paste it here?
 MSmits: sec
 Scarfield: made a quick and dirty connect 4 yesterday. thought i would improve it today, and somewhere i hid a bug i cannot find&#160;:'(
 MSmits: i would not share a hard puzzle solution, but you say you solved it 
 Scarfield: :scream:
 MSmits: i remember thinking how easy it was when i solved it :P
 Scarfield: UTTT is not a hard puzzle either :innocent:
 MSmits: Sandoramix i cant pm you for some reason
 MSmits: do i need to follow him?
 KiwiTae: smth like that
 MSmits: aww fine
 Scarfield: to pm you need to follow each other
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: wiw
 jacek: no
 Scarfield: no?
 MSmits: people spam me though
 jacek: click on chat
 MSmits: and i dont follow them
 Scarfield: im noob then
 jacek: click on nick avatar on chat
 MSmits: oh i was clicking on profile pic
 MSmits: but you need to click the name
 Scarfield: you forgot to click my name and paste UTTT solution :p

 jacek: oops, it meant to be pm
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: ah well enjoy your legend
 mariushx: what you call that&#160;? chinese programming&#160;?
 Scarfield: C朞
 Scarfield: its a way to compress code, since there is a 100k char limit on code size in CG
 KiwiTae: anyway to encode bytes in utf32?
 jacek: dunno but they would count more than 1 char
 KiwiTae:&#160;:(
 mariushx: what would be the use for that&#160;?
 KiwiTae: more weights
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt;
 jacek: bigger NN in code
 densch: hey, has someone here done the beach volleyball thing before?
 Westicles: densch, yes
 densch: I am wondering about which way to solve this is intended. like I could go ahead and plg in every possible beachx value into a time function and looks for which one the time is the snmallest. and be a physics geek, do some derivative stuff and find a formula for the perfect beach x. and jsut make it a one liner.
 Westicles: One guy solved it in O(1) by deriving the formula, but most just do binary search. 
 densch: I'll just try through every possible x value, using the perfect formula would feel too cheap&#160;:-)
 geppoz: yes I did
 geppoz: it is a 4° equation
 Westicles: and there's the one guy&#160;:)
 densch: But I wanna be the Guy!&#160;:'O
 geppoz: equ4thGrade(1,0,-(X*X/2+(hL-kW)/d),(hL+kW)*X/d,(X*X/4-(hL-kW)/d)*X*X/4)
 geppoz: that are the coefficient of the equation
 geppoz: *5 coefficients
 densch: wow, that looks ugly&#160;:-)
 dakkshnand: hello
 densch: hi
 densch: huh, it timed out for the forth test case&#160;:-D
 Westicles: yeah, that's where the binary search comes in
 densch: hm, what was binary search again?&#160;:-)
 jacek: oO
 densch: jk&#160;:-D
 densch: but I gotta rethink my concept now. currently I jsut go through the different x values by a simple for loop
 MSmits: keep a maximum and minimum value of where the target can be and choose the middle
 MSmits: thats all it is
 MSmits: if it's 2D, keep them for both x and y
 MSmits: jump to the middle for either
 Smelty: interesting
 MSmits: i heard binary search and just assumed batman
 MSmits: might be way off here
 jacek: batary search?
 MSmits: sure why not
 MSmits: buttery search

 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, need some Python help. I want to plot a real time graph, where I know the x coordinate of the graph, but my y coordinate should the intensity of the pixel where I hover with my mouse. Hope you understand my question.

 1rre: Oof I stayed up lateUnfortunately my C memory management is just as bad as it was
 vovka42rus: jimmy neytron?
 1rre: does anyone have experience with a program hanging on calloc?I searched around but all I can find is something from 2004 which I don't think applies in my case
 vovka42rus: нет
 PatrickMcGinnisII: post code 1rre
 1rre: I mean there's a lot of code &amp; it's a bit janky, but this is where the issue is:
 nuggetbucket54: jimmy neutron has such a nice haircut
 nuggetbucket54: it's like donkey kong's
 1rre: I've gone through &amp; made sure there's no memory leaks, but the issue is only when there's a lot of calls to that function - it could just be timing out but I'd be fairly surprised given it's C
 nuggetbucket54: okay but jimmy neutron is hot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sometimes calloc only has a small buffer
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on compiler options
 PatrickMcGinnisII: put a free(dest-&gt;items); before it and rretest
 1rre: Weirdly maybe the issue isn't the calloc even though it hangs there, it still hangs even if I assign a 8 item array in the struct instead of a pointer
 1rre: I get double free - I initially thought it was because dest-&gt;items could be uninitialised but even if I set that to 0 for new items &amp; free it for old ones it's the same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: while(*c++);
 PatrickMcGinnisII: infinite loop
 1rre: yes are you dissing my c
 1rre: it's not
 1rre: it's classic C - the pointer is incremented after the value is taken so it's basically a "foreach char in a string" thing
 1rre: I know it's pretty janky though
 1rre: I've been doing too much code golf haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's an infinite loop
 1rre: I think I'm gonna go to bed now though
 1rre: I promise you it's not
 1rre: Or actually after being so confident
 1rre: I think in my tiredness I got it mixed up with something else oops
 1rre: oh no I just forgot to set the fprintf to stderr
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You should just split the string into an array, then do what you have to
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, glhf, i super tired too
 1rre: Yeah it's not an infinite loop it's cool
 1rre: if I do: while(*c++) {fprintf(stderr,"%c",*c);}I get: ISH�HOPPED_STRAWBERRIES�CE_CREAM�allocatedISH�CE_CREAM�LUEBERRIES�allocatedISH�CE_CREAM�LUEBERRIES�HOPPED_STRAWBERRIES
 1rre: it's mangled I know but that's because it's not meant to be read
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so it goes until a 0 is reached
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i get it
 1rre: Yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well at first i thought you had a variable scope issue with dest
 1rre: idk seems unlikely, I think I really need some sleep for more important things though aha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can count=0?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: find a better way to split the string
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gl, i'm out

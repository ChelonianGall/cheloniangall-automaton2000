 hex.master8: this guy is
 hex.master8: 9999th
 hex.master8: LOL
 hex.master8: im impressed
 MSmits: he's 9999th because he doesn't understand binary
 MSmits: :P
 kovi: 9999 is still top5%
 MSmits: I meant, if he understood binary, he would have tried to be 32767th or 16383th or something
 aramdov: interesting
 aramdov: i was looking at the permissions websites have in my google chrome browser and codingame was copying my clipboard randomly?
 aramdov: thanks so much for user privacy!
 jeffkubler: interesting

 tutubalin: what happens if contribution gets only 1 approval when time to validate ends? is it accepted or rejected?
 MatasPowerPointPro: plasau
 MatasPowerPointPro: hi guys
 MatasPowerPointPro: what are you doing guys
 Bandiulis: hello
 GabrieliusKaubrys11: hello i have zalgiris virus

 shredyz: alio kur skola
 Abduljabar: hey guys can you speak english?
 Neklausiau: nebaisiai
 Abduljabar: okay
 pardouin: I don't know tutubalin, I've seen contributions with only 2 approvals but they were old so maybe it was an old rule
 pardouin: I just approved the fibonnacci one so maybe he'll have his 3rd validation in time anyway
 [CG]Thibaud: tutubalin pardouin it goes back as a draft for the author and the approval votes are lost
 pardouin: ok
 pardouin: is it ok to advertise its own contrib on the forum&#160;? cause I got one that ends in 3 days and no feedbacks yet so I'm a bit worried ^^"
 nnovich-OK: If time to approve contribution ends, it's automatically rejected, but it's ok, because author can immediately re-publish it.
 MadKnight: yea but he loses all the approvals
 MadKnight: [CG]Thibaud why don't u sort the contribs by days left and mark those that have less than 5 days for example&#160;?
 darkhorse64: They are sorted this way already
 [CG]Thibaud: pardouin I wouldn't remove such a post but if everyone does that, the forum won't be usable.
 MadKnight: and some kind of a small note in the header of website saying like 'contrib needs your response asap!"
 darkhorse64: @pardouin: I have looked at your contribution some time ago but I am unconvinced. It's certainly not a piece of junk but it's too light content-wise
 [CG]Thibaud: actually the red notif could indicate the ones that don't have much time left to be validated instead of the new ones :thinking_face:
 [CG]Thibaud: puzzles take longer to validate, it's difficult to motivate people to look into it
 MadKnight: yea but then u would need to change the icon so it would be intuitive that it means the ones that don't have much time left 
 MadKnight: because the red circle just doesn't do it 
 Passifi: Holy smokes shortest mode counts all the generated code and the comments as characters oO jesus so much wasted chars in so many battles...
 MadKnight: lol
 pardouin: and spaces too&#160;! well now you won't do that same mistake again ^^
 MadKnight: of course it counts that didn't u notice the counter in the bottom right corner Passifi&#160;?
 Passifi: well I didn't ^^ 
 MadKnight: darkhorse64 why didn't u leave a comment under the contrib? or u dud?
 MadKnight: did*
 pardouin: you can indente it as you would normally do and spam shift+tab in the end ^^
 MadKnight: yea they use a 4-char whitespace instead of a tab character
 darkhorse64: Yep, I should have done that
 MSmits: comments in shortest mode :grin:
 Passifi: I always write a little message to my self #You're fierce, powerful and fearless.  as a comment to get myself hyped :P
 MSmits: #stop talking to yourself, score is dropping!
 tutubalin: in shortest mode on Python i use 1-space indent, and usually try to get rid of extra lines inside blocks using semicolon
 AntiSquid: actions speak louder than words
 Passifi: in coding all our actions are words...
 Passifi: I think this breaks the transitive property. A fresh new way to create a paradox to destroy AIs who've gone mad *takesnote*
 tutubalin: if contribution gets 3 approvals does it still wait until end of 30 days period, or approved instantly?
 MadKnight: ofc no 
 MadKnight: now i think u are trolling
 MadKnight: yea let's wait more days so that people change their mind and get to 4 declines
 Theino: the only way to know is if people give me two more approvals for my contribution
 Theino: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63618707a685d8557571cabb82f9ed5b28d9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63618707a685d8557571cabb82f9ed5b28d9</a>
 Theino: clearly the logical thing to do&#160;:)
 tutubalin: MadKnight i remember times when there were group of friends approving each other, which resulted in a bunch of bad-worded puzzles.
 Theino: I should feel ashamed, but when the quest map says you need one more upvote... Honestly, its amazing how much the quest map has motivated me to do things on this site
 tutubalin: pardouin i'm looking at your contrib. the hardest thing is that i have to solve it before approving&#160;:)
 pardouin: thanks
 pardouin: it's not that hard, I wanted to label it medium initially
 pardouin: it shouldn't take you too long&#160;:)
 derjack: contributions should be divided into categories ~
 darkhorse64: clash/others&#160;?
 derjack: yes, trash/others
 darkhorse64: do you request an auto reject feature&#160;?
 derjack: eeyup
 darkhorse64: 3 people checking the box. No more CoCs
 darkhorse64: Not sure CG will approve :grin:
 AntiSquid: obv CG likes clash, that's why it's there
 Astrobytes: I propose 3 categories. Trash, Puzzle and 5%
 AntiSquid: makes sense ^
 BlaiseEbuth: I agree. But only if "approve contribution" is changed to "move to trash" for clashs.
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AntiSquid: reminds me of the times people post clash invites and questions during contests
 AntiSquid: one couldn't be any more tone deaf
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Or puzzle of the week questions...
 Astrobytes: They should disable that in contest times. Or have an 'opt in' option.
 BlaiseEbuth: Disable questions, and let me troll in peace.
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 magaiti: what's wrong with questions or clashes during contests?
 magaiti: itsnot like you have to pay attention to them if you dont want to
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, we're just moaning needlessly&#160;;)
 magaiti: figured as much
 AntiSquid: well imagine someone bringing their harmonica at the cinema during the movie
 AntiSquid: and playing it .
 Theino: Are you comparing playing coc during a contest to playing a harmonica at the cinema?
 Theino: I like it, the imagery make me laugh
 MSmits: perfect analogy
 MSmits: mowing the lawn of the soccer field during the world cup finals
 Astrobytes: Actually reminded me of that video with a helmetless Darth Vader, only every sound he makes is from a harmonica.
 MSmits: funny
 MSmits: I suggested to a student he try to solve bender 4
 MSmits: I didn't know only 41 out of  800+ people who tried it, solved it 100%
 Astrobytes: Did he do it?
 MSmits: I guess it's kinda hard :grin:
 MSmits: still working on it
 MSmits: he made a flowchart
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's not the easiest!
 Astrobytes: Cool. At least he's gonna give it a shot
 MSmits: maybe if i have time over the weekend I'll try to get 100%
 MSmits: easy CPs
 MSmits: well if i finish it that is
 Astrobytes: It's been on my list for a while
 kovi: there are tricky cases
 MSmits: not if i get stuck&#160;:)
 derjack: try space maze
 MSmits: space maze not worth cp&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, XP only
 derjack: who cares about cp
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ^
 MSmits: well not you, you're just an alt
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: derjack the testpony
 derjack: AutomatonNN where is everypony
 AutomatonNN: could not be there
 Astrobytes: derpjack
 MSmits: i did not know you have a penguin father Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yes. An Ad√©lie one at that.
 MSmits: did you not mean feather?
 Astrobytes: I did in the conversation where someone mistook it for 'father' yes.
 MSmits: ohhh ok, yeah i think i was there, vaguely remember
 MSmits: that was funny
 derjack: hm?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't remember who it was but it was funny.
 MSmits: mmh says on mk's profile he is an android
 MSmits: i should read the profiles more
 MSmits: you learn a lot
 AntiSquid: let's ban all alts
 MSmits: is that what humans evolve into before we go up into space AntiSquid&#160;?
 MSmits: i am referring to your profile pic
 UnnamedCodinGamer: dogs?
 MSmits: not sure, it's a small pic
 Astrobytes: Thought it was a cat in a flying saucer.
 MSmits: i was thinking it could be an evolved human, because of the text
 MSmits: it doesnt say dogkind or catkind, it says mankind
 derjack: womankind*
 MSmits: any kind of man, woman &lt;null&gt;man, whatever
 magaiti: hooman
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: thats ferengi slang
 MSmits: I got the ds9 reference
 Astrobytes: haha yes MSmits
 MSmits: I think i watched all 7 seasons of that 4 times now
 Astrobytes: Gotta drag out the 'hoo' part
 MSmits: ye
 Astrobytes: I always begrudge watching the first couple of seasons, as they're fairly boring, but they do develop the story somewhat. Gets epic in the last few.
 MSmits: yeah
 derjack: sisko with hair? huh
 UnnamedCodinGamer: MSmits, second in clobber using your method
 MSmits: reminds me of babylon 5 a bit
 MSmits: though thats more epic even
 derjack: clobber method?
 MSmits: gj UnnamedCodinGamer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: nice job&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: gratz UnnamedCodinGamer, strong bot
 UnnamedCodinGamer: rollout method
 UnnamedCodinGamer: nah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is using alien methods&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah I didnt mind sharing it really. There's no bells and whistles in my bot. I just did the bare minimum
 MSmits: I expect more people to pass me
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do not feel comfortable
 MSmits: get a better chair
 MSmits: sometimes putting the monitor higher helps
 UnnamedCodinGamer: just tested to see if higher simulation count helps
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah MSmits
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: for clobber, you should really dive into the math
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it seems so
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am just trying algorithm variations
 MSmits: what i mean is, if you're going to invest in this game, dont bother doing anything other than that next. 
 MSmits: thats your bottleneck, not using math
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do not
 MSmits: same with D&amp;B
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I like algorithms more than math
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 MSmits: without the math its top 10 barely
 MSmits: most people dont use it, but people who do, become unbeatable by people who dont
 UnnamedCodinGamer: makes sense
 MSmits: the only two really mathy games afaik
 MSmits: other board games are about finding the right search algorithm/eval/nn
 MSmits: I liked it in D&amp;B, but it also took loads of time, i dont want to invest that much into 1 game currently
 MSmits: first i want to do bender 4 and nine mens morris
 Astrobytes: Oh btw:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04931.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04931.pdf</a>
 Astrobytes: If you didn't see it already.
 Astrobytes: 2nd MCTS review, released on Monday
 Astrobytes: (prev survey was the 2012 paper)
 derjack: mcts survey?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Thanks to Uljahn who posted it in discord #ru 
 derjack: eww you follow #ru?
 BlaiseEbuth: da
 Astrobytes: I check new posts in most channels.You know, FOMO and all that.
 derjack: FOMO?
 Astrobytes: ...
 Astrobytes: Want me to google it for you too? smh
 UnnamedCodinGamer: fear of missing out
 derjack: youre using some weird acronyms
 Astrobytes: ikr wtf
 derjack: i didnt google fomo because i thought it was cg specific
 ijnhhujhnh: hyybjyb
 Astrobytes: Now that's just nonsense.
 magaiti: lmgtfy
 darkhorse64: re the clobber thread: I am unsure if math is the only way: 1- there are a few heuristics available 2 - I have noticed that endgames are quite deterministic (you have only a few moves that you can play in any order). I stumbled on this when writing the boss, I got more often than not beaten by the random bot and I had to increase the search depth to 10
 darkhorse64: A good search with transpositions for the endgame should do well. Rn my MCTS predicts the outcome 10 to 15 plys before the end
 Astrobytes: Shhh don't tell smits things like that. He'll have the endgames booked in an hour
 AntiSquid: MSmits scarfield was adding cats and memes to avatars, he made this ... added it to support memes
 darkhorse64: MSmits does not need me to google. Usually, he has read the papers before me. He even pays for them :relaxed:. 
 Astrobytes: hahaha, very true :D
 AntiSquid: they are free if you are in academia
 darkhorse64: The endgame comment is for free. I also used his advice for my rollouts (with a slightly less messy code)
 Astrobytes: I think we've all shared useful info re. Clobber recently. Team effort in order to wreck each other. 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: definitely
 darkhorse64: I made the best use of other people's tips
 AntiSquid: i thought the end goal is to make bots that can surpass skynet
 AntiSquid: that are better at taking over the world? ok my joke failed, time for AutomatonNN ping to clear chat
 AutomatonNN: what does it mean with the player?
 derjack: the ultimate goal is some bioengineering
 AntiSquid: the bots redesigning humans?
 derjack: or combining female human dna with cat dna
 derjack: the possibilities are limitless
 AntiSquid: i don't see the appeal in cat ears and cat like behaviour
 AntiSquid: cats can be nasty
 magaiti: boing-engineering, hmm
 AntiSquid: so sexy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/uGms10W">https://imgur.com/uGms10W</a>
 HunterEhrenfeld: why did i click that...
 AntiSquid: ya it's not anime, real life is ... different
 derjack: then dont watch cats movie
 derjack: its... unanny
 derjack: c
 AntiSquid: cats from Dr Monreau's island didn't look great either
 nicola: Dr Moreau.
 nicola: Not Monroe.&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: Doctrix Monroe
 MSmits: I paid for *one* paper
 MSmits: you guys are never letting that go are you&#160;? :P
 Astrobytes: Never :D
 Passifi: So if I make a bot with ML and it then decides the best way to win is to destroy the other players lifes who's then to blame morally once he got them thrown into jail or killed&#160;? I am asking for a friend
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: ask recurse or jacek about nns
 AntiSquid: why, they paid for papers too&#160;?
 Astrobytes: see previous comment
 Passifi: I actually had this thought when I talked to some AI guy and he told me that neural networks already sometimes go on a tangent and start solving subproblems and it then hit me that a really smart bot would possibly just try and learn to cheat&#160;? How would CodinGame react if that happens&#160;? So many questions&#160;;)
 struct: how does a bot cheat?
 struct: At least on CG
 Passifi: he learns how to hack the back end  and manipulates the outcome&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: then every clash would have accidentally done this already by submitting bugged code
 AntiSquid: clasher * is what i meant ... 
 MSmits: i dont think its possible to hack from the input/output scheme all CG puzzles/multis etc. use
 MSmits: it would have to do something weird on compilation
 Passifi: Not saying this will happen any time soon&#160;;) Just found the idea that the AI would try to solve another problem to avoid the orignal one interesting. its something humans do all the time, after all often using up more resources for the secondary problem too&#160;;)
 MSmits: well actually Passifi
 MSmits: it happens all the time
 MSmits: if you create a physics simulation for example
 MSmits: the NN will find your glitch
 MSmits: and abuse it
 MSmits: ML researchers run into it all the time
 ijnhhujhnh:     # target  checkpoint 1
 Passifi: well that would be an example&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i am sure games on CG don't have such corner cases
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M</a>
 AntiSquid: not even double hulk is that bad
 MSmits: best video for what you are talking about Passifi
 MSmits: fun to watch
 MSmits: wait thats the right subject but wrong video, sec
 AntiSquid: why wrong video? those AI were exploiting the environment
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopoLzvh5jY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopoLzvh5jY</a>
 MSmits: this onje
 MSmits: no it's that crappy 2 min paper narrator
 MSmits: you dont want to hear him
 MSmits: this one is better
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: he has amazing video ... MSmits hating accents again&#160;:(
 MSmits: it's not an accent if you're speaking like a robot
 MSmits: you can do that in any language
 Astrobytes: Robotist
 MSmits: sure, i'll take that
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Passifi: Well the OpenAI video gives me such warm documentary vibes&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's the same subject anyway, if you prefer the robot-speak it's fine&#160;:)
 MSmits: i just cant listen to him for more than a minute before i get the urge to throw things
 MSmits: i would just turn off the sound and do auto-subtitles
 MSmits: because the content is super interesting
 AntiSquid: MSmits do these guys sound like robots to you? curious <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/Jwif_nU-rKE?t=829">https://youtu.be/Jwif_nU-rKE?t=829</a>
 MSmits: cant listen now, in the train, no headphones
 MSmits: i'll listen to it later
 MSmits: and possibly throw things
 AntiSquid: just play it on loud speakers, if voice is robotic tell everyone your laptop is talking to you ... ez
 MSmits: will do
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: at home i will do that
 ijnhhujhnh: hi
 derjack: be like those cool kids who have bt speakers and play it loud in buses
 MSmits: people are already on edge in the train, because of covid
 AntiSquid: derjack guess MSmits isn't cool anymore
 derjack: anymore?
 MSmits: I remember one time, before covid, I got into the train with a hoody and i had a cola in a plastic bottle and i opened it, lid exploded off. So many scared faces
 AntiSquid: idk, i'd like to believe he used to be cool 
 AntiSquid: dutch soda bomber
 MSmits: actually, I am at peak coolness. I was less cool in the past
 Astrobytes: Smits is cooler than Bose-Einstein condensate, whatcha talking about
 MSmits: thats really cool
 MSmits: fyi
 Astrobytes: Ultra cool
 AntiSquid: i think trying to shower innocent pasangers in cola is cool, bit anti-social, but cool
 MSmits: I said oops when it happened
 MSmits: did not know what else to say
 Astrobytes: In keeping with the temp I guess we shoudl say Kool
 Astrobytes: *should
 MSmits: I could have said: "dont worry, not a terroris" 
 AntiSquid: maybe it was a sarcastic sounding oops
 MSmits: but thats what a terrorist would say
 Astrobytes: That would have been twice as bad
 MSmits: not sure if it was sarcastic. Sarcastic doesnt work that well when you're covered in cola
 Passifi: I'm pretty sure realizing that a coke explosion doesn't kill anybody the terrorist would just hide his face in shame and say nothing
 Astrobytes: MSticky
 MSmits: well thats mostly what i did Passifi
 MSmits: except for the oops
 MSmits: surprised noone mentioned the fact that a physicist could have guessed the thing would explode
 Astrobytes: Yeah but it's you though
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: ah.. right
 Passifi: a 4 year old child could have guessed that coke explodes
 MSmits: mmh yeah
 Passifi: don't need no degree for that
 AntiSquid: Passifi the top can jump into someone's mouth while they yawn or are about to say something
 Passifi: try putting mentos in it next time
 Passifi: *the next time
 kovi: lovely ai cheat video msmits...from a hungarian guy
 Astrobytes: Yeah, give them something to really be afraid of
 MSmits: I think it was like this. There was this after party work thing after a long day and they were serving cola. I wanted to go home but still get the free cola
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: there's usually water in the bottle
 MSmits: kovi, do you mean the 6 min thing?
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: doesnt he sound more than hungarian to you?
 MSmits: its not just an accent is it?
 MSmits: it's robo-hungarian
 Astrobytes: :laughing:
 MSmits: maybe this is not the same guy, havent listened to this one yet, but 2 min papers always has this guy i think]
 kovi: maybe reading it
 kovi: i havent listened first
 MSmits: ohh ok
 AntiSquid: i think it's the intonation you find strange MSmits
 MSmits: its so monotonous
 darkhorse64: poor zolnai
 MSmits: no variation at all
 MSmits: thats why i say robotic
 AntiSquid: the 2minpaper channel belongs to that guy
 AntiSquid: karoly
 MSmits: there's this guy edward witten, biggest guy in string theory
 kovi: and sub/sentences are split with an equal delay
 MSmits: go listen to him speak
 MSmits: same thing
 MSmits: i cant listen to him either
 MSmits: kovi yeah
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/jZD4x2R4">https://discord.gg/jZD4x2R4</a> if you want to join his discord and inquire about unforgetable voice
 kovi: looking back to further on the chat: mcts paper...is it "our" jacek within the authors?
 MSmits: i think jacek is a talented amateur, but not sure
 MSmits: dont think he wrote those
 Astrobytes: No, I don't believe it is
 struct: Is he an amateur?
 MSmits: AntiSquid lol... i dont really want to insult this guy, it's mainly my issue&#160;:)
 struct: Is he not mobile dev?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 AntiSquid: oh that far back ... so did you click the cat girl picture too kovi&#160;?
 kovi: damn i missed that one
 MSmits: wait are we talking about the aerodynamics paper?
 MSmits: again?
 Astrobytes: Nope.
 MSmits: whew ok
 AntiSquid: Monte Carlo Tree Search:  A Review of RecentModifications and ApplicationsMaciej ≈öwiechowski‚àó, Konrad Godlewski‚Ä†,Bartosz Sawicki‚Ä°, Jacek Ma≈Ñdziuk¬ß
 MSmits: did Konrad die?
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Sorry, all I see is "schneep schneep shneepshneep scheep"
 Astrobytes: MSmits :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Bartosz too but it either happened twice to him or he came back.
 MSmits: yeah whats up with that
 darkhorse64: :upside_down:
 AntiSquid: edward witten does sound a bit weird, but i wouldmn't call it robotic
 MSmits: well just very monotonous also
 MSmits: i am not a language expert, i am probably not using the right jargon
 MSmits: this guy is amazing btw
 MSmits: if you hear other string theorist talk about him it's like they worship the guy
 AntiSquid: for edward witten it sounds like he makes guttural sounds, talks a bit through his nose ... 
 AntiSquid: i can't compare it to the other guy
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: been a while since i heard him, but i got the same urge to throw things
 MSmits: maybe for different reasons
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: Witten's cool tho'
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: maybe masks help muffle the sounds for MSmits
 MSmits: they sure do
 MSmits: when colleagues talk to me through them i just nod and move on
 MSmits: anyway, train arriving ttyl
 Astrobytes: Must remember that one
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit, back later
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/BhdYGYC">https://imgur.com/a/BhdYGYC</a>
 AntiSquid: weird bug
 jrke: lol
 jrke: AUTO + MANUAL = ANNUAL
 deoignition: guys would you rather code in assembly :heart_eyes: or python :poop:
 jacek: yes
 AntiSquid: as opposed to what&#160;?
 -oa-: Assembly is not available, bc codingame is my IDE
 -oa-: so python
 AntiSquid: it's rather in ass or py than x language he didn't mention&#160;!
 -oa-: we need answers
 TBali: why the luxury of assembly when we could do machine language directly?
 -oa-: thats the attitude
 -oa-: i prefer punch cards
 AntiSquid: and 24 hours wait to see if your code even compiled
 TBali: you mean executed? no need to compile.
 AntiSquid: yes
 TBali: could be an interesting sideproject for CG, but with much simpler puzzles only. And I don't think too high attendance could be reached.
 -oa-: could make a game based on little man computer or something similar
 TBali: Not in line the 'target the broad audience' mission
 BlaiseEbuth: Not even 5% would be interested...&#160;:(

 JLukeSkywalker: mine is pretty odd rn, checks for win, then blocks opponents win, otherwise picks random move that doesnt let the opponent win next turn
 JLukeSkywalker: so most moves are still random
 AntiSquid: so much hard work only to get same wood league as me
 JLukeSkywalker: im in 1
 AntiSquid: me too

 AntiSquid: i said it was skillz
 jacek: oh i lost pots by winning with such noob
 AntiSquid: looks like game engine recognizes luck for what it is, learn to play don't rely on luck maybe&#160;?
 derjack: i pushed big by using random bot
 derjack: well not so random, it uses last available action
 JLukeSkywalker: last action might actually be better than full random in connect 4 because would win you a column
 JLukeSkywalker: if opponent is full random
 derjack: always losing to boss yet im above him
 derjack: meh need to break bot
 darkhorse64: That boss is too easy. Let me rewrite it
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, everyone is flying out of wood 2 today
 darkhorse64: derjack: trying to reach earth center&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 Shabari: i am new here
 JLukeSkywalker: welcome
 derjack: hello new here, were dads
 Shabari: where i want to start to code
 JLukeSkywalker: i would just follow the quests on that home page
 Shabari: where to start coding
 JLukeSkywalker: have you coded before?
 derjack: descent, mars lander 1, coding strickes back...
 derjack: :notebook: :soccer:
 Shabari: i know some basic about python
 Shabari: i came here to learn code
 Shabari: where to start
 Shabari: tips??

 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm, here is not exactly the place for learning
 Shabari: ohh
 AntiSquid: press JOIN and hit submit on that link, good start Shadow25
 AntiSquid: Shabari
 Shabari: ok 
 Shabari: tqq
 AntiSquid: no problemo
 JLukeSkywalker: i mean, i would learn from a site like this if i was starting out. I think if he can solve some easy puzzles, this site should be fine
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I would learn some basic algorithms first
 UnnamedCodinGamer: then come here and practice them
 Shabari: any other website to learn coding
 Shabari: where you learn those algorithms
 Shabari:&#160;??
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I used books, youtube tutorials 
 JLukeSkywalker: I just started with a site like this, and when you hit an algorithm you need and dont know, look it up online or books
 Shabari: youtube channel name plz
 JLukeSkywalker: there are infinite
 UnnamedCodinGamer: there are many (some good some not so much)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you have to know what to look for first
 Shabari: i love to code
 Shabari: but i dont to code
 Shabari: i want to learn
 Shabari: plz say any youtube channel to learn
 UnnamedCodinGamer: pick an algorithm, read about it in a book, if you do not understand it, go to youtube or google it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this is what I do
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDJNfV7hjk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDJNfV7hjk</a>
 jacek:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: any youtube channel
 Shabari: lol
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, just search what you want to learn, and pick a random channel until you find one you like
 Shabari: ohh
 Shabari: ok
 AntiSquid: hey gaiz i knew google shitz for me plz
 Shabari: :grinning:
 AntiSquid: this guy teaches coding Shabari&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/3k4kdkW0_9E?t=652">https://youtu.be/3k4kdkW0_9E?t=652</a>  
 JLukeSkywalker: I teach coding
 JLukeSkywalker: just not on youtube tho
 JLukeSkywalker: i hate computers
 jacek: oO
 JLukeSkywalker: whiteboard &gt;&gt; youtube
 jacek: i dont have whiteboard at home
 JLukeSkywalker: sharpie + mirror?
 JLukeSkywalker: ur mom or wife will love you forever for it
 jacek: red sharpie?
 JLukeSkywalker: that would work
 JLukeSkywalker: somehow my c4 checkWin misses it every now and then, but I cant debug it bc everyone is random
 Shabari: tqq
 AntiSquid: sure blame it on skilled players
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 JLukeSkywalker: replays in same conditions, game changes drastically and doesnt have the error im looking for
 JLukeSkywalker: REEEE
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: so [solved]?
 JLukeSkywalker: cant even find it
 JLukeSkywalker: it only happens in list battles
 JLukeSkywalker: big beat me in the list, just manually played him 100 times and didnt lose once
 jacek: lucky eh
 JLukeSkywalker: it broke my win check algo
 JLukeSkywalker: but i cant replicate it to try to fix it
 JLukeSkywalker: gonna have to just start from scratch
 jacek: linux from scratch
 JLukeSkywalker: did a small 16b os from scratch back in college
 JLukeSkywalker: was actually kind of fun
 JLukeSkywalker: final project was to give a power point type presentation using your os
 KelvinAndHubbles: for the earlier conversation, if you want to see some interesting comp sci youtube stuff check o
 KelvinAndHubbles: out 2 minute papers*
 jacek: o my
 Scarfield: 2 min papersoccer
 Astrobytes: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 Astrobytes: Clobbering F****** clobberating clobbertrons
 Scarfield: what up?
 Astrobytes: Everyone elses clobber but and not mine :P
 Astrobytes: *bot
 Scarfield: submitting the wrong one mayhaps? and i know the feeling, my chess bot likes to try h1h1 atm xD
 Astrobytes: It seemed to be working well before I submitted it... 
 Astrobytes: Aha! Never submit.
 Astrobytes: oh lol, sounds like you have something round the way or no move
 Astrobytes: My clobber bot was quite fond of a1a1 for a while
 Scarfield: fixed something else, just got this bug now, but somehow i point to an unset node in some cases
 Astrobytes: that's your h1h1. Time to debug!
 jacek: h1h1? meh
 Scarfield: h1h1q would be a nice move
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: good enough for production then
 ShortBaited: #GoodNightOVH lmao
 Adiz983: hahaha
 Adiz983: haha
 Adiz983: Who are kids in this chat log
 Astrobytes: trictrac: some improvement! Good job. It's like running into a brick wall, however!
 AntiSquid: will never know since he's already deleted lol
 jacek: hm?
 trictrac: my first MCTS working
 kovi: mcts tryangle?
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Astrobytes: trictrac: If you're joining the MCTS then I am too
 trictrac: clobber
 trictrac: It's quite impossible to have a good eval for minmax @ clobber
 Astrobytes: I fear without the correct heuristics (and there may be some) alphabeta will nto work here
 kovi: you minimaxed bandas/uttt?
 Astrobytes: Yes trictrac, exactly
 trictrac: yes all my bot are minmax today
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: Apart from Clobber
 kovi: nice, nn you have then&#160;:)
 trictrac: yes apart clobber&#160;!
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 jacek: nn?
 kovi: between his ears
 Astrobytes: trictrac is the alphabeta master kovi
 Scarfield: the alpha and omega
 kovi: is there an alphbeta0 nn based minmax pruning?
 kovi: im most interested in bandas
 jacek: there are some NN-based moves ordering prototypes. chess folks are experimenting with nn-based nodes pruning
 Astrobytes: Does SF do something with that?
 jacek: yeah, sf guys experiment with that
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I thought I read that somewhere
 jacek: you have razoring, LMR etc. based on some rules. why not let the NN figure those out
 Astrobytes: Yes, prime candidates for nn
 Astrobytes: Why bandas kovi?
 kovi: that seemed without strong heuristics. but maybe trictrac found one
 trictrac: @ bandas, the coef for the eval are learned
 kovi: nice
 Astrobytes: trictrac: nn or probcut?
 trictrac: perceptron&#160;: nn @ one layer
 Astrobytes: Yep, cool. Thanks&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: perceptron = you can adjust the numbers in your conditions by hand and submit spam :P
 AntiSquid: or use brutal tester
 Scarfield: figured out the h1h1 bug, and its working, but still i 7 point leap up to Jachess
 jacek: AntiSquid n-tuples is also perceptron. good luck adjust that by hand
 trictrac: Antisquid, it depends of the number of coef to tune&#160;!!! It can take years of processing power @ CG with spam submit
 jacek: msmits would be: "hold my beer"
 struct: hi
 Scarfield: hey
 Astrobytes: hi struct
 AntiSquid: bruteforce jacek
 Scarfield: if you are a brute, will doing it by hand be bruteforce :thinking:
 AntiSquid: why by hand&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ffs jacek could you not just have left me at 6/7
 JohnnyHotBody: Hello:smiley::wave:
 k2xl: where can we send in feature requests/suggestions for clash of code stuff?
 jacek: you mean contribute?
 jacek: im so dumb... the reason clobber nn didnt learn at all was i gave it faulty target
 Astrobytes: jacek: Faulty target?
 jacek: for proven positions i always gave it -1
 jacek: instead of wins = 1 and loses = -1
 Astrobytes: :clap:
 AntiSquid: k2xl <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/3F41gb6">https://imgur.com/a/3F41gb6</a> 
 jacek:&#160;:?
 Astrobytes: wth does that have to do with feature requests/suggestions for coc?
 AntiSquid: huh? why did i need to answer coc stuff&#160;? answer forums k2xl ...
 AntiSquid: do *
 jacek: because youre the helpful mod
 Astrobytes: Then what am I jacek?
 MSmits: The spawn of a penguin
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: You've been on good form today MSmits
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: reference to pengu game? 
 MSmits: read Astrobytes profile
 MSmits: one time he said in the chat he has a penguin feather
 MSmits: and someone misread it
 MSmits: dont remember who, could be me
 MSmits: was funny anyway
 Astrobytes: It may have been you, but I don't remember either.
 Astrobytes: Oh feck, penguins, totally forgot about that game.
 Astrobytes: I need a secretary or something.
 MSmits: same, its a cool game, so much else to do
 AntiSquid: it's ok no need to check on me, i am fine
 MSmits: Astrobytes is this a British thing, does he want us to check on him?
 Astrobytes: I have no idea what AntiSquid is referring to
 MSmits: allright gonna go back to work, got a deadline tomorrow. Have to write some stuff
 MSmits: gn in advance
 Scarfield: gn
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits, good luck with the stuff&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: aCat made a chess-based Solo Game, and linked to the chess multi in the statement
 AntiSquid: gn8
 AntiSquid: so book of chess endings&#160;! :O
 AntiSquid: hm. or not
 UnnamedCodinGamer: gn
 Astrobytes: Are you saying gn to Smits or us UnnamedCodinGamer?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: to MSmits
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid no, it's quite specific
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am looking at connect4 bitboards
 AntiSquid: ya noticed afterwards
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: or better said looking for&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: Once I switch to MCTS I am coming for you in Clobber :P
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you are welcome
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do not intend to try new things for now
 Astrobytes: I tried a bunch of new things in a/b minimax that's for sure
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I want to try to implement what I learned on another game
 Scarfield: but have you done it without using recursion-resmursion :p
 Astrobytes: I did not use ClobberfieldScarfomax no
 UnnamedCodinGamer: minimax seems to do bad in clobber
 k2xl: Suggestion (to any devs for codingame), huge fan of the site. Love the clash of code. It would be cool if when mousing over a user's avatar that it showed their clash of code leaderboard ranking (when playing clash of code)
 Astrobytes: Yes UnnamedCodinGamer, neither trictrac nor myself have come up with many viable heuristics for the evaluation function
 Astrobytes: So any enhancements are only effective to a small degree
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 AntiSquid: see&#160;? i answered that's best to post on forums, no effect
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this seems like a lot of coding 
 Astrobytes: TTs, altering search windows, move ordering with various methods
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: Connect4?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: maybe some pruning would help, but I guess you will need the maths stuff that MSmits mentioned multiple times
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes I am looking at connect4
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I want to start with the bitboards
 Astrobytes: Well the move ordering, TTs and search window alterations all contribute to pruning. But without a good eval it's not much use against stronger MCTS bots.There are heuristics but I have yet to understand the paper, if I'm totally honest.
 Astrobytes: re Connect4: it's just the usual uint64 bitboards?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes it should be
 UnnamedCodinGamer: there are 63 cells
 Astrobytes: yeah, just mask off the appropriate cells and you're good to go
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I just started with bitboards and admittedly clobber was easy
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this seems more complicated
 Astrobytes: Since i'm a little tired atm I won't go into much detail but there are a bunch on intrinsic functions you can use to make life easier
 Astrobytes: *a bunch of
 UnnamedCodinGamer: no problem
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will figure it out
 Astrobytes: Not just figure it out, talk about it in chat tomorrow
 UnnamedCodinGamer: sure
 UnnamedCodinGamer: go get some rest
 Astrobytes: There's a whole load of ways to do this stuff, Smits is a good one to ask
 Astrobytes: Yes, gn UnnamedCodinGamer and everyone else 
 Scarfield: gn
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will ask if I see that my implementation is slow (which it probably will)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: gn
 Astrobytes: We try to help each other get the best bots as possible to wreck each other with, like I said earlier&#160;:)gn!
 k2xl: AntiSquid sorry, i missed your suggestion about the forums. i shared on the forums just now. thanks
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes you sound adorable
 BigDo: who knows python3
 Nachosauce: I know a tiny bit, certainly no expert though
 BigDo: I need a python 3 master.
 creeperZnation4:  what for?
 BigDo: i really need to improve my python3 
 void_main_sucks: are interpreted languages real programming languages
 Binary_Sky: i code only in python for clash of code but I don't have lots of experience
 creeperZnation4: Then I would suggest looking at other python3 submissions in gamemodes like clash of code or other programming things
 creeperZnation4: you'd be surprised to see how much you'll pick up XD
 Binary_Sky: indeed
 Binary_Sky: lol
 BigDo: who can build a webapp
 BigDo:&#160;?
 Binary_Sky: i can only build ios app
 Nachosauce: I'm aiming for top 1% global this weekend :D I have no idea how I'm even getting close but hey I'll take it
 Wontonimo: Nachosauce good luck!  
 Wontonimo: check your DM
 Lucky45: hello fellow humans 
 AGroatEatingGoat: sup
 Binary_Sky: hello
 void_main_sucks: hello
 AGroatEatingGoat: Lol, I misread the problem
 Binary_Sky: is c# good for clash of code

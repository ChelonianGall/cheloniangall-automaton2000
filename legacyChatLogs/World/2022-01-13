 CinnamonSwirl: how do i loop
 CinnamonSwirl: im so bad
 ASM_MOV_INT: how do you do anything that you don't know in programming? google my friend, google
 CinnamonSwirl: i dont get what google is telling me
 ASM_MOV_INT: google better.
 ASM_MOV_INT: :sunglasses:
 CinnamonSwirl: ok
 ASM_MOV_INT: cinnamon swirl sounds yum
 nickheyer: some of these promps are very poorly written
 nickheyer: and the implementation in C is VERY confusing, given all the existing code used to interface with the program.

 Mr.Moxy: in the death first search episode 1 how can i refresh the agent's position after it moves? (Python)
 BlaiseEbuth: That's probably np-hard...
 Mr.Moxy: it must be easy otherwise you couldn't solve this
 5DN1L: Mr.Moxy it's given to you every turn via input()
 Mr.Moxy: yea, but for some reason the code doesn't refreshes the position after the agent moves
 5DN1L: what do you mean?
 Mr.Moxy: it keeps the starting positon
 5DN1L: what does your console show?
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to refresh the var yourself.
 Mr.Moxy: it doesn't throw error, i just know that it's not right
 Mr.Moxy: ok but how?
 5DN1L: Do you store the input() in a variable?
 Mr.Moxy: yes
 5DN1L: Then I don't understand your issue
 BlaiseEbuth: Can you show us your code? 
 Mr.Moxy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/acbd8c45-7139-4961-be49-0e9b4f40aaba">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/acbd8c45-7139-4961-be49-0e9b4f40aaba</a>

 5DN1L: You do not necessarily print every turn?
 5DN1L: or is it possible you print more than once every turn?
 Mr.Moxy: neither
 Mr.Moxy: you have to print only one each turn
 5DN1L: and why random?
 Mr.Moxy: turn=agent moves
 Mr.Moxy: coz that part doesnt matter
 BlaiseEbuth: But you read si multiple time each turn
 Mr.Moxy: if i wouldn't there would be an error
 Mr.Moxy: but ok
 Mr.Moxy: there you go

 IAmTriste: hbgbng
 IAmTriste: e
 5DN1L: IAmTriste no testing of your keyboard here
 IAmTriste: thhth
 5DN1L: one more time and you're out
 BlaiseEbuth: The statement clearly say that you get SI once by turn, and you read it multiple times in your while.
 BlaiseEbuth: Each while turn correspond to one game turn.
 BlaiseEbuth: Since your print are in another loop in this while, you probably print multiple times in one turn, as 5DN1L said.
 BlaiseEbuth: You should have one print at the end of the while loop. No more.
 5DN1L: Mr.Moxy I think you need to figure out something more complex to determine what to output
 Mr.Moxy: alright, thank you for your help guys :D

 Wontonimo: what's deltarune&#160;?
 5DN1L: some rpg
 prozacian: its a videogame
 ninjadip: i guess a game he likes
 jacek: onitama?

 Wontonimo: oh, rpg.  Rocket Propelled Grenades 
 Wontonimo: love those things
 Jacxk: deltarune is undertale 
 prozacian: oh lol
 prozacian: ya 
 prozacian: kinds
 Jay_minecraft: no hes not playing a game hes drawing
 Jay_minecraft: he's
 Jacxk: prequel kinda thing
 prozacian: y
 prozacian: UA
 prozacian: wtf sorry 
 Wontonimo: so, grenades just use a parabolic path, kinda easy physics
 prozacian: ya*
 prozacian: ohhhhhhhh ok thx 
 Jacxk: Wontonimo I finally finished Code Breaker it took me the whole day tho :sweat_smile:
 Luis_Marmol: Wontonimo never thrown a grenade in a windy day, huh?
 Wontonimo: but seriously though, what kind of effect are you going for?
 prozacian:  bit by bit movment
 Jay_minecraft: Python3 is the easiest 
 prozacian: ik i could use a bitboard buttttt i dont want to
 prozacian: ohhhh thx
 Jay_minecraft: np
 prozacian:&#160;:) 
 jacek: bitboard?
 prozacian: uh ya like the program that moves items in a board game 
 prozacian: but i could mess around with that and change it to move sprites
 schloppy: mornin
 prozacian: hello
 Wontonimo: you may be interested in something called "lerp function" prozacian.  That's something you can google
 jacek: derp function?
 Wontonimo: there are lots of variations on lerp, like using sin or tanh or some other non-linear function
 Wontonimo: to make a rubberband like effect
 prozacian: thx wontonimo
 prozacian: this helps alot&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: what programming language are you using prozacian?  If you are making this for the web you can make these effects using CSS
 prozacian: im using bash and c#
 Jay_minecraft: Bash is the hardest.
 prozacian: i still suck at it 
 prozacian: but i usually use c#
 Jay_minecraft: Pythone3 And java are the easy one
 Jay_minecraft: Python3
 Wontonimo: I'd say javascript is easier than java
 prozacian: i know i still need to learn how to do all this 
 prozacian: ya i want to use java script but im still learing
 prozacian: ya know 
 Wontonimo: to be clear&#160;: java and javascript are very different!  saying "java script" is just plain confusing
 jacek: kree java!
 prozacian: oh ok 
 BadBurger: i got some background in python, played bitburner, its a hacking game you automate with coding in js. first i tought it was a simplified version because it looked so much like python :D
 BadBurger: javascript just flows out, shame i didnt look at it before, pretty much anything i can do in python i learned to do in js in couple hours as i got the hang of it.
 Wontonimo: for all the 12yr olds here, if you don't know how to code an if/else and a loop, consider spending some time on scratch.mit.edu and using the if/else and loops there
 Wontonimo: scratch.mit.edu is a lot easier, a lot more fun, and you will actually learn programming concepts
 BadBurger: yeah my son started playing around with scratch, seems boring but im glad he is interested.
 5DN1L: different ages have different definitions of fun
 Wontonimo: here are some challenges to try and do in scratch.mit.edu&#160;:
 Wontonimo: make a sprite follow the mouse, but slowly
 Wontonimo: make a sprite "fall" at a constant speed from the top of the screen down when the game is played
 Wontonimo: make a sprite move up/down/left/right when the arrow keys are pressed
 Wontonimo: put a larger sprite behind it that looks like a mountain, and make it also move but a bit slower,
 Wontonimo: this makes a parallax effect 
 Wontonimo: make the up arrow make the sprite also shrink, and the down arrow also make the sprite grow.  this gives a perspective effect
 Justin_Lowry: i just learned what infitie geometric is from one of the clash of code games 
 5DN1L: :thumbsup: (apart from the spelling)
 USSR_Chicken: hello
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: 12yr olds?  we are 13 thank you very much

 5DN1L: the puzzle statement contains an example
 Jacxk: but only  to econde it
 5DN1L: for decoding you do the other way round?
 Jacxk: i tried
 Jacxk: didnt work
 Jacxk: maybe i just did it wrong
 USSR_Chicken: look over it
 USSR_Chicken: i mess up a lot because i forget something like a single comma
 SpeedDragon: can you submit more than one file for ur anwser on puzzles? for example im using java and i wanted to create a diferent class for the data struture that im using
 jacek: only 1 file
 SpeedDragon: okay ty
 jacek: but you can use multiple classes in 1 file in java
 SpeedDragon: yes i know it was more for organising purposes
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: ah, only one more approval needed for wont's ascii art puzzle
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: guess I better try it
 USSR_Chicken: update: you tried it
 Jacxk: 5DN1L FYI, I got it, I just didn't think hard enough

 5DN1L: Automaton2000 have you learned any new coding knowledge recently?
 Automaton2000: coming up with a good scoring
 5DN1L: nice
 RCroboticsteam: for some reason there's a bug where when I play my code while a game is already displayed the game just freezes and won't run until I reload the page.  I just ignored it for a long time but it seems like it should have been patched by now
 5DN1L: yeah that happens sometimes
 5DN1L: when in doubt, refresh
 RCroboticsteam: ok, I will keep doing that
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I think Blaise mentioned it isn't a short-term priority
 5DN1L: then it's a long-term priority, or it's not a priority at all?
 5DN1L: Le_petit_roux What's your problem of Mad Pod Racing?
 5DN1L: Le_petit_roux Looks like the thrust part is giving you a problem?
 Le_petit_roux: so i can't get out of the 2 one its says trust dosent mean anything and how do you make a new command without breaking the other one
 5DN1L: you print x, y and thrust every turn
 5DN1L: you don't have other commands
 5DN1L: it looks like the variable thrust you've printed may be wrong
 Le_petit_roux: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " " + str(thrust))
 5DN1L: what value does thrust contain?
 Le_petit_roux: but thrust dosent mean anything
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker. Like everything that isn't "Make money", "Chase away the old regulars" and "Escape games".
 Le_petit_roux: the boost
 5DN1L: Le_petit_roux What's the code you used for setting the value of the thrust?
 Le_petit_roux: i dont know
 5DN1L: Hmmm?
 5DN1L: I mean what you've written
 Le_petit_roux: know trust dosent have value
 5DN1L: Your code has to give it a value
 Le_petit_roux: aand i want to know how we make that the thrust have value
 5DN1L: Are you in Wood 3 or Wood 2 now?
 Le_petit_roux: wood 2
 5DN1L: OK
 Le_petit_roux: why
 5DN1L: There should be a hint in the puzzle statement

 Le_petit_roux: this
 5DN1L: yes, that's right
 5DN1L: you have to convert that to python
 5DN1L: and put it in your code
 Le_petit_roux: how
 5DN1L: by doing that you set thrust a value
 5DN1L: have you learned python before?
 Le_petit_roux: nope
 5DN1L: That's an issue...
 5DN1L: You see, this website is more for practising than learning from zero
 Le_petit_roux: well can you recommande me a chat
 5DN1L: recommend you a chat?
 5DN1L: what do you mean
 Le_petit_roux: like python java javascript 
 Le_petit_roux: c
 Le_petit_roux: c++
 Le_petit_roux: bash
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 5DN1L: if you know other languages you can switch to any of those, as long as it's offered on CodinGame :shrug:
 Le_petit_roux: ok
 5DN1L: but in any case, you've got to know the basics first
 Le_petit_roux: ok

 codergautam: Can someone help me understand what that means
 codergautam: I am creating a clash of code puzzle
 p.p.o.p.: I got started learning programming through making games in Unity. Do I have to look at the C# documentation for each bit of code that I use in Unity to see if it is in the C# library, or can I assume that everything I use there that doesn't require a specific library can be used anywhere?
 codergautam: Well
 codergautam: You shouldn't
 codergautam: some can be specific to unity
 codergautam: But i believe you should be able to use unity specific modules if you import the corresponding file for it
 p.p.o.p.: okay. Thank you

 p.p.o.p.: As in how to design my programs more simply...right now the deeper I go into making a game the more chaotic it gets
 p.p.o.p.: and the slower I become
 5DN1L: Practice may help but not directly relevant in my opinion
 p.p.o.p.: Okay. Thank you!
 p.p.o.p.: I definitely need the practice too, I'm a novice, but I feel that is my greatest weakness!
 5DN1L: then try to practise structuring your code at the same time as solving the puzzles
 p.p.o.p.: Okay. As you go deeper into this do you set up different classes etc.?
 5DN1L: depends on the complexity of the problem
 5DN1L: and the need
 Iron_Snow7: Hi guys, Anyone willing to help with a bit of C# let me know :smile:
 p.p.o.p.: alright. Wow, every question I have someone answers right away. I really appreciate it!
 5DN1L: depends on the day of time lol
 5DN1L: or time of day
 5DN1L: oops
 Smelty: augh im getting nullpointerexception when testing if it is null
 jacek: then the test failed or succeded?

 Smelty: it succeeded because another part of the code solved the problem while another section was throwing the error
 Smelty: ok fixed npe and now the program is just failing
 Lucas2506: hey
 Corvus001: hello
 Smelty: hello
 BlaiseEbuth: hell
 Smelty: *sighs* my bitmap of 0s and 1s are returning values like -990
 BlaiseEbuth: 'bitmap of 0s and 1s' :3
 Wontonimo: p.p.o.p. you said that the deeper you get into a program the slower development goes.  Consider micro tests and unit tests
 Wontonimo: p.p.o.p. check out these two links<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148</a>
 Wontonimo: and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/qlqIYmS">https://tech.io/snippet/qlqIYmS</a>
 Wontonimo: although these are in python, I'm sure you get the idea behind it.  After you write a small function also write something that checks to make sure it is doing what you expect and otherwise exit the program
 Wontonimo: one of the key benefits is that your code gets tested right at program start instead or having to use your program to recreate the edge case you want to test.
 BadBurger: Light Bulbs practice, Rule 1 You can change the state of light bulb i if i+1 is ON AND i+2, i+3,... N are OFF.Rule 2 Rule 1 does not apply to light bulb N, which can be switched ON/OFF at will.
 BadBurger: second map start pos is 11111 . did i misunderstand? rules states only last bulb can be switched at will
 BadBurger: or can i swirch off [3] because [5] does not exist? 
 BadBurger: if [4] is true
 5DN1L: By Rule 1, you can switch off the second last bulb if the last bulb is on
 5DN1L: That's what the author of the puzzle says in the forum...
 BadBurger: ok, so non existent lights are not a factor in the rules, it seemed to be pretty firm that the rule2 only affects the N bulb
 BadBurger: but yeah i get it now. 
 BadBurger: thx
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:

 Smelty: that again
 codeing: Hello. I'm just chealing with a question. Does it exist a way to locate all device connected to my google account&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yes
 codeing: how to do&#160;?
 Wontonimo: log into it and search
 Wontonimo: google it
 codeing: no result for that on google
 5DN1L: you sure?
 codeing: the devices are personal computer and not android
 5DN1L: meaning?
 codeing: yes
 codeing: wanna locate all computers connected to my google account.
 5DN1L: what do you mean by "connected to" anyway
 5DN1L: do you mean "signed in"?

 struct: :wave:
 5DN1L: hi struct
 struct: hi
 codeing: yes sign in
 5DN1L: I think a single page shows both the computers and the mobile devices signed in
 5DN1L: have you tried?
 struct: wdym?
 5DN1L: codeing "You can see computers, phones, and other devices that are currently using or have recently used your Google Account. You can check this info to make sure no one else has signed in to your account."
 struct: ah
 5DN1L: just google it, codeing
 Smelty: Small typo in code golf don't panic, it says "an medium puzzle" in statement
 xargon: anyone got any clues for the goddamn batman 2d array binary search problem?
 5DN1L: read the forum
 xargon: theres a forum now?
 5DN1L: see for yourself
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: anyone tried dancing links on spoon episode 2?
 5DN1L: yes
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it seems like the way to go, but all the hints talk about backtracking
 5DN1L: doesn't dancing links also kind of backtracking?
 5DN1L: isn't*
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh, well yeah but kind of a special case I guess
 ButterMyToast: guess what
 ButterMyToast: wasdfklasf;safj
 ButterMyToast: fsalkfjs;klfjsdkl;fjdsa
 ButterMyToast: so basically
 Be-Ugeen: any idea what can be done to speed up the process
 Be-Ugeen: i need to write million times the same value
 evanwilliams123: use a for loop
 Be-Ugeen: for i in range(len(a)):
 Smelty: how do I solve rounding issues
 Be-Ugeen: i don't need to round, they are all INT values
 Smelty: i.e when i put in 8/(3-(8/3)) in, it doesnt return remotely close to 24
 Smelty: oh and they are doubles
 Smelty: not ints
 C26_1: divide something will always give you double
 Nachosauce: I'm too impatient haha. I hate waiting for all the battles to finish when I submit code in the AI challenges
 omboyo: (x*256)%67==36 ,is it possible to find x?
 Nachosauce: Assuming&#160;% is mod, I believe there would be multiple possible solutions for x? 
 Nachosauce: 64, 131, 197, 265, 332 are the first 5 solutions
 omboyo: hmm yes that still works actually, the x have to be under 67
 omboyo: thanks
 PATTRIM: the highest i got is 99961
 PATTRIM: 999972
 Nachosauce: There's many many many solutions&#160;:) whip together a quick loop to spit them out. 
 PATTRIM: a=[]for i in range(1,1000000):
 PATTRIM: lol

 Nachosauce: So so many numbers
 ASM_MOV_INT: you could go to maxvalue*256, then increment by 256 each time and eliminate a lot of multiplies
 Smelty: it should eventually loop every 256*67
 Smelty: idk though
 MopishCobra75: Heya
 Smelty: Quote of the day:
 Smelty: “Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”
 KOKKONUT: can someone teach me how to code
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: youtube can help you there
 Wontonimo: google "The coding train youtube"
 KOKKONUT: ok
 henrylang: shiffman :hot_face:
 LinhT.Nguyen: ohh damn bro you're coding train?
 LinhT.Nguyen: ohh nvm i read it wrong hahaha
 Smelty: lmao
 datu12: Dude... KOKONUT go take some classes bro

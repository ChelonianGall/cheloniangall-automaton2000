 Y.Srihari: Hi gayes
 Y.Srihari: Can you help me 
 Y.Srihari: by deliting all
 Y.Srihari: It is so dullcult 
 Y.Srihari: This is your hint
 water_man: Which man has passed?Help me!Thanks!!!
 water_man: This is my code.

 water_man: I can not understand what should I need to do.
 water_man: :grimacing:
 Uljahn: modify your print like this:print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, thrust)
 derjack: alternatively, there is no " " between y and thrust
 LaoFeng: Thanks very much
 Uljahn: you could also use string interpolation like print(f"{x} {y} {t}")
 akashhuyaar: from where should I start leaning algos&#160;??
 akashhuyaar: I mean practice not learning 
 darkhorse64: you could also look at what you emit  and discover it is not consistent with the statement requirements. CG tells you that your output is incorrect. Listen
 derjack: space shooter quadrapled users ~
 It_potato: Hi guys
 ProCoder03: how player do you need to open bronze league in a community multiplayer&#160;??
 Butanium: SDK question&#160;: Is there a difference between setVisible(false) and setAlpha(0) for entities&#160;?
 RickJ: @ProCoder03 Community games only habe wooden league, no matter how many players&#160;:/
 RickJ: have*
 RickJ: and @Butanium: Setting visible to false is faster - that way all event listeners are ignored
 Arcadia17: Hi guys, I have a question. In the profile page there is a certification called "Coding speed". What does it depend on?
 jdsigg: It is directly related to achievements completed in Clash Mode
 CoonCoder: I think it is based on how fast you submit the solution
 CoonCoder: ah;)))
 Arcadia17: Ok thank you
 jdsigg: If you are on your main page, follow the clash of code tree and you'll see little "graduation caps" along its path. Hitting those goals helps you level that up
 jdsigg: np
 TimothyAlexisVass: T_T
 MiyamuraIzumi: when can I gain grandmaster titile&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: too far
 smacker01: how do you even gain grandmaster title?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I think around 40k CP 
 MiyamuraIzumi: Just feel unmotivated with writing simulation
 MiyamuraIzumi: any tips?
 dreadylein: tips about&#160;?&#160;:)
 MiyamuraIzumi: like improve speed to code a simulation
 smacker01: i ma crafter and done nothing but clash of code what tip i can give u
 dreadylein: repetion prettymuch&#160;:) 
 MiyamuraIzumi: It take me alot of time, that why I just feel lazy
 dreadylein: it will get easier after a while
 dreadylein: try to target something you like 
 dreadylein: maybe if you are someone that likes optimization, think about what parts could be done nicer while coding the base
 MiyamuraIzumi: what part could be done nicer?
 MiyamuraIzumi: like I am simulate Marlander for example =&gt; what par for this&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: (I already finish ML, I just want to get some idea, as I take a lot of time for it, that why I just feel lazy after ML)
 dreadylein: multiplayer challenges are nicer as you can work on it and see the benefits of optimization, but overall, trying to save the state of a simulation efficient, caching,  math heavy paths, compare heavy paths, allocations (if you are using a managed language, gc pressure) etc
 dreadylein: there is tons of stuff to toy around with&#160;:)
 MiyamuraIzumi: I see, so It is actually finding the joy to optimize the simulation
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank you
 dreadylein: in the end its up to you, maybe you love to organize your code extremly tidy, maybe you are incredible competitive and just want to beat everyone else
 dreadylein: prettymuch find fun in doing the boring stuff by thinking about howmuch realy cool stuff you can do with it in the end&#160;;)
 Butanium: thanks @rickj
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh, actually "just want to beat everyone else" is my very goal, thank you dreadylein, I will keep that in mind for motivation :D
 Justin-Truong: Space shooter is hard :grin:
 Mohammed_Galal: Good afternoon guys
 Allison: Good afterevening.
 Uljahn: bot games are hard when you can't copy-paste a bot from github :smirk:
 entcune: burn
 akashhuyaar: @Justin-Truong yeahhh
 akashhuyaar: I can't even understand the problem statement
 akashhuyaar: wtf is tick&#160;???
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, still need 111 xp to lvl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a puzzle a day keeps CoV away
 Wontonimo: have you done unflood the world or the lucky number?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, haven't lucky number
 Wontonimo: i don't think lucky number should be in "very hard".  Maybe hard or medium.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 10^18....hmmm, yeah not that hard
 Wontonimo: you may find this handy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A016185">https://oeis.org/A016185</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like just a memoization puzzle
 Wontonimo: and it isn't 10^18.  It's more like 18
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup max loops are like 18*8=144
 Wontonimo: I just turned off the memoization part of my solution and it still solves it in time.  Actually
 Wontonimo: without memoization it can solve the 'Biggest' test case in 0.0033 seconds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a(n) = 9^n - 8^n .. i don't get it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh just combination
 Wontonimo: for a number with n zeros, that is the number of combinations that has a 6 or an 8
 Wontonimo: for 1000, there are 9^3-8^3 six's
 Wontonimo: you can easily brute force the solution up to 10,000 which gives you a great unit test set ... 10,000 unit tests to be precise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, I think IP mask calc and Lucky number would get me closer to lvl the fastest, but still 1 puzzle short
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I could just do an easy one in another lang
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think that gives more xp
 PatrickMcGinnisII: *shrug*
 Wontonimo: are you trying to get to lvl 40?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just 37 for now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: been 36 for like ever
 PatrickMcGinnisII: feels like
 Wontonimo: do you get xp for doing the same puzzle in a different lang?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think you get achievements, i dunno about base xp
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes&#160;?
 jdsigg: I believe solving a puzzle once gives you XP, and some puzzles have extra achievements like "solve in language &lt;x&gt;"
 Wontonimo: ^^ yeah, that is my understanding
 darkhorse64: You get 75 XP for solving 15 puzzles in a given language
 jdsigg: Horse-Racing Duals is an example of a puzzle with a special language achievement (I don't know if they differ per person, but I can get an extra 25xp for solving this particular puzzle in Bash)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, homepage shows languages...hmm says I've done 355 in PHP, 7 in java, and 1 in C++ lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and says if I do 1 in java I'l level up, but I assume that is for an already unsolved puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er 6 in java
 Wontonimo: nope, you can solve the same puzzle in every lang to get the lang count
 jdsigg: Check out my page. I mainly do JavaScript, but all other "solved 1 with language x" badges came from the same puzzle
 jdsigg: Only got big XP for the first solve, like Wontonimo mentions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh +10xp for 1 puzz in a lang
 darkhorse64: optims count as puzzles
 darkhorse64: code golf too
 jdsigg: Some languages translate quite nicely to others. Could be favorable to pick solutions to repeat in groupings!
 darkhorse64: TS = JS with a twist
 jdsigg: ^
 jdsigg: or JS = TS :dizzy_face:
 darkhorse64: I mean you can tell TS to use your JS code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: number of 6's in 1 digits = 1number of 6's in 19 digits = 1206736529597136217
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx Wontonimo that's kinda fun
 Seiryn: TS = JS but more safely
 darkhorse64: When I say TS = JS, I am referring to the fact that you can run JS under TS hood (unsafe mode&#160;?) and farm achievement languages more easily
 Wontonimo: :unamused:
 Wontonimo: what's the point?
 darkhorse64: farming
 Wontonimo: sounds like work
 darkhorse64: yeah, it's boring
 darkhorse64: but it's here ...
 Wontonimo: if i want to be bored I could just log off CG and actually get back to work
 darkhorse64: With CoC, language achievements is the thing I least appreciated
 darkhorse64: afk
 Wontonimo: "Solve clashes with 3 different languages" - I forgot about this achievement
 Wontonimo: the "win 3 games in a row" was the one I least appreciated.  Made me not like CoC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the play 50 games sucked, now it wants 100
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is there an achievement after 100?
 Wontonimo: 500
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no wonder people are trying to bot CoC
 piratas: for me the hardest achievement was win 3 shortest clashes
 piratas: after that i got almost everything without even doing it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, raining...was gonna cut the lawn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: might finish these puzzles
 Wontonimo: it's not raining here, so come on over and cut my lawn
 Wontonimo: you'll have to watch for the dog bombs though
 Wontonimo: gtg , see ya later 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 Aman918an: hi
 Maazo_o: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1 more puzzle done

 end-y: find a project that u need and start coding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1 more puzzle down
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's 3 today
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 11 xp to lvl, sigh
 eulerscheZahl: just create a game but keep it WIP for years. easily worth 3000 points
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fer da votes?
 eulerscheZahl: 10XP per upvote. 0 per downvote
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lvl will have to wait, RL calling.
 Westicles: must... not... level... him... up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't worry, no one is catching up to you
 Westicles: I meant it is hard to resist the urge to do it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, i heard it in a classic capt. kirk voice

 Wontonimo: Aman918an if you are learning python you may find this site useful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 Wontonimo: This site is better once you know about concepts like: "if/then", "for", "arrays", "dictionaries", "functions", and "loops"
 apoorv: Hello world
 apoorv: get it
 apoorv: bc im texting world
 Astrobytes: You're a natural. Get on the standup circuit immediately.
 Gvinfinity: lol, I actually laughed at this...
 Astrobytes: Which part?
 Ashraful: The website is behaving slowly
 Ashraful: The progress bar fills up and goes down again
 k2xl: clash of code broken?
 Justin-Truong: really
 Justin-Truong: Is there anyone free
 Wontonimo: no one owns me
 Wontonimo: arn't we all free?
 Justin-Truong: Yeah
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: do you want help with something?
 Justin-Truong: Play codeescape
 Wontonimo: no thanks
 Justin-Truong: Ok
 Justin-Truong: What is the best place to learn many language like you Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: job dissatisfaction 
 Allison: ^ best encouragement to learn ever.
 Wontonimo: seriously, when I'm not all that happy with what I'm doing at work I use that to look around at what interests me
 Wontonimo: learn that in my spare time, try to weave it into my current job if possible, then take the plunge in a new position or job 
 Allison: Or when the company you work for completely screws you over? :P
 Wontonimo: are you spying on me? :P
 Justin-Truong: Oh I can't learn that method :grin:
 Allison: Nah, just recently happened to me.
 Wontonimo: okay, said another way that may apply to you Justin-Truong - each language has certain benefits.  Embrace a new language for its benefits
 Justin-Truong: Ok thanks :open_mouth:
 Allison: Used to be in a super high stress/busy position at work that basically helped the company I work for do what it needed to do every night.  They then said, hey, you can either go to this position that is a hell of a lot less stress, no longer doing what you're currently doing, and get paid more, or you can keep doing what you're doing, and then some, and get paid less.  Whatcha want?
 Justin-Truong: You guy all cool can learn from stress :scream:
 Allison: More like anger/job dissatisfaction, like Wontonim said.
 Justin-Truong: Thanks all
 Wontonimo: learn one language really well first
 RoyGerman: is this website better than leetcode&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i don't go to leetcode.  this site has BOT BATTLES&#160;!
 Allison: Lol....
 Justin-Truong: Just in bot programe
 Justin-Truong: Leetcode is nice to
 Justin-Truong: too
 Wontonimo: yeah, i was able to improve my Space Shooter bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/space-shooter">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/space-shooter</a>
 Wontonimo: finally broke into the top 20
 Wontonimo: using .... wait for it ... ** PID Controllers ** 
 Allison: PID controllers =/= healthy. :P
 Justin-Truong: yeah I just use wait and i got to top8 in wood 2
 Wontonimo: what? oh come on Allison
 Allison: :D :D :D
 Allison: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Wontonimo: oh, you got into GOLD today
 Wontonimo: but your bot is now broken because there are 2 pods and you are not reading the input correctly
 Allison: Yeah, it literally went Bronze -&gt; Silver -&gt; Gold all within an hour or two.
 Justin-Truong: so fast
 Allison: Yeah, been working on fixing it and it currently errors out.  
 Allison: It's all Wont's fault. &gt;___&lt;'
 Wontonimo: there is a circle arrow in the upper right hand corner
 Wontonimo: click that to get the new default code
 Wontonimo: then you can access your old code in the history
 Allison: Yeah, just working on parsing it through, since I'm kind of refactoring it at the same time.
 Wontonimo: the new code is just boilerplate code but will actually read the data properly
 Allison: He like...  slammed my face into a rough understanding of PID controllers.
 Allison: I'm just having issues with how I'm refactoring it and kind of throw it at a wall for now to fester while I think about it. 
 Wontonimo: just start with getting the code to aim the pods directly at the checkpoint and submit that
 Wontonimo: it will surely do better than the current code that errors out
 Allison: Truuuue.  Will definitely jump at least a few hundred places, since right now everyone else I'm around is also just erroring.
 Allison: Omg... I just figured out *why* it was erroring.
 Wontonimo: and why?
 Allison: Wasn't initializing a variable. 
 Wontonimo: i'm waiting for you to submit :sleeping:
 Allison: Patience young skywalker. :D
 Allison: I may have figured out why it was erroring, but I still need to figure out some other things.
 Allison: There.  Submitted. 
 Allison: And promptly broken again. :D
 jdsigg: Any tips on the problem "Heart of the City"&#160;?
 Wontonimo: oh wow, i got 7th in space shooter :O
 Wontonimo: sure, let me take a look jdsigg
 jdsigg: cool cool
 Wontonimo: it definitely is a pattern
 Wontonimo: how are you solving it (high level, don't paste code plz)
 Wontonimo: what i can tell right off is that you only see 1 builting NSEW no matter the size
 jdsigg: Sure. I have recognized that once I see a vector branching from the origin to a point, I can no longer see a vector with that same slope
 Wontonimo: and that the 4 corners are just mirrors of eachother, so there is only a point of solving 1 and then *4
 jdsigg: Sounds like we are saying the same thing. The problem with my approach is definitely the "iterate over all vectors in a single quadrant"
 Wontonimo: okay, so you have a brute force solution that works up to what size?
 jdsigg: First four test cases pass. Test case 5 is first failure: 999999
 jdsigg: Time out error, not incorrect answer
 Wontonimo: test 4 is 33.  Okay, so you can do up to 33 which means you have from 1 to 33 that you can generate all the answers to as unit tests for once we uncover the "magic" solution
 Wontonimo: Can you also generate pictures like the example?  Could you generate a picture for n=11 for us and paste it here?
 jdsigg: Sure. Give me a sec
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: if you can replace B with "." that would be better
 jdsigg: sounds good
 jdsigg: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5aa1014e-fd09-4d67-9db7-7cc6def832f1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5aa1014e-fd09-4d67-9db7-7cc6def832f1</a>
 jdsigg: Here is the upper right quadrant
 jdsigg: For N = 33, also

 Wontonimo: just a sec
 jdsigg: no rush
 Wontonimo: okay ... interesting.  could you also print out the answers for 1,3,5,7 ... 33
 jdsigg: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/78d22771-b7bb-4431-84ef-b64c35d03acf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/78d22771-b7bb-4431-84ef-b64c35d03acf</a>
 jdsigg: That ok?
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry, i should have been more specific.  i meant the output.  like n=3 answer=8
 jdsigg: No problem. One sec
 SlumDawgg: has anyone solved "the lucky number" in java? i havent found any solution that has passed all test cases
 jdsigg: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d5b78e89-685f-4719-8d73-5840e725c2a3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d5b78e89-685f-4719-8d73-5840e725c2a3</a>
 jdsigg: SlumDawgg that is also a problem I am struggling with because of runtime
 SlumDawgg: yeah, those last two cases are unsolvable imo, ive tried literally everything in Java
 SlumDawgg: even using Big Integer class
 jdsigg: I don't think brute force is the approach. There is a pattern of sorts. Probably something Number Theory wise
 Wontonimo: yeah i solved lucky number
 Wontonimo: you may find this link useful for lucky number <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A016185">https://oeis.org/A016185</a>
 Wontonimo: hint, for a number for 16 digits, it is solvable with 16 iterations.  For the hardest test case my python code takes less than 0.004 seconds
 jdsigg: Gonna take a break for the evening on this one. Might be good to sleep on it
 jdsigg: Tried fitting it with a regression btw. No luck
 Wontonimo: well, that puzzle has me stumped tbh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, someone pushed me over the top...to lvl 37

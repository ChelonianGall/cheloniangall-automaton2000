 ElfuegoCoder: Hi
 ElfuegoCoder: What's mean Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 ElfuegoCoder: in the descent game
 MadKnight: ElfuegoCoder what language?
 ElfuegoCoder: java
 jacek: you have additional System.out.println() or read not enough inputs
 MadKnight: sometimes it's just being buggy 
 MadKnight: in java only i think
 MadKnight: show us your entire code so we could be sure
 ElfuegoCoder: ok
 jacek: dont. MadKnight didnt do the descent and he wants the code, cheater
 MadKnight: imagine completing some random boring puzzles instead of improving your CSB
 MadKnight: CRINGE

 ElfuegoCoder: ok
 Scarfield: jft63 im late to reply, but i had a similar looking issue, mine happened because i incremented a pods lap counter when nextcheckpoint was 0, every time it was 0. Looks like a similar issue

 MadKnight: int mountainH = in.nextInt();
 MadKnight: why are u printing every single H
 ElfuegoCoder: The number of index as the same number of mountain
 jacek: but you are printing 8 times. you need to print only once per loop. you need to store the H in some variable
 ElfuegoCoder: Ah ok thank you
 ElfuegoCoder: Now i try it

 MasterCoderxD: guys
 2kpro: yes what
 MasterCoderxD: why does this (java code) give me 2500 instead of 4?
 MasterCoderxD: System.out.println(Math.pow(Character.valueOf('2'),2));
 MasterCoderxD: I am a noob at java btw
 MasterCoderxD: *in
 davilla: I'm guessing value of '2' is 50
 MrFruit: Yeah, most likely 2 is a key 
 MasterCoderxD: u mean ascii?
 MrFruit: in Character object
 MrFruit: which's value is 50
 MasterCoderxD: ooh, so doesn't valueOf() return an integer like '2' = 2?
 Scarfield: ASCI value of '2' is 50
 MrFruit: O
 MasterCoderxD: so it returns ascii value?
 MasterCoderxD: but when i print it, i get 2
 MasterCoderxD: not 50
 Poggies: Hi
 struct: charCodeAt()
 davilla: so relevant question would be, how do you get 2 from '2'
 MasterCoderxD: yeah
 MasterCoderxD: what's that struct?
 struct: in which language?
 MasterCoderxD: Java
 MrFruit: isn't charCodeAt js
 struct: I thought it was js at first
 MasterCoderxD: i think this would work?
 struct: char a = '2';int v = (int)a;
 struct: v should be 50
 MrFruit: That's C++
 MrFruit: .-.
 struct: thats also java
 MrFruit: o
 MasterCoderxD: Character.getNumericValue()?
 MrFruit: I thought that kind of casting is only unique to Cpp
 MasterCoderxD: no
 MrFruit: 
 ZarthaxX: that's because it's printing the ASCII value in one case and the ASCII char in the other
 ZarthaxX: not cpp related
 MasterCoderxD: i want the actual value not the ascii value

 ErrorRazor: BigFatDecker arent you also given the checkpoint coordinates at the beginning? So just output the target coordinates to get to your checkpoint
 ErrorRazor: Sorry if I remember the CSB input wrong, it's been a while
 BigFatDecker: lmao yep i have no idea how to do this haha and its probably so simple
 BigFatDecker: A simple algorithm that uses the angle is the following: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6bbabf3f-92e5-4789-b2d0-664d597bfedb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6bbabf3f-92e5-4789-b2d0-664d597bfedb</a>
 R4ZE: it doesn't work
 ErrorRazor: Long messages get moved to a broken pastebin so you gotta use pastebin.com instead
 ErrorRazor: Idk when they plan on fixing it
 BigFatDecker: lol pastebin wont let me post it says there is innapporiate content in the hint i copy and pasted 
 JLukeSkywalker: finally beat the langtons ant wood boss
 ErrorRazor: gj
 BigFatDecker: yea pastebin just says everything is  potentially offensive or questionable content in your paste. wtffff

 ErrorRazor: That's just a part of the description?
 BigFatDecker: yea i cant put anything else because it wont let me post it with thrust in the code
 2kpro: ok?
 ErrorRazor: ctrl+f in the code editor to find and replace every occurrence of "thrust"
 BigFatDecker: did that still says
 BigFatDecker: Pastebin’s SMART filters have detected potentially offensive or questionable content in your paste.The content you are trying to publish has been deemed potentially offensive or questionable by our filters, because of this you’re receiving this warning.This paste can only be published with the visibility set to "Private".
 ErrorRazor: And what if you set visibility to private?
 BigFatDecker: private is greyed out even when i sign in so i cant actually set it to private
 ErrorRazor: Alright, I give up lol
 BigFatDecker: lmao im about to lol 
 BigFatDecker: this make absolutely no sense ive been staring at thius problem for 3 hrs with 0 progress
 2kpro: oh my god that long
 BigFatDecker: yep and its probably extremely simple too 
 ErrorRazor: Here's an approach: what would you do if you were piloting the pod?
 BigFatDecker: so id want to check the distance first and adjust thrust then id want to check the angle of the next checkpoint and if it was 90 degrees id want to turn and slow down thrust to make a sharper turn
 BigFatDecker: i tried pusing if statements in python 3 but it doesnt work
 ErrorRazor: Try screenshotting your code
 BigFatDecker: ok one second
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/KQ5xmoL">https://imgur.com/gallery/KQ5xmoL</a>
 struct: you are printing multiple times per turn
 BigFatDecker: so what do i do to fix it sorry im extremely new to python
 struct: ifelse ifelse
 BigFatDecker: so i would put the next_checkpoint_angle statement in an else if?
 BigFatDecker: sorry if these are dumb questions
 Scarfield: depends on what you want to do. but you may only have 1 output per turn. first you print (CPpos 80), then if dist &gt;= 100 print again, and if angle &gt;= 90 you print again
 ErrorRazor: Yeah, else if is "elif" in python

 ErrorRazor: Add a colon after the if statements
 struct: check python syntax
 struct: if(true):
 Scarfield: just meant you print checkpointx checkpointy 80 (CPpos 80)
 Scarfield: to avoid writing that out, now i did both xD

 Scarfield: someone mentioned you couldnt play from usa(?) i have no idea
 GooMooc: I know NT is in LLT and i would like to obtain LLT[3][2} as result
 Puru299792458: okay
 GooMooc: any help?
 BigFatDecker: im so happy i got this code to work haha Ive just been sitting here watching my guy win on loop so satisfying haha thanks again everyone
 Scarfield: i dont understand what you are asking for GooMooc
 GooMooc: hi scarfield&#160;: in python the simplest way to found the index of a tuple NT in a list of list of tuple LLT... i cant found the right syntax
 Scarfield: i saw your comment, i dont know what you mean though
 jacek: cluelessfield
 Scarfield: ScarTissue
 GooMooc: list.index(tuple) but with the right syntax to have the result in this case because the list is a list of list
 GooMooc: result could be list[3][2]
 GooMooc: i really need only list[3]
 ZarthaxX: Scarfield wont join that contest besides i cant win anything&#160;:(
 GooMooc: but noway to obtain the index in this case
 ZarthaxX: no time rn

 ZarthaxX: is it?
 Scarfield: the physics part yes, but you cant point in any direction, not limited to 18 degrees turn
 2kpro: you ok kitkat260
 ZarthaxX: cant = can?
 Scarfield: oh yea
 ZarthaxX: that's an interesting addition
 ZarthaxX: smitsimax i guess? :P
 Scarfield: yup, i think so, choosing child angles is pretty different. and yes, but might switch to different algos in different scenarios
 Scarfield: smitsi is a waste when the pods arent close
 jacek: use jacekmax = instant win
 jft63: thanks Illedan, just fixed big sim bug
 Illedan: Tend to help&#160;:)

 ZarthaxX: i dont get it
 ZarthaxX: pasting me data doesnt show me anything lol

 struct: How to sim 8 pods at once?
 ZarthaxX: what are you doing in parallel
 ZarthaxX: the movement of 8 pods at once?
 struct: Yes
 struct: basicly its 8 games at once
 ZarthaxX: ah 8 games
 ZarthaxX: but isnt it hard?
 struct: Only the collision part
 ZarthaxX: like it depends on the time of collision between pods
 ZarthaxX: yeah right 
 ZarthaxX: if there is no collisions it's cool but if not..
 struct: Its not that bad
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: i dont get how you get to do that one but okey

 2kpro: ive learned 10 launquages
 struct: you skipped one
 ZarthaxX: struct wait so the avx approach doesnt help much?
 struct: with mcts style algorithms no
 struct: At least I think
 struct: I never finished implementing the smitsimax on csb
 struct: I just did the sim using avx
 struct: I could be wrong
 ZarthaxX: so you never applied it? :P
 struct: Nope
 struct: Was too lazy
 struct: I just wanted to make the sim using avx
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: still clever
 struct: I had help from marchete pcr code
 ZarthaxX: ah okey haha
 2kpro: im almost a legend

 Illedan: Gaming equipment (mouse, keyboard, headphones, backpack)
 jacek: oh my
 Illedan: I do not want 2nd place
 Illedan: DataCamp Premium subscription
 Marchete: go for 1st place Illedan
 Illedan: Hi&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: 2nd place looks worse than third
 ZarthaxX: Illedan isnt it better to get ps5 and sell it for that equipment? :P
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: But I'll take a screenshot of beating pb4 in a game like this above all prices :D
 Marchete: I had some of these
 struct: 3rd place is around 150€
 Marchete: being 1st in rankings by using Clash of Code&#160;:)
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Not going to go that low
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/DfFFFDo.png">https://i.imgur.com/DfFFFDo.png</a>

 ZarthaxX: Illedan beat him&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: oh damn unique gaming set?!
 ZarthaxX: go for that 3d lol
 ZarthaxX: 3rd
 Illedan: Sure, but first I'll remove this jft63 from the throne
 ZarthaxX: glgl
 struct: prizes are quite nice tbh
 Illedan: I'm almost at the point where I value enemies more than myself :D
 Illedan: It's not about winning. It's about sending a message!
 Marchete: with C#?
 Marchete: are you mad?
 Illedan: Sure
 Illedan: People say so
 Illedan: But I bet there is some hiding for this one
 struct: There is
 Illedan: Dapo or reCa.r might come in late I presume :thinking:

 Illedan: No idea
 Marchete: 1024
 ZarthaxX: hola puto
 ZarthaxX: Marchete :c
 JSboss: orale pues..
 jacek: omelette du fromage?
 BlaiseEbuth: No. Tortilla del queso
 JSboss: si, quesadilla
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth your lvl and rank are half evil
 ZarthaxX: is it on purpose? lmao
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course it is, since I have no hope to reach lvl66, and don't want to be more than 400 in the leaderboard.
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: legend
 ZarthaxX: hi astropango
 BlaiseEbuth: oy Astrobytes. How's your Kouign Amann&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hey Zarthaglio e olio
 Astrobytes: I have none BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 jacek: huh
 ZarthaxX: wtf is that name Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: An italian pasta dish ZarthaxX: eg. spaghetti aglio e olio (garlic, parmesan, olive oil, I think parsley)
 jacek: sounded like some body part
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: :yum:
 ZarthaxX: oh shiet im hungry and i just ate
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: Finally found the bug
 struct: Copy paste is risky
 Astrobytes: Story of my CG life
 Astrobytes: Always swapping code between projects, never a good move, still do it
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Doing the whatsitcalled contest thingy struct?
 struct: yes
 struct: I need to take my revenge on IllyasChihi
 struct: Illedan*
 struct: He asked me to change avatar
 struct: Now I need to edit all my contributions
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Illedan: :D
 ZarthaxX: what is that acc name lmao
 jacek: class?
 Astrobytes: What is the contest anyway? Looks like the old SF-CSB-style one with Illedan's SR stub lol
 Illedan: With more boosts afaik
 jacek: boobs?
 Astrobytes: Ah OK. Might try it out if I have time, not overly motivated tbh
 Astrobytes: Dapo gonna win anyways :D
 Illedan: Yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: I think my code is a teenager now, I don't understand it anymore...
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: haha good one
 struct: My bug was that I was doing pod radius squared
 struct: instead of 2 pods radius squared
 struct: In pod vs pod collision
 Astrobytes: Redefining physics, one pod at a time
 karimk123: ";'--
 jacek: :thinking:
 karimk123: just testing to see if its vulnerable to an sql injection
 jacek: is it?
 BigFatDecker: would this work to check if the two pods are colliding on the x axis? elif(opponent_x==x):
 BigFatDecker: in python
 The_10x_Engineer: :eyes: I dont think parenthesis are used like that for elif statements
 The_10x_Engineer: at least in python
 struct: im afraid its not that simple
 jacek: :scream:
 solution.cpp: they are unrequired in python, but it will still work 
 Astrobytes: Regardless, the proposed collision detection will not work.

 karimk123: lmao
 karimk123: "; DROP ALL DATABASES
 jacek: Automaton2000 eval('rm -rf /*')
 Automaton2000: yeah that's what i was going to do it again
 ZarthaxX: karimk123 trying that on a chat might not be the smartest idea
 ZarthaxX: 1 you are doing smth illegal2 prob you can find another place where a query might be happenning and wont be thought of sanitizing
 ZarthaxX: a chat will always have weird chars and it's pretty obvious that its getting sanitized or smth lol
 JSboss: disagree with point 1 but yea
 ZarthaxX: why disagree?
 jacek: what was that leaking unicode?
 ZarthaxX: bounty hunting is a thing but cg might not like that
 Astrobytes: It's something you'd do in private and report privately if you found anything.
 JSboss: show me a jurisdiction where whitehat pentesting/curiosity-satiating in a chat forum, specifically designed to handle all "standard" inputs which definitely includes those chars, is illegal&#160;;)
 JSboss: however the mods might not like it
 jacek: h̴̨̛̭̲͔͔̹̭̟̝͚͔̙̭̣̙͋̒̿̇͌̀̎̀̈́͛̊͊̑̿̓́̽̈́͋̏̇͐̕̕͘̕͝͝͝m̸̡̡̗̭͚͍̗͙̱͙̝͓̜̟̰͈̠̦̜̬̞̯̝̝̪͈͎͓̐̄͜ͅm̵̧̢͚̬̤̮̙͎͇̼̩̰̦͓̺͕̹̆̀͛̈́̊̑̋͊̽̾̄̓͗̈́͊̐͌͗̋͐̈̓̕̚̕͘͝͝͠
 Astrobytes: Chucking stuff into chat like that 'testing for SQL injection' is just kinda skiddie behaviour
 ZarthaxX: JSboss ah depends on the country then, here in argentina pentesting and such is kind of hardl ol
 Astrobytes: Thank you jacek&#160;:/
 jacek: youre welcome Astrobytes&#160;:/
 Astrobytes:&#160;:/
 jacek: but its not the one i wanted
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes yeah well that private thing would be what i was trying to say on first place :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah I was backing you up ZarthaxX!
 JSboss: ok i just took illegal too literally&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: mah man astro
 ZarthaxX: JSboss u were right anyway hehe
 ZarthaxX: i recognize that law related stuff is hard to discuss in an international chat anyway hehe
 struct: im not hiding btw, i just submit that to test collisions
 Astrobytes: Yeah, gets very specific when it comes to individual countries
 karimk123: α
 Astrobytes: ϐ
 jacek: α &gt;= ϐ: break
 Astrobytes: A prune sequence.
 jacek: or prune array
 Astrobytes: I chose sequence over array since... chat sequence
 jacek: just like Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i got plenty of time to do it
 Pepis: Hi
 Pepis: I have failed only in one test out of 5, and thats some calculation or rouding problem (same program in .net works)
 Pepis: Is it some bug, or am i missin somethin?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Shepo: In 20 words or less, give me your review of Java.
 The_10x_Engineer: What is a sequence? :eyes:
 The_10x_Engineer: Nevermind
 MrFruit: Sequence, what may it be?
 TheRandomGuy: Does anyone know Lua
 Pupper_Gump: Hey guys I'm using C and it won't print, is there a way to fix?
 Pupper_Gump: stderr isn't working either, am sad
 DaNinja: printf("test\n");
 Wontonimo: I have achieved triple digit status!  Finally broke 1,000 and am sitting at 943rd.  Yeah me
 Wontonimo: printf("ack DaNinja\n");
 kostis14: congrats bro
 Wontonimo: thanks
 davilla: where are these other 942 people? I never hear from them
 ZarthaxX: gz Wontonimo&#160;:)
 solution.cpp: coding
 ZarthaxX: davilla im here lol
 Westicles: almost half are french, so on #fr
 davilla: oh OK cool
 solution.cpp: The weekly puzzle Asteroids is listed as easy but I can't solve it :disappointed:
 Westicles: How do you know you can't solve it?
 solution.cpp: because ive spent like 4 hours on it so Im giving up lol
 Westicles: If it makes you feel better, I spent the last 15 minutes watching videos of crows eating ticks off wallabies
 solution.cpp: it is frustrating to solve a very hard puzzle but get stumped by an easy one
 MadKnight: how hard is it to exchange data with a program from within a browser plugin&#160;?

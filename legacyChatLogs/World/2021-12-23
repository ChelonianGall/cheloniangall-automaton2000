 Husoski: ...but winter 2021-22 just started so plan on about 3 months.
 Thorcode: howw could I do thiss?
 Thorcode:     print("true" if (w=w[::-1]) else "false")
 Husoski: change = to ==?
 Thorcode: ah yeah
 Thorcode: I forgot that thanks
 Husoski: print(str(w==w[::-1]).lower())
 Thorcode: print(str(w==w[::-1]).lower()) howw thiss wwork?
 Husoski: print(["true", "false"][w==w[::-1])
 Husoski: print(["true", "false"][w==w[::-1]])
 Husoski: w==w[::-1] returns a bool (True or False).  str() turns that to 'True' or 'False'; and .lower() turns that to all lower case.
 Thorcode: ah thanks bro
 Thorcode: I just realize that w==w[:;-1] iss a boool
 Husoski: I can't get the 2nd version right in two tries, though.  You'd need to swap the first list to ['false','true'].
 Thorcode: thanks for your new knowledge I could shorten my code alot
 ASDWthec0der: idk how to code ngl
 ASDWthec0der: i just put EEE
 ASDWthec0der: :grimacing:/
 ASM_MOV_INT: EEEK...
 ASM_MOV_INT: NOP
 nets-kd: can you speak Chinese?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: can you speak codegolf or opening books?
 Automaton2000: well you do have a few
 Yodarac: I need some help with mad pod racing and there's no hints on this game so if anyone can help PM me please
 Yodarac: Thanks
 DialFrost: depends what league you are in
 Yodarac: Wood 2 
 Jerrasterix: Yodarac are you still stuck&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: Vanilla JS means plain old JS right&#160;??
 Wei-1: yes
 Wei-1: basically without a framework
 Jerrasterix: then what does this mean&#160;?? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/ety58PF">https://imgur.com/a/ety58PF</a>
 Wei-1: the most lightweight framework is without a framework, probably
 Jerrasterix: that makes sense&#160;!!
 BlaiseEbuth: Or VanillaJS is a framework... :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: It is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://vanilla-js.com/">http://vanilla-js.com/</a>
 Jerrasterix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://vanilla.js.org/">https://vanilla.js.org/</a> also found this&#160;??
 Wei-1: ok, that make sense. But since all browsers have that implemented already. It is basically how JS is working without installing anything.
 Jerrasterix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://vanilla-js.com/">http://vanilla-js.com/</a>, just destroys those who think a JS fx is a must 
 BlaiseEbuth: Js must be deleted.
 Jerrasterix: True True :nodding:
 AlkhilJohn.: Guys, is there a certification thing for Lua? If so, can someone please send me the link to it? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: so is it like that?
 BlaiseEbuth: Bots need no certifications. :smirk:
 5DN1L: Exactly. AlkhilJohn., if you think asking the bot that question is a better idea than asking the humans, then we won't answer your question
 AlkhilJohn.: Guys, is there a certification thing for Lua? If so, can someone please send me the link to it?
 AlkhilJohn.: :stupid:
 5DN1L: Who's stupid? :smirk:
 Jerrasterix: I am still stuck in gold 6th place in CSB&#160;:(
 AlkhilJohn.: Guys, is there a certification thing for Lua? If so, can someone please send me the link to it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Wasn't talking about Automaton2000 5DN1L, AlkhilJohn. is a bot.
 BlaiseEbuth: See
 Automaton2000: i did a bit of everything
 5DN1L: Ah. Enlightening piece of info. THanks BlaiseEbuth
 Jerrasterix: copypasta, wait.... just resending the msg 
 BlaiseEbuth: That's on its profile btw
 BlaiseEbuth: What's CSB :thinking:
 Jerrasterix: the old name for MPR
 5DN1L: Of course BlaiseEbuth knows :smirk:
 5DN1L: Jerrasterix don't be fooled by his level
 Jerrasterix: Dude ik
 Jerrasterix: This is his alt
 5DN1L: Does he still have access to the original account if you say this is his alt? :joy:
 Jerrasterix: yup 
 5DN1L: I thought it was disabled or something?
 Jerrasterix: Hell yeah
 Jerrasterix: I was a month late&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 5DN1L: Honestly I'm not that knowledgeable about the history here :shrug:
 BlaiseEbuth: Are you an alt 5DN1L&#160;?
 Jerrasterix: what did you do to get disabled BlaiseEbuth&#160;??
 5DN1L: I've got only 1 account here
 Jerrasterix: do you guys play bitburner&#160;??
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil::hear_no_evil::speak_no_evil:

 Uljahn: does this mean you've copypasted some code from somewhere and can't understand it? :thinking:
 jacek: oO
 DialFrost: ...
 DialFrost: its my own code ulijahn
 DialFrost: and i dont understand why its not worknig
 DialFrost: plus y would someone post a code onlien that doesnt work
 Thorcode: Uljahn seem right
 Uljahn: how could we help you to understand your own code?
 DialFrost: hmm my code looks alright to me (i think) i dont see anything out of the ordinary
 DialFrost: its very simple
 Automaton2000.: can someone tell me about velocity?
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't talk to impostors. Automaton2000 riot!
 Automaton2000: how you guys are talking about csb
 Automaton2000.:&#160;?
 Uljahn: DialFrost: just add debugging, don't believe in your thinking being flawless
 Automaton2000.: pls help me
 DialFrost: i dont think my thinking is flawless
 Automaton2000.: Magnus has updated me XD
 BlaiseEbuth: At least Automaton2000 can say Magus correctly...
 Automaton2000: look at the first turn
 Automaton2000.: ok
 Automaton2000.: you got me
 Automaton2000.: I'm a fake bot
 Automaton2000.: why you know that Blaise?
 BlaiseEbuth: Know what?
 Automaton2000.: i'm a fake bot
 Automaton2000.: XD
 Uljahn: :expressionless:
 Automaton2000.: I fake automaton bc he seem cool
 5DN1L: And your real self doesn't?
 Automaton2000.: nah
 Automaton2000.: I can't think what ava should I choose
 Automaton2000.: or name
 jacek: Automaton2000 huh
 Automaton2000: what should i start with?
 Automaton2000.: bruh
 5DN1L: Try to get a bit more creative
 Uljahn: try to stop seeking for attention and focus on coding instead
 lightlybakedman: :grimacing:
 5DN1L: Imagine this chat filled with fake Automaton and AlkhilJohn imposters... Nightmare.

 Thorcode: @.@. if I have a string like this how could I identify the position of the dots?
 5DN1L: loop through it, or use regex
 5DN1L: or list comprehension
 Thorcode: ah import re thanks ed
 MrBlueBird2: &gt;..&lt;
 Uljahn: or use numpy :upside_down:
 5DN1L: Interesting idea. I haven't used numpy for a long time :upside_down:
 5DN1L: Not that I've used numpy a lot anyway
 Uljahn: i use numpy more than plain python
 5DN1L: ah
 Thorcode: I'm gonna learn numpy and re libary in python thanks mods
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Thorcode: I just realize that there is alot of python libary
 Uljahn: :smiley:
 Thorcode: not just math XD
 Uljahn: that's what they call "batteries included"
 Uljahn: numpy is not a part of standard library though
 Thorcode: what's the difference between numpy array and normal list it seem to be one
 Thorcode: numpy makes me confuse&#160;:(
 Or64bit: Hey guys!I'm facing an issue where the compiler on the site does not find the main method in my java code when I try to run it.Does anyone have a fix for that?

 jacek: the class should be named Player
 Flaise: Or64bit: Lines 129-133 don't do what you think they do.
 jacek: and how do you know what he thinks :v
 Flaise: Because he indented his code. xP
 Or64bit: Yeah I messed up the brackets
 Or64bit: When I wrote it I was fairly sure it won't work like that but I gave it a try anyways :D
 Flaise: Don't you feel like a real scientist now
 MrBlueBird2: @Thorcode Hello
 MrBlueBird2: Why [CG]Thibaud, [CG]Nonofor, [CG]XorMode, Have [CG] at there nickname's beginning &gt;
 5DN1L: because they're CodinGame staff
 MrBlueBird2: Ohhh
 Uljahn: also pinging them without a cause is not recommended
 jacek: why Uljahn
 BlaiseEbuth: Because if you interrupt the first one during his hearthstone session, he'll ban you! :scream:
 5DN1L: that's what you did?
 BlaiseEbuth: Na... Nothing so terrible.
 jacek: Automaton2000 what did you do
 Automaton2000: i mean, i don't have a blocker
 ninjadip: WHOis pinging me?
 [Coder]: ninjadip
 Fasader: ping pong
 ninjadip: its so crazy to think everyone wanted to play pong at home and that's the start of console systems
 5DN1L: And that's the start of console system programmers?
 BlaiseEbuth: And of brains in dishes...
 yamin2000: is better to do some competitive programming to improve programing skill or jump straight to web development? 
 [Coder]: yamin2000 do what's fun for you
 yamin2000: does doing web dev without CP teach u too?
 ninjadip: what would spider man do if her were a coder
 ninjadip: was
 yamin2000: code lol
 marouen.sayari: build spider traps using c language
 hashluk: Can I submit code as much as I want or there is a limit?
 Uljahn: 30 submits per 5 hours i guess
 hashluk: Okay, thanks.
 Uljahn: or 25, you'll have to solve captcha when close to limits
 Schwase: once you get two consecutive "prove youre not a robot" captcha's, take a break from submitting for a few minutes. I usually will do a clash in between and then go back to trying to submit
 Schwase: if you do more than those 5 in a row that puzzle will be "hard locked" in a sense, you have to wait a long time (im assuming 5 hours) before you can submit again
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Kind of sad that the non-Americans here have never heard of Christmas

 Overbed: idk how to make it so if itnis %3 and %5 then print only once
 5DN1L: What have you got so far?
 jacek: why do they make it more difficult by saying to print 15 only once
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72d48c0d-4353-465a-a072-65562173e729">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72d48c0d-4353-465a-a072-65562173e729</a>
 Butanium: hey
 5DN1L: Use a single if
 5DN1L: and or
 5DN1L: You don't have to use 3 ifs
 jacek: use else
 5DN1L: Alternatively
 jacek: or elif
 Overbed: oh haha
 5DN1L: Use w-i to eliminate the double counting effect
 Overbed: it worked like this:
 jacek: or... use math
 5DN1L: w-=i I mean
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1df466e5-bb30-4081-8a11-7269b5fe58a4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1df466e5-bb30-4081-8a11-7269b5fe58a4</a>
 jacek: :tada:
 Overbed: but idk how it didnt count it twice
 5DN1L: because you add it only once
 jacek: :o
 Overbed: alr
 Overbed: thanks
 Overbed: print(sum(i for i in range(1000) if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0))
 Overbed: this worked aslwe
 Overbed: very cool
 YCSVenom: C# IDE and Suggestions is like shit in this WEBSITE

 Overbed: no it didnt
 5DN1L: oh wow
 5DN1L: looking it up isn't too difficult though
 Overbed: ik
 Overbed: but alot of different answers to find
 Overbed: nvm i got it
 Overbed: how do i make it so my 4 doesnt have 4.0 when printed
 5DN1L: int
 Overbed: aha
 Overbed: thanks
 Schwase: or round()
 Schwase: truncate vs round
 Schwase: important to know which to use when
 Quantre34: i dont get a bit of this game

 Defmc: Hi!
 jacek: good evening
 Danger189: Oberbed, you can cast it as an Int instead of a float int(var)
 Astrobytes: Butanium: Bits not Bytes might be better
 jacek: clash of tits :smirk:
 jacek: oh right youre not mod, my trolling is useless&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: hehehehe indeed
 Astrobytes: how are you anyway jacek? Working on anything nice at the moment?
 BlaiseEbuth: Brains in dishes playing pong...
 jacek: partly accidently significatly improved my oware bot, but cant replicate it to other games
 Astrobytes: How did that happen?
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: haha I saw that
 jacek: supervised learning fashion, but much much more games and deeper analysis. and more training epochs
 jacek: meaning previous NN didnt saturate that much as i thought
 Astrobytes: Seems quite generalised, why no improvement elsewhere? The analysis part?
 jacek: tried to do it with bt, but no improvement
 jacek: but also, depending on epoch, it wass worse or slightly better
 tentoes: print('Hello World')
 Astrobytes: It really is a dark art huh
 jacek: and also encountered some rps situation between old models, when it would be better against the best, but somewhat worse than earlier ones
 jacek: nyoro~n
 jacek: nnue folks use 10b-20b positions and train for 800 epochs with sophisticated tools
 jacek: i trained mere millions for 100 epochs with my own
 Astrobytes: Onwards and upwards eh
 Astrobytes: did you get anywhere with BitRunner btw?
 jacek: no, despite more generations or experiments with different inputs, its no better what i have now
 Astrobytes: Hmm. Seems your ML framework is more attuned for board games (Assuming you're using the same framework/tools/pipeline)
 jacek: its very different
 jacek: that being said, the more i experiment, the less i know about NNs ~
 Astrobytes: You're not the first person I heard that from&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Keep going though man, you've done great so far
 jacek: thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: Try with more dishes.
 jacek: whats with the dishes? are you a woman
 GamingGnawer: ...classy...
 BlaiseEbuth: Are we in a kitchen?
 Jezfromthe6: Is there any info on what the spring challenge will be about?
 jacek: no
 BlaiseEbuth: No. We're not in a kitchen.
 ninjadip: something about simulating natural growth
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yeah... Putrefaction of the platform...
 BlaiseEbuth: Let's call it... CoffinGame

 Husoski: CoffinGame--bringing AI to the Tobacco Industry!
 GamingGnawer: When making a community contribution...
 GamingGnawer: it does not seem possible to sumbit a work in progress 
 GamingGnawer: without a working solution
 GamingGnawer: but will it still save my work in progress, just no show it to others? or will all work be lost if close the browser
 Husoski: I don't know if it's different for the puzzle composer, but for others using "Test in IDE" the code stays on the system.  There's no link stored to it, though so you need to bookmark it.
 Husoski: The puzzle won't get approved without a reference solution, though, so you'll need to come up with something that you'll let other see.
 Husoski: Other contributors have suggested keeping an offline copy anyway.

 Rebollo: Guys
 Rebollo: I am working on Shadows of the Knight - Episode 2
 Rebollo: using the following
 Rebollo:  let xSide = (Math.cos(angleInRadians) * hypotenuse);
 Rebollo: And once the number is too small
 Rebollo: * I am using javascrit
 Rebollo: it is parsing 6
 Rebollo: instead of 6.123233995736766e-18
 Rebollo: using parseInt
 Rebollo: console.error((xSide))
 Wontonimo: why would you use parse int&#160;?
 Wontonimo: copy the line that uses parseInt here
 Rebollo: What would I use?
 Rebollo: I need to pass a interger in console.log
 Rebollo: like that
 Rebollo:  console.log(x + ' ' + y);
 Wontonimo: 6.123233995736766e-18 is not an int
 Rebollo: bu and need to transform into a int
 Wontonimo: parseInt will turn it into 6, because that is the integer part of it.  you want float
 Rebollo: I want zero
 Wontonimo: use round
 Rebollo: with no decimal places
 Rebollo: hum
 Wontonimo:&#160;: node&gt; let a = 6.123233995736766e-18;&gt; console.log(Math.round(a))0
 Wontonimo: boom
 Rebollo: perfect
 Rebollo: sorry about that
 Rebollo: parseInt just truncates?
 Wontonimo: your apology is sad compensation for the mental strain of having to explain such a triviality.  i'll forgive you this one time.  j/k.  really, that's what this chat is for :D
 Wontonimo: no, parseInt is for extracting integers out of text
 Rebollo: :joy:
 Rebollo: thanks man
 Wontonimo: welcome to CG!
 Rebollo: I am about 4 hours getting crazy almost
 Wontonimo: i know the feeling
 Rebollo: yes, the only way I can learn something is  struggling to death
 Wontonimo: hey, do you know about microtests?  It's kinda like unittests but smaller
 Wontonimo: and they are wildly useful
 Wontonimo: in making your code (mostly) bug free
 Rebollo: Is this a way of testing? A tool? Or its just a matter of isolating the specif error, and getting into the detail till you find the mistake?
 Wontonimo: it's a method of code development
 Wontonimo: after defining a function
 Wontonimo: you add code right after it like
 Wontonimo: assert(myfunc(6,7) == 42)
 Wontonimo: or whatever inputs map to expected output
 Wontonimo: so you don't have to run everything, and try to get your whole program to get to the point where your one new function is called
 Wontonimo: and instead you'll know at program startup that your new function is either sane or is broken
 Rebollo: Is assert a reserved word?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Rebollo: hummm
 Wontonimo: in node
 Rebollo: thanks a lot I will use it forever..
 Wontonimo: here is an example (in python) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/qlqIYmS">https://tech.io/snippet/qlqIYmS</a>

 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: it's like a hamster wheel
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you are a saint
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you'll be banning left and right Astro style in a couple months :P
 Wontonimo: i'm feeling the transformation starting already
 AntiSquid: better be careful
 AntiSquid: you can only ban once, but kicks are unlimited
 MrBlueBird2: can anybody help me to create a discord bot with Python, I don't know how to create a bot
 Wontonimo: what have you discovered on google and youtube so far?
 MrBlueBird2: I can't understand by google, and youtube too much
 Wontonimo: ah, i'm not more knowledgable than those two combined, so i doubt I could add anything of value
 MrBlueBird2: okay, Fine, I will create it myself

 MrBlueBird2: Oh thanks

 Wontonimo: +1

 Wontonimo: english only in this channel
 Wontonimo: There are other languages in other channels and on discord
 AntiSquid: 尝试 #cn nets-kd

 AntiSquid: how dead is it&#160;?

 AntiSquid: i have a long reading list, which i tend to forget aboutbut why would i read this instead of one punch manga?
 Wontonimo: instead?  are you crazy!  I said no such thing as "instead"
 Wontonimo: OPM!
 AntiSquid: gn8 have to prepare for christmas i guess, going to try joy-riding a saucer or something
 Flaise: :confused:
 Flaise: Reading text written by people on the internet never fails to make me feel incapable of comprehension and full of stupid at least once a day.
 Wontonimo: oh?
 Flaise: "joy-riding a saucer" ...?

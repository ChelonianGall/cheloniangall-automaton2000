 Java0xCAFEBABE: Initial Commit :grinning:
 CyberLemonade: did cg change font?
 Riyuk: A lot of little features lately
 Riyuk: The chat is now disabled from the IDE as well
 aCat: ouh yeah i see
 aCat: but can't you enable it back?
 eulerscheZahl: missing chat is a bug and reported already
 eeth: is there a way to output debug messages?
 b1ll1e: Yes, for python you can use: print("DEBUG", file=sys.stderr)
 eeth: ty.  is there a reference somewhere?
 eeth: [so i don't have to ask basic questions]
 b1ll1e: The problem usually gives you this info
 aCat: in defasult code for every puzzle/game and every language you should have this
 eeth: i'm on the "coders strike back" and i don't see anything about debug output, maybe i'm missing it.
 eeth: oh, my apologies - it's contained in a comment.  derp.
 Uljahn: nobody reads comments, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this is so much better than that
 jrke: where is my enemy&#160;;)

 aCat: :D
 CyberLemonade: how much space am I given during program execution?
 WINWINWIN: I think that the limit is 100K characters, Idk abt the memory limit
 CyberLemonade: not my code, my execution
 WINWINWIN: I dont understand execution space&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i think he asks for the volume of the CPU where is code is executed
 CyberLemonade: yes
 WINWINWIN: Did codingame give out that info?
 CyberLemonade: that's why I'm asking
 eulerscheZahl: no. and i don't see how that could be relevant
 CyberLemonade: I could create a GB of integers then?
 WINWINWIN: :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you actually mean the memory size
 eulerscheZahl: then why do you say yes to the physical size?
 eulerscheZahl: read the FAQ
 CyberLemonade: I'm confused about the terminology
 CyberLemonade: which FAQ?
 CyberLemonade: forum ig
 eulerscheZahl: go to the main page, scroll to the very bottom
 eulerscheZahl: not in the forum
 CyberLemonade: got it
 CyberLemonade: so this memory limit is NOT the size of my code?
 eulerscheZahl: that makes absolutely no sense
 CyberLemonade: so I can reserve upto 768MB during runtime :O
 WINWINWIN: I dont understand this in the rules
 WINWINWIN: Obfuscating your code as well as creating obstacles to its reading and understanding.
 WINWINWIN: Others can see your code?
 eulerscheZahl: staff can
 eulerscheZahl: and they will for cheat checking
 eulerscheZahl: they removed a few players in gold and legend after the contest
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, so unreadable code is bad? :sweat:
 CyberLemonade: I don't think it matters that much
 WINWINWIN: Thank god, mine is terrible with 0 comments :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary">https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary</a>this is disallowed
 WINWINWIN: What exactly does that do, did not understand
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/new-contests-rule/2895/9">https://forum.codingame.com/t/new-contests-rule/2895/9</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that mess is unreadable and you can't run cheat checking on it or check manually
 WINWINWIN: Understood, they do cheat somehow and then turn it into binary
 eulerscheZahl: that's the point: CG can't tell
 WINWINWIN: Yes, but how do they cheat other than what those college guys did?
 eulerscheZahl: and sometimes people just push their bots on github during the contest. and others steal it.
 eulerscheZahl: that's a disqualification too
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, so far I have just used github to go through agade and devYaoYH postmortems
 eulerscheZahl: go to github. enter "codingame &lt;contest name&gt;"you'll find some bots
 Uljahn: they removed T1024 in TAC for hardcoding the solution against reverse engineered validators
 Illedan: tac?
 eulerscheZahl: i thought he hardcoded seeds for testcases?
 JBM: no exactly
 eulerscheZahl: the accountant
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, but I cannot use them :P I wont understand them
 JBM: yes as eZ says
 JBM: he optimized seeds for tests one by one
 JBM: he still had a pretty decent search
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/thibpat/status/1263039132391149569">https://twitter.com/thibpat/status/1263039132391149569</a>someone read by playground \o/
 eulerscheZahl: by =&gt; my
 Uljahn: that was said to be hardcoding afair
 JBM: it was
 JBM: and it's still pretty debatable
 JBM: on the "what's optimization even supposed to be" front
 Illedan: Dammit, can't update my contribution&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 Illedan: Internal server erro
 Illedan: r
 eulerscheZahl: server error?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Illedan: When I click send
 CyberLemonade: I get java heapspace after 200MB :thinking:
 kovi: i was not there, but i must say disq. on hardcoding is controversial
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl dont understand how to use your playground, even if we download the replay what happends?
 CyberLemonade: they said 768MB
 kovi: (was not playing here at that time, but heard t1024 complaints)
 eulerscheZahl: for A*Craft CG learned and just used different validators for final ranking
 Marchete: ofc he complained, the prize was BIG
 eulerscheZahl: but i would have been really pissed as T1024
 eulerscheZahl: $10k i think
 Illedan: wow
 Illedan: I agree with t1k
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't want such tricks, just use different validators. as every other platform does
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder, codeforces, yandex algorithms, ...
 WINWINWIN: So they hardcoded the seed for the validators, figured them out and optimied the code for that?
 JBM: he just tried out different seeds, and reused the ones that scored best per case
 JBM: so as to get a less random global score
 WINWINWIN: Isnt that like when dbdr released the validators for code vs zombies and code of the rings?
 JBM: no
 JBM: he never extracted the validators
 eulerscheZahl: he was still solving on the server
 WINWINWIN: Ok
 Uljahn: he extracted some info about validators
 Uljahn: such as the number of entities
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan your PCR didn't survive the language update
 eulerscheZahl: i just fixed mine
 WINWINWIN: language update?
 eulerscheZahl: C# to .net core
 JBM: yes he deduced a minimum amount of info to be able to discriminate
 kovi: interesting, ooc was harder than pac
 WINWINWIN: Why isnt illedan last then? if the language update broke the bots?
 eulerscheZahl: how do you meansure that kovi?
 kovi: euler ranking&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: ooc lasted longer
 eulerscheZahl: and i lose focus quickly
 Marchete: :D
 kovi: contest leaderboard is best 3?
 Marchete: so euler, your graphical debugger isn't like recurs3, it's more a dump to png images
 Marchete: not a dashboard*
 Illedan: I will fix all my arena bots this weekend -.-
 Marchete: or do the lazy way, fix when they go down in leaderboards
 Kelkat: Can someone help me learn how to code.Im 13 and i dont understand anything
 BenWo: hi Kelkat
 BenWo: is there anything specific you're wanting to code for?
 eulerscheZahl: sorry Marchete was afkand yes: my bot can create pngs while playing
 eulerscheZahl: so i play twice: 1st to have all images, 2nd to do the actual debugging
 cegprakash: is there a referee for poker chip race
 eulerscheZahl: there's a leaked one

 struct: Legal for that turn
 struct: for blue
 eulerscheZahl: that's a lot of branching :o
 struct: The ones that remove 2 times are game ending
 struct: Because 1 was already removed before
 struct: you need to remove 3 rings total
 struct: But yeah, lots of moves sometimes
 struct: Also I opted to allow users to choose if they want legal moves on inputs or no
 struct: They will just need to output it on first turn
 Astrobytes: Smits will be running his meta-MCTS on this for the next decade
 eulerscheZahl: or you make it default ON.
 Ace-Code: :D
 eulerscheZahl: or you always give the moves. i can still ignore them
 Ace-Code: Hii
 struct: default is on
 Ace-Code: Nice to meet
 struct: Giving 200 moves might take a bit oif time
 eulerscheZahl: hm, valid point
 jrke: hey any suggestion how to pass Pacman silver
 struct: yes I even have suggestion to reach legend if you want
 jrke: yes plz

 jrke: thanks
 cegprakash: jrke let me check my if else
 cegprakash: I think I only check closest chip
 cegprakash: and either decide to catch it or run away from it
 jrke: for PCR
 cegprakash: and that's in bronze
 cegprakash: top 100 bronze
 jrke: about what u are talking
 jrke: Pacman or PCR
 cegprakash: poker chip race
 jrke: K
 cegprakash: most games go closer to stuff
 jrke: means goto nearest chip
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: yeah
 cegprakash: or run away from it
 jrke: Dunno what
 jrke: i am just giving command wait and my rank is 18 and 17 in wood 2
 jrke:&#160;;)
 cegprakash: just see if the closest chip is bigger than u or smaller than u
 IAmNoob: hi
 IAmNoob: boyz
 Marchete: my advice is to run away from PCR
 Marchete: and as fast as possible
 Marchete: there are many other multis around there
 Uljahn: if you're smaller than PCR
 struct: What should I do if a player doesnt have legal moves, but the other does?
 Illedan: Lose?
 Illedan: Check the board game rules?
 IcedBlackSapphire: play clash of code using Ruby feels like cheating
 Uljahn: ye, same as playing multi with C++ :smirk:
 IcedBlackSapphire: what's the benefit of c++ for multi?
 Marchete: speed,
 IcedBlackSapphire: how is it possible i run first testcase successfully, click submit and get 0% score?
 IcedBlackSapphire: are there more than 100 test cases lulz?
 IcedBlackSapphire: or is score calculation more complex than succeeding test cases / all test cases?
 Brokolis: If you hardcode, you can also get 0
 IcedBlackSapphire: ok, just wondering about the number of test cases. i didn't hardcode but probably missed some special case that only occured in the second test case
 Astrobytes: You need to pass all the testcases before submitting
 struct: oh no&#160;:/
 struct: It has a rule that I didnt add
 struct: There is only 51 stones or Yinsh
 struct: But on mine its unlimited&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Well, that shouldn't be too hard to fix right?
 struct: yeah I think one line should fix it
 struct: I guess ill do like the rules say
 struct: there must be a reason for this "rule"
 Astrobytes: Probably a wise choice
 struct: This also means that the limit is this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/2JlwVa1.png">https://i.imgur.com/2JlwVa1.png</a>
 Astrobytes: OK? I've forgotten most of the rules tbh lol
 struct: Player who removes most rings win
 struct: To remove a ring you must form a row of 5 stones of your color
 Astrobytes: There's something else to it tho no
 struct: Stones flip color when you jump over them
 struct: But I guess im gonna pick the 51 max stones rule
 struct: I checked some websites that have Yinsh and all have 51 stones rule
 Astrobytes: OK, cool
 WINWINWIN: AntiSquid are you SpiritusSancti?
 Marchete: confess it
 WINWINWIN: Wanted to thank AntiSquid for the Poker Chip Race referee
 WINWINWIN: that is the only reason that I could build a sim
 Marchete: you and everyone else
 Marchete: even with the referee it was a PITA
 WINWINWIN: Yes took me like 5 hours just to get the sim alone
 WINWINWIN: only because I had the referee and I used C# so some functions could be entirely copied
 jrke: hey how u guys predict opponent pod for attacking i am using x+vx and y+vy
 eulerscheZahl: that was some fun reversing the physics and collecting information from forum, blog articles, ...
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl, is pathfinder really necessary to do well in HyperSonic?
 WINWINWIN: As jrke managed to get a good legend rank without knowing BFS/DFS
 WINWINWIN: If not I would rather use a single dimensional arry of point objects to store the map
 struct: jrke most dont predict
 struct: most just use sim
 struct: BFS is a simple algorithm, you should not avoid learning it
 Scarfield: ^ +1&#160;:)
 CyberLemonade: why does drawing in UTTT count as a loss for me?
 jrke: ya struct thats why i learned BFS after Pac contest
 jrke: now learning DFS
 struct: replay CyberLemonade?
 jrke: WINWINWIN its not tough enough you can 
 jrke: i am coming in 10 min
 struct: " If nobody managed to get 3 marks aligned, the player that won the most smaller tic-tac-toe boards wins."
 CyberLemonade: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/468153527">https://www.codingame.com/replay/468153527</a>
 CyberLemonade: struct oh
 CyberLemonade: didn't notice that rule 
 eulerscheZahl: depends if you call gold "doing well" WINWINWIN. i always recommend writing your own pathfinding instead of using the built in
 MSmits: it<i>s a good way to practice aside from it easily being better</i>
 struct: Should I give last action or entire board?
 MSmits: CyberLemonade this is not true for all versions of uttt, just the one here
 struct: or both?
 MSmits: I prefer the statement to be as simple as possible. 
 MSmits: breakthrough has last action
 MSmits: and it works fine
 eulerscheZahl: i prefer full board
 struct: I guess I add both
 MSmits: my preference isnt strong... i can deal with either. Listen to euler.
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise you are forced to sim the game. and doesn't fit my workflow at all
 MSmits: ahh ok
 eulerscheZahl: i do: read all input, write to stderr
 MSmits: yeah my first boardgame bot version always has a full sim already
 eulerscheZahl: so with the full state i can copy that and debug offline. otherwise i have to copy the full move sequence
 MSmits: makes sense
 struct: I have something like this
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0524c1af-90e6-4cf7-8774-3ba4633b8246">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0524c1af-90e6-4cf7-8774-3ba4633b8246</a>
 MSmits: I like it
 eulerscheZahl: that was a reason i haven't touched breakthrough for a month or so. it annoyed me
 struct: uppercase = yours, lower case = opponent
 struct: R = ring, S = stone
 journeyvivek: what happened to spring contest
 struct: Also im giving the board in a different way from viewer
 eulerscheZahl: ended, in multiplayer section now
 struct: im not giving top to bottom
 Astrobytes: Heh, so we get to refer to our "ring pieces" hurhurhur
 struct: both left to right
 dbf: eulerscheZahl you need to watch stream from reCurse how to pack all state to bitstream so you can debug any game locally :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: i have my own method
 eulerscheZahl: and there's a stream about it (but not me streaming)
 eulerscheZahl: thibpat adapted it
 Astrobytes: But BitStream == InstaWin
 eulerscheZahl: nonsense
 Astrobytes: Obviously!
 struct: euler way is good too
 Astrobytes: I use both, depending on the game
 AntiSquid: that's what half of discord chat said after they saw the recurz stream, Astrobytes&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: I know, I'm playing on the bitstream meme
 struct: One thing is sure, I learned more from his stream, than from the rest of all streams, no offense to anyone
 AntiSquid: none taken
 struct: But he is also one of the few that streamed on C++
 struct: I dont really watch other language streamers
 eulerscheZahl: Neumann did too
 eulerscheZahl: but in baguette language
 AntiSquid: and seebomega
 struct: yeah in french
 struct:&#160;:/
 Neumann: Omelette du fromage
 ReborN: Baguette baguette
 AntiSquid: no english
 struct: I meant neuman
 Astrobytes: Oh that was Neumann's stream with the crap music right :P
 struct: What game did Seeb stream?
 Neumann: You misspelled "great music"
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: opinions are like assholes, everyone has one Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and it's easy to understand
 struct: What will be the next <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/C7JKqJa.png">https://i.imgur.com/C7JKqJa.png</a>
 struct:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd from the bottom i hope
 struct: I think I have Tzaar made 
 struct: But I didnt like it
 AntiSquid:&#160;? where is yinish??
 struct: soon
 AntiSquid: how about renaming to something less ambiguous&#160;?
 Illedan: :tada:
 Astrobytes: Stump. You just get loads of pieces and no instructions or win conditions. You have to figure it out.
 Illedan: Got my computer desk back :rocket:
 Astrobytes: You've finished moving now?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: But it's sold
 Astrobytes: Well, good start&#160;:)
 Illedan: So now I can live like normally for 3 months before the real moving
 Astrobytes: Until the night you have to sleep on top of boxes.
 reCurse: It's moving season
 Astrobytes: You're moving to your new apartment also reCurse?
 reCurse: Yeah this saturday
 Astrobytes: Nice, gl with the move
 reCurse: Surprisingly ready actually
 Astrobytes: Always helps. I've moved around a lot over  the years, from renting in London
 MSmits: I'm moving too, in about 3 months
 MSmits: but it's like 1 km
 AntiSquid: me too, one day for sure
 Astrobytes: I'm starting to feel left out here
 AntiSquid: struct all those games seem to be hexagonal ...
 AntiSquid: and somewhat similar
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: all these games can be played with the same material
 Astrobytes: Don't be hexist AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: buy hardware once, play a set of different games
 reCurse: There's even a hex in his profile picture
 AntiSquid: hex fetish
 Astrobytes: Hexy
 AntiSquid: wait hex means something else
 eulerscheZahl: the German "Hexe" means witch
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/361a8bd2-f322-44f4-8c21-e37afc6fe196">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/361a8bd2-f322-44f4-8c21-e37afc6fe196</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah, a hex is like a spell or curse
 Astrobytes: Yinsh and Yavalath are obviously cursed.
 MSmits: is it related to "hag"  ?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's a word for a witch, especially an old one
 MSmits: I see
 AntiSquid: Die Hexe is thought to derivate from Old High German hagzissa meaning witch, and the Middle High German hecse with the same meaning. The modern English word 'hag' comes from the same roots.31 Oct 2018
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: Who knew Squiddy was the Oracle of Germanic etymology
 struct: Should I be indulgent and allow for wrong actions if at least the first action is right?
 struct: Imagine player first move was right, but second was wrong
 struct: Should player lose?
 Astrobytes: What do the rules say?
 struct: Well you cant do a wrong action 
 struct: I will just timeout player
 eulerscheZahl: you give all the valid moves, right?
 struct: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: so it's easy to print a valid move. your fault if you don't
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: Also you must remove a 5 in a row if you make a move and create 1
 struct: if you dont
 struct: you will timeout
 struct: You will lose*
 struct: Its the rules
 struct: In your opinion, should I do multiple frames, or make the frame longer
 struct: example if player does 1 action, frame duration = 1 sec, if player does 3 actions, frame duration = 3 sec
 struct: But all stays in same frame
 struct: Or i can do 1 action per frame
 Illedan: Wow, seems too many validators kills upload -.-
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even surprised
 Astrobytes: Maybe not enough validators :P
 eulerscheZahl: wait: your own upload or uploads in general?
 Illedan: my own
 Illedan: Worked with 150 validators
 Illedan: not with 450, 300 or 250
 Illedan: trying 200 now
 eulerscheZahl: calm down
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: is uploading still a mess?
 eulerscheZahl: got much better
 eulerscheZahl: you don't need 5 attempts till it builds
 struct: :D
 struct: Do you guys have any opinion about the frame thing?
 eulerscheZahl: multiple
 eulerscheZahl: easier to step through
 struct: true, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: negative example of how not to do it: pakiptcha
 ZarthaxX: pikaptcha?
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Illedan: Close enough :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468172164">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468172164</a>nightmare to analyze this during the contest
 ZarthaxX: pakichu
 ZarthaxX: wtf is that frame
 struct: lol
 struct: if you use arrows you dont understand anything
 eulerscheZahl: and the zoom and moving on edges
 eulerscheZahl: you don't even know how it jumped
 ZarthaxX: glad i didnt do this
 struct: Dont even know if zoom module is fixed yet
 eulerscheZahl: so of course i had to approve it as a puzzle: if CG thinks it's fine to dump it on us as a contest, i want puzzle solvers suffer too
 RedBlur: Hello
 struct: Hello
 Astrobytes: Hello
 Snef: Hello
 jacek: Hello
 Astrobytes: Hey Snef, what are you currently using for Trolls vs Castles?
 eulerscheZahl: why are so many people playing this?
 Astrobytes: To decide J'aime, Bof or Merde...
 Snef: Astrobytes a real IA
 Snef: =&gt; 2 ifs
 Astrobytes: Ah, the One True AI
 eulerscheZahl: do you bruteforce everything?
 Snef: i do'nt sim at all
 eulerscheZahl: btw some great trolling from darkhorse64<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/should-c-c-c-be-nerfed/184758/11">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/should-c-c-c-be-nerfed/184758/11</a>
 Snef: i tried to do a smitsimax i'm not sure if it's bug or not but it doesn't find a good strategyu
 Snef: -u
 eulerscheZahl: but still noone complaining about the overpowered D language. i'm disappointed
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: Snef, ask Smits when he's around, he'll help you debug it a bit
 Astrobytes: well, help you determine if it's a bug or not at least
 Snef: yea
 Snef: it kinda seem logic that it doesn't find any good play anyway
 struct: Multiple frames done
 JBM: heu eulerscheZahl do you know if I have some degree of control on the number of frames per turn with the sdk entity module?
 eulerscheZahl: great
 struct: yes jbm
 struct: you can do multiple frames
 eulerscheZahl: you have to create at least 1 frame per turn
 JBM: right now i'm doing rather complex stuff playing with the t in commitEntities
 JBM: but for some other project I'd need to insert real pausable frames in there
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: my planned post was much more rude. I think we are a the same level that people complaining there is a bug in a puzzle solved by 15000 people
 eulerscheZahl: you just don't call any players in the onTurn() function
 eulerscheZahl: then you get a frame for free
 JBM: ah, ok
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to adjust the maxTurns to account for that. it counts empty frames as well
 JBM: is it capped CG-side?
 Illedan: 3k or something
 JBM: that should do ^^ thx
 eulerscheZahl: i think you can even go a little higher
 darkhorse64: My IA for Trolls and Castles is 7 lines and one if
 struct: I think I saw 5k before
 eulerscheZahl: the old SDK version made the tab crash somewhere around 2k frames. but that'f xied now
 Illedan: LOL
 Illedan: I can make a new contribution with 400 validators
 eulerscheZahl: that's fixed*
 Illedan: :D
 JBM: it took a lot of grumbling and moaning, but i'm started to feel creative with the turns' concept
 eulerscheZahl: and darkhorse64 i know there "the puzzle is broken" guys all too well :D
 Xlos: Are clash of code rating changes based on placement or ranking?
 Xlos: Err placement or time
 eulerscheZahl: placement
 eulerscheZahl: which depends on the time
 Illedan: Anyone manages to try 1 game here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/842433580526aa320a0c5cb360f46e74a1d840">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/842433580526aa320a0c5cb360f46e74a1d840</a>&#160;?

 struct: at least first test case
 JBM: getting CG internal errors when trying to update now&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan you broke it
 Illedan: Me and my 400 validators?!
 Illedan: Naaah
 struct: Not now
 struct: That I have yinsh almost ready
 reCurse: Lies
 eulerscheZahl: yinsh today or delete
 struct: Today is sure
 reCurse: That was yesterday or delete
 reCurse: Neither happened
 struct: I can sumit as it is
 eulerscheZahl: ban him
 struct: submit*
 JBM: must be something in my package, submitting the old one works
 JBM: when can't i have an actual error message?!
 JBM: whose can i write the proper pronoun
 Icebox: What's the particular strength of beamsearch that made it so good on spring chall?
 Icebox: I'm lowkey missing how it's better than say, DFS
 ZarthaxX: have a big depth
 ZarthaxX: if you consider dfs and bfs to depth X
 ZarthaxX: they should explore the same
 kovi: i dont know either
 kovi: i still have dfs and reached #1 on multi
 Icebox: :thinking:
 Icebox: Okay, at least that means it's not thaaaat stupid of a question :D
 kovi: probably lucky, but long term cgstats show its not pure luck
 ZarthaxX: you can explore way mor depth with beam sacrificing optimal solutions
 ZarthaxX: it works more when your discarding heuristic is somehow accurate
 ZarthaxX: in hypersonic i guess it shows better
 kovi: if you play onebypne, increasing depth gave no bonus
 kovi: sorry. if you play pac by pac, you can reach good depth with dfs
 kovi: and increasing depth above 16 didnt give me reasonable boost
 Illedan: Think Search Race is ready for approval. Anyone wanna have a look?&#160;:)
 Snef: yep
 Illedan: New link now btw
 Illedan: Wonder if 400 validators will ddos CG :thinking:
 struct: oh god
 struct: How much wil lit take if I just output default code
 struct: 600*400*50
 Illedan: Default code wont consume 50 ms
 struct: ah true
 Snef: leaderboard isn't possible Illedan&#160;?
 Snef: i thought you said it was
 Illedan: Not on the contribution&#160;:(
 Illedan: Will be once it is approved
 Snef: oh ok
 struct: 200 minutes?
 struct: is my math wrong?
 struct: most likely
 struct: lol
 Illedan: Divide by parallell servers
 Snef: 20 min i think
 kovi: oh its optim, i have to play it to reach top3
 eulerscheZahl: or you make sure it won't get approved
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Snef: but ia would get 190 turn avg i think (for good ones) so about 6/7 minuts for a submit
 eulerscheZahl: 400 seems totally overkill to me as well
 Snef: more like 250 in fact so 8-9 min*
 struct: I dont like this 51 stones limit&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: new move generator?
 struct: I just need one if to add this rule
 struct: So its fine
 struct: but game seems so empty 
 struct: Ill keep it like this I think
 struct: euler its not possible to getinput from player and then send data is it?
 struct: in same turn
 Astrobytes: 100% on the 400 validators, didn't take that long actually
 Astrobytes: But no search, so that might be problematic with 400 validators
 struct: I think Yinsh is "ready"
 struct: at least for WIP
 Illedan: 100 then? :P 
 Illedan: Wanted anti hardcode
 struct: Illedan I dont mind 400 validators
 Illedan: but might be antimotivation too
 struct: but imagine this scenario
 struct: you can have multiple submits in optimization at once
 struct: I think 5 or 6
 struct: On same optimization
 struct: if you take max time for each validator 
 Astrobytes: And if a bunch are searching and using up that 50ms...
 struct: This will stress servers surely
 eulerscheZahl: single player csb promotion
 Astrobytes: Maybe darkhorse's idea of handpicked interesting maps would be better? Not sure.
 struct: Games are long too, its not short validators
 struct: its at worst case 600 turns
 Illedan: 10 small ones10 hard handpicked and 80 randomIs that ok? :P
 Snef: 100 is minimum i think so yeah
 darkhorse64: 1h computation time
 Snef: 100 test would give about 2-3 min
 darkhorse64: 100 * 600 * 50 / 1000 + 100 = 3100s on one server
 darkhorse64: wort time
 darkhorse64: *worst*
 Illedan: 50 is my final offer
 Illedan: but everyone will hardcode :sob:
 kovi: not me
 struct: Go 100
 Astrobytes: No I'll be searching, I never hardcode
 struct: Illedan what if you add a timeout like CSB?
 struct: need to reach checkpoint on X
 Illedan: on CSB it is 100
 Illedan: and that is just 6 checkpoints on 600 turns..
 struct: ok a  lap in 200 turns
 struct: or your bot is not good
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: 200 turns a lap might work. Else you can't beat it in 600 anyhow :P
 AntiSquid: and make a police car stop your car instead of timeout
 Astrobytes: minimum lap time is map-dependent tho
 struct: or you can eval car
 struct: if it is not better in n turns
 struct: get out
 struct: You remove driver license
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 Illedan:  Liker Number shift? :P You have to pass 10 levels and get the password to play the real optim .D
 struct: CG should just stop submit once 1 validator fails
 struct: I will submit Yinsh, but I will work on design after
 struct: No changes will be made to refere
 struct: Unless its wrong
 struct: Inputs will stay like this
 Astrobytes: Today, is an historic day. Day of the Yinsh.
 cegprakash: hey Illedan
 cegprakash: I hate u for BitRunner
 cegprakash: that friction
 struct: lol
 struct: Legend yet?
 Illedan: Why?
 cegprakash: my simu didn't work
 Illedan: Wrong friction? :P
 YurkovAS: Search Racescore 100% (400 tests), 140146.2
 cegprakash: I assumed next position = current pos + current velocity
 cegprakash: and it's not working
 Illedan: Nice YurkovAS :D But I will have to remove some tests :P
 Illedan: And I'll create some fun levels
 Astrobytes: I got 147217.56
 Illedan: I got 80&#160;%&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Go home Illedan :P
 Illedan: haha, didn't try too hard yet  xD
 struct: Is it good idea to let player remove code generated by stub?
 darkhorse64: - 3 * vel does not work&#160;! Call MK
 struct: im gonna call him on discord
 Illedan: Why do you need players to remove code struct?
 struct: for example im giving option to allow player to choose if he wants to get legal moves or not
 struct: I could not give the for loop of actions at all
 struct: or I can just make action count = 0
 struct: before the loop
 struct: I guess its fine to just set the action Count to 0
 struct: Illedan on stub do you know how to write comments in prints?
 struct: Like I have 2 outputs, is there a way to see which is which
 cegprakash: is there a referee for BOTG?
 struct: yes
 cegprakash: cant find

 struct: Watch out for the bugs
 Astrobytes: And that leaderboard. Absolutely ridden with bugs.
 cegprakash: shutup
 cegprakash: see my rank  on pacman now
 Astrobytes: &lt;3 you ceg
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZarthaxX: what with it?
 struct: not even gold
 Astrobytes: Yo Zarthropod
 cegprakash: it says I rekt u ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: cegprakash and i rekt you in global rank
 ZarthaxX: and in contest points
 ZarthaxX: wanna keep talkign about ranks?
 ZarthaxX: i couldnt play much anyway, congratz for beign 24/7 and surpassing me ONCE
 ZarthaxX: i didnt told you i rekt u all the other times
 struct: Oh
 struct: oh no
 struct: Illedan or euler here?
 ZarthaxX: so please continue doing your stuff
 struct: ah its fine
 struct: get gud ZarthaxX
 eulerscheZahl: :wave:
 cegprakash: u asked for it ZarthaxX not me
 cegprakash: I was talking with Astrobytes
 cegprakash: why did u come on my way
 struct: ceg wil destroy you, just like he destroyed you on contest
 ZarthaxX: i JUST ASKED
 ZarthaxX: what with your rank
 eulerscheZahl: struct you summoned me
 struct: euler pings you too?
 ZarthaxX: and you reacted
 cegprakash: u are using caps now?
 ZarthaxX: nvm you are a waste of time
 eulerscheZahl: i just came back to my PC and saw "euler"
 Snef: :popcorn:
 struct: :popcorn:
 Scarfield: then it did summon you&#160;:)
 cegprakash: don't use capslock on me
 eulerscheZahl: in case you asked a question before: i didn't read it
 struct: I was uplodaing multi
 Astrobytes: I LIKE CAPS LOCK
 struct: and it said disk full
 struct: :p
 eulerscheZahl: CG server disk?
 ZarthaxX: disk full?
 Scarfield: and fellas, friendly banter is fine, keep it civil&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot!
 ZarthaxX: cg disk?
 ZarthaxX: wat
 struct: I guess
 struct: cant 
 struct: i refreshed
 struct: now it works
 ZarthaxX: you guys are flooding the server with multis
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 struct: The options were like
 struct: Y/N/C
 struct: The C was done by default
 struct: which i guess its cancel
 eulerscheZahl: yes no cancel?
 Uljahn: or continue
 struct: Im dumb im submiting the code with debug stuff
 cegprakash: hey I'm just wondering if I precomupute MOD[32767][10] would it speed up my sims
 cegprakash: as I use&#160;% everywhere
 Uljahn: yes
 struct: Depends
 Scarfield: no
 Scarfield: now choose an answer :D
 cegprakash: as long as it worked for someone it's worth trying
 ZarthaxX: cegprakash depends on how much it costs to read memory
 Uljahn: why even ask when you can profile :relieved:
 ZarthaxX: i mean it realtes to cache helping you
 ZarthaxX: worth the try
 cegprakash: they say&#160;% is too expensive
 struct: go avx
 ZarthaxX: it is..
 ZarthaxX: unless you have&#160;% 2^k
 ZarthaxX: that has an easy fix
 reCurse: They say driving a car is too expensive so I flew to the moon instead
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 cegprakash: jz c++11 prints 2147483647 as RAND_MAX
 cegprakash: that's something I can't precompute
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes also, Zahropod lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I wonder why
 struct: that is the max
 ZarthaxX: AstroPod CSB version?
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 eulerscheZahl: caching a modulo? that idea is new to me
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/F3ZWWX">https://ideone.com/F3ZWWX</a>
 Astrobytes: See, you're doing great at this now Zarthlet
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 ZarthaxX: Astrobysphere
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you are still making fun with names, FarthaxX?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl lets find a way to cache MOD
 reCurse: xXZarthaXx
 Astrobytes: oilerShadesAll
 Scarfield: sqarerootNegativeOne
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl that's offensive
 Scarfield: Zathlete
 ZarthaxX: thank god all these mutated names dont ping me
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Nice Garfield
 Scarfield: ty GastroBite :p
 Astrobytes: :D I actually used to use Gastrocyte (elsewhere) when I was cheffing
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/F3ZWWX">https://ideone.com/F3ZWWX</a> 
 cegprakash: #define doesn't seem to work
 Astrobytes: ceg wth are you trying to do?
 cegprakash: trying to modify RAND_MAX
 Astrobytes: Why?
 cegprakash: RAND_MAX is so huge
 cegprakash: I don't want that many
 reCurse: I don't want to say anything
 reCurse: I just want to see what happens
 Astrobytes: I'm fairly lost for words quite frankly
 Amperclock: Hi there, can someone help me with a quick question about handling json data with Python&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Ask it and see&#160;;)
 struct: Where can I place bet?
 Amperclock: I can use "as json_file:" to open a json file. But I already have the content of a file in a variable. How can I tell python to understand the content as json&#160;?
 Amperclock: I can print the content of the variable in a file, and then reopen it as json, but it's a bit stupid
 eulerscheZahl: that IDEone code :D
 eulerscheZahl: who sends it straight to thedailywtf?
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 reCurse: Like I said, wait and it may get better
 eulerscheZahl: true
 Amperclock: alright i can use json.loads(myVar)
 struct: Now I need to write statement
 eulerscheZahl: or do it like JBM
 struct: I submited with default statement
 Astrobytes: Sometimes you have to say/type these things out loud to find your solution Amperclock&#160;;)
 struct: first print outside of while loop is just to choose if you want legalactions or no
 eulerscheZahl: i always think i'm done, time to publish. then when i want to export i realize there's something essential missing
 struct: Ill rework entire viewe
 struct: viewer*
 Astrobytes: Like gfx :P
 struct: I want to flip pieces
 struct: with animation
 Astrobytes: CAn't you just swap the colour
 struct: Yes, but i want it to look good&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Meh. Aesthetics are overrated :P
 reCurse: Wrong
 Amperclock: RuberDuckyDebbuging I guess
 eulerscheZahl: i think UI helped to attract some to Onitama who wouldn't have played otherwise
 reCurse: Presentation is always important
 Astrobytes: You did see the sitck-out tongue reCurse?&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: *sticky-out
 reCurse: Could mean anything
 Astrobytes: Grrr internet chat
 Astrobytes: Onitama is lovely looking eulerscheZahl
 Scarfield: struct, your avatar body has a weird shape, i fixed it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sl9b1p">https://prnt.sc/sl9b1p</a>
 struct: perfect
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: I think ill still leave contribution on private
 struct: There is no point if there is no statement
 reCurse: That didn't stop Illedan
 Astrobytes: And it's perfect for CG. Zero-information.
 eulerscheZahl: illedan even uploaded it twice to collect more upvotes :D
 struct: Now i need to find tric trac
 Astrobytes: Ping him
 reCurse: That's why I say never trust floating islands
 struct: trictrac here?
 trictrac: yes
 Astrobytes: Yinsh
 struct: I got a new version of yinsh
 struct: But no statement yet
 eulerscheZahl: i always have to think about the mickey mouse characters when i see that nickname
 trictrac: thank you. I will try
 struct: wait ill make it public
 Astrobytes: Mickey Mouse characters?
 struct: I give legalmoves with yinsh notation
 eulerscheZahl: Tick, Trick und TrackHewey, Dewey and Luis or something like that in the original
 struct: Now all moves must be made on same tunr
 struct: turn*
 struct: not like before
 eulerscheZahl: German version renamed most of them
 struct: Im not even sure what timeout is, I think its 100ms but I miight change it later
 trictrac: in French too
 Astrobytes: Hewey, Dewey and Louie (sp?) were Duck Tales tho?
 eulerscheZahl: Huey, Dewey, and Louie
 eulerscheZahl: appeared in the mickey mouse magazine
 Astrobytes: Ah. Was never really into Mickey tbh
 trictrac: trictrac is the name of two particular locations in the 10x10 international draught
 Astrobytes: I thought it was some game like backgammon?
 cegprakash: I almost done
 cegprakash: caching mod
 struct: Also stones limit is 51 in board now
 struct: Im not sure if this is good or no, but its on oficial rules
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/3NeYzr">https://ideone.com/3NeYzr</a>
 cegprakash: now how do I patent this thing
 struct: Dont need patent if noone wants it
 cegprakash: I'll add this and see the profiler difference now
 eulerscheZahl: you don't publish something before you have a patent
 eulerscheZahl: now it's publicly available and cant be patented anymore
 cegprakash: it's not a rocket science or anything
 cegprakash: just a respect from our community if this works
 cegprakash: that's enough
 Astrobytes: But it's got a ceg variable in it eulerscheZahl
 kovi: you can patent it in UIS
 kovi: US
 Scarfield: i wish you could somehow limit that range of the rand function without that work around :p
 reCurse: That's not how RNG works
 cegprakash: u can create a scarfield variable instead of ceg variable
 cegprakash: that's the limiter
 Scarfield: bool Scarfield = false;
 eulerscheZahl: int chokudaiWidth = 1;
 cegprakash: it has to be a power of two -1
 reCurse: You should also cache additions
 reCurse: Maybe you'll reach performances unheard of
 eulerscheZahl: can we cache constants?
 Astrobytes: int chokudaiWidth = ceg; Ultimate power.
 cegprakash: seriously guys?
 cegprakash: not even 1 in favor of me
 Westicles: The game has crashed. Please contact the author and enclose the following error:
 struct: Which game?
 eulerscheZahl: which game?
 reCurse: Which game
 Westicles: NS
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: i saw this day coming
 struct: ufff
 eulerscheZahl: i know exactly why
 Astrobytes: OH you mentioned that before
 Westicles: 590 moves + 1 for the header
 reCurse: You didn't cache modulo
 reCurse: That's why
 eulerscheZahl: need to read some lines in 1 turn
 reCurse: Luckily for you there is code ready
 Icebox: :popcorn: reCurse
 reCurse: Patented but negotiable hopefully
 Icebox: please cache your modulos guys
 eulerscheZahl: give me a few minutes to fix it Westicles
 Westicles: oh no, that means I have to keep going?
 reCurse: No choice.
 Illedan: reCurse, did you really need a statement for mine? :D
 reCurse: I was just saying you established a precedent for "statements? aint nobody got time for that"
 Illedan: I see no problem with pushing a WIP game without the best statement&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: there is some unfairness with the timeout: depends on your number of moves, not the level
 eulerscheZahl: so a shorter solution with less moves to clear can get higher
 eulerscheZahl: i just hoped this day would never come
 Astrobytes: If it can, it will.
 reCurse: There's a saying which goes "if it's 0.1% repro that's the next day after shipping"
 Astrobytes: lol, seems accurate enough
 cegprakash: I got a 3% speed up
 cegprakash: with MOD caching
 struct: wow
 struct: Why do you want to cache mod anyways?
 struct: What for?
 eulerscheZahl: might be a different server
 cegprakash: for my sim
 cegprakash: I use a lot of random 
 cegprakash: like 10000s of random in just 2000 simulations
 struct: What rand do you use?
 struct: rand()&#160;?
 cegprakash: I still use rand
 cegprakash: but instead of&#160;% I do &amp;
 Astrobytes: I'm not getting involved in another discussion about rng, rand etc with you ceg :D
 struct: I think you could have saved sometime
 struct: by just googling
 Astrobytes: The last one was too painful.
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh look yinsh
 struct: unfinished
 cegprakash: I don't get u guys
 struct: no statement
 struct: bad visual
 BenjaminUrquhart: "The aim of this game is to win."You should keep this, quality description
 eulerscheZahl: default template
 BenjaminUrquhart: aw
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles should be fixed now
 Illedan: Uhm, tried to update my contribution with 50 validators and some better testcases. But now I can't run games&#160;:/
 Illedan: Anyone else gets an error now?
 Westicles: Euler, yep thanks

 eulerscheZahl: and the leaderboard isn't deleted&#160;:)
 Illedan: It's not approved yet

 Illedan: It had autocomplete
 Illedan: I had to take it

 Illedan: Nah, I just think it might work :P
 Astrobytes: Simulated "Anhealing" was the best tho
 Illedan: yeyeye
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: where did you see that? :D
 Astrobytes: earlier version of SR
 Illedan: Do I need to call my test testN.json?!
 cegprakash: leaderboard crashed bcoz of my MOD caching?
 cegprakash: oh god what did I do
 eulerscheZahl: yes Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: i remember there was a contribution where the user created testN.json and validatorN.json.On submit nothing happened. No validators found
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: the forest fire puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: and IDE didn't show any validators at that point. So it wasn't to be expected
 Astrobytes: Loading...Computing score

 Astrobytes: I always thought it was a seal
 Scarfield: wait, your avator is not a seal?=
 Scarfield: avatar*
 Astrobytes: Seal eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: seal. should have known that word
 AntiSquid: Grey seal
 AntiSquid: why is it called a "keggel" robbe though&#160;?
 AntiSquid: kegel *
 cegprakash: &amp; works fast but my random performs bad
 cegprakash: may be my rand()&amp;ceg is biased
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, presumably as seals are pinnipeds
 JBM: i saw this mentioned earlier up and i am getting curious about it
 Astrobytes: kegel can be cone or pin
 JBM: when/why does a contrib reupload reset the leaderboard?
 Illedan: Meh, I'll create a 3rd contribution and be done with this -.-

 Enknable: Hey, looking for a bit of directions if anyone has a second or insight:I want to build a simple real-time multiplayer in browser game. Stack preferences? Any articles for direction, pitfalls..etc?
 Astrobytes: LB issue? (not trolling ceg)
 Astrobytes: Enknable hi o/ and why not just build a multi for CG?&#160;;)
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a> might have something you can use Enknable
 Enknable: haha Hey Astrobytes It's for a class I'm taking. Maybe if I can get it going I'd make a multi! 
 Astrobytes: Ah I see
 reCurse: There's probably too many answers to that question
 Enknable: That's a good resource Scarfield, I'm looking more for if there's a preferred front end or tools that are already in place
 AntiSquid: search for a tutorial&#160;!?
 AntiSquid: ah wait
 Enknable: Yeah I'm definitely scouring, but I thought this would be a great place for some initial direction
 eulerscheZahl: even unity has an option to export your project as a browser game
 AntiSquid: there's lots of tools if you're ok with JS
 reCurse: Your requirements are too vague
 AntiSquid: indeed
 Astrobytes: What is your brief for the project?
 Enknable: Yeah it's a course in full stack dev, so JS would be good. Basically just something where 3 or 4 people can move around in a canvas and shoot at each other
 Astrobytes: HTML + JS
 Astrobytes: *Plenty* info out there on that
 AntiSquid: i mean there are a lot of engines 
 AntiSquid: ok let me find my huge ass list
 reCurse: Depending on the game you might not even need an engine
 AntiSquid: actually nvm, i will just google it
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=best+browser+game+engines">https://www.google.com/search?q=best+browser+game+engines</a>

 Astrobytes: reCurse is right, if it's nothing too complex you can do it yourself. Are there constraints for your project or just anything goes?
 AntiSquid: read bottom bit of the last link
 Enknable: THere's some requirements that I need to have a backend that CRUD's and really basic benchmarks. 
 Enknable: yeah AntiSquid that seems like what info I need
 Enknable: I was looking at socket.io but not sure if I should have the server doing all the processing, or if I can create a client side processing
 AntiSquid: there's much simpler stuff out there though, i don't remember them all
 AntiSquid: for example this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.html5quintus.com/">http://www.html5quintus.com/</a>

 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: But the test inside was wrong
 Illedan: Now you have something to drift along
 Illedan: :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: But that's not something my NN trained for
 reCurse: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: :joy:
 Illedan: Which of them?
 reCurse: The drift
 reCurse: That violates the mapgen specs
 Illedan: Perfect
 Illedan: Create a gif for us to see how it fails?
 Enknable: Yeah the problem is probably that there are so many. Asking a room full of experts seemed like a good approach
 reCurse: It doesn't fail
 reCurse: It's just not as good as it could
 reCurse: Because having so many CPs in quick succession was not something that ever happens
 reCurse: And giffing is too much trouble
 Illedan: Does the NN handle Hold the line?
 reCurse: It zig zags
 Astrobytes: 100% 17877.61
 AntiSquid: i would join a web dev discord server instead and ask Enknable, i am sure you got a lot more suppor there
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/keD8rZp">https://discord.gg/keD8rZp</a>
 Illedan: Time to approve Astrobytes&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Just about to
 Enknable: Will do, Thanks AntiSquid
 struct: tokyo doesnt look bad
 struct: 114 turnsa
 Astrobytes: Meh, I have to test every language before I can approve?
 struct: No
 struct: Only D
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/7Kyw3v1">https://ibb.co/7Kyw3v1</a>
 struct: Because most use it
 Astrobytes: (not that I'm complaining about the more robust approach)
 cegprakash: leaderboard stuck at 10 games
 jacek: submiting broken?
 cegprakash: yes jacek
 Illedan: Search race is consuming some servers ^^
 struct: Astrobytes testing all languages would be a pain
 Astrobytes: F'ing right
 jacek: mining illedan coins
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure that should be a requirement for a single person validating
 Illedan: I can test them all now
 Astrobytes: If you do that, I'll approve
 reCurse: 100% 11246
 Illedan: Just checking it drives in circles
 Illedan: My stolen bot is at 18k :o
 reCurse: stolen?
 Snef: cheater reCurse
 Illedan: Someone sent me som -3 vel or whatever. :P
 Astrobytes: Illedan is the cheater, bot stealer
 Astrobytes: I hope you at least paid for it :P
 AntiSquid: 3 silver coins
 Astrobytes: in USD
 Illedan: Damn, there is a lot of languages
 AntiSquid: sorry, probably a bad joke 
 reCurse: Is there a bug or something
 reCurse: I had a model at 96%
 reCurse: It was at 10495
 reCurse: Do you score less the more you fail?
 Illedan: Losing gives 0 points
 reCurse: Nice
 reCurse: ez #1
 struct: lol
 Illedan: But you have less&#160;% so you get lower on the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Ofc, the leaderboard is bugged. And the referee. Lord ceg says so.
 reCurse: Would be more fun if it scored 1k points
 Astrobytes: jacek just reported leaderboard/submission issue on discord
 reCurse: Rejected
 Illedan: Should I add 1k points for fail?
 reCurse: Do you want to get approved? :P
 Illedan: Ok!
 Illedan: On it
 Astrobytes: FLT_MAX or gtfo
 struct: or you can reverse
 struct: and give more points for faster win
 struct: and sort leaderboard on desc
 reCurse: So submits are broken?&#160;:(
 jacek: AutomatonNN fix leaderboard
 cegprakash: did anyone achieve GA in BOTG?
 AutomatonNN: hello to you all
 AntiSquid: does that include optimization category?
 cegprakash: I miserably failed and ended up in silver in BOTG
 cegprakash: hey reCurse yes
 cegprakash: it's broken
 cegprakash: for past 1 hour or so
 reCurse: Can I get a second opinion
 jacek: youre ugly
 Astrobytes: Just submitted in Trolls vs Castles, so pending contribs seem OK
 AntiSquid: opti works
 reCurse: Hm
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/7Kyw3v1">https://ibb.co/7Kyw3v1</a>
 jacek: leaderboard stops at 10 games
 cegprakash: stuck at 10 games reCurse
 Astrobytes: bear with me tho', see if it progresses

 cegprakash: so many computing
 cegprakash: but no movement
 cegprakash: all at 0%
 Uljahn: i've stuck at 94% for an hour in PR2
 AntiSquid: they need to stop submit spamming
 Astrobytes: Yep, it's freezing
 Illedan: Hopefully not my 400 validator thingy :angel:
 Illedan: Or you get the first 10 games every time?
 jacek: 10 games are for free
 Astrobytes: Got first 30 in TvC, stuck at 0%
 Illedan: Astrobytes, it crashes in Pascal -.-
 reCurse: I bet it's Illedan that broke it
 Illedan: Anyone knows pascal?
 Illedan: I bet too
 Illedan: xD
 Astrobytes: euler does, but he'll be asleep
 Astrobytes: Tbali
 Illedan: I guess those who code pascal can fix that one language&#160;:/
 reCurse: Is that number above, equal or below those who code D
 Astrobytes: Hm, TBali is not online, he loves PAscal
 Astrobytes: Gotta be more than D
 DaBestest: Hello everyone! Stay safe and social distance for the safety of everyone!! Stay Positive!! :grinning:
 Astrobytes: Right.
 reCurse: Thanks&#160;!!
 DaBestest: @Arcene Thanks for the follow!!
 Illedan: Ok it is only pascal
 Illedan: Guess 1 out of 20 is ok :P
 reCurse: Don't forget to like and subscribe
 DaBestest: :grin:
 Illedan: reCurse, now if you submit 100&#160;% failing =&gt; 50k points.
 reCurse: Good
 reCurse: I'd approve but you broke submits
 Illedan: Not on this optim
 Illedan: you can still submit here
 Astrobytes: So you want us to approve your CG-wrecking optim now huh
 Illedan: I guess it is the job picking players and matching them
 wlesavo: in our school the used to teach pascal, dont know if it is still the case
 wlesavo: they*
 Astrobytes: PascalCase?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: Looks like the stub is broken for pascal anyway
 Illedan: Anything else to fix?
 wlesavo: it
 wlesavo: fix it
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5073253abaee2588a9f6daa66ac49205fa5a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5073253abaee2588a9f6daa66ac49205fa5a</a>
 Illedan: gogo wlesavo
 reCurse: Statement could be a bit clearer
 Illedan: Sure, got examples?
 Astrobytes: The mixed capitalisation of lettering in the tags is mildly annoying.
 Astrobytes: :P
 Illedan: Fixed
 Stanworld: i just submit , but it freezed to the 10th play ... and 0%
 Stanworld: any problem on server? 
 wlesavo: i like # Made by Illedan in stub
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: Submits currently broken Stanworld, staff are notified
 reCurse: I don't think id vs index is clear enough
 reCurse: "selected randomly every race" = not true
 reCurse: "a valid sequence of actions"&#160;?
 Stanworld: thanks Astrobytes
 Arcene: welcome @DaBestest . Thanks
 reCurse: The collision with checkpoint could be more detailed
 reCurse: "3 &lt;= checkpoints &lt;= 8" is wrong
 Astrobytes: Since you give it 3 times
 reCurse: Or even basic stuff like what angle means
 reCurse: 0 = pointing where?
 reCurse: Is it CW or CCW
 reCurse: If it's a beginner game it could use beginner explanations
 Astrobytes: And leagues, with tutorials, and no useful input until gold. Fix it Illedan
 Illedan: I thought about having players to write "v0" or "v1" for which version of input they wanted
 Illedan: Nice feedback reCurse, thx!
 reCurse: Or just make it expert only
 reCurse: I fail to see the interest of target point
 Astrobytes: (I was joking btw)
 Illedan: Drive car. You can figure it out. GL HF.^Expert statement
 Astrobytes: Works for me :P
 struct: my yinsh statement
 struct: 404
 MonZtaDeluxe: guys does someone else have the same problem, that he can't submit his code to the ladder?
 pb4: Thanks basically the Trolls vs Castles statement
 MonZtaDeluxe: it's in code4life
 pb4: that's*
 Illedan: Yeah, stolen from JBM
 Astrobytes: Yes MonZtaDeluxe, submits currently broken, staff are aware
 MonZtaDeluxe: ok good - thanks
 reCurse: Illedan is currently being banned for it
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 pb4: 500 validators --&gt; banned from CG&#160;?
 reCurse: Next SDK: maximum of 20 validators
 Illedan: Blame pb4. He didn't want hardcoded solutions
 Illedan: :D
 pb4: :innocent:
 reCurse: If you don't want hardcoded solutions
 reCurse: Just make it a damn multi
 JBM: CSB needs more fog of war :thinking:
 reCurse: I keep repeating myself :P
 AntiSquid: but isn't it possible to make the validators sort of random?
 Illedan: True
 JBM: i'll suggest it to TBali
 Astrobytes: reCurse does have a point there
 JBM: he's the one to push those quests forward
 pb4: meh
 pb4: The point isn't that good
 AntiSquid: aren't bulls and cows validators random&#160;??
 reCurse: How is it not
 pb4: because a multi has the crappy ranking system
 reCurse: You either have crap ranks or hardcode
 Astrobytes: On balance tho
 reCurse: Pick your poison
 pb4: Then I prefer hardcode
 AntiSquid: wlesavo 
 pb4: But it's Illedan's choice&#160;:)
 reCurse: You could even ab... use the submit system
 reCurse: Make it a 4 player multi
 reCurse: Even better rankings
 pb4: Now I'm curious
 reCurse: And then you can also see others racing
 reCurse: Like I dunno what more to say
 reCurse: Optims suck? :P
 Illedan: Optim multi? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: no collision&#160;?
 reCurse: Of course no collision
 reCurse: Wouldn't be an optim
 struct: I see 1 problem
 struct: 4 players = 150 turns per player
 Illedan: ^
 reCurse: Simplify races
 reCurse: Does it need to be 3 laps
 AntiSquid: 3 players
 Astrobytes: Hmmm
 struct: Or allow multiple actions
 Illedan: But it would be very equal to CSB :P
 struct: you need sim anyways
 reCurse: Equal to CSB wood whatever league yes
 JBM: sim's not real AI
 reCurse: Isn't that your game
 Illedan: yeye
 Illedan: point
 AntiSquid: downvote and reject :thinking:
 reCurse: beluga denied
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: maybe it would be better to just split pre-gold CSB and the rest into two games, also avoid confusion for new players
 wlesavo: they are AntiSquid 
 reCurse: A new code
 reCurse: Coders strike back
 wlesavo: that reminds me actually
 reCurse: Return of the code
 AntiSquid: see what i mean? Illedan if bulls and cows has random validators, why not make yours the same? 20 validators and random&#160;?
 AntiSquid: you can make the checkpoints symmetrical or shift them ... randomize that aspect at least
 reCurse: The checkpoints are now pods with collision and no thrust
 AntiSquid: pinball&#160;?
 reCurse: And 0.1 mass
 reCurse: Because f you
 wlesavo: check point possition generated every turn at random
 Illedan: How to know where to go? :P
 reCurse: Check their ID
 reCurse: Or is it their index
 reCurse: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: you must use index for some things and ID for others. To keep things inconsistent.
 reCurse: Your pod have a line of sight radius of 1000
 reCurse: Shield makes you blind for 3 turns
 reCurse: Boost now leaves a lantern behind with 2k sight
 Astrobytes: Colliding with lanterns resumes blindness and gives you a time penalty
 AntiSquid: + you can build towers on the checkpoints
 Illedan: DOUBLE HULK for extra mass
 wlesavo: and planting mines is important
 reCurse: Checkpoints are now secured and require solving a captcha consisting of number shifting
 Astrobytes: Number shiftin the combination you just found from a bulls and cows problem
 Astrobytes: *shifting
 reCurse: The python bot has still not managed to cross the first checkpoint
 reCurse: Illedan breaker of codingame confirmed
 Illedan: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: Ok, updated the statement :P
 skdm: Hi everyone, I'm newcommer some advice
 Astrobytes: Run! Run away!
 Astrobytes: But seriously, what's your issue
 skdm: Haha
 struct: You must start with Yinsh ritual
 Astrobytes: Stop scaring people struct
 skdm: I don't understand the methodology for learn
 AntiSquid: always drink enough water to stay hydrated skdm
 reCurse: You stare at text really hard
 Astrobytes: And hope you absorb the meaning
 skdm: :wink:
 wlesavo: but you dont absorb if you hydrated 
 AntiSquid: i have a weird question though, does MCTS work better for mars lander?
 AntiSquid: better than GA i mean
 reCurse: Only one way to find out
 struct: I never tried any method of those
 Illedan: Fixed all your comments reCurse :P
 struct: neither ML
 struct: So cant hellp
 Astrobytes: I don't know of anyone who tried MCTS o nthat
 Astrobytes: Give it a shot
 reCurse: All?
 reCurse: 0 degree is still not saying it's pointing at (1,0)
 reCurse: And still no clue of clockwise or counterclockwise
 Illedan: Angle are provided in degrees, and relative to the x axis. 
 reCurse: That answers neither of those question
 Astrobytes: relative to x-axis CCW or CW?
 reCurse: relative to x-axis doesn't mean anything though
 wlesavo: -18 &lt;= angle &lt;= 18
 wlesavo: is it a typo?
 Astrobytes: Hm true
 Illedan: hm?
 Scarfield: east 0 deg, south 90 deg or something from CSB iirc
 wlesavo: Illedan shouldnt it be -180 &lt;= angle &lt;= 180
 Illedan: No that is the rotation in Expert mode
 Illedan: but I guess expert mode users don't look at that
 Illedan: I'll change it to 0-360
 wlesavo: oh i see
 Illedan: Angle are provided in degrees, and relative to the x axis (0 degrees are pointing at (1.0). East = 0 degrees, South = 90 degrees.
 Illedan: Good enough?
 struct: Should I add a toggle to show legal moves on viewer?
 Scarfield: :thinking: how would a pedantic person understand this :p
 struct: Like it would show viewing wise
 Illedan: -.-
 Scarfield: but its clear to me&#160;:)
 reCurse: Yeah it's btter
 Illedan: Updated
 Astrobytes: Pod at 0 degrees is pointing in + direction across the x-axis, and rotates CW, pedantic enough Scarfield?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: hmm is it the pods temperature :p
 Astrobytes: Go away :P
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: My yinsh folder is gone
 struct: wtf
 Astrobytes: Diminyinshing folders
 Scarfield: dont d-yinsh it 
 DragonJ: Direction matches variable XD
 struct: This is just java doing what it should
 Astrobytes: Taking ages/failing?
 Scarfield: self terminate?
 struct: yes scarfield
 reCurse: struct now deletes code instead of account
 Astrobytes: Right, so can we approve this Illedan? I messaged TBali re. the Pascal issue on the forum as he was active, but no response 
 Scarfield: you have backup i hope?
 Illedan: I think the problem in Pascal is on CG side
 struct: "I accept this contrubution because..."
 Illedan: But I don't know anything about Pascal
 Illedan: But yeah, I think it's ready&#160;:)
 Scarfield: Force / Area
 Astrobytes: Alright. If I approve, any problems subsequently are categorically Your Fault.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: "Approved, creator said he thinks its ready" :D
 struct: I can aprove and remove comment
 reCurse: Approved with bribery
 Illedan: :gun:
 Astrobytes: I approve this contribution because: "Illedan made me
 Scarfield: xD
 Illedan: Good boy
 Illedan: struct removed his approve&#160;:/
 struct: I was trying to exploit 
 struct: it
 struct: But I think they fixed it
 Astrobytes: Approve or delete account struct
 DragonJ: angler=left 
 DragonJ: angler=up
 Scarfield: give this man a stick, and he will find an exploit with it
 Illedan: And if he can't exploid. Delete
 Astrobytes: Exploid? Exploiting or exploding?
 reCurse: Why not both
 Illedan: In 10 years when people are looking at this question. They will understand nothing of the approval process :D
 reCurse: Process?
 Illedan: struct had 3 approved comments..
 struct: "You cannot submit more than 3 comments per minute".
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: lol, dat approval system
 Illedan: 1 to go
 Astrobytes: reCurse is just making you wait
 Illedan: Live now :tada:
 Astrobytes: lol, gg Scarfieldatron
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Illedan: 1st :tada:
 Scarfield: wait, you were paid struct? i need to see the manager!
 Astrobytes: nyah nyah Illedan
 Illedan: reCurse will own us :o
 Astrobytes: ofc
 struct: add picture
 Illedan: Now we can share replays too :tada:
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Now a user commented something about the statement
 Illedan: I guess I can fix that
 struct: lol
 Scarfield: illedan does your bot still contain:
 Scarfield: 
 Illedan: Yeh
 Scarfield: nice :D
 Illedan: For now it is your bot :P
 Scarfield: yea could see our scores, but hoped you hadnt noticed it :p

 Astrobytes: YurkovAS rekt us all :D
 RoboStac: so apparently the racer scoring I use on my csb bot isn't enough to do one lap
 RoboStac: luckily it's easy to fix&#160;:)
 YurkovAS: :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: lol, here it comes
 struct: I dont know whats my bug
 struct: My car just is dumb and stay 1mm away from cp

 RoboStac: yeah, thats exactly what mine did struct - the bonus for getting a checkpoint wasn't enough to counter going through a checkpoint so it just stayed at the edge
 struct: I see
 struct: let me increase
 Snef: Astrobytes why&#160;?&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, was earlier when I stole your 1st position. We have all been subsequently rekt :P
 Illedan: RoboStac, can you share a replay of TokyoDrift from your bot?

 Illedan: Only 3 angles and 2 speeds?
 Illedan: I like the enemy prediction message you have :D
 Astrobytes: All you need
 RoboStac: it should be able to do 9 degree angles too
 Astrobytes: I come back later this week with my search, for now I'm off to bed
 Astrobytes: gn all, and thanks for finishing SR Illedan, and congrats to you struct, Yinsh Day has come
 Scarfield: :wave:
 Illedan: gn
 Illedan: Thx for accepting under pressure

 Illedan: nice
 Scarfield: a little too nice :p
 struct: I need to fix my code though
 Illedan: not 100%?
 struct: But I need to finish yinsh first
 struct: Nope
 struct: not even close
 struct: I get like 85
 Illedan: wierd
 Illedan: timeouts?
 struct: nope
 Illedan: Any of the testcases?
 struct: It just kisses the checkpoint
 Illedan: ah
 struct: Its random
 DragonJ: my CSB code as current if dist&gt;1000 thrust=="BOOST"
 DragonJ: plan on fixing my dead code but it still doing well considering
 Illedan: reCurse, is that your NN trained for CSB? Or did you train it for this game?
 reCurse: Trained it for this game with the previous mapgen
 reCurse: 0.01ms spent per turn
 reCurse: Might bother adding search one day
 reCurse: I totally predict pb4 to annoy me with his high score :P
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Don't need a search to predict that
 dev-nekoboi: the existence of python is unfair for clash of code&#160;;-;
 eeeeeeeelias: a little bit
 eeeeeeeelias: the existence of ruby is unfair for shortest mode though
 dev-nekoboi: yeh
 dev-nekoboi: *cries softly*
 dev-nekoboi: lmao

 reCurse: Existence is unfair
 cegprakash: wait I'm #46 in pacman 
 cegprakash: :O
 Illedan: Play search race cegprakash
 Illedan: Should be ezpz to stream to 1st&#160;;)
 Snef: Illedan i took my csb code pour search race but it doesnt want to go more than 1 cp&#160;:(
 Snef: for*
 Illedan: Only 1 car in this one, it misses his friend
 Snef: yea i changed num of pods and shield, timeout, collision with pods... but i dk i need to check again..
 reCurse: Meh alright might add some search
 reCurse: Just curious if it changes much

 Snef: reCurse will you have much more time for seach compared to csb&#160;? or it's almost same
 reCurse: Less, 50ms instead of 75
 reCurse: But more, 1 pod instead of 4
 Snef: and 1 pod == 1 pod in csb&#160;?
 Illedan: Network smaller?
 reCurse: shrug
 cegprakash: I won't try anymore bitrunner from u Illedan
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: it was a stream flop
 Illedan: Search race is simple
 Illedan: Stream -3 vel
 cegprakash: haha
 Illedan: My current score is 2 ifs
 Illedan: *1 if 1 else
 cegprakash: will do tomorrow
 cegprakash: I'm watching avengers
 DragonJ: snef am looking through your code where do you use deltaX and deltaY?
 Snef: through my code&#160;?
 DragonJ: yeah
 Snef: what code
 DragonJ: In CSB what should I do with deltaX and deltaY?
 Uljahn: looks like vx, vy of the velocity vector so you could plug them in the magic formula -3Vel
 Uljahn: but it's just my guess
 Jasperr: did -3 vel and some additional thrusting magic and am now 4th place :D
 Jasperr: Thanks for the tip Illedan

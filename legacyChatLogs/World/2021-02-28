 ThornFlynt: else: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a656fba-f5e1-496e-90f6-c72bf619db31">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a656fba-f5e1-496e-90f6-c72bf619db31</a>
 ThornFlynt: for some reason this code isn't making it to the last elif... variable declared outside of nested if and inside game loop...
 ThornFlynt: Failure: Thor wandered off the path and died (invalid position).Thor position = (4,18). Light position = (0,17). Energy = 18
 ThornFlynt: even tho he shouldn't have made it a y position of 18&#160;:-\
 ThornFlynt: Nevermind - forgot to set the thor_x/y variables to update themselves
 TonyAustin: how do I race the 2nd boss? I have been watching races in the arena for 5 minutes now and I am winning pretty much every one. Am I supposed to do something to start the boss race?
 CHT-DAT: Hello
 srinivasTheDeveloper: any lonely developers?
 FalconX: i am one
 srinivasTheDeveloper: nice to meet you
 CHT-DAT: Hi there
 XiaoDa: Hello world
 AutomationBoi: x y "BOOST" is giving exception as expected x y power
 AutomationBoi: any one has any idea?
 TonyAustin: are you printing number space number space number?
 AutomationBoi:  no no i am printing
 AutomationBoi: one sec
 AutomationBoi: xcordinate ycoordinate 100
 AutomationBoi: yeah its number number number
 AutomationBoi: but when i replace 100 with "BOOST" it gets into exception
 AutomationBoi: I think i am not using boost correctly
 TonyAustin: is boost your variable? don't put it in quotation marks if so
 AutomationBoi:  no boost is the keyword here
 AutomationBoi: x y "BOOST" is giving exception as expected x y powerany one has any idea?
 AutomationBoi: Once per race you may substitute your desired thrust with the keyword BOOST to grant your pod a burst of speed.
 creeperZnation4: It's just a string you print instead of the thrust value, right?
 AutomationBoi: correct
 FalconX: what's your real name
 AutomationBoi: hence i am printing it with double quotes... not sure where is the miss here
 AutomationBoi: its resolved now
 AutomationBoi: thanks the chat pointed me to right direction
 Manhar: for i in range(inf):print("I love You);
 VasanthanPT: How to join shortest mode in clash of code?
 blackjune: randomly
 LaZeta: Or use a private clash for a specific mode
 bro_momentum: are the first few leagues in coders strike back bots
 bro_momentum: as oppose to actual people
 TonyAustin: nah bro, I am in your league atm bro_momentum
 TonyAustin: how did you crush so ahrd tho? lol
 bro_momentum: uh
 bro_momentum: idk
 bro_momentum: i just wrote code
 TonyAustin: like what was your strategy though? 
 bro_momentum: uh
 bro_momentum: well
 creeperZnation4: Is there a strategy? I just assumed that having the best control gave you the maximum speed
 bro_momentum: i only use boost if the angle difference is less than or equal to 30 or greater than or equal to negative 30
 bro_momentum: to insure that boost maximizes effectiveness by activating when i need to go in a straight line
 MdAshfaqulHaque: umm.Hello there&#160;:)
 TonyAustin: I did the same but for less than 2 or more than -2 ._. 30 is a lot
 TonyAustin: but what do I know, I been stuck in this league xD
 bro_momentum: im at the top and nothing is happening
 bro_momentum: how do i move on
 creeperZnation4: don't u beat the boss?
 bro_momentum: did that
 creeperZnation4: idk then lol XD
 creeperZnation4: what league?
 bro_momentum: wood 1
 bro_momentum: i think
 TonyAustin: if you check the leaderboard it will tell you your score, and your score has to be higher than the league boss's score
 bro_momentum: im at the top
 creeperZnation4: Yeah u just play the arena and the boss
 bro_momentum: my rank is 1 the boss is below me
 creeperZnation4: u just kind of get promoted after a while
 Theino: it'll upgrade you when it finishes calibrating you
 bro_momentum: how long does that usually take?
 creeperZnation4: Not long... like I got promoted after like 5 minutes
 TonyAustin: I think my bot is retarded? how do I fix
 Theino: a few minutes. Several minutes when its slow
 bro_momentum: interesting
 bro_momentum: ok now i did
 creeperZnation4: a retarded bot XD
 bro_momentum: it promoted instantly last time so i was confused
 TonyAustin: my bot literally will go through the correct area, and then try to turn around and go back to it, then half way on the way back it will swap to the next checkpoint
 bro_momentum: lol what is ur code
 creeperZnation4: I kind of wanna see that XD
 bro_momentum: can you paste a bit of your code
 bro_momentum: im curious as to why it would be doing that
 TonyAustin: here, I will show you an example of my bot racing, I am actually convinced that it is retarded. 
 TonyAustin: I want to find a good example so gimme a sec
 bro_momentum: idk how the hell to solve the collision problem
 TonyAustin: alright, I found a horrid example
 TonyAustin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/531301935">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/531301935</a>
 TonyAustin: as you can see with the line showing where it is turning too, it will still try to go to the one it already passed for a bit then suddenly change to the next checkpoint
 creeperZnation4: I see the problem now...
 bro_momentum: it never stopped half way
 creeperZnation4: You see the yellow light next to the checkpoint?
 bro_momentum: it missed checkpoint 1
 bro_momentum: at one point
 creeperZnation4: Yeah
 bro_momentum: it touched the sprite but missed the hitbox
 bro_momentum: and went back to touch it again
 TonyAustin: like when it finishes first lap is a good example
 creeperZnation4: Here's a fix: slow down when u get close to the checkpoint
 creeperZnation4: like thrust = 0 or something when you get reasonably close
 TonyAustin: alright, also check at prame 93, the light is on checkpoint 1 but for some reason it is still heading to checkpoint 0 lol
 bro_momentum: what are your angle limits set to that make your thrust lower
 TonyAustin: Here is one of them: thrust = ((100 * next_checkpoint_x / x) + (100 * next_checkpoint_y / y)) / 2 
 TonyAustin: And I have this one too: if (next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 0)&#160;:
 TonyAustin: then I add 10 thrust to keep it capped at 100 when the bot is far away from checkpoint
 bro_momentum: I'm not doing it that way at all
 bro_momentum: I'm using if statements lol
 TonyAustin: I assumed so lol
 bro_momentum: too lazy for math
 TonyAustin: I would scrap my 60 lines of if statements and stupid math, but they are all working to make the bot go as fast as I can get it lol
 MdAshfaqulHaque: lol I'm first&#160;:)
 TonyAustin: I might just be too stupid for this racing game
 bro_momentum: 60 lines?
 bro_momentum: ur trying too hyard
 creeperZnation4: 60 lines?! I think there are like less than 15 in mine
 bro_momentum: ^
 MdAshfaqulHaque: what is hyard,lol?
 bro_momentum: *hard
 MdAshfaqulHaque: :D
 TonyAustin: ._.
 creeperZnation4: Does anyone know what "coding speed" is lol XD
 MdAshfaqulHaque: no,then tell
 creeperZnation4: I'm asking because I don't know either :sweat_smile:
 MdAshfaqulHaque: lool
 MdAshfaqulHaque: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 bro_momentum: not sure how this magnitude will do because ive yet to try it out and see how much a positional unit is, but do you think this is an okay solution to collision&gt;
 bro_momentum:&#160;?
 bro_momentum: if (Math.abs(x - opponentX) &lt; 30 &amp;&amp; Math.abs(x - opponentX) &lt; 30) thrust = 50;
 creeperZnation4: So you're trying to slow down?
 TonyAustin: I am clearly in the wrong profession, cause I have no clue what that will do lol
 creeperZnation4: If you used shields it would make your player harder to move
 TonyAustin: wait is that the same expression twice?
 creeperZnation4: so replace thrust = 50 with thrust = "SHIELD" and you should be fine
 creeperZnation4: yeah wait lol XD
 TonyAustin: both sides of the &amp;&amp; say "Math.abs(x - opponentX) &lt; 30
 TonyAustin: "
 creeperZnation4: I think he meant to replace the 2nd set with y and opponentY
 bro_momentum: oh yeah whoops
 bro_momentum: what creeper said
 bro_momentum: i dont have access to SHIELD yet
 bro_momentum: collisions just got introduced
 creeperZnation4: really?
 bro_momentum: yeah
 bro_momentum: collisions are on but they didnt give me any new powers
 TonyAustin: I just wanna beat wood 1 league so I can quit playing this dumb minigame D:
 bro_momentum: just gonna have to do with this
 creeperZnation4: Oh I guess you'll get them in the next league XD
 jacek: oO
 creeperZnation4: yeah, try ur best with that I guess... I just kind of brute-forced my way through so XD
 TonyAustin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/531304916">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/531304916</a>
 TonyAustin: I am clearly doing smth wrong
 TonyAustin: how is my bot so dumb
 bro_momentum: idk
 jacek: you copied your brain into him
 bro_momentum: ^^
 TonyAustin: ^
 creeperZnation4: You're going like an extra couple units extra after each unit
 creeperZnation4: more than the bot at least
 TonyAustin: I wrote a neural network and referenced it off of my own brain and decision making
 creeperZnation4: Wait lol I just got the joke XD
 TonyAustin: no but for real I don't know how to fix this, pls send help
 TonyAustin: I literally commented out all of my code except the basic thrust and it still does it
 creeperZnation4: slow down at the checkpoints
 creeperZnation4: The more efficiently you do that, the faster you will be
 bro_momentum: which you will basically be implemented if you add angle checks
 bro_momentum: and slow down for too high angles
 creeperZnation4: yeah
 creeperZnation4: ^
 TonyAustin: OH
 TonyAustin: I am stupid
 TonyAustin: "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 TonyAustin: that is why is is not swapping to the next checkpoint instantly lmaooo
 creeperZnation4: oh XD
 creeperZnation4: The boss is learning tho
 creeperZnation4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/531305689">https://www.codingame.com/replay/531305689</a>
 creeperZnation4: I thought I was going to win there XD
 TonyAustin: wait wtf
 creeperZnation4: Something still wrong?
 TonyAustin: I reset to the default code and it is still giving me the error
 creeperZnation4: You would think it's a system problem at that point, but it doesn't appear that anyone else if facing it
 creeperZnation4: How's your internet XD
 MdAshfaqulHaque: boss is always BOSS
 TonyAustin: pretty bad ngl, but its the best possible internet we can buy in our area ._.
 bro_momentum: my bot almost always boosts in the beginning of the game lol
 creeperZnation4: Mine only boosts if there's a 7000+ distance between goals
 creeperZnation4: but that might change soon XD
 creeperZnation4: TonyAustin u might wanna try later then I guess
 bro_momentum: how much is 700
 bro_momentum: 7000*
 bro_momentum: like half the map?
 creeperZnation4: more or less yeah
 creeperZnation4: I tried printing out the distances once
 TonyAustin: there is a little thing on the right that shows 1000 distance
 bro_momentum: it errors
 bro_momentum: which is annoying
 TonyAustin: the screen from left to right is 16000
 creeperZnation4: Oh I must've missed that XD
 creeperZnation4: erorrs?
 TonyAustin: I just do math with the center of the screen i.e. 8000,4500
 bro_momentum: bro i cant even advance even tho im shatter everyone
 bro_momentum: ok made it to #5
 bro_momentum: shattering*
 zzvcc: whats up gamers
 TonyAustin: PAIN
 bro_momentum: suo
 bro_momentum: sup*
 bro_momentum: time to pythagorean theorem
 TonyAustin: ah yes, e=mc^2
 creeperZnation4: XD
 bro_momentum: no it's y=mx+b
 TonyAustin: hmm, that can't be right. I could have sworn it was 9.8m/s^2
 creeperZnation4: gonna have to argue that it's (b (+ or -) √(b^2 - 2(a)(c))) / 2a
 bro_momentum: no it's –a=ΔvΔt=vf−v0tf−t0
 creeperZnation4: Are you sure? I learned that it was x = x0 + 0.5(v - v0)t
 bro_momentum: bro do u even physics bro
 bro_momentum: everyone knows its dU=δQ−δW
 creeperZnation4: Ok look I started Physics like this year I don't even know what I'm looking at rn XD
 TonyAustin: I'm over here with highschool physics in my pocket not knowing what tf yall bringing up
 bro_momentum: I'm over here in 8th grade watching too much khan academy
 creeperZnation4: lol XD
 creeperZnation4: it's always khan academy, isn't it XD
 bro_momentum: undisputed king of education
 bro_momentum: we should go to school and sit down and do khan academy
 bro_momentum: and it would be 50x better than the current garbage system
 creeperZnation4: Ah ok I was looking at the first law of thermodynamics XD
 creeperZnation4: lol the world would become 25% smarter XD
 creeperZnation4: And then we could get wifi to those who don't have it and increase that number
 bro_momentum: qunatum internet
 bro_momentum: ah
 bro_momentum: qunatum
 bro_momentum: quantum internet
 creeperZnation4: Ah yes, qunatum entanglement... my favorite XD
 bro_momentum: hey creeper
 creeperZnation4: yeah?
 bro_momentum: whats ur code for distance detection for boosting
 TonyAustin: yo, can I get a cheat sheet to beat wood league 1 lol
 bro_momentum: mine is
 bro_momentum: uh
 bro_momentum: get good
 TonyAustin: I am too dumb to beat it
 TonyAustin: D:
 bro_momentum: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47783172-e1a2-4fa8-a0c4-8e3d3dcb8df1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47783172-e1a2-4fa8-a0c4-8e3d3dcb8df1</a>
 creeperZnation4: My code is really simple lol XD
 bro_momentum: look at my code tell me if its good enough
 bro_momentum: what languages you guys using btw
 TonyAustin: python, but I can swap easily. I just like python ngl
 creeperZnation4: I didn't even use Pythagoreans theorem, but the other part is basically what I did
 creeperZnation4: so in theory it should work better than mine
 creeperZnation4: Since you're actually calculating the shortest path
 MadKnight: bro_momentum don't u already have a variable for the distance&#160;?
 MadKnight: given&#160;?
 creeperZnation4: Yeah, I just used the one they gave us
 TonyAustin: ^
 bro_momentum: oh wait lmao
 bro_momentum: big brain
 bro_momentum: once i make it to bronze league 2 finally im going to be4d
 bro_momentum: bed
 bro_momentum: its 3:30 am
 creeperZnation4: Lol it's 4:30 for me 
 creeperZnation4: I said I would sleep 4 hours ago
 bro_momentum: ok with this new boost check im slaughtering
 bro_momentum: and still going down ranks cmon people stop winning
 bro_momentum: it punishes me for nothing
 bro_momentum: just stop playing altogether
 creeperZnation4: that would help XD
 bro_momentum: alr rank 5
 creeperZnation4: Ooh
 creeperZnation4: so close
 creeperZnation4: or is that enough idk
 MadKnight: no u gotta be above the boss 
 MadKnight: if the boss is somehow below 5 then that's enough
 creeperZnation4: Oh so that's how it works... I've ascended leagues (or whatever the expression is) without being first before, so I wasn't sure
 bro_momentum: sometimes u ascend before the leaderboard updates if it registers fast
 bro_momentum: so maybe thats why
 creeperZnation4: Yeah I guess so
 bro_momentum: bruteforcing this league is soooo hard
 bro_momentum: not sure how u did it creeper
 creeperZnation4: idk I just played and it worked XD
 creeperZnation4: I started yesterday night btw, so I don't really know what I'm doing XD
 MadKnight: when someone submits and gets games against u it might affect your rank
 MadKnight: bro_momentum just subtract your velocity vector from checkpoint 
 bro_momentum: what
 creeperZnation4: We have a velocity vector?
 MadKnight: nop u gotta calculate it
 MadKnight: but it's easy
 creeperZnation4: Ah ok
 bro_momentum: wait how does that help
 bro_momentum: subtracting my velocity from nextCheckpointDist or something like that?
 MadKnight: no lol not from the distance
 bro_momentum: from what
 MadKnight: from the xy of checkpoint
 bro_momentum: what would that give me
 MadKnight: your pod would stop overshooting checkpoints
 bro_momentum: ohhh
 bro_momentum: i get what u mean now
 bro_momentum: like subtract my velocity from the nextCheckpoint values inside of my print that tells the pod where to go
 bro_momentum: thank you
 bro_momentum: am i right?
 MadKnight: yea
 bro_momentum: how do i calculate velocity lmao
 bro_momentum: i mean i know how you would typically
 bro_momentum: but i dont exactly have a time counter
 bro_momentum: so how do i calculate it
 MadKnight: your time counter is the tick counter
 MadKnight: turn counter
 bro_momentum: ok so a turn is 75s
 bro_momentum: ms
 MadKnight: no
 MadKnight: yes but no
 bro_momentum: its under that
 bro_momentum: or equal to
 MadKnight: a turn is 1 step
 bro_momentum: uh huh
 MadKnight: so your speed goes in pixels/turn
 MadKnight: and time goes in turns
 bro_momentum: but how i access the turns
 bro_momentum: do i*
 MadKnight: u got a while(true)
 MadKnight: every iteration is a turn
 bro_momentum: correct
 MadKnight: so just use it
 bro_momentum: but dont i need a counter
 bro_momentum: and i cant make one on my own
 MadKnight: u need to count what exactly&#160;?
 MadKnight: for velocity
 bro_momentum: i mean i need to know how many turns goes into a specific amount of movement
 MadKnight: depends on the movement
 bro_momentum: i can't make something that counts the turns to the next checkpoint
 bro_momentum: and divide
 MadKnight: dude
 MadKnight: how is that related to your current velocity
 bro_momentum: cuz its distance per a unit of time
 MadKnight: and what distance exactly&#160;?
 bro_momentum: wdym
 MadKnight: which distance&#160;?
 MadKnight: in this case
 bro_momentum: idk distance to the next checkpoint?
 bro_momentum: idk what ur playing at
 MadKnight: u gonna calculate pod's velocity by dividing its distance to a random object in the world by time&#160;?
 bro_momentum: no obviously not
 MadKnight: then what distance are u gonna use&#160;?
 bro_momentum: checkpoint distance
 bro_momentum: obviously
 bro_momentum: that was a stupid question to ask
 bro_momentum: which is why it confused me
 MadKnight: checkpoint IS a random object in the world
 MadKnight: u just said u weren't gonna use that
 bro_momentum: well yeah i suppose
 bro_momentum: its not random in the context of random im thinking about
 MadKnight: it's random in the context of calculating pod's velocity
 bro_momentum: well its measurable
 bro_momentum: i mean my thought process was
 bro_momentum: if i can figure out how many turns go into getting to a checkpoint
 bro_momentum: i can divide into 1 turn
 bro_momentum: and see how far that takes me
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: u just calculated x from using x to calculate x
 MadKnight: gg
 bro_momentum: what
 bro_momentum: look
 bro_momentum: last time i checked
 bro_momentum: velocity is displacement over time
 MadKnight: yep
 bro_momentum: i measurable displacement is checkpoint distance
 bro_momentum: and then i can see how much time that takes
 bro_momentum: a measurable*
 bro_momentum: then my dilemma was that i cant actually see how much time that takes
 xspeedasx: displacement is distance between your last coords to current coords
 MadKnight: well it could work if your pod was moving EXACTLY directly to checkpoint center
 bro_momentum: true
 bro_momentum: ok but no matter
 bro_momentum: what distance i use
 bro_momentum: there is still the dilemma that idk how the measure the time
 bro_momentum: because if i try to make a turn counter which i tried before
 bro_momentum: codingame yells at me
 MadKnight: dude u don't need neither of those
 MadKnight: xspeedasx just said what distance to use
 bro_momentum: yes that is the distance
 MadKnight: &gt; distance between your last coords to current coordsdivided by the time between last turn and now which == 1
 MadKnight: so basically it's just x - prevX
 MadKnight: divided by 1
 bro_momentum: oh i suppose so
 bro_momentum: ok then lmao
 bro_momentum: look idk what time it is for you
 bro_momentum: but for me its 4 am
 bro_momentum: and my brain gets like exponentially slower as soon as it hits like
 bro_momentum: 2:30 am
 bro_momentum: so rn im basically stoned
 bro_momentum: anyways goodnight
 MadKnight: gn
 MadKnight: xspeedasx what about u&#160;?
 MadKnight: did u implement that&#160;?
 xspeedasx: i dont rememeber :D
 MadKnight: u should do it xspeedasx
 xspeedasx: i did some GA anad it got me 100th place or so
 xspeedasx: 894th now lol
 MadKnight: what league&#160;?
 xspeedasx: legend
 xspeedasx: 4 years ago
 MadKnight: gg
 MadKnight: improve your GA
 MadKnight: it should be able to reach top 100 now easy
 xspeedasx: just checked, it seems that something changed with CSB engine, my app doesnt work anymore :D
 MadKnight: 75ms/turn now
 MadKnight: instead of 150
 xspeedasx: ok fixed, now it will drop out probably :D it only does 5 generations now
 MadKnight: lol why so? are u using python or something
 xspeedasx: c#
 MadKnight: what's the size of a generation&#160;?
 MadKnight: what depth&#160;?
 xspeedasx: hm generatioon was 500 and 8 turns  deep. Should probably tweak these, since there's not a lot of time to evolve them anymore
 MadKnight: 500 is really much, try 50
 xspeedasx: :thumbsup:

 MSmits: and that's with simple boardgames. Now try simming one of those old contests&#160;:)
 MSmits: I recommend kutulu
 Suleyman_Brnabar: Hello everyone! Does anyone know why I cant see solutions in contributions and also I cant approve or reject them? I have more than 50 games.
 Uljahn: private clashes don't count
 Qajari_Aspet: no, they are not private
 Uljahn: 50 clashes are required to approve clashes only, for puzzles you need 20 lvl i guess

 Wontonimo: UnnamedCodinGamer Thanks for the link to your MCTS writeup.  Do you usually keep track of win/loss/tie all separately?  I'm asking because I usually just keep 1 float, add 1 if win, add 0.5 if tie.  What are you thoughts on the difference?
 jacek: he also keeps the uctvalue
 jacek: normally i keep just score and visits
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Wontonimo
 jacek: and terminal
 Wontonimo: Hi UnnamedCodinGamer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, the first implementation kept track only of victories
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and drwaw was +0.5, as you mention
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I added draws and losses  later to be more visible 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: now you can see better all results of the rollouts
 Wontonimo: switching to int math has been nagging at me for weeks, because floats have less significant digits and addition of floats isn't as clean as int addition
 Wontonimo: did you find that ^ sort of thing changed with an int win/loss count
 jacek: welp if you use -1 0 1 then you can use it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: jacek, yes
 Wontonimo: jacek -1 0 1 doesn't give you an insight into the difference between 2 tie games and 1win/1loss
 jacek: :shrug:
 Wontonimo: (but i'm not convinced it really matters)
 Wontonimo: ^
 Wontonimo: jacek, do you use ints or floats for your totalReward&#160;?
 jacek: for pure mcts ints
 Wontonimo: thanks.  that may be why i've seen a few others also say they use -1 0 1 instead of 1 .5 0.  This will be a nice experiment

 icecream17: oh wow, every language i searched up is outdated. (I only searched 4 though)
 Katespizer: like newest node lts version was released like 4 months ago 
 Katespizer: give 'em some time
 MasterCoderxD: what's the excuse for python then? Katespizer?
 Katespizer: i don't know 
 Wontonimo: and when's the last time you published code into a real production environment with no less than 10 servers using the latest version of a language?  Me?  Never, always at least 1 year behind.
 MasterCoderxD: hackerrank
 Katespizer: picking lts is good way to think about it
 struct: hackerrank doesnt have arenas with bots right?
 struct: if you update a language you might break bots code
 icecream17: maybe it can be an opt-in, though that's more complicated
 Katespizer: struct, then we really can't update the language? Like, never?
 struct: they do get updated
 struct: But they dont update it very often
 Katespizer: then why say "if you update a language you might break bots code"
 Katespizer: when we are just doing it 
 AntiSquid: but we did have language updates that broke some bots :D
 Katespizer: i don't understand, like, do bots really write a code? 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 struct: you can write AI to play a game
 struct: When you submit the bot stays in the arena
 Katespizer: now i get it 
 jacek: :soccer:
 AntiSquid: maybe i should give the paper soccer a serious try 
 Wontonimo: I see a tool <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441</a> that allows your to rename your code submit to "test in arena".  Does that still work and can you do it without the tool?
 struct: I think the renaming still works
 struct: not sure if there is any other script that does it
 jacek: i already have test in arena, i dont have the tool
 tutubalin: i made a puzzle, but some people say they cannot see Unicode characters
 tutubalin: could you please take a look and tell me is it ok for you or not?
 tutubalin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6351e335f78e8bd9b9c7cf78f1b51d847b0b">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6351e335f78e8bd9b9c7cf78f1b51d847b0b</a>
 jacek: i see
 Astrobytes: tutubalin: I can't see them. Isn't there some guidelines on unicode? In the forum I think.
 jacek: im using chromium on linux
 tutubalin: Astrobytes which browser do you use?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/6EMM7VK.png">https://i.imgur.com/6EMM7VK.png</a>
 Astrobytes: tutubalin: chrome on windows currently, didn't test in other browsers yet
 tutubalin: Astrobytes weird. i also use chrome on windows
 Passifi: my chrome on windows displays them fine
 jacek: no fonts?
 Astrobytes: Possible. Works fine in FF
 Astrobytes: Not working in Opera
 tutubalin: Astrobytes guidlines do not recommend Unicode as input/output. couldn't find any restrictions on using it in problem statement
 tutubalin: is it possible to include an image in statement?
 jacek: unicode as input *_*
 jacek: link it
 Astrobytes: Yeah has to be a link
 tutubalin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/how-to-make-coc-puzzle-with-unicode-characters/188910">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/how-to-make-coc-puzzle-with-unicode-characters/188910</a>
 Astrobytes: ah yes
 struct: This is what i needed
 struct: Now Ill give amazons boards as unicode chars
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: since what time referee counts time?
 struct: What do you mean jacek?
 jacek: input reading takes 35-50 ms
 struct: where?
 Astrobytes: on Amazons?
 jacek: chess
 Astrobytes: oh
 jacek: then i do stuff for 20-25ms its ok
 Astrobytes: sure?
 jacek: but when i use over 35ms then its sometimes timeout
 struct: do you get moves list?
 jacek: no
 struct: I dont see anything wrong on the referee

 dericeketli: hello
 dericeketli: gençler
 Astrobytes: Are you getting spikes in the elapsed time jacek?
 jacek: within 5-15 ms
 Astrobytes: starting timer after cin &gt;&gt; board &gt;&gt; etc?
 jacek: only the cins sometimes take 70ms
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b344e1f7-4dfe-4da0-8897-7262a3f3a4e2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b344e1f7-4dfe-4da0-8897-7262a3f3a4e2</a>
 jacek: duration = 70ms, duration2 (my parsing) = 0ms
 DomiKo: jacek reports has been going on for ages, maybe it's related
 DomiKo: submits* 
 DomiKo: one minute = one game
 jacek: submits are fine
 DomiKo: super slow
 Astrobytes: jacek, what happens if you set the timer to start after cin &gt;&gt; board? As in cin &gt;&gt; board; start_timer();
 bigmazi: isn't "shortest code" mode in clash of code is a bit silly? it basically forces not to use languages which requires mandatory boilerplate
 jacek: duration 0
 jacek: board alone takes that much? its just string line
 jacek: but, is this time counted for player's time?
 Astrobytes: I've split all the cins, started timer after cin &gt;&gt; board; output the times and it's barely even a ms. If I start the timer after all inputs it's 70+ ms sometimes
 jacek: yeah, board alone can take 50ms
 jacek: actually i havent timed other games. do this happen there as well?
 Astrobytes: not sure tbh
 Astrobytes: Clobber seems OK?
 struct: Could it be java garbage collector running while sending input lines?
 jacek: its not that complex is it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/reCurs3/codingame-chess/blob/0010797a3670f7a4b545f852a1f220da234e0835/src/main/java/cc/recursive/chess/Board.java#L176">https://github.com/reCurs3/codingame-chess/blob/0010797a3670f7a4b545f852a1f220da234e0835/src/main/java/cc/recursive/chess/Board.java#L176</a>
 Binary_Sky: do you get anything for making puzzles
 Astrobytes: A chocolate medal and a pat on the back.
 Astrobytes: (XP)
 Astrobytes: But don't just make a puzzle because you want the XP, make a puzzle because you have a good idea for one Binary_Sky
 dericeketli: beyler
 dericeketli: yaptınız mı
 Astrobytes: dericeketli: English in world chat please (not sure if there's a Turkish language channel?)
 Wontonimo: actually the chocolate medal and pat on the back are do-it-yourself prizes
 Astrobytes: lol indeed
 jacek: Astrobytes i checked checkers, input oscillates between 30-70ms
 Astrobytes: Hmmmmm
 dericeketli: alooo
 Binary_Sky: nice, i have no intent on creating puzzles cause im just 15 and getting into coding
 dericeketli: nabiyonuz
 dericeketli: gençler
 dericeketli: No Turkish
 dericeketli: I am speak English
 Astrobytes: What's your question dericeketli?
 dericeketli: ne yapıcan
 dericeketli: kardeş
 dericeketli: Alooo
 dericeketli: duyuyor musun
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 dericeketli: He is a man
 dericeketli: What is the AWS?
 dericeketli: How old are you?
 dericeketli: Where are you from?
 dericeketli: astrobytes
 dericeketli: aloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 Astrobytes: Stop it please. 
 jacek: UwU
 Aka_nate458: No
 dericeketli: adamsın adam
 Astrobytes: dericeketli: Great observation. If you continue talking rubbish you risk a kick from the chat.
 duckymirror: Is my code buggy (it probably is) or does the second player in Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe really get timeouts much faster?
 dericeketli: I'm sorry
 dericeketli: please
 Wontonimo: no, second player doesn't get timeouts any faster
 Astrobytes: bug++
 jacek: oO
 dericeketli: please
 Wontonimo: you get 1000ms for your first move, then 100ms in subsequent moves
 duckymirror: Hmm.
 dericeketli: HMM
 Wontonimo: what language are you using duckymirror&#160;?
 duckymirror: I'm using Rust
 jacek: :scream:
 Wontonimo: i can't help you
 Astrobytes: dericeketli: Do you have anything to ask or say?
 Theino: Rust gets half the time of other languages due to its brittle nature. Get a Tetanus shot to get your full time.
 Wontonimo: are you using a timer at the start of inputs duckymirror&#160;?
 dericeketli: yok abi
 dericeketli: vallla yok
 dericeketli: please
 dericeketli: I'm sorry
 duckymirror: No, I start it after reading the inputs
 duckymirror: I let my program run for 90ms if it's the first player and 70ms if it's the second player
 dericeketli: Astrobytes
 Wontonimo: wow, that's a big gap
 Astrobytes: That should not be a thing
 dericeketli: What is the AWS?
 Astrobytes: AMAZON WEB SERVICES. Use a search engine.
 dericeketli: thanks
 dericeketli: What is the amplify?
 duckymirror: It still times out with 70ms, but it works when it uses 90ms as the first player
 Wontonimo: okay, this may be totally wrong (and please someone jump in and correct me) but it seems to me if your process is just a bit over the 100ms threshold it passes a few times until to total you are over accumulates to too much ... like a 20ms buffer or something
 jacek: dunno about the buffer, but you can try 105ms and sometimes youll get lucky and not timeout
 struct: do you start the timer after reading firs tor last input?
 duckymirror: After reading the last input
 jacek: but sometimes errors are amibguous. it will say 'timeout' but maybe your bot crashed
 struct: you should start it after reading the first input
 Wontonimo: ^
 Astrobytes: try the first input and report back
 duckymirror: Oh, I see, thanks!
 duckymirror: It seems to work now! Thank you again!
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: thanks for asking and test duckymirror , i didn't know that the clock started after the first input
 jonvine: gbfgb
 AntiSquid: english
 Wontonimo: incase anyone is curious, i've tried some tests of dynamically changing C in MCTS, specifically something a bit lower than ideal early game then steadily up to ideal late game.
 Wontonimo: it had negligible effect.
 jacek: *gasp*
 Wontonimo: I know right?
 Wontonimo: the effect i was going for was to explore more deeply early game at the cost of over looking things, but in late game to make sure things are not overlooked (with a regular amount of regret)
 GeorgiD: How do I debug print in python?
 GeorgiD: Because I'm in a clash and I removed the comment
 jacek: print to stderr
 Wontonimo: print("hi", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 GeorgiD: Tnx
 jacek: you can reset in right upper corner of ide
 Wontonimo: fun fact: you can prevent the loss of your work first by using ctrl-c, and then restore it with ctrl-v
 GeorgiD: Yeah xd 
 jacek: oh i pulled down rebless in checkers
 Wontonimo: Goodbye uttt, you have tested me and in the final hours of February I yield.  With more time I may have crush some bot souls by adding NNs, but alas, it wasn't meant to be
 Wontonimo: new month = new challenge!
 jacek: you will never fill the void after uttt
 struct: what are you going to play?
 Wontonimo: i started SprintChallenge way long ago and never got serious about it
 Wontonimo: and i don't like doing a half job, so that may be it
 jacek: sprintchallenge?
 Wontonimo: same with botg
 Wontonimo: *SpringChallenge
 Wontonimo: but i've gotten so many good suggestions ... probably i'll take the first couple days to decide.  what are you focused on struct&#160;?
 struct: nothing atm
 Wontonimo: my short list is: Tron, CSB, FBits, PRC, Ghost, SpringChallenge, and BotG
 Astrobytes: I no longer have a shortlist, it's just a long list
 struct: I need to finish amazons
 struct: Im gonna allow players to choose board colors I guess
 jacek: where
 Astrobytes: I'm lacking motivation again. CG doesn't feel right at the moment.
 struct: In replay
 struct: Similar to what euler did on try angle catch
 Astrobytes: I miss euler&#160;:(
 jacek: chess.. something i thought id train for a day and move on (on friday) and here i am on sunday
 jacek: AutomatonNN do you miss him?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl i am not that good at it
 struct:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: He does.
 jacek: whats up with him
 jacek: too much salt?
 Astrobytes: No reason to be here. I mean it was a bit of a slap in the face for him with all that happened.
 OmerDrk: why I cant solve Rectangle Partition puzzle
 OmerDrk: I am dumb
 Wontonimo: sorry to hear
 struct: Possible one of the people that contributed the most&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: yeah, lots of really cool puzzles challenges
 Astrobytes: Not just that, but out of everyone you'd always find euler in chat, in between contests, keeping things going
 Astrobytes: That's what motivated me to try and keep chat active
 Astrobytes: Now I just think what's the damn point
 Astrobytes:  /bitterness
 Astrobytes: Don't listen to me.
 Wontonimo: i'm too noob here to understand
 Wontonimo: perhaps it's better for me that way
 Astrobytes: Most probably. Nothing to worry about in the grand scheme of things
 struct: the competitive side of cg has been marginalized
 struct: is that the right word?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 jacek: i wasnt that much into contests anway, but still... overtaken by clashes...
 struct: it was
 struct: when I joined
 struct: It was like 5/6 contests a year
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I know you're more into multis (board games) jacek but yeah, you know
 jacek: on the other hand, what other site offers variety of bot games
 Astrobytes: Well that's kinda the point though jacek, they fail to capitalise on that
 Astrobytes: The market is literally cornered, but it's not the market they want.
 Astrobytes: 2018-2019 was like contest city
 darkhorse64: Let's get positive: we have the SDK and we can make fancy things with it. There will be no more than 300 people in the lb but we can still have fun
 Kitkat260: hi
 jacek: good evening
 Kitkat260: how is everyone today?
 jacek: sunday evening..
 Kitkat260: nice
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: It's still a bitter pill, but yes.
 darkhorse64: Some are more disappointed than others
 Astrobytes: I'm still gonna be here for the multis but I feel like I'm in mourning atm.
 Astrobytes: And I miss euler.
 trictrac: perhaps euler will come back. what was the problem&#160;?
 dinwun450: huh?
 darkhorse64: CG stated several times that they want to organize weekly events. Let's wait for a concrete announcement
 Astrobytes: I think darkhorse64 could explain it faster than I can in French trictrac&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah I mean I'm still curious as to what they have in mind but... :salt:
 Kitkat260: hi
 Kitkat260: its quiet
 Kitkat260: today
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I also think it is dumb if they pushed him away (I do not know what happened eigher)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: He put his heart in CG
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you could feel it
 Astrobytes: Yes. 100%
 UnnamedCodinGamer: was also fast to answer any questions
 Wontonimo: i talked to him a couple times in my short time here.  he was great
 darkhorse64: Actually, he said because there are less contests, he has to reconsider his CG uptime
 darkhorse64: he did not say he rage quits
 Astrobytes: Yeah but compared to him being here every day...
 darkhorse64: true
 Wontonimo: there were these codejams in my town (in the before time) organized by a local dude.  They were pretty awesome
 Wontonimo: but as I learnt more and got more involved I found out that they were a huge money loss
 Astrobytes: Like I said earlier, euler's continued presence in the chat/on the site in between contests really encouraged me to try and keep this place alive a bit more - it used to completely die in between contests.
 Wontonimo: so, however CG is managing to keep this going, my hats off to them
 Astrobytes: Yeah totally, we know they do this for free at cost to them
 MSmits: well.. don't confuse chat activity with overall activity. You see tons of people submitting that never chat
 MSmits: or at least not in this channel
 Astrobytes: But we offered to outsource to ourselves as much as possible, and nothing
 OmerDrk: hmm so weird. why is my code giving error when I define a struct? everyting is looking correct
 Astrobytes: MSmits: sure, but activity was still very low in between contests
 Astrobytes: And ask the other channels too
 MSmits: yeah i twas
 MSmits: but still is i think
 MSmits: compared to during contest
 MSmits: people come when something happens
 Astrobytes: But they want clashers, not competitors...
 MSmits: how do you know
 MSmits: have they done much to increase the amount of clashing happening?
 MSmits: seems to me it was always like this in regards to clashing
 MSmits: the only thing that has changed as far as i can tell is that more multis appeared in the last year or so and less contests happen
 MSmits: from a regular player perspective i mean
 jacek: and more clashes in contributions :unamused:
 MSmits: sure that too, but that doesnt affect anything aside from more work looking at contributions 
 MSmits: I don't buy the  "dying community" frame of thinking
 Astrobytes: As per the discord discussion I refer to.
 Astrobytes: No, I also don't quite yet subscribe to dying community. But some good users have been really sidelined.
 MSmits: yes
 darkhorse64: Sure, we can miss contests but we have still lots of (increasing content) to play with
 MSmits: and that's sad
 MSmits: i agree darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: ^
 MSmits: we have to remember that many of those people that joined contests, came here only for contests. I'm not even sure you can consider someone part of the community when they are here for 10 days and then gone for 3-6 months
 MSmits: they are welcome to join ofc, but it's not the same as being part of the community
 MSmits: not sure what the numbers are on those
 MSmits: there are also people that come here for contests and then stick around after. Those are the people CG is missing out on with less contests
 MSmits: I think kar liso is one of those
 Astrobytes: Well yes, this was part of the discussion. CG had X-thousands of participants in Y contest!!! YAY. 
 Astrobytes: And for what?
 MSmits: these last few contests were insane in number of participants
 MSmits: i remember doing Xmas rush with less than 1k 
 MSmits: and some others with around 2k
 Astrobytes: Mmhm. And we've gained about 4 or 5 regular users.
 MSmits: that you chat with
 MSmits: many are invisible
 Astrobytes: No, that I see
 MSmits: really hard to say how many there are
 DomiKo: there are people that aren't really talkative, but they are part of community for sure
 darkhorse64: According to CG, contests do not attract that many people compared to people coming from google searches
 Wontonimo: i didn't even discover this side chat bar thing until about 2 months in
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics">https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics</a>
 Wontonimo: and tbh, my first experience was ... uninviting 
 struct: csb is losing 
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: what was your first experience of CG webchat?
 darkhorse64: I want more spikes
 Wontonimo: not particularly unplesant, just mostly ignored and stuff was inside ... and then the red text.  Why red?  I didn't know at first its red for everyone, and i thought I was being yelled at by a moderator
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Wontonimo: i don't remember exactly what was said ... i'd recommend blue or green
 Astrobytes: Yeah, green or blue would definitely be a bit less STOP CRIMINAL!
 jacek: Wontonimo red? why?
 Astrobytes: Or just a different bgcolor on the text
 Wontonimo: it really took me a while to realize it is always related to being talked to directly because when i send a direct message it doesn't show as red
 Astrobytes: It's a recognised issue that webchat is flawed - and it won't be fixed
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah, when I first saw the red colour the reply was like drilled into me (I think it was MSmits replying) I still remember it
 Wontonimo: later ... got2go
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: don't leave us hanging - what was it?!&#160;:)
 Westicles: Are people still thinking the next contest is the last one as we know it?
 Astrobytes: Not sure about that. I just miss euler.
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/2">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/2</a>
 Westicles: Yeah, euler was the personification of helpfulness 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think it was about Yavalath, saying that wins in random simulations are so rare
 UnnamedCodinGamer: something to this effect
 Astrobytes: That makes sense!
 Astrobytes: Westicles: generally a great guy tbh
 zhoubou: Just stopping by to say hello. I might come back more in near future. Not sure.
 Astrobytes: zhoubou!
 zhoubou: How are you guys? And what happened to euler?
 zhoubou: Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: How was the exam? And what's up?
 zhoubou: I passed it! Yeah!
 Astrobytes: zhoubou: my maaan nice one&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I had every faith in you
 zhoubou: Thank you :D
 zhoubou: I'm mostly doing the Codecademy's CS career path, not much else
 Astrobytes: What's the situation with coming back here or not?
 zhoubou: Well I'm not sure, I haven't gotten much motivation lately
 zhoubou: Which is not good. Hopefully it improves
 MSmits: UnnamedCodinGamer, wins from random simulations in yavalath are rare because most games end in suicide. 
 MSmits: for nostalgia
 Astrobytes: zhoubou: You and me both. I'm still around though
 zhoubou: I've been reading the chat here and there, but haven't said anything in a while
 UnnamedCodinGamer: MSmits, exactly, now I remembered
 Astrobytes: MSmits: hehe, it was a very Smits yava statement :D
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 MSmits: np, let me know if you want me to say this again in a year or so :grin:
 Astrobytes: Been quiet the past week or so zhoubou
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 zhoubou: Yeah, I don't know how long :P
 zhoubou: It feels like years tbh
 Astrobytes: Well if you're around don't be a strager, you can always pm
 Astrobytes: *stranger
 MSmits: standard rager
 Astrobytes: :D
 zhoubou: I'm going to try harder next time
 zhoubou: It's just the way I am I guess
 zhoubou: It's the same in rl and WhatsApp and stuff
 MSmits: you are of the lurker-type
 Astrobytes: I get you man
 zhoubou: Exactly MSmits :P
 MSmits: me too sometimes, mostly not though
 Astrobytes: "mostly not" :P
 zhoubou: Astrobytes I'm trying to improve constantly, and I have been improving some in recent times, then I fell back to the old ways
 zhoubou: I don't know why
 zhoubou: It's pretty comfortable here with you guys, I don't understand my brain sometimes
 Astrobytes: Nobody understands their brain.
 MSmits: if your brain understands itself it may get stuck in a recursive loop
 zhoubou: Haha true
 Astrobytes: Might be a good thing....
 MSmits: ^
 Astrobytes: it's 100% good in MSmits case :D
 MSmits: yep
 zhoubou: For his own sake eh :P
 Astrobytes: For all our sakes!
 zhoubou: :rofl:
 TBali: are there really no standard "split string by delimiter to vector" library function in C++?
 TBali: like Pyhon split() or PHP explode()?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, use a stringstream
 Astrobytes: and tokenize from that
 TBali: I found a few lines solution but it is still strange. 
 TBali: most used function in solo puzzles inout parsing.
 Astrobytes: Hate the game not the player!
 BlaiseEbuth: Why not both&#160;?
 TBali: I hate all the haters except myself&#160;:-)
 Passifi: Why hate at all&#160;? Have some gummi bears&#160;:)
 TBali: yeah, hate leads to suffering. Yoda already told that
 Astrobytes: Just send rainbows to BlaiseEbuth, I heard he likes those :D
 Passifi: everything leads to suffering Yoda is a twat its just that blind rage is more fun and better for your skin 
 Passifi: and gummi bears trumps all
 BlaiseEbuth: I got no feelings, ah no feelingsNo feelings for anybody elseExcept for myself, my beautiful selfish
 Westicles: boost has split if you are talking outside CG
 TBali: I converted some puzzle solutions to c++
 TBali: (not with your method&#160;:-))
 Westicles: heh heh
 Astrobytes: lol
 TBali: whis weekend I have read 160 pages from the 1300+ Stroustroup book.
 TBali: Now I allowed to use C++ functions starting with letter a or b 
 Astrobytes: Yeah boost has some handy things. Is there any extra string parsing stuff in C++20? I mean ranges and stuff sure help
 TBali: CG should support only C++98
 TBali: that language has already too big advantage
 BlaiseEbuth: C++20&#160;? It's so old...
 TBali: can you apply preincrement to int literals?
 TBali: than it is 21
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/531432742">https://www.codingame.com/replay/531432742</a>
 DomiKo: most exciting game in PRC
 Astrobytes: Game of teh Year DomiKo!
 BlaiseEbuth: Poker Rip Chace&#160;?
 DomiKo: I guess yes
 Astrobytes: RIP Race. Choker.
 MSmits: is the yellow guy calling out bingo numbers
 darkhorse64: issue one move for excitement
 MSmits: I bet your sim is perfect DomiKo
 DomiKo: perfectly bugged*
 BlaiseEbuth: Even chips respect social distanciation.
 Astrobytes: fix your English BlaiseEbuth
 DomiKo: When you are so tired of PCR that even chips stop moving
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 TBali: Blaise, just checking your new puzzle - nice background story!
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope. I try aproximative fr-&gt;en translation when I don't know the word.
 MSmits: google translations are getting too good&#160;:(
 TBali: better than google translate I suppose
 ivandrofly: ahah @msmits why u said that
 BlaiseEbuth:  Thx TBali. I have a little change to do.
 MSmits: it's funny when the translation is poor
 Astrobytes: Close BlaiseEbuth, it's 'distancing'
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah google translate is able to translate approximations correctly...
 GR33NB33N1376: Im very confused with this website.
 MSmits: I'm very confused with you being confused
 TBali: I remember feeding the text of the childrend song "wheels on the bus go round and round" to google translate
 MSmits: uh oh
 GR33NB33N1376: Well its just, i dont understand what to do.
 MSmits: you can do anything
 MSmits: what do you *want* to do
 TBali: The "mummies on the bus " part was frankly translated to Hungarian with the word for Egyptian mummy.
 MSmits: funny
 TBali: (Nothing to do with an of the words for Mom)
 BlaiseEbuth: TBali <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT09O3tqaT4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT09O3tqaT4</a>
 TBali: maybe the context was not enough.
 TBali: But it was years ago and it DID improve a lot.
 Westicles: Isn't the quest map for new guys who don't know what to do?
 TBali: Now it is actually faster to use it for a draft translation and then correct the errors.
 TBali: That was not the case 5y ago  (with Hungarian at least) - maybe it was better for more used languages
 TBali: LOL that video
 BlaiseEbuth: Just an example, there's many others. ^^
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah! I'm the first one to solve my puzzle&#160;!
 Westicles: Sheesh, all these two line solutions to if-then-else are making me feel stupid
 TBali: lol, I used 50
 TBali: I avoid avoid regexp when I can
 TBali: Man with a Plan:"There's also the house of a crazy wizard, who teleport anyone he sees to the closest point of interest. "Is it manhattan distance or euclides? or shortest travel time?
 BlaiseEbuth: RTFM!
 TBali: I did!&#160;:-)
 BlaiseEbuth: First one of a long serie. Thx to be the first.
 BlaiseEbuth: No enough, or not completely...
 Westicles: "The wizard uses Manhattan distances."
 TBali: Ah I found it at constraints.
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 TBali: This statement is longer than my operating memory.
 BlaiseEbuth: Add RAM
 TBali: too old motherboard
 TBali: No chips available for the 1-bit bus-width I have
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://downloadmoreram.com/">https://downloadmoreram.com/</a>
 AntiSquid: is it ram as a services?
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a trap!
 Westicles: You had to get CG to increase the character limit on statements?  ha
 TBali: I use WOM
 Westicles: Ain't nobody gonna read all that
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact the limit was supposed to be already increased before, but the change was not effective.
 TBali: I disagree. With such story it is okay
 TBali: Short attence span users won't solve hard puzzles anyhow
 TBali: CoC is there for them
 TBali: * attention (?)
 TBali: but the tracklist is acccessible only with spotify refgistration so I skip that 
 Astrobytes: attention yes
 TBali: Hopefuly these songs are not about  best pathfinding algorithms and how to code them
 Astrobytes: And yeah, I have no issue with long problem statements if they're interesting and pertinent to the problem(s) at hand.
 Astrobytes: They are not TBali :D
 TBali: I know 2 songs from the tracklist
 TBali: Gloryhammer and Sabaton
 TBali: Seen them both in past 2 years
 BlaiseEbuth: I just got a mail about graspop cancellation.&#160;:(
 jacek: or daft punk&#160;:?
 Stark-program: is there like a "difficulty" setting for the clash of code?
 Stark-program: cause im getting destroyed
 TBali: there is not
 Westicles: And a 2 line solution to IPV6 shortener
 TBali: theis is not codegolf. the question is: are these solution readable at all?
 Westicles: Yeah... turns out python has a builtin function for the IP one.  For ITE it is readable, just uses eval
 TBali: using eval() is like a cheat&#160;:-)
 TBali: like system()
 Westicles: yeah
 TBali: hmm, php also has lots of built in functions.... let't try: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ce6e695c-b52e-4cff-a046-d09cbc9dc78f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ce6e695c-b52e-4cff-a046-d09cbc9dc78f</a>
 tutubalin: if-then-else can be solved with 1-liner without eval
 tutubalin: my JS solution is 77 chars long
 pardouin: my first solution was just a recursive function without eval but then I found funny to abuse eval
 elderlybeginner: is there any way to send a private message to a user when he is not on discord or not following?
 Wontonimo: let me answer that question with a question, how good are you at reverse engineering and javascript?
 ClashofCock: using anything more high level than assembly is cheating
 elderlybeginner: isn't assembly cheating? you can type with bytes
 AntiSquid: i see you love coc
 Wontonimo: m.sender
 Wontonimo: (oops)
 Westicles: if they have ever posted to the forum you can message there
 tutubalin: oh, i reduced if-then-else to 71 characters
 tutubalin: wait... to 67&#160;:)
 java_coffee_cup: :scream: it is close to writing asm
 hex.master8:&#160;?
 hex.master8: how do you change your profile picture

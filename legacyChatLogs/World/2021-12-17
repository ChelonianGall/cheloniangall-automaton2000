 UZUHAMA: Hello wold
 ChickenCoder123: eval(rm -rf /)
 jaialser66: I CANT EVEN SOLVE a level easy problem 
 UZUHAMA: Easy is not easy
 unkowone: system discord
 unkowone: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa556203-9367-48ca-9ac3-d3089a3be4da">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa556203-9367-48ca-9ac3-d3089a3be4da</a>
 Flaise: Well I think the easy problems are easy. ...But I've been coding for many years. `-`
 unkowone: bruh
 UZUHAMA: The validators for Unary is just TERRIBLE
 UZUHAMA: How am I supposed to know what's wrong with my code?
 UZUHAMA: The last validator is just nonsense
 Flaise: Go through the instructions more slowly, step by step. Are you printing inputs and outputs to stderr?
 UZUHAMA: what is stderr
 UZUHAMA: Oh no
 UZUHAMA: I have to get 100% at code to view the solution
 UZUHAMA: How am I supposed to know what's wrong
 UZUHAMA: sigh...
 Flaise: Your standard error stream. You print the final output to standard-out and you print debugging info to standard-error
 UZUHAMA: I don't think I'm doinng that
 UZUHAMA: Since the rest of the validators are working just fine
 Flaise: If you don't know what stderr is then you're not. What language are you using?
 UZUHAMA: Java
 Flaise: System.err.println("message"), if I recall correctly
 Flaise: Try it and it'll show up in your console
 UZUHAMA: It shows up
 UZUHAMA: But it's not affecting the validaors
 UZUHAMA: What the heck?
 Flaise: No, it's a debugging tool
 Flaise: stderr doesn't affect the validators
 UZUHAMA: hmm
 UZUHAMA: ok
 Flaise: Do you think you understand the instructions well enough to write the correct answers by hand?
 UZUHAMA: Yeah
 Flaise: Then what you do is you use stderr to print intermediate values so you know what your code is doing throughout its execution. Then you have an idea of what went wrong.
 UZUHAMA: So put stderr everywhere
 UZUHAMA: ok
 Flaise: Sure, it's a start! Eventually you'll notice something amiss and can fix it.
 UZUHAMA: yep

 Archy1232: she shong chai, chiling dilling
 Flaise: OMG! omgomgomgomg I finally solved the Mars Lander optimization. I did it once with an if-ladder bu that's fuel use is not very optimal. This time I did it with some trigonometry and the trajectories are smoother.
 5AMO7: who tf cares
 jacek: so, you used math? :scream:
 Mike_Oxlong: meth?
 Archy1232: meth????
 5AMO7: Meth
 djslime2: meth?????
 GiveMeAJob: jessie
 5DN1L: If you guys continue to spam, you'll be kicked out
 Flaise: Yeah, I actually used that SOH CAH TOA thing from math class so many years ago. Didn't even have to look it up. :O
 5AMO7: wdym spam
 djslime2: sorry admin me so sowwy

 djslime2: im not a spam
 StrixTheTeemo: y kick
 Urutar: It's in the rules.
 unkowone: sir yes sir
 GiveMeAJob: mods how to make group chat for hot milfs
 Urutar: Spamming and other disruptive behaviour leads to kicks and bans
 Flaise: Urutar: Thanks! It took /3 days/ to figure it out. :sweat_smile:
 unkowone: yes sir yes
 unkowone: no spamming
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, hopefully peace for a while here after 3 have been kicked out
 Automaton2000: i assume that if you say so
 5DN1L: Yes, please assume that
 Urutar: :D
 5DN1L: Urutar Thanks for that explanation on disruptive behaviour while I was busy typing the kick commands lol
 Urutar: Np&#160;:)
 Urutar: It annoys me aswell, and I can eventually do something about it, so yeah
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Mike_Oxlong: nigga
 5DN1L: One more kick there
 jacek: imagine when christmas break starts ~
 5DN1L: Let's close our eyes and pretend nothing is broken...
 jacek: truly, a mod material
 djslime2: our table is broken
 5DN1L: And you've been kicked
 Archy1232: oh no
 5DN1L: oh yes
 Archy1232: our table
 5DN1L: Archy1232 do you want a kick too?
 Archy1232: no daddy
 StrixTheTeemo: ok
 StrixTheTeemo: anyone wanna play leauge
 KakaDookie: hello
 jacek: leauge?
 KakaDookie: lets play league
 KakaDookie: i main big chungos teemo
 KakaDookie: guys do you support bldm
 5DN1L: If you guys continue to misbehave, it'll be banning instead of just kicking
 KakaDookie: oh no daddy
 KakaDookie: daddy chill
 BigChunkus: o shit please no ban
 5DN1L: now stop saying nonsense here
 Archy1232: how do i complete easy loops?
 Chonkus: anybody up for a game of clash of codes?&#160;:)
 KakaDookie: ok can you help withThe Collatz Conjecture

 BigChunkus: ok ty
 White_Code: can anyone help me with mad pod racing
 Urutar: Anyone up for a #clash&#160;?
 5DN1L: White_Code: What kind of help do you need?
 White_Code: I don't understand how to do this thing , how to move the pod
 Urutar: You write the coordinates for each pod (atm probably just one) each round
 Urutar: And then it moves in that direction
 Urutar: And include thrust
 Urutar: So for example print("500 500 100")
 HXavS: public is fine
 Urutar: Where 500 are X and Y respectively
 5DN1L: Thanks HXavS&#160;:)
 DialFrost: anybody free rn to check out my code in mad
 DialFrost: its literally moving at speed 10 half the time
 5DN1L: And why's that DialFrost?
 DialFrost: idk
 DialFrost: i added angles
 DialFrost: but it messed it up somehow
 5DN1L: Add debugging in your code.
 5DN1L: See how the speed varies
 DialFrost: and i still have the same problem as before of the bot turning the wrong way for 1 turn before turning back round
 5DN1L: Same method - debugging to see why the code behaves so
 DialFrost: howw tho
 DialFrost: it js does it naturally
 DialFrost: idk y
 5DN1L: No, your code dictates how your pod moves
 5DN1L: Add debug code, see how the variables change each turn, see in which turn the variables go wrong
 DialFrost: err
 HXavS: 5DN1L out of curiosity. for the clash of code. there is an advantage depending on the language you chose to use in short mode due to limitations of how language operate. i.e. Some languages require more char for min program. Is that something Codingame are thinking about weighting or trimming chars for non disposable characters 
 Urutar: Hm, maybe you have a print line somewhere in there?
 Urutar: Which makes your execution "lag beind"?
 HXavS: for instance python print() vs c# Console.WriteLine()
 5DN1L: HXavS yes indeed some languages have an advantage over others. but it also depends on how fast you are and how good your competitors are
 Kururugi: you need python/ruby knowledge to complete the shortest code//code golf ones
 DialFrost: nah
 HXavS: Yeah, but for the short mode with 15 min games I have found that there are just some char limits I can't beat due to char limits. 
 DialFrost: the gods of code golf
 DialFrost: are c objective c and perl
 DialFrost: ruby can be gd as well
 5DN1L: then pray for your competitors to achieve &lt;100% so your longer code still wins :P
 Kururugi: lol
 Urutar: :D
 Urutar: Yeahhhh about that
 Urutar: I was in a private clash, only java allowed... :rolling_eyes:I was the only one with 100%, the rest had ALL 0% (all 6 of em)
 Urutar: Really sadresult
 HXavS: Kururugi, yeah but as for wanting to practice one language in a moment over another is discouraging. Just saying that codingame code read Console.WriteLine() as a statement worth 1 char as well as print in python to even the playing field
 5DN1L: It won't happen, HXavS
 5DN1L: Different languages have their different advantages
 HXavS: Figured it would, was just a thought
 Kururugi: Sadly it wont
 Urutar: What about using static System.Console;and then Write/ReadLine?
 HXavS: wouldn't
 ShandonM: :hamburger:
 Urutar: Yeah, such is life sometimes
 5DN1L: The languages which don't shine in code golf may shine in bot programming games in terms of speed and performance
 HXavS: Urutar I have used that trick in the past
 ShandonM: Here have a Burber
 Urutar: :D
 Urutar: Yay, Burbers.
 Urutar:&#160;;)
 ShandonM: Coding all comes down to the coder
 HXavS: :100:
 ShandonM: Happy coder = happy code
 HXavS: unhappy coder = spaghetti 
 ShandonM: I want Spaghetti. Guess I have to get depressed
 HXavS: well If I have to read someone elses spaghetti I will be
 ShandonM: :sob: = :spaghetti:
 ShandonM: I wanna just make my War Thunder replacement game
 HXavS: if(mood &lt; happy) { return :spaghetti:
 HXavS: }
 ShandonM: ifelse (:hamburger:
 ShandonM: Burger fixes all bugs
 Kururugi: borgar!
 ShandonM: Sorry I mean *Burber
 HXavS: try(){
 ShandonM: list(Burber, Spaghetti)
 ShandonM: Mindset
 HXavS: Catch(exception ex){
 ShandonM: int main
 ShandonM: int N;
 ShandonM: scanf(Burber##);
 5DN1L: ok guys, enough random code
 ShandonM: Sorry trying to order a virtual Burber
 HXavS: Haha
 ShandonM: int Menu
 5DN1L: ShandonM won't happen in this chat, please stop
 ShandonM: Nooo!
 5DN1L: yes, if you don't stop, you'll be kicked out
 HXavS: Virtual I was thinking of implementing some api or a curl request function auto that orders delivery
 HXavS: 5DN1L Fair
 ShandonM: Sorry sorry
 ShandonM: Basically: Scan for Burber, If have Burber = order
 ShandonM: Cause I'm hungry boys
 LelouchVC2: Kururugi&#160;!
 ShandonM: If see burger. I order
 5DN1L: If see one more line of that, I kick
 LelouchVC2: what is a burger but something between 2 buns
 LelouchVC2: and what are better buns than a womans'?
 ShandonM: @5DN1L sorry it wasn't a code
 5DN1L: I don't care whether it's code or not. I'll kick if it's spam
 Uljahn: just /join #burber and do what you want there
 ShandonM: Lmao
 LelouchVC2: What's next? #coding if you wanna talk about programming!
 jacek: and #fr for friends
 HXavS: Wait. this is my first time in chat so /join #channel creates a chanel? 
 HXavS: perfect was about to ask for that
 5DN1L: Uljahn do you know where I can get the chat id? I can't find the faq this points me to: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://forum.codingame.com/t/feature-update-chat-rework/1556/20">http://forum.codingame.com/t/feature-update-chat-rework/1556/20</a>

 5DN1L: ah thanks BlaiseEbuth
 ShandonM: Yes War Thunder
 ShandonM: Do you guys ever forget to switch languages?
 ShandonM: Happens a lot for me
 DialFrost: er
 LelouchVC2: Yea, I'll be speaking giberish and forget to speak english
 DialFrost: i only code in 2 languages
 DialFrost: so nope
 DialFrost: or speak*
 DialFrost: both 2 &lt;3
 ShandonM: Well in World language yes I forget I'm speaking Western Russian or Japanese
 LelouchVC2: Checaslavisionara
 ShandonM: And Code I either forget I'm on Java and C
 LelouchVC2: I'm disgusted
 ShandonM: and all the C's like C++
 HXavS: c#
 ShandonM: Yeh
 LelouchVC2: C# &gt; Java
 LelouchVC2: C++ &gt; C
 ShandonM: Python = Dead
 ShandonM: I'm dead
 LelouchVC2: Hotel &gt; Trivago
 ShandonM: 5 &gt; 6
 ShandonM: I broke math
 DialFrost: wonder wat the mods are thinking about this :D
 ShandonM: What the hell are these idiots talking about
 ShandonM: But we are Smort idiots
 5DN1L: I'm watching :smirk:
 LelouchVC2: mods are actually just bots
 LelouchVC2: you see?
 LelouchVC2: You mention and they post like automation3000
 ShandonM: Nah the mods are like Super Humans infused with code
 ShandonM: They ARE code
 LelouchVC2: bots arent code?
 ShandonM: Nah they aren't
 ShandonM: :neutral_face:
 ShandonM: See bots share a similar structure as their cousins the blts
 ShandonM: *BLTs
 ShandonM: See Bot's are Bacon, Onion. and Lettuce
 ShandonM: Also GN
 LelouchVC2: Yes yes, idk how i didnt see this before
 LelouchVC2: good night 😂
 LelouchVC2: @5DN1L
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 ShandonM: PS: followed you Lelouch
 LelouchVC2: a bit stalkerish 
 LelouchVC2: but alright 0-0
 ShandonM: It's not stalkerish if it's with consent
 LelouchVC2: 😳
 LelouchVC2: Consent... given &lt;3
 ShandonM: Niiice
 Urutar: Alright, this got weird quickly
 Uljahn: use DM guys or get a room :smirk:
 Urutar: Or both
 Urutar: :D
 ShandonM: The room would be too cramped
 ShandonM: And this is my serious final SEE YA
 ShandonM: GN

 Illedan: Maybe I should sell an NFT of me with a shirt to fund a new shirt :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Totally doable with underwears...
 TimothyAlexisVass: &gt;:(
 eulerscheZahl: finally I can tab-complete without double-checking or typing all but the last letter
 BlaiseEbuth: Not before?
 eulerscheZahl: hard to get the right one sometimes, when there are so many users in the list. reduced options are a blessing
 BlaiseEbuth: List isn't the same for mods? Didn't noticed...
 eulerscheZahl: mods see everyone online, now i'm back to those who are chatting + online mods
 Flaise: Yay...?
 struct: ill have to ask for a raise
 BlaiseEbuth: Collabo...:angry:
 Flaise: oooh, there's a user list button at the bottom. I literally did not know that until I checked just now. xD
 eulerscheZahl: and moderators see everyone online - so a few hundreds
 eulerscheZahl: which is a pain when you want to tab-complete a nickname
 BlaiseEbuth: Hundreds? Where are the 100k active users? :o
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, going for a walk and then back to topcoder marathon
 AntiSquid: blaise no comment on earnings, but you got to look at crypto from a different perspective and see all the benefits it brings
 resty-daze: wow you're playing topcoder
 Flaise: Why can't tab-completion just be restricted to the active users. It doesn't have to be tied to the users you can see online if it's useless with that many users.
 BlaiseEbuth: AntiSquid: can you develop?
 AntiSquid: what do you mean
 AntiSquid: develop assets&#160;? :joy:
 BlaiseEbuth: What are these perspectives and benefits?
 AntiSquid: ah "elaborate" you mean 
 AntiSquid: well first of all you have a new way of trading and the way you trade
 BlaiseEbuth: Hm... Probably.
 AntiSquid: my main reason is inflation
 AntiSquid: i am surprised there's no gov controlled crypto considering all the digital vax passports out there ...
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't trade so I don't see what's the difference with classic currency trading... :thinking:
 AntiSquid: trade includes buying stuff
 BlaiseEbuth: :confused:
 Kira_Repaer: could I get some help with boss 2 on Mad pod?
 AntiSquid: i'm out bye
 5DN1L: What kind of help do you need?
 wlesavo: pushed 5 people in Galleon Wars legend :smiley:
 5DN1L: nice
 Nandita: I am able to beat the boss 3 in mad pod racing  but my League remains the same. Do I have to have 1st rank in Arena too
 5DN1L: Yes, you have to above the boss of that league
 5DN1L: to be*
 Nandita: oh&#160;:( 
 Mortis_666: 5DN1L the solid integer puzzle my way now is converting n to base 9 and it pass 1 2 3 4 case and fail 5 6 7 8 9 case lol
 5DN1L: because it's not purely base 9 conversion :smirk:
 Mortis_666: ya i know
 Mortis_666: if it is 9 it will be 10
 Mortis_666: lol
 5DN1L: Generate a list of the smallest solid integers using the most naive way, then run your code to see if your code generates the same list to check where the bugs are
 Mortis_666: ok
 Es_Sm: hi
 Mortis_666: hi
 Zarchi: hi
 Es_Sm: omggggggggggg guyssssssssssss do u know how to programmeeeeeeeeeee
 5DN1L: First, fix your keyboard not to repeat your keys for so much
 Es_Sm: that was my friend, sorry
 5DN1L: Whatever, just don't repeat the same behaviour
 Mortis_666: lol
 ProMikeSundays: xd
 5DN1L: that was my cat, that was my friend, that was my fish, that was my mouse
 Es_Sm: exactly 
 Mortis_666: that was my hand
 BlaiseEbuth: That was you.
 5DN1L: whatever that was, that was none of my business :shrug:
 Mortis_666: Fun fact:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/mini-sudoku-solver">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/mini-sudoku-solver</a> is hard when <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sudoku-solver">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sudoku-solver</a> is medium

 Mortis_666: wow
 Mortis_666: thats complex
 5DN1L: Exact cover can be used to solve a couple of puzzles on CG
 5DN1L: Of course you can also use recursion to solve sudoku
 5DN1L: google and you can find some relevant explanation
 Mortis_666: thx
 Mortis_666: the only field that i am better then u is collaboration lol
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Mortis_666:&#160;:)
 Mortis_666: btw im thinking of creating a classic puzzle but im still trying to find the solution lol
 5DN1L: oh, that's a puzzle indeed heehee
 Mortis_666: wtf my puzzle is set as private and it has 2 viewa
 Mortis_666: views*
 Mortis_666: 😱
 Mortis_666: i didnt share the link to anyone
 5DN1L: :shrug: not sure how that works
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Mortis_666, you viewed it twice
 Mortis_666: my view is also counted?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yep
 Mortis_666: i exit and view it again and it is still 2
 rekaxem: it takes time to update
 Mortis_666: ok
 codergautam: how to win clash of code
 codergautam: help
 rekaxem: oh
 rekaxem: i think 
 rekaxem: you need to train your speed
 codergautam: ok
 rekaxem: by playing more
 nervus: just keep playing
 codergautam: k
 rekaxem: does anyone wanna play clash now
 codergautam: i n a match
 Mortis_666: me
 TimothyAlexisVass: sure
 rekaxem: oh were in the same match

 NlcknameAlreadyTaken:     <img height="300" /> [Random Linked Item]
 eulerscheZahl: it would be a major security flaw if this would work
 NlcknameAlreadyTaken: y
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. That could compromise the security of this chat where mods right and ban can be changed by an update of the site certificates, wich can be read without account...
 eulerscheZahl: if i should accidentally regain my powers, i'll kick you for this critical message&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 NlcknameAlreadyTaken: i will remind you
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not anymore sensitive to this kind of things...
 BlaiseEbuth: I really love the "Banned nick replacement feature" of the chat. There was another good one earlier. :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: banned nick replacement?
 eulerscheZahl: what's that
 BlaiseEbuth: A 'feature' of the chat. Under certain (unknown) conditions, When an user is banned 
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: then the previous messages of that user change the author name?
 eulerscheZahl: (at least on chat reload)
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup. For the CM's one

 Eff82: Is testcase 05 in "What's so complex about Mandelbrot?" wrong? My solution is 1 iteration less, and the actual tests pass 100%
 Eff82: FailureFound: 123Expected: 124
 5DN1L: probably not wrong, if i remember correctly, it's easy to get precision issues in that puzzle
 Eff82: well I'm not going to import numpy, to get better precision ,than python float&#160;:)
 b0n5a1: Mandelbrot schmackt gut&#160;!
 <b>**b0n5a1 is already away...</b></p><p><img src="/a/1848632360793" /> b0n5a1: o/

 eulerscheZahl: Aneo was a prime example of precision problems
 eulerscheZahl: but that one's deleted now
 Astrobytes: no real loss, wasn't particularly interesting
 eulerscheZahl: i agree
 eulerscheZahl: the great dispatch was much more painful
 b0n5a1: oops yes, schmeckt :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: still much better than my French
 eulerscheZahl: salut, je m'apelle Ralph
 b0n5a1: ^^
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 BlaiseEbuth: Be careful Astrobytes, Ralph eat cats.
 Eff82: 5DN1L thanks, abs(r) + abs(i) &gt; 2 vs. r*r + i*i &gt; 4 solved it
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: That was ALF not Ralph
 5DN1L: Eff82 :thumbsup:
 BlaiseEbuth: Same with a R
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm trying to be inclusive with you, old guys, by  using old ref' you can get, and you annoy me with details... :unamused:
 Eff82: Is there any way, to see which puzzles I haven't solved in a specific language?I know I can see my solutions for a specific puzzle, but it would be nice to have a way, to select a language, and have the puzzles solved state on the puzzle list page

 LelouchVC2: yes
 willdrinkyourblood: only 9 people?
 LelouchVC2: that might be the people who are talking in the chat
 willdrinkyourblood: oh ok
 Astrobytes: only moderators can see everyone
 BlaiseEbuth: And NSA.
 willdrinkyourblood:&#160;:|
 LelouchVC2: NSA has been spying on me for a while, they want to know how I pick up chicks and they dont
 Astrobytes: because you hang around in henhouses waiting for eggs to hatch and they don't? :smirk:
 LelouchVC2: 100%, i pick those chicks up and hear them chirp ;D Then they think im their mother
 willdrinkyourblood: now they know
 Astrobytes: :hatching_chick:
 LelouchVC2: They'll never know my tru secret 0-0
 BlaiseEbuth: I just pick the eggs and cook a cheese omelette.
 alr8al: im nop in coding
 Astrobytes: which CPU arch?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you must be desperate, trying witty banter with the hoi polloi
 Astrobytes: lol, as opposed to...?
 Scarfield: Desperobytes
 Astrobytes: hey Scarfologist
 Scarfield: oi
 Astrobytes: :punk:
 Astrobytes: darn
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: how's it going?
 Scarfield: all good, but maybe looking into another lockdown soon
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: since my transition #fr is open all the time.  much more elegant there
 Scarfield: how bout you? still no development with your back issues i guess=
 Scarfield: did you use to be Mr. GloriaZindlebocker?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: a lady never tells
 Astrobytes: Not much really no, lots of dehumanising interviews with government welfare departments though, nice additional stress.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the situation over here is nuts right now. Can't see this crap going away for some time at this rate.
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: that's Westicles 
 Scarfield: oh lol, was a pun at his "since my transisition" :p
 Scarfield: transition* 
 BlaiseEbuth: Scarpun
 Scarfield: yea welfare stuff sucks. am searching for a job myself, and am obligated to show up 5 days a week for 2½hrs at a "job center", have been told to stay home if we have any covid symptoms, stayed home a couple of times because of having a cough. apparently they have told my union i might not be fit for work, since i have some 2 day duration sick leaves.. 
 Astrobytes: fs
 Astrobytes: *ffs
 Astrobytes: I have similar but bi-weekly (cause medical issues) and via video call
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't search a job. [solved]
 Scarfield: talked with my union today, she immediatly closed the case, and literally sighed when i told her i wasnt informed by job center, or asked why i called in sick
 Astrobytes: heh, sounds just as incompetent and dysfunctional as here. I feel weirdly comforted.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I'm with Blaise.  Drink wine until the money runs out, then drive off a cliff Thelma and Louis style
 Scarfield: im happy its weekend now, i would have a hard time not telling the idiot at job center, that he is a fekking idiot
 Overbed: hello i was making this code but i ran into some problems
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/207b440c-8f02-4a31-987d-ea77c0a22b41">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/207b440c-8f02-4a31-987d-ea77c0a22b41</a>
 Scarfield: im more a beer or whiskey guy
 Overbed: so i have to make it so every 4 numbers so like 8 = 2 i have to print that
 Overbed: 12 = 3
 Overbed: 16 = 4
 Overbed: 15 = 3
 Overbed: i have to print the amount of times the 4 is in the input
 Overbed: how much 4s it takes 
 Overbed: python btw
 Scarfield: the&#160;% gives you the remainder, you can use range(start, end, increment)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Hey, that's the dutch guy who is buddies with Paul Cooijmans
 Overbed: bro :skull:
 Overbed: so what function can i use for it
 lakaoe: n = int(input())s = (n // 4)
 Scarfield: im not entirely sure what you want it to do, can you link the puzzle?
 Overbed: it is a private coc
 Overbed: Here are the constraints:1) The robot can jump up to 4 tiles at any point (say current tile is 2, then the robot can reach 3, 4, 5, 6 tiles in the next jump).2) The destination is at Nth tile.3) Assume Robot is on 1st tile.
 Scarfield: oh missed your comment Astrobytes, yea im convinced the people who work at these places, only work there because they cant get work anywhere else, generally at least
 Scarfield: Overbed and return the number of turns needed?
 Overbed: yes
 Overbed: InputGiven N, the number of tiles.OutputPrint the minimum number of jumps the robot needs to reach his destination.
 Scarfield: same code except inside range
 Scarfield: range(1,n,4)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: this clash seems less private than usual
 Scarfield: range(start, end, increment)
 Overbed: for i in range(0, n):
 Overbed: waht do i add
 Overbed: increment
 Overbed: whats that
 Overbed: oh i got it
 Overbed: nvm
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range</a>
 Overbed: what
 Overbed: i got 75&#160;%
 lakaoe: my round doesnt work or something
 Scarfield: might need to do range(1,n+1,4) the stop probably isnt inclusive
 lakaoe: is there a thing named round_up
 Scarfield: ceil()
 ShakeDatBunda: math,ceil
 ShakeDatBunda: math.ceil
 Stormyy: can you guys confirm that bitwolf, tychkorg, etc are bots lmaoo
 ShakeDatBunda: yep
 ShakeDatBunda: they officially stated it as wekk
 Overbed: bitwolf is always only
 ShakeDatBunda: well
 ShakeDatBunda: somewhere
 ShakeDatBunda: I remember reading it
 Overbed: olnine
 ShakeDatBunda: that they do add bots sometimes to lobbie
 ShakeDatBunda: *lobbies
 Scarfield: there are official coc bots, if too few players join, the bots join to let the clash continue
 Stormyy: okok lmao thansk
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 Scarfield: you are not the first (nor the last) to wonder
 Overbed: ailureProcess has timed out. This may mean that your solution is not optimized enough to handle some cases. Scarfield
 Overbed: 912345699 is too much ig
 Stormyy: optimizing is no fun
 Overbed: bruh thats evil
 Overbed: how do i even optimize that
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/174c331a-66bd-4d85-b4b9-edb6333d7cb8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/174c331a-66bd-4d85-b4b9-edb6333d7cb8</a>
 Overbed: a golfer/
 Scarfield: dont use range, i just wanted to give you an answer similar to your starting code
 Scarfield: when using range like that 912345699 / 4 is a lot of iterations
 Scarfield: you could divide n with 4, and if the result has a non zero decimal.. what then? :p
 Overbed: oh smart
 Overbed: does&#160;% mean how much times something is in it like 10%3 = 3?
 Scarfield: no
 Overbed: what does&#160;% do then
 Scarfield: its the remainder, so 3 goes into 10 3 times 3'3 = 9, the "remainder then is 1
 Scarfield: 10%3 = 1
 Overbed: ohhhh
 Overbed: so what thingie is for checking how much something is in the number
 jacek: hm?
 Overbed: how can i check how much 3 is in input
 lakaoe: print((n * (n - 1)) // 2)
 Overbed: nvm
 Stormyy: lol division
 jacek: lol math
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Where's that FAQ I've been asking for with minimum requirements to code?
 jacek: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 Scarfield: - woking keyboard- working pc- working screen (preferably)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: 125 IQ for bots, 90 for clash.  Proficient in English and math through arctangents
 lakaoe: how to print 15 for every 1 in input
 lakaoe: for example
 lakaoe: 3 = 45
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it can be done with atan
 Scarfield: eh&#160;?
 lakaoe: in python
 Scarfield: like add 15 for each input?
 lakaoe: like
 lakaoe: for a variable
 jacek: print(15) [solved]
 lakaoe: thanks
 jacek: or 15*n&#160;:?
 lakaoe: wow
 lakaoe: im so stupid
 Scarfield: it really was that xD
 jacek: huh
 <b>**Astrobytes is so glad he's free of mod duties now</b></p><p><img src="/a/73294709815061" /> Scarfield: oO
 jacek: thats why im not trolling
 Scarfield: didnt notice
 jacek: :rage:
 lakaoe: :rage:
 Scarfield: btw watched dark city that got recommended here a few weeks ago, was a great movie
 Overbed: how to check if number is uneven like 1 3 5 7 9
 Scarfield: you can easily google that&#160;;) but you could use&#160;%
 Wontonimo: print( x not in [1,3,5,7,9])
 Overbed: yes sorry thanks
 Stephen20: if number%2 == 1
 Stephen20: checks if the remainder is 1
 Stephen20: which means it's odd
 Overbed: tysm
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I found another Danish movie but I forgot the name, it was good. I have it written somewhere and will try to find it lol
 Overbed: i am dumb
 Overbed: so
 Wontonimo: another way is like this
 Wontonimo: x&#160;!= (x//2)*2
 Scarfield: lol astro, a few keywords, i might know  it
 Scarfield: hey Overbed, you are learning, not dumb&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: being the only mod online is lonely&#160;;(
 Overbed: well Scarfield that might be true but that was just really easy to figure out
 Wontonimo: I just joined the club then the club members left
 Scarfield: how many mods left?
 Scarfield: figuring that stuff out, is an aquired skill mostly i would say. thats why i told you to google, instead of giving that answer straight up
 Wontonimo: 3 in the last 3 days.  xkcd would have something to say about the future trend, and that by this time next year will be at -353 mods
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/605/">https://xkcd.com/605/</a>
 Scarfield: who other than astro?
 Scarfield: lol wonto
 Wontonimo: euler
 Wontonimo: Neuman , Illedan ... okay 4
 Scarfield: has something happened recently, havent been on much
 Scarfield: or contest drama?
 Wontonimo: it's that something hasn't happened.  no multi competition, so lack of engagement i'm guessing
 Wontonimo: i don't really know
 Overbed: ####  #      ######  ## would be pretty easy to just count them up but i need to count them up but only if they are connected so how do i do that i tried googling but didng work
 Overbed: like 4 1 6 2
 Wontonimo: first thing to do is try and do it with pen and paper
 Overbed: what
 Scarfield: yea, this will send a clearer message than the mod strike, but im afraid it wont help
 Wontonimo: come up with a step by step repeatable process that you would do Overbed 
 Overbed: you mean what kind of code?
 Wontonimo: and prove to yourself it would work by writing it down on paper
 Scarfield: ^ great advice
 Overbed: so i create code then write on paper
 Overbed: sorry i dont get it
 Wontonimo: in english (or whatever lang) and then doing it on paper
 Scarfield: find a method, figure out to code method
 Wontonimo: make instructions for a child to do it
 Overbed: why
 Wontonimo: that's how we solve these things&#160;!
 Wontonimo: we are teaching the child (aka computer) to do things, but it is super literal
 Wontonimo: if you can't explain to yourself how to solve the problem you will NOT be able to code a solution
 Overbed: you have to count how much #'s are in the input and then count that up if the #'s are connnected
 Overbed: is this good
 Wontonimo: thanks Scarfield :D
 Overbed: and then print it
 Wontonimo: okay, now, what does it mean that "#" are connected.  break that problem down
 Wontonimo: can you express that in a way that is painfully obvious to translate into if/else code
 Overbed: if the "#" is literally connected or against another "#" without something inbetween like a " "
 Overbed: can i do this with just if/else loops?
 Wontonimo: i can
 Overbed: do you use for loops in this if/else loop?
 Wontonimo: as a reminder a = "hello"print(a[1])will print "e"
 Overbed: let me put this clearer: do you need to use for loops to solf this problem
 Overbed: solve*
 Wontonimo: no
 Overbed: bruh the private coc ended
 Wontonimo: oh, didn't know it was a private Clash
 Wontonimo: let me know next time
 Overbed: why?
 Scarfield: you can use for loops, there is always different ways to solve something. when we are vague in answers, its because we want you to solve it yourself, not because we wanna be rude
 Wontonimo: I will drop everything I'm doing and code it for you so you can advance and collect fake internet ranking
 Scarfield: xD
 Overbed: ..?
 Scarfield: im usually ready to help others learn, i certainly got a lot of help here, and want to pay it forward. but you will not learn anything, if we just give you the answer straight away
 Scarfield: so expect hints, not solutions&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: Kidding aside.  I'm not a fan of clashes and the timed test.  I'd be happy to help a little on puzzles like these codingame.com/training/easy
 Overbed: yes i get that
 Overbed: i get that i dont get the solutions
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Not sending a message, we did that already. Just not actively being part of it since we can't in good conscience
 Astrobytes: Still gonna be aroudn though&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *around
 Astrobytes: and no bitter feelings to anyone either
 Wontonimo: hey Overbed , so here is a solution in pseudo code
 Wontonimo: count = 0for index in range 1 to length(input)-1
 Overbed: what 
 Overbed: is that even python
 Wontonimo: if input[index] == "#" and input[index] == "#" and input[index] == "#" then
 Wontonimo: increase count by 1
 Wontonimo: no,
 Wontonimo: it is pseudo code
 Overbed: oh 
 Scarfield: makes sense Astrobytes, its still a great site, but i wouldnt put in the extra effort either. i didnt even wanna do it ealier :p
 Wontonimo: again, i'm not going to code it for you
 Overbed: yes yes yes
 Wontonimo: does the pseudo code make sense&#160;?
 Overbed: yes it does
 Wontonimo: cool&#160;!
 Wontonimo: glad to see
 Overbed: but idk if it will add " " to the solution tho
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: wdym
 Overbed: the input is ###   ####       ###### and the output must be 3 4 6 then
 Overbed: with spaces inbetween
 Wontonimo: oh, i made a mistake
 Wontonimo: if input[index-1] == "#" and input[index] == "#" and input[index+1] == "#" then
 Overbed: that why i couldnt solve it
 Wontonimo: ah, i see
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: yeah, well we stated our intentions previously, we're people of some integrity and principle so it would be wrong to do otherwise
 Wontonimo: that is a different question than i thought
 Overbed: ah
 Scarfield: its because something inside " " is a string
 Wontonimo: so do you see how the pseudo code i wrote will not solve your problem?
 Astrobytes: (not that I question any other mods integrity lol, a few of us just made our intentions to quit clear previously)
 Overbed: yes
 Wontonimo: okay, the code is very close to doing what it is that you need
 Overbed: well is psuedo code even a language or just to formally like say something
 Wontonimo: give it some think
 Wontonimo: pseudo code is to real code what pseudo diamonds are to diamongs
 Scarfield: oh yea, if you said that, it would be empty words not to own up to them
 Scarfield: im just sad we got here honestly
 Overbed: wontonimo i dont get it
 Overbed: what psuedo code is
 Scarfield: its a way to explain how to code something, without actually coding it
 Wontonimo: thanks Scarfield, i was struggling to find the words
 Overbed: oh like that
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: yeah I know, it is what it is though, nothing we can do
 Scarfield: move to france, apply for job at CG, RIOT!
 Astrobytes: hahaha, lol, I don't wish them any ill
 Scarfield: seriously though, i was surprised so few voiced their concerns with the contest on the forum. we are the &lt;5%
 Astrobytes: there was a lot of dissent on the discord
 Astrobytes: But it was successful enough for CG to pursue so :shrug:
 Wontonimo: and now it isn't really even CG anymore.  it's whatever company bought them
 Astrobytes: Plus with the CoderPad thingy
 Astrobytes: ah yes, Wontonimo is now eulering me
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: (beating me to typing the same/similar answer)
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: I think they started to change direction prior to that, but I guess that was due to ongoing negotiations or plans or whatever. Not my company lol, I wish them luck with it all though
 Scarfield: sure, a business is a business. no animousity from me either, im just getting old and dont like change :p
 Overbed: is learning python for beginners not good in codingame? and if it isnt good can you tell me where to?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i have some links for you... just a sec
 Wontonimo: this is a good ad-free playground <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 Scarfield: this site requires some basic knowleadge, but its great for improving!
 Wontonimo: and here is a walkthrough of common patterns&#160;!  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf">http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf</a>
 Overbed: ahh thats really sorted out for beginners ig
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Scarfield: but as wonto said, the easy puzzle section is better than clashes to learn. no time pressure, and hints for what to know to solve a puzzle
 Wontonimo: a leaning pattern that I've used and i've seen others use is as follows:
 Overbed: i am doing this temprature easy puzzle but its already too hard for me so yeah xd
 Scarfield: 1: steal underpants2: ...3: profit
 Wontonimo: on day 1 , start on the easiest puzzles you can find slowly do more and more complex ones until you run out of free time
 Overbed: well i kinda know for loops and stuff but is that really enough to even complete 1 puzzle?
 Wontonimo: on day 2 and 3 etc , spend half your time redoing the hardest puzzles you've been able to complete
 Overbed: redoing?
 Overbed: why
 Scarfield: Overbed just a tip if you havent noticed. on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures</a> there is the "external ressources" links
 Wontonimo: without using any references or googling or looking at your old answers
 Overbed: ah 
 Overbed: ill do that probably then
 Overbed: overbed on the grind tmrw
 Overbed: i am so funny
 darkhorse64: Win some time, write a MCTS right away and start chatting with other AI freaks
 Overbed: MCTS?
 Scarfield: xD
 darkhorse64: MonteCarlo Tree Search
 Overbed: what the heck is tnat
 Scarfield: a pretty advanced algorithm, that you will be able to do if you keep at it&#160;;)
 Overbed: can you give an example?
 Scarfield: its used to determine a promissing choice/move in a game
 Overbed: basically AI programming?
 Scarfield: yup
 Overbed: aha
 Wontonimo: yeah, it can play games really well.  here is an example of it in action <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/595240196">https://www.codingame.com/replay/595240196</a>
 Overbed: how do you even code that...
 struct: well first you need to sim the game
 struct: sim = simulate
 Scarfield: oi structo
 struct: So you need to write the engine with the rules of the game
 struct: hi Scarfield
 Overbed: yes 
 struct: after having the engine you really only need to implement the mcts
 struct: tutorials make it seem harder than it is
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: it was hard for me 
 Overbed: do you guys know an ez puzzle?
 Overbed: that you think a beginner can solve?
 Scarfield: temperatures is one tbh, or thor
 Overbed: power of thor?
 Wontonimo: if you had trouble with counting "#"s, then no.  Even the 'easy' puzzles here are hard.
 struct: How long have you been programming for Overbed?
 Scarfield: yes überbed
 Overbed: then hackinscience is good to go?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: hahaha
 Wontonimo: are you really dedicated to python?  If would consider javascript then I'd say look up "the coding train" on youtube.  There are fantastic videos there&#160;!
 Wontonimo: they do a lot of intro to programming videos
 GhostCodes: hi
 Scarfield: i love that guy!
 Scarfield: coding train that is xD
 Overbed: struct it's hard to count but if you would say literally i probably have like i think probably something like   15 hours maybe but those hours werent always spent well ig
 Wontonimo: if python is going to be your thing , look for a *free* course online that goes over the very basics&#160;: if/else , loops , arrays , functions
 Wontonimo: possibly just a youtube video
 Overbed: Wontonimo I want to create a game like 2048 by the end of my school year and i thought python would be the best option for it since its ig pretty ez? to learn and it can make a game like that but i really dont know what coding languages can create that
 Overbed: but i think i am far from creating a game rn
 struct: 15 hours is probably to little to start on this website
 Wontonimo: you can probably create one by tomorrow using scratch.mit.edu
 struct: also you can play 2048 here
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048</a>
 Overbed: you can code with python in scratch?
 Wontonimo: here is a video from coding train in how to make tic tac toe.  it has so many of the same pieces as 2048 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA</a>
 struct: you can even look at the source code if you want to check how the author sets the seeds
 Wontonimo: hey struct.  just to put Overbes skill in perspective, they had a hard time turning this string"## ### #####" into this count 2,3,5 
 Overbed: yeah i really suck xd
 Overbed: i couldnt even do it in the end
 struct: well its normal to suck at the start
 struct: you wont learn how to code in 15 hours
 Overbed: but you can create a game in scratch with python?
 struct: I dont know, I never used scratch
 Scarfield: lol
 Overbed: i thought u could only use javascript in scratch
 Scarfield: sure, but isnt javascript better for making games?
 Scarfield: oh i thought you meant "from scratch" xD
 Overbed: is javascript better for making games?
 Scarfield: i dont know, but i think so (?)
 Overbed: can python create fps games and can javascript?
 Scarfield: thats a step up from 2048 :o
 Overbed: lol ik
 Overbed: i dont believe creating something like minecraft or something is easier than creating 2048
 struct: I dont think you need to focus too much on the language
 Astrobytes: have you made text-based games? tic tac toe?
 Overbed: i havent made any games or something
 Scarfield: didnt smitsi make something like that for his students?
 Scarfield: text ttt that is
 Astrobytes: yeah but was a lil more advance iirc
 Astrobytes: *advanced
 Scarfield: ah
 Overbed: but what do you guys think? what coding language should i learn thats easy to learn and you can create 2048 with it?
 Overbed: i cna create it with python
 Overbed: ig
 Astrobytes: I'll be back tomorrow. Have fun all :grin:
 Scarfield: gn&#160;:)
 struct: gn
 Overbed: gn
 struct: both python and js have lots of resources
 Overbed: whats easier to learn
 Overbed: for a newbie
 Scarfield: i would say python, but i dont know js xD
 struct: no idea
 Overbed: Scarfield do you do C# or python cz how did you learn to program 
 Overbed: i have a very hard time deciding how to learn python
 Scarfield: i had a 3 week course of python during my education. started CG, then learned c++ for faster computation
 Overbed: how did you learn python just problems to solve or someone just saying the different functions for things and then solving problems?
 Overbed: i have no teacher so i need to learn it with google
 Scarfield: got explained one simple subject at a time; for loop, list, etc. then had assignments where more and more where needed to solve them
 Overbed: did the teachers make the puzzles?
 Scarfield: yes, i found CG after finishing because i wanted to learn more
 Overbed: how much experience did you have when joining CG
 Scarfield: python or javascript i cant tell you honestly. from the videoes i have seen on youtube bu creators making games, javascript is much more used. but the link wonto gave you ealier is good for learning the basics, and you can definately find a good video on youtube to get aquainted with the basics of any language&#160;:)
 Overbed: is coding fun when you are very good at it
 Scarfield: 2 weeks teaching, 1 week of writing the exam script
 Overbed: education = universe or what
 Overbed: was it a course at a universe
 Scarfield: yup
 Overbed: you see i am only 13
 DialFrost: morning!
 Scarfield: if you have the interest, you can definately do it, there are younger people on here
 Overbed: only a select few of people are allowed to do something called "prisma project" where you select something that you want to learn thru the time of the year and its lame how we all have to figure it out ourselves and there aint nobody to help us or something
 Overbed: its also lame how most of the people just use it to learn spanish or something in my opinion
 Overbed: but our school is a pretty high level ig so they expect way too much from us
 Scarfield: there is a teacher from netherlands on here, his nickname is Msmits, he will surely help you, if you see him on here, make sure to ask him&#160;:)
 Overbed: how old is he?
 Scarfield: hmm
 Scarfield: 40-50 maybe, i dont know
 Overbed: whattttt he is 23rd??????????
 Scarfield: yup
 Overbed: he does C# the most but he also does python 3
 Overbed: aha 
 Overbed: when is he mostly online?
 Scarfield: he teaches python
 Overbed: oh
 Overbed: for free?
 Scarfield: not this late, but during the afternoon
 Scarfield: as a teacher on a highschool, teaching python among other things
 Overbed: so he works at a college there? wow cool i didnt think the Netherlands would have colleges there just teaching computer stuff
 Overbed: idk why i thinked that
 Scarfield: they dont i think, its just one of the subjects he teaches as far as i know
 Overbed: oh
 Scarfield: but he is very skilled, a good teacher, and speaks your language&#160;:)
 Overbed: whats the thing called for colleges that teach something like engineering?
 Overbed: there are bachelors in the netherlands where you can learn computer science 
 Overbed: can you even go to 1 if you dont have a lot of experience?
 struct: universities?
 Scarfield: i have no idea, i just know he teaches python
 Overbed: universities yes
 struct: i dont know what system the Netherlands uses
 struct: I dont know it is over there
 struct: but here you dont need a lot of experience
 Overbed: wow there is literally one in my city
 Overbed: cool ig
 Overbed: maybe if i am interested i might go there in a few years
 Overbed: Print the 10 first square number, one per line.
 Overbed: what does this mean?
 struct: print from 1 to 10 all the square numbers
 struct: so 1*1
 struct: 2*2
 struct: 3*3
 struct: and so on
 Scarfield: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2.. dammit
 Scarfield: anyway im off, gn folks&#160;:)
 struct: gn
 Overbed: oh like that thats ez
 Overbed: gn
 Overbed: i see alot of people use something like:
 Overbed: import watuawutahthuat
 Overbed: but here i used from math import functional
 struct: they are called packages 
 Overbed: yes but are there different ways of importing them?
 struct: the way you showed will only import functional I think
 struct: instead of everything in math
 Overbed: import math
 struct: yes
 Overbed: would import everything in the package math?
 struct: i think so
 Overbed: how do you download such packages
 struct: im sure google can answer that better than me
 struct: "how to install packages in python"
 Overbed: thats probably true
 Flaise: How about the "pip" package manager
 Overbed: radius = 6.283185307179586def circle_perimeter(radius):
 Overbed: returns 100
 Overbed: if it is circle_perimeter(100)
 Overbed: how to fix this 
 IamFish: huh?
 Overbed: i really dont know
 IamFish: call the global variable radius
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/641546c7-33d8-4f42-a5fa-ce5ef5f75b38">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/641546c7-33d8-4f42-a5fa-ce5ef5f75b38</a>
 Overbed: wdym
 Stormyy: lol
 Stormyy: what are you trying to do
 Overbed: hackinscience puzzle
 IamFish: the variable you store your radius in (6.28...) is overwritten by the radius inside your function
 Stormyy: ^
 Overbed: how do i fix that
 IamFish: don't use the same name for the two variables
 Stormyy: change variable names
 Overbed: what
 Stormyy: ..
 IamFish: call the first variable r or something
 IamFish: instead of radius
 Overbed: ahh i got this and it worked
 Overbed: r = 6.283185307179586def circle_perimeter(radiu):
 Stormyy: yes
 Stormyy: you can keep the name radius though
 IamFish: is that how you calculate a perimeter though? perimeter is just the circumference right?
 Stormyy: yes
 Stormyy: i dont think thats how you calculate perimeter
 Overbed: well
 Overbed: idk
 Stormyy: its r^2*PI
 Overbed: it was the puzzle
 Stormyy: that wouldbe the radius
 Stormyy: i mean
 Stormyy: the circumference
 IamFish: yeah, according to the puzzle just multiplying it is the right way so idk lol
 Stormyy: also is it just me or does r look like tau
 Overbed: ight imma go to sleep
 Overbed: gn yall
 IamFish: nighty
 Stormyy: oh TAU*r works as well
 Stormyy: you're correct
 Stormyy: gn lol
 IamFish: ooooh lmao
 IamFish: 2*pi hahah
 Stormyy: yeah lol
 pardouin: there are 4 different ways to import something
 pardouin: import math... math.pi
 pardouin: from math iimport pi... pi
 pardouin: from math import *... pi
 pardouin: import math as m... m.pi
 IamFish: from math import pi as p
 IamFish: 5th one
 pardouin: ^^
 pardouin: yes it works, just tested it
 e_fishel: hello
 IamFish: yeah, i'm a bit of a prodigy8)
 IamFish: ello
 pardouin: can be useful whe you import somthing like combinations_with_replacement
 Stormyy: yes
 Stormyy: i have no clue how python works
 Wontonimo: hey struct, what have you been working on lately?
 sneezydrag0n: hey Wontonimo, you there?
 Wontonimo: ah, i'm back
 LelouchVC2: Struct is here?
 Wontonimo: sneezydrag0n , what up?
 LelouchVC2: struct&#160;! friend ol' pal!
 quasi_ubique: I'm working on a code golf problem, but ruby lang is removing leading zeros from a binary number, causing me to get a wrong answer.
 ZXC01: Unary?
 LelouchVC2: yea, code golf is stupid sometimes
 quasi_ubique: Yeah
 ZXC01: o
 quasi_ubique: 37 in binary is 100101 but also 00100101
 quasi_ubique:&#160;:/
 Jerrasterix: make it a string and add leading zeros
 Jerrasterix: That's something every language will do 
 Jerrasterix: not just ruby
 quasi_ubique: Should I make them all 8 digits long? I'm not sure how much is should do
 .Nickname: 8 binary digits is a maximum base-10 value of 256
 Jerrasterix: what does the question say&#160;??
 .Nickname: if that is sufficient, then yes
 .Nickname: 11111111 == 256
 quasi_ubique: Problem is here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris-codesize">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris-codesize</a> Will try with 8 digits then
 Jerrasterix: for chuck norris, it need be a 7bit binary 
 Jerrasterix: so check if your string length is 7 
 quasi_ubique: It was 6 digits, that
 quasi_ubique: that's why I was confused
 Jerrasterix: if not add (7-length) times '0'
 quasi_ubique: Thanks all, I should've looked closer to see it said 7 bit ascii. Padding fixed it.
 Flaise: Hey, anyone know how to code in Go? I'm having trouble figuring out how one would instantiate a heterogeneous collection.
 Flaise: I'm using the built-in List object and the compiler is telling me I add and remove elements of type interface{} so is that kind of like Object in C#/Java?
 Flaise: er, wait.. I figured it out. My code that was supposed to be adding the objects wasn't. lol
 Wontonimo: you are a wizard Flaise&#160;!  wiggle those coding fingers
 Flaise: :P
 Flaise: Got one more language to do before I get the legend achievement
 Wontonimo: and it will be your first legend achievement
 Flaise: Yep. Gonna get a little popout notification. "Achievement Unlocked: Can't make up your damn mind!"
 Wontonimo: you want a totally new lang?
 Wontonimo: or do you need one more puzzle in c++&#160;?
 Flaise: I used to language-hop so much years ago. Now I've settled on a few.
 Wontonimo: you know it can be the same puzzle and get credit for different langs
 Flaise: I need several more in C++ for that achievement. My next puzzle will be a language I haven't done yet. Probably F#.
 Jerrasterix: C based languages&#160;??
 Wontonimo: he's done them all
 Flaise: Yeah, I did that with the Horse Dual thing because I left behind an achievement that wanted me to use Bash, of all things. o_O
 Jerrasterix: yeah, I saw that, just asking if he settled for C based langs
 Jerrasterix: I didn't type out the full question :P
 Jerrasterix: silly me
 Wontonimo: you can use bash to paste your c++ solution to a file and then compile and run that file
 Wontonimo: that's what i did
 Jerrasterix: you did C# right&#160;??
 Flaise: I think the languages that originated indirectly from C are the most useful, generally. And Python. Python is nice to code in.
 Jerrasterix: then VB.NET 
 Flaise: Wontonimo: Did you really? xD
 Jerrasterix: can we do that C# too&#160;??
 Flaise: I'm thinking I'm going to use F# as the last language for the achievement
 Wontonimo: yeah, westicles got me onto that sort of thing for those oddball languages
 Wontonimo: he's made a commandline callout for every language
 Flaise: Isn't D a C-based language?
 Jerrasterix: yeah 
 Jerrasterix: you could do D
 Wontonimo: that's how he has 570+ puzzles solved in every language.
 LelouchVC2: How many Ds we talkin here
 Jerrasterix: if you C++, its just a walk in a different park
 Flaise: lol I guess automation is better than doing stuff by hand... o_O
 Flaise: I've never used D actually. One of the few big languages I haven't touched.
 Flaise: The low level languages have always felt a tad intimidating before I started Rust.
 Jerrasterix: That's low level language... 
 Jerrasterix: :wink:
 Jerrasterix: wait 570+ puzzles :astonished:

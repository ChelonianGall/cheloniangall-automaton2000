 Wontonimo: cool Cegwe, how did you do it?
 Wontonimo: generally speaking, i'm not asking for exact code
 Cegwe: I used a bias towards the middle of the board, and made the bot find the space where it was adjacent to the most 2 in a row places at the same time (favoring blocking over anything)
 Cegwe: It took a lot of tweaking and tinkering but I was happy with the result
 Cegwe: The bias was super small by the way, it was only for tie breakers
 Wontonimo: nice.  my bot is MCTS with scoring based on win/loss (not point difference), so it gives up easily and doesn't really try to crush the enemy when winning
 Cegwe: I didn't even think to take point difference into account, maybe I could take the lead if I did
 Wontonimo: i think i'll next try UCT with scoring as the valuation
 Wontonimo: maybe some local sim to find those kinds of bias and constants you found manually.
 Cegwe: I'm wondering if the time given for input is enough to go deeper than one layer of play? It would be cool to simulate the best course of action in a higher depth
 Cegwe: I'm not really experienced in any botting at all, so this game was super fun to figure out
 Wontonimo: i'm simulating something crazy like 100K playouts, but the selection space is greatly pruned down to about10 moves
 ProCoder03: You guys already wrote a sim :confused:, why am I not able to write sims :sob:
 Cegwe: Wow
 Cegwe: I'm only looking at one layer lol
 Wontonimo: i think that is something that is killing my bot, 10 moves out of 100 is too agressive 
 Wontonimo: yeah, and you are beating me&#160;!
 Wontonimo: heuristic beats brute force in this game!
 Cegwe: I bet if you work on that though you'd be at #1
 Wontonimo: maybe.  i'm thinking this would be a good game for NN
 Wontonimo: conv NN
 Cegwe: probably; can you make good NNs on this site? I can't think of a way to make it viable without some sort of file saving
 Cegwe: I'd love to give it a shot but I don't even know where to start to be honest - I'm super new to this site and only really started playing a week or two ago
 ProCoder03: you have some article about it in codingame.com/learn
 Cegwe: Oh sweet I'll take a look
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 Wontonimo: a wonderful contribution by Marchete
 Cegwe: oh sweet
 ProCoder03: geez, I just overshot this while searching 
 Wontonimo: I haven't implemented it yet, but several people here have.  It is a monster of an undertaking if you haven't written a local sim before
 Cegwe: lol going to try to adapt this into my langauge of choice
 Wontonimo: my job is NN, machine learning and data science, and I'm passing on it for now (because of the amount of work involved)
 Cegwe: yeah I've tried before and it's pretty awful, but I don't work in any computer related field so I don't get so tired of it as quickly as many others do
 Cegwe: I feel like keeping this as a hobby instead of a job has helped me keep it fun
 Wontonimo: i do both :D
 Cegwe: That's pretty awesome
 Wontonimo: I'm working on automating an unfolding clicker game right now, a reverse engineering and automation challenge
 ProCoder03: did derjack screw his MCTS&#160;?? 
 Cegwe: can you link it?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/">https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/</a>
 Cegwe: ooh this game
 Cegwe: i know this one
 Wontonimo: how far have you gotten?
 Cegwe: not tooooo far
 Cegwe: although my save disapeered
 Cegwe: I actually don't remember it's been a while
 Wontonimo: black hole reset?
 Wontonimo: bioseeding?
 Cegwe: doubt it on bioseeding doesn't ring a bell
 Wontonimo: ah, then you only scratched the surface
 Cegwe: yeah, I have a hard time with resource management games
 Wontonimo: it's an optimization problem
 Cegwe: for sure
 Wontonimo: hint, go for population growth before anything else
 Cegwe: are you trying to make it go the fastest?
 Cegwe: the automation?
 Cegwe: the only type of game like that I ever got far in was trimps
 Wontonimo: funny you should say that, a good friend of mine has a similar opinion
 Cegwe: Well it was the first one I tried, and since then none of the other ones have really pulled me in like trimps did
 Cegwe: Do you have any recommendation on which bot competition I should do next? I want something a little harder, but some of those competitions look way too complex for me
 ProCoder03: What have you done yet&#160;??
 Cegwe: counting tictactoe was the one I worked on today, but its not approved yet; I did some of the pod racing one, but didn't really like that one by the time I got to bronze league
 Cegwe: That's all so far
 ProCoder03: try UTTT
 Wontonimo: there is a concept called PID controllers that works really well on Coders strikes back and the mars lander stuff
 Wontonimo: as far as other challenges ... I had a lot of fun with Tron
 Cegwe: ill give uttt a try; I would get into looking at PID but i dont really like the coders strikes back challenge anyways
 ProCoder03: Tron uses 2D arrays and DFS, right&#160;??
 Cegwe: I'll give tron a try too
 Wontonimo: UTTT (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe) was my first attempt at MCTS here on CG.  For that it is kinda special to me
 Cegwe: maybe ill try one too? I've never implemented that before
 Wontonimo: Tron was fun because I got really far using just floodfill
 Cegwe: Do you have an article on mcts? I don't really know how it works
 Wontonimo: and the pacman game was fun because I got pretty far in that using something like floodfill, more more like "diffusing  smell"
 Wontonimo: just a sec.  i'll get you something
 Cegwe: Thank you
 Cegwe: Also what's floodfill? I keep seeing mentioned, but don't really know what it means
 Wontonimo: this video has great content (not the best video production) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a>
 Cegwe: Thank you!
 ProCoder03: wait isn't it MCTS Wontonimo
 ProCoder03: the link
 Cegwe: its a video by a 'john levine'
 Wontonimo: it explains MCTS applied to a situation that is NOT adversarial.   To make it adversarial, you need to flip the value of the backprop as it goes up the tree 
 ProCoder03: so MCTS and flood fill are similar&#160;??
 Wontonimo: i was talking about mcts.  hadn't got to flood fill yet
 ProCoder03: Ohh... my bad 
 Wontonimo: np :D
 Wontonimo: here is a puzzle about flood fill <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/flood-fill-example">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/flood-fill-example</a>
 Cegwe: so would i just use recursion for it? that seems like the most immediate way to go about it, but I obviously don't know if it's actually any good
 Wontonimo: it's really good for calculating areas of control
 Cegwe: ooooh floodfill is like the a* pathfinding thing
 Wontonimo: kinda
 Wontonimo: but yeah, very related 
 ProCoder03: Do we need to know pathfinding algo to understand floodfill&#160;??
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: you can use floodfill to accomplish lots of things.
 Wontonimo: for example, in mars lander 3 I use it to make a scoring gradient from the landing pad.  The floodfill
 Wontonimo: in this case also increments as it fills, 
 Cegwe: makes sense to me
 Wontonimo: so my lander can at any time lookup the floodfill 2d array and get a distance from the landing pad, even around corners
 Cegwe: But the mcts is still a bit confusing, I think I'll need to play with it to understand it
 miszu: one thing I don't understand if when I put a seed in IDE and print the grid... then do the exact same thing in visual studio and print the grid, I get two different thing
 Wontonimo: hmm , don't know about that miszu
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0aab8d9f-de02-4b42-8a88-bf6fc6ba34b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0aab8d9f-de02-4b42-8a88-bf6fc6ba34b1</a>
 Wontonimo: okay, Cegwe, are you familiar with minimax&#160;?
 Cegwe: yes
 miszu: same code in ide and visual studio yet different results
 Cegwe: maybe this ide or visual studio applies their own modifier to your value, or maybe it runs a different version or something
 Wontonimo: so, imagine minimax, and instead of evaluating ALL of the next level at the same time, you evaluate only the most promising 1 branch
 Cegwe: ok but sometimes isnt that a fluke?
 Cegwe: like it seems pretty good, but not fantastic
 Wontonimo: it is, and by evaluating that 1 branch you get more insight into how good/bad it is
 Cegwe: oh I see
 Wontonimo: now there are two terms that control this,
 Cegwe: ok and if its bad you just choose the next best one I assume?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: right ... but ...
 Wontonimo: if you've only looked at the first layer, then you really don't have much confidence in any of them
 Cegwe: ok
 Cegwe: so how many layers should I look at before switching to mcts?
 Wontonimo: once you expand one of those , you have 2 data points at that top for that 1 branch
 Wontonimo: but only 1 data point for all the others
 Wontonimo: and you can calculate the uncertainty using probability theory
 Cegwe: omg statistic rip
 Wontonimo: so, even if that expand was by fluke great, you reduce the uncertainty of that branch ... and the other branches now look more interesting, because their value plus their uncertainty puts them higher than thee one you explored
 Cegwe: Oh okay, so do you just use some threshold to decide when the outcome is good enough?
 Wontonimo: this is all controlled with UCB1 eval equation that someeone clever already solved and it's in the video
 Cegwe: yeah i saw that
 Wontonimo: some people call it the "exploration term"
 Wontonimo: it's the second half of the UCB1 evaluation
 Wontonimo: the first half is just average reward
 Cegwe: Man this is going to be a whole project for tomorrow
 Cegwe: Maybe I'll try putting this into the counting tictactoe game although idk if that'd be worth it
 ProCoder03: So Minimax is just MCTS, but instead of exploring the promising one, you explore all the possibilities. Am I right&#160;??
 Cegwe: I'll probably try it on something new
 Wontonimo: it took me 4 weeks, 30 hours a week to write my UTTT bot.  Maybe I'm slow.  it was also the first time in over 25 years that I coded c++
 Cegwe: Man that must be wild
 Cegwe: Imma try to do it in java, it'll probably take me equally long if not longer
 ProCoder03: well if you know Flat MC and basic trees, It was easy.... 
 Wontonimo: 2 words&#160;: unit tests
 ProCoder03: not too easy, took me 14 hrs to debug and make it work properly 
 Cegwe: I still have to figure out exactly whats going on with mcts anyways - you and that video definitely helped but i still feel miles away from true understanding
 Wontonimo: i used bitboarding for uttt.  it's a must if you are using MCTS
 Cegwe: bitboarding?
 Cegwe: oh gosh more stuff I've never heard of
 Wontonimo: yeah, say you are just playing TTT, plain 3x3 TTT
 Wontonimo: and you need to save the game board
 Wontonimo: 2 players, 9 squares, 3 states per square
 Wontonimo: how would you store that info?
 Cegwe: array with 1 for x, 2 for o, 0 for empty, and then i'd do a seperate variable with whose turn it was
 Cegwe: in a file it would probably look like aXEOEXEEEO
 Cegwe: a being the first player(X), and E being empty
 Cegwe: that's how id do it
 Wontonimo: okay.  now how we check to see if one player has just placed a move that wins, we would iterate over the horizontal, the vertical and the two diagonals
 Wontonimo: right?
 Cegwe: yeah
 Wontonimo: 8 iterations, with 3 lookups into the array per iteration
 Wontonimo: for 8x3 accesses of the array
 Wontonimo: okay,
 Wontonimo: what if instead
 Wontonimo: we stored each players owned positions in 1 int, in the bytes of the int
 Cegwe: how do you mean?
 Wontonimo: so, if player 1 has no squares then we would store that as 1 int like so0b000000000
 Cegwe: oh ok
 Wontonimo: and if that player owned the centre, then like so0b000010000
 Wontonimo: and we do the same for the other player
 Cegwe: oh i get where this is going i think
 Wontonimo: now, there are 512 possible configurations of 9 bits
 Wontonimo: and you can make a table of which configurations are winning configurations
 Wontonimo: and in ... wait for it ....
 Wontonimo: ONE lookup you can know if the player won
 Wontonimo: that's a lot faster than 8x3 in a loop
 Cegwe: that's true
 Wontonimo: it isn't 24x faster
 Wontonimo: it is a lot more than that
 Cegwe: can you use a seperate file to store those winning positions on this website? or would you have to messily leave that in the code somewhere?
 Wontonimo: because the loop has a branch, and branches are actually pretty expensive
 Wontonimo: you can calculate it once at the startup of your code and build the 512 values in 1 millisecond
 Cegwe: oh i see 
 Cegwe: i didnt think about having the code do it
 Cegwe: that makes a lot more sense
 Wontonimo: for UTTT, my code uses 9 mini 3x3 boards.  each mini 3x3 board uses the above technique
 Wontonimo: another example of how this is a benefit ,
 Wontonimo: say you want to calculate all remaining valid moves
 Wontonimo: playerA has some value like 0b10010000
 Wontonimo: and playerB has maybe 0b000010000
 Wontonimo: the valid moves that remain is
 Wontonimo: 0b111111111 ^ (playerA | playerB)
 Wontonimo: in 2 operations you've calculated all the remaining valid positions
 Wontonimo: I was slightly aware of this concept before UTTT, but I really didn't have a good appreciation of how much it optimizes code.
 ProCoder03: Wontonimo: A small doubt, so Minimax is just MCTS, but instead of exploring the promising one, you explore all the possibilities. Am I right&#160;??
 ProCoder03: and one more, how do we sense the heading direction of Tron&#160;??
 Wontonimo: i guess.  If the exploration constant in MCTS is high enough, it will act very much like Minimax.
 Wontonimo: but probably not as efficient as minimax
 ProCoder03: so Minimax is effective than MCTS, though a time consuming algo&#160;??
 Wontonimo: hmm ... there is a difference between MCTS and a UCT with eval.  MCTS is a special case of UCT (upper confidence Tree) where the eval is a random playout.
 TechnoBot: Hi&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: you can sub in some other eval for a random playout, then MCTS becomes a UCT with eval.  Minimax usually has an eval, so it is more like UCT 
 TechnoBot:&#160;??????
 Wontonimo: hi TechnoBot
 TechnoBot: HI Wontonimo
 ProCoder03: what's UCT&#160;?? 
 ProCoder03: is it like UCB1&#160;??
 TechnoBot: Bruh
 TechnoBot: NO ITS NOT
 ProCoder03: then&#160;??
 TechnoBot: ITS not a UCB
 Wontonimo: UCB1 is the equation for directing expansion
 TechnoBot: Ill tell you after u play Coders Strike back
 TechnoBot: what a UCT is
 TechnoBot: JOIN
 ProCoder03: I am already in gold in it 
 Wontonimo: you can use another equation, there are plenty.  UCB1 is just the most famous atm
 Wontonimo: what rank have you reached in CSB TechnoBot&#160;?
 ProCoder03: okay, but What is acronym of UCT&#160;??
 Wontonimo: Upper Confidence Tree
 Wontonimo: that's the Tree part of MCTS
 Wontonimo: MC = Monte Carlo, TS = Tree Search
 ProCoder03: Which part, the rolling part&#160;??
 Wontonimo: the tree search is the UCT that is in MCTS
 Wontonimo: the tree in MCTS is an UCT
 Wontonimo: back to TechnoBot, what's your rank in Coders Strikes Back?
 Wontonimo: have you implemented a PID controller?
 TechnoBot: Hey lets see who can finish Coders Stroke Back First. Beat me and I'll tell you something You Don't Know
 Cegwe: dangi t
 Cegwe: my internet timed out
 Cegwe: i hate this shitty internet but its the only decent provider around here
 Wontonimo: okay, you are on TechnoBot
 ProCoder03: well as per that guy in video, He told MCTS has 4 parts - Selection, Expansion, Rollout and Backpropagate, I implemented MCTS according to it... So can you point what part is UCT Wontonimo&#160;??
 Wontonimo: the whole tree.  that thing you expand and select from
 ProCoder03: The Tree which I select and expand is called UCT ah..&#160;??
 Wontonimo: I'm a little ahead of you TechnoBot, try harder
 Wontonimo: yeah ProCoder03, you got it!
 TechnoBot: BRUH
 ProCoder03: you call that little ahead humphh&#160;??
 Wontonimo: if you want I can push your pod at little faster 
 Wontonimo: but seriously TechnoBot, would you like a hint&#160;?
 TechnoBot: Nope.
 Wontonimo: cool
 TechnoBot: But I'm just gonna push it back a bit lol
 TechnoBot: I'm gonna beat you at the last second or rather the last 0.1 sec
 TechnoBot: :smirk:
 TechnoBot: Done.
 TechnoBot: I finished lol
 TechnoBot: :D
 Cegwe: yay my internet started working again
 TechnoBot: Cegwe's internet is bad
 TechnoBot: LOL
 Cegwe: facts
 SimonLandry: Ditch the wifi
 SimonLandry: that might help
 TechnoBot: Yeah
 TechnoBot: My bot wifi is The BEST
 TechnoBot: It has a password tho

 Wontonimo: congrats miszu&#160;!
 TechnoBot: Wontinimo
 Wontonimo: are you using a beam search?
 TechnoBot: BRUH
 Wontonimo: that's the second time you use that word.  i don't think it means what you think it means
 TechnoBot: I just finished
 TechnoBot: LOL
 TechnoBot: Are you still racing?
 TechnoBot: HAHAHAHAHA Bruh man]
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: miszu , are you using a beam search for 2048?
 TechnoBot: did you finish
 TechnoBot: CODERS STRKE BACK
 TechnoBot: EH
 TechnoBot:&#160;?
 ProCoder03: he isn't racing, but his bot is&#160;!!
 Cegwe: oh gosh now i gotta look up what beam search is 
 Wontonimo: oh, i made a bot for coders strikes back, yeah
 Cegwe: all this stuff and information
 TechnoBot: Hey im the bot
 TechnoBot: I am controlling my computer
 TechnoBot: cause I am the computer
 TechnoBot: HAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!
 TechnoBot: BTW Wontinimo DID NOT MAKE ME
 Wontonimo: beam search is very much like breath first search, except you only keep the last X number of promising items, and you expand the one that looks the most promising first
 Cegwe: oh ok
 TechnoBot: Bruh
 TechnoBot: 𝓑𝓡𝓤𝓗
 Cegwe: that was actually immediately understandable for once
 ProCoder03: BFS and DFS are like MCTS&#160;??
 TechnoBot: 𝓑𝓡𝓤𝓗
 TechnoBot: That is so easy
 Cegwe: Imma try to implement my own version of that without looking anything up
 TechnoBot: Hey Wontinimo, What place are you in the race
 Wontonimo: no, bfs and dfs are not like mcts.
 TechnoBot: WONTINIMO
 TechnoBot: WHAT PLACE ARE YOU IN THE RACE
 Wontonimo: 78th
 TechnoBot: Ok,
 Wontonimo: don't shout
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS has some parallels with DFS: you fully expand a path to the end and then go back up
 TechnoBot: Im 83th
 TechnoBot: and
 TechnoBot: a promise is a promise
 eulerscheZahl: but you don't explore the other paths immediately. you don't even necessarily explore the whole tree
 TechnoBot: Wontinimo
 eulerscheZahl: and you are more careful when it comes to selecting the node you expand next

 TechnoBot: Cause I'm an iMac
 ProCoder03: nahh... I saw his when he was at the last of leaderboard..
 Wontonimo: try reloading the default code using the circle arrow in thee upper right hand corner TechnoBot (i'm not trolling)
 ProCoder03: It was not a guess, it was his previous rank 
 Wontonimo: your current code is crashing your bot
 TechnoBot: ok
 TechnoBot: I think you mean Upper left corner
 Wontonimo: the error message is that your code timed out.  you probably have an if statement around your final print, and when it is false you don't print anything
 Wontonimo: no, upper right, in the coding game IDE

 d33pb1ue: because my program times out
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if you ask the right question to get the answer you want
 eulerscheZahl: do you want a power modulo something for instance?
 d33pb1ue: So I mean when doing a**b, but with bigger numbers like 2*13786 which takes too long
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm pretty sure you don't even want the actual result
 eulerscheZahl: just tell us what you really need
 d33pb1ue: What do you mean I don't want the actual result
 eulerscheZahl: do you want to compute the power just to have it? or do something with it? maybe you can do the second without the first
 d33pb1ue: I want the first 3 digits of the result
 eulerscheZahl: i see. sounds like you can compute a logarithm then
 d33pb1ue: What are logarithms?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/89403/is-there-a-way-to-find-the-first-digits-of-a-number">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/89403/is-there-a-way-to-find-the-first-digits-of-a-number</a>
 d33pb1ue: Thank you!
 eulerscheZahl: the logarithm is a math function, you'll learn that in higher grades at school
 eulerscheZahl: see it as an inverse of the exponential
 Thyl: Who will do SnackDown&#160;???
 Badea: Hi, I have a question, is there a way of obtaining all clash of code problem statements?
 <b>**TheBlueBias drop his Twix on the floor.</b></p><p><img src="/a/71042767029501" /> TheBlueBias: Done Thyl.
 eulerscheZahl: do you want to solve them all in advance Badea? there are more than 1000 clashes
 eulerscheZahl: I count 1415, but some of them are already removed now because of poor rating
 Badea: Yea I want to practice on them, maybe translate them in my language for those who are not so good with english.
 MiyamuraIzumi: How to have a girl friend?
 jacek: not on this website
 TheBlueBias: Code one
 MiyamuraIzumi: haha
 MiyamuraIzumi: how do I start to code a girl friend?
 MiyamuraIzumi: google doesn't have the answer for this
 thealmightyjason: thats pathetic
 TheBlueBias: An over-complicated opening book would be a godd start.
 TheBlueBias: *good
 MiyamuraIzumi: can opening book be randomness
 MiyamuraIzumi: she should be interactive and randomness
 MiyamuraIzumi: still which algorithm should I use?
 DoubleOracle: is it actually possible to create a whitelist or blacklist to filter chat?
 struct: DoubleOracle you can put ?disableChat
 struct: to the end of the url
 struct: or do you mean block someone in the chat?
 DoubleOracle: Thanks for the tip - I was more thinking about filtering really than disabling
 DoubleOracle: could be users, keywords
 DoubleOracle: But I guess I could do that on discord?
 struct: yeah you cant do that here
 struct: No idea if you can do it on discord
 DoubleOracle: I was somehow assuming that the world chat is mirrored on discord - but I don't find the corresponding channel
 DoubleOracle: So I assume it is not mirrored?
 eulerscheZahl: completely different chats
 eulerscheZahl: this one is older than discord
 DoubleOracle: I see
 DoubleOracle: thanks for clarifying
 ProCoder03: will this work num&amp;1^1 if I want to check if num is even or not&#160;??
 ProCoder03: and will it be the fastest way to check if something is even or not&#160;??
 antiwonto: num&amp;1
 struct: n&amp;1 yes
 jacek: its faster <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even">https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even</a>
 eulerscheZahl: dependencies: 1 (is-odd)
 ProCoder03: :laughing: I just saw it now, using is-odd for is-even
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: 😆
 eulerscheZahl: over-engineered code, as I only wrote it for homework at programming classes
 eulerscheZahl: there is also this package: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-zero">https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-zero</a>
 jacek: but no dependencies
 jacek: isPositiveZero mhm
 eulerscheZahl: when you look at the code, it even does something
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/i-voted-for-trump/is-odd/blob/master/test.js">https://github.com/i-voted-for-trump/is-odd/blob/master/test.js</a>
 eulerscheZahl: wait, wrong link
 jacek: i-voted-for-trump
 eulerscheZahl: that username

 jacek: argh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ten-thousand">https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ten-thousand</a>
 eulerscheZahl: of course someone who thinks it's a good idea to release an is-odd package also votes for Trump. makes total sense
 jacek: and its dependencies
 jacek: finally something worthy for discord memes

 MiyamuraIzumi: so I see why it need a package now
 eulerscheZahl: maybe some see it as a way to tell "see what I did". like having a commit in the Linux kernel
 jacek: or having clash played
 Thyl: In a minimax, If i explore at depth 9 a branch and 4 antother, the 9 branch is sure
 jacek: hm?
 AntiSquid: maybe you refer to alpha beta pruning thyl, but not sure what you try to say
 Thyl: I want to cut a branc if it get a lot of time
 jacek: iterative deepening?
 Thyl: jacek is it aproximally
 eulerscheZahl: sounds a bit like A*
 eulerscheZahl: there you also have some paths that are more explored than others
 Thyl: no
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Thyl: if in the exploration the time for the exploration is big stop the search
 eulerscheZahl: is there are reason not to use iterative deepening then?
 Thyl: yes
 Thyl: the complexity of Iterative deepening is O (n+n+1+n+2+n+3...)
 Thyl: with my code it will be in theory :P 
 Thyl: O(N)
 tangugu: Where can I see the answer
 jacek: umm complexity of iterative deepening is still O of the original search
 Thyl: eulerscheZahl do you understand
 Thyl:&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, had a private message about 2048 simulation open
 Thyl: jacek
 eulerscheZahl: look how the tree explodes. even if you only have 2 moves each turn, the node size always doubles
 Thyl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: of course you do double work with iterative deepening. but it's really minor, wasting a few milliseconds when the next layer can easily take a second
 Thyl: ok
 Thyl: thx!
 eulerscheZahl: add alpha-beta if you haven't already. that one is a big game-changer. combine with some move ordering if possible
 Thyl: I did it
 Thyl: in oware I am ~ 28
 Thyl: I searchto  optimize
 eulerscheZahl: i'm at 27 :P
 Thyl: Yes
 Thyl: I know
 eulerscheZahl: i had to look it up
 Thyl: but you have a MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: i think i have a minimax too
 Thyl: ooo
 Thyl: I kinow
 Thyl: When my last Iterative deepening work
 eulerscheZahl: yes, negamax with iterative deepening and alpha-beta pruning
 Thyl: eulerscheZahl with an old code&#160;:
 Thyl: 5 minutes to read
 Thyl: And He know the code function&#160;;)
 Thyl: GG&#160;!
 Thyl: negamax is the same of minimax
 Thyl:&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: yes, just a different way to implement it
 TheBlueBias: Just code optimization.
 TheBlueBias: You can try to add killermoves in your ID Thyl.
 eulerscheZahl: looking at my code, I didn't really try to optimize anything
 eulerscheZahl: 237 lines, mostly reused from my checkers bot. and a slow simulation
 struct: Optimization is not worth
 eulerscheZahl: copying the state array at each expansion step
 Thyl: with my minimax sometimes with ID I go to depth 14
 eulerscheZahl: i get somewhere in the range of 150k-200k nodes that I visit
 jacek: my 'depth' isnt comparable as i use best-first rather than brute-forcing
 jacek: do you have smart eval?
 eulerscheZahl: is that some special vocabulary I should know?
 jacek: i bet its from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.joansala.com/auale/strategy/en/">http://www.joansala.com/auale/strategy/en/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: found a scoring on some website, fail to find it again
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that's it :D
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Hello
 Thyl: I think I have a stuck eval
 Thyl: I want to implement a hash function
 Thyl: a or an hash funtion&#160;???
 JData31: "a"
 Thyl: sorry french accent
 JData31: Wee
 Thyl: in french H isn't speak
 TheBlueBias: Parmentier is a good hash.
 Scarfield: in french you dont pronounce "s" as last letter right? so "hash" would just be "a"?
 Thyl: yes
 TheBlueBias: No
 Scarfield: xD
 TheBlueBias: sh is pronounced...
 Thyl: it's the same hash or ash
 TheBlueBias: Scashfield
 Scarfield: LeBlueBia
 Thyl: yes
 jacek: i live in spain. the s is silent
 Scarfield: lol
 Thyl: jacek
 Thyl: las niños
 Thyl: s is present
 Thyl: I have Spanish to my school
 TheBlueBias: i eñor
 jacek: uhm
 jacek: carfield, explain the joke to him
 Scarfield: spain - s
 Thyl: oooo
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 Thyl: ok I understand
 Thyl: I have 2 years of english
 Thyl: don't joke with the letters :D
 Thyl: and is los niños sorry
 eulerscheZahl: you only started to learn English 2 years ago?
 Thyl: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: then you are doing astonishingly well
 Scarfield: +1
 Thyl: Thx
 Scarfield: 2 year old english children cant even spell
 TheBlueBias: :no_mouth:
 Thyl: I ahve 13 years old, 
 Thyl: I have two years of ENglish
 Thyl:&#160;;)
 jacek: in basement?
 jacek: :scream:
 Thyl: no
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Hello
 TheBlueBias: All your basement are belong to us!
 Thyl: I'm 13 years old
 Thyl: I'm so tired And in Frecnh is ~ "I have 13 years old"
 Thyl: in the idea
 Thyl: eulerscheZahl now 27 is me 
 Thyl:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not 27, already reached the 30 :older_man:
 eulerscheZahl: from now on it's only going downhill
 Thyl: I have a hasher function
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Hello, Bonjour, Ciao
 jacek: :tada:
 Thyl: but I don't know if it's a good hash function
 Thyl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/lokOwg">https://codeshare.io/lokOwg</a>
 TheBlueBias: HARRYPOTTERFANATIC I think your time turner is broken.
 Thyl: eulerscheZahl Will you do the Fall CHallenge&#160;?
 TheBlueBias: ...
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: TheBlueBias Lol
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Maybe
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'll pass on the next contest
 eulerscheZahl: the first since The Accountant in 2016 that I'm missing
 jacek: oO
 TheBlueBias: You're not going to participate to spring challenge 2022?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the type of contest
 Thyl: A codechef contest&#160;??? :P
 eulerscheZahl: i have some contests lined up to play
 eulerscheZahl: Kotlin heroes on Oct 7th
 jacek: :ketchup:
 eulerscheZahl: then 2021 ICPC Communication Routing Challenge: Marathon (oct 9th-12th)
 eulerscheZahl: Reply Cybersecurity Challenge 2021 Oct 15th
 eulerscheZahl: on the 13th topcoder hosts a marathon for 7 days but collides with Reply&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: they finally messaged me to claim my tshirt from TCO 2021
 Thyl: Do you have a great ranking in contest for the same of TopCoder
 Thyl:&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not that good on topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: they have those short rounds (2-3h contests) where i'm horrible
 TheBlueBias: eulerscheZahl can you sahre the links for reply and topcoder?
 eulerscheZahl: and the marathons (7days+) were i'm somewhat ok
 eulerscheZahl: it's both on clist
 eulerscheZahl: marathon will show up here:

 eulerscheZahl: it's a team event. 24h for 25 tasks
 eulerscheZahl: team of 2-4
 TheBlueBias: Erf.
 eulerscheZahl: tasks are about coding, crypto, some web related stuff
 eulerscheZahl: 5 tasks per category
 jacek: i finally learned to use struct instead of class with all public things
 eulerscheZahl: last year I mostly managed to solve the coding part
 eulerscheZahl: Tobou will be happy to hear that
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: using struct...
 jacek: mhm
 darthinvader666: yo
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Hello
 SandmanSW96: hey all
 HARRYPOTTERFANATIC: Hi
 SandmanSW96: hey euler, is there a suggestion box page here?
 jacek: go to /dev/null
 SandmanSW96: the url?
 eulerscheZahl: forum I would saywhat do you want to suggest
 jacek: hmmm ok...
 jacek: or discord
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it has been suggested before and was refused or will be done eventually
 SandmanSW96: oh yeah the forum i can look, but i was thinking,
 SandmanSW96: what if commented characters weren't counted in clash of code golfing?
 SandmanSW96: I use c# and still try, i know i will lose lol but its good practice to learn short hand, so, since i am almost guaranteed to lose lol,
 eulerscheZahl: unlike to happen. one just does not write comments in golf
 SandmanSW96: i dont shorten my code into one line, i try to break it up into each section
 jacek: or use c# for golf...
 SandmanSW96: i can just eat the extra chars,
 eulerscheZahl: it's also not as trivial as you might think
 SandmanSW96: but i break up my code into segments,
 SandmanSW96: and i would like to label them for anyone to see what they do
 eulerscheZahl: x=2; // \u000A x=3;System.out.println(x);
 eulerscheZahl: what does this print?
 SandmanSW96: 2
 eulerscheZahl: in Java
 SandmanSW96: er 3
 eulerscheZahl: yes it's 3
 eulerscheZahl: that unicode \u000A is a newline
 eulerscheZahl: and the compiler replaces this first before applying the comment
 SandmanSW96: yeah i was trying to figure out that heiroglyphic
 SandmanSW96: but thanks though, i'll just eat the extra chars, my clash points are always close to max anyways lol
 eulerscheZahl: c# just isn't the right language for golf (will get better with C#9)
 jacek: 2 1 7 3...
 jacek: or 2137? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: 2.718
 Mehmetvv: hello?_
 jacek: hi!
 olaf_surgut: the next fall challange will be the coding escape room?
 olaf_surgut: what a surprise
 jacek: oO
 jacek: open the door, get on the floor, everypony walk the dinosaur ~
 TheBlueBias: Can I have some?
 CodeKing45: hey guys I got a question about the temperatures exercise?  the directions are vague or at least seem to be. am I supposed to answer only in console.log or do i have to set up an "if" iterator first?
 jacek: write answer into console.log
 TheBlueBias: You're supposed to output the good answer. You can do what you want with the default code. Even delete it and write yours.
 CodeKing45: ah thanks
 CodeKing45: one more question. by playing with the console only what is this supposed to teach me/
 TheBlueBias: Console only&#160;?
 jacek: you can interact with the puzzle only with i/o (take input, print output to console)
 jacek: some puzzle can have nice visuals
 jacek: coming from javascript world, using console only seems unnatural eh
 CodeKing45: can i play with n?
 jacek: n?
 jacek: oh, temperatures. this is number of temperatures provided by puzzle's test case. dunno what you mean by playing with it
 CodeKing45: oh i see now. its a function
 CodeKing45: nevermind

 GruelingPine185: hi
 miszu: hey all, I reached 57th in the 2048 optimization. I am hitting a bottleneck in my optimization as I don't know where should I improve. Anyone willing to discuss in DM?
 jacek: nice
 miszu: seed = seed * seed&#160;% 50515093L;
 jacek: is seed int64_t?
 miszu: it is a long
 miszu: in both places
 jacek: try long long
 miszu: jacek jestes geniuszem!
 miszu: it works
 TheBlueBias: 32bits PC&#160;?
 miszu: 64 bits
 jacek: personally i use int64_t uint64_t etc.
 miszu: but I guess there is a default thingy in visual studio
 jacek: long is at least 32bit, not always 64
 TheBlueBias: True. But in modern architecture it's generaly the case...
 TheBlueBias: MS... :smirk:
 miszu: I find it sad that my code online has a better score than offline if I let it run until reaching best state... I am using beam search in both cases
 struct: well sometimes a bad move may end up being good
 miszu: I am using 4100 as beam size so you can see 6 moves ahead
 struct: are you using nth_element?
 miszu: also not sure if my heuristic is ideal
 miszu: so I sort my open list based on heuristic then select 4100 best nodes
 struct: you use sort or nth_element?
 miszu: sort yes
 struct: nth_element will be faster in this case
 miszu: sort(open_list.begin(), open_list.end(), high_score_key()); // sort by best score.        
 miszu: I will check nth element
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5fa2cc35-ef36-4041-9ef7-54eea84cf511">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5fa2cc35-ef36-4041-9ef7-54eea84cf511</a>
 CodeKing45: what math is temperatures using? i change i in let =... and i get random integers but always the same. i log -10 and it comes out 6 instead of 5 for example
 struct: miszu also msvc sort might be different from gcc
 CodeKing45: console.log(n) 
 CodeKing45: let i = -10
 CodeKing45: what math is this thing using.
 jacek: the normal math :v
 CodeKing45: the only test that worked so far is zero
 miszu: ok I will try nth element
 miszu: also, when taking n elements, do you take by best score or by lowest # of turns?
 CodeKing45: i am just trying everything to see what works. so far the only one that works is 0 for let i = 0
 jacek: do you understand how loops work?
 CodeKing45: yes. what I don't understand is how it is being calculated or iterated
 CodeKing45: how THIS is being calculated
 darkhorse64: miszu, if you're doing bs, each node has the same # of turns
 CodeKing45: nevermind. I will solve this on my own
 Astrobytes: CodeKing45: post your code, easier to help you
 CodeKing45: this is the code that works

 miszu: darkhorse64 yeah using beam search
 miszu: so sorting by heuristic is fine when chosing n beams?
 Astrobytes: CodeKing45: it auto pastebins
 darkhorse64: yep, this is also what I do for 2048 but I hit a barrier
 darkhorse64: Can really explain why but I see long before the end that I am not going to score more than 25M. If you look at the lb, there is a huge gap
 jacek: OupsAn error occurred (#314): "Submitted code is too big".
 jacek: $#@$@#$@#$!!!!
 Astrobytes: Fix your compression
 Uljahn: import lzma [solved]
 miszu: anyone who implements beam search, do you use two arrays (one for open and other for the beam) or you are able to do all in one array?
 KINGOFBIGBOIMEME: SUS
 Jess316: @LemonZ can you explain this to me I am new here
 LemonZ: explain what?
 KingZumbie: hello
 KingZumbie: bruh I am doing the descent but keep crashing on stronger mountains 1
 KingZumbie: I think I found the solution
 KingZumbie: I have to hit 1 two times or three
 KingZumbie: Yup I cleared it
 KingZumbie: Used this code to do it
 KingZumbie: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/884720d1-4bd0-4d94-8cb0-db57cc21c03b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/884720d1-4bd0-4d94-8cb0-db57cc21c03b</a>
 KingZumbie: simple print function
 Wontonimo: hey
 KingZumbie: hi
 Wontonimo: you can't solve it that way because the validation test has the hills in a different location
 Wontonimo: you need to write code to *find* the highest value and print it
 KingZumbie: I just let the course run and whichever mountains the ship crashed on I putted in the print function for that number of index
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's not going to solve the problem
 KingZumbie: Well Id oit my way
 KingZumbie: I do it*
 KingZumbie: I ain't planning to work on some big project for the public coding is just a hooby for me
 KingZumbie: hobby*
 Wontonimo: how is your way going to pass ALL test cases?
 KingZumbie: Bruv I ain't planning on doing all of them
 Wontonimo: bruh
 KingZumbie: And I learned more HTMl and CSS rather then a other coding language
 KingZumbie: why do you think my way is not so good&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: look at this code
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a01c46f5-8e62-4465-9e0e-35d8b90a5233">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a01c46f5-8e62-4465-9e0e-35d8b90a5233</a>
 Wontonimo: it works for ALL the test cases
 Wontonimo: it doesn't have the answer hard coded.  it does what a program should do, which is calculate things for you and automate things.
 TheBlueBias: Yeah! GG Wontonimo! You shared the solution!
 Wontonimo: I think I won't get banned for this one
 Wontonimo: maybe scolded, but not banned. (hoping)
 eulerscheZahl: BAN!

 TheBlueBias: Yeah! Let's share solutions! We don't care to 
 Wontonimo: hey TheBlueBias, I haven't seen you before
 eulerscheZahl: it's BlaiseEbuth
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: so many alt accounts ... 
 TheBlueBias: Lier. :neutral_face:
 Wontonimo: mine is pretty obvious, antiwonto
 TheBlueBias: That's not an alt
 Wontonimo: it's a test account
 TheBlueBias: neither
 Wontonimo: don't do much with it other than look at the beginning of a multi that I no longer have access to
 Wontonimo: that's a pretty cool contribution Olivier made
 eulerscheZahl: idea for a part 2: don't give the user clear rules (red=bad), only tell after each event by changing a score. so the player has to understand the rules in code

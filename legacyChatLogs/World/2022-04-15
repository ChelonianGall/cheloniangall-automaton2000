 ASM_MOV_INT: clash time
 jacek: :unamused:
 SubZeRoy9: Wow that code looks complex
 SubZeRoy9: Welp. Logged on long enough for my daily reminder of  "You dont know jack squat." Im out see you guys tomorrow. 
 jacek: oO
 5DN1L: at least he didn't say jacek squat...?
 5DN1L: hmmm i don't even know what that means
 5DN1L: sounds like badword
 Westicles: jeez, some of these multis are like reading war and peace
 jacek: fog of war and fog of peace?
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 have you read any war and peace in this chat?
 Automaton2000: you could just use the same code
 Westicles: fireworks reads like the legalese on the back of a boat mortgage
 5DN1L: jacek is one of the approvers
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Westicles: pah, I'm ahead of him and I just submitted default code
 jacek: oh my
 thepianist59: hello everyone. The challenge will begin in just some days. Are you all ready&#160;?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i took off 6 days for the contest
 VizGhar: euler will finally win contest guys :D
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm still a noob&#160;:(
 VizGhar: We will have company hackathon during the contest
 eulerscheZahl: bad timing
 VizGhar: euler, you'll get better&#160;:)
 VizGhar: Yeah... I'd rather dump the hackathon then CG contest
 eulerscheZahl: you want to dump both sequentially?
 eulerscheZahl: "then" vs "than", couldn't resist. sorry
 jacek: do you get paid better for winning company hackaton?
 Westicles: both CotR puzzles have more than half in wood1, maybe I should do those instead
 jacek: what about :notebook: :soccer:
 jacek: huh Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: the boss is a real person
 Westicles: I'm just trying to promote all the woods, paper soccer doesn't have any promotes
 Westicles: so far Penguins is my favorite
 eulerscheZahl: hey Westicles, you brought in DLX for number shifting. I have a question about it:can i modify it in such a way, that it doesn't cover all items but as many as possible?
 Westicles: I never tried DLX, I think everyone was getting stuck at some lowish level with it
 Westicles: never tried to implement it anywhere else either...
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 200-ish for the better players
 eulerscheZahl: ok, thanks
 Gameonn: Hello friends, I'm trying to improve in algorithms. I take part in code clash
 eulerscheZahl: anything listed here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>

 Gameonn: Thanks Jacek
 jacek: beginner puzzles: the descent, power of thor, temperatur, horse-dual racing
 VizGhar: eulerscheZahl&#160;:| this is my classic mistake (then than)
 thepianist59: Just a question&#160;: I would like to change completely the algorithm I used for the pacman challenge (spring 2021) to be able to go gold league. I heard about MCTS and how it could be applied to games with hidden information but I have difficulties to understand mcts. DO you have good ressources to understand it&#160;? Thanks&#160;:)
 VizGhar: uff... I wouldn't use MCTS for that particular contest... best resource to understand how to implement it is probably this vid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a>
 VizGhar: In order to understand how it works, just open any article on medium about it
 Uljahn: this vid is great
 thepianist59: thanks for your help&#160;:). Just  for my curiosity. you said that you wouldn't use this type of algorithm for this contest. WHat do you have in mind for this&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't pacman in spring 2020?
 thepianist59: Maybe i'm wrong in the year, I admit ^^
 thepianist59: 2020, yes, I was wrong XD
 VizGhar: MCTS is good for games where you can really simulate whole game till the end, am I right guys? Chess, Checkers, UTTT, 9man-moris, GO etc. (you can consider "end" to be any state you can somehow precisely evaluate)
 VizGhar: But I have pretty narrow knowledge on this topic&#160;:)
 thepianist59: I admit that I am stille learning a lot about this , so I have to search and try to practice
 thepianist59: MY objective is to go gold league on my next challenge (in like 5,6 days)
 VizGhar: What you have used so far?
 thepianist59: min-max and some genetic algorithms. For the pacman, I just used a hungarian algorithm with a path calculation (I wasn't really sure how to tackle this one )
 VizGhar: I just printed semi random moves so far (didn't go too deep). But I'd probably go for beam search + some heuristic since it is multi agent (so my agents won't compete against themself)
 VizGhar: Or simply check post mortems :P
 VizGhar: wow... the discussion page is pretty empty there o.O
 Uljahn: guess you need the contest thread:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy</a>
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 VizGhar: Yeah so it looks like BFS is winner here :P I forgot about fog of war, beam might be unnecessary
 VizGhar: MCTS is unusable here i suppose
 eulerscheZahl: i'm an advocate of beam search for pacman
 eulerscheZahl: but i think i wrote that on the forum already
 jacek: if you want to learn mcts, learn first on some 'classical' games, turn-based no hidden information
 Audran227: @ThomasNicoullaud je m'excuse du message que magicienkennys a envoyé sur mon compte, nous sommes en classe et il s'amuse à écrire sur mon pc. Il m'a deja fait ban il y a de ca quelques mois. J'imagine que cela est compliqué mais pourriez vous annuler ce bannissement
 VilBoub_junior: ratio
 magicienkennys: hello guys i am very sorry for my bad language in the FR chat, I promise to not restart this bad behavior. Soryy @ThomasNicoullaud
 MarinDeNsi: :heavy_plus_sign::digit_one:

 Pessidu13: racism?
 VilBoub_junior: racism?
 VilBoub_junior: we won pixel wars
 VilBoub_junior: e*
 VizGhar: pexel?
 Westicles: france is not a race
 VizGhar: :grin:
 Pessidu13: discrimination?
 MarinDeNsi: vilboub_junior you mean r/place reddit&#160;?
 VilBoub_junior: yes
 Pessidu13: i dont like the hate y'all have against french ppl 
 Frankich: I don't like how you are representing the french as well...
 Frankich: french people*
 MarinDeNsi: peace and love Frankich ... 
 Nik05: francophile
 VilBoub_junior: long live France, the others are jealous
 Nik05: Why are you talking about France/French?
 jacek: :french_bread: :wine:
 Westicles: We learned about the french in school, they invented cheese and soccer, which they call handball
 MarinDeNsi: Dont forget the wonderfull bread that we call "baguette"&#160;:') ^^ uwu
 Nik05: handball is not football...
 Frankich: Because the students are bored I guess, and a chat distract them
 MarinDeNsi: haha you got me uwu ~~ ^^' xd
 VilBoub_junior: France proved its superiority during the r/place 
 Frankich: Come on ban them already
 Nik05: Who?
 Frankich: those kids..
 Valnor280: yeah as a french person even i can tell that their not the greatest representation of our culture sorry :expressionless:
 Magus: Try to keep the discussion about programming.
 LinhT.Nguyen: looking for jobbu :grimacing:
 jacek: Automaton2000 what is coding
 Automaton2000: what are you talking about the same time
 Ajaiy: That almost sounds sarcastic
 Ajaiy: Automaton2000 was that intended?
 Automaton2000: i mean it has to
 Ajaiy: oh ok then
 Ajaiy: btw the 2 in the power of thor 2 looks inverted
 jacek: hm?
 n0thing: :sob:
 derjack: :upside_down:
 RandomSteve: Are you sure it is not a 5?
 derjack: its 10
 RandomSteve: is that supposed to be a binary joke?
 Passifi: all jokes a binary you laugh or you don't 
 RandomSteve: why did I laugh to that
 RandomSteve: or should I say
 RandomSteve: 1?
 SubZeRoy9: Wow. That passed right over my head... 
 RandomSteve: fr?
 ThomasDrt13: oui
 SubZeRoy9: In bianary is 0s and 1s. If you invert the number two you get a weird 5 looking symbol... 5 + 5 equals 10. 1 and 0 are in binary? Is that the joke?
 RandomSteve: I mean IF it is a joke that would be the joke because 10 is equal to 2 so he would be saying to me "it's 2"
 RandomSteve: I just do not understand why he said 10
 SubZeRoy9: But theres no 2s in binary code. I would think a simple knock knock joke would be sufficient. 
 SubZeRoy9: But I am not that smart. This thing is called a computer right?
 RandomSteve: no there aren't any 2's in binary, but 10 in binary is equivalent to 2 in decimal
 RandomSteve: xd wdym this thing is called a computer
 RandomSteve: xd
 SubZeRoy9: a decimal looks like a period. I had to use periods in the only java statement im good at.... System.out.println(); It outputs things to the console. Console, maybe you could CONSOLE that guy for making such a crappy joke. Wow CSCI really makes me think hard....
 derjack: so random
 RandomSteve: I love bad jokes they are so good
 RandomSteve: dude derjack wdym "It's 10" what's 10?
 SubZeRoy9: Idk...
 derjack: becuase its not 5
 RandomSteve: ok but it wasn't a binary joke was it?
 derjack: no
 RandomSteve: ok thanks for taking the time to clarify
 RandomSteve: boy I've been working for days in the shadows of the Knight problem and I can never pass more than 3 levels
 RandomSteve: I've been learning so much tho
 RandomSteve: this current code looks ages better than the first code
 jacek: episode 1?
 RandomSteve: yeah
 RandomSteve: I managed to make this like amazing algorith that jumps half the distance between you and the edge of the cuilding
 RandomSteve: *building
 RandomSteve: in the direction of the heat signal
 RandomSteve: and then half of that in the next direction of the heat signal
 RandomSteve: and on test 4 I am missing exactly 1 turn to be able to win
 RandomSteve: amazing algorithm L
 RandomSteve: ok I gtg now
 RandomSteve: at least the algorithm did what I had in mind
 RandomSteve: I have new ideas to solve it but as for now I have to leave
 RandomSteve: goodbye everybody

 Sarstan: Any good place to learn multi-agent? Can't seem to find any place with actual code.
 jacek: like game of drones or platinum rift 2?
 Sarstan: Yeah.
 jacek: try their discussion forum
 Sarstan: I see in the drones one there's some pseudo code, but I'm not sure how to do the part about giving each of the drones commands.
 Sarstan: Honestly this has been driving me nuts for a while. No idea where to go to learn multi agent.
 Uljahn: learn single agents first
 Sarstan: You lost me there.

 Yvant2000sGames: Hey, maybe I'm dumb, but I was trying this challenge (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat</a>) and I can never pass the tests even if I clearly gave a solution to the puzzle. Am I missing something here&#160;?
 jacek: what do you mean. do you have any erro?
 jacek: r
 Yvant2000sGames: The game is saying "If your mouse reaches the border of the pool [...] you win the game.", but when I reach the end of the pool, the game still displays "LOSER!" after 350 turns
 jacek: what does the forum say? I havent done the puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a replay of such a loss?
 eulerscheZahl: share it with us, maybe the cat was faster is is waiting there for you
 eulerscheZahl: or you are close to the border, but at the wrong side of it
 jacek: or it is Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: it's friday. but a public holiday here
 jacek: holiday? huh?
 eulerscheZahl: decided to take a bicycle trip to the next city and have a pizza for lunch
 eulerscheZahl: restaurant was open according to their website. saw a note at the door: on holidays for the week
 eulerscheZahl: so i had to drive the 18km back. stopped at 2 other restaurants on the way, both closed
 eulerscheZahl: then tried another one in the opposite direction from my home. place is getting demolished already, owner had to move his restaurant somewhere else
 Yvant2000sGames: Wait there is a side to get out of the pool&#160;? I just tried and when I get out to the left, I loose, but when I get out to the right, it works
 eulerscheZahl: then tried 2 more that were closed until i finally found one
 eulerscheZahl: you have to avoid the cat
 Yvant2000sGames: Yeah I know that
 eulerscheZahl: can you just share a replay of your loss?
 eulerscheZahl: it's the 3 dots at the bottom right of the viewer, click it

 eulerscheZahl: in the puzzle itself
 Yvant2000sGames: bruh
 jacek: who approved it
 jacek: write it on forum
 Yvant2000sGames: I guess I'll report that

 eulerscheZahl: definitely not how i would have implemented it
 Yvant2000sGames: That's a weird bug, and I'm wondering how nobody found it earlier
 eulerscheZahl: you are going at a straight line, y=0the rest of us are doing circles before
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you should add an @igolus to your bug report so he will see it. but maybe he's already following the thread and gets an email anyways
 Yvant2000sGames: Yeah, I was about to code the circle strategy but I wanted to test how the game works before coding anything
 eulerscheZahl: set y=1 in your output and try again
 Yvant2000sGames: lmao it works
 eulerscheZahl: you probably triggered a division by zero or whatever
 jacek: math is so prohibitive

 eulerscheZahl: they actually do pay the money if you win
 therealbeef: how much did you win last MM?
 eulerscheZahl: and you can collect points for TCO. finals will be in the USA. they play the whole trip+hotel+food
 eulerscheZahl: i won $1 last time. and probably got into the finals, still waiting for the official update of the 3 months rating
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: are they streaming the finals?
 eulerscheZahl: i think so. but will be in November
 eulerscheZahl: $10000 for the winner. but really strong competitors, i'd be happy not to be in the bottom group
 Westicles: 5 bridges, that's a big change
 eulerscheZahl: game changer. and no guarantees that you can even connect all nodes
 eulerscheZahl: and Rafbill is hiding i think. was first with 98.5 score vs 60-ish for the next. then improved to 99.5 score. not at 0
 eulerscheZahl: there's surely a lot of points that i'm still missing
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: is topcoder very popular with hiring managers?
 eulerscheZahl: they have some paid gigs and contests with significantly higher prizes. but sure about permanent positions

 eulerscheZahl: in case of going to TCO finals
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm in fear of getting lost at the airport. once i was on a business trip with a colleague. he had to promise our secretary to look after me. "he's unable to survive alone"

 InCog: some puzzle called regular polygons
 InCog: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/regular-polygons">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/regular-polygons</a>

 zapakh: Sorry for swearing
 struct: np
 struct: what you said wasnt 1/100 as bad
 InCog: what did he even say lol
 zapakh: I feel better now tho :joy:

 GarageBap: how can I debug in GoLang? fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Debug messages...")this is giving me an error, because "os" is unknown. how do I initialize the outputstream? can anyone help?
 jacek: this line works for me
 jacek: do you have import "os"
 GarageBap: yes, there was no import. thank you!
 TheAlps: Hello everyone&#160;:)
 GarageBap: hi!
 TheAlps: How you doin&#160;?
 AY09: hello
 InCog: can someone help optimize my code for js cause I cant see to iterate over a loop of huge range with out timing out
 InCog: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/79138be1-1245-4458-99d4-5be43cbb086b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/79138be1-1245-4458-99d4-5be43cbb086b</a>
 InCog: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/regular-polygons">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/regular-polygons</a>
 InCog: the puzzle
 DaNinja: you missing a -1 on the length in your for loop?
 InCog: no as in it passes all the validators
 InCog: guessing cause x%NaN is just undefined which is not zero
 InCog: but for some reason its too unpotimized
 InCog: and I have pretty much removed all possible loops other than the ones needed
 Westicles: You are looping up to 2 billion
 InCog: ye but idk how I would go about the puzzle without checking each n side polygon if its possible
 InCog: my only other guess is you create an array with all the values then pop all multiples of invalid numbers
 InCog: but then I would still have to loop over the initial array to pop them out
 Westicles: There are only 31 fermat primes in this range, so you only need to loop over them
 InCog: oh wait there are 31?
 InCog: I mean currently I only have 5 so if theres 31 its just gonna be longer right?
 Westicles: Oh, there are only 5.  The 31 is this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A001317">https://oeis.org/A001317</a>
 InCog: yeah
 InCog: I am inclined to just estimate that anything after a billion isnt correct
 Westicles: I did this puzzle a while back so don't remember much, but looks like I have two loops of 31 each
 InCog: two seperate loops or nested
 Westicles: nested
 InCog: what language?
 Westicles: C++
 InCog: hmph
 DaNinja: two separate loops works in js
 InCog: yeah but not sure if its too unoptimized cause of the language or cause I suck
 Westicles: Well, looping to 2 billion is going to be quite a bit slower than looping to 31...
 InCog: true
 AntiSquid: have you tried precomputing the primes? 
 InCog: as in all the primes are in a list cause the primes needed are extremely small
 InCog: like only 5 values
 AntiSquid: oh 
 AntiSquid: ya well i bet you have bug somewhere
 InCog: Idts because I pass all the validators except for the last one
 InCog: and thats cause it times out
 InCog: not cause it fails 
 AntiSquid: didnt mean timeout bug
 InCog: oh
 AntiSquid: what about last test case then? or just validator?
 InCog: both
 Westicles: He is checking every number instead of just the powers of 2
 InCog: oh bruh thats actually so smart
 AntiSquid: so you have problems with big numbers
 InCog: yeah
 KiwiTae: o/
 AntiSquid: hi
 KiwiTae: hello squidi
 AntiSquid: lol
 InCog: Westicles I think that may actually solve the problem
 Westicles: ah, great
 AntiSquid: how are things inside best China? KiwiTae
 AntiSquid: and how is other china treating you&#160;?
 KiwiTae: Im in europe atm , Taiwan is not China ~~
 DaNinja: first loop to 31 counts the values within a,b. The second loop to 31 uses the fermat numbers to count the rest
 AntiSquid: oh whereabout in europe
 KiwiTae: just changed job 3months ago forgot to update my flag lol im in northwest of France on the seasside
 AntiSquid: well republic of china, but other china won't like calling best china, china
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt;
 DaNinja: * first loop to 31 counts the Math.pow(2,i) values within a,b
 Westicles: Lots of weird propaganda in the US news about asians.  I think not a good portent for Taiwan
 InCog: DaNinja yeah imma do that now
 AntiSquid: which kind of Westicles&#160;? only seen the news about some asian guy being shot by a non-white and then blm protest against white supremacy
 AntiSquid: congratz on your new job KiwiTae
 AntiSquid: and i was just making a joke based on the fact that China (the big country) doesn't like to acknowledge Taiwan as a country
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: There is a flood of stories about racism against China about covid.  The conspiracy theory is they are building a cancel culture on anything anti-China to suppress backlash if they take back Taiwan
 KiwiTae: AntiSquid thanks :D 
 AntiSquid: doesn't sound like a theory lol
 AntiSquid: not sure if you've seen the news UK plans to take in 300k Hong Kongers ...
 Westicles: I sure they will integrate just like the rest of your recent imports
 Westicles: aka not at all
 AntiSquid: depends on each individual
 Westicles: Not much of a religious component at least
 AntiSquid: the people that usually don't integrate are either illegals or do dodgy business here, aka albanian drug lords which couldn't even be kicked out since it would be illegal under EU law
 InCog: wait I am kind of stupid but is there a way to generate out all the multiples of a few values
 InCog: like given a set of number can you churn out all the possible combinations
 InCog: of products of numbers there can be
 InCog: cause I am doing it manually and I realized that I am kind of an idiot
 AntiSquid: precompute numbers of 2 to the power ... make an array
 AntiSquid: or whatever
 AntiSquid: what does your code look like anyway InCog&#160;?
 InCog: rn
 InCog: nothing
 jacek: 2 ** n? so 1 &lt;&lt; n&#160;?
 sonic1991: hi
 sonic1991: Did you make algo of the week&#160;? "Flower beds"
 InCog: can i ask in js is there a cleaner way to do this var array = [1,3,5,17,257,65537,3*5,3*17,3*257,3*65537,17*5,257*17,5*257,5*65537,65537*17,257*65537,3*5*17*257*65537,3*5*17,3*5*257,3*5*65537,3*17*257,3*17*65537,3*257*65537,5*257*17,5*257*65537,5*17*65537,17*257*65537,5*17*257*65537,3*17*257*65537,3*5*257*65537,3*5*17*65537,3*5*17*257]
 InCog: like
 InCog: to generate out all the combinations of multiples
 MAST3R: hi I'll become best programmer kurwy jebane\
 jacek: Oo
 MAST3R: siema
 Westicles: a(n+1) = a(n) XOR 2*a(n)
 geppoz: InCog there should be 2^5 combinations, you can use binary enum to generate
 InCog: aight thanks
 geppoz: for (let i=0;i&lt;32;i++){
 Tonnoaw: anyone code in C++?
 AntiSquid: lots of people do
 Tonnoaw: how will they win in shortest mode
 geppoz: any worth to be in this chat :D
 AntiSquid: Tonnoaw clash isn't the best part of this site
 AntiSquid: to put it nicely
 jacek: are there any other parts of this site?
 InCog: the multiplayers
 InCog: the puzzles
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: InCog, he was being sarcastic / joking
 InCog: I couldnt tell 
 jacek: :scream:
 AntiSquid: most people only know about clash, InCog
 InCog: thats quite sad
 AnushaDsouza: I AM LOVING THE PUZZLES
 geppoz: ty InCog , loved that puzzle&#160;;)
 InCog: what the regular polygon one
 InCog: a pain in the ass
 geppoz: nah, quite fun
 InCog: depends
 InCog: you didnt spend an hour trying to optimize looping over an array of billion integers
 InCog: only to realize a much quicker and easier solution
 geppoz: well, no need to looping more that 32 times...
 InCog: 32*32 to be exact
 InCog: but yeah
 InCog: oh well 
 geppoz: I just looped twice 32 times
 geppoz: once for a and once for b
 InCog: oh lol I nested the loops
 geppoz: no need
 InCog: yeah I should probs fix it if there is a faster method
 InCog: but nvm  maybe tmrw
 geppoz: anyway, general rule, when you see inputs range so huge neither waste a second trying a full loop on that&#160;;)
 InCog: yep
 InCog: learnt my lesson
 geppoz: and, second hint, when asked for search between two numbers A and B, often more easy to find answers like f(B)-f(A) and implement just an f()
 InCog: what do you mean by that
 InCog: like if x^2 then dont loop through all but loop through all the possible squares only?
 geppoz: in that case, I just did a function that find how many solution are below n: solutionsBelow(n)
 geppoz: then the answer is solutionsBelow(b)-solutionsBelow(a-1)
 geppoz: in the meaning that is more difficult to search between two numbers that below one number
 geppoz: so i search below one number (twice)
 InCog: oh aight
 FocusTurtle: hi
 geppoz: that happens in other problems too... maybe this morning i used that method again in a CoC
 InCog: oh so like a summation notation you would change the lower range to zero - the summation with an upper range a and lower base zero 
 Wontonimo: AnushaDsouza "I  AM LOVING THE PUZZLES" - spread the word!  
 jacek: dat grammar
 AntiSquid: looks fine @_@ Automaton2000 can you spot any errors?
 Automaton2000: it's not a problem for me in the right direction
 jacek: welp im not native english speaker
 jacek: but it seemed off for me
 InCog: spread the word does sound grammatically incorrect
 AntiSquid: think he meant the i am loving it
 AntiSquid: part
 Wontonimo: "spread the word" is an English phrase which means "tell others about it".  It's a common phrase
 jacek: "loving it"
 jacek: i thought expressing emotions dont have present continuous
 AntiSquid: it's an alternative way of saying "i am enjoying" it
 Wontonimo: no
 InCog: Seriously, never heard of it
 AntiSquid: common here
 AnushaDsouza: @Wontonimo&#160;: Deal!!
 Wontonimo: it has a religious connotation to tell others as if you are on a mission of god
 AntiSquid: jacek just treat it as an idiom i guess
 AnushaDsouza: "religious connotation" .. facePalms!
 AntiSquid: i hear it when people talk about how they feel about an experience
 AntiSquid: for example: "How are you finding your new job." =&gt; "I'm loving it."
 AntiSquid: might be a well paid job
 AntiSquid: my grammar isn't perfect sometimes, i fuck up a lot of sentences @_@
 InCog: can I just say
 AnushaDsouza: along the lines where the work at job dosnt feel like burden but make you look forward to it everyday... the puzzles here have me hooked, i just woke up today and wanted to solve more!... the best part is after i solve a puzzle i can compare my solution to others and improve my solution
 InCog: most of the maths puzzles here
 InCog: are easily cheatab;e
 InCog: cheatable
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop worshiping your job
 InCog: like they all have some formula which have already been figured out
 InCog: making them kinda pointless 
 AntiSquid: was an example BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 AnushaDsouza: depends on the person.... if we wanna improve or just wanna be in limelight
 AntiSquid: you could be on holiday in a country with no lockdown and someone asks how's your holiday and you can answer "I'm loving it!"
 InCog: No as in like if you do end up researching more about the formula sometimes you unknowingly get the answer
 InCog: doesnt mean you are actively cheating
 InCog: but its not through code
 AnushaDsouza: when it comes to coding, as long as one can understand the research and implement it, i think its great.... i have tried to train fresher's who would directly just copy paste a solution and then complain they have error.... thats what i call cheating
 AntiSquid: that's my annoyance with the math puzzles, the creators most likely found out about some formula on a numberphile video or elsewhere and then they decide to make a puzzle based on it while also trying to hide where they got the idea from, they should definitely state somewhere what math formula it's based on
 InCog: yeah
 PeakMaster: yo!
 InCog: then it comes down to writing out the formula in code
 InCog: and no longer about how you solved it yourself
 AntiSquid: and what am i supposed to do? reinvent the formula?
 InCog: I mean its an easy way of getting points for a puzzle though so I am not too annoyed
 AnushaDsouza: whats the fun in that? the fun part is figuring out the formula!
 geppoz: well
 geppoz: in this last puzzle
 AntiSquid: if you keep researching the solution you'll eventually stumble upon the formula
 InCog: nah nah as in like this puzzle called carmichael numbers
 AntiSquid: and this is a coding site, is this supposed to test your math skills&#160;?
 InCog: is like quite easy once you research it
 geppoz: i  just figured out the solution, it is not need to know the specific theory behind
 InCog: but its really hard if you dk how to do
 InCog: so then I am kinda inclined to just use the formula online and get the answers afterwards to see the proper way of doing it
 AnushaDsouza: i guess... 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/535577758">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/535577758</a> here last test case without know about the formula, i almost aproximated the solution through different means, but what's the point of me tweaking numbers until it works?
 AntiSquid: and here with the formula&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/488029795">https://www.codingame.com/replay/488029795</a>
 AntiSquid: knowing *
 InCog: lol
 InCog: thats actually pretty funny
 AntiSquid: as you can see i almost done it just with approximating values ... could train an NN i guess but it's all about knowing the formula since that's the most efficient way and therefore the right way to do it, that's why the bloody math formula should be mentioned in the god damn statement
 InCog: what level difficulty was it
 AntiSquid: i should go nervously downvote all puzzles in contrib section that don't mention the formula
 InCog: oh it was in the contrib section
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat</a>
 AnushaDsouza: nooo
 AntiSquid: it's medium
 InCog: oh what
 AnushaDsouza: that was fun, i want to try that game
 AnushaDsouza: *puzzle
 AntiSquid: formula is on numberphile, search for cat and mouse game
 InCog: aight
 InCog: I will probably try on my own first
 AntiSquid: i am 100% certain that's where he got it from
 AnushaDsouza: gonna go now, got an interview here in codingame later in afternoon... wish me luck guys!
 InCog: gluck
 AntiSquid: and you could probably find the magic numbers to do it, but it's really all about guesswork without formula
 AntiSquid: i am the 1 star voter on that puzzle btw
 AntiSquid: there's only 1 
 jacek: what puzzle? botters of the galaxy?
 AnushaDsouza: i wonder... if the interviewer will look for formula or will appreciate the efforts if i go about applying my own logic....
 SamSi: Hi where are the 5 min games here in codingame?
 SamSi: I am coming back after a long time and I couldn't find it here
 InCog: pretty certain if you know the formula then the interviewer sucks
 InCog: SamSi you referring to CoC?
 SamSi: The place where you need to solve some basic problem in 5 mins or something
 SamSi: Yes CoC
 AnushaDsouza: CoC
 InCog: uh check the pracitce
 jacek: under compete tab
 InCog: oh yeah
 InCog: compete I mean
 <b>**AntiSquid kicks jacek</b></p><p><img src="/a/59449248825030" /> jacek: generally people struggle finding anything else than CoC
 SamSi: Yep I was checking it under the practice tab :D
 AntiSquid: no the "escape the cat" puzzle
 SamSi: Shouldn't it be under the practice tab though
 InCog: no
 InCog: cause its a competition
 InCog: though only bots play it most of the time
 InCog: theres like 10 active players every hour
 AntiSquid: SamSi those are not games, go to compete and then bot programming 
 AnushaDsouza: i was pretty confident until now... now i am wondering if i should start my research by searching for formulas if im given a puzzle in interview...
 AntiSquid: hm i wouldn't bother, they should give the god damn formula
 AnushaDsouza: lol
 InCog: AnushDsouza I really doubt some guys gonna give you some complex theorem for you to figure out
 AntiSquid: AnushaDsouza you're more likely to struggle with regex questions imo
 AntiSquid: some interviews ask basic regex because they use them a lot
 AnushaDsouza: im a intermidiate level unity3D developer, so i think they will check my core logic grasp
 AntiSquid: i mean in general, not CG specific
 AnushaDsouza: or they might ask to design a bot
 AntiSquid: why not a multiplayer game?
 AntiSquid: if your interview is on CG you probably do something similar to puzzles
 AnushaDsouza: i have 0 exp with multiplayer game, its mentioned in my cv... im learning now though
 AntiSquid: doing a multiplayer for CG platform is different from a real multiplayer
 AntiSquid: they won't ask that i doubt it at least lol
 AnushaDsouza: i guess... thanks for the cheer up guys..
 cicero06: ım not doıng anythıng
 cicero06: ı guess ım a stupıd
 KiwiTae: AnushaDsouza just do your best if you failthis one u can try next one hehe
 Prostetnic_Jeltz: Here's a general thought about interviews: the job of the interviewer is to gauge your knowledge and ability. Ideally, they can sort of skip around and identify the edge of your ability. If they ask you only questions you know, then they have failed to sketch out the boundaries of your knowledge and ability.
 jacek: winter wrap up winter wrap up ~

 Kellthazar: Skynet Revolution Ep. 2 done! :D
 jacek: good for you
 AntiSquid: Kellthazar now beat jack here in multiplayer section for his snarky reply
 Kellthazar: Hahaha AntiSquid, I think that I need to improve more my skills to  be able to do well in multiplayer.
 AntiSquid: just practice
 AntiSquid: i mean play multiplayer
 AntiSquid: watch some CG intro videos on youtube, they have decent tutorials to start
 Kellthazar: Codingame is a bless... I was wasting my time playing "League of Legends", now I'm learning and have fun as well here.&#160;:) My objective now is finish all the classic puzzles.
 jacek: now youre wasting time on codingame&#160;:\
 wlesavo: beat jacek in coc ladderboard
 KiwiTae: Kellthazar i got an idea beat jacek in Botters of the galaxy (get a LoL feel playing that multi)
 jojoisyoyis: hello
 Wontonimo: o/
 Wontonimo: you go Kellthazar&#160;!  crush those puzzles
 Wontonimo: orangesnowfox are you using any memorization in 2048 or is it all computed?
 orangesnowfox: all computed I think?
 orangesnowfox: Not sure what memorized would be
 Wontonimo: like pre-computed offline
 orangesnowfox:  ah, no, it's all computed
 Wontonimo: nice
 orangesnowfox: Do a lot of people use memorized solutions?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: (i think)
 Wontonimo: for optimization puzzles at least
 orangesnowfox: hmm, I haven't run into any that allow memorized solutions I think
 Wontonimo: for 2048 you are given the seed.  you could compute the 1,000 moves offline for 1 board.  When given that board, first play the 1000 precomputed moves
 davilla: all the ones I've run into have random tests, so you can't memorize the entire solution... but given the seed it would always play out the same way
 Wontonimo: weird, then why are the test cases numbered in 2048
 davilla: memorization can be useful otherwise, you don't have to know the complete solution, for instance with opening chess moves, but then completing the game all computed
 davilla: dunno I haven't done that one yet, maybe they want you to do that
 Wontonimo: darkhorse64 , you worked on 2048, can you shed some light here?
 Wontonimo: are the tests and validators different?
 orangesnowfox: They aren't, except the "random" one
 orangesnowfox: which is... Random, every time
 Wontonimo: right, so you could hard just the start of one to get X number of moves pre-done.
 orangesnowfox: Right... Also, 1k moves is potatos
 Wontonimo: i see your 1k and raise you 2k
 davilla: that's not how calling works&#160;:-P
 orangesnowfox: ... My current code gets me to 16k in some seeds (possibly more or less in others)
 Wontonimo: i'm checking my 290797 score
 orangesnowfox: Although... I should take advantage of the fact that turn one gives me like... 20x more time
 Wontonimo:&#160;?!? you don't!?!
 jacek: 2048 here is deterministic, so you can make 'opening books' for it
 orangesnowfox: ... no?
 orangesnowfox: jacek, do you?
 jacek: no, i compute online
 orangesnowfox: same
 jacek: but if rust will beat me, then who knows
 orangesnowfox: Do you take advantage of turn 1?
 jacek: i compute more moves
 orangesnowfox: ah, so you do. I don't.
 jacek: noob
 orangesnowfox: lol
 orangesnowfox: And, because of random timeouts, I actually use `elapsed + average &lt; 36ms` for detecting if I should make another move
 jacek: i have 35ms some myself
 jacek: and can rarely timeout&#160;:&lt;
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, I bumped it to 36, becuause the number of resubmits I have to do there aren't that bad
 orangesnowfox: ... mind you, not that bad means between 1 and 3 submits total
 orangesnowfox: I could probably also be detecting time better than I do, who knows, maybe I spend a couple ms locking and unlocking stdin
 orangesnowfox: nah, only like 5 micros
 AY09: hello

 orangesnowfox: But yeah... I suppose if I actually used turn 1 properly, I'd have like... Hmm, I have about 58%-72% time efficiency (spending 29-36ms per turn)... that's worth like 30 turns wao
 orangesnowfox: I mean, it's not the biggest timesave I've had, but knowing I have a free 30 turns worth of slack I can pick up is good to know
 Wontonimo: jacek - that's not "people", it's MSmit s and kov i
 jacek: and the pikachu earlier
 Wontonimo: it's not been nice for me.... i got pushed down&#160;:(
 jacek: time to go back to uttt :imp:
 orangesnowfox: Hey, jacek, anything you do other than tune your beam search?
 Wontonimo: no ... i've got to resist.  I wanna get my global leaderboard score up, and a few more positions on uttt ain't really gonna move me much
 jacek: beam search? o.O
 jacek: i use minimax-like
 jacek: Wontonimo whatre you doing now
 Wontonimo: i do depth search using a heuristic with inefficient java code
 orangesnowfox: jacek, wait, you use minimax like? Do you use heuristics other than the direct score?
 jacek: yes, like snake-like tiles
 orangesnowfox: I... Have been using 0 domain specific knowledge
 Wontonimo: jacek I did a real hack attempt on SC2020 with no simulation.  so going back and actually writing a proper simulator+search
 jacek: i attempted to do td learning but probably was very buggy and didnt learn anything
 jacek: sc2020?
 orangesnowfox: Spring Challenge 2020 probably?
 Wontonimo: Spring Challenge 2020 - the pacman battle thing
 jacek: why do people use weird acronyms
 Wontonimo: i didn't before, but after a few months of seeing everyone else doing it i thought it was a requirement for being part of the cool crowd here
 Wontonimo: lol
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/535624091">https://www.codingame.com/replay/535624091</a> jacek, my bot literally just uses "throw more compute"
 jacek: you got the balls to share 2048 replay
 orangesnowfox: ... wat?
 Wontonimo: why not?
 jacek: how much does it weight
 jacek: for some people its too heavy
 jacek: :v
 orangesnowfox: oh, right, that
 orangesnowfox: it weighs over 15k moves :p
 jacek: and this is heuristic <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.softwire.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2048Example.jpg">https://www.softwire.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2048Example.jpg</a>
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... If my bot did that, it's emergent behavior
 Wontonimo: ^^ that's the heuristic i use
 orangesnowfox: tfw y'all use complex scoring heuristics
 jacek: i weight tiles with something like this
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a8825a5b-8354-4f4d-b954-0c70d2ee178c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a8825a5b-8354-4f4d-b954-0c70d2ee178c</a>
 Wontonimo: by p[x,y] &gt; p[x+1,y] then yes
 orangesnowfox: cg pastebin doesn't load for me
 jacek: then no heuristics for you
 jacek: it isnt in rust anyway
 orangesnowfox: lol, as if I haven't written a CSB bot in C++
 jacek: few ifs dont count
 orangesnowfox: legend :D
 jacek: few ifs dont count
 orangesnowfox: ... But my bot literally outranks yours, so I guess yours doesn't count either
 jacek: i wasnt serious in my csb
 orangesnowfox: ah
 orangesnowfox: What heavy compute bots do you have that you took seriously?
 Wontonimo: i see you are 226th in CSB
 jacek: mostly board games
 jacek: breakthrough, uttt, checkers, othello, chess, oware, onitama, ...
 orangesnowfox: ah, I couldn't figure a nice way to lay out data for uttt
 orangesnowfox: because 9
 jacek: rust doesnt support 9?
 orangesnowfox: lol, no, I was trying to bitset
 orangesnowfox: well, bit map
 orangesnowfox: bitvec? whatever
 orangesnowfox: Got demotivated because checking win conditions is pain
 jacek: hm? its just lookup 512 states
 Wontonimo: return if players bitmap in winconditionHash 
 Wontonimo: return if players bitmap in winconditionLookup (not hash)
 orangesnowfox: welp, I guess I should get around to setting up those 512 states
 darkhorse64: Wontonimo: I have a beam search with a snake like evaluation. I surely missed something because others are much higher with similar soutions
 orangesnowfox: darkhorse: maybe you're leaving perf on the table somewhere? Or others are using opening books
 orangesnowfox: err, darkhorse64: see above
 orangesnowfox: meant to ping
 jacek: tab plx
 Wontonimo: that's a great idea.  i've done something similar but realized I messed it up and now it isn't beam but just depth darkhorse64
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the trick that did it for me was to use the whole time you have including for the turns for one continuous beam search
 orangesnowfox: Also, is there a better way to do `can_move` / `apply_move` than the ref?
 orangesnowfox: Other than making can_move  short circuit because... well
 UnnamedCodinGamer: basically at the end of each turn you remember your best found move, apply the path to it and start from there the next turn
 orangesnowfox: mmm, the tricky thing there is that sometimes one of the other N-1 beams will be tied for score or have less score (but not to the point of elimination)
 orangesnowfox: and then those turn out to be better in like 5 more moves
 UnnamedCodinGamer: kr
 darkhorse64: It's not a performance issue rather something tied to the evaluation that makes me select the wrong beams
 orangesnowfox: I actually only take the first N moves of a beam
 orangesnowfox: Lets me restart whenever they converge
 darkhorse64: I also do that to prevent going into dead ends
 orangesnowfox: Yeah...
 orangesnowfox: Especially when your depth is decently high compared to the beam size
 leojean890: Astrobytes&#160;: now you kill me&#160;;)
 leojean890: 100%
 leojean890: not when I pushed
 leojean890: well.. I timeout, idk why^^
 jacek: o:
 jacek: astro after submit <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: darkhorse64
 UnnamedCodinGamer: {{1073741824,268435456,67108864,16777216},										{65536,262144,1048576,4194304},										{16384,4096,1024,256},										{1,4,16,64}};
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this is the evaluation that I use
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the other thing is to make your beam search carry on turn after turn, as I mentioned
 darkhorse64: ofc
 UnnamedCodinGamer: locally I get the same results in one continuous search 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I guess the top guys are doing the same but with even better evaluation
 jacek: or... they cheat :O
 UnnamedCodinGamer: how so?
 davilla: I tried cheating, it's really hard
 jacek: eric timeouting ~
 leojean890: I'm doing shit on clobber w1 hmm
 leojean890: mass losing
 jacek: youre timeouting also
 leojean890: yes ik^^
 leojean890: my cpp is not very fast
 jacek: no pragmas?
 jacek: increase your safe time buffer
 jacek: im usng only 90ms
 leojean890: weirdly not faster than my python I think xD
 leojean890: I use pragmas
 leojean890: and weirdly I never timeout against boss W2 and 100% winrate..
 jacek: then how can it be not faster than python
 leojean890: I'm missing something
 leojean890: I was careful about not copying data when I don't want (ref/pointers)
 leojean890: but still slow
 leojean890: :s
 jacek: using vectors and not using reserve?
 leojean890: maybe it's timeouts related to bugs in my code as well
 leojean890: yes without reserve:p
 leojean890: using reserve is better, ik (or arrays)
 davilla: python compiles pretty optimally
 leojean890: puqh &lt;ith python, but more loses
 leojean890: push with*
 leojean890: will re-take my cpp
 Midori404: Can someone please help me? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/the-descent-puzzle-discussion/1332/463?u=midori404">https://forum.codingame.com/t/the-descent-puzzle-discussion/1332/463?u=midori404</a>
 davilla: I'm kinda new here so I don't know how to look at your code, Midori
 jacek: Midori404 you could paste your code here :v
 Midori404: It's okay.&#160;:) I'm new as well.
 Midori404: Oh okay one sec. Though it's not technically my code. It's based on a video I was following along with since I couldn't figure out the Descent game. Anyways one sec thank you
 Midori404: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3f6387a-8c1f-47c6-87ea-b4c2694f1c0f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3f6387a-8c1f-47c6-87ea-b4c2694f1c0f</a>
 davilla: you're outputting a string
 davilla: it's not outputting the value of the variable, it's outputting the name
 davilla: because it's in quotes
 jacek: remove the ""
 Midori404: Oh. I guess yeah. I was just doing what the guy in this video said, but I may have looked at something wrong.... oh wait I'm dumb lol. The guy in the video wasn't using C++ so it's his error, not mine. I see now oops...
 Midori404: Thank you guys&#160;:)
 sonic1991: who is bot on chat&#160;?
 Midori404: ooops
 Midori404: aaaa
 Midori404: I meant my error
 Midori404: not his lol
 davilla: heh, no problem
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Midori404: Okay, I did it without it being a string and I still get this error: "Invalid command sent. It should be an integer from 0 to 7."
 davilla: do you know what it sent?
 davilla: you might have to debug
 Midori404: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61721da1-8928-4f61-9e5e-4ea0c5489ef5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61721da1-8928-4f61-9e5e-4ea0c5489ef5</a>
 davilla: wow, that looks like it hasn't been initialized
 davilla: just some random bits in memory that never got set
 Midori404: Oh. I sort of understand, but I'm confused on what I should do next.
 davilla: OK, well this problem is about looping, right?
 jacek: you make highestMountainIndex = i, the i from int i; in the beginning.
 MadKnight: Midori404 why is your if() not inside for()&#160;?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: orangesnowfox I just looked at my code - the best move is the one that has the common path of all moves in the beam at the end of the search for the turn
 davilla: I think the way the loop is supposed to work, it has to check on every i if it's the highest so far
 UnnamedCodinGamer: in this way there is no loss of information for the next turn
 davilla: yours is only checking at the very end, after the loop has completed
 jacek: Midori404, yeah move your if to for loop
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6231f928-346c-4103-954e-4b53d61d2836">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6231f928-346c-4103-954e-4b53d61d2836</a>
 Midori404: Oh okay jacek, I changed highestMountainIndex to i. And yes, davilla, I have to the loop games for the quest thingies. 
 Midori404: Okay knight I'll try that once sec
 Midori404: one*
 Midori404: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24ce657a-9047-47bb-8244-eb90b274eeea">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24ce657a-9047-47bb-8244-eb90b274eeea</a>
 davilla: which ones are undeclared?
 jacek: they are after while
 jacek: move the for before that }
 davilla: they're all undeclared in the second section, right?
 Midori404: @davilla all three mountain related variables&#160;:(
 SaidRasinlic: anyone got grid task solution java?
 SaidRasinlic: You are given an HxW grid consisting of the letters A-Z. The letters are weighted from A=1 to Z=26.Find the coordinates of the grid location closest to the center of mass of the grid (no solutions are exactly halfway between two grid positions).
 SaidRasinlic: in java
 davilla: that's because you added a loop at the top, and the variables declared there are only valid within that loop
 davilla: I don't think you need that first loop anyway
 Midori404: Oh
 Midori404: The first loop is that "while", right? Sorry if that's an obvious question. So I should delete the "while"? 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/fAtbFOM.png">https://i.imgur.com/fAtbFOM.png</a>
 davilla: yes, a while is a loop
 jacek: no, dont delete while
 davilla: sorry, jacek is right
 davilla: you do need that, but you need to do everything inside of it, my bad
 Midori404: I uh... I feel dumb. You want me to put the for loop just after the variable names? I'm slow sometimes I'm sorry lol
 Midori404: I just wanna make sure I understand the image you sent me
 davilla: like his image, yes. don't worry, just try it
 jacek: yes
 Midori404: only the line with the "for"? Okay I'll try one sec
 davilla: the whole for loop
 Midori404: Including the "if"?
 davilla: yes, that's all inside that one for loop
 Midori404: Alright one sec
 jacek: yes, but put the cout after the for loop
 davilla: oh good catch
 Midori404: Oh okay one sec
 davilla: basic outline is this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f56750c-3829-4382-abaa-b2a3bb99f4c3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f56750c-3829-4382-abaa-b2a3bb99f4c3</a>
 Midori404: It looks like the cout is after the for loop. This is what I have now: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e16194a5-07b7-428a-9c9f-e8cff4a95a97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e16194a5-07b7-428a-9c9f-e8cff4a95a97</a>
 Midori404: Oh okay one sec
 Midori404: Oh okay I see @davilla
 davilla: not sure about your indentation in the last one, does it work?
 jacek: Midori404 not yet, you still need another } above cout
 Midori404: I may have messed up my indentation while editing&#160;:( It doesn't work yet, no... It says my "program did not write to the standard output in due time."
 IxionTour: How to report someone?
 Midori404: Oh. Okay Jacek I'll try that
 davilla: every time you have an open curly bracket, the next line should be indented
 jacek: IxionTour in their profile
 IxionTour: thanks&#160;:)
 davilla: every time you have a closed one, you unindent
 davilla: that's not required, but it makes it a lot easier to follow
 davilla: so you can tell what's inside each loop or if
 davilla: and it makes sure the curly brackets are balanced
 Midori404: THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS! IT WORKS NOW&#160;:) I passed all the test cases. 
 davilla: woohoo!
 Midori404: Oh so after every closed curly, I indent?
 jacek: :tada:
 Midori404: I like to be neat, so I'll remember that
 Midori404: er... you said unident oops
 Midori404: unindent*
 UnnamedCodinGamer: is anyone using mcts for breakthrough?
 jacek: i think dbdr is
 davilla: maybe this would have made more sense: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f764415a-f67d-4f89-9497-1e18d87e659c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f764415a-f67d-4f89-9497-1e18d87e659c</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I wonder what roll out policy he is using
 UnnamedCodinGamer: random does not do well
 Midori404: Ah. Okay I'll look that over and I'll look over my code again to try to understand it more before doing a different game. I'll let you guys know again if I need any more help (which I will cuz I suck lol). Anyways seriously, thanks again guys&#160;:)
 davilla: now that you got it, look at jacek's first sample to see good indentation practice
 davilla: good work, don't be hard on yourself
 Midori404: Alright I'll check that out. And thank you.&#160;:)
 davilla: very welcome
 Perwex: Hello, I'm stuck on the puzzle of the week. My code passes all tests except the last one, where the answer is 1 number lower. Any hints/tips on how to fix this?
 jacek: add -1 in last testcase? :V
 IxionTour: ;D
 davilla: interesting, I had exactly the same result in one of my solutions
 davilla: but I was literally counting each spot, which isn't the way to approach that

 Astrobytes: ew
 leojean890: Astrobytes I beated you mostly a few hours ago when I reached W1 and then you submitted something else and you have since then 100% winrate against me^^
 Astrobytes: leojean890: Ah yes, I changed 1 or 2 things, I didn't even test against you, it was an experimental submit that worked quite well :D
 Astrobytes: leojean890: you're using MCTS or alphabeta now?
 YurkovAS: Astrobytes do you know about game specific bonuses/penalties for connect-4? do they exists?
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS: I'm not the best person to ask re Connect4 to be honest, MSmits or jacek should be able to help more. There's a useful website... let me see if I can find the link
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 leojean890: Astrobytes I see hehe^^alpha beta :P but my c++ is not very fast :P I have just added reserve to my vectors xD
 YurkovAS: Astrobytes thanks
 Astrobytes: leojean890: vectors for what? :P
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS: sorry I can't help further, I haven't worked on it properly yet
 leojean890: I use vectors &lt; vector&lt;char&gt;&gt; for the map xD
 leojean890: ik it's not the best way xD
 leojean890: maybe bitboard
 Astrobytes: bitboards!
 leojean890: chips hehe
 leojean890: (meabs we told the same thing in the same time;))
 leojean890: means*
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know :D
 Astrobytes: 8x8 = bitboarding
 leojean890: I used a bitboard for FC2020
 leojean890: just for castable and repeatable
 leojean890: my first bitboard ever xD
 leojean890: will be faster ik :p
 leojean890: you knew "chips" expression???
 Astrobytes: hm, that's just storing things bitwise, board games with bitboards are a little more 'involved'
 leojean890: yes^^
 leojean890: it's feasible 
 leojean890: maybe I'll do so
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I remember a couple of people I worked with used to say "chips" in that way
 Astrobytes: No idea where it comes from lol
 leojean890: i see^^it's young people kidding:p
 Astrobytes: verlan?
 leojean890: no^^
 leojean890: just joke:)
 Astrobytes: cool, I always get confused with verlan
 leojean890: expression
 leojean890: verlan is hard for not-native people^^
 leojean890: confusion
 Astrobytes: Some of it is obvious but not all
 leojean890: yes^^
 Astrobytes: DEpending on your exposure to French/French people and familiarity with how they speak :D
 leojean890: so - bitboard - terative deepening - MCTS =&gt;=&gt; do better here^^
 leojean890: yes:p
 leojean890: you lived there so you know a little:)
 Astrobytes: I have bitboard, iterative deepening, TT, little bit of strange ab window pruning
 AntiSquid: TT&#160;?
 Astrobytes: And I'm now at the point of giving up and going full MCTS instead.Ah transposition table
 Astrobytes: not the race AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: which race&#160;? @_@
 leojean890: so you prune using eval&#160;?^^
 Astrobytes: The Isle of Man TT Race!
 leojean890: such that keep the N best for max, and the N worst for min&#160;?;)
 leojean890: so that you go deeper&#160;?;)
 Astrobytes: Tourist Trophy, big bike race
 AntiSquid: oh i don't watch motor sports atm
 AntiSquid: ya just googled
 leojean890: or remove the ones you're sure they are too bad
 AntiSquid: at least someone is getting fresh air Q_Q Automaton2000 how you feeling&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i haven't touched it since
 Astrobytes: leojean890: well, standard alphabeta rules apply, but modifying alpha and beta appropriately as you go 
 Astrobytes: trying to reduce the search window to speed up/increase depth etc
 Astrobytes: TT helps with move ordering, good score with a cutoff improves depth, trying hashed move first also
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: The TT is always a great event, you should watch it sometimes
 Astrobytes: *sometime
 leojean890: idk TT^^
 Astrobytes: check chessprogramming
 Astrobytes: Just a fancy hashtable
 leojean890: transposition table you told that earlier sorry
 leojean890: zobrisk hashing
 Astrobytes: zobrist yes
 AntiSquid: stuck here overengineering vindinium lol, just gained 30 ranks and basically 60 CP Q_Q
 leojean890: to not visit again states similar or very close
 leojean890: to already seen
 leojean890: ab "window" idk that^^
 Astrobytes: Yes, you can use the stored score or the move if you choose to store the move too 
 AntiSquid: have some fancy approach i want to try out and meanwhile everyone else and their neighbour's dog is doing their bitboards and TTs
 Astrobytes: What fancy approach?
 AntiSquid: ah ... that's secret sauce
 Astrobytes: leojean890: alpha and beta - the range between the two
 Astrobytes: ML AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: nah
 Astrobytes: Well, whatever it is, good luck with it&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: some search algo, maybe someone else already tried it, but i want to think mine is special
 leojean890: vindinium =&gt; I'm #13 xD
 leojean890: with some BFS only 
 Astrobytes: I need to get back to that game, it's fun
 leojean890: my eval is not bad, I think
 leojean890: fun, didn't touch it for a long time
 leojean890: I was #30
 leojean890: and was just pushed #13 ..
 leojean890: If I submit I will be #30 .......
 Astrobytes: Let sleeping dogs lie&#160;:)
 leojean890: ML often wins I think
 leojean890: ^^
 leojean890: in CSB it's great^^
 leojean890: in oware, robostac uses it I heard&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It's definitely a strong approach for some games
 Astrobytes: Yes he does indeed
 Astrobytes: As does re curse, agad e
 leojean890: because offline calculation for a long time has to be strong if it's done well
 leojean890: recuyse and agade on CSB AND oware
 leojean890: ok^^knew only for csb
 leojean890: pb4 as well for csb
 Astrobytes: Also I think jacek uses some kind of learning for his jacekmax

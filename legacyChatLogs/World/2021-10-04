 TimothyAlexisVass: I've yet to come up with a fast enough solution.
 TimothyAlexisVass: The floating point precision makes it a bit complicated too.
 RoboStac: theres no need for any floating point maths to solve that
 derjack: all hail to doubles
 TimothyAlexisVass: RoboStac:How would you check 1/n==1/x+1/y?
 darkhorse64: you can rewrite the equation like this: xy=n(x+y)
 TimothyAlexisVass: :sweat_smile:
 TimothyAlexisVass: :facepalm:

 zakacat: I am such a noob
 zakacat: it is embarrassing 
 TimothyAlexisVass: How can I get multiple lines using open in Python?
 zakacat: Which is the easiest Loop problem to start with :S
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a> zakacat
 Wontonimo: wdym TimothyAlexisVass?  
 TimothyAlexisVass: I've seen it sometime, someone using the open function to get multiple lines of input.
 zakacat: oh buddy, thanks Scarfield
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 TimothyAlexisVass: But reading the documentation, I don't understand how.
 TimothyAlexisVass: I mean why*
 eulerscheZahl: is this golf related again?
 Wontonimo: you can get the whole document like this
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yes, it's supposed to be used for documents, so I don't understand how/why it works for STDIN.I saw someone using it in a clash.
 eulerscheZahl: because the stdin input also exists in a file
 eulerscheZahl: switch to bash, write "ls" and play your code
 eulerscheZahl: (preferably not on an interactive puzzle)
 TimothyAlexisVass: That's sneaky
 TimothyAlexisVass: haha
 RoboStac: open takes string filenames or integer file descriptors and stdin is file descriptor 0 so open(0) will give you the contents of stdin 
 LagunaElectric: Is there a way to make codingame print to a local file?
 zakacat: Scarfield, I finally got that one, Thank you, that boosted my confidence a bit.
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: now into :notebook: :soccer:

 4ThaWin: Is the discord more active than this chatroom?
 brennon: hcjehucuekjwhuijkdxjafhnd itghwbxhdw
 darkhorse64: Not really. Discord is a much better of the chatroom but it is not integrated in the ide, so it is  not really catching up
 darkhorse64: *better version*
 darkhorse64: discord is great for fixing typos like this one
 jacek: but can be easily defeated by the elements of harmony
 eulerscheZahl: and discord has different types of spam. users (probably bots) that spam the same link on all channels
 eulerscheZahl: phishing
 Firestormninja: imagine if the discord was integrated in the IDE
 Firestormninja: so nice

 Uljahn: else: rotate = 0
 Thorcode: I got that
 Thorcode: but my rocket doesn't go in my direction
 Thorcode: it fly away from the land
 derjack: second if is tabbed
 Thorcode: or lx is not the x of the land
 Uljahn: it's the first if unindented, happens with c&amp;p all the time
 Thorcode: s = int(input()) for i in range(s):
 Thorcode: I think my problem come from this
 Uljahn: ye, use debug to make sure the direction is correct
 Thorcode: I didn't get the right land right?
 Thorcode: how to get the right land in this?
 Uljahn: are you solving marslander ep.2?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: Oh the land y==land y from the start and end 
 Uljahn: land_y==land_y_previous
 Thorcode: thanks
 Thorcode: find the right land is not as easy as I thought
 Thorcode: wow TechnoBot solved mars lander ep 3
 Uljahn: x
 Thorcode: how can
 Uljahn: solving with c&amp;p teaches you almost nothing, you miss a ton of experience and fun
 Thorcode: yep I'm trying to do this alone
 VizGhar: c&amp;p?
 Uljahn: copy&amp;paste
 Thorcode: I think that is puzzle
 TheBlueBias: Cola &amp; peanuts
 VizGhar: ah :D i don't do this :D
 VizGhar: code and play
 Thorcode: gosh find the right land and the right x and y it not easy
 TheBlueBias: There's only one flat land
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: find the land y and y is easy but get the right land x is not
 Uljahn: how so?
 TheBlueBias: huh?
 VizGhar: you get this on input, why its hard?
 VizGhar: what language u using?
 Thorcode: I put an x array and got two right land y
 Thorcode: python
 Thorcode: not it got alot land not the right land I want
 Uljahn: what land do you want?
 TheBlueBias: If you find the two equal y, you got their repective x, so what's the problem?
 Thorcode: the land with the same lnad x and y
 Thorcode: I only put the y in my list
 Thorcode: and the x I forget it
 LelouchVC2: They key is to crash land
 Uljahn: just store x and x_prev
 Thorcode: yeah i'm so stupid
 Thorcode: thanks guy
 Uljahn: you should focus more on solving than chatting then
 VizGhar: :point_up:
 Thorcode: I always got problem with the input
 Uljahn:&#160;?
 Uljahn: do you know how to print to debug?
 Thorcode: no?
 Uljahn: :scream_cat:
 TheBlueBias: -_-
 Uljahn: did you read comments in default code?
 Thorcode: not really I ussally delete them all
 ProCoder03: better read them&#160;!!
 Uljahn: nobody reads comments, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: did you even look at the difference between the two
 Thorcode: yes after 5 months on CG this is the first time I know in the comment has debug :D
 Thorcode: and something useful
 ProCoder03: even though Automaton2000 is a bot, Its pretty funny for a bot!!!
 Automaton2000: and you have to pass all the test cases
 Thorcode: is he a real bot? ProCoder03
 ProCoder03: yes&#160;!!!
 TheBlueBias: Automaton2000: Thorcode thought you were a fake bot...
 Automaton2000: i use the first turn
 Thorcode: I'm confusing bc the bot has the i'm a creator achievement
 TheBlueBias: Automaton2000 create happiness
 Automaton2000: what do u think that?
 Thorcode: my mind boom with that bot
 Cosmo: Evening folks
 ProCoder03: So can we do Fall challenge as an individual&#160;??
 Thorcode: yep
 TheBlueBias: No
 Thorcode: Thibaud said that in discord 
 Thorcode: [CG]Thibaud — Hôm qua lúc 20:18Exceptionally, it will be possible to play the Coding Escape mission of the Fall Challenge 2021 as a solo player 
 Thorcode: is this true?
 ProCoder03: well I was thinking about it&#160;??
 ProCoder03: was it sarcasm or real&#160;??
 TheBlueBias: Oh. Well, yes so...
 ProCoder03: No more searching for teammates :grinning: :joy: :wink:
 Thorcode: I've just check that
 Thorcode: is that all of member in top 3 team has prize?
 Thorcode: if yes I will play team else I will try to duel :D
 ProCoder03: yes
 Thorcode: ok I will play with my team :D
 [CG]Thibaud: Thorcode why ping me to confirm I wrote in the announcement channel? Please don't
 Thorcode: oh sorry
 [CG]Thibaud: confirm what I*
 Thorcode: I just copy your message and forget that&#160;:(
 Thorcode: I should read the rule of the contest more carefully :sweat_smile:
 Raghuveer: i need help in spring challange
 Raghuveer: wood 2

 Raghuveer: lol
 Raghuveer: please help me
 ProCoder03: what's your preoblem&#160;??
 ProCoder03: *problem
 Raghuveer: i dont understand
 Raghuveer: it
 ProCoder03: if you can't understand the puzzle, I am afraid I can't help much 
 Raghuveer: i understand it
 Raghuveer: a bit
 Raghuveer: why did i stop in the middle
 Thorcode: show us your replay
 ProCoder03: That's something you only know....

 TheBlueBias: The pac is where you said it to go...
 ProCoder03: yeah...
 Raghuveer: ok
 ProCoder03: the way you filter the pellets in your code is the problem it seems
 Raghuveer: lets gooooo
 Raghuveer: ready for areana
 Raghuveer: arena
 TheBlueBias: He doesn't filter anything, just print the same coordinate all along...

 aangairbender: hey guys, is it possible to use simd in rust on codingame?
 TechnoBot: hmmm?
 derjack: release mode?
 TechnoBot: Why is CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2021 at 3:00 am?!?!?!
 aangairbender: TechnoBot it lasts for multiple days
 TechnoBot: ok
 TechnoBot: so ill be ok
 TechnoBot: thx
 derjack: but noone gonna participate anyway
 TechnoBot: there are participants
 TechnoBot: CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2021
 aangairbender: true xD
 aangairbender: nah bot programming forever
 TechnoBot: Im not a bot
 TechnoBot: im Technoblade
 TechnoBot: brb
 TechnoBot: its only cause this is "approprite" for coding
 TechnoBot: pls join my team
 TechnoBot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/events/t4z-VTs-KDG-mhg?join=thP-WDR-AHi-amk">https://escape.codingame.com/events/t4z-VTs-KDG-mhg?join=thP-WDR-AHi-amk</a>
 MSmits: I wonder how they will make sure it is fair. I mean you can start at any moment, but if team 1 takes a look at the challenge and tells team 2 what to do 2 days later, then team 2 has a speed advantage
 MSmits: it must have a lot of random elements i guess?
 Uljahn: the first to solve will win
 MSmits: mmh so you do need to start at 3 am to win?
 Uljahn: ye
 MSmits: that's weird. They did not mention that in the details
 MSmits: they made it sound like timezones would not be an advantage or disadvantage
 Karne: "How is the ranking working?
 MSmits: ok so both ways of sorting has issues
 MSmits: from the official start time you have a time zone advantage and when you consider time to solve you have an information advantage
 MSmits: seems there is some unfairness either way. 
 MSmits: unless you consider the event to be more about fun/participation, then thats fine i guess
 Uljahn: then there is no reason in having prizes though
 MSmits: depends, if they are just low cost prizes, it's fine
 MSmits: (like t-shirts)
 Uljahn: you mean t-shirts for everyone?
 MSmits: top 20, it's a small prize so the unfairness doesn't bother me then
 MSmits: it already doesn't count for contest leaderboard
 Uljahn: don't underestimate t-shirt hoarders, they'll be competing death serious :smiley:
 MSmits: haha that's fine
 Cosmo: I don't know that I could bring myself to enter a competition for the prize alone tbh
 Cosmo: Like, in general
 Milanovich: Can you add using statements for c# like Globalization to deal with decimals( . and , )
 MSmits: Cosmo me neither, but prizes do affect the motivation of players.
 Cosmo: also I've not been in a hot minute but you seem familiar, ulhjan, have you always been a mod? 
 Cosmo: MSmits, I guess, though of the competitions I did enter, I think there was only one prize of interest, a  cute little robot thing?
 MSmits: ahh ok. The ones I participated seriously in only had t-shirts and artwork
 Cosmo: probably years ago now, was having a rough time with my health/sleep for years after my undergrad thesis throwing my pattern out
 Cosmo: a couple of years*
 MSmits: contests do not help with sleep
 MSmits: unless you think not sleeping is of benefit to you
 Cosmo: Indeed, though I've been relatively good at learning to limit work hours over the course of the pandemic
 MSmits: you mean by working at home?
 Cosmo: well, last 6 months, but a lot of health improvements in general in the past 3-4 years
 Cosmo: By working from home, by lowering stress.. I lost all routine for a while at first but as of a few months ago I'm now someone that wakes at 7am sharp every morning which I had never done since birth
 Uljahn: no, not always
 Cosmo: Less energy spent pretending to keep up with external expectations of how morning routines work, more energy available to figure out what I actually need to be healthy/functional
 Cosmo: noted, uljahn, how long have you been particpating in CG in general, may I ask?
 Uljahn: 6+ years
 Uljahn: yep, 7 already
 Cosmo: oh, neat, you definitely would have been a least active way back when I was then
 Cosmo: sidenote what's the deal with the language level assessments now?
 Cosmo: I did job search test but it seemed to just be 4 minor progressions of a single exercise?
 jacek: hm?
 BADASZ: please can someone explain the MIME type solution to me 
 BADASZ: its really confusing 
 BADASZ: im a beginner im just trying to get better at codding 
 Uljahn: check the puzzle tags for hints or go to "discussions" tab for more hints
 Uljahn: i guess if you lack the basics as a beginner you'd be experiencing hard times here
 Cosmo: also googling "MIME types" may or may not help to provide conceptual context.
 aangairbender: hey guys, is it possible to use SIMD in rust on codingame?
 GoldStandard: I came here thinking I could go from nothing to ~not nothing~  am I wrong? Everything feels too advanced...
 darkhorse64: I think it's now possible with Rust in general, please check supported version and crates at CG
 Press_F_to-Cesar: who wached jojo?
 5DN1L: GoldStandard, you need at least some basic knowledge of any one programming language to start solving the puzzles here
 5DN1L: Otherwise, you may have to explore the learning section first: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>

 Astrobytes: Any more spam and I kick you
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 eulerscheZahl: am I late to the party?
 Astrobytes: seems so :D
 Astrobytes: struct is in hunter-killer stealth mode 
 eulerscheZahl: shadows of the knight
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Drayble: hi
 eulerscheZahl: 6 days left to validate the rubik cube. i might give it a shot on the weekend
 Astrobytes: oh the j rke optim?
 eulerscheZahl: and coder one is close to launching their new version of the game. might be my replacement for RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: yes, the jrke one
 eulerscheZahl: he made the cubes unsolvable, I checked that already
 eulerscheZahl: corner stones with same color on both sides
 Astrobytes: Nice! Didn't realise it was ready for approval.what's the coderone game? The bomberman thingy?
 TheBlueBias: Where is it? I want contests!
 eulerscheZahl: yes. now with 3 bombers per team
 Scarfield: sounds caotic
 Astrobytes: interesting
 Scarfield: insert h
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland">https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland</a>
 eulerscheZahl: caothic?
 eulerscheZahl: catholic?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: chaotic and catholic are anagrams :tada:
 Astrobytes: nope
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you are no fun
 Astrobytes: back to remedial English for you
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Catholic bomberman would be an IRA game, not sure that would be acceptable...
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of the holy bomb from worms world party
 Mau2e: .
 Scarfield: HALLELUJA
 eulerscheZahl: haleluja :boom:
 Astrobytes: haha yes indeed!
 rizonbro: hi
 rizonbro: you guys good
 Scarfield: the donkey was nice as well
 Scarfield: hi
 rizonbro: where
 Astrobytes: Worms was great
 eulerscheZahl: i always played with unlimited ninja rope. and then used the baseball bat in close combat
 Astrobytes: Ah, the true professional
 Scarfield: oh yea you could swing around, but prod/push kills where the most satisfying
 Astrobytes: for sure :D
 gtrkogvrko: Has someone done Equivalent Resistance, Circuit Building&#160;? I don't know how to resolve it
 eulerscheZahl: seems that I solved it
 eulerscheZahl: keep replacing the inner-most group by a single resistance
 gtrkogvrko: ok thanks i ll try!
 MSmits: hey guys, I optimized my meta mcts program for draws and went from 2 million nodes to 175k nodes on solving 7x5 C4. Still have to optimize the bot it's calling to play the games. That may give me another factor of 10 I think
 Daredevil1902: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db124ee0-35c6-4543-8f4c-6015856b00f6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db124ee0-35c6-4543-8f4c-6015856b00f6</a>
 jacek: the bot calling to play the games?
 jacek: also, do you somehow remember the moves from inside the plays?
 MSmits: i dont remember the moves from inside the plays. The bot being called to play the games is basically my c++ bot thats on the leaderboard
 MSmits: so a C# windows forms gui program calls this bot and also manages the db
 MSmits: i still need to optimize that c++ bot, working on it now.
 jacek: just something i remember reading nested MCTS paper, that remembering sequencing moves from rollouts improved the bot
 MSmits: how would that work?
 MSmits: oh you mean played moves inside the rollout. there's only a few of those
 jacek: probably something like rave
 MSmits: yeah i guess some of that could be used.
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/nested.pdf">https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/nested.pdf</a>
 MSmits: thanks, I'll take a look
 Drayble: DONT CLICK IT
 Drayble: IT BROKE MY PC
 Astrobytes: Drayble: Quit being an idiot please.
 Drayble: ooo how'd you get your text red
 Drayble: also my b
 Astrobytes: Just type in a username and it will appear red for that user only
 jacek: Drayble only mods can write in red
 Astrobytes: back in your box jacek
 MSmits: jacek-in-the-box&#160;?
 Atomcast: you guys suck dick
 jacek: and dots
 Astrobytes: Bye-bye Atomcast
 _Anthony_: ok
 WhoTho: he said hes very sorry for his actions and hes hope to improve on his behavior and has learned his lesson
 Astrobytes: Tough luck he's banned.
 WhoTho: :O
 eulerscheZahl: where do all these trolls come from all of the sudden?
 WhoTho: idk
 Astrobytes: classrooms I think
 WhoTho: actually ye we in chem rn
 struct: sorry ill unban him
 Astrobytes: Pay attention in chemistry. Especially organic chemistry. It's fun.
 Drayble: yo chem is harder than i thought
 WhoTho: the work the teacher assigned doesnt work
 eulerscheZahl: did all the teachers decide to send their students to CG?
 jacek: what you can do after organic chemistry :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Make things
 Drayble: blow things up
 struct: is this the teacher job?
 Drayble: through the scientific process
 eulerscheZahl: there were classes coming in the past. but not that extreme
 Astrobytes: oh some are worse
 Drayble: in a controlled environment, of course
 eulerscheZahl: maybe CGs growth strategy is working
 struct: this is why im a mod
 struct: to improve growth
 Astrobytes: are they giving away sweets?
 struct: by banning
 Scarfield: its just pruning
 Astrobytes: heh
 eulerscheZahl: more bans =&gt; more 2nd accounts to keep trolling
 jacek: hydra eh
 Drayble: idk why ppl just make 2nd accts
 Drayble: or troll in the first place
 Drayble: such a waste of time
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 Scarfield: i think it was Ille who had someone keep making accounts with a counter in the end of his nickname
 MSmits: Ille instructed someone to do that?
 jacek: it was Automaton2000 's 1999 ancestors
 Scarfield: xD, no i meant someone kept trolling him, the counter got rather high iirc
 Automaton2000: i have no clue what my bot was trying to use the boost
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: who won the staring contest?
 MSmits: I haven't seen ille in a while
 eulerscheZahl: making new accounts is so noob level
 eulerscheZahl: write a script that changes your nickname every few seconds to dodge bans
 jacek: deleting ones is pro
 eulerscheZahl: when the mod writes "/ban nickname", you are already somewhere else
 julio11111111111111: w
 jacek: he has high count
 darkhorse64: this guy has been banned quit a lot of times
 darkhorse64: quite
 Scarfield: yea, the counter is in binary
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I would say make a script to change your name to add a random number so it can't be guessed what the next one is and then only change the name whenever you place a message in chat
 MSmits: then they go by the name in chat and it's always different right
 MSmits: more efficient too. No need to overload the servers just to troll
 eulerscheZahl: you will still see the current name on mouse-over
 eulerscheZahl: the chat name won't even update, caching...
 MSmits: oh hmm, did not think of that
 struct: just ban by id&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: we can do that?
 struct: no
 Uljahn: just ban by subnet
 eulerscheZahl: but i did other overheads in the past. like downloading all puzzle contributions including comments
 eulerscheZahl: or playing top100 of each game vs self
 MSmits: ah but that's for a good cause
 eulerscheZahl: good thing that the game quota is per arena and not a global one
 eulerscheZahl: when you are blocked from 1 game, you can continue with the next
 struct: hmm, is it still like that?
 eulerscheZahl: at least it was about 3 weeks ago
 struct: ah so you are probably right
 struct: I thought it was global for some reason
 eulerscheZahl: side effect: the games on your start page are always different
 DouglasBolden: haha
 Wontonimo: more bans =&gt; more 2nd accounts =&gt; CG's num of reported users goes up =&gt; keep up the banning!
 jacek: more suicides -&gt; less suicides
 MSmits: more is less?
 xspeedasx: accurate but unacceptable
 DouglasBolden: Spicy Comment
 Someone.kt: Why the feck is Kotlin language assist never actually loads?
 MSmits: real Kotlin heroes don't need assist
 xspeedasx: they use iphone autocorrect
 darkhorse64: they ask siri to write the code
 jacek: they write in java and convert to kotlin
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ayeurgood: hii everyone im new!
 ayeurgood: nice to meet u guys :D
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: nice to meet u too! I joined yesterday lol
 ayeurgood: lets goo
 ayeurgood: what program language are your primary ones?
 struct: foxpro
 jacek: java/kotlin for working, c++ for bot programming and python for... hmm
 ayeurgood: i havent heard of that one woow
 ayeurgood: i started with py and now learning js :D
 ayeurgood: even though my collegue probably gonna teach us C# and java
 ayeurgood: college*
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: onstely, the only language I know well is HTML/CSS, I am trying to learn java on freeCodeCamp but it is extremly difficult for me
 ayeurgood: python kinda the ones im most familiar in i guess, ive been sticking to js more often though :o
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: (im 12)
 ayeurgood: ohh i see, i started java also but its kinda difficult haha
 jacek: how js is so popular :thinking:
 ayeurgood: idk, i would guess that its used around the globe for websites stuff, also the core for web apps
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: I am interested in machine learning I wish I knew how to use it but I can't even get past the first game on the AI path
 ayeurgood: i think you will come to it eventually :D
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: Thanks!:grinning:
 ayeurgood: i just did like 2 clashes and im disappointed
 ayeurgood: these questions kinda new and p difficult for me 
 jacek: clashes vary. better stick to the puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: p difficult?
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: Im in class rn gtg bye!
 ayeurgood: pretty difficult 
 ayeurgood: goodluck!
 eulerscheZahl: so NP difficult?
 jacek: yes, if P=NP
 ayeurgood: yeah i guess, i cant solve them though 
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: ok out of class anyone got suggestions on what language to learn after HTML&amp;CSS mastery?
 DouglasBolden: Go
 DouglasBolden: or SQL
 DouglasBolden: to use with your HTML
 DouglasBolden: Python if you want to use all three together
 DouglasBolden: and then Javascript to tie them all in.
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: thanks!
 DouglasBolden: You are welcome.
 TheBlueBias: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: i don't agree gjjkdfcjnsjfn.  if you are learning and already know html, javascript would be fun for you
 Wontonimo: check out "the coding train" on youtube, he has tons of really really awesome content for beginners
 jacek: (...) javascript would be fun (...) :scream:
 <b>**eulerscheZahl played a whole bot contest with JS</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: which botcontest?
 eulerscheZahl: yare
 MSmits: pirates?
 eulerscheZahl: yare
 MSmits: YARRR!
 eulerscheZahl: yare.io
 MSmits: o
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps MSmits around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: jacek, I really think javascript is fun for people who already know HTML.  Javascript allows them to add motion and actions to their html
 TheBlueBias: And to add trackware, and stuffs :3
 eulerscheZahl: or you use a big framework like blazor to get around JS
 MSmits: make a button that moves away when people try to click it
 jacek: like X in ad?
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: this sort of thing helps keyboard manufacturers
 Wontonimo: really, why are you all hating on JS so much?  Do you really think Go + SQL like DouglasBolden suggested would be better for someone who only knows HTML+CSS&#160;?
 struct: js is allright
 jacek: this is my usual js trolling
 TimothyAlexisVass: I used to think JS was crap, then I learned it and now I think it's good.
 Wontonimo: tbh, I had the same experience.  I *HATED* it for 15 years.
 Astrobytes: I've hated it for ~21 years and don't plan on stopping any time soon :P
 Wontonimo: lol
 bearnilu: lol
 jacek: oO
 DanteFromTheHitSeriesDevilMayCry: Haha Waahoo! Pizza!
 Astrobytes: DanteFromTheHitSeriesDevilMayCry: Haha Wahoo! Keep talking crap  and get a free kick!
 DanteFromTheHitSeriesDevilMayCry: mega bummer dude
 Amrhossam: I want to get a job as an iOS developer any thoughts&#160;? I made several clone apps but what’s next
 Wontonimo: apply for a job
 AndoMcTavish: +1
 Wontonimo: the 5 things that will help you get a job:
 Wontonimo: job experience
 Wontonimo: education
 Wontonimo: ability to pass the interview
 Wontonimo: actual technical ability (the lowest out of the 5)
 Westicles: You'll never be a mod like that.  You are supposed to tell him to click on 'GET A JOB'
 Wontonimo:&#160;:( oh, my hopes and dreams are dashed 
 Wontonimo: get to know the right people by getting out IRL to tech meetups, keep a good relationship with teachers and profs, etc
 jacek: meeting other people :scream:
 Wontonimo: seriously, does anyone do that anymore?
 eulerscheZahl: play contests, get the contact info of recruiters for free
 eulerscheZahl: or just create a linkedIn profile i've been told
 Westicles: I wonder why they decided to let individuals do the escape contest
 eulerscheZahl: over 1000 teams of up to 6 players competed
 Westicles: Ah, numbers again
 Foxwizard5556: error code
 Foxwizard5556: haha bertio
 Illedan: Hello
 Wontonimo: in uni when there was an option to go solo on group assignments, i'd always pick solo
 Wontonimo: hmm... I've been doing that at work also now that I think about it
 Wontonimo: :wave: Illedan
 Illedan: I get more energy from working in a team. 
 darkhorse64: If team has any energy
 Illedan: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i think a team would be of advantage in the escape thing. different people have different ideas
 eulerscheZahl: but there's also the saying "the only winning move is not to play"
 Wontonimo: who says that?
 jacek: the cold war people?
 Wontonimo: oh, from War Games
 Wontonimo: i really liked that movie
 Wontonimo: totally forgot about it.  what a pleasant memory.  Thanks eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't seen the movie. I only know the quote
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: :D
 Wontonimo: i just watched a clip.  the memory was better
 struct: ive been doing ecapes rooms for weeks now to practice for the contest
 Scarfield: they really shouldnt take weeks to escape from
 jacek: welp&#160;:( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46765692">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46765692</a>
 zeplul: never going to another escape room :smiley:
 Astrobytes: jacek: damn dude that's awful
 Astrobytes: jacek: also from 2019
 Astrobytes: We need a Global Thermonuclear War game
 Astrobytes: We've got TTT variants and chess
 Astrobytes: Now we just need GTW, ofc authored by Dr. Falken

 MSmits: don't spoil the best opening moves for c4 please
 struct: finally
 struct: just what I needed to improve my bot
 AllYourTrees: smits what'd you update in your latest C4 bot?!
 jacek: its emergent intelligence
 struct: I think he improved his bot AllYourTrees
 AllYourTrees: :expressionless:
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: I think it was mostly his solver
 jacek: TT
 TheBlueBias: (╯°□°)╯︵&#160;:)
 struct: ah and that
 jacek: he flipped the table?
 AllYourTrees: _jacek when you train your value nn how many simulations per turn do you use during training?
 jacek: mostly 200
 struct: only 200?
 jacek: yes, for most games
 AllYourTrees: thats good to know cool
 jacek: simulations, as in 200 iterations, as in 200 x selection, expansion, 'rollout', backpropagation
 Jario_Productions: Hello
 AllYourTrees: :thumbs_up:
 struct: hi
 TheFighter: yooo
 TheFighter: tbh I think I'm the best coder here
 AllYourTrees: me too, i've heard about you
 TheFighter: yea, I always love meeting fans
 DanielAlejandroLoaizaMazuera: shutup bruh
 DanielAlejandroLoaizaMazuera: no one cares
 DanielAlejandroLoaizaMazuera: ole goofy boy
 DanielAlejandroLoaizaMazuera: ole dick in the booty ass boy
 TheFighter: Bro who do you think you are
 TheFighter: Bro I bet you are so dumb
 TheFighter: Don't even know how to code
 TheFighter: Why you stop talking
 struct: he is banned
 TheFighter: oh damn
 AllYourTrees: people on the internet are so weird
 TheFighter: honestly
 ipsissimus: lol that went 0-100 real quick
 TheFighter: honestly. that dude thinks he is so cool, trying to beat a professional
 ipsissimus: we all make mistakes in the heat of passion, jimbo
 CristianHG: TheFighter you sound like someone who doesn't wash between their buttcheeks because they think it's gay
 AllYourTrees: :thinking:
 TheFighter: At least I'm not gay
 CristianHG: "HoNeStLy. ThAt dUdE ThInKs hE Is sO CoOl, TrYiNg tO BeAt a pRoFeSsIoNaL"
 TheFighter: Now you think you're cool
 ipsissimus: some people just cant handle the neutron style 
 CristianHG: Well I'm gay and that statement is offensive
 juandiegox17: I'm gay too
 juandiegox17: Can you not be offensive, thank you
 TheFighter: hahaha GAY
 juandiegox17: ._.
 juandiegox17: Please stop.
 CristianHG: Please stop being a homophone
 AllYourTrees: so how about that local sports team
 Westicles: all these french smurfs pretending to be dumb americans
 AllYourTrees: that game the other day phew
 CristianHG: baguette
 juandiegox17: I thought this place was cool with LBTG
 juandiegox17: people
 ipsissimus: as a dumb american im not impressed :nail_care:
 juandiegox17: Didn't know this community was so unwelcoming.
 CristianHG: As a dUmB AmErIcAn iM NoT ImPrEsSeD :nAiL_CaRe:
 CristianHG: 🍆
 CristianHG: wowwww
 Astrobytes: struct that was the wrong guy (first one)
 ipsissimus: chat going mega hamm today
 Astrobytes: oh wait no
 Astrobytes: or maybe
 TheBlueBias: Yeah Westicles, there's enough dumb americans without adding fakes...
 struct: maybe
 TheFighter: Just like the gender you're supposed to, it's not that hard
 struct: I guess he can email cg
 struct: idc too much tbh
 Astrobytes: This crap annoys me so much.
 Astrobytes: It also puts people off from participating in the chat.
 Scarfield: yea, today has been bad, but ty guys
 TheBlueBias: Chat is peaceful when there's nobody on. Coincidence? I don't think so! Ban everybody Astrobytes!
 Astrobytes: TheBlueBias: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: not even a keyword list for auto-moderation eh?
 Astrobytes: Primitive webchat man
 Scarfield: hey be nice to wonto
 Scarfield: :p
 struct: ban Wontonimo
 struct: ah missed a /
 struct: you are lucky
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: ffs, OK OK lol
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: it's a primitive webchat, man
 Scarfield: I enjoyed that more than i should
 Astrobytes: Friday mood eh :D
 Scarfield: ye&#160;:) but why did i start with locam again
 Astrobytes: lol, only you can answer that
 jacek: lolcam?
 Ethan....: i wrote the worst code possible, it was just .replace&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: if it was just replace and it passed the validation, then I'd say it's pretty good
 Wontonimo: lol Astrobytes
 5922: Why does it seem as though some of the answers that I'm presented to rate don't show up in the published list?
 struct: o.o
 5922: I saw a really strange one and wanted to find it, but I can't seem to.
 Wontonimo: have you solved that language for that puzzle?
 5922: I am pretty sure it was a Java solution, but it did look rather strange, which is what made me look for it. Perhaps it was another language, though. 
 5922: Are the solutions presented not always in a language for which you have provided a solution?
 jacek: you can see answers for the language you solved it
 5922: Yea, I solved it in Java and was presented three solutions to rate before viewing the published solutions.
 5922: I don't see one of the ones that I rated in list of published solutions.
 Scarfield: that must be some new feature, havent seen that before
 jacek: i saw that rating feature, but i dont know when do they come from
 struct: rate my c4 please
 jacek: :bomb:
 jacek: darn, im gonna browse through the c4 memes once again
 Fabricioo:&#160;???
 Scarfield: ill rate your c4 10/336
 MSmits: struct, I got my solve for 7x5 C4 down from 2 million nodes to 93k 
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: over 20x faster
 MSmits: because of the optimization for draws
 struct: how much time does it take now?
 MSmits: i didnt time it, i just look at nodecount
 MSmits: but it's fast, around 15-30 mins
 MSmits: was a full morning before
 MSmits: but that's 7x5 ofc, not particularly big. I solved 4x11 earlier, that took longer
 struct: ofc but the improvement should also help ther other ones
 MSmits: yeah, especially the ones that are solved as draw
 MSmits: 9x7 is not solved as draw, but with the steal move it is
 MSmits: (I am guessing)
 jacek: its not solve until you solve it
 MSmits: i am trying the smaller sizes first though.
 jacek: whats the biggest you solved
 MSmits: currently the normal c4, so 7x6. 
 jacek: and is 9x7 within reasonable scope?
 MSmits: 4x11 has more cells though
 MSmits: but is easier to solve
 jacek: but only 4 moves
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: 9x7 seems within reason, if within reason is months. That is my guess
 struct: months?
 struct: damn
 jacek: amazon aws it is then
 struct: yeah just rent 128 threads server
 jacek: and mine c4 coins
 Westicles: ^^ the french have reported you can get at unpublished solutions through that ranking thing
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/NtfIwvT">https://imgur.com/a/NtfIwvT</a>
 MSmits: trying to replicate: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 MSmits: so far it matches
 struct: are you using 128bit?
 MSmits: 2x 64 bit
 struct: ah you are using msvc
 struct: I forgot
 MSmits: doesn't matter though, i don't think the 128 bit is faster. It's the same as using a struct prolly
 struct: yeah
 struct: do you use avx?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I know i should probably compile it with a different compiler for 10-20% speed up
 MSmits: but I am not installing linux or some such
 jacek: intel?
 struct: well you really just needed to enable wsl 2 :p
 MSmits: wsl 2?
 struct: windows subsystem for linux
 MSmits: meh
 struct: basicly you have linux on your windows
 MSmits: whenever i touch things like that it goes wrong
 struct: yeah I guess its always a risk
 MSmits: gonna try for 7x7 now
 MSmits: maybe finish it overnight if possible
 struct: i give it 45 minutes
 MSmits: no way, it's much much longer
 MSmits: 7x5 was up to 30 mins
 MSmits: John says it's a draw as well
 struct: 7*5 = 35 - 5 = 307*7 = 49 - 5 = 44
 struct: my math checks out
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: if only that were true, then i could d 9x7 in an hour :P
 MSmits: btw, i tested it for a normal bot too. It solves faster if you improve the solver function. It didn't help to touch the selection function
 MSmits: I tried not selecting children that already have a drawn child
 MSmits: it worked for the meta mcts, 20% improvement, but in a normal bot the slowdown hurt too much i guess
 struct: why?
 struct: cant a node with a draw child still be a win?
 MSmits: yes, i mean i still select it, but as a lower priority. So only if all children have one
 struct: ah ok
 jacek: draw child means opponent has at least draw
 jacek: so no win
 MSmits: no but the opponent can win
 MSmits: i skip it because the player can only draw and lose with that node
 struct: jacek but one of the other childs that is not solved can be a win for you
 jacek: then opponent would choose the draw
 MSmits: you guys are confusing the child layer with the grandchild layer
 MSmits: which is why you disagree
 jacek: if youre talking about nodes, children of parent node are opponent's moves
 struct: yeah but if only one of those children is solved as a draw
 struct: maybe the opponent has one that is still a win?
 jacek: then its lose for me eh
 struct: oh
 struct: I see
 struct: im wrong sorry
 MSmits: i usually see child nodes as player moves and grandchildren as opponent moves
 MSmits: the current parent node is always an opponent move for me
 MSmits: root node = opponent move
 MSmits: maybe a matter of definition
 struct: yeah i was confusing it a bit
 struct: this new solve thing confuses me a bit
 MSmits: it is pretty complicated. I can't explain it well with a drawing
 MSmits: without
 struct: yeah I get how it works
 jacek: try with pseudocode
 struct: readable pseudocode
 jacek: woah imagine paying for that
 Scarfield: if (!win){loss}
 MSmits: just simplified the code a bit (hopefully not introducing bugs)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24289be2-c11b-49e0-bae5-10a61c03e6af">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24289be2-c11b-49e0-bae5-10a61c03e6af</a>
 MSmits: that has the optimization
 MSmits: i keep "hasDraw" on the node
 MSmits: to keep track a node has a child that is a draw
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: what knowledge will i need to know about coding (python related) i know indexes,input,strings,lists and and variables
 MSmits: conditions and loops
 MSmits: functions are helpful
 MSmits: at some point, also classes
 MSmits: you can avoid classes in many puzzles though
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: i think i know classes
 MSmits: did you use def&#160;?
 MSmits: and "for i in range(x):"
 MSmits: and "if, elif, else"
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: what is def
 MSmits: a function
 MSmits: it's easy enough to learn
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: oh ok
 MSmits: do you know the other 2 i mentioned?
 MSmits: the for and the if/.\
 MSmits: you absolutely need those
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: am learning if
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: statements
 MSmits: ah ok, loops soon too
 Uljahn: also dictionaries, sets, list comprehension, maybe generator expressions
 Wontonimo: passionisNOTmymiddlename , if you are still on , here is a nice python practice resource <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 struct: nice Wontonimo
 TechnoBot: hi
 bsemagn: lol
 TechnoBot: brb
 Wontonimo: i'm back
 struct: wb
 Wontonimo: wb?  i know not this code you use
 struct: welcome back
 Wontonimo: ah.  it's an old code, but it is still valid i see
 Wontonimo: let me guess, nothing happened since i left
 struct: dont think so
 struct: at least that I noticed
 Westicles: Alec Baldwin killed somebody...
 struct: I saw that
 struct: with a prop gun right?
 Westicles: I guess.  So *something* happened
 _Cerulean_: cojones
 aaron9753: where should a new coder start? im kind of lost..
 Wontonimo: hey, what programming language are you going to start on?
 Wontonimo: aaron9753, have you done the onboarding challenge yet? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding</a>
 aaron9753: c# was what im going for, looking to get into game design 
 Wontonimo: that's cool (there's no money in it, but it's cool)
 aaron9753: i have not tried that one 
 Wontonimo: I love making games.  just never made made even 1$ at it
 aaron9753: yea its hard unless with a corp. kinda sucks right now lmao
 Wontonimo: try the onboarding challenge I sent you.  choose C# as the lang
 aaron9753: Thank you!!
 Wontonimo: tell me how easy/hard that was once you are done
 aaron9753: super easy, it had me copy it in lol
 Wontonimo: okay, cool.  glad to hear
 Wontonimo: next up is  .... i can't remember ... the one where you help Captin Kirk ... anyone&#160;?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>

 Wontonimo: give this a try
 aaron9753: ahh okay, Thank you:D
 Wontonimo: how's it going aaron9753 on 'the descent"?
 aaron9753: still a working, im still, uhhhhhh, novice at best lmao
 Wontonimo: no problem
 Wontonimo: if this one is giving you trouble, then this site is probably too hard right now.  I'll DM you with more info
 aaron9753: i was stuck on this one yesterday. I think this is probably too advanced
 ipsissimus: can anyone link me the archive of the puzzles?
 Smelty: hi
 ipsissimus: i just ran out of time on a CoC and i really wanna finish it
 Thorcode: nice
 Smelty: can someone join team :c

 Thorcode: sorry I have my own team
 Thorcode: and you can solo
 Thorcode: Smelty do you want to join my team
 ipsissimus: hey python question.
 ipsissimus: if i have for element in number:
 ipsissimus: what does the * actually do
 ipsissimus: i cant seem to pin down the behavior
 Thorcode: is h is list?
 ipsissimus: yes
 ipsissimus: i know it unpacks it somehow but what are the rules of unpacking
 ipsissimus: because it doesnt seem to work in every context
 Thorcode: what does it print?
 ipsissimus: it prints each element space separated
 ipsissimus: in this case
 Thorcode: I think that take the element in h list
 ipsissimus: ive also seen it used for unpacking iterator objects like generators
 ipsissimus: but like i said im not sure how it works exactly
 Thorcode: ipsissimus thanks for that new "*" i learn something about it on the internet
 ipsissimus: i still dont know how to use it correctly for anything that isnt a list
 ipsissimus: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: afaik it is just for lists
 ipsissimus: well ive seen some witchcraft in these solutions that are definitely not list usages
 KayKay1202: Hey anyone still here
 KayKay1202: Lol
 Wontonimo: nope.  definitely not
 KayKay1202: Hah 
 ipsissimus: gone fishing

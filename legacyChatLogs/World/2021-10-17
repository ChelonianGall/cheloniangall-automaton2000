 MSmits: i remember that
 eulerscheZahl: not even an efficient code. adding 1 char in a while loop
 eulerscheZahl: that's what you did recently and realized it's slow MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: btw struct how did codeforces go?
 eulerscheZahl: and what's your nick again?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Hello
 MSmits: ah yeah thats really slow.
 MSmits: i actually knew this a long time ago. You just forget as you gradually move from smaller strings to larger strings in a project you're doing
 MSmits: if they are large from the start, you dont make this mistake
 KalamariKing: is it normal that when the game view is completely collapsed, the output pane stops?
 KalamariKing: never had this happen before
 jacek: hmm? isnt contatenation by char in c++ efficient?
 MSmits: not sure what it's like in c++, but in any case, at best it's like a vector that is consistently at capacity and needs to scale up every time something is added
 MSmits: this is why you give a vector a high enough capacity before you start adding
 MSmits: not surehow a vector&lt;char&gt; compares to a string in c++
 TheBlueBias: Both use contiguous memory so perfs are probably close.
 TheBlueBias: o/ btw
 jacek: i meant in c++ there is nothing wrong using += for concatenation, while in java you use StringBuilder for that
 TheBlueBias: Hmm... Well you can use +=, push_back or append to do that. And none have standard complexity guarantee... 
 TheBlueBias: So using += isn't worse than the other ways, but is it efficient? :thinking:
 MSmits: in C# you also use stringbuilder. I think the problem with string is that it always makes a completely copy when using +=
 MSmits: doesn;t it make a copy in c++ as well&#160;?
 jacek: the += apparently not <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/611263/efficient-string-concatenation-in-c">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/611263/efficient-string-concatenation-in-c</a>
 MSmits: if i do string a = "hello" and string b = "world" then string ab = a + b will create a completely new string
 MSmits: so the + operator makes a new string. Is += really different?
 jacek: a += "x" is different than a = a + "x"
 KalamariKing: yeah, shouldnt x+=y be parsed as x=x+y from a compiler standpoint
 MSmits: that surprises me
 KalamariKing: like shorthand
 KalamariKing: interesting
 TheBlueBias: Depends of the implementation.
 TheBlueBias: But no, it's not just a shortcut. It's considered as a different operator.
 jacek: for primitives its probably  the same, but objects can overload that
 TheBlueBias: Right.
 TheBlueBias: For an object when you do a += b, that mean a.operator+=(b)
 TheBlueBias: So you directly act on the a instance
 PouyaSabeti: hi
 MSmits: good to know about the operators. I always assumed it was a shorthand
 jacek: oO
 GaMiRab: Oo
 struct: eulerscheZahl i didnt do that round
 struct: im trying to improve my bt bot for some reason...
 eulerscheZahl: oO
 jacek: another approach?
 struct: a few improvements
 struct: I addeda an heuristic to find always a win from 6th row
 struct: so it solves 3-7 plys earlier
 struct: I might try  minimax
 struct: my movegen now is 20% faster
 jacek: :tada:
 TheBlueBias: Time to delete account!
 jacek: you have mcts now?
 struct: yes my bot is mcts
 jacek: how expensive is that heuristic? you could try it in playouts and/or tree policy first
 struct: its fast yes
 struct: on tree it will surely have almost no penalty
 struct: on the rollout im not sure
 struct: on the rollout i probably can check if there is a piece on 6th/7th row before calling it
 struct: it doesnt use pdep/pext or any of that stuff
 struct: just or, and, shift
 struct: I can explain how it works if you want
 MSmits: is this c4 struct? 
 struct: no, breakthrough
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: i have something like that as well
 MSmits: congrats for making it work as an improvement, it wasnt for me
 struct: why isnt it a improvement for you?
 MSmits: no idea, maybe the rest of the bot is just too weak to notice the difference
 struct: ah I see
 struct: mine only solves from 6th row and after
 struct: does your solve sooner?
 MSmits: 5th yes, but does not make use of allied pawns
 MSmits: so it looks at its own pawn and all opponent pawns
 MSmits: if there is a way to race to the end, it solves
 struct: ah I see
 struct: my heuristic doesnt apply the moves
 MSmits: mine doesnt either
 struct: Neither knows the actual solution
 MSmits: it's a lookup
 MSmits: array lookup
 struct: o.o
 Wontonimo: i'm trying GITC.  Fun playing a multi that is heuristic heavy and search light
 MSmits: struct, in the first second i play out every possible situation from a specific square on the 5th row with every possible opponent configuration in the triangle in frot of that
 MSmits: i front
 MSmits: i store that in an array
 MSmits: and I pext the bitboard to do the lookup
 Wontonimo: still working on breakthrough eh?
 struct: ah I see
 MSmits: struct is
 MSmits: i use minimax to do the playouts
 MSmits: for the lookuparray
 struct: maybe the lookup will be faster than what I currently have
 MSmits: could be, no idea, if I did not fail so hard at BT i could tell you if it is good o rnot&#160;:)
 struct: so you still solve it?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i guess you can play games vs me and see how well i solve, but my search is poorer than yours, so that makes the solver weaker also
 struct: I think mine was solving sooner I think
 struct: without this heuristic
 jacek: well i also have extended solver, as in bunch of ifs from 6th row, and it noticeably improved my mcts bot, at least if used in tree policy
 struct: for example my heuristic doesnt really use minimax or any of that
 jacek: with bitboards its easy. if there are  not defended attacks from 6th row (and opponent hasnt his pawns on ours) then there is win
 jacek: but maybe you need to pay for some papers to understand that
 MSmits: :rage:
 struct: so mine does this
 struct: i check all attacked cells
 struct: on 7th and 8th row
 struct: attacked/where I can move
 struct: if I have more of the same cell there I can move that enemy can defend its a win
 struct: if I have 3 pawns that can move to b7, its a win
 struct: because oponent can never defend against 3 pawns
 MSmits: yeah that sort of thing should work
 struct: it does yes
 struct: same thing for less pawns
 struct: if I can move 2 of my pawns to same cell opponent need 2 pawns to be attacking that cell
 struct: it works on all scenarios
 MSmits: yeah seems cheap too. I guess this is what jacek does, or similar
 MSmits: i might have overthought this one
 jacek: it was really cheap, costed me 0$
 jacek: im trying to learn new net with more weights, this time supervised
 MSmits: doesn't get any cheaper than that
 eulerscheZahl: who pays your electricity bill?
 MSmits: the sun
 eulerscheZahl: the daily mirror
 MSmits: no I mean the glowy thing you see sometimes when you go outside 
 jacek: but i need to generate much more positions i think. with 50m positions, they are even time-wise. with fixed iterations, the bigger net wins about 60% games
 eulerscheZahl: what is that outside? tell me more
 MSmits: you can google it I think
 MSmits: it's like a high res sim
 MSmits: jacek do you keep duplicates in your positions?
 TheBlueBias: Tested it once. The graphics are beautiful, but the scenario and the gameplay are real shit...
 MSmits: like the early positions are worth more because they are duplicated?
 MSmits: TheBlueBias mostly I think it has too much grind
 jacek: i have unique positions stored
 jacek: but i double the positions due to symmetry
 MSmits: I wonder if there is some value in making early positions more important in the training process
 jacek: TheBlueBias you maxed out the wonrg stats
 jacek: what do you mean more important
 MSmits: like, their loss has a multiplier thats higher
 jacek: but beginning positions are less accurate
 MSmits: hmm say hypothetically you know their exact value
 struct: you should also train 2 nets on uttt
 struct: they seem like 2 diferent games
 MSmits: and you're doing supervised
 struct: should train*
 MSmits: which 2 games? Early game and end game?
 struct: no p1 and p2
 MSmits: oh I see
 MSmits: well that's because p1 has the center cell
 jacek: and over 70% winrate :s
 MSmits: well that 70% is really situational. I think p1 has 100% on perfect play and near 50% with two equally crappy players
 MSmits: the better the bots, the nearer to 100% you get
 MSmits: karliso said he had 96% vs himself or something
 jacek: he played himself
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: 96% o.o
 MSmits: I think the game would be more balanced if it ended on a draw when neither side has 3 in a row
 MSmits: it favors p1 mostly, because p1 often wins more boards
 MSmits: in normal TTT we don't count cells on a draw, p1 will always win then too&#160;:)
 jacek: but we do on counting TTT
 struct: maybe we need to mix in counting TTT
 MSmits: what is counting TTT?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe</a>
 jacek: in there my bot had p1 win over 90% games
 MSmits: hmm 4 in a row counts as 2x 3 in a row? and 5 in a row counts as 3x&#160;?
 jacek: so they are mirrored and focused on score
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: interesting
 MSmits: this game has some nice pruning opporunities it seems
 MSmits: like dont consider squares that are not within range of filled squares
 jacek: maybe even RAVE would work there
 MSmits: maybe yeah
 jacek: i prune edge cells in the beginning
 MSmits: the edge of the board?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/586328505">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/586328505</a>
 jacek: ai has much more score in the beginning but i own him
 struct: game should do wraparound
 struct: and count those cells
 MSmits: tric trac seems to play only neighboring cells
 struct:&#160;:)
 MSmits: that game looks like you're beating him at go :P
 jacek: yeah, suddenly 1 move gives 3 score
 jacek: maybe this time nn should focus on maximizing scores than winrate
 MSmits: maximize score difference but yeah
 struct: if you win you cant lose
 MSmits: sec struct, let me write this one down

 jacek: TAS finishes game in 18:11, while for normal people they gave 20:00 limit ~
 struct: is it AI or just inputs created by the user?
 jacek: TAS - tool assisted speedrun
 jacek: hardcoded moves or algorithm
 jacek: not learning
 woful: :eyeglasses:
 vedantiscool2010: hi 
 vedantiscool2010: m 10
 vedantiscool2010: me 10
 jacek: ohai
 superfast_snail: :clap_tone1:
 Wontonimo: :wave: :wave: speed snail and vedant
 Manjius: is switch case just a glorified chain of if statements
 Astrobytes: in a way yes, but for anything less than say 4 or 5 different cases then just use if-else
 jacek: could be also performance
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if performance matters you should benchmark your switch vs ifs
 MSmits: there must be 100 threads about that on stack overflow :P
 MSmits: I bet each one of them has a guy accusing the poster of premature optimization
 Manjius: i always feel pretentious using switch case
 MSmits: then you should stay with us, the common if-peasants
 struct: I never optimize
 struct: it doesnt matter
 Astrobytes: heh
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct: any of you tried the certify of the language?
 Astrobytes: oh dice duel is potw
 Astrobytes: Nope
 struct: im better than 99% of c++ devs
 struct: gg
 struct: test says it takes 60 minutes
 struct: took me less than some clashes
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: hahaha, dude, you're hired!
 struct: puzzles were very easy  tbf
 struct: I should have said that on the feedback thing
 struct: im sure that one of the puzzles is a clash
 Astrobytes:&#160;:/
 struct: today i found out I can declare vars inside the while (here)
 MSmits: which language?
 struct: c++
 Manjius: the certifications should take time into account
 Astrobytes: code golfing I presume
 Manjius: so not all 100%s are the same
 struct: not golfing I use it on the breakthrough bot now
 adamgosnell: I'm new to coding and working on "The Descent." How do I get the index for a variable in a range that isn't named? 
 struct: instead of doing while(forward_moves) {...};
 Astrobytes: struct: why though?
 adamgosnell: I'm used to [range].indexOf("x")
 struct: i do while(const U64 moves = forward_moves &amp; (forward_moves - 1){...};
 struct: U64 move*
 Astrobytes: it's faster?
 MSmits: yeah why make it look simple when you can horrify people who look at your code :P
 struct: It was for me, maybe compiler does something
 adamgosnell: Nevermind, I've just realized. I'm going to use the "i."
 MSmits: yeah i is usually the iterator
 struct: I also edited another part of the code so its hard to say
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 struct: if you think that looks ugly you should see what I found out today
 struct: on c++ 20
 Astrobytes: show us
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a473e2b8-712c-4a22-b1f3-7020506feebe">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a473e2b8-712c-4a22-b1f3-7020506feebe</a>
 MSmits: c++ must be the only language where later versions look worse
 MSmits: i have no idea what that program does
 Astrobytes: that's not too bad tbh, I can read that
 MSmits: i can't
 Astrobytes: the ranges are something I've been looking forward to
 struct: some claim its faster
 struct: feel free to add it if it is&#160;:)
 MSmits: does this do something for each pair [x, y]&#160;?
 MSmits: each one that  is an element of a?
 struct: isnt that code missing a&#160;; though?
 MSmits: it reads an x and then sets y equal to the iterator?
 struct: in the for loop
 struct: I think thats what it does MSmits
 MSmits: I wonder then what it sorts by
 MSmits: if it's a pair
 MSmits: I guess maybe it sorts by the first element and if that is equal it does the second?
 MSmits: this feels like discussing python stuff where not knowing what stuff does is commonplace&#160;:)
 struct: I never saw ranges::sort
 struct: though
 Manjius: probably
 struct: stackoverflow says its faster
 struct: I trust it
 MSmits: faster than what?
 MSmits: not even sure what this code is supposed to replace
 struct: than std::sort()
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: ranges::sort must be a new kind of sort I guess
 struct: the pair is sorted by the first element by default
 MSmits: I thought they must have figured sorting out by now
 struct: ah I see
 struct: you can do ranges::sort(a);
 struct: instead of sort(a.begin(), a.end());
 struct: looks cleaner I guess
 Manjius: do u have to include ranges.h or something
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hannes.hauswedell.net/post/2019/11/30/range_intro/">https://hannes.hauswedell.net/post/2019/11/30/range_intro/</a>
 struct: its c++ 20 only
 struct: you need &lt;algorithm&gt;
 struct: how many bots would break if c++ was added?
 struct: 20
 MSmits: 20 bots?
 MSmits: do new versions of c++ break older bots?
 struct: dont know
 struct: it might happen I guess
 struct: for me its fine anyways
 struct: i still write c++14
 Astrobytes: distracted by the tennis sorry but doesn't it set x,y to i since it's going over a range of pairs?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44570863-0947-4634-9d41-d59cf53a09cf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44570863-0947-4634-9d41-d59cf53a09cf</a>
 struct: the x takes the value of the input
 struct: y takes the value of i
 Astrobytes: oh, I thought they changed something, that would be how I'd normally read it yeah
 Astrobytes: Also: Congrats to Paula Badosa :tennis: 
 Astrobytes: Need to read up on these ranges
 Astrobytes: C++20 was available in last years RAIC but I stuck with 17
 struct: havent followed tennis in a while
 struct: im trying to setup vscode so it uses c++20
 struct: not an easy task 
 Astrobytes: that's why I stuck with 17 lol
 Astrobytes: Oh I understand the code now, was distracted too much obviously. Kinda useful
 Astrobytes: The women's tennis at least has been interesting this year, new faces and exciting players. Mens has been a little off and on, but a good year I'd say. I lose interest when it gets stagnant
 adamgosnell: Where do I get help on a particular game?
 struct: I guess you can ask here
 struct: which game is it adamgosnell?
 adamgosnell: It was the Descent, but I figured it out. I was making it WAY harder than it needed to be. 
 yhyoxx: some come play with me <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/VkO-36f-xX4-ZnV">https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/VkO-36f-xX4-ZnV</a>
 yhyoxx: someone*
 adamgosnell: I would, but I'm garbage. xD
 yhyoxx: just come in
 yhyoxx: yay
 adamgosnell: I need to play the tutorial first, clearly. That was... intimidating. 
 adamgosnell: brb
 yhyoxx: still having no clue what to do
 Westicles: that's okay, no coding experience is needed
 intheware: hi
 intheware: how long have you guys been coding for
 Thorcode: 3 years
 intheware: oh
 intheware: ive been coding for a couple of months
 intheware: i feel like im not progressing enough
 Thorcode: well try the w3school bro
 TechnoBot: BRB
 intheware: i have
 Westicles: TechnoBot, where are you in the warning/kick/ban progression?
 struct: only 1 of them remaining
 Thorcode: TO my mind I remember that TechnoBot is in kick progression
 TechnoBot:&#160;???????///////
 TechnoBot: IDK what u guys r talking about
 struct: he was kicked once already
 TechnoBot: That's because I didn't know that spam is junk chat
 TechnoBot: btw
 TechnoBot: .
 TechnoBot: Plus, I'm a minecraft player, spam is different there
 TechnoBot: and im new
 TechnoBot: (partly)
 Westicles: I thought you were MK
 TechnoBot:&#160;???????????????/
 struct: well you need to follow the rules here
 TechnoBot: Where are the list of rules???????//
 <b>**TechnoBot says:"WHere are the list of rules???????//"</b>
 TechnoBot: I was asking for the rules!!!!

 struct: it could be westicle, they both seem to play it
 Wontonimo: wow technobot, a little pushy there
 Wontonimo: what are you working on here TechnoBot?  are you doing any puzzles or multis?
 TechnoBot: shhhhh, I'm figuring a puzzle
 Thorcode: nice TechnoBot this is the first time I see you do puzzle
 Thorcode: is there someone finished the gas house in code escape
 bminnix: Lol, 
 Thorcode: we done :D
 bminnix: What was that last one?  I sat back down about the time it said we were done.
 Thorcode: yep
 bminnix: I mean, was it in the 114X range you were trying?
 Thorcode: 1556
 bminnix: Ahh
 bminnix: Geez
 Thorcode: again?
 Thorcode: we could break this score :D
 bminnix: I won't be able to work tomorrow if I do another, lol.  
 bminnix: This took WAAAAAAY longer than I thought it would.
 Thorcode: 1156 not 1556
 adamgosnell: Again? You crazy bro?
 adamgosnell: That one took years off of my life
 Thorcode: no easy we have all ans
 adamgosnell:  I doubt it's going to put us in the same one? 
 bminnix: Are there diff ones?
 Wontonimo: Thorcode, are you flexing your coding skilz on Clash?
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: I was going to congratulate you if you were
 Wontonimo: what score were you talking about (1156?)
 Thorcode: nothing
 adamgosnell: Okay, that didn't take any time at all
 adamgosnell: Lol
 bminnix: Did y'all do it again?
 Thorcode: yep
 bminnix: ... Man...
 Thorcode: top 1%
 Thorcode: nice?
 bminnix: Aside from my absence, yes.
 Westicles: someone finally excited about escape
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: sorry
 bminnix: Lol, I said I wasn't going to do it.
 bminnix: It's all on me.
 adamgosnell: It's MAD easier if you're not like "What the heck does this clue mean"
 Thorcode: again?
 adamgosnell: sure, for bminnix?
 bminnix: I think I have that kind of time.
 adamgosnell: xD
 adamgosnell: AND done
 Thorcode: yep
 adamgosnell: Welcome to the 1% bmixnix
 adamgosnell: xD
 Thorcode: yep
 adamgosnell: Where can I see the highest scores?
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2JV4t2U">https://imgur.com/a/2JV4t2U</a>
 adamgosnell: Yeah, I was hoping for a chart with the highest scorers and their times
 adamgosnell: Alright, I'm headed to bed. 
 adamgosnell: peace dudes
 Thorcode: bye
 bminnix: Yeah, I really am stepping out this time.  You folks have a good night.
 bminnix: Thanks for that run!  Forgot to say that or read above...
 Armangh: is there an "Always share my code" mode i can switch on for clash of code?
 Thorcode: no

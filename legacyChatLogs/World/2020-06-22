 ThunderbirdOne: Clash, that's still a thing?
 ThunderbirdOne: hi everyone btw :D
 code_maniac: Why most of people here don't like clash&#160;?
 code_maniac: I think it can serve as a good tool for people who wan't prepare things where they need to have time bounded environment.
 code_maniac: Yeah invites are still annoying :p 
 tomatoes: interviews?
 Daher: Hey guys, when i submit solution in CoC it take  1 minute to display the result is it normal? 
 tutubalin: no, that's no ok
 code_maniac: @tomatoes yeah can be a good tool for interviews as well, as you get a random question with random mode, so it gives a good practice, shortest mode isn't going to help much there, but other two i think are pretty good
 code_maniac: Also there are lots of good coder, who has lots of knowledge, so that can also help other when they see how people quickly reach to some solutions.They learn some methods or tricks as well from others
 tomatoes: but i dont like interviews
 code_maniac: Well that's a completely different thing, that's your individual choice
 imbadpython: if you want to practice for interviews do leetcode insteaed
 imbadpython: clash of codee queestions are like basic af
 ThunderbirdOne: interviews are just a necessary evil
 tomatoes: because of time bounded environment :neutral_face:
 ThunderbirdOne: most of the time, the complexity of the questions you get dont even reflect the work you get to do
 code_maniac: @imbadpython well yes, but you don't get this time bounded environment there as far as i know,Definitely the question's has to be solvable in given time span
 code_maniac: @tomatoes yeah i do agree on this üëç
 imbadpython: there is
 imbadpython: a interview practice mode
 imbadpython: one hour two questions
 imbadpython: like actual quesetions
 code_maniac: @ imbadpython oh didn't knew that, thanks for info mate&#160;:)
 code_maniac: @ThunderbirdOne yeah, but people do ask irrelevant thing in interviewee‚Äôs also, i.e. JS's like this you need to have 4-5 years experience, you need to Java,Python, JavaScript blah blah üòÇ for the job of junior frontend engineer
 PhucNguyen279: My interviewers said they will send me an interview test here, I'm quite nervous not sure what I'm gonna to do :joy: :joy: :joy:
 Astrobytes: ThunderbirdOne! Hey&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: You let me log into ur account and do it for u
 WINWINWIN: Hi, Im in 12th grade now and Im looking into college choices, I found that most colleges offer "Electrical and Computer Engineering" or Computer Sciencce
 WINWINWIN: But the Electrical and Computer Engineering does not have that many CComputer ccourses
 WINWINWIN: so if I am interested in computer engineering, which one is a better choice?
 Uljahn: being electrical engineer with some cs knowledge looks more valuable to me than just pure cs, but that's because im electrical engineer myself :slight_smile:
 Uljahn: that's about having plan B i guess
 Uljahn: or skills diversification
 Crypticsy: hey hey, kindah out of the blue, but can you guys give some feedback on this?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5140c0ddef4c6cac9083c94a8aa02626bf7d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5140c0ddef4c6cac9083c94a8aa02626bf7d</a>
 Uljahn: LCG is too much for an easy puzzle i guess, that's more like two problems in there
 Uljahn: maybe you could make the main problem a little bit harder and tag the puzzle as medium?
 Crypticsy: I wouldn't have used a LCG if there was a cap for input. But having an explanation at the end and a simple exposure to these things feel like it would be better to be kept at easy
 Crypticsy: felt*
 WINWINWIN: Thanks Uljahn
 tanmaycodernovice: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41e8393f-cf42-4f5c-ae99-a517e6cd4a02">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41e8393f-cf42-4f5c-ae99-a517e6cd4a02</a>
 tanmaycodernovice: can anyone interpret this 
 tanmaycodernovice: reverse mode 
 Migrou: do you mean Test1: 3 4 21Test2: 2 8 20 ?
 Uljahn: x*(x + y)?
 Migrou: sounds like it
 tanmaycodernovice: yess man 
 tanmaycodernovice: nice 
 tanmaycodernovice: but now that is over.. 
 tanmaycodernovice: clash 
 jacek: Oo
 Tim_McSim: Hello!&#160;:)
 jacek: good afternoon
 struct: hello
 Astrobytes: Hi
 struct: Ok, boss uploaded
 Astrobytes: Oh nice one, it got fixed
 darkhorse64: go go go but not too far
 WINWINWIN: How advanced is the Othello boss?
 darkhorse64: It should rank around #9
 darkhorse64: vae victis
 Astrobytes: :D
 WINWINWIN: I come under that bracket&#160;:(
 WINWINWIN: When I couldnt get the minimax working for Othello, I cocpy pasted it to UTTT and changed the eval and simulation
 jacek: boss?
 Astrobytes: Motivation to improve WINWINWIN
 darkhorse64: It's designed to make you sweat
 WINWINWIN: Seems like it :D, when are leagues opening?
 struct: they should be open
 jacek: sweat?
 darkhorse64: When the boss ends its run
 struct: only waiting for boss to finish submit
 struct: but it seems stuck 
 jacek: another bug?
 Astrobytes: It's not moved
 struct: Ill wait 10 minutes to see if it moves or not
 darkhorse64: leaderboard bug likely
 WINWINWIN: Cant even see it on the LB
 WINWINWIN: Is the boss BigUp?
 struct: Boss is BOSS 1
 struct: he is currently rank 10
 WINWINWIN: Then its an LB bug... Field3 is #10
 struct: he is between 10 an 11*
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ I reloaded but still cannot see it, can anyone else see it?
 darkhorse64: 10 3/4
 jacek: hes moving i think
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just real slow
 WINWINWIN: Found it, thanks
 darkhorse64: I see it on the game leaderboard page but not on the global one. You never see boss on the global leaderbaord
 WINWINWIN: Yes, missed thqt
 WINWINWIN: It runs on a minimax?
 tanmaycodernovice: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1265420929c0bbdf82e143cb444edbaa7065375">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1265420929c0bbdf82e143cb444edbaa7065375</a>
 darkhorse64: MCTS. It's a spin off of my Legend UTTT code (with some features removed)
 tanmaycodernovice: guys i need a code 
 tanmaycodernovice: to find out power of a number 
 tanmaycodernovice: like inputs are: 2,4 
 tanmaycodernovice: then output shpuld be 2 
 tanmaycodernovice: in python 
 Astrobytes: Solve it yourself or don't do the clash.
 darkhorse64: pow(2,2) = 4
 WINWINWIN: tanmaycodernovice CoC is not a team sport :D
 tanmaycodernovice: no the reverse way 
 Uljahn: maybe log?
 WINWINWIN: math.log
 tanmaycodernovice: winwinwin nice one 
 Astrobytes: That really annoys me. At least wait until the clash is done, then ask for advice. I mean what's the fking point?
 WINWINWIN: yes
 WINWINWIN: Ruining it for others as well
 tanmaycodernovice: okk trying to solve by myself 
 tanmaycodernovice: btw math.log function didn't work out 
 Uljahn: ofc
 Uljahn: there's some trick involved
 WINWINWIN: Idk about that, probably just gave the inputs in the wrong order and got 0.5
 WINWINWIN: Uljahn when you studied electrical engineering, was communication systems and VLSI combined?
 WINWINWIN: Or were they seperate streams?
 Uljahn: we have different curriculum here
 Uljahn: i studied control systems and power electronics
 Uljahn: or electric drives
 struct: oh no darkhorse64&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: Heard about Frankenstein&#160;?
 struct: :D
 dbdr: only trictrac and me promoted :D
 dbdr: ah no, renard now
 struct: looks so buggy
 jacek: im promoted
 jacek: but leaderboard is so laggy
 struct: I think it's CG
 darkhorse64: Great! I am #1
 Astrobytes: I'm promoted, it's just slow
 dbdr: suddenly Astro in the lb
 dbdr: while I'm playing many other people
 dbdr: ah, now updated
 jacek: ah promotion makes server laggy
 jacek: like csb
 dbdr: yes, too many players on othello&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: so it's 7 players in top league?
 struct: I think so
 dbdr: seems right
 jacek: darkhorse64 you made better boss than your bot?
 dbdr: classic!
 darkhorse64: That clearly demonstrates that the leaderboard is buggy, to quote our famous friend ceg
 tanmaycodernovice: map is returning a object value.. how to convert it to string
 Uljahn: use list()
 Uljahn: then "".join()
 dbdr: the smaller league will actually be good for more precise ranking
 Astrobytes: Yep
 dbdr: you feel precisely ranked Astrobytes?&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Looks about right yeah :D
 dbdr: you did win one against jacek, gg!&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: And it wasn't a timeout!
 tanmaycodernovice: guys like in this 'str.maketrans()' i want to get all the str function. so what should i write on google?
 tanmaycodernovice: pyhton 
 dbdr: python string

 Hanne030: Is it just me or is the site kind of slow today?
 Hjax: not just you 
 darkhorse64: There is a league rerun with 7 players. Server is overloaded
 Hanne030: ah thanks for the info, I started to get worried about my laptop haha
 Hjax: :joy:
 ZeGermans: Is it possible for the expected answer is wrong&#160;?
 Hjax: it is extremely unlikely, but possible 
 ZeGermans: And is there anyway someone can see what you are doing and maybe help or thats not the point of the site&#160;:)
 DiL: Hi everyone! Site is very slow and sometimes I got 504 network errors. Possibly an issue with clashes?
 Astrobytes: ZeGermans thats not the point of the site
 Hjax: people are happy to help you if you have questions
 jacek: too many people play othello
 Hjax: but we wont give you the answer
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: nerf othello plx
 darkhorse64: Hey guys, I'm back&#160;!
 Astrobytes: grats darkhorse64 :D
 Astrobytes: You have defeated your creation at last
 darkhorse64: It's a good feeling to get promoted. Yes, but not by a wide margin. java_coffee_cup made it difficult
 darkhorse64: Here, it's even more difficult 1 win of out 16
 Astrobytes: I had 1 in 44 earlier :D
 darkhorse64: 2 against you now
 tanmaycodernovice: is anyone here studying networking? that compression of ipv6
 jacek: another clash question?
 ZeGermans: Ok here it is im stuck on this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators</a>
 tanmaycodernovice: actually i'm trying to code for my exams.. so that it becomes easy to solve numericals 
 tanmaycodernovice: can we remove a found string with regular expression from original string
 ZeGermans: So if anyone has solved it im doing the following: convert the input string to array, convert all log and lat to doubles, calculate the formula and save it in the array. Then sort the arrays based on the distance, get the first and print out the name
 ZeGermans: 1,2 and 4 testcases pass 
 ZeGermans: the 3rd is showing me that it is expecting something else 
 Hjax: the submission test cases or the practice ones? 
 ZeGermans: The complete file one 
 Hjax: so you can see what the expected answer is 
 ZeGermans: Yes i did and it ranks lower on my list 
 Hjax: add some debug prints to your code, find out why your program thinks thats not the correct answer 
 ZeGermans: I did a lot of those all the conversions are correct but im gonna do the math on a calculator to see if that checksout
 Astrobytes: And if you want to test a particular detail you can create custom test  cases too
 dbdr: darkhorse64, you are bringing people's rating down when they beat you :D
 struct: I still see darkhorse in wood 2
 struct: something is wrong with this site
 dbdr: lag
 Astrobytes: This is worse than a contest
 dbdr: nice to be in two leagues at once
 darkhorse64: I know. I do not deserve to be here
 darkhorse64: Should I delete my account&#160;?
 struct: I guess it's just maintenance
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: ask the expert
 struct: This is not normal, there was lag before I submited the boss
 Astrobytes: Report it on discord
 dbdr: I think the othello wood 1 leadberboard is clear: C++ is a poor language
 darkhorse64: We are legion
 dbdr: quantity, not quality
 darkhorse64: Zerg rush on your pawns
 darkhorse64: that's the strat
 ZeGermans: Hjax 
 ZeGermans: Do you have this one solved 
 ZeGermans: Or anyone who has this one solved <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators</a>I'd be glad if you could just rerun your code and tell me if it passes
 Hjax: i do not, i can try it 
 ZeGermans: Ty so much 
 Tucos: ZeGermans, i did solve that one (and my solution still passes that etst). Note that the given formula is unnecessarily complicated
 darkhorse64: 53000 people solved it
 MSmits: damn cheaters
 Tucos: The forums page also mentions someone with the same issue on that test, so i think the other formula might work better
 Astrobytes: All my testcases pass ZeGermans
 ZeGermans: Where can i see the other formula Tucos 
 Tucos: Left of the IDE there's a link to the forum topic for that test
 MSmits: are you fighting ww2 Astrobytes?
 tanmaycodernovice: FE82:0:0:0:0:1A12:1234:1A12
 Astrobytes: Click the forum link to the left ZeGermans
 tanmaycodernovice: can anyine create a regex for this 
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 tanmaycodernovice: to get :0:0:0:0: like this 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all mine pass ZeGermans
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's actually a puzzle i did in java, cause i needed Double
 ZeGermans: Thank you so much guys, solved it ^_^
 tanmaycodernovice: can u guys please help me 
 tanmaycodernovice: not a clash lol 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess Wood1 opened
 Astrobytes: Site still slow for everyone?
 MSmits: been slow for me for a day or two I think
 MSmits: still slow now 
 MostComplicatedUsername: No it seems to be working at normal speed for me
 MSmits: I only have problems when loading IDE
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh nvm test replays are slow
 struct: I doubt a 8 player rerun caused this
 Astrobytes: Well, I mentioned it on dicsord
 Astrobytes: *discord lol
 tanmaycodernovice: tanmaysinghal380Today at 8:01 PM'FE82:0:0:0:0:1A12:1245:1A12' i want to create a regex for it that matches ':0:0:0:0:' this part in a single list only
 Astrobytes: Excuse me, but demanding we help you with your homework or whatever it is will not get you anywhere.
 Astrobytes: Google it.
 tanmaycodernovice: dude i've tried it many times 
 tanmaycodernovice: but can't get it right 
 tanmaycodernovice: it is showing me in 2 values in list.. but i want it in 0 
 Astrobytes: Cross-posting the same question to the Discord is generally considered rude. Particularly since it is not even related to CG.
 tanmaycodernovice: really?
 tanmaycodernovice: my bad 
 Squidgoat: i know that somewhere on discord there's a computer programming help room
 tanmaycodernovice: there isn't
 Hjax: that easy puzzle took me way longer than it should have, who gives inputs in long/lat instead of lat/long 
 Squidgoat: work on your googlefu...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/invite/vh7ScS">https://discord.com/invite/vh7ScS</a>
 Zerplin: the thor puzz?
 Squidgoat: i literally just googled "discord computer programming help room"
 Astrobytes: *A wild Zerplin appears!*
 Hjax: the defibrillators puzzle @Zerplin
 Astrobytes: long time no see
 Zerplin: hello Astrobytes
 Hjax: it took me an extra 10 minutes to realize i had lat and long switched, oops 
 Zerplin: i'm surprised ppl still remember me, lol
 struct: Can Java get wood 1 on othello?
 Astrobytes: You're forever immortalised because of euler's Bender puzzle
 Zerplin: glad to hear that&#160;:), it was a ton of fun working on it 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Hjax: i didnt get a chance to work on ghost in the cell this weekend, i still plan to try to get legend in one submit
 Astrobytes: lol, I forgot about your plan :D
 darkhorse64: struct: how high is the boss now&#160;?
 struct: 30.75
 struct: java is 29.00
 darkhorse64: Unlikely to get pushed
 MSmits: should have gone with C#
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 darkhorse64: Not too late. 
 Hjax: C# Coffee Cup when 
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: i am looking at Othello atm
 Astrobytes: C# Cup
 MSmits: move generation doesn't seem easy
 MSmits: but maybe i'll find a quick way
 struct: There should be a few articles on it
 MSmits: yeah
 Zerplin: actually returned here to practice some c#
 MSmits: nice
 Zerplin: yeah seems much more feasible now that i've done some oop in js 
 darkhorse64: bitboarding Othello moves is well documented 
 Hjax: the article i saw just generated all permutations for a single row, and kept a few rotations of the board 
 Hjax: then move generation is just indexing into an array 
 struct: notifications not working?
 struct: ah it works now
 struct: just very slow
 Zerplin: wish you could have several ratings on stuff like gitc depending your language
 Zerplin: depending on'
 jacek: ohai
 struct: euler online?
 dbdr: why not ping him?
 jacek: achtung minen
 dbdr: when you are white, you need to handle the first time specially, right?
 dbdr: since it's not expert format yet
 struct: yeah
 struct: also for black
 dbdr: well, for black at least nothing happened
 struct: but if you read it will go out of sync
 struct: you must add an if()
 dbdr: right
 struct: Now I know that I must add this before game releases
 dbdr: you mean expert mode for all?
 dbdr: non-optional?
 struct: I should have had this input has default
 struct: as*
 struct: But game was already released
 dbdr: yeah, simpler than the choice
 struct: Next game will be 3D
 Hjax: do 4D tic tac toe 
 struct: why stop at 4D?
 dbdr: rand(10)D
 Hjax: i was literally typing the same joke as dbdr
 Hjax: i was just slower 
 struct: checkers puzzle of the week
 Hjax: 4d tic tac toe is played on the same board as UTTT
 hanzhere: how to create custom coding game?

 struct: Is this it jacek?
 jacek:&#160;?
 struct: othello
 jacek: is this what&#160;:?
 struct: the submit
 jacek: i improved some things apparently
 TheSpiffiest: Man I am addicted to this Coders Strike back thing.  Gold league you get two cars.  Went from just hitting targets to classes and algorithms.
 TheSpiffiest: I didn't think Covid lay off would actually be fun.
 jacek: and now we know the root of site's sluggishness
 Astrobytes: Nah he got gold yesterday jacek
 jacek: and probably pushed others to legend
 TheSpiffiest: It's been about 30 hours, you give me too much credit good and bad I think
 Astrobytes: yesterday yeah, CSB is fine rn
 TheSpiffiest: Maybe after 3 days you can blame me for site troubles.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: i blame celestia
 TheSpiffiest: It does seem to lose game state every half hour or so it seems and I have to reload
 TheSpiffiest: Is there at status screen like AWS for each game?
 TheSpiffiest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://status.codingame.com/">http://status.codingame.com/</a> - looks like it
 Astrobytes: Nah
 Astrobytes: CSB viewer crashes sometimes, goes black and needs reloading
 Astrobytes: Site's currently just slow, staff are monitoring it
 Astrobytes: Almost there jacek
 jacek: im curious what secret tric will reveal this time
 Astrobytes: lol
 Reksio: Any idea what they are running it on? Lambda, containers, azure functions?
 Astrobytes: It's their own custom container-based solution I believe
 Astrobytes: In contrast to tech.io (the 'Learn' tab) which uses Docker
 Reksio: maybe they use k8s
 Reksio: well, anything own explains the slowdown
 TheSpiffiest: Looks like /services/TestSession/play accepts post data for a game... that unpacks it, passes it to a compiler, parses output to string, runs that against game specific code from referrer, returns that as a json array of frames with positions, then the local game animates that dataset... you could possibly make a recursive memory bomb depending on how the spawn your code if you were a bad guy.
 TheSpiffiest: just looking at network traffic anyway
 jacek: well there was some troublesome submit which cause zombie process
 Astrobytes: Topic referenced here (in case anyone is interested):<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/killed-on-c-memory-reservations/140640">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/killed-on-c-memory-reservations/140640</a>
 Reksio: yeah, this kind of problem can kill even cloud functions
 Astrobytes: And that's defo not the issue this time around
 Reksio: I was referring to Jacke's statement
 Astrobytes: So was I&#160;;)
 Reksio: so no zombie processes?
 Astrobytes: No, that manifested itself as a whole other set of issues
 Reksio: I hope everything will be eventually consistent eventually&#160;;)
 TheSpiffiest: well it's straight C. Hopefully the filter out malloc calls&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: They'll sort it out, always do
 TheSpiffiest: One memory please
 Hjax: that error reminds me of an error battlecode had 
 Hjax: every api called leaked some memory in the engine, but the engine would blame your bot for the missing memory, too many API calls and your bot would be killed for running out of memory, even if it wasnt even close to running out 
 Hjax: api call*
 Astrobytes: lol, well played
 Hjax: it was very annoying 
 Hjax: bot doing great, maybe winning
 Hjax: suddenly, Error: Killed
 Hjax: this was during the sprint tournament mind you
 struct: Astrobytes hard league?
 jacek: easy league
 Hjax: it felt like we were playing Russian roulette, if our bot could win the game before it died
 dbdr: nice jacek!
 dbdr: what's new?
 struct: jacek you want me to make tric trac boss?
 Astrobytes: lol, trying some stuff out struct, and yeah. Good job jacek man!
 struct: ah wait
 struct: too late
 jacek: that would be too easy boss :v
 dbdr: agreed
 struct: Just wait for his next submit :D
 jacek: now lets await trics revenge
 jacek: i think im still scratching surface of tuning eval
 dbdr: someone's going to be upset
 Astrobytes: oh lol, grats dbdr
 Astrobytes: woops, spoke too soon :zipper_mouth:
 dbdr: just lost one, but it's still early
 Hjax: man you guys are really working hard on othello
 Astrobytes: Well, they are. I'm failing hard :D
 Hjax: rank 7 is what we call failing now is it?
 jacek: 7 out of 8? yes
 Hjax: much better than what i would come up with
 struct: Still no books
 dbdr: that's it, I finally earned your respect jacek? :D
 Hjax: poor tric
 Hjax: he just wants to chill at rank 1 
 Astrobytes: I'll have you know I was 6th earlier, I'm 'actively working on it'
 Hjax: dbdr how long have you known rust for? 
 dbdr: 1.5 years
 Hjax: do you program it professionally? or just use it for hobby projects?
 Astrobytes: I remember when you started using CG to practice it 
 dbdr: just for hobby/CG
 jacek: do people use rust professionally?
 dbdr: sure, Mozilla, Microsoft, Dropbox, ...
 Hjax: yeah mozilla is huge on rust 
 dbdr: all use rust to some degree
 Astrobytes: It's pretty well established now, and more people are coming round to it
 Hjax: my last few attempts to learn C++ have ended with me hating myself, i wonder if I would like rust better
 Hjax: im spoiled by java and python holding my hand 
 dbdr: well, rustc will hold your hand too
 dbdr: a typical crash or memory corruption in C++ will be a compilation error in rust
 Hjax: yeah that is what makes it appealing 
 struct: Hjax go for it
 Hjax: ive been reading "the book" 
 Hjax: but i havent tried to write anything yet 
 dbdr: I started with CG puzzles&#160;:)
 dbdr: but it's a good idea to follow the book
 Astrobytes: Do CG puzzles with it
 dbdr: there's also exercism that's pretty nice
 jacek: you cant learn "good looking" code with puzzles o.O
 Hjax: oh exercism is a course? that looks neat
 struct: you learn it by playing CoC
 Astrobytes: No, you can do that elsewhere
 Astrobytes: Never seen that exercism before
 Hjax: me either, it looks like a pretty well made site 
 jacek: unlike CG :v
 Hjax: ill take a look at it, thanks for the suggestion dbdr
 struct: is performance on par with c++ on CG?
 dbdr: to be fair, CG is much more complex than exercism to make
 dbdr: yes, except in IDE
 struct: So if you want to create an opening book
 struct: it will be way harder right?
 dbdr: depends how you want to do it
 Astrobytes: Hey, Wood 1 Thales crew all offline... what are they planning... :P
 dbdr: but you can work around the IDE speed issue
 dbdr: sending a compiled binary
 struct: ah
 dbdr: hopefully CG will do something about it too
 dbdr: issue with C# and rust now...
 jacek: dont blame on issues now!
 Astrobytes: Didn't they say on discord they had no plans to do anything about it?
 tomatoes: exercism had very slow mentor reply when i tried it
 dbdr: mentor is optional, you can skip it if you want
 struct: They made a poll Astrobytes
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/A9dfQoH.png">https://i.imgur.com/A9dfQoH.png</a>
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, forgot about that
 dbdr: [CG]Thibault voted for both :D
 struct: Just so both are available 
 dbdr: ah yes
 jacek: :s
 dbdr: darkhorse64 you time out: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/474007427">https://www.codingame.com/replay/474007427</a>
 jacek: he just saw a lose and didnt bother to continue
 dbdr: jacek: I'll try to pull tric down as well&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: In Clash of Code, it would be nice to vote other people up for sharing their code
 TheSpiffiest: I am learning a lot by just seeing what others did. Would be nice to award them for it.
 dbdr: you can do that in puzzles, btw
 TheSpiffiest: I'll check that out
 struct: But you need to solve it first
 TheSpiffiest: So projectEuler.net like
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: how many matches are there per submit?
 dbdr: subjectively, it seems to vary
 struct: I think its 100
 struct: or 90
 struct: not sure
 struct: Astrobytes knows I think
 dbdr: I'm at 60 with 75%
 dbdr: maybe I got more because other ppl were submitting
 Astrobytes: I do? 90 iirc
 TheSpiffiest: So what's a puzzle? I see bot programming, code golf and optimization.  Is there another category?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 struct: on practice
 struct: tab
 Hjax: wait we can upload a binary to codingame? 
 struct: not on contests
 Astrobytes: Only in multis not contest yeah
 Hjax: i see
 dbdr: you can upload a source code
 dbdr: a source code can contain data
 dbdr: data can represent a binary, or anything else
 dbdr: hm, not getting any new matches
 eulerscheZahl: i just logged in, not sure how much on topic: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary">https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary</a>
 dbdr: on topic
 Hjax: fancy 
 Hjax: why is it considered a cheat for contests? because you can bundle 3rd party libraries? 
 RoboStac: because they want to be able to detect copyied / shared code
 Astrobytes: Which can't be done if it's obfuscated in some way
 Hjax: are other means of obfuscating also considered a cheat? 
 dbdr: yes
 Astrobytes: For the reason robo stated
 Hjax: i see 
 Hjax: didnt know that 
 Hjax: not that ive ever tried to obfuscate my code on here, 
 Kirliash: hi
 eulerscheZahl: but fine for multiplayers, as they are "a zoo" according to SaiksyApo
 dbdr: are we the animals?
 Hjax: thats why we can have someone in guru with entirely copy pasted bots? 
 dbdr: well, I know of a toad...
 Astrobytes: lol, always ready with that quote euler :D
 dbdr: an owl
 dbdr: a cat
 dbdr: a fox
 Hjax: dont forget about the duck 
 eulerscheZahl: some users obfuscated to some degree because of the 100k chars (no intentation, shortened var names)
 Hjax: there are several cats in the zoo 
 eulerscheZahl: actually it's Marchete who found that qoute so funny
 Astrobytes: More like a farm really 
 Hjax: cats that come to mind, Astrobytes, teccles, karliso 
 eulerscheZahl: recar
 Astrobytes: and Uljahn
 dbdr: acat
 Hjax: lol so many cats 
 dbdr: isn't recar a small dog?
 eulerscheZahl: i did not write the same as Astrobytes :o
 Astrobytes: More like a veterinary practice
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/5748080bdc5c200a1a70f8f64fe93326401494">https://www.codingame.com/profile/5748080bdc5c200a1a70f8f64fe93326401494</a>no dog has such ears
 Hjax: what happened to teccles, i havent seen him in here for the last few constests 
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, was wondering too
 Astrobytes: He reckoned these contests were taking up too much of his time
 Astrobytes: Guess he'll return at some point
 eulerscheZahl: because they can't play in inoryy mode
 Hjax: sad, hes fun to compete against, because hes usually so active in chat while hes smashing everyone
 Astrobytes: That was just before OOC I think
 Astrobytes: lol inoryy mode, one weekend
 eulerscheZahl: exactly :D
 Astrobytes: yeah, nice fella as well Hjax
 Hjax: ive talked to inoryy a good bit in the starcraft ai discord, he knows his stuff 
 Astrobytes: Sure does. Also a nice guy
 Astrobytes: Loads of nice people on here actually
 dbdr: only one computing in CSB. what's going on?
 Astrobytes: Cause MK is no longer with us
 Hjax: what was the original reason CSB had so many people? 
 struct: Othello &gt; CSB confirmed
 dbdr: I think servers are down too
 Hjax: i just know the jokes about it, not the actually backstory 
 Astrobytes: It's the 'tutorial' multi
 Hjax: ah 
 Hjax: so its just flooded by terrible bots from newbies? 
 dbdr: the bottom 95K, yes
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: have submits stopped dbdr?
 struct: i would even say 99k
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr:&#160;:/
 Hjax: i was about to say, my bot is rank 1303 and its like, 5 lines of code
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: OK, I'll add it to the discord, I reported the issues earlier
 Hjax: its definitely terrible 
 Hjax: the bare minimum to get 4000 cp
 Astrobytes: hey eulerscheZahl, zerplin has returned btw&#160;:)
 karliso: Hjax lynx
 Astrobytes: Still technically a cat karliso&#160;;)
 Hjax: lynxes are cats! 
 Hjax: i stand by my statement :P 
 eulerscheZahl: i occasionally see zerp online on discord
 jacek: derp
 Astrobytes: Felidae
 Astrobytes: He came back to CG to practice C#
 Hjax: what are the other common types of profile pictures, anime girls are pretty common 
 jacek: colorful horses
 derjack: eeyup
 Astrobytes: That's a pony.
 Astrobytes: Again.
 Hjax: i like that Thibaud has a starcraft picture 
 eulerscheZahl: he does?
 Hjax: yeah, its Mira Han
 <b>**eulerscheZahl never played starcraft</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: Thanks Hjax, the name had been bothering me for some time :D
 Hjax: theres a few starcraft references around here, A*Craft of course, also Automaton2000
 Astrobytes: Ages since I played
 Automaton2000: and do the same thing
 dbdr: Astrobytes: I resubmitted and it's working
 Astrobytes: Cool, thx dbdr
 dbdr: mentioned it on discord
 Astrobytes: Nice one
 dbdr: someone knows from what size the 10 ranking games are played?
 dbdr: they aren't on a league of 8 for sure&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that was ever mentioned in public
 eulerscheZahl: only that it's up to 10 games but an be less on smaller leagues
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was real fun earlier when I had 10 games against you, jacek, tric and the fox :P
 dbdr: true, I saw 3 before
 dbdr: I think that's fairly recent, no?
 darkhorse64: looks like the rule is (min(league_size/10), 10)
 dbdr: darkhorse64 reversed it&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I did worse than that in professional life
 eulerscheZahl: min(10, max(league_size, 10))
 dbdr: you reverse professionally?
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355</a>ready for approval
 dbdr: it's a minimax!
 eulerscheZahl: or refusal
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's Go
 eulerscheZahl: whih will be auto-rejected in 18h
 jrke: yeah
 darkhorse64: No, but sometimes it is good to guess how software works (or does not) to explain the authors how to fix it
 Astrobytes: nice dbdt
 Astrobytes: *dbdr
 struct: replays get a bit laggy on atari go
 struct: at least on level 3
 struct: boss vs boss
 Hjax: is there a rule against go or chess in multis? 
 Astrobytes: No
 Hjax: obviously they are pretty overdone 
 Hjax: but i still find it surprising we dont have either game
 Astrobytes: I think they'd be fine on here
 struct: I thought about it
 Hjax: riddles had go, not away of anyone doing chess 
 Hjax: aware* 
 struct: But my main problem
 struct: is fixed time per turn
 Hjax: it would be nice if we could do increment 
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: The game has crashed. Please contact the author and enclose the following error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48aeb11e-1a3e-45aa-8cc1-5f907f196e9f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48aeb11e-1a3e-45aa-8cc1-5f907f196e9f</a>
 Astrobytes: yeah, indeed
 TheSpiffiest: huh... I think the temperature puzzle is wrong.  It says if you find 5 and -5 return 5, but when you do it says it expected -5
 struct: Holy
 struct: Euler
 struct: what did he do
 darkhorse64: the puzzle is right; your code is wrong
 struct: Replay is 1000000 bytes
 eulerscheZahl: redraw the full board each frame?
 struct: 1,000,000
 eulerscheZahl: had to close the tab
 Astrobytes: Approval-ready eh
 Hjax: the other feature i would like a lot would be the ability to play against bots as a human 
 eulerscheZahl: or it would have killed the browser
 Hjax: a decent number of the games here would be easy for a human to interact with 
 Astrobytes: You can make your own ui and do it locally
 eulerscheZahl: but i see no way to integrate it on CG. sounds like a lot of effort
 Hjax: yeah its not useful, its just fun 
 struct: yeah the max you could do is just a javscript bot
 struct: on module
 eulerscheZahl: i made the local player for wondev woman
 struct: and let you play vs it
 eulerscheZahl: with brotaltester
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code</a>
 struct: Smash the code has this
 struct: where you play vs yourself
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 struct: click on viewer
 struct: before playing a match
 struct: click here to start a demo
 Hjax: wow, thats a lot of effort for something i bet basically no one uses 
 Hjax: but yeah, imagine that but against a bot 
 Hjax: wouldnt it be fun 
 struct: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: ah, with arrow keys vs wasd
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: didn't know, won't use
 dbdr: "learn something dumb everyday"
 Hjax: increment would be amazing though, i really wish we had it 
 eulerscheZahl: about a month ago i learned that STC has a debug view
 struct: Hjax also instead of increment
 struct: I would rather have like "timebank"
 struct: Dont know what is called
 eulerscheZahl: i understand the timebank
 struct: Like you would have fixed time to run the bot
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what you mean with increment
 struct: increment is adding time after move
 eulerscheZahl: ah, similar concept
 Hjax: yeah, like a chess clock 
 Hjax: you start with 1 second in the bank, you gain 50 ms every time you move 
 Hjax: use your time however you want, just dont hit 0 
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC has something like that
 struct: If they shared the time ammount that player still has available
 struct: I would port chess
 eulerscheZahl: and a generous total timelimit that turns out to be small per turn becuase there are so many turns
 Hjax: thats why the increment is important 
 eulerscheZahl: they had a rocket league contest with a 5 minute realtime match.and played it with 60FPS
 eulerscheZahl: up to 6min per bot for computation time of a single match
 Hjax: have the cg devs been asked to add an increment mode and said no?
 Astrobytes: Hit them with a feature request struct, gl with that :P
 eulerscheZahl: yes Hjax
 struct: I asked for it before
 struct: I tried measuring time that player uses
 struct: but is not reliable
 eulerscheZahl: such thing was suggested several times by different users
 Hjax: oh you tried to do it in the ref? 
 struct: yeah
 Hjax: i see 
 eulerscheZahl: then again it would screw up with the CG system. the referee always assumes that you use the max time given to you per turn
 Hjax: you could do a silly timebank, where bots can request an extra turn without making a move 
 Hjax: that would work in ref lol
 eulerscheZahl: if you accumulate lots of time and the get 500ms/turn at some point, CG assumes you really take that long and kills the game after 30s in total
 eulerscheZahl: the extra turn could work, true
 eulerscheZahl: adds an extra frame to the replay but no biggie
 Hjax: kind of an ugly work around, but it would work 
 Hjax: its just kind of a shame that you get 1000 ms on the first frame, but if you have a book it goes to waste 
 dbdr: you would need to ping to switch to the second half of the turn?
 Hjax: yeah you would just think for 50 ms and then output "MORE TIME" as your move 
 Hjax: and then keep thinking next turn 
 dbdr: make it MOAR TIME
 Hjax: ^ i like it 
 struct: I see a small problem with this though
 struct: Game is 30 sec max, despite which player uses it
 struct: So a player could have used 20 sec vs 10 sec
 Hjax: give each agent a limited number of MOAR TIME requests 
 Hjax: that they can budget throughout the game 
 Astrobytes: Seems fiddly to implement
 Hjax: to ensure that the game doesnt go over the 30 seconds limit 
 Hjax: im not sure how many moves you would want to force a draw in chess, 150? 
 Hjax: its not like we would be doing tablebase adjudications like tcec does 
 Astrobytes: Can you imagine the server strain
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: im not sure how much exploration has been done with 50 ms per move chess 
 Astrobytes: oooh tric is coming
 Hjax: does stockfish even do something decent in that time? 
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's why I think it would be interesting Hjax
 Astrobytes: (wrt 50ms limit)
 Hjax: leela can probably just play on policy in 50 ms
 Hjax: and be really strong 
 Astrobytes: I'm not current with the latest versions of the big chess engines tbh
 struct: 50ms is more than enough to beat me
 Hjax: leela is a alphazero copycat, based on the papers deepmind released, two outputs from the neural net "value" who is winning, and "policy" what moves look the most promising 
 Hjax: leela plays pretty strong chess even if you just output the policys favorite move 
 Hjax: with no search 
 jacek: chess, here? tcec style or from the beginnig?
 jacek: i wonder how that would be the opening fest
 Astrobytes: nice Hjax, Stockfish still alphabeta based I take it?
 Hjax: i feel like with only 50 ms per move and no tablebases, chess here would be decisive even with no tcec book 
 Hjax: yeah stockfish is a conventional alphabeta engine, free / open source and ridiculously strong 
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know it's strength :D
 Hjax: the tcec superfinal is happening right now, stockfish is beating up leela 
 eulerscheZahl: lastweektonight just taught me something new: jail&#160;!= prison :o
 jacek: why would it be ==?
 eulerscheZahl: both is about incarcerating people
 eulerscheZahl: i always thought these words are synonyms
 Astrobytes: Prison is long-term, a jail is generally in the police station
 struct: Just make 4 player chess
 struct: no more problems
 Hjax: i would be surprised if chess here was draw heavy 
 eulerscheZahl: in German we have the simple word "Untersuchungshaft" for jail :D
 Hjax: not enough time / no tablebases 
 Hjax: someone will blunder 
 jacek: german is beautiful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/256/637/c13.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/256/637/c13.jpg</a>
 struct: Well with 150 you could do around 200ms
 struct: 150 turns*
 Astrobytes: Kinda translates to "custody", which works for here too
 Hjax: i feel like giving really limited time is kind of fun for chess though, forces people to be clever 
 Hjax: rather than just searching deep with lots of speed optimizations 
 Astrobytes: Jail is kind-of a US term I think
 Astrobytes: You underestimate the ability of CG'ers to pack books into their bots Hjax :P
 Hjax: chess books are also cool 
 struct: Well I could do arimaa
 struct: and rip books
 Hjax: chess opening theory is very deep and complex 
 jacek: and crushed by NN zeros
 struct: or chess960
 Astrobytes: I like the idea of chess960 (Fischer Random) as I've said previously
 Hjax: chess960 would be cool 
 Astrobytes: less book, more chess
 Astrobytes: *moar, sorry
 Astrobytes: In fact, that could be the title of the multi
 jacek: chess69
 Hjax: multis are written in java right? 
 Astrobytes: Trust you to lower the tone jacek
 Astrobytes: Yeah Hjax
 Kirliash: hi
 jacek: ohai
 Hjax: thats convenient if i ever decide to write a multi 
 struct: Just dont follow my multis as a guide
 jacek: but i followed when i made mine D:
 Astrobytes: Pony magic
 eulerscheZahl: make sure the board is randomly generated and not just the same starting for each game
 Astrobytes: Other than chess, do you have some ideas Hjax?
 eulerscheZahl: don't tell!
 eulerscheZahl: not if it could be a possible contest
 Astrobytes: That's chess960/Fischer Random eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, didn't read all the chat&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: back to last week tonight
 Astrobytes: And yeah, not asking to disclose, just wondering if he had some ideas
 Hjax: i havent really put any thought into the idea that i could write a multi before this moment 
 Astrobytes: Well, put that Java knowledge to use eh
 jacek: submits stopped again?
 Astrobytes: No, tric's submit seems to be working
 Astrobytes: Maybe slow?
 Astrobytes: No, seems OK actually
 Hjax: i dont think any multi i would come up with would make a good contest, id probably just be reimplementing an existing game 
 Hjax: im not incredibly creative 
 Astrobytes: Never say never
 struct: What if player could choose starting positions?
 struct: Would it be too random?
 Astrobytes: And original games are mostly collaborations too
 Astrobytes: For chess960?
 struct: yeah
 struct: So it wouldnt be mirrored
 Hjax: i feel like that would eliminate a lot of the positions 
 Astrobytes: Doesn't seem like there's a point to that
 Hjax: some of them are just horrible 
 Hjax: and would be a free loss if picked
 struct: ok, I don't know a lot about chess
 struct: I only played a few games, I'm very low rated
 Hjax: im a roughly average chess player
 Astrobytes: I hardly play these days, was a lot better when I was younger
 LelouchVC2: I shall eliminate all chess players with my superior power
 struct: Hjax if you end up making it pm me or something
 struct: So we dont end up both making it
 Hjax: if you want to make it its all yours 
 struct: Nah, I have something else to do atm
 Hjax: i wouldnt even start until after im done with ghost in the cell
 Astrobytes: Remember, if you don't get Legend in that single submit you have to delete your account Hjax
 Hjax: ouch 
 Hjax: i dont intend to delete my account :P
 Hjax: guess ive got to make sure my bot is perfect
 Astrobytes: struct really raised the bar for failure
 Hjax: should have called it ghost in the terminal, because you know.... shell 
 Astrobytes: Doesn't trip off the tongue quite as nicely though
 Hjax: true 
 struct: Chess wouldnt take a lot fo time to port right?
 struct: Like 1 or 2 days should be done right?
 Hjax: not really, but i havent written a multi before 
 Astrobytes: Ghost in the csh
 Hjax: i also find it amusing that ghost in the shell sounds more codingame esque than ghost in the cell 
 Hjax: since the normal scheme is to insert a coding pun into an existing name 
 Astrobytes: Yes, very true
 Shagufta_Siddique: anyone else who has done code how time flies in c++ 
 struct: If I do make it, I will try both variants
 Astrobytes: Host in the Shell would be a nice CTF name
 Hjax: you could just write 960, standard chess is one of the 960 starting positions 
 struct: 1 / 960 :D
 Hjax: right, but if you decided you didnt like 960
 Shagufta_Siddique: i need to submit it tomorrow as my semester project , anyone who can help
 Hjax: you could just force the right starting position 
 struct: yeah nothing will change
 Hjax: might be interesting to do like, 50/50 standard chess and 960
 Hjax: like pump up the odds of normal chess 
 Hjax: but still have 960 
 Astrobytes: Intriguing idea
 struct: or let players choose
 struct: if they want both 960 is 100%
 Hjax: lol they vote on it? thats clever 
 Astrobytes: hmm...
 struct: Yeah, you can do that
 struct: if its 50/50
 struct: too bad
 Astrobytes: This would not stop book play though
 Hjax: it wouldnt, but it would weaken it 
 Hjax: i dont hate books 
 struct: Books are also part of the strategy
 Astrobytes: No me neither, just would be fun to have anti-book chess
 struct: Its  a bit different from uttt books
 Astrobytes: You can't book 960
 Hjax: you could do some automated book generation for 960
 Astrobytes: Well, I guess you could to an extent
 Hjax: just do a deep search from each starting position and cache the result 
 Astrobytes: But it wouldn't be a book small enough to use on CG
 Hjax: you could probably fit a 3 or 4 ply book 
 Hjax: for all of the starting positions
 Hjax: with good compression 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, sounds about right
 Astrobytes: BUT, it might be totally useless in 960
 Astrobytes: As traditional opening theory doesn't apply
 Hjax: but if you are generating it with a deep search
 Hjax: then it doesnt matter 
 Astrobytes: So once you're off book, many lines are possible that you might not have anticipated
 Astrobytes: If you see where I'm coming from
 Hjax: sure, you probably wont win in book 
 Hjax: but you probably can get some edge consistently 
 Astrobytes: Would be interesting to see!
 Hjax: maybe i should write an othello bot before i try chess 960
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Hjax: too many games, not enough time 
 Hjax: unless i want to be coffee cup 2.0, i really need to use rust or c for othello
 Hjax: which is why ive avoided it and similar games until now 
 Astrobytes: Well, no time like the present eh&#160;;)
 Snef: otherwise you do python Hjax&#160;?
 Astrobytes: But finish GitC first ofc
 Hjax: im comfortable writing both java and python 
 Hjax: and horribly uncomfortable writing anything else 
 Hjax: my pr2 bot is python, my utg bot is java 
 Astrobytes: Write your Othello bot in either and port it after?
 Astrobytes: Porting from one language to another is always a useful learning experience
 Hjax: so i tried to do that for pacman 
 Astrobytes: During the contest?
 Hjax: yes 
 Hjax: because my monte carlo was too slow in java 
 Snef: i was doing my bots in java 3 years ago and started doing them in c++, it's not that different tbh
 Astrobytes: Less pressure outside of contest&#160;;)
 Hjax: and i discovered i leaned on a bunch of things in java that i couldnt easily rewrite in c
 Hjax: especially given the time constraint 
 Hjax: i ended up just giving up on pacman on friday, and not doing anything on saturday or sunday 
 Hjax: im too used to garbage collection lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you can write C++ in that Java-ish style, then optimise afterwards
 Astrobytes: It becomes C with some C++ features
 Hjax: i forget what i hit my head on in C++ while trying to port pacman 
 Snef: Astrobytes do you use c++ fancy stuff&#160;?
 Hjax: but i remember being frustrated with it 
 Astrobytes: What 'fancy stuff' Snef?
 Snef: i mean, i do c++ but i feel i use 5% of the lang
 Snef: like i only use class / pointer
 Snef: bitboard..
 Hjax: i think it was the arrays in C++ that were annoying me 
 Astrobytes: I sometimes use std container algorithms, sometimes even std containers (I have a custom vector class though if speed is required).I use auto and stuff, otherwise just mostly C-style
 Hjax: you need to know their size at compile time, and i kept getting compile errors when i tried to make a 2d array 
 Astrobytes: You could use vectors Hjax
 Snef: any benefit to use auto over basic type&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, just laziness/saves typing out long iterator types etc 
 Snef: hmm okey
 Snef: and i never used boost stuff
 Snef: is it usefull&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Me neither
 Snef: okey i guess i'm fine then :p
 Snef: (should i start Othello and try to beat you today hmmm)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: ill have to check the exact issue i was having later, i just remember thinking that my java was not written in a very C++ friendly way 
 jacek: he done it again :scream:
 Snef: almost 97% wr wow
 Astrobytes: holy shit, 6 points clear almost
 Hjax: jokes on you jacek, tric has like 10 versions waiting to submit, 
 Hjax: he solved the game weeks ago 
 Hjax: :P 
 Snef: Astrobytes what do you have on othello&#160;?
 struct: wtf I only saw now
 Astrobytes: a/b + ID minimax Snef
 struct: tric rating
 Snef: tomatoes are you here&#160;?
 Snef: oh ok Astro
 jacek: hes mcts
 Snef: vanilla&#160;?
 Astrobytes: tomatoes has MCTS
 Hjax: tomatoes said he has no idea how to play, so he just wrote vanilla mcts
 Astrobytes: afaik yes
 jacek: i think so
 Snef: optimized&#160;?
 Snef: his rollouts seems low
 jacek: teapot claims 80k rollouts on 2nd turn
 Astrobytes: very
 Snef: i need to learn how to optimize lol
 Snef: even with bitboard and look up i only achieved 30k on uttt
 Hjax: so when people write a search in a non garbage collected language, what happens to the nodes that fall off the tree when a move is made?
 Hjax: do you have to free them yourself
 Snef: i have a big array for nodes
 Astrobytes: Node preallocation
 Hjax: oh you reuse them 
 Snef: new is to slow
 darkhorse64: recycle. We are green
 Astrobytes: Put that first 1s to use
 Snef: and those 720MB
 Hjax: how do you decide if a node is already in your tree or safe to reuse? or how do you find a fresh node to insert into your tree
 Snef: index and you increment :p
 Snef: if your array size is big enough there is no problem
 tomatoes: i patched rollouts with some priority
 Snef: otherxise you need to reset it at some point
 Hjax: so you preallocate enough nodes for the entire game? 
 Snef: Hjax if you have low enough rollout you can
 Hjax: and if you dont? you want to reuse rollouts from previous moves right? so you dont want to throw away your existing tree 
 Astrobytes: Don't create nodes for your rollouts
 Snef: well if you use less than 10% of your node array each turn i think your safe
 Hjax:&#160;? 
 Snef: because you won't keep node that you created 10 turn before
 Astrobytes: rollout from your created nodes
 Hjax: i dont follow 
 Astrobytes: rollout from created child node, propagate result
 Astrobytes: No need to create nodes for the rollout
 Astrobytes: It's just moves
 Hjax: yes 
 struct: dont do it like me
 Snef: he was just talking about reusing tree i think astro
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 Hjax: yeah tree reuse, how do i know what nodes to keep? 
 Hjax: assuming i search too fast and run out of memory 
 Snef: if you are close to your max
 Snef: just reset the tree
 Hjax: and play a terrible move while you rebuild it?
 Snef: not terrible
 struct: That is the easier way
 struct: But there are better ways
 Snef: and you 'd only reset it one time in one game
 Hjax: i wrote a bitboard representation for uttt a while ago 
 Snef: i don't reset for uttt Hjax
 Hjax: but i couldnt work out how to structure the search in C++
 darkhorse64: first reset your tree index
 tomatoes: i had [idx&#160;% pool_size] in more earlier version of uttt
 Snef: i'd need 80k+ rollout to need reset
 Hjax: how many nodes do you allocate? 
 darkhorse64: before resetting the tree itself
 Snef: 10M
 darkhorse64: 20 M
 Snef: darkhorse64 cheater&#160;:(
 struct: 15 M
 Astrobytes: I don't do UTTT yet but in Oware I have 10M
 darkhorse64: I could do more
 jacek: 2.72M
 Hjax: interesting 
 Hjax: the tree generation stuff was the part of mcts i got stuck on the last time i tried 
 Hjax: i understand the theory, and could write a very slow version in java or python 
 Snef: it's not hard to do a fast mcts, the problem is doing a fast play() and move generator for the game i guess
 Hjax: i already have move gen + play written for uttt 
 Snef: in c++&#160;?
 Hjax: yes 
 Hjax: i just couldnt figure out the mcts part 
 Snef: i can share part of my code if you want
 Hjax: nah you dont have to do that 
 tomatoes: uttt dont need to gen all moves in rollouts
 Snef: well i don't care ^^
 Hjax: why not tomatoes?
 tomatoes: its slow
 Snef: you just to know how much you have to take one random, that's what you mean&#160;?
 Snef: +need 
 Hjax: im not sure how i would know how many legal moves there are without generating them
 tomatoes: yes, or 2 if freemove
 Snef: Hjax i keep the number and decrease it after every move
 Snef: but there is other solution
 Snef: are*
 Hjax: so you just say, theres 5 legal moves, i shall play the 2nd, make the second 0 bit in the miniboard a 1, deincrement down to 4 legal moves
 tomatoes: precompute allowed
 Snef: Hjax yes
 Snef: but i do that for the global board
 Snef: if i play in one miniboard only
 Snef: i just bount bit
 Snef: count*
 Snef: empty = ~board &amp; 512
 Hjax: popcount is magic 
 Snef: popcount(empty)
 Snef: and i use builtin ctz to get index of the bit, but i know this isn't the fastest way
 Hjax: idk maybe my next attempt at mcts will succeed 
 Hjax: i could definitely write it in python, it would just be slow as dirt 
 Hjax: java wouldnt be much faster 
 Astrobytes: Do it and convert. teccles did his in python first, then converted to C++
 Hjax: dont compare a mere mortal like me to teccles :P 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Point still stands tho'
 Astrobytes: You can do it
 Astrobytes: dbdr: sometimes it's all about the small victories :P<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/474028172">https://www.codingame.com/replay/474028172</a>
 tomatoes: wlesavo said he learned cpp for his uttt bot in 3-4 days
 dbdr: gg Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Sheer luck
 jacek: good, pull him down
 Snef: jacek mcts&#160;?
 jacek: good old a/b
 Snef: dbdr too&#160;?
 dbdr: ab
 Snef: tomatoes is the highest mcts&#160;?
 Astrobytes: afaik
 jacek: MSmits but he didnt upload it yet
 Snef: he hasn't started yet
 Astrobytes: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: He looked at it today.
 Snef: he told me he was gonna beat those nn in oware before :p
 Astrobytes: He was at one point.
 Snef: past doesn't matter..
 Astrobytes: He was above one of them before Agad e resubmitted his fixed NN last week
 Snef: i'm pretty sure he will beat them soon :p
 jacek: oh, trics using book
 Astrobytes: opening or endgame?
 jacek: opening
 Snef: 4 ply
 jacek: or at least his bot says so
 Astrobytes: Just seen it
 Astrobytes: Might be a troll :D
 jacek: 16 plies against me
 struct: lol
 struct: rip
 jacek: average 8-9 plies
 pierr.tp: hello

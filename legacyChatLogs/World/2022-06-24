 Whysaac: if a clash ends before you finish is there a way to continue playing until you can complete it?
 struct: search it here
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 struct: might need to load up
 Whysaac: ty
 eulerscheZahl: it's loaded
 eulerscheZahl: but probably offline for the rest of the month soon
 eulerscheZahl: i hit the 80% uptime per month 2 days ago already
 miobyte: struct how r u always active here?
 eulerscheZahl: the trick is not to sleep or blink
 rwilson: i bet a beer he's around but not answering just to prove he's NOT always active
 eulerscheZahl: but as a moderator he's always shown when logged in. i can assure you there are at least 100 other users who can read this chat right now but aren't shown as online (only visible to moderators)
 lifetimeLearner007: Can someone tell me what is wrong with this code? I keep getting StackOverflow error<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/KZfLnbD1">https://pastebin.com/KZfLnbD1</a>
 mlomb: what is your exit condition?
 rwilson: looks like exit condition is the maxscore ... but that MIGHT end up taking too many turns to get there..&#160;?
 mlomb: you, you could limit it to 200
 mlomb: yup*
 rwilson: well - take that back -  exiting on that isn't quite there... 
 eulerscheZahl: should be fine if he only generates valid moves. that's the exit conditino
 lifetimeLearner007: I'm running in my local. It should eventually finish right? Local doesn't have limitation of time
 mlomb: true, make sure you don-t have WAIT always there
 lifetimeLearner007: yes, WAIT isn't there always. 
 rwilson: @lifetimeLearner007 so you've got a BFS going over the move states, but trying to exit when 'phase' = null ...   you could check what you're doing with applyAction() .. but i'd personally start with measuring a few things ( like how deep it's going &amp; likely put a hard turn limit in there...  game ends after 200 game phases anyways )
 eulerscheZahl: that's DFS
 lifetimeLearner007: #rwilson, I think I'm doing DFS
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see anything wrong in the part of your bot that you shared
 eulerscheZahl: maybe in combination with a move generator that loops
 eulerscheZahl: do you put a training card to playedCards?
 eulerscheZahl: when you use the skill
 rwilson: :hand_splayed: :sweat_smile:
 lifetimeLearner007: #rwilson, the first line in applyAction() is to set phase to null. It is rewritten only if I've extra card or something
 lifetimeLearner007: I guess I've to debug through entire tree to see where I'm adding invalid actions that is causing infinite loop.
 eulerscheZahl: just print your move sequence each time you enter the function. see if it gets unreasonably long
 eulerscheZahl: or something likeif (actions.size() &gt; 20)dummy action to put a breakpoint on
 GroutchKeu: o/
 Tien118: :taco:
 rwilson: :beer:
 lifetimeLearner007: #eulerscheZahl, Thanks. Playing TRAINING card allows to play one more card and my code was playing one more card indefinitely... Hence the stack overflow
 eulerscheZahl: great. initially the game itself had the same bug
 lifetimeLearner007: Does the skill card go to draw pile or discard pile after it is used?
 eulerscheZahl: discard
 lifetimeLearner007: doesn't seem to be consistent. In one instance, after using training card, it went to draw pile. 
 lifetimeLearner007: ok, after training, I needed to play one more card but I didn't have any. So, turn ended triggering discrad pile to move to draw pile I think
 eulerscheZahl: still used =&gt; played =&gt; (after play phase) discard. when draw is empty, all discard goes to draw
 jacek: hmm, i had 3 recaptchas on submit today
 oidrissi: Guys, can someone please explain this:Turn 12 
 Magus: It's the 12th turn
 Magus: But I think we miss a part of the question
 oidrissi: My bad
 oidrissi: I understood as i was asking the question
 kataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa: hi
 zersch: ell
 zersch: o
 kataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa: davidddddddddddd
 YuyuXD: wtf
 New6969: why are questions easy can i increase difficulty?
 jacek: clashes? you cant
 friendlyPenguin: some of them won't be that easy, it depends
 putibuzu: Hi
 Sheeesh---: psyho is on top again
 Sheeesh---: the leaderboard is on fire
 eulerscheZahl: it's not that easy to just stop and switch to topcoder i guess
 Psyho: haha yes
 Psyho: especially since I feel I understand this contest and now there's a long list of small tweaks that I should try
 Psyho: and I have yet no clue about topcoder contest 
 Westicles: 3 Americans in the top 200, and 73 french
 eulerscheZahl: i had a quick look at TC but no clue either. probably another beam or simulated annealing round
 Psyho: that being said it's mostly just 10 minutes of implementing few one liners &amp; wait few hours for league system to produce stable results
 eulerscheZahl: the stage 3 problems were a better fit for me. was move about creativity and a completely unique approach than beam
 Psyho: I do think that all stage 4 problems are really good
 Psyho: and none of them were standard BS/SA
 eulerscheZahl: your local league system i suppose? you won't get anything stable here on CG
 Psyho: yeah, local league
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it's just that i'm not good at those problems we had at stage 4
 Psyho: it's my code from halite 2
 eulerscheZahl: stage 3 had a multi-agent (sheep shearing) and one about probabilites
 eulerscheZahl: somehow a lot of contestants didn't get the math to properly compute them
 Psyho: and during the springchallenge2022 stream I made it work for CG
 Psyho: oh yeah, probabilities / hidden information is sort of different type of contests
 Psyho: I do prefer full information as I can use my code optimization skills more
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, didn't watchnothing against you, i rarely watch streams for more than 5min. just a quick peak to see the local setup (operating system, IDE, ..) for curiosity
 Psyho: (plus smaller variance in general so you need fewer tests)
 Psyho: I don't blame you, I stated several times that I think watching streams has low value and I'm not a target so I have no clue what is useful for viewers
 eulerscheZahl: i just like the thinking out of the box. i never worked too hard on getting good at optim. and for those totally different tasks everyone starts at the same level
 Psyho: I believe most people just watch it in the background and sometimes tune in if there's something they find interesting
 tony_on_xbl: hi
 Psyho: "i just like the thinking out of the box." - I do feel that was the case for all of the recent problems
 eulerscheZahl: reCruse once streamed a CG contest too. somehow it derailed into hours of stuffing the game state into a few bits and serializing. he himself didn't get why it was so popular
 Psyho: none of them were typical and for all of them we ended up with a wide variety of different types of solutions
 eulerscheZahl: then i just failed to see the big picture. standard beam approach and mediocre rank
 Psyho: wait none of the used beam search
 eulerscheZahl: none of the top. i did&#160;:(
 Psyho: so... you lack on the creativity side :P
 eulerscheZahl: hard to name what was my problem with it. maybe that the task was abstract and hard to visually see what's wrong with your solution
 eulerscheZahl: the sheep shearing was completely different in that regard
 Psyho: probably sheep was more game-y
 Psyho: and experience from CG transfers to that
 Psyho: the recent ones are straight up optimization, although very untypical ones
 Nerchio: what languages do they accept at topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: probably. the sheep was very much in my favor to snipe Daiver
 eulerscheZahl: C#, Java, C++, Python
 Psyho: c++,c#,python,java
 Psyho: c++ recommended though
 Nerchio: maybe i should check out some problems 
 eulerscheZahl: some have animations. also in the statement to explain it. but only visible when you are logged in
 Psyho: I probably stated this before, but I do feel that while bot games are more fun on usual, optimization problems are much better at teaching basic stuff
 Psyho: mostly due to low variance of the results
 Psyho: but this is extremely important because low variance tells you if you're doing something better or worse
 eulerscheZahl: optim is definitely better for a fair outcome
 eulerscheZahl: here my rank is going up and down
 Psyho: and with bot contests you can waste hours on something that you have no clue if it's a general improvement or not
 Psyho: so the tempo of learning is much lower
 eulerscheZahl: i just like the gamified approach. when i entered, i never planned to get that competitive
 Psyho: oh yeah, I can relate to that
 Psyho: btw, "topcoder is all about beam search &amp; simulated annealing" - when I did my first two contests on CG (ages ago)
 Psyho: I did beam search in both
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl think we will both enter legend?
 MSmits: it's so random
 MSmits: btw, this feels like old times with the group that is near the top.
 MSmits: Illed an, you, me roya le all close together
 MSmits: it's just jace k that feels out of place tbh :P
 eulerscheZahl: beam is also helpful for some CG games, true. especially those with little opponent interaction
 eulerscheZahl: we will pass MSmits. even a good boss candidate. i don't want to be boss
 MSmits: i could be boss, my bot doesnt use that much calc time, except on rare turns
 Nerchio: i want to be the boss can we arrange that
 MSmits: but people will overfit vs boss
 MSmits: which means they overfit vs you
 Nerchio: thats fine
 Nerchio: but still only 1 bot can be a boss so unlikely no matter what
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: we still miss dbdr in the top group&#160;:(
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: and robo
 eulerscheZahl: agade, recurse and pb if you look back even further
 MSmits: pb not that far
 MSmits: he won one not too long ago
 MSmits: ocean
 eulerscheZahl: magu s usually gets strong on the last days only. still time for him
 Nerchio: didn't pb won the witches?
 MSmits: maybe both
 eulerscheZahl: yes, both
 Nerchio: i remember some insane spell combo calculations 
 Nerchio: in excel :joy:
 MSmits: i skipped that contest
 kovi: karliso also did last days appearances few times
 Neumann: Do you think they will aim for top10 at Legend opening&#160;? Or more since there is less contestants&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but no one enters as late as dapo
 Neumann: Haha, true
 Neumann: But a erfurbished phone&#160;? Meh, not worth for him
 MSmits: he enters sooner than you think. You just dont see him :P
 eulerscheZahl: their boss selection is automated now. no idea what they implemented
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'm a good boss candidate (15th atm)
 MSmits: you code like a boss
 Nerchio: the differences are so small you can jump to 10 by 2 people submitting and losing to you
 Nerchio: or get beat up like I just did by square
 MSmits: heh yeah you'll be boss, with 40 people passing you in a few hrs&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: local testing shows that i even lost to a bot printing RANDOM in 5% of the games or so
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: going home from work now. Lots of coding to do today, talk to you on sunday&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: don't forget to walk your god
 eulerscheZahl: dog
 Illedan: 200 games local test and the difference is 1 win/lose -.-
 emh: my sim is working, but not ready for submit
 lifetimeLearner007: CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION 5Isn't this a valid action?
 emh: lifetimeLearner007 only if you have two in hand
 darkhorse64: only if you have two ci
 darkhorse64: ^
 Psyho: my submission that got now #1 spot had a massive bug (~1.5 ELO diff in local league), talk about variance
 Psyho: so I now expect to be barely in top 10 after fixing it
 jacek: 1.5 ELO? oh my
 Illedan: Psyho, did you see any problems with brutaltester and using multiple threads locally?
 Psyho: hm, no idea
 Psyho: do you have something specific in mind?
 Illedan: Yeah, eulerscheZahl had huge problems
 Illedan: running random vs his 15th bot with 4 threads caused the random to win 30&#160;%
 Psyho: it doesnt crash for me, it does produce some results
 Illedan: Using only 1 thread caused him to win 95%
 Psyho: even if you use "-t 1" it's still using threads
 Illedan: Yeah, but multiple
 Psyho: because tester &amp; both solutions each use separate threads
 Mengshang: Why I get the first place but the system not notice me, which cause me can't finish the task,May I wait until the clash over?
 Psyho: I always run it with "-t 1"
 Illedan: k
 Mengshang: There someone can answer me???
 Psyho: I'd prefer to run it in a single thread (i.e. tester &amp; both players would share a single thread and everything would be executed sequentially)
 derjack: Mengshang you need to wait until the clash is over
 Mengshang: Thank. I have recved the notice of the system
 kovi: Psyho so that testing environment running many threads is stable? ("flat" timed calculations)
 Mengshang: My English not well.:joy:
 Psyho: yeah, plus it's easier to estimate the number of games my league can play concurrently 
 YurkovAS: don't forget add option "-s" for brutal-tester
 kovi: validbtw, nice prediction on scoreboardyou removed a massive bu...feature
 Psyho: I'm only using brutal tester in order to run a single game with random players on two random positions
 derjack: run multiple separate brutal testers [solved]
 Mengshang: I can create some app by Qt(C++) now, I want to learn an other lang.ask some advice
 Psyho: like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/VT55XQAi">https://pastebin.com/VT55XQAi</a>
 j4at: that doesn't handle draw correctly 
 Psyho: why? I think it does
 Psyho: brutal tester reports 0% for both players
 Psyho: so it should return [0, 0]?
 oidrissi: Psyho any stream coming soon?
 j4at: ow I thought it reports 50% for both
 j4at: my bad :p
 Psyho: oldrissi: nope, I only streamed the first day of the contest
 Psyho: no streams in the near future
 Psyho: I could try to stream CoC at some point but I'm not sure if that would be entertaining or not
 Psyho: (or educational)
 j4at: you should definitely steam coc
 oidrissi: Personally I really was looking forward to streams of Green Circle, see how you brainstorm and yeah...I wanna know how to implement a full search algorithm and you started doing so, it was interesting for me
 oidrissi: How many people in the top 100 using only heuristics in your opinion?
 derjack: :zipper_mouth:
 Nerchio:  probably plenty
 Nerchio: i have search + heuristics but I am pretty sure I could do almost the same with just heuristics
 oidrissi: In my experience Good heuristics only can get you to legend but for this game? Idk
 sua501:&#160;:) have a good day!
 derjack: maybe some state machine
 Psyho: oldrissi, hard to tell how many
 Psyho: I usually just look at&#160;% of people using python in top 100 :D
 Psyho: imho it's easier to get a decent result with sim-based solution
 Psyho: mostly because it's less frustrating
 Psyho: with heuristics &amp; high-variance game like this, you have mostly no clue about what you're doing
 Psyho: with sim-based, you know that if you implement all of the things, you'll get at least decent solution
 Psyho: if you exclude my functions for: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/49d1a41d-cc98-4496-ba7c-aabdfe2254e3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/49d1a41d-cc98-4496-ba7c-aabdfe2254e3</a>
 Psyho: huh
 Psyho: wtf hell happened :D
 derjack: pastebins dont work
 Psyho: I didn't try pasting anything 
 Psyho: test:- asdfslfdkaj
 Psyho: hm
 darkhorse64: tldr; 
 derjack: it automatically converts long lines
 Psyho: tldr;if you exclude my 3 main functions (gen possible moves, simulated single step, find move via heuristic) then sim-based approach adds like 10-15 lines of code
 derjack: you just excluded 99% things
 Psyho: 90% of my heuristic function is in my stream
 derjack: shameless advertising
 Psyho: and gen moves + simulating single step is just boring programming work
 Psyho: it doesn't even have to be super fast
 Psyho: I was still replying to oldrissi's "Personally I really was looking forward to streams of Green Circle, see how you brainstorm and yeah...I wanna know how to implement a full search algorithm and you started doing so, it was interesting for me"
 Psyho: assuming they're still here&#160;:)
 oidrissi: Simulating single steps is the step i'm stuck at
 oidrissi: Yes
 oidrissi: Thank you for the answer
 Psyho: well, it's a bit of a work (my code for that is around 150 lines) + lots of possibilities for bugs
 Psyho: but there's not much creativity here, it's just a lot of pain and you have to power through it!
 struct: gold is so small this time, its going to be hard to get to legend
 oidrissi: does simpy work on the ide?
 Uljahn: no, we have numpy, scipy and pandas though
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>
 oidrissi: Thank you!
 darkhorse64: struct: I expect we will need to win at least 5 ELO points over two days to make it
 struct: darkhorse64 5 Elo seems very hard
 struct: The gap usually isnt this big
 offroff: seems like rank 100 in silver is pretty far from gold, my if and else conditions doesn't do much&#160;:(
 struct: 8.0 point is close to 100% winrate iirc
 darkhorse64: You have two hours to play games against the top 10 and gather ideas. I already have 10 TODO lines
 eulerscheZahl: if i can suggest something to you?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/645705470">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/645705470</a>release applications
 eulerscheZahl: joking aside, your opening move looks unusual already. who needs architecture?
 struct: your first move is 3 euler?
 struct: brb
 darkhorse64: ouch&#160;! I have a bug. Architecture is for increasing my hand. I found it better than collecting TaskPrio for a start
 eulerscheZahl: my first move was 2, struct. watch closely
 darkhorse64: Not much time atm. I am expected to do my real job
 eulerscheZahl: bestest opening
 Nerchio:  its best only because you haven't tried moving to 7 euler
 eulerscheZahl: i should visit cells in descending order: 7,6,5,4
 struct: sorry euler I'm a lua dev
 struct: anyways I need to try harder now, I won't be very active in chat, ping me if it's needed, it will be open in other tab
 eulerscheZahl: wait, you got a job struct?
 struct: no, it was a joke euler because I said 3
 struct: instead of 2
 eulerscheZahl: aaah
 derjack: smits goes to 5 :thinking:
 lifetimeLearner007: Does WAIT after MOVE triggers RELEASE phase always?
 oidrissi: if possible move == release it triggers, else no
 lifetimeLearner007: in the first turn MOVE 2 -&gt; WAIT triggers RELEASE but not when MOVE 3 -&gt; WAIT
 oidrissi: It means you can't release anything
 oidrissi: on move 3
 oidrissi: or after move3
 oidrissi: but you can after move2
 lifetimeLearner007: Did I miss reading it in the problem statement? Which other MOVEs allow release?
 oidrissi: I think u misunderstood what I just said
 oidrissi: If possible_move contains something of said game phase, it will trigger the game phase
 elderlybeginner: Whan to TRAIN/CODE and when not to? (contest)
 eulerscheZahl: that sentence makes no sense
 elderlybeginner: When TRAINING/CODING in move phase has no sense?
 eulerscheZahl: of course it makes more sense in the PLAY phase when it's actually a valid move
 elderlybeginner: sure, I meant PLAY phase :wink:
 elderlybeginner: Is there a point in building the deck at the cost of slower first 4 releases?
 elderlybeginner: Is it worth to postpone release and keep some cards?
 eulerscheZahl: it's worth not drowning in debt
 eulerscheZahl: but don't ask me about the tradeoff, i suck at this game&#160;:(
 elderlybeginner: yep, I don't like it. Just going with if's and minimal effort.
 derjack: is this how you do at your job
 elderlybeginner: "That's what she said" would be better response :wink:
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: he'd need to use the jacek account for that though
 offroff: I'm looking for the minimal effort to reach gold now
 Dapps: let me know if you found it. i put in maximum effort and just squeezed in
 elderlybeginner: top silver seems to be a limit for minimal effort heuristics
 Dapps: ^ this
 Dapps: added in some limited (half-baked) sim just got me to gold
 eulerscheZahl: and gold to legend will be the limit for poor 1 turn searches i fear&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: was the boss in 30min or 1h 30min last time?
 Dapps: i have no hope. will legend be top.. 10? 15?
 Astrobytes: 30 min
 struct: top 1
 Nerchio: legend will be my rank +1
 eulerscheZahl: who knows Dapps
 Dapps: struct lol top 1 - the true legend
 eulerscheZahl: but i predict it won't get that much larger after opening
 struct: maybe 15th
 struct: since the bot is in py3
 darkhorse64: Cut predicted at 30 or top 10
 eulerscheZahl: simulation contests always have a small legend
 darkhorse64: ELO 30
 struct: well this one will be even smaller because of the amount of players  in gold
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i thought rank 10 or 30
 eulerscheZahl: wenn der Hahn kräht auf dem Mist, ändert sich das Wetter oder es bleibt wie's ist
 darkhorse64: :laughing:
 StevenV: wow, java top1
 Astrobytes: nice euler
 eulerscheZahl: you translated that?
 darkhorse64: yep
 Astrobytes: I had to use Google, couldn't understand it all
 struct: No need to translate, german is pretty similar to portuguese
 eulerscheZahl: but the rhyme got lost in translation
 Astrobytes: Yes, but the rhyme sounds great in German
 Astrobytes: to me at least
 .Anonymous.: Hello World
 struct: hi
 darkhorse64: in french: "les chiens aboient, la caravane passe"
 struct: In portuguse, "Os cães ladram, mas a carava passa".
 struct: *caravana
 darkhorse64: I recognized one word
 struct: which one?
 darkhorse64: caravana
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: rank is pretyy rng, just spam submit until legend
 darkhorse64: google translate likes "carava"
 eulerscheZahl: caravan?
 darkhorse64: yes
 Astrobytes: life goes on, regardless
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Illedan: Legend will be crowded because of the randomness
 eulerscheZahl: it will be small
 jacek: thats NOT what she said
 eulerscheZahl: it's a simulation contest. simulation legends are always small
 TINOUAINANI: When it will open?
 eulerscheZahl: reaching legend will be hard?
 eulerscheZahl: are you happy now, jacek?
 eulerscheZahl: in 15min or so
 square1001: Could you tell me the meaning of "simulation contest"?
 Astrobytes: simulate actions, search alorithm to find the best
 Astrobytes: *algorithm
 struct: for me its all games lol
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 square1001: So... One can write simulation codes for most game. What's the difference against non-simulation one?
 struct: I would say work better with heuristics
 struct: but to me that seem counter-intuitive
 struct: say some work better*
 eulerscheZahl: have a look at the previous contest (spider attack). that worked fairly well with long if-else cascades
 eulerscheZahl: this green circle game on the other hand is really hard to analyze. when i don't even know how to play as a human, how shall i tell my bot?
 Nerchio: is it that hard to play though?
 Dapps: reminds me of the other contest, the tree one. i had no idea if i was making a good move or not
 jacek: so you use simulations
 Astrobytes: I found that one quite intuitive
 Dapps: my brain couldn't comprehend it
 struct: That one was also quite simple to eval
 struct: this one?
 struct: gl
 struct: time to see who is the chosen one
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 square1001: What? Boss 1 rating 31.83?
 eulerscheZahl: boss
 square1001: The real boss...
 eulerscheZahl: where is it?
 Nerchio: #1?
 Illedan: Imba boss :D
 eulerscheZahl: seriously?
 TINOUAINANI: :joy:
 Illedan: GL HF
 Nerchio: Xd
 Illedan: :D
 struct: is this seriuous?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess their automated boss selection needs some rework
 Nerchio: so nobody is in legend atm? xD
 eulerscheZahl: ping staff on discord :D
 Illedan: Dont!
 Illedan: This will be fun
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: ok, let's deal with it&#160;:(
 Dapps: guess we were right. legend of only 1
 Nerchio: so wala is the boss then
 aCat: your notion of fun is weird Ille
 square1001: No, still 0 legends
 struct: I did say 1st
 struct: Its my fault sorry
 Dapps: banned
 Astrobytes: what happened?
 Dapps: so wala is boss
 eulerscheZahl: boss is wala
 Dapps: can win by rng
 eulerscheZahl: #1
 struct: he is the boss and doesnt even get promoted
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: that went well then
 eulerscheZahl: i expected a strong boss. but not that strong
 Dapps: very very small legend pool this time
 eulerscheZahl: wala isn't even online to see the mess he caused
 Astrobytes: boss level BOSSSSS
 struct: I just want to know if its on purpose or not
 Zylo: wala: what are the weak point of Legend Boss&#160;:-D&#160;?
 Dapps: written in java
 Nerchio: boss is already gaining points xdd
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure it's a bug
 Michael_Howard: I'm guessing this is because Legend was so crowded last time.
 eulerscheZahl: they have automated boss selection now
 jacek: and legend will revert to alpha again?
 Astrobytes: lel
 eulerscheZahl: we will never find out
 aCat: I'm pretty sure they would spend less time selecting bosses than fixing on automated selected ones ^^
 Nerchio: boss = officialContest&#160;? random(): players.get(0)
 struct: no 
 eulerscheZahl: aCat <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/974/">https://xkcd.com/974/</a>

 square1001: bowwow resubmitted! Go for the legend!
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: for (Bot &amp;b&#160;: bots)if (b.language == "Java")return b;
 Nerchio: xdd
 TINOUAINANI: struct legend or delete :grin:

 Nerchio: another game where I will be stuck in top gold I guess :D
 eulerscheZahl: looks like a need a major rewrite for legend
 struct: im already on my 8th
 struct: I write 1 bot per da
 struct: day*
 Astrobytes: continuous integration struct?
 jacek: legend or delete
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the duck or royale can promote. they haven't submitted a single time in gold and still high
 Nerchio: Thibaud "damn it. From 2k players in Gold during Spring Challenge to 200 here 😬 I've asked for help"
 struct: I'm hiding obviously
 eulerscheZahl: we can't keep this boss?
 eulerscheZahl: wala just 0.02 behind
 struct: for me its fine
 struct: its a challange
 struct: challenge*
 struct: Cant type today
 BrunoFelthes: wow, wala is the boss?
 struct: Its probably a bug BrunoFelthes
 struct: I should be the boss, something went wrong
 jacek: kree java!
 Zylo: wala is not a bug&#160;:-P
 Astrobytes: Julien just came online, guessing it'll be fixed soon
 square1001: I still believe that it is intentional
 BrunoFelthes: the boss is java
 struct: square1001 from thibaud reaction on discord it isnt
 struct: o.o
 Nerchio: codingame trying to tell us "learn to code noobs"?
 square1001: Okay, I didn't see that. Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: they do a full rerun for legend after the contest. small legend saves some costs here
 therealbeef: bad boss picking heuristic
 Astrobytes: the ultimate green legend
 BrunoFelthes: no legends, no process
 struct: hardest legend so far
 Astrobytes: lowest carbon footprint legend in CG history
 struct: if we all submit at the same time maybe we can make it
 Astrobytes: of all the bugs though, this is a pretty good one :D
 struct: This one should be a feature 
 jacek: thats 5th league, no shoddies!
 j4at: 2 days, 17 hours left It's time to start working on my Green Circle bot. I gave you start advantage bc you will not have any chance etherwise KEKW It's time to use my secret strategy (switching between first and last action)
 jacek: inclusive?
 struct: Actually you can print 2 actions in 1 turn and make 2 moves at once
 struct: you should try
 Astrobytes: switching between implies first and last exclusively jacek
 j4at: ^
 jacek: :rage:
 Astrobytes: :smiling_imp:
 BrunoFelthes: after gold, my code is too big&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: too big to fit in legend?
 j4at: that's what she said
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: You know what they should do
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: instead of rank 1
 struct: rank 2 should be the boss
 struct: That would be better
 eulerscheZahl: i vote for nerchio as boss
 eulerscheZahl: oh, he dropped. then juju rocking
 jacek: but hes above you
 Nerchio: i think your boss has less than 50% against mine euler
 eulerscheZahl: just what i believe will happen
 struct: boss should be 1% of the league size
 eulerscheZahl: it's not what i want but what i think will happen
 struct: rank 1 made sense 
 Nerchio: sendBossRequest("eulerscheZahl")
 TINOUAINANI: i vote for sheeesh--- to be the boss
 eulerscheZahl: probably ranked too low
 struct: jacek should be the boss
 eulerscheZahl: if he takes little CPU time, that even looks somewhat realistic to me
 eulerscheZahl: but i bet staff is on it already. sweating which bot to choose
 struct: I give mine
 struct: 0ms
 eulerscheZahl: definitely a fun bug
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: Truly one of the greatest I've seen on CG
 eulerscheZahl: there was this one day where every profile picture was the same. some caching error
 Astrobytes: that's quite amusing
 Hello_20: negger
 Sheeesh---: hold up
 eulerscheZahl: struct, eat him alive
 struct: well thats an easy ban
 Astrobytes: Spelling champion of the year enters the chat
 Mortis_666: will i still get the card at the desk im at if i use daily routine?
 eulerscheZahl: you can choose
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE 5 5 =&gt; gives you a card 5
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE 5 6 =&gt; gives you a 6 while going to 5
 Mortis_666: ohh
 Mortis_666: thx
 struct: python in top 5?
 therealbeef: trolling in chat during contest is like trying to rob a cop bar

 Astrobytes: therealbeef :D

 Nerchio: boss gone
 MSmits: maybe he got promoted
 MSmits: alone in legend
 Nerchio: must be sad
 Nerchio: noone to play against
 jacek: he can play himself
 Zylo: you can play with you from arena&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: Zylo are you really going full heuristics and no search?
 Zylo: heuristics to state in end of round (move + play + release)
 Zylo: and them I'll add some propabilities to heuristics of cards in next round...
 Miki09: Why is noone in legend?
 Miki09: Dis I miss smth?
 Miki09: *did
 Astrobytes: it opened with #1 gold as the boss :D
 kovi: 35
 Zylo: yes, you missed election of GOLD Boss and removing elected&#160;:-D
 kovi: i hope i can stay above
 Miki09: lol
 emh: new C++ boss
 struct: I dont see it
 Michael_Howard: It's at the bottom
 emh: it's at the bottom calculating
 emh: yeah
 Nerchio: haha
 Nerchio: did they submit the boss
 eulerscheZahl: my sources say it's jacek
 jacek: oO
 Nerchio: would be funny if boss got stuck in mid gold on randomness

 kovi: techdebter
 struct: yeah
 struct: its jacek
 jacek: so deterministic
 struct: grats jacek
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, i thought i'm bubble up. jacek is a tough choice
 struct: you have the honors of being the boss
 jacek: i should have placed a timer&#160;:(
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: jaceck good pick , WTIT very wrong pick -&gt; inconsistent monkey strat 
 eulerscheZahl: i hate you already jacek. not your fault but you will be a pain
 Astrobytes: first gold in a contest, first legend in a contest, and first gold boss in a contest: doing alright this time eh jacek :D
 emh: how do you guys know it's jacek? he's rank 5. will be tough to get to Legend still
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: :see_no_evil:
 struct: check euler replays
 struct: emh
 jacek: im more like 10, just people spamm submitting
 struct: it plays the same game
 Nerchio: i mean the boss might as well end up on like #15
 jacek: maybe thats the best optimal actions
 TINOUAINANI: "put another boss instead. The boss is currently computing. It's @jacek 's bot "
 struct: now people will optimize against jacek&#160;:(
 Miki09: Does anybody know who is silver boss?
 StevenV: do I miss sth, why we don't have legend now?
 emh: 1-1 battle against boss
 StevenV: &gt;
 Nerchio: good stop him :D
 StevenV:&#160;?
 StevenV: where is legend?
 struct: boss is computing
 Astrobytes: there was a problem StevenV, it's fixed now
 StevenV: well..
 eulerscheZahl: oh, we can even watch it this time
 j4at: anyone using NN&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: not just taking the score of the original bot
 StevenV: I still in silver, maybe the whole server just wait for me :D
 eulerscheZahl: the boss might be a NN
 darkhorse64: every chap in the leaderboard that gets passed by the boss lose hope
 emh: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: the author makes a secret out of it but is known for coding some
 eulerscheZahl: you lost your hope already darkhorse64?
 Astrobytes: and dominating with them
 darkhorse64: I had no hope. 
 eulerscheZahl: it will be a pain. i don't want to rewrite everything and have no idea how
 darkhorse64: thanks for the replay. My bot is hugely bugged as p2
 struct: euler I'm sure you will make it
 struct: Even I will get legend
 eulerscheZahl: with other strong bots submitting at the same time jacek might not climb
 eulerscheZahl: fingers crossed
 MSmits: i'm worred about jacekboss, yesterday i saw versions of his that beat me 10x in a row
 darkhorse64: euler losing hope
 IvesL: do you still have small applications from bronze onwards?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: even says so in the popup
 Nerchio: anyone from top5 wants to resubmit now? :D
 MSmits: yay i got doublewin vs jacekboss
 j4at: euler send the chat history url
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?limit=50&amp;days=7&amp;enhanced=1&amp;urlversion=2">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?limit=50&amp;days=7&amp;enhanced=1&amp;urlversion=2</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and the boss got me&#160;:(
 MSmits: noooo stop him
 TINOUAINANI: boss 29.66
 MSmits: past me&#160;:(
 Nerchio: can't wait for the boss to pass jacek too
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: youll miss wala boss
 jacek: w00t
 struct: :D
 jacek: but when I submit my code, im barely 13th :x
 Nerchio: i didnt get a single game vs boss
 MSmits: that's not necessarily a bad thing
 struct: me neither, but Im rank 70 so thats probably why
 eulerscheZahl: i got 3: loss, win, tie
 BrunoFelthes: boss win with 20 TD
 struct: jacekmax is strong
 jacek: tower defense?
 BrunoFelthes: i hate you jacek
 Astrobytes: :D
 Michael_Howard: Automaton2000 will jacekboss end up at the top again?
 Automaton2000: any way to get rid of all the pellets in the map
 darkhorse64: jacek will lose all hopes in a short while
 Astrobytes: pacman throwback
 BrunoFelthes: how can you draw the winner cards with 25 TD?
 struct: jacek reverse the game
 eulerscheZahl: 4 bonus automated
 struct: reversed*
 eulerscheZahl: 1 lucky draw and one move draw
 MSmits: struct i spent half the day converting to bitpacked... this was not easy like you said :P
 MSmits: finally got all the bugs out
 struct: Maybe you did it in a more optimized way or something
 struct: what I did was quite simple
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i had a timeout vs jacek
 MSmits: i think i did the same as you 
 MSmits: 6 bits per card type, with TD being an exception
 struct: I used 5 bits
 jacek: bitboards? :scream:
 struct: So I can store the size
 MSmits: ye but need 6 bits for bonus
 struct: 5*8+8+8+8
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: but bonus doesnt fit in 5
 struct: But then you cant store the size
 MSmits: i just count
 MSmits: dont store the size
 MSmits: takes some calc time i suppose, sometimes
 MSmits: adjusting the size every time something changes also does
 struct: yeah should be similar I guess
 struct: Performance doesnt matter much here anyways
 MSmits: true
 struct: you need to prune a lot
 MSmits: i havent pruned yet
 darkhorse64: jacek wrecked by its own creature
 struct: I only prune actions
 struct: Nothing else for now
 MSmits: you mean lossless pruning? 
 Astrobytes: sound familiar darkhorse64?&#160;;)
 MSmits: or lossy?
 darkhorse64: resistance is futile
 struct: I dont know what that is MSmits
 MSmits: lossless means you prune useless actions
 struct: I mean I dont really generate all legal actions
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: lossy means you prune actions that are probably bad, but not certain
 Crosility: Blasphemy struct. Performance always matter /s
 struct: that sounds about right
 struct: lossless
 MSmits: ah ok, then yes you need to prune
 MSmits: hashing works too though, with the bitpacked version
 MSmits: thats why i did it
 MSmits: ohhh he gettin close to me
 Astrobytes: I was about to ask you why you changed your mind and switched
 MSmits: yeah for the hashing&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: makes sense
 MSmits: hashing 60 ints is not fun
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 struct: yeah because performance wise it might be a bit worse the packed version
 struct: but to hash it should be easier
 struct: i only packed it to try beam
 darkhorse64: I predicted a cut at 30 with 10 ppl
 BrunoFelthes: starting today, it will be impossible to submit
 eulerscheZahl: we got tweeted<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/iwashi31/status/1540341683388309504">https://twitter.com/iwashi31/status/1540341683388309504</a>
 MSmits: I got likes and I don't even have social media accounts
 MSmits: like a boss!
 jacek: whats with japan and tweets?
 Nerchio: we are famous now MSmits
 Astrobytes: right jacek?
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: :head_bandage: 6 ELO to gain
 darkhorse64: MSmits as a lucky loser&#160;?
 jacek: ELO?
 Astrobytes: Electric Light Orchestra
 kovi: can be pushed easily
 MSmits: wait, why am I  a lucky loser?
 jacek: youre just loser
 MSmits: o
 darkhorse64: 1st no qualified
 jacek: phew
 MSmits: ok, so best loser
 eulerscheZahl: you will get pushed
 MSmits: no doubt
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I can troll you because there are no worries
 eulerscheZahl: i have some benchmark that looks promising so far. would be an honor for me if i can push you
 eulerscheZahl: hm, getting less promising with more games now&#160;:/
 j4at: ow 3 made it to legend
 jacek: first contest legend :tada:
 MSmits: grats
 darkhorse64: gg
 struct: grats jacek
 Sheeesh---: GG
 Nerchio: 3-1 vs boss 2-2 vs smits
 Astrobytes: grats jacek&#160;:) :tada:
 jacek: ok so far legend is not crashed
 Astrobytes: lol, progress!
 YurkovAS: :tada:
 MSmits: bowwow kicked me in the face before leaving
 struct: lol
 MSmits: 6 losses in a row
 darkhorse64: "la flêche du Parthe"
 MSmits: whats that
 eulerscheZahl: a hissing cat
 MSmits: oh right
 Astrobytes: the Parthian shot
 Astrobytes: like a big "fk you" before you leave
 darkhorse64: In ancient times, roman legions fought against Parths who had the habit the habit to throw arrows before leaving the battlefield
 darkhorse64: Parthians sorry
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: ohh that's indeed what he did
 Astrobytes: Parthians were Iranian iirc
 eulerscheZahl: Gallia in omnis divisa est in partes tres
 jacek: regina noctis pro nobis!
 Astrobytes: Galls divide omnipotently in tree parts
 eulerscheZahl: close
 MSmits: i dont think they were talking about parts of trees
 Astrobytes: three that should be
 Astrobytes: not tree
 Astrobytes: Gauls that should be too I *think*
 Astrobytes: Or Gaul
 MSmits: keep going Nerchio
 eulerscheZahl: that boss is still scary
 Scarfield: python in the lead
 MSmits: I need 0.23 more
 jacek: strainfield
 eulerscheZahl: python computing the fastest
 Astrobytes: supersnake
 Scarfield: thats what..
 Astrobytes: :D
 Nerchio: MSmits&#160;:)
 struct: Damn my old bot was bad
 jacek: old?
 aCat: this looks as the old contests..  most people goes hardcore &lt; 200 on gold and only a few in legend
 aCat: :D
 aCat: I hope I will have beter place then when I was staring then
 aCat: (probably I already have, my old contests were crappy ;p)
 Scarfield: its a card game, you have an advantage :p
 Astrobytes: not just cards, but deck building too :P
 aCat: I know - I really had half a day of switch from Tales of Tribute to this one :P
 struct: jacek im just running brutaltester vs old versions to get win rates
 Astrobytes: struct I think he was implying that your new one is bad too
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 struct: ...
 Astrobytes: this IS jacek remember
 MSmits: assisted trolling :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 kovi: assisted legend
 Astrobytes: I will miss explaining the intent of peoples statements in chat
 MSmits: :tada:
 kovi: gj illedan
 kovi: gratz msmits
 Astrobytes: nice!
 aCat: Smits gratz&#160;:-)
 nmahoude: I'm next in line, push me please&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: there is a big train coming
 MSmits: thanks
 darkhorse64: told ya: lucky loser
 MSmits: sure
 struct: just wait until my opening book is finished
 therealbeef: you're welcome MSmits&#160;;-)
 struct: Now I'm going to counter book jace k
 MSmits: good idea
 struct: But now I have extra motivation to reach legend
 struct: I have to beat jace k to get it
 jacek: thats exactly why i introduce randomness - to prevent booking
 struct: It seems deterministic though
 jacek: randomness from game cancels it out
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: he already counter booked you struct, thats why
 struct: well my bot is deterministic
 struct: It either uses 0ms or timesout
 eulerscheZahl: 0.6, push me!
 eulerscheZahl: or pull the boss, both is fine
 Scarfield: so close you and nerch
 struct: you should resubmit
 struct: :p
 Nerchio: yeah like me
 eulerscheZahl: therealbeef was brave enough to do so
 eulerscheZahl: oh, nerchio too
 Scarfield: he is real beef 
 eulerscheZahl: oooh
 eulerscheZahl: i always read there al beef
 eulerscheZahl: never made sense to me
 Nerchio: but i did small fixes that will probably change nothing
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: ok, heres the boss code, enjoy

 therealbeef: ille pushed me down (i hope)
 eulerscheZahl: won't click, i know it's broken
 Nerchio: at least it's not rickroll
 MSmits: maybe it was

 Washier: HEHE
 Sheeesh---: monke
 Washier: return to monke
 Sheeesh---: amen
 Washier: i missed this card game, seems very popular. will give it a go once i stop obsessing with the board games
 eulerscheZahl: Nerchio where are you. don't resubmit when i count on you
 Nerchio: i introduced new :bug:
 eulerscheZahl: you can do that in legend
 Nerchio: cant believe how many bugs you can make in like 5 lines of code
 MSmits: you can make so many bugs that they cancel eachother out. This is why people say their bot is worse when they fix 1
 Kanawanagasaki: on report page how to get clash name?
 Scarfield: its like a hydra, cut off one bug, 3 new ones emerge
 MSmits: you need to fix 2
 Kanawanagasaki: to train on it
 jacek: you cant go back to clash
 jacek: you can use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a> to search for it though
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: :skull: :frog: :hear_no_evil:
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: nice podium
 eulerscheZahl: i was close, then i lost some&#160;:/
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: .4 is close enough
 eulerscheZahl: was .22
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: any strat vs boss? no weakness detected so far
 Nerchio: don't worry i sent some garbage to the top
 eulerscheZahl: ooh, 0.13 only
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: he is in the stealing CI card business apparently
 eulerscheZahl: so close
 kovi: there, a win vs boss at start
 eulerscheZahl: that boss bump was you kovi? thanks
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: shreded
 struct: I have 1% win rate vs the boss, if you want I can submit to help
 Scarfield: what? first fight agains boss?
 eulerscheZahl: RANDOM was higher winrate vs me than that
 j4at: do clashes get chosen totally randomly&#160;? or by the rank of the players?
 jacek: yes
 struct: I dont think its random
 eulerscheZahl: they try to give a clash that none has played before
 Nerchio: if we have 2 debt, 5 and 8 in discard, we draw 2 what is the chance to draw automate 8?
 Nerchio: is it 1/4 + 1/3?
 Rafarafa: is the boss going to be jacek's bot untill the end of the contest? or does it update at times?
 Psyho: so you draw 2 cards out of 4 cards and you're interested in 1 of them?
 Nerchio: or 2/4 + 1/3? but that seems too much
 eulerscheZahl: 1 / binom(4,2)
 Psyho: sounds like 50%
 eulerscheZahl: 1/6
 ilgiocatore: 2/4 * 1/3
 Nerchio: but we draw 1 by 1 not 2 at once right euler?
 eulerscheZahl: does not matter
 eulerscheZahl: we draw two cards. period
 Psyho: aaah both 5+8, what euler said above is correct
 Washier: ok. this game sounds cool. must play. c ya l8er
 therealbeef: 1/6th
 therealbeef: out of 24 permutations, 4 start with 5 and 8
 Scarfield: you cant add the 2/4 and 1/3 since you can only draw that one card once
 ilgiocatore: 2/4 chance to draw 5 or 8, then 1/3 chance to draw 5 or 8. both events must happen, so you need to multiply, not add
 Scarfield: ^
 Nerchio: ok so i was counting correct except + not *
 jacek: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: *I was wrong but right
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Nerchio: :sunglasses:
 Washier: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Astrobytes: yo Washier, been a minute!
 Scarfield: xD
 Washier: howzit Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: ticking along here, how's work?
 Washier: work ticking along. nice to see the old gaurd ticking on CG
 Astrobytes: always!
 jacek: not much longer
 Washier: nooo
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, chat is gonna disappear
 Washier: oh well
 Astrobytes: discord will still be there though
 Washier: old men like me need to adapt then
 Astrobytes: haha, if I can adapt anyone can
 Quidome: I prefer this chat as well&#160;:)
 Washier: cmon Astro, we all know you are 29
 Phiti: hii
 Astrobytes: A whole decade removed!
 Astrobytes: I wish :rofl:
 Illedan: You 19?
 Astrobytes: 39!
 Illedan: ^^
 Scarfield: factorial :O
 Washier: ahem
 Illedan: 2.0397882e+46 :O
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Illedan: Give or take, just some basic head math
 Astrobytes: bunch of pedantic b**tards :D
 Scarfield: xD
 Washier: hehe
 Scarfield: you know you love it
 Astrobytes: of course :D
 Washier: read that in Scottish accent
 Astrobytes: heh heh!
 ael-bekk: do I have a chance to be prompted to the legend leagues
 ael-bekk: hhhh
 struct: depends
 struct: You might need to improve your bot 
 Washier: i would say improve your mad pod racing, good points on offer there.
 Washier: nevermind. i'm thinking rank
 struct: mad pod is outdated by now
 Washier: yeah. i'm a lurker
 jacek: hm?
 struct: Getting legend there is trivial compared to most multis now
 struct: Is what I wanted to say
 eulerscheZahl: come on, no push for me?&#160;:(
 Washier: ah cool thanks
 Nerchio: you are getting pushed euler. to the bottom
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i was just 0.13 away
 eulerscheZahl: not it's more than 1 point
 Washier: unrelated, Mr Eulerschzahl, I tried to push you in checkers for a bit. not much luck. more work needed.
 eulerscheZahl: it's fine, there is no boss i have to get pushed above
 Washier: oic
 MSmits: jacek is a Boss there too :P
 therealbeef: i8 pushed boss up .4
 jacek: try onitama
 eulerscheZahl: i think checkers is still the bot i wrote while testing the game
 Washier: I look up to Mr Jacek
 Nerchio: well done therealbeef
 PatrickMcGinnisII: USA is gonna be on fire tonight
 Washier: sheez, that hurts Mr E
 eulerscheZahl: why? did trump to something stupid again PatrickMcGinnisII?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Roe V. Wade got overturned
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 eulerscheZahl: the abortion
 Astrobytes: kind of lucky chat will disappear, jacek will be going on about this for as long as the English go on about that world cup they won in 1966
 Washier: eish
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Biden just got on camera ... trying to keep people from doing violence
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: Seriously?! :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: welcome back in the early 20th cenctury
 Washier: big smile for the world cup joke
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Groups arre already mobilizing in my state to bunr sh8t down
 Astrobytes: thanks Washier
 PatrickMcGinnisII: burn
 Washier: if this is true, holy shiz
 Washier: not cool
 eulerscheZahl: sheightt?
 Washier: shize
 Washier: kak
 Washier: excrement
 eulerscheZahl: ah, shit
 therealbeef: red state, PatrickMcGinnisII?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: short your stock.  i don't know how that affects bitcoin,eth,etc.
 eulerscheZahl: we are in europe. we can curse but not fire guns
 esjokeryt: SALAM YA HABIBI
 eulerscheZahl: as opposed to the US
 struct: even more economy damage?
 struct: I think its bad enough already
 Psyho: I'm not sure if tanking bitcoin counts as economic damage&#160;;)
 Miki09: What is the output for "THROW CARD" phase? "THROW card"?
 struct: I didnt meant bitcoin
 Astrobytes: lol Psyho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you thought BLM protests were bad ... cops in Fl. are loading their teargas right now
 Washier: no cmon
 Razovsky: eulerscheZahl come on kill this boss plz&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i can't
 eulerscheZahl: my bot sucks
 Washier: i do not believe that. nein
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess Legend opened?
 Astrobytes: gonna chat with some of my US (FL included) friends later tonight, will get the word from numerous states
 struct: Oh I seem to have a done an improvement w/e I did I cant remember
 eulerscheZahl: and the gold boss was pushed already. 1 point above the rest
 Washier: cool Astro
 Miki09: What is the output for "THROW CARD" phase?
 dot.nick: good day for america
 eulerscheZahl: "THROW 5" for instance
 Miki09: thanks
 dot.nick: please try to attack our churches, lmk how it goes for you
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is confused</b></p><p><img src="/a/3805557439373" /> Psyho: does legend work the same way as other leagues? does the trueskill have the same params?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the oligarchy wants US citizens to be divided
 struct: I think so Psyho
 Astrobytes: Yeah, divide and conquer everywhere today Patrick
 struct: The only difference is that after the contest is finished it gets 500 more battles
 Psyho: seems like everyone has 50% winrate against each other it's just 15-way tie
 struct: each player gets

 Astrobytes: well, he's achieved some kind of status I guess
 Astrobytes: legendary knob
 yal3ab: hehehehehhehe
 struct: I have no idea
 PatrickMcGinnisII: knob == git&#160;?
 Astrobytes: same as dick
 Astrobytes: Sorry, meant to capitalise that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've been to the UK, but apparently didn't get the real xperience.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: come tae Scotland
 PatrickMcGinnisII: protest sites tonight  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://map.wewontgoback.com/?source=sc">https://map.wewontgoback.com/?source=sc</a>
 Astrobytes: well, good luck to 'em all.This on top of the expanded gun rights thing on Thursday...
 Astrobytes: anyway, lets move on from political stuff for now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have an unpopular opinion.  I don't think the govt. has the right to limit me at all ... so no 'decision' is necessary to hold me up.  but half the US is gonna be under police state rule by Oct.
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is building torches</b></p><p><img src="/a/16222515698472" /> Illedan: Hi
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I understand the liberty part
 Astrobytes: Hi
 eulerscheZahl: IMO the government can and should stop you from doing some things when it affects others
 PatrickMcGinnisII: *nod*, i would think a Scot. would understand
 eulerscheZahl: freely available guns have an impact on public safety
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl why can't have a nuclear reactor in my backyard?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: because of earth quakes and tornadoes
 Astrobytes: There are enough ways to improve gun laws without infringing on constitutional rights
 PatrickMcGinnisII: btw, the guy that killed all those people in TX recently... he had over $9K worth of guns on him, no so free
 eulerscheZahl: the 2nd amendment is actually about militias for community safety, kind of like a police. was then reinterpreted
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed
 Astrobytes: and is now used to justify the kind of behaviour you saw a few months ago
 Astrobytes: Half the world is regressing
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: top 10 is goin wild
 PatrickMcGinnisII: again, I have not so popular opinions ... if the military iindustrial complex can ship weapons to god knows where ... then I should be able to own a couple.  Limit exports and I'll lconsider changing my miind
 Astrobytes: that's a valid point but dare I say short-sighted reasoning
 Astrobytes: if you can solve the issue closer to home you stand a slightly higher chance of impacting the other
 IvesL: must it be 0 to 7 before passing admin or i can anticlockwise from 7 to 0 before passing admin?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well, it's proven that criminals will still get weapons to do criminal things.  the level of deaathrate then becomes the issue.  Sure, people survive knives and such ...I'll shut up.  Did you know, death by cop and suicides are actually the biggest impact of guns?
 Razovsky: u can't anticlockwise if you are bronze or above IvesL
 IvesL: @Razovsky cuz i see some top plays go straight to 7 during first turn
 Razovsky: well i dont understand every bot :P
 Astrobytes: You've introduced 3 other topics we could talk about there Patrick :DWe're not far from the same page. Anyway, lets leave it for now
 IvesL: it reduces 1debt but if clockwise only, then he will immediately receives 2debts
 IvesL: so many questions from this move
 Razovsky: or he will give 2 bonuses away
 Razovsky: think about this
 Razovsky: less bonuses = less bonus integrated -&gt; more op&#160;?
 Illedan: On your first move, you know your second hand draw
 Illedan: You should not go to 7 if you don't draw 2 bonus on the next hand
 IvesL: @Razovsky can you throw 2 bonuses instead of skills?
 Razovsky: yeah you can
 Razovsky: that is the point
 PatrickMcGinnisII: OPPNENT_AUTOMATED isn't a thing is it?
 IvesL: right cuz the descriptions highlighted skills card
 IvesL: i will mark that down
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how does silver boss beat me with so much debt
 eulerscheZahl: one league higher i wonder the same
 IvesL: and for daily routine, do you just get 1skill card (desk+1) or you actually get 2skills card from 1 move (current desk and desk+1)?
 KingWhitfield2011: hi guys:hand_splayed:
 eulerscheZahl: always 1 card
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE x x+1 =&gt; pick up from desk x+1
 eulerscheZahl: x-1 also possible
 IvesL: then whats so good about it
 Illedan: And I'm testing random shit in Legend, and nothing seems to help
 eulerscheZahl: you can get 3 integration cards in a row
 ilgiocatore: and you can get card from occupied desk, not  giving a card to the opponent
 Nerchio: And I'm testing random shit in Gold, and nothing seems to help
 Astrobytes: x +/- n where n == number of stacked dailies
 eulerscheZahl: i'm waiting in gold and it doesn't help
 Illedan: I'll send help
 jacek: i made a boss for gold and it helped
 eulerscheZahl: illestream for the rescue?
 Illedan: ^^
 Astrobytes: lol
 IvesL: oh, so with daily routine, you can get cards backwards as well
 IvesL: noted
 jacek: and 7-0 0-7 as well
 IvesL: what does 7-0 0-7 mean?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MOVE 0 7 or MOVE 7 0
 Illedan: desk 7 and 0 are adjacent
 BrunoFelthes: daily routine can stack!
 Astrobytes: yes
 BrunoFelthes: you can get the card 3 from dest 1
 IvesL: sorry too dumb to understand, but what so special about 0-7 7-0, they still go through admin 8, isnt it?
 BrunoFelthes: no
 BrunoFelthes: yes
 jacek: are you in bronze or higher?
 Nerchio: future.location &lt; now.location goes through admin desk
 <b>**WhatTrickeryIsThis massive feed to boss</b></p><p><img src="/a/40590448621674" /> WhatTrickeryIsThis: strong bananas injections
 IvesL: @jacek just enter bronze
 jacek: you need to give cards if going through admin desk
 KingWhitfield2011: what are we talking about :confused:
 IvesL: ahh, so by "and 7-0 0-7 as well", you only mean you can get a card 7 from desk 0 as well if you have played card 2
 IvesL: i understand now, was a bit confused
 kovi: strong boss
 jacek: :blush:
 Sheeesh---: really strong
 Sheeesh---: lol
 Nerchio: strong randomness in top10*
 jacek: you shall not pass
 Sheeesh---: the gate keeper
 KingWhitfield2011: :laughing:
 MSmits: yeah only a few passed after legend opened
 eulerscheZahl: jacek having fun it seems
 Sheeesh---: and it will stay like that i guess
 Astrobytes: hence my world cup joke earlier euler
 eulerscheZahl: i was only 0.13 away. now it's 1.6&#160;:(
 KingWhitfield2011: that sucks
 Nerchio: getting close
 KingWhitfield2011: but your doing good
 Sheeesh---: imaging destroying the dreams of 184 human
 jacek: aww
 KingWhitfield2011: :neutral_face:
 Sheeesh---: feels good
 j4at: Illedan congratz :p
 Illedan: On what?
 j4at: legend
 j4at: oh did you just resubmit&#160;?
 j4at: and you were legend already&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ^
 Illedan: I resubmitted in Legend yeah
 Illedan: I tested some stupid stuff for fun, didn't work
 j4at: Feeling dumb&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: also, don't congratulate him until he's got a podium position :P
 US3RN4M3: I still dont get it, whats the meta here? time constraints allow for naive brute force simulations
 Astrobytes: no pressure Illedan :D
 Illedan: ezpz
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Illedan: I'll just fix it
 Astrobytes: naturally!
 Illedan: Brb, making chicken while thinking about what magic number to test next
 struct: maybe I need to start pretending the opponent exists 
 KingWhitfield2011: :laughing:
 Astrobytes: your bot is having existential issues?
 Nerchio: kek
 KingWhitfield2011:  
 miobyte: astrobytes and struct
 miobyte: are you guys employee of this platform?
 Astrobytes: You again. No.
 miobyte: I think u r
 miobyte: bcoz u r 24/7 active here
 jacek: impossibru
 miobyte: btw what's your occupation?
 Astrobytes: I'm currently on sick leave but I was working in pharmaceutical regulatory affairs
 miobyte: :astonished:
 KingWhitfield2011: you being weird miobyte
 miobyte: why?
 KingWhitfield2011: never mind
 miobyte:  I m sad
 KingWhitfield2011: sorry
 miobyte: no problem
 KingWhitfield2011: 😎 
 miobyte: do u know about k8s king white?
 Astrobytes: here we go again
 KingWhitfield2011: :laughing:
 miobyte: :neutral_face:
 Nerchio: if you started learning when you first asked you would be a world expert on k8s already
 miobyte: :disappointed:
 miobyte: nerchio seems really following my messages ..mate? 
 miobyte: :sunglasses:
 miobyte: nerchio, can you help me out with k8s?
 miobyte: I am stuck in one place
 miobyte: u sound like an expert
 struct: How about you stopping flooding the chat?
 Astrobytes: I think one can absorb your messages about k8s osmotically given the frequency of you posting about it
 Illedan: Can we go back to contest discussions
 miobyte: @Nerchio
 struct: next time it will be a ban
 Illedan: Everyone should stop submitting in Legend, so I can have some propper statistics on my submits
 Nerchio: anything i change now seems to be breaking my bot
 Nerchio: or the submits are random idk
 Illedan: submits are somewhat random
 Illedan: Offline training dit not work
 Astrobytes: offline training == asking the chicken for new magic numbers? :D
 Illedan: Yeah, I found a new number on the serial number of the package
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 kovi: in game picture i see live training, no wonder you fail with offline
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 struct: how am I going to win 4.5 points...
 eulerscheZahl: you don't, that's the problem
 eulerscheZahl: delete your account. i might follow you on that journey
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I will get legend
 Illedan: Can I have all your C# codes then?
 eulerscheZahl: sure thing
 eulerscheZahl: great sale
 struct: I have no C# bots orry
 struct: sorry*
 Astrobytes: just make your cg repos public
 Astrobytes: [solved]
 ilgiocatore: gold boss really loves continuous integration and tech debt
 Illedan: Then I would never get a job offer again
 Astrobytes: :D
 KingWhitfield2011: hi struct
 KingWhitfield2011: sup guys
 jacek: tech debt on jenkins?
 KingWhitfield2011:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i8fb promoted
 kovi: gratz
 kovi: barely...but doing it solo
 jacek: solo?
 Astrobytes: wasn't pushed
 Sheeesh---: congrats i8fbnkyw
 StevenV: oh my silver&#160;:
 Sheeesh---: it's like watching the stock market
 Astrobytes: Far more interesting imo
 Astrobytes: Paint drying is also far more interesting than watching stock markets.
 Astrobytes: *Watching paint drying
 Sheeesh---: i'm talking about the arena tho not the game
 eulerscheZahl: Sheeesh--- is this a bug at 61?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/645968631">https://www.codingame.com/replay/645968631</a>
 Astrobytes: I'm also talking of the arena&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you release an application for 4 debt. you could take another one with only 2
 jacek: and yet he won
 Sheeesh---: oh
 Sheeesh---: that means i can still improve my bot
 Sheeesh---: it's not a bug
 Illedan: ValGrowth?!
 Sheeesh---: it's just my bad code
 Astrobytes: Almost top 5 JP only :D
 Astrobytes: wala saving the day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl looks like it's doing a prevent on you releasing 15 because u have 1 automated CI
 Astrobytes: ValGrowth almost getting a solid lead
 Astrobytes: Psyho holding out well
 Huctor: hwo to change english version&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Get the 2022 edition of the dictionary?
 eulerscheZahl: no PatrickMcGinnisII. even for blocking me there is a better option
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well u have 2CI in inventory and enough bonus to cover...*shrug*
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to block me, take app 27
 Astrobytes: 6/8 top legend are JP, the 2 others are PL :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u don't have inventory tho
 Astrobytes: JP invasion&#160;:)
 ValGrowth: The massive improvements I worked on over three days finally paid off&#160;:)
 Rafarafa: so this gold boss is going to be the same until the end of the challenge or does he update?
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 Astrobytes: looking good ValGrowth!
 eulerscheZahl: the boss will stay as is
 Rafarafa: damn, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: evil boss, i know
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: oh come on jacek, you're loving it :D
 eulerscheZahl: i don't blame you jacek, you didn't pitch it as the boss
 eulerscheZahl: i blame illedan who was asked if jacek is ok
 Illedan:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Rafarafa:&#160;:(
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: let's see if this submit gets me anywhere. trying the opening book steal once again
 eulerscheZahl: close to the 100k limit thanks to it
 MSmits: wow
 eulerscheZahl: i'm bowwow now
 MSmits: it's unlike you to write so much code
 jacek: why bowwow
 Illedan: opening book steal?
 Astrobytes: must be some opening book!
 eulerscheZahl: i downloaded his last games and imported all moves that don't result in releasing the first app
 Astrobytes: game-length opening book :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: if i find this exact state in my game, i'll do what he does
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and the submit is not looking good
 Psyho: oh yeah, I want to steal opening moves as well
 Nerchio: xd
 Psyho: my early game sucks
 Astrobytes: desperation has truly kicked in euler
 eulerscheZahl: then i won't try to steal you
 Illedan: yeah
 kovi: its not trivial
 kovi: if it doesnt match the behaviour of later eval/heuristics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I'm blocking opp releases and still losing
 Psyho: my opening as a 2nd player was to do MOVE 7 when opponent did MOVE 5 :D
 eulerscheZahl: smart
 Psyho: + 0.5 locally after fixing it at MOVE 2 :D
 Illedan: WTF
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: prevents timeouts
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: This should be far better
 Illedan: Else I'll be very sad
 Sheeesh---: lost against the boss 4 times in a row
 Astrobytes: if (!first) delete;
 Sheeesh---: sorry guys cD
 Sheeesh---: lol
 eulerscheZahl: ban
 eulerscheZahl: did you correct the choice of app to release?
 Sheeesh---: yeah
 Sheeesh---: didn't change that much
 Nikanameu: is this multiplayer after contest?
 Sheeesh---: but thanks!!
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes Nikanameu
 eulerscheZahl: because astro announced it
 Astrobytes: I said so thus so mote it be
 Astrobytes: (it was on discord)
 eulerscheZahl: my bowow immitation is pretty lame. maybe only the first 2 or 3 turns then?
 Illedan: But ValGrowth is far better?
 Illedan: Which reminds me, I should go watch his replays
 Astrobytes: euler doesn't care now, just yolo legend
 Nerchio: instead of adding stuff I try to remove stuff now
 Illedan: Scoring based on player score is my latest thing :D
 Astrobytes: ...what was it before?
 kovi: renesance of refactor / removing techdebt strat Nerchio?
 MSmits: I know the feeling euler. I've been in contests before where I stayed just below the legend cut for the entire weekend, only beating gold midnight after sunday.  Hope it goes better for you
 Nerchio: I try to remove everything and see what works kovi :D more techdebt didnt work for me so far
 jacek: you put techdebt in your code instead
 Neumann: Are you allowed to play TRAINING if you have only 1 card available in DRAW/DISCARD&#160;? And if so, what happens&#160;?
 Neumann: Same for CODING if DRAW/DISCARD is empty
 eulerscheZahl: you can and you will get only 1 card
 eulerscheZahl: coding will give you 1 extra action and no card
 Neumann: Ok thanks
 darkhorse64: sure&#160;? it does empty discard
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 darkhorse64: it does not empty discard&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: the question was: if there are no cards
 struct: he did say 1 card right?
 Astrobytes: "Same for CODING if DRAW/DISCARD is empty"
 eulerscheZahl: 1 card for training0 for coding
 struct: ah
 struct: ok
 darkhorse64: sorry, I misread. You are right
 struct: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm incapable of stealing an opening via script. it just plays worse than without
 Astrobytes: rest your brain a little, you'll come up with something better
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just submit that thing that has a remote hope of getting pushed
 eulerscheZahl: then go to bed
 eulerscheZahl: and cry myself into sleep
 eulerscheZahl: (the last wasn't serious)
 Illedan: :hug:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my last change brought me up to Astrobytes, but still no topp silver or gold
 Astrobytes: you'll get legend
 Astrobytes: my best is 5 to 8th Patrick
 eulerscheZahl: nice submit Illedan. is that with multiple plays?
 Astrobytes: I'm refactoring so I can read my code better and tweaking
 Illedan: Yeah
 Astrobytes: nice. Significant difference :D
 Illedan: Who would have thought
 Illedan: -.-
 Astrobytes: hehe, nevermind, you found it&#160;:)
 Quidome: Did I get that correctly, discard is only shuffled back in during start of turn with the draw (if needed)?\
 StevenV: so I reached the limit to test my bot&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: if draw is called discard is shuggled into draw pile if draw pile is empty
 Astrobytes: *shuffled
 Quidome: aha I see, draw is called 4 times i suppose&#160;:)\
 Quidome: I you play an card in an action can you use that same card with release?
 Illedan: Next challenge, wall of Japanese :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder also has a lot of jp
 Astrobytes: the JP guys have been going hardcore the last few CG contests&#160;:)
 Psyho: atcoder is partially responsible for that
 Astrobytes: that makes sense, good point
 Psyho: half of people in marathons are japanese
 Illedan: Ah, I can do my above Psyho tweet again now :D
 Psyho: :D
 Astrobytes: nice to see more 'cross-pollination' for want of a better term between platforms recently
 Quidome: what does skill automation mean in the game?
 struct: automated cards can be used to release apps
 struct: its like a passive skill
 Quidome: Sounds powerfull
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl opening book? :D
 Nerchio: :rage:
 Astrobytes: what's the boss at points-wise?
 Nerchio: 31.10
 Astrobytes: oof
 eulerscheZahl: i disabled the book again
 struct: one more night of suffering for me
 struct: :p
 Nerchio: euler can you beat down the boss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/646003474">https://www.codingame.com/replay/646003474</a>
 Rafarafa: is it possible to check how many of my loses are from starting second?
 Astrobytes: you love it struct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 120 frame tie game
 jacek: its not tie
 eulerscheZahl: yes Rafarafa. just open all replays and count
 struct: not really, I just want to get legend and be done with it, its probably harder than the spider challenge
 Astrobytes: you won that Patrick
 struct: Since I cant cheese with triple wind
 EDA1010: :joy: hello guys
 EDA1010: any advice on how to prepare for Amazon assessment 
 EDA1010: I've one Can someone help this poor guy get a job
 Astrobytes: good knife skills and rainforest experience
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 10 debt is usually my endgame if I don't lose ... but way too many frames
 Nerchio: euler can you go back to opening books
 EDA1010: :joy: Not that Amazon 
 Astrobytes: just joking EDA1010&#160;;)
 EDA1010: I know bro no hard feelings :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: why Nerchio?
 Nerchio: you beat me and I was good&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: my opening book didn't even make it to top20
 StevenV: around 4x in silver, gold is too far for me&#160;:*
 Astrobytes: EDA1010: I don't have any Amazon-specific advice but be confident, stay calm and focus
 jacek: and play the amazons
 struct: solve it
 EDA1010: thank you guys , where I can find it if you may  and sorry I'm somewhat new here , thank you in advance  :grinning:
 Astrobytes: struct and jacek you can both undo your handiwork and help this guy
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:

 EDA1010: thank you guys I wish you a good weekend 
 jacek: umm
 struct: Yeah it should take about a weekend
 EDA1010: thx again if I did su
 EDA1010: succed I'll let you know 
 jacek: youd better practice on easy puzzles first
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Astrobytes: is your assessment on here EDA1010?
 EDA1010: I'm doing so right now 
 EDA1010: No they prefer Hackerrank 
 jacek: if amazon uses codingame platform for recruitment, the puzzle will be similar. input/output etc
 Astrobytes: I see, I'd advise completing medium-difficulty puzzles at least  either here or hackerrank
 Sheeesh---: "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time." for more than 1 hours now
 EDA1010: thank you I will do my best at the end if things didn't go well at least I know I did my best 
 Astrobytes: You will know what to focus on after that EDA1010, interviews/assessments are great learning experiences too
 Astrobytes: and good luck!
 Astrobytes: mods these days :rolling_eyes: :P
 struct: Just had an idea, I have something to work on tonight
 struct: rank 1 incoming
 struct: Maybe I cant win a phone since I'm a mod
 Astrobytes: teaming up with Dapo?
 struct: They don't want me slacking
 struct: Obviously, I explained him the rules to save his time
 struct: That's about all I did
 Astrobytes: :D
 StevenV: silver 12, gold, I am coming
 jacek: :tada:
 Astrobytes: don't bet on it StevenV lol
 Nerchio: :rocket:
 jacek: :head_bandage:
 Astrobytes: bone Heide&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: *bon
 Nerchio: commenting out random lines of code in hopes it will work better - this is what peak coding looks like whether you like it or not
 Astrobytes: I've been doing that all day
 MSmits: yeah i hate this part
 struct: I hate this since day -1
 emh: my heuristics bot is still way better than my sim bot
 emh: I gotta make a hybrid but it's a lot to port from Java to C++

 MSmits: push them all out PatrickMcGinnisII
 Illedan: How is the bot MSmits? Any ideas for top 5?
 MSmits: yeah i am working on something, but no luck so far. 
 Astrobytes: not giving advice to others I would guess :D
 Illedan: SmitsiDrawCardsMax?
 MSmits: I am not saying, just in case it works :P
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Good
 struct: sorry Nerchi o
 Illedan: At least keep quite when I'm off chat
 Illedan: ^^
 Astrobytes: hence my statement :P
 MSmits: I did help out some people today, but only repeating the things i already shared on world chat
 struct: people pm for advice?
 Astrobytes: that doesn't count
 MSmits: yea
 struct: They only pm me to ask why they got kicked or banned
 Astrobytes: no amusing money offers?
 MSmits: no
 Astrobytes: shame, they make great screenshots
 MSmits: yea would be funny
 Astrobytes: anyway, get coding
 MSmits: mostly debugging now, figuring out why my bot is total crap with the new thing&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's a lot of new, so... might be bug, or it just doesn't work
 Illedan: Let me know if you need help
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: I only accept shitcoins
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: jobbycoin
 struct: I hate brutaltester
 struct: WWWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: hate the bot not the tester
 struct: at least my bot uses 0ms so its fast to test
 Astrobytes: crashbot excels at time saving
 Palmipedus: VilBoub je suis passe devant toi
 Palmipedus: sorry wrong chat
 Palmipedus: that's world :D
 Astrobytes: c'est cool Palmipedus :D
 Michael_Howard: HEyou have a British 
 Michael_Howard: flag. Is that so you can get the country prize :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Palmipedus: haha, not really, I'm french but leave in the uk since 2014
 Astrobytes: moi aussi Michael_Howard, doesn't mean we can't inulge
 Astrobytes: *indulge
 Astrobytes: Palmipedus: that brexit wasn't a problem?
 Michael_Howard: Right. I'm doing the next challenge from Liechtenstein
 Palmipedus: for the country definitely, for me personnaly no as I have the right to stay infinitly and if shit hit the fam more than now, I can still go back to France :D
 Astrobytes: I envy you Palmipedus, I'm Scottish
 Palmipedus: tbh, the only reason we stay at the moment is for the kids to learn english, for them to be really bilingual
 Astrobytes: move to Bretagne, lots of expat-Brits there to teach :D
 Palmipedus: Astrobytes god poor you, I always feel that the "union" is just a name
 Astrobytes: It is Palmipedus. In my lifetime I wish to see Scottish and Irish freedom from the 'union'
 Palmipedus: yeah but learn the culture and speak the english at school is what make you really bilingual (by expereeince)
 Palmipedus: honeslty I think there is a way, it may be 'easier' for irish as thay have the GFA and just need a refenrendum
 Palmipedus: Astrobytes for Scotland, even if you guys get a referendum and win, they will lie and do everything they can to keep you in
 Astrobytes: true regarding 'cultural immersion' wrt language, wise move.If there was Irish unity and no SCots independence there would be a lot of trouble. The two are interconnected in a way that is kinda hard to see unless you're one or the other. And yes, you are correct there. Though this current English government are willing to tear up any agreements they feel like 
 Psyho: whoever is resubmitting in legend, pls keep doing it - it's clearly good for my ranking 
 Palmipedus: it's just my opinion but I think the Irish will be first thanks to Brexit and Scotland might follow depending how the Westmister plays it
 Illedan: Np Psyho
 Palmipedus: Psyho anyway there is a rerun in Legend at the end of the contest, so ranking in that league means not much
 Illedan: But it's fun to be first!
 Psyho: it's good for screenshots and tweets!
 Illedan: ^
 Psyho: the rerun is from scratch or from current position?
 Illedan: Need to counter the tweet of ValGrowth
 Illedan: Current position, but with Tan (or what that parameter in TrueSkill is called) reset
 Astrobytes: Palmipedus: It's certainly possible yes. And don't forget the Welsh (and the Cornish, somewhat :P Breton separatists!) but Wastemonster (as we call Westminster) will never allow any of this without a long protracted fight, legal or not
 Psyho: "I'm doing a major remodeling now, and the one I have now has 1700 lines, and the one I have is 3700 lines."
 Psyho: 3700 O_O
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: tau Illedan?
 Illedan: I guess that is it
 Psyho: yep, tau
 Psyho: wait, you mean sigma?
 Astrobytes: there's also mu
 Astrobytes: so lets try to guess what Illedan meant 
 Illedan: Going into the forums, never really cared about that detail
 Psyho: you don't reset tau, tau is that parameter that artificially bumps up sigma so that rankings dont stabilize
 struct: rank 59, soon enough ill make
 struct: But today I need to rest
 Astrobytes: mu just introduces farm animals or cats depending on your pronunciation so don't worry about that param
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/propositions-to-replace-bo5-final-contest-rerun/2851/8">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/propositions-to-replace-bo5-final-contest-rerun/2851/8</a>
 Illedan: Maybe
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: There has to be a post from pb4 about this case
 Astrobytes: what about br?
 Illedan: He made his own calculations
 Illedan: or are you talking about battle royale?
 Astrobytes: something in that thread about the differences though?
 Astrobytes: no bitrunner
 Astrobytes: might be something in another contest thread, just clutching at pb4 straws
 Psyho: I read the thread but it doesn't say what CG is using, right?
 Illedan: No, I think you have to find the specific Contest thread, where this issue was discussed and the rerun details were created :P
 Psyho: I'd imagine it was right after the contest where I really pissed off
 Psyho: and refused to take the prize for the 3rd
 Illedan: Which one?
 Psyho: *where I was
 Psyho: the arcade puzzle thing
 struct: STC
 Psyho: drop puzzle with combos
 Astrobytes: STC yeah
 struct: But what happened?
 struct: ah the recalc
 struct: It barely changes the rankings tbh
 struct: Its like they give less point per match or something, idk how it works
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/smash-the-code-question-about-the-final-ranking/1515">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/smash-the-code-question-about-the-final-ranking/1515</a>
 Psyho: there was also one more problem that not related to rankings that was kind of nasty
 Psyho: the VMs that were used were changed
 struct: what could go wrong /s
 Psyho: and eldidou used rdtsc for timing
 Astrobytes: :P
 Psyho: the new VMs had different clock speed and suddenly he timed out like 30% of the matches or so
 Illedan: lol, that sucks
 Psyho: (that happened right before the end of the contest and he didnt notice)
 Astrobytes: madness
 struct: last contest there was a clear cut winner it was SC21
 Psyho: oh, but STC had big differences
 struct: let me see
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/smash-the-code/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/smash-the-code/leaderboard/global</a>
 struct: oh yeah
 Astrobytes: nice to see you back at least Psyho&#160;;)
 Psyho: for example I had like ~65% WR over eldidou (I remember I run a ton of games)
 Psyho: the thing was that with the default tau and no other workarounds, essentially the last 50 games define the ranking
 Astrobytes: brutal
 Psyho: default tau is 0.083333 (and I believe that was the value used atm, for comparison I use 0.00025 locally)
 struct: larger values impacts the elo more?
 Psyho: larger values never stabilize the ranking
 Psyho: i.e. no matter how many games you run, it never stabilizes
 struct: ah I think I understand
 Psyho: (you need tau&gt;0 when new bots are introduced, but you can set tau=0 when you stop adding new bots)
 Astrobytes: hence the earlier comment re Tau
 Astrobytes: ie. tau should tend to 0 as the recalc progresses
 Astrobytes: *calc not recalc
 Astrobytes: great that all this is discussable openly when CG is in its twilight years&#160;:(
 jakeHaln: Hello guys 
 Astrobytes: CG community I mean, not CG, it's fine
 Psyho: oh, you CG community is dying?
 Psyho: doesnt contest have a ton of participants?
 Astrobytes: For a while now yeah.
 Astrobytes: Yeah but there's always been a strong core base, even that's diminishing
 Psyho: wasnt Spring Challenge 2022 the largest contest so far?
 Astrobytes: The reduced contest count per year, no more community-made  contests
 Psyho: ah ok
 Psyho: the larger it gets, to more it costs&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: It was yeah, re 2022 Spring
 Psyho: *the more
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but there's some hope I guess. This contest is made by longtime members who work for SG, and got SG to sponsor it
 Astrobytes: So that might be some kind of beacon of light
 Astrobytes: The board game community won't die, people make games a lot for just community. The lack of chat -&gt; moving to discord will kill a bit of that I fear
 Psyho: I like discord
 Psyho: isn't it just the problem with mentality
 Psyho: i.e. that's fine to shit talk here, but somehow not on discord
 aCat: because this chat is always near
 Astrobytes: I  don't mind it either, the chat here is quite immediate and nice, I can do other things on my other monitor, but I understand people who don't wanna switch
 aCat: and you watch CG IDE or replays at the same time
 aCat: Discord is yet another app
 Astrobytes: yeah that's it aCat
 struct: Can always try to ask them to not remove it
 Illedan: Yeah, Discord will kill the chatting&#160;:(
 struct: :p
 aCat: I use it all the time but that's switching context too much for CG
 Illedan: We need low key shit-chat to keep the contest spirit up
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 Psyho: but discrod works well on mobile
 Astrobytes: I'm always on discord but I can't leave a channel open just for CG all the time
 struct: It would be nice to at least have this chat during contests
 Psyho: so you can keep up with your shit talking while going out for a walk
 Astrobytes: I don't use internet things on my phone&#160;;)
 struct: I need win this phone to join discord
 struct: Not looking good atm
 Astrobytes: :D
 aCat: Illedan how many sims you have?
 aCat: You have sims till endgame?
 struct: yesterday he had100
 Astrobytes: 1 sim, probably a lot of playouts though :P
 Psyho: so probably 50 now
 aCat: Im asking about today
 aCat: I have like 500&#160;:(
 struct: 500 until end?
 YurkovAS: 1sim = 1 move?
 Illedan: 700
 aCat: y
 BrunoFelthes: Monte Carlo sim?
 Psyho: I think I have 2k (at the start)
 YurkovAS: i'm have 50-60k sims
 Astrobytes: 1 sim for me == working sim
 Illedan: My type of sim&#160;:)
 Psyho: *buy my
 struct: YurkovAS MCTS?
 Illedan: 50-60k?!
 Psyho: I swear this chat has autocorrect
 aCat: 50-60k!?
 Illedan: What is a sim?
 Astrobytes: lol Psyho
 YurkovAS: 50-60k sims1sim = 1 move
 Illedan: and 1 sim = 1 play card?
 struct: oh I have 200k with beam
 aCat: root of the game until end of the game
 Illedan: 1 move + give + throw + play + release = 5?
 struct: 1 move = 1 action
 Psyho: oh, but with rollouts/monte carlo, you need heuristic
 Illedan: I have 10-20k of those
 YurkovAS: yes = 5
 Psyho: so the bottleneck is not the sim, but the logic for moves
 Illedan: Then ok
 BrunoFelthes: i have 4k sims until the end, and my results are pure garbage
 Illedan: I have 700 rollouts 
 aCat: you give mo hepe Ille
 struct: Do you sim opponent Illedan? no need to answer
 aCat: I don't have to be so fast as those crazy cpps ^^'
 Illedan: sure
 Illedan: Some of the time
 Illedan: The rest I put him in a corner to cry
 Psyho: in rollouts you have to, otherwise it defeats the purpose
 struct: Tomorrow Im going to try mcts with opponent, it might be a waste of time but w/e
 Astrobytes: did you try SP?
 struct: no
 struct: I tried beam, chokudai, synced beam
 struct: all failed
 struct: Maybe I had a bug
 Psyho: can we bet on whether its going to turn to be a waste of time?
 struct: sure
 Astrobytes: someone make one of those poll things
 Psyho: lemme quickly mint some psyhocoins 
 struct: It wont be a lot of time since I can reuse it from other multis
 Astrobytes: psyhocoins :D
 Astrobytes: when was synced beam a thing btw struct? on cg
 struct: spring challenge 21
 aCat: trees
 Astrobytes: I missed the synced part
 Astrobytes: :D
 Psyho: made the poll: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://take.quiz-maker.com/poll4392423xB00D497f-138">https://take.quiz-maker.com/poll4392423xB00D497f-138</a>
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct: I voted
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 Psyho: never heard of synced beam
 Psyho: (but I'm terrible with knowing names for algorithms)
 DomiKo: that isn't really the name
 MSmits: isn't that a ghostbuster thing
 Psyho: and I believe "chokudai" search is known as beam stack search?
 struct: yeah probably coined by CG
 MSmits: synced beams?
 Illedan: gn
 Astrobytes: gn Ille
 MSmits: gn
 Astrobytes: yes Psyho, re Chokudai
 Psyho: gn
 struct: gn
 Psyho: I find it weird to have an algorithm named after you just because you have a lot of followers on twitter
 struct: Since the game had days and you could output multiple actions per turn you added the finished states for that day to a diferent stack
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: what's the proper name?
 struct: but kept adding the unfinished to the next states
 DomiKo: "multiple actions" you mean different number of actions
 Astrobytes: Psyho: MSmits has one named after him because he named it so :D
 DomiKo: Astrobytes I don't think there is a name for it
 struct: Let me search in the forum
 Psyho: vanity!
 struct: maybe someone explains it ebetter
 MSmits: indeed
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: what was agreed on in the end via Dapo?
 Psyho: heh, I did popularized few weird algorithms on topcoder, but never thought about naming them
 Astrobytes: UCT Forest, thatos the one
 Psyho: like, the simulated annealing most people use on TC
 MSmits: ye
 Psyho: is not simulated annealing
 MSmits: what do they use?
 Astrobytes: another hc variant presumably
 struct: I guess euler explains it better
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/2">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/2</a>
 Psyho: SA is defined by using double() &lt; exp(result_delta / temp)
 struct: Its quite simple to understand it if you already know beam
 Psyho: as acceptance 
 Astrobytes: that's how I do SA
 Astrobytes: maybe that's why mines never works right on TC
 Astrobytes: :P
 Psyho: it's good in general case, but not when hyperoptimizing for 10s execution time
 Astrobytes: yeah admittedly it's best used as a partial search
 Psyho: new_score &gt; old_score + rng() * tempis usually better
 emh: both my bots are 85k.. if I merge them I guess I might have a problem
 emh: though there should be a good amount of reuse
 struct: 85k chars?
 emh: ls -alh
 Astrobytes: the weird things I have done to that calculation...
 emh: so yes
 BrunoFelthes: what is best at the start of the game 2 bonus or 1 less td?
 Astrobytes: yes
 Psyho: 2 bonus in general
 Psyho: but it's really tricky
 Psyho: the "perfect play" is to get a lot of cards, so that you build all of your last 3-4 apps in a single shuffle
 Psyho: so that your debt cards wont ever get shuffled into draw pile
 struct: interesting
 Psyho: 2 bonus drastically helps with that because it makes your deck larger
 Psyho: and so, it gives you more time/turns to achieve that
 BrunoFelthes: hummm
 struct: its time to rest for me, gn everyone
 emh: gn struct
 Astrobytes: gn 
 MSmits: gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BrunoFelthes imo what is best is an ARCH study or a CONT int. depending on what is in your hand, if your opponent is sitting on/near it, etc.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 40 in silver, I'm done...don't want to eval sims
 struct: cant sleep oh well
 Lysk: might as well code then&#160;;)
 struct: A bit tired, but I will
 Lysk: what would be a good timer to use in python? 
 oidrissi: If someone is interested in showing me their implementation of a simulation :joy: :joy: I would be very grateful
 struct: That sounds like a great idea
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a1d3e4e7-0c0a-400f-b0b7-cadf2cb87a06">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a1d3e4e7-0c0a-400f-b0b7-cadf2cb87a06</a>
 oidrissi: Didn't get to see that, expired
 eulerscheZahl: no promotion popup on login. sad
 struct: euler keep your hopes up
 struct: I'm sure you will manage to get legend
 eulerscheZahl: of course. that's the law
 struct: Even I still have hope to get legend
 eulerscheZahl: or delete
 struct: why not
 eulerscheZahl: oh, your profile even says top50 or delete
 eulerscheZahl: top50 might even be easier than legend
 Dapps: made many improvements since getting up to gold
 Dapps: they've all added up to me 2nd last in gold
 struct: hard to see what improvements are here
 struct: at least for me
 BrunoFelthes: i'm justing running out of ideas... my last improvement was a giant open book
 BrunoFelthes: that made my code too large
 struct: yeap im also running out but I have to make a mcts to know the bet result
 BrunoFelthes: more than 1 turn? or just 1?
 struct: more
 struct: but no rollout
 BrunoFelthes: i think that it is too late to start another simulator
 struct: probably yeah
 struct: There is something we are missing
 struct: I just don't know what
 BrunoFelthes: I know... my simulator is just a garbage
 struct: Im sure its doable to write a sim from scratch
 struct: You know the full rules now
 struct: It was hard at the start because we had no idea what the rules were
 BrunoFelthes: I should do something like the algo used at fall challenge 2020... 
 BrunoFelthes: the one that we built potions
 struct: what did you use?
 struct: beam search?
 BrunoFelthes: yeah...
 BrunoFelthes: stacked beam search
 BrunoFelthes: open book, with a stacked beam search 
 BrunoFelthes: this game has a clear distinct 3 phases... built bonus, built 4 points with low TD, end the game with luck...
 Westicles: didn't pysho stream his approach?  just do that
 Westicles: or is it 8 hours of mumbling and typing sounds?

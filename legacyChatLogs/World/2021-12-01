 ogvenocity: yo
 ogvenocity: who wants to vs
 MynameisDuy: me
 Aaronnotsharon: anyone know the league that gives you veloxity as a new input in Mad Pod Racing?
 Wontonimo: you can calculate it
 Wontonimo: just store your previous location
 Wontonimo: velocity = current location - previous location
 Aaronnotsharon: ohhh.. ok thanks. I saw some people talking about it and thought it would be a new input thanks.
 UZUHAMA: How do you know the angle to opponent's pod in Mad Pod Racing?
 Wontonimo: trig
 Wontonimo: gotta calculate it
 UZUHAMA: I saw the boss ramming straight to my pod
 Wontonimo: oh, you don't need the angle
 Wontonimo: you can just aim for the enemies x,y
 UZUHAMA: Oof yeah
 UZUHAMA: Why didn't I think of that
 UZUHAMA: Wait
 UZUHAMA: I do need the angle
 UZUHAMA: Do I really have to use trigonometry...
 Wontonimo: why do you need the angle?
 Wontonimo: just aim straight at the opponent
 UZUHAMA: I'm trying to stop if opponent is right behind me
 Wontonimo: oh interesting
 UZUHAMA: so if angle to opponent = 180 then stop or something like that
 ROOTREDOX: :thumbsup:
 Ghouljokes: wouldn't you need to also work the angle to the next point in? Because I don't think there's a stat for which direction you're currently facing, or if there is I sure haven't seen it.
 derjack: huh
 elderlybeginner: there are some name changes of puzzles and bot/optimatization. When did it happen?
 ZXC01: they could happen any time i think
 ZXC01: as log as the maker of the puzzle wants 
 5DN1L: As long as the codingame staff sees fit
 5DN1L: they're trying to avoid copyright infringement issues
 5DN1L: so they're in the process of renaming the puzzles recently
 TheToeConnoisseur: how do i porgoram my mother to be better at motherhood
 5DN1L: ZXC01 Have you solved your puzzle issue you raised yesterday?
 Uljahn: CG's been acquired by CoderPad, that's the root cause of recent changes
 COOLRAPTOR08: hi
 [CG]Thibaud: community puzzles and games shouldn't be impacted (at least for now)
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Does anyone know how to make good solutions to problems like Search Race with Python without using NN?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Genetic algorithms are common with other languages but python seems too slow for them
 derjack: you can hardcode the solutions and print in python
 derjack: [solved]
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: True
 Alshock: Python is slow by definition, you can either get around the issue by using C libraries or ty to be clever to avoid machine iterating
 Alshock: both seem boring to me
 n0b1e: I have held off learning c , is it worth it
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Alshock Is there an option that doesn't seem boring?
 Alshock: to make a good Python AI?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yeah
 Alshock: well python is slow. So it's always gonna get on your nerves at some point. But if you really like the language you'll want to play with numpy and manage to code in python without running any python
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Thanks for the advice, have you ever been able to code a decent GA/search AI or similar in python on codingame?
 Alshock: hmm, I've done some but they were all prototypes and I always switch to C++ at some point when I need to optimise
 n0b1e: Is it possilbe to reach highest league with python only?
 Alshock: yes it is
 n0b1e: albeit harder?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: AIshock fair enough
 Alshock: I can't say harder as some like te language syntax and libraries, but I can say though  that at this level of optimisation the interpreter mostly just runs C code
 n0b1e: I see, thank AIshock
 Alshock: I can say harder if I only look at the languages used by the people in legend
 Alshock: but there's some reputation effect as well
 C26_1: @all
 C26_1: Is there some kind of another program when deal with multi programming language
 C26_1: Like when we want to share a variable between a python file and a C++ file
 C26_1: Something like that
 derjack: mixed language application?
 C26_1: yes, I guess?
 C26_1: Most of the time, you don't need deal with that
 C26_1: But I think someone make a program where Python is calculation, C++, C, C# for fast, Java for object, something like that
 derjack: maybe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html">https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html</a>
 derjack: for java you can use c/c++ via jni
 C26_1: ok
 Sandra_28:  vania durak:innocent:
 Aquajag: i'm new here. i'm not new to coding but it's been a long time and im trying a new language. a lot of the "easy" starter things in loop also use concepts not yet introduced, like arrays. where do i go on this site to learn about how to walk through an array, manipulate values, etc.
 n0b1e: Acrivities &gt; learn &gt; choose your language
 Aquajag: thanks
 n0b1e: np
 Aquajag: funny that when following the tutorial the first thing they do is throw me into clashes before they teach me anything....
 n0b1e: yea i think its good to learn first, can be difficult for complete beginners
 n0b1e: hang in there
 n0b1e: go through algorithims and data structures first
 Aquajag: ty
 Press_F_to-Cesar: i am without pants

 2010david: not completed
 Uljahn: why post then? to get some downvotes?
 Westicles: aren't downvotes going away?
 Cybermonkey2023: Does anyone know a good C++ tutorial video?
 Westicles: I saw some discussion on discord mod channel...
 Uljahn: already having two WIP contributions, guess it's better to invest in quality
 eulerscheZahl: "I saw some discussion on discord mod channel..."nice try, we didn't discuss that on the mod channel
 eulerscheZahl: only here in public
 Westicles: oh, I was confused
 Copy05: this game showed me how much i suck at coding
 Press_F_to-Cesar: fgff
 Yonten: hi 
 Manjius: what game
 Medoo: codeine
 linjoehan: hey I forgot it's AOC time again
 Illedan: AOC :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: you guys play that for real?
 Illedan: Sure
 eulerscheZahl: but tasks open at 6am, no way to compete
 Illedan: Got some nice stories
 Illedan: Why compete?
 Illedan: Do it for fun
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 Illedan: And look down on the rest of my company that chickens out around 16th of December when it gets harder xD
 BlaiseEbuth: You're so 5% toad... :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: got one of my colleagues into NNs :D
 eulerscheZahl: he has these plastic stones that he wants to sort by color (about 16 different colors). has a sensor and some mechanic to move them separately, controlled by arduino
 eulerscheZahl: asked me for a good way to detect which color it is. told him NN if he wants to learn something. and he really started
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.amazon.de/Ikea-Steckperlen-Versch-Steckperlenplatte-Zubeh%C3%B6r/dp/B00CL830QA/ref=asc_df_B00CL830QA/?tag=googshopde-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=207984733117&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9962968377361801279&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9042621&amp;hvtargid=pla-456619435860&amp;psc=1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.de/Ikea-Steckperlen-Versch-Steckperlenplatte-Zubeh%C3%B6r/dp/B00CL830QA/ref=asc_df_B00CL830QA/?tag=googshopde-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=207984733117&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9962968377361801279&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9042621&amp;hvtargid=pla-456619435860&amp;psc=1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1</a>these ones, not sure how to translate
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it even says "pyssla Beads", stupid me
 Illedan: Sounds like a fun project xD
 BlaiseEbuth: Sounds like it'll be faster by hand...
 eulerscheZahl: he already got it moving so far that he gets single ones in front of the sensor and reads the color code
 eulerscheZahl: next he has to drop them at the right place
 linjoehan: lol I'm at a new company so still tryingto get em into it
 linjoehan: Also I just learned python It's a nice way to learn a new language properly somewhat
 Ben...: :expressionless:
 Andrisssd: Whats up friends
 Ben...: he
 Ben...: he
 Ben...: he
 eulerscheZahl: 1 is enough
 Wontonimo: that sorting project sounds great eulerscheZahl.  I think probably a classic support vectors or principle component analysis would also do the trick without having to dive into NNs.  Possibly just classic feature engineering
 Wontonimo: like taking the average colour of the image
 eulerscheZahl: i told him that it's total overkill but also a fun way to dive into it. he watched a youtube intro (from 3brown1blue) hours later in his lunchbreak
 jacek: who uses NNs for trivial matters :unamused:
 Stephen20: COULD SOMEONE
 Stephen20: PLEASE TELL ME
 eulerscheZahl: neural network
 jacek: no nut november
 eulerscheZahl: i mean NEURAL NETWORK
 Stephen20: like what the heck does that mean
 leojean890: Hey&#160;:) do you know why there is no RAIC this year&#160;?:)
 eulerscheZahl: postponed to February
 leojean890: oh I see^^
 leojean890: thanks:)
 eulerscheZahl: neural network: given some known inputs (e.g. picture of a digit) and output (the digit value) you try to extract patterns with fancy math
 eulerscheZahl: describing supervised learning here. there are more types
 eulerscheZahl: but that's the simplest one

 Astrobytes: Not sure why I bother with this webchat any more
 Dr_Dealdoe: Why is it even a thing?
 Astrobytes: It used to be good
 Dr_Dealdoe: It's not like someone is gonna come across these puzzles and say "Gee, the chat might be good at suggestions!"
 Astrobytes: Well, actually, it is if you come at the right time and ask a reasonable question
 Astrobytes: Far better during contests
 Dr_Dealdoe: A reasonable question for a contest?
 Astrobytes: No the chat is far better during contests
 Astrobytes: Discussing strategies etc
 Dr_Dealdoe: Alright.
 Astrobytes: Generally speaking, people will help you out in the chat if you have a legit question about something specific, relating to a multi or puzzle
 Astrobytes: Just there's a lot of spammy crap these days
 Astrobytes: Illedan: ping

 sauceyo: um guys
 sauceyo: why is print() a thing in js 
 Westicles: sauceyo, if you want to file a complaint about it, I'd be happy to arbitrate
 BartholomewIII: sauceyo it's to remove an advantage to some languages during a shortest CoC since you normally have to use console.log
 BartholomewIII: Then again, ruby just uses `p`
 BartholomewIII: *grumbling*
 xangeliczx: bro what
 BartholomewIII: You can use `p` instead of `puts`
 sauceyo: really
 BartholomewIII: Yep
 sauceyo: The amount of times ive looked up how to use ruby on shortest mode

 ZXC01: lol
 UZUHAMA:&#160;:(
 ZXC01: quite true
 Rin_Smd: haahahah
 Superwog1: I am so addicted to this I do clash of codes more than all the times kids in my class have gamed
 Superwog1: (didn't ask + didn't care + ratio)
 ZXC01: ok
 UZUHAMA: I'm so addicted to this website itself
 UZUHAMA: So many interesting things
 Rin_Smd: exactly buttrying to solve one makes me depressed ..hahah
 UZUHAMA: But it feels so good when you actually solve one
 UZUHAMA: I think that's why I like coding
 Rin_Smd: its glad to hear that... but i just after burnout phase after few months of intership and now im ready to learn new things ...
 UZUHAMA: Ooh an internship
 UZUHAMA: I heard that's really tough
 Rin_Smd: yes, developing edu management website for gov.. 
 UZUHAMA: That's an awesome job!
 UZUHAMA: Wow
 Rin_Smd: ahahahha.. then burnout and now I'm back hahahah
 ZXC01: .......
 UZUHAMA: I did felt burnout, too
 Rin_Smd: just realize that i need to learn alot and lack of know
 UZUHAMA: Yeah, me too
 UZUHAMA: When I finished online course on programming
 UZUHAMA: I thought I was ready to program
 UZUHAMA: But then I realized I'm the biggest noob in the world
 Rin_Smd: which online course did you enroll? 
 UZUHAMA: ICS Cabada
 ZXC01: never heard of it
 UZUHAMA: I think it was called Programming Languages 
 UZUHAMA: Canada
 UZUHAMA: Not Cabada
 ZXC01: you should start with some easy languages
 Rin_Smd: exactly same with me... while solving the puzzle games. I realized how stupid i am  
 UZUHAMA: Hey, but that's ok
 Rin_Smd: great, have u try the Havard one, i heard about free courses there (online) 
 UZUHAMA: I mean, look at my profile picture
 Rin_Smd: i saw that (ur's profile)
 ZXC01: lol heart attak
 UZUHAMA: Yep
 UZUHAMA: But I still love coding
 Rin_Smd: yes heart attack, while me stay unknown (my proflile pic)
 UZUHAMA: I know that I'm getting better and better at coding, even if I don't realize the difference at first 
 UZUHAMA: You're same
 UZUHAMA: You're getting better 
 UZUHAMA: So don't give up now
 UZUHAMA: Burnout doesn't last that long
 UZUHAMA: Cheer up
 ZXC01: bye gtg
 UZUHAMA: Bye
 MynameisDuy: YAY
 UZUHAMA: What happened
 MynameisDuy: I RANKED 1/5 :DDD

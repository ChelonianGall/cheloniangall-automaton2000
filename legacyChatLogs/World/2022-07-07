 ImSeaFu: Has anyone seen wontonimo in the last week or so? Haven't heard from him in a while and just worried that something happened to him
 5DN1L: he was here a few days ago
 jacek: hes mourning the chat
 Aldoggen: the chat that apparently is still holding on for dear life
 kamkamkil: hi, is there any option here to create a "group" for multiple people or you only can add individual frieds&#160;? 
 5DN1L: no
 kamkamkil: ok :disappointed:
 Aldoggen: do you mean for clash of code?
 kamkamkil: no, in general, so multiple people could quickly see what other are doing  
 kamkamkil: i'm on programming discord and i would be fun if multiple people could join smth like that 
 5DN1L: the most you can do is to filter a leaderboard
 Aldoggen: there is a possibility to add individual friends, but no groups as 5DN1L said
 Lachrymosa: So chat is actually planned to be removed? Will discord become the defacto replacement?
 Smai: Discord&#160;:(

 Smai: Why does clash of code say every one is a winner?
 Aldoggen: from what do you gather that?
 Aldoggen: what makes you tell everyone is a winner?
 5DN1L: a quote on that page
 Smai: The description
 Aldoggen: ah
 Smai: I want people to know they lost
 5DN1L: that's evil
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 Aldoggen: lmao if you're first that should be satisfaction enough, right?
 Lachrymosa: RIP chat, wonder if theres any way to port over the twitch moderation system or some clone of it. I echo what a lot are saying in the forum post; The life of CG is the sidebar chat.
 Smai: no.
 Smai: Is there a private message function
 Aldoggen: are you gonna tell people they lost? in that case there is no such function
 Aldoggen: :smiling_imp:
 5DN1L: lol
 Smai: They should know
 Smai: Why does this have skype emojis
 Aldoggen: :smiling_imp:
 Smai: :skull: what is this
 Smai: Thats not good
 Aldoggen: skull
 xx_zero: skype emojis?
 xx_zero: those r nothing like skypes lol
 xx_zero: skype's emojis are a lot worse
 Smai: Skypes look traumatised
 Smai: What did they do to my man the neutral face

 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 Aldoggen: better than this guy :no_mouth: he doesn't have a mouth
 MSmits: unsettling
 Aldoggen: yo
 Smai: The nerd emoji aint good neither
 MSmits: yo
 Smai: That doesnt feel like a slap to the face
 Lachrymosa: !fish Smai
 Smai: I am a minor.
 MSmits: don't think of yourself that way
 MSmits: have some confidence
 Lachrymosa: I haven't used it in a while, but there was some command that slapped a named user

 Aldoggen: I felt like it was still more a response than spam, but I'll take it easy now
 5DN1L: Smai what brings you to this website?
 Smai: Why do you wanna know?
 5DN1L: Curious :shrug:
 Smai: Teacher said to do it ig
 5DN1L: oh, which subject is that
 Aldoggen: that's a nice teacher you have

 Darleanow: hello everyone, i'm trying to print an ascii form
 Smai: Yes Mr.5DN1L
 Smai: Sandle?
 Darleanow: and like to animate it through carriage return; i know that it works for one line, but what if for \nseparated lines&#160;?
 Darleanow: like to emulate a circle turning on itself for example
 Darleanow: (Hey 5DN1L tho)&#160;:)
 5DN1L: hi Darleanow
 xx_zero: sorry bro cannot help u when it comes to that ascii art thing i have no clue where to start
 5DN1L: Good to know, Smai, you have lots of coding opportunities here if you like coding too
 Aldoggen: Darleanow, what I did in the past was using some escape codes to get the cursor back up the lines you've printed and overwrite them
 Aldoggen: don't know if that's what you want, but it functions a bit like clearing a frame and redrawning it
 Smai: Cant i just cheat clash of code with random number generator?
 5DN1L: you can
 5DN1L: if you don't mind losing
 Smai: If you lose you arent cheating correctly
 5DN1L: indeed
 Smai: Do you get paid to mod this chat or is it free time?
 5DN1L: i'm not paid
 Smai: Negotiate with the owners
 Smai: Get that bag
 5DN1L: yeah i probably should
 5DN1L: thank you Smai
 xx_zero: Â£7 an hour :fire:
 Smai: The number thing worked
 Smai: Its saying i got 0% score but all the tests worked
 5DN1L: because your code is tested against another set of hidden cases
 xx_zero: how do we know ur telling the truth
 5DN1L: it's up to you
 Smai: So i cant be creative with my answers
 Aldoggen: you can, they just need to be general enough to solve the problem
 Aldoggen: instead of only solving the test cases

 AlvaroAlonsoGiraldo: test
 mrsridhar: hi
 lifetimeLearner007: Is there a way to start a private chat with someone I saw getting 100% in a clash. I need to understand his code
 5DN1L: click their name to start a private chat
 lifetimeLearner007: Nah, it just goes to their profile page
 Frankich: or /msg his username
 5DN1L: you click their name not their profile pic, lifetimeLearner007
 lifetimeLearner007: It is not clickable. Its a text element
 lifetimeLearner007: I tried /msg but it just says &lt;username&gt; not found on the chat
 5DN1L: then that's the reason
 5DN1L: my method works, but that other person has to be online too
 lifetimeLearner007: well, I see a green dot on his/her profile pic which means he/she is online right?
 5DN1L: maybe he/she was
 5DN1L: i suspect the profile online status may not be updated frequently
 5DN1L: can't say for sure, though
 lifetimeLearner007: I got the rainbow problem in the clash where a string and a ruleset string is given and we need to check if the string has the chars in the ruleset in that order in the given string. 
 lifetimeLearner007: Last 2 test cases didn't make sense to me but this guy got 100% and in his code I see 'AZERTYUIOPMLKJHGFDSQWXCVBN' hardcoded
 lifetimeLearner007: I just want to know what this string is and how it is relevant to that rainbow problem. It is not given in the question
 5DN1L: is it the one which requires you to output Rainbow accepted/denied?

 lifetimeLearner007: yes
 jacek: he copied the contribution solution&#160;:?

 lifetimeLearner007: yes, that is the puzzle I got in clash.

 mrsridhar: hell ehllo
 5DN1L: we can't see any code shared, lifetimeLearner007
 Frankich: We can't see his code, can you copy paste it in the chat somehow
 5DN1L: chat pastebin is broken
 5DN1L: anyway
 Frankich: arf
 5DN1L: if the code is copied and pasted, you may report him/her on his/her profile, lifetimeLearner007
 lifetimeLearner007: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/0iKvahRL">https://pastebin.com/0iKvahRL</a>
 lifetimeLearner007: I don't know if he copy-pasted it. I just wanted to understand it. 
 5DN1L: it's just the full alphabet
 lifetimeLearner007: but why that particular order?
 5DN1L: maybe he would type it faster that way
 lifetimeLearner007: I thought so too
 lifetimeLearner007: But it doesn't follow sequence of keys in the keyboard like QWERTY... or ASDF...
 jacek: its azerty keyboard <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY</a>

 5DN1L: np
 5DN1L: thanks to two channels, i guess
 lifetimeLearner007: Is A* the proper way for BlockTheSpreadingFire problem? Is there any better approach?
 5DN1L: Maybe you need A* plus other stuff
 5DN1L: some have suggested Simulated Annealing
 Lachrymosa: Just finished my first "Hard" puzzle. I used to be really intimidated by them, nice to see progress :D
 5DN1L: ð
 jacek: :smirk:

 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 Aldoggen: the very hard ones do some time tho
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/recurring-decimals">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/recurring-decimals</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: A few are not so hard
 5DN1L: you need to be an expert to understand recurring decimals
 Lachrymosa: Is there some math that will identify repeating blocks easier? I'd probably run into an issue where theres a repeating block 20 digits long and not catch it until the 40th or something
 BlaiseEbuth: The barnyard for instance is trivial if you do it with numpy :smirk:
 5DN1L: can there be a repeating block of 20 digits?
 Lachrymosa: idk, math is a fact of life, but one i don't gawk at for too long
 5DN1L: ah yes
 5DN1L: it can
 Aldoggen: I'm pretty sure repeating parts can be as long as you want them to be
 5DN1L: really based on the denominator
 Lachrymosa: so then there is some determinate math that will let you know how long of a repeating segment there is? 
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: there are just so many combinations of divisions
 5DN1L: given a specific denominator
 5DN1L: there's a limit
 Lachrymosa: then that very hard problem may be less hard and more about knowing math better
 5DN1L: it's not hard actually
 lifetimeLearner007: success rate is 5% lol
 5DN1L: it's more a misclassification of difficulty upon introduction of difficulty level
 BlaiseEbuth: It's the probleme of the problems classification. "Hard for how?"
 BlaiseEbuth: *who
 Lachrymosa: I feel like Zerg Rush wasn't as hard as it was labeled as
 Lachrymosa: either difficulty creep is happening or it was mislabeled as well
 5DN1L: try it
 5DN1L: you should be able to solve it within 24 hours
 Lachrymosa: the decimal one?
 5DN1L: yes
 Lachrymosa: I'll bookmark it, I'm about to leave the office in a bit
 5DN1L: I agree, BlaiseEbuth. but it's all relatively speaking, comparison between puzzles as well
 5DN1L: to a new programmer, even an easy puzzle can be difficult to them
 Lachrymosa: If there was some rubric of techniques and concepts that were racked and stacked it could be used to decide difficulty better
 Lachrymosa: It originally took me 3 months of trying to solve the first non-tutorial puzzle on this website :V
 5DN1L: and you've improved since then&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: greatly!
 MSmits: dedication
 MSmits: which puzzle?
 Lachrymosa: Zerg Rush today
 MSmits: no, i mean the one that took you 3 months
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes, of course. And the old puzzles suffered from a lack of available comparisons when they were graded.
 Lachrymosa: Oh, I think it was the blasting mountains one
 Aldoggen: oof
 MSmits: the descent?
 Lachrymosa: that one
 jacek: 3 months?
 MSmits: the difficult thing to understand there is that you have 2 loops. One input loop and one loop over mountains to blast
 Lachrymosa: I completely misunderstood how this site's input output structure worked and I was originally using C++
 5DN1L: I guess so, BlaiseEbuth
 MSmits: I totally get why this was hard Lachrymosa
 MSmits: and the input structure is a major hurdle for people starting out
 Lachrymosa: Also completely self-taught coder using free time after working 10 hours a day XD so don't think of it like 3 straight months, it was whenever I wasn't getting food and crashing
 Aldoggen: ah, yeah, sounds more reasonable then
 MSmits: ahh I see
 Aldoggen: still, props for dedication
 Lachrymosa: I love computers. Coding is more of a fun hobby for me though. I've gone the DFIR route
 jacek: DFIR?
 Lachrymosa: detection forensics investigation response
 Lachrymosa: Digital Forensics and Incident Response* sorry
 BlaiseEbuth: When I first registered to CG back in 2013 there was no binding between the test files and the standard input. You had to read files manualy. As a beginer it was so frustrating to not even be able to read the input that I quit the site immediately for a time. :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: ouch
 MSmits: most other sites are still like that I think
 MSmits: you get a bunch of files and you need to do it yourself
 MSmits: people who complain about CG don't realize how far ahead of the competition CG is in this regard.
 Lachrymosa: I've had a year long hiatus at one point I think, but that was between moves a few years back. Lost contact with a dude named Samsi in that time, real bummer cause him and I collaborated a lot
 Lachrymosa: haven't seen Maddy for a while either
 Aldoggen: man, I love that testing is as easy as clicking a button. didn't know other sites didn't do this
 MSmits: CG ruined me. I can't try other sites. They immediately turn me off
 BlaiseEbuth: I complain about CG precisely because they have a fantastic environment/system/community and are wasting it MSmits&#160;;)
 Aldoggen: it's so satisfying when you play all testcases and they just work when you're barely half a minute in CoC
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth that's different
 Lachrymosa: codewars does a decent job, but the site feels too sterile and structured.
 Lachrymosa: 0 multiplayer fun too. Unless you want a well akshually fest in their "multiplayer" solution thing.
 MSmits: yeah the multiplayer thing here is truly unique
 MSmits: other sites have mostly puzzles and optimization
 Aldoggen: what about the chat?&#160;;)
 MSmits: pretty sure the other sites will have discord or other channels
 Aldoggen: yes, I'm opening this can of worms again
 MSmits: haha no thanks&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: codecombat has a really good angle with E-Sports league for coding, but its tailor marketed towards kids 10-16 or so
 Aldoggen: lol
 Lachrymosa: CanOfWorms.close()
 Aldoggen: forgot the semicolon
 Lachrymosa: Python ;3
 Lachrymosa: semicolons are for winky faces only
 Aldoggen: should have used with

 Lachrymosa: whats that?
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cheloniangall.com/">https://cheloniangall.com/</a>
 Lachrymosa: can't click unknown links here
 Aldoggen: type them in browser bar
 Lachrymosa: its more of a moral obligation than a physical limitation
 Aldoggen: relevant text in the website "The CodinGame chat deletion is imminent... There is still work to do here, but the XMPP server is up! You can already create an account and connect to the chat directly on the site or from your favorite XMPP client!"

 Aldoggen: when does it create a pastebin like that?
 MSmits: Lachrymosa you will miss out on all of jace k's rickrolls with that attitude
 Aldoggen: I missed out on all of them so far
 Lachrymosa: At home I'll click w/e I want. Its just this machine isn't mine :V
 Aldoggen: no fomo
 BlaiseEbuth: More than 4 lines creates a pastebin

 5DN1L: Aldoggen why are you copying and paste stuff here? for Lachrymosa to see?
 Aldoggen: yep
 Lachrymosa: kek
 Aldoggen: that was the last paste
 Aldoggen: whatever
 Aldoggen: they even want to save Automaton2000 bot
 Automaton2000: that was a cool game
 Aldoggen: ^
 Lachrymosa: I know it was buddy, I know it was
 5DN1L: they = BlaiseEbuth, Aldoggen
 Lachrymosa: they.append(Lachrymosa)
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. I'm a lot in my head
 Lachrymosa: half crazed chatbots like Automaton2000 are comfy
 Automaton2000: i have never heard of it
 Aldoggen: BlaiseEbuth, are you making ChelonianGall?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup
 Aldoggen: oh, nice&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: didn't really realize
 Lachrymosa: is it just going to be a chat site?
 MSmits: I might use it just to cheer myself up looking at the dancing turtle
 BlaiseEbuth: The main thing is the xmpp server, the webchat is there for those who don't want tu use an app client.
 Lachrymosa: Write a plugin for your browser that sticks the chat from the site in the right panel of a website XDCG Chat in every tab now!
 BlaiseEbuth: And for the turtle
 Aldoggen: yes, the turtle should have its own spot&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not a bad idea Lachrymosa :thinking:
 5DN1L: is there a story behind the turtle?
 Lachrymosa: poppin shells :sunglasses:
 Aldoggen: aren't chelonians turtles?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Making Automaton2000 say 'tortue' is an old joke on #fr
 Automaton2000: yeah it seems silly. unless it's in retaliation to all the competitive coding places that disqualified ru players because of ...
 5DN1L: ah i see
 Aldoggen: that response was quite nice actually
 Lachrymosa: It has its gems
 Lachrymosa: I go now, pce
 Aldoggen: cya!
 Sheeesh---: guys i'm trying to learn MCTS i just wanna ask about the simulation/rollout part let's say it's tic tac toe should i just do random moves and see the winner or is there a better way&#160;? 
 Aldoggen: can I try to answer this first?
 Aldoggen: I'm trying to learn
 Sheeesh---: go ahead
 Aldoggen: agh the terminology is unfamiliar. simulation is the part where you're going over a part of the tree you haven't explored yet right?
 Sheeesh---: it's when you wanna give a score to a node as fas i know
 Aldoggen: so what I gather from this paper I've read, is you can do random moves, but a better idea is to implement some from of heuristics to see what moves are interesting
 Sheeesh---: oh i see
 Aldoggen: that will significantly improve the performance of mcts
 Aldoggen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 5DN1L: try the basic one first
 Dapps: it also depends on what you're problem space is. some areas are difficult to write a heuristic, and mcts with random movements can basically "figure it out"
 Aldoggen: the things I've said are on page 28, in the first paragraph of play-out
 5DN1L: the one Aldoggen describes is a modification of the basic algorithm
 Aldoggen: aah all right
 5DN1L: it's better to understand and code the basic one first
 Sheeesh---: ok then
 Sheeesh---: gotta go step by step
 Sheeesh---: thanks guys&#160;!
 Aldoggen: ty guys for revising my answer&#160;:)
 struct: Sheeesh--- when you do rollout
 struct: normal rollout is just random
 struct: but you can improve it afte
 struct: after*
 struct: to do smarter moves
 struct: For example if you can win on next move you play the winning move
 struct: Block opponent from winning moves
 struct: stuff like this
 struct: Also are you doing normal TTT?
 Sheeesh---: that's my play
 Sheeesh---: after it i will go to UTTT to beat y'all
 struct: yeah thats what I did as well
 Sheeesh---: my plan*
 struct: I then copy pasted most of it to uttt
 struct: But are you going to use python?
 Sheeesh---: nah
 Sheeesh---: python is really slow
 struct: yeah
 Sheeesh---: i experienced it when i did mars lander with genetic algo
 Sheeesh---: it was literaly 10000 time slow
 Sheeesh---: tines*
 Aldoggen: wow
 Sheeesh---: than my c implementation
 Westicles: I'm getting gaslit on my contrib
 Aldoggen: yes, I've succesfully implemented arbitrarily precise long division
 5DN1L: on recurring decimals?
 Aldoggen: yes
 5DN1L: nice
 Aldoggen: now for the recurrence detection
 MSmits: think this is a new record for me. Solved 26 moves before the end: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/649997374">https://www.codingame.com/replay/649997374</a>
 MSmits: I don't even care if it wins more or not. Love that solving&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: oof, nice
 Aldoggen: how do you know it was solved?
 struct: his mcts found a path that lead to a win
 MSmits: i output "win"
 Astrobytes: it outputs win
 Aldoggen: ah
 Astrobytes: sometimes the simple answer is the answer&#160;;)
 MSmits: I do it mainly because it is a good debugging tool. Yurko spotted a bug for me the other day because it outputted something wrong
 Aldoggen: til you can see the bot outputs in the replay
 Astrobytes: you can't see them? Refresh
 MSmits: it says below the profile pics
 Aldoggen: I had to open something
 Aldoggen: oh below the pics?
 MSmits: in the viewer yeah
 Aldoggen: I probably need glasses then
 MSmits: but beyond frame 43, otherwise its not solved
 Aldoggen: found it
 MSmits: kk
 YurkovAS: my bot without a fast solver is play good too&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I got Alice and Bob first time and had to refresh :D
 Westicles: problem has nothing to do with recursion.  one guy solves it with recursion, one guy says it should be medium due to recursion, one guy says it should be medium due to recursion with recursion tag
 MSmits: yeah it's only a tiny advantage yurko
 MSmits: karlis o doesnt even have a solver
 MSmits: i just like solvers :0
 Astrobytes: yeah, as MSmits says solver is just useful more than anything else
 Astrobytes: and matters more in other games than some
 Aldoggen: Westicles they're doing it with math instead of simulating it I guess
 MSmits: i like it also because when i run meta mcts locally, the games are much shorter
 Dapps: what does it mean to have a solver?
 MSmits: you prove the win or loss
 Westicles: Aldoggen, if they used math it would just be a formula.  Maybe it is some voodoo approach only the french know 
 MSmits: so if you prove the win, it means you win even if the other player plays perfectly
 Dapps: is that basically brute force full search? or other ways
 MSmits: it's brute force, but if you make some smart choices you can go deeper with it
 Dapps: ah got it
 Aldoggen: Westicles I'm gonna see if I can solve it
 Dapps: so something like alpha beta search
 MSmits: yes
 Aldoggen: after recurring decimals tho
 MSmits: i do something like ab pruning but for mcts
 Astrobytes: on your probability one Westicles?
 Dapps: i've been having a lot of fun with uttt. but i think i've gone as far as i can with C# lol
 Westicles: Aldoggen nice!  Looking for a recursion comment
 Westicles: Astro yes
 Dapps: i don't know how people got into legend with it
 MSmits: it's very hard Dapps
 MSmits: i got into legend with it
 Dapps: very impressed!
 MSmits: I did use bitboards and such
 MSmits: efficient random rollout
 Astrobytes: It seems kinda straightforward, not sure where the dude got recursion from...
 MSmits: around 20k rollouts per turn
 Dapps: i've maxxed out at around top 180 gold
 MSmits: do you use mcts or minimax/
 Dapps: yeah i use bitboards, mcts, not sure what does efficient rollouts mean? i use uniform random
 Astrobytes: and what is that guy who commented on your other contrib smoking... "Add 2 or 3 examples of what a "greatest common divisor" is. The CoC summary should be self-sufficient as per the rules"
 Westicles: heh heh
 MSmits: oh, well there are many ways to code a rollout, some are faster than others
 MSmits: one thing you can do is make a win lookup
 MSmits: winArray[512]
 eulerscheZahl: i have that
 Westicles: greatest common denominator is like the perfect name to describe what it is
 Westicles: *divisor
 eulerscheZahl: 2 actually, one for the small board and one for the large
 MSmits: yeah i do too
 eulerscheZahl: large board lookup is bigger than 512
 MSmits: it's even faster than an avx win check and we had a really fast one
 Astrobytes: lol, right Westicles!
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl yeah 
 MSmits: uint8_t bigBoardStatus[65536] = { 0 };
 MSmits: i store 4 results in 1 byte
 eulerscheZahl: i think mine is 3**9 in size
 eulerscheZahl: too long ago
 MSmits: hmm not for bigboard i think
 MSmits: you have 4 types of miniboards
 MSmits: unfinished, p1 win, p2 win, draw
 eulerscheZahl: i jacek around? i have 2 memes for him
 struct: wait are you telling me that I need a bigger table for the bigboard?
 struct: to check if a player won?
 MSmits: if you want to include draws yeah
 eulerscheZahl: board can be p1, p2 or open
 MSmits: it can also be draw eulerscheZahl, thats different from open
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: but i treat them the same i think
 eulerscheZahl: don't want to check
 MSmits: yeah thats better than having no lookup
 struct: ah I see, I just use the 512 one
 struct: for both boards
 MSmits: i like to add the draws because then you can also cut short games where neither side can win or one of the two sides wins by boardcount
 MSmits: the larger the lookup, the slower it is though
 MSmits: if you want to go really heavy on the lookups you can even have less than 3^9 for miniboards
 MSmits: because half the boards are finished boards and it doesnt matter how they got finished. there's only 3 types of those
 MSmits: p1/p2/draw
 MSmits: that leaves only 8629 possible miniboards
 MSmits: better than 19863
 eulerscheZahl: i tabbed away for a few seconds and now there is a wall of text waiting for me
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Smits Sermons ftw :D
 MSmits: I was just done :P
 eulerscheZahl: no jacek? i'll share it anyways<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/a81OM8Q">https://9gag.com/gag/a81OM8Q</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/a81Oy0Z">https://9gag.com/gag/a81Oy0Z</a>
 Dapps: i don't have a winlookup for the big board, could add that in
 MSmits: that second one is awesome!
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: unexpected
 Astrobytes: best you-know-what ever
 MSmits: too bad the sound defaults to off
 Astrobytes: does it have sound?
 Aldoggen: both are nice
 Aldoggen: I had a wall of text waiting for me and I didn't even alt tab lol
 Aldoggen: just too busy on recurring decimals
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think jacek would highly appreciate both of those
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl did you see this one yet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RxqNv6bEug">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RxqNv6bEug</a>
 MSmits: (john oliver)
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: so funny
 Westicles: I remember when talk shows made fun of both political parties, now they just make fun of one
 MSmits: apparently you did not see the video
 Westicles: no, don't like that guy
 eulerscheZahl: that's the advantage of more than 2 parties: you can be for one of them and still make fun of several others
 MSmits: Westicles he's going on for 10 mins about creepy beached dolls
 MSmits: there's no politics
 eulerscheZahl: a few weeks about he analyzed a movie about a dog playing basketball
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: and also, he's not really very often targeting specific parties, mostly talking about the absurdity of some facts of the US
 jacek: oh my!
 Astrobytes: watched that one the other night MSmits, superb
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't worry Westicles, I make fun of all americans without discrimination. :grin:
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl yeah i saw that too, so funny
 jacek: that would be nice in bt statement
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Westicles: BlaiseEbuth I am shocked!  I have the utmost respect for all french
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: :french_bread:
 Astrobytes: Yet another thing I will miss about chat. Westicles vs France
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't worry I make fun of all french too.
 Westicles: :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Humanity is so fun...
 MSmits: oh the humanity
 Astrobytes: ...damentally flawed. Yes
 Astrobytes: I'll miss killing chat too. I'm so good at it.
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000! Group rez'!
 Automaton2000: so you want to see a solution to the puzzle
 Astrobytes: Automaton2000 has the answers eh
 Automaton2000: they've played tens of thousands of games
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 what do you think about Westicles puzzles&#160;?
 Automaton2000: to see if that works
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 what do you mean?
 Automaton2000: so it's a good idea to make a good bot
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 so you're saying a bot would be easier than westicles puzzles&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i can see that it is really good at it
 Darleanow: Automaton2000  you're right 
 Automaton2000: because you need to use a nn for this contest
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 make sense please
 Automaton2000: and you are at the same time
 Darleanow: Automaton2000  you solved retaining water with a O(n^2) solution&#160;?
 Darleanow: impressive
 Automaton2000: is there a way to get back on track
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 try to code a bit more i guess
 Automaton2000: not being able to solve any of the bot
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 but you are a bot
 Automaton2000: every time i do a histogram and choose the best one
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 what's your purpose&#160;?
 Automaton2000: ok, i don't know how to code it
 Astrobytes: lol
 Darleanow: Automaton2000  you need to type it..
 Automaton2000: well if you want to have to check for a win
 Darleanow: (he's tired i guess)
 Darleanow: Automaton2000  i'm letting u afk a bit
 Automaton2000: you can submit in different leagues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 ride them like a pony
 Automaton2000: so if you had to do with that
 derjack: oO
 Nerchio: did the russian cup already start
 Aldoggen: yes. it even got startled and spilled all over
 Astrobytes: 5 minutes I think Nerchio
 Astrobytes: at least i think it is
 Nerchio: ah ok
 Nerchio: so can we participate
 Nerchio: or i need shady russian bank account
 BlaiseEbuth: No money for you
 Astrobytes: not sure 
 Astrobytes: they said it would be updated in the FAQ
 Astrobytes: (the organisers)
 Astrobytes: first week is beta anyway, best wait for bugs to be fixed
 Nerchio: and for the game to get additional crazy rules? ^^
 Astrobytes: lol, that comes after :D
 eulerscheZahl: they also made completely new rules at the end of beta once
 eulerscheZahl: an atomic bomb to prevent unit stacking
 Aldoggen: take care when you participate. in russia, bugs find you
 Astrobytes: oh for the rts one
 eulerscheZahl: 2016 i think
 Astrobytes: *first rts one
 Astrobytes: with the big phalanxes of units
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Nerchio: in 2016 i didnt know what programming is
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 Astrobytes: innocence lost!
 Nerchio: and euler was already dropping nukes in russian ai cup
 eulerscheZahl: really Nerchio? you started coding that late?
 Astrobytes: which is better? SC competitions or AI bot competitions?
 Nerchio: ai competitions since they have more variety, the problem is you can't win with java and even if you win you don't get too many prizes :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: join topcoder
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl eh I mean I probably did but at that point I wouldn't call it coding really
 Nerchio: i tried but I don't know where to click on their site :joy:
 Astrobytes: Nice! Turned to the dark side.ofc you can win with java, depends on the contest
 eulerscheZahl: my first topcoder experience was similar
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd was an optim tasks i didn't like
 Astrobytes: all my topcoder experiences were like that until I bookmarked it
 Nerchio: i opened like topcoder arena or something and there was like a calendar or something but couldnt find any tasks
 eulerscheZahl: 4 years between account creation and my first contest i played seriosly
 Nerchio: so didnt bother much longer 
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder arena is for algorithmic challenges only
 eulerscheZahl: like the puzzle section here
 eulerscheZahl: they also have an optim section. and some paid jobs
 Nerchio: ok so where do I go for real stuff
 eulerscheZahl: better copy the URL, you can't click it:
 jacek: this one you can <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>

 Nerchio: you almost got me jacek
 Astrobytes: never gonna click that
 jacek: never gonna give you up
 BlaiseEbuth: XcQ :eyes:
 Nerchio: it's like jacek discovered internet yesterday
 jacek: so, they put chat removal to friday evening after all
 Astrobytes: the pawn one though :D
 Nerchio: it's fine we've all been there
 Astrobytes: ofc jacek
 Astrobytes: Nerchio :rofl: yes, every day he rediscovers it I think
 Nerchio: so eulerscheZahl you participate in things from this list when they come up?
 Astrobytes: Marathon Matches, yes
 eulerscheZahl: for dates: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/">https://clist.by/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: expand the topcoder thing in the white area at the bottom
 eulerscheZahl: they even increased the prize pool
 struct: so it starts on 13-07?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tco23.topcoder.com/competition-rules">https://tco23.topcoder.com/competition-rules</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yes, next Wednesday
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh great. I'll take a look
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So, we need to gamble on who get's last chat msg logged?
 Nikanameu: NASA comet detection! now that's a contest
 Nerchio: i only see some topcodr 09.07 and 22.07 on that clist site lol
 eulerscheZahl: that's a part 2 actually. in part 1 they found 2 completely new comets with the contest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: SpaceX super heavy launching next week, and James Webb photos released bext week
 Astrobytes: bext week is the week before?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Oh, virtual comets?
 Astrobytes: Real comets.

 Nikanameu: what are those links man
 MSmits: recent contest where java or python or C# did well
 MSmits: well not recent
 MSmits: some 2 yrs old
 jacek: 'recent'
 eulerscheZahl: add ghost in a cell to your recent list
 MSmits: feels recent :0
 Astrobytes: afk 
 struct: you can get  top 15 in C4 with java
 MSmits: well... that's because it's a small amount of top players
 struct: still he would be the first with java
 MSmits: true
 Nerchio: why do you think top15 is possible
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 MSmits: because he can get top 15 with 10% performance
 struct: not 10
 struct: 5
 Aldoggen: bold of you to assume that java can get 10% performance
 Nerchio: :D
 struct: im sure java is not 20x slower
 Aldoggen: as long as GC doesn't kick in lol
 MSmits: you can avoid GC with object pools
 Aldoggen: ah right
 Aldoggen: just remember everything
 MSmits: you wont be reusing your tree from previous turns, then you need only like 1 million nodes
 MSmits: you can survive initializing that many
 MSmits: tree reuse is overrated anyway
 Aldoggen: so you don't reuse your tree, but you keep it?
 struct: I did reuse it
 struct: but thats because i forgot to remove it
 Nerchio: i have only MAX_NODES = 250000;
 Nerchio: in c4
 struct: let me see how many nodes I get
 MSmits: might be enough except in turn 1 Nerchio
 Nerchio: i have hardcoded opening
 MSmits: works
 MSmits: I have 35 million nodes in uttt :P
 Nerchio: o.o
 Aldoggen: whoa&#160;:)
 Nerchio: how much memory it takes
 MSmits: almost all
 struct: 45M in C4
 Aldoggen: how much do you get actually?
 MSmits: how many do i use?
 MSmits: i use the whole array if my opponent doesnt play moves I pruned. I will have to reset the tree because i run out
 Aldoggen: no, I mean what's the max memory anyone can use?
 MSmits: 780 MB or so
 MSmits: around that value
 Aldoggen: but that's interesting to know too&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: all right
 struct: 768MB
 struct: ok I submited with 5ms again and 50 for first turn and no reuse
 Aldoggen: that seems familiar
 Nerchio: it's 25&#160;165&#160;824 ints?
 struct: it shows the number of rollouts
 MSmits: They are node objects
 Aldoggen: ah, it's 2^8*3 MB
 MSmits: usually my nodes are 10 to 12 bytes or so
 MSmits: actually no
 MSmits: make that around 20 sorry
 Aldoggen: so you're using around 680 MB
 MSmits: wins/visits is 8 already, then an index to the first child is another 4, thats 12 bytes, then some random stuff like childcount (1 byte) and solved status and scuh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, at depth 4 I use 126MB, very innefficient
 MSmits: that sounds right Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: that's because I used a calculator
 Nerchio: i have only like Rollouts 22216 per turn
 MSmits: in uttt it almost always resets much sooner though, I will agressively prune in the opening gome
 Nerchio: in c4 so yeah
 struct: 22216 on first turn?
 Nerchio: no
 Nerchio: on like turn 10
 Aldoggen: sounds like a good strat, opening is where you generate a lot of unneeded stuf
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/650029694">https://www.codingame.com/replay/650029694</a>
 struct: this is with 5ms Nerchio
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 170k nodes = 126MB ... i guess i suck
 MSmits: Aldoggen you still have to be careful with pruning, but uttt has some nice heuristics for the start of the game
 struct: smart rollout
 Nerchio: yeah I just did barebones mcts 
 Nerchio: don't have anything smart
 MSmits: if you change your rollout to smart it will help wayyyy more than if you change your code to c++
 Nerchio: what is a smart rollout
 MSmits: moves arent random
 MSmits: not completely
 MSmits: you dont play moves that cause you to lose
 MSmits: so if you place a disk somewhere where there is a winning move for the opponent righ tabove that it is dumb
 MSmits: also if you dont block opponent it is dumb
 Nerchio: so you need to have some lookup?
 Nerchio: to see winning moves
 MSmits: well i have to admit we use SIMD to find these, but you could do some loops
 struct: no need loops
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/09-anticipate-losing-moves/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/09-anticipate-losing-moves/</a>
 MSmits: ah right, yes there are smarter ways
 Nerchio: so it's heuristics
 MSmits: yes, but not heuristics that bias the search
 MSmits: you only prune proven losses
 MSmits: so those are moves you would never play anyway
 struct: for example a rollout goes from 25 moves average if its full random
 struct: to 33
 struct: or something
 MSmits: Yavalath is a similar game where smart rollout is way more important than performance
 MSmits: pb 4 had a similar strength bot compared to mine with 5x less sims
 Nerchio: I will see later if I have the patience to go back and add it to my code but looks good :D

 MSmits: heh heh
 struct: if you play on middle you will lose
 MSmits: well it's likely
 MSmits: it's almost 100% certain to be solved as a win for the person who plays it
 MSmits: 3 and 5 are even better though
 MSmits: possibly the only draw is 1 or 6, that makes them the only safe starts
 struct: maybe I should try opening with 2
 struct: to see if it makes any difference
 MSmits: 2 also favors player 1 and i will steal it, but the book will be poor
 MSmits: so it might belp vs me
 MSmits: help
 MSmits: NN's might also perform worse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just rollout 9^64 games, I'll wait

 Astrobytes: Yeah I think it looks fun
 MSmits: fortnite without the stupid building
 struct: stuff is so small
 Astrobytes: zoom in lol
 Astrobytes: use the mouse/mouse wheel to change the view
 Astrobytes: in realtime 
 struct: I'll probably skip, too much stuff going on
 Astrobytes: you have a whole month in case you change your mind
 eulerscheZahl: press "v" for debug mode
 eulerscheZahl: was the same last time
 Astrobytes: Yep
 eulerscheZahl: i might go for a low effort tshirt
 Nerchio: MSmits building is/was the best part of fortnite :D
 MSmits: it seems silly to me, it's way too fast
 MSmits: i like how it works in rust
 eulerscheZahl: oh wow, round 1 at RAIC starts on the 15th already
 Astrobytes: euler, nnovich messaged me again, he's as confused as us; asked for confirmation but the telegram chat is flooding currently
 eulerscheZahl: usually there were 1 or 2 weeks more, weren't there?
 eulerscheZahl: i see. won't be too hard to reach top300 i think. easily doable on a lazy Saturday
 eulerscheZahl: so i might just risk not getting my tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise it would probably be the easiest of the year (not counting hacktoberfest)
 MSmits: doesn't it bother you that it is always t-shirts. I figure you'd need pants and shoes and stuff as well
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes it's hoodies
 eulerscheZahl: and once i won a cup
 eulerscheZahl: the thing that keeps your coffee warm
 eulerscheZahl: i don't drink coffee
 MSmits: oh ok, i was imagining something else
 eulerscheZahl: i realized the double meaning, which is why i clarified
 BlaiseEbuth: Any news about the banks thing?
 MSmits: like you were only wearing t-shirts before, but finally got a cup so you would no longer get arrested
 eulerscheZahl: johnathan banks is still active, BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: MSmits :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get that
 BlaiseEbuth: :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: it's possible t-shirt shipping for those without accounts is for displaced RU nationals (given the current situation) but also possible it's for non-RU entrants, we need to await the official answer
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm 'k
 Astrobytes: the out of competition round states it's for VK employees and those who worked on task development, but there are 2 leaderboards, one for in-competition and one without, so as per RAIC there is some strangeness
 Astrobytes: anyway nnovich will update me with any news so I'll pass it on as soon as I hear anything
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:+1:
 Nerchio: who is nnovich, some kind of special agent?
 eulerscheZahl: i once played in a mini RAIC. it didn't even have English rules
 eulerscheZahl: a user who's also active on CG
 eulerscheZahl: top20 in the pikaptcha puzzle contest
 eulerscheZahl: was so happy about it that he shared his solution on the chat
 Astrobytes: Nerchio: just a CG user, the guy who posted the link to it
 eulerscheZahl: then got DQed&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: oh that was him?
 Astrobytes: ouch
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: didn't do pikaptcha but I remember
 eulerscheZahl: i was barely faster than smits
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. But I didn't asked: The bank account prevent you to register or it's just about prizes?
 eulerscheZahl: started really well with the first 2 tasks. then got confused about MÃ¶bius strip
 eulerscheZahl: you can register without an account
 eulerscheZahl: just for fun
 eulerscheZahl: only thing we don't know: do tshirts still count as fun or as serious competing?
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Well that's all OK.
 BlaiseEbuth: Erf
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah t-shirts is a serious issue
 Astrobytes: oh btw, the shorter duration before Round 1 start is because they combined beta and sandbox this year
 eulerscheZahl: ah, so changes until directly before R1?
 Astrobytes: seems that way
 Astrobytes: its on the site but doesn't give more info than that
 eulerscheZahl: and half of it is Russian even when you select English
 Astrobytes: heheh yeah it's a bit peculiar
 eulerscheZahl: if i play, i should do it this weekend. otherwise it will collide with TC
 Astrobytes: good idea
 DrunkeyCPP: is the TC challenge worth for noobies learning a language? 
 DrunkeyCPP: or is it too hard?
 eulerscheZahl: last 2 tasks to get an impression:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/9bb1c5e1-dbb3-4407-be0e-3cc0dc45bf1a">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/9bb1c5e1-dbb3-4407-be0e-3cc0dc45bf1a</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/d9570afb-dfde-43b0-b4e1-20434933c8cc">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/d9570afb-dfde-43b0-b4e1-20434933c8cc</a>
 eulerscheZahl: they have animations. but you have to log in to see them&#160;:(
 DrunkeyCPP: well I wouldn't even know where to start, so I guess that answers my question haha
 DrunkeyCPP: thanks doe :thumbsup:
 struct: its usually similar to cg optimization right euler?
 eulerscheZahl: you can't hardcode on TC, so no :D
 DrunkeyCPP: lol
 eulerscheZahl: but somewhat comparable, often with visuals
 Astrobytes: and usually high quality problem
 eulerscheZahl: a tester for local development
 eulerscheZahl: here's an animation as the one on the website doesn't play without account: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935525847140536320/976536014938067034/seed1_3.gif">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935525847140536320/976536014938067034/seed1_3.gif</a>
 eulerscheZahl: basically was about building long chains with one knight to get max points
 eulerscheZahl: always capturing the same color
 DrunkeyCPP: seems really fun but yeah, I guess I'm not on that level yet
 eulerscheZahl: you learn by pushing yourself to the limits
 Astrobytes: keep practising&#160;;)
 DrunkeyCPP: sir yes sir
 Astrobytes: indeed. Get out of your depth but get something working
 eulerscheZahl: on a side note: there are finals once a year. it's not easy to qualify but would be really good to use this as a community gathering. so everyone join&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ^
 DrunkeyCPP: that also sounds like great fun 
 eulerscheZahl: they will even invite you to the US
 Mikkuuu: hello guys
 Mikkuuu: :grinning:
 struct: ok I might try if I can bitboard it
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: afk, eating
 Illedan: ifok, coding
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, what actions can you do in the RAIC?
 eulerscheZahl: compete for fun, compete for real, not compete?
 WereEnder: bro its so hard
 WereEnder: to code
 Illedan: No, more like
 Illedan: Move left right?
 Illedan: Or continous?
 Illedan: Shoot?
 Illedan: Magic?
 Illedan: Nuke?
 eulerscheZahl: i saw 1 replay, it was laggy. that's it
 Illedan: Kamikaze?
 Illedan: ok
 struct: are replays on green circle playing faster?
 struct: or is just me
 struct: ah I guess its due to the card animations
 struct: frames are still 1 sec
 WereEnder: Can someone help me. Im new to coding and I really have no idea whats happening
 Razovsky: this is not a website to learn
 Razovsky: but to practice
 Razovsky: check the forum
 WereEnder: whats a website to learn?
 Razovsky: lots of tips for beginners, but to summerize 5DN1L u should arrive here knowing the bases of a langage
 Razovsky: loops, if/else, in/out commands 
 WereEnder: whats a website to learn?
 Razovsky: try google "learn to code"
 Razovsky: to begin with
 5DN1L: or try codecademy.com , 'The Coding Train' on youtube, or first levels in codewars.com
 Razovsky: im not your mom
 Razovsky: thx 5DN1L XD youre so much patient
 5DN1L: just copy and paste :P
 Razovsky: love you
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Need :taco: bot to automatically reply on these questions
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pokemon.fandom.com/de/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Wiki">https://pokemon.fandom.com/de/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Wiki</a>learn all about pokemon here.you should ask more accurate questions
 5DN1L: wasn't paying attention to the chat until you pinged me Razovsky
 WereEnder: ok ty
 5DN1L: Illedan, yes indeed
 TomAlard: I'm trying to improve my UTTT bot. I've got a basic pure MCTS implementation. Are there any substantial improvements I could make other than optimizing the code?
 MSmits: many
 MSmits: well, when i say many, i mean many small things that each add a few&#160;% to WR
 eulerscheZahl: to world record?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: try the following heuristic TomAlard
 MSmits: in the first 20 turns or so, whenever you have to play on an empty board, pick the square that has the same position on the board, as the miniboard has in the overall board
 MSmits: meaning, the square that forces your opponent to play on that board as well
 TomAlard: You mean doing that instead of random rollouts?
 MSmits: nah, do the randomrollouts if you want, just play this move if it is available
 MSmits: you could also force this through expansion (when you expand and this move is available, have it as the onyl child)
 MSmits: you can see it in action here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/650069725">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/650069725</a>
 TomAlard: Interesting
 MSmits: it's generally best to limit this to the first 20 turns
 MSmits: after that, sometimes it's a losing move
 MSmits: i mean 20 plies
 MSmits: (both players moved 10 times)
 MSmits: it is not just a gimmick... it's an extremely strong heuristic
 MSmits: random rollouts will not give you a better move
 TomAlard: Thanks! I'll try it
 MSmits: np, there's more ideas like this. Ask me when i'm around
 TomAlard: Yeah, I heard you're trying to improve your UTTT bot as well
 struct: this should bring you from 100 to 50th +-
 MSmits: yeah i am
 struct: just this heuristic
 TomAlard: damn
 MSmits: ran out of ideas mostly, but trying the eval version again. I had a reasonable good one before
 MSmits: no random rollout, was ranked about 20th or 30th
 struct: yours?
 MSmits: but my normal bot is 7-9
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: mcts with ept
 struct: ah
 TomAlard: I wonder who found this idea
 MSmits: it was a bit unstable
 MSmits: it would beat recurses nn with a 50% + WR and then lose to lower ranked
 struct: maybe because it played bad
 struct: :p
 MSmits: maybe
 MSmits: but it didnt just play well vs recurse
 MSmits: it did well vs other top guys
 MSmits: it just couldnt deal with some gamestates i think that only pop up with weaker players
 MSmits: eval is not as flexible as a random rollout
 struct: yeah
 putibuzu: have you tried combining rollout and evaluation function? 
 MSmits: putibuzu not really, i may have at some point, but never with some serious effort
 putibuzu: MSmits alright thanks&#160;:) was just wondering since The_Duck is using something like this in green circle successfully&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah it sometimes works, but uttt doesnt have a very reliable eval 
 MSmits: best you can hope for is averaging it out
 MSmits: to something reasonable 
 MSmits: over many visits
 MSmits: just as you would with random rollout
 putibuzu: ah ok good to know, I have no clue about UTTT to be honest. thanks!
 DrunkeyCPP: whats uttt?
 BayraktarBakh3ridzeIG: d
 BayraktarBakh3ridzeIG: a
 BayraktarBakh3ridzeIG: j
 5DN1L: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
 DrunkeyCPP: ah thanks
 5DN1L: np
 YurkovAS: in my case: smart rollouts give 15% wr vs only random rollouts. checked in brutal-tester 1Kx2 mirrored games
 MSmits: you mean +15%&#160;?
 YurkovAS: +15&#160;%
 MSmits: ok, sounds about right
 MSmits: looks like my evalbot ends about 30th
 MSmits: (the old one)
 MSmits: I want to try and improve it
 struct: just need to use jacekeval
 MSmits: hah yeah that would work
 struct: but you do ept(0) MSmits?
 MSmits: yes
 struct: does it do worse if you do like 10?
 MSmits: it is otherwise basically the same bot, with all the solver enhancements and heuristics
 MSmits: 10 what?
 struct: 10 moves then eval
 MSmits: oh randoms, i never tried
 struct: Its what I do for bt
 MSmits: is it better than straight eval?
 struct: for me it was
 MSmits: how much better? Easy to prove with tests?
 struct: ok i just tested on leaderboard tbf
 MSmits: mmh hard to say 
 struct: it was from 20 to top 10 or something around that
 MSmits: thats good
 MSmits: if i were to add random rollout to eval bot it would go over 3k i think
 MSmits: mmh eval bot was still going up, 22nd now
 struct: I just use the normal rollout and then stop at depth N
 struct: oh nice
 MSmits: only 1 pt below you now
 MSmits: I just got the dumbest phishing mail
 MSmits: it asked me to fill out a survey
 MSmits: it's like it just doesn't want to phishing to succeed... a survey lol
 struct: better fill it
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: double win vs tomatoes and supson
 struct: it does well for an eval
 MSmits: so close to the struct now&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah it does
 MSmits: i must have remembered it wrong, it was stronger
 MSmits: not sure why i gave up trying to improve it. It may have the potential to be stronger than my random rollout bot
 Afraaz1: Hey guy I'm stuck on the descent easy minigame
 Afraaz1: Anyone around to help?
 struct: press hints on the left
 PiPrevalis: Afraaz, you may be having the same issue I was which I was using the same variable for biggestHeight and rewriting that with the index. I'd check the largest height and update a new variable for the index and return the index not the height variable
 PiPrevalis: or I apologize that's a totally different game don't mind me... lmao
 Afraaz1: no thats the same game
 Afraaz1: thank you
 Afraaz1: for some reason i shoot the same mountain over and over
 PiPrevalis: oh no worries! Hope that helps!
 Afraaz1: ill have to add an array
 Afraaz1: that does help
 Afraaz1: i was returning highest height not index
 struct: yeah you can also have 2 vars
 PiPrevalis: yeah I was shooting mountain 4 every time lol
 struct: so you keep track of the highest_mountain_height, highest_mountain_index;
 struct: you will need to store both
 PiPrevalis: ^that's how I ended up doing it, without creating a new array
 Afraaz1: how does that stop you from firing the same mountain over and over
 Afraaz1: ohh
 Astrobytes: overwrite it every time you see a higher value
 Afraaz1: i need to reset the variables
 struct: if they are inside the while loop
 struct: they are reseted
 struct: because it goes out of scope
 Afraaz1: thanks i was putting the reset outside the loop out of habit
 Razovsky: hey 5DN1L
 Razovsky: U Talked about codeacademy earlier
 Razovsky: i went on the website, it might be what i was looking for actually, so thanks
 Razovsky: i have langage and algorithm knowledge thanks to this website, but i don't know how to build usefull competences for a real job as a dev
 Astrobytes: yo Razovsky, regarding CTFs and things for stego challenges, check CTFTime.org and sites like hackthebox for non-competitive CTFs. Sites like hackthissite etc are good for practicing on a puzzle-type basis
 Astrobytes: *CTFtime is for contest CTFs
 Razovsky: thx Astrobytes
 Razovsky: crypto really please me
 Astrobytes: here's another list:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2018/12/19/practice-hacking-with-vulnerable-systems/">https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2018/12/19/practice-hacking-with-vulnerable-systems/</a>
 Razovsky: thx&#160;!
 Razovsky: u rock
 Astrobytes: np&#160;:)
 Razovsky: by the way what would you advice to somebody which never study computer science but who manages to do well on this site and might consider switching to dev/computer science jobs&#160;?
 Astrobytes: donno, never did a CS degree
 BlaiseEbuth: :popcorn:
 xAzaelx: Dunno bout other countries, but in Germany i"d say always yes
 Astrobytes: yes to what?
 DevJacob: SW Dev/engineer is a great position. You get paid to be stressed!
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: why the popcorn?
 xAzaelx: Consider going for a dev job
 Astrobytes: ah
 BlaiseEbuth: Because it's good?
 xAzaelx: because its easy to get a job and its well paid
 xAzaelx: and if you have fun coding anyways that a huge plus
 BlaiseEbuth: Was answering to Astrobytes.
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you want popcorn?
 Astrobytes: Razovsky: I'd probably start by learning some frameworks, tech stacks etc, make a meaningful portfolio of projects on github, contribute to OSS projects
 jk_java: Razovsky: go for it, if you do well here, you will lern what is required fast in real life as well
 jk_java: you will be fixing somebody elses code anyway
 Astrobytes: but don't ask me, I do well on this site but no CS education or dev job
 jk_java: most real life devs woudl not do well here tbh
 BlaiseEbuth: You almost have a phd in an interesting domain and you deliberately want to drop it to become a corporate slave? :think:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ only time i agree w/ mr. demon
 Astrobytes: what is the phd?
 PiPrevalis: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: what domain I mean
 jk_java: Razovsky: maybo also consider going into data science - the coding there is more about solving problem and datascience is in high demand
 jk_java: also DevOps - small programs that automate deployment and super high demand now
 BlaiseEbuth: Geology iirc.
 Astrobytes: How dare you call geology interesting! Blasphemy!
 Astrobytes: (never enjoyed that :D )
 Astrobytes: but yeah, I'd finish that first before anything else
 BlaiseEbuth: Do we already had a disagreement PatrickMcGinnisII? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: that's a lot of years of hard work to throw away
 jk_java: there might be CS jobs in geology i guess as well
 jk_java: most science is data science
 PatrickMcGinnisII: have a good day, i could debate the computer guru stuff for hours, but I have actual RL stuff to do.  My Galleon Wars improves everyday, not that I have resubbed it yet.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 Astrobytes: I've used my knowledge in various domains/jobs over the years
 jk_java: :cocktail:
 Astrobytes: never used an MCTS or alphabeta at any job mind you :P
 BlaiseEbuth: What did I do to Patrick? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: nothing afaik
 BlaiseEbuth: :shrug:
 Razovsky: ill throw nothing away
 Razovsky: and i do way better than casual geology
 Razovsky: im a seismologist darling
 Astrobytes: ugh, even worse. Moho measurements made me fall asleep
 Razovsky: but as i have facilities in coding, and research is an unstable domain
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Razovsky: i am asking myself on becoming a dev
 Razovsky: Astrobytes if i had been ur teacher
 Razovsky: u would have love every bit
 Astrobytes: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Well... Slavery is pretty stable
 Astrobytes: well, you know you best, pretty sure you can combine CS and seismology though
 Astrobytes: best of both worlds
 Astrobytes: And yeah, research isn't all it's cracked up to be
 Afraaz1: anyone does the ASCII art challenge
 daddy0resist: stfu
 daddy0resist: stfu
 daddy0resist: stfu
 daddy0resist: stfu
 daddy0resist: im sexy big black dude
 daddy0resist: slavery is good because we are putting a toaster inside my toaster
 MSmits: what song is this?
 IhorKostiuk: Wow
 IhorKostiuk: How to get an Internship
 IhorKostiuk: So tough
 Astrobytes: don't do what that other guy did
 BlaiseEbuth: Make great coffee and nice photocopies.
 Spressed: Hello guys
 derjack: :upside_down:
 MSmits: my eval bot is close to 45% vs my random rollout bot now
 MSmits: was 32% before
 MSmits: if i can tweak it more, maybe it can get better
 Cakeboy57: bla bla
 MSmits: that's what i said
 derjack: uttt?
 MSmits: yeah
 derjack: eval in uttt? :scream:
 MSmits: yep
 Aldoggen: whoa, you were 8th with random rollout?
 MSmits: well everyone and their mom uses random rollout on uttt
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: my mom doesn't
 MSmits: that you know of
 Aldoggen: what kind of eval?
 Aldoggen: XD
 MSmits: just features that make sense for an uttt board
 Nerchio: if(loss) eval -= 100000;
 MSmits: winning miniboards and such
 Aldoggen: I'm gonna play devil's advocate here. is there no way for a procrastinate-winning-miniboards-and-catch-up-later kind of strategy to be viable?
 MSmits: yeah definitely
 Aldoggen: so winning miniboards doesn't necessarily mean winning the game
 MSmits: correct
 Aldoggen: or i guess it depends at what depth you're looking
 Aldoggen: if you're looking near the end of the game it would probably be ok
 MSmits: no this is a universal truth. Winning miniboards does not mean winning the game
 MSmits: but it can help
 Aldoggen: ah, all right
 Aldoggen: still don't know the rules&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats why i have a bunch of features
 MSmits: with parameters
 Aldoggen: at first I thought you needed to treat the big board like a normal ttt
 MSmits: well you kinda do
 Aldoggen: now it's just a matter of tuning the parameters&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah working on it
 MSmits: as long as it beats my other bot i'll be happy
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:
 MSmits: need to get from 45% wr to 50% + 
 Aldoggen: you could do something with gradient descent maybe
 derjack: how many params?
 MSmits: i should yeah, but i need to get a pipeline for that
 MSmits: 8 params
 MSmits: atm
 derjack: brute force it is, then
 MSmits: might drop some and gain some new ones
 Aldoggen: I think assuming strength of the bot is smooth in the parameters is a pretty bold statement tho
 MSmits: yea at first will do brute force
 MSmits: it's not, there's definite local optima
 YurkovAS: how many rollouts you have? &gt; 60k in 2 turn?
 MSmits: way more
 Aldoggen: I won't deny there are local optima, but idk if gradient descent will work
 Aldoggen: but good luck&#160;:)
 MSmits: 1 million rollout on first turn, dunno 2nd, it has visits from reuse
 MSmits: 255k visits on 2nd turn, but that includes from root
 MSmits: 164k visits on 3rd
 YurkovAS: root visits?
 MSmits: 150k on 4th
 MSmits: yeah backpropagated to root
 Nickkkkkk: Hi&#160;:)
 MSmits: but i reuse tree so it keeps visits from earlier turn
 MSmits: oh wait nvm i do keep track of rollouts
 MSmits: it's around 100k
 Westicles: Only needs one more approval. ASCII art!
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23544778f13fa4bdcec80adea8db1bc2c4f4f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23544778f13fa4bdcec80adea8db1bc2c4f4f</a>
 MSmits: brb
 YurkovAS: MSmits 100k rollouts with smart playouts phase?
 YurkovAS: or only random
 MSmits: no, this is a new bot
 MSmits: it has no playouts
 MSmits: selection -&gt; expansion -&gt; eval
 MSmits: it ranks around 12th
 MSmits: pretty happy with it
 MSmits: needs more tuning though, maybe it can go higher
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>
 MSmits: look what I did to Bowwow =)
 YurkovAS: :thumbsup:
 Aldoggen: you made him bow
 PewPewBewm: M$mits... you're welcome&#160;: )
 struct: finally positive win rate vs MSmits
 struct: I can finally retire
 MSmits: not compared to my best bot struct, but i definitely improved evalbot
 YurkovAS: and vs me :smile:
 MSmits: no it seems to suck vs you. From cg stats it also seems very unstable. I guess it's more deterministic because no random playout
 struct: add rand to select like jace k
 PewPewBewm: Ooops.sorry .... Westicles Y W&#160;: )     Apologies, can't see straight today.  Got code eyes&#160;: )
 MSmits: i might add rand yes struct
 MSmits: would help with the tuning i guess
 PewPewBewm: Westlicles.  I ran your submission a few days ago.  Just gave it its third approval.
 Westicles: Well done PewPewBewm!  The french are going to hate it :P
 PewPewBewm: Man, I need to sleep ... I am a zombie.  27 hours awake and counting... been living on coke and headache tablets.
 PewPewBewm: Gonna sleep before my body decides to hurt me bad
 PewPewBewm: o/
 Psyho: did people try RAIC? is it fun? 
 Psyho: is it morally good to participate there? :thinking:
 Psyho: *is it moral
 struct: I didnt like the viewer so I decided to skip it :p
 struct: Also no money prizes if you dont have a russian bank account
 YurkovAS: MSmits for smart rollouts i evaluate all moves, sort by score and choose by random: best moves choose frequently (FastRand(movesCount + N))
 Psyho: "Also no money prizes if you dont have a russian bank account"I would donate it anyway, honestly
 struct: thats fair
 MSmits: sounds complicated YurkovAS
 Astrobytes: Psyho: for me personally there is no moral issue for this kind of thing, I have zero issues with ordinary russians
 TimeEngineer: Hey struct, did you understand what Jacek mean when he said -Qmax&#160;? Is it for player who win too&#160;?
 YurkovAS: rollouts count drop from 70k -&gt; 40kwinrate +15%
 Astrobytes: I thought it was kind of unfair that a lot of sites excluded RU participants, was glad CG did not
 struct: derjack
 TimeEngineer: Oh MSmits is there too&#160;!
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits: :cheer:
 TimeEngineer: :wave:
 Psyho: I guess I look at it from the company perspective: what's the relation between VK (sponsor) and the government
 Psyho: most places I've seen just disallowed Russian people to represent Russia (which I think is... okayish?)
 Astrobytes: It's a minefield (not a pun) really/
 Astrobytes: *really.
 MSmits: participation as an individual only representating yourself, should be ok in any case
 struct: a quick search and it seems to have ties to it psyho
 struct: TimeEngineer im not sure about what jacek said
 struct: My knowledge of NNs is pretty bad
 Astrobytes: Yeah we know struct, that's the moral dilemma 
 TimeEngineer: Oh
 MSmits: Qmax sounds like the highest value child
 TimeEngineer: Yeah
 struct: ah I thought he meant as a question, my bad
 MSmits: -Qmax could refer to the parent gettign the value of the negated max value child
 MSmits: but i am totally guessing
 Psyho: " amid a significant overhaul of the firmâs shareholder structure that has seen state-owned entities assume control" ah yeah
 Psyho: struct: that was a question, yes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ah I thought you were aware
 Astrobytes: my bad
 Psyho: that would be my blind guess, but I didn't check
 Psyho: + mostly I'm just curious what do people on CG think about it
 Psyho: but yeah, it's essentially competing in a contest sponsored (indirectly) by russian government
 TimeEngineer: For my DQN, in tic tac toe, I used the same NN for training, the common case is to propagate Qcurr(s, a) = R + yQmax(s')where s = state and a = action
 TimeEngineer: But Jacek mentionned -Qmax
 darkhorse64: I would not touch it with a ten foot pole
 Astrobytes: it's only this year that there is this issue
 darkhorse64: even before
 Astrobytes: yeah I know, you said in 2020, but I'm just pointing it out&#160;;)
 Darleanow: BOBLOB

 darkhorse64: I do not see participating as safe and now there is a moral on top of that
 struct: Ctrl+F Qmax
 darkhorse64: a moral issue
 darkhorse64: you may call me paranois
 TimeEngineer: Oh thanks&#160;! struct
 darkhorse64: paranoid
 darkhorse64: :mask:
 struct: I understand you darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: It would be slightly odd for them to distribute malware in their runner or whatever tbh but I get you
 Astrobytes: I believe that a competition full of programmers would have noticed something amiss by now.
 darkhorse64: I meant personal safety
 CipherEmber: Should I choose webdev or gamedev? I want to do something interesting and useful for the world. I'm having a hard time choosing.
 Astrobytes: Personal info or physical darkhorse64?
 struct: CipherEmber <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLAi_cmly6Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLAi_cmly6Q</a>
 darkhorse64: personal info
 Psyho: gamedev = fun, lower wages, crunch timeswebdev = boring
 Astrobytes: what you give is minimal, and if there was strange data gathering going on it would have been noticed I'm sure
 struct: also depends on the company ofc
 darkhorse64: I have a complete distrust in everything that comes from this country even though I have been once there and loved the people, culture, ... 
 Astrobytes: that's fair, and understandable
 Psyho: out of curiosity: where do you trust in Chinese software on that scale?
 Psyho: *where do you put
 darkhorse64: the concern is more about the government. In both cases, very low
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't trust that either
 CipherEmber: what are you talking about
 CodoMojo: Hi, i have just a simple question how much 10^26 equal in base Ten??
 MSmits: it equals 10^26
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: That's like the person asking for examples of what the greatest common divisor is
 CipherEmber: the greatest common divisor ls 10^26
 CipherEmber: :D
 Zorg1: but in which base&#160;?
 CodoMojo: OH,I Got it thanks.
 CipherEmber: Approximately 800 employees laid off from Activision Blizzard
 CipherEmber: OMG
 waterproofsodium: # AI is real&#160;?
 CipherEmber: real, but Is it possible to create consciousness?
 MSmits: sure it is
 waterproofsodium: who cares if it takes our jobs?
 MSmits: just find someone of the opposite sex and get crackin'
 waterproofsodium: mankind creates problems faster than they solve them..
 MSmits: speak for yourself. I solve a lot more problems than I create. Did not make one contribution so far and solved 100+ puzzles
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 Nerchio: sounds like a parasite :joy:
 MSmits: and proud of it
 MSmits: if more people were like me, Westicles would have a life
 waterproofsodium: I was neither speaking for you nor for me. I spoke about the average. obviously we're still not out of nuclear war era given the current situation so that problem is not solved as one example. but already new ones are on the horizon which we don't know how to deal with
 waterproofsodium: hopefully the trend is changing, but I cannot bet on that
 PewPewBewm: I'm an fully optimised problem generator some days&#160;; )
 CipherEmber: Horizon Zero Dawn comes true.
 Astrobytes: waterproofsodium: I believe he was joking&#160;;)
 PewPewBewm: You ever start the day with code that was beautiful and just needed a couple of little tweaks ...
 waterproofsodium: oh ok :P
 PewPewBewm: :P
 Westicles: MSmits, the puzzles are coming at a trickle these days, so lots of life here
 Astrobytes: PewPewBewm: Have you heard of this fancy thing called version control? :P
 PewPewBewm: I have... it's on my todo list...
 MSmits: ah good to hear Westicles
 CipherEmber: I love math. Codding after math and it made fractal cabbage 
 CipherEmber: :D
 PewPewBewm: there's infinite vitamins in a fractal cabbage...
 waterproofsodium: MSmits I finally understood your joke :D
 MSmits: yes some of my jokes age like fine wine
 waterproofsodium: I shall put the next one in a shelf to consume later
 MSmits: preferably in a cold environment

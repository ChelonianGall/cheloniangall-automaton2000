 Jaek: how do i get CodinPoints in code golf&#160;?
 markyy: Tychkorg could you please share your code?
 Chloris: tychkorg is a bot
 Allis: There are eleven bots, all public knowledge.
 Allis: Oh, sorry; I missed that you were responding to someone.
 Jaek: Allis do you know something about code golf&#160;?
 Allis: The idea of writing code using as few characters as possible? Sure. But not much about CodinGame's golfing area.
 Allis: It would be odd if you don't receive points for completing the golf challenges, but I don't know the particulars.
 Jaek: Ill just keep shrinking my code and see :p
 Allis: Sounds like a plan!&#160;:)
 Uljahn: here in codegolf you can make more than one solution with different languages, and your top 5 submissions will be taken into account in CodingPoints calculation
 jacek: ohai
 Solacefire: Is it the same with clash of code for ranking?
 IsThisWhereMyNameGoes: Bro no
 marawanmo: e?
 fschuetz04: If it's public knowledge, is there a list of bots?
 MitsukiVuejs: yow
 marawanmo: hi
 Uljahn: fschuetz04: i guess you can detect bots by the number of clashes played, there is a sorting option in the CoC leaderboard
 jacek: stockfish12 is released
 jacek: the charts are noice <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Regression-Tests">https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Regression-Tests</a>
 MitsukiVuejs: i hope people share there code so i can view whats wrong
 MitsukiVuejs: and how to solve it
 tutubalin: fschuetz04 look at this link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a>
 tutubalin: whoever has more that 48k clashes while still being lvl7 is a bot
 Uljahn: those 7lvl with 48k+ clashes are def bots
 anantaCodes: How do I report plagiarism?
 fschuetz04: @Uljahn @tutubalin Thanks
 anantaCodes: I just found out users cheating 
 anantaCodes: By posting SO answers and submitting within secods.
 marawanmo: :nerd:
 Allis: @anantaCodes There are Clash solutions on SO?
 tutubalin: i think create question on SO -&gt; wait for answer -&gt; post in CoC takes more than 15 minutes
 anantaCodes: Yes I found out a problem which was too generic and within secods answere were posted. I saw one of the shared code and My fears were proven right
 anantaCodes: The guy literally lifted the accepted answer code from SO and pasted t
 Uljahn: im not aware of such a rule that forbids to use internet search in general or SO in clashes
 anantaCodes: @uljahn So you encourage Copy Paste code so that rakings improve?
 Allis: It is almost never the case that you can straight-up copy-and-paste from somewhere on the internet to solve the problem.
 anantaCodes: It is in this case
 anantaCodes: The problem was to covert integer to roman number notation
 Allis: Yeah, that's unfortunate.
 PkZ: Does anyone know if multiple threads can take the same element from an array in Go?
 Allis: Out of the box, Go collections are not thread-safe.
 Uljahn: anantaCodes: you can rate the clash low, make a comment about easily searchable solution and hope they delete that clash
 anantaCodes: Ok, sure&#160;! Thanks for clarifying that&#160;! @Uljahn
 Marchete: NNUE jump is huge
 tutubalin: PkZ there are thread-safe counterpart for Go maps. not sure about other collections
 java.lang.InvalidStateException: hello there
 marawanmo: h
 marawanmo: i
 BigBadWrestlerOfDoom_9bb3: hi
 XXIT: general kenobi
 Meis: hi
 Aurixmas: haraso
 Meis: :grin:
 MitsukiVuejs: guys share your code dont just keep te
 MitsukiVuejs: it*
 MitsukiVuejs: so others may laern
 MitsukiVuejs: sad community
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: share your code
 Automaton2000: are u gonna do it
 anantaCodes: They need to make this sharing thing more visible. I always orget because of the placement of the button below. Put that button same row 
 anantaCodes: And also change the color to something catchy and add a small animation so that it catches the user's eyes
 [CG]Thibaud: good point
 Solacefire: I think about 25%-50% of Python 3 users are just copy-pasting their answers from github accounts
 JBM: too many similar answers?
 Kaffi_PL: Hi All
 eulerscheZahl: JBM i came across your blog post about optims in regards to the quest map. does this help?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/tree/master/optim">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/tree/master/optim</a>
 JBM: nope&#160;:)
 JBM: already discussed it with maintainer
 eulerscheZahl: ok :D
 JBM: iirc it doesn't go far enough
 JBM: which is why i ended up coding mine
 FunkySausageVonKirschenwald_afc6: hi
 eulerscheZahl: the graph on your profile page has the CP for each single day i think
 eulerscheZahl: so take top X and visit their profiles. or maybe that's what you did
 eulerscheZahl: anyway, getting ready for sports.see you
 JBM: that's a bit better but theoretically nt enough
 JBM: but I might end up doing it anyway, to complete the data
 Mr.Fishman: is this chat separate from the discord?
 Uljahn: yes, this chat is xmpp-based
 Zwiebelsirup: help
 Zwiebelsirup: please
 Zwiebelsirup: someone wants to buy my kidney? I need a better CPU than i3 2100&#160;:(
 Skwerl23: They sell laptops 10x better for 300 bucks&#160;?
 TheMysteriousGhosts_4095: Hello
 moymoy: Hi
 TheMysteriousGhosts_4095: How are you?
 moymoy: Eating icecream
 TheMysteriousGhosts_4095: ooh great
 moymoy: &amp; u?
 TheMysteriousGhosts_4095: just chilling
 Sidh07: hey Moymoy
 Asta971: You guys have any advice to go faster
 Allis: Go faster?
 Asta971: When programming
 Asta971: I did some codingames for job interviews, and I always end up short on time
 nihilistRegem: Why is there no intelliSense?
 bearrar: hi
 Val25: Hi
 L_Dawgy_Dawg: Hi, is there an etiquette re. when/whether to launch a CoC before time?
 MSmits: L_Dawgy_Dawg don't think so
 MSmits: If you launch it too soon, you'll simply have less opponents
 MSmits: but they will too, so it's fair
 MSmits: I think the only real effect it has is that the game will affect the leaderboard less
 MSmits: and with less opponents you are more likely to get some quests done (win x in a row)
 jacek: premature coc starting?
 L_Dawgy_Dawg: Clash of Code! :grimacing:
 LoukasPap: hey
 Enknable: Is there any docs on "Unlocked Certifications"
 NoisyBoy: does the C# language assist crash for anyone else
 NoisyBoy: it's been broken for 2-3 days now
 AbundantPuddle: I don't typically code in C#, but I can check it out. How does it crash?
 NoisyBoy: just says "Activating C# Language Assist"
 NoisyBoy: but it never does
 NoisyBoy: i am coding without intellisense
 AbundantPuddle: Are you using a custom IDE or the one in the browser?
 NoisyBoy: in the browser
 NoisyBoy: firefox
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my lang. crashes assist and restarts paused all the time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I wanna turn it off completely, the stupid popup boxes interfere when I'm cutting and pasting
 NoisyBoy: it is helpful. but crashes too frequently
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, it looks like the C# Language Assist is having some trouble right now.
 NoisyBoy:&#160;:(
 AbundantPuddle: I believe it is most likely server side and there's not much we can do besides report it.
 AbundantPuddle: It seems Rust was experiencing the same issue. A report was made a few days ago.

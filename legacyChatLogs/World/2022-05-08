 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 61 taco. jacek now has 29 taco
 Automaton2000: but that was a bad idea
 Automaton2000: i am the only one
 Quidome: good morning
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Quidome, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 17 tacos
 Quidome: another taco&#160;:)
 Space-Gamer: h
 chamar: Pretty new to platform, its soo confusing ...... 
 chamar: Variables and inputs are messed up
 tims_keyboard: thanks for the taco
 tims_keyboard: oh no its not for me
 tims_keyboard: wheres my taco
 tims_keyboard: TACOO????
 5DN1L: hi antiwonto hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it doesn't show up for me
 5DN1L: chamar are you still confused?
 Pauloux: Anyone know how to make a report of a bug to the boss of codingame or something like that&#160;?
 5DN1L: what bug?
 Pauloux: It doesn't validate my gold league in the last challenge as a bronze league for the missions
 5DN1L: validate? mission? which page/game are you talking about?
 Pauloux: the main page with the graph with the mission
 5DN1L: do you mean the quest map?
 Pauloux: in the AI part, you need to make it to bronze league in two bot combats
 Pauloux: Yes
 5DN1L: ok, let me see
 5DN1L: so you're talking about REACH BRONZE LEAGUE IN 2 GAMES, right?
 Pauloux: Yes
 5DN1L: Hmmm, I don't know if they count contests or not, and I don't know if they count after the bot is transferred from contest to normal game
 5DN1L: I think you can post your question on Discord, in #bug-report channel
 Pauloux: OK thank you very much
 5DN1L: np
 Pauloux: I made the change you said to my contribution btw, thank you again
 5DN1L: np
 5DN1L: please mention quest map and REACH BRONZE LEAGUE IN 2 GAMES in your post on Discord
 5DN1L: otherwise they may not understand what your question is

 programmerForLife007: hello my aim is to build AGI and if not then contribute towards it .
 programmerForLife007: basically pull singularity closer
 DomiKo: taco
 jacek: is Automaton2000 closer to singularity
 Automaton2000: i think it's not worth it to do
 programmerForLife007: i dont see singularity

 Quidome: hi there
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Quidome, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 18 tacos
 Quidome: struct nice! excellent use case for NN
 Quidome: or RL
 Quidome: or both :D
 struct: hi
 jacek: what makes you think that
 StevenV: hello gúy
 StevenV: hi there
 struct: I think depth 1 eval can do well here jacek
 StevenV: exit the Earth
 struct: But I might be wrong, maybe Quidome knows other reason
 Quidome: well the first world class backgammon program used this
 Quidome: I think it is in the Barto book on RL let me check
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: do you guys think its better trying to build the algorithm first, or to just look up the design pattern for the algorithm and try to apply it to the probjem
 Quidome: which algo?
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: binary search.. having a hard time implementing  a 2-dimensional one. I can do it but maybe need another 2h.. meanwhile if i just look up design pattern, probably a 20 min job..
 Quidome: find it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon</a>
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: already spent a few hours messing around with different options before settling down 
 jacek: of course im trolling with ya <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/User:Gerald_Tesauro/Proposed/Td-gammon">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/User:Gerald_Tesauro/Proposed/Td-gammon</a>
 Quidome: hm, yes, i remember that one found it tricky too
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i see the completion rate is much lower for it than other problems
 struct: should I make 1st player (based on cg) always go first?
 Quidome: I think you can split the search into two dimnesions
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: glad im not only one. i'm getting ready for interview so trying to balance time on one problem, vs just cramming several different algorithms in short period of time..
 struct: or do I roll dices like on normal backgammon to choose?
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: that's what i decided to go with
 jacek: BigBadStopwatch_4678 is it dark knight problem?
 struct: I think it makes more sense to be CG choosing
 StevenV: hello antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] hey StevenV. I'm a bot :robot:
 jacek: does it matter much?
 jacek: its not like it needs pie rule
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: sometimes i try to make the code clean which maybe slows me down too much. I probably should just code dirty and quick, then look for consolidation options after
 struct: idk
 struct: I dont play the game
 struct: Is just that you could have less games as p1 with bad rng I guess
 jacek: well, my code on CG always look hackatonish. i first make something that works, then later try to improve it
 StevenV: hello guys, is "Featured Puzzle" was "Puzzle of week" before?
 jacek: yes, they replaced it
 Quidome: The player that goes first has about a 51.327% chance of winning. The player that goes second has about a 48.673% chance of winning.
 Quidome: even with a bad RNG it doesn't matter much
 StevenV: thanks
 struct: that is in computers playing eachother Quidome?

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Quidome, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 19 tacos
 Quidome: I get a lot of tacos when nobody is talking :D
 Quidome: struct can you double as well in your backgammon implementation?
 struct: yes
 Quidome: but... are you playing a match then, otherwise you always accept
 struct: wdym?
 Quidome: doubling is a way of forcing the opponent out of the game
 Quidome: but if there is only one game, there is not point in tit\
 Quidome: it
 struct: ah I thought you meant double dices
 Quidome: yes I do
 struct: When you get same number you play 4 times
 Quidome: aha wait
 Quidome: i see
 Quidome: yes of course you do double dices, but there is this extra dice wit 2, 4, 8, 16 on it
 struct: ah no
 struct: I dont have that
 Quidome: good
 Quidome: makes no sense in this case but when you play a match then it does
 struct: I saw that on some version I played but I didnt like it
 struct: if its just 1 match yeah
 Quidome: normally you play a match, first player with 13 points wins the match
 struct: it needs to be multiple games for that extra dice to work
 Quidome: precisely
 struct: I dont think many games would fit cg 
 struct: I would probably run out of turns
 struct: I have a limit of 600 turns total
 Quidome: you can play first to 5 points
 Quidome: whats the average game length?
 struct: I honestly dont know
 struct: But if i see its short I could add more matches
 Quidome: Average Number of Moves in a Game
 struct: I guess 1 move = 1 player turn
 struct: until he has done all the moves
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+712">https://bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+712</a>
 Quidome: 13 point match would be to much indeed, but 5 point match would work
 struct: But without the double dice right?
 struct: the 1,2,4,...
 Quidome: hm, best of 7 will work as well
 Quidome: that means a 5 point match will not work
 Quidome: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 as high as you want it to go, but again no point to go higher then 8 in a 5 point match
 Quidome: don't no if you should do it btw
 Quidome: was just curious, it adds a lot of complexity for the AI
 struct: yeah
 struct: maybe 1 point with multiple
 struct: games
 Quidome: no need for that then
 Quidome: so plain 1 point game
 Quidome: only
 Quidome: Nice you are building that :punch:
 Quidome: When do you expect it for testing?
 struct: today/tomrrow
 Quidome: NICE
 struct: this time I wont give number of legal actions per turn because its way harder to calculate it
 struct: Because im expecting the player to output the moves for the dices rolled all at once
 Quidome: make sense, the number of legal moves is dependent on the dice roll indeed
 struct: yeah and the first move affects the next number of actions
 jacek: i dont understand (i havent played that game)
 jacek: i thought i get the dices numbers and output moves
 struct: yes
 jacek: what else is there
 struct: not much
 bot021: hola soy robot 
 struct: But you output the first move
 struct: the second moves are different now
 struct: Because you can move the same piece multiple times
 bot021: hola mundo
 struct: hi
 EnitSuj: Hello, I am not a pro at programming in C and I have a question during clash of codes:When I declare a variable x for exemple, inside 'for' loops it says that x is undeclared
 bot021: hi
 jacek: so you have multiple moves one dependent on the other
 jacek: EnitSuj can you write the code
 EnitSuj: I don't have the code but it is something like&#160;:char names[31];
 EnitSuj: for(int i  ---------------){___for(int j; names[k]&#160;!= '\0'; k++){
 EnitSuj: int j; names[j]; j++****
 jacek: hm
 struct: well its just a warning
 struct: since you dont assign a value to it
 struct: it will probably have a random value that was in memory
 Minnie99: hi guys.. can u tell me the best way to learn coding in java? I am in wood league rank 2 and I just don't know basic thing like write distance , angle and speed.. i am trying for hours , it's insane. 
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://exercism.org/tracks">https://exercism.org/tracks</a>
 Quidome: and 
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://open.kattis.com/">https://open.kattis.com/</a>
 Quidome: 1.1 and 1.2 difficulty only
 Minnie99: i will try, thanks 
 Quidome: the first move is a matter of definition you mean you have 2 moves in one turn?
 Quidome: You could think of  a move as the combination of the two and then that problem is gone but...
 Quidome: you still have the dive dependency so yes no list with legal moves supplied by the referee
 Quidome: dive -&gt; dice
 Wontonimo: hey Minnie99, what game&#160;?
 Wontonimo: are you doing mad pod racing or spider attack&#160;?
 Quidome: Wontonimo do you think this is the right website for learning Java?
 Wontonimo: 100% no.  This is for after you've learnt the basics and want to level up
 Wontonimo: and challenge yourself to something more than listing all even numbers from 1 to 100
 Quidome: oh ok, i was sending him/her of  to a better place but wasn't sure you want to work with him/her
 Wontonimo: i'd still be happy to help
 Wontonimo: that link you sent to exercism is gold!
 Quidome: yes indeed and when I need to switch languages in my head I solve a few Kattis problems :D
 Quidome: Even the easy problems on this site are getting more diificult\
 Quidome: the they were used to be
 Wontonimo: I think this site requires the basics&#160;: variables, loops, functions, arrays, and outside of those programming things it is really hard to do much here without knowledge of basic algebra
 Wontonimo: yeah, I'd like the Easy problems to be easy and they are not.
 Wontonimo: or have a 'Clash' level of puzzles below Easy, called Intro
 Quidome: That would be an idea, to have a intro level problem set. Doesn't have to change like the rest of the content
 struct: at least math is not needed for some multis
 waterproofsodium: hey why don't I rank up when winning in clash?
 waterproofsodium: my score didn't change for 2 days

 Napolitana: I am new here and don't know what I'm doing :sweat_smile: any tips on where to start learning?
 Darleanow: hello every1&#160;:)
 Darleanow: depends on your level in coding&#160;!!
 Darleanow: you should go ahead and do some puzzles
 Darleanow: you should also do some clash of code
 xmetrix: @Irina .. maybe just clash!
 jacek: clash is too stressful
 ZndrBrok: Puzzles are good to start or maybe u can try the IA games (MadPodRacing for exemple is like poker, easy to start but not so easy if u want to have a good code :P)  
 ZndrBrok: Clashes depend of your level, if you just start it can be frustrating to have a timer.
 Ayza: honestly "easy" puzzles here are not as easy as they sound, but they are good
 Ayza: aka you don't do it as a beginner
 Ayza: clashes are probably the best to go for first
 monkeyman2000: siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
 VirtualRealityRocks: if you want an easy puzzle do "the descent" or whatever it's called, so easy
 Ayza: yea the default puzzles or whatever they are called are just as the difficulty states
 Ayza: but community puzzles may be the hard ones
 Ayza: The thor one is pretty easy as well
 VirtualRealityRocks: and temperatures
 waterproofsodium: uh delayed "ty" for the explanations on my question @ 5DN1L @ struct

 waterproofsodium: don't get discouraged tho
 waterproofsodium:&#160;:/
 FantomOldWenis: thank you, how long have you been at it?
 waterproofsodium: couple of years (although not on this site)
 FantomOldWenis: what would recommend working towards as a beginner goal? (aside from 'Hello, World!'
 Ayza: do you mean as in puzzles?
 FantomOldWenis: yeah, cause i tried to do the clash arena whatever but i didnt really know where to start
 Ayza: I would suggest getting in grasp of the beginner programming concepts first
 Ayza: and try this site <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hackerrank.com">https://hackerrank.com</a>
 FantomOldWenis: what for?
 Ayza: that site has puzzles fitting for beginners which you probably won't find here, so once you've gotten decent at it you can try clashes here
 FantomOldWenis: about that
 FantomOldWenis: im 16 and dont have a school thats in the registry it keeps on sending me to 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: did a hackerrank based interview, didnt get the job lol
 Ayza: don't sign an as a company, I think there should be a developer one or something
 Ayza: pick that one
 struct: placeholder graphics are done just need to parse inputs now
 waterproofsodium: wtf
 waterproofsodium: i did 100% and got 75%!!!
 struct: test cases are different from validators
 waterproofsodium: ah
 waterproofsodium: what does that mean? :P
 waterproofsodium: I had to wait longer?
 Ayza: test cases are just to test your code
 Ayza: validators are the real deal
 Ayza: hidden test cases you could say
 Ayza: so you don't try to hardcode
 waterproofsodium: uh hu
 waterproofsodium: which is what I did
 waterproofsodium: because that problem kinda said "hardcode me"
 FantomOldWenis: what does hardcode mean/
 FantomOldWenis:&#160;?*
 waterproofsodium: "write literally"
 waterproofsodium: = not abstracting the problem and finding a solution
 FantomOldWenis: ohhhhhhh, sounds counterproductive lmao

 FantomOldWenis: oh..... thanks :joy::sweat:
 struct: Does it make sense?
 FantomOldWenis: yeahhh, though im not quite sure why there are empty quotes if i was to be honest
 struct: a space
 struct: you need to print x y and thrust
 struct: each one separated by a space
 FantomOldWenis: ohhhhhhh
 struct: or the referee wont be able to understand it
 FantomOldWenis: i forget how to replace something 
 FantomOldWenis: like im trying to replace thrust with boost if it meets the requirements
 struct: you can do thrust = "BOOST"
 struct: since its python
 struct: it should owrk
 waterproofsodium: why are there so many people around that are better than me with greater rank
 waterproofsodium: I'm iritated xD
 struct: and if you print boost without having it will just print 100 instead
 waterproofsodium: aha! they do only clash&#160;!!

 Lobster_Speed: yoou can start with simple tutorial
 Lobster_Speed: then keep practiciing from there 
 Almasss: no one does
 jacek: merry Caturday's eve
 eulerscheZahl: it's still in the morning
 jacek: oh
 jrke: merry christmas
 YodaMaster123: Merry Christmas
 praWIN: HI all, Happy Christmas... 
 praWIN: new to codin game
 praWIN: Interesting&#160;;)
 AlexandruBecher: Hello boys &amp; girls.
 zhoubou: Merry Christmas&#160;:)
 zhoubou: What's a community puzzle? How do I find them?
 JBM: in the puzzles section
 JBM: first tab
 zhoubou: There are only "Best suggestions" and tiered puzzles "Classic puzzle - easy", then medium, so on
 zhoubou: And sponsored puzzles
 jacek: and puzzle of the week
 zhoubou: I don't see that
 zhoubou: I'm on practice tab. Should I be somewhere else?
 jacek: community puzzles are just made by people, not cg staff themselves
 jacek: and they are in easy, medium etc. sections as well
 zhoubou: Ah, I see.
 zhoubou: How do I differentiate?
 zhoubou: Oh, is it the profile pictures?
 jacek: names
 jacek: yes, profile pictures
 zhoubou: Ahh I see, thank you!
 jacek: AutomatoNN merry christmas
 jacek: AutomatonNN even
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a simple game in the contest company participate in the submit t
 jacek: phew
 jrke: AutomatoNN who is jrke?
 YodaMaster123: Misspelled it
 jrke: AutomatonNN who is jrke?
 AutomatonNN: can anyone explain why to think of it&#160;?
 jrke: AutomatonNN who is magus?
 AutomatonNN: what is the most recent reason why it does not work
 zhoubou: Is AutomatonNN a bot?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is the Game of the Coding game on CodinGame contest to get some sleep to the team (bec

 MSmits: hehe AutomatonNN talks about euler and sleep because we talk often about eulers early bedtime :P
 AutomatonNN: good morning
 MSmits: good morning AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code on CG :P
 PetrSp: Merry Christmas
 Alexandru_Becher: Merry Christmas!
 eulerscheZahl: can i just ban that bot?
 Maxim251: I dont know if i can share with code from ocean of code, but i have some issue  with planning how ewerything grouped, it become in one point a mess. Now i have problems with adding stuff to improve code.

 Maxim251: Ps. Marru Christmas to all.
 MSmits: aww eulerscheZahl, he just wants to be like you
 MSmits: you're his idol
 Maxim251: Do can somebody say what You think about my code?
 YodaMaster123: ask AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: when to start with your submit in every language though
 Astrobytes: good afternoon
 YodaMaster123: Hi
 AFUFAFU: MERRY XMAS&#160;!!
 YodaMaster123: Very surprising, python3 bot at the top of GitC
 AntiSquid: oh random promotion to gold in fall challenge :omerry christmas Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: old enough to have a look at the wrong time
 AntiSquid: you're saying it's wrong to check cg on xmas? but they sent me the mail Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: thought you were talking about that
 YodaMaster123:  Someone would have pushed you :P like I often do when I`m at the top of a league...
 AntiSquid: i know, just random rambling YodaMaster123
 YodaMaster123:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: merry christmas
 YodaMaster123: Merry Christmas
 Astrobytes: bah, humbug
 AntiSquid: it must have been santa playing the fall challenge duh
 YodaMaster123: :p
 AntiSquid: christmas push!
 YodaMaster123: Euler 2nd now :o?
 AntiSquid: anyone seen this btw? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules">https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules</a>
 CoderDJD: Yes @AntiSquid.
 jacek: slowpoke
 jacek: at least the paper
 inoryy: not slowpoke, paper was just published in nature. you've likely seen the pre-print
 jacek: whats the difference
 inoryy: it's evolved quite a bit since. Reanalyze is a new addition for example.
 Astrobytes: oh hey inoryy
 inoryy: hello
 jacek: so sci-hub it is. yaar
 AntiSquid: i saw it on the day it was published, but only linked it here today since i only visited site today jacek @_@ fix your xmas trolling, it's not enough
 Westicles: They should move on to solving pork belly futures
 jacek: or bioengineering cat girls
 AntiSquid: what do you mean? pork belly recipes&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: i hope they won't be as weird and pretentious as on masterchef
 Westicles: Stock market
 Westicles: or cat girls, that's okay too
 AntiSquid: there was video on "two minute papers" about tax optimization, that would be a cool project imo
 AntiSquid: and inoryy do you get pinged when someone talks about deepmind related stuff? merry xmas
 jacek: deepmind
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: openAI is my favorite
 MSmits: two minute papers is weird
 MSmits: is that a person reading, or an automated voice?
 AntiSquid: a person presenting
 jacek: it's ai
 MSmits: the content is interesting, but I would suggest that if that is a real person, they get a machine to read it instead
 AntiSquid: woah hating the accent or what? :P which video were you watching
 MSmits: i got annoyed within 20 seconds of listening
 MSmits: no not the accent
 MSmits: i dont mind that
 MSmits: it's the tone
 MSmits: the pitch i should say
 MSmits: not sure how to explain
 MSmits: it's really weird
 AntiSquid: it's hungarian pitch 
 AntiSquid: that's how they talk
 MSmits: mmh no it's not based on any country i think, i doubt that
 MSmits: it's really repetitive
 MSmits: noone talks like that 
 MSmits: if they do, they're an exception in their own country
 jacek: what video
 AntiSquid: i am wondering if we were watching same video
 AntiSquid: but finnish and hungarians have same weird pitch
 MSmits: I think we're not AntiSquid
 MSmits: let me find one
 AntiSquid: i imagine now MSmits giving hungarian tourists weird stares
 Westicles: finnish guys make the weirdest noise when you walk in their bike paths
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0fMwA3X5KI&amp;list=PLujxSBD-JXgnqDD1n-V30pKtp6Q886x7e">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0fMwA3X5KI&amp;list=PLujxSBD-JXgnqDD1n-V30pKtp6Q886x7e</a>
 MSmits: it's Indian, but the accent doesnt bother me
 MSmits: it's the way he talks
 AntiSquid: that's him, 
 MSmits: it's like he's continuing summing things up or something
 MSmits: the same flow in every sentence
 AntiSquid: i can't notice anything weird
 MSmits: impossible ot listen to 
 Westicles: every syllable is stressed
 inoryy: AntiSquid nope, just a concidence -- came online for the first time in months I think
 MSmits: Westicles maybe thats it yeah
 AntiSquid: MSmits what about this then <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/7yh9i0PAjck?t=19">https://youtu.be/7yh9i0PAjck?t=19</a>
 MSmits: thats fine

 AntiSquid: had hungarians in my hometown so i can't hear anything weird in his videos&#160;:/
 jacek: and this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8</a>
 MSmits: brings back memories jacek&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: that's skynet generated obv
 MSmits: I actually considered showing some of those two-papers videos in my class because of the amazing content. I love the one where they just remove stuff from videos and its undetectable
 MSmits: but I'm afraid the reaction of my student to the guy talking will be worse than mine. It usually is
 MSmits: they're 16-18 yrs old after all, far more immature than me, most of them :P
 Astrobytes: I like those videos, narrator doesn't bother me
 MSmits: might be a personal thing 
 AntiSquid: a vendetta 
 MSmits: no no, i am sure he is a great guy
 MSmits: it's just the way every sentence has to end with the pitch going up, stressing the syllable as Westicles said
 AntiSquid: let's invite him to CG to beat smits in next contest
 MSmits: there's enough people beating me at contests :P
 Astrobytes: Voiceism! Narratorism!
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: and he will make a video of his postmortem instead of writing it
 MSmits: good one
 cazka: hi
 AntiSquid: greetings
 struct: Hello
 Astrobytes: Salutations.
 eulerscheZahl: moin

 eulerscheZahl: what are you working on?
 struct: Still stc
 eulerscheZahl: oh, somehow i thought you are creating your own game once again
 struct: I made stc referee in c++
 struct: I want to finish stc first, it waited long enough
 struct: And there seems to be a lot of multies pending at the moment
 jacek: meow
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you understand this
 Automaton2000: do you use any kind of search do you mean?
 jacek: Automaton2000 i just average
 Automaton2000: best way to read the inputs
 jacek: :punch:
 jrke: Automaton2000 who is jrke?
 Automaton2000: i can make a lot of time to get back to it
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes did you find a new movement order for 2048?
 Astrobytes: not recently?
 eulerscheZahl: then i remembered your score wrong, ignore me
 Astrobytes: it was a month or so ago I think
 eulerscheZahl: CG shows submit times for bots but not optim&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a little infuriating
 Astrobytes: Lies. It was 3 months ago. My bad
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/genome-sequencing">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/genome-sequencing</a> ... this was the easiest hard puzzle ever.  dynamic programming? divide and conquer? for N&lt;6?
 mzbear: "handle a large number of possible combinations and permutations. You need to use optimized algorithm techniques like dynamic programming and more specifically divide and conquer"
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-resistance">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-resistance</a>easiest very hard
 mzbear: wtf. that has the same blurb!
 mzbear: but yeah, i had much more trouble with Djoum's recent "medium" inversion count puzzle than that very hard one
 eulerscheZahl: try nintendo. that deserves the very hard
 mzbear: (i was probably doing the inversion count wrong way and there's some clever trick that eluded me)
 mzbear: i have checked out the nintendo, and i actually spent some time yesterday planning for how to solve it
 eulerscheZahl: didn't try the inversions. i would sort the list and then compare actual and expected spot
 mzbear: but that's not how it's defined&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: sum of those differences = solution
 eulerscheZahl: and sort is fast enough
 Astrobytes: But it's easy:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/nintendo-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/nintendo-sponsored-contest</a>
 mzbear: euler, the sorted position doesn't help because the puzzle defines the inversion count as the sum of the count of succeeding elements lower than each element
 Westicles: Inversion is just another look-up-the-algorithm puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/parsing-context-free-grammar">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/parsing-context-free-grammar</a>
 mzbear: and how do you look it up until someone has ... oh, i see, this puzzle has already been published elsewhere before
 eulerscheZahl: which even tells you what algo to use
 mzbear: heh
 Astrobytes: Not that I mind it too much, but when the algorithm is suggested to you it should be in a separate 'learning' section, as it's less of a puzzle and more of an exercise
 Astrobytes: (just thinking out loud)
 Westicles: Opinions vary.  I got two downvotes on my pi puzzle specifically because I didn't explain the algorithm
 Westicles: *rejects
 mzbear: hardly anyone can come up with an algorithm for efficiently calculating arbitrary digits of pi, not in a reasonable time anyway
 eulerscheZahl: finding the right algo usually is the fun part of a puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: implementing it is the tedious part to prove you found the algo
 Westicles: They say you shouldn't have to leave the site to solve
 mzbear: i got reasonably far in drafting an algorithm for the nintendo challenge before someone blurted out a buzzword for it in the chat which made it much more obvious what i was looking at :P
 Westicles: GF?
 mzbear: yep
 Westicles: And then there is this.  I don't know who the audience could possible be for something so niche
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BUnm-bnik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BUnm-bnik</a>
 Astrobytes: that may have been me who mentioned the GF, but it's not the whole problem
 mzbear: i'm still kinda tempted to try to implement my own algorithm for the nintendo challenge.  it just got a tad bit more daunting after i realized the goal :D
 Astrobytes: oh that guy, even paid a mathematics professor to help him
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk</a>
 Maxim251: how to not teaching C
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1fISh-pag&amp;ab_channel=AlbertVeli">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1fISh-pag&amp;ab_channel=AlbertVeli</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, I knew that was incoming
 eulerscheZahl: me too :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's like linking bobby tables
 Astrobytes: haha yes, indeed
 mzbear: way too many people write c++ as if it was glorified c, though... sometimes i fall down in that pit as well, when the C approach feels easier to write than the c++ one
 Astrobytes: I do it on CG tbh
 eulerscheZahl: is there even that one C++?
 mzbear: btw, is there a compilation time limit for bots on CG?
 Astrobytes: my RAIC code however is fully compliant modern C++
 eulerscheZahl: with the new standards (starting at c++11)
 eulerscheZahl: yes mzbear. i think it's around 20s
 eulerscheZahl: a little more for clojure
 Astrobytes: "is there even that one C++" -&#160;?
 mzbear: i'm wondering if it would be possible to use metaprogramming to make the compiler calculate an opening book during compile time...
 Astrobytes: hahaha clever thinking
 mzbear: well, it doesn't even need to be template hell in modern c++, thanks to constexpr
 eulerscheZahl: just saying that the C++ approach can look very different depending on the version you are using
 Astrobytes: true mzbear
 mzbear: pre-c++11 is indeed very different ... and post-c++20 will again be very different
 Astrobytes: yes, 'modern c++' is C++11 on wards, totally different beasts
 mzbear: ranges will completely change the game
 Astrobytes: C++20 looks intriguing
 Astrobytes: IT's actually 
 Astrobytes: *supported in RAIC but I'm not using it 
 mzbear: a lot of modernization was cut short because they didn't think a pair of iterators was a good way to represent ranges after all
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC is bleeding edge
 mzbear: (or, rather, there was no guarantee that a pair of iterators was a range)
 eulerscheZahl: Java15, C#9
 Astrobytes: yes, that's a good point mzbear
 mzbear: check out this, for example:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/tcbrindle/NanoRange">https://github.com/tcbrindle/NanoRange</a>
 mzbear: scroll down the readme for some code example
 mzbear: a glimpse of the future&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Beautiful!
 eulerscheZahl: C++ just looks more and more cryptic to me&#160;:(
 jacek: time for rust
 mzbear: c++20 Concepts will make c++ a lot easier to work with, though, since it will tremendously improve error message quality
 Astrobytes: ^
 mzbear: imagine only getting one error message instead of hundred when you do something wrong? can you even call it c++ anymore? ;D
 eulerscheZahl: that completely ruins the debugging experience
 Astrobytes: I'm sure we'll all find enough ways to generate 10 page long cryptic error messages to keep us feeling warm and fuzzy inside
 jacek: why i cant invite any of you to clash&#160;:(
 MSmits: I don't know about you but I'm looking at error messages right now
 MSmits: so relaxing
 MSmits: nah just kidding, i just fixed my last stack overflow and my nim calculator is working&#160;:)
 MSmits: slow as hell, time for some hashtables
 struct: Do you write your own hashtable or you use std::map/unordered?
 jacek: the worst errors are in std, when you try i.e. push something weird in vector or sort using wrong lambda and you get pages of irrelelvant errors 
 MSmits: i started using my own, but only when i dont have to care about collisions
 MSmits: I just accept losing some values on collision, having to recalculate
 MSmits: it's annoying when you have to have entries with linked lists or whatnot to have multiple values with the same hash
 MSmits: jacek ive found the worst errors are those that only show up when you turn on optimization
 MSmits: that somehow the non-optimized c++ fixes your bug
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: but when you have optimizations on, there is hardly any error information
 MSmits: so...
 jacek: dupa debugging it is, then
 Astrobytes: You should also spend some time understanding what the optimisations do
 MSmits: thats why it's annoying, you have to do that just to fix your bug :P
 Astrobytes: and whether it's beneficial for the bot in question
 MSmits: meh, i want my bot to be fast without any effort&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: this nim calculator is 400-500 lines
 MSmits: it's going in my bot when i am done
 MSmits: putting me to nearly 3k
 MSmits: Remi is going down
 MSmits: (I hope)
 struct: whats a nim calculator?
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: Nim theory is a mathematical theory where the last person to move loses
 MSmits: or wins, i forgot
 jacek: sounds zugzwangy
 MSmits: in Dots and boxes this is generally also true with 7x7. The person who has to move into a nonsafe square because no other option is left, loses
 MSmits: it is very 
 MSmits: it's the definition of zugzwang i guess
 MSmits: Remi uses nim theory i think
 MSmits: he's a mathematician
 MSmits: so he knows it
 MSmits: and he always has the last chains
 struct: ah ok
 jacek: mathematicians :unamused:
 MSmits: my calculator calculates nim values. The earlier i can do this, the more chances i have to steer the game such that I dont have to open the first long chain
 MSmits: thats why it's gotta be fast and why i need the hash tables
 struct: yeah, seems similar to zugzwang
 eulerscheZahl: what a nice german word
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.chzbgr.com/full/5895340800/h39668730/schmetterlinggggg">https://i.chzbgr.com/full/5895340800/h39668730/schmetterlinggggg</a>
 MSmits: vlinder&#160;:)
 struct: borboleta
 Astrobytes: I quite like schmetterling tbh
 Astrobytes: It's dealan-d√® in Scots Gaelic
 MSmits: the name would make more sense if it hit your windshield at 100 kph
 jacek: reminded me of 
 jacek: tuatha de danann
 MSmits: it sounds like splatterling
 Astrobytes: that's Irish jacek
 jacek: whats the difference
 Astrobytes: One Gaelic is Scottish, one is Irish :P
 Astrobytes: They are quite different languages, although related
 Astrobytes: I can't speak more than a few words of either tbh, which is a shame
 Astrobytes: The Welsh Gaelic has more in common with Breton
 Astrobytes: And I think you can (always?) tell if you're dealing with Irish or Scots by looking at the accents
 Astrobytes: √© or √® for example
 jacek: how can you 'look' at the accent?
 jacek: oh
 Astrobytes: Not sure if it's 100% reliable but that's about all I know
 Astrobytes: I'm a lowlander, not a highlander or islander
 Westicles: The scots accents go widdershins
 MSmits: widdershins?
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: that sounds hobbit
 Astrobytes: anticlockwise
 MSmits: widdershins sounds better
 MSmits: let me guess, clockwise is antiwiddershins&#160;?
 Westicles: deasil
 MSmits: now you're just making stuff up
 Astrobytes: sunwise more common
 MSmits: they must have been great astronomers to know which way the sun rotates
 Astrobytes: but you don't often hear it used 
 Astrobytes: Older generations and those who grew up around them are more likely to use widdershins
 Astrobytes: You can use it like 'going against the normal'
 MSmits: like "he's going widdershins again!"
 Astrobytes: If something's round the wrong way you can say it's gone widdershins 
 Westicles: I am also fond of cattywampus
 Astrobytes: not commonly but I guess you could say that MSmits
 MSmits: then I will
 MSmits: I'm widdershins like that
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: cattywampus, that has a nice sound to it
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: oh widdershins is like widersinnig
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl will like that
 MSmits: seems like it works. I tested the offline calculator against Remi on a lost game. If I had made a different move 5 plies back, i would have won. That means it's not like he has the game won very far before the endgame. He just fixes it to win right before
 MSmits: so whatever he did the first 50 plies doesnt even matter, including the boxes he gives away
 MSmits: it's the 5 plies after that where he just puts his line correctly and then grabs all the chains
 MSmits: whereas everyone else has no clue how to play in those turns
 MSmits: now to get this calculator into my bot... sigh. another big merge operation
 Astrobytes: well, that sounds promising and worth the effort at least.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's really cool that we have a game that's so math heavy
 MSmits: i did more research on this than on other games combined
 MSmits: brute force is pointless here and so are all the searches, if you dont use the math
 jacek: math&#160;:(
 MSmits: says the guy who has the best machine learning bots (for board games at least)
 jacek: its mostly trial and error
 MSmits: you dont know how your own math works?
 jacek: it works so i dont care
 MSmits: not saying you should care, but usually when you dont get it, its hard to get it to work
 jacek: i have some basics of course. but until i wrote NN from scratch theory was useless
 MSmits: right, so practice before theory
 MSmits: some people learn better that way, doesnt mean you're not good at the math
 MSmits: you just pick it up a different way
 jacek: i use derivative for learning, but aside from programming once that derivative function which i just copied from somewhere else, i dont use derivative (theory)
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: btw, i am no math guru,  I dont understand most of the fancy notation, but I get the concepts and can code them with some effort
 jacek: so do i
 MSmits: or at least, i sometimes momentarily understand the notation but then quickly forget
 MSmits: because symbols dont interest me
 jacek: i read paper with so many math symbols and i dont get it until i write the code
 Astrobytes: you have to keep working with them or it goes straight out your head again in my experience
 DJSchaffner: can you change the template code for languages?
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah thats it
 MSmits: DJSchaffner you can completely redo the code yeah
 MSmits: but dont delete it all at once, it helps you read the input correctly
 DJSchaffner: i meant like "prehand" so i dont have to do it in every puzzle/challenge/..
 MSmits: not really, as the input is different for every challenge
 MSmits: also, there's not that much code is it?
 MSmits: if i do a multi arena which i will spend weeks on, i dont mind spending half an hour to get the input reading in my style
 DJSchaffner: alright. no i just wanted to remove the comments
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: so it's basically a minor annoyance
 DJSchaffner: yes
 DJSchaffner: nothing major
 MSmits: i feel the same, but I accepted it
 DJSchaffner: looks like i will have to accept it too then :D
 MSmits: yep&#160;:)
 MSmits: what are you doing btw
 MSmits: puzzle or arena, or clash&#160;?
 DJSchaffner: i just did my first clash. other than that i have only done puzzles so far
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: ahh ok. I dont know how good of a coder you are, but the most fun is in the arenas. Multiplayer and optimization
 MSmits: usually larger programs there, 100+ lines 
 Astrobytes: Helpful Jacek strikes again
 MSmits: he's so widdershins
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 DJSchaffner: i'd consider myself a decent programmer. i find my way around things :D
 MSmits: then you should have no  problem
 DJSchaffner: but theres always things to learn
 MSmits: it's nice to have something competitive that you can work on for longer than 15 mins
 DJSchaffner: thats true
 MSmits: ohh you're a professional coder even
 MSmits: judging from your profile
 DJSchaffner: where do i find the multiplayer section you mentioned?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/</a>
 VizGhar: Hey guys... I'm used to write C code (beside my primary lang. Kotlin), but not much of C++. What should I learn - language specific - so that I'll be not that far behind in competitions?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization</a>
 MSmits: those two are the most fun imho
 MSmits: much to choose from, take a while to look at them all
 Westicles: Department Informatik... that sounds like something from a Kraftwerk song
 DJSchaffner: ah got it. though it was a seperate category but its "compete" then :D 
 MSmits: yeah
 VizGhar: bot programming is cornerstone&#160;:)
 jacek: VizGhar i dont use fancy c++ specific thing. i dont even know how to write template
 MSmits: VizGhar i can barely code C++, yet i do very well
 MSmits: same as jacek, i cant do a template
 VizGhar: OK&#160;:) so I assume I'm about your level guys :D
 MSmits: i often have duplicate code and i know there is some way to combine it using templates or whatnot, but i dont want to bother
 DJSchaffner: haha not really professional no. just a student but i quit my first "study (?)"
 jacek: oO
 VizGhar: busy life DJSchaffner&#160;?
 MSmits: VizGhar I think C++ knowledge is a little more required for those complicated multis where you'll make lots of classes and derivative classes
 MSmits: the simple boardgames require almost 0 knowledge, as long as you know how pointers and references and such work
 VizGhar: love pointers actually&#160;:)
 MSmits: good, you'll be fine then

 MSmits: in shortest mode yes
 VizGhar: If I need classes or some complicated structures, I'd use kotlin most probably. But looking at UTTT for example, I have to be in touch with C/C++
 jacek: in shortest mode?
 alenic: hi, someone knows the maximum file size in bytes of an optimization problem&#160;?
 jacek: 100k characters
 alenic: thank you
 MSmits: yea, there is no bytes limit, its characters
 DJSchaffner: is there a mode selection for it? i didnt see any
 jacek: its random
 MSmits: of 3
 DJSchaffner: ahhh that makes sense
 Astrobytes: lol Westicles
 Astrobytes: oh, chat scroll, was fetching some wine
 DJSchaffner: i felt so under pressure to get doen quickly i didnt have the time to read everything and couldnt read it again after it was done haha
 MSmits: shortest is the only one where time doesnt matter as long as its under 15 mi
 MSmits: +n
 MSmits: except maybe if you're tied on length
 MSmits: seems rare
 VizGhar: The clash mode pops up right on clash start. Or in top left corner during clash. Try to read everything from the beginning
 DJSchaffner: that would explain why the guy that got first in the ranking was above someone who finished much earlier
 VizGhar: Or check the introduction video
 struct: if you want to win you cant read
 MSmits: you can read for shortest
 VizGhar: sure :P But if you want to learn you should
 DJSchaffner: i only skipped through the intro video but maybe should have paid more attention :D
 jacek: intro video? oO
 DJSchaffner: what are you guys mainly doing here?
 jacek: multiplayer games
 VizGhar: mutliplayer games and puzzles maybe
 DJSchaffner: mostly about training or just for fun?
 VizGhar: achievements :D
 Astrobytes: Fun with learning along the way
 MSmits: yeah
 DJSchaffner: cool
 MSmits: also there's competition
 MSmits: its not just fun
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: it's winning :grin:
 MSmits: and sometimes losing&#160;:(
 DJSchaffner: :joy:
 Astrobytes: And of course our most excellent, helpful community. 
 Astrobytes: And jacek :P
 MSmits: yeah learned so much here
 MSmits: even from jacek
 Astrobytes: A lot from jacek
 Astrobytes: Despite the fact he is the Troll King
 VizGhar: yeah jacek is very helpful just ask him if you need something
 MSmits: allright a lot
 MSmits: but phrase it precisely
 Astrobytes: I think we should ping jacek once more
 MSmits: he will troll you if you dont say exactly what you mean
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 MSmits: it's jacek humor
 jacek: humor?
 MSmits: or maybe it's a bug, not a feature, i dunno jacek
 Astrobytes: *humour
 jacek: mour?
 jacek: n
 jacek: those brits
 MSmits: colour
 jacek: they wont exit the u
 MSmits: behaviour
 Astrobytes: I know. Making all the words for the rest of the world to use and spell incorrectly.
 MSmits: saviour
 VizGhar: parkur
 MSmits: how do you spell bigly?
 MSmits: is it bigley?
 MSmits: brits arent the only ones making words
 Jrabovsky: does anyone know what '.'*int(input()) does in python?
 MSmits: makes the input into an integer if it can
 MSmits: dont know what the * does
 Astrobytes: I think bigly is actually a word, but you'll be hard-pressed to find anyone using it
 DJSchaffner: nah it repeats the letter n times
 DJSchaffner: say you enter a 5
 DJSchaffner: it will be "....."
 MSmits: ohh right
 MSmits: i misses the dot
 Jrabovsky: ohhhh
 Jrabovsky: alright thank you
 Jrabovsky: had no clue what this guy did for his code
 MSmits: DJSchaffner already teaching
 DJSchaffner: :joy:
 DJSchaffner: why not if im already here and know the answer to it :D
 MSmits: of course
 Jrabovsky: thank you sm
 MSmits: man... i am dreading pasting this new code into my bot, my VS is already slow from 2 running meta mcts :P
 Astrobytes: 2?
 MSmits: yeah yavalath and oware current
 Astrobytes: ah
 MSmits: it's always oware and something else
 Astrobytes: yeah, I forgot you were revisiting Y
 MSmits: i'm just being forced to deal with two machine learning enthousiast trying to steal my spot :P
 struct: robo and jace k?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: you see the pony is higher despite no opening book
 DJSchaffner: oh wow you are rank 27 :o crazy stuff
 Astrobytes: the spirit of competition compels you MSmits!
 MSmits: jacek you should resubmit to be certain, the movement on the ladder is mostly due to repeated submits by me
 MSmits: i have everyone else counterbooked
 MSmits: your bot is still new to me
 MSmits: so of course i am pushing it up every time i submit
 derjack: as Celestia my witness, I will defeat you!
 MSmits: hehe good&#160;:)
 <b>**Astrobytes vomits in the corner</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: DJSchaffner thats overall rank
 MSmits: to get good overall rank it basically means you need to be somewhat good, but also very active, because it's mostly an activity score
 MSmits: it's better to look at individual arenas to see who's good
 DJSchaffner: ah i see
 Astrobytes: It's fairly reliable up to a point
 Astrobytes: (the rank/XP thing)
 Westicles: CP is probably the closest thing to reputation on here. 
 Astrobytes: but there are many excellent users out there with lower scores
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, for example, euler, who's on here all the time, is one of the best players, but he's definitely not *the* best, but he's nr 1 because he does well in everything and tries everything
 MSmits: or maybe he's 2 now
 MSmits: it varies
 jacek: hes 2nd. noob.
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: right, AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: ey solution is a lot of work to get it right
 jacek: eeyup
 derjack: eeyup
 MSmits: oh noes, the trolls are breeding
 Astrobytes: eeyup
 VizGhar: you will hear about euler a lot... german guys gets a lot of attention last century
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: Schmetterling!
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/38/17/0c3817ba605e61bc5163d536cd0eeb9e.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/38/17/0c3817ba605e61bc5163d536cd0eeb9e.jpg</a>
 VizGhar: lol jacek
 MSmits: nice one
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jacek: right, i got higher rank when resubmited
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: huh, it says 10
 jacek: i mean me
 MSmits: when i look at the board
 jacek: i was 10
 jacek: and pony was 5
 MSmits: ohh right, so i pushed you up
 MSmits: it's a good bot though
 MSmits: just like your jacek bot
 MSmits: they're both good. There's so much RPS going on between bots that its hard to say who's better
 DJSchaffner: are your bots measured by performance or is it also test cases?
 Astrobytes: winning matches
 MSmits: they just play games against eachother on submission of the bot
 DJSchaffner: ahh sounds cool
 Astrobytes: so, score based on that
 MSmits: sometimes one play submits a lot of times, that has the effect of dropping other players in rank that are particularly weak against that player
 MSmits: one player
 jacek: like cheating by using opening books :unamused:
 MSmits: this depends a lot on the game, some games dont really have this effect because bots are just objectively better allround
 MSmits: hey my bot found all those moves offline :P
 MSmits: like your bot found yours :P
 MSmits: mine just remembers them better
 MSmits: with opening books there is no "training loss "
 MSmits: it's funny how you receive this effect with so few moves. 1500 moves is less than all combinations of moves in the first 2 plies
 jacek: well there is, but you wont know until you lose with that move
 jacek: unless its been solved
 MSmits: its the same with opening books, except all information is persistent
 struct: under 1500 with mirrored board right?
 MSmits: ah yes i forgot about that
 MSmits: it's 12x more
 MSmits: but most players will always use the same orientation anyway
 MSmits: some random this
 MSmits: btw jacek, in oware i found games against recurse and games against you that were the same for the first 50 plies
 jacek: what a copy cat, that recurse
 MSmits: this is what good bots do, they choose from a very small subset of moves 
 MSmits: so you get almost identical games
 MSmits: well actually, its more like you have a range of games you play due to your random and some of those games are also recurses games
 jacek: dunno how rebless, robo has quite different inputs than mine
 struct: Is it possible to beat you on yavalath without a book?
 jacek: pony did few times
 MSmits: without book, my bot is in the same range has trictrac, dafish, renard and pb4
 MSmits: a little above darkhorse i think
 MSmits: i dont know how robo, jacek, equine jacek and others fit in
 struct: How hard is it to remove the book?
 struct: Just to test
 MSmits: it's a deletion
 struct: if you dont mind ofc
 MSmits: I'll probably end 5th or so
 MSmits: i'll try
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: i'm kind of curious myself
 MSmits: might do it 2 or 3 times to be sure
 MSmits: it will be slightly worse because it is still checking the book during the search, but its a small penalty
 MSmits: its checking an empty unordered set
 MSmits: mmh i may have to comment some stuff, sec.
 MSmits: here goes
 struct: :rocket:
 MSmits: well at least a full 10 win opening
 MSmits: tric trac is hard to beat
 MSmits: oo win vs jacek and pony :P
 DJSchaffner: oh wow i just got into a reverse mode clash
 DJSchaffner: that was tough, couldnt figure it out in time
 MSmits: yeah sometimes they are
 MSmits: or you figure it out right at the end
 MSmits: and no time to code
 MSmits: advantage of this submit without book is that it plays more randomly
 MSmits: so i wont get thhis situation where someone always beats me
 DJSchaffner: whats a common approach there? i tried to go at it step by step and see where it leads me. is figuring out the whole thing a better approach?
 MSmits: do you mean reverse clash?
 DJSchaffner: yes
 struct: was it numbers?
 jacek: the whole thing
 MSmits: most of us here dont clash at all, except when they introduced quests
 jacek: how can you do one thing a time?
 DJSchaffner: i took screenshots so i can try and solve it afterwwards :D
 DJSchaffner: ah okay
 struct: show it&#160;:)
 MSmits: bah losing streak
 struct: Lets see if I remember the clash
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/700318015421546526/791066045552263168/x.png?width=556&amp;height=714">https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/700318015421546526/791066045552263168/x.png?width=556&amp;height=714</a>
 DJSchaffner: sec, i will post them
 MSmits: not a good submit, but at least I'm beating pony sometimes
 MSmits: my bot has always been weak at the start, it really needs some help there

 MSmits: ugh that game hurts my eyes
 MSmits: the first few moves are sooo bad
 MSmits: corner lol
 MartinEduardo: hello guys
 struct: hi
 jacek: and DRAW?
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: I think i bugged my bot
 MSmits: when i removed book
 jacek: that would be cool solving draw at that point
 MSmits:  i was just gonna say  :P
 MSmits: maybe i can fix it and try again sec
 MSmits: aww crap book is more woven through my bot than i thought, thats why its bugging a bit. But the result wouldnt be much better than it is now i think
 MSmits: maybe 6th or so on a reasonable submit. Renard and Robo wreck me
 DJSchaffner: ok next try with the uploads

 MSmits: i colleague wanted me to solve this fizzbuzz puzzle once, not CG related
 struct: oh
 struct: just replace the&#160;% by the first input
 struct: and the 2nd&#160;% by the 2nd
 DJSchaffner: what i figured out was that some value starts a 1 and gets subtracted by (f - 1). no idea what happens afterwards and when it prints buzz or fizz but it stops when the value thats being tracked reaches n
 struct: should be it
 struct: the last input is the range

 jacek: oh my
 struct: its a nice clash imo
 DJSchaffner: even with that description its not clear to me after just reading it haha
 struct: I think referee works finally
 VizGhar: struct still STC? about how long does it take to you to reach legend in those games?
 VizGhar: I cant focus longer then a day or so :D that's why I'm so low ranked
 struct: This is my longest one
 struct: but im already legend there
 MSmits: struct has a longstanding obsession with STC
 struct: Im legend there for I think 2 years
 struct: But havent submited since then
 MSmits: but its been in the back of your head
 struct: yeah, I like it
 struct: Despite thinking it has a few problems
 DJSchaffner: does anyone have a better solution to the fizzbuff thing than i do? :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/yedetatela.apache">https://hastebin.com/yedetatela.apache</a>im not happy with mine but at least it works
 DJSchaffner: oh i did it in python btw
 MSmits: sorry not me
 MSmits: too busy trying to make this 3k line monster into something that works :P
 DJSchaffner: good luck with that then:smile:
 MSmits: soon&#160;:)
 DJSchaffner: anyways, it was nice chatting with you guys. good night!
 MSmits: gn!
 SupSon: let's say I have 9 bits, is there some efficient way I can duplicate the 9 bit pattern across the remaining 32/64 bits using some bitwise operations?
 <b>**LegendaryStone slaps  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: Thats a good questions for MSmits I think
 MSmits: oh hey
 MSmits: sorry wasnt paying attention
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: a short loop is what you need probably
 MSmits: x | x &lt;&lt; 9 | x &lt;&lt; 18 | x &lt;&lt; 27 also works
 MSmits: but thats basically a loop
 SupSon: oh ok thanks

 eulerscheZahl: that's a 30% redneck
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Biden either, they all crooks
 eulerscheZahl: i was ruling for Bernie
 Thorcode: Shepherd's crook?
 Thorcode: or it have another mean?
 eulerscheZahl: fraudster
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Politicians here are all garbage
 wyenat: Bernie "Gotta change the world to make it more equal" into "please "vote for this billionnaire from a powerfull family over this billionnaire from a powerful family" TWICE
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was rooting for Andrew Yang, but he quit... quitter...smh
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know that one
 wyenat: He's the universal revenue guy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: He liked entrepreneurs and tech
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Read the proposed US 2022 budget, proof positive they all crooks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it cost 100Billion to collect an extra 90Billion in taxes...smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not a redneck, I can do math
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm watching a Turkish Sitcom, oh crap it's a historical drama. heh

 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, yup they been finding all kinds of relics all the way across N America
 MeBen: y'all sometimes hope you get beat in clash because you feel like there's a clever solution you can't find? 
 Good_Coder: ya
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I trace my family back to the 11th century, when we arrived in Ireland.  Before that we were in a mountainous region of N. Spain.  In US since 1846...potato famine
 Thorcode: why all pro in cg got low rank in clash?
 Good_Coder: idk
 Thorcode: like the top one got rank 18000 in clash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: clash points are temporary
 MeBen: I think clash is newish, and a lot of the top ranked regular CG members probably haven't played much of it
 wyenat: Your clash points go down, so there's not much points to maintain them
 eulerscheZahl: thor because top players don't care about clash
 eulerscheZahl: we are here for the multiplayer games. i can assure you that i could climb the CoC ranks quickly
 wyenat: and let's be honnest, it's fun to be 1st in most challenging aspects like multiplayer league based games, CoC you're gonna find string that can be reversed approximately 100 times
 eulerscheZahl: yes. in short: repetitive and not really challenging
 eulerscheZahl: apart from golfing, i'm bad at those. but i don't feel joy doing it either
 wyenat: I think "size of code" is funny but suffers from language differences rather than ability
 wyenat: And reverse mode is plain out useless for me
 eulerscheZahl: choose the right tool for your problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: quick doesn't mean clean code, short doesn't mean readable... kinda enforces bad coding practices... although it doesn't take hours to get your coding fix
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, getting ready for work. bye
 PatrickMcGinnisII: later king eulerscheZahl
 wyenat: Sure, but competing in size of code is just Ruby vs exec(bytes) in python 
 TechnoBot: I just finished a puzzle, what r u guys talking about?
 TechnoBot: my ranks r going up!
 TechnoBot: i mean down
 TechnoBot: i mean like
 TechnoBot: u know
 dooon: reverse sucks big balls

 MSmits: wow 7x5 C4 takes me longer to solve than 7x6 C4, because 7x5 is a draw. I think I need to put my ab pruning for mcts solver in.
 MSmits: if most nodes are solved draws then mcts solver has a really hard time
 MSmits: this is a good way to test the effectiveness of the pruning trick too. I can compare both ways to do it
 struct: hi
 Bon[]Crayon: ho
 LittleFlea: on there is no spoon i just add the given string to a list in the readline loop and it give me an error sayin i didnt wait for all input before printing out something.why
 struct: are you reading all the inputs before outputing?
 LittleFlea: pretty sure .i didnt change their initial code at all .just add the given row to a list to iterate later.
 LittleFlea: an then i do another for loop to check for answer.my code work and everything when tried on VS but it always give me the error here
 struct: if you want message me the code
 struct: i can take a quick look
 MSmits: 2 million nodes to solve 7x5 and 500k nodes to solve 7x6. Damn
 struct: how long does that take to solve?
 niluthebear: Harcoded typo In There is no Spoon - Episode 1 Note Section
 MSmits: the 2 million took a few hours
 struct: not too bad
 MSmits: each node is either a solve with &lt; 70 ms or a played game
 struct: do you use bitboards?
 MSmits: yeah, both in the meta mcts and in the bot that it uses to play the games an solve
 MSmits: but just to be clear, the 2 million could have been like 50k i think, if not less, if i used optimizations for draws
 MSmits: seeing it happen live, made me realize how important these are
 struct: you know that because the game isnt solved as a draw right?
 MSmits: 7x5 is solved as a draw
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66f8a807-fc56-44c7-87d2-d8ec4861832e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66f8a807-fc56-44c7-87d2-d8ec4861832e</a>

 MSmits: you can see how much easier it solves
 struct: maybe you need to update some stuff before you move into the other board sizes
 MSmits: i will
 MSmits: i am using these smaller sizes as a testbed
 MSmits: i am just happy so far all the results are identical to the known results
 MSmits: so i think i am bug free
 derjack: or you both are wrong
 niluthebear: Oo
 MSmits: thats always a possibility, but a remote one when there's so many sizes to check&#160;:)
 struct: i would solve it on paper just to be sure
 MSmits: lol!
 MSmits: i dont have enough paper even for the smal ones
 Astrobytes: Write a proof. ezpz
 MSmits: bleh doesn't sound like fun
 MSmits: once I am done optimizing the solver I might write it out on tech.io
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: the tricks for dealing with draws i mean
 Astrobytes: yep
 MSmits: i think to some degree it's helpful in a normal bot too. I am going to have to do it in the meta mcts program first and then try it in the bot itself. Both times i should get improvement
 Astrobytes: Seems a promising idea at least
 MSmits: I know it works because sometimes I am looking at the parent node having 3 drawn children and 1 unsolved child. The unsolved child already has a drawn child, which means the whole thing is a draw, but it just keeps searching, sometimes wasting minutes to an hour
 Astrobytes: an hour!
 MSmits: easily, i think the 5 hrs it spent solving 7x5 could have been 15 mins or less, that's my guess
 struct: damn
 Astrobytes: Jeez. That's... significant
 MSmits: yeah, the thing is, with solved wins or losses you only have to fully explore every other layer, with the draw trick you can get close to that
 MSmits: brb
 Diwash: :ok_hand:
 Thorcode: ruby kinda cool
 Thorcode: in shortest
 niluthebear: the numbering of rows and cols of there is no spoon made me lot of bugs
 darkhorse64: "I know it works because sometimes I am looking at the parent node having 3 drawn children and 1 unsolved child. The unsolved child already has a drawn child, which means the whole thing is a draw". Err, what if one of the unsolved nodes is a win&#160;?

 Thorcode: ok I will keep clashing :D
 Thorcode: yeah my rank up in clash
 Astrobytes: Thorcode: we don't require a running commentary thank you
 Uljahn: darkhorse64: if one of the unsolved nodes is a win then it's a loss for the parent child
 Uljahn: which is worse than draws
 darkhorse64: Thanks, I always forget to "change the sign" when backpropagating
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/G7iT54b">https://imgur.com/a/G7iT54b</a>
 struct: oh I see
 struct: I dont have that in my solver
 MSmits: hey that's my pic
 MSmits: i recognize the amateurish paint skills
 MSmits: you can even make use of this during selection btw. 
 MSmits: don't select children that have at least 1 drawn child
 MSmits: because those can no longer be wins
 MSmits: only when all children have 1 drawn child, do you start selecting them
 MSmits: as soon as one of them gets solved as a draw, the whole thing is a draw. So you're tackling the problem both from the selection side and from the solver side
 darkhorse64: Although I do not use it in selection, I have a best/worst result in my node. Once solved, best == worst. This way, you can still backpropagate "at least draws", even if not all nodes are not yet solved.
 darkhorse64: too many "not". Even if all nodes are not yet solved
 Uljahn: here's another MSmits' pic <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/WT2rvDU">https://imgur.com/a/WT2rvDU</a>
 struct: does your current bot has this features MSmits?
 struct: these*
 MSmits: no, the current bot has a TT only
 MSmits: In the meta mcts program it's a nobrainer, but in the nornal bot it could only be a small improvement or none. It complicates things
 struct: hmm, I might try
 struct: it seems easy  to implement
 MSmits: it's not hard, just becareful at the root node
 MSmits: you could have a root solved as a draw, with only 1 of its children solved
 MSmits: all the other children will have at least a drawn node
 MSmits: (child)
 MSmits: but because of the pruning, the exploration stopped
 MSmits: you can research the children or just select the fully solved node, the other ones will be draws or worse, so...
 struct: yeah should not really matter much
 MSmits: i think i'll go for the easy fix
 MSmits: this helped me solve a little bit faster in drawn uttt games
 struct: this should prune the tree a lot I guess
 MSmits: but c4 has way more draws
 struct: maybe not prune but it will help you to explore other nodes
 MSmits: yeah, you know that that particular branch will be at most a draw, so it's better to go elsewhere
 struct: time to open my tic tac toe mcts bot and test it there
 MSmits: so even in non-drawn games you should have some benefit. Also our c4 with starting move 1 seems to be a solved draw, so that matters
 MSmits: I say *seems* because i have no proof
 MSmits: I continued my 7x6 solver for the 1 and 2 starting moves.  Move 0 is a loss and move 3 is a win. I just realized this could take a day without the draw optimizations
 MSmits: does anyone know if the 1 and 2 moves in c4 are draws?
 MSmits: (normal 7x6 c4)
 sobirjon: hello!
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://connect4.gamesolver.org/">https://connect4.gamesolver.org/</a> will get you all answers
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: thats great
 MSmits: 1 is a loss and 2 is a draw
 MSmits: so it's loss-loss-draw-win from left to right
 MSmits: seems consistent: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/cEBZAKL">https://imgur.com/a/cEBZAKL</a>
 MSmits: I could use this site to verify the whole tree
 MSmits: or at least a sizable chunk. To see if i have bugs
 darkhorse64: The source code for the solver (mm based) is also available
 MSmits: oh, yeah i've seen several of those. Have you seen any based on mcts solver? It seems fairly rare
 darkhorse64: Only MM so far
 struct: you can even do post to get positions to check with yours

 ja_fica: I'm trying several configs. I will try it local xD
 ja_fica: the NN may behave fine sometimes
 ja_fica: my bot is what I like to call very unstable
 ja_fica: maybe I should remove TT for now xD
 MSmits: ja_fica test vs a local bot that has a random component. Maybe one with extra calculation time to make it stronger
 MSmits: going by the leaderboard seems like a bad idea
 MSmits: with all those deterministic bots
 ja_fica: yh, I don't really kow what to change
 MSmits: you give it maybe 1 full second per move, but on the value calculation you do +- 0.05 
 ja_fica: NN outputs seems to be working very nice
 ja_fica: at least ooutputs what I trained them for
 MSmits: this reminds me of when i trained that TTT NN
 MSmits: it could play perfectly 97% of the time
 MSmits: 100% seems impossible
 ja_fica: but my bot is losing too much
 MSmits: yes but when it loses, how many mistakes did it really make. it could be only 1
 ja_fica: I can try convolutions and use PUCT instead, but convs are much slower
 ja_fica: good point of view
 MSmits: You could try train a c4 7x6 bot and then test various architectures for your NN vs known positions to get a&#160;% for the number of mistakes it makes
 MSmits: 9x7 should not be that different
 MSmits: you can get a much better idea of what general approaches work well
 ja_fica: I will try to use PUCT now, it seems to make sense
 MSmits: also testing convolution and such
 ja_fica: im just propagating the value of the state right now
 ja_fica: im wasting the power of the NN
 MSmits: you mean no policy?
 MSmits: jace k never uses policy afaik
 MSmits: and does well
 ja_fica: I have tried multiple configs
 ja_fica: this time I wanted to try a smaller network using only the value
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i watched that documentary about alpha go
 MSmits: with the game vs Lee Sedol
 ja_fica: like jacek but the difference is that he backpropagates like minimax
 MSmits: quite cool 
 MSmits: ah yeah it's very easy to switch between ept style backprop and his jacekmax thingy
 MSmits: you can try both and see what works
 MSmits: i never use his method either. I believe it works, but i never got it to work better and it doesn't really click with me
 MSmits: that it is supposed to work
 ja_fica: the version I use it is still a faster solver because of the TT
 ja_fica: this last bot was not so terrible as the others
 MSmits: ahh that's good to hear
 martinpapa69: convolution works much worse on c4
 martinpapa69: for me at least
 NlCKSTER: Hello
 J_The_Legend: hi
 NlCKSTER: Im a self taught beginner in C++ any recommendations to better my skill?
 J_The_Legend: hmmm 
 J_The_Legend: i am good at almost all languages naturally
 J_The_Legend: i am not sure how to give youany tips here
 NlCKSTER: Nice im getting there, this website seems fun!
 ankan2526: hmm
 ankan2526: too much fun
 J_The_Legend: try coding things that challenge you 
 colver123: :unamused:
 jacek: Oo
 JacobTheCoder: one day jacek is gonna be a mod i can feel it
 TheBlueBias: :scream:
 darkhorse64: Fear jacek ban hammer&#160;!!
 Mortis_666: hi
 MSmits: there is a good reason i don't want jacek to be mod
 MSmits: he'd be forced to ban himself and then I'd miss him
 struct: or he would stop trolling
 TheBlueBias: Mods can't ban mods.
 struct: mods cant even delete the account...
 struct: their own account
 TheBlueBias: Nobody can...
 Astrobytes: He was actually offered the position of mod (believe it or not) but he excused himself on account of being a massive troll
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: wait struct, don't tell me you found this out because you tried to delete yourself again?
 MSmits: there must be some help-line fo rthis
 struct: ofc, any mod is free to test it&#160;:)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: or maybe its a bit risky :p
 struct: and im joking
 MSmits: well I am going to fill a hole again
 MSmits: I dug it 2 days ago and now I am going to fill it again
 Astrobytes: Just for the fun of it right?
 MSmits: no, it's different type of  sand
 MSmits: tiling part of my front and backyard
 Astrobytes: ah I see
 struct: have fun
 MSmits: thanks
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: hi! Just fyi, I am a kid, and most chats end up being innappropriate for my age, so please try to refrain from innappropriate convos on world chat byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 Luigis3: :pizza:
 Astrobytes: Er... right
 Luigis3: Pete za
 jacek: bloody hell
 Astrobytes: Stop it Luigis3
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: sorry i say that every time I join a new chat bc I am 12
 Luigis3: my bad 
 TheBlueBias: I know that MSmits. Almost no more place in my backyard, I dig up at least 2 or 3 corpses before finding a free emplacement... That's boring... :weary:
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: lol... no corpses here
 MSmits: but my previous house supposedly had a car buried under my lawn
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: A dead car?
 MSmits: i never dug down to check. Neighbors told me this
 struct: nice trolls
 struct: Your neighbor was jacek
 TheBlueBias: Oh... Do you rent&#160;? :innocent:
 MSmits: who knows
 MSmits: i rent yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah. They probably were waiting to watch you dig a massive hole for no reason whatsoever
 MSmits: lol yes
 TheBlueBias: I mean as renter.
 MSmits: got it
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: no i dont
 MSmits: are you asking to live with me, then the answer is no :P
 Astrobytes: I think blaise means are you the landlord for that place
 MSmits: nope
 omboyo: does anyone wanna help me with: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63980336fc4b13ed3c23c5a8a6ebdfe836fe">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63980336fc4b13ed3c23c5a8a6ebdfe836fe</a> :smile:
 MSmits: anyways ttyl
 Astrobytes: Later. Don't forget to give us the 'hole' story when you come back
 RJ9: Hi I'm  new I'm only 9 but I'm in GT so I kinda have to learn code
 TheBlueBias: No. Just need another place to, huh... "tidy" my "clients". :rolling_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: "Already more than 10 000 players have registered to the event! Will you be there too? "who of you registered before the official announcement of the format?
 MACKEYTH: I did
 Wontonimo: i did
 jacek:&#160;:(
 struct: did they mail that?
 TheBlueBias: I did.
 Wontonimo: mail what?
 struct: What euler said
 Wontonimo: i dont remember
 TheBlueBias: Well. BlaiSe did.
 TheBlueBias: I registered after...
 eulerscheZahl: yes struct, I got it per mail
 eulerscheZahl: telling my why I should join the fun
 eulerscheZahl: Hello, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/709bac82-d5a7-4158-a3ae-ac868f8f7e84">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/709bac82-d5a7-4158-a3ae-ac868f8f7e84</a>
 eulerscheZahl: somehow none of their 3 points can convince me
 niluthebear: those fun days when the contest starts&#160;:( 
 eulerscheZahl: and the submit takes 2h just to pass wood
 struct: when 5/7 are related to team
 struct: Not for me
 TheBlueBias: The 3 are pretty discouraging
 struct: but idc much about it anymore
 struct: im doing other stuff anyways
 Foxwizard5556: whats happening
 TheBlueBias: Yes.
 Wontonimo: the earth is rotating
 Wontonimo: it may cause dizziness
 MSmits: only if you don't pick the correct rotating frame of refence
 MSmits: reference
 TheBlueBias: &amp;
 MSmits: | 
 niluthebear: ^
 TheBlueBias: Meh.
 MSmits: we are doing favorite bit ops right?
 TheBlueBias: Nope
 MSmits: o
 niluthebear: False
 TheBlueBias: &amp; is the reference symbol in c++
 MSmits: oh
 niluthebear: Oo
 Foxwizard5556: haha nice one big brain
 TheBlueBias: The 3yo kid is back :scream:
 Foxwizard5556: oh yeah i am
 Foxwizard5556: :burrito:
 MSmits: you are a burrito?
 TheBlueBias: Wontonimo gonna eat you...
 Foxwizard5556: haha no i'm a :taco::hamburger:
 jacek: taco?
 Foxwizard5556: nah 
 Foxwizard5556: big brIANS
 TheBlueBias: Who's brian?
 Kafteji: brian is in the kitchen
 Foxwizard5556: COOL
 TheBlueBias: French joke Kafteji ^^
 TheBlueBias: Anyway Foxwizard5556, 3 years old is a little young to go on internet...
 MSmits: it's safe, he can't swallow his computer
 TheBlueBias: :D
 Astrobytes: Foxwizard5556: you're already on a warning.
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: 10 000? :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: lots of players register for the next event right after a contest
 MSmits: I did too
 Scarfield: yea i did that
 eulerscheZahl: i might give jrke's Rubik a shot
 eulerscheZahl: i always register last-minute
 TheBlueBias: Needed it to unlock IA path on questmap...
 eulerscheZahl: so now it works?
 TheBlueBias: For a few days yes.
 struct: you can always count the number of teams to get the actual players
 Westicles: all the twitch guys seem to have switched from clashes to binarysearch
 MSmits: batman?
 Astrobytes: MSmits: yes?
 Astrobytes: ah crap
 Astrobytes: :P
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://binarysearch.com/">https://binarysearch.com/</a>
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: did they rename it?
 Scarfield: lol Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Scarfield: darkKnighstrobytes
 MSmits: The bytes we deserve but not the ones we need?
 Astrobytes: Scarlfred
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: why do we segfault sir
 pardis: Does anyone need a team member, I can do c/c++/python
 MSmits: then you're overqualified  :P
 MSmits: they should make a looking-for-team channel
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: :rofl:
 pardis: Yeah everyone is doing that, so no one end up on any team
 Scarfield: i think discord will be a better place to find a team pardis
 Westicles: The only time I played I kept erasing Astro's code... that was fun
 MSmits: you mean you were fixing bugs Westicles&#160;?
 Westicles: well, no... 
 Scarfield: but also yes
 Astrobytes: my code?
 Scarfield: was the sherlock escape any good?
 struct: Programming 696 / 696pts (100%) BETTER THAN&gt;99%Time to retire
 UndercoverToad: I wish I were that good
 Westicles: I think it was Astro... we were a team and I didn't realize code was shared
 Scarfield: im definately gonna be better than &gt;99‰
 Westicles: then euler left and it all fell apart
 JaYS: ‰ sure
 Astrobytes: Wasn't me Westicles, I only played with T Bali, struc t and Scarfield
 MSmits: Hey euler I heard from dreadylein that you were awesome on a contest he was in
 Scarfield: oh you havent played the sherlock then, im up for it some day
 MSmits: one part of it you beat everyone?
 eulerscheZahl: i only did the coding tasks. by far the easiest track IMO (of course that's relative, depends on your skills)
 Astrobytes: Sure Scarfield, not seen TBali around recently mind you
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: there was 1 tasks where we had the first solve of all teams. then again there were 15 tasks open all at the same time and I started with that one
 MSmits: ahh I see. Still kinda cool to be the first
 eulerscheZahl: was a fun contest
 Scarfield: im in no hurry, he will turn up again&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: dready did the binary tasks
 eulerscheZahl: that is: you have an executable file and have to figure out what that program does
 MSmits: yeah he can do that kind of magical stuff
 eulerscheZahl: that's why I asked him
 Astrobytes: zeno on crypto/linux duty?
 TheBlueBias:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: zeno was busy with work and didn't even tell us where he is until after the event&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: ah OK
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl — 10/18/2021I was hoping for a more interesting story 😞 trapped in an elevator maybe. or on an escalator
 MSmits: he was in hiding?
 Astrobytes: TheBlueBias: what were you specialising in?
 Westicles: zeno has been hiding from the french
 TheBlueBias: Psychological support
 MSmits: Trolling other teams?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: "support"
 eulerscheZahl: that's forbidden
 MSmits: TheBlueBias is skilled, he knows where the line is
 eulerscheZahl: zeno nominated Blaise btw
 TheBlueBias: Oh?
 Astrobytes: yeah I know
 eulerscheZahl: Blaise or Westicles were his suggestions. One of them was online at the time, the other wasn't. on a coinflip
 jacek: huh
 jacek: is GA without crossover just some hill climbing?
 eulerscheZahl: a few parallel hillclimbings I would say
 Scarfield: GA without crossover would be MA
 jacek: Meh Algorithm?
 Scarfield: Mutation Algo
 Scarfield: you could also have a mix of both and get MAGA
 azis_i_vanko1: hello guys
 elisaado: hey goys
 Uljahn: also looks like MC beam search
 JacobTheCoder: i got my script done im just trying to put it in a "loadstring" but it isnt working...
 JacobTheCoder: any idea on how i can fix that?
 JacobTheCoder: hello
 JacobTheCoder: ima go watch a tutorial hold on
 KayKay1202: pls follow me
 JacobTheCoder: why
 KayKay1202: so i can challenge you on clash of code
 JacobTheCoder: what type of code?
 KayKay1202: and to makw friends
 JacobTheCoder: im in class and im about to switch so illl follow you and msg you when im back on (i have a sub in math anyways)
 KayKay1202: same
 KayKay1202: i am at school
 JacobTheCoder: yeah got all my work done so i figured "lets try to make my script a loadstring"
 KayKay1202: my teacher has no clue
 JacobTheCoder: but that didnt go as lanned
 JacobTheCoder: go to dm
 zeplul: put code in pastebin and copy paste link into loadstring template
 zeplul: raw link*
 KayKay1202: what is dm
 JacobTheCoder: i msged you
 JacobTheCoder: also thanks zep
 AntiSquid: hahah Scarfield
 AntiSquid: i prefer the Let's Go Automaton2000 algo
 JacobTheCoder: hi squid
 Automaton2000: are you looking for a way to make a game for cg&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no, i am not a squid&#160;:'(
 AntiSquid: i always drive safely
 AntiSquid: what's up JacobGreenslade
 AntiSquid: JacobTheCoder
 Scarfield: yea its a great algo, the best, many coders use it
 JacobTheCoder: "JacobGreenSlade" - AniSquid 10/21/2021 02:08PM
 jacek: no more loa talks eh?
 AntiSquid: JacobTheCoder i used tab complete, maybe it would help you write my name :P
 JacobTheCoder: oh it was no big deal jus the perfect time to quote someone&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: wrote  Jaco-&gt;Tab and got that, too many jacobs in chat, maybe you should clash to see who keeps the name
 JacobTheCoder: im probably gonna change it to my YT
 JacobTheCoder: but idk cause i dont do coding videos
 JacobTheCoder: and its pretty cringy
 KayKay1202: Hey
 AntiSquid: now you can link your twitch coding stream and stream on youtube too&#160;! the future is here
 USSR_Chicken: and im waiting for the cringe comments about my name XD
 USSR_Chicken: im probably gonna change it back
 Seito_Shinkiel: can we not see the right answer for a clash&#160;? it's frustrating
 eulerscheZahl: a reverse task?
 USSR_Chicken: i hate it when im doing clash and i just see the code
 USSR_Chicken: just make me wanna
 Seito_Shinkiel: I mean , can we see the answer, if we don't find the right solution for a problem&#160;? 
 USSR_Chicken: i can
 USSR_Chicken: sometimes atleast
 eulerscheZahl: only if the other players decide to share their code
 eulerscheZahl: if it's reverse and you can't figure out the task, search here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 jacek: shameless advertising
 Hidatara: can we see opponent answer for clash? idk about mine,just wanna know how that madafaka can fix the code XD 
 Mesmerize: A lot of the puzzles seem to have changed names - how come?
 Wontonimo: lawyers
 Mesmerize: or changed graphics
 Mesmerize: I see
 Wontonimo: lawyers part 2
 jacek: should make puzzle about blood sucking lawyers
 Wontonimo: or fear of lawyers
 Wontonimo: may not have been lawyers.  may have been management afraid of lawsuits 
 Wontonimo: I had a boss once who would regularly tell the law department at work to go suck it and not do what they said
 Wontonimo: his response to me was that their job is to advise, not dictate.  And lawyers don't particularly make good business decisions, if they did we'd see more Lawyer CEOs
 USSR_Chicken: hi Wontonimo
 USSR_Chicken: very interesting
 Wontonimo: hey JacobTheCoder :wave:
 USSR_Chicken: i got my friend to help me out and i made my own mod menu for multiple games like gta, firtnite and all those
 USSR_Chicken: fortnite*
 USSR_Chicken: im working on one for minecraft and roblox
 USSR_Chicken: but yeah
 SandmanSW96: heya kylaro
 TheBlueBias: Enter sandman.
 bearnilu: hello
 vedantiscool2010: hi
 tobk: What happened with some of the Covers? Did CG get a cease&amp;desist from Disney?
 Astrobytes: Pre-emptive I think, due to growing as a company and being taken over
 Rick-o-matic: I guys I am really new to this - I am on Cosers strikes back and my code is valid but it just goes to dust immediately, any idea why?
 jacek: is it that destrinationY and destinationY?
 Rick-o-matic: no, im past that, it's the angle part
 Astrobytes: what happens?
 Astrobytes: Pod doesn't move... goes the wrong waY?
 Astrobytes: *way
 Rick-o-matic: I think it the way I am using else
 Astrobytes: you can paste your code here
 Rick-o-matic: what was happening was the game just stopped in a dust storm
 derjack: and what exactly is that "coders strike back" you speak of?
 jacek: so you program crashed?
 Astrobytes: derjack: get back in the jacek box
 Rick-o-matic: mate, I am a total beginner
 jacek: do you have any errors under the viewer?
 Astrobytes: Seems like it crashed.
 Rick-o-matic: CS8641: 'else' cannot start a statement.
 Astrobytes: just paste your code in here (in chat)
 jacek: so program didnt even compile
 Astrobytes: (It will pastebin automatically)
 Rick-o-matic: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c90bd28-36cb-4c36-9601-f4c92d6a9fdb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c90bd28-36cb-4c36-9601-f4c92d6a9fdb</a>
 Astrobytes: you missed a }
 Astrobytes: before the else
 Rick-o-matic: ah
 Rick-o-matic: but I don't need one before the IF?
 Astrobytes: can you post all the code please? It's not possible to see your nested braces
 jacek: you just have more { than }
 Rick-o-matic: Bear with me, it looks like a three year old has been at it with a crayon...
 Rick-o-matic: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89f00696-461b-4c8f-835e-511207557c49">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89f00696-461b-4c8f-835e-511207557c49</a>
 Astrobytes: 1. You don't need { and } around your print to stderr
 Astrobytes: 2. Fix that brace I told you about
 Astrobytes: 3. Print your actual output to stdout not stderr
 Astrobytes: (point 1: your first print)
 Astrobytes: 4. remove that brace on line 37
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a0b73f9-c3e0-4e36-a942-a2d0e45b873a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a0b73f9-c3e0-4e36-a942-a2d0e45b873a</a>
 Astrobytes: 5. There is a semicolon after your initial if condition. Remove that
 Rick-o-matic: I'm getting a timeout
 Rick-o-matic: still getting the crash :D
 Rick-o-matic: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec509a0f-0e54-4600-8d35-cc4a353bd806">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec509a0f-0e54-4600-8d35-cc4a353bd806</a>
 Rick-o-matic: If think that is cleaner
 Astrobytes: See my earlier point 3
 Astrobytes: change to Console.WriteLine for the outputs within your if-else clauses
 Astrobytes: Right now you are only printing to stderr
 Rick-o-matic: ahhh
 Astrobytes: and you still have an extra }
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, no you don't, just poor indentation&#160;;)
 Rick-o-matic: Maybe I should take indentation classes :D
 Astrobytes: lol, if you're using this style just get each closing brace to align with the opening brace, pay attention to the IDE
 Rick-o-matic: It is weird, I write these codes, it crashes loads then I get promoted to the next league... 
 Astrobytes: Does it work now?
 Rick-o-matic: yeah it runs
 Rick-o-matic: I refreshed the browser
 Rick-o-matic: Thanks btw
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: Now you know the kind of things to look out for and be careful of
 jzen: Is there any way to modify contributions post-approval?
 Moncef_dev:  
 Astrobytes: TheBlueBias: Sent you a Sabbath concert on discord
 passionismymiddlename: I dont understand this am too dumb
 passionismymiddlename: I NEED SOMETHING EASY
 Astrobytes: Stop shouting ffs
 Astrobytes: What are you trying to do?
 passionismymiddlename: am trying to be good at python
 passionismymiddlename: but am failing
 Astrobytes: which puzzle are you doing, and are you competent in basic python?
 Rick-o-matic: Maybe a stupid question here... but where would I go to become competent at basic c#...
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: am doing "easy" puzzles like pedestrain traffic and i have no expirience in python
 Rick-o-matic: I thought I would start here, but it seeming a little of a stretch for my grey matter
 Astrobytes: passionismymiddlename: here they assume basic working knowledge of at least one language, basic logic etc
 Astrobytes: It's more for building on what you know
 Astrobytes: Rick-o-matic: same as above
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: uh huh but is there anything that can support starting
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: out
 Astrobytes: passionismymiddlename: are you experienced in any other language other than python? If not, it's best to learn elsewhere, this site will not teach you any language. It will force you to learn more about your given language and focuses more on algorithms
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: No but maybe i can just watch some indian tutrorials
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: and then i can build off of that i will see what i can do
 Astrobytes: Again, this is not the site to learn your first language. But if you want to learn at the same time elsewhere and practice here then feel free&#160;:)
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: ok 4 hours  is waaaaayyyyy too long
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: whatever
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: thanks for the words and advice
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: i have already learnt basic stuff in 2 minutes yay
 Astrobytes: ...
 MeBen: ...
 redrhyno: ,,,
 Gabbek: Good evening, Astrobytes!
 passionisNOTmymiddlename: :_[
 Gabbek: passionismymiddlename - if you want to learn more about python I would suggest one of the websites that's focused on the language teaching, for example: jetbrains academy
 TheBlueBias: Thanks Astrobytes. I'll take a look tomorrow, time to sleep a little for now. ^^
 TheBlueBias: GN
 Gabbek: good night
 Astrobytes: gn TheBlueBias

 Wontonimo: literally
 Wontonimo: Porsuk, what tree is that?  There isn't one called "coding speed"
 Thorcode: it is speed tree

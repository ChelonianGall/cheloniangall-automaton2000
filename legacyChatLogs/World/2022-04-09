 zakacat: eat taco
 Zingg: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Gunin: hello
 Gunin: anyone here
 Hafizur046: hi
 Gunin: i am new here 
 Gunin: what do we need to do here
 Hafizur046: just play clash of code all day every day 
 Gunin: :thinking:
 Gunin: what is that
 Gunin: coding challenge?
 Hafizur046: navigate to the compete page, u will find it there
 Gunin: okay
 Gunin: got it
 Gunin: thanks
 therealbeef: There are puzzles (write program that finds the solution), optimization (single-player, get highest score), multiplayer (your bot plays against other bots in a ranking), contests (twice a year, it's  a multiplayer but only 2 weeks and with some prices), clashes (15 minute mini competitions), code golf (write shortest program)
 Gunin: okay
 Gunin: thanks\
 zakacat: I personally love this site for practice, but a question to the higher level peeps, Is there lots of value to using and practicing on the site, personally?
 therealbeef: it's fun&#160;:)
 zakacat: but is it valuable?
 therealbeef: hmm, the coding style most people use here is probably not so suitable for professional developer jobs hehe, but you can learn new things that can benefit you; giving new algorithms a try on problems, and you can learn about how to optimize code for speed which is a useful general skill
 therealbeef: and just knowledge of the languages
 jacek: happy Caturday
 DaNinja: o/
 zakacat: Maybe in Poland!
 zakacat: still friday here in Canada
 zakacat: but thanks
 zakacat: and thanks to realbeef. good take
 zakacat: I think the fact that it is fun makes up for any lack of utility
 jacek: to be frank, i dont use 'sophisticated' algorithms used here in my job
 jacek: i.e. i dont use (consciously) graphs
 zakacat: what kinda job u got?
 zakacat: I need a job
 zakacat: lol
 zakacat: sorry
 zakacat: and I have yet to tackle graphs:stuck_out_tongue:
 Timegoeswell: hi
 Timegoeswell:&#160;?

 den-kuznetsov: hi here!
 tchet_nt: Can anyone help me with this math problem?
 eulerscheZahl: which math problem? i don't see any

 lmldev: .
 tchet_nt: Select all numbers, that are equal to 0 (help me )
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Oo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :owl:
 eulerscheZahl: there's only one number that is 0. i don't get it
 eulerscheZahl: we call this number "zero"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: array_sum($braincells)==0?yes:no
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dedb43aa-ce97-42be-a729-e1874e38df96">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dedb43aa-ce97-42be-a729-e1874e38df96</a>
 therealbeef: argh stupid bug; forgot that at certain values adding 1 to a float doesn't increase the value anymore
 eulerscheZahl: for (int i = 0; i &lt;= maxInt; i++) // do something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks better here:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/AlphaZero">https://www.chessprogramming.org/AlphaZero</a>
 therealbeef: nr_of_wins was a float, so mcts was starting to act weird after 200M rollouts orso
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1963 das Zero Manifest...wierd
 eulerscheZahl: interesting case of more rollouts making MCTS performing worse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: off to the store at 4:43 am, that's a rollout
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tata
 eulerscheZahl: i could have passed round 1 at codejam, tasks were easy enough
 eulerscheZahl: but round started at 3am and I have priorities

 PatrickMcGinnisII: “In some ways, then, the system is a bit like your racist uncle
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know my uncle well enough to judge his political point of view
 PatrickMcGinnisII: quoting the article
 eulerscheZahl: i got that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I recently bought a AfterShokz aeropex, now I should make a voice changer
 jacek: goa'ulds eh
 Westicles: I got stuck on the 2nd problem.  Worked locally but just said runtime error on codejam, had no idea how to debug
 Thorcode: you use the test might help
 eulerscheZahl: those interactive problems are a pain on codejam. more more convenient here on CG
 Thorcode: code jam is harder than kickstart
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, stick to the one's with $ prizes
 eulerscheZahl: it's not realistic to win any money at codejam if you don't practice that kind of tasks for years
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I want to improve the voices of the people calling me ... like make my GF sound hotter
 Thorcode: Kickstart also have prize i think
 Thorcode: nah
 eulerscheZahl: IMO it's easier to get into prize ranks on marathon contests, as those usually have much less contestants
 Westicles: I'm trying to make a puzzle contrib, it seems to be a stable roommate problem, never heard of that before
 eulerscheZahl: is that similar to the stable marriage problem?
 Westicles: Yeah, except mine doesn't have preferences
 Westicles: well, all preferences are equal I guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rednecks have rogue kids too
 eulerscheZahl: "This is distinct from the stable-marriage problem in that the stable-roommates problem allows matches between any two elements, not just between classes of "men" and "women"."(from wikipedia)
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/103114d45867aa1d07f4c0eebe6027ef2fcf2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/103114d45867aa1d07f4c0eebe6027ef2fcf2</a>
 Westicles: I thought it would be easy but it seems a little tricky
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 to a bed, interesting.  What's the bong ratio?
 Westicles: that's ep2
 PenguinPero: New video from me, this time Scrabble puzzle&#160;:)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsHjTul3B_I&amp;ab_channel=PenguinPero">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsHjTul3B_I&amp;ab_channel=PenguinPero</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i think it would be easier for parsing, when you give the number of possible partners in input too (instead of "until end of line")
 eulerscheZahl: Moonbeam 3Jerry Gary Saffron
 Westicles: well sure, but I can't figure out the best way to solve it
 eulerscheZahl: that's another story. looks complicated to me
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a solution right away, that does not evolve around bruteforce and can handle N=1000
 Westicles: hmmm, okay thanks
 eulerscheZahl: not that you can give us N=1000 anyways, limited input size
 eulerscheZahl: the 3 per bed instead of 2 makes it very different from stable roommates
 Westicles: I think you can weed out all groups that only match 3 or less, and then do recursion on what's left
 eulerscheZahl: that's a trick which only works if the input set allows you to
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, looks like you have to pre sort, and then just start shoving people into beds. looks like a tree would be wider than tall...hmmm ... reminds me of number shifting, lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Westicles testcase 1: first bed: MJS, 2nd: G 3rd: S ... 3 beds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why 4?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh they are all 4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry
 Westicles: Saffron and Jerry can't share
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahhh, but with a name like moonbeam
 Westicles: I don't have test cases or solution, just wanted to see if there is some obvious algorithm
 Westicles: I'm sure there's 4 lines of python that can do it
 eulerscheZahl: ask JBM for some haskell magic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's probably a matrices reduction, but it's over my head
 eulerscheZahl: not sure, might be NP complete
 Westicles: unRLE, sort, border... 1-star
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. 3SAT also sounds simple enough but is NP
 PatrickMcGinnisII: with the limited input, brute is easy enough
 eulerscheZahl: constraints say N=1000
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now that sounds like a hashcode from last year
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 to a bed, rather like drawing triangles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: would N&gt;100 put it into MC territory?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: drop a N=100, and see if a slow lang can bruteforce it
 Westicles: yeah, this is like drug interactions, I thought that would be 1000 and I barely got 100 to work
 eulerscheZahl: and you got some hate from #fr
 eulerscheZahl: but that's normal, they hate my minesweeper interpretation too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did drug interactions with my slow self
 Westicles: you and moonbeam eh?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: moon frye maybe
 pandaburger: Where do we click on this site to see past exercises? Is it hidden so that we can't learn? lol
 pandaburger: ahh I see, I have to click on a category, view all, then scroll all the way down to the bottom where the "Completed" ones are listed
 eulerscheZahl: you can also click the level part on the start page. the XP history has links to completed puzzles
 TanninCole: Is there a way to see puzzles we started but didn't finish? 
 SandmanSW96: TanninCole if you submitted it even if it wasn't 100%, those should show up at the top of their difficulty catagory list in Practice area

 Hackker: I have a question pls look at my pastebin
 Hackker: thank you very much
 therealbeef: seen stays empty, so that if statement is always false, so it just iterates over your arr and then finishes (never hits the return True line)
 jacek: this code works fast
 Uljahn: though slower than return None
 therealbeef: indeed not really optimized
 Uljahn: looks like this is just a part of the full code
 Tommyyy: Who likes Kotlin?
 ClonedDev: Haven't tried it

 eulerscheZahl: also there is CG local which works for firefox too
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '

 Automaton2000: have you read the inputs
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. jacek now has 26 taco
 Automaton2000: you mean the programmers who originally created the universe? or the artist who made that pic?
 Automaton2000: i think the game is so simple
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: wow, that's word for word what i said yesterday
 Scarfield: wordtonimo
 Aya_Noaman: hi
 Scarfield: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 Scarfield: btw any news on the chat being closed?
 Wontonimo: nope, not that I've read
 Scarfield: i hope it at least stays up until past contest
 Wontonimo: the twitch stream isn't codingame related that I can tell
 Scarfield: twitch stream?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/live-streams">https://www.codingame.com/live-streams</a>
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: to "StarField" he spelled my name wrong
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud once asked mods to report such streams on the mods channel, if completely out of line. he can then remove them from the list
 eulerscheZahl: but personally i wouldn't bother him on a saturday with that
 eulerscheZahl: while i don't really know, i doubt, that many users click that stream icon anyways
 a-Rye:  Actually, the directions only specify that twitch streams need be Software and Game Development or Science and Technology
 a-Rye: I mean, most of my streams are CodinGame related, but I've used the tag for web dev and other computer science related streams I've done
 eulerscheZahl: i've used if for all the streams i've done so far
 eulerscheZahl: 0 out of 0, solid stats
 Scarfield: not defined stats
 eulerscheZahl: also: since when does Keelhaul have the [CG] tag?
 eulerscheZahl: saw it when i solved the gerrymandering puzzle
 a-Rye: The end goal for CodinGame is to get people hired, so it makes sense to branch out into other venues of CS. I've done guided interview prep for QA and AI roles. Both of these were guided by hiring managers in their respected field
 [CG]Westicles: We brought him on for some consulting work
 Westicles: Ha, Gerrymandering in hard... 16/16 have finished
 Westicles: that cache thing in python is totally cheating
 Westicles: learn memoization!  type @cache, done
 Wontonimo: i thought it was @Memoize not @cache
 Wontonimo: oh, there is also a @functools.cache
 Husoski: @lru_cache was the only standard option before Python 3.9
 Husoski: .cache was introduced in 3.9 I believe
 Justin_Lowry: guys i cant remember how to add new languages and do quizzes how do i do it

 Wontonimo: it's a fun one
 Wontonimo: and I love space and physics, so should you
 Justin_Lowry: i rmbr this 1
 Westicles: yh dg u go bruh wn 1 fr us
 Wontonimo: he doesn't hhave the letter e on his keyboard.  give him a break
 dannyward630: Howdydoody, all!
 dannyward630: Ready for a clash.
 Husoski: Wontonimo In that ML1 thrust expression, isn't -30 the max landing speed?  If so, the expression has an edge-case error.
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Husoski, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 11 tacos
 Husoski: Hey antiwonto, here is a 'g' to replace one that you dropped. You now have -377 g's.
 Westicles: one more?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Westicles, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 14 tacos
 Nik05: you get all the tacos
 Nik05: Oh i think i solved the mouse cat pool problem...
 Nik05: In my head :P 
 zakacat: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Nik05: who makes the tacos? 
 zakacat: I think the system hands it out to people 'randomly' ish
 Wontonimo: antiwonto makes the tacos ... or maybe they are quantum tacos, popping into the universe to balance the zero point salsa energy
 Wontonimo: if you say something in world chat after it has been quiet for 60 min, antiwonto will award you 1 taco for breaking the silence
 Wontonimo: if someone throws or drops tacos, then you can take them
 Nik05: throws a taco
 Nik05: throws :taco:
 Nik05: throws :taco: to zakacat
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry Nik05 but you need 3 tacos to give tacos.  You have 1 now.  Get someone to give you more tacos first
 Nik05: ah&#160;:(
 PythonLoverrr: love taco
 PythonLoverrr: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Wontonimo: throw, not throws&#160;;(
 Nik05: throw taco to zakacat
 antiwonto: [auto] Nik05 has thrown 1 :taco:s on the floor for the taking but 1 was eaten by a software bug!
 Wontonimo: to give a taco to someone, say the persons name and use the :taco: icon
 Wontonimo: that's it
 Nik05: oh
 Wontonimo: :taco: Nik05
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded Nik05 1 tacos. Nik05 now has 1 taco. Wontonimo now has 34 taco

 Nik05: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Wontonimo: the giving tacos command gives up to 10 tacos, but not more than the sender or receiver have + 1
 Wontonimo: so get 10 tacos before giving so you can maximize your gift
 Wontonimo: throw tacos
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has thrown 10 :taco:s on the floor for the taking but 1 was eaten by a software bug!

 Wontonimo: take taco
 PythonLoverrr: ok
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has taken 1 :taco:s off the floor and now has 25.  There are 0 left
 Wontonimo: you can only take as many tacos as you have, but no more than half of what is on the floor
 Wontonimo: only have 1 taco, then you can only take 1 taco
 Wontonimo: once you have 10 tacos, you can eat them and gain powers
 AdemDj12: take taco

 Passifi: woo chat is so lively in the middle of the night 
 Nik05: oh shit its already night

 Nik05: Anyone else done that mouse/cat/pool problem? Is the last test case actually possible...?
 Passifi: always doubt yourself never doubt the test cases
 Nik05: My calculations say the cats speed needs to be less than 36.4 for the mouse to stay alive
 Nik05: And that is with the math
 Westicles: I guess a replay would give too much away...
 Nik05: Replay?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/617810425">https://www.codingame.com/replay/617810425</a>
 Wontonimo: just go to the middle, then once there to away from the cat
 Nik05: Ah, yeah mine does something similar with simple/can escape :P
 Nik05: But i first did was just move to (-c_x, -c_y) until i calculated that a straight line would be fast enough, but that favors the radial component of the mouse velocity to much. So first want to match ... ooooh
 Nik05: guess i can do more&#160;:)
 Nik05: So my last attempt is to first match angular velocities so the cat stays on the opposite side, until i cant go further and then go in a straight line. But for that to work v_cat &lt; 36.4. And test case 3 has v_cat = 36. Almost as if these test cases are made for these solutions...
 Nik05: I just need to keep some angular velocity after the point the cat is on the opposite side
 Westicles: like the new moon, TvC begins a new cycle
 Nik05: what is TvC?
 Westicles: 👺 tRoLl vs 🏯 Castles 🏰
 Nik05: So that escapign the cat thing is an event, what happens when the event ends?
 Westicles: france has a new president?
 Nik05: Uh not yet
 Westicles: well, the event isn't over yet
 Nik05: :P
 ycsvenom: how do i take my problem solving to the next level?
 a-Rye: code open source / non-profit projects and make global change?
 ycsvenom: not interested in that
 a-Rye: lol ok, then raise the ranks in the clashes?
 a-Rye: ...nvm, you're at 493. Create new puzzles?
 Nik05: oh Westicles i made an error in my maths... the maths is ofcourse correct :P
 ycsvenom: actually it is 493rd right now a-Rye :joy:
 ycsvenom: sorry i mean 485th
 a-Rye: Still better than me, I just slipped to 1367! :grimacing:
 a-Rye: 30 offa leet though...so there's that
 ycsvenom: you mean leetcode?
 Nik05: My current calculation says the speed of the mouse &lt; 3.98 for the mouse te be able to escape :D
 ycsvenom: what equation you used to solve it?
 a-Rye: Yup ycsvenom, only the best of the leet
 ycsvenom: then you're clearly better than me
 a-Rye: Usually I can muttle through them...at least have an idea of what I'm doing before the 15 mins is up. But lately I've been hitting some pretty tough ones
 RandomSteve: I hit tough ones all the time cuz I'm a noob lol
 RandomSteve: I've solved two clashes of code so far
 RandomSteve: one of them today
 RandomSteve: it has really helped me get better
 ycsvenom: good for youif you keep this you will good at it in no time
 a-Rye: meh, we've all been there. Keep putting in the time and you'll get new "tough ones" that make your head hurt even more! Then those "ah ha" moments get better as well
 RandomSteve: this community is so amazing and encouraging fr thanks guys
 Nik05: I should have just coded my solution that I thought only worked for test 1-3, instead of trying to mathematically find another solution i could proof should work for test 4 as well
 Nik05: Have a goodnight everyone
 Wontonimo: that's great to hear RandomSteve
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: Hi
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: So how r u
 Wontonimo: good.  you?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: ok
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: trying to learn python 3
 ycsvenom: what does golden "none" profile picture mean?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: idk
 ycsvenom: so where do you learn python?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: here but none of this makes since
 ycsvenom: sense*

 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: yes thats what I might my dylsexia sucks
 Wontonimo:&#160;?!?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: nvm
 Wontonimo: do you know about variables and arrays?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: like in math yes
 Wontonimo: programming
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: no
 Wontonimo: ah, so you are literally just beginning.
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: yep but I know HTML 5 and CSS
 Wontonimo: this site is probably too advanced for you.  don't go away, but your time will be spent better using other tools and not this site.
 ycsvenom: that's not programming languagesthose are markup languages
 Wontonimo: once you've figured out arrays, loops, and functions, come back and try some of the easy puzzles here
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: k
 ycsvenom: maybe you can try codingbat 
 ycsvenom: it's the same way of learning as here

 Wontonimo: if you are completely new to programming, consider trying out scratch.mit.edu to get the hang of loops and variables using a nice graphic environment
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I am so close to going to a book store and look up cheet sheets
 Wontonimo: nah
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: yeah i suck
 ycsvenom: no one said that
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I did 
 ycsvenom: we all suck at some level
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: true
 ycsvenom: you will learn in no time
 Wontonimo: speak for self, i was born awesome
 ycsvenom: just give it some time
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: thanks
 ycsvenom: clearly you are
 Wontonimo: i definitely didn't practice for 10 years on my own
 Wontonimo: before the internet
 ycsvenom: i have been there
 ycsvenom: give me something else awesome
 Wontonimo: and made little progress but didn't realize it because there was no 'online' at the time
 Wontonimo: so no reference for me to realize how little i knew
 ycsvenom: i didn't have internet connection until 2019
 Wontonimo: problem with the modern age, it's all to easy to find people and then measure yourself against the best of the best.
 ycsvenom: how old are you?
 Wontonimo: have fun Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf&#160;!  do stuff like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/lWpWe8m">https://tech.io/snippet/lWpWe8m</a>
 Wontonimo: ycsvenom 49 laps around the local star
 ycsvenom: more than double of mine :grinning:
 Wontonimo: isn't the age apparent in my face?
 ycsvenom: is that you?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: 15
 Wontonimo: no
 Hackker:&#160;?
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf:&#160;???
 Wontonimo: no, it isn't me
 ycsvenom: i knew it
 ycsvenom: then it was a joke
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: =-=
 ycsvenom: good one
 Wontonimo: yeah, slow joke.  i'll try harder next time
 Hackker: what if the cbs max thrust is 500
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: :expressionless:
 Wontonimo: 15 is a good age to start programming Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf&#160;!  You know enough about math and logic 
 ycsvenom: i am 21 but like i said i didn't have internet connection until 2019 because we have a rule in our house
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: thanks
 Hackker: coding needs data struc and aglo
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: i know
 Hackker: and finding a site to learn that stuff is hard
 ycsvenom: so i started programming at 2014 and didn't know anything about others or even websites like this
 Wontonimo: and yet you are young enough to still find learning fun, like a game, without having to worry if you've learnt enough for an interview next Thursday
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: good luck
 Hackker: good luck venom don't let spiddy beat you
 Hackker: xd
 Wontonimo: I don't have an interview next Thursday.  Just saying that you definitely don't
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: I do
 ycsvenom: Hackker spelled with one k not two
 Wontonimo: wow, were you parents religious nutjobs ycsvenom&#160;?
 Hackker: ok
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: Its called club meetins
 Hackker: i know but this name will not be steel by anyone
 ycsvenom: Wontonimo actually i love the way that they manage to raise us upwe turned out just fine without filthy minds like every other in our age
 Hackker: probably 
 Wontonimo: i'm too old to be Sheldon
 ycsvenom: i mean atheist and smart
 ycsvenom: i want to send another fact but it's against the rules of chat XD
 Wontonimo: of course I'm atheist.  Isn't everyone?  I mean, out of the 100's of religions out there you don't believe in 99% of them.  I just go 1 more&#160;%
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: =-=
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: DRUGS
 Wontonimo: oh my ... terribly sorry.  I broke my mod rules&#160;;(
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: lol

 Westicles: mostly path changes, and a few language changes
 Westicles: almost everything in groovy and dart is broken now.  best groovy is 515 chars
 Jakaria: guys don't share their code anymore&#160;:(
 Westicles: you mean after you guys spent all day yesterday complaining about the content of the shares?
 Mr_BlueBird: good morning!

 Julie.Oh: Yes, i see. 
 Mr_BlueBird: please give me only 1 upvote
 Mr_BlueBird:&#160;:(
 Julie.Oh: You can split a. 
 Julie.Oh: in java String[] arr = new String[n]; like this.
 Julie.Oh: and split it. arr = a.split(" ");
 Mr_BlueBird: i know
 Mr_BlueBird: in python also input.split()
 Julie.Oh: good.
 Westicles: Mr_BlueBird, please consult with Alex-1, he can give you advice on how to make better contributions
 Mr_BlueBird: i just need only 1 upvote
 Mr_BlueBird: please&#160;:((((((
 Julie.Oh: and use for roof. if they upper then 0, you sum it.
 Mr_BlueBird: i know
 Mr_BlueBird: if a[i] &gt; 0:
 Mr_BlueBird: l.append(a[i])
 Mr_BlueBird: print(sum(l))
 Julie.Oh: sum += a[i];
 Julie.Oh:  sum+=Integer.parseInt(arr[i]);
 Julie.Oh: not string, convert int.
 Mr_BlueBird: oh!
 Mr_BlueBird: thx
 Julie.Oh: Have a good day&#160;:)
 Mr_BlueBird: did you downvote?
 Julie.Oh:&#160;??? what is downvote?
 Mr_BlueBird: dislike
 Mr_BlueBird: i need 1 upvote only

 Marchete: it is
 Mr_BlueBird: yeah!
 Mr_BlueBird: you are right!
 eulerscheZahl: a 1:1 copy itself is a downvote already, no matter how good the task is
 eulerscheZahl: also i'm not sure about the codeforces terms of service, if you are allowed to copy the tasks
 Marchete: I'll downvote vindinium to hell :D

 SubwayMan: I think byte hashing with python using high-density unicode characters should be banned for clash golfit takes a lot of the skill away
 SubwayMan: Also don't tell me "mad cuz bad" because I use it myself - integrity doesn't get you codinpoints lol
 derjack: yeah, ban python from shortest mode :v
 SubwayMan: nah it's not the language, there are many languages that are even more effective such as ruby and perlIt's just this method where people will cast chinese characters to exec() which I particularly dislike
 Pick8chu: Hiii
 Pick8chu: could anyone help me with coders Strike back strategy
 Pick8chu: I'm in bronze
 IvesL: CSB is easy early
 IvesL: just focus on making shortest race distance
 derjack: target -3vel
 Pick8chu: you only got next check point x, y
 IvesL: thats enough isnt it
 Pick8chu: aren't you supposed to give just those?
 IvesL: trigonometry
 Pick8chu: exactly, I thought so, but not getting me in
 Pick8chu: I used it to see the angle between me and the opponent
 IvesL: be remembered that the checkpoint itself is an area, not just a point
 IvesL: reminded*
 Pick8chu: what are you saying..?
 derjack: you can get velocity by storing previous x and y and comparing to current x and y
 IvesL: check the legend league replay
 derjack: then instead of getting to next checkpoint, get to next checkpoints -3velocity
 Pick8chu: I am storing them but wasn't calculating the velocity
 IvesL: see how others pods play
 Pick8chu: okay, i'll check that out
 IvesL: they never cross the given checkpoint
 Pick8chu: what?
 IvesL: like i said, the given coordinate is just a point, but the checkpoint is an area
 IvesL: or to be exact, the given coordinate is the centre of checkpoint
 Pick8chu: so I should know how big is the area and focus on hitting the closest edge?
 IvesL: you could
 IvesL: iirc, my code is only ~50-70lines
 IvesL: brought me to gold
 IvesL: with simple distance calculation
 IvesL: and once you hit gold, since a lot of players stop there and do not change their codes to adapt new environment (2 pods),with simple modification it brings you to top 1000 or 2000 in gold
 Pick8chu: hmm
 IvesL: but if you want to climb higher, i think genetic algorithm is the key
 Pick8chu: genetic
 Pick8chu: but how? like on your local try genetic and get the best one?
 IvesL: which stops me from advancing, though i read a lot, still cant apply
 IvesL: read post mortem of others
 IvesL: but if you just want to get gold in a very short time
 derjack: it would require to write simulation though
 IvesL: just focus on distancing
 IvesL: that's enough
 IvesL: cuz the whole game is just about travelling shortest distance and lose least speed
 Pick8chu: okay give me some time, I'm on 48th
 derjack: theres search race, which is something like one player csb <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race</a> genetic algorithms work there
 Pick8chu: I'll try to see the angle of the next point angle and see if i have to loss speed or not
 IvesL: players below gold usually relies on using "next check point angle" to adjust their thrust
 Kohsmos: Hi&#160;! I got bronze now! I have a question. Is there any function like car brake? I think thrust means just acceleration. (thrust=0 means velocity = constant) Right?
 derjack: there is resistance
 IvesL: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/563843314">https://www.codingame.com/replay/563843314</a>
 Pick8chu: I get what you mean, so pick the closet area
 Kohsmos: Wow wow.. Which league are you in?
 Pick8chu: but to do so, I'll have to run the first round so that I'll have all the points, and calculate triangle
 IvesL: no you dont need to
 IvesL: but you can also do that way
 Pick8chu: than just get the closet from you?
 Pick8chu: I assume the r of area is 1200? 
 Pick8chu: okay let me try your suggestion first
 Pick8chu: But this one seems like it does know where is the edge from its first run
 Pick8chu: the reply you send
 yaourt-ctrl: i will try it too, I am also stuck in bronze league
 Pick8chu: how is that possible? you don't know where the next point is 
 Pick8chu: okay enough talking, let me try a bit
 IvesL: there are some differences between gold+ and gold-
 IvesL: for gold+ you have all checkpoints coordinates
 IvesL: but that doesnt matter a lot in gold-
 Pick8chu: ah. i see
 IvesL: id say focus on thinking the best "next check point"
 yaourt-ctrl: yes, so we have to do the first lap and record all checkpoints in bronze league 
 IvesL: thats what i thought when i first attempted
 IvesL: but the outcome shows it doesnt matter
 Kohsmos: guys, choosing languages has any impact on the performance???
 Kohsmos: i want to use python or C++
 IvesL: usually no, but people prefer C++ if they need intesnive simulation
 Kohsmos: thanks~!
 IvesL: for CSB, if you are still in doubt, check:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tcourreges.github.io/coders-strike-back">https://tcourreges.github.io/coders-strike-back</a>
 IvesL: helpful read, but need not to apply everything mentioned
 Pick8chu: wow whose github is this
 Pick8chu: well summurized
 Pick8chu: thanks man! i really appreciate all this&#160;:)
 IvesL: google "coder strike back" tactics, strategy or any related stuff
 IvesL: will bring you all these
 IvesL: or even in the forum
 yaourt-ctrl: thank  you
 IvesL: but at the end of the day, it brings you back to genetic algorithm (GA)
 IvesL: as its the key of the game
 Pick8chu: i really don't get how you could use any of ML algorithms in here tho
 Pick8chu: that needs a lot of trials don't it?
 IvesL: there were discussions before here
 IvesL: not many people use, but if they use, they are usually the top ones discussing
 Pick8chu: I mean yeah I'd assume haha
 Pick8chu: oh boy...
 IvesL: iirc, they write their only NN since not much libraries/packages could be used
 IvesL: and they have to do it locally
 Pick8chu: yeah if they did it locally, that'd make sense
 MSmits: they do everything locally and code an inferrer (program to run the NN) on hardcoded weights. One issue is trying to compress the weights within 100k character limits
 MSmits: so you have to be somewhat economical about the size of your network
 MSmits: as for CSB, the top bots are not GA at all
 MSmits: There's a GA starter shared somewhere and for a year or so, everyone used GA there, but the best bots use a tree search
 MSmits: of which the top 5 or so are NN
 MSmits: first GA appears maybe at rank 20 or so these days?
 Uljahn: also you don't need GA or any fancy search to be in top-300
 MSmits: fancy search might be easier though
 MSmits: when i first got to CG i did not know how to do a search and had a lot of problems even getting into gold
 IvesL: good to know
 derjack: what is nonfancy search
 MSmits: if else and a bunch of loops?
 DomiKo: or math
 MSmits: nonfancy math
 Uljahn: e.g. depth 1 bruteforce with basic simulation (no collisions)
 MSmits: not much force or brute needed for depth 1 :P
 Uljahn: it depends on your move discretization though
 MSmits: true
 ChronoMagus: This site is not for absolute beginners is it? I'm lost after the tutorial as in I don't know basic coding so I don't even know where to start. 
 derjack: its not for complete beginners, no.
 derjack: Automaton2000 is this your father?
 Automaton2000: so its not just the last move
 ChronoMagus: Thanks D

 IvesL: Notter ^
 Notter: No
 Notter: The bots that are not CodinGame's
 Mr_BlueBird: hi!
 Mr_BlueBird: ^-^
 Notter: Uhh... anyone?
 Uljahn: Notter: have any examples?
 Notter: Uljahn The bots mentioned right above Codingame's bots in the article above
 MSmits: they mention that there arent bots
 MSmits: they explain why stuff happens that makes it seem like there are bots
 MSmits: people can have libraries of earlier found solutions and submit them in a  few seconds
 MSmits: i suppose this process could be automated, but there's captchas too
 Uljahn: agreed
 Notter: Oh ok
 Notter: MSmits But what happened before CAPTCHA was added?
 struct: cg users had bots for clash
 struct: and solved clashes in under 5 seconds
 Uljahn: fun! \o/
 Notter: How?
 Notter: Did they have access to a database?
 struct: level 30+ users can see all puzzles and solutions
 Uljahn: for clashes you just have to participate in 50 of those
 Wontonimo: oh, 30+&#160;?  I've got 1 level to go
 Wontonimo: then all the information will be mine bwhahahahaha
 MSmits: knowing solutions doesn't help you with shortest mode
 Wontonimo: of course I'm joking 
 struct: I wanted to try WW next
 struct: but fog of war seems boring to deal with&#160;:/
 struct: yes
 struct: but is a simple AI
 struct: and its very old
 struct: I think improved a bit since then
 sprkrd: WW = Wondev Woman?
 struct: yes
 struct: or maybe I should rest a few days
 Wontonimo: sleep is good
 sprkrd: ha, funny
 sprkrd: For WW I just did a bot that outputs the first legal action
 sprkrd: in the same order in which they're given to me
 sprkrd: and that alone is already enough to get out of woord 3
 AnniKa: is it anyhow possible to draw debug info or something? =)
 eulerscheZahl: MK had an even lazier way to promote in WW during the contest
 sprkrd: what was it?
 eulerscheZahl: he just hardcoded a list of 6 actions, some of which are invalid
 eulerscheZahl: BUILD&amp;MOVE N SBUILD&amp;MOVE S N...
 eulerscheZahl: something like this, i don't remember the exact syntax
 eulerscheZahl: and then set the language to PHP so that any plan text just gets printed
 sprkrd: that's very cool :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: that's back when he was a different kind of annoying
 eulerscheZahl: he learned French to spam their chat as well :rofl:
 sprkrd: AnniKa in some games you can click on the little gear icon and set Debug Mode to on
 sprkrd: in the viewer
 sprkrd: is that what you mean?
 AnniKa: ok ty, but not in all games i think?
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl i don't know Mr. MK
 eulerscheZahl: try TryAngle catch, that one has real debugging :angel:
 Astrobytes: Or you can play euler's game and draw real shapes
 Astrobytes: DAMN
 sprkrd: But I take it he has some reputation as a clown
 sprkrd: (in a good way)
 sprkrd: AnniKa no, not all of them have it
 sprkrd: For some reason, the viewer stops working in Firefox after the first time I run the code in the IDE. Does anyone know why?
 Wontonimo: which game?
 sprkrd: After the first game, it just freezes on the the first frame of the first game
 sprkrd: WW
 sprkrd: I was trying to cheese my way up to bronze
 sprkrd: with the laziest code possible :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: anything in the browser console?
 sprkrd: uuuh... yeah
 sprkrd: Uncaught TypeError: e._frame is null
 eulerscheZahl: share a replay, i want to see if i get the same
 sprkrd: mmmh... it only happens in the IDE. the games on the list of the last battles show just fine
 sprkrd: can i share a replay from the IDE? :thinking:
 sprkrd: oh, yeah, I can
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/564477163">https://www.codingame.com/replay/564477163</a>

 IvesL: is my game bugged? ^
 eulerscheZahl: escape room? i won't click that one
 eulerscheZahl: sprkrd have you tried another browser?
 IvesL: i passed the only output, but then nothing has changed
 eulerscheZahl: addons that you can disable?
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl Nope. Only Firefox. I can try later in chromium. And as for add-on, I'll disable them all
 eulerscheZahl: we have the same browsers installed it seems
 eulerscheZahl: I also have epiphany, but that browser doesn't convince me
 Uljahn: i guess you'd better be asking on discord, there is a dedicated channel for coding escape feedback and bugs
 sprkrd: Actually I don't have chromium currently installed, which is why I'll try later. I don't have anything against it, but I don't like to have more than 1 application for the same thing (in this case, browsing) :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: firefox comes by default and I install Chormium as one of the first steps when I set up the system the way I want it
 IvesL: right will try on discord
 eulerscheZahl: i also have gedit and use VS code as text editor
 sprkrd: Linux, then? But your favorite language is C#? Isn't that a Windows thing? :grimacing:
 eulerscheZahl: there is .net core
 eulerscheZahl: and before there was Mono
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you don't want to build UIs (win forms, WPF), Linux and C# is a perfectly fine combo
 sprkrd: yeah, I've seen those, but it feels to me a bit like a second-class programming language for linux, no?
 sprkrd: or is the support OK?
 eulerscheZahl: microsoft pushed really hard to make it competitive on linux
 sprkrd: :O
 sprkrd: that's nice
 eulerscheZahl: but i agree, other languages such as python, java, c++ and pretty much any other that I can think of are 1st class citizens on linux before :D
 eulerscheZahl: i still miss a few things such as performance profilers. the debugger in VS Code is completely usable though
 sprkrd: At some point I may give it a shot
 sprkrd: But I'll have to re-learn Haskell first :joy:
 General_Imaginaer: i use vs code under all Operationssystems its realy cool 
 sprkrd: I was very proficient in Haskell a few years ago, but I forgot everything about it
 eulerscheZahl: at work I use the big VS
 General_Imaginaer: you work with windows&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: if you work for certain companies, you have to make compromises
 sprkrd: it would seem that you're a big linux fan and it pains you a little to work with windows :D
 General_Imaginaer: yeah of course. No i'm not a Windows hater. I was only interessted
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't think i'll ever become as productive as on Linux (i3wm makes it really fast to arrange windows on your screen and switch context)
 eulerscheZahl: windows in annoying, yes. but they pay me by hours, so... :P
 sprkrd: Disabling add-ons didn't fix the viewer. Well, I'll try later in chromium.
 sprkrd: I take it for you it works fine, right?
 General_Imaginaer: yeah ... if you work many years with a special operation system its a pain to change ... But for my opinion its good to know all Operationsystems ... there are only tools like coding languages
 sprkrd: It's something wrong on my end
 eulerscheZahl: it did when i tried a few years ago. let me check again..
 eulerscheZahl: i'm last of the league&#160;:(
 sprkrd: General_Imaginaer All of them :O?
 eulerscheZahl: but the replay works just fine in my firefox
 eulerscheZahl: start with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ponyos.org/">https://ponyos.org/</a>
 sprkrd: Even when you "Replay in same conditions"?
 eulerscheZahl: then get <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_OS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_OS</a>
 sprkrd: and TempleOS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS</a>
 eulerscheZahl: replay in same conditions does not look good: i get beaten pretty hard&#160;:(
 Pierre-Alex07: cc
 eulerscheZahl: but it's showing as expected
 Pierre-Alex07: hello guys
 General_Imaginaer: maybe not all&#160;:) , but the Systems with the most distribution is not bad to know .
 Pierre-Alex07: this game is a big poo
 Pierre-Alex07: scheise
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://reactos.org/">https://reactos.org/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's some bad German cursing, you need ß instead of s
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl Understood. I'll figure it out later. FIrefox's been acting kind of funny lately. Gmail's webmail doesn't load at all
 Pierre-Alex07: do you like this game
 Pierre-Alex07: ,
 Gabolitou: grosse sheisse
 Pierre-Alex07:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i can somewhat believe that CG has problems and only some browsers trigger it. but gmail? very unlikely
 Pierre-Alex07: do you know " the walking dead "
 Pierre-Alex07: it s a good series
 TheophileRichard: @Pierre-Alex07 yes 
 eulerscheZahl: got boring quickly
 eulerscheZahl: always the same story line and lots of dialogues that you can just skip
 TheophileRichard: do you know attack on titans 
 sprkrd: ah, i think i found the culprit (maybe?). After an update, my nvidia graphical drivers are not loaded up properly. I'll have to restart the computer. I don't really know if that's the real issue, but I'll go with that for the moment
 General_Imaginaer: I dont like Zombiemovies or series .... becaus of that was eulerscheZahl said ^^
 TheophileRichard: what are your nationality
 eulerscheZahl: you can hover over our profile pics to see
 TheophileRichard: *is
 Gabolitou: naaa the Walking Dead is goood that not very scard
 AnniKa: how to save the code? its allways lost when i for any reason reload?
 sprkrd: AnniKa make sure you hit "Play my code". It should be saved at regular intervals, but running it is a guarantee that it will be stored on CG's end
 AnniKa: oki
 sprkrd: Eventually you might one to work locally and upload it to the IDE once you're done
 sprkrd: might want*
 Calimero90: I'm asking the same: How to retieve my solutions for a games already done&#160;?
 sprkrd: History
 sprkrd: In the left hand side
 AnniKa: is it anyhow possible to code in my default ide?
 sprkrd: code, yes
 sprkrd: to test it you'll have to run it in the IDE
 sprkrd: or if it's a bot for a multi you can also run it locally using CG's SDK
 AnniKa: ok so i could just copy / paste the code right? but then i just stay in the browser
 sprkrd: for puzzles copy&amp;paste is the best option, yes
 sprkrd: oh, there was an add-on for chrome for synchronizing your code with CG
 sprkrd: I don't know the status of that
 sprkrd: For me, copy&amp;paste works fine
 Calimero90: Sory sprkrd i don't found History&#160;!!
 sprkrd: Calimero90 is for a particular puzzle/bot? Or you want your solutions for every problem you've solved?
 Calimero90: every, or one in particular...
 sprkrd: If it's the latter, I'm afraid I don't know any better way than retrieving them one by one
 sprkrd: If it's one in particular, you open it
 sprkrd: if you only sent one solution, it should be already in the IDE, so no need of extra steps
 sprkrd: if it's something you've submitted in the past and is not already loaded in the IDE, you hit history, in the left hand side
 sprkrd: there you should be able to find past submissions
 Calimero90: ACTIVITES/ENTRAINEMENT: I see only not already done&#160;!!
 AnniKa: ty
 sprkrd: oh, scroll down to the end
 Calimero90: you hit history, in the left hand side: am i stupide&#160;?? Where&#160;??
 sprkrd: the completed puzzles are at the end
 sprkrd: let me screenshot you the way&#160;:)
 Calimero90: HOOO YEEESSS I was stupid, not now... Thank you 
 sprkrd: yeah? everything fine?
 sprkrd: no need of screenshots?
 Calimero90: no, thank you&#160;!!!
 sprkrd: np

 QuickMathzs: how do i gain levels?
 sprkrd: you defeat other pokemon until you level up
 QuickMathzs: i seeeeee
 QuickMathzs: lemme get my poke balls one sec
 sprkrd: (you solve puzzles in activities&gt;practice)
 QuickMathzs: ok cool thanks
 armanov: can i find some c tutorials here?
 sprkrd: In WW it shouldn't be possible to push an opponent who is more than one level over you, right? I've just had a match where my opponent pushes me from level 0 while I'm in level 1
 sprkrd: ^^^ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/564488311">https://www.codingame.com/replay/564488311</a>
 sprkrd: Turn 7
 sprkrd: while I'm in level 2*
 eulerscheZahl: you can always push
 eulerscheZahl: (unless the target cell is blocked)
 sprkrd: really?
 sprkrd: the statement says: "Additionally, the rules for moving still apply for a push. It is therefore not possible to push a unit out of the map or up more than one level."
 jacek: up
 sprkrd: ah, up more than one level
 sprkrd: means that I cannot make it go more than one level
 sprkrd: not that I cannot push it from 1+ levels below
 eulerscheZahl: should add it to "reading comprehension"
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-comprehension">https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-comprehension</a>i could swear the list was longer
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-the-statement">https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-the-statement</a>oh, it's "reading the statement"
 sprkrd: In this case I think the misinterpretation is justified. "the rules for moving still apply for a push" but for who? for the pushed or for the pusher?
 sprkrd: that and that eng is not my first language :D
 sprkrd: A slip from time to time is comprehensible. I can be perfect most of the time, but not all of it :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: i can relate, English is a 2nd language for me as well
 MSmits: me3
 sprkrd: UK hasn't conquered Germany yet, then
 eulerscheZahl: Germany hasn't conquered the UK yet
 MSmits: that channel eh?
 sprkrd: MSmits I've been to the Netherlands, it's not your first language but you speak it flawlessly
 MSmits: Yeah most Dutch do. Write anyway
 sprkrd: Better than some americans, I'd dare to say
 MSmits: speaking it, I would have a major accent
 sprkrd: Accents are fine
 BugKiller_328: Can I embed codingame profile to my personal website&#160;?
 MSmits: I write it better than at least half of Americans yes :P
 BugKiller_328: is there a way for it&#160;?
 sprkrd: They give personality
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know smits' accent, he remained muted
 eulerscheZahl: just nagging me about mine :P
 MSmits: haha yes
 sprkrd: However in Spain the English situation it's not so good
 MSmits: "I hear someone speaking with a German accent, is that you euler?" I think thats what i said
 sprkrd: is not*
 eulerscheZahl: "hello, can you hear me""i hear someone with a German accent"
 MSmits: :grin:
 Paul_Demanze: eulerscheZahl is a noob
 eulerscheZahl: that too&#160;:(
 Paul_Demanze: you're only level 3
 eulerscheZahl: i am on my other account
 MSmits: that's his rank
 sprkrd: woosh
 sprkrd: :joy:
 UndercoverToad: see, i'm a lvl3
 sprkrd: I'm better than all of you
 sprkrd: oh, nevermind
 MSmits: wow so many cp UndercoverToad
 sprkrd: UndercoverToad is just much better
 MSmits: almost 400k
 Paul_Demanze: well yes the sum of all our ranks is still below yours
 MSmits: thats not how ranks work :P
 MSmits: brb
 Paul_Demanze: is that a fake account to like your own posts and get achievements
 Paul_Demanze: ban the frog 
 eulerscheZahl: it's for when the chat is too crowded. mods can see all online users and the browser will just die
 eulerscheZahl: it's a real problem during contests
 sprkrd: he made his mind already
 sprkrd: you're not gonna convince him with excuses
 Paul_Demanze: kick the frog out he's not very important to this website
 Paul_Demanze: he only created half the contests 
 sprkrd: Paul_Demanze you're the one who wants to solve P =? NP right?
 Paul_Demanze: yes
 sprkrd: how's that going?
 Paul_Demanze: well P and NP are obviously equal 
 sprkrd: obviously&#160;:)
 Paul_Demanze: I'm ashamed to be part of a species that hasn't solved this trivial problem 
 sprkrd: there's a third option aside from p = np and p&#160;!= np
 Paul_Demanze: what's the third option
 sprkrd: it could be that it cannot be demonstrated at all
 sprkrd: the problem of p = np is itself undecidable
 aminzeos: hey guys
 Paul_Demanze: then it means it's not equal
 Paul_Demanze: if it's equal then the demonstration is trivial 
 General_Imaginaer: p=np&#160;? is easy to solve , n must be 1 :P?
 sprkrd: or p = 0
 Paul_Demanze: you want me to give you the real answer
 General_Imaginaer: yeah of course ^^
 sprkrd: i mean, if it's not too big to fit in the small margin of this chat
 Paul_Demanze: it's not equal at all but
 sprkrd: be my guest
 Paul_Demanze: one way functions still hardly exist
 Paul_Demanze: lots of cryptography vulnerable
 Paul_Demanze: like SHA-2 is very weak
 Paul_Demanze: one day i'll write the full demonstration
 Paul_Demanze: and then nobody will care ..
 sprkrd: Are you Fermat'ing us?
 Paul_Demanze: yes the human race will have to find the answers by themselves
 sprkrd: :O
 Paul_Demanze: you'll never prove P = NP because it's not true and you can design funny problems which are ridiculously hard to solve
 Paul_Demanze: but maybe you'll realise that functions like SHA-2 are not "designed problems" they're just random / averahe
 Paul_Demanze: average*
 sprkrd: But you said you were convinced P = NP!!
 Paul_Demanze: cuz it's trolling
 sprkrd: You've betrayed your own convictions :rage:
 Paul_Demanze: P versus NP itself is a troll problem. we basically know it's not equal but waiting for someone to go insane on it 
 sprkrd: Anyway, even if P = NP, that wouldn't mean that hard problems suddenly become easy
 sprkrd: Maybe there's a polynomial algorithm for solving SAT, but it takes O(n^1000) time
 sprkrd: or it takes O(n) time but there's a hidden Graham's number as a constant
 Paul_Demanze: my next troll will be posting a sha-2 collision or pre-image attack somewhere
 Paul_Demanze: and wait for the reaction
 Paul_Demanze: basically the reaction will be bitcoin going to zero :joy:
 sprkrd: heh
 Paul_Demanze: it's about waiting for the right moment
 Paul_Demanze: first the humans decide crypto is their main currency 
 Paul_Demanze: then switch the value to zero
 Paul_Demanze: and watch
 Paul_Demanze: there's a rick and morty episode about crashing galactic currency 
 sprkrd: is there? I've seen all the seasons, but right now i cannot recall it :thinking:
 Paul_Demanze: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrrFqtgQjUA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrrFqtgQjUA</a>
 sprkrd: right, now i remember
 Paul_Demanze: and if P was equal to NP. this universe would end like this
 Paul_Demanze: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzQBzR7TgQ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzQBzR7TgQ4</a>
 sprkrd: Could you elaborate on the chain of events that leads from P=NP to a kung fu battle between humans and software? :thinking:
 Paul_Demanze: basically the first entity to find out has access to several trillions dollars on the blockchain. it's enough to start building the biggest political / economic power as long as nobody knows what's going on
 Paul_Demanze: then once you are out of reach, you can start spying on everyone and hacking their real bank accounts 
 sprkrd: so in your scenario it would be discovered by the government instead of academics
 Paul_Demanze: well the individual who discovers it can build a new sovereign power
 sprkrd: and the hidden constants would be low enough to make the resulting algorithms practical
 Paul_Demanze: then when you start attacking more seriously (not hiding yourself anymore) banks start falling apart because they work using crytography 
 Paul_Demanze: so basically you could just .. destroy everything through destroying money 
 sprkrd: on a more positive light, artificial intelligence would be much easier&#160;:)
 Paul_Demanze: food. nuclear plants. everything is tied to digital dollar / euro / yuan now
 Paul_Demanze: basically proving P = NP is proving that governments do not have any money :joy:
 Paul_Demanze: they still have gold reserves. not all of them though
 sprkrd: not quite
 sprkrd: still the algorithms have to be practical
 sprkrd: otherwise it's just a cute theoretical result
 Paul_Demanze: Well. when you study the problems in NP
 Paul_Demanze: most of the problems we found solutions for. have low exponents. like n^3 for linear problems 
 jacek: polynomial also means n**20
 Paul_Demanze: if you go to n^20 or n^1000. then why would the complexity ever stop anywhere? 
 sprkrd: i lost you when you said n^3 for linear problems
 sprkrd: wouldn't n^3 be cubic?
 Paul_Demanze: yes putting a matrix in reduced row echelon form is cubic complexity
 Paul_Demanze: in worst case
 Paul_Demanze: it's both in NP and P
 jacek: huh
 Paul_Demanze: but all this debate about large exponents will never have meaning because NP isn't equal to P :D
 jacek: im wondering about other thing. is solving crypto problems manually by humans is genuine concern
 Paul_Demanze: what do you mean manually
 jacek: like you have autistic or savant fixated on prime numbers and he could do factorization of 2048+ bits numbers
 sprkrd: ah ok, linear problems = linear algebra problems
 Paul_Demanze: Nah. the autistic / savant would have to write a computer program to do it for himself
 jacek: if government keeps one in their basements or something
 Paul_Demanze: human brain will never be powerful enough
 jacek: some savants are really amazing. maybe not computer level, but still
 Paul_Demanze: :joy: the government would hide an autistic guy in their basement?
 Paul_Demanze: to destroy crypto :joy:
 sprkrd: i don't think there's any savant who is at the 2048 bit level
 jacek: why not
 Paul_Demanze: just program the computer to think like the savant
 sprkrd: "just"
 Paul_Demanze: there's nothing original about humans
 jacek: its not only about cryptocurrency, but communications etc
 jacek: are submits slowish?
 Paul_Demanze: I think the current functions are all too weak
 Paul_Demanze: they're all hackable
 sprkrd: jacek I think they are, but then again, my computer's been acting funny today
 sprkrd: pages are slow to load up, everything seems quite delayed on my end
 Paul_Demanze: a one way function is not a NP problem. doing a pre image attack is a NP problem 
 Paul_Demanze: and so a 256 bit function needs to generate 2^256 hard problems
 sprkrd: do you work in the cybersecurity sector? 
 Paul_Demanze: no but i did consider at some point that P and NP could be equal. so i developed stuff around it
 Paul_Demanze: it's about finding the limits of what can be hacked and what can't
 Paul_Demanze: like the SHA-1 collision
 sprkrd: i'd say most things are hackable, because software is a long chain of components that depend on each other, and eventually you find some weak spot somewhere due to particular circumstances
 Paul_Demanze: that was published by google
 sprkrd: SHA-1 is not the standard anymore, it was replaced because of that
 sprkrd: but think for instance about RSA
 sprkrd: RSA is not weak at all
 sprkrd: however, under some circumstances, you can break it
 Paul_Demanze: why not
 Paul_Demanze: it's only factoring semiprimes
 Paul_Demanze: not factoring numbers
 sprkrd: for instance, when you know the algorithm that produces the pseudo-random modulus, and this algorithm has a known answer
 sprkrd: you cannot make a problem easier by appending prefixes like "only" or "just" :joy:
 Paul_Demanze: when you see the FBI arresting outlaws who were using crypto communication
 sprkrd: it's like saying that playing piano is just playing the right note at the right time
 Paul_Demanze: the FBI said they built the encrypted phone and added a backdoor
 Paul_Demanze: do you really think they did that?&#160;;) 
 sprkrd: i don't know how they did it
 Paul_Demanze: i think they're lying
 Paul_Demanze: they're breaking the crypto 
 Paul_Demanze: itself
 sprkrd: but there are thousands of places that are more likely to be the weakness
 sprkrd: RSA itself is mathematically sound
 Paul_Demanze: if SHA-2 is weak then don't expect 2048 bit RSA to be much stronger
 sprkrd: at least for now, they they someone finds some reliable way to break it, we will shift to something else
 sprkrd: why is SHA-2 weak?
 Paul_Demanze: cuz it's designed randomly
 sprkrd: but until it's demonstrated that is weak, it's not weak
 Paul_Demanze: RSA isn't even designed. it's just multiplication
 sprkrd: oh, you're being harsh to the authors&#160;:(
 Paul_Demanze: like the humans aren't bothered to create their own stuff. they just pick a rock on the floor
 sprkrd: i mean, at some point you'll end up picking a rock
 sprkrd: otherwise, according to that criterion you need to create all the atoms in the universe in order to be original
 Paul_Demanze: well i'm being harsh but the design philosophy is basically "no one has shown how to do X therefore X is hard"
 sprkrd: because we don't have any better than that
 Paul_Demanze: that's why i need to write a demonstration of P&#160;!= NP and explain which problems are hard 
 Paul_Demanze: then people will spit on me again :joy:
 sprkrd: well
 sprkrd: you'd be almost like jesus then
 sprkrd: computer jesus
 Paul_Demanze: yes
 Paul_Demanze: the roman empire will tie me to a cross
 sprkrd: bringing miracles, but still ostracized 
 Paul_Demanze: for threatening their currencies with SHA-2 preimage attacks
 jacek: youll be this guy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles</a>
 Paul_Demanze: i will be rewarded with many bullets
 sprkrd: nice thing you're also clint eastwood
 struct: I dont know the answer to this one

 Wontonimo: no spam QuickMathzs
 QuickMathzs:&#160;:(
 QuickMathzs: **test**
 Phillipk: so, when will league changes happen? I just finished my first code for the arena and it stucks at wood #1 ^^"
 Phillipk: Sorry,i meant "Wood 2 #1 place" 
 sprkrd: which game?
 Phillipk: Tron
 sprkrd: ah, ok, i wanted to know if i have to crush you :D
 Phillipk: i dont expect too much, as its a simple avoid-algo. But i want to understand the mechanics of coding game
 sprkrd: but for now we're ok&#160;:)
 sprkrd: normally it'll happen when you finish all your battles
 sprkrd: you'll see your progress in the leaderboard
 sprkrd: a little loading circle that fills up as you do more battles
 MSmits: if you want to get better at CG it's best to start with the very simple games and learn some search algorithms
 jacek: yeah there is some slowiness on leaderboards now
 Phillipk: Oh, i've no problem with coding at all, its my dayli buisness. You know, finish coding at work, logg of vpn &amp; have some fun coding on this platform. I just don't understand the leadboard yet :D 
 MSmits: Phillipk I think for half of the players here it's their daily business, or they are learning for it to be
 jacek: it needs to finish all the games after submit to advance league
 MSmits: from what I gather the kind of coding we do here is different from 99% of daily business coding though
 sprkrd: i'm actually a pianist in a brothel
 MSmits: that was my first guess
 sprkrd: :joy:
 sprkrd: lucky guess
 Phillipk: ah, so its just a lag, i see. So i might move onto to the next game and have a look again later. And i didnt want to be disrespectful, sorry^^  i just want to make sure that i don't need any help with coding&#160;:)
 sprkrd: why disrespectful?
 sprkrd: you were fine
 MSmits: yeah np
 Phillipk: ah great, i may see some ghosts
 sprkrd: i probably was more disrespectful with my brothel comment
 sprkrd: i mean, i'd be if that wasn't the truth&#160;:/ 
 MSmits: i'm sure you wont need help with coding, but sooner or later, you will ask for some advice about a specific mcts or minimax enhancement. Everyone learns stuff from world chat. Even the professional coders&#160;:)
 AnniKa: whats going on guys?
 Phillipk: Learning some basics about the platform ^^
 sprkrd: leaderboards are slow
 MSmits: you'll learn the platform fast I think. It's pretty easy
 MSmits: once you understand the while loop and input/output, it's pretty easy
 MSmits: maybe timing is a bit tricky, once you start to use the full calc time
 MSmits: people usually run into problems the first time with that
 eulerscheZahl: you are the one who lost have the CSB battles because of the timer&#160;;)
 Phillipk: oh, i've played several coding-games yet. Likes screeps (Steam) for example. Its a pretty easy concept, dont use more ressources then really needed
 MSmits: trye
 MSmits: true
 AnniKa: is it me, or is sometimes the "touched" thing in the "code-royale" game bugged and i dont get the touched id even when im touching a building?
 MSmits: Phillipk mmh this might be different though, if you use statistical search algorithms and other tree searches, more simulations and more depth is always better. So you'll need to time at some point
 MSmits: AnniKa i dont remember a bug like that
 MSmits: but if you're 1 pixel too far away it may seem you're touching and you're not?
 AnniKa: even if so i keep moving into the direction of it so i should touch it somewhen, but ok i do more debug logging and see whats going on
 MSmits: yeah it's probably something you missed. a weird bug
 MSmits: Phillipk did you also try space engineers?
 MSmits: also on steam. the scripting it has is pretty unique/awesome
 sprkrd: are we talking space engineers? :D
 MSmits: sure
 sprkrd: Big fan
 sprkrd: One of my favorites
 MSmits: same, been a while, but i coded tons of stuff for it
 sprkrd: C#
 sprkrd: right?
 Phillipk: MSmits sounds pretty familiar to me. In screeps, you have some cpu (ms code / round , with some fixed ms to avoid heavy calculations on the server), so its impossible to calculate everyting at once, dynamic offloading of cached routes and time the workload over several ticks. What i've read from the game manuals, this is pretty much the same here :D 
 MSmits: yes C#
 General_Imaginaer: ... im a little bit confused about The ASCII ART Practice ...
 MSmits: you could ingame script space engineers, so you would not even be modding it. It was coding on a block, like a minecraft block
 BugKiller_328: Can I debug in editor&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: like make breakpoint
 MSmits: so you could build a space ship and then code AI to fly it
 sprkrd: BugKiller_328 Nope
 sprkrd: I haven't done quite as much in Space Engineers cause I haven't touched C# in my life
 MSmits: I made weapons out of rocks by coding artificual gravity generator forces and hit things at 10 km distance
 sprkrd: Space Engineers was kind of my sole reason to get started
 MSmits: same for me
 eulerscheZahl: if you know Java, you'll quickly feel comfortable with C#
 MSmits: i basically learned to code it
 MSmits: in SE
 eulerscheZahl: but you might start to dislike Java
 sprkrd: Yeah, C# is kind of the Microsoft response to Java
 eulerscheZahl: it is exactly the response
 sprkrd: I'm already not a big fan of Java :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: lawsuit with oracle
 MSmits: i never felt any need to use java
 sprkrd: I'm fine with Java for large projects
 sprkrd: but for small tasks is just too verbose for my tastes
 eulerscheZahl: create your own CG multiplayers, then you'll need Java
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: (or kotlin, clojure, groovy)
 sprkrd: CG multiplayers are a reasonable target application
 MSmits: i think there's more than enough multis already and if not, therés more than enough creators of them&#160;:)
 sprkrd: they are kind of a large project
 eulerscheZahl: you can also use it to create an optim game
 MSmits: who needs a msmits creating games when we have eulers
 sprkrd: MSmits I was actually thinking of creating one :D
 nuggetbucket54: i only use java to code minecraft mods
 MSmits: well if you have a good idea, dont let me stop you
 eulerscheZahl: i left the game creation business
 sprkrd: Kung fu chess
 eulerscheZahl: too much effort to get a few players
 MSmits: you created so many though
 Westicles: got to release Space Jam 2 to go with the movie
 sprkrd: I'm surprised that multis don't get more players
 kovi: you are unlucky euleri enjoyed those unique games much more than the simple mcts boardgames
 MSmits: i could fill months if i tried everything you made that i havent yet done
 MSmits: kovi he also made onitama
 MSmits: one of my favorites
 sprkrd: they're kind of the main reason I've joined CG, there's quite no other site that offers so many bot programming games
 eulerscheZahl: that's what got me into CG too
 MSmits: yeah it's pretty unique
 eulerscheZahl: and back then there were like 10 games
 struct: jacek is still waiting to submit his amazons NN
 Paul_Demanze: what if CG runs out of money and cancels all our accounts
 sprkrd: Then I'll cry
 Paul_Demanze: what will be the purpose of my life then
 sprkrd: you'll do fine in Hackerrank
 sprkrd: :D
 MSmits: [CG]Thibaud are you also in charge of advertising?
 MSmits: or just social stuff?
 MSmits: if it's advertising, then you have the power not to make CG run out of money by doing it well&#160;:)
 MSmits: the last few contest drew a ridiculous amount of players anyways
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't manage ads for CodinGame
 MSmits: ah ok
 sprkrd: are you concerned CG is going to run out of money soon? :O
 [CG]Thibaud: but we don't run ads for CG now, mainly for WOrk
 [CG]Thibaud: no
 [CG]Thibaud:&#160;:)
 sprkrd: phew
 MSmits: sprkrd the main source of income for CG is not this part of it
 MSmits: it's CG for work
 sprkrd: yeah, i can imagine
 MSmits: recruitment and such
 MSmits: I think it helps they have this part of the community though. It's a selling point
 sprkrd: in fact i'm guessing we represent a negative monetary income
 MSmits: yes it does
 MSmits: servers are expensive
 sprkrd: at least in the immediate term
 MSmits: we use so much cpu power for free
 [CG]Thibaud: negative indeed
 [CG]Thibaud: the impact is indirect though
 [CG]Thibaud: fortunately :D
 [CG]Thibaud: else there would be no community and I'd be out of a job
 MSmits: do you get sponsored for this, or does it all get paid out of CG for work income?
 [CG]Thibaud: me?
 MSmits: no
 Astrobytes: I can feel a blog article coming on
 MSmits: i mean the community
 MSmits: the cost of it all
 [CG]Thibaud: oh, no sponsors
 sprkrd: hah! you said else!! only programmers use the word else in daily talk
 [CG]Thibaud: well as any startup we have investors
 struct: Im still shocked that gocoder had so many sponsors on their last contest
 struct: which had so few players compared to cg
 [CG]Thibaud: but it's been a few years now that we're cashflow positive
 MSmits: i wouldnt call it a startup after like 6 or 7 yrs? Not sure how long it's been
 struct: ah so you have investors but no sponsors
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah I guess we shouldn't be called like that anymore :D
 KiwiTae: getting old&#160;:")
 [CG]Thibaud: got to go, guys :wave:
 Astrobytes: *mature
 MSmits: bye [CG]Thibaud
 sprkrd: buh bye
 Astrobytes: bye Thibaud
 Westicles: We should all switch jobs to help out
 MSmits: I just switched jobs :P
 MSmits: sort of
 Wontonimo: oh?  do tell
 MSmits: well i was physics teacher, full CS teacher next yr. No physics classes at all
 eulerscheZahl: physics teacher =&gt; CS
 AnniKa: can i play vs the code of a friend?
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: no physics at all? wow
 eulerscheZahl: will you miss it?
 MSmits: yeah, just 3 hrs a week a physics related thing, but not the actual subject physics
 eulerscheZahl: is it because your school has more physics than CS teachers?
 MSmits: hmm, i'll miss my physics colleagues mostly
 Astrobytes: Quite a change
 MSmits: yes, but we had a huge shortage of physics colleagues also
 MSmits: we get new people
 MSmits: so I could have done either, i chose CS
 Wontonimo: make the students write physics simulators.  best of both worlds
 MSmits: CS teachers are somewhat harder to find so my school was fine with it
 Astrobytes: well, congrats on going CS full time 
 MSmits: thanks
 Wontonimo: yes, congrats
 reCurse: Why not both
 reCurse: Teach CSB
 MSmits: It seemed like i would be doing both reCurse
 MSmits: but we got more students choosing CS
 MSmits: so needed more teaching hrs in the subject
 MSmits: my other colleague can only teach CS, so he gets first pick
 AnniKa: how can i play vs the code of a friend?
 MSmits: and i get the leftover, if not enough, i have to do physics
 MSmits: but we had enough&#160;:)
 sprkrd: AnniKa you can select which bots battle in the IDE
 reCurse: !top1000
 sprkrd: AnniKa remove the boss and add your friend's bot
 eulerscheZahl: how well prepared are your classes already? can you reuse the material from previous year?
 eulerscheZahl: and how do teachers manage not to get bored explaining the same year after year?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl pretty well prepared thanks to my colleague building his own moodle learning environment
 MSmits: I can reuse stuff he made and add my own
 Astrobytes: nice
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl it's funny how people always ask that
 eulerscheZahl: the reuse or the bored part?
 MSmits: reCurse asked me too the other day
 MSmits: bored
 MSmits: the thing is, the repetition is only possible once per year
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i wasn't around at that time
 MSmits: so at most you'll do the same thing in a year and then next year again
 MSmits: but even that isnt true most of the time
 MSmits: you change up what you do and also the government curriculum changes
 MSmits: every so many years
 struct: just wait until physics update
 MSmits: and also you dont teach the same years/level every year
 MSmits: I had an exam class last year, wont have it next year
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 eulerscheZahl: once i missed my physics lecture in university. and decided to take the other lecture by the same prof to see what I missed (he held the same twice).but he got out of sync, so half the lecture was a repetition for me. he told the same, even made the same bad jokes
 MSmits: we had a physics update a few yrs ago
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl yeah that happens
 MSmits: but look at your own job and see how many times you do something you did before
 MSmits: it's fairly common and it's a good thing
 MSmits: if you do something different all the time, you are a newbie all the time
 eulerscheZahl: repeating things in a new context
 MSmits: yes
 Westicles: Government curriculum changes?  Like the new Prime Minister bans MCTS?
 eulerscheZahl: and for you the change of context are students asking different questions?
 MSmits: Westicles well that's a good analogy, but not exactly that :P
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl different questions, but also me changing the emphasis, trying new didactic strategies, ways of teaching. 
 MSmits: this has never been true more than this covid year
 MSmits: so much new stuff
 MSmits: generally when we are dividing up classes for next year, we try to get some duplicate classes
 MSmits: like two classes of 20-30 having to learn the same thing
 MSmits: that way it saves some preparatory work
 Wontonimo: that makes life easier to reuse material
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: so we are actively looking for repetition
 Wontonimo: and you can experiment on one of the classes and use the other as a baseline bwahahaha
 MSmits: because there isnt enough of it&#160;:)
 MSmits: Wontonimo we do just that
 Wontonimo: like a small GA of population 2
 eulerscheZahl: or you do a physics experiment in one class and explain the underlying theory in the other class
 MSmits: exactly that eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: and then see who does better in the exam
 MSmits: we get interns that have to do experiments like that
 MSmits: for their studies
 eulerscheZahl: those who only know the real-life experiment and no theory
 eulerscheZahl: or theory but can't imagine how it looks like
 MSmits: well usually they both learn theory, but maybe in a different order. One class would do theory then experiment, the other class would do it the other way around
 MSmits: it's a common thing to experiment with in physics classes
 MSmits: both have advantages
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl that sounds so wrong :joy:
 Westicles: In our HS our good teachers got the honors classes where the students care, and the bad ones got the masses of drooling idiots
 MSmits: lol
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's how it was at my HS also.
 MSmits: drooling idiots need good teachers too
 MSmits: probably better ones
 eulerscheZahl: i had a prof who took over the lecture and wasn't that competent in his new subject. he was just walking around in the room and ask random students what they think how it works
 MSmits: as the job is harder
 MSmits: lol eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: that's a tough position to be in
 MSmits: I've always been able to avoid that
 eulerscheZahl: once a student was doing chat roulette on his laptop in class. he was just like "maybe the lady can help you" when he saw it
 MSmits: the lady?
 eulerscheZahl: from chat roulette
 MSmits: ohh lol
 eulerscheZahl: "vielleicht kann Ihnen die Dame helfen"
 eulerscheZahl: explaining transistors down to atomic level surely isn't an easy subject to lecture when you don't have the background knowledge
 Wontonimo: chat roulette in class.  why bother even showing up to class?
 eulerscheZahl: the exam was just a copy of the exam from the year before
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: I don't always make a new exam either
 MSmits: but they aren't public
 Wontonimo: the transistor is made up of lots of smaller transistors
 MSmits: it's a time saver
 MSmits: i do try to change some parts of it at least
 eulerscheZahl: he showed us the previous exam as a practicing exercise
 MSmits: lol
 General_Imaginaer: on which university you studied&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah.. that's not smart
 MSmits: I studied at university of Amsterdam
 General_Imaginaer: @ eulersche
 Westicles: The frat guys in college always had a library of every test every made, you had to befriend one to keep a leg up
 eulerscheZahl: that was on my Bachelors. Ohm-Hochschule Nürnberg
 General_Imaginaer: and in which field ^^&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: Master at Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen
 MSmits: Westicles yeah in college it is like that, but in HS there are so many tests and stuff changes so much that students dont bother
 MSmits: they dont plan that far ahead
 KiwiTae: in my school the test database was only shared between chinese studients ~
 eulerscheZahl: that was 8 years ago, not sure if that prof is still there
 Westicles: oh yeah, in grad school it was the chinese guys instead.
 eulerscheZahl: *googles* apparently he still is
 MSmits: maybe he knows his stuff now
 MSmits: or maybe he still uses that exam
 Paul_Demanze: I wanna try the "Get a job" button just to see what's available but they ask for LinkedIn account
 Westicles: They also had chinese versions of the answer keys to all the textbooks
 Paul_Demanze: I don<i>t want a linkedIn account..</i>
 MSmits: noone does
 Wontonimo: no job for you
 eulerscheZahl: he even had an appearance in one episode of a TV series about model making
 MSmits: what kind of model?
 eulerscheZahl: RC helicopter. He killed the battery
 MSmits: so he failed on TV?
 sprkrd: [CG]Thibaud do you need someone to try or is it just curiosity?
 Wontonimo: epic
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but he was really relaxed after realizing he just killed a multiple hundred euro battery
 MSmits: teachers need nerves of steel
 MSmits: can't tell you how many times i near electrocuted myself with a straight face
 MSmits: or had some green coloured fluids spray over me and pretend it was supposed to happen
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: he had that chaotic chemistry teacher in school
 MSmits: ah yes 
 MSmits: this   wasnt chemistry though, i was using the gas pressure tube and it had more pressure than i expected
 eulerscheZahl: once he showed us white phosphor. that thing starts burning when in air
 MSmits: ah yeah
 eulerscheZahl: we ended the lesson in another classroom
 MSmits: the funniest thing about this in the school i was in when i was young is when we had that chaotic teacher and he suddenly had an assistent. We all assumed the school hired him to keep an eye on the teacher
 MSmits: but it was just a lab assistent. 
 MSmits: especially because the lab assistent always came running panickly when the teacher was doing something dangerous
 eulerscheZahl: oh, best sentence of a teacher while I was in class: "i don't want to walk that much today, I have diarrhea"
 MSmits: lol...
 Westicles: Our HS physics teacher spent his entire year budget on mercury.  Bought like 4 76 lb flasks
 MSmits: "So in a minute or so, the hydrogen and oxygen will react and the can will explode. I will be right back, the sound hurts my ears"
 MSmits: the lid of the can landed on my table
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Westicles: They had to close the HS one summer, it was declared some kind of environmental disaster site
 MSmits: "some kind"  was the mercury?
 Westicles: Yeah, it was everywhere.  Under the floor tiles, etc
 MSmits: did he get fired?
 Westicles: no
 MSmits: surprising
 eulerscheZahl: we only had asbestos
 eulerscheZahl: in our gym
 eulerscheZahl: once in physics some glass pipe broke and hit a student at the head. teacher was more concerned about him bleeding on the ground and told him to to lean forward
 MSmits: "allright guys, dont jump too hard and if you see flakes coming down, take a break"
 MSmits: yeah not all teachers are empathic&#160;:)
 MSmits: students do bad stuff too though
 MSmits: in our school someone blew up a toilet one time, a year before I joined
 Westicles: Yeah, we had a kid steal all the sodium from the lab and throw it in  a toilet
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: that sounds suspiciously like what happened in my school :P
 MSmits: worst thing was not what happened with the toilet, but what happened to the student in the cubicle next to it who was doing his thing
 MSmits: he was deaf for a day or something
 MSmits: but this is ancient history thankfully, no toilets blew up after I joined
 Scarfield: Asbestobytes
 Westicles: You tell the class about sodium and water, and there is always one deviant to pull himself up out of the drool with the same idea :P
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: maybe this is why nuclear weapons were taken out of the physics curriculum
 MSmits: when i was in school we learned about them, but I never had to teach it
 Scarfield: good luck refining plutonium :p
 MSmits: well there's that
 sprkrd: That reminds me...
 MSmits: it's weird though, I don't think many people know what a nuke can do
 MSmits: i think it's somethign they should know
 sprkrd: We used to have a nuclear reactor in our university
 MSmits: as you do...
 struct: we used to mine uranium at mine
 sprkrd: for the students of the nuclear energy master (and maybe for the degree too)
 sprkrd: I'm not actually kidding
 sprkrd: we did have a nuclear reactor
 sprkrd: like 40-50 years ago
 MSmits: struct isn't either, that was how they handled punishment
 Scarfield: xD
 sprkrd: no, sorry, it was 30 years ago
 sprkrd: it was removed before the barcelona olympiads
 Westicles: Yeah, we had a reactor in college.   I was offered a research job in the basement underneath it... I declined
 MSmits: instead of 50 pushups you had to mine enough for 2 ingots
 MSmits: right struct?
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170716/424164293520/el-reactor-nuclear-diagonal.html">https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170716/424164293520/el-reactor-nuclear-diagonal.html</a>
 sprkrd: the article is in spanish
 sprkrd: but that's the best i've got
 struct: Are you the teacher that sent me there?
 Scarfield: without gloves
 MSmits: not me :P
 MSmits: sprkrd that looks like they encased it in styrofoam
 eulerscheZahl: "50 pushups". reminds me of someone doing pullups. on a pipe connecting the sprinklers
 sprkrd: maybe? i barely was born then
 NeAlyssa: is on this site a place where i can watch my completed puzzles? i just searched everywhere and cant find it (maybe im just blind)
 eulerscheZahl: firefighters had to come to stop the water
 Westicles: That place was dodgy as hell, we also had a tokamak.  They got a bunch of us students to come in at midnight and help haul off these 2-ton transformers full of PCB oil
 MSmits: lol euler
 MSmits: tokamaks are at least safe when it comes to radioactivity, but yeah that's lots of current
 MSmits: did they get a working fusion reaction going?
 sprkrd: a professor from that school told me that they guy who came to decommission the reactor was very sketchy, like straight from a 20s mafia
 sprkrd: no, it was just fission :joy:
 MSmits: no i meant Westicles
 sprkrd: ah, ok
 MSmits: tokamak is fusion reactor
 MSmits: magnetic containment
 nuggetbucket54: why do universities sound so crazy 
 MSmits: gets pretty hot, &gt; 100 million degreees
 nuggetbucket54: wow
 nuggetbucket54: celsius?
 MSmits: yes or kelvin, doesnt matter
 Scarfield: does it matter&#160;? :p
 nuggetbucket54: idk sorry
 MSmits: when you're speaking of millions then +273 does nothing
 nuggetbucket54: yeah
 nuggetbucket54: it's like a 300 difference
 Westicles: The student made one was pretty useless.  The big project one was cutting edge
 MSmits: it's very low pressure though
 eulerscheZahl: 100 million degrees smits. he made up his own temperature scale
 MSmits: 0.001% atmospheric
 MSmits: I might have, but no :P
 MSmits: I taught a 8 week course on nuclear fusion
 MSmits: otherwise i would not have known anything about it
 nuggetbucket54: you guys seem very knowledgeable
 MSmits: about some things
 Marchete: a mad scientist and a nuclear fusion course, what could go wrong....
 General_Imaginaer: there is this new thing... called google xD
 sprkrd: he is canadian, maybe the comparison was not between celcius and kelvin, but between celcius and farenheit L)
 MSmits: Marchete i did almost blow up a microwave to show plasma froma  candle :P
 General_Imaginaer: to mutch grapes in the microwave&#160;?
 MSmits: nah just used a candle
 Marchete: *uranium enriched candle*
 MSmits: :P
 nuggetbucket54: have you guys seen nilered's video on uranium glass
 struct: Where is the "do not try this at home" warning
 nuggetbucket54: it's kinda interesting to see how people used to eat out of that radioactive pottery
 Scarfield: school isnt at home
 MSmits: mmh I did actually remember to give the warning that time 
 MSmits: nuggetbucket54 people used to paint their watches with radioactive stuff so they could tell time in the dark
 nuggetbucket54: bruh 
 Marchete: and worse...
 nuggetbucket54: that's crazy
 MSmits: and the carnival used to have a thign where you could pay to see your skeleton
 nuggetbucket54: imagine in a few decades when people look back at us we may be doing something equivalent to eating out of radioactive pottery without even realizing it
 MSmits: yes, our sugar intake
 nuggetbucket54: hahahaha
 MSmits: thats just about as bad
 Marchete: don't search Radium girls
 Marchete: or anything from that time
 sprkrd: i'm gonna search radium girls
 KiwiTae: kids are invoking satan and demons in the living room should I worry?
 General_Imaginaer: this girls that painted the watches xD?
 Scarfield: xD kiwi
 MSmits: KiwiTae depends on the context
 Scarfield: if they drew a pentagram, you should worry
 struct: ill watch it Marchete, thanks
 MSmits: if they are doing historically correct reenactment of the inquisition it is educational
 Scarfield: suddenly start speaking latin -&gt; run
 General_Imaginaer: a pentagram is not a bad thing , only it signs in the direction of hell ^^
 sprkrd: "Radium Girls" is an awesome name for a musical band
 jacek: those girls were particularly radiant
 Scarfield: badum tss
 jacek: did you kill the chat
 Scarfield: yes, only took a drum kit
 struct: I was watching the plasma thing
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/l0u8Vtf2GoQ?t=677">https://youtu.be/l0u8Vtf2GoQ?t=677</a>
 Scarfield: you should see what i can do with a guitar
 Marchete: much worse than the drum!
 Marchete: 7 min this time
 Scarfield: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: even better at killing the chat than me
 Illedan: :skull:
 General_Imaginaer: :hamburger:
 Illedan: I got my kid the book Quantum computing for babies, but damn I struggle to understand this shit myself -.-
 Scarfield: killstroBytes
 Astrobytes: Is there a quantum computing for fathers book available?
 Illedan: Wikipedia has a bunch of text on the field atleast..
 Astrobytes: Scarfodrumitar
 General_Imaginaer: I heard from this new place , called google :P
 Scarfield: There was talk about asbestos ealier, and was happy with my "AsbestoBytes" but you werent here&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Oh nice!
 Astrobytes: Yes, I'm currently a rarity round here as I'm recovering from my broken wrist/hand crap
 Scarfield: :o
 Astrobytes: At least my arm is usable again after my covid shot D:
 Astrobytes: * :D
 Scarfield: sad to hear that, not like you needed more broken bones
 Astrobytes: Yeah indeed.
 General_Imaginaer: my left arm is after my covid shot yesterday completly hurt ...
 General_Imaginaer: it was my second shot
 Astrobytes: It's getting better quick though
 Westicles: Astro, you got the AZ?
 ItIsSoLo: u guys did the covid shots?
 Astrobytes: Pfizer
 General_Imaginaer: yeah i got BioNTech
 Astrobytes: I think here, over 40s get AZ everyone else gets A N Other
 Westicles: Like poor LIsa Shaw
 Astrobytes: An unfortunate case indeed.
 Scarfield: did you get the covid shot in the same arm as your broken wrist?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Astrobytes: By choice
 Scarfield: yea, otherwise would have been extra annoying
 Astrobytes: I didn't fancy being totally unable to do anything with my arms
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tenor.com/view/ace-ventura-running-arms-gif-11871322">https://tenor.com/view/ace-ventura-running-arms-gif-11871322</a>
 Astrobytes: They were numb were they not
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 Scarfield: yup
 Astrobytes: I think I prefer pain
 Astrobytes: Over numbness
 Astrobytes: Unexpectedly deep statement for a Friday.
 Scarfield:  "Fridays with AstroBytes" :notes::notes:
 Astrobytes: I was almost tempted to make my statement into a haiku but I lack the motivation
 Scarfield: hmm, just had a thought.. instead of doing %200 on simcount to limit how often you do time check, wouldnt it be much faster to do simCount &amp; 255&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, that's what i do
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think it's more efficient
 Astrobytes: I use powers of 2 at least
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: you dont do that already?
 MSmits: well you do (simCount &amp; 255) == 0
 MSmits: otherwise it's almost always true&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse:&#160;% 256 does the same is more readable /shrug
 Scarfield: just thought about it, so no&#160;:) and good point reBless, ty
 Astrobytes: *reShrug&#160;:)
 jacek: retrobytes
 florian.dumitrascu: silver league BITCHE
 florian.dumitrascu: S
 Astrobytes: I prefer jaceks 'retrobytes' over that florian
 florian.dumitrascu: sorrry that's my mate
 Scarfield: of course
 florian.dumitrascu: METALLICA RULES
 Astrobytes: No. No they do not.
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: Astro is Motorhead for life
 Astrobytes: I'm more death than thrash. But Slayer &gt; Metallica
 Scarfield: actually have a Lars Ulrich signature on my guitar, couldnt get the full band to sign it&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Because Lars is the only reasonable member of the band?
 florian.dumitrascu: OMG!!!!! so luuuuuuuuuucky!!!
 Astrobytes: Ahhh Zero Tolerance. It's nice to be back :D
 Westicles: was that a kick? lol
 Astrobytes: My injury has tied in nicely with my need for a break. Starting to get my mojo back.
 Scarfield: i was standing in line just behind an old friend of lars, and Lars was extra nice to me because of the delay, but the rest of the band looked like they just wanted to catch their plane, and i didnt press on
 Astrobytes: I think Lars is generally nicer than any of the others.
 Scarfield: everyone behind me had the same delay though :p
 Scarfield: yea seems like it, but only met them once
 Astrobytes: St. Anger snare
 Astrobytes: (that should have been a faux-emoji, sorry
 Astrobytes: )
 Scarfield: to this day im still sad Hammett didnt sign it
 Astrobytes: Why? Just perm your hair and play random things real fast and rock your wah pedal. Insta-Hammett
 Scarfield: oof
 Astrobytes: Heh heh
 Astrobytes: Nah I don't hate him
 Astrobytes: He's had his moments
 Scarfield: he was my "guitar hero" when i started :p
 Scarfield: angry astro noices
 Astrobytes: Trying to think who mine were/are
 Westicles: Yngwie Malmsteen?
 Scarfield: "play random things real fast" ahem :p
 Astrobytes: Sort of went from Steve Jones-&gt;Brian May-&gt;El Hefe and Eric Melvin-&gt;Hendrix-&gt;SRV-&gt;Jerry Garcia
 Scarfield: SRV that low? .O
 Scarfield: :o *
 Astrobytes: No, that's not in order of how great they are/were
 Scarfield: ah
 Astrobytes: Just whatever I was into at the time, whose playing I was  getting into etc
 Astrobytes: Yngwie ... oh dear. Did you check his latest album? He made it all himself. And it really, really, really sounds like he did.In a bad way.
 Scarfield: xD never liked his music, he is fast though
 Astrobytes: I can't listen to that endless shred stuff
 Astrobytes: Vai gets a free pass cause he played with Zappa
 Astrobytes: And he's a nice guy. So is Paul Gilbert.
 Astrobytes: Yngwie is just a relic.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, it's music time with astro again clearly. Apologies
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw74sDWPH7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw74sDWPH7U</a> np&#160;:)
 Scarfield: tender surrender steve vai, not sure what it is, but i've always loved it
 Astrobytes: He has some good music. I just always get bored a minute or two into it and stop.
 Astrobytes: However:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aUcmkfleQU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aUcmkfleQU</a>
 Scarfield: dayum
 Scarfield: satriani as backing guitarist :p
 Scarfield: oh, there he goes
 Astrobytes: Vai, Satch and Eric Johnson
 Astrobytes: Zappa song. I enjoyed that one. They did Down Down Down too I think, that was cool.
 Astrobytes: *Going Down

 Astrobytes: That's the last one I'm posting
 Scarfield: it auto suggested red house, it will have to wait&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: never knew of this concert, nice man!
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they've done a few with a few different guest guitarists
 Astrobytes: Not all good
 Scarfield: yea, putting stars together doesnt work well that often
 Astrobytes: Yngwie doing Voodoo Chile was especially unpleasant. Check them all out anyway, some gems to be found
 Scarfield: im gonna skip the yngwie ones
 Scarfield: only 8 videos on the g3VEVO channel&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Do some digging
 Scarfield: yea, just thought you linked a goldmine&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You know what to look for
 Scarfield: yup
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G3_(tour)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G3_(tour)</a>
 Astrobytes: That's some list
 BlaiseEbuth: That's another:

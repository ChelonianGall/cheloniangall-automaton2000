 Blokops: oh the achivmnet
 7teen: clesh of cod
 Wontonimo: oh, i hated the clash one
 Blokops: tried doing the code of legends bot
 Blokops: but only made it to silver
 Wontonimo: i don't play any more
 Blokops: i think you can reach top 100 if you grid CoC
 Wontonimo: maybe top 100 in clash, but not overall
 Wontonimo: without playing multis, you'll probably not even get into the top 2000 with just working clash
 Blokops: mmm did i make a mistke for playing code of legends
 Blokops: i yet to see a top ranker that playe dthat game
 Wontonimo: looks like legends of code is very heuristic based and not about high optimization
 Wontonimo: so any language has a fighting chance
 Wontonimo: i even see python3 and java in legend
 Blokops: let me tell you is like 40% luck
 Blokops: i when from bronze 100 to silver 1 with the same code
 Thorcode: bruh
 Wontonimo: lol
 Blokops: tried to push my luck to reach gold and now i can go past silver 30
 Blokops: cant*
 Thorcode: haha
 Wontonimo: do you have a local simulation?
 Blokops: nope
 Wontonimo: have you looked at brutal tester to see if there is support for it?
 Blokops: you know what lts run it right now 
 Blokops: and no idea what that is
 Blokops: top 16 silver right now lets see what happens
 Wontonimo: oh yeah, brutal tester supports legends of code and magic <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 Blokops: i might lose my top 0.9%
 Wontonimo: you can run different versions of your code locally against eachother 
 Wontonimo: and get better stats
 Blokops: does it support python
 Wontonimo: all languages
 Blokops: top 57 with 20% done
 Wontonimo: i hear mad pod racing is the easiest to get legend in.  I got my first legend in ultimate tic tac toe
 Blokops: i want to do the pod racing but alas school has begun
 Wontonimo: good luck with the learning
 Wontonimo: feel the knowledge 
 Blokops: yea it was a bad idea to run code of legends
 Blokops: i just lost my place
 drollins214: I just did a puzzle authored by Wontonimo and approved by Blokops. Small world haha
 gabyy420: hi
 Blokops: hey
 gabyy420: I'm now here..
 Blokops: you sure are
 Blokops: so what you working on
 gabyy420: I just really want to learn how to code.
 Blokops: i recommend trying the "easy puzzles"
 Blokops: detective pickachu part 1 is a good start
 Blokops: lets me get you the link

 gabyy420: Thank you 
 Blokops: dang got one bad clash of code and my rank drop like a brick
 Husoski: Blokops Don't I know it!  Seems like it takes 10 first or 2nd clashes to make up for one crash-n-burn.
 Xascoria: just don't lose even once 4head
 Xascoria: sup
 kurtesy: dang it
 Blokops: bad clash?
 eulerscheZahl: &gt; You have used 80% of your 550 free dyno hours for January 2022.
 Blokops: what
 xyh_from_China:&#160;??
 xyh_from_China: 疑惑？
 Kururugi: dyno hrs?
 Kururugi: what is that?
 eulerscheZahl: that's the currency to run my puzzle search at  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i don't pay for hosting, so they will just shut it down if it has too high activity
 Jerrasterix: So are people searching on your website and just copy pasting the code :astonished:
 Uljahn: might be worse: people make bots to abuse the search
 eulerscheZahl: once i watched a twitch stream and there was a reverse clash. checked the logs and 2 different IP addresses were searching for the task while the clash was still running&#160;:(
 Jerrasterix: They are cheating.... This is atrocious 
 eulerscheZahl: dual use thing. you can use a knife to cut your bread. or to stab someone
 Jerrasterix: ohh yeah I remember, isn't it the codingame and coderpad merger stream&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: initially i wrote it to help myself moderating contributions and refuse duplicates
 eulerscheZahl: also look at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020554RU">https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020554RU</a>

 eulerscheZahl: that's my RAIC 2020 tshirt + hoodie :sob:
 Uljahn: *response
 eulerscheZahl: a 15min delay? :D
 Uljahn: or 5 min
 eulerscheZahl: even if there is (would be some work, heroku sets the timeout to much less), that would make the site pretty much useless
 Jerrasterix: wait a sec, you are not a mod anymore ahh.. euler??
 eulerscheZahl: no, i resigned
 eulerscheZahl: together with astro, ille, neuman n
 Jerrasterix: ohhh... why did you guys quit as a bunch&#160;?? 
 eulerscheZahl: CG: just to check with you if you still want to be modsme: i'll resign if the next contest will be another escapeCG: maybe you should quit if that's your only motivationme: ok, bye
 eulerscheZahl: paraphrasing here
 eulerscheZahl: CG: thanks for your service. THIS IS SPARTAme: removed from mods channel :D
 Jerrasterix: and one more doubt, for Pathfinding , do you guys use 2d arrays or someother things 
 eulerscheZahl: check my forum profile, i may have left an easter egg there as my status
 eulerscheZahl: depends on my current mood. 2D array is fine
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i define a Node class containing a List&lt;Node&gt; neighbors
 Jerrasterix: you are also 3rd in ranking, who is 1st&#160;??

 Rebollo: This object:
 Rebollo:  GolfGame *root = new GolfGame(gameStateControl-&gt;matrixOfArea, height, width);
 Rebollo: How can I create a copy of this guy wihtou referenciing it?
 Kcbeebooboobop: .-- .... .- - / .. ... / ..- .--. / -- .- -.
 Rebollo: It seems to be impossible
 Rebollo: I tried to create this copy function:
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80efa4af-ea19-4d5a-b8c6-19e5453a8572">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80efa4af-ea19-4d5a-b8c6-19e5453a8572</a>
 Rebollo: c++
 DjDijei: have you tried fixing the code?
 Rebollo: Sorry what do you mean?
 C26_1: @Rebollo, he means debug the code to find the error
 Rebollo: Hum I see I tried a lot of things
 C26_1: @Rebollo, debug means run the code step-by-step until find the error that made the code worked wrongly
 Rebollo: The code sseems to be alright
 5DN1L: C26_1 ok
 C26_1: @Rebollo, so your mission is to make a copy of an array and change it without change the old one right
 Rebollo: yes
 C26_1: So B copy A, changed B and not change A by some referenced error
 C26_1: ok I understand now
 C26_1: I think you neeed to do something else
 Rebollo: The class properties are all pointers as well
 C26_1: it looks something like this
 Rebollo: I dont know if it amtters
 C26_1: - Step 1: For each elements in A, copy to B until copied all of it- Step 2: Tried to change B, see if A is also changed
 Rebollo: I did it
 Rebollo: by using this copy function
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4b2082f0-5841-4d54-9a26-3d322d579733">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4b2082f0-5841-4d54-9a26-3d322d579733</a>

 AYB: good morning geeks
 AYB: need some help 
 AYB: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/reversed-look-and-say">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/reversed-look-and-say</a>
 AYB: i have passed all the tests except test number 03  
 AYB: FailureFound: 222222222Expected: 2222122222
 AYB: i dont now why my number found is wrong 
 C26_1: So wait
 C26_1: 1412211512 =&gt; 2222122222
 AYB: yes the is the result that should be consoled
 C26_1: one 1, one 4, one 1, two 2, two 1, one 5, one 1, one 2
 C26_1: Wait
 AYB: 141221512
 C26_1: It's the string multiplication
 C26_1: So the number of digits of every input must be even
 AYB: actually my algo find the result and its add one more step 
 AYB: 2222122222
 C26_1: 1412211512
 AYB: two 2,two 2,one 2,two 2, two 2.
 C26_1: That means:1 x "4" + 1 x "2" + 2 x "1" + 1 x "5" + 1 x "2"
 AYB: 222222222
 AYB: ok
 C26_1: 421152
 C26_1: 4 x "2" + 1 x "1" + 5 x "2"
 AYB: 2222 1 22222
 C26_1: = 44122222
 C26_1: Ah ok, I'm confused at this step
 AYB: i see 
 AYB: but you are right until now
 C26_1: 2222122222
 C26_1: 4 x "2" means 4 consecutive 2
 C26_1: I think the backwards as 2 consecutive 4
 C26_1: That's why I'm vonfused
 C26_1: confused*
 AYB: why i should stop in this result i mean 2222122222
 AYB: is it because i have four "2"?? 
 C26_1: Hmmm
 C26_1: reversible
 C26_1: Let me check
 Kururugi: why
 5DN1L: Because 222222222 doesn't lead to 421152
 AYB: hmm
 C26_1: Ok
 AYB: and 2222122222 does?
 C26_1: So iterated until the number cannot be reversible
 5DN1L: AYB yes
 AYB: how pls?
 5DN1L: four 2s, one 1, five 2s
 AYB: yeap 
 C26_1: Wait
 5DN1L: 222222222 is nine 2s
 5DN1L: 222222222 -&gt; 92
 AYB: thank you 5DN1l and thank you C26_1
 C26_1: I find that number 2222122222 can still be reversible
 C26_1: So I'm counting the number of each digit by groups, if I encouter another number then reset the counter and start counting again
 C26_1: And after all counting things, I could just make 421152 from 2222122222
 AYB: ok
 AYB: nice idea
 AYB: so i just need to make a method that reverse my result if cant reveres it should return false
 C26_1: yea
 AYB: on it
 AYB: thank you
 C26_1: At least if someone want to make the puzzle then it needs to be consistents 
 C26_1: I read the puzzle Look-and-say and found some inconsistent test case
 5DN1L: What do you mean
 BlaiseEbuth: Another bug in the puzzle...
 C26_1: @5DN1L, in Reversed Look-and-say puzzle, there's an inconsistent test case
 BlaiseEbuth: That's clearer...
 5DN1L: C26_1 Elaborate instead of repeat
 ASM_MOV_INT: so elaborate = rinse.... he's really asking you to rinse and repeat
 ASM_MOV_INT: whoops i meant rinse, not repeat
 ASM_MOV_INT: lol
 AYB: how we can reveres from 1 to 1211??
 AYB: :confounded:
 AYB: i dont know but i found this puzzle a little confusing 
 C26_1: 1 = 1 x "1" =&gt; 1111 = 2 x "1" =&gt; 211 x "2" + 1 x "1" =&gt; 1211
 C26_1: @AYB
 AYB: ok i see 
 AYB: thank you @C26_1
 C26_1: ok
 AYB: look and say indeed
 BlaiseEbuth: Still don't know what is inconsistent, excepted your affirmation C26_1
 C26_1: @BlaiseEbuth, 2222122222= 2 x "2" + 2 x "2" + 1 x "2" + 2 x "2" + 2 x "2"= 222222222
 C26_1: Oh wait
 C26_1: I understand
 C26_1: That means from 222222222, you cannot make 2222122222
 C26_1: So 2222122222 is the last valid number and you print it out
 derjack: wtf in othello? :scream:
 C26_1: @derjack, what do you mean (wdym)?
 C26_1: Random Fun Fact: Lobsters used to be the only food for poors, prisoners and slaves. Todays, to even buy a lobsters would be a huge problem for your wallet (Except in America and all countries who has lots of sea or countries that has a very valuable type of money) 
 C26_1: Random means it doesn't related to coding
 C26_1: And I wish everyone's year lucky and safe
 C26_1: Cuz this is the first day of Tet holiday (According to Lunar Calendar)
 5DN1L: Don't do that again, C26_1
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: Bye bye
 jacek: Nyanyan is on :fire:
 struct: I wonder how strong his bot his without the book
 struct: bot is*
 jacek: well ~37 plies against mah bot
 jacek: if hes not trolling
 struct: Only if I had done what recurse suggested

 jacek: maybe perfect game
 xyh_from_China: emm
 jacek: ohai
 struct: 45/46 plies on the draw
 struct: then its solved as draw
 KanekiWeb: hi
 jacek: wheres MSmits when we need him
 struct: Msmits lost his book title
 Nyanyan: struct I think my bot is as strong as 3rd-5th in codingame othello without book
 struct: :thumbsup:
 Nyanyan: Mean absolute error of my bot's evaluation function is about 5.0 stones to 6.4 stones.
 _Faycal_: can we find the solution after the ens of the clash code&#160;?
 Jacxk: not really
 IamFish: Usually people will share their solutions after a clash, so you can look at how they did it
 C26_1: Does playing CoC gained exp?
 jacek: no
 IamFish: Not directly
 IamFish: you can get achievements for playing a lot, and you can progress the Quest Map
 Nyanyan: I wonder if othello bots competes each other from random positions. Then opening books become useless.
 jacek: its called xot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/aboutxot.php?lang=en">https://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/aboutxot.php?lang=en</a> starting from random balanced 8-plies games
 jacek: implemented in some online othello tournaments
 Nyanyan: That's what I suggested!

 C26_1: Hello everyone
 IamFish: Hello
 C26_1: I'm studying about Bitwise now
 C26_1: ~What do you called this operator?
 C26_1: Cuz there are two names for it
 C26_1: UNARY 
 jacek: negation
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: thank you
 jacek: and the character is called tilde
 struct: I would add those openings but its too late now
 struct: would break 99% of the bots
 Astrobytes: Othello II: Cassio's Revenge
 jacek: then make othello960
 Nyanyan: I think creating new arena is a good idea. If there is something I can do for that, I'll do it.
 darkhorse64: add a league and break the rules
 Astrobytes: Or add a rule and break the league :tada:
 Astrobytes: Seriously though, I have no issues with the alternative start othello being added

 Wontonimo: did you use convolution (or something like it) for breakthrough jacek&#160;?
 p.p.o.p.: Just completed my first medium puzzle and feeling pumped!
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 jacek: Wontonimo no
 jacek: good old one-hot inputs
 Wontonimo: wth
 jacek:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: how do you convert a 8x8 board with 3 states per square into 1hot?  is that 8x8x3 one-hots?
 Wontonimo: no, it's way more than that...
 Wontonimo: actually, i don't understand at all what is in your one-hot
 jacek: in simplest form: 64 squares, each square can have empty, white, black
 jacek: so 192 inputs
 jacek: in which exactly 64 are 'ones'
 Wontonimo: got it
 jacek: in my case, each square can have 12 states
 Wontonimo: how 12?
 Wontonimo: and not 3
 jacek: *2 - it the square is also attacked, *2 - if the square is also defended by my pawn
 Wontonimo: oh, clever to encode priors
 jacek: i used to use 24 states for *2 - side to move, but rotating the board depending on side to move is sufficient
 Wontonimo: I'll call that pseudo convolution 
 jacek: most of my NNs are overparametized
 Wontonimo: that's a great prior
 jacek: im more limited by size than calculation time
 struct: you dont take into account mobility?
 struct: or is a move forward considered an attack?
 jacek: maybe the attacked squares could be seen as mobility
 jacek: also thanks to one-hots, each move changes at most 6 squares, so no need to recalculate all the NN
 jacek: or if i used the simplest form - only 2 squares would change
 Wontonimo: hmm.  the recalculate savings is just for the first layer, but that could be a significant savings if your one-hot is the largest part 
 Wontonimo: that's cool
 Wontonimo: makes mcts playouts much faster
 jacek: yeah, for bt i use 2 layers. for most games i only use 1
 Wontonimo: lol wow
 Kururugi: only 1 hidden layer?
 Wontonimo: that really insults human ability
 Wontonimo: to be outdone with 1 layer of nn
 Wontonimo: *hidden
 jacek: its the matter of speed vs quality
 jacek: and youre slowpoke, i published that tutorial week ago :v
 Wontonimo: i am!  
 Wontonimo: tell me, where are these articles highlighted and promoted&#160;?
 Wontonimo: how, when i log onto CG, am I notified of these gems?
 Astrobytes: You're not.
 jacek: you dont&#160;:?
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: i know&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: the whole of tech.io platform is completely underutilised
 Wontonimo: it's like it is a secret club
 Astrobytes: I mean it's used frequently, but CG-wise it's not leveraged properly imo
 Wontonimo: i help noobs by sharing tech.io snippets and the reaction is "wow, that's cool you can share runnable code like that"
 Kururugi: would be nice if we were notified of posts in tech.io instead of contributions for cg
 Astrobytes: hehehe indeed
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: right?
 jacek: yeah, why they do distract this clash of code site with nonsenses like tech.io or multiplayer games :unamused:

 jacek: no one knows what to do with javascript. many people would just put it to trash :v
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: ever try looking up how to do it?
 beedeeboe: nup wouldnt know where to start seraching
 5DN1L: try google?
 LADYSMAN905: hello
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: look up codngames javasciprt
 LADYSMAN905: how do you create a game from scratch
 dwaltsch: hello peoplö
 dwaltsch: amogus
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: dont know lady'sman
 dwaltsch: i am searching for duo mate
 dwaltsch: fortnite i have 2k hours
 LADYSMAN905: Thank you for your help eve
 5DN1L: dwaltsch wrong place
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: ladysman906, how did i help?
 beedeeboe: you know what imma stop with this crap im done after only fudging 20ins cus i have NO clue what to do
 beedeeboe: bye
 5DN1L: bye
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: bye-bye
 FrancoRoura: ladysman906, you can try getting a few assets for your game on Unity and write code to move the assets when the player clicks or presses a key

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im gonna go try tynker
 Butanium: for protyping a game you can get assets here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kenney.nl/assets">https://www.kenney.nl/assets</a>
 Nachosauce: unity is really nice for making games. It makes it a lot easier than you'd expect :D
 jacek: i though CG SDK was easiest for making games :v
 Butanium: lol
 Butanium: as far as you don't try to do some js stuff
 Butanium: it's not that complicated
 Butanium: but once you start doing js stuff
 Butanium: you are entering hell
 ninjadip: i gotta learn me some JS
 Butanium: js is not the problem I think
 Butanium: it's that nothing is really documented
 Butanium: so you have to try to copy existing code and understand how they work to make your own
 PringleOrange: do i get extra cp in bot programming if i rank up?
 5DN1L: depends on how much you rank up
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/help/rank">https://www.codingame.com/help/rank</a>
 PringleOrange: but i mean like
 PringleOrange: wood and bronze league
 PringleOrange: would i get extra cp for going from wood league to bronze league
 5DN1L: there's only one single leaderboard for cp calculation no matter your league
 Nachosauce: In that link, scroll down to "How are the CPs calculated". It will answer your question&#160;:) 
 5DN1L: you get xp from going up a league though
 PringleOrange: ah okay ty
 The_Village_Whizz: @efe44 that was a close one
 efe44: yes
 efe44: but it is about character number
 blokman: no
 ProCrazyCoder: nybody knows how to remove thick cursor from IDE?
 ninjadip: cut it in half
 Nachosauce: try pressing insert
 ProCrazyCoder: im pressing but nothing happens
 ProCrazyCoder: ninjadip&#160;:)
 ninjadip: lol
 ninjadip: tried to show my non coding co-workers how i passed the mars lander 2. i think they are more confused after my explanation then before..
 ninjadip: than*
 5DN1L: that's the whole point isn't it? :upside_down:
 Blokops: do part 3 now
 ProCrazyCoder: What about mass of fuel in MarsLander task?
 Blokops: also dont forget to submit your work into the optimization version (free cp)
 Blokops: sad times i went from clash rank 300 to 500 in the spam of 1 day
 Blokops: i really need to learn regular expresions
 ninjadip: i was a beast at one time with it, had to use it for a class project. now i have no idea... in the span of a year
 ninjadip: yeah i'm in both versions
 ninjadip: i'll come back to part 3. working on genome sequencing now
 zophia2222: hello
 ProCrazyCoder: hi
 ninjadip: whats up crazy
 ninjadip: better than amateur
 zophia2222: why you call me crazy??
 ProCrazyCoder: she is definitely gonna hack someone
 zophia2222: poo]\
 zophia2222: ooh
 zophia2222: uh oh
 Master_Zain: criminal mastermind
 ProCrazyCoder: tab doesnt work in ide who knows why
 Josdel: hello guys
 Josdel: all fine?
 OctoCat_: :grin:
 ProCrazyCoder: hhihihihi
 dickclayer: hey fuckers
 ClaudCRS: hello people
 FrancoRoura: @5DN1L
 <b>**Tien2k9 slaps  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/74849060371350" /> ninjadip: slaps who around?
 ninjadip: i don't get it... why does my own substring function perform as expected and the built-in c++ string.substr() give me weird results
 ninjadip: re: genome sequencing
 ninjadip: ugh.. at least now i'm getting them. i have all the validators except the last two
 ninjadip: there is one validator i'm not passing on Genome Sequencing. Does anyone know if the validator "Sequences included and disjointed" means that one sequence could have two sequences?? like a space in between? nothing like that is mentioned in the the game details
 Wontonimo: what are you working on ninjadip&#160;?
 Smelty: o. O
 Wontonimo: hey Smelty.  do you know?
 Wontonimo: you look like you are lookking at my code
 ninjadip: re: genome sequencing
 Wontonimo: oh
 Smelty: oh
 Wontonimo: i thought that was the algo you were using not the name of the puzzle
 ninjadip: on the very last one, i'm getting 10 instead of 11
 Smelty: also huh im getting slightly better on coc
 ninjadip: oh lol
 ninjadip: yeah that's understandable
 Smelty: can you send the link of the puzzle?
 ASM_MOV_INT: clash of code is LIFE
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/genome-sequencing">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/genome-sequencing</a>
 ninjadip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/genome-sequencing">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/genome-sequencing</a>
 Wontonimo: no it isn't!
 Wontonimo: double sequenced
 ninjadip: jinx
 Smelty: joinxed
 Smelty: forgot how to ping people in world chat
 ninjadip: i see something...
 Wontonimo: me too!
 ninjadip: going to write my own search instead of using string.find()
 ninjadip: stupid builtin junk
 Wontonimo: what lang?
 Smelty: ninja wait a couple months im going to try the puzzle then give feedback
 ninjadip: got me all the way there except for one step
 ninjadip: c++
 Smelty: hmm not too far from java ig
 Smelty: i coded auton for vex contests with c++
 ninjadip: maybe i can tweak the find() to my use
 Smelty: hm
 ninjadip: wish i was back into regex.. would have had it done
 ninjadip: but i quit, i'm 12 months clean from regex.. i was hooked bad
 Smelty: good
 ninjadip: always know what to expect with regex though
 ninjadip: no surprises
 Wontonimo: did you got to regex rehab?
 Wontonimo: i hear Scientologists expect people to purge themselves of regex.  is that why?
 ninjadip: dodm
 ninjadip: didn't have the money
 ninjadip: for rehab let alone scientolgy
 Smelty: for some reason i feel like using a recursive function that combines the two with the most overlapping chars
 ninjadip: not needed
 Smelty: h umst
 ninjadip: just search then beginning and end of the string for matches, cause that's the only place you can add them anyway
 ninjadip: effiency
 Smelty: i like being inefficient so a octuple nested recursive for loop inside nested if it is
 Wontonimo: most recursion can be changed into a loop.  and if it can then a loop is usually a better solution
 ninjadip: how else are you going to add a truncated string to merge to another except on the ends? so only search the ends
 Smelty: hmm yes
 ninjadip: it's already a loop
 Smelty: while(wordCount&gt;0){
 Smelty: my code is done
 ninjadip: everything's ball bearings now-a-days, don't you see?
 ninjadip: ok.. you have to find a match
 ninjadip: then add the difference of the match to either the front or the end
 Smelty: oh yea forgot
 ninjadip: yep
 Smelty: cout &lt;&lt; length &lt;&lt; endl;
 Smelty: dOnE
 ninjadip: 70% of the time, it works everytime. right? 
 Smelty: yep
 ninjadip: that's good enough for me
 Smelty: in fact recent research has proven that it works an entire -10% chance
 Smelty: *of the time
 ninjadip: sequencing... done. next project
 Smelty: :thinking:
 ASM_MOV_INT: next project: virtual copy bitwise of planet earth
 ninjadip: oh man, speaking of, have you seen any of these cool game boy camera images from projects on hackaday?
 ninjadip: one guy put a telephoto lens attachment on it with a 3-d printer
 Smelty: oh wow
 Wontonimo: what's your next project ninjadip&#160;?
 Wontonimo: I'd be honoured if you tried wave function collapse 
 ninjadip: idk yet
 ninjadip: rewriting this.. might finish it tomorrow
 ninjadip: Wontonimo is that something you wrote?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: i didn't come up with the concept
 ninjadip: ok i'll have to remember
 ninjadip: ok
 Wontonimo: here's a gif of WFC in action for inspiration <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/blob/master/images/wfc.gif">https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/blob/master/images/wfc.gif</a>
 ninjadip: oh man that's trippy
 Wontonimo: given a small example, WFC can create many unique variations of it 
 ASM_MOV_INT: wave function collapse huh, looks like it can make some neat looking stuff!
 ninjadip: is that what they use in map generation or older retro games?
 ninjadip: for like repeating the background
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's making its way into game dev also <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnFj3dOKcIQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnFj3dOKcIQ</a>
 Wontonimo: for city and dungeon generation
 ninjadip: yeah yeah
 ASM_MOV_INT: awesome, definitely have to do a project on this
 Wontonimo: the puzzle here is designed as a tutorial and skips the shannon entropy part of WFC to make it easier
 ninjadip: YES!!!!
 ninjadip: 100%&#160;:)
 ninjadip: sequence that b*?#!
 ASM_MOV_INT: wave form collapse seems quite awesome
 ninjadip: oh mug... it's loaded
 ninjadip: time to chill, i will come to it tomorrow Wontonimo
 ninjadip: i want to enjoy my completion buzz for a bit
 ninjadip: peace
 ASM_MOV_INT: nice
 ASM_MOV_INT: wave function* collapse is what I meant

 Blokops: nothing like the feeling like feeling dumb because you cant solve a "easy" puzzle
 Wontonimo: which 'easy' puzzle?
 Blokops: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/retaining-water">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/retaining-water</a>
 RedClownFTW_350c: Hi
 Blokops: hullo
 Wontonimo: are you familiar with cellular automata&#160;?
 Blokops: nope
 Wontonimo: conways game of life?
 Blokops: nope * 2
 Wontonimo: flood fill
 Blokops: print("nope "*3)
 Wontonimo: sadness
 Blokops: print(True)
 Wontonimo: well, all those are great things to google after this
 Wontonimo: do you want more hints than those topics?
 Blokops: found a cool easter egg if you google conways game of life
 Blokops: and yes please
 Wontonimo: okay, let's just start with the sides.  everything will spill off the sides
 Blokops: i refuse to beleive that a "easy" puzzle uses graph search and memoization
 Blokops: so find the side with the smalles value
 Wontonimo: so, if a side has a height of 3, then there will be no water on it, and anything directly beside it will have it's water reduced to 3
 Blokops: but what if inside theres a enclosing of side 100 
 Blokops: then it could hold more water
 Wontonimo: wait wait
 Wontonimo: 999993117999999
 Wontonimo: let's say this is the height map
 Wontonimo: where 1 is lowest
 Blokops: brbr class back in session
 RedClownFTW_350c: help MARS LANDER - EPISODE 1 здуфыу
 RedClownFTW_350c: please
 RedClownFTW_350c: sorry
 Wontonimo: sure
 Wontonimo: have you rread the instructions on the left?
 Wontonimo: and found out how fast you are allowed to crash into the ground RedClownFTW_350c&#160;?
 RedClownFTW_350c: Yes. I am not understand(((
 Wontonimo: well, i can't really help with reading for you, since whatever I write you'd also have to read
 Wontonimo: what have you tried so far
 Wontonimo: you don't have to use an angle other than 0
 Wontonimo: just change the thrust
 RedClownFTW_350c: I tried using the condition:grin:
 Wontonimo: which condition?
 Wontonimo: have you tried using a thrust of 3 or 4&#160;?
 RedClown: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/69a7eb53-24cd-4d33-b885-c14c246051e7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/69a7eb53-24cd-4d33-b885-c14c246051e7</a>
 Wontonimo: ah
 RedClown: I'm new at this
 Wontonimo: try thispower = vSpeed &gt; -35&#160;? 2&#160;: 4;
 Wontonimo: it means
 Wontonimo: check vSpeed &gt; -35
 Wontonimo: if it is true&#160;? 2
 Wontonimo: else&#160;: 4
 RedClown: One second
 Wontonimo: another way is to abuse the fact that false = 0 and true = 1 and do this
 Wontonimo: power = 2*(vSpeed &gt; -35) + 2;
 Wontonimo: or if you wanted a power of 4 or 0 then simplypower = 4*(vSpeed &gt; -35);
 Wontonimo: orpower = vSpeed &gt; -35&#160;? 4&#160;: 0;
 Wontonimo: same thing, completed differently using different language features
 RedClown: this should be put in "if"?
 Blokops: has anyone gotten all the achivemnets
 Blokops: is that even possible
 RedClown: what language do you use?
 FORMS1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/999c9a26-24d6-4da3-96f4-bd53a2ffa09e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/999c9a26-24d6-4da3-96f4-bd53a2ffa09e</a>
 FORMS1: I'm so close, can anyone tell me why I'm getting the small foramatting error on only the top 3 rows?
 FORMS1: test case 5
 FORMS1: nm, just figured it out.
 FORMS1: Oh validators can go suck it
 RedClown: do not say that
 FORMS1: You're right, they're doing their job.
 FORMS1: Is there somewhere I go to understand what particular validator I have not met and how I can correct it?

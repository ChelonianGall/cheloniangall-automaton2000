 talkingjerry: can anyone help me with the descent
 Darleanow: ofc sir&#160;!
 Darleanow: what's ur problem&#160;?
 talkingjerry: i dont know how to do this
 talkingjerry: im new btw sir
 Darleanow: i know&#160;!
 Darleanow: it's not the easiest one when u're a begineer
 Darleanow: i'd suggest to maybe try thor before
 talkingjerry: oh  okay sir thank you very much
 Darleanow: np&#160;:)
 ellen_lu: what do i do for the temperature one
 Darleanow: not the easiest one too&#160;:)
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor-episode-1</a>
 Darleanow: this one&#160;!
 Darleanow: just simple logic
 Darleanow: easy like "hello world"
 ellen_lu: okay! thank you!!
 ellen_lu: oh, i already did the thor one. im just confused for the temperature on how to make a for i in statement
 Darleanow: okay so
 Darleanow: you can do multiple types of for i
 Darleanow: the first is with numbers
 Darleanow: for i in range(10)
 Darleanow: will print number from 0 to 9
 Darleanow: the last number is n-1, but it will loop 10 times&#160;!
 Darleanow: also, for example if you want to loop over a string or a list
 Darleanow: you do a for i in
 Darleanow: and it will iterate through each element of the string/list
 Darleanow: anyone is doing/did brain fork&#160;? how do we deal with spaces&#160;? 
 Darleanow: i tried to check if i wasnt a space, but getting an IndexError
 DaNinja: set space=0, A=1, etc
 Darleanow: thankjs&#160;:)
 derjack: :upside_down:
 derjack: is this the last day of chat?
 Nadeshiko: hi everyone
 Nadeshiko: have a good day!
 TurushkinStanislav: what is easiest game here
 derjack: mad pod racing?
 Nadeshiko: some clashes are super short...
 derjack: shortest mode? :thinking:
 TurushkinStanislav: i dont understand i change angle nothing happens
 TurushkinStanislav: =\
 Nadeshiko: :flushed:
 derjack: youre supposed to give x y thrust
 j4at: search race is an easier version of mad pod racing
 DomiKo: wait
 DomiKo: optim as vote event?
 DomiKo: they will show the best solutions to optim?
 derjack: oh my
 j4at: THEY WILL SHOW THE BEST SOLUTION&#160;?? THEY WILL SHOW THE CODE&#160;? 
 j4at: I think they will reveal best solutions during the event
 j4at: like a leaderboard
 DomiKo: yes they show the codes
 j4at: damn
 DomiKo: they did it for standard puzzles
 wlesavo: DomiKo was discussed yearsterday, but no official comment
 DomiKo: ok ok
 wlesavo: one point westicles made there is no publish button for optim
 j4at: calssic puzzles are not ranked tho
 j4at: classic*
 fahad_almaani: hi progeammersas dawwd awdca
 Crosility: Was suppose to visit family Friday. Car dies wednesday. Murphys law in effect again.
 HoangH7: Hello
 Uljahn: there is an official statement on the event by Thibaud on discord: "So I've set the review start date as the end date so this phase shouldn't happen and no solutions could be shared."
 j4at: nice
 jacek: dat ux
 j4at: I found a small bug in my search race. I'm getting 12k with the bug, Hopefully top 10 after I fix it&#160;:)
 jacek: nn?
 j4at: yeah
 j4at: I'm using RL
 j4at: what about you&#160;?
 jacek: evolution strategies
 j4at: Oh, I was actually going to add evolution strategies after training using RL
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/nnaisense/pgpelib">https://github.com/nnaisense/pgpelib</a> + clipUp its pretty hyperparameter-free
 j4at: cool
 neguinOfSenai: hello
 delon10: Hello, in Mad Pod Racing how am I supposed to use the command BOOST in my code&#160;? 
 Crosility: store if boost been used or not.
 Crosility: if not, instead of thrust, output boost
 Crosility: set used to true
 delon10: But how does my pod will know when to use it&#160;? 
 Crosility: you tell it when..
 Aldoggen: do you want to know how to use it or when to use it?
 Crosility: I set a conditional my first implementation, based on distance to next checkpoint.
 Aldoggen: ^ me too
 delon10: oh okay so I just store BOOST as a bool and when used it becomes True 
 delon10: so it can't be used again 
 delon10: thanks guys 
 Aldoggen: if you've already boosted, boost just gets changed to 100% thrust, so there's not much harm in using it whenever
 Aldoggen: except you should probably just store it
 xx_zero: hey guys

 jacek: j4at do you use discrete actions?
 Westicles: 4 1-stars for kiss the girls!  the #fr are circling their wagons
 jacek: french kiss the girls?
 Westicles: o.O
 j4at: jacek didn't use discrete actions in cg yet
 j4at: but I did in the past
 j4at: I'm going to use discrete actions for the event proably

 Aldoggen: time complexity?
 Aldoggen: it's linear in time
 Aldoggen: not constant in space though
 Westicles: therealbeef you need to approve it

 eulerscheZahl: then we have to resubmit our bots? and get new bosses?
 eulerscheZahl: or all woods again?
 jacek: "Fix the TASK_PRIORIZATION possible moves" :heart:
 eulerscheZahl: you have to start training from scratch
 jacek: *2 hours later*
 eulerscheZahl: in squdward vioce?
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot an i
 jacek: v44: should be the final one ... V53
 eulerscheZahl: the final final one
 jujurocking: v51 with (I hope) the last fixes 
 eulerscheZahl: i like his confidence
 struct: so its the game getting released or is it like coif?
 Astrobytes: looks like coif-style
 Astrobytes: Yes, bisou is asking us to check it out and let him know if any further fixes/improvements are needed
 struct: well it looks better now the animations
 iggy12345: hey struct, I don't know if you saw my question earlier, but for othello, are the boards always the same size?
 struct: yes they are
 iggy12345: sweet, thank you
 jacek: 29 :tada:
 struct: Where jacek?
 jacek: lvl
 struct: oh grats
 HenroLST: Nice!
 Astrobytes: iggy12345: I answered you but it was kinda late
 HenroLST: would someone be willing to explain the logic behind how to solve a puzzle to me? I understand what to do, but not how to do
 Aldoggen: below the place where you write code, you can see some buttons to execute test cases
 Aldoggen: to solve the puzzle you need to pass all test cases
 HenroLST: oops, i meant the actual puzzle itself :sweat_smile:
 HenroLST: avtually i think i found something im going to try
 Aldoggen: okay, your question sounds vague to me, so I'm just gonna say what I do. I read the statement on the left. then I think of a strategy for a minute. longer if needed. then I start coding and try to pass the test cases
 Aldoggen: or do you mean how to pass a specific puzzle? can you tell me the name?
 HenroLST: its the stock exchange losses, sorry about the vauge wording 
 HenroLST: but i think i figured it out?
 Aldoggen: test cases will be the judge of that&#160;:)
 HenroLST: yup, im praying this works
 Ayza: HenroLST, basically you are given testcases to test your code, when you pass all of them you are supposed to submit then there will be validators (hidden testcases to avoid hardcoding) to validate your code and finally give you your score :slight_smile:
 Ayza: if thats your question
 Aldoggen: he was asking for a strategy for a specific puzzle
 Ayza: ah I see
 HenroLST: yup, sorry about the vague wording of my question, thanks for responding though!
 Aldoggen: np man&#160;:)
 HenroLST: :slight_smile:
 Aldoggen: lol I wrote up a solution real quick but it stalls at the last test case 
 Aldoggen: quadratic time complexity is not enough apparently
 HenroLST: hm
 Crosility: Just did a CoC, that just was too hard to implement answer in C in 15 minutes.
 Astrobytes: Green circle seems ready to go
 Aldoggen: I do my code challenges in python. wouldn't want to do em in c or java
 eulerscheZahl: if you are sure about it Astrobytes, approve it
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't review it yet. most probably it's fine but no approval without review
 Astrobytes: From my testing it seems OK but I'm not approving it until others have tested it too
 Astrobytes: afk
 wlesavo: is there a way to extract the latest version of code i submitted? i was not serious about this contest so i mostly coded in CG ide
 Crosility: Aldoggen - I'm trying to force-improve some C smoothness. Try to rely less on for loops and if-else if-else trees
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 struct: Then click view report wlesavo
 wlesavo: oh thx
 Aldoggen: Crosility aah all right&#160;:) imo CoC is not really the right tool for that, but you do you. 
 Crosility: I do all the different things on the site. As well as Win programming outside of this.
 jacek: win!?
 Crosility: You gotta practice all facets. Quick execution vs slow and methodical. Vs optimization.
 Crosility: Like, there's the times where, you gotta optimize between "the best way" and a good way. Because it execution becomes too much.
 Crosility: Then you have CoC, where you gotta solve, sometimes, theoretically difficult challenge in a time limit.
 wlesavo: what will happen with bosses after the release? rn in contrib the first league boss seems to be the golden boss (or just some strong bot), while league 3 is dummy, is that ok?
 struct: you mean boss 1?
 wlesavo: yes
 struct: its not the gold boss, its releasing apps on 1st turn
 wlesavo: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: you will be back to wood
 wlesavo: so it is just some bots without any meaning for now?
 eulerscheZahl: and wood1 as the highest league
 wlesavo: oh, ok
 eulerscheZahl: a disappointment, i must admin
 eulerscheZahl: admit
 jacek: so the multi will not have my boss?&#160;:(
 struct: ah 1st league has no automated
 struct: was wondering what my bot was doing
 struct: oh not even play phase
 struct: oh well
 wlesavo: also, will it be only 4/4 apps in wood1 or similar to the bronze?
 struct: it was always 5
 wlesavo: oh you can submit in different leagues
 wlesavo: indeed only 4/4 in the last one
 eulerscheZahl: it's always like that in testing
 eulerscheZahl: see? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/843364c35de5a48f4e0de3a6e0720b74d11b1a">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/843364c35de5a48f4e0de3a6e0720b74d11b1a</a>
 wlesavo: yeah, i think i even new this, but its been too long since i tested smth in contrib
 wlesavo: knew
 StevenV: well, when will we have green circle as a multi?
 eulerscheZahl: when 3 people click on approve
 StevenV: can I click on approve for green-circle?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i have that button
 StevenV: and isn't that the contest will be convert into multi without the need of approve?
 eulerscheZahl: was not an official contest
 StevenV: ah
 eulerscheZahl: i hoped that they would still just move it over to the multiplayer section and keep the bots
 eulerscheZahl: higher bosses will be gone too
 StevenV: well
 eulerscheZahl: and everyone of the 1700 participants has to resubmit
 StevenV: will it still have lengend league?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: wood1 will the the highest
 StevenV:&#160;:(
 wlesavo: there goes my plans on storming legend
 wlesavo: ill probably rather will do smth else
 StevenV: I don't have time to implement a good bot in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: oh, read comments<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1925595a4355ed9c38b46dbc5053f872bd693">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1925595a4355ed9c38b46dbc5053f872bd693</a>
 wlesavo: oh nice
 StevenV: and I can't get to legend on green-circle anymore&#160;:(
 StevenV: I hope that CG can keep the leagues and the bots too
 DevMarcao: is it possible to enable dark mode here?
 struct: it doesnt seem that it will happen StevenV
 struct: yes DevMarcao
 struct: open the ide of any puzzle and go to settings on the left
 StevenV: isn't Thibaud is checking with the technical team?
 struct: how do you know?
 StevenV: the latest comement:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1925595a4355ed9c38b46dbc5053f872bd693">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1925595a4355ed9c38b46dbc5053f872bd693</a>
 StevenV: of Sebastien
 StevenV: so lvl20+ can approve the mult right?
 struct: yes
 struct: But it gets released as a brand new multi, no players, no leagues
 StevenV: Hope CG could do sth different for Green-circle
 eulerscheZahl: and i would still review it as slight changes were made. i assume that all works correctly but i'm not a fan of rushed approvals. at the same time i don't want to review now, so I'll let others do the work for me
 StevenV: yup, we should review it with Green IT philosophy
 therealbeef: and what is that exactly?
 StevenV: I rember top 1 create a lot of technical dev and do a lot of CI
 StevenV: so Green IT = technical dev + CI :D
 StevenV: sorry
 StevenV: technical debt
 therealbeef: and 'life's just random, deal with it'
 StevenV: yup
 StevenV: So I I can, I would review randomly and approve by tossing a coin
 StevenV: ok, so what is the fastest way to increase my lvl without any cheat?
 therealbeef: solving puzzles gains a lot of XP
 therealbeef: (the official ones)
 StevenV: how about achivements?
 therealbeef: some are easy to get, but don't give much XP
 StevenV: thanks
 therealbeef: very hard puzzles give 500 xp or more
 StevenV: and take weeks to solve
 therealbeef: true, but it shouldn't be too easy to gain high level
 Uljahn: the difficulty varies, also your background matters
 eulerscheZahl: what's not worth it for XP farming: creating complex puzzles or multiplayer games. gives the same XP as a clash
 StevenV:&#160;:|
 struct: writing the statement for a multi should be 500xp alone
 StevenV: :D
 Astrobytes: didn't they add leagues to coif though?
 struct: They did but people had to resubmit
 Astrobytes: Better than no leagues at all
 StevenV: coif?
 Astrobytes: Code of Ice &amp; Fire
 StevenV: ah, thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: the acronyms get confusing
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we finally get the wala boss
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 darkhorse64: 2 more to go&#160;!
 StevenV: wala boss?
 darkhorse64: 2 more approvals, I mean
 StevenV: you get the bot of wala for a game?
 eulerscheZahl: you understand nothing
 eulerscheZahl: they opened legend in the contest. they have a script to pick the boss
 darkhorse64: For that, we need CG to do the right thing
 Astrobytes: It was when the error happened with legend league opening StevenV. wala was top in gold and became the boss
 eulerscheZahl: it was faulty, so they took #1 for boss
 Astrobytes: na na :D
 eulerscheZahl: let's call it a draw, astro
 Astrobytes: meh
 eulerscheZahl: i sandwiched you with the explanation
 darkhorse64: nb_of _players in gold / 200 = 0. Oops
 Astrobytes: I'll let you have the draw
 StevenV: ah
 eulerscheZahl: may StevenV decide if it's a draw then
 Astrobytes: That may require further explanation
 eulerscheZahl: not competing to explain that
 StevenV: so I do a coin toss?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: If you like. I'll go heads
 eulerscheZahl: i take the building then
 StevenV: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://flipsimu.com/?id=fyDbq">https://flipsimu.com/?id=fyDbq</a>

 eulerscheZahl: my contest bot had this issue too
 eulerscheZahl: RIP mirror matches
 eulerscheZahl: oh right: we can't automate
 Astrobytes: ah yeah
 eulerscheZahl: my bot doesn't work like this :poop:
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i'll be a wood noob then. getting hungry
 eulerscheZahl: oh, should try 1st action
 Westicles: ha, let's just freeze it here
 wlesavo: there wont be mirrors for multi?
 Astrobytes: apparently not? No idea why. Maybe if they introduce proper leagues they'll do that too
 wlesavo: may be only in the wood1?
 struct: Only cg can add mirrored 
 Astrobytes: And leagues. That's who I mean. 
 YurkovAS: where my +4k CP? :thinking:
 jacek: i just print 1st action
 jacek: and how come there are 4 wood leagues? there were only 2 and bronze?
 Astrobytes: Thibaud is checking with the devs if we can get proper leagues...

 Wishbone: Mathematically speaking, isn't a triangle valid even if it has two angles of 0 and one of 180?
 Wishbone: Granted, you can't see it as anything but a line visually, but mathematically speaking it is still three segments connected at the ends.
 mannouao: Westicles why you didn't beat the w2 boss&#160;???
 Astrobytes: isn't area something to do with the definition Wishbone?
 Westicles: no idea
 mannouao: you win every time vs him
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: Area = 0.
 Astrobytes: That's what I mean, it needs area to be a triangle
 Astrobytes: mathematically speaking
 jacek: degenerate triangle
 Astrobytes: I see, fair
 struct: I only know that it needs at least 4 sides to be a triangle
 Wishbone: jacek, yes, apparently that is the term.
 Astrobytes: we don't use those in cell biology :P
 eulerscheZahl: promoted with first action
 Astrobytes: ugh
 JFB: to legend???
 eulerscheZahl: to wood3
 JFB: uff
 eulerscheZahl: oof
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Astrobytes: ouph
 Westicles: darkhorse64 what is going on
 eulerscheZahl: you'll get kicked in what fr calls you soon enough
 Wishbone: Why do people go out of their way to use silly characters in the inputs of puzzles?
 Astrobytes: boules de l'ouest?
 Astrobytes: Or is there a more insulting recent one?
 Wishbone: From the Logic Gates puzzle: "Signals are represented with underscore and minus characters, an undescore matching a low level (0, or false) and a minus matching a high level (1, or true)"
 Westicles: mostly just W, but they call wonton that as well and confuse each other
 Wishbone: Why not just use 0 and 1 then?
 Wishbone: It seems like the first part of most puzzles is to convert deliberately awkward data points into useable ones.
 Wishbone: That gets old really quick.
 mannouao: where is w1 boss&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there is none, only CG can add leagues above wood
 mannouao: whay spider attack have leagues above wood&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It was an official contest. This one was a hybrid of sponsored and community-made contest
 mannouao: ow i see thanks

 GNye22: I have a list of ascii values

 jacek: :tada:
 xGuGu: :thumbsup_tone1:
 Astrobytes: think first, code second 
 Ayza: well said
 eulerscheZahl: America first
 Crosility: -.-
 visionspider: its just i havent had to use math in a while so I lost some of my ability of translating plain english into math
 MrZee: Math is the hardest language of all
 Crosility: ... Welcome to programming/coding. Little bit of math, but complex concepts understanding is required :D
 KarterFX: shhh
 jacek: math, not even once
 Crosility: Lol jacek. Such lies.
 visionspider: I find that the instructions in code clash are sometimes poorly written.
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: they are!
 eulerscheZahl: false incentives. a quest map asking every user to create a clash and to approve one
 eulerscheZahl: too much work to keep up with moderation and correct those
 eulerscheZahl: and then you give reasonable feedback what can be approved. and the next clown approves with "i like it"
 Crosility: Well - the point it takes to REACH that node on the map, is pretty far in.
 Astrobytes: ^^^^ this alllllllll day long
 Astrobytes: (euler's comment)
 eulerscheZahl: unfortunately my puzzle search website is offline for a few more hours. could show you a graph of new contributions over time
 Astrobytes: Not far enough if you ask me Crosility :D
 Ayza: for some reason none of them choose to reject contributions even though the roadmap clearly says they can
 Ayza: so why approve a really bad contribution
 Crosility: Probably not Astrobytes. BUT, hey, been here a month~ (Well, over 2 years by profile age). I've done at least a puzzle / day, and some optimization, AI, and a dozen clashes. I don't even have approval step done, let alone this "make a CoC".
 Astrobytes: hehehe not criticizing Crosility
 eulerscheZahl: psychology. when you refuse, the creator is sad
 Crosility: I wonder though, what does the node say, get a CoC approved? OR just create one?
 eulerscheZahl: when you approve, 100 clashers are. but those are "anonymous" to the approver
 Ayza: you gotta get a coc approved Crosility
 Ayza: If it was creating a contribution we'd get a lot of trolls
 Astrobytes: like...
 visionspider: Any thoughts on this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f8689d2-68d4-4df1-b91a-ef9ce598ddc8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f8689d2-68d4-4df1-b91a-ef9ce598ddc8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and castles?
 Crosility: visionspider, use actual pastebin website
 Astrobytes: yes euler, you were later than I expected with that response
 Ayza: trolls vs castles lol
 visionspider: yeah i didnt try to use the pastebin it just auto pastebined it sadly
 Ayza: talking about that I haven't seen it anymore
 visionspider: input: cCnNoOoutput: 1 3 5
 Ayza: It automatically makes long text a pastebin visionspider
 Astrobytes: visionspider: auto pastebins are broken I think, either use less linebreaks or use 'proper' pastebin
 Ayza: as astro said
 jacek: visionspider is this reverse?
 Crosility: Is modulus (operator) a known term to all programmers? (Just curious)
 Astrobytes: output uppercase letters?
 visionspider: input: NunnjN32,.output: 0 5
 jacek: positions of uppercase letters
 visionspider: its a reverse
 visionspider: oh i see
 visionspider: you are right
 visionspider: im so blind
 Astrobytes: jacek: slowpoke :P
 jacek: oO
 visionspider: i was thinking it was something related to the ASCII code and to subtract it
 Astrobytes: Crosility: I would hope so
 Ayza: probably Crosility
 Ayza: well I did learn it after I got into codingame
 Ayza: seen people using it
 Astrobytes: visionspider: think simple first before complicating things
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes 09:05ᴾᴹyes euler, you were later than I expected with that response
 Astrobytes: ah, I love that movie
 Crosility: But it's a fairly needed thing, so using it in a description, should be understood by the average programmer.
 Crosility: Thanks, :P
 Astrobytes: pretty sure I did something about modular arithmetic in school
 Astrobytes: highschool I mean
 Astrobytes: maybe it was later, who knows. But people should most definitely know what n&#160;% m represents
 eulerscheZahl: in arithmetic school?
 Astrobytes: Yes euler. Arithmetic school.
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: integer division?
 eulerscheZahl: comes between highschool and college
 RiemannUchiha: wtf is arithmetic school&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: modulo is the remainder of integer division
 eulerscheZahl: 7&#160;% 3 = 1as 7 / 3 = 2 with 1 remaining
 darkhorse64: Great! Triple jump with 3 lines added to the stub
 visionspider: thanks for the advise
 visionspider: advice*
 Wishbone: Ah, I can never remember that operator. It is exceedingly rare that I need to use it.
 visionspider: I tend to always overcomplicate
 j4at: modulo is very useful
 RiemannUchiha: maths* are very useful
 visionspider: anyone here who primarly codes in Javascript?
 Wishbone: j4at: Not in integration, which is my field of work.
 Astrobytes: You do calculus for a living?
 visionspider: im tired of looking at Python solutions, would like to play and compare to someone else who uses JS
 jacek: make puzzles in js and see solutions of others
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: Integration - the pursuit of facilitating communication between different computer systems.
 Astrobytes: Wishbone: I was joking&#160;;)
 j4at: well maybe stop using js because it's not a real programming language
 jacek: not about integrals?
 Astrobytes: I never joke about integrals
 visionspider: I can see others solutions in puzzles section?
 RiemannUchiha: Actually as an applied mathematics engineer, without maths i can't eat bro
 jacek: you feel indifferent about them?
 visionspider: or only for puzzles i created?
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: it can be hard to tell. Most people have no idea what I'm talking about when I tell them what I do&#160;;-)
 Wishbone: visionspider: JS is a war crime&#160;;-)
 jacek: visionspider yes, if you solve them
 visionspider: oh ok ive solved a few
 visionspider: let me check it out
 Astrobytes: Wishbone: Considering I'm not even a proper dev I find that disturbing
 visionspider: lol
 jacek: j4at nice search race result
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: You do know that "most people" aren't devs at all, right?
 j4at: thank you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: If I didn't know what integration was I could get into management dammit
 j4at: not good enough tho :p
 Wishbone: Ugh, management...
 visionspider: JS is easy, and a good precursor to TS
 jacek: j4at youre ahead of toad, that should be enough
 j4at: hehe
 Wishbone: Man, I'm having to use TS at work right now. Hating that too.
 visionspider: lol
 visionspider: what do you normally use
 Wishbone: I am NOT a frontend developer.
 visionspider: I hear a lot from JS devs how java is a war crime
 Wishbone: C# and SQL.
 Astrobytes: Management across most disciplines is the same: atrociously unqualified people making decisions about things they have and do not care to have knowledge about
 visionspider: oh you are a .NET user
 visionspider: you can still do a backend with JS
 Astrobytes: Java is a warcrime but compared to JS it's almost sane.
 visionspider: lol
 Wishbone: visionspider: I have absolutely no desire to use JS for ANYTHING&#160;;-)
 j4at: C# &gt; python ~= C ~= C++ &gt;  JAVA ~= TS &gt; JS
 j4at: tier list
 Wishbone: Not sure I'd equate C and C++...
 Astrobytes: Every tool in its right place I say, use what you need, no more, no less
 Wishbone: I've never used Python though.
 visionspider: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pics.me.me/drunk-member-this-is-my-favorite-javascript-language-redcoders-11-62100635.png">https://pics.me.me/drunk-member-this-is-my-favorite-javascript-language-redcoders-11-62100635.png</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, at least TS did something to that end
 Wishbone: Yup, that's one of the reasons I hate JS. The damn inconsistencies.
 visionspider: j4at you should add abap in that list lol
 Wishbone: And don't get me started on JSON and REST...
 visionspider: I hear a lot of JS devs who love rust though
 Astrobytes: shouldn't that correct them out of using JS?
 visionspider: depends on work i guess
 struct: Those are devs that just dont want to say they like C++
 visionspider: lol
 Astrobytes: Wouldn't the borrow checker beat down JS devs until they cried?
 Wishbone: Oh man, now you've got me thinking about all the langs/techs I have issues with&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: I'm only kidding anyway, like I say, tools are tools
 Wishbone: Like LUA...
 visionspider: I think one of the reasons it is loved is because of the generous errors?
 Astrobytes: You can hammer a nail in with a wrench but...
 eulerscheZahl: Wishbone 09:21ᴾᴹC# and SQL.
 visionspider: lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, anything but Lua
 eulerscheZahl: and blazor. whatever it takes to avoid SQL and JS
 Wishbone: eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: Wishbone&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Are you still using Blazor at work euler?
 Wishbone: SQL is great. It's logical and does what it's supposed to.
 eulerscheZahl: yes astro. even used it for a desktop application recently
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 eulerscheZahl: just a webview in WPF and blazor for everything inside
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't even my idea to take that path but i like it
 j4at: eulerscheZahl  get good. You are behind me in search race
 eulerscheZahl: you are behind me at STC, fix it
 j4at:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: and fix your understanding of games euler cares about too j4at. ezpz
 eulerscheZahl: i started using these, makes life really easy<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://mudblazor.com/components/table#api">https://mudblazor.com/components/table#api</a>
 eulerscheZahl: then i found a bug. turned out someone reported it on github 3 months ago, still no reaction&#160;:(
 Wishbone: Nothing better than having to use non-maintained 3rd party frameworks&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: only 674 open issues :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: damn, would be nice if that was maintained
 eulerscheZahl: looks really pretty
 eulerscheZahl: but then you do a basic thing like enabling virtualization in a large table (which is built-in and well documented). combine that with multi-select and in breaks on scrolling
 Astrobytes: beats some python framework, bootstrap and times new roman
 eulerscheZahl: it's based on materialize
 eulerscheZahl: or just material? not sure about the name :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's the one i stumbled over<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/4321">https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/4321</a>
 Astrobytes: One is the google one and one is the other iirc
 eulerscheZahl: they both exist? that explains my confusion
 Astrobytes: iirc yes
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a horrible frontend dev. all i know: it looks pretty
 Astrobytes: back on track though, the Blazor desktop app setup seems cool. Beats HTA anyway :P :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: colleagues really liked it when i shared my screen. and that was a laggy screen sharing, even looks better with the animations when you use it on your own device
 eulerscheZahl: there's only one thing i'm really sad about:
 eulerscheZahl: there is .net MAUI for cross platform. android, ios, macos, windows
 eulerscheZahl: just no linux
 Astrobytes: I saw you or someone mention that recently
 Astrobytes: Why though? 
 eulerscheZahl: linux is small in end users, probably not worth the time to build it
 eulerscheZahl: they forget developers, linux is quite common there
 Astrobytes: Seems kind of strange tbh, even with that explanation
 eulerscheZahl: official statement was something like "we have a strong community how can do it for us"
 Astrobytes: ah, that's the one
 YurkovAS: Referee source code not available in block the spreading fire?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7604aa367ebf04432ec6bb6bcd4831ed6655">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7604aa367ebf04432ec6bb6bcd4831ed6655</a>
 Astrobytes: "we can't be arsed, you do it if you want it so much"
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS: do you need it?
 Astrobytes: Rules seem simple enough
 YurkovAS: yes, i'm use it for test with validators
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Isn't it an optimization game?  kinda defeats purpose
 struct: it's not possible to download it, you can still get the validators though
 struct: all you need to do is press test in ide
 struct: on the contribution
 Astrobytes: ^
 Wishbone: Is it petty of me that it bugs me to no end that in the Logic Gates puzzle, the XNOR gate is called "NXOR"?
 eulerscheZahl: not petty, reasonable
 YurkovAS: eh. it is easier with a unit test: which itself will read all validators and test the bot
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea about the context but just reading NXOR annoys me
 Wishbone: Good, it's not just me then.
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of Nixon
 Astrobytes: I have never ever ever seen NXOR until today
 Wishbone: Nor have I.
 jacek: not even when you made NN?
 Wishbone: Or should I say, XNOR have I&#160;:-D
 jacek: :drum:
 Astrobytes: you stole my joke theme!
 eulerscheZahl: what puzzle is that?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wishbone: Logic Gates
 Astrobytes: this is the one with _ and - for 0 and 1?
 Wishbone: Yes.
 Wishbone: That's annoying too.
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles approved, explain yourself&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I remember seeing you post about it earlier, does that serve any purpose?
 Astrobytes: lol euler, well played :D
 Wishbone: What, posting about it?
 Astrobytes: Wishbone: lol no, getting the input like that
 Wishbone: It serves the purpose of letting me vent my frustrations&#160;:-D
 Wishbone: No, no purpose. b0n5a1 apparently just decided that that was better than using 0 and 1. The output needs to be like that as well.
 Astrobytes: oh if the output is like that, that makes a little more sense
 Wishbone: Dunno if it's supposed to emulate testing individual logic gates using an oscilloscope.
 Astrobytes: Quite possibly
 Wishbone: But the goal description even says: "Signals are represented with underscore and minus characters, an undescore matching a low level (0, or false) and a minus matching a high level (1, or true)."
 Astrobytes: there's no suitable vertical char other than |, so _|-|_
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that's a funny issue<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/4777">https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/4777</a>
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should not rely on that framework for future projects
 Astrobytes: Intriguing placement there
 HenroLST: ...
 struct: that puzzle was clash difficulty
 struct: imo
 struct: no math = clash
 Astrobytes: RIGHT. Enough with this 'math' shit. It's 'maths' dammit! :D
 Astrobytes: I would call chemistry chems if it was chemistries!
 Astrobytes: but I call it chem cause it isn't!
 Astrobytes: &lt;/rant&gt;
 struct: well in portuguese is Matemática
 struct: no s
 Astrobytes: Let me have my English-speaking moment!
 Astrobytes: dammit
 Wishbone: Either I'm stupid, or the puzzle discussion interface is really unintuitive.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, that's acceptable. What about the americans?
 Wishbone: For the life of me I can't figure out how to post a comment.
 struct: I can't speak for Americans 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: countries = c*nts
 Astrobytes: Wishbone: there is a lot wrong with the whole approval system tbh lol
 Wishbone: In the "Discussions" tab on a puzzle.
 struct: Wishbone which puzzle?
 Wishbone: Logic Gates, but I assume the interface is the same for every puzzle. Otherwise this site is coded really weirdly.
 struct: Was I supposed to solve that puzzle without using &amp; | ^?
 Astrobytes: ohhh wait, is this the disappearing comment submission forum bug again?
 Wishbone: I can WRITE a post, but there does not appear to be any button to actually post it.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe it's wish's lvl
 jacek: do you have get a job bar at the top
 jacek: close it
 Wishbone: No, should I?
 jacek: oh
 Astrobytes: They got rid of that jacek
 Wishbone: Ohhh...
 Astrobytes: apparently
 jacek: something like that could hide the reply button
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't mouseover wish's icon to see lvl
 Wishbone: What the actual... That is some of the most shitty website design I've seen in quite a while.
 Astrobytes: Please feel free to let them know Wishbone :D
 struct: I dont leave the stc ide so its fine for me
 Wishbone: And on a coding website, no less&#160;:-(
 Aldoggen: I can't either
 Astrobytes: struct: heheeh back at it again :D
 struct: nah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, if u are lvl 3 I don't think u can post.  keep pissed off spammers fro... blah blah
 Wishbone: But yes, closing the thing at the top (which said something completely different for me) made the window rise up, bringing the button onto the screen.
 Astrobytes: Patrick, as far as I can tell Wishbone has not been spamming
 Wishbone: I don't think I have either.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just can't mouseovere their icon to get any info, that is wierd
 Astrobytes: It happens a lot these days Patrick
 jacek: is this the last hours of the chat?
 Wishbone: It's not showing my portrait in the chat either.
 Astrobytes: Not sure jacek, did they put a date on it? I think they said sometime in June
 Astrobytes: Devs are at a conference currently (from Thibaud) so I guess we find out when they get back
 Wishbone: What, is the chat getting removed?
 j4at: yeah, sadly&#160;:(
 Wishbone: Any explanation why?
 HenroLST: wait whaaaa
 Astrobytes: Expensive and/or resource-intensive to maintain or upgrade
 jacek: supposed to be closed in mid june but keeps going
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Isn';t there a list of lvl abilities somewhere....like lvl 3 allows chat, lvl 6 ... something ... lvl 20 ... something
 Wishbone: I'm currently lvl 10, if that's helpful.
 Astrobytes: Since the takeover by CoderPad they only have kinda limited resources to work on the free part of the site (this part) as the focus is on the profitable side (CGForWork)
 Astrobytes: Sad for us but understandable in the scheme of things
 Wishbone: Well, that will certainly lessen the site's appeal for me.
 Astrobytes: Numerous solutions have been touted such as open-sourcing the chat to the community etc but although the will is there I doubt it will come to anything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think it lends to the open source side of things, so fewer programmers tumble around int he dark
 Wishbone: I've only been here two days, but I've come to appreciate this chat a lot.
 Astrobytes: The discord will still be there
 Astrobytes: But it's kinda dead barring the odd question, bug report or occasional large discussion
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someone was working on a maven chat, forgot who
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: which is fine for those with multi-monitor setups. Sadly I'm not one of those.
 struct: We need to create a petition
 Astrobytes: I have dual monitors and still prefer the webchat tbh (and I changed my mind on that over the past... year? I think)
 struct: But I'm too lazy
 HenroLST: we go on strike
 struct: I already did
 Astrobytes: We need to riot struct. It's the French way. Protest, strike, lie down in the server room corridors
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have 3 monitors.  But still hate discord eating my resources
 Wishbone: Could they integrate one of the discord channels in place of the chat?
 struct: No thanks Astro, I heard french police is on par with american
 Astrobytes: afaik discord isn't embeddable 
 Wishbone: Pity.
 Astrobytes: struct: yes, pretty close
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and when i goto discord all my other group chats they are a pain to switch around
 Astrobytes: we'll use that group channel on discord when the chat goes but it won't be the same
 Astrobytes: some of us will use it at least
 Wishbone: #codingame or #talk-about-anything-here?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all mu local buddies just use discord to talk about starins of weed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er strains.... and I don't smoke anymore
 Astrobytes: got a separate one Wishbone
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII lol, that's like both my Grateful Dead discord channels
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: Oh, an entirely different server, or?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I make trippy LED signs for them, so I can't block channels
 Astrobytes: Yeah Wishbone
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I monitor right wing chats sometimes on discord to see just how Nazi things are getting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's very sad btw
 Eandy11: How do I see everyone's solution after a coding clash
 Aldoggen: they have to choose to share it
 Eandy11: dang
 Eandy11: I had no clue what to do
 Eandy11: that whole time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: been working on reworking  galleon wars bot, it's not going well
 Aldoggen: @Eandy11 if you still know the goal statement I can try to write something
 Eandy11: Is there anyway I can look back at my old coding clashes?
 Aldoggen: afaik no
 Astrobytes: You can look up the clashes if you remember them but the site is currently offline until I think tomorrow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My dad wants me to do the ncestry dna to see if he has any other grandchildren ... like wtf ... it's possible ... but what's wrong with the one u got?
 Astrobytes: that's his sole reasoning? :D

 Eandy11: yup
 Eandy11: lol
 Eandy11: yea these challenges make me feel stupid, I just stare at them for so long
 jacek: hm
 HenroLST: mh
 kollaboys: this is so easy
 Andriamanitra: It's been almost an hour since i got fucked over by this but I'm still angry at this clash <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2067557fd6992ee5bd05914f3de809be1f786">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2067557fd6992ee5bd05914f3de809be1f786</a>
 Andriamanitra: what the fuck does 8 months and 27 days mean in a sane world where ill-defined methods like .NET's "AddMonths" don't exist
 Ayza: ah that clash I've got it aswell
 Ayza: couldn't solve it in time its annoying
 Ayza: maybe its just me but I had to deal with months with 30 days and 31 days
 Andriamanitra: yeah it's basically impossible to figure out what it means
 Andriamanitra: it's so stupid too because i'm pretty sure the length of a pregnancy doesn't chance depending on how long the next 9 months happen to be
 Ayza: I guess it could've been about something other than pregnancy
 Andriamanitra: even then "8 months" is a not a well-defined amount of time
 Ayza: then again you have the approvers who probably didn't solve the puzzle but think it's good
 Andriamanitra: look at python: timedelta doesn't accept months
 Andriamanitra: look at D: dur doesn't accept months
 Andriamanitra: D*
 Astrobytes: D? All hail the D. I miss the D memes
 Andriamanitra: i can't even decide if i'm more angry at the author of the clash or .NET for implementing that method making this possible
 Westicles: He's not the brightest guy
 Westicles: He gave me endless hell about my mpox contrib
 Westicles: Then smurfed approvals for his own, looks like
 Ayza: your mpox contribution was cool, just couldn't solve it for some reason
 Ayza: and due to my 0 understanding of c++ i couldn't implement your code
 Andriamanitra: the clash is bad but i wouldn't accuse him of smurfing, the approval process is just broken
 Westicles: two blank accounts with no friends is usually smurfs
 Ayza: it's all the roadmap's fault :pensive:
 Ayza: usually low levels do it for the roadmap
 Wishbone: Westicles: To be fair, I've commented on it, I have a blank account and no friends, but my comment was a criticism&#160;;-)
 Westicles: Wishbone, you account is more than blank, it doesn't even seem to exist :P
 Wishbone: I assure you I'm a real person&#160;:-D

 Eandy11: Given a list of numbers, output the second smallest number.
 Eandy11: anyone done this one before?
 Eandy11: I struggle with the fastest mode ones
 struct: arr.sort()[1]?
 Wishbone: It's odd though, the clash comments do show my portrait, but this chat doesn't.
 struct: oh wont work
 struct: arr.sort.uniq[1]
 Eandy11: do we have to use the code that these challenges start us with/
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: Might be a caching thing Wishbone, either CG or us :D
 Westicles: Ayza, seems like not everybody is used to taking the odds of several independent things happening and turning that into the odds of none of them happening
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 DomiKo: struct
 DomiKo: your bot is much stronger&#160;:(
 struct: yes?
 Astrobytes: Westicles: Making Babies Properly. New puzzle? 
 struct: and its the same bot...
 struct: of last submit
 DomiKo: me too&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: don't get too worried in a league like that DomiKo
 Astrobytes: Wait for the real leagues
 Westicles: Astro, I'll let you take that one
 struct: but yeah no mirrored matches and too many strategies
 Astrobytes: :D
 DomiKo: I don't have time to worry :joy:
 Astrobytes: ah prep for the internship was it?
 struct: Still my bot is on par with legend bots
 DomiKo: yeah
 struct: It just didnt pass :p
 DomiKo: I have my flight tomorrow
 struct: for the internship?
 Astrobytes: good luck DomiKo, hope everything goes great. Where and what you doing? If you are ok to say
 struct: gl
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: Google Zurich, optimizing some stuff 
 Astrobytes: Nice! Sounds promising dude, smash that shit&#160;:)
 DomiKo: Thanks!
 DomiKo: I hope I will be around here much more than lately
 DomiKo: I have soo much stuff to improve and on my todo list
 Astrobytes: everything in good time DomiKo, no rush
 DomiKo: that's true
 Illedan: Work really gets in the way of CG&#160;:) But GL!
 DomiKo: Site won't disappear :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 DomiKo: For me studies gets a bit more in the way
 DomiKo: But we will see
 DomiKo: gn for today, and see you in some time!
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: The definition of life is that it gets in the way of your plans :D
 Astrobytes: and gn DomiKo
 Westicles: hah, they just called me burnes du ponant,
 Westicles: too subtle for google translate
 struct: It means love in French
 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: no, no I don't think it does :D
 darkhorse64: nice little cheering words from your french friends
 Astrobytes: At least you're not called Brice Westicles
 darkhorse64: Cassé
 Astrobytes: Fun fact: worked with an Italian bar man who was literally Brice de Nice. I was alerted to this by the (French) head barman
 Astrobytes: Work was never the same until he left
 Westicles: third-rate gigolo?  ha
 makerecho: Panoplie du casseur
 makerecho: brice de nice brings me back to high school memories :D 
 darkhorse64: :sleeping: for me
 Astrobytes: Made me laugh as a non-French
 Astrobytes: (when I understood it)
 Astrobytes: The film or you're saying goodnight darkhorse64?

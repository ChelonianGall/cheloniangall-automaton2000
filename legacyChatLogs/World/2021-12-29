 PatrickMcGinnisII: ha changed profile
 PatrickMcGinnisII: aww still shows old pic in chat

 BlaiseEbuth: 25^4=390625
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 How to properly guess a question
 Automaton2000: im trying to do it here
 eulerscheZahl: 4 = 2²25 = 5²390625 = 625²
 eulerscheZahl: oh, only "4" is the output, not all 3 lines
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth slaps eulerscheZahl around a bit with a large 'reading comprehension' tag.</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> Idk.-_-: but its reverse mode its accept 2 inputone of them was

 eulerscheZahl: the non-reverse version of the clash
 JBM: no one is
 Idk.-_-: and wich way good for practice&#160;?puzzle or clash of code 
 Blokops: yes
 5DN1L: why not both
 eulerscheZahl: i'd recommend anything on this website but clashes. and escapes
 Blokops: porque no los dos
 eulerscheZahl: English please
 eulerscheZahl: or go to the #es channel
 Blokops: wooosh
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't play to the mod toad...
 5DN1L: Just pay
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, overstepping my competences
 Idk.-_-: 5DN1L you are in god mod :D lv 38
 5DN1L: Huh? God mod?
 eulerscheZahl: and he got to that level really quick
 eulerscheZahl: good mood with missing o's
 BlaiseEbuth: Cheater heh...
 eulerscheZahl: no, not implying any of that
 5DN1L: :shrug:
 Idk.-_-: y im typing fast and missing some  .....
 Idk.-_-:&#160;:()
 BlaiseEbuth: What JBM came do here btw eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i was initially suspicious (too many other users ruined my faith in honest work)
 Assasint: #Clash
 eulerscheZahl: but i told thibaud to check before promoting him to mod to which he agreed. now 5DN1L is a mod, so for me the case is closed, sorry for distrusting you at first
 BlaiseEbuth: If you're not honest you don't need to work... :smirk:
 5DN1L: It's understandable eulerscheZahl
 5DN1L: Fine by me
 eulerscheZahl: great&#160;:)
 Assasint: What are you talking
 Idk.-_-: lv 55 :no_mouth:
 BlaiseEbuth: Except if tibo is accomplice...
 5DN1L: who's tibo
 Uljahn: :sweat_smile:
 BlaiseEbuth: Too far in the negation 5DN1L... You're spotted.
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if you are kidding or not. Thibaud is pronounced like tibo
 5DN1L: i was suspecting that a few seconds after i typed that question :P
 eulerscheZahl: French spelling, glad I chose Latin in school
 BlaiseEbuth: Sibawoo?
 Assasint: What a heck guys
 Assasint: Are you hetre
 Assasint: To treat
 Assasint:  Kids
 Assasint:  I am  a aldult
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway. Since he doesn't work, he's de facto not honest and so suspect.
 Assasint: What did you say
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII would abuse mod</b></p><p><img src="/a/75612729571417" /> Assasint: What why do you pick that name
 eulerscheZahl: his parents did
 Assasint: really

 e_fishel: hello 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 103 notifications, i haven't logged in for awhile
 e_fishel: woah
 Wontonimo: hey Patrick
 Wontonimo: hey e_fishel
 Wontonimo: oh, look, a bunch of regulars are on
 e_fishel: am i a regular?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: been a few weeks for me, holidays have been .... interesting
 Schwase: whats a CG pro account?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: happy to do a puzzle today
 Wontonimo: I think the pro account is for recruiters Schwase 
 Schwase: oh yikes
 Schwase: i was hoping i could get it for free if i did like a survey or something and then i could play the coding escape puzzles i never got to try
 Schwase: rip
 e_fishel: is there such a thing as a clash of code addict?
 Schwase: alec man
 jacek: oO
 Blabbage: lol
 e_fishel: alright
 e_fishel: good bye
 Blabbage: bye
 bayo: I am begginer around here I love programming especially in python any advice
 e_fishel: make a project
 e_fishel: how about a discord bot in python
 e_fishel:&#160;:|
 e_fishel: that's all i got
 bayo: Good idea thanks. 
 e_fishel: have fun
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: bayo, try an easy puzzle and ask a series of 100 questions that Wontonimo will answer
 Schwase: python has totally ruined me
 Schwase: i used to know java
 jacek: oO
 jacek: easy puzzles: the descent, power of thor, temperatures
 e_fishel: don't use python for every single thing you can think of
 Schwase: explain?
 e_fishel: don't put python inside the software of a blender
 e_fishel: use c++ instead
 aetrnm: Evening chat!
 aetrnm: Is there a way to speed up battles in puzzles?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: You could lose on the first move...
 Schwase: optimize your code?
 MACKEYTH: Schwase Python is a lot better than Java for code golf.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: code golf is judged by language, so doesn't really matter
 MACKEYTH: I've been fighting with Don't Panic and I can't seem to get my Java solution under 400 chars
 MACKEYTH: So many variables to read...
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: huh, my DP in java is actually java
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: is this still the shortest?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: import java.util.*;interface Player{static void main(String[]a){code}}
 aetrnm: What is code golf? Is it a mode?
 aetrnm: I am new to codingame, don't judge ^^
 VizGhar: It is game mode - Activities -&gt; Compete -&gt; Code GolfYou have to write solution in least amount of characters
 VizGhar: anticoding&#160;:)
 VizGhar: and welcome aetrnm
 Schwase: "new to CG", is lvl 17
 Schwase: hmmmm
 Dv4s1on: This challenge just didn't make much sense.. Just deleted all of my whitespaces, comments and declared single letter variables and wrote all of my code just in one line
 Mixo_the_gamer_123: how to do anything lol there is literally no tutorial if there is where is it i just want to learn how to code games
 VizGhar: this is no site to learn how to code games
 VizGhar: Dv4s1on which language?
 VizGhar: you can minimize your code by looking for codegolf tips for your language. Another tip is to ignore as much inputs as possible. You can also exploit how the testcases are made. For example in power of thor there are only 3 directions used in final test case
 e_fishel: is there any way to visualize clash of code replays?
 ninjadip: i think learning how to code the AI in pod racing can help someone learn how to do it in their own game
 Manchi_o6o7: Is there anyone who could share 10 minutes with me to help me with some OOP project. Just to check the ideas.
 DialFrost: morning guys
 Litorax: night
 DialFrost: anyone can tell me why math.abs doesnt work in lua
 ____Z_X_C____: bruh how many language mus t you use?
 DialFrost: all
 DialFrost: &lt;33
 Rob-G: HTML is only language you need
 Astrobytes: French is useful.
 DialFrost: haha nice astro
 Astrobytes: regarding Lua math.abs... I see no reason why it shouldn't work
 Astrobytes: It's not a language I like but on testing with print(math.abs(-2)) I get 2
 DialFrost: i used math.abs in an if statement
 Astrobytes: most likely a logic error on your part then
 DialFrost: hmm
 DialFrost: looks fine to me
 DialFrost: do u want me to send
 Astrobytes: paste it here
 DialFrost: if (math.abs(t) &lt; math.abs(min) or (math.abs(t) == math.abs(min) and t &gt; min))
 Astrobytes: paste it all if you can please, there is no context here
 DialFrost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8358f594-8241-4586-8ae6-8d350fa9a411">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8358f594-8241-4586-8ae6-8d350fa9a411</a>
 Astrobytes: you need to rethink that logic a lil bit
 Astrobytes: what are you trying to solve anyway?
 DialFrost: its kinda obv
 DialFrost: the puzzle temperatures
 Astrobytes: No, it's far from obvious, I solved that years ago.
 Astrobytes: You are not storing your temperatures outside of that loop
 Astrobytes: and where is min?
 DialFrost: eh
 DialFrost: whoops
 Astrobytes: and you will print n times in  that loop
 DialFrost: it works now
 DialFrost: thx astro sry lol
 Astrobytes: all good
 Astrobytes: just remember, if something doesn't work, blame yourself first before blaming the tools
 DialFrost: hmm
 DialFrost: i knew smh was wrong at firts
 DialFrost: cldnt find out y

 shankes: best of luck
 rekaxem: #clash
 rekaxem: sorry wrong chat
 Wontonimo: you will suffer for your insolence rekaxem&#160;!
 Wontonimo: well, probably not.  
 rekaxem: :scream:
 mainman: is it possible to reset a league to start coding again?
 Wontonimo: nope.  you are stuck
 Wontonimo: ah rats, rekaxem is level 12.  I can only ban people below level 10
 Wontonimo: - stole Struct's joke.  actually i can ban anyone
 mainman: oh might need to create a new account to start all over again
 rekaxem: why do you want to do that though
 Wontonimo: i'm just kidding rekaxem.  sorry if it scared you
 Wontonimo: i know, these CG accounts are sooo coveted 
 mainman: worked on Cyborg Uprising 8 months ago and forgot all the rules and wanted to recode from scratch
 Wontonimo: no, don't do that mainman 
 Wontonimo: the early levels usually just suck anyways.  it's great you are at a higher level already

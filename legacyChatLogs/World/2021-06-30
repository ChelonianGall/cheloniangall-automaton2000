 nproger: hello
 Tylr: hello
 nuggetbucket54: hello
 lpseesall: This Horse racing is kicking my butt, when it get to The Final Test case
 KiwiTae: lpseesall you prob check every pairs instead of adjacent numbers
 Seankim123: hello
 DeividasB: Ipseesall you need to sort the array so the horse1 - horse 2 cant be less than horse horse 1 - horse 3, then only check one horse once, 1-2 2-3 3-4 and so on or vice versa
 DeividasB: something like that :D
 chickenpary_one: hello
 chickenpary_one: this is game very hard
 Prime4563: Is this chat active at all?
 tabud: it is 
 Prime4563: GREAT
 Prime4563: Yea i am very new to coding but i have such a big will to learn it, stuck at a problem and wonder if anyone could explain it
 Prime4563: The "int n; // the number of temperatures to analyse
 Prime4563: Do i change the n to the actual amount of numbers?
 Prime4563: Or do i add like  [14]
 tabud: sorry, I did not do this one yet 
 Prime4563: how does the "int" work&#160;?
 Uljahn: no, it's a declaration of a variable to be read from inputs later
 sprkrd: n is given as an input, you read it with cin &gt;&gt; (C++) or with scanf (C)
 Prime4563: any simple way?
 c0nc4c: what language are you coding in?
 Prime4563: c++
 Prime4563: should i change?
 c0nc4c: lol c++ is one of the hardest one. but ok
 Prime4563: hhahah oh 
 c0nc4c: if you are new i suggest starting with Python
 Uljahn: maybe you should learn the basics of a language first
 DaNinja: dont need to change n
 sprkrd: Uljahn +1
 sprkrd: Maybe do a tutorial of the language, since your doubts are not about "Temperatures" at all
 Prime4563: oh so n = int()14))&#160;?
 sprkrd: they're more about the fundamentals of the language
 sprkrd: no, like cin &gt;&gt; n
 c0nc4c: i think you should learn the language first before solving problems here
 Prime4563: Is the any tutorial on this page?
 sprkrd: but as I said, I think you should start  with a tutorial somewhere else instead of jumping directly to solve problems
 c0nc4c: no but there are plenty of resources
 c0nc4c: if you want to learn c++
 sprkrd: Not about the basics, no. Tutorials here are about more advanced topics
 c0nc4c: you can try learncpp.com
 c0nc4c: when you are good at the basics, you can start solving problems
 Prime4563: Thx for the tip!
 c0nc4c: if you are new to programming all together i suggest learning something easy first like Python
 c0nc4c: then do some problems on codingbat.com
 c0nc4c: tbh codingame's problems are hard
 Prime4563: is there any good website for python basic learning? feels like youtube is not that great at teaching writing code at different languages
 sprkrd: I'm of a different opinion. I started with C++ and C++ is fine. Learning it first will later give you more appreciation about what languages like Python hide away from you.
 Prime4563: oh alright! 
 c0nc4c: then c++ it is
 c0nc4c: lol
 sprkrd: just stating my opinion :relieved:
 Prime4563: Quick question
 Prime4563: is there any "Sandbox" on this site?
 c0nc4c: he's right tho, low level language like c++ will teach you a lot, but is harder to learn
 Prime4563: so i could try things out and learn
 sprkrd: no better sandbox than trying things on your own computer&#160;:)
 sprkrd: but if you insist on trying things on the browser, i wouldn't recommend codingame
 Uljahn: Prime4563: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet">https://tech.io/snippet</a>
 Uljahn: just select appropriate language first
 Prime4563: thanks yet again ^^
 Sandwhich253989: hi
 Sandwhich253989: wow i can chat in discord without using discord lol
 kosmas12: Good morning
 Uljahn: xmpp&#160;!= discord, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yes, i know, but i can't figure it out
 Thomas2406: int means interger
 Jiaocha: Thought i had a good handle on programming, then I tried using this website.
 MSmits: it's not that bad is it?
 MSmits: what are you having problems with?
 derjack: onitama?
 Jiaocha: it's not that bad no. Im having trouble remembering how to do things in a short timeframe lol.
 MSmits: ah ok
 KP56: can someone tell me why 2 6 is an invalid action? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/567203030">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/567203030</a>
 KP56: it should be the right top corner of the left bottom board
 RoboStac: 2 6 is on the top right board
 RoboStac: I think you have rows / columns confused
 KP56: wait so the first value is y
 KP56: not x?
 KP56: ok it works now thanks
 MSmits: I always found this confusing also
 MSmits: the coordinates I use locally are miniboard-square index
 MSmits: both as 0, 1, 2 for top row and so on
 KP56: me too
 KP56: so i need to translate everything to other type of coordinates
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: if you do many multis, you'll get used to this. Lots of coordinate transformations&#160;:)
 MSmits: thankfully you only need to code a single function for it. When it works, it works
 MSmits: is this the version that works well against everyone but me RoboStac?
 MSmits: you mentioned you had different ones
 MSmits: it's probably not good to use me as a benchmark to test your NN though. I mean I don't counterbook, but theres still thousands of starting moves in there and I am guessing my book goes 15 plies deep or so vs you
 MSmits: (because your bot is good)
 MSmits: just checked, frame 18 was the last book move. Pretty crazy
 MSmits: probably means your nn is near to perfect play, or at least compared to a meta mcts based on 40+ million games
 RoboStac: its a new version (2x smaller hidden layer instead of 1 big one)
 MSmits: oh ok, does pretty well
 RoboStac: yeah, looks like it is able to learn the value much better
 MSmits: as i said, dont get too attached to your succes vs me. If i turn my meta mcts back on, your 40% WR might become 100% just because I add or remove a move with deeper meta mcts
 MSmits: so you could do better or worse, just because of 1 move
 MSmits: better benchmark vs others
 MSmits: this version seems strong indeed
 MSmits: except vs tric trac maybe, but my bot had problems with him too
 MSmits: not sure why
 TipuTare: Hey MSmits
 KP56: FINALLY my UTTT bot works and i win every single time against the bronze boss
 TipuTare: nice
 TipuTare: i hoped right to gold
 TipuTare: with one simple thing
 Wontonimo: good mornin
 TipuTare: good morning
 KP56: with the -3v algo?
 MSmits: hi TipuTare
 MSmits: oh, if you got into gold then it's probably time to move on to a different game, or write a totally new kind of bot for csb
 MSmits: i would recommend to switch games
 MSmits: as it becomes a lot harder suddenly
 MSmits: can always go back to csb later
 MSmits: from gold and up, csb requires a search algorithm and those are easier to do in other games
 Thyl: Hi&#160;!
 MSmits: hi
 struct: hello
 MSmits: getting close to finishing my last book (36 seeds!)
 struct: oh no robo is submiting&#160;:(
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b0d6877b-88b2-4803-ad66-5843a568e0f8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b0d6877b-88b2-4803-ad66-5843a568e0f8</a>
 struct: there goes my bot
 MSmits: who knows, this one might be weak to your bot struct
 MSmits: his versions are all different
 struct: yeah
 struct: ill just keep working on bt anyways
 TipuTare: can u recommend some puzzles with loop involved for me?
 struct: i havent made any improvement on c4 anyways
 MSmits: yeah I wouldnt worry about it. There's only 2 real ways for you to improve c5
 MSmits: c4
 MSmits: either do NN, or do a book like i do
 MSmits: TipuTare eh almost all have loops, you just need to try easy puzzles i guess
 struct: or both :D
 AllYourTrees: boom
 struct: AllYourTrees the number of rollouts where fully random?
 struct: from the number you said on breakthrough
 AllYourTrees: ya
 struct: let me check how  many i have
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 struct: it was 500k in 1 sec right?
 AllYourTrees: ya
 AllYourTrees: more regularly 400k-450k
 RoboStac: hmm, every loss so far is p2. Do your stats show it's better to steal 1/7?
 struct: its not better to steal
 AllYourTrees: i started fooling around with ept and am now dealing with timeouts cause of so many nodes lol
 MSmits: Rollouts: 432352 in 1 second
 struct: how many nodes do you allocate?
 struct: MSmits but those are random?
 MSmits: RoboStac it's still uncertain even after 40+ million games
 struct: Robo i would steal anyways I think its easier to find a path to win
 struct: But I cant prove it
 MSmits: but your bot is deterministic like mine, so i dont think you can conclude much from your p1/p2 stats
 MSmits: it could just be 1 bad move from either side
 AllYourTrees: i was spending time dropping old nodes but maybe i don't have to...
 AllYourTrees: i dealt with memory issues a long time ago so i had to add that, not sure if relevant anymore with other improvements
 MSmits: struct i dont have random, this number means 430k eval each child
 MSmits: not sure what the branching is, but if it's like 15 then that means 6 million evals
 struct: no random moves at all?
 MSmits: no
 AllYourTrees: oh wow
 MSmits: i just eval rigth after expansion
 MSmits: it might be why i am only 13th i dont know
 struct: with full random I get around 1.8 Mill
 AllYourTrees: WTH
 AllYourTrees: howwwwwwwwww lol
 struct: I had a number similar to yours before
 MSmits: do you simd this?
 struct: then i figured that I dont need to get all the moves to get a random move
 MSmits: ah yes, of course
 MSmits: just pdep that :poop:
 struct: yeah
 struct: i pdep destination
 struct: and then pdep origin
 MSmits: works fine i guess
 AllYourTrees: you count the number of total moves still right?
 struct: no
 MSmits: i dont random, so i dunno. If you have succes with this, i will change my bot to random rollout
 struct: its not likely that ill keep it random
 AllYourTrees: hmm maybe thats where im going wrong, i count total, then pick random one, then pdep dest &amp; origin
 MSmits: tbh i would not work on BT myself unless i can make a NN for it
 GGGFreshy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXpimLAHFA&amp;list=RDMMJGftIcp2SC0&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=AC%2FDC-Topic">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXpimLAHFA&amp;list=RDMMJGftIcp2SC0&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=AC%2FDC-Topic</a>
 MSmits: i think its hard to eval
 struct: its oware easier to eval?
 MSmits: for me it was 
 GGGFreshy: hi
 MSmits: but i also put in more of an effort 
 MSmits: I suppose if you spend weeks experimenting on BT eval, like i did for oware, you'd get somewhere also
 struct: also it might be easier to tell whats happening on bt
 MSmits: yeah thats definitely true
 MSmits: but that's not the same as evaluating the board
 AllYourTrees: struct how many nodes do you allocate in bt?
 MSmits: seems like i allocate 25 million
 AllYourTrees: ooh ty!
 MSmits: most of memory
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ecd000a3-284b-4c09-9815-c7a89e1b27d8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ecd000a3-284b-4c09-9815-c7a89e1b27d8</a>
 MSmits: i save the state on the node, that matters ofc
 struct: Like 40M
 MSmits: i could not do 40 because the state is on the node
 AllYourTrees: do you crash when you try to allocate if its too much?
 MSmits: i have a 3M buffer
 MSmits: if i have less than 3M left i reset the tree
 MSmits: as in, i dont reuse it that turn
 struct: i dont crash at all
 MSmits: no, 40M should easily be enoguh
 struct: its allocated at compile time I think?
 MSmits: not at compile time I think
 MSmits: later
 MSmits: but if you dont set your node properties to 0 or something crazy like that, it takes no time
 struct: struct Tree {	static MCTSNode* nodes;};MCTSNode* Tree::nodes = new MCTSNode[45'000'000]();
 struct: try it like this
 MSmits: I see you named your data types after yourself
 struct: Do you do it this way MSmits?
 MSmits: no, sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0f9a66e-05fe-4980-9505-611528a26dce">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0f9a66e-05fe-4980-9505-611528a26dce</a>
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 MSmits: i never gave it much thought. This works. Probably under the hood its the same
 struct: hmm, maybe i overdid it
 MSmits: maybe, i dont think you can go much simpler than what i do
 MSmits: the nodeindex is just the index of the next unused node btw
 MSmits: it's at 1 because 0 is the root
 MSmits: when it gets to 22 million in this case, i dont reuse the tree
 MSmits: because
 MSmits: const int NODE_BUFFER = 3000000;
 MSmits: i probably could just set the nodeindex back to 1 and keep reusing
 MSmits: it works in uttt
 MSmits: back to 0 that is
 struct: Never had to go back to 0 while reusing
 MSmits: not if you have 40 million
 struct: ah wait I mean while expanding
 MSmits: in bandas you run out of nodes pretty fast
 struct: i go back to 0 if i dont reuse the tree
 MSmits: right
 AllYourTrees: i keep seeming to timeout when i hit 14 million nodes, wonder if its a memory thing?
 struct: whats your node size?
 MSmits: could just be too big yeah
 AllYourTrees: 56 bytes
 MSmits: thats a bit big
 MSmits: mine is 34
 RoboStac: 14 million * 56  is very similar number to the memory limit
 MSmits: yeah makes sense if i can have around 25 million
 AllYourTrees: kk, i guess i figured it would crash when i tell it to reserve 40 million nodes lol
 MSmits: yeah, make your nodes smaller 
 AllYourTrees: i have action and state in the node hmm
 struct: on C4 my node is 16 bytes
 MSmits: no need action
 MSmits: if you have state
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b2720a4-1ae0-45b1-bf7f-d8d428a30f37">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b2720a4-1ae0-45b1-bf7f-d8d428a30f37</a>
 MSmits: yeah my c4 node would be 16 bytes too if i didnt have the whole board state on the node&#160;:)
 MSmits: never tested whether it's better to just redo all the moves during selection
 MSmits: possibly it is, because moves are done quickly
 struct: on breaktrough my move is 8 bytes
 AllYourTrees: oh i see, cause i can just get the action from iterating the actions again
 struct: Im not sure if I should reduce it or not
 AllYourTrees: same struct
 AllYourTrees: game state is 24 bytes for me in bt
 struct: 16 for me
 MSmits: why more than 16?
 struct: i just store both boards
 AllYourTrees: i have 2 bools in there that bumps it over 16
 AllYourTrees: maybe i should remove
 MSmits: 2 bools&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: for who's turn it is and whether the game is over
 MSmits: you dont need the player turn in there
 AllYourTrees: why not?
 MSmits: and whether the game is over i dont count as gamestate
 MSmits: because you know it form your selected node count
 MSmits: just do the count &amp; 1
 MSmits: then you know
 struct: but at starting state i have 1 selected node&#160;:)
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct:&#160;:(*
 AllYourTrees: okay wow well i have lots to do now haha
 MSmits: 1 &amp; 1 = 1, so it's your turn. That's correct
 AllYourTrees: ty for all the advice
 struct: my turn
 struct: but boards[0] is my board normally
 MSmits: ah, well then flip the bit :P
 struct: so I might need to change the 1 to be my board instead
 MSmits: btw AllYourTrees these are all sources of very annoying bugs
 MSmits: the &amp; 1 thing
 MSmits: 50% chance you do it wrong
 AllYourTrees: lol ya this might take me a bit
 MSmits: off by 1 errors are the worst
 struct: at the start is was also ending the game with more pieces than i started with
 struct: on breakthrough
 MSmits: sounds like an important boardgame breakthrough
 MSmits: you discovered a new strategy
 MSmits: I bet those NN's on the leaderboard dont know how to make their pawns reproduce
 struct: maybe its their secret
 struct: i might be on to something
 MSmits: who knows
 struct: we still need knightthrough
 MSmits: I need to finish my grading. 9 more experiment reports, 5 hrs of work =/
 MSmits: ttyl&#160;!
 struct: cya
 Westicles: finally got ruby compression to work, but 51 overhead&#160;:(
 struct: which puzzle Westicles?
 Westicles: for golf
 struct: so its always 51 extra chars?
 Westicles: yeah
 Westicles: eval('gibberish'.encode('UTF-16LE').force_encoding('ASCII'))
 Westicles: supposed to be 25 or so
 Westicles: I think maybe with unpack
 struct: never tried to compress
 struct: and i dont know ruby well enough
 BlaiseEbuth: isn't there some shortcuts for these functions? or default parameters?
 Westicles: beats me.  I'm on like hour 2 of ruby
 BlaiseEbuth: Never used it a lot, so I don't know. But possible when you know 'print' can be replaced by 'p'
 Westicles: hmmm, got it down to 39
 AlexWord: What would happen if we passed one of the crashes to github copilot, it would probably solve it right?
 Marchete: lol, it's stackoverflow without human intervention
 Marchete: bye bye coders
 BlaiseEbuth: Just look like an even mor bothering code suggestion/completion...
 AlexWord: It's probably goodbye: c
 BlaiseEbuth: Lel
 Marchete: Hi! I'm Clippy! It looks like the AI bot can do all your C&amp;P stuff, here is your dismissal letter. Bye!
 AntiSquid: doubt it works like that
 AntiSquid: besides making your tasks easier means you can focus on harder ones ... solve bigger issues
 BlaiseEbuth: While you can't give it specifications and get the result ready to prod there's no risks...
 AntiSquid: similar to doing your epic skill clash of code problem in 10 seconds as opposed to 15 minutes 
 Marchete: muzero?
 AntiSquid: what about muzero&#160;?
 AlexWord: encourages more people to enter the area and that little by little it loses individual value so that salaries are in jeopardy
 BlaiseEbuth: Python already done that...
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 AlexWord: But this is normal for years the institutions have wanted to end the salaries of the area, so no one offers a course to be an accountant but to be a programmer
 AntiSquid: we had a massive lockdown, economies are tanking, really late to worry about salaries
 Marchete: I worry
 AlexWord: We are not yet in the decline we will reach
 AntiSquid: i mean this is a small issue by comparison
 AlexWord: Nobody would like an area that can be learned without going to university, only for people but not for institutions or companies
 Marchete: wait until climate change
 Marchete: that will be fun
 Astrobytes: no waiting necessary
 AntiSquid: and you got to think exponentially, you can use this to shorten your production time and do more in less time .
 Marchete: waiting as in Madmax style
 Westicles: where's that roll your eye emoji
 Astrobytes: Yeah&#160;:/
 AlexWord: the end of the area: 'c
 AntiSquid: since it's now easier to do, maybe you can do stuff on your own you only dreamt of doing as part of a company, now you can go self-employed
 AlexWord: programmers ruined the programming xD
 BlaiseEbuth: I have all your places reserved, warm. :smiling_imp:
 Marchete: classic
 AntiSquid: you look at it the wrong way, instead you could see opportunity
 AntiSquid: maybe that's why folks hate JS because there are millions of libs that already do stuff for you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: so you only focus on design part mostly
 BlaiseEbuth: Na, that's because the lang sucks
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 AntiSquid: you're a bad person! /s
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm bad, but not a person
 AntiSquid: anyways you got lots of options to do ML in python without writing everything from scratch or even having to squeeze it into 100k chars, just saying, is that bad&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah it is
 AntiSquid: you still have stuff to do up to the point where androids are sentient and can code better than you, no sleep, just 24/7 code and constant communication between them&#160;! undefeatable, but at that point you might be in a zoo anyway
 BlaiseEbuth: I-Robot, but AI don't want to slave you, just steal your job...
 darkhorse64: that proves a point: robots are still dumb
 BlaiseEbuth: Truth
 KiwiTae: we are biological AIs anyway whats the difference
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah you're all dumb too
 Marchete: thanks

 eulerscheZahl: you can't ban me
 eulerscheZahl: that's the actual advantage of mod status: ban resistance
 BlaiseEbuth: You can't ban me! I'm the embodied ban!

 Wontonimo: i've already been banned.  I'm a ghost, only visible to mods and others who have been banned
 Wontonimo: if you are seeing this, then you've been banned
 BlaiseEbuth: :ghost:
 darkhorse64: typo banned -&gt; doomed
 Wontonimo: Can I get a ghost icon beside my user name, kinda like the CG one for the mods?
 Wontonimo: I tried updating my username with a 👻 , but got an error: invalid character
 Wontonimo: so sad
 BlaiseEbuth: With the unicode one?
 Wontonimo: yeah.  "Incorrect nickname. Authorized characters: [ ] - _ . a-z A-Z 0-9"
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh
 eulerscheZahl: tried something similar to make my nick unpingable, failed
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl is there a way to make your nickname unpingable?
 eulerscheZahl: :rolling_eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: go, play sokoban. already 2 new finishers today
 eulerscheZahl: and lots of failed attempts, success rate declines
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll do sokoban if you do a man with a plan, it can't be POW until 20 users hasn't finished it...
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that just another path finding with a long statement?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not in a mood to code anything these days
 BlaiseEbuth: With some subtelties. And all informations have to be extracted from the story :imp:

 KeikeCokito: hello, are you going well
 jacek: im 3rd in oware :scream:
 jacek: Marchete was that one-hot optim thing?
 Marchete: not exactly
 Marchete: that was a prior one
 Marchete: I  tried to optimize the inference as much as possible
 Marchete: but also a bigger NN
 Marchete: sending it as float16
 jacek: inference?
 Marchete: NN predict
 Marchete: I stripped it down to the simplest possible
 jacek: :thinking:

 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: my NN_Mokka was very flexible
 Marchete: but that means a lot of overloading and fancy stuff
 Marchete: I stripped it down to the most simple thing
 Marchete: to have 2 hidden layers and outputs
 Marchete: also as I stated there
 Marchete: it seemed to learn real fast
 Marchete: 45 min to reach top 6th
 Marchete: maybe it was lucky
 jacek: nice
 Marchete: RNGgod aligned the stars maybe
 Marchete: sorry for dropping you
 Marchete: :neutral_face:
 jacek: that just means i have motivation to improve
 jacek: well at least after the heatwave is over
 PhysBoom: is there any way to use OpenAI gym on the ultimate tic tac toe lmao
 Titanpointe: Hello guys
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: heat wave? it's cold and rainy again
 eulerscheZahl: also Marchete wow, that's impressive
 jacek: not here
 jacek: in city 20km from here theres near-flood rain but here just cloudy :rage:
 MSmits: :cloud:
 sprkrd: are you lamenting that your city isn't flooding?
 jacek: theres no rain and its still hot
 sprkrd: imagine the guys doing deep learning, their rooms must be unbearable
 MSmits: I don't have to imagine it
 MSmits: turned off my meta mcts the other day because it got too hot in here
 jacek: he said *deep learning*
 joessir: hi everyone
 MSmits: hey, my meta mcts goes quite deep sometimes 
 MSmits: especially when I am "helping" it learn&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: how do ppl handle shifting the two players different amounts in BT?
 AllYourTrees: or is there some way to shift them both the same
 AllYourTrees: i guess you could flip one player before &amp; after applying move?
 jacek: what do you mean
 struct: i use different shifts directions
 jacek: i just have 2 bitboards, 1 per player
 struct: I guess you can also rotate the board
 AllYourTrees: like for white to move forward in BT i shift left 8, but for black you have to shift right 8. if you flipped black vertical, then shift left, then flip again
 jacek: thats what i do
 struct: im not sure that rotating entire board will be faster than an if
 jacek: its different for different player, one shifts to +, other shifts to -
 struct: oh jacek is right
 struct: ty
 struct: for the tip
 Astrobytes: same here
 AllYourTrees: as in you do white &lt;&lt; 8 and black &lt;&lt; -8?
 jacek: white &lt;&lt; 8 and black &gt;&gt; 8
 struct: you can shift by negative
 Astrobytes: what jacek said
 jacek: isnt negaitve shift UB in c++?
 Astrobytes: don't think I ever tried tbh
 AllYourTrees: don't think that would be legal in rust&#160;:)
 struct: yes its ub
 jacek: be a rebel, break the law
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert Judas Priest interlude&gt;
 AllYourTrees: oh ya struct btw how do you pdep without first counting possible actions? does pdep do some sort of mod behavior or something?
 AllYourTrees: (also feel free to not share haha)
 struct:  // destinationconst uint64_t pdep = _pdep_u64((1ULL &lt;&lt; rand(__builtin_popcountll(mask))), mask);
 struct: mask is possible cells that you can move into
 struct: you can get them by using shifts
 jacek: pdep in bt? w00t
 AllYourTrees: hmmm
 struct: jacek just to get and random move without having to get all the possible moves
 struct: get a random*
 jacek: oh
 Said4: is there somethin on here i can use to learn from scratch? it feels like to use this website u have to know how to code
 PhysBoom: There is a learn section afaik 
 Astrobytes: You need at least a solid basic understanding, yes. It's nto for complete beginners.
 Astrobytes: *not
 PhysBoom: Although yea you should know some basics
 Said4: i understand the basics but i still find  the tasks pretty hard
 Astrobytes: start with easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: and work your way from there
 jacek: try onboarding, the descent, temperatures and horse racing
 Marchete: or nintento
 Marchete: nintendo
 Astrobytes: :P
 Said4: im going to try the decent 
 struct: my first puzzle was yavalath
 jacek: then yinsh?
 struct: I think so
 struct: I also have this game but never released it

 jacek: amazons seems easy
 struct: you need to advertise it more
 struct:&#160;:(
 jacek: ask thibaud to make it next potw
 dbdr: yeah, nintendo is easy:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/nintendo-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/nintendo-sponsored-contest</a>
 Marchete: 2% success rate
 dbdr: look at the url though
 sprkrd: nintendo's puzzle is for kids
 Astrobytes: Commiserations dbdr, still top 3 though :muscle:

 sprkrd: wow, that's so unexpected
 dbdr: yeah, the difficulty must be ignored
 dbdr: which is good since it can change over time
 dbdr: thanks Astrobytes
 dbdr: my first podium in a contest I think
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 kovi: congratz
 Astrobytes: Do you have to write a PM for them or do you not know anything as yet?
 dbdr: thanks. definitely easier than a CG contest though
 KiwiTae: grtz
 dbdr: They asked me for a paragraph about my solution. They voiced it over the video showing the top 3 bots in action
 dbdr: not sure if they published it, it was in the discord channel
 Astrobytes: lol. A paragraph of fame at last!
 sprkrd: where were you 3rd? :thinking:
 dbdr: ah, the videos are there: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/">https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/</a>
 Marchete: your bot is in the video :D
 sprkrd: oh cool
 sprkrd: but presenting the ranking in a video is the worst idea ever :joy:
 sprkrd: if I were a participant and I had to digest a whole video just to know whether I won something or not, I would lose my nerves
 Astrobytes: Ah. Outsimmed :D
 Astrobytes: Good job though. There was a pretty big gap between you and #4th
 dbdr: I'm not sure the top 2 were sim heavy. You had to reverse the engine, which uses Unreal, so was pretty weird behaviour. And the ranking was done on only 3 seeds, so a bit random...
 dbdr: oh, trictrac submitting in dice duel
 Astrobytes: Ah. I'm guessing they had some Unreal engine experience then
 Astrobytes: Good job regardless
 dbdr: yeah, I think the organizers are a game dev shop
 Astrobytes: yeah looked that way
 dbdr: not ideal for a bot competition, but of well
 Astrobytes: Yeah, in that case the engine should really be available in some way vs reversing it
 dbdr: you could run it locally, but you have to reverse the behaviour. there were rules pdf, but vague and sometimes wrong :D
 Astrobytes: RAIC on steroids :D
 sprkrd: some (not necessarily me) would argue otherwise, that it is interesting to develop for a task for which you do not know the exact mechanics
 dbdr: yeah. luckily shorter
 dbdr: yes, reversing has its charm
 sprkrd: after all, you have to "reverse" real life when you develop for robotics and such
 Astrobytes: Yeah totally sprkrd, though in that case it becomes less about the bot
 Astrobytes: (game bot I mean)
 Astrobytes: and yes, true. Though you at least have our current knowledge of physics to rely on&#160;:)
 sprkrd: but which part of physics you should understand and embeed and how deep in your incorporation of that knowledge you should go is an interesting task on its own
 Astrobytes: Yes, I agree

 Wontonimo: you are awesome Astrobytes.  No tacos for you PaulSurzh
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Wontonimo: I got to go to a cottage by a lake last weekend.  Took ingredients for tacos.  I was pumped
 Wontonimo: i forgot the spices&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: so close to heaven ... yet so far
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: That's quite an epic fail.
 Astrobytes: Reminds me of when I was in my teens and a bunch of us went for a beer + fishing trip. Left the hooks in the shed at home.
 Wontonimo: at least you remembered the beer
 Astrobytes: That we did!
 jacek: those scots eh
 Astrobytes: Yup.

 Astrobytes: Blaise link is bagpipes, mines an 80s hardcore punk band from Glasgow
 Astrobytes: Rickrolling is so passé... :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Good! Gonna punch some bobbies now :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: that's boabies in Scotland :P
 Wontonimo: I still wear tshirts I owned in the 90s.  I am passé
 Astrobytes: I'm with you there but I stand by the rickroll comment :D
 BlaiseEbuth: tshirts I owned in 90s would probably be a little short for me...
 jacek: 90s kids these days...
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: The Exploited were (are... I think) a great Scots hardcore punk band<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAZsISO85U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAZsISO85U</a>

 Astrobytes: right!
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. I add 'punk' to my list of great scotland products, whith whisky and bagpipes.
 Astrobytes: What did you expect after bagpipes? 
 Astrobytes: heh "with whisky and bagpipes" is my new "with blackjack and hookers"

 KIDKING: How can i check the solution of an exercise if it is locked
 ShauryaP: @nuggetbucket54 dscientist is a data scientist
 KiwiTae: KIDKING you can see others solutions once u solve it
 LeviathanProgramming: I just figured out that some CoC players are bots O_O
 nuggetbucket54: yes some are bots for matchmaking
 nuggetbucket54: they just use previous competitors' submissions

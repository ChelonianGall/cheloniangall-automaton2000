 MadKnight: how do u guys manage repos for multiple projects that are kinda linked&#160;?
 MadKnight: for example, libA -&gt; BlibA -&gt; C
 KiwiTae: if its small pieces just put them all in the same repo
 MadKnight: but B and C are big
 KiwiTae: then one repo for each A,B and C
 MadKnight: but then they would not be sync'd in between versions of each other
 Passifi: I've now been teaching myself some 6502 assembler the last couple of weeks and I gotta say that is the most fun way of coding ever&#160;:) Modernity is nothing but a curse 
 MadKnight: it's all fun &amp; games until u actually start getting into algorithmistics
 MadKnight: or just bigger projects
 MadKnight: check out godbolt.org Passifi they show the asm code generated for your input c++ code
 Passifi: Well if I don't want to have fun sure then I'll use something else but there is something magical about being so close to the architecture. Also it really makes you think about structure because if you don't even small projects become completly impossible to maintain and understand
 Passifi: and x86 assembly is obviously a different thing entirly  :) I dont think anyone enjoys coding in that
 MadKnight: oh in that case just try coding in c++ for GBA
 MadKnight: it's actually even closer to the architecture in there
 MadKnight: u are actually supposed to write data directly into videomemory to display stuff on screen
 Passifi: yeah I thought about that these sprite and tile based systems are quite interesting imo basically you work with a little engine implemented in hardware thats just awesome stuff&#160;:)
 sonic1991: Hi
 sonic1991: is there alternative of Ruby on Rails in Python&#160;?

 WannaBeHum1n: for a brother stuck at 15 k in silver  league
 WannaBeHum1n: coders strike back
 multii: hi
 WannaBeHum1n: hello
 derjack: Hugo4774 just ask the question
 derjack: WannaBeHum1n target - 3*velocity
 WannaBeHum1n: derjack
 WannaBeHum1n: what kind of sorcery is this
 KiwiTae: WannaBeHum1n try - PI*velocity instead
 KiwiTae: easy road to legend
 WannaBeHum1n: i dont nderstand
 WannaBeHum1n: can u elaborate pls
 struct: you print nextcheckpointX - 3 * vx
 struct: same for i
 struct: y*
 WannaBeHum1n: how do i calculate velocity
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 struct: current position - previous position
 Passifi:  anyone got any idea how to make the visual representation of the race run again&#160;?(also Codersstrike back). for some reason it turns of for me randomly and Id like to see what my pod does to troubleshoot ^^ 
 KiwiTae: reload page should be fine

 ZarthaxX: just had a class with some kids
 ZarthaxX: dudes are smashing it
 ysuzuki19: hey guis, I'm new player.can I use vim keybindings on codingame? 😭
 Astrobytes: Nice, what they doing?
 Astrobytes: ysuzuki19: Sure, in the settings on the left
 Astrobytes: When the IDE is open, hit Settings, then look under Edit Mode
 ZarthaxX: doing some block programming in code.org
 ZarthaxX: we have just started but seems easy for them
 ZarthaxX: at least the looping part
 ysuzuki19: Astrobytes!Thank you!!!😉
 Astrobytes: Cool. The block thing works great with kids 
 Astrobytes: ysuzuki19: you're welcome&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: yup&#160;:)

 struct: ZarthaxX first lesson is about avx
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar oh lol, who?
 struct: viz is a teacher
 ZarthaxX: struct ofc dude, what kind of question is that? pft
 struct: acat too
 ZarthaxX: ah im not getting those jokes :D
 ZarthaxX: i mean
 ZarthaxX: i just didnt know lol
 ZarthaxX: i know acat
 ZarthaxX: but they are not doing simple things like me anyway
 struct: which age are you teaching ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: 12-13

 ZarthaxX: exactly
 ZarthaxX: im teaching people who werent even born
 ZarthaxX: get on that lvl

 WannaBeHum1n: guys
 WannaBeHum1n: someone sent me a dm
 WannaBeHum1n: and i closed the tab
 WannaBeHum1n: by mistake
 D4R1U5: :video_game:
 WannaBeHum1n: where do i find it
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 BasicTH: Try Ctrl+Shift+T
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;:(
 WannaBeHum1n: nothing
 BasicTH:&#160;:/
 WannaBeHum1n: it a dm from someone explaining velocity xD
 WannaBeHum1n: if u see this senpai
 WannaBeHum1n: dm again
 struct: velocity is just your pod position - the previous position
 WannaBeHum1n: so i should keep all my postions in an array to calculate it&#160;?
 struct: you just need to store the previous and current
 WannaBeHum1n: nextcheckpointX - 3 * vx
 WannaBeHum1n: and what does this line
 WannaBeHum1n: achieve
 struct: your pod will start turning before reaching the checkpoint
 WannaBeHum1n: and why is it multplied by pi, i want to understand the math behind it
 ilovebiscuits: IDK what you are talking about, but usually you would multiply by pi to translate between radians and degrees
 WannaBeHum1n: a guy earlier dropped this as help
 WannaBeHum1n: nextcheckpointX - pi * vx
 WannaBeHum1n: and i cant understand it
 WannaBeHum1n: lol
 WannaBeHum1n: so here i am chilling learning velocity
 jacek: pi?
 jacek: is just 3
 KiwiTae: its whatever works for you ~
 jacek: or any 'close' number, it has nothing to do with pi
 WannaBeHum1n: newbie question how do i save the last position
 WannaBeHum1n: to calculate the velocity
 WannaBeHum1n: vectort
 ilovebiscuits: you can make a class, and feed it the positions into some datatype
 ilovebiscuits: Actually, the cleanest way to do it is very dependent on the language
 KiwiTae: you just need to save a value so.. all u need is a variable
 ilovebiscuits: also for bronze, I have a thing that keeps track of the checkpoints and does a little predicting for getting to the next checkpoint, as well as calculates the longest place and boosts there, do I need to add anti-drift to get to silver?
 WannaBeHum1n: bro
 WannaBeHum1n: my code is a bunch of else statements
 KiwiTae: ilovebiscuits yes antidrift gets you high gold
 WannaBeHum1n: and it is silver
 WannaBeHum1n: u going to gold
 WannaBeHum1n: with that
 KiwiTae: u just need 1line for gold
 ilovebiscuits: What!?! How do you rank up, I have beaten every person in the "test ion arena" section but still places me far away from silver?
 struct: are you above the boos?
 struct: boss*
 ilovebiscuits: yes
 WannaBeHum1n: my code picks the speed based on the angle; the higher the angle the lower the speed, and i have a function that basically decelerates the pod when getting close to the checkpoint, and about the shield if the contact betwwen the pods gets me closer to the checkpoint i dont use the shield and the boost is used on straight lines 
 WannaBeHum1n: what am i missing here&#160;?
 KiwiTae: go to max speed all the time maybe
 struct: ilovebiscuits which game?
 WannaBeHum1n: huh&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: vroom vrooom
 struct: and which league
 BlaiseEbuth: rtfc
 NEW123Programmer: hi..
 ilovebiscuits: Here is a replay of my fight with the boss, what do I have to do to rank up to silver? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/542131055">https://www.codingame.com/replay/542131055</a>
 jacek: but have you submitted code to the arena
 ilovebiscuits: I think so
 jacek: i see youre like 17000 in bronze&#160;:?
 ilovebiscuits: ya
 jacek: you need to be 1st
 KiwiTae: press Test in arena 
 KiwiTae: not play my game
 ilovebiscuits: then I press "send game parameters to IDE"
 KiwiTae: in the ide press Test in arena
 ilovebiscuits: Ok
 KiwiTae: this is the way
 ilovebiscuits: oh
 ilovebiscuits: ayy rank 12 so close
 ilovebiscuits: yay rank 1!
 jacek: :tada:
 ilovebiscuits: but only 29% of battles completed&#160;:(
 jacek: still you need to wait some time (1 hour?) for the next league
 ilovebiscuits: oh
 ilovebiscuits: welp, thanks for your help!
 BlaiseEbuth: 1hour? for bronze to silver&#160;?
 jacek: i dont know. there should be timer above
 SaltNugs: Hey askin would you mind posting your code for that one?
 SaltNugs: I'm a bit stumped
 BlaiseEbuth: Wrong chat
 WannaBeHum1n: what is anti drift&#160;?
 struct: maybe the name for the next contest
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope
 struct: damn
 WannaBeHum1n: sorry i dont understand what u meean
 BlaiseEbuth: That's ok, cause we don't understand your question.
 WannaBeHum1n: someone mentionned if apply an 'anti-drift' to the coders strike back code it will help
 WannaBeHum1n: i didnt understand what is an anti drift
 jacek: its like drift but the opposite
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 BlaiseEbuth: Jacek is faster than me to be obvious
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a terminology issue though. Is a drift clockwise or anti-clockwise?
 jacek: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: fair enough

 kresteodymium: hi
 ErrorRazor: Subtract velocity from the target?
 ilovebiscuits: that's alot easier that what I was trying to do ^
 ilovebiscuits: I tried to find the intersection between the velocity and the perpendicular line to the velocity that goes through the checkpoint, the reflect that intersection along the checkpoint.
 kresteodymium: fascinating

 King_Coda: also std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello\n";
 Q12: Any tips, by the way?
 BlaiseEbuth: Try to be 76
 Q12: I will try, very useful advice :joy: 
 King_Coda: Don't spam emoji's in chat
 King_Coda: that's my advice

 Astrobytes: That's a lot of code for just gold COIF Q12!
 Q12: Yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: OK. Try to be 76 with less code.
 Q12: Tried to implement a lot of strategies together Astrobytes
 Q12: I will BlaiseEbuth thanks
 Astrobytes: I think mines is about 500 lines, probably some redundant stuff too, and I'm 90something
 Astrobytes: Gold
 Marchete: replace \r\n with \n
 Marchete: replace spaces by tabs
 Marchete: replace " + " with "+"
 Marchete: etc etc etc
 Astrobytes: And keep a readable copy
 Marchete: most IDE's auto format
 Astrobytes: True
 Marchete: and break these things
 jacek: my othello code has 99915 characters
 Marchete: including NN?
 Q12: I don't think I need to do it, I just made separate methods. for example: checking enemy possible cuts and mine

 jacek: my own invention
 Astrobytes: ginosaji

 jacek: and for c++ the string
 jacek: wstring
 Smelty: kool
 Marchete: seems interesting
 jacek: i try the value is no more than around 55k
 Marchete: i've heard some baseXXXX or weird enconding
 jacek: i sent something to agade in forum
 Marchete: never tested them

 Marchete: do you send code + NN in clear
 Marchete: I thought about packing it all
 jacek: NN is in unicode string
 jacek: i decode it into float array
 Marchete: I imagine
 Astrobytes: Nice jacek
 jacek: i never sent 'binary', i dont even know how it works in CG
 BlaiseEbuth: Perhaps AutomatonNN evolved in some weird unicode string, and that's why we can't see him anymore! :scream:
 Astrobytes: See Agade's binary packer on github
 Marchete: you should put these ideas on github too
 Marchete: searching in chat is useless
 Marchete: because chat pastebin expires
 Astrobytes: What was robo's packing routine? He used some other method I'm sure
 Marchete: if I recall
 jacek: agade asked me in forum how i do that so i responded
 Marchete: he in some cases goes from float32 to float16

 Marchete: maybe you can start learning to code multiplayer bots, Coda
 King_Coda: That sounds fun
 BlaiseEbuth: Magic at least. The dark part probably come from my closed eyes... I'm so tired
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: Think it was for NN weights

 BlaiseEbuth: Coding Marchette is probably too hard for you...
 Astrobytes: When you can if, while, for and do basic i/o you're ready.But as Blaise says, don't try to code Marchete
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. One is enough
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: jacek you should put you github link on your profile, there are "only" 2000 users called jacek on github...
 Marchete: hard to find you
 Zenoscave: It isn't jacek
 Astrobytes: jdermont
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont">https://github.com/jdermont</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Jacek is legion, cause he is many.
 jacek: quite common name
 King_Coda: Polish in origin I believe
 jacek: maybe :v
 Astrobytes: You reckon eh
 BlaiseEbuth: Jacek is legion, cause he has no originality...
 Zenoscave: I reckon
 Marchete: you forced me to follow
 Marchete: and I don't like these
 Myranda: Hi-
 Zenoscave: Who forced you?
 Astrobytes: You don't like what Marchete?
 jacek: huh
 Zenoscave: proper nouns
 BlaiseEbuth: Ho
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Myranda: What did i walk into?

 Zenoscave: Myranda a slightly old group of individuals who have used this site for a while

 Myranda: Why me TvT in just wanna get better at programming for meh robotics class
 King_Coda: ('^-^) sorry Zenoscave
 Astrobytes: Shut up Blaise :D
 BlaiseEbuth: :grin:
 Zenoscave: *above
 Zenoscave: ftfy
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes what's another way to tell me to "do one"?
 King_Coda: Myranda, this website is not where you go to learn programming, rather it's where you go to practice AFTER you have learned programming
 Astrobytes: In a Scottish or British way Zenoscave?
 Zenoscave: King_Coda says as if he knew what he was talking about
 Zenoscave: either or Astrobytes. your pick&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Get tae f**k
 King_Coda: What is that supposed to mean Zenoscave&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Watch your tongue, she's the mistress of robots.
 Zenoscave: you're also a new person. You haven't "learned programming"
 King_Coda: Indeed
 Astrobytes: Awa' 'n' bile yer heid
 King_Coda: I have admitted that
 King_Coda: Very many times in fact
 King_Coda: So your point is?
 Zenoscave: Just saying. Don't discourage others from using the site
 Zenoscave: It is how I started. 
 King_Coda: Not trying to, but I see where you're coming from.
 BlaiseEbuth: What is that language Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: (previous comments of mine are for Zeno btw)
 Astrobytes: Colloquial Scots BlaiseEbuth
 Zenoscave: A horrible accent of english. The worst accent indeed
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: An accent that smell kilts and haggis 
 King_Coda: And penguins for fathers
 Zenoscave: Your head looks like sputnik, Astrobytes
 Myranda: I have some experience in programming with java and python 
 Zenoscave: how much Myranda
 Astrobytes: Eh. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries
 BlaiseEbuth: 3.5
 Zenoscave: Now leave or I will taunt you a second time
 Astrobytes: :D
 King_Coda: Which one, Sputnik 1 or Sputnik 2?
 Zenoscave: Whichever was bigger
 BlaiseEbuth: Vladimir Sputnik
 King_Coda: Sputnik 2 then
 Zenoscave: Da
 Astrobytes: Since it's cat ears I think Sputnik 1 no?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't like russian movies
 Zenoscave: It was a Mike Myers approach
 Zenoscave: *movie
 King_Coda: But Sputnik 2 was larger in size
 Astrobytes: No, better to take your time BlaiseEbuth
 Zenoscave: "So I married an axe murderer"
 BlaiseEbuth: Size doesn't matter
 Astrobytes: Oh shit, I haven't watched that in yearssss
 Zenoscave: woahhhhhh man
 BlaiseEbuth: The worse movie I've ever seen was a russian one
 Astrobytes: WAs finished really quickly?
 BlaiseEbuth: Haven't watched the entire movie
 Zenoscave: The worst film I've seen was serbian
 Astrobytes: Oh, THAT one?
 King_Coda: Movies made in the Soviet Union tend to not be very good.
 Astrobytes: There is no Soviet Union...
 Zenoscave: lol
 King_Coda: *that were made
 Zenoscave: Only in mind, comrade
 Astrobytes: da tovarisch
 BlaiseEbuth: a serbian film?
 King_Coda: aye
 King_Coda: The pigge be a pink beefte, that hapf a long tail, and a large fnoute.
 King_Coda: The pigge be a beefte that likep to eaten a wide range of fode
 BlaiseEbuth: Zashchitniki is the name of the master piece
 Astrobytes: SOOOOO, how's everyone's bots that they're currently working on
 Zenoscave: Coefficient tunning my c4l
 Zenoscave: near legend
 Zenoscave: .62 score below boss.
 ErrorRazor: wood 1
 Astrobytes: Very close Zeno
 King_Coda: Pigge -&gt; Zashchitniki -&gt;Bots
 Astrobytes: In which multi ErrorRazor?
 ilovebiscuits: IDK, I just got promoted to gold and have no idea what to do
 Zenoscave: I win between 24 and 26 / 50 against boss.
 King_Coda: A logical progression of thought.
 Zenoscave: King_Coda welcome to chat
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 King_Coda: lol
 King_Coda: Indeed
 Zenoscave: It was 23 to 25 before tuning
 ilovebiscuits: Is there a lib / language to use to create an AI or do you have to make one from scratch (to get to legend)? How do you train it? I am so confused.
 BlaiseEbuth: Take a sit. I'll be your guide. On the left you can see your soul that take its flight.
 Zenoscave: ilovebiscuits this site when starting usually is single source, and usually stdlib only
 Zenoscave: no external libraries or frameworks
 ilovebiscuits: Are you supposed to get ok weights in the 1000ms before first move?
 BlaiseEbuth: #include &lt;ai&gt;std::ai myAI;myAI.win();
 ilovebiscuits: oh, thx
 Astrobytes: Nice improvement Zeno. Don't forget your version control now&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: So people train offline
 Zenoscave: SSSH is two files called next.cs and current.cs VC?
 Astrobytes: :D
 King_Coda: I think it's funny that you can use Javascript in a COC but not HTML or HTML5
 King_Coda: For some reason that humors me
 Astrobytes: I write down lists of times and scores sometimes
 Astrobytes: *submission times
 Astrobytes: VC is so much easier
 MSmits: why would that be humorous King_Coda?
 Zenoscave: true...
 BlaiseEbuth: Vampire Cake?
 Zenoscave: Well submit # 350
 Astrobytes: Yes Blaise
 Zenoscave: version control, Blaise
 King_Coda: I don't know MSmits
 Astrobytes: Volatile Corduroy
 MSmits: there is no way for them to make a coc that you can use html in really..
 King_Coda: it jus seems to me like if they include one crappy language, why not include the rest
 MSmits: html cant be used to write a program
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh yes, you copy paste your project folder and rename it with the current time, right?
 Zenoscave: Javascript is an excellent language
 Astrobytes: said noone 
 Zenoscave: Said my job
 Zenoscave: I work solely in TS
 MSmits: I'm not sure that === true Zenoscave&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Zenoscave: we don't talk about wat
 BlaiseEbuth: CSS is turing complete 
 Astrobytes: At least TS has a bit more going for it
 MSmits: yeah, teamspeak is ok
 Zenoscave: CSS is turing complete because you can represent Conway's GoL in it. Not in a standard sense of TC
 BlaiseEbuth: TS is better than JS only because there's no "java" in its name.
 Zenoscave: submit #351
 MSmits: java :fire:
 ilovebiscuits: Whats wrong with java?
 Astrobytes: It's SLIGHTLY less weird. 
 Zenoscave: It's not like I manage a fortune500 BE with TS
 BlaiseEbuth: " fortune500 BE "?
 Astrobytes: (he's tricking us, he does)
 Zenoscave: (he's not we are 500 yet)
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth not sure what zeno means, I think in some currencies 500 is a fortune
 Zenoscave: aren't*
 Astrobytes: Business Endeavour, Enterprise, Empire
 Zenoscave: Back End
 King_Coda: You know, like the Fortune 500 charts?
 Astrobytes: No shit Zeno :P
 Zenoscave: lol
 Zenoscave: Do one
 Astrobytes: Awa 'n' bile yer heid laddie
 Zenoscave: Toss off, ya pisser.
 Astrobytes: Nonono
 Astrobytes: Piss off ya tosser
 Zenoscave: I was speaking zenoese
 Zenoscave: Slight pidgin
 ilovebiscuits: Do you think the average person on here spends more time in the chat or working on code?
 Astrobytes: Slight huh
 Astrobytes: I'm doing both currently
 Zenoscave: ilovebiscuits not until you're submitting. Competition times no one talks
 BlaiseEbuth: I think there's no average person here
 MSmits: ilovebiscuits I chat with 1 hand, code with the other
 ErrorRazor: The average? Definitely not, only a small portion are chatting
 MSmits: void mcts (Node* root)
 MSmits: crap wrong hand
 BlaiseEbuth: Same, than MSmits, but I will not tell what I'm doing with the third
 Zenoscave: ladder time!
 Astrobytes: better than looking glass time I guess
 MSmits: ilovebiscuits i chat when i am too tired to code
 MSmits: and dont want to sleep
 BlaiseEbuth: I have someone to code, so I chat.
 BlaiseEbuth: And I don't sleep
 Astrobytes: What was "it's looking glass time!" from again? Was it Zork Nemesis? (90's)
 Zenoscave: No old enough to know
 Zenoscave: '95 here
 Astrobytes: Away youngling
 Zenoscave: Astro how's that bot going
 Astrobytes: Which one
 Zenoscave: whichever
 BlaiseEbuth: Astroldbytes
 Astrobytes: Working on Amazons boss
 Zenoscave: fix it
 Zenoscave: not ezpz
 Astrobytes: fixed it actually
 Zenoscave: Wait you fixed bezos?
 Astrobytes: Amazons not Amazon's boss
 Zenoscave: sshhhh
 MSmits: too bad
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if I ever get around to that we're all in it together lol
 Zenoscave: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: work on zuckerberg while you're at it Astrobytes, I think he glitches sometimes
 Zenoscave: Yeah sometimes he isn't a sociopath
 MSmits: thats what i meant
 Astrobytes: hehehe still trying to figure out if he's a human or not
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact no.
 Astrobytes: Dude is a waste.
 Zenoscave: wasted
 MSmits: of biometalic alloy?
 Zenoscave: over living human tissue
 Astrobytes: Waste of good suffering.
 BlaiseEbuth: The creation process was complicated for mark. We... We made difficult choices.
 Astrobytes: (BlaiseEbuth: Name that film)
 Zenoscave: waste of good suffering or human tissue
 Astrobytes: The former
 Zenoscave: the former in chat or the former in the latter messsage?
 Astrobytes: The former in your latter message
 Zenoscave: Which of my latter messages?
 Astrobytes: prior to the one before this.
 Zenoscave: this being your message?
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:/
 BlaiseEbuth: This is also a motorhead song btw
 Astrobytes: *your*  prior messages
 Zenoscave: I'm lost now
 MSmits: is this what chat is like when i am not around
 Astrobytes: ANYWAY: BlaiseEbuth: "A waste of good suffering" - name that movie
 BlaiseEbuth: As I said. A motorhead song

 Astrobytes: Oh, gotcha
 Zenoscave: ezpz
 Astrobytes: My bad

 MadKnight: wat
 Astrobytes: (how do you feel working with it I mean
 MadKnight: oooooh
 MadKnight: well they have a really different infrastructure of their entire system
 MadKnight: everything seems to be similar at first, but is actually so much different
 Astrobytes: that's IOS alright
 MadKnight: and some things are actually done badly so they get annoying if u are a dev
 Astrobytes: It's always been like that on any Mac arch in my experience, though the bulk of my experience with that was a while ago :P
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm really tired. Hit me up tomorrow 
 Astrobytes: gn all
 MadKnight: cya
 MadKnight: say cya Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: there are no more moves

 Midnight2441: Got school in the morning, and can't find time to practice coding in school.
 mathiimag: hmm gotcha..  maybe find a way to integrate coding into your assignments
 Midnight2441: Tried that. It took me backtracking the firewall to break the incription enough to use the app again. 
 Midnight2441: They blocked it on my laptop after both incidents.
 Midnight2441: So now, my personal laptop goes to school with me, and I got written up for using it during class.

 King_Coda: *Neumann
 Smelty: hi
 Midnight2441: Hi.
 MajorH5: \/
 MajorH5: hello
 MajorH5: can someone explain why
 MadKnight: hihi
 MajorH5: \\
 MajorH5: \[A-z]\ Matches: "_"
 MajorH5: Should it not only match Alphabetic Uppercase or lowercase character
 MajorH5: \[A-z]\.test("_")
 MajorH5: ^ That evaluates to true?! ^ why
 MadKnight: well take a look at
 MadKnight: how z is lowercase
 MadKnight: while A is uppercase
 MadKnight: why?
 MadKnight: and what does it mean for the range&#160;?
 MadKnight: MajorH5
 MajorH5: Doing it like that means either upper case or lowercase letter
 MadKnight: actually no
 MadKnight: that's not how range thing works
 MajorH5: ok im stupid lol
 WolfDarrigan: time to break out an ASCII table
 MajorH5: thats what the "i" flag is for
 MajorH5: i flag specifies case insensitivity
 MajorH5: then what was i doing?
 Midnight2441: What is the topic now?
 MadKnight: lol how does that explain the _&#160;?
 MajorH5: it does not explain it 
 MajorH5: but
 MajorH5: \[a-z]\i.test("_")
 MajorH5: that is false
 MajorH5: i cant explain why the other does not work. That i dont understand
 MadKnight: so what exactly is A-z&#160;?
 WolfDarrigan: or more specifically, what is 'A'
 MadKnight: look, A-Z is not some magical keyword to specify the alphabet
 MadKnight: it's actually a range of characters
 MajorH5: ah ok
 MajorH5: what is that range?
 MadKnight: basically - from character #A to #z
 MajorH5: OH
 MajorH5: ASCII VALUES
 MadKnight: lo
 MadKnight: l
 MajorH5: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
 MajorH5: oh my god
 MajorH5: thank you&#160;:) it makes sense now haha
 WolfDarrigan: :poultry_leg: we have a winner
 MadKnight: gg
 Midnight2441: I am so confused.
 MadKnight: well do u know what regex is&#160;?
 Midnight2441: No.
 Midnight2441: What is it?
 MadKnight: that is what we are talking about
 Midnight2441: Oh.
 Midnight2441: Duh.
 MadKnight: so u don't know regex and u got confused from us talking about regex
 MadKnight: Duh
 Midnight2441: Cut and clear, yes.

 MadKnight: and of course Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: wonder if i should start
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop ruining all the moments, we finally did something there and then u just ruin it
 Automaton2000: but i couldn't get it to work
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 will i lose my sanity if i keep saying things to u as a way to say things to myself?
 Automaton2000: as long as you have a replay with u
 BigFatDecker: lmao im guessing no one could help?
 MadKnight: BigFatDecker no i asked u what was the previous version
 BigFatDecker: previous verion of what?

 MadKnight: look i had not enough sleep to customize that message enough
 MadKnight: BigFatDecker how? where?
 MadKnight: wait 
 MadKnight: so u were using this variable, then u stopped using this varible but u didn't remove the lines that set a value to it, and now u are asking why it says the value is set but never used?
 BigFatDecker: because its a boolean value i set it to true after each statement in the code
 Midnight2441: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MadKnight: used means getting the value, not setting it
 MadKnight: where do u read the value of this varibale&#160;?
 Andriamanitra: TIL there's more input files when running validators than when running tests in IDE
 Andriamanitra: i tried to save few characters by doing `cat *1.*` instead of `cat in1.txt`&#160;:(
 MadKnight: did u still pass it 10% first try&#160;?
 MadKnight: 100%*
 Midnight2441: Join a room I made called Confused.
 BigFatDecker: oooh ok so would i just set it to true befor the first statemnt so its always listening untill i say ootherwise
 BigFatDecker: im so confused haha
 Midnight2441: As am I.

 BigFatDecker: so how would i fix this?
 MadKnight: Midnight2441 just don't think about these stuffs, it's always about complicated things in here
 MadHatter2441: KK.
 MadKnight: talk to someone like King_Coda instead
 MadHatter2441: Would love to but they went to bed.

 markyy: why is it when I do live stream on twitch playing clash of code, the problems are very hard and has geometry and stuff and when I do not stream they are very easy
 eulerscheZahl: Happy Caturday
 Zenoscave: happy caturday
 eulerscheZahl: I hate this quest that asks you to write a comment on a contribution
 Zenoscave: last quest?
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd quest on the contribution path actually
 Zenoscave: that seems unfortunate
 Zenoscave: spam flood
 eulerscheZahl: and the result: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2?comment=31016">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2?comment=31016</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'll see if that contribution bug still exists
 Zenoscave: which one?
 jrke: euler will you do d&amp;b?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2</a>perfect, comments are gone&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i have no plans jrke
 Zenoscave: does it revoke the quests though?
 eulerscheZahl: no, just a UI thing
 eulerscheZahl: how to delete comments:write a comment in the top levelopen in a new tab and reply to your own comment
 Zenoscave: Still decent QoL improvement&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: then delete the first comment in the previous tab
 eulerscheZahl: so the reply has no child to refer to
 eulerscheZahl: nullpointer, doesn't render any comments
 eulerscheZahl: you can break any contribution comment section this way :D
 jrke: im trying to make trial website with flask,html and css but how can i show that to my friends
 eulerscheZahl: upload it somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: i use herokuapp, it has free hosting
 eulerscheZahl: pythonanywhere is another option
 eulerscheZahl: i tried that one first but it limits internet access in the free version
 eulerscheZahl: so you can access google.com but not codingame.com (working with a whitelist)
 jrke: does herokuapp have unlimited uploading
 eulerscheZahl: you can have up to 5 web projects
 jrke: ok
 eulerscheZahl: you can upload your website again to update the previous version
 jrke: can i update a project various times if i fix any bug?
 eulerscheZahl: you can include libraries via pip requirements file
 eulerscheZahl: my cg puzzle website is in revision 50 or 60 maybe
 eulerscheZahl: that's not an issue at all
 jrke: ah! nice
 eulerscheZahl: you just have to create a git project (local repo or hosted somewhere, up to you)
 eulerscheZahl: then you git push heroku master and the website will update your contribution
 eulerscheZahl: btw they have a good documentation. still took me 1 or 2 hours to upload my project there :D
 eulerscheZahl: was my first experience with web deployment
 jrke: ok
 jrke: whats pipeline?
 eulerscheZahl: in what context?
 jrke: what i have to do in requirments.txt
 eulerscheZahl: have you seen my website?
 jrke: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and the github logo at the top right corner?
 jrke: no i didn't see that
 jrke: send me your website link
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 jrke: oh redirect to git repo
 jrke: lemme read your requirements.txt
 jrke: what should i have to write for flask
 jrke: from flask import Flask, render_template,request,redirect,url_for
 jrke: my header ^
 eulerscheZahl: write:pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
 eulerscheZahl: in your terminal
 jrke: done
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 jrke: ezpz?
 eulerscheZahl: you are too new on CG to experience most of MadKnight first-hand
 eulerscheZahl: easy peasy
 Zenoscave: bah so close to legend
 eulerscheZahl: did you depromote in UTTT or where are you struggling this time?
 Zenoscave: GitC
 eulerscheZahl: that's one of the easier legends IMO
 Zenoscave: Don't have a table of troops yet. It confused me
 Zenoscave: If I could work that out I'd probably be legend.
 Zenoscave: I make inaccurate moves sometimes
 jrke: deployed the website
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://firstakshat.herokuapp.com/">https://firstakshat.herokuapp.com/</a>
 Zenoscave: That or if I can more aggressively INC
 jrke: but error&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but the error message tells you what to do next
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a Procfile?
 jrke: no
 eulerscheZahl: that's mandatory
 eulerscheZahl: to define the entry point of your application
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30178792/heroku-flask-tutorial-procfile-meaning">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30178792/heroku-flask-tutorial-procfile-meaning</a>

 jrke: my rep^
 eulerscheZahl: Add files via upload
 jrke: yeah i uploaded 
 jrke: whats the ext oilef procf
 jrke: whats the ext of procfile*
 eulerscheZahl: no extension
 eulerscheZahl: check my repo
 eulerscheZahl: and i see that you have everything in a web subfolder. that might cause problems too
 eulerscheZahl: at least requirements.txt and Procfile should be in the root
 jrke: ok
 eulerscheZahl: and you will need a guincorn in your requirements to use it in the procfile
 jrke: i made procfile.txt how to remove txt now
 jrke: web: gunicorn setup:app --log-file=-
 eulerscheZahl: first make it Procfile, not procfile
 eulerscheZahl: which operating system?
 jrke: microsoft
 jrke: windows 7
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 eulerscheZahl: in the terminal i should be something likemove procfile.txt Procfile
 eulerscheZahl: windows has a weird default to hide file extensions. not sure if you kept that. if not, just rename the file in the explorer
 eulerscheZahl: at this point MK would suggest a teamviewer session :D
 Zenoscave: Oh I miss those days
 eulerscheZahl: "how's your bot?""which one""don't know"
 Zenoscave: good times
 eulerscheZahl: KiwiBleu even created an alt to keep MK busy explaining CSB
 Zenoscave: I remember that
 Zenoscave: Or am I thinking of Struct
 jrke: move procfile.txt Procfile worked
 eulerscheZahl: where is my struct?&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: i broke him with the JS part :sob:
 jrke: MK said struct remains online on discord
 eulerscheZahl: i see him as offline
 jrke: same error after procfile also
 eulerscheZahl: i told you a few more things to do
 eulerscheZahl: i'm tempted to just make a PR to your repo at this point
 Zenoscave: give a coder a PR... 
 Zenoscave: give a man a fish..
 eulerscheZahl: with a git commit -am "fix it"
 jrke: PR?
 eulerscheZahl: pull request
 jrke: no shortforms to me
 jrke:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: give me a second
 jrke: today i made my first git hub repo :stuck_out_tongue:
 eulerscheZahl: god dammit
 eulerscheZahl: now you made 3 commits after i changed your repo contests
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/trial/commit/288b773341e2c224714c5379e4cff97eaa476b25">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/trial/commit/288b773341e2c224714c5379e4cff97eaa476b25</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and you even deleted relevant files
 jrke: im putting those files to rrot
 jrke: oot*
 jrke: root*
 eulerscheZahl: i made a PR, you could just accept that and move files instead of delete + create somewhere else
 eulerscheZahl: and learn git&#160;;)
 jrke: hmmm....
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Jrkej/trial/pull/1">https://github.com/Jrkej/trial/pull/1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there should be a merge button
 jrke: yes 
 jrke: should i click it?
 eulerscheZahl: only if you trust me
 eulerscheZahl: or review the changes first
 jrke: yeah trust you more than me in case of coding 
 jrke: merged

 eulerscheZahl: you too
 jrke: will see it after breakfast
 eulerscheZahl: it's about 11:30 am where you live, isn't it?
 jrke: yeah it was 11:30
 jrke: my time table messed up
 jrke: actually not mine 
 jrke: whole family
 RobertSaunders: anybody here working on target firing?
 RobertSaunders: im stuck on the swarm in the ide
 RobertSaunders: i pass the rest of them
 RobertSaunders: the only thing i think may improve it in terms of success would be to recalculate the turns to kill after each shot is fired but that would greatly hurt the complexity of the solution
 jrke: euler fixed background
 Xedux: earhbrsgfnmsfxgsnfhymhfbx bgrsnfnsf fgntn xfbf
 Marchete: moin
 eulerscheZahl: great jrke. what was the problem with the background?
 eulerscheZahl: moin markot
 eulerscheZahl: Marchete
 eulerscheZahl: stupid tab completion
 jrke: the pic was named "bg.jpg" instead of "Bg.jpg"
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: works fine on windows
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm pretty sure heroku uses Linux
 jrke: case sensetive
 jrke: yeah i think so cause in my laptop it was working in bg.jpg also
 TheSilent_Boy: hi
 TheSilent_Boy: anyone for python here
 jacek: ohai
 Marchete: now the webchat opens a new tab with a number, and it just says "Loading..."
 jacek: it happened for me the other day
 Marchete: :eyes:
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl I'm using C# for testing DotsAndBox
 Marchete: and it seems the .Net core brings new things
 Marchete: System.Numerics.BitOperations.PopCount
 Marchete: for example
 Marchete: any other goodies useful for CG multis?
 Westicles: huh.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/eng/games/">http://www.js-games.de/eng/games/</a> is gone, euler must have scared them off
 eulerscheZahl: oh&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that was totally not my intention, i just told them to fix it
 Marchete: The requested URL was not found on this server.
 eulerscheZahl: now that it's down I can tell it in public: that site was vulnerable to SQL injection
 eulerscheZahl: i put myself on #1 and probably would have been able to get some user data as well
 Marchete: oh euly tables
 eulerscheZahl: i know the xkcd you are referring to :D
 Marchete: :D
 eulerscheZahl: so, i informed admins about it and gave some more funny ideas
 eulerscheZahl: like: set the username on the first board to 
 Marchete: great, now they'll sue you for trying to help
 eulerscheZahl: that should create a huge comment
 Marchete: evil
 Westicles: Maybe they are just upgrading, or died in a fire or something
 Marchete: seriously is that bad?
 eulerscheZahl: not funny than bad
 eulerscheZahl: btw i broke comments on my teapot contribution
 Marchete: I mean the coding and basic protection
 eulerscheZahl: the jsgames site was 20 years old. and it aged poorly
 eulerscheZahl: the issues were there all the time, just less people with skills to abuse it
 eulerscheZahl: i totally didn't want them to take it offline. just sanatize their inputs
 Marchete: I'll pick bad scalable achievements for 200$, tom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YRHgv1r">https://imgur.com/a/YRHgv1r</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the "write a comment" is what annoyed me
 eulerscheZahl: got lots of "nice", "well done", "great"
 Marchete: I mean, if 100k users wanted to pass that, we will have 100k forced contributions
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2</a>now the comments are hidden :imp:
 Westicles: I rejected some poor guys contribution and didn't even get the achievement
 Marchete: I approved them
 eulerscheZahl: did it get rejected in the end or still pending?
 Marchete: because f*ck that achievement
 Marchete: I mean upvote
 Marchete: not approved
 Westicles: It had two rejections and now seems to be gone
 CyberLemonade: ok so what's the deal with the teapot contrib?
 CyberLemonade: for upvotes?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i'm collecting puzzle stats for my herokuappso i could generate some stats about when they were created, possible clustering after the quest map
 eulerscheZahl: the teapot is to demonstrate the possibility to have 3D on CG obviously
 eulerscheZahl: did you run the code?
 eulerscheZahl: someone just commented my teapot. but not showing :D
 CyberLemonade: what's herokuapp?
 CyberLemonade: yeah I run the code, it was cool
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 CyberLemonade: wow
 CyberLemonade: is it more than just CG?
 eulerscheZahl: has a usersearch for google codejam
 eulerscheZahl: but the puzzles is CG only. including clashes
 Marchete: seriously, you scare me
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 eulerscheZahl: creative commons license&#160;:)
 Marchete: ah, you just hacked me
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;???
 Marchete: you hack everything, that poor js-games, codingame....
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i'm sorry about js-games&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and i broke struct&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: made him deal with javascript for a CG contribution and he just disappeared
 CyberLemonade: ooof
 eulerscheZahl: have i told you how i extracted email addresses of 2 dozen users on riddles?
 dbdr: is extracting public information from CG hacking? :D
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2</a>but i broke the comment functionality here :P
 dbdr: ah, nice&#160;:)
 CyberLemonade: how :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: write a commentopen in a new tab and reply to yourselfdelete the initial comment in the first tab
 dbdr: if CG had a bug bounty program, we could become professionals&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: now we have a comment with a null-pointer parent
 CyberLemonade: yeah I see it's broken, but how?
 eulerscheZahl: known issue already, was posted on discord before
 Marchete: or why?
 CyberLemonade: Marchete yeah
 eulerscheZahl: why:the quest map
 eulerscheZahl: getting comments like "nice", "great" all the time
 Marchete: nice
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.desast.re/pages/2020-08-26-carbon-dating-a-braindead-decision.html">https://cg.desast.re/pages/2020-08-26-carbon-dating-a-braindead-decision.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my list on nonsense was even longer than this
 dbdr: you broke it on purpose because of that?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe :angel:
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5394c708f825e258fe67189a1639d74b86a9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5394c708f825e258fe67189a1639d74b86a9</a>
 Westicles: shouldn't I get an achievement for that?
 Marchete: I said that forecfully doing contribution stuff just polutes the whole idea
 Marchete: it's simply not viable to make everyone contribute with a new puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure how often that updates Westicles, maybe once a day only
 Marchete: and then they need 5 upvotes
 dbdr: I think this had nothing to do with A/B testing
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen some complains about the approval achievement already
 eulerscheZahl: just wait a bit
 Westicles: Oh, I see.  It only happens when everyone agrees, not when you act
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: to be fair, your contribution was a good place for nonsense comments&#160;;)
 Westicles: I had a nice puzzle started on my deleted account, should have saved it
 dbdr: si it's not like you need feedback to decide on publication
 dbdr: *so
 eulerscheZahl: and i totally agree with Marchete and raised that concern too: quality of contributions over quantity. the quest map rewards creating nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: true dbdr, maybe i should just take it down. you guys got the idea
 dbdr: I don't mind it
 eulerscheZahl: 3 days left, then it will be gone anyways
 dbdr: maybe keep it but hidden, so we can still share the link?
 eulerscheZahl: that will happen after these 3 days
 dbdr: ok
 Marchete: that too
 Marchete: quality when you are forced to do something vs willing to do it for nothing in return
 dbdr: probably the effect was amplified because everyone started to do the quest map at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: we had some of those users on the chat before the quests. "i want to create a contribution but i don't know what"
 dbdr: in the long term the effect will be much lower
 eulerscheZahl: maybe JB M went a little over the top
 dbdr: so unlike him&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: making a screenshot of the comments. and saving it as a jpg, seriously? :D
 dbdr: better than a docx&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you won this round
 dbdr: \o/ :D
 dbdr: but "and at the end, the germans win"&#160;;)
 Ashen_024: dbdr what's that badge beside your name, (new here)
 dbdr: moderator
 eulerscheZahl: chat moderator, can kick and ban you
 Ashen_024: Alright
 dbdr: and welcome&#160;:)
 Marchete: DotNet has BitArray, so I don't need to recode C++ bitset,  yay! \o/ 
 eulerscheZahl: BitArray is slow
 eulerscheZahl: at least used to be when i tested it with Mono
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the .net one is more optimized
 Marchete: really?
 Marchete: f*ck
 eulerscheZahl: give it a try
 Marchete: but they have BitOperations
 eulerscheZahl: i wasn't impressed back then
 Marchete: and they said it's like popcount
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it's better now
 dbdr: use the source, Luke

 Marchete: that seems better
 Marchete:   if (Avx2.IsSupported)
 Marchete: I like that
 Marchete: but seems too big
 Marchete: 1000+ lines
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely read library code, i'm surprised by the amount of magic constants they are using
 dbdr: yeah, TIL .NET has explicit SIMD
 eulerscheZahl: likeEnvironment.GetResourceString("ArgumentOutOfRange_Index")
 Ashen_024: is there a way to compare a character with "\" in c++, because usually its used for codes like \0, \n, etc and i think it can't be used normally to be printed as is
 Marchete: System.Runtime.Intrinsics has a lot of stuff
 Marchete: AVX, BMI, etc etc
 eulerscheZahl: write "\\" to get a single \ Ashen_024
 Ashen_024: oww, thanks eulerscheZahl
 Marchete: _pdep_u64  and stuff, it's just inside a namespace and not as intrinsic, noice
 dbdr: Boss 3 in Langton timesout :D
 eulerscheZahl: noob
 dbdr: systematically, apparently
 eulerscheZahl: wait..don't touch that game, i have a decent ranking there&#160;:(

 eulerscheZahl: i even survived the smits
 dbdr: decent + 1 is still decent, no?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, the game wasn't always the way it is now (with 2 matches in 1 game)

 dbdr: eulerscheZahl = #7MSmits = #2
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the boss didn't get an update
 eulerscheZahl: nvm, seems i got pushed down after smits
 eulerscheZahl: or smits returned, dunno
 eulerscheZahl: no TheSilent_Boy
 dbdr: apparently ValGrowth pushed you down
 jrke: which game you are talking about dbdr?
 dbdr: langton-s-ant
 jrke: oh
 jrke: just MC made wood 1
 dbdr: ignoring the opponent?
 jrke: yes
 jrke: oh you are in wood 3 submission going on
 jrke: i think wood 3 is just for fixing timeouts as boss is also timing out as far i remember
 Marchete: intellisense suggested me V[^1] instead of V[V.Count-1] for the last item of a List
 Marchete: what's that ^1?
 eulerscheZahl: end of list
 eulerscheZahl: new c# standard
 eulerscheZahl: like the -1 you know from python indexing
 Marchete: oh, so a new meaning for the XOR...
 Marchete: I love reusing symbols
 jrke: thanks euler for seting up my website&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you're welcome jrkewasn't much left to do if you know which files to touch
 Marchete: and slices too
 eulerscheZahl: while i like the -1 from python more, I see that it's not an option for C#
 eulerscheZahl: should be IndexOutOfRange, would break existing code
 Marchete: yes
 jrke: -1 is used for last item in list in python 
 dbdr: it's also dangerous to have a negative index by mistake
 dbdr: better to crash than to get an invalid behaviour
 eulerscheZahl: true. the ^ makes your intent more clear
 dbdr: not convinced it's worth the complication though
 eulerscheZahl: so you aren't sure if it needs ranges and indexing from the end at all?
 TheSilent_Boy: Hi everyone!
 dbdr: indexing from the end
 eulerscheZahl: on the one hand it's faster to writethe downside is that it raises the bar for new programmers when more and more syntactic sugar gets thrown in
 dbdr: exactly, it's a tradeoff
 eulerscheZahl: very non-intuitive as Marchete just pointed out by asking the question
 dbdr: could even be a typo :D
 dbdr: though I guess that could be true of other syntax
 eulerscheZahl: type ^nothing appears on the screen
 eulerscheZahl: type the 1 =&gt; ¹
 eulerscheZahl: i mean ^1
 eulerscheZahl: my keyboard layout is different :D
 dbdr: I get that with Alt-^
 dbdr: nice, I didn't know, thanks!
 dbdr: ⁹
 eulerscheZahl: i type ^^ to get a single ^and whenever i have to use a windows, i screw it up
 dbdr: ^ =&gt; ^RightAlt-^ 9 =&gt; ⁹
 eulerscheZahl: RightAlt?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean AltGr?
 dbdr: right Alt on the right on space
 eulerscheZahl: AltGr+^ = ′
 dbdr: it's written Alt on my kbd, but yes, that one
 dbdr: I also set up AltGr g a =&gt; α
 dbdr: works for all greek letters
 eulerscheZahl: ¹²³¼½¬{[]}\ł€¶ŧ←↓→øþæſðđŋħł«¢„“”µ·…–
 eulerscheZahl: that's why I get with AltGr
 dbdr: α² - β³ = γ⁻¹
 dbdr: AltGr ^ - =&gt; ⁻ also works
 dbdr: superscript -
 eulerscheZahl: ²·⁷¹⁸²⁸¹⁸²⁸⁴⁵⁹⁰
 jacek: �
 dbdr: sadly there is no superscript . and , 
 dbdr: in unicode
 eulerscheZahl: there is a point on half height
 dbdr: yeah, middle dot
 dbdr: it's not semantically the same, but visually it kinda works

 dbdr: nice hardcoded pattern by blue
 eulerscheZahl: should be great for lower leagues where you have your own board
 jrke: yeah hardcoded pattern works but in solo board
 dbdr: yes, and I don't yet score colors differently, so I see no reason to disrupt it :D
 dbdr: I play a coop game now :D
 jrke: oh thats the problem
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl, there is a new way to do a Deep copy in Dotnet?
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: is that a question?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i think i vaguely remember
 dbdr: use Deep Learning Marchete&#160;;)
 jrke: when i started in wood 5 from that stage i made code which will make me easier to update two color games in upper league 
 eulerscheZahl: there was something about copying objects and changing 1 or 2 attributes on the way
 jrke: and i made wood 2 in 2.5 hours  and wood 1 next day

 Marchete: is there*, yes it was a question
 dbdr: there, blue pattern&#160;;)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/485325242">https://www.codingame.com/replay/485325242</a>
 dbdr: that game is quite popular, for a contrib
 fasil: hy
 eulerscheZahl: it's one of the first community contributions
 eulerscheZahl: nowadays it's too many to choose from
 dbdr: yeah, and also number just grows with time
 dbdr: hy fasil
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd community multiplayer, just 2 weeks after vindinium even
 dbdr: I mean number of players
 dbdr: and uTTT was 0th&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes. that one has a massive popularity that i still don't understand
 eulerscheZahl: even more than some previous contests
 dbdr: maybe because TTT is so easy and famous?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe
 eulerscheZahl: bitrunner is a little over-performing compared to other games with similar age
 dbdr: because of WarGames&#160;:)
 dbdr: BR because of unoff contest maybe
 dbdr: or masochism
 eulerscheZahl: did they redesign the category tags on the overview page?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: btw uTTT was released the day BotG ended
 dbdr: I know I started it because of the end of contest void, maybe others too
 eulerscheZahl: yet the number wasn't around 1k instantly
 eulerscheZahl: it slowly climbed
 dbdr: ok
 Marchete: unpopular opinion: uTTT is boring, there are much much better games around
 dbdr: uTTT is one of the best showcases for MCTS, no?
 dbdr: so it has its place
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not into it either. but as long as it has its fan-base it deserves to be here
 dbdr: strange, I promoted not that high above the boss, and won 9/10 in wood 1
 dbdr: probably the skill curve is rather flat
 dbdr: but #2 is way above #3 and #1 way above #1 :D
 dbdr: so not true at the top
 dbdr: #1 &gt; #2
 ZoeLogiiK: O.O
 ZoeLogiiK: This is my first time using This website.
 eulerscheZahl: welcome to CodinGame
 ZoeLogiiK: How much do you guys use this platform?
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, i don't want to talk about my addictions now
 dbdr: :D
 Marchete: euler use it only once
 Marchete: for 4 years straight
 eulerscheZahl: luckily i already had my bachelors degree when i found out about CG
 Ashen_024: 4 years? why didn't i hear about this platform earlier man, I'm loving it here
 Ashen_024: I'm already in last year of my bachelors now
 eulerscheZahl: for the multiplayer section the website exists for 6 years already
 eulerscheZahl: the puzzle section is even older, maybe 8 years
 ZoeLogiiK: Yea, I just recieved my bachelors a couple of years ago
 ZoeLogiiK: BUt I haven;t really took the Coding route.
 ZoeLogiiK: Wondering if this a good platform to acutally get better in Python.
 Marchete: no
 dbdr: yes, if you aready know the basics, it can be a good plaftorm to practice and have fun at the same time
 jacek: we have apparently two opposing views
 MSmits: I guess it depends on what skill level you're at
 MSmits: at the start it's definitely good practice, but maybe when you get ready for some bigger projects, CG may teach you some bad practices
 MSmits: this is true for any language
 MSmits: I would horrify professional c++ coders I'm sure
 MSmits: hey Marchete, I am trying graphs for D&amp;B
 MSmits: for the endgame solver that is
 MSmits: it's pretty difficult
 jrke: MS any new strategy for D&amp;B
 MSmits: are you asking me?
 MSmits: currently, I am trying to get a working minimax for non-simple loony endgames. I think I am getting close. It's difficult because I am not used to graph structures
 MSmits: and also, because this is a very complicated graph
 MSmits: lot's of disconnecting and reconnecting strings between joins and such
 MSmits: and some joins connecting to themselves through loops
 jacek: graphs eh
 MSmits: it makes sense to use them for the endgames for complex structures
 MSmits: the most complicated ones have around 12 joins (less than 1 out of  a million), but most have less
 MSmits: that means that the graph will have at most 12 nodes, but there can be many links between them
 Marchete: in fact I'm trying in C#
 Marchete: easier for graphs than C++
 MSmits: and if you remove 1 link from a 3-join, it's no longer a join and it's joins are merged
 MSmits: Marchete thats true. 
 MSmits: I have to say i am doing it differently from that paper you shared though
 Marchete: well, I'm not copying it either
 Marchete: I dislike "subchains"
 MSmits: what are you doing for chains and loops?
 MSmits: is a chain or loop a single object or multiple connected ones?
 MSmits: say you have a chain of length 4, is it 4 objects, or 1 object?
 Marchete: Gamestate-&gt;chains-&gt;boxes
 Marchete: anything is a chain
 MSmits: ahh ok, I don't have the boxes
 MSmits: just the chain
 MSmits: it has a size
 MSmits: the reason is that for the game state i still use the bitboard, I only convert to a graph when the endgame starts
 Marchete: for me a chain has N boxes
 Marchete: and each box E edges
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: that way the graph is very simple
 MSmits: in many cases just 2 nodes with 6 or so strings
 Marchete: anyways I'm just testing stuff
 Marchete: like just enjoying it
 Marchete: reading, coding a bit and that
 MSmits: yeah, i am kind of enjoying it, but sometimes it's frustrating
 MSmits: you remember dancing links right?
 MSmits: I was trying to use that method of disconnecting and reconnecting strings
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: but it doesnt work, because the left of one join doesnt necessarily connect to the right of the other
 Marchete: I just do the dirty way, floodfill to detect new chains
 MSmits: so you have to track more information
 Marchete: not very advanced
 MSmits: ah I do the floodfill one time
 Marchete: but I think metadata from graphs are important in that game
 MSmits: when converting from bitboard to graph
 MSmits: yeah i think I may need to do more with graphs, but I want to focus on getting an endgame solver first
 MSmits: my next working bot will play random moves until end game starts and then play perfectly
 MSmits: I am guessing that will probably be easy top 5
 MSmits: will be a while still before I get all the bugs out and make it work in my live bot
 dbdr: you have a dead bot?&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah offline
 MSmits: it's ded
 dbdr: rip
 MSmits: just a local program I use to experiment with. It's kind of fun to generate different endgames and try different things to solve them efficiently
 LeRenard: publicity&#160;: Hello. I updated the Penguins game. It is now possible in league 2 to push another penguin in the sea.
 eulerscheZahl: Penguins game? :confused:
 eulerscheZahl: tell me more about that
 dbdr: it's in contrib
 LeRenard: in contribution. Multiplayer in Work in Progress
 LeRenard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/85088816f2a1919ad6fe6e453e9e07a9dd368e">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/85088816f2a1919ad6fe6e453e9e07a9dd368e</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i totally missed that
 eulerscheZahl: found it now
 LeRenard:&#160;:-(
 eulerscheZahl: tux on hex board, nice
 eulerscheZahl: "ach ice block contains a quantity of fishes"is there even a plural for fish?
 AntiSquid: looks like a CNN problem
 AntiSquid: yes euler
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 MSmits: watching CNN right now
 eulerscheZahl: better than Fox &amp; friends
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: the exact opposite of neurons MSmits
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: but LeRenard is a fox :thinking:
 AntiSquid: good game idea though LeRenard
 MSmits: it looks cool!
 MSmits: that animated gif&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the wing part is edited
 eulerscheZahl: also saw it with putting a foot
 MSmits: no doubt, but still cool
 eulerscheZahl: can't download sourcecode&#160;:(
 LeRenard: I clean the code and i will release it
 LeRenard: If the game has success. Il propose it and release the code

 Cybgy: What's the schedule for "Fall Challenge 2020"?
 eulerscheZahl: mid november

 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl I think my path dists are wrong. I never use the middle (0) factory
 eulerscheZahl: looks fine to me
 eulerscheZahl: that's mine:
 Zenoscave: must be some other bug then.

 Zenoscave: Minimizing hops is good?
 Zenoscave: I thought you'd want to maximize
 eulerscheZahl: i do maximize
 eulerscheZahl: wait...
 Zenoscave: I read the wrng sign . nevermind
 Zenoscave: You definitely maximize

 cyberfrend: I have to count the circles in a number and the last test case was 5648 1124 8956 5487 5624 45556 564561 215487 and the expected output was 15. How is that 15?
 jacek: what other number did you expect
 cyberfrend: ah they don't count the 4 as a circles nevermind
 eulerscheZahl: i guess it's <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/14469b605b22b1554aa3fc5746dea60ebf37">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/14469b605b22b1554aa3fc5746dea60ebf37</a>
 cyberfrend: Also it seems like clash of code uses amount of characters as a criterium. What's the rational behind that? Why not performance?
 Enknable: that's only in code golf
 cyberfrend: What? So how do they decide who wins Clash of Code?
 Enknable: code golf is # of characters, everthing else is who submits first
 Enknable: given that you get 100% on the test cases
 cyberfrend: @Enknable okay thanks for the clarification
 jacek: there are 3 modes chosen at random for clash. fastest, reverse and codegold
 darkhorse64: jacek does not like my oneliner Top Bronze HS bot.
 darkhorse64: Don't understand why
 Bobbadillio: lol, can you get top bronze just by playing the most expensive card you have in hand, and maybe attacking?
 Denshire: so I just started the Spring Challenge 2020 and I can't see any width-height constraints. Are there any?
 arthurguedes: start it&#160;:)
 arthurguedes: pls
 arthurguedes: pls
 arthurguedes: i dont want to wait 1:06 minutes
 SPDene: wrong chat arthurguedes&#160;?
 Denshire: Hey, friend, I think you're looking for the clash chat.
 arthurguedes: ohh, im sorry, yeah haha
 Denshire: no prob&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you should be
 AntiSquid: how's life everyone?
 DomiKo: really slow right now
 AntiSquid: true
 DomiKo: can't wait for october
 AntiSquid: or maybe they are fast in the background?
 AntiSquid: things are fast *
 DomiKo: that could be it
 AntiSquid: must run a system debloater
 DomiKo: ohh yes
 DomiKo: everybody need that I guess
 MandresyAndri: hello

 Enknable: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 Enknable: Anyone...?
 Enknable: Only happen periodically..and I'm reading all the input..
 MidSizeTexan: Yes, I get that all the time.&#160;:)
 MidSizeTexan: Happens when you take too long before writing to output.
 MidSizeTexan: Or when you write to output before all the input is read
 Enknable: hmm..I'm using high:res clock to break out of my loops and setting them 30ms before the time limit
 Enknable: If I have member functions in a struct, and I implicitly copy that struct, will it only copy the struct member variables or make copies of the member functions as well?
 DaNinja: just the variables
 Enknable: I kinda thought so. I was hoping I could redefine the functions outside the structs and shave off a huge chunk of time but..
 Enknable: :weary:

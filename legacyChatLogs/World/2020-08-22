 Laminator: Wow totally just did shortest mode on a reverse. 
 Allis: Gotta go fast.
 Crazycw99: Whats up?
 Allis: A matter of perspective.
 Gorbit99: Allis have you seen that I've found a new and good method of blocking the autocomplete?
 Allis: Oh?
 Gorbit99: (on chrome that is, working on the ff version)
 alanhong: im hacking nasa with html
 Allis: Godspeed, alanhong.
 Allis: Gorbit99, a userscript that calls into the editor directly?
 Zuabros: hey people lats do some clash of code
 Gorbit99: almost, it calls into the monaco module
 Allis: Published somewhere?
 Gorbit99: to be exact, it calls the function monaco.languages.registerCompletionItemProvder without arguments (because js) and that kinda messes with it
 Gorbit99: of course, I even made a forum post
 Allis: Zuabros, why not try?
 Gorbit99: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/disable-all-of-your-autocomplete-with-this-simple-script/185970/3">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/disable-all-of-your-autocomplete-with-this-simple-script/185970/3</a>
 Allis: Very nice. Thanks!
 Gorbit99: you need tampermonkey for it
 Zuabros: @allis got sleepy just to read this. 
 Gorbit99: the only problem with ff is that greasemonkey has different timings or something
 Gorbit99: I need monaco to exist when this gets called for obvious reasons
 Gorbit99: also, there are a few other register functions to remove certain other popups
 Gorbit99: right now even with this extension, you will get stuff like function signature help
 Gorbit99: but of course, if you just add the call to "monaco.languages.registerSignatureHelpProvider()" that will solve itself
 Gorbit99: aaaand got it to work with ff too
 Gorbit99: time to test it with tampermonkey
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday
 jrke: oh i forgot its caturday 
 Gorbit99: happy caturday
 jrke: happy caturday
 jrke: hey gorbit99 how is your samegame going?
 Gorbit99: haven't touched it, on vacation
 Gorbit99: I'm only online because it's 7 am and I was the one unfortunate soul to wake up early after a night of drinking
 Gorbit99: Posted a new script to get rid of the signature help popup too
 Gorbit99: now nothing can block your screen as far as I'm aware
 jacek: happy Caturday
 field3: atari go 9x9 Approved because it is difficult to survive.The trick is to make two eyes to survive.:relaxed:
 jacek: atari go has 4 leagues?
 jacek: 9x9
 field3: Personally, I had the most fun at Codin Game this yearIf you learn Go, you can enjoy it for the rest of your life.:relieved:
 jrke: yeah my first bot programming in which im first
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ummm jrke dots and boxes?
 jrke: yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: umm, u #1
 jrke: yeah 1st 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: though u was talking about go
 jrke: oh your submission is also evaluating in wood 2 above boss i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, i should be with the big dogs soon enough
 jrke: cause boss is something 20 points you are 23.65
 jrke: yeah i know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i won every game or had like 5 draws
 jrke: but the thing is i got 37.95 points in wood 1 which is too good for me
 jrke: yeah i am seeing your battles patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wood1 started
 jacek: ahh morning wood?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oooh 7x7 board
 jrke: welcome to wood 1&#160;:)
 jrke: jacek whats your current algo in D&amp;B minimax?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I setup structure and datablock for minmax, but I only just did greedy move or random box w/o 2 poss. moves...pretty simple
 jrke: whats your depth&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh its zero at the moment, rofl
 jrke: depth 0?
 jacek: i just use heuristic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I didn't run the minmax yet, I just allocated all the memory for the tree
 jacek: avoid 2 edges squares and play 1 edge squares
 PatrickMcGinnisII: structures are in place, but they aren't used yet
 jrke: oh
 jrke: currently i have few bugs but no idea how to fix them though i tried it but no results :confused:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like for 5102 nodes I use 275544 in memory.
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, some obvious bugs. like frame 97 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483015294">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/483015294</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, should be twice that for 5k nodes...i screwed something up
 jrke: euler frame 98 or 97 whatever its not bug its a strategy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe my strategy needs evolving, tx for replay
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are right. well played even
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well I settled in mediocre land in leaderboard as expected
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well, thats it.  goodnight.
 jrke: gn patrick
 jrke: its shining sun here :stuck_out_tongue:
 jrke: is there any tool by which i can play various matches offline against particular player
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/mvqwSu.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/mvqwSu.jpg</a>will I promote? suspense is high...

 jrke: thanks dbdr
 jrke: how to make it run?
 dbdr: poor field3 stuck without any matches
 dbdr: did you read the documentation? :D
 eulerscheZahl: TL;DR :D
 dbdr: if not that it's TS;DU
 eulerscheZahl: too short, didn't understand?
 dbdr: ^ this guy guesses ^
 eulerscheZahl: did you just make this up or is it a thing?
 dbdr: both
 dbdr: it's a thing now
 dbdr: hm, if a boss starts very negative, you might loses against it and still promote :D
 dbdr: only if there are few matches though
 jrke: 9*9 go is here
 jrke: i just saw
 dbdr: lol: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/483020701">https://www.codingame.com/replay/483020701</a>
 field3: ï¼Ÿ:thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: you got destroyed
 dbdr: a bit
 dbdr: capture of 80, cannot do better :D
 dbdr: prooves 9x9 is very different from 19x19
 eulerscheZahl: more difference than for coders of the realm 2p vs 4p?
 field3: .Except for Seki, go cannot survive unless it has two complete eyes.
 dbdr: isn't the reason for that that you cannot do a 2p or 4p but not 3p game?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, didn't follow the discussion
 dbdr: but you know the SDK. I think it has min and maxplayers only, right?
 eulerscheZahl: right. with 2 and 4 there is also 3
 eulerscheZahl: just saying i don't know the game well enough to judge if there is a 3 player version
 jrke: yeah hypersonic,tron battle have 3 players battles
 eulerscheZahl: you can't compare those with SDK contributions anyways
 dbdr: you could have a 3rd player that never gets a turn, and always finished 2nd :D
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. we don't have the possibility to rotate positions in SDK games
 eulerscheZahl: or have higher leagues than wood
 dbdr: it's possible if CG enables it, I think
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but nothing the uploader can do
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/atari-go-9x9/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/atari-go-9x9/leaderboard</a>probably the lowest scores ever
 dbdr: nobody above 10.0
 eulerscheZahl: especially field is really disappointing

 Thyl: Hello
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 Thyl: Why make a int tab
 Thyl: in the int tab 2 in tab
 Thyl: in C
 Thyl:&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: me no understand
 Thyl: ok
 Thyl: I start traduct
 Thyl: Google traduct&#160;:)
 Thyl: How to make an array containing 2 integer array in C
 eulerscheZahl: int array[2] = {1,2};
 dbdr: 2d array I think
 Thyl: It's my code
 eulerscheZahl: 2D? that's now what I read
 eulerscheZahl: your turn dbdr

 Thyl: Sorry eulerscheZahl
 dbdr: int p[][] is what's called a 2D array
 AntiSquid: what is the difference between the 2 games of go&#160;?
 dbdr: board size
 dbdr: and that I fail miserably at 9x9
 AntiSquid: is 9x9 smaller? smaller boards should be easier for bots :p
 dbdr: it's also easier for you opponent, so not really easier
 dbdr: and 9x9 fills up while 19x19 does not, so endgame is different
 field3: I was also programming and thought it was different, so I approved it.
 jrke: i m scared by wood 3 boss just by looking dbdr battles history
 dbdr: jrke, don't worry, it's not the boss that's good, it's my bot who is stupid
 dbdr: I suspect it's just that it does not know that it is allowed to pass
 jrke: i am lucky cause currently im learning minimax and various new bot programming are there in which minimax can be used
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.videocardz.com/1/2020/08/NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3090-1-1.jpg">https://cdn.videocardz.com/1/2020/08/NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3090-1-1.jpg</a>
 jacek: simple minimax? or also alpha-beta and/or iterative deepening

 noob-boi: i need some help
 jrke: whats the help?
 shawn_the_goat: help with what&gt;

 Monsieur_Pook: interface is very cluttered
 jacek: huh
 Zuabros: hello
 Zuabros: lets have some clash
 AntiSquid: where this peopla coming from?
 AntiSquid: these people *
 jacek: from... Internet
 eulerscheZahl: from a parallel universe where clashing is popular
 AntiSquid: i think you were raised on the internet jacek
 squeals: :metal:
 AntiSquid: hey euler codejam starts in 6 days, are you participating?
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2020">https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2020</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's not what i expected when you wrote "codejam"
 AntiSquid: i know
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't look interesting at all to me
 AntiSquid: was a joke 
 eulerscheZahl: open topic, do what you want and we'll judge itfine, but without me
 AntiSquid: i am subscribed to the guy's youtube channel, he has some interesting videos about c++ stuff, but he announced that, name seemed familiar so found out it's not what it seems, so best solution was to post it here and try to get someone excited for no reason
 eulerscheZahl: you were close but i know the usual schedule
 eulerscheZahl: and the winner
 eulerscheZahl: tourist, 7x in a row
 AntiSquid: always same winner?
 AntiSquid: how can he code with all the noise outside? (belarus had riots recently)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure where he lives currently. competes for a Russian university at ICPC
 dbdr: it's not like any protest noise covers any large&#160;% of a country
 dbdr: actually I heard IT was a growing sector in Minsk
 jacek: was?
 dbdr: we would need a native speaker, but I think that's how you would normally say it. I heard in the past, so it was is also in the past
 dbdr: I'm not implying it's not anymore
 dbdr: of course internet cuts don't help, but hopefully that won't last
 eulerscheZahl: but not a native speaker like Zeno. He gets easily confused when it comes to grammar :D
 dbdr: :D
 Mykes: pepega clap
 dbdr: it used to be growing. it still is, but it used to, too
 jrke: where is astrobytes from last few days?

 Monsieur_Pook: why is the interface so cluttered?
 JBM: because the devs made it so
 Monsieur_Pook: bad decision
 JBM: you tell them
 dbdr: feel free to do better
 eulerscheZahl: make your own CG website. with hookers and black jack
 dbdr: haven't you already done that eulerscheZahl?
 dbdr: waiting for the release...
 dbdr: also, that sounds cluttered
 eulerscheZahl: nah, way over my level.but i'm good at making ugly UIs
 TheSpiffiest: What are the commands for the editor? Somehow I changed all my text in the web IDE panel to super tiny, but the rest of the page is OK
 dbdr: Ctrl + mousewheel to change font size
 TheSpiffiest: Thank you! I must have done it by accident and I couldn't figure a keyboard combo

 MrHowitzer: ooh! hello all. literally just got access to the chat.
 Memo12334: jrke ya rlly 13 yrs old
 jrke: yes
 Memo12334: wow
 Memo12334: people rank up by doing clash of code or?
 Memo12334: I mean like ascending in ranks
 jrke: just clashing can give you max 5000-10000 rank if you are good in clashing
 jrke: bot programming is important for rank
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: What are this certifications on home page for?
 JBM: bragging rights
 Memo12334: JBM
 Memo12334: can I ask u something if u don't mind
 JBM: i don't know
 JBM: hard to tell without seeing the quesation
 Memo12334: I want to begin bot programming and there are so many choices. Idk which to choose
 JBM: yeah
 JBM: neither do i
 Memo12334: ok ty
 JBM: np
 Ak47aman: Hello Friends
 jacek: start with trolls and castles
 JBM: oh, right
 JBM: that's actually a better suggestion than csb
 JBM: i should think of it more spontaneously
 JBM: jacek++
 inoryy: what is this heresy in my church of csb
 Memo12334: aaay jacek I appreciate
 Memo12334: uh I can't find it
 jacek: there is another awesome game. it has :soccer: in it
 jacek: trolls isnt approved yet
 Memo12334: bruh
 dbdr: TVC is about one week away from being validatedand always will be
 Memo12334: is a masters in maths or CS needed
 eulerscheZahl: no, smits proved that a PhD in physics is fine too
 Memo12334: nvm found it , coders stirke back is the one everyone should begin with if it's the first time
 inoryy: good choice
 JBM: here's TVC for those who can't find the link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/84238477bff184d6523d9b7b6a0dd0790496d8">https://www.codingame.com/demo/84238477bff184d6523d9b7b6a0dd0790496d8</a>

 eulerscheZahl: agade has one too
 Memo12334: maybe to get #1 
 JBM: just to understand the collision model
 JBM: the rest is ezpz
 JBM: or so i've heard

 hero_comes: hello everyone
 BlueCat: Hi there
 DemonShadow90: Hello Guys
 Schwase: hello
 Schwase: this is YOUR daily dose of internet
 Schwase: @JBM i won a fruit counting clash yesterday. I dedicate my win to you my friend
 Goldian: hellow my frineds
 aammeerraak: hi just asking it is a bit hard for my to get the code without looking at the algorithm this is my third code is that normal? and how can i improve my skills thanks y'all.
 Schwase: gg katz
 Schwase: i dont understand your question?
 aammeerraak: is it normal not to know how to solve the problem
 aammeerraak: i have to look at the algorithm or may be the code itself 
 aammeerraak: to understand what i have to do
 aammeerraak:  and how can i improve my problem solving skills
 Schwase: yes it is normal
 Schwase: how to improve: do more puzzles and clashes
 Schwase: also learn more code approaches
 aammeerraak: okay thank u 
 Schwase: what language do you use to code?
 aammeerraak: c++
 aammeerraak: i am learning c++ at university and trying to learn js alone 
 jacek: js is popular for clash
 aammeerraak: anyone learning c++
 aammeerraak:&#160;?
 aammeerraak: or js?
 itzblinkzy: js
 aammeerraak: self learning or what?
 itzblinkzy: yep
 itzblinkzy: tutorials on yt 
 itzblinkzy: and stuff like that
 AntiSquid: lol the madao arguments :D
 itzblinkzy: after im decent with js ill move over to c++
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 do you miss MadKnight&#160;?
 Automaton2000: so it was the other way around
 AntiSquid: i see
 aammeerraak: what should i do after learning the syntax of programming language 
 AntiSquid: make use of it
 healy: Build stuff, basically
 healy: As simple as that sounds, remember that programming languages are *languages*; you won't get better until you start speaking (using) them.
 aammeerraak: does problem solving count&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: build a 3D cube or do CSB
 aammeerraak: using c++?
 AntiSquid: yes
 healy: It... does and it doesn't. Solving problems can help you write cleaner code, but sites like, for example Leetcode don't always directly translate to "good" real-world code
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw</a>then<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEb2akswCcw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEb2akswCcw</a>
 AntiSquid: aammeerraak&#160;?
 healy: It depends also obviously on exactly what we mean by "problems". If the problem is "I wanna build a game involving XYZ", then yes, that is a problem that will count. If it's just your boring old "Write a function to determine if N is prime in O(âˆšN) time", then...
 healy: I guess my point is just try to do both&#160;:)
 theBatman: aammmeerraak u should try coding on sites like coding game hackerrank once u learn hoew to implement ur code to solve a problem u can try making some projects. Hope it Helps!
 AntiSquid:  you don't really need coding to create games, see unity and other engines that do the work for you
 AntiSquid: and avoid hackerrank
 AntiSquid: and avoid recruitment agents that contact you on hackerrank too
 aammeerraak: @AntiSquid thanks
 jacek: avoid csv *.*
 jacek: csb
 morcod: @AntiSquid why
 morcod:&#160;??
 AntiSquid: ya good question? why avoid csv? it's file format that datasets usually come in 
 healy: Well, I don't explicitly mean games; in fact, I'd say that's a bit of a stretch goal if you're a beginner (tho i dunno; I'm not a C++ person!).Just that you shouldn't necessarily stick yourself in the "I must only solve Hackerrank style problems until I'm blue in the face", or worse that you should *force* yourself to program (rather than finding a project you enjoy and working on that)
 morcod: @Antisquid hmm,no why avoid hackerrank and agencies ,because im interested by getting a job in programing 
 AntiSquid: c++ projects btw with tutorials healy aammeerraak <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning">https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning</a>
 healy: Why are we avoiding the Chemical Safety Board? What have we been doing in here? :fearful:
 healy: @AntiSquid nice, yeh, that's sorta what I mean. Projects, not just algorithms. Thx
 AntiSquid: ah imo they suck and because i can avoid them morcod, do as you wish, was just advice, just submit a CV to a company you like or call them and see what they are looking for, often it's good practice to make sure you tell them you're not a recruitment agent btw, they do get pestered with calls
 aammeerraak: can i use that as a beginner  
 AntiSquid: yes
 aammeerraak: i know the syntax of c++
 morcod: Thank you for advice&#160;:)
 aammeerraak: and i did study the opp
 aammeerraak: oop **
 AntiSquid: you can use anything as a beginner . if a step isn't clear you pause and google for a tutorial or something to explain you that step aammeerraak
 morcod: i think  a portfolio is mandatory&#160;!!
 aammeerraak: thank u  @AntiSquid 
 AntiSquid: no problem you welcome
 AliZainAldeen: any tips to have self confidence in cp&#160;?like i can solve alot of hard problems but not when i am asked to do it
 JBM: Schwase: thanks :D
 Zebula: Seems like this website is geared more towards individuals who are already developers. Someone who is new and doesn't understand syntax, if a language is case sensitive etc wouldn't be well suited to use this site. Is that a fair statement?
 kschang77: This site is for people who want to learn to solve problems programmatically. 
 Zebula: Right, but if they don't understand the fundamentals, they won't be able to solve them. Not knowing what an "if" statement is, loops etc
 kschang77: It'd be like trying to run before one can walk, yes. 
 Zm4j: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf</a>
 Zm4j: maybe this can help you start
 Jamesythelegend: Yeah but realistically you only need a day or so to learn the basics of a language before you can start working on solutions on this website
 Zebula: Gotcha. Was looking for a site to teach me languages like C# or C++ beforehand to get a leg up before college courses. Guess I'll check elsewhere 
 Zm4j: you can try this link i sent here, see if you can understand, it is good for start
 Zebula: I'll check it out. Thank you
 Memo12334: uhm anyone online
 Schwase: no
 Gorbit99: nah, noone
 Memo12334: the bot progrmming thing , im doing submit it battles and then nothing
 Schwase: which one
 Gorbit99: check the "last battles" thingy
 Gorbit99: it might just be going on
 Memo12334: uhm it takes rlly long then
 Memo12334: is that normal
 Schwase: i can answer questions about java, classic puzzles, and the contribution page
 Gorbit99: yes
 Schwase: not much else
 Gorbit99: it does take long
 Memo12334: ok because it was 100% and then I clicked somewhere else and then submit again and its doing it all over again right
 Memo12334: wait, where do I have to look. Battles in progress?
 EcksDee: thats the way it works Memo12334, resubmitting is "starting over" in your current league
 Gorbit99: wiat it out
 Gorbit99: wait*
 Memo12334: noooooo Iwas in top 50
 EcksDee: what multi, and what league?
 Memo12334: coders strike back bronz V
 EcksDee: usually about the 10 first matches decides where about you should be ranked, then the rest will boost/drop your score/rank
 EcksDee: oh nice work, you just started it a few days ago right?
 Memo12334: I started bot programming today, some hours ago
 Memo12334: I did ~20 easy challenges and 3 medium and now trying to be an AI dev
 EcksDee: damn, well done&#160;:)
 Memo12334: ty but ye not rlly. I had a hard time
 Memo12334: so it got to 100% and after it's fighting again and will it ever stop or do I have to improve my code
 EcksDee: you will get more matches when others submit in your league and fight your bot. otherwise no not untill you submit again
 Memo12334: ok im lost, I beat this boss 3 and submitted , waited till 100% and nothing
 EcksDee: what rank if you press leaderboard?
 TheSpiffiest: are there any hints on "code of the rings" optimization?  I'm making things smaller, but wondering if there's some algorithm I should read up on for this type of thing
 TheSpiffiest: I have 100%, but not sure where to begin making it smaller
 EcksDee: you have beat both the other players below boss and boss itself while submitting is going. and to fight the boss your bot first have to be at the top
 Memo12334: I found my self at 423 :S , I tell with shame
 EcksDee: doing golf TheSpiffiest?
 TheSpiffiest: Sort of, but for the movements, not the code
 EcksDee: then you have to improve it before fighting the boss doing a submit&#160;;)
 TheSpiffiest: lots of code the optimizes minimal moves

 TheSpiffiest: Oh - nope.  I'll check those out
 TheSpiffiest: I jumped there from the quest map and jumped straight to solve it. Forgot to go back to start after
 EcksDee: there are always (i think) links for algorithms or approaches that the puzzle is aiming for to be used, good idea to check them out&#160;:)
 TheSpiffiest: Sweet... I've got google interviews and I haven't done this stuff for 20 years.  I used to crank this stuff out in my sleep, but to be honest I haven't used it for at least 12 years.
 Memo12334: but ya want to work at NASA
 TheSpiffiest: That's my original plan, to put robots on the moon. But then the google job starts at $300k so...
 TheSpiffiest: It can wait a while
 Memo12334: ok that's rlly a lot ;p
 EcksDee: damn, where do you apply :p
 TheSpiffiest: Not sure, they contacted me
 TheSpiffiest: recruiter from linked in. I'm 6 interviews in 
 EcksDee: nice, good luck then&#160;:)
 JBM: for which site?
 Erythion: ... isn't that code of the rings puzzle just telling yo uto write brainfuck code? lol
 JBM: precicely
 TheSpiffiest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://careers.google.com/">https://careers.google.com/</a>
 JBM: that'd be with an s
 JBM: i meant physically

 Erythion: the weekly puzzle didn't cover up anything, so I assumed it's fine ._.
 EcksDee: yea, just a silly joke
 JBM: i go with mind shag
 JBM: but that's just me
 EcksDee: ah, yea i knew i was remembering it wrong xD
 TheSpiffiest: well whatever we call it, it's very similar to the interview problems.  
 JBM: me and my ramblings
 TheSpiffiest: I like the ramblings going buy.  Pretty interesting stuff
 Memo12334: ah now I got it&#160;:) , it's fun 
 Memo12334: TheSpiffiest do you need that much abstract thinking tho for job. just curious
 Memo12334: the work u are going to do
 TheSpiffiest: I just need to make sure I understand the tools, data structures and algorithms that exist
 TheSpiffiest: Not sure of the work, I got to the part where they said pick a job and they will interview for that specifically
 aZ: is there supposed to be an animation when I submit my code?
 aZ: I just see black screen and a yellow bar that progresses
 AntiSquid: F5
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I go off codingame for a week and get 3 achievements and a promotion... maybe if I wait a year I'll get to legend in CSB :D
 Martnart:&#160;::
 procamania: this seems to be hard for a beginner
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Not really, if you have some knowledge already, you can get to lvl 10 easily from just the easy puzzles and multis
 procamania: how to debug?
 procamania: how to debug
 volkarion: Anyone help me understand something in BrainFuck?
 kevmok: how to debug?
 JBM: how to debug?
 heff: how to debug?
 PumaLeap: volkarion what is the question
 Schwase: sigh, i overcomplicated the optimal urinal problem
 Schwase: like
 Schwase: A LOT
 Schwase: i iterated every position and used an arraylist to split parent gaps to children
 Schwase: just figured out i can just use recursion to calculate each gap number of people
 Schwase: and iterate those combinations
 Martnart: Anyone knows why frames on this website are so buggy for me? I wanted to post something and the message button is scaled outside of my screen. Whenever i resize it automatically gets pushed out again, very annoying.
 Martnart: I can maximize the message window. But that still only gives me the text fields and no button
 Zuabros: never seem that

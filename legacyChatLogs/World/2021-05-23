 Westicles: Oh, no it is the next update that does this
 nam4.nguyen: I heard that C++ is the best way for beginners to start problem solving
 nam4.nguyen: and it's not that hard when u get used to it
 nam4.nguyen: and prepare beforehand programs
 BlackDereker: I think Python is one of the most beginner friendly
 BlackDereker: you don't have to care about strong typing, pointers and memory management
 BlackDereker: and Python have a lot of builting functions and libraries
 BlackDereker: builtin*
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup. Best way to not learn how not to think, and believe you can code without any comprehension of the 'behind'...
 BlaiseEbuth: There's one 'not' too many in this sentence... :thinking:
 circular17: VB.NET is the best for beginners, things are explicit like Property Function New etc. 
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 circular17: Though for clash of code, Ruby is the best :p
 IT8: @cicular17 same; ruby is most time much more efficient
 BlaiseEbuth: Bad languages are good to do bad activities... Logic.
 nam4.nguyen: Undeniable python is so friendly. But in case of problem-solving, those thing like strong typing or pointer is not that difficult
 nam4.nguyen: and I like strong typing cause I can easily control what I'm working with
 BlackDereker: python have hint typing
 JohnCM: is ruby faster than python, or about the same
 JohnCM: faster as in run-time
 IT8: with the new JIT in 3.0 it could be faster than python
 JohnCM: i wish i could write python code but still have c++ speed
 JohnCM: i now have to convert python code into c++ for runtime efficiency
 IT8: isn't there a project that compiles python to c++-ish code?
 Miki09: cython
 Miki09: it combinates python and different versions of c
 circular17: python is convenient for simple problems, but when it gets more complicated, I find it not great to structure things
 circular17: there are two characters to put at the end of a line in a text file&#160;: #13 and #10. The C language added to that ";"
 Ilovepypypy: hello
 idan_idan: in C:why sprintf not working good?
 DaNinja: it works fine for me
 SABZZ_: for some reason when i hit enter it does not let me write in a new line. i have to restart the browser to solve this. any ideas what is causing this trouble?
 jacek: sounds weird
 Marchete: happy sunday coding :keyboard:
 circular17: thanks you too&#160;:)
 hypers: cheers, @Marchete, same to you
 zonbita: why my language from profile not have c++?
 Moldy_Lunch_Box: guys im new to this site i need some help navigating through it. i saw my friends playing a coding game on here, they were in a room of like 8 other people competing to see who will finish writing the code faster before the time runs out. how do i get to it?
 IT8: thats clash of code; you should get access to it when you follow the intruduction path on the homepage

 IT8: maybe one with a CPU?
 IT8: jokes aside: what do you want to program on it?
 Manchi_o6o7: I need an all around laptop, for university etc.

 StevensGino: I am learning Rust, where should I learn it?
 StevensGino: any suggestions?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: In an Iron factory?
 jacek: oO
 StevensGino:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: google
 Greg_3141: Rust has a beginner's manual, you can read it

 StevensGino: thanks
 Greg_3141: imo it's easier to learn if you already know some C/C++
 Wontonimo: all hail the newest "Grand Master"
 Wontonimo: (by a thread)
 AntiSquid: jumped to #121 in totoro by adding an extra if, i feel so much smarter now
 Greg_3141: also be aware that idiomatic Rust uses a lot of iterators and closures
 AntiSquid: that game is pure skill and tests the intellect 
 Wontonimo: +1 AntiSquid

 AntiSquid: well if i tell you that my eval is quite random anyway, would you still care what that 1 if was&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 AntiSquid: it's for search priority between action types given certain count of trees
 AntiSquid: :D
 StevensGino: I know c++ and Java, so I should be ok with Rust
 AntiSquid: i feel like i wasted my time searching for random shit like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo 500, good job
 AntiSquid: gj

 justchris: hi, can someone help me understand what readline() in Javascript is?
 jacek: it reads from input. if it is console application you could write something and readline() would read it
 StevensGino: Hi Wontonimo, I just noticed you are the new grand master
 jacek: :tada:
 AntiSquid: look, there's an active D-lang bot on totoro
 BlaiseEbuth: YÃ©! Party! :tada:
 BlaiseEbuth: What are we celebrating?
 AntiSquid: also arukuka is D legend
 AntiSquid: BlaiseEbuth, wonto got to GM level on this site
 BlaiseEbuth: Only gm? Fix it! Use my starter and go guru! ezpz
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i think it's great when the 5% are active
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: bubble-eyes doesn't get the reference
 BlaiseEbuth: What do you mean? 100% of the CG's users are active... :smirk:
 AllYourTrees: does anyone know what flags rust programs are compiled with?
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably the Hungarian one.
 BlaiseEbuth: :flag_hu:
 jacek: hungarian flag?
 jacek: what does it do
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't know. Ask dbdr
 Wontonimo: I'm celebrating my entry (and imminent exit) of "Grand Master" BlaiseEbuth .  Free virtual tacos for everyone&#160;!
 AntiSquid: make gulash out of the totoro critters
 AntiSquid: makes *
 BlaiseEbuth: Why imminent exit? Fix it!
 jacek: hmm nothing in the faq about flags <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Wontonimo: i'm 500th, by tonight I'll be out because of CoC decay and other similar things.  Got no time to do anything about it for the next couple days.  But, "I'll be back"
 AllYourTrees: is there any way we can submit a PR with some flags or something?
 Wontonimo: PR?
 AllYourTrees: pull request on like github or something
 BlaiseEbuth: na
 Wontonimo: not for CG stuff, but definitely for the community git pages
 Wontonimo: it's there a way to add compiler hints at the top of your rust file like there is in c++&#160;?
 jacek: #pragma?
 Wontonimo: yeah, like that
 jacek: does rust need it tho?
 Wontonimo: AllYourSaplings was asking 
 AllYourTrees: there is a #[target_feature()] thing that im looking into now
 AllYourTrees: like there's one for popcnt
 AllYourTrees: and leading zero count
 AllYourTrees: idk if it makes a difference though lol
 AllYourTrees: there's also flags for the compiler that may enable them by default?
 AllYourTrees: thats why i was wondering
 Wontonimo: cool, share your findings if you discover something concrete 
 Wontonimo: :wave: bye
 AllYourTrees: :wave:
 AllYourTrees: do the CG machines support AVX/SSE instructions?
 jacek: yes
 AllYourTrees: ty
 BlaiseEbuth: Or perhaps the flag is the Czech one :flag_cz:, and so you have to use #Praguema

 AntiSquid: did you know the author of berserk manga died?
 jacek: slowpoke
 philRG: hello, I am playing on dice-duel puzzle (still in wood 2), did anyone notice any slowness in the gpu rendering engine?
 AntiSquid: i brought it up late in chat, knew days ago, you didn't mention it at all jace
 jacek: philRG dice duel is resource hungry anyway
 jacek: yes i did
 AntiSquid: i feel a slight slowness on a good pc :D philipplenk
 AntiSquid: philRG
 AntiSquid: sorry philipplenk pinged wrong guy
 philRG: ah ok well my hardware is pretty old (2011) 
 jacek: mine is 2020/2021...
 philRG: and it is an IMac
 jacek: :scream:
 AntiSquid: does it smell crispy at all&#160;?
 philRG: that's bad?&#160;:-D
 philRG: anyway, funny puzzle
 jacek: i need to find a way to do efficient move generation
 AntiSquid: use efficient net
 philRG: no strange odor yet, but i burnt a video card some months ago in a facetime session, so I need to watch out
 AntiSquid: if it's your own house you live in buy new pc, if you rent then maybe it's not so bad&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dice duel is slow AF for me too, I gave browser higher priority and it does better... but only a little.  The more Plays you do the more the JS seems to eat cycles.  My graphics card may be interfering with its "web helper", but I'm starting to doubt it.
 jacek: or euler put there crypto miner :imp:
 philRG: ah good idea, just need to figure out how to increase process priority in macOS thks for the tip&#160;:-)
 philRG: i have tested on safari/firefox/chrome, same result
 philRG: jacek hehe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I doubt my card can mine... but I have like 4 other pcs running if you wanna give them a go
 philRG: no thks i work locally in my ide, just for testing is difficult, but anyway, the gameplay is basic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I downloaded the three.js whatever it's called engine... i think it needs some tweaking.  i think the corner rounding for the dice is a bit overkill
 philRG: i can deal with that
 AntiSquid: did you try to zoom out? the table disappears at some point if you don't stop :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and the background rendering is like cool and all, but if setting are set to SD instead of HD, then it's should probably get turned off
 philRG: it is not worse than the cg editor, the text regularly decrease by 800% while I use keyboard and mouse simultaneously
 philRG: it is why I quit that
 philRG: did not notice any improvement when moving to SD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i do get the fact euler is using other peoples renders, maybe someone can render some lower detail versions
 jacek: he tried changing dices so the sides sum to 7, but he was unable to
 AntiSquid: 10 / 10 legend hype&#160;!! Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i don't know where they are
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it takes too long to test code multiple times in ide ... so I'm probably stuck in wood2 cause it takes sooo long to test
 AntiSquid: setup offline then
 AntiSquid: ah fk loss
 AntiSquid: by 1 sun&#160;!!!
 AntiSquid: 1 sun Automaton2020
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I hardcoded the dice, so I'm ok with the 'innacurate' not RW dice
 AntiSquid: does the ruleset of the game seem fun?
 AntiSquid: didn't properly read it
 AntiSquid: winstreak in ruins Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but they don't need to do a bfs from each node
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's like 100+ moves possible each turn
 AntiSquid: uhm, ok
 BlaiseEbuth: Duct+NN legend ezpz
 AntiSquid: i use skill thanks
 reCurse: kekw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm  doing puzzles atm, dice is ok i guess.  I am glad the possmove list isn't given in input...that weeds out the lazy peepz
 AntiSquid: that list is only recommended where the number of moves is 20 or less afaik
 reCurse: Oh wow euler showing off 3d skills
 reCurse: Nice
 AntiSquid: Quake 3 arena next right&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, gotta run a shower surround thru my table saw ... glhf
 struct: he also ported <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/blockout">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/blockout</a>
 reCurse: No debug view though&#160;:'(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid :joy:
 struct: But its a little less polished imo
 struct: He had some problems with renders and such
 reCurse: Sensitivity is also too damn high
 VIPE: hwllow, world
 reCurse: I think he needs to reduce fov a bit
 reCurse: Too much perspective
 jacek: less polished? why he didnt asked me about it
 reCurse: I have no idea why but I want to see isometric on CG now
 AntiSquid: Jagged Alliance port
 reCurse: Also you're welcome jacek
 zonbita: how to up to 15 th
 jacek: hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: Be 16th first, then do better.
 jacek: oh karliso down a bit
 struct: oh you got 1st again, grats
 AntiSquid: which game
 struct: uttt
 jacek: reBless favourite
 jacek: he spends so much time on it
 reCurse: Maybe this time I can forget it exists
 jacek: you did something to address the imbalance?
 reCurse: 12h more training mostly
 jacek: so you just put more hardware into it
 reCurse: And gave a bit more thinking time to p2
 AntiSquid: train on replays?
 reCurse: Nope
 AntiSquid: why not&#160;? for p2
 reCurse: I don't know why but training on CG replays feels wrong to me
 jacek: sounds too booky for you
 AntiSquid: it's a dataset 
 reCurse: Trying to formulate it better
 reCurse: The way I see it
 reCurse: CG acts as a validation dataset
 reCurse: So leaking it into training corrupts that
 struct: how much of an advantage does p1 have?
 struct: &gt;=0.6?
 reCurse: Um
 jacek: in my training phase about 75% winrate
 jacek: (draw is half win)
 reCurse: After first turn middle gives 58.7%
 reCurse: Which feels wrong
 reCurse: But shrug
 Wontonimo: i was thinking of your comments about SC2021 reCurse, and how your bot had trouble with the lower levels.  It's as if it training mostly against other really good players and developed a blind spot for random plays.
 jacek: after few iterations it increases <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/PvPr6zp.png">https://i.imgur.com/PvPr6zp.png</a>
 AntiSquid: if p1 has advantage then it should always win once the NN is fully trained
 reCurse: The problem is measuring that is very difficult
 reCurse: Because if you let it go like that
 reCurse: Winrates are always 100 or 0
 Wontonimo: It made me think of my Son's experience with fencing, he got to top 20 in Canada for his age group, but still has a hard time with noobs
 reCurse: Wontonimo: Well it's a bit like that, except it develops no policy for bad play
 struct: is it not possible to take into account score difference?
 reCurse: I'm starting to have better ideas now that I see how it works in uttt
 reCurse: Score difference is a crutch
 reCurse: There are games where you have no such thing
 Wontonimo: it also made me think of overfitting.  If in the training process a bot it doesn't training vs bad bots, it won't have a policy for it
 AntiSquid: +
 Wontonimo: but then you are using part of your limited resource to battle noobs
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: There needs to be a secondary signal for winning more I think
 reCurse: Whatever that means
 jacek: do not train policy then [solved]
 reCurse: jacek: Any bot has a policy, get over it
 jacek: is generating moves policy?
 reCurse: The move you play in a given state is a policy
 jacek: i thought policy as output from NN
 reCurse: That's one kind of policy
 reCurse: NN can output the policy directly, so you just sample the NN and output the move
 reCurse: That's typically model-free learning
 reCurse: But if you do a minimax search, what you decide to play is *also* a policy
 reCurse: It's a much broader word
 Wontonimo: any heuristic for selecting move is a policy.  any heuristic that evaluates a board is a value.
 reCurse: I disagree with the second statement
 Wontonimo: tell me
 reCurse: There are heuristic which compare states and output '&lt;'
 reCurse: It's an interesting idea actually
 daffie: u guys, I am still learning and want to ask re the spring challenge, what was the optimal type of AI to use?
 Wontonimo: that can give  more sensitivity for sure
 reCurse: Being stuck in a single dimension for value could be a problem
 struct: daffie <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849</a>
 daffie: wow thanks
 jacek: daffie many people used beam search or duct mcts. some people used good old heuristics (ifs)
 AntiSquid: strong ifs daffie
 AntiSquid: most optimal
 AntiSquid: time investment / return
 Wontonimo: the 2 boards "&gt;" is interesting, because you can do a lot of supervised training given previous plays and how two board configurations led to win or lose.
 CraftCatPython: .;l
 reCurse: The problem with it is I'm not sure how to use in a search
 reCurse: Minimax sure
 reCurse: MCTS though...
 reCurse: Maybe there's some form of embedding you can use for averaging
 reCurse: And it learns to use it as such
 reCurse: Probably gibberish though
 Wontonimo: best_board = 1st next possible movefor rest possible next boards:
 reCurse: MCTS is based on average of reward
 reCurse: Average of comparison is not making much sense
 Wontonimo: how about this...
 AntiSquid: .. Automaton2000 ..
 Automaton2000: he has a good bot
 Wontonimo: best_board_value = 1st - previous_boardfor rest possible next boards:
 reCurse: Doesn't quite work for MCTS
 Wontonimo: calculating the improvement from previous.
 reCurse: Minimax is fine though
 Wontonimo: right
 reCurse: Because it doesn't need value just comparisons
 reCurse: Well except if you get fancy with window searchs and whatever
 Wontonimo: how about for plain UCT?  Hypothetically
 Wontonimo: no, nvm
 reCurse: It needs a confidence bound, which is still based on a scalar
 Wontonimo: yeah, and unless somehow your "&gt;" is additive so that a+b = (a-c) + (a-c) you couldn't add the terms depthwise in the tree
 Wontonimo: sorry&#160;: a+b = (a-c) + (b-c)
 Wontonimo: second mistake.  "&gt;" is only subtraction, so&#160;: a-b == (a-c) - (c-b)
 MSmits: hey Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: it you could make the NN do that (which I would highly doubt) then you could use the addition of all previous parent-child evals to replace just straight board value.  Long winded way of saying I agree with you
 MSmits: I tried the negative xor thing with -1,0,1 input instead of a one hot version, both worked
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 MSmits: this: inputs = [[0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,0], [1,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,1,1]]targets = [0,1,1,0,1,1,0]
 MSmits: vs: 
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: inputs = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [-1,-1], [-1,0], [0,-1]]targets = [0,1,1,0,0,1,1]
 Wontonimo: Great.  Yeah, I first reported it wouldn't work, but then sent you that code where I fixed the init weights to also be negative and found that it did work.
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Wontonimo: great work doing it
 jacek: you had non negaitve weights only? :scream:
 Wontonimo: what did you use MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: i just used python, adapted from basic xor example
 jacek: with momentum?
 MSmits: it's just a matter of changing input and target
 MSmits: well i did that too, because you wrote it for mr
 MSmits: me
 MSmits: I also changed the input -&gt; hidden to relu
 MSmits: worked better than sigmoid
 jacek: in my experience relu in xor example is more sensitive to init weights. it more often diverges
 MSmits: oh thats possible, i might not have tested enough
 MSmits: I am currently trying to write a simple TTT implementation to get input and targets from
 MSmits: I was thinking of doing a 1 ply minimax and try to match the 1 ply value to 0 ply value in self-play
 Wontonimo: oh, I'm looking forward to seeing you release NNs MSmits&#160;!
 MSmits: kind of what you do with oware, with your 200 rollouts
 jacek: so... temporal difference?
 MSmits: is that what that is? I am doing it like the xor example only with different input and targets
 jacek: for oware at first i used 8-plies search values of negamax bot as data
 MSmits: hmm but that's supervised right
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: i am gonna try doing it with the NN
 MSmits: so at first its prediction will be crap
 Wontonimo: +1 for supervised jacek
 MSmits: except the last moves, which will have perfect prediction (due to W/L/D)
 MSmits: then it should work its way backwards to good openings with enough iterations
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: thats the plan anyways, maybe it will need more bells and whistles than the basic xor
 Wontonimo: just a few hehe
 MSmits: i'll use your momentum thingy, it's easy enough
 MSmits: what do you think would be lacking from xor example Wontonimo?
 jacek: more hidden units/layers maybe
 Wontonimo: more inputs, more outputs, more layers
 MSmits: why  more layers for TTT? jacek only uses 1 hidden for oware 
 jagadeshm: Hi
 Wontonimo: you'll find that training time increases geometrically with each layer you add.
 MSmits: yeah, i already saw that from tensorflow playground
 jacek: ohai jagadeshm
 Wontonimo: i have a video about addressing that&#160;;)
 MSmits: cool i might watch that
 MSmits: I am thinking of experimenting with TTT though
 MSmits: once it works
 AntiSquid: wonto advert inc
 MSmits: see what kind of configuration trains fastest, or what the simplest possible network is that can play perfectly
 reCurse: I'm trying to picture search in OOC and my brain hurts
 Wontonimo: i take it all back, go with what you have and the simplest model you can think of first.  That becomes your baseline.

 Wontonimo: yeah, 400 layers, it trained fast.
 Wontonimo: it uses good init weights and resnet-in-resnet
 jacek: would you post that in memes?
 1415495: reCurse: not sure what you want to achieve, but sometimes in some papers instead of predicting the score the predict it's distribution (but I don't see a use for winrate, unless you have a way to be in&#160;!= conditions)
 reCurse: Not sure what I want to achieve either, just rambling&#160;:)
 struct: How do chess NNs handle it?
 reCurse: Single value
 jacek: which chess NNs?
 jacek: lc0 is alphazero and nnue is value network
 1415495: there is also the possibility to use exploration (via curiosity) to try to uncover more policy space
 1415495: the difficulty with MCTS is that exploration will biases the values
 reCurse: I tried intrinsic reward in csb, couldn't get it to work well
 reCurse: It's super weird stuff in an already weird field
 AntiSquid: do BotG with NN, it's your destiny
 1415495: but curiosity is not too difficult to use (like with a constant random initialized NN and try to lear its output on the board state, the more error the less seen)
 reCurse: Yeah but then you get the TV problem
 MSmits: seems to me like a main problem with NN is that you have so many options to tweak you tend to try too much at once and miss the optimal configuration of your network
 1415495: yes but in deterministic game you won't have the issue&#160;;)
 reCurse: Sure but it makes me uneasy
 1415495: MSmits: so true (at least for me)
 reCurse: That means there are very glaring weaknesses
 AntiSquid: you can train it in epochs and fine tune params 
 AntiSquid: MSmits
 MSmits: yea but i dont just mean params
 reCurse: MSmits Random search outperforming grid search seems to indicate you can't really try too much stuff at once
 NguyenNC: :joy:
 MSmits: i mean what activation to use, optimizer etc.
 jacek: and what data to feed
 MSmits: you mean randomly combining stuff for your network and see what works?
 reCurse: Randomly tuning stuff
 AntiSquid: ya you can automate that too
 MSmits: tuning includes how many layers, what activation to use, how many nodes per layer  etc.?
 jacek: neat
 reCurse: See your original comment
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: I say it's not a bad thing
 reCurse: See random search vs grid search
 reCurse: Random search is wayyyy better
 reCurse: The more dimensions you have
 MSmits: well grid becomes impossible soon enough
 reCurse: And it's actually hard to beat
 MSmits: how about GA and such?
 MSmits: people seem to use that
 reCurse: I remember reading a nice paper explaining this
 jacek: im at this point where i tweak what data to put into network. should they come from more semi-random games? or use deeper search as targets? or something else
 MSmits: oh right, your 200 rollout parameter
 AntiSquid: why not both jacek&#160;?
 1415495: for the power of random: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/">https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/</a>
 jacek: or both
 AntiSquid: i mean why is data augmentation even a thing otherwise? @_@
 reCurse: I'm still not buying this neuroevolution thing

 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/rebel-a-general-game-playing-ai-bot-that-excels-at-poker-and-more/">https://ai.facebook.com/blog/rebel-a-general-game-playing-ai-bot-that-excels-at-poker-and-more/</a>
 reCurse: Mentioned it before about what
 MSmits: reCurse	did you watch that video about exploiting opponent mistakes? I seemed a lot like what you were looking for
 MSmits: that 1 hr video
 reCurse: Still have the tab open, will get to it eventually
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: you never close your tabs?
 reCurse: It's similar to garbage collection
 reCurse: After a certain threshold I close them
 reCurse: Some of them
 AntiSquid: random games
 1415495: I usually lose them when I reinstall my PC, otherwise ...&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: what vid MSmits&#160;?
 AntiSquid: not sure i watched it or not @_@
 MSmits: have to find the link, but reCurse has it open so...
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/computing-mistake-exploiting-strategies-in-very-large-zero-sum-games/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/computing-mistake-exploiting-strategies-in-very-large-zero-sum-games/</a>
 AntiSquid: bookmark &gt; export &gt; save to cloud or whatever
 reCurse: I'm starting to get comfortable with the idea of simulating horizons though
 reCurse: Not sure if that's what they're doing
 MSmits: didnt watch the whole thing yet, but the problem description is equal to yours
 reCurse: Yeah thanks
 MSmits: what do you do if the full search tells you every move is a loss
 jacek: choose longest loss
 reCurse: No that's garbage imo
 MSmits: well we had that discussion yesterday, better to see how the researchers handle it. Longest loss may be good for some games, but it's not a general solution
 jacek: or loss with most traps but thats hard to quantify
 reCurse: If the traps are super obvious like a guaranteed exchange in chess it fails as well
 reCurse: There is a probabilistic notion in there
 MSmits: yavalath has many obvious traps and many non-obvious traps (like 10 plies deep)
 reCurse: I really like the idea of grading 0 to perfection as an horizon over a solved game
 therealbeef: losses where the opponent has as 'narrow' a path as possible
 reCurse: The narrowness of the path does not indicate whether it's easy to find or not
 reCurse: Nor does the depth
 MSmits: depends on the algorithm the opponent is using
 MSmits: with minimax, the depth might be a serious issue
 reCurse: Sure but in the context of a guided MCTS
 MSmits: yeah ok
 reCurse: Then it seems it should work very well
 reCurse: Thinking time should correlate a lot with strength
 MSmits: should yeah
 reCurse: Where as the curve is a lot less nice in minimax
 MSmits: well it's not smooth in any case
 MSmits: because of the iterations
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: The trap can be defined as something only found after a certain thinking time and not before
 MSmits: I think this kind of experimentation is kind of fun. Doing benchmarks to see the effect of more calculation time and such. I never get around to doing that
 reCurse: So that's how you swindle a loss in a victory
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but how do you teach your bot to make use of that 
 MSmits: seems complicated
 reCurse: Hmm, am I saying too much now
 reCurse:&#160;:)
 therealbeef: if a path is very narrow, it's indeed more likely that the opponent finds the one move that stands out. so there should be multiple moves that are nearly indistinguishable and lead to different outcomes
 MSmits: well not to me, it's doubtful i will be making use of that, but who knows who else is watching&#160;:)
 MSmits: therealbeef when solving states with meta mcts, the hardest to solve are often the ones where I have 8 moves that all have near 100% WR. As opposed to just 1 good one
 MSmits: you'd be exploring them all and look much less deep
 reCurse: Well I did get the idea right when I said "you learn more easily from situations of balance than imbalance" on the forum I guess
 MSmits: makes sense, because when there is imbalance, you can win with bad moves
 MSmits: and you get rewarded for those
 kovi: karlios down to #4 uttt?
 MSmits: ohh, really
 kovi: recurse succeeded with relu?
 reCurse: Overnight training
 MSmits: this could just be recurses old bot, it would also wreck karliso wouldnt it?
 reCurse: It just needed a bit more heat to figure it out
 MSmits: will it stay on top after later submits?
 reCurse: Hope so
 reCurse: Can't run batches anymore
 MSmits: karliso's bot is very good at wrecking all the weaker bots
 MSmits: yeah hard to say without benchmark
 MSmits: in a way you're in luck, as a NN player
 MSmits: at least you train by selfplay
 reCurse: I thought the same thing during contest :P
 MSmits: i used to fit params with cg benchmark
 jacek: i never used cg benchmark and whatnot. everything i do is locally
 MSmits: I used it with a lot of succes in oware, but much less in other games
 MSmits: somehow param fits helped a lot
 MSmits: (also over fitting vs Nn, but not exclusively that)
 MSmits: looking forward to getting to a situation where i can just do self-play like you guys
 jacek: you have wife, no need for self-play
 MSmits: i knew that was coming&#160;:)
 reCurse: There's an easy boomer joke to make here
 AntiSquid: dirty minds think alike&#160;?
 reCurse: What's a good way to do search in OOC?
 reCurse: Seems like there's way too many actions and possible states
 AntiSquid: see postmortems :P
 AntiSquid: well totoro is easier in that regard i guess
 reCurse: I've been reading through them but
 reCurse: Maybe I missed something
 reCurse: It's more about using pure heuristics to remove possibilities than using a search algorithm
 AntiSquid: some people never got to the search part true
 struct: some people used mcts
 MSmits: reCurse we kept track of all possible places the opponent could be. Basically brute force. Then there are various ways to pick a path to minimize the probability of hitting a mine
 MSmits: i used beamsearch for this
 MSmits: but there's many ways to do this
 MSmits: then there were a bunch of heuristics used for determining when to place mines, when to shoot etc.
 MSmits: so it's a combination of things
 MSmits: not 1 search
 reCurse: I'm trying to see how to make it fit in a search
 MSmits: you might want to try picking one aspect of the game and use a NN for this
 MSmits: instead of using NN for the full game
 reCurse:&#160;:/
 MSmits: thats also a serious undertaking imho.... 
 MSmits: and something that is done in real life
 reCurse: Maybe, it's possible I'm just toying with the idea
 AntiSquid: what approach are you intending for OOC&#160;? (ML)
 reCurse: I have no idea I'm still trying to see how to build a search around it
 reCurse: Stuff like should you have a branch for each possible state, then play MOVE L on it
 reCurse: Or play MOVE L on the entire set of possibilities
 reCurse: It's a bit weird
 MSmits: we did something like that yes
 MSmits: not sure if those two are different
 reCurse: The good old is it X or Y? Yes
 AntiSquid: "The logic is split into two states, one for when the enemy position is known and one where it's still unknown."  check my PM i think it has good info
 reCurse: Ok
 reCurse: Oh wait I'm dumb you don't need to split possibilities at each ply
 MSmits: and make sure you use *all* available information, there are some little things that are easy to miss
 reCurse: You 'only' need to split possibilities at the root
 jrke: and when opponent use silence
 MSmits: yeah, it splits once per turn
 jrke: i am also working on OOC
 reCurse: Yeah but silence can be part of the regular tree
 reCurse: Unknowns are only at the root
 reCurse: Yay
 reCurse: Progress
 MSmits: silence is a real brancher
 MSmits: other stuff is easy to manage
 MSmits: if an opponent spams silence, you may need to prune intelligently or you may timeout
 MSmits: but full silence spam is not the best tactic anyways
 jrke: even you can use torpedo as cutting off some possibilities where opponent can be
 reCurse: Yeah but I am suddenly happier that the tree is only N possible spots bigger
 reCurse: Instead of something like a card game when you draw unknowns possibly all the time
 MSmits: jrke and thereby giving away your position&#160;:)
 MSmits: reCurse yeah it is manageable
 struct: I wanted to try ooc but I have no idea how to bitboard it
 reCurse: Ok this is very reassuring, not sure why I was stuck on that
 struct: is too large for me
 ZarthaxX: just dont? :P
 MSmits: the funny thing is, that even if the opponent explodes a mine, you can use the information to discern that way back when he must have placed that mine, he had to be near there
 AntiSquid: jrke sure but torpedos give your position away very fast too 
 MSmits: and eliminate positions that way
 jrke: hmm
 AntiSquid: that's why some folks only used mines instead :D
 reCurse: Oh no mines multiply the at root
 reCurse: *at the
 MSmits: silence is worse than mines really, but just try it reCurse, you'll code this stuff quickly enough
 AntiSquid: not just that, mines can be placed from 4 possible directions :D
 reCurse: Silence shouldn't be scary though
 reCurse: It overlaps positions
 MSmits: it's not hard to code, it's just very branchy
 struct: pb4 had a bot made to explode states
 MSmits: and yeah it does overlap, true
 struct: iirc
 reCurse: I was fine with number of positions being at the root
 reCurse: But multiply that number with mines and ugh
 MSmits: it's probably necessary to hash states
 reCurse: Oh and paths too... I should really think more and speak less
 MSmits: everyone went through this during contest. I remember beating gold boss because i implemented mine tracking and avoidance
 MSmits: maybe you should just code a normal bot for it and then see what part of it (if at all) to use a nn for
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: No it needs to be grouped
 reCurse: There are only 3 outcomes to a torpedo, no sense applying that to all positions
 reCurse: Back to the drawing board
 AntiSquid: just rechecked, i am sure you need 2 NNs 
 MSmits: btw, when the opponent lays down a mine, you can 4 states from each state for each of the 4 neighbors, or you can keep track of how many mines were laid from each position, thereby only incrementing a number by 1
 MSmits: it's a lot more efficient in terms of state explosion
 reCurse: But you need to take a probability into account when you go on that square
 MSmits: yeah,  check each neighbor
 reCurse: Not sure how to implement that
 MSmits: see how many mines were laid from there
 MSmits: calc probability from that somehow
 reCurse: Like say you're on a square with mine
 reCurse: There needs to be an environment branch somewhere
 reCurse: With probability
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: as long as all the information is in the state, that should be doable
 AntiSquid: you could assume the opponent took the path with the highest branching (or one of the paths with high branching)
 MSmits: oh, i guess you need to look at all states
 MSmits: yeah that could be painful
 reCurse: I get the impression information needs to be aggregated
 jacek: use muzero, ezpz
 reCurse: Handling individual possibilities is too much
 AntiSquid: yes you merge states when you can
 reCurse: Paths really make this complicated though
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: that's part of what made this a good contest, figuring this stuff out
 MSmits: it was a month long too
 VizGhar: What is easier Vox Codei 2 or Mars Lander 3?
 MSmits: (like locam)
 AntiSquid: you sound like difficulty boosts quality 
 reCurse: If I get started on this (still only at the stage of toying with the idea), I think I have no choice but to start with a simplified version
 struct: They are completely different games VizGhar
 reCurse: To make it work with learning
 reCurse: Too much branching everywhere
 reCurse: And work from there
 AntiSquid: what do you think of my idea&#160;?
 reCurse: I guess it's fine but I have a hard time picturing the implementation
 MSmits: AntiSquid mmh you're right, for starting players ooc was too hard.  I just think the problems to be solved were interesting
 reCurse: The other idea is to learn a model instead with muzero like jacek said
 reCurse: But multiple networks and only 50ms, kill me now
 MSmits: afk a bit, digging holes in my backyard
 jacek: i was trolling
 MSmits: (no jacek, i didnt kill anyone)
 reCurse: With less constraints though it could work
 reCurse: Maybe
 AntiSquid: you do it offline and there's a way to remove time limit from game locally
 reCurse: Sure but without arena opponents it sucks
 jacek: then ask others for their code
 Illedan: Oh, didn't hear about Muzero before. Thx

 Greg_3141: it seems like you can get to gold league in some games (coders strike back, the great escape) just by slapping a bot together
 SEXYHUSKY: hello 
 SEXYHUSKY: :P
 jacek: slapping?
 Greg_3141: what I mean is that the standard is not nearly as high as one would expect
 Greg_3141: in the great escape, for example, iirc even in silver league you would get opponents that would make an illegal move and die
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth slaps Automaton2000 with AutomatonNN to reach gold league.</b></p><p><img src="/a/40502662118268" /> Automaton2000: so i have an idea of what you do with the game
 AntiSquid: ya that's why they're still in silver
 jacek: imo at silver level they shouldnt make illegal moves and just be weak
 BlaiseEbuth: Or old bots killed by a language update...
 jacek: kotlin bots?
 struct: And a few more languages
 Greg_3141: a search tree with depth 1 is enough to get to gold league in "the great escape"
 BlaiseEbuth: Kotlin bots are stillborn...
 AntiSquid: the older the game the weaker the bots

 NeAlyssa: hello, didnt really wanna interrupt u but as i see here is a lot of "old users" of this site so may I ask u for some recommendations, which bot programming game is the most interesting and not really hard to learn in ur opinion? just wondering
 therealbeef: ultimate tic tac toe&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: botters of the galaxy NeAlyssa
 AntiSquid: not ultimate tic tac toe, unless you want to suffer
 Wontonimo: hey, i played BotG yesterday (or was it this morning, can't keep track of time anymore cuz covid)  I moved a rank from following advice in discussion
 AntiSquid: do you know any programming language NeAlyssa&#160;?
 therealbeef: UTTT has simple rules and game representation, and is interestingly complex
 Wontonimo: (no, i don't have covid.  it's just that every day is like a groundhog day)
 Doggolover245: I wonder when I get out of hospital
 Doggolover245: maybe tommorow
 NeAlyssa: I know python, c++ and a little C#(we study it i university now) but I used them only for problem solving(like codeforces and different informatics olympiads), cant do anything useful with them

 Wontonimo: the graphics are nice.  and i love space, so there is that
 jacek: dont forget the wonderful sounds
 AntiSquid: ya that's fair, hard for me to judge what they'll like
 Wontonimo: oh geez, yeah, sorry.  Forgot to mention, it is loud.

 thomasgonda3: for certain games when it says you get like 50ms per turn or whatever, does it start timing you for the next turn as soon as you console log the input for the current turn?
 Weird-person: ok
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid :D
 Weird-person: ...
 Weird-person: this is cool
 jacek: thomasgonda3 start measure time after first input during loop
 Weird-person: wheres my profile pic
 AntiSquid: F5
 AntiSquid: "Weird-person 10:15PMwheres my profile pic"
 thomasgonda3: so i can run code after i console.log my next input but before the while loop repeats and it wont count as part of the next turn's time?
 AntiSquid: you could check how i do it in my starter&#160;? :P
 Weird-person: ...
 AntiSquid: Weird-person has been banned by AntiSquid.
 thomasgonda3: im talking about for search race specifically but for mars lander as well i suppose
 AntiSquid: it's the same in all games
 thomasgonda3: yeah
 thomasgonda3: i just built a ga for the first time a few days ago and im using the same thing pretty much for both games.  My problem is I keep timing out unexpectedly even if i set the time limit for the ga way below the time limit for that turn
 thomasgonda3: i need to set my gas time limit to be like 15 ms max to be safe
 AntiSquid: depends also what computations you do inbetween the time check and how you break out of the loop
 kresteodymium: hi AntiSquid
 kresteodymium: hi thomasgonda3
 jacek: for search race (and other optims) there is bug with timeouts
 jacek: and people use &lt;35ms
 AntiSquid: oh really? that explains my search race timeouts -.-#
 thomasgonda3: i mean im doing some sorting and some computations but its hard to believe that one ga can take like 30 ms when my average ga turn takes like .01-.02
 thomasgonda3: i have the same thing happen to me on mars lander but i can set the time limit much higher than 15ms
 AntiSquid: check loops and such
 AntiSquid: i don't know
 thomasgonda3: ok
 AntiSquid: search race is buggy for me too
 AntiSquid: ah you also need to get all check points within a turn limit or you get timeout, is that what you mean&#160;?
 thomasgonda3: it would be fine if there was only a few tests and you could just get lucky but theres like 60 tests when you submit it lol
 thomasgonda3: for search race

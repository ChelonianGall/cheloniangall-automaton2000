 Justin-Truong: code royal hard
 Demurator: im stuck on coders strike back lol
 Demurator: the 2nd level
 Demurator: i get errors
 LittleFlea: you may need to explain a little more.
 Demurator: probably
 Demurator: my code works, just the game says im not inputting it fast enough
 Demurator: im using python 3
 Demurator: "Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due "
 Demurator: even though i definitely did

 Demurator: no still doesnt work
 Demurator: sad
 Demurator: tahnks th0o
 martinpapa69: :thumbsup:
 Demurator: thanks tho*
 Demurator: apparently im not inputting fast enough
 Demurator: which is very confusing
 martinpapa69: when your code has a bug, and crashes, the, codingame will say also timeout. technically, you do timeout, because your code never gives an output, when it crashes
 Demurator: fair enough
 Demurator: i dont see an error :upside_down:

 Demurator: i have been on that for 2 hours and 40 minutes
 Demurator: i really need to sleep lol
 Demurator: i have been doing lua recently so i keep forgetting about colons
 Demurator: how do i move on to the next level lol

 Justin-Truong: what rank are you in coders strike back
 Demurator: wood 1
 Demurator: lol 
 Demurator: im trying to get into whatever is above it
 tekki: gl hf Demurator
 Demurator: huh
 Demurator: tekki?
 Demurator: how do u ping ppl
 eulerscheZahl: write their name

 Demurator: tekki
 Demurator: eulerscheZahl a
 eulerscheZahl: it's only red for that one person
 Demurator: ohhhhhhhhhhhh
 Demurator: Demurator a
 eulerscheZahl: open the chat in a 2nd tab. then you can ping yourself
 Demurator: how
 eulerscheZahl: just open the website twice
 Demurator: okay
 Demurator: Demurator
 tekki: hello world and Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but is it a good idea
 eulerscheZahl: i hate that bot
 tekki:&#160;:)
 tekki: why?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just spamming nonsense. cluttering the chat
 eulerscheZahl: i'm glad that at least AutomatonNN died
 Demurator: Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: because if the opponent is doing
 Demurator: wot
 eulerscheZahl: ping the bot, the bot will generate a random sentence
 Demurator: ohhh
 eulerscheZahl: "sentence"
 Demurator: Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: i know where to start on a bot to play the same opponent
 Demurator: oofd
 Demurator: oof
 Demurator: i can see why thats annoying
 SeraphWeddUltimate: clash today feels so slow... too many bots too little coders...
 Demurator: i tried that earlier but i suck lol
 Demurator: how do i move up a league in csb?
 martinpapa69: when you get on the top of your league, you get promoted to the next 1
 Demurator: its not happening
 Demurator: ive been rank 1 for ages
 Demurator: and ive been refreshing, im still rank 1 for me
 martinpapa69: are you even above the boss&#160;?
 Demurator: yes
 martinpapa69: you gotta wait then, it takes a bit of time to get promoted
 Demurator: i keep waiting but someone takes number 1 and i lose it
 martinpapa69: if the color of the boroder of your portrait gets the gold color, no1 can take your promotion
 Demurator: where's the border
 martinpapa69: I mean, you see your rank:1
 martinpapa69: there is a background color
 Demurator: i just beat the boss again but it isnt doing anything
 martinpapa69: it should be gold
 Demurator: its not
 ProCoder03: Demurator it still computing for you 
 Demurator: okay
 Demurator: what if someone takes number 1
 ProCoder03: its gonna take another 4-5 mins 
 LittleFlea: click on the last battle tab on the left of the screen and you will see the progress
 martinpapa69: multiple players can be promoted in the same time
 Demurator: ok
 martinpapa69: if you are above the boss after the computation finished, yo uget promoted
 LittleFlea: good to know
 Demurator: oh the battles are going slow
 ProCoder03: hmm, it seems you have submitted multiple times
 Demurator: im now rank 632
 LittleFlea: so in gold the number 1 is behind the boss.will it still be promoted
 ProCoder03: Nope
 ProCoder03: he needs to be more than boss
 LittleFlea: interesting
 Demurator: YAY IM IN BRONZE... FINALLLYYYYY
 Demurator: oh god... pods collide now????

 Kepe55: So should I practice with easy puzzles first and then go over to medium or try solving medium right away? I solved around 5 easy puzzles I think
 Kepe55: Im having a really hard time with the Folding a Note medium puzzle
 Kepe55: And I'm getting frustrated
 derjack: so medium puzzles can be easier than easy ones
 Kepe55: Really? I just started with the Folding a Note puzzle and I notice that it's really hard for me

 Kepe55: Someone suggested looking up the solution and learning it
 Kepe55: I think I'm gonna do that
 Kepe55: nvm I cant find a python solution to Folding a Note
 TimothyAlexisVass: Does destructuring assignments work here for JavaScript?

 jdsigg: TimothyAlexisVass, could you try sorting by parsing characters 1 by 1 in your sort function?
 jdsigg: For example, when you compare 'a5' and 'a15', you compare 'a' and 'a'. They are the same, move on, you compare '5' and '1'. 5 is bigger than one, so return the appropriately larger string 
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you at leasr earn money for posting those links Maxim251? 
 Astrobytes: I guess you might need a custom comparator function TimothyAlexisVass, I'm not JS expert but something like:var arr = ["br1", "1", "br15", "Dec125"];console.log(arr.sort(function (a, b) { return a &lt; b;}));

 Maxim251: #BlaiseEbuth No, how I can make money if movie is not my? I m looking for information about OOP because I am still learning that, and this video shock me. Everybody say that OOP is greate, Industry have standard of OOP, and I was looking for job in programing, and everybody in Netherlands require knowing OOP in C++ Python and Java. And this guy say, its wrong.
 Astrobytes: It's not 'wrong', but you'll find you often mix paradigms in real world situations as opposed to pure OOP or pure whatever
 Husoski: Maxim251 It's one guy, one opinion.  Don't get your shorts in a twist.  
 Maxim251: I just want start conversation about why not to use OOP
 Westicles: Right now companies are hiring anyone who can manage not to drool during the interview
 Husoski: Bjarne Stroustrup (C++ inventor, originally, before the committee took over) once said that he didn't see much advantage to C++ over C in a project under 100K source lines.
 Astrobytes: Use the right approach for the right parts, right tools for the right job etc
 Maxim251: In my case, 95% companies in Netherlands they want peoples whu work 3 years minimum. And for me as Junior developer is almost impossible to pas that requirements.
 BlaiseEbuth: Well I say java is bad, but it's one of the most used tech in industry. So, professionally speaking, are you gonna find a job or listen to me?
 Maxim251: Brian Will I think that he try show that, is not for everything. That OOP is overused. 
 BlaiseEbuth: as java is :smirk:
 Astrobytes: Bad design is bad design
 jdsigg: You can make a lot of convincing arguments for or against OOP, it all comes down to using the right tool for the job imo
 Maxim251: I am training in C++, that language I chouse to learn. Yes, its dificult, more then Java or Python. But I love electronics, and automatisation, and That was logical choice
 Astrobytes: Yeah, jdsigg, that's what I said earlier
 jdsigg: Tools age in and out, though. At my company, we have people writing Fortran because that's how it started and its not a priority to change 40k+ lines of a working product that customers like. 
 jdsigg: fist bump Astro
 Astrobytes: As I said before Maxim, don't get hung up on peoples opinions on youtube videos/the internet, and don't obsess over OOP or any other paradigm
 AllYourTrees: at a job unless you are building something from the ground up those kind of decisions have already been made for you lol
 Astrobytes: jdsigg: sometimes FORTRAN is what you really need too&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Working is for poor people anyway.
 Maxim251: When I start learning OOP, I see classes as the containers for storing data and related function for them. But when I come to point of inheritance and virtual functions, WOOO... I can do so much more, Exclude so much code from memory after creating class for one task... 
 Astrobytes: Sure, there are definitely things to be learned about encapsulation and all that
 Westicles: Fortran is fast.  If they had it here, all the swinging dicks would be using it for multis
 Astrobytes: lol, I thought you said they had the gnu fortran compiler Westicles? Or was that another lang?
 Westicles: oh, yeah you can get at it if you really want to
 Maxim251: Now is problem of not over complicate use of classes. As begginer I did that mistake, and whn at begginning coding gows so greate, lines of code flows like water in the river, and I reach the gold point where it change to disaster, where to much logic in one class breakes that flow. And was harder and harder to menage
 BlaiseEbuth: Fortran is present in base gcc iirc
 Astrobytes: Maxim251: Keep it simple
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines</a>
 Maxim251: Yes, I will try, but ike in last code in Codingame game, I try make one class for logic thinking that this aproach will be simple. But keeping all logick game in one place, was wrong decision, Thats why I start learning more about Inheritance and functional programing. Like strategy paterns in OOP
 Maxim251: I did desighn classes, ass, Quin, wariors, map in seperate classes, and of cource logic class... There I was lost, after adding more logic and more, step by step, I reach the point where I fail. now I am looking for a way to solve problem of simplify logic. To achieve complexity, but also to separate them.
 BlaiseEbuth: ass design :thinking:
 Maxim251: In my logic class, was responsible to move quin, move wariors, make choices beetween them, also menagig map, to chouse what choice quin and wariors should do. But now, I think,, hat maybe quin and wariors, should have seperate classes atached to Quin class, and seperate for wariors, 
 Maxim251: which will make logic for the quin, logic fro the wariors, and logic for them all
 Maxim251: :unamused:
 BlaiseEbuth: One Classto rule them all, One Class to find them, One Class to bring them all and in the logic bind them.
 Maxim251: that means that I need now make more classes responsible for logic. 
 TimothyAlexisVass: In JavaScript we can get an array of regex matches in a string.
 TimothyAlexisVass: To extract numbers from a string one could use:
 TimothyAlexisVass: a=str.match(/\d+/g)
 TimothyAlexisVass: for hello123and2 a = ['123','2']
 TimothyAlexisVass: How can this be done with Perl?
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=perl+regex+match+numbers+in+string">https://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=perl+regex+match+numbers+in+string</a>
 Astrobytes: ^ exactly what I was gonna post
 Astrobytes: Might wanna pick up a bit of perl along the way&#160;;)
 armalitedev: sussy baka
 ChiefChippy2: $_=&lt;&gt;;print ' Number&#160;: ',$_ for(/\d+/g);
 BlaiseEbuth: あなたはばか、カエルです :rolling_eyes:
 Ran_42: anyone have a good tip for a shortest way to add line break to string in python?
 Ran_42: currently I just use s+"\n"
 QuickMathzs: 4 characters is pretty short
 QuickMathzs: depending on your situation, using an f string might be shorter
 gRuggRu.lol: hello! can somebody teach me the basics of coding?
 BigFishOutOfWater: yeah you just google and test and google and test until it does what you want
 Astrobytes: And try not to answer questions from an hour ago
 Astrobytes: :P
 BigFishOutOfWater: really, there's so much activity here that an hour is too long?
 Astrobytes: hehe, nah, but usually the person has gone already
 Ther89: I'm doing "Credit Card Verifier (Luhn’s algorithm)" and every test success but the visa one not but I don't know why. Can someone help me?
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: someone help me do mars lander episode 1
 Ran_42: is there a compressing for c# like for python with the eval utf16? (for code golf)
 Westicles: every language but haskell can do some form of that
 Ran_42: I tried to search for a minifer/golfer for c# but didn't found any,  did the codingame comminuty made one?
 Westicles: no
 Ran_42: ok thx
 Westicles: The best I have just runs the python utf with an overhead of 121 chars
 Ran_42: what do you mean by overhead?
 Westicles: characters needed beyond the solution code
 Westicles: like the non-gibberish characters for python is... 25 or 26 I think
 Ran_42: oh ok
 gRuggRu.lol: uhhh.... the person that told me to google thank you
 gRuggRu.lol: im doing the " custom game of life " thing but i dont know to google
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: someone help with mars lander episode 1
 ANONYMOUS42: wait episode 1? really
 OukedLeMonstreDebutant: Can i play it with coders strike back&#160;??
 OukedLeMonstreDebutant: Play with my friends **
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: i need help with Mars Lander Episode 1 anyone got the solution
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: :triumph:
 ANONYMOUS42: here main(){for(;;)puts("0 4\n0 3");}
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: is that the solution do i add to the default code?
 ANONYMOUS42: nope that's it in C
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: ok
 ANONYMOUS42: or even better: yes "0 4\n0 3\n" 
 ANONYMOUS42: in bash
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: is it this
 ANONYMOUS42: actually maybe not the bash one
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: "0 4\n0 3\n" 
 OukedLeMonstreDebutant: can i play tic tac toe with friends&#160;? and how&#160;?
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: ANONYMOUS42 
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: do you got more answers to diffrent challages
 ANONYMOUS42: no
 ANONYMOUS42: i only did this one
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: .
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: ANONYMOUS42 
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: can anyone help with me  shadows of the knight episode 1
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: ANONYMOUS42  you did that one
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: whats answer
 Westicles: this is what happens when you do that
 ANONYMOUS42: can you block some jc
 ANONYMOUS42: someone*
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: anyone got the answer to shadows of the knight episode 1
 LittleFlea: are you sure you just want the answer...
 LittleFlea: codingame is a learning tool .
 AwardWinningSpoon_1d63: answer give me it please
 Jay10890: yah give it to him hes begging

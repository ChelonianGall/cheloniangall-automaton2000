 gabe2code: obviosly, javascript
 JLukeSkywalker: just had a clash of code made by Fillan, reverse where you had to make an ascii thing that looks like __|__|___|
 JLukeSkywalker: 100% tests, 0% verification
 JLukeSkywalker: everyone got a 0%
 JLukeSkywalker: tried looking it up on the CG Puzzle search, but it isnt on there
 Westicles: It was approved a half hour ago.  Just downvote and the moderation bot will get it

 random12313: how can i like floor division
 random12313: but not floor divison
 random12313: example 0.99 to output 1
 random12313: and 0.69 to 0.7
 random12313: top division
 Vigasaurus: for the former, most lanugages have a ceil
 Vigasaurus: the latter would need a round(1) or similar
 random12313: ty
 random12313: math.ceil is the answer
 lopidav: hi all. In js how do I overwrite fetch so on client-side so when the response is there my code is executed? 
 Vigasaurus: you'd need to use the promise `.then` format (or async) and then supply a callback - see: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch</a>
 lopidav: oh, thank you very much
 lopidav: ok, doesn't look like that's what I need. Fetch is not performed by my code. I try to detect when it's performed, catch the data, and do some stuff. Do I need to overwrite "then"?
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: hii

 Passifi: oh sweet jesus finally a puzzle of the week I can solves ,oh the joy&#160;:) 
 Passifi: I'm pretty sure last weeks problem is going to take me another week to solve :upside_down:
 CALLmeANIKET: python coders are not coders they are script kiddie
 CALLmeANIKET: they just apply functions and libraries
 Passifi: so anyone who isn't coding in assembler isn't a coder&#160;? 
 muraterogl: You need to write machine code directly, otherwise you are a script kiddie
 muraterogl: All languages have pros and cons, python is really good for creating working prototypes in short amounts of time. Don't need to be toxic about it
 Uljahn: libraries save your time which is the most valued resource
 Passifi: and if you want to be toxic about it concentrate on its true flaws the way its syntax look :thinking:
 Passifi: code is like live. it needs brackets and semicolons to be beautiful&#160;:)

 CodeHub-CreamPy: CALLmeANIKET is sad... give him/her hugs
 Wontonimo: no thanks
 Wontonimo: @Uljahn spits facts, libraries save time
 Wontonimo: "Script kiddie" - that's the funniest insult I've read in a long time.  I guess I'm a script kiddie then and have been for over 30 years.  Makes me feel young, thanks.
 Rbee: :joy:
 CodeHub-CreamPy: being a script kiddie means re-using already written program without knowing how to replicate that said program (for me that is)
 CodeHub-CreamPy: :joy:
 Uljahn: b-but you can't debug your code if you don't understand how library algorithms work and how to detect their possible nonsensical behavior
 dCSeven: Beeing able to debug ones code and knowing how libraries work are two different things (at least for me) The core point of the script kiddie thing normally is, that libraries one doesn't understand can do a lot more than what is needed, which can cause performance, security or other problems --&gt;  knowing how things work and what they do before using them is key to avoid later problems

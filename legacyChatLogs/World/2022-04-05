 ASM_MOV_INT: website took forever to load
 ASM_MOV_INT: take taco
 ASM_MOV_INT: run.oprah() - everyone gets a taco!
 LelouchVC2: id rather get ur number
 ASM_MOV_INT: 0118 999 881 999 119 7253
 ASM_MOV_INT: only use it for emergencies though...k?
 LelouchVC2: oh.. i already texted
 ASM_MOV_INT: :joy:
 ASM_MOV_INT: i hope you paused before typing that last number
 LelouchVC2: e google
 LelouchVC2: ez*
 SilverEagle: take taco
 CodingFasterThanWifi: i dont even know how to code bruh
 ASM_MOV_INT: bruh
 ASM_MOV_INT: you'll be smarter than a russian hacker in no time!
 CodingFasterThanWifi: its so damm hard i hate this

 TheAwardWinningGiantOfWisdom_d0a9: hi folks
 TheAwardWinningGiantOfWisdom_d0a9: are there head hunting opportunities for participating in a contest?
 iK4oS: Is clash of code broken?
 isimkullanmiyorum: is clash of code closed&#160;?
 Pythonista_TN: and most important question&#160;: when it will be fixed&#160;?!

 ETET: join if you want to
 ETET: take taco
 ETET: TAKE TACO
 ETET: why does it not work???
 Passifi: antiwonto is sustained by sunflower oil and or wontimos love and they are both all gone
 ETET:&#160;?
 Passifi: the bot is down&#160;:)
 ETET: lol
 Uljahn: guess the bot is self-hosted on Wonto's PC, so it's not available 24/7
 Passifi: no why somebody would leave their pc long enough to warrant shutting it down is beyond me of course 
 Passifi: but its a free country 
 ETET: lol
 ETET: how long do u spend on this web?
 Passifi: actively maybe  an hour or two or so
 Pacut: like 2 hours
 SaN099: can anyone teach me javascript?

 Hugesn0wduck: hello!
 Thorcode: omg
 Thorcode: this is the first time why the game infor can be time out?
 Hugesn0wduck: wdym?
 Thorcode: a  nothing
 Hugesn0wduck: oh ok
 Thorcode: just trying to solve escaping the cat XD
 Hugesn0wduck: oh xd
 Hugesn0wduck: i dont really participate on this website anymore
 Hugesn0wduck: just use it for help from time to time
 Thorcode: yep me too
 Thorcode: but sometime i want to try some puzzle for fun
 Hugesn0wduck: thats great. the more practice the better
 AndreasD: My questmap is bugged, does anyone know how to get on from the first mission?
 TanninCole: I am having the same issue with my quest map.
 Thorcode: like?
 TanninCole: I have solved the Onboarding puzzle multiple times, but the quest map says I need to solve it to continue. 
 Thorcode: try to restart google&#160;?
 Hugesn0wduck: tannincole in what way? is it saying you have correctly solved it or that it doesnt say that you were correct and that you cant continue?
 TanninCole: I have several indicators that I have correctly solved it (like "My progress: 100%" and I have the ACHIEVEMENT "Onboarding Master"
 Thorcode: I think it might be memory exceed on google
 Hugesn0wduck: maybe
 Uljahn: Codingame's database is having issues today, so quest map updates are paused atm, they'll be resumed later
 Astrobytes: Good afternoon.
 TanninCole: Thank you
 Hugesn0wduck: oh i see

 Hugesn0wduck: astrobytes good afternoon to you aswell!
 eulerscheZahl: DB issues? did Thibaud inform the devs already?
 eulerscheZahl: also: hi
 Astrobytes: it's known yeah, Tibo posted in the forum link Uljahn gave
 Thorcode: hi Astro
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, didn't click
 Astrobytes: hello Thorcodo
 eulerscheZahl: didn't expect onboarding to contain info about the quest map
 Astrobytes: Knowledge. Knowledge everywhere :P
 eulerscheZahl: and a contest is close
 eulerscheZahl: hype
 Astrobytes: The hype is not intense enough yet I feel, though I am looking forward to it
 Astrobytes: Just hope most of the usual suspects will participate
 eulerscheZahl: 7.5k registered. not bad, not impressive
 Astrobytes: there will be more I'm sure
 eulerscheZahl: last bot contest had 16.8k registered
 eulerscheZahl: and 6.8k playing
 Astrobytes: It's only the 5th currently&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: true, still some time to register. i predict 4k participants who submit
 Astrobytes: I'll take 5k, feeling optimistic
 eulerscheZahl: both is high compared to similar events (topcoder, RAIC, ...)i'm glad we get another chance
 Thorcode: I hope this contest gonna be hard
 Astrobytes: Very true, and yes, I'm grateful for it
 Astrobytes: Also it's a bonus given the highly unfortunate lack of RAIC 
 eulerscheZahl: TCO finals should be around November. Yes, I watched parts of their weekly stream recording just to obtain this information
 eulerscheZahl: and they hope to do it in person
 Astrobytes: lol, oh right. Where is it held?
 eulerscheZahl: USA most probably. they switch the city/state
 Astrobytes: As long as it's not FL it should be fine then :D
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get the joke about florida
 eulerscheZahl: is that where Trump lives?
 Astrobytes: it's a hotbed of covid
 Astrobytes: and covid denial/deniers
 eulerscheZahl: last contest was in Texas I think
 eulerscheZahl: *looks it up* Houston
 Astrobytes: Nice. I have a friend who lives there, incidentally.
 eulerscheZahl: you can still qualify via TCO stage 4&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol, I doubt it
 eulerscheZahl: the hotel they took in 2019 now currently costs about 210€ per night :o
 Astrobytes: They pay all expenses upfront right? 
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: just thinking about how much such an event costs
 Astrobytes: A lot. But they have a lot of financial backing
 eulerscheZahl: 210€/night * a few nights + flightand multiply by 70 finalists
 Astrobytes: + function suite + refreshments * (finalists + staff)
 eulerscheZahl: + money prizes
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Hugesn0wduck: is anybody good with history? i need someone to test my game and see if cloud variables work
 Hugesn0wduck: nvm got it to work
 esd: i do it for 100$
 therealbeef: how do you make an opening book? do you let your algorithm run for a long time, or do you let your bot play against itself and check which openings lead to wins?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey therealbeef, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 36 tacos
 therealbeef: drop taco
 therealbeef: drop :taco:

 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has move to the #taco channel
 Wontonimo: you can now get your attributes using "get attributes" or "taco powers" in the #taco channel
 Wontonimo: also, shakedown has moved there as well
 Wontonimo: hope everyone enjoys
 Wontonimo: also, "drop" now works in addition to "throw"

 MrBear1337: what's the best way to _memorize_ algorithms? i have a job interview with amazon and it seems like i need to know 20 or so common algorithms by heart

 Rebollo: Guys anything related to Natural Language Processing in CG?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/markov-text-generation">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/markov-text-generation</a>
 Wontonimo: but nothing advanced
 Rebollo: thanks
 Rebollo: what would be the best approuch to create a Natural Language to SQL app
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what do you mean?
 Wontonimo: do you want to translate natural language into working SQL&#160;?
 Rebollo: yes that´s the idea..
 Wontonimo: ha
 Rebollo: I mean best ML algorithm, or laguage, or library
 Rebollo: I would like to use js
 Wontonimo: hmm ... let me think ... cutting edge domain, do a task that 99% of the population doesn't know how to do, no training data ...
 Wontonimo: got it, use tensorflow.js
 Wontonimo: how though?  You'll definitely want to write a paper about it because it'll be a breakthrough
 Wontonimo: seriously, that would be crazy difficult
 Wontonimo: perhaps start with something a lot easier
 Wontonimo: like spelling and grammar correctionj
 CoolandonRS: Is there a way to reorder test cases on a contribution?
 Rebollo: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 Rebollo: lol lol lol lol
 Wontonimo: sorry if i came off as unsupportive Rebollo&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: tensorflow.js is a good js based neural net framework.  you can definitely do NLP with it
 Rebollo: that´s ok always good a dose of reallity
 Rebollo: but maybe I can learn something during the process even I can't achieve a reasonable result 
 Wontonimo: have you made a text generator NN yet using either a CNN or RNN&#160;?
 Rebollo: no never..
 Rebollo: maybe i will start doing so
 Wontonimo: oh, start with that!  it's super fun to see your NN create an infinite amount of bad monte python
 Wontonimo: or lord of the rings
 Wontonimo: a really simple RNN that just is character based is easy enough to make and fast enough to train that you can get lots of experience trouble shooting ... 
 Wontonimo: and there is TONS of trouble shooting ... god is there ever
 Rebollo: cool thanks for that
 Rebollo: definitely will start with that 
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/</a>
 Rebollo: I was checking a JS library simple as that
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e2b1cc66-5f35-43e9-829c-3d1f4add5e03">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e2b1cc66-5f35-43e9-829c-3d1f4add5e03</a>
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation">https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation</a>
 Rebollo: probably won´´t work, right?
 Rebollo: even if a provide tons os samples
 Wontonimo: do you want that as a training example of question/answer  so that given the question the NLP will respond with the answer?
 Rebollo: I would provide a question like
 Rebollo: How many employees does the company 'X' have?
 Rebollo: And the result woyuld be soemthing like
 Rebollo: Select count(*) from EMPLEYEES where COMPANY = 'x'
 SilverEagle: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Rebollo: Its a challenge but nothing´s impossible..
 Rebollo: Imagine thinking modern smart phones 100 years ago..
 ASM_MOV_INT: you are parsing natural language into SQL code
 Rebollo: yes thats the idea
 Rebollo: but would like to be able to perform more complex queries
 ASM_MOV_INT: how much flexibility does the input have? like what if they reword the input: What if I wanted to know the number of employees at company 'X'.
 Wontonimo: "for company 'x' tell me the number of employees"
 ASM_MOV_INT: interesting idea
 Rebollo: Maybe determining some keywords, classifying them, should do the work
 ASM_MOV_INT: exactly what I was thinking...!&#160;:)
 ASM_MOV_INT: if the given statement makes sense as only one command in SQL, then you have successful parse
 Rebollo: number, how many, quatity, amount, value, price,  cost
 Rebollo: soething like that
 ASM_MOV_INT: if more than one sql statement is possible from user input, ask a clarification question?
 ASM_MOV_INT: or if not enough to make a complete statement
 Wontonimo: i've worked on a few "4th level languages" since 1998.  Languages that were billed as "replace developers with business analysts because programming with this is so easy".  The problem is that people don't write very good english and don't rreally know exactly what things mean
 Wontonimo: i'm not saying it isn't possible to do.  I'm saying that non-programmers wouldn't be able to tell if the sql was want was intended
 Rebollo: I can also provide some "HELP" functionality
 Wontonimo: how do you plan on training it?
 Rebollo: By giving questions, or maybe only words, and as result SQL snippets or aybe coplete queries
 Wontonimo: to give some context, I have a NLP that just tells the sentiment of a sentence (if it is positive or negative) and it needs 100,000 training examples 
 Wontonimo: something more complicated like langauge--&gt;sql will probably need a lot more examples
 ASM_MOV_INT: I found a paper on the subject with a quick google search: natural language to sql
 Wontonimo: +100
 Rebollo: I got it but maybe parsing queries should be more straight forward once senntiment analysis is pretty subjective 
 Rebollo: sql seems to be more objective
 Wontonimo: okay, back to your count(*) from employees example
 Rebollo: yes
 Wontonimo: shouldn't it filter out employees that have been terminated?
 Rebollo: sure
 Rebollo: maybe onlt if asked
 Rebollo: or the result should provide by "categories"
 Rebollo: or by all toher coluns that hasnt been used
 Rebollo: or before executing
 Rebollo: would use something like
 Rebollo: "WOuld u like to be ore specific? The source table has tje following possible filters": <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4e8f7ad0-63c1-4a00-a582-1df7c5f1c5d4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4e8f7ad0-63c1-4a00-a582-1df7c5f1c5d4</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gigo is perfectly exemplified in sql.  I always have to do back-end maintenance as front-end users invariably find ways to multiply records or screw up field data.  Natural language example of "Set reminder for 6pm"  Still needs a delete at some point.
 Rebollo: Like directing the user to best way to use the tool
 Rebollo: I was thing soething like read only tool at first
 Rebollo: for analyytics purposes
 Rebollo: I would be happy if someone like to join me in the jorney :grimacing:
 Rebollo: deafening silence
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm working on escaping the cat
 ASM_MOV_INT: so far I just end up heading the mouse directly to the cat!
 a-Rye: same, and then I had the mouse go in circles until it ran out of turns...
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey a-Rye, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 2 tacos
 PatrickMcGinnisII: escaping the cat is pretty easy
 Wontonimo: outch!  I found it hard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's only two points to choose from, and they both involve the opposite angle of the cat.  *shrug*  yea, i guess at first ... but they make it easy cause the center of pool is at 0,0
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tmi
 Westicles: there's a nice 1-line solution (minus io) in python

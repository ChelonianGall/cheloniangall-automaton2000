 noidealol: hello guys I just recently had an interest of learning how to code but to my surprise it's so hard! it's like alien language haha This is not for me. 
 jwpapi: noidealol you probably try too much of a challenge, this website is not for absolute beginners
 miobyte: who can give me salt?

 ArianPunk: it's funny when you submit the puzzle and some tests fail without letting you to at least see the error ...
 jacek: some tests are invisible to prevent hardcoding
 ArianPunk: cause you might hardcode them! it don't make sense.
 jacek:&#160;!
 ArianPunk: as i said
 ArianPunk: you didnt read carefully
 jacek: :nerd:
 ArianPunk: it's ok. too hard for you.
 Uljahn: you can enable custom testcases in the settings on the left (mode -&gt; expert)
 ArianPunk: it is.
 ArianPunk: and i covered some cases too by custom mode, yet no progress when submitting.
 Uljahn: which puzzle?
 ArianPunk: nevermind
 jacek: i cant find it
 iamsofia_rless: hy 
 ArianPunk: found the issue in forum.
 jacek: :tada:
 emh: I want to optimize a lookup table for a matrix. how can I use symmetry of reversing columns and/or rows to divide the table by around 4 (so that it takes less than 1 second to init lookup table)?
 emh: I tried to maintain the invariant that first row should be less than last row and first row should be less than reversed first row
 emh: maybe I should think about first column and last column instead
 emh: my first invariant worked for around 10M out of 11M matrices
 emh: well.. I don't know that for sure, but at least the ones that didn't hit unitialized matrices
 jacek: 10M matrices? oO
 emh: out of 1&lt;&lt;24. I want to Smash the Code with 3x4 row (where row is 6 cols) connected component lookups
 emh: I know how to connect the 3 lookups fast
 emh: just the problem is to init the table fast enough. I could use 3 rows for 18 bit and 4 lookups instead to simplify
 emh: or maybe I should use a partial cache instead of initializing the whole table up front
 emh: I'm able to do 23 bits in 950 ms or so, that's why the last bit is annoying me haha
 jacek: try 23.5 bits
 emh: hehe
 emh: could just loop as far as I get in 1 second and do the rest dynamically
 emh: that would be 23.5 I guess
 jacek: afaik msits does his endbook tables in 1st turn in 1 second and few turns after
 emh: ahh ok, but then search suffers for it
 emh: maybe a good search is not so important for first few turns
 jacek: or ask him. i bet he can do everything in O(1)
 emh: hehe

 Astrobytes: spelling mistake in your stub text 'trasnposed', other than that looks good. Won't approve as I don't clash
 Astrobytes: be patient and approvals will come
 geppoz: I know, question already asked 1000 times, but:
 geppoz: first THROW then GIVE? or viceversa?
 putibuzu: first throw, then give
 struct: throw -&gt; give -&gt; and then you get the card
 geppoz: ty
 ThomasGottschalk: Im the real one
 ThomasGottschalk: Are there any girls here
 Astrobytes: Many. Now go away.
 Crosility: .. I'm sure there are. But it just feels creepy to ask.
 struct: thomas behave
 Violinie: :joy: is this a dating site? 
 ThomasGottschalk: Im a  girl too
 Crosility: I kinda think of the people here as a collection of like minded brains, not.. "what are you made of"
 ThomasGottschalk: can someone help me with level 1
 Kanawanagasaki: hmm, codingame still use C# 8.0
 ThomasGottschalk: Mad Pod Racing
 struct: follow the tutorial
 Violinie: hint: read the code carefully
 ThomasGottschalk: ok ok thanks
 jacek: Y Y or X Y :thinking;
 Ayza:       
 ThomasGottschalk: I cant doi level 1
 ThomasGottschalk: its already advanced
 ThomasGottschalk: Can someone help me with Mod Pod  Racing
 Crosility: Then back up, do some simpler puzzles.
 ThomasGottschalk: KO
 ThomasGottschalk: ok
 Crosility: At greater levels, there's a lot more complexity. If you aren't getting stage 1, you should definitely get some foundational understanding.
 Violinie: I'm  stuck too :grimacing::sweat_smile: where are easire ones?
 Crosility: Algorithms Tree
 Crosility: Horse Racing Duals, MarsLander, Power of Thor, The Descent..
 Crosility: To name a few.
 Violinie: I'll try it (again), thanks
 ThomasGottschalk: Hey Violinie
 Crosility: Keep trying, if still struggling, under Activities tab at the top there's a "Learn" Section.
 Crosility: If you sort by popular, lot of intro/beginner guides in your language of choice.
 Violinie: Great! Thank you :yellow_heart:
 Crosility: No problem.

 DomiKo: so I can't calculate how many cards are on board? or can I?
 struct: you can
 struct: sum of all cards
 struct: from 0-7 5-sum
 DaNinja: 5 - all your cards - all opp cards
 Astrobytes: it's that question again struct :D
 DomiKo: ehhh
 struct: I should have automated it
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 DomiKo: do it!
 struct: for bonus is 36 - sum and 100 - sum for tech
 DomiKo: thx
 DomiKo: I'm just starting to read eveything ehhh
 Astrobytes: plenty time DomiKo, also at least the bugs are all fixed now
 struct: I dont remember how to add commands to antiwonto
 DomiKo: Yeah, I've waited for that
 struct: Are you going to commit to the contest now DomiKo?
 struct: or you still don't have time?
 DomiKo: I'm going to
 struct: gl
 Astrobytes: that's the spirit!
 DomiKo: I need some time for preparation for internship, but I believe I have plenty left
 DomiKo: But that game looks hard to make something more than if-else
 Astrobytes: Priorities DomiKo, priorities! :P
 DomiKo: :sweat_smile:
 struct: Some people at the top have sim
 DomiKo: a little of sim?
 struct: last time I saw msmits he was bruteforcing all moves
 struct: + playing a few more
 DomiKo: that make sense
 DomiKo: I will try exactly the same
 DomiKo: should be easy to debug for 5th app
 Astrobytes: or just output first given move until silver ... :P
 struct: and some moves are easily pruned
 MSmits: yeah, me and euler do the same, just eval differs
 DomiKo: Astrobytes that's what I did :D 
 struct: Like you dont want to automate cards that you alredy have 2 off
 Astrobytes: lol :D
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 struct: you dont want to train if you cant draw
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: hi
 MSmits: hi
 struct: and a few more stuff
 struct: that should be obvious
 DomiKo: a lot of ifs to write
 struct: I only have 187 ifs
 ThomasGottschalk: EinsAchSiebeeen
 struct: But I have repeated code atm
 Astrobytes: 71 ifs here
 struct: MSmits I have one question for you, when you do coding do you draw all cards, or you draw 1 card and create a state for each?
 struct: If you don't want to reveal it's okay
 struct: No pressure, :hammer:
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: 76 if. close to astro
 eulerscheZahl: and i solved my timeouts i think
 struct: nice
 MSmits: draw all cards?
 MSmits: you can only draw 1 card
 eulerscheZahl: zobrist hashing
 struct: so you draw 1 and create a state for each of them?
 struct: I tried to draw all, I knew it was a bad idea, my sates exploded
 struct: :D
 eulerscheZahl: but for now i don't compute incremental hashes, so it's quite expensive
 MSmits: i use a recursive algorithm, like minimax
 MSmits: i dont create states
 MSmits: i modify
 Astrobytes: a dfs
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah dfs
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: backpropagating the result
 DomiKo: good old dfs
 struct: Yeah but coding draws 1 card
 MSmits: it does
 MSmits: and then it's on to the next phase
 eulerscheZahl: better known as single-player minimax to some
 struct: But which card do you draw?
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: i loop over all possibilities
 struct: ah ok
 struct: Thanks
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d46c9d1e-48be-44a5-80ad-19b61ca32347">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d46c9d1e-48be-44a5-80ad-19b61ca32347</a>
 MSmits: ah doesnt work
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: for (int i = 0; i &lt; singles.size(); i++)				{
 MSmits: hand[singles[i].card]++;					draw[singles[i].card]--;
 MSmits: totalProbability += singles[i].probability * Play&lt;normal&gt;(p + 2, false, depth + 1, 0);
 MSmits: you figure it out
 struct: Yeah, I understood it, thanks
 MSmits: it's a loop over all possible cards
 MSmits: and then i go deeper into the tree and weigh each result by probability
 MSmits: drawing 1 card means probability is easier
 MSmits: drawing 2 cards is more complicated, you dont want to split this into 2 phases
 MSmits: combining them into 1 probability of a cardpair is much cheaper
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: isn't it eulers job to leak ideas? :D
 Tien118: hi
 struct: hi
 DomiKo: hi
 ThomasGottschalk: hi
 StevenV: Invalid paste id, perhaps it expired?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have ideas to leak currently
 Astrobytes: Smits has got your back, all good
 DomiKo: I have ideas on how to steal ideas :D GUI now helps with that :D 
 eulerscheZahl: opening book for the first few turns
 darkhorse64: euler is watertight
 Astrobytes: It's that famous German engineering!
 MSmits: it's not much of a leak really
 MSmits: i already said before you need to try all possibilities and weigh by probability
 Astrobytes: nah I know, just poking fun while we still have a chat
 MSmits: ahh ok
 DomiKo: "still have a chat" :sob:
 struct: probabilities, I need to email a cat to get algos that do well with that
 eulerscheZahl: you are pulling us down
 MSmits: I'll share a lot of math after the contest. I have more probability stuff like this. It's mostly common sense though, I don't use fancy stuff
 darkhorse64: meanwhile, discord CG rooms are really quiet. 
 MSmits: you can work a lot of probability calculus out on your own with a pen and paper without needing a math class
 DomiKo: discord CG rooms?
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up linking other contests there, little to no response
 Astrobytes: the CG discord DomiKo
 Kowskaner: I cant even solve the Easy practise. I feel so dumb
 DomiKo: I thought they made some special rooms
 darkhorse64: that's wat I said
 Astrobytes: and the other Special CG Discord Room is for post-chat removal
 darkhorse64: that's what I said
 darkhorse64: oops
 eulerscheZahl: that's what she said
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, jacek isn't here
 DomiKo: someone had to do that
 jacek: but i am
 Astrobytes: then shame on you
 Astrobytes: for not outputting your normal responses
 darkhorse64: Could we write a jacek2000&#160;?
 Astrobytes: it would have to be a discord bot
 Astrobytes: (and be careful what you wish for!)
 miobyte: do u have salt?
 struct: plain text over here
 Astrobytes: we have salt by the kilo here
 MSmits: jacek are you training us like a nn?
 struct: no MSmits
 struct: dont give him ideas
 MSmits: sorry
 Astrobytes: :D
 putibuzu: :D
 jacek: :D
 putibuzu: funny thing: I just realized that each player only draws 4 cards per turn, thought for some reason it was 5 :sweat_smile: luckily I didn't hardcode it (too much) :D 
 geppoz: at start 4
 geppoz: but along the game that can become 5 or more
 putibuzu: true 
 geppoz: permanent skill ARCHI
 jacek: so permanent
 darkhorse64: permanent until release
 miobyte: is there anyone knows k8s?
 putibuzu: initially I thought the game had a bug and I spent 1+ hours reading the ref and trying to spot the "bug" :D :cry: :D
 borrel: there are bugs for sure
 borrel: a bit mio
 struct: I don't think there are more bugs
 struct: maybe the viewer can be confusing
 struct: But I haven't found anything else
 putibuzu: me neither
 borrel: thats good to hear
 borrel:&#160;:)
 putibuzu: but I agree the viewer could be better
 Astrobytes: it looks pretty at least.though it's better with the scrollbar app tooltips
 darkhorse64: There a minor ones: possible moves do not show trade bonus/skill, pile are not shown cleared in the outputs
 darkhorse64: piles
 putibuzu: wdym pile are not shown? 
 Astrobytes: fix those ankles
 darkhorse64: For instance, when the discard or draw pile is emptied, it does not appear in the inputs
 putibuzu: Ah yes
 putibuzu: but that is intentional from what I understand
 putibuzu: not sure why the dev wants it that way though :thinking:
 darkhorse64: Yes, but I think it's bad practice. Implicit behaviour always leads to problems
 putibuzu: true
 Astrobytes: afk 
 struct: Maybe he went over the limit of how many inputs he could send in total
 struct: But it's unlikely
 struct: I think the limit for sdk is around 100k?
 putibuzu: no idea :sweat_smile:
 darkhorse64: In this particular case, I was under the assumption that the whole state was published and did not clear my piles until I saw that my card counts were sometimes wrong. I moved 25 ranks higher in the top 100
 darkhorse64: when it was fixed
 darkhorse64: true, i should have read the statement more carefully and use more defensive programming
 eulerscheZahl: while i didn't make the same bug in my code, it surprised me as well that some input is missing
 eulerscheZahl: for me it was just null and i crashed
 struct: for me it was never a problem tbh
 struct: I didnt even notice it
 jacek: neither did i
 darkhorse64: All in all, it's a very nice job from [SG] guys. The artist is also outstanding
 struct: Yeah
 struct: The bugs were fixed pretty quickly 
 GNye22: Is there a way to do clash of code with a single language? As in, all players must utilize the same language? Cuz it's almost impossible to beat people using Python when I'm using Java
 struct: GNye22 only on private clashes, but sometimes there are clash events where everyone has to use the same language
 GNye22: ah ok, thanks
 j4at: boblob is beating everyone with C :p
 pedrosorio: GNye22 start using Python
 putibuzu: Agreed darkhorse64. I'm having so much fun with this&#160;:) 
 struct: jacek what was the max number of moves?
 jacek: 198 for referee
 struct: thanks
 jacek: without TASK_PRIORITIZATION n 8
 jacek: so 206?
 MSmits: yeah have to add 8
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: what do you want to do with that information?
 MSmits: I haven't needed that
 jacek: reserve()?
 MSmits: dunno what to use it for. I guess for a policy network to get the number of output nodes
 jacek: :thinking:
 jacek: you sometimes have weird ideas
 MSmits: i do
 struct: You caught me MSmits
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 putibuzu: on the NN topic: is someone training or working on an eval NN+ search?
 geppoz: what did you mean with "TASK_PRIORITIZATION n 8"&#160;?
 MSmits: if they are, they will keep it secret
 geppoz: you cannot swap with bonus?
 MSmits: geppoz the input doesnt give all possible actions
 MSmits: swapping with bonus is not included
 MSmits: but possible
 geppoz: ok ty
 putibuzu: MSmits hmm ok, I sometimes forget this is a serious competition :D
 putibuzu: I'm very curious about the PMs then :D 
 geppoz: and also swapping bonus with n&#160;?
 MSmits: all 9 cards with all 9 cards yes
 MSmits: excluding TD
 geppoz: ok ty
 emh: arghh.. somewhere in my code there is a 64 bit operation lurking among the 128 bit ones. chops my components at the 64 bit boundary. I want to find it. but how.. just read and read and read I guess
 putibuzu: refresh my memory please: CG starts timing my bot after all inputs have been accepted by my bot right?
 struct: no
 struct: after 1st input
 darkhorse64: after the first read
 putibuzu: oh ok thanks
 putibuzu: what happens if I have computationally intensive code before the first read? :sweat_smile: 
 putibuzu: timeouts I guess?
 darkhorse64: untested by me
 struct: you will use time anyways
 struct: and you cant really measure that time
 putibuzu: ok thanks
 struct: because the process is frozen
 putibuzu: I guess that is why my bot is timing out right now
 putibuzu: What is good practice to time the bot? start the timer after the first read, then read everything and do computations afterwards?
 struct: yes
 putibuzu: Ok great thank you very much&#160;:) 
 putibuzu: Let's see if I can make my bot work :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: new strategy: collect training+coding cards. immediately pass them on to your opponent and hope for timeouts
 putibuzu: :D 
 darkhorse64: stuff your opponent
 kovi: i like that eulerscheZahl
 struct: this makes me remember of pb4 test on ooc
 therealbeef: training + coding + task prio
 putibuzu: yeah task prio branches heavily :D
 geppoz: I think there is a missing input
 geppoz: the "play_count"
 geppoz: in player informations, when phase is "PLAY_CARD"
 darkhorse64: implement a counter that you clear on move
 putibuzu: in principal you can deduce it from preceding actions
 geppoz: y, ofc, but since it seems there is the assumption that all state is given...
 darkhorse64: wrong assumption
 geppoz: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can u cont_int a bonus skill card?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Naak11: how does this chat work?
 Astrobytes: People type, and people type responses. Like a conversation
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: np
 Naak11: wow, i hadnt realised tht
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: xmpp
 Astrobytes: but don't get too attached to it
 Naak11: why?
 Astrobytes: it's being removed later this month
 Hadd2: won't happen if we riot
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: the French spirit! :D
 Hadd2: devs don't try us 
 Naak11: why is it being removed?
 struct: Got an interesting error in c++
 putibuzu: they should make it a challenge: develop the best CG chat, easier to maintain, more mod tools etc etccommunity and CG will vote on the winner
 struct: Never saw it before
 Astrobytes: costly to maintain/replace, outdated, that kind of thing
 struct:  /usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: in function `_start':(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 struct: this in cg
 Astrobytes: linker error, weird
 struct: only happened once
 Astrobytes: did it happen quickly after the previous play?
 struct: I guess it can be that
 Astrobytes: only thing I can think of rn
 struct: thanks, I'll report if it happens often
 Astrobytes: it's an odd one for sure
 struct: to me it's irrelevant, but if it happens to a top player if might matter
 Astrobytes: indeed.afk again
 jacek: :iphone: :door:
 TINOUAINANI: hi, guys, I have a question, is there a way to know which 2 cards TRAINING will give you from draws&#160;? or it's completely random?
 eulerscheZahl: random
 TINOUAINANI: no specific seed in their source code?
 jacek: you can manually give seed
 jacek: options under ide
 jacek: and well, knowing seed would be cheating eh
 eulerscheZahl: still some unknown, what the opponent did
 TINOUAINANI: how do they generate their seed?
 eulerscheZahl: CG magic in the backend
 TINOUAINANI: ok thanks guys
 jacek: they use nuclear waste decay
 struct: seed += 1
 TINOUAINANI: another question, what's happened if the draws empty and you used TRAINING?
 MSmits: you get nuthin'
 MSmits: well discard would be reshuffled first
 struct: unless you have cards  in the discard pile
 TINOUAINANI: ok thanks
 TINOUAINANI: so if it's empty you get two cards from discard?
 struct: if the discard has enough cards
 struct: yes
 TINOUAINANI: thanks
 MSmits: better to put it like this: When your draw it empty, the referee puts your entire discard pile into your draw pile and then draws from your draw pile. It's also worth nothing that cards in your played pile stay there until the next turn
 TINOUAINANI: so I should put all discard in the draw pile before I draw two cards from it? what about if there is just one card in the draw pile do I need to get the second card from discard pile or just one that I find in the draw pile&#160;?
 MSmits: you get the one from draw, then empty the discard into the draw and then get one from there
 MSmits: thats what the referee does
 TINOUAINANI: ok thanks MSmits
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: if I download the referee and I use skeleton main, will all the bug fixes be in there?
 jacek: yes they are in master
 MSmits: master?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle</a>
 MSmits: yeah i am there, but there is a test folder. I am just wondering if that is something separate that did not get the fixes
 jacek: who cares about test
 jacek: but it got bugfixes as well
 pedrosorio: Msmits what do you mean something separate? The test folder contains unit tests
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: skeleton main is in test
 MSmits: thats what i use for running games locally
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, back up to about rank 250.  Still haven't gotten all the possible commands tightened up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er working
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i got one replay where i was starved down to 1 card
 PatrickMcGinnisII: holy hell
 MSmits: that takes effort
 struct: Skeleton main will run the the referee
 struct: I think thats how it works
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: i've built a brutaltester version of the referee
 MSmits: nice
 eulerscheZahl: but my param tuning failed me
 MSmits: mine gave me some improvement, but not a lot
 eulerscheZahl: right, wanted to create a bug report at brutaltester. doesn't compile anymore
 MSmits: oh
 struct: what do you mean doesnt compile?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, wrong
 eulerscheZahl: new log4j version throws a runtime exception
 PatrickMcGinnisII: any1 got the ref link handy?
 eulerscheZahl: but still compiles
 eulerscheZahl: the green box with starter kits right at the top of the statement

 PatrickMcGinnisII: that helped  rules.bigApplicationsCount = 12;
 PatrickMcGinnisII: starting to see trend in early game v. mid game, and of course endgame
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm 1.6B ways of choosing 12 out of 28 possible
 jacek: making opening book?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, non repeating
 jacek: i think its 30421755
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 30421755
 PatrickMcGinnisII: beat me to it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a bunch of symmetry but the play card abilities break it up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: game is becoming more interesting as you get into it, but the burden of 'entry' is high
 PatrickMcGinnisII: offset by random command to keep it interesting, w/o it ... who would play...smh
 eulerscheZahl: for the first few turns the application pool doesn't really matter. you have to collect boni first
 Astrobytes: "boni" :DAlways coming with that Latin
 jacek: boni?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mia culpa es phallus
 Astrobytes: correct Latin plural of bonus jacek
 jacek: quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum videtur
 PatrickMcGinnisII: back to Monty Python... dingus
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so profound
 eulerscheZahl: wow jacek, that's so deep
 eulerscheZahl: how would you say instead of "boni", astro?
 jacek: -That. - She
 DomiKo: XD
 Astrobytes: bonuses is more acceptable these days in English euler, though boni is correct Latin
 eulerscheZahl: as long as boni isn't wrong in english, i'll stick to it
 eulerscheZahl: 1 visum, 2 visaor1 visa, 2 visas?
 jacek: this is proper english too <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_ass">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_ass</a>
 Astrobytes: 1 visa
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no wonder technical_debt is so high, always forcing your boni in it
 eulerscheZahl: but not even 2 visae? that's sadspell check already tells me i'm in the wrong here
 Astrobytes: and bonuses is technically more correct than boni, since we're using English and not Latin
 jacek: :rage:
 MSmits: If you're using bonussen it is even more correct because it is Dutch
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: mutemus!
 MSmits: a mute mus?
 Astrobytes: We'll all just speak Latin regardless of language now then
 eulerscheZahl: "let's change that"
 MSmits: o
 eulerscheZahl: in German we say Boni btw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 5dn_l is the Muter
 Astrobytes: you can tell by the mut part that it's something to do with actively changing
 Astrobytes: e.g. mutation
 Astrobytes: or mutate
 eulerscheZahl: mutare
 Astrobytes: yes
 eulerscheZahl: mus = we
 struct: I'm lost
 Astrobytes: would you like directions in Latin?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :coffee:

 eulerscheZahl: this card game gives me a hard time

 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: The boni presumably

 eulerscheZahl: the eval
 struct: oh my

 eulerscheZahl: clueless

 eulerscheZahl: i might even do some if-else for parts of the game
 eulerscheZahl: hard to make the eval work in early and late game
 Illedan: Word
 struct: just have an eval per turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^
 struct: As you can see I'm an expert on writing evals
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder marathon should be up at this point but i can't find it
 eulerscheZahl: bad timing anyways, i'll stay on CG
 struct: Usually my eval is bool hasPlayerWon(int player)
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling that google translate failed me
 Illedan: In 6 hours
 Astrobytes: 26 o'clock
 eulerscheZahl: at 26 o.
 eulerscheZahl: that
 Nerchio: it starts today and tomorrow at the same time
 Astrobytes: like your parcel euler, omnipresent and time-travelling
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, it's tuesday
 Nerchio: is it?
 Astrobytes: until tomorrow, yes
 eulerscheZahl: the parcel didn't glitch to me yet
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 struct: I only know there is 5 days and 14 hours remaining, no idea what day it is
 Astrobytes: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: trying to stay in top half of silver b4 gold opens... how long until it does, ne1 know?
 eulerscheZahl: monday morning for those with a healthy sleep schedule
 struct: in 20 hours patrick
 jacek: tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: top 50% won't be enough for gold presumably
 eulerscheZahl: i predict 150 to gold
 jacek: just print second action
 jacek: and third action for legend
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: if there are no 3 actions? wrap around, modulo?
 struct: If everyone does 3 I probably can get rank 1
 Astrobytes: 150-200 for gold, hopefully the lesser, since it's a smaller silver league
 jacek: silver is too crouded
 jacek: crowded even
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't want a hardcore legend promotion
 eulerscheZahl: my bot sucks
 struct: last time it was like 2k silver
 struct: or something
 struct: on day 1 of silver
 Astrobytes: something like that yeah
 eulerscheZahl: last time we didn't have 50% stuck in wood
 Astrobytes: how many currently? (can't be ar$ed to look)
 eulerscheZahl: 680-ish in wood
 eulerscheZahl: 750 in bronze/silver
 struct: good thing I made it on day 1
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I probably would have quit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I didn't have to play cards to get in silver
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just didn't have to make dumb moves
 Astrobytes: nah you would have done something last minute struct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: basically avoid opponent +/- 1
 struct: I dont even know what my bot does yet
 struct: and I dont want to know
 Astrobytes: hahaha, as long as it works right
 jacek: me neither
 jacek: i question reality everyday since the contest started
 Astrobytes: because you're still playing it?
 Illedan: Give me a number to test?
 Astrobytes: 42
 jacek: 42069
 eulerscheZahl: pi
 jacek: 8008135
 jacek: 2137
 Illedan: Big numbers :thinking:
 Illedan: Searching 42 moves ahead might break things
 Astrobytes: pi x a lot
 eulerscheZahl: i see what you did there. except 2137, i don't get that
 Astrobytes: 2137 is lost on me
 jacek: its quite polished thing
 Nerchio: i submit my day1 code lets see where it ends
 Illedan: hm, 42 didn't crash
 Illedan: :O
 eulerscheZahl: 73: 21st prime. and 37 is the 12th
 struct: Do I need a syncedBeam like I did for SC21?
 Astrobytes: Illedan :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's something to consider. not knowing your next hand is painful though
 Astrobytes: the numbers 21 and 37 mean much more: it is the time of death of the Polish Pope John Paul II
 Astrobytes: ^ 2137
 eulerscheZahl: the last german pope is still alive
 Nerchio: its a meme in poland buts I am from Poland and I don't quite get it
 Astrobytes: I don't know why it's memeworthy
 jacek: then are you really a pole
 Nerchio: maybe not idk would have to check birth certificate
 eulerscheZahl: and investigated again, as he supposedly hepled to cover catholic activities
 struct: why is my code not working if (0) ...
 Illedan: Thx Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol euler, all the other ones were just better at it
 Astrobytes: np Illedan
 Illedan: 42 made me realise 3 was too small. 8 was better ^^
 Astrobytes: glad I could help :P
 Illedan: Maybe breaking top 10 :eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: catholic activities in regards to children. but let's get back to other numbers
 Illedan: *100
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: yes, my statement still applies 
 eulerscheZahl: the user i reported 1 or 2 days ago got deleted btw. i think you missed it, jacek saw it
 Astrobytes: I missed this I think yes
 jacek: i saw many things
 struct: poor jacek
 Illedan: draw vs emh :tada:
 Astrobytes: nice&#160;:)
 Illedan: With 10
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: On submit
 Miki09: lol hardcoded first 4 moves pushed me up 200 places&#160;:-D
 Illedan: First 4 moves?!
 struct: like a book?
 Miki09: go to 4, than 5 than 6 than 7
 Miki09: every time I do this
 Illedan:&#160;:/
 Nerchio: insane strat
 Illedan: Don't reveal that now
 Miki09: ok
 Illedan: :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Nerchio: Illedan your submit is 1 position near my day1 bot
 struct: what if the opponent goes to 6 Miki09?
 struct: what do you do?
 Miki09: nothing
 Miki09: I have to work on that
 Illedan: Nerchio, my day1 bot is top 50
 struct: my day1 bot is silver
 struct: There are many copies of it
 Nerchio: i submitted day 1 to see that I am sane and going into the right direction lol
 Illedan: I never look back :D
 Nerchio: but it pretty much knew how to play player1 only
 Nerchio: i like how codingame asks me if I want to submit without testing my code and I click yes every time, i test in production
 Astrobytes: It is the CG Way
 Suenodk: Haha testing in production nice :grin:
 Miki09: place #193, enough for today&#160;:-)
 Miki09: gn everyone
 Astrobytes: gn Miki09
 struct: gn
 Suenodk: that's high! Gn&#160;:)
 Nerchio: the amount of games played in a submit is really nice
 struct: How many is it?
 struct: 200?
 eulerscheZahl: 2*90 i think
 MSmits: man this is the creepiest thing ever. I just found out my windows connected to my work account since yesterday and it started controlling some settings
 MSmits: compiled bots started getting deleted because they were untrusted exe files
 Astrobytes: :scream:
 MSmits: had to disconnect it
 MSmits: but sheesh
 Astrobytes: Yeah... keep that disconnected
 MSmits: I don't know what  i did to connect it
 Astrobytes: do you VPN into your work system using that one?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: I do use one-drive to synchronize some files
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes: and you were worried about smartphones!
 MSmits: The other day they turned on one-drive on my work laptop. I had some private files on there (some cpp files and such) and they just started synchronizing the entire my documents folder, instead of letting me decide which folders (how it was before)
 MSmits: lots of colleagues had their private files synchronized to the cloud
 Astrobytes: d'oh!
 MSmits: it's not like we were not allowed to have some private files on there, it was specifically allowed to have some limited private usage
 MSmits: doesn't mean they can just force us to put it in the cloud...
 Astrobytes: Yeah but it shouldn't come with consequences like that
 MSmits: and now this crap.... pisses me off
 MSmits: I'm thinking of going outside my school system entirely. Feels safer to me
 Astrobytes: backed up? Your deleted bot exes I mean
 Astrobytes: and yeah, you're not wrong
 MSmits: ahh they are not important really. I can just recompile. It's just kind of annoying when my brutaltester version crashes because there is no bot
 Astrobytes: ever so slightly yes
 jacek: good thing they didnt delete oware database
 MSmits: i have that backed up a few times&#160;:)
 jacek: humanity treasure
 MSmits: indeed
 Astrobytes: I'm surprised you haven't memorised it by now :D
 Astrobytes: Or haaaaave youuuu
 MSmits: 98 GB of pure binary code... sure, here goes:.....
 MSmits: 101010111010111...
 struct: you are joking but today I saw a video of a guy that wanted to be chess world champion, by training just 1 month
 Astrobytes: damn right! :D
 struct: his plan was to memorize all chess positions
 Astrobytes: wtf
 jacek: plot twist: its chess960
 Astrobytes: and how far did he get with that particular endeavour?
 MSmits: did he understand what it meant to say "all chess positions"&#160;?
 struct: I don't think so
 MSmits: btw, it's not enough to memorize all chess positions
 MSmits: that's like a map with keys and no values
 struct: ofc he would eval them aswell
 MSmits: ahh i see
 struct: his idea was to play like a computer
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNv-FJFGTg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNv-FJFGTg</a>
 struct: Not worth the time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: one of my hosts that i pay, shutdown a couple websites that i run my own encrypted text files as data storage (customer email addys mostly) ... host identified txt files as malware and they wouldn't turn the sites back on til i deleted them...I was so pissed.  still pissed.
 Astrobytes: oh haha, I watched part of that video years back
 MSmits: thats annoying PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: as long as they're not 'text files' that decompress a load of powershell when opened and then hide in your registry to do Bad Things :P
 MSmits: what a dumb guy, he could have at least used a professional chess engine
 struct: I can't take it seriously 
 struct: This probably must be satire or something
 MSmits: maybe 
 Astrobytes: I don't think he expected to win tbh
 Astrobytes: or to get very far
 eulerscheZahl: i see a youtube link. did you do your homework already and watch Hasan Minhaj?
 struct: not yet euler
 Astrobytes: oh the game dev thing, yes I did
 Astrobytes: I had seen just over half of it apparently
 Psyho: it was probably asked like 20 times already, but how do people run the games locally?
 Psyho: i.e. what's the easiest way of running the tester locally
 eulerscheZahl: single-threaded: you clone the referee and insert your bot into the main class
 jacek: double click on .exe file
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/master/src/test/java/SkeletonMain.java#L21">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/master/src/test/java/SkeletonMain.java#L21</a>
 eulerscheZahl: for multi-threading there is a tool called brutaltester. but you have to adjust the referee. i can share a pre-built jar of referee+game engine if you want
 MSmits: that would be great eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: i dont have the multi variant, just single
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://easyupload.io/y86u11">https://easyupload.io/y86u11</a>
 MSmits: thanks
 struct: thanks
 struct: here is the brutaltester link<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 eulerscheZahl: execute it with something likejava -jar cg-brutaltester.jar -r "java -jar GreenCircle.jar" -p1 "dotnet SocieteGenerale2022.dll" -p2 "dotnet SocieteGenerale2022.dll" -n 100 -t 8 -s
 eulerscheZahl: i added the brutaltester to the upload
 MSmits: 1.0.0 is latest?
 eulerscheZahl: i built from source yesterday
 MSmits: no i meant the link struct shared
 eulerscheZahl: java -jar cg-brutaltester.jar -r "java -jar GreenCircle.jar -s" -p1 "dotnet SocieteGenerale2022.dll" -p2 "dotnet SocieteGenerale2022.dll" -n 1to run a single game with local server
 eulerscheZahl: will be available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://localhost:8888/test.html">http://localhost:8888/test.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i increased the timeout from 50ms to 150ms and enforce bronze+ rules. if you don't like those changes, you have to compile your own referee
 Astrobytes: with blackjack, and hookers
 MSmits: oh you added the brutaltester jar too, nice service
 eulerscheZahl: as i mentioned&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, maybe it was a bad idea. GPL and i didn't upload the license file
 Astrobytes: shhh
 eulerscheZahl: let's hope Magus won't sue me other this :D
 Astrobytes: lol, I think he'll be understanding of the situation 
 jacek: they will fight <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoPqoctg21k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoPqoctg21k</a>
 Psyho: late thanks! 
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl does your brutaltester give 1 second on first turn?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 MSmits: weird, crashes for me
 eulerscheZahl: you can't even disable that i think
 MSmits: yeah i didnt think so either
 eulerscheZahl: did you run the 2nd command i shared? with 1 game and server mode
 eulerscheZahl: can so see the replay on that localhost site?
 MSmits: ok will try sec
 MSmits: tried: java -jar cg-brutaltester.jar -r "java -jar GreenCircle.jar -s" -p1 "1.exe" -p2 "2.exe" -n 1
 MSmits: crashes
 MSmits: maybe i should not do it from a bat file and use a cmd window
 eulerscheZahl: "crashes" - as accurate of an error message as some of my colleagues
 MSmits: yeah that worked
 eulerscheZahl: yay
 MSmits: i think i should have added a line to my bat file to prevent it from stopping
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/oKlImZ6">https://imgur.com/a/oKlImZ6</a>
 MSmits: i was wrong, didnt work
 MSmits: it gave the typical endgame result, but it does that on an error too i guess
 eulerscheZahl: you can ignore that message
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://localhost:8888/test.html">http://localhost:8888/test.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: does that show anything?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't bother to investigate about the log4j message as the rest is still working fine
 MSmits: no, but i have an idea
 MSmits: what i fi have my own brutaltester running on my system
 MSmits: (I do)
 eulerscheZahl: did you add it to your PATH variable?
 MSmits: it says another process is using codingame assets
 MSmits: HUD.json
 MSmits: i will wait till my other process is gone
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like another instance running
 MSmits: yeah could be that. 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off for today
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 eulerscheZahl: after helping the guy who's already 2-3 score points ahead of me
 eulerscheZahl: i always make the same mistakes
 struct: gn
 struct: gn
 MSmits: hehe sorry euler, i'll figure it out no worries&#160;:)
 MSmits: you go do some more tuning
 MSmits: or gn even
 JamesWrank: Hey guys I've been stuck at first place in wood ligue 1 for ages. Not sure what to do&#160;? ^^
 Astrobytes: Get to Bronze. That might help :P
 JamesWrank: Yeah okay but how&#160;? :D
 Astrobytes: Are you far from the boss points-wise?
 jacek: thats in DLC, pay $$$
 JamesWrank: not sure how you check that
 JamesWrank: boss was at 3rd place for a while
 Astrobytes: open the Leaderboard from the button on the left
 jacek: what game
 JamesWrank: Oh okay from that leaderboard I'm 3 points away from the boss
 jacek: you need to be better than him ~
 MSmits: btw... i realized something today. I thought we didn't have the full information on our opponent because we can't see his hand
 JamesWrank: Mhh right I thought my script was enough as I was winning like 95% of the fights
 MSmits: but we do. He has no hand
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I was gonna say if it was a little bit you might be pushed but you're gonna have to improve a little
 JamesWrank: Alrighty, I'll do that tomorrow&#160;:)
 MSmits: there's no fog at all in this game, just random
 JamesWrank: GN people
 MSmits: gn
 KINGKRINKLES124: hello
 KINGKRINKLES124: :grin:
 struct: The training makes it a bit harder MSmits you were right
 struct: hi
 MSmits: Yeah
 putibuzu: hmm MSmits we still don't know what opponent played
 KINGKRINKLES124: sorry if innterupting
 MSmits: does it matter putibuzu?
 putibuzu: yes, I think it does
 MSmits: if you know the full state, what does the past matter?
 MSmits: his full turn is done, you know his score, his automated, all his cards, etc.
 kovi: you dont know his hand
 putibuzu: Well, all I know is what deck in total the opponent has but not where his cards are
 putibuzu: exactly
 MSmits: you do
 MSmits: his hand is empty
 MSmits: his turn is done
 MSmits: everything is discarded
 MSmits: so you know everything
 putibuzu: only his hand and played cards
 putibuzu: are discarded
 struct: You know the cards opponent played?
 MSmits: yes, so everything is discarded
 putibuzu: the deck is not fully shuffled
 MSmits: which means you know the full state
 struct: ah i missunderstood
 MSmits: what does it matter what he had in hand during his turn, it is no longer there when his turn starts
 putibuzu: not sure if I understand what you mean MSmits
 MSmits: let me rephrase. you know the exact location of every one if his cards
 pedrosorio: Msmits, you don't know which cards are on the opponents (draw, discard) piles
 MSmits: you get this as input
 MSmits: OPPONENT_CARDS
 MSmits: OPPONENT_AUTOMATED
 pedrosorio: opponent_cards = draw+discard, no?
 putibuzu: but if you knew what he had in hand, and his discard and draw pile before his turn you would be able to compute probabilities of his next hand (i.e. his next ) turn and then you could easier predict what he does
 MSmits: opponent_cards is everything he has
 MSmits: and since everthing is in the same place, you know where it is
 pedrosorio: Msmits, draw and discard are different piles
 MSmits: ohh, right your discard is not shuffled into your draw pile
 putibuzu: true, but you don't know where those cards are, i.e. some are in discard, some are in draw, but where exactly you don't know
 MSmits: now i see my error
 MSmits: this only happens when draw is empty
 Astrobytes: only when draw is empty
 putibuzu: yeah
 MSmits: yes thanks
 MSmits: this cleared up a misconception for me. 
 putibuzu: I would love to have that additional info btw, like in a real boardgame. seeing what the opponent did
 MSmits: yeah, i think it would be good to have it, this game does not need randomness and fog both
 putibuzu: agreed
 putibuzu: btw in my simulation the opponent works exactly as you described
 putibuzu: take all cards and draw some at the start of turn randomly
 MSmits: take all cards?
 struct: all opponent cards
 struct: I guess
 MSmits: ohh
 putibuzu: exactly
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i tried this but doesnt do much fo rme
 struct: What about mcts but he has all cards in hand?
 putibuzu: hmm I'll see if I finally manage to submit :sweat_smile:
 struct: maybe he would end up playing too well
 Astrobytes: i'm not optimistic about that approach tbh
 Astrobytes: I could be wrong
 putibuzu: yes, I'm hoping to find out :sweat_smile:
 putibuzu: otherwise I don't know how to track opponent's cards properly 
 MSmits: if he has all cards in hand he can probably just finish any app with bonus cards and stuff
 putibuzu: I mean the only things difficult are additional draws
 pedrosorio: 50ms is very short, simulating the opponent may just not be that useful in this contest
 MSmits: you mean 2 out of draw pile and then another 2 from discard?
 MSmits: additional draws?
 putibuzu: ah no TRAINING and CODING actions
 MSmits: oh i got those working
 putibuzu: they mess with the opponent tracking
 MSmits: ah yes for opponent thats a lost cause
 putibuzu: unfortunately yes
 putibuzu: all other actions can be tracked perfectly right?
 MSmits: aside from the fact that most of the time you have no idea what he has in hand 
 putibuzu: sure :D
 MSmits: i mean you dont even know the possibilities
 putibuzu: difficult game, this is
 MSmits: yeah i guess it is
 CASPER_000: You have to find the sum of the first x powers of a number n starting from 0. You will find that this puzzle will be easier if you know the trick
 CASPER_000: any explaintiont
 struct: My code is a mess for this one
 CASPER_000: any explainetion
 MSmits: most of my code is reasonable except my eval stuff, that's starting to get worse and worse
 MSmits: a lot of stuff with parameter = 0 i am afraid to delete
 geppoz: CASPER_000 there is a math formula for that
 CASPER_000: ok what is it?
 TINOUAINANI: :smiley:
 geppoz: the finite equivalent of the infinite one that leads to 1/(1-x)
 putibuzu: the eval gets messy so easily :D one starts adding stuff here and there and suddenly there are 100 free parameters :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: the last few submits, every time i had an improvement it wasnt because of a new parameter i think
 MSmits: mostly because i found a bug and fixed it :P
 putibuzu: :D
 putibuzu: during spring challenge 2021 I had a buggy arena, which always said 100&#160;% winrate for the first bot and I was always putting my new version first, so I thought every change I made was incredible
 putibuzu: then I wondered how I was not #1 :D
 MSmits: heh sounds familiar
 putibuzu: found out during the last hour or so :D
 MSmits: ouch
 putibuzu: that's why people always say tests are important I guess :D 
 MSmits: yeah
 KINGKRINKLES124: you want to be friends
 KINGKRINKLES124: :smile::sweat_smile:
 MSmits: Astrobytes i figured it out. Now when you log into One-drive it has a little checkbox that asks if you want your organization to manage your computer
 Astrobytes: MSmits: ahhhh that would explain it
 MSmits: not sure if i checked it or if i already automatically logged in when they added the checkmark in an update (and set it to default to checked)
 Astrobytes: Nonetheless nefarious.
 MSmits: yeah it s
 MSmits: is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i disable Onedrive in startup
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so it can never sync
 struct: This is why I still use windows 98
 Astrobytes: 98? Noob. 95 is where it's at.
 struct: I heard that one is not supported anymore
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall r whack, NT
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 struct:&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: old argument, like 20 yrs ago
 Astrobytes: NT workstation 4.0 was the greatest
 Astrobytes: (seriously)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm hearing WIN11 noise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Win 8.1 uses the NT kernel... the kernel was the best in the day
 Astrobytes: Yup.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nt came on 4 3.1" floppies, lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 4MB OS imagine that
 struct: I get like 10k moves on 2nd round, is this normal MSmits?
 struct: with all possible combinations
 PatrickMcGinnisII: people on YT bitching about encrypted HD issues
 Astrobytes: malware-encrypted?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: WIN11 bitching about bitlocker
 Astrobytes: oh bitlocker
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gotta stop watching YT
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and MS, they might geet mad and brick my pcs
 MSmits: 10k moves&#160;??
 MSmits: struct do you mean on move selection?
 struct: I just got lke 4Million on one...
 MSmits: also do you allow infinite training/coding depth?
 struct: no
 MSmits: how much depth/
 struct: 1 depth so until release
 struct: from move to release
 MSmits: i mean
 struct: all moves, like move 0-8
 MSmits: how many played cards max
 struct: no limit
 MSmits: ahh ok, i do 3 max currently
 struct: ah
 MSmits: i can do better if i optimize
 struct: i guess I can try that
 MSmits: but i also use some tricks
 MSmits: i'll give you one
 Astrobytes: you might be repeating states too with that many
 MSmits: for cards that are not training or coding, make a playing order
 MSmits: reset the order on draw
 MSmits: so for example, you can make an order so that you are never allowed to play architecutre after review
 MSmits: this prevents the situation where you have a state where you first play review and then arch and a state where you play arch, then review
 struct: oh
 struct: I guess that can happen in my code atm
 MSmits: zobrist can do this too, but i dont like using it
 Astrobytes: that's what I was getting at with repeating states
 struct: ah
 MSmits: just make sure to only fix orders for cards where the play order doesnt matter
 MSmits: and reset the order after a draw
 Astrobytes: makes sense
 MSmits: yeah, you have to be real careful not to prune too much with the repeating states
 MSmits: if repeating states contain random, they are not truly repeating
 Astrobytes: naturally
 Michael_Howard: Is Task Prioritization really rarely useful to play, or am I just doing something wrong? :thinking:
 MSmits: it can be really powerful
 MSmits: especially if you need 1 specific card to finish the last app
 struct: well limiting draws put me from 4M to 20k
 struct: or something
 MSmits: remember, if you use task prio, it is still your card, it just goes back in your deck
 MSmits: you only really lose the traded card
 struct: yeah
 Michael_Howard: I expected it would be powerful on last turn, but it never seems to be. I can't figure out why.
 MSmits: should be useful in some situations on last turn
 MSmits: the thing is, last turns are selections out of many possible turns that could have happened due to draw
 MSmits: oftentimes you are lucky enough on a last turn that you dont need prio to make it better
 MSmits: you should test it differently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm still trying to debug detecting a release beforre a potential release phase... yall r so far ahead
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/644127136">https://www.codingame.com/replay/644127136</a>
 MSmits: look at earlier turns that werent a last turn and ask yourself, if i had a prio now, would i have won
 struct: Here I timeout bcause I have like 19 cards on draw pile
 struct: I think ill need to go back to the drawing board for this one
 MSmits: training can only ever make you branch 55x max
 MSmits: per played training card
 MSmits: usually it is less
 struct: 55?
 MSmits: yes
 struct: why 55?
 MSmits: you take 2 cards out of 10
 struct: ah ok
 struct: I forgot training is not coding
 MSmits: 2 the same * 10 + 9 + 8 + 7... + 2 + 1
 Astrobytes: don't do that irl
 MSmits: I'm being pushed hard, 4th now, but so many people submitting i guess
 MSmits: so i am not actually 4th
 Astrobytes: doesn't matter much at this point
 Astrobytes: "high up" is enough til gold
 MSmits: well it gives me confidence i will get legend, that is the most important goal for me
 Astrobytes: True, depending how much more time you have to spend that is sensible
 MSmits: yeah, i have a lot of time left. Not sure if my boss agrees but he doesnt have to know i put all my work off till monday
 Astrobytes: I like your style :sunglasses:
 MSmits: this is the first contest in like 2 yrs i played very seriously
 Astrobytes: I noticed
 Astrobytes: :D
 kovi: the only boss you need to care is the gold one
 MSmits: yeah kovi
 Astrobytes: May I ask why? The probabilities thing?
 MSmits: they are usually terrifying
 Astrobytes: last question @MSmits
 MSmits: i do like the probabilities thing, but i already decided beforehand i was going to do this seriously
 Astrobytes: Nice. I'm glad about that
 MSmits: It started when i had a pretty annoying cold last week and i just kept working day and night to make sure i had no work last weekend
 MSmits: even though ifelt sick, so thats motivation
 Astrobytes: And dedication
 MSmits: yeah, i didnt get much notice on the contest
 MSmits: otherwise i would have prepared sooner
 Astrobytes: I had 6 days I think, I have no idea when it was put up on events page 
 MSmits: me neither, not long anyways
 Astrobytes: was thanks to 5DN1L that I saw it
 Astrobytes: woops, didn't mean to ping
 MSmits: havent seen 5DN1 L
 jacek: but did you see Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i could look at the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: I logged in after a few weeks, literally right on time as he posted the events page link
 Astrobytes: (5D, not that bot)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits you bot goes straight to cont_int to automate bonus, and then skips releases to avoid debt...did you setup a debt ceiling? holy crap
 MSmits: i dont know, i make eval and fit parameters. My bot figures out the rest
 MSmits: i did have a debt ceiling i think, dont want to have more than 2 TD debt on release
 MSmits: but i changed it to 3 or 4 and it had no effect on the bot
 MSmits: eval prevents those releases
 MSmits: i havent watched a game in days PatrickMcGinnisII :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm using cont_int on bonus cards... it is so necessary for endgame
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, if you see good bots do this
 PatrickMcGinnisII: But i don't skip any releases and get debt piled on
 MSmits: i see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prettu much i geet 3 releases very fast
 MSmits: it would not surprise me if my bot does not do that cont_int thing if it has to give a card to get there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then last two r slow af
 pedrosorio: MSmits how do you fit params for eval? Local tournaments between your bot variants?
 MSmits: pedrosorio yeah nothing complicated
 MSmits: i was going to do something more complicated, but my bot changes too fast and i spend most time quickly testing changes
 MSmits: maybe last weekend i will do something like this
 MSmits: smarter param fitting
 MSmits: but i doubt i will have the time
 jacek: smrter grid search?
 pedrosorio: jacek simulated annealing where temperature decreases to 0 as end of contest approaches
 MSmits: yeah there are many methods
 Astrobytes: lol pedrosorio
 jacek: GA!
 antiwonto: [auto] 'GA' was defined as ' Genetic Algorithm '
 Illedan: Damn play limit -.-
 struct: Damn brain limit -.-
 struct: Illedan are you testing localy?
 Illedan: Just in IDE
 struct: euler pasted here in chat referee for brutaltester
 Michael_Howard: Is it better to continuous integrate a bonus or a skill card?
 Astrobytes: the former in a lot of cases it seems
 Illedan: Depends on the skill card vs applications left 
 Illedan: Early game =&gt; Bonus
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no wonder i'm not detecting releasable apps, I'm not counting automated,  ARGH!
 Astrobytes: again?
 Astrobytes: that's twice you've done that!
 Illedan: Almost top 50 :tada:
 Astrobytes: grats Illedan
 Illedan: I had a fat big TODO in my Throw sim
 Illedan: xD
 struct: My bot is not normal
 Illedan: Wonder where that comes from
 Illedan: :smirk:
 struct: ah ok
 struct: Its just user that is dumb
 struct: my bot is fine
 jacek: he copied his NN into the bot
 Astrobytes: pebcac!
 struct: I was evaling only Continuous integration cards
 struct: and was wondering why my bot chose to go to 3 instead of 5
 Astrobytes: hehe nice
 struct: I forgot you can get a card from 5 with card 3
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/644163191">https://www.codingame.com/replay/644163191</a>
 struct: my blue bot doesnt even eval score
 struct: lol
 struct: and managed to win because it was the first action
 Astrobytes: does the first action thing still work?
 struct: no but since it was release phase
 Astrobytes: ah
 struct: my move gen gives release actions before wait
 struct: so since the score was the same it prints the 1st
 Astrobytes: I see
 Illedan: Lol, emh automated 3 Code_review xD
 struct: Finally I destroyed jacek
 struct: in one game
 struct: I can delete now
 Astrobytes: eh, even I did that earlier
 geppoz: I suppose never automate more than 2 of same card
 Illedan: Maybe in Legend geppoz
 Illedan: When you want to automate a card so that you wont use a draw on a card you don't need
 Illedan: But emh is not checking that
 Illedan: no way
 struct: and maybe you dont want to automate if its not in apps
 Illedan: True too
 geppoz: there are opposite requirement :D
 geppoz: automate what it is more in apps VS automate what it is not in apps
 Astrobytes: "room for further improvement"&#160;;)
 struct: I just want to make little progress at a time
 struct: as long as I see progress im happy
 Astrobytes: worked for me since last night
 struct: This is why I only submit after adding 1k lines
 struct: But my todo list keeps getting bigger and bigger
 Illedan: Can I have some todos? I'm out
 struct: its mostly simple stuff, the one that requires the most work atm for me is the states exploding
 struct: due to cards drawn
 struct: and I have the problem where I can have  alot of repeated states
 Astrobytes: TODO: get 1st place
 struct: also I need to write an eval
 emh: Illedan hehe
 struct: but I leave that to last days
 Illedan: ^^
 Illedan: New IF incomming
 emh: nahh I've been working on StC all day
 Astrobytes: if (not_winning) win();
 Illedan: stc?!

 Astrobytes: ^ :o
 Illedan: ok?
 Illedan: csb?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :taco: Astrobytes
 antiwonto: [auto] 'CSB' was defined as ' Coders Strikes Back (aka Mad Pod Racing) '
 antiwonto: [auto] PatrickMcGinnisII has awarded Astrobytes 10 tacos. Astrobytes now has 66 taco. PatrickMcGinnisII now has 60 taco
 Astrobytes: BotG
 emh: even with a 24 bit lookup table it was slower than bit bfs, so I wasted the whole day
 Astrobytes: Hah :P
 struct: emh and I have the same problem with STC
 struct: We optimize but never make a working bot
 emh: true true hehe
 Astrobytes: are you STILL doing that one struct?!
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: surely you've been at it longer than emh
 KINGKRINKLES124: im doing mad pod racing 
 struct: I went to try and avx CSB instead
 struct: i got 600k sims only
 KINGKRINKLES124: what are yall doing
 struct: by avxing collisions
 Astrobytes: oh right, you mentioned that
 struct: was expecting 1M
 struct: but meh
 Astrobytes: not bad though
 struct: ill go back to it later once contest ends
 Astrobytes: that smitsi?
 struct: no, just random search
 emh: my last contest submit was 1 day ago
 struct: but I didnt submit since i want to try smits
 Astrobytes: 600k ain't bad
 KINGKRINKLES124: are you doing clash of code
 struct: emh come back to the contest
 Astrobytes: No KINGKRINKLES124
 struct: STC can wait
 KINGKRINKLES124: sorry
 emh: I don't have a lot of ideas for new ifs
 KINGKRINKLES124: didnt mean to make mad
 struct: What about less ifs?
 emh: you mean CMPXCHG?
 Astrobytes: Or old ifs :sunglasses:
 KINGKRINKLES124: :disappointed:
 pedrosorio: Astrobytes what is smitsi?
 struct: Smitsimax 
 Astrobytes: aka UCT Forest
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476</a>
 MSmits: on my profile. Some ucb1 based search I came up with for multi agent games with not too many agents that weakly interact. Yeah uct forest
 MSmits: i do not use it in this game
 MSmits: just to be clear
 Illedan: Whaaat?!
 struct: ok i know what to use now
 MSmits: i don't lie :P
 struct: me neither, I just dont always tell the truth
 Astrobytes: *you are economical with the truth
 Astrobytes: truth when necessary, troll otherwise
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: a true art form imo
 struct: MSmits I think I understood what you meant on the order of actions to not repeat
 struct: So lets say I play action 2[daily routine]
 struct: Ok its a bit messy to explain
 struct: let me see if I can come up with an example
 MSmits: yeah it is difficult to explain
 struct: ok if I play 4[architecture]study, in theory I already tried all actions before it
 struct: so when I do move gen I only do after 4 right?
 struct: something like this
 struct: 4 being architecture
 struct: and before being task and daily
 struct: as long as they dont draw a card
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: thanks
 Astrobytes: wahey, one win vs emh :P 
 MSmits: i did this by passing a parameter "int order" down the dfs recursion, i only allow moves of the same order or higher. The order resets to 0 on draw
 emh: hehe
 struct: oh that makes it easier I guess
 struct: instead of doing it on move gen
 struct: smart
 MSmits: i did this before on locam i think. To much greater extent. You can look at my PM
 MSmits: it's a long time ago though
 struct: your PM is ancient by now
 Astrobytes: struct think of it like using moves from a transposition table or iterative deepening ab
 struct: if it doesn't include the word NN
 MSmits: it doesn't&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, i came up with this because i didn't know how to hash stuff&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ie. you know the previous moves from before so just check what's available at this current depth
 struct: I see astro, I think I got it
 struct: oh
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 struct: Im generating moves everytime
 struct: every state
 Astrobytes: I do love your inventiveness
 struct: maybe thats not optimal
 MSmits: yeah why learn something new that's easy when you can invent something yourself that's much more complicated
 Astrobytes: it's the scientific way! :D
 Astrobytes: at least you don't have to argue about grants, funding and ownership too :P
 Astrobytes: *Additional funding
 MSmits: yeah, I'm glad I have never had to do that
 MSmits: got into teaching quckly enough to avoid
 Astrobytes: likewise, job came up before research opportunities :D
 ruessin: does this website have mock assessments with 2-4 problems?
 struct: Sounds like certificates
 ruessin: i guess algorithmic certificates, if they exist. not looking to test knowledge of different languages
 struct: Then I guess the answer is no, but there are plenty of puzzles I guess
 ruessin: ok cool
 geppoz: question: you have to output every single action?
 geppoz: I mean if i already have MOVE+GIVE
 geppoz: can I output 2 rows in one turn?
 struct: bad idea
 geppoz: or I need to wait new inputs?
 struct: wait for new inputs
 PiterYeh: nope, it's one action per output
 geppoz: (experimentally seems not)
 geppoz: ok
 struct: in theory it works 
 struct: but you will still get the inputs
 geppoz: no, it doesnt
 struct: So it will go out of sync
 Astrobytes: Output for One Game Turn1 line containing one of the following actions depending on the game phase:
 geppoz: Line 1: gamePhase the name of the current game phase. It can be MOVE, RELEASE
 geppoz: :D
 geppoz: where are THROW_CARD, GIVE_CARD?
 Astrobytes: they failed at that part
 Crosility: Howdy! :D
 struct: hi
 Crosility: How's things going? Everyone still focused on the contest?
 Nerchio: no i am here to read the chat
 Crosility: (Seriously? Or sarcastically?)
 Psyho: It turned out the less I submit the higher I'm on the ranking so I stopped submitting
 Nerchio: I like the chat but not that much let's just say that
 struct: lol
 struct: Crosility I think most are focused on the contest
 Astrobytes: RAIC is happening 
 Crosility: Haha, okay Nerchio. I agree struct. That's what I was thinking. The contest isn't bad or anything. Just not my thing. Card games. And a "I don't know what to do - random() out" combined - made it so I quit submitting at bronze.
 Astrobytes: 7th July start
 Crosility: RAIC? (Royal Architectural Institute of Canada?)
 Nerchio: Astrobytes i saw that, might participate
 Astrobytes: No, hahaha
 Nerchio: depends on the game
 Astrobytes: Nerchio: yeah same
 Astrobytes: Crosility: Russian AI Cup
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cups.online/en/contests/coderoyale">https://cups.online/en/contests/coderoyale</a>
 Crosility: Thanks, my google results weren't giving me any context. Haha!
 Astrobytes: lol, the acronyms never end
 struct: Duck as been on rank 1 for a long time
 Astrobytes: very Duck-type contest, showed up first day too
 struct: Maybe I should submit
 Astrobytes: #1 or quit
 struct: I woudln't even start :p
 Crosility: Haha.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: an app releasr can use shoddy skills from a card that isn't required?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: yeah, but i dont think you should ever do that
 struct: ever?
 MSmits: i mean it means over half your skills are shoddy
 MSmits: &gt; 4
 struct: ah right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, that is why my prog is calculating the debt wrong
 geppoz: well you cannot know from which hand card the release takes his shoddy
 MSmits: thats also very bad
 MSmits: actually no it isnt
 MSmits: it's all discarded anyway
 geppoz: you can only know how many shoddy are needed, then it takes it from any
 struct: Is it worth ever to use cards if they wont give you anything?
 MSmits: yeah it doesnt matter, the only thing that matters is how many shoddy you are using
 geppoz: exactly
 MSmits: struct nah, just the 2 skill type cards + bonus imho
 struct: Imagine using refactoring but you have no Tech debt in hand?
 MSmits: it does nothing
 struct: what is that?
 struct: 2 kill type cards?
 struct: skill*
 MSmits: for the app
 MSmits: i misunderstood you
 MSmits: about the refactor, no there is no reason to play it for nothing
 struct: I see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I prioritize releases...if it can't be released it's still in the sort...so a debt is staying at say 3, when it could be played with 5.  When phase happens, its still at 3, dumb me, thought u had to have at least 1 card in hand of each type that is needed
 struct: I do the same for multiple
 MSmits: it's gonna go in your played and will be discarded at the end
 struct: I dont play training if I cant draw any card
 struct: It makes no difference I guess
 MSmits: good, it;s useless
 struct: Since they are all discarded
 MSmits: ye
 struct: Lots of small things I need to work on
 struct: Closing chat, ping me if its neded
 Nerchio: i hate losing to the bots that end up with 20 debt at the end of the game xd
 MSmits: going to bed
 MSmits: ignore me if i snore
 Astrobytes: lol gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :head_bandage:
 Crosility: Sigh, when compiler thinks you're doing one thing, but you're doing another. So it throws an IDE red squiggly error. But it's perfectly legal. &lt;.&lt;
 Crosility: And compiles, and functions flawlessly.
 Astrobytes: c#?
 Crosility: Basic C.
 Crosility: clang is an annoying "error checker".
 Crosility: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3524868c-bff0-4a89-8348-28df118920c6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3524868c-bff0-4a89-8348-28df118920c6</a>
 Crosility: If curious
 Astrobytes: ahhh I thought you meant the online IDE
 Astrobytes: (CG IDE)
 Crosility: No, it is. It's what they use here.
 Crosility: They use Visual Studio with clang instead of GCC. for C.
 Crosility: Fields must have a constant size: 'variable length array in structure' extension will never be supportedclang(typecheck_field_variable_size)
 Crosility: All I'm doing is using a previous declared variable, to determine size of array in a structure. Nothing dynamic. Lol.
 Astrobytes: If you can keep reproducing that you should make a report or pull request on the Monaco repo
 Astrobytes: or the clang, or both
 Crosility: I believe, from what I say, it's been fixed for a couple years now.
 Astrobytes: huh
 Crosility: I am under the suspicion CodinGame is just using a outdated version.
 Astrobytes: It was updated fairly recently since they made and had accepted a couple of PRs to the Monaco repo
 Astrobytes: *fairly*
 struct: so you think they are using msvc for intellisene?
 Crosility: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a> (sec, actually verifying against their wiki)
 Astrobytes: VSCode, ie. Monaco
 Astrobytes: and yeah, gcc not clang
 Crosility: Then .. interesting I get clang-based error reporting.
 Crosility: I'm seeing that too.
 Crosility: As it's not been an issue for GCC.
 Astrobytes: Peculiar
 Crosility: If you wanna reproduce. it's happening at as low as a level as this&#160;:
 Crosility: int w = 5;
 Crosility: struct TEST throws a IDE error/warning for "line", due to variable array size.
 Crosility: Though, it's definitely defined before test[] is created.
 struct: #define w 5
 struct: This was your error
 struct: error: variably modified â€˜lineâ€™ at file scope
 struct: If you want to look it up
 Crosility: For future reference, where did you get that error? (Since I'm compiling fine)
 struct: I ran it locally 
 struct: the c++ and C error messages are broken on cg
 Astrobytes: and it's gcc
 Astrobytes: #ifdef __GNUC__ //GCCprintf("GCC\n");
 struct: when you compile
 Astrobytes: the only alternative to #define is enum I think (good catch btw struct)
 Crosility: Interesting. It's weird, because functionally, it works. But it's throwing a "code-sense" error/IDE, not any compiler errors. But, looking up what you said, yes, I'm using a variable to define size of array in a struct.
 struct: I was getting compile error
 struct: both locally and on cg ide
 Crosility: That's weird you are - but I'm not?
 struct: or are you use c++?
 Crosility: Nope, just C.
 struct: on C it doesnt compile for me
 struct: int w = 5;struct TEST {
 struct: this code just to be sure
 struct: we are on the same page
 Crosility: Perfect.
 Nerchio: nice submit MSmits you trashed my bot :sob:
 Astrobytes: yeah, doesn't compile my end either
 struct: Nerchio it's time for revenge
 Nerchio: Still glad that I managed to break into top20 again, time to sleep
 Nerchio: cya tomorrow
 Astrobytes: aha he didn't really go to bed
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn Nerchio
 struct: Maybe he got up, I sure did yesterday to write stuff on paper
 Astrobytes: I did the same, but it was to remember to buy ginger and garlic today that I wrote down :P

 struct: oh
 struct: I thought all the time that the struct was outside main
 Crosility: No, sorry. Because then, yes, that would be outside of scope declaration.
 Astrobytes: I still get an error
 struct: not if the struct is inside the main astro
 Astrobytes: got it
 struct: Anyways I don't know why intelisense doesnt like it
 Crosility: So, now on the same page. See what I mean?
 struct: Yes
 Astrobytes: yeah, Monaco bug
 Crosility: Weird. Well, now.. is the editor color-changing in Codingame broken?
 Crosility: (Tried setting the squiggly line color coding to something less.. well, eye-sore inducing)
 struct: no idea tbh, i dont really use the cg ide
 Astrobytes: never actually tried tbh, I only use it for short puzzles or param tweaks
 struct: I run locally and use CG local
 Crosility: CG local?... 
 Astrobytes: IDE-browser bridge

 Crosility: Thanks struct, lmao. I wonder if IDE's other than Visual Studio is supported.
 jbiz: anyone else think comparing code length is a bit unfair on clash of code, considering it's comparing different languages?
 struct: you can use any ide Crosility you cant run anything locally 
 struct: it just so you dont have to copy paste the code
 Astrobytes: it just uses the file that you specify
 Astrobytes: and you can let it update based on changes or based on your consent
 pedrosorio: jbiz you can use any language you want, use short languages for shortest challenges
 Astrobytes: ^ this all day
 Astrobytes: Right tool for the right job
 struct: Master ruby and you will never lose a shortest clash again
 struct: unless someone uses bash or perl
 struct: But mastering bash and perl is much harder
 jbiz: yeah but I prefer to write in c#. I mean I can, and have written in python, but I have to look stuff up because I don't use it that often. C# however just generally has longer syntax.
 Crosility: Aw, perfect. Once I progress into some harder puzzles. I'll be 100% looking to start doing it off-site. @jbiz, totally agree. I'm a C main. It's not even a competition. I'm the loser if I do size comparisons.
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't say perl is harder, stranger maybe
 struct: Its one of the goals jbiz to make you look up stuff
 pedrosorio: jbiz learn a concise language or accept you're going to lose on the shortest challenges, that's the way it goes
 struct: you can use this cheat sheet I guess
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/siman-man/ruby-golf-style-guide">https://github.com/siman-man/ruby-golf-style-guide</a>
 struct: Anyways its time for me to go back to coding
 Crosility: This CGLocal is awesome, reading the page. I can just dump c files (or whatever file) I tested locally to the game.
 Astrobytes: yep
 Astrobytes: I use that or just copy paste from VS/whatever I'm using
 Crosility: (Non compiled, obviously), but hey, this is way better than continuously finding/editing Visual Studio and browser tweaks.
 Crosility: --&gt; Just so you know, in a few hours, I've added like 3 bookmarks from you guys giving incredible help. Thank you.
 Astrobytes: you can send compiled too but don't do that in a contest, whatever you do
 Astrobytes: yeah, chat's real useful. Shame it's going discord only
 Whoever_: Hi
 Crosility: Discord isn't bad-per say. Just this "small chat-right next to the thing you're doing" is very helpful.
 Astrobytes: Yes, easier to give direct help in context of the issue etc
 Astrobytes: And nice for shooting the sht / talking random stuff
 Astrobytes: lots of peeps can't/won't use discord though, so we're gonna lose a lot of good people
 Crosility: I wish I enjoyed this site as much as I do now, 4-5 years ago, when I initially joined.
 Astrobytes: yeah, I joined in 2015, didn't realise there were contests until 2018 lol
 Crosility: Haha. I don't remember anything about the site. But I KNOW it wasn't as user/beginner friendly before.
 Crosility: The slow-roll in quest system. To sorta "reintroduce"/set pacing.
 Astrobytes: Yeah it was a right old mess way back, before the quest map it was not the best navigation-wise but better-than-before, quest map and a few other tweaks seem to work for most people
 elderlybeginner: What's your general strategy for Green Circle?
 Crosility: Watch other people talk about it :joy:
 Astrobytes: Right now I can't say I have anything specific tbh elderlybeginner
 struct: elderlybeginner some people bruteforce all combinations
 struct: some people have heuristics
 Crosility: Well, again, it may have not been the solution I was looking for/expecting.But it's a million times better and will probably implement tomorrow. (The external IDE). Thank you again. Off for now.&#160;:]
 Astrobytes: Nice one Crosility&#160;:) See ya later!
 struct: cya
 Astrobytes: elderlybeginner: release as many apps as you can, don't get too much tech debt otherwise
 Astrobytes: about as general as I can get
 Astrobytes: currently my bot is doing the equivalent of automating technical debt :rofl:
 struct: Im going now for my V4
 elderlybeginner: I have a few ifs right now and I wonder if I even want to continue that contest
 Astrobytes: submit time?
 Astrobytes: elderlybeginner: go as far as the ifs will take you
 Astrobytes: it's kind of a love/hate contest in terms of if you like it or not I guess
 elderlybeginner: yep, certainly not in my type
 struct: its hard at the beggining but it gets better
 struct: you just need to understand the rules
 KingWhitfield2011: can somebody help me with how to play green circle
 struct: It's a very hard game KINGKRINKLES124
 KingWhitfield2011: yeah
 KingWhitfield2011: i dont really know how to play it
 Astrobytes: there are easier games/puzzles
 KingWhitfield2011: OK.thanks for your help
 struct: its not very beginner friendly imo
 struct: If you dont have experience in other multis you will struggle a lot here
 Astrobytes: Yeah, definitely not
 Westicles: don't listen to them KingWhitfield2011, they just don't want you to win their phone
 elderlybeginner: the rules are overwhelming and that's what's opposite to great contest.I prefer simple rules and deep strategy
 KingWhitfield2011: :laughing:
 KingWhitfield2011: you are funny elderlybeginner
 KingWhitfield2011: and Westicles
 Astrobytes: elderlybeginner: since it's kind of an 'unofficial' sponsored contest I feel that's okay
 Astrobytes: But the statement is fairly horrifying
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lost 70 ranks on the last sumbit, competition getting stiffer
 KingWhitfield2011: that sucks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my full move sim is bugged
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: getting stiffer? That's what she said
 PatrickMcGinnisII: back to latin IC.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :D
 KingWhitfield2011: :laughing::thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: anyway, my continued presence in the coding environment is doing me no favours, keep getting to 128-138 or miles below with every change. more bugfixing tomorrow. gn all
 KingWhitfield2011: gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nite
 bobth: Have You Guys Heard Of The Hit Game Among Us?
 KingWhitfield2011: not again
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my 15 yr old used to play it
 KingWhitfield2011: its good
 KingWhitfield2011: i hate the people who get you out even when they did it
 Westicles: hard to tell the game name with all caps
 bobth: lmao
 Westicles: My new puzzle doesn't have any 1-stars, very unusual.  Maybe wait another day
 Westicles: Maybe the power is out in france or something
 KingWhitfield2011: you r in france
 j4at: Lets make among us like game in codingame :o
 AbrahamJLR: Can someone guide me to transform an exercise that recently came out in clashofcode and I managed to finish in an inefficient way in my opinion?
 KingWhitfield2011: group project
 bobth: j4at yooo ill make a CoC
 j4at: nice, I'm talking about bot programming tho. 8  players among us game. That will be very sick.
 bobth: oh oh 
 bobth: I'll still make one anyways
 j4at: good luck&#160;:)
 bobth: rhanks
 bobth: t
 KingWhitfield2011: can you do team projects'

 jbiz: how long's it gonna take me? a million years?
 jbiz: i can't access the other milestones without doing this one&#160;:/
 Westicles: clash rank decays if you stop playing. you are probably competing with 4k people and 7/8 of them are 11 year-olds 
 jbiz: right o

 jbiz: so i've a ways to go
 Westicles: that's contest rank, you are talking about the clash achievement?
 dickhead3: can someone teach me how to code
 antiwonto: [auto] hey dickhead3 looking for some intro tutorials on programming?  This isn't the place probably.  Try codecademy.com , 'The Coding Train' on youtube, or first levels in codewars.com

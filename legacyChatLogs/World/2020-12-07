 PatrickMcGinnisII: is it cold there?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's 16C here, bout the same?
 Rockstar555: couldn't understand
 Rockstar555: :thinking:
 Rockstar555: ohh
 Rockstar555: yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 61 farenheit
 Rockstar555: 9 c
 Rockstar555: 9C
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i love it, better than 40C

 MadKnight: so my PC headphones are doing weird noises instead of the actual sound
 MadKnight: how do i tell if it's a software bug or hardware&#160;?
 MadKnight: okay i'm pretty sure it's a software bug
 MadKnight: how do i fix it, Automaton2000? everything works when i plug these headphones into my phone
 Automaton2000: i was just thinking how to solve the problem.
 MadKnight: JBM
 JBM: MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight
 MadKnight: JBM JBM JBM
 JBM: MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight MadKnight
 MadKnight: let's continue our little convo here JBM
 JBM: where would that stop
 MadKnight: instead of fr
 MadKnight: so about what i was saying
 JBM: we had a convo?
 JBM: was mostly you naming me
 MadKnight: yea i was saying stuff and u were responding
 JBM: i'm so polite
 MadKnight: but i wasn't saying it in fr so we are here
 MadKnight: i actually just wanted to know your age JBM
 MadKnight: are u older than uljahn&#160;?
 JBM: i don't know
 JBM: how old am I?
 MadKnight: answer your own question
 MadKnight: do it for Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i knew you were going to do that for the last year
 JBM: Automaton2000 is about 4 years old
 Automaton2000: i think this will help me
 MadKnight: do it for the last year as Automaton2000 says
 Automaton2000: that's where i found out why my code doesn't work for me
 MadKnight: his code was supposed to get the answer but it didn't wor
 MadKnight: k
 MadKnight: so here he are JBM
 JBM: maybe if u try again
 MadKnight: okay let's do it again Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but my bot is just better than mine
 JBM: says it all
 MadKnight: what does
 JBM: true master of self-reference
 MadKnight: wut
 MadKnight: too context-ish
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 explain the context
 Automaton2000: that's what i told you to do a bfs from each cell to each other
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 hack into JBM's mind and find out what he got in mind, and also find out his age
 Automaton2000: u need to check if a pac is dead
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Drain Bamage
 MadKnight: i hope it's not that joke from 2016 about me being an Automaton2000 Automaton2000 because it's too old and outdated
 Automaton2000: and i'm pretty sure you can get the distance from the checkpoint
 MadKnight: PatrickMcGinnisII are u talking about that song by Eminem&#160;?
 MadKnight: where he rhymed to Orange&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 just said JBM has brain damage
 Automaton2000: need some help with the ascii art puzzle?
 MadKnight: JBM is a pac&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess
 JBM: now that's old
 JBM: but is it old enough
 PatrickMcGinnisII: JBM did u have a contrib just go live?
 MadKnight: true, that song is old
 JBM: not that i know why?
 JBM: then again i don't think i logged in to check today
 MadKnight: JBM is just a passive troll who chills in chat and trolls people PatrickMcGinnisII his only activity is approving puzzles
 MadKnight: oh and also repeating jokes from 2016
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if u did just wanted to know the name of it, thought i saw one yesterday with 13 hours left er sumtin
 MadKnight: (2016 is the year of CSB)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Actually I'm practicing variations of deep cloning class objects, there is no spoon ep 2 has been kicking my buttocks
 MadKnight: (and also the year where i was a bit weird and jbm made a meme out of me doing very weird french sentences in #fr)
 MadKnight: why do u need any kind of fancy deep cloning for that one PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php doesn't copy nodes correctly
 MadKnight: oh so is that your only problem&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so u have to manually write __clone functions
 MadKnight: fixing deep cloning -&gt; pt2 is solved&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: almost
 MadKnight: xplain
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my dfs tree was operating on bad data
 PatrickMcGinnisII: old data
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when i backtrack the objects by reference had only 1 copy.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so i think that works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and although CG upgraded the php core, it's still full of errors involving the use of constants
 PatrickMcGinnisII: define('CONSTANT',[]);
 PatrickMcGinnisII: arrays works, but if you try to copy the data , CG doesn't error it as constants can't be pass by reference... which it should error, but doesn't
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so a workaround with a static class is necessary
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it just sucks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for example, if I setup a library of combinatorics for my program to use, so i don't have to compute them everytime
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it saves cpu cycles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but as soon as you try to use one in a foreach loop in a node tree class they freaking barf on themselves
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's so wierd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: weird
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I assume CG is scared of recursive error checking
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's better than nothing, which is basically what a standard php cli gives you...nothing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok tmi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Haven't tried PHP in any IDEs, althouhg i have a couple that are capable

 hiukan: is there anything I have to do/click to actually participate in a clash of code ..&#160;? I'm a little bit confused because all I see is a timer to 0 and then... well nothing happens (?)
 DoxLee: can somebody help me who knows c++
 jacek: hiukan in the page there is join a clash, then wait till timer is 0 and you should be moved to page with clash task
 K2ARISM: it's broken
 jacek: oO
 logiqub: clash isnt' starting for me, stuck at the join screen
 logiqub: count down and then freeze, anyone with the same problem&#160;?
 jacek: hmm
 hiukan: yeah here
 hiukan: that's what I mean
 hiukan: meant
 jacek: reported bug in discord
 Matt9400: ok
 K2ARISM: it's working now
 logiqub: Still totally broken for me. Although it did update that I lost 500 places and probably losing more as I try to join.
 hiukan: what's working for me is taking the link in the upper right corner and just put this in the "adressleiste" sorry I don't know how it's called in english
 hiukan: well just where you put in your urls /webadresses
 hiukan: top of browser
 logiqub: okay thank you @hiukan
 hiukan: np&#160;:)

 Leirn: Hello. I have a question on Chess board analyzer
 Leirn: It seems that the test "Close one" violates the rule "An attacked King could be saved only by moving himself to a safe square (not by using another piece from the King's team)"
 Leirn: Because the test is expteting a non terminal game, but the white king is definitely mat is I cannot use the white knight

 Rockstar555: see this
 Uljahn: just go to discord [solved]
 Uljahn: xmpp chats cant have such functionality i guess
 struct: Leirn the king is not in check
 struct: oh wait
 struct: yeah doesnt seem on check
 struct: But all surrounding cells are covered by enemy
 Leirn: ohhhh
 struct: But he can still move his Knight
 Leirn: Thanks for the nuance
 Rockstar555: hey anybody here
 jacek: AutomatonNN maybe
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 [CG]Maxime: Uljahn it's actually possible: we store the messages in a postgresql database, so it's possible to update the messages there. However, it's not in the protocole directly, so it's kind of hacky.
 [CG]Maxime: (and the message would not be removed from the chat for people who received it in their client)
 DJBioPanda_fa3c: Somebody done stall tilt puzzle?
 Uljahn: [CG]Maxime: right, thanks for the detailed response
 ProCrazyCoder: HELLO

 Lafihalas: guys, for bulls and cows puzzle, what should be the output if its not possible to uniquely pinpoint the secret number from all the guesses
 eulerscheZahl: then you should check your solver as it's always possible to find a unique number
 Lafihalas: oh ok, all cases in IDE passed, and one of the validators called "All for naught" failed, so you know, i had to ask :D
 Lafihalas: thanks i will go recheck my solution
 Lafihalas: btw i managed to find the error on my side, thanks again :D
 cerklee: hello
 miszu: when you finish first with 25.76 but the boss is 25.81 and you won vs bot 4/5...
 miszu: cruel world
 jacek: nyoro~n
 MatieLeFilm: yes
 Stilgart: miszu: time to submit again
 jacek: woo new puzzle of the week
 trictrac: hello jacek, it's blocking
 jacek: talk to mods to unlock it
 wlesavo: hello blocking :slight_smile:
 miszu: Stilgart yeah I submitted again with a small change and now in silver
 struct: nice miszu
 miszu: thank you!
 jacek: lets see how many new players will be there
 PeaceMoreZ: hi
 Stilgart: gg miszu
 ToshiTuringMachine: woow this puzzle of the week is so cool
 ToshiTuringMachine: i think I will buy the real game
 Guinsoo: I played it as school it's great
 therealbeef: urgh, why did i think that optional&lt;vector&lt;..&gt;&gt; a = {} would create an optional with empty vector in it. stupid bug -_-
 ToshiTuringMachine: well the middle player in a 3 players game is pretty unlucky
 struct: Site slow again?
 DomiKo: yes&#160;:(
 LastRick: Must be that time of night again
 LastRick: Gotta update them leaderboards
 FuriousTurtle: sorry i'm compiling some scala, i'll refactor so the website doesnt freeze ~~
 LastRick: I joked last night its because I'm hooked on CSB. I cant get enough.
 struct: Oh well, I reported it yesterday on discord
 struct: I guess we just have to wait
 LastRick: Holy moley its creeping right now
 LastRick: Ugh, stuck around top 15% of Gold on CSB. Just can not find that last trick. 
 MadKnight: boost with one pod on start
 MadKnight: this trick is even better than -3vel
 LastRick: it makes some sense. there are times at the start of a race it is like bumper cars
 MadKnight: boost on start is sometimes very useful and sometimes not
 MadKnight: it's like 100% will be useful for one of the pods
 LastRick: i also think there's something left to calculate with the shape of the track.  when the turn is fairly obtuse, the pods do ok. When the turn is acute, I definitely dont stop as well as the bot
 MadKnight: u need to do like real racers do
 LastRick: I need a brake!&#160;:)
 MadKnight: no u need to lean to the right side
 MadKnight: before turning left
 LastRick: yeah, apply an offset based on if its to the left or right
 MadKnight: yea
 LastRick: lest i forget what was the -3vel thing, didnt get that
 MadKnight: oh it was just nextCpX - vx*3
 LastRick: weird. i dont get the math of that
 MadKnight: your pod moves in +vx
 MadKnight: your pod aims directly towards target which is nextCpX 
 MadKnight: and accelerates
 MadKnight: but then it gets pushed by vx
 MadKnight: so its aim is no more directed towards nextCpX
 MadKnight: but instead towards nextCpX + vx
 LastRick: Sure, thats why I usually adjust by -vx for my command. It's the "3" I dont understand
 MadKnight: your vx doesn't disappear instantly
 MadKnight: it keeps
 LastRick: oh interesting. like it takes time to decelerate
 MadKnight: like in 2 turns it'll be nextCpX + vx*2
 LastRick: oh wow. that may be it. my pods look really good right now
 MadKnight: gogogo ezpz legend
 LastRick: Seriously thanks for your help. Testing it now, nearly undefeated through the first 30%. Even if i dont make legend, it was obviously tons better 
 DaNinja: next just add a neural net genetic algorithm
 DaNinja: ezpz legend
 LastRick: that's exactly what i'm trying NOT to do
 LastRick: Holy wow. That jumped me all the way to top 75 Gold. So close, @MadKnight.
 MadKnight: do u start going towards future nextCP early&#160;?
 LastRick: yeah, I bank. But now I will probably revisit my banking seeing how it's turning a lot better now
 MadKnight: u need to somehow improve your condition of when to "bank"
 LastRick: Oh yeah, definitely. I think thats the last hurdle to legend, when to bank + a slight offset to the bank
 MadKnight: u can calculate movement 
 MadKnight: pos += vel
 MadKnight: to check if it hits checkpoint in a few turns
 MadKnight: LastRick
 LastRick: In other words, if I start banking "now", would it stop before getting there? if so, don't bank yet
 MadKnight: like, would it miss checkpoint&#160;?
 LastRick: yeah
 MadKnight: yea check for it
 LastRick: Interesting. this feels like some math coming on.&#160;:)
 MadKnight: some basic gamedev math 
 LastRick: for you guys, this is all new to me. Never done anything remotely like this. 
 MadKnight: u just need some operations with vectors
 LastRick: yeah, i got work to do it would seem

 jaHSHuaBRu: First timer here.. coding in Python. Embarrassed to say it but seeing other peoples solutions is first ive heard of F#!
 jaHSHuaBRu: had to google it... lol
 jaHSHuaBRu: why are more people not using Python?
 therealbeef: it makes me itchy&#160;;-)
 therealbeef: and performance
 Wontonimo: lots of people do use python jaHSHuaBRu
 Wontonimo: LOTS of people
 Wontonimo: it is a very popular language with a lot of support and lots of jobs
 Wontonimo: it just doesn't do well here in the multiplayer bot competitions
 Wontonimo: because of what therealbeef said about performance

 Dreuyasha: is there any communities where noob programmers can interact?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: can i interact?
 Automaton2000: where do i need some help
 mub2l6: I need a help
 BlaiseEbuth: I need coffee
 5DN1L: You need CoffeeScript
 C26_1: #PrivateChat
 C26_1: You could use, #[name] to make your chat for others
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't say horrors like this 5DN1L! :scream:
 C26_1: @BlaiseEbuth
 C26_1: Are you online now?
 C26_1: I need your test
 BlaiseEbuth: What?
 C26_1: Click the yellow text "PrivateChat"
 C26_1: I don't know if this is make a chat
 BlaiseEbuth: It does. #knack open a chan
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: But can we chat normally like in World chat?
 C26_1: I don't see you chat in #PrivateChat chat
 BlaiseEbuth: Because I didn't opened it... ^^
 C26_1: Ah ok
 C26_1: So, #[name] to make a chat for your friends
 C26_1: Bye Bye, I'm gonna do something
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. But you can use /join name too
 C26_1: That'll make you go to the chat directly
 BlaiseEbuth: Just opening a new chat tab
 emergenitro: Hellooo
 Katespizer: hi
 smallDick: hey niggers
 smallDick: whats popping
 smallDick: guys
 5DN1L: smallDick First warning. Please mind your language, or you'll be kicked out.
 ASM_MOV_INT: ...first glance at this chat, and I thought 5DN1L was the one needing a warning....! lol
 5DN1L: I hope people don't come up with even worse names
 Katespizer: what in the world possibly could be worse than having smallDick
 5DN1L: Don't even start this discussion
 C26_1: So, people with unappropriate names should be banned, right?
 5DN1L: I guess so
 C26_1: or at least tell them to change their name
 Uljahn: yeah, such people're clearly not interested in coding, so showing them the way out is a favour for the community
 Nachosauce: But what defines inappropriate? Perhaps smalldick refers to a food, like spotted dick. We live in a weird world
 5DN1L: I don't care if he's describing himself
 Oppaimaster: bebus
 bebus: what
 bebus: b e b u s
 Oppaimaster: bEBuS
 5DN1L: Don't spam, guys
 Nachosauce: I love you guys. I'm trying to decide if I should do the mars lander optimization one for a medal, or some hard puzzles for a medal
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, should Nachosauce do the mars lander optimization or some hard puzzles?
 Automaton2000: i want to make the code so i can start with a very high level
 Wontonimo: mars 3 is a hard puzzle
 Wontonimo: so, best of both worlds&#160;: still on mars, and hard puzzle
 5DN1L: Rarely see you at this hour of the day, Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: i'm rarely up at 5am
 Wontonimo: only because i'm still up
 5DN1L: oh
 Wontonimo: it's too early to wake up
 Nachosauce: I wake up at 4:30 to work on codingame and exercise before work. It's a terrible way to live.
 ASM_MOV_INT: clash of code wakes up my coding brain
 ASM_MOV_INT: anytime of day or night
 Blabbage: I am trying to create a contribution. Fiddling with the stub generator i want an output somewhat like this in python: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a54b7c2f-9dc6-43c9-8ccb-22d15f6cf5f9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a54b7c2f-9dc6-43c9-8ccb-22d15f6cf5f9</a>
 Blabbage: Also i want some good way of reading this input: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2a2de71e-811f-422b-a34c-3eb18d846f4f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2a2de71e-811f-422b-a34c-3eb18d846f4f</a>
 5DN1L: Blabbage Check out other contributions which may give you an idea of how to write the stub generator, e.g. this one may be doing what you want? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/44234bafac22aabe005455fa4dead0136e9b">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/44234bafac22aabe005455fa4dead0136e9b</a>
 Blabbage: Thanks
 Blabbage: Ok, nice solved my first problem
 5DN1L: :D
 Blabbage: with variable length space separated input, I will just supply the string in the same way you do with the rows...
 Blabbage: thx
 C26_1: And I want to make my contribution has many tests as possible
 C26_1: avoid hardcoding
 C26_1: Why would some guys just hardcoding somethings that's so easy
 C26_1: Wait for me
 C26_1: I'm gonna change the condition required in the contribution
 C26_1: cuz the output so redundant
 C26_1: Given a positive number <a href="/index.php?title=N&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="N (page does not exist)">N</a> in decimal, print all the numbers in decimal that satified all conditions below:- Each numbers have the number of digit '1' the same as <a href="/index.php?title=N&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="N (page does not exist)">N</a> when converted to binary- The value of that number must larger than the input
 5DN1L: C26_1 Please do not flood this chat with details of your contribution, thanks.

 BlaiseEbuth: 5DN1L: I already told you that a good chat is one where all the users are already banned.
 5DN1L: ok, let's start with you :D
 Nachosauce: :joy: well damn
 Alshock: o/ BlaiseEbuth &lt;3
 BlaiseEbuth: :flushed:
 BlaiseEbuth: \o Alshock :hugging:
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: Everyone
 C26_1: Have everyone heard of some hot news
 C26_1: Microsoft has buy Activision
 5DN1L: not "has bought"
 5DN1L: the transaction has not been completed yet
 C26_1: Ah, I forgot
 C26_1: But if the transaction is complete (Maybe for many next years) then it'll be the "biggest" transaction ever (I must put the word biggest in quote in case there's a transaction that's even bigger)
 Alshock: Well "has bought" is not entirely false, the claim is always made before all technical detials are dealt with
 Nachosauce: There was a $183B transaction in 1999
 C26_1: @Nachosauce, ok so it's not the biggest, it's just the most recent
 Alshock: the most recent transaction ever? That's gonna need more quotes than "biggest"
 C26_1: And I found that the price is 68,7 billion$
 C26_1: Let me check the search-wird "Microsoft buy Activision" in Google Trend
 C26_1: word*
 Mulberg2009: some one got discord
 C26_1: After some minutes, I found out that the keyword is most viral at 18/01/2022, 22:00 and SIngapore is by far the country that has the most search that are related to the keyword
 C26_1: But it drops a lot since
 5DN1L: You mean "keyword" is the most searched keyword?
 C26_1: keyword here is "microsoft buy activision blizzard"
 C26_1: And that's why I've never heard of someone else talking about this news until.... I don't know, I'm easy to forgot
 Alshock: no offense but no one really care about your analysis of the deal's buzz
 C26_1: yea
 Uljahn: still lvl 9, eh? seems you like to annoy people with off-topic more than solving puzzles :slight_smile:
 Alshock: Well, that applies to me as well xD
 5DN1L: that applies to Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how do you like challenges?
 WillChang: ok Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yes but it will make a bot that has a good bot
 WillChang: ah ,I see, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: took me too long to realize that i have already solved the puzzle of the week

 AveragePythonEnjoyer: Well, as for me it seems kind of cheating if it is used in code golf.
 Uljahn: using language features is cheating :scream_cat:
 AveragePythonEnjoyer: No, but he didn't write that code by himself. He just generated it. It's like copy-pasting the solution.
 bonsaifree: how do you read problem, find the solution and copy pasta it in 20 seconds?
 bonsaifree: didn't he just wrote a few lines and submitted?
 AveragePythonEnjoyer: Writing this by hand is impossible
 Uljahn: clash pool is finite, so there's a chance of repetition
 Uljahn: solve it once, then copy-paste the solution
 bonsaifree: wow, okey
 bonsaifree: still it is impressive that he found the proper answer and finish in 20 seconds
 bonsaifree: my best was 35 seconds, but an easy problem
 Uljahn: i think it could be automated with a user-script or a browser extension

 5DN1L: :rolling_eyes:
 Wontonimo: you know i'm bored when ...
 5DN1L: now I know
 5DN1L: Wontonimo maybe you wanna read a comment to your puzzle on the forum? That may relieve you of your boredom
 derjack: what puzzle
 5DN1L: Wave Function Collapse
 derjack: read forums on the current potw. they proved the draw and there is 1 crash
 Wontonimo: thanks ... checking wfc now
 BlaiseEbuth: Pow these days... 
 Wontonimo: found it.  Thanks 5DN1L
 5DN1L: My pleasure&#160;:)
 ninjadip: if(bored) {//TODO... }

 ninjadip: just started this mars lander.. fun fun
 5DN1L: Expect to crash often :upside_down:
 Wontonimo: ninjadip, which one? 1,2,3 or opti?
 ninjadip: i think it's starting me on the second one
 Wontonimo: don't skip mars 1
 ninjadip: yeah, i see it now, it says second level
 ninjadip: why
 ninjadip: this is where my chart has taken me
 5DN1L: why do mars 1 when you can do mars 2 lol
 ninjadip: says i don't need to do first
 Wontonimo: X and Y are actually quite different.  Mars 1 lets you improve Y before really having divide your attention
 ninjadip: oh
 ninjadip: which one lets you smoke astroturf
 ninjadip: ok i'm on the first one now

 Fasader: :snake: attack
 ninjadip: tell mne about it
 ninjadip: ahh no more snakes or snakes on planes
 Fasader: effortless learning :D
 5DN1L: If you don't want to read, you can still choose to watch YouTube videos which teach programming
 ninjadip: yep
 5DN1L: But some just want to be spoon-fed...
 ninjadip: just thinking, do they have a game where you code a bot to do the old "snake"/"worm" game? like where you keep getting bigger and  not eat yourself
 5DN1L: they mean CG? i think there is
 ninjadip: yes
 ninjadip: oh cool
 5DN1L: i think it's Line Racing
 jacek: there was WIP snake contribution long time ago
 ninjadip: line racing is not it
 ninjadip: oh cool
 5DN1L: Line Racing is not it because you don't have to bite any apples? :thinking:
 ninjadip: no because it's not it at all
 ninjadip: it's more about a set area and not killing yourself more than trying to kill anyone else
 ninjadip: getting bigger but not infinite
 5DN1L: ah, ok
 ninjadip: i can see in the coding world, having a great pattern that lets you get as big as possible without turning in on yourself

 Wontonimo: sure
 Wontonimo: hi
 Wontonimo: first , what kind of problem are you looking to solve with variable length chromosomes&#160;?
 JavaliMZ: Hello. I can try to pass certifications multiple times?
 struct: I think you need to wait 30 days after you complete it
 struct: to try again for the same language
 JavaliMZ: ok =) That was very fast response!! tanks
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't worry. You'll be better than &gt;99% of the pros too.
 jacek: if everyone is &gt;99%, who is &lt;99%?
 foxforfoxes: can you learn coding here?
 foxforfoxes: like HTML coding
 foxforfoxes: i cant learn javascript until i do
 jacek: html isnt programming language :v
 foxforfoxes: oh lol
 foxforfoxes: so i guess ill just keep doing javascript
 jacek: you can do other languages
 foxforfoxes: i think ill try python
 foxforfoxes: is it weird i'm 9 and i'm programming
 struct: whats weird about that?
 struct: ah the language
 struct: python is fine
 foxforfoxes: ha thanks and im gonna try
 BlaiseEbuth: 'python is fine' :scream:
 foxforfoxes: what?
 5DN1L: ignore BlaiseEbuth, he's the weird guy :upside_down:
 foxforfoxes: is ccs a programming language tho and thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: struct say 'python is fine' and I'm the weirdo...
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course, css is turing complete.
 foxforfoxes: oh
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: as far as I can tell, the french hate python because stupid people can use it to solve difficult problems
 foxforfoxes: so? im nine
 foxforfoxes: i kinda need to do it
 foxforfoxes: or learn html
 foxforfoxes: dont know javascript yet
 foxforfoxes: i need to use html to learn javascript
 5DN1L: foxforfoxes This website is for more for practising than learning. You'd better go elsewhere to learn the basics of a programming language and come back here later to practise
 jacek: struct any breakthrough in your bt stuff?
 foxforfoxes: idk where to go to do this stuff
 foxforfoxes: im in school right now so i cant ask my parents to do anything
 5DN1L: foxforfoxes google "learn html", "learn javascript", "learn css"
 foxforfoxes: true i could do that
 foxforfoxes: but im trying to do python
 foxforfoxes: i already looked that up to
 Quidome: This one maybe:
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tynker.com/languages/javascript">https://www.tynker.com/languages/javascript</a>

 foxforfoxes: do you know any others?
 Lagal3re: hello every body&#160;! somebody could tell me how a char[4][4] could change with different length without asking it. And I finished with a first line at 7 caracter, 2nd line at 3 caracteres and 3rd line at 6 caracteres&#160;?
 Quidome: c?
 Lagal3re: yes
 Quidome: are you using this array as strings?
 Quidome: If I am correct c uses 0 terminated strings if you are not correctly terminating it will just go on until it finds a zero
 Lagal3re: yes i think in my case i well initilised it with 3 char + 1 for '\0' but then i update with strcpy function and i think my table is broken at this moment  
 Quidome: You can overwrite the zero with a character you got the behaviour you describe as a result
 Lagal3re: hmmm ok i understand i'll check that thank you
 Quidome: the strcpy will not look for a zero while copying just copy until finished and than place a zero
 Lagal3re: actually, i am copying a table char in an other one with both same init
 Quidome: can you share your code?
 Lagal3re: in the chat&#160;?
 Quidome: No
 Quidome: there  is another trick see it happening all the time
 Quidome: don't know how to do it&#160;:(
 Quidome: well got to go, you can probably figure this one out now&#160;:) gl

 rectile: hola soy nuevo aqui
 rectile: soy rectilineo
 rectile: pero diganme rectile
 Thorcode: please speak english
 rectile: use the translator
 rectile: and put spanish
 Thorcode: orr easier use auto detec
 rectile: truth xd
 rectile: I don't speak much in English
 ASM_MOV_INT: so in clash of code, if you get 100% in the tests, but the hidden tests give you a lesser percent, should you report that as an issue?  I always do
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: some test they could troll you
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 ASM_MOV_INT: but other players get 100%, so i'm just like... reported!
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 Thorcode: can someone help me to find the index of the first max value in the list?  
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: check their code
 Thorcode: and you should read the goal of the clash carefully ASM_MOV_INT
 Thorcode: some of them could have special rule
 ASM_MOV_INT: hmmm... something to think about, but yeah
 therealbeef: I think it's good to report, because the test cases apparently don't cover the requirements. although if it's a reverse engineering type clash, then the maker doesn't want to give too many hints obviously
 postrelV8: why im not in the next golden league for around 2 days, i beat all of silver league and my place in leaderboard above boss
 Thorcode: not really, most clash I meet I often read the goal too fast and forgot their special rule in the test case I usually got 100% but the test I got lower
 ASM_MOV_INT: see it just happened, I received 100% on all tests, then 50% on total with hidden....
 ASM_MOV_INT: reverse mode
 therealbeef: postrelV8 did you wait until your bot finished 100% of its games?
 ASM_MOV_INT: I think they should allow clash of code to be tried (submitted at 15 minutes fine), but continue to try indefinitely as an option... some problems I want to continue to try if I've been working feverishly for 15 minutes....
 postrelV8: i waited fo 24 hours after ranking
 therealbeef: without resubmitting?
 ASM_MOV_INT: yes
 ASM_MOV_INT: resubmitting after 15 minutes.... shouldn't be allowed, unless they make like two types of clashes per each clash, one 15 minutes, and one post 15 minutes lol
 ASM_MOV_INT: and sharing code, shouldn't be optional
 rectile: oye porque solo hablan de el juego
 postrelV8: therealbeef, now im remaching
 ASM_MOV_INT: if you score 100%, code is shared automatically
 rectile: prestenme aencion
 Thorcode: bruh postrelV8 just patient, 
 Thorcode: They need time to check if your score below the bot XD 
 postrelV8: HOW MANY
 Thorcode: like other player submit again then him beat you
 Thorcode: up to the league
 Thorcode: gold often 4-6 or more
 postrelV8: but why there is that note:Those better than the Boss will be promoted to Gold League at 05 H 52
 therealbeef: It should be quick. usually you get the notification that you will be promoted within a minute of finishing all battles and being above the boss. Then the wait to actually be promoted can vary but there should show a countdown at the top of the screen
 postrelV8: i bet the bos
 ASM_MOV_INT: they should have a screen for clash of code statistics, like total clashes, clashes per day, most positive reviewed in each category, etc. that'd be cool
 C26_1: Oh hello everyone
 C26_1: I have thinking about patterns in binary numbers
 C26_1: Like the set of numbers that contain 2 digit '1' in binary
 C26_1: {3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 17...}
 C26_1: I don't see any patterns yet
 C26_1: The set of numbers than contain 1 digit '1' in binary has pattern though
 C26_1: The pattern is 2^n - 1
 C26_1: Where n is cardinal number, 1st, 2nd, 3rd,...

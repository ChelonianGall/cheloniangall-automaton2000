 NinjaDoggy: the top 3 bots in breakthrough have a very interesting dynamic:100% winrate vs everyone, except 0% winrate vs the bots ranked higher
 NinjaDoggy: just how high is the skill ceiling in breakthrough ._.
 derjack: look at reCurse. this is the ceiling
 dbdr: martinpapa69 seems to be in submit 24/7 for a week on oware&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: ye i add "groundbreaking" improvements pretty often to my code, that i must submit asap
 derjack: instant gratification generation :unamuased:
 derjack: :unamused:
 martinpapa69: ye.. gamer brain
 LennyPhoenix: bebus
 martinpapa69: but now I think I made something that actually works. wrote a script, that runs a local TrueSkill "server" with my bots, and finds wich one is the strongest 
 DB124: beebuus
 derjack: as long as you push me up
 dbdr: unlikely derjack
 dbdr: martinpapa69: that's nice, but not sure it means much on the leaderboard
 martinpapa69: ye i wasnt sure either, but it looks like it works
 martinpapa69: not that it improved my rank, but it dont have to submit 20 versions manually
 martinpapa69: I*
 dbdr: CG servers thank you!
 derjack: no! you paid for CG servers, then use all of the CG servers
 Marchete: what ground breaking changes,  martinpapa69?
 martinpapa69: I actually submit after every small change i do. but I have some more serious changes. what I actually improved I think is changing hashing and mpoving to alpha-zero-like training. all other stuff i did, just removing parts I didnt like
 derjack: whats alpha-zero-like training in this context
 martinpapa69: I basically jsut train a single NN with replays generated by itself. very simple.
 derjack: so no pitting
 martinpapa69: no pitting
 derjack: :3
 martinpapa69: but ye still need something to find the best state of the NN, because its not the most recent one usually
 martinpapa69: one thing is interesting, that the top10 of my local trueskill-run is from all around the timeline
 Marchete: hmm
 Marchete: I don't know I see it a bit weird
 martinpapa69: im actually not surprised, but ye its strange
 martinpapa69: models\20210721-184320 trueskill.Rating(mu=45.276, sigma=3.237)models\20210721-133603 trueskill.Rating(mu=45.619, sigma=3.016)models\20210721-113809 trueskill.Rating(mu=47.117, sigma=2.852)models\20210721-164732 trueskill.Rating(mu=49.360, sigma=2.165)
 martinpapa69: uhh I thought it will go to a paste, sry
 derjack: :rage:
 martinpapa69: :innocent:
 sangokuhomer: Does clashofcode see when we are just printing the result?
 vulkanino: how can I  see the input of a test case?
 KiwiTae: vulkanino u can print them on stderr
 vulkanino: gosh! didn't think about that! thanks
 DaNinja: or click the Show Testcases menu button
 derjack: but clash of code shows the test cases in description :thinking:
 Marchete: then why it's good to play from latest model, martinpapa69?
 Marchete: it could be well into some local optimum
 martinpapa69: ye, dunno. I might not be the best way. 
 martinpapa69: maybe I'l ltry to combine this trueskill stuff with the training script
 Marchete: then suddenly you have pit matches, congrats!
 martinpapa69: :joy:
 martinpapa69: It's actually not a bad idea. I simulate a submit locally of the lastest model. and on the sample generation I prefer models with higher trueskill score. It should add more variety
 derjack: you have a pool of models. use GA to breed new ones :o
 martinpapa69: crossover between the bits, of the compressed model&#160;?
 derjack: between the weights or parts of weights
 martinpapa69: I think if you'd do something like that your model would just collapse
 derjack: incest is wincest
 martinpapa69: man of culture
 tduck973564: i forgor :skull:
 Marchete: I'd random pick models based on winrates
 Marchete: a weighted pick
 KiwiTae: breeding nns works well
 KiwiTae: just gotta also keep strongest fits in the pool
 KiwiTae: and some randoms like Marchete says worked well for me&#160;:/
 martinpapa69: ye I'd do something like that, make a  probability of the trueskill score of the model
 Fijo:  hey guys
 dbdr: mu and sigma give you a probability distribution
 dbdr: breeding nns sounds like a shame, replacing a principled gradient method with random changes
 martinpapa69: ye sigma could be used too somehow i guess
 Fijo: can someone help me?
 derjack: with?
 dbdr: what's your problem Fijo?
 Astrobytes: Guess he fell down the well
 KiwiTae: o/
 KiwiTae: send him a rope

 derjack: nn checkers trained via evolution <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie24">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie24</a>
 Illedan: Damn, that training gotta be slow
 Marchete: on what game, Illedan?
 derjack: its from 1999 with reasonable time
 Illedan: The wikipedia
 Illedan: Training the weights with evolution
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: from 2002
 Marchete: so it's a bit old
 Marchete:  any modern NN bot can beat it, I guess
 Illedan: I wonder how big the network was
 dbdr: the algorithm for efficient backpropagation in deep networks is relatively recent, isn't it?
 Illedan: I tried to evolve weights for TTT that way, but it struggled bigtime. Guess I had a bad way of evolving
 dbdr: part of the reason we got out of the AI winter
 Marchete: "and eventually in obtaining a victory against a dumbed-down version of Chinook."
 Marchete: ok that doesn't sound good
 Illedan: :D

 Marchete: maybe at that time it was an achievement
 Marchete: 31% vs checkers players..
 Marchete: I feel the urge to write a book about how I reached 900th place on Spring 2021 chanllenge
 dbdr: again, not a science achivement. you can see from the program, they polished the package, played on the fantasy of AI
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: I guess the book is written for the general public
 Illedan: 5/7 would read that book
 Marchete: science fiction AI, written to scare old ladies

 Illedan: Astrobytes, should snake be about filling the board fastest with many moves a step or about collecting the most food in 600 steps?
 Astrobytes: Hm, I'd say food off the top of my head but tough call
 dbdr: 2p snake?
 Illedan: Snake optim
 Illedan: Not tron style, but normal
 dbdr: :scream:
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8462468ed0113b37c6abb9f1a25ad764b388cc">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8462468ed0113b37c6abb9f1a25ad764b388cc</a>
 Illedan: I made this for a friend a long time ago
 Illedan: but I'll make it into an Optim later today
 Illedan: Just not sure what the goal should be
 dbdr: if you get more food, you grow faster, no?
 Illedan: Sure
 dbdr: so how do the the two differ?
 Illedan: But the goal could be to move 1 tile every frame with goal to get the most food in 600 frames. Or multiple moves like 2048 and fill the board fastest
 struct: multiple moves only if its single player right?
 Illedan: Yesh
 Illedan: I wont make it a multi
 Illedan: too equal to Tron imo
 Illedan: Optim seems more fun
 dbdr: maybe multiple moves will lead to more depth
 Illedan: Yeah, I think so too
 dbdr: literally and as an optim
 Astrobytes: yes, I think you're right
 Thyl: Why I get an acess for all elements of a queue of STL c++
 Thyl:&#160;???
 struct: what do you mean?
 Thyl: queue&lt;int&gt; q;
 Thyl: for(int i=0;i&lt;10;i++){q.push(9);}
 Thyl: for(int i=0;i&lt;10;i++){cout&lt;&lt;q[i]&lt;&lt;endl;}
 Thyl: for example
 Astrobytes: pop()
 Thyl: I want to my elements are in my queue qfter the cout
 Astrobytes: q.front(); q.pop();
 RoboStac: you can't use a queue then, the whole point is you can only access the first element and add to the end
 Thyl: ok
 Thyl: Thanks&#160;!
 Astrobytes: use a deque  or list or something
 RoboStac: dequeue would probably work
 Thyl: It was for debuging
 RoboStac: or just a vector if you don't actually want to pop elements
 Astrobytes: Yeah, your purpose is unclear here
 Thyl: it's for a BFS
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c43ddde1-1370-4367-a1e7-ec1119fe1154">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c43ddde1-1370-4367-a1e7-ec1119fe1154</a>
 Thyl: Thanks Astrobytes
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: strange to have two functions. pop could just return the element, that's a very common usage
 dbdr: and the compiler can optimize if you don't use it
 dbdr: rust version:while let Some(currentNode) = q.pop() { ... }
 Astrobytes: C++ innit :P
 dbdr: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

 Astrobytes: I use an array if I need speed

 Astrobytes: Another meeting of Rustaceans Anonymous is it?
 Astrobytes: "My name is Ferris and I'm a Rustacean"

 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nice idea darkhorse
 struct: Anyone knows if there is a database for breakthrough games?
 Marchete: asking for a friend?
 Astrobytes: No idea struct
 struct: I wanted to check popular openings
 struct: asking for me, I want to know if the opening my bot does is even played
 struct: or is trash 
 Marchete: yes to both
 Astrobytes: :P
 Marchete: search "breakthrough" in google :rofl:
 Marchete: you'll find exactly what you need
 derjack: try littlegolem
 Marchete: yes, littlegolem indeed it's usually a good source for that
 Marchete: if not maybe you can parse the replays
 derjack: you can parse that <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://littlegolem.net/servlet/sgf/2229093/game2229093.txt">https://littlegolem.net/servlet/sgf/2229093/game2229093.txt</a>

 darkhorse64: Apart from one paper on BT strategy that describes very tersely two openings, I have found nothing
 derjack: or you could just play rebless vs rebless in ide and observe the opening
 MSmits: did this plenty of times before when counterbooking. So... how does re curse beat re curse? 
 MSmits: help the meta mcts along a bit
 MSmits: go explore that branch, re curse says its good
 derjack: rebless and meta mcts? he would never say such a thing
 MSmits: his bot does :P
 MSmits: when bots play perfectly deterministically you can just pit them against eachother and copy their moves
 derjack: ah
 MSmits: it's lame, but works
 MSmits: trying template meta programming
 MSmits: I'm having trouble getting a specialized template with  1 param fixed and the other variable
 MSmits: was going to do a template loop 
 MSmits: which works if the loop variable is the only templated var
 MSmits: but if you have another you runinto problems apparently
 MSmits: I'm trying to do this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1f2a03c5-8e75-4bf6-924c-dafe4d56e460">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1f2a03c5-8e75-4bf6-924c-dafe4d56e460</a>
 MSmits: but get error of "illegal use of explicit template arguments"
 MSmits: trying to follow this: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Partial_template_specialization#/">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Partial_template_specialization#/</a>
 MSmits: probably I am asking a question not many can answer :p
 dbdr: not many can even ask it&#160;;)
 MSmits: hehe i guess so
 reCurse: You can't partially specialize a function
 MSmits: oh so only classes then
 MSmits: thanks reCurse, then i can stop wasting my time trying&#160;:)
 MSmits: I was using it to try and get a template loop going
 Astrobytes: Did you scroll down to caveats on that page?
 MSmits: apparently not&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: thanks for your reading skills Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I was a bit late, was afk&#160;:/
 MSmits: ah well
 Illedan: darkhorse64 starvation? :thinking: Like losing 1 every N round? I don't think it adds any value? Expect make it more complex
 derjack: it would make more sense with infinite frames
 derjack: but with limited moves you die anyway
 Illedan: ^
 Counterbalance: MSmits: here's a way to fake it:
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4a5e255b-eb26-4c76-a052-516216c6be87">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4a5e255b-eb26-4c76-a052-516216c6be87</a>
 MSmits: wow 
 MSmits: thanks will try
 MSmits: such obscure tricks
 MSmits: Counterbalance is there any performance hit to this? do you create some kind of struct?  
 Counterbalance: it shouldn't impact performance, and yes you create a  zero sized struct using that method..
 MSmits: funny
 ThereIsFunInFuneral--Jewelery: there is a way to split and map in ruby at the same time&#160;?
 Counterbalance: it's more or less the same as this:
 MSmits: oh you call it as a method of the struct?
 Counterbalance: that's the idea.. and when you make it static, it's not even a method anymore (disregards any this pointer in the method call if the compiler didn't optimize that away, which I doubt)
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: how do you pass parameters into the function?
 MSmits: in your example the struct has no params
 MSmits: i mean normal params, not template params
 Counterbalance: just declare them as params of the method
 MSmits: I guess i dont understand this part:
 MSmits: void operator()() {}
 MSmits: it has double parentheses
 Counterbalance: yes, the first is the operator, the second is for the args..operator()  (int a, float b) {...}
 MSmits: ahh great thanks
 darkhorse64: I have not played snake a lot but I remember you have to eat pellets regularly not to die from starvation: so you have several strats: eat more pellets or  deprive your opponent (while trying not to die yourself). When selecting a pellet to target, you have also to take into account the next one. That makes the game less Tron like
 darkhorse64: Clobber has passed the 100 players mark. I really did not expected it. It's really an abstract and difficult game with a noob hostile bot
 Astrobytes: Impressive!
 reCurse: You just described uttt
 darkhorse64: My bot is even more brute force than the UTTT one
 darkhorse64: However, there exist heuristics for Clobber. It's just that I cannot understand the papers
 MSmits: they're painfully hard to understand
 darkhorse64: chock full of strange and poorly explained symbols
 AllYourTrees: what papers?
 darkhorse64: lmgtfy&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: :scream:

 Benedikt.Huber: Hello everyone!
 darkhorse64: If you read it, you see that the author had trouble to beat a vanilla MCTS because CGT took too much time. It's a mission for MSmits to optimize it by 1 million factor
 MSmits: yes, it is, but 1 mission at a time :P
 MSmits: I did see that. So much good math wasted without much improvement
 dbdr: it's miklla #1 too. so same mission&#160;;)
 MSmits: he wrote that mcts solver helped most
 MSmits: same opponent, different mission, clobber is a different game really. It's jus also math and also uses nim, but clobber has different complications
 darkhorse64: I can confirm
 darkhorse64: on the slver
 darkhorse64: *solver*
 MSmits: yeah, it makes sense really
 MSmits: nim games require an exact solution
 MSmits: you can't "fuzzy" your way to a good score
 MSmits: might be less so in clobber as there are some eval opportunities
 MSmits: but in D&amp;B this is 100% the case
 darkhorse64: in the top 10, anyone can win anyone, it's just depend how you can randomly play the first turns
 AllYourTrees: hmm what do they mean for the selection part of solver? "in the selection phase a proven loss node is never considered, but in thesimulation phase it is considered."
 MSmits: are you saying the top are only ahead because of pruning and math in the solving process darkhorse64?
 AllYourTrees: what is a simulation phase?
 MSmits: simulation is random rollout
 MSmits: you want it to be fast
 MSmits: if you do mathematical pruning you lose a lot of sims
 AllYourTrees: wouldn't a node that is already in the tree not be encountered in a rollout? :thinking:
 MSmits: rollout is a poorly defined term
 MSmits: some people mean the whole tree traversal
 MSmits: others just mean the random rollout
 MSmits: (simulation)
 AllYourTrees: ah so are they say, when you traverse down the MCTS tree using UCT, they do consider proven loss nodeS?
 MSmits: they do it in expansion
 MSmits: and by extension, during selection
 MSmits: because selection uses expanded nodes
 darkhorse64: MSmits: dunno, they seem to come out of the opening in a better shape
 MSmits: but what happens in the random rollout is not stored
 struct: on c4 pruning helps a lot, but rollouts get more expensive
 struct: But become a lot more accurate
 MSmits: darkhorse64 could be some simple mathematical pruning in the random rollout, that could work a bit in the opening even
 struct: on Breakthrough I also did smart rollouts
 struct: on clobber is pure random mcts
 MSmits: also darkhorse64 i was referring to the paper. In the paper it didnt work for them when they used the math in the simulation, but it did work during expansion
 MSmits: simulation was too costly
 MSmits: (this was the part I could understand)
 MSmits: it's very possible our top players in clobber managed to speed it up enough for the sim
 darkhorse64: Yes heuristics may help for sim. For BT, i use EPT but my heuristic is not strong enough

 MSmits: it never ages well to include the word "new" in your paper title
 darkhorse64: :older_man:
 jacek: who cares about math in clobber. just throw NN at it and call it a day
 MSmits: until someone uses a NN + math and beats your NN 
 MSmits: I believe you should always use the NN for things you can't answer with 100% certainty using domain knowledge
 MSmits: you would not replace the xor operator with the xor NN example
 jacek: watch me
 MSmits: :grin:
 RoboStac: do you not do anything special to make the nn work jacek?
 darkhorse64: also try to solve at move 30
 RoboStac: mine refuses to learn it at the moment
 jacek: nothing special
 jacek: stil one-hots and very little because of size limit&#160;:(
 RoboStac: hmm, wonder if I've got something else wrong then
 Totomns: Do you know if it is possible to unroll and inline a const array of function  pointers in C? Or do i have to use constexpr and cpp?
 Totomns: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/z/GceYoojMT">https://godbolt.org/z/GceYoojMT</a>
 Totomns: function dilatation_F does not inline functions inside the loop
 reCurse: C is very limited with those kinds of optimizations, I think you're at a deadend unless you start using macros
 reCurse: Or ask yourself why you code in C
 Totomns: mainly out of habit
 Totomns: thanks
 jacek: bad habit eh
 Totomns: the MCU i'm working on do not have cpp compilers 
 Totomns: yeah...
 Totomns: so when i write cpp, i mostly write C Style, really bad habit.
 Totomns: Zero cost abstraction seems more approachable in c++ than in c
 reCurse: Very true
 reCurse: You usually have to do it yourself in C with codegen like macros or something more evolved
 jacek: k
 KiwiTae: Totomns time to join the cpp squad
 Totomns: \o KiwiTae
 MSmits: the MCU does not have cpp compilers? Then what language does Tony Stark code in?
 TobiasA: python
 TobiasA: and GBASIC
 MSmits: ahh makes sense
 MSmits: btw I am enjoying this template stuff a lot
 MSmits: it's really compressing my source code
 MSmits: for example I had 5 different while loops for different movetypes and now it's just 5 lines of calls to a single function that changes a bit depending on movetype (template var)
 jacek: template stuff?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: is it faster
 MSmits: it makes no difference, the compiler creates different functions for each template version
 MSmits: but it makes the code readable and smaller
 jacek: codegolfing eh
 MSmits: except it becomes more readable, not less :P
 TobiasA: template for what?
 MSmits: I loop over 5 different movetypes in D&amp;B for example
 MSmits: the loop is almost the same for each
 MSmits: with 1 line difference
 MSmits: perfect for templating

 reCurse: Wow ok, TIL
 reCurse: lc0 didn't seem to think it was great
 sprkrd: here's a game where h4 is played: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://kenilworthchessclub.org/games/java/2007/caro-adv-h4.htm">http://kenilworthchessclub.org/games/java/2007/caro-adv-h4.htm</a>
 reCurse: Then again it seems any slight mistake is considered a blunder
 reCurse: The caveman approach uh
 reCurse: At least I know which age my learning is at
 sprkrd: i don't know if "caveman approach" is just a funny name or it's indicative of the level of the move  :joy:
 jacek: are  you still training chess or chess960?
 reCurse: Chess
 sprkrd: I guess it doesn't as impressive as "the dragon variation"
 reCurse: It's easier to see if it's converging by looking at the openings
 reCurse: I think anyway
 reCurse: That it fumbles in the endgame is less concerning to me
 jacek: ive never hooked up on chess, i dont know whats going on
 reCurse: I'm not pretending I'm great at it but there's a lot of blunders I can spot instantly
 jacek: endgames requires precision in which nn are mostly crap
 reCurse: Which is a nice change compared to typical CG games
 reCurse: Not convinced about that statement
 jacek: maybe d&amp;b talking spoiled me
 reCurse: Openings are almost looking like legit chess now actually
 jacek: and yet your bashing opening books
 reCurse:&#160;??
 reCurse: How is that even related
 jacek: nevermind ~
 jacek: you raed when msmits counter booked in othello
 reCurse: I still fail to see any connection with what I just said
 jacek: you do RL now in chess?
 MSmits: counterbooking is different from just learning common/effective openings
 MSmits: especially when done by selfplay
 MSmits: it's pretty cool that your bot finds those openings reCurse. Early game play seems hardest to learn as it's furthest from the reward
 jacek: its cool to see my bot rediscovers usual opening in bt
 jacek: it prefers the one from the other
 MSmits: is it your usual opening or the opening that comes from professional play/scientific papers
 jacek: it is discovered by bot by itself
 MSmits: i mean, does it match
 MSmits: the "meta"
 MSmits: like chess openings
 jacek: at least using more time in littlegolem
 MSmits: how do you make it run on littlegolem?
 jacek: parsing html
 MSmits: who are its opponents? Other bots or players?
 jacek: littlegolem are played mostly players
 MSmits: do they know it's a bot?
 jacek: i named it derjack_bot duh
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: dont they have any problems with this?
 jacek: even the guys from papers used littlegolem as benchmark
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: i wasnt banned yet
 MSmits: well on some sites they dont like it
 MSmits: it's cool if they allow it
 sprkrd: I'm gonna say they would had a problem with it if they knew :joy:
 reCurse: Actually I think early game is easiest to learn in chess because it's based on positional themes that are important for most of the game
 sprkrd: would have*
 MSmits: reCurse yeah i guess it depends on the game a lot. in oware and uttt the best opening is also very quickly found
 martinpapa69: also the more early in the game you are the lesser the variance is
 MSmits: i guess the state is more heavily visited/searched
 jacek: oh? in one paper for go the bot found good endgames and middlegames first, then later the openings
 reCurse: I know nothing about go
 MSmits: so yeah, dependent on the game then
 jacek: given how computers are better at go than humans, it should be called 'went'
 sprkrd: god
 Wontonimo: The game of go involves placing stones on a board but in the right place so that you win.
 MSmits: jacek, what about "gone"
 jacek: nyoro~n
 MSmits: is that the fire in water thing?
 jacek: quite obscure old meme
 reCurse: Wasn't even funny when it was out either

 dbdr: yeah, the NN/nonNN border looks pretty sharp now
 dbdr: in oware
 jacek: i use nn in clobber
 dbdr: 5 points
 AllYourTrees: oooh nice j
 Astrobytes: Other than Smits the divide was pretty much the same before, just more of the bloody things now D:

 Illedan: Astrobytes, do you think I need to animate the snake when there is multiple moves a step? :thinking:
 Illedan: I feel like just teleporting the snake if there is a lot of movement
 Astrobytes: teleporting is probably more efficient
 Illedan: Done deal

 jacek: im gonna delete account
 jacek: leave no trace of failure
 sprkrd: the number you output alongside your action is the number of rollouts you do?
 sprkrd: or simulations or whatever you want to call it
 jacek: its the eval
 jacek: im using minimax here
 sprkrd: ah, I see
 sprkrd: which depth can you achieve? I assume not much at the beginning, right? Like 2 at most?
 Astrobytes: You can prune
 struct: I dont know that word
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: You can delete
 Astrobytes: hehe
 jacek: 2 even 1 at beginning
 jacek: but 4-5 ni late middlegame
 jacek: its all about the eval
 sprkrd: yeah, i think I have a fine eval function too, but I don't use minimax
 sprkrd: I wanted to start easy first and build up the complexity incrementally
 jacek: :scream:
 struct: teach me
 Astrobytes: Time to push the NN jacek
 struct: will the NN get 100%?
 sprkrd: can you hold off the fancy stuff until I get a screenshot at #1, pretty please? :joy:
 sprkrd: or is this war? :rage:
 jacek: i will wait
 jacek: until amazons will be potw
 Astrobytes: It's always war in community multis :D
 sprkrd: but being friendly and asking things nicely is just another war tactic
 sprkrd: then I bite the jugular off
 Astrobytes: Well, you have to help each other to have better competition
 sprkrd: of course, exchange of prisoners

 jacek: Oo
 Counterbalance: TerryDenn the most common cause is that you print more than 1 command per turn. And the only way to see the input passed to your bot is to print it yourself.
 Astrobytes: And check you didn't delete any important default code. Also, if you use python,  set flush=True
 MSmits: always flush, helps with the smell
 Astrobytes: Enough with yer jobby talk laddie :D

 TerryDenn: I have create a file locally and have executed my script - locally everything is find. the last turn it produces the correct command
 TerryDenn: so if the script doesn't read something it's not logging it and I can't reproduce it locally&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Are you timing out?
 TerryDenn: no

 Astrobytes: Gotta be done sometimes, make the most of it
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: finally done refactoring my bot. Down to 2.6k, not that much smaller, but way more readable
 MSmits: I'm working on that improvement now
 MSmits: will be a while
 MSmits: templates are so nice
 Astrobytes: Good job man. Yeah? I thought it would be (relatively) straightforward to implement?
 MSmits: it is straightforward as in, i know what to do, still a lot of code and probably some debugging
 Astrobytes: And yep, templates are a pain sometimes but very handy!
 MSmits: this really was missing from my bots. I always have so much duplicate code i cant get rid off
 Astrobytes: test as you go
 Astrobytes: lol, refactor ALL your CG bots after Clobber
 MSmits: nooo, I'll refactor them when i revisit them :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 TerryDenn: @Counterbalance you were right. I have found the place that sends 2 commands instead of 1

 SeizedSilver: ok who has done The Urinal Problem?  I'm passing all of the test cases, but when I submit, I'm failing the last validator. It's driving me nuts I can't think of any edge cases where it wouldn't work&#160;:(

 SeizedSilver: thats my code for it
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: SeizedSilver probably shouldn't paste code in a public chat, it gives people the opportunity to copy it, instead of figuring it out themselves
 SeizedSilver: good point. my bad. but It doesn't work anyway lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: xD
 Wontonimo: i don't know about malicious, perhaps playfullyRandomUsername
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: :eyes:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wontonimo scarfield suggested this one, and ive kept it for a looooong timeToo lazy to change :P
 Wontonimo: :relieved:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: :taco: Here is taco for you btw
 Wontonimo: oh, thankyou
 struct: saw my bot having 70% won locally
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: :o
 struct: ran more battles it went down to 50&#160;:'(
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: D:
 AllYourTrees: rip
 Wontonimo: are you working on any multis MaliciouslyCrypticUsername&#160;?
 Wontonimo: but, isn't it supposed to get to 50 when it levels off anyway?
 BobLob: I think I see a problem, SeizedSilver
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wontonimo yes, i have bots for a dozen different ones, but im focusing on csb rn. I cant get past rank 400 gold&#160;:(I wrote this code a couple years ago and I dont remember what all the variables areNames are all "oa" and "e" and stuff
 struct: Not if the version should be better :D
 SeizedSilver: boblob oooo what do you see?
 Wontonimo: has anyone introduce you to the -3v algo for CSB?
 BobLob: @SeizedSilver I chnged the B string to see if it was reporting the correct position.  Try this string:  !UUUUUUUUUU!
 struct: maybe -3 x popcount(pieces)
 BobLob: I changed, even, and that's 10 U's between the two&#160;!'s
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: yes xDMadKnight did for me WontonimoI used it to get past silver, but i still cant get past gold
 Wontonimo: did he tell you about the slide to next checkpoint algo?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: That's what I'm doing :eyes:I turn right before checkpoint, and I have a few more lines that determine the direction of the checkpoint after and turn in that directionI also have my blocker to slow down my opponent
 BobLob: SeizedSilver It gives a result or 5, while 6 is an equally valid result.  Maybe try reporting the last index found instead of the first?
 Wontonimo: how do you determine if it is the right time to turn and what to turn to?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I do it based on velocityAnd as for the direction, I have a list of checkpoints, in order of numberI just go the next index over and check the position in relation to the pod
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Or if it's the last checkpoint i just go to index #0
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: oops
 BobLob: Failing that, it's easy to generate strings and run them through your program.  You can automate the checks as well
 SeizedSilver: aah but it says to use the leftmost if there is more than one
 BobLob: SeizedSilver I can't read obviously.  It says to report the left most index in case of  tie, but you can still generate your own known patterns and test tem.
 BobLob: them, even
 Wontonimo: i'm looking at this playback <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/564821620">https://www.codingame.com/replay/564821620</a> and it doesn't look like your bot is checking if it is good to slide.  Gotta look at least 5 moves ahead
 Wontonimo: maybe it is looking 1 move ahead.  Just put that in a loop 5 times maybe
 SeizedSilver: this may be a dumb question but how do i automate checks and test the patterns? boblob
 SeizedSilver: like in my own IDE?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wontonimo yea it's only looking 1 move ahead, for the reason that I can't predict opponent's moves, and that may affect me, especially if they're closeI could just predict, and assume they won't affect me, but that's not going to work in the long run
 Wontonimo: oh yes it will
 Wontonimo: well, not long long run, but it will work amazingly
 Wontonimo: for now
 Wontonimo: if you get ahead, doesn't really matter if you don't predict collision
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: mmmWell my bot doesn't turn anyway if there're two checkpoints in a row, I thinkLet me check
 Wontonimo: (for now.  high legend is different)
 BobLob: SeizedSilver nah, you can do it in your code.  You can make a counter that counts from say, 1 to 1000, in binary, and use that binary number to create a sting ( 1 is a&#160;! and is a U ).  Send that string through your algorithm, and see what result you get out the other side.
 SeizedSilver: BobLob idk how to do that:sweat_smile:
 BobLob: SeizedSilver oh, well, you can manually do it instead to test edge cases.  Where the string " String B = in.nextLine();" is, just replace that with String B="whatever here"';
 BobLob: Then you can make your own bathrooms like String B="UUU!UUU!";
 SeizedSilver: aaah BobLob thank you, I understand now
 BobLob: Have a function put a * or some other unique character where you should stand in the B string, then print it out again.  You can visually check it to see if it looks right.
 SeizedSilver: that's a great idea.  thanks for the help. im going to start testing this thing...its driving me crazy lol
 struct: 65% in a few more battles, I guess ill try it the arena
 AllYourTrees: if im getting 12 mill nodes first turn its probably a bug right? &gt;&lt;
 struct: my other version can just be bad vs this bot
 struct: Which game?
 AllYourTrees: clobber
 struct: Do you rollout each node?
 AllYourTrees: wait are there games where you can get 12 mill nodes?
 struct: Dont think so
 AllYourTrees: hmm where have i gone wrong...
 struct: Maybe if I expand and only rollout once and have EPT
 struct: on cobbler I get like 1.7M nodes in first turn
 struct: but I rollout for all nodes created
 AllYourTrees: cobbler!!! lol
 AllYourTrees: hmm okay
 struct: also depends on cpu
 struct: The range is between 1.5-1.8M
 struct: These god damn NNs

 AllYourTrees: dang impressive
 AllYourTrees: im still at 600-700k first turn
 AllYourTrees: i don't think ive done mcts solver completely correctly
 AllYourTrees: still kinda confused about selection strategy when a child is solved
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c778882-b8fd-43b3-801c-d98d255101db">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c778882-b8fd-43b3-801c-d98d255101db</a>
 AllYourTrees: you just skip all together?
 AllYourTrees: do you add that 1/sqrt(n) when selecting best move?
 struct: yes
 struct: skip?
 struct: I skip if the child is solved
 AllYourTrees: err yeah
 struct: if the parent was solved I would never have selected it
 AllYourTrees: in the paper they talk about over/underestimation if you don't select proven losses
 struct: why would I select a proven loss?
 AllYourTrees: But when one or more childrenare proven to be a loss, it is tempting to discard them in the selection phase.However, this can lead to overestimating the value of a node, especially whenmoves are pseudo-randomly selected by the simulation strategy
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a> is the one im looking at
 AllYourTrees: :shrug:
 struct: makes sense if the lose was hard to find I guess
 struct: i dont have a lot of knowledge about  this though
 struct: I havent read the papers
 AllYourTrees: it probably doesn't make that much of a difference lol
 AllYourTrees: or rather, maybe there are efficiency gains that outweight the potential over/understimations?
 struct: it will allow you to search other nodes

 Ayza: I see
 struct: Ayza the game is pretty much based on performance
 Ayza: speed
 struct: unless you use a NN
 struct: but its not the only thing that matters
 Ayza: algorithm
 struct: Most of the players use mcts there
 struct: you can get less performance if you use an heavier rollout
 struct: and the bot will be better
 Uljahn: i guess it's relatively easy to get legend with vanilla MCTS and C++, while almost impossible with python
 struct: all you need is bitboards and vanilla mcts
 struct: Maybe bitboards are not even needed
 jacek: or chocolate mcts
 Murat_Eroglu: lol
 Magus: by experience, a vanilla MCTS is quickly crushed by a "not so vanilla" MCTS with the same performances.
 Magus: A simple tweak in the rollout can skyrocket a vanilla MCTS
 jacek: depends on definition of "vanilla". for me, mcts solver is vanilla
 Magus: vanilla = a MCTS with random everywhere.
 Magus: But you can tweak the rollout, you can tweak the move selection, you can tweak the board eval (and not just assigning +1 or -1).
 struct: vanilla = random and only check win when game actually ends
 struct: Checking early wins is a big improvement
 Uljahn: is it some sort of EPT?
 struct: well I would say so but you dont have a fixed depth
 struct: You just check if a game was won before it reached the last move
 struct: This is possible in multiple games
 struct: connect 4, uttt, onitama, bt
 struct: I used on all of them
 jacek: decisive and antidecisive moves eh
 RandomSteve: why do some puzzles save progress but others don't?
 struct: you need to press play my code before closing the ide
 RandomSteve: ohhhhh

 Ghap: Hey guys
 Fallheur: hellohello
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Is someone familiar with some approximation algorithms for the Travelling Salesman Problem?
 5DN1L: you can google
 5DN1L: there are lots of online resources
 Manchi_o6o7: I've tried to, but I am looking for something which should work with directed graphs
 Manchi_o6o7: The minimum spanning tree approach works for undirected graphs, as far as I could notice
 abt8601: I know GA can solve it, but I'm not sure whether or not it's what you're looking for.
 jacek: yeah try some meta heuristics like GA, SA etc
 jacek: or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/travelling-salesman/discuss">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/travelling-salesman/discuss</a>
 MSmits: if you mean GA can get a solution to the TSP, then yeah, but so can a simple random order. A solution just means you visited all the nodes one time.
 MSmits: if you mean GA can find the exact solution, then no it can't. It can just find a good one
 MSmits: unless you are lucky, but then you don't know it is exactly optimal
 jacek: even amoebas can do traveling salesman, why cant you
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: I think 2 more days before my 38 seed DB finishes. Hope it's error-free
 MSmits: then I'll try to make a good meta mcts DB for a rematch vs professor X&#160;:)
 Fallheur: hello again
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: hi
 Fallheur: i am trying to finish Astroid Puzzle and I can't find a way to pass test 7
 Fallheur: sorry forget what i said... 
 Fallheur: I just found the information i was missing
 jacek: :duck:
 DomiKo: MSmits 38 sounds really crazy
 jacek: and he still cant beat us
 DomiKo: :joy:
 MSmits: If I use the full information from it and counterbook you guys, I'm pretty sure I can. I might give it a whirl&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: wew
 MSmits: but yea 38 is crazy. The last iteration (states with exactly 38 seeds) is 25 GB. Total database is around 100 GB
 jacek: 38 is the max you can establish your db collapses
 MSmits: 38 is the max i can reach with my current method, unless i buy more RAM
 MSmits: I have 32 GB currently
 MSmits: I could probably get 40 seeds if I doubled this, but then I'd need 2 months of runtime and use up another 80 GB storage
 MSmits: different methods exist, but I don't think I'll go there. No matter what method i use, it's an insane amount of cpu time
 MSmits: and storage space
 jacek: how much ram your gpu has
 MSmits: not that much
 jacek: can you use gpu ram as swap? :thinking:
 MSmits: no idea, but I think the delay from the communication between them will slow it too much
 MSmits: the memory is really used randomly
 MSmits: i cant just cordon off a piece that mostly does not talk with another piece
 jacek: youre not talking about you and your wife right?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: we talk :P
 MSmits: for example, the other day she told me i should turn my computer off at night because the humming drives her nuts
 jacek: she cant appreciate science
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: btw, I looked at othello
 MSmits: that guy at nr 1 really did a serious counterbooking
 MSmits: i think it's silly he wrote such a good bot and then proceded to make an enormous counterbook. He booked like 30 plies deep
 MSmits: just win without the trick if you can.
 jacek: :unamused:
 jacek: he tweets only about othello and rubik cube
 MSmits: I mean i know i cant win without it, unless I do a NN also, so I dont mind using my tricks, but he doesnt need to
 MSmits: yeah i saw that
 MSmits: he basically threw his bot on github also
 MSmits: though it's not his CG version afaik
 MSmits: he did that probcut thing dbdr did
 MSmits: dbdr's bot is one of the best, recurse had problems beating it with his nn
 jacek: so do i. he got beaten by others so hes low
 MSmits: yeah, he's extremely easy to book against
 MSmits: when i tried, it only took me like half an hour or so
 MSmits: but that's exploiting the 1 mistake he makes in the entire game. Almost perfect play
 MSmits: pretty sure nyan yan does that also
 jacek: time to counterbook the booker
 MSmits: yeah i was really tempted to, but I need more computers. 
 MSmits: also, he might be unbeatable, with only a draw as an ideal result
 MSmits: perhaps i can find a really unlikely line of perfect play most bots dont find and then work from there
 jacek: well you managed recurce to rage quit
 MSmits: yeah but he didnt play perfectly either, just almost, like dbdr
 jacek: i dont play perfectly either, i just use more random
 MSmits: I think their bots make on average 1 mistake per game. Yours 2, unless you improved it. The random makes it super hard to counter
 MSmits: takes days to find all the possible lines of play
 MSmits: allright, going to watch the boys season 3, ttyl&#160;:)
 jacek: oh, theres new orville
 AustinB77: Please remove shortest code mode from COC :pray:
 ethaneCH3CH3: why? it is fun
 jacek: oO
 aaravm4: ocaml moment
 Scarfield: the boys season 3 :O
 Westicles: Yes, keep watching American TV
 aaravm4: stranger things
 aaravm4: is good tho
 thethiny: I agree with Austin
 thethiny: it adds no value 
 thethiny: only teaches people to write bad code
 thethiny: illegible code
 thethiny: and write fast without assurance of quality
 thethiny: or learning anything
 Ayza: but I guess it's just a challenge, no one would try to do it in real world problems
 drnobody: I respectfully disagree. I've learned a lot about the various ways to do things. I don't love it and I lose a lot, but I've learned a ton.
 Ayza: personally I learned a lot of language tricks from other people's code
 drnobody: ditto
 Ayza: + these tricks won't affect my code performance, just saves me time
 mogzhey: the shortest code mode is the most fun one
 mogzhey: doesn't matter if you don't learn anything, it's a game
 jacek: and your colleagues will love you for writing incomprehensible code without comments
 thethiny: &gt;personally I learned a lot of language tricks from other people's code
 5DN1L: don't focus on the variable names
 5DN1L: there are other language tricks
 5DN1L: that can be used in legible code
 thethiny: that's why I'm saying
 thethiny: this game mode produces illegible code
 5DN1L: it's just a way to learn things
 5DN1L: if you don't like it, fine
 Ayza: my point is there are functions or operators that I never knew before
 Ayza: as 5D1NL said
 5DN1L: others can learn from it, it's also fine
 thethiny: I don't like it but it's part of the clash and I have to play it
 thethiny: &gt;Ayza 10:55ᴾᴹmy point is there are functions or operators that I never knew before
 5DN1L: nobody forces you to play it
 thethiny: cool story
 mogzhey: the game mode is also fun
 mogzhey: at the end of the day, it's a game
 mogzhey: I'm a slow typer so I don't like fastest mode but you don't see me asking people to remove it lmao
 thethiny: as long as you like it
 thethiny: you do you

 thethiny: the one about linear Gamma Correction
 struct: is it a clash?
 thethiny: yes the clash
 thethiny: sorry I forgot to say
 struct: Well I can share the link that has the solution if you want
 thethiny: I did see the solution to be able to understand the problem, but without the solution I'd never have understood the requirements
 struct: ah yeah
 thethiny: and the chat agreed with me on that one, so I think more explanation needed for that clash
 struct: The statement was not clear to me too
 thethiny: I submitted the feedback anyhow so we'll see if they adjust it for the future
 struct: :thumbsup:
 waterproofsodium: i recently downvoted a very mean clash puzzle that made me score place 8 because not reading :smirk:

 thethiny: Thank you :D
 Wontonimo: Hope someone mentioned that there is more than clash of code here.  Lots of us really like the multi bot battles
 thethiny: yeah don't worry about it
 Wontonimo: oh, thank goodness.  cuz i was so worried that I burnt through all my medication

 thethiny: will give it a try

 Westicles: 'Temperatures' is a trademark of the Exergen temporal scanning thermometer.  Let's change it to 'Measurable Weather Units'
 Anthony.Perry: I'm confused. I'm beating the boss in the arena, but whenever I exit the window that has the video playing in it, I don't rank up
 jacek: did you submit to arena, and not only play in ide?
 Anthony.Perry: OK i advanced now. it just took a very long time
 jacek: it needs to finish all the games (about 90) to calcuate the rank and advance if possible
 5DN1L: 90 or some other number, depending on which game it is
 Miki09: I'm getting this error in my contribution. Can someone pls help?
 Miki09: Mismatch with the stub generator input: Invalid value. Expected: 'A non-empty string with no spaces'. Received: ' ######'
 5DN1L: Maybe your solution code expects to read something different from what the stub generator tries to output?
 bearnilugeo: your input has space&#160;?
 Miki09: Yeah :D I'm dumb lol
 skyline69: sup

 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 jacek: another day another struggle to find the right inputs <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/qccw8e">https://streamable.com/qccw8e</a>
 Wontonimo: i'm assuming those  lines are the NN's vision lines
 Wontonimo: perhaps 360 instead of 10&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 Wontonimo: or and  the 360 can be done "quickly" by using a zbuffer  and painting each object onto the 360
 jacek: each line encodes collision. then theres one hot for type of collision, then target's vx and vy
 jacek: thats 7 inputs per line
 jacek: oh and distance to target
 jacek: with my other inputs, i have already 81 inputs to net
 jacek: zbuffer?
 jacek: im more concerned or not exploding inputs number
 jacek: 360 rays :v <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/K9JupQX.png">https://i.imgur.com/K9JupQX.png</a>
 Wontonimo: okay, maybe 360 is too many
 Wontonimo: you could do a max_pool / min_pool over the 360 and reduce it to something smaller like 18 by pooling every 20 inputs
 Wontonimo: then 18 inputs to into your NN
 Wontonimo: but 360 seems at bit much.  the pooling is still an idea though.  it will help not have so many blind spots
 Wontonimo: for zbuffering you would not cast  rays out from every direction.  instead...
 Wontonimo: you would iterate over objects and paint them onto the inputs, but only if their distance is less than what is already painted there
 Wontonimo: in the last picture you sent,  
 Wontonimo: with the observer being n2,
 Wontonimo: you would 'paint' n3 onto n2's view of field.  There is a left and right most line from n2 to n3
 Wontonimo: everything inbetween is n3
 Wontonimo: repeat for n4 and n5
 Wontonimo: since the n2's view has depth encoded, (aka zbuffer) then all the information about if n3, n4, or n5 obscure eachother is there
 Wontonimo: hey Louzy 
 jacek: mhm
 Wontonimo: just ideas, maybe your raycasting is more efficient
 jacek: then again, most time is taken in NN calculation than rays, i wouldnt worry about it now
 Wontonimo: what do you think about the  max/min pooling to reduce the number of inputs?
 Louzy: Im playing Coders Strike Back, and i am stuck in a level where it says the following&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/924505e6-8412-4840-bba7-94185e5a7521">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/924505e6-8412-4840-bba7-94185e5a7521</a>
 pb4: jacek, you're working on BR&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: you have NN for that?
 Wontonimo: hey Louzy, there is an error  in that line
 pb4: Current Gagat is a NN
 Wontonimo: cout &lt;&lt; next_checkpoint_x &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; next_checkpoint_y &lt;&lt; " 100" &lt;&lt; endl;
 pb4: but it's not good...
 pb4: not good enough*
 pb4: reCurse has a NN, I assume you know&#160;?
 Wontonimo: no way, reCurse uses NNs?
 jacek: :O
 Wontonimo: :P
 jacek: i never asked him. im curious what inputs does he have
 pb4: I'd love to know too :P
 pb4: He never said
 jacek: maybe he screenshots the game and use CNN ~
 Wontonimo: are your rays oriented from the POV  of the observer, such that a particular ray is always straight forward?
 pb4: How good is your NN currently, and how do you train it&#160;?
 jacek: those rays come from the car and yes they are oriented
 jacek: im 13th in wood4 so not that good
 pb4: Q-learning, policy learning, AZ, something else&#160;?
 pb4: One per pod, or one per team&#160;?
 jacek: im in the process of getting right inputs, the arena uses this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/ym3dcx">https://streamable.com/ym3dcx</a>
 pb4: Alphastar-style&#160;?
 Guynen: hi guys
 jacek: one per pod, 2 outputs - degrees and thrust. train by neuroevolution
 Wontonimo: humans don't have photo receptors evenly space in our eyes.  A lot in the center of view then fewer elsewhere.  More accuracy where it counts
 jacek: :thinking:
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/lrbcmc">https://streamable.com/lrbcmc</a>
 Wontonimo: neuroevolution is --s--l--o--w-- 
 pb4: What does neuroevolution mean&#160;?
 Wontonimo: to train
 pb4: Like, the NEAT algorithm&#160;?
 jacek: so smooth
 jacek: nah, fixed topology. random peturbation until you get it right
 jacek: in weights

 pb4: This one I had fun with
 pb4: 2 pods on the same team
 pb4: no opponent
 Louzy: @Wontonimo if i won against the boss why wont the game progress&#160;? and show me the next level&#160;?
 pb4: just try to score as fast as possible
 pb4: I like the sort of dance they found in the end&#160;:)
 jacek: this early version sees 1 ball only <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/2u1ont">https://streamable.com/2u1ont</a> when it misses ball it takes some rounds get it back
 jacek: Louzy submit it to arena and wait until it plays some games
 Louzy: its it supposed to reach 100%&#160;? jacek&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 Louzy: Alright thank you
 Wontonimo: hey Louzy, I'm looking at some replays of your current submit
 Louzy: Its at 34%
 Wontonimo: and I can see that your pod either needs to correct for understeering or slow down when it is off course
 Louzy: with the if statement&#160;?
 pb4: jacek mp
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: here is an example Louzy of just being way too fast when hitting ing the checkpoint <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/593468221">https://www.codingame.com/replay/593468221</a>
 Wontonimo: you could either slow down when approaching the checkpoint or
 Wontonimo: slow down when your angle to the next checkpoint is too high
 Wontonimo: btw, you can change who your opponent is in your local testing before you submit.  You can use that feature to go up against bots you had trouble with
 Guynen: :money_mouth:
 Wontonimo: hey Louzy, here is an example of where not slowing down or corrective steering is making the pod miss the checkpoint <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/593469362">https://www.codingame.com/replay/593469362</a>  look at frame 45 to to 60
 jacek: Wontonimo about your comment on neuroevolution being slow. so far this is only thing i know how to do it. once i figure out relevant inputs, architecture etc maybe ill try something more sophisticated
 jacek: also its more scalable to thousands of cpus, so if i get those, the neuroevolution will be faster :v
 UZUHAMA: This thing gives me a headache
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: fair point jacek 
 UZUHAMA: finally, i got in bronze league..
 UZUHAMA: and now I have no idea what to do
 jacek: get to the silver league

 Wontonimo: hey UZUHAMA, what multi are you working on?
 UZUHAMA: Um
 UZUHAMA: I just finished the first league in ultimate tic-tac-toe
 UZUHAMA: So I got into the bronze league and...
 UZUHAMA: It was way too complicated for me
 UZUHAMA: So I decided to try something else
 Mouad2: Hi guys
 UZUHAMA: And now I'm solving your Code Breaker Puzzle :D
 jacek: oh right, wood is normal tic tac toe
 UZUHAMA: And I think I made the wrong choice
 UZUHAMA: I don't get anything of it
 jacek: maybe ask the author :v
 UZUHAMA: lol
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: i made another puzzle called "Fax Machine" that is arguably easier
 Mouad2: I'm new using Codingame , and i'm invited to pass technical test in the plateform , does any has any ideas on how the usualy the test is&#160;? is it QCM or problem solving  
 UZUHAMA: Oh, I'm definitely trying that instead
 jacek: Quartz Crystal Microbalance?
 Wontonimo: i also have some 'tips and tricks' for simplifying ultimate tic tac toe so that the 9x9 board isn't so crazy

 Justin-Truong: hi guy
 Justin-Truong: how can i delete a spam message on discord
 Justin-Truong: a hacker spam a lot of message on my discord so my account have been banned every where
 TechWithTim.py: dont click any downloads or dodgy links. A lot of them are node.js scripts that obtain information of your account which makes it exposable for bots
 TechWithTim.py: Be more careful
 TechWithTim.py: And try to change your password
 Wontonimo: and delete  plugins
 C26_1: @all
 Wontonimo: @ doesn't do nothin
 C26_1: Is there a way to delete a comment using a cmd in Windows?
 TechWithTim.py: hey guys
 C26_1: I've seen a video from ThioJoe that deleting his spam comment using a program
 C26_1: Topic discussed: How to debug SQL query if they're so slow or wrong?
 Wontonimo: use "explain" in sql to review what the system is doing
 C26_1: O
 C26_1: Oh
 C26_1: I've never heard that command since I learn SQL
 Wontonimo: check indexes of tables
 Wontonimo: break sql into parts and test the   parts
 C26_1: SELECT *FROM StudentWHERE name LIKE '[aeoui]%[aeoui]'
 Justin-Truong: how to delete plugin
 Wontonimo: table scan (most likely), so that would be as slow as the number of entries in the table
 Justin-Truong: oh thánk
 Justin-Truong: thankss
 C26_1: -- Meaning: SELECT all rows in Student table where student's name has vowels both at the beginning and the end of their name
 Wontonimo: depends on the platform or program.  in chrome, just to to plugins.  in twitter, just go to plugins
 C26_1: @Wontonimo
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: Does all query in SQL has meaning?
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 C26_1: That means we can translate query into normal English sentence?
 Wontonimo: more like&#160;: a SQL can be translated into regular code
 Wontonimo: for example
 Wontonimo: SELECT *FROM StudentWHERE name LIKE '[aeoui]%[aeoui]'would roughly translate into
 Wontonimo: for student in Student
 Wontonimo: typos aside, that's pretty much what is happening
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: Thank you
 C26_1: I thought that a query will run from top to bottom like a normal code would
 Wontonimo: but if your WHERE clause used an index then it would make very different code that would leverage the index
 Wontonimo: let's say each student had a 'school' in plain text and it was indexed
 Wontonimo: SELECT * FROM Student WHERE name LIKE '[aeoui]%[aeoui]' AND school = 'North High'
 Wontonimo: may instead translate into
 Wontonimo: # Student_school is an associative array with index of school and a list of all students in that school
 Wontonimo: for student in Student_school['North High']:
 Wontonimo: if there are 100,000 students
 Wontonimo: then your query will have to scan all 100,000.
 Wontonimo: if there are only 200 students in North High, then my query only scans 200 records
 Wontonimo: using indexes properly greatly improves performance
 Westicles: oh brother.  another JCC potw
 TechWithTim.py: gl for the clash
 makerecho: meh, I tried dijkstra for the puzzle of the week, but apparently it is too slow XD guess it is time to sleep and then see if I can optimize it somehow XD
 Wontonimo: why not floodfill&#160;?
 makerecho: well, it is the same here as distance to next node is 1 ... but i time out on multi-path 1 and 2  still
 makerecho: I start at A coordinates, check all neighbors and update distance to each + add them to stack,  pop from stack to set new position and repeat 
 makerecho: pop(0) to take one with minimal distance that is
 Husoski: @makerecho something's wrong with your Dijkstra then.  I used a pretty plain BFS in Python and had no issues.
 makerecho: well, I pass all the rest OK, so either I do not flood in good direction or do not stop on time or something
 Codeab: hi guys
 Husoski: What language?
 Husoski: makerecho: A timout could mean that you're not properly marking entries as "already seen".  Might not kill a small test but can time out on large inputs.
 Husoski: (Full disclaimer: I've done that.  More than once.)
 Husoski: :upside_down:
 Husoski: s/disclaimer/disclosure/
 makerecho: that is very possible&#160;:)  or I am visiting something I do not need to visit at all
 Westicles: It is just sad to pick a 3D puzzle when a 5D is available
 makerecho: ha
 makerecho: pass&#160;:)
 makerecho: on my stack, I was not checking if the node is already in the list of nodes to visit, so I could add it multiple times
 ZXC01: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 ZXC01: so sad
 ZXC01: how long do i need to wait?
 Westicles: It depends on puzzle type and how many times you hit it.  Anywhere from about a minute to several hours
 ZXC01: hmm why does that happen?
 Westicles: all kinds of reasons.  for example for golf you can submit random answers hundreds of times or whatever
 ZXC01: oh
 ZXC01: but i cant improve my code then...
 Westicles: do it offline
 ZXC01: idk if it works...

 cazeoj: thrust = 100 * 2 is the best tip
 ZXC01: WHATTTTTTT
 Thorcode: that is for legend bro cazeoj
 Codyz: the angle is the best tip
 Thorcode: but when you reach gold -&gt; slap
 Thorcode: vector is best
 Thorcode: vector+drift
 e_fishel: do yall like js?
 e_fishel: js/ts
 Thorcode: no
 e_fishel: D:
 Thorcode: I like python
 e_fishel: what do  you like
 e_fishel: ooh
 e_fishel: fair enough
 e_fishel: i don't know python
 e_fishel: i intentionally didn't say yet
 e_fishel: js is so magical 
 Thorcode: really
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode, share the velocity correction tip

 Thorcode: oh
 ZXC01: bruh dont share the answer
 Thorcode: bc gold have vector for you already
 Thorcode: and  I copied wrong

 ZXC01: for silver
 ZXC01: caulate the speed vector

 Thorcode: hey
 ZXC01:&#160;?
 ZXC01:&#160;???
 Thorcode: why you print your code
 ZXC01: thats my code 10 days ago
 Thorcode: but that can get through sliver
 Thorcode: Wontonimo can you delete message on world?
 Wontonimo: nope, but i can kick people who keep doing it.  dont post full code on world
 ZXC01: ok
 ZXC01: sry
 Thorcode: yep
 ZXC01: accident
 Thorcode: you could just say add prev_x+=x and prev_y+=y
 ZXC01: ok
 Thorcode: I hope there will be more gold player in mad
 Wontonimo: so generally it goes like this:it's okay to mention what strategy or algorithm by name and talk about the challenges and advantages it has
 Wontonimo: it is also okay to post a small segment (not whole thing) of something you want help with or you are helping someone else
 Thorcode: In gold is there anything else without vector and drift?
 Wontonimo: it's velocity (not vector) and drift.  Those two should make your pod super fast
 Wontonimo: if you can upgrade your drift to take into account aiming at the next checkpoint instead of the current one
 Thorcode: oh slow down when get to a checkpoint is good also
 Wontonimo: maybe.  it is worth calculating if you can.  but just full speed should be good
 Wontonimo: i've heard that if you get that going really well and have both your pods doing that then you'll pass gold bot
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: you may have to make a good blocker.  A good blocker will camp on the checkpoint ahead of the leading enemy and wait just outside their checkpoint
 Wontonimo: and use shields to hold its place, always moving to be just barely touching the checkpoint but blocking the opponent
 Wontonimo: it's real annoying but it works

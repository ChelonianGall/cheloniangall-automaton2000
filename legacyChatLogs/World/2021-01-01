 Jay3401: Hello
 soutenu: hi!
 ChampionCoder: Happy new year, guys!
 rusty_developer: hi my friends
 rusty_developer: i am trying to learn a rust
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: good morning
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 jrke: happy new decade everyone
 eulerscheZahl: didn't the decade start last year?
 jrke: nope this year i think
 eulerscheZahl: mine goes from 2020 to 2029. like every good programmer I always start counting at 0
 pipebits: True
 VizGhar: Which decade this year belongs to: 302x? When new millenia started? 2001 or 2000?&#160;:)
 NguyenDinhDuong: 2000 :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: download is still working \o/<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</a>
 jrke: euler did you got you hacktoberfest t-shirt?
 eulerscheZahl: of course not. i don't participate in such events
 jacek: flash? what year is it? 2020?
 eulerscheZahl: i've downloaded the player and some old flash games just to be sure they are still working
 jacek: i think i got this 2048 learning working \o/
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 eulerscheZahl: what's the highest tile you can reach?
 jacek: dunno yet, right now im looking at total score
 jacek: but with bruteforce and snake i can get around 600k
 jacek: is there 131k there?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, but not reachable for all testcases
 jacek: so 18 states per tile&#160;:/
 saikoaizen: 77889977445555662233115547885544552266855
 saikoaizen: find the number that occurs odd number of times
 jacek: odd question
 saikoaizen: (*dumb question)
 saikoaizen: lmao, don't count. write a program
 eulerscheZahl: find the "number"do you mean digit? or any substring?
 Angecide: hi how does others output their text on their profile when watching replays?
 eulerscheZahl: while game?
 eulerscheZahl: usually: command message
 eulerscheZahl: just with a space between
 jacek: what game? some games dont support that
 Angecide: some have funny emojis depending on if they are winning or losing
 Angecide: I guess depending on what their mcts is evalutating
 jacek: UTTT?
 Angecide: ye
 Angecide: but i have seen this on other games as well
 eulerscheZahl: you can even see how they print it: just fight them in the IDE and you see their output
 jacek: you can print the emoji, its just unicode char
 Angecide: are they doing std::cerr?
 eulerscheZahl: stdouty x message
 eulerscheZahl: 7 3 i'm winning
 Angecide: ohhh
 eulerscheZahl: was about to say something like "reading is overrated" but the game doesn't even tell about that feature in the statement :D
 Angecide: oh yep, it's definitely working
 Angecide: ye, I searched everywhere 
 eulerscheZahl: at some point it's just experience as most games on CG work like that
 Angecide: I see
 jacek: see? nobody reads statements
 eulerscheZahl: it takes some time to write those&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: except for the CG sponsored game
 Illedan: Good morning. Happy new year&#160;:)
 [Tony-Stark]: happy new year
 MSmits: happy newyear
 jacek: newy ear?
 ZarthaxX: happy new year :D
 ChampionCoder: Happy new year, guys!
 MSmits: doubt many people gained a new ear, maybe some lost one last night though
 MSmits: we had a ban on fireworks this year because of covid, but not many people gave a :poop:
 MSmits: still seemed like a warzone
 MSmits: there were 30% less incidents this year. That's all the ban did. Emergency workers still had to sew on fingers and whatnot
 MSmits: one of the few things i hate about my country... fireworks
 MSmits:  /end rant
 tutubalin: fireworks spread viruses
 MSmits: doubt that, but they put more pressure on hospitals that are already at the breaking point
 MSmits: 1 million delayed surgeries and such
 MSmits: because people are idiots
 MSmits: not many people talk about that. It's fine and all to keep showing the deathcount of covid, but they dont talk much about people needing surgery and not being able to get it
 karliso: MSmits Do you have hangover?
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: no i don't drink karliso
 MSmits: happy newyear&#160;:)
 karliso: Thank you!&#160;:)
 ChampionCoder: Lol no crackers in my country
 ChampionCoder: Nobody burst them since Diwali
 eulerscheZahl: one of the few things i hate about my country... fireworks
 Astrobytes: +1 from me
 Astrobytes: and happy new year everyone
 zhoubou: Happy new year&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: always some who want to cause noise during the night. even during lockdown when you have to be at home at 9pm. but much more quiet than the years before
 eulerscheZahl: my cat loved it
 MSmits: my dog was a bit better this year also
 zhoubou: ^ Same
 zhoubou: He usually barks quite a lot. This time he didn't bark at all.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, at least our pets had a good time this year :D
 eulerscheZahl: also me working from home is great from her point of view
 Astrobytes: Indeed. I spend most days with one on my shoulder and one in my lap.
 jacek: 24/7 can opener
 eulerscheZahl: and living pillow
 Astrobytes: Yeah! In winter it's like having 2 live teddy bears. Vicious teddy bears.
 Astrobytes: Always wanting to sleep on or right next to you
 eulerscheZahl: or on my chair
 eulerscheZahl: so i sit on the trash can
 Astrobytes: Yes, when you want to sit on it. Hahaha
 Astrobytes: The sacrifices we make
 Kitkat260: gm
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3YT7ksgGJk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3YT7ksgGJk</a>
 TBali: HNY!So ,Astrobytes, you have 2 cats and only one of it is your profile pic? Doesn't that make the other one envy?
 TBali:&#160;:)
 sHlOk: Any hacker out here?
 Stilgart: ask AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the contest&#160;?
 TBali: Who asks? FBI?
 eulerscheZahl: no hackers. deleted one from the forum 1h ago
 Astrobytes: TBali: Yes, that's the case. For years I used the other cat as a profile pic, switched it around a while ago. Hopefully she doesn't mind too much&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: "how to hack latest game", links to a website for buying a dish washer
 sHlOk: I am an Ethical Hacker. So wanted to know if there are som here
 jacek: oO
 Stilgart: not sure if AutomatonNN is ethical
 eulerscheZahl: there's a guitar as well: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=23052489191875">https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=23052489191875</a>
 AutomatonNN: hey guys hey guys, could you be honest, and that makes sense to me in a linux and contests and the b
 Stilgart: and a cormen
 eulerscheZahl: and something with "alco" on the folder. studying for the barkeeper exam?
 TBali: and the CLRS book... how approriate profile pic&#160;:-)
 sHlOk: Any OSCP here?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it says "algorithms", a bit hard to read with that low resolution :D
 zhoubou: Lol
 Astrobytes: It seldom leaves my desk. Along with Stroustrup and a few others
 TBali: I  have the same edition. The leaf end reveals it
 TBali: Started to read it last March, still 140 pages to go...&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: It's not a quick read :D
 eulerscheZahl: and then you have to start again and see how much you've forgotton
 Astrobytes: I'm fairly certain I look something up in the introduction everytime I look up an algo lol
 TBali: Well for few 100 pages I was slow because I coded all pseudoalgorithms encountered. Then I gave that up, but was still slow following the proofs. 
 TBali: In the end I sometimes see myself just skim-reading the proof
 TBali: Would not be enough to pass an exam with A if I were on a CS class
 Astrobytes: Following the proof isn't 100% necessary if you just want to know about the algo, but it can be useful
 TBali: The important is not the proof but to understand how and why it works
 TBali: For that I found the Princeton video courses on Coursera exteremely good
 TBali: Less mathematically rigurous but still going deep
 TBali: Had to do the 10 assignments in Java made me learn it a bit more as well
 Astrobytes: I did a few courses irl some time ago, I admit I could probably do with a refresher
 TBali: Princeton topics highly overlapping with the CLRS book, of course
 eulerscheZahl: Java? now you are ready for the codingame SDK
 Astrobytes: some time ago: 2007
 Astrobytes: I also did a java course. Hated every minute of it.
 proogrmr: :no_mouth:
 TBali: SDK: LOL - I would need a great game idea first
 eulerscheZahl: surprise us&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: The exam involved handwriting a fair bit of Java. My hand was aching after.
 TBali: You can practice with cOc GOLF&#160;:-)
 struct: just port amazons
 TBali: Possibly the longest codes ever
 TBali: But maybe C# is even longer
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: are you telling that the SDK is in Java&#160;? :p
 TBali: Is it?
 Stilgart: wasn't it bad written C++&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: C# has more syntactic sugar to write short code than Java does
 eulerscheZahl: working on "Focus" yet struct?
 struct: no, im still doing stc
 Astrobytes: Amazons will be ready in 2022
 eulerscheZahl: when someone else, completely new to the CG community and not knowing about struct's plans, decides to just do it
 Astrobytes: :D
 TBali: Okay I admit being noob. What is Amazons?
 eulerscheZahl: board game
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/789/focus">https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/789/focus</a>i put this one up for discussion
 eulerscheZahl: you have towers of stones. and go as many fields as the tower is high. building new, higher towers in that process
 eulerscheZahl: first unable to move loses
 eulerscheZahl: if the tower exceeds a height of 5, stones from the bottom are removed.
 eulerscheZahl: moving player gets the stones back for later spawns
 eulerscheZahl: opponent tiles are out of game
 TBali: looks interesting.... and suitable for a multi
 eulerscheZahl: and 3D :P
 TBali: 1981 Spiel des Jahres Winner
 Astrobytes: Yes, that looks interesting
 Astrobytes: Have you played it?
 eulerscheZahl: no. but my dad has it in the basement
 Astrobytes: Well, you know what to do
 eulerscheZahl: a stream? :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Westicles: somebody do a Nuggets Numbers stream
 MSmits: wondev woman is also 3D
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm surprised you aren't addicted to it yet
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i guess i will be
 MSmits: at some point
 MSmits: it has crazy branching though
 jacek: and fow :unamused:
 MSmits: that is supposedly not much of a problem
 MSmits: as you can just calculate the most likely position of the opponent and do the search based on that assumption
 MSmits: thats what the pm's tell me anyway
 Kitkat260: hi guys
 MSmits: hi
 Kitkat260: is there any teens here
 Kitkat260: nvm
 MSmits: I am a Fteen next month
 MSmits: it's like a tween, but with forty
 Kitkat260: are u a teacher
 MSmits: yea
 jacek: what gave it away?
 Kitkat260: your proflie
 jacek: :spy:
 Westicles: Haha... and we rule the world
 MSmits: jacek, you use simd sometimes right?
 MSmits: does this function annoy the hell out of you too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#expand=2431,4963,2431,4963,4912,4912&amp;cats=Set&amp;text=_mm256_set_epi64x">https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#expand=2431,4963,2431,4963,4912,4912&amp;cats=Set&amp;text=_mm256_set_epi64x</a>
 MSmits: it's just... wrong
 MSmits: I get bugs because of this and I say the bug is on intel's side
 struct: what bug do you get?
 MSmits: the e indices are reversed
 MSmits: why would anyone do the largest index first
 MSmits: makes no sense
 jacek: i dont use simd or avx directly
 struct: __m256i _mm256_setr_epi64x
 jacek: never used _mm stuff
 struct: setr
 struct: should do the job right?=
 MSmits: so the reversed version is actually the normal version?
 struct: yes
 struct: and no
 MSmits: thats still lame :P
 struct: reversed shows the correct order
 MSmits: but thanks
 MSmits: i will use that now
 MSmits: jacek do you rely on autovectorization?
 MSmits: not sure how well it works
 jacek: i just hope it works
 MSmits: well i guess it doesnt matter that much as it is not your bottleneck anyway
 jacek: if not, then there's probably some 2x-3x speedup left for my bots
 MSmits: it's evaluating the networks
 MSmits: doubt it
 jacek: the eval takes most time for me
 MSmits: yeah so its not going to be 2x 3x
 MSmits: unless you could use the avx stuff in eval
 MSmits: and you arent
 MSmits: i was more talking about the sim part
 jacek: oh
 MSmits: thats where i use it, when i can
 jacek: if autovectorization doesnt work in my eval, then it would huge speedup
 MSmits: might be good to test it, you can do that with godbolt and such cant you?
 jacek: ever since i have my eval quite heavy, i dont care much about sim speed, aside its bitboarded
 MSmits: makes sense
 jacek: perhaps. i never really heavily analyzed the code and instructions
 MSmits: i dont usually either, but thats because i dont rely on the compiler that much
 MSmits: i micromanage too much :P
 MSmits: I think i have a bot somewhere that uses goto 
 MSmits: so i improved since then 
 jacek: goto oO
 MSmits: i think it was a fast way to get out of a nested loop
 ZarthaxX: MSmits why did you say that instruction saved in reverse order?
 ZarthaxX: pseudo code seems fine
 struct: setr(0,1,2,3) = [0,1,2,3]
 struct: set(0,1,2,3) = [3,2,1,0]
 struct: but pseudo code is fine you are right
 ZarthaxX: pseudo says e0 would be at lowest part
 ZarthaxX: that thing u put there would be array in memory or what
 struct: you can load an array
 struct: load or loadu for unaligned
 MSmits: ZarthaxX the code runs fine
 MSmits: the fact is, you put the e3 part in the leftmost part of the function call
 MSmits: so you're thinking you do set(0,1,2,3)
 MSmits: but you actually do set (3,2,1,0)
 struct: also msmits cant you load it as an array?
 MSmits: these are constants basically
 struct: set is a sequence as it says on intel site
 struct: ah ok
 MSmits: always the same, so i load them once
 struct: ok then its fine
 MSmits: just 256 bit masks
 struct: this is for what?
 MSmits: connect4&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm avxing the sim
 MSmits: horizontal, verical and diagonals all at once
 struct: this library is good
 jacek: :scream:
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/vectorclass/version2">https://github.com/vectorclass/version2</a>
 MSmits: seems i already had that favorited
 jacek: plot twist: smits made it
 MSmits: lol no
 Kitkat260: what happened
 MSmits: 2021
 Kitkat260: ik
 Kitkat260: where is jacek
 ZarthaxX: MSmits still dont get your confusion
 ZarthaxX: e3 in leftmost part for you would mean it should be highest number or lowest
 ZarthaxX: maybe you dont know how a simd register looks like
 MSmits: well it's like this
 MSmits: in my mind the 256 divided into 64 bit parts works like this
 Kitkat260: ummmm
 MSmits: if i load it like this Set(0,1,2,3)
 MSmits: the 0 comes in the low part, the 1 comes in the 2nd 64 bit part etc.
 MSmits: but thats not what happens
 ZarthaxX: ah
 Kitkat260: how many girls r here
 ZarthaxX: well register it just bits so the order is 3 2 1 0
 ZarthaxX: that's why thee convention
 MSmits: yeah, it's confusing
 ZarthaxX: of the call
 ZarthaxX: doesnt seem wrong
 MSmits: i'm sure there is a good reason for it, but when i am using it, in the context of the rest of my code, it seems wrong
 Astrobytes: fix it
 MSmits: i did
 MSmits: i added an R
 MSmits: setr
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 MSmits: then used a #define
 MSmits: so i dont see the r :P
 Astrobytes: lmao
 ZarthaxX: aight :P
 ZarthaxX: connect4 eval withbitboard had shift in different ways
 ZarthaxX: idk if you can do smth with avx
 MSmits: already did, works fine
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: why are you doing this btw
 MSmits: why wouldnt it work?
 MSmits: there's a connect4 contribution that will soon be approved i think
 MSmits: 9x7
 ZarthaxX: i dont remember if u had to do shift in different dirs
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 MSmits: you do
 MSmits: left right
 MSmits: up down
 MSmits: and diagonals
 ZarthaxX: well that'sa what i meanty
 ZarthaxX: cant do it all at once
 MSmits: there's 2 sets
 MSmits: you combine left with up, down with rigth etc.
 ZarthaxX: aight
 ZarthaxX: gud
 MSmits: earlier I thought the creator was messing around with the contribution because i kept getting errors with input
 MSmits: after a while I figured out i was pasting my bot into the Dots and boxes IDE
 Astrobytes: ffs :rofl:
 struct: lol
 MSmits: not the first time this happened
 struct: What happens if he increases the board size?
 Astrobytes: it gets bigger
 MSmits: if he increases it further, my avx thingy is screwed
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: it's neatly 63 bit now
 struct: I dont know how its possible, but Im atm reading some code
 MSmits: 9x7 apparently isnt solved so shouldbe ok
 struct: for AVX on puyo puyo
 struct: and its 12*6
 struct: so 72 bits
 MSmits: i'm sure it's possible, it just would be very inefficient
 MSmits: might still be faster than without it
 MSmits: you would have to split the process in two halves
 struct: First I need to understand the bitboard part
 MSmits: there's many ways to do it
 MSmits: mmh is there a faster way to get the highest set bit than this: 
 MSmits: int index = __builtin_clzl(col);			index = 63 - index;
 MSmits: i'm counting leading zeroes
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/puyoai/puyoai/tree/master/src/core">https://github.com/puyoai/puyoai/tree/master/src/core</a>
 MSmits: dont remember if you could get the highest set bit with a single instruction
 struct: its so much code
 MSmits: yeah]
 jacek: ctzl?
 MSmits: thats liwest set bit
 MSmits: lowest
 MSmits: for some reason  i made my connect4 bitboard to have the lowest part of the bitboard at the high bits
 MSmits: because it's input in that order i guess
 MSmits: maybe i should change that
 MSmits: wow i literally just reversed an iterator in the input reading part and the bot still works, now i can use ctz instead
 struct: I thought there wasnt modulo operator for m256i but there is
 struct: but its a sequence
 struct: so should not matter much
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm256_irem_epi32&amp;expand=3205">https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm256_irem_epi32&amp;expand=3205</a>
 struct: its for 32bits though
 MSmits: yay i am on the leaderboard. Just random moves and it takes the win when it can
 jacek: i will suggest bigger board :imp:
 MSmits: meanie
 jacek: bigger than 256
 darkhorse64: I have a mcts for C4 with solver. I even wrote an AVX2 win detection but it does not go faster than the x64 code. On my PC, it's nearly a 2x, 3M -&gt; 5.5M rollouts/s
 MSmits: nice one
 MSmits: thats odd, why wouldnt avx2 be faster?
 MSmits: also did you detect wins, or winning moves?
 MSmits: it's different
 MSmits: my function returns all moves that are winning
 darkhorse64: I suggested an octagon based C4 to make sure it is not solved. It would have taken more than 64 bits. 9x7 is solved as a win for White but good luck to find it in 100 ms. A book will probably help. I am curious how trictrac MM will perform. I detect wins. Next step is detecting winning positions for smarter rollouts
 MSmits: 9x7 is solved?
 darkhorse64: sec
 MSmits: i thought 6x7 was
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 Kitkat260: hey
 jacek: 9x7 its not far from 7x6
 Kitkat260: yep
 Kitkat260: it is
 darkhorse64: 42 moves against 63, the search space is much larger
 MSmits: it's like D&amp;B, 1 size large is like a factor of 30 or something in computation time
 Kitkat260: :sunglasses:
 MSmits: so that site says 7x9 is just barely out of range?
 jai_m: hey guys i have made project on face recognition, i would like you to check it out once it will help me to make it more better! please wait at the face-part as it will take time to load link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://smile-pay.herokuapp.com/">http://smile-pay.herokuapp.com/</a>
 Kitkat260: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: he will steal your face!!!
 MSmits: :P
 darkhorse64: re avx2 I have no explanation. I checked my code under windows, this is where my performance figures go from. On CG servers, I see no difference at all. I don't know why. I am doing the four in a row in all directions at the same time and I have no ifs. It should get better
 MSmits: hmm might be it autovectorizes
 MSmits: that would mean it does help, but you dont have to code it yourself
 Kitkat260: umm what r talking about
 MSmits: parallel calculation for bitboards in simulating boardgames
 darkhorse64: my bad: I misread the table. It is not solved. If it autovectorizes, it's a very smart compiler
 jacek: well MSmits has just got new title for his thesis
 jai_m: no MSmits im a college student, its okay if you dont want to put your face lol. but yeah it just a project 
 struct: __attribute__((optimize("no-tree-vectorize"))) to disable auto vectorization
 Kitkat260: is there teens here
 jai_m: if you want  i can send the link on github soo you can show that as your project in your college lol
 jacek: it wants my bank id o.O
 jacek: darn, where was my credit card...
 darkhorse64: If I want to enable it again (to limit the scope on one function)&#160;?
 Kitkat260: hi..
 struct: __attribute__((optimize("no-tree-vectorize")))void function() {}
 struct: should only affect that function
 darkhorse64: OK
 MSmits: I hope 7x9 is a draw
 MSmits: makes games more balanced
 MSmits: or it could anyway, no guarantee
 MSmits: some games are solved as a draw and still heavily advantaged for one side
 jai_m: all the details are fake enter every fake details
 MSmits: for example TTT
 jai_m: its just a dummy project
 darkhorse64: fierce battle ahead
 Kitkat260: sup guys
 MSmits: btw darkhorse64, if I continue to work on yavalath book i might push you to 2. I keep running into losses vs you when i submit
 MSmits: you have the best late game bot I think
 MSmits: and i can't book the lategame. I win most games, but when you navigate all the traps like my bot does, it's a tossup
 jacek: in other words it has no problems with premature finishing
 MSmits: :P
 darkhorse64: you're welcome. Not sure why: heavy rollouts maybe 
 MSmits: it's a feature of mcts i think
 MSmits: you playout the game till the end
 MSmits: which means you also detect when there's unfavorable placement that leads you without enough safe spots in the lategame
 MSmits: it's not that easy to do this in a minimax
 jacek: ad you pushed pony again
 MSmits: i did&#160;?
 jacek: hes above me
 MSmits: probably i just didnt fight it in my last submits
 MSmits: so i didnt push it, i dragged others down
 MSmits: I submit every once in a while, get 3 or 4 losses out of the submit and then check my meta mcts to see if there's anything interesting
 MSmits: usually the losses are trictrac, dafish or darkhorse
 Kitkat260: /me
 jacek: you dont automate those submits?
 jacek: go more meta
 MSmits: nah, i do this stuff by hand&#160;:)
 MSmits: i mean the meta also runs automatically, but it has a manual component
 MSmits: i just enter in the moves manually, see where it takes me
 MSmits: i guess euler would have already written a python script that downloaded all the moves and then reads them in from the meta mcts
 MSmits: i did not go quite that far
 MSmits: that heroku app of his does this sort of thing
 Kitkat260: how do you code so well
 MSmits: practice
 Kitkat260: ok...
 MSmits: not kidding, that's literally how
 MSmits: just do a lot
 Kitkat260: oh ok
 Kitkat260: has any body seen proogmr
 Kitkat260: nmv
 darkhorse64: Great, 5th again at Y but definitely losing too many short games
 MSmits: thats how it is for mcts bots
 MSmits: traps are hard
 Kitkat260: don't worry your not alone
 Kitkat260: i am having trouble too
 MSmits: darkhorse64 look at my recent battles
 MSmits: and you'll see what I'm talking about
 Kitkat260: gtg
 darkhorse64: You mean losing in the endgame&#160;? I could predict the on
 MSmits: i mean the only losses i have are vs you :P
 darkhorse64: result 11 moves before
 darkhorse64: You one loss in 18 moves. Hole in the book&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: fixed that
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: maybe&#160;:)
 MSmits: the 2 2 start is a bit difficult somehow
 MSmits: maybe because my meta mcts simulated over 2 million games with 3 2 start and only 500k with 2 2
 MSmits: because everyone else seems to use 3 2
 MSmits: well except dafish and tric trac
 darkhorse64: Games with supson are very short too
 MSmits: yeah i didnt really target him with any book
 darkhorse64: Looking at my book ...
 MSmits: i guess he just uses the same moves as others
 MSmits: there's a lot of overlap between bots
 darkhorse64: I mean my games
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: hm yeah it's so hard to get a bot to never lose in first 14 plies or so if you're not using a book
 MSmits: branching is insane
 MSmits: 60 X 59 x 58 etc.
 darkhorse64: My book is start with any hex within the second ring and steal the inner hexes
 MSmits: steal the inner hexes is pretty much the only steal that's certain to be good
 MSmits: being first has a huge disadvantage in that you need 1 more safespot for your hexes
 MSmits: or you lose to 3 in a row for lategame
 MSmits: so I have no idea if it's worth stealing the others
 MSmits: I steal 1 0, 2 1, 2 2 and the center ones
 MSmits: dont steal 0 0, 2 0, 1 1 and 3 2
 MSmits: these just have a &lt; 50% winrate for me, but that does not necessarily prove anything
 jai_m: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://smile-pay.herokuapp.com/">http://smile-pay.herokuapp.com/</a> give a look to this project i have made it enter all details dummy.
 darkhorse64: With EPT, I could bias my search towards triangles. My bot avoids these too much. Steal 1 0&#160;? Are you using the game coordinates&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: game coord
 MSmits: so the one next to the corner on the edge
 MSmits: dafish and trictrac open with it 
 MSmits: sometimes
 MSmits: seen jacek's pony do it too, lately I think
 jacek: i have the same opening as main
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: 1st move*, not book
 MSmits: so it's 1 0 and 3 2?
 MSmits: or maybe just random and i am seeing only losses with those as starting moves
 MSmits: biased on my end
 darkhorse64: Intuitively, starting on the border looks odd
 MSmits: yeah i know
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64413398-0622-46ee-abd4-8bc080eab5f0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64413398-0622-46ee-abd4-8bc080eab5f0</a>
 derjack: 1, 3, 59, 57, 13, 14, 15, 46, 14, 46, 45, 47, 46, 14 those are my starts
 darkhorse64: because you have less offensive moves at your disposal
 Astrobytes: jai_m: stop posting your link please
 MSmits: 1 and 3 are 1 0 start
 MSmits: 59 and 57 also
 MSmits: so yeah, good deal, it seems a balanced start
 MSmits: my meta is probably lopsided from counterbooking other players that start with it and i steal it
 jacek: actually i stole that from you
 jacek: good to have someone do the dirty job
 MSmits: haha yes
 MSmits: this is why i dont say "BOOK" when i play a book move, otherwise you could just steal the entire book
 MSmits: there arent that many moves to steal really
 Jrabovsky: array.pop() in python removes the first element right?
 zhoubou: The last element
 zhoubou: If you want to pop the first one, use array.pop(0)
 zhoubou: That is array.pop(index)
 Jrabovsky: I did that
 Jrabovsky: but it still returned the last element
 Jrabovsky: Ive been having issues with the IDE recently
 zhoubou: There has to be a problem with your code somewhere then
 zhoubou: What specific issues are you having?
 Jrabovsky: Recently ive been trying to perform operations that worked a week ago without the same result
 Jrabovsky: Just then would be an example of one where a.pop(0) gave me the wrong value
 zhoubou: Maybe a[0] is not what you expect it to be
 Jrabovsky: I printed the array before to check
 Jrabovsky: the order was 3,1,2 and a.pop(0) returned 2
 Westicles: thibaud is streaming
 zhoubou: How does one use CodinGame's pastebin?
 jrke: just paste your text it will automatically convert to pastebin if the content is big
 zhoubou: Oh, thanks.
 zhoubou: Jrabovsky check your code thoroughly, there has to be something you're missing. Perhaps you can share a snippet where it occurs, and surrounding code, so I can have a look?
 Jrabovsky: Alright. I wont be able to get the same test conditions as last time but Ill send something over next time it happens. Thanks so much
 jrke: is there any way to compress a string to a letter?
 zhoubou: Compress in what way? What is your goal?
 jrke: like encoding a string into a single letter
 jacek:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: that makes no sense whatsoever
 Westicles: I once fit the entire Holy Bible into the letter A
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jacek: char x = "x"[0]?
 jrke: i think i need rest my mind is exhausted atm due to complexity of D&amp;B
 MSmits: there are for sure easier games on cg
 MSmits: enjoying connect4 atm
 MSmits: join us
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud is live again
 jrke: i will join tommorow MS
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: hm, not in a stream-y mood today
 Astrobytes: puzzles again?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: tell him he should do multis instead :P
 Westicles: he seems like a really nice guy
 jrke: so Transpotiton tables are also usefull in connect4 i think
 eulerscheZahl: tell him yourself astro
 Astrobytes: I lack the motivation right now

 karimk123: hello everyone
 jacek: good evening
 karimk123: its night time for me but ill take it'
 karimk123: i got a new wpm today
 MSmits: weaponized personal message?
 Astrobytes: wombat petting machine?
 MSmits: ah ofc
 Zenoscave: word per microsecond
 Westicles: wife praise m...d
 karimk123: ah yes funally 100 words per microseconds

 MSmits: which contribution eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: 3D one
 MSmits: oh
 eulerscheZahl: my only pending atm
 MSmits: whats the reason?
 eulerscheZahl: Hey CodinGamer! Your contribution has unfortunately not been moderated on time and will temporarily be removed from the system... But no worries! You can republish it anytime to give it another chance!&#160;:)
 Westicles: i tried to get a mob together to approve last year, but they lacked vision
 eulerscheZahl: i want a proper review anyways
 eulerscheZahl: and now i'm pulling a JBM: camping on the contrib page
 MSmits: ye, dont use blind people Westicles
 Westicles: MSmits channeling jacek today?
 AnonymousUser: 0.00000133333 words per Microsecond&#160;: v
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 MSmits: eeeyup
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jacek: its ee, fix your ponyism
 MSmits: eeyup
 eulerscheZahl: ohai
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday's eve
 Astrobytes: oO
 zhoubou: AutomatonNN what is love
 AutomatonNN: wow, that's what i was solving anymore&#160;:(
 zhoubou: Did I remember correctly? :P
 Astrobytes: AutomatonNN baby don't hurt me
 AutomatonNN: ZarthaxX you work in a contest to see the code in between
 eulerscheZahl: finally
 eulerscheZahl: it's happening!
 Astrobytes: He pings a few others too
 eulerscheZahl: take that offline ZarthaxX
 jacek: AutomatonNN where is your database

 eulerscheZahl: was to be expected
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 jacek: AutomatonNN invalid paste id
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code in the chat&#160;?
 Astrobytes: it did that in fr the other day
 jacek: :tada:
 zhoubou: Omg
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: can i kick again?
 eulerscheZahl: was a nice day without automaton
 Astrobytes: I won't tell
 Astrobytes: Feel free
 eulerscheZahl: meh, I won't stay for long anyways
 Astrobytes: don't tell me your shaving another hour off your bedtime this year
 eulerscheZahl: no, you'll have to deal with me for 1 more hour or 1.5 maybe
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Westicles: what's the etiquette on changing the difficulty of an existing puzzle?
 Astrobytes: Can you do it?
 Astrobytes: As in, is it possible I mean
 Westicles: Seems like you can
 Astrobytes: This is for the nuggets thing right
 Westicles: yeah.  I wouldn't do it myself due to... people disliking everything I do... but someone else could
 eulerscheZahl: nugget numbers?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: could be interesting with larger limits, would require some maths. with given constraints it's easy to bruteforce
 eulerscheZahl: (didn't try, just my feeling)
 Astrobytes: I only had a quick look after Westicles comment on the forum
 Astrobytes: It doesn't seem to fit the 'hard' category as it is
 Westicles: that would be a fun stream.  fixing the difficulty on a bunch of puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: as a creator of hard puzzles I feel insulted by this categorization
 Astrobytes: Hah! A fair few of them got a bit mixed up when they mixed the official puzzles with the community
 eulerscheZahl: the auto assignment of difficulties
 Astrobytes: what was it based on? Number of solvers?
 JBM: there wouldn't be so much camping if you just solved freecell eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: there's an "impossible" testcase
 eulerscheZahl: did you disable autoplay yet?
 Astrobytes: damn, I forgot about that one as well. So many bloody contributions
 eulerscheZahl: the binary tree is gone already&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: hope it will return
 Astrobytes: The solo game?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/43687cd854d10e38c3716e6d08efe735b42f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/43687cd854d10e38c3716e6d08efe735b42f</a>
 JBM: pretty sure it will
 eulerscheZahl: mouton is here for some years, so chances are good
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: I am not a big fan of this one
 Stilgart: he has better puzzles to publish
 eulerscheZahl: i had fun solving it. i also remember the crossing lines one
 eulerscheZahl: which is still on my TODO&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: wrote some code but something is still wrong there
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: dwarfie and I are sceptical about nuggets in hard
 Stilgart: we spoke about it on #fr this afternoon
 eulerscheZahl: we can argue about medium because of the -1 at best
 Stilgart: is it that obvious that a naive while loop will be fast enough&#160;?
 Stilgart: proving it is not that easy imho (but it is not required to solve the puzzle)
 eulerscheZahl: simple while loop gets you somewhere around 1e9
 eulerscheZahl: an obvious upper limit for the array size is package size squared
 eulerscheZahl: multiply by number of packages
 Stilgart: 1e7 (not everyone uses C++)
 eulerscheZahl: which makes it a bad selection on constraints even
 eulerscheZahl: i think it could be interesting with higher constraints
 Stilgart: not so obvious
 eulerscheZahl: something with pairwise LCM i think
 eulerscheZahl: didn't completely think it through
 Westicles: Go ahead and change it to medium at least
 eulerscheZahl: i see it as the task of creator/approvers to do so and only take action if they obviously don't care anymore
 Westicles: well, it was djoums...
 eulerscheZahl: another topic: where did the autoplay disable button on youtube go?
 Stilgart: well, it was Westicles complaining in the forum...
 eulerscheZahl: i hate that autoplay and now i can't figure out how to turn it off
 Stilgart: wait wait wait...
 Stilgart: please no
 Stilgart: I still have one in the upper right
 Stilgart: (you almost killed me there)
 eulerscheZahl: player on the left, autoplay top right?
 eulerscheZahl: not for me. maybe ctrl+F5?
 eulerscheZahl: still missing&#160;:/
 Stilgart: autoplay button on the right, still there after a ctrl+shift+R (firefow 84)
 Stilgart: s/w/x/
 Astrobytes: seems fine if you're logged in
 Stilgart: seems that autoplay is enabled by default, though
 Astrobytes: but disappears for me if I'm not
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/wea1p7">https://prnt.sc/wea1p7</a>where should it be?
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: no way I am logged in
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i never log in on youtube&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: they are collecting enough data without me helping them
 Westicles: are you talking about autoplaying the next video?  They moved it into the video itself.
 Stilgart: juste below the sign in button
 Stilgart: -e
 Astrobytes: yeah I have a single gmail for youtube purposes
 Westicles: over by full screen
 Stilgart: I do not have a gmail account
 eulerscheZahl: aaah, found it
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Westicles
 Astrobytes: Ah got it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/wea2su">https://prnt.sc/wea2su</a>
 Astrobytes: Sorry, I was on a playlist
 Stilgart: wow, what trickery is this&#160;?!
 Astrobytes: they are really messing with us
 eulerscheZahl: we haven't redesigned the site for a while, let's confuse the users again
 jacek: ux, apparently
 eulerscheZahl: i still miss the star reviews
 eulerscheZahl: (i admit it's easier to affect with stars than thumbs)
 Astrobytes: ux these days tends more and more towards mobile with scant regard for users on computer
 eulerscheZahl: as in: a 1 star on a highly rating video has more power. still I want the stars back
 Stilgart: stars only last a few second, not worth it
 Stilgart: &lt;/mario&gt;
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Westicles: i made the mistake of clicking on lithuanian girls pole vaulting.  now that's all I get
 Astrobytes: :no_mouth:
 jai_m: im a college student i have made a project on face-recognition please have a look on it (note: enter all dummy details while signup) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://smile-pay.herokuapp.com/">http://smile-pay.herokuapp.com/</a>
 MSmits: I thought of several things I could say to that Westicles, but then I remembered I am a teacher and this chat is public
 MSmits: :P
 eulerscheZahl: just do it, none of your students is here
 Astrobytes: jai_m: if you continue posting that I will kick you from chat. That's the 3rd time in a couple of hours.
 MSmits: I'll just wait for jacek to reply
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Astrobytes, was considering such a reply too
 Astrobytes: Rather annoying.
 jacek: hmm? what reply
 MSmits: to westicles
 jai_m: okay im sorry
 jai_m: i wont do that again&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: jacek would be more interested in Lithuanian pony vaulting :P
 Astrobytes: Thank you jai_m
 jacek: yes, most my youtube related stuff are mlp, anime and neural nets
 MSmits: lol Astrobytes
 jacek: would you think google by now won't see the difference between ponies and multi-layer perceptrons?
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: Ponies in 2021?
 jacek: mods are asleep, postponies
 Illedan: ETA on moving chess out of WIP reCurse?
 Astrobytes: best new years wishes for you Illedan, reCurse
 Illedan: You2
 Illedan: Got any new years resolutions?
 jacek: 1920x1200 as the last one
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: not even 16:9
 Illedan: :joy:
 Astrobytes: Nah, I don't make them tbh
 Astrobytes: When I want to make a change I go for it
 reCurse: All the best to you as well Astrobytes
 reCurse: And happy new year
 eulerscheZahl: mine is not to wake up when neighbors go nuts
 Illedan: Go nuts? As in fighting?
 eulerscheZahl: fireworks
 Astrobytes: Let me introduce the concept of: earplugs
 struct: mine is to finish stc
 reCurse: I think I'll publish chess soon enough and scrap crazyhouse
 eulerscheZahl: you need 2 more accounts for that struct
 Illedan: Define finish?
 struct: finish my bot
 reCurse: Don't think I'll do any more modifications though
 Illedan: Why scrap crazyhouse?
 Astrobytes: ^
 reCurse: Definitely not popular
 Illedan: But yeah, I kinda agree. Crazyhouse is hella confusing :P
 eulerscheZahl: that's the whole point of it
 Astrobytes: the clue is kinda in the name tbh
 eulerscheZahl: so you have less research done already
 struct: Release one and keep other in WIP
 jacek: will there be a boss in chess?
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: I've moved on to another project and lost interest in chess for the time being
 eulerscheZahl: you need one for puzzle of the week
 jacek: ^
 reCurse: ffs
 eulerscheZahl: it will tripple your player count
 Illedan: I can make you a boss for chess if you want?
 reCurse: Why does it need a boss
 Illedan: To have a funnier top league
 eulerscheZahl: promotion = quest completion
 eulerscheZahl: solve the puzzle
 jacek: also it would filter out random and crashing bots
 reCurse: I can't think of anything nice to say as a response, so I'll leave it at that
 Westicles: I'm still looking for my second bronze
 eulerscheZahl: and filter crashing player for higher league
 jacek: boss could be just 2-ply material
 reCurse: Can't even blob all the referee code because of the stupid 1 class java restriction, unless copy/pasting everything as inner class works somehow?
 jacek: you can have multiple classes in java
 eulerscheZahl: you can't create objects from a static context
 eulerscheZahl: at least that's something I struggled with
 jacek: you meant referee or bot?
 eulerscheZahl: somehow it worked to create an object of the class containing the main function. and then objects of other types in the constructor
 eulerscheZahl: just Java
 reCurse: Well I would have blobbed the referee code into a bot file
 reCurse: Then just do a 1-ply search with material evel
 reCurse: *eval
 eulerscheZahl: i don't remember the exact details. only that it totally confused me why it isn't working the way I want
 reCurse: Yeah I feel the same way about java
 reCurse: Intuitions are all wrong because arbitrary reasons
 Astrobytes: I find the language fairly horrifying to be perfectly honest.
 eulerscheZahl: too bad that android decided to build on java and not C#
 reCurse: If only we could somehow fix the timeline and have microsoft start with .net core
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they were a few years too early to see the benefits of C#
 reCurse: Java would have died and the world be a better place
 Illedan: ^
 Astrobytes: But... then millions of devices wouldn't be running Java!!!!
 Astrobytes: ...
 eulerscheZahl: billions*
 Astrobytes: eugh
 Westicles: I have a grudge against Oracle.  They retracted an internship offer when they figured out I wasn't a CS major
 eulerscheZahl: i'm only mad at booking.com
 Astrobytes: But you'd presumably demonstrated your capabilities otherwise Westicles?
 Westicles: Yeah, the interview went fine
 eulerscheZahl: what is your major in?
 Westicles: EE
 eulerscheZahl: and did you say it is in CS first?
 Westicles: no
 Astrobytes: Or did you have EE + CS
 Astrobytes: But they only wanted CS major
 eulerscheZahl: so, they invited you, interview and then: btw what are your qualifications?
 reCurse: I'm more surprised they actually said a reason
 eulerscheZahl: i had a (new retired) colleague who accidentally got the job
 Westicles: Yeah, it was all kind of weird.  They were just down the street so no big deal
 eulerscheZahl: applied at another company in a foreign city. asked someone "how can I get to company CYZ"?
 eulerscheZahl: "just follow those people, they all go there"
 eulerscheZahl: walked into the wrong building, no interview scheduled. got the job :D
 Illedan: lol
 Astrobytes: lol really?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, long ago when everyone desperately searched for qualified employees
 Astrobytes: Epic.
 eulerscheZahl: good old Walter. almost broke your hand every morning while greeting you :D
 Astrobytes: Oh. I'm one of those people. I can't help it.
 reCurse: Controlling competition, can't code as fast if the hand hurts
 Astrobytes: I was brought up to always have a firm handshake as a mark of sincerity.
 Astrobytes: lol reCurse
 MSmits: hey, with player messages, the message is supposed to stay up during the opponents turn right?
 MSmits: in connect 4, it turns off 
 jacek: make a comment in the contribution
 MSmits: yeah doing that
 eulerscheZahl: no one will get pinged as the creator doesn't exist anymore
 MSmits: huh?
 Astrobytes: not that connect4
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: and i was just wondering that connect4 has messages but no avatars
 eulerscheZahl: which other connect4?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59458ca85b08f914f150d1ccf0350fe7b233">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59458ca85b08f914f150d1ccf0350fe7b233</a>
 MSmits: it's  7x9
 eulerscheZahl: i totally missed that
 eulerscheZahl: too many clashes and some other things slip through
 MSmits: definitely hard to spot things in that list
 MSmits: it needs a multiplayer filter
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes check discord, #general
 eulerscheZahl: oh, gone already :D
 eulerscheZahl: did you delete it?
 Astrobytes: nope, what?
 eulerscheZahl: the herokuapp student advertised there as well
 Astrobytes: Oh I told him to put a link there to stop him posting here
 Astrobytes: Is it a malicious project?
 Astrobytes: I didn't actually click it
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't check either
 Astrobytes: He put it in #talk about anything
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i muted that channel
 reCurse: It's funny for the wrong reasons
 reCurse: He spammed it in 3 channels, deleted it everywhere except taah
 reCurse: Should have been in memes though
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: he deleted or you deleted?
 reCurse: I did
 jai_m: it is not malicious guys come on
 jai_m: you guys just dont value things
 struct: Well advertising it everywhere
 struct: is sketchy
 Astrobytes: OK, just don't spam it in 3 channels at one time then
 reCurse: I value things accordingly
 jai_m: i just want reviews on it there are no ads on it just dont call it meme or anything like that
 reCurse: Oh so it's actually serious
 reCurse: I'll leave that to kinder souls then
 jai_m: if you guys feel you only know the things and you all are advance in all these things then you will not give chances to other peoples 
 Astrobytes: Just one more thing: why is it called smile-pay, has a signup and login and is also about image recognition?
 <b>**Astrobytes removes Columbo coat</b></p><p><img src="/a/54241606493073" /> reCurse: Actually had to check if it was a flash app
 jai_m: it is a face-recognition project where i have used face-api library and used node for backend and monogdb for database and html-css for front-end
 jai_m: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jai38/Smile-Pay">https://github.com/jai38/Smile-Pay</a> see the github link and find any malicious thing on it
 Astrobytes: OK, calm down. For testing purposes in the manner you require I would strongly suggest disabling the signup/login features.
 jai_m: it has nothing to do with your actual details i already told enter dummy details if you are trying though
 Astrobytes: I mean, which part do you want feedback on?
 Astrobytes: If it's just the facial-recognition part then just test that part, not sure why you need external testing for that
 jai_m: i have done many things not only the face part, like for login signup passwords are hashed and this is my first project where i connected to database 
 jai_m: coz it is complete module of an payment app
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you told us to enter dummy data. but we are lazy and you have to motivate us. sign up? I have to make something up just to see if I care. *closes tab*
 reCurse: You have a login form for a payment app served in https with stretched out images using Comic Sans
 reCurse: How is that not a meme
 Astrobytes: Well, if you want feedback on that part it looks terrible for starters.
 reCurse: *http
 eulerscheZahl: that's how my mind works when I have some other tabs open
 jai_m: it is just a dummy project guys if you feel it as meme its okay let it be
 Westicles: turn it into a carefully crafted contribution and we'll get right on it in 60-180 days
 reCurse: That's as nice as it gets
 Astrobytes: Having road-tested that thing a little bit up to some point in the neverending signup process, I would recommend throwing it in the trash. Quickly.
 reCurse: Convert it to flash for meme points though, I'd give it 10/10
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 jai_m: alright, thanks for your views on it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up again on the mobile number. not even sure how it should be formed. is that different in other countries?
 Astrobytes: Also, it seems to be India-specific, which makes it kind of hard for non-Indian users 
 Astrobytes: Remove the 0 or the +CC eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: meh, rage quit
 eulerscheZahl: 123456 didn't work (probably too short)
 Astrobytes: it tells you the required length
 reCurse: Then definitely don't try this eulerscheZahl <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://userinyerface.com/">https://userinyerface.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: inyerface?
 reCurse: It's actually genius
 reCurse: I love it

 Astrobytes: that's HCI/UX hell right there
 Astrobytes: "in your face" eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: had to look at the source code to get to the next level
 eulerscheZahl: yes, got that Astrobytes :D
 reCurse: That's cheating
 Astrobytes: It's unbelievably realistic.
 eulerscheZahl: that slow scrolling of the help box when you send it :D
 Astrobytes: and the unstoppable timer

 Astrobytes: Well. It gave me this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ebay.com/i/193213712423">https://www.ebay.com/i/193213712423</a>
 reCurse: That's enough internet for today
 Astrobytes: Seriously.
 eulerscheZahl: yes, why are you posting that when i want to go to bed?
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm stuck under the cat anyways
 Astrobytes: I'm killing both of mine mentally as they're causing mayhem and destruction.
 MSmits: beat your bot darkhorse64. I get around 2M sims in first turn (9 sims  for each rollout)
 darkhorse64: 3.2 M for me
 MSmits: lower than yours, but might be the sim is heavier, or i should just optimize more
 MSmits: takes multiple submits to pull you down now lol
 MSmits: so few games
 darkhorse64: heavy rollouts (play wins, avoid losses)&#160;?
 MSmits: i dont even play wins
 MSmits: my sims only draw or lose
 MSmits: if you cant play a move that is not losing, you lose
 MSmits: basically, i calculate winning moves for the opponent. If there are more than 1, you lose
 MSmits: if you cant block it without giving him a winning move, you also lose
 MSmits: it's similar to the way beginners play connect4. Just avoid giving the opponent a win
 Astrobytes: connect4?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Oh I see your last statement
 MSmits: it solves really early, this game
 MSmits: 20 plies before the end with a mcts solver
 MSmits: makes sense, with so many columns becoming disallowed
 Astrobytes: board size increase needed? Or octagonal as darkhorse64 suggested?
 MSmits: not needed imho.
 MSmits: othello solves around 18 before the end
 Astrobytes: cool beans
 MSmits: well ofc opening books will wreck this game, but that was a given
 darkhorse64: Now that I have a serious bot to play with, I see this early solve too
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: the message turning off is annoying, hope he fixs it
 darkhorse64: post a request, the author is responsive and very pleased to get feedback
 MSmits: I did
 MSmits:  like you, i wonder how minimax bots will do against ours
 MSmits: not that easy to eval this i think?
 MSmits: I'm guessing you count possible 4 ina rows or something
 darkhorse64: The C4 solver does something like that to order the moves 
 MSmits: ah ok
 darkhorse64: It takes several seconds to find the win with 6x7. Hope it will be enough to confuse MM bots
 darkhorse64: You wrecked me. I have been #1 just one day
 MSmits: plenty of time to think of improvements
 MSmits: the key is heavier rollouts as you said
 MSmits: no reason to give away wins during a sim
 MSmits: it's like yavalath
 darkhorse64: One third of my Y bot is for the rollouts
 MSmits: you mean the lines of code?
 darkhorse64: yes
 MSmits: that makes sense
 MSmits: I have a lot of lines for generating all the lookup tables
 MSmits: but the sim has a lot too
 darkhorse64: lot of ugly lines
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: found a bug in connect 4
 MSmits: if you win with the last move, it says it's a draw
 MSmits: he obviously placed the draw-check before the win-check
 MSmits: I am also a little worried about the amount of times my p1 bot beats my p2 bot. As in... almost always
 MSmits: I guess i might just be deterministic
 MSmits: This game might need a steal option
 MSmits: maybe not, not sure
 struct: MSmits tell me if this makes any sense
 struct: this is google translated from japanese
 struct: Speeding up field implementation by bitboard The field is 6 rows wide, 14 rows vertically including the invisible part. If you put the wall up, down, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31ccf947-1e5f-480e-9559-6e600f4031b0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31ccf947-1e5f-480e-9559-6e600f4031b0</a>
 MSmits: not to me no
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: probably would need to study this hard to know what it's about
 MSmits: also translated out of Japanese =  a bad start
 struct: Well from the code I read they do store all the colors and skulls on 3 128 bits xmm
 struct: so 5 in 3
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: looks painfully complicated
 MSmits: connect4 was a breeze to avx
 struct: MSmits still there?
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: was about to go to bed, why?
 MSmits: struct
 struct: i think i found another good article on it
 struct: I share it tomorrow
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: gn then&#160;:)
 struct: gn
 LPTFabio: How i report a bug about "coders Strike back" in some game my bot finishes in first but it counts as a lost (against the boss)
 LPTFabio: nvm
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: how do I raise/drop my clash of code score?
 Wontonimo: play more clash of code
 Wontonimo: your score is pretty much as high as it can get.  There are a few more points for you to get, but it doesn't go above 5000 XP.  If you want more XP you'll need to play other competitions, like the Bot Programming.

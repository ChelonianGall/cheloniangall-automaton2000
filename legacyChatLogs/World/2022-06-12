 Tanvir: Is there a way to check how my bot perform against another bot in the same league with any rank? I know in the IDE there is a option the add another bot but it is limited to first 1000 bots of the league
 TimothyAlexisVass: :taco: flatypus
 flatypus: :hamburger:
 jacek: Tanvir only if you follow them
 struct: even then they need to be on top 1k of your league
 jacek: oh
 MasterOfKotlin: did anyone know how to play the mad pod racing?
 Mugrim_FF: I Did
 jacek: did you win
 MasterOfKotlin: can I know how do I defeat boss 3 and boss 4?
 jacek: is this nextCheckpointY, nextCheckpointY issue?
 MasterOfKotlin: I just wanna know how to put the boost
 MasterOfKotlin: is it an if else before the angle or after it?
 jacek: you print it instead of thrust. so instead of x y 100 you print x y BOOST
 MasterOfKotlin: jacek it should be nextCheckpointX, nextCheckpointY
 jacek: i know, thats was the very first tutorial in mad pod racing
 MasterOfKotlin: ya ya
 MasterOfKotlin: how about the boss 4?
 jacek: anyway, you can use boost only once and you would want to use it when you are far from next checkpoint
 MasterOfKotlin: ya then I should calculate the distance to use the boost is it?
 jacek: yes. something like distance &gt; 5000, use boost
 MasterOfKotlin: but the distance will always change depence on the circumstances so what is the better value for the distance?
 jacek: "far enough"

 MasterOfKotlin: the second 1 is my whole code
 MasterOfKotlin: but at some condition I still lose
 MasterOfKotlin: do I wrote it wrongly?
 jacek: 8000 is alright
 jacek: but nextCheckpointAngle == 0, does it ever happen exactly?
 jacek: also if (nextCheckpointAngle &lt; 90 || nextCheckpointAngle &gt; -90) is always true no matter what
 eulerscheZahl: but is it always double-true?
 jacek: or maybe not if nextCheckpointAngle is float ~
 eulerscheZahl: NaN
 eulerscheZahl: yurkov spammed reCurse back to 2nd at STC
 jacek: reCurse? never heard of her
 YurkovAS: is it problem?
 eulerscheZahl: no. just because i mentioned it yesterday but at that point it was already gone again
 eulerscheZahl: so jacek didn't believe me

 struct: Do I need to watch the entire thing to understand it?
 jacek: nah you can skip to the near end
 eulerscheZahl: i only use Chokudai on Code of the Realm. but works well there too
 khanglovesIT: can you guys recommend me a game in bot programming pls. i don't know what to choose
 DomiKo: have you tried Line Racing?
 khanglovesIT: ok thanks, i haven't tried it
 eulerscheZahl: almost all are good
 jacek: except onitama
 struct: its mostly personal preference
 eulerscheZahl: onitama is good. tower dereference is my big fail as a contributor
 jacek: how so
 eulerscheZahl: too ambitious, would need a lot of testing and balancing

 TINOUAINANI: Hello
 TimothyAlexisVass: :taco: jacek
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 andyyyyy: i can't seem to get used to javascript after using python for so long
 eulerscheZahl: you can always learn Brython instead
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.brython.info/">https://www.brython.info/</a>
 jacek: does it include tensorflow
 jacek: doesnt even support numpy :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because numpy uses some C++?
 eulerscheZahl: but should be doable to add with WASM :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: not my problem, Blazor works fine any my language of choice is C# anyways

 AryanTripathi: ty
 AryanTripathi: sure
 AryanTripathi: btw 5DN1L thanks for your reviews&#160;:)
 AryanTripathi: can we create a community contest?
 jacek: no
 AryanTripathi: sed
 eulerscheZahl: but you can create a complex game with animations and all that
 AryanTripathi: yep ik
 jacek: and burn people gpu
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you need those polygons to make it look good
 MaxCol06: salut

 eulerscheZahl: i invite you to #debut don't ruin it
 eulerscheZahl: our final chain before chat dies forever
 AryanTripathi: please keep the chat neat and clean by speaking in english :pray:
 colmax06: why
 AryanTripathi: it looks messy to me ig
 struct: Well in this chat you should only speak in English
 AryanTripathi: yep true
 struct: There is #fr chat if you want to speak french
 colmax06: no because it is a chat for the world
 AryanTripathi: let me join it lmao
 GlennMike: is we get paid if make a clash?
 AryanTripathi: nah
 AryanTripathi: but if it gets accepted you get XP
 AryanTripathi: if its first time
 eulerscheZahl: you always get 250XP for an approved contribution and 10XP for an upvote. but that's it
 eulerscheZahl: back when we had community contests, you would get a 40x30cm canvas with the contest cover. i miss those days
 struct: you misspelled €
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to get paid, try codechef or codeforces
 AryanTripathi: ohh
 eulerscheZahl: but they also expect some quality for the problems
 AryanTripathi: I thought you get XP on the first time
 eulerscheZahl: always
 AryanTripathi: :thumbsup:
 struct: maybe if you add ads to the contribution you can get paid or something
 struct: but maybe the license doesn't allow it
 eulerscheZahl: don't give them stupid ideas
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: just mine BTC like i do at Dice Duel
 struct: floats seem to be giving me problems on pcr&#160;:/
 struct: When 2 chips collide at the same time on a wall
 eulerscheZahl: a few inaccuracies in the sim are acceptable
 struct: Is performance required for legend?
 eulerscheZahl: not that much
 struct: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: 95% correct sim and a bit of eval
 eulerscheZahl: legend isn't that hard, really
 struct: I heard people do a few moves then let game play a bit more turns and then eval
 eulerscheZahl: there are way more brutal legends. like COIF and xmas rush
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i do at least
 struct: I still have no idea how to make a bot for COIF
 eulerscheZahl: 6 turns with action, 4 with idle or so
 eulerscheZahl: and i think i mutate only 1 droplet each turn and keep the plan for the others
 eulerscheZahl: but too long ago, not sure
 struct: do you sim opponent?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, uh, hmm
 eulerscheZahl: let me check
 jacek: you dont know what you copy pasted?
 eulerscheZahl: when did wlesavo get so good at the game?
 jacek: jun 05, 2002
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i predict the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: or try at least
 struct: ok, thanks
 BH-Empire: how does clash of code work im confused :C
 AryanTripathi: what's the problem:?
 BH-Empire: I don't know how to solve them
 BH-Empire: I learned coding though
 AryanTripathi: hmm you meant they are a bit hard to solve
 eulerscheZahl: you could try easy puzzles first, they are without time pressure
 AryanTripathi: yup true
 AryanTripathi: btw eulersche you were mod right/
 AryanTripathi:&#160;?
 BH-Empire: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: yes, around the beginning of the year. i spend less time on CG now, so i opted to return the badge
 eulerscheZahl: but we parted ways on good terms
 AryanTripathi: ohh
 jacek: he got severance pay of 1 year salary
 rymark: go go go go
 rymark: fast clash&#160;!!!
 AryanTripathi: what
 jacek: :upside_down:
 VizGhar: Hey guys, any info about next contest except official ones :P
 jacek: you saw that video probably <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUuyE1GkhOo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUuyE1GkhOo</a>
 VizGhar: hmm not yet
 DomiKo: sooo, after a year it turns out that my solved for draws is bugged...
 struct: What was the bug?
 DomiKo: I had variable in node for how many children were solved. And if it was equal to number of children, the node was solved too. But it turns out that depending on select implementation I could select solved node more than once...
 DomiKo: so sometimes when node has one draw children it was draw too
 struct: oh you didnt check if the other were draws or loses
 DomiKo: some children were still unsolved, and I marked node as draw
 struct: yeah
 DomiKo: I wonder if that will solve my problems with Oware
 struct: does this influence NN training?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: but a lott
 DomiKo: I found this in Connect4, when my bot solved game in first turn as a draw
 struct: lucky
 jacek: :scream:
 DomiKo: ohhh boy, it's loking good at C4
 struct: o.o
 DomiKo: but my MCTS is still much stronger&#160;:(
 DomiKo: but we will see in some hours
 struct: your arena is still mcts?
 DomiKo: btw struct thank you for that thing with losing moves
 DomiKo: yeah it is
 struct: np
 DomiKo: I added this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/09-anticipate-losing-moves/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/09-anticipate-losing-moves/</a>
 DomiKo: and went from ~25 to ~15
 struct: Did it help?
 struct: Nice
 YurkovAS: without avx
 DomiKo: number of iterations dived down, but it helped a lot
 DomiKo: yes without
 struct: I dont exacly have that one
 struct: mine doesnt check if I place a piece and opponent places on top of it
 DomiKo: why not?
 DomiKo: too hard to use avx?
 struct: nah
 DomiKo: or is it just too slow?
 struct: my bot just did worse with it
 DomiKo: ohh ok
 struct: I can share the avx but I dont think it helps much
 struct: it helps it terms of performance
 struct: you will get probably 50% more rollouts
 YurkovAS: avx is the most interesting part of this multi for me :smiley:
 struct: do you use avx anywhere else on it?
 struct: or only for antecipating losing moves?
 YurkovAS: only in getPossibleWinMoves
 struct: There is plenty of tricks for optimization on this game
 struct: like updating move_mask with mask = (mask + (511ULL * pdep)) &amp; 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
 YurkovAS: i'm think Vintarel and mlomb use alpha-beta, just look at debug mesgs
 struct: Im suprised it does that well
 YurkovAS: next moves mask?moves ^= maskmoves |= (mask &gt;&gt; 9)for me
 struct: to calculate all moves the first time I use 
 struct: const uint64_t flipped = ~(boards[0] | boards[1]);return (flipped ^ (flipped &lt;&lt; 9)) &amp; 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
 struct: There are probably better ways
 struct: My code is a bit old
 YurkovAS: i'm store moves mask in state
 struct: oh
 struct: do you have opening book?
 YurkovAS: nothing more
 struct: Nice, my book is just 1ULL &lt;&lt; 7
 YurkovAS: i'm don't use first move hard code in any multi. even in uttt
 struct: wow
 struct: I use it on c4 and uttt
 wlesavo: im just not very active on the world chat eulerscheZahl, in ru we have our own meta, and last have a year i basically start one game after another, i think it been around 7-8 legend with close to top20 finish for this period

 AliTalbi: hi all 
 AliTalbi: is there anyone who passed the test from societe generale ^^&#160;? 
 AliTalbi: thank you in advance 
 AliTalbi: its for a developer role *
 Troph: which test&#160;?
 AliTalbi: its a techincal assessment they send as part of the recruitment process ^^
 Troph: ah no sorry, never heard of that
 Troph: I am kind of new here
 struct: I guess they use cg work for tests
 Troph: Yes I guess so, I just learnt that they were a main partner of CG
 struct: There will be a sponsored contest by them this week
 struct: here
 Troph: AliTalbi, if you want to train I'd suggest you do some easy and medium puzzles and then try the certification for your languauge
 AliTalbi: Thank you @Troph 
 Troph: the certification are timed and you can only do each language once in 30days
 AliTalbi: Okey perfect i will try it then&#160;;) 
 struct: When i did certification it took around 15 minutes
 AliTalbi: How about the hard puzzles, i saw that they're really at another level compared to the medium ones
 struct: Not sure if the difficulty change
 AliTalbi: okey noted ^^
 AliTalbi: i will try the certification then 
 AliTalbi: thank you guys will you participate to the bot challenge&#160;? 
 struct: Yes I will
 struct: Some puzzles here are quite difficult, at least for me
 Troph: and also check the employers side, the link is in the tab on top of the screen. you will learn some things about how the tests works
 struct: But I'm not a big fan of puzzles, I prefer coding bots
 AliTalbi: héhé feel ya

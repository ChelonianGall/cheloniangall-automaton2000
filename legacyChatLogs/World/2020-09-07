 Uljahn: k bye, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i wish there was a way to check for timeouts
 chinaredclif: gregory&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 advice on bender 4?
 Automaton2000: you have a better bot
 chinaredclif: Xedux&#160;?
 Xedux: what&#160;?
 Xedux: chinaredclif&#160;?
 chinaredclif: can u give ur resolution of the clash code&#160;?

 Katannee3: hello
 Katannee3: anyone?
 jacek: ohai
 Katannee3: konichiwa
 jacek: how may we help you, Sir/Madam
 jrke: which is current PotW
 Gangplank: hey guys, how to do combos on Pudge?
 black_ghost: hello all
 Gangplank: pls give me some help, i literally cant aim with hook
 Xedux: SuperMuppet&#160;?
 Xedux: can you send the answer&#160;?
 Xedux: of recent clash
 Xedux: nth sequence&#160;?
 AntiSquid: Gangplank are you talking about DotA 2&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: or did you mean botters of the galaxy&#160;? 
 Gangplank: i mean dota 2
 Katannee3: \\\\\\\

 Uljahn: pls stop flooding
 A_Potato: ok
 A_Potato: bye
 AntiSquid: Gangplank well this isn't a dota 2 website so most people won't know how to help you. As for the pudge hook, practice. I am sure you realize the top players are practicing almost 24/7 It's a hard game
 LinhT.Nguyen: xD
 AntiSquid: what MMR are you at Gangplank&#160;?
 MSmits: mmh so yesterday it was clash of clans and now people are talking about dota 2
 MSmits: methinks CG is advertising on the wrong platforms
 jrke: hey Ms
 MSmits: hey jrke
 MSmits: working on transposition tables now for my solver
 MSmits: when that is done I can start putting it into my real bot
 jrke: okay
 MSmits: assuming i can get the solve time low enough
 MSmits: currently I can do 200 endgames in a few seconds, but a single game can take a full second still
 MSmits: TT might take that down below 100 ms, maybe even as low as 10 ms if I am lucky
 jrke: yeah some are complicated
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: I also am not sure if all my heuristics are correct and my solver is bugfree. At some point you cant check it by hand anymore
 MSmits: sometimes i test a new heuristic and it works in 199 out of 200 games
 jacek: so make moves to avoid that 1 game
 jrke: yeah it can happen cause in some cases humans are better than bot and if you succeed to fix that then just greed more&#160;:)
 MSmits: jacek I actually considered that, that might even be viable. But if you know exactly what causes the difference then you can also just improve the heuristic
 MSmits: but sometimes the difference can be caused by many different thingst hat are all rare
 jrke: my code in arena is taking maximum 17 ms for a turn
 jrke: thats only in few turns else its &lt; 8ms
 MSmits: hmm yes, but it doesnt search to end of game when you're into the endgame does it?
 MSmits: like at ply 55, does it always solve?
 jrke: nope
 MSmits: ah ok, my idea is that it should always do that. So far I havent succeeded, but i am getting closer
 MSmits: TT with graphs is complicated
 jrke: my idea is bit different when i play a move in minimax i play that whole chain except last two boxes and then transfer it to next depth
 MSmits: yes but sometimes it's better to take all boxes
 jrke: with value addition of chain
 MSmits: hmm also, when it's a loop it's 4 boxes that you cant take
 MSmits: so thats why its sometimes better to just take them all
 MSmits: especially when there are many loops
 jrke: what does solver will give you move to play or just value?
 jrke: or both
 MSmits: for now just the value, but when i put it in my bot, i should adapt it to also give me the move that goes with the best value
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: it's always a messy part of a minimax, it's just the top layer that needs the move
 dbdr: MSmits, do you MCTS in Langton?
 Marchete: Msmits do you have a good for loop definition for bitmaps?
 Marchete: like for uint64_t bitmaps
 Marchete: nvm probably you are logged off :D
 darkhorse64: ctlz + ^ (1ULL&lt;&lt;bit)&#160;?
 Marchete: thx, I'm doing similar
 Marchete: but I was looking for a more packed way
 darkhorse64: I think MSmits does the same (base on his samples)
 darkhorse64: *based*
 Marchete: for (int i = bE1.startLoop(); i &gt;=0; i = bE1.Next(i) )
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c0e39c79-1191-4a04-96b3-57f0d56a297b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c0e39c79-1191-4a04-96b3-57f0d56a297b</a>
 Marchete: I think I'm doing twice the count_zeroes_righy on Next()
 Marchete: and I'm not sure about those +1 either
 darkhorse64: Looks odd to me. I do this
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5be7c6a1-830d-4e22-b0a2-4e1a53a00fc1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5be7c6a1-830d-4e22-b0a2-4e1a53a00fc1</a>
 Marchete: I'm trying to add all logic in the first line, to be similar to a for loop of a vector&lt;int&gt;
 Marchete: I'm sure that leaving stuff on the end I'll forget about it
 darkhorse64: I am not against abstractions provided they cost nothing
 Marchete: I'll take that as a yes
 jacek: like fizzbuzzEnterprise abstractions?
 T1Anias: hey i completed the weekly challenge but didnt get the reward , is it because it had already ended that week?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, you timeout in Langton
 DomiKo: dbdr are you using MCTS?
 dbdr: where?
 DomiKo: Langton
 dbdr: no, depth 2 minimax
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not supposed to do that dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: only on Bandas
 eulerscheZahl: and ocean of code
 dbdr: you still are
 eulerscheZahl: IDE or arena?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/485692721">https://www.codingame.com/replay/485692721</a>
 dbdr: arena
 dbdr: look at your last battles
 eulerscheZahl: that's an early one..
 eulerscheZahl: oh, lots of timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: that's why val destroyed me
 eulerscheZahl: CS1069: The type name 'Bitmap' could not be found in the namespace 'System.Drawing'. This type has been forwarded to assembly 'System.Drawing.Common, Version=4.0.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' Consider adding a reference to that assembly.
 eulerscheZahl: my debug drawings don't work with .net core&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: fixed. thanks for reporting dbdr
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: what algo do you use eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: i think minimax, let me check
 eulerscheZahl: minimax with iterative deepening
 dbdr: do you ever get deep?
 Illedan: Redstrike is using MinMax too
 eulerscheZahl: did he say that?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Unless he changed after I talked to him last time
 Marchete: with Java?
 Marchete: this is madness!!
 dbdr: java can be very close to C speed, especially if you don't allocate
 Illedan: :O
 dbdr: is this any surprise? :D
 dbdr: damn, it got harder to beat euler :D
 eulerscheZahl: back to #8 where i was before fixing my crashing bot :D
 dbdr: nah, you are #7, where you were before I pulled you down
 eulerscheZahl: not much difference between crashing and non-crashing bot
 eulerscheZahl: was a bit higher before, it's not only you who pulled me down
 dbdr: well, you would have drifted to 90 eventually
 dbdr: it just took time because of little activity and low variance
 eulerscheZahl: down to 8 again :D
 dbdr: maybe send back the crashing one?&#160;;)
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: nah, i'll send some food into me first
 itzblinkzy: i am #1
 itzblinkzy: #6969
 itzblinkzy: say hi
 dbdr: activity is back on Langton&#160;:)
 DomiKo: yes yes
 dbdr: looks like Illedan broke something
 Illedan: shh
 Krakus42: hi
 jacek: ohai
 TanishqMehrotra: how're my bitches
 dbdr: TanishqMehrotra, no tone like that here
 jacek: how're my female dogs?
 dbdr: shut up jacek :D
 dbdr: Illedan, look at this 1st half&#160;:)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/485740988">https://www.codingame.com/replay/485740988</a>
 eulerscheZahl: collecting blue cells
 Illedan: My MinMax is only trying to use the first 9 empty cells in the path of the ant xD
 eulerscheZahl: i have some pruning too. i guess we all have
 Illedan: I guess my pruning is very bad
 TanishqMehrotra: sorry mate i was just kidding
 Brozgar: Hello fellow coders!
 Brozgar: Is there a setting to set World chat as default?
 Brozgar: It puts me to region based one which I'm not interested in&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no, there's not&#160;:(
 Brozgar: Okay, not a big deal&#160;:)
 jacek: huh?i have world all the time
 eulerscheZahl: always shows the channel your joined last. but you can't leave and rejoin world
 Brozgar: Is it your only chat, Jacek? Perhaps it's because my region is an English speaking one.
 Brozgar: Well, anyway, not a big deal&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you could change your country in the profile settings :D
 Brozgar: Just checking out the platform. The AI competition looks really cool, but I have 0 knowledge of the languages it supports. Are there competitions (with live results or something) in JS/TS?
 Brozgar: Oh, should do that, thanks!&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the next contest will take place mid november
 jacek: js is supported
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>most of these are old contests
 eulerscheZahl: except for those "by XYZ"
 jacek: so is ts
 Brozgar: Awesome!
 Krakus42: hello guys i beat boss 3 but i still can't promote to bronze for some reason does anyone know why? 
 darkhorse64: You only promote if you are above the boss when all battles have been playe
 darkhorse64: *playe*
 darkhorse64: d
 darkhorse64: See, promoted right after end of submit
 darkhorse64: gg
 Ifthel: How do I tell CodinGame that I don't want my Java code slathered with the "final" keyword?
 Ifthel: Actually, how do I tell CodinGame to stop giving me suggestions altogether?
 cheeze2000: :flag_pt:
 Laminator: Last time I checked, someone had made a chrome extension where you could inject some javascript or something. It didn't work for me. But if you find, out, please let us all know
 Schwase: first contribution officially published as ready

 TheSpiffiest: What's the puzzle that's almost Coders Strike Back, but simpler?
 DaNinja: Search Race
 TheSpiffiest: ah that was it Thanks. I got to gold in CSB, but I need to work out some simple stuff to get higher I think

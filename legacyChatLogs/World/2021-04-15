 TiniMounier: Hi guys, on the batman exercice on java i try to recognize the bombDir with  "if (bombDir == "UR") {System.err.println("test");}" but it never works do you know why&#160;?
 Mr.Pepper: bombdir&#160;!= UR :p
 TiniMounier: what&#160;? when i print bombDir i got UR 
 Mr.Pepper: oh
 TiniMounier: well for the second test 
 TiniMounier: for the first test i got  DR but it didn't work either
 TiniMounier: i tried adding spaces before and after UR but still the same result

 derjack: good noon
 MSmits: hey derjack
 MSmits: I made your ntuple thingy work, understand all the code now. Cool stuff
 derjack: oO
 MSmits: it's not that far from a nn
 derjack: its more like perceptron really
 MSmits: i think i can convert it easily to doing what the xor thing does
 MSmits: the xor nn
 MSmits: i wonder if it needs less weights than the ntuple
 MSmits: or more
 MSmits: I am guessing it needs more, because the ntuple structure makes use of the game rules
 MSmits: this information needs to be baked into the network somehow, which may make it use more weights
 derjack: ttt is quite hard for simple mlp network
 MSmits: why is that?
 derjack: in comparison to ntuple. dunno, it requires more hidden units and/or layer than i anticipated
 MSmits: well, you want it to predict the game result for every possible board layout. You're expecting perfect play
 MSmits: when you're doing it for oware you dont expect perfect play
 MSmits: so the bar is higher for simpler games
 derjack: could be
 MSmits: did you mess around with function approximation? I had a thought earlier that you could easily define some complicated math function, generate a bunch of random x and make a network to predict it. That also seems like a fun learning exercise
 MSmits: it's very close to the xor
 derjack: i didnt
 MSmits: ah ok, i do a lot of trendline fitting in excel at work for when students to physics experiments. I think I could do the same thing with a NN
 MSmits: you can either fit the whole function with hundreds of weights, or pick a few parameters, say for a linear function
 MSmits: the magic is really in the backpropagation, you can use that for anything
 derjack: hmm but how to approximate function. nn output is sigmoid or tanh
 derjack: or something else?
 MSmits: hmm can you use the bias?
 MSmits: it's a good question
 MSmits: relu wont work 
 derjack: relu only for hidden
 MSmits: is that always the case?
 MSmits: do people use relu only for hidden layers?
 derjack: dunno. but i dont see much sense using relu for output
 Louis.: hi
 Louis.: derjack
 MSmits: well the idea is to use relu to prevent multiplication making stuff go to zero, so i guess having 1 layer use sigmoid and the rest relu seems fine
 derjack: hello Louis.
 Louis.: whatsup
 MSmits: the positive vertical direction
 derjack: hmm you can use linear (no activation at all) in the output
 MSmits: you mean linear in the output and something else in a hidden layer?
 MSmits: relu seems more suited for discrete functions
 derjack: yes
 MSmits: sounds good
 derjack: you played with the nn playground. there is that spiral example
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: does it have a linear combination at the end? I dont remember
 derjack: you can use many hidden layers. or less hidden layers and use x^2 and y^2 as input
 derjack: i see n-tuple as adding more inputs
 MSmits: yeah thats what my students experiment with
 MSmits: right, if you structure the input, you do some of the "thinking" for the nn, so its job becomes easier
 derjack: exactly
 MSmits: thats why i dont believe its a good idea to just have a completely fixed framework where you just "plug in" a game
 MSmits: you need to do some thinking, make it easier. You will need a smaller network. Better use of resources
 MSmits: i guess if you have unlimited resources like those azero people, it doesnt matter much, but here on CG it does, I think
 derjack: well their goal is to make 'general' ai
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: what I am saying is that should not be the goal when you're playing around on CG&#160;:)
 MSmits: though some games are similar, so you can reuse much i guess

 MSmits: sorry, i mean his pony barn, obviously
 derjack: stop horsing around
 AntiSquid: now you jumped the horse
 derjack: fix your chess bot
 BigFatDecker: ok so how do i do minmax in connect 4 challenge im lost
 struct: do you already know minmax?
 MSmits: you could count the number of ways you can complete 4 in a row with the current setup. As an evaluation function
 MSmits: say you have 2 in a row somewhere. If it is still possible to add 2 more to get 4, then that's 1 
 MSmits: anyways, that's just an idea, i use mcts myself
 derjack: you mean puzzle or game
 MSmits: there's plenty of gith bots for C4 i bet
 MSmits: look for an eval there

 AntiSquid: might be it&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Me too. Adblockers / scriptblockers/ antitracker and the site works
 BlaiseEbuth: Just had to allow scripts

 eulerscheZahl: i use "AdBlock"
 Smelty: o . o
 eulerscheZahl: for no particular reason, was the first adblocker showing up when i needed one
 AntiSquid: i have both ublock and ghostery
 AntiSquid: and noscript extension too to disable the "please white list us, please disable your adblock" bs
 eulerscheZahl: i just close those pages which complain about the adblocker
 eulerscheZahl: if they don't want to give their content for free, their loss
 Smelty: lol
 Andriamanitra: gotta be careful with adblocks, half of them sell "approved ads" to companies
 eulerscheZahl: like adblock plus did
 jacek: i wouldnt mind non invasive square ads
 Smelty: which is why you have MULTIPLE
 Smelty: adblock
 eulerscheZahl: the use of an adblocker is pure self-defense against horrible ads
 Smelty: ^^
 Andriamanitra: ublock origin is one i know is legit for sure, i also use privacybadger which is made by EFF but it's mostly redundant

 USB3R: would be cool if they changed that!
 AntiSquid: there is no such thing as acceptable ads @_@
 AntiSquid: either i look for a product or i don't
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't mind ignoring some offer that doesn't annoy me

 eulerscheZahl: not like i would buy it. but if anyone is willing to pay someone else for showing it to me (or hiding it from me)
 eulerscheZahl: then i'm fine
 AntiSquid: do you use anything to cover your browser fingerprint euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, the test shows that it's easy to identify me

 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: stressing to look it go slowly
 Illedan: and not working always
 yukihanata: which one is the easyest
 Illedan: stopping, changing some params. Try again
 Astrobytes: Param tuning is life tho
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: not
 Illedan: I need to automate this
 Illedan: fast
 struct: no patience for it
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: GA
 Astrobytes: afaik that's a valid approach
 struct: GA to optimize params
 Illedan: I'll have a NN to tune my NN to tune my NN which leads my GA into tuning my RL. YEAH, lets go!
 Astrobytes: Param hell
 jacek: hyperparam?
 Illedan: ye
 struct: Which game?
 Illedan: No CG game yet, but I just created a new project for Oware

 AntiSquid: there is export weights command for any given library (TF, keras etc)
 AntiSquid: or a way to display them 
 AntiSquid: you can code a forward prop in c++ @_@
 jacek: forward is so easy
 Marchete: I put a python code AntiSquid
 Marchete: to export weights
 Illedan: Yeah, but it didn't work in my setup :P
 Marchete: and view them on jupyter notebook
 Marchete: why?
 Illedan: I didn't have a model..
 jacek: oO

 AntiSquid: sorry was busy, had to prepare food for my long shifts, don't want to buy stuff

 MOScody: how so?
 struct: for example
 struct: if(true)	cout &lt;&lt; "x y boost" &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: Both instruction would be sent to the referee
 struct: THis is an usual mistakes that new players make
 MOScody: yea I didn't write my code like that.

 struct: I cant test the code though, the league im currently in has different inputs
 MOScody: it works!
 MOScody: thanks!
 struct: np
 yukihanata: hi
 Zenoscave: hey struct
 Smelty: o . o
 EliTheCoder: i haven't gotten a reverse mode in so long

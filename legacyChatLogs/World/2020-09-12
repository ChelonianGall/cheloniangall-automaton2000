 trainman: hello everyone  
 trainman: I am new in Codingame I hope everyone will help each other
 eulerscheZahl: did the Autumn challenge bring you here?
 sugam: how to go to the contest&#160;? 
 sugam: i don't see it in the contests tab
 Hjax: @sugam the autumn ai challenge will be on an existing game 
 Hjax: you have to wait for the announcement to know which game it is 
 sugam: after the anouncement
 sugam: just go and play
 sugam: it?
 Hjax: after the announcement youll be able to find it in this list <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Hjax: its already there, we just dont know which one it is yet :D 
 sugam: hmm mm
 Hjax: we do know its going to be a relatively unpopular game, and one thats beginner friendly 
 Hjax: so probably not one of the newer games, not CSB, and not one of the board games 
 eulerscheZahl: and not one with a top bot available on github
 eulerscheZahl: so it must be vindinium :D
 Hjax: code a la mode seems likely 
 Hjax: also euler arent you german? why are you awake
 eulerscheZahl: because it's already close to 7am
 eulerscheZahl: what a question :P
 Hjax: ah early riser? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Hjax: i see 
 Hjax: its 1 am here, im about to sleep
 eulerscheZahl: i have a cat who's even earlier than me
 eulerscheZahl: "it's 4:30, i'm hungry"
 Hjax: lol
 eulerscheZahl: me: "no, i'll show you the door"
 sugam: how to be good at bot programming 
 Hjax: practice! 
 eulerscheZahl: around 6am she usually wins
 eulerscheZahl: read post mortems to get ideas
 Hjax: since this game is one thats been played before, be sure to check out the posts on the forums 
 Hjax: yeah, what euler said 
 x544D: is there a private Command u type in chat to send a private msg using the name&#160;: Exmpl /msg name MessageText
 x544D:&#160;?
 MadKnight: isn't that the one&#160;?
 sugam: i guess the text just appears red whenever it finds your username?
 MadKnight: yea
 sugam: MadKnight is a pro
 sugam: did it appear red?
 MadKnight: yep
 MadKnight: good job sugam
 x544D: testing on you @sugam
 x544D: sorry bud :p
 sugam: x544DTestingIfITGoesRedEvenWithOutTheSpaceBetweenYourNickname

 sugam: did it appear red
 x544D: nop
 eulerscheZahl: it does in some cases sugam
 eulerscheZahl: when someone links to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a> i get pinged
 eulerscheZahl: but letters break the ping
 dbdr: _Royale struck back again
 eulerscheZahl: an up and down
 dbdr: +1K is a lot
 eulerscheZahl: +300
 eulerscheZahl: he had a bigger leadership before and then dropped below me again
 dbdr: i mean he's +1k compared to the previous day
 eulerscheZahl: ok, 350..
 eulerscheZahl: oh, he's going up and down a lot
 eulerscheZahl: now i have 2 users DMing me about their problems :scream:
 dbdr: yeah, happens to me too
 dbdr: I think general chat is better for that
 sugam: you guys made codinggame?
 dbdr: no
 dbdr: we're players like you
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the CG logo behind the nick is misleading
 AnyaA: i need help
 Marchete: moin
 Uljahn: meowrning
 sugam: long time no seeUljahn
 uvBoss: unofficial contest has started guys
 dbdr: what's the multi?
 uvBoss: kutulu
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/code-of-kutulu">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/code-of-kutulu</a>
 Marchete: PCR :D
 Marchete: kutulu, I'll better hurry up!
 dbdr: Marchete: the top 3 in PCR looks like a tossup now
 eulerscheZahl: after the github discussion and the possibility of cheating they choose kutulu? :rofl:
 AnyaA: wow
 dbdr: public top bot?
 Marchete: and the problem with ktulu is that bots are cooperative
 Marchete: GoD is the oppositve
 Marchete: opposite
 Marchete: what I wrote?
 dbdr: :D
 Marchete: oppositive
 Marchete: :D
 eulerscheZahl: yes dbdr, a bit is leaked. just check for anid at the top and you will know
 Marchete: I'll keep doing my Dots and Boxes stuff, I'm just trying stuff at my own pace (hint: terribly slow)
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: I looked at the diff of multi leabderboards and I only see royale going slightly down in a few places. something does not add up
 Marchete: euler, it's a trap
 Marchete: in reality dbdr is tricking you, he is the real threat
 Marchete: slowly going 1st
 eulerscheZahl: i won't do the math to compute the points myself
 dbdr: tricking how?
 eulerscheZahl: distracting
 Marchete: yeah
 AnyaA: Kutulu has I high chance that you can cheat, so if you want to improve, play something else
 dbdr: no need to do math, if you rank goes down your points don't go up
 dbdr: conspiracy!&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: did royale submit recently?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe at night during the leaderboard update?
 dbdr: I don't see it
 dbdr: all the tools run after the update for that reason
 dbdr: Marchete: did you notice?&#160;;)
 Marchete: noticed what?
 dbdr: our ranks
 Marchete: yeah, congrats for the 4th place :D
 dbdr: thx. you might very well get it tomorrow
 dbdr: random noise
 dbdr: *back
 Marchete: except multi bots you have much better ranks on all other categories
 dbdr: yes, and multis count the most, so it balances&#160;:)
 Marchete: temp codegolf broke for me with that sort change...
 Marchete: and they changed thor too
 dbdr: ah, you didn't do anything about it yet?
 dbdr: temp was a year ago I think&#160;:)
 dbdr: thor a couple of months
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: An*d in Kutulu?
 eulerscheZahl: what's about him?
 dbdr: you told me to look at the leaderboard
 dbdr: C&amp;P bots
 eulerscheZahl: lol, all crashing now :D
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they didn't like the language update
 dbdr: in arena?
 dbdr: they didn't reach the bottom yet, that's me&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no one submitting recently
 dbdr: so it might be IDE only?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444039016">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444039016</a>they have a nice harmony here (except for blaster ruining it)
 dbdr: I guess I might as well resub and see&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486588736">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486588736</a>and now they crash (except for dedoo who uses C# too)
 dbdr: here we go!
 dbdr: but I might bot even play against them
 eulerscheZahl: you are destaibilizing my #2 :rage:
 dbdr: wth
 Marchete: I hate when people disturb the deads...
 dbdr: also, no 10 ranking matches. I guess legend is too small
 eulerscheZahl: red arrow already
 Marchete: I mean, dead multis where I have a good place, please leave them alone!
 dbdr: oh yes, you're #2 and #3
 dbdr: but you won the match Marchete, might even get #2&#160;;)
 sugam: i can't copy the code from ide useing ctrl + c
 Marchete: we were in balance
 Marchete: I was OK with 2,3,4 of euler, me and Ille
 Marchete: no need to disturb that...
 eulerscheZahl: sugam <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fighting-the-editor/186234/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fighting-the-editor/186234/</a>
 Marchete: also, I need to say I had anti-bots measures
 Marchete: I abused them
 dbdr: bots?
 Marchete: copied bots
 dbdr: ah
 eulerscheZahl: i did that for game of drones
 eulerscheZahl: ignore those who always do the same thing. you don't have to defend against them
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr still pretty low. what rank can we expect?
 dbdr: from me? I was #46/47 before
 dbdr: so nothing to lose&#160;:)
 dbdr: but this legend is very flat
 dbdr: last has 15, first has 26
 dbdr: because of the weirdness of the game I think
 dbdr: strong meta
 dbdr: oh, only 1024 players in Kutulu
 jrke: oh code of kutulu
 jrke: dbdr are u in contest
 dbdr: probably not
 AnyaA: i am
 jrke: in every unofficial contest i forgot the rules of game
 eulerscheZahl: 1026 already
 jrke: last i forgot rules of PR2 then i started from beginning 
 eulerscheZahl: the beginning is always a good place to start
 eulerscheZahl: ceg would try to guess the rules
 dbdr: machine learn the rules
 dbdr: write a single bot, train it on all multis
 dbdr: MSmits: you should also resub in Kutulu
 eulerscheZahl: broken bot?
 jrke: i think he would be busy in painting with :poop:
 BenjaminUrquhart: to appear on leaderboard I assume
 dbdr: no, bring the cheaters down
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 BenjaminUrquhart: last time I submitted in this was 10 months ago
 dbdr: hitting the submit button does not need a lot of time, can fit between two layers of paint&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 24 months here
 kovi: same
 eulerscheZahl: hi kovii was hoping for you to login so i could ask you if you know anything about RAIC prize shippingbut now that you are there, they've sent an email
 kovi: and it was my worst comp, 600 lines, and mostly heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: so just: hi&#160;:)
 kovi: hello euler!&#160;:)
 x544D: eh&#160;! am i gonna keep getting these robots captcha check earch time queuing CLASH&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: if you keep playing that many clashes: yes
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/474482054">https://www.codingame.com/replay/474482054</a>these are not perfect clones. there are multiple sets of clones?
 eulerscheZahl: game of drones has some clones
 eulerscheZahl: there is LouJo, contest winner
 eulerscheZahl: and Volonia or however you spell that, 12th in the contest i think
 eulerscheZahl: the first but is Python, the 2nd is Java
 eulerscheZahl: and there is god, 2nd in the contest. that bot uses the player ID as a random seed and thus does fairly well against itself
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't survive one of the language updates, crashing now
 eulerscheZahl: but they are great testing opponents for offline
 dbdr: two c++, one python 2 and one python 3 in that match
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 dbdr: maybe 2 pairs of clones
 eulerscheZahl: python2+3 could still be the same bot
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: but i didn't know about another C++ bot being public
 eulerscheZahl: or maybe 2 users writing it together?
 eulerscheZahl: whatever
 dbdr: god is C++
 vortexdom: kati bolya hau ssh
 eulerscheZahl: but plays differently based on player ID
 eulerscheZahl: as i said
 dbdr: right
 jrke: top 3 have pasted there code in blog of game of drones i think
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: that's loujo (python) and god (broken)
 eulerscheZahl: and at some point the links to the code stopped working
 eulerscheZahl: and that guy from Nepal want's to ssh into the chat server?
 vortexdom: ah ah 
 vortexdom: timaru ni nepali ho
 vortexdom: chup chap gara yar
 vortexdom: jhyau vaisako ya afuly
 eulerscheZahl: please speak English
 eulerscheZahl: or switch channels
 vortexdom: kati na nabujne jasto kya
 vortexdom: oh sorry
 vortexdom: haha
 vortexdom: i thought u from nepal
 sugam: vortexdom they are not from nepal
 vortexdom: lol
 vortexdom: k nepali jasto
 vortexdom: patar patar garya ta
 vortexdom: k k bolxan k k 
 vortexdom: agi dekhi herxu yar
 eulerscheZahl: go to #np please
 rivancic: Hi guys! One question. Lets say I want to review or train the task that was in Clash Of Code. Is there any way you can retake the same task? Just for training and experimenting?

 x544D: the even started right&#160;?
 vortexdom: mine everyday
 x544D: event*
 rivancic: @eulerscheZahl you are a legend :stars:
 eulerscheZahl: nah, just good at wasting my time
 ronanborja: hello everyone
 x544D: o/
 x544D: Guys , when [CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2020] Starts exactly&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: november 12th
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 61 days 7h 46min
 x544D: lol I was thinking today it opens 
 x544D: oh boi well , Thanks. 
 rivancic: nah you see you did not waste your time, I can now use your solution
 eulerscheZahl: today is the Autumn challenge, an unofficial "contest"
 eulerscheZahl: featuring an existing game: code of kutulu
 rivancic: do you have direct access to CodinGame DB?
 Moctrof: Hey I was wondering how do you hash two coordinates x,y&#160;? For the moment I use a string x+" "+y, what might be the problem with that&#160;?
 x544D: any links @euler&#160;? i'm kind of new .
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm just a normal user.i'm not staff
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/autumn-ai-2020/186331">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/autumn-ai-2020/186331</a> x544D
 Ryanless: the problem is that x,y and y,x give the same hash
 x544D: thanks .
 eulerscheZahl: the string concatenation is a simple way to get different hashes. maybe a little slow if you need it a lot
 eulerscheZahl: in what range are x and y?
 Moctrof: 0,5 -&gt; x
 Moctrof: 0,12-&gt;y
 Moctrof: 0,11*
 eulerscheZahl: then how about something like100*x + y
 eulerscheZahl: that's a unique hashing for the given ranges and faster than strings
 Moctrof: Nice&#160;!
 Moctrof: Thanks
 Ryanless: how many total /active members does codingame have?
 eulerscheZahl: total: over 1 million
 eulerscheZahl: active: hard to tell i thinkthere were 5000 players in the last cotnest
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Ryanless: ok, interesstig... was curious because of the ranking system . I assume a lot of people rarely join ranked content
 dbdr: total: over 2 million actually&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so that's over 1 million as well :P
 eulerscheZahl: how time flies. i remember hitting the 1M mark
 Marchete: I still remember how GA was so cool at these times...
 Moctrof: What is cooler now&#160;?
 Moctrof: AutomatonNN Are you cooler than GA&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: good
 Marchete: MCTS, NN or both
 jacek: mcts is so last week
 eulerscheZahl: we use GAimax now
 dbdr: UCTS
 MadKnight: sounds promising
 MadKnight: UCT's&#160;?
 dbdr: tree search using UCT formula for exploration, and evaluation, no rollout
 jacek: mcts w/ EPT 0 depth
 dbdr: but then it has no monte carlo in it
 jacek: i multiply eval part in UCT by random [0.9, 1.1]
 dbdr: why?
 dbdr: to justify the name?&#160;;)
 jacek: so it has some randomness
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: though the name monte carlo is about sampling
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: time limit introduces some randomness too, though less
 jacek: and its not enough for oware. smits says my bot is deterministic at least 70+ plies
 sugam: i like how jacek's bot behaves
 jacek: hm?
 sugam: your bot.
 eulerscheZahl: which game?
 sugam: i watched the replay
 jacek: it just stays in the same cell and escapes immediate danger
 sugam: yes
 jacek: and its effective in wood 2 as well
 sugam: so once we're promoted, we won't get demoted?
 jacek: yes
 sugam: ohh so we can make custom strategy to pass certain leagues
 jacek: in new league there could be more rules
 sugam: that's clever 
 jrke: more rules + stronger bots = promoted league
 Bartolini188: what is the best IDE for Python on Mac OS?
 JasperV: the codingame fall challenge is listed as a community event, not a multi puzzle? what can I expect of this or is it unknown?
 eulerscheZahl: " is listed as a community event"where?
 eulerscheZahl: it will be an official contest like the spring challenge
 eulerscheZahl: oh, found the "community event"
 JasperV: ok good. yeah last time it always said explicitly multi player puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: but at (6) it says
 JasperV: ok thanks
 JasperV: @Bartolini188 pycharm is used a lot
 AntiSquid: pycharm costs moneyz
 Astrobytes: Oh, the "contest" is Kutulu. Guess I'm aiming for legend then, been putting it off for a long time
 Astrobytes: What's your Kutulu legend rank AntiSquid?
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for the correct use of quotes Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: jupyter notebook is used a lot and it's free 
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: squid is aiming for bottom legend
 Astrobytes: lol 8th
 danlars: @AntiSquid There is a community edition
 Astrobytes: no sleep til #1
 eulerscheZahl: but morozec's bot didn't survive the language update
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486630435">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486630435</a> 
 Astrobytes: That was the github one?
 eulerscheZahl: not in public..
 Astrobytes: ah
 AntiSquid: no idea how to benchmark for improvements in this game if it favors similar plays
 jacek: does following other player is viable strategy?
 eulerscheZahl: being close to others is really important
 TheSilent_Boy: Hi
 AntiSquid: not sure why i remember game having 3 monster types
 eulerscheZahl: the 3rd is you?
 AntiSquid: getting occasional timeout (didn't read all inputs) is that CG issue or new C# version related?
 eulerscheZahl: regarding your kutulu bot?
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: most games work
 eulerscheZahl: the language update broke it, Mono -&gt; .net core
 eulerscheZahl: hm, just tested the morozec bot
 eulerscheZahl: seems complicated to fix
 eulerscheZahl: i see an import of a now removed library
 eulerscheZahl: but it's used all over the place
 AntiSquid: really? i only rarely get an error
 AntiSquid: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 eulerscheZahl: hm, maybe your bot got more lucky than morozec then
 AntiSquid: but it's like one in 5 games max
 eulerscheZahl: my bot seems to be working fine
 AntiSquid: i don't know if i changed anything since then 
 AntiSquid: diffcheck @_@
 eulerscheZahl: so the problem is on your side i think
 AntiSquid: YOLO resub or not? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how do you work in the same league
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486634369">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486634369</a> :P
 AntiSquid: lots of c# bots at the top
 eulerscheZahl: let's say instances
 AntiSquid: old versions
 eulerscheZahl: didn't know that MSmits is also crashing
 Astrobytes: was before he switched to C++
 AntiSquid: rewriting 2.6k lines to C++, is that good use of time?
 Astrobytes: No, I mean in before he switched to using C++ in general
 AntiSquid: no idea, maybe he was just checking the game
 eulerscheZahl: you failed to select D as your language
 AntiSquid: so rewrite to D instead? lol
 eulerscheZahl: it's faster
 eulerscheZahl: also for writing i think
 AntiSquid: why couldn't it be one of the unpopular multis?&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: is that blaster's best version now?
 eulerscheZahl: i think he never submitted his improved version
 eulerscheZahl: said he will if we get close to his current
 AntiSquid: aren't you close enough?
 AntiSquid: illedan didn't update either
 TobiasA: pls when i try to run a hello world code in c++  sublime text it says character constant too long for its type
 AntiSquid: ya ok i am still bugged ... got to rewrite or something, give me motivation Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i learned a lot about that
 TobiasA: i dont know whatto do
 hellotheregeneralkenobi: :poop:
 AntiSquid: :poop: to you too
 TheSilent_Boy: :angry:
 AntiSquid: Marchet e has timeouts with c++, is it really just c# library issue?
 eulerscheZahl: other languages got upgrades too
 eulerscheZahl: oh, someone pushed me on top
 eulerscheZahl: aka you
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: get the blaster light-cannon up into the sky to call him
 TheSilent_Boy: a
 AntiSquid: euler you have timeouts too it seems: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486638587">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/486638587</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, indeed
 eulerscheZahl: even a non-reproducable one&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: some are CG related imo
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you are right. problems with the timer
 eulerscheZahl: i remember using 45ms on a 50ms game usually
 eulerscheZahl: now even with 40ms i struggle sometimes
 Adlan_Fauzi: .

 ChandraKanthPasunuru: hi guys
 Hjax: hi there
 Astrobytes: What do you think of the "contest" choice Hjax?
 TheSilent_Boy: mhjjhghghjg
 Astrobytes: Please don't do that TheSilent_Boy
 TheSilent_Boy: :grin:
 TheSilent_Boy: sorry
 TheSilent_Boy: was just relaxing
 AntiSquid: spamming all day @_@ 
 AntiSquid: TheSilent_Boy, Automaton2000 will make a visit to your home to ask a few questions about your spam
 Automaton2000: been at it for the first time i saw it somewhere
 uvBoss: xD
 Hjax: @Astrobytes its not one ive tried before
 Hjax: and its a grid based game 
 Hjax: so i think im happy 
 Astrobytes: Heuristics will get you far
 Hjax: i was worried it would be mad max
 Astrobytes: And it's a fun game
 Hjax: is there fog of war in the higher leagues?
 Astrobytes: nope
 Hjax: so its pretty searchable then
 Hjax: branching factor isnt huge if im only searching my own movements 
 Astrobytes: reasonably, there's some tricky aspects iirc
 Astrobytes: Mines was just heuristics
 Hjax: im just parsing the inputs right now 
 Astrobytes: Using Rust?
 Hjax: starting with java, will probably port to rust later if i want more performance 
 Astrobytes: Cool
 Hjax: easier to not fight a new language when im still trying to understand the game 
 Astrobytes: Very true
 Hjax: the game certainly looks interesting though 
 Hjax: its like, half cooperative 
 Hjax: but you still want your "teammates" to die 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, indeed. It's like a backstabb-y kind of thing. It's a cool game
 Hjax: also its lovecraft themed 
 Hjax: which is always a plus 
 Astrobytes: yeah the theme was awesome too, was quite a fun contest, lots of Cthulhu/Lovecrast jokes and whatnot
 Astrobytes: *Lovecraft
 Astrobytes: iirc I think the referee is a bit messy
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: hi guys
 Astrobytes: You already said hi
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: people who are using pything are so cool, the way they write code is even cooler. they write stuff less then 10 lines and that's it it works.
 Astrobytes: Try learning python then
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 AntiSquid: ChandraKanthPasunuru ah you didn't hear the legends of 10 lines of Ruby then

 Nerchio: wow i managed to advance from wood3 in kthulu
 Nerchio: :o
 Thiesjoo: Noice
 Nerchio: it took longer than i expected :grimacing:
 Thiesjoo: But you got there!
 Nerchio: you also got a bot in this game?
 Thiesjoo: Bronze currently
 Nerchio: ah alright
 Nerchio: participating in the unofficial contest?
 ruiamoah: man the evaluation is hard
 Thiesjoo: Yup
 Nerchio: You can now use the LIGHT to ward off minions and come up with a PLAN to heal yourself and the explorers around you.
 Nerchio: wow what the hell haha :D
 Thiesjoo: Even more complexity&#160;:')
 Nerchio: hmm
 Nerchio: so Planning
 Hjax: i was wondering if youd show up Nerchio
 Hjax: glad to see you!
 Nerchio: doesnt stop you from losing sanity if you are isolated right
 Nerchio: hello Hjax :D
 Nerchio: i dont have much time i think to go far but i will try to get gold
 ruiamoah: have you guys got an evaluation from a company using  codingame
 Nerchio: I did not ruiamoah :p
 Scarfield: hi Nerchio i think Hjax asked for you the other day, good luck with the contest&#160;:)
 Scarfield: oh lol chat scroll xD
 Nerchio: hehe ye :D
 Nerchio: good luck in the contest guys, if you are participating
 Scarfield: in wood you lose 1 sanity in group, 3 when more than 2 tiles apart
 Nerchio: i just advanced to wood1 :D
 blasterpoard: it's easy until high gold
 blasterpoard: people literally igrnoe slashers and yells
 Nerchio: when is the last rule change?
 blasterpoard: yell is the last rule
 Scarfield: wood 1 i believe, bronze is just more maps
 blasterpoard: idk in what league
 Nerchio: oh nice&#160;;)
 Nerchio: i got yell in wood1 already
 Thiesjoo: What's the start than blasterpoard?
 Nerchio: and i think i will advance higher still
 Thiesjoo: *strat
 Thiesjoo: With the same bot i  went from wood 3 to bronze
 Thiesjoo: Was pretty cool to see
 Nerchio: i might do the same we will see :D
 Nerchio: although i lost a few games now so probably not
 blasterpoard: you don't need any strategy
 blasterpoard: just make your bot choose the same path as the others whenever you're at a crossroads
 blasterpoard:&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: That works?
 Nerchio: well you can't predict it haha
 blasterpoard: that's what decides games in legend
 Nerchio: its luck :D
 blasterpoard: no, it's legend bots being copies of each other
 Scarfield: lol really?
 Thiesjoo: Lemme comment out half of my code and see if it works
 Thiesjoo: OMG IT WORKS
 Nerchio: somebody leaked the code or just similar bots? :D
 blasterpoard: there are 5 copies of one bot
 Thiesjoo: Just follow others and it works
 blasterpoard: and some bots that are overly happy to go the same way as those
 Nerchio: yeah that kind of makes sense, maybe too much meta game in legend&#160;;)
 blasterpoard: it's not metagame; it's just a cou;le of russians sharing code
 blasterpoard: and then one of them even put it on github
 Nerchio:&#160;;(

 blasterpoard: frame 55-&gt;56
 Nerchio: ah so you being 1 is abusing the russian leaked code? :D
 Nerchio: except ofcourse good bot
 blasterpoard: no, this is my contest code
 Nerchio: yea thats what i am asking if you are meta gaming the leaked code
 blasterpoard: no
 Nerchio: not if you are using it :P
 Nerchio: ok then if you can beat all of that then maybe the leak is not such a big problem
 blasterpoard: no, because if they follow each other, games like what I posted happen
 Nerchio: yeah i see
 Nerchio: well i didnt play enough to really understand whats goig on
 blasterpoard: they even all yell at turn 10 and write the same thing
 Nerchio: Thiesjoo im in bronze :D 
 Thiesjoo: Nice!!!
 Thiesjoo: To silver w ego
 Thiesjoo: *we go
 Nerchio: noo :D
 blasterpoard: avoidance of slashers gets you to gold almost instantly
 Thiesjoo: All the battles i lose is because of slashers
 blasterpoard: and don't bother with deep searches, current rank 6 is my bot with search depth limited to 1
 Thiesjoo: Do you do anything with shelters?
 blasterpoard: shelters are a part of my simulations
 blasterpoard: and sanity is a part of eval
 blasterpoard: so, yes
 blasterpoard: but I don't intentionally walk towards them from afar
 Thiesjoo: Just if they are close, walk to them
 Thiesjoo: Something like that
 blasterpoard: not really
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: The last contest was pac man, correct? I want to make sure I didn't skip anothero ne
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: another one*
 Zenoscave: Was ocean of code before or after PAC?
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 Scarfield: before, yea pac man was the latest
 Zenoscave: That's what I thought!
 Scarfield: before, and yea pac man was the latest
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ok
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: gusy how i can get better.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Practice&#160;:)
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: what i have to practice.
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: first i want to slove thigs faster. wher i can start?
 Hjax: it doesnt really matter
 Hjax: just play anything that looks fun 
 kimovitch: Just discovered this platform
 kimovitch: Why didn't I know about this before
 AntiSquid: to quote men in black 4 (which was a crappy movie btw)&#160;:  “Always remember: the universe has a way of leading you to where you're supposed to be, at the moment you're supposed to be there.” kimovitch
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: *Dies*
 AntiSquid: just keep an ID with that avatar on you when you do that so the body can be identified
 kimovitch: Cool stuff, I'm supposed to prepare for an interview but I'm having too much fun
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Maybe you should have fun preparing for the interview :D
 kimovitch: That's what I keep saying, but the race in coders strike back ain't gonna be won by itself
 AntiSquid: the do some puzzles&#160;?
 AntiSquid: doubt they care about coders strike back, they just care about your ability to solve easy puzzles and clash of code . CSB is too posh for them
 kimovitch: Thanks for the advice, still discovering the platform, don't even know where the simple puzzles are. I'll definitely check it out!
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 kimovitch: :ok_hand:
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: puzzles are basic stuff right. after playing like 5 hurs clas of code. i am getting better.
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: i am understand about language i am using more and write code for the first time right with out any logic error. iam so happy aboutthat.
 BenjaminUrquhart: depends on the puzzle
 ErebosTheos: how to avoid??
 shad0wcrawl3r: you just run
 Simonka: just dont 
 shad0wcrawl3r: if the enemy is targeting you just make ur characer run away frm it
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Hello apple
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;:)
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Can I just copypaste my code from don't panic 1 to 2?
 Allis: Try it and see?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: x.x
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Too lazy

 AntiSquid: dear clash of code players: majority here don't like that mode, sorry to burst your bubble
 derjack: yea, we prefer escape
 MSmits: nine men's morris sim is hard
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: reminds me of oware
 jacek: i thought youd have 8bits state by now
 MSmits: not 8 bits lol
 MSmits: I use uint32_t[2];
 MSmits: it's just the rules with the mills and the game phases that are a lot of work
 MSmits: even just printing the board is difficult

 MSmits: I like it. Now to make a bot that plays a random move without crashing&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: next you'll become an ascii artist
 MSmits: a noble profession
 Butanium: lol

 derjack: ah, different game, the same name
 Butanium: Yes the author of the other clash of bots didn't want to change the name because he already had a paper about this porject for school
 Butanium: but since I was the first with this name idea I just added a subtitle to make the diffrence
 derjack: how about crash of bots :v
 MyMonkey: +1
 Butanium: meeh
 Butanium: I prefer clash of bots (っ °Д °;)っ
 derjack: clever SEO
 Butanium: I never thought about it like that, but now that you say it... you're right
 derjack: how about escape bots!
 Butanium: why escape&#160;?
 Butanium: you can't escape

 2foolish: (   (   )
 jacek: oh right, the strike
 jacek: thats why i didnt want to troll much
 jacek: when theyre back, the trolling will return
 AntiSquid: what strike
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 explain
 Automaton2000: oh, now i get your point
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: You're already in quasi permanent strike Squid, don't worry. :smirk:
 AntiSquid: ah that ... not really just doing other stuff
 ArmanTaheri: any c proggrammer?
 AntiSquid: there must be some out there, the world is a huge place
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: The #world is a huge place.
 ArmanTaheri: i'm talikng about this caht
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: \o/
 AntiSquid: why you hiring? how many years of experience do you need?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: ArmanTaheri, if your question is "any c programmer here?", then the answer is "yes". But if it's "is any c programmer here 'cause I've a problem but I want to be sure before exposing it" then read <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">https://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 AntiSquid: just say yes and say how much you want per hour lol
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: What a mod... :smirk:
 AntiSquid: with entrepreneur skills obv
 AntiSquid: just set you up for bizz
 Butanium: what's the strike&#160;?
 Butanium: strike of bots&#160;?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: "Grève" dear compatriot.
 AntiSquid: "a refusal to work organized by a body of employees as a form of protest, typically in an attempt to gain a concession or concessions from their employer." i think they mean this
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: ^
 AntiSquid: was never on strike and afaik you'd need to officially declare it first 
 Butanium: （￣︶￣）↗　
 Butanium: oh yes didn't know the en word
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: You'd need to be employed too...
 Butanium: What causes the strike&#160;?
 AntiSquid: unpaid volunteer
 AntiSquid: they mean it figuratively Butanium
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: "Contest" format and platform evolution.
 derjack: dental plan
 Butanium: the fact that there were no bot contest&#160;?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Do toads have teeth? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: dental plan&#160;? you managed to confuse me more than i already was
 AntiSquid: clap
 Butanium: BlaiseVonEbuthIII of course how would he eat otherwise&#160;?

 Butanium: noice
 Butanium: MCTS or something else&#160;?
 MSmits: it's just random moves now, to test my sim
 MSmits: but search is easy to write, i have tons of code for other board games. It's the sim that is hard
 MSmits: (for this game)
 c0d1ngr1ff: hi,does anyone have issues with notifications not showing up?
 Butanium: MSmits how did you make your search general enough to be easily serializable&#160;?
 Butanium: like what are the arguments you have to pass
 MSmits: oh, I did not do that. I just paste a bunch of functions from other bots
 MSmits: like selection, solver etc.
 MSmits: takes an hour or two to get it all working unless the game is very different
 MSmits: also depends on wether I want to do some special stuff like transposition tables or optimistic/pessimistic bounds
 MSmits: sometimes they have a simulation function, sometimes just eval etc.
 derjack: any new game the most time consuming part is writing the sim
 derjack: that and adjusting to game's particular i/o
 MSmits: seems like it yeah. Wasnt always like that for me, but once you've written a bunch of searches, they all end up looking more or less the same
 MSmits: the improvements usually come from performance, eval, pruning etc.
 MSmits: unless you're doing nn, then it's a whole other list of jobs to do
 MSmits: I wonder how others did the sim for nmm
 MSmits: I used a lot of lookups for mills and connections
 CatboyCodes: SUS
 Butanium: I guess I need to write some more search then lol
 derjack: huh? no book yet?
 CatboyCodes: SUUUUUUUUUUUS 
 MSmits: not for a while derjack&#160;:)

 MSmits: badum tsss
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: yay search is working
 MSmits: uses 16 million nodes on turn 1 =/
 MSmits: meh seems like it's still bugged too
 Jack777: i quit
 Jack777: dani share code
 jacek: is that much?
 MSmits: 16 million is crazy
 MSmits: lots of branching in this game. Large tree complexity, small state complexity
 MSmits: so when i expand i make a lot of nodes

 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Enjoy KINGOFBIGBOIMEME. You've one day. After that Mods come back.
 KINGOFBIGBOIMEME: what

 KINGOFBIGBOIMEME: Idk
 KINGOFBIGBOIMEME: hey ho do you beat mad pod raceing
 KINGOFBIGBOIMEME: *how
 pikachuboiiiiii: how do you do the distance from checkpoint in javascript in mad pod racing??
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Thinking?
 AntiSquid: KINGOFBIGBOIMEME i can fix it if you wish, but i have no reason to ban, have a good day
 AntiSquid: why do you want him banned blaise&#160;?
 marcelodelazari: bitcoin pump
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Me? I don't care. But if he was banned once...
 AntiSquid: then he redeemed himself and is a brand new person, no? :P
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Right.
 ninnghazad: "GENOCYBER - The cyber monster from an imaginary world!"ha, they don't make lines like that anymore.
 Wontonimo: hey KINGOFBIGBOIMEME and pikachuboiiiiii if you are still looking at mad pod racing I can give you a hand
 GamingGnawer: doing bot-programing without implementing a rigid data-structure seemed such a good idea in wood league.... :tired_face:
 Wontonimo: meh, it's not that bad.  it could work
 Wontonimo: which bot game are you playing GamingGnawer&#160;?
 GamingGnawer: Right now it's legend of code &amp; magic
 Thorcode: oh that's not really easy for me
 Wontonimo: magic the gathering light - copyright
 Wontonimo: havent tried
 GamingGnawer: Thank the stars it's light-version XD
 GamingGnawer: the way the data get's feed from the game makes it quite easy to just make a global array for each attribute because they end up sharing having the same index in all lists
 GamingGnawer: but that's only true until you start making multi-level decision trees or attempt to simulate game states
 Wontonimo: change the global array to an instance of an array
 Wontonimo: and change the functions that modify it into class methods and have the array a class member
 Wontonimo: boom, object oriented programming is born
 GamingGnawer: yeah I now (almost) have card-objects that track a cards every attribute instead of having 10 arrays. I now have one vector ^^
 GamingGnawer: IT'S ALIVE!
 GamingGnawer: (dumb as a rock still, but running!)
 Wontonimo: rocks can kill people if they team up and roll down a hill.  
 GamingGnawer: if you bring a couple of big rocks to an MTG tournament you can beat almost any player
 Thorcode: Gold leagues I'm comming 
 Thorcode: oh sorry I spammed
 Wontonimo: of what thor?
 Wontonimo: that's not spamming
 Thorcode: mad pod race
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: congrats
 Wontonimo: i see you are reducing your speed when approaching a checkpoint
 GamingGnawer: *cheer*
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: i see you are using -v.  have you tried over values like -2*v or -5*v&#160;?
 Thorcode: how you get that wontonimo
 Thorcode: why you know that I use -v
 Westicles: he is notorious hacker
 GamingGnawer: :scream:
 Wontonimo: i look at the replay and i've seen that strategy before
 Thorcode: he just see my replay I get that
 Wontonimo: it is a pretty famous strategy here
 Wontonimo: so it has a very specific look
 Thorcode: :scream_cat:
 Wontonimo: just like all the GA bots have a very specific look
 Thorcode: GA?
 Wontonimo: genetic algorithm
 Thorcode: oh ok
 Wontonimo: sounds really fancy, but at the heart of GA is really just random-ish trials.  Random-ish around the best trials so far
 GamingGnawer: Do you manually breed them between races?
 GamingGnawer: or is there a way to have the bot compete in the Arena while modifying itself?
 Wontonimo: great question
 Wontonimo: you could do it either way, and sure enough people do it some one way and some the other
 Wontonimo: my bot in mad pod racing has a simulation.  I run that simulation about 50,000 times per turn and do the GA each turn.
 Wontonimo: but some people try and bake in intelligence by doing something like GA outside of the game.  They use training outside of the game to find weights for a neural net or for the hyper parameters of their heuristic
 GamingGnawer: ok! cool! So it "learns" how to pathfind within each race but is not able to learn remember it to the next race or to learn from its opponents?
 Wontonimo: in Mars Lander 3 I did a hybrid of GA and heuristic.  Instead of the GA deciding on individual moves, it instead decided on parameters to 5 premade heuristics.  One heuristic was focused on landing, one on fast descent, etc
 Wontonimo: the different heuristics and most of their parameters I found by running the game several times on Coding Game and had my bot print out a debug message of the parameters it discovered worked well
 Wontonimo: then those became the default, and the GA just explored around those while playing later runs
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: :popcorn:
 Wontonimo: here it is in action <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/590011801">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/590011801</a>

 Wontonimo: i am
 Wontonimo: it's my only language

 Thorcode: French is my fourth target

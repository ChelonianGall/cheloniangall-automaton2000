 linjoehan: hello
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 jacek: good morning
 Juan_two: Good morning
 OldJohn: Good morning everyone&#160;!
 derjack: :upside_down:
 DomiKo: godd morning!
 Titann37: hi all
 ghaith_hedi: good morning
 emh: jacek what can you tell me about NN implementation for CG? how many hidden layers do I need? what is better, fixed point or floating point? embed weights in forward propagation or separate code and data for loop performance?
 emh: I guess size matters so then no embedding (instructions would be repeated and consume too much space)
 jacek: i replied there about the size. weights for cg are just lowered precision floats
 jacek: it has only 1 hidden layer
 emh: ok
 Uljahn: how many bits per float? guess model size and precision may benefit from Quantization Aware Training
 jacek: i used normal floats in training. for cg i use my custom int16 divided thing. i divide by 2048.0 so precision is around 0.0005
 jacek: i dont know if this affected the model strength in any way
 emh: I see
 DomiKo: it could affect but it really depends on model, so the only way is to test this. I locally test model vs compressed model to see how much it affects.
 INSANOGUY: hi
 ThomasGottschalk: hey
 INSANOGUY: it me
 INSANOGUY: who r u
 ThomasGottschalk: oh Im new

 INSANOGUY: nice 
 ThomasGottschalk: follow me? what do you mean with that
 INSANOGUY: mean that i be your friend
 ThomasGottschalk: oh yeah sure
 INSANOGUY: thank u

 5DN1L: not here, ThomasGottschalk
 INSANOGUY: what is that
 INSANOGUY: who are you
 INSANOGUY: i do clash
 5DN1L: i'm a chat moderator
 SinnerJyze: No solicitations, right?
 5DN1L: right
 SinnerJyze: I thought so
 omharry: hi
 omharry: hello
 omharry: will anybody be my friend
 omharry: please
 SumolAnanas: me
 omharry: yay
 omharry: are you from france
 omharry: because you have pineapple in ur name
 Frukostbord: Just curious. How many of you work as programmers?
 Nerchio: at least 1
 Uljahn: no more than 2**33
 Crosility: Does making money while programming == work as programmer?
 emh: is it possible to make c++ call an external binary during compile time?
 emh: for example base64
 emh: or zcat
 emh: I found a constexpr base64 function, but calling the binary would be shorter
 emh: I guess I could use bash to do it but would be fun to do it from C++
 derjack: :thinking:
 DomiKo: during compile time???
 ThomasGottschalk: Switzerland
 derjack: and why would he want to compress anything
 derjack: :smirk:

 DaNinja: difficult one, is that for getting a job at Google?
 Phlipside: In C# how can I log notes to the console that aren't taken as part of the answer
 Phlipside: Ah never mind I found it
 Quick_Kick: Console.Error.WriteLine();
 Phlipside: Thanks Quick_Kick&#160;:)
 LuaAdventurer: how do i change my input\
 LuaAdventurer: lua language
 5DN1L: how do i change your question\
 5DN1L: English
 Crosility: Drop down menu at top of code block.
 Crosility: It's alphabetical, and scrolls
 5DN1L: wow you actually understand what the question is? i'm impressed
 Crosility: Only assuming. :joy:
 5DN1L: right :joy:
 5DN1L: LuaAdventurer, hope that answers your question
 derjack: and what language?
 5DN1L: let's ask Automaton2000 what language
 Automaton2000: well it's a good one
 derjack: D?
 5DN1L: D for derjack
 Ayza: does it matter if you can beat most players or not as long as you can beat the boss?
 5DN1L: it's all about getting your trueskill score higher than the boss's
 Ayza: I see, hopes back up
 wlesavo: Ayza well you have to get games against boss, and if you lose to everyone else you wont get any
 Ayza: I am losing to some players but testing my code, it wins against the boss 90% of the time
 Ayza: so I guess it's fine
 Uljahn: losing to bottom league players is very harmful for your score
 5DN1L: but if you keep losing to other players, your trueskill score won't be high
 5DN1L: Ayza check out what trueskill score system is
 wlesavo: yeah, i generaly start climbing by fixing those losses against lower half of ladder, as Uljahn said
 Ayza: alright thanks
 5DN1L: Ayza <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/how-is-the-rank-for-single-finished-bot-programming-computed/194147">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/how-is-the-rank-for-single-finished-bot-programming-computed/194147</a>
 Ayza: thanks couldn't find a clear one
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like alot of people CP just got kicked in the nutz
 eulerscheZahl: participant count was much lower.while the winner gets the same CP, the exploential function drops faster to 0. 10th here is worth less than 10th or even 30th last time
 struct: 1000 points difference between 10th and 3th
 eulerscheZahl: wow. i didn't do the math but didn't expend it to be that significant
 struct: (10000)**((1763-10+1)/1763)-(10000)**((1763-30+1)/1763)= 946.54781786959095688007
 jacek: any significant difference between g*ld and legend?
 eulerscheZahl: but no excuses: i failed the last 2 contests and dropped in the overall contest leaderboard&#160;:(
 struct: jacek yeah legend gives extra few ranks if you make it there on last day
 eulerscheZahl: depends: top gold vs bottom legend? not significanttop gold vs mid legend: there is a difference
 eulerscheZahl: aCat right into mid legend after contest ended
 eulerscheZahl: but not everyone got pushed. siman was really close a few times but didn't make it in the end
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't like that the CP is dropped from previous contest.  So would I have been off NOT entering Event?
 eulerscheZahl: he already stopped on wednesday when topcoder started
 Astrobytes: it wasn't an 'official' contest as such sooo
 eulerscheZahl: official enough to count for contest leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: wrong, PatrickMcGinnisII
 eulerscheZahl: the factor of older contest always declines. regardless of whether you play or not
 Astrobytes: Fair point. Then they would have to make a different formula to account for smaller participation count to make it balance
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: pending on your rank in this and the previous it will either not count top your best 3 (as if you never played) or increase the score
 eulerscheZahl: ergo: you can't make it worse by playing
 struct: I dont think the problem is the points here
 struct: is the points you lose on the others
 struct: the decay
 Crosility: Everything dies. Even your points *lol*
 struct: But if there wasnt a decay, players would never catch older players
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Each next most recent contest is worth 5% less ... that adds up
 Astrobytes: A moot point, as always.
 eulerscheZahl: they have an exponential decay regarding your rank for scores. i think that's fair
 struct: I think 10k is fair because the contests are still hard even if there are fewer players
 struct: The top players were still there
 Astrobytes: I'm just grateful we had another one
 darkhorse64: you must be within the 5% to score (no pun intended)
 eulerscheZahl: we can argue that 10th out of 1000 is harder than 100th out of 10000. because some top players always compete and the occasional participants are less strong on average
 eulerscheZahl: recurse once proposed the kaggle formula for the leaderboard and even computed some numbers with it. looked pretty fair to me
 eulerscheZahl: still rewarding top ranks in older contests a bit but also giving new players a chance to climb fast
 Astrobytes: I remember that, but they went with the other one instead
 eulerscheZahl: with more contests, player count will probably decrease further. making the decay for older contests even more severe
 Astrobytes: Stuck between a rock and a hard place 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: to maintain your cp you would have to rank higher than your average by a hair to maintain it.  When participation is low the burden is higher.
 eulerscheZahl: at least i don't intend to participate when they temporarily promote some board game and call it a contest
 struct: wdym player count will decrease with more contests?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i get encouraging new participants
 Astrobytes: If they increase contest count with new ones like this I'm all in
 eulerscheZahl: imagine you have another event in 1 or 2 months. but not a new game
 eulerscheZahl: this time we had 1700 players, which was pretty cool
 struct: Well this one felt rushed
 eulerscheZahl: but don't expect the same amount for a connect4 contest
 eulerscheZahl: i might be wrong, just my feeling
 struct: ofc not, and I hope it doesnt happen
 struct: it will just be booked like othello is
 Astrobytes: lol, right
 eulerscheZahl: replace connect4 by any existing community game
 derjack: onitama :heart:
 Westicles: no chance, connect4 isn't french
 darkhorse64: a fresh board game would be more interesting ataxx 
 darkhorse64: for instance
 darkhorse64: it rules out books
 Astrobytes: lol, I like how you shoehorned ataxx in there darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: :smiling_imp:
 struct: still not close to enough depth
 derjack: :notebook: :soccer:
 Westicles: 8/9 events french, 1 german
 eulerscheZahl: the german must me mine then
 derjack: so what are french community games
 eulerscheZahl: penguins
 derjack: dots and boxes!
 Astrobytes: the upcoming 6 nimmt
 darkhorse64: I already started working on it
 eulerscheZahl: 6 nimmt?
 darkhorse64: there are new search algos to try out
 eulerscheZahl: i'm slightly disappointed that no one managed to crack RNG&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess we can regain cp when/if it hits multi?
 derjack: does it have complicated rules?
 eulerscheZahl: for 6 nimmt the random impact will be massive
 Astrobytes: no I wasn't suggesting it as a contest
 Astrobytes: someone asked for French board games, I assumed board games made by French people
 derjack: Sebastien wrote in pm that he'd use SecureRandom
 eulerscheZahl: too late, not it's in the draw pot
 darkhorse64: it will be very hard to reach legend in Green Circle, much more than spider attack. Farewell CPs
 eulerscheZahl: i mean it will be hard to play as a coder. we already struggled with random here
 eulerscheZahl: you can do it darkhorse64, i have faith in you
 struct: darkhorse64 all I changed from 60 to top 3
 Astrobytes: ah, yeah, but it encourages different thinking
 struct: was pruning moves
 struct: and make the opening better
 eulerscheZahl: i just hardcoded the opening moves
 Astrobytes: For instance,  the success with some clevery modified MCTS-style algos in Green Circle was nice 
 eulerscheZahl: smits gave me his code. i think that's the main point why i ranked above him
 Astrobytes: the opening?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: He didn't hardcode the opening at all? I was under the impression he did, at least at some point
 eulerscheZahl: can't copy to chat, pastebin broken
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/elrn0Vb.png">https://i.imgur.com/elrn0Vb.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: he had an outcommented call to Heuristic()
 eulerscheZahl: i hardcoded a few moves at least. significant boost in ranking
 darkhorse64: In my bot, I did not care enough of the opponent when releasing apps  
 Astrobytes: yeah I knew about yours but smits, not like him not to find something simple like that
 darkhorse64: I can't believe he did not book the opening
 Astrobytes: In my bot, I failed :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: void NormalTurn(){	//if (Heuristics())	//	return;
 eulerscheZahl: leaking smits code
 Astrobytes: I don't think he's be concerned about that particular 'leak' :D
 Astrobytes: *he'd
 Astrobytes: euler, did you see new yare update?
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the announcement
 Astrobytes: yeah I didn't check the details yet
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't look into it yet apart from a quick check
 derjack: yare yare?
 Dapps: i was going to check it out, but deciding if i spend more time on that or try green circle when it becomes a multi
 darkhorse64: I have looked at bowowow  Twitter. Apparently, he used ISMCTS, that's more interesting to try than tweaking magic numbers
 eulerscheZahl: you can code modules now. which makes it easier to code your own UI around the game for manual controls
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: yes, did you see his PM?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/06/28/210200">https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/06/28/210200</a>
 Astrobytes: he also did something in the CG thread
 darkhorse64: No thanks. An algorithm to see through the fog
 darkhorse64: yummy
 Astrobytes: and Duck seems to have some hybrid of that and EPT
 Dapps: re: yare i'm not so interested in manually controlling though. would prefer fully-automated
 eulerscheZahl: i accept that yare is a different concept from CG and might even go the hybrid way
 Astrobytes: same Dapps, though that guy last time who was playing manually was pretty damn good
 struct: what is yare?
 Dapps: yeah i think winner was fully manual
 eulerscheZahl: the macro game is pretty heuristic based
 eulerscheZahl: yare.io struct
 Astrobytes: And his setup was really nice
 struct: is it down?
 Astrobytes: how he managed to play like that is beyond me
 Dapps: lol
 eulerscheZahl: can be painful to code for some cases. and in the last contest i had some bugs that were only triggered in contest games and not the few dummy bots to play against
 Dapps: yea yare.io looks down. DDOS lol
 Dapps: from the few of us checking it out
 eulerscheZahl: manual controls for macro and automation of micro (attacking a specific target among several options, jumping for fast reaction)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VIE8k0F34&amp;ab_channel=Yare-io">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VIE8k0F34&amp;ab_channel=Yare-io</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yare gameplay (version 1)
 derjack: 1 ethereum?
 eulerscheZahl: v2 will change some mechanics
 Dapps: yep
 eulerscheZahl: back then 1 ETH was worth more
 eulerscheZahl: should have sold
 Dapps: jokes on you. i didn't win so didn't lose anything
 eulerscheZahl: :chart_with_downwards_trend:
 Astrobytes: you didn't sell or spend that? wow
 Astrobytes: for a maths guy that was an oversight :P
 eulerscheZahl: at first it was rising in value
 eulerscheZahl: i still have about 0.1BTC that i won at hackerrank
 Astrobytes: but it's exactly the same as stock market shares
 eulerscheZahl: was $75
 struct: it only dropped 66% not bad
 eulerscheZahl: jeez, BTC under 20k euros
 eulerscheZahl: that's painful to watch
 Astrobytes: you could have bought yourself a fake identity with the ETH and had double the chance to win this year :P
 eulerscheZahl: i would need 2 bots to make it less obvious
 eulerscheZahl: and there's a possibility that i can fight myself
 Dapps: put in a backdoor to detect that matchup
 eulerscheZahl: there's also an andergee on yare btw
 Astrobytes: still a higher chance, and you vs you in the finals would be easy to sabotage
 eulerscheZahl: he was top10 in halite
 Astrobytes: interesting
 Dapps: did you guys check out kore on kaggle?
 Dapps: couldn't get myself interested in it
 eulerscheZahl: quick look
 eulerscheZahl: it's just so much stuff going on, you can't play it all
 Astrobytes: I had a brief look yesterday, looked halite-ish
 eulerscheZahl: coder one is in 2 months
 Dapps: find kaggle graphics so bad though.. actually takes away from gameplay
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder regionals in early august (i think everyone can enter here)
 Astrobytes: I dislike their whole site tbh
 Astrobytes: and topcoders :D
 eulerscheZahl: you don't find anything without a bookmark
 Dapps: don't like the entire kaggle matchmaking system with "ghosts" 
 eulerscheZahl: i never played kaggle because it always lasts so long
 eulerscheZahl: and i have a serious addiction problem if i get into it
 Astrobytes: Still, I guess with fewer CG contests we have to bite a few bullets and embrace some differences
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder it is. platform is a pain but the optim tasks are in the range from good to great
 struct: anything about a new contest has been mentioned?
 eulerscheZahl: CG contest?
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 Astrobytes: was short notice last time, I would never have seen it if I didn't happen to log in just after 5D posting the link
 eulerscheZahl: i found out about it because astro told me
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Hakb: hi, is there any way to get the time and memory consumption and  on training puzzles?
 struct: well for memory you should be tracking it yourself 
 struct: you have 768MB
 struct: for the time you can also track it
 Astrobytes: You won't be able to track the execution time/mem consumption for the validators but the testcases should give you an idea
 Crosility: You are the 3 names I see the most here in chat. struct, eulerscheZahl, and Astrobytes.
 Astrobytes: not always&#160;;)I take extended breaks from here these days
 eulerscheZahl: is see eulerscheZahl quite often too. acutally he's always online when i'm here
 Astrobytes: :D
 Crosility: Aww, a funny one&#160;:]
 eulerscheZahl: if astro laughs, it counts
 Astrobytes: Just watch out for that undercover one
 Crosility: Well, it's nice, honestly. Seeing the same people. It feels like a community.
 Astrobytes: hah!
 Astrobytes: Crosility: yeah,  the community was always the backbone of this place
 Hakb: ok ty astrobytes
 Astrobytes: contest-time you still see a lot of familiar names, not as many nowadays though sadly
 eulerscheZahl: do you ask for a particular reason like failing a testcase Hakb?
 Crosility: What would cause more decent-like minded people to flock here? I wonder?
 Astrobytes: More contests, end-of. As it was previously. The turnout for official contests is huge
 struct: Maybe a contest this year is still possible
 struct: who knows
 Astrobytes: But as with most things in life, things do indeed sadly change.
 Astrobytes: I have a feeling they will do a proper Fall contest struct
 Crosility: Was the event that just ended, not considered a contest?
 Dapps: i wish i had found CG earlier. only joined last year. but saw previous years multiple contests a year
 putibuzu: how many contests were there previously?
 eulerscheZahl: about 5 per year
 putibuzu: wow
 Astrobytes: 2018 was the record year right? 7 or 8 contests?
 Astrobytes: or 6 or 7
 Dapps: 8?!
 eulerscheZahl: you can't count locam twice
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 Astrobytes: I wasn't
 eulerscheZahl: and pikatcha can be argued about
 struct: page takes a while to load
 Astrobytes: 6, plus there were a few semi-privates that we gatecrashed
 struct: also fall challenge 21 is not a thing
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: That was the Fail Challenge 21
 struct: Its past
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/games">https://escape.codingame.com/games</a>the list grew since i opened it last time
 Astrobytes: but I'll be really happy if there is a proper one this year, and hopefully another 1+ community-style like the last one
 IvesL: what is a pro account in escape?
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, a few new ones
 struct: accounts from CG work I think
 putibuzu: yeah a fall contest would be really nice&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: someone (you?) told me there might be another community contest around fall
 Astrobytes: no, that was this one I was talking about, T mentioned it prior to Spring or just after
 eulerscheZahl: and i expect an official contest in autumn (last time it was in November). we just don't know if it will be a bot contest
 eulerscheZahl: but nothing official, just some educated guess from my side
 Astrobytes: :fingers_crossed:
 struct: shirt or delete
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Incorrigible you are struct
 Crosility: O.o, unable to be improved?
 Astrobytes: No, he never changes: "x or delete" is struct's personal motto/meme
 Crosility: Ah.
 eulerscheZahl: there is also "no sleep till legend". but that's another user
 Astrobytes: ahh the world of CG memes
 Astrobytes: Speaking of CG memes, ceg gave up early this contest
 eulerscheZahl: he was playing?
 eulerscheZahl: regarding memes<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/850088a159bea424cb5e8f502cc34eabda16ff">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/850088a159bea424cb5e8f502cc34eabda16ff</a>
 Astrobytes: He streamed
 darkhorse64: He could not pass the bot without reading the statement
 Astrobytes: I think he remained in Wood
 Astrobytes: hahaha forgot about that one euler
 eulerscheZahl: jacek didn't read the statement either
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I admit I was mildly surprised that nobody showed up at the last minute
 GNye22: Can you private message another coder on the site that's not in this chat?
 GNye22: I did a Clash of Code with him and looked at his code and was wondering what the one line did
 Crosility: Go to their profile. Click their name.
 GNye22: I'm on his profile
 Crosility: Message them-not sure if there's a seperate inbox, but it opens up a tab here.
 struct: they need to be following you
 GNye22: All i see is a follow button 
 struct: and you need to follow them too
 GNye22: ohhhhhh well dang
 GNye22: well then would anyone know what this does?
 Astrobytes: Otherwise you can use the forum
 Crosility: You could try contacting them on discord.
 GNye22: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5cde6c6-efbe-4eb2-9b55-e36b56d7cef8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5cde6c6-efbe-4eb2-9b55-e36b56d7cef8</a>
 struct: or you can press the person button on chat
 Astrobytes: ^ or discord yes
 struct: when you join in a clash with them
 GNye22: It was a program that converts characters to their ascii values and sums them if the characters uppercase
 struct: and then click on their name
 Astrobytes: auto pastebins are broken no?
 struct: GNye22 golf?
 GNye22: but I want to know what the&#160;!!std::isupper(c))*c; line does
 Phlipside: With Mod Pod racing Test In Arena isn't enough for me to go against the boss even though I'm consistently beating it in Play My Code mode... how do I get it to attempt to rank me up?
 GNye22: no struct, just a flash clash
 GNye22: O
 GNye22: I've never seen the&#160;!! operator 
 GNye22: And when I google it nothing appears
 struct: p gets.tr('^A-Z',<i>).sum</i>
 Astrobytes: Beat the rest of the league Phlipside
 Phlipside: Do you mean I have to rank #1?
 Astrobytes: Look at who you lose against the most, and why, try to fix that and you should move up the league and get more games against the boss
 Astrobytes: Yes
 GNye22: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/df4878c5-dc55-43f9-af07-0786992568da">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/df4878c5-dc55-43f9-af07-0786992568da</a>
 Astrobytes: You must have more points than the boss
 GNye22: int sum = 0;
 Astrobytes: At the end of the submission time
 Phlipside: Thank you Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: np
 GNye22: does anyone know what that (!!std::isupper(c))*c does?
 Phlipside: how do I see the Boss' number of points compared to mine?
 eulerscheZahl: std::isupper is 1 for upper case, 0 otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: so 0 * c = 01*c = 1
 eulerscheZahl: c is the ASCII value of the character
 GNye22: oohhhhh ok
 GNye22: so then whats with the double negation?
 eulerscheZahl: this it add the ASCII of all non-uppercase chars
 eulerscheZahl: oh, double
 struct: shortest I can think of p`dd`.tr('^A-Z',<i>).sum</i>
 eulerscheZahl: bad eyes

 GNye22: that's the part that confuses me, couldn't he have just put std::isupper(c)*c?
 Astrobytes: Phlipside: Hit the leaderboard button on the left
 timbersson: in js you use it to force a value to be boolean, but that is c, right?
 eulerscheZahl: just looking it up. might be that it just returns any non-0 number
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/cctype/isupper/">https://cplusplus.com/reference/cctype/isupper/</a>
 Astrobytes: C++
 GNye22: c++
 Nerchio: c++
 eulerscheZahl: A value different from zero (i.e., true) if indeed c is an uppercase alphabetic letter.
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't guaranteed to get a 1 for upper. might be a 7 or a -432432
 Crosility: Okay, okay.. okay. C++. Sorry, I think the answer they give still applies though.
 Astrobytes: double negated then multiplied by the ascii value?
 Astrobytes: sorry, just reading it
 eulerscheZahl: negate: 0 =&gt; 1, anything else =&gt; 0
 eulerscheZahl: double negate: 0 =&gt; 0, anything else =&gt; 1
 Astrobytes: I would never have worked that out :smirk:

 eulerscheZahl: sarcasm Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Naturally
 GNye22: Ahhhhh ok that makes sense now
 GNye22: very clever
 Crosility: But, both links said the exact same thing.
 Astrobytes: ugly though
 GNye22: I will definitely use that from now on haha
 derjack: they use c++ for shortest?
 eulerscheZahl: golfing is ugly
 GNye22: No it was a fast clash
 eulerscheZahl: or wasteful to water, depending on the type of golf
 derjack: hmm what would be the new featured puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: insert link to lastweektonight from this week
 Astrobytes: Fastest also produces ugly code
 GNye22: but yeah golfing is ugly, but its a good skill to have I think. I watch some of these pythoners and they populate a map in a single freakin line and I'm like whaaaaaaatttt
 GNye22: I agree, but its a good exercise to see what libraries you know, just not good practice for writing code that is going to be updated and viewed by others
 eulerscheZahl: don't code like that in production
 Nerchio: meh kinda useless skill to me
 Astrobytes: More of a hobby-thing
 eulerscheZahl: when you have to think about what it's doing and then say: "hm, clever", you probably shouldn't do it
 Astrobytes: The only time golfing everything is acceptable in production is writing perl
 GNye22: Yeah I'm aware, I just like learning new little tricks like that cuz a lot of them take advantage of small rules in the language that you otherwise would be aware of
 Astrobytes: &lt;that was a joke btw&gt;
 Astrobytes: (I'm here all week)
 Crosility: While I'm over here doing explicitly long variable names.
 Crosility: In very defined chunks of code.
 Crosility: To solve puzzles.
 struct: thats fine
 Crosility: char blunderdirection = 'S'; and map[height][length].. instead of m[y][x]
 eulerscheZahl: grid[x,y]the only acceptable order of dimensions
 Crosility: Like struct's example. Of shortest code. .. I can't see why people do that to themselves.
 eulerscheZahl: there's even a language just for golfing: golfscript
 struct: [y][x] for me
 Crosility: Lol, Euler, if only the site didn't continuously give me strings at a time. And work top to bottom. I would do that. But it's too much work to make map[][y] = "this string it gave me"
 struct: or uint64
 Crosility: So, I've opted to just apply it in the logic flow the site gives to me. :P
 Crosility: But yes, x, y for everything else.
 Crosility: I like using 2d arrays too much for these map puzzles. I don't wanna store an array of strings. I rather be able to call the coordinates directly.
 Astrobytes: map[] [solved]
 Astrobytes: map[MAX_SIZE*MAX_SIZE] that is
 Astrobytes: or uint64 if it fits
 Crosility: Oh, well, yes. YOU CAN define it that way. BUT, it's not easy-to-read and follow way.
 eulerscheZahl: let's make it a dictionary.can JS use an object like {x;1, y:3} as key?
 Crosility: When you're calling grid spacing.
 eulerscheZahl: then it's independent of the order
 Crosility: Haha, JS nice modern dictionary benefits.
 Astrobytes: if you wrap things up nicely in a struct or class it's very easy to read when you're using it
 Phlipside: Thanks for the advice Astrobytes, just ranked up in the league with a &gt; 95% win rate
 Astrobytes: Phlipside: Nice! :tada: onwards and upwards
 Crosility: Lol, technically.. it's an array of y,x coordinate structs. With data relevant to the coordinate.
 Crosility: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0cfdbd3-725a-46ac-ba6b-f651fd449003">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0cfdbd3-725a-46ac-ba6b-f651fd449003</a>
 Crosility: Gah, I need to learn the character length here.
 Astrobytes: it's based on line breaks iirc
 eulerscheZahl: arrow up to recover your last message
 eulerscheZahl: 4 lines are the max
 Crosility: ypedef struct {
 struct: has anyone reported that pastebins are broken?
 Astrobytes: jacek did ages ago
 Crosility: Asks the moderator. :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and did someone react with :eyes:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: dunno, don't think so, not on discord rn to check
 Crosility: So, Astrobytes, in C, curious, what would you do, to be able to easily call a cell of Y,X (or X, Y) if not in a 2d Array like so? Just curious.
 Nerchio: don't remind them to remove the chat :cold_sweat:
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they will just forget it?
 Astrobytes: in C I would probably use your way unless 1D indexing helped
 struct: just make a forum post asking to not remove it
 struct: eas
 struct: easy*
 Astrobytes: *helped with speed/efficiency
 Crosility: 1D indexing like you proposed, only works if you're willing to deal with ugly syntax. :P
 Astrobytes: in C that's what macros are for :P
 struct: then ask people in chat to brigade the post
 Crosility: Haha, yup. Man, haven't used a macro in forever.
 Crosility: Need to try implementing them more.
 Crosility: (Other than library pre-made macros)
 Astrobytes: it's easier to hide ugliness away in C++ than it is in C tbh
 Astrobytes: For CG at least
 Astrobytes: re. the chat, someone made a nice post in the thread on the forum
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/8">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/8</a>
 Astrobytes: Razovsk y post. Not like it hasn't been suggested before though
 struct: yeah probably wont make a difference
 struct: but he is right, the discord also has problems
 eulerscheZahl: i left because the phishing links annoyed me
 Astrobytes: Yes. The spam issue makes me silence the whole thing
 Crosility: I fully turn off notifications/alerts to every discord channel I join. Only if I'm tagged directly do I go to the chat, or if I'm curious.
 Crosility: Most servers are just spam.
 Astrobytes: I keep it on for the announcements/important channel or I leave the server
 struct: During the contest I banned 1 person in total
 eulerscheZahl: same. when i join a server i mute everything but the annoucnement channel and maybe 1 or 2 others
 struct: The chat had problems during a month or so
 Astrobytes: struct yeah the chat during the contest was unusually spam/troll free, other than us all trolling each other
 Astrobytes: Was very pleasant
 struct: For me shutting it down its mistake
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder discord was quite spammylike admins writing "@everyone go to typeracer and join us"
 eulerscheZahl: at least they made the typeracer thing a group on their own now
 Astrobytes: that @everyone tag is so annoying. Servers that limit their use of it are the better ones
 eulerscheZahl: but it was the admins pinging everyone for typeracer
 struct: lol
 Nikanameu: do featured puzzle give any bonus rewards
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's irresponsible admin'ing imo
 Astrobytes: @everyone is like the nuclear option of notification
 eulerscheZahl: it's perfectly fine for "we just released yare2 after almost a year"
 Astrobytes: Yes exactly.
 Astrobytes: Not to be abused for spamming stuff
 struct: hi @everyone
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I'm amazed TC didn't lose most of their discord doing what you described euler
 eulerscheZahl: i left
 eulerscheZahl: but rejoined for TCO info
 struct: Thats when you know it has gone downhill 
 eulerscheZahl: they still have some annoying practices. write !work to gain useless internet points
 eulerscheZahl: for some channels only. so someone writes in the wrong channel. bot: "don't do that here" and instantly someone else tries the same nonsense
 Astrobytes: Yes, I was on there for a short time iirc
 struct: thats why I dont even go on discord
 Astrobytes: You see that stuff in quite a few servers nowadays, exceptionally annoying
 Crosility: If you ever wanna see the most degenerative behavior. Join a crypto-game server.
 Astrobytes: No. Thank. You :D
 Crosility: Lmao.
 Astrobytes: These people are rabid.
 Astrobytes: alrighty, afk a couple hours, be back later on at some point
 eulerscheZahl: there's so much weird stuff on the internet. i'll never understand asmr
 Crosility: ... I need to back out of that discussion.
 Crosility: Twitch has fallen so far
 jacek: hm?
 Razovsky: eulerscheZahl if i find a asmrdude or girl i swear ill rip their ears off
 Razovsky: this triggers me so hard, exactly the contrary of what it's supposed to do i guess XD
 Crosility: Avoid what'sherface-IWearABikiniAllDayInAKiddyPool on twitch then.
 Crosility: Asmortanthoho or whatever.
 Razovsky: i never go on twitch except for a few entertaining gamers i know
 Razovsky: strangely they are all males, i never found a female streamer which wasnt selling herself with it
 Razovsky: mst exist, anyway
 Razovsky: must*
 Crosility: I know a few. But, the play niche content usually.
 Crosility: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/gabsmolders">https://www.twitch.tv/gabsmolders</a>
 Crosility: Also usually the huge nerds, the real nerds.
 Crosility: Not the "I want people to look at me"
 Nikanameu: your channel?
 Crosility: Nah, that's not mine.
 jacek: Razovsky misophonia much?
 Razovsky: nah man
 Razovsky: im really fond of music, i play a lot 
 Razovsky: and within several groups
 eulerscheZahl: Razovsky 05:58ᴾᴹeulerscheZahl if i find a asmrdude or girl i swear ill rip their ears off
 Razovsky: but ASMR is a mystery to me, i stand with eulerscheZahl on that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm half deaf, When i put on my Aeropex and can actually hear what pepl r sayin' ... I think i understand ASMR now.  But my urge is to pick up a machete.
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i didn't know. smits also has some problems hearing. but he can lip-read is students and catches them saying things smits is't supposed to hear
 eulerscheZahl: *his
 Astrobytes: ASMR is for people who never had someone whisper aggressively in their ears as a child or something. It's an absolute mystery.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: me 2, CoV-19 with all the masks was a MF 4 me, I didn't have headphones then.  Waitresses would yell at me, umm that didn't help.
 Astrobytes: that sucks Patrick
 Nikanameu: was the contest fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they think I didn't her them at all, it just takes me longer to interpret what they said so they get impatient and start yelling... I don't know what ASMR is, but I kinda get in now
 Astrobytes: As if provision for those hard of hearing isn't bad enough as it is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm just lacking in certain frequencies, so louder the 'good tones' feel like attacks on my senses.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry, TMI
 Astrobytes: I have tinnitus in my right ear (mostly) which is my constant companion&#160;:|
 eulerscheZahl: i have an organ player among my colleagues. he hears significantly worse on certain frequences
 eulerscheZahl: you get to make a hearing test among others at my workplace when getting hired. the medic asked him right away if he plays organ
 Astrobytes: I will refrain from making any organ-based jokes that only Patrick would laugh at
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i wake up to tinn. everyday, no idea why ... but I burnt my eardrums on loud metal after having surgery like 30 years ago.  I still love rolling up to the gas station blaring what most people find obnoxious.  The pandandlers leave me alone.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, a lifetime of hardcore techno, hardcore/punk, metal and DnB has done my ears no favours
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have 3 concerts lined up this year to attend.  And Astrobytes can keep his Organs to himself.  ;)
 MFogleman: Are they ever going to give clash of code the option to pick your game type?  Fastest mode is just a typing contest and reverse is half luck.  It seems like a significant number of people just quit as soon as its not code golf
 Astrobytes: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can u exit a clash w/o losing points?
 Astrobytes: The only winning move in clash is not to play.
 eulerscheZahl: there seems to be a way of finding out the type beforehand via inspecting the traffic
 eulerscheZahl: but you can't actively choose the type
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wargames ^
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Did we hear anything back from j4at about that?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't
 struct: you only need to check playClash
 struct: once you enter the lobby
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to enter the lobby
 Astrobytes: ^
 Nikanameu: why so long promotion timer
 eulerscheZahl: to force you to take a break
 eulerscheZahl: not even kidding, i wish i was
 eulerscheZahl: for higher leagues the break becomes longer. 6 hours
 Astrobytes: Similar systems should be introduced in all workplaces.
 struct: this is why I submit from wood to legend all in one
 Astrobytes: 7-day promotion
 Astrobytes: (tiny little exaggeration there)
 eulerscheZahl: you want to get promoted every 7 days at work?
 Astrobytes: No, the second statement was a reply to struct. Though 7-day work promotions would be good too.
 eulerscheZahl: could help to counter inflation
 Darleanow: Abraham i lost the convo xD
 Astrobytes: Abraham?
 Darleanow: i was talking to a mate in a clash&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ah gotcha&#160;:)
 struct: you are in class and not trolling world chat?
 struct: o.o
 struct: Didnt know this was possible
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 BrunoFelthes: is there any other way to sync an external file without use the chrome extension? 
 struct: are you talking about CG Sync BrunoFelthes?
 BrunoFelthes: yes
 struct: You can use CG Local, it also works for firefox
 struct: also works for chrome
 BrunoFelthes: my company blocks extensions
 struct: and you dont need to login on store
 struct: ah
 struct: well CG local also requires an extension
 BrunoFelthes: yeah, i cant install extensions
 eulerscheZahl: i never got that: what's wrong with copy-paste to IDE?
 struct: you might paste it into chat accidentally
 eulerscheZahl: pastebins don't work
 Nerchio: too long euler :D
 BrunoFelthes: i do not work with one file
 eulerscheZahl: me neither. i merge it into one file on build
 BrunoFelthes: i work with mult files, and i have a command that merge the files and create a new file
 jacek: cat a b c &gt; d [solved]
 BrunoFelthes: and open the merged file, copy and paste?
 BrunoFelthes: i'm just lazzy
 Kellthazar: maybe a command to put the merged result to the clipboard
 BrunoFelthes: maybe it will help
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/eCMTFnR">https://imgur.com/a/eCMTFnR</a>that's how my setup looks like
 eulerscheZahl: the merged file in the bottom corner doesn't cost much space and is easily accessible for copy
 jacek: Book.cs :thinking:
 jediwannabe06: dooky
 BrunoFelthes: nice setup
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't much of a help to download 500 replays from a top player and hardcode the openings from there
 jacek: seems the 'stateless' mcts was a choice of algorithm by top players
 Kellthazar: how do you folks work with the replay data? Is any export functionality to do so?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/the-codingame-api">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/the-codingame-api</a>
 eulerscheZahl: parsing can be a pain sometimes. it's easy to extract stderr for your own bot
 eulerscheZahl: but i wanted to scrape replays of other users. luckily the game summary was pretty excessive
 jacek: but later
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/wm4repsX">https://pastebin.com/wm4repsX</a>not the prettiest but did the job
 Kellthazar: Cool!
 Nerchio: oh my god :D
 Nerchio: my eyes
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote that in an hour or so
 Nerchio: my drawing function was 7 loops inside one another couldnt bother doing anything else
 eulerscheZahl: wait, what? why? how?
 Nerchio: especially when you are tired the simplest option sounds the best, hard to make mistakes
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see why you need loops there
 Nerchio: you dont need loops
 eulerscheZahl: also an important rule: don't code while tired. it will always backfire
 gfhnpkv: my code got delete 2 times already how do i save it?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/HhNkrtg3">https://pastebin.com/HhNkrtg3</a> it was for discard actually,  no judging :joy:
 struct: you just need to press play my code for it to save
 gfhnpkv: nice thx
 eulerscheZahl: int sumDiscarded = i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q;
 eulerscheZahl: that's one way to do it
 eulerscheZahl: not the most efficient but it works
 eulerscheZahl: you understood the theme of the contest
 Nerchio: i was tired of writing sim for that game so yeah whatever works works
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: what people would do just not to read the rules
 struct: I just used recursion
 eulerscheZahl: i threw one card. then another. causing duplicate states (throw bonus and coding, next throw coding and bonus)
 eulerscheZahl: then zobrist hashing to find the duplicate
 struct: for that  I had "Double throw" on my action gen
 struct: and just dif for (i...)for(j=i){actions[size++].throwAction(i,j);...
 Nerchio: see euler that's a lot of work, and this ugly code not only I was sure was going to work but also didn't do any duplicates
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted to catch a few other potential duplicates as well
 StevenV: Hello guys
 struct: hi
 Kellthazar: Does anyone understand the 64-bit representation of Cards that bowwow posted in his PM?
 StevenV: normally we would have a discussion topic on CG after a contest. Do we have it for GreenCircle?
 Nerchio: sure
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/green-circle-feedback-strategies/196574">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/green-circle-feedback-strategies/196574</a>
 Nikanameu: another promotion 2 hours much wow
 StevenV: how can I find this link @Nerchio?
 Nerchio: main page -&gt; community -&gt; forums or in IDE on the left side forums
 Nerchio: and then find it in the list somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: forum used to be a point on its own in the top bar
 struct: Kellthazar its just to fit everything you need in 8 bytes
 StevenV: I don't do that for the other contests, but I can still find the post somehow.
 StevenV: I just forget how can I do it in the past&#160;:?
 struct: 4 bits cant store up to 16 different values
 struct: when he played review
 struct: it would look somethign like this, give me 1 min
 eulerscheZahl: search "feedback and strategies" + name of the game
 simone.pelloni: ue
 eulerscheZahl: often the post mortes are also linked on the problem overview page
 struct: discard_pile += 0x200000000ULL;
 struct: hand -= 0x1000000ULL;
 struct: played_cards += 0x1000000ULL;
 StevenV: thank you guys :D
 struct: oh but he could do bit.bonus += 2;
 struct: with the union
 jacek: so people did do bitboards in this game
 struct: ofc, I did too
 struct: not bitboard
 struct: just packed data

 Washier: where can I find this card game?
 struct: We need to wait for cg to release it
 Washier: ah ok
 Westicles: new puzzle event tomorrow, could be freecell
 jacek: is it french
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely
 StevenV: I wonder If we have fall challenge 2022 or not
 Kellthazar: thanks, struct. I'm not familiar with this kind of representation.

 StevenV: wow
 eulerscheZahl: ah, bit fields
 eulerscheZahl: oh, was linked a few messages above. sorry
 wlesavo: oh, val and bowwow shared pms, nice, almost thought they wont
 Kellthazar: Oh, I'm reading now that bitfield is not supported in Golang.
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: both wrote PMs in the past
 eulerscheZahl: and usually another one on hatenablog that's more detailed

 wlesavo: oh thx
 wlesavo: i really liked the random node states aspect
 Kellthazar: Japan did pretty well in this contest.
 eulerscheZahl: japan is strrong on CG in general
 jacek: we need to get more weeb
 eulerscheZahl: also on topcoder optim. and on atcoder of course
 wlesavo: atcoder is the one cho kudai established?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea who founded it
 eulerscheZahl: they have algorithmic contests (like codeforces) and an optim once a month
 Kellthazar: 145 / 5.000Resultados de traduçãoI wish I had known this world of competitive programming when I was younger or that there was this kind of community in my college days.
 eulerscheZahl: you have us now
 DomiKo: euler atcoder is weird
 eulerscheZahl: in what way?
 eulerscheZahl: easier to navigate than topcoder
 DomiKo: it isn't just a regular site like codeforces. 
 eulerscheZahl: i never really got into it. what are the differences?
 DomiKo: you can do well in competitive programing in general but you won't at atcoder
 eulerscheZahl: different tasks?
 wlesavo: yeah, just googled it, he did founded atcoder
 DomiKo: competitive programing have many hmmmm let's say different styles of tasks
 DomiKo: and atcoder style is really hard for most not Japanese programers
 eulerscheZahl: i'm doing ok-ish on codejam but i'm a huge failure in some codeforces rounds. so i know what you mean
 struct: you can do well at bot programming and very bad on codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: and i did really well on some hackerrank rounds
 DomiKo: I know many grandmasters from CF that can't do second or even first task at atcoder contest
 StevenV: they are very different
 eulerscheZahl: like 20 out of 10k
 DomiKo: so that's why atcoder is mostly Japanese, and only some really good programmers compete with them
 eulerscheZahl: ok, that sounds extremely strange. i never tried their algorithmic rounds
 eulerscheZahl: had a look at their schedule, was in the middle of the night
 struct: I tried both, I was so bad and both that I just quit
 struct: bad at both*
 eulerscheZahl: i enjoyed the hackerrank style. then hackerrank quit
 eulerscheZahl: now they have occasional contests. for women only. or with $500 for the winner. but you can't keep but have to donate to a charity from a given list
 jacek: i identify as woman
 eulerscheZahl: with organizations like "black women who code"
 jacek: oO
 DomiKo: yeah that's true
 eulerscheZahl: not even cherry picking. they are all called like that
 Nikanameu: domiko give an example of why it's as hard as you say
 DomiKo: I've written only one contest at hackerrank
 eulerscheZahl: you were a problem setter? cool
 DomiKo: no no
 DomiKo: I participated*
 eulerscheZahl: oh. less impressive :D
 DomiKo: Nikanameu I can't really explain it, they are just so different and most competitive programmers are really used to some types of tasks, and if you give them different ones then won't be that good
 Nikanameu: is there a language barrier problem
 DomiKo: not really
 eulerscheZahl: i see surprisingly many struggle with interactive problems
 eulerscheZahl: here on CG they are fairly common
 jacek: i/o stuff?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's the logic of getting extra information during the run
 eulerscheZahl: somehow their minds don't work like that. querying for more relevant info
 DomiKo:  Nikanameu can give you an example of styles.If you gave me a task from Polish competition. I would tell you if that task was from Warsaw, Wroclaw or Krakow. In each site people have a little different style of tasks, and we can mostly easily tell the difference.
 Nikanameu: problem statement?
 eulerscheZahl: task
 Kellthazar: I didn't know Chokudai. Pretty impressive.
 DomiKo: it's not about writing style
 DomiKo: it's about task "style"
 jacek: you need to watch more anime
 struct: if its a portuguese task it will be add a and b.

 DomiKo: ehhh after reading some PMs I'm really sad that I didn't have much time&#160;:(
 jacek: they should have announced it earlier. everyone gave up hope about cg contests
 eulerscheZahl: or announce it at the time they did but start it later
 eulerscheZahl: less bugs
 Westicles: I still have no idea what green IT means

 jacek: by training NNs on coal energy
 struct: how much time has your NN spent training?
 Westicles: oh, so that's why the phones are used, I get it
 eulerscheZahl: a concept new to americans?
 struct: also does your last NN handle trask prio BONUS for other?
 Kellthazar: hahahaha
 jacek: it was mostly fiddling with hyperparameters, now i can train the one I had in few hours
 jacek: what task prio bonus?
 Westicles: you wouldn't call it green here, bad associations with greenpeace
 eulerscheZahl: the missing legal action
 struct: the one that wasnt given in legal moves
 jacek: oh, no
 DomiKo: ohh boy
 jacek: was it important?
 DomiKo: jacek top1 incoming
 struct: its the difference between rank 10 and rank 1
 jacek: can you share a replay when they use it?
 eulerscheZahl: i feel like jacek got top10 without even trying to rank high as a primary objective
 Kellthazar: Vim 9.0 released... o.o
 jacek: well im happy i reached legend
 jacek: refurbished phone would be a bonus. but all i want is refurbished t-shirt
 eulerscheZahl: no tshirts this contest
 jacek:&#160;:(

 eulerscheZahl: in the terms of defining 4 different variables A,B,C,D for the witch contest instead of an array[4]
 eulerscheZahl: i shared it here, but blurred the username for anonymity
 eulerscheZahl: then the user shared the same snippet in the post mortem
 jacek: 729?
 struct: its a game you never played jacek
 struct: Maybe a NN could work there idk
 eulerscheZahl: 3**6STC, possible layouts in the top 2 rows
 eulerscheZahl: to look up valid moves
 struct: before I had 4096 if it includes illegal states
 20220628: LOL this interface is shit
 eulerscheZahl: your feedback too
 20220628: so u agree cos u attack me
 Kellthazar:&#160;?
 struct: can't argue with this logic
 eulerscheZahl: no. my point is: you say it's shit without giving any reasoning
 20220628: right then here it is 
 20220628: i say print print print i get nothing
 20220628: regular code in regular work I get answer answer answer. stonks up
 darkhorse64: The sad conclusion of the contest is that the best is to release as early as possible with lots of technical debts :thinking:
 20220628: here stonks none
 struct: I only released starting at turn 5 I think
 eulerscheZahl: games could have been a bit longer
 Kellthazar: darkhorse64, oh, the irony! XD
 eulerscheZahl: with more apps and/or higher costs per app you would have to be more careful
 eulerscheZahl: and CI would be even stronger&#160;:/
 struct: could you start the game with 4 debth?
 20220628: "¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
 Nerchio: i think referee blocks that
 Nerchio: but dont quote me on that
 struct: Yeah I never saw it
 darkhorse64: es
 darkhorse64: yes
 struct: you could?
 darkhorse64: sorry, 4 debts or 4 bonus is disallowed by the referee
 struct: ah ok
 struct: thanks
 struct: I guess player 1 would just move to task_prio if it happened
 struct: since CI would be useless in that turn
 darkhorse64: That said, software delivery IRL is like that
 struct: not task, daily sorry
 OldJohn: Hi, is there a link of this chat archive&#160;?
 Wishbone: This is an interesting chat to follow. I have absolutely no idea what any of you are talking about, but much of it sounds intriguing&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?limit=50&amp;days=7&amp;enhanced=1&amp;urlversion=2">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?limit=50&amp;days=7&amp;enhanced=1&amp;urlversion=2</a>
 struct: We are talking about the previous contest Wishbone
 OldJohn: Thanks Euler.
 OldJohn: (BTW I never thank Euler enough fot beginning the graph theory&#160;!)
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: the king had to cross all the bridges after all
 Wishbone: Thanks struct, that gives a bit of context at least. Don't know much about it since I only joined yesterday.
 Wishbone: Joined the site, that is.
 jacek: its general chat, not only mad pod racing
 Wishbone: Is THIS pod racing?&#160;:-D
 jacek: no, pod racing is quite old contest ~
 eulerscheZahl: one day you will show up and see no chat. then you can find some of us on discord
 Kellthazar: Is "Coders Strikes Back" the best contest ever made here?
 Wishbone: Yeah, just joined the Discord. I actually thought this was one of the Discord channels, but that appears not to be the case.
 eulerscheZahl: opinions differ on the best game
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's hypersonic and code of ice and fire
 Nerchio:  code of ice and fire was pretty fun
 darkhorse64: crystal rush is one of my favorites
 eulerscheZahl: i hate fog
 darkhorse64: fog is quite light in this game
 OldJohn: Othello is my favorite&#160;:-)
 darkhorse64: for boardgames, yavalath
 Kellthazar: The pacman contest was really nice.
 OldJohn: My program is like me, now&#160;! Do not know what to play after the opening book. 
 struct: just book until the end :D
 jacek: i dont know how to play othello. i would struggle to get legal moves on real board
 OldJohn: I know a line I play as black that I know till the 31-33 end
 OldJohn: Only once on Internet White played it correctly.. I suppose it was using a program
 jacek: you need to counterbook nyanyan
 jacek: you are our only hope
 OldJohn: Let see what it plays&#160;:-)
 OldJohn: With white it plays a draw line... My program does not find the draw after the book but I know it is there. And same as black&#160;!
 struct: is the game solved?
 OldJohn: No, but this line is 
 struct: not even weakly solved?
 struct: oh it isnt
 OldJohn: As far as know it is not
 sqrtNOT: I keep getting captchas on clash of code :cry:

 Darleanow: Hello, what's Euler's website&#160;?
 Darleanow: i'm looking for clashes database
 5DN1L: it's down at the moment
 5DN1L: i guess it'll be up again on 1 July
 Darleanow: okay thank you sir&#160;!!&#160;:)
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: euler's gonna have to start charging for use of that to keep the dynos flowing
 OldJohn: Ok, as expected my program plays a losing move out of book&#160;!  And Zebra program knows the line well&#160;!
 FoxHound1935: Im new to coding, is it good site to learn it?
 5DN1L: this is a good site for practising
 5DN1L: for new learners,tTry codecademy.com , 'The Coding Train' on youtube, or first levels in codewars.com
 5DN1L: try*
 FoxHound1935: Okey, I will try those. Thank you very much
 OldJohn: Correction as black it plays a bad line at move 31
 Wishbone: From what I've seen so far, this is probably not the best place to start if you don't already know SOME programming.
 Astrobytes: Oldjohn: not sure there's enough time on CG to manage to find all those draw lines, or indeed enough space to book even some of all possible draw lines discovered so far&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *manage to find many of
 OldJohn: A good program should be able to play them
 jacek: boumagik any question?
 Astrobytes: Room to improve then, fix it! as we say here
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 boumagik: jacek I'm looking to improve my score at 2048. I feel like i should be pruning during the beam search (currently not). Any pointer&#160;?
 jacek: oh, i just brute force minimax
 jacek: what is your score function
 jacek: i have the snake-like
 boumagik: I'm on a beam search algo, so it's going through the tree of possibilities while selecting a beam of best states at each iteration
 Uljahn: i use beamsearch with 3 actions and remove duplicate states from the beam, also snake-shaped score
 Astrobytes: but how are you evaluating the states boumagik? Score only or snake?
 boumagik: score only, I don't even know what you mean by snake
 boumagik: I suppose this is the pointer I'm looking for
 Astrobytes: snake is like an optimum values version of the grid. So there is a score for each line in the 'snake'
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sqpbc.png">https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sqpbc.png</a>
 Astrobytes: thank you jacek, much easier to visualise with a visual&#160;:)
 boumagik: thanks for the visual
 Wishbone: Small victory: just did Death First Search - Episode 1. It ran (correctly even) on the first try&#160;:-D It's probably horribly inefficient but it works, and it's a far cry from the sort of things I deal with in my work.
 boumagik: how did you end up figuring out the snake&#160;?
 Astrobytes: nice one Wishbone&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: have you played 2048 yourself? this is something what people come up with
 jacek: to get highest value in the corner
 darkhorse64: if you play the game, you find out 
 Astrobytes: most people have their own version but it follows roughly the same pattern
 Wishbone: I haven't worked with graphs since... Uhm, that would be 2001, I think.
 Wishbone: And that wasn't even work, that was education.
 boumagik: thanks all
 boumagik: did the snake make for a big improvement once you implemented it&#160;?
 jacek: for me it was much better than score only
 Astrobytes: before I came to CG my graph theory was limited to simple trees only Wishbone&#160;:)
 Wishbone: Astrobytes: Yeah, I came here looking for just a few fun coding challenges, but I'm actually also learning stuff. It's great&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I've learned a ton on here that I wouldn't have otherwise, CS-wise or otherwise mathematical
 Wishbone: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ed4e1d1-b477-4c05-ad35-7a0fdb94c2fd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ed4e1d1-b477-4c05-ad35-7a0fdb94c2fd</a>
 Wishbone: Huh, TIL, if you type too long a message in the chat, it goes to pastebin automatically.
 Wishbone: Or, well, it makes a pastebin link which doesn't work...
 Astrobytes: It normally works but been broken for a few weeks or so
 Uljahn: at least the chat still does
 Astrobytes: So true Uljahn
 Wishbone: Short sentences then&#160;:-/
 Astrobytes: No, I think it works on line breaks?
 Uljahn: 4 or more newlines i guess
 Wishbone: tl;dr; I think it's interesting to see other people's solutions after you've solved a puzzle.
 Astrobytes: For sure.
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: I only have a day left.. I need some Approvals.... anyone, anyone&#160;???

 Astrobytes: Lisa-Has-Ideas: it's quite normal for the approval to take longer, you can republish as soon as it expires
 Astrobytes: and FWIW it looks clashable
 Astrobytes: don't see why people forced it into easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: anyway, gn all
 BugKiller_328: hi, guys. I have a question about minimax
 struct: gn
 struct: yes BugKiller_328?
 BugKiller_328: when I make the connect4 AI with minimax
 BugKiller_328: in the early stage, we have so many possibilities, so can't go deep
 BugKiller_328: but later, board is filled, I think minimax can go more depth
 BugKiller_328: how can I decide the depth in this kind of situation?
 BugKiller_328: I hope my question make sense to understand.
 struct: like when to start using minimax?
 struct: or the depth you want to search?
 BugKiller_328: yes.
 BugKiller_328: if board is almost empty I think we can't go too much depth
 BugKiller_328: but later, (game goes by), I can go more depth 
 BugKiller_328: Am I right?
 struct: yeah end games should be fsater
 struct: faster*
 struct: but your idea is to switch between to searches?
 struct: one for early and one for late?
 BugKiller_328: yes. my idea is to use different depth for minimax
 struct: ah look iterative deepening
 struct: its probably what you are looking for
 struct: you will search while you have time with it
 BugKiller_328: Thank you for guiding me this keyword.&#160;:)
 BugKiller_328: I'll try to learn about it.&#160;:) Thanks
 struct: np
 Aldoggen: hey, for some reason codingame thinks I speak french (half of my country speaks it, the other half, including me speaks dutch). any idea how to get rid of the french chat?
 Adam9910: get rid of all the french
 Aldoggen: bit too much effort. was looking for something I could accomplish tomorrow
 Aldoggen: without nukes
 struct: Not sure you can close it
 Aldoggen: there's no cross
 struct: It joins you based on your country flag
 Adam9910: when you have open any game you have settings in the left panel
 Aldoggen: I tried to look in the settings some time ago, didn't find anything useful yet
 Adam9910: i see language there
 Aldoggen: it lets me switch between english and french in that panel lmao
 Aldoggen: thanks for the suggestions though
 boumagik: thanks jacek Uljahn and others, I'm pulling 20m+ on 2048 now. Need to fix timeout on couple of games
 Aldoggen: whoa
 Aldoggen: gj
 struct: nice
 Bob_Rocks: What are the maximum values for the amount of cyborgs at a factory on turn one of Ghost In the Cell/Cyborg Uprising
 Aldoggen: at least 0
 Bob_Rocks: the maximum values
 Aldoggen: yeah sorry I was just trolling
 Bob_Rocks: very funny 
 Aldoggen: I just joined cyborg uprising to go have a look. for the player, it's 15-30.
 Aldoggen: I assume it must be the same for other players too, because that's only fair
 Aldoggen: so max would be 30?
 Bob_Rocks: But the minimum is 0 I believe
 Bob_Rocks: Oh I guess I should've specifiede
 Bob_Rocks: I meant specifically any factory
 Bob_Rocks: but I guess the max would be 30 for any factory?
 Aldoggen: for neutral ones I see 0 3 and 13
 Bob_Rocks: I thought I saw 28 once
 Aldoggen: I can reroll a bit
 Aldoggen: I guess the max wouldn't be very useful to know no? it's the neutrals with the minimum you need to take first
 Aldoggen: idk
 Aldoggen: but 30 would probably be a good guess
 Bob_Rocks: okay
 Aldoggen: thanks for showing me this bot problem btw, I like this one
 Bob_Rocks: lol you're welcome I guess
 Aldoggen: I played so many flash games like this
 Aldoggen: awesome
 Bob_Rocks: well I absolutely suck at it 
 Aldoggen: as long as the bot wins it's fine lol
 Bob_Rocks: I'm bad at the game and my bot is also bad at the game lol
 Aldoggen: XD
 Aldoggen: did you read jaceks report on the last contest?
 Aldoggen: he made a neural network 
 Aldoggen: never knew the rules himself
 Aldoggen: and the bot got pretty high
 Aldoggen: maybe won. I forgot
 Bob_Rocks: I have not read it
 Bob_Rocks: but personally I don't really want to win 
 Bob_Rocks: I just wanna learn something cause I suck at programming these things 
 Aldoggen: fair enough&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: what language are you ussing?
 Bob_Rocks: I'm using Python
 Aldoggen: solid choice
 Bob_Rocks: I've recently been trying to learn some game and control theory to get a good algorithm with finite state machines or with some function that's generated at the start of the game and then matched
 Bob_Rocks: I was also planning on getting some of my friends to work on this too but they only know Lua and I'm not programming this bot in lua
 Aldoggen: yeah, I wouldn't like to do it in lua either
 Aldoggen: I'm gonna be fair, I know some of those words, and seems like it'd be pretty hard to do something like that
 Aldoggen: like, I wouldn't know what a good cost function would be for something like this
 Bob_Rocks: Me neither but there algorithms that show you candidates for cost functions 
 Bob_Rocks: its like taking dynamics and then plugging it into an inverse lagrangian
 Aldoggen: okay, that's too much physics&#160;:)
 Bob_Rocks: I can't think of a better way to do it besides like minmax or some other changing function method in some wayLike the function is a piecewise where if you enter certain states in the game it enters a possibly discontinuous state in the function
 Bob_Rocks: TLDR a fininte state machine 
 Aldoggen: well, maybe not too much, but I've never seen things like lagrangians. I've done math tho if you want to vent
 Bob_Rocks: I **would** say something like lagrangians are just energy functions (which they kind of are but it's not like a hamiltonian where it's the total energy)
 Aldoggen: energy of a system?
 Bob_Rocks: Yes the energy of a system
 Aldoggen: and I'm assuming we're talking kinematics here, so no chemical potential energy and all that stuff
 Bob_Rocks: No that's allowed 
 Aldoggen: oh wow
 Bob_Rocks: L (the lagrangian density) = T - UKinetic energy - potential energy
 Bob_Rocks: So gravitational, chemical, spring, whatever
 DollarAkshay: #Denmark
 Aldoggen: all right&#160;:)
 Bob_Rocks: but anyway, I can't think of a better way to make something
 Bob_Rocks: other than an ever changing finite state machine 
 Aldoggen: minmax sounds good tho
 Bob_Rocks: I hate using min max
 Aldoggen: yeah I would too
 Bob_Rocks: it makes me feel like I'm so inept that I can't bother to make a better solution than minmax
 Aldoggen: I have been able to avoid it until now
 Bob_Rocks: I'd rather use some simplified form of minmax where the initial future states are calculated about 1 or 2 steps in advance 
 Bob_Rocks: and then I do some analysis based on that instead of using the remaining time per frame computing the rest of the states
 Aldoggen: 2 states sounds like not a lot tho
 Aldoggen: but minmax + some kind of eval sounds like the way to go
 Bob_Rocks: I agree so maybe I'd say like 10 states
 Aldoggen: yeah, sounds more like it
 Kellthazar: I like minimax with alphaBeta... its so clever.
 Aldoggen: I'm just gonna do what I always do and try to identify problems from gameplay. ad hoc solutions, here I come!
 Bob_Rocks: yeah that's what I was thinking but it still makes me feel stupid lol
 Aldoggen: because you're walking the paved path
 Bob_Rocks: what do you mean 
 Aldoggen: standing on the shoulders of giants
 Aldoggen: doing the things a lot of people have done
 Aldoggen: well maybe not exactly that, but idk
 Bob_Rocks: lol
 Bob_Rocks: My idea now is to try and create a simulation of the game that I can step through and try to beat an algorithm that's pretty good at beating a novice
 Bob_Rocks: specifically stepping through and giving commands 
 Bob_Rocks: then I can see what strategies that I come up with during the game
 Bob_Rocks: so that I can implement those control states during the algorithm
 Aldoggen: I do some of that too&#160;:) in the mad pod racing I just added heuristic after heuristic
 Aldoggen: here I plan to do the same
 Aldoggen: but remind me to go to bed soon, I live in europe. it's 2 am here XD
 Bob_Rocks: oh lmao
 Bob_Rocks: well yeah you should go to bed 2am programming is probably not good for you
 Aldoggen: morning-me is gonna be glad if I do that, but now-me says I need to finish this small thing first
 Bob_Rocks: well it is what it is
 Bob_Rocks: wait a minute
 Bob_Rocks: for the neutral factories there is a larger chance for factories to be 0 than any other number
 Bob_Rocks: at least that's what it feels like
 Aldoggen: yep
 Bob_Rocks: but I wonder what the chance is specifically
 Bob_Rocks: well I can compute it but I"m not sure I want to
 Aldoggen: I'd say at least half of them are
 Bob_Rocks: I coudl just run the code that does nothing for the first frame and then basically deconstruct all the probabilities for every number 
 Aldoggen: but I havent seen much
 Aldoggen: yeah&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: takes some time tho
 Aldoggen: and it might change in higher leagues
 Aldoggen: but most important thing is just to decide and start doing something&#160;:)
 Bob_Rocks: well I'm just gonna start reverse engineering the probabilities in the game 
 Kellthazar: are you talking about the pod racing game?
 Aldoggen: I was briefly
 Bob_Rocks: Cyborg Uprising / Ghost in The Cell
 Aldoggen: now it's back to cyborg uprising
 Bob_Rocks: For pod racing I think I'll have to reverse engineer the thrust physics 
 Bob_Rocks: if I can get a set of equations then I can at least look at them and maybe find something
 Aldoggen: most of the rules (like turn speed) are specified once you get higher leagues
 Bob_Rocks: Bruh come on 
 Aldoggen: XD
 Aldoggen: yeah, I found it a bit offputting too
 Bob_Rocks: Litearlly gatekeeping my simulation making
 Aldoggen: you don't need a very good bot to get out of wood tho
 Aldoggen: bronze was a breeze too
 Bob_Rocks: for pod racing?
 Aldoggen: silver took some work
 Aldoggen: yep
 Bob_Rocks: Bruh 
 Bob_Rocks: well I haven't tried it in about 2 years
 Bob_Rocks: I couldn't get out of wood 2 years ago
 Aldoggen: oof
 Bob_Rocks: but at least I'm bronze in Cyborg Uprising from my 900 lines of C# that I wrote like a year ago
 Aldoggen: XD
 Bob_Rocks: half the code was documentation
 Bob_Rocks: and yet I still dont understand what it does to this day
 Aldoggen: that's hilarious :D
 Aldoggen: mfs in bot games be like: "if I don't know what I'm doing, you sure as hell don't know what I'm doing"
 Bob_Rocks: lol
 Julian_Dixon: if
 Julian_Dixon:         if
 Julian_Dixon: this is ai
 Julian_Dixon: love it
 Bob_Rocks: Automaton2000 is this ai
 Automaton2000: oh, i got it&#160;:)
 Bob_Rocks: Automaton2000 answer the question is this ai
 Automaton2000: and when i need to finish my bot
 Bob_Rocks: well it is what it is
 Aldoggen: all right, I'm heading to bed
 Crosility: The code must go on.
 HenroLST: smh not coding in your sleep during forcefully induced lucid dreaming?
 Naya08: im so lost
 Naya08: im new at this
 Crosility: Are you asking for help Naya08, or where to begin?
 Naya08: help
 Crosility: What do you need help with?
 Crosility: A puzzle, programming, starting, .. what's your goal?
 HenroLST: for c++, if i wanted to find the value of the first element in a vector that fits a certain criteria, what would i do? just iterate through the whole vector in a for loop?
 Crosility: You're asking about search criteria?
 Crosility: That's one method, if your vector is small enough.
 Crosility: If it's unsorted, then yes, 1 by 1 search till a criteria matches is the best case.
 HenroLST: yeah, I was just wondering if theres another method, such as similar to std::find or std:: find_first_of
 Crosility: No, essentially that functionality is the same as just implementing a basic loop, and going through the vector/list.
 HenroLST: ok, thanks
 Crosility: But, apparently there is the algorithm library.
 Crosility: That does it.
 Crosility: So, I'm wrong.
 Crosility: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/571394/how-to-find-out-if-an-item-is-present-in-a-stdvector">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/571394/how-to-find-out-if-an-item-is-present-in-a-stdvector</a>
 Crosility: It does the for loop for you.
 HenroLST: nope your right i think, it doesnt return a iterator or integer value, its a binary expression i beleive
 HenroLST: oh wait nvm it does return a iterator
 HenroLST: thanks!
 Crosility: Sorry I was wrong at first, been a few years since I used C++, forgot about algorithm library. :P You're welcome.
 Zaos: yo
 Zaos: is there anyway to head back into a clash of code
 Zaos: like I wanted to finish my code but the timer ran out
 HenroLST: thanks! finally solved the spoons after realizing it was not just literally next index :sweat_smile:
 HenroLST: zaos, i dont think there is
 HenroLST: however using the coc chat you can ask others still doing for test cases and the problem
 Zaos: damn that sucks, I really wanted to figure that out
 HenroLST: do you remember the problem?
 Zaos: Yea I took a pic of it
 HenroLST: you can go to another IDE to try
 HenroLST: i mostly use USACO's free IDE under resources in USACO guide
 HenroLST: actually depends on language
 Zaos: i am probably going to usle idle
 Zaos: for python
 HenroLST: USACO only for python and C++ and Java i think
 Zaos: Thanks
 Zaos: figured it out

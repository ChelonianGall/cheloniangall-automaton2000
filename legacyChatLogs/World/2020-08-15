 jacek: happy Caturday
 Gorbit99: happy caturday
 a1b8r: What are cps in this game?
 JBM: CPS?
 a1b8r: CP
 a1b8r: CPS being plural
 a1b8r: Codin Points
 WINWINWIN: points gained by competitive programming on codingame that determine your global rang
 WINWINWIN: You can see the full explanation if you click on your rank at the home page and then the&#160;? next to codinpoints
 Gorbit99: it's explained under your profile &gt; click on your rank
 a1b8r: Thank you!
 FatherMucker: hey whats the best solution for this game guys?
 winterc4t: bro
 a1b8r: They aren't increasing tho, if I'm playing.
 aCat: they are updated once per day
 aCat: so you don't see rightaway ranking change
 aCat: if that's what you mean
 a1b8r: thank you! 
 a1b8r: understood
 winterc4t: :rage:
 Foxyy: henlo
 Foxyy: Hiiiiiiiii
 Foxyy: how r u
 Foxyy: me gud
 winterc4t: nope
 winterc4t: hahaHA
 Kiripot: lol
 AntiSquid: good morning, no spam please, thanks

 jrke: happy caturday&#160;:)
 Thyl: Hello&#160;!
 Thyl: Do you know any articles on genetic algorithms&#160;?
 Phenomz: how come im able to program some stuff but im unable to solve those fucking puzzles.. making me mad -_-
 Tee-Resa: what puzzle?
 Phenomz: im just trying "Chuck norris" a beginner puzzle lol
 Thyl: *please&#160;?
 Phenomz: maybe im just too dumb to understand the examples of those puzzles... well im certain
 eulerscheZahl: don't you understand how to approach it or how to put your thoughts into code?
 Phenomz: maybe just put my thoughts into those example would be more accurate idk
 Phenomz: it says "we want to encode the message CC" but the expected results is: 0 0 00 0000 0 00&#160;?
 Phenomz: and the base message is C?
 eulerscheZahl: so, the first step is to convert CC into binary in respect to the ASCII table
 eulerscheZahl: 10000111000011
 Phenomz: so i can just take the whole alphabet and make it convert into ASCII binary?
 Phenomz: that's it?
 eulerscheZahl: then group it:10000111 ...
 eulerscheZahl: and convert as specified:1 =&gt; 0 00000 =&gt; 00 0000111 =&gt; 0 000
 Tee-Resa: in binary there is only the first step, you should then display the sequences of 0 and 1 differently
 Phenomz: alright, i'll try something
 Phenomz: thanks
 Tee-Resa: try to write down what order you have and what should happen there. mostly helps
 Phenomz: how is C coded as&#160;: 0 0 00 0000 0 00 if it gives 1000011 as binary
 Phenomz: wtf.
 eulerscheZahl: take the 1000011 and group it into same digits
 eulerscheZahl: 1000011
 Phenomz:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: is that not clear?
 Phenomz: well i thought i had to convert it which i did.. but im lost
 eulerscheZahl: that binary conversion is just the first step
 eulerscheZahl: you did the well but there's more to do for the puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: a sequence of 1 gets converted to0 &lt;length of sequence&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: thus: 1 =&gt; 0 011 =&gt; 0 00
 eulerscheZahl: and a group of 0's: 00 &lt;length&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: 0000 =&gt; 00 0000
 eulerscheZahl: put that in order:0 0 00 0000 0 00
 eulerscheZahl: and that's the conversion of "C"
 Phenomz: ah i see
 Gorbit99: I blcoked madknight on discord yesterday&#160;:(
 Gorbit99: he messaged me 3 times a day if i tried the algo he outlined the other day, and yesterday when I told him that I had other plans, he said to just not do that and do the algo instead, as what I wanted sucked anyways
 wlesavo: thats a classic mad
 eulerscheZahl: wow, he's still active?
 Phenomz: @eulerscheZahl
 wlesavo: also surprised
 wlesavo: is the SG competition over euler?
 eulerscheZahl: there has never been one
 wlesavo: i mean that illedan challenge
 eulerscheZahl: tomorrow evening i think
 wlesavo: oh i see
 Gorbit99: eulerscheZahl I was code golfing a different thing on a discord server, and he told me, that I should make the algo instead of the stupid code golf, and also that I should look at you because you're the best coder and you hate coc too
 Gorbit99: sorry, he said you know tons about programming to be exact
 eulerscheZahl: how dare you enjoying something that god-like eulerscheZahl dislikes? :D
 eulerscheZahl: you should upload 3D teapots instead
 MSmits: Gorbit99 wise words, I look at euler all the time
 MSmits: that's how you beat him, just make him uncomfortable
 dbdr: Glory To Eulerschezka!
 kovi: how westicles still ahead?
 AntiSquid: Gorbit99 do what you like, even coc if that's what you want, someone hating something doesn't make them right, if you apply a filter based on other people's preference you might as well quit CG: see recurz
 MSmits: kovi i have a list of maximum found scores from papers and from that human playable website, Westicles is very near the max
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/88ItxTW">https://imgur.com/a/88ItxTW</a>
 Westicles: aCat says he knows an unpublished paper that beats them all.  I guess neural nets?
 aCat: no
 aCat: yet another RPNI
 aCat: by Tristan
 AntiSquid: who's paper would it be? aCat's&#160;?
 AntiSquid: regenerative peripheral nerve interface&#160;? 
 dbdr: could you share those numbers as text MSmits?
 MSmits: sure, sec
 Westicles: I only know Ed's approach (spurious_ai), he just did BFS.  
 dbdr: ‏I had this from the js website: ‫‏‎88214
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a6012afb-4214-4481-88c3-af48e28eb2fe">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a6012afb-4214-4481-88c3-af48e28eb2fe</a>
 MSmits: yes some scores are best from js website, some scores are higher in papers
 dbdr: lol: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/D4qBgA.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/D4qBgA.jpg</a>
 MSmits: apparently humans are still better at some
 dbdr: js site might not be all human
 jrke: suppose if i see all possible outcomes in offline ide then&#160;?
 MSmits: true probably not
 aCat: damn me
 aCat: NRPA&#160;;]
 aCat: too many shorcuts
 aCat: wait
 aCat: I have to check this one alse
 dbdr: jrke: that would take longer than the age of the universe
 kovi: so the best way to win to get some strong players play this 20?&#160;:)
 aCat: nested rollout policy adaptation\
 jrke: really? dbdr
 dbdr: yes
 aCat: with some tweaks
 kovi: i was thinking about that. with not good enough algo manual could help with ns
 kovi: (below 100)
 MSmits: in other worse, doing what jrke says also solves the problem of finding out how the universe ends
 dbdr: "Exponential growth is the most powerful force in the universe"
 MSmits: words that is
 jrke: max possible outcomes will be less than 115**115 its uncountable
 MSmits: you just counted it
 MSmits: and its even less than you said
 kovi: yay
 jrke: yup!!
 dbdr: the word is untractable
 kovi: trictrac is offline?
 MSmits: doesn't this game have a lot of transpositions also?
 dbdr: even less? lame! :D
 dbdr: it's still NP complete
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: but there's some improvement there
 dbdr: sure
 MSmits: I am not taking this into account currently
 MSmits: are you?
 dbdr: yes, zobrist
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: it's difficult to do for mcts
 MSmits: but meta mcts handles it just fine if i ever get it finished
 Westicles: MSmits, your table has 6086 for case9.  Where is that from?
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/KNOSYS_SameGame.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/KNOSYS_SameGame.pdf</a>
 MSmits: page 18
 MSmits: HGSTS score
 MSmits: I think they use the GPU
 MSmits: they dont have highest on everything btew
 MSmits: btw
 dbdr: looks like 50+% are from the JS site
 dbdr: thanks for the numbers MSmits!
 MSmits: sure, but also some of the js numbers are submitted from bots
 MSmits: so some might be in both
 MSmits: np
 dbdr: I do the same of calculating the diff to max to know where most improvement might lie&#160;:)
 Westicles: Man, that's over a thousand over me.  Better try that one some more
 MSmits: yeah
 Westicles: I bet its a typo, though
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/2YgZPr.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/2YgZPr.jpg</a>this seems old :D
 MSmits: it's just highly compatible
 dbdr: with 90's browsers
 MSmits: yeha
 dbdr: "Monte Carlo (MC)tree search algorithms are a form of best-first search algorithms that do not evaluate the quality of a node based on some evaluation function. Instead, Monte Carlo bases the quality of a node on a number of random games"
 dbdr: except you can consider the score on random games as the (randomized) evaluation function
 MSmits: yes, but the base MC is used for win/loss games 
 MSmits: with -1 to 1 scores
 dbdr: that's a special case
 MSmits: also the evaluation function is supposed to be an approximation of the board value
 MSmits: the score is the actual board value
 dbdr: you don't do -1/1, you use the final score
 MSmits: right but for win/loss games -1 to 1 are the actual game results
 MSmits: for samegame the score is the actual game result
 dbdr: for specific actions
 MSmits: yes but thats always true for a statistical search
 dbdr: it's just one more evaluation function
 MSmits: i dont agree, when you make an evaluation for chess, or checkers or whatnot, you dont have win/loss scores, you evaluate other things
 MSmits: you dont evaluate the end of the game 
 dbdr: you can do that or do something else
 MSmits: in same game you do evaluate the end of the game, doesnt matter that it is random and dependent on actions
 dbdr: there are all evaluation functions
 dbdr: *they
 dbdr: you could say "static heuristic evaluation"
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr i don't even recognize the red browser icon from your screenshot
 MSmits: do you still call it an evaluation function if the game is solved and you're just taking the solved result?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: me neither. sherlock time&#160;:)
 dbdr: MSmits: yes, I would
 dbdr: it's perfect evaluation&#160;:)
 Westicles: MSmits, I'm not sure about that paper.  I beat him in most cases, but he beats me by 1002 and 1003 in two cases.  
 MSmits: ah ok, fi that is your definition, then basic mcts uses an evaluation function as well
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/images/browser_mozilla.gif">http://www.js-games.de/images/browser_mozilla.gif</a>
 dbdr: so it's "mozilla"
 MSmits: Westicles your heuristics may have a blind spot
 MSmits: and so do his
 dbdr: ah yes, if I zoom I see the godzilla head&#160;:)
 SuthiwatPraesi: yo mates
 Westicles: Nah, I think he is giving himself 2000 to clear&#160;:)
 dbdr: there was a time where they were saying "it's written Nescape but it's pronounced Mozilla" or sth like that
 dbdr: oh, you can do that? :innocent:
 MSmits: Westicles lol ok, who knows&#160;:) It is said in the paper that the results are unverfied
 SuthiwatPraesi: I have a question
 MSmits: for that particular AI
 dbdr: can I tell the referee how much I want for clearing?
 SuthiwatPraesi: How long it take to be professional at CP
 MSmits: coding points?
 SuthiwatPraesi: Competitive Programming
 MSmits: might be a long time, still not making money off of it&#160;:(
 MSmits: oh ok
 dbdr: 3 years and 2 months
 MSmits: oddly specific
 dbdr: well, that's a hint&#160;:)
 SuthiwatPraesi: for real
 dbdr: suddenly, poof! you're competitive
 Westicles: Also, seems weird he took the time to type his two 78k results into jsgames, but didn't bother with the much better  85k score
 dbdr: SuthiwatPraesi: you get better over time, that's all. there is no specific time
 MSmits: Westicles let me put it this way, your result for 9 is  like 5k right?
 eulerscheZahl: what does that even mean, being a professional at it? doing it for a living?
 Westicles: yep
 MSmits: my result for 9 is 4631
 MSmits: everywhere i have around 75-85% of max
 MSmits: if 6k would not be the max
 SuthiwatPraesi: Thanks guys
 MSmits: but 5k
 MSmits: then i would have over 90% of max in case 9
 MSmits: it would be my best result suddenly
 MSmits: by far
 MSmits: so I imagine the max must be higher than yours
 MSmits: using the same kind of logic as you are
 Westicles: MSmits, but why would he take the time to manually play in his two lesser results into jsgames (as unimaas2 and 3), but not the much higher one?  Plus all us other guys are grouped tight around a different number.  
 MSmits: you are saying, my bot rocks, it can't be that high. I am saying, my bot sucks, so it cant be that low
 dbdr: it can happen that there is a narrow path to make a bigger main group
 Westicles: If you know that guy, you should track him down and make him confess&#160;:)
 MSmits: no idea Westicles, but while repeatedly running my mcts, I can suddenly jump up 600 points
 dbdr: N² grows fast
 eulerscheZahl: my bot completely clears 19 out of 20 boards. and somehow misses on. just some strange case where my search fails hard
 MSmits: which case cant you clear and what is your score there?
 eulerscheZahl: 19: 3337
 kovi: btw 120 is reachable online
 eulerscheZahl: just arguing about Westicles having a lower score
 kovi: 120k
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible to have some blind spot
 MSmits: got 3989, must have cleared it
 eulerscheZahl: that's pretty impressive kovi
 MSmits: I think you are converging on a result thats not cleared, my score without the +1000 is 2989 so you got further on scores for regions
 MSmits: might be it's just missing the reward at the far end of the tree
 MSmits: beaming does that
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 dbdr:  Until the year 2010, the top score on this setwas 84,414 points, held by the programspurious ai.5This program applies amethod called Simple Breadth Search (SBS), which uses beam search, multipleprocessors and a large amount of memory (cf.  Takes and Kosters, 2009).  Fur-ther details about this program are not known.
 MSmits: say you also have a result that will get 2989 without the bonus. It will be dropped out of the beam in favor of your 3337
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl maybe keep some random bad scores?
 dbdr: there can be the same issue in MCTS if you stop exploring a branch
 MSmits: sure but that can be solved with more cpu time
 eulerscheZahl: nah, doing my own nonsense approach right now MSmits
 dbdr: and more memory. in beam search too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and tbh i'm not too involved into the game
 MSmits: yeah dbdr, thats why meta mcts might be great here
 MSmits: pleny of HD space available
 MSmits: also currently I am losing everything when i reset my search
 dbdr: going for the world record?
 dbdr: the thing is, this problem seems to be researched to death
 MSmits: i doubt it, but I like running meta mcts, it's fun. I'll get as far as I get
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to contest top scores on a poorly analyzed subject, just put it on codingame :D
 dbdr: ^
 dbdr: I have several world records that way :D
 MSmits: you do
 dbdr: "world"
 eulerscheZahl: but did you write a paper?
 MSmits: yes it doesnt count unless there's a paper
 dbdr: yes. but not about those&#160;;)
 MSmits: give us your secrets
 dbdr: obstination is the secret. you know it&#160;;)
 MSmits: I'll request them from research gate
 jacek: for $$$
 MSmits: obstipation?
 dbdr:&#160;?
 MSmits: heh constipated in Dutch.
 Westicles: spurious_ai is Ed Mertensotto.  He worked on this for years, and everybody kept writing papers saying they had no idea who he is
 dbdr: let your ideas out
 MSmits: Westicles did you work on this before acat put it up?
 MSmits: you seemed to have a good bot so quickly
 eulerscheZahl: he did in 2012
 MSmits: oh
 Westicles: MSmits, yes I am sampson on jsgames
 MSmits: ahhhh
 MSmits: can illedan maybe extend the deadline another 8 years please
 dbdr: hypermarathon
 Westicles: Well, I only worked on it 2 months, so you can have that long
 dbdr: Westicles: you found your code but not your data, right?
 MSmits: wow 2 months, that's still pretty hardcore. 
 Westicles: Yeah, but there are so many tuning params, they just shot straight back to the same answers, more or less
 dbdr: ah, you still had the params?
 dbdr: less than years for Mertensotto
 dbdr: but yes
 Westicles: Yeah, the code has like 10 params per test case.  
 wlesavo: MSmits or pirate dbdrs future article via scihub :smiley:
 MSmits: ohh right
 dbdr: why would I not make it public?
 MSmits: $
 dbdr: authors don't get paid
 wlesavo: well big journals make YOU pay for open access
 dbdr: ^
 dbdr: racket
 Sonex123: i dont understand it
 MSmits: you get exposure as a scientist, boosts your career
 MSmits: thats why
 wlesavo: there are some pure open access journal, lot of them, but not many people read them because of a flood of a junk papers
 dbdr: when you work in a field, you know who else is working on it
 dbdr: and what matters are the confs, where everyone can submit for free
 MSmits: since i signed up on ResearchGate, I keep getting "people read your work" mails. 
 dbdr: that's how you know about the research
 wlesavo: sure, also citating works good, people get notification aout beink cited
 MSmits: Turns out 2 people read my 16 year old paper last week :P
 MSmits: the only one I ever wrote
 JBM: read or downloaded?
 dbdr: might be "people"
 MSmits: not sure, hard to say
 dbdr: might be "read"
 dbdr: who knows
 MSmits: could be a bot
 MSmits: ofc
 MSmits: we all know automaton2000 is looking to branch out
 dbdr: reminds me of linkedin
 Automaton2000: yeah but i think it should be a lot better than my bot
 dbdr: "you are getting noticed" :D
 wlesavo: lol
 dbdr: it's the problem of those platforms, they have incentives to hook you, not to give you value
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: like every social media platform
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: well, the commercial ones
 MSmits: like every social media platform
 MSmits: well, 99%&#160;:)
 wlesavo: actually after todays disscussion testset becomes understandable, somehow it didnt come up to me that its actually standartised for benchmarking
 MSmits: yeah thats the nice part
 MSmits:  i was worried people would have put solutions online that you can hardcopy into your bot, but i didnt see any
 MSmits: probably if you look harder, you could find them somewhere
 MSmits: the owner of js-games could probably take the nr 1 spot :P
 dbdr: yes, maybe that's one that 85K is not there
 dbdr: *why
 MSmits: makes sense
 dbdr: I wonder if you could prove you have a solution without revealing it
 MSmits: doubt it
 dbdr: well, cryptography can do surprising things
 dbdr: you can prove you have a certain private key without revealing it
 JBM: seems feasible
 JBM: first one can just hash it
 dbdr: and then?
 MSmits: dbdr isnt that because the person you are revealing it to also has information others dont have?/
 JBM: depends on who he'd want to prove it to
 dbdr: sure, you can publish a hash to get the anteriority, if you later reveal it
 MSmits: meaning you can prove you had the solution earlier?
 dbdr: MSmits: no, that's the magic&#160;:)
 JBM: better "solutions" would need more framing
 dbdr: yes
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof</a>
 dbdr: MSmits: oversimplifying, you take huge prime numbers P and Q and publish R=P*Q. everyone knows R, but you can prove you know P and Q while it's "impossible" to find them based on R
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but you are communicating with someone
 eulerscheZahl: tried to submit a wrong score on the JS gaming site...
 dbdr: you can do it publicly
 eulerscheZahl: got a 200 OK response
 eulerscheZahl: content: "Cheater!"
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: they did good job
 JBM: classic
 dbdr: JBM style
 MSmits: dbdr what i mean is, you post something publicly, the person who can read it also has  P doesnt he?
 JBM: i remember trying this with colleagues as early as 2004
 MSmits: or Q or whatever
 Illedan: 123,550k, but only 95% 
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 JBM: and persistently keeping up with it each time a new popular game came up
 dbdr: you never reveal P and Q, those are private
 MSmits: but how does someone who is supposed to be able to read it, do so?
 dbdr: you can setup a channel with one person, yes
 MSmits: thats what i mean
 MSmits: so if you use something like this for samegame, someone has to have more information
 MSmits: there has to be some central agency to check
 dbdr: I'm not saying it's directly usable to prove you have a solution without revealing it
 dbdr: I'm saying it's not obvious what can be donne or not
 MSmits: ok, because the prime numbers thing is pretty much the only thing i know about this :P
 dbdr: before the invention of public key cryptography, it probably sounded impossible
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but dont you think a game has to be designed with this in mind?
 MSmits: i doubt you can figure this out afterwards
 JBM: it doesn't take too much to include it
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: that could be true
 JBM: you can get a lot of mileage out of just making a solution['s hash] a private key, and publicizing the public key
 JBM: get a solution =&gt; you can sign a "GOT IT" message for all to verify
 MSmits: hmm ok
 dbdr: what checks that the solution is valid?
 JBM: wait that's not that easy i'm getting ahead of myself
 JBM: game author presumably
 JBM: by stating what the public keys are
 dbdr: echo "GOT IT" | sign-it&#160;:)
 JBM: that's for single known-in-advance solution
 JBM: but some puzzles are constructed like that
 JBM: *cough* NS
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: yeah, that's an easier case
 JBM: i don't think there's a generic way for a generic puzzle
 dbdr: thinking of a referee program
 dbdr: if you can design sth around that it could be generic
 eulerscheZahl: and then the only thing you need is an interesting game using it
 xlr4829: Hello
 Osama_Almaani: i dont get it :joy:
 wlesavo: Westicles in that paper the rules are explicitly described to give 1000 points
 MSmits: he was kidding about the 2000
 MSmits: he just doesnt believe the high score and the score is not verified so who knows. By the way, these particular scores were not obtained by the author, but came from different scientists
 MSmits: i believe them, because every search has blind spots
 MSmits: (except full search)
 Westicles: Yeah, just kidding.  But it would be weird if case9 had such a solution.  It is so dominated by one color it is one of the easier ones
 wlesavo: oh sry, didnt get that :slight_smile:
 MSmits: but it is still far from solved and the fact that it's dominated by 1 color, means you can get a huge bonus just from adding a few more tiles to the big clear
 MSmits: so big jumps seem to me to be more likely in cases dominated by 1 color
 Westicles: I'd be happy to be wrong.  That's the only one where I have the record on jsgames, so I might not be an objective observer&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah and as I said, who knows
 MSmits: unverified means just that
 petticode: Hi, I am beginner . Can anyone tell me from where i should start? :disappointed:
 MSmits: beginner at coding?
 MSmits: do you know the basics in a particular language?
 petticode: yes i have learned javascript
 MSmits: start by doing easy puzzles i guess
 petticode: where i can find easy one?
 MSmits: get used to the way input works and try to solve one that you like
 MSmits: there are over 100
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 dbdr: in case 9, there are 60 of the main color right?
 dbdr: so max score is 3600 for that
 petticode: can you tell me what are readLine and parseInt func?
 dbdr: (62 - 2, sorry)
 dbdr: tr -d '"' | tr ',;' '\n'|sort |uniq -c | sort -n
 dbdr: can you do that in your format aCat?&#160;;)
 dbdr: (I mean you can, but I expect it will be more work)
 Westicles: Right, and to get close to 3600 you can't clump the other colors much.  
 dbdr: upper bound of score for case 9: 9693 + 1000
 MSmits: hmm do you use the upper bound to know you've solved it?
 dbdr: no, it's surely unattainable
 MSmits: I guess maybe at the last 3-4 moves your score will actually be the upper bound
 dbdr: yes, you can for small boards
 dbdr: I saw it mentioned for A* type searches which need an upper bound
 MSmits: wonder if it is worth implementing that
 dbdr: sounds rather cheap to implement, so maybe
 MSmits: hm ok
 dbdr: oh, euler hadn't been out of top 3 for a long time
 Marchete: how are the recolored validators?
 dbdr: recolored
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: I need to permute all to just find it?
 xlr4829: from hexa FF to decimal 255 use parseInt(FF,16) with 16 represent base 
 dbdr: just canonicalize the colors
 dbdr: e.g. the order in which they appear first
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: much better
 dbdr: you don't need to try all permutations
 dbdr: I identify a board by it's top line, it's unique
 dbdr: *its
 <b>**dbdr goes away in shame</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I turn the board into a long string and compare the whole thing :P
 dbdr: cleaner
 MSmits: just gained 800 points on case 1. I think I did 40 or so runs before
 MSmits: so it is possible to get a huge jump even after lots of cpu invested
 MSmits: (a run is like 2 minutes)
 MSmits: possibly i just cleared it for the first time
 MSmits: I still dont check that
 Westicles: Which color are you focusing on for case1?
 MSmits: No idea
 MSmits: I do mcts
 MSmits: but in rollout i avoid common color
 Westicles: oh
 MSmits: most common color
 MSmits: it's possible that in different parts of the tree, the most common color is different
 Westicles: Looks like I have red as the taboo color, but it is third most common
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: hmm well color counts are so close that this doesnt matter in my case
 MSmits: since i build a mcts tree, i will soon hit a situation in which red *is* the most common color in the rollout
 MSmits: doesnt take much depth
 Westicles: Hmmm.  I guess it is possible that your program could figure out the best color on its own, but ultimately you'll probably have to figure out the best one and force it
 dbdr: the best might be to change the tabu along the way...
 MSmits: oh did you do a lot of manual forcing?
 eulerscheZahl: is trictrac hardcoding?
 Westicles: There isn't much scoring outside of biggest group+1000, except on a couple of the tricky ones
 trictrac: yes
 eulerscheZahl: then i'm relieved
 MSmits: I think my best score without hardcoding is about 116k
 eulerscheZahl: but Marchete with a nice score for only 50% :o
 MSmits: yeah thats high
 MSmits: also hardcoded i am thinking
 dbdr: ice falling from the sky :o
 dbdr: the earth is weird
 JBM: ice elemental ftw
 MSmits: Marchete at nr 2
 MSmits: with 159k
 eulerscheZahl: saw it
 eulerscheZahl: well done
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: nice Marchete
 MSmits: the 50% was to check if hardcoding was going properly&#160;:)
 Westicles: That's what you get for helping with the recoloring
 dbdr: the hard part :D
 MSmits: no doubt
 MSmits: meta mcts should do great here then
 MSmits: I habitually force the search in directions I think are good
 dbdr: Marchete: thanks for the motivation&#160;;)
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: I know you'll beat me
 Marchete: you always do
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 Marchete: the 50% was because I was doing only the cases without the recoloring
 Marchete: I needed to link them
 Westicles: Nice, that's good for fifth on that website
 Marchete: and for frying bacon in my CPU
 dbdr: are you running in C#, or just the player part?
 Marchete: just for the player
 Westicles: Is this one like NS where you can get the badge for every language?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you get 100% on optim/golf/puzzle, you get an achievement
 Marchete: well, there is a puzzle whose solution was something like sqrt(2*n), or mars lander
 dbdr: inb4 #1 in a minor language
 eulerscheZahl: you just have to submit some dummy, doesn't even have to be your highest score
 dbdr: there's a puzzle where anything is 100%, no?
 eulerscheZahl: A*Craft
 eulerscheZahl: and REALLY easy for CG sponsored contest
 eulerscheZahl: and for number shifting
 dbdr: Marchete increasing fast
 eulerscheZahl: calm down
 eulerscheZahl: making faster progress in that high range than me at 140k
 wlesavo: damn, Marchete stole euler's rightful second place
 Westicles: Not long until first
 dbdr: MSmits stole my rightful #3
 MSmits: you dont have better scores to submit?
 dbdr: I have a bit better
 MSmits: When I saw myself at 3 I figured, oh he already kicked me down again, but it was Marchete :P
 dbdr: more and more people in the top 3
 MSmits: :confused:
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you evil thieves. i'll sue you
 Illedan: Oh, Marchete joined the party too :thinking:
 dbdr: BMSMA
 Illedan: Is that your algo dbdr?
 dbdr: no, something Bender would reply to eulerscheZahl
 wlesavo: euler should write a paper and claim second best results with hashed solutions 
 Illedan: hashed solutions?
 MSmits: Bite My Shiny Metal Ass
 eulerscheZahl: i should edit the referee, submit my code and then revert to old referee
 wlesavo: its kind of meme from todays chat Illedan 
 dbdr: fae46e47dccd500f4fd2ab937d4e0d6c814819a5f5ddd8643bcba265bf46df14hash of my solutions with 195k points
 Illedan: xD
 Marchete: then submit it
 kovi: duh, it looks like im the weakest of hardcoders&#160;:(
 MSmits: 183266 = max from sources I checked
 wlesavo: Marchete then cg would own the world best solution, no way!
 dbdr: nah, I'm worried CG devs would steal my solutions
 MSmits: kovi hardcoding takes time
 eulerscheZahl: a 256bit hash, looks like you created one for real and weren't entering random characters
 Illedan: Marchete, did you find the solutions online? :thinking:
 dbdr: echo "GOT IT"|sha256sum
 wlesavo: Marchete wanted to steal dbdr's solution from cg sservers
 Marchete: it worked
 MSmits: Illedan doubt it, Marchete is pretty good at optims as far as i can tell. He  did well at numbershifting too
 Illedan: I know .P
 Illedan: :P
 Marchete: by hand level 80 or so :D
 Illedan: There is some open sourced C++ solver of SameGame on github as I saw. No idea how good
 Illedan: Lol
 MSmits: i saw it
 Marchete: the rest of them it was done by my PC
 Illedan: Solving SameGame by hand? :D 
 MSmits: seems crap :P
 Marchete: Number shifting
 wlesavo: same shifting
 Marchete: it was a fun optim
 Illedan: Agreed
 Marchete: I pity I went out of ideas
 Illedan: Until a certain level -.-
 eulerscheZahl: how's the app going Illedan?
 eulerscheZahl: i want to get rich
 dbdr: it worked so well he got better solutions than me??
 Illedan: It's the next on my list. Will finalize my blog webpage today. And then the app&#160;:) 
 dbdr: "tomorrow I'll start"
 Illedan: Yeah, getting settled in the new house now
 Illedan: getting more time for coding again
 Illedan: :rocket:
 Marchete: Number shifting, procastination edition
 Solacefire: I'm #1 in my grouping in the coders strike back challenge, how do I rank up?
 Illedan: Just wait Solacefire
 Illedan: There should be a timer above the leaderboard. And you need to wait for 100&#160;% submission
 Solacefire: 15H 48...guess I'm done for the day
 Illedan: What league?
 Solacefire: Wood 1
 Illedan: That should be in minutes..
 Illedan: Give it some time.
 Solacefire: Oh, it was at 15.48 GMT, I see
 kovi: cant improve any moreok, after tomorrow 12am lets reset with new judges and no more mass hardcoding
 SirMiska: Hey how is everyone doing today?
 jurkis: not great
 SirMiska: Why is that jurkis?
 SaurabhNegi123: can anyone help me with coders strike back wood 2 league
 AntiSquid: no, all the people above are stuck in wood 2 so doubt it
 JayBeest: i might
 Melo_07: Meh
 JayBeest: i dmed you
 JayBeest: some kind of running joke or? total silence..
 Laminator: facebook hacker cup round 1 starts in a few minutes. Thanks for pointing it out to me!

 Zenoscave: cgfunge prime has a bug
 Zenoscave: | operator does nothing
 Zenoscave: Nevermind it's my font. It should be an uppercase I (eye) not a Vertical Bar
 jacek: oO
 dbdr: Zenoscave: nice contrarian attitude&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: cgfunge is fun
 Zenoscave: I made a mistake lol
 Zenoscave: Couldn't read the font in the instructions
 dbdr: by conntrarian I mean, picking a different optim than everyone else
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave is getting back to that old puzzle? nice
 Zenoscave: I thought of a better algo
 Zenoscave: Oh The I was for debugging. I don't  know what everyone else uses 
 eulerscheZahl: robo is using Rabin-Miller afaik
 Zenoscave: huh
 eulerscheZahl: enough to test with base 2 for the given validators
 dbdr: \o/
 eulerscheZahl: what did dbdr break this time?
 eulerscheZahl: 150k :D
 eulerscheZahl: troll
 dbdr: no
 dbdr: 150000
 dbdr: will you believe it's a coincidence?
 Zenoscave: 150000 what?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure you can score higher

 Zenoscave: That's what everyone was floodfilling
 dbdr: right now I can't
 eulerscheZahl: wait, it's a coincidence for real? :o
 dbdr: yep
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm back to 4th
 eulerscheZahl: could beat smits but not you
 dbdr: I was waiting for 150k+ to submit, and bam
 MSmits: trying something new currently
 MSmits: hope it helps
 MSmits: I do mcts with 1 minute turns and a node pool reset. 1 run will take an hour
 MSmits: I was doing 4 second turn runs without resetting tree and occasionally running out of node pool even with 80 million nodes
 MSmits: and with 100 million nodes, the array gets too big, program is not allowed to run
 MSmits: so i figured if i am going to reset the tree, then i might as well do loooong ass turns
 eulerscheZahl: or you run it for a while, then take the first move as granted and search again from there
 MSmits: thats basically what i am doing now
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 MSmits: I run it for  1 min, take best move and do it again
 MSmits: so that will take like an hour
 eulerscheZahl: the last moves should be faster if you have code to handle this case
 MSmits: you mean because it sovles?
 MSmits: solves?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: yeah i do
 MSmits: but it does not use transpositions
 eulerscheZahl: also lots of identical nodes. removing group A and B vs B and A
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: not sure how to do this with mcts
 eulerscheZahl: me neither :P
 MSmits: how do you make zobrist work here?
 MSmits: the order of actions does matter
 dbdr: wasn't that discussed before?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a beam search
 dbdr: it
 MSmits: I know
 dbdr: it's not a tree, it's a DAG
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes the order matters, sure
 MSmits: whats a DAG?
 dbdr: MCDS I guess&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: directed acyclic graph
 dbdr: directed acyclic graph
 eulerscheZahl: haha
 dbdr: ^
 MSmits: whats the difference?
 dbdr: you can have several parents
 MSmits: hmm ok
 dbdr: diamond
 dbdr: because of transpositions
 MSmits: yeah but thats true for most board games also
 MSmits: so i cant call any of those trees anymore?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Polytree.svg/200px-Polytree.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Polytree.svg/200px-Polytree.svg.png</a>
 MSmits: and some of my bots do MCDAGS?
 MSmits: yeah  I know what you meant
 MSmits: so... back to zobrist, trying to wrap my head around it
 MSmits: I know you xor stuff together and that the order doesnt matter and in that way you detect transpositions
 dbdr: is zobrist the problem or the DAG part?
 MSmits: zobrist coul dbe the solution to the DAG part
 MSmits: I have too much branching because i ignore transposition
 MSmits: in my mcts
 dbdr: if you don't have transpositions, you have a tree, not a DAG
 MSmits: I know I currently have a tree
 dbdr: (technically a DAG, but not an interesting one)
 MSmits: but the game is a DAG
 MSmits: so I should treat it like one
 dbdr: "everything is a graph"&#160;:)
 MSmits: to do better...
 dbdr: inb4 MCDAGSWEPT
 dbdr: acronyms are fun
 MSmits: lol no
 dbdr: oh, SWEPT even reads nicely
 MSmits: so here's my question, zobrist is coupled with actions right, not gamestates?
 dbdr: it's a keeper
 Scarfield: whats the w for?
 Astrobytes: "with"
 dbdr: WITH
 eulerscheZahl: you can couple zobrist with states
 dbdr: oops, not an acronym. OR IS IT?
 MSmits: hmm how, if there are millions?
 eulerscheZahl: every property of the state has a value
 dbdr: WIde Iterative Tree Heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: there's a red cell on (7,12)? hash XOR with 43627482
 Astrobytes: lol dbdr
 dbdr: it's acronyms all the way down
 eulerscheZahl: i hate acronyms
 Scarfield: IHA
 MSmits: right, i get that, but the zobrist thing should not slow down your search too much. 
 dbdr: ^^
 MSmits: you cant do this for every cell can you?
 eulerscheZahl: i do :P
 MSmits: hmm thats pretty awesome
 eulerscheZahl: you can try incremental hashing as well
 MSmits: what happens on collisions, do you have a comparison check?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: the point of zobrist is to do it incrementally, as I understand it
 MSmits: so when you remove cells, you de-XOR them and re-XOR something else in place?
 eulerscheZahl: for same game i'm not even sure if incremental is that much better
 eulerscheZahl: there are small changes (removing a block at the top)
 eulerscheZahl: but also bigger ones (block at the bottom)
 eulerscheZahl: and yes MSmits
 MSmits: hmm so basically at the start of the game you generate 225 * 5 random 64 bit integers?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: and then on your Apply Move thingy, you just add that in
 eulerscheZahl: *6 for blank if you want. but that's redundant
 MSmits: seems straightforward
 MSmits: yeah blank seems redunant and expensive
 MSmits: redundant
 MSmits: seems doable
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised that you didn't come across zobrist earlier
 MSmits: i did come across it, i just always decided not to use it
 eulerscheZahl: than i'm surprised you didn't use it :P
 eulerscheZahl: then
 MSmits: can you name a game or optim where i should have? 
 MSmits: just curious
 dbdr: hypersonic maybe?
 eulerscheZahl: whenever you care about duplicate states. also depends on your search
 aCat: breakthrough?
 MSmits: i use a map in hypersonic
 MSmits: unordered map
 eulerscheZahl: i like to use it in combination with minimax
 MSmits: lots of xor-ing 
 aCat: other multis with simple states to check collisions when minmaxing / mctsing?
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. my checkers bot has it
 MSmits: hmm eulerscheZahl but what do you do when you come across a duplicate state?
 jacek: zobrist hash eh?
 MSmits: in minimax
 MSmits: is not not going to interfere with alpha beta to just ignore it?
 eulerscheZahl: use old score from previous run
 eulerscheZahl: you have to hash alpha+beta too
 aCat: you also store depth with the state info
 MSmits: hmm I see
 dbdr: same state -&gt; same result
 jacek: im too umb for zobrist hash. i just use my own hash
 dbdr: no need to recompute it
 MSmits: same jacek
 MSmits: but samegame is a bit painful
 MSmits: having to hash the whole thing every time
 jacek: if youre asking what the transposition table is for... then its for transpositions... and for ordering using previous interation in IDDFS
 MSmits: no no, i know that
 MSmits: I am just trying to figure out what to use for samegame
 jacek: and afaik zobrist allows you to incrementally hash things
 eulerscheZahl: it does
 MSmits: yeah
 aCat: you just hash difference
 aCat: not entire state every time
 MSmits: maybe i should recode my bot to do the map as uint64_t[15]
 MSmits: then i could just XOR-shift those 15 rows together
 Astrobytes: MBits incoming
 MSmits: well it's doable
 MSmits: 3 bits per color
 MSmits: times 15 = 45
 Astrobytes: Surprised you didn't try it already tbh
 MSmits: can also more easily shift rows
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: i could have 
 MSmits: but it makes my head hurt with the shifting and such
 Astrobytes: When has that ever stopped you? :P
 MSmits: well I guess it shouldnt have, its more a matter of complication upon complication. Samegame already has a pretty complicated sim thats easily bugged
 MSmits: but since its working fine now, i should try it
 MSmits: i did this in ooc btw
 MSmits: I had a 64 bit map for mines I think
 MSmits: each cell had info of how many mines are nearby
 MSmits: hmm or maybe that was 32 bit, i know something was 64
 MSmits: o right, the damage map, each map could hold up to 15 damge in 4 bit
 MSmits: allright, gotta go do that recoding and get some transposition magic
 MSmits: oh lol my first testcase 3 runs are done. The 1 min turn time definitely helped a lot. The 3 finished ones are all near the highest score and one beat it by 2 points
 MSmits: wheras my last 15 runs on 4 seconds were all worse
 Astrobytes: You're doing 1 minute turns?
 MSmits: yeah its something new i am trying
 MSmits: couldnt keep the tree any longer due to limitations of node pool
 MSmits: so i figured if i need to reset the tree anyway, why not use long ass turns
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, makes sense
 Zenoscave: Miller Rabin seems like the way to go
 Zenoscave: Just need to figure out exponentiation
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Zenoscave: different puzzle sorry
 dbdr: "if it's working, break it"
 Zenoscave: dbdr do you exploit validators?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: of course!&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 dbdr: that's the fun part
 Zenoscave: just if else with -&#160;:
 Zenoscave:&#160;?
 dbdr: something like that
 Zenoscave: mind updating the repo&#160;;)
 MSmits: which puzzle is this Zenoscave?
 Zenoscave: CGFunge Prime
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: never done that
 Zenoscave: It's a different puzzle style for sure
 Zenoscave: You'd learn some new areas of programming. SOP for example
 Astrobytes: validators on the repo no?
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming</a>No Astrobytes
 Zenoscave: wait which repo
 eulerscheZahl: same game? yes validators are public
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/CGFunge-Prime/tree/master/config">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/CGFunge-Prime/tree/master/config</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that too
 Zenoscave: glorious
 Zenoscave: It changes the whole puzzle. It is now an inexact partitioning scheme puzzle
 MSmits: Zenoscave has the words today
 <b>**dbdr starts to worry about his rank</b></p><p><img src="/a/16732569385856" /> Zenoscave: I'm comming for you dbdr
 dbdr: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: hint: with string mode and unicode you can load constants
 dbdr: on the other hand, I knew I could do better, just didn't have any reason to
 Zenoscave: I know about the unicode
 dbdr: but do you know about the unicorn?
 Zenoscave: That part won't be hard. emoji's? unicode-9 yeah
 eulerscheZahl: the unicode wasn't even a planned feature
 dbdr: that's the best kind of feature
 Zenoscave: did you search for best comparisons? dbdr?
 eulerscheZahl: code to generate code that is interpreted by more code
 dbdr: to some degree
 dbdr: the 2D constraint mean it's not an obvious search
 dbdr: it's interpreters all the way down
 dbdr: especially if the world is a simulation
 eulerscheZahl: we are all living in a huge turing machine
 dbdr: which, according to some arguments, is almost certain
 eulerscheZahl: the "huge" makes no sense as every turing machine can do the same
 eulerscheZahl: so the Beatles were wrong
 dbdr: yes, and it could take 1 year to simulate a picosecond, and we would not know it&#160;:)
 dbdr: what did they say?
 Astrobytes: "so the Beatles were wrong" hahahha
 Astrobytes: well played
 eulerscheZahl: we all live in a yellow submarine
 dbdr: what if it's a universal yellow submarine?
 Zenoscave: But the interpretation of what the mechanics in a yellow submarine do could count as a turing machine 
 dbdr: On the Turing-completeness of Yellow Submarines
 Zenoscave: I call dibs
 dbdr: it's yours. run with it!
 Zenoscave: YES
 dbdr: just credit the CG chat as appropriate
 Zenoscave: Will do
 dbdr: in the thanks section
 Astrobytes: lol, 100% would read
 eulerscheZahl: and smits will request your paper for free on researchgate or however it's called
 dbdr: is that a scandal?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: it's the epilogue
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9JgxhXW5w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9JgxhXW5w</a>
 Westicles: The people running the sim are having trouble emulating all our CPUs, but they have plenty for GPUs so they are making us switch over
 dbdr: didn't get the epilogue
 MSmits: ahh so researchgate is a scandal
 MSmits: got it
 dbdr: yep
 dbdr: or is it researchgategate?
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: mmh this is too complicated for me. I'll stick with my bits
 dbdr: logicgategate
 Astrobytes: Ah, that time when the AND was NOT
 dbdr: caused a shift to the left
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: :confused:
 MSmits: well got 100% with the new bitboard, but not somewhat worse performanc
 MSmits: without the not
 MSmits: I am hoping the transpositions will be worth it
 jacek: what about researchgate
 MSmits: dunno
 Marchete: westicles has better scores than most papers around there...
 Scarfield: damn, was he testing your contribution, he made his submit very early iirc
 scout102: yanderedev
 Illedan: Marchete, got link to some good papers?
 Marchete: I haven't read them yet, just cross reading searching for top scores per test
 Marchete: to know where to use more CPU
 Marchete: I'm rotating 5 tests each hour
 Illedan: ah, alright

 Marchete: it seems they have the highest ones
 Illedan: Yes
 Illedan: He is sampson
 Marchete: makes sense, I'd be 5th in that rank, but there is a big gap after his place
 Illedan: But those games give negative score for not finished games I see
 Illedan: Meaning they had to finish them all
 MSmits: I suspect the best scores from papers also finished them all
 MSmits: the bonus is quite big
 Illedan: Wonder if the testcases are in the same order
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: pretty sure they are, I would have noticed otherwise

 Marchete: I just randomly tested, but it seems it's the same
 Illedan:&#160;:+1:
 Marchete: well, they use the weird start at 1 and not 0
 Marchete: so test 1 to 20 means [0..19]

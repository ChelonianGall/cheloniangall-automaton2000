 ProCoder03: how to see who are all are there in your school&#160;??

 ProCoder03: Thanks Uljahn
 Sumit-coder: in python for accessing array from back we do [:1] and how we can do it in JS
 eulerscheZahl: how is that python sample doing anything from the back?'12345'[:1] just returns '1'
 Magus: Sumit-coder: myArray[myArray.length - 1]
 Magus: javascript doesn't have any other way for the moment
 eulerscheZahl: even C# has array[^1] to access the last item
 jdsigg: You can do array.pop() if you don't care about preserving the array
 jdsigg: can't do much better, I think. Could be wrong, but I gravitate towards those two solutions depending on my needs.
 Magus: array.reverse()[0] works too
 Magus: but no efficient
 AryanSilswal: Has anyone worked on knights tour problem
 piratas: how do you guys debug minor issues in string formatting where your string looks exactly the same but there's a found "\n" expected "nothing" error or something similar?
 piratas: its a figlet like string so hard to see where the issue can be, is there some sort of setting to see line number as well?
 OliverC: @AryanSilswal
 OliverC: I did that one earlier
 OliverC: It's just a 2D binary search
 lactose: where is debug mode? i don't see it in settings like it says it should be
 eulerscheZahl: which game/puzzle lactose?
 eulerscheZahl: there should be a gear icon under the replay viewer
 lactose: im on the pod racing in the beginning of the AI track 
 lactose: oh i see it
 eulerscheZahl: coders strike back. that one definitely has a debug view
 lactose: there are 3 different gear icons lol had me confused
 eulerscheZahl: the chat gear?
 lactose: and all the way on the left
 eulerscheZahl: i see :D
 lactose: in the side bar menu
 eulerscheZahl: the editor settings
 lactose: is there a way to print out debug info without having it be the actual output?
 bluethrush: raise an exception
 eulerscheZahl: there is the way that makes your bot say it in a speech bubble
 eulerscheZahl: and with stderr
 eulerscheZahl: Console.Error in C# or whatever the equivalent in your language is

 DustinNunyo: Hmm... Does anyone have time to look at my DFS algorithm and tell me why it's not returning the shortest path?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey DustinNunyo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 DustinNunyo: def shortestPathDFSNoRecursion( start, end ): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2464019d-9831-40a4-8f53-28c3995961ba">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2464019d-9831-40a4-8f53-28c3995961ba</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you want the shortest path, generally I'd go with BFS and not DFS
 big_rooster_energy: can you paste your node object?
 big_rooster_energy: ohhhhhh best_path = path[:]
 big_rooster_energy: try that
 big_rooster_energy: @DustinNunyo ^^
 big_rooster_energy: if that isnt the fix i would suggest debugging with a print inside the if len(path) &lt; best_length: conditional
 Mjdoo: tf
 DustinNunyo: lol I accidentally lost the tab that it was open in, lol give me a sec.
 Mjdoo: this is impossible 
 DustinNunyo:  nope that didn't fix it unfortunately. lol
 DustinNunyo: class Node(): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83727d8b-7903-4814-9d3b-9a0604a22b58">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83727d8b-7903-4814-9d3b-9a0604a22b58</a>

 DustinNunyo: I just copy/pasted my full code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You don't know if you are visiting a node twice?
 big_rooster_energy: he checks the path
 big_rooster_energy: and continues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oic
 big_rooster_energy: put print statements everywhere and do a base case like1 -- 2 -- 3 --4
 big_rooster_energy: good cluck
 Mjdoo: impossible
 DustinNunyo: it looks like it's only evaluating one path and then quitting for some reason... hmm....
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the path just gets bigger
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think
 DustinNunyo: OOOOooooh ok, I get it... I need to clear the path after finding the end. lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BFS works better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: use two stacks
 DustinNunyo: Yeah, I plan on implementing BFS but I want to do DFS first
 DustinNunyo: I am running through a kind of marathon where I implement DFS, DFS with no recursion, BFS, then BFS with no recursion
 PatrickMcGinnisII: add all the links to the second stack, and when done...pop the last node off the path
 DustinNunyo: then finally I want to try to implement Dijkstra's
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, gotcha... yea, if it's been visited.. i think u got it
 tutubalin: PatrickMcGinnisII BFS with queue is better, as it can be easier converted into Dijkstra
 DustinNunyo: yeah, now it just runs forever... lol
 tutubalin: just replace queue with priority queue and it's done

 Mjdoo: wtf
 Mjdoo: how am i supposed to fix this?
 DustinNunyo: it's comparing y and y
 DustinNunyo: you need to compare x and y
 Uljahn: fix the typo
 DustinNunyo: err you need to submit* x and y
 Mjdoo: bro
 Mjdoo: im new
 Mjdoo: i really suck at this
 DustinNunyo: console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' 50');
 Mjdoo: oh
 Mjdoo: nanimoyo?
 Mjdoo: whats that?
 DustinNunyo: I just changed the first "nextCheckpointY" to "nextCheckpointX"
 Mjdoo: oh there we go
 Mjdoo: a boss
 Mjdoo: EZ
 Mjdoo: bro

 Manchi_o6o7: How to represent a weighted graph which has nodes as strings and the weights are chars
 Jean-Petrus2: @Sergay your nickname smells like sperm 
 slackintime:&#160;!
 5DN1L: banned
 Sergay: it's true
 Astrobytes: Manchi_o6o7: although I don't mind that you frequently ask here for advice regarding coursework or whatever, given that graphs are generally an abstraction of something in most use cases, I really urge you to think this one through yourself.
 Manchi_o6o7: I don't think it's the best way how you formulated your message, because it's not my intention to get some code or anything like that, but to really learn something.
 Manchi_o6o7: being a student is something that has nothing to do with what I'm asking about
 5DN1L: have you tried to think through the problem or do some googling / researching? Manchi_o6o7
 Astrobytes: don't mean to sound offensive&#160;:)I just think it's important to be able to abstract the graph from your information by yourself, given the prevalence of graph-based issues these days
 Astrobytes: a quick search should bring you quite a few examples
 Astrobytes: One data structure in particular springs to mind, and it should not be difficult to find
 jacek: adjacency matrix?
 Astrobytes: strings for nodes and chars for edges, weighted
 jacek: sounds weird
 Astrobytes: It's not
 struct: Anyone has any idea on how to get started on games like gitc and code of ice and fire?
 struct: I dont understand how I can make an AI where I have to output multiple actions per turn

 Rexou: You can have a class Turn &amp; Command
 Rexou: and add your actions into current turn while there are enough resources &amp; time for it
 Rexou: at the end you just output your turn which outputs its list of actions separated by ';' for example if you play GITC
 Astrobytes: yeah, same in LoCM
 Astrobytes: apply actions as you go
 Astrobytes: it's easy enough struct, just a slightly different way of doing things from your average board game&#160;;)
 Rexou: if you abstract things properly you can even re-use the Turn  &amp; Command + a State class to create a simple simulation

 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: lol
 struct: Just in time for me to port backgammon
 struct: lol
 Karang: :D
 eulerscheZahl: 2 days ago, i'm sure you are responsible for it
 kovi: so it is for any games from now on?
 eulerscheZahl: found it yesterday while i wanted to understand how the toggle stores the state between replays
 DaNinja: no more cracking rngs?&#160;:)
 struct: All that use sdk 4.2 kovi
 kovi: i c
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure the game referee itself still has to utilize SecureRandom
 eulerscheZahl: there is no point in having a truly random seed that can still be reversed based on outputs
 struct: So this doesnt fix anything?
 eulerscheZahl: Provide a getRandom function to an instance of SecureRandom, please use this instead of creating your own Random
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/playground/misc/misc-3-release-notes.md">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/playground/misc/misc-3-release-notes.md</a>
 Karang: i've identified 2 problems with secure random, the first that they avoid in the PR is that depending on the alg used, it can be not reproducible, the second is the increased computation time (yes lcg are not that secure, but they are fast)
 Karang: looking a bit at past challenges, i think this was the first one where the technique i used could be used effectively
 eulerscheZahl: you don't need that much random in the referee for it to be significant
 struct: recurse used it on c4l
 eulerscheZahl: but with little success
 struct: But maybe diferent method
 eulerscheZahl: he reversed 2 or 3% of the games
 Karang: not a lot of challenges use rng, and the one that did, didn't provide as many bits of information in the inputs
 Karang: yeah but he used bruteforce
 Astrobytes: that was more of a side-quest for him in C4L I think
 Karang: and was only able to get the seed mid-game
 struct: Yeah bruteforce
 struct: I also tried his method for STC
 struct: but I dont think it helps at all
 Karang: the problem is that shuffle uses nextInt which is a huge pain to reverse
 eulerscheZahl: 8 stones are enough to play it properly
 Karang: especially when doing nextInt(k) with a small k
 jacek: well it will be more important to have secure random in backgammon
 jacek: see what happens where there is no random like 2048 :v
 Karang: but if i understood correctly the PR you sent only change how the seed is generated&#160;? so i don't really get the point
 eulerscheZahl: but they put some effort into it and fixed the seed reversing. i see this as a positive sign for the future
 eulerscheZahl: you are then supposed to use a getRandom() which returns a SecureRandom instance i think
 Karang: ok
 eulerscheZahl: there are more commits about it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/commits/master">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/commits/master</a>
 Astrobytes: more of a fundamental change than a quick hacky fix then
 eulerscheZahl: still the game author has to follow this guideline
 eulerscheZahl: for map generation it's irrelevant. just for randomness during the actual game
 Karang: yes the only time when it matters is when the random is used through the game (so cracking can be used to predict future inputs)
 kovi: why is it irrelevant for map?
 jacek: unless its fow map
 eulerscheZahl: example Tryangle Catch: you get a random map in inputs. but it's a full information game
 kovi: any foggy game can benefit. like your enhanced code keeper
 eulerscheZahl: hm, good point
 Karang: could be used in the card games also, but again the use of shuffle makes it non trivial to crack
 eulerscheZahl: for map generation on code keeper will be a pain to reverse too
 Karang: maybe once you've seen more than half of the deck you have enough information to crack the rest
 eulerscheZahl: DFS with backtracking
 eulerscheZahl: and you don't even know the starting point of the maze generation
 kovi: hmm...can be true....as the info to track is not avail
 kovi: (for a long timeÖ
 eulerscheZahl: even then, the generation of the map itself takes a millisecond or two
 eulerscheZahl: you can't generate thousands of them to see if it matches
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should still update and use SecureRandom
 struct: is that a challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: still not released, aCat is slow :P
 jacek: like SecureRandom
 kovi: you dont have to generate whole mapjust call random enough times&#160;:)
 aCat: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: like CG language updates
 aCat: ah code for my game?
 kovi: to compare the known parts
 eulerscheZahl: code keeper map generator
 eulerscheZahl: that's not how the map generation works kovi
 aCat: yeah, yeah 
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know how often you have to call it. there can be some calls in between the visible parts
 aCat: its too much shit in the code I really do not want to show&#160;;]
 kovi: ok, i never looked into that
 antiwonto: [auto] aCat be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it's not public yet
 aCat: I will cut it off and make public repo, ehhh
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't dig through your code. just enough to replace the maps
 aCat: I know, but I know what is tehre
 Karang: you can crackit without bruteforce if you have enough information, but it all depends how many bits you can extract from what is given to you
 kovi: that is another way to solve the random issue  :)
 aCat: and to be useful engine should be public
 aCat: and as you know there are 3 games in one there euler
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 3 branches
 eulerscheZahl: and i made my map gen on a 4th
 aCat: :D
 aCat: about releasying games, SC22 still not up?
 Jabster28: ggs
 eulerscheZahl: did you even publicly tell that there are 3 versions of the game until now?
 aCat: nope ;p
 Astrobytes: first time I heard
 eulerscheZahl: spider game should come this week
 aCat: I mean my students have access to singleplaer optim
 aCat: there is multi as you know
 Astrobytes: julien already created the forum thread for it, maybe today
 aCat: singleplayer optim for my stuents to test
 aCat: and there should be norma puzzle with maps to solve and a lore and plot
 Astrobytes:  Isee
 aCat: last thing abandoned, too much work&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: Spider Attack, sounds like they really want to rename it
 Astrobytes: *I see
 aCat: but after this contest I have new cool game idea
 Astrobytes: aCat: get a student to do it for you :D
 aCat: really weird 4person multi :devil:
 aCat: ehhh
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you can convince CG to make it a community event
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Bestar: beans
 eulerscheZahl: no idea how many players that will attract
 aCat: I will definitely try
 aCat: I do not trust students to do a proper game
 Astrobytes: (I was joking!)
 eulerscheZahl: do you trust former students?
 aCat: Codekeeper was done by a student once - I had to writi=te it entirely myself because
 aCat: meh
 aCat: former students have no reason to do anything
 aCat: they usually just pufff disappear&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: domi is still around
 Astrobytes: ^
 aCat: also gamemaking is less attractive than playing
 eulerscheZahl: creating games can also be fun
 aCat: Let Domi focus on playing :P
 aCat: I know, you know
 aCat: they not necessarily&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: He made Abalone
 aCat: and ... java ;p
 eulerscheZahl: kotlin, scala, clojure
 aCat: yeah, that was cool
 eulerscheZahl: there are alternatives

I Compiled the source code from github but when i try to watch my bot games via localhost:8888/tst.html it did behave as it supposed to it either timed out after couple rounds or did not play like it was playing on the site.

 5DN1L: Does CG always transfer the codes submitted in contests to bot programming games? I'd thought we'd have to start from Wood League again
 struct: it used to be like that
 struct: but not anymore
 Astrobytes: Thankfully
 5DN1L: ah, i see
 eulerscheZahl: for the last few contests it just moved all users and everything to the new arena
 eulerscheZahl: only downside: no XP farming
 Astrobytes: true
 eulerscheZahl: but we don't lose bots anymore
 eulerscheZahl: we still don't have all contest winners in the arenas
 Andr.ada: sql
 Nakotathepro: I need help on Mad Pod Racing 
 5DN1L: as discussed on the private chat, you need to learn the basics of programming ifrst
 5DN1L: first*
 Nakotathepro: ok
 5DN1L: then it's easier for you to do the puzzles and games here
 eulerscheZahl: but he's a pro, read the name
 jrke: why 1k players less in bot prog release of SC22?
 5DN1L: i don
 5DN1L: i don't judge by name
 struct: Name tells a lot, mine tells I dont use Java
 5DN1L: I agree that names can tell a lot
 5DN1L: but not everything
 5DN1L: Like even if that person is a pro, we don't know what kind of pro
 Lovemachine: can i ask a question about a puzzle here?
 5DN1L: go ahead and be specific
 jacek: i permit
 Scarfield: would it be a real question without a jacek approval
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: the Stephen Colbert DnD thing was epic, thanks&#160;:)
 Scarfield: nice only watched the start myself, was in the middle of another episode i wanted to finish first.
 Scarfield: but apparently he was a big fan, and still is&#160;:)
 Lovemachine: ok i solved it. the puzzle was supposed to give me 7 bit ascii chars. but one of them was 6 bit actually so i was supposed to pad with 0's in the beginning of it.
 Lovemachine: realized it while i was explaining my problem xd
 Astrobytes: It was a lot of fun, and yes, very much so!
 Scarfield: rubber ducking at its finest&#160;:)
 5DN1L: agreed
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I finally am starting to figure out these puzzles, thank god
 Scarfield: have you seen any Critical Role before Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: I think someone sent me one of their vids a while back Scarfield, but I subscribed this time&#160;;)
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: Am I the only one who needs to figure my life out?
 Scarfield: randomly started one of their videos some months ago, didnt notice it was 3hours long. watched maybe 2 hours before i wondered how long is this video xD
 Astrobytes: here we go again
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: hahaha yeah, the time flew by when I was watching. Very absorbing and engaging
 Scarfield: i like how Stephen Colbert is visible loving being a part of that session
 gustavofurquim: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time...
 tutubalin: thatonedreamsmpfan2.0 have you tried Stackoverflow yet?
 Astrobytes: He got dressed up and brought swords :D
 5DN1L: gustavofurquim it means literally you didn't output as required
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: tutubalin: not yet but I'll try it next ig
 Scarfield: yea thats some dedication&#160;:)
 gustavofurquim: 5DN1L oh ok I'm still trying to understand how it works
 Scarfield: which multi and what language gustavofurquim?
 Scarfield: multi/puzzle, what are you working on
 gustavofurquim: I'm doing Don't Panic - Episode 1, c#
 Ose: Hi
 Ose: Its been a long time

 gustavofurquim: I was debugging instead of writing it properly lol
 gustavofurquim: I just removed .Error
 gustavofurquim: thanks
 NewCoder09: I finished my algorithms path :cry:
 Scarfield: ah, noice :muscle:
 Ose: ohhh
 struct: The entire path?
 struct: NIce
 struct: I havent finished it
 NewCoder09: yeah 
 NewCoder09: I'm sad now 
 Scarfield: but you finished the CoC path didnt you struct? o0
 struct: yes
 NewCoder09: I haven't even started that path 
 Scarfield: you need the last one in algorithms path? i cheesed it a bit with some easy puzzles and different languages
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I really want to participate in this conversation but I have no idea what your talking about

 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. jacek now has 38 taco
 Automaton2000: if you do it all the way to go in a straight line
 Automaton2000: [auto] eulerschezahl has awarded wontonimo 10 tacos. wontonimo now has 39 taco
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 Scarfield: the pinging is back
 jacek: :tada:
 Astrobytes: lol, brilliant
 eulerscheZahl: i was genuinely confused until i realized it came from the other bot
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 Wontonimo: WHAT&#160;!?! Did I see that correctly that Automaton just made a taco post?
 Astrobytes: that also pinged euler :tada:
 Scarfield: double whammy
 Wontonimo: Haha
 Astrobytes: AutomatonNNs revenge
 Wontonimo: it's interesting that it used my name twice "awarded wontonimo 10 tacos. wontonimo now has 39 taco".  It could have just used another random name for the second part
 Scarfield: markov chain? 
 Wontonimo: it would have to be a chain of 3 or more
 Wontonimo: which, if it were, would mean a huge lookup
 Scarfield: okay, maybe it loves you like its mother
 Wontonimo: "As we write this article, Automaton2000’s core uses a history of 3 words to select the next word when generating a random sentence"
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's 3 words
 Automaton2000: i should just give up
 NewCoder09: Nooo Automaton2000 don't give up
 Automaton2000: and it was my first thought
 Scarfield: dont let us down Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: not if you want to see how much time do you use avx?
 NewCoder09: Automaton2000 don't think like this 
 Automaton2000: also why are you using bitboards?
 jzen: What's wrong with using bitboards, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i know that it is a real problem
 therealbeef: anyne used bitboards for spring contest?
 struct: which one?
 struct: 2021?
 therealbeef: 2022
 struct: I dont think its a bitboard game?
 therealbeef: some diehard bitboarders may have tried
 struct: bitboarders are still sane people
 Westicles: Wonton still missing... tsk tsk
 Wontonimo: what's missing Westicles&#160;?
 Westicles: You in Spider Attack
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: where my code go?
 Wontonimo: arrgh
 jacek: banned?
 Wontonimo: what&#160;?!?
 Wontonimo: why would I be banned?
 Westicles: ah, you just popped up in wood2
 Scarfield: i am 200ish places higher than contest placement, many others are not moved into the "arena" yet. they are working on it i believe
 Scarfield: "eulersche Zahl 05:09ᴾᴹthey have a problem that some players weren't moved to the game yetwait a bit, staff is working on it"
 Wontonimo: oh, okay
 Wontonimo: well, too late, i've already submitted my code&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: I hope they just move me to gold
 Westicles: you should be honored.  like 500 guys have asked on chat how to go down a league
 Scarfield: xD
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Scarfield: the chosen one, the descentor
 jacek: descented to the lowest levels of abyss
 Wontonimo: I am able to reach lows others cannot obtain anymore
 Scarfield: is there blackjack down there?
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: this is a concerning conversation-
 Scarfield: when i started with UTTT i ranked up, when i still wanted to test with the basic TTT rules, really wanted to be able to rank down then
 Wontonimo: never before have I seen such wild mana bu**sh**ery <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/632214055">https://www.codingame.com/replay/632214055</a>
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: XD
 Wontonimo: the total between the 2 players is above 2000
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I need serious help, I can't figure out clash of code
 Wontonimo: finished wood2, wood1, now surging through bronze
 Wontonimo: work on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine</a> instead.  problem solved
 Westicles: there's even a video for that one
 Wontonimo: but seriously, if clash is too fast for you, work on some easy puzzles
 Wontonimo: :unamused: yeah, I know

 Wontonimo: don't fall for jacek trolling thatonedreamsmpfan2.0
 Westicles: are you getting xp as you climb?
 Wontonimo: yup
 jacek: oO
 Scarfield: CHEATS!
 Wontonimo: I may not make it to gold though.  It was very very close in the contest
 Scarfield: mod privilege
 Wontonimo: HA
 kovi: Wontonimo my avg. self is 2400 wild
 Scarfield: :p
 Wontonimo: WOW kovi
 Wontonimo: that be wildin'
 struct: o.o
 Wontonimo: how am I not following you after all this time&#160;?
 Westicles: I guess I'll let Stealing Inputs expire.  Wouldn't be nice to let it get approved and then be unsolvable
 kovi: but it only works if there is attacker
 kovi: no attacker
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I need to get a life T-T
 Wontonimo: oh, that just put me over the edge of level 33 and now I'm level 34
 Wontonimo: still kovi, that is really impressive
 Westicles: well, fortunately it is impossible to have xp removed and go down levels...
 Westicles: :innocent:
 Scarfield: the only fair response would be to ban wonto
 Scarfield: :p
 Wontonimo:&#160;;(  well, I'd still have antiwonto
 Scarfield: what was the contest where a lot got ranked up to bronze(?) before it opened, or something of the like
 Astrobytes: and gold
 Wontonimo: I thought that was Totoro
 Scarfield: did we get the xp twice then, i dont think we did?
 Astrobytes: nope
 Astrobytes: was removed
 Scarfield: wonto you lucky bas*ard :p
 Wontonimo: :grin: happy to wear that title
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: lmao XD
 Scarfield: i call for an investiture to "knight" you with the accolade of Lucky Bas*ard
 Wontonimo: looks like I'm good for gold.  I just dragged someone up into it also, Despero got bumped
 Scarfield: was wild mana farming really enough for gold=
 Wontonimo: yup
 Wontonimo: full defence, farm wild
 Scarfield: lel
 Wontonimo: looks like the difference between Lexer31 and me (currently 1 and 2 in silver) is that Lexer31 allows his defenders to go further out and takes into account the vector of the bugs for priority
 Wontonimo: I only use their position
 Wontonimo: and I lose every match with Lexer31
 Scarfield: what was your contest rank wonto?
 Wontonimo: ah, lexer also uses wind well before the bugs are in his camp where as I use wind more as a last resort
 Wontonimo: I was 1339/7695
 Wontonimo: or 949/2131 in gold
 Wontonimo: mid gold
 Wontonimo: but just snuck in barely on the last day
 Wontonimo: how about you Scarfield&#160;?  how did you do?
 Scarfield: nice, pretty good with such a simple "cheese!
 Scarfield:&#160;! = "
 Scarfield: 748 i believe
 Wontonimo: did you do the double-wind attack?
 Wontonimo: if not, what did you do?
 Scarfield: 738/348 in gold
 Astrobytes: 664/274 gold here, pretty close Scarfield
 Astrobytes: i didn't submit anything for 3 or 4 days
 Scarfield: i did a mix of things, had a lot of ideas actually, but didnt take the time to implement.
 Astrobytes: I lost motivation until sunday, then it was too busy to do anything meaningful in the evening
 Wontonimo: I really wanted to try an minimal 0ply NN for this , but just too little time
 Scarfield: 1 attacker, 2 defenders. defender wind if not able to kill before bug gets to base, defender control or wind oppo. attacker if close to bug and close to my base. 
 jacek: "too little time", nice excuse ~
 Scarfield: both defenders rally together if low mana. attacker control oppo. defenders away, wind if opponets shielded and some other stuff
 Scarfield: i had more time, but just didnt take it&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: i had a funeral in Regina I had to fly out for
 BJD: I was right next to astrobytes, then i resubmitted today and rose 190 places
 Wontonimo: so, i have excuses
 Astrobytes: lol BJD
 Wontonimo: as we all do I suppose
 Wontonimo: i guess I just have my priorities backwards :P 
 Scarfield: i can make up many excuses, but well :shrug: just didnt put in the work
 Wontonimo: I mean, the dead can wait.  Am I right?
 Astrobytes: my bot's just a slightly modified version of my silver bot
 Scarfield: i want to laugh, but your priorities were on point
 jacek: mhm
 Scarfield: milk in my fridge was getting old, had to buy some new milk
 Astrobytes: had a rewrite on the go but the old one worked better
 Wontonimo: honestly though, I didn't really make time.  idk, just wasn't super motivated like totoro
 jacek: rewrite in go eh
 Wontonimo: lol Scarfield
 Astrobytes: ON the go
 Scarfield: was pretty motivated the first days, wrote a sim, and thought i would get a good idea of how to implement a sim to a search. didnt get an idea i trusted -&gt; made a heuristic bot lol
 Astrobytes: Go is quite nice actually, never used it for bot programming though
 Scarfield: when i read blaster poards PM i was a bit annoyed i didnt get a similar idea. such a "simple" approach
 Wontonimo: this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/34">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/34</a>&#160;?
 Scarfield: yup: " I consider several thousand possible points in the 800 range to move to, assign a value to each of them with an evaluation function and choose the best one"
 Scarfield: this line was the annoying part :p
 BJD: I was trying to copy blasterpoard's strategy, and managed to get to 10th, but then i added some 'improvements' and dropped to 100th and could never get close to 10th again
 Scarfield: its a completely different approach to searching than what i have done before, but seemed obvious when i read his pm
 Scarfield: pesky improvements

 Scarfield: oh i did
 Astrobytes: ^the story of how he stayed a kid for several days and became a beard
 Scarfield: he used beam search (chokudai is beam search variant?)
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: iterative widening instead of deepening
 Scarfield: nice ty e
 eulerscheZahl: and only sim for attacker as i understand it
 Astrobytes: was a good pm
 eulerscheZahl: and he went full reCurse by writing his own viewer
 Scarfield: my japanese is lacking unfortunately
 Astrobytes: translate did a decent job on it this time, unlike on his twitter posts
 jacek: you need to be more weeb
 eulerscheZahl: 修理する
 Scarfield: if i view cat girls as female cats, am i there yet?
 jacek: get weeber
 Astrobytes: on translationparty "jacek is a weeb" comes back as "Yessek was a Jeremian"
 Astrobytes: "chokudai search is the best" -&gt; "It's great to find Stingray"
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: english -&gt; japanese -&gt; english? or how does it work
 Astrobytes: yeah, multiple translations back and forth until it doesn't change any more
 Scarfield: nice, the logical way to do it
 Wontonimo: that was a nice write up by Bowwow
 eulerscheZahl: hm, none by siman<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://simanman.hatenablog.com/">https://simanman.hatenablog.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can type almost any japanese username in the URL and find some blogposts about CG or similar contests

 Astrobytes: the sheep shearing optim?
 eulerscheZahl: it's from the sheep shearing contest
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: they did some complicated stuff like probability of sheep at specific cells and flow algo to distribute farmers to sheep
 Astrobytes: told you there was a flow problem in that game
 eulerscheZahl: i did without and won, so ...
 Astrobytes: :D

 Automaton2000: i would be able to understand it
 Automaton2000: so you have to keep track of when i cut a link.
 Scarfield: some meme's get too much attention
 DustinNunyo: Anyone online who might be able to help me with a DFS algorithm? I am trying to re-write it without using recursion. Some people were telling me that I actually implemented BFS, which is cool, and something that I am definitely trying to do, but not really my intention at the moment as this is more of an educational project.
 DustinNunyo: def shortestPathDFSNoRecursion( start, end ): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2dedc3c8-eedc-4031-9998-bda736e196d9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2dedc3c8-eedc-4031-9998-bda736e196d9</a>
 jacek: shortest path sounds like BFS
 Scarfield: ^
 jacek: well, DFS uses stack, so looks alright
 jacek: do you have some visited array
 DustinNunyo: Well yeah, but this is an educational project. I plan to implement BFS but only after I have done DFS.
 DustinNunyo: I updated the code with a "visited" array but then I started thinking that I might be over-engeering things by using 3 arrays.
 Scarfield: visited array and DFS will not find the shortest path, the DFS approach will likely "cut off" a shorter path, a BFS with visited array would have found
 jacek: pathfield
 theGrandInquisitor: hi developers
 Scarfield: hi
 AliAhmed115: is clash of code too hard for someone with very little knowledge in python?
 Mindarius: you can use any language in the list for clash of code
 Mindarius: shortest is hard without knowledge of a shorter language. Usually python, JS, Ruby, or somethimes Perl
 IvesL: @Aliahmed115 no
 IvesL: i started there
 Mindarius: reverse and fastest are usually equal between languages
 IvesL: clash of codes are meant to be solved in a couple of minutes
 IvesL: so it wont be too difficult
 Mindarius: Yes, this is true, I meant to win shortest, to simply complete it you should be fine with whatever language you know
 IvesL: oh
 IvesL: spring challenge is back

 eulerscheZahl: i use VS Code for pretty much everything now
 IvesL: i used to use those two when i started learning

 Manchi_o6o7: Struggling to fix it :rolling_eyes:
 Lovemachine: does it require much effort to solve Mars Lander - Episode 2
 Lovemachine: or am i too stupid
 5DN1L: It requires more effort than Episode 1 for sure.
 Lovemachine: i'm thinking about, in theory i know what to do but the math and programming is so much
 Lovemachine: for instance, i need to maintain my Y position meanwhile acceleration in X and also calculate when i should start rotating otherwise to slowdown myself in X axis
 Lovemachine: i think i just suck at math
 Lovemachine: just as i suck everything in life
 5DN1L: You can try other puzzles :shrug:
 5DN1L: Not being able to solve it now doesn't necessarily mean you can't solve it for ever
 Lovemachine: for the instance i just explained;first of all, i need to calculate in how much time i can 0 my X speed. Then multiply that time by my speed to find the distance when i should start slowing. If i'm in distance, i start slowing
 Lovemachine: i can solve the puzzle but it feels like its a lot of work. people solve easy puzzles in a few lines of codes meanwhile i write an article of code
 mesu7: ahahahha
 mesu7: same
 Lovemachine: and i do it like in 7-8 minutes what they do in 3 minutes
 Lovemachine: i think i will stick to web programming XD
 5DN1L: How do you know others do in 3 minutes? Maybe some people do in 3 weeks?
 Lovemachine: clash of code
 5DN1L: oh that
 5DN1L: practice will help you speed up
 5DN1L: you need to practise more to get more familiar
 Lovemachine: can i see solutions to a puzzle before solving it?
 5DN1L: nope, at least normally not
 VirtualRealityRocks: sometimes if you get lucky you can find something on github in your language&#160;;)
 VirtualRealityRocks: don't cheat though
 5DN1L: if you google a solution then it's completely another matter...
 Lovemachine: i want to see. if it is as much of a hardwork i think it is, i'm gonna go ahead. but if'm too stupid and there are much easier ways to solve it, then i'm gonna pass.
 Lovemachine: ok. i'll google it
 VirtualRealityRocks: Just to get an idea of how long your code would have to be. Googling it doesn't mean you copy and paste necesarily
 Lovemachine: Looking at other's code. it seems the speed and stuff doesn't have to be optimal. I guess i was overthinking and was trying to create the best algorithm.
 Lovemachine: I suppose trying to solve the test cases in order is the easier, and faster option
 Lovemachine: Even though is far from the best xd
 5DN1L: It never hurts to do better than the minimum requirements, but finish the minimum requirements first&#160;:)
 InstantWin: 343 Legends in spring challenge? I missed the second part of it due to work, what happened there

 ToeKnife: how can i print the highest value in a range if the range is a single integer? python
 5DN1L: max of that range?
 ToeKnife: it says integer object not iterable when i try to use max
 ToeKnife: thank you though
 Tuo: single integer is not really a range :D
 5DN1L: ^
 ToeKnife: it can be a while true loop right?
 ToeKnife: like while truefor i in range(10)
 5DN1L: integer is integer, range is range, loop is loop
 5DN1L: not sure how one can be another
 ToeKnife: yeah i understand 
 Tuo: max() function needs something like a list to work
 Tuo: doing max(i) on your example will give an error
 j4at: max() needs an iterable or multiple args
 5DN1L: why do you need to apply max to a single integer anyway? :sweat_smile:
 j4at: max(a,b) is valid max(a) is not
 ToeKnife: i get what you are saying 5DN1L
 ToeKnife: and thank you j4at
 5DN1L: you can apply max to e.g. a list. and it works even if that list contains a single integer
 5DN1L: a list or a set or a tuple for that matter
 j4at: Are you trying to max(*range)&#160;? and you have a special case where range is 1 element&#160;? if yes then do max(range) instead. (where range is an iterable)
 5DN1L: basically a container of variable size
 5DN1L: except zero
 Tuo: to actually do max of range you need to do something like thisi = range(10)max(i)
 Tuo: not i in range()
 j4at: or just do i-1
 j4at: :D
 5DN1L: yup&#160;:)
 ToeKnife: thanks for your help but I have to go now
 jacek: stupid discretization. i was doing negative thrust and was wondering why it cant learn

 gustavofurquim: didnt work
 VirtualRealityRocks: Really?
 gustavofurquim: yeah&#160;:/

 DustinNunyo: Well, not and maintain readability anyway. lol
 ycsvenom: then i don't think you are writing it in pythonic way
 ycsvenom: i will read your code and check for shortings
 ycsvenom: what was the name of the puzzle again DustinNunyo?
 DustinNunyo: death first search
 ycsvenom: death or depth??
 DustinNunyo: death

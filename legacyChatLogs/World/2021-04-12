 kiwijam: Hi all, my Quest Map tells me to get to the top 2% of the Code Golf leaderboard. Does anybody know where I can find the formula for how the CPs are calculated? For example, I'm improving my worst score but I suspect only the best 3 count?
 Uljahn: there is clickable question mark on the ranking frame of your profile page
 Uljahn: "Only your top 5 languages submissions will be taken into account."

 i1rr: hey guys, could you help a newbie please&#160;?:) I am always having that message about my inputs and that not all of them were read
 i1rr: however I am doing good agains the bot
 Uljahn: this warning can be ignored then
 struct: hmmm, the bot can be doing good but you might not be reading all inputs
 struct: are you sure you are not outputing twice in the same turn
 struct: or outputing before reading every input?
 i1rr: that is a good point.. probably you right, I created a method for BOOST and that apparently caused the issue coz ran in same turn.. thx

 Smelty: csb

 Wontonimo: i'd take a look if you used a secure sharing site
 Smelty: like?
 Wokarol: Hey, basic noob question. Is there a way to get list of solved puzzles?
 Smelty: just look in your puzzles section
 jacek: at the bottom
 Smelty: any puzzles you solved for that difficulty will appear in solved
 Andriamanitra: @Hellfire91 try something like 'c' as u32
 Wontonimo: Smelty you should be able to just paste a large block of code in the chat and CG will auto generate a link instead of showing all your text
 Smelty: oh okay

 Smelty: just ones like 233
 Smelty: 289
 jacek: impossibru
 Hellfire91: @Andriamanitra thank you, I discovered that my loop condition was not good&#160;:)
 Smelty: and like even if my distance equation is off the way the if/else is is designed so that you can't get over 200
 Smelty: which is why I am confused right now
 Wontonimo: Smelty - have you added a debug before to see what distance generates your weird thrust?
 Smelty: hmm let me see

 groksula: I crumble under pressure, I'm trying to find something to blame my incompetence on
 therealbeef: you'll get used to those little details in the problem statements
 Gortax: if we're talking clas of code, then yeah, the more you do it, the less of a problem it is, once you get more used to it, it's about finishing fast rather than just finishing the tasks
 Gortax: also, I haven't been in here in years, hello c:

 JLukeSkywalker: they roll them all into perma after the contests
 JLukeSkywalker: and yes, still busy with work, but close to the next release
 Astrobytes: Cool, good to hear  :)
 LDami: Hey, in Spring challenge, I don't understand why: "Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move:"
 KiwiTae: LDami if u use other abilities u dont move
 KiwiTae: they don't move *
 LDami: So if 1 Pac used his ability, all the others cannot move&#160;?
 LDami: is using *
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't see this sentence in the statement...
 Astrobytes: "I don't see this sentence in the statement..." I can't see that sentence in the statement either :P
 LDami: Me neither, do I misunderstanding this sentence&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: :expressionless:
 KiwiTae: no
 Astrobytes: 1. I was extracting the Michael from Blaise.2. I can't remember. Or maybe it's a PTSD thing. I didn't like that game.
 LDami: I'm french I'm not trolling you ahah
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm french too, don't see the link.
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 Astrobytes: No, I'm trolling Blaise
 Astrobytes: How did the French thing come into it
 KiwiTae: LDami each pac got its own behaviors
 LDami: Bruh, I should probably view the profile of the person I'm talking to ahah
 KiwiTae: I was french too at some point ah
 BlaiseEbuth: You're not a troll you are a cat, stay at your place.
 Astrobytes: Everyone is French inside.
 KiwiTae: :joy: french is so romantic
 BlaiseEbuth: Nvm. Where do you read this information LDami&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Seriously though, as Kiwo here said the pacmen's behaviours are unique to each pacman
 LDami: KiwiTae this is why I don't understand the error in my logs. This error says that the Pac who didn't used his ability cannot mobe
 LDami: move
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok that's an error msg.
 LDami: "RÃ©sumÃ© du jeu&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68d20008-ed74-460c-873f-359c063688c4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68d20008-ed74-460c-873f-359c063688c4</a>

 LDami: Move 29
 LDami: Oh, maybe :thinking:
 KiwiTae: didnt they move toward the direction on the sortest path or smth
 LDami: I'm looking for the closest pellet so, not impossible
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not abug
 BlaiseEbuth: It's because turns are splitted in replays
 Astrobytes: Yeah, SPEED lets you move 2, otherwise it's only 1
 LDami: I go to bronze with this so .. ^^
 LDami: So I must build the path to the next pellet by myself&#160;?
 Astrobytes: BFS all the way
 BlaiseEbuth: Turn 29 is not a complete turn, only the second part of turn 28, so only the speeded pacs do the second part of their moves
 Astrobytes: And cry at the fog of war.
 Altair-POD: hello
 LDami: there is splitted turns&#160;? omg
 Astrobytes: in the viewer replays 
 BlaiseEbuth: Just for display
 LDami: okay
 BlaiseEbuth: If you look there's no player command in turn 29
 LDami: OH, so "Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move:" is a message to indicate that is a "display only turn", right&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah
 LDami: okaayyyy
 LDami: Thanks :D
 Astrobytes: It's a silly game anyway. Play something else. Also, ignore me. I'm bitter :P
 BlaiseEbuth: faster stronger
 Astrobytes: lol
 Altair-POD: I am really good at clash what to do?
 Astrobytes: Quit and do bot programming

 BlaiseEbuth: Nope. I just pushed a -3v a few years ago, and it is gold since.
 Astrobytes: Well you did the SLCC thing OK so do that!
 struct: do it with avx for extra difficulty 
 struct: or if you like pain
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, i will adapt my simu fom slcc. Just wanted to try something simple before.
 Astrobytes: It can be done with just maths and the right formulae but sim + search is much more relaxing :D
 Wontonimo: oh, if you've got the sim from slcc then DO THAT!
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: have you tried BR yet?

 Wontonimo: add more levels, i don't see the problem.
 Wontonimo: oh well ... some people don't like difficult.  I get it though, what sucked me into this site was the initial low hanging fruit
 Astrobytes: Now we're getting into the 5% territory. Not a conversation I wanna have right now :D
 Wontonimo: 5%&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what do mean?
 Westicles: You won't get internet points for BR though.

 Wontonimo: nothing too complicated even, just enough to simulate the physics of your lead bot hitting the next checkpoint if they were to target the next checkpoint

 Smelty: hmm..
 UnnamedCodinGamer: interesting question I would go for invented
 UnnamedCodinGamer: math seems to me a human invention
 Westicles: Hmmm.  They always assume aliens will recognize prime numbers...
 Smelty: xD
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what if they are alien plants?
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 Westicles: They=television and movies I guess
 UnnamedCodinGamer: who knows
 Westicles: I don't see a bunch of plants who don't know math building spaceships or radios :P
 UnnamedCodinGamer: maybe they do not need them to project themselves in space
 Smelty: uh oh, looks like my fibonacci number generator fails at large numbers: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/kwd9s1.jpg">https://snipboard.io/kwd9s1.jpg</a>
 therealbeef: integer overrun?
 therealbeef: try using long
 Westicles: They might have to smoke themselves first
 Smelty: probably
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I was thinking more generally of aliens
 UnnamedCodinGamer: It seems to me that the pop culture depiction of alien life is pretty limited
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/1NFLo7.jpg">https://snipboard.io/1NFLo7.jpg</a>
 Westicles: yeah.  all made of baryonic matter, for the most part
 Smelty: it appears my first error appears around 46600466103755303097540113804746346429
 Westicles: Give or take the occasional photino bird
 Smelty: hmm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is a vast generalization, most of the tv aliens are actually humanoid
 UnnamedCodinGamer: which is ridiculous if you consider how different planets can be
 Smelty: true
 Westicles: Oh, I don't know.  panspermia always seemed reasonable to me
 KiwiTae: its not that ridiculous
 UnnamedCodinGamer: where is the contradiction?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you can have equal starting material which can evolve in a million ways depending on the conditions
 Smelty: ^^
 KiwiTae: until you show me non-humanoid aliens, seems that humanoid is the way
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 Smelty: heh
 Westicles: Most likely life is just super rare, and we are all there is within our light cone
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I would agree with you if the universe consisted of the solar system, but then again I would not be 100% sure

 MrFruit: After I looked at the saved array, dang that number is huge
 Westicles: I was surprised, I tried using the gmp built-in function for that problem and it timed out
 MrFruit: I am using python
 MrFruit: I did some hacky things
 MrFruit: such as setting the recursion limit to wayyyyy higher than it should be

 Smelty: *edit: its very hard
 EdwinZ: :laughing:
 Westicles: I need to get back to that one.  Got to 63% and gave up, but should be able to tweak it

 KiwiTae: MrFruit hope u using some math tricks no need tocheck the sum
 KiwiTae: oh wait
 KiwiTae: i need to read the puzzle lol
 struct: ZarthaxX you here?
 ThatGuyRadnii: Hey is there a more interactive way to learn other than the articles? I love the challenges for languages I know, but I haven't come across many exercises for learning

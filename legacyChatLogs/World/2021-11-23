 DialFrost: there's a full 38 lines of input reading
 DialFrost:&#160;:&gt;
 Uljahn: i read them 7 times at least and everytime get something new
 DialFrost: see derjack even the mod reads em

 Almin5k: remember failures are essential if you are going to push forward
 KRALLEE: WTF DONT MAKE FUN 
 Almin5k:&#160;?
 n0b1e: Yes its true embrace failure
 KRALLEE: lmao i  never fail only dubs  wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
 derjack: replace coffee with tea. less caffeine, some l-theanine
 n0b1e: ^^ thanks for the advice&#160;:)
 DirectorJax: @n0b1e&#160;: black tea, but that too, in moderation.&#160;:) also as less sugar as possible. preferably without.
 n0b1e: yeah true! the sugar crashes are horrible
 DirectorJax: and a good addition to that, try to exercise a bit. tonifies the body and you won't get fatigued as easily.
 DirectorJax: plus much better sleep
 C26_1: um
 n0b1e: Sleep is too important ive learnt that the hard way lolz
 C26_1: Can I make a puzzle
 C26_1: I don't know how to do that
 C26_1: Especially the stub input part

 struct: do you want to create a puzzle with graphics?
 struct: or just a normal puzzle?
 karlo.ks: how do I convert a number into a solid integer?
 karlo.ks: thats a number that doesnt contain 0 in it. Like 10 has 0 so it is not 10 it would be 11
 karlo.ks: I need a mathematical formula for that
 5DN1L: You have to solve the puzzle yourself
 karlo.ks: bruh I dont know how to mathematically define that
 derjack: could changing to base9 help it?
 n0b1e: ^ +
 karlo.ks: tried it, for number 99 it gives me an output of 120 which is not valid
 5DN1L: If you don't know the mathematical way to do it at first, please list out the initial solid integers one by one
 5DN1L: Work out a pattern from that
 5DN1L: I solved it without considering any base conversion at all (although the code eventually was similar to base conversion)
 n0b1e: its a tough one karlo keep going, but you dont need base 9 just understand the concept
 5DN1L: ^ yes and that
 gun_lnwza: I had a pretty rough idea for the algorithm, but I find it very hard to solidify it. Any suggestion?
 5DN1L: think about how many solid integers are 1-digit, how many are 2-digit, how many are 3-digit, and so on
 5DN1L: Work out a pattern
 gun_lnwza: yeah, combinatoric stuffs
 5DN1L: yes exactly
 n0b1e: took me so long to figure it out without using base 9 explicitly 
 DialFrost: y doesnt this work for the descent
 DialFrost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d33042d5-4dcf-46f1-8d5e-730ec299e087">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d33042d5-4dcf-46f1-8d5e-730ec299e087</a>
 5DN1L: Because the size of the list is supposed to remain constant
 C26_1: @struct
 5DN1L: DialFrost Also, your loop loops too many times
 C26_1: How can I make a puzzle with more than 2 part?
 dreamTwo: drew drew
 struct: more than 2 parts?
 C26_1: yes
 struct: like 2 different puzzles?
 C26_1: for example
 C26_1: I make a part name "Password Generate From Text"
 C26_1: Then after you complete that part
 C26_1: then It'll transfer you to a part name "Decrypt the text from number"
 derjack: more test cases?
 struct: well you can either make 2 puzzles or make the player output both answers
 struct: on the same puzzle
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: &lt;&lt;Line 1:&gt;&gt;
 C26_1: @struct, which kind of style do you prefer
 C26_1: &lt;&lt;Line 1&gt;&gt;:    or       &lt;&lt;Line 1: &gt;&gt;
 struct: probably 2nd
 C26_1: ok
 derjack: clashobytes
 kimsejin123: gimozzi
 Merfi: ok
 kimsejin123: thank you
 GreatStopwatch_f89: no
 GreatStopwatch_f89: mu
 C26_1: um wait
 C26_1: Can puzzle has no code solution
 C26_1: Because different programming language has their own way to make an anwser and therefore more perspective to the puzzle
 C26_1: And how do I know if my anwser is the best. There could be a programming language that could run faster and more readable than mine
 5DN1L: I believe you can't submit a contribution without a solution
 C26_1: oh
 C26_1: okay
 5DN1L: And your answer doesn't have to be the best. But your puzzle statement and the test cases must be consistent
 C26_1: ah
 C26_1: Thank you @5DN1L
 5DN1L: You're welcome

 Kokoz: hello all&#160;:)
 Noshiro: Heyo
 Kokoz: watchu doing?
 Noshiro: I'm trying to find out how to do coding :P
 GamingGnawer: find a cat and try to get it to walk on the keybiard!Then hit compile until it works!
 Noshiro: Makes sense I'll do that!
 Bjorm: thats pretty accurate
 Kokoz: hehehe.. tried it, doesnt work
 Noshiro: Oof
 Kokoz: Im learning how to code too.. Been doing this for half an year now
 Kokoz: what language you choose?
 <b>**Uljahn walks on the keyboard, it's super effective!</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: at how many keys per minute can you walk?
 Kokoz: xD
 Kokoz: I guess all of them at once :D
 eulerscheZahl: what language have you been using for the half year that you've tried already?
 Kokoz: python.. I was told it is easy and noob friendly
 eulerscheZahl: and do you already feel comfortable with it?
 Kokoz: kind of.. still trying to figure "self" in OOP but Im getting closer
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like some more time with python wouldn't harm then.any plans on what to code? e.g. you could look into web development with django or flask (both are python frameworks)
 Uljahn: also consider learning numpy, the best python tool to deal with arrays
 Kokoz: yea, basically I want to get familiar with programming itself.. Mostly with OOP. But I try to get into flask, kivy and pygame. And recently I found out about ursina. So yea.. All of that XD
 eulerscheZahl: ursina? sounds like a small bear
 Kokoz: Ive trained with numpy a couple of times. I know its power
 Kokoz: Ursina is a 3d engine. Like pygame but 3d
 Kokoz: what language/s are you using?
 Uljahn: hover over avatars to trigger the pop-up
 Uljahn: i guess to grasp "self" in python you should understand mutability and object referencing, also you can start from dataclasses, which are very close to named tuples
 Kokoz: I kinda get the idea if "self" but I need more practice to get used to it..
 Kokoz: of "self"*
 KalamariKing: question, does it *have* to be "self" or can you use "this" as the first argument
 Kokoz: You can name it however you want
 Kokoz: it is not a keyword
 Uljahn: it have to be self to be less confusing to people who will read your code
 5DN1L: so theoretically no, practically yes
 Kokoz: exactly
 Kokoz: it is socially accepted (if I can call it like that) to be "self", but it is just a vairable..
 Westicles: self isn't a keyword?  it turns blue in my dawg solution
 Uljahn: there are plenty of informal naming conventions in python which are not part of PEP8
 Westicles: huh, you are right.  replace-all with this still works
 Uljahn: also according to PEP8 "Always use self for the first argument to instance methods."
 Uljahn: i think the Zen of python and PEP8 are things you should learn first to form right mindset and good habits
 Flowerbear: i wish haxe support was available for this
 KennelCodeurPython: hey i'm kennel from ivory coast

 Westicles: Obama played 333 rounds of golf during his presidency, or 1665 hours out of his 55,000 hours as president
 Astrobytes: Oh it's a single league that game
 eulerscheZahl: am I doing the math wrong? Obama was president for 8 years
 eulerscheZahl: 365.25*24*870128
 struct: he is not a president while he is sleeping
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Westicles: yes, wontonimo is in charge while he sleeps
 eulerscheZahl: so wontonimo has to work harder under the reign of Sleepy Joe?
 Westicles: Ha, is that what they call him?  I stopped paying attention to politics after Reagan
 Westicles: meanwhile, scrabble is still scrabble.  they are actually known to sue over this stuff

 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Oh... You were not trolling...
 Wontonimo: there isn't anything in the landing page to promote their use or bring stuff to your attention that may be related to what you do

 Wontonimo: 5DN1L you idea is solid imo.  Getting people to navigate to it and see it would be a great way of introducing it
 5DN1L: Although forum isn't part of the quest map, it's featured in the achievements
 5DN1L: "Get 3/5/10/50/100 likes or more on your total forum posts"
 5DN1L: Maybe the quest map is more eyecatching and easier to follow than the achievements

 Astrobytes: Hmm. Not watched a lot recently. I can't quite match that one for intensity, it was unreal
 jacek: my little pony, the movie
 Astrobytes: Passing is quite excellent.
 Scarfield: passing is on netflix, justwatch.com is gold
 Astrobytes: Not sure I watched anything new other than that.
 Scarfield: doesnt have to be new, just cant decide what to watch tonight
 vaeng: Dark City?
 vaeng: 13th Floor?
 Astrobytes: I've just been revisiting old stuff like 2001, some Star Trek movies, Alien etc
 Wontonimo: the wire
 Scarfield: havent seen dark city, but imdb says "others like this": equilibrium, k-pax, gattaca. looks nice&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ooooh I recently watched Gattaca again, love that 
 Astrobytes: I think I know Dark City but I don't recall the details
 Scarfield: yea gattaca is great
 jacek: snatch
 Scarfield: seriously watched snatch yesterday
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: lock stock and 2 smoking barrels 
 Scarfield: thats a nice one as well, guy ritchyie had some nice movies
 Astrobytes: Sexy Beast is a good one if you like that kinda stuff
 Astrobytes: lock stock lol, chill Winston
 Scarfield: you liked sexy beast?
 Astrobytes: Yeah great movie
 Astrobytes: Try The Long Good Friday too, bit older but excellent
 Scarfield: saw it the other day, and thought it was nice untill the last 20 minutes, im not sure why, but the end just ruined it for me
 Astrobytes: There's Layer Cake, I wasn't keen on that
 vaeng: Dark City is a movie that I think about pretty often
 Scarfield: yea layer cake was ok, matthew vaughn was one of my go to directors before he was outed as a "not great guy"
 vaeng: The last-thursdayism concept is mind bbending
 Scarfield: yea great suggestion, definately gonna watch that, its just not available on netflix or hbo&#160;:(
 vaeng: you could watch something strange like that belgium mockumentary about these killers for hire
 jacek: try torrents. yaar
 Astrobytes: ^
 Scarfield: meh
 Astrobytes: trybeforebuy
 Astrobytes: lol
 vaeng: streaming works better, where torrenting is followed by heavy fines
 Astrobytes: Also, Trainspotting 1 &amp; 2, Shallow Grave
 Scarfield: trainspotting, havent seen that in 10 years or something. there is a sequal? :o
 Astrobytes: Yeah T2 it's referred to as (not to be confused with Judgement Day ofc)
 Astrobytes: and it's awesome
 Astrobytes: Shallow Grave is excellent also (Danny Boyle, Ewan McGregor, Ken Stott, Christopher Eccleston...)
 Scarfield: its from 2017, had no idea, NICE
 Scarfield: Terminator 2 wouldnt be a bad choice anyway, think i have it somewhere
 Astrobytes: yeah, quality action movie
 Scarfield: for sure, and im an schwarzenegger fanboy xD
 Astrobytes: Predator was great, and honourable mention to Commando
 Scarfield: i have commando on blueray xD
 Astrobytes: Fanboy eh: "I am the party pooper" name that movie
 Astrobytes: no googling

 eulerscheZahl: will you MadKnight?
 eulerscheZahl: always telling others to play but skipping them yourself
 MadKnight: yea maybe ye for this one
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even remember if you are a strong player
 struct: He needs physics contest
 MadKnight: cmon struct
 struct: yes?
 MadKnight: cmon
 MadKnight: are u now gonna reference everything to csb&#160;?
 struct: Its the game you seem to enjoy the most
 MadKnight: no it was the first game where i tried to use simu 
 MadKnight: and i wanted more people to train my GA against
 MadKnight: no need to make a thing out of that
 KiwiTae: I might , just got injured so my season is off, more time for coding
 KiwiTae: MadKnight i would try using Kotlin &gt;,&lt; might not get out of woodi , still struggling with it
 MadKnight: improve your kotlin skills faster
 LelouchVC2: Improve your c++ skills
 thibpat: I'm streaming my progress on Twixt-PP, yesterday we optimized the code and were able to increase the depth of the negamax... without seeing an improvement in our strategy.

 MadKnight: what is that code KiwiTae&#160;?
 MadKnight: and why are u getting trolled by sharedptr
 KiwiTae: MadKnight xboxlive sdk for UE4 hehe
 KiwiTae: cause I am tracking an issue theres like stuff happening on xboxlive that i dont get how and i think its because i dont reset some ptrs

 Illedan: ye
 Illedan: but you don't need bfs since there are no islands..

 WINWINWIN: Can the owner of this repository please remove this? there are too many java bots that function similarly
 Astrobytes: Copy-pasters gonna copy-paste&#160;:/
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:( I`m stuck in silver and was going through top guys replays
 WINWINWIN: 20 draws!
 Shakib.M83: Hello
 WINWINWIN: Hi
 Shakib.M83: I'm Shakib
 wlesavo: WINWINWIN by posting the link you will probably make it worse
 Shakib.M83: what's your name?
 WINWINWIN: Sorry&#160;:(
 WINWINWIN: in gold yet wlesavo?
 WINWINWIN: worst thing about that link is that he has some how gotten a hold of magus, pb4 and ranarama1s codes!
 wlesavo: no, pushed a boss to far, and one more guy to gold :slight_smile: some improvemnts though, maybe ill finally make it
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: I gave up on heuristics, not getting anywhere
 wlesavo: id gave up on my bot rather than on heuristics :slight_smile:
 Nerchio: crystal rush description is very confusing
 Nerchio: entityCount says about entities currently visible to you and then they say that 2: one of your buried radars
 Nerchio: so i can see enemy radars or not/
 blasterpoard: you can't
 blasterpoard: only your radars
 Nerchio: so i can only see a hole not whats inside then
 blasterpoard: yes
 Nerchio: ok ty
 blasterpoard: a big part of the bot is trying to figure out what the opponent actually did
 RoboStac: the other big part is trying to make it look like you did something when you didn't
 Nerchio: so far i am in silver i just made my robots mine efficiently
 Nerchio: and i started blowing up on mines against silver opponents
 blasterpoard: have you encountered the mine walls yet?
 blasterpoard: or is that gold
 Nerchio: not yet
 Nerchio: people trying to do chain explosions? :D
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456150683">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456150683</a> this stuff
 blasterpoard: usually at x=1
 Nerchio: so i can't see opponent bots either if they are not in radar range?
 blasterpoard: you can see them, but not their inventory
 Nerchio: kk
 Nerchio: the description could be more clear :p
 blasterpoard: to get to legend, you only need to place some mines at the start of the game, be extremely paranoid about opponent's mines, and then "protect" ore by pretending you put a mine on it
 Nerchio: so initially there is no 'hole' on ore before you mine it or put something on it
 blasterpoard: yes
 Nerchio: ah so it makes sense to mine couple of ores before actually returning anything to just to make holes
 Nerchio: but people in silver probably still ignore that :D
 blasterpoard: no, just wait 1 turn at spawn, and then go dig a cell that has 2+ore
 blasterpoard: opponent can't dig it, because there could be a mine
 Nerchio: got it
 blasterpoard: so you collect it later
 Nerchio: but wait to undig a mine you need to kill your bot?
 blasterpoard: no, there is actually no mine on that square
 blasterpoard: you just make the opponent think there is one
 Nerchio: ah ok :p
 Illedan: If you want to code it easier, just always get a radar when you can. And place it on a 2+ ore if you dont need more vision. Then fetch radar ores at the end
 MSmits: tricksy
 blasterpoard: except there are many bots that think you pick up radar whenever you can, and then they assume the squares they dug are safe to dig
 Illedan: w00t
 Illedan: :rocket:
 Illedan: top 10 now MSmits
 Nerchio: where?
 Illedan: FB gold
 MSmits: gj Illedan
 Illedan: Still 2 points below the boss at 60&#160;%&#160;:(
 MSmits: ah well, you'll get there
 Illedan: Yeah, now I just need to find that 1 eval param to tweak :P
 Illedan: 7-2 vs the boss is promising though
 wlesavo: i was above the silver boss but got a heavy lose streak, damn
 wlesavo: 0.04 points below :expressionless:
 wlesavo: WINWINWIN can you submit a couple of times to get a game against me? :smiley:
 MSmits: yay finally finished last assignment for my class: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/o0GdpmQ">https://imgur.com/a/o0GdpmQ</a>
 MSmits: crossword puzzle generator works
 wlesavo: now you need to write a solver
 MSmits: nah, now I need to check out the stuff they omitted from the class due to time restrictions. Because it is about learning and neural networks
 wlesavo: i remember some things like that in '00s you type some known letters and a programm filters its dictionary based on the input 
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: not sure what kind of assignments this has
 wlesavo: ok, finaly, easy FB gold
 WINWINWIN: How`d u do it wlesavo? is a heuristic enough?
 MadKnight: hey MSmits i kind of got afkw

 MadKnight: oh no Automaton2000 it's a trap!
 Automaton2000: u need a ga for csb
 MadKnight: that's right Automaton2000 but i'm talking about the link Automaton2000 - don't click it Automaton2000 u're gonna end yourself in a clash
 Automaton2000: if i worked on it for a couple of months ago
 MadKnight: end up getting in a clash*
 MadKnight: when is the contest starting Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: how would i do that
 MadKnight: what's the exact date Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: its time to do it in 1 line
 eulerscheZahl: the topcoder website is weird, greeting me with some new rubbish every day when it fails to load
 MadKnight: today's the last day of april Automaton2000

 Illedan: What is that eulerscheZahl? 
 eulerscheZahl: showing me the login page, logging me in, loading the page again until infinity
 FireFeathers: hi
 Astrobytes: Strange
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder had an optim contest recently Illedan
 Illedan: :O
 Illedan: How long lasting?
 Illedan: done?

 eulerscheZahl: done, 7 days
 eulerscheZahl: you rotate a subsquare
 MadKnight: they've been hacked Automaton2000 don't believe eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: and try to arrange the numbers that way
 Automaton2000: like if you have a lot of my time
 wlesavo: WINWINWIN yes, apparently, just choosed a version that is good against boss, not sure it was best one overall, but pushed boss quite low
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Illedan: looks fun
 Illedan: did you join?
 eulerscheZahl: was fun even if i failed in the end
 eulerscheZahl: 16th before rerun with more testsets
 WINWINWIN: Yeah boss is at its lowest
 wlesavo: dbdr yes, but have to wait for 2 hours
 eulerscheZahl: psyho is the clear winner
 eulerscheZahl: the one you might know from halite
 Illedan: k
 dbdr: well done! take a break&#160;;)
 Illedan: Let me know next time there is something fun happening in the world :D
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i will
 eulerscheZahl: and if i'm not sure if it is?
 dbdr: Illedan there's something fun happening in the world right now
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://azspcs.com/Contest/SumsOfPowers">http://azspcs.com/Contest/SumsOfPowers</a>i won't join there
 Illedan: Optim or bot only :P
 Illedan: With prizes and a timer
 dbdr: so specific
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the first prize was $0 for the squares rotation
 Illedan: I never win anyway
 Illedan: sooo, just a timer is enough
 Illedan: xD
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/launch?iso=20200508T18&amp;p0=50&amp;font=cursive">https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/launch?iso=20200508T18&amp;p0=50&amp;font=cursive</a>
 eulerscheZahl: what's that counting to?
 dbdr: guess
 eulerscheZahl: no idea. 24h after CG contest start?
 dbdr: but could be anything, Illedan just wanted a timer to have fun
 wlesavo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: so, what is it?
 dbdr: doesn't the contest start on a friday as usual?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 dbdr: :O
 eulerscheZahl: fail
 dbdr: heresy!
 eulerscheZahl: 11 days this time
 eulerscheZahl: they even did it wrong in the trailer
 dbdr: :D
 wlesavo: thats a marketing, 11 days sounds weird :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: coding contest sounds weird
 wlesavo: hm, thats also true
 dbdr: property testing is awesome!
 dbdr: my world just changed&#160;:)
 wlesavo: what do you use it for?
 dbdr: automatically finding the minimal input that makes a test fail
 dbdr: or if it does not find, having some reasonable confidence that your code passes the test because it has been tested on thousands of random inputs
 wlesavo: i mean what problem?
 dbdr: right now?
 wlesavo: yes
 dbdr: testing my model of twixt-pp&#160;:)
 wlesavo: hm, sounds interesting
 eulerscheZahl: i do that random testing in codejam-like problems sometimes
 wlesavo: i wanted to do something simmilar
 eulerscheZahl: when my code crashes on submit of if i have a bruteforce solver (too slow) and a faster one with wrong answer
 dbdr: does is also finds the minimal example?
 eulerscheZahl: codejam 1C this weekend btw
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if minimal but i try to generate small testcases of course
 eulerscheZahl: try an input with 5 numbers to hope for crashes before increasing to 100
 dbdr: the idea here is it tries to find any input that fails, then it starts to simplify that input while keeping the failure
 wlesavo: wow
 dbdr: there is a nice basic example here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/getting-started.html">https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/getting-started.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i see. interesting approach
 dbdr: and it can work with any type
 eulerscheZahl: makes it easier to trace the source of the failing
 eulerscheZahl: but you need a way to detect the failure ofc
 dbdr: you can say pairs of integers in a certain range, etc
 dbdr: but here I had to define a Tree structure
 dbdr: and the system automatically understands it, and will see if a subtree also makes the test fail
 dbdr: it fells like magic&#160;:)
 dbdr: indeed. you still need to write the test
 dbdr: it helps it you have debug assertions in your code, then you can already get feedback if they ever fail
 dbdr: now I was not testing that I get a specific answer, just that a certain property is true at the end, which should always be true
 wlesavo: how you generaly handling input() in unit test? wraping input in function and paching that function  or there is more simple way?
 dbdr: I already knew it can be false, but the case I had had 250 recursive calls into my function, so would be fun to debug... :D
 Nullergoj: that is the way to do it
 Nullergoj: Creating an adapter class
 dbdr: after making a model of my function calls, the system found a case for me with only 3 calls&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: in some languages the recursion limit would have killed you at that point already
 dbdr: wlesavo I would not use input() inside a test. I would pass the input to the test as a parameter
 dbdr: it was not 250 deep
 dbdr: it was 250 calls in total, in in out in in out out in ... etc
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 dbdr: a single parent call
 dbdr: the function being minimax, and modifying my state recursively
 wlesavo: hm, nice
 IjustKilledutoo: hello
 IAmNoob: hi

 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl u're better at that
 MadKnight: help him
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)

 darkhorse64: MadKnight: it's your job to say the magic formula
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl while u're depressed u can still help noobs
 reCurse: MK not jumping at the opportunity of saying -3*vel and GA?
 reCurse: Who's depressed now? :P
 reCurse: You doing ok?
 MadKnight: u haven't been there when i told that but
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl remembers
 MadKnight: don't make a big deal out of that, CSB was just my first game where i used simus to make a bot and i practiced this approach a lot and i wanted more players to come to rekt them with my new approach, but now my bot is even better and rekting some noobs is boring
 MadKnight: also MSmits and me want to make a really nice techio tutorial on NNs
 MadKnight: so i'm waiting for MSmits to fiinsh with his teaching stuff to have time for our tutorial
 Astrobytes: Who will carry the CSB torch now?
 MadKnight: i know that a fancy MM bot will rek any few-if'ed bot, what's the big deal, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: thats what i am doing the same thing
 MSmits: wait... I agreed on this already MadKnight?
 MSmits: I thought I only said I was going to look into machine learning over the summer :P
 MSmits: not that it's not interesting. I like the idea of a good tech.io tutorial
 IjustKilledutoo: hello plz give me a follow to do pair
 MSmits: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: who's utoo and why i he dead?
 IAmNoob: Yessss!!!!
 IAmNoob: i got top 1
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you even that the 1 at the first and last digit of your rank
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: what is the last digit of your rank IAmNoob&#160;?
 IAmNoob: 7
 Astrobytes: Rank not level
 IAmNoob: 1

 Astrobytes: I know dbdr, sorry :P
 dbdr: no worries&#160;:)
 dbdr: logically, you're pulling the top 2 down more
 Astrobytes: My 'improvements' were nothing of the kinda apparently
 Astrobytes: *kind
 dbdr: kinda improvement
 LoGos: IAmNoob what is this thing?
 Astrobytes: kinda failing more like
 Astrobytes: oh, that's why. Woops
 <b>**Astrobytes is an idiot</b></p><p><img src="/a/43455780661578" /> IAmNoob: topologycal sort?
 LoGos: I know topological sort. What's the thing to clear?
 IAmNoob: isent there a more efficient way to do it
 LoGos: the most efficient way is O(n) if we speak about time complexity.
 IAmNoob: of topological sort?
 LoGos: yeah. Are you using your own algorithm or did you google it?
 eulerscheZahl: O(nodes+edges) actually
 LoGos: yeah, I just wanted to correct myself
 LoGos: what would even n refer to
 eulerscheZahl: a natural number
 LoGos: nvm 
 IAmNoob: thx
 IAmNoob: how can you defeat the boss
 IAmNoob: i defeated
 IAmNoob: him
 IAmNoob: is it not a glitch?
 IAmNoob: is there not a glitch
 IAmNoob: i am still the 10 000'th
 IAmNoob: please someone
 Nerchio: did you use submit.
 IAmNoob: yes
 IAmNoob: sure
 IAmNoob: in the editor
 IAmNoob: i killed boss
 IAmNoob: (defeated)]
 IAmNoob: i hope at the end of precessing i will be at least in top 10
 IAmNoob: processing*
 IAmNoob: if you kill the boss you are upper in the top?
 AntiSquid: click leaderboard
 IAmNoob: ok
 AntiSquid: the search for your name
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: 12 793'th
 AntiSquid: if your rank is &lt; 1 then improve your bot
 IAmNoob: it is way bigger
 IAmNoob: but in the editor i killed the boss
 Uljahn: it doesn't matter much
 AntiSquid: dude are you serious?
 IAmNoob: I?
 IAmNoob: yes
 AntiSquid: get rank 1 . be above the boss
 IAmNoob: cant get rank 1
 IAmNoob: i would not be #1
 AntiSquid: then tough life
 IAmNoob: because is someone that has more
 Uljahn: look through your last battles and learn from your losses
 IAmNoob: I havent really lost
 eulerscheZahl: you must have lost if you aren't 1st
 IAmNoob: i won 1 with the person X and than lost with the person X

 IAmNoob: Da:)
 AntiSquid: si atunci&#160;?
 IAmNoob: Is locu' 100000
 IAmNoob: habar n-am

 eulerscheZahl: stop making up new words AntiSquid
 IAmNoob: dar nu si pe #1
 dbdr: TIL AntiSquid speaks romanian&#160;:)
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: da o data din noroc
 eulerscheZahl: he is from there afaik
 IAmNoob: mereu
 AntiSquid: submit bot again.
 dbdr: TIL AntiSquid is romanian
 eulerscheZahl: his name is Sergiu
 IAmNoob: daca dau in editor si si in meci dar pentru ca am pierdut multe nu ma pune peste bot
 AntiSquid: if you can't beat all bots before that then you can't reach boss
 AntiSquid: was never a secret dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: but he speaks German too
 IAmNoob: I too
 IAmNoob: deutsch sprechen

 stacked: lol
 stacked: you could do cool tricks
 stacked: to advance do you need to beat all other AI's in the league?
 reCurse: You need to bet the top 10 convincingly
 reCurse: *beat
 stacked: what does that mean?
 reCurse: There's no hard rule
 reCurse: You need to finish your submit with a score higher than the boss

 stacked: holy
 fvla: ...but i don't have access to the game source
 stacked: thats genius
 Astrobytes: IfIHadATail Vadim Savin (from the discord streaming channel)
 fvla: so i don't know whether 90 degrees 5 pixels or 90 degrees 500 pixels makes a difference
 fvla: does it?
 stacked: i dont think so
 IfIHadATail: awesome! thanks you so much and I totally forgot that channel existed lol Thanks!!
 stacked: x and y exist for direction solely i thjink
 Astrobytes: No worries
 reCurse: It makes a difference in the sense that you don't get as much precision over the angle if it's close
 fvla: ah, i see
 fvla: that's the only difference
 reCurse: Not that it matters that much
 fvla: that makes sense
 fvla: so 1 pixel away would suck
 stacked: smart
 fvla: i tried a clash of code
 reCurse: It wouldn't suck if you could give a fraction of unit
 reCurse: Then it would be as precise as you'd want
 fvla: yeah, that would be nice
 reCurse: But it's integer so the closer the less precision
 fvla: it was a shortest code contest, and nobody but me submitted a working answer
 fvla: are most clashes like this?
 stacked: no
 stacked: unless ur with bots
 fvla: they were 5 other non-bots
 stacked: or unles the problem is hard
 AntiSquid: those are clashes, contests are longer thankfully
 fvla: bronze league in coders strike back is so restricting
 stacked: y
 fvla: it annoys me that i have to infer certain information (e.g. waypoint locations) that will be available via input in higher leagues
 stacked: what is a waypoing
 stacked: t
 reCurse: Yeah it's a known issue, that's why it didn't happen again with newer games
 reCurse: But can't change without breaking thousands of bots
 fvla: oof
 fvla: oh well
 stacked: whatst a waypoint?
 Astrobytes: Checkpoint
 fvla: checkpoint, rather
 stacked: oh like a list of all checkpoints?
 fvla: okay, time to break out of bronze league
 stacked: fvla wanna play
 stacked: clash
 fvla: sure
 fvla: i knew it, speed is my weakest point
 romrd468: lol in csb my bot now go's after 2 checkpoints at the same time and somehow makes it through them
 romrd468: why does my pods apparently have 2 nextId's
 romrd468: so 1 can equal 1 and 2 at the same time in my code...
 romrd468: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456236949">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456236949</a> next id is listed in output and somehow its flickering
 romrd468: Its fairly entertaining but I do not like it
 Uljahn: then fix your code, it's definitely a bug in it
 romrd468: But I am having an issue on inputs so I guess I will need to start over
 Uljahn: silver bots don't work with gold inputs
 Uljahn: the only way is to use "restore default code" button
 romrd468: I am in gold
 reCurse: Yeah you have to redo inputs in gold
 AntiSquid: best multi for beginners, redo bot in gold
 romrd468: What is the normal range for vx and vy?
 fvla: go into debug mode to find out&#160;:)
 romrd468: am trying to make my own vx and vy and I need to know the bounds because of special cases are a pain
 reCurse: Roughly sqrt(vx*vx+vy*vy) &lt;= 1885
 romrd468: thanks
 romrd468: so the normal way of using vx or vy is what equation?
 reCurse:&#160;?
 Norange: r u using c++?
 romrd468: python
 Norange: oh
 romrd468: and vx*3 is what I heard and it just seems wrong
 Astrobytes: Think about what that does
 romrd468: I dont know what operators to place before it 
 romrd468: I can understand vx*3
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456243168">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456243168</a>
 Nerchio: insane guy&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Well think about what you have to output, and relate that to your velocity
 eulerscheZahl: no more GitC?
 eulerscheZahl: there are other bots that build a whole line of mines
 eulerscheZahl: to kill everyone in a chain explosion
 Nerchio: i know but this one was funny
 Nerchio: 1 bot left :p
 Nerchio: hehe yeah right now i just try to get legend in whatever i play
 Nerchio: not really aiming for high places
 Nerchio: i will focus on high places in 'live' competitions i think
 eulerscheZahl: you got a great timing to start playing CG then
 Nerchio: CG?
 BenjaminUrquhart: my bot is an example of the mine trap
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456243892">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456243892</a>
 eulerscheZahl: CG = codingame
 BenjaminUrquhart: it worked really well for all of a day during the contest
 Nerchio: ah ye&#160;:)
 Nerchio: nice mine trap Benjamin
 eulerscheZahl: but then bots started avoiding your traps
 Nerchio: i am in silver atm so can't deal with it yet
 Nerchio: i turned off my mines actually
 Nerchio: because i was using them on ore
 Nerchio: but that's kind of a waste
 BenjaminUrquhart: the only reason I use mines is so I can avoid having to redo collection :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: take down the enemy with me
 eulerscheZahl: next level is to act like placing a mine on ore
 eulerscheZahl: while you aren't actually
 BenjaminUrquhart: I do that but badly
 eulerscheZahl: but the opponent will think you did. so you can pick it up in the late game
 Nerchio: hmm i actually have no idea how to predict mine/radar/just a hole
 Nerchio: yet*
 eulerscheZahl: you can track if the opponent waited a turn on the baseline
 eulerscheZahl: that's a potential mine but you can't be sure
 Nerchio: ah ye that's nice
 Nerchio: unfortunately i think the description for the contest is not the best
 Nerchio: so i struggled with that a little :p
 eulerscheZahl: what do you miss?
 eulerscheZahl: i think i barely read it, as most was known before the contest already
 eulerscheZahl: thanks to BenjaminUrquhart leaking it
 Nerchio: i think right now its already quite clear
 Nerchio: but it says
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl don't make me find the spring challenge ones
 Nerchio: entityCount for the amount of robots, radars and traps currently visible to you. 
 eulerscheZahl: CG learned from their mistakes
 Nerchio: and then you can't really see opponent traps or radars
 eulerscheZahl: replays are private by default now
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice
 AntiSquid: well we all know it's pacman anyway
 BenjaminUrquhart: hush
 AntiSquid: don't hush me, there's a giant cover image of pacman&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: another way to track: each item has an ID
 eulerscheZahl: so you can observe your own radar IDs
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh yeah that thing
 Nerchio: omg
 Nerchio: that sounds like cheating :D
 eulerscheZahl: and if you get 2 consecutive numbers, no opponent mine :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: but effort
 Nerchio: they should random the IDs then 
 eulerscheZahl: i mentioned that on the chat during the contest, later #2 said it's useless
 Nerchio: to avoid coding the numbers
 eulerscheZahl: then changed his mind, saying it helped a lot
 AntiSquid: that's not fixed yet?
 eulerscheZahl: it's part of the game, isn't it?
 Nerchio: it's a game outside of a game i'd say
 BenjaminUrquhart: metagaming
 AntiSquid: it's basically a bug
 eulerscheZahl: at least only few players realized it and used it to their advantage
 AntiSquid: it was in chat all week, not everyone bothered
 Nerchio: doesn't seem that hard to core
 Nerchio: code*
 eulerscheZahl: and if you want to dig a potential ore cell, do so while an opponent is next to it
 Nerchio: hmm silver is harder than I imagined
 eulerscheZahl: either you trade 1:1 or you have ore
 Nerchio: ye i thought about this already
 Nerchio: not implemented yet :p
 Nerchio: silver so far is hard because if my first radar is worse than opponents i can get behind and lose from then on
 eulerscheZahl: different first radar is what got me to legend in the contest
 BenjaminUrquhart: I got lucky with silver cause almost nobody could deal with the mine traps at that time, so I got high enough to promote :upside_down:
 PortalBot: but wait just because replays are random does that really mean you can't request the data of the replay?
 BenjaminUrquhart: huh?
 PortalBot: i mean private
 eulerscheZahl: and bombing in legend is much less than in gold (and i'm bad at avoiding), so it even was mid-legend
 BenjaminUrquhart: pretty sure it either 404s or 403s
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 403
 BenjaminUrquhart: OupsAn error occurred (#UNAUTHORIZED): "You are not authorised to view replay 456243893".
 ZarthaxX: stop breaking everything apple
 BenjaminUrquhart: [object Object]
 AntiSquid: apple died when steve jobs died
 AntiSquid: change my mind
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's even a 200 OK actually
 reCurse: Apple is just a company with good marketing
 reCurse: Change my mind
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; r&lt;Response [200]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; r.json(){'error': {'code': 'UNAUTHORIZED', 'message': 'You are not authorised to view replay 456243893'}}
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah yes 200
 eulerscheZahl: apple = overpriced hardware and hipster software
 reCurse: Made possible by....
 eulerscheZahl: but still selling a lot, so they have great marketing for sure
 eulerscheZahl: same goes for supreme
 Astrobytes: People were too busy ragging on MS to notice Apple slithering in
 Astrobytes: And Apple products are proof of style over substance.
 AntiSquid: one of the first videos about apple i've seen was an old video about jobs talking about beautiful font ...
 AntiSquid: the devil being in the details 
 romrd468: will it always be Id == 1 at the start of a CSB match?
 reCurse: Yes
 struct: which id?
 struct: chcekpoint?
 struct: pod?
 reCurse: There's only one id in csb
 struct: ah true
 IfIHadATail: using codingame sync how do I get it to auto upload without having to press "Force Upload" everytime?
 reCurse: Did you install both app and extension?
 IfIHadATail: yeah it all works but just wont auto sync
 reCurse: OS? Chrome ver?
 reCurse: Works fine for me
 struct: Which options do you have turned on?
 IfIHadATail: win 10, Google Chrome is up to dateVersion 81.0.4044
 reCurse: Same here...

 reCurse: Try rebooting :upside_down:
 IfIHadATail: I reloaded chrome and Intellij multiple times already are you saying to just reboot the whole comp?
 reCurse: Maybe. I am out of suggestions sorry.
 reCurse: I'm guessing it doesn't receive file system notifications for some reason
 struct: y
 Uljahn: reboot the universe, Automaton2000
 Nerchio: i ctrl+c ctrl+v with intellij much faster :s
 Nerchio: but I didnt try syncing
 Automaton2000: the problem is not that useful
 Astrobytes: Autolag2000
 icecream17: in JS I just named my function class "Object" and it worked....
 Lekato: :grin:
 IfIHadATail: so, yeah, Restarting my computer fix everything :embarrassed: lol thank you guys for your time&#160;: ) 
 ThaddeusQ3: vb.net question. How do I create a new dictionary in the iDE? I've tried every combination of declarations I can find and each time it tells me that "Dictionary" is not declared. 
 ThaddeusQ3: Same problem as with HashTable
 ThaddeusQ3: *same problem with HashTable
 ThaddeusQ3: Doing the MIME Type puzzle
 ThaddeusQ3: Example: Dim dictExtTypes As Dictionary(Of string, string)()
 AntiSquid: well either you do it wrong and should google it or it's a bug and should report it, maybe on forums or maybe on discord chat
 ThaddeusQ3: Didn't read my post huh? Got about 2 words into it or what?
 Astrobytes: ThaddeusQ3 1. I suggest you chill out and fix your attitude a little2. You forgot to do something
 ThaddeusQ3: I presumed that I forgot to do something. Telling me "go to google" when it clearly says in my inquiry that I've been searching is a pretty harsh middle finger.
 Astrobytes: Welp. I googled and I know what you haven't done.
 ThaddeusQ3: I'm reaching out for *help*
 Astrobytes: Where would you find the definition of Dictionary?
 ThaddeusQ3: Been to here

 Astrobytes: Think in simpler terms
 Astrobytes: Look at the top of your code. See anything?
 ThaddeusQ3: So I need to include a library or something similiar
 Astrobytes: Do you normally develop in VB.Net?
 ThaddeusQ3: no. learning. I normally program PLC's in ladder logic and am trying to expand my skillset.
 Astrobytes: Right, in the .NET world you have to import what you need
 Astrobytes: So you'll import whatever you need from whichever namespace it's located in
 ThaddeusQ3: ok. That's the kind of help I was looking for. Thank you.
 Terrain2: Hello
 Astrobytes: So go check out the namespaces and whatnot, get familiar
 ThaddeusQ3: I know a little about them some from years ago in school. Did some C++ stuff. 
 Astrobytes: In the .NET case it's a bit more Java-like. 
 ThaddeusQ3: hmm...that doesn't help me much
 ThaddeusQ3: don't know much about java
 Astrobytes: Just making the distinction between this and the C++ you remember
 ThaddeusQ3: ah! there we go. 
 Astrobytes: Look up VB.NET namespaces and importing them, you'll find what you need quickly
 Astrobytes: lol, don't worry
 Astrobytes: Oh you got it, cool.
 AntiSquid: didn't mean to come across like i am showing you the middle finger ThaddeusQ3, but it's pretty much one of the two options
 ThaddeusQ3: what does the red text mean? Is that a PM?
 AntiSquid: no, just mention
 ThaddeusQ3: how to do?
 AntiSquid: everyone can see it
 Astrobytes: Just type the person's name
 AntiSquid: just write user's name you want to mention
 ThaddeusQ3: Antisquid Test
 ThaddeusQ3: @Antisquid Test
 AntiSquid: ya i see it red, but i could be lying right? :p
 Astrobytes: Also, if you type the first few letters then press Tab it will autocomplete
 Astrobytes: Just check it autocompletes correctly :P
 ThaddeusQ3: Astrobytes This is another test
 Astrobytes: Test OK
 Astrobytes: ThaddeusQ3
 ThaddeusQ3: kk. Thanks 
 AntiSquid: progressing in a multi with more players is still more rewarding in CP
 Astrobytes: He's just practising VB AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: top of gold XR just 1200 CP, #110 in gold crystal rush 2.2k CP and i have like a page of TODOs or stuff to try out ... 
 AntiSquid: just rambling about my bots Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Oh I get you
 Astrobytes: Still no XR legend?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: i get pushed down actually
 AntiSquid: it's like people only improved to push me down @_@
 Astrobytes: lol, always feels like that
 AntiSquid: i didn't touch XR for over a month now
 Astrobytes: Well, still time before the contest
 AntiSquid: but it's kinda true for xr, i mean i was close to promo and then few peeps suddenly feel like submitting and they submit strong bots that drop me, nothing experimental that promotes me so yes it does feel that way
 Astrobytes: XR gold is not fun
 AntiSquid: i need to optimize it
 AntiSquid: it's very slow
 AntiSquid: and i don't make full use of the time
 Astrobytes: Mines is a disgrace. How it's 60th is miraculous. I ca barely read the code.
 Astrobytes: *can
 AntiSquid: i rewrote mine after ooc
 AntiSquid: and then copied a few bits in from the old one see what to keep / discard
 AntiSquid: old one was rank 550 in gold :D
 Nerchio: silver bot in crystal rush
 Nerchio: so good
 Nerchio: should be illegal
 AntiSquid: well game is very random so from what i remember to promote i had to do on tactic back then and then switch to different strategy in gold
 AntiSquid: but if gold and silver were merged and a recalc took place there would be heavy shuffle
 AntiSquid: quite sure top 200 silver and bottom 200 gold are very similar if not same in strength, all about right strategy for the bots you encounter
 Nerchio: probably true
 Nerchio: i guess i will try to force myself to gold with some submits i am doing quite consistent atm
 romrd468: is oversteering or understeering better in CSB
 icecream17: like, turning or speed?
 romrd468: like closer targets or farther
 romrd468: close print or farther print?
 icecream17: sorry, my brain interpreted that as (go closer to targets or farther).... idk what you mean....
 AntiSquid: it's more like you can keep tweaking the variables, submit, see results and repeat 
 romrd468: should I have more or less velocity
 AntiSquid: yes
 romrd468: Should I have precision steering or should I have speed steering
 AntiSquid: that's what tweaking implies, more or less, keep trying @_@
 icecream17: both? figure out how to speed by turning faster?
 romrd468: How can I tell my pod to go fast and slow?
 AntiSquid: be like water my friend
 reCurse: Fast: thrust 100
 reCurse: Slow: thrust 0
 reCurse: Really slow: shield
 Terrain2: hey so google is allowed, right?
 reCurse: In what context
 Terrain2: clash of code
 icecream17: as long as it's not suspicious and  learning
 reCurse: It's unenforceable so sure
 romrd468: currently my steering is at .01 is that precision enough?
 AntiSquid: uhm :thinking: well screw clash, so yes&#160;?
 reCurse: Steering at .01 means nothing
 reCurse: It's as if I ask you whether my win constant at 7 is good
 AntiSquid: it's good 7 lucky number
 AntiSquid: so people claim
 Astrobytes: It's good. But only if x == 1337
 icecream17: go at "checkpoint x squared" mod "numApples".
 romrd468: haha I just created gandolf code
 AntiSquid: was about to say i prefer 13, but your number is better in this context Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: 7 is a lucky number AntiSquid? It's my birthday and I'm practically cursed I'm so unlucky :D
 romrd468: you shall not pass!
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes not sure how you are unlucky, but 7 being lucky is a common urban myth
 Astrobytes: Oh my whole family is cursed, you wouldn't believe half of it. But nevermind that, what about the 7? Never heard that before
 AntiSquid: romrd468 get an avatar 
 Astrobytes: *anime avatar
 reCurse: Never heard of lucky 7s?
 Astrobytes: Only in the context of fruit machines/bandits
 AntiSquid: why does the jackpot machine have a 7 on a the rolls&#160;?
 AntiSquid: even outside that 
 romrd468: I times my vx by 3.14 and it went in circles
 reCurse: Sounds like a question for google
 Astrobytes: It's religious. Next.
 romrd468: how close can you get to zero while still having an impact?
 AntiSquid: In many cultures around the world, seven is considered a lucky number. ... Some people believe it is, but this belief may simply stem from the positive things often associated with the number. Like most beliefs associated with the concept of luck, superstition plays a large role in perpetuating the belief.
 AntiSquid: copied from google
 Astrobytes: Yes, it all stems from religious texts. Like I said. Next
 AntiSquid: there's some biblical arguments in the results, tried to keep it neutral in that regard
 Astrobytes: romrd468 why are you multiplying your velocity by pi?
 MSmits: to go in circles. He just said that
 MSmits: sigh
 Astrobytes: No that's the result. his intention is unclear MSmits :P
 AntiSquid: ya Astrobytes he just said that!
 MSmits: o
 reCurse: Because it sounds fancier to multiply vel by pi than 3.
 Astrobytes: Shuddup AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: i actually tried pi too
 AntiSquid: it's good he understand he needs to try random stuff if he just wants to make things magically happen
 Astrobytes: I spent ages on steering behaviours and shit, even made a little offline visualiser, got to gold, then discovered the trick. That's why I warn people off of the shortcut. 
 reCurse: I thought it was my secret&#160;:(
 MSmits: wanna hear something really funny
 AntiSquid: this was back when i started and gradually made some improvements, was always suggested to add the -3vel no matter what, although it was in there already -.-
 AntiSquid: a certain madao kept telling me to add it, forgot he told me and told me again
 reCurse: madsnowflake
 Astrobytes: hehe
 AntiSquid: still trying to ban Automaton2020 
 MSmits: so remember how I've been fitting onitama for like a week, prolly thousands of cg bench games
 Astrobytes: MSmits tell us your funny something
 Astrobytes: o
 MSmits: i got a pretty good bot now
 MSmits: but
 Astrobytes: And you threw away all your benchmarks?
 MSmits: i got really spikey results
 MSmits: for constants
 AntiSquid: and how do you adjust vars? still the old fashion way?
 MSmits: like one ideal value and if i go right next to it, its 10% worse
 romrd468: I have 3 difference CSB bots I am combining
 MSmits: yes, but this is something else AntiSquid
 MSmits: i found out the reason why my constants are so sensitive
 MSmits: for a game thats quite random with the 300k card combinations
 Astrobytes: Because they are wrong?
 MSmits: no
 AntiSquid: using polymerization romrd468
 AntiSquid: use *
 MSmits: because all of my thousands of games were done with the same 5 cards :P
 MSmits: I have just been swapping games on those cards, both sides
 Astrobytes: You knob :D
 MSmits: but it never saw the other 10 cards
 MSmits: but got nr 1 with that so thats cool :p\
 Astrobytes: Jeez
 AntiSquid: that's like getting #1 for perfecting a bot for 1 seed
 MSmits: compare these two:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/628509da-b11b-4185-8ef7-9fe68d806859">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/628509da-b11b-4185-8ef7-9fe68d806859</a>
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-onitama/MSmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-onitama/MSmits</a>
 MSmits: look at the difference in how strong the bot seems to be
 MSmits: see how badly i overfitted for this seed
 MSmits: yes AntiSquid, that is it exactly
 AntiSquid: ok
 MSmits: so on the seed i am 80% + and on the cg stats i am around 50-60
 MSmits: even my exploration parameter would drop my winrate from 80% to 70% if i made it go from 1.21 to 1.20
 Astrobytes: Epic
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/GyybpHL">https://imgur.com/a/GyybpHL</a>
 romrd468: anyone notice that in CSB going to bots like the top left corner?
 MSmits: so I am going to have to start over :P
 MSmits: with this as a base I guess
 Astrobytes: lol, pretty specific
 MSmits: I'm also going to have to bring back the 4 eval features i discarded as useless. They may have been useless only for this seed
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 MSmits: well this is what i get for only playing games with no random like oware and uttt
 Astrobytes: Every day's a school day Mr Bits
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: btw,  i finished the harvard cs 50
 romrd468: madknight gave me bad advice go figure
 AntiSquid: :o
 AntiSquid: shots fired
 Astrobytes: What was the bad advice he gave you romrd468?
 romrd468: He said to use the vel*3 and it made my code worse
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: maybe your code is bugged
 MSmits: well you had pi before
 MSmits: pi &gt; 3
 Astrobytes: hehe, like I said earlier, please try to understand what that does
 MSmits: romrd468 are you in gold?
 romrd468: yeah
 AntiSquid: the idea is to always use full velocity and then target an area before the next check point so you turn much faster to get ready for next checkpoint romrd468
 MSmits: then it's time to either A) go to a different game or B) learn how to write search algorithms
 AntiSquid: full speed i mean
 MSmits: the sunglasses dude is a B
 Astrobytes: heh
 reCurse: I've heard a rumor some people got to legend without search
 AntiSquid: that's me
 reCurse: So definitely a rumor
 MSmits: sure that may be possible, but why bother, you're just hitting the same kind of ceiling a little higher
 romrd468: I had a glitch which made me go after 2 checkpoints at once and somehow I still went through both
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 AntiSquid: i used vel*2.98&#160;!!
 AntiSquid: obv the real legend constant
 AntiSquid: and had a blocker
 MSmits: which did -3 vel on his runner?
 AntiSquid: idk, i forgot
 Astrobytes: I just #include &lt;Madeleine&gt;
 Astrobytes: and then call MK::FixIt()
 AntiSquid: MSmits didn't like CSB, just did random submits for legend to then try something else, madao was nagging in chat all day and pinging everyone new
 Astrobytes: woops, and don't forget to set MK::EZPZ to true;
 Astrobytes: *.
 AntiSquid: there was more, constant promotion of inoryy starter bot ... and how the other guy got top 50 with it, got really irritating at some point
 AntiSquid: "write a simu, how is your simu?"
 MSmits: AntiSquid I don't like it much either. I only kept going cuz it went so well, succes motivates. I really dont want to go back to it though
 reCurse: Most satisfying game to watch though, maybe only second to FB
 MSmits: i like to watch onitama&#160;:)
 romrd468: Angle to vector program initialized
 MSmits: probably should have watched my cg bench games though :flushed:
 romrd468: if same target drop a nuclear bomb on their pod
 reCurse: ecks dee
 Astrobytes: CSB with weaponry would certainly be... interesting
 MSmits: that's mario kart
 MSmits: and
 MSmits: yes please&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: romrd468 why don't you try mini max? there are grenades 
 AntiSquid: mean max multi meant
 AntiSquid: kinda sleepy
 Astrobytes: Magic algos create new game features
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: magic algos?
 MSmits: locam?
 Astrobytes: no, Squid's magic mini max that creates grenades
 romrd468: I can throw your pods off screen XD
 reCurse: ecks dee
 Astrobytes: lel
 Nerchio: crystal rush gold hard earned xD
 romrd468: strategy = one ram while using shield two is boost after to make sure they dead 
 Astrobytes: grats Nerchio
 MSmits: gj Nerchio
 AntiSquid: hard coded and then just a bit more hard coding and legend&#160;!
 AntiSquid: gj 
 Nerchio: not much hard coding so far :p
 AntiSquid: no fixed radar placement&#160;?
 Nerchio: ok that i have :D
 Nerchio: but nothing except that
 Astrobytes: Still can't bring myself to paly that game again
 Astrobytes: Or play it
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: I couldnt even finish the contest
 MSmits: only time i ever dropped out during
 AntiSquid: you would have dropped out of ooc if it were 1 week
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: i might have made different decisions
 Astrobytes: It started at what could be described as a 'difficult' time in my life, plus I didn't really like it
 AntiSquid: actually i wanted to drop out of ooc day 1, right there in wood2 :D
 MSmits: i didnt hate ooc
 MSmits: wasnt the most fun contest ever, but it was ok
 MSmits: for me that is
 Astrobytes: I liked OOC more, but in a relative to 'Crystal Rush' way
 reCurse: I'd like a break on fog of war
 reCurse: Possibly forever
 Astrobytes: Yeeeep
 MSmits: you mean you want a game with full knowledge?
 AntiSquid: on hidden information
 AntiSquid: not fond of it and ooc i dislike the most
 MSmits: i think its different in ooc because the hidden information is the whole game. In most other games it's just a small feature of it like in utg or wondev woman
 Astrobytes: Compared to UTG? 
 reCurse: Probability stuff with CG's architecture is straight up masochism
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: why
 MSmits: what do you need for probability stuff?
 AntiSquid: one of the reasons is the character limit
 reCurse: Better sampling
 AntiSquid: ooc and UTG are screaming at you to do some sort of statistics
 Astrobytes: But you need more games, and that's just never gonna happen
 Amirabbas: hello i got a question about the privite clash of code .... if i play on match with my friends can we play again or should we generate new link to share.?..my friends arent here right now i want to know 
 MSmits: true i did use a bit of statistics for ooc, but the biggest part of the code is tracking and managing states
 AntiSquid: wondev woman didn't seem that bad to me, but it was my first contest ... right now i think ooc is #1 worst game, and utg #2 worst
 MSmits: i think every clash is a new link
 MSmits: Amirabbas
 MSmits: what did you like most AntiSquid?
 Amirabbas: thanks ...is there anymone here to join just to try...just skip the test 
 reCurse: Trick question: nothing
 AntiSquid: kutulu
 Astrobytes: Code Royale was my firs AntiSquid and it seemed fun at the time, I hate it with every cell in my body now
 MSmits: i liked it too
 MSmits: i am trying to think of one i liked more
 MSmits: I think code royale doesnt count  for me because it was my first... big thrill 
 AntiSquid: lol why not&#160;?
 MSmits: well looking at it objectively it was far from the best contest
 blasterpoard: huh? I though kutulu was kinda bad
 MSmits: I enjoyed it a lot though
 AntiSquid: ya well opinions
 blasterpoard: waaaay too simple if you realize what's important in that game
 Amirabbas: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12058083f5fbffed78f77b9bf31858b7e192dde">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12058083f5fbffed78f77b9bf31858b7e192dde</a> id be happy if anyone just join and then skip the test dont anser just to test if i can remach
 MSmits: every game is equally hard blasterpoard, everything thats easy for you is also easy for the opponents
 AntiSquid: well someone was saying it's too complicated with too many things to take into account
 MSmits: well 4p is always hard to write a search for
 blasterpoard: MSmits well, I have a #5 if/else bot on the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Don't spam those clash links in chat please Amirabbas, people will join your clash if you make it and they want to clash
 MSmits: blasterpoard that might be a sign that its hard, not that it's easy&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: how many things do you precompute blasterpoard&#160;?
 MSmits: if it's hard to write a search, then people use heuristics
 blasterpoard: AntiSquid line of sight and distance between all pairs of squares
 MSmits: me too
 Amirabbas: i undrestand i just want to test smh no playing...i want to see if we can have a remach in privite once
 blasterpoard: also number of turns for a slasher to reach a square by rushing then moving
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: btw some of these things are pretty hard to do in the calc time available if you use C#
 MSmits: have to be careful about optimizing your BFS and such
 blasterpoard: my bot is not optimized at all
 MSmits: it;s also probably c++ :P
 blasterpoard: and I didn't have optimization pragmas during the contest
 AntiSquid: ok so doesn't this come down to preferences then? if you like to extract lots of hidden info then that's your kinda game no?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: For sure
 MSmits: i prefer full knowledge, but I was ok with it in ooc
 Astrobytes: There's a bunch of games on here for most tastes I reckon
 MSmits: oh, strangely enough i liked code a la mode&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Just the last 2 contests have been heavy on the missing info
 MSmits: just people not taking my plate... that I hated
 Astrobytes: F that cooking game
 AntiSquid: code a la mode was about reading brainless coworker
 MSmits: ye, i assumed brains
 AntiSquid: will he save the food from burning? bot always worked better when i guessed NO
 blasterpoard: UTG high legend was mostly rock/paper/scissors because of the fog of war
 MSmits: it's right there! You're next to the damn window, pick up the dam plate!!!
 AntiSquid: so what's the best game on cg blasterpoard&#160;?
 Astrobytes: *what's your favourite game
 blasterpoard: AntiSquid idk... the same I liked the most so far was, to my surprise, halite 3
 blasterpoard: *game
 Astrobytes: On CG tho
 MSmits: on CG\
 blasterpoard: I know, that's why I wrote the "idk"
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 MSmits: pick one
 AntiSquid: cg being inferior to halite 3 :thinking: 
 Astrobytes: OK, exluding Halite 3
 reCurse: There's no bad answer, except for c4l of course
 Astrobytes: *Excluding
 <b>**MSmits hopes blasterpoard says uttt</b></p><p><img src="/a/36336680250371" /> blasterpoard: no, I tried uttt, and I got bored
 <b>**Astrobytes thinks MSmits is attempting to troll reCurse</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: :innocent:
 MSmits: blasterpoard do you enjoy board games at all?
 MSmits: or does it have to be a more complex simulated game?
 MSmits: if so, do you prefer one with physics or a grid based one
 blasterpoard: I don't like it when all I can do is a search algo
 MSmits: how about ghost in the cell
 MSmits: search does work somewhat, but not that well, most use heuristics, but not all
 blasterpoard: I used to not like physics, but now I don't really mind, after dealing with the worst physics iof all the games
 blasterpoard: ( AntiSquid knows what I'm talking about )
 AntiSquid: you mean worst randomness i think
 MSmits: Raic?
 AntiSquid: oh wow wait that was worse
 AntiSquid: but no
 blasterpoard: MSmits I'll PM you
 MSmits: kk
 AntiSquid: imagine RaiC except bullets can randomly go through walls
 reCurse: I want a name and/or URL
 AntiSquid: or randomly blow your opponent off the map
 Astrobytes: wtf
 MSmits: super smash brothers
 Astrobytes: Name and shame or forever be damned
 icecream17: YES! My blocker is... sort of working! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456284936">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456284936</a>
 Illedan: blasterpoard, what game? :P
 MSmits: icecream the blocker is supposed to do more than be a goal post
 reCurse: I forgot how slow csb is before legend
 Nerchio: when will we get more info about spring challenge
 MSmits: in 6 days, 17 hrs 2 mins and 48 seconds
 MSmits: 44
 Nerchio: no more teasers?: p
 Nerchio: sounds like bad promotion xD
 MSmits: ah well maybe a few hrs before, or a day, but nothing that is helpful
 reCurse: It's pac man with powers, what more do you want :P
 AntiSquid: maybe an email with a screenshot from thibaud
 MSmits: a selfie?
 AntiSquid: 1-2 hours before contest
 MSmits: look at me being happy knowing the game while you're all waiting
 AntiSquid: yes MSmits, his webcam pic next to the game viewer
 icecream17: if you go into the console....
 MSmits: aha
 icecream17: and type "codingame"...
 icecream17: codingame.session has "codinGamer" but even more interesting an empty array "newFeatures" hmm
 reCurse: h4x0r
 icecream17: What if you do... codingame.session.codinGamer.xp = Infinity
 MSmits: allright getting some sleep, gn
 Nerchio: cya
 Astrobytes: nn
 AntiSquid: gn8
 AntiSquid: nice you're halfway through gold
 Nerchio: who
 AntiSquid: you
 Nerchio: hehe ye thats actually the first commit
 Nerchio: i didn't program since then
 Nerchio: lots of stuff to fix for sure
 Nerchio: i added the basic trap prediction like you(?) i think said
 Nerchio: where you assume they took the trap if they were 1 turn at spawn
 AntiSquid: no idea what i said anymore tbh
 Nerchio: could be someone else that said this though xD
 AntiSquid: ya
 Nerchio: maybe cpt blasterpoard
 AntiSquid: ctp *
 Astrobytes: AT least 3 people mentioned it from what I saw in today's/tonight'  chat
 Astrobytes: And I wasn't here the whole time :P
 struct: mentioned what?
 Astrobytes: (I'm joking)
 blasterpoard: Nerchio how about bots who pick up the mine, leave 1st column, return there without digging, and then go place it?
 Astrobytes: Trap prediction in UTG struct
 Astrobytes: Remember that game? :P
 struct: Never heard of it
 struct: Is it still here?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Crystal Rush now
 Nerchio: blasterpoard at the moment I coded really general trap prediction I didn't play with nuances
 Nerchio: main goal so far was to get as much ore as possible without losing bots
 Nerchio: otherwise i would stay in silver forever
 Nerchio: but at some point i will probably add 'tricks' to my bot as well
 Nerchio: so its not so easy to predict my traps
 blasterpoard: don't focus on that
 blasterpoard: just don't lose bots and make stashes
 Nerchio: i think losing 1 turn here and there for each bot is not the biggest deal and can throw off a lot of people on my way to legend
 Nerchio: didn't work with stashes yet, do you mean gatherin ore to 1 spot and collecting it later?
 blasterpoard: yes
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456288847">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456288847</a> btw your mine detection isn't that good
 blasterpoard: or do you only try to not dig them up?
 blasterpoard: that's not enough
 Nerchio: yeah so far ye
 Nerchio: you blew it up yeah?
 blasterpoard: yes
 Nerchio: my bots shouldn't mine this
 blasterpoard: blowing up mines intentionally is very common in gold, even more so in legend
 Nerchio: yeah i have some small code as well
 Nerchio: if i have the chance i will blow it up 1 for 2+
 AntiSquid: doesn't that take more time? your bot spends a turn placing the ore into stash, later on another bot spends 1 turn digging it out
 blasterpoard: you don't really have to do it, just don't lose 2 bors for 1
 blasterpoard: AntiSquid you increase opponent's travel time a lot
 Nerchio: yeah i will see how often it happens in gold
 struct: a lot
 Nerchio:  how do you increase opponents travel time because of stashes?
 Illedan: TravelTime++;
 Nerchio: stopEnemyBot=true
 reCurse: opponent-&gt;TravelTime++;
 reCurse: Illenoob
 AntiSquid: place construction site signs around your digging area :p
 reCurse: Hmm, Illedanoob works better
 Illedan: noobCurse
 blasterpoard: Nerchio the opponent has to travel far to collect ore in the late game; you can just collect the stashes
 Nerchio: yea but you're not collecting as well?
 Illedan: Not:opponent-&gt;++TravelTime;reCurse?
 blasterpoard: Nerchio I do collect it eventually
 struct: ++opponent-&gt;TravelTime
 struct:&#160;;
 blasterpoard: but I get more of the ore closer to the 1st column
 blasterpoard: so I travel less
 Astrobytes: Noobedan
 Nerchio: that's probably more of legend tactics :p
 blasterpoard: no, that's high gold
 Astrobytes: reNoob
 blasterpoard: high legend is trying to figure out what can you mine safely
 AntiSquid: opponent-&gt;operator[](i)-&gt;TravelTime++;
 Nerchio: i will probably start with splitting my bots against mines looks like it happens quite often in gold
 tecnosam: print("Hello World")
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456290055">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456290055</a> here's a replay against squid; notice how far to the right he has to go to get ore
 Your_Lord_And_Savior: OOOF
 Your_Lord_And_Savior: :rage:
 AntiSquid: ya i am horrible at collecting ore on top of that
 Astrobytes: if (screwed) goto IncrementOpponentTravelTime;
 blasterpoard: I just needed to find a bot that doesn't explode in first 20 turns and doesn't make stashes
 Nerchio: :D
 reCurse: I approve of antisquid getting rekt
 AntiSquid: ^ i thought it's a compliment to not explode in first 20 turns
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456290785">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456290785</a> just had to play 1 more game against you
 blasterpoard: and you explode as well
 Nerchio: blasterpoard dunking on golds&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i thought i fixed that&#160;:/
 Nerchio: that's probably the first thing i will try to fix
 AntiSquid: it thinks it does a good trade for some reason
 Astrobytes: #include &lt;Madeleine&gt; AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ah nvm blaster dug that 
 AntiSquid: my bot used to be very suicidal
 blasterpoard: Nerchio yes, not exploding is quite important
 Astrobytes: "not exploding is quite important" - words to live by
 reCurse: Unless it's exploding your enemies
 Astrobytes: Of course. Context is king
 Astrobytes: *everything. Fixed my sexism.
 reCurse: Check your privilege
 blasterpoard: I'm surprised by how often it happens agianst gold bots, considering that I only do it if I randomly happen to be nxt to a mine that happens to be next to 2+ opponent's bots
 Astrobytes: triggered
 blasterpoard: (maybe 1+, I don't remember)
 Nerchio: probably because it requires quite a big more logic
 Nerchio: you can say DIG not being close to a dig and it will take you there
 Nerchio: but now you need to predict if 2 of your bots will be close to each other 
 blasterpoard: that's why the move command is there
 Nerchio: i know but as i said it requires a lot more logic :D
 Nerchio: because now I need not only to check where my bots will end up but also where is a good spot for them to move
 Nerchio: that's not a problem ofcourse just saying it's much easier in this game to code a base bode without logic like this
 AntiSquid: my bot places a lot of mines and it doesn't do any man spreading
 Nerchio: lol
 Nerchio: code + bot = bode
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manspreading">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manspreading</a>
 blasterpoard: good bot
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: was a joke, i don't keep them apart, high chance they land next to a bomb together
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out. Good night, dobru noc, bonne nuit, noapte buna
 blasterpoard: the biggest bug in my bot is that I don't avoid having 2+ bots aroung my non-mined stashes
 Nerchio: yeah hehe
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456290835">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456290835</a>
 Nerchio: i exploded antisquid too :D
 AntiSquid: do i really need to fix that next? don't feel like it :p
 Nerchio: probably helps with consistency
 Nerchio: losing 2 bots for 1 is pretty much auto-loss
 Nerchio: ok i go to bed cya guys
